      <field name="fulltext">A Floorish vpon Fancie.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. As gallant a Glose, vpon so trifling a text as euer, was written. Compiled by N. B. Gent. To all younge Gentilmen, That delight in trauaile to Forreine Countreis. THE PREFACE. A Prouerbe olde, and therewith true there is, That haste makes waste: ech thing must haue his time: Who high aspires must ever looke to this,— To marke his steppes before he ginne to clime: For who in climing takes no care at all, Ere he get vp, is like to catch a fall. Who dooth desire to HONOR high to clime, By due desart, must woorshippe first attaine: Then for to seeke, in farther tract of time, The meane, whereby to HONOR to attaine: For he that thinkes to be a Lorde first day, Will misse a Lorde, and prooue a Loute, straight way. Who doth assault the huge high FORT OF FAME, Must first beginne to scale the outward walles: Long is the Ladder that dooth reach the same, And happie he that gets vp without falles: Tedious the time, the labour nothing short, To take in hande to scale so high a Forte. This Prouerbe olde, my selfe obserued well, Who not assault the gallant FORT OF FAME: But FANCIES FORTE, not minding there to dwell, But for to see the secretes of the same: And many times I thought to make retire, But in the ende obtainéd my desire. I scalde the walles, and got into the Fort With ease inough, short time and little fight: And there I sawe whereof I make report, Eche thinge that was for to be seene worth sight: And when that I sometime therein had past, How, by good hap, I got away at last. Now farre from this, I see THE FORT OF FAME, A harder thinge, to giue assault vnto: I dare not seeke the meane, to scale the same, And, if I durst, I knowe not what to do: In scalinge Fortes, my skill is too too small, Then if I clime, I needes must catch a fall. By lying still, I can but little gaine, By climing too, the feare is but a fall: No praise in deede is gotten without paine, Small hurte by falles, if bruze growe not withall: No bruze nor fall takes hee that takes good heede, No taking heede, great haste and little speede. Then when I clime, my selfe am warnde to learne The way to scale, ere ought I take in hande: To set my LADDER, wisely to discerne, To choose a place, where it may surely stande: Then for to make my LADDER of such stuffe As I may trust, to treade on sure ynouffe. But then the ROVNDES must not be made of RIMES, My feete will slippe, in treading on the same: And REASON sayes, that who so fondly clymes, Falles downe into the Ditche of foule Defame: God keepe me thence, and helpe me so to clime, That REASON yet, may rayse me vp in time. FINIS. THE SCHOOLE OF FANCIE. Methinkes I see you smile, before you gin to reede, At this same title of my Tale: but, for you shall not neede, To maruaile at the same. First, read it to the ende, And marke ye still, through all the tale, wherto eche point dooth tend: And you shall see I hope, that this same title serues Fit for this tale: els, sure my minde from reason greatly swarues: Who is expert in any Arte, dooth beare a Maisters name: Then he who cheefe is in an Art, dooth well deserue the same. Of Arte of lucklesse Loue, first Fancie is the ground, Although that Cupid, with his Dart, doo giue the deadly wounde. First, Fancie liking breedes, and liking breedeth Loue, And Loue th? breeds such passing pangs, as many Louers prooue: And when the troubled minde, with torments is opprest, Fancie dooth finde some secret meane, to breede the hart some rest: And Fancie, shee sometime, to breede the Louers ioy, A thousand sundrie wayes (at least) dooth still her paines imploy: She thinkes on this and that, shee teacheth how to looue, And tels the Louer what to doo, as best for his behooue. But least I go to farre, and run too much at large Out of the waye, and take no care what thing I haue in charge: I will begin to show, what kinde of Schoole this is, What orders too shee keepes therein. First, lo the Schoole is this. The roome bothe large and long, and very darke of sight, The most sight that her Schollers haue, is chieflie by fier light: Which fier dooth burne so bright, as giues them light to see To read such books, as there are taught: but what this fier may bee, Nowe thereby lyes a case. Well marke what I doo wright, And you shall know: for I my selfe, haue seene it burning bright. First, Fancie fetcheth coales, and calles for Deepe desire: By him shee setteth Vaine delight, and biddes them blow the fire: And when the fire once burnes, for to maintaine the same, The Colier Care, hee brings in coales vnto this daintie Dame. Hee makes his Coales of wood, that growes on Haire braine hill: The Groue is cald, the Thriftles thicke of wilde and wanton will: The wood is of small groth, but stickes of Stubborne youth, Which serues as fittest for that fier, God wot, the greater ruthe: Lo thus, this fier dooth burne, and still dooth giue the light To Fancies Schollers in her Schoole: they haue none other sight: Now, Sir, in this hot Schoole, first Fancie highest sittes, And out of all her Schollers still, she takes the wildest wittes. And those she takes in hands, to teach the Art of loue: Which being taught in that vain Art, do soone fine schollers proue. She teacheth them to mourne, to flatter and to faine: To speake, to write, and to indight, to labor and take paine: To go, to run, and ride, to muse and to deuise: To iuggle with a deerest freend, to bleare the parents eyes: To spend both landes and goods, to venter Lim and life, To make foes frends, and twixt deere frends, to set debate &amp; strife: To doo, and vndoo too, so that they may obtaine, Their mistresse looue: and neuer care, for taking any paine. To iet in braue attire, to please their Mistris eye: Although perhaps they vtterly vndoe themselues thereby. To learne to singe and daunce, to play on Instruments, To speake choice of straunge languages, to trie experiments Straunge, seldome had in vse: in fine, to tell you plaine, To doo almoste they care not what, their Ladies loue to gaine: And thus in tract of time, by such instructions, Shee makes them tread, the perfect pathe to their destructions: Some other Schollers now, are taught within her Schoole By Vsshers that teach vnder her: of which one is a foole By nature and by name, for Follie men him call; And he will teach his Scholler soone, to prooue a Naturall. The second, Frenzie is, in teaching too as bad: For he will teach his Schollers most, the way to make them mad: The Vssher Follie first, he teacheth to be bould, Without aduice to giue no eare, to counsaile that is tould: To take delight in gauds, and foolish trifling toyes, In things of value, little worth, to set his chiefest ioyes. To prate without regarde, of reason in his talke, To think black white, and wrong for right, &amp; know not cheese fr? chalke: To loue the things in deede, which moste he ought to hate: For trifling toyes, with deerest freends, to fall at dire debate: To looue to play at Dice, to sware his blood and hart, To face it with a Ruffins looke, and set his Hat a thwart. To haunt the Tauernes late, by night to trace the streetes, And swap ech slut vpon the lippes, that in the darke he meetes: To laughe at a horse nest, and whine too like a boy, If any thing do crosse his minde, though it be but a toy: To slauer like a slaue, to lie too like a Dog, To wallow almost like a Beare, and snortle like a Hog. To feede too like a Horse, to drinke too like an Oxe, To shew himselfe in each respect, a very very Coxe. But such a Scholler now, is chosen of grose wit, Because that Beetle heads doo serue for such instructions fit. The other Usher now, that Frenzie hath to name, His kinde of teaching, hee againe, another waye dooth frame: Hee teacheth how to rage, to sweare and ban and curse, To fret, to fume, to chide, to chafe, to doo all this and worse. To teare his flesh for griefe, to fill the aire with cryes, To harbor hatred in his hart, and mischiefe to deuise: To hate all good aduice, to follow witlesse will, And, in the end, for want of grace, to seeke himselfe to kill. And sutch his Schollers are, ripe wits, but wanting grace, And sutch vngratious graffes, doo learne, sutch gracelesse geare apace: These Schollers all are young, except that now and than, To be a scholler with the rest, there step in som ould man. Who when that he a while, hath bin in Fancie's Schoole, Dooth learne in his olde crooked age, to play the doting foole. And such there are sometime, (more pittie) for to see, That in their crooked doting age, would faine fine louers bee. Which beeing in that Schoole, doo prooue, for all their paine, By Frenzie mad, by Folly fooles, or els by Fancie vaine. My selfe can tell too well, for I haue seen the Schoole, And learned so long there, till I prou'd more halfe a very foole. First, Fancie dandled me, and held me on her lap: And now and then, shee would me feede, with worldly pleasures pap. Shee tould mee, I was young, and I my youth must spend In youthfull sporte. I did not know, how soone my life would end: Be merry while I mought, Set carke and care aside: How mad were he, that mought in blisse, and would in bale abide? Such sugred speach of hers, had soone intrapt mee so, That I did thinke, that did me good, that wrought (in deed) my wo: Remayning thus a while, at last I had an eye To see how Folly taught his Youthes, and some rules, by and by, My selfe began to learne: First this, for to be bould, And to refuse to lend my eare, where good aduise was tould. In foolish trifling toyes to take a great delight: To take in hand to prate of that, wherein I had no sight. These rules I soone had learnd, but when I came to that, Where Ruffins card &amp; dice, and sweare, and ware aside their hat, I read no farther then, but up againe I went, Unto my Mistrisse Fancie fine: and straight downe shee me sent, Unto the nether ende of all her Schoole below, Where Frenzie sat: and sweating hard, he gan to puffe and blow. He little likte my minde, yet would I ye or no, I learnd some of his raging rules, ere I away did go: I learnd to fret and fume, though not to ban and curse, And oft for griefe, to sigh and sob, and many times doo worse: But yet, I thanke my God, I neuer had the will, In greatest franticke fit I felt, to seeke my selfe to kill. But to make short my tale, his lessons likte me not, But up againe in haste I went, to Fancie fond, God wot. And lying in her lap, I fell a sleepe anon: Where sleeping so, I dreamed sore that I was wo begon: Me thought that wisdome came, and warned mee in hast, To lothe sutch lessons as I learnd, ere that my youth were past. For short should be my sweet, and time would passe away: The man is in his graue too day that liued yesterday: Thy life (quod hee) poore soule, is like vnto a flower, That groweth but in daunger still of cropping euery hower: And if it be not cropt, yet soone it will decay, And like the flower, in little time, it wither will away. Thy pleasures wilbe paine, thy game will turne to greefe, And thou wilt seeke in vaine to late, when y? wouldst finde releef: Arise thou sluggish slaue, out of that lothsome lap, And be no longer like a Babe, so fed with pleasures pap. Lose no more labor so, in sutch a witles Schoole, Where as the best that thou canst gaine, is but to prooue a foole. Study some better Art, for lo thy wits will serue To learne to doo, that may in time, a good reward deserue: Better then best degree, that thou art like to take In Fancies schoole: I tell thee plaine, therefore I say, awake, Awake, in haste, awake, and hie thee hence, I say: Take warning in good time, poore soule, for time will sone away: But since that with such Youthes, words seldome will preuaile, With this same rod, thou foolish boy, I meane to breech thy taile. With which (me thought) he gaue a ierke, that made me smart: Which soden smart, although but small, yet made me give a start: And in my starting so, I waked sodenly; And so awakte, I cald to minde my vision by and by. Thus thinking on my dreame, I heauy grew in minde, Which by and by, when Fancie fond, gan by my counten?ce finde: How now, my youth (quoth she) what ailes thee seeme so sad? What c?st thou think to cheare thy minde, but that it shalbe had? No, no, (quoth I) I not beleeue these woords of thine. Thou sausy slaue (quoth she) darest y? mistrust these words of mine? And, therewith in a rage, Shee threwe me from her lap, And with the fall, be shrew her hart, I caught a cruell clap: Wherwith, sumthing displeasd, Why fine Mistris (quoth I) What can you bide no iest? alas,— And therwith, angerly, Without or taking leaue, or any duty done, From Fancie in a rage I flong, and out of dores I ronne: And beyng out of doore, these wordes me thought I said, Fie on thee FANCIE, flatteryng flyrt, I hold me wel apaide: That I am got away, out of thy skyllesse Scoole: For now I see, thou wentst about to make mee a right foole: But now, that I am out, by grace of God, I sweare, While I doo liue, if I can choose, neuer more to come there. But Fancie, hearing this, to make mee styll to stay, To fetche mee in with pleasant sportes inuented many a way: But when I dyd perceiue how neere mee still she came, Then from her quite I floong in haste, and so I left this Dame. Loe, thus I tell you how, I came from Fancies Scoole: Where, learnyng but a little while, I proou'd more halfe a foole: Wherfore, since my good hap, hath ben to come from thence, Although with labour lost, in deede, and some, too mutch expence: I now haue thought it good, to warne eche one my frende, To keepe themselues from Fancies Schoole, &amp; so I make an ende. FINIS. THE FORTE OF FANCIE. THE ARGUMENT. As FANCIE hath a SCOOLE, so hath she too a FORT, Of which, the chiefest points, my selfe, wyll somwhat make report. The ground wheron it stands, and the foundation then: How it is built, how it is kept, and by what kynde of men: What kinde of cheere she keepes, who are her chiefest gesse: What drink she drinks, who ar her cookes y? al her meat do dres: Whom most she loues, who is her foe, &amp; who againe her frend, And how the Fort may soone be scald, &amp; ther to make an ende. THE FORTE OF FANCIE. The ground wheron it stands, is haughtie Harebraine Hyll, Hard by the Thick I tould you, of wild and wanton will. The fond Foundation is, false Fortunes fickle wheele, Which neuer stands, but stil eche way, is ready for to reele: Now here, now there againe, with euerie blaste of winde: Not as she list, but as it most doth please Dame Fortunes mind. The House it selfe is calde, The Lodge of luckelesse Loue; Within the whiche are diuers roumes, beneath and eke aboue: The names wherof anon, I meane at large to showe: But first, the outside of this House, I must declare, I trow: The commyng to the same, the walles, the Gates, and then, The base courts, courts &amp; gardens then, &amp; then the gards of men: The Porters to the Doores, the Officers within: And therefore, thus in order, I wyll now my tale begyn. The commyng to the same, is by a great hie way, Faire beaten plaine, with Fooles footsteps, and troden euerie day: The Soyle is pleasant sure, bedeckt with gallant flowers, But, being gatherd once, wil scarce bide sweet aboue two houres: And in this Soyle, there standes, a Forrest large and wide, Which is wel stoard w? thicks &amp; woods, the beasts therin to hide: Of which great peece of grounde, for to declare the name, The Forrest (Sir) of Fooles it is: loe, now you know the same: And in this Forrest now, this beaten way doth lie, Which leadeth unto Harebraine Hyll, the right way redyly. At foote of this same Hyll, and round about the same, There is a Ditche, which Deepe deceipt is calde by name: Ouer this lies a Bridge, but trust mee, verie weake: For when you are in midst therof, then sodenly twyll breake: And downe into the diche, of Deepe deceipt you fall: Rise againe, as you can your selfe, you get small helps at all: The Bridge is calde, the breache of perfect amytie: Tis made of Hollow harts, of such as wanted honestie: Which, being rotten styll, wyll neuer beare the waight Of any man, but sodenly, downe casts hym in Deceight: Now sir, although you fall, no bones shall yet be burst, Nor what so euer hurt you take, you feele it not at furst: But beyng falne, if you can make a shift to swym, Though it be but a stroake or two, yet may you get up trym, Unto the bankes therof, and so by shrubs that growe Upon the bankes, to make a shift, vp to the gate to goe: But if you can not swym, you may catch such a fall, That you may chaunce, vnto your cost, to catch a bruse withall: Not swimming as in Seas, for feare in deepe to drowne, But swimming sir, in Worldly wealth, for feare of fallyng downe. But if that you can swym, then soone perhappes you may, By shrubs and bushes, to the Gates make shift to finde a way. Then beeing at the gates, there shall you standing finde A peltikg patch for Porter there, of nature very kinde: His name is Daliance: a foolish crafty knaue, Who needeth not, to let you in, too much intreatie haue. Welcome, good Sir (saith he) now trust me, by my fay, I thinke that you have trauailed a wery peece of way: Wilt please you to go in, and take a little rest? Thus by the Porter Daliance, you go in as a guest. Now if up to the gate you cannot finde the way, Then lustely to scale the walles you must somewhat assay: Which walles you soone may scale, if you will take the paine, Or els may quickly beat them downe with beetel of your braine: Few are to make defence, and such as are, will stay Their hands from dooing harm to you, but rather, make you way. And shall I show in kinde, what gallants you shall see? That for to garde this Forte are set, and what their weapons bee? It were a sporte to tell, to set them out in kinde: Well, I wyll showe them all, as well as I can beare in minde: First, loe, a Garde of Geese and Ganders, in one rancke, With doutie Duckes and Drakes hard by, vpon an other bancke: A sight of Asses then, there stoode in Battell ray, With Iackeanapeses on their backes: and they stoode in the way That leades into the Court: further you can not passe, Except you let a Iackeanapes, to ride you lyke an Asse. But if you wyll do so, then may you passe vp straight, Into th'inner Court (forsooth) where long you shall not waight, But out vnto the doore, comes out an officer, And gently (Sir) into the Hall, this man wyll you preferre: But now sir, wyll you know, what meanes these Armies so, That standes to gard Dame Fancies Fort? well marke, &amp; you shal know. The Gard of Geese are first, Vngratious Graftes of Youth, That wallow euery wanton way, and misse the trackt of trueth. The Duckes (good Syr) are Doults, as well both yong as olde, That in that carelesse Court are set, to keepe a foolysh holde. The Asses they are Loutes, of wisdome none at all: Yet haue a certaine kinde of wit, to play the fooles withall. The Apes, that rides them now, and rules them euerie way, &amp; turne their heads which way they list, a thousand times a day, Are Foolysh Apish toyes, fond heads for to delite: Not voide of reason vtterly, though voide of wisdome quite. Their Weapons are their Tongues, wherewith they make a crye, Away, I say, away, stand backe, soft Syr, you come not by: But if so bee they see, one ridden like an Asse, Then will they make but small a doo, but let him gently passe. Now Syr, thus like an Asse, he goes to the Hall doore, And there becomes a Man againe, and stands an Asse no more: Yet though his eares grow short, he is not altered so, But he shall beare an Asses head, where euer so he go. And be he Man or Asse, Jacke an apes hee must beare, As long as hee is in that Forte, or els he bides not there. Now Syr, at the Hall dore, the Porter Pleasure standes: He looks for, ere he farther go, some money at his hands. He lets in none for thankes, he must haue money, hee: He goes not in els, I am sure, for so hee delt with mee. But if hee him rewarde, he brings him to the Hall, And there the Vsher, by and by, good Syr, hee meetes withall. Hee entertaines you then, in such a pleasaunt wise, As makes you thinke you are arriude, in place of Paradise. Not long he bides with you, but to the Chamberlaine Hee brings you vp, where curiously hee dooth you entertaine With Bezoles manos, imbrasings downe to knee: With Cap of curtesie: and a grace, the brauest that may bee. This is a gentle youth, but ere I farther go, The names of these same Officers, I plainely meane to show: The Vsher of the Hall, is called Vaine delight: Hee entertaineth none, except he be some witlesst wight. The Chamberlaine is called Curiositie, And fellow with this Vaine delight, and of affinitie: For at request of this, his fellow, Fond delight, Hee brings you where of Fancie faire, you soone may haue a sight: And if you like him well, hee workes so in the ende, That hee will in your sute, foorthwith, cause Fancie stande your freend. To Fancie then, good Sir, he brings you, by and by, And there may you beholde her, how she sitteth gallantlie: Her Chamber large and long, bedect with thousand toyes: Braue hanging clothes of rare deuise, pictures of naked boyes, And Girles too, now and then, of sixeteene yeeres of age: That will within a yeare or two, grow fit for mariage. But they must haue a Lawne, a Scarfe, or some sutch toy, To shrowde their shamefastnes withall: but if it be a boy, Hee standes without a Lawne, as naked as my naile: For Fancie hath a sporte sumtime, to see a naked taile. Besides, in pictures too, and toyes of straung deuise, With stories of olde Robin Hood, and Walter little wise: Some showes of warre long since, and Captaines wounded sore, And souldiers slaine at one conflict, a thousand men and more: Of hunting of wilde Beastes, as Lions, Bores, and Beares: To see how one an other oft, in sunder straungely teares. Of gallant Citties, Townes: of Gardens, Flowers, and trees: Of choise of pleasant herbs, and fruits, and such like toies as these: These hange aboute the walles, the floore now is troade With pleasant flowers, herbs, &amp; sweets. which in her gard? grode. But now, the names of them, I purpose to descrie: In steede of Fenell, Syr, the first is Flatterie, The other Herbe is Sawsinesse, in steede of Sauourie: In steede of Basell, now there lyeth Brauerie: And for sweete Southernwood, againe, is secret Slauerie: In steede of Isop, now, there lies Inuention: And in the steede of Camamill, there lies Confusion: The Flowers now are these: in steede of Iylliflowers, Fayre Iestes: that last not sweete, alas, aboue two or three houres. For Roses, Rages: which wyll not so soone decay: For Paunseies, pretie Practises, that alter many a way: For Marygoldes, Mischiefe: for Walflowers, Wantonnesse: For Pinckes, Presumption: for Buttons, Businesse: For Daysies, Doubtfulnesse: for Violets, Viciousnesse: For Primroses, Foolysh Pride: for Cowslips, Carelesnesse: With these flowers and Herbes, with many moe (God wot) Doth Fancie strow her Chamber floore, whiche I remember not. Now Syr, in this same roome, thus brauely bedect, Syts Fancie in her brauerie: and Syr, in eache respect, So serued in her kinde, with her fine Chamberlayne, That not for any thyng she hath, that she needes to take payne. Fine Curiositie, her Chamberlaine, doth all The seruice in her Chamber, Syr: but the Vsher in the Hall He doth her seruice too, although not all so neere Her person, as her Chamberlayne: she houldeth him more deere. The order how she sittes, is this Syr, in a Chayre, Fine carued out with Caruers worke, and couerd, verie faire, With a strange kind of stuffe: the colour is all green: Braue fringde and hang'd, with two fine Pearles, the like but seldom seen: Now Syr, her Chayre (in deede) is but a Youthfull brayne, Whose head is verie greene, in deed: the Frindge, to tell you plaine, Are Haires upon the head: the Pearles, they are the Eyes: Fast set vnto the head (good Syr,) and loe, thus in this wise, I shewe you Fancies seat: but if the eyes dyd see, What great dishonour tis to them, in Fancies Chaire to bee: They rather would fall off, then hang in such a place, Where they are ruld, when they mought rule, and so to gayne disgrace. But be they as they be, I shewe you as they be: Beleeue me, when that you come there, then you your self shall see. Well Sir, thus Fancie sits, before whom you must stand, Tyll she her selfe do bid you come, and take you by the hande: And that she soone wyll doo, for she is curteous; And where she takes a likyng too, she is as amorous. Now, beyng come to you, these wordes first she wyll say, She wyll be askyng, how at first, you thither found the way? Wherto, your Answere made, then she wyll take the payne, To shewe you all her roomes within, and shee wyll entertayne You in so braue a sorte, that you shall thinke, a while, You are in heauen: with sugred speeche she wyll you so beguile. Now, first, she leades you in, into her Garden gay: She shews you flowers, but tels you not, how soone they wil decay: Shee telles you this braue tree, a gallant fruict wyll beare, This is a gallant Princely Plum, and this as braue a Peare: This is a Pippyn right, this is a Philbeard fine, This is a Damson delicate: but fewe suche fruictes as mine: When God, he knowes, the Tree whose fruictes she bragges on so, Is but a plant of peeuishnes, and brynges foorth fruits of woe. Her Plum is but a Pate, that puffed is with pryde: Which eyther quickly rotten growes, or breakes out on som side: Her Peare is an olde plant, that bringeth Outwarde ioye To sight, at least: but, eaten once, wyll choake you with annoy. Her Pippyn is a Crabbe, that growes in Sainct Iohns wood: Which makes a shewe of a faire fruict, but in taste is not good. This is a secreate foe, that seemes a faythfull frende, But wyll be sure, who trust in him, to faile hym in the ende. Her Fylberds haue faire shales, but Kernelles all are gone, Her Damsons are deceiptfull fruicts, as hard as any stone: Harde: how?—not hard in hand, nor very hard in taste, But beyng swallowd, very hard for to digest at last. These Trees, with many mo which I not call to mynde, In Fancies gallant Garden plot you shalbe sure to finde. Now in this Gardein, more alas, I had forgot: About the midst therof (I gesse) there standes a prety plot, Wherin is made a Maze, all bordered with Wilde breere, Set all about the bankes with Rue, that grew there many a yere. Just in the midst wherof, a huge high Mount dooth stand, Which grew by nature in y? place, not made by Gardeners hand: The hill on the one side, is made much lyke a Hart, And as like to a Hed againe vpon the other part. And in this Mount, there dwels a number of mad men: Some mad in hart and some in hed, and euery one his den. Upon the Hart side, stands the cave of crueltie, A currish knaue, which with his teeth, still gnashing, close doth lie. By him hath foule Despight a fylthy Den lykewise, Which, in that lothsome lodge of his, Still fretting, dayly lyes. By him horrible Hate, hath eke a kinde of Caue, Like a foule hole: but good inough for such a filthy slaue: Upon the hedside now, lies Melancoly first, Hee beates his head with studie so, as if his braines would burst. By him vile Enuy next, foule fiend, with fierie eyes, Bound about hed w? Serpent skinnes, in lothsome manner lies. Right ouer him dooth keepe fierce Frenzie, in his caue: Hee frets, hee fumes, he stampes and stares, &amp; neuer lins to raue. Aboue them all, vpon the top of this same hill, Dwels Madnes, Maister of them all, and with him, witles Will: His lodge is like a house, that had bin built of stone, That had bin ouerthrowne, &amp; nought left but the walles alone: It hath a kinde of roofe, but all vncouered: So that the raine vpon him falles, as hee lies in his bed: And for the manner now how he lies, credit mee, It is the straungest sight mee thinkes, that euer I did see. His Bedsteed is of Wood, ingrauen with Vgly faces: And standes more halfe a sunder, burst in twenty sundry places: His Bed with fethers stuft, but all the Downe flowne out: And those y? bide, are stubborne quilles, y? prick him round about. Upon an olde crackt Forme, by his Bedside, there lies Ould instruments of Musicks sound, all broke in wondrous wise. A Lute, with but thre strings, and all the pinnes neere out: The belly crakt, the back quite burst, and riuen round about. His Virginals, with neuer a iack, and [but] halfe the keyes: His Organes, with the bellowes burst, and battred many waies. His Fife, three holes in one: his Harpe, with neare a string: Great pittie, trust me, for to see, so broken euery thing. A Pen and Inke he hath, and Paper too hard by, But paper quite in peeces torne, pen burst, and Inkhorne drie. He feedes of Fancies fruites, that in her Garden growe, He drinks of Drugs of foule Despight, a beastly broth I trow. He feares no heat nor colde, for if with heate he glow, The waues of wo wil coole him streight, y? there by tides do flow. For through this Forrest runnes, the Seas of sorrow sore: Whose Waues do beate against this Fort, that bordereth on the shore. And if with colde he quake, the heate of raging ire Will quickly warme him so, that he shall neede none other fire. In raging Frantick fittes, he passeth foorth the day In straunge perplexities, himselfe tormenting many a way. Among many mad toyes, I saw him play one parte, With looke full fierce I saw him holde, a Dagger to his Hart, Redie to kill himselfe. and with his heare vpright, He cryed, he would rather die, then bide sutche deepe dispight: At which same crie of his, me thought that euery one Within their Caues, all sodeinly did make a piteous mone: With which amazed halfe, not knowing what to say, By helpe of God, I know not how, but straight I got away. And then I was againe with Fancie, by and by, Out of the Maze in her Gardeine: who led me presently, As she will you likewise, if you will: backe againe Into her house: where you will thinke in heauen for to remaine. The Entrie first, before you come vnto the Hall, Is set out gallantly with toyes, and that of cost not small. The Pauements are of stone, which Hard harts haue to name: They grow all in a minde of man, and thence she hath the same: About the Entrie walles, doo hang devises straunge: And, by the brauerie of the same, much like the Low Exchange. From Entrie then you come streight way vnto the Hall; And that with manie Jewels riche is hanged round withall. The roome it selfe is long, and therewith somewhat wide, And for the fashion, in my minde, not much unlike Cheapeside: There hang great store of gaudes, of which the Vsher straight, Dooth offer to Dame Fancies eie. and therfore there dooth waight, Chaines, Jewels, Cups, &amp; pots: Pearles, precious stones, &amp; Rings, Fine whistels, Corals, Buttons, Beads, &amp; such like costly things: Fine Brooches for your Hat, fine Aglets for your Cap, Fine Tablets for a gallant Dame, to hang before her lap. These things, with many mo, in this same Cheapeside Hall, Hath Vaine delight, to please Fancie, his Mistris minde withall. Now though she see them all, her Chamberlain must chuse What he best thinkes will like her minde, &amp; what she wil refuse. That Chamberlaine (you know) is Curiositie: He euer chooseth all the ware, that Fancie fond dooth buye. Now from the Hall, vnto the Parlor straight you go, Which, as the Hall, with Jewels riche, is brauely hanged so: The roome is long, not large, I met it not with feete: But, as I gesse, in fashion tis, much like to Lombarde streete: This roome the Vsher too, dooth looke too, with the Hall: Well, there within a little while you quickly will see all: Which, beeing seene, you passe into the other roome, Which called is her Counting house: wherin when you be come, There shall you see her bookes, that treates of many toyes, And most of them doo show the cause of louers greefes or ioyes. Some volumes Syr, doo treate of naught but Vanitate, But very few that speakes a worde of perfect Sanitate. Some auncient Authors write De arte amandi: Which who so studies throughly, runs mad or ere he die: And, in the steede of Tullies workes, written De officijs, There standes Tom tatlers treatise, Syr, De fine Brandicijs: Among the rest are some, Belle discorce d'amore, And some doo write discourses De graundissimo dolore: Some bookes doo make discourse of Pride and Foule disdaine, Some letters Amatorie are: some of Despite againe. Some Pretie Pamphlets are, some Posies, Satirs some: Some doo discourse of Falconrie, and some of Day of Doome; And they are called Drummes: and some tell pretie tales Of Lapwings, Swallowes, Fesant cocks, &amp; noble Nightingales: Some Songes and Sonets are, and some are Louers layes: Some Poets paint The pangs of loue, a thousand sundry waies. Now with such bookes as these, with other such like toyes, Dooth Fancie store her Counting house, for to instruct her boyes, And girles too, now and than: at least, if they doo reede: And in such vaine Discourses, most her selfe delights indeede. Now Syr, when you haue seene her fine Librarie there: She shewes you then her other roomes, &amp; leades you euery where. But sure her Counting house, of all that ere I see, Is built as like to Poules Church yarde, as euer it may bee. Now next she leades you too her Wardrope of fine cloth, Of diuers kindes of colours Syr: what, laugh you Syr, of trothe? Beleeue mee, when that you to Fancies Forte doo go: And if you come into her Courte, then you shall finde it so. The colours of her cloath are faire and verie gay: White, red, blewe, greene, Cernation, Yelow and Popyniay: Of blackes, but very few: but other colours store Of mingled colours, or suche as I tolde you of before: Now, she that keepes that roume is a yonge pleasant Dame, And Wantonnesse I trow it be, that Fancie calles her name: Nowe Wantonnesse againe, shee keepes a pretie knaue, That euery day deviseth styll, newe fashions for to haue. He hath a knauish head, fine knackes for to inuent, Wherof good stoare of cloathe, in haste, in fashions may be spent: In gardes, in weltes, and iagges, in laying cloath upon cloath: And this same youth a Tailor is, for men and women bothe. His name is Fond deuise: he came of Apish race: A man, for such a mistris meete, and fit for such a place: But for Dame Fancie fine, no garments Syr, he makes: But first the view her Chamberlaine Curiositie takes: And if he like it well, then will she stand content: If not, his labour all is lost, and cost in vaine is spent. Now this same Wardrop Syr, is likest, in my minde, To Watling streete, of any place, that euer I could finde. Now Syr, from thence you come: when you haue seene all there, You go into her Gallarie, a roome that I dare sweare, The like is seldome seene for gallant setting out: If one should trauaile euerie day, almost the world about, For choice of Gallant stuffe, and fine deuises strainge: No place so like, that ere I see, as is The high Exchange: Such purses, gloues, and pointes, of cost and fashion rare, Such cutworks, partlets, sutes of lawne, bongraces, &amp; such ware: Such gorgets, sleeues, and ruffes, linings for gownes, and calles, Coiffes, crippins, cornets, billaments, muske boxes &amp; sweet balles, Pincases, picktoothes, bearde brushes, comes, needels, glasses, belles, And manie such like toies as these: that Gaine to Fancie sels. But yet, of all these toyes, not one will Fancie buye, Except they first be looked on by Curiositie: But Follie, manie times, standes at his elbow so, That makes him choose the worse sometime, and let the better go: Well, there not longe you bide, but downe you come againe Into the Hall beneath good Syr, where longe you not remaine: But to the Kitchin streight, she forthwith leadeth thee: Where, how she dresseth all her meate, the order thou shalt see. And what kinde cookes she hath, and how they make their fyre To roast, to seeth, to broile, to bake, and what you will desire: The roome is narow syr, in which a Harth, all bare, On which the Cook powers on his coales, &amp; kindels th? with care: Then layes he to the Spit, if any meate be roast: And if the fyre be once a flame, then it beginnes to toast. The meate that most he roastes, for Fancies daintie toothe, Are Partridges, larkes, plouers greene, &amp; such fine foule (for sooth). The Coles are made of stickes, of stuborne youth (God wot) Which kindle quicklie of themselues, and blowing needeth not: The kinde of woode is Will, drie, without Sapience sappe: The lobcoke Lust, from thriftlesse thick, both bring th? in his lap: Which wood with lying still, is growne so verie drie, That with a Sparke of Sporte, alasse, they kindle, by and by. The Cooke is Carelesse calde: the fowles he roastes, are these: For Larks, are looks; for Plouers, thoughts: for Partridge, Practises: The Larkes are Lookes: which when they liue, doe flie: But beeing stroken dead, they serue for Fancie, by and by: The Partridge, Practises: which, liuing, seeme so good, That they are put vnto the fyre to serue for Fancies foode: For as the Partridge keepes her selfe close to the grounde, Because, by colour of her coate, she may not so be founde: So Practises, that shift, to keepe themselues vnseene, Are Foules most fit for Fancies tooth: and now, for Plouers greene, Greene thoughts, that flie about: now here, now there againe: But if, by chaunce, by Cupids dart, they hap for to be slaine. Then lying but a while, at this same flaming fire, They make in deede a meate, that most fond Fancie doth desire. Now hauing seene all this, then shall you see, hard by, The Pastrie, Mealehouse, and the roome, wheras the Coales do ly: The Coalehouse is a Caue of care and miserie: The Pastrie, is a Place of open patcherie: The Mealehouse, is a Place, with set mischiefe fraught, For sure, the meale is made of corne, y? is much worse then naught. The Corne is called Rye: and diuers kindes there bee Of this same Rye: as you your self, when you are there shall see. For there is one kinde Rye, is called Knauerie: Another, Flatterie, with Tretcherie, and Patcherie: An other Trumperie, an other Mockerie, And Baudrie too: and yet the best is but a kinde of Rye, Wherof the Meale is made, that maketh Fancies bread: And that is baked in the braine, of a hot foolysh head: The Graine is sowne by sundrie slaues: of which one, Beastlinesse, The other Secrete sawcinesse: another Trayterousnesse: An other Peeuishnesse, and another Wilfulnesse, With Lowtishnesse, and many moe, which I can not expresse: And reaped by suche slaues, to Fancie, slaues, in deede, Which bring the Corne into the Barne of Beggerie, with speede: They now, that thresh the Corne are two stronge sturdie knaues, Who haue great beetles in their hands, in steed of thrasshing staues: Of whome to tell the names: first, Lobcocke, little wit, And wayward Wyl: a good t?gh knaue: he stands, his fellowes sit: They with their Beetels in their hands, or heades, at least, Doo make it readie for the Myll: then he that grindes the griest, Is Many better sir, an arrant craftie knaue: Who, with his toulyng, wyll be sure, a good round gaine to haue. Now sir, this Myll doth stand, vpon an Hyll on hie, Whose Sayles are driuen by blastes of winde, &amp; so grind merely: Now Syr, the Corne thus grounde: to Fancies Fort, streight way, The Myller coms, and in the house, there down his Meale doth lay: Now Syr, when you haue ben in all those Offices, And that at Fancies handes, you finde suche loue and gentlenesse, To shewe you all her House: but soft, I had forgot To speake of her Bedchamber fine, which now sir, I wyll not Let slippe, for any thing: the Roome it selfe is rounde, And in the night dooth stand hir Bed, with Curtens brauely bo?d. The Walles hangde all with Hope, on thone side verie faire: Vpon the other side againe, darke hangings of dispaire. Strange pictures by hir Bed: on thone side, fittes of greefe, On thother side, to euerie pange, a present sweete releefe. Upon the one side, sweete accorde, on thother Dire debate, Vpon the one side, Naked loue: on thother, Couerd hate. On thone side, Prodigies, with pleasaunt Dames in ioye, On thother side, Chauing Peascods: in greefe and great annoye. These diuers contraries, with many thousands mo, When Fancie gazeth on a while, she is amazed so, That musing so a while, she slumbreth at the last, And beeing in a slumber so, she sleepeth, but not fast: Her Bed is all of Downe, whereon she lies so soft, As any Ladie in this land: and at her Bed a loft, Are written in faire hande, and easie for to reede: (Although I seeme a louelie dame, I lothsome am in deede) This solempne sentence, Who euer so dooth see, And dooth consider the contents, will neuer like of me. Her Bed is thus bedeckte: the Curteynes are of Saye, Not greene, nor yealow, red nor blew, nor white, nor popiniaye: No Silke, nor Cruel Saye: what then may be the same? This Say is calde, saye for thy selfe: lo, nowe you know the name. Her Couering, Curious cost: her Blankets, Louers blisse: Her Sheets are Shifts: to shroud her selfe. her quilts, are quidities: Her Pillowes, they are Points: that Louers leane vpon. Her Bolster, is a Beggar's Bagge: when coine and goods are gone. Her Bed she lyes vpon, is a yonge Mellowe braine: Where Fancie softlie lyes and sleepes, and neuer feeleth paine. And of such Beds, she hath such stoare of choise (by roode) That (if so be) she like not one, an other is as good. Of which, some are so softe, that she dooth like them so, That with her lying in them long, they more halfe rotten growe: And if they be not turned, or ere they go to farre, In time, both braine, and head, and al she wilbe sure to marre. Thus shall you see her Bed and Chamber, brauely deckte: And euery roome within her house, set out in each respect, So gallantlie: that as I saide, I saye againe, You sure will thinke (at first) a while, in heauen for to remaine. Thus, when that Fancie fine, hath led you rounde about Her statelie house, in everie roome: then shall you see a loute, Come with a napkin fine, about his body bound, Into the chamber, there where first Dame Fancie fine you found: He comes to laye a cloth, vpon Dame Fancies boorde: And then to bringe in all her cates: and trust me (at a worde) It is so strange a sighte, to see her seruéd so, As I shall neuer see the like, where euer so I go. Her Table is a Forme, that stands without a frame, And none but she and her compeeres, can sit vpon the same: Her Stooles, stande without feete, I cannot shew you how, Though I haue seene them (credite me) I haue forgot them now. But you shall see them there, if thither you will go. Now sir, when you are there, and see this order soo, Then unto Dinner straight, she goeth by and by: There shall you see her fine Compeeres, that beare her companie. First, vpper most she sittes, in a great maiestie: Then sits there downe by her, a Dame called Ladie vanitie. Then downe sits her Compeeres, Follie and Frenzie both: Such companie, as for to keepe, a wiseman would be lothe. Her Waitors at her borde, are Curiositie, Her Chamberlaine; and next to him stands Carefulnesse hard by: The Cooke that drest the meate: then Nodcoke naturall, Then Iacke-an-apes and busie Bee, worst manered of them all: Thus furnisht is this boorde, with waitors in such sorte: The meates whereof she feedeth most, I neede not make report: I spake of them before: but for her kinde of drinke, No beere, nor ale, nor wine it is: and what then doo you thinke? It is a drinke composde, of drugges of diuers sortes, Discourtesie, Disdaine, Dispigh: and mingled with Disportes, Sappe of faire Semblaunce, with secret Simulation. With Ioice of herbes of hollow hartes. and faithfull protestation: These Drugges, with many mo, puts Fancie in her drinke: Which though they sumwhat please the tast, yet make the bosom stinke: And workes so in their heads, that are not used theretoo, That maks them more half mad: for greif, they know not what to do. Now syr, this is her drinke: her meate before you know: Her servaunts I haue showne you too, that do attend her so. Now Syr, when you haue fed, of Fancies fare one day: I doo beleeue that you will wishe, your selfe, next day away. I promise you (of troth) I did when I was there: And I would not be there againe, for twentie pound, I sweare. And more then wishing too, at borde aloude I cride: I would I were away, this fare, I cannot I abide. Which when that Fancie sawe, she tooke me from the boorde, And thrust me out of dores in haste, not speaking any worde. And flonge me downe the steares, wherewith I caught a fall, That greeued me sore: but yet (me thought) I stood c?tent withal. The vsher of the Hall, he tooke me by and by, And out of doores too in like sorte, he thrust me presently. Then euery Iacke-an-apes, that rid upon an Asse, Was ready for to ride me still, as I the Courte did passe. The Geese and Ganders hist, the Duckes cride quack, at mee: Thus euerie one would haue a flyrt, ere I could get out free. The Porter Daliaunce, he draue me out in haste, And thrust me downe so hard the Hill, my neck was almost brast. And vp I rose againe, though bruséd verie sore, And ment, if once I gat away, for to come there no more. Well, limping as I coulde, I hit the beaten waye, Of fooles foote steps: through Forrest back, that led me so astraye. And back againe I came, to Learning's narrow lane: And there I hit The trackt of Truth, that I should first haue tane, That leaues the Forrest quite: which when I had hit on, I staide awhile, and there my walke I gan to thinke vpon: And thinking so, I saw a Scholler comming by, That came from learnéd Vertue's Schoole: and, sighing heauely, I calde him vnto me, and tolde him of my wo, Of my sore fall, from Fancies Forte, and how I caught it so. Which when that he had harde, he tooke me by the hande, And beeing verie weake (in deede) scarse able for to stande: He led me to a house of Wisdome: an olde man, His Father (as he saide) he was: and there I rested than. This Jentle youth, if I do not forget the same, Is Honest Reason: so I thinke, his Father cald his name. Where, beyng but a while, my tale I gan to tell To hym, of this my gentle walke: wherat he laughéd well, And laughing so (quoth he) go, Youth, here take a booke, And write now, for rem?brance thine, y? when thou chance to looke Upon the same againe, then thou mayst take heede styll, Of leauyng Wisdome's narrow Lane, and follow wanton wyll: Loe, thus at his commaund, I wrote it by and by: And this it was, beleeue me now, or els (at least) I lye. FINIS. In Dispight of Fancie. Ah, feeble Fancie, now thy force is nothing worth: Thou hadst me in thy Castel once, but now I am got forth: Thou barst a gallant flagge of lustie brauerie, But I haue seene y? all thy showe, is but meere knauerie. Thy Fethers flaunt a flaunte, are blowne awaie with winde, And Falshood is the trustie Troth, that one in thee shall finde. Thy valure is but vauntes, thy weapons are but wordes: Thou vsest Shales, in steede of Shot, and signes in steede [of] swords. Thy Forte is of no force, each foole maie scale the same, And thou thy selfe art but a flirt, and not a noble Dame, As some doo thee accompt: I know thee too too well, And none but Dawes &amp; Doltes, within thy foolish Forte do dwell. Thy Castell is, in deede, a Caue of miserie, A place in short space for to bring a man to beggerie. Thy Forte defended is, by Duckes and gardes of Geese, By Iacke an Apes, Asses too, and such gallants as these. Thy deepe delight is all in foolish trifling toyes: Thou makest a man in things of nought, to set his cheefest ioyes. Thy Schoole maie well be called, the Schoole of littell skill, Thy Schoolers most are waywarde wits, that follow wanton wil: Thy Lessons lothsome are, thy selfe a Mistris too, Of naught but Mischeefe, which thou most doost make thy Schollers doo. Thy Pleasure breeds Man's paine, thy Game doth turne to Greefe: Thou woorkest many Deadly woe, but few doost lend releefe. Thou makest a man to gaine Dishonor and Defame, Thou makst him thinke a Stinking Slut to bee a Gallant dame. Thou makes him Hang on hope, and drowne in Deepe dispaire: Thou makest him, like a mome, to build High Castels in the aire. Thou makest him thinke Black White, &amp; when that all is known, Thou makest him Like an Asse, to se a fooles head of his owne. Thou art The cause of care, but comfort very small, And so, what euer is amisse, thou art the cause of all: My selfe haue seene all this that I report, and more: Thou madest me thinke y? did mee good, that greeuéd me ful sore. But long I was so blinde, thou so hadst dimd my sight, That I could neuer see the craft of this thy deepe dispight: Till I out of thy Forte, was clerely got away, And came to Graue aduises house, where now I hope to stay. Where when I was arriued, by helpe of a deere frende: Trew reason: one with whom I meane, to keepe till life do ende. Now when that I came there, he did declare to me, What ment that foolish Forte of thine, and all that I did se: Which when I well had markt, I did not all repent My labour in my Journey so, although my cost I spent. Because thy nature so, and deeds I did discrie: Which deeds of thine, I doo detest, and thee I doo defie. And now unto the worlde, in deepe despight of thee, I shew what a vaine flirte thou art, that euery man may see. I haue set out thy Forte, thy Force, and eke thy Schoole: Thy Vshers too, that teach therein, a mad man and a foole: Thy lothsom lessons too, and how, by great good happe, I am got out, although long first, out of thy lothsome lappe. What shall I farther say, I haue set out, in kinde: Eche peeuish poynt I know in thee, for euery man to finde. Therefore, let fall thy flagge, and all thy brauerie; I haue at large, I thinke, set out thy suttill slauerie: And that, in such a sort, as who so lust to reade, My whole discourse of thy dispight, will learne for to take heede. Of all thy gallant showe, they know now what it is: Thou long hast liued unknowen, alas, but now descride, I wis. And for my selfe, thy Forte I know so well, I sweare, That I doo meane to keepe mee thence, and neuer to come there: But if I doo looke vp, and follow thee againe: Then keepe mee fast within the Forte, and plague me for my paine. But trust me, I meane it not: with Reason here, my frend, I meane to lyue in thy dispight, and so I make an ende. And yet before I make a flat ende, ere I go, I wyll discharge my stomache quite, and byd thee farewell so. FINIS. A Foole, Dame Fancies man, speaketh in Defence of his Mistresse, Fancie. What meanes that mad man, tro, that railes on Fancie so? That seekes to do her such dispight, &amp; sweres himself her fo: The man mistakes himselfe, it is not Fancie, sure, That for to fal into such rage, doth him so much procure. Why, Fancie, is a frende, to euery curteous Knight: Why, Fancie, is the chiefest thing, that doth the minde delight. Why, Fancie, was the cause, that wunders first were founde: Of many fine deuices strange, first, Fancie was the ground: Why, Fancie is the thing, that mooueth men to loue, And telles the Louers what to doo, as best for their behooue: Fancie, findes pretie toyes, to please each Courtly Dame: Fancie, to passe the time in sporte, inuented many a game. To Courtiers many a one, a good frende Fancie standes: She makes them reap good lyking, at their louing Ladies' hands: She made the Poets olde, deuices to endight, Which they in wrightyng, left behind, for other men's delight. She seeketh vnto none, but many seeke to her: And those who are her servaunts styll, she seeketh to preferre To high degree in time: and that in Court (perchaunce) She helpeth them, and many wayes, doth seeke them to advaunce. Now some (perhaps) againe, that are of grosest wit, And, by their dispositions, For Follye Schollers fit: Those now (perhaps) in deede, she letteth all alone, With Follie, onely, to rewarde, and them regardeth none. But those that are againe, of quicke capacitie, Who can consider Vertue wise, from foolysh Vanytie: Suche men she chieflie loues, and suche, although they know her, Shall haue smal cause, in tract of time, in deed, for to beshrow her. I may not speake too muche, for I am partiall, But what I haue said is true, for I have tried all. And therfore, sure the man, that rayleth on her so, Hath done her wrong, without iust cause, to stand so much her fo. Faire wordes are euer best, backbiting is too bad. And therfore, I doo thinke the man, is either dronke or mad, That seekes her suche despight, so much without desarte: And, by her countenance, it seemes, it greeues her to the hart To be so muche abusde: but wot you what, no remedie: A wicked tongue doth say amisse. and will do tyll I die. FINIS. The Lamentacion of Fancie. Alas, poore seelie wretche, now maiste thou weepe and wayle: For now, thy Forte is of no force, thou canst no more preuayle. Fancie, let fall thy flagge, thy brauerie is descride, Thy shifts are seene, wherwith thou thoughtst, thy selfe from sight to hide. The man is got away, whom late I entertainde: And loe, by him I am defamde, and all my state is staind: Why did I not him feede, with some more sweete repaste? Why dyd I not deuise to dresse, some toy, to please his taste? I put into his drinke, too much Drugges of despight: Thou moughtst allayd the bitternes, with drams of sweet delight. Why didst thou, in a rage, first fling him from thy lap, And leaue to feede him any more, with Worldly pleasures pap? Why did I, in my rage, not speakyng any worde, Take him so roughly at the first, and set him from my boorde? And thrust him out of Doores, in such a scornfull wise: Thou hadst ben better let him dinde and let himself to rise. Why didst thou throw him downe the Steares in such a sorte? That he of thy discurtesie may iustly make report: And beeing falne downe so, why didst thou, Vaine delight, Thrust him out of doores by force, in such dispight? You, Jacke an Apeses too, why caught you at him so? To ride him like an Asse, as he along the Courte did go? Why did you hisse, you geese? and Duckes, why cride you quacke, To raile on him? why did you not more gently let him packe? Why didst thou, Daliaunce, so thrust him out of doore? That made him catch so great a fall and bruze himself so sore. Alas, what blame I you? my selfe I ought to blame: For, if I had forbidden it, you had not done the same: Coulde none of all my Flowers, so faire and sweete of smell, Cause him to haue desire, againe within my Forte to dwell? Coulde not my Bedchamber, with all my Pictures faire, Make him yet ere he die againe, thither to make repaire? Alasse, I feare he sawe the words at my Beds head: And, out of doubt, I feare in deede, that sentence he hath read: And that hath causéd him to lothe my Bed and me: But could not all the other sights, that in the Chamber he Did see, to mooue delight, make him forget the same? Oh no, well Fancie, yet seeke none at all to blame, But euon thy onely selfe, who tookste so small regarde Vnto a Stranger in such sorte, and handle him so harde. Well, since that he is gone, and that I am discride; And that from him my shiftes, alasse, I can no longer hide: I must a warning take, the next that come againe Vnto my Forte, for seruice mine, better to entertaine. And though he thus be gone, I doubt not but there be, Some youthes abroade yet in the worlde, y? wil come seeke out me: But all that I can euer haue, to ease my paine, Will neuer doe me halfe that good as to see him againe: Which if I euer haue, I now not sorrow so, But I shall then reioyce asmuch, and ridde me of my wo. Untill which time, alasse, I languish still in paine, And so shall doo, vntill I see, my gentle youth againe. FINIS. A FAREWELL To Fancie. Fonde Fancie, now farewell, thy Lodging likes me not: I serued thee long, full like a slaue, yet little gaines I got. Yet though I say my selfe, no slaue that euer seru'de Of any Mistris in this world, haue more rewarde deseru'd. But he that bindes himselfe apprentise to a Patch, At seauen yeares ende, will this be sure, to gain sum foolish catch. So Nodcoke I, that longe haue serued thee like a slaue; For my rewarde, by dew desart, Repentaunce gainéd haue. Thou never badst me go, but I would runne with speede: If thou didst bid me staie againe, two biddings should not neede. When I had better runne, when thou didst bid me staie, And better staide then goe on foote, to breede mine owne decaye. When thou didst bid me looke, I readie was to marke, And would not loose the thing so soone, no, not in greatest darke. When better I had beene, for to have shut mine eye, Then for to cast mine eye on that, should worke me woe thereby. When thou didst bid me like, I loouéd, by and by: When thou againe badst me mislike, I hated contrarie. What shall I further say, thou nothing badst me doe, But I was willing, by and by, for to agree thereto. But what, for all my paines haue I now reapt in fine, A goodly gaine, Repentaunce sore, of such great follie mine: When thou didst bid me go, my running made me fall: When thou didst bid me stay againe, twas for no good at all. Thou madste me studie ofte, but what?—fonde trifling toyes: The Arte of Loue, and of the cause of louers greefes and ioyes. Thou madste me think, long while, that louers greefe was game, And that no ioye could be compard, vnto a gallant Dame. Thou madst me thinke long time, no pleasure like to that, With Curtisans, in their kinde, to doe, I say not what. Thou madste me halfe amazde, sometime, with frantick fits, And, now and then with thoughts of loue almost out of my wits. Thou maadst me take delight, in Lodge of Loue to dwell: And for to coumpt that thing a heauen, which rather was a hell. Thou maadst me thinke that Loue did purchase heauenly Joy: Which now I see did purchase paine, &amp; wrought naught but annoy. Thou maadst me take delight to iet in braue attire: Which now I finde was more, indeede, than reason did require. In Fethers flaunt a flaunt, and tossing in the winde, Thou maadst me take delight, which now a folly great I finde. Thou maadst me take delight in singularitie, In Tailors worke to haue a tricke, that none should haue but I. Thou maadst me coumpt a praise, some fashion to deuise, Wherewith I sought in wisemens sight, my selfe for to disguise. Thou maadst me spend my time, in vaine and foolish toyes, And euer didst withdraw my minde, from seeking perfect ioyes. Thou maadst me thinke it was a heauen, For to go gaye, But neuer badst me looke in time, how long it would hould way. In fine, as long as I was Scholler at thy Schoole: For all the learning that I got, I proou'd my selfe a foole. Thou didst withdraw my minde from Perfect pietie, And maadst me cheefely to delight in worldly vanitie. But now, since that I see, that it hath pleaséd God, To plague me well for my desarts, with smart of mine owne rod: And giue me grace to finde, what greefes by thee doe grow, And that, although vnto my cost, thy nature naught I know. What gaines by thee are got, what pinching penurie, What greef of minde, what plague of purse, what wretched misery: I now forsake thee quite, and neuer meane to dwell, Neere thee, by fifteene thousand mile: and so, Fancie farewell. FINIS. The Toyes of an Idle head: verye pleasaunte and delectable, to passe away idle time withall. THE PREFACE. This preface, omitted from the edition used here (1582), has been interpolated from the 1577 edition. My friend, who so thou bee, that faine wouldst buy this booke, To passe away the time thereon, in ydle times to looke: If so thou fyndste that like thee not, yet pardon graunt to mee, And wish me from thy harte no worse, then I wish vnto thee. Against my will it shall be much, if many I offende With these rude rymes which I haue made vnto none other ende, But as I sayde before, for want of other glee, For pleasaunt heads to looke vpon, when they at leysure bee. But some there are, I must confesse, gainst whom in great despight Some running rymes, which here you see, I chaunced to indight. But such I count my deadly foes: and such one if thou bee That buiest my boke, then take the same in deepe despight of thee. But if you be my friend, and take all in good parte That there you fynde: and thinke it is for want of better arte, Then here with right good will I offer it to thee, And doe but thanke me for my paynes, it is ynough for mee. Of troth I promise yee, tis not for want of will, That rudely thus in rymes I run, but want of better skill. For if that I had Ouid's pen, ech worde in printe to place, Or Homer's exercyse I had, to giue my verse a grace, Or Tullie's Eloquence to talke, as I in minde thought best, Or Aristotle's pregnant wit, that passeth all the rest, Some prety peece of worke perhaps then moughtst thou fynde Among so many mery toyes, that mought content thy minde. But tush, my beetle brayne can no such fruictes bring forth; My verses are but rugged rimes, and therefore little worth. My head vnhooded yet, I ready am to flye At every little paltrye bird, that goeth whisking by. I neuer haue respect to any kinde of Game, Like to the hooded Hauke that, kepte a long while tame, When that he Game doth spring, she knowes it by the whurre, And then, to make a wing thereat, she ginnes of[f] fyst to sturre. But till the Game be sprong, on fyst she pearcheth still, But I (God wot) to choose my game haue no such kinde of skill. I stryke at what I may, and geue God thankes for all, And stande contented with the same, till better doth befall. And glad I am sometime to pray vpon a Byrde, I haue no wit to waye the best, but euery worthelesse worde I ready am in ryme to put, although my reason be But small (God wot), and that too small, as you may plainly see. But since you see my simple head vnhooded (as it is), Accept the symple fruict therof, and be content with this. Vntill I haue the skill to flye at better Game, Which when I kill, you shall be sure to taste some of the same. But if ye now disdayne these Byrdes, whereon I pray, With better game hereafter I perhaps will flye away. And lyke a very Churle, then will I parte with none, But feede vpon the best thereof vnto myself alone, Where few or none shall see, what foode I feede vpon, No, nor yet where I hyde the same, till all be spente and gone. Wherefore, my friende, I say, if so thou doest desyre More of my workes, and wouldst not haue the rest throwne in the fyre, Skorne not these ragged rymes, but rather soone amend, What so thou fyndst that likes thee not, and so I make an ende. Wishing thee well to fare, if so thou be my friend, But if my foe, then ill and worse, and so agayne I end. Finis. A pretty Dittie in despight of Fantasie. THE ARGUMENT. Since Fantasye fyrst mooued mee, To rime thus rudely, as you see: A prety Dittye of Despight, Gaynste Fantasy, first will I write. Now, by my troth, I cannot chuse but smile, To see the foolish fittes of Fantasie: With what deceits she dooth the mind beguile, As pleaseth best her great inconstancie. As well the wisest as the foolish man, She troubleth, I tell you, now and than. And no denyall: if she lyketh once, It must be had, what euer so it bee: And each day new Deuices for the nonce, Onely to please Mistresse fonde Fantasye. For she can neuer like one thing two dayes, Though it deserue neuer so great a praise. This thing to day, to morrow that againe, And yet the next day neither of them bothe: That now she likes, anon she will disdaine, And whom she louéd, seemeth now to loath. Thus chopping still, and chaunging euery day, With vaine delights, she leades the minde away. She makes the Louer thinke his Lady fayre, Although she be as foule as foule may bee: Shee makes him eke, build Castles in the ayre, And very farre in Milstones for to see. And in the ende, I thinke if all were knowne, Shee makes him see, a Fooles head of his owne. Shee makes my Lady so much to esteeme Of her greene pratling Parratte in the Cage: This makes her eke her little Page to deeme, The finest Boye in England, of his age: This makes her set more by her tame white Deare, Then some would doo by twenty pounds a yeare. And who can choose but laugh, to thinke vpon Such frowarde fittes of foolish fantasie? And how, alas, the minde is woe-begon, If that it hath not each thing, by and by, That she desires, whateuer so it be: Cost life or death, it must be had, we see. Shee feedes the minde of man with many a toye, Shee makes himselfe to seeke his owne decay; In thinges of nought, she makes him set his ioye, And from all Vertue leades him quite away. And shee it is, that vainely causéd me, Against her selfe to rime thus, as you see. FINIS. A dolorous Discourse, of one that was bewitched with loue. THE ARGUMENT. Since that the passing panges of looue, Which many Loouers ofte doo prooue: I fynde the cause, from time to time, That made men shew their mindes in rime. I doo intend, in verses few A dolorous discourse to shew, Of one that was bewitcht in looue: What passing pangues he ofte did prooue. In which, God wot, the more his paine, Euen till his death he did remaine. If I had skill to frame a cunning Vearse Wherein I mought my loathsome life lament, Or able were in rimes for to rehearse The gryping greefes, that now my heart haue hent: Such priuie panges of looue I could descrie, As neuer any Louer felt but I. Some say they freeze, they flame, they flie alofte, And yet they fall, they hope, and yet they feare: The feeld once wonne, yet ielousie full ofte With vile suspect, theyr yrkesome hearts dooth teare. They liue and lacke, they lack, and yet they haue, And hauing, yet they lack the thing they craue. They bide in blisse, amid their weary bale, With heauie hearts, they show a smiling face: In figures thus, they tell a mournefull tale, And set their sorrow out with such a grace, That who so reades the same, and markes it well, Would thinke a Louer's torments worse then Hell. Then thinke you, what vyle torments doo I feele, When all these pangues are but Flea-bytes to mine: I neuer came to top of Fortune's wheele, But vnnerneath, in dolours still doo pine: I neuer flew, whereby to haue a fall, Yet stoope I ofte, although my gate be small. Am I not then in case much worse then they That flye sometimes, although they fall as fast? Oh yes, my case let any Louer way, And they shall see, I neuer yet did taste One sugred ioye that they haue swallowed ofte, That flye and fall, although they fall not softe. For they that flie, although they catch a fall, Yet while they flie, the time so ioyfull is: The harme they take by falling is but small, For when vnto themselues they thinke on this, What a fyne flight, but euen ere while they had: For ioye thereof, they cannot long be sad. But Fortune neuer yet so fauoured mee, To lend me winges to take on little flight, Whereby the harme by falling I mought see, Or yet in flying fynde the deepe delight. I cannot call to minde one ioyefull day, Which, for a time, my sorrowes may allay. But lye along all weryed with this woe, And know not how to prooue to make a flight: With chilling colde, my ioyntes are frozen so, That when I striue but euen to stande vpright, I feele my feebled limbes to faint so fast, That staggering still, downe flat I fall at last. My harte it selfe, is bitten so with frost, That all my sences now are waxed nome: My tongue his taste of pleasaunt ioyes hath lost, My minde with cruell care is ouercome: My dazeled eyes are waxed dimme with teares, Which shew the state wherein my life it weares. Mine eares waxe deafe, no pleasaunt tunes they heare, That may reuiue with dole, my dulled braine: Where I was wonte with Musicke for to cheare My heauy heart, now seemes a deadly paine. For each sweete note I heere men play or sing, Thorough mine eare, like thunder clappes, dooth ring. But thus to liue, oh what a lyfe is this? To liue (alas) my sences all bestraught: Though straunge it seeme, yet trust me true it is, Such chilling cold my sences all hath caught, That I can neither heare, nor feele, nor see, Nor smell, nor taste, and yet aliue must bee. And shall I tell how fyrst I caught this colde? By looking long vpon thy louely face: For when I did thy heauenly hew behold, And markt therewith thy braue and comly grace: Good Lord, thought I, what worthy wight is this? Some heauenly Dame, then Venus sure it is. Venus, quoth I? with that I winckte for feare, And shut the windowes of my seeing shoppe: For greefe whereof my heart did swelte, I sweare: Then gan I striue against the hill to hoppe. With gazing eyes to stare on thee againe, Whose only lookes haue wrought me all this paine. But when I heard a name to thee assignde, And sawe thou werte an earthly Creature; Then gan I thus imagine, in my minde, Which waye mought I this Ladyes Loue procure, To me poore Page, that thus sore wounded lye At point of death: yet dying cannot die. But when I sawe mine owne vnworthinesse, And could not call to minde a due desarte: Whereon I mought presume, in this distresse, To craue of thee some salue for this my smarte: With greefe thereof, I caught this chilling colde, Which, quaking yet, my quiuering corps dooth holde. Yet lookte I, loe, and stared still on thee, Thinking thereby to finde some ease of paine: But straight, me thought, I sawe thee looke awrye, As who should say, thou didst my lookes disdaine. Which lowryng looke droue me into this fytte, Which God he knowes, how it torments me yet. But yet I must confesse at fyrst, deare dame, That whot desyre my greefe hath caused so: But, by and by, my fierce and fierie flame, Was quicklye quenchte with waues of wearie wo: In which wet waues, I too and fro am tost, Seeking in vaine, to finde some quiet cost. Now (noble Dame) since that thou seest plaine, How fyrst I caught this greefe that gripes my harte, And makes me thus to pine in pangues of paine: Since that in thee it lyes to ease my smarte, And only thee: (deare Dame) doe not denye To helpe me now, for if thou doest, I dye. But thinke vpon my bitter passion, And eke the passing pangues wherein I pyne: And how fast bound, without redemption, I lynger foorth this loathsome lyfe of mine: And how thou mayest with speede, if thee it please, Both set me free, and cure my straunge disease. Which if thou wilte, I know for certaynty Thou canst not choose, but lend me some releefe: Thou wilt, beholding my calamity, Lend some one graine of comfort to my greefe: Which when thou doest, for a Phisitions fee, A noble name thy greatest gayne shall bee. And so, deare Dame, when thou doest thinke vpon The lothsome lyues that Louers oft rehearse: Among the rest, let this of mine be one, Which here to thee dooth shewe itselfe in vearse: Then shalt thou see how farre my passyon, In pangues of loue, hath paste them euery one. [Now Christmas draweth near, &amp; most m? make good cheare] A Gentleman being on a Christmas Eue in a very sollitary place, among very solemn Company: where was but small cheare, lesse myrth and least musicke: beeing very earnestly entreated to sing a Christmas Caroll, with much adoe sung as followeth. Now Christmas draweth near, &amp; most m? make good cheare, With heigh how, care away: I lyke a siely mome, in drowsy dumpes at home, Will naught but fast and pray. Some syng and daunce for lyfe, some Carde and Dyce as ryfe, Some vse olde Christmas Games: But I, oh wretched wight, In dole both day and night Must dwell: the world so frames. In Court, what pretty toyes, what fyne and pleasaunt ioyes, To passe the tyme away: In countrey nought but care, sower Cheese curdes, chiefest fare, For Wyne, a Bole of Whay. For euery daintie dish, of Flesh or else of Fish, And for your Drinke in Courte: A dish of young fryed Froogges, Sodde houghes of mezled Hogges, A cuppe of small Tap worte. And for ech Courtly sight, ech shew that may delight The eye, or else the minde: In Countrey Thornes and brakes, and many miery lakes, Is all the good you finde. And for fine Enteries, Halles, Chambers, Galleryes, And Lodginges many moe: Here desert Wooddes or plaines, where no delight remaynes, To walke in too and froe. In Court, for to be shorte, for euery prety sporte, That may the heart delight: In Countrey many a greefe, and small or no releefe, To ayde the wounded wight. And in this Desarte place, I, Wretch, in wofull case, This merry Christmasse time: Content my selfe, perforce, to rest my carefull corse: And so I end my rime. [The Christmas now is past, and I haue kept my fast] In the latter end of Christmas, the same Gentleman was likewise desired to sing; and although against his will, was content to singe as followeth. The Christmas now is past, and I haue kept my fast, With prayer euery day: And like a Country Clowne, with nodding vp and downe, Haue past the time away. As for old Christmas Games, or daunsing with fine Dames, Or shewes, or prety playes: A solemne oath I sweare, I came not where they were, Not all these holy dayes. I did not sing one noate, except it were by roate, Still buzing like a Bee: To ease my heauy harte, of some, though little smarte, For want of other glee. And as for pleasaunt Wine, there was no drinke so fine, For to be tasted heere: Full simple was my fare, if that I should compare, The same to Christmas cheere. I sawe no kinde of sight, that might my minde delight, Beleeue me, noble Dame: But euery thing I saw, did freat at wo my maw, To thinke vpon the same. Upon some bushy balke, full faine I was to walke In Wooddes, from tree to tree, For wante of better roome: but since my fatall doome, Hath so appointed mee: I stoode therewith content, till Christmas full was spente, In hope that God will sende A better yet next yeare, my heauie heart to cheare: And so I make an ende. [What griping greefes, what pinching pangues of payne?] The same man beeing in very great dumpes the same time, beeing likewise intreated to write some dolefull Dittie of his owne inuention wrote as followeth. What griping greefes, what pinching pangues of payne? What deadly dinte, of deepe and darke annoye? What plague? what wo, dooth in this world remaine? What Hellish happe? what wante of worldly ioye? But that (oh Caytife) I do dayly bide, Yea, and that more then all the world beside. If euer man had cause to wish for death, To cut atwo this lucklesse lyne of life: Why striue not I, with speede to stoppe my breath? Since cruell care, not like a caruing knife, But like a Sawe, still hackling to and froe, Thus gnawes my heart, with gripes of weary woe. What, doo you thinke I iest, or that I faine? Or, Louer-like, my life I doo lament? Or that my fyttes are fancies of the braine, Which wauer still, and neuer stande content? Or that my sighes are nought but signes of sloath? Oh, thinke not so, beleeue me, on my troath. This I protest before my God on hie, If that I could my doloures well declare: I thinke I should such priuie pangues descrie Of sorrowes smarte, as surely seldome are Seene nowadayes: I thinke, especially: Yea, seene or felte, of such a Youth as I. But some perhaps will aske, what is my woe? What is the thing that makes me so to mourne? And why I walke so solemne too and froe? I aunswer thus: such fyry flames dooth burne Bothe day and night, within my boyling brest, That, God he knowes, I take but little rest. But shall I tell how fyrst this flame arose? And how these Coles were kindled at the furst? I may not so my dolloures deepe disclose: For credit me, I would faine, if I durst: But since, alas, I may not as I would, Let this suffice, I would faine, if I could. What if I could? nay, durst: what did I say? For if I durst, I know full well I could: What could I doe? no whit more then I may: I know that too: but yet, if that I would, I could doe much more then I meane to doe, As thus advisde: but whether doo I goe? What neede so many words, so much a doe? To blaze the broyles that I doe dayly byde: Or else to tell of tormentes too and fro, Wherewith I am beset on euery syde: These few wordes mought haue serued the tourne, I trowe: Ten thousand plagues, but pleasures none I knowe. A pretty gyrd, giuen by a Gentlewoman to her servaunt whereupon these Verses were made as followeth. Farewell Youth, to your vntruth. When as thou badst farewell to myne vntrueth, I hope thou spakest it but in iest, deare Dame: Or else, for that you thought that euery youth, Most commonly is touched with the same: Such youthes there are, I must confesse, in deede, As with vntrueth their Ladies fancies feede. But what of that: tush, I am none of those, Though youthly yeares, I cannot well denie: For rather lyfe then trueth, I chuse to lose: By trueth, I meane my true fidelitie: Which who so breakes, to him, as to a youth, Thou mayest well say: farewell to thine vntrueth. But yet, good Lady, say not so to mee, Till thou dooest see, my trueth by falshood staynd: Which when thou seest, then iustly spit at mee, As at a slaue, whose trueth is all but faynd: But till that time, say not to mine vntrueth Farewell againe, but onely to my youth. For all vntruethes I vtterly denye, And to my trusty trueth, I stoutly stand: And who so list against the same replye, Gainst him with speede, I goe, with sworde in hande: Into the Feeld, the same for to defend: For loe, in this my credit dooth depend. And though (perhaps) most commonly, each youth Is giuen in deede, to follow euery gaye: And some of these are touched with vntruth, Yet some there be, that take a better waye: And stande vpon their trueth and honesty, More then vppon their foolish brauerie. Which two I count to be the cheefest poinctes That ech man ought to builde his life vpon: And these holde I my cheefe and strongest joynctes: For what were I, when these two poinctes are gone? Wherefore, deare Dame, as I begon I end: My Youth I graunt, and trueth I still defend. [My freend, I saye, if thou be wise] It chaunced not long after, that this Gentleman happened to be in the company of his very friend, which at Dyce lost much money: and after his losse, entreated him to write some despightfull Ditty, to diswade him from Cards and Dice: which with much intreaty he graunted, &amp; wrote as followeth. My freend, I saye, if thou be wise, Use not to much the Cardes and Dyce: Least, setting all at sincke and syce, Doe make thee know the cost: Twill make thee weare a thinne light purse, Twill make thee sweare, and ban, and curse: Twill make thee doo all this and worse, When once thy Coyne is lost. Therefore, take heede in time, I say: For time at Dice runnes fast away, No time worse spent then at dyce-play, I put thee out of doubt: And say not, but it was thee tolde: The nearer that thy purse is polde, The more still friendship waxeth colde, Yea, all the worlde throughout. And then, when once thy coyne is gone, And friends to helpe thee thou hast none, Nor house nor Land to live vpon: Oh then, what wilt thou say? Well, once I might haue taken heede, I had a trusty freend in deede, That tould me true how I should speede, If I did hold this way. For who continues in this vaine Of setting still, bothe bye and mayne, But in the ende he shall be faine To leaue it, will or nill: And doe the thing that dooth despight Most men, though some it dooth delight, To them that play to holde the light, Full ill against their will. Leaue therefore (friend) while thou art well, And marke the woordes that I thee tell: If once thy lande thou fall to sell, Thy credit will impaire: And care not thou, though Gamsters say,— (These Gamsters, Roysters call I may) What, Dastard, darest thou not play? Howe, reach this man a Chaire. Well, if he bring it, sit thee downe, Or else go out into the towne: If not, then walke thee vp and downe, And beare a time his scoffe: And thou shalt see within a while, How thou mayest finely at him smile: When he would gladly wish a file, To file his yrons off. For commonly, such knaues as these Doe ende their lyves vpon three trees: Or lye in Prison for theyr fees, For all their bragging out: And though one yeare they goe full gaye, And euery day play lusty play: Yet with a Rope they make a fraye, Ere seuen yeare goe about. And therefore, say they what they list, Take thou still heede of, had I wist: And vse not too too much thy fist, To shaking of the Dice: For fyrst, thy gaine will be but small, The credit lesse, thou gettest with all: Thy estimation least of all, Though deare thou buy the price. Good Lorde, was not that man halfe madde, That once a prety lyuing had: And would not rest, but out must gadde, To Cardes and Dyce in haste: And vsed them so lustily, Setting, and throwing carelesly: Till in shorte space, full foolishly, He spent euen all, at laste. Euen so wilt thou, I promise thee, If thou doe not giue eare to me, And leaue thy trouling of a Dye, And that with speede, my friend: For they that vse so lustily The Cardes and Dyce, most commonly Are eyther brought to beggery, Or hang else in the ende. And now, farewell! since that I may, As now, no longer with thee stay: My counsaile, therefore, beare away, And leaue that vaine delight, That now thou hast in Cardes and Dyce: And learne betimes for to be wise: Once well warnde, is as good as twise: And so, my freend, good night. [To play at Dice is but good sporte] An other Dittie, after that, made by the same man (after a sorte) in defence of Cardes and Dice, as followeth. To play at Dice is but good sporte, So it be vsed in good sorte: But who delights in Cardes and Dyse, In deede, I cannot count him wise: For he that playes, till all be gone, With Robin Hoode and little John, May trace the Wooddes: for wise men say, Keepe somewhat till a rayny day. But will you, therefore, generally Disprayse the Dyce so spightfully? What thing so good, that now is vsde, But by a foole may be abusde? I speake not this vnto that ende, That you should thinke I would defend Dyce playing vniversallye, But onely used moderately. For who so long dooth vse the Dyce Till he thereof hath knowen the price: I meane, till almost all be gone: Then marke this, straight way, such a one, Beginnes to learne to cogge a pace: Whereby he dooth so much disgrace The Cardes and Dyce, that men doo feare To play, for Coggers euery where. But if that Coggers all were barde, And cleanly cutters of a Carde, And euery Gamster would play square: Then some men would hope well to fare. And then would few so much despise, As now they doe, both Cardes and Dyse: For neyther Cardes nor Dice be naught, If men would vse them as they ought. For how can Cardes or Dice hurt those, That care not whether they win or lose?— But who doe so? such men these are As play no more then they may spare: And when they come to any Game, They make a pastime of the same; But hab or nab, speede well who may, And merrily so will spend the day. And what is lost too, farewell it, Neuer chafe nor freate a whit. And they that vse play in this sorte, With Cardes and Dyce make preaty sporte. Then, therefore, since both Cardes and Dyce Be good for some men, as I say: Who dooth abuse them, is not wise, Nor worthy, in my minde to play. Therefore, as I begone, I ende, Moderate play I doe defend. [That I would not perswaded be] An other time, not long after, he chaunced to be in his friends and betters house: being in his bed about midnight, by chaunce awake, heard in the next chamber a Page of the Ladyes of the house, lamenting, as he laye in his bed, very sore his vnhappie estate: which as he could well beare away in the morning, put it in verse only for his owne reading, to laugh at: but being by his friend intreated, put it, as you see, among his Toyes (as one not the least), which was as followeth. That I would not perswaded be, in my yong rechlesse youth: By plaine experience I see, that now it prooueth truth: It is Toms song, my Ladyes Page, That seruice is no heritage. I hard him sing this other night, as he lay all alone: Was never Boie in such a plight, where should he make his mone? Oh Lord, quoth he, to be a Page, This seruice is none heritage. Mine Uncle told me tother day, that I must take great paine: And I must cast all sloath away, if I seeke ought to gaine: For sure, quoth he, a painefull Page Will make seruice an heritage. Yea sure, a great commoditie, if once Madame he doe displease: A cuffe on the eare, two or three he shall haue, smally for his ease. I would, for me he were a Page, For to possesse his heritage. I rubbe and brush almost all day, I make cleane many a coate: I seeke all honest meanes I may, how to come by a groate: I thinke I am a painefull Page, Yet I can make no heritage. Why? I to get haue much a doe a Kirtle now and than: For making cleane of many a shooe, for Ales, or Mistresse Anne. My Ladies Maides will wipe the Page, Alwayes of such an heritage. The w?ches they get Coifes and Cawles, Fr?chhoods &amp; partlets eeke: And I get naught but checks and brawles, a thousand in a weeke: These are rewardes meete for a Page, Surely a goodly heritage. My Ladies maides too, must I please, but chiefly mistresse Anne: For else, by the Masse, she will disease me vily, now and than. Faith, she will say, you whorson Page, Ile purchase you an heritage. And if she say so, by the roode, 'tis Cock I warrant it: But God he knowes, I were as good to be without[en] it. For all the gaines I get, poore Page, Is but a slender heritage. I haue so many folkes to please, and creepe and kneele vnto: That I shall neuer liue at ease, what euer so I doe: Ile therefore be no more a Page, But seeke some other heritage. But was there euer such a patch, to speake so lowde as I: Knowing what hold the Maides will catch, at euery fault they spie: And all for spight at me, poore Page, To purchase me an heritage. And if that they may heare of this, I were as good be hangde: My Lady shall know it, by Gis, and I shall sure be bangde: I shall be vsed like a Page, I shall not loose myne heritage. Well, yet I hope the time to see, when I may run as fast, For wandes for them, as they for me, ere many dayes be past: For when I am no longer Page, Ile give them vp mine heritage. Well, I a while must stand content, till better happe doo fall: With such pore state, as God hath sent, &amp; giue him thankes for all: Who wyll, I hope, send me, poore Page, Then this, some better heritage. With this, with hands and eyes lift vp to heauen on high: He sighed twise or thrise, and wepte to, piteously. Which when I saw, I wisht the Page In faith, some better heritage. And weeping thus, good God, quoth he, haue mercy on my soule: That ready I may be for thee, when that the bell dooth knoule: To make me free of this bondage, And partner of thine heritage. Lord, graunt me grace so thee to serue, that at the latter day: Although I can no good deserue, yet thou to me mayest say: Be thou now free, that werte a Page, And heere in heauen haue heritage. [Amid my ioyes, such greefe I fynde] The same man beeing desired the next day following, to singe some prety song to the Virginalles, by a Gentlewoman that he made no small accoumpt of: was faine, Extempore, to endite, and sing as followeth. Amid my ioyes, such greefe I fynde, That what to doo, I know not I: My pleasures are but blastes of winde: Full well euen now, and by and by Some sodaine panges torment me so, That I could euen crie out for wo. And yet perforce no remedy: Needes must I laugh when I could mourne: Yea, ofte I sing, when presently To teares my singing could I tourne. Such luck haue Gaimsters, some men say, Winne, and loose, and all in a day. But some there are, whom Fortune still Giues leaue to winne, and seldome lose: Oh, would to God, I had my will, That I might soone be one of those That are in Fortunes fauour so: Then neede I not thus playne of wo. For if that I were sure, at least, For to obtaine that I would craue; Yea, though it were but one request, I would desire no more to haue: I aske but euen one happy day, Let me doo after as I may. And sure I see no remedy, But euen to hope on happe alone: And that it is that comfortes me: For when hope fayles, all ioyes are gone. Therefore, what with hope and dispayre, My ioyes lye houering in the ayre. Which, would to God, would eyther fall, Or else be driuen quite away: That I might haue no hope at all, Or else that I might happily say: Now haue I found the thing I sought, Now will I take but little thought. Well, yet I hope, or ere I dye, To light on such a happy day: That I may sing full merrily, Not, heigh ho wele, but care away: The Ship, full many tempests past, Hath reacht the quiet Hauen at last. Finis. [What, shall I write some prety toy?] The next day after that he had written this passion of Loue, dyuers Gentlewomen being then in the house: he was intreted by two or three of them at once, to make some verses: and one among the rest, being very desirous to haue her request fulfilled, brought him a Pen, and ynke, and Paper: with earnest intreaty, to make some verses, upon what matter he thought best himselfe: he, very vnwilling to write, not knowing of a sodain, how to please them all in vearse, and yet desirous to graunt all their requests, with much adooe, was in the end intreated to write, as followeth. What, shall I write some prety toy? will that like Ladies best? Or shall I pen the praise of one faire Dame, abooue the rest? Or shall I write at randon else, what fyrst comes in my braine? No, no: for words once flowen abroade, can not be cald againe. Why then, since none of these will serue, what other kinde of stile, Shall I picke out to write upon?— now sure, I needes must smile, To thinke vpon my beetle brain, that can no fruite bring foorth: But such Baldictum rimes as these, as are not reading worth. Faith, Ladyes, but for shame, I would not write one word at all, In ryme (at least) because you see, my reason is so small. But since it is such as it is, indeede small and too small: I must desyre you, for this once, to stand content withall. And take the same in as good parte, as if a wiser man Had better done: because you see, I do the best I can. And more then can, you can not craue: for if you do of me, Before you aske, be sure to go without, I promise ye: But any thyng that well I can, commaund you all of me: And I wyll do the best I can, to please each one of ye: And thus, as humbly as I can, I craue of you to lend Your pacience to my rudenesse this: and so I make an ende. Full sory that I cannot write, so finely as I would, To like your fancies all alyke, for if I could I would: And so agayne, fayre Ladies all, in curteous sort I craue, As I deserue your favours so, and friendshyps, let me haue. [When Flatterie falles to play the fleeryng knaue] Not many dayes after, hee sawe a Gentlewoman in the house, whom he accounted his deere Mistresse, beginne to shew her euill countenaunce without cause, and to make very much of another, whom he thought very vnworthy of such good happe: and being not a little agreeued, to see himselfe cause-lesse to grow dayly so much out of countenaunce, and his adversary so vnworthy, esteemed: wrote one day among other, halfe a sheete of Paper in verse: wherein he priuily shewed his aduersaries unworthinesse, his Mistresses inconstancy, and his owne euill happe: and finding a fit time, deliuered the writing to his sayde Mistresse: which, how she tooke in worth, that restes: the verses were these. When Flatterie falles to play the fleeryng knaue, And tried trust is put out of conceight: And cogging craft by subtyll shiftes can haue The gaynes, for which doth faythfull seruice waight; Then deepe deceight must needes possesse the parte That doth in deede belong to due desarte. When fond suspect, shall cause a faythfull frende To deeme amisse of friend, without desart: And coy conceight, shall cause a finall ende Of friendshyp there, where friendes were linckt in hart: Then double dealyng, must of force preuaile To winne reward, and faythfull friendship faile. When men are scornde, and shadowes are esteemde, And shels are sau'd, and kernels cast away: And deedes be done, and woords for deedes be deemde, And outward brauery beares the bell away: Then honest meaning may go chaunge his minde, Or else is sure a colde rewarde to finde. But when, in deede, vile flatterie false is found, And tryed Trust dooth reape his due rewarde: And deepe deceite is digged vnder ground, And cogging craft can get no tale be harde: Then right may haue that reason dooth require, And due desarte may haue his deepe desire. Lo thus, deare Dame, this for my selfe I write: My troth, I trow, your selfe haue tryed well: For which (alas) I reape nought but despight, The iust cause why, God knowes, I cannot tell: Except, by stealth, some fleering flattering knaue Hath got the gaines, which I deserue to haue. Or else, perhaps, some false suspect hath bread, Misliking some, of me, without desarte: Or coye conceyte hath entred in your head To hate the man who honoures you in harte: Or double dealing seekes some secreate meane, Betwixt true friendes, true loue to banish cleane. Or else, I doubt, some shadow of a man, In my despight, some gallant wordes hath usde: On whome I vow to doe the best I can To seeke reuenge, where I am so abusde: Wherefore, good Lady, if such any bee: I humbly craue, hide not his name from mee. That I, with speede, may giue him his desarte, Or else receaue my iust and due reward: For then, when you shall see my honest harte, I doe not doubt your harte will be so harde, But you at last, although fyrst somewhat long, Will make amends to me for euery wrong. And thus, in hope no false and fonde suspect Of liking yours, shall cause such sodaine chaunge: And that you will such coye conceyts reiect, As to your friend, doo make you seeme so straunge: I rest the time that reason dooth require, When my desarte may haue his deepe desyre. [Oh! what a spight it is vnto a noble harte] Not long after, seeing his Aduersary still creeping in countenance, and himselfe almost excluded: sitting on a day alone in his Chamber, thinking on the despight of Fortune &amp; the want of discretion, in his discourteous Dame: wrote in haste these verses following. Oh! what a spight it is vnto a noble harte To see a Scabbe, without all due desarte, With no account of credit nor of fame, To winne the loue of any gallant Dame. Which valyant harts, with trauaile great and paine, Haue much adooe, long time for to obtaine. My selfe I count of valiancie but small, Yet such as may my credit well defend: And such as in my Mistresse'honour shall Be well content, with speede my lyfe to spend: Which, let me spend, and spend, and spend againe, Yet shall an other sucke my sugred gaine. With much a doo, I once did fauoure winne, Of one, in deede, a fayre and gallant Dame: Which my good happe no sooner did beginne, But by and by, to ouerthrow the same, A privie Patch, a whoreson scuruy Knaue, Inioyed the fruictes that was my right to haue. His fleering face, her peeuish fancie pleasde, My tryed troth was put out of conceyte: He gladde, I sadde, he well, and I diseasde: He caught the Fish, for which I layde the baite. He idle sate, and nothing did all day, And yet at night did beare the Bell away. But since I see, that cases so fall out, That valyaunt hearts so little are regarded: And gallaunt Dames will seeme to loue a Loute, And let a noble youthe goe vnrewarded: I will no more, henceforth, such trauaile spende In cases such: and so I make an ende. [This little Toye to thee] Not many dayes after, seeing his Mistresse' discourteous dealing, began to put her away, and chuse himself an other Mistresse: and, beeing then in the Christmas time, presented his new Mistresse with a new yeares Gifte, in this sorte. This little Toye to thee, for wante of better shifte, I heere presume for to present, as a small Newyeares gifte. The value small whereof, weigh not, I humbly craue: But take, in worth, his great good will whose friendly heart you haue. To vse braue vaunting words, will winne naught but disdaine: But valiant deeds, with words but few, be they that credit gaine. Therefore, for to be breefe, thus much I do protest: That if to worke your harts content, within my power it rest, Commaund what so thou wilt: if I denye the same, God let me never haue good looke, of any noble Dame. But you, perhaps, will thinke, these wordes are all but winde: But doo not so: first trie, then trust, and fancie, as you finde. And let not false suspect, once cause you for to deeme, That there is any one aliue, whom I doo more esteeme. But, as I doo protest, so count me your deare friend, Who likes, who loues, who honours you: and so I make an end. [I sigh to see thee sigh] A verse or two written Extempore, vpon a sight of a Gentlewoman. I sigh to see thee sigh: the iust occasion why, God knowes: and I, perhappes, can gesse, vnhappily. But whatsoeuer I thinke, I meane to let it passe: And thus, in secrete sorte, to thinke vnto my selfe (alas) Poore little seely soule, God quickly comfort thee, Who could his sighes refraine, a Dame in such sad sorte to see? The cause whereof I gesse, but not the remedy: I would I could a medicine frame, to cure thy mallady. For if it were in mee, or if it euer bee, To doo the thing, oh noble Dame, in deede, to comforte thee: My hart, my hand, my sword, my purse, which (though) but small, At your commaund I offer heere, all ready at your call. Of which if any shrinke, when you vouchsafe to trie: As I deserue, disdaine me then, and God then let me dye. And thus, from honest harte, as one your faithfull friend, In few vnfayned friendly wordes, farewell: and so an ende. [If thou canst reade, then marke what heere I write] Verses written vpon this occasion: a yong Gentleman, falling in loue with a faire yong Damsell, not knowing how to make manifest vnto her the great good will he bare her: vsing certaine talke vnto her, in the end of her talke demaunded of her, whether she could or no? she answered yea: vpon which yea, he wrote these verses following, and found time to present them vnto her presently, as he wrote them. If thou canst reade, then marke what heere I write: And what thou readst, beleeue it to be true; And doo not thinke, I doo but toyes indite: For, if thou marke in time what dooth insue, Then thou, ere long, perhaps, shalt easily fynde The effect of that, that may content thy minde. And, to be plaine, I lyke and loue thee well, And that so well, as better cannot be: What should I say? I wish that I did dwell In place where I thy selfe mought dayly see: That yet, at least, I mought injoy her sight In whom doth rest the stay of my delight. [When first I saw thee clad] A Gentleman talking on a time with a yong Gentlewoman, being apparreled very plainly, shee tolde him she was too plaine for him, he must go seeke some gallanter Geste, more meete for his tooth: to which, answering his minde afterwarde, wrote vpon the same as followeth: and gaue them vnto her to reade. When first I saw thee clad in coloures blacke and white, To gaze vpon thy seemely selfe I tooke no small delight. Thy blacke betokens modestie, thy white, a Virgins minde: And happy he may thinke himselfe, that such a one can fynde. That which is painted out with colours fresh and gay, Is of it selfe but little worth, the colours set away: But that deserueth praise, which of it selfe alone Can shew it selfe in playnest sorte, and craueth helpe of none. What should I further say? let ech man choose his choice: Though some in painted toyes delight, in plainnesse I reioyce. And why? because my selfe am plaine, as you doo see, And therefore, to be plaine with you, your plainnesse liketh me: The playnnesse of your minde, and eke your plaine attyre: For gaye and gallant Cotes is not, the thing that I desyre. But noble gallaunt minde, and yet too therewith plaine: For now and then, in gallant minds, dooth deepe deceite remaine. But for in you, fayre Dame, bothe noble gallant minde, And therewith meaning plaine in deede, I now doo plainly finde. Chuse others what they list, this plainely I protest: Your gallant minde in plaine attire, it is, that likes me best. A comparison betweene a slippery stone and a trustlesse friend. As he that treades on slippery stones, is like to catch a fall, So he that trustes to trothlesse friends, shall ill be delt withall. But he that lookes before he leapes, is likest sure to stande: So he that tryes or ere he trust, shall be on surer hand. But once found out a good sure ground, keepe there thy footing fast: So charyly keep a faithfull friend, whose friendship tride thou hast. For as some grounds that seeme full sure, in time will much decay, So some false friends that seeme full true, at neede will shrinke away. And as within some rotten groundes, some hidden holes we see, So in the hartes of faithfull friends, so many mischiefes bee. Therefore, I breefely bidde my friends for to beware in time, For feare of further after clappes: and so I end my rime. A Dolorous discourse. If he who lingers foorth a loathsome lyfe, In weary wyse, exprest with endlesse woe: To whom care still stands, as a hackeling knife, To teare the heart that is tormented so: Who neuer felte one howre, nor sparke of ioy, But deepe lyes drownde in Gulfe of foule annoy. Whom Fortune euer frounde on in his life, And neuer lent one lucky looke at all: With whome the Moone and Starres are all at strife, Who all in vaine dooth dayly crie, and call For comforte some, but yet receiueth none, But to himselfe his greefe must still bemone. Whose greefe first grew in time of tender yeares, And yet dooth still continue to this daye: Who, all berent, dooth chaunge among the Breares, And still hang fast, and cannot get awaye: Who euery way, which he dooth seeke to goe, Dooth finde some block that dooth him ouerthrow. Who neuer was, is not, nor lookes to bee, In way of weale, to ridde him of his woe: Who day by day, by proofe too plaine, dooth see That Desteny hath sworne it shall be so: That he must liue with torments so opprest, And till he die, must neuer looke for rest. If such a one may well be thought to be The onely man that knoweth misery: I may well say that I (poore man) am hee; Who dayly so doo pine in penury; Whose heauy heart is so opprest with greefe, As, vntill death, dooth looke for no releefe. To swim and sinke, to burne and be a-colde, To hope and feare, to sigh and yet to sing: And all at once, are louers fyttes of olde, To many knowen, to some a common thing: But still to synke, frye, feare, and alway sigh, Are patterns plaine, that death approcheth nigh. And doost thou then, sweete Death, approche so neare? Welcome, my friend, and ease of all my woe: A friend in deede, to me, a friend most deare, To ease my heart that is tormented so: Happy is he who lightes on such a friend, To breede his ioyes, and cause his greefes to end. A Letter sent by a Gentlewoman, in verse, to her Husband, being ouer sea. What greater greefe, than leese a cheefest ioy? Then why liue I, that lacke my cheefe delight? My friend I meane, for whom thus, in annoy, In weary wise, I passe both day and night: For loe, a friend, in deepest of distresse, To friend dooth yeeld of euery greefe redresse. His company dooth often driue away Such dolefull thoughts as mought torment the minde With friend, a friend to passe ech dolefull daye, Of comfort great, may many causes finde: A freend, sometime, but with his only sight His dolefull friend dooth many times delight. No greater ease is to some heauy heart, Yea, when it is with greatest greefes opprest: Then trusty friendes, to whom for to imparte Such cause of greefe, as breedes it such vnrest: For ofte, by telling of a dolefull tale, The tongue dooth ease the brest of mickle bale. If heart be glad, what myrth can then be more, Then when true friends doo meete with merry cheare? The greefe forgotte of absence theirs before, By presence had, doo soddaine ioyes appeare. What shall I saye? as I begone I end, No ioye to loue, no greefe to losse of friend. Then, my sweete friend, in this my deepe distresse, Let me inioy thy company againe: For thou alone must purchase my redresse, And ease my heart, that thus doth pine in paine. Thou art the friend, that euen but with thy sight Mayest me, poore soule, thy dolefull friend, delight. What now can ease my pyning pensiue heart, Thus day and night, with torments sore opprest: Then vnto thee, my friend, for to imparte Such cause of greefe, as breedes me such vnrest? For ofte, by telling of this dolefull tale, My tongue will ease my brest of mickle bale. If thou werte heere, my heart that now is sadde, To thinke on thee, whose absence breedes my wo, With thoughts on thee would soone become so glad, As should forget those greefes that gripes me so: And, as before, so now againe I ende, I feare to die, for want of thee my friend. Thou art my friend, chiefe freend, and onely Feare, My Jemme of ioy, my Jewell of delight: God onely knowes, for thy sweete sake, my deare, How I in dole doo passe ech day and night. Come, therefore, come: with speede come home againe, To comfort her, that thus dooth pine in paine. Thy louing Wife, and faithfull friend, And so will bide, till life doo end. [My hand here houering stands] One sitting in dolefull dumpes by himselfe alone, thinking to haue written some dolorous discourse, was let by occasion: and so, for want of time, wrote but onely sixe lynes, and left them vnfinished: the verses were these. (I like them, and therefore thought good to place them among other imperfections.) My hand here houering stands, to write some prety toye, My mourning mind for to delight, y? wants all worldly ioye: And Fancy offereth eke, fyne toyes for to indite vpon, To comfort thus my heauy heart, that is thus woe begon. But all in vaine: for why? my minde is so opprest with greefe, As all the pleasures in this world can lend me no releefe. Finis imperfecta. A dolorous verse, written by him, that in deede was in no small dumpes, when he wrote them. If any man doo liue of ioyes berefte, By heauens I sweare, I thinke that man am I; Who at this hower, no sparke of ioy haue lefte, But leade a life in endlesse mysery: I sigh, I sobbe: I cannot well expresse The greefes I bide, without hope of redresse. So many are the causes of my greefe, That day by day torments my mourning minde, As that almost there can be no releefe To ease my heart, till ease by death I fynde. What shall I say? what pangues but I abide? What pleasure that but is to me denyde? What sappe of sorrow but I dayly taste? What mite of myrth, that I can once attaine? What foule despight dooth follow me as faste, To plague my heart with pangues of deadly paine? Ten thousand Poets cannot paint the smarte That I abide, within my harmelesse heart. And why doo I by pen then seeke to shew The passing pangues that I doo dayly bide? The pangues I paint by pen (God wot) are few, Comparde to those, which I on euery syde Am faine to feele: and that is worst of all, Without all hope of any helpe at all. Then you, alas, that reade this mourning vearse, Waye with your selves what loathsome life I leade: And let your hearts some sparke of pitty pearce, To see me thus (as one amazde) halfe dead: Striuing for life, desyring still to dye, And yet, perforce, must pine in penurie. And thus an end of writing heere I make, But not an end of mourning, God he knowes: For when I seeke one sorrow to forsake, Another greefe a new as freshly growes: So that of force, myselfe I must content To dwell in dole, vntill my dayes be spent. [Though yesterday I brake my word] A Gentleman hauing made promise unto his Mistresse to come unto her vpon a certaine appointed day, to doo her seruice, brake promise with her: but the next day following, thinking her haste [not] of necessitie so great but then he might come soone inough to accomplishe such matters as he was wonte to doo, came: and confessing his faulte of breache of promise, professing it against his will, shewing his earnest desire of more haste, craued pardon and recoverie of credit lost, in verse as followeth. Though yesterday I brake my word, &amp; therby purchasde blame: Yet now to day, as you may see, I come to keepe the same. And though this be not halfe inough my fault to counteruaile: Yet do not you my word mistrust, though once my promise faile. For if ye knew the urgent cause that kept me so away, And therewith saw mine earnest haste to come againe this day, For to recouer credite lost: I doo my selfe assure, With little sute I should ywis, your pardon soon procure. Well, to be shorte, I hope no hart is of such crueltie, But that, in an offender, will regard humilitie. And since that noble Ladies all are pittifull by kinde, Let some remorce, good Lady mine, take roote within your minde. And doo not me, your seruaunt poore, for one small fault disdaine: But let me, by my due desarte, your fauour get againe. And though y? once I brake my word, in matters of small weight: Yet thinke not, therefore, otherwise in me to rest deceight. For in a case of credit, loe, wherein my worde I giue, If that I shrinke or eate my word, then God let me not liue: And if in me to doo you good, by worde or deede, it rest; Vnto my power, I solemne vow doo make, to doo my best. [Some pleasaunt heads, delight in prety toyes] A Gentleman beeing on a time desyred of diuers of his friendes, sitting togeather in company, to make some verses, which he graunted, and yet not knowing howe to please them all, and yet willing to perfourme his promise, wrote as followeth. Some pleasaunt heads, delight in prety toyes, And some count toyes, most meete for foolish boyes: Some greatly loue to heare a merry rime, Some stately styles, which doo to honour clime: Some loue no rimes, what euer so they bee, And some mens mindes with verses best agree. Thus euery one hath by himselfe a vaine, Which, all to please, it were to great a paine: Which since I see t'is farre too much for mee, To write what may with all mindes best agree: I thinke it best, since I haue nothing don, To make an ende of that is scarce begon. So shall I well my promise past fulfill, In writing thus, according to my skill: Which promise made of mine, I trow was this, To write a rime: and heare a rime there is: Wherein although but little reason be, Yet rime there is, and sence ynough for me. A prety Epigram, vpon Welth and Will. Where Welth doth want, there Will can bear no sway; And where Will wants, there Wealth can make no way. In many things, Welth greatly rules the roste, In some things too, selfe will, will beare a sway. To winne the wager, Welth will spare no cost, Which, to subuert, Will worketh many a way: And, in the end, let Welth doo what he can, Yet, commonly, Will stands the stouter man. [By countenaunce of face, a man may fynde] A Gentleman, marking his Mistresse angrie countenaunce without cause, tolde her of it in verse, as followeth. By countenaunce of face, a man may fynde (I say, fayre Dame, by outward view of face) Such sundry thoughts, as occupie the minde: Sometime by one, and efte another grace. Looke, with that thoughts the minde is aye possessed Straight by the lookes the same is plaine expressed. The frowning face declares a froward harte, And skouling browes a sullen stomack showes: The glauncing lookes, of priuie grutch a parte, Which hidden lyes within the heart, God knowes: The staring looke declares an earnest minde, The trouling eye, vnconstant as the winde. The smyrking looke declares a merry minde, When smiling lookes are forste from heauy heart: For some can smile, that in their hearts could finde To weepe (God wot) of greefe to ease their smarte. But who so smirking smiles with merry cheare, That countenance shewes that some good newes is neare. Some finely vse a winking kinde of wile, Some looke alofte, and some doo still looke downe: And some can fayne a frowning kinde of smile, And some can smile, that in their hearts doo frowne: And so doo I, and so doo many moe, That laugh sometime, when we could weepe for woe. But euery looke, a meaning dooth declare, Some good, some bad, some mery, and some sad: The countenaunce shewes how euery one dooth fare, Some griefe, some ioye, some sullen, and some mad: And though that many be by lookes deceiued, Yet by the lookes are meanings plaine perceiued. [Ah, be not angrie so] Some other gentlewomen in the company, angrie with this toye, pleasde with these prety verses following. Ah, be not angrie so, my words were but in iest: And more then that, I ment them not by you, I doo protest. I saw no lookes to light, nor frowning ouer much, Nor any such like sullein lookes, as might shew inward grutch. Nor smiling wantonly, but with such modestie, As might declare a merry minde, but with sobriety. But such as seeme to poute, without iust cause, in deede: Or els, vpon their friends will faine, a frowning, more then neede: Or, giglet like, will laugh, or else with anger swell, And deale in lookes disdainfully, with them that wish them well: Gainst such it is I wright, but none of you are namde: Then do not you accuse yourselues, and you may go vnblamde. And this, what I haue sayd, take well in worth, therefore: If I did ill against my will, I will doo so no more. A prety toye written upon Time. As I, of late, this other day lay musing in my bed, And thinking vpon sundrie toyes, that then came in my head: Among the rest, I thought vpon the setting out of Tyme: And thinking so vpon the same, I wrote this ragged rime. Time is set out, with head all balde, saue one odde lock before: Which locke, if once you doo let slip, then looke for Time no more. But if you hold him fast by that, and stoutly doo him stay; Then shall ye know how he dooth passe, before he goe his way. And if you keepe him tide by that, good seruice will he doo In euery worke, what so it be, that you will put him to: So that you looke vnto his worke, that he not idle stand: For if he doo, some knauish worke himself will take in hand. And th? twere better want the knaue, then haue him serue you so; When you doo think he dooth you good, y? he should worke your wo. I reade, besydes, he painted is with winges, forsooth, to flie: And Mower like, with Sithe in hand, and working earnestly: And in his worke still singing thus: This dare I boldly saye, Saue Vertue, all things I cut downe, that stand within my way. But Vertue neuer will decay, she goes before me still: But since I cannot let her stand, Ile cut elsewhere my fill. But tis no matter, hold him fast by that same lock, I say, And neither words, nor yet his wings, shall help him get away. By chaunce my selfe haue caught him fast, but euen this other day; And by that locke I holde him fast, for slipping yet away. And by that locke, as thus aduisde, I meane to holde him so, But I will know, or ere he passe, which way he meanes to go. And since I caught him so, I thinke he hath not idle stood, But somewhat he is dooing still, although but little good. And as this morning I, by chaunce, did see him idle stand, I thought it good to make him take, a Pen and Inck in hande: And hauing little else to doo, to spend a little time, In true discription of himselfe to pen this trifling rime. Which time, nor well nor yet ill spent, stands till an other time, Some better seruice for to doo: and so I ende my rime. A PRETY DISCOVRSE OF A HVNTED Harte, written by a Gentleman unto his Mistresse. To reade a dolefull tale, that tels of nought but greefe, And of a man that pines in paine, and lookes for no releefe; Whose hope of death seems sweet, &amp; dread of life seems sower, Who neuer bid on[e] merry month, one weeke, one day, or hower. In such a tale, I say, if any doe delight, Let him come read this verse of mine, that heer for troth I wright. And though the speech seeme darke, the matter shall be plaine: And he, poore wretch, of whom it treats, too wel doth feele the paine. A prety Discourse of a hunted Hart There is a pretye Chase, wherein dooth rest a Hart: Wherin for his abode (poore wretch) he keepes one only part. Adioyning to his chase, there is a prety place, Where stands a Lodge, wherin dooth dwell, the Lady of the chase. This Lady, now and then, for sport, sometime for spight, To hunt this silly harmlesse Harte dooth take a great delight. And how? with hounds (alas) and when she hunts for sporte, With little Whelpes, that c?not bite, she hunts him in this sort. Two little whelpes, I say, she casteth off at once, To course, and eke to feare him with, as meetest, for the nonce. And with these little whelps she bringes him to the bay: And then, at bay she takes them vp, and let him goe his way. And if for spight she hunt, she takes another way: She casteth of no little whelps, to bring him to the bay, But cruell byting Curres: at once she castes of all: And with those cruell cankred Curres, she followes him to fall: And being falne (poore wretch) pining in extreame paine, She casteth off her cruell curres, and lets him rise againe: Untill she hunts againe, to make her selfe like sporte: And then, euen as she is disposde, she hunts him in like sorte. Thus liues this harmelesse Heart, opprest with endlesse wo: In daunger still of Death by Dogges, and yet cannot dye so. And neither day nor night, he feedeth but in feare, That these same Dogges should lye in waite, to course him euery where. Thus restlesse restes this Harte, and knowes not how to rest: Whose hope of death, in midst of course, it is that likes him best. God send him better rest, a speedy death at least, To rid him of his great vnrest, and breede him quiet rest. The meaning of the Tale. But wherto tends this Tale? what first may meane this Chase? And then the Harte, which in y? same doth keep one only place? The Plot where st?ds the Lodge, the Lodge, &amp; then the Dame Which hunts the Hart: &amp; last, the Dogs which do pursue the game? A meaning all they haue: which meaning I must showe, And that so plaine, as in each point the meaning you may knowe. My Carkase is the Chase, my Heart the selly Harte: Which, for his rest, my woefull brest, dooth keepe that onely parte. The Platte where stands the Lodge, my head I count that place: My Minde the Lodge, my Loue the Dame &amp; Lady of the Chase. Her Dogges of diuers kindes, that doo my Heart pursue, Sometime to baye, sometime to fall, are these that doo ensue. And first, the Dogges with which she hunts sometime for sport, To bring my Harte vnto the baye, and leaue him in that sort, Are these, beleeue me now. Discountenaunce is the fyrst, The second is Discourtesie, and of the two, the worst. Discountenaunce hee comes fyrst, and feares me, in this wise: He hangs his lip, holds downe his head, &amp; lookes vnder his eyes. And with that angry looke hee feares me in such sort, That I may not abide the same: and then beginnes the sport. For then shee casteth of Discortesie, that Curre: And then doo what I can, alas, my Heart beginnes to sturre. And wearie halfe at last, I stand with them at baye: And so at baye, for my defence, I somewhat ginne to saye. Which sayde, shee then takes of those hylding Curres againe, And leaue me, till she hunt againe, thus pining all in paine: And now the Cruell Curres, with which she takes delight To hunt my Hart euen till he fall, are these: not first, Despight, But fowle Disdaine: then hee, which Curres doo course him soe That to the fall they bring me ofte, and yet then let me goe. So that my Harte dooth liue— but howe? alas, in dreade Of these same deuillish Dogges: &amp; so still shall, till I bee dead. Who would not blame this Dame, that thus, without desart, With these her cruell cankred Curs dooth hunt this seely Hart: And curse those cruell Curres, that thus doo make her sport: Bothe day and night, without cause why, do hunt him in such sort. And wish this seely Hart, with endelesse griefes opprest, To scape the daunger of the Dogges, and finde some quiet rest. But wish who list to wish, except that you, deere Dame, Among the rest, do wish that wish, no wish wyll helpe the same. But if that you, in deede, so wish among the rest, And hartely do wish that wish, your wish will helpe him best. A straunge Dreame. Who so he be on earth, that wisely can deuine Vpon a Dreame: come shewe his skyll vpon a Dreame of mine: Which, if that well he marke, sure he shall finde therein Great misteries, I gage my life: which Dreame did thus begin. Me thought I walked too and fro, vpon a hillie land, So long, till euen with wearinesse, I could wel scarcely st?d. And weery so (me thought) I went to leane against an Oke: Where leaning but a while, me thought, the tree in peeces broke. From which, me thought, to saue my life I lightly skipt away: And at the first, the sight thereof my senses did dismay: But when I stayed so a while, and looked rounde about, And sawe no other dreadfull sight, I knew not what to doubt. But to some house (me thought) alas, I wisht my selfe full faine: But when I lookte, I could not see one house vpon the plaine: Good Lord (thought I) where am I now? what desart place is this? How came I heere? what shall I doo? my heart full fearefull is. And therewithall (me thought) I fell flat downe vpon my knee, And humble praiers made to God on high, to comfort me Holding a Citterne in her hand, wherewith to mee she came: And gaue it me, desiring mee to play vpon the same. More halfe afeard to see this sight, O Lady fayre! quoth I, My skyll too simple is, God wot, to sound such harmony. Yet playe, quoth shee, the best thou canst, it shall suffice, I say; Doo thy good will, I craue no more, therefore, [I] (praye thee) play. With that, mee thought, I tooke the same, and sounded, by and by, (Not knowing what I did myselfe,) a Heauenly harmony. Unto which tune, the Lady then so sweete a song did sing: As, if I could remember it, it were a Heauenly thing. Of all which song, one onely steppe I still doo beare in minde, And that was this—There is no ioye vnto content of minde: No plague, to pride: no woe, to want: no greefe, to lucklesse loue: No foe to fortune, friend to God: no trueth, tyll tryall prooue. No Serpent, to sclaunderous tongue: no corsey, vnto care: No losse, to want of libertie: no griefes, to Cupids snare. No foole, to fickle fantasie, that turnes with euery winde: No torment, vnto Jelosy, that still disturbes the minde. Lo, this was all I bare in minde, the rest I haue forgot: Vnto my griefe, O God, he knowes: but since I haue it not, Well, let it passe: this Lady fayre when she had sung her song, She layde me downe a Napkin faire vpon the ground along, As white as Snowe: which when I saw, I muzed what she ment: But then (mee thought) fr? thence againe, a little space she went, And calde mee thus: Hoe, maides, I say! when will you come away? Tis time that dinner ready were, tis very neere midday. Wher with, mee thought, from out no house, but fr? a bushy bancke, Came out eight Damsels, all in white: two and two in a ranck, In order right, and euery one a fine Dish in her hand, Of sundry meates: some this, some that, and down vpon the land They laide me downe their Delycates, wheras this Napkin lay: Which done, fowre of th? staied stil, the rest went straight away Unto the place fr? whence they came, the Bushy Banke (I meane) And sodenly, I wot not howe, they all were vanisht cleane. But, to goe onwardes with my dreame in order briefe I will, To make discourse of these fowre Dames behind that staied still. First, one of them fell downe on knee, and solempnely sayd Grace: Another, she with Pleasant Herbes bestrowed all the place: The thirde, she with a Bason fayre of water sweete did stand: The fourth, demurely stoode, and bare a Towell in her hand. I standing still, as one amaz'd, to see so straunge a sight, Yet seeing nothing but might serue my minde for to delight; The Lady (Mistris) of them all, that kept her Royall seate, Rose vp, and comming towards me did greatly me entreate To come vnto her stately boorde: seeing me still yet to stand Amazed so, she came herselfe, and tooke me by the hand: Come on, and sitte thee downe, quoth she, be not afraide, I say: And eate, quoth she, for well I know thou hast not dinde to daye. Faire Dame, quoth I, I cannot eate, my stomack serues me not: Therefore, I pardon craue. Quoth she, thou art afraide, I wot, To see this seruice heere so straunge: indeede, tis straunge to thee: For men but fewe or none do come our seruice heere to see. And happy thou maist thinke thy self, that thou camst heere this day, For very fewe vnto this hill can hap to hit the way. We liue within these desart woods, like Ladyes, all alone: With Musick, passing forth the day, and Fellows we haue none: We are not like the wretches of the world, in many a place, That many liues, for feare or shame, dare scarsly shew their face. We spend the day in fine disport, somtime with Musicke sweete, Somtime with Hunting of y? Hart, somtime, as we thinke meete, With other Pastimes, many one: sometime with pleasant talke We passe y? time, somtime for sporte, about the Fields we walke, With Bowe and Arrowes (Archer-like) to kill the stately Deere: Which, being slaine, we roste &amp; bake, &amp; make our selues good cheere: Our meate we roste againe the Sunne, we haue none other fire: Sweete water Springs do yeelde vs drinke, as good as we desire. For herbe and roots, we haue great store, here growing in the wood, Wherwith we many dainties make, as we our selues think good. In Sommer time, our Houses here, are Arbers, made of Trees: about the which, in sommer time, do swarme such Hiues of Bees, As leaves vs then, of hony sweete, such store as well dooth serue Insteede of Sugre, all the yeare, our fruites for to preserue. Besides, they yelde vs store of waxe, which from the Hiues we take: And for our lights, in winter nights, we many Torches make. For then our houses all are Caues, as well thy selfe shalt see, When thou hast dinde: for I my self will go, and shew them thee: Therefore, be bolde, and feare no more, for thou shalt go with me: From perils all, within this place, I will safeconduct thee: And taste of one of these same herbes, which thou thy selfe likst best: The fayrest flower, trust me, oft times is not the holsommest. But as for these same herbes, or flowers, that stand vpon my boord: There is not one but is right good, beleeue me, on my word. Take wher thou list, I giue thee leaue: but first, my fri?d, (quoth she) Pul of thy gloue, &amp; wash thy hands.— Wherwith, a maid brought me A bason faire, of water cleare, which gaue a sent so sweete, That, credit me, me thinkes almost, that I doo smell it yet. Wherein I softly dipt my hands, and straight, to wipe the same, Vpon her arme, a towell brought, an other gallant dame: Of whom, I could none other doo, but take in courteous sorte, With humble thanks for seruice such: and so, for to be short, With reuerence done vnto the Dame, who kept her stately seate, I sat me downe: and hongerly, (me thought) I fell to eate. First of a Salet, that, me thought, hard by my trencher stoode: Whereof, at first, me thought the tast was reasonable good: But being downe, it left (alas) a bitter tang behinde: Then that I left, and thought to taste some herbes of other kind. And therewithall, I gan of her, in humble sort to craue, The roote that I had tasted so, what name the same might haue: It is Repentance roote, quoth she, whose taste though bitter be, Yet in the Spring time holsome tis, and very rare to see. But in the ende of all the yeare, when it is nothing worth, In euery foolish fielde it growes, to shewe the braunches forth: But if the taste thou likest not, then set away the same, And taste of somewhat else, (quoth she) &amp; straight (at hand) a Dame Stoode reedy by, at her commaund to take the Dish away: Which done, then of an other herbe, I gan to take a say, Which better farre did please my taste, whereof I fedde on well. Good Lady, quoth I, of this herbe vouchsafe to me to tell The proper name? This holsome herbe, is called Hope (quoth she) And happy he, who of this herbe, can get a peece, of me. This herbe preserues the life of man, euen at poincte of death: Wh? they are speechles, often times, this herbe doth lend th? breth. This driues Dispaire, fr? brainsick heds, this salueth many a sore, This is reliefe, to euery griefe: what vertue can be more? Feede well thereon, quoth she, and thou shalt finde such ease of mind, As by no meanes, but onely that, is possible to finde. O Lady faire, quoth I, I humble thankes doo yeelde, For this thy friendly fauour great: but now, if to the fyelde Wheras this herbe so rare doth grow, if you wil deigne (faire dame) Me to conducte: and shewe me eke, the true roote of the same: Twise happy shall I thinke my selfe, that thus, by chaunce, I found So courteous a noble Dame, and such a fertil ground. The roote (quoth she) yes, thou shalt see, when thou hast dinde anon, Both roote and herbe &amp; eke the ground which it doth grow vpon.— Dine Lady, quoth I, I haue dinde: this herbe hath fyld me so, That when you will, I ready am vnto that ground to goe. Which ground and roote for to behould I haue so great desire, That till I see the same, me thinkes, my hart is still on fyre. Well then, quoth shee, since after it I see thou longest so, I will my dinner shorter make, and with thee I will goe: And bring thee to the place, where thou both roote and herb shalt see, And gather eke a peece therof, and beare away with thee. And therwith, from the boorde she rose, and tooke me by the hand, And led me ouerthwart, me thought, a peece of new digd land: And so from thence into a wood, in midst wherof, me thought, She brought me to a great wilde Maze: which sure was neuer wrought By Gardeners h?ds: but of itself, I rather gesse it grew: The order of it was so straunge: of troth, I tell you true. Well, in into this Maze we went: in midst whereof we founde, In comely order, well cut out, a prety peece of grownde. The portrayture whereof, was like the body of a man: Which, viewing well, foorthwith, me thought, this Lady gan To kneele her downe, vpon the ground, hard by the body, loe: And there she shewed me the herbe, that I desired soe: And eke the order howe it grew: which viewing well, at last She brake a peece, and gaue it mee to take thereof a taste, Fresh fr? y? ground: which don, traight way, Well now, y? roote, q? she, Thou lookest for: but stay a while, and thou it straight shalt see. The roote is like an other roote, but onely that in name: In difference from all other rootes: and, to declare the same, When thou hast seene it, thou shalt knowe (&amp; therwithall, quoth she,) Come heere, beholde the roote, which thou desirest so to see: And therwith, digging up a Turfe, she shewde me very plaine The fashion of it, how it grewe: and downe she laide againe The Turfe in place whereas it was: O Lady fayre, quoth I, If one should seeme to cut the roote, what? would y? herb then die? No, no, quoth she, vntill the roote be plucked quite away, The roote it selfe, be sure of this, will neuer quite decay. Then would I craue a peece thereof, (quoth I) O noble Dame, That I may know it, if againe I chaunce to taste the same. The taste, quoth she, vnpleasaunt is, I tell thee that before: But where the roote, dooth rancor breed, y? herbe wil salue the sore. But yet to make thee for to knowe the taste thereof, quoth she: She raisde the Turfe, and of the roote she brake a peece for me. And downe she layde the same againe, in order as she found: That scarsely well it could be seene, that she had raisde y? ground. Well, I had my desire therein: but tasting of the same, It was so bitter in my mouth, that to allaye the same, I was full glad to take the herbe which, as the Dame did say, The bitter taste of that vile roote, did quickly driue away. And then, in humble sort, quoth I, O fayre and courteous Dame, Since that this roote (as you doo say) dooth differ much in name From other rootes, O let me know what his true name may be? His name, quoth she, Necessitie is, truely credit me. And of these Rootes, some lesse then some: but bigger that they be, The more doth Hope spred forth his leaues: &amp; som do go with me. Now I haue showne thee thy desire, this hearb, this roote, &amp; gro?d, I back againe will bring thee, to y? place wher first thy self I fo?d. So, to be short, we backe returnde vnto the place againe, From whence we went: where, sitting still, attendant did remaine These fowre faire Dames, whom ther we left: but al y? dishes they, And what else on the Boorde was left, they all had borne away. Well, beeing come vnto the place, vp rose they all at once: And to this Lady reuerence did, and likely, for the nonce. They knew their Mistresse minde right well, her vse belike it was: Of water cleere vpon the ground, they full had set a Glasse. Hard by the Glasse a Towell faire, and by the Towell, Flowers: Loe, Youth, quoth she, how likst thou now this seruice heer of ours? Couldst thou thus like to liue in woods, &amp; make thy cheefe repaste On hearbs and rootes, as we do heere? or else the life thou haste? Troubled, tormented, euery howre, and that with endlesse griefe: In hope of helpe, and now againe despayring in reliefe? Still to reserue? We heere thou seest doo lyve in quietnesse: We passe the time without all care, in myrth and ioyfulnesse: We feare no foe, we feele no woe, we dread no daungers great: We quake not here with too much cold, nor burn w? extreme heate: We wish not for great heapes of gold, such trash we do despise: We pray for health &amp; not for wealth: and thus, in pleasant wise, We spende the day full ioyfully: we craue no ritch attire, This thinne white weede is euen asmuch as we do here desire. We haue our Musique sweete, besides, to sollace, now and than, Our weerie minds with other sports: &amp; now, how saist thou, man? If thou maist haue thy choyce, which wouldst thou rather do? Leade heere thy lyfe, lyke one of vs, or els returne vnto The loathsome lyfe, that now thou leadst? pause on this that I say: If th' one thou chuse, here tary styll: if th' other, hence away Thou must returne from whence thou comst, I put it to thy choyce: If th' one thou chuse, of thy good happe thou euer mayst reioyce: But if thou choose amisse, poore wretch, then thank thy self therfore: Consider well vpon my words, as yet I saye no more. With that, more halfe amazde hereat, still standing in a muze, Not knowing what were best to doe, to take or to refuze The proffer made me by this Dame, I humbly fell on knee: Beseeching God to graunt me of his grace to gouerne me, To make me chuse that choice y? best mought please his holy will: And sitting so, in humble wise, on knee thus praying still: The Dame, expecting earnestly some annswer at my hand, So long, quoth she, vpon this choice, why doo you studying stand? Some aunswer briefely let me haue, what euer so it be: What? wilt thou back returne againe? or wilt thou bide with me? One way, faire Dame, quoth I, I gladly here would stay, And leade my life here still with you: but now another way Reason perswades me to returne: thus in a doubt twixt bothe, I one way loue the life I led, another way I lothe. So that remaining thus in doubt, a certaine aunswer for to giue, Whether back againe for to returne, or in these woods to liue I most desire, I cannot sure: therefore, I pardon craue, And for an aunswer flat, I may some longer respit haue? O no, quoth she, I cannot graunt thee longer time, not nowe To pause vpon these words of mine: and therefore, since that thou Wylt backe returne, loe, here behold, this narrow foote path heere: Go, follow this, vntill thou comst vnto a Temple neere: Then leaue this pathe, and presently crosse ouer to the same: And there, for further help fr? thence, your praiers humbly frame Unto Dame Pittie, and her tell that straight from me you came, And she will help you, for my sake: Dame Patience is my name: And for a token true, that you were sent to her by me: Say, Patience will Pittie mooue, and she will credit thee: And so, farewell, when thou hast been a yeere or more away, If thou wilt hither make returne, and be content to stay: Though thou beest wo?ded many a way, and plagde with many a sore, Thou shalt haue ease of euery greef: &amp; th? what wouldst haue more? And so, my Youth, quoth she, adue, I may no longer stay: Haue good regard to this foote path, for feare thou goe astray: And for a farewell, eare thou goest, to me, thy courteous friend, In song come beare a part with me: which, being at an ende, Then fare thou well: and therewithall an Instrument she tooke, And bad one of her Maides with speede, go fetch her forth a booke, Which termed was, The trackt of time: which by &amp; by, me thought, Ere one could well say, thus it was: in humble wise she brought, With such an humble reuerence, doune to this noble Dame: That sure it would haue done one good, for to haue seen the same. Well, opening the Booke of Songs, and looking well therein: At last she staide, and on she plaide: which Song did thus begin. Who seeketh far, in time shall finde great choice of s?dry change: In time a man shall passe the Pikes of peryls wonderous strange. But he that trauaileth long Time, to seeke content of minde: And in the end, in trackt of Time his owne desire shall finde: And beeing well, is not content to keepe him where he is: His time is lost, vnworthy he to finde the place of blisse. One Time a fault may be forgiuen, but if thou once obtaine The place of rest: marke well the way vnto the same againe. For if thou once doo misse the way, or hast the same forgot: Thou wander maist, a tedious Time, &amp; neare the neere, God wot. Therefore, in Time I warne thee well to haue a great regarde: The way thou goest for to returne: for trust me, it is hard. And so, for want of longer Time, I needes must make an ende: Take time enough, marke wel thy way, and so, farewell, my friend, Till Time I see thee heere againe: which Time let me not see, Till Time thou canst content thy self, to spend thy Time with me. And so take time, while time will serue, else Time will slip away: So once againe, adew, quoth she, I can no longer stay. With y?, me thought, this heauenly Dame, with all her maides, was gon: And I, poore soule, vpon the hill, was left so all alone: Where taking heede vnto the path, which she had shewde me so: Crosse overthwart the hill, (me thought) I gan to goe. At foote whereof, harde by the path, me thought a Riuer ran, And down y? streame, in a small boat, me thought there came a m?: And by and by he cald to me, to aske me if I would Come take a boat to crosse the streame? and if I would, I should: Now crosse the riuer straight (me thought) I sawe a beaten way Likely to lead vnto some Towne: whereat I gan to stay: But nought I said: and therewithall (me thought) I plaine did see The Dame who late had lefte me quite, approching neere to me: And beeing neere come to me, me thought she stoutly saide, Why do you lose your labour so? what cause hath heere you staide? Keepe on your way, and lose no Time, and happy sure art thou, Thou tookst not boate or ere I came: but, quite past danger now: My selfe will bring thee thither, where The Temple thou shalt see Whereto I gave thee charge to go: and so, (me thought) quoth she, Come follow me: and by and by no great way we had gon, But straight she brought me to the hill, this Temple stood vpon. And ther (me thought) these words she said: Go, knock at y?der dore, And say thou art a seely wight, cast vp on sorrowes shore; Brought in the Barke of wearie bale, cast vp by waues of woe: The Barke is burst, thou sav'de aliue, dost wander too and froe, To seeke some place of quiet rest: and wandring so about The hil of Hope, where Patience dwels, by chance thou foundest out: From whom thou presently doost come, a message to declare: Beare this in minde, thou shalt get in, well warrant thee I dare. And when thou comst into the Church, mark wel on the right hand, Within the Quire, all cladde in white, dooth Lady Pittie stand: To whom, with humble reuerence, saye this for thy behoue: I doo beleeue that Patience in time will Pittie moue. And thus this lesson I thee leaue: which if thou beare in minde, Assure thy selfe straight, at her hands, some fauor for to finde. And thus, quoth she, againe farewell, though me no more thou see, Till backe thou doost returne againe, yet I will be with thee: And guide thee so, where so thou goest, that thou thy selfe shalt see, In many Melancolike moodes, thou shalt be helpt by me. And therewithall, I know not how, she vanished away: And I vnto the Temple straight began to take my way. And to the doore, as I had charge, me thought I came: And tooke the ring [with] in my hand, and knocked at the same: Who knocketh at the doore, quoth one? A silly wight, quoth I, Cast vp of late, on sorrowes shore, by tempests soddenly: Brought in the Barke of weary bale, cast vp by waues of woe: Since when, to seeke some place of rest I wandred too and froe. And wandring so, I knew not how, vnto a Mount I came, Whereas I found in comely sort, a noble courteous Dame. The mo?t is cald the Hill of Hope, wher doth Dame Pati?ce dwel: From whom I come: Welcome, quoth he, I know the Lady wel. With that the doore, was opened, and in, (me thought) I went: Wherewith, me thought I hard a voyce a sobbing sigh that sent. Wherewith somewhat amazd at first, though greatly not afraide, Still staring round about (a while) this stately Church, I staide. And as before Dame Patience, to me at parting tolde, Within the Quier, on the right hand, (me thought) I did behold A gallant Dame, all clad in white, to whom, for my behoue, These words I sayd, Dame Patience, I hope, will Pittie mooue. With that (me thought) this Lady sayd, I know thy deepe distresse: And for thy fri?d, Dame Pati?ce sake, thou shalt haue som redresse. And therwithall, me thought, she saide vnto an aged Sire, Which in the Temple hard by sate: Father, I thee desire To shew this Youth, the perfect path vnto the place of rest, Who long hath wandred vp &amp; down, with torments sore opprest. Dame Patience hath stoode his friend, and sent him vnto me, To lend him helpe vnto this place, where he desires to be. Lady, quoth he, I cannot go my selfe abroade to day, But I will send my seruant here, to shew him the right way: Whose company if he will keepe, beleeue me, he shall finde In little time, a place that may right well content his minde. Which if he do not, yet let him with him returne to me, And then my selfe will go with him. It shall suffice, quoth she: Go, sirra, quoth she, follow well [t]his man, where so he goes: And take good heede, that in no wise his company you loose: For if you lose his company, you lose your labour quite: But follow him, your gaine perhaps your trauaile, shall requite: His name, quoth she, True Reason is, my Father Wisdoms man: Whom, if you follow, to the place of rest, conduct you can. So, sirra, quoth she, go your wayes, be rulde by him, I say: And though he leade you now &amp; th? through some vnplesant way, Yet follow him where so he goes: doo as I bid you doe, And he, in time, the perfect place of rest, can bring thee too: And so, farewell, Lady, quoth I, I humble thankes do giue To you, and eke this good olde man: and sure, while I doo liue, You two, I vowe, and eke besides the noble curteous Dame That sent me hither vnto you, Dame Patience by name, In hart I euer honour will: and honest Reason loe, For taking paines, vnto the place of rest with me to goe. To recompence his paines, I vowe to stand his faithfull friend, To follow him, and to be rulde by him vnto mine ende. And if I seeke to slippe from him, I willing aye will be, That, as he list, he shall doo due correction vpon me: So Lady, I my leaue doo take: and therewithall, me thought, The good olde man, fast by the hande vnto the doore me brought: And at the doore (me thought) did part, this good olde man and I: And Reason, he came stepping forth, to beare me company: Or else to leade me to the place whereas we then should goe: But as in euery merry moode, dooth happe some sodaine woe: So in this Dreame, as we (me thought) were going on our waye, I know not well at what (alas) we suddainly gan staye: And staying so, a Phesant Cocke hard by me I gan see, Which, flying by me, crew so lowde, as that he waked me. And thus my Dreame was at an end: which, when that I awoake, I tooke my penne, and as you see I put it in my booke: Which, for the straungenesse of the same, surely perswadeth mee, It dooth some straunge effect pretend, what euer so it be. The huge highe Mountaine, fyrst of all? and then the brok? tree? And then the Lady, soddainly, that did appeare to me? The Napkin lying on the gro?d? &amp; then the Dames that came In order so, with Dishes all, vnto this noble Dame? And wherefore, onely fowre of them went backe againe away: And other fowre attendaunt still vpon this Dame did staye? And what should meane the giuing of the Citterne, vnto me To playe vpon? and that my selfe, should sound such Harmonie, Which neuer playde on like before? and then the Song that she Vnto the tune that I so playde, dyd sweetley sing to me? Then what should meane the order, that the Maidens did obserue, As they vpon this stately Dame, attendaunt still did serue? The Bason, Towel, &amp; the Flowres, wher with she strawd y? place? And one alone among the rest, so humbly saying Grace? What ment her stately keeping of her royall Princely seate? And what she ment, by bidding me, to wash before I eate? And when, as one amazed, so she did behold me stande: What she should meane to rise her selfe &amp; take me by the hand? Then what should meane the bytter roote that first I fed vpon: And tasting of the herbe of Hope, the bitter taste was gon? Then what should meane my great desyre to see that herb to grow: And how the Lady ledde me straight, whereas she me did show? The herbe, the roote, the ground, &amp; all, and why I then did craue Of that same roote, or ere I went, a little taste to haue? Then what should meane the cutting vp the Turfe, to let me see The roote? and then the breaking of a peece thereof for me? Then what should meane y? laying down, the turfe, ev? as she fo?d, So closely as could scarse be seene, that she had styrde the ground? And then what ment the great wilde Maze, the Image of a man Whereas it grew? and after that our backe returning than? What ment the Glasse of water, that at our returne we found: The towel, and the flowers besides, downe lying on the ground? Then what Dame Patience should meane, for to demaund of me, Howe I did like her seruice there, and whither I could be Content to liue with her or not, or backe returne to chuse? And that she put it to my choice, to take or to refuse? And backe returnde to my olde life, then what she ment to say: If well I chose, I mought reioyce, for to haue seene that day? If contrary, why then I mought but thanke my selfe therefore? And bad me pause vpon her words, and then would say no more? Then what should meane my kneeling so, and praying th? of mine To God, for grace to take and chuse, to please his will diuine? Then what the Lady ment in hast, as I was kneeling so, To aske to that she did demaund an aunswer, yea, or no? Then what my doubtfull aunswer ment, and pardon I did craue, That for an aunswer flat, I might some longer respit haue? And why she should no respit giue? then what the path way ment? And what she ment, in that she me vnto the Temple sent? The Lesson that she gaue me then, and then Dame Pitty too? And what besides, at the Church door, she further bad me doo? Then, at our parting, the sweete song which ran of Time so much? What y? shold mean, &amp; what should mean our choice of musick such? Her song once done, what then should meane the vanishing away, Wherewith my selfe at first a while amazed so did stay? But going onwards on my way, what ment the Riuer then That ran so neer the path? and then the Boate? and then the man? And then what should be ment, in that he called so to me, To take a Boate to crosse the streame? the way that I did see, Likely to leade vnto some towne? what too was ment by that Whereto I made no aunswer, but, I stayed looking at? And then againe, what ment the Dame who vanished away, To come vnto me there againe, and what she ment to saye? I happy was I had not tane a Boate or ere she came: And how from thence with me, vnto the Temple neere she came? Then, what should meane the lesson, that she gaue me for to say At the Church doore? and then againe, her vanyshing away? Then what should meane the stately Church? and, as I sayd before, The lesson that I did rehearse when I came to the doore? Then what should meane y? sighe I heard? then what y? Lady ment, Apparrelled in white, to whom Dame Patience had me sent? Then what my kneeling ment to her, and then my words I sayde? And that at my first entring in I was so much afraide? And what should meane the aunswer then the Lady gaue to me? And how that from Dame Patience I came, she did well see? Then what should meane her saying, that she knew right well my grief: And for Dame Patience sake, I shold be sure to find relief? Then what should meane the aged man, of whom she did request To take the paines to bring me to the place of quiet rest? Then what the old man ment to say, he could not go that day, But he would send his servaunt then, to bring me on the way? Then what the Lady ment to say that should as then suffice: And charging me his company to keepe in any wise? And then what ment the Lady then, to bydde me farewell soe? And th? what ment this old mans m?, that forth with me did go? And then my thanks vnto the Dame, and to the good olde man? And to Dame Patience, my friend, and eke our parting than At the Church doore, with y? olde Sire? and th? what should be ment By him, that for to bring me to the place of Rest was sent? And then, what should be ment by this, in going of our way, I know not how, but soddainly we both at once gan staye? And last, of that accursed Cocke: what should the meaning be, That in his flying crew so lowde, as that he waked me? Which Cocke, I am perswaded sure, if that he had not beene: Some wondrous sight, in trauailing, I, doubtles, should haue seen: And that which grieues me most of all, the place of quiet rest That man would sure haue brought me too: where now, with grief opprest, I must perforce liue as I do, and only haue this ease,— To pray unto Dame Patience my sorrowes to appease: Who promisde me, at parting last, that though I her not see Long time againe in open sight, yet she would be with me: And guide me so from place to place, where euer so I goe, That I by her shall finde great ease Of many a deadly woe. In hope whereof, thus, as you see, my wearie life I spende, Till I the place of Rest attaine: and so I make an ende. This Dreame is strainge: and sure, I thinke it dooth Pronosticate Some straunge effect, what so it is: but since I know not what It dooth pretend: I still will praye to God, me to defend In daungers all, bothe daye and night, vnto my lyues end. And when this loathsome life I end, with torments so opprest, In Heauen I may, at latter daye, enioye a place of rest. A prety Toye written vpon this Theame: A man a sleepe, is not at rest. Although the heart a sleepe, the bones be all at rest, Yet man a sleepe, his minde is oft with many thoughts opprest. He dreames of this and that: sometime with trifling toyes His onely minde is troubled sore: sometime of pleasaunt ioyes His minde dooth run in sleepe: sometime, he dreames of Kinges, Of Princes Courts &amp; princely feates, and of such gallant thinges: And, by and by, is out in midst of all his dreame, And from the Court to country Clowns, and of a messe of Creame: Of Cattle in the feelde, of woods and pasture groundes, Of Hawking, Fyshing, Fowling too, &amp; hunting hare with ho?ds: And sodeinly, vnwares, he leaues his countrey sport, And from the countrey, by and by, to Cittie dooth resort. And there a thousand things at once runs in his minde: The gallant shops of sundry sortes, and wares of sundry kinde: The precious Pearles and stones on Goldsmiths shops that shine: And then the Horsehead, but hard by and then a cuppe of Wine. Besides all gallant showes, yet one aboue the rest, The Marchaunts wiues, with other dames, in fine attire adrest, That at their dores, sometime on Sundayes vse to sit: This when some doo behold by day, by night they dreame of it. And then they fall in loue, although their sute be small: For in the Morning once awakte, they haue forgotten all. Some dreame of cruell warres, of men slaine here and there: And all the Fields with bodyes dead nye couered euery where. And by and by, the warres not scarcely halfe begon: But who dooth get the victory, and then the warres are done. And sodeinly againe, he cannot tell which way, He is at sea, and there he sees great Fishes gan to play: And straight a tempest comes, that makes the waues to rore: And then he seeth how the Ships doo saile in daunger sore. Anon he sees his ship with billowes beaten so: That comes at last a sodaine waue, that dooth her ouerthrow: And there, both she, and all her Marriners are dround: Yet he himselfe, he knowes not how, is safely set on ground. He onely is at shore, when all the rest are lost: And there he sees, how other ships with tempests like are tost. And there he stands not long, but straight a suddaine chaunge: He carryed is, he knowes not how, into a Countrey straunge: And there he speakes a speech he neuer spake before: And once awake againe, perhaps, he neuer shall speake more. A thousand things too, more, a man dooth thinke to see In sleepe sometimes, that neuer were, nor yet are like to be. For I my selfe haue dreamde, in sleepe, of sightes so straunge, And, in the midst of all my dreame, of sodaine sundry chaunge: That, in the morne awake, I could but merueile much, What cause by day, by night should driue me into dreaming such. But sitting so a while, sometime I call to minde A prouerbe olde, which some count true, but I meere false doo finde: That is, That man asleepe dooth lie at quyet rest: For many sleepe, y? haue their mindes with many greefes opprest. Some Dreame of Parents death, or death of some deare friend: Some dreame of sorrowes to insue, and pleasures at an end. And dreaming so, I thinke that man is not at rest, Although he sleepe, his heart is yet sore troubled in the brest. The Boye that goes to Schoole dooth dreame of Rods by night, His breech too, ready for the rodde: and in a soddaine fright He starteth in his sleepe, and waketh therewithall: And then say I, although he sleepe, his rest can be but small. Some thinke in sleepe they are in Field with foe at fight, And with their fysts they buffet them that lie with them by night. And are they not at rest, although they sleepe, say you? In deede they haue a kinde of rest, but rest, I wot not how. And many causes moe of great vnquiet rest, I could declare, that are in sleepe: but these that are exprest May well suffice, I hope, to prooue my iudgement good in this: That minde of man is troubled much, when moste a sleepe he is. Another Toye written in the praise of a Gilliflower, at the request of Gentlewomen: and one, aboue the rest, who loued that Flower. If I should choose a prety Flower, For seemely show, and sweetest sente: In my minde, sure, the Gilliflower I should commend, where so I wente: And if neede be, good reasen too I can alledge why so I doe. The Crimson coulour, fyrst of all, Dooth make it seemely to the eye: The pleasaunt savour therewithall Comfortes the braine too, by and by: For collour then and sweetest smell The Gilliflower must beare the Bell. This is in Pots preserued we see, And trimly tended euery day: And so it dooth deserue to bee, For sure, if I mought plainly say: If it would prosper in my Bedde, I would haue one at my Beds head. What laugh you at? you thinke I iest, I meane plaine troth, I promise ye: The Gilliflower dooth like me best Of all the Flowers that ere I see. And who that dooth mislike the same, In my minde, shall be much too blame. A pretty toye wrytten in the praise of a straunge Springe in Suffolke. I neuer trauailde countreys farre, whereby strange things to see, As woods and waters, Beasts &amp; byrds, wherein such vertues bee, As are not common to be had, but seeldome to be found: And hearbes and stones, of nature such, as none are on the ground. But as I haue red of many one, and surely, in my minde, As well at home as farre abroad, I many straung things finde. But many men whose runing heads, delights abroad to range, Whose fancies fond are dayly fed, With toyes and choice of change: What euer their owne soyle dooth yeeld, they do no whit esteeme: But far fet &amp; deare bought, that they most worthy praise doo deeme. But tis no matter, let that passe, ech one, where he thinkes best, Choose what and wh? and where he likes, &amp; leue his frends the rest. And let me speake in praise of that, which worthy, in my minde, And therewith, rare like to be seene in England, here I fynde. No beast, nor byrde, no stick nor stone, no hearbe nor flower it is, No foule nor Fish, no metall strange: nought but a Spring ywis. But such a Spring, so cleare, so fayre, so sweete and delicate: That happy he may thinke himselfe, that may come sip thereat. To speake in praise thereof at large, it were to much for me, As it deserues; but if I were a Poet, as some be: Sure I would spend a little time to let the world to know, That out of our small Iland yet, so fyne a Spring dooth flow. In Ouids Metamorphosis I read there of a Spring, Whereby Narcissus caught his bane, [and] only with looking Long while vpon the same: for loe, the water shone so cleare, That thorow the same, the shadow of his face did so appeare, That he forgetting quite himselfe, fell so enamoured Of his owne face, that there he lay as one amazde, halfe dead: So long, till at the last, for want of very foode, He fell starke madde, and lost his life in place whereas he stoode: And after his ghost yeelded vp, (at least, as Poets faine,) His Corps was turned to a flower which there did stil remaine: Which flower, if I doo not mistake, is tearmde the Lilly white. If this be false, blame Ouid then, that such a tale would write. But if it had beene true, when he so sore was greeued, Had he but come vnto this Spring, he had beene soone releeued: For in this Spring he should haue seene no shadowes of a face, But such a face as should in deede his owne so much disgrace, That he should haue forgotte his owne, if this he once did see. Now he that doth desire to know wher this same Spring should be: In Suffolke soyle, who so best list, let him I say go seeke: And he may hap to see a Spring he neuer saw the leeke. [A prety Tale of late I heard] A Gentleman on a time, hauing three Sonnes: and being very desirous to haue them brought vp at an Universitie: being very well acquainted with a yong Gentleman, who he knew had spent some yeares at Oxford, desyred him to choose a Tutor there, for his three Children, which as he thought were fyttest to bring them vp as well in learning as good behaviour: which he was contented to doe: and hauing chosen a Tutor for them, not long after, hauing a great desire to see them doo well, wrote their Tutor a Letter, and with the Letter a pretty Tale in verse, to mooue him to haue a great care of them: the Letter I let alone: but the tale I haue thought good to shew forth among these prety Toyes, as one not the worste: which tale was as followeth. A little Preface before the Tale. A prety Tale of late I heard, a learned wise man tell: Wherto I gaue attentiue eare, and markte it very well: Touching the bringing vp of youth, and who were fittest men, In learning and good quallities, to bring vp children. Which Tale, when I had heard told out, of troth, it likte me so, That to the like, I were content againe ten myles to go. Well: as it was, I did full ofte reuolve the same in minde: And many prety poincts therein I many tymes did finde. And as one day vnto my selfe, by chaunce, I did rehearse Eche poinct therein, I tooke my Penne and put it into verse. Which Tale so pend, according to my simple skill, I send To you: for dyvers causes Syr: first, for that it doth tend Vnto a little matter, that there is twixt you and me: It hath (I trow) somwhat respect, vnto the Children three: The three yong Gentlemen, which to you, as my friend, I gaue in charge, to rule and teach: and so I make an end. The Tale followeth in this manner. A gentleman, that had two sonnes, desirous was to see Them both in learning traded up: for which, great counsale hee, Of diuers often did require, what Tutors he might choose To put these prety Puples too, that rightly might them vse. And vnder whom they likely were their labours to haue lost. Well: to be breefe, so many men so many mindes there were: Some would say this, some other that, &amp; som were here, som there. Some sayd, they thought that liberty was ill for Children: Some other sayd, that lawfull twas and needefull, now and then: Some sayd, the rod should be the sword, to keepe Children in awe: And other some, such cruelty counted not worth a strawe. Some sayd, that Children should surpressed be by feare: Some thought, to rule by gentlenesse, a better way it were. Some said, that children were by nature bent to play, Which from their learning, in short space, will drawe them soone away: Fro which, by feare to keepe them still, the rod should be the meane: Least little smack of liberty would quickly marre them cleane: And vse would make great masteries, for so, by keeping in And harde applying of their bookes, they profite would therein. Some other then, that thorowly this matter did discusse, To that opinion contrary, alleadged reason thus: Children, by nature, are not bent to any kinde of play; Their minds are eu? halfe made by th? that gouerne them alway: And that, to keepe their minds fr? play, the rod should be no meane; And that by feare for to subdue, that were not worth a beane. As for examples sake, (quoth one) at first, take me a Childe, Who hath a prety ready wit, although of nature wilde: And let him learne to daunce, to shoote, and play at ball, And any other sporte: but put him to his booke withall: And when he is abroade, if fayre he doo not shoote, Or when he gins to daunce, if false he chaunce to foote, Then pay him, breech him thorowly, favour him not at all: And now and then correct him well, though for a fault but small. If that he trip, or misse his time, vp with him, by and by: Let him not slip with such a fault, but pay him presently. And you shall see that ofte, for feare, his legges will quiuer so, That he shall neuer learne to daunce, nor scarcely well to go. And when in feeld he drawes not cleane, his arrow in his bowe, Knock him vpon the fingers harde: and you shall see, I trow, That in a while his fyngers ends, for feare will quiuer so, That he will neuer learne aright, to let his Arrow go. Now if he be harde at his booke, although he learne not well, Either forget, or conster false: at fyrst, doo gently tell Him of his faulte, and if that he do plye it harde, Giue him an Apple or a Peare, or some such childes rewarde: And trust me, you shall see, the schoole shall be his chiefe delight: And from his booke he seeld will be, or neuer, if he might. Wherefore, by reason thus I prooue, that children be not bent, But that their natures much are made by Tutors gouernment. But this I graunt as requisite, with reason to correct: Lest children oft for lacke thereof, their faults too much neglect. But as a sworde, to set it vp in schoole to open sight, I like not that: for tis to some at fyrst to great a fright. Their eyes are so vpon the rodde, they little minde their booke: For childish feare will cause them still upon the Rodde to looke: And so their eyes quite from their bookes not only drawes away, But eke their minds, as much and more then any kinde of play: Wherefore a Rod I would in schooles should be kept out of sight, To make the Children to their bookes to haue a more delight. Another graue gray headed syre, that harde them reason so, Thus said: So many shrewd curst boyes, &amp; w?ton wags I know, And eke so many Schoolemaisters, that lack good gouernment, That many prety Boyes will mar, that are of minds well bent: That sure I know not what to say, but, trust me, in my minde, A good Tutor, whereto a child is bent, can quickly finde; And as he findes the nature of the Childe, euen so he may, By gentle meanes, euen as he list, soone leade him euery way. So, that to keepe him in good awe, correction, now and than, He iustly use with gentlenesse, as a good Tutor can. Well: at the last, this Gentleman, when he had heard at large Their true oppinions euery one, at last, he gaue in charge His two Sonnes to two sundry men: whereof the one was milde, And euer sought by gentle meanes for to bring vp a Childe: The other was of nature fierce, and, therefore, rather sought With store of stripes for to bring vp such children as he taught. The children both of nature like, in time did differ much; The difference of gouernment, of Tutors, theirs was such. The one did prooue a proper Youth, and learned for his time: And by his learning afterward, to honour high did clyme. This, was by him brought vp, that was of nature milde, And euer sought by gentle meanes, for to bring vp a Childe. The other prooued but a blocke, a Dunsicus, an Asse: Because, with too much cruelty, he often dulled was. This, was brought vp by him that was so fierce of minde: That thought the Rod should be the sword, to rule a child by kinde. The Father sory, afterward, to see his Child so lost: And seeing, that his other sonne, did euer profite most: Tooke him away from that fierce foole, and put him presently To him that was the mylder man, praying him, earnestly, To see if that he could in time, quicken his dulled wit: Desiring him thereto to vse such meanes as he thought fyt. Well: at the last, with much adoe he tooke a little paine: And tooke in hand to sharpen then, his dulled braine againe: And many maisteries did prooue, but rigour none he vsde: For that before he had so much by thother ben abusde: But euer sought, by gentle meanes, to make him voide of feare; And so in time did alter much, his nature as it were. He made him boulder to his booke, therefore, more willing to His study still: but yet, alas, whateuer he could doe, He could not make him like vnto his brother any way: Although he striu'de, and tooke great pains, asmuch as in him lay: Yet euery way he mended had, his nature very much: The gentle meanes, he euer vsde in teaching him, were such. Well: to be short, when that this Gentleman did see, The difference twixt his two sons: There shall no more, quoth he, Of children mine be put to Schoole to such as still doo vse To rule the Children by the rod: I rather aie will chuse To put my children vnto those, that are of nature milde, And know by loue and gentlenesse, how to bringe vp a childe. And thus the tale was at an ende. and now, Sir, euen as he, The Gentleman that had two sonnes, desirous was to see Them both in learning traded vp: euen so, no lesse, am I Desirous for to see these youthes, bothe learnedly And vertuously brought vp, as much as if they were The neerest kinsmen that I haue, or brethren deere, I sweare. Wherefore, good Syr, as I in you my faithfull trust repose: Vouchsafe to take such pains with them. that they no time do lose: And for correction, now and than, to him that dooth not well, I meane not to instruct you Sir: your selfe can better tell Then I, what longs thereto: therefore, as you shall finde, Vse your discretion Sir, therein according to your minde. Thus you haue heard the milder man the better Scholler made: And yet, a bridell must be had, for a wilde brainesicke Jade. But for your prety Coltes, I hope, no bridle you shall neede: I hope you easely shall them bende, with a small twined threed. My meaning is, I hope they will themselues eche order so, That you shall neede to take small care almost which way they go. Yet now and then, though without neede, somwhat looke out, I pray: Least that they hap by Company for to be led astray. For though their natures well be bent, yet you know, now &amp; than, Ill company oft times, God wot, dooth marre an honest man: And they, you know, are all but young, and youth delights in toyes, And toyes fr? learning quite &amp; clean, withdraweth wanton boyes. Yet in good faith, I hope, good Syr, your prety Puples three, Will bothe in learning, and all things, by you so ruled be: And eke vnto their bookes, besides, will haue so great desire: That earnest more, or dilligent, you cannot well require. Well: I haue put them all to you, you only must be he, That as well to their learning, as behauiour must see. I sought not out three sundry men, to put these children too, To see which of them would doo best, and which againe would do Worst of the three: but all vnto your charge I doo commit, To teache and gouerne, by such meanes, as you alone thinke fit. And as I haue them giuen in charge to you, euen so I craue That you will see your Schollers so, themselues each way behaue; And bring them vp in learning so, that when from you they part, I to haue found a Tutor such, first will be glad in heart: And you your selfe another day, may be full glad to see Their vertuous life, &amp; then may say, these were brought vp by me. Their Father then, whose tender care is for to see them all, In learning daily to succeede, and further there withall In good behaviour eke, may well in hart reioyce: That I in this behalfe haue made so good and happy choice, As to finde out, so fit a man, to put his children too. As vnder whom, they all in time, so will are like to doe. And I my selfe, the more for that, may stande your bounden friend: And he reward you for your paines: and so I make an ende. TWO OR THREE PRETY TOYES giuen to a Gentilman, to set about his Counting-house. What man can beare a lofty saile, Where fortune frownes, and friends doo faile? And who so low, but he may rise, By fortunes aide, and friends aduise? What wo to hate? what ioye to love? What stranger state, then both to prooue? What treasure, to a friend in deede? What greater spight, then faile at neede? What wisdome more, then for to learne The trueth from falshood to discerne? From which false dealing God defend Those that meane well: and so I end. [Pitie, oh Lord thy Servaunts heavy heart] A Gentleman being requested by a Gentlewoman, to pen her a Prayer in verse, wrot at her request, as followeth. Pitie, oh Lord thy Servaunts heavy heart, Her sinnes forgiue, that thus for mercy cryes: Judge no man (Lorde) according to desart, Let fall on her with speede thy healthfull eyes: In hart who prayes to thee continually, Putting her only trust of God in Thee. Lorde, Lorde, to thee for mercy still I call, Oh, set me free, that thus am bound and thrall. [Plant Lorde, in me the tree of godly lyfe] Not many dayes after, he chaunced to walke with the same Gentilwoman in a Garden: and was againe then intreated by her, to make her another prayer, which presently he pend: speaking with the tearmes of a Gardiner, as followeth. Plant Lorde, in me the tree of godly lyfe, Hedge me about with thy stronge fence of faith: If thee it please, vse eke thy proyning knife, Least that, oh Lord, as a good Gardiner saith: If suckers draw the sappe from bowes on hie, Perhaps in tyme the top of tree may die. Let, Lord, this tree be set within thy Garden wall Of Paradise, where growes no one ill sprig at all. A pretty toye, written vpon a Ladyes propounding of a Riddle to her friende. A lady once, in pleasaunt sorte, A question did demaunde of mee, For want as then of other sporte: Without offence, good Sir (quod she): May I craue thus much at your hande, To haue a riddle rightly scand? Whereto I soone gaue this replye: Madame, you know full harde it is To reade a Riddle perfectly; The wisest men may iudge amisse. But shew the effect of your request, And you shall see me doo my best. THE RIDDLE. Why then, a thing there is, quod she, That breedeth many, deadly smart: Which none can feele, nor heere, nor see, And yet with greefe consumes the heart: For which is founde none other ease, But euen the cause of the disease: Now this is my desire, (quoth she) To be resolv'de what this may be? THE ANSWER. These doubts (Madame) quod I, to skan, Requires some time, and that not small: They trouble would a wiser man Then I, by roode, to deale withall. But yet, faire Dame, the doubt of this I hope to finde, and not to misse: I can but gesse vpon a doubt, I will not sweare to find it out. But as I judge, Madam, quod I, It seemes Appollos sicknesse sure, On whom he cryed piteously, That neuer any herbe could cure: Nor any Phisicke finde releefe, To helpe or ease him of his greefe: Which plainly, Madam, for to name, Is lucklesse loue, Dame Venus game. Which spightfull sporte for to attaine Some so doo dull their sences all: That in the ende, with to much paine They doo become sore sicke with all: And so remaine, vntill they haue Some players such as they doo craue. For euery Player cannot please Eche pacient to playe with all: For then, to cure his straunge disease, He some should haue soone at his call: But he must haue whom eche would craue, Els he, poore soule, small rest shall haue. This Madam, for ought I can see, The meaning of your doubt must be: Which, if you like not, good Madam, Let it euen passe from whence it came. My Lady lawght: Is loue, quod she, A spight and sporte, to both at ones? Now thou hast giuen me, credit me, A resolution, for the nones: Tis loue, in deede: thou hast founde out The misterie of all my doubt: And for thy paines, as to a friend, I yeelde thee thancks:—and there an end. [First, to thy seemely selfe] A Letter sent vnto a Gentilwoman in verse, wherein he gaue great thanks for both good cheere and other curteous entertainement he had receiued at her hands, beeing in the Country at her house. The Gentilwomans name was Mistris Lettis. First, to thy seemely selfe, my selfe I doo commend: And for thy friendly cheere &amp; cost ten thousand thanks I send: Which able to requite, I know I shall not be: But to my power, I will deserue as much as lyes in me. But yet, of all thy cates, one dish aboue the rest I euer since doo beare in minde, which fare dooth like me best: Which deinty dish (my deare,) If I mought plainly name, Lettys it is, a houlsome hearbe: thyselfe doost know the same. An herbe that we haue here: but yet I plainely finde That Lettys, from our Lettys heere, dooth much digresse in kinde: For in that Lettys, such vertues soone I found, As fewe or none the like, I finde, dooth grow vpon our ground: This Lettys sweete art thou, in which I so delight: And God he knows what griefs I bide, for wanting of thy sight. No cates, that I can taste, but seeme all gall to me: When that in minde I feede vpon the fresh recorde of thee: And so, my Lettys sweete, vnto thy selfe farewell! And thinck no cates like Lettys fine, can like me halfe so well. A Riddle propounded by a Gentleman to a Gentilwoman whom he loued, but was a suter, but secretly. The thing on earth you most desire, and yet of all you lest would chuse: That often times you doo require, and yet I know you will refuse: And that here present you may see All this is one: what may it be? Her aunswer, as prety. Good Sir, the selfe same thing that you aboue all things doo most esteeme: And that in deede is present now, and to your selfe you deerest deeme: That doo you take it, out of doubt, That I would chuse, yet be without. [Perhaps you thinke, that all for spight] A Ditty in despight of a very olde man, who was suter to a very young Gentilwoman: written by a young Gentilman, who was then (in deede) suter to the same Lady. Perhaps you thinke, that all for spight I writ this running verse, Wherein I doo such deepe dispraise of doting fooles rehearse: No, no (good faith) I hate no man: but yet, to such a snudge, Of force I must, I cannot chuse, but beare a certaine grudge. For as one way I honour age, so such olde doting doltes, That, at the age of three score yeares, would faine seeme but young coltes: Those crusty chaps I cannot loue, the Diuell doo them shame: God let them neuer haue good lucke of any noble Dame, Much lesse th[e] loue: alas, my heart, it rendes for very greefe, To thinke vpon the crabbed crust, that vile old doting theefe, That seekes to robbe thee of all ioyes, and me of my delight: Wo woorth that so shall seeke, to winne a worthy wight: And seeme to match a miching Carle with such a pearlesse peece, As neuer yet, Appelles fine, could paint the like in Greece. Well, well, this is the world, (we see) tis money makes the man, Yet shall not money make him yong againe, doo what he can: No, nor yet honest sure, I iudge, nay more, for troth I know, The older still, the more in crafte, his braines he dooth bestow. And crafte and Knauery commonly, with crooked crabbed age, With Auaryce and Jelosy, dooth make a mariage. These are the fruites of froward age, which thou shalt reape, God wot: When thou wilt say, oh, had I wist, in faith then would I not. Well, say not yet but thou art warnde, by him that likes thee well, Thou comber not thy comly corps, with such a Coystrel: Whose crusty chaps, whose Aly nose, whose lothsom stinking breath, Whose toothles gumms, whose bristled beard, whose visage, all like death, Would kill an honest wench to view: and so it will doo thee, If so thou hap to match thy selfe with such a snudge as he. My counsaile therefore follow, wench, cast of the crabbed knaue: And henceforth, not one merry word, ne looke yet let him haue: But frowne vpon the froward foole, and when thou seest him glad, Knit thou thy browes, hang down thy head, &amp; then seeme y? most sad. As who would say, the crabbed lookes of his old doting age Of force you know must needes offend, a youthfull personage: Let therfore crummes, as fyttest is, with crustes then linked be: For trust to this, that like to like, will euer best agree. A prety Toye in rime. MISERO INFORTUNATO SOLO: LAMENTING HIS EUILL HAPPE, IN DISPAYRE OF HELPE. Wh? purse grows pild, &amp; credit cracks, &amp; friends begin to faile, To comfort then a heauy heart, alas, what may prevaile? Audita vox confortans. Yet doo not thou dispayre at all, but comfort thou thy minde: Though credit, purse, &amp; friends be gone, somwhat is left behinde. Misero. Somewhat, alas, oh, tell me now, what somwhat that may be: That so in this my deepe distresse, is left to comfort me. Vox. Why doost thou craue to know the thing wherof y? canst not doubt? Necessity ere long, I wis, will make thee finde it out. Misero. Necessitie, alas, I see, too ready is at hand: Yet can I not, doo what I can, thy meaning vnderstand. Vox. Why? doste thou not thy selfe assure, there is no mallady, But physick hath in store for it, some kinde of remedy. Misero. No, credit me, I feare there is no meane to cure my greefe: If there be any, let me craue how I may find releefe. Vox. Wylt thou doo as I bid thee doo? and thou shalt soone finde ease: Although thou be not at the first, quite rid of thy disease. Misero. If that thy counsaile well I like, I will agree thereto: To ease my heart of this despayre, I care not what to doo. Vox. Haue patience then, rage not to much, let reason rule thy minde: And be thou sure, in little time, some comfort for to finde. Misero. But pacience dooth come perforce: and what is forst (God wot) Dooth more and more torment the minde: then pacience easeth not. Vox. Yet pacience procureth hope, and hope driues out dispaire: And where Dispaire is driuen away, there comfort dooth repayre. Misero. Oh, but hope oftentimes is vaine, and dooth deceiue the minde: Therefore, in hope I thinke, alas, but comfort small to finde. Vox. Let hope then grow by due desart, then followes good successe: For reason showes, who seekes for ease, shal some way finde redresse. Misero. Oh, but alas, those dayes be past for to reward desart: And that the more, dooth cause dispayre, for to torment my heart. Vox. What though such daies are past, in deede, yet daies wil come again, Wherein desarts shall reape desyre, and pleasure win for paine. Misero. But while the grasse dooth grow, oft times the silly steede he sterues: And he, God wot, shall reape small gaine, in only hope, that serues. Vox. Yet serue in hope, and hope in God, and seeke well to deserue: And let the Horse doo what he list, be sure thou shalt not sterue. Misero. Now like I well this lesson thine, God well in heart to serue: For he, in deede, who hope in him, will neuer let them sterue. [Needs must I write, &amp; know not what] A Gentleman beeing in his friends house, in the Country, was by him earnestly intreated after Dinner, before his departure, to make him some verses. But would giue him no theame to write vpon: he, not knowing what to write that best mought like his fancie, yet willing to graunt his request, wrote as followeth. Needs must I write, &amp; know not what: why then euen as it is, Accept the same, and blame me not, if ought you find amis. On bushy bankes what else, but thornes and bryars grow? What looke you for, but raine, when stormy winds gin blowe? What looke you for, of me, some learned kinde of verse? You are deceaude: I cannot I, but ragged rimes rehearse. But what? me thinkes you say, I make too much adoo, Considering how little yet, I haue done hetherto: And since I graunted haue so little time to write, Some pithy shorter sentence, would a wiser man indite. In deede syr, true it is, my fault I do confesse, And since I haue no longer time my meaning to expresse, Remaine in doubt what I would doo, if I had longer time: And so, with thanks for my good cheare, I rudely end my rime. But if so be you haue some prety kinde of stile, Whereon you doo desire some verse, if you will stay a while, A day or two, or so, or till I come againe, Then you shall see, that I in time will temper so my braine, And whet my wittes a new, that I will promise you, Some prety peece of verse thereon, more then I can doo now. And thus, I leaue you here, vntil I come againe, This rude and ragged rime to reade: and so, in rest remaine. Verses made upon this Theame: Little medling, breedes mickle rest. My youthfull yeares are spent, old age comes stealing on, And bids me now, fond Fancies fits, no more to thinke vpon. Of worthy Wisdome I, some lessons now haue learnde, Whereby the difference twixt wit and will, I haue discernde: Among all which, this one, where euer so I be, To keepe still secrete to my selfe what so I here or see. Which, since of lessons all I doo not count the worst, I doo intend his graue aduise, in this to follow first. Fyrst in thy selfe, quoth he, all faults thou must amend, Before in other men thou seeke, one fault to reprehend. Of Cato eke I learnd, it is no little shame, To find that fault in other men, wherein I am to blame. To hold my peace, therefore, I count it alwayes best: And keep in minde the old sayd saw, thereof comes mickle rest. I see a flattering knaue is set by, now and then, Of greatest heads, as much and more, then twenty honest men: But let me rue the same, since I cannot amende it: I mought a witlesse foole be thought to seeke to reprehend it. Some Lawyer sees, at fyrst, which way the case will go: Although he list not, at the fyrst, to tell his Clyent so: But what meanes he by that? alas, doo you not see, Your pence may make you picke it out, and so they shall, for me. What boote were it, for me, their meaning to betray: And so, no profite to my selfe, to take their gaines away? The Marchaunt man he sees too, syr, by your hye lusty lookes, That shortly he shall finde your hand. deep in his reckening bookes. Bids he you then beware betimes, of had I wist? No, no, but lets you lash it out as long syr, as you list. Or as you can, at least: and if you aske me why, He will no better counsaile giue, and what he meanes thereby? Your losse of Lands, ere long, shall learne you how to know, As well as I can teach you Syr, and better too, I trow. And so shall I offend the Marchaunts nere a whit, By showing of their silken snares, that in their shops doo sit. Your Tenaunt too he sees, that by your trim gay Coates, Some Lease is shortly to be let, then gets he vp his Groates: And purseth vp his pence, and coms with coyne in hande To craue of your good Maystership, to hyre a peece of Lande. And wot you wherefore Syr, your Farmer finds this feate? To come with Coyne, ready in hand, your freenship to intreate: When that your goods are gone, and you the losse doo see Of brainsick bargaines made in haste, to maintaine brauery: The smart thereof, at last, shall shew you then their shiftes: Then shall you easely discerne, their double dealing driftes: Which I dare not descry, I am so chargde, you see, To make no words of any thing, what euer so it be. Your servaunt last he sees, your feathers gin to fall, And sees your Farmer buy you out, of house and land and all. No longer then he likes your seruice Syr, adew, And if you meane to keepe a man. you must go seek a new. And aske you me by this, what may his meaning be? Sure, if you see it not your selfe. you shall not know for me. As for the higher powers, they are too high for me: What faults are to be found in them, I list not seeke to see: Let finde their faults themselues, so shall they best be pleasde: And for my silence, I am sure I shall not be diseasde. But to the rest againe, that are of meaner sorte; Of their fine fetches, secretly, I somewhat will reporte: For openly, God wot, I nothing dare descry: Who hurts not me, nor yet my friends, I will not hurt them, I. But they who doo me harme, I doo not meane to spare: To bid my friends in each respect, of such for to beware. From Cittizens to Clownes, what secret shifte they haue: It is a sport to see a Clowne how he can play the Knaue. The Badger fyrst, one Knaue that hunts the market place, When Corne is cheape, to buy good store. now therby lyes a case. What should he mean by that? oh syr, when corne growes deere, I need not tell you what he means, your selfe shall know next yere. The toleyng Myller then, when he hath tollde his sacke, He findes a trade to fill it vp, if any meale doo lacke. Now what meanes he by this? this feate how dooth he frame? The Milstones greete among y? meale, wil make you finde the same. The Baker then, that sees that meale dooth grow so deare, He findes a shyfte to hold his gaines, how euer goe the yeare. But what is that his shifte? the Bakers man can tell, And I say nought, but little loaues will show it pretely well. Some other crabbed Carles, of canckred cutthroates kinde, That buy whole groaues of woods at once: and shal I speak my mind, What they doo meane thereby? oh no sir, by the roode, The Collier &amp; the poore man knowes, when they do buy their wood. The Collyer yet to gaine, will play the craftie Clowne: He works a knack, yet in his sack, when coales doo come to towne: But how he works that shifte, I pray you aske not me: But wh? you see him shoote his coales, th? marke what dust you see. Another sort of clownes there are that liue by buying corne, That secretly vse knauish shiftes, that are not to be borne: And these are Maltmen cald: but what their shiftes should be, I need not tell, by speered Mault the Bruer soone will see. The Bruer then, he findes a shifte, to make a gaine: But what is that? small drinke (alas) doth show it too too plaine. Another sort of Clownes there are, that droauers are by name: That Heards of Cattell buy at once: what meane they by the same? Oh syr, although I know, I must not say my minde: But when the poore man buyes a Cow, then he the cause shall [finde.] Another sort there are, which some doo Grasiers call: And for their secret kinde of gaine, they are not least of all: But how they make theyr gaine, I list not to descrie, The Butcher, when he Buyes his Beefes, he better knowes th? I. The Butcher too againe, he is no foole, I trowe: He findes deuice to make a gaine, how euer Cattell go. But shall I tell you how? oh sir, I must not, I: But marke you price &amp; Butchers weight, your Beefe when you do buy. The Chaundler then, y? of the Butcher Tallow buies: If he buy deere, then wyll he worke a feate in secret wise, To make a secret gaine: but what feate may that be I dare say nought, but some the same by watry lights may see. Some wealthy fellowes are, that trauell here and [t]here, And buy up almost all the Wooll they can get euery where: And doo you seeke to know what they may meane by that? The Draper, when you buy your Cloth, can quickly tell you what. Tush, many such things moe, I see ofte times, God wot, Which I would helpe too if I could, but (alas) I cannot. Therefore, since I cannot, I thinke it alwayes best, To take good heede and hold my peace, for scilence breeds much rest. If Scilence, then, breede rest, why haue I pratled so? Yet haue I nothing saide, I hope, whereof just grutch may grow. But if against my will I any doo offend, I pardon craue, I spake in sporte, and so I make an ende. The iust will liue upright, and make an honest gaine: And if I thinke to mend a knaue, my labour is in vaine. But honest men, or els what euer so they be, Let Countrey, Prince, and freends alone, and let them be for me. But he that wisheth ill, to Countrey, Prince and freend, I will not keepe his counsaile sure, but rather seeke his ende: But els, as I am warnde, so doo I thinke it best, To medle little any way, and so to liue at rest. A solempne and repentant Prayer, for former life mispent. Oh heavenly Lord, who plain doost see y? thoughts of ech m?s heart: Who sendest some continuall plague, &amp; some release of smart: Pittie, O Lorde, the wofull state, wherein I dayly stand, And onely for thy mercies sake, now helpe me, out of hande. And as it was thy pleasure fyrst, to plague me thus with greefe: So canst thou, Lorde, if thee it please, with speede send me releefe. I must of force confesse, O Lorde, I can it not denye, That I deserue these plagues and worse, and that continually: Yet doo not thou therefore on me thy Judgements iust extend: But pardon me, and graunt me grace my life for to amend. And banish (Lord) from me, delights of worldly vanitie, And lend me helpe, to pace the pathes, of perfect pietie. And truely so to treade the pathes, and in such godly wise, That they may bring me to the place, of perfect paradice: And not to wander vp and downe, in wayes of weary wo, Where wicked wily wanton toyes, do leade me too and fro: The Sap of Sapience likes me not, that pleaseth not my taste: But fonde delight, that wicked weede, was all my chiefe repaste: Wherein, as hooke within the baight, so doo I plainly finde Some hidden poyson lurking lyes, for to infect my minde: But wherefore doo I finde it now? because, I now doo see That, wanting smart, I wanted grace, for to acknowledge thee. But now, O Lorde, that I so sore doo feele thy punishment: I doo lament my folly great, and all my sinnes repent: And to thy heauenly throane, O Lord, for mercy I appeale, To send me (Lord) some heau?ly salue, my greevous sores to heale. Beholde, O Lord, my sorrowes such, as no man dooth endure: And eke, my greevous sicknesse such as none but thou canst cure: And as thou art a gratious God, to men in misery, So pitty me, that thus (O Lord) doo pine in penurie: And as thou art a help to all that put their trust in thee: So (luld in this my deepe distresse) some comfort lend to me. And hold, O Lord, thy heauy hand, and lay thy scourge aside: For (Lord) the greevous smart thereof, I can no longer bide. Forgiue my sinnes, forget the same, beholde my humble heart, Who, onely Lord, doo trust in thee, for to releeue my smart: And after this my wretched life: Lord, graunt me, of thy grace, That I in heauen, at latter daye, may haue a ioyfull place.

From all those courses of a vaine conceit Where vertue proues her honor hath no place, Vnto the Sunne of that bright shining heighte: Where all the graces haue their highest grace, My Muse is weande by wisedomes sounde aduise, To make her pilgrimage, to paradise. Which pilgrimage, is not, as poets faine Nor pieuish people, blindely doe conceiue: A kinde of walke, that worldly wealth may gaine, Whereby the deuill, doth the worlde deceiue: But, tis a walke, of onely vertues will, And to be founde, but by the spirits skill. Now, they that must this trauaile take in hande, Are onely fiue, ech differente in theire nature, Which, with consent, doe all contented stand, To yeeld theire seruice, to one onely creature: By whom they are vnto theire comforte led: And, as hee fares, are found, aliue or dead. Now lies this walke, alonge a wildernes, A forrest, ful of wild, and cruell beastes: The earth vntilde, the fruit vnhappines, The trees all hollow, full of howletes nestes, The aier vnholsome, or so foule infected: As, hardely restes, that may not be reiected. But to goe on with my intended tale Fiue seruants, ledde by one chiefe lord, there were: Which, all were sworne in either blisse, or bale, Their masters fortune, faithfully to beare: And so resolu'de, to see, their seruice done, On gods good speed their trauaile thus begonne. The lorde and Master, first the Muses called, And bad them stay, their straying kinde of Musing: Whose pure conceite, their spirits so apalled, As made them haue, their humors in refusing: And make their state, but on that only story, That was the grace, of their eternall glory. Then gaue a charge to euery one, aparte, To keepe the compasse of a true conceite: What euery one should haue for her desart, That, to her hope, could keepe the high waie streight: And then his seruants, soundely did aduise, How they shoulde finde the path to paradise. The first, his charge, was onely but to see, What best might please, and what might worst offend: What obiects might but all as abiects be, What harme to scape, what honour to attende: Afarre, neare hand, each side, before, behinde, How best to guide a pure, and perfect minde. The seconde calde, his charge was but to heare, In sweetest sounds, which was the soundest sweete: What graces might, in Musickes grounde appeare, And where the honors of the humors meete: What carefull notes, doe comfort best conclude, While Sirens songes, doe but the soule delude. The third then calde, was charg'd to take the sent. Of euery flower and herbe, within the fielde: Which might but grow whereas their graces went, What fauoure might, the sweetest profit yeelde: And what might hurt, least that the braine displeased. The body might perhaps be all diseased. The fourth then calde, did take his charge, to tast, Of euery fruite, that should become their foode: What beast might nourish, and might sweetest last, And, in their trauaile most might doe them good: How sweete with sower, might best be tempred so. As t'one the tother might not well forgoe. Then came the fifte, who tooke his charge to feele, The grauelde causey from the hollow grounde: How best the toe, might trust vnto the heele, When settled faith had surest footing founde: And so by leasure finde, where sweetely lies, The louely path, that leades to paradise. When thus ech one, had learnèd what to doe, Instructed by the guide vnto their grace: Weying the worth, they were to walke vnto, Wishing, and longing, to beholde the place. Onwards they passe, but with two poore attendauntes, And, (on the earth) but with two poore defendauntes. Their cariage was, but an vnwildy trunke, Wherein to neare their trash, was laied their treasure, With weight whereof, their shoulders often thruncke, Before they came, vnto their place of pleasure. But let that passe, vntill the time be cumme To make the reckening of a Roial summe. But to goe on as I did first intend, To tell the course of these resoluèd creatures, To take a trauaile, that should neuer ende, A note, aboue the reache of earthly natures: Lo, thus it was, at least as he did write, That seemde he winckt not, when he hit the white. Along the walke, the walke, alas to long, Amidde the haples hils, and dolefull dales: Where sighes and sobs, doe sound but sorrows song, While sweetest truthes are crost by sorie tales: And darkest cloudes, are clapt before the sunne, These wary creatures, haue their waie begunne. A path vnpleasant where no pleasure was, That earthly people easely might perceiue: A passage harde, and narrow for to passe, But for the life, that of his life tooke leaue: To passe the lake where death, and sorrow lies, And kill them both to come to paradise. Wherein no sooner were they all set forth, With resolution neuer to returne: There did appeare a light of little worth, A mocking ioie, whose ende was but to morne: Vpon the left hand, of this selly creature, Venus, faire painted with her finest feature. Who, wanting nothing that might wel adorne A cunning dame, to compasse her desire: With looke askaunce, as if shee had in scorne, A meaner hope, then might a heauen aspire: With strange deuises of a world of toies, Would stoope his passage to his further ioies. And vp she standes a tipto, in her state, As, if the earth too base were for her feete: With such a glaunce, as if shee had in hate, That lesse then Monarches, should her presence meete: When, with such smiles, so neare this walke she went, As made them wonder what the vision ment. When he, that first had taken charge to view, What might their trauaile hinder or auaile: Finding that in his sight a dimnes grew, Whereby the cleernes of his sence might faile: Feeling the humor, growe vnto an itche, Beganne to feare the wonder was a witch. When of the sodaine, holding vp his hande, Betwixte his sight, and this same perlous thing: Hauing no leasure, on his thoughtes to stande, What issue would, of this ill humor spring, Went on alonge and kepte his walke aright, Vntill this vision vanisht out of sight. When on the right hand fourthwith did appeare, Diana, shee of whom the poets writ: A dame of state, yet with such smiling cheere, As shewd, where kindenes did with honor sit: Who with her nimphes, appareld all in white, Did seeme to pure an obiect for his sight. When fearing, that the poets did not faine, That did set forth Diana for diuine: When in her Beauty was so bright a vaine, As seemde, that Phœbus on her face did shine: Betwixt his sight, and this conceiuèd sunne, Helde vp his hande, ere any hurte was donne. And thus betwixt first Venus then Diane, Onwardes he goes, his right intended way, And noting well what he had vndertane, And that a stoppe might cause to longe a staie, Keeping the path, looking on neither side, He followes on his best belouèd guide. When, walking on, his hopèd happy way, Vpon the left hande rose a sodaine sounde, Which might haue beene a most vnhappy staie, But that a sodaine remedy was found, For he that knew her Musicke was a charme, His hearing stopt, for feare of further harme. And this was he that had the charge to heare, And harken soundly to each secret sounde. What noise might not by any meanes cum neare, And where the Muses soone woulde be aground, Who hauing heard but how her harpe was stronge, Would not vouchsafe the hearing of her songe. But when shee saw how hardly shee was vsed, Her Beauty first barde from the walke of blisse, And then her Musicke so in skorne refused, As idle noise, wherein no honor is, Awaie shee went all angry as shee was, And left the poore man, on his waie to passe. When, on the right hand of the sodeine rose, An other sound, but of a deeper sweete, Where sure Diana, with her Nimphes had chose The ground of grace where all the Muses meete, To shew the world the heauenly harmony, Where Nightingales, doe make a company. When hee that heard the sweetnes of the sound, Fearing what hurt might quickly growe vpon it, If once his Muse, vnhapply might be drownde, In worldes delight, ere wit had ouergonne it. The hearing stopt, of his vnworthy sence: Of such a sound, of such an excellence. But when Diana plainly gan to find, That one of all the world, had warning tooke: For comming neere vnto Acteons kinde, And that her siluer sound was so forsooke, Away shee went, but yet, with this sweet blessing, Vertue is plac'd where pride may not be pressing. When these were gon, that might haue stopte his waie, Had he not kepte the course of better care, A new devise, againe to breede his staie, Came Flora forth, with all hir fairest ware, Laying abroad the wardrope of her wealth, Her fairest flowers, and fittest herbes for health. But he that had the charge to take the sente, Of euerie sauoure, both the sower and sweete, Knowing what best might comforte or contente, How, weedes were all to tread but vnder feete, The holsome sauoure to his seruice vsed, And faire flourd weedes, as poison foule refused. But when that Flora, saw her great disgrace: Witherèd with griefe, she shrunke into the ground, And, (as it seemed) displeasèd with the place, For that so little fauour their she found: She lets him goe, vntill anone he met, An other Lady, with an other let. And this was she, of whom the Poets writ, Ceres the Princes of the Pesaunts treasure, Who both for tast, and eke for hunger fit, Did onely worke, but for the bellies pleasure: Who, with a cornu copia, sweetely dight, Would staie the spirit with the flesh delight. But he that had the charge, to take a tast Of every fruit, whereon they were to feede, What soone would rot, and what would longest last, And what would proue the sweetest foode indeede: Vpon his lippe his little finger plas't: As if her gift were vtterly disgras't. Not that the present seemèd of no price, But that their comforts were of other kinde, And that (God wot) it was a base deuise, With belly pleasures to abuse the minde: Which Ceres seeing, parted in a rage, And left the pilgrime to his pilgrimage. Which, selly creature, softly going on, Encountred with more crosses than before: A world of fooles, and deuils many a one. In shape of men, in shape, and somewhat more: Which labourd sore, to make some stoppe, or stay, To hinder loue, in hitting vertues waie. But he, whose charge, was charily to feele, What grounde was best to grounde his footing on: Spurnde with his toe, and kickt of with his heele, Their stumbling stones, till all the stops were gone: Which, when they saw, his blisse they could not balke, They ranne away, and left him to his walke. By which good howre, when heauens had happly tried, How constant care, his passage, truely past: And in the harte, no vile desire did bide, While patient will, was with discretion plac't: They rockt the rules of nature sence asleepe, While Angels songs, the soule did waking keepe. But, waking wit, that had no will to rest, Till ioie might come, vnto her iourneies ende: And that the spirit was not fully blest, Till humble faith, might see her heauenly friende Awakte this pilgrime, from his pensiue vaine, And set him sweetely on his waie againe. When, passing on, they fell into a wood, A thicket full of brambles, thornes, and briers: A graceles groue, that neuer did man good, But wretched endinges of the worldes desires: Where Snakes, and Adders, and such venumd things, Had slaine a number, with their cruell stinges. Some, Metamorphosde, like Acteon, were, Diana smiling at their lewde desires: Some Semitawres, and some, more halfe a Beare, Other halfe swine, deepe wallowing in the miers: All beastly mindes, that could not be reformed, Were to the shapes of their owne shame transformed. There might he see, a Monkey with an Ape, Climing a tree, and cracking of a nut: One sparrow teache an other how to gape, But not a tame one, taught to keepe the cut: And many a jacke daw, in his foolish chat, While parets prated of they knew not what. There might he see Beares baited all with dogges, Till they were forst to fly into their dennes: And wilde Bores, beating of the lesser hogges, While cocks of game, were fighting for their hens: A little ferret, hunting of a Cunny, And how the olde Bees, suckt the yo?g Bees hony. There might he heare the lions in their roaring, While lesser beastes, did tremble at the sounde: There might he see, Buls one an other goaring, And many a harte sore hunted with a hounde, While Philomene, amid the quechy springe, Woulde cease her note, to heare the Cuckoe sing. There might he see a faulcon beaten downe By carrein crowes, that croste her in her flight. A russet Jerkin, face a veluet gowne, While base companions, braude a noble Knight: And crafty foxes creepe into their holes, While little hoppes were climing lofty poles. There might he see the Satyrs in their daunces, Halfe men, halfe beastes, or deuils in their kindes: There might he see the Muses, in their traunces, Lie downe as dead, as if they had no mindes: There might he see, in all, so little good, As, made him wish, he had bene through the wood. Yit in the path, wherein he sweetely past, No euill thing, had power to take a place: No venumde serpent, might his poison caste, No filthy monster, nor illfauourd face: No lyon, Beare, dogge, Moncky, foxe, nor Crow, Could stoppe the waie, where vertue was to goe. When, forwardes, on they had not trauailde farre, But that they met, a monster fowle, and fell: Armde, as it seemde, with all the world to warre, And none but heauen, could of his conquest tell: Seuen were his heads, seuen tailes, ech taile a sting, And but one body: oh most beastly thing. Now, on the left hand of this passage stoode, This ougly horror, hate of al good nature: When on the right hand glauncing through the wood, Through sunny beames came downe a blessed creature: Angell at least, by heauenly Mercy sent, To comfort vertue, where discretion went. White was her weede, and shining was her face, Her fetherde winges, did glister all like golde: And in her eie shee caried such a grace, As was on earth, too glorious to beholde. Which made the pilgrime on his knees adore her, As one vnworthy once to stande before her. But when shee saw humilities affection, Wonne from the world to seeke for heauenly fauour, And that the soule by wisdomes sound direction In sacred flowers, should finde the sweetest fauour: Shee raisde him vp, and badde him there receiue, The true delightes, should not the soule deceiue. When lifted vp, by that faire hande of loue, That brought the hart an vnknowne happines And euery seruant, sweetly did approue, A blessing in their Masters blessednes: With silent thoughtes, they humbly did attende The words, that did their comfort comprehende. Poore wretch quod shee, thy faithfull patient hart The highest powers in pitty doe regarde: Where true repentance pleades for no desart. But bounties grace, where Mercy giues rewarde: The heauens haue harde thy humble happy praier, To helpe thy hope, and keepe thee from despaire: The labour that thy loue hath tane in hande, Thy trauaile, minding neuer to retire: The happy staie, whereon thy hope doth stande, Where humble praier but pitty doth aspire: Haue got thee grace in Mercies glorious eies, To finde the path that leades to paradise. This is the path, that patience onely treades, Where life doth goe on pilgrimage to loue: Whose humble hart, the holy spirite leades, Vnto the height of blessed hopes behoue: Whom graces garde, till perils al be past, And faith resolu'de, doe finde her rest at last. Since thou hast scapte the vaunt of Venus vaine, And not presumde Diana to approch: Since Flora coulde no further fauour gaine, Nor Ceres coulde thy carefull thought encroch: Since fooles, and deuils, all are driuen awaie, Bide but a night, and thou shalt see the daie. Since thou hast scapte the way of wretchednes, Where shameles mindes to shamefull shapes are turned, And founde the waie of fairest blessednes Where hart enflamde, with vertues fire hath burned: Keepe on the pathe, and turne on neither side, Grace to thy hope will be a happy guide, Thinke it not long to cumme to heauen at last, Nor linger time to hinder happy speede: Feare not the sunne, though skies be ouercast, And let a candell stande the night in steede: So marke the light that liues in Vertues eies. And loue shall leade thee straight to paradise. Feare not the foes, nor forces thou shalt meete, For thou shalt meete with monsters, many a one: But faith resolu'de treds fortune vnder feete, Where vertue comes, will vices all be gone. Hell cannot hurt, whom heauenly powers defend, Where grace begins, hope makes a happy end. Lo neere at hand, he that would hurt thee most, An ougly Monster, full of all corruption: By whose illusion many soules haue lost, Their liuely hopes, by lewdenes interruption. A Lier, Theife, and master of all evill, The sier of sinne, the fiende of hell, the deuill. Seauen are his heades, as many are his tailes. Each head a tongue, and euery taile a sting: And woe to them, with whom his tongues prevailes. Within the compase of his tails to bringe. But skorne his wordes, or quite him with disgrace, And thou shalt kill, or make him fly the place. His body is the very sinke of sinne, Into which hole, all hellish filth doth runne: A plague of pride, presumption did beginne, An endles plague, that was in pride begunne: Where every head the body standes in steed, With poisoned soules, the filthy paunch to feede. His swordes, are wordes with which he is to fight, Whose forces can but faithles hartes offende: For, if hee looke but once at vertues light, He faintes for feare, and feeles his forces ende: But heare him speake and neuer feare his spight, When vertue laughes at vanites delight. His greatest head, and that doth gape most wide, Is proude Ambition, swallowing worldly wealth: Which faithles soules infectes with filthy pride, Killing the spirit for the bodies health: Vpon which head, he beares a triple crowne, That, (Vertue sees) is neere his tumbling downe. In which great head, his tongue is all vntruth, Lies, to bewitch the worlde vnto his will: The ease of Age, the high conceit of Youth: Are greatest groundes of his vngratious skil: To gouerne States, is such a stately thinge: What slaue is he that would not be a King? And thus the villaine would the world perswade, To prowde attemptes that may presume to high: But earthly ioies wil make him proue a Iade, When vertue speakes of loues diuinity: Where humble hart, doth to that heauen aspire, Where is no place for any proude desire. The seconde heade, is wicked avarice, Choking itselfe, with trash in steade of treasure: Whose tongue, is treason that can best deuise, To hurte the spirite, with the bodies pleasure: But talke of vertues ioie in misery, And he wil pine to death in penury. The thirde foule head, is filthy Gluttony, Deuouring more then it can well digest: Leading the harte to loathsome villany, And of a man doth make an ougly beaste: But, answere him with fasting, and with praier, The very wordes will kill him with their aier. The fourth bad head, is beastly slothfulness, Sleeping, and snorting, like a filthy swine: Loosing the time in loathsome idlenes, Dreaming of that, which neuer was diuine: But answere him, with vertues carefull watching, He faintes, and falls, to finde his ouermatching. The fifte vile heade, is filthy lechery, Which leades the hart, to hateful wickednes: His tongue, a forge of fancies treachery, To bring the soule, to all vnhappines: But, answere him, with vertues chaste desire, And, he will bite his very taile for ire. The sixte is enuy, full of malice fraught, Feeding on snakes, that faine would vertue stinge: Which, where they finde their forces come to nought, Into his mouth they backe their poison bring: But say how patience, leades to paradise, He frets, and fumes, and in impatience dies. The seventh is murther, most accursèd head Whose tongue is blasphemy, all dide in blood: Which, with the harts of harmeles creatures feade, Lappes in the broath of an infernall foode: But, saie how vertue doth for vengeance crie, And dead he falles, or els awaie doth flie. Now, beare these heauenly lessons all by harte, And take these bookes to benefite thy minde; In each of which is hidde a secret arte, Whose proper vse, maie profite in his kinde: But chiefly doe this holly booke peruse, Where speciall comfortes, maie thy spirit chuse. When, hauing giuen into his humble hande, Seuen sundry bookes, whereon to vse his wit: And last, the staie, whereon the state did stande, Of happy life, where heauenly loue doth sit, The holy booke, of vertues blessèd vaine: Home shee returnes vnto her heauen againe. Which, when the pilgrime humbly did beholde, Carrying in minde, the comforts of his hart: Which, to his faith, her fauour did vnfolde, To keepe the soule from an infernall smart: Against the fury of this fiende of hell Onwardes he goes, God speede his passage well. When, not to stand on circumstance too long, He meetes anon with this same monster thing: Who, by illusion, of the Sirens song, Would seeke a worlde in bondage how to bring. Turning himselfe into a thousand shapes, To feare fond children, and to cosen Apes. And first, he looks like to fiery light, Which would consume, what so did crosse his waie: But soone was donne the force of his despight, Where vertue came he had no power to staie: And then, he would become a speaking birde, But God once namde, he durst not speake a worde. And by and by, he would become a Beare, To feare young children with a foolish noise: But when a man, a beast can neuer feare, He founde it prou'de olde children were no boies: When, by and by, he woulde become an Ape, Oh beastly thing, too neare a humaine shape. But, when that vertue founde the vile effect Of Apish humors, with the Monckish mindes, Shee wholy did the vermins iestes reiect, And forst him seeke for shapes of other kindes: When all his sleightes, could doe him little boote, For, vertue knew, the deuil by his foote. No, though into an Angell faire of light, He coulde transforme him selfe, for to deceiue: Yet coulde he not his foote keepe out of sight, But, vertue coulde his filthy clawe perceiue: So by his foote, shee plainely did descrie him, Bidding auaunte foule fiende, shee did defie him. Whenas the pilgrime lifting vp his eies, To heauenly powers from hell for to defende him: Sweete Christ once namde, awaie the Serpent flies, And, for a while vnable to offende him: Til once againe the heauens had giuen him leaue, To doe his worst, sweete vertue to deceiue. When in the shape whereof before I spake, With his seuen heads, the wicked Serpent standes: With such a sounde, as made the earth to shake, As halfe the worlde were subiect to his handes: When first, his head of pride began to speake, And, to this pilgrime did this poison breake. Thou little wretch, quod he, of lesser worth, In humaine shape I know not what to name: Whom honors spirit, neuer coulde bring forth, To seeke the fortune of imperial fame: How didst thou fal into this forlorne path, Wherein the worlde so little pleasure hath. Where, see the ground of euery secret griefe Which mortifies the body with the minde: Subiect to euery crosse, and for reliefe, Pitty, the whole that thou must hope to finde: Patience a paine set downe, life but a death, Where care, and sorrow draw a sickely breath. Where eies must be embasèd to the ground, Their pleasing humors, barrèd to beholde: And bended knees, to cappe and courtzy bounde, While barèd head, must bide the bitter colde: The minde must stoupe, the hande must loose his strength, The hart must droupe, and life must yeelde at length. Is this the reach of Reasons noble wit? To see a world, and seeke for nothing in it, In such a chaire doth charie humor sit? To know a worke of worth and not beginne it: Who could of power conceiue of kingly pleasure, Would no conceit in such a comfort measure. Humility? a iolly creeping thought, Patience, a prety purgatory: Sorrow, a fit, for the phisitian wrought And death a gentill ende of misery: Fasting and praier, al the spirits pleasure, Notes for a King, to looke vpon at leasure. No, stoupe no thought, seeke only to subdue, Set no conceit in honor with a crowne: In begger minde, true conquest neuer grew, The village is a cotage to the towne: The Monarchy, doth shew the noble minde, He hath no life that cummes of lower kinde. What slaue wil serue, that easely may commaunde? What Sence wil stoupe, that may be set alofte? Who wil desire, that needes not to demaunde? Who loues the boordes may haue his bedde made softe? Or who regardes the rascall beggers teares? That may haue Musicke to contente his eares. What poore conceit, wil begge for cr?mes of bread? May haue his table furnisht all with cates? Or breake his hart with hammers of his head? May passe his humors with his pleasing mates: Faire, wise, rich, learned, valiant, young, and olde, Power is the hande, doth at commandement holde. And so he stopt, but swelling with such pride, As if his braine would haue with poison burst: To whom, the pilgrime presently replied, Avaunt foule fiende, and Monster most accurst: Thou hate of heauen, and greatest hagge of hell, What wicked tale hast thou presumde to tell. Wretched, blasphemous spirit of presumption, Ougly in shape, and horrible in sence, Thou cursèd substance of the souls consumption, The heauens displeasure, and the worlds offence: That knowst no worth, and art not worth the knowing, Rot in thy roote, ere thou haue further growing. Thou wicked witch, fonde fortunes first deuiser, To bring a desperate spirit to defame, And by illusion, first the soules supriser, That heares thy wordes, and wil beleeue the same: How durst thou once presume so neere this path, Where hatefull humor, neuer passage hath. Thou grounde of griefe, heere is the grounde of grace, Thou foule infection, heere is fairest health, Thou crosse of crosses, heere is comfortes place, Thou pitties want, and heere is pitties wealth, Thou dire impatience, dole, and deadly strife, Curst be the death that stoppes the waie of life. Whose blinded eies, are barde all blessed light, Whose crooked knees, are crampt for crafty creeping: Whose triple crowne, in vertues humble sight, Will breake thy necke, and rest in better keeping: Whose hart subdued, by hande of heauenly strength, Must liue in paine of neuer ending length. Canst thou the rage of wil, the rules of wit? Is all the world, ought els but vanitie? Who in the chaire of chaunging choise doth sit, Knowes nothing of diuine humanity, Nor in conceit, can comfort truly measure, That knows not pride the plage of high displeasure. Humility, high Angels happy thought, While patience, is the deuils purgatory: Sorrow a fit, for faithes phisitians wroughte, While high heauens mercy, endes worldes misery: Fasting, and praier, happines procuring, While true repentance is but hope enduring. Then stoupe foule pride, whom heauens did full subdue, Know that thy crowne is cumming tumbling downe: Vertue doth see how by ilusion grew, The worldes disgrace, to grace thee with a crowne: Monarch of mischiefe, such is all thy minde, Nor hath he life that cummes of such a kinde. His seruice, freedome, that made thee a slaue, His seate alofte, that makes thee lie full lowe: His wante a welth, that sees thee nothing haue, His boorde a bed, that makes thee watch for woe: His almes sweete, that saues the beggers teares, While thou hast nought but cries to fill thine eares. A poore conceite, that starues for lacke of crums, And yet will tell the worlde of delicates: Who ofte for hunger feedst vpon thy thumbes, When death and sorrowe, are thy hellish mates: Faire, wise, riche, learned, valiant, olde, and young, Take heede of pride, and of his poisned tongue. And with what worde I knowe not how it fell, But, downe the crowne, came tumbling on the grounde: Whenas the head, with anger seemde to swell, Like an Aposthume, of a poisoned wounde: Which breaking inwarde, of the sodaine shroncke Into the body: oh most beastly troncke. The heade of pride thus suddainely consumde, Or shroncke into this filthy sincke of sinne: The second head, foule Auarice presumde, With wicked wordes, the miser mindes to winne: Ah, begger, worme, and needy wretch quod he, What dost thou thinke that will become of thee. Hath patience bred in thee this poore conceite, That colde and hunger be thy harts content? Doest thou not see, how manie thousandes waite, In honors fielde, vpon the golden tente? Or knowest thou not, power, wisedome, wit and pleasure, All haue their Essence, in the golden treasure. What face so faire, that is not grac't in golde, What wit of worth, but hath in golde his wonder? What learning, but with golden lines doth holde, What state so high, but gold will bring him vnder? What thought so sweete, but gold doth better season, And what rule best, but in the golden reason. Be lorde of landes, and cram thy chest with coine, Feare nought but neede, mony will make a friende: Let conscience learne the cunning to purloine, Wit without welth, hath but a wofull ende: The golden scepter, and the golden crowne, Doth make the subiect on his knees come downe. The grounde is fat, that yeeldes the golden fruite, The study high, that hits the golden state: The labour sweete, that gets the golden suite, The reckning right, that makes the gold? rate: The hap is sure, that golden hap doth holde, And rich is gaine, that serues the god of golde. And with that worde the wicked thing did cease, When presently the pilgrime thus replied: Oh cursed cancker, crosse of conscience peace Whose hatefull harte, doth all ill humors hide: Thou kindling cole of an infernall fire, Die in the ashes of thy dead desire. Impatient spirite liuing all by spoile, Drunke like the dropsy, and yet euer drye: Consumde with care, and tirèd out with toyle, Seeminge to liue, and yet dost ever die: How durst thou so the name of god blaspheme, To giue to drosse so great a Diademe. Thou stone-colde hart, with hungring after coine, My care in heauen, doth seeke my hartes content: Thou scrapst for pelfe, I seeke not to purloine, In Vertues field, I seeke but mercies tent When wisedome findes, in power of highest pleasure, The world al trash, compared to heauenly treasure. Fowle is the faire that hath in gold her grace, Worthles the wit that hath in wealth his wonder: Vnlearnèd lines, put gold in honors place, Wicked the state, that will to coine cume vnder: Base the conceite, that seasonde is with golde, And begger rules, that such a reason holde. Thou plodst for landes, I seeke a liuing place, Thou fearste but neede, I, mony make no frinde: Thy conscience, cunning, and my care is grace, Thy wits welth, wo, my harts wish heauen at ende: Thy golde is drosse, and vertue is my crowne, Where hartes submission, puls ambition downe. Earth giues thee golde, heauens giue me higher grace, Men study wealth, but Angels wisedomes state: Laboure seekes pence, loue hath a higher place, Death makes thy reckening, life is all my rate: Thy happe is hell, my hope of heauen doth holde, God giue me grace: die deuill with thy golde. And with that worde, the heade beganne to shrincke, The face dead pale, and hollow grew the eies: And so, at laste, did all, and wholy sincke Into that hell, that heade of Auarice: When vp did start the heade of Gluttonie, Vomiting out theese wordes of villany. Poore braun falne begger, whereon dost thou feede? Well fare the mouth, that feedes the belly full: What staruing humor standes thy wit in steede, The want of victuaile, makes the body dull: I finde it true no triumph to a feast, The belly full the bones will be at rest. Some feede their eies with staring on the starres, And starue the body to content the minde: Some with their wittes will be so long at warres, They grate on crusts, when other men haue dinde: But let the franticke so their humor please, Giue me the life, of meate, and drinke, and ease. When that the earth doth giue vs pleasing foode, What reason is it nature shoulde refuse it? If reason finde, what wil doe nature good, What bootes to haue it, if we doe not vse it? Then let me feede, while I haue power to eat, The mouth was made to giue the body meat. Oh when the tongue is pleasèd with a tast, The stomacke feeds vntil the heart do laugh, And then a cuppe with a carowsing cast, And then a health out of a frindely quaffe: Then workes the braine in such a blessed wise, As if the body were in paradise. When thinking more to speake, his mouth ranne ouer, With beastly humors, loathsome to beholde, And in such sort, as he coulde not recouer, Till that he did, his filthy sence vnfolde: When stopping so, the pilgrime gan replie, Die ougly venum in thy villany. Thou filthy, fat, and ouerfoggy flesh, Foule bagpipe-cheekes, eies starting from the head: Whom heauenly humors neuer can refresh, That all in hel, hast made thy hateful bedde: Heauens let me fast, from such a loathsome feast, Where to much feeding makes a man a beast. Earth fill thine eies, heauens feede my humble hart. Drosse fil thy belly, Grace content my minde: Of worldly Iunckets take thy pleasing part, Grace, giue my soule, one crum, and I haue dinde: So with thy frensies, doe thy fansie please, Heauens be my rest, whom earth can neuer ease. Earth feedes of earth, heauens giue the spirit foode, Nature corrupted lost the key of reason: The body knowes not of the spirits good, Vse is abuse, where truth is saust with treason: Then role, and tumble in thy beastly riot, The dish of mercy, be my spirits diet. O when the tongue is toucht with cruel fire, The stomacke feedes, of an infernal flame: A cuppe of coles to quench a foule desire, A cureles hart, consuming in the same: Then workes the spirit with such woful cries, As proues in hel, was neuer paradise. When this same filthy hedde of Glotony, Beastly bedight with his abhorrèd diet: Chokèd with venum of such villany, As breedes the ground of natures most desquiet: Soncke backe into the belly of the beast, Which of such spirites made his speciall feast. When started vp the head of slouthfulnes, With ougly clawes picking his gummy eies: Who with the noddes of natures heuines, Did in few wordes, this filthy speech deuise: What humor wretch, doth thee so waking keepe, That thou canst fèede vpon so little sleepe. Sleepe is the pride of ease, the height of pleasure, The Nurse of nature, and the rule of rest: The thoughtes attonement, and the sences treasure, The bedde of loue, that likes the body best: Against vnrest the only remedy And onely medicine to ech mallady. And therewithall vnwilling more to speake, Such heauy qualmes his hart had ouercome: With stretching yawnes, as if his Iawes would breake, He stopt his speech, as wholy stroken dumme: When nodding of his head from side to side, To his deafe eares, the pilgrime thus replied. Thou cursèd serpent, grounde of al disgrace, By Idlenes begetting Ignorance: Which dost the sprigges of fairest rootes deface, With loathsome course of lifes discountenaunce: And makst a pleasure of the spirits paine, Die in thy dreame, and neuer wake againe. Sleepe is the soules disease, the mindes dispight, The Curse of Nature, and the crosse of rest: The thoughtes disquiet, and the darkesome night, Wherein the spirit likes the body lest: A losse of time and reasons malladie, Where death is found but sorrowes remedy. The watching virgins kindely were receiued, When such as slept did loose their happy houre: In dreames, the sences often are deceiued, When waking wits finde shadowes haue no power. Then sleepe thy last, where life hath neuer place, God graunt my soule, to watch, and praie for grace. When thus the head of hateful slouthfulnes, Was soncke into the filthy sincke of Sinne: The harmeful head of al vnhappines, Did lechery, this loathsome tale beginne: Alas poor pilgrime, childe of chast desire, Hast thou bin burnt thou canst not bide the fier? A gentle iest, a man to be a maide, What minsing humor doth the sences measure? That Nature can of beauty be afraide, And loose her prime before she know her pleasure: Fleshe hath no fauour in diuinity, Nor Nature, pleasure in virginity. The childe that knowes not how to make his choice, Must be a babe, so babishe let him bee: But he that knowes, how better to reioice, Will seeke a worlde, where sweeter thoughtes agree: No, thinke of loue to be that pleasing thought, That, for his will sets all the worlde at nought. What figure findes not loue out of a face? What humors notes he not, in euery heare? In beauties eies, what stars doth he not place, What roses in her cheekes, doth he not beare? What hony in her lippes, and sweeter worth? In her faire ground but he can gather forth. It whets the wit, and doth embolden will, And maketh Arte to worke beyond her selfe: It maketh nature, study reasons skill, And in her humors, play the pretty elfe: It bringeth fancy to a deinty feast, And makes a man, that woulde be els a beast. What deinty glaunces passe from eies to eies? When sweete conceites, are secretly conceiued? What comfortes can the kissing hearts deuise? Where kinde effectes of fauour are receiued: Age can reporte, and youth doth daily prooue, Their is no comforte to the course of loue. And with that worde, did ende his wicked charme: Vnto which sounde, the pilgrime gan reply, Thou hatefull head, and grounde of euery harme, Venum, compounded all of villany: A foule infection of the fairest creature, Die in the filth of thy corrupted nature. Thou sleepy slouth, that figurste out the swine, With groueling humors, tumbling on the grounde: Thou canst not thinke, vpon a thought diuine, But liu'st in dreames, where all deceits are founde; How durst thou speake in that foule thoughts defence, Which breedeth nothing but the soules offence. Vertue and vice, were neuer friendes in deede, Diana knowes that Venus is no maide, But faith, that doth on heauenly blessing feede, Of foolish beauty maie be well afraide: When Natures pleasure in virginity Shewes flesh hath fauoure in diuinity. And, where the spirit doth the sences measure, There is no place to let thy poison in: When Natures pride, is but in vertues pleasure, Life only endes, that did in loue beginne: Where temper?ce rules in reasons chast desire, Will keepe the harte, from thy infernall fire. Thou wretched childe, of natures wicked choice. Accursèd bable, and so euer bee: That makste the flesh in filth for to reioice, Wherein the spirite doth but sorrowe see: Calst thou it loue, that is but lewde conceite? Die in thy lust, that art the soules deceite. Ciphers the figures, found in beauties face, Humors of heares, illusions of the minde: The heauenly stars in earth haue neuer place, Where painted roses, haue no perfect kinde: Her hony, gall, and what shee can bring forth, The best, and all, is worse then nothing worth. It blunts the wit, with to much boldning will, And forceth Arte, for to forget her selfe: It draweth Nature, quite from vertues skill, When wilfull reasone plaies the wicked elfe: Where, better fast, then fall to such a feast As makes a man in deede become a beast. What deuilish glaunces passe twixt graceles eies, When base contents, most beastly are conceiued: What crosses more, can kissing hartes deuise, Then when the spirits ruine is receiued, Age may repent, and youth with sorrow proue. Who followes lust, can neuer come to loue. Oh, what a fire is filthy lechery, Whose substance is but all of gluttony, Whose sparcles are, but only ribaudry, Whose filthy smoke, is foulest infamy, Whose ashes, are but all vncleanelines, Whose hatefull ende is hellish beastlines. Which true description, did so discontent The harmefull head of hatefull lechery, As when she saw of the ende of her intent Crost, in the course of all her trechery, Shee bit her taile, with such vnholsome breath, As with her biting, stung her selfe to death. When spake the head of enuy all infected, With ougly Snakes, whereon shee seemd to feede: Thou foole quod shee, what hath thy hart affected, Wilt thou endure, thine ABC, to reede? Canst thou abide to see an other goe, Towardes the wealth, that thou dost wish for so? Equality is but a childish humor, He is alone, that keepes the lofty seate: What voice is hard? where al are in a rumor, Or who is seru'd, where euery one is great? Why, patience is the paterne of a villaine, That neuer came neare to a Kings pauilion. And with that word she fed vpon her Snakes, As if her heart, did like none other foode: Whereto the pilgrime soone this answere makes, Vgratious grifte, and voide of heauenly good: Feede on thy Snakes, vntill the poison fill thee, And thine owne cancker with corruption kill thee. Equality is childrens blessednes, Where many brethren are but one in loue: The voice hard sweete, whose sounde is holinesse, And God wel seru'd, where graces glory proue: And he that patience paternes for a villaine, Shal neuer know the King of heauens pauilion. Thou neuer readst the booke of Christ his Crosse, Nor canst endure so sweete an ABC: But thou art bounde to liue with labours losse, Where al the woes of al the world maie be: God giue my spirit, grace to seeke no more, Then goe the waie his Sainctes haue gone before. When, (as it seemde) the venum wrought so sore, Within the hart, as poisnèd so the heade, As shrinking downe, it sight, and spake no more, But with the rest the filthy body fedde: When started vp the head of murthring wrath, As newly cumme from out summe bloody bath. Who gratting of his teeth with knitting brow, Shaking his fist, as if he mente to fight: Thou patch quod he, where art thou plodding now? Hath patience thinkst thou, such a princely might: That shee can thee against my force defende, And bring thee safely to thy Iourneies ende? My life is most to lay me downe in blood, I can endure no daunting of mine eie: I onely loue to feede on bloody foode, Whom I once cease on, they are sure to die: How durst thou then approch so neere my sight, Whose fury standes withal the worlde to fight. Poore patient hartes are tost from post to post, When bloody swordes doe walke the worlde with wonder: Poor patience many a patrimony lost, While will resolu'de, put wit and reason vnder: Patience is oft from princely seate puld downe, While bloody mindes, do brauely beare the crowne. Pitty is knowen sometime to marre a citty, And Anger, oftentimes is cause of quiet: Sometime as good be wilful as be witty, When bloody dishes make a dainty diet: What armes of honor to a bloody field? Where Angers hande, make patient harts to yeelde. When (as it seemde) halfe stuffèd vp with blood, Stopping his tale the pilgrime thus replied: Choke vp thy throat, with that foule butchers food, That neuer couldst the sounde of mercy bide: But dost consume the hart of many a creature, Die in the fury of thy filthy nature. Fret, fume, and chafe, I feare not of thy force, I plod with patience where thou canst not cumme: My patience hath such power in her remorse, As furies sences quickely wil benumme: And by her prowesse, stoutly so defende me, That thou, nor thine, nor ought els can offende me. Then lie, and bath, and tumble in thy bloode, And stare, and stampe, til thou hast donne thy worst. Thy foule adherents, I haue all withstoode, And thou, art but a spirit all accurst: Who though thou makst a number know thy might, Where patience cums, thou hast no power to fight. Poore patient harts, are tost from paine to peace, When bloody swords, do breede but hellish woes: And patience patrimony is no leace, But in a grounde, where grace and wisedome growes: And patience sits with an immortal crowne, Where tiraunt heads to hel are beaten downe. Pitty must be the princesse of a citty, And Anger breedeth nothing but disquiet: Wilful is good, so that the wil be witty, Where bloode is bard the dish of mercies diet; What Armes of honor, to that heauenly fielde, Where patience force, makes angers fury yeelde. At which last worde, the fretting furious head, Fel with the rest, into that sincke of sinne. And with the body fel downe stroke as dead, When patience did this pilgrimes ioy beginne: With praysing heauens, and vsing humble praier, To comforte hope, and keepe of al dispaire. When leauing so the ougly Monster slaine, Onwardes she leades him on his happy way. Where ioiful pleasure after feare of paine, Had set his sences at so sweete a staie: That now, he thought no Monster could offende him, He had such proofe, that patience woulde defende him. But when the heauens that pitty haue of nature. And know that sences, woulde be gladde of rest: Although the spirite, waking keepe the creature, Vnto such worke, as like the wisedome best: Into their garde, did will the Angels take him, Vntill they wilde the spirite shoulde awake him. Bvt when the spirite little time coulde spare Vnto the harte, to giue the senses rest: And reason founde that vertues happy fare, Was in the hande, wherewith the soule is blest: He wilde the sences from their sleepe arise, And follow patience to their paradise. When hauing past the path along the wood, They came vnto a shore, neare to a sea: Where lofty waues did threaten little good, When rocks with patience make a drowning plea: Where stormes, and tempests, flawes, and rocks, and sands, The perils shew, wherein the seaman standes. With patience heere the pilgrime must imbarke, Within a shippe the Buonauenture named: When in a Mappe he found out many a marke, Whereby conceite his course most happly framed: And to be shorte, with a resoluèd minde, They hoist vp sailes, God sende a merry winde. When as they founde the tide would tary none, And little wit it was to loose the winde, What grounde was best to cast their ancker on, And how they might their surest passage finde: To scape the rockes, and to auoide the sandes, And keepe their carriage out of pirots handes. And so, along the surging seas they slide, Till passing by capa di buon speranza, Not farre from thence, they did intende to ride Till some sweete winde that vertue ben auanza: Would bid them hoice their sailes and to be gone, Towardes the heauen they were to hope vpon. Where, after sounding, casting ancker out, And striking saile, and winding vp the cable, Setting in order all thinges rounde aboute, As well as such young Mariners were able: With such good thoughtes as might the time beguile, They fell to walke vpon the boordes awhile. And riding but a while, an one they spied, A fisher man, all in his boate alone, With euery billow tost from side to side, As made them feare his last farewell anone: When moued with the pitty of good nature They calde aboorde this silly wretched creature. With much adoe, the creature came aboorde, And tooke the pilgrime humbly by the hande: And onely sight, but did not saie a word, But, as a man that halfe amasde did stande: Till by entreaty of sweete patience, Hee was content to haue some conference. Alas quod hee good Masters, heere yee see A selly creature in a sory case: A wofull story to be tolde of mee, Borne to the death of sorrow and disgrace: Curst from my cradell, with a thousand crosses, Where fortune turnes my labours all to losses. I have not alwaies liu'de a fisher man, Through other courses, I my course haue runne: It is but late, that I this life beganne, Where little good, hath yet my laboure donne: But yet I like the kinde of life so well, I woulde not chaunge it with a king to dwell. For first I was a gallant in my youth, And then I courted youthfull kinde of people: But when my tale was tolde, to tell a truth, I founde although the sexton kept the steeple, The bels sometimes against his will were rong, When talking clappers could not holde their tongue. I founde that cost was often kindely taken, And costly kindnes was a common thing: I found the needy friend was soone forsaken, And he that had the crownes was halfe a king: I founde that flattry was a fine conceite, And gold was seru'd, where better gifts did waite. I found faire beauty like a blasing starre, But oftentimes, the moone was in a mist, And many a one, was with his wits at warre, While reason reade the rules of had I wiste: I founde sweet musicke sounde in many a place While empty purses were in weeping case. I founde a thousande prety foolishe toies, That were too tedious now for to recite, I founde againe that there were further ioies, Then I coulde see but by the sunny light: Which for mine eies could neuer come to see, Ha done quod I, this is no life for me. Then to the warres forsooth a little while, To followe drummes, and trumpets to the fielde: But oh how will doth wofull wit beguile, When want of comfort makes the conscience yeeld: And yet, when peace doth make an ende of strife, Surely the souldiers is the princely life. But, for I did but little time bestow, Amidde the fielde to seeke for honors fame: And fortune sought my comfortes ouerthrow, Before my hart had entrance to the same: I lefte that life, and to the seas I gat, Where, how I liu'd I neede not tell you that. I thinke your selues can tel as wel as I, If not, alas, it is no ease to learne: So many labours in the life doe lie, As are not in a daie for to discerne: A daie, a month, nor many a yeare, God wot, As I could tel, if I haue not forgotte. First I did learne to set my compasse right, And by my compasse, how my course to run To marke each point, as wel by day as night, By night, to marke the stars, by day the sunne: Then take the Mappe, to look for rockes and sandes, Of which ful ofte, the shippe in daunger standes. Then narrowly to looke to euery leake, And when the winde did serue to hoise my sailes: To sounde the depth, where seas beginne to breake, And strike my saile, when once my searoome failes: To arme my fightes, and plant nine ordnaunce so, I might not stande, in feare to meete my foe. Then did I learne to stande and guide the sterne, And now and then to helpe to hoise vp ancker: And otherwhiles the cunning to discerne, To dresse hir sides to keepe hir from the cancker: My termes of arte, and patient to be painefull, And how to hope to make my voiage gainful. To lie ful colde, and harde, and fare full thinne, To frame my carkas to vnkindest natures, To beare of stormes, and in a calme beginne To learne to kill the little creeping creatures: To eate a fusty cake, and teinted fish, And one fresh morsell, make a deinty dish. To make no conscience, so there came in gaine, When siluer crosses, keepe of many a curse: A pitteous case to see the Merchant slaine, For his owne goods to fil the pirots purse: To sweare, and stare, vntil we come to shore, Then rifty tufty, each one to his skore. The Master, he sometime would fall asleepe, The Masters mate to much vpon the can: The boson, he his cabin tooke to keepe, And in the cookerome, there the rie begane: When all and some, in halfe a droncken swowne, Would leaue the shippe, to sincke, themselues to drowne. But, when I saw the kinde of life was such, The griefe to great for any true good minds: The labour sore, the sorrow was too much, To seeke for that which but repentance finds: I left the shippe, with manie a sorrie note, And tooke me sweetely to my little boate. And heere, my trade is poore, yet ful of peace, And peace is riches, though my trade be poore: The sea is large, whose landlorde makes no lease, I toile for fishes, and I seeke no more: When stormes arise, vnto the heauen I high me And in the sunne-shine, set me downe and drie me. But, for I see the barke, wherein you ride, Of Buonaventure hath the blessed name, And patience is a pure a perfect guide Vnto the fauour of eternal fame: I hope the course is good that you intende, Heauens bring you happly to your Iournies end. This poore mans tale when thus the pilgrime harde, He did along his company entreate, Promising him, a pilgrime poore rewarde, Besides his hope, his comfort woulde be great, If heauens did fauoure vertues enterprise, Humbly to passe the path to paradise. But, when the fisher harde that fairest worde, Of paradise, once sounding in his eare; He gaue consent and hoist his boat aboarde, And casting of al sorrow, care, and feare: They hoist vp sailes, windes seru'de, what would you more, Onwardes they goe, God sende them well a shore. When leauing Scilla to those silly guides, That careles are to keepe their course aright: By curst Charibdis, on he smoothly slides, Till by good happe they had a land in sight: To which they made with might and maine as fast As windes woulde serue, and got to shore at last. Yet, let me tel you, ere they came a shore, As through the Oce? they did make their way: Tempests arose, and many a winde blew sore, That threatened ofte the course of their decay: Besides the pirots that they put to flight, Which chrost their course with many a cruell fight. One where they saw wrakes lie without reliefe, An otherwhere, whales tumbling in the waues: An other while, vnto their deadly griefe, Stormes threaten sore, the fishes maws their graues: Yet when the worst of all these ills were past, Safely arriu'de they came to shore at last. Where, wethring of themselues against the sunne, First praising God, by his almighty power, That guided them since first their course begunne, And brought them safely to that happy howre: The hart laide downe, the sences all to rest, While angels watch the waking spirit blest. Bvt, when the spirit had but little time, To giue the sences leaue to take their rest, Nor was the laboure little for to clime, The fiery ashes, of a Phoenix nest: Hee bad them sweetely from their sleepe arise And set them in their path to paradise. Where walking on, they met on their right hande, A worlde of people, making pitteous mone: Some lost their goods, some other lost their lande, Their parents some, and some, their friends were gone: Not one of all, but some way were oppressed, When all, and some, in some, where al distressed. The Courtier, hee complainde, of loues disgrace, The souldier, he cried out, of lacke of paie: The lawier, lacke of hearing of his case, The client, how his coine went to decaie: The merchaunt, of the losse of his aduenture, The prentice of the bandes of his Indenture. The landlorde, of his tenaunts beggery, The passinger of lacke of amity: The tenaunt, of the landlordes misery, The begger, all, of lacke of charity: The churchmen, of their small possessions, The laiemen, of the church transgressions. Now, on the left hande, went another crue, A hatefull sort, of hellish company: Which, to their welth, and wortheles honor grue, By wicked workes, of wofull villany: Which, by the trades of Machauile instructed, Were by the deuill, to his hel conducted. One, he blasphemde, and murthred many an othe, Another, made of honesty, a iest: An other made a tush, at faith, and troth, An other boasted of a bloudy feast: And some, in power, how will did gouerne reason, And other, of their pollicy in treason. The Courtier, boasted of his braue attire, What lordshippes, he had laid vpon his backe: The souldier bragde what townes he set on fire, How many citties he had helpt to sacke: The lawier, of his quidities, and quirkes, The client, of the knowledge of his ierkes. The landlorde, of his tenants slauery And, how hee kept the pesauntes all in awe: The tenant of his cunning knauery, When with his landlorde he could go to law: The Merchant, how his gaines were brought about, The prentice, how he got his freedome out. The churchmen, they wente boasting on their tenthes, And twenties too, and yet they would haue more: The Laiemen, of their laying lines at lengthes, And how a chalke did make a pretty skore: The passinger, of fainèd amity, The begger, of the bagge of charity. After all these, vpon the right hand went, A selly foole, for so I tearme him right: With wringing hands, that seemèd to lament Some crossing humor to a vaine delight: For, loue forsooth, and nought but loue it was, That made a woman make a man an Asse. Of Venus frailty and of Cupids blindenes He cried out, oh, that euer they were borne: And of his mistris more then most vnkindnes, That did so much his truest seruice skorne: Yet, still he lou'de her, and he did so loue her, It was his death, he neuer coulde recouer. And then he sight, and sobde, and hong the head, And wept, and wailde, and cast vp both the eies, And in a trance, as if a man were dead, Or did some dying kinde of fit deuise: Vntill he walkte, and then he cried oh loue, That euer louer shoulde such sorrowe proue. And then he redde his verses and his rimes, Wherein he praisde her to to, out of reason, And then he sight to thinke how many times, He watcht, the day, the night, the hower, the season To finde some fruite of her deseruèd fauoure, But al his flowers, were weedes that had no sauour. And then farewell, and then againe farewell, And farewell loue, and farewell louely sweete, And farewel sweete, where loue doth sweetly dwel. And farewell dwelling, for loue sweetenes meete: And farewell meeting, with loues stately store, And farewell loue, for hee coulde liue no more. And thus the pilgrime let the poore man goe, To loose his will, and seeke his better wits: Which he had lost with following fancy so, Vnto the fury of these franticke fits: That in his hart, had wrought that mallady, That he must die, there was no remedy. Now on the left hande went another creature, Or rather spirit in an ougly shape: Hollow dead eies, and most ilfauourde feature, Mopping and mowing, like an olde she-Ape: Which in the fury of youthes frenzy, To crosse loues ioie, is callèd Ielousy. Cursing that euer Venus was so faire, Or Cupid had the power to bende his bow: Or euer worde had passage through the aier. From fansies tongue, to beauties eares to go: When trickling humors, in affections brest, By feare of ioies is Ielousies vnrest. Then winckt, and pinckt, and leerde and honge the lippe, And seemde to start, at euerie sodaine breath: And grounde her teeth, as though some priuy nip, Within her head, did fret her hart to death: When out she mumbled, most vnhappy loue, That makst the minde, these passions to approue. But when the pilgrime saw her agony, And, in what taking, wretched thing, she was: Little contented, with such company, He giues her leaue vpon her way to passe: And keepes his course, vntil anone he came, Vnto a citty,—needles is the name. Where entring in, on each side of the gate, He found it poorely al with beggars garded: And by the forefront of that feeble state, He thought smal wealth where poore were so rewarded: Til entered further in the streetes he founde, A worlde of wealth in euery streete abounde. I meane such welth, as worldly people chuse, To make the comfort of their chiefest kinde: And such a bait as wicked spirites vse, To blinde the sight of a bewitchèd minde: In euery shoppe, or siluer golde or wares, To starue the poore, and fill the rich with cares. When noting wel, by euery doore he went, He saw each house was with a plage infected: Where, though they liu'de content with discontente, Were in the rules of better cares reiected: For, though the poison did not kill at first Yet did they swel, vntil at last they burst: One house was plagèd with a wicked master, An other, with a most accursèd dame: An other with a childe that was a waster, An other, with a seruant out of frame: The rich men, most were plagèd with disease, The poore men, with smal vermin, and with fleas. One house was plagde with cursing and with banning, An other house with swearing, and blaspheming: An other, where fonde minions fell to manning, An other frighted, after foolish dreaming: Some plagde with sorrow, for their losse of treasure, And some with torment after to much pleasure. A number plagues to tedious to recite In euerie corner, compast all the citty: Where power did wrong, and poore men had no right, And golden purses had to little pitty: When many a creature in ful pitteous case, Did proue the citty an vnhappy place. But, when the pilgrime saw on euery side Their outwarde wealth so ful of inwarde wo: And in that state, there was no blisse to bide, Where euery house, alas was plagèd so: Knowing withal, his trauaile wisht no staie, Thorough the streets he hastely made his way. Vntil at last he came vnto a lane, That ledde him to an vniuersity: Where, by the notes that he had quickely tane, He founde a wonderful diuersity: In young opinions, touching points of arte, And how one scholer, tooke on others part. Now, heare the plague, he found but in conceit, Where some were right and other some were wrong: Some followde wil, and wrought vpon deceit, Some louèd truth, and songe none other song. When leauing scolers to their learnèd case, Ruing the plague, with reuerence lefte the place. When passing on, ledde all by patience hande, The happy guide vnto his hopèd grace: While reasons state, did all resoluèd stande, In paradise to seeke his resting place: While heauenly powers, the hart did waking keepe, In vertues armes, the sences fel a sleepe. Bvt stil, the spirit, that had care to keepe The hart awake vnto his happy way, Had little time, to let the sences sleepe, Lest smallest stoppes, might cause to long a staie: And therefore wakt them from their sleepy vaine, And sweetely set them in their path againe. Where, walking on, vnto a court they came, Where they behelde a worlde of beauties welth: A stately prince, and many a princely dame, Discoursing, more of pleasure then of health: Where honors presence was so highly garded, As each conceit of base desire discarded. The Counsaile, graue, as best beseemde their place, The Courtiers, gallant, full of fine conceite: The Ladies, faire, and full of honours grace, The Seruantes, wise, that humbly did awaite: Nothing amisse, that Nature coulde deuise, To please the humor of Affections eies. And, let me not, to slightly ouerpasse, The pleasing ground of euery priuate grace: Where euery sence, so sweetely pleasèd was, As brought the wits into a wondrous case: And such a case, as had not vertue ben, To garde their sence they had ben ouerseene. To see the presence of a princely Queene, To marke the course of graue discretion care: To note the sightes that are but seldome seene, Where youthes desartes in beauties fauoure are: To heare the musicke of most siluer voices, And finde the restes wherein the song reioices. To see what pleasure, power hath in her hande, To heare how youth, can courte his kinde desire, To see, how wisedome doth in power commaunde, And finde how beauty sets the hart on fier, While humble seruauntes, shewe their diligence: Are not these notes for sweete experience? To see how vertues are in honor placed, To see the agèd all with reuerence serued, To see the humble by their seruice graced, And beauties fame by faithfull loue preserued, To see peace, plenty wisedome, honour, loue: Are these not pleasures, for the hart to proue? Now heere the pilgrime did beginne to feare, Some of his seruants woulde be stolne awaie, Either the Sente, the Tast, the Eie, the Eare, Or els the Feeling woulde be forst to staie: Yet, for they sware their seruice to his will, He fearde the lesse, to leade them from their ill. And when he sawe, what perill was in greatnes, What idle thoughtes, in youthfull humors sit, And what a folly, was in to much featenes, Where beauties wonders did but blinde the wit: And what long suites, did gaine but little grace, And last what daungers doe possesse the place. With humble praier vnto the powers on high, To blesse that prince and all those princely peeres, Which in the honour of discretions eie, Were calde the wonders of these latter yeeres: From care, and cost, fancy, and wisedomes folly, He tooke his walke vnto a waie more holly. Where ere they came, they came yet by the way, Vnto a Campe, or rather, kingly fielde: Where, many a stop, did feare too long a stay, Such choice of honors, did such humours yeelde: Where horse and foote, were so in order planted, As, no direction, in discretion wanted. The chiefe commaunder in his stately tente, With noble mindes of Martiall men attended: For euery doubt of euery ill intent, With strongest gardes of watche and warde defended: Whose graue discretion rulde by sounde aduise, Performde the plot of many a rare deuise. To see the carefull Collonels directed, Ech to his quarter, and his regiment: And how ech Captaine, valiauntly effected, The wonder grace of warlike gouernement: To see the true discharge of euery office, And then the honor of aduentures seruice. To note the greate prouision euery waie For victuaile first, munition, armor, shot; For forrege for their horse, for grasse and hay, And such prouaunte, as cheapest may be got: For euery grounde, for euery quarter fit, Are not the workes for euery simple wit. To heere the drummes and fife the larum strike, The horses neie, and then the trumpets sounde, To see the horsemen charge vpon the pike, And then the pikemen laie the horse on grounde, To heare the Canons roar, the small shot rattle, And see their triumph, that doe winne the battaile. To marke the ordering of a court de garde, To note the rules in walking of the rounde, The Scintenils, and euery watch, and warde, And of the mines, and working vnder grounde: To marke the planting of their Ambuscados, And in the night, their sodaine canuassados. To see a Citty sende her bullets out, Against the force of all her cruell foes, To see her wals, all fortified about, To beare the force of all their cruell blowes: To make her foes, perforce their siege to raise, And through the world to winne a wonder praise. Are heere not sights of force to staie the eie? Or soundes, of power for to inchaunt the eare, Nay, maie not wel the hart be drawn awry, From all conceites, to keepe his compasse there: Sure, so it had, had not the spirit still, Preseru'de the sences from a secret ill. For, then againe, to see a citty sackte, Her buildings ruinde, and her people slaine: Her wals, al razèd, and her castles crackt, And al her welth, but in a woful vaine: Her olde men mourning, and her young men dying. The mothers weeping, and their children crying To see her streetes, al runne with streames of blood. Her houses burning, al in flames of fier: To see her state, that al in honor stoode, Yeelde to the forces of their foes desire: Her roial strength, become a ruful storie, And death, and sorrow, ende of al her glorie. To see the fielde, with dead men ouerspread, To see the aire infected al with smoake: To see, the valiaunt Caualieros dead, And many a soldiour hurt with many a stroake: To see the steedes, lie tumbling on the earth. And through the campe a Sickenes or a dearth. To see the soldiour starue, with lake of foode, And, in his march, to die with lacke of drincke: To see the rich men liue on poore mens bloode, And one close humor, at another wincke: To see each Captaine, euerie waie anoied, And, by disorder, all the campe destroied Did make the pilgrime willing to depart The place so ful of daunger and distresse: Where wits might worke but woful was the arte, Where one mans health, bred many heauines: And therefore making there but little staie He followes patience on another way. And on they walke, vntil anone they came, Vnto a Church, not built of lime or stone But that true Church, of that Immortal fame That is worldes wonder, and heauens loue alone: Whose head is Christ, whose Martirs are his pillers And al whose members, are his wordes wel-willers. The gate, is Grace, Contrition, is the key, The locke, is loue, the porter, Penitence: Where humble faith, must heauenly fauour stay, Till pity talke with vertues patience: While angels sighes, the sinners waie deuise, To haue his entraunce into paradise. Which is in deede the plot of al perfection, Drawne by the compasse of diuine conceite, Whose line, is life laide by his loues direction Who makes al flesh vpon the spirite waite: Whose flowers are fruites of faithes eternal fauour, Sweete to the soule, in euerliuing sauour. Now in this grounde, doth liue this glorious King, Of mercies life, amidde the fire of loue, Who, as the sunne, doth cause the flowers to spring, So, by his fire, makes faith her comfort proue: When heauenly ruth doth vertues roote so nourish, That, her faire flowers shall grow and euer floorish. Now heere the herbes were wholsome sentences, Which purge the hart, of euery idle thought: And for each grasse, a grace of wit and sences, By heauenly blessing from the spirit brought: In midst whereof the well of life doth spring, About the which the Angels sit and singe. Heere is the light that makes the sunne to shine, Heere is the brightnes of the morning light, Heere is the sunne, that neuer doth decline, Heere is the daie, that neuer hath a night, Heere is the hope of euerliuing blisse, And comforte, that beyonde all knowledge is. Heere neuer weede, had euer power to growe, Nor euer worme coulde make an herbe to wither, But in the path, where all perfections goe, Vertue and Nature, kindely went togither, And heauenly dewes, did al the fruites so cherish, That, neither fruit, nor herbe, nor flower could perish. Heere neuer sorrow for the thought of losses, Heere euer labour and yet neuer weary; Heere neuer feare, of any fatal crosses, Heere neuer mourning, and heere euer merry: Heere neuer hunger, thurst, nor heat, nor cold, But take enough, and stil the store doth holde. Heere is the sky, the sun, the moone, and stars, Set for a dial, by the heauens direction: Heere neuer cloude their brightest shining barres, But show their brightnes in their best perfection: Heere, is in some the sweetest light of al, From which al lightes haue their original. Heere neuer foote of wicked pride presumed, But is excluded heauenlie paradise: Heere is the aier with sweetest sweetes prefumed, While sinners sighes is blessed sacrifice: When faithful soules in Angels armes embraced, Are in the eie of glorious fauour graced. Heere are the virgins playing, Angels singing The Saintes reioicing, and the Martirs ioying. Heere sacred comfortes to the conscience springing, And no one thought of discontent anoying: Heere hurt was none, and feare of death is neuer, But heere is loue, and heere is life for euer. Heere sorrowes teares, doe quenche the heate of Sinne. And fire of loue, doth kindle life againe: Heere doth the grounde of glory first beginne, And heere is Vertue, in her highest vaine: Heere, is in some the state of honours story, And of all goodnes, the eternall glory. And heere is, lo that heauenly paradise, Whereto the pilgrime, made his pilgrimage: Where sacred mercy first did solempnize, The spirite to the fleshe in mariage: And here the hart did finde his spirit blest, To bring the sences to eternall rest. Gloria in excelsis Deo. In this true plot of reasons highest pleasure, The heaunly court, of the high King of Kings: Where sacred spirits, haue their speciall treasure And sweetest comfort, of contentments springs: God bring your sences, by your harts desire, To feel the comfort of his kingly fier. THE COVNTESSE OF PENBROOKES loue. Faire in a plot of earthly paradise, Vpon a hill, the Muses made a Maze: In midst whereof within a Phœnix eies, There sits a grace, that hath the world at gase: Which Phœnix is but name vnto a nature That shews the world hath scarcely such a creature: This true loues saint, by worthy beauty crowned, Did seeme to wish but not expresse her will: When straunge desires were in deuises drowned, To finde out wonders farthest from her wil: The worlde came in, with presents many a one, But, yet alas, her loue could like of none. Cleare was the day when Phœbus shonne ful bright, But her hartes eie did higher light aspire: Aprill, brought in both earth and aires delight, But earth, nor aire, could answere her desire: Fortune? shee skornde: friendes? who durst be a foe? Seruants? a worlde would serue her will or no. Welth, was but trash, and health was natures ioie, Honour, a Title, beauty, but a blast: Power, but a trouble, pleasure, but a toie, Youth, but a time, to quickely ouerpast: Learning, alas, it liueth in her schoole, Wisedome, her will, knowes worldly wit a foole. Yet still she wisht, but saide not what shee woulde, When still the worlde, did worke, but still in vaine: Care with conceite, did all the best he coulde, Brought in his giftes, but bare them backe againe: When welth, helth, beauty, honor, power nor ease Wit, youth, nor learning, could her humor please. Some brought in pearles, most orient to beholde, Shee knew them pearles, and so did shee regarde them: Some brought in gemmes, of diamondes set in golde, Shee knew their worth and so did she rewarde them. Some brought in workes, of weomans rare deuises, She knew their paines, and so did giue the prices. Some brought in musicke of most siluer sounde, Which all woulde cease, if shee but tucht a string: Some brought in first the fairest flowers they founde, Shee tooke them as the comforts of the Spring: Some brought in this and some woulde bringe in that, But yet her wish was still shee knewe not what. The souldiers came, and brought in all their armes, Shee smilde to see, how beauty made a peace: The pesants came, and offred vp their farmes, But, shee saide loue did neuer make a lease: The merchants, came with all their mony treasure, Shee put it off, it did her minde no pleasure. The lawiers came, and laide downe all their bookes, Shee knew, that truth was all in yea and no: The courtiers came with all their lofty lookes, But when she lookt she made them curtzy low: The scholars came and brought in all their artes, Shee knew their practise ere they learned their partes. The sailers brought their rubies from the rockes, But, of such toies, her treasure was to full: The shepards brought the fairest of their flockes, But shee coulde weare no cloth was made of woll: Thus euery one did bring in what they coulde, Yet still she wisht, but knew not what shee woulde. The poets came, and brought in their inuentions, But well shee knew their fancies were but fained: The muses brought the truth of their intentions, Which in their kindes were kindely entertained: But yet the best, with all her worthines, Toucht not the humor of her happines. But when the world could not come neare her wish, And saw in vaine it was, her will to seeke: The earth coulde yeelde no fruite, the sea no fishe, That coulde be founde, that might her fancy leeke: Some with a sigh, other, with pitteous mone, All went awaie, and left her all alone. Now when she saw the worlde was gone indeede, Her selfe alone, saue but my selfe vnseene: Oh Loue quod she, this world is but a weede, Who liues on earth, that in the heauens hath beene? Thou knowest I know the world did know thee neuer. But I do know, heauens know, thou knowest th? euer. Thou art a name that nature neuer knew, Thou art a knowledge for the earth too high, Thou art the triall of affection true, Thou art the truth, that cannot make a lie, Thou art the sweete, that cannot be conceiued, Thou art the hope, that neuer harte deceiued. The Diamond is to thee but dimmèd glasse, Gold is but drosse, pearles are but fishes eies: The wisest head, to thee is but an Asse, What life so proud? but in thy presence dies: Thou art the Beauty that can neuer fade: Thou art the sunne, what euer be the shade. Thou leadest the eie vnto his harts delight, Thou leadest the hart vnto his soules desire, Thou leadest the soule vnto that liuing light, Which shewes the heauen wher hope can go no higher: Thou art the height aboue all heights so high, As giues the life, where loue can neuer die. And since I see, such is thy sacred Essence, As giues the being to each secret blisse: And vertue hath her highest excellence, In but performing what thy pleasure is: Some heauenly Muse, let my poore spirit moue, To make the world to wonder at my loue. Thy face my Loue, is fairer then the sunne: Thy beauty sweete, is brighter then the daie: Thy shining light before the world begunne, And cannot fade, though al the world decay: Where wisedome findes, in state of vertues story, The grace of Beauty hath her brightest glory. Thy wisedome doth all wonder comprehend, Thy valure is aboue all power victorious, Without beginning, and can neuer ende, Thy vertue is in heauen and earth al glorious: Thy prayses are aboue all praise raysèd, Where mercy is, in highest glory praysèd. Health is no health, but in thy happy hand, Life is but death, that thy loue doth not cherish, Earth hath no fruit except thou blesse the land, Thoughts prosper not wher thou wilt haue them perish, Power, is no power, but where thou doest assist, Downe goes the world, that doth thy will resist. Thy wil, sweete loue, is but the summe of wel, Thy well, is well, wel, better, and the best: That, with thy loue, thy liuing soules may dwell, Safe, in the hope of their eternal rest: Thy rest the ioie, the soule cannot conceiue, Thy soules, the Saintes, thy Mercy doth receiue. Thy comfort is the tuchstone of true kindenes, Thy kindenesse is the very life of loue: Thy loue is light, all other light but blindenesse, Thy light is life, that death can neuer proue: Thy death, was life, thy life is ioie for euer, Vnto the soules, that loue and leaue thee neuer. What was? or is? or, on the earth shall be, But that thou knowst, and knowst al what they are And that they haue, their beeing but in thee, Made by thy hande, and gouernd by thy care: Which thou dost prosper, comfort, or defende, And when thou wilt, shal wholy make an ende. Grast is the king, whom thou dost only crowne, And wise the wit, that only knowes thy wil, Happy the State, where thou dost blesse the towne, And blest, the hart, that thou dost keepe from ill: But yet the soule, doth in her faith approue The life, the life, is onely in thy loue. Shall I describe thy sweete and glorious seate? But, as thou art vnto thy seruants seene, Or shall my spirite humbly else entreate? Some Angels help, that in the heauens hath beene? That to the world such glory may vnfolde, Or, saie it is, too glorious to beholde. Thy throne is Iudgement, Iustice is thy sworde, Mercy and Truth are still before thy face: Loue, is thy law, and Wisedome is thy worde: Vertue thy loue, and Bounty is thy grace: Pitty thy state, where patience is the story, Grace is thy gift, and Mercy is thy glory. Thus in the seate of sacred excellence, With Virgins, Saints, and Angels all attended, Dost thou possesse that princely residence: Till Iudgement passe and Ioies be neuer ended, When all the host of heauen and heauens doth sing, An Alleluia, to their heauenly king. Where trembling Ioyes distill the teares of loue, And louing feare doeth bring forth blushing faces, And blushing faces, in their faith approue, Vnworthy creatures, to behold their graces. Which graces doe this glorious musicke moue, The life of life, is in thy heauenly loue. Now for thy loue, it cannot turne to hate, Thou hatest the life, that once doth alter loue: It is the staie of an eternall state, A mansion house, that neuer can remoue: Which, on the rocke of true Religion standes, And neuer feares the seas of errors sandes. Now, thy Religion is the rule of life, Whose chiefest blessing is the ioie of peace: Where loue, cuts of the cause of euery strife, And sweete accord, doth bring out loues encrease: And loues encrease is such a ioie to see, As bring the soule vnto his life in thee. Alas, alas, all treasure is but trashe, Where loue is banisht by the state of strife: The sweetest wine, is but as swinish wash, Vnto the water, of the well of life: No, no, the pleasures, that the world can proue, Are all but sorrowes to thy heaunly loue. But, let me see what fruite, thy fauour yeeldes, Or in thy loue, what happy life is founde. When sea, and lande, hils, dales, and fairest fieldes, Doe all, but in thy blessed giftes abounde: Besides the peace, wherewith the hart is blest, To bring the soule to thy eternall rest. Thou dost not ioie to see a sinners death, But true repentaunce pleaseth thee farre better: Yea, thou wilt helpe at latest gaspe of breath, To make the soule confesse it selfe thy debter: And where the soule, such comforts doth approue, Can there be thought a comfort like thy loue? No, no, this worlde is full of wanton toies, Which oft keepes backe the comfort of thy care: And many waies doth worke the harts anoies, When fortunes hope doth proue but heauy fare: Oh heauens, who knew but halfe thy blessednes, Woulde hate the worlde with all his wretchednes. Where shew of faith doth shape but falshods cloke, When fancies teares, proue drops of fonde desire: Where free conceites, will yeeld to kindenes yoke, When sorrow paies repentance for their hire: While in thy loue maie liuing faith vnfolde, Hart, may her hope, hope may her heauen beholde. What shadowes here doe ouershroude the eie? While Masking thoughts doe March before the winde: Where loues conceite, doth but illusion trie, When careles wit becometh the wilfull blinde, And Nature findes herselfe still misconceiued, Where forme, for matter hath the soule deceiued. Where night for daie, for light is darkenes taken, Treason for truth, and hate indeede for loue, Where death is followed, and the life forsaken, While ioies mistaken, doe but sorrowes proue: When in thy loue this life is sweete set downe, The faithfull soule receiues a roiall crowne. The swanne is white, but whiter is the snow, The daie is bright, but brighter is the sunne, But he that coulde but thy loues lustre know, And where the fire of phebus first begunne, Woulde saie, to see thy sweet loues shining brightnes, The sunne hath lost his light, the snow his whitenes. Fooles, of the earth (alas) could neuer know thee, And thou dost know, the wisest are but fooles: Thy glorious workes doe in such wonder, show thee, That greatest powers, are plashes to thy pooles: Height, depth, length, breedth, are in thy loue declared, Yet are they nothing to thy loue compared. Aboue all height, thy loue doeth liue on high, And who can sounde, the depth of thy loues treasure? Or limit out the length of thy loues eie, Which heauen and earth doth in thy mercy measure: No, let all height, depth, length, and bredth confesse, Thy loue is blessèd, in all blessednes. Thy loue giues light, vnto the inwarde eie, Thy loue giues life, vnto the dying hart: Thou giu'st, the comforte, that can neuer die, Thou giu'st, the comfort, that can neuer part: Thou giu'st, but all, that all in all doth proue, All, all, in all, is onely in thy loue. But, what shoulde I? shall I? or can I giue? To thee: for all, that thou hast giuen to me: Wh?, by thy loue, my soule doth only loue, And hath her being wholy but in thee: Nothing I haue, but, if that ought be mine, All doe I giue vnto that loue of thine. And though my sinnes, haue bard me of thy blessing, By great offences to thy grace diuine, Yet let my soule, with humble harts confessing, Purchase againe, that gratious loue of thine: And, let my teares vnto such pitty moue thee, That I may know, that thou dost know I loue thee. And while my soule doth to thine honor sing, The heauenly praises of thy holy name, Oh, let the sounde throughout the world so ring, That, olde and young, maie ioie to heare the same: And on our knees, al humbly fall before thee, With hart, and minde, and soule for to adore thee. Not that my wits can touch the smallest worth Of that high wonder worthines of thine: For, from a sinner, what can issue forth? And who more sinner then this soule of mine? Which doth with teares of true repentance moue, Thy gratious helpe to glorifie thy loue. For, as vnto the sea, a water droppe, And to the sandes, a little pibble stone, And as a corne, vnto a haruest croppe, And vnto infinite, the number one: So are my Muses in their Musicke short, Thy kingly prayse of prayses to report. But, as a scholer that doth goe to schoole, To make a letter, ere he learne to write, And as the wit, that knowes it selfe a foole, Till higher wisedome teach it to endite: So let my soule in her submission proue Hate of the world, and honour of thy loue. For, what is heere that can content the hart? That knowes content, or what it doth containe: What thought so sweete but brings as sowre a smart, Or pleasure such? but breedes a further paine: What thing so good? but proues in fine so euil, As, but for God, woulde beare men to the deuill. What is the Earth? the labour of our life, What is the sea? a gulfe of griezy lakes: What is the aire? a stuffe of filthy strife, What is the fire? the spoile of what it takes: When these are al, whence euery thing doth springe, What is the worlde? but euen a woful thing. What thing is man? a clodde of miry claie, Slime of the Earth, a slaue to filthie sinne: Springes like a weede and so doth weare awaie, Goes to the earth, where first he did beginne: Oh heauens thinke I, when man is wholy such, What is in man? that man shoulde loue so much. What hath the worlde, to leade the minde to loue? In true effect, a fardel ful of toies: Where, wey the pith, what euery one doth proue, The perfectst gems are most vnperfect ioies: Consider al what fansie bringeth forth, The best conceite will fal out nothing worth. What worldely thinges doe follow fansie most? Welth, beutie, loue, fine diet, honor, fame: What findes affect? both loue and labour lost, Disdaine, disease, dishonor, death, and shame: Where care, and sorrow, death, and deadly strife, Doe rule the rost, in this accursèd life. What thing is Beauty? colour quickely gon, And what is wealth? when riches fal to rust: What thing is loue? a toy to thinke vpon, Fine diet? drosse, to feede a filthy lust. What worldly honour? oft vnworthy praise, What ease? the cause whereby the life decaies. What is disdaine, the skorne of proud conceit, And what disease? the death of discontent: Dishonour next? the fruite of foule deceite, And what is death? but ende of ill intent: Now what is shame? a shamefull thing to tell, And thus the world but euen the way to hell. For beasts and birds, for fishes, flowers and trees, And al such things created for our vse: What thing is man? to take such things as theese, By want of grace, to turne vnto abuse: Oh wretched world, when man that should be best, In beastly things proues worse then al the rest. But when I see the wretched state of man, And al the world at such a woful passe: That since the course of humane care began, More ful of wo, good nature neuer was. When this my soule, doth with her sorrow see, Lord saies my Loue, that I might liue with thee. And leauing so the world with all his woes, And looking vp to heauen and heauenly ioies, And to the grace where vertues glory goes, Noting the life, that neuer loue anoies: When in my soule, I doe this sweetnes proue, Lord saies my soule, how sweet art thou my loue. I see the sunne, the beauty of the skie, The moone and stars, the candles of the night: They haue their essence in thy heauenly eie, That blindes the proude, and giues the humble light: I see the raine-bow, bended by thy hand, That doth both heauen, earth, sea and heauen command. Thou gauest the sunne, the moone and stars a course, Which they obserue according to thy will: Thou makest the tides to take their due recourse, And setst the Earth, where it doth settle stil. Thou framdst the substance of each Element, And settst thy foote vpon the firmament. Thus dost thou sitte in glory of thy throne, With al the hoast, of highest heauens attended: Who, in thine ire, hast kingdoms ouerthrowen And in thy loue hast little things defended: Whose glory more then may by man be knowen, And glory most, is in thy mercy showen. Thus thou dost sit in honor of thy power, Calling the poore vnto thy rich reliefe, Sowing the sweete, that killeth euery sower, Giuing the salue, that healeth euery griefe: Making them liue, that long were dead before, And liuing so, that they can die no more. Thou madst the worlde and what it doth containe. Onely but man, thou madst vnto thy loue: And mans good will was thy desirèd gaine, Till proude attempt did high displeasure moue: Thou plagst his pride, yet when thou sawst his paine, Thou gau'st the salue, that heald the wound againe. Vngratefull man, whom thou didst onely make, In loue to loue, and with thy loue preseruest, And for his loue, enduredst for his sake, Such death of life, as dearest loue deseruest: What cursèd hart woulde to displeasure moue thee, That giuing all, askes nothing but to loue thee. Oh loue, sweete loue, oh high and heauenly loue, The onely line, that leades to happy life: Oh loue, that liu'st, for louing harts behoue, And makst an ende of euery hatefull strife: Happy are they that kindely can attaine thee, And how accurst, that dare but to disdaine thee. Thy loue was cause, that first we were created, Loue is the life, that thou wilt haue vs leade: Loue is the cause, we neuer can be hated, Loue is our life, when other life is dead: Loue is thy grace, that highest good doth giue Loue me then lorde and I shall euer liue. And with that worde proceeding from her hart, The trickeling teares distillèd downe her eies: As if her sence possest in euery part, A secret ioie that did the soule suprise: When lifting vp her handes, oh loue quod shee, My soule is sicke she can not be with thee. And from the mercy of thy maiesty, Beholde the sorrowes of my wounded soule: Let pitties care of loues calamitie, My ruthfull teares, thy register enrowle: And thinke vpon the passions that I approue, For, truely, lorde, my soule is sicke of loue. And sicke it is, and so well maie it bee, A sweeter sickenes then a worldly health: A healthfull sickenes, to be sicke for thee, Where Natures want doth proue the spirits wealth While hart hath set her highest happines, But to beholde thee in thy holines. But, I am sicke, and sicke, in euery vaine, Sicke to the death, but not to die to thee: For why thy loue assures me life againe, And there to liue where death can neuer be: Oh sweetest sicknes, where the soule may see The way through death, to come to liue with thee. To liue with thee, oh euerliuing loue, Oh let me die, that I may liue no more, Till in thy loue, I may the life approue, That may confesse I neuer liu'de before: Life is but death where thy loue shineth neuer, Onely thy loue, is happy life for euer. My sinnes my sinnes with sorrow and with shame, Of faultes and follies couered haue my face: Death is my due, I haue deseru'd the same, Wo to the hart, in such vnhappy case: But if repentance mercy may obtaine, Looke on me loue, and I am well againe. Vnhappy hart, that euer thee offended, Vnworthy eies, thy blessings to beholde: Vncarefull eare, that euer tale attended, But to the truth that hath thy mercy tolde: Vnfaithful soule, that euer thought did moue From euerliuing, with thine onely loue. But, now the hart is dead to worldes delight, And eies in teares, pronounce repentance truth: The eare is deafe vntill the hart be right, To see the life, that of thy loue ensueth: The faithfull soule of pleasure is depriued, Dead, till her life, be by thy loue reuiued. Nor, let me tempt that truest loue of thine To hasten time beyonde thy holy will: But only looke, vpon this soule of mine, That in thy loue may be her liuing still: Till shee may heare this ioifull sounde of thee Come away loue, and euer liue with me. But, yet my loue, me seems I see thee looke, As though my soule had thee displeasèd sore: But, hath my loue so high displeasure tooke? That he will looke vpon my loue no more: Oh, yes, my loue will not be angry euer, And where he loues, he will be angry neuer. Then, though thou chide, yet be not angry loue, But in thy kindenes giue thy sweete correction, That humble hart maie in repentance proue, The dearest passage of thy loues direction: Whose blessed ende may in this only be, To liue to die, to die to liue to thee. To liue to thee, in thee, and but with thee, My dearest life, and onely truest loue: Where heauen and earth doe all the comfort see, That faithfull passions in the soule may proue: Come lambe, come loue, come ly betwixt my brests Where zealous loue, and true repentance rests. Some say sweete loue, there is a Phœnix birde, Of which there was, is, nor will be but one: Which Phœnix sure, I thinke is but a worde, For such a birde, I thinke is surely none: But that it doeth, in figure onelie tuch, Some heauenly thing; on earth was neuer such. For why the birde, is saied to bee alone, And thou didst male, and femall all create: And as for birdes were neuer two in one, That euer trueth in reason did relate: No, no, the figure surely doeth intende, More then the world can easily comprehend. They saie she hath a kinde of fiery vaine, For that she liues and dies but in the sunne, Consumes with heat, and so reuiues againe, But, by the heate, whereby her death begunne: Which str?ge conceit makes me c?iecture this Some high construction of the figure is. And high it is, that to the heauens doth reach, And heauen it is, that such a reach intendeth, And high intent, doeth such a reason teach, That onely faith this figure comprehendeth: When in thy passion patience doth approue, The rising life, of euerliuing loue. For by the sunne, is surely vertue ment, Which doth enflame the soule with sacred loue: The flying high, the faithfull hearts intent Where loue must worke, but for the liues behoue: The ashes, are olde Adam, dead and gon, The new life, Christ, thy loue anew put on. And didst thou die, to compasse thy desire? And thy desire, but to preserue thy loue? And, could in thee, loue, kindle such a fier? To leaue thy life? thy constant loue to proue? Then of thy loue, let this the figure be, If euer there were Phœnix, thou art he. And since thou didst, that sweete example giue, By thine owne death to show thy dearest loue: That we might learne the onely way to liue, Is, by thy crosses comforts to approue: Oh let my soule, beseech her sacred rest, But in the ashes of the Phœnix nest. Me thinkes, I see, that glorious seate of thine, Whereto thy Saints and Angels al assemble, And in the presence of thy power diuine, With ioifull feare, how euen the highest tremble: And when those spirits, doe such passions proue, Shall I presume, to think vpon thy loue? Oh sweetest loue, that carries such a force, As keepes the hart of humble hope in awe: And sweete againe, that caries such remorse, As hath cut off, the curses of the lawe: And sweetest yit, that in the soule doth proue There is no sweete indeede, but in thy loue. Which feeds the h?gry with a heauenly bread, And cooles the thirsty from the liuing Rocke, Which heales the sicke, giues life vnto the dead, And wakes the careful, with the morning cocke: Which breedes the peace, that stinteth euery strife, And giues the fountaine of the well of life. It is the key that opes the doore of grace, Vnto the care that thou hast constant proued, And shewes the fauour of thy shining face, Vnto the blessed of thy deare beloued: It is in summe, the infinite sweete pleasure, Of tried faith, and true Repentance treasure. Oh ioy of ioies, what hart can comprehend thee? Oh sweete of sweets, what sence that can c?ceiue thee? Blest be the harts that truly doe attend thee, And ten times blest, that in their soules receiue thee: And fairely blest, whom thou hast faithful proued, But chiefly blest whom thou hast chiefly loued. Me thinkes I see, how sweetly thou dost ride, Aboue the heauens, vpon the Cherubs high, With all thine angels set on euery side, With all the sound of sweetest harmony: Where all and some, their sweetest notes do frame To sing the praises of thy holy name. Me thinkes I see the holy Martyrs crowned, On h?ble knees cast down their crowns before thee: And cry alowd, be thou alone renowned, Let heauen and earth, and all the world adore thee. When, my poore soule, with sinne oppressèd sore, Can say Amen yet, though it say no more. Oh that my soule could see that sacred light, That might but leade me to thy holy will, And learne the rule, that keepes the soule aright, In perfect faith thy precepts to fulfill: And might so neere vnto thy hand abide, As from thy loue, might neuer steppe aside. But, what am I? a worme and wretched thing, Vnworthy creature, made of earth and claie: Once to presume to speak vnto my King, On whom the state of highest heauens doth staie: Let no presumption thy displeasure moue, But in thy pitty looke vpon my loue. For I am sicke, oh Sauiour sende me health, My hart is hurt, come heale my deadly wounde: And I am poore, relieue me with thy wealth, Yea, I am dead, oh raise me from the grounde: My health, my wealth, my only resurrection, Let my soule liue, but in thy loues perfection. Beholde the teares of my repentaunt truth, And wey my sorrowes, by my sighing sobbes: And in the rule but of thy heauenly ruth, Feele my poore hart, in horror how it throbbes: And when thou seest my soule thus wo begun her. In thy sweete mercy, sweet loue looke vpon her. And from the dew of thy deare blessed loue, Let fall one droppe vpon my drièd hart: Wherein my soule such comfort may approue, As may asswage the rigour of my smart: And being so by thy sweete hand relieued, Maie so reioice, as neuer more be grieued. Lorde who dare looke against thy liuing power? Or what doth liue? but onely in thy loue: The sweete of sweets where there was neuer sower, But ioies of ioies, that can no sorrow proue: Oh purest proofe, of loue and lifes perfection, Blest be the soule, that liues by thy direction. But my heart pantes, my soule doth quake for feare, And sorrowes paine possesseth euery part: My heape of sinnes, to heuy for to beare, Presse downe desire with terror of desart: And in great dread, of deepe dispaire doth crie, Grace giue me life, for in my sinnes I die. For still the flesh is subiect to offende, While yet the spirit, groneth for thy grace: But thou hast power the weakest to defende, That vnto thee, reueale their heauy case: Then from that hande, and mighty arme of thine, Strengthen, this weake and wounded soule of mine. Thou that hast saide prowde Esaw was thy hate, And humble Iacob, was thy chosen loue: That doth the power of worldly pride abate, And workst the heauen of humble hartes behoue: Make Esawes life with Iacobs loue agree: Or kill the flesh, the soule maie liue with thee. And from despaire, that poisned sting of death, Deliuer Lorde, the sorrowes of desire: And at the latest houre, and gaspe of breath, Let humble hart, the hope of heauen aspire: Where faithfull soules maie in thy fauour see, That onely loue, doth onely liue in thee. What booteth me the worlde for to possesse, And want the iewell of my heauenly ioie: What earths delight? but is to me distresse, When natures health, doth proue the soules anoye: No, my sweete loue, let this poore soule of mine, Neuer haue life, but in that loue of thine. One precious droppe of thy pure oill of grace, Power downe, sweete loue into my wounded hart: And to my faith, to turne thy louing face, That from thy fauour I maie neuer part: Looke on thy Mary with her bitter teares, That washt thy feete and wipte them with her heares. The greater depts forgiuen, the greater loue, Thy worde hath saide, and it saies euer true: When patience life, in pitties loue doth proue, In greatest mercy, greatest glory grue: Where one mans sinne procurèd all mens paine, And one mans grace, gaue all men life againe. Oh high creator of all creatures liuing, Who nothing wantst that all thinges dost possesse What hath the world that may be worth the giuing. Vnto the honor of thy holines: But onely thankes, that thy true spirit moueth, In that true hart, that thy true mercy loueth. But still I see my loue is sore displeasde, And tels me of my great vngratefulnes, When so my soule, with sorrow is diseasde, As in my hart, findes nought but hatefulnes: And with the teares of true repentance crieth, Lorde saue the life, that in thy mercy lieth. For, thou art loue, the euerliuing God, And onely God and onely of the liuing, Who, though thou smitst thy children with thy rod. Sweete is the care of thy corrections giuing: In which thy sweete and kindest care correct me. But in thy mercy, neuer doe reiect me. Let neuer death against thy life preuaile, Nor euer hate, once looke against thy loue, Nor faithfull hope thy heauenly fauour faile, But harts contrition happy comfort proue: And let the soule, euen at the dore of death, Liue by the aier but of thy heauenly breath Mine eies are dimme, my flesh, bare skin and bone, My sinewes shroncke, and all my limmes are num, Mine eares are deafe, but to the sound of mone, My speech, is but to sorrow stroken dum: My blood dried vp, my heart with sorrow soken, Oh helpe the soule, before the heart be broken. Behold the sorrowes, that my soule doeth make, And see what torments teare my heart asunder, Where euery teare, doth other ouertake, Where fearefull care, puts faithfull comforts vnder: Oh my sweete life though I be deadly wounded, Let not my faith be vtterly confounded. And since oh king, that thou art onely able, To helpe the helples, onely but in thee, And by one crumme, from thy true mercies table, The wofull soule may well relieuèd be: Of that sweete foode, oh let my faith so tast, That by thy loue, my life may euer last. What life is this, that wretches here we leade? Caring and carking for our fleshly liues, Neuer wel fild, when we are too much fedde, Where strange conceits for true contentment striues: Tearing our harts, and tiring out our minds, For that, in fine, which but repentance findes, Where kindnes proues a kinde of leude conceite, Leading the heart to lothsomnes of loue, While wisest wits on wanton humours waite, And wilfull fancies doe but follies proue: Where power and pride, so plage the world with woes, That peace and vertue, all to ruine goes. Where gold is helde a God, siluer a Saint, And durt and drosse, are dearest in regarde: Where friendship failes, and faith beginnes to faint, And curses rule, while blessed thoughts are barde: And all and some, doe in conclusion proue, Wo to the world, that liues not by thy loue. Where valure proues but foolish hardines, And greatest wit, is wicked wilines, And honour gotten by vnworthines, Fils all the world with all vnhappines, While vertue sighes, at sinners wickednes, And Angels mourne for our vngodlines. Where parents griue at childrens stubbornes, And children smile, at parents childishnes, Where masters sigh, at seruants idlenes, And seruants laugh at masters wantonnes, While faithfull soules in sorrowes wretchednes, Looke but in heauen to haue their blessednes. Where subtle heads, are simple harts illusion, While tyraunt thoughts vniustly make intrusion, And outward shewes, are inward thoughts allusion, While strange delightes, are strong desires delusion: And heedles care, doeth make vp this conclusion, That lacke of grace, is all the worlds confusion. Where brightest truth, by treason often blamed is, While faithles hart, with falshood all inflamed is, And carefull age, with sorrow all ashamed is, That careles youth so long at large vntamed is, That, where good nature, all (alas) misnamed is, The faith of honour, vtterlie defamed is. Where sore decaies the care of true Gentility, And strong disquiet standeth for tranquility, And vertue is of too much imbecility: Where faith is found but ful of al fragility, When honors loue, that liues by hopes humility, Must walke among the beggars for ability. Oh wicked fruit, of woful hearts affection, When once the soule is toucht by sins infection, And wil not learne, by care of thy correction, To leade a life, but by thy loues direction, Where in the fire of thy bright sunnes reflexion, They maie behold of height of their perfection, But, what is Earth? and what but earth are we? A goodly brag, begunne and endes in dust, Where old and young, and all the world may see, From whence we came, and whetherto we must: Short time we liue, no sooner dead then rotten, And scarce wel buried, but wee are forgotten. O Lord thou knowest, this world is all but wo, Where sinne doth seeke to get the vpper hand: The flesh would faine the spirit ouerthrow, But that her stay doth in thy mercy stand: But, since the soule may conquer sinne by thee, Lord let thy mercy onely fight for me. Let me but looke vpon thy holie loue, And sucke my honie from that heauenlie hiue: Wherein my soule such sweetnes maie approue, That with that foode shee maie for euer liue: And feeding so vpon thy sacred will, When shee is fedde, yet maie shee hunger still. Oh bring me home, that long haue beene abroade, And leade me streight, that long haue gone astraie: And raise me vp that haue beene ouertroade, And on thy mercie, let me onlie staie: That my poore soule, maie in thy comfort proue Lo, what it is, to liue but in thy loue. Some wish for golde, and some for golden graces, Some wish for wit, and some for worldely pleasure, Some wish for power, and some for stately places, And some, alone, doe wish for worldely treasure: But, let my will, those wishes all displace, And wish alone, thy fauour, and thy grace. Some in their chariots, some in horses trust, But, be thou still a strong defence to me: Some heere desire but to possesse their lust, Let my soules loue, be but to liue to thee: Some wish, but here to purchase worldly fame, Let me but ioie, to glorify thy name. And not, alone in sweetest wordes to moue, The worldly eares to wonder at the same: But in my workes thy praises I maie proue, I doe but seeke the honour of thy name: That all true soules maie iustly saie with me, All that is good, directly comes of thee. Let me but tuch the garment of thy grace, I shall be healèd of my sickest sore: let me but looke vpon thy louing face, Such health will come, I shall be sicke no more: Yea, if thy mercy mitigate my paine, If I were dead; I should reuiue againe. Forget, oh lorde the follies of my youth, And giue me not the death of my desart. But of the treasures of thy heauenly Truth, Bestow an almès on my needy hart: That in the secrets of thy sacred loue My carefull soule, her comfort may approue. Let not mine eare once listen to the sounde Of vaine conceits, that but deceiue the minde, Nor, let the worlde so giue my hart a wounde, That, in my soule, mine eie be stroken blinde: But, let my spirit onely make her choise, But, in thy loue and mercy to reioice. Oh, that my waies, were all and whole directed, Vnto the seruice of thy sacred will, And, that my faith, had in my soule effected, The happy comfort, of that heauenly skill: That, in true loue, might euer so attende thee, As, in default, might neuer more offende thee. That I might leaue this lothsome world of ours, And chuse the honor of thy children awe, And in thy heauen, and with thy heauenly powers, Learne, but obedience to thy blessed lawe: And with thy Saints and holy Martyrs sing, All lawde, and glory to my heauenly king. Then, should my hart finde out my heauenly rest, And sorrow then should tuch my soule no more, But hart and soule, both in thy mercie blest, Should daie and night thy holy name adore: And make the worlde, by some effectes to see, It is thy loue hath wrought this life in me. And with that worde, she sweetly fetcht, a sigh, And then a sobbe, and then a bitter teare, As who should saie, that either death was nigh, Or else her hart, was stroken with a feare, Or else the spirit might be ouercome, That for the time her tongue was stroken dumme. But, let it be, all blessed is the traunce, When so the soule is ouercome with loue, That vertues choice, doth finde it is no chaunce, When humble faith doth heaunly fauour proue: And when the sences from their sleepe arise, The spirit findes the life that neuer dies. So, when it seemde shee wakèd from her sleepe, Or sodaine traunce, for so I tearme it right, When such high care did so her sences keepe, That shee awakt, with glory of the light: Oh sacred loue, and sweetest life, quod shee, What happy figure hath appearde to me? Did I beholde, that fairest shining light? That made me shake for feare to see thy face, And weepe for ioie, that in thy blessed sight, My sinfull soule, might come, and sue for grace: And did I see thy loue so sweetely vse mee? That, in thy mercy thou wouldst not refuse me. And did thy mercy so thy loue entreate? That iustice gaue her sworde to mercies hande, And did thy mercy sit in iustice seate? And did the iudgement in thy mercie stande? Oh blessed loue, where mercie doth approue, The fruite of loue, is mercie, mercies loue. I must confesse my conscience did condemme me Of such offence, as I could not denie: And of such crime, as thou mightst well cont?ne me, When by my due, I had deseru'd to die: But when thy mercy did my sorrowe see, How in thy pitty she did pleade for me. Beholde, quod shee, the true repentant hart, Which bleedes in teares with sorrowe of her sinne: What passions haue perplexèd euery part, Where penitence doth pitties suite beginne: Where true confession, doth submission proue, And true contrition, cries to me for loue. Beholde the faith that hath her fairest holde, Vpon the gift of thy especiall grace: Thy word of truth, that to the world hath told The faithful soule, in heauen shall haue a place: And true repentance shall by me obtaine, The freèd ioyes from euerlasting paine. When that vile serpent, euery soule accuser, That sought to bring my comforts to decay: That ougly deuil, al the worldes abuser, In furies rage, methought did fly awaie: And to the life, but of thy mercy leaue me, Who to thy seruice, sweetely did receiue me. When all thy Saintes, and martyrs came vnto me, And in their armes thine Angels did embrace me, And all were glad what comfort they could doe me, And in a seate of paradise to place me: That al with ioie surprisde these ioies to see, I wake, and praie the vision true may bee. For, this is it, sweete Lorde, that I woulde haue, The world is short, in sounding my desire: It is thy mercy that I onlie craue, Thy vertues loue, that set my hart on fire; And in thy loue, that onely liuing blisse, That world may wish, but know not what it is.

      <field name="fulltext">The Countesse of Penbrook's Passion. 1 Where shall I finde that melancholy muse That never hard of any thinge but mone? And reade the passiones that her pen doth use, When she and sorrow sadlye sitt alone; To tell the world more then the world can tell? What fits, inded most fitlye figure hell. 2 Lett me not thinke once of the smalest thought, Ne speake of less then of the greatest gref; Wher every sence with sorrowes overwrought, Lives but in death, dispayring of relef; Whilst thus the harte with torments torne asunder, Maye of the worlde be cald the wofull wonder. 3 The dayes like nights all darkned by distresse, Pleasure become a subject all of payne; The spirit overprest with heaviness, While hopelesse horror vexeth every vayne; Death shakes his darte, Grief hath my grave prepared Yett to more sorrowe is my spirit spared. 4 The owlie eyes that not endure the light, The night-raven's songe, that sounds of nought but death, The cockatrice that kileth with her sight, The poysned ayre, that chokes the sweetest breath, Thunders and earthquakes, altogether mett; These tell a litle how my life is sett. 5 Where words desolve to sighes, sighes into teares, And everye teare to torments of the mynde; The mynd's distresse into those deadlye feares, That finde more death, than death it selfe can finde; Death to that life, that livinge doth descrye, A litle more yett of my myserye. 6 Put all the woes of all the worlde together, Sorrow and Death sitt downe in all ther pryde; Lett Miserye bringe all her muses hether, With all the horrors that the harte may hyde; Then reade the state but of my rufull storye, And saye my gref hath gotten sorrowe's glorye. 7 For nature's sicknes sometime maye have ease, Fortune, though fickle, sometime is a friende; The mynde's affliction patience maye appease, And death is cawse that manye torments ende; But ever sicke, crost, grevid and livinge-dyinge, Thinke of the subject in this sorrowe lyinge. 8 To shew the nature of my payne, alas! Payne hath no nature to descrye my payne; But where that payne it selfe in payne doth passe, Thinke on vexation so in every vayne, That hopeles, helples, endles payne may tell: Save hell it selfe, but myne, ther is no hell. 9 If sicknes be a ground of deadlye grefe, Consuminge care hath caught me by the harte; If wante of comforte, hopeles of relef, Be further woe: so weye my inwarde smarte; If friendes unkindenes, so my gref is grounded; If cawsles wronged, so my harte is wounded. 10 If love refused, so reade on my ruine, If truth disgrac'd, so my sorrow moved; If fayth abused, the ground my torment grew in, If vertue scorned, so my death approved; If death delayinge, so my harte perplexed, If livinge-dyinge, so my spirite vexed. 11 My infant's yeares myspente in childishe toyes, My riper age in rules of litle reasone; My better yeares in all mistaken joyes, My present time,—Oh most unhapie seasone!— In fruiteles labours and in ruthles love: Oh what a horror hath my harte to prove. 12 I sighe to se my infancie myspent, I morne to finde my youthfull life misled; I weepe to feele my further discontent, I dye to trye how love is livinge dead; I sighe, I morne, I weepe, I livinge dye, And yett must live to shew more miserye. 13 The hunted harte sometymes doth leave the hound, My harte, alas, is never out of chase; The lime-hound's lyne sometymes is yett unbound, My bands are hopelesse of so high a grace; Sumer restores what Winter doth deprive, But my harte wythred, never can revive. 14 I cannot figure Sorrow in conceite, Sorrow exceedes all figures of her sence; But on my woe, even sorrowes all may wayte, To see a note exceed their excellence; Let me conclude, to se how I am wounded, Sorrow herself is in herself confounded. 15 But whereof groweth the passion of this payne, That thus perplexeth every inwarde parte? Whence is the humore of this hatefull vayne So dampes the spirite and consumes the harte? Oh lett my soule with bitter teares confesse, It is the grounde of all unhapines. 16 If lacke of wealth? I am the note of need, If lacke of friendes? no fayth on earthe remaynes; If lacke of health? se how my harte doth bleed, If lacke of pleasure? looke upon my paynes: If lacke of wealth, of friendes, of health, and pleasure Saye then my sorrowe must be out of measure. 17 Measure? no measure measure can my thought, But that one thought that is beyonde all measure; Which knowinge how my sorrowes have been wrought, Can bring my harte unto her highest pleasure; Which eyther must my Sorrow cutt of quite, Or never lett me thinke upon delight. 18 Ther is a lacke that tels me of a life, Ther is a losse that tels me of a love; Betwixt them both a state of such a strife As makes my spirite such a passion prove; That lacke of t'one, and th' other's losse, alas! Makes me the woefulest wretche that ever was. 19 My dearest love, that dearest bought my love, My onlye life, by whom I onlye live; Was never fayth did suche affection prove, Or ever grace did such a glorie give; But such a lacke, and suche a losse, aye me! Must neds the sorrowe of all sorrowes be. 20 My love is fayre, yea fayrer then the sune, Which hath his light but from his fayrest love; O fayrest love, whose light is never done, And fayrest light doth such a love approve; But suche love loste, and suche a light obscured, Can ther a greater sorrow be indured? 21 He came from highe to live with me belowe, He gave me life and shewed me greatest love; Unworthy I so high a worth to knowe, Who left chefe blisse, a baser choyse to prove; I sawe his woundes, yet did I not beleve him, And for his goodnes with my synnes did greve him. 22 I sawe him faultles, yett I did offend him, I sawe him wronged, yett did not excuse him; I sawe his foes, yet sought not to defend him, I had his blissinges, yett I did abuse him: But was it myne, or my forfathers' deed? Whose ere it was, it makes my harte to bleed. 23 To se the feett, that travayled for our good, To se the hands, that brake the livlye bread; To se the head, wheron our honor stoode, To se the fruite, wheron our spirits fedd: Feete pearc'd, hands bored, and his heade all bledinge, Who doth not die with suche a sorrowe readinge. 24 He plast all rest, yett had no restinge place, He healed ech payne, yett lived in sore distres; Deserved all good, yett driven to great disgrace, Gave all harts joye, himself in heavines; Suffered them live, by whom himself was slayne, Lord! who can live to se such love agayne? 25 A virgine's child by vertue's power conceyved, A harmles man that lived for all mene's goode; A faythfull frend that never fayth deceyved, An heavenly fruite for hart's especiall food, A spirite all of excellence devine; Such is the essence of this love of myne. 26 Whos mansion's heaven, yett laye within a manger, Who gave all foode, yett suckte a virgine's breste; Who could have kiled yett fledd a threatned danger, Who sought our quiet by his owne unrest; Who died for them that highly did offend him, And lives for them that cannot comprehend him. 27 Who cam no further than his Father sent him, And did fulfill but what He did commande him; Who prayed for them that proudley did torment him, For tellinge truth to what they did demand him; Who did all good that humblie did entreat hime, And beare ther blowes, that did unkindlie beat hime. 28 A sweet phisicion for the bodye crazed, A heavenlye medicine for the mynd diseased; A present comfort for the witts amazed, A joyefull spirit to the soule displeased: The bodie, mynd, the witts, and spiritts' joye, What is the world without him but annoye. 29 He knewe the sicknes that our soule infected, And that his bloude must onelye be our cure; When so our fayth his sacred love affected, That for our lives he would a death endure; He knew his passion, yett his patience bare it, Oh! how my soule doth sorrowe to declare it. 30 He heal'd the sicke, gave sight unto the blinde, Speache to the dumbe, and made the lame to goe; Unto his love he never was unkinde, He loved his frende, and he forgave his foe, And last, his death for our love not refused: What soule can live to se such love abused. 31 To note his words, whatt wisedome they contayne! To note his wisedome of all worth the wonder; To note his workes, what glorie they do gayne! To note his worth, world, heaven and earth, came under; To note the glorye that his angells gave hime: Fye that the world to suche disgrace should drive hime. 32 Unsene he came, he might be sene unto us, Unwelcome sem'd, that came for all our wealth; He came to die, that he might comfort do us; We slewe the subjecte of our spirits' healthe; The subject? noe, the kinge of all our glorie: Weepe harte to death to tell the dolfull storye. 33 A lion wher his force should be effected, And yett a lambe in myldnes of his love; As true as turtle to his love electted, Sure as Mounte Sion that can never move: So mylde a strength and so fast truth to prove; What soule can live and lacke so sweet a love. 34 He preacht, he prayed, he fasted, and he wept, The sweet Creator for the synfull creature; The carefull watchman warelye he kepte, That brake the necke, even of the fowlest nature; And when he did to hapie state restore us, Shall we not weep to make him then abhore us? 35 To hate a love, must argue lothsume nature; To wronge a frend must prove too foule a deed; To kill thyself will show a cursed creature; To slaye thy soule no more damnation nede; To spoile the fruite whereon thy spirit feedeth; Oh what a hell within the soule it bredeth. 36 He thought none ill, and onlie did all goode, He gave all right and yett all wronge receyved; The fiende's temptatione stoutley he withstood, Yett lett himself by synners be deceyved; And so at last when he was woe begone him, Howe trayter worlde did tiranyze upon hime! 37 His faultles members nayled to the crosse, His holye head was crowned all with thornes; His garments given by lots to gayne or losse, His power derided all with scofes and scornes; His bodie wounded and his spirit vexed: To thinke on this what soule is not perplexed? 38 Pore Peter wept when he his name denyed, And Marye Mawdlen wept for her offence; His mother wept when she his death espied, But yett no teares could stand for his defence; But if thes wept to see his waylefull case; Why dye not I to thinke on his disgrace? 39 Happie was he that suffred deaths so nighe hime That at his end repentance might behould hime; Thrise hapie life that did in love so trie hime, As to his fayth such favour did vnfould hime, As cravinge comforte but in mercie's eyes That selfe-same daye did live in paradise. 40 Would I had ben ordeynd to suche a death, To dye with hime, to live to hime for ever! And from the ayre but of his blissed breath, To sucke the life whos love might fayle me never! And drinke of that sweet springe that never wasteth, And feede of that life's bread that ever lasteth! 41 Oh would my soule wer made a sea of teares, Myn eyes might watch, and never more be sleapinge; My harte might beare the payne all pleasur weares, So I might se hime once yett in my weepinge; When, joyfull voyce, this songe might never cease: My Savioure's sight hath sett my soule in peace. 42 Should I esteme of anye worldlie toye, That might behould the height of suche a treasure? Could I be Judas to my chefest joye, To gayne possession of a graceless pleasure? Noe! could my soule in comforte once conceyve hime, I hope his mercye would not lett me leave hime. 43 Blest was the fishe that but the figure swallowed, Of my swete Jesus, but in Jonas' name; More blessed tombe by that sweet bodie hallowed, From whence the ground of all our glorie came; Might not my soule be synner, I could wish, That I were suche a tombe or such a fishe. 44 But Jonas left the sea, and came to lande, And Jesus from the earth to heaven ascended; Why shoulde I then upon more wishes stande, But crye for mercye wher I have offended; And saye my soule unworthye is the place Ever to see my Savioure in the face. 45 Yett lett me not dispayre of my desire, Although even hell do answer my desarte; Where humble hope that pitie doth aspire, Proves patience the pacifyinge parte; Wher mercye sweet that sees my soule's behavioure, Maye graunte me grace to se and serve my Savioure. 46 Whom till I see in sorrowe's endles anguish, All discontent with all that I can see, Resolv'd in soule, in sorrowe's looke to languish, Wher no conceit but discontent may be; I will sitt downe, till after this world's hell, My Saviour's sight maye only make me welle. 47 But shall I so my gryping grief give over, With hope to se the glorie of my sight? Or can my soule her sacred health recover While no desarte doth looke upon delighte? No, no, my harte is too, too full of grefe, For ever thinkinge to receyve relefe. 48 The sune is downe, the glorie of the daye; The Springe is paste, the sweetnes of the yeare; The harvest in, wherein my hope did staye, And wethering Winter gives her chillinge cheare; And what such grefe can death or sorrowe give, To see his death wherby his soule doth live? 49 Methinkes I se, and seinge sighe to see, How in his pasion patience playes her parte: And in his death, what life he gives to me, In my love's sorrowe to relive my harte. But what a care doth this conclusion trie, The head must of, or els the bodie dye. 50 He was my head, my hope, my harte, my health, The speciall jewell of my spiritt's joye; The trustie treasure of my highest wealth, The onlye pleasure kept me from annoye; He was, and is, and ever more shalbee, In life or death, the life of life to me. 51 And lett me se how sweetelie yett he lookes, Even while the teares are trickling downe his face; And for my life how well his death he brookes, While my desarte was cawse of his disgrace; And lett me wishe yett while his death I see, I could have dyed for hime that dyed for me. 52 Had I but sene him as his servantes did, At sea, at land, in citie, and in fielde; Though in himselfe he had the glorie hid, That in his grace the light of glorie helde; Then might my sorrowe somewhatt be appeased, That once my soule had in his sight ben pleased. 53 But not to se him till I se him dye, And that my deed was cawser of his death; How can I cease to weepe and howle and crye, To se the gaspinge of that glorious breath? That purest love unto the soule approved, And is the blissinge of the soule beloved. 54 Am I not one of that unhapie broode, The pellican doth figure in her neste? When I muste live but by his only bloode; In whose sweet love, my life doth only rest. O wretched bird, but I more wretched creature To figure such a birde in such a nature. 55 Did God himself ordayne it should be so, To save my life my Saviour should die? His will be done, yett lett me weep for woe, To be the subject of this miserie; That though he came to mende what was amise. He should be so the author of my blisse. 56 Shall I not wash his bodie with my teares, And save the blood that issues from his syde? That keeps my harte from all infernall feares, Unto my soule in penitence applied? Shall I not strive with Joseph for his corse, And make his tombe in my soule's true remorse? 57 Shall I not curse those hatefull hellish fiends, That led the worlde to worke such wickednes? And hate all them that have not ben his friends, But followed on that work of wretchednes? Cut of the head, firste hands upon him layde, And helpe to hange the dog that hime betrayed? 58 Shall I not drive the watchmen from the grave, And watche the risinge of the sune renowned? Or goe myself alsoe into the cave, To kisse the bodie wher it lies entombed? What shall I doe? or shall I not approve, For my soule's health that so my soule did love? 59 O love! the ground of life; oh livlye love! Why doe I live that did not dye with the[e]. When in my harte I do such horror prove, As lets mye care no thought of comforte see? How my poore soule might once such service do the[e], To give me hope how I might come unto the[e]. 60 No, I have rune the waye of wickednes, Forgettinge that my fayth should follow moste; I did not thinke upon thy holines, Nor by my syne what sweetnes I have loste: Oh syne, so close hath compaste me aboute, That, Lord, I knowe not wher to finde the[e] out. 61 If in the heaven, it is too highe a place, For wicked harte to hope to clime so highe; If in the worlde, the earth is all too base, To entertayne thy glorious majestie; If in thy Word, unworthy I to read So sweet a senc to stande my soule in stead. 62 If in my harte, syne sayth, thou arte not there, If in my soule, it is too foule infected; If in my hope, it is too full of feare, And fearefull love hath never fayth elected: In soule nor bodye, hope nor feare! Aye me! Wher should I seeke wher my soule's love may be? 63 Alas the daye that ever I was borne, To se how synne hath bar'd me from my blisse! And that my soule is so in torments torne, To knowe my love, and com not where he is: O yet, if ever heavens hearde creature crie, Lord, looke a litle on my miserey! 64 Let mercy plead in true repentante's cawse, Wher humble prayre may heavenlye pitye move; That though my life hath broken sacred lawes, My hart's contrition yett may comfort prove; That till my soule maye my sweet Savioure see, Mercey may caste one lovinge looke on me. 65 And while I sitt with Marye, at the grave, As full of grefe as ever love maye live; My wounded harte som sparke of hope may have, Of such relefe as glorious hand may give; To make me fele, though syne hath death deserved, In heaven for me there is a place reserved. 66 Which sacred truth untill my soule doth taste, To slake the sorrowe of this harte of myne; My wearye life in wofull thought must waste, While soule and bodye humblie I resigne Unto those glorious holye hands of his; Who is the hope of my eternall blisse. 67 Butt can I leave to thinke upon the thinge, That I can never put out of my thought? Or can I cease of his sweet love to singe, Who by his blood his creature's comfort wrought? Or can I live to thinke that he should dye In whom the hope of all my life doth lye? 68 No, lett me thinke upon his life and death, And after death his ever-life agayne; He breathed our life, and giving up his breath, Revived our soules that in our synes were slayne: His life so good, as never death deserved, And by his death our ever-lives preserved. 69 Did he not wash his pore Apostles' feett? Cam he not rydinge on a sillye asse? Did he not heale the criples in the streett? And feed a world whear litle victaull was? Did not his love most true affection trie? To dye for us that we maye never dye? 70 Was never infant shewed such humblenes, Was never man did speake as this man did; Was never lover shewed such faithfullness, Was never trew man, such a torture bid; Was never state continwed such a storie, Was never angel worthy such a glorie. 71 Oh glorious glorie, in all glorie glorious! Angels rejoyced at his incarnation; O powerfull vertue, of all pow'r victoriows! In true redemption of his best creation. O glorious life that made the divels wonder! Oh glorious death that trode the divels under! 72 Thus in his birth, his life, his death, all glorie He did receyve, who was himself the same; The statlye substaunce of that sacred storie, From whence the ground of highest glorie came; Whom highest power to highest glorie raysed, And all the hoste of heaven with glorie praysed. 73 Was ever such a gratitude approved, Since heaven and earth for man, and man was made? For onlye God, who held him his beloved, Till graceles syne did make his glorie fade; That he whom angels with such reverenc used Should be by man so cruellye abused. 74 O livlye image of thy Father's love! O lovlye image of the Father's life! O pure conceite that doth this concord prove! That all augmented breeds no thought of stryfe! But that the Sonne in state of all the storye, Is found the brightnes of the Father's glorie. 75 Could ever such a glorie be refused, By those that wer in dutie to adore it? Or could so great a glorie be abused, When angels tremble when they stand afore it? Oh man, woe man! to wounde thy soule so sore, To lose thy glorie so for ever more. 76 Behould the heavens what sorrowe they did shewe, And how the earth her doller did discrie! The sune was darke, and in the earth belowe, The buried bodies shewed their agonye; The Temple rent, the heavens with anger moved, To se the death of the divine beloved. 77 And yett thou man, fulle litle didst regarde What thou hadst done unto thy dearest love; Thou madest more reckninge of the worlde's rewarde Then of the blissinge of thy soule's behove; But wretched man, descend into thy thought, And with thy sorrowe weare thyself to nought. 78 Yett some ther were, to[o] smalle a some wer they, That joyed to see the sume of all ther joye; They watched the night, and walked in the daye, And wer not choked with the world's anoye; But followed on ther heavenly love alone: Would God in heaven, that I were such a one. 79 But aye me, wretch, all wretched as I am, Unworthye all to followe such a friend; In sweet rememberaunce of whos sweetest name, The joyes begine, that never make an end; Lett me butt weep, and sorrowe, till I see How mercye's love will cast one looke on me. 80 And lett me heare but what my Savioure sayth; ‘He once did die that I might ever live;’ And that my soule by her assuréd fayth May feele the comforte that His grace doth give; That for his love, who sorrowes here so sore, May joye in heaven, and never sorrowe more. 81 O joye above all joyes that ever were! Coulde I conceyve but half thyne excellence, Or howe to hope to have attendaunce there, Where thou dost keepe thy royall residence; And on my knees thy holye name adore; Wer my soule well, she should desyre no more. 82 To se the daye that from on high is springinge, To guide our feett into the waye of peace; To heare the virgines playing, ang'lls singinge The psalmes of glorie that shall never cease; To heare the sounde of suche an heavenly quere, Would it not joye the soule to se and heare? 83 To se the Saints and Martirs in ther places, By highest grace with heavenlye glorye crowned; To see the kisses and the sweett embraces, Of blessed soules by constant fayth renouned; To se the ground of all this sweett agreinge, Were not these sights all sweetlie worth the seinge? 84 The diamounde, rubie, saphire, and such like Of pretious gemmes, that are the worldlinge's joyes, And greatest princes for ther crownes doe seeke; To heavenlye treasures are but triflinge toyes: Wherwith the holie citie all is paved, And all the walles are round about engraved. 85 No! He that sits on the supernall throne, In majestie moste glorious to behould, And holdes the septer of the worlde alone; Hath not His garments of imbroydred goulde, But He is clothed with truth and righteousness; The garments of true fayth and holynes. 86 Oh, would my soule out of some angel's winge, By humble sute might gaine one heavenlye penne Might wright in honor of my glorious Kinge! The joye of angels, and the life of men; That all the worlde might fall upon ther faces To heare the glorie of his heavenlie graces. 87 But since I see his wondrous worth is suche, As doth exceed all reache of human sence; And all the earthe, unworthie is to touche, The smaleste title of his excellence; Lett me refere unto some angel's glorie, The hapie writtinge of this heavenlie storye. 88 Wher heavenlye love is cawse of holye life, And holie life encreaseth heavenlye love; Wher peace establisht without feare or stryfe, Doth prove the blissinge of the soule's behove; Wher thirst, nor hunger, grefe, nor sorrowe dwelleth, But peace in joye, and joye in peace excelleth. 89 Wher this sweett kinge that on the white horse rideth, Upon the winges of the celestiall winde; Neare whose sweett ayre no blastinge breath abideth, Nor stands the tree that he doth fruitles finde; Doth make all tremble wher his glorye goeth? Yea, wher his mildnes most his mercye sheweth? 90 O joyfull fear! on vertue's love all founded; O vertuous love! in mercie's glorie graced; O gratious love! on faythe in mercy grounded; O faythfull love! in heavenlye favoure placed; O setled love! that cannot be removed; O gratious love! of glorie so beloved. 91 Wher virgines joye in their virginitie; The virtuus spouses in undefiled bedd; The true divines in true divinytie; The gratious members in ther glorious heade; The synners joye for to escape damnation, And faythfull soules rejoyce in ther salvation. 92 Wher sicke men joye to se their sweetest health, The prisoned joye to see ther libertie; The pore rejoyce to se ther sweetest wealth, The verteous to adore the Deitye; And I unworthye most of all to see The eye of mercye cast one look on me. 93 But can my harte thus leave her holye love, Or cease to singe of this her highest sweett? Hath patience no more passiones for to prove? Hath fancye laboured out both hands and feett? Or hath invention strayned her vayne so sore, That witt nor will, hath power to write no more? 94 No! heavens forbid that ever faythfull harte, Should have a wearye thought of doinge well; But that the soule maye summon everye parte, Of everye sence wher anye thought maye dwell; That may discharge the dutie of this care, To pen his praise that is without compare. 95 But since no eye can looke on him and live, Nor harte can love, but lookinge on his love; Behould the glorye that his grace doth give, In all his workes that dothe His wonders prove; That all the world maye finde ther witts too weake But of the smalest of his prayse to speake. 96 Behould the earth how sweetlie she bringes forth Her trees, her flowers, her hearbes, and every grasse; Of sundrye nature and most secrett worth, And how ech branche doth others' beawtie passe; Both beastes, and birds, and fisshes, wormes and flies, How ech ther high Creator glorifies. 97 The lyon's strength doth make him stand as kinge, The unicorne doth kill the poyson's power; The roaring bull doth make the woods to ringe, The tiger doth the cruell wolfe devoure; The elephant the weightie burthen beares, And raveninge woulefes are good yett for ther heares. 98 To see the grayhounde course, the hounde in chase, Whilst litle dormouse sleepeth out her time; The lambes and rabbots sweetlie rune at base, Whilst highest trees the litle squiriles clime; The cralinge wormes out creepinge in the showers, And how the snayles do clime the lofty towers. 99 To see the whale make furrowes in the seas, Whilst soddenlye the dolphine strikes him deade; Which havinge founde the depth of his disease, Upon the shore doth make his dyinge bed; Where heavens doe worke for weaker harts' behove: Doth not this grace a worke of glorie prove? 100 But since that all skye, sea, or earth contaynes, Was made for man; and man was onlye made For onlye God, Who only glorie gaynes; And that one glorie that can never fade; Shall man forgett to give all glorie due Unto his God, from whom all glorie grew? 101 But lett me come a litle higher yett, To sune and Moone, and everye stare of light; To see how each doth in his order sitt, Wher everye one doth keep his course aright; And all to guide these darkned eyes of ours: Give these not glorie to the highest powers? 102 No, lett not man shew himself so ungratefull Unto his God, that all in love did make him; By thankles thoughts, to make his spirite hatefull Unto his kinge that never will forsake hime; But lett his soule to God all glorie give, In whome doth all love, life, and glorie live. 103 And lett me wretch, unworthy most of all, To lift myne eyes unto his lonelye seate; Before the feett, but of his mercye, falle, And of his mercye but the leave entreate; That with his servants I maye sitt and singe An alleluiah to my heavenlye kinge. 104 Come all the worlde and call your witts together, Borrowe some pens from out the angell's winges; Entreat the heavenes to send ther muses hether, To helpe your soules to write of sacred thinges; Prophane conceits must all be caste awaye; The night is past, and you must take the daye. 105 Speake not of synne, it hath no partie heare, But wright of grace, and whenc her glorye grew; Thinke of the love that to the life is deare, And of the life to whome all love is due; And then sitt downe in glorie all to singe, All to the glorye of your glorious kinge. 106 Firste make your grounde of faythfull holynes Then your devisions of divine desyres; Lett all your restes be hopes of happynes, Which mercye's musicke in the soule requires; Lett all your sharpes be feares of faythfull hartes, And all your flatts the death of your desarts. 107 Yett rise and fall, as hope or feare directes, The nature of ech note, in space, or line; And lett your voyces carrye such effectts, As maye approve your passions are divine; Then lett your consorts all agree in one, “To God above all glorye be alone.” 108 Then lett your dittie be the dearest thought, That may revive the dyinge harte of love; That onlye mercye in the soule hath wrought, The happie comforte of the heavens to prove; Then lett your sounds unto the heavens assend, And lett the closes all in glorie end. 109 Glorie to him that sitteth on the throne, With all the hoste of all the heavenes attended; Who all thinges made, and governes all alone, Vanquisht his foes, and all his flocke defended; And by his power his chosen soules preserveth, To singe his prayse that so alle prayse deserveth. 110 And whilst all soules are to his glorie singinge, Lett me pore wretch not whollye hould my peace; Butt let my teares from mercye's glorye springinge, Keepe time to that sweett songe maye never cease; That while my soule doth thus my God adore, I maye yett singe Amen, althoughe no more. Gloria in Excelsis Deo.</field>

Adue mine onely ioy whose absence breedes my smart, whose parting did amaze my minde &amp; damped much my hart. Adue mine onely loue, whose loue is life to me, whose loue once lost, no life can tast within my corps to be. Adue mine onely friend whose friendship cannot fade, whose faith is firme, vpon the which my health and hope is stayed, Adue the vitall spirits of these my sences all, for dead each parte will still remaine vntill I heare thee call. Farewell my selfe and all, farewell more deare then life: Farewel the constant dame on earth: farewel Vlisses wife. Sith Spite hath playde his parte, to parte vs now in twaine, my helpe shal rest in happy hope, till we two meet againe: Which hope doth heaue my heart aboue the hauty heauen, and carrieth me with good successe aboue the Plannets seouen, Sith that the Sunne must lodge within the Ocean seas, As oftime as the houres be within foure compleat dayes: So must Danaes face be rownd and horned thrise and for her light a debter be vnto Sir Phebus wise: Before I shal enioy the presence of my choyce, till which time comes, Ile cloy the skies with plaints &amp; bitter voyce. That Fortune now which frownes with all her fatal dames, shal haue for prayse most piteous plaints, and infamie for names: Vntil the time that she doth turne her face againe. and give me her that may redresse my ous pinching paine: God graunt that none beholde thy fa thy comely corps and feature Thy haires in tresses tyed thy Lilly with the Thy eyes with by dim Th The graces all attend the Muses make request, still for to waite vpon my deare, and be at her behest: Blush now you bashles dames that vaunt of beautie rare, for let me see who dares come in, and with my deare compare: No, no, you are all fled, you walke like owles by night, my deare so fayre, that of the world she is the onely wight: Then farewell heart and ioy, till time hath run her race, farewell delight, welcome annoy, till that I see thy face, Which wil delight my heart, which wil reuiue my minde which will delight my senceles corps, which ioy none else can finde, Take heere my speech last spent, vntill thy home returne, take here my heart, but leaue the corps which shal in torments burne. My scalding sighes Ile send throughout the skies to thee, my teares shall water still my couch, vntill thou beest with mee. Finis. A Louers Complaint. The restles race that I haue run, the peril and the paine That I from time to time haue past, and dayly doe sustaine, Doth make me dreme, that when I first this light began to see, The starrie skie no planet had, that happy was for me. The The chattering Pie, the Jay, and eke the Quaile, The Thrustle-Cock that was so blacke of hewe. All these did sing the prayse of her true heart, And mournd her death with dolefull musick sound: Each one digged earth, and plyed so their part, Till that she was close closed vnder ground. Finis. The counsell of a friend to one in loue. Clime not too high, for feare thou catch a fall, Seeke not to build thy nest within the Sunne, Refraine the thing which bringeth thee to thrall, Least when too late thou findste thy selfe vndone: Cause thy desires to rest and sleepe a space, And let thy fancie take her resting place. The Tiger fierce cannot by force be tamed, The eagle wilde will not be brought to fist, Nor womens mindes at any time be framed, To doe ought more than what their fancies list: Then cease thy pride, and let thy plumes downe fall, Least soaring still thou purchasts endles thrall. Finis. A Ladies complaint for the losse of her Loue. Come follow me you Nymphes, Whose eyes are neuer drie, Augment your wayling number nowe With me poore Emelie. Giue place ye to my plaintes, Whose ioyes are pincht with paine: My loue, alas through foule mishap, Most cruell death hath slaine. What wight can wel, alas, my sorrowes now indite? I waile &amp; want my new desire I lack my new delite. Gush out my trickling teares Like mighty floods of raine My Knight alas, through foule mishap Most cruell death hath slaine. Oh hap alas most hard, Oh death why didst thou so? Why could not I embrace my ioy, for me that bid such woe? False Fortune out, alas, Woe worth thy subtill traine, Whereby my loue through foule mishap, Most cruell death hath slaine. Rock me a sleepe in woe, You wofull Sisters three Oh cut you off my fatall threed, Dispatch poore Emelie. Why should I liue, alas, And linger thus in paine? Farewell my life, sith that my loue Most cruell death hath slaine. Finis. The lamentable complaint of a Louer. Accord your notes vnto my wofull songs, You chirping birds which hant the cloudy skie, Cease off your flight, and come to heare my wrongs Compeld by loue, mixed with crueltie: Leave off I say, and help me to lament My wofull dayes, vntill my time be spent. With sorrow great I passe away the time, The which too long I feele vnto my paine, Too childish is this fond conceit of mine, That voyde of hope doth helpelesse still remaine: Yet wil I rest til time doth further serue, That Atropos doth me of life bereaue. But fie fond foole, I complaine of disease, And faultlesse Fortune I begin to blame, Venus her selfe doth seeke me for to please, In causing me to loue so rare a dame: But if (faire Nimph) I might enioy thy sight, Thy fauour faire would force in me delight. But I am bannisht from thy comely hew, Oh thy sweet loue, but yet I wil remaine For euer thine as perfect louer true, Without all guile, although thou me disdaine: And thus I end, although not rest content, Vntil such time my wretched dayes are spent. Finis. A Poeme both pithie and pleasant. If right were rackt and ouer-runne, And power take parte with open wrong, If force by feare doe yeeld too soone, The lack is like to last too long: If God for goods shalbe vnplac'd, If right for riches leaues his shape, If world for wisdome be imbrac'd, The guesse is great much hurt may hap: Among good thinges I prooue and find, The quiet life doth most abound, And sure to the contented mind, There is no riches may be found: Riches doth hate to be content, Rule is enmie to quiet ease, Power for the most part is vnpacient And seldome likes to liue in peace: I heard a Shepheard once compare, That quiet nights he had more sleepe, And had more merrie dayes to spare Then he which ought his Flock of sheepe. I would not haue it thought heereby, The Dolphin swim I meane to teach, Ne yet to learne the Faulcon flie, I roue not so farre past my reach, But as my part aboue the rest, Is wel to wish and good to will: So till the breath doth fayle my brest, I shal not stay to wish you still. A Poeme. The time was once that I haue liued free, And wandred heere, and where me liketh best, But in my wandring I did chance to see A Damsel faire which caus'd in me small rest: For at her sight mine heart was wounded sore, That liued free and voyd of loue before. Which when I felt, I got me to my bed, Thinking to rest my heauie heart: but then There came strange thoughts into my troubled hed, Which made me thinke vpon my thoughts agen: And thus in thinking on my thoughts did sleep, And dreamed that another did her keepe. With this same dreame I sudainly awoke, And orderly did marke it euery poynt: And with the same so great a griefe I tooke, That as one scard, I quaked euery ioynt: Yet at the last supposd it but a dreame, My troubled spirits did reuiue againe. Finis. Fantasma. In fortune as I lay, my fortune was to finde Such fancies as my carefull thought, had brought into my minde, And when each one was gone to rest, full soft in bed to lie, I would haue slept, but then the watch did follow still mine eye: And sodainly I saw a sea of sorrowes prest, Whose wicked waues of sharpe repulse brought me vnquiet rest. I saw this world, and how it went, each state in his degree, And that from wealth graunted is both life and libertie: I saw how enuie it did raigne, and bare the greatest price, Yet greater poyson is not found within the Cockatrice: I also saw how that disdaine, oft times to forge my woe, Gaue me the cup of bitter sweete, to pledge my mortall foe: I also saw how that deceit, to rest no place could finde, But still constraind an endles paine, to follow natures kinde. I also saw most strange, how Nature did forsake the blood that in her womb was wrought, as doth the loathed snake, I saw how fancie would remaine, no longer then her lust, And as the winde how she doth change, and is not for to trust: I saw how stedfastnes did flie, with winges of often change, A bird, but truely seldome seene, her nature is so strange: I saw how pleasant Time did passe, as Flowers in the Mead, To day that riseth red as Rose, tomorrow lyeth dead. I saw my time how it did run, as sand out of the Glasse, Euen as each hower appoynted is, from tide to tide to passe: I saw the yeares that I had spent, and losse of all my gaine, And how the sport of youthfull playes, my folly did retaine: I saw how that the little Ant in Summer still doth runne To seeke her foode, whereby to liue in winter for to come: I saw eke vertue, how she sate the threed of life to spinne, Which sheweth the end of euery thing before it doeth begin. And when al these I saw, with many moe perdie, In me my thoughts each one had wrought a perfect propertie: And then I sayd vnto my selfe, a Lesson this shalbe, For other that shal after come, for to beware by me. Thus all the night I did deuise which way I might constraine, To forme a plot that wit might worke the branches in my braine. Finis. The complaint of one being in love. Leaue me O life, the prison of my minde, Since nought but death can take away my lotte, For she which likes me wel is most vnkinde, And that which I loue best my death doth prooue. Loue in her eyes my hopes againe reuiue, Hopes in my thoughts doe kindle my desires, Desire inflam'd through loue and beauty striue, Til she (displeased with loue) my death conspires: That loue for me, and I for Loue doe cal, Yet she denies because she graunts not al. Finis. A Louers resolution. True, though vntried, desirous in despaire, Patient with paine, faithful though yet not sound, In cares vnknowne my youthful daies I weare, More sure then safe my youth and beauty bound. What shal I say? the time serues not to waile: Let it suffice, my faith shal neuer faile. Finis. A Louers complaint. The fire to see my wrongs for anger burneth, The aire in raine for mine affection weepeth, The sea to ebbe for griefe his flowing turneth The earth with pittie dul the centre keepeth, Fame is with wonder blazed, Time runnes away for sorrow, Place standeth still amazed, To see my nights of euill which haue no morrow. Alas, onely she no pitty taketh To see my miseries, but chast and cruel, My fall her glorie maketh Yet still her eyes giues to my flames their fuel. Fire burne me quick, till sence of burning leaue, Ayre let me drawe my breath no more in anguish, Sea drowne me in thee, of teadious life bereaue me, Earth take this earth, wherein these spirits languish: Fame same I was not borne, Time draw my dismall hower, Place see my graue vp-torne, Fire, Aire, sea, earth, Fame, time, place, shew your power: Alas, from all their helps I am exiled, For hers am I, and death feares her displeasure: Oh death thou art beguiled, Though I be hers she makes of me no treasure. Finis. A sweet lullabie. Come little babe, come silly soule, Thy fathers shame, thy mothers griefe, Borne as I doubt to all our dole, And to thy selfe vnhappie chiefe: Sing Lullabie and lap it warme, Poore soule that thinkes no creature harme. Thou little thinkst and lesse doost knowe, The cause of this thy mothers moane, Thou wantst the wit to waile her woe, And I my selfe am all alone: Why doost thou weepe? why doost thou waile? And knowest not yet what thou doost ayle. Come little wretch, ah silly heart, Mine onely ioy what can I more: If there be any wrong thy smart, That may the destinies implore: Twas I, I say, against my will, I wayle the time, but be thou still. And doest thou smile, oh thy sweete face, Would God himselfe he might thee see, No doubt thou wouldst soone purchace grace. I know right well for thee and mee: But come to mother babe and play, For father false is fled away. Sweet boy if it by fortune chance, Thy father home againe to send, If death do strike me with his launce, Yet mayst thou me to him c?mend: If any aske thy mothers name, Tell how by loue she purchast blame. Then will his gentle heart soone yeeld, I know him of a noble minde, Although a Lyon in the field, A Lamb in towne thou shalt him finde: Aske blessing babe, be not afrayde, His sugred words hath me betrayde. Then mayst thou ioy and be right glad, Although in woe I seeme to moane, Thy father is no Rascall lad, A noble youth of blood and boane: His glancing lookes if he once smile, Right honest women may beguile. Come little boy and rocke a sleepe, Sing lullabie and be thou still, I that can doe nought else but weepe, Wil sit by thee and waile my fill: God blesse my babe and lullabie, From this thy fathers qualitie.

Finis. A prettie Poeme. A Trembling hand, but not a traitor's heart Writing for feare and fearing for to write, Loath to reueale, yet willing to impart, Such secret thoughts as fit not euery sight Must leaue to you in sweet conceit to know them, For I haue sworne that I will neuer shew them. I know not what, but sure the griefe is greene, I know not when, but once it was not euer, I know not how, but secretly vnseene, And make no care if it be ended neuer, And yet a wound that wastes me all with woe, And yet would not that it were not so: But oh sweete God, what doe these humors moue? Alas, I feare, God shield it be not loue. Finis. A Louer in despaire. Bvrne burne, desire, while thy poore fuel lasteth, Young wood enflam'd doth yeeld the brauest fire, Though long before in smothering heat it wasteth With froward will to conquer his desire: But fire supprest once breaking into flame, Doth rage till all be wasted in the same. Most tyrannous and cruel element, So to Enuie the Substance of thy life, As to consume thy vital nourishment, Till death it selfe doe end this mortal strife: Yet worke thy wil on me O raging fire, And leaue no coales to kindle new desire. Ne let the glowing heat of ashes left, Yeeld to my fainting sences fresh reliefe, But as my soule from comfort thou hast reft, So end my life in this consuming griefe: For wel I see, nor wit nor wil now serueth, To recompence desire as he deserueth. Finis. A Dreame of the arraignement of Desire. A court was lately kept in secret of conceit, To cal desire vnto his death, or cleare him of deceit, Fayre Beautie was the Queene, and loue was all her Lawes, Who had appoynted perfect sence to sit vpon the cause. The wretches that accus'd desire of ill desart, Where Enuie, packt with Iniurie, to kil a careful heart, The whole Inditement read against desire, was this, That where he most auowed best he ment not least amis, The Lawyers that did plead against this poore desire, Where wicked wit with eloquence, whom hate and wrong did hire. But to defend desire was plaine simplicitie, Who knew the bounds and kept the bonds of perfect amitie: A grand Inquest in haste was panneld by the Court. Of whom Tom-troth was foreman made, and so begun the sport. Suspect did halfe affirme, that witnes should not neede, And yet selfe-will would faine haue sworne that a was true indeed. But reason wild regard, the treason should be tryed, And deepe conceit should be the man that should the trueth decide. Suspect in Natures sence layd shrewdly to his charge, But care had brideled Natures course, loue neuer liu'd at large, And conscience plaine replyed in reasons secrete thought, That good wines need no Iuie-bush, and eloquence is naught. To sound the depth of all did sences all assemble, And poore goodwill came swearing in, that loue could not dissemble, When patience fully heard the pleading of the case, She call'd to reason to reueale who had deserud disgrace, Good-wil was earnest still, and sware that liue or die, Suspect did sore abuse desire, for louers could not lie. With that the people laught, and reason chargd Tomtroth To giue vp vnto perfect sence the verdict of his oath. The Iurors were the thoughts that did posse the minde, Where flatterie was but fancies foole while faith did fauour finde. Who when they had at ful considered of the cause, Gaue Enuie vp for enimie to loue and al his lawes. And wit was but a foole to follow false suspect, And eloquence was little worth to carrie such effect. And hate and enuie both were had in great disgrace, And eloquence for taking parte, was hissèd out of place. And sweet desire was cleare, in Reasons secret sence, And perfect sence gaue iudgement so, and quit him of offence. And beautie that before was thought did quite disdaine him, Did graunt him fauour by desert, and loue did entertaine him. Suspect to silence put, good Nature gan to smile, To heare them iudge to loues disdaine that would desire beguile. And sweet desire the force of enuies ouerthrow, And therewithal the Court brake vp, and I awakèd so. Finis. Brittons Diuinitie. From worldly cares and wanton loues conceit, Begun in griefe and ended in deceit: I am coniur'd by hope of happie blis, Where heauenly faith and highest fauour is, To call my wits and all my thoughts together, To write of heauen, and of the high-way thither. The holy spirit of eternall power, Vouchsafe his grace to guide my soule aright, That patient heart may finde the happie hower, When I may see the glorie of that sight, That in conceit so fully may content me, As nought on earth be able to torment me. I aske no ayde of any earthly muse, Far be my fancie from such fonde affect: But in the heauen where highest Angels vse, To sing the sweet of faithful loues effect, Among those spirits of especiall grace, I wish my soule might haue a sitting-place. Where first the teares of true repentant hart, With faithful hope may happy fauor moue, And sighing sobs of sorrowes bitter smart, May see the life of vndeseruèd loue: Thence would I craue some excellence deuine, To set my foote in this discourse of mine. To iudge of heauen it is a place of ioy, Where happy soules haue their eternall rest, Where sweet delights doe suffer no annoy, But all things good and onely on the best. Where comforts moer then man can comprehend, And such contents as neuer can haue end. It is the Throne of high Jehouah sweete, The God of power, of glorie and of grace, Where vertue dwels, and her adherents meete, In ioyful feare to see his heauenly face, Where holy saints and highest Angels sing, An Alleluia to their heauenly King. There is the day, and there is neuer night, There euer ioy, and there is neuer sorrow, There neuer wrong, but there is euer right, There euer haue, and neuer need to borrow, There euer loue, and there is neuer hate, Neuer but there was euer such a state. There all the graces doe agree in one, There liueth brethren in one linke of loue, There all the saints doe serue one King alone, Who giues the blis of highest hearts behoue. There is the place of perfect paradice, Where conscience liues and comfort neuer dies. There is the Sun, the beautie of the skie, The Moone and Starres, the candles of the night, There is the essence of that heauenly eye, That blinds the proud and giues the humble light, There is the rainebow bended by his hand, Who doth both heauen, earth, sea, and hel c?mand. There sitteth God in glorie of this throne, With Virgins, saints and Angels all attended, Who in his Ire hath Kingdomes ouerthrowen, And in his loue hath little things defended, Whose glorie more then may by man be knowen, And glorie most is in his mercy showen. There doth he sit in highest of his power, Calling the poore vnto his rich reliefe, Sowing the sweete that killeth euerie sower, Giuing the salue that healeth euery griefe: Making them liue that long were dead before, And liuing so, that they can die no more. By him alone the dumbe doe speake againe, Of him alone the blinde receiue their seeing, With him alone is pleasure without pain In him alone haue blessèd hearts their beeing: To him alone and onely but vnto him, All glorie due that al the world may doe him. Now haue I writ, though far beneath the worth, Of highest Heauen, what happie hart conceiueth Nor wil I trie in order to set forth, Direction such as neuer hope deceiueth, How care may climbe the hill of happines Where is the heauen of highest blessednesse. Grace is the ground of euery good that is, The ground once good, how can the work be ill? Then that the mind may not be lead amisse, Beseech the helpe of his most blessèd will: Whose onely word sets downe the passage best Of humble soules to their desirèd rest. Begin to leaue, and make an end to loue, Such wanton thoughts as wofull sorrow giue, Be once resolu'd and neuer doe remoue, To live to die, as thou mayst die to liue: Which hell to hate, aud seeke for heauenly blis Read of the world, and tell me what it is. The world (in trueth) is but a wofull vale, Where griefe for grasse, and sinnes doe grow for seed, Where substance, sence and soules are set to sale, While hoorders heape that naked people need: And for the gaine but of a simple groat, One man wil seeke to cut anothers throate. What is there here that can content the hart? That knowes content or what it doth containe: What thought so sweet but brings as sower a smart? What pleasure such but breeds a greater paine? What thing so good but prooues in fine so euill? As (but for God) would beare men to the deuill. What is the earth? the labour of the life. What is the sea? a gulfe of grislie lakes, What is the ayre? a stuffe of filthie strife: What is the fire? the spoyle of that it takes. Since these are al whence euerie thing doth spring What is the world, but euen a woful thing? What thing is man? a clod of mirie clay, Slime of the earth, a slaue to filthie sinne, Springs like a weed, and so doth weare away, Goes to the earth where first he did begin: Thinke with thy selfe, when thou thy selfe art such What is in Man that man should be so much: What hath the world to leade thy minde to loue? In true effect, a fardle full of toyes, For wey the pith what euerie man doth prooue, The perfect Gems are most vnperfect ioyes; Consider all what fancie bringeth forth, The best conceit will fall out nothing worth. What worldlie thinges doe follow fancie most? Wealth, beautie, loue, fine diet, honour, fame: What finds affect? both loue and labour lost, Disdaine, disease, dishonour, death and shame. Where care and sorrow, death and deadlie strife, Doo rule the roste in this accursed life. What thing is beautie? a colour quicklie gone. And what is wealth when riches fall to rust? What thing is loue? a toy to think vpon: Fine diet? drosse to feede a filthie lust. What worldlie honor? oft unworthie praise: What ease? the cause whereby the life decayes? What is disdaine? the scorne of proud conceit, And what disease? the death of discontent: Dishonor next? the fruit of fond deceit, And what is death? the end of ill intent. Now what is shame? a shamefull thing to tel: What is the world but wickeds way to hel? For beaste, for birds, for fishes, flowers and trees, And all such thinges created for our vse, What thing is man to take such things as these, By want of grace to turne into abuse? Oh wretched world, when man that shuld be best, In beastly things prooues worse then all the rest. Thus have I shew'd the world and what it is, A wicked place and ful of wretched woes, A sincke of sinne shut out from heauenly blis, Where lacke of grace doth wit and reason loose: So vile a thing as who in kinde doth prooue it, Will soone confesse he hath no cause to loue it. Now how to leaue this loathsome life of ours, The hatefull hel the ground of euerie griefe, Implore the helpe of those assurèd powers, Who neuer faile the faithfull soule reliefe: Laye by these thoughts that are to be abhord, And sett thy heart vpon thy heauenlie Lord. First knowe thy God, and what a God he is, Without beginning and can haue no end, Who in His loue created onely his, And by his hand doth euer his defend: Whose glorious essence of his excellence, Makes highest powers to tremble at his presence. He made the world and what it doth containe, Onely but man he made vnto his loue, And mans good-will was his desirèd gaine, Till proud attempt did high displeasure mooue: He plagu'd his pride, yet when he saw his paine, He gaue the salue that heald the wound againe. He gaue the rules to guide the soule aright, What it should doe, and what it should not doe, He shew'd the summe of his desires delight, And what the heart should set it selfe vntoo: And in the good of his most gracious will, He shew'd the good that healèd euerie ill. He gaue the sunne, the moone and starres a course, That they obserue according to his will: He makes the tides to take their due recourse, And sets the earth where it doth settle still: He made the substance of each element, And sets his foot vpon the firmament. He giues vs knowledge and we will not know him He bids vs aske, and we wil neuer mooue him: He bids vs come, and we are running from him: He giues vs life, and yet we neuer loue him: He is our King, and we doe not respect him, He is our God, and yet we doe neglect him. And nought but man that can or dare deuise, How to offend that holy wil of his, In onely man that cursèd humor lyes, That makes no care to run his course amis, But day by day doth more and more offend him Whose onely hand doth from all hurt defend him. Vngrateful man whom God did onely make, In loue to loue, and with his loue preserueth, And for his loue endurèd for his sake Such death of life as dearest loue deserueth: What cursèd hart would in displeasure mooue him That giuing all, askes nothing but to loue him. Oh loue, sweet loue, oh high and heauenly loue, The onely loue that leads to happie life, Oh loue that liues for lovinge hearts behoue, And makes an end of euery hateful strife: How happie he that kindly can attaine it, And how accurst that dare for to disdaine it. Loue was the cause that first we were created, Loue is the life that we haue giuen to lead, Loue is the cause we neuer can be hated, Loue is our life when other life is dead, Loue is the grace that highest good doth giue, Learne but to loue, and t'is enough to liue. First loue thy God that taught thee how to loue, Then loue the loue that he in loue hath taught thee. That loue so fixed as nothing can remoue, The hope of life that highest loue hath wroght thee. Thus if thou loue, thy loue will be a friend, To gaine the life where loue wil neuer end. Finis. A Louers complaint. O loue, alas, what may I call thy loue, Thy vncouth loue, thy passions wondrous strange mischiefe deadly such as for to prooue, rt would shun if power I had to change. ge said I: recant againe that sound, must, recant it shall indeede. She sware, as she a woman was, no loue she did allow, Alas, then grew my paine, it greu'd me to the heart, My sences then so sencelesse were, as that I felt no smart, And standing in a maz, as Aspis on the charme, She said and swore (to saue my life) she wisht no good nor harme. Alas, what bitter sweet, alas what pleasant paine, What shiuering heat, what chilling cold, did passe through euery vaine? And when I would haue sworne her heart would neuer mooue, By Jesus Christ she tooke that oath, that she did neuer loue. Alas what was I then? alas what am I now? Too weake to loue, too strong to die, quick, dead, I know not how? Finis. A Poeme. Weare happie I as others are, Then might I liue as others doe: But fortune giues a sundrie share, And more to one then others too, The mind doth yet content it selfe, What euer fortune doe befall, And makes no count of cankred pelfe, Nor cares for any care at all. For health it is the gift of God, And giue him thankts, and so haue done, And want of wealth a heauenly rod, To punish natures eldest sonne. If freinds doe frowne, then farewel they, This worldlie loue wil neuer last, And if it be a rainie day, The sunne wil shine when storme is past. If troubles come a thwart thy minde, Why tis a rule, there is no rest, And he that seekes and cannot finde, Must take a little for a feast. If Ladies loue, they laugh for ioy, And if they doe not, farewell loue: If thou be lost, tis but a toy, And if it hold, it will not mooue. Faire beautie soone will fade away, And riches quicklie fall to rust, Thy youthfull yeares will soone decay, And age will soone giue ouer lust. The greatest horse is but a beast, The highest Hawk is but a bird, The sweetest banquet but a feast, The brauest man is but his word. To promise much doth please the eare, But to performe contents the heart, And where performance commeth, there A vowèd loue can neuer parte. But they that haue the world at will And shrinketh at a shower of raine, May hap to wish and want there will, Vnles their hands haue greater gaine. But hap what will my heart is sette, I am resolu'd of this conceit, If by desert I cannot get, I loath to liue vpon deceit. For stayèd minde is of that state, As euerie fortune cannot finde, hope nor feare, nor loue, nor hate, Can euer change an honest minde. her die in secrete griefe, ete care can euer be conceald, Of his Mistresse loue. To trie whose art and strength did most excell, My Mistresse, Loue and faire Diana met, The Ladies three foorthwith to shooting fell, And for the prize the richest Jewel set. Sweet Loue did both her bowe and arrowes gage, Diana did her beautie rare lay downe, My Mistresse pawnde her crueltie and rage, And she that wanne had all for her renowne: It fell out thus when as the match was done, My Mistresse gat the beautie and the bowe, And streight to trie the weapons she had wonne, Vpon me heart she did a shaft bestow. By beautie bound, by Loue and Vigor slaine, The losse is mine where hers was all the gaine. Of a discontented minde. Poets come all, and each one take a penne, Let all the heads that euer did indite, Let Sorrow rise out of her darkest denne, And helpe an heart an heauie tale to write. And if all these or any one can touch, The smallest part of my tormenting paine: Then will I thinke my griefe is not so much, But that in time it may be healde againe. But if no one come neere the thought, Of that I feele, and no man els can finde, Then let him say that deare his cunning bought, There is no death to discontented minde. Of his Mistresse Beautie. What ailes mine eies, or are my wits distraught, Doe I not see, or know not what I see: No marueil though I see that wonder wrought, That on the earth another cannot bee. What ment the Gods when first they did creat you, To make a face to mocke all other features, Angels in heauen will surelie deadlie hate you, To leaue the world so full of foolish creatures: Cheekes that enchaine the highest hearts in thrall, Is it set downe such faire shall neuer fail you. Hands, that the hearts of highest thoughts appall, Was not Minerua made when she had made you: Faire: looke on you, and farewell beauties grace, Wise: why your wits the wisest doth abash. Sweet: where is sweet, but in your sweetest face, Rich: to your will all treasure is but trash. Oh how these hands are catching at those eyes, To feed this heart that onely liues vpon them, Ah, of these hands what humors doe arise, To blind these eyes that liue by looking on them. But hearts must faint that must be going from you, And eyes must weepe that in you loose their seeing, Heauens be your place, where Angels better know you, And earth is too base for such a Goddesse-beeing. Yet where you come among those highest powers, Craue pardon then for all these great offences, That when you dwelt among these hearts of ours, Your onelie eyes did blind our wits and sences. Now if you see my will aboue my wit, Thinke of the good that all your graces yeeld you: A mazèd Muse must haue a madding fit, Who is but mad that euer hath beheld you. A Sonnet. Those eyes that hold the hand of euerie heart, That hand that holds the heart of euerie eye, That wit that goes beyond all Natures art, The sence too deepe for wisdome to discrie. That eye, that hand, that wit, that heauenlie sence, Doth shew my onely Mistresse excellence. Oh eyes that pearce into the purest heart, Oh hands that hold the highest thoughts in thrall, Oh wit that weyes the depth of all desart, Oh sence that shewe the secret sweet of all. The heauen of heauens with heauenlie power preserue thee, Loue but thy selfe, and giue me leaue to serue thee. To serue, to liue to looke vpon those eyes, To looke, to liue to kisse that heauenly hand, To sound that wit that doth amaze the minde, To know that sence, no sence can vnderstand, To vnderstand that all the world may know, Such wit, such sence, eyes, hands, there are no moe. A pastorell of Phillis and Coridon. On a hill there growes a flower, Faire befall the daintie sweet: By that flower there is a bower, Where the heauenly Muses meete. In that bower there is a chaire, Fringèd all about with golde: Where doth sit the fairest faire, That did euer eye beholde. It is Phillis faire and bright, She that is the shepheards ioy: She that Venus did dispight, And did blind her little boy. This is she the wise, the rich, And the world desires to see, This is Ipsa quæ the which, There is none but onely shee. Who would not this face admire, Who would not this Saint adore, Who would not this sight desire, Though he thought to see no more: Oh faire eyes yet let me see, One good looke, and I am gone. Looke on me for I am hee, Thy poore sillie Corridon. Thou that art the shepheards Queene, Looke vpon thy silly swaine: By thy comfort haue beene seene, Dead men brought to life againe. The complaint of a forsaken Louer. Let me goe seeke some solitarie place, In craggie rocks where comfort is vnknowne: Where I may sit and waile my heauie case, And make the heauens acquainted with my mone, Where onêlie Eccho with her hallow voyce, May sound the sorrow of my hidden sence: And cruel chance the crosse of sweetest choyse, Doth breed the paine of this experience. In mourning thoughts let me my minde attire, And clad my care in weedes of deadlie woe: And make disgrace the graue of my desire, Which tooke his death whereby his life did growe: And ere I die engraue vpon my tombe, Take heede of Loue, for this is Louers doome. A pretie fancie. Who takes a friend and trusts him not, Who hopes of good and hath it not. Who hath a Item and keepes it not, Who keepes a Ioy and loues it not. The first wants wit, the second will, Carelesse the third, the fourth doth ill. An epitaph on the death of a noble Gentleman. Sorrow come sit thee downe, and sigh and sob thy fill, And let these bleeding bitter teares, be witnesse of thine ill, See, see, how Vertue sits, what passions she doth prooue, To thinke vpon the losse of him, that was her dearest loue. Come Pallas carefull Queene, let all thy Muses waite, About the graue, where buried is, the grace of your conceit. Poets lay downe your pennes, or if you needs will write, Confesse the onely day of loue hath lost her dawning light. And you that know the Court, and what beseemes the place, With griefe engraue vp? his tombe, he gaue al Courts a grace. And you that keepe the fields, and know what valure is, Say all too soone was seene in this vntimelie death of his. Oh that he liu'd in earth, that could but halfe conceiue, The honour that his rarest heart was worthie to receiue, Whose wisdome farre aboue the rule of Natures reach, Whose workes are extant to the world, that al the world may teach, Whose wit the wonder-stone, that did true wisdome tuch, And such a sounder of conceipt, as few or neuer such. Whose vertue did exceed in Natures highest vaine. Whose life a lanthorne of the loue that surelie liues againe. Whose friendship faith so fast, as nothing could remooue him, Whose honourable curtesie made all the world to loue him: What Language but he spake: what rule but he had read? What thought so high? what sence so deep but he had in his head: A Phœnix of the world, whom fame doth thus commend, Vertue his life, Valor his loue, and Honour was his end. Vpon whose tombe be writ, that may with teares be red: Heere lies the flower of chiualrie that euer England bred. Oh heauens, vpon the earth was neuer such a day, That all conceits of all contents should al consume away, Me thinkes I see a Queene come couered with a vaile, The Court al stricken in a dumpe, the Ladies weepe &amp; waile, The Knights in careful sighes bewaile their secret losse, And he that best c?ceales his griefe, bewraies he hath a crosse. Come Scholers bring your bookes, let reason haue his right, Doe reuerence vnto the corse, in honour of the Knight, Come souldiers see the Knight, that left his life so neere ye, Giue him a volley of your harts, that al the world may heare ye. And ye that liue at home, and passe your time in peace, To helpe ye sing his dolefull dirge, let sorrow neuer cease. Oh could I mourne enough, that all the world may see, The griefe of loue for such a losse, as greater cannot bee. Our Court hath lost a friend, our Countrie such a Knight, As with the torment of the thought, hath turnèd day to night: A man, so rare a man, did neuer England breed, So excellent in euerie thing, that all men did exceed. So full of all effects, that wit and sence may scan, As in his heart did want no part to make a perfect man. Perfection farre aboue the rule of humaine sence, Whose heart was onely set on heauen, and had his honor thence, Whose marke of hiest aime, was honor of the minde, Who both at once did worldlie fame, and heauenlie fauour find: Whom Vertue so did loue, and Learning so adore, As commendations of a man, was neuer man had more: Whom wise men did admire, whom good men did affect, Whom honest men did loue and serue, and all men did respect. Whose care his Countries loue, whose loue his Countries care, Whose careful loue considered wel, his Countrie could not spare. Oh Christ what ruthfull cries about the world doe ring, And to behold the heauie sighs it is a hellish thing. The campe, the dolefull campe, comes home with all a Mort, To see the Captaine of their care, come home in such a sort. The Court, the solemne court, is in a sudden trance, And what is he but is amazde to heare of this mischance. The Cittie shakes the head, as it had lost a piller, And kind Affect is in such care, a little more would kill her: Sweet Oxford sits and weepes, and Cambridge cries outright, To loose the honour of their loue, and loue of their delight. The Cleargie singing Psalmes, with teares beblot their bookes, And all the Schollers follow on, with sad and heauie lookes. The Muses and the Nimphes attirèd all in blacke, With tearing heares, &amp; wringing hands, as if their hearts would cracke: The father, wife, and friends, and seruants in degrees, With blubbred eyes bewaile the life that faithfull loue did leese. My self that lou'd him more then he that knew him much, Wil leaue the honour of his worth, for better wits to tutch: And saie but what I thinke, and that a number know, He was a Phœnix of a man, I feare there are no moe: To set him downe in praise with men of passèd fame, Let this suffice who more deseru'd: I neuer read his name. For this he was in right, in briefe to shew his praise, For Vertue, Learning, Valor, Wit, the honour of our dayes. And so with honor ende, let all the world goe seeke, So young a man, so rare a man, the world hath not the like. Whose onelie corps consumes, whose Vertue neuer dies, Whose sweetest soule enioyes the sweet of highest Paradice. The sum of the former in foure lines. Grace, Vertue, Valor, Wit, Experience, Learning, Loue, Art, Reason, Time, Conceite, Deuise, Discretion, Trueth, All these in one, and but one onely prooue, Sorrow in age, to see the end of youth. In the praise of his Mistresse. Poets lay downe your pennes, let fancie leaue to faine, Bid al the Muses goe to bed, or get a better vaine. There musicks are to base, to sound that sweet consaite, That on the wonder of the world, with wonder may awaite: But if as yet vnknowne, there be some daintie Muse, That can doe more then al the rest, and will her cunning vse, Let her come whet her wits, to see what she can doe, To that the best that euer wrote, came neuer neere vntoo, For Venus was a toy, and onely feignèd fable, And Cresed but a Chawcers ieast, and Helen but a bable. My tale shalbe of trueth, that neuer treason taught, My Mistresse is the onelie sweet, that euer Nature wrought, Whose eyes are like those starres that keepe the highest skies, Whose beautie like the burning Sunne, that blinds the clearest eies, Whose haires are like those beames that hang about the Sunne, When in the morning furthe he stepps before his course to runne: And let me touch those lips, by loue, by leaue, or lucke, When sweet affect, by sweet aspect, may yet some fauour sucke. They are those little foldes, of Natures finest wit, That she sat smoothing while she wrought &amp; wilbe smacking yet: And for that purest red, with that most perfect white, That makes those cheeks the sweetest chains, of louers high delite, What may be said but this? Behold the onely feature, That al the world that sees the face, may w?der at the creature. I wil not stand to muse as many writers doe, To seeke out Natures fittest stuffe to like her lims vntoo, For if there were on earth that could in part compare: With anie part of anie part, wherein her praises are: Either for Natures gifts, or Vertues sweetest grace: I would confesse a blinded heart, were in vnhappie case. But where both Nature, Sence, and Reason doth approue, She is the onely saint on earth, whom God and man doth loue. Let this in summe suffice for my poore Muse and mee. She is the Goddesse of the earth, and there is none but she. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PASQVILS Mad-cappe, Throwne at the Corrvptions of these Times. WITH His MESSAGE to Men of all Estates Tempore Patet Occvlta Veritas. An Inuectiue against the Wicked of the Worlde. Why should man loue this wretched world so much, In which is nothing, but all worse then nought? Shadowes and shewes of things are nothing such, While strong illusions haue too weake a thought, With wicked humors too much ouer-wrought, The witch of Will and ouerthrow of Wit, Where gracelesse sinnes doe in their glory sit. Beauty is but a babie's looking-glasse, While Money eates into the Miser's heart, And guarded Pride, all like a Golden Asse, Makes Lechery lay open euery part. Sloath lies and sleepes, and feares no waking smart, While froth and fatte in drunken gluttony The venome shew of Nature's villany. Patience is counted but a poet's fancie, While Wrath keepes reakes in euery wicked place, And fretting Enuy falne into a franzie, While tyrant Murther treades a bloody trace, And blessed Pitty dare not shew her face: Pride, power and pence march in such battle ray, As beares downe all that comes within their way. The wealthy Rascall be he ne're so base, Filthy, ill-fauor'd, vgly to behold, Moale-eie, plaise-mouth, dogges-tooth, and camel's face, Blinde, dumbe, and deafe, diseasèd, rotten, olde, Yet, if he haue the coffers full of golde, He shall haue reuerence, curtsie, cappe and knee, And worship, like a man of high degree. He shall haue Ballads written in his praise, Bookes dedicated to his patronage, Wittes working for his pleasure many waies, Petigrees sought to mend his parentage, And linkt perhaps in Noble marriage, He shall haue all that this vile worlde can giue him, That into pride, the deuill's mouth may driue him. If he can speake, his wordes are Oracles, If he can see, his eyes are spectacles, If he can heare, his eares are miracles, If he can stand, his legges are pinacles: Thus in the rules of Reason's obstacles, If he be but a beast in shape and nature, Yet, giue him wealth, he is a goodly creature. But, be a man of ne're so good a minde, As fine a shape as Nature can deuise; Vertuous and gratious, comely, wise, and kinde, Valiant, well giuen, full of good qualities, And almost free from Fancie's vanities: Yet let him want this filthy worldly drosse, He shall be sent but to the Beggars Crosse. The foole will scoffe him, and the knaue abuse him, And euery rascall in his kinde disgrace him, Acquaintance leaue him, and his friends refuse him: And euery dogge will from his doore displace him. Oh this vile world will seeke so to deface him That vntill death doe come for to releeue him, He shall haue nothing heere but that may greeue him. If he haue pence to purchase pretty things, She that doth loue him will dissemble loue; While the poore man his heart with sorrow wrings To see how want doth womens loue remooue, And make a iack-dawe of a turtle-doue: If he be rich, worldes serue him for his pelfe, If he be poore, he may goe serue himselfe. If he be rich, although his nose doe runne, His lippes doe slauer, and his breath doe stinke, He shall haue napkins faire and finely spunne, Pilles for the rhewme, and such perfumèd drinke As were he blinde, he shall not seeme to winke: Yea, let him cough, halke, spit, fart and pisse, If he be wealthy, nothing is amisse. But with his pence, if he haue got him power, Then halfe a god, that is more halfe a diuell; Then Pride must teach him how to looke as sower, As beldam's milke that turnèd with her sneuill; While the poore man that little thinketh euill, Though Nobly borne, shall feare the Beggar's frowne, And creepe and crowch vnto a filthy clowne. Oh, he that wants this wicked cankred coyne, May fret to death before he finde reliefe, But if he haue the cunning to purloyne And ease the begger of his biting griefe, Although (perhaps) he play the priuie thiefe: It is no matter if the bagges be full, Well fare the wit that makes the world a Gull. The Chuffe that sits and champes vpon his chaffe, May haue his mawkin kisse him like a mare; And on his barne-doore-threshold lye and laugh, To see the swagg'rer with the beggars share, Follow the hounds, till he hath caught the hare: Oh tis the purse that guildes the bullocke's horne, And makes the shrew to laugh the sheepe to scorne. Who hath not seene a logger-headed Asse, That hath no more wit than an old ioynd-stoole, Prinking himselfe before a looking-glasse, And set a face as though he were no foole, When he that well might set the calfe to schoole, Must be attentiue to the gander's keake, Or giue a plaudite, when the goose doth speake. Let but a dunce, a dizard, or a dolt Get him a welted gowne, a sattin coate; Then though at randon he doe shoote his bolt, By telling of an idle tale by roate, Where Wisedome findes not one good word to note: Yea though he can but gruntle like a swine Yet to the eight wise men he shall be nine. But for a poore man, be he nere so wise, Grounded in rules of Wit and Reason's grace, And in his speeches neuer so precise, To put no word out of Discretion's place; Yet shall you see, in shutting vp the case, A pesant slouen with the purse's sleight, Will humme and haw him quite out of conceit. Looke on a souldier that hath brauely serude And with discretion can direct a campe; If he haue nothing for himselfe reserude, To warme his ioynts when he hath got the crampe; He shall haue little oyle vnto his lampe, But in a iacket and a paire of broages Goe passe among the company of roages. But, if he can make money of his men, And his lieutenant to supply his place, Although the cocke be of a crauen henne, And dare not meete a capon in the face; Yet if he can be garded with gold lace, And sweare and swagger with a siluer sword, Who would not feare a stabbe for a foule word? And yet this swappes, that neuer bloodied sword, Is but a coward, braue it as he list: And, though he sweare and stare to keepe his word, He will but loose his armour in the list, Or take the cuffe, and kindely kisse the fist; Stolne honour is a iest of chiualry, And vnto valour open iniury. While he that ventures landes, and goods, and life, To shew the vertue of a valiant heart, And leaues his house, his children and his wife, And from his countrie's quiet will depart, To passe the pikes of Danger's deadly smart; He is the souldier, be he ne're so poore, May write disgrace vpon the coward's doore. But for the Lords and Generals of fields, The serieant-maiors, colonels, and such, Marshalls and captaines, that in Vertue's shields Doe beare the trueth of Valour's honours' tuch; In good of them I cannot say too much, If all their armour were of pearle and gold, That by desert the due of knighthood hold. Take an odde Vicar in a village-towne, That onely prayes for plenty and for peace; If he can get him but a threed-bare gowne, And tithe a pigge, and eate a goose in grease, And set his hand vnto his neighbour's lease, And bid the clearke on Sondayes ring the bell, He is a church-man fits the parish well. But, if he get a benefice of worth, That may maintaine a good hospitality, And in the pulpit bring a figure forth, Of faith and workes with a formality, And tell a knaue of an ill quality; If with his preaching he can fill the purse, He is a good man, God send nere a worse. But yet this simple idle-headed asse, That scarce hath learnd to spell the Hebrew names, Sir Iohn Lack-latine with a face of brasse, Who all by roate his poore collations frames, And after seruice falles to ale-house games, How ere his wit may giue the foole the lurch, He is not fit to gouerne in the Church. While he that spends the labour of his youth, But in the Booke of the eternall blisse, And can and will deliuer but the trueth, In which the hope of highest comfort is, That cannot leade the faithfull soule amisse: Howeuer so his state of wealth decline, Deserues the title of the true diuine. I doe not speake of bishops nor of deanes, Nor learnèd doctors in diuinity; For they are men that rose by godly meanes, Who with the world haue no affinity, But in the worship of the Trinity, Their times, their brains, their loues, and liues do spend, To gaine the honour that shall neuer end. Take but a petti-fogger in the Law That scarce a line of Littleton hath read, If he hath learnd the cunning how to claw His clients back and bring a foole to bed, With beating toyes and trifles in his head; His golden fees will get him such a grace A better lawyer shall not crosse his case. But be a Poore man neuer so well read In all the quirkes and quiddities of Law, And beate his braines and weary out his head Till he haue prou'd a dunce to be a daw; Yet will his skill be held not worth a straw, And he perhaps in pleading of his case With floutes and scoffes be shouldred out of place. But let that pidling petti-fogging Iacke, That faine would seeme a lawyer at the least, Be ne're so busie in a begger's packe, And light vpon the carde that likes him best, Yet shall you see in setting vp his rest: In all the game who so doe loose or saue, His luck will allwaies fall vpon the knaue. While he that hath the honest case in hand, And learnedly can iudge twixt right and wrong, And doth vpon the care of conscience stand, And knowes that sorrow's the afflicted's song; Bids Iustice not the poore man's griefe prolong, But hateth bribes to heare the trueth approoued; He is the lawyer worthy to be loued. But for the Lords and Iudges of the Law, They looke into the matter not the men: They know the mettall if they see the flaw, And iudge the marish if they see the fenne: They know both what, and how, and where, and when, And are as gods on earth to the distressed, To giue the right, and see the wrong redressed. But for our gentle Iustices of Peace, That but the chaire of charity doth keepe, By whose great wisedome many quarrels cease, And honest people doe in quiet sleepe, While their command both watch and ward doth keepe: I say no more, but God preserue their health, They are good members in a Common-wealth. Say coyne can make a painter draw a face, He cannot giue it life, doe what he can: And though that coyne can giue an outward grace, It cannot make a knaue an honest man, It cannot turne the cat so in the pan: But he that hath his eyes may easily finde The difference twixt the body and the minde. Take him that is disfigurèd in the face, And worse in minde and euery where to blame; He shall be but the subiect of disgrace: How euer fortune doe his shadow frame, And in Loue's triumph but a laughing game: For neuer mastiffe curre will be a beagle, Nor euer owle will grow to be an eagle. Looke on a fellow with a filthy face, Snow on his head and frost vpon his beard, And euery where so furnisht with disgrace As well might make a selly foole afeard, And like a smith with sea-coale all besmeard; Yet if he haue his working toole of golde, Venus will helpe to strike, if Vulcan holde. Let but a fellow in a fox-furd gowne, A greasie night-cap and a driueled beard, Grow but the baliffe of a fisher-towne, And haue a matter fore him to be heard; Will not his frowne make halfe a streete afeard? Yea, and the greatest Codshead gape for feare He shall be swallowed by this vgly beare. Looke but on beggars going to the stockes, How master constable can march before them, And while the beadle maketh fast the lockes, How brauely he can knaue them, and be-whore them, And not afford one word of pitty for them, When it may be poore honest seely people, Must make the church make curtsie to the steeple. Note but the beadle of a beggars Spittle, How (in his place) he can himselfe aduance, And will not of his title loose a tittle, If any matter come in variance, To try the credite of his countenance: For whatsoeuer the poore beggars say, His is the word must carry all away. Why let a begger but on cock-horse sit, Will he not ride like an ill-fauourd king? And will it not amaze a poore man's witte, That cuckoes teach the nightingale to sing? Oh, this same wealth is such a wicked thing, T'will teach an owle in time to speake true latine, And make a frier forsweare our Ladie's mattine. Take but a peasant newly from the cart, That only liues by puddings, beanes, and pease, Who neuer learnèd any other arte, But how to driue his cattle to the leas, And after worke, to sit and take his ease: Yet put this asse into a golden hide, He shall be groome vnto a hansome bride. Take but a rascall with a rogish pate, Who can but onely keepe a counting-booke, Yet if his reckning grow to such a rate, That he can angle for the golden hooke, How-euer so the matter he mistooke, If he can cleerely couer his deceite, He may be held a man of deepe conceite. Finde out a Villaine, borne and bred a knaue, That neuer knew where honesty became, A drunken rascall and a doggèd slaue, That all his wittes to wickednesse doth frame, And onely liues in infamy and shame; Yet let him tinke vpon the golden pan, His word may passe yet for an honest man. Why, take a Fidler but with halfe an eye, Who neuer knew if Ela were a note, And can but play a Round or Hey-de-gey, And that perhaps he onely hath by roate, Which now and then may hap to get a groate; Yet if his Crowde be set with siluer studdes, The other minstrels may goe chew their cuddes. Giue mistris Fumkins (Iohn Anods his wife,— The filthiest queane in fifteene countrey townes, Who neuer had good thought in all her life) But one fring'd kertle, and two wosted gownes, And fill her leather powch with a few crownes, She shall haue more fine suters for her marish, Then all the fairest maidens in the parish. Olde Gillian Turne-tripe Iacke an Apes his trull That scarce can chew a peece of new made cheese, Swelld with the dropsie, foule and farting full, With feeding on the fatte of scullions fees; Yet if she haue the golden hony-bees, She shall be kept as cleanly, fine, and fresh As if shee were a sweeter peece of flesh. Let prinking Parnell with a paire of Thumbes That well might serue a Miller's tolling dish; Who thicks her pottage but with brown-bread crummes, And neuer car'd for butter to her fish, Haue but the mettall of the miner's wish; Twenty to one, but she shall quickly marry, When finer wenches will be like to tarry. Looke on old Betresse with her beetle browes, Begot betwixt a tinker and his Tibbe, And but of late a silly coblers spouse; If she haue playde the thrifty prowling scribbe, To purchase grasse to greaze the bullocke's ribbe; She shall be fedde with fine and dainty fare, And woo'd and wedded, ere she be aware. But for a poore wench, be she nere so fayre, Gratious and vertuous, wise and nobly borne, And worthy well to sit in Honor's chaire; Yet, if her kertile, or her gowne be torne, All her good gifts shall be but held in scorne, And she (poore soule) in sorrow and disgrace, Be forc'd to giue a filthy baggage place. So that by all these consequents I see, It is the money makes or marres the man; And yet where iudges will indifferent be, The hobby-horse best fittes Maide-Marrian, While greedy dogges may licke the dripping pan; For though that money may doe many thinges, Yet Vertue makes the truest Queenes and Kings. Oh what a world it is to see what wiles, A silly foole will finde to gather wealth: And how he laughes, when he himselfe beguiles, With getting of the cukoes note by stealth, And thinke all well, it is a signe of health: When Patience hath the vaine to gather pence, It is a fault to trouble conscience. Who doth not see what villanies are wrought, To gather wealth, the ground of wickednesse: How many scholers Machauell hath taught, To fill the earth with all vngodlinesse, While Witte doth onely worke for wealthinesse: Who liues in ebbes, and may let in the floods, But will betray his father for his goods? But what auailes vnto the world to talke? Wealth is a witch that hath a wicked charme, That in the mindes of wicked men doth walke, Vnto the heart and soule's eternall harme, Which is not kept by the Almighty arme: Oh, tis the strongest instrument of ill That ere was knowne to worke the deuill's will. An honest man is held a good poore soule, And kindenesse counted but a weake conceite, And loue writte vp but in the wood-cocke's sowle, While thriuing Wat doth but on wealth awaite, He is a fore-horse that goes euer streight: And he but held a foole for all his wit, That guides his braines but with a golden bit. A Virgin is a vertuous kind of creature But doth not coine command virginitie? And Beautie hath a strange bewiching feature, But golde reads so much world's diuinitie, As with the heauens hath no affinitie; So that where Beautie doth with Vertue dwell, If it want money yet it will not sell. The market doth not serue to looke on mindes, Tis mony makes the way with euery thing; Coyne alters natures in a thousand kinds, And makes a begger thinke himselfe a king, The carter whistle and the cobler sing: Money, oh God, it carries such a grace That it dare meet the diuell in the face. And he that wants this wicked kinde of drosse, May talke of nuttes but feede vpon the shales; Insteede of grasse be glad to gather mosse, And steed of hilles be glad to keepe the dales, With chilling blasts insteede of blessed gales: Valour, wit, honor, vertue, beautie, grace, All little worth if wealth be out of place. The golden tale is euer soonest heard, The golden suter soonest hath dispatch, The golden seruant hath the best regard, And what such marriage as the golden match? And who so wise as is the golden patch? Sweet musicke soundes it in a golden vaine, The sweetest stroke is in the golden straine. And yet for all this, by your leaue awhile, Examine all and giue each one his right, Let not selfe-will a better wit beguile, To take a candle for the sunny light: There is a diffrence twixt the day and night, So is there twixt the riches of the minde, And the base drosse in beggar-thoughts to finde. The wealthy beggar with his golden bagges, Is yet a beggar, maugre all his golde; And noble Vertue, though it be in ragges, May well deserue a better place to holde Then many a one that is for money solde: And tis not wealth can make an ape a man, Cut out his coate the best way that you can. Wealth will not make an old man yong againe, Howeuer so elixers do abuse him, Nor wealth can take out a dishonest staine, Howeuer kindnesse for a time excuse him, Wealth can make the wise but to refuse him: Wealth cannot sweeten an old stincking breath, Nor saue a miser from the dart of Death. A knaue in graine can take none other hue, The counterfeit will quickly shew his kinde, A traitor in his heart cannot be true, The weather-cocke goes euer with the wind, He hath no eies that can no colours finde: Fooles may be blinded with a wilfull mist But wise men will beware of had-I-wist. For he that were as rich as Crœsuc was, Yet if he haue a pare of Midas' eares, He shall be counted but a Golden Asse, Whateuer worship in the world he beares: For Truth herselfe by all her triall sweares In all the rules where reason hath his right, A shadow doth but onely mocke the sight. While he that hath a manly comely feature And wisedome's grace to guide the spirite's will, And with the outward ornaments of Nature, To heauenly comfort bends his inward skill, Although he cannot clime the golden hill, How bare soeuer here be his abode He shall be gratious in the sight of God. He that walkes wanton vith his head aside, And knowes not well how he may see his feete; And she that minceth like a maiden bride, And like a shadow slideth through the streete; Howeuer so their mindes in money meete, Measure their humours iustly by the middle, He may be but a foole and she a fiddle. She that hath a round table at her breech, And like a puppet in her 'parrell dight; He that is all formalitie in speech, And like a rabbet that is set vpright; Howeuer so their purses be in plight, He may be wise, but in his owne opinion, And she accounted but an idle minion. He that with fat goes wallowing like a beare, And puffes and blowes, and gapes to gather ayre; She that all day sittes curling of her hayre, And paints her face to make the fowle seeme faire; Howeuer so their wealth encrease, or paire, He may be held for a butcher's weather, And she a bird but of an idle feather. He like a crane that stalkes along the streete, And ouer-lookes the moone, and all the starres; She that doth softly striue to set her feete, As though her ioynts had lately been at iarres; How-e're their purses breede their peace or warres, He may be counted but the sonne of pride And she perhaps haue an vnwholesome hide. He that doth set his wicked wittes to worke, To coosen and to cony catch his friend; And she that doth in secret corners lurke, To bring young humours to a wicked end; Howeuer so their purses paire or mend She may hap prooue as good as euer twangd And he a rascall, worthy to be hangd. He that doth bring men into bonds of dept, And feede their humors with a card of tenne; She that can mump, and mince, and ierke, and iet As though she were old chaunteclers chiefe hene; How ere their purses build the golden penne, In the best rules that wit and reason haue, She may be thought a queane and he a knaue. He that can fleere, and leere, and looke aside, As though he studied on some weighty case; She that can kindely counterfet the bride, On working dayes to make a Sondaye's face; Howeuer so their purses be in case, He may perhaps haue but a knauish wit, And she perhaps be but a foolish tit. He that will drinke, and sweare, and stabbe, and kill, And will be brought vnto no better stay; She that will brawle, and scold, and haue her will, In spight of whosoeuer dare say nay; Howe're their wealth do beare the world away, He may be fit to keepe the diuels court, And she a match to make a mad-man sport. So that I can see I finde myselfe deceiued, To thinke that mony should monarch it so; Although I thinke I might be well conceiued, To thinke that money make a goodly show, Vnto a minde that doth not mettall know; But he that knowes the flower from the mosse, Will finde it but a necessary drosse. But he that can with conscience and with kindnesse, From a small mole-hil to a mountaine rise; And she that will not with Discretion's blindenesse Lead a poore friend into Foole's Paradise; Let crownes and angels follow them like flies. If they get golde, on God's name let them weare it, He hath a peeuish humour cannot beare it. But let him yet acknowledge what he is, That by his wealth his onely worship getteth; And let her that is such a misteries, Thinke her but fond that so herselfe forgetteth, As labour's lucre euen with honor setteth. Let them, I say, confesse but what they be, And they shall be stil as they are for me: But if King Pippin ouer-looke his basket, I wish a rotte among his apples fall; And if dame Laundresse doe forget her flasket, I wish her losse her crippin, or her cawle, I can not make a parlour of a halle: Let euery rabbet to her borough runne, And then the hunting will be quickly done. But if the hildings care not how they rome, Nor where they range in fetching of their feede; If they be met with in their going home, I can not pitty their vnhappy speede; Who cuttes their fingers must abide them bleede, Who wilfully will venture for a smart, I can not helpe them, if it breake their heart. Then let a knaue be knowne to be a knaue, A theife a villaine, and a churle a hogge; A minkes a menion, and a rogue a slaue, A trull a tit, an vsurer a dogge, A lobbe a loute, a heauy loll a logge: And euery birde goe rowst in her owne nest, And then perhaps my Muse will be at rest. But if a Iacke will be a gentleman, And mistris Needens lady it at least, And euery goose be saucy with the swanne, While the asse thinkes he is a goodly beast, While so the foole doth keepe ambition's feast; My Muse in conscience that cannot be quiet, Will giue them this good sawce vnto their diet. But I doe hope I am but in a dreame, Fooles will be wiser then to loose their wittes; The countrey wench will looke vnto her creame, And workemen see, but where their profite fits, And learne fantastickes to their idle fits: Pride shall goe downe, and vertue shall encrease, And then my Muse be still, and hold her peace. But if I see the world will not amend, The wealthy beggar counterfeite the king, And idle spirites all their humours spend, In seeking how to make the cuckoe sing; If Fortune thus doe daunce in Follie's ring, When contraries thus go against their kindes, My Muse resolues to tell them what she findes. For she cannot be partiall in her speech, To smooth, and flatter, to cologue and lie; She cannot make a breast-plate of a breech, Nor praise his sight that hath but halfe an eie, She cannot doe herselfe such iniurie; For she was made out of so plaine a molde, As doth but Trueth for all her honor holde. FINIS. His Message. Goe Muse abroade, and beate the world about, Tell trueth for shame, and hugger vp no ill; Flatter no follie with too plaine a flowt, Nor on a buzzard set a falcon's bill: Doe no man wrong, giue euery man his right, For time will come that all will come to light. Doe not persuade a foole that he is wise, Nor make a begger thinke he is a king; Say not a mole can see that hath no eyes, Nor starke dead stockes haue any power to spring; For while that logicke would maintaine a lie, Tis easely found out in philosophie. Tell idle eies that know not how to looke, Their wanton thoughts will worke them nought but woes, Tell addle wittes that haue the worlde mistooke, Vnbridled willes are Reason's ouerthrowes: While onely Trueth that walkes by Wisedome's line, Happieth the heart, and makes the soule diuine. Goe to the Court and tell your gratious king, That in his loue his Land hath blessed been; And tell his Land that you haue truely seene, No Court on earth more gracèd in a King; Where Vertue giues a kind of heauenly crown That all the world can neuer tumble downe. There tell the lordes and ladies in their eares, They must be loyall in their humble loues; The fairest badge that honor euer beares, Is, in a crowne a nest of turtle-doues; The crowne of lawrell that can neuer wither, The birdes in loue that liue and die togither. There tell the courtier he doth kindely serue, That of his curtsie cannot make a cloake; Where Bountie's h?d doth honor best deserue, That giues reward before the word he spoke; And tell the gallants that will seeke for graces, Chaste modest eies best figure angels' faces. Goe bid the lawyers looke their Common-places, And where they know the trueth, there giue the right: For God Himselfe who heares the poore mens cases, Will giue a day vnto their darkest night. When in the Booke that doth all thoughts disclose, Their soules shall see whereto iniustice growes. Goe to the learnèd Vniuersities, And tell the schollers of the losse of time; Bid them beware of too much liberties, Best thriuing plants are tended in their prime; And bid them first goe read the rules of grace, That lower blessings may come on apace. Tell country Players, that old paltry iests Pronouncèd in a painted motley coate, Filles all the world so full of cuckoes nests, That nightingales can scarcely sing a note: Oh bid them turne their minds to better meanings, Fields are ill sowne that giue no better gleanings. Goe tell the Fidlers that doe haunt the Faires, They are but coales to kindle wicked fire; Where only pence doe make vnequal paires: Performe the actions of vncleane desires: When in an ale-house in a drunken pot, The diuell daunceth though they see him not. Goe tell the Swaggrers that doe vse to sweare, Heere, or in hell, their mouthes will sure be stopt; And tell the thieues that robbe without a feare, That Tiborne trees must once a month be topt; And tell the cluster of the damnèd crue, Such hell-hounds heauen out of her mouth doth spue. Bid each Diuine goe closely to his booke, And truely teach the comforts of the soule, And to his life to haue a carefull looke; Knowing what actions angels doe enroule, And tell them truely that diuinitie With worldly loue hath no affinitie. Feede not the Souldier with delight of blood, While Mercy is the honour of a field; And tell the Merchant, that ill gotten good, A wretched life a wofull end will yeeld; And tell the Miser vsurer of money, His soule is poysned with his bodie's hunney. Goe tell the Craftesman of his crafty worke, And that his coosoning one day will decay; For long the foxe may in his burrow lurke, That may be catcht in hunting of a pray; And whereas Trueth can only beare a blame Falshood must runne and hide her face for shame. Goe tell the Fencer with his deadly foyne, That Caine and Abell yet are currant weight, Where is more easie for to part then ioyne The soule and body by a wicked sleight; While secret murther in the sinner's brest Will neuer let the soule to be at rest. Goe tell the wretch that would and cannot thriue, That his endeauor standeth for a deed; And bid the sick man in his soule reuiue, While angells ioyes on sinners teares do feede: And tell the soule that mourneth for her sinne Heau'n gates stand open for to let her in. Tell not a crow, that she is lilly white, Because a painter colourd hath her coate; Nor say a cuckoe hath in musicke righte, Because in Maye she hittes vpon a noate; But say the crow is blacke, the cuckoe's horse; The finest carkasse will be but a corse. Tell Aesop's pie, that flies with peaccocke's feathers They are but stolne, or borrowèd, not her owne; And tell the shippe that sailes in roughest weather, Vpon a rocke she may be ouerthrowne; And tell the hart that will not keepe the wood, To graze too farre, will doe him little good. Goe tell the beggar at the rich man's gate, That Lazarus in Abraham's bosome liues; And tell the rich, that Diues' wofull state, Doth shew what almes lacke of pitty giues; And tell the wise that Salomon is dead, While wilfull Fancie brings a fool to bedde. Goe bid the Iailour looke vnto his charge, And not be cruell where he may be kinde; For though a prisoner be not set at large, Yet in his sorrow let him comfort finde; That when the soule at Mercie's doore doth knocke, Pitty on earth may ope the heauenly locke. Goe to the prisoner that doth liue opprest, And tell him patience is a heau'nly power, That in all troubles giues the spirit rest, And makes it happy in a heau'nly hower; When True Remorce that Vertue's griefe doth see, From care and sorrow soone will set him free. Goe tell the Poets that their pidling rimes Begin apace to grow out of request: While wanton humors in their idle times, Can make of Loue but as a laughing iest: And tell poore Writers, stories are so stale, That penny ballads make a better sale. Goe tell the Authors of high Tragedies, That bloudlesse quarrells are but merry fights; And such as best conceite their Comedies, Doe feede their fancies but with fond delights; Where toyes will shew that figure Trueth's intention, They spoyle their spirits with too much inuention. Goe bid the Scriuener looke in his indentures, That no ill couenant a conueiance marre; And tell the Sailer that in sea aduentures, A shippe ill guided splitts vpon a barre; And tell the Fisher when he layes his nets, He fisheth ill that but a gudgin gets. Go tell the Iuglers that their iests are toyes, Where wisedome seeth the worth of little wit; Their exercises but for girles and boyes, That watch the gander while the goose doth sit; Their trickes but trifles, bred by wickednesse, But to deceiue the eye of simplenesse. Go tell the pander and the parasite, The one his tongue is like the other's minde; The parasite without a tooth can bite, The pander liues in a more loathsome kinde; The one, his facultie is flattery, The other, liues by filthy lechery. Go tell the traitour, if thou hitst of any, That Iudas is a prologue to their play; And tell the world that Iudasses too many, In secret corners spring vp euerie day; Who, since both heau'n and earth may well abhorre, Goe hang themselues as he hath done before. Go to the Countrey, where the farmers dwell, And bid them bring their corne out to the poore; Tell them the sexton comes to ring the bell, Wh? death will fetch the richest out of doore; And they too late to their sorrow shall see, How churles on earth in hell shall plaguèd be. Goe tell the Labourers, that the lazie bones That will not worke, must seeke the beggar's gaines And tell the beggar that his fainèd groanes, Must haue a whippe to ease him of his paines; While workemen's labour, and the lame man's woe In wisedome's eye cannot vnpittied goe. Thus, not in order seeke out euery one, But as thou meetst them, tell them what I bid thee; But if thou seest thou canst doe good of none, Of gracelesse schollers quickly seeke to rid thee; Such as determine in their sinnes to dwell, Thou canst not helpe them if they run to hell. But lest thy worke be all to much to doe, Beginne againe and I will make an end; But haue a care of that I set thee to, Lest I discarde thee euer for a friend; But take good heed, begin where I begun, And make an end, and I will soone haue don. Goe bid the Courtier that he be not prowde, The Soldier bloody, nor the Lawyer blinde; And bid the Merchant, that he doe not shrowde A subtle meaning in a simple kinde; Goe bid the Schollers learne, the Doctors teach, And haue a care to liue as they doe preach. Goe bid the Farmer bring abroad his graine, The Craftesman, that he soundly make his ware, The Workeman, that he labour for his gaine, The Beggar that he waite for pittie's share; Then if the Sexton come to ring the bell, Where Faith is fixt, there is no feare of Hell. Forbid the Poets, all fantasticke humors, The Players, acting of vnlawfull iests, The Prose-men, raising of unciuill rumors, The Fidlers, playing but at Bride-ale feasts, The Fencers, fight but onely to defende, That easie quarrels sóone may haue an ende. Goe tell the Spend-thrift that doth sell his land. Money will melt like snow against the sunne; And he that takes his rent vp afore-hand, May hap to want before the yeare be done; And tell a Foole, that plaies on better wittes, A lowzie head will quickly shew his nittes. Goe bid the Scriuener looke he truely write, And tell the Iugler, that his feates are stale; And bid the Sailer looke his shippes be tight, And take the blowing of a merry gale; And bid the Fisher lay for bigger fish, A world of gudgins will not fill a dish. Goe tell the Rich Man, that his store of wealth, Wil purchase him no place in Paradise; And bid the strong man boast no more of health, For as the lambe we see the lyon dies; And bid the wise man boast not of his wits, Lest vnawares he fall to madding fits. Goe bid the Iaylour looke vnto his lockes, And keepe his keyes, and feare no prisoners flight; And keepe his rackes, his tortures, boltes and stockes, To make a traitor bring a trueth to light; But to his power to helpe the poore oppressèd, For God is pleasd in pittying the distressèd. Goe bid the Poets studie better matter, Then Mars and Venus in a tragedie; And bid them leaue to learne to lie and flatter, In plotting of a Louer's Comedie; And bid Play-writers better spend their spirits, Than in fox-burrows, or in cony-ferrits. Do not allure a wanton eye to loue, Nor seeke with wordes to witch an itching eare; Play not the turky with a turtle-doue, Nor fray a baby with a painted beare; Finde better worke to set thyselfe vnto, As good be idle, as haue nought to doe. Follow not follies, shadowes, nor conceites, For in the end they will but ill deceiue thee; Practice no iestings, nor no iugling sleights, For in the end discretion will perceiue thee; And when that woe and want doth ouertake thee, Fortune will faile thee, and the world forsake thee. Loose not thy time with looking after toyes, Nor fall to building castles in the ayre; Let Nature's iewells neuer be thy ioyes, But loue the beauty of the inward faire; Where e're thou goe, let trueth and vertue guide thee, And then be sure no euill can betide thee. Spend not thy patrimony in apparrell, In cardes nor dice, in horses, hawkes, or houndes; Maintaine thy right, but make no idle quarrell, And keepe thyselfe within Discretion's boundes; Abuse no friend, nor trust an enemy, And keepe thyselfe from wicked company. Reuenge no wrong, except it bee too greate, True valour liues in sparing, not in spilling; Deny no truce that Mercy doth intreate, A cruell conquest that doth end in killing: For Patience findes that poison's wrath to death, An angry word is but an angry breath. Bid them feare God that meane to shun the deuill And hate the deuill that would come to God, And say, when children are enclinde to euill Parents sometime of force must vse the rodde; For sinne is hatefull in Iehouah's eyes, And Man his life but in His mercie lyes.

      <field name="fulltext">PASQVILS FOOLES-CAP SENT TO SVCH (TO keepe their weake braines warme) as are not able to conceiue aright of his Mad-cap. With Pasquils Passion for the Worlds waywardnesse. Begun by himselfe, and finished by his Friend MORPHORIVS. TO MY VERY GOOD friende, Master Edward Conquest, as much happinesse from Heauen, as his worthy heart can wish. TO HIS HONEST friende Pasquill in all haste. Morphorius to the Reader, in the behalfe of his friende Pasquill. Hee, that of late was in a Madding fit, Doth from a franzy to a folly fall: And which is better, madde, or foolishe witte? I thinke as good, almost haue none at all. Well, Sugar sweete, or bitter as the gall, Tis Pasquils humour, so I pray you take it: And as you like it, chuse it, or forsake it. His meaning was, to please none but himselfe, Nor to displease but those that well deserue it: He doth not care though Enuy play the elfe: His dishe is drest, and hee will not Reserue it: But to the world, for such poore diet serue it, As are content with ordinarie dishes, While Nicer Gulles are choakt with Gugin fishes. When he was Madde, hee Rag'd against the knaue: Now idely fitted, falles vpon the Foole, In hope that Doctors better wisdome haue, Than Carpe at schollers that doe goe to schoole And wishe a workeman but to knowe his toole: For Graues-end Barge can neuer passage haue, Till it be furnisht with a Foole or Knaue. FINIS. PASQVILS Fooles-Cap. What meanes this world, that Muses can not rest, But one or other will be working still? Tis no time now to breake too broad a iest; Least, had I wist, repent a heedlesse will, While hammering skonces haue vnhappy skill Which in their Cradles, being borne accurst, Will euer construe all things to the woorst. But since the Wisdome of the world I finde, Before Heauens Wisdome, Foolishnesse indeede, While such Illusions doe the spirit blinde, As onely growe vpon vngratious seede: Which wicked Humours in the heart doe breede, While truest Wisdome liues aboue the Sunne: Let me but play the Foole, and I haue done. But some, perhaps, in pieuish spight will say, The fielde is large, wherein I am to walke: Where I may wander many an idle way, And make a deale of fiddle faddle talke: But say, my Muse mistake greene Cheese for Chalke, This is the worst (to hide her idle braines) She shall haue but the Fooles-cappe for her paines. But let her weare it, since it is her due, Who hath no Wisdom, can not speake of Wit: Who neuer came where Wit and Reason grue, Must needs shoot wide, when that they aim at it. For, while the Gander by the Goose doth sit, Tis ten to one, how euer prooue the weather, But that the birds will all be of a feather. Then, good Wise Man, if such a one thou bee, That dost the lines of little matter reade, I pray thee be not in a chase with mee, Although a Iade be spurrèd till hee bleede: Keepe thou thy Stable for a better Steede: Who hath beene well brought vp in Reasons Schoole, May haue the patience to goe by the Foole. But, if it bee, you cannot goe along, But that you needes will stumble at a strawe; If that your selfe will doe your selfe such wrong, To let the Worme vpon your Wits to gnawe, Vntill a Crowe be come to be a Dawe: Then do but thinke how some the Ieast will smother, Why should one Foole be angry with another? Then be not angry, let the Foole alone, Except thou be a bird of his owne broode: For trust it true, it will be ten to one, If once thy heade be couerd with his Hoode, It will so heate thy braines, and staine thy bloode, That thou wilt fall into such Extasies, As while thou liu'st, thou neuer wilt be wise. Beware therefore in time of Had I wist: Let not Impatience shewe thy pieuishnesse: Keepe thy Conceipt within Discretions List: Where thou maiest looke vpon that Idlenesse, That fils the world too full of Foolishnesse: Seeke thou to knowe but where true wit doth dwell, And learne to laugh at Fooles, and all is well. And if thou chaunce to meete an idle Mate, Whose tongue goes all too glibbe vpon the seare, And chiefe delight is so much in his prate, As where hee comes, will be chiefe Prater there: In friendly kindnesse tell him in his eare, That in the Rules of Wit and Reasons schoole, He will be counted but a prating foole. And if you hap to light vpon a Gull, That is conceipted of his Mother wit, And doth apply his beetle-headed scull But to an humour of an idle fit; In honest kindnesse let him heare of it, That in the Rowles of Wisdomes Rules you reede, Lesse hope of him, then of a Foole indeede And if you chaunce to see the Sonne of Pride Looke fifteene thousand mile aboue the Moone, And lye abedde vntill his idle hide Must make a Morning, of an after-noone: For feare his Worshippe should be vp too soone; Least that the Ayer should happe to doe him harme, Lend him the Fooles-cappe for to keepe him warme. And if you chaunce to spy a Subtill Slaue, That hath a world of Simple wits beguilde, And, like a cunning cogging, coosening knaue, On other harmes, his helpes doth onely builde: Tell him that Sathan is a subtill childe, That while the wicked golde for drosse doe sell, Makes Fooles seeme wise, vntill they come in hell. Hee that doth murther twentie thousand men, And sacke their cities, and their townes deface: And, with a dash but of a wicked Penne, Bring a poore world into a pitious case, To gaine himselfe a kinde of Monarches grace: Tell him what Angels read in Vertues schoole, That bloudy Pride doth breede a hellish Foole. Hee that doth couet more then is his owne, And scrapes and scratcheth for a little drosse: And, all with ease is like a Bladder blowne, And neuer cares for any neighbours crosse, For his owne gaine, to giue a thousand losse: Tell him when Wisdome beates the world about, The Foole will quickly lay the Miser out. The swaggring Huffecappe that will stare and sweare, That hee will cut through the whole piece of cloath; And face to face, will meete the olde blinde Beare, And breake the Canne, that's fillèd vp with froath, And cares not how he throwe away an oath: Let him be sure when Vertues Honours fall, In Wisdomes Court he hath no place at all. The sneaking Coward that doth closely creepe, And feareth euery shadowe where hee goes: And of himselfe both watch and warde doth keepe, For feare his Friendes should growe to be his Foes: Doth so much title of true Manhoode lose, That hee may reade what Truthe in honour tries, A Coward neuer can be truely wise. The Idle Spendthrift that will sell his land, To feede the humours of an addle heade: And sowes his seede vpon the barren sand, Till late Repentance liue to begge his bread: Let him beleeue what many a one hath read, Howeuer Fancy make excuse for it, Such Had I wist had neuer happy wit. Hee that doth thinke that Wit is but in Wealth, And plots to purchase kingdomes with a Purse, And neuer thinketh of the Spirits health: But doth his heart with wicked humours nurse, And for a blessing, falles vpon a curse: Let him confesse, if in heau'ns blessings blot, Hee finde himselfe a wicked Foole, or not. Hee that lookes Babies in his Mistris eyes, And beates his braines to tell an Idle tale: And thinkes himselfe, that hee is wondrous wise, That breakes a Ieast, though it be nere so stale: And for a Nut, crackes nothing but a Shale: How ere hee thinke of his owne wit amisse, Wisdome will tell him, what a Foole hee is. She that is neither noble, faire, nor wise, Nor scarce so rich as a newe shornèd Eawe; And yet, conceited in her owne foule eyes, When shee is dabbled three foote in the deawe, That shee may seeme a prettie handsome shrewe: Let her not thinke, but such a Shut the doore Is halfe a Foole, and if she be no more. Hee that hath neither Trueth nor Honestie, Good hand, good legge, good body, nor good face, Nor any such exceeding qualitie As may aduaunce him vnto Honours place: Yet, thinkes himselfe a man of speciall grace. When mad-men treade the Woodcockes Morris daunce, Giue him the Fooles-cappe for his Cognisaunce. Shee that is fifteene mile about the waste, And all with fat vnable is to goe, Yet makes her face vp in a piece of paste As though she were an Image of Rie Dowe; Tell her but trueth that Wit and Reason knowe, That this is all, that Fame doth her affoorde, A filthie Owle is but a foolish Birde. Hee that doth hit vpon a printed booke, And findes a name neere fitting to his owne, And of his owne poore wit hath vndertooke The ground of all hath from his humor growne, When euery Bird is by her feather knowne, Pasquill doth tell him that poore Æsops Pie Will shewe him how his Wit hath gone awry. Hee that doth marry, all for Wanton-loue, And hath no Reason for his fond affection: But all too late doth with Repentance proue The wofull fruites of wretched wils direction, While Want and Sorrowe are the Soules correction: Tell him, such babies may the dugge goe sucke: While louing Fooles haue neuer better lucke, Shee, in a glasse, that sees her Sorrell haire, And straight will put it to the Painters die, And then doth thinke that shee is wondrous faire; When flatt'ry feedes her humour with a Lie, Oh, let her not in such an errour die; But bid her kindly cracke this friendly Nut, So fowle a Dowd' is but a foolish Slut. Hee that delights to tell an idle tale, Vpon the prattle of a cogging Mate, And carelessely his credit set to sale; Which being noted for his foolish prate, He shall be sure to finde although too late That Wisdom reades these Rounds in Reasons schooles; Newes-Carriers are next Neighbours vnto Fooles. She that doth file her tongue for Eloquence, To entertaine a world with Idle talke: And thinkes shee hath the very Quintescence, Of quicke conceite, wherein her wits do walke Yet doth not knowe a Buzzard from a Hawlke: Let her beleeue, such giddie headed Tittes Are not commended for the truest Wittes. Hee that doth loue to talke of Robin-Hoode, Yet neuer drewe one Arrowe in his Bowe: And yet doth thinke his skill is wondrous good, That scarce the compasse of a marke doth knowe When such a Goose-cappe doth a shooting goe, Tell him, that in the aime of Wisdomes eye, Wide handed Wits will euer shoote awry. Hee that doth put his state vpon his friendes, In hope of grace, when all his good is lost, Shall finde his Wit not worth two puddings endes, When want of pence to reckon with the Hoste, Doth make the Begger chalke vpon the poste: Whose base condition doth too plainely showe, Hee was not wise, that plaide the Woodcocke so. Shee that doth thinke, shee hath a rare conceite, That giues the Cuckoe to her kindest friend; And laughes to thinke vpon that close deceit, That doth but breede Repentance in the ende; Tell her, if shee the sooner not amend, Wisdom sets downe, that knows what Wit doth meane A wicked Drabbe is but a foolish queane. He that is proud of his conceipted wit, When he can cogge, and cozen, prate, and lie: And place himselfe with better men to sit, Then may beseeme so base a Rascaldry, As is too farre from thought of Chyualry; When euery Asse his due reward shall haue, The Fooles-cappe is too good for such a Knaue. Hee that in heart doth say there is no God, And neither thinkes of Heau'n, nor yet of Hell: Nor hath a feeling of that heau'nly Rodde, That makes the Sowle, in Sorrowes teares to tell How Mercie doth within the Spirit dwell: Within the booke of Wisdomes blessed Schoole The Lord of Heauen hath set him downe a Foole. Hee that will lende more then he well may spare And he that spendes all that he hath and more; And onely trusteth vnto Fortunes share, And cares not how he runne vpon the score, Vntill the Begger meete him at his dore: Wisdome will tell him truely in the end, Hee is a Foole that is not his owne friend. She that can looke as mildely as a Lumbe, Yet is a Tigre inwardly in hearte; And cares not how, nor where she leaue the Ramme, When she hath gotten once the rutting parte: It is a Rule, in Wit and Reasons Arte, That she, that hath no better natur'd Wit The Wise will tearme a doggèd foolish Tit. Hee that is brought vp idly in his Youth, And scornes to labour in his elder yeeres, And neuer thinkes vpon the day of Ruthe, Went want (entangled in the Beggers breers) The heauie sound of helpelesse Sorrowe heares: Let him beleeue, that Trueth doth plainely wright; The Fooles-cappe fits the Idle begger right. Hee that can plot a world of villany, And neuer cares what Vertues loue deserueth: And sortes himselfe with wicked company, That from the way of perfect Wisdome swarueth While Mercies hand the gratious heart preserueth That sinfull wretch will finde in Sathans schoole, A damnèd villaine is a cursed Foole. Hee that doth fill his Cophers full of Goulde Yet will not weare good Cloathes on his backe But doth a kinde of Clownish humor houlde To haue his Garment cut out, like a sacke And thinkes Redde Herings haue a daintie smacke: Tell him in kindenesse (that he may not quarrel) The Fooles-cappe will be fit for his Apparrell. Shee that is giuen to Ease and Sluttishnesse, And trifles out the time in Trompery: And yet will thinke it is no pieuishnesse, To feede her selfe with Idle Foppery; May hap to finde in Sorrowes Misery, That when the Grashopper doth leaue to sing, An idle Hielding is a foolish thing. Hee that doth studie twentie things at once, And hath intent for to performe them all: And yet his beetle addle-headed skonce, In full conclusion can doe none at all: If that the Fooles-cappe to his fortune fall, Let him not thinke but it will finely fit. The Idle heade, that hath no better Wit. Shee that is giuen to Pride and Brauery, And Ruffin-like, will sweare, and swash it out; And studies nothing els but Knauery To bring a wicked kinde of world about; And cares not whome she followes with a flout: Such foolish Kittes of such a skittish kinde, In Bridewell booke are euery where to finde. Hee that is here to day, yonder to morrowe And cares not how hee raungeth here and there: Nor careth what hee can or begge, or borowe, To spende or spoile, he cares not how nor where: Oh, tell that Idle Fellowe in his eare, If that hee doe not take the greater care, The Foole will catch him, ere hee be aware. Shee that doth loue to gossippe, and to tattle, And leaues her house to keepe it selfe alone: And cares not how she spend the time in prattle, Till shee haue bar'd her Husband to the boane: Let her not thinke but such an Idle Ioane Must haue this note set downe vpon her name; A Tattling houswife is a foolish Dame. Hee that can combe his head and curle his bearde, And set his Ruffes, and weare his Cloake in print, And by his side can finely weare his swearde, And learne to fleere, and leere, and looke a squint And keepe his steppes, within a measures stint: Let him be sure to passe with this good flout: Hee lackes the Fooles-Cappe yet to set him out. Hee that is well in seruice entertainde And iustly hath the due of his desart; And by his labour findes that hee hath gainde The carefull comfort of an honest heart; Yet fondly will with such a Master part: Tell him what Truthe doth by Experience knowe: Hee is a Foole, leaues such a Master, so. Hee that will let his Wit to runne on Wheeles, And in proude tearmes will with his betters stand, Vntill his Tongue be tempered by his heeles, Vntill his Braines haue better manners scand: And if the Foole doe take him by the hand, Bid him haue Patience, to endure the sounde; That lacke of Wit will lay a Foole aground. Hee that in Libels takes delight to write, And cares not whom hee wickedly defame; But pieuishly will shewe a baggage spite, To touch the Honour of an Honest name: What shall I say, that hee is much to blame? Yea and so much, as for his idle vaines Hee well deserues the Fooles-cappe for his paines. Hee that hath all his studie in the Clowdes, And all misliketh euery thing hee reedes: And what the Sunne within her Circle shrowdes, All in the height his haughty Humour feedes: If hee doe chaunce to light on Herbes for Weedes, Hee is but foolish: rise he nere so soone That runnes in haste to ouertake the Moone. He that will Reade, before he learne to Spell; And write a Booke, before he knowe a Blot; And keepe a Shoppe, before he learne to sell; And all to galloppe ere hee learne to trot: Whither such one thinke himselfe wise or not, Let him be sure that better wits doe reede, Such Madhead fellowes are but Fooles indeede. Hee that with pleasure followes Cardes and Dice, Drinking and wenching, and such Idle sportes: Vntill too late Repentance knowe the price Of Patience passage to Saint Sorrowes portes; Whereto the Begger most of all resortes: Oh let him knowe when he doth comfort lacke The Begger Foole will haue him by the backe. Shee that doth finde her Husband true and kinde, And for her wants to worke both night and day: Yet like the Wethercocke, with euery winde, Will turne her Humour euery idle way, And cares not how hee fall into decay, So shee be fedde according to her fit; She is a Baggage, and a foolish Tit. Hee that is married to an honest wife, That, as her life, in loue doth holde him deare: With whome his heart may haue a quiet life, And, in content, liue many a merry yeare: Yet leaues a Doe to take a Rascall Deere: The fruites of Will do prooue his Wit accurst, That so will leaue the best, to take the worst. He that doth enuie euery mans good happe, And knowes not how to get himselfe in grace: And layes his Loue but all in Fortunes lappe, Whose custome is her followers to deface: When hee is fallen into a pitious case, O let him knowe, before he hang himselfe An enuious foole is euen such an Elfe. Shee that doth keepe an Inne for euery Guest, And makes no care what winde blowe vp her skirt, And readie is to breake a Chaucers ieast, To make a Smocke euen measure with a Shirt: If such a one be call'd a Foolish flirt, Twas not for nothing that she had her name, When all the world is witnesse to her shame. Hee that doth take the lawe, but as a Ieast, And will be hangd but for good fellowshippe, And thinkes it nothing to be halter blest, When from the Gallowes it is but a skippe: Oh, let him not in anger hang the lippe, If by desert thus due reward hee take; He was a Foole, that hangd for fashion sake. Hee that wil weary out his friends with borrowing, And be behoulding to an Enemy, And kill himselfe with too much Sorrowing, To thinke, the touch of Treasons villany Should make such worke in wicked company: Wisdome will tell him, what Experience tries, That kinde of Wit will neuer make him Wise. Hee that importunes an approuèd friend, And hee that feares to speake where hee may speede; And in beginning, lookes not to the end; But loues to glorie in a Wicked deede, And will his heart with wicked humours feede: These Wits doe shewe (that are so fitly matcht) A neast of Fooles, that Wisdome neuer hatcht. Hee that doth set his hand to euery Bill And neither cares for Right or Equitie, And onely bendeth his vnhappie skill, But to the ouerthrowe of Honesty: Fooles, that are so neere in affinitie, When Wisdome makes a tryall of true Wit, Not one of these that hath to doe with it. Hee that doth build high Castles in the Ayre, Vntill they headlong tumble on his necke: And hee that will not an old Shippe repaire Till it be too farre tainted with a leake: If that the Woodcocke giue his Wits the peake: Let him not chafe if that it be his chaunce, To weare the Fooles-Cappe, in a Moris-daunce. Hee that can play on Twentie hands at once, And turnes his humor vnto euery time: And hath his Spirit temperèd for the nonce, To set his flowers onely in the prime: If when he thinkes most warily to clime, By due desart a breake neck-fall hee haue, His craft doth prooue him but a Foolish knaue. He that will talke of euery thing hee knowes, And credit giue to euery thing hee heares: And builds his knowledge only on suppose, Yet vnderstands not what too plaine appeares: How young or ould soeuer be his yeares, Who of his poore Wit giueth witnesse so; Thinke him an arrant Foole, and let him goe. Hee that doth wonder at a Weathercocke, And plaies with euery feather in the winde, And is in loue with euery Nannicocke; Yet scarcely knowes an Orange by the Rinde: When euery Foole is found out in his kinde, How is it possible but he should passe, For a poore silly simple witted Asse? Hee that doth thinke it is no Wickednesse, To lead a young man into Wantonnesse; But takes delight in all Vngodlinesse; Vntil the Heart in Sorrowes heauinesse, Doe shewe the fruites of Wils vnhappinesse; Let that vile villaine reade in Vertues Schooles, Such wicked wretches are Vngratious Fooles. Hee that will chaunge a Iennet for a Iade, And put his Land into a little House: And, in the way where Little Wit doth wade, Watch a great Mountaine for a little Mowse, And sits to feede a Monkey with a Lowse: Where Will is so in folly ouergone, Wisdome sayes plainely, his is small or none. Hee that will put his state vpon aduenture And may be safe and if it please himselfe; And hee that bindes his seruice by Indenture, To baggage courses for a little pelfe: If that his Shippe doe runne vpon a Shelfe, Let him not thinke, but that poore Wit of his, From Wisdomes Course, was carried quite amisse. Hee that will creepe vnto an olde Ioynt-stoole, And serue a Thatcher for a Bunch of strawe, And he that goes to worke without his toole, And loues to wrangle with a Man of Lawe, And thinkes no Birde so prettie as a Dawe: How ere such one be of his Wit conceiued, Wisdome will tell him he is much deceiued. Hee that will treade a Measure as he walkes, And counterfaite Maide Marians countenance: And loues to fall into those whisper talkes, That bring poore Wit into a pitious traunce: If that the Foole doe light on him by chaunce, He must assume what Fates to him assigne: I can not helpe him, tis no fault of mine. Hee that will Drinke vntill his braines be merry, And Eate vntill his stomacke be too full, And Lie a bed vntill his boanes be wearie, And Prate so long vntill he prooue a Gull: If that such braines be lin'd with Ganders wooll, When such Wise creatures put their Wits together, To chuse the wisest, who knowes which is whether? Hee that all day sits blowing at a cole, And neuer leaues till hee put out the fire: And hee that houlds his finger in a hole, To please the humour of a fond desire: And hee that loues to trample in the mire: When these wise men togither make a play, The Foole will runne with all their Wits away. He that will in an humour leaue a friend, And in a furie fall vpon a foe: While ill beginnings make as bad an end, When poore Repentance doth too late beshrowe The heedlesse Will, that Wit doth ouerthrowe: That Foole must needes be turn'd vnto the List, Emong the number of the Had I wist. Hee that will tell his secrets to a stranger, And play the Coward with an enemie: Hee that will put himselfe in needelesse daunger, To followe a mad headed companie: Let him take heede a sodaine villany Make him not finde in true Repentance Schoole, A backward Wit lackes little of A Foole. Hee that will weare his wealth vpon his backe, Yet in his purse doth scarce his dinner carry: And hee that saies to giue his neck the cracke, Because he will not for his fortune tarry: If such a Foole become a Buzzards quarry, When Carelesse Will doth shew his Wit so smal, Tis not my fault, I cannot doe withall. Hee that doth studie out his braines in trifles, And misse the humour of a better marke: And cosens his conceite with Foolish nifles, In taking of a Bunting for a Larke, And euery Pibble for a Diamond sparke: Hee that doth so his Will to folly fit, Doth plainely shewe he hath no perfect Wit. Hee that can eate no other Meate but Milke, And for his Horse, must haue an Ambling Nagge: And cannot weare a Shirt, but soft as Silke: Nor keepe his Coyne, but in a Golden Bagge, And must be knowne his Mothers kindest Wagge: Such smoothèd Godsons shew in Wisdomes schoole, A Milk-soppe Babie is more halfe a Foole. Hee that will be afraide of euery dreame, And thinketh euery puddle is a poole: And runnes ten miles to eat a messe of Creame, And cannot sit but on a Cushin stoole: If such a Noddy be not thought a foole, Hee hath great fauour in the Rule of Wit, That sees his Weaknesse, and concealeth it. Hee that doth fill his heade so full of humours, Hee knowes not where he may in quiet sit: And hee that loues to raise vnciuill rumours, Vntill that Iustice doe in Iudgement sit, Vpon the workes of such a wicked wit: Such wicked Wits, for honest peoples health, Might well be banisht from a Common wealth. Hee that all night doth watch a Conny borough, To catch a Ferret, that hath broke his Muzzle: And hee that squats a Hare within a furrowe, And sees how shee within her Muce doth Nuzzle; And yet so long about the Bush doth puzzle, That she is gone ere he can well beset her, Which of these two good Fooles, may be the better? Hee that put all to the latter day, To reckon euen with all the world at once: And in the meane time is at such a stay He knowes not how to vse his addle Skonce: If such an Asse be noddied for the nonce, I say but this, to helpe his Idle fit; Let him but thanke himselfe for lacke of Wit. Hee that wilfully falles into offence, And satisfaction neuer cares to make: But carelessely stands in his owne defence, While that the Foole his Wits doth ouertake: When late Repentance makes his heart to ake, Hee scapeth well, if (for such idle vaines) Worse then the Fooles-cappe answere not his paines, Hee that loues to be noted for strange fashions, And for his lockes, and for his kinde of gate: And in his Muses, and his Passions, Will not be thought an ordinary mate: If that his Wittes come to themselues, too late, I know not well how to be his Aduiser; But euen be sory, that he was no wiser. He that will hoorde vp all for a deere yeare; Yet in the meane time want neceseities: He that will be vnto himselfe so neere, As bring himselfe into extreamities, By his owne wilfull caus'd calamities, This is the end that will fall out of it; Such Niggard Fooles haue neuer better Wit. Hee that doth put his wealth vpon a Cocke, A Carde, a Die, or such an Idle toy; And hath his humour so much on the Smocke, As if it were his Spirits onely ioy: When Soorrowes sighes doe shewe the heartes annoy: Let him goe backe vnto Repentance schoole, And see how long his Wit hath plaid the Foole. Hee that will busie be with Euery matter, Yet scarce hath power to bring one well to passe: And neuer leaues to cosen, lie, and flatter, Vntill hee prooue himselfe a Craftie Asse: Let him but looke in the Foles looking Glasse, And there his Woodcocke Wit shall plainly haue The true proportion of a Paltry Knaue. Hee that would perswade himselfe He is a King, Yet all the world doth for a Begger knowe him: And he that takes the Winter for the Spring, Because the Sunne a little light doth showe him: If want of Wit doe wholly ouerthrowe him, And that the Cockes combe to his cappe doe fall, Tis not my fault, I can not doe withall Hee that puts fifteene elles into a Ruffe And seauenteene yards into a swagg'ring slappe: And twentie thousand Crownes into a Muffe, And halfe his land into a hunting Cappe: If that the foole doe catch him in his trappe, There like a Woodcocke let him walke about: When hee is in, I cannot helpe him out. Hee that in all his thoughts is so vnholy, Hee makes no care of any good conceight: But giues himselfe so much to Idle folly, That vnto Hell hee runnes the highway straight: If hee be poysoned with the Diuels baight, I cannot choose but tell him like a friend, Such wicked Fooles will haue a wofull end. Hee that will Brase his face at Lothebury, Because he will not blush at Knauery: And he that will refuse no drudgery, To gather Drosse by any Slauery, And yet will stand vpon his Brauery: He is no foole, whoeuer be an Asse, Makes such a Couer for a looking glasse. Hee that repents him of no wickednesse, Nor takes delight in any godlinesse: But in the way of all vnthriftinesse, Doth wast the Time of Natures wretchednesse; Where helplesse Sorrowes, in vnhappinesse, Doe breede the Spirits endlesse heauinesse: That Foole is in the height of foolishnesse. Hee that regardes not how hee vse his speech, Nor careth how the world doe goe about, Nor maketh reckening who beholde his breech, Nor how hee play the Logger headed lowte: Where Wisemen liue, if hee be beaten out, Let him be patient, if it come to passe A beastly Foole be handled like an Asse. Hee that doth make his Tongue a two hand sword, And only seekes his Honour all by stealth: And cares not how hee falsifie his worde, Nor by how much disgrace to gather wealth: Howeuer so his Carcasse be in health, Wisdom describes him, in true Honours schoole, A Gull, a Knaue, a Coward, and a Foole. Hee that doth gaine more, then he well may spend, And prattles more then Trueth doth vnderstand: And in his actions, alwaies doth intend Vpon the stay of wicked workes to stande: If that the Diuell take him by the hand, Let him beleeue what highest Trueth doth tell; Hee is a Foole, that leaueth Heau'n for Hell. Hee that doth take a Shadowe for a Substance; And yet doth thinke he hath a perfect sight: And hee that takes an Humour for an Instance; And yet beleeues his braines be in the right: Hee that in darknesse so doth looke for light (How euer Will do take his Wittes to schoole) Wisdome in deede will finde him but a Foole. Hee that hath once a piece of worke begunne, And knowes not how nor when to make an end: And hee whose will his Wittes doth ouerrunne, To make a Foe in wronging of a Friend: Hee that doth so amisse his Spirit spend, (Howeuer so his owne conceit doe deeme him) Wisdome in deede will but a Foole esteeme him. Hee that is Esau for Vnthriftinesse, And followes Caine in his vngodlinesse: And loues Achitophell for wickednesse, And is a Iudas, in vnfaithfulnesse, Whateuer showe he make of holinesse: That man I finde in too much foolishnesse, Hath redde the Scripture in vnhappinesse. Hee that of Machauile doth take instruction To manage all the matters of his thought; And treades the way but to his owne destruction, Till late Repentance be too dearely bought, Shall finde it true, that hath beene often taught: As good be Idle as to goe to schoole, To come away with nothing but the Foole. For feare whereof, least some of mine owne sect (That haue but plaid the Fooles, with lacke of Wit) Doe kindely tell mee of my Cares neglect, In finding humours for the time more fit: While wicked Spirits doe their venome spit: I will conclude (to prooue worlds Wit an Asse) Mans Wit is vaine, shalbe, and euer was. Sapientia mundi, stultitia coram Deo. Pasquils passion for the worlds waiwardnesse. Wicked, vngratious, and vngodly Age, Where hatefull thoughts are gotten to their height, How should my spirit in true passions rage? Describe the courses of thy vile conceight, That feede the world but with the diuels baight: While wofull hearts, with inward sorrowes wounded, Finde Wit and Reason in their sense confounded. No, no, the depth of thy vnknowne distresse (Wherein the heart is ouerwhelm'd with woes) Exceedes the power of passion to expresse; While so much griefe within the Spirit growes, As all the power of Patience ouerthrowes: While vertuous minds, within their sowles agrieued. Must helplesse die, and cannot be relieued. The clearest eye must seeme to haue no seeing, And Eloquence must be to silence bound, And Honours essence seeme to haue no beeing, Where wicked windes runne Vertues shippe a ground, While healthfull spirits fall into a swound; That only Pride, that weares the golden horne, May liue at ease and laugh the world to scorne. If euery right were rightly apprehended, And best deseruings best might be regarded, And Carefull workes were to their worth commended, And Gratious spirits gratiously rewarded, And wicked craft from Conscience care discarded; Then might the Angels sing in Heauen, to see What blessed courses on the earth would be. But oh, the world is at another passe, Fooles haue such Maskes, men cannot see their faces: There is such flattery in a looking Glasse, That winking eyes can not see their disgraces, That are apparant in too open places: But what auailes vnto a wicked minde? No eye so clowdy, as the wilfull blinde. To see the sleight of subtill sneaking spirits (That dare to see the Glasse of their disgraces) Thriue in the World, while better natur'd merits Can not aspire vnto those blessed places, Where faithlesse hearts should neuer shewe there faces: Would it not grieue an honest heart to knowe it? Although the tongue be sworne it may not showe it. To see a harse of seruice in the field, Hurt by a Iade, that can but kicke and fling: To see Vlisses weare Achilles shield, While hissing Serpents haue a Hellish sting: To see the Knaue of Clubbes take vp the King. Although hee be a wicked helpe at Mawe. Twas but a clowne that yet deuis'd the lawe. To see a sight of Curres worry a Hound, A flight of Buzzards fall vpon a Hawke, A coward villaine giue a Knight a wound, To heare a Rascall to a King to talke, Or see a Peasant crosse a Princes walke: Would it not fret the heart that doth behould it. And yet in figures may not dare vnfolde it? But what a kinde of wretched world is this! They that are honest, let them be so still. Such as are settled in their course amisse, Haue much adoe for to reforme their will. It is the winde that driues about the Mill, That grindes the Corne that sometimes fils the Sacke, That laide awry may breake the Loaders backe. What shall I say? that knowes not what to say. This worlds vile Grammer hath a wicked speach: Where Wealth and Will doe carry such a sway That many a time the Goodwife weares the breech, And the stowte Oke must yeelde vnto the Beech. Such vile coniunctions such constructions make, That some are pois'ned with a Sugar Cake. Terence his Plaies are too much in request. The Knaue, the Foole, the Swagg'rer, and the Whore, Thraso and Gnato, Lais and the rest Of all the crue (that I dare say no more; But ware the dogges that keepe the Diuels dore) So play their parts vpon the worldly Stage, That theiues are hangd before they come to age. Oh tis a word to heare a Gander keake, And all the Geese to giue a hisse to heere; To heare an Owle to teach a Parrat speake, While Cuckoes notes makes better Musique deere; Where nere a better singing bird is neere, Would it not grieue a good Musitians eare To be enforst to stand attentiue heare. To see a Wise man handled like a Foole An Asse exalted like a proper man: To see a Puddle honour'd like a Poole, An old blinde Goose swimme wagers with a Swan, Or Siluer Cuppes disgracèd by a Canne: Who wold not grieue that so the world should go? But who can helpe it, if it will be so? No, no, alas it is in vaine for mee, To helpe the eyes, that ioy not in the light: Hee that is sworne that hee will neuer see, Let him play Buzzard, with his blinded sight. An Owle will neuer haue an Eagles flight; Hee, that is once conceited of his Wit, Must die of folly: ther's no helpe for it. And yet good Fooles, that cannot doe withall, May well be borne with, for their simple Wits: And Knauish Wits, that wicked Fooles wee call, (Where Hellish Sathan with his Angels sits, To worke the feates of many a thousand fits) Those foolish knaues, or knauish fooles I meane, I would to God, the world were ridde of cleane. And yet is it in vaine such world to wish: There is no packe of Cardes without a Knaue: Who loues to feede vpon a Sallet dish, Among his Herbes some wicked weede may haue: Some men must winne, some lose, and some must saue. Fooles wil be Fooles, doe wise men what they can, And may a Knaue, deceiue an honest man. A Curtall Iade will shewe his hackney trickes And snarling Curres will bite a man behinde: The Blacke Thorne Shrubbe is best knowne by his Prickes: A Kestrell can not chuse but shewe her kinde. Wise men sometime must wait, till Fooles haue din'd: And yet, those Fooles, in common Wits conceite, Are Wise, when Wisdom on their wealth doth wait. And yet the wealthy Foole is but a Foole, The Knaue with all his wealth is but a Knaue: For truest Wisdome reades in Vertues schoole, That there is no man happy till his graue. The Hermit liues more quiet in his Caue, Then many a King that long vsurpes a Crowne; That in the end comes headlong t?bling downe. Yet who so base, as would not be a King? And who so fond as thinkes not hee is Wise? Doth not the Cuckoe thinke that shee can sing, As clearely as a Birde of Paradise? The fowlest Dowd' is faire in her owne eyes. Conceipt is strong and hath such kinde of vaine, As workes strange wonders in a Woodcocks brain. But, what should Fancy dwell vpon a Fable? In some farre Contries, Women ride a-stride: The Foole that in the kinde can vse his bable, Shall haue Fat meate and somewhat els beside. For Wit doth wonders vnder folly hide: Yet in true Wisdome, all are Fooles approued, They that loue Fooles, and Fooles that are beloued. But since tis best that all agree in one, The prouerbe saies, tis mery when friends meete. It is a kinde of death to liue alone. A louing humour is a pleasing sweete. Let Wise men studie on the Winding sheete, And weaker Wits this poore contentment haue, Tis better be a Foole then be a Knaue. And so, good friend, if so thou be, farewell: I must not stand vpon the Foole too long; Least that my spirits so with folly swell, As doe perhaps my better humours wrong: And therefore thus in briefe I ende my song, The wisest man hath writ, that euer was, Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia vanitas. Vanitie all, all is but vanitie, Nothing on earth but that will haue an end: Where hee that trustes to bare Humanitie, Shall hardly liue to finde in Heauen a friend. Take heede therefore the Highest to offend: Either learne Wit, where truest Wisdome lies, Or take my word, thou neuer wilt be Wise. And therefore let the wise not be displeas'd If they be counted Fonde as well as other: For, tis a plague that hath the world diseas'd, Since sinne became vnhappie Natures Mother: And let me say but this, my gentle brother; Since all is vaine, that liues vnder the Sunne, Good wise men beare with Fooles, and I haue done.

To my very louing and vndeserued good friend M GRIFFIN PEN, vpon his heart's true worthinesse shine the Sunne of highest happinesse. PASQVILS Passe. He that desires from danger safe to passe Along the world, his wofull wretched daies, And would behold (as in a looking glasse) The blocks and stops, and such vnhappy staies, As crosse a thousand in their very waies: Let him but creepe as I haue learnd to go, And tell me if it do him good or no. He that will passe neere to a Princes Court, Let him take heede his tongue breake not his necke; Nor mate himselfe among the Noble sort, Lest prowde presumption haue too sore a checke, Nor bend his will, to euery wanton's becke: But watch good fortunes, when they kindly fall, And then passe on, and haue no feare at all. But, if a face of brasse will be too bold, Or like a sheepes head shunne good company, Or of complexion be too chilling cold, Or fiery hot vpon an agony, Or much inclined to any villany, Or for his wit, ioyne issue with an asse, He hath no warrant neere the Court to passe. He that will passe before a Iudgement seate, Let him take heede his case be good and cleere, Lest, when that Trueth doth of the matter treate A heedlesse will do buy repentance deere: While cost ill lost doth breed but heauy cheere: But let him chiefly carry a good purse, And then be sure to passe on ne're the worse. But, if he come with an vncertainety, And thinke a curtsie will excuse a fee, In hope that Law in Pitties charity, Wil alwayes giue the right where it should be, Let him learne this probatum rule of me, That Trueth and Wealth do very much in law, While beggar Falshoode is not worth a straw. He that wil passe into a warlike field, Let him not be too rash, nor yet too slow, Not franticke fight, nor like a coward yeeld, But with discretion so his valour show, That fame may grace him where e're he goe: Lest heedlesse will do shew when he is slaine, He may passe hither, but not backe againe. He that will passe into a Merchants booke, Let him take heede how to discharge the debt, Lest when that Kindnesse doth for Patience looke. He be so tangled in a Statute net, That he be so with cunning trickes beset That to the Counter he do passe so fast, As he can scarce passe backe againe in haste. He that wil passe into a Ladies eies, And in her hands wil leaue his little heart, And yet with all his wit, is not so wise, As to discerne the sleight of Venus Art; In giuing of the Fooles-Cap by desart: Let him go better set his wittes to schoole, Or else be sure to passe for a good foole. He that will passe into the Holy land, Let him be grounded in the rules of grace, And be assurde that he doth vnderstand, What is the trueth that falshoode may deface; Lest when that Wisedome Follie doth displace And Learnings Court breake vp, and all are gone, He passe but for a simple blind sir Ihon. He that will passe into a Clownes conceit, Let him take heede he know a clouted shooe, Lest him be cousoned with a close deceit: When seely Fooles know not what Knaues can doe, With, Yea, and Nay, to bring an Ideot to: But if he kindly know Clim of the Clough, Then let him passe, he shall doe well enough. He that will passe into an Ordinary, Let him take heede to deale with cardes and dice; Lest whatsoeuer mony in he carry, Ere he beware he loose it with a trice, And, all too late repentance, learne the price, To know how he that passeth in purse-full, And goes out empty, passeth for a Gull. He that desires to passe vnto the seas, Let him take heede his ship be good and tight, Let him prouide for all things for his ease, And to withstand both wind and weathers spight, And by his Compas keepe his course aright: Be wary of the shelfes, the rocks, and sands, And fall not rashly into pyrats hands. But if he passe within a leaking ship, Ill victualld, and worse furnisht for defence, And thinke a thousand leagues is but a skip, And by the want of wits experience, Prouide for nothing that may shunne offence: Such one may happen well to passe from shore, But once at sea may passe to lande no more. But he that seekes to passe by sea or land, To Court, or Country, for his best auaile, Let him thus much for certaine vnderstand, That if his purse the better not preuaile, His fortune will in many courses faile: For a good purse will make a man to passe To many places where he neuer was. But if (alas) he be passe purse pennilesse, In this vile world he shall haue little grace, But with a heauy heart all comfortlesse, Among the Beggars take a sory place: Oh this same Gold hath such a glorious face, That in false Angells, he that heedes not well, Will headlong passe his wicked soule to hell. But, he that faine would passe to Paradise. Must learne to passe from all these worldly pleasures; For vnto heau'n what heart can passe his eies, That is intangled in this worlds treasure? No, where the World hath on the Soule made seisure, As hardly it can passe to heau'n on hie, As can a Camell through a Needles eie. Then do not passe the boundes of honestie, Of wit, of reason, nor of amitie, Of law, of iustice, nor of equitie, Nor the true grounds of Trueths diuinitie; But in the worship of the Trinitie, Humble thy soule vnto the Deitie, And passe vnto heau'ns felicitie.

A fleering laughter, and a faithlesse heart, A creeping curtsie, and a cankred mind, An idle study, and a needlesse art, A Northerne tempest, and an Easterne wind, And from a Curre, that bites a man behind, And from a glasse of an il-fauour'd blee: The Lord of heau'n and earth deliuer me. To keepe too long among vngodly people, To fit mine humor vnto euery fashion, To seeke to build a house vpon Paules Steeple, To dwell too long vpon a peeuish fashion, To follow ill, and hate a reformation, To learne the rules where such ill lessons be: From all such trifles, the Lord deliuer me. To make an idoll of a painted face, And to attend vpon a golden asse, To seeke to do the honest mind disgrace And bring a kind of wicked world to passe, Or seeke to braue it with a face of brasse, To leape the Tems, or clime a rotten tree: From all such trifles, the Lord deliuer me.

From laying plottes for to abuse a friend, From being by a cunning knaue beguild, From working humors to a wicked end, From getting of a filthy whore with child, From dwelling in a house that is vntilde, From surfeting within a cherrie tree: From all such toies, good Lord deliuer me. From a conspiracie of wicked knaues, A flight of buzzards, and a denne of theeues, A knot of villaines, and a crue of slaues, And from the patches on the beggars sleeues, And from the spoile that gratious spirits greeues, And from the foole can neither thriue nor thee: The blessed Lord of heau'n deliuer me.

From the forsaking of the word of God, To follow idle humour'd fopperies, To scorne the scourging of the heau'nly rod, From doing of my selfe such iniuries, To bring my soule into such miseries, And from all sinne within my soule to see; The gratious God of heau'n deliuer me. When I am olde, and sicke, and lame and poore, And crucified a thousand sundry wayes, And death beginnes to ope my fatall doore, To call me home from my vnhappy dayes, And all my passions then must end their playes. Then from all euill, and both now and then: The Lord of heau'n deliuer me, Amen. PASQVILS Prognostication. When that a churle doth grow so prodigal, He cares not how he throw away his coyne, And a wise man growes so fantasticall, As with a foole will for his counsell ioyne, And that a Fencer layes away his foyne, And a yong spend-thrift falles to purchase land: I feare that Doomes day will be hard at hand. When that a Lawyer leaues to take a fee, And that a trades man will not sell for gaine, When euery Iudge will so indifferent be, Euen as he sees to shew the matter plaine, When that the world is growne to such a vaine: My muse doth feare in her best ayming markes, The skie will fall, and then we shall haue Larkes. When humblenesse is praisde, and pride abated, Vertue is honourd, and foule vice defaced, Goodnesse beloued, wickednesse is hated, Wisedome aduanced, folly is displaced, Truth is esteem'd and falshood is disgraced, The rich men giue their treasure to the poore: I feare me Doomes day will be at the doore. When filthy Dowdes will leaue to paint their faces, And Iacke an Apes leaue ietting like a man, And Brokers debters feare no Sergeants maces Nor Geese will take the riuer with the Swan, Nor greedie turne-spittes licke the dripping pan, Nor that a knaue will giue a foole the scoffe: I feare me doomes day will be not farre off. When giddie heads lay by their idle humors, And wicked wittes will leaue their villanie, And gracelesse tongues will cease vnciuill Rumors, And yong men follow no il companie, Nor maides be sicke of the sweete Timpanie, But constant hearts for very loue will die: I feare me doomes day will be then too nie. When idle louers leaue for to dissemble, And faithfull friends are worthily regarded, And Vertue's beautie doth the sunne resemble, While clowdie mistes are vtterly disswaded, And carefull seruice kindly is rewarded, While honor liues, where loue can neuer die: I feare me doomes day will be very nigh. When old men liue til they be yong againe, And yong men fal in age before their time, When Poets Muses leaue to frump and faine, And blossomes loose the beautie of their prime, And no man falls that takes in hand to clime, And he that may be rich will needes be poore: I feare me Doomes day then is at the doore. When that a beggar braues it with a King, And that a coward puts a souldier downe, And that a Waspe is bred without a sting, And that a Knight must creepe vnto a Clowne, And heart sicke Honor falls into a swowne, And careful hearts for lacke of comfort die: I feare me doomes day wil be then too nie. When cankred coine a Kingdom may command, And many thousands die for one mans ease, And that a poore man may not right demand, And honest hearts must wicked humors please, Til sorrow too much on the soule do ceaze: When thus the world with woe is ouergone, I feare that Doomes day will be coming on. When Cockes of game begin to leaue their fight, And old fooles will not with yong bables play, The stately Eagle loose her lofty height, And wise men fall to keepe fooles holiday. When that the world doth grow to such a stay, It makes me feare that much about that yeere, The day of Doome wil sure be very neere. When that the Lion doth begin to roare, The wolfe to houle, the snarling curre to barke, The buzzard Kite too neere the Sunne to soare, The Bunting striue to mount aboue the Larke: My Muse doth find in her best aiming marke, That neere vpon that yeare she feares to see, The comming of the day of Doome wil be. When that a flie vpon a galde horse backe, Can make fooles laugh to see how he can sit, And when a pedler in a beggars packe, Can carrie ware, for his poore trade vnfit, And with his purse can go away with it, And Epicures will leaue their belly-cheere: I feare me then the day of Doome is neere. When Iohn a Noddes will be a Gentleman Because his worship weares a velvet coate, And euery Piper, a Musitian, Because he hits vpon an idle noate, And Beggars care not for the King a groate, When that the foole will giue himselfe the scoffe: I feare me Doomes day cannot be farre off. When children teach their parents how to speake, And seruants learne their masters to command, When strong men will be guided by the weake, And Rascall driue the male Deere downe the lawnde, And Beggars fill the misers emptie Mawnd, And dead men rise aliue out of the Beere: I feare me Doomes day wil be very neere. When conies hunt the dogges out of the warren, And partridges beate hawkes out of the field, And deinty faulcons feede on filthy carren, And souldiers take the penne, and leaue the field, And that a prince will to his subiects yeeld: Then by some rules my Muse doth vnderstand, She biddes me feare that doomes day is at hand. When such as loue their eies will needes be blind, And such as heare will seeme to stoppe their eares, And fathers to their children are vnkind, Because they thinke that they are none of theirs, When they haue wiues, and other make their heires: When such hard pointes the world doth stand vpon, I feare me doomes day will be comming on. When that the world is set vpon a will, And purses carie matters as they list, When all the grace is in the golden skill, And few or none that cares for had I wist, And each one thinkes he walketh in a mist: When all these courses fall out in a yeere, I feare me Doomes day will be very neere. When idle quarrels breede vngodly warres, And subtil peace deceiues a simple heart, When men do shoote their arrowes at the starres And neuer thinke of death his sodaine dart: When thus the world doth take the foolish part, When all good thoughts are flung vpon the floore, I feare me Doomes day will be at the doore. When he that puts himselfe into good ragges, Thinkes himselfe halfe a prince for his apparrell, When he that hath the chest of golden bagges Beleeues he hath the world within a barrell: When folly thus with better wit will quarrell While wisedome in the world hath much disgrace, I feare me Doomes day will come on apace. When lands and bagges do marry wealth to wealth, And want and vertue must go downe the wind, When few or none regard the spirites health, While wicked humors leade away the mind: When the poore world is in this pitteous kind, While hellish spirits in their pride do stand, I feare me Doomes day will be hard at hand. When Charing crosse and Paules do meete, And breake their fast in Friday streete, And Ware and Waltam go to Kent, To purchase lands and gather rent, And Easter falles afore the Lent: Then if my Table doe not lie, The day of doome will sure be nie. When woodcockes build in dawcockes nestes, And Robin Hood is rise againe, And misers churles make merry feasts, And merchants loose that they may gaine: When once the world is in that vaine, Then do not thinke but nigh that yeere, The day of doome is very neere. When euery child his father knowes, And euery man will loue his wife, And women sweare to be no shrowes, But husbands leade a quiet life, While kindnesse cuts off euery strife: Then without doubt this build vpon, The day of doome is comming on. When Newgate is without a knaue, And Bridewell found without a whoore, A galley found without a slaue, A Farmers barne without a floore, And not a beggar at the doore: Then let both time and reson trie, And if that doomes day be not nie. When theeues begin to leaue to steale, And Iades will leaue their kicking trickes, And fooles their secrets will conceale, And maides will vse no setting stickes, Nor blacke thorne carrie pointed prickes: Then do not thinke but in that yeere, The day of doome will sure be neere. When old men care not for their health, And faire yong women wish to die, And rich men throw away their wealth, And Rascalls leaue their beggarie, And Knaues will leaue their knauerie: Then thinke as I haue said before, The day of Doome is at the doore. When wanton eies breede wicked minds, And wilfull heads breede wofull hearts, While indiscretion nature blinds, To scorne the rules of Reasons Artes, And headlong fall into foule partes, Til had-I-wist make folly crie: Then thinke the day of Doome is nie. When women will no malice shew And men are free from envies fault, Who may be high, wil be below, And beefe keepe sweete that hath no salt, And Beere is brewed with musty Malt: Then do beleeue that truth will trie, The day of Doome will sure be nie. When Gamsters at Primero rests, Will put out all their purses eie, And warres do grow to be but iests, Where many fight, and few do die, A spider will not eate a flie: Then by my rule I vnderstand, The day of Doome will be at hand. When Souldiers led into a field, Do see their leaders runne at a stay, The valiant to the coward yeeld, That doth his honour steale away: When the world is at such a fray, I say but as I said before, Thinke Doomes day will be at the doore. When that a Cocke wil craue his hen, Because shee is not of his breede, And boies will be as good as men, When schollers teach their Masters reade, An hearb is spoilèd by a weede: Then by my rules experience, That day of Doome is not farre hence. When no good nature can amend ill manners, Nor daily preaching draw the world to God, But sinne and shame display their open banners, While he on earth begins to make abode, When holy thoughts are wholy ouertrode, While faith and troth do feare to shew their face: I feare me Doomes day will come on apace. When that a man must seeke to please his wife, For feare the cuckoe sing vpon his head, A women will be wearie of her life, Because she cannot bring a foole to bed, When siluer thus must be exchangde for led: By such true rules as I haue rightly scand, I feare me Doomes day will be hard at hand, When wicked minds will in their humors dwell, And sinne is not ashamde to shew her face, And Atheists are resolude to go to hell, Because they haue no feeling thought of Grace: When that the world is in this wofull case, And death and sorrow do begin their song, I feare the day of Doome will not be long. When men and women gree like dogges and cats, Because the world is full of wicked natures, And euery towne is full of mice and rattes, That do deuoure the foode of better creatures, While fooles make idolls of ill-fauoured features: When we are thus poore, people to beg on vs, I feare me doomes day will come stealing on vs. When that a cat will eate no milke, And that a fox the goose forsakes, And courtiers leaue their wearing silke, And snow doth leaue to fall in flakes, And one man marres that other makes: Then doth my Table say that yeere, The day of Doome will sure be neere. When fishes leaue to play with baites, And buzzards leaue to beate the wind, And knaues will leaue with cunning sleights, For to deceiue a simple mind: When that the world is in this kind, Be sure this note to build vpon, The day of Doome is comming on. When morrice dancers leaue their bells, The foole his bable by will lay, And oisters breede without their shells, And that the mice with cattes will play, While wise men make fooles holy day: Then tell me if my table lie, That saies that doomes day will be nie. When that a Kite the Chicken feares, The wolfe will not come neere the Lamb, The frogs will be as big as Beares, The Ewe will not abide the Ramme, A Calfe wil leaue to sucke the Damme: Then do I by my table find, That doomes day is not farre behind. When youth will not the wantons play, And age hath sworne he will not dote, And wil and wit are at a fray, While beggarie is not worth a groate: It is a certaine rule to note, That very much upon that yeere, The day of doome approcheth neere. When that a beggar braues a King, And fishes swimme without their finnes, An Owle wil teach a Larke to sing, And fishers leaue to lay their ginnes, When puddings creepe out of their skinnes: Then thinke as I haue said before, The day of doome is at the doore. When Swallowes leaue to feede on Flies, And Asses looke into the ayre, And Mowles begin to ope their eies, And two fooles do not make a paire, And Basenesse sits in Honors chaire, And the Lord be seruant to a Groome: Then thinke vpon the day of doome. When fire begins to leaue his heate, No coolenesse in the water is, The hungry will refuse their meate, And louers leaue to coll and kisse, And all is well that was amisse: Then doth my perfect rule descrie, The day of doome wil sure be nigh. When couetousnesse can infect a King, And pride is set vpon a beggars heart, And too much want the honest mind doth wring, While helplesse sorrow breedes the spirits smart: When thus the diuell ginnes to play his part, To fill the world with such unhappy fare, I feare doomes day before we be aware. When furies flie like sparkles in the ayre, With fire and sword, to fil the world with bloud, And feareful soules are neere vnto despaire, While gracelesse hearts can see no hope of good, But endlesse sorrow is the sinners food: When thus the diuell in the world doth sit, Doomes day wil come, although it be not yet.

      <field name="fulltext">MELANCHOLIKE HUMOURS, In Verses of Diverse Natures, Set downe by NICH: BRETON, Gent. To the Lover of good studies, and Fauourer of good actions, MASTER THOMAS BLUNT, Heavens blessing, and earths happinesse. In Authorem. Thov, that wouldst finde the habit of true passion, And see a minde attir'd in perfect straines; No twearing moodes, as gallants doe a fashion, In these pide times, only to shewe their braines, Looke here on Bretons Worke, the master print: Where, such perfections to the life doe rise; If they seeme wry, to such as looke asquint, The fault's not in the object, but their eyes. For, as one comming with a laterall viewe Vnto a cunning piece wrought perspectiue, Wants facultie to make a censure true; So with this Authors readers will it thriue: Which, being eyed directly, I diuine His proofe their praise, will meet, as in this line. Ben: Iohnson. See and Say Nothing. Oh my thoughts, keepe in your words, Least their passage do repent yee; Knowing, Fortune still affordes Nothing, but may discontent yee. If your saint be like the sunne, Sit not yee in Phœbus chaire, Least, when once the horses runne, Yee be Dedalus his heire. If your labours well deserue, Let your silence onely grace them; And in patience hope preserue, That no fortune can deface them. If your friend doe growe vnkinde, Grieue, but doe not seeme to showe it: For a patient heart shall finde Comfort, when the soule shall know it. If your trust be all betrai'd, Trie, but trust no more at all: But in soule be not dismai'd; Whatsoeuer doe befall. In your selues your selues enclose, Keepe your secrecies vnseene; Least when ye your selues disclose, Yee had better neuer beene. And what euer be your state, Doe not languish ouerlong; Least you finde it, all too late, Sorrow be a deadly song. And be comforted in this, If your passions be concealed, Crosse or comfort, bale or blisse, 'Tis the best, is not reuealed. So, my deerest thoughts, adieu, Hark whereto my soule doth call yee: Be but secret, wise, and true, Feare no euill can befall yee. What is Hell? What is the place that some do paint for Hell? A lake of horrour for the life of man: Is it not then the death wherein I dwell, That knowes no joy, since first my life began? What are the diuils? Spirits of tormenting; What else are they, that vexe me in each vaine? With wretched thoughts my wofull spirit tempting, Or else perplex mee in an after-paine. What is the fire? but, an effect of sinne, That keepes my heart in an vnkindly heat. How long shall I this life continue in? Till true repentance mercy doe entreate, And Patience cry, euen at the latest breath, Saue mee, sweet Lord yet fr? the sec?d death. Mal Content. If I desir'd vnto the world to liue, Or sought in soule to serue the golden God: If I did homage to an idole giue, Or, with the wicked wisht to haue abode, Then, well might Justice lay her sword vpon mee, In due correction of my crooked hart; But shall I liue, in soule thus woe begon mee, That seeke in faith to serue the better part? Ah, wretched Soule, why dost thou murmur so? It is thy crosse, and thou art borne to beare it: Through hellish griefs thy hart to heav? must go, For Patience crowne, if thou wilt liue to wear it. Then rest with this, (since Faith is Virtues friend,) Death ends distresse, Heauen makes a happy end. A Dolefull Passion. Oh, tyred heart too full of sorrowes, In night-like daies, despairing morrowes; How canst thou thinke, so deepely greeued, To hope to liue to be relieued? Good Fortune hath all grace forsworne thee, And cruell Care hath too much torne thee: Vnfaithfull friends do all deceiue thee; Acquaintance all vnkindly leaue thee. Beauty, out of her booke doth blot thee, And Loue hath vtterly forgot thee: Patience doth but to passion moue thee, While only Honour liues to loue thee. Thine enemies all ill deuise thee, Thy friends but little good aduise thee; And they who most doe duety owe thee, Doe seeme as though they doe not knowe thee. Thus Pittie weepes to looke vpon thee, To see how thou art woe begon thee; And while these passions seeke to spill thee, Death but attends the houre to kill thee. And since no thoughte is comming to thee, That any way may comfort doe thee; Dispose thy thoughtes as best may please thee, That Heauen, of all thy Hell, may ease thee. A Testament vpon the Passion. To Care, that crucifies my heart, My sighes and sobbes I doe bequeath; And to my Sorrowes deepest smart, The latest gaspe that I doe breath. To Fortune, I bequeath my folly, To giue to such as seeke her grace: To faithlesse friends, that fortune wholly, That brought mee in this heavie case. To Beauty, I bequeath mine age; To Love, the hate of wit and sense; To Patience, but the cure of rage; To Honour, Virtues patience. Mine enemies I do forgiue; And to my friends I giue my loue; And wish vngrateful hearts may liue But like ingratitude to proue. To Pitty, I bequeath my teares, To fill her eyes when they be dry; To Faith, the fearelesse thoughts of feares, To giue to life, to let me die. My care I doe bequeath to Death, To cut the threades that thoughts do spinne; And at my latest gasp of breath, To Heauen my soule, to Hell my sinne. A Fantasticke Solemne Humour. Sovnd, good Reason, sound my sorrowes, Equall them with any liuing; Finde the worst of all her giuing, When she most her mischiefe borrowes. Leaue not patience all perplexed, Where no passions are appeased; But her torments, never eased, Keepe her spirit too much vexed. Tell, oh tell the truest story That hath long time bene described; Whereto justly is ascribed Sorrowes pride, and Death his glory. Loue bred in Discretions blindnesse, Shadowes, for the sunne affecting Nothing, but nothing effecting, Shewes the crosse of Natures kindnesse. Wit, bewitcht with wanton Beauty, Lost the raines of Reasons bridle; And, in Folly all too idle, Brake the bands of Reasons duty. Time misspent in Follies trifles, (With repentance sorrow feeding,) In the rules of Reasons reeding, Findes them nothing else but nifles. Care, yet seeking to recouer Indiscretions heavie losses, Found, in casting vp my crosses, Sorrow only left the louer. A Briefe of Sorrowe. Mvse of sadnesse neere Deaths fashion, Too neere madnesse, write my passion; Paines possesse mee, Sorrowes spill mee, Cares distresse mee, all would kill mee; Hopes haue faild mee, Fortune foild mee, Feares haue quaild mee, all haue spoild mee: Woes haue worne mee, sighes haue soakt mee; Thoughts haue torne mee, all haue broke mee. Beauty strooke me, Loue hath catcht mee, Death hath tooke mee, all dispatcht mee. A Solemne Fancy. Sorrow in my heart breedeth A cocatrices neast, Where euery young bird feedeth Vpon my Hearts vnrest. Where euery pecke they giue mee, (Which euery houre they doe,) Vnto such paine they driue mee, I knowe not what to doe. Oh, broode vnhapp'ly hatched Of such a cursed kinde, Where Death and Sorrowe matched, Liue, but to kill the minde. Wordes torments are but trifles, That but conceits confounde; And Natures griefes but nifles Vnto the Spirits wounde. They are but Cares good morrowes That passions can declare; While my Hearts inward sorrowes Are all without compare. Fortune, she seekes to sweare mee To all may discontent mee; Yet sayes, she doth forbeare mee, She doth no more torment mee. Beauty she doth retaine mee In scarce a fauours tittle; And though she doe disdeigne mee, She thinkes my griefe too little. Loue falles into a laughing At Reasons little good, While Sorrow, with her quaffing, Is drunke with my heart blood. But let her drinke and spare not, Vntill my heart be dry; And let Love laugh, I care not; My hope is, I shall dy. And Death shall only tell My froward fortunes fashion, That nearest vnto hell Was found the Lovers passion. A Solemne Sonnet. Fortvne hath writ characters on my heart As full of crosses as the skinne can holde, Which tell of torments, tearing euery part, While Death and Sorrowe do my fate vnfolde. Patience sits leaning like a pining soule, That had no heart to thinke of Hopes reliefe; While fruitlesse cares discomfort doe enroule Within the ground of neuer ending griefe. Thoughts flie about, as all in feare confounded; Reason growne mad, with too much mal content; Loue, passion-rent, to see his patience wounded, With dreadfull terrors of Despaires intent. While Care concludes, in comforts overthrowne, Wh? Death can speak, my passi?s shal be showne. An Extreame Passion. Ovt of the depth of deadly griefe, tormenting day and night; A wounded heart and wretched soule depriu'd of all delight; Where neuer thought of comfort came, that passi? might appease; Or by the smallest sparke of hope might giue the smallest ease: Let me intreat that solemne Muse that serues but Sorrowes turne, In ceasselesse sighes and endlesse sobs to helpe my soule to mourne. But, Oh what thought bey?d al thought hath thought to think vpon, Where Patience findes her greatest power in passions ouergon. That neere the doore of Natures death in dolefull notes doth dwell; In Horrors fits that will describe my too much figur'd hell. What want, what wrong, what care, what crosse, may crucifie a hart; But day and howre I doe endure in all and euery part? Want to sustaine the Bodies neede, wrong to distract the minde: Where Want makes Wit and Reason both to goe against their kinde. Care to deuise for Comforts helpe; but so by Fortune crost, As kils the heart, to cast the eye on nought but labour lost. Desire to liue, in spite of Death, yet still in liuing dying; And so a greater death than death, by want of dying, trying. Oh, hell of hels, if euer earth such horror can afford, Where such a world of helpelesse cares doe lay the heart aboord. No day, no night, no thought, no dreame, but of that doleful nature, That may amaze, or sore affright, a most afflicted creature. Friends turnd to foes, foes vse their force; and Fortune in her pride, Shaks hand with Fate, to make my soule the weight of sorrow bide, Care brings in sicknes, sicknes pain, and paine with patience passion, With biting in most bitter griefes brings feature out of fashion; Where brawn falne cheeks, heart scalding sighs, and dimmèd eyes with teares Doe shewe, in Lifes anatomy, what burthen Sorrowe beares. Where all day long in helplesse cares, all hopelesse of reliefe, I wish for night, I might not see the objectes of my griefe. And when night comes, woes keep my wits in such a waking vaine, That I could wish, though to my griefe, that it were day againe. Thus daies are nights, which nights are daies, which daies are like those nights, That to my passi?s s?se pres?t but only Sorrows sights; Which to the eye but of the minde of Misery appeare, To fill the heart of forlorne Hope too full of heauie cheare. Oh hart how canst thou hold so long, and art not broke ere this? When all thy strings are but the straines that c?fort strikes amisse. Yet must thou make thy musicke still but of that mournfull straine, Where Sorrowe, in the sound of death, doth shew her sweetest vain: Or where her Muses all consent in their consort to trie Their sweetest musicke, in desire to die, and cannot die. The pellican that kils her selfe, her young ones for to feede, Is pleas'd to dy that they may liue, that suck when she doth bleede: But while I in those cares consume that would my spirit kill, Nought liues by me, when I must die, to feede but Sorrowes will. The hart that's h?ted all day long, hath sport yet with the ho?ds, And happly beats off many a dogge before his deadly wounds: But my poore heart is hunted still with such a cruell cry, As in their dogged humours liue, while I alone must die. The swan that sings before her death, doth shew that she is pleas'd, To knowe that death will not be long in helping the diseas'd: But my poore swanlike soule, (alas) hath no such power to sing; Because she knowes not when my death will make my care a king. What shall I say? but only say; I knowe not what to say: So many torments teare my heart, and tugge it euery way. My sunne is turnd into a shade, or else mine eyes are blinde, That Sorrowes cloude makes all seeme darke, that comes into my minde. My youth to age; or else because my comforts are so colde, My sorrowe makes me in conceit to be decrepit olde. My hopes to feares; or else because my fortunes are forlorne, My fancie makes me make my selfe vnto my selfe vnto my selfe a scorne. My life to death; or else because my heart is so perplexed, I finde my selfe but liuing dead, to feele my soule so vexed. For what is here that earth can yeeld in Pleasures sweetest vaine, But in the midst of all my cares doth still increase my paine? While epicures are overglut, I ly, and starue for foode; Because my conscience can not thriue vpon ill gotten good. While other swimme in choyce of silkes, I sit alone in ragges; Because I can not fitte the time to fill the golden bagges. While other are bedeckt in golde, in pearle, and pretious stone; I sigh to see they haue so much, and I can light of none. Not that I enuie their estate, but wish that God would giue Some comfort to my carefull hope, wherby my heart might liue. Some please themselves in choyce of sports, in trifles and in toies; While my poore feeble spirit feedes of nothing but annoyes. Some haue their houses stately built, and gorgeous to beholde; While in a cottage, bare and poore, I bide the bitter colde. Some haue their chariots and their horse, to beare them to and fro; While I am glad to walke on foote, and glad I can doe so. Some haue their musickes hermony, to please their idle eares; While of the song of sorrow still my soule the burthen beares. Some haue their choice of all perfumes, that Natures arte can giue; While sinne doth stinke so in my soule, as makes me loath to liue. They, like the wielders of the world, command, and haue their will; While I, a weakling in the world, am slaue to sorrow still. The owle, that makes the night her day, delights yet in the darke; But I am forc't to play the owle, that haue beene bred a larke. The eagle from the lowest vale can mount the lofty skie; But I am falne downe from the hill, and in the vale must die. The sparrow in a princes house can finde a place to builde; I scarce can finde out any place that will my comfort yeelde. The little wrenne doth find a worme, the little finch a seede; While my poore heart doth hunger still, and finds but little feede. The bee doth find her hony flower, the butterflie her leafe; But I can finde a worlde of corne, that yeeldes not me a sheafe. The horse, the oxe, the silly asse, that tugge out all the day, At night come home, and take their rest, and lay their worke away: While my poore heart, both day and night, in passions ouertoild; By ouerlabour of my braine doth finde my spirit spoiled. The winds doe blowe away the clowds, that would obscure the sun; And how all glorious is the sky, when once the stormes are done! But in the heav? of my harts hope, where my loves light doth shine; I nothing see, but clouds of cares, or else my sunne decline. The earth is watred, smooth'd and drest, to keepe her gardens gay; While my poore heart, in woefull thoughtes, must wither still away. The sea is sometime at a calme, where shippes at anchor ride; And fishes, on the sunny shore, doe play on euery side: But my poore heart in Sorrows seas, is sicke of such a qualme; As, while these stormy tempests holde, can neuer looke for calme. So that I see, each bird and beast, the sea, the earth, the sky, All sometime in their pleasures liue, while I alone must die. Now thinke, if all this be too true, (as would it were not so) If any creature liue on earth, that doe like sorrow knowe. Nay, aske of Sorrow, euen her selfe, to thinke how I am wounded, If she be not, to see my woes, within her selfe confounded: Or say, no figure can suffice my sorrowes frame to fashion, Where Pati?ce thus hath shew'd her selfe, bey?d her selfe in passion. Par nulla figura dolori, nec dolor meo. A Solemne Farewell to the World. Oh forlorne Fancy whereto dost thou liue, To weary out the senses with vnrest? Hopes are but cares, that but discomforts giue, While only fooles doe clime the phoenix nest: To heart sicke soules all joyes are but a jest, Thou dost in vain but striue against the streame, With blinded eyes to see the sunny beame. Die with desire, abandoned from delight, Thy weary winter lasteth all the yeare: Say to thy selfe that darknesse is the light, Wherein doth nothing but thy death appeare; While wit and sense, in Sorrowes heauy cheare, Findes thee an humour, but vnkindly bredde Of Hopes illusions, in too weake a head. Fortune affrightes thee with a thousand feares, While Folly feedes thee with abuse of wit; And while thy force in fainting passion weares, Patience is ready to increase the fit, Where agonies in their extreames doe sit: So that, each way, thy soule is so perplexed, As better die, then liue to be so vexed. Say, Patience somewhat doe asswage thy paine; Prolonged cures are too vncomfortable; And where that care doth neuer comfort gaine, The state, alasse must needes be miserable: Where Sorrowes labours are so lamentable, That Silence saies, that to the soule complains, Concealèd sorrowes are the killing pains. Then doe not ceasse to sigh and sobbe thy fill, Bleede in the teares of true loue's liuing blood; Shewe how vnkindnesse seekes the heart to kill, That hides a buzzard in a falcons hoode: Feede not thy self with misconceipted good; Better to starue, then in a sugred pill To taste the poison of the Spirits ill. But if thou canst content thee with thy life, And wilt endure a double death to liue, If thou canst beare that bitter kinde of strife, Where crosse conceipts but discontents do giue: If to this ende thou canst thine humour driue, And cares true patience can command thee so; Give me then leave to tell thee what I knowe. I knowe too well, that all too long haue tryed, That earth containeth not that may content thee; Sorrowe will so beset thee on each side, That Wit nor Reason can the thought inuent thee, But that will some way serue for to torment thee: Hope wil deceiue thee, Happinesse goe by thee, Fortune will faile thee, and the World defie thee. Beauty will blinde thine eyes, bewitch thine heart, Confound thy senses, and commaund thy will, Scorne thy desire, not looke on thy desart, Disdaine thy seruice, quite thy good with ill, And make no care thy very soule to kill. Time will outgoe thee, Sorrowe overtake thee, And Death, a shadow of a substance, make thee. I know this world will neuer be for thee; Conscience must carry thee another way: Another world must be for thee and mee, Where happie thoughts must make their holiday, While heauenly comforts neuer will decay. We must not thinke in this ill age to thriue, Where Faith and Loue are scarcely found aliue. Wee must not build our houses on the sands, Where euery flood will wash them quite away; Nor set our seales vnto those wicked bands, Where damnèd soules their debts in hel must pay: Our states must stand vpon a better stay; Vpon the rock we must our houses builde, That wil our frames from winde and water shield. Goe, bid the world, with all his trash, farewell, And tell the earth it shall be all but dust: These wicked wares, that worldlings buy and sell, The moath will eat, or else the canker rust: All flesh is grasse, and to the graue it must. This sinke of sin is but the way to hell; Leaue it, I say, and bid the world farewell. Account of pompe but as a shadowed power, And thinke of friends but as the sommer flies; Esteeme of beauty as a fading flower, And louers fancies but as fabled lies: Knowe, that on earth there is no Paradise. Who sees not heauen is surely spirit-blinde, And like a body that doth lacke a minde. Then let vs lie as dead, till there wee liue, Where only loue doth liue for euer blest; And only loue the onely life doth giue, That bringes the soule vnto eternall rest: Let vs this wicked, wretched world detest, Where gracelesse hearts in hellish sins persever, And fly to heaven, to liue in grace for euer. A Solemne Conceipt. 1 Doth Love liue in Beauties eyes? Why then are they so vnloving? Patience in her passion prouing, There his sorrowe chiefely lies. 2 Liues beliefe in lovers hearts? Why then are they vnbelieuing? Hourely so the spirit grieuing, With a thousand jealous smarts? 3 Is there pleasure in Loue's passion? Why then is it so vnpleasing, Heart and spirit both diseasing, Where the wits are out of fashion? 4 No: Love sees in Beauties eyes: He hath only lost his seeing: Where in Sorrowes only being All his comfort wholly dies. 5 Faith, within the heart of Loue, Feareful of the thing it hath, Treading of a trembling path, Doth but jealousie approue. 6 In Loves passion then what pleasure? Which is but a lunacy: Where griefe, feare, and jealousie, Plague the senses out of measure? 7 Farewell, then, (vnkindly) Fancy, In thy courses all too cruell: Woe the price of such a jewell, As turnes Reason to a franzy. A Straunge A, B, C. To learne the babies A, B, C, Is fit for children, not for mee. I knowe the letters all so well, I neede not learne the way to spell; And for the crosse, before the rowe, I learn'd it all too long agoe. Then let them goe to schoole that list, To hang the lippe at — Had I wist: I never lou'd a booke of horne, Nor leaues that haue their letters worne; Nor with a fescue to direct mee, Where euery puny shall correct mee. I will the treuant play a while, And with mine eare mine eye beguile; And only heare what other see, What mocketh them as well as mee; And laugh at him that goes to schoole, To learne with mee to play the foole. But, soft awhile: I haue mistooke, This is but some imagin'd booke, That wilfull hearts in wantons eyes Doe onely by conceits deuise; Where spell and put together, proue The reading of the rules of Loue. But if it be so, let it be: It shall no lesson be for mee. Let them goe spell that can not reede, And know the crosse vnto their speede; While I am taught but to discerne, How to forget the thing I learne. Fie on Pride. The hidden Pride that lurkes in Beauties eyes, And overlookes the humble hearts of Loue, Doth nothing else but vaine effectes deuise, That may discretion from the minde remoue. Oh, how it workes in wit, for idle wordes To buy repentance but with labour lost; While Sorrowes fortune nothing else affordes, But showres of raine vpon a bitter frost: A wicked shadowe that deceiues the sight, And breedes an itch that ouerrunnes the hart; Which, leauing Reason in a pitious plight; Consumes the spirit with a curelesse smart: While wounded Patience in her passion cries, Fie vpon Pride, that lurkes in Beauties eyes. A Farewell to Loue. Farewell Loue, and louing folly, All thy thoughts are too vnholly: Beauty strikes thee full of blindenesse, And then kils thee with vnkindnesse. Farewell wit, and witty reason, All betrai'd by Fancies treason: Loue hath of all joy bereft thee. And to Sorrow only left thee. Farewell will, and wilfull fancy, All in daunger of a frenzy, Love to Beauties bowe hath wonne thee, And togither all vndone thee. Farewell Beauty, Sorrowes agent; Farewell Sorrow, Patience pagent; Farewell Patience, Passions stayer; Farewell Passion, Loues betrayer. Sorrows agent, Patience pagent, Passions stayer, Loues betrayer, Beauty, Sorrow, Patience, Passion; Farewell life, of such a fashion. Fashion, so good fashions spilling; Passion, so with passions killing: Patience, so with sorrow wounding; Farewell Beauty, Loues confounding. A Jeasting Curse. Fie vpon that too much Beauty, That so blindeth Reasons seeing, As, in swearing all Loues duety, Giues him, no where else, a beeing. Cursèd be thou, all in kindnesse, That with Beauty Loue hast wounded; Blessing Loue, yet in such blindenesse, As in Beautie is confounded. Euer maist thou liue tormented With the faith of Loue vnfained, Till thy heart may be contented To relieue whom thou hast pained. Thus, in wroth of so well pleased, As concealeth ioyes confessing, Till my paine be wholly eased, Cursèd be thou, all in blessing. So farewell and fairely note it, He who as his soule doth hate thee, From his very heart hath wrote it, Neuer euill thought come at thee. A Solemne Toie. If that Loue had beene a king, He would haue commanded Beauty: But hee is a silly thing, That hath sworne to doe her duety. If that Loue had beene a God, He had then beene full of grace: But how grace and loue are odde, Tis too plaine a pitious case. No: Love is an idle jeast, That hath only made a woord, Like vnto a cuckoes neast, That hath neuer hatcht a bird. Then from nothing to conceiue That may any substance bee, Yet so many doth deceiue; Lord of heaven, deliuer mee. A Displeasure against Loue. Love is witty, but not wise, When he stares on Beauties eyes; Finding wonders in conceit, That doe fall out but deceit. Wit is stable, but not staied, When his senses are betraied; Where, too late, Sorrow doth proue Beauty makes a foole of Loue. Youth is forward, but too fond, When he falles in Cupids bond; Where repentance lets him see, Fancy fast is neuer free. Age is cunning, but vnkinde, When he once growes Cupid-blinde: For when Beauty is vntoward, Age can neuer be but froward. So that I doe finde in briefe, In the grounds of Natures griefe, Age, and youth, and wit doe proue, Beauty makes a foole of Love. A Farewell to Conceipt. Farewell Conceit: C?ceit no more wel fare: Hope feeds the heart with humours, to no end: Fortune is false, in dealing of her share: Virtue in heauen must only seeke a friend. Adieu, Desire. Desire, no more adieu, Will hath no leasure to regard desart: Love findes, too late, the prouerbe all too true, That Beauties eyes stoode neuer in her heart. Away, poore Loue. Loue, seek no more a way Vnto thy woe, where wishing is no wealth: In nightes deepe darkenesse neuer looke for day, Nor in hearts sicknesse euer seeke for health. Desire, Conceipt, away, adieu, farewell: Love is deceiu'd, that seeks for heauen in hell. An Unhappy, Solemne, Jeasting Curse. Oh venome, cursed, wicked, wretched eyes, The killing lookers on the heart of Loue: Where witching Beauty liues but to deuise The plague of wit, and passions hell to proue. That snowy necke that chillest, more than snowe, Both eyes and harts, that liue but to behold thee; That graceles lip, fr? wh?ce Loves grief doth grow, Who doth in all his sweetest sense infold thee. Those chaining hairs, more hard than iron chains, In tying fast the fairest thoughts of Loue: Yee shameful cheeks, that in your blushing vains The ravisht passions of the minde doe proue. Yee spider fingers of those spitefull hands, That worke but webbes to tangle Fancies eyes: That idole breast, that like an image stands, To worke the hell of reasons heresies. Those Fairy feete, whose chary steppes doe steale Those hearts, whose eies do but their shadowes see: That ruthlesse spirit, that may well reueale Where Loues confusions all included be: To thee, that canst or wilt not bend thy will, To vse thy gifts, all gratious in their nature; To Patience good, and not to Passions ill, And maist and wilt not be a blessed creature. I wish and pray, thine eyes may weepe for woe, They cannot get one looke of thy beloued; Thy snowy necke may be as colde as snowe, With colde of feare it hath no fancy moued. Thy lippe, in anger by thy teeth be bitten, It can not giue one kissing sweete of Loue; And by thy hands thy shriu'led haires be smitten, For want of holding of thy hopes behoue. Thy blushing cheekes loose all their liuely blood, With pining passions of impatient thought; That idole bodie, like a piece of wood, Consume, to see it is esteemd for nought. Those spider fingers, and those fairy feete, The crampe so crooke, that they may creepe for griefe: And, in that spirit, Sorrowes poisons meete, To bring on death, where Loue hath no reliefe. All these, and more iust measures of amisse Vpon thy frownes, on faithfull Love, befall: But sweetly smile—and then heav?s pour their blisse On thy hairs, neck, cheeks, lip, hands, feet, and all. A Quarrell with Loue. Oh that I could write a story Of Loues dealing with affection: How hee makes the spirit sory, That is toucht with his infection. But he doth so closely winde him In the plaits of will ill pleased, That the heart can neuer finde him, Till it be too much diseased. Tis a subtill kinde of spirit, Of a venome kinde of nature; That can, like a conny ferret, Creepe vnwares vpon a creature. Neuer eye that can beholde it, Though it worketh first by seeing; Nor conceipt, that can vnfolde it, Though in thoughts be all his being. Oh it maketh olde men witty, Young men wanton, women idle; While that Patience weepes, for pitty, Reason bitts not Natures bridle. In it selfe it hath no substance, Yet is working worlds of wonder; While, in phrensies fearfull instance, Wit and sense are put asunder. What it is, is in coniecture, Seeking much, but nothing finding; Like to Fancies architecture, With illusions, Reason blinding. Day and night it neuer resteth, Mocking Fancy with ill fortune; While the spirit it molesteth, That doth patience still importune. Yet for all this, how to finde it, Tis vnpossible to showe it; When the Muse that most doth minde it, Will be furthest off to know it. Yet can Beauty so reteine it In the profit of her seruice, That she closely can mainteine it, For her seruant chiefe in office. In her eye she chiefely breedes it; In her cheekes she chiefely hides it; In her seruants faith shee feedes it, While his only heart abides it. All his humour is in changing, All his work is in inuention, All his pleasure is in ranging, All his truthe but in intention. Straunge in all effectes conceiued, But, in substance, nothing sounded; While the senses are deceiued, That on idle thoughts are grounded. Not to dwell vpon a trifle, That doth Follies hope befall; Tis but a newe nothing nifle, Made for fooles to play withall. A Wish in vaine. Oh that Wit were not amazed At the wonder of his senses, Or his eyes not ouergazed In Minervas excellences. Oh that Reason were not foiled In the rules of all his learning, Or his learning were not spoiled In the sweete of Loues discerning. Oh that Beauty were not froward, In regard of Reasons duety, Or that Will were not vntoward In the waiward wit of Beauty. But since all in vaine are wishes, Patience tels them that haue past it, Poys'ned broth, in siluer dishes, Kils their stomackes that doe taste it. Wit and Reason, Loue and Learning, All in Beauties eyes are blinded, Where in sense of sweete discerning, She will be vnkindly minded. Let those hartes whose eyes perceiue her, Triumphe, but in thoughts tormented, Labour all they can to leaue her, Or else die and be contented. A Conceipt vpon an Eagle, and a Phœnix. There sate sometime an Eagle on a hill, Hanging his wings, as if he could not flie: Blacke was his coate, and tauny was his bill, Grey were his legges, and gloomy was his eye; Blunted his talents, and his traine so bruised, As if his brauery had beene much abused. This foule olde birde, of some vnhappy brood, That could abide no hauke of higher wing, (But fed his gorge vpon such bloody foode, As might, in feare, maintaine a cruell king,) Faire on a rocke of pearle and pretious stone Espied a Phœnix sitting all alone. No sooner had this heauenly birde in sight, But vp he flickers, as he would haue flowne: But all in feare to make so farre a flight, Vntill his pennes were somewhat harder growne; He gaue a rowse: as who should say, in rage He shew'd the fury of his froward age. And, for this Phœnix still did front his eyes, He cald a counsell of his kites together; With whom in haste he wold the mean deuise, By secret arte to leade an armie thither, And so pull downe, from place of highe estate, This heauenly bird, that he had so in hate. Much talke there was, and wondrous heede was held, How to atchieue this high attempt in hand: Some out were sent to soare about the field, Where flue this grace and glory of the land, To mark her course, and how she made her wing, And how her str?gth might st?d with such a king. And forthwith should such cages be deuised, As should enclose full many thousand fowles; By whom her seat should quickly be surprized, And all her birds should handled be like owles: No time detract: this deede must needs be don: And ere they went, the world was wholly won. But, soft a while: no sooner seene the land, But, ere they came in kenning of the coast, So great a force their fortune did withstand, That all the brauery of the birds was lost: Some leakt, some sanke, and some so ran on gro?d, The cages burst, and all the birds were drownd. But when the Eagle heard what was become Of all his flight, that flick'red here and there; Some sicke, some hurt, some lame, and all and s?me Or farre from hope, or all too neere in feare. He stoupt his traine, and hung his head so sore, As if his heart had never burst before. A Conceited Fancy. Pvre colours can abide no staine; The Sunne can neuer lose his light; And Vertue hath a heauenly vaine, That well may claime a queenely right: So giue my mistresse but her due, Who tolde mee all these tales of you. From heauen on earth the Sunne doth shine, From Vertue comes Discretions loue; They both are in themselues diuine, Yet worke for weaker hearts behoue: So would my mistresse had her due, To tell mee still these tales of you. But, Oh, the Sunne is in a clowde, And Vertue liues in sweetes vnseene; The earth with heauen is not allow'd; A begger must not loue a Queene: So must my mistresse haue her due, To tell mee still these tales of you. Then shine, faire Sunne, when clouds are gon; Liue, Vertue, in thy queenely loue: Choose some such place to shine vpon, As may thy Paradise approue: That when my mistresse hath her due, I may heare all this heauen in you. A Smile Misconstrued. By your leane, a little while: Loue hath got a Beauties smile From on earth the fairest face: But he may be much deceiued, Kindenesse may be misconceiued, Laughing oft is in disgrace. Oh but he doth knowe her nature, And to be that blessed creature, That doth answere Loue with kindnesse: Tush, the Phœnix is a fable; Phœbus horses haue no stable; Loue is often full of blindnesse. Oh but he doth heare her voice, Which doth make his heart reioyce With the sweetenesse of her sounde: Simple hope may be abused. Heares he not he is refused? Which may giue his heart a wound. No: Loue can belieue it neuer, Beauty fauours once and euer, Though proud Enuie play the elfe: Truthe and Patience haue approued, Loue shall euer be beloued, If my mistresse be her selfe. An Odde Humour. Pvrely faire, and fairely wise, Blessed wit, and blessed eyes, Blessed wise, and blessed faire, Neuer may thy blissed impaire. Kindely true, and truly kinde, Blessed heart and blessed minde; Blessed kind, and blessed true, Euer may thy blisse renue. Sweetely deare, and dearely sweete, Blessed where these blessings meete; Blessed meetings neuer cease; Euer may thy blisse encrease. Blessed Beauty, Wit, and Sense, Blest in Natures excellence, Where all blessinges perish neuer, Blessed maist thou liue for euer. A Waggery. Childrens Ahs and Womens Ohs, Doe a wondrous griefe disclose; Where a dugge the one will still, And the t'other but a will. Then in gods name let them cry; While they cry, they will not die: For, but fewe that are so curst, As to cry vntill they burst. Say, some children are vntoward: So some women are as froward: Let them cry them, 'twill not kill them; There is time enough to still them. But if Pitty will be pleased To relieue the small diseased, When the helpe is once applying, They will quickly leaue their crying. Let the childe then sucke his fill, Let the woman haue her will; All will hush, was hearde before; Ah and Oh, will cry no more. An Odde Conceipt. Lovely kinde, and kindly louing, Such a minde were worth the mouing: Truly faire, and fairely true, Where are all these, but in you? Wisely kinde, and kindely wise, Blessed life, where such loue lies: Wise, and kinde, and faire, and true, Louely liue all these in you. Sweetely deare, and dearely sweete, Blessed, where these blessings meete: Sweete, faire, wise, kinde, blessed, true, Blessed be all these in you. A Dolefull Fancy. Sorrow rippe vp all thy senses, Neerest vnto Horrors nature: Taste of all thy quintessences, That may kill a wretched creature. Then beholde my wofull spirit All in passions overthrowne; And full closely, like a ferret, Seize vpon it for thine owne. But if thou doe growe dismaid, When thou dost but looke on mee, When my passions, well displaid, Will but make a blast of thee. Then, in grief of thy disgraces, Where my fortunes doe deface thee, Tell thy Muses to their faces, They may learne of mee to grace thee. For thy sighes, thy sobbes, and teares, But thy common badges beene; While the paine, the spirit beares, Eates away the heart vnseene. Where in silence swallowed vp Are the sighes and teares of Loue, Which are drawne to fill the cuppe, Must be drunke to Deaths behoue. Then beholding my hearts swoune, In my torments more and more; Say, when thou dost sit thee downe, Thou wert neuer grac't before. An Epitaph vpon Poet Spencer. Movrnfull Muses, Sorrowe minions Dwelling in Despaires opinions; Yee, that neuer thought inuented How a heart may be contented; (But in torments all distressed, Hopelesse how to be redressed, All with howling and with crying, Liue in a continuall dying,) Sing a dirge on Spencers death, Till your soules be out of breath. Bidde the dunces keepe their dennes, And the poets breake their pennes; Bidde the sheepheards shed their teares, And the nymphes goe teare their haires; Bidde the schollers leaue their reeding, And prepare their hearts to bleeding; Bidde the valiant and the wise Full of sorrowes fill their eyes; All for griefe that he is gone, Who did grace them euery one. Fairy Queene shew fairest Queene, How her faire in thee is seene: Sheepeheards Calendar set downe, How to figure best a clowne, As for Mother Hubberts Tale, Cracke the nut, and take the shale: And for other workes of worth, (All too good to wander forth,) Grieue that euer you were wrot, And your Author be forgot. Farewell Arte of Poetry, Scorning idle foolery: Farewell true conceited Reason, Where was neuer thought of treason: Farewell Judgement, with inuention, To describe a hearts intention: Farewel Wit, whose sound and sense Shewe a poets excellence. Farewell, all in one togither, And with Spencers garland, wither. And if any Graces liue That will vertue honour giue; Let them shewe their true affection In the depth of Griefes perfection, In describing forth her glory, When she is most deepely sory; That they all may wish to heere Such a song, and such a quier, As, with all the woes they haue, Follow Spencer to his graue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Solemne PASSION OF THE SOVLES Love BY Nicholas Breton. Nunquam aut nunc. A Solemne Passion of the Sovles Loue. Awake, my soule, out of the sleepe of sinne, And shake off slouth the subiect of thy shame; Search out the way how best thou mayst beginne To holy worke thine humble will to frame: Then proue not weary of a little paine, When fleshe's griefe will breed the spirit's gaine. Confesse thyselfe vnworthy of the sence To learne the least of the supernall Will; Beseech the heauens in strength of their defence, To saue and keepe thee from infernall ill: Then fall to worke, that all the world may see The ioyfull loue betwixt thy God and thee. Tell of His goodnesse how He did create thee, And in His iustice how He doth correct thee, And in His loue, how He will neuer hate thee, And that His mercy neuer will reiect thee: And how He helpt thee when the world distrest thee, And with His graces how He sweetly blest thee. Say, I was sicke, and He did send me health, I was in prison, and He did set me free: And I was poore, and He did send me wealth, And I was blinde, and He did make me see, I was perplext, and He did heale my paine, And being dead, He gaue me life againe. When I was lame, Hee did my limmes restore, When I was deafe, He made me heare His voyce, When I was wounded, He did heale my sore, When I was sad, He made my soule reioyce: When I had sinn'd, He would not yet forsake me, When I was lost, He did to mercy take me. To say yet more, what He hath done for me, I needs must say His goodnesse hath no end; Who when on Earth He saw no friend to me Did make me feele I had a heauenly friend: A heauenly friend, Whose helpe doth faile me neuer, But is my comfort and my King for euer. This is my Lord, my Life, and all my loue, My liuing Loue, and louing Life indeed; This is the blessing of my best behoue, The sacred fruit whereon I sweetly feede: This is the ioy that makes my heart to sing Honour and glory to my heauenly King. Oh King, more glorious then the world can know Thee, From Whom the day euen from on high doth spring; Where glorious workes vnto the world doe shew Thee, Of glorious loue the euerlasting King: The King of Life in Whom the soule doth proue The highest glory of the heauenly loue. By Whose high hands were all things made at first, By Whose deepe wisedome they are gouern'd still; By Whom alone are blessèd or accurst, That loue His Word, or disobey His Will: By Whose sweet breath they liue that doe attend Him, And by Whose wrath they dye that doe offend Him. For who can bide the furie of His ire? Or halfe conceiue the comfort of His loue? Who plagues His foes with an infernall fire, And pl?ts His seruants in the heau'ns aboue: Who shakes the heau'ns and makes the mountains bow If Hee but once begin to knit His brow. And where He loues what will He leaue to doe, To make the soule acquainted with His kindnesse? And with what ioy will He, the spirit woo To shun the woes that grow of worldly blindnesse? What paine, or griefe, or death did He refuse, To saue their liues that He did sweetly chuse? Now for the greatnesse of His glorious power: He is Almighty, and all glory His; He made the yeere, the month, day, night, and hower, The heau'ns, earth, sea, and what in them there is: In Him alone doth all their being stand, And liue and die in His almighty hand. He spake the Word, and by His Word they were, And all was good, His secret wisedome did; His Will did worke His fauour without feare, And not a thought is from His knowledge hid: He knowes the hearts, and searcheth through the reines, And sees the roots euen of the smallest veines. He deckt the skie with sunne, and moone, and starres, And made the seas to flowe vpon the sand, Vpon whose shore His hand did set the barres, They shall not passe to ouerflowe the land: Amid the ayre He hath disperst the clouds, And onely man within His mercy shrouds. Within the depth the fish their holes do keepe, And in the rockes the conny makes his house; Into the earth the crawling wormes do creepe, And hollow rocks are harbour for the mouse: The lyon keeps his den, the bird his nest, And man alone doth but in mercy rest. Yet these and all are guided by His power, And may not passe the passage He hath giuen them; The sunne his course, the moone must know her houre, And clouds must wander but where winds haue driuen th?; Beasts know their times, and fishes know their tides, And man alone in onely mercy bides. To tell of wonders by His wisedome wrought, Euen from the greatest to the very least, Which Time declares by true experience taught, In fish, in fowle, in bird, in man and beast; Marke but the Power that doth in each abide, And how it weakens in their highest pride. The lyon first is fearfull of a bee, The elephant doth dread the little mouse: A crowing cocke the dragon may not see, The stoutest eagle subiect to the louse; The greatest oxe a little taint-worme killeth, And many a man a little canker spilleth. Yet is the lyon fearèd for his force, The elephant a huge and mighty beast; The fiery dragon kills without remorse, And eagles carry lambes vnto their nest: The oxe the taint-worme vnder foot doth tread, And man sometimes doth kill the canker's head. But when that power begins to gather pride, Then see the strength of the Almighty hand; By Whose high helpe the weakest things are tryde, To spoile the strength wherein the strongest stand: That they may knowe there is a Power on hie, In Whom they liue, and at His pleasure dye. To shew examples of the heauenly might, Against the pride of the inferiour power; The Word of Truth doth giue a glorious light, Where may bee seene in minute of an houre, How greatest stayes that on their strength were gro?ded, With headlong falls were vtterly confounded. How Pharaoh first, the proud Egyptian king, That would not suffer Israel to passe; What plagues and griefes did the Almighty bring Vpon the house, euen where his lodging was! Frogs, flyes, and lyce did freely make their way Euen to the chamber where proud Pharaoh lay. A number plagues the Lord did further threaten; His land was strooken with a darksome feare, His grasse, and corne by grasshoppers was eaten, The plague distroyd his people euery where: At last, himselfe amidst his army crownèd, Was in a moment in the Red Sea drownèd. Yet through these seas His hand did make the way, Where all His seruants went and wet no foote; Which proues His loue was His elected's stay, While rebell hearts were torne vp by the roote: Which true example to the world may proue, The glorious greatnesse of His power and loue. Goliah boasted greatly of His strength, Yet little Dauid killd him with a stone; The Madian host was strong, but yet at length, By Gideon's hand, the kings were ouerthrowne: By change of tongues fell Babylon's great tower, And Christ His Word did breake the diuel's power. Yet in itselfe what weaker is then water, Which drown'd proud Pharao and his mighty host? A louse or flie is of a little matter, Yet with such wormes are men tormented most. What strength alas is in a little stone? Yet so we reade Goliah ouerthrowne. Knowe then from whence this wonder-power groweth But from the force of the Almighty hand; Which to the world His glorious power sheweth, When with the weake, the strongest cannot stand: King Dauid wrote, and it is truly knowne, That power belongeth vnto God alone. To proue the prowesse of the heauenly Power, How many more examples might be showne! There is no yeere, no day, no night, nor hower, But some such action to the world is knowne: That Truth may well vnto His glory speake, God is of power, and all the world is weake. But since the world cannot the books containe, Wherein His workes of wonder may be writ; To admiration let His power remaine, And say, All powers are subiect vnto it: And let me of His loue and mercy write, Which is the substance of my soule's delight. This powerfull loue, the glory of all grace, When He had wrought the world vnto His will, And planted each thing in his proper place, And in the course that they continue still: Of all the workes that He in wonder wrought Made onely man the dearest of His thought. For what He made He made but man to serue, And man to serue His onely sacred loue; And in His loue doth so man's life preserue, As may the comfort of His care approue: And so approue as may this sentence giue, His onely loue doth make the soule to liue. He loued the earth when He did giue it life, He loued the life when He His image gaue it; He loued the flesh that made the bone a wife, He loued the soule when He from death did saue it: He loued him euer yet He loued him most, To fetch him home when he himselfe had lost. Come poets, ye that fill the world with fancies, Whose faining Muses shew but madding fits; Which all too soone doe fall into those franzies That are begotten by mistaking wits: Lay downe your lines, compare your loue with mine, And say whose vertue is the true diuine. For further tryall, let me giue you leaue To adde a truth vnto your idle stories; Wherewith so oft you doe the world deceiue, And gaine your selues but ill-conceited glories: Yet when you see where sweetest sights are showne, Looke on my Loue, and blush to see your owne. With sunny beauties let your loues be blest, The sunne doth fetch his light but from my Loue; You haue your wonders from the phœnix nest, Mine honour liues but in the heauens aboue: Your Muses doe your ladies' praises sing, The angels sing in glory, of my King. The earth, alas from whence your loues receiue Their flowres and sweets, their pearles &amp; precious stones, To decke themselues, with which they doe deceiue The blinded spirits of the simple ones: This earth, from whence their outward graces spring Is but the footstoole of my heauenly King. And if He so hath deckt the earth below, Imagine then the glory of His seat; Which may perswade, where angels tremble so For humane eyes the glory is too great: For where the sunne, the moone and stars haue light, For Nature's eyes the beauty is too bright. And who doth liue that euer ye did loue, But that ye could their fairest faire vnfold? And my faire Loue,—let fairest Truth approue,— No eye can liue in glory to behold: Your clearest beauty is with age declining, My Loue's bright glory is for euer shining. If ye be wise, thinke where true wisedome liueth, And then allow the honour to my Loue: If yours be kind, thinke Who the comfort giueth, And know the turkey from the turtle-doue; If constant yours, that truth let my Loue try, Who lost His life to saue His loue thereby. And let me see how liueth all your loue But on desert, the stay of all your state! And in my Loue a further life approue, Who lou'd indeed when He had cause to hate: Your fancies oft for want of fauour starue, But my Loue doth both yours and mine preserue. Then truely say, whom chiefe your loues do chuse, To cast the countenance of their fauors on! Then whom againe they wholly do refuse, In liking thought as most to looke vpon: Then do but looke vpon my Loue His choice, And whose heart most He maketh to reioyce. The wealthy, mighty, wise and well at ease, Do fit the fancies of your ladies best; But poore, and weake, and simple soules best please My heauenly Loue, to labour in his brest: And who the world doth vtterly refuse, Those doth my Loue vnto His fauour chuse. And see what power is in your louing natures, To take or giue what ye may gaine or lose; And ye shall see they are but my Loue's creatures, Whose liues are at His pleasure to dispose; And while your fauors all do fade away, My sweet Loue's blessings neuer will decay. Could ye conceiue the smallest of the sweet That doth descend from my soule's dearest Loue, Vpon the faith that falleth at His feet, That doth in praier but in mercy proue: And you will blot out euery idle line, And yeeld your soules vnto this Loue of mine. Compare a weed vnto a wholesome flowre, A cloudie euening to a sunny day, A foggie mist vnto an Aprill showre, Nouember blast vnto a bloome of May; And you shall easily see the difference plaine, Betwixt my sunshine and your showres of raine. Compare meere folly to the finest wit, The coursest copper to the purest gold; The healthfull body with an ague fit, And set the youthfull age against the old; The rauen's foule note to Philomela's voice, And quickly say which is the better choice. Compare foule pride to faire humility, A kind discretion to a doggèd nature; The clownish race to true gentility, A blessed angell to a cursèd creature; Fauors to frownes and smilings vnto scowles, And say, The phœnix makes all birdes but owles. Compare the earth vnto the heauen on hye, The spirit's treasures vnto fleshly toyes; The pibble stone vnto the azurde skie, The woes of men vnto the angels' ioyes, The lowest weaknesse vnto th' highest powers; Then see the diffrence twixt my Loue and yours. And when you see how all sweet blessings grow But from the ground of my Loue's liuing grace; And doe againe the imperfection know, Wherein you doe your fond affection place: Then all your titles to this truth resigne, There is no life but in this Loue of mine. And giue me leaue to praise my princely Loue, Although my wits are short of such a worth; And let my spirit in my passions proue, What His high hand in mercy will bring foorth: And write but truth that may be truly prouèd, My onely Loue alonely to be louèd. Before all times, all thoughts, all things He was, And euer is, and will be aye the same; That doth in wonder, Wonder's wonder passe, In Truth's high triumph of eternall fame: Where life, and loue, in grace and glory crownd, Doe sway the scepter of the heau'ns renownd. Now what He was, cannot be comprehended, Who in Himselfe doth all things comprehend; And when that all things shall be wholy ended, Himselfe, His Word, His Will shall neuer end: Whose gracious life all glorious loue beginning, Doth adde all grace and endlesse glory winning. And of His essence, this is all we finde, A Spirit fully incomprehensible; A louing God vnto His seruants kinde, And in His humane nature sensible: In wisedome's wonder, knowledge, quintessence, And in that essence highest excellence. The high Creatour of all creatures liuing, The sweet Redeemer of His seruants lost; The giorious grace, all grace &amp; glory giuing, The ioy of ioyes that glads the spirit most: The loue of life and life of loue indeed, Gainst death and hell, that stands the soule in steed. His seat is heauen, the earth His foot-stoole is, His chiefest dwelling with His soules elected; His ioy to loue and to be lou'd of His, His fauor life vnto His loues affected: His Word is truth, which doth the spirit try, Where fruitfull faith shall liue and neuer dye. His blessing is the peace of conscience, His comfort, Mercie's contemplation; His precious gift, the Spirit's patience, His mercie, Vertue's meditation: His grace the oyle that kils the spirit's euill, His death, the life that did subdue the diuell. His garments are the sundry sorts of graces, His tribute is but sinners' sacrifice; His worke, the planting vertues in their places, His gaine, the loue of humble spirits seruice: His musicke, psalmes that angels neuer cease To sing, in glorie of the King of Peace. This King of Peace, this God of Life and Loue, Who in Himselfe doth all and onely hold The highest blessings of the hearts behoue, That faithfull truth hath to the spirit told: This is the substance of my soule's delight, Vnworthy subiect of His worth to write. Yet as His mercie will vouchsafe His grace, With intercession of His high assistance; Against the power that would my thoughts deface, And proudly make against the soule resistance: I will a little giue His loue a tuch, Whose smallest praise is for my pen too much. What loue was that which made Him like man best, Of all the workes that euer He created? What loue againe did in that liking rest, To loue him so he neuer can be hated? What loue was more to giue the man a wife? What loue was more to die to giue him life? The earth within with siluer, gemmes and gold, Without with trees and herbs and fruites and flowres; The water deepe, where fishes keepe their hold, The elements with all their inward powers: These hath my Loue all made for man to chuse, And to his pleasure in his seruice vse. The fire was made to kill the chilling cold, The water made to slake the burning heat; The subtill ayre a secret breath to hold, The earth to drie when moysture is too great; These crosse in natures, yet doe meete in one, Only to serue the vse of man alone. Each bird, each beast, each fowle, and euery fish, The flesh of man must serue to cloath and feede; What eye can see, or heart of man can wish, But some way serues to stand poore man in steede? And for that cause their being first began, From Mercie's loue to serue the life of man. The light was made to glad the lightsome eye, The sound to please the pure attentiue eare; The ayre to draw a liuing breath thereby, The earth the body and the limmes to beare; The clouds, the stars, the sun, the moone, the skie, Were made for man to make him looke on hie. All these were made out of the mould of Loue: Was neuer loue came euer neere to this, Which doth a wonder in affection proue, Euen when we least deseru'd the loue of His; For when our soules did most offences doe Him, He came Himselfe in loue to call vs to Him. To make, redeeme, preserue, defend and cherish His faithfull soule, and so in loue to nourish As in His loue their liues shall neuer perish, But like the lilly liue and euer flourish: Are these not points sufficient to approue The true affection of a peerelesse loue? Yet more to say that truely may be said In humble honour of this heauenly Loue; In mercies sweet to make the soule dismaid, To see the blessing of this God aboue; The louing spirit liuely to refresh, He let His seruants see Him in the flesh. To see Him so as might not hurt their sight, For none might see His high supernall power; But in His loue to see that glorious light, That gaines that sweet that cuts off euery sowre: The Second Person of Himselfe, His Sonne, In Whom are all things to His glory done. And see the cause why so He came vnto vs, His onely loue, the onely cause we liue; And when Hee came, what comfort did He doe vs, To saue our liues His loue His life did giue; And so to saue vs from the fire of hell, That with His loue we might for euer dwell. What loue was this, to leaue His heauenly seat Among His angels, all in glory seruèd; To come to man, who did too ill intreat The sacred loue that hath his life preseruèd: From being honour'd, prais'd and glorifide, To be disgracèd, whipt and crucifide? In loue He left His highest heauenly pleasures, Aboue His angels in their heapes of ioyes; To liue on earth in sorrowes out of measures, With change of nothing but the world's annoyes In toyle and trauell, long in loue He sought vs, And with His death at last full dearely bought vs. Oh wofull trauell that He vndertooke, To bring our liues vnto His sacred loue; Which paine, nor crosse, nor death itselfe forsooke, That to our faith might His affection proue: Which left the Spirit of His Loue behinde Him, To shew the loue that seekes Him how to finde Him. In loue He came, that He might comfort doe vs, In loue went from vs to prouide our places; In loue He sent His Comforter vnto vs, In loue He guides vs with His holy graces: In loue He made, bought, keepes, and guides vs thus, And shall not we loue Him that so lou'd vs? Yes, my deare Lord, be Thou my dearest Loue, For Christ His sake, let my soul neuer leaue Thee; Who in Thy loue thy liuing truth doth proue, That makes me finde the world doth al deceiue me: And were there truth on earth as there is none, Yet were Thy loue the ioy of life alone. And let these teares be witnesse of my loue, Which first doe begge remession of my sin, And in repentance doe but mercy moue, To ope the gates of grace and let me in; Where humble Faith but at Thy feet may fall, With my soule's seruice, loue, and life, and all. Forget, O Lord, my workes of wickednesse, Whereby my soule with sorrow is oppressèd; And with the finger of Thy holinesse, In mercy touch my spirit so distressèd: And saue my life that draweth nigh to hell; Loue me a little and I shall be well. Loue? No, sweet Lord! mercy I craue, no more; My sinnes are such I dare not speake of loue; But in Thy mercy to Thy loue restore My humble faith that may but mercy proue: And so approue, that all the world may see The ioyfull loue betwixt my God and me. Oh call me home and make me heare Thy call, And heare Thee so that I may run vnto Thee; And hold me fast that I may neuer fall, But that my soule may euer seruice doe Thee: Shew some good token that the world may know My soule is blest whom Thou hast louèd so. And while I liue here in this wretched vale Of fearfull danger of infernall death; Where earthly pleasures take those soules to sale, Which haue their bargaine in the hell beneath: Let my soule's loue and life and labour be, To seeke my ioy, my loue, and life in Thee. Make me not rich, lest I forget to thinke From whence I haue the comfort of my heart; Nor in such want let Thy poore seruant sinke, That I be driuen to craue the needy part: Giue me but meanes the needy to relieue, To feed Thy flocke and not the wolfe, to grieue. Let me not listen to the sinners' songs, But to the psalmes Thy holy saints doe sing; Nor let me follow tyrants in their wrongs, But kisse the rocke where righteousnesse doth spring: Let not mine eye affect the outward part, But let me loue the vertue of the heart. And let my loue be, to behold Thy loue, And let my loue be, but to liue in Thee; And so to liue, that all the world may proue The gracious good my God hath done for me: To call my soule out of this world of wo, In faithfull loue to serue my Sauiour so. And when they see the blot of all their blame, To loue the world but all in wretched toyes; And doe confesse with inward-blushing shame, They are but sorrowes vnto heauenly ioyes; They may with me, forsake all worldly pleasure, And make Thy loue an euerlasting treasure. For Lord by Thee we are, in Thee we liue, And in Thy loue the liuing cannot die; And since Thy death did our liues wholy giue For Thy loue's sake shall wee affliction flie? No my deare Lord, let life be death to mee, So I may die to liue in loue with Thee. A ioyfull life were such a death indeede, From earthly paine to passe to heauenly pleasure; A ioyfull line for louing hearts to reade, To leaue the flesh, to take the Spirit's treasure: Whose glorious sence vnto the Sunne doth fall, That all is nothing to that All in All. And I (alas) of many thousand soules, Vnworthy most of His high worth to write; Who in His mercie's true record inroules The louing substance of the soule's delight: Must mercy cry, for feare of loue's presuming Of too high sence, may be my soule's consuming. And with the teares of true repentant loue, Looking vpon the wonders of that wonder, That in His least perfection may approue The greatest wisedome of the world put vnder: Confesse my wit as short to pen His praise, As darkest nights in light of clearest dayes. And say but this in grace and glorie's height Where Vertue's loue doth liue for euer crowned; And all the host of heauen and heauens await Vpon the highest of the heauens renowned: Whom saints and angels trembling do adore, To Him alone be praise for euer more. All honour, praise and glory euer be, Vnto my louing euerlasting King; This King of life, Who so hath louèd me, To giue my soule this gracious power to sing, In heart and mind, in man and angels' loue, All glorious glory be to God aboue.

      <field name="fulltext">A Diuine Poeme, diuided into two Partes: The Rauisht Soule, and the BLESSED WEEPER. Compiled by Nicholas Breton, Gentle-man. To the Right Honourable, discreete, and vertuous Lady, the Nourisher of the Learned and fauorer of the Godly: my singuler good Lady, the Lady Mary, Countesse of Penbrooke: Nich: Breton wisheth all the good that the Heauens will and the world can giue, to the pleasure of the Highest, and her worthy heartes desire. The Rauisht Soule. Gloria in excelsis Deo. Sing, my soule, to God thy Lord, All in glorie's highest keye; Laie the Aungells quier aboorde, In their highest holy daie; Craue their helps to tune thy heart Vnto praise's highest parte. Tell the world no world can tell What the hand of heauen deserueth; In whose onely mercies dwell All that heauen and earth preserueth; Death's confounding, Sinne's forgiuing; Faith's relieuing, Comfort's liuing. Grace and glory, life and loue, Be the summe of all thy dittie; Where a sinner's teares may proue Comfort's ioy in Mercie's pitty: Euery note in loue alluding, Endlesse glory in concluding. Prayse of prayses where Thou dwellest, Tell me, (if the world may know Thee) In what sense Thou most excellest, When Thy wonder worth doeth shew Thee, In that state of Honour's story Where Thou gain'st thy highest glorie? 'Tis not earth nor earthly wonder Can discerne Thy dearest honour; All her praises are put vnder, When Thy glory lookes vpon her. Nor in heauen Thy glorie dwelleth; Where Thy wonder most excelleth. Yet in heauen was neuer liuing Virgin, saint, nor angel's spirit; Where Thy Grace may haue the giuing Of Thine honour's highest Merite. Tis their glories admiration That deserues Thy commendation. Since then by all consequences, In the notes of Glorie's nature, And the Graces influences, Tis no earth, nor heauenly creature; In my God alone on high Is this onely mysterie. And since in His Maiestie, All and onely euer dwelleth That most glorious Deity, That all prayse's praise excelleth; Say although thy soule attend Him It can neuer comprehend Him. If thou speak'st of power, all powers To His power are in subiection; If thou speak'st of time, all houres Run their course by His direction: If of wisedome, all is vanitie, But in his Diuine humanitie. If of trueth, it is His triall: If of loue, it is His treasure: If of life, it is His diall: If of grace, it is His pleasure: If of goodnesse, 'tis His storie: If of mercy, 'tis his glorie. If of iustice, Iudgement sheweth His proceeding is impartiall: If of valour, all Hell knoweth Who is Heauen's high marshall: If of bountie, tis His blessing: If of place, tis His possessing. If of patience, His perfection: If of comfort, tis His fauour: If of vertue, His affection: If of sweete, it is His sauour: If of triumph, tis His merite: If perfection, tis His Spirit. If aboue all these thou singest Rauisht in thy reason's glory; Tell the world whatere thou bringest Admiration's wonder's story; To such height my Sauiour raiseth As aboue all praises prayseth. Let all kings and princes then In submission fall before Him; Virgins, angels, holy men, Both in heauen and earth adore Him: In His onely mercie seeing, All and onely, all your being. Babes and children, shew His glory, In your silly soules preseruing: Men and women note this storie Of the life of loues deseruing; Heauen and earth be euer reading Of this essence of exceeding. Sunne and moone and euery creature In that shining starrie skie, All confesse your brightnesse' feature In the hand of Mercie's eye: And for all your blessed powers, Shew it God's and none of your's. And when all the world together Ioyne with angels harmonie: Let my soule come singing thither With that blessed company: God in Mercie's power victorious, Be aboue all glory glorious. Amen. Sacred Muse that onely sittest In the spirits of the blessèd And the faithfull onely fittest, With their thoughts to heauen addressèd: Helpe my humble soule to sing To my glorious heau'nly King. All abandon earth's coniecture, Thinke not on so meane an instance: Make thine honour's architecture, But on Grace's glorious substance: There in comfort's confirmation Build thy heauenly habitation. Study not astronomy, Least to darknesse turne thy light: But that high diuinitie Where the day hath neuer night: There finde out that worke of worth That may bring thy wonder forth. In the teares of true contrition, Think on Mercie's blessednes: And in care of Loue's condition Of Perfection's holinesse: Then in notes of Grace's glory Make the state of all thy story. Il Christiano al honore di Christo. Before there was a light, there was a light, Which saw the world the world could neuer see; From which the world receiues his brightest sight, Yet cannot see what brightnesse there may be. From this faire light there came a liuing loue; A loue which giues the liuing all their seeing; And in the life of all their seeing proue The onely essence of their onely being. From this bright loue there came a liuing Word; A Word that doeth in wisedome signifie What heauen and earth in wonder can afford, Is but in life this loue to dignifie. For in this Word was that Almightie power Which was before that power was euer namèd; Begun before the first-beginning houre, Framing each substance that was euer framèd. And in that Word that onely wisedome dwelleth That onely knowes what onely may be knowne: And in that knowledge knowledge all excelleth, Because it knowes all knowledge is His owne. This worthy Word of wisedome's wonderment (To giue some notice of His powerfull nature) In wisedome made His will an instrument To shew Himself vnto His silly creature. The holy essence of the Deitie In Virgin's wombe did take the vaile of flesh; Bringing the dewe of blessed charitie Our withring spirits sweetly to refresh. This highest height of heauenly Maiestie, This Word of Wisedome's gracious, glorious loue, Inuested in all vertues vnitie That perfect God and perfect Man approue. From the sweet bosome of His Father's brest, Eternall Babe, of all eternall blisse; All blessed Babe, that made the mother blest, By that sweet blessed holy loue of His, From the High Throne of heau'nly Glorie's seate, Vnto this world, this worthlesse world descended; With their crosse spirits kindely to intreat For their owne good, that highly Him offended. This blessed infant of Eternitie, And onely glorious essence of the same; By the cleare light of His all-seeing eye Beholding all things, all, so out of frame, Vnto His seruants to make knowne His loue And to redeeme what lacke of loue had lost; In tender age and elder yeeres did prooue How Patience' care might be in passions crost. When first sweet Infant in the mothers armes, Fed with the milke of pure Virginitie; How did He scape the tyrant Herod's harmes, That little knew of His diuinitie. But oh, when first His presence sweet appear'd, Vnto the silly shepheards in the field: With how much ioy were all their spirits chear'd, Whose humble eyes His heauenly Face beheld. While in the heauens the angels sung for ioy, That peace by Him vnto the world was come; By Him Who should both Death and Hell destroy, And be the Sauiour of His chosen summe. The virgin-mother ioyed in her childe, And in her ioy did call her sonne her Sauiour; Whose gracious spirit in her countenance milde, Did shew the blessing of her meeke behauiour. O blessed Sonne, the Father's best belou'd, In Whom He all and onely did delight; How many wayes His workes in wonder proou'd, He held the scepter of His Father's right. In simplenesse, all harmelesse as the doue; In learning, putting all the doctours downe; In power, the hand of highest heau'ns behoue; In state, the King of Kings in Glorie's crowne. In patience, the true proofe of sufferance; In truth, the touch-stone of all vertues triall; In loue, director of Life's ordinance; In life, the hande of the eternall diall. In charitie, the giuer of all good; In bountie, the bestower of all blisse; In mercie, faithe's eternall blessed food; In grace, the guide that cannot leade amisse. In wisedome, founder of all wit and sense; In will, the worker of all wonders' worth; In essence, all the Summe of excellence; In all, that good that bringes all glorie forth. This essence all incomprehensible, Yet willing in His mercies to be knowne; That glorie might not be offensible, That in a shadowe onely should be showne: First, in the time of feeble infancie When Nature's weaknesse fled a fearèd force; Then, in the yeeres of reason's constancie, When gracious Mercie gloried in remorse; Came to the worlde to call the worlde to come, Vnto His call that had the heauens at call; Healing the sicke, the blinde, lame, deafe, and dumme, And rais'd them vp that readie were to fall. Contented with the badge of pouertie, Who might commaund both heauen and earth at wil; Lodg'd in a manger in humilitie, Who in Himselfe both heauen and earth did fill. Threatned with death, Who was the life of life; Sought to be slaine, Who was the death of death; The ground of peace, yet with the world at strife; And suffred death, yet gaue the liuing breath. Seeke heauen and earth and finde out such another, So might command and so would be commanded; Who was our King, yet would become our brother, Might strike all dumbe, and yet wold be demanded. Would leaue such pleasure and endure such paine, And for their liues, that crucified His loue; With losse of life to make their liuing gaine That prooued turkies to their turtle-doue. Who euer crau'd His help, and was denied? Who loued Him so, but left Him at His death? Who euer fail'd where faith on Him relied? Yet who for Him would spare one fauour's breath? Oh Lord, what madnesse could be more in men? Then when they knew the trueth to make a doubt; And long in darkenesse hauing light euen then, To blinde themselues to put the candle out. And blessed women that His death bewailed, While hearts' deepe griefe found comfort's high perfection; When passion's teares so much with loue preuailed, As first to them reueal'd His resurrection. The mother wept, to see her Sonne so vsed; The sinner wept to see her Sauiour dying; The cousin wept, to see her kind abused; All for His death fell to a deadly crying. The sunne eclipst, the day did loose his light, And stones did rise against their Maker's foes; The Temple rent, the people were affright, And from the graues the troubled spirits rose. All these were tokens of His holy trueth, To make men know how they were woe begon them: But gracelesse spirits voyd of gracious ruth, Ventred to take the guiltlesse blood vpon them. Here then behold the maiestie of blisse, That pray'd for them that prei'd vpon Him so; Content with all might come to Him amisse, So His with Him might to their comfort goe. His life, the lantherne of eternall light; His death, the passage to eternall rest; His grace, the marke of the most blessed sight; His loue, the lite of the eternall blest. His miracles, the witnesse of His power; His sacraments, remembrance of His loue; His resurrection, His triumphant houre; And His ascension angels' ioyes aboue. His trauaile, all to bring our soules to rest; His prayer, for our preseruation; His worke, to ioy the spirits of the blest; His Word, the assurèd trueth of our saluation. His warre a fight, but onely for our peace; His peace, the ioy wherein our soules doe liue; His woundes, the salue that doth our woes release; His triumph, freely of His grace to giue. Oh, should I runne into that world of worth, Wherein His glory duely doth increase; I should more wonder of most worth bring forth, Then thought can reach, vntill all thinking cease. But since true loue requited with vnkindnesse, Grace with disgrace, comfort with miserie; Wisedome with folly, Truth with falshood's blindnes, Honour with shame and right with iniury. Since all the contraries of true content, That wit and reason rightly maie receiue, His heauenly mercy, truely patient, All for our good full meekely did receiue. And being gon from our vngratious handes Vnto the right hand of his Father's rest; There in His hourely intercession standes, For our remission making Loue's request. And by his Worde, the message of His will, Sent by the preacher of His proouèd truthe; Doth call our soules from all accursèd ill, Vnto the good of gracious Mercie's ruth. And bids our faith to feare no hurt of sinne, And leaues vs lessons in the rules of grace; Where true repentance doth remission winne, And humble faith doth finde in heauen a place. And lets vs see each day and euerie night, A kind of figure, both of heauen and hell; And how that sinnes doe alwaies fly the light, While blessed graces doe in brightnes dwell. And howe the vertuous in the heauens are blessèd, And how the vicious in their horrors hated; And howe the iust shall haue their wrongs redressèd And how the proude shall haue their pride abated. How Charitie shall be in heauen rewarded; How Patience' care shall richly be contented; How Bribrie shall be vtterly discarded; And Tyrannie shall be in hell tormented. How humble Faith shall be in heau'n belouèd, And gracious spirits blessedly embracèd; And faithlesse spirits from all grace remoouèd, And gracelesse spirits vtterly disgracèd. When life shall be pronounc't to the elected; And Loue shall take the charge of the belouèd; And Hell receiue the soules of the reiected, To endlesse paines of gracelesse will reprouèd. When this (I say) and all that can be sayd, That may reuiue the vertuous in their death; And iustly make the reprobate afraide, With looking downe into their hell beneath. Our Lord hath left vs in those lines of Loue, That heau'nly wisedom wrote for our instruction; Yet we, all carelesse of our soules behoue, Will headlong runne vpon our owne destruction. What shall I say? But, let the atheist frie Within the coles of his owne concience' fire; Torments too true, too late will make him trie He cannot scape the furie of God's ire. And let the faithfull in their fearelesse hope, Assure their spirits of especiall grace; The breadth of heauen doth beare so large a scope, That none so poore but there shall haue a place. And let the prince not glory in his crowne, But lay it at the feet of Mercie's loue; And let the haughtie pull those humours downe, That onely worke for wicked hel's behoue. Oh, let the faire leaue painting of their faces, And onely seeke the beautie of the minde; For God alone doeth loue the inward graces, And not the shadowes that the eye doe blinde. And let the rich not let his riches rust, But seeke the wealth but of the spirit's worth; For God doth know your treasure is but dust, And ye but stewards for to let it forth. And let the wise so well employ their wits, They may attaine the knowledge to doe well; And shun the follies of those madding fits, That leauing heauen doe run the way to hell. Oh let that Queene be truely angel-like, With Grace's scepter holdes the sword of peace; And by her faith in Mercie's hande doth seeke, A ioyfull kingdome that shall neuer cease. And let that Ladie thinke herselfe a queene, That hath possession of her spirite so; That she could leaue all comforts she hath seene, And her owne selfe vnto her God to goe. And let that Souldier most that valour loue, Where God assistes the faithfull in their fight; While lacke of faith in coward feare doth prooue, Each shadowe doth the faithlesse soule affright. And let the Lawyer looke on Iustice lines, And knowe that God will right the poore man's wrong; And that such lawyers as are true diuines, Doe loue the Muses sing of Mercie's songe. And let the Marchant loue that traffique best, Where trauaile findes the treasure of God's grace; While greedie mindes that fill the golden chest, Shall neuer see their Sauiour in the face. And let the Scholler that doth studie most, Finde out the truth of life's eternall treasure; And thinke all labour in his studie lost, Where God His grace giues not the spirit pleasure. And let the louer leaue his wanton looke, With such illusions as enchaunt the minde: And onely loue the beautie of that Booke Where God alone is in His loue to finde. Abhorre the diuell and he will depart, Grace is as neere as sinne, if you will craue it; So faith doe begge it with repentant heart, For feare nor pride are euer like to haue it. Crie vnto Christ, Whom you haue crucified; In teares of loue reueale your hate of sinne; So in your greefe, when grace is glorified, Be sure in mercie doth your blisse beginne. Beleeue His worde, seeke to obey His will, And knowe the worke is His and none of your's; Striue to doe well and flye the way to ill, And be submissiue to supernall powers. Be patient in the crosse of any care, Repentant in remembrance of amisse; Constant in faith; loue God without compare, And giue all glory to that name of His. Hate him that speakes against His Maiestie, Loue him in soule that will forsake Him neuer; And know the scorners of the deity, Shall all be damn'd and frie in hell for euer. Goe to your closet, louely, there alone Bleede forth in teares, the trueth of your beliefe; And you shall see your smallest spirit's groane, Will finde a grace to ease you of your griefe. For He that knowes the secrets of your thought, And knowes the natures of your sinne's disease; Will neuer see your spirit ouer-wrought, But in the instant giue you present ease. You shal be the deare daughter of His loue, And like a father He will looke vpon you; And in His mercy so much comfort proue, That you shall neuer more be woe-begon you. Your soule in heauen shall halfe already be, The angels ginne to set your post to sing; Your spirit's eye shall in some graces, see Some shadowing glory of your heauenly King. And you all rauisht with your heauenly ioy, Will so His gracious glorious Name adore; That being healèd of your soule's annoy, This hatefull world shall be your loue no more. And you of men that haue bene long admir'd For many worthes, well worthy admiration, Shall then of angels be as much desir'd For heauenly grounds of grace's confirmation. And God Himselfe so neere Himselfe will set you, In Grace's seate where Mercy so will loue you, That Faith's regard will neuer more forget you, Nor sinne, nor death, nor deuill shall remoue you. But where the saints and angels are reciting The heau'nly trueth of high Iehouah's story; Your rauisht soule in such diuine enditing, Shall euermore be singing of His glory. To the assurèd hope of which high grace, In humble prayer let my poore humble penne, In your good fauour begge that blessed place, Where my poore heart, may happ'ly say, Amen. Gloria in excelsis Deo. The Blessed Weeper. My thoughts amaz'd, I knowe not how, of late Halfe in a slumber and more halfe a-sleepe; My troubled senses at a strange debate What kind of care should most my spirit keepe; Methought I sawe a silly woman weepe, And with her weeping, as it seem'd, so pleas'd As if her heart had with her teares beene eas'd. The place neere where she sate, was like a graue, But all vncouer'd and the bodie gone; Where in her care she nothinge seem'd to craue But that stolne bodie how to looke vpon. When weeping so, appear'd to her anon Two blessed angels and one Lord of blisse, Who came to comfort this poore wretch of His. But ere they came, how she in bitter teares Bewail'd the losse, or lacke of her deere loue; As to her words my vision witnesse beares, And my remembrance may for truth approoue; The whole discourse her passions seem'd to moue; In heart's deepe griefe and soule's high ioy conceiued, Was as I write, were not my thoughts deceiued. If euer sorrow in a sinner's hart, Liu'd to distill those droppes of bitter teares That to the world in passions can impart, Part of that paine the troubled spirit beares, Smoothing the woes wherein all pleasure weares; Oh let her shewe the deepest of her skill, In drawing out the essence of mine ill. The losse of health the heart may somewhat craze; The losse of wealth distemper may the minde; The losse of honour is a fearefull maze; The losse of freends, a care of greeuous kinde; But all these woes vpon one heart to winde, Were much to thinke but much more to beleeue; How it could liue, whom farre more crosses greeue. But from the bagge of naked pouertie To haue more wealth then all the world can giue; And from the care of all calamitie, In all the comfort of content to liue, Where settled ioy all greefe away doth driue; And sodenly growe sicke and poore againe, Who can conceiue the plague of such a paine? I wretched I, the out-cast of all grace, And banisht for my sinne from heauenly blisse; I that to hell did headlong runne my race, Not caring how my soule was led amisse, While I was cosoned, by the Serpent's hisse; I caitiffe wretch, of all the world the worst, By Sinne's iust doome to endlesse sorrow curst. I, wretched soule, whome sinne had barèd so, As left me naked of all Nature's grace; I sinke of sinne and also full of woe, As knew not how in heauen to haue a place; And in the depth of all this desperate case To be relieu'd, and cloth'd, grac't and belou'd, And on the sodaine, from all these remou'd. To lose the vesture of that Vertue's grace That cloth'd my naked soule, asham'd of sinne; To lose the beautie of that blessed Face, Where mercie's loue did comfort's life beginne; To lose the ioyes that heauens were glad to winne; To lose the life of such a louely Freend, Oh let me weepe and neuer make an end. The child that hath his father deerely louing, Who sees his faults and greatly doth abhorre them; Yet so from wrath will haue his thoughts remoouing, As he will neither checke, nor chide him for them, But puts them backe, while Pitie stands before them; And doth not onely all his faults forgiue But makes him kindely in his grace to liue. That happie child, that in his heart hath felt The blessed life of such a father's loue; Thinke how his heart must needes in sorrow melt, That must the losse of such a father prooue, And curse the death doth such a life remooue; And as a creature in all comforts freendlesse, Bleede out his time in teares of sorrow endlesse. That wicked child of too much ill am I, That had a Father held me all too deere; Who from my sinnes, did turne His angrie eye And on my sorrow shew'd a smyling cheere, And to His grace did take my soule so neere, And when asham'd to come His face before, He sayd but this, Take heede thou sinne no more. My sinnes forgiuen, what ioy my soule receiu'd, None can expresse but the repentant heart; Nor can that sorrow euer be conceiu'd, To see that Father from that child depart; But in that soule that in the bitter smart Of the true feeling of that Father's loue, Had rather death then His departure prooue. The carelesse seruant that the goods misspends, Which his kind Maister to his trust committeth: And his neat house to theeues and varlets lends, And cares for nought but what his humour fitteth; That gracious Lord that all such faults remitteth, And in His goodnesse doth so deerely loue him, That from His fauour nothing shall remooue him. So ill a seruant that doth finde the loue Of such a Lord, as neuer like was found; And in the midst of all his ioy must prooue The death to see his comfort all a-ground, His blessed Lord by theeues and varlets bound; Scoft, scourg'd and beaten, sorrowing, sighing, dying, How can that seruant cease continuall crying? That wicked seruant wretched wretch am I; That louing Maister was my liuing Lord; Whose gratious giftes abus'd vngratiously, Whose house,—my soule,—fowle spirits laide aboard, Filld full of sinnes, of graces all abhord: Yet for all this and all that I could doe, My Lord forgaue me and did loue me too. He cleans'd my soule from all my filthy sinne, And with my teares did wash it cleane againe; Draue out the feends and kindly entred in, With grace to heale that sorrow would haue slaine: And in His loue, did so my teares retaine That euerie droppe that fell vpon His feete, Vnto my soule did giue a heauenly sweet. Now such a Maister as was neuer such; So good vnto a seruant, none so ill: So much abus'd, abuses oh too much; A cursèd crue, to worke their hellish will Like rauening woolues a silly lambe to kill, Foule darknesse so to gouerne ouer light, Who would not weepe to death at such a sight? A sorrie Sister that hath such a brother As for her loue would venture losse of life, And her vnkindnesse so in kindnesse smother As twixt their loues should kill all cause of strife, Though her ill course were His heart's cutting knife; To see that Brother lose His liuing breath, How can that sister choose but weepe to death? That sister I, that Brother was my Lord, Who in His loue laide downe His life for me. Whose death, oh crosse of crosses to record, Ah wretch that euer I was borne to see: Though by His death my life must onely be. To lose a father, maister, brother such; Child, seruant, sister, how can I weep too much? Shame bad me weepe ynough to see how sinne Besmeerèd had my soule with ougly spottes, And weepe to feele how I was feltred in The wretched snarles of wicked nature's knots, And weepe to looke vpon those loathsome blots, That fild me so with greefe of all disgrace, I durst not see my Sauiour in the face. At Whose sweete feete I kneeling wept with feare I had offended to presume so neere, But sinne so fled away at euerie teare That grace beganne my heauie heart to cheere: When my deere Lord sayd not, What dost thou here? Or get thee hence, or like a dogge outspurne mee, But from my sinne vnto His mercie turne me. He felt my teares, though no man heard my weeping, And gaue me grace, though no man for me mou'd Him; Which made me know He had my soul in keeping, Though sinne too long too far from me remou'd Him. For sinne once fled, how deare in soule I lou'd Him, His words can witnesse that my soule did tuch, ‘Much is forgiuen her for she louèd much.’ He louèd much that me so much forgaue: Such my Forgiuer how much should I loue? Forgaue my sinnes and from the Feend did saue My wounded soule that could no comfort prooue, Till grace and mercie did my greefe remooue. But when I felt my paine of sinne once past In Mercie's grace, I wept with ioy as fast. But oh my soule, vnworthy of this sweete, Could not enioy these ioyfull teares too long: For sinne and sorrow did so soundly meete, As made my heart to sing another songe, When I beheld the too apparant wronge, My Lord, my Loue, my Life, my King and God, For my poore soule and for my sinnes abode. To see the Lambe that bleated but our blisse, Brought all by woolues unto a bleeding end: To see that cruell shamefull death of His Who did His course but for our comfort bend, And held our foe that was our deerest Freend: Who did such good and to receiue such ill, Weepe heart to death and die in weeping still. Vngratefull wretches, worthlesse of al grace, Rebellious subiects, traytours to your King; Could yee behold His workes before your face What choise of good His charitie did bring? And from your hearts could so much venom springe, As with the Lord of Peace to stirre such strife, To seeke His death, Who onely gaue you life? Slaues, dogges and diuels, worse if I could call yee, That so haue showne the malice of your mindes, I cannot wish more ill then shall befall yee, That are the impes of such accursèd kindes, As ougly Sathan with illusions blindes: I weepe not for your sorrow, but to see That all yee did not die to set Him free. And better had it beene for yee to die, Then haue been borne to bringe Him to His death; And by your deeds to die eternally Or liue in death within the hell beneath, Where neuer ayer shal breath you wholesome breath; But by your choice of torments make you know What yee haue done to breede my weeping so. Alas, what sinne but did my soule possesse? But that accursed crucifying sinne, That would not let your wicked soules confesse His glorious grace where grace did first beginne By true desert, all glorie due to winne; And by such grace did winne my soule so to Him: My death were sweete if it might seruice doe Him. Oh that my teares kept number with my sinnes, Or that my sinnes were drownèd in my teares; Then should my weeping shew how ioy beginnes In faithfull heart, where fearefull sorrow weares, And comfort's blisse so much contentment beares, That hope shold shew that halfe a heauen doth win: Better to weepe in grace then laugh in sinne. But what speake I of either sinne or grace? My sinne's too greeuous and my grace is gone; My life is dead, the earth is all too base, For my loue's Lord, to deigne to looke vpon, Where liues not one good creature, no not one, And what should I but weepe to liue to see I cannot see where my sweete Lord may be. But since mine eyes haue liuèd to behold The heauenly substance of my life and loue, Wherein my faith doth gratiously vnfould The onely blessing of my soule's behoue, All for the glorie of the heauens aboue, Why should I liue and looke vpon the light? Now I haue lost the ioy of such a sight. No, I doe hope my darkenesse will not hold, The night will passe and sunne againe will shine; Although my heart in comfort be a-cold My soule doth tell me that these teares of mine Shall all be dri'd vp by His hand diuine; Who so will cure me of my sinfull sore That I shall ioy in grace and weepe no more. But He is gone, my spirit's onely sweete, And I am left a wretched sinner heere; Oh that my teares could with my comfort meete And I might see my sauing health so neere As with his sight my heauie heart might cheere: Then should I loue mine eyes for such a seeing, Without which sight the ioy not in their being. Let me then seeke where I may hope to see The onely substance of my ioying sight; And neuer rest nor euer wearie be Vntill I come vnto that starre of light, Which may direct my heart and spirit right, Vnto that place where gracious loue will show My soule His presence that it loueth so. To clime to heauen it is too high a place; Sinne weighes me downe too low to seeke Him there: For hell, it is vnworthy of such grace And for the world, my sorrow witnesse beare It is not worthy of His name to heare: Then since nor heere nor there, without all doubt Within the graue I must goe seeke Him out. Oh ground more gracious then the world besides Which do'st enclose that all the world commaundes: And blessèd earth that in thy center hides His corpse for Whom my weeping soule demaunds: Tell me, oh heauens into what holy handes He is conuey'd, and where He now may be, Whom thus my heart with teares desires to see? Thus weeping still, two angels did appeare, Who as it seem'd, desirous for to know The monefull cause of this her mourning cheere, Wherefore she wept and what she sought for so; Briefely she thus her greefe beganne to shewe (Wringing her hands with many a bitter teare) Her Lord was stolne and laid she knew not where. Oh blessed angels, blessed as yee be, Tell me where is my highest blisse become? Your Lord and mine, oh tell me where is He, May cheere the heart that sorrow doth benumme; Starue not my teares, vouchsafe my soule one crumme Of comforts' care, to let me truely know Where is my Lord, that I lament for so. But doe yee aske me Whom I seeke for so? Or why I weepe? Because I cannot finde Him. Oh heauenly creature helpe my soule to knowe But where He is that I may come behinde Him, That He may know but how my loue doth mind Him: If dead I may vnto His tombe restore Him, And if aliue I may on knees adore Him. Oh happie Gardiner of this holy ground, Blest art thou borne if thou hast liu'd to see That blessed bodie where it may be found, That here lay buried: tell me (if thou be Sent from my Lord, to come and comfort me) Who hence hath stolne the substance of my blisse, And where bestowèd that holy corps of His. But doe you aske me why I weepe so much? And what I seeke? I seeke my soules delight: And weepe because I finde not any such As can direct me to so sweete a sight: This is the cause of my heart's heauie plight. Oh tell me then, and put me out of doubt, Dead or aliue, where I may finde Him out. Thus while her eyes continuall weeping kept, Came Christ Himselfe although a while vnknowne; Who askt her what she sought and why she wept: She as before vnto the angels showne, Began in teares to make her pitious mone: Her Lord was stoln, and borne she knew not whither, But if He knew He would direct her thither. But while the Lord of all her life and loue, Beheld her teares, the witness of her truth, To make her faith in heauenly fauour prooue The sweete reward of Mercie's sacred ruth, And know what life of such a loue ensueth, Spake but one word, but that word was so sweete, As would haue made her soule to kisse His feete. Marie, quoth He,—Oh Maister! blessed voice, From which my heart receiues so sweet a sound, As makes my soule in rauisht ioy reioyce, To thinke to liue that I my Lord haue found: Oh let my sinnes be in my teares so drown'd That in my ioyes my soule be euer weeping, To haue Thy presence in my comfort's keeping. I will not presse one foote beyond the line Of Thy Loue's leaue; vouchsafe me but a looke Of that sweet heauenly holy eye of Thine, Of my deere Loue the euer-liuing Booke: Wherein my teares haue such true comfort tooke, That let the world torment me nere so sore, Let me see Thee and I desire no more. Oh, sight more pretious then tongue can expresse, Wherein the eye doth comfort so the heart, The heart the soule and all in their distresse, Doe find an ease and end of euerie smart, When eie and heart and soule and euerie part Conclude in ioy, that comfort did beginne; Better to weepe in grace then laugh in sinne. And with that word, she vanisht so away As if that no such woman there had beene, But yet methought her weeping seem'd to say The spirit was of Marie Magdalen; Whose bodie now, although not to be seene, Yet by her speech it seemèd it was she, That wisht all women might such weepers be.

      <field name="fulltext">AN EXCELLENT POEME, Vpon the Longing of a Blessed Heart: which loathing the World, doth long to be With Christ. With an ADDITION vpon the DEFINITION OF LOUE. Compiled by Nicholas Breton, Gentleman. Cupio dissolui, et esse cum Christo. To the Right Honourable, my singular good Lord, The Favourer of all good Studies, and Louer of all Vertues, THE LORD NORTH, Nicholas Breton wisheth encrease of Honour, continuance of health, and eternall happinesse. [Two hopeful twinnes ioynt issues of one braine] Two hopeful twinnes ioynt issues of one braine A Rauisht Soule and Longing Spirit sends Into your bosome's high and heauenly traine, That are Witte's kinsemen and the Muses friends: Embrace them, loue them, and with iudgement's view Eye them. Beleeue me, Reader, thou shalt finde Their limmes well measur'd and proportions true; No part dissenting from their perfect kinde. Onely the fashion sits not on their clothes To make them sightly to fantasticke eyes. Pallas not Venus did the work dispose, Cutting their garments from angellick skies: Plaine is their habite yet diuine and sweete, Fit for the wise but for the wisest meete. H. T. Gent. AD LIBRUM. Goe, Booke, and balke those eyes, That loue but shadowes' sightes; And let them gape for flyes, That make but buzzards' flights. And tell the humble heart, That longes in better loue, To him thou wilt impart Thy spirit's turtle doue. Whose flesh the soule doth feed, With that eternall sweet; Wherein heart's eies may reed, How life and loue doe meet. To make the blessed see The loue, that longeth best; And what those longinges bee, Whose loue is neuer blest. That loue not misconceiu'd in thought, May neuer long for that is nought. Breton's Longing. What life hath he that neuer thinkes of loue? And what such loue but hath a special liking And what such liking but will seeke to proue The best to finde the comfort of his seeking? But while fond thoughts in Follie's packe are peeking, Better conceited wits may easely finde, The truest wealth that may enrich the minde. But since the difference 'twixt the good and bad Is easely seene in notes of their delightes; And that those notes are needefull to be had, To see whose eyes are of the clearest sights; Whose are the dayes, and whose may be the nightes; From the poor crowch vnto the princely crowne, I will the difference, as I finde, set downe. The worldly Prince longes to encrease his State To conquer kingdomes, and to weare their crownes; A foraine power by forces to abate, To make but footstooles of their fairest townes; And hates the spirits of those home-made clownes, That will not venter life for victorie; But yet forgets that God should haue the glorie. The worldly Councellour doth beat his braines, How to aduise his Soueraigne for the best, And in his place doth take continuall paines To keepe his Prince in such a pleasing rest, That he may still be leaning on his breast, Thinking his happe vnto a heauen so wrought; But yet perhaps God is not in his thought. The Souldier he delighteth all in armes, To see his colours in the field display'd; And longes to see the yssue of those harmes, That may reueale an enemie dismay'd, A forte defeated, or a towne betray'd: And still to be in action day and night, But little thinkes on God in all the fight. The worldly Scholler loues a world of bookes, And spendes his life in many an idle line: Meanewhile his heart to heauen but little lookes, Nor loues to thinke vpon a thought diuine; These thoughtes of ours, alas! so lowe encline: We seeke to know what Nature can effect; But vnto God haue small or no respect. The Poet with his fictions and his fancies, Pleaseth himselfe with humorous inuentions; Which well considered are a kinde of franzies, That carie little truth in their intentions: While Wit and Reason falling at contentions, Make Wisdome finde that Follie's strong illusion Bringes Wit and Senses wholly to confusion. The worldly Lawyer studyeth right and wronge: But how he iudgeth, there the question lyes: For, if you looke for what his loue doth long, It is the profite of his plea doth rise: There is the worldly Lawyer's Paradise! He neither longes the right nor wrong to see, But to be fingring of the golden fee. The Cosmographer doth the world suruey, The hils and dales, the nookes and little crookes, The woods, the plaines, the high, and the by-way, The seas, the riuers, and the little brookes: All these he findes within his compast bookes; And with his needle makes his measure euen; But all this while he doth not thinke of heauen. Th' Astronomer standes staring on the skie, And will not haue a thought beneath a starre; But by his speculation doth espie A world of woonder comming from afarre; And tels of times and natures, peace and warre: Of Mars his sword, and Mercury his rod; But all this while he little thinkes on God. The worldly Marchant ventreth farre and neere; And shunnes nor land nor sea to make a gaine: Thinkes neither trauaile, care, nor cost too deere, If that his profite counteruaile his paine, While so his minde is on the getting vaine, That if his shippe do safely come on shore, Gold is his God, and he desires no more. The worldly Courtier learnes to crouch and creepe, Speake faire, wait close, obserue his time and place, And wake and watch and scarcely catch a sleepe, Till he haue got into some favour's grace, And will all cunning in his course embrace, That may vnto authoritie aduance: But if he thinke on God, it is a chaunce. The worldly Farmer fils his barnes with corne, And ploughes, and sowes, and digges, and delues, and hedges, Lookes to his cattell, will not lose a horne, Fels downe his woods, and fals vnto his wedges, And grindes his axes, and doth mend their edges, And deerely sels that he good cheape hath bought; But all the while God is not in his thought. The Sayler, he doth by his compasse stand, And weies his anchors, and doth hoyse his sayles, And longes for nothing but to get on land, While many a storme his starting spirite quailes, And feare of pirats his poore heart assayles: But once on shore, carowse and casts off feare, Yet scarcely thinkes on God that set him there. The worldly Preacher talkes of sacrifice, Of sacraments, and holy mysteries: Meanewhile hee longes but for the benefice, That should preserue his purse from beggeries, Because hee loues no worldly miseries: For many a Preacher that God's Word hath taught, Shewes by his life, God liues not in his thought. The world's Physitian, that in sicknesse tries The nature of the hearbes and minerals, And in his simples and his compounds spies, Which way to make the patients funerals, Or profite by his cures in generals; Longes but to see how long they may endure: But scarcely thinkes on God in all the cure. The world's Musitian, that doth tune his voice, Vnto such notes as Musique's skill hath set: Whose heart doth in the harmonie reioice, Where pleasing consorts are most kindely met: But still perhaps his spirit doth forget, In all his himmes, and songes, and sweetest layes, To thinke of God, or of His worthy prayse. The Polititian hath a world of plots, In which his spirit hath speciall spyes; Ties, and vnties a thousand sundrie knots, In which the substance of his studie lyes, And many trickes his close experience tryes, How to deceiue the world with many a wile; But neuer thinkes on God in all the while. The Trauailer delighteth in the view Of change and choise of sundrie kinde of creatures; To marke the habites, and to note the hew Of farre borne people, and their sundrie natures, Their shapes, their speech, their gates, their lookes, their features, And longes abroade to make his life's abode: Yet happ'ly neuer longes to be with God. The Painter in his colours takes delight, And neere the life to make the liuelyhood; While onely shadowes doe deceiue the sight, That take such pleasure in a peece of wood; But doth not long for that same liuing food, Which neither eye hath seene, nor heart conceiu'd, The God of Truth, that neuer soule deceiu'd. The Louer, he, but on his Ladie thinketh, And how to catch her in a kinde content; And lookes, and leeres, and trowles the eie, and winketh; And seekes how thoughtes in silence may bee sent; And longes to see the end of his intent: And thinkes himselfe a king, to get a kisse; But where is God in all these thoughtes of his? Th' Artificer that hath a worke to doe, And bringes his hand vnto his head's deuise, Longes till he see what it will come vnto, And how his paines haue profite in the price, And hauing cast it ouer twise or thrice, Ioyes in his heart: but scarcely hath a thought, To thanke his God, that him the cunning taught. The Churle that sits and champes vpon his chaffe, And will not stirre a foote from his barne floure, Except it be among his bagges to laugh, He can the poore so with his purse devoure, Longes but to vse the poyson of his power T' enrich himselfe, to bringe a world to naught; Shewes that God neuer dwels within his thought. As for those beggerly conditions Of basest trades, that like to miry hogges, Doe shewe their spirites' dispositions, In digging with their noses vnder logges, For slime and wormes, or like to rauening dogges, Longe but for that which doth the belly fill, Most of them thinke on God against their will. These are the worldlinges, and their world's delightes Whose longing, God knowes, is not worth the louing: These are the obiects of those euill sightes, That Vertue hath from her faire eyes remoouing: These are the passions of Corruption's proouing: But they that loue and long for God His sight, In worldly trifles neuer take delight. The Prince, annointed with the oyl of Grace, Who sits with Mercie, in the seate of Peace, Will long to see his Sauiour in the face, And all his right into His handes release; (Whose onely sight would make all sorrow cease,) And lay both crowne and kingdome at his feete, But of His presence to enioy the sweete. The Councellour with heavenly Grace inspir'd, Where Wisdome guides the lineaments of Wit, Although he hath to Honour's place aspir'd, His heart doth shew it longes not after it; His loue desires a higher marke to hitte: For while he leaneth on his Prince's breast, His longing is, but with his God to rest. The Courtier, that is once in God His grace, Whateuer countenance in the Court he beares, His heart aspireth to a better place; Which humble loue doth long for with those teares, Which all too naught the pride of pleasure weares: And neuer rests vntill his God he see, With Whome his soule in loue doth long to be. The Souldier that hath fought the Spirit's fight, Will put off warre, and long to liue in peace; And not in discord, but concord delight, While gracious Kindnesse makes all quarrels cease; While Patience doth all passions so appease, That he shall finde that Souldiour onely blest, Whose faith, in God, doth set his soule at rest. The Lawyer that hath read the lawes of God, And in his heart is touchèd with His loue, And knowes the smart of the supernall rod, Will one day worke, for silly soules' behoue, Who haue their comfort in the heauens aboue; Will leaue all golden fees, to see the grace, That Mercie's justice shewes in Iesus face. The Scholler that beginnes with Christ His crosse, And seekes good speede but in the Holy Ghost, Findes by his booke that siluer is but drosse, And all his labour in his studie lost; Where Faith, of Mercie, cannot sweetly boast, And Loue doth long for any other blisse, Then what in God, and in His graces is. And such a Poet as the Psalmist was, Who had no minde but on his maister's loue, Whose Muses did the world in musique passe, That only soong but of the soule's behoue, In giuing glorie to the God aboue, Would all worlde's fictions wholly laye aside, And onely long but with the Lord to bide. The Cosmographer, that by rules of grace Surueys the citie of the heauenly saintes, Will neuer long for any earthly place, That either penne prescribes, or painter paints; But in the faith that neuer failes, nor faints, Will long to see in heauen's Ierusalem The gratious God of Glorie's diadem. The true Astronomer that sees the sunne, And knowes that God from Whome it takes his light, And in the course the moone and starres doe runne, Findes the true guider of the day and night, Longes but to see His onely blessed sight, Who sunne, and moone, and stars their brightnes giues, And in Whose face all brightnesse, glorie, liues. The Mariner that oft hath past the seas, And in his perils seene the power of God, Whose onely mercie doth the stormes appease, And bringes the shippe vnto his wishèd road, Will neuer long on earth to make abode; But in the heauens to see that blessed hande, That at His becke so rules both sea and land. The Marchant that hath cast within his minde, How much the spirit's gaine the flesh surmounts, And by his faith in Mercie's loue doth finde The ioyfull summe of such a soule's accounts, As to saluation of the whole amounts; Will leaue the world but on Christe's face to looke, Which all the faithfull make their liuing booke. The Farmer that hath felt his neighbour's neede, And found how God and Charitie are one; And knowes there is a better kinde of feede, Then grasse, or corne, or flesh, or bloud, or bone, Will wish himselfe from his world's treasure gone, Vpon those ioyes to feede in Mercie's blisse, Where Christ His presence is heauen's paradise. The true Physitian that doth knowe the natures And dispositions of each element, And knowes that God created hath all creatures Beneath, and eke aboue the firmament, And ouer all hath onely gouernment, Will onely long that glorious God to know, That giues the sicknesse and doth cure it so. The soule's Musitian that doth finde the ground Of truest musique, but in God His grace, Will thinke all singing but an idle sound, Where God His praise hath not the highest place, And onely longes to see that blessed face, Which makes the virgins, saints, and angels, sing An Halleluiah to their heauenly King. The Preacher, that doth in his soule belieue The Word of God, which to the world he teacheth, And in his spirit inwardly doth grieue, He cannot liue so heauenly as he preacheth, While faith no further then to mercie reacheth; Would wish in soule to leaue his benefice, To make himselfe to Christ a sacrifice. The Politician that hath plotted much In worldly matters, greatly to his gaine, Will finde, if God doe once his spirit tuch, Zacheus' heart will haue another vaine To clime aloft, and to come downe againe, And leaue all plots to come but to that place, Where he might see sweete Iesus in the face. Th' Artificer that hath a worke in hand, And feeles the grace of God within his heart; And by the same doth surely vnderstand, How God alone perfecteth euerie part, And onely is the giuer of all art, Will gladly leaue his worke and longe to be, Where he might Christ his soule's worke-maister see. The Painter that doth paint a daintie image So neere the life, as may be to the same, And makes an asse vnto an owle doe homage, While shadowes bring the senses out of frame, If God his heart once with His loue enflame, His pictures all will vnder foote be trod, And he will longe but for the liuing God. The Trauailer that walkes the world about And sees the glorious workes of God on high; If God His grace once kindly finde him out, And vnto heauen do lift his humble eye, His soule in faith will such perfections spie, That leauing all that he on earth can see, His loue will long but with the Lord to be. The Churle that neuer chaunc't vpon a thought Of Charitie, nor what belonges thereto; If God His grace haue once his spirit brought, To feele what good the faithfull almers doe, The loue of Christ will so his spirit wooe, That he will leaue barnes, corne, and bagges of coine, And land and life, with Iesus' loue to ioine. Thus from the Prince vnto the poorest state, Who seemes to liue as voide of Reason's sense, If God once come, Who neuer comes too late, And touch the soule with His sweet quintessence Of Mercie's gratious glorious patience, His soule will leaue whateuer it doth loue, And long to liue but with the Lord aboue. Now to the tenure of that longing time, That louing spirits thinke too long will last; The maide new maried, in her pregnant prime, Longes till the time of forty weekes be past, And blameth Time he makes no greater hast; Till in her armes she sweetly haue receiu'd Her comfortes fruite, within her wombe conceiu'd. Thus fortie weekes she labours all in loue, And at the last doth trauaile all in paine: But shortly after doth such comfort proue, As glads her heart, and makes all whole againe; So in her infant's pretty smiling vaine Pleasing herselfe, that all her greefe is gone, When she may haue her babe to looke vpon. Penelope, at her deere loue's departing, In sober kindnesse did conceale her care; Though in her heart she had that inward smarting, That Time's continuance after did declare; Where constant loue did shew, without compare, A perfect passion of true Vertue's vaine, Longing but for Ulisses home againe. How many yeeres the storie doth set downe, In which she felt the gall of Absence' greefe. When constant Faith on foule effects did frowne, Which sought to be to Charitie a theefe, Of Natures beautie the true honour cheefe: Long languishing in Absence' cruell hell; But when she saw his presence all is well. But if I may in holy lines beginne, To speake of Ioseph, and his longing loue Vnto his brethren, but to Benjamin To note the passion Nature did approue, Which did such teares in his affection moue, That well from thence the prouerbe sweet might spring, The loue of brethren is a blessed thing. Well may I see the notes of Nature's griefe, In absence of the obiect of affection; And longing for the substance of reliefe, In presence finde the life of loue's perfection, While eie and heart are led by one direction; Yet all this while I doe not truely proue The blessed longing of the Spirit's loue. When Mary Magdalene, so full of sinne, As made her heart a harbour of ill thought, Felt once the grace of God to enter in, And driue them out that her destruction sought; Her soule was then to Iesus' loue so wrought, As that with teares in true affect did proue The pleasing longing of the Spirit's loue. In griefe she went all weeping to His graue, Longing to see Him or aliue or dead; And would not cease vntill her loue might haue Her longèd fruite, on which her spirit fed, One blessed crumme of that sweet heauenly bread Of angels' food, but of her Lord a sight, Whose heauenly presence prou'd her soule's delight. Midas did long for nothing els but gold, And he was kindely choakèd for his choyce; Such longing loue doth with too many hold, Which onely doe in worldly drosse reioyce. But did they hearken to the heauenly voyce, Their diamondes should not so for drosse be sold, And they would long for God, and not for gold. Zacheus, too long, longèd for such drosse, Till Iesus came, his spirit's further ioye; And then he found his gaine did yeeld but losse, While sinne in conscience bred the soule's annoye, And vnto heauen the world was but a toye; He left it all and climèd vp a tree, To shew his longing how but Christ to see. And well he longd that so His loue receiued, Who sweetly saw, and kindly call'd him downe: His stature low, but his loue high conceiued, Who so was grac't by Mercie's glorious crowne, As hauing cause vpon his sinnes to frowne, Forgiue the workes that did deserue damnation, And fill'd his house with glory of saluation. A blessed longing of a blessed loue! Would so all soules did loue, and so did long; And in their longing might so sweetly proue The gracious ground of such a glorious songe, As kills all sinne that doth the spirit wrong; And sing with Simeon at his Sauiour's sight, “Oh now my soule depart in peace, delight!” Oh blessed Simeon, blessed was thy loue, And thy loue's longing for thy Sauiour so, Who wrought so sweetly for thy soule's behoue, As from thy prayers would not let thee goe, Till to thy loue He did His presence showe, Which made thee sing, when sorrowes all did cease, “Lord, let thy seruant now depart in peace!” “For I, according to Thy word, haue seen The glorious substance of my soule's saluation; Thy Word, in whome my trust hath euer beene, And now hath found my comfort's confirmation!” Thus did he make a ioyfull declaration Of that sweete sight of his sweet Sauiour's face, That was the glorie of his spirit's grace. How many yeeres he all in prayer spent, For the beholding of His blessed loue! What was the yssue of his hope's euent, And how his prayers did preuaile aboue, That so his God did vnto mercie moue, As to his armes to send his onely sonne The storie doth of all th' Apostles runne! He was well call'd, good Simeon, for that grace, That God had giuen the spirit of His loue; That loue that long'd but in his Sauiour's face, To see the blessing of his soule's behoue, And blessed prayer, that did truely proue A blessed soule, that could not prayer cease, Till Christ His presence came to giue it peace. So should all soules their Loue's chief longing haue, All soules I meane of euerie Christian hart, That seeke or hope both heart and soule to saue From hell, damnation, and supernall smart; This is the loue that, in the liuing part Of Mercie's power, shall finde that blessednesse, That is the spirit's onely happinesse. Nor can Loue look to limit out a time, But now and then and euermore attende; For he shall neuer to that comfort clime, That will not all his life in prayer spend, Vntil he see his Sauiour in the end; In whose sweet face doeth all and onely rest The heauenly ioy that makes the spirit blest. Blest be the spirit that so longs and loues, As did Zacheus and good Simeon: And from his faithfull prayer neuer mooues, Vntill he find his life to looke vpon, And in such loue is all so ouer-gon, That in such ioy his heart and spirit dwels, As hauing Christ, it cares for nothing els. Oh blessed Christ, the essence of all blisse, All blessed soules loue's longings' chiefe delight! What heart can thinke how that soul blessed is, That euer hath his Sauiour in his sight? The sunny day that neuer hath a night? Oh that my spirit might so euer pray, That I might liue to see that blessed day. The day that onely springeth from on high, That high day-light wherein the heauens do liue; The life that loues but to behold that eye, Which doth the glory of all brightnesse giue, And from th' enlight'ned doth all darknesse driue: Where saints doe see, and angels know to be A brighter light, then saints or angels see. In this light's loue, Oh, let me euer liue! And let my soul haue neuer other loue, But all the pleasures of the world to giue, The smallest sparke of such a ioy to proue, And euer pray vnto my God aboue, To grant my humble soule good Simeon's grace, In loue to see my Sauiour in the face. O face more faire then fairnesse can containe: O eye more bright then brightnesse can declare: O light more pure then passion can explaine: O life more blest then may with blisse compare: O heauen of heauens where such perfections are! Let my soule liue to loue, to long, to bee Euer in prayer, but to looke on Thee! But, Oh vnworthy eye of such a sight; And all vnworthy heart of such a loue; Vnworthy loue, to long for such a light; Vnworthy longing such a life to prooue; Vnworthy life, so high a suit to mooue! Thus, all vnworthy of so high a grace, How shall I see my Sauiour in the face? All by the prayer of true penitence, Where Faith in teares attendeth Grace's time, My soule doth hope in Mercie's patience, My heart all cleansèd from my sinfull crime, To see the springing of Aurora's prime, In those bright beames of that sweet blessed sunne Of my deere God, in Whome all blisse begunne. And that my soule may such a blessing see, Let my heart pray, and praying neuer cease, Till heart and soule may both together be, Blest in thy sight all sorrowes doth release; And with good Simeon then depart in peace! Oh then; but then, and onely euer then, Blest be my soule, sweet Iesus say Amen. Gloria in Excelsis Deo. What is Loue? Men talke of Loue that know not what it is: For could we know what Loue may be indeede, We would not haue our mindes so led amisse With idle toies, that wanton humours feede; But in the rules of higher reason read What Loue may be, so from the world conceal'd; Yet all too plainely to the world reueal'd. Some one doth faine Loue is a blinded God; His blindnesse him more halfe a diuell showes: For Loue with blindnesse neuer made abode, Which all the power of Wit and Reason knowes: And from whose grace the ground of knowledge growes: But such blinde eyes, that can no better see, Shall neuer liue to come where Loue may be. Some onely thinke it onely is a thought Bred in the eye, and buzzeth in the braine, And breakes the heart, vntill the minde be brought To feede the senses with a sorrie vaine, Till wits, once gone, come neuer home againe: And then too late in mad conceit do proue, Fantasticke wits are euer void of loue. Some thinke it is a babe of Beautie's getting, Nurst vp by Nature, and Time's onely breeding; A pretty worke to set the wits a whetting, Upon a fancy of an Humour's feeding; Where Reason findes but little sense in reeding. No, no: I see, children must goe to schoole; Philosophie is not for euery foole. And some againe thinke there is no such thing, But in conceit, a kinde of coynèd iest; Which onely doth of idle humors spring, Like to a bird within a Phœnix nest, Where neuer yet did any yong one rest. But let such fooles take heed of blasphemie, For Loue is high in his Diuinitie. But to be short, to learne to finde him out, 'Tis not in Beautie's eyes, nor babyes' harts; He must goe beate another world about, And seeke for Loue but in those liuing parts Of Reason's light, that is the life of arts; That will perceiue, though he can neuer see, The perfect essence whereof Loue may be. It is too cleare a brightnesse for man's eye; Too high a wisedom for his wits to finde; Too deepe a secret for his sense to trie; And all too heauenly for his earthly minde; It is a grace of such a glorious kinde, As giues the soule a secret power to know it, But giues no heart nor spirit power to show it. It is of heauen and earth the highest beautie, The powerfull hand of heauen's and earth's creation The due commander of all spirit's duety, The Deitie of angels' adoration; The glorious substance of the soule's saluation: The light of Truthe that all perfection trieth, And life that giues the life that neuer dieth. It is the height of God and hate of ill, Tryumph of Trueth, and Falshood's ouerthrow; The onely worker of the highest will; And onely knowledge that doeth knowledge know; And onely ground where it doeth onely growe: It is in summe the substance of all blisse, Without whose blessing all thing nothing is. But in itselfe itselfe it all containeth; And from itselfe, but of itselfe it giueth; It nothing loseth, and it nothing gaineth, But in the glorie of itselfe it liueth; A ioy which soone away all sorrow driueth: The prouèd truth of all perfection's storie, Our God incomprehensible in glorie. Thus is it not a riddle to be read, And yet a secret to be found in reading; But when the heart ioynes yssue with the head, In settled faith to seeke the spirit's feeding, While in the woundes that euer fresh are bleeding, In Christ His side, the faithfull soule may see, In perfect life what perfect loue may be. No further seeke then for to find out Loue, Then in the liues of euerlasting blisse, Where carefull conscience may in comfort prooue, In sacred loue that heauenly substance is, That neuer guides the gracious minde amisse: But makes the soule to finde in life's behoue, What thing indeed, and nothing else is loue! Then make no doubt of either good or bad, If this or that, in substance, or in thought; And by what meanes it may be sought or had; Whereof it is, and how it may be wrought: Let it suffice, the word of Truth hath taught, It is the grace but of the liuing God, Before beginning that with Him abode. It brought forth Power to worke, Wisedom to will, Iustice to iudge, Mercie to execute, Vertue to plant, Charitie to fill, Time to direct, Truth Falshood to confute, Pitie to pleade in Penitence's suite, Patience to bide, and peace to giue the rest, To prooue how loue doth make the spirit blest, And this is God, and this same God is Loue: For God and Loue, in Charitie are one: And Charitie is that same God aboue, In Whome doth liue that onely loue alone; Without whose grace true Loue is neuer none. Then seeke no further what is loue to finde, But only carrie God within the minde. Leaue in the world to looke for any loue, For on the earth is little faith to finde; And faithlesse hearts in too much trueth doe proue, Loue doth not liue where care is so vnkinde: Men in their natures differ from their kinde; Sinne fils the world so full of secret euils, Men should be gods to men, but they are deuils. Christ lou'd to death, yet Loue did neuer die! For Loue, by death, did worke the death of death! Oh liuing Loue, oh heauenly mystery, Too great a glory for this world beneath, The blessed breathing of the highest breathe: Blest are they borne that onely find in Thee, Oh blessed God, what blessed loue may be. Let then the Poets leaue their idle humours, That write of Loue, where there is no such thing: And let the world not hearken to those rumours, That speake of Loue, or whence that life doeth spring; Except it be in this our blessed King, And Lord of life, in Whom our soules may proue The onely life of euerliuing Loue. Let wantons weepe that laughing sought for loue, Within the gems of their mistaken ioyes; And turne with teares that perfect path to proue, That leades the spirit from the world's annoyes, Vnto that treasure that admits no toyes; But in the riches of the soule doth proue The heauenly life of blessed spirits' Loue. And let the wise, (if any such there be, As God forbid, but there were many such, That in their soules by secret wisedom see, In the true triall of true Vertue's touch, The worth that Faith cannot affect too much:) Confesse, they finde, in Trueth's effects alone, That God is Loue, without Whom there is none. Amidde the skie there is one only sunne, Amidde the ayre one only Phœnix flies; One only Time by which all houres do runne: One onely life that liues and neuer dies: One onely eye that euerie thought descries: One onely light that shewes one onely Loue: One onely Loue, and that is God aboue! To say yet further what this Loue may be; It is a holy heauenly excellence, Aboue the power of any eye to see, Or Wit to finde by World's experience; It is the spirit of life's quintessence: Whose rare effects may partly be perceiued, But to the full can neuer be conceiued. It is Repentance' sweete restoratiue, The Rosa solis the sicke soule reuiueth, It is the faithfull heart's preseruatiue: It is the hauen where happie grace arriueth; It is the life that death of power depriueth; It is, in summe, the euerlasting blisse, Where God alone in all His glorie is. It is a ioy that neuer comes in iest; A comfort that doth cut off euerie care; A rule wherein the life of life doth rest, Where all the faithfull finde their happie fare; A good that doth but onely God declare. A line that His right hand doth drawe so euen, As leads the soule the highwaye vnto heauen. If then henceforth you aske what thing is Loue, In light, in life, in grace, in God, goe looke it: And if in these you doe not truely proue, How in your hearts you may for euer booke it; Vnhappy thinke yourselues you haue mistooke it. For why the life that death hath ouer-trod, Is but the Loue of Grace, and that is God. All kinde of loue but this is but mistaken, And all conceit but this is misconceiued; All kinde of loue but this must be forsaken; All trust but in this trueth may be deceiued; All in this loue all trueth may be perceiued: All heart's beliefe and all soule's seale vnto it, All what is good this loue doeth onely doe it. What shall I say? but 'tis beyond my saying, To tell you all may of this Loue be sayd: And yet that trueth be free from all betraying, That hath no more then what she knowes bewray'd. Let me but stay, but where as shee hath staid, And say but this, as I haue said before, That Loue is God, and I can say no more. Solus Amor Deus. Solus in toto laudandus Deus. Oh blessed Loue, the life of blessednesse, If euer Thou diddest helpe a sinner's heart, Behold my teares, and in Thy holynesse Assist my spirit with Thy sacred art, That al the world may ioy to heare me sing The holy praises of my heauenly King. Inspire me with that vnderstanding power, Which may conceiue, and by desert commend The toppe of truth on that triumphant tower, Where graces dwell, and glories neuer end; Let some such angell help me in deuising, As speakes of praise in glorie's euer rising. Oh Loue, how gratious is that beautie held, That giues the world but shadowes to behold! But, Oh what glorie maist thou iustly yeeld Vnto that life which doth thy life vnfold! And while all shadowes fade and fall away, Is euer bright and neuer can decay! In Nature's beautie, all the best can be Are shadowing colours to deceiue the eye: But in this beautie may our spirits see A light wherein we liue, and cannot die; A light whereby we see that most auailes vs The comfort of our faith that neuer failes vs. How bountifull is that faire hand accounted, That of his store a little stinte bestoweth! But how in bountie hath that hand surmounted, That euer giuing, asking ouer-goeth! And for no gift shall in true grace be scanting, Doth giue itselfe to see no comfort wanting. How wise is he that teacheth how to wielde The world at will, by wicked wits deuise! But wiser much that findes that wit beguil'd, That neuer seeks the way to Paradise! Oh blessèd loue, none but thy Lord of light Doth giue the soule that perfect heauenly light! How kinde is he that doth his friend relieue, In time of need of worldly mindes reputed! But he that helpes the heart that him doth grieue, To such a minde what praise may bee imputed! How kinde is then our Christ, let His death trie, Who hated sinne, yet did for sinners die! How valiant is hee held that can subdue, By force of hand, the furie of his foe! But in whose hand such valour euer grewe, As gaue both death and hell their ouerthrow! None but my Lord, my Loue, that God of light, Who makes all powers to tremble at His sight. How patient is that poore conceit esteem'd, That can put vp a wrong, or crosse, or two! But how more patient may our Christ be deem'd, That bare all wrongs that all the world could doe! Oh peerlesse paterne of true Patience' power, That conquer'd death in passion's dying houre! How iust is he who as the law doth beare The likeliest trueth his judgement doth pronounce! But how more iuste whom neither Hope nor Feare Could ever mooue to challenge or denounce! Sweet Iesus Christ, who neuer Cæsar wrongeth, And giues to God that vnto God belongeth. How gracious is that creature to be thought, That doeth repent him of his wickednesse! But how more gracious, in Whom God hath wrought The perfect height of Grace's holinesse! It is thy life, my loue, our Lord and God, Who by His grace all sinne hath ouer-trod. How comfortable is esteem'd that hand, That heales the sick, although not neere to death! But what more comfort in that power doeth stand, Then to the dead can giue a liuing breath! My loue thou knowest that Lazarus can tell, When Marie's tears did please our Master well. What should I in particulars proceed? When all and summ that heauen and earth can show, Are short to finde how farre He doth exceede The praise of prayse where highest prayses goe: But worship Him in Whom all graces liue, Worthy more glory then the world can giue. And since my God and euerliuing Lord, All in Himselfe all height of glory holdeth; And to the faithfull onely doeth affoord, No more to know, then Mercie's care vnfoldeth: Let my soule's loue but humbly fall before Him, In admiration wholly to adore Him. For Beauty, Bounty, Wisdome, Valour, Kindnesse, Grace, Patience, Comfort, Iustice, Trueth, Perfection: In Whome all these doe liue, what Reason's blindnesse Can think to reach in Prayse's due perfection? Where in the height to haue all glory sounded, Both heau'ns and earth and angels are confounded! And since farre more then most that can be thought, Liues in the light of His incomprehension; Which neuer sense that euer proudly sought, But perisht in the instant of intention; Let my soule sing, when all hearts' strings are broken, His praise is more then can in praise be spoken! Gloria in Excelsis Deo. Hymn. When the angels all are singing, All of glory euer springing, In the ground of high heauen's graces, Where all vertues haue their places: Oh that my poore soule were neere them, With an humble heart to heare them. Then should Faith in Loue's submission, Ioying but in Mercie's blessing, Where that sinnes are in remission, Sing the ioyfull soule's confessing, Of her comfort's high commending, All in glory, neuer ending. But, ah wretched sinfull creature, How should the corrupted nature Of this wicked heart of mine, Thinke vpon that loue diuine, That doth tune the angels' voices, While the hoast of heauen reioyces! No, the songe of deadly sorrowe, In the night that hath no morrow, And their paines are neuer ended, That haue heauenly powers offended, Is more fitting to the merite Of my foule infected spirite. Yet while Mercie is remoouing All the sorrowes of the louing, How can Faith be full of blindnesse, To despaire of Mercie's kindnesse; While the hand of heauen is giuing Comfort from the euer-liuing? No, my soule, be no more sorrie; Look vnto that life of glorie, Which the grace of Faith regardeth, And the teares of Loue rewardeth: Where the soule the comfort getteth, That the angels' musique setteth. There when thou art well conducted, And by heauenly grace instructed, How the faithfull thoughtes to fashion Of a rauisht louer's passion, Sing with sainctes to aungels nighest, Halleluiah in the highest! Gloria in Excelsis Deo. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Soules Harmony. Written by Nicholas Breton. Nunquam aut Nunc. To the right Honourable and vertuous Lady, the Lady Sara Hastings, Nicholas Breton wisheth all happinesse in this world, and eternall ioyes hereafter. The Soules Harmony. GOD. Grace in all Glories height, On whom all Glories waite, Describe my ioyes conceite. IESVS. Ioy in the highest of the height of ioy, Holding the state of the Celestiall story— Eternall life, that doth all deaths destroy: Sonne to that grace, that makes the Fathers Glory, Vnmatchèd Power, in Mercies Princely might: Such is the substance of my Soules delight. CHRIST. Cleere is the Sunne, that doth for euer shine, Heauenly that light, that giues al eyes their seeing, Royal that Crown, which neuer can decline, Imperious Power, that giues all powers their being: Such is the Power, the Crown, the Light, the Sun, That neuer ends where Glory first begun. My soules loues life, &amp; lifes loues soules delight, How highly are thy holy Angels blest; That in thy grace enioy the glorious sight, Wherein the summe of all their ioy doth rest! What heauenly musike may those Muses sing, Who set their consorts by thy sacred skill; And Angels quauers make the Quiere to ring, While vertues Ayre doe all the voyces fill? How may those Spirits be with ioyes possest, That may be rauisht with this Royall sight, Where Peter sawe, and in his seeing blest My soules lifes loue, and loues lifes soules delight. O blessed Peter, blest in such a seeing: Well might he sing, Sweet Lord, here is good being. O gracious God, and Lord of mercies might, Why do I liue amid this world of woes? When euery day doth seeme to me as night, While sorrowes seeke my Spirites ouerthrowes. I heare thy word, and would obey thy will, But want the power, that might performe my due: I know the good, and fayne would leaue the ill, And feare the sorrow, that doth sinne ensue: And yet I fall into that depth of sinne, That makes me feare the iudgement of thy wrath; Vntill thy grace doth all my helpe beginne, To know what comfort, Faith in Mercy hath. Oh blessed light, that shewes in Mercies eye, While faith doth liue, that loue can neuer die. Lord, when I thinke how I offend thy will, And know what good is in obedience to it; And see my hurt, and yet continue still In doing ill, and cannot leaue to doe it; And then againe, doe feele that bitter smart That inwards breeds, of pleasures after payne; When scarce the thought is entred in my heart, But it is gone, and sinne gets in againe: And when, againe, the act of sinne is past, And that thy grace doth call me backe againe: Then in my teares I runne to thee as fast, And of my sinnes, and of my selfe complayne. What can I doe, but cry, Sweet Jesus, saue me: For I am nothing, but what thou wilt haue me. O Lord that liuest in that life of life, Which all thou art, and of thy selfe alone; Whose sacred word is that soules cutting knife, That doth deuide the marrow from the bone. O glorious God, of grace and mercy more, Then heart and soule are able to conceaue! And seest the teares that mercy doth implore, And will not Faith in feares discomfort leaue. My God, my Lord, my soules lifes dearest loue, How so my sinnes haue thy displeasure moued: Let my soules teares thy glorious mercy moue, To make me feele, how faith may be beloued; That being set from sinne and sorrow free, I may not cease to sing in praise of thee. My heauenly Loue, fr? that high throne of thine Where gracious mercy sits in Glories seat: In that true pity of thy Power diuine, That dries the teares, that mercy doe entreat. Behold, sweet Lord, these bleeding drops of loue, That melt my soule in sorrow of my sinne; And let these showres some drops of mercy moue, That in my griefe my comfort may beginne. Let not despaire confound my praying hope, That begs an almès at thy mercies gate: But let thy grace thy hand of bountie ope, That comfort yeelds, which neuer comes too late; That in the cure of my consuming griefe, My ioyfull soule may sing of thy reliefe. Oh, that my soule were purifièd so, It might no more be subiect vnto sin; And that my care might onely seeke to know, How humble grace doth mercies loue begin. Oh, that my thoughts, my words &amp; deeds were such As might not swarue from my deare Sauiours will; And that my truth might neuer haue a tutch Of false conceit, for to excuse mine ill: And that this world were vnto me a hell, But where I see his Saints in their loues seruice; And I might die, till I might liue to dwell In some such place, to do some pleasing office; That he might be, who doth my death destroy, All aboue all, and all in all, my Ioy. The worldly prince doeth in his Septer hold A kind of heauen in his authorities: The wealthy miser, in his masse of gold, Makes to his soule a kind of Paradice: The Epicure that eates and drinkes all day, Accounts no Heauen, but in his hellish rowtes: And she, whose beauty seemes a sunny day, Makes vp her heauen, but in her babies clowtes. But my sweete God, I seeke no Princes power, No misers wealth, nor beauties fading glosse; Which p?per sin, whose sweetes are inward sowre, And sorry gaynes, that breed the spirits losse. No, my deare Lord, let my Heauen onely bee In my Loues seruice, but to liue to thee. O God, forgiue the greatnesse of my sinne: I am not worthy to implore thy grace; The loathsome stinke, that I lie tumbling in, With filthy shame hath couered all my face. I haue deseru'd the depth of all thine ire, To know thy will, yet wilfully offend; My soule deserues, in the infernall fire, To feele the torments that shall neuer end. But Lord, thy mercy is aboue thy wrath, Thou doest not ioy, to see a sinners death; And true repentance in thy mercie hath The blessed food, that giues the spirit breath; Where praying hope, in heart can perish neuer, While humble faith doth liue in ioy for euer. What is the gold of all this world but drosse; The ioy but sorrow, and the pleasure, payne; The wealth, but beggery, &amp; the gayne but losse, The wit, but folly, and the vertue vayne; The power but weakenesse, and but death the life. The hope, but feare, and the assurance dout; The trust, deceit, the concord but a strife, Where one conceit doth put another out; Time but an instant, and the vse a toyle, The knowledge, blindnesse, &amp; the care a madnesse; The siluer, lead, the diamond, but a foyle, The rest, but trouble, and the mirth but sadnesse. Thus since to heauen compar'd, the earth is such, What thing is man, to loue the world so much. Oh, would man thinke but on that world of ioy, Which in the heauens the chosen shall receiue! And then againe, vpon this worlds annoy, Where hellish baytes the wicked do deceiue! Would he but looke vpon the Angels graces, The Paradises of their heauenly pleasures: And then, vpon the deuils ougly faces, With all their torments endles without measures. Would men thus make a differ?ce in their minds, Twixt light and darknesse, and the day, and night; Then would sinne die, that with illusion blinds The eye of nature from her blessed sight; And man would loue the good, &amp; hate the euill, And honour God, and tread vpon the deuill. Some heauenly Muse come helpe me sing, In Glorie of my heauenly king: And from some holy Angels wing, Where graces doe for feathers spring: Oh bring my hand one blessed Pen, To write beyond the reach of men. Let all the subiect be of Grace, Where Mercy set in Glories place, Doth stand before that shining face, That makes all other beauty base: That Heauen and earth may see the wonder, That puts all worths and wonders vnder. Let Vertues onely set the grounds Where Grace but all of Glory sounds, While Mercie heales the spirits wounds: Where faith the feare of death confounds: That heauen and earth may ioy to heare, The Musike of the Angels queere. Oh tell the world, no world can tell, How that Ioy doth all ioyes excell: Where blessed soules set free from hell, In Mercy do with Glory dwell: And with the Saints and Angels sing, In glory of their heauenly King: Sinke not a note beneath the sence Of Glories highest excellence: And keepe vnto that onely Tence, Where heauens haue all their honour thence: That Seraphins may clap their wings, To heare how Grace, of Glory sings. Oh, let the Sunne in brightnes shine, And neuer let the Moone decline: And euery starre his light refine, Before that blessed light diuine: Of whome, in whom, from whom alone, They haue their shining euery one. Let all the Azure skie be cleare, And not a mistie cloud come neere: But all that brightest light appeare, Where Angels make their merrie cheere: And all the troope of heauens may see, Where all the ioyes of heauen may be. Let Phœbus in his brightnes stay: And driue the darkesome nights away, And Virgins, Saints, and Angels play, While Martyres keepe high holy-day: And all the hoast of heauen accord, To sing in glory of the Lord. Let all the yeere be Summers spring, And Nightingales all Birds that sing, And all the fruites that grow or spring, Be brought vnto this glorious king: With all their colours and their sweetes, Before his feete to strow the streetes: Let hony-dews perfume the ayre, That all may be both sweet and fayre: That may with Mercies leaue repayre, Vnto the seate of Glories Chayre: That euery thing may fitting fall Vnto the Glory of them all. Let all the hearts, the soules, the mindes, That wisdome vnto vertue bindes, And breedes but of those blessed kindes, That gracious loue in glory findes: Agree together all in one, To glorifie our God alone. And when they all in turne are set, And in their sweetest musike met, And highest skill the note hath set, Where grace may highest glory get; My rauisht soule in mercy then, May haue but leaue to sing, Amen. Gloria in excelsis Deo.Prayse, in the nighest of the height of prayse, Strayne vp thy heart vnto thy spirits note; There, in the worth, where all thy wonder stayes, Write to the wits of all the world to quote: Tell them, oh tell them, that thou canst not tell, What grace and glory thy deare God deserueth; Whose Excellence all excellence doth excell, While him alone, all excellency serueth. Life, loue, trueth, power, grace, pity, bounty, glory, Health, comfort, wisdome, vertue, mercy, peace; These in the state of the celestiall story, Doe sound the glory that shall neuer cease: Whose holy prayses to more height arise, Then earth or heauen, or Angels can deuise. Gloria in excelsis Deo.O that my heart could hit vpon a strayne, Would strike the musike of my soules desire: Or that my soule could find that sacred vayne, That sets the consort of the Angels Quiere. Or that that Spirit of especiall grace, That cannot stowpe beneath the state of heauen; Within my soule would take his setled place, With Angels Ens, to make his glory euen. Then should the name of my most gracious King, And glorious God, in higher tunes bee sounded, Of heauenly prayse, then earth hath power to sing; Where heauen &amp; earth, &amp; Angels are confounded. And soules may sing while all heart strings are broken, His praise is more, then can in praise be spoken. Gloria in excelsis Deo.When Iob had lost his children, lands &amp; goods Patience did kill the poyson of his payne: And when his sorrowes came as fast as floods, Hope kept his heart, till comfortes came agayne. When Dauids life by Saul was often sought And worlds of crosses compast him about; Yet was his spirit neuer ouer-wrought, But in his woes, hope still did helpe him out. When the sore Cripple by the poole did lye, Full many a yeere in misery and payne; His heart on Christ no sooner set his eye, But teares mou'd grace, and he was well agayne. No Iob, nor Dauid, Cripple more in griefe: Christ giue me patience, and my hope reliefe. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MOTHERS blessing. TO THE SPIRIT OF MVCH forwardnesse, in the inclination to much goodnesse, in the loue of learning, and the honor of vertue: M. Thomas Rowe, sonne to the Lady Bartley of Stoke, Nich. Breton wisheth with continuance of health, a prosperous achieuement of his vertuous desires. The Mothers blessing. My sonne, my sonne, my best belouèd sonne, Hear my deare son, what careful charge I leaue thee: Take hold of Time, the glasse is quickly run, Trust not to Fortune, for she will deceiue thee: What ere thou art, let not the world perceiue thee, Know God, loue him, be gouern'd by his will, And haue no doubt of good, nor feare of ill. Weane laizie Will, from thriftlesse Idlenes: Beware the wanton, to abuse thy wit: Vnbridled Will breeds but vnhappines, How euer sorrowes Care would couer it: Who buyes Repentance must pay deare for it. Time, Truth, and Triall, will in one agree: The fruits of sin, Death, shame, and sorrow bee. Loue not vpon the first delightfull looke: Nor hate, vpon the first conceiuèd harme: Let not the care of Conscience be mistooke, And feare the force of the Almightie arme: Feare not mischance, nor harken to a charme. By graceles meanes, deuise not to enrich thee, And let no worlds vnworthy loue betwitch thee. If that thou serue a Thatcher, do him due: But if thou canst, subscribe not to the Clowne: Lest all too late, thou find'st it all too true, When thou hast thatcht the house, he throw thee downe, But neuer fret, how euer Fortune frowne. For what the higher powers of heau'n decree, There is no asking, why it should so bee. Breake not thy word, that well thou maist performe, For words are waide by men of worthy minde: Take heed of those, that falshoods do enforme, And strike not saile, for euery blast of winde: Nor do thy spirit to thy body binde. Giue not a Misers liberalitie, And feare the fruite of prodigalitie. Heare all men speake, but harken to the wise, Learne of the learnèd, and the vertuous loue: And let no pride thy blessed soule surprise, That may discretion from thy minde remoue: Humilitie is grac't with God aboue. And Courtesie, with honors cariage, Twixt Loue, and Beautie, make a mariage. Be kinde to those, that kindly do deserue, Cruell to none, a Tyrant is a Deuill: Haue speciall care, thy health for to preserue, And keep thee from the Epicurian euill, Loue not the eye that squints, nor lips that dreuill. Beware the Pander, and the Parasite, And do not leaue a Faulcon for a Kite. Giue not thine eare to euery Idle tale, And trust no more, then what of needs thou must: Set not the secrets of thy heart to sale, For feare, they throw thine honor in the dust, And do not loue the treasure that will rust. Make it thy day, but when the Sun doth shine, And ioy in soule, but in the loue diuine. Place not thy learning in a Library, Yet reede, and marke, remember, and apply: And till thou art a perfect Antiquary, Stand not too much vpon antiquitie: Let vertue note the best Nobilitie. Be wise in all things, that thou doest intend, A good begining makes a blessed end. Stand not on termes with persons of estate, Be truly loyall in thy life and loue: Know what belongs vnto a Magistrate, Who hath his office from the heau'ns aboue: Nor make a Gaunlet of a hedging gloue. Let Bountie euer be the fruite of thrift, For borrowing is too neere the Beggers shift. Looke into Nature with Discretions eye, And sort thy selfe with vnderstanding spirits: Build not thy Castle of conceit too high, Nor let thy hopes be grounded but on Merits, While heedles Connies feare the hunters Ferits. Giue none abuse, nor basely take disgrace, Nor loue that minde, that hath a brazen face. A blessed Colour is a maiden blush, And setled Countenance is a comely sight: Stand not too long in beating of a bush: For feare the Bird beguile thee with her flight, In idle follies, neuer take delight. Trauaile, but toile not, painfull is the pleasure, Where lacke of care, in labour hath no measure. If God haue blest thee with an inward good, Be ioyfull of his blessing, but not proud: For, be the Phænix nere so rare a Brood, Nature doth wonders in her worke-house shroud: The Sunne it selfe, sometime is in a cloud. Concealèd comforts are the kindest sweets, Where loue, and honour, with discretion meets. A boasting tongue is like a heard-mans horne, Which makes a noyse, but nothing worth the hearing: And bragging Rascalls are not to be borne, Thogh fooles of choise, sometime are worth the chering, Yet in the points of wisdoms true appearing, Presumptuous fooles, and irreligious Iewes, Emong the Nobler sort should neuer vse. Know how to loue, but know not how to hate: T' one halfe a heau'n, the tother halfe a hell: Learne what belongs to Fortune, and to Fate, And trust not all, that Idle stories tell: And do not reede, before you learne to spell. But keep thy spirit with that speciall care, That Truth may shew thee, where her honors are. Offend not God, with figuring the faire, In higher substance then may fit their sexe: And looke not after humors in the aire, That hurt the heart, or may the spirit vexe, And let no passion so thy soule perplexe, But that thou maist all discontents remoue, That may be hurtfull to thy happie loue. Regard thy followers in a kind, as friends, But make a difference in thine eyes affect: And vse their seruice in such carefull kinds, That wisedomes fame may speake of thy respect, And well deseru'd rewards do not neglect. For tis the hand, that doth the seruice binde, Although the spirit doth commaund the minde. Examine Reason by the rules of Grace, And cherish valour, but in vertues choise: In Natures Musique, dwell not on the Base, And let thine eare be pleasèd in the voyce That sounds the song, that makes the soule reioyce. Auoyd all substance of the soules annoy: And only Iesus be thy spirits ioy. If honor fall vpon thee vnawares, Note how it comes, and how it may be gone: And guide thy courses with such inward cares Thy ground may still be sure to build vpon, But needles humors neuer studie on. For Time is pretious to perfections eies, And brings the blessed soule to Paradise. Follow the warres but in a worthy cause, And Court it but for affabilitie, Be not a Rebell vnto honors lawes: For tis a maime to true Gentilitie, In all the notes of true Nobilitie. So vse thy sword in field, at home thy pen, Thou maist be both belou'd, and fear'd of men. Let not a Shaft, a Bowle, a Carde, nor Die, Take vp thy Rent a yeare before the day: A Parats feather, nor a Faulcons eie, Make thee too fast, to throw thy wealth away, Lest had I wist do keepe fooles holly day. Esteeme a horse, according to his pace, But loose no wagers on a wilde goose chase. Teare not thy throat with hollowing to hounds, Nor ride thy horse to death, to seeke a Hawke: Spoile not thine eyes with leuelling of grounds, Nor barre thine honest neighbour of his walke, But take no pleasure with a foole to talke. But harken to the shepheards what they saine Both of the Sun shine, and a showre of raine. Feed not too grosse, and drinke not ouer much, The sparing diet is the spirits feast: The Pitch and Tarre, are dangerous to tuch, And want of reason makes a man a beast: Of forcèd euils euer chuse the least. Be warnèd by a little, from the more, And take heed of an inward breeding sore. Wound not the conscience of a wofull hart, Nor take delight in doing iniury: But ease the sicke of his consuming smart, And helpe the poore man in his misery: So liue, so die, so liue, and neuer die. Relieue thy friend, but not with all thou hast, Lest thou be driuen to seeke to him as fast. Importune not a Prince in any sute, Nor to a sutor long delaie his hope: In cause of Iustice, be not ouer mute, But in a malice, do no secrets ope: But keepe thy eare within discretions scope. Smile at the bird, whose bill is ouerlong, But neuer listen to the Cuckoes song. Loose not thy paines, to teach an Owle to speake, Nor striue to wash an Ethiopian white: Make it no tryumph to subdue the weake, But vse thy force, to put the proud to flight, And in renowme, giue euery man his right. Begin no more, then so thou mean'st to finish, As of thine honor, may no sparke diminish. Trauaile to learne diuersitie of Natures, But keep at home, the care of thy content: And euer haue respect vnto those creatures, That haue their talents in thy seruice spent: And loue the soule that is to vertue bent. For euer keep this point of noblenes, Let no man note thee of vnthankfulnes. Depraue not any that do well deserue, Nor magnifie an idle headed wit: Nor let thy will from wisedomes order swarue, How euer humors disalow of it: Manage affections with discretions bit. For time will teach thee in true reasons creature, A foole, is but the weake effect of nature. In Princes Courts, do neuer presse too fast, Nor shrinke a foote from thy desert of fame: And slip no time, for once the humor past, A pleasing fansie may be out of frame: Shun all occasions of deseruèd blame. But if vnwares, thou happen to offend Let witts excuse the care of will commend. Grow not too great, for feare of Enuies figge, Yet ioy in all that vertue may aduance: Make not thy musique of a country Iigge, But leaue the Lout, to tread the Morris-daunce: And keep thy sences from Narcissus traunce. And follow not Acteon to the wood, For feare Diana, do thee little good. Studie the lawe, but to maintaine thy state, Diuinitie, to keep thy soule in peace: Logicke, but only questions to debate, Arithmeticke, but knowledge to encrease: How numbers may both multiply and cease. Philosophy, to iudge of Natures best, And Phisicke, but grosse humors to digest. And Rethoricke, to speake in tune and sence, Musique, but to remoue melancholy: Astrology, to know circumference; For Architecture, learne Geometry, And for thy trauaile, learne Cosmography. For recreation, scorne not Poetry: But for discourses, study History. To haue a kinde of superficiall sight, In hawkes and hounds, and horse, and fowle, and fish: Is not amisse, but let thy harts delight Be neuer setled in an idle dish, Nor shew thy folly in a wanton wish. Be silent to thy selfe, what ere thou thinkest, And take good heed, with wh?, and where thou drinkest. Learne for instruction, Reede for exercise; Practise for knowledge, and for gaine remember: In worldly pleasures make no paradise; Know that thou art of Christ his church a member, And do not make thine Aprill in Septenber. Vnto thy God, in youth direct thy waies, And he will blesse thee in thine agèd daies. Let Conscience know the title of a crowne; Yet know withall, there is a king of kings: Who hoisteth vp, and headlong tumbleth downe; And all the world doth couer with his wings, While heauen and earth but of his glory sings. To whom discharge the loue thou daily owest, And he will blesse thee where so ere thou goest. Winke at the world as though thou saw'st it not, And all earths treasure, but as trash despise: Let not thy folly lose that wit hath got, Nor lose an Art, by lacke of exercise: Yet let no labour, honor preiudice. Be wisely sparing, but not miserable, And rather die, then be dishonorable. Feare not a Giant, for his monstrous shape, The diuell cannot goe beyond his bounds: Nor learne to play the Monkie with an Ape, But keep thy selfe within discretions bounds, And keep thee fr? the worm the c?science wounds. Thus in thy way, let wisedome euer guide thee, And be assur'd, no euill can betide thee. Do not awake the Lion in his denne, Nor thinke the Foxe a foole before you trie him: Nor put an Eagle in a Capons penne, Nor trust a Wolfe, if that you come too nigh him; But come not neare him, if you can goe by him. For rauening beasts haue wonderfull wide Iawes, And spoile whateuer comes within their clawes. Beate not the aire with hammers in thy head, Whose dreaming labours, will but dull thy wit: And do not put thy siluer into lead, Except thou make a double gaine of it, And euer do that may thine honor fit. Know trades and traffique, merchants and their wares, But spend thy spirit in more noble cares. Be not condemnèd for a common Louer, I meane, loue maker, to a world of weemen: For care can hardly credit lost recouer, And who are bound, can neuer well be free men: Beautie hath cunning in her eyes to see men. For where she leads the heart vnto her eies, She leads it finely to fooles paradies. Boast not vpon the brauery of youth, Nor scorne the weaknesse of decripit age: But hold this for a principle of truth, Death hath a part vpon this worldly stage, Where none can scape the furie of his rage: A Tragedie, where old and young are slaine, But spight of death, the vertuous liue againe. Spend not thy care vpon a selfe conceit, In grieuing for that neuer can be had: Nor let thy wit and idle will await, Where giddie humors are inclin'd to gad; And let not melancholy make thee mad. For better shut thine eyes from such a light, Then haue thy heart tormented by the sight. Spare to discourse vpon experience, And alwaies rather answere then demaund: And let no passion shewe impatience, But make entreatie where thou maist commaund: And neuer be with flatterers ouerfawnd. Nor stand too much vpon thine owne opinion, How euer Pallas marke thee for her minion. Let not a Princesse fauour make thee proud, Nor grieue too much vpon a small disgrace: Beare not affection to a filthy dowd, Nor make an Idoll of a painted face: Nor loue a colt but of a coursers race. Nor vow thy seruice to mistaken Saints, Whose truest tytles are but honors Faints. Weare not a feather in a showre of raine, Nor swagger with a Swiser for his swill: Put not thy spirit vnto too much paine, In searching secrets farre aboue thy skill: And know a halbert from a hedging bill. And euer note those noble points of nature, That truly make an honorable creature. Forbeare thy fury on a suddaine rage, Yet in thy right be euer resolute: And let true patience choller so asswage, That honors quarrell may be absolute: Lest rashnes too much reason ouershute. For carefull valor in a cause of strife, Strengthens the hart, and giues the spirit life. Flie Machiuile his vile instructions, Which are but poysons to a princely minde: And noted well, are but destructions, That do the world with wicked humors blinde: And do the soule to hellish seruice binde. Where nothing for gaine must be forbidden, While diuels in the shape of men are hidden. Note what is done, by whom, and how, and when, And marke what issue growes of each euent: If by the sword, the purse, or by the pen, And where the honor of the action went: And how to take it for a president. For many things haue many times bene done, That had bene better, nere had bene begun. Know all the courses that thou canst attaine, But follow onely that may do thee good: In questions alwaies make thy meaning plaine, Obscurèd thoughts are hardly vnderstood, But let not choller ouerheate thy bloud. So shall thy feare of fortunes force be small, And thou shalt stand when other men do fall. Take heed my sonne, thy soule be not deceiued With any straunge, or all too strong illusion: For cares best wit cannot be misconceiued, Which sees the force of follies close intrusion, While heedlesse will brings wit vnto confusion. Be wise my sonne, in heau'nly wisedomes booke, And thou shalt angle with no diuels hooke. Loue not a Iester, nor a hackney Iade, Time is but lost in either of their triall: Rather regard the mattocke and the spade, And take the sunne to be thy truest diall: Where thou shalt see the foole a knauish spiall. Shake off the lowse that hangs vpon thy cloathes, And hate the swearer that is full of oathes. The ruffian, ruds-by, and the rascall flye, But loue the vertuous, valiant, and the kinde: Looke towards heauen, and let the world go bye, And make thy body subiect to thy minde: How ere thou winkest, be not wilfull blinde. But looke into the glory of that grace, That makes the faithfull spit in sathans face. Confound the diuell with the word of God, Looke to thy soule, it is the speciall part: And loue the life that death hath ouertrod, And to thy Sauiour wholly giue thy hart: Who saues his seruants from infernall smart. And when thy greatest sorrow doth assaile thee, Trust in his mercie, that will neuer faile thee. Mine owne deare sonne, I am no deepe diuine, But what my God hath taught me, that I teach thee: Beseeching him to blesse that soule of thine, That no illusion euer ouerreach thee; Nor wilfull sinne of lacke of grace impeach thee. Nor faithlesse thought may euer so deface thee, But that his mercie euer will embrace thee. But for my notes of natures obseruations, By long experience to my paines reuealed: Where truths c?structi?s made those confirmati?s, That too much proofe hath for assurance sealed: Which priuate care hath from the world concealed. To thee my sonne, and for thy good I hope, I do this casket of my Iewels ope. Esteeme them richer then a masse of gold, And part not with them for a world of wealth: For such a treasure is not to be sold, As is both for the soule and bodies health; Then leaue them not vnto vnworthy stealth: But in thy bosome, locke them as their louer, Till good occasion bid thee looke them ouer. And when thou findest that fitteth with thy minde, And leads thee to the groundworke of thy good: Go forward still, and further seeke to finde, How best the substance may be vnderstood; That after purging breeds the liuely blood. And thou shalt feele such pleasure in thy paine, As idle spirits haue no power to gaine. And ere I grow too fast vnto an end, Let me a little furthermore aduise thee. Be carefull in affecting of a friend, Least subtill kindnesse cunningly surprise thee: And let thus much for such respect suffice thee. Let honour, valour, truth, and wit allure thee, Or neuer of a faithfull friend assure thee. For parentage affect equalitie, For learning, vertue ioind with eloquence: For bountie, wisedomes liberalitie, For valour, resolutions patience: For profit, labour with experience. For honour, vertues inclination, For spirit, graces inspiration. Thus chuse a friend, if thou wilt fauour any, For these are they that cannot alter nature But fauour fewe, for if thou mak'st of many, Thou wilt be held a simple witted creature: Take heed therefore of a dissembling feature. Sound the condition, and approue it sound, Before thy faith be to thy fauour bound. But if thou find'st a minde of that true worth, That is not matcht in all the brokers shops: Whence thou canst draw, that true loues liquor forth, Which is not season'd with vnsauery hops: While faiths strong pillars need no vnderprops. All as a Phænix, do esteeme that friend, With whom thy life with thy affection end. But if a smoothing tongue, a fleering face, A capping knee, with double diligence, By close colloging creepe into thy grace, To make an vse of thy magnificence: Know he will but abuse thy patience. Away with such, and from thy care discard them, They purchase but disgrace that [do] regard them. And if he seeke to vndermine thy thought, And go about thee with a bad inuention: And do denie thy due desire in ought That may performe the truth of his intention: Or stand on termes in causes of contention; Then do thus much for thy assurance know, A hollow friend is but a hellish foe. And now for knowing of thine enemy, Let this suffice for reasons true direction: Who doth intrude into thy company, And make a shewe of too too much affection: Such nimble wits haue euer in reiection. And by a serpents hisse, and beare-whelpes eie, Mistrust the treason of an enemie. If he perswade thee to disloyall thought, Imagine him a villaine in the height; If that he haue with wanton humor wrought Know that an Idoll is the diuels baite: And if he cheat thee with a gaming sleight, In cares discretions leaue his company, And hold him for a cunning enemy. If he importune thee with borrowing, Or carelesse liue vpon thy purses spending: Or daily put thee off with morrowing, Till want do make thee wearie of thy lending, Then in the care of better thrifts commending, Shake off a varlet in his villany, And hold him for an inward enemy. But leauing more of friends, or foes to speake, The one too fewe, the other all to many: So many friends, their friendships daily breake, That fewe are faithfull, if that fewe be any: The Sunne so soone, the painted face will tawny. That he that hath the world well ouergone, Findes foes too many, friends, but fewe or none. But when thou wilt a seruant fitly chuse, Haue great regard vnto his qualitie: Lest lacke of care, thy kindnes do abuse: Allow no counterfeit formalitie; No prigging theft, nor prodigalitie. No pot companion, nor no prating knaue, Nor lazie Rascall, nor vncomely slaue. No slouen, sluggard, nor sheep-biter dogge, Nor wencher, night-walker, nor game player: No leering copes-mate, nor no grunting hogge; No lyar, swearer, brabbler, no way layer: No sawcie Iester, nor [no] soothsayer. No daintie tooth, nor double diligence; Nor him that hath a world wide conscience. But sober, honest, wittie, thriftie, kinde, Good shape, good face, expert, and laborous Good hand, good heart, good spirit, &amp; good minde, Discreetly carefull, but not couetous: Faithfull and firme, in perfect truths approuing, And think that seruant kindly worth the louing. Now if thy seruant vnawares offend, In secret giue him reprehension: But if you see he care not to amend, Nor of aduice take better apprehension, Mistrust his spirit of some ill intention. Away with him, and turne him to disgrace, And seeke to put a better in his place. But last of all, and not the least in charge, I wish thee looke into thy loues consort: For when the heart hath left the eye at large, Venus commaunds where Cupid scales the fort: As all too many, all too true report. Be carefull therefore in thy thoughts affection, That they be gouern'd by a good direction. Beautie with vertue, honour ioynd with kindnesse, Wit with some wealth, and person without pride: True noblenesse, without ambitious blindnesse, Faire haird, straight bodied, sweet countenance, and cleare eide; A spirit where no poison doth abide. Where these sweet birds do all in one bush sing, Who would not spend his life in such a spring? But if she be ilfauour'd, blind and old, A prattle basket, or an idle slut: A sleepie huswife, or a hatefull scold, Or such a sparrow as will not keepe cut: Spoile not thy teeth with cracking such a nut. For in the world there is no greater hell, Then in a house with such a hagge to dwell. Or if complexion with condition meete, A Croidon sanguine, and a currish nature: A minde that treads good manners vnder feete, A sorrell foretop, and a sowish feature: God blesse thee sonne, from such a wicked creature. And let thee rather leade a single life, Then kill thy selfe, to liue with such a wife. Learne then to chuse the best, and leaue the worst, And chusing well, make much of such a choise: And thou shalt see while other liue accurst, Thy heart and soule shall inwardly reioyce: Oh heartie loue, is such a heau'nly voyce, As he that know it, or doth kindly heare it, Will finde no musicke in the world come neare it. But I will leaue thee to the heau'ns direction, Beseeching God of his high heauenly grace: To settle so the care of thy affection, It take no roote in an vnworthy place: But that a virgins eye, and Angels face, So make thee ioyfull of thy happie chaine, That fancie bound, would not be free againe. But that this course, and euerie other care, May purchase and continue thy content: And that thy soule may liue, where vertues are, The happie soules eternall ornament: To him that fram'd the highest firmament. Thy heart and soule in loue all humbly bow, And to his will, thy seruice truly vow. At morne, at noone, at euening, day, and night, Vnto his mercie do confesse thy sin: And begge of him, to cleare thy blinded sight, And teach thy spirit how it may begin To finde the way that gracious loue may win. Pray, weepe and cry, vntill thou hast obtained Into his seruice to be entertained. And when thou feel'st the spirit of that grace That rules the heau'ns, come downe into thy hart: And so thy thoughts in order all to place, That vertue to dispose of euery part: When thus thou feelest that thou blessed art, Pray for continuance of that comforts blisse, That keepes the soule, it cannot go amisse. And when thou feel'st the loathing of that sinne, That long misled, that mournfull soule of thine: And the true way of grace art entred in, That doth the soule to sacred loue encline, And doth assure thee of the loue diuine, Then let thy heart, thy minde, and spirit sing, An Halleluiah to thy heauenly King. Begin with glory to his maiestie, Proceed with glorie to his holy name: Continue glorie to his Deitie, And end with glorie to his worthy fame: And endlesse be the glorie of the same. Begin, proceed, continue, end his story, With beginning, neuer ending glory. O highest glory, in the heau'ns aboue, O brightest glory, of the heau'ns behoue: O purest glory, before heau'ns to proue, O blessed glory, aboue heau'ns to loue: O louely glory, that all loue doth moue. O gracious glory, that all grace beginneth, O glorious glory, that all glory winneth. Thus my deare sonne, sing vnto God thy Lord, And sing in tune, that heau'ns may ioy to heare: And let thy tongue, thy heart, and soule accord, To chaunt it out with such a ioyfull cheare, That heau'ns may see, thou hold'st their master deare. And thy true faith may in thy spirit proue, The liuing comfort of thy heau'nly loue. But if thou doost not serue thy God aright, And humbly feare his holy maiestie: Thy clearest day will turne to darksome night, Thy wealth to want, thy wit to vanitie: Thine ease to paine, ioy to calamitie. Thy sweetest musicke to a mournfull quell, Thy life to death, thy hope of heauen to hell. For though a while he suffer thee to thriue, And finde on earth a faynèd paradies: Yet death will come, who quickly will depriue, The sences of the pleasures of thine eies: Wherein th' illusion of thy spirit lies. And thou wilt be within thy soule so torne, As thou wouldst wish, thou neuer hadst bin borne. A world of woes will ouerwhelme thy heart, And fearefull dreames affright thee in the night: A thousand torments will encrease thy smart; And dreadfull visions will thy soule affright: Thou shalt be bard from the eternall light. And in the darknesse, where all horrors dwell, Thy soule shall burne in euerlasting hell. Where thou shalt see the mizer-minded-dogge, Frie in the furnace of his molten gold: The glutton monster, and the drunken hogge, Gnawing their bones, with hunger, thirst, and cold: The murtherer in paines not to be told. The leacher so bedight in beastlinesse, As kills his soule to see his filthinesse. The tyrant tortur'd with those vgly spirits, That fed his humor with the thirst of blood: The traitor follow'd with those hungry ferits, That only fed vpon the poysned food Of damnèd soules, that neuer did man good. The theefe tormented with the shamelesse lyer, The swearers mouth, all in a flame of fyer. The pander and the wicked parasite, Shall sup the broath of hellish beastlinesse: The heretike in wilfull ouersight, Shall feed vpon the froth of foolishnesse: Boyld in the fire of all vnfaithfulnesse. The Atheist so shall feele Gods vengeance on him. That all the plagues of hell shall fall vpon him. The vniust Iudge, at least if there be any, The bribing client of ill conscience: The periur'd witnesse whereof are too many, The plotting pate of sinfull pestilence; The wrothfull spirit of impatience: All these shall iustly all their torments beare, But God blesse thee from seeing of them there. But if thou rightly serue thy Lord and God, And day and houre do sue to him for grace: When faithfull Truth this world hath ouertrod, Thy soule shall flye vnto a fairer place; Where thou shalt see thy Sauiour in the face; And in that face, that euerlasting blis, In which the brightnesse of all glory is. There shalt thou see fr? hie the day-light springing, Which darksome night hath neuer power to shade: There shalt thou heare the Saints and Angels singing, And all their ditties to his glory made; There shalt thou feele the ioyes that neuer fade. There shall thy soule more perfect ioyes possesse, Then tongue, or heart, or spirit, can expresse. There shalt thou see the bounteous richly crowned, The gratious Prince in Angels armes embraced: The vertuous souldiers with the Saints renowmed; The Iudge of Iustice, in high honor placed: The faithful witnes, in Truthes fauour graced. The virgins singing, in the Angels quier, How patient hopes vnto their heau'n aspire. There shalt thou feele the blessed ioy of peace, Wherein the life of holy loue doth rest: There shalt thou heare the Musicke neuer cease, Where Angels voyces euer are adrest, In their best tunes, to sound his glory best. Where euery one a blessed part doth beare, God blesse thee sonne, to set them euer there. Amen. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PASSIONATE SHEPHEARD, OR The Shepheardes Loue: set downe in Passions to his Shepheardesse Aglaia. With many excellent conceited Poems and pleasant Sonnets, fit for young heads to passe away idle houres. Bonerto the faithfull Shepheard, to Aglaia his faire Shepheardesse, wisheth more wealth than the Sheepes-wooll, and a better Garland then the Bay-leafe. Pastorall Verses written by the Shepheard Bonerto, to his beloued Shepheardesse Aglaia. Pastor Primus. Tell mee all yee shepheards swaines, On Mineruas Mountaine plaines: Yee that onely sit and keepe Flockes (but of the fairest sheepe) Did you see this blesséd day, Faire Aglaia walke this way? If yee did oh tell me then, If yee bee true meaning men: How shee fareth with her health, All the world of all your wealth: Say a truth, and say no more: Did yee euer see before, Such a shepherdesse as shee? Can there such another bee? Euer did your eies beholde, Pearles, or pretious stones in golde, Or the Starres in Phœbus skies, Sparkle like her sunny eyes? Doe but truth, and truth confesse: Is she not that shepheardesse, That in state of beauties stay, Caries all the praise away? Tell me truly, shepehard, tell, On your plaines did euer dwell, Such a peereles paragon, For pure eyes to looke vpon? Oh the chaste commaunding kindnes, That disswades affection's blindenes! Settes it not your hearts on fire? Yet forbiddes yee to aspire. Doth it not coniure your sences, That yee fall not in offences? Hath shee not that wit diuine, That doth all your wittes refine. And doth limite loue his measure, That he purchase no displeasure. Hath shee not your spirits wrought, In obedience to her thought, Where your hearts vnto her eye, In a kinde of Simpathie, Frame the best conceited fashion, Of a blesséd fancie's passion, Which may neuer passe that ace, That may keepe you in her grace? O yee truest harted creatures! In the truest kindest natures Who, when all your thought assemble, Neuer doe in one dissemble: In loue's beauties honour's face, Let Aglaia be your grace. Past. 2. Siluan Muses can yee sing, Of the beautie of the spring? Haue yee seene on earth that Sunne, That a heauenly course hath runne? Haue yee liu'd to see those eyes? Where the pride of beautie lies, Haue yee heard that heauenly voice, That may make loues heart reioyce? Haue yee seene Aglaia, shee Whome the world may ioy to see. If yee haue not seene all these? Then yee doe but labour leese, While yee tune your pipes to play, But an idle Roundelay. And in sad discomfort's denne: Euerie one goe bite her penne: That shee cannot reach the skill, How to clime that blesséd hill. Where Aglaiae's prayses dwell Whose exceedings doe excell, And in simple truth confesse, Shee is that faire Shepheardesse, To whome fairest flockes a fielde, Doe their seruice duely yeelde: On whome neuer Muse hath gazéd, But in musing is amazéd; Where the honour is to much, For their highest thoughtes to touch. This confesse, and get yee gone, To your places euery one. And in silence onely speake When yee find your speech to weake. Blesséd be Aglaia yet, Though the Muses die for it. Come abroad you blesséd Muses, Yee that Pallas chiefly choses, When shee would commend a creature, In the honour of loues nature. For the sweet Aglaia faire, All to sweeten all the ayre: Is abroad this blesséd day, Haste yee therefore, come away: And to kill Loue's Maladies, Meete her with your Melodies. Flora hath bin all about, And hath brought her wardrope out; With her fairest sweetest flowers, All to trimme vp all your Bowers. Bid the Shepheards and their Swaynes See the beautie of their plaines. And commaund them with their flockes To doe reuerence on the rockes. Where they may so happie be As her shadowe but to see. Bidde the Birdes in euery bush, Not a bird to be at hush: But to sit, chirip, and sing, To the beautie of the spring, Call the siluan Nimphes together, Bid them bring their musickes hither, Trees, their barky silence breake, Cracke yet though they cannot speake. Bid the purest whitest Swanne, Of her feathers make her fanne: Let the Hound the Hare goe chase, Lambes and Rabbets runne at bace. Flies be dauncing in the Sunne: While the Silke-wormes webbes are spunne. Hange a fish on euerie hooke, As shee goes along the brooke: So with all your sweetest powers, Entertaine her in your bowers. Where her eare may ioy to heare, How yee make your sweetest quire: And in all your sweetest vaine, Still Aglaia strike the straine. But when shee her walke doth turne, Then begin as fast to mourne: All your flowers and Garlands wither, Put vp all your pipes together: Neuer strike a pleasing straine Till shee come abrode againe. Past. 3. Who can liue in heart so glad, As the merrie countrie lad? Who vpon a faire greene balke May at pleasures sit and walke? And amidde the Azure skies, See the morning Sunne arise? While hee heares in euery spring, How the Birdes doe chirpe and sing: Or, before the houndes in crie, See the Hare goe stealing by: Or along the shallow brooke, Angling with a baited hooke: See the fishes leape and play, In a blesséd Sunny day: Or to heare the Partridge call, Till shee haue her Couye all: Or to see the subtill foxe, How the villaine plies the box: After feeding on his pray, How he closely sneakes away, Through the hedge and downe the furrow, Till he geets into his burrowe. Then the Bee to gather honey, And the little blacke-haird Cony, On a banke for Sunny place, With her fore-feete wash her face: Are not these with thousandes moe, Then the Courts of Kinges doe knowe? The true pleasing spirits sights, That may breede true loues delightes, But with all this happinesse, To beholde that Shepheardesse, To whose eyes all Shepheards yeelde, All the fairest of the fielde. Faire Aglaia in whose face, Liues the Shepheard's highest Grace: In whose worthy wonder praise, See what her true Shepheard saies. Shee is neither proude nor fine, But in spirit more diuine: Shee can neither lower nor leere, But a sweeter smiling cheere: She had neuer painted face, But a sweeter smiling grace: Shee can neuer loue dissemble, Truth doth so her thoughts assemble, That where wisdome guides her will, Shee is kind and constant still, All in summe she is that creature, Of that truest comfortes Nature, That doth shewe (but in exceedinges) How their praises had their breedings: Let then poetts faine their pleasure, In their fictions of loue's treasure: Proud high spirits seeke their graces, In their Idoll painted faces: My loue's spirit's lowlinesse, In affections humblenesse, Vnder heau'n no happines Seekes but in this Shepheardesse. For whose sake I say and sweare, By the passions that I beare, Had I got a Kinglie grace, I would leaue my Kinglie place. And in heart be truelie glad: To become a Country Lad. Hard to lie, and goe full bare, And to feede on hungry fare: So I might but liue to bee, Where I might but sit to see, Once a day, or all day long, The sweet subiect of my song: In Aglaiae's onely eyes, All my worldly paradise. A Solemne long enduring Passion. Past. 4. Wearie thoughts doe waite vpon me Griefe hath to much ouer gone me Time doth howerly ouer-toyle me, While deepe sorrowes seeke to spoile me Wit and sences all amazéd, In their Graces ouer gazéd: In exceeding torments tell me, Neuer such a death befell mee. Loue, oh life of more tormenting, Then the world hath inuenting. Neuer ceizd vpon a creature, In a truer killing nature. Not with Venus idle itching, Nor with vaine affectes bewitching: But with wit and reason's seeing, Nature's beauties sweetest being: Time and truth on earth declaring, Excellence hath no comparing. Not a Haire but hath in holding, Honors hart, in loues beholding: Not an eye, but in her glaunces, Graceth reason in Loues traunces, Not a looke but hath in louing, Faith too fast for euery moouing. Not a worde, but in commaunding, Daunteth folly from demaunding. Not a lippe, but makes the Cherrie, Onely held a prettie Berrie: Not a breath that softly blowes, But perfumeth where it goes: Not a truth but doth display, All the Chesse in battaile ray: Where the princely eye may see: How they all in order bee. King and Queene, Knight, Bishop, Rooke: And the Pawne his place hath tooke. Blesséd cheeke, the sweetest chaine, Of affections sweetest vaine. What can sweetest iudgements say, But thou cariest sweete away? Prettie cheeke, in whose sweet pit, Loue would liue and die to sit. Let mee thinke no more on thee, Thou hast too much wounded me: And that skarre vpon thy throate, No such starre on Stellas coate. Let me chide, yet with that stay, That did weare the skinne away: But alas shall I goe lower, In sweet similies to showe her? When to touch her praises tittle, Nature's sweetnes is to little: Where each Sinow, Limme and ioynt, Perfect shape in euery point, From corruptions eye concealed, But to vertue loue reuealed, Binde my thoughts to silence speaking, While my hart must lye a breaking. Petrarche, in his thoughts diuine, Tasso in his highest line. Ariosto's best inuention. Dante's best obscur'd intention. Ouid in his sweetest vaine: Pastor Fidos purest straine. With the finest Poet's wit, That of wonders euer writ: Were they all but now aliue, And would for the Garland striue, In the gratious praise of loue, Heere they might their passions prooue. On such excellences grownded; That their wittes would be confounded. And in enuie at my grace, To beholde this blesséd face: Finding all their wittes too weake, Of her wonder worth to speake, In a fretting humor'd vaine, Runne into their graues againe. But aye me! what inward wound, Laies my comforts all a ground? Absence, oh that world of woe, That too neere the heart doth goe: When the eye cannot beholde, That the spirit hath in holde. Loue must liue and looke a farre, In a dreame vpon a starre: But indeed beholde no light: In darke absence onely night: But what haue I said? aye me! In the darkest night I see: Sight of absence such a presence Of Mineruas excellence. In loue's liuing memorie, That the light can neuer die. No, first die all Poetts' loue, Ere faith such a fiction prooue. In obliuious light to place, Such a blesséd starre of grace: As in bright Aglaiae's eyes, Shewes an earthly paradise. If my Suite be not too great, Thus much let thy swaine entreate: Where no colde suspect can harme thee, Looke into my hearte and warme thee, Turne my Musicke to thy minde, Let it know no other kinde. Breake my pipe if that it play, Other then the rounddelay. Cut my throate if that I sing, But vnto thy fauour's string. Neuer grace my louely flocke, But vpon the blessed rocke, Where thy Grace may giue them feeding, And thy blessing all their breeding. I haue neither Plummes nor Cherries, Nuttes, nor Aples, nor Straw-berries; Pinnes nor Laces, Pointes nor gloues, Nor a payre of painted Doues: Shuttle-Cocke nor trundle ball, To present thy loue with all: But a heart as true and kinde, As an honest faithfull minde Can deuice for to inuent, To thy patience I present: At thy fairest feete it lies: Blesse it with thy blesséd eyes: Take it vp into thy handes, At whose onely grace it standes, To be comforted for euer, Or to looke for comfort neuer: Oh it is a strange affecte, That my fancie doth effect. I am caught and can not start, Wit and reason, eye and heart: All are witnesses to mee, Loue hath sworne me slaue to thee, Let me then be but thy slaue, And no further fauour craue: Send mee foorth to tende thy flocke, On the highest Mountaine rocke. Or commaund me but to goe, To the valley grownd belowe: All shall be a like to me, Where it please thee I shall bee. Let my face be what thou wilt: Saue my life, or see it spilt. Keepe fasting on thy Mountaine: Charge me not come neere thy Fountaine. In the stormes and bitter blastes, Where the skie all ouercasts. In the coldest frost and snowe, That the earth did euer knowe: Let me sit and bite my thumbes, Where I see no comfort comes. All the sorrowes I can prooue, Cannot put me from my loue. Tell me that thou art content, To beholde me passion rente, That thou know'st I deerely loue thee, Yet withall it cannot mooue thee. That thy pride doth growe so great, Nothing can thy grace intreate, That thou wilt so cruell bee, As to kill my loue and mee: That thou wilt no foode reserue, But my flockes and I shall sterue. Be thy rage yet nere so great, When my little Lambes doe bleate, To beholde their Shepheard die: Then will truth her passion trie. How a Hart it selfe hath spent, With concealing of content. Past. 5. Now witts prooue what yee can doe, I haue worke to set yee to: That will trie the Quintessence Of your humor's excellence. Tis no dreadefull Tragœdy, Nor no pleasant Comœdie, Tis no fiction of a fancy, Nor a furie of a franzie, But a subject of that worth, That must bring strange wonders foorth. Yet take heede to flye to high, Least you lose your winges thereby. Keepe your compasse in that care, That doth onely truth declare. Where in safety of conceite, Yee may winne your honor's height. There if ye haue power to finde, Prayses in their purest kinde: In Aglaias blesséd name, Worke to winne your worthy fame. Seeke not out for Similes, Least yee doe your labour leese. And for figures neuer take them, Least shee doe but Ciphers make them, And for substance truely founded, Loue will in her Grace be grounded. But if in heigh Contemplation Of your sence's Admiration, Yee do finde in strange coniecture, Reasons wonders Architecture: In a frame of such a fashion, As doth plundge the hart in passion, In conceauing cares beholding, How to fall vpon vnfolding, Then in silence set it downe, Of the blesséd Lawrell crowne: Let Aglaia take the grace, Where the graces haue their place. And in fine let this suffise yee, That I kindely doe aduise yee, How so ere yee are conceited, Thus let all your Cares be straited. Mooue not from her, nor yet mooue her, Loue but doe not say yee loue her: So that passions sweetly wittie, May in patience best haue pittie: So liue happie to attend her, But if needes yee must commend her, To this counte your prayses call: In her selfe, her selfe is all. Sundry sweet Sonnets and Passionated Poems. A farewell to the world and the pleasures thereof. Sonet I. Now for the last farewell I meane to make, To all the troubles, of my tiréd thought: This leaue at last, and this last leaue I take, Of some and all that haue my sorrowe sought. First youth farewell the fore Runner of wit, A time more staide, hath taught me better stages, Then where repentance doth with sorrowe sit, To shew the ruines of vnbridled Ages. Next farewell Beautie, thou bewitching glasse, That blind'st the eye, of all unseason'd seeing: Mine eye now sees, wherein my blindnesse was, I could not see my blindnesse in thy being. Friendship farewell, where faith doth finde no trust, For men are Monsters, and then what are women? Experience now prooues Iudgement was vniust, Where wit was folly, that made slaues of free-men. And loue farewell, the Laborinthe of time, Which killes the spirits with continuall care, I now haue found the Snaile out by his slime, And will not come, where such slye creepers are. And power farewell, the perill of conceite, Where pride is hellish in impatience: Strong is my weakenes, that now bids me waite, But on the blessing of obedience. And hope farewell, the weakest holde of wit, That euer help't, the heart to happinesse: For wisdome's care, that well hath sounded it, Findes it a flatterer but of idlenes. And farewell fortune, the moste idle fiction, That euer fancy laide her labour on: Truth, against whome there is no contradiction, Showes one of force, but fortune there is none. And arte farewell, the onely woe of wit, That beates the Anuile of a busy braine, With simple skill I now had rather sit Then work for grace, and other get the gaine. And farewell time, that neuer giuest rest, Vnto the body or the spirits paine: Eternall blisse, hath so my spirite blest, I will not harken vnto time againe. And farewell all that may be bid farewell, Within this world of wretchednes and woe: My spirit seekes but only there to dwell, Where puer truth doth no corruption knowe. A Gowne of Veluet and a chaine of pearle, Shall now bewitche mine eyes with folly gazes When vnderneath, an idle headed girle, May feede the minde, but with dishonor's mazes. The seate of power too neere the Sin of pride, Shall with Ambition, not infect my minde: A ioyfull peace, within my soule hath tride, The sweetest life is in the meane to finde. The filéd tongue of fayning eloquence: Shall now no more abuse my simple trust: In yea and nay, I finde that excellence, Where perfect iudgements cannot prooue vniust. The sound of warre shal not inchaunt mine ear With honour's musicke, to abuse my heart: The blesséd peace, that patient spirits beare, In heauenly consortes haue no bloudy parte. The long delaying studdie of the lawe, Shall beate no hammers in my wearie braine, Nor loose my Corne in striuing for a strawe, But keepe my right, &amp; hate a wrongfull gaine. The greedie labours, of the grumbling Chuffe, I will not followe, for a rusty wealth: But in discretion thinke that worke enough, That cloathes the flesh, and keepes the soule in health. And I wil leaue Court, Cittie, towne and fielde, Warres, Lawe and traffique, pollycie and paine: And see what life the country loue will yeelde, Where Shepheards keepe the flockes vpon the plaine. There will I sit and in the sacred sence, Of heauenly vertues high instructions: Learne in Aglaias nature's excellence, Of Loue's conceites, to make the best constructions. Where God alone shall in my soule be loued, And faithe's affection in true fancy proued. Which done, my heart shall lie vpon my brest, That truth shall shewe the secret of my thought: Where patience prooues the spirit onely blest, That lookes at heauen and sets the world at nought. Thus will I sit, and set my pipe in tune, And plaie as merry as the day is long: And as in Aprill, so againe in Iune, Fit both my spring, and haruest with a song. My Pipe shall bee but of a dainty reede, That growes within the Riuer of delight: Where euerie stop shall stand my heart in steed, To guide the spirrit of my musicke right. And for my ditties, they shall be diuine: When time shall onely on Aglaia rest, While fancy so shall euerie note refine, That euerie passion shall be well exprest. And when the Musicke of my pipe is done, Then what is needefull to my flocke goe see: And from the plant that prospers in the Sunne, Cut of the succors least they spoyle the tree. And then goe looke vnto the worme and flie, That may annoy my Lambkins, or their Dambes, And to each griefe such presente helpe apply, As may preserue the smallest of my Lambes. And if I see the Wolfe, the Brocke, the Foxe, Or any varmin stealing downe a furrowe: To make a praye among my prettie flocke, Send out my Dog, and beate him to his borough. And when I heare the Nightingale recorde, The Musicke, wherein Nature pleaseth Arte: To trie how loue can with her tune accorde, To sound the passions of a painting hearte: And when that shee her warbling Tunnes doth ease, And shades her selfe from parching sommer's heate, Then learne of her, how I may holde my peace, While lesser Birdes, the idle ayre doe beate: And when I sit vpon that sweetest mountaine, Where growes the grasse, that feedes my fairest flockes, And there beholde, that Christall cleerest fountaine, That sendes her streames distilling through the Rockes. And seeing there the heartes-ease growing by it, The onely flower of fancie's best affection: And thinke how Nature in her pride doth die it: To put downe painting in her Arte's prefection. Then lift mine eye vnto that hande on high, That worketh all thinges by his holy will: And giue all glory to this Maiestie: Whose onely wisdome shewes all wonder skill. Then on the earth fall humbly on my face, And pray to him that made both day and night: First to inspire me with his holy grace, And then to blesse me in Aglaia's light. And when I see the Trees beginne to Bud, And euerye grasse, put foorth his fairest greene, And euerie kidde begin to chew the Cudde, And Flora haunt it like a Medowe Queene. And all the Muses, dresse vp all their bowers, And set their Consorts in so high a Key: As if they met in Musicke's sweetest powers, To play and sing some Princely Roundelay. Then still againe vnto my God on high, Giue all due prayse, who in his grace hath prooued, Aglaia blesséd in his gratious eye: That so doth liue of Creatures all beloued. The description and praise of his fairest Loue. Sonet. 2. Vp on the Hill of happinesse, In beautie's Gratious blessednes: Bonerto's fairest Shepheardesse, In wisdome's honors worthinesse: Aglaia liues, long may shee liue, The worth that doth this wonder giue. An Eye in which faire beautie's light, Hath none of Phœbus' killing sight: But of a farre more heauenly Grace, To warme the heart, not burne the face: A fore-head that faire fronte of blisse, That shewes where beautie gracéd is. A Haire that holdes the heart's affections, Euen by the eye of lawe's directions: Which wauing finely in the ayre, Describes the pride of Beauties faire, While loue beholdes with vertue's eye, There doth not lye a hayre awrie. A cheeke the chaine of loue's best chaunce, That pleaseth passion in his Traunce: A lippe to loue, more kindely sweete, Then Hiues where Hony-Bees do meete. A breath that so the ayre perfumes, As all corruptious sence consumes. And for her teeth, no Granam studdes, Nor like the Knagges of Blacke-thorne buddes: But where conceites, are kindely met, Like Orient Pearles, in Rubies set. And for a Toung in reason's sence, The Trumpet of true eloquence. And for a wit in wisdome's will, So gouernéd with gracious skill: That Admiration best can tell, Where excellence doth truely dwell. And for a spirite to that wit: The world too weake to iudge of it. I speake not of inferiour partes, Nor of their prayses due desartes: I rather loue my thoughts to raise, To blesséd spirits and their prayse. And where the best is set before: But name Aglaia and no more. But if I had the painter's Arte, To set a glasse on euery parte, Her necke should seeme a piller fit, For to vpholde the state of wit. Whose smoothnesse would amase his sight: When he should sit to paint the white. Her Brestes should be those Balles of blisse, That loue and beautie neuer misse, But if a stroke doe chaunce to fall: The heart should answere for the ball. While honor's eye should iudge the set, What loue may loose, and vertue get. Her armes should be those Angell bowes, That blesséd wisdome onely knowes: Her fingers, shaftes; that where they light, Doe kill the eyes of idle sight: While honor so guides Nature's eye: There can no feather flye awry. Her belly should that mountaine be, That may put downe Parnassus hill: Where Pallas might reioyce to see, The subiects of her sweetest skill, While all her Muses might deuise, To judge of Nature's paradise. But for that Marke of Modesty, That sweares the silence of conceite: While that descretion's carefull eye, Is caried but to honor's height. A Moone Eclipséd should descrie, The daunger of a wickéd Eye. Now for the nexte adioyning Limmes, Where strength and straightnes both agree, To showe how nature sweetely trimmes, All partes wherein her prayses be: Should Sampson's pillers figure plaine, How all Philistians should be slaine. Now for her legges, her knees and feete, Which so euen carry euerie parte: That beautie, loue, and honor meete. To show the pride of Nature's arte: I would but as I saide before, But make her picture and no more. But painting is too poore a skill, Where colours can but shadowe showe The Poet's wit too weake for will: To speake of that he doth not knowe, While onely Admiration Must make her declaration. And how shall I then silly swaine, Once looke at such a pure aspect? As but vertues gratious vaine, My rudenes neuer would respect, But rather leaue the lonely spring, Then stay to heare the Shepheard sing. Alas I know not, this is all, I hope but from a hill of grace: When heauenly fates will fauour fall, A gratious heart, a gathering place. Where I some little crum shall finde. That may refresh a woeful minde. Till when, and then, and euermore, I will be but her Shepheard swaine; And for my seruice seeke no more: But on Petharé's Mountaine plaine, I may one leaue my flocke to keepe, And folde my Lambes, and feede my sheepe. At Shearing time she shall commaund, The finest fleece of all my wooll: And if her pleasure but demaund, The fattest from the leane to cull. She shall be mistresse of my store: Let mee alone to worke for more. My cloake shall lie vpon the ground, From wet and dust to keepe her feete: My pipe with his best measure's sound, Shall welcome her with musicke sweete. And in my skrippe, some cates at least: Shall bid her to a Shepheard's feast. My staffe shall stay her, in her walke, My dog shall at her heeles attend her: And I will holde her with such talke, As I doe hope shall not offend her, My Eawes shall bleate, my Lambes shall play, To shew her all the sport they may. Why I will tell her twentie thinges, That I haue heard my mother tell: Of plucking of the Buzzard's winges, For killing of her Cockerell, And hunting Rainard to his denne, For frighting of her sitting Hen. How shee would say, when shee was young, That Louers were ashamde to lie: And truth was so on euerie tongue, That Loue ment naught but honestie. And Sirra (quoth shee) then to me Let euer this thy lesson be. Looke when thou louest, loue but one, And let her worthy be thy loue: Then loue her in thy heart alone, And let her in thy passions prooue, Aglaia all that in thy minde, Within thy heart her loue shali finde. And as shee bad, I haue obeyed, I loue in heart but one alone: Whose worthines my wits dismaid, In finding such a worthy one. As in Aglaia all doth prooue, All under heauen my only loue. And in that loue to liue and die, And die, but in that loue to liue: And loue that cannot liue to lie, Shall for my truth this warrant giue: My life or death, to saue or lose, Shall in her loue be to dispose. Her eyes shall be my Sunne to guide me, Her hand shall holde me by the hearte, Her censure onely shall decide me: What I protest in euerie parte. In heart to serue and loue her so, As vnder heauen to loue no moe. And if all this will not suffice, To make her knowe an honest care, Then shall shee see before her eyes, Of what true forces passions are. When silence discontent shall prooue, How death shall make an ende of loue. And yet before that finall houre, Where passions play their latest parte, When sweetes are seuer'd, from their sower, While onely life is in the heart: The last effect of loue to trie, I will but make my will and die. And I will tell her such fine tales, As for the nonce, I will deuise: Of Lapwinges and of Nightingales: And how the Swallow feedes on flies. And of the Hare, the Fox, the Hound, The Pastor and the Medow ground. And of the springes, and of the wood, And of the Forrestes and the Deere, And of the riuers and the floods, And of the mirth and merrie cheere, And of the lookes and of the glaunces, Of Maides and young men in their daunces: Of clapping handes, and drawing gloues, And of the tokens of loue's truth, And of the pretty Turtle Doues, That teach the billinge trickes of youth. And how they kindely ought to wooe, Before the tother thing they doe. Sonet. 3. Foolish loue is onely folly, Wanton Loue is too vnholly: Greedy loue is couetous, Idle loue is friuolous, But the gratious loue is it: That doth prooue the worth of wit. Beautie but deceiues the eye, Flatterie leades the eare awrye: Welth doth but inchaunt the wit, Want the ouerthrowe of it. While in wisdome's worthy Grace, Vertue sees the sweetest face. There hath loue found out his life, Peace without all thought of strife: Kindenes in discretion's care, Truth that clearely doth declare. Faith doth in true fancy prooue, Lust the excremente of loue. Then in faith my fancie see, How my loue may construéd bee, How it growes, and what it seekes, How it liues, and what it likes. So in highest grace regarde it, Or in lowest scorne discarde it. Sonet. 4. Tell mee, tell mee pretty Muse, Canst thou neither will nor chuse, But be busie with my braine, Still to put my wits to paine? Shall my heart within my brest, Neuer haue an hower of Rest? Idle humor what doth ayle thee? Not a thought that can auayle thee: Be thou neere so woe begon thee, Beautie will not looke vpon thee, Fortune wholy hath forlorne thee, And for loue, it hath forsworne thee. But if vertue haue procurd thee, And that honour haue coniur'd thee. In affection's royalty, To discharge loue's loyaltie, That the Eye of truth may see, Then doe what thou wilt for me. Worke my wit vnto thy will, Keepe thy hammers working still: Vse thine arte in euery thought, With such temper to be wrought, That Aglaia may aprooue, Vertue's skill in framing Loue. But if any labour lacke, Or if either flawe or cracke Make the mettall not so fine, That the worke be not deuine, And well fit for honour's store, Neuer come at me no more. Sonet. 5. I care not what I say nor doe, My thoughts are spent: Since no conceite can bring me to My heart's content: I cannot speake and if I coulde, It were in vaine: And yet if that I could, I would Reueale my payne. But since it is to great to showe, And I must bide it. I leaue it to remorce to knowe, How care doth hide it. And sue but to those inward eyes That see my heart, To looke on patience how she dies: In passion's smart. And say what in themselues they see, Where truth excelles: I know the heart that honours mee And loues none else. Sonet. 6. Fooles cannot know what fancie is, Where wisdome findes true wit: And who can euer ayme at blisse, That hath no thought of it. A shallow braine can neuer iudge, The sweet or sower betweene: For Vulcan was but held a drudge, While Venus was a Queene. A muddie spirite dwells in drosse, While pure affection's fire, Enflames the heart that feeles no crosse To compasse his desire. And sweetly doth conseale his griefe: Who rather dies then begges reliefe. Sonet. 7. Pe tharco, I protest, I will proclaime thy pride, And what it is. By that faire Phœnix nest, Thy little hill doth hide, In honor's blisse. Enuie shall hate the place, Where thou beholdest alone, Loue's Paradice: Vnworthy of the grace, To see that worthy one, Of Angelles eyes. And I will raise againe, The Poetes that are dead, To raile on thee: Because thou doste contriue, The spirit that hath bred, This death in me. My best fancy, flye a franzye Keepe desiring in admiring, Beautie's nature in a creature: Looue and honor looke vpon her, Bid the graces, in their places, To her beautie doe their duetie. Thinke not vainely, but all plainely: Say and sweare it, who shall heare it, She is wholy, her selfe soly. Nature's Iewell, reason's fuell, Honor's treasure, Grace's pleasure, Passions spelling, thoughts excelling. Declaration, Admiration. Sonet. 8. Poets die all: in loue's triall, Truth hath found yee, Wonders feeding, on exceeding, Doth confound yee. Weake wittes perish, what can cherrish Heart sicke fancy? Wisdome seeing, in loue's being, Reason's franzye All Intentions, and inuentions Of witte's wonder: See the creature, in worthe's nature, Keepe yee vnder. To the Phœnix, beautie's Radix, Would compare her. Leaue your writing, no enditing, And declare her. Muses' silence, to loue's essence, Doth resigne her, Loue not daring in comparing To define her. Sonet. 9. Faire faces are eyes' witches, That but inchaunt the minde: Fond humors reason's itches, That but affection blinde. While loue is but a mockery, To cheate the world with foolerie. Youth but a blaze of time, Whome Age to ashes bringes: Time but a weary chime, That death to sorrowe ringes: While wealth the weight of care doth prooue, The world hath little what to loue. Beautie is sildome wise, Nor wit hath fortune friend, And loue in Argus eyes Findes Iealouzie a fiend. While truth doth gaine so little grace, As makes the world a woefull place. And vertue is so poore, Shee liues by pittie most: While pride doth ope her doore, But onely vnto cost. And power is growne so daungerous, As makes discretion timorous. And fancie is so fickle, That faith is in mistrust: And friendship is so tickle, That judgments prooues vniust. While nature's blot in Reason's blame, Doth shew the world a wicked frame. Woordes are but blastes of breath, Thoughts but the witte's illusion: Deedes but desartes of death, All but the worlde's confusion. Where wordes and thoughts, and deedes doe trie, The worlde wrapt vp in miserie. What then on earth remaineth That reason can discouer? But that the heart disdaineth, Which is the spirit's louer. Saue that which wisdome findes in wit, Is in the worlde but none of it. For which conceal'd content, In honor's carefull chest, Wherein the spirit spent, Is onely truely blest. I will subscribe to reason's will, To liue in purgatory still. For such the worlde I finde, A place where eyes may see, What moste may glad the minde, Yet neere the better be, Because the world hath smallest parte, Of that which moste doth please the hearte. Then heauen's protest for me, In spight of worldly spight: Aglaia all shall be, Where loue in honour's light, In iudgements of discretion's eyes: Doth make the world a Paradice. For were it not thrise good, In Nature, wit, and grace: Where truth hath vnderstood, The cleerenes of my Case, My loue on earth should neuer dwell, But hate the world as halfe a hell. Then wherein goodnes showes, The grace of fancie's blisse: Which no Corruption knowes, Nor earth come where it is: Let me this true conclusion prooue, I hate the world, but for thy loue. Sonet. 10. Faire eye spill me not, Be of a better nature: Sweet woordes kill me not, But comforte a poore creature. But if yee needes will spill me, Let it bee with loue's blindenesse: And if yee needes will kill me, Let it bee with loue's kindnesse. Then shall your worth be proouéd, In prayse's high perfection: And in that prayse belouéd, In fancie's deere affection. And looue in honor's residence, Shall write but of your excellence. Sonet. 11. Pretty twinckling starry eyes, How did Nature first deuise, Such a sparkling in your sight, As to giue loue such delight, As to make him like a flye, Play with lookes vntill he die? Sure yee were not made at first, For such mischiefe to be curst: As to kill affection's care, That doth onely truth declare. Where worthe's wonders neuer wither, Loue, and Beautie liue together. Blesséd eyes then giue your blessing, That in passion's best expressing: Loue that onely liues to grace yee, May not suffer pride deface yee. But in gentle thoughte's directions, Shew the praise of your perfections. FINIS.</field>

DEVIDED INTO SEAVEN dayes Workes. AND Dedicated to the Kings most excellent Maiestie. To the High and mightie Prince Iames by the grace of God, King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, defendour of the faith, etc. The Argument. Vertue is Wisedomes light, Wisedome her loue, And Constancie her only lifes delight: Which Patience in Humility doth proue, Humility the eye of Vertues sight: That sees the Graces branches of the Tree, Which figures God, in whom their Glories be. A Poem vpon the praise of vertue. The first dayes worke. Oh my deere Muse, that neuer could'st endure The wicked courses of a wretched minde: Nor euer learn'st by cunning to procure The hatefull comforts of a hellish kinde: But, euer hast the loue of vertue neere thee, Speak in her praise, that all the world may heare thee. Goe, tell the greatest Monarch (where thou goest) She is a Queene to fit his Maiestie: And, tell the wisest Counsellour thou knowest, By her, his wit hath greatest dignitie: And, tell the fairest, in her fairest grace, Foule is her faire, except she blush her face. Tell the Diuine, she giues a glorious light, Vnto the truth of the eternall word: Tell Valour, she makes but a bloody fight, Except she guide the hand that holds the sword: Tell all the Artes, their studies are but idle, Except she hold the sences in a bridle. Tell Honour that her Title's but a tittle, Except she build the steps of her estate: Tell Riches, all her Greatnes is but little, Except she hold her Reckonings at a rate: Tell Loue, alas, his treasure's but a toy, Except she be the substance of the Ioy. Goe, tell the world more then the world can tell, All is as nought, where she's not all in all: Tell Excellence, she neuer doth excell, But, when her Grace, doth to her Glory fall: Tell Truth her selfe, that in her trumpe of Fame, Her highest Note is only in her name. Oh, were she seene within the sacred fence Of her high fauour alwaies with the highest; Where Angels Grace, and Graces excellence, Keepe her deere Loue vnto themselues the nighest; Then would the world all humbly fall before her, And, next to God, in harts and soules adore her, Oh, could a King but note her Queene-like Nature, What Maiestie is in an humble minde; How, on the earth she makes a heauenly Creature, In being louing, patient, true and kinde: And in her sweetnes, sweetly so perceiue her, No King on earth would for his Kingdom leaue her. And, could a Queene behold her Glorious Grace, How her true Loue doth truly louely make her: And what a Sunne she sets vpon her face, That makes the Godly for a Goddesse take her: She would so truly and so deerely loue her, That, no conceite should from her Court remoue her. And did the grauest wisest Counsellour, But sound the depth of her diuine conceite, Where perfect Truth is Reasons Paramour: When Wisedomes care doth cut off all deceite: While sacred Iudgement in true Iustice sits, Her will should be the Rule of all their Wits. And, could the neatest Courtier once behold How comly she is with a little cost: How farre she is from euery pleating fold, Where, fond expences are in folly lost: They all would leaue their Antike Loues desire, And, take their patternes from her plaine attire. And, did the fairest Nimph, or Noblest Maide Behold her Beauty in her glorious Brightnes, Pure in it selfe, vnspotted, not beraide: Nor, idely caried with a looke of Lightnes: They would so farre her excellence preferre, As, all would leaue themselues to follow her. And, did the most experienc't Officer, But note her cariage, in her seruice' care: Where Conscience is the true examiner Of all the thoughts, where Honours courses are: While gracious spirits dwell in earthly Natures: The Court would be a place of heauenly Creatures. Did the Diuine see her Diuinitie, And what a spouse vnto the soule she is: Who, with the world hath no affinitie, But, in the heauens hath her eternall blisse. He would his life, vnto her loue referre; And, leaue the world, for only Loue of her. And, did the Lawyer looke into her lawes; Where Truth and Loue doe trie the case of life; And wicked Craft can neuer make a clause, To feed Ambition with the fruite of strife: But, euery plea, in pitties conscience proue: All Law should onely liue, but in her loue. And, did the Souldiour, in the points of Warre, See how she sets the honour of the fight: How from offences, she doth keepe afarre, Yet, in the quarrell, doth maintaine the right: And, saues the lyues, that doe to Mercy yeeld: She should be high Commaunder of the field. She is not lockt vp in the Misers Chest, Nor, lapt vp in the lines of lewd conceite: Her life is more in liberty faire blest, Then, on the wills of wicked wit to waite: No, no, it is too much against her nature, To haue to doe with any wicked creature. When she alone doth in her Closet sit, Heauens open her the windowes of their light: And Wisedomes spirit doth inspire her wit, While holy Grace, doth guide her spirit right: Saints teares, her Inke; her pennes of Angels wings, While, to the Glory of her God she sings. Her Paper is a pure, vnspotted hart, Where thoughts are words, writ in the lines of loue: Where Patience points at sorrowes inward smart, While ruthfull passions doe Repentance proue: And, Truth records, that Graces eyes may reade, How soules are heal'd while sinfull harts doe bleede. There, all the Angels, in their turnes attend; To doe their seruice, in their purest sence; While Wit and Reason, doe their Natures bend; Vnto the life of Loues obedience: And gathering so all gracious thoughts together; She weares the Garland, that can neuer wither. There, doth she put the Poets to their pensions, Whose Wits are worne with too much worldly study, And cannot reach the height of heauens Inuentions, But, plod in pooles where plashes are too muddy: And takes a Muse for Gracious Pleasures play, To set her Musique in a heauenly Key. There, doth she sing, how sweet a thing it is, To see the heauens all blesséd thoughts embrace: How Beauty sees the highest of her Blisse, But in the feature of an Angels face: While, Time and Truth doe in their triall proue, There is no life but in the eternall Loue. The fading pleasures of Affections play, The partiall working of imperfect will: The feeble state of fickle fancies stay, The carelesse compasse of vnkindly skill: The curséd humour of Inconstancie: These hatefull humours she doth all defie. No, where she loues, it ends but with her life, And wh? she speakes, her Iudgements shewes her wit: And, when she writes, her Concords know no strife, What choise conceite shall chiefe in honour sit: But speake, and write, and looke, and like, and loue, All haue their blessings in the heauens aboue. She giues the King a high Supremacie, And, to his Queene, a Gracious Maiestie: And, to his Court she giues a Decencie, And to his State she giues an Vnitie: And, to the Rich a superfluity, And, to the poore, a bounteous charity. She giues the Scholler Vnderstanding sence, And, to the Souldiour, Resolution: And, to the Iudge an vpright Conscience, And the Repentant, Absolution: The Trades-man, care, to keepe his family, The Labourer, patience, and Humility. She leades a King into his Cabinet, And, shewes him there the burthen of his Crowne, Before his eyes she doth his Kingdom set, And to his God his duty doth set downe: She shewes him there the fall of idle pride, And, how his person doth in safety bide. She shewes him there the honour of her oue, The ground of Grace in the eternall good: She shewes the blessing of the soules behoue, Vpon the breeding of a Royall brood: And, that Religion is the Rule of Grace, That keepes the kingdome in a happy case. She shewes him there, the benefit of peace, The hurt of Warre, the hate of Tyrannie: The Ioy of Loue, the happinesse encrease: Where Wisedomes cares are Honours companie: And, sound aduise in sacred veritie, Maintaines a Monarch in his Maiestie. She shewes him there how flattery folly feedes, While Reason sees the ruine of selfe-will; She shewes the difference, twixt the herbs and weedes, Wicked illusion, and discretions skill; She shewes him all, that she thinks fit to show him, To strength his State, that nothing ouerthrow him. She shewes him there the sweet contentiue life Is not still caried in varieties; Nor faithfull Care doth feare the fatall knife, That is not subiect to Impieties: But he alone, is all, and onely Blest, Who, all in Mercy, hath his spirits Rest. She makes him see, that he could neuer see, But, through her sight, the brightnes of all Seeing; She makes him be, that he could neuer be, But in the blessing of her blessed Being: Thus, all in summe, she makes him see, and be That without her, he could not be, nor see. She gaines him all his Greatnes in her Grace, His Countries loue, the honour of his Court: She keepes him safely in his kingly place, And, to the world she doth his fame report; And, when fr? earth Death must his Crowne disseuer, She makes him raigne a King in heauen for euer. She takes a Queene vnto her selfe a-side, And, shewes her all the Glory of her Grace: How, she alone doth make the blessed Bride, And, how she keepes her in her highest place: She makes the King in glorious Robes attire her, And, all the Court, loue, honour, and admire her. Then doth she bring her humbly on her knees, And, sets before her the faire booke of Blisse, Bids her there finde that she can neuer leese, The care of life, where euery comfort is: When lifting vp her heart with humble eie, She sees a Beautie brighter then the skie. There she beholds in Mercies Maiestie, Her Sauiour sitting on a glorious Throne: Where, in the Essence of Eternitie, He rules all powers in himselfe, alone: When, seeing her thus humbly fall before him, He blesseth her that doth so much adore him. Then, doth she see the Angels exercise, Who, with the Saints and Virgins sit and sing: While humble spirits make their Sacrifice, Vnto the Glory of their Gracious King: While, all the Hoast of all the heauen reioyces, To heare the Musique of the heauenly voyces. Then, doth she set the Consort of the Quier, Where euery Note doth keepe his Tune and Time: The ditty only speaking of Desire, Where, loue doth only vnto Mercy clime: Where euery Close doth in such comfort meete, That all the Heauens are rauisht with the sweete. She takes the Virgine to her Morning taske, And sets her downe a forme of faithfull praier: But, couers not her Beauty with a Maske, When she hath made her truly heauenly faire: But, brings her forth with such a Blessed Grace, As, makes him happy that may see her face. She shewes her in a Glasse of Beauties Truth, How, Art doth Nature too much iniurie; That feebled Age in forcéd tricks of Youth, In true Conceite is Reasons Mockerie; The idle thoughts that spoile the inward eies, Where Loue should liue, but in dishonour dies. She shewes her there the Maiden-blush complection, Betwixt the cherrie Red, and snowie White: And, reades her then the precepts of perfection, Within the circle of Dianas sight. She shewes her all the Titles of desart, And, that true honour liues but in the hart. She neuer taught the Eye to leere nor lowre, Tongue, idle talke; nor minde, vngratious thought: She neuer set a countenance sharpe and sowre, Nor, fetch't a sigh vpon a thing of nought: But, shewes her Iudgement of so iust a Measure, As, proues her Wisedome worth a world of Treasure. She shewes her then, how Fancie like a Flea, Can skip about a skittish humour'd hart: And, how that sorrow like the Ocean Sea, Can drowne the spirit in a deadly smart: While Melancholy doth oppresse the Minde, Where better humours haue no place to finde. Then, doth she take the Counsailour alone, And, shewes him all the secrets of his hart, Bids him behold the Mournfull Widowes moane, The Orphanes teares, the grieuéd Sutors smart: Loue, feare, and serue, first God, and then his King, And, doe no worke that may his Conscience wring. She tells him then, the heau'nly Consistorie Doth only sit vpon the spirits good: Where, in the sight of sacred Wisedomes eie, Cannot a clawse amisse be vnderstood: While, Truth it selfe, that pleads the poore mans case, From Mercies Iustice hath impartiall Grace. Then, doth she take aside the Courtier, And, shewes him all the fruites of idlenes; That, fancie is but follies Treasurer, While Wit is thrall vnto vnthriftines: While Pride presuming on deceiuing Hope, Griefe doth the Gate but to Repentance ope. She tells him there she neuer taught the eye To feede the spirit with an idle Gaze: She neuer taught the tongue to walke awrie, Nor, brought the minde into a wilfull Maze: She neuer taught the fashion, nor the cost, Where, Wisedome sees time, and expence but lost. She neuer teacheth to play fast and loose, Nor, iuggle with a false conceiuèd Ioy: Nor, let the Foxe be taken by a Goose, Nor, euer sold a treasure for a toy: She neuer taught him to misspend his time, Nor higher state then his desert to clime. She neuer taught him how to crouch, nor creepe, Nor scorne, nor scoffe, nor hang the head a-side: Nor sigh, nor sob, nor wipe the eye, and weepe, Nor hatefull thoughts in louing lookes to hide: No, no, she is of a more heauenly Nature, Then, with such by-wit to abuse a Creature. Then, doth she call for euery Officer, And bids him strictly looke into his Oath, That, Conscience may be true deliuerer Of an vnspotted, simple faith, and troth: That seruice loue by duties care discharged, In Honours eye make due Reward enlarged. Then, doth she take account of his accounts, How, all the summes doe with the parcels gree: And, how much cunning Conscience surmounts, And, what in fine, the finall summe will be: And, tells him that a counting day will come, When he shall make account for all and some. Thus, when she hath the Courtiers all reade ouer, She calls the Lawyer to a conscience case, And, tells him, Truth is Learnings only Louer, Who, neuer puts the poore Man out of place: But, holds the hand of Iustice weight so euen, As if the Ballance had the Beame in Heauen. She neuer takes a Bribe to make a Motion, Nor, soothes a client in a false Conceite; She neuer seekes an vndeseru'd promotion, Nor sells her Beauty vnto the poore by weight; No, she is true, and iust, and wise, and kinde, And as she thinks, will euer speake her minde. Then doth she take the Souldiour in his Tent, And shewes him there the hideous sight of blood: That, Mercy euer with true valour went, To spoile the wicked, but to spare the good: That, Conquest neuer is in true perfection, But when a Man can Maister his Affection. She teacheth not a wicked Stratagem, Nor, how for Coine to buy and sell a Towne: Nor to vsurpe a princely Diadem, Nor raise the vile, nor put the vertuous downe: No, when she once begins to leuie Armes, The good haue Grace, the only wicked harmes. She neuer prai'd vpon the poore Man's purse, Nor tyraniz'd vpon the Prisoner: She neuer reap't the Mournfull Widowes Curse, Nor of an Infant was a Murtherer: She neuer was by Sea nor Land a Thiefe, But had Compassion on the poore Mans griefe. Thus hauing shew'd the Souldiour what she knowes, Becomes the cariage of a Noble Minde: She calls the Merchant, and to him she showes, That, Conscience care is of a heauenly kinde: While no corruption can the soule infect, That to the spirit hath a due respect. She shewes him there, there is no ware, nor weight, But the all-Seeing-Eye in secret sees, And, that no cunning can excuse deceite, Which gaining drosse, doth better siluer leese: She tells him plaine it is ill gotten gaine, For fading pleasure gets eternall paine. She tells him, that the aduenture on the Sea, Is not all blest to enrich the couetous: Nor to maintaine the Epicure his Ease, The proud, the bad, nor the vitious: But, to prouide for neede, and to relieue The needy hart, whom griping want doth grieue. In some, she shewes him that the spirits wealth, Is free from all vnconscionable ill: And, howsoeuer, Wit doth worke by stealth, There is no Wisedome but the Gratious will: Where carefull Loue, where Comfort neuer wasteth, Laies vp the Treasure that for euer lasteth. Then, doth she call on euery Trade and Art, And, still cries out, haue care of Conscience: Bids euery eye, looke well into the hart, And, not be caried with a wicked sence: For, in the day of the eternall Doome, Plainenes in heauen will haue a princely Roome. What, though sometime her habite be but poore, Her lodging hard, her diet spare and thinne: She stand disgracéd at the rich mans doore, And fast without, while other feast within: Yet, is she better with her Crosse contented, Then, sport with sinnes, to haue her soule tormented. And, though sometime she sit and hold her peace, While, idle heads doe vse their tongues at large: And, grieue to see true Learnings worth decrease, When that a Dunce doth take a Doctors charge; Yet, may the world in all her courses know, 'Tis not her will, God knowes, it shall be so. And, though sometime she be in fetters tied, While wicked spirits walke at liberty, And, be enforc'd her fairest thoughts to hide, While hatefull thoughts are had in Dignitie: Yet hath she patience to endure her crosses, While heau'nly gaine doth counteruaile her losses. Oh, could the world discerne her worthines, In all true honour, in all honours truth: How she doth only giue a happines Vnto the grauest Age, and greenest Youth: Euen from the King, vnto the poorest Creature, She would be honour'd in a heau'nly Nature. But, let the world esteeme her as it will, She shall be worth more then the world is worth: And, when the world shall blush to see her ill, Then shall she bring her heauenly Beauty forth: And make them all confesse vnto their faces, Her Glory puts them all vnto disgraces. She neuer speakes but Truth, nor doth but well, Her thoughts all pure, and grounded on perfection: She doth among the holy Muses dwell, And guides the Graces, all by her direction: She is the Bodies Grace, the spirits Queene, In whom all Graces haue their Glory seene. Oh, that I could describe her in her height, As God and her good Grace might giue me leaue: How all the Saints, and all the Angels waite, But on her will, and from the same receiue The highest substance of their heau'nly Blisse, In whom alone all heau'nly Blessing is. Then should the world be all asham'd to see, How basely they her glorious Grace regarded: And grieue in soules to thinke that euer she Should for her seruice be so ill rewarded: That few or none, wise, fond, nor rich, nor poore, But ready are to thrust her out of doore. Then should the Courts of Princes flock vnto her, And Lords and Ladies sue to her for Grace: And happy soules that best can seruice doe her, And seeke their life but in her louely face: And then her Grace, such should a glory beare, That there should be no world but where she were. But since her worth is to the world vnknowne, And only Heauen doth her deere Loue embrace: Her worth is more then can in words be showne, While Grace it selfe can only shew her Grace: Let me but leaue her in all Admiration, To Virgins, Saints, and Angels Adoration. And let me say but what in soule I finde: She is the essence of all Excellence: The Eie, the Heart, the Body, and the Minde, Where holy Rules haue all their Residence: Of all good Motions the first only Mouer, The proofe of loue, and of Loue's proofe the Louer. The strength of Truth, th' assurance of all Trust, The Concordance of all contentiue care: The Iudgement of the Wisedome of the Iust, The sacred shop of the Celestiall ware: The Iemme for which no price can be too great, Th' Eternall Manna for the spirits Meate. The Eie of light, where Loue hath all his life, The tong of Truth, where Wisedom hath her words: The heart of peace, where patience knowes no strife, The hand of Bounty that all Grace affords: The face of Beauty where all Brightnes shineth, The soule of wonder that all words defineth. The soile wherein all sweetnes euer groweth, The Fountaine where all Wisedome euer springeth: The winde that neuer but all blessing bloweth, The Aire that all comfort euer bringeth: The fire that euer life with Loue enflameth, The figure that all true perfection frameth. The study of the soules Intelligence, The Art of Wisedomes high Inuention: The Rule of Reasons best Experience, The worke of Mercies Glorious Mention: The ground of Honour, and discretions Grace, Place's perfection, and perfection's place. All this, and more then I can speak or write, In Vertue liues, and to her loue belongs: And, though the world doe barre her of her right, Yet heauen will one day right her of her wrong. And make the world to know her gratious Nature, And, how she only makes the Glorious Creature. And, since that day will one day come vnwares, When she will call a Court of all her Teanures, And, see the fruite of all her seruants wares, And, take an order for all Misdemeanures: Let all the world be fearefull to offend her, And thinke them happy that can best attend her. Let euery Creature seeke and sue to serue her, And euery King, and Lord, and Lady loue her: And euery heart endeuour to deserue her, And euery Minde for some good Motion moue her: And euery tongue in true perfection praise her, And euery soule to endlesse Glory raise her. And let me aske a pardon of heau'ns Grace, For my poore spirits mounting vp so high: Who, for my sinnes doth bid me hide my face, And not to heau'n to dare to lift mine eie: And say no more, but end as I began, She is a Queene of Queenes, and I haue done. And since that Vertue neuer can be seene, But by the Eie of Wisedomes sacred sence: Where she beholds her as the Blessed Queene, That weares the Crowne of Reasons excellence: Let me beseech the Heauens my soule to Raise, To speake of Wisedome in her worthy praise. And, though I know, and cannot but confesse My thoughts vnable to aspire so high, And euery way but all vnworthinesse In me, to write of such a Misterie: Yet let my heart a little tell my Minde, What wonder worth, in Wisedomes works I finde. Gloria in excelsis Deo. Vpon the praise of Wisedome. The second daies worke. From the vaine humours of vnseason'd Wit, Whose heedlesse wil breeds nothing els but woe: Among the seats where sacred spirits sit, The holy pleasures of the heauens to know: My humble Muse learne what perfection saies, In Glorious Wisedomes neuer ending praise. She is the spirit of the highest power, The Essence of all purenes' Excellence: The compasse of the euerlasting hower, The Vertue of all purenes' Quintessence: The knowledge that all knowledge only giueth, And only life, in which, life only liueth. She sits in counsaile with the Trinitie, And is th' Almighties secret Secretarie: She keepes the Graces in an Vnitie And doth the charge of all their seruice carie: Before Creation she did make Election, And for the Action she did giue direction. She calls the Angels each one by their names, And sets the Saints and Martirs in their places: Their Himnes and Songs vnto their Lord she frames, And to their Musique giues especiall Graces: The Seraphins she makes to clap their wings, While all the heauens their Haleluiah sings. Amid the skie she set the Sunne and Moone, And made diuision twixt the day and night: She made the morning and the after noone, And set each planet in his place aright: She prickt the Starres vpon the Firmament, And gaue a life to euery Element. She made the times and seasons of the yeare, The change of Natures, and the notes of choise: She made perfection euery way appeare, And in her labours made her Loue reioyce: So by desert the highest did her call High Officer, and workeMistris of all. She made the Earth in compasse like a Ball, Betwixt the water and the skie depending: Yet hangs so fast, that it can neuer fall, Vntill all earthly things must haue an ending: And hauing fram'd it as she thought it meete Made it a footstoole for her Master's feete. She made the Seas, the Brooks, the Fountaine springs: The Trees, the Fruites, the Herbs, and euery Flower: The Fish, the Beast, and euery Bird that sings: The Yeere, the Month, the Week, the day, the hower: The outward shape, and euery inward sence, And euery Starre a sundry influence. She framèd Man, the last of euery Creature, But yet the best, and to her loue the neerest: She gaue his hart a kind of heau'nly nature, And held his life vnto her loue the deerest: She made him all things by their names to call, And vnder God, Lord Gouernour of all, She taught him only how to know the good, But neuer taught him how to know the euill: She fed his spirit with a wholesome food, Till Pride did bring him poyson from the Deuill: She made him then his folly to confesse, And then his faith in Mercy finde redresse. She gaue his soule a Minde aboue his Hart, His Hart, a feeling of his spirits Nature: His Nature, Reason; and his Reason, Art; His Art, a knowledge of his earthly Creature: His Knowledge, Honour, and his Honour, Grace, His Grace a fauour, in a Glorious place. She read him all the Rules of Learnings Loue, The Naturall, the Morall, and Diuine: She show'd the Blessing of the soules behoue, That doth not wholy to the earth decline: She shewes the way vnto eternall Blisse, And, for the world, how base a thing it is. Yet when she made the world for her best Grace, She sets a Course, and Rule for euery thing: For Nature, Reason, Action, Time, and Place, How best proportion might perfection bring: And, how in all might all things so agree, That in their Concords, might no discord be. In scale and feather, haire, and skinne, and hue, In substance, sence, in colour, shape, and feature: How they were first begot, and how they grew, And how each one should differ in their Nature: Yet, differing so, they might together liue, That none might other hurt or hinderance giue. But vnto Man, she only gaue a minde, To looke into the life of euery Nature: And giue them names, and vse them in their kinde, And take commandement of each kind of Creature: And by her will to walke among them so, That euery one should him their seruice owe. She made each haire, each Artir, and each vaine, The flesh, the bones, the sinnowes, and the skinne: The heart, the lytes, the liuer, and the braine; The outward Beauty, and the strength within: And to his soule did giue that heau'nly Nature, That made in all the admirable Creature. She gaue him wings to mount aboue the winde, And inward Eies to see aboue the Sunne: And by her Rules did make his Reason finde, How Sun, and Moone, and Starres their courses runne: How Sea-men by the pole their courses guide, And by the Moone the turne of euery Tide. She makes him finde the Heauens operations, Vpon the Bodies of the earth below: She makes him by his spirits contemplations Vpon the earth, things aboue Earth to know: And to his knowledge doth that Vertue giue, As learnes him only to his God to liue. She makes a difference in the Mindes of Men, She crownes the Prince, and entituleth Honor: She writes their Stories with a perfect Pen, And doth aduaunce them that doe tend vpon her: She makes them Blest that doe in patience proue her, And liue for euer that doe truly loue her. She doth instruct the King in all his care, Where Mercies Iustice beares a blesséd sword: She shewes the Peeres when they in counsaile are, What fauour heau'ns the faithfull hearts afoord: She shewes the people the due loyaltie, That Subiects owe vnto their Soueraigntie. She makes the Courtier not misspend his time, She bids the Souldiour spare the Innocent; And the Diuine beware the Conscience crime, And makes the Lawyer a good Studient: She makes the Merchant honest with his wealth, And, labour keepe the labouring Man in health. She teacheth euery Science, and each Art, And shewes the Truth of euery Argument: And makes distinctions vpon euery part, And is of all the only Ornament: She shewes the Studient in Diuinitie, Heauen with the world hath no Affinitie. She feedes no fancie with an idle fashion, Yet fashions all things in a comly frame: She neuer knew Repentance wofull passion, Nor euer fear'd the blot of wicked blame: But euen and true whateuer she intended, Wrought all so well, that none could be amended. She neuer whirles about an idle Wit, Nor taketh pleasure in a wanton Eie: Nor in the seate of pride did euer sit, Nor from the poore did turne her hand awrie: Nor maintain'd wealth with wretched Miserie, Nor sought for honour by Indignitie. No, no, that Man that would his Mistris make her, That Woman that doeth choose her for her Louer: That Man or Woman that doth only take her For their best Loue, and in their hearts doe loue her: In rauisht sweetnes of her Beauties Blisses, Will dwell vpon her lips in louely Kisses. She neuer yet did harme to any liuing, Nor was there any good but that she doeth: To euery soule she is her Comfort giuing; And with her sweetnes so Affection woeth, That they who could in Loues perfection proue her, Would hate them selues, and if they did not loue her. She laies the lines of life in Vertues loue, Imploies the Minde in holy Meditations: The hart in study of the soules behouve, The spirit, in Loues Contemplations: The tongue, in speaking truth on euery part, The soule, in prayer, for a faithfull hart. She neuer was acquainted with Corruption, Nor came within the Aire of all Infection: Her purpose neuer had an Interruption, Nor euer was she crost in her direction: But sound and sure she carries so her skill, That in all good, there can be found no ill. She is the fairest of all Beauties Fame, She is the sweetest of all Reasons sence: She is the Noblest of all Honours name, She is the strongest of all Loues defence: She is the richest of all earthly Treasure, And purest substance of the Spirits pleasure. Oh what can there be more? that she should be? Or, how should she be more than that she is? That all may see, and more then all may see, The Blessed Being of all Being Blisse: All Infinite, in all perfections waies, And Infinite, in all perfections praise. And, being then in goodnes all so Good; As, being best, a better cannot be: Which, in her selfe is only vnderstood, And in her selfe, her selfe can only see: What life of Grace? but would in loue admire her, Or Gratious loue could liue, and not desire her? But since that loue is the true life indeede, Of which she is, by which she only liueth: From which she hath her only happy spide, To which she oweth all the good she giueth; Let me the purest of my passion proue, To see her Glory in the Grace of loue. THE PRAISE OF Loue. The third daies worke. O loue that liuest in that only light, Which giues all seeing to all gratious Eies: But keepest thy sence fr? that vngodly sight, That in the darknes of illusion dies: Lighten my soule that it may cleerely see, How thou in Wisedome, Wisedome liues in thee. The Angels can in their Attonements tell, How kindly thou do'st make them liue together: And where the Saints and holy Martirs dwell, The holy Muses bring their Musique thither: And while the Hoast of all the Heauens reioyce, Thou tun'st the heart strings of the highest voice. Loue is the Essence of Eternitie, That workes the course of Wisedomes cariage: Where the high counsaile of the Deitie, Twixt Heauen and Earth doe make a Mariage: While in the life of Holines alone, The Lord of Heauen, and his true Church are one. It layes the plot, and drawes the lines of pleasure, Within the ground of Graces Paradise: It works the Truth, that is the spirits Treasure, And builds the height of Honours Dignities: It bends the Eies of Graces Royaltie, And knits the hearts of Vertues Loyaltie. It is no Obiect for an earthly Eie, Nor any Muse for any worldly minde: Although the world in true effects may trie, It is a spirit of a powerfull kinde; And such a power, as all powers doe submit, To the Inuincible power of it. It maketh Will doe only what it list, While Wisedome guides the Axill Tree of wit: And neuer feares the hurt of had I wist, That sees a Crosse, and is content with it: While patience findes the only faire perfection, Of Fancies faith, in fauours true Affection. It is a substance that admits no figure For in it selfe it breedes but of exceedings While in the Notes of pleasures truest Nature, The fruites of Faith are Fancies only feedings: While in conceite those high Contentments meete, That happy soules are rauisht with the sweete. To comprehend, it passeth Comprehension, And to define, 'tis vndefinable: And to describe, it doth exceede Inuention, And to conceiue, 'tis vnconceiuable: Yet by the Vertue that our sence it giues, Our Reason findes that in our soules it liues. It is a fire that kindleth in the Eie, It is an Aire that cooleth Furies heate: It is a water that is neuer drie, A Paradise, where growes the spirits meate; Thus it partakes of euery Element, Yet liues aboue the highest Firmament. It is a thought begotten by a sight, And 'tis a sight that liueth in the thought; It is a life that breedeth in delight, And a delight that life hath only wrought; It is a word that by true spirits spoken, Doth knit a knot that neuer can be broken. Oh how it doth a blessed Nature nourish, And how it doth a humble spirit cherish: And how it makes a faithfull heart to flourish, And suffers not a Gratious soule to perish: Witnes those hearts whose perfect spirits proue, How loue in Wisedome, Wisedome liues in loue. Fortune can neuer haue a force to foile it, Nor feare to fright, nor enuie to anoy it; Nor passion to hurt, impatience to spoile it, Nor Death to kill, nor Deuill to destroy it: But where all pleasures spring and perish neuer, Heere, or in Heau'n it hath a life for euer. From the faire Brightnes of a Beautious Eie, It carries honour to an humble hart: And from the heart of Truthes Humilitie, It gaines the comfort of a kinde desart: And in true kindnes that content alone, That of two Bodies make the Minde but one. It brought downe Heaun to Earth, brings Earth to Heau'n, It walks about the circle of the Sunne: It makes the Planets keepe their orders eu'n, And Nature kindly all her courses runne: It sits vpon the holy seate of Grace, And with the highest, hath the highest place. It keepes all Order, measure, Rule, and Right, In Nature, Reason, Wisedome, Wit, and Sence: In word and deede, and thought, by day and night, In time and place, in Case, and Moode, and Tense: Where all proportions are in such perfection, As shewes the depth of the diuine direction. It makes the husband kinde vnto his wife, The spouse obedient to her faithfull pheere: And in that kindnes that contentiue life, That only doth but in that life appeare: The Children gratious, and the Parents kinde, And each in other what they wished to finde. Brethren and sisters liue in Vnitie, And Neighbours liue in friendly Neighbourhood: And friends continue in true Amitie, And strangers vnto strangers to doe good: Princes in Peace, and Subiects liue in Grace And so the earth to proue a heau'nly place. Oh, how it fights against infamous thought, And kills the Nature of an ill coniecture: How true it hath the life of Vertue taught, And builds the height of Honours Architecture: How little it regards all earthly toyes, And surely leades the soule to endlesse ioyes. How sweetly on the Nurses lips it lies, While she is bussing of her little Baby: And how it twinckles in the Infants eies, In learning of his Christes Crosse, and his A. B: How cherry-red it dies a snowie white, Where Maiden blushes make a blessed sight. Loue makes the Triumphes of the truest ioyes And sounds the trumpet of the sweetest sound: Loue speakes in hearts, and makes no idle noise, But is in some of euery Grace the ground: It is a Riddle aboue Reasons sence, And of exceeding all the excellence. It makes the thought, the word and deede all one, It bindes the eye, the hand, and heart together: It is in truth the only Tree alone, Which keeps his greene where not a leafe can wither: It is the Bird that only sings in May, And makes the holy spirits holy day. It takes away the tediousnes from time, The paine from patience, in desire delaies: The feare from care, the hearts content to clime, The sloath from labour in his hardest waies: The frailty from the Nature of Affection, And folly from the passion of perfection. It is a Vertue of that sacred sence, In working wonders in the spirits power: As in the height of Reasons Excellence, Vpon the top of Truths eternall Tower: Doth stand with such a Grace of heau'nly Glory, As may be call'd the state of Wisedomes story. And since it is so infinite in worth, As doth exceede the penne of Reasons praise: Who from the soule of Wisedome issues forth, As from the Sunne his brightest shining Raies: Let me heere cease, and all in Admiration, Set it to Wisedomes only declaration. And since it doth in nothing more appeare, Then in the Nature of true Constancie: Which is a Vertue to the soule so deere, As keepes the soule from Errors Extasie; Let me a little speake of that sweet Nature, Of Constancie that makes the blessed Creature. THE PRAISE OF Constancie. The fourth daies worke. O constancie, thou only kingly thought, That keepes the spirit in her purest kinde: And hast against all idle frailty fought, And like a Mountaine setlest fast the Minde: Let me conceiue some part of thy content, Where pleasures spirit is most sweetly spent. And though I cannot reach that Royall height, Wherein thy sacred Maiestie doth sit: Yet as a Seruant let me humbly waite, To see thine honour, and to speake of it; And so to speake, that all the world may see Wisedome, Loue, Honor only liues in thee. The constant Eie hath neuer wandring sight, The constant Eare hath no vnkindly hearing: The constant Tongue doth euer speake aright, The constant Heart hath euer happy chearing: The constant Minde the fairest thoughts vnfold thee, The constant Soule on earth and heauen behold thee. It neuer hath a thought of iealousie, Nor stands vpon Opinions Paradox: Nor runnes a fury into frenzie, Nor feares the Wolfe, nor joyneth with the Fox: But like the Phœnix in a sunnie fire, Findes lifes delight in ashes of desire. It loues no change, and breedes the ioy of choise, It feares no fortune, nor it serues no folly: It keepes the rule where Reason doth reioice, And is the substance of contentment wholy: It is a stay that strengtheneth the Minde, And knits the sences in a sacred Kinde. It is the true foundation of all strength Which while it holds, the frame can neuer fall: It is the line that drawes the longest length, And euer is, that sees the end of all: It keeps the Rules of heau'ns reuolution. And doth confirme all Reasons resolution. It is the locke vpon the heart of loue, A Chest that keepes the treasure of the Minde: Within the soule a Rocke that cannot moue A Band, that doth the thoughts together binde. A light where Wisedome Vertues honour seeth And life where only Grace with loue agreeth. It keepes the Sunne in his continuall brightnes, The ayre in coolenes, and the earth in drynesse: Water in moisture, and the winde in lightnesse The fire in hotnes, and the flame in highnesse: The good in goodnes, and the kinde in kindnes, The minde from madnes, and the eye from blindnes: It was the mouer first of mariage, And made the first continuance of content: It set the course of Wisedomes cariage, And neuer further then affection went: It is the state of all perfections stay, And Times all euerlasting holy day. It is the Crowne of Patience kingly care, The seate where Mercy sits in Maiestie: The Law wherein all blessed precepts are, The fame of Loue and League of Amitie: The learning of the wisest wits instruction, And sence of the most sweetest thoughts construction. Aboue the Heauens it liueth with the highest, And in the Heauens it dwelleth with the purest: And to the Nature of the best the nighest, And in the sence of all conceits the surest: And in the Action of all Art the strongest, And in the length of Time, and Truth the longest. It keepes the center of the earth from mouing The swelling Sea from passing of his Bounds: The Rules of true perfection from Reprouing. The health of Wisedome from all follies Wounds; The circle of the World in such a frame, That Admiration may commend the same. Oh, how it writes the worthinesse of those That stroue for honour to the stroke of death: And how without comparison it showes, The mouth of Wisedome blessed in her breath: And how it makes the fame of them to flourish That with their Bounty vertuous spirits nourish. It is the Mirror of all Martirdome, And in the faithfull makes a Glorious fight: And in the day of the Eternall doome, It will be Gratious in all Glorious sight: Where hopes continuance in all kindnes care, Brings humble faith to endlesse happy fare. And since it is so infinite a Grace, As may deserue as infinite a praise: And is the fulnesse of the fairest place, In all the walke of Wit, and Reasons waies: Where patience proues the best experience, Let me a little sing of Patience. THE PRAISE OF Patience. The fifth daies worke. Sweete Patience thou soueraigne of perfection, Of Gratious thoughts the only Gouernesse: Who by the Rules of thy diuine direction, Do'st bring the heart to highest Happinesse: My humble soule with thy sweete loue enflame, That I may sing in honour of thy name. The purest thoughts that euer heart possessed The clearest Obiect of the carefull'st Eie, The present Medicine of the Minde distressed, The only ease in euery Miserie: In all the proofe of Wits Experience In heart, and minde, and soule, is patience. It puts off feare of Fortunes forwardnes, And only rests on Resolution: It wrestles with the worlds vntowardnes, And holds the state of Reasons Constitution: It conquers Will, and so doth carrie Wit, That both are happy only but in it. It breedes no wroth, nor moueth Enuies ill, It breakes no concord, nor discention sturres: It learnes the spirit an especiall skill, Where Reasons care Repentance not incurres: And if Repentance, folly doe enforce It is a meane vnto a sweete remorce. It beareth want as if it were no woe, And suffers wrong as if it had no sence: It swallowes sorrow as it were not so, And taketh Death for lifes Ingredience: It neither feedes of fortune, feare nor fate, But alwaies is all one in euery state. In time it keepes the compasse of the hower, In action, order, measure, point, and place: In thought, the temper of the spirits power, In Wit and Reason all the Rules of Grace: In Grace the ground of that perfections story, That goeth neere the heigth of Vertues Glory. It makes the entrance into euery Action, Continues the proceedings, makes the end: It kils the Nature of vnquiet Faction, And of a foe sometime doth make a friend: It doth conceale the hearts calamitie, And makes a Vertue of Necessitie. By Patience we doe our soules possesse, And tread the path to our soules Paradice: While the impatient in their soules distresse, Headlong fall into their soules Miseries; It is a salue that healeth the soules griefe, Sorrowes rankt poison, and the soules reliefe. Patience doth try the Truth of euery thing Distills the spirits of the purest Natures: Teacheth the Muse her Musique Notes to sing, And findes the difference of all kindes of Creatures: Giues bodies health, and makes the spirits diet, And brings the soule vnto Eternall quiet. She keepes the Husband chaste vntill he marrie, The Wife obedient to her Band of loue: It makes the Mother for her Childe to tarrie, And Seruants waite for their Rewards behouve: It makes the Sea-man tarie for a winde, And poore men waite till richer men haue dinde. It makes the wounded Man endure his dressing, The sicke Man see the loosing of his blood: The poore Man beare the paine of his oppressing, The good Man against euill to doe good: The wise Man study for the state of Blisse, The holy Man finde where all blessing is. It keepes the King from thoughts of Crueltie, The Noble Peere from Prides Ambition: The Counsailour from all Impietie, The Courtier from all ill condition: The Church-man from the error of selfe-will, The Lay-man from the exercise of ill. By patience Dauid had a princely fame, And Iob his patience hath a worthy praise: But Christ his patience hath the Glorious name, That euer liues to neuer ending daies: Since then in God and Man it is so glorious, Let it be held a Vertue all victorious. In God it doth a worke of Mercy show, In Mercy Comfort, and in Comfort Grace: In Grace that loue from which that life doth flow, That shewes where Patience hath a happy place: Oh blessed Patience that in Man doth proue, Gods Mercies comfort in his Gratious loue. It brings the heart to Loues Humilitie, Humility to Truthes simplicitie: And simple Truth to Cares Tranquilitie, And quiet Care to faith's felicitie: And happy Faith vnto that fairest Blisse, In which the fairest of all Blessing is. And since that in Humility I finde True Patience hath her purest Residence: And brings the heart, the spirit, and the minde Vnto the height of Reasons Excellence: Let me a little shew what Vertue saies, In setting down Humilities due praise. THE PRAISE OF Humilitie. The sixth daies worke. Oh the sweet sence of loues Humilitie, Which feares displeasure in a dearest friend: The only note of true Nobilitie, Whose worthy Grace is gracèd without end: While faithfull loue in humble Truth approued, Doth euer liue of God and Man beloued. Her Grace is Gratious in the sight of God, Makes men as Saints, and women Angels seeme: Makes sinne forgotten, Mercy vse no Rod, And constant Faith to grow to great esteeme: And is in some a Blessing of the Highest, And to the Nature of himselfe the Nighest. It maketh Beauty like the Sunne to shine, As if on earth there were a heau'nly light: It maketh Wit in Wisedome so diuine, As if the Eie had a Celestiall sight: It is a Guide vnto that Hauen of Rest, Where Blessed soules doe liue for euer blest. In Christ it is a Grace of worthy Glory, In Man from God, a gift of speciall Grace: While in the state of Vertues honours story, Wisedome doth finde it in perfections place: And plac't so high in the Almighties loue, As nothing more can Mercies comfort proue. It makes the eye looke downe into the heart The heart obedient vnto wit and sence: And euery limbe to play a Seruants part, Vnto the will of Wits preheminence: It brings the Minde vnto the Body so, That one the other cannot ouergoe. It is the death of pride and patience loue, Passions Phisitian, Reasons Counsailour: Religions Darling, Labours Turtle Doue, Learnings Instructer, Graces Register: Times best Attendant, and Truthes best Explainer, Vertues best Louer, and Loues truest Gainer. It is the Princes Grace, the Subiects duty, The Schollers lesson, and the Souldiours line: The Courtiers credite, and the Ladies Beauty, The Lawyers vertue, and the loue diuine: That makes all sences Gratious in his sight, Where all true Graces haue their Glorious light. It makes the heart fit for all good Impression, It doth prepare the spirit for perfection: It brings the soule vnto her sinnes confession, It helpes to cleare the body from infection: It is the meane to bring the minde to rest, Where heart, soule, body, minde, and all are blest. It made the Mother of the Sonne of God, Gratious in him who made her full of Grace: And on her Sonne it blessedly abode, In bearing all the filthy worlds deface: And in his Seruants for their Maisters loue Did Faiths affections in their passions proue. It sauèd Abrahams Sonne from Sacrifice, When Isaaks death was quitted by the Ramme; It sauèd Noah and his Progenies, Where on the earth destructions Deluge came; It sauèd Lot from hurt of Sodomes fire, And Israel from cruell Pharaohs ire. It wrought in Dauid Gratious penitence, In Niniute a sweet submission: In Iob a famous blessed patience, In Paule assurance of his sinnes Remission, In Iohn the habite of a holy loue, In Christ the Grace that did all Glory proue. It euer holds the hand of faithfulnes, And euer keepes the Minde of Godlines, And euer brings the heart to quietnes, And euer leades the soule to happines: And is a Vertue of that Blessednes, That merits praise in highest worthines. Oh how it gaines the Childe the Parents loue, The wife her husband, and the seruants maisters: Where humble faith in happy hopes behouue, Findes patience care, discomforts healing plaisters: And truest course of cares Tranquillity, Only to rest but in Humility. And since that in the life of humble loue, I see the way vnto the well of Blisse: Where Patience doth in all perfection proue, Where the high Blessing of all Blessings is: Let my soule pray that I may humbly sing, The heau'nly praises of my holy King. Of the infinite praise to the infinite glory of the infinite goodnes of the infinite God. The seuenth daies worke. O glorious God, and God of only Glory, Essence and substance of all excellence: The ground, the grace, the state, and al the story, Of Vertues, Wisedoms, Graces Residence: Inspire my soule with those pure thoughts perfection, That shew some sparkle of thy loues affection. And let me not presume a looke too high, Least thou abridge the Blessing of thy loue: Nor yet so low, let me embrace mine eyes, As thy faire praises may vnfitly proue: But so thy goodnes euery where to know, That euery where I may thy Glory show. As though my soule polluted all with sinne, Vnworthy be of the least thought of Grace: Yet let thy Grace a Glorious worke begin, Thy holy spirit in my heart to place: That to the date of neuer ending daies, My soule may sing thine euerlasting praise. Before there was a light, there was a light, Which saw the world, the world could neuer see: From which, the world receiues her brightest sight, And brightnes more then in the world may be: Oh heauenly light aboue all earthly seeing, Where only Vertue hath her only being. From the faire Brightnes of this Beauteous light, Hath Wisedomes eye an only power to see: The line of life that leades her spirit right, Vnto the place where all perfections be: Which in the worke of wonder doe approue, The Gratious labour of a Glorious loue. There Vertue doth in all her brightnes liue, Spredding abroad the braunches of her Blisse: As doth the Sonne his beames of brightnes giue, While in himselfe the only brightnes is: O blessed light where such a life remaineth, As giues all light, and yet all light containeth. There doth she sit, and sweetly looke about her, Beholding in the eye of Vertues light: Purenes within, perfection all without her, While in a brightnes farre aboue her sight; There liues a power her spirits loue inspiring, To frame a worke for wit and sence admiring. There from a Chaos or Confusions Map, She takes the matter of her curious frame: While in the limits of faire Vertues lap, She drawes the course and compasse of the same: Where hauing laid the groundworke of her Grace, She made the world vp in a little space. Six only dayes was for her worke ordained, The seuenth to rest, the labour of her loue: Her time she kept, and in her care retained, Such forme and measure as did truly proue; Her Maister taught her euery rule so right, That all was good and pleasing in his sight. Her first daies worke was in the Heauens on high, When she deuided darknes from the light: Wherein all pleasing the all seeing Eie, The light she callèd day, the darknes night: When hauing heauen and earth of nothing framed, The Morne and Euening she the first day named. The second day vpon the waters, she Did fall to worke, and made a Firmament: By which, the waters should deuided be, That were in this confusèd continent: Where euery one within their bounds should stay, So, Euen and Morne she made her second day. Then from the earth the waters she deuided, And gath'red all together, call'd then Seas: And by her skill so carefully prouided, That in her worke she did her Maister please Then made the earth, and callèd it dry land, Thus did the labour of her third daies hand. In which she made the earth to fructifie, In leafe, and fruit, Tree, bud and hearbe, and seede: In which she did her Maister glorifie, Who, seeing all, said all was good in deede: So in her worke thus worthily commended, In morne and euening was her third day ended. Thus in the heau'ns the shining lights she framed, That should diuide betwixt the day and night: The greater lights, the Sunne and Moone she named, Which should giue Rules to times and seasons right: The lesser starres to whom she gaue a light, To twinkle like the Candels of the Night. And in this worke she kept her course so well, And still the state of Grace so vnderstood: As he in whom all Graces only dwell, In sight of goodnes saw that all was good: So where no praise her worth diminishèd, The Euen and Morne her fourth day finishèd. Then to the waters she her worke applies, And made each mouing and each creeping thing: And in the Heauen each featherèd fowle that flies, And euery Creature that doth carie wing: When all seem'd good in her great Maisters eie, Who bad them all encrease and multiplie. Thus hauing wrought with infinite conceite, The sundry forme and shape of euery Creature: With such inuention as exceedes the height Of Wit and Reasons praises highest Nature. While high perfection each proportion framed, The Euen and Morning was her fift day named. Thus when that her weekes worke was almost done, She hath her choisest worke to take in hand: For which before the Modell be begun, She must vpon her Maisters counsaile stand: How she may shape his loue, his liuely picture, To haue his patience pleasèd in his Creature. When hauing fauour in his high perfection, With humble care a lump of clay she takes: Of which, by Rules of his Diuine direction Vnto his Image perfect man she makes: Who so in loue did to his liking fall, That vnder Heau'n he made him Lord of all. Thus hauing made vp all her workmanship, Within the limits of her fairest loue: Where constant Truth could neuer take a trip, While carefull Patience did perfection proue: When all was good, in goodnes all enstalled, The Euen and Morning she the sixt day called. And seeking now her sacred thoughts to rest, Vpon the Grace of the Eternall good: She findes the Sabaoth by her Maister blest, Who giues her spirits that especiall food: That after all the labour of her daies, Doth make her sing his euerlasting praise. Which, as I finde, in her faire Musique sounding, Although it be a Note aboue my reach: Yet on the Grace of Vertue only grounding, As her sweet spirits doth my spirit teach: My humble soule shall straine my heart to Sing, The Gratious praises of my Glorious King. O holy Essence of all holines, Grace of all Glory, Glory of all Grace: Perfections Vertue, Vertues perfectnes, Place of all Beauty, Beauty of all place: Truths only Triall, Times Eternitie, Incomprehensible in thy Deitie. Wisedomes deuiser, Father of her loue, Constancies proofe, and life of patience: Humilities Essence, Faiths true Turtle Doue, Mercies Almighty Glorious Residence: Sweet Iesus Christ, mine humble soule enflame, To sing the glory of thy holy Name. Before what was, but that which euer is, The Godhead all Incomprehensible: Sweet Iesus Christ, the Essence of all Blisse, But in his Manhood only sensible: My Sauiour was, and in himselfe alone, Containing all things, but contain'd in none. The Nature of all Vertues in his Nature Had all their Essence of their only Being: When in Creation of each kinde of Creature, Wisedome in him had only all her seeing: Whose loue in him such constant patience found, That of her Grace and Glory was the ground. His spotlesse Vertue all his life did proue, In doing good to all, and ill to none: His Wisedome did the Doctors wonder moue, His loue the Touchstone of all Truth alone: His Constancie euen to his dying hower, Did shew his patience, had a heau'nly power. And for the Note of his Humility, His crosse bare witnes in his life and death: Who bare all basenes Inciuility, Yet neuer breath'd the smallest angry breath: O Glorious King that came from Heauen on high, Vpon the earth for Beggers so to die. His vertue in his will, his word doth show His Wisedome in Election and Creation: His loue, his Louers by his death doe know, His Constancie, his patience confirmation: His patience his humility did proue, And all in some his Glory from aboue. Whose Vertue such, as his that could not sinne? Whose Wisedome such, as worketh Vertues will? Whose loue is such, as Wisedome liueth in? Whose Constancie doth shew such Kindnes still? Whose patience such, as did his passion show? Or who so high, and euer brought so low? What Vertue doth, his Wisedome doth expresse, What Wisedome doth, his loue doth manifest: What loue doth, doth his constancie confesse, What Constancie doth, in his patience blest: What Patience doth, Humility doth tell, In him alone they all and only dwell. Then let the vertuous for all vertue loue him, And let the wise in Wisedomes loue admire him: And let the constant in all kindnes proue him, And let the patient patiently desire him: And let the humble humbly fall before him, And all together all in all adore him. Oh that the world could see his vertues Beauty, Or wit of man his Wisedomes Maiestie: Or Loue could looke into his Constancie, Or patience into his humility: Then vice, nor folly, frailty, rage, nor pride, Should in the mindes of men so much abide. His Vertue made the first perfections Nature, His Wisedome made the forme of all perfection: His loue did giue the life to euery Creature, His Constancie the cares of Loues direction: His patience Medicine for all Miseries, His humblenes the way to Paradice. Would'st thou be perfect? in his vertue know it, Would'st thou be vertuous? in his wisedome learne it: Would'st thou be wise? in his loue only shew it, Would'st thou be louing? in his life discerne it: Would'st thou be constant? in his care conceiue it, Would'st thou be patient? in his death perceiue it. Would'st thou be humble? in his lowlines Learne to submit thy selfe to higher powers: Would'st thou be blessèd in his Blessednes? Learne to bestow the labour of thine howers: Would'st thou be holy, and liue happy euer? Liue in his loue, and thou shalt liue for euer. The infinite good thoughts his vertue giueth, The infinite good works his will perfecteth: The infinite good life in his loue liueth, The infinite loue his constancie effecteth: Th' infinite constancie his patience proueth, Doe humbly shew what infinitenes loueth. Since Vertues (then) good thoughts are infinite, And infinite is Vertue in good thought; And infinite is Wisedome in good wit, And infinite is loue by Wisedome wrought; And infinite is constancie in loue, Which infinitely patience doth proue. In infinite Humility of hart, Vnto the height of all Infinitie: In infinite perfection of each part, That makes the infinite Diuinitie: The Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost all three, In one, one God, all infinite Glory bee. And since no hart is able to attaine, Vnto his holy and eternall praise: To whom doth duly appertaine, The date of Glories neuer ending dayes: When Angels in their Haleluiah dwell, Let me but sing Amen, and I am well.TO ALL LEARNED and Vertuous Schollers, and gratious Studients, honour and happiness.

INGRATIS SERUIRE NEFAS. Of all the sinnes that euer raign'd, Since wickednesse hir world began: That Nature beautie most hath stain'd, Within the wretched hart of Man: And neerest doth to hell allude, Is that of fowle Ingratitude. It kils the Eie of Reasons sight, With fowle obliuions foggy mists: And make the spirit to delight, But in the harmes of had I wists: And mires the soule in sinnes fowle flud, While lack of grace, can see no good. It studies onely to destroie, A gentle spirit with despight: And knowes no part of Heauenly ioy, That pleads so in the Diuels right: It is a hagge, that heauens doe hate, And dwels, but with the Reprobate. It bringeth foorth such shamefull Euill, Out of the shamelesse wicked minde: As by suggestion of the Diuell, Makes Nature goe against hir kinde: When Men that should bee Vertues friends, Become but Machauilian fiends. There is no thought can bee so vile, Nor word can sound so ill a worth: Nor cursèd state, so ill a stile, As can Ingratitude set foorth: Which was the curse of Adams seede, And neuer since did better deede. Where it doth once infect the hart, The Sonne doth wish the Fathers death: The Wife doth seeke the Husbands smart, The Brother stops the Sisters breath: The Neighbour, and the neerest friend, Will plot each others speedy end. It makes the Seruant to forget, His duty to his Maisters loue: The subiect all his wits to set, Rebellion to his Prince to prooue: The Villaine for a Comfort lent, For to beetraie the Innocent. It maketh Man forget his God, In whom alone hee hath his beeing: His Comfort and his Mercies Rod, Whereof his Soule can haue no seeing: Vntill to late in hell he findes, How God doth hate vngratefull mindes. Oh what it doth, or doth it not? That may agrieue an honest minde: To see the power that Sinne hath got Vpon the curse of humane kinde: While Comfort, Kindnesse, Care, and Cost Vpon vnthankfulnesse are lost. Oh Hellish Worme, that eates the wombe, Wherein it lay, to looke abroade: And plots the Meane to make his Tombe, Whose house had beene his chiefe aboade: While faithlesse friends make hellish fiends, God send all Iudasses such ends. A King that on a time ordain'd, A punishment for euery vice: Was askèd, why hee did refraine On this to set down his deuice: It is quod hee, beyond my wit, I leaue to God to punish it. As who should say, the sinne were such, As did all other so exceede: That were the torment nere so much, It were no more then it did neede: That all the world might warning winne, To flie the thought of such a sinne. Oh, how much worse then any Beast, It makes the shape of Man to proue? For shape is most and Man is least, That so doth swarue from Natures loue: And in the hate of honours Nature, Becomes the worst of any creature. Fie, fie, vpon Ingratitude, The Sinne of Sinnes that euer was: That doth the soule to much delude, And brings the world to such a passe: That lack of loues Gratuitie, Hath almost worne out Charitie. Of Wormes, the Viper is the worst, That eates the Bowells that did breed him Of Birds, the Cuckoe most accurst That kils the Sparrow that did feed him: And is not man more halfe a Diuell? That so requiteth good with Euill? A poore Man going to a wood, Within the Snow an Adder found: When, wishing how to doe it good, Did take it vp, from off the ground: And fearing of no future harme, Did in his bosome keepe it warme. But comming home vnto the fire, No sooner hee had loosde his Coate: But, to requite his kinde desire, The Adder bit him by the throate: Now whereto doth this tale alude? But onely to Ingratitude. There was a Lyon as I reade, Who had a Thorne got in his foote: Which in his trauaile sore did bleede, While to his hart the payne did shoote: With which, vnto his Denne hee came And fell to licking of the same. When, as he stoode hee spied a Man, Who had beene thether fled for feare: And in his hart, with griefe beegan, To mourne his haplesse beeing there: Yet, seeing how the Lyon stoode, Aduenturèd to doe him good. And feeling softly where it stucke, So cunningly did beate about: As with his mouth first fell to sucke Then, with his Teeth, did get it out: And after did such help apply, That hee was easèd by and by. And when the Lyon felt such ease, Hee reacht him out a Princely Pawe; As who should say to such as please, I carry comfort in my Clawe: And to requite his kindnesse then Hee led him foorth out of his Den. And brought him through a wildernesse, Into a high way, neere a towne: When in a Princely gentlenesse, Before his face, hee sat him downe: And with his Pawe as Poets tell, Did giue a Kingly kinde farewell. Now shortly after it befell, This Lyon was by hunters caught: And as the story seemes to tell, Vnto an Emperour was brought: And with great Ioy and Iolitie Presented to his Maiestie. Which Lyon kept, as others are, That so are caught, and so are brought: To feede vpon such hungry fare, As, tamnesse had his stomacke taught: Did liue such Trayterous harts to teare: As to such death condempnèd weere. Where Long this Lyon had not beene, But that the Man that heal'd his wound: Whose Eie had neuer Treason seene, Nor Spirit such a thought had found: Iniuriously was apprehended, And vnto such a death condempnèd. Who beeing brought vnto the Den, Whereas the Lyon fiercely stood: To teare in peeces, those ill men, That fed him with their poisoned blood: Before his face did kindelie stand, And pawde and lickt him on the hand. The lookers on amaz'd to see, The Lyon thus the Man entreate: Did wonder what the cause should bee, His loue to him should bee so great: And to the Emperour did tell, What all before their Eies beefell. Who comming thether to behold, The truth of that hee thus had heard: And seeing still the prisoner hold, His place with him: a great reward Did promise him, the cause to show, That made the Lyon vse him so. When, of the Lyon, taking leaue, With kissing of his Kingly foote: To make his Maiestie conceiue, The truth of all euen from the roote Hee ript vp all that hee had done, Whereby this Lyons loue beegunne. The Emperour well pleas'd to heare, How euery point and part did grow: Before his presence made appeere, The wretches that had wrong'd him so: And threw them in his wrathfull power. Vnto the Lyon to deuower. Who sparèd none but slew them all: The Man was Royally rewarded: The Note to this effect did fall, That thanckfulnesse was much regarded: The Lyon still remained his friend, And so the story made an end. Oh Lord that euer Man should liue In hate of loues forgetfulnesse, And that a Lions loue should giue, Such notes of Noble thanckfulnesse: Which all in one doe but conclude, The Princely grace of Gratitude. Then shew no Vipers venum vile, To gnaw the bowells, that did breed thee: Nor Cucko like, doe loue beguile, To kill the Sparrow that did feede thee: But Lionlike doe thanckfull proue, To him that hath deseru'd thy loue. Remember what thou hast Receu'd, Of whom, why, how, and what, and where: And, let it bee, as well perceu'd, Thou doste retourne thy kindenesse there: That perfect thanckfulnesse may proue, The Nature of the Lions loue. If that thou finde, thy Mistresse kinde, Dishonor not hir qualitie: If that a noble friend thou finde, Skoffe not his liberalitie: If meane men buie thy companie, Requit them not with villanie. If that thy Father doe commend thee, Be thou not bad to shew his blindnesse: And if thy friend a saddell lend thee, Steale not his Horse to quite his kindnesse: But chiefely doe not seeke his blood, Whose loue hath liu'd to doe thee good. Forget not God, that gaue thee life, Defame not him that is thy friend: Bee not vnfaithfull to thy wife, And hold on honest to the end: For when the Knaues bee all discarded, A poore small tromp may be regarded. Doe not with Connies vndermine, The Castle where thy Captaine liues: Nor Counterfet with a Diuine, To cheate the Charitie hee giues: Least when the world doth see thy shame, Both God and Man doe hate thy name. Leaue not a Man to seeke a beast, A Monster is nor flesh, nor fish, And where thou hast receu'd a feast, Returne not home a poisoned dish: Lest they that find thy hellish Nature, Doe hold thee for a hatefull Creature. In summe, for all let this suffice, To warne thee from Ingratitude: Beehold it with your inward Eies, And let it not your soule delude: For Truth doth write that Time may reade, It is a graft of Gracelesse seede. Which growes but in a wicked ground, And beares no fruit but Infamie: And many times is blasted round, With hellish breath of Blasphemie: Yet with ill humours moystned so, As makes it wickedlie to grow. But from this wicked Hellish thing, That so infects the minde of Man: And with a most infernall sting, The wofull state of Life beegan: And doth abuse good Creatures thus, Good Lord of such deliuer vs. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE HONOVR OF VALOVR. By Nicholas Breton Gent: L'occhio nel sopra vede il Mondo. To the Right Honorable, Charles, Earle of Devon, Lord Mountioy, Lievtenant Generall, and Gouernour of Ireland, Master of his Maiesties Ordinance of England, Captaine of Portsmouth, one of his Maiesties most Honorable priuie Counsell, and Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter: Nicholas Breton wisheth a long and healthfull life, with increase of Honour on earth, and the Ioyes of Heauen, in Heauen. The Honor of Valovr. High flying mindes, cannot embase their eyes, Vpon the obiects of vnworthy sence, The stately Eagle gapes not after flies, Ambition reedes no rules of Patience; While onely Honour aymes at Excellence: And Valour sencelesse of the thought of feare, Lookes at the Sunne, &amp; loues no lower Spheare. Kings loue no equals, Phœbus shines alone, The Ocean sea disdaines the little brooke, All gems are glasse vnto the Diamond stone, A Kingdome, to the world, is but a nooke, Bloud is the Inke that writes the warlike booke, Where truth deliuers to the trompe of Fame, The terniz'd Honour of a worthy name. The trampling Steede treads out the way of terror, While Thundring Canon shootes no tennis Bals, And truth disdaineth to subscribe to error, To bring the spirit to the fleshes cals; No, the true Souldier scales the Castle wals, Entreth the Fortes, and makes the Forces yeeld, Ruines the Campe, and ouerruns the field. No, no, it is a high Astronomy That findes the starlight of a minde of State, Who in his strength will rather striue to die, Then hold his recknings at a lower rate, Then that high loue that hath the world in hate; Where dauntlesse valour duely doth aduance Deserning spirits, in despite of chaunce. The Lyons eyes doe sparkle all like Fire, The Phœnix dies and liues but in the Sunne, Aspiring spirits cannot but aspire, And when they die, then all their world is done: Yet after death a better life begunne: Where loftie fame to longest memory, Doth sound the Honour that can neuer die. The mole-like mindes that digge but vnder drosse, Haue cursèd eyes that cannot see the light; And Soules that worship but the golden Crosse, In mortal warre make but a Coward fight: The face of man was made to looke vp right. Strong harted mindes had rather burst then bend, Blest be the life brings honour in the end. When fire and smoke do all bedimme the ayre, And bloudied earth is with deade bodies paued, And valiant courage sits in conquests chaire, To heare the cries of mercy humbly craued, And harmlesse people by true pitie saued; Then feels the heart the height of pleasures power, To haue the hap to liue to such an houre. To take a Cock-boat in a Riuer Crooke, Or breake a Bulrush on a coate of Steele; To fish for honour with a siluer hooke, Or kill a Coward running, in the heele, Or worke for threed but with a spinning wheele; These haps may hit, but when that all is done, They are but all as Moates in honours Sunne. The chamber musique that inchaunts the eare, Giues sodaine silence to the Trumpets sound; And crying, Cupid doth but willow weare, While worthy Mars is with the Lawrell cround; The man of warre the Merchant runs aground, And Resolution cannot quench his fire, Till he haue either death or his desire. Ease hath no part in Passions happinesse, Nor, safety luls the watchfull eye a sleepe, And working spirits loues no idlenesse, Which haue the Key of Honours care to keepe, The noble minde can neuer learne to creepe; No, Princely Honour is the royall Prize, For which, true valour either liues or dies. The slimy Snailes that slide along the ground, And hide their heads with feare to shew their horns; The heauenly thought of honour neuer found, But are, indeed, the Noble Spirits scornes: No, Vertue so the valiant minde adornes, And on his countenance sets so faire a grace, As makes the world reioyce to see his face. Oh when a valiant heart holds vp the hand, And chargeth on the vangard of a troope; Sets both the foote and horsemen at a stand, Mazeth the Gallant, makes his feather stoupe, And puts his spirits vp into a Coope; Then what a ioy the victor doth receiue, Base mindes nor doe, nor will, nor can conceiue. When Drum, and Fife, and the report of shot, Makes Musique for the eares of noble hearts, The thought of feare is vtterly forgot, When mortal wounds doe shew but flea-bite smarts, While Death keepes racket vpon either parts: Then see how Valour fights in Honours field, Spirits leaue bodies, ere true hearts can yeeld. He that can bargaine for a bag of golde, Or shuffle cards to shift a cunning tricke, Or plaie the Wolfe within a Sheepeheards foold, Or catch an Oyster and deuour him quick, Or hit a pinne vpon a twelue-score prick; These may be men of shape, but for the minde, Where Honour goes, they euer staie behinde. He that dare fight and see his finger bleede, And can outscolde a begger in her brawle, He that can scoure the Country for a neede, And put perhaps the weake vnto the wall; And clyming Crowes neasts, venter for a fall: These may, perhaps, be men and handsome men; But neuer written, with a noble Pen. Hee that can sooth a lye, or tell a tale, And sweetely fall into the sinke of sinne; He that can rob the Parke and breake the Pale, Or tickle a great fish vnder the finne, And like a huswife learne to card and spinne: These may perhaps, haue prety apish graces; But Honour truely neuer saw their faces. Hee that can whistle at a Plowe and Cart, And catch a Weezle in a Cony hole; Hee that can eate vp a whole aple tarte, And ouerleape a blinde mare and her fole, Or strike a football strongly through a goale; These may be too, a kind of men, and so, But no such men as euer honour knowe. No, the base mindes of begger thoughts are bard From the conceipt of Honours kingly blisse; A Coward motion neuer can be heard, Where Resolution knowes what Honour is: Fortune and Feare can neuer kindly kisse. Forward and firme and faithfull to the death, Proues Honours loue, vnto the latest breath. The hate of wronge and the defence of right, The sparing dyet, the true patience, The burning lampe of Honours blessèd light, The pleasing toyle of hopes experience, The royall seate of Honours residence; These are the lines that lead the loftie minde, To looke at heauen and leaue the world behinde. The puffing fat that shewes the Pesants feede, Proues Iack a Lent was neuer Gentleman; The noble Spirit hath no power to reede, The raking Precepts of the Dripping pan; A Hoppy horse best fits maid Marian, And Chantecleere if it be rightly bred, With one true blowe will strike the dunghil dead. The Copy-wit doth no true wisdome holde, Babes will be frighted with a buzzing Flie, True Honours title is not bought and sould, None sees the Sun but with an Eagles eye, Base is his life that is afraid to die; While conscience cleare of villanous conceipt, Holds Honours hopes at a most glorious height. The silly hearts of simple witted heads, That spend their spirits in a poore deuotion Who lye and read old ballads in their beds, Where plainnesse makes the way vnto promotion, While Folly poysons Reason with a potion: These two may seem a kinde of humane creatures But haue no name in notes of Honours natures. The straining wits that stretch their braines so hie, As if their spirits spake by inspiration, Or with the wings of Phaeton will fly, To see the state of Phœbus Constellation, And onely worke for words of admiration; These may be men, and in their humours rare, But truely, Honour knowes not what they are. Arte is but idle in a worke of ease, Time but mispent in middle humord thought; Reason abus'd, that barely seekes to please, Learning but lost, in wit inclinde to nought, Wit but a Foole, that is so dearely bought; Nature a Spirit, vnto nothing spent, Till Valour compasse Honours continent. That royall fancie that is voide of feare, That Princely spirit, that doth Fortune spight, That heauenly eye that seeth euery where, That happie soule, that hath so sweete a sight, Proue in the Lamp of the eternall light, How Valours truth in Vertues quarrell proued, Doth make a minde, of God and man beloued. Yea, the true bloud that tickles at the heart, Strengthens the stomack, nourisheth the braine, Reuiues the spirit, runnes through euery part, Feedes euery muscle, swels in euery vaine, Findes death a medecine rather than a paine, Wil make the minde where Honour liues indeed Leaue works of worth, for all the world to reede. Oh the poore hearts of pitifull complaining, That onely liue, and eate, and drinke, and die: Honour, hath beene a Grace of Vertue gaining, When fooles knewe nothing of the mysterie, How Valour first began a Monarchie; But, Wisdom knowes, whose Laurel cannot wither, Valour, and Honour, euer liue together. The golden God, giues but an outward grace, Where bodies are but babies in attire; But Spirits liue in a more glorious place, Whose substance is of a celestial fire, The light of Angels in a heauenly Ouire: Where Phœbus shewes, the vertue is diuine, Where Valors actions do in Honour shine. Oh that bright shining euer blessèd Sunne, Which in his Circle cannot hide a moate, But in the course which he hath euer runne, Gaue Mars his Acts, to Mercury to note, Where Honours fame might neuer be forgot, Blest be that light that shews where Vertue liues, Honour true Valor, Valor Honour giues. And by the beames of that faire sunny light, Oh would the world did finde out honours way, That foggy mysts might not offend the sight Of those cleere eyes where valours comforts stay; But giue the night the night, the day the day: The Eagle wings to mount the loftie skye, And on the Dunghill let the Buzzard die. Then should not honour fall vpon a word, Few be by fauor, none by Fortune graced, While trewest Honour groweth by the sword. Where trew dishonour iustly is defaced, While Vertue is so high by Valour placed, The earth may see how heauens the hearts adu?ce Where Valour seekes the swords inheritance. But let it not be in vsurping mindes: For treason hath no place in honours truth, Ambition oft so much affection blinds, As bringeth reason but to ruins ru'th; Repentance euer rashnes so ensuth That valour must but fight in honors right, Or but receiue dishonor in the fight. Let Vertue then a valiant spirit leade Against thy Gods, thy Kinges, and Contryes foes: That Loue in life, and Fame when thou art dead, May sound the noates, that Noble Vertue knowes, In Honors truth that time can neuer lose: So liue, so die, so die, and euer liue, While Vertue, Grace, Valour doth Honor giue.

      <field name="fulltext">An Invective Against Treason ‘To the highe, and moste Noble Lorde: the Duke of Lineux: helthe, honor, and eternall Happines:’ An Invective against Treason Oh what a wicked, wretched worlde is this? so little fayth in Sowles, or love in Hartes; so many Mindes, minde nothing but amiss? thus, on the Earth, can Devills playe theyr partes? to poyson Sowles, w?? such Infernall Dartes? can nothing flow, but wealth and wickednes? to drown the World in all vngodlines? What Mischiefe walkes among y? minds of Men? will nothing serve theyr discontented Wills? must they needs runne into y? Devills denne? are theese y? Scopes of Machivilian skills? that all y? Worlde, with his Infection fills? Oh God, what Devill, could in ill goe further? then Pride, in malice, practise hellish Murther? To kill at all, is an vnkinde desire: to kill a Foe, is but a bloudie fact: to kill a Friend, a heate of hellish fire: to kill a Neighbour, an vngratious act: to kill a Brother, Horrors fowle Abstract: to kill a Father, too vnnaturall: to kill a King, y? wicked'st deede of all. For, Father, Brother, Neighbour, Friend or Foe, in each of theese, but fewe to Ruine runne; but, in a King, or Princes overthrowe, how many thowsand Thowsands are vndonne? woe woorth y? hand, y? such ill threed hath spunne: as, by y? woork of Sathans wickednes a Worlde of Christians should endure Distress. But, alltogither, King, Queene, Prince, and Peere; the Byshoppe, Judge, y? Lorde, the Magistrate; when they should all in Parliament appeere: for the establishing of a blessèd State: even then to shew the horror of theyr hate: by force of Fire, devisèd for the nonce; to teare y? howse, and blow them vp at once. What Eare can heere, whose spiritt doth not tremble? to thinck vpon the horror of this Act? if all y? Devills did in Hell assemble; among themselves, to make a fowle Compact: how could they finish, a more heynous fact? then so to seeke the Ruine of a State: and leave so faire a Land so desolate. But, God on High, that from his Seate beholdeth, Heaven, Earth, Sea, Hell, &amp; what each one contayneth; and, every thought, of every harte vnfoldeth; and, for his service, all and so? retayneth: hating y? pride, his powrefull hand disdayneth; hath broke y? Force of all theyr wicked frame; and made theyr woorke, vnto y? world a shame. But this good God, that gave vs our good King: and made the sorrowes of our harts to ceasse, reveales all Tractes, y? doe of Treason spring; blesseth our Land, preserves itt in his peace, and doth our sowles, from sinnefull feares release: how can his name, inough be prays'd of us? that shew's his care, his love, and mercy thus: But, oh y? griefe of griefs, in gratious thought, to see a Villayne, on a vertuous King, by secrett malice, to have Murther sought: Murther on him, and of his after-spring, what Eare hath heard of a more Hellish thing? then, for a little gayne of Prides Content, to practice Murther on the Innocent. Our gratious King, on whome y? King of Grace, hath rayn'd a shewre of his æternall graces; and over vs, hathe given the Kingly place, of high Co?aund, Co?aund, y? King of places; ordeyn'd for him, and for his Royall Races; this godly King, that God himself hathe sent vs, What doe wee ayle? that hee cannott content vs? To whome is hee a foe? but to our foes? A Neighbour borne, and ever found a friend: in love a brother, and his care who knowes, might as a soonne, a Fathers Love co?end: and for a King, lett itt be wisely ween'd, and Reasons Eies, will see that Royalty, that will coniure a Christians Loyalty. Whose proovèd love, hathe he left vnregarded? whome, but y? wicked, hathe he ever hated? whose vertuous Acts, hathe he left vnrewarded? whose power, but Prides, hathe ever he abated? whose humble Suits, hathe he left disalated? whose true affect, but hee in favour Graceth? whose Vertuous lyfe? but, hee in love embraceth? Whose virgins, hathe, his wanton love deflowrèd? whose worthy honour, hathe his skorne disgracèd? whose wealth hathe he with Avarice devourèd? whose love despisèd? or whose fame defacèd? or vertuous person, from his place displacèd? what provèd grace, but in his grace approvèd? of gracious harts, to make his Grace belovèd: Learnings advauncer, and Religions love; Wisedoms Affecter, Reasons Studient; Valours Mayntayner, Vertues Turtle Dove; Graces Companion, Honors Continent; of Maiestie Earth's Royall president; Heavens gratious blessing, &amp; worlds worthy wonder live our king James, to bring Earths kingdome vnder. Amen good God, and, Devill lett him bee, who, to this Prayer, will nott say Amen: blinde be his Eies, and, lett him neuer see; that hydes himself, in vtter Darcknes Denne; and, pinnes his thoughts, vp in Impatience penne: Where, by y? Traynes, of Treasons fowle Illusion, hee brings both Sowle, and body, to Confusion. When God in Mercy, sends a Gratious King; a King, in Grace gives token of his love; a loving King, is such a heav'nly thing; as, only, Grace, doth give from God above: to such a king, who doth a Traytour prove, to God, and Man, doth fall out so vngratefull; as, both to God, and Man, must needs be hatefull: Fie on y? worlde, that ever wickednes, should roote it self so, in the hart of Man: while graceles thoughts, in all vngodlines; doe only tincke, vpon y? goulden panne; and, make theyr bread, of an vnkindly Branne; which seeming Wheate, is but a Hellish weede, sown by the Devill, in a wicked seede. The buizie braynes, that in theyr high Conceipts: beginne to build str?nge Castles in the Ayer; will finde theyr humours fall out but deceipts: where lacke of witt, doth prove butt Follies heire: while Patience passion, sitts in sorrowes chayre, to see Repentance probe the best event; that can fall out of Rashnes discontent. Prowd Lucifer, an Angell was of light, till hee presum'd, to mount a steppe to high; but see what grew, of this vngratious fight; from Heaven to Hell, he gatt his fall therby; a iust rewarde, of wicked Treacherie: where losse of Grace, and gayne of endless griefe, payes home y? prowd, y? Traytor, and the Thiefe. For Pride first layes the wicked plott of Treason; Treason steales in, to the Ambitious breast; Ambition robbs, both witt and sence of Reason, the hart, of truthe, the spiritte of his rest; and makes it cursèd, that might ells be blest; Oh hellish Pride, the Essence of all Euill; and only liue, to leade Man to the Devill. Why, Pride, doth blinde y? Eie, Infects y? Minde, vennums y? harte, and gives the Sowle a sting; and in all vileness, of so vile a kinde; none can describe itt, 'tis so vile a thing: itt doth ill humours, to such Issue bring; that pittie 'twere, but such a plague approvèd, from Christian harts, should ever be removèd. O the sweete sence of Loves Humilitie, which feares displeasure, in a deerest friend; the only note of truth's Nobilitie, whose woorthy grace, is gracèd without end. for who wants Fayth, wants little of a Friend; while Faythfull love, in humble truth approovèd. doth ever live, of God, and Man belovèd. Alas, y? little time of Natures leave, to runne the Course of her alotted Care; where idle shadowes, doe y? Eie deceive, that only hunteth, after Fortunes Share and, had, must leave itt e're it be aware; looke, looke att Heaven, and lett y? world goe by, better to die to live, then live to die. Oh 'tis a Woe, to thinck vpon the thought, that entreth into a defilèd harte, and, with what speede, y? witt is overwrought, that once is led, to learne the Devills Arte, who will have all, if once he gett a parte, while, still, one sinne, he heapes vpon another, till he the Sowle, in vtter darckness smother. Hee makes a King, esteem'd belowe his state; Murther, a Plott, where Pollicie may plodde; Pride, a brave humor, Wealth, a Magistrate; Content, a Kingdome, and a King, a God; butt, in these humors, Heaven an[d] Hell are odde: For good mistaken, prove's in fine so evill, as farre from God, doth make him prove a Devill; What can be thought, to be y? fruict of Treason? feare in the thoughts, before it be effected; a lacke of Grace, and, an abuse of Reason: where heedless witt, is all by will directed, till bothe, by wisedome, ruin'd and reiected: while hope of honor, runnes on Fortunes wheeles, find's Death, and Hell, to followe att theyr heeles. Who can have pittie on so vile a sowle? as Murther seekes, on such a gratious King? his name is surely in the Devills Rowle; whose hart hath thought, of such a Hellish thing: for, butt from Hell, doe all such horrors spring: Where, lett vs see, how wicked witts doe woorcke, and, how y? Devill, in theyr wills doth lurcke. When Craft hath gotten Wealth, and Riches ease, and Ease, bredd Pride; and Pride, Ambition; Ambition seekes, but itt owne self to please; and lack of pleasure breedes Sedition; there, if a wicked Sowles condition; beginne to build the Tower of Babilon, who would not laugh att his Confusion? Who hathe enough, and yett will seeke for more, lett him remember Midas choaking gould; and such a Steward for y? Devills store, only, in Hell doth his high Office hold; who hathe for Coyne, his Sowle and Conscience solde: A Traytor proves in such a high degree, as meritts hanging on y? highest Tree. Oh, when a Crue of idle headded witts, y? thinck they have a world within theyr braynes, to Counsaile fall in theyr fantastick fitts, by lacke of Grace, to all vngratious Traynes; see, how they make theyr profitt of theyr paynes: Sorrow, and shame, Despaire, Death, &amp; Damnation, the story writes, of Judas Consternation. Oh glorious God, since Man was first created, was ever hard so great a Villanie? or ever Men deserv'd so to be hated? as this accursèd hellish Company? that, in theyr Sowles could hyde such Treacherie? lett all y? World, through all the Worlde goe seeke, what Age hathe seene, or Eare hathe hard y? like. Butt our good God, y? with his glorious Eie, beholds his Children in his chary love; and, in y? greatnes of his Maiestie, y? seelly weakenes of our Sowles doth prooue; from his great Mercy, in the Heavens above; Even when wee most, his Mercy have offended, still, from destruction, hath our state defended. Oh blessèd Bryttayne, more then greatly blessed, in God, thy King, his Counsaile, and thy state: how can his glory, be enough expressed? which to y? worlde, thy wonder may relate, where, nott by force of Fortune, nor of Fate, butt, by his Grace, thy King and Counsailes Care. this thy deliver?nce, iustly may declare. Oh heathen, hatefull, and most hellish sowles, voyde of all thought of God, or of his Grace; y? so could make, y??? throates, such blouddie bowlles, and such a poyson, in theyr spiritts place, y? roote of Honor, from y? land to race: oh y? such beasts, as such a shame doe beare, could be forgott, as if they never weare. Surely in Hell, this plott, had first a breeding, from thence, in lowe places talk't vpon; low in a Sellar, had itt then proceeding; to seeke a Kingdomes whole Confusion, by a most horrible destruction; thus, low in hell, &amp; Earth, by wicked fiends, wicked beginnings, make as wicked eends. But, truly, lowly, had those spiritts bene, they had nott sett, theyr haughty minds so high; nor, had theyr Eies, w?? shame and sorrowe seene, the hatefull fruictes of Hellish Treachery: butt Pryde, the plotter of all Villany, in cursèd thoughts, where all confusions dwell, wrought low on Earth, to bring them down to Hell. For, Gallowes mindes, not gallant mindes indeede, that make Rebellion, but a Rule of witt, doe seeldome better with theyr Treason speede; then iustly is, for such Offences fitt; for, God himself, that ever hateth itt, howe're y? Devill blinde theyr damnèd eies, will plague them, with a world of Miseries. Fooles, more then madd w?? stra?ge Imaginations, aspiring higher, then the hope of Grace, doe headlong runne theyr sowles into damnation, careles to note, the nature of theyr race, while Beggars seeke, both lorde and King to place; and, woorke such wonders, as were never knowne, till all theyr wicked thoughts be overthrowne. For, when King, Prince, &amp; lord, &amp; knight were gone, then Beggars would beginne a government: and Lords, and Princes, should be every one, within y? Compasse of the Continent, of this rebellious beastly Rablement; but of this Dreame, see what awake doth fall, the Hangman cu?s, and makes an end of all. For, was there ever such an idle Dreame? to overthrowe a Kingdome with a Blast? did ever witt so worke against y? Streame? all care of Conscience, from y? Sowle to cast? and with theyr Sowles, to runne to hell so fast? itt can nott be, but thatt y? Men were madd, that in theyr braynes, such wicked humours hadd. Doe wee not see itt every hower effected? Treason still hatefull, both to God and Man? and traytrous harts, from heavenly truth reiected; and, Hell y? place, where first y? Plott began; when first the Devill sought y? spoyle of Man; where Evahs pryde, and Judas avarice, doe shew y? substa?ce of theyr deep device. Oh Pride, betrayer of vntempered thought, and avarice the enimie of Grace; w?? brings the happs of all theyr hopes to nought; that in theyr sowles doe suffer them a place; most filthy sinnes, that doe all fame deface; God bless all Brittaynes and all Brittany, from all the vennum of such Villany. And, sweete Lords, y? you doe playnely see, how God doth plague this hellish sinne of pride; and what y? ends of all such Traytours bee, that in theyr harts doe such a vennum hide; Oh, lett itt never, neere your harts abide, but, thinck, the note of truthes Nobilitie, all in the vertue of Humilitie. Which grace is gratious in the sight of God, makes Men, as Saincts, and Women Angells seeme; makes sinne forgotten; Mercy vse no rodd, and constant fayth, to growe in greate esteeme: where Wisedomes care, can never truthe misdeeme and is, in summe, a blessing of y? Highest, and to y? Nature of himself the nighest. Itt maketh vertue, so in Beautie shine, as if on Earth, there were a heav'nly light; itt maketh witt, in wisedome so divine, as if the Eie, had a Cœlestiall sight; itt is a Guide, that lead's the spirite right; vnto y? place of that æternall rest, wherein the spirite lives for ever blest. Itt makes a Court, a kinde of Paradise, in subiects service, and y? King his grace; whose favour draw's theyr harts vnto his Eies, while they live blessèd, to behold his face; O blessèd King, that in his blessèd place; in subiects love, beholds his safeties being, while they live happie in theyr Princes seeing. God, in his mercy send those humble mindes, vnto the subiects of our gratious King, that hee whose wisedome, in true Iudgement findes, of humble fayth, what fruicts doe fayrely spring, in his good grace may give vs cause to sing; if on y? Earth a heaven be figur'd thus, the Lorde of Heaven, graunt itt in him and vs. Confound, ô lorde, the forces of his foes, cutt off y? Traytours, y? intend him ill; and of his thoughts, and Actions so dispose, that wee may see thy wisedome in his will and, so his spirite with thy blessing fill, that he may seeke to glorifie thy name, and wee be humblie thanckfull for the same. O heav'nly God, lett never hellish brayne, haue power to doe his Maiestie misdeede; and lett themselves, even by themselves be slayne, that doe theyr spirites, with such poyson feede; and lett our harts, in teares of Comforte bleede, to thinck on thee, to bless thy People thus, to have so good a King, raigne over us. Bless him, our Queene, and gratious Prince of ours, and all theyr ofspring, in theyr princely places; rayne on theyr sowles, in thy cœlestiall showres, the heav'nly Comforts of thy holy graces; that, when thow seest, thy favours in theyr faces, they, in theyr loves; and wee, in thanckfull harts, may in thy prayses, make true Musicks parts. Blesse him, and his, w?? grace, long lyfe, and health, and with the Joye of Joyes æternitie; his Peeres with wisedome; and his state w?? wealth; his Nobles harts, with truth's Nobilitie; his Subiects, all, with Loves humilitie; his Government, with such a woorthy fame, that hee, and wee, may glorifie thy name. Vnto which prayer, let thatt wretch nott live, that doth not sound Amen, with sincere hart; and doth nott thee, due glory, humblie give; that vnto vs, in Mercy doth impart, such good to good, for our too ill desart: and grace our Musicke, playd on true hart strings, for our King James, blest be the King of Kings. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I WOVLD AND would not. 1 I Would I had, as much as might be had, Of wealthy wishes, to the worldes content: That I might liue, all like a lusty Ladde, And scorne the world, and care not how it went: But eate, and drinke, and sleepe, and sing, and play, And so in pleasures, passe my time away. 2 And yet I would not: for too wealthy then, I should be troubled with a world of toyes: Kinred, Companions, Troups of Seruing-men; Fashion-Deuisers, Fooles, and Guirles, and Boyes: Fidlers, and Iesters, Monkeys, Apes, Babounes, Drunckards, and Swaggerers, and such trouble-townes. 3 Besides I should forget to finde the way, That leades the Soule to her Eternall blisse; And then my state were at a wofull stay, No, I would wish, a better world then this. And in Affictions, here on Earth to dwell, Rather then seeke my Heau'n on earth, and run to hell. 4 I would I were a man of such deepe wit, As might discerne the depth of euery cause: That wheresoere I did in Iudgement sit, I might be held a Note-booke, in the Lawes. My braine might seeme a kinde of miracle: And euery word I spake, an Oracle. 5 And yet I would not: for then, woe were me, I should be troubled with a world of Cases: Both rich and poore, would then my Clients be, Some, with their pleasing, some with piteous faces: And when the Rich had left their briberie, I should not rest for Forma pauperie. 6 I would I were a man of greatest power, That swaies a Scepter, on this worlds great Masse. That I might sit on Toppe of pleasures Tower, And make my will, my way, where ere I passe, That Lawe might haue her being from my breath, My smile might be a life, my frowne a death. 7 And yet I would not: for then, doe I feare, Enuy or Malice would betray my trust: And some vile spirit, though against the haire, Would seeke to lay mine honor in the dust. Treason, or Murther, would beset me so: I should not knowe, who were my friend, or foe. 8 No, I do rather wish the Lowe estate, And be an honest Man, of meane degree: Be lou'd for good, and giue no cause of hate, And clime no higher, then a Haw-thorne tree; Pay euery man his owne, giue Reason, right: And worke all day, and take my rest at night. 9 For sure in Courtes, are worlds of costly Cares, That comber Reason, in his course of rest: Let me but learne, how thrift both spends and spares. And make enough as good as any feast. And fast, and pray, my daies may haue good end, And welcome all, that pleaseth God to send. 10 I would I were the fairest sweetest Creature, That could be painted with the purest Art: That Arte might wonder at the worke of Nature, How so perfection made vp euery part. That euery Eye that saw mee, might admire mee, And euery heart, heard of me, might desire me. 11 And yet I would not: for then, out alasse, I should be troubled with a world of fooles: When many a simple Idle headed Asse, Would put his wits vnto some Poets schooles, To learne to make a verse to flatter mee: As there were no such louing foole as hee. 12 No, I doe rather wish the louely Browne, Where vertues Beauty makes the Inward faire: Then be the gallant gazer of the towne, And make mine honor, but a Barbers Chaire: When none that had, with losse of treasure tride me, Once finding my foule Inside would abide me. 13 I would I were an Innocent, a foole, That can do nothing else but laugh or crie: And eate fat-meate and neuer go to schoole; And be in loue, but with an Apple-pie: Weare a pide-Coate, a Cockes-Combe, and a Bell, And thinke it did become me passing well. 14 And yet I would not: for then should I not Discerne the difference, twixt the good and bad: Nor how the gaine of all the world is got, Nor who are sober, wise, nor who are mad. Nor in the Truth of follies sence to see: Who's the foole now? ther's no such foole as hee? 15 I would I were a Fidler, and could play, A thousand quauers in a minutes space: And at a Bridale, brauely leade the way, Before the Bride, and giue the Groome, a Grace, That I might shake the head, and stare, and gape, And make a thousand faces like an Ape. 16 And yet I would not: for ten to one My fiddle or my fingers should not rest: But euery Iacke a Lute would call vpon, Such Moris daunces as doe like him best: And euery wagtaile with a wanton Eye, Would hang vpon me for a Heidegy. 17 I would I were a Cuckolde Wittall Asse, And car'de not who did mount my Hackney Saddle, Yet thinke I haue as true a louing Lasse As ere lay in Swadling Clouts or Cradle: And manerly goe to the Church before her, And would not heare, how many did bewhore her. 18 And yet I would not: for then doe I feare, My hornes would be so hard, I could not bide them And when their weight were more then I could beare Alas I know not what to doe to hide them. But euery one would say in bitter scornes, Looke yonder goes a gallant paire of hornes. 19 I would I were the arranst Cuckolde maker, That euer answerde for his Aperne sport: There should not scape a wench, but I would take her And set her to her worke in such a sort That all the world should know, while I had health I would not see an Idle Common-wealth. 20 And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt, Bride-well and I, should wrestle for the Whippe: And once got in, I hardly should get out, Till I had soundly pay'd for Trully-Trippe: When all the Beggers in the streets would whoo me, And do me all the shame, that they could do me. 21 I would I were a most notorious Thiefe That might affright all true men, where I goe: And when I made demaund, they might be briefe, That in their Budgets doe my busines knowe. And such as trauaile, with concealèd treasure, Should be but Stewards, to maintain my pleasure. 22 And yet I would not: for then out of doubt, Some dogge, or diuel, would for Coyne betray me: Some priuy search, would surely finde me out, Or Watch, or Warrant, some way, would way-lay me. And being caught with Bills, and Clubbes, and staues, Bee guarded, with a crue of beastly Slaues. 23 Then to the Iustice, brought with such a Ioy, As if some Campe or Castle were surprisde: Who knowing how such Stragglers doe destroy, A world of wealth, hath presently deuisde, Vnto the Iaylers keeping to commend me: Where I must stay, vntill the gallowes end me. 25 No, I had rather leade a quiet life, And feare to looke no true man in the face: Keepe a poore house, maintaine an honest wife, Trauell no further then the Market-place. On Sundayes goe to Church, and home againe, And with my neighbors drinke a pot, or twaine. 26 I would I were a Iuggler, and could play A thousand prankes vpon a Pepper-corne: And draw the wittes of Wyzardes, so away, They all might wonder at a Bullockes-horne. And with their purses runne and follow mee, To make them think they see they doe not see. 27 And yet I would not: for then well I know, Some Eye, or other, would my sleights descrye: And to the world reueale my cunning so, I could not answere for my Knauery. But some Curst-queane, would either cracke my crown, Or Constable, would course me out of town. 28 I would I were a Myller, and could grinde A hundred thousand bushells in an houre: And ere my Master and my Dame had dinde, Be closely filtching of a bagge of Floure. And send it to my Sweet-hart, for to make, A Pudding-pie, a Pastey or a Cake. 29 And yet I would not: least my Thumbes should be Held all too great vpon my towling-dish: And such as did my secret cunning see, Might curse, and wish mee many a bitter wish: And say, when they before the Mill-dore-stand, The Millers-thumb's as broade as halfe a hand. 30 No, I had rather fairely buye my bread, And spend it as I get it honestly: Then scarcely sleepe in quiet in my Bed, When I but thinke vpon my subtilty; To lay the wench along vpon the Sacke, And steale her meale, ere she had turn'd her back. 31 I would I were a Taylor, and could cut, A thousand yardes of Veluet out in shreads: And in my purse the money closely put, While simple hearts were beating of their heads, With labours toyle to keepe a poore estate, Like honest Cutberd and his bony-Kate. 32 And yet I would not: least by falshoods trade, I should be call'd a stealer, that's a thiefe: No, in no wise, by such meanes to be made A Master-workman, were too great a griefe. No, Let me rather be an honest youth, That neuer stoole a yarde of stuffe in truth. 33 I would I were a Keeper of a Parke, To walke with my bent Crosse-bow, and my hound, To know my Game, and closely in the darke, To lay a barren-Doe vpon the ground. And by my Venizon, more then by my Fees, To feede on better meate then bread and cheese. 34 And yet I would not: least if I be spide, I might be turnèd quite out of my walke; And afterwards more punishment abide, Then longs vnto a little angry talke. And cause more mischiefe after all, come to me, Then all the good the Does did euer doe me. 35 No, I would rather bee an honest Keeper, To walke my Parke, and looke vnto my Pales; And not to play the sluggard and the sleeper, And holde my Land-lord vp with idle tales. Take but my Fees, be merry with my Dame. And so to gaine, and keepe an honest name. 36 I would I were a Collyer, might sell Coles, And fill my sackes a quarter full of dust: And hauing emptied them in some darke holes, Sweare out my measure to be full, and iust. Then laugh to thinke when I were gotten home. How I had couzen'd a kinde-hearted Mome. 37 And yet I would not: least by my black face, I might be held a Diuell then in deed: And so to doe my fellowes all disgrace When many a one the worse for me should speed. No, God forbid, let me be true and iust, While other hide, the Diuell in the dust. 38 I would I were a Gardiner, and had skill, To digge and rake, and plant, and sowe, and slippe The Caterpiller, and the Mowle to kill, To proyne my Trees, and all my stalks to strippe. And when to plucke my fruite, and sowe my seeds, And how to keep my Gardein cleane from weeds. 39 And yet I would not: for then should I feare, The Thiefe, the Mowle, the Worm, and blasting windes: I should not looke about me any where, But I should finde some crosses in their kindes. My Plants would wither, or my seedes would rot, Or loose in one yeare, more then ere I got. 40 No, I would rather take the Markets happe, And pay my Coyne, and keepe my minde in quiet; And what I bought, to bring home in my lappe, And when I come home, dresse it for my Dyet. Then in my garden watch a Mowle or Mouse, And haue another planting in my house. 41 I would I were a painter of such Art, As like Appelles, might abuse the Eye: And to the life so set out euery part, That straunge conceits might bee deceiu'd thereby, And I might vse my pensill in such sort As all the world should neuer make report. 42 And yet I would not: for then doe I feare, My heart might fall vpon Idolatry: For while my hand were drawing of a haire, I might be rapt into a thought too high. When thinking to behold an Angels face, Forget the diuell in another place. 43 No, I had rather onely learne to knowe, The difference of my Colours in their kindes: And haue a care, to set my shadowes so, That may not be a hurt to blessèd mindes. And vse my pensill, on my cloath, and boord, And for what price I might my paines affoord. 44 I would I were a Merchant of all wares, That I might furnish all both Rich and poore: And what should fall vnto the Beggars shares, I might haue plenty, alwaies at my doore. My shoppe might be a Market of such state, As all the world may stand and wonder at. 45 And yet I would not: for then doe I feare, I should finde many a Begger in my booke: And when I could my mony not forbeare I might goe hang my credit on a hooke. When if both Towne, and Country came vnto me. In one, or both, some debters would vndo me. 46 No, I would rather be of meane estate, Haue mony alwaies ready in my chest: Be sure to buy my wares at the best rate, And sell good stuffe, and serue my friends the best, And cosen no man, with false weight nor measure, But with true dealing make a poore mans treasure. 47 I would I were a practiser in Phisicke, To know my Simples, Compounds, and my waters, To heale the Rume, the Tooth-ach and the Tisicke. The Coughe, olde Aches, and such other matters, That I might by my skill in generall, Be held the Maister of the Vrinall. 48 And yet I would not: for then day nor night, I should haue quiet scarcely in my bed: And in my Conscience haue full many a fright, To heare my Patient suddenly were dead: When by a Vomit, I had burst his heart Or pur'gde his guttes out through the nether part. 49 No, I had rather bee an Herbalist, To know the Vertue both of Hearbs and Rootes. Then be the bold and desperate Alchymist; That ofte his weight and measure ouer-shootes, And so, by either want of Care or skill, In steede of Curing, giue a killing-Pill. 50 I would I were a high Astronomer, That I might make my walke among the starres: And by my insight might fore-see a farre What were to come, and talke of peace and warres, Of liues and deaths, and wonders to ensue, Although perhaps, but fewe doe fall out true. 51 And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt, With too-much study, I should grow stark mad: When one Conceit would put another out, While giddy braines beyond themselues would gad. And seeking for the man within the Moone, Mistake a morning, for an after-noone. 52 No, I would rather learne no more to knowe; Then of the times and seasons of the yeare: What dayes the Fayres are kept, and how to goe From towne to towne, and euery Sheer, to Sheere. That Tearmers may not their day-note-books slack, And so to make an honest Almanacke. 53 I would I were a rare and sound Ciuillian. And had the Lawes of honest loue by heart: Would not corrupt my conscience for a million, Nor euer pleade, but on the honest part. Examine strictly, and consider duely, And so giue sentence to the matter truly. 54 And yet I would not: for then might I heare, How Truth gets hatred, for her honest minde: And simple-Fees, doe make but sory cheare, While true Plain-dealing hath but barely dinde. When such as know the world, and how to vse it, Seeing a Fee come faire, will not refuse it. 55 I would I were a Scriuener, and could pen, All kinde of writings, write all kinde of hands; Be well acquainted with great Monyed-men, And closely deale for all their goods and Lands. And being furnisht fully, to my pleasure, Play them a trick, to make them loose their Treasure. 56 And yet I would not: for then I am sure, My Conscience would receiue a Mortall-wound: And such a wound as neuer Arte could Cure, By all the feates that euer Scriuener found. When if I scap't mine eares for Forgery, My soule should goe to hell for Vsury. 57 No, I had rather in a Copy booke Write a good sentence for a Schollers reading: Whereon the parents may be glad to looke, And say, God send their hands a happy speeding. And take my mony on the Saterday For all the weeke, then bid my Boyes goe play. 58 I would I were a Trades man, and could sell My wares by weight, and measure as I list: And had such trickes to make my market well, That I might send home fooles with Had-I-wist. That while poore soules did sit with losses crying, I might growe Rich, with swearing, and with lying. 59 And yet I would not: for my Conscience then, Wold make me feele the smart of falshoods woe: When I beheld the ends of faithles men, With what a horror to their Hell they goe. While true plaine-dealing hearts in quiet die, And faithfull loue doth liue Eternally. 60 I would I were a Broker, and for Coyne Tooke any Pawnes, and care not what I tooke For interest, nor how I did pourloyne, So I might get it with the Siluer hooke: Who were the Thiefe, so I might buye the wares, Nor who did shift, so I did get the shares. 61 And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt, Some priuate Eyes, would closely prie into me: And some odde Ladde or Landresse finde me out, And for receiuing stolne goods would vndo me. When with the losse of all my goods, scarce hope, To be so happy, as to scape the Rope. 62 No, I had rather trie a better trade, Whereby to make some honest kinde of gaine: Whereby some better reckoning may be made, Then buy Repentance with so great a paine. Now fie vpon them Brokers, Bawdes, and Theeues, Make poore men weare their Ierkins without sleeues. 63 I would I were a close promoting Mate, To picke a hole in each offenders Coat: And make a shew of seruice to the State, When I would purse vp many a priuy groat: But in great Summes follow my Information, Till I were well paide for a Reformation. 64 And yet I would not: for then euery knaue Would single me out, for a secret friend: And teach me how to play the cunning slaue, To bring my busines to a wretched ende. While hellish Craft with Cloke of heresie, Might hide a world of foule iniquitie. 65 No, I would rather learne my selfe t'amend What is amisse, and so my friends aduise; Then when I see an other man offend, In secret seeke his ruine to deuise. And making shew to seeke the good of all, Set vp my selfe, with many thousands fall. 66 I would I were a Tapster, fill my pot Halfe vp with froth, and make my gaine of drinke: And make no care, how I my mony got, So I might heare my gold and siluer chinke. Make more of Drunkardes then of better men, By putting off bad licour now and then. 67 And yet I would not: for then should I be, At Call and Checke of euery Iacke and Gill: And many a Lobcocke would looke into me, What drinke I drew, how I my pot did fill: And sometime trust so farre vpon the score, I scarce should put my head out of the doore. 68 No, I had rather runne another Race, Though for lesse profit, yet for more content: That both with God and man, might be in Grace, Wherein my time might be more happily spent. And rather pay, my penny for my pot, Then cosen twenty people for a groat. 69 I would I were as tall, and stout a man, As euer drewe a sword out of a sheath: That I might see, who durst come neere my Canne, Or speake a word, where I but seeme to breath. Or fortune durst, but crosse me with her wheeles, For feare to see, her braines about her heeles. 70 And yet I would not: for then where should I Bestowe my selfe? why euery man would flie me: I should be sure to haue no company, Where none that loue themselues, that will come nigh me, And fortune would be sure to fit me so, That she wold some way seeke mine ouerthrow. 71 I would I were a Trauellor, to passe The Roughest Seas, and card'e for winde and weather: And might arriue, where neuer Creature was, But Beasts, and Birds, that liue and feede together: And tell at home what I abroad haue seene, Where neuer man yet but my selfe had beene. 72 And yet I would not: for I feare that fewe Would trust my stories, were they nere so true: Words are but winde, and winde is but a Dewe, Farre Trauellers may say the blacke is Blewe. Although perhaps some simple soules may say, Surely this man hath trauailde a great way; 73 No, I will rather trye my Fortunes heere, And to my best aduantage vse my wittes: Then runne abroad, and buye Repentance deere, Knowing how ofte, vnhappily Fortune hittes. When Weather-beaten Sailes, with winde, and raine, Scarce make a Sauing-Voyage home againe. 74 I would I were a Player, and could act As many partes as came vpon a Stage: And in my braine, could make a full Compact, Of all that passeth betwixt Youth and Age; That I might haue fiue-shares in euery Play And let them laugh, that beare the Bell-away. 75 And yet I would not: For then doe I feare, If I should gall some Goos-cappe with my speech: That he would freat and fume, and chafe, and sweare, As if some Flea had bit him by the Breech. And in some passion, or strange Agonie Disturbe both mee, and all the Companie. 76 I would I were a Poet, and could write, The passages of this Paltry world in rime: And talke of Warres, and many a valiant fight, And how the Captaines did to Honor clime. Of Wise, and Faire, of Gratious, Vertuous, kinde, And of the bounty of a noble minde. 77 But speake but little of the life of Loue, Because it is a thing so harde to finde: And touch but little at the Turtle-Doue, Seeing there are but fewe Byrdes of that kinde. And Libell against leawde and wicked harts, That on the earth, doe play the Diuells-parts. 78 And yet I would not: for then would my braines, Be with a world of toyes Intoxicate: And I should fall vpon a thousand vaines, Of this and that, and well I know not what. When some would say, that saw my Frantick fittes, Surely the Poet is beside his wittes. 79 I would I were an honest Countrey-Wench, That only could make Curtsey, smoile, and blush, And sit me downe vpon a good-Ale bench, And answere wanton Tomkin, with a Tush. And well, Go-too, and How-now? Pary-away, And for a Tanzey, goe to Stoole-Ball-play. 80 And yet I would not: For then doe I feare, My louers would be out of loue with mee: If I would not belieue them when they sweare, That I am shee, and I am onely shee, Of all the Maydes, before the Church-house dore; That hath their harts; and what can I haue more? 81 No, I had rather be an honest wife, And loue my husband, and looke to my house: And with my Neighbours leade a quiet life, And keepe a Cat, to driue away the Mouse. Hatch vp my Chickins, pen vp my clocke-Henne, And haue nothing to doe with naughtie men. 82 I would I were the gallanst Courtizan, That euer put a foure-Ear'de Asse to schoole: That I might cleane put downe Maide Marian, And neuer be without my dainty foole. And make my mony Baggs come tumbling to me, And glad to see what seruice they can doe me. 83 And yet I would not: for then doe I doubt, Some Cunstable, or Beadle of Bridewell: By some olde Bawde, would surely find me out, When for his silence, I should pay full well. Or Cart it to the place of youthes Correction, Where chopping Chalke, would quite spoile my Complexion. 84 No, I had rather be an honest Maide, That neuer knewe any [of] loues delight: And of a man, almost to be afraide, Then seeme to set my Maidenhead so light. As for a wicked choise, to chaunge my name, To fit me onely, with a fie for shame. 85 I would I were a Bruer, and could make My water pay the charges of my Malt: And for small Beere, the price of strong beere take. And helpe a musty Barrell with bay salt. Keepe leaking vessells, stoppe them vp with Clay: The drinke may runne out, when the Earth's away. 86 And yet I would not: for then I should thinke, If I should take good mony for ill Beere: My Customers would curse me for my drinke, And say I solde both that was naught, and deere. And one so driue an other daily fro me, That in the ende they would quite ouerthrow me. 87 No, I had rather truly pay my penny For my full pot of either Ale or Beere: Then seeke the hurt or spoiling of a many, Or to vndoe the poore in a deere yeere. Or make them say, whose trust I doe abuse, O wicked Bruer, looke what drinke he brues. 88 I would I were an excellent Diuine, That had the Bible at my fingers ends: The world might heare out of this mouth of mine, How God did make his enemies his friends. I were so follow'de, as if none but I, Could plainely speake of true Diuinity. 89 And yet I would not: for then ten to one, I should be call'd but a Precizian: Or Formalist, and might goe preach alone, Vnto my holy brother Puritan. And so be flouted for my zealous loue In taking paines for other mens behoue. 90 No, I had rather reade, and vnderstand The Rules of Grace, that haue the learnèd led: To know the power of the Almighty hand, And with what foode, the blessèd flocke are fed. Rather then with a thundring and long praier, To leade into presumption, or dispaire. 91 I would I were a man of warlike might, And had the Title of a Generall: To point the Captaines euery one their fight, Where should the Vangard, and the Rereward fall: Who should be leaders of the forlorne hope, And who the Entrance to the Army ope. 92 And yet I would not: for then I might see, How discontent might cause a Mutinie: Whereby the Army might in danger be, To be surprizèd by the Enemy. Or by the losse of men, for honors gaine, To wound my Conscience with a bloody paine. 93 No, I had rather praise the Course of peace, And study how to helpe to holde the same: And how soone quarrells ill begun may cease, And how to keepe accord in quiet frame. That olde and young may liue contented so, That to their graues, all may in quiet goe. 94 I would I were the Miserablest wretch That euer Crambde vp mony in his Chest: That I might learne, but like a dogge to fetch Lambes from the Folde, and Duckelings from the nest And when I tooke the paines to plucke and pull, Know how to gaine, by Feathers, and by wooll. 95 And yet I would not: least while I did liue, I should scarce trust my selfe with that I haue: I should not heare the word of Lend, nor giue, But only studie, how to get and saue. And when I die, haue written on my doore, The Dogge is Dambn'de, that preyde vpon the poore. 96 I would I were the strangest Prodigall, That euer strew'de his mony in the street: That I might make the Beggers merry all, When they but sawe the shadowe of my feet. And Churles might chafe, to see me so to throw Away the wealth, that they did scrape for so. 97 And yet I would not: least when all were gone, My Stocke, my goods, my Leases, and my Lands It sure would breake my heart to looke vpon, My whole estate to be in others hands. And then to hide me in some secret place, Or grieue to death, to thinke of my disgrace. 98 I would I were so neate and Spruse a Noddy, As all in print, might speake, and looke, and walke And so become for euery idle body, A kinde of Table, or a Stable-talke. And say to see me, tripping on the Toe, The Fool's so prowd, he knows not how to goe. 99 And yet I would not: least some Wood-cock-asse, To equall me in my Ciuilitie: Might paint, and princke himselfe vp in a glasse. And studie counterfeit Gentilitie. And so perhaps put mee into some passion, To see my fashion, growe so out of fashion. 100 No, I will rather wisely looke about me, And weare both what and how might fit my state And haue a care within, what were without me, I might not be an Owle, to wonder at. But I might passe through all the Pide-coat-throng, And bee no Taber for an idle-toong. 101 I would I were a Beastly-Epicure, That car'de for nothing but to eate and drinke: And talke of nought but Natures-Nouriture, And filling vp my Flagons to the brinke. Of lusty swallowes, and of pleasing taste, And make no care how much got meat I waste. 102 And yet I would not: least the world should say, Looke, yonder goes a barrell full of Beere: Who gulls in more good victualls in one day, Then might suffize an honest man a yeere. And ere he dye, it will (no doubt) be found, The Beast did burst, and stunck aboue the ground. 103 No, I had rather keepe a better Dyet, And liue with Bread and water all my life: Then in my Guttes to keepe so great a Ryot, And in my Stomacke haue so sore a strife. That I should puffe, and blow, and swell, and sweat, And be halfe-dead, ere I disgest my meat. 104 I would I were a man of all mens mindes, My Wit were drawne into all kinde of passions: And my Conceyts were all of sundry kindes, My Cloathes made after all-Countrey-fashions. I knew the secret of all Natures-sence, And so of Earth, and all her Excellence. 105 And yet I would not: for then sure should I, Be all too gaz'd at wheresoere I goe: And like the poore bare-feather'd Æsops-Pye, When euery Byrd did her owne-feather knowe. Be followèd with many a flowting-lacke, Or Rauens feathers all pull'd from my backe. 106 No, I had rather weare but home-spun-thread, And haue my Cloathes close vpon my Breech: And by my Labours-toyle to get my bread, And vse no other but my Countrey-speech. And rather haue a Foole thinke mee a foole, Then craftie work-men know me by my Toole. 107 I would I were the truest-hearted woman, That euer spake with a most pleasing Toung: And neuer meane to giue offence to no man, Nor neuer thrust into an idle throng. But so haue care of all my Cariage, It may be helpe vnto my Mariage. 108 And yet I would not: for then euery Maide, Within our towne, would stand and laugh at me: And call me Foole, and say I were afraide, To know what in an honest man might be. For shee that will not looke ere shee did leape, Might curse the Trades-man, though his Ware were cheape. 109 No, I had rather be a reasonable, True, Honest, Witty, merry-Bony-Kate, That would not feare the Constable, To see him looke in at our window-Grate. As many Wenches will be now and then, That haue bene medling with too-many men. 110 I would I were the rarest Politician, That euer plotted for preheminence: And of the Doggedst disposition, That euer was in Natures residence. And car'de not how the worlde to Ruine went, So I might onely purchase my Content. 111 And yet I would not: For then doe I feare, Some sudden-flash from Heau'n would fall vpon me: And all the world reioyce to see and heare, In helples griefe, how I am woe begon me. When I of force should bid the world Fare-well, And Death were sent to summon mee to Hell. 112 No, I had rather keepe the plaine High-way, That leades the soule to her Eternall rest: Then by Illusion, seeke out a wry-way, To hatche my Egges vp, in the Diuells-nest. And with the Worlde, when I had made an ende; To finde in Heau'n an Euerlasting-Friende. 113 I would I were, and yet I would not too, Because I know not, that's I know not what: And when I would doe, then I cannot doe, When that would put out this, this put out that. And such strange Fancies would my spirit feede, That in the ende, I should grow mad indeede. 114 Then let me see if I at least can see, What may be seene, that worthie to be seene: Wherein might be, and onely there might bee, That alwayes hath bene, and hath onely beene. In true Conceit, in state of Comforts store, Where I would be, and say, would not no more. 115 Yea, that were such a thing indeed to finde, As one might seeke vntill his Eyes were out: With all the strength both of his heart and minde, And trauell ouer all the Earth about. And noting Natures workes, and worth in all, Finde all as nothing, or to nothing fall. 116 Yet there is something wheresoere it is, And it is some-where, and no-where, but there: Where all is well, and nothing is amisse, But yonder, here and there, and euery-where. Where the bright-Eyes of Blessed-Soules may see, Where all the Ioyes of Hearts and Soules may bee. 117 But wher is this same, where? that wold be known, And where is this same knowledge to be found? And where is such a seede of Science sowne? And where is such a blessèd piece of ground? And where is such a Blessing to be sought, That for that worth, sets all the world at nought. 118 Where all the pride of Beawtie is put downe, While Natures Reason must subscribe to Grace: And Wit and Will, may wander vp and downe, And Vertue onely keepes a Glorious place. Where shee alone vnto her Seruants showes, Where all the comfort of the spirit goes. 119 Yea, there alone the heart and soule may finde, The sacred Summe of their Eternall-Sweete: Which gladdes the soule, the spirit, and the minde, Where all the Graces do together meete. And altogether, doe agree in one, To sing in Glorie to their GOD alone. 120 What? neither great, nor wise, nor Rich, nor faire? What would I be then? might I as I would: I would not be a Moate amidst the Ayre, Nor yet a Mowle, to digge within the ground. Nor Byrd, nor Beast, that can but eate, and sleepe, Nor like a Baby, can but laugh and weepe. 121 Nor like a Bowby, without wit or sence, Nor like a Baboune, for a Bearardes whippe: Nor like a Lowse, in Beggars Residence, Nor like a Flea, that can but leepe and skippe. Nor like a worme, but to be troden on, Nor like a Gue-Gaw, to be gaz'de vpon. 122 Nor would I be a Byrd within a Cage, Nor Dogge in Kennell, nor a Bore in Stye: Nor Crab-Tree-staffe, to leane vpon for Age, Nor wicked Liue, to leade a Youth awrye. Nor like a Flooke, that floates but with the Fludde, Nor like an Eele, that liues but in the mudde. 123 Nor would I haue the Crane picke out mine Eyes, Nor Pyes, nor Parats, teach me how to prate: Nor fill my Pawnche too-full of Wood-cock-pyes, Nor haue Madge-Howlet make me watch too-late. Nor let the Cuckooe learne me how to sing, Nor with a Buzzarde, make too Lowe a wing. 124 Nor would I be a Catte, to hunt a Mowse, Nor yet a Ferret, to goe hunt a Cony: Nor yet an Ape, to stand and looke a Lowse, Nor yet a Sheepes-head to be solde for mony. Nor yet a Hawke, to seize vpon a Ducke, Nor yet a Nurse, to giue a Baby sucke. 125 Nor would I write vpon the death of Dogges, And say here lyes a good olde-stinking Curre: Cut lusty faces out of rotten Logges, Nor of an Owles-skinne, make an Ape a Furre. Nor teach a Byrde to whistle in a Cage, Nor be a Ministrell at a Marriage. 126 Nor teach a Cat, to hunt a Mowse drye-foote, Nor a young Squyrrell how to clime a Reede: A Skarre-crow in a Garden how to shoote, Nor a blinde-Harper, how a Song to reade. Nor how a Flea may scape the Fingers endes, Nor how a Lowse may liue among her Friends. 127 Nor would I be a golden Alchymist, To studie the Phylosophers faire stone: And feede a sight of Fooles, with Had-I-wist, To weepe for Siluer, when theyr Golde is gone, Poope noddy, neuer was there such an other, To make a Couzen of a simple Brother. 128 Nor would I bee a Foole when all is done, To weare Pyed Coats, Turn-spit, and eat fat-meat: Follow my master, dandle his young Sonne, And tell my Mistris, who the Foole did beat. That she might chide her Wenches euery one, For medling with her Foole, when she was gone. 129 Nor sing new Ballads, nor make Countrey-games, Nor set vp sights, were neuer seene before: Nor walke among my crue of Cursed-Dames, And bee a Pander to a Paltry-Whore: No, Pandarisme is so poore a Trade, That none but Beggars, bargaine for a lade. 130 No, I would not bee any one of these, Nor any of this wretched worlds delight: I would not so my spirits comforts leese, To haue mine Eyes bewitcht from heauenly light. No, I would haue an other World then this, Where I would seeke for my Eternal-Blisse. 131 And till I come vnto that Glorious place, Where all Contents doe ouercome the heart: And loue doth liue in Euerliuing-Grace, While Greatest Ioy doth feele no smallest smart. But GOD is all in all, to his belouèd, The Sweet of soules, that sweetest soules haue prouèd. 132 To tell you truely, what I wish to bee, And neuer would be other, if I could: But in comfort of the Heau'ns Decree, In soule and bodie that I euer should. Though in the world, not to the world to liue, But to my GOD, my seruice wholly giue. 133 This would I be, and would none other be, But a Religious seruant of my God: And knowe there is none other God but he, And willingly to suffer mercies Rod. Ioy in his Grace, and liue but in his Loue, And seeke my blisse but in the heauen aboue. 134 And I would frame a kinde of faithfull praier, For all estates within the state of Grace: That carefull loue might neuer know despaire, No[r] seruile feare might faithfull loue deface. And this would I both day and night deuise, To make my humble Spirits Exercise. 135 And I would reade the rules of sacred Life, Perswade the troubled soule to patience: The husband, Care, and Comfort to the wife, To Childe and seruant, due obedience. Faith to the friend, and to the Neighbour peace, That loue might liue, and quarrels all may cease. 136 Pray for the health of all that are deceased, Confession vnto all that are Conuicted: And patience vnto all, that are displeased, And comfort vnto all, that are afflicted. And mercy vnto all, that haue offended, And Grace to all, that all may he amended. 137 Pray for the King, the Queene, and Countries health, Their Royall issue, and Peeres of Estate: The Counsaile, Cleargy, and the Common-wealth, That no misfortune may their blisse abate. But that, th' Almighty so his Church will cherish, That not a member of his Loue may perish. 138 Wish [euery] King, to haue King Dauids heart, And euery Queene, the Queene of Shebaes wit: And euery Councell Salomons best part, Of vnderstanding, for a Kingdome fit. And euery Lady, faire Rebeccaes face, And euery Virgin, the wise Virgins Grace. 139 And euery Souldiour, Iosuahs true spirit, And euery Scholler, Aarons eloquence: And euery Miser, wicked Diues merits, And euery poore man, Iobs true patience. And euery Lawyer, Maries heau'nly minde, And euery Merchant, of Zacheus kinde. 140 Doe not with Esaw, hunt for venizon, And sell thy birthright for a messe of pottage: Lest Iacob steale away thy benison, When Isaach falls vpon the yeeres of dotage. But be a Ioseph in the time of neede, To good olde Iacob, and his blessèd seede. 141 Be Abraham in obedient sacrifice, And follow Lot in his loues holines: Like Salomon, be in thy Iudgement, wise, And Ionathan in friendships faithfulnes, Like Henoch make thy Ioy of heauenly loue And with Eliah liue in Heau'n aboue. 142 And diet not with Holofernes drinke, But follow Iudith, in her ioyfull strength: Let Dalila, not make stout Sampson winke; Lest the Philistines fall on thee at length. Nor Salmon be led with Pharaohs Childe, Lest by the flesh, the spirit be beguilde. 143 Be both a Priest, a Prophet, and a King, A Priest to make thy selfe a Sacrifice: A Prophet, to declare the way to bring The blessèd Spirit, vnto Paradise. A King to rule thy selfe, with such direction, Thy Soule may keepe thy body in subiection. 144 Know what, and how, and where, and when to speake, Be fearefull, how thou doest thy God offend: A vertuous vow, take heed thou doest not breake, And mercies pleasure willingly attend. Holde backe thy Hand from all vnlawfull Action And weane thy Spirit, from vngodly Faction. 145 Flatter not folly, with an idle faith. Nor let earth stand vpon her owne desart: But shew what wisedome in the Scripture saith. The fruitfull hand, doth shew the faithfull hart. Beleeue the word, and thereto bend thy will, And teach obedience for a blessed skill. 146 Chide sinners, as the father doth his childe, And keepe them in the Awe of louing feare: Make sinne most hatefull, but in words be milde: That humble patience may the better heare: And wounded conscience may receiue reliefe, When true repentance pleades the sinners griefe. 147 Yet flatter not the foule delight of sinne, But make it loathsome in the Eie of Loue: And seeke the hart with holy thoughts to winne, Vnto the best way to the soules behoue. So teach, so liue, that both in word and deede, The world may Ioy thy heau'nly rules to reade. 148 Heale the infect of sinne, with oile of Grace, And wash the Soule, with true Contritions teares: And when Confession shewes her heauy Case, Deliuer faith from all Infernall feares. That when high Iustice threatens sinne with death, Mercy againe may giue Repentance breath. 149 Sit not with Sathan, on the Horse of pride, But see sweet Iesus sitting on an Asse: Better on foote, then fowly so to ride, As with the Diuell into hell to passe. There is no meane, but either heau'n or hell, For on this Earth must no man euer dwell. 150 Time hath a course, which nature cannot stay, For youth must die, or come to doting Age: What is our life on Earth? but as a play, Where many a part doth come vpon the Stage. Rich, poore, wise, fond, faire, fowle, and great and smal And olde, and young, death makes an ende of al. 151 Where he that makes his life a Comedy, To laugh, and sing, and talke away the time: May finde it in the ende a Tragedy, When mournefull Bells doe make no merry chime. When sad despaire shall feare Infernall euill, While Sinne and death, are Agents for the diuel. 152 But doe not Raue, nor Raile, nor stampe, nor stare, As if thy care would goe to cuffes with sinne: But shew how mercy doth Repentance spare, While working faith, doth heau'nly fauour winne. And loues obedience to the law doth proue, The chosen Soule, that God doth chiefly loue. 153 Thus would I spend in seruice of my God, The lingring howres of these fewe daies of mine, To shew how sinne and death are ouertrod, But by the vertue of the power diuine. Our thoughts but vaine, our substance slime and dust. And onely Christ, for our Eternall trust. 154 This would I be, and say, would not, no more, But onely not, be otherwise then this: All in effect, but as I said before, The life in that life's kingdomes loue of his. My glorious God, whose grace all comfort giues. Then be on Earth, the greatest man that liues. FINIS.</field>

Sweete fellow whom I sware, such sure affected loue, As neither weale, nor woe, nor want, can from my minde remoue. To thee, my fellow sweete, this wofull tale I tell, To let thee see the darke distresse, wherein my minde doth dwel. On loathêd bed I lay, my lustlesse lims to rest, Where still I tumble to and fro, to seeke which side were best: At last I catch a place, where long I cannot lie, But strange conceits from quiet sleepes, do keep awake mine eie. The time of yeere me seemes, doth bid me (slouen) rise, And not from shew of sweete delight, to shut my sleepie eies: But sorrow by and by, doth bid me, slaue, lie still, And slug amonst the wretchèd souls, whom care doth seek to kil. For sorow is my spring, which brings forth bitter teares, The fruits of friendship all forlorne, as feeble fancie feares. A Strange Description of a Rare Garden Plot. Written by N. B. Gent. My garden ground of griefe; where selfewils seeds are sowne, Whereof comes vp the weedes of wo, that ioies haue ouergrown: With patience palèd round, to keep in secret spright; And quickset round about with care, to keepe out all delight. Foure quarters squarèd out, I finde in sundrie sort; Whereof according to their kindes, I meane to make report: The first, the knot of loue, drawne euen by desier, Like as it were two harts in one, and yet both would be nier. The herbe is calde Isop, the iuice of such a taste, As with the sowre, makes sweete conceits to flie away too fast: The borders round about, are set with priuie sweete, Where nueer bird but nightingale, presumde to set hir feete. From this I stept aside, vnto the knot of care, Which so was crost with strange c?ceits, as tong cannot declare: The herbe was callèd Time, which set out all that knot. And like a Maze me thought it was, when in the crookes I got. The borders round about, are Sauerie vnsweete: An herbe not much, in my conceit, for such a knot vnmeete: From this to friendships knot, I stept and tooke the view, How it was drawne, and then againe, in order how it grew. The course was not vnlike, a kinde of hand in hand: But many fingers were away, that there should seeme to stand: The herbe that set the knot, was Pennie Riall round: And as me seem'd, it grew full close, and nere vnto the ground. And parchèd heere and there, so that it seemèd not Full as it should haue been in deed, a perfect friendship knot: Heerat I pawsd awhile, and tooke a little view Of an od quarter drawne in beds, where herbs and flowers grew. The flowres were buttons fine, for batchelors to beare, And by those flowres ther grew an herb, was callèd maiden hear. Amid this garden ground, a Condit strange I found, Which water fetcht from sorows spring, to water al the ground: To this my heauie house, the dungeon of distresse, Where fainting hart lies panting still, despairing of redresse. Where from this window loe, this sad prospect I haue, A piece of ground whereon to gaze, would bring one to his graue: Lo thus the welcome spring, that others landes delight, Doth make me die, to thinke I lie, thus drownèd in despight. That vp I cannot rise, and come abrode to thee, My fellow sweet, with whom God knowes, how oft I wish to bee: And thus in haste, adieu, my hart is growne so sore; And care so crookes my fingers ends, that I can write no more. An Excellent Dreame of Ladies and their Riddles: By N. B. Gent. In Orchard grounds, where store of fruit trees grew, Me thought a Saint was walking all alone, Of euerie tree, she seemd to take hir view, But in the end, she pluckèd but of one: This fruit quoth she, doth like my fancie best: Sweetings are fruit, but let that apple rest. Such fruit (quoth I) shall fancie chiefly feede: Indeede tis faire, God grant it prooue as good, But take good heede, least all to late it breede Ill humors, such as may infect your blood: Yet take, and taste, but looke you know the tree: Peace, foole quoth she, and so awakèd mee. What was this ground, wherein this dame did walke? And what was she, that romèd to and fro? And what ment I, to vse such kinde of talke? And what ment she, to checke and snib me so? But what meane I? alas, I was asleepe: Awake I sweare, I will more silence keepe. Well thus I wakte and fell asleepe againe: And then I fell into another vaine. Great wars me thought grew late by strange mishap, Desire had stolne out of Dianaes traine, Her darling deere, and laid on Venus lap, Who, Cupid sware should neuer backe againe. Ere he would so loose all his harts delight, He vow'd to die, wherewith began a fight. Diana shot, and Cupid shot againe: Fame sounded out hir trumpe with heauenly cheare: Hope was ill hurt, despite was onely slaine: Diana forst in fine for to retire. Cupid caught fame, and brought hir to his frend. The trumpet ceast, and so my dreame did end. Thus scarce awake, I fell asleepe againe, And then I was within a garden ground, Beset with flowres, the allies euen and plaine: And all the banks beset with roses round, And sundrie flowres so super sweete of smell, As there me thought it was a heauen to dwell. Where walking long, anon I gan espie Sweete pretie soules, that pluckt ech one a flowre: When from their sight I hid me by and by, Behinde a banke within a brier bowre. Where after walke, I saw them where they sat: Beheld their hues, and heard their pretie chat: Sister quoth one, how shall we spend this day? Deuise (quoth she) some pretie merie iest: Content quoth one, beshrew them that say nay: Some purposes or riddles I thinke best: Riddles cried all, and so the sport begun: Forfet a fillop, she that first hath done. Loe thus awhile was curtsey to propound; Yet in the end this order did they take, By two and two, they should sit close and round; And one begin, another answere make: Where ridling sports in order as I can, I will recite; and thus the first began. The First Riddle. Within a gallant plot of ground, There growes a flowre that hath no name, The like whereof was neuer found, And none but one can plucke the same: Now where this ground or flowre doth growe, Or who that one, tis hard to knowe. The Answere. Sister (quoth she) if thou wouldst knowe, This ground, this flowre, and happle man, Walke in this garden to and fro: Here you shall see them now and than: Which when you finde to your delight, Then thinke I hit your riddle right. The Second Riddle. Within a field there growes a flowre, That decks the ground where as it growes, It springs and falls, both in an howre, And but at certaine times it showes: It neuer dies, and seldome seene, And tis a Nosegay for a Queene. The Answere. This field is fauor, Grace the ground, Whence springs the flowre of curtesie, Soone growne and gone, though somtime found, Not dead, but hid, from flattrers eie, That pickthanks may not plucke the same: Thus haue I red your riddle Dame. The Third Riddle. Within a flowre a seede there growes, Which somtime falls, but seldome springs, And if it spring, it seldome blowes, And if it blowe, no sweete it brings, And therefore counted but a weede: Now gesse the flowre, and what the seede. The Answere. In fancies flowre is sorrowes seede, Which somtimes fall, but springs but seeld, And if it spring, tis but a weede, Which doth no sweete, nor sauor yeeld; And yet the flowre, both faire and sweete, And for a Princes garden meete. The Fourth Riddle. Within a seede doth poison lurke, Which onely Spiders feede vpon, And yet the Bee can wisely woorke, To sucke out honie, poison gone: Which honie, poison, Spider, Bee, Are hard to gesse, yet eath to see. The Answere. In sorrowes seede is secret paine, Which spite, the Spider, onely sucks, Which poison gone, then wittie braine The wilie Bee, hir honie plucks, And beares it to hir hiue vnhurt, When spider trod, dies in the durt. Gramercie, wench (quoth she) that first begoon, Each one me seemes hath quit hir selfe right well, And now since that our riddles all are doon, Let vs go sing the flowre of sweetest smell: Well may it fare, wherewith each tooke a part, And thus they soong, all with a merie hart. Blest be the ground that first brought forth the flowre, Whose name vntolde, but vertues not vnknowne: Happie the hand, whom God shall giue the powre, To plucke this flowre, and take it for his owne: Oh heauenly stalke, that staines all where it growes: From whom more sweet, than sweetest hony flowes. Oh sweete of sweetes, the sweetest sweete that is: Oh flowre of flowres, that yeelds so sweete a sent: Oh sent so sweete, as when the head shall misse: Oh heauens what hart but that will sore lament: God let thee spring, and flourish so each howre, As that our sweetes may neuer turne to sowre. For we with sweetes doe feede our fancies so, With sweetes of sight, and sweetnes of conceit, That we may wish that it may euer groe, Amid delights where we desire to wait, Vpon the flowre that pleaseth euerie eie, And glads each hart; God let it neuer die. Wherewith me thought alowd I cride, Amen: And therewithall I started out of sleepe: Now what became of these faire Ladies then, I cannot tell, in minde I onely keepe These ridling toies which heere I do recite: Ile tell ye more perhaps another night. The Chesse Play. Very aptly deuised By N. B. Gent. A Secret many yeeres vnseene, In play at Chesse, who knowes the game, First of the King, and then the Queene, Knight, Bishop, Rooke, and so by name, Of euerie Pawne I will descrie, The nature with the qualitie. The King. The King himselfe is haughtie Care, Which ouerlooketh all his men, And when he seeth how they fare, He steps among them now and then, Whom when his foe presumes to checke, His seruants stand, to giue the necke. The Queene. The Queene is queint, and quicke Conceit, Which makes hir walke which way she list, And rootes them vp, that lie in wait To worke hir treason, ere she wist: Hir force is such, against hir foes, That whom she meetes, she ouerthrowes. The Knight. The Knight is knowledge how to fight Against his Princes enimies, He neuer makes his walke outright, But leaps and skips, in wilie wise, To take by sleight a traitrous foe, Might slilie seeke their ouerthrowe. The Bishop. The Bishop he is wittie braine, That chooseth Crossest pathes to pace, And euermore he pries with paine, To see who seekes him most disgrace: Such straglers when he findes astraie, He takes them vp, and throwes awaie. The Rookes. The Rookes are reason on both sides, Which keepe the corner houses still, And warily stand to watch their tides, By secret art to worke their will, To take sometime a theefe vnseene, Might mischiefe meane to King or Queene. The Pawnes. The Pawne before the King, is peace, Which he desires to keepe at home, Practise, the Queenes, which doth not cease Amid the world abroad to roame, To finde, and fall vpon each foe, Whereas his mistres meanes to goe. Before the Knight, is perill plast, Which he, by skipping ouergoes, And yet that Pawne can worke a cast, To ouerthrow his greatest foes; The Bishops, prudence, prieng still, Which way to worke his masters will. The Rookes poore Pawnes, are sillie swaines, Which seeldome serue, except by hap, And yet those Pawnes, can lay their traines, To catch a great man, in a trap: So that I see, sometime a groome May not be sparèd from his roome. The Nature of the Chesse men. The King is stately, looking hie; The Queene, doth beare like maiestie: The Knight, is hardie, valiant, wise: The Bishop, prudent and precise: The Rookes, no raungers out of raie, The Pawnes, the pages in the plaie. Lenvoy. Then rule with care, and quicke conceit, And fight with knowledge, as with force; So beare a braine, to dash deceit, And worke with reason and remorse: Forgiue a fault, when yoong men plaie, So giue a mate, and go your way. And when you plaie beware of Checke, Know how to saue and giue a necke: And with a Checke, beware of Mate; But cheefe, ware had I wist too late: Loose not the Queene, for ten to one, If she be lost, the game is gone. A Most Excellent Passion. Set Downe By N. B. Gent. Com yonglings com, that seem to make such mone, About a thing of nothing God he knowes: With sighes and sobs, and many a greeuous grone, And trickling teares, that secret sorow shewes, Leaue, leaue to faine, and here behold indeed, The onely man, may make your harts to bleed. Whose state to tell; no, neuer toong can tell: Whose woes are such; oh no, there are none such: Whose hap so hard; nay rather halfe a hell: Whose griefe so much: yea God he knowes too much: Whose wofull state, and greeuous hap (alas), The world may see, is such as neuer was. Good nature weepes to see hir selfe abused; Ill fortune shewes hir furie in hir face: Poore reason pines to see hir selfe refused: And dutie dies, to see his sore disgrace. Hope hangs the head, to see dispaire so neere; And what but death can end this heauie cheere? O cursèd cares, that neuer can be knowne: Dole, worse than death, when neuer tong can tell it: The hurt is hid, although the sorow showne, Such is my paine, no pleasure can expell it. In summe, I see I am ordainèd I: To liue in dole, and so in sorow die. Behold each teare, no token of a toy: But torments such, as teare my hart asunder: Each sobbing sigh, a signe of such annoy, That how I liue, beleue mee tis a wonder. Each grone, a gripe, that makes me gaspe for breath: And euerie straine, a bitter pang of death. Loe thus I liue, but looking still to die: And still I looke, but still I see in vaine: And still in vaine, alas, I lie and crie: And still I crie, but haue no ease of paine. So still in paine, I liue, looke, lie, and crie: When hope would helpe, or death would let me die. Sometime I sleepe, a slumber, not a sleepe: And then I dreame (God knowes) of no delight, But of such woes, as makes me lie and weepe Vntill I wake, in such a pitious plight; As who beheld me sleeping or awaking, Would say my heart were in a heauie taking. Looke as thè dew doth lie vpon the ground, So sits the sweate of sorrow on my face: Oh deadly dart, that strooke so deepe a wound, Oh hatefull hap, to hit in such a place: The hart is hurt, and bleedes the bodie ouer: Yet cannot die, nor euer health recouer. Then he or she, that hath a happie hand, To helpe a hart, that hath no hope to liue: Come, come with speede, and do not staying stand: But if no one, can any comfort giue, Run to the Church, and bid the Sexton toule A solemne knell, yet for a silie soule. Harke how it sounds, that sorrow lasteth long: Long, long: long long: long long, and longer yet: Oh cruell Death; thou doost me double wrong, To let me lie so long in such a fit: Yet when I die, write neighbors where I lie; Long was I dead, ere death would let me die. II.—From ‘England's Helicon:’ 1600. Phillida and Coridon. In the merry moneth of May, In a morne by breake of day, Foorth I walkèd by the Wood side, Whenas May was in his pride: There I spièd all alone, Phillida and Coridon. Much a-doo there was, God wot, He would loue, and she would not. She sayd neuer man was true, He sayd, none was false to you. He sayd, he had lou'd her long, She sayd, Loue should haue no wrong. Coridon would kisse her then, She said, Maides must kisse no men, Till they did for good and all. Then she made the Sheepheard call All the heauens to witnesse truth: Neuer lou'd a truer youth. Thus with many a pretty oath, Yea and nay, and faith and troth, Such as silly Sheepheards vse, When they will not Loue abuse; Loue, which had beene long deluded, Was with kisses sweete concluded. And Phillida with garlands gay: Was made the Lady of the May. N. Breton. A Pastorall of Phillis and Coridon. On a hill there growes a flower, faire befall the dainty sweete: By that flower there is a Bower, where the heauenly Muses meete. In that Bower there is a chaire, frindgèd all about with gold: Where dooth sit the fairest faire, that euer eye did yet behold. It is Phillis, faire and bright, shee that is the Sheepheards ioy: Shee that Venus did despight, and did blind her little boy. This is she, the wise, the rich, that the world desires to see: This is ipsa quæ, the which, there is none but onely shee. Who would not this face admire? who would not this Saint adore? Who would not this sight desire, though he thought to see no more? Oh faire eyes, yet let me see, one good looke, and I am gone: Looke on me, for I am hee, thy poore silly Coridon. Thou that art the Sheepheards Queene, looke vpon thy silly Swaine: By thy comfort haue beene seene dead men brought to life againe. N. Breton. A sweete Pastorall. Good Muse rock me asleepe, with some sweet Harmonie: This wearie eye is not to keepe thy warie companie. Sweete Loue be gone a while, thou knowest my heauines: Beauty is borne but to beguile, my hart of happines. See how my little flocke that lou'd to feede on hie: Doo headlong tumble downe the Rocke, and in the Vallie die. The bushes and the trees that were so fresh and greene: Doo all their dainty colour leese, and not a leafe is seene. The Black-bird and the Thrush, that made the woods to ring: With all the rest, are now at hush, and not a noate they sing. Sweete Philomele the bird, that hath the heauenly throate, Dooth now alas not one affoord recording of a noate. The flowers haue had a frost, each hearbe hath lost her sauour: And Phillida the faire hath lost, the comfort of her fauour. Now all these carefull sights, so kill me in conceite: That how to hope vpon delights it is but meere deceite. And therefore my sweete Muse that knowest what helpe is best, Doo now thy heauenly cunning vse, to set my hart at rest. And in a dreame bewray what fate shall be my friend: Whether my life shall still decay or when my sorrow end. N. Breton. Astrophell his Song of Phillida and Coridon. Faire in a morne, (ô fairest morne) was neuer morne so faire: There shone a Sunne, though not the Sunne, that shineth in the ayre. For of the earth, and from the earth, (was neuer such a creature:) Did come this face, (was neuer face,) that carried such a feature. Vpon a hill, (ô blessed hill, was neuer hill so blessèd) There stoode a man, (was neuer man for woman so distressèd) This man beheld a heauenly view, which did such vertue giue: As cleares the blind, and helps the lame, and makes the dead man liue. This man had hap, (ô happy man more happy none then hee;) For he had hap to see the hap, that none had hap to see. This silly Swaine, (and silly Swaines are men of meanest grace:) Had yet the grace, (ô gracious guest) to hap on such a face. He pitty cryed, and pitty came, and pittied so his paine: As dying, would not let him die, but gaue him life againe. For ioy whereof he made such mirth, as all the woods did ring: And Pan with all his Swaines came foorth, to heare the Sheepheard sing. But such a Song sung neuer was, nor shall be sung againe: Of Phillida the Sheepheards Queene, and Coridon the Swaine. Faire Phillis is the Sheepheards Queene, (was neuer such a Queene as she,) And Coridon her onely Swaine, (was neuer such a Swaine as he) Faire Phillis hath the fairest face, that euer eye did yet behold: And Coridon the constants faith, that euer yet kept flocke in fold. Sweete Phillis is the sweetest sweete, that euer yet the earth did yeeld: And Coridon the kindest Swaine, that euer yet kept Lambs in field. Sweete Philomell is Phillis bird, though Coridon be he that caught her: And Coridon dooth heare her sing, though Phillida be she that taught her. Poore Coridon dooth keepe the fields, though Phillida be she that owes them: And Phillida dooth walke the Meades, though Coridon be he that mowes them. The little Lambs are Phillis loue, though Coridon is he that feedes them: The Gardens faire are Phillis ground, though Coridon be he that weedes them. Since then that Phillis onely is, the onely Sheepheards onely Queene: And Coridon the onely Swaine, that onely hath her Sheepheard beene. Though Phillis keepe her bower of state, shall Coridon consume away: No Sheepheard no, worke out the weeke, and Sunday shall be holy-day. N. Breton. Coridons supplication to Phillis. Sweete Phillis, if a silly Swaine, may sue to thee for grace: See not thy louing Sheepheard slaine, with looking on thy face. But thinke what power thou hast got, vpon my Flock and mee: Thou seest they now regard me not, but all doo follow thee. And if I haue so farre presum'd, with prying in thine eyes: Yet let not comfort be consum'd, that in thy pitty lyes. But as thou art that Phillis faire, that Fortune fauour giues: So let not Loue dye in despaire, that in thy fauour liues. The Deere doo brouse vpon the bryer, the birds doo pick the cherries: And will not Beauty graunt Desire, one handfull of her berries? If it be so that thou hast sworne, that none shall looke on thee: Yet let me know thou dost not scorne, to cast a look on mee. But if thy beauty make thee proude, thinke then what is ordain'd: The heauens haue neuer yet alow'd, that Loue should be disdain'd. Then least the Fates that fauour loue, should curse thee for vnkind: Let me report for thy behooue, the honour of thy mind. Let Coridon with full consent, set downe what he hath seene: That Phillida with Loues content, is sworne the Sheepheards Queene. N. Breton. A Sheepheards dreame. A Silly Sheepheard lately sate among a flock of Sheepe: Where musing long on this and that, at last he fell asleepe. And in the slumber as he lay, he gaue a pitteous groane: He thought his sheepe were runne away, and he was left alone. He whoopt, he whistled, and he call'd, but not a sheepe came neere him: Which made the Sheepheard sore appall'd, to see that none would heare him. But as the Swaine amazèd stood, in this most solemne vaine: Came Phillida foorth of the wood, and stoode before the Swaine. Whom when the Sheepheard did behold, he straite began to weepe: And at the hart he grew a-cold, to thinke vpon his sheepe. For well he knew, where came the Queene, the Sheepheard durst not stay: And where that he durst not be seene, the sheepe must needes away. To aske her if she saw his flock, might happen pacience mooue: And haue an aunswere with a mock, that such demaunders prooue. Yet for because he saw her come alone out of the wood: He thought he would not stand as dombe, when speach might doo him good. And therefore falling on his knees, to aske but for his sheepe: He did awake, and so did leese the honour of his sleepe. N. Breton. A Report Song in a dreame, betweene a Sheepheard and his Nimph. Shall we goe daunce the hay? The hay? Neuer pipe could euer play better Sheepheards Roundelay. Shall we goe sing the Song? The Song? Neuer Loue did euer wrong: faire Maides hold hands all a-long. Shall we goe learne to woo? To woo? Neuer thought came euer too, better deede could better doo. Shall we goe learne to kisse? To kisse? Neuer hart could euer misse comfort, where true meaning is. Thus at base they run. They run, When the sport was scarse begun: but I wakt, and all was doo. N. Breton. Another of the Same. Say that I should say, I loue ye? would you say, tis but a saying? But if Loue in prayers mooue ye? will you not be moou'd with praying? Think I think that Loue should know ye? will you thinke, tis but a thinking? But if Loue the thought doo show ye, will ye loose your eyes with winking? Write that I doo write you blessèd, will you write, tis but a writing? But if truth and Loue confesse it: will ye doubt the true enditing? No, I say, and thinke, and write it, write, and thinke, and say your pleasure: Loue, and truth, and I endite it, you are blessèd out of measure. N. Breton. Daffodils and Primroses. Part 2d: POEMS from Hitherto Unprinted MSS. IN THE POSSESSION OF F. W. COSENS, Esq., London; and From the Tanner MSS., Bodleian, Oxford, etc. 1. [Elizabeth Regina.] When nature fell to studie firste to frame a daintie peece That might put downe those painted toyes Appelles wrought in Greece; When heavnelie powres were happlie mett, and did in counsell stande To finishe vp a peece of wurke that Phisis had in hande; The Sunne withhelde his wonnted course, the planettes made a staie, The clowdes were gone, the windes were downe, time durst not steale away: The Muses tunde their instrumentes, the Nightingale her throate, The litle windes amidde the leaves did yeelde a heavnelie note, The lambes and Rabbottes ranne at base, the fishes fell to playe, Bothe Sainctes and men, beastes, fishe, and fowle, did ioye to see y? daye; The dewes did giue so sweete an aire, the Sunne did shine so bright That reason sawe that nature wrought the highest heavnes delight. E The earthe whereon she shewde her art, was vertues (E) Excellence, L The laboure that she layde thereon, was (L) loue with diligence, I The compas of her heade conceite, was (I) Judgment of the wise, Z Her harte she made of heavnely (Z) zeale, that hath no hollowe eyes: A (A) Authoritie she made the marke, to shewe a Princesse face B And (B) Beawtie was the heavnelie hue that gave the favor grace; E (E) Entire good will that sawe this wurke whereon highe fancies fedd, T Brought naked (T) Truthe to make the werke vnto this happie hedd. H Her armes were bothe of (H) Honnors wrought, her handes were Natures Arte, Whose fingers like the Spinners threddes will holde the strongest harte. RE By (R) reason and (E) Endeuor then did nature drawe a breste G That shewde an Angell for her shape, a (G) Goddesse for the rest. I Her lower limmes were (I) Justice staies, that shuld dishonor hate, N Her feete were (N) notes of vertues steppes, that doe vpholde her state. A When these were (A) all in order plast, and finely putt togither, The Aungells, and the heavnelie powres on heapes ran pressing thither; And nature when she veiwde her wurke, did stande as in amaze, The Sunne, the moone, and all the starres stood euerie one at gaze; But as they stood was harde a voyce from out the loftie skie, Bad haste awaie, for higher powres were cu?ing by and by; For happie fame throughe heavne and earth had it so far co?ended That Jove himselfe badd nature leave, itt colde not be amended. And therewithall the Sunne and moone shone both at once so faire, The starres did shoote, and made alofte such fier wurkes in the Aire, The lightninges flashèd to and fro, throughe heavens was such a thunder As if the gods came downe from heaven to see this Earthely wunder; But thunder ceast, I harde a sounde singe Sola sancta cara, The name of Natures finest wurke is Excellenza rara. Who further seekes in plainer sence this blessèd Aungell's name The substance wheron nature wrought will easelie shewe the same. Thus with a sweete consort at length awaie the Muses goe And lefte the wurke, before my face that did awake me so. 2. [In Sadness.] The pretie Turtle dove that with no litle moane When she hathe loste her loving make, sitts moorninge all alone; The swanne that alwaies singes an howre before her deathe, Whose deadlie gryves doe giue the groues that drawe awaie [her] breathe; The Pellican that pecks the blud out of her brest And by her deathe doth onlie feede her younge ones in the nest; The harte emparkèd cloase within a plotte of grounde, Who dare not ouerlooke the pale for feare of hunters hounde; The hounde in kennell tyed that heares the chase goe by, And bootles wishing foote abroade, in vaine doth howle and crye; The tree with witherde topp, that hathe his braunches deade, And hangeth downe his highest bowes, while other houlde vpp heade; Endure not half the deathe, the sorrowe nor disgrace That my poore wretched minde abids, where none can waile my case. For truth hath loste his trust, more dere then turtle doue, And what a death to suche a life, that suche a paine dothe proue; The Swan for sorrow singes, to see her deathe so nye, I die because I see my deathe, and yet I can not dye. The Pellican doth feede her younge ones with her bludd, I blede to death to feede desires y? doe me neuer good; My hart emparkèd rounde, within the grounde of greif, Is so besett with howndes of hate, y? lookes for no releif; And swete desire my dogg is cloggèd so with care, He cries and dies to here delightes and come not wher they are; My tree of true delight is sokde with sorrow soe, As but the heavnes do sooner helpe, wilbe his ouerthrowe; In summe, my dole, my deathe, and my disgrace is suche As neuer man that euer lyvde knewe euer halfe so muche. 3. [Love Rejected.] Goe muse vnto the bower, whereas the mistress dwelles, And tell her of her servaunte's loue, but tell her nothing ells; And speake but in her eare, that none maie heare but she, That if she not the sooner helpe, there is no helpe for me. Not that I feare to speake, but it is straunge to heare That she will neuer looke on him, that howldes her loue so deere. Perhaps she knows it not, or if she doe, she will not, Yet let her kindnes haue a care that thoughe she hurte she kill not; And thoughe it be so straunge, yet let her this beleue me That dead men lyve, yet I am dead yet liue, if she releue me. For yet are not so coulde the coles of kinde desire, But in the ashes liues a sparke to kindle love a fyer; W?? fier his fuell hathe but from those fairest eies, Where faithe doth burne and fauncie flame, and fauor neuer dyes. 4. [My Lady-Love.] Neuer thinke vpon anoye, Where the harte hath suche a Joye. But head leave akinge, Harte is in better takinge; Eies leave your weepinge, Loue hath sweete thoughtes in kepinge; Harte howlde thine owne yitt, Loue is not ouerthrowne yitt, And the heavnes them selues haue sworne, Loue shall neuer be forlorne. See howe she chaunceth, That all true loue advaunceth; Sweete be that smile yitt, That bydes me liue a-while yitt; Euer be lyvinge Those eyes suche comfort givinge; That when loue was almost slaine, Made him whole at harte againe. Oh heavnelie feature, Was neuer suche a creature Riche in best treasure; Beawties pride, honors pleasure, Faire with suche graces As putteth downe all faces: Oh she is the heavnelie[st] Quene That the worlde hathe euer seene. Quene of suche powre As sweeteth euery sowre; Heavnelie perfeccon, All perfect loves dyrection; Loue of that offence That showes the only presence Of those blessèd angells eyes, Where loue lives and neuer dyes. 5. [Breton's Resolution.] If beawtie did not blinde the eies, it were a blessèd thinge to see, But when it spoiles the eye sight so, it is no looking glasse for me. If riches did not fall to rust, then woulde I loue the gowlden heape, But since that drosse dothe fall to duste I will not sowe &amp; other reape. If wisdome did not maze the wittes and all the sence of reason passe, I wolde be wise, but hate the witt to make a wise man proue an asse. If grammer were not oute of grace, then wolde I gladlie goe to schoole, But when that learning hathe no lucke I see the wise is but a foole. Yf honor were not cause of pride, then woulde I wishe authoritie, But since that pride is in such hate, I make no haste to dignitie. If loue were not the deathe of life, then wolde I learne the life to love, But since I finde the passion suche, I doe not care the paine to proue. But since that beawtie, loue, welth, witt, bothe learning and the loftie powre, And euery thought of euery sweete dothe carrie suche a secrett sowre; I will resolue on this conceite, to sett my hart on none of these, But on that heavnlie loue of His that harde misfortune cannot leese; Whose face is fayrer then the sunne, whose brightest beawtie euer shineth, And cleeres the eies, and cheeres the harte, that to His holy will enclineth. Whose loue is suche a Joye of life, as lets the louer neuer dye, Who dyed for loue, and liues with loue, wher loue doth liue eternallie; Whose welth is such a worlde of ioyes, as neuer worlde can comprehende, And doth in comfort still encrease when all the world shall have an ende. Whose wisdome in the waie of truthe, doth so vnite the wites together, As leades them to the havne of rest, that ranging were they know not whether. Whose learning is the law of love, whose love is all the lawe of life, Wher patience dothe by prayre find the happie end of euerie strife; Whose powre is as farre from pride, as heavnlie from hellishe hate, Who scorneth none but loueth all, as well the lowe as highe of state. This is the Beawtie, loue, welthe, witt, the learninge and the living powr That shewes the sowle the secrett sweete that neuer tasteth of the sowre; And blessèd be that beawtie sweete, that is no swete vnto the sight, But in the harte of highest love is founde the lampe of heavnlie light, And ten times honor to that love, wher faithfull hope dothe euer liue From whence the sowle receiues the sweete y? mercie doth repentaunce giue; And euer liue that lovely store, that shewes the treasure of the minde, Wher humble faithe doth winne the welthe that worldlie fortune cannot find, And worship to that wisdome greate, that is the grace of highest witt And shewes the humble sowle the sweete, where mercie doth in glorie sitt. And glory to that heavnly grace, that giues the rule of perfect loue, Which findes the onlie sweete of sweetes that neuer anie sorrow proue, And praise vnto that highest powre, wher mercie is y? marke of grace That he that hath no rest on earth in heavne shall haue a dwelling place. This beawtie, loue, this welth, this witt, this learning and this living powre, This summe of sweete which doth admitt no summe at all of anie sowre, The wisdome how to knowe all these and powre to vse them to the best. In these desires to liue and die doth Bretons resolucon rest. 6. [Faith Disdained.] When fate decreeth, Fortune agreeth And fancie seeth. But faithes distres Of hart all hopeles, And hope all hapeles, The sorrow endles Can none expresse. When faithe vnfainèd Shalbe disdainèd, And fauor gainèd, By fancyes treason, The bitter pacience That bids the absence Of wishèd presence, Is paste all reason. And he that lyeth And euer cryeth, And neuer spyeth How hope maie liue; Must be contented To be tormented, Till harte relented May fauor gyue. Till when and euer Revolting neuer, I will perseuer Where firste I stood. Where faithe hath seruèd To haue deseruèd, The swete preseru?d To doe me good. Finis. 7. [The Rose the Queene.] The feildes are grene, the springe growes on a-pace, And nature's arte beginns to take the ayre; Each herb her sent, ech flowre doth shewe her grace, And beawtie braggeth of her bravest fayre. The lambes and Rabbottes sweetely runne at base, The fowles do plume, and fishes fall to playe; The muses all haue chose a settinge-place To singe and play the sheppherdes rundeley. Poore Choridon the onlie sillye swaine, That only liues and doth but onlie liue; Ys now become, to finde the heavnely vaine, Where happie hope dothe highest comfort gyve. The little wren that neuer sunge a note Is peepinge nowe to proue how she can singe; The nightingale hath sett in tune her throte, And all the woodes with little Robins ringe. Loue is abroade as naked as my nayle, And litle byrdes doe flycker from their nestes; Diana sweete hath sett aside her vaile, And Phillis shewes the beawtie of her brestes. Oh blessèd brestes, the beawtie of the Springe! Oh blessèd Springe that suche a beawtie showes! Of highest trees the hollye is the Kinge, And of all flowres faire fall the Quene the Rose. 8. [Let Love kill me.] Oh eies, leave of your weepinge, Loue hath the thoughtes in keepinge, That maie content yee; Let not this misconceivinge Where comfortes are receyving, Causles torment yee. Clowdes threaten but a showre, Hope hath his happie howre Thoughe longe in lastinge: Time nedes must be attended, Loue must not be offended With to muche hastinge. Yitt oh the painefull pleasure, Wher loue attendes the leizure Of loves wretchednes; Where hope is but illusion, And feare but a confusion Of loues happines. Yitt happie hope that seeth Howe loue and life agreeth, Of life depriue me; Or let me be assurèd, When life hath death endurèd Loue will revive me. But if I be that louer That neuer shall recouer But spight shall spill me, Then let thus much suffize me, That heavnes this death deuise me, That loue shulde kill me. Finis. 9. [Mine only Princesse.] Faire, fairer then the fairest! Oh hart how thow dispairest! Yitt beawtie is not pitiles And therefore be not comfortles. Oh eies that starres resemble! Oh sences, howe ye tremble! Yitt neuer feare your blindnes, They are but lightes of kindnes. Oh face of heavnely feature! Oh dye not wretched creature! The comfort neuer dyeth That in her favor lyeth. Oh gracious heavnely goddesse! Evne of thy heavnely goodnesse Cast one good looke vppon me, That am thus wo bego? me. That I may saie and vowe itt, And reason may allow itt; If anie helpe the helpeles It is mine only Princesse. Finis. 10. Choridon's Dreame. Fast by a fountaine sweete and clere Within a quechy springe; Mine eyes did see, myne eares did heare, A heavnely aungell singe. Her face to faire was to beholde, Yet had I oft a glaunce; But when I sought to be so boulde I fell into a traunce. For as vpon the siluer streames Hath Phœbus fairest grace; Euen so beholde the sunny beames That sitt vpon her face. And for her voyce, it was no sounde That humaine creatures make; For where the eccho did rebounde Itt makes the earth to shake. And when she gan for to divide The musicke of her thoughte; Then Philomelas note was tride To be a thinge of noughte. Now when I harde the songe so sweete, I drewe me somewhat nere her; And close on handes and feete did creepe, To sitt where I might heare her. And secretlie awhile vnseene Harde by this heavnely springe I satt, whereas I sawe this Queene, And harde this Angell singe. Ah Phillida, poore Phill, quothe shee This mourning is but vaine; Thy ioy is so farre gon fro thee It cannot come againe. Thy Shepperd dead, thy flocke do feede Vpon the barren hills: And thy best herb is but a reede That all thy garden spilles. Thy daintie springe is dryed awaye That dyd thy garden nourishe; And when thy flowres did all decaye, How can thy garden flourishe. No Phillis, now farewell to love Thy life is dead and gon; And all the hope of thy behofe, Is heavne to thinke vpon. Base is the riche, blinde are the wise, Vnfortunate the fayre; And honor in discomfort dyes When loue is in dispaire. But to despight dispaire, quothe shee, Death shalbe yet a frende; When with a shrike she wakèd me, And so my dreame did end. Finis. 11. S? Ph. Sydney's Epitaph. Deepe lamenting losse of treasure, Showed tormentinge without measure; Wisdome waylinge, honor cryinge, Vertue weeping and loue dyinge; All together doe betoken Greater greife then can be spoken. Losse of wealth may be recouered, Deadlie perill soone discouered; Mortall woundes may be endurèd, And the deepest may be curèd; But my hope of helpe is none For both loue, and life, is gone. When I lyvèd, then I lovèd, But my loue from life remouèd; And dispaire discomfort givinge, What is this but dyinge lyving? Dying deathe a sorrow suche, Neuer creature knewe so muche. Reasons sence and learninges sweetinge Where the muses had theire meetinge Nature's grace and honors glory, Of the worlde the wofull storye; That with bitter teares be redd Sweete S? Phillipp Sydney dead. Dead? oh no, in heavne he liueth Whom the heavnes suche honor giueth; That thoughe heere his bodie lye Yitt his sowle shall neuer dye; But as fame can perish neuer, So his faith shall liue for euer. Finis. 12. [Love Dead.] Sitting late with sorrow sleepinge, Where harte bledd and eies were weepinge; I might see from heavnes descendinge, Beawtie mourninge for loves endinge; When with handes most wofull wringinge, She entombes him with this singinge. Muses now leave of enditinge, Poettes all giue ouer writinge; Nymphes come teare your tender heares, Shepperdes all come shedde your teares; Cupid now is but a warlinge, Death hath wounded honors darling. Curste death, and all to cruell, Hast thow stolne mine only Jewell? Doe the heavnelie fates so spight me As on earth shall nought delight me? But of suche a Joye bereave me, As no loue of life shall leave me! Goe then flocke, leave of your feedinge, All your life lyes now a-bledinge; When my Shepperde did attend yow, Wolf nor Tygre colde offend yow; But nowe he is dead and gone, I shall loose yow euerie one. Sorrowes all come shewe your powres, Earthe giue ouer bringing flowres; Neuer trees nowe beare more fruite, Lett all singinge birdes be mute; And of loue no more be spoken, For the harte of loue is broken. Therewithall as in a Clowde She did all her shining shrowde; When sweete Phillis gaue suche groanes As did pearce the very stones, That the Earth with sorrowe shakèd And poore Choridon awakèd. Finis. 13. [Faithful unto death.] Wytt whether will you? Eyes what dothe ayle yee? Harte what doth kill yowe? Sences why fayle yee? Where haste thowe bene man With thy sweete Phillis? What hast thow seene man? Nothinge that yll is. Loue will befreinde thee If thow attend him; And he will ende thee If thowe offende him. Riche is the treasure That the harte loveth; Loue is the pleasure That the harte proueth. Beawtie enchaunteth But the eies fauncy, But when hart panteth Ware of a frenzey. Yf she but eye thee Comfort may rest gitt Yf she denye thee Hope of the best yitt. Thoughe she disdaine thee Doe not giue ouer, Thoughe she hath slayne thee Dye yitt her louer. Finis. 14. [Transitoriness.] Tyme is but shorte, and shorte the course of tyme, Pleasures doe pas but as a puffe of wynde, Care hath accompte to make for euery cryme, And peace abids but with the settled minde. Of litle paine doth pacience great proceede, And after sickenes helthe is daintie sweete; A frende is best approuèd at a neede, And sweete the thought where care and kindnes meete. Then thinke what comfort dothe of kyndnes breede, To knowe thy sycknes sorrowe to thy frende; And lett thy faithe vpon this favoure feede, That loue shall liue when death shall haue an ende. And he that liues assurèd of thie loue, Prayes for thy life, thy health and highest happe; And hopes to see the hight of thy behove, And in the sweete of loues deare lappe. Tyll when, take paines to make thie pillow softe, And take a nap for natures better reste; Hee lyves belowe, that yitt dothe look alofte, And of a freinde doth not affecte the leste. Finis. 15. [The Nightingale and Phillis.] Vpon a deintie hill sumtime, Did feede a flocke of sheepe; Where Coridon woulde learne to clyme, His litle lambes to keepe. Wher Roses, with the viollettes sweete, Did growe amonge the bryres; Where muses and the nymphes did meete, To talke of loue's desires. There Choridon when corne was ripe For his sweete Phillis' sake, Wolde playe vpon his countrey pipe And all his musicke make. Now when he had but sounded owte “The begger and the kinge”; The birdes wold all be flockt aboute, To helpe the Shepperde singe. And euerie one began to frame To sett in tune her throate; Till daintie Philomela came Who kild them with a note. For she sweete mowse, had such a vaine Within a hawthorne bushe; As made the sellie Shepperde swayne Himselfe to be at hushe. But as thus Philomela satt Recordinge of a grownde; And all the rest did murmere att The sweetnes of her sownde; Came Phillis sweete owte of the wood And in her hand a lute; Who when she playde but Robin Hoode Strooke Philomela mute. And when she but began to singe Of shepperdes and their sheepe; She made the litle woodes so ringe They wakte me from my sleepe. Finis. 16. [Heart-Pain.] At my harte there is a paine, Neuer paine so pincht my hart; More then halfe with sorrowe slaine And the paine will yitt not part. Oh my harte how it dothe bleede Into droppes of bitter teares! While my faithfull loue dothe feede But on fancyes only feares. Ah poore loue why dost thow liue? Thus to see thie service loste; If she will no comforte giue Make an end, giue vp the ghoste. That she may at last approue That shee hardly long beleued; That the hart will die for love That is not in time releived. Oh that euer I was borne Service so to be refusèd; Faithfull loue to be forlorne Neuer loue was so abusèd. But sweete loue, be still a while She that hurte the soone may heale the; Sweete I see within her smile More then reason can reveale thee. For thoughe shee bee riche and faire Yitt is she both wise and kinde; And therfore doe not dispaire But thy faithe may favor finde. And althoughe shee be a Queene That maie suche a make despise; Yitt with silence all vnseene Run, and hide thee in her eyes. Wher if she will lett the dye Yitt at latest gaspe of breathe Say that in a ladyes eye Loue both tooke his lif and deathe. Finis. 17. [Olden Love-making.] In time of yor when Shepperds dwelt Vpon the mountaine rockes; And simple people neuer felte The paine of louers mockes; But litle birdes wowld cary tales Twixte Susen and her Sweetinge; And all the dainty Nightingals Dyd singe at louers meetinge. Then might you see what lookes did pas Where shepperds dyd assemble; And wher the life of true loue was, When hartes could not dissemble. Then yea and nay was thought an oathe That was not to be dowted; And when it came to faith &amp; troathe We were not to be flowted. Then did they talke of Curds &amp; creame, Of butter cheese and milke: There was no speach of sonny beame, Nor of the golden silke. Then for a guifte a rowe of pinnes, A purse, a paire of Knyves; Was all the waie that love begins, And so the shepperd wyves. But now we haue so muche adoe And are so sore agreuèd; That when we goe aboute to woe We cannot be beleuèd. Such choise of Jewells, ringes &amp; chaines That maie but fauo? move; And suche Intollerable paines Ere one can hitt on love. That if I still shall bide this life Twixt loue and deadly hate; I wyll goe learne the countrey life or leave the louers state. Finis. 18. Quatuor elementa. The Aire with swete my sences doe delight, The earthe with flowres, doth gladd my heavie eye, The fier with warmth revives my dying spritt, The water cooles that is too hott and drye: The aire, the earthe, the water, and the fyre, All doe me good; what can I more desire? Oh no, the Aire infected sore I finde, The earthe her flowres do wither and decaye, The ffire so hott, it dothe enflame the minde, And water wasteth white, and all awaie: The aire, the earth, fier, water, all anoie me: How can it be but they must nedes destroye me. Sweete Aire, do yett awhile thy swetnes holde, Earth, lett thy flowres not fall awaie in prime, Fire, doe not burne, my hart is not a colde, Water, drye vpp vntill another tyme; Or Aire, or earthe, fier, water heer my prayer, Or plaine me one, fier, water, earthe, or Aire. Hark, in the Aire, what deadly thund'rs threateth, See, on the earth how euery flower falleth, Oh with the fier, how euerie sinow sweateth, Ah, how the water, panting hart appalleth: The aire, the earth, fier, water, all to greiue me, Heavnes shewe yo? powres, yitt sume way to releiue me. This is not Aire that euery creature feedeth, Nor this the earth, wher euery flower groweth, Nor this the fire that cole and baven breedeth, Nor this the water, that both eb?? and flowthe: These elementes are in a world enclosèd, Wher happie hart hath heavnly rest exposèd. 19. A Sonett vpon this worde in truth spoken by a Lady to her Servaunte. In truth is trust, distrust not then my truthe, Let vertue liue, I aske no greater love; Of suche regarde, repentance not ensuthe, And hope of heavne doth highest hono? p've. In truthe, sume time it was a sweete conceite To see how loue and life dyd dwell togeth??; But now in truthe there is so muche deceite That truth in deede is gone I know not whether. Yitt liueth truthe and hath her secrett loue, And loue in truthe deserves to be regarded; And loves regard in reason doth approue, Approuèd Truth can neu?? be discarded. Then trie me first, and if that true yow p've me, In truth you wronge me, if you do not love me. 20. Againe vpon the same subiect. Truthe shewes her selfe is secrett of her truste, Wisdome her grace in hono? of her love; Vertue her life, wher loue is not vniust, Loue in his sweetes that dothe no sorrow p've. Truth hath in hate to heere a fainèd tale, Wisdome doth frowne, when ffollie is in place; Honor is gon, where beawtie is to sale, And vertue dies where loue is in disgrace. I leave yo? truthe to yo? desirèd truste, Yo? wisdome to the wounder of the wise; Yo? highest ioye to iudgment of the iust, Wher vertue lives, and honor neuer dyes; And hee vouchsafes yow that all truth p'serueth What truth of loue, and loue of truthe deserueth Finis. 21. [Despondency.] Ah poore conceite, pull downe delight, thy pleasant daies are done, The shadie vales muste be there walkes, that cannot see the sunne; The world I not to witnes call, the heavnes my recordes be, If euer I was false to loue, or louer true to me. I knowe it now, I knowe it not, but all to late I rue it, I rue not that I knowe it now, but that I euer knewe it. My care is not a fonde conceite, that bredes a fainèd smarte, My greives doe gripe me at the gall, and gnawe me at the heart; My teares are not thos fainèd dropps, that fall from fancies eies, But bitter streames of strange distres, wherin discomfort lyes. My sighes are not those heavie haps, that shewe a sicklie breath, My passions are the p'fect signes, and verie panges of death. In some, to make a dolfull eye, I see my deathe so nye, That sorrow bids me singe my last, and so my sences dye. Finis. 22. [Melancholia.] Some men will saie, there is a kinde of muse, That helps the minde of each man to endite; And some will saie (that many muses vse) There are but nyne, that eu?? vsde to wryte. Nowe of thes nyne, if I haue gotten one, I muse what Muse it is, I hitt vpon. Some poetes write, there is a certaine hill, Wher Pallas keepes, and that parnassus hight; There muses sitt forsooth, and cutt the quill That being framde, doth hidden fancyes write; But all those dames do heavnly causes singe, And all their pennes, are of a Phœnix winge. But as for me, I neuer sawe the place, Except in sleepe I dreamd of suche a thinge; I neuer veiwde dame Pallas in the face, Nor eu?? yet cold here her muses singe, Wherby to frame a fauncy in such kinde; Oh no my muse is of another mynde. Ffrom hellicon, no, no, from hell she came, To write of woes, and miseries she hight; Not Pallas but (alas) her ladies name, Who neuer calls for ditties of delight; Her pen is paine, and all her matter moane, And paunting hartes, she paintes her mynde vpon. A harte (not harpe) is all her instrument, Whose weakned stringes all out of tune she stranes; And then she strikes a dumpe of discontent, Till euery stringe be pluckt a too with pains; Loe then in rage, she claps it vp in case, That none maie see her instrumentes disgrace. Her musinge is (in sume) but sorrows songe, Where discordes yeld a sounde of smale delight; The dittie this, of life that lastes to longe, To see desire so crossèd with despight; No faithe on earth, alas I knowe no frend, So with a sighe she makes a solenme end. Who can delight in suche a wofull sounde, Or loues to here a lay of deepe lament? What note is sweete, when greif is all the grounde? Discordes can yeld but only discontent: The wrest is wronge, that strayns eche stringe to farre, And stryfes the stoppes that giue eche stroake a Jarre. Harshe is alas, the harmony, god knowes, When owte of Tune is almost euery stringe; The sounde not sweete that all of sorrowe growes, And sad the muse that so is forst to singe; But some do singe, that but for shame wold cry?, So dothe my muse, and so sweare do I. Good nature weeps to see her selfe abusèd, Yll fortune shewes her fury in her face; Poore reasone pynes to see him selfe refusde, And dutie dyes to see his sore disgrace; Hope hanges the head, to see dispaire so neere, And what but deathe can end this heavie cheere Behold each teare, no token of a toye, But torment suche as teare my hart asunder; Each sobbing sighe, a signe of suche anoye As how I liue, beleue me till a wunder; Each groane a grype, that makes me gaspe for breath, And euery strain a bitter pange of deathe. Loe thus I liue, but looking still to dye, And still I looke, but still I see in vayne; And still in vaine, alas, I lye and crye And still I cry but haue no ease of paine; So still in paine I liue, looke, lie, and crye When hope will helpe, or death will let me dye. Finis. 23. [Aspiration.] Oh that desire colde leave to liue, that longe hath lookt to die, Or sadd conceite might hope to see an end of miserye! Or that the death of my desire wold thinke of my distres, Or ells sume happie powre of heavne, wold send my soule redres; But oh I crye, and so I lye, with sorrow torne a sunder, That how I liue, the lord doth know, it is no litle wunder; For had all pacience but the powre one passion to appease, Or cold this feeble fainting harte, but find sume litle ease, Or cold the smalest peece of thought, amidd my greatest greif, But tell me once but of a hope, how hart might have releif; Then might I liue, now must I die, or suche a deathe endure As is the corzy of the care that neuer can haue cure. But yow that rede this ruifull verse, consider of his care, Who only knowes the cruell woes, wher comfortes neuer are; And yow that see thes trickling teares, distilling downe thes eyes Imagine of the dying life, that living euer dyes; And yow that here thes sobbing sighes that from this hart ascend, Diuine vpon the pangs of death, wher passions neuer end; But if no reason can conceiue the ruine of my thought, Nor deepest wisdome will discerne what hath my sorrow wrought, Nor pittie can p'cure a meane to mittigate my paine, But sorrow still must soke the hart, and venime euery vaine, If nether hope, nor happe, nor heavne, nor fortune, fate, nor friend, Will once releive, release, cutt of, nor cause one sorrow end: What then can rest for me, poore wretch, but thus to lye and crye, In heavene, in heavne must be my life, for in the world I dye. Finis. 24. [Dead Hopes.] Yf heavne and earthe were bothe not fullie bente To plauge a wretch with an Infernall payne; To robbe the harte of all his hie contente And leave a wounde that sholde not heale againe. Yf cruell fortune did not seeke to kill The carfull spiritt of my kinde affecte; And care did not so crucifie me still That loue had lefte no hope of his effecte. Yf she whom most my hart hath ouerlovde Were not vnkind in care of my distres; And she by whom my greif might be removde Did not hold backe the meane of my redres; If all these thoughtes and manie thousande moe To longe to tell, to deadlie to endure; Did not consume my hart in sorrowe soe, That care hath lefte no hope of any cure; Then might I yet amidd my greatest greif Perswade my pacience with some heavnly powre, That when I most despaire of my releif My hopeles harte might find some happie howre; But since that Fortune so doth frowne vpon me That care hath thus of comfortes all berefte me; Thinke it not straunge to see me woe begone me, When no good hope of no good happ is left me; And since I see all kindnes so vnkinde, And freindship growne to suche contrary thought; And suche a thought the torment of the minde, That care and sorrow hath consumde to nought; I will resolue (thoughe pacience he p'force) To sitt me downe and thus in secrett crye; Dead is my harte, oh earth receiue my corse, Heavne be my lif for in the worlde I dye. Finis. 25. [Sweete Penelope.] When Authors wryte, god knowes what thinge is true; Old Homer wrot of fine Vlysses witt, And Ovid wrote of Venus heavnly hue, And Ariosto of Orlantos fitt, One wrote his pleasure of Caliope: I am to write of swete Penelope. And where ech one did shewe a secret vaine And whether that Vlysses were or not; And thoughe that Ovid did but only faine, And Ariosto sett downe manie a blott, And some wrote lewdly of Caliope: I write but truth of sweete Penelope. And if I had Vlysses skilfull skonce, With Homers penne, and Ovids heavnly vaine; I wold sett downe a wounder for the nonce, To sett them all a new to wurke againe; And he that wrote of his Caliope Shold hushe to heere of this Penelope. As true as shee that was Vlisses wif, As faire as she whom some a goddesse faine; A saincte of shape and of more vertuous life, Then she for whom Orlandos knight was slaine; In euerie thinge aboue Caliope, There is none suche as swete Penelope. And for this time goe looke the world that wyll For constant faire, for vertue and good grace; For euery parte in whom no parte is ill, For perfecte shape and for a heavnly face; Angelica, Venus, Caliope Are all but blowes vnto Penelope. 26. [Beauty.] All my sences stand amazèd, While mine eies to longe haue gazèd On a faire and heavnlie creature, Half an angell for her feature; Little Cupids onely darlinge, All to good for suche a warlinge: What although a god he bee, Loue is blind and cannot see. Blind! alas it is no wounder, Beawtie breakes the sight asunder; Neuer hart that once dyd eye her, But was fearfull to come nye her; Only Loue a heavnly powre, Thought to trie a happie howre; Lookt so longe and starde so sore, That at laste he sawe no more. But is beawtie so vnkind then With her shining beames to blind men? Are their eyesightes all depriuèd That haue Beawties eies arrivèd? If it be so, god preserve her, Loue himselfe is gladd to serue her! And lett simple men beware Howe they doe on beawtye stare. I of late but as it chauncèd Stoode but wheras beawtie glauncèd; As mine eies aside I turnèd, Oh with what a flame they burnèd! Lett not loue therfore be blamèd That with beawtie is enflamèd; Looke who list [and] loue who dare, Blinde that doe on beawtie stare. 27. [Love-Rapture.] All my witte hath will enwrappèd. All my sence desire entrappèd, All my faith to fancy fixèd, All my joye to loue annexèd, All my loue I offer thee. Once for all yett looke one me. Let me see that heavnely feature Oh heavnes, what a heavnelie creature! All the powres of heavne preserue thee, All the powres on earthe do serue thee, Princesse' will, [and] goddesse' place, Blessèd be that Angells face. Looke oh Angell, looke vpon me, See howe I am woe begone me! Of both witt and sence depriuèd, But of thee to be revivèd; Thow that art the shepperdes story In thy pittie shewe thy eye; I can saie no more but this In thie loue my livinge is. Finis. 28. [Love almost Slaine.] Will it neuer better be? Do the heavnelie fates agree There shall be no helpe for me? Nor these eyes shall euer see Fruite of my desirèd tree? No, thoughe fortune haue forsworne me And faire beawtie so do scorne me, That suche hatefull thoughtes are borne me As with cruell cares haue torne me; Yett hath loue not quite forlorne me. Love? how (lord) am I deceyuèd? Kindnes all amisse conceiuèd, Where no comfort is receiuèd But to plainlie is perceiuèd Will of witt and reason reavèd. But what doth this humor move? Reason hathe no rule of loue; Hee doth liue in heavne aboue, Where he wurkes for their behouve, That with sorrow pleasure proue. Pleasure all to full of paine, Swete yet be that heavnly vaine, Wherin doth that hope remaine, That when love was almost slaine Made him whole at harte againe, 29. [Phillis in Sorrow.] Pawse awhile my prittie muse, Let me rest for I am werie; All the musicke thou canst vse Cannot make thy master merry; For what hart can hold vp head When the joye of lif is dead? See how Phillis faire and bright, Beawties pride and Vertues pleasure; Halfe depriuèd of her light Sittes and sorrows out of measure; And when she is woe begon, Well a waie poore Choridon! Bid my Phillis once but cease Euer mourning, neuer endinge; Reason shall my greife release, Which ells, hopes of no amendinge; For while shee doth hange the head Coridon can be but dead. And therfore let this suffize: But in vaine thou doest devize. While thow seest my Phillis sadd How my comfort maie be hadd; For but in her ioye or greif Lives my death or my relief; In her sorrow is my hell, Bidd her laughe and I am well. Finis. 30. [Fascination.] Looke not to longe vpon thes lookes, that blindes the ouerlooker sore, And if you speake, speake not to muche, lest speaking once thou speak no more; Thinke not, but what it is to thinke, to reach beyond the reach of thought, And if yow doe do what you can when yow haue done yow can do nought; But if yow see against yo? will, looke but awaie and be not slaine, And if a word goe vnawares, with care it may be calde againe; And for a thought, it is no hurte, except it growe vnto a thinge But end that hath bene done, is onlie conquest for a kinge; But since in the, O sillie wretch, both sight, and speche, and thought, and deede, By reason of a wronge conceyte, do but thine owne confusion breede; Shutt vp thine eies, seale vp thie tongue, locke vp thy thoughtes, lay down thy head, And let thy mistres see by this how loue hath stroke her servant dead; And that but in her heavnlie eye, her word, her thought and only will Doth rest the deede to kill the quite or ells [to salve and] cure this ill. 31. [Of Sir Philip Sidney.] Perfeccon, peerles vertue without pride, Honor and learning linckt with highest loue; For of the thought is trewe discrecon tryde, Loue of the lif that highest honors prove; In Angells armes with heavnely hands imbraced, Paradise pleasde, and all the world disgraced. Seeke all the world, oh seeke and neuer find In earthly mowld the mownte of such a minde; Diuinest guiftes that god on man bestoweth, No glory suche as of suche glory groweth; End of the joyes that hath all greife begone Yitt lett me weepe when all the world hathe done. 32. [‘Perfection’ dead: Sidney.] Poure downe poore eyes the teares of true distres, Heare but oh heavnes, the horror of my crye; Iudge of the care that can haue no redres, Let mee not liue to see my louer dye; In Sorrowes rules, like sorrow neuer redd, Phillip, sweete knight, swete Philip Sydney dead. Paine more then Arte or Nature can oppres Hell to the world to loose a heavnly frende; Ioy is become but sorrow and distres, Lif with my loue, let death and dolor end; In bitter teares hath harte of honor bledd, Past hope of healpe, to see perfeccon dead. Finis. 33. [Choridon unhappy.] Choridon vnhappie swaine, Whether doste thou driue thy flocke? Litle foode is on the plaine, Full of daunger is the rocke; Wolfes and beares do kepe the woode Forrestes full of furres and brakes, Meadowes subiect to the fludds, Moores are full of myry lakes; Then if in nor wood nor hill Pasture nor yet meadow ground, To content a shepperde wyll, Can a feeding place be founde, What alas is to be sayde Suche a sellie flocke to cherrish? But the shepperde is dismayde To behold his cattle perishe; Yett my flocke before yow dye Tell my dainty shepperdesse In what case the man doth lye That she lefte so comfortles? And that in her only face Doth remaine that heavnly foode Which is all our hope of grace To dispatche or doe vs good: Wher, if you do find preserud All your gearing fresh and grene; Say that Phillis hath deservd To be cald the shepperdes queene. So adewe my sillie flocke This is all in charge I leaue yow, Kepe the path, and shune the rock Lest the Country do receiue yow. Finis. From the Tanner MSS., Bodleian, Oxford. 1.

      <field name="fulltext">AMORIS LACHRIMÆ AMORIS LACHRIMÆ: FOR THE DEATH OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY. Emonge the woes of those vnhappie wightes That haue sett downe the sorrowes of their time; Whos lyves are lefte devoide of all delightes And passe in greif the pleasure of their prime; Lett me discourse the secrett of my care More then conceite or sorrow can declare. Summe loose their welthe, it is a slender losse, My lif hath lost the treasure of my trust; Summe loose their helth, (alas) a common crosse, My life's delight is buried in the duste; Summe loose their frendes, it is not one man's woe, I lost a frende, such one there are no moe. Summe loose their loue, a sorrow nere the harte, In kinde affect the onlie crosse of crosses; Summe loose their lives, where sorowes neuer parte, Summe loose themselves in thinking of their losses; More then myself is such a frende berefte me As welth, nor health, nor loue, nor lif hath lefte me. And shall I tell what kinde of man hee was Whom thus I lovde, and neuer creature hated? Imagine firste it doth my reason passe To write of him whom highest powre created For euery parte that vertue had desired; Ioye of the heavnes and of the world admired. Yitt as my hart for grefe and sorrow can I will describe the substance of his state; In childishe yeeres he was estemde a man And halfe a man, more halfe a magistrate; And whom the Artes and Muses so attended As all in all by all he was commended. Whos wisdome was not spent in wanton toyes And thoughe no wanton, yett not voyd of witt; Of worldly jestes hee neuer made his joyes Although sumtime hee had a tast of itt; For lett the best that liues do what he can In summe thinges yitt he shewes he was a man. But if on earth there were a man divine For Nature's guiftes and Vertue's secrette grace; Then giue me leave to saie this love of mine Was heere to good to haue a dwellinge place; But liues in heavne in some hye angell's office Wher God Himself doth vse him in His service. To saie yitt more what in effect he was, Let this suffice in summe, he was a man Whose heavnly wisdome found the way to passe More then the powre of witt or reason can; In whose attemptes the world thus well dyd know him. Nothing but death cold euer ouerthrow him. Comely of shape, and of a manly face, Noble in birthe, and of a princelie mind; Kinde in affecte, and of a courtly grace, Curtecus to all, and carfull of the kind; Valure and vertue, learning, beauty, love, These were the partes that dyd his honor prove. Whos full perfeccon thus hath wisdome peisèd, His wordes were euer substance and his deedes divine; Reason the ground whereon his hope was raisèd, Labor his life, and learning was his lyne; Truth was his love, and tryall his intente, Care his conceite, and honor his contente. Hee spake no word but carede full his weight, Hee nothing did that euer tooke disgrace; Hee had no minde to muse vpon deceite, Hee builte in heavne, his only byding place; Hee loude the Churche, wher saintes do build the steple. And sought the world where angells are the people. Hee travaild farre, when hee was neerest home Where was no earthe, hee colde beholde a land; Hee sawe a house, without or lyme or lome, And saild the seas wher ther was neuer sande; Hee sounded depthes without or lyne or leade, And found out lif where other men were dead. Hee fearde no foe, nor euer sought a frende, Hee knew no want, and made no care of welthe; Hee nought begon but had a care to ende And neuer lovde the honor had in stelthe; By fyer and sworde he wonne his worthy fame, That hathe advauncde the honor of his name. In all the skye hee honourde but a starre, That was the course of all his kind affecon; Whos flame was neere althoughe the fyer afarre Gaue him the light of [his true] loue's direchon; Hee was so kinde and constant where he lovde, As once resolvde he colde not be removde. His hand was free to helpe the needie harte, His harte was francke to fill the empty hande; His most desire was to reward desarte, And hold vp state wher honor colde not stand; His onely joye was honor of the feilde, To conquer men and make the captaine yelde. Muche was his care and of his country moste, Litle his wantes and in himselfe the leaste; All for his freind did seme but litle cost Yitt to himselfe a litle was a feaste; Highe was their happ that might be but aboute him, Death is their life that morne to be without him. Now judge the life in leaving suche a joye The deathe, in losse of suche a dainty frende; What may remove the roote of his annoye Or how this greif may euer haue an ende? And if it be a care incurable, Thinke of the death where it is durable. To liue in death is but a dying life, To die in life is but a lyvinge deathe; Betwixte these two is suche a deadly strife As makes me drawe this melancholicke breath; Wherein conceite doth liue so discontented, As neuer harte was euer so tormented. A torment only made but by the mind, A minde ordeinde but only to distresse; And suche distres as can no comfort find But leaves the harte to dy remidyles; And suche a deathe as liueth to beholde Ten thowsande tormentes more then can be tolde. Yitt thoughe my pen can neuer halfe expresse The hideous tormentes of my heavy harte; Lett me set downe summe truthe of my distresse That some poore soule may helpe to beare a parte; That in extremes when wee are woe begon The world maie weepe to sitt and looke vpon. Nature and Arte are gott about his grave, And there sitt waylinge of eche other's losse; Hard by the tombe sitts Sorrow in her cave, Cutting her hart to think of honor's crosse; And Wisdome weepinge wringing of her handes To shew the world in what a case it standes. In this darke hold of death and heavines Sitts wofull Beawtie with her blubberd eyes; By her sitts Loue with care all comfortles, Recording of his mother's miseryes; Emonge the reste that waile the losse of freendes Sitts Pacience picking of her finger endes. From Pittie's face do fall the tricklinge teares Of tormentes suche as teare the hart of loue; The Muses sitt and rende their shrivled heares, To see the plume that loue and beawtie proue; Emonge them all howe I am torne asunder, And yitt do liue: confesse it is a wounder. I liue, I liue! alas, I liue in deede, But suche a life was neuer suche a deathe; While fainting hart is but constrainde to feede Vpon the care of a consuming breathe; Oh my sweete Muse, that knowst how I am vexed Paincte but one passion, how I am perplexed. I call for death but yitt she will not heere me, I reede my deathe, and rue my destinie; I see my death, but hee will not come nere me, I feele my deathe and yitt I cannot dye. But where noe death will kill nor grefe be cured, Thinke what a death of deathes I haue endured. Yitt while I lyve in all this misery, Lett me goe quarrell with this cruell fate; Wher death sholde do so great an iniury Vnto the staye of suche a happie state; At lyving thinges to make his levell soe, To kill a phœnix where there were no moe. Oh cruell Death, what lead thy hand awrye To take the best and leave the wurste behind? To youthe thou art vntimely destinie, Thou mightest haue bene a comfort to the blind; And ende the aged of their weary tyme, And not a youth in pride of all his prime. Thou moughtst haue shott at suche a wretched lought As had past ouer all his pleasant yeres; And kild the hart that is consumde to nought With being tangled in these worldly breres; But Beawtie's loue and Honor's harte to bleed Fie on the[e] Death, it is to[o] foule a deed. But well the world will curse the[e] to thy face, Beawtie and Loue will to thy teethe defie thee; Honor and Learninge drive thee in disgrace, Wher no good thought shall euer once come nigh thee; And soe my selfe to shewe that woe begon thee, Will praye to God all plagues maie light vpon ye. For I haue loste the honor of my love, My loue hath loste the honor of my life; My life and loue do suche a passion prove, As in the world was neuer such a strife; Where secrett death and sorrow are contented To [wail in] terror of a harte tormented. Thou camst to[o] soone, but now thou cumst to[o] late, Thy force to[o] great but now it is to[o] small; Halfe had in loue but wholy now in hate, Desirde of summe but cursed now of all; Oft I confes that I haue quaked before thee, But doe thy wurst Death now, I care not for thee. But dost thow thinke thou canst thy selfe excuse To sinn (alas) thou hast but done thy office; Vnhappie hande, whom so the heavnes do vse On suche a sainte to execute thy service; But since it was the will of God to doe itt, His will be done, I can but yeld vnto it. Yett for the care that Vertue hath conceiuèd For losse of him that was her deerest love; And for the death that Honor hath receiuèd Where pacience dothe the deadly passion prove; I can not chuse althoughe my hart wold hide itt, But shew my greif, so great I cannot hide it. Oh that I had but so divine a head As colde bewray the sorrows of my brest! Or from the grave to raise againe the dead And not offend my God in my request; Or by a prayre I might the grace obtaine To see the face of my desire againe. But all is vaine, my wishes not availe, My wordes are winde and cary no effecte; And with the greif I feele my sences faile, That fortune thus sholde crosse me in effecte, As by the losse of our sweete heavnely frend, My hart shold dye and yitt not dolor end. Ende? No God wott, there is no end of greif Where sad conceite will neuer out of minde; And booteles hope to harpe vpon releif Where care maie seeke but neuer comfort find; For in the world I had no joy but one, And all but death now see is dead and gone. Gone is my ioy, alas, and well awaye, What shall I doe now all my loue is gone? All my delight is falne into decaye, Onlie but heavne I haue to hope vpon: Oh heavnly powres take pitte of my crye, Lett me not liue and see my louer dy. Oh my loue! ah, my loue! all my loue gone Out alas sellie wretch, wel-a-day, woe is me! Of a freind euer freinde, suche a freind none In the world, throughe the world, may the world see; Holly saintes, higher powres, heavnes looke vpon me Pitty me, comfort me, thus woe begon me. My heavnly loue heavne lovde as well as I, Heavne was his care and heavne was his content; In heavne he liues, in heavne he cannot dye, From heavne he came and to the heavnes he wente; Oh heavnly loue, heavne will I looke for never, Till in the heavnes I maie behold the[e] euer. But what? methinkes I see a sodeine chaunge The worlde doth seme to alter Nature muche; The state of thinges is to my reason straunge And sorrowes such as ther was neuer suche: Suche lacke of loue, such mourninge for a frend Suche worlde of woes as if the world shuld end. Methinkes I see the Queene of kind affecte, Sighing and sobbing with such inward greif As hee that cold consider the effecte Might see a harte lye dead without releif; And in conceite so ouercome with care, As killes my harte to see her hevy fare. Methinkes I see a sight of armèd horse, Ledd in by boyes as if the men were dead; Methinkes I heere men murmur of a corse, And gallant youthes goe hanging of y? head; Methinkes I heere a thunder in the aire Bids farewell hope, and looke vpon despaire. Methinkes I herd the trumpett, drumm and fife, Sound all amort as if the worlde were done; Methinkes I see the end of happie life, Or second ioy since latter age begone; Methinkes I heere the horror of the cry As if the day were cumme y? all shold dye. Oh what I heer, oh what I feele and see, Hold, harke, helpe, heavnes, how can I longer liue? But in the heavnes there is no helpe for me, Not all the world can anie comfort giue; When death doth of my deerest loue depriue [me] What can remain in comfort to revive me? Yitt for the world shall witnes what thou art Which in the world didst leave no like behinde; I will sett downe though shorte of thy desarte The happy honor of thy heavnely minde; And on this tombe I will w?? teares engrave, The death of lif that for thy lacke I haue. Looke on the hills, how all the shepperdes sitt Heavie to thinke vpon their honest frend; How Phillis sitts, as one besides hir witt To see the sorrow of her shepperde's end; Harke how the lambes goe blayning vp and downe, To see their shepperde caried to the towne. Looke how the flocke begins to leave there feedinge! While cruell beastes breake in among the sheepe; See how the hart of loue doth lye a-bleeding, [That] Mars was slaine while Venus was a-sleep; See how the earth is bare in euery place To see that Death hath [done] the world disgrace. And Coridon, poore sillie wretched swaine, Doth make suche moane as if he wolde go mad; All in despaire to see good daies againe, To loose the ioy that on the earth he had; Who since the tyme he harde but of his wound, Lyvde like a ghost that goes vpon y? ground. And so forlorne abandonde all content Kepes in the caves where comfort is vnknowne; Borne but to lyue and only to lament The dolfull life that by his death hath growne; Who in his life wold lett him know no care, But by his death all greifes that euer are. Pan in a rage, hath broken all his pipes Pallas, alas, sitts poring on a booke; Her weeping eyes, see how Diana wypes, And poore Appollo castes a pittous looke; The Nymphes cumme in with such a wofull cryinge As if that Love or Venus laye a-dyinge. The nightingale is stopped in her throate [And] shriching owles do make a fearfull noyse; The dolfull ravenes do singe a deadly note, And litle wrennes the end of eagles tryes; The phœnix drowpes and falcons beat their winges, To heer how swannes of death and sorrow singes. The trees are blasted and the leaves do wither The daintye greene is turnèd to darke graye; The gallant vines are shruncke and gone together, And all the flowres do fade and fall awaie; The springes are dride and all y? fishe scales beaten, And all good fruite the earth itself hath eaten. Oh what a woe it is to see the woes Where nought but woe is lefte to looke vpon; A greif to[o] great for reason to disclose And in effectes a death to studdy on; Wher man and beaste, birdes, fishes, flowres, trees, Do halfe the hope of all theire comforte leese. When on the earth was euer such a night? Hardly the world can such a sorrow haue; Neuer did death more cease vpon delight Then when this knight was caryed to his grave; Which when I sawe so neere my hart I sett As while I liue I neuer can forgett. First cummes the brother all in mourning blacke, Morning indeede in bodie and in minde; Foldinge the armes as if his hart wold cracke, Feling the death that Loue and Nature finde; Looking vpon the last of his delight: Oh heavnly God, it was a wofull sight! The schollres cumme with lachrimis Amoris, As though theire hartes were hoples of releif; The soldiers come with tonitru clamoris, To make the heavnes acquainted with theire greif; The noble peeres in ciuitatis portis In hartes ingravne cumme w?? dolor mortis. The straungers cumme, oh che mala sorte The servantes cumme with morte di la vita; The secrete frendes with morte piu che morte, And all with their felicita finita; Now for my selfe oh dolor infernale Da vivere tal et non viuer tale. Now if the greif of all the world be great, How great is his that hath the greif of all! Who doth in thought more deadly panges repeate Then euer dyd to all the world befall; Whose deadly pashions plainlie do approue, The only terme, Anatomy of Loue. But since I see there is no remedye What God will haue must neuer be withstood; And mal content is but a mallady That maie consume but can do litle good; I will to God referre my whole releif In heavnly cure of my vnhappie greif. And on my knees before His holy wyll To caste on me those swete and loving eyes That heale the hart of euery [hatefull] yll And giue the life where comfort neuer dyes; And wher my hart is gone my hope may thither That faith and loue may liue in heavne together. But till my sowle may see that heavnly sweete, Wher vertue doth her deerest loue embrace; Wher comfort, care, and kinde affect may meete And share the ioye to see eche other's face; Vpon the tombe I will the sorrowes sett downe That all the world maie reede of thy renowne. Perfection peereles, vertue w??out pride, Honor and learninge linkt w?? highest love: Ioye of the thought in true direction tryed, Life of the love, that highest hono? proue; In Angells' Armes w?? heavnlie handes imbraced, Paradise pleased, and all the world disgraced. Seeke all the world, or seeke and never finde In earthlie mould the mount of such a mynde; Devinest gueste that God and man bestoweth, In glory such as from such glorye groweth. And of the ioyes that haue all greife begonne, Yet let me weepe when all the world hath done. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GLEANINGS. I. A FAREWELL TO TOWN. Since secret Spite hath sworn my wo, And I am driven by Destiny Against my will, God knows, to go From Place of gallant company, And, in the stead of sweet delight, To reap the fruits of foul despite: As it hath been a custom long, To bid farewell when men depart, So will I sing this solemn song, Farewell, to some, with all my heart: But those my friends: but to my foes, I wish a nettle in their nose. I wish my friends their hearts' content: My foes, again, the contrary: I wish myself, the time were spent That I must spend in misery: I wish my deadly foe, no worse Than want of friends, and empty purse. But, now my wishes thus are done, I must begin to bid farewell: With friends and foes I have begun, And therefore, now I cannot tell Which first to choose, or ere I part, To write a farewell from my heart. First, place of worldly Paradise, Thou gallant court, to thee farewell! For froward Fortune me denies Now longer near to thee to dwell. I must go live, I wot not where, Nor how to live when I come there. And next, adieu you gallant dames, The chief of noble youth's delight! Untoward Fortune now so frames, That I am banish'd from your sight, And, in your stead, against my will, I must go live with country Jill. Now next, my gallant youths farewell; My lads that oft have cheer'd my heart! My grief of mind no tongue can tell, To think that I must from you part. I now must leave you all, alas, And live with some odd lobcock ass! And now farewell thou gallant lute, With instruments of music's sounds! Recorder, citern, harp, and flute, And heavenly descants on sweet grounds; I now must leave you all indeed, And make some music on a reed! And now you stately stamping steeds And gallant geldings fair, adieu! My heavy heart for sorrow bleeds, To think that I must part with you: And on a strawen pannel sit, And ride some country carting tit! And now farewell both spear and shield, Caliver, pistol, arquebus, See, see, what sighs my heart doth yield To think that I must leave you thus; And lay aside my rapier blade, And take in hand a ditching spade! And you farewell, all gallant games, Primero and Imperial, Wherewith I used, with courtly dames, To pass away the time withall: I now must learn some country plays For ale and cakes on holidays! And now farewell each dainty dish, With sundry sorts of sugar'd wine! Farewell, I say, fine flesh and fish, To please this dainty mouth of mine! I now, alas, must leave all these, And make good cheer with bread and cheese! And now, all orders due, farewell! My table laid when it was noon; My heavy heart it irks to tell My dainty dinners all are done: With leeks and onions, whig and whey, I must content me as I may. And farewell all gay garments now, With jewels rich, of rare device! Like Robin Hood, I wot not how, I must go range in woodman's wise; Clad in a coat of green or grey, And glad to get it if I may. What shall I say, but bid adieu To every dra[ch]m of sweet delight, In place where pleasure never grew, In dungeon deep of foul despite, I must, ah me! wretch, as I may, Go sing the song of welaway! II. Not long ago, as I at supper sat, Whereas indeed I had exceeding cheer, In order serv'd, with store of this and that, With flaggons fill'd with wine, and ale, and beer, I did behold, (that well set out the rest!) A troop of dames in brave attire addrest.— Now gan I guess, by outward countenance, The disposition of each dainty dame: And though, perhaps, I missed some by chance, I hit some right, I do not doubt the same. But shall I tell of each one what I guest? No, fie! for why? fond tattling breeds unrest. But let them be such as they were! by chance Our banquet done, we had our music by, And then, you know, the youth must needs go dance, First, galliards; then larousse; and heidegy; ‘Old lusty gallant;’ ‘all flow'rs of the bloom;’ And then a hall! for dancers must have room. And to it then; with set, and turn about, Change sides, and cross, and mince it like a hawk; Backwards and forwards, take hands then, in and out; And, now and then, a little wholesome talk, That none could hear, close rowned in the ear; Well! I say nought: but much good sport was there. Then might my minion hear her mate at will: But, God forgive all such as judge amiss! Some men, I know, would soon imagine ill, By secret spying of some knavish kiss: But let them leave such jealousy for shame! Dancers must kiss: the law allows the same. And, when friends meet, some merry sign must pass Of welcoming unto each other's sight: And for a kiss that's not so much, alas! Dancers, besides, may claim a kiss of right, After the dance is ended, and before. But some will kiss upon kiss: that goes sore. But what? I had almost myself forgot To tell you on of this same gentle crew; Some were, alas, with dancing grown so hot, As some must sit; while others danced anew: And thus forsooth our dancing held us on Till midnight full; high time for to be gone. But to behold the graces of each dame! How some would dance as though they did but walk; And some would trip, as though one leg were lame; And some would mince it like a sparrow-hawk; And some would dance upright as any bolt; And some would leap and skip like a young colt! And some would fidge, as though she had the itch; And some would bow half crooked in the joints; And some would have a trick; and some a twitch; Some shook their arms, as they had hung up points: With thousands more that were too long to tell, But made me laugh my heart sore, I wot well. But let them pass: and now ‘sir we must part; ‘I thank you, sir, for my exceeding cheer.’— ‘Welcome’ (quoth the good man) ‘with all my heart: ‘In faith the market serves but ill to year, ‘When one could not devise more neat to dress.’— Jesus! (thought I) what means this foolishness? But let that pass.—Then, parting at the door, Believe me now, it was a sport to see What stir there was, who should go out before; Such curtsies low, with ‘Pray you pardon me’— ‘You shall not choose’—‘In faith you are to blame.’— Goodsooth! (thought I) a man would think the same! Now being forth (with much ado) at last, Then part they all; each one unto their house; And who had mark'd the pretty looks that past From privy friend unto his pretty mouse, Would say with me, at twelve o'clock at night, It was a parting, trust me, worth the sight. But let them part, and pass in God his name! God speed them well, I pray, and me no worse! Some are gone home with dancing almost lame; And some go light by means of empty purse: And, to be short, home goeth every one, And home go I unto my lodge alone. III. A Sweet contention between Love, his Mistress, and Beauty. Love and my Mistress were at strife Who had the greatest power on me; Betwixt them both, oh, what a life! Nay, what a death is this to be! She said, she did it with her eye; He said, he did it with his dart; Betwixt them both (a silly wretch!) 'Tis I that have the wounded heart. She said, she only spake the word That did enchant my peering sense; He said, he only gave the sound That enter'd heart without defence. She said, her Beauty was the mark That did amaze the highest mind; He said, he only made the mist Whereby the senses grew so blind. She said, that, only for her sake, The best would venture life and limb: He said, she was too much deceiv'd; They honour'd her, because of him. Long while, alas, she would not yield, But it was she that rul'd the roast; Until, by proof, she did confess, If he were gone her joy was lost. And then she cried, ‘Oh, dainty Love, ‘I now do find it is for thee ‘That I am lov'd and honour'd both, ‘And thou hast power to conquer me!’ But, when I heard her yield to Love, Oh! how my heart did leap for joy, That now I had some little hope To have an end of mine annoy! For though that Fancy Beauty found A power all too pitiless, Yet Love would never haue the heart To leave his servant comfortless. But as too soon before the field The trumpets sound the overthrow, So all too soon I joy'd too much, For I awak'd, and nothing so. IV.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Thoughts make men sigh, sighes make men sick at heart, Sicknes consumes, consumption killes at last: Death is the end of everie deadlie smart, And sweete the joy where euery paine is past. But oh! the time of death too long delayed, Where tried patience is too ill apayed! Hope harpes on heaven but lives in halfe a hell; Hart thinkes of love, but findes a deadly hate; Eares harke for blis, but heare a dolefull bell; Eyes looke for joy, but see a wofull state. But eyes and eares and hart and hope deceaued, Tongue tels a truth, how is the mind conceaved. Conceited thus to thinke but say no more, To sigh and sob till sorrow haue no end; And so to die, till death may life restore, Or carefull faith may finde a constant friend; That patience may yet in her passion prove, Just at my death I found my life of loue! V.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What poore astronomers are they Take women's eyes for stars, And set their thoughts in battell ray To fight such idle warres, When in the end they shall approve 'Tis but a jeast drawne out of loue. And love itselfe is but a jeast, Devisde by idle heads To catch yong fancies in the neast, And lay it in fooles beds; That being hatcht in beauties eyes, They may be flidge ere they be wise. But yet it is a sport to see How wit will run on wheeles, While will cannot perswaded be With that which reason feeles; That womens eyes and starres are odde, And love is but a fained God. But such as will run mad with will, I cannot cleare their sight, But leave them to their studie still, To looke where is no light; Till time too late we make them trie They study false astronomie. VI. A Prayer.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Oh, with Thy grace my heart inspire, To bring forth fruites of Thy desire. Give me thy Peter's penitence, Paul's faith, and Job his patience, And Marie's grace, and John his loue, That in my heart I may approue. When all these graces meete in mee, What ioy my soule shall have in Thee: But oh, my God! my heart doth ake, My soule with trembling fear doth quake, That sinne hath brought me in such plight As makes me ouglie in Thy sight; And I (O wretch!) am one of those Whom Thou hast reckoned for Thy foes, And that Thy mercie will not heare mee, Nor comfort euer shall come near mee; My prayer turned into sinne, No gate of grace shall enter in; But all my thoughts are farre amisse, Shall banisht be from hope of blisse; And my poor soule, by sinne's desart, Condemn'd vnto eternall smart. And yet again, meethinks, I see How Thy great mercie lookes on mee, And tels me faith may be victorious, While grace will be in mercie glorious, And what true hartes do truelie proue, That turne to Thee in teares of loue; In which vnfaigned faithfull teares, Wherein the wofull spirit weares, I humbly fall at Mercie's feete, Where grace, and loue, and glorie meete; And in teares of true contrition Thus makes my wofull soule's petition: In mercie looke on me, deare God; Forgive my sinnes, forbeare Thy rod; Behold my griefe and ease my paine, And take me to Thy grace againe, That if I may see that bright Sunne shine, Where glorie neuer can decline; Where I with Simeon's ioy may sing When I embrace my holy King, And [all] sinne and sorrowes cease, As my soule doth rest in peace. VII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Among the groves, the woods and thickes, The bushes, brambles, and the briers, The shrubbes, the stubbes, the thornes, and prickes, The ditches, plashes, lakes and miers. Where fish nor fowle, nor bird nor beast, Nor living thing may take delight, Nor reason's rage may looke for rest, Till heart be dead of hatefull spight: Within the caue of care unknowne, Where hope of comfort all decayes, Let me with sorrow sit alone In dolefull thoughts to end my dayes. And when I heare the stormes arise, That troubled ghosts doe leave the grave; With hellish sounds of horror's cries, Let me goe look out of my cave. And when I feel what paines they bide, That doe the greatest torments prove, Then let not me the sorrow hide, That I have suffer'd by my love. Where losses, crosses, care and griefe, With ruthfull, spitefull, hatefull hate, Without all hope of hap's reliefe, Doe tugge and teare the heart to naught; But sigh, and say, and sing, and sweare, It is too much for one to beare.</field>
