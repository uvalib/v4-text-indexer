Whan Phebus entred was / in Gemyny Shynynge aboue / in his fayre golden spere And horned Dyane / than but one degre In the Crabbe hadde entred / fayre and clere Whan that Aurora / dyde well appere In the depured ayre / and cruddy fyrmament Forthe than I walked / without impedyment In to a medowe / bothe gaye and gloryous Whiche Flora depaynted with many a colour Lyke a place of pleasure / most solacyous Encensynge out / the aromatyke odoure Of zepherus brethe / whiche that euery floure Throughe his fume / dothe alwaye engendre So as I went / amonge the floures tendre By sodayne chaunce / a fayre pathe I founde On whiche I loked / and ryght ofte I mused And than all aboute / I behelde the grounde With the fayre pathe / whiche I sawe so vsed My chaunce or fortune / I nothynge refused But in the pathe / forthe I went a pace To knowe whyther / and vnto what place It wolde me brynge / by ony symylytude So forthe I wente / were it ryght or wronge Tyll that I sawe / of ryall pulcrytude Before my face / an ymage fayre and stronge With two fayre handes / stretched out alonge Vnto two hye wayes / there in pertycyon And in the ryght hande / was this dyscrypcyon This is the streyght waye / of contemplacyon Vnto the Ioyfull toure pedurable Who that wyll walke / vnto that mancyon He must forsake / all thynges varyable With the vayneglory / somoche deceyuable And thoughe the waye / be harde and daungerous The laste ende therof / shall be ryght precyous And in the other hande / ryght fayre wryten was This is the waye / of worldly dygnyte Of the actyfe lyfe / who wyll in it passe Vnto the toure / of fayre dame beaute Fame shall tell hym / of the waye in certaynte Vnto labell pucell / the fayre lady excellent Aboue all other / in clere beaute splendent I behelde ryght well / bothe the wayes twayne And mused oft / whiche was best to take The one was sharpe / the other was more playne And vnto my selfe / I began to make A sodayne argument / for I myght not slake Of my grete musynge / of this ryall ymage And of these two wayes / somoche in vsage For this goodly pycture / was in altytude Nyne fote and more / of fayre marble stone Ryght well fauoured / and of grete fortytude Thoughe it were made / full many yeres agone Thus stode I musynge / my selfe all alone By ryhgt longe tyme / but at the last I went The actyfe waye / with all my hole entent Thus all alone / I began to trauayle Forthe on my waye / by longe contynuaunce But often tymes / I hadde grete meruayle Of the bypathes / so full of pleasaunce Whiche for to take / I hadde grete doubtaunce But euermore / as nere as I myght I toke the waye / whiche went before me ryght And at the last / whan Phebus in the west Gan to auayle / with all his beames mery Whan clere Dyana / in the fayre southest Gan for to ryse / lyghtynge our emyspery With cloudes clere / without the stormy pery Me thought a fer / I hadde a vysyon Of a pycture / of meruoylous facyon To whiche I went / without lenger delaye Beholdynge well / the ryght fayre purtrayture Made of fyne copre / shynynge fayre and gaye Full well truely / accordynge to mesure And as I thought .ix. fote of stature Yet in the breste / with lettres fayre ande blewe Was wryten / a sentence olde and trewe This is the waye / and the sytuacyon Vnto the toure / of famous doctryne Who that wyll lerne / must be ruled by reason And with all his dylygence / he must enclyne Slouthe to eschewe / and for to determyne And set his hert / to be intellygyble To a wyllynge herte / is nought Impossyble Besyde the ymage / I adowne me sette After my laboure / myselfe to repose Tyll at the last / with a gaspynge nette Slouthe my heed caught / with his hole purpose It vayled not / the body for to dyspose Agaynst the heed / whan it is applyed The heed must rule / it can not be denyed Thus as I satte / in a deedly slombre Of a grete horne / I herde a ryall blast With whiche I awoke / and hadde a grete wondre From whens it came / it made me sore agast I loked aboute / the nyght was well nere paste And fayre golden Phebus / in the morowe graye With cloude reed began / to breke the daye I sawe come rydynge / in a valaye ferre A goodly lady / enuyronned aboute With tongues of fyre / as bryght as ony sterre That fyry flambes / ensensed alwaye out Whiche I behelde / and was in grete doubt Her palfraye swyfte / rennynge as the wynde With two whyte grehoundes / that were not behynde Whan that these grehoundes / had me so espyed With faunynge chere / of grete humylyte In goodly hast / they fast vnto me hyed I mused why / and wherfore it

shewed me that fauour What was my name / she axed me treuly To whome I sayde / it was la graunde Amour Besechynge you / to be to me socour To the toure of doctryne / and also me tell Your propre name / and where you do dwell My name quod she / in all the worlde is knowen Yclypped Fame / in euery regyon For I my horne / in sondry wyse haue blowen After the dethe / of many a champyon And with my

beneuolence Of all metalles / he made deuysyon One frome an other / by good prousyyon And than also / as some poetes fayne He founde shotynge / and drawenge of the bowe Yet as of that / I am nothynge certayne But for his connynge / of hye degre and lowe He was well beloued / as I do well knowe Throughe whose labour / and aye besy cure His fame shall lyue / and shall ryght longe endure In whose tyme reygned / also in Thessayle A parte of Grece / the kynge Melyzyus That was ryght stronge / and fyerce in batayle By whose labour / as the story sheweth vs He brake fyrst horses wylde and rygoryous Techynge his men / on them ryght well to ryde And he hymselfe / dyde fyrst the horse bestryde Also Mynerue / the ryght hardy goddes In the same tyme / of so hyghe renowne Vaynquysshed Pallas / by her grete worthynesse And fyrste made harneys / to leye his pryde adowne Whose grete defence / in euery realme and towne Was spredde aboute / for her hye chyualry Whiche by her harneys / wanne the vyctory Doth not remayne / yet in remembraunce The famous actes / of the noble hercules That so many monstres / put to vtteraunce By his grete wysdome / and hye prowes As the recule of Troye / bereth good wytnes That in his tyme / he wolde no batayle take But for the welthe / of the comyns sake Thus the hole myndes / were euer fyxte and set Of noble men / in olde tyme to deuyse Suche thynges as were / to the comyn proffet For in that tyme / suche was theyr goodly guyse That after dethe theyr fame shoulde aryse For to endure / and abyde in mynde As yet in bokes / we maye them

Besyde this toure of olde foundacyon There was a temple strongly edefyed To the hygh honoure and reputacyon Of the myghty Mars it was so fortefyed And for to know what it sygnyfyed I entred in and sawe of golde so pure Of worthy Mars the meruaylous pycture There was depaynted all aboute the wall The grete dystruccyon of the cyte of troye And the noble actes to reygne memoryall Of the worthy Ector that was all theyr Ioye His dolourous deth was herde to occoye And so whan Ector was cast all downe The hardy Troylus was moost hyghe of renowne And as I cast my syght so asyde Beholdynge Mars how wonderly he stode On a whele top with a lady of pryde Haunced aboute I thought nothynge but good But that she had two faces in one hode Yet I kneled adowne and made myne oryson To doughty Mars with grete deuocyon Sayenge / O Mars / O god of the warre The gentyll lodesterre of an hardy herte Dystyll adowne thy grace from so farre To cause all fere frome me to asterte That in the felde I may ryght well subuerte The hedyus monsters / and wynne the vyctory Of the sturdy grauntes with famous chyualry O prynce of honoure and of worthy fame O noble knyghtes of olde antyquyte O redouted courage the causer of theyr name Whose worthy actes fame caused to be In bokes wryten as ye may well se So gyue me grace ryght well to recure The power of fame / that shall longe endure I thought me past all chyldly ygnoraunce The .xxj. yere of my yonge flourynge aege I thought that Venus myght nothynge auaunce Her strength agaynst me with her lusty courage My wytte I thought had suche auauntage That it sholde rule bothe Venus and Cupyde But alas for wo for all my sodayne pryde. Whan that Phebus entred was in gemyne Towarde the crabbe takynge ascencyon At the tyme of the grete solempnyte From heuen aboue of goddes descencyon In a grete temple with hole entencyon As I went

condampned without ony grace As for to attayne ony prosperyte Whiche were a cause of grete iniquyte For ryche mennes goodes I must ofte translate Vnto the pore them for to eleuate And thyrdly I sholde lese my name For this worde fortune is well derefyde Of an accydent chaunce bothe good or shame Whan that the dede is so exemplefyde Wherfore by reason I must be duplyfyde And nothynge stable in myn

The chaunge of man so for to dyscure Accordynge to a moralyzacyon And of the trouth to make relacyon The man is fortune in the propre dede And not thou that causeth hym to spede What nedeth hym vnto

And so a brydle she put in his mouthe Vpon his backe she rode bothe northe and southe Aboute a chambre as some cherkes wene Of many persones it was openly sene Lo what is loue that can so sore blynde A phylosophre to brynge hym out of kynde For loue dothe pas ony maner of thynge It is harde and preuy in werkynge So on the grounde Arystotle crepte And in his tethe she longe the brydle kepte Tyll she therof had ynougher fyll And yet for this he neuer had his wyll She dyde nothynge but for to mocke and scorne This true louer whiche was for loue forlorne But whan he knewe the poynt of the case The fyry angre dyde his herte enbrace That he hym selfe dyde anone well knowe His anger dyde his loue so ouerthrowe And ryght anone as some poetes wryte He the grete mockage dyde her well acquyte. Dyde not a woman the famous Vyrgyle By her grete fraude full craftely begyle For on a day for his owne dysporte To the courte of Rome he gan to resporte Amonge the ladyes the tyme for to passe Tyll at

Beynge ryght hygh and a wyndowe withall Soone at nyght whan all folke be at reste I shall take a basket as me thynketh beste And therto I shall a longe corde well tye And frome the wyndowe lete it

rewarded His payne and sorow she nothynge regarded Thus at the last he adowne was brought Replete with shame it vayled hym ryght nought Thus with grete angre he his loue confounded Helynge the stroke whiche that she had wounded And by his crafte he in Rome dyde drenche Euery fyre / for he lefte none to quenche And towarde Rome a grete tyrcuyte aboute There was no fyre that was vn put oute He at

Thus godfrey gobyloue dyde make suche a sporte That many louers to hym dyde resorte Whan I sawe tyme I went to sapyence Shewynge to her with all my dylygence How that my herte by Venus was trapte With a snare of loue so preuely berapte And in her toure to haue a dwellynge place I seke aduentures to attayne her grace Her name quod I / la belle pucell is Bothe est and west she is well knoken ywys And my name la graunde amoure is called Whose herte with payne she all aboute hath walled With her beaute whiche dame nature create Aboue all other in moost hye estate Well sayd sapyence I thynke in my mynde Her loue and fauoure you shall attayne by kynde And I wyll drawe to you incontynent All your complaynt as is conuenyent! Vnto dame Venus to se derectly For your payne and sorowe soone a remedy She drewe my pyteous lamentacyon Accordynge to this supplycacyon.

Her eyen gray / her nose strayght and fayre In her whyte chekes the fayre blode it wente As amonge the whyte the reed to repayre Her mouthe ryght small her brethe swete of ayre Her lyppes softe and
