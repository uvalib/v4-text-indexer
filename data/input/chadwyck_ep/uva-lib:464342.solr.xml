      <field name="fulltext">To the Honourable, S?. JOHN ROBINSON Knight and Baronet, His Majesties Lieutenant of the Tower of LONDON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his dear friend Mr. Alex. Brome, upon the publishing his Poems. My kind Affections will shew forth thy wit, Although't be by a simple opposite; For thou preventest all Ingenuous proems, Ingrossing all the wit within thy Poems; But yet there's something left for me to do, Which would bo folly if perform'd by you: And that's to praise loth thee, and them, whose glory Shall reign with thy loyal Congratulatory And daring Speech, made in Clothworkers-Hall, Which overcame, and made the General, Who made us all, by making all his men, Rank as they were, to bring our Kings agen, By being subject to our Lawful Prince, Whose damned Exile, made us Slaves e're since: And so confin'd thy fancy, that thy Fame (Till his return was) kept without a Name. Though thou hast been Libellish all these times, Against the changing Powers; yet some Crimes Thou didst conceal, which did thy prudence shew, To keep their vices for their overthrow; Reserving still some strength as a redoubt, Fearing the Rumpish rear might face about; And made our Kings de facto, and of right In Charles the Second justly to unite; Who soon inlarg'd thy Muse, which free, Hath bound us to our Laws for liberty: To whom I do subscribe, (since our Commander, In name's as good as is Great Alexander). Cha. Steynings. To his Ingenious Friend Mr. A. B. upon his most excellent Poems. In our late Chaos, when the giddy world Was to th'Abysse of curs'd Rebellion hurl'd: And its distemper'd Pilots did advance Nothing but dull and sordid Ignorance; When to be either learn'd, or witty, gave Occasion to make this or t'other slave: Then Atlas-like thou didst that world sustain, Destin'd to thrive by thy Poetick-brain. Divinity we there saw stifled, and The Law was only practis'd under-hand: The Glory of our School eclips'd; a shade, No life, nor Beauty gave, but Horrour had All Modes and Methods Ravish'd from our eye, To cancel Name of King and Loyalty; For each of which, thou mad'st a fit supply, As some instruct their Boyes by Poesie. Nay Millions more had driven with that stream, Had not thy sense and light diverted them, Those who droop'd in despair, had drop'd away, But Thy Prophetick Numbers made them stay; And did re-animate their spirits here, Fore-telling them their Sun would once uppear. Most of the younger Fry, that never saw A Crown or Gospel flourish with the Law, Had been deprav'd in soul, but that the Starre (Thy Lines put forth) directed how and where They ought to worship, so they were kept free From the Times guilt, others Apostacie. The puisne Law-wrights too may spare to look On this grave Sirs reports, or t'others Book For what's Authentique, but (at will) from thee, May freight their Skuls with Law's Epitomie: And henceforth we shall have them cease to Bawl Cook upon Littleton, but Brome on all. The Brethren of the Crowd throughout the Town, Who lost their time to keep't, were out of Tune More than their Instruments; as if their Arts Were meerly but to play, not play their parts, Till furnish'd with a Song or two from you; Then they grew proud upon't, and wealthy too; Nor was't ill husbandry, or either's wrong, To give, or get their money for a Song. We find in every Science, Art, or Trade, Ambition some Competitors has made; But here THOU art particular, and like, For Poesie, as Painting was Vandyke. Such reputation hast thou gain'd, that when A piece of Wit has by some other Men Been richly cloath'd, and spoken; Hear their dooms, Upon our lives, 'Tis Alexander Brome's. But ? As Pictures by their soyles seem better drest, I can but be, Thy Blackamore at Best. Valentine Oldis. [PART I.] Many of the poems in this book appear elsewhere in English Poetry. Song XXIX. Out of Catallus. 1 My Lesbia, let us live and love, Let crabbed Age talk what it will. The Sun when down, returns above, But we, once dead, must be so still. 2 Kiss me a thousand times, and then Give me a hundred kisses more, Now kiss a thousand times agen, Then t'other hundred as before. 3 Come a third thousand, and to those Another hundred kisses fix; That done, to make the sweeter close, Wee'l millions of kisses mix. 4 And huddle them together so, That we our selves shan't know how many, And others can't their number know, If we should envy'd be by any. 5 And then, when we have done all this, That our pleasures may remain, Wee'l continue on our bliss, By unkissing all again. 6 Thus wee'l love, and thus wee'l live, While our posting minutes fly, Wee'l have no time to vex or grieve, But kiss and unkiss till we die. Song XXXVIII. Advice to Cælia. 1 My lovely Cælia, while thou dost enjoy Beauty and youth, be sure to use 'um, And be not fickle, be not coy, Thy self or Lovers to destroy. Since all those Lillies and those Roses, Which Lovers find, or love supposes, To flourish in thy face, Will tarry but a little space; And youth and beauty are but only lent To you by nature, with this good intent, You should enjoy, but not abuse 'um, And when enjoyments may be had, not fondly to refuse 'um. 2 Let lovers flatt'ry ne'r prevail with thee; Nor their oyl'd complements deceive thee, Their vows and protestations be Too often meer Hypocrisie: And those high praises of the witty May all be costly, but not fit ye, Or if it true should be Now what thy lovers say of thee, Sickness or age will quickly strip away Those fading glories of thy youthful May; And of thy graces all bereave thee; Then those that thee ador'd before will slight thee, and so leave thee. 3 Then while thou'rt fair and young, be kind, but wise, Doat not, nor proudly use denying; That tempting toy thy beauty lies Not in thy face, but lovers eyes. And he that doats on thee may smother His love, 'ith beauty of another, Or flying at all game May quench, or else divert his flame. His reason too may chance to interpose, And love declines as fast as reason grows. There is a knack to find loves treasures Too young, too old, too nice, too free, too slow, destroys your pleasures. Song XXXIX. The Mad Lover. I have been in love, and in debt, and in drink This many and many a year; And those three are plagues enough one would think For one poor mortal to bear. 'Twas drink made me fall into Love, And Love made me run into debt, And though I have strugled and strugled and strove, I cannot get out of them yet. There's nothing but money can cure me, And rid me of all my pain. 'Twil pay all my debts, And remove all my lets, And my Mistris that cannot endure me, Will love me, and love me again, Then I'll fall to loving and drinking amain. Song XL. The Murmurer. 1 Let's lay aside plotting and thinking, And medling with matters of State, Since we have the freedome of drinking, 'Tis a folly to scribble or prate. The great ones have nothing to think on, But how to make fools of the small; We Cavaliers suffer and drink on, And care not a louse for 'um all. 2 We thought it was matter of danger To be Rebels against our Prince; But he that is not a meer stranger, May see it is otherwise since. 'Tis only the petty Delinquent With whom the matter goes hard; Where ever much boldness and Chink went, There honour's bestow'd and reward. 3 To keep up a turbulent nature, And fear neither God nor the King; To be a significant Traytor, Is an advantageous thing. But since it has ever been so, And so it will ever be, Let it end as it did begin, so That it never do trouble me. Song XLI. A Round. Sit round, sit round, leave musing and thinking, Hang caring and working, let's fall to our drinking; The works of our hands Shall purchase no lands, But in spight of all care wee'l be frolick; He that does the glass skip, May he die of the pip, Or be lowsie that none shall endure him; Or be plagu'd with the stone or the cholick, And find ne'r a Surgeon to cure him. Song XLII. The Cavalier. We have ventur'd our estates, And our liberties and lives, For our Master and his mates, And been toss'd by cruel fates, Where the rebellious Devil drives, So that not one of ten survives. We have laid all at stake For his Majesty's sake, We have fought, we have paid, We've been sold and betray'd. And tumbled from nation to nation, But now those are thrown down That usurped the Crown, Our hopes were that we All rewarded should be, But we're paid with a Proclamation. Now the times are turn'd about, And the Rebels race is run: That many headed beast, the Rout, Who did turn the Father out When they saw they were undon, Were for bringing in the Son. That phanatical crue Which made us all rue, Have got so much wealth, By their plunder and stealth, That they creep into profit and power: And so come what will, They'll be uppermost still; And we that are low, Shall still be kept so While those domineer and devour. Yet we will be loyal still, And serve without reward or hire, To be redeem'd from so much ill, May stay our stomacks, though not fill; And if our patience do not tire, We may in time have our desire. Song XLIII. A Wife. 1 Since thou'rt condemn'd to wed a thing, And that same thing must be a she; And that same she to thee must cling For term of life of her and thee; I'll tell thee what this thing shall bee. 2 I would not have her virtuous, For such a wife I ne'er did see; And 'tis a madness to suppose What never was, nor e'er shall bee; To seem so is enough to thee. 3 Do not desire she should be wise, Yet let her have a waggish wit; No circumventing subtilties, But pretty slights to please and hit, And make us laugh at her, or it. 4 Nor must thou have one very just, Lest she repay thee in thy kind; And yet she must be true to trust; Or if to sport she has a mind, Let her be sure to keep thee blind. 5 One part of valour let her have; Not to return but suffer ill, To her own passion be no slave But to thy law's obedient still, And unto thine submit her will. 6 Be thou content she have a tongue, That's active so it be not lowd; And so she be straight-limb'd and young, Though not with beauty much endow'd, No matter, so she be but proud. 7 Tir'd she should be, not satisfi'd, But alwaies tempting thee for more, So cunningly she bee n't espy'd. Let her act all parts like a whore, So she bee n't one, I'ld ask no more. 8 But above all things, let her be Short liv'd and rich, no strong-dock'd Jone, That dares to live till 53, Find this wife, if thou must have one; But there's no wife so good as none. Song XLIV. On the Queens Arrival. 1. From the Lusitanian Shore, Our triumphing Ships are come Proudly with their royal lading, Which Britain, that now truly's great, enjoys at home, And needs no more abroad to rome, But may now give over trading. For we have that Jewel whose value is more, Then all one India's Spice, or t'other India's Ore. 2. Katharina Queen of love! England's joy and admiration! Fit to be made a Spouse to Jove, Spains terrour, yet their emulation; The Portuguez riches, their glory and pride, Who now are become but a rifled nation, Such a cœlestial consort to bring To the embraces of Brittains King: The world yields not so glorious a Bride, Nor is there a Prince that merits the bliss Of so great beauty, but so good a King as this. 3. Now let sea and land rejoyce, Tagus yields us golden sands; All that have feet, or hands, or voyce, In these two united lands, Lift them up, rejoyce and sing; Blessed Queen and happy King! Chorus. Long live Charles and Katharina! To testifie our joy, We sung Vive le Roy; But now wee'l sing Vive le Roy &amp; la Reigna. Song XLV. A Friend. Fain would I find out a friend that is true; That we may live freely together: But men are grown false, and friends are but few, And as fickle in mind as a feather. That man I suspect, who much zeal does pretend, And will not our frailties connive at, His looks and his words are both fram'd to his end, While some underhand-cheat he does drive at. He that still laughs in tune, and smiles in my face, And appears very courteous and civil; If I trust him but once, I shall find him as base And perfidious as the Devil. A man of a niggardly soul I despise, His Avarice makes him slavish; For he that his wealth more than honour doth prize, Will not only be sordid but knavish. He that soon grows rich from a beggerly life, Is not for my conversation; He's as proud as a Presbyter Parson's wife, Or a new made corporation. But he that is generous, jolly and wise, Good natur'd and just to any one, Such person I love and extol to the skies; He shall be my friend and companion. PART. II. Song XXXII. Made and Set Extempore. 1 When our glasses flow with Wine, And our souls with Sack are rais'd; When we're jeer'd we do not repine; Nor are proud when we are prais'd: 'Tis Sack alone can raise our souls, A pin for Christning drinking-bowles. 2 Let the Drawer raise our fancies, With his wit-refining drink; Hang your stories and Romances; Those are fit for them that think; Let him love that has a mind, We to drinking are inclin'd. 3 Wit and love, are th'only things Which fill the thoughts of Kings and us; Imagination makes us Kings, And that's rais'd by doing thus. Drink your Sack, let wit alone, Wit by drinking best is shown. Song XXXIII. The Answer to the Curse against Ale. 1 O Gag for shame that strumpet muse! Let not her Spanish tongue abuse Our wholsome and Heroick English juice. 2 'Twas not this loyal liquor shut Our Gates against our Soveraign, but Strange drinks into one tub together put. 3 When Ale was drink Canonical, There were no theeves, nor watch, nor wall, Men neither stole, nor lack'd, for Ale was all. 4 That Poet ought be dry or dumb, And to our brown-bowls never come, Who drinking Ale, vents only dregs and scum. 5 Nor had that Souldier drunk enough, For Ale both valour gives and buffe, Makes men unkickable, and cudgel-proof. 6 'Twas the meal, not meal-man, was the cause The mill fell down; for one small clause In one meal-act, hath overthrown our lawes. 7 The worth of Ale none can proclaim, But by th'assistance of the same, From it our Land derives its noblest name. 3 But now my youth and pride are gone, And age and cares come creeping on, And business checks my love; What need I take a needless toyle, To spend my labour, time and oyl, Since no design can move. For now the cause is ta'n away, What reason ist th'effect should stay? 4 'Tis but a folly now for me, To spend my time and industry, About such useless wit; For when I think I have done well, I see men laugh, but cannot tell, Where't be at me, or it. Great madness 'tis to be a drudge, When those that cannot write, dare judge. 5 Besides the danger that ensu'th, To him that speaks, or writes the truth, The prœmium is so small, To be called Poet, and wear bayes, And Factor turn of Songs and Playes, This it no wit at all. Wit only good to sport and sing, 's a needless and an endless thing. 6 Give me the Wit that can't speak sense, Nor read it, but in's own defence, Ne'r learn'd but of his Grannum, He that can buy, and sell, and cheat, May quickly make a shift to get, His thousand pound per annum. And purchase without much ado, The Poems and the Poet too. XVIII. A Ballad. Old England is now a brave Barbary made, And every one has an ambition to ride her: K. Charles was a horseman that long us'd the trade, But he rode in a snaffle, and that could not guide her. Then the hungry Scot comes with spur and with switch, And would teach her to run a Geneva career; His Grooms were all Puritan, Traytor, and witch; But she soon threw them down, with their pedlery geer. The long Parliament next came all to the block, And they this untamable Palfry would ride; But she would not bear all that numerous flock; At which they were fain themselves to divide. Jack Presbyter first gets the Steed by the head, While the reverend Bishops had hold of the bridle: Jack said through the nose, they their flocks did not feed, But sate still on the beast, and grew aged and idle: And then comes the Rout with broomsticks inspir'd, And pull'd down their Graces, their sleeves, and their train, And sets up sir Jack, who the beast quickly tyr'd, With a journey to Scotland, &amp; thence back again. Jack rode in a dublet, with a yoke of prick-ears, A cursed splay-mouth, and a Covenant-spur, Rides switching and spurring with jealousies and fears, Till the poor famish'd beast was not able to stir. Next came th'Independant a dev'lish designer, And got himself call'd by a holier name; Makes Jack to unhorse, for he was diviner, And would make her travel as far's Amsterdam: But Nol a rank rider gets first in the saddle, And made her show tricks, and curvate and rebound; She quickly perceiv'd that he rode widdle, waddle, And like his Coach-horses threw his Highness to ground. Then Dick, being lame, rode holding by the pummel, Not having the wit to get hold of the rein; But the Jade did so snort at the sight of a Cromwel, That poor Dick and his kindred turn'd foot-men again. Next Fleetwood and Vane, with their Rascally pack, Would every one put their feet in the stirrup; But they pull' the saddle quite off of her back, And were all got under her before they were up. At last the King mounts her, and then she stood still, As his Bucephalus, proud of this Rider; She cheerfully yields to his power and skill, Who is careful to feed her, and skilful to guide her. EPISTLES. XLIX. To his Friend Thomas Stanley, Esq; on his Odes Set and Published by Mr. John Gamble. Stanley the Darling of Apollo, thou That mak'st at once both Verse and Musick too; So sweet a Master of so sweet a Muse, Whom not to name with honour, were t'abuse. How thy words flow! How sweetly do they Chyme, When thy pure Couplets do imbrace in Rhyme! How quick, how lovely, and how full of Sence Thy Fancy is, and all that springs from thence! Which Gamble has enliv'ned by his Art, And breath' an Active Soul through every part: And so deduc'd thy Mind to us, that we May feast our Ears and Souls with rarity. How much to Thee, how much to Him we owe, We can conceive, but cannot make you know; Nor have we thanks proportion'd to your worth, Thou that didst make, and He that set them forth, In such a lively Dress too, We admire What we cann't praise, what we cann't do, Desire; And therefore turn our praises into prayers, That Thou'lt make more such Odes, He more such Ayres. I. On the famous Romance, called The innocent Impostor. 'Twill be expected now that I should raise Some Monument unto the Author's praise, The Works, or the Translators; else I fear, The Reader 'll wonder what I do make here. 'Tis grown Apocryphal, and by the Wits Quite voted down; Who hold it not befits A true-born Fancy, to be Smith-field-wise Put off with Toll and Vouchers; this defies Such Crutches; for 'tis of so clear a Nature, 'Twill pass without the Chaplains Imprimatur, Or our Certificates: Besides I carry Such a dislike to all things Customary, I'll cheat all expectation, and will be Thankful to them, but chiefly unto thee. In these Self-ended times we only do, Or thank or praise those we're beholding to: So call our Justice Charity, and say We do bestow, when we do only pay: For though the work be rare; yet should it be Still in its dress, what had it been to me? And though translated by this worthy pen, If not exposed to the view of Men, I had ne'r seen't perhaps, But since all three Have clubb'd in this production, I must be Grateful to all, and to give all your right, Must praise, and love, and thank Bellay, Dod, Wright. Who ere shall publish what's here done or said, From our Society must be banished: Let none by drinking do or suffer harm, And while we stay, let us be alwaies warm. LIV. Cromwell's Panegyrick, upon his riding in triumph over the baffled City of L. Shall Presbyterian bells ring Cromwel's praise, While we stand still and do no Trophies raise Unto his lasting name? Then may we be Hung up like bells for our malignity: Well may his Nose, that is dominical, Take pepper in't, to see no Pen at all Stir to applaud his merits, who hath lent Such valour, to erect a monument of lasting praise; whose name shall never dye, While England has a Church, or Monarchy. He whom the laurell'd Army home did bring Riding Triumphant o'r his conquer'd King, He is the Generals Cypher now; and when He's joyn'd to him, he makes that one a Ten. The Kingdomes Saint; England no more shall stir To cry St. Geooge, but now St. Oliver: He's the Realms Ensign; and who goes to wring His Nose, is forc'd to cry, God save the King. He that can rout an Army with his name, And take a City, ere he views the same: His Souldiers may want bread, but ne'r shall fear (While he's their General,) the want of Beer; No Wonder they wore Bayes, his Brewing-fat (Helicon-like) makes Poets Laureat: When Brains in those Castalian liquors swim, We sing no Heathenish Pean, but an Hymn; And that by th'Spirit too, for who can chuse But sing Hosanna to his King of Jews? Tremble you Scottish zealots, you that han't Freed any Conscience from your Covenant: That for those bald Appellatives of Cause, Religion, and the Fundamental Laws, Have pull'd the old Episcopacy down; And as the Miter, so you'll serve the Crown: You that have made the Cap to th'Bonnet vail, And make the Head a servant to the Tail. And you curst spawn of Publicans, that sit In every County, as a plague to it; That with your Yeomen Sequestrating Knaves, Have made whole Counties beggarly, and slaves. You Synod that have sate so long to know Whether we must believe in God, or no; You that have torn the Church, and sate t'impaire The Ten Commandements, the Creed, the Prayer; And made your honours pull down heavens glory, While you set up that Calf, your Directory: We shall no wicked Jews-ear'd Elders want, This Army's made of Churches Militant: These are new Tribes of Levi; for they be Clergy, yet of no University. Pull down your Crests; for every bird shall gather, From your usurping backs a stolen feather: Your Great Lay-Levite P. whose Margent tires The patient Reader, while he blots whole quires, Nay reams with Treason; and with Nonsence too, To justifie what e'r you say or do: Whose circumcised ears are hardly grown Ripe for another Persecution: He must to Scotland for another pair; For he will lose these, if he tarry here. Burges that Reverend Presby-dean of Pauls, Must (with his Poundage) leave his Cure of Souls, And into Scotland trot, that he may pick Out of the Kirk, and nick-nam'd Philoprick. And Will the Conquerour in a Scottish dance, Must lead his running Army into France. And that still-gaping Tophet Goldsmiths-Hall, With all its Furies, shall to ruine fall. We'll be no more gull'd by that Popish story, But shall reach heav'n without that Purgatory: What honour does he merit, what renown By whom all these oppressions are pull'd down: And such a Government is like to be In Church and State, as eye did never see: Magicians think he'll set up Common-Prayer; Looking in's face, they find the Rubrick there: His Name shall never dye, by fire nor floud, But in Church-windows stand, where pictures stood: And if his soul loathing that house of clay, Shall to another Kingdome march away, Under some Barns-floor his bones shall lye, Who Churches did, and Monuments defie: Where the rude Thrasher, with much knocking on, Shall wake him at the Resurrection. And on his Grave, since there must be no Stone, Shall stand this Epitaph; That he has none. LV. A Record in Rhythme, Being an Essay towards the Reformation of the Law, offer'd to the Consideration of the Committee appointed for that purpose. Written by some men of Law, at a time when they had little else to do.The attribution of this poem is questionable. By A. B. London, ss. Be it remembred now that formerly, To wit, last Term o'th' holy Trinity, Before the Keepers of the liberty Of England, by the full authority Of the long Parliament at Westminster, Priscilla Morecrave widow came, by her Atturney M. B. and prefers, I'th Court of Upper Bench, a bill of hers, Against one Roger Pricklove, who doth lye A prisoner in the Marshalls Custody Et cætera, and 'tis upon a plea Of trespass on the Case, Pledges there be To prosecute the suite, to wit, John Doe And Richard Roe. And the said bill also Doth follow in these very words, to wit In legal manner, London, Scilicet. Declaration. By M. B. Priscilla Morecrave Widow, doth complain Of Roger Pricklove, who doth now remain, Prisoner to th'Marshal of the Marshalsie, Of the said Keepers of the Liberty Of England, by authority and power Of Parliament, i'th' Bench superiour, Before the same Keepers themselves that be, For that (to wit) whereas the aforesaid she Priscilla Morecrave, is a person just, Honest, and faithful, one that never durst Give the least cause for to be thought unchast, But hath liv'd ever modest, and was grac't, With godly education, and demurely, Behav'd her self; and all her life most purely, Hath with the zealous and precise consorted; And free from all uncleanness was reported, Who never was amongst the well affected, Stain'd with a Crime, or in the least suspected; But with the pious people of this Nation, Hath had good fame, credit, and reputation; By which good reputation, she hath gain'd Not only love, and favour, but obtain'd A plentiful estate, by which most freely She manag'd her Affairs; And that Ralph Seely, One of the Assembly late at Westminster, A godly-Gospel-preaching-Minister, Was earnest suiter in the way of Marriage, To have her for his yoke-fellow; his carriage; And his most Saint-like loving humble speeches, Had her consent to all that he beseeches. And she agreed to give him all content, To wed him by the Act of Parliament: Three times the Contract publish't, then their trust is That all shall be compleated by the Justice: But this said Roger all aforesaid knowing, Maliciously intending her undoing, To blast her reputation, and dishonour Her unstain'd Chastity; to cast upon Her Infamous obloquy, to dis-repute Her; And to deprive her of her foresaid Suiter; By breaking of the marriage was intended; To leave her to the world lost, and unfriended; In month September, day of the same Eleven, One thousand six hundred fifty and seven, Of our Lords year, as by our computation, Our Common-wealth reckons from th'incarnation, At London in the parish of St. Mary Bow, in the ward of Cheap, he then contrary To truth most falsly and maliciously In hearing of right worthy Company, And honourable persons, Noble Lords, Did speak these false, and most reproachful words, To and off her the Plaintiff; that's to say, You are a Pockie Whore, and at this day You have three Bastards living, which do dwell, Two in Pick-hatch, and one in Clarkenwell: By reason of which false malicious speaking Of the said Roger, to her great heart-breaking; The godly Gospel-Minister, her Suiter, Forbears his former suit, and for the future, Did make profession he would never take her To be his Consort, but did quite forsake her; And all her friends with whom he had repute, Do now esteem her for a Prostitute; Whereby she is the worse, and damnifi'd, One thousand and five hundred pounds, beside; And thereupon she doth her suit produce, In th'Upper Bench, because of this abuse. Imparlance. By A. B. And now until this day, that is to say, On Munday three weeks after Michaels day In this same Term, which very day until Roger had leave t'emparl unto that Bill, And then to answer it; before the same Keepers, as well the said Priscilla came, I'th Court of Upper Bench, at Westminster By that Attourney nam'd before, for her, As the aforesaid Roger, who doth come By his Attourney A. B. And doth defend the force and injurie, When, where, et ceæera. And said that she, The said Priscilla, ought not maintain, nor Have thereupon her Suit against him, for Protesting, not acknowledging that she Is half so honest as she'ld seem to be; Nor is her body, or her life so clear, Nor so unspotted, as she would appear; Nor is she of so chaste a reputation, As is pretended by her Declaration: Protesting also that the said Ralph Seely (Though oft together did both he and she lye) Ne'r meant to Marry her, but all his power, Of love was quench'd in less then half an hour. Besides he'ld quite undo her; if he had, His learning was so small his life so bad. For Plea he saith that at the time, wherein She does suppose these slandrous words t'have bin Spoke by th'aforesaid Roger, she the said Priscilla was nor Widow, Wife, nor Maid; And though she pass'd for an unbroken Virgin, She catch'd th'aforesaid Presbyter in her gyn; And with his wall-ey'd Saintship plaid the sinner, Who b'ing inspir'd by a Thanksgiving dinner, Did carnally her body know, to wit The crime of Fornication did commit; In the same Ward, and Parish, to his Honour, He at one clap got three great Boyes upon her. All which for privacy were put to feeding At Bridewell and Pick-hatch, to learn good breeding: And she in recompence clap'd him so sore, With Anglice French-POX, it made him rore; And put his Genitals in such a pickle, That all his Parish women did article, And out him of his Benefices twain, And into Scotland made him trot again: Wherefore (as lawful 'twas) on this occasion, He spake the words laid in the Declaration. And this he Justifies, and judgement crave, If she this suit ought to maintain or have. Replication. By I. H. And she the said Priscilla doth maintain her Said Action, against all that's said to stain her; And saith this Court nor will nor can forejudge her, For ought that's pleaded by the foresaid Roger; But though by his said Plea, she's forc'd to tarry, Her suit against him, yet she ought to carry; Protesting therefore she's not such a liver, Nor of such Fame, as the said Plea doth give her Out for to be, but that she hath not vary'd One jot in life from what she hath declared: And on the said Ralphs part protesting farther, That of the Kirk he was a Godly Father; And of as pure and chaste a conversation, As any Presbyter within the Nation: And free from any lustful act committing, With her, or any other deed unfitting: For Replication saith, she was not knowing Of the said Ralph but three years last foregoing: During which time, and till the said words spoke were By the said Roger (that almost have broke her) She liv'd a Matrons life, chaste, grave, and thrifty, And came unto the Age of three and fifty; And the said Ralph all the said time, by reason Of his much preaching in and out of season; And of his fasting long, and longer praying, And from his peoples not their duties paying, In the same Ward and Parish, grew so weakly, That of his life he did despair weekly: Which weakness had so very much out-worn him, That in his bed he was not able turn him; Till that a learned Doctor of the Colledge Who of his sickness had full perfect knowledge, For gaining of his health did much exhort him, To wed an honest Matron to Comfort him: Which the said Ralph well liking, and well knowing The honour to the said Priscilla owing, And thinking that delayes might greatly worse him, With Zeal, did Court her for a wife to nurse him: And she in pity to his weak Condition, Did condescend to be his she Physician, And for their joynt desires better carrying, A day by both appointed was for marrying: But on the sudden off the same was broken By the said Roger's words aforesaid spoken; By means whereof, he the said Ralph, endure Could not the said Priscilla for a Cure, But of relief his expectations failing, And his long sickness more and more prevailing; In Month October, day thereof that first is, In the Lords year that formerly exprest is; At the said Ward, the said Ralph much in trouble, Did dye, to's loss, possess'd of living double: And left the said Priscilla to bemoan her, For that no other man would after own her; And that she truly doth reply and don't lye, She prays may be inquired by the Country. Rejoynder. By A. B. And the aforesaid Roger saith the Plea By her the said Priscilla formerly Put in and pleaded by her Replication, In the aforesaid manner, form, and fashion, And the whole matter that's contained there, Are not sufficient in the law, for her The said Priscilla, to maintain her aforesaid Suit against him, and there need be no more said: Nor by the laws of England is it fit, That he should make answer unto it; This to averr he's ready. Whereupon For want of better Replication In this behalf, he doth a judgment pray, And that she from having her action may Be barr'd, for this against him; And for The causes why he doth in Law demurr Upon that Replication, he the said Roger according to the Statute made, And in such case provided, doth declare And shew to th'Court of Upper Bench that's here, These causes following, to wit, that this Said Replication insufficient is, Negative, pregnant, and uncertain, rude, Double, wants form, and does not conclude Rightly, according to the legal way. Joyning in Demurrer. By A. B. And she the said Priscilla here doth say, That the said Plea which by reply has been Pleaded by her, and what's contain'd therein, In point of Law, good, and sufficient be, Her suit against him to maintain; And she That Plea and matter, pleaded as above, Is ready here both to maintain and prove, As this Court shall consider, and think fit, And 'cause he does not answer it, nor yet Deny the Replication any way, The said Priscilla (as before) doth pray Judgement, and dammages to be judg'd to her, For all this injury which he did do her: But 'cause this Court here not advised is Of giving judgment of the premises, A day's giv'n to both parties to appear I'th Upper Bench, before the Keepers here At Westminster, till Munday after eight Dayes of St. Hillary, for the receipt, And hearing of their Judgment upon it, For that the Court is not advis'd as yet. LVI. To the Kings most Sacred Majesty, on his miraculous and glorious return 29. May, 1660. Now our Spring-royal's come, this cursed ground, Which for twelve years with Tyrants did abound, Bears Kings again, a memorable Spring! May first brought forth, May now brings home our King; Auspicious Twenty ninth! this day of Mirth Now gives Redemption, which before gave Birth. Hark, how th'admiring people cry, and shout, See how they flock and leap for joy; the Rout, Whose Zeal and Ignorance, for many years, Devis'd those Goblins Jealousies and Fears, And fighting blindfold in those puzling Mists, Rais'd by the conjuring of their Exorcists, Wounded, and chas'd, and kill'd each other while Their Setters-on did share the prey, and smile. Now the delusion's o'r, do plainly see What once they were, what now they ought to be. T'abused Trumpet that was only taught To inspire Rebellion, now corrects its fault; Tun'd by your Fame; and with more chearful voyce, Contributes sounds, and helps us to Rejoyce: The Guns which roar'd for your best subjects bloud, Disown their cause now better understood; The Bells that for sedition long chim'd in, As if themselves too, Rebaptiz'd had been, Convert their notes ecchoing with louder peal, The harmony of Church and Common-weal: While in contiguous Bon-fires all the Nation Paint their late fears, and sport with Conflagration; 'Bout which rejoycing Neighbours friendly meet, And with fresh wood the kind devourer greet. Mean while, th'old Subjects, who so long have slept In Caves, and been miraculously kept From Rage and Famine; while the only thing That fed and cloath'd them, was the hope of King, Do all New-plume themselves to entertain Your long'd-for Majesty, and welcome Train. And (as in Job's time 'twas) those Spuricus things, Who look like Subjects, but did ne'r love Kings, Appear among your Subjects in array That's undiscernable, unless more gay. All with loud hallows pierce the smiling skies, While brandish'd Swords please and amaze our eyes. Why then should only I stand still? and bear No part of triumph in this Theatre? Though I'm not wise enough to speak t'a King What's worth his ear, nor rich enough to bring Gifts worthy his acceptance; though I do Not ride in Buff and Feathers, in the show; (Which Pomp I did industriously eschew, That Cost being more to me, than th'shew to you) Nor do I love a Souldiers garb to own, When my own Conscience tells me I am none. Yet I'll do duty too, for I've a mind Will not be idle, but will something find To bid my Sgveraign Welcome to his own Long-widow'd Realm, his Scepter, Crown &amp; Throne; And though too mean and empty it appear, If he afford a well-pleas'd Eye and Ear, His pow'r can't by my Weakness be withstood, Bee't what it will, he'll find, or make it good. Hail long-desired Soveraign! you that are Now our sole joy and hope, as once our fear! The Princely Son of a most pious Sire Whose Precepts and Example did inspire Your tender years with virtues, that become A King that's fit to rule all Christendome: Which your great Soul hath so improved since, Europe can't shew such an accomplish'd Prince: Whose whole life's so exemplary, that you Convinc'd those foes, which we could not subdue; And those that did t'your Court t'abuse you come, Converted Proselytes returned home: Such strong and sympathetick virtues lye In your great name, it cures when you're not nigh, Like Weapon-salve; If fame can reach up to This height of Cures, what will your person do? Your Subjects high'st Ambition, and their Cure, Bold Rebels terrour, you that did endure What e'r the Wit or Malice of your foes Could lay on you or yours, yet stoutly chose To suffer on, rather than to requite Their injuries, and grew Victorious by't; And by your patient suffering did subdue The Traytors fury, and the Traytors too. The great King-makers favourite, a Prince Born to a Crown, and kept for't ever since. From Open force, from all the Close designs Of all your Foes, and all our Catilines, From all th'insatiate malice of that bold Bloud-thirsty Tyrant, from his sword, and gold, Which hurt you more; and from your own false Friends, Whom he still kept in pay to serve his ends Yet you're deliver'd out of all these things, By your Protector, who's the King of Kings. No more that proud Usurper shall proclame Those partial Conquests which but brand his name, To all posterity, no more remember, His thrice auspicious third day of September; Since he fought not for victories, but paid; Nor were you conquer'd by him, but betray'd: And now your May, by love, has gotten more, Than his Septembers did, by bloud, before. Thanks to that Glory of the West, that Star, By whose conductive influence you are Brought to enjoy your own, whose em'nent worth These Islands are to small to Eccho forth: Whose courage baffled fear, whose purer soul No bribes could e'r seduce, no threats controul, But strangely cross'd the proverb, &amp; brought forth The best of Goods from th'once-pernicious North, To whose Integrity, your Kingdomes owe Their restauration, and what thence does flow, Your blest arrival; with such prudence still He manag'd these affairs, such truth, such skill, Such valour too, he led these Nations through Red Seas of Bloud, and yet ne'r wet their shoe. Blest be the Heavenly pow'rs, that hither sent That Noble Hero, as the instrument, To scourge away those Furies, and to bring To's longing subjects our long absent King. Welcome from forein Kingdoms, where you've been, Driv'n by hard-hearted Fate, and where you've seen, Strange men and manners; yet too truly known, No Land less Hospitable than your own; From those that would not, those that durst not do Right to themselves, by being kind to you; From profess'd foes, and from pretended friends, Whose feigned love promotes their cover'd Ends. “Kings treating Kings, springs not from love, but state, “Their love's to policy subordinate. From banishment, from dangers, and from want, From all those mischiefs that depend upon't, You're truly welcome, welcome to your throne, Your Crowns and Scepters, and what ere's your own, Nay to what's ours too, for we find it true, Our wealth is gotten and preserv'd by you. Welcome 't your Subjects hearts, which long did burn With strong desires to see your bless'd Return. Welcome t'your friends, welcome t'your wisest foes, Whose bought Experience tells them now, that those Riches they've got by plunder, fraud, and force, Do not increase, but make their fortunes worse, Like Robbers spoyls, just as they come, they go, And leave the wretches poor and wicked too. They see their error, and that only you Can give them pardon, and protection too. Since you're come out o'th fire, twelve years refin'd, With hardned body, and Experienc'd mind. Only that crew of Caitiffs, who have been, So long, so deeply plung'd in so great sin, That they despair of pardon, and believe, You can't have so much mercy to forgive, As they had villany t'offend, and so They to get out, the further in do go. These never were, and never will be true (What e'r they say or swear) to God or you. The scum and scorn of every sort of men; That for abilities, could scarce tell ten; And of estates proportion'd to their parts; Of mean enjoyments, and of worse deserts, Whom want made bold, and impudence supply'd Those gifts, which art and nature had deny'd; And in their practice perfect Atheists too, (For half-wit, and half-learning makes men so). These first contriv'd, and then promoted all Those troubles, which upon your Realm did fall; Inflam'd three populous Nations, that they might Get better opportunity and light To steal and plunder, and our goods might have, By robbing those, whom they pretend to save, Our new commotions new employments made, And what was our affliction grew their trade: And when they saw the plots, th'had laid, did take, Then they turn'd Gamesters, and put in their stake, Ventured their All; their Credit which was small, And next their Conscience which was none all, Put on all forms, and all Religions own, And all alike, for they were all of none: A thousand of them han't one Christian soul, No Oathes oblige them, and no Laws controul Their strong desires but pœnal ones; and those Make them not innocent, but cautelous. Crimes that are scandalous, and yield no gain, Revenge or pleasure, they perhaps refrain; But where a crime was gainful to commit, Or pleas'd their lust or malice, how they bit! This did invade the Pulpit, and the Throne, And first made them, then all that's ours, their own. Depos'd the Ministers and Magistrates, And in a godly way, seiz'd their estates; Then did the Gentry follow, and the Rich, Those neutral sinners, by omission, which Had good estates, for it was not a sin To plunder, but t'have ought worth plundring. And by religious forms, and shews and paints, They're call'd the godly party, and the Saints. By crafty artless Oratory, they Vent'ring to make Orations, preach, and pray, Drew in two silly souls, that were Caught with vain shews, drawn on by hope and fear, Poor undiscerning, all believing Elves, Fit but to be the ruine of themselves; Born to be couzen'd, trod on, and abus'd; Lov'd to be fool'd, and easily seduc'd: These beasts they make with courage fight and dye, Like Andabates, not knowing how, nor why, Till they destroy'd King, Kingdome, Church, and Laws, And sacrificed all to Molochs Cause: While those possess the fruit of all the toils Of these blind slaves, and flourish with their spoils, Plum'd with gay feathers stoln, (like Æsops Crow) They seem gay birds, but it was only show. Now publique lands and private too, they share Among themselves, whose mawes did never spare Ought they could grasp; to get the Royal lands, They in Bloud Royal bath'd their rav'nous hands. With which they shortly pampered grew, and rich, Then was their bloud infected with the itch Of Pomp, and Power, and now they must be Squires, And Knights and Lords, to please their wives desires, And Madam them. A broken tradesman now, Piec'd with Church-Lands, makes all the vulgar bow Unto his honour, and their Bonnets vail To's worship, that sold Petticoats, or Ale. In pomp, attire, and every thing they did Look like true Gentry, but the Soul, and Head, By which they were discern'd, for they were rude, With harsh and ill-bred natures still endu'd; Proud, and penurious. What Nobility Sprung in an instant, from all trades had we! Such t'other things, crept into t'other House, Whose Sires heel'd stockings, and whose Dams sold sowse. These were Protectors, but of such a crew, As people Newgate, not good men, and true: These were Lord Keepers, but of Cowes and Swine, Lord Coblers, and Lord Drawers, not of Wine. Fine Cockney-pageant Lords, and Lords Gee-hoo, Lords Butchers, and Lords Butlers, Dray-Lords too. And to transact with these was hatch'd a brood, Of Justices and Squires, nor great, nor good, Rays'd out of plunder, and of sequestration, Like Frogs of Nilus, from an inundation; A foundred Warrior, when the wars did cease, As nat'rally turn'd Justice of the Peace, And did with boldness th'office undertake, As a blinde Coach-horse does a Stallion make. These fill'd all Countreys, and in every Town Dwelt one or more to tread your Subjects down. And to compleat this Stratagem of theirs, They use Auxiliary Lecturers; Illiterate Dolts, pickt out of every Trade, Of the same metal, as Jeroboams, made, That ne'r took Orders, nor did any keep, But boldly into others Pulpits creep, And vent their Heresies, and there inspire The vulgar with Sedition, who desire Still to be cheated, and do love to be Mis-led by th'ears, with couzning Sophistrie, These sold Divinity, as Witches do In Lapland, Winds, to drive where e'r you go. The Sword no action did, so dire and fell, But that some Pulpiteers pronounc'd it, Well. With these ingredients, were the Countreys all Poyson'd, and fool'd, and aw'd, while they did call Themselves the Cities, or the Counties, and Do in their names, what they ne'r understand Or hear of. These did that old Dry-bone call Up to the Throne, (if he were call'd at all) And vow'd to live and dye with him; and then Address'd to Dick, and vow'd the same agen. And so to Rump; but these vowes were no more Then what they vow'd to Essex long before, And so perform'd; they dy'd alike with all, Yet liv'd on unconcerned in their fall: So as these Corks might swim at top, they ne'r Car'd what the liquor was, that them did bear. These taught the easie people, prone to sin, And ready to imbibe ill customes in, To betray trusts, to break an Oath, and Word, Things that th'old English Protestants abhorr'd. And lest these Kingdoms should hereafter be Took for inchanted Islands (where men see Nothing but Devils haunt, as if God and All virtuous people had forsook the land, And left it to these Monsters) these took care, To make us match and mix our bloud with their Polluted issue; and so do, as when Gods sons did take the daughters once of men. To fright men into this, they did begin To decimate them, for Orig'nal Sin. Children that were unborn, in those mad times, And unconcern'd in what they Voted crimes, If guilty of Estates, were forc'd to pay The tenth to those, who took nine parts away. The Law was made a standing pool, and grew Corrupt, for want of current; thence a crew Of monstrous Animals out daily crawl'd, Who little knew, but impudently ball'd; And made the Law the Eccho of the Sword, With such lew'd Cattel were the Benches stor'd, That made the Gown ridiculous, Now and then The Malefactors were the wiser men, Most times the honester; these did dispence, And rack the Laws, 'gainst equity and sence, Which way the Buff would have them turn; by which They long continued powerful and Rich. Now they'l all wheel about, and be for you, For (like Camælions) they still change their hue, And look like that that's next them; they will vow, Their hearts were alwaies for you, and are now. 'Tis no new Wit, 'tis in a Play we know, Who would not wish you King, now you are so? Yet you can pardon all, for you have more Mercy and love, than they have crimes, in store. And you can love, or pity them, which none But you could do; you can their persons own, And with unconquer'd patience look on them, Because your Nature knows not to condemn. You'll let them live, and by your grace convince Their treach'rous hearts, that they have wrong'd a Prince, Whom God and Angels love and keep; whose mind Solely to love and mercy is inclin'd; Whom none but such as they would hurt, or grieve, And none but such as you could e'r forgive Such men and crimes. Those feathers ne'rtheless Pluck'd from your Subjects backs, their own to dress, Should be repluck'd, or else they should restore, They'll still be left Crows, as they were before. But if you trust them, ? And now you are returned to your Realm, May you sit long, and stedfastly at th'Helm, And rule these head-strong people: may you be The true Protector of our Libertie. Your wisdome only answers th'expectation Of this long injur'd, now reviving Nation. May true Religion flourish and increase, And we love virtue, as the ground of peace; May all pretences, outward forms, and shewes Whereby we have been gull'd, give way for those True act of pure religious, and may we Not only seem religious, but be. Of taking Oathes, may you and we be shy, But being ta'ne think no necessity O power can make us break them! may we ne'r Make wilful breach of promises! nor e'r Basely betray our trusts! but strive to be Men both of honour, and of honestie! And may those only that are just, and true, Be alwaies honour'd, and imploy'd by you. Next let our sacred Laws in which do stand The wealth, the peace, and safety of our Land, be kept inviolable, and never made Nets to the small, while the great Flies evade! May those that are intrusted with them be Men of sound knowledge, and integrity, And sober courage; such as dare, and will, And can do Justice! We have felt what ill Comes by such Clarks and Judges as have been, For favour, faction, or design put in, Without respect to Merit, who have made The Law to Tyrants various lusts a Bawd, Perverted Justice, and our Rights have sold, And Rulers have been over-rul'd by Gold: Then are the people happy, and Kings too, When, they that are in power, are good, and doe. On these two Bases let our peace be built So firm and lasting, that no bloud be spilt, No Countrey wasted, and no treasure spent While you and yours do reign; no future rent Disturb your happiness; but may we strive Each in his sphere, to make this Nation thrive, Grow plentiful, and pow'rful, and become The Joy or Terror of all Christendome. And those, who lately thought themselves above us, May, spite of fate, or tremble at, or love us, May no incroaching spirit break the hedge Between Prerogative, and Priviledge. And may your sacred Majesty enjoy Delights of Mind, and Body, that ne'r cloy! Not only be obey'd, but lov'd at home, Prais'd and admir'd by all that near you come! And may your Royal Fame be spread as far As valiant, and as virtuous people are! And when you're Majesty shall be inclin'd, To bless your Realms with heirs, oh may you find A Spouse that may for Beauty, Virtue, Wit, And royal birth, be for your person fit! May you abound in hopeful heirs, that may Govern the Nations, and your Scepters sway, Till time shall be no more, and pledges be Both of your love, and our felicity. May you live long and happily, and find No pains of body, and no griefs of mind: While we with loyal hearts Rejoyce, and Sing God bless your Kingdoms, and God save our KING. THE END.</field>
