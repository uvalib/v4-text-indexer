      <field name="fulltext">JOHN GILPIN's GHOST; OR, THE WARNING VOICE OF KING CHANTICLEER. PART I. Ye men of Oakham, one and all, So valiant and so witty, Of late for treason all agog, Attend unto my ditty: A ditty which the bard I ween In pillory may rue; For it a libel must be deem'd— Since ev'ry word is true. I'll shew how Johnny Gilpin's ghost His dearest son awoke; And how that son thro' darkling air, A wond'rous journey took; And how the Lords of Oakham's town,— All men of high degree, Apothecaries, men of law, And those that 'squires be!— How these, and such like gallant men Assembled at the Crown, Lest Sans-Culottes, with pop-guns arm'd, Should beat the Sign-post down. That Sign-post which so long has stood, The wonder of each lout, Till with seditious paper balls, Tom Paine kick'd up a rout. (Since when, ah woe! ah well-a-day! How fool'scap has abounded!) And crowns, and mitres eke to boot, And sign-post Dukes confounded. Then wonder not, ye Oakham men, Nor scratch your heads to know Why those who gaudy sign-posts love Should with such fury glow. But listen to the tale I tell, Nor let a word be lost, How Lawyer Combes was lately wak'd By Johnny Gilpin's ghost. 'Twas at the solemn hour of night, When all lay still in bed;— Except the Swinish Multitude, Who grunt for want of bread— For bellies full, as Berry knows, Dispose us men to sleep, While gnawing hunger oft is found The eyes agog to keep. 'Twas at that hour, when doctors grave, And keen attornies too, Their ruin'd clients, in their dreams, And murder'd patients view, When Gilpin, in his winding sheet, At Combes's feet did stand: “Awake,” he said, “thou man of law!” And wav'd his shadowy hand. “Ah!” who art thou?” the lawyer cried, All as the spectre pale;— “Some client, sure, who gain'd his suit, “But died for costs in jail! “Or some poor famish'd wretch I ween, “Compell'd the town to flee, “Because he could not stand a suit “Against my Lord and me. “And must I issue join, so soon, “Before the courts above, “From which no writ of error I “Can ever hope to move?” “Not so, my son,” with solemn voice The spectre made reply; “No tipstaff stern, from heav'n dispatch'd “With special capias I, “Nor yet, I ween, for thee array'd “The winged jurors stand, “Nor God Almighty's Clerk in Court “Yet bids “hold up thy hand.” “But here thy loving father stands, “Thy father all so kind, “Who rode so fast through Edmonton “And left his wig behind. “That father who, one night in cups, “To loving spouse untrue, “Was led astray up Fetter-lane, “And bless'd the world with you. “From Mistress Gilpin's jealous eye “I kept thee close conceal'd; “And, pleas'd to see the thriving hopes “Thy early youth reveal'd, “I put thee to a man of law, “In hopes to make thee great; “And since, alike alive or dead, “Have watch'd thy growing state. “And now a tale I come to tell, “If ghosts can read aright, “Shall make thee dear to Billy Pitt, “And great as Joey White: “That Billy Pitt, and Joey White, “The people's joint salvation! “Who all the cash, and all the spies, “Command throughout the nation. “For, know, from London's wicked town, “To mar your bless'd condition, “A dreadful lot is on the road “Of TREASON and SEDITION!!! “All from a wicked wight it comes, “Who gives in London Lectures, “And fills the heads of common folks “With strange and new conjectures. “He tells them, common folks are men, “And should like men be treated; “Nor, like a swinish multitude, “By wealthy knaves be cheated. “He tells them, too, 'tis very hard “On them and all their neighbors, “That Lords, and Dukes, and Kings, should eat “The profit of their labors: “Or that they should be tax'd and tax'd “(Which he to prove is willing) “Till for two-pennyworth of bread “They're forc'd to pay a shilling! “Ye priests and lawyers, how your pride “Must soon come tumbling down “Should e'er these new French principles “Arrive in Oakham town! “Then haste, my son; arise, with me “To Biggleswade repair, “Ere yet my shadowy essence melt “Before the morning air.” He said, and seiz'd him in his arms, Nor for an answer stopp'd; And Lawyer Combes, by Gilpin's ghost, At Biggleswade was dropp'd. The morning breaks, the coach arrives, The lawyer pricks his ears, Ransacks the basket, boot, and seats, But not a book appears. Then did he rave and stamp, and forth A special capias draw; And swear against his father's ghost He'd bring a suit at law. While thus despairing, round he star'd, And search'd on every side, Beneath an old dame's petticoats He something strange espied. “'Tis here, 'tis here; I have it fast,” With eager joy he cried— “'Tis here, 'tis here,” the echoing walls Of Biggleswade replied. The promis'd prize, with trembling hand, He drew from its retreat; Then back return'd to Oakham town Upon a courser fleet. And all the while as he did ride, He counted on the gains, Which Oakham's sapient Gothamites Would give him for his pains. And to himself he thus did say— “I'll next to court, I vow, “And to the mighty Billy Pitt “Will make my humble bow. “Who knows but, when this feat is told, “Great Pitt may deign to smile; “And with a little sinecure “Reward my faithful toil. “Or, should the Inquisition want “Another helping hand, “Why should not Combes's humble name “With White's aspire to stand?” END OF PART FIRST.PART II. Now to the Crown with one consent All Oakham's heroes fly, Resolv'd the Sign-post to defend, Or in the conflict die: For Fame, upon the market cross, Did tell the wond'rous tale Of Lawyer Combes and Gilpin's ghost, All as the ashes pale. First, blustering Berry came, renown'd For bolus, draught, and blister, And from sedition vow'd to purge All Oakham with a clyster. Next, Williams, trembling for his tithes, His royal zeal display'd. He rose; he flew; nor even stopp'd To kiss his buxom maid. No more he pants to greenland shade And bushy brake to run, And at his fav'rite Woodcock there To point his carnal gun? That Woodcock as a partridge plump—. Tho' sland'rous laymen clatter, What priest might not at such a bird Permit his mouth to water? But now at other game he flies, With loyal zeal so warm, With maudling Haley by his side, And flagelation Orme. This goodly trinity of priests (Three persons, one in mind!) Ran to the Crown, in pious hope A Mitre there to find. And there full many a loyal wight, With motives just as pure, They also met, resolv'd to make Their loaves and fishes sure. Says Williams, “In the book 'tis said, “As all divines agree, “The Swinish Multitude must crouch “Before the pow'rs that be. “These pow'rs that be, if right I read, “Are King, Lord, Placeman, Priest, “Who by this rule are privileg'd “On others' toil to feast. “And right it is; for, should the herd “Have all their labour brings, “They'd live as well as priests themselves, “And grow as wise as kings. “Then Church and State, in wedlock join'd, “Should awe the world no more; “Nor crowns nor mitres longer swing “At every ale-house door.” He spoke; with awe the prostrate crowd Their oracle rever'd; And once, at least, in all his life, His congregation heard; For Balaam's stick was hung aloft, As once in days of yore, And open forc'd that mumbling mouth, Which never op'd before. And now, from Biggleswade return'd, Came lawyer Combes in haste, And all before their haggard eyes The fearful packet plac'd. 'Tis op'd, with many a mutter'd spell To bless the Crown from harm, And keep them all (God speed the pray'r!) From vile Sedition's charm. When lo! a feather'd hero bounc'd, A mangled sight, to view, And stretch'd his headless neck and cried “Cock—cock-a-doodle-doo!” And still he spurn'd and flapp'd his wings, And shook his spurs of steel, While trembling joints and haggard looks, The council's fears reveal. For thus prophetic flow'd the strain That pierc'd each wond'ring ear, While priests o'er tythe-pigs, fees and dues, Bequeath'd the parting tear. “Ah, well, ye servile crew, may ye “My clarion shrill bewail, “Whose scream ill-omen'd but forebodes “A more disastrous tale. “My crowing speaks the envious light “That soon must clear the sky; “For kingcraft's, priestcraft's night is past, “And Reason's dawn is nigh. “In me behold the fate to which “All tyranny must bow, “And those who've long oppress'd the poor “Shall be as I am now.” He spoke—they would have stopp'd his voice, And kept him close confin'd; But ah! he 'scap'd their anxious care, As flits impassive wind. And still he stalks abroad, the fate Of tyrants to display; Nor can the Attorney General's self The headless spectre lay.</field>
