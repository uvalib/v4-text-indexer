      <field name="fulltext">FIRST SERIES. Dedication. Good Friend Of Mine, To Me Unknown, Save For The Secret Friendship Shown, Accept, In Your Sequestered Nook, The Dedication Of My Book. A GREETING. Annie Besant, brave and dear, May some message, uttered here, Reach you, ringing golden-clear. Though we stand not side by side In the front of battle wide, Oft I think of you with pride, Fellow-soldier in the fight! Oft I see you flash by night, Fiery-hearted for the Right! You for others sow the Grain: Yours the tears of ripening rain; Theirs the smiling harvest-gain. Fellow-worker! we shall be Workers for Eternity; Such my faith. And you shall see Life's no bubble blown of breath To delude the sight till death; Whatsoe'er the Un-Seeing saith. Love that closes dying eyes, Wakes them too, in glad surprise: Love that makes for ever wise. Soulâwhilst murmuring âThere's no soulââ Shall upspring like flame from coal: Death is not Life's final goal. Bruno lives! Such Spirits come, Swords, immortal-tempered, from Fire and Forge of Martyrdom. You have Soul enough for seven; Life enough our earth to leaven, Love enough to create heaven. One of God's own faithful Few, Whilst unknowing it, are you, Annie Besant, bravely true. PREFATORY POEM. A singer sang in sleep, and, sleeping, dreamed He sang divinely, while his spirit seemed So far in Music's heaven to soar and sing, They could not follow who stood listening! For him, the soul of sweetness found a voice. For them, the Singer only âmade a noise.â Such is the difference in the uttered strain, From that fine music passing through the brain. Such sumless treasures we possess in dreams, To find at waking only mirrored gleams. No revelation of the written word Will render all the spirit saw and heard. So fresh they breathed; so faded now they look; My few poor withered flowers in a book. Gone is the glory that once gleamed from them; The Spirit of Light imprisoned in the gem! Now the winged life hath settled down in words, These seem but stuffed instead of Singing Birds. Feelings brimful of warmth as is a rose Of its June-red, have lost their perfumed glows; The heaven-revealing thoughts that star-like shone, The daily kindlings of eternal dawn, All darkened down, like Meteors that have birth In Heaven, to flash and quench them cold in earth. We grasp at diamonds visible in the dew, And open empty tear-wet hands to you! We clasp at heart the daughters of the skies, Their shadow stays with us; the substance flies. Glimpses divine will peep; pictures will pass, That leave no likeness in the Seer's glass. The Poet's best immortally will lurk In that rare motion of his soul at work. Bee-like, he brings you one gold honey-drop; But the full-swing, high on the flower-top, 'Twixt Heaven that rained itself in sweetness down, And Earthâall bloom for himâis ne'er made known. MY poem was in the making. These are your Warmth-needy nurslings, Reader! mine no more. The life I gave will no more fill my breast Than the flown birds come back to last year's nest: And if these live again, 'tis you must give The reflex thrill to them by which they live. You must make out the music from the hint Prelusive: I but tune the instrument. The glory or the gladness or the grace Must shine for me re-orient in your face. The seed, that in my life took secret root, In yours must bud, and flower, and bear you fruit. BABE CHRISTABEL. It fell upon a merry May morn, All in the prime of that sweet time When daisies whiten, woodbines climb,â The dear Babe Christabel was born: When Earth like DanaÃ« bares her charms, That for the coming God unfold, Who, in the Sunshine's shower of Gold Leaps warmly into her amorous arms; When Beauty dons her daintiest dress, And, fed with April's mellow showers, The woods laugh out all leaves and flowers That flush for very happiness; And Spider-Puck his wonder weaves O' nights: and nooks of greening gloom Grow rich with Violets that bloom In the cool dusk of dewy leaves; Green fields transfigure, like a page Of Fable to the eye of Faith; Where cowslips and primroses rathe Bring back a real Golden Age; When Rose-buds drink the fiery wine Of Dawn, with crimson stains i' the mouth, All thirstily as yearning Youth From Love's hand drinks the draught divine; When fainting hearts forget their fears, And in the poorest Life's salt cup Some rare wine runs, and Hope builds up Her rainbow over Memory's tears,â It fell upon a merry May morn, All in the prime of that sweet time When daisies whiten, woodbines climb,â The dear Babe Christabel was born. All night the Stars bright watches kept, Like Gods that look a golden calm; The Silence dropped its precious balm, And the tired world serenely slept. The birds were darkling in the nest, Or bosomed in voluptuous trees: On beds of flowers the happy breeze Had kissed its fill and sank to rest. All night beneath the Cottage eaves, A lonely light, with tremulous Arc, Surged back a space the sea of dark, And glanced among the shimmering leaves. And when the Morn with frolic zest, Unclosed the curtains of the night, There was a dearer dawn of light, A tenderer life the Mother's pressed, And she at all her suffering smiled. The Star new-kindled in the darkâ Life that had fluttered like a Larkâ Lay in her bosom a sweet Child! How she had felt it drawing down Her nesting heart more close and close,â Her rose-bud ripening to the Rose, That she should one day see full-blown! How she had throbbed with hopes and fears, And strained her inner eyes till dim, To see the expected glory swim Through the rich mist of happy tears; For it, her woman's heart drank up, And laughed at, Sorrow's darkest dole: And now Delight's most dainty soul Was crushed for her in one rich cup! And then delicious languors crept, Like nectar, on her pain's hot drouth, And feeling fingersâkissing mouthâ Being faint with joy, the Mother slept. Babe Christabel was royally born! For when the earth was flushed with flowers, And drenched with beauty in sun-showers, She came through golden gates of Morn. No chamber arras-pictured round, Where sunbeams make a gorgeous gloom, And touch its glories into bloom, And footsteps fall withouten sound, Was her Birth-place that merry May-morn; No gifts were heaped, no bells were rung, No healths were drunk, no songs were sung When dear Babe Christabel was born: But Nature on the darling smiled, And with her beauty's blessing crowned: Love brooded o'er the hallowed ground, And there were Angels with the Child. And May her kisses of love did bring; Her Birds made welcoming merriment, And all her flowers in greeting sent The secret sweetnesses of Spring. In glancing light and glimmering shade, With cheeks that touched and ripelier burned May-Roses in at the lattice yearned, A-tiptoe, and Good Morrow bade. No purple and fine linen might Be hoarded up for her sweet sake: But Mother's love will clothe and make The little wearer bravely dight! Wide worlds of worship are their eyes, Their loyal hearts are worlds of love, Who fondly clasp their cooing Dove, And read its news from Paradise. Their looks praise Godâsouls sing for glee: They think if this old world had toiled Through ages to bring forth their child, It was a glorious destiny. O happy Husband! happy Wife! The rarest blessing Heaven drops down, The sweetest blossom in Spring's crown, Starts in the furrows of your life! Ah! what a towering height ye win, Who cry, âLo, my beloved Child!â And, life on life sublimely piled, Ye touch the heavens and peep within. Look how a star of glory swims Down aching silences of space, Flushing the Darkness till its face With beating heart of light o'erbrims; So brightening came Babe Christabel, To touch the earth with fresh romance, And light a Mother's countenance With looking on her miracle. With hands so flower-like soft, and fair, She caught at life, with words as sweet As first spring violets, and feet As faÃ«ry-light as feet of air. The Father, down in Toil's mirk mine, Turns to his wealthier world above, Its radiance, and its home of love; And lights his life like sun-struck wine. The Mother moves with queenlier tread: Proud swell the globes of ripe delight Above her heart, so warm and white A pillow for the baby-head! Their natures deepen, well-like, clear, Till God's eternal stars are seen, For ever shining and serene, By eyes anointed Beauty's seer. A sense of glory all things took,â The red Rose-Heart of Dawn would blow, And Sundown's sumptuous pictures show Babe-Cherubs wearing their Babe's look! And round their peerless one they clung, Like bees about a flower's wine-cup; New thoughts and feelings blossomed up, And hearts for very fulness sung Of what their budding Babe should grow, When the Maid crimsoned into Wife, And crowned the summit of some life, To bear the morning on her brow! And they should bless her for a Bride, Who, like a splendid saint alit In some heart's seventh heaven, should sit, As now in theirs, all glorified. 'Twas thus they built their Castles brave In faÃ«ry lands of gorgeous cloud; They never saw a wee white shroud, Nor guessed how flowers will mask the grave. She grew, a sweet and sinless Child, In shine and shower,âcalm and strife; A Rainbow on our dark of Life, From Love's own radiant heaven down-smiled! In lonely loveliness she grew,â A shape all music, light, and love, With startling looks, so eloquent of The spirit whitening into view. At Childhood she could seldom play With merry heart, whose flashes rise Like splendour-wingÃ¨d butterflies From honeyed hearts of flowers in May: The fields in blossom flamed and flushed, The Roses into crimson yearned, With cloudy fire the wall-flowers burned, And blood-red Sunsets bloomed and blushed,â And still her cheek grew pale as pearl,â It took no tint of Summer's wealth Of colour, warmth, and wine of Health: Death's hand so whitely pressed the Girl! No blush grew ripe to sun or kiss Where violet veins ran purple light, So tenderly through Parian white, Touching you into tenderness. A spirit-look was in her face, That shadowed a miraculous range Of meanings, ever rich and strange, Or lightened glory in the place. Such mystic lore was in her eyes, And light of other worlds than ours, She looked as she had gathered flowers, With little maids of Paradise. And she would talk so weirdly-wild, And grow upon your wonderings, As though her stature rose on wings! And you forgot she was a Child. Ah! she was one of those who come With pledge and promise not to stay Long, ere the Angels let them stray To nestle down in earthly home: And, through the windows of her eyes, We often saw her saintly soul, Serene, and sad, and beautiful, Go sorrowing for lost Paradise! Our Lamb in mystic meadows played: In some celestial sleep she walked Her dream of life, and low we talked, As of her waking heart-afraid. In Earth she took no lusty root, Her beauty of promise to disclose, Or round into the Woman-Rose, And climb into Life's crowning fruit. She came,âas comes the light of smiles O'er earth, and every budding thing Makes quick with beautyâalive with Spring; Then goeth to the golden Isles. She cameâlike music in the night Floating as heaven in the brain, A moment oped, and shut again, And all is dark where all was light. Midnight was trancÃ¨d solemnly Thinking of dawn: Her Star-thoughts burned; The Trees like burdened Prophets yearned, Rapt in a wind of prophecy: When, like the Night, the shadow of Woe On all things laid its hand death-dark, Our last hope went out as a spark, And a cry smote heaven like a blow. We sat and watched by Life's dark stream, Our love-lamp blown about the night, With hearts that lived as lived its light, And died as died its precious gleam. In Death's face hers flashed up and smiled, As smile the young flowers in their prime, I' the face of their gray murderer Time, And Death for true love kissed our child. She thought our good-night kiss was given, And like a flower her life did close. Angels uncurtained that repose, And the next waking dawned in heaven. They snatched our little tenderling, So shyly opening into view, Delighted, as the Children do The primrose that is first in Spring. With her white hands clasped she sleepeth; heart is hushed, and lips are cold; Death shrouds up her heaven of beauty, and a weary way we go, Like the sheep without a Shepherd on the wintry norland wold, With the face of Day shut out by blinding snow. O'er its widowed nest my heart sits moaning for its youngling fled From this world of wail and weeping, gone to join her starry peers; And my light of life's o'ershadowed where the dear one lieth dead, And I'm crying in the dark with many fears. All last night-tide she seemed near me, like a lost beloved Bird, Beating at the lattice louder than the sobbing wind and rain; And I called across the night with tender name and fondling word; And I yearned out through the darkness, all in vain. Heart will plead, âEyes cannot see her: they are blind with tears of pain;â And it climbeth up and straineth for dear life to look and hark While I call her once again: but there cometh no refrain, And it droppeth down, and dieth in the dark. In this dim world of clouding cares, We rarely know, till wildered eyes See white wings lessening up the skies, The Angels with us unawares. And thou hast stolen a jewel, Death! Shall light thy dark up like a Star, A Beacon kindling from afar Our light of love, and fainting faith. Through tears it streams perpetually, And glitters through the thickest glooms, Till the eternal morning comes To light us o'er the Jasper Sea. With our best branch in tenderest leaf, We've strewn the way our Lord doth come; And, ready for the harvest-home, His Reapers bind our ripest sheaf. Our beautiful Bird of light hath fled: Awhile she sat with folded wingsâ Sang round us a few hoveringsâ Then straightway into glory sped. With sense of Motherhood new-found Some white-winged Angel nurtures her, High on the heavenly hills of myrrh, With all Love's purple glory round. Through Childhood's morning-land, serene She walked betwixt us twain, like Love; While, in a robe of light above, Her watching Angel walked unseen, Till Life's highway broke bleak and wild; Then, lest her starry garments trail In mire, heart bleed, and courage fail, The Angel's arms caught up the child. Her wave of life hath backward rolled To the great ocean; on whose shore We wander up and down, to store Some treasures of the times of old: And aye we seek and hunger on For precious pearls and relics rare, Strewn on the sands for us to wear At heart, for love of her that's gone. O weep no more! there yet is balm In Gilead; Love doth ever shed Rich healing where it nestles,âspread O'er desert pillows, some green Palm! God's ichor fills the hearts that bleed; The best fruit loads the broken bough; And in the wounds our sufferings plough, Love sows its own immortal seed. Strange glory runs down Life's cloud-rents, And through the open door of Death We see the hand that beckoneth To the beloved going hence. COUSIN WINNIE. The glad spring-green grows luminous With coming Summer's golden glow; Merry Birds sing as they sang to us In far-off seasons, long ago: The old place brings the young Dawn back, That moist eyes mirror in their dew; My heart goes forth along the track Where oft it danced, dear Winnie, with you. A world of Time, a sea of change, Have rolled between the paths we tread, Since you were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â There's where I nearly broke my neck, Climbing for nests! and hid my pain: And then I thought your heart would break, To have the Birds put back again! Yonder, with lordliest tenderness, I carried you across the Brook; So happy in my arms to press You, triumphing in your timid look: So lovingly you leaned to mine Your cheek of sweet and dusky red: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â My Being in your presence basked, And kitten-like for pleasure purred; A higher heaven I never asked Than watching, wistful as a bird, To hear that voice so rich and low; Or sun me in the rosy rise Of some soul-ripening smile, and know The thrill of opening paradise. The Boy might look too tenderly, All lightly 'twas interpreted: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â Ay me, but I remember how I felt the heart-break, bitterly, When the Well-handle smote your brow, Because the blow fell not on me! Such holy longing filled my life, I could have died, Sweet, for your sake; But never thought of you as Wife; A cure to clasp for love's heart-ache. You entered my soul's temple, Dear, Something to worship, not to wed: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â I saw you, heaven on heaven higher, Grow into stately womanhood; Your beauty kindling with the fire That swims in proud old English blood: Away from me,âa radiant Joy!â You soared; fit for a Hero's bride: While I, a Man in soul, a Boy In stature, nestled at your side! You saw not how the poor wee Love Pined dumbly, and thus doubly pled: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â And then that other voice came in! There my Life's music suddenly stopped. Silence and darkness fell between Us, and my Star from heaven dropped. I led Him by the hand to youâ He was my Friendâwhose name you bear: I had prayed for some great task to do, To prove my love. I did it, Dear! He was not jealous of poor me; Nor saw my life bleed under his tread: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â I smiled, Dear, at your happinessâ So Martyrs smile upon the spearsâ The smile of your reflected bliss Flashed from my heart's dark tarn of tears! In love, that made the suffering sweet, My blessing with the rest was givenâ âGod's softest flowers kiss her feet On Earth, and crown Her head in Heaven!â And lest the heart should leap to tell Its tale i' the eyes, I bowed the head: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â I do not blame you, Darling mine; You could not know the love that lurked To make my life so intertwine With yours, and with mute mystery worked. And, had you known, how distantly Your calm eyes would have looked it down, Darkling with all the majesty Of Midnight wearing her star-crown! Into its virgin veil of cloud, The startled dearness would have fled. You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â I stretch my hand across the years; Feel, Dear, the heart still pulses true: I have often dropped internal tears, Thinking the kindest thoughts of you. I have fought like one in iron, they said, Who through the battle followed me. I struck the blows for you, and bled Within my armour secretly. Not caring for the cheers, my heart Far into the golden time had fled: You were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â I sometimes see you in my dreams, Asking for aid I may not give: Down from your eyes the sorrow streams, And helplessly I look and grieve At arms that toss with wild heart-ache, And secrets writhing to be told: I start to hear your voice, I wakeâ There's nothing but the moaning cold! Sometimes I pillow in mine arms The darling little rosy head. You are my âCousin Winnie,â and I Am your âown little, good little Ned.â I bear the name of Hero now, And flowers at my feet are cast; I feel the crown upon my browâ So keen the thorns that hold it fast! Ay me, and I would rather wear The cooling green and luminous glow Of one you made with Cowslips, Dear, A many golden Springs ago. Your gentle fingers did not give This ache of heart, this throb of head, When you were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â Alone, unwearying, year by year, I go on laying up my love. I think God makes no promise here But it shall be fulfilled above; I think my wild weed of the waste Will one day prove a flower most sweet; My love shall bear its fruit at lastâ 'Twill all be righted when we meet; And I shall find them gathered up In pearls for youâthe tears I've shed Since you were my âCousin Winnie,â and I Was your âown little, good little Ned.â HESPER. We called her Hesper; for it seemed Our Star of Eve had on us beamed, Like Hesper, from the Heaven above, To latest life a Lamp of love. But for a little while withdrawn She heralds an Eternal Dawn, Above these mists of mortal breath, Our Hesper in the dark of death! Beyond the Shadow of the night That parted us, she lifts her light To beacon us the Homeward way, Where we shall meet again by day. The Star of Eve may set, but how It shines, the Star of Morning now, And smiles with look of love that dries All tears from our uplifted eyes! APOLOGUES. THE YOUTH AND THE ANGEL. Once on a time, when Immortals To earth came visibly down, There went a Youth with an Angel Through the gates of an Eastern Town: They passed a Dog by the roadside, Where dead and rotting it lay, And the Youth, at the sickening odour, Shuddered and turned away: He gathered his robes about him And hastily hurried thence; But nought annoyed the Angel's Clear, pure, immortal sense. By came a Lady, lip-luscious, On delicate tinkling feet: All the place grew glad with her presence; The air about her sweet; For she came in fragrance floating; Her voice most silverly rang; And the Youth, to embrace her beauty, With all his being sprang. A sweet, delightsome Lady! And yet, the Legend saith, The Angel, while he passed her, Shuddered and held his breath. SUNBEAM AND ROSE. âPretty Rosebud, are thy emerald Curtains still undrawn? Odalisque of Flowers,â Tender soul o' the fervid South! I am dainty of thy beauty, All this dewy dawn; I am fainting for the ruddy Kisses of thy mouth.â Sweetly sang the Sunbeam, With a voice made low to win; Round the Rose-heart playing, Till it touched the tenderest strings; âPretty Rose-bud, ope thy lattice, Let thy true love in.â And for Heaven down-wavering warm, She waved her leafy wings! Listen, Maidens, to my Legend of the Sunbeam and the Rose. Out she sprang, kiss-coloured, In her eyes the dews of bliss; All her beauty glowing With a blush of bridal light; Gave her balm and bloom for banquet To the Tempter's kiss; Proudly oped each chamber For a princelier delight. Soon the Snake of Sweetness, Sated, could no longer stay; And away he went, a-wooing Every flower that blows! 'Twas the reign of Roses When her Lover passed to-day: Lonely in her rifled ruin Drooped the dying Rose! Listen, Maidens, to my Legend of the Sunbeam and the Rose. LOVE-LONGING. Like a tree beside the river Of her life that runs from me, Do I lean me, murmuring ever In my love's idolatry: Lo, I reach out hands of blessing; Lo, I stretch out hands of prayer; And, with passionate caressing, Pour my life upon the air. In my ears the siren river Sings, and smiles up in my face; But for ever and for ever Runs from my embrace. Spring by Spring the branches duly Clothe themselves in tender flower; And for her sweet sake as truly All their fruit and fragrance shower: But the stream, with careless laughter, Fleets in merry beauty by, And it leaves me yearning after, Lorn to droop, and lone to die. In my ears the siren river Sings, and smiles up in my face; But for ever and for ever Runs from my embrace. I stand mazÃ¨d in the moonlight, O'er its happy face to dream; I am parchÃ¨d in the noonlight By that cool and brimming stream: I am dying by the river Of her life that runs from me, And it sparkles past me ever, With its cool felicity. In my ears the siren river Sings, and smiles up in my face; But for ever and for ever Runs from my embrace. THE NEST. I built my Nest by a pleasant stream, That glided along with a smile in its gleam, Bringing me gold that was sumless; Ah me! but the floods came drowning one day, Swept my Nest with its wealth away, And I in the world was homeless! I built my Nest in a gay green tree, And the summer of life went merrily With usâwe were Birds of a feather! But the leaves soon fell, and my pretty ones flew, And through my Nest the bitter winds blew; 'Twas bare in the wildest weather. I built my Nest under Heaven's high eaves; No rising of floods, no falling of leaves, Can mock my heart's endeavour. Waters may wash, breezes may blow, In the bosom of Rest I shall smile, I shall know My Nest is safe for ever. HUNT THE SQUIRREL. It was Atle of Vermeland In Winter used to go A-hunting up in the pine-forest, With snow-shoes, sledge, and bow. Soon his sledge with the soft fine furs Was heaped up heavily, Enough to warm old Winter with, And a wealthy man was he. When just as he was going back home, He looked up into a Tree; There sat a merry brown Squirrel, that seemed To sayââYou can't shoot me!â And he twinkled all over temptingly, To the tip of his tail a-curl! His humour was arch as the look may be Of a would-be-wooed sweet Girl, That makes the Lover follow her, follow her, All his life up-caught, A-dreaming on with sleeping wings, High in the heaven of thought. Atle he left his sledge and furs; All day his arrows rung,â The Squirrel went leaping from bough to bough,â Only himself they stung. He hunted far in the dark forest, Till died the last day-gleams; Then wearily laid him down to rest, And hunted it through his dreams. All night long the snow fell fast, And covered his snug fur-store; Long, long did he strain his eyes, But never found it more. Home came Atle of Vermeland, No Squirrel! No furs for the mart! Empty head brought empty hand; Both a very full heart. Ah, many a one hunts the Squirrel, In merry or mournful truth; Until the gathering snows of age Cover the treasures of Youth. Deeper into the forest dark The Squirrel will dance all day; 'Till eyes go blind and miss their mark, And hearts will lose their way. My Boy! if you should ever espy This Squirrel up in the tree, With a dancing devil in its eye, Just let the Squirrel be! THE GLOW-WORM. The Apes found a Glow-worm, Smiling in the night,â A little drop of radiance Tenderly alight. âHo! ho!â shivered the Apes, Grinning all together, âWe'll make a fire to warm us; 'Tis jolly cold weather.â With dry sticks and dead leaves, All the Apes came; Piled a heap and squatted round To blow it into flame! But fire would not kindle soâ Vain their wasted breath! Only they blew out the glow, And put the worm to death! Glow-worms were meant to shine,â Apes can't blow them hot, Just to warm their foolish paws, Or boil their own flesh-pot. So the world would serve the Poet, With his light of love: Probably his use may be Better known above. THE SUNKEN CITY. By day it lies hidden, and lurks beneath The ripples that laugh with light; But calmly and clearly and coldly as death It looms into shape by night, Whenâthe awful Heavens alone with me!â I look on the City that's sunk in the sea. Many a Castle I built in the air; Towers that gleamed in the sun; Spires that soared up stately and fair, Till they touched heaven, every one, Lie under the waters that mournfully Closed over the City that's sunk in the sea. Many fine houses, but never a home; Windows, and no live face! Doors set wide where no beating hearts come; No voice is heard in the place; It sleeps in the arms of Eternityâ The silent City that's sunk in the sea. There the face of a dead love lies, Embalmed in the bitterest tears; No breath on the lips! no smile in the eyes, Though you watched for years and years: And the dear drowned eyes never close from me, Looking up from the City that's sunk in the sea. Two of the bonniest birds of God That ever warmed human heart For a nest, till they fluttered their wings abroad, Lie in their chambers apartâ Dead! yet pleading most piteously In the lonesome City that's sunk in the sea. Oh, the brave Ventures there lying a wreck, Dark on the shore of the Lost! Gone down with every hope on deck, When all-sail for a glorious Coast! And the waves go sparkling splendidly Over the City that's sunk in the sea. Then I look from my City that's sunk in the sea, To that Star-Chamber overhead; And torturingly they question meâ âWhat of this world of the Dead That lies out of sight? and how will it be With the City and thee, when there's no more sea?â HOW IT SEEMS. Stars in the Midnight's blue abyss So closely shine, they seem to kiss; But, Darling, they are far apart; They close not beating heart to heart: And high in glory many a Star Glows, lighting other worlds afar, Whilst hiding in its breast the dearth And darkness of a fireless hearth. All happy to the listener seems The singer, with his gracious gleams; His music rings, his ardours glow Divinely: ah, we know, we know! For all the beauty he sheds, we see How bare his own poor life may be; He gives Ambrosia, wanting bread; Makes balm for Hearts, with ache of head. He finds the Laurel budding yet, From Love transfigured and tear-wet; They are his life-drops turned to Flowers, That make so sweet this world of ours! THE WILD-FLOWER. A vagrant Wild-Flower sown by God, Out in the waste was born; It sprang up as a Corn-flower In the golden fields of Corn: The Corn all strong and stately In its bearded bravery grewâ Gathered the gold for harvest From earth and sun and dew; And when it bowed the head,âas Wind And Shadow ran their race, Like influences from Heaven Come to Earth, for playing place,â It seemed to look down on the Flower All in a smiling scorn, âPoor thing! you grow no grain for food, Or garner,â said the Corn. The bonny Flower felt lonely, Its look grew tearful-sad; But there came a smile of sunshine And its beauty grew so glad! Ah, bonny Flower! it bloomed its best Contented with its place; A blessing fell upon it As it looked up in Heaven's face; And there they grew together Till the Reapers white-winged cameâ All their Sickles shining! All their faces were a-flame; The Corn they reaped for earthly use, But an Angel fell in love With that Wild Flower, and wore it At the Harvest-Home above! THE BIRD OF MORN. Up out of the Corn the Lark carolled in light, Like a new splendour sprung from the dark hush of Night; Green light shimmered laughing o'er forest and sod; The rich sky was full of the presence of God. A fountain of rapture he lavished around His wealth of bird-fancies in blithest of sound: All through the Morn's sun-city, sea-like his psalm, With melodious waves dashed the bright world of calm: But heavily hung the drooped ears of the Corn: Gathering gold in the dewy morn. And he sang, as on heaven's fire-grains he had fed, Till his heart's merry wine had made drunken his head. How he sang! as his honey in Life's cells ne'er dwindled, And bonfires of Joy on all Life's hills were kindled: He sang, as he felt that to singing was given The magic to build rainbow-stairways to heaven! And he could not have sung with more lusty cheer, Had all the world listened a-tiptoe to hear! All the while heavily hung the Corn, Its drowsy ears heard not the minstrel of Morn. A BIRD OF NIGHT. Sing, Birdie, concealed in your Bower, Sing, Birdie, for this is the hour, Shake round you the musical shower, Like Larks from their cloud in the Spring: The Star of the twilight is twinkling, The bicycle bells are a-tinkling, And I have a prescient inkling That Birdie is going to sing. She sings not for laud or for Lover; She sings all unseen as the Dove, or The Nightingale hid in her cover; She singsâher delight is to sing! I seek not my supper or pillow, My bosom will heave like a billow, I hang up my harp on the Willow, And listen like anything. Sing, Birdie, when days have been dreary, Sing, Birdie, when hearts are a-weary, Sing, Birdie, till spirits grow cheery, Sing, Birdie, that never takes wing! Sing, Birdie, in Spring or September, From New Year to last of December; Sing, Birdie, and never remember, That any one's listening! THE LADY OF LIGHT. Star of the Day and the Night! Star of the Dark that is dying; Star of the Dawn that is nighing, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Still with the purest in white, Still art thou Queen of the Seven; Thou hast not fallen from Heaven, Lucifer, Lady of Light! How large in thy lustre, how bright The beauty of promise thou wearest! The message of Morning thou bearest, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Aid us in putting to flight The Shadows that darken about us, Illumine within, as without, us, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Shine through the thick of our fight; Open the eyes of the sleeping; Dry up the tears of the weeping, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Purge with thy pureness our sight, Thou light of the lost ones who love us, Thou lamp of the Leader above us, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Shine with transfiguring might, Till earth shall reflect back as human Thy Likeness, Celestial Woman, Lucifer, Lady of Light! With the flame of thy radiance smite The clouds that are veiling the vision Of Woman's millennial mission, Lucifer, Lady of Light! Shine in the Depth and the Height, And show us the treasuries olden Of Wisdom, the hidden, the golden, Lucifer, Lady of Light! LITTLE PEARL. âPoor little Pearl, good little Pearl!â Sighed every kindly neighbour; It was so sad to see a girl So tender, doomed to labour. A wee bird fluttered from its nest Too soon, was that meek creature; Just fit to rest in mother's breast, The darling of fond Nature. God shield poor little ones, where all Must help to be bread-bringers! For once afoot, there's none too small To ply their tiny fingers. Poor Pearl, she had no time to play The merry game of childhood; From dawn to dark she went all day, A-wooding in the wild-wood. When others played she stole apart In pale and shadowy quiet; Too full of care was her child-heart For laughter running riot. Hard lot for such a tender life, And miserable guerdon; But, like a womanly wee wife, She bravely bore her burden. One wintry day they wanted wood, When need was at the sorest; Wee Pearl, without a bit of food Must up and to the forest. But there she sank down in the snow, All over numbed and aching; Poor little Pearl, she cried as though Her very heart was breaking. The blinding snow shut out the house From little Pearl so weary; The lonesome wind among the boughs Moaned with its warnings eerie. A Spirit-Child to wee Pearl came, With footfall light as Fairy; He took her hand, he called her name, The voice was sweet and airy. His gentle eyes filled tenderly With mystical wet brightness: âAnd would you like to come with me, And wear the robe of whiteness?â He bore her bundle to the door, Gave her a flower when going; âMy darling, I shall come once more, When the little bud is blowing.â Home very wan came little Pearl, But on her face strange glory; They only thought, âWhat ails the girl?â And laughed to hear her story. Next morn the Mother sought her child, And clasped it to her bosom; Poor little Pearl, in death she smiled, And the rose was full in blossom. THE MAIDEN MARRIAGE. She sat in her virgin bower, Half sad with fancies sweet, And wist not Love drew softly nigh, Till she nestled at his feet. âArise, arise, thou fair Maiden; And adieu, adieu, thou dear! But meet me, meet me at the Kirk, In the May-time of the year.â Up in her face of holy grace The startled splendour broke; Her smile was as a dream of heaven Fulfilled whene'er she spoke. She felt such bliss in her beauty, Such pleasure in her power To richly clothe her perfect love For a peerless marriage dower. âNow kiss me, kiss me, Mother dear; He calls me, I must go!â She went to the Kirk at tryste-time, In raiment like the snow. But he who clasped her there was Death; And he hath led her where No voice is heard, there is no breath Upon the frosty air. THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF. To love our neighbour, we are told, âEven as thyself.â That Creed I hold; But love her more, a thousand-fold! My lovely Neighbour; oft we meet In lonely lane, or crowded street; I know the music of her feet. She little thinks how, on a day, She must have missed her usual way, And walked into my heart for aye. Or how the rustle of her dress Thrills through me like a soft caress, With trembles of deliciousness. Wee woman, with her smiling mien, And soul celestially serene, She passes me, unconscious Queen! Her face most innocently good, Where shyly peeps the sweet red blood: Her form a nest of Womanhood! Like Raleighâfor her dainty tread, When ways are miryâI could spread My cloak, but, there's my heart instead. Ah, Neighbour, you will never know Why 'tis my step is quickened so; Nor what the prayer I murmur low! I see you 'mid your flowers at morn, Fresh as the rosebud newly born; I marvel, can you have a thorn? If so, 'twere sweet to lean one's breast Against it, and, the more it pressed, Sing like the Bird that sorrow hath blessed. I hear you sing! And through me Spring Doth musically ripple and ring; Little you think I'm listening! You know not, dear, how dear you be; All dearer for the secrecy: Nothing, and yet a world to me. So near, too! you could hear me sigh, Or see my case with half an eye; But must not. There are reasons why. AN APOLOGUE. It was a goodly Apple, The topmost on the Tree, That golden grew, and sweet all through, As Fruit that few could see. Soft in God's smile it glistened, A Crown that might be given, To man, if he would soar and win The Woman nighest Heaven. Ah! many sighed with longing, To see the fruitage drop, But no one climbed to gather it From off the tall tree-top! And many ran for Apples That were rolled along the sod; But this, which did but tempt toward Heaven, Was left alone for God. IN MEMORIAM. The dear ones who are worthiest of our love Below, are also worthiest above. Too lofty is his place in glory now, For hands like ours to reach and wreathe his brow: A few poor flowers we plant upon his tomb, Watered with tears to make them breathe and bloom. The gentle soul that was so long thy ward, Now hovers over thee, thine Angel-Guard: And, as thou mourn'st above his dust so dear, Thy happy Comforter draws smiling near. Look up, dear friend, our Doves of Earth but rise, Transfigured into Birds of Paradise. Apparelled richly in presence of the Gods, With crown upon his brow, the old Greek stood, And offered up his soul at Sacrifice. Even then the tidings came,ââThy son is dead.â They saw the sharp words pierce him through and through, The firm lip quiver, and the face grow white; They saw the strong man tremble to the knees: Slowly the big drops gathered in his eyes: Slowly he took the crown from off his head, And let it fall to the ground, as one who feels Heart-broke all over,âfor his pride of life Hath faded; all his strength spilled in the dust. But, when the Messenger went on to tell The exulting storyâhow the valiant youth Had lost a life to win a country's love; How bravely he had borne him in the battle; How well he fought, how gloriously he fell; The weeping Father put his war-look on, And rose up with the stature of his soulâ All his life listening at the hungry earâ Eyes burning with the splendour of quenched tearsâ His pillared chin firm-set, his brave mouth clenched In calm resolve to bear, and on his face A smile as if of Sword-light! Then he stooped, And gently took the crown up from the ground; Softly replaced it on his brow, and wore It proudly, as the visible symbol of That other awful crown which darkened down. So, when the word came that our friend was dead, We bowed beneath the burden of our loss, And could have grovelled straightway, prone in dust. But looking on the happy death he died, And thinking of the holy life he lived, And knowing he was one of those that soon Attain their starry stature, and are crown'd, We could not linger in the dust to weep, But were upborne from earth as if on wings; A sunbeam in the soul dried up the tears, In which the sorrow trembled to be gone; For his dear sake we could afford to smile. Why should we weep, when 'tis so well with him? Our loss even cannot measure his great gain! Why should we weep when death is but a mask Through which we know the face of Life beyond? Grief did but bow us at his grave to show Far more of Heaven in the landscape round! For such a vestal soul as his,âso pure, So crystal-clear, so filled with light, we looked As at some window of the other world, And almost saw the Angel smiling throughâ 'Twas but a step from out our muddy street Of earth, on to the pavement all of pearl. Why should we weep? We do not bury love; The dust of earth but claims its kindred dust; We do not drop our jewels in the grave, And have no need to seek our treasures there. We do not bury life, and cannot feel The grave-grass grow betwixt our warmth and him; Death emptieth the House, but not the Heart: That keeps its darlings safe though out of sight. Let us uplift the eyelids of the Mind, And see the living Love who dwelt awhile In that frail body, now a spirit of Light, All jubilant upon the hills of God. This gloom we feel, this mourning that we wear, Is but the Shadow of his lordlier height. Why should they weep who have another friend In death; another thread to guide them through Life's maze; another tie to draw them home; A firmer foothold in the infinite; Another kinsman on the spiritual side; Another grasp to greet them through the Void; Another face to kindle with its life The pale impersonality of God? The dearest souls, you know, must part in sleep, Though lying hand in hand, or side by side, And death is but a little longer night. A little while, and we shall wake to find The clasp unbroken by the dark, and see Our lost ones with us face to face, and feel All years of yearning summed up in a kiss. Why should we fear the Grave? It is the bed Where the Kings lay in State with Angels round, And hallowed it for evermore to us. Why should we fear the Grave? It is the way The Conquerors went, and made the very dust Grow starry with the sparkle of their splendour, And left the darkness conscious of their presence. We can look down upon the Grave now they Have plumbed it, spanned it, one foot on each side. Through their dear love who have abolished death, We may shut up our Graveyards of the heart, That looked so grim of old, and plant anew This garden of our God to smile with flowers. Why do we shrink so from Eternity? We are in Eternity from Birth, not Death! Eternity is not beyond the starsâ Some far Hereafterâit is Here, and Now! The Kingdom of Heaven is within, so near We do not see it save by spirit-sight. We shut our eyes in prayer, and we are There In thought, and Thoughts are spirit-thingsâ Realities upon the other side. In death we close our eyelids once for all To pass for ever, and seem far away. And yet the distance does not lie in death; No distance, save in dissimilitude! Death's not the only door of spirit-world, Nor visibility sole presence-sign: The Near or Far is in our depth of love And height of life: We look Without, to learn Our lost ones are beyond all human reach: We feel Within, and find them nestling near. Flow soft, ye tears, adown my Lady's face, And bathe the broken spirit with your balm, And melt the cloud about her into drops That glister with the light of Heaven's own smile. And thou, God, whisper as the tears do fall, No cloud would rise to rain but for Thy Sun! She sorroweth not as those who have no hope, Nor is her House left wholly desolate. O Grief, lie lightly on my Lady's brow: She gave her best of life in love for him! A crown of glory wears the dear bowed head That hath grown gray in noble sacrifice. Ah me, I know the heart must have its way. I know the ache of utter loneliness; The severance between those that were so near: The silence never broken by a sound We still keep listening for; the spirit's loss Of its old clinging-place, that makes our life A dead leaf drifting desolately free: The many thousand things we had to say; And on the dear still face that hushing look, As though it bade us listen and be still; As though the sweet life-music still went on, Though too far off for hearingâ(as it doth). Thrice have I wrestled and been thrown by Death, Thrice have I given my dear ones to the grave; And yet I knowâsee it in spite of tears: Say it, even while the heart breaks in the voice: These are His ways to draw us nearer Him. We climb our heavens by pathways of the cloud. He breaks the image to reveal Himself! He takes our dearest things to woo us with; Takes, for a little while, the gift He gave For ever: but to better still our best. Feeling for that which fled, our finite love Is caught up in the clasp o' the Infinite, Palpably as though God did press the hand And make the heart well up and flood the eyes With that proud overflow of fuller Heaven! O Lady, let mine be the songbird's part, That singeth after rain, and shakes the drops Down, with his thrillings from the drooping spray, And sets it softly springing nigher Heaven That 'twixt the blown-clouds smiles with gladdest blue, As with the eye of bliss that is to be. Your love-ties have but lengthened to release The shadowed soul that needed far more sun. So the fair Valisneria down the dark Beside his lover, yearneth towards the light, And lives up faster, till he springs afloat, To sun him on the surface of the stream: And now he draws up, even by the root, His Love left pining on the earth below, Lifting her to his side again, full flower; And 'tis her Heaven to die and get to him! What did we ask for him, with all our love, But just a little breath of fuller life, To float the labouring lungs? And God hath given Him Life itself; full, everlasting Life. What did we pray for? Rest, even for a night, That he might rise with Sleep's most cooling dews Refreshed, to feel the morning in his soul? And God hath given him His Eternal Rest. We could not offer freedom for one hour From that dread weight of weariness they bear Who try for years to shake Death's Shadow off: And God hath made him free for Evermore. Before me hangs his Picture on the wall, Alive still, with the loving, cordial eyes.â How tenderly their winsome lustre laughed!â The fine pale face, pathetically sweet, So thin with suffering that it seemed a soul: We feared the Angels might be kissing it Too often, and too wooingly for us: The hands, so delicate and woman-white, That day by day were gliding from our grasp, They used to make my heart ache many a time. I see another picture now. The form Ye sowed in weakness hath been raised in power; A palace of pleasure for a prison of pain. The beauty of his nature that we felt Is featured in the shape he weareth now! The same kind face, but changed and glorified; From Life's unclouded summit it turns back, And sweetly smiles at all the sorrows past, With such a look as taketh away grief: No longer pale, and there is no more pain. His face is rosed with Heaven's immortal bloom, For he hath found the land of Health at last; The One Physician who can cure all ills: And he hath eaten of the Tree of Life, And felt the Eternal Spring in brain and breast Make lusty life that lightens forth in love. Indeed, indeed, as the old Poet saith, He was a very perfect, gentle Knight! A natural Noble, by the grace of God: Affection in the dearest human form. Yet, gentle as he was, how gallantly He bore his sufferings, kept the worst from sight. Having the heroic flash of English blood. How freely would he spend his little hoard Of saved-up strength with spirit lordly and blithe, To enrich a welcome and make gladder cheer! And to the Poor he was all tender heart. The very last time that he talked with me His trouble was to know how poor folk lived Upon so small a pittance, and he sighed For life, for strength to do more than he might, And in his kingly eyes great sorrow reigned. No sighs, no weakness now, in that glad world Where yearning avails more than working here, And to desire is to accomplish good: For Wishes get them Wings of power, and range Rejoicing through illimitable life; And we shall find some Castles built in Air Stand good; are habitable after all! To me, his life is like the innocent Flower That springs up for the light and spreads for love; Breathes fragrantly in gratitude to God, And in sweet odours passes from our sight. But there's no jot of all his promise lost:â Each golden hint shall have fulfilment yetâ All that was heavenliest perfected in heaven. All the shy modesties of secret soul That breathed like violets hidden in the dusk; The folded sweetness, the unfingered bloom; The unsunned riches of his rarer self; With all the Manhood, coyly unconfessed; Are shut up softly to be saved by Him Who gave us of the Flower, but keeps the fruit. The best his life could grow on earth is given; The rest can ripen till ye meet in heaven. And, dear my Lady, little can we guess What God hath planned for those He loves so much And beckons home so early to Himself! May some full foretaste of His perfect peace Fall on you, solacing with solemn joy. Of such as he was, there be few on Earth; Of such as he is, there are many in Heaven; And Life is all the sweeter that he lived, And all he loved more sacred for his sake: And Death is all the brighter that he died, And Heaven is all the happier that he's there. So, one by one the dear old faces fade. Hands wave their far farewell while beckoning us Across the river all must pass alone. We stand at gaze upon their shining track, Until the two worlds mingle in a mist, And the two lives are molten into one; Familiar things grow phantom-like remote; Things visionary draw familiar-near; The pictures that we gaze on seem the Real Looking at us; and we the Shadows that pass. And yet 'tis sweet to feelâas underfoot, Our path slopes for the quiet place apart; Day darkens in the Valley of Death's shadeâ Our best half landed in the better life; The balance leaning to the other side; The peaceful evening comes that brings all home, And we are weaning kindly to leave go Our hold of earth; the Home-sigh of the soul Is daily deepening; and as the gloom Gathers, and things are growing all a-dusk, We know our Stars are smiling overhead, In their eternal setting high and safe Where they can look down on our passing night, Glad in the loftier lustre of a sun We may not see, with steadfast gaze of love Unfathomable as Eternity: Dear memories of Hesper gentleness That are the Phosphor hopes of coming day, And death grows radiant with our Shining Ones. Blessed are they whose treasures are in Heaven! Their grief's too rich for our poor comforting. Let us put on the robe of readiness, The golden trumpet will be sounding soon, That calls us to the gathering in the Heavens! Let us press forward to their summit of life Who have ceased to pant for breath and won their Rest, And there is no more parting, no more pain! CARMINA NUPTIALIA. The Story of all stories, sweet and old; Sweetest to Lovers the last time 'tis told. WEDDED LOVE. This little spring of life, that feeds the root Of England's greatness, giveth, underground, Bloom to the Flower, and freshness to the Fruit; Then wells and spreads, with golden ripples round, In circling glory to a sea of might, Embracing Home and Country of our love: Half-mirroring the beauty beyond sight, To take some likeness of the abode above. THE WEDDING. All Women love a Wedding! old Or youthful; Mother, Widow, or Wife: It lights with precious gleam of gold The river of poorest life: For one, the gold is far and dim; For one, a glimpse of things to be; But here it sparkles, at the brim Of full felicity! And they will cluster by the way; Crowd at this Eden-gate, with eyes That run, and pray that this Pair may Keep their new Paradise. Green is the garden, as at first; As smiling-blue the happy skies, Where float the bubble-worlds that burst, And leave us smarting eyes. They seem to think that these must clasp The jewel turned to dew or mist: The glamour they could never grasp, Though wedded lips have kissed; That this gold Apple of promise, crowned With redness on the sunny side, Will gradually grow ripe all round; That this new Lover and Bride Must reach the breathing Magic Rose Such cunning spirits hold in air, On which our fingers could not close, Even when we knew 'twas there! This nest of hopes will bring forth young Unto the brooding heart's low callâ Not merely pretty birds'-eggs, strung To hide a naked wall! So many start thus, hand-in-handâ Few only reach the blessed goal; But these shall surely see the land Hid somewhere in the soul. And delicate airs creep sweetly through Old bridal-chambers dusty and dim: Down from a far heaven warm and blue, The mellow splendours swim. The Woman's eyes grow loving wet; They dazzle with the morning ray: The Woman's longing will beget Her own dear wedding-day! In his network of wrinkles, Age May veil their virgin beauties now; Faces be furrowedâa strange page Of writing on the brow: The smiling soul cannot erase The sad life-lines it shines above; Yet, imaged in the dear old face, You see their own young love! The sleeping Beauty wakes anew Beneath the drops of tender tears; The Flower unfolds, to drink the dew, That seemÃ¨d dead for years. All hearts are as a grove of birds Spring-touched and chirruping every one; And each will set the Wedding-Words To a music of her own. Some withered remnant of old bliss Flushing on faded cheeks they bring, Telling of times when Love's young kiss Was a fire-offering; And spirits walk in white, as starts This bridal-tint that blooms anew; And so, with all their Woman-hearts, They fling Good Luck's old shoe! SERENADE. âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake, And waiting to be gracious for thy sake! All night I saw thy fairness gleam afar With fresh, pure sparkle of the Morning-Star: Awake, my Love, and be the veil withdrawn From Beauty bathÃ¨d at the springs of Dawn. âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake And waiting to be gracious for thy sake. A touch upon some silver-sounding string, As all the harps of heaven were vibrating Within me, woke me, bade me rise and say, âAwake, my Love, this is our Wedding-day.â âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake, And waiting to be gracious for thy sake. It is the tender time when turtle-doves Begin to murmur of their vernal loves: Spirits that all night nestled in the flowers Shake perfume from their wings this hour of hours. âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake, And waiting to be gracious for thy sake. Thy presence sets my cloudland round about Glowing as heaven were turning inside out: And all the mists that darkened me erewhile Are smitten into splendours at thy smile. âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake And waiting to be gracious for thy sake. To feel thee mine my faith is large enough, And yet the miracle needs continual proof! One minute satisfied, the next I pine For just one more assurance thou art mine. âAwake, sweet Love, for Heaven is awake, And waiting to be gracious for thy sake. Our great sunrise of life begins to glow, And all the buds of love are ripe to blow; And all the Birds of Bliss are gaily singing, And all the Bells of Heaven for bridal ringing.â ARGUING IN A CIRCLE. âWhen first my true Love crowned me with her smile, Methought that heaven encircled me the while! When first my true Love to mine arms was given, Ah, then methought that I encircled Heaven.â AN APRIL WEDDING. O April Wedding, Sad-smiling, shadowy-bright; The Grave at foot, and overhead The merry Bird of Light! O April Wedding, The conscious ear at times Detects the Bell that tolled the knell Among the Marriage-Chimes! O April Wedding, Thy hues together run,â Through wet eyes seen,âas Red and Green Will dazzle and grow one! O April Wedding, Where Love is crowned in tears, And on a ground of deepest gloom, Hope's brightest Bow appears! O April Wedding, Thy clouds go all in white; Those that darkliest wept are now Most glorified in light! O April Wedding, Glittering in sun and showers The very grave looks glad To-day, And dead hands offer flowers! LEAVE-TAKING. When the wings are feathered, The birds forsake their nest; So the Bride will leave her Home Leaning to her Lover's breast. The tear was in her eye, But the soul was smiling through, Brimful of sunshine As a drop of summer dew. AS THEY PASSED. Within Love's chariot, side by side, Sweetness and Strength did never ride More perfectly personified: One of the dearest Angels out Of Heaven, the Bride was, beyond doubt; And his a Manhood fit to be The mortal Mansion of some deity. All eyes, like jewels, on them hung Glowing with precious life, As at her Husband's side she clung, The nestled, new-made Wife! Glad were they in the happiness they gave, But in their own proud pleasure they were grave. EVOÃ. In the presence of Spring, our beautiful Spring, Blithe bird of the bosom! the heart will sing. A Spirit of Joy in the oldest breast Is stirring, and making it young as the rest: Quickens new life to leap in each limb, And laugh out of eyes that were wintry and dim; So the old Wine stirs in his winter gloom, And wants to waken, and climb, and bloom, As he used to do in the world outside, When the grapes grew big in their purple of pride. He would laugh in the light, he would flush in the foam; In a care-drowning wave he would rosily roam; For his blood is so mellow, so merry, so warm, Into spirit of joy it would fain transform, Rioting ruddily, ripple and play, And in human life keep holidayâ Break on the brain in a luminous spray, Tinting with heaven our earthiest clay; In a fiery chariot mount on his way, With spirit-company, lordly and gay, And pass like a soul that is lost in day. So the Spirit of Joy in the oldest breast Is stirring, and making it young as the rest; Wakes a new life to leap in each limb, And laugh out of eyes that were wintry and dim. Blithe bird of the bosom! the heart will sing In the presence of Spring, our beautiful Spring. [English John Talbot, Shakspeare's terribly brave] English John Talbot, Shakspeare's terribly brave, Great Fighter, lay in his forgotten grave. It was but yesterday they found his dust, The sheath of that old Sword long gone to rust In English earth; his burial-place recover In lands owned by a certain Lordly Lover. And, lo! a Rose had sprung from out his tomb, And climbed about the Lover's life to bloom: A peerless flower of the old Hero's stockâ The tenderest gush from that heroic rock. Not oft doth Fate vouchsafe so plain a sign, Prefiguring the lives that are to twine. All sweetness to this wedded life be given; Its root so deep in earth, its perfect flower in heaven. A WAYSIDE WHISPER. âSeven years I served for you, To Love, our lord of life, Ere he made me a Master And I won you for my wife,â So faithfully, so fondly, Through a world of doubts and fears, Seven long years, BelovÃ¨d! Seven long years. âSeven years you beaconed meâ My leading, crowning star, To climb the Mount of Manhood, As you drew me from afar: You made my gray hours golden, You glistened through my tears, Seven long years, BelovÃ¨d! Seven long years. âSometimes you shined so near meâ Wide as we dwelt apartâ I hardly sought you with my arms, You were so safe at heart! Sometimes you dwined so distant, I bowed with solemn fears; Seven long years, BelovÃ¨d! Seven long years. âI built my Arch of Triumph For you to ride through; I kept my lamps all lighted That the warring winds outblew: I worked and I waited, And I fought down my fears, Seven long years, BelovÃ¨d! Seven long years. âNow the perils are all over, And the pains all past, My fortune's wheel full-circle comes In your dear eyes at last! For such a prize the winning Most brief and poor appears, Yet, 'twas seven long years, BelovÃ¨d! Seven long years.â THE WELCOME HOME. Warm is the Welcome! 'tis our way to grasp The hand in love or greeting till it ache; But to a tender heart our love doth take The happy pair it doth so proudly clasp. And very tender in its love To-day Is every heart touched with a thought of Him Low-lying in the Cypress-shadow dim, From which we came to waft you on your way, And the still face, that looks from Ashridge towers With smile more regnant in its touching ruth, And sad hoar-frost upon the dews of youth, And Widow's weeds to mix with bridal-flowers. Through Him we lost, we have more love to give. As some fond Mother yearningly hath breathed Her life out in the new life she bequeathed, Our dearest died that this great love might live. These darling Violets eloquently mute, Are rich in sadder bloom and sweeter breath, And that pathetic sanctity of death, Because our buried joy was at their root. These Roses blush with a more vital glow Of crimsonâlike pale buds, whose tips are red, As though the flower's heart, in breaking, bledâ Because of looks so lately wan with woe. These are our Jewels! tears that purged our sight Like Euphrasy; they lay above the Dead All drear and dim; but the sad drops we shed Now live with twinkling lustres in Your light! The love that darkly wept at heart hath risen Transfigured. See its sunburst in each face! As Earth, with all her flowers, smiles embrace To Spring, rejoicing from her wintry prison. These Voices, mounting merry as Larks up-spring, But now were praying on the low, cold sod: The night is pastâthey soar in praise to God; They make the old English greeting rarely ring. We lean and look to You, thinking of Him. Warm welcome for the sake of One that's gone; Warm welcome for your own! Pass on, pass on; We wave our hands, and shout till sight grows dim: And, ere the shouts cease ringing in your ears, We drink a healthâall standingâdrink to you, While in our eyes the tears are standing too: Old tears, that wanted to be wept for years: But keep a holy hush 'mid all the noise, To match the silent music your hearts make: Pass on into your faÃ«ry heaven, and take Our gentlest blessing on your wedding joys. The dawn will rise, though golden days be set; The birds sing merrily, in spite of Death; Young hearts will love while lasts this human breath; Rainbows bridge Earth and Heaven for eyes tear-wet. Pass gaily on in glory through the gate Of your new life, beneath this Bridal-Dawn; And when from future days the veil is drawn All happy fortunes for you lie in wait! And, looking on your bliss, with proudest flush May the dear Mother's face be glorified. We, now the sound hath ceased, will stand outside Your Portalsâall hearts praying 'mid the hush. THE BONNY BRIDELAND FLOWER. In the Brideland sleeping, Nestled Beauty's Flower; Came the Lover peeping Into her green bower; On her face hung tender As a drop of dew; With her virgin splendour Thrilling through and through. Now, the shy, sweet maiden Softly droops her head: All her heart is laden With his coming tread! Now the new dawn breaketh In a blush of bliss; The BelovÃ¨d waketh At her Troth-love's kiss. In our dull gray weather We have seen her bloom; Fain as Exiles gather Round some flower from Home; Seen the face that never Fades away, but gleams, With its still smile, ever Through the land of Dreams. Fair befall the bonny, Bonny Brideland flower! All things dear and sunny Bless her bridal bower! Truest love e'er given Feed her new life-root; And thou God in heaven, Crown the flower with fruit. A LOVER'S SONG. âOne so fairânone so fair. In her eyes so true Love's most inner Heaven bare To the balmiest blue! âOne so fairânone so fair. In the skies no Star Like my Star of Earth so nearâ They but shine afar. âOne so fairânone so fair. All too sweet it seems: Wake me not, O world of care, If I walk in dreams. âOne so fairânone so fair. O my bosom-guest, Love ne'er smiled a happier pair To the bridal-nest. âOne so fairânone so fair. Lean to me, sweet Wife: Light will be the load we bear: Two hearts in one life.â THE MARRIED LIFE. O happy love of weans and Wife, Ye make a man's heart dance; Kindle the desert face of life With colours of romance: A Land of Promise sparkles where Your rosier light hath shone; Too distant to attain, but near Enough to tempt us on. 'Tis here that Heaven striketh root To give the Immortal birth, Man tastes the unforbidden fruit That deifies on earth. All ye that such a Garden own, Of wingÃ¨d thieves beware, And trifles, light as thistle-down, That sow the seeds of care. Only in singleness of heart, Ye keep the heaven ye win! When Wife and Husband pull apart The Serpent glideth in. VIA CRUCIS VIA LUCIS. Spite of the Mask Eternal Love doth wear At times, that makes us shrink from it in fear, Because the Father's face we cannot find, Nor feel the presence of His love behind, Nature at heart is very pitiful. How gentle is the hand doth kindly pull The coverlet of flowers o'er the face Of Death, and light up his dark dwelling-place! With fingers and with foot-fall soft and low She comes to make the quiet mosses grow: Safe-smiling, draws the Snowdrop through the snow. Busy in sun and rain, she strives to heal, Doing her best to comfort or conceal: With tenderest grass makes green the saddest grave, And over death her flags of life will wave. She is the Angel, waiting by the prison, That saith, âHe is not here, he is arisen,â When lorn in soul we seek the face we knew, And dream of buried sweetness coming through The earth in spring-time, every flower a smile Of that dear Presence we have lost awhile. Thus, on our old Crimean battle-ground, A poor, unknown, dead Soldier's bones were foundâ (Known with those noble Englishmen of ours!) When the next May came with her sweet Wild Flowers, Nestled they lay above-ground in a grave Of tall, plumed grass, funereally a-wave In the West wind that breathed of Home: and tender There rose from earth a dawn of such spring-splendour, As if the heavens were breaking through the tomb: The Wild Flowers had so buried them in bloom. And, if we lift our eyes up from the ground, We see how surely life is compassed round With the Divine, that doth so kindly bound The pitiless blaze of fires that soon would scorch To ashes and put out our tiny torch Of being; veil the vastness of the Whole, As with drooped eyelids for the naked soul. The silent Ministers of Healing crowd About the broken heart and spirit bowed, To stay the bleeding with immortal balm, And still the cries with lips of blessÃ¨d calm; Out of the old death make the new life spring, Our earthly-buried hopes take heavenward wing; And to each blinding tear that dimmed our sight, They give a starrier self; a Spirit of Light. No matter in what separate lives we range, We feel a rootage deeper than all change. We know the roses flower to fade: We know The roses also fade again to blow. Death is Life's Shadow! Mute the music looks, And dark and dead when shadowed forth in books: Do but interpret it, all heaven will roll The Life of Music through the echoing soul. So we grow friends, familiar friends, with Death; Can look up in his face with firmer faith, To see the frowning brows shade tender eyes, Like sunny openings into Paradise. Through all the gloom and stillness of distress, With life all muffled up in silentness, We voyage onâice-locked, snow-blind, frost-boundâ Like Sailors with the Arctic winter round, Who thought they stranded in the dark, and found The solid water all one floating ground; And drifted through the night, divinely drawn, Out to the open sea, where daylight shone. The Shadow of Death is changed into the Dawn, That radiant Angel of Eternity! The mourners look up from the grave to see The dark, that bowed them by its awfulness, Fell from the Father's hands, spread out to bless. So, in His own good season, God hath given This beautiful Joy-Bringer from His Heaven, To bear His benediction from above, And be the smiling Presence of His love! Though heaviness endureth for a night, Joy cometh with the morning. Lo! the Light. Gone is the winter from our spirit-clime; This is the herald of our golden time. In all the beauty of promise, Spring is hereâ Our Springâthat will be with us all the year. O, beautiful Joy-Bringer! everywhere Happiness smiles around you, like an air Of glory, which you dwell inâStarrily-fair! The lives that have in mourning darkling lain Now gather colour; sun them once again. The tender shine that cometh after rain Illumes the eyes of old heart-ache: the pain Of loss transmuted to all-golden gain. Just now we are in the shadow of great change, And faces darken, and old things grow strange; And from the new Unknown a many shrink. Our world is getting tilted, Sages think. âThe wine of life is drawn, and the mere leesâ All that is left us. Shame on fears like these! Whate'er Eclipse may come, storm-signals threat, We are English yet, my friends, true English yet. We are standing in the shadow of some sublime Wide-wingÃ¨d Angel of the coming time. No need to wring our own hands. Let us clasp Each other's strongly with a manlier grasp. No fear the pillars of the house will fall Because we brush our cobwebs from the wall. Exultingly, O storm-winds, rise and roll All misty blight from off the stagnant soul, And lift its trailing wing to winnow through The cloudy heaven, and bare it to the blue. As in the very heart of Hope we'll ride, Borne on the ninth wave of our triumph's tide, That with its new life heaves Old England's breast, To lift the lowly, succour the oppressed; Only be loyal to the Loftiest. Arise and crown old sanctities anew, By nobler conquest make your lordship true; Awake the spirit in our English blood, That slowly brightens to the fervid flood, And does not flash till the leap comes that shows Power all the lustier for its long repose. And if the proudest Nobles have to bow, Then let it be as Rowers bend to row A sturdier stroke; and faint not, though ye know Not under what dark arch we have to go: But win the nod of an approving soul, Even though ye never reach your chosen goal. O! young hearts, dancing to the rise and fall Of life's most winsome tune at festival, Looking on your new world wherein ye move With all the large, sweet wonder of young love, The moments thronging with the life of years; Crowded with happiness and quick to tears; New smiles of greeting in each minute's face; New worlds of pleasure brimming every space; This is no winter-withered earth to you. Love comes, and life is deified anew! And hearts grow larger than their fortunes are. The horizon lifts around, sublime and far, With god-like breathing-spaceâan ample scope For loftier life, and glorious ground for hope. Turn, happy Lovers, turn on those below A little of the light in which ye glow; A little of your sunshine round you shed, And make our old world blossom where ye tread. Bring back a little seed from Eden-bowers To sow our fallows with immortal flowers. Ah! Nobles, what a chance is yours to be The founders of a lordlier Chivalry! And, with the proud old fire this people lead. When they were weak, I threatened; now I plead, Give eyes to their blind strength, for great the need. The Word of Life is well-nigh preached to death; The Flower of all sweetness withereth, Crushed in the grip of many that handle it, As though they thought Life would but yield its sweet In giving up the breath; shut the live flower In a dead Book, and kill it every hour By reason of their clasp: We want the Book Translated into life, not the mere look Of Life embalmed and shrouded in the Book. We want the life indeed, quick in the lives Of Fathers, Mothers, Children, Husbands, Wives. We need the life itselfâlived in the Home On Week-days, ere, the Sabbath-rest will come To many a homeless hungerer for home. We pray âThy Kingdom Come.â But not by prayer Can it be ever built of breath in air. In life through labour, must be brought to birth The Kingdom; as it is in heaven, on Earth. The light that left Heaven centuries ago Hath not yet reached dark myriads here below: Your lives should be the lamp that bears this light, Still burning, as the stars through all the night. Because ye are looked up to, they would mark Your shining! O, the spirits lying dark To-day, as jewels waiting but the spark Of splendour that to Love's dear smile is given, To brighten with the best that brighten Heaven! Look down, you Shining Ones, look kindly down, And save them, set as jewels in your crown. How beautiful upon the mountain height, The feet of them that bring the Lowly lightâ O'ershadowing, on wings of gentle Love, The faults and failings that they soar above! How beautiful the face of those whose smile Doth make rare sunshine in the heart of Toil; In low, sick rooms a presence as of Health; The true Rich folk, in whom the Poor have wealth! A beautiful life begets itself anew In other lives, as perfume stealing through The sense creates the flower to live again; Its spirit re-embodied in the brain. Heartfull of shining love and singing hopes, Come down where life, blind-folded, gnome-like gropes. We house the Poor to lie and die. But give Them room to stand in; house the Poor to live; A little touch of clasping hands might prove Mightiest of all the languages of Love. Give them a glimpse of kindlier, sweeter grace, And be the model of a nobler raceâ The living Poem that we may not write; The Picture that we cannot paint to sight; The Music that we dream but do not get; The Statue marble never mirrored yet. Now while the Thrush upon the barest bough Stands piping high in azure, telling how The Spring-wind wanders where the Children go A-violeting by the warm hedge-row; Daily more rich the Sallow-palms unfold And change their silver-gray for sunny gold; âGood-bye, Old Winter,â the blue heavens laugh; âThe flowers shall write you a kindly epitaph,â Far on a sea of Light the twinkling Lark Is launched, and floating like a heaven-bound bark, In which some happy spirit sails and sings, And stirs us in a dream of waking wings, With homeward yearnings, heavenward flutterings, As all about the inner life there plays A breath of bliss from out old innocent days,â Now, while the Spring mounts somewhere up the blue, We bring our firstling flowers to offer you! Violets, dim and tender; glad Primroses, That promise, ere the happy prospect closes, Ye, hand in hand, through rosier days shall tread Green earth, with richer glories garlanded; Where the wild Hyacinths, all a-dreaming, lean, In peeps of deep sea-azure through the green; And Summer sets that Golden Age of hers A-bloom, in mellow miles of yellow Furze; While, smiling down the distance, Autumn stands, The ripened fruitage glowing in his hands. And, if among the flowers some few appear Sacred to woe, and leaning with the tear Still in the eyes, I did but seek the leaf Of Healingâgather Heartsease for the grief: Nor are they tears, but rather drops of dew From heaven, that hidden Love is looking through. As, after death, our Lost Ones grow our Dearest, So, after death, our Lost Ones come the nearest: They are not lost in distant worlds above; They are our nearest link in God's own loveâ The human hand-clasps of the Infinite, That life to life, spirit to spirit knit! They fill the rift they made, like veins of gold In fire-rent fissures torture-torn of old; With sweetness store the empty place they left, As of wild honey in the rock's bare cleft. In hidden ways they aid this life of ours, As Sunshine lends a finger to the flowers, Shadowed and shrouded in the Wood's dim heart, To climb by while they push their grave apart. They think of us at Sea, who are safe on Shore; Light up the cloudy coast we struggle for! The ancient terror of Eternityâ The dark destroyer, crouching in Life's sea To wreck usâis thus Beaconed, and doth stand As our Deliverer, with a lamp in hand. We would not put them from us when we are sad; We will not shut them from us when we are glad; Nor thrust our Angel from the Marriage Feast, Although he comes, not clothÃ¨d like the rest In visible garment of a Wedding-Guest. Now pray we. Lord of Life, look smiling down Upon this Pair; with choicest blessings crown Their love; the beauty of the Flower bring Back to the bud again in some new spring! Long may they walk the blessÃ¨d life together With wedded hearts that still make golden weather, And keep the chill of winter far aloof With inward warmth when snow is on the roof; Wed in that sweet for-ever of Love's kiss, Like two rich notes made one in bridal bliss. We would not pray that sorrow ne'er may shed Her dews along the pathway they must tread: The sweetest flowers would never bloom at all If no least rain of tears did ever fall. In joy the soul is bearing human fruit; In grief it may be taking divine root. Come joy or grief, nestle them near to Thee In happy love twin for eternity! They take our Darling's place; long may they be As glad and beautiful a hope as he Hath left a bright and blessÃ¨d memory: Their day fulfil the promise of his dawnâ That, as with Thee, he may with us live on. ANCIENT EGYPT. Egypt! how I have dwelt with you in dreams, So long, so intimately, that it seems As if you had borne me; though I could not know, It was so many thousand years ago! And in my gropings darkly underground The long-lost memory at last is found Of Motherhoodâyou Mother of us all! And to my fellow-men I must recall The memory too; that common Motherhood May help to make the common brotherhood. Egypt! it lies there in the far-off past, Opening with depths profound and growths as vast As the great valley of YosemitÃ©; The birthplace out of darkness into day; The shaping matrix of the human mind; The Cradle and the Nursery of our kind. This was the land created from the flood, The land of Atum, made of the red mud, Where Num sat in his Teba throned on high, And saw the deluge once a year go by, Each brimming with the blessing that it brought, And by that water-way, in Egypt's thought, The Gods descended; but they never hurled A Deluge that should desolate the world. There the vast Hewers of the early time Built, as if that way they would surely climb The heavens; and left their labours without nameâ Colossal as their carelessness of fameâ Sole likeness of themselvesâthat heavenward For ever look with statuesque regard, As if some Vision of the Eternal grown Petrific, was for ever fixed in stone! They watched the Moon re-orb, the Stars go round, And drew the Circle; Thought's primordial bound. The Heavens looked into them with living eyes, To kindle starry thoughts in other skies, For us reflected in the image-scroll That night by night the stars for aye unroll. The Royal Heads of Language bow them down To lay in Egypt's lap each borrowed crown. The light of Asia was of Afric born; Africa, dusky Mother of the Morn; She bore the Babe-Messiah meek and mild, The Good Lord Horus, the Eternal child: The unhistoric Saviour,âhence divineâ Buddha in India; Christ in Palestine! The glory of Greece was but the After-glow Of her forgotten greatness lying low. Her Hieroglyphics buried dark as night, Or coal-deposits filled with future light, Are mines of meaning; by their light we see Through many an overshadowing mystery. The nursing Nile is living Egypt still, And as her lowlands with its freshness fill, And heave with double-breasted bounteousness, So doth the old Hidden Source of Wisdom bless The nations; secretly she brought to birth, And Egypt yet enriches all the earth. EGYPTIAN ELYSIUM. Who ploughed and sowed as Mortals, and their furrows straightly drew, They are Gods that reap, says Horus, in the Aah-en-Ru. The bark of Khepr bears us, with the good fruits that we grew; Let them sweat who have to tow it to the Aah-en-Ru! The Gods at rest are hailing the endeavours of our Crew, As the Solar Bark goes sailing for the Aah-en-Ru. Strike the Ap-Ap monster breathless; break his bones, in pieces hew The coils he rings them with who voyage to the Aah-en-Ru! We can never die again; we shall soar as spirits do; No more turning into Reptiles in the Aah-en-Ru. We shall make our Transformations, and in linen pure of hue, We shall work in white for ever in the Aah-en-Ru. We shall find the old lost faces and the nestling young that flew Like Hawks divine, gold-feathered, to the Aah-en-Ru. We shall see the good Osiris and his son the Word-made-True, Who died and roseâthe Karest!âin the Aah-en-Ru.â He who daily dies to save us, passing Earth and Hades through; Lays his life down for a pathway to the Aah-en-Ru. Lo! the Cross of life uplifted in the region of Tattu, With its arms outstretched for welcome to the Aah-en-Ru! We shall follow in the Gateways that our God hath travelled through: He will meet us, he will greet us, in the Aah-en-Ru. Here we talk of all the glory that each morning doth renew, We shall share it, we shall wear it, in the Aah-en-Ru. Here we filled the Eye of Horus, here we fed the Eye of Shu, To be luminous for ever in the Aah-en-Ru. THE KRONIAN GODS. Aye keeping their eternal track, The Deities of old Went to and fro, and there and back, In boats of starry gold. For ever true, they cycled round The Heavens, sink or climb; To boundless dark a radiant bound, And, to the timeless, Time: Till mortals looking forth in death Across the deluge dark, Besought the Gods to save their breath In Light's Celestial Ark. To the revolving Stars they prayed, While sinking back to Earth; âIn passing through the world of Shade, Oh, give us thy re-birth!â And ever a Sun beyond the Sun Quickened the human root With longings after life, that run And spring with heavenward shoot. Their yearnings kindled such a light Within them, so divine, That Death encompassed them with night, To show the starrier shine. PROTOPLASM. (PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS LOQUITUR.) The marvel of it is that when you have Your Protoplasm perfect, Life is there Already with its spontaneities, Its secret primal powers all at work; Currents of force unfollowably swift; Unceasing gleams of glory ungraspable; Pulses of pleasure and sharp stings of pain; Flashes of lightning fastened up in knots, And passion-fires bound down in prison cells. All's there, when we can say 'tis Protoplasm. Lymph, serum, semen, blood, or nettle-juice, Are worlds of life, and glassy seas of life, That heave with life, and spawn and swarm with life; A universe of life that lurks behind The infinitely little as the large; Life-giving and life-taking; fierce with life As though the hive of life rushed forth on wings, Or some life-furnace shed its fire in sparks; Moving to harmonies unutterable Through the surrounding dark, and beautiful As planetary wheelings in the heavens. Nor can you have your Matter unmixed with Mind; The Consciousness it comes from, with the intent That is fulfilled in Consciousness to be! For there's no particle of Protoplasm Panting with life, like a bird newly caught, As with a heart-beat out of the Unseen, But comes with all its secret orders sealed Within it, safe as crumpled fronds of fern, To be unfolded in due season; all Potentialities of tendency, Initial forces of diversity And modes of motion which are forms of thought; Likings, dislikings, all are there at work When we can say life is in Protoplasm. And that's creation seen; caught in the act, Although the Actor be invisible. 'Tis no use thrusting in the earth one's head To be annihilated from behind. Here is the fact that must be faced in front. 'Tis no use varnishing the face of things Merely to see one's own reflected there! This Matter of life will not make Life itself, No more than Matter of thought will make the Thinker. We have more Matter of thought than Shakspeare had, But no more Shakspeares in our mental world. Life is the unfathomable miracle That mocks us mutely, while we prate of Law, At just that distance from the surface where Its features loom the largest as it lurks. Form is but fossil: life's the running spring. We see the rhythmic thrills that come and go, But Life itself is always just beyondâ Is not precipitated, as the pearl, Within our grasp, however deep we dive. 'Tis like the first star in the twilight heaven You lie in wait for, never see it coming, Catch the first twinkle; suddenly 'tis there, As though it watched you while you winked, and was There, had been, busy, from eternity. In vain you look for life beginning; 'tis But known to us in its becoming! 'tis Illimitable continuity! In vain you try to untwist it to the end That snaps off like the Periwinkle's tail. We feel through all the universe to touch The physical, and find it all alike, Here underfoot the same as overhead, Dust of the earth or glory of the star, The Matter yields no closer clasp of Life. We build our Babels higher than of old Firmer, but get no nearer Heaven that way: On the outside of things we stand to rear Our scaffolding, while Life works from within. Life haunts me like a Ghost that's never laid, Yet wavering ever as a face in water. I shift my ground, I quit my premises, I seek an undisturbed abiding-place, As the poor Peasant left his haunted house To flee from its old ghostly visitant For peace of mind; and mid-way on the road To his new dwelling heard the Ghost's wee voice, From out the middle of a feather-bed, Or God knows where, cry, âAnd I'm flitting too!â No sooner do I set my world on wheels, Atom revolving round its fellow mite, The universe in little grasped by Law, Than there's a living face within the wheels, As in the Prophet's vision. I'm no prophet, And had no wish to see a spirit; wheels Were made to run and carry, not to dazzle And dizzy us until our eyes strike spiritsâ That puts a new face on the matter, or The Soul of things must make a face at me! I get a good grip-hold of things themselves, And then am lost in their relationships. No sooner have I pitched my tent in Matter, And feel it firm to rest on, palpable, Tangible as a tombstone underfoot, Than 'tis a sieve that lets the quick life through; There is a general rising from the Dead, And rending of the veil; the grave's astir As though each atom were the womb of Life; Twixt each two atoms there's a gulf of God; My atom is afloat, adrift with me; It rocks and quakes like any modern throne; No anchorage in all Immensity! O'erhead I draw the cloud of darkness round About me, proof against the common light, When lo! the gloom begins to laugh at me; The life breaks in and out, darts through and through, Like Lightning playing at hide-and-seek with me; Darkness is freaked and shattered with that laugh Zig-zagged upon the face of the Unknown. This light within, that will break through the seen, Cannot be phosphorescence from the dead And luminosity of mere decay, A corpse-light of the Grave, or else the Soul Of all were but a gleam through a dead skull, Lit up to show the eyeless emptiness, And Death would be sole quickener of Life. 'Tis in the shadow of the Sepulchre Perchance I sit to watch and wait in vain For that which must arise within myself To lighten through me and illuminate My seeing; touch mine ear to hear the voiceâ âI am the resurrection and the life; Presence that lives in light and looks through form;â And he who hides without must bring to light The meaning by his presence in the soul. Perchance God speaks to us in parable, And Matter is but symbol used by Mind, The visible show that needs interpreting By second-sight to read the eternal thought; And I am as a blind man, one who feels The letters raised, shaped to the sense of touch, But have not learned to read what they reveal, So miss the letter-link from soul to soul. He breathed the breath of life and man became A living soulâwith power to propagate The spark His breath yet kindles into soul? And is He breathing yet, as at the first, This breath of life through all things? Is his breath Our motionâwave of the Eternal Will In Evolution welling, warm with love? Are laws that fold us arms of His embrace? And is life visible breathing of His being? Matter but so much breath made visibleâ The cloud-mask shifting on the Protean face; And is it need of Him that makes us breathe? And so we live and have our life in Him Who is the life indeed for evermore; The heart of Life whose throbs are visible worlds Of men and women and immortal souls? So the voice murmurs when I shut my eyes And lean and listen on some crumbling verge, And hear the waters in the well of life Sing, as they bubble with an eye to heaven, And might know more could I but drink, but have Nothing to draw with, and the well's so deep! A POET'S LOVE-LETTER. You ask me, Friend, to tell you of my Wife! And on what stair or landing-place of life I met, as 'twere, God's Angel coming down, Or mine ascending, for her marriage crown. I say you sooth, however strange it seem, The first time that I saw her was in dream: A vision of the night did clearly glass Her living lineaments. I saw her pass Smiling, as those may smile who feel they hold At heart safe-hidden, secret fold on fold, The sweetest love that ever was untold. And as it went the Vision flashed on me A moment's look; a lifetime's memory. But little could I dream that this should prove The whole wide world's one lady of my love. I had never seen that face or form, and yet I knew them both by daylight when we met. Blind World! to pass, and pass my darling by, My lily of the vale, where she did lie Sheathed in her own green leaves, and never see The flower hid-in-waiting there for me, With cloudy fragrance all about her curled; And yet my blessings on thee, O blind World! It is so sweet to find with one's own eyes, Led by divine good-hap, to her surprise, Our Perdita, our Princess in disguise! The eye that finds must bring the power to see; (Says GoÃ«the's doctrine, comforting to me!) And now she's found, the world would give me much Could I but tell it of another such. Is she an Angel? Let us not forget, My friend, that we are scarcely Angels yet. At least my modest soul would not be pledged To call itself an Angel fully fledged: Flesh is so frail, nor am I very sure Of being, in spirit, altogether pure! Snags of old broken sins torment me still With pains that Death itself will hardly kill. If not an Angel, let the truth be told, I have not grasped the glitterâmissed the Gold. And lucky is the man who gets the gold, Refined and fitted for the marriage mould! Still happier who can keep it pure to bear The final features of immortal wear. She is of Angel-stuff; but I'm afraid The Angels are not given us ready-made: In other worlds, this Wife of mine may be The perfect public Angel all may see; At present she's a private one for meâ My household deity of Common Things, That into lowly ways a beauty brings, Just as the grass comes creeping, making bright And blessÃ¨d, with its ripples of delight And quiet smiles, all pathways dim and bare. Is she a Beauty? Well, I will not swear A thousand beauties with her beauty blend; A thousand graces on her Grace attend; Or that she is so pitilessly fair Each passer-by must turn, or stop, or stare, And he on whom she looks feels instantly As one that springs from dust to deity. Nor can I sing of outer symbols nowâ The swan-white stately neck; the snow-white brow; The lip's live rose; the head superbly crowned; Eyes, that when fathomed, farthest heaven is found! I chose for worth, not show, nor chose for them Who want the casket richer than the gem. That Wife is poor, whate'er her dower may be, Who hath no beauty save what all may see: No mystery of the human and divine; No other face to unveil within the shrine, Up-lighted only for one worshipper, And to one love alone familiar: No veil to lift from her familiar face Daily, and show the unfamiliar grace. Eyes shine for others, but divinely dim And dewy do they grow alone for him! And her dear face transfigured he doth find All mirror to the marvel in his mind! The beauty worn by Bird and Butterfly Lives on the outside, lustrous to the eye: But still as nobler grow hue, form, and face, More inward is shy Beauty's dwelling-place. And there's a beauty fashioned in the mould Transmitted from the Beautiful of old, That from some family-face its best doth win: But my love's dawneth daily from within; The loveliness of love made visible, To feature which the sculptor Form is dull: Not the mere charms of cheek, or chin, or lip, That vanish on a week's acquaintanceship; But that crown-beauty which we cannot clasp, The beauty that eludes Death's own grave-grasp. At forty, what we seek for in a Wife Is a calm haven amid seas of strife: One fresh green summit in the waste of life, That gathers dew of heaven and tenderly Turns it to healing drops for you or me; A spring of freshness in the desert sand; A palm for shadow in a weary land; A being that doth not dwell so far apart That we can find no entrance save at heart; One that at equal step with us may walk, And kiss at equal stature in our talk; To scale the loftiest life, still arm-in-arm, As well as nestle in the valleys warm. And here's my Rest, where sheen and shadow meet O'erhead, the small flowers budding at my feet; Green picnic places peeping from the wood, Where you may meet the spirit of Robin Hood Crossing the moonlight at the old deer-chase; A brooding Dove the Spirit of the place; Gleams of the Graces at their bath of dew; An earthly pleasaunce; heaven trembling through; My Darling sitting with her hand in mine, Here, where amid lush grass the large-eyed kine Ruminant, stolid, statelily behold The milky plenty and the mellowing gold: And with glad laugh the tiny buttercup Its beaker of delight brimful holds up; And prodigally glorified, the mead Is all aglow with red-ripe sorrel-seed, And quick with smells that make one long to be A-gathering sweets, bloom-buried utterly. The sylvan world's old royalties around With all their Summer beauty newly crowned: Broad beeches, that have caught alive the swirl O' the wind-waveâshaped it in their branches' curl; Proud oaks, from head to foot all feudal yet; And whispering pines, that have in worship met,â Their delicate Gothic sharp against the shine Of sunset heaven's honeyed hyalineâ Black-plumed and hushed as though they were the Hearse Of day's departed glory, are those Firs When Venus, glowing in the lift above, Laughs down on lovers with the eye of Love, And such a pulse of pleasure as is given To those who reach the promise of her heaven, Luminous in her loveliness, as though The Goddess' self were coming from the glow. I brought my Love here happy months ago, Her winter prison, amid miles of snow. Poor bird! she felt that she was caged at last, Her forest far away, its freedom past: Her eyes made mournful search, mine laughed to see, She would have flown, and knew not where to flee. The little wedding-ring had grown a round Large hoop about our lives, and we were bound! Useless was all petitionary quest, No outlet!âso she nestled in my breast; And may we always be as wise, my dear, When things look dark around, or foes are near. Peep in at window now and you may see Her leading captive my captivity: Contented with her prison, polishing The grating round her in a shining ring. And now the fragrant summer-tide hath come And isled us in a sea of leaf and bloom. And now the tremulous sweetness, restless grace, Have settled down to brood in her dear face That lightens by me, fair and privet-pale, Soft in the shadow of the bridal-veil: The sunny sparkle of Southern radiance That in her English blood doth bicker and dance, Hath steadied to the still and sacred glow Which hath more inner life than outer show. So many are the mishaps and the griefs In marriage, like Beau Brummel's Neckerchiefs; Armfuls of failure for one perfect tie! And have we hit it, do you say or sigh? Time was when life in triumph would have run, And faster than the fields catch fire o' the sun, Or light takes form and feature in the flowers, My answer would have blossomed with the hours I should have felt the buds begin to blow With my love-warmth, another life-dawn glow; Heard all the bells in heaven ring quite plain Because young blood went singing through my brain: Like vernal impulses the verses came; With soul on tiptoe and my words a-flame, I should have sung that we had reached the land Where milk and honey flow o'er golden sand, And that far El Dorado we had found Where nothing less than nuggets gild the ground. But 'tis no more the lyric life of youth, When fancy seemÃ¨d truer than all truth, And standing in that dawn, the sun of love Hung dewy rainbows on each web we wove, And to the leap o' the blood we felt it given To scale the tallest battlements of heaven; Poor was the prize of wisdom's proudest dower Beside that glory of the flesh in flower! And now I cannot sing my ladye's praise, Lark-like, as in the morning of those days When at a touch the song would upward start, And, half in heaven, empty all the heart. 'Tis August with me now and harvest-heat, And in the nest the silence is so sweet; Moreover, love is such a bosom thing, In words its nestling nearnesses take wing; No flower of speech could ever yet express The married sweetness or the homeliness; We cannot fable the ineffable; The tongue is tied too, with the heart at full: Music may hint it with her latest breath, But fails;âher heaven is only reached through Death. The stirring of the sap in bole and boughâ Mere feelingâwill not set me singing now! I thank my God for all that He hath given And ope the windows of my soul to heaven; I think, in bowed and very humble mood, I must be better, He hath been so good. So would I journey to the land above, Clothed with humility and crowned with love. I look no more Without, and think to win The treasures that are only found Within; And, after many years, have grown too wise To search our world for some Lost Paradise; Or feel unhappy should we chance to miss The next life's possibilities in this. 'Tis here we followâbut hereafter find The goal all-golden miraged in the mind. That Age of Gold behind us, and the Isles Where dwell the BlessÃ¨d are but as the smiles Reflected from a heaven that onward lies, The Gold of sundown caught in Orient skies. And yet, if any bit of Eden bloom In this old world, 'tis in the Wedded Home. And, what a wonder-world of novel life Do these two range through, hand-in-hand, as Wife And Husband; in one flesh two spirits paired; Their joys all doubled, all their sorrows shared: Two spirits blending in one heavenward spire, That soars up fragrant from an altar fire; Two halves in one perfection wed to prove The perfect Oneness of immortal love! We cannot see Love with our mortal sight, But lo! the singing Angels come some night To bring His tiny image in the Child Wherewith from out the darkness He hath smiled; The tender voice whereby the All-loving breaks His silence, and in human fashion speaks; The gentle hand put forth to draw us near The heart of life whose pulse is beating here. Though seldom do we guess, so dim our eyes, That God comes down in such a simple guise, And yet of such the kingdom of Heaven is; Through them the next world is revealed in this! And how they come to us to bring us back What we have lost along the dusty track: The sweetness of the dawn, the early dew, The tender green, and heaven's unclouded blue; The treasures that we dropped upon the ground, And they, in following after us, have found! Ah, Love, my life is not so bare of leaf But we can find a nest for shelter if The bounteous heavens should bless us from above And in our branches nestle some wee dove. Nor will my darling lack a touch still warm To finish that fine sculpture of her form; For if Love dwell in me, the Angel-Elf Shall kiss her to some likeness of himself, And little arms shall bow the pride they deck With other bridal fetters for her neck. At the hill-top I reach my resting-place, To find clear heavenâfeel it face to face; Firm footing after all the weary slips, To hold the cup unshaken at the lips. The meaning of my life grows clear at last, And all my troubles smile back now they're past: The clouds put on a glory to mine eyes, My sorrows were my saviour in disguise: And I have walked with angels unawares, And upward mounted, climbing over cares, A little nearer to the home above. Here let me rest in the good Father's love Embodied in these arms embracing me, Serenely as the sea-flowers in deep sea. 'Tis true, just as we feel our foreheads crowned, And all so glorious grows the prospect round, It seems one stride might launch us on heaven's wave, Thenceforth our steps go downward to the grave. What then? I would not rest till spirit rust, And I am undistinguishable dust: And if Love bring no second Spring to me, This is the fore-feel of a Spring to be; If no new Dawn, yet in the evening hours, Freshly bedewed, more sweetly smell the flowers; And round my path the glow of love hath made Illumination for the evening shade. Something, dear Lord, Thou hast for me to say, Or wherefore draw me toward the springs of day, And make my face with happiness to shine By softly placing this dear hand in mine Even while I stretched it to Thee through the dark: A something that shall shine aloft and mark Thy goodness and my gratitude upon This Mount Transfiguration when I'm gone? If Thou hast set my foot on firmer ground, Lord, let me show what helper I have found; If Thou hast touched me with thy loftier light, Lord, let me turn to those that walk in night And climb with more at heart than they can bear, Though but a twinkle through their cloud of care. Only a grain of sand my life may be, But let it sparkle, Lord, with light of Thee! I ask not that my Verse should break in bloom With flowers, to crown my love or wreathe my tomb; Nor do I seek the laurel for my brow, But only that above my grave may grow Some sunny grains of Thine immortal seed That may be garnered up for human need In Bread of Life on which poor souls can feed! Of late my life hath gathered more at root, Making new sap, I trust, for future fruit: Lord, sun my harvest, set it ripening With sheaves in autumn thick as leaves in spring! It is my prayer at night, my dream by day, To make some conquest for the Poor. I pray Thee let me have my one supreme desire, To fill some earthly facts with heavenly fire; Give voice to their dumb world before I die; Their patient pain more piteous than a cry! Let me work now, while all eternity With its large-seeming leisure waits for me. A LETTER IN BLACK. A-floating on the fragrant flood Of Summerâfuller hour by hour; All the Spring-sweetness of the bud Crowned by the glory of the flower,â My spirits with the season flowed, The air was all a breathing balm; The lake a flame of sapphire glowed; The mountains lay in cloudless calm: Green leaves were lusty; roses blushed For pleasure in the golden time; The birds through all their feathers flushed For gladness of their marriage-prime: Listless among the lilies I threw Me down, for coolness, 'mid the sheen: Heaven, one large smile of brooding blue; Earth, one large smile of basking green. A rich suspended shower of gold Laburnum o'er me hung its crown: You look up heavenward and behold It glowing, coming in glory down! There, as my thoughts of greenness grew To fruitage of a leafy dream,â There, friend, your letter thrilled me through, And all the summer lost its gleam. The world, so pleasant to the sight, So full of voices blithe and brave, And all her lamps of beauty alight With life! I had forgot the Grave; And there it opened at my feet, Revealing a familiar face Upturned, my whitened look to meet, And very patient in its place. My poor bereaven friend! I know Not how to word it, but would bring A little solace for your woe,â A little love for comforting: And yet the best that I can say Will only help to sum your loss; I can but look and long, and pray God help my friend to bear his Cross. I have felt something of your smart, And lost the dearest things e'er wound In love about a human heart: I, too, have life-roots underground. From out my soul hath leaped a cry For help! Nor God Himself could save: And tears yet start that naught will dry Save Death's hand with the dust o' the grave. God knows, and we may one day know, These hidden secrets of His love; But now the stillness stuns us so; Darkly, as in a dream, we move. The glad life-pulses come and go, Over our head and at our feet; Soft airs are sighing something low; The flowers are saying something sweet; And 'tis a merry world. The lark Is singing over the green corn; Only the house and heart are dark,â Only the human world forlorn. There, in the bridal-chamber, lies A dear bedfellow all in white; That purple shadow under the eyes, Where star-fire swam in liquid night. Sweet, slippery silver of her talk; The music of her laugh so dear, Heard in home-ways, and wedded walk, For many and many a golden year; The singing soul and shining face, Daisy-like glad by roughest road; Gone! with a thousand dearnesses That hid themselves for us and glowed. The waiting Angel, patient Wife, All through the battle at our side, That smiled her sweetness on our strife For gain, and it was sanctified! When waves of trouble beat breast-high And the heart sank, she poured a balm That stilled them; and the saddest sky Made clear and starry with her calm. And when the world with harvest ripe In all its golden fulness lay; And God, it seemed, saw fit to wipe, Even on earth, all tears away; The good true heart that bravely won, Must smile up in our face and fall; And all our happy days are done, And this the end. And is this all? The bloom of bliss, the secret glow, That clothed without, and inly curled, All gone. We are left shivering now, Naked to the wide open world! A shrivelled, withered world it is, So sad and miserably cold; Where be its vaunted braveries? 'Tis gray, and miserably old. Our joy was all a drunken dream; This is the truth at waking! we Are swept out rootless by the stream And current of calamityâ Out on some lone and shoreless sea Of solitude so vast and deep, As 'twere the wrong Eternity, Where God is not, or gone to sleep. It seems as though our darling dead, Startled at Death's so sudden call, With falling hands and dear bowed head Had, like a flower-filled lap, let fall A hoard of treasures we have found Too late! so slow doth wisdom come! We for the first time look around Remembering this is not our Home. My friend, I see you with your cup Of tears and tremblingâsee you sit; And long to help you drink it up, With useless longings infinite!â Sit rocking the old mournful thought, That on the heart's-blood will be nursed, Unless the blessed tears be brought; Unless the cloudy sorrows burst. The little ones are gone to rest, And for a while they will not miss The Mother-wings above the nest; But through their slumber slides her kiss, And, dreaming she has come, they start, And toss wild arms for her caress, With moanings that must thrill a heart In heaven with divine distress. And Sorrow on your threshold stands, The Dark Ladye in glooming pall: I see her take you by the hands; I feel her shadow over all. Hers is no warm and tender clasp; With silence solemn as the Night's, And veilÃ¨d face, and spirit-grasp, She leads her Chosen up the heights: The cloudy crags are cold and gray, You cannot scale them without scars: So many Martyrs by the way, Who never reached her tower of stars; But there her beauty shall be seen, Her glittering face so proudly pure; And all her majesty of mien; And all her guerdon shall be sure. Well. 'Tis not written, God will give To His Beloved only rest! The hard life of the cross they live, They strive, and suffer, and are blest. The feet must bleed to reach their throne, The brow must burn before it bear One of the crowns that may be won, By workers for immortal wear. Dear friend, life beats though buried 'neath A vast black vault of night! and see There trembles through this dark of death, Starlight of immortality! And yet shall dawn the eternal day To kiss the eyes of them that sleep; And He shall wipe all tears away From tired eyes of them that weep. 'Tis something for the poor bereaven, In such a weary world of care, To think that we have friends in heaven; Who helped us here, may aid us there. These yearnings for them set our Arc Of being widening more and more, In circling sweep through outer dark To day more perfect than before. So much was left unsaid. The soul Must live in other worlds to be; On earth we cannot grasp the whole, For that Love has eternity. Love deep as death, and rich as rest; Love that was love with all Love's might; Level to needs the lowliest! Cannot be less Love at full-height. Though earthly forms be far apart, Spirit to spirit nestles nigher; The music chords the same at heart, Though one voice range an octave higher. Eyes watch us that we cannot see; Lips warn us which we may not kiss; They wait for us, and starrily, Lean toward us from heaven's lattices. We cannot see them face to face, But love is nearness; and they love Us yet, nor change, with change of place, In more than human worlds above, Where love, once leal, hath never ceased, And dear eyes never lose their shine, And there shall be a marriage feast, That turns Earth's water to Heaven's Wine. WIDOW MARGARET. Poor Margaret's window is alight; The Widow sits alone; Though long into the silent night, And far, the world is gone. She lives in shadow till her blood Grows bitter and blackened all; Upon her head a mourning hood; Upon her heart a pall. The stars come nightly out of heaven, Old Darkness to beguile; For her there is no healing given To their sweet spirit-smile. That honey-dew of sleep the skies In blessed balm let fall, Drops not on her poor tired eyes, Though it be sent for all. At some dead flower, with fragrance faint, Her life opes like a book; The old sweet music makes its plaint, And, from the grave's dim nook, The buried bud of hopes laid low, Flowers in the night full-blown; And little things of Long-Ago Come back to her full-grown. Her heart is wandering in a whirl, And she must seek the tomb Where lies her long-lost little girl. O, well with them for whom Love's Morning-Star comes round so fair As Evening Star of Faith, Already up and shining, ere The dark of coming death. But Margaret cannot reach a hand, Beyond the dark of death; Her spirit swoons in that high land Where breathes no human breath; She cannot look upon the grave As one eternal shore; From which a soul may take the wave, For heaven, to sail or soar. Across that Deep no sail unfurled, For her; no wings put forth; She tries to reach the other world By groping down through earth. 'Twas there the Child went underground; They parted in that place; And ever since, the Mother found The door shut in her face. Though many effacing springs have wrapped With green the dark grave-bed; 'Twas there, the breaking heart-strings snapped As she let down her dead; And there she gropes with wild heart yet, For years, and years, and years; Poor Margaret! there will she let Her sorrow loose in tears. All the young mother in her old voice Its waking moan will make! A young aurora light her eyes With radiance gone to wreck: And then at dawn she will return, To her old self again; Eyes dim and dry; heart gray and dern; And querulous in her pain.â âWe never loved each other much, I and my poor good-man; But on the Child we lavished such A love as overran All boundaries, loving her the more Because our love was pent; Striving as two seas try to pour Their strength through one small rent. âFor children come to still link hands, When lives have ebbed apart; And hide the rift, when either stands At distance heart from heart. So on our little one we'd look; Press hands with fonder grasp; As though we closed some holy book, Softly, with golden clasp. âAnd as the dark earth offers up Her little Winterling, The Crocus, pleading with its cup Of hoarded gold, to bring Down all the gray heaven's quickening shower Of Spring to warm the sod; So did we lift the winsome flower That sprang from our dark clod. âOur little Golden-heart, her name! And all things sweet and calm, And pure and fragrant, round her came With gifts of bloom and balm. And there she grew, my flower of all, Pure gold and pearly white; Just as at Summer's smiling call The lily stands alight. âTo knee or nipple, was the goal Of her wee stately walk; The voice of my own silent soul Her darling baby-talk; Then darklingly she dwined and failed; And looking on our dead, The father wailed awhile and ailed, Turned to the wall and saidâ ââ'Tis dark and still, our house of life, The fire is burning low; Our pretty one is gone, old Wife, 'Tis time for me to go: Our Golden-heart has gone to sleep; She's happed in for the night; And so to bed I'll quietly creep, And sleep till morning light.ââ Once more the Widow Margaret rose And through the night passed on. Long shadows weird of tree and house Made ghosts in moonlight wan! She passed into the churchyard, where The many glad life-waves That leapt of old, have stood still there, In green and grassy graves. âO would my body were at rest Beneath this cool grave-sward: O would my soul were with the Blest, That slumber in the Lord! They sleep so sweetly underground; For Death hath shut the door, And all the world of sorrow and sound Can trouble them no more.â A spirit-feel is in the place, That makes the poor heart gasp; Her soul stands white up in her face For one warm human clasp! To-night she sees the Grave astir; And as in prayer she kneels, The mystery opens unto her: She for the first time feels The spirit-world may be as near Us moving silent round, As are the dead that sleep a mere Short fathom underground; And there be eyes that see the sight Of lorn ones wandering, vexed Through some long, sad, and shadowy night Betwixt this world and next. Doorways of fear, are eye and ear, Through which the wonders go; And through the night with glow-worm light, The Church is all aglow! There comes a waft of Sabbath hymn; She enters; all the air With faces fills divine and dim, The Blessed Dead are there. One came and bade poor Margaret sit, Seemed to her as it smiled, A great white Bird of God alit In a forest marble-aisled. âLook to the Altar!â there a spell Fixed her; she saw upstart, A Woman, like a soul in hell, 'Twas her own Golden-heart. âIt would have been thus, Mother dear, And so God took her, from All trials and temptations here, To His eternal home; And you shall see her in a place Where death can never part.â She looked up, and in that pure face Found her own Golden-heart. The lofty music rose again From all those happy souls, Till all the windows thrilled, as when The organ-thunder rolls; And all her life was like a light Weak weed the stream doth sway, Until it reaches the full-height, Breaks, and is borne away. Her life stood still a-listening to The music! then a hand Took hers, and she was floated through A mystic border-land. 'Twas Golden-heart! from that eclipse She drew her into bliss: Two spirits closed at dying lips, In one immortal kiss. Next day an early worshipper Was kneeling in the Aisle; A statue of life that did not stir, But knelt on with a smile Upon the face that smiled with light, As though, when left behind, It smiled on with some glorious sight Long after the eyes were blind. PICTURES IN THE FIRE. Old Winter blows, and whistles hard, To keep his fingers warm, while I Shut out the cold night, frosty-starred, Bleak earth and bitter sky; And to the Fireplace nestle nigher, To pore on pictures in the Fire. It has a soft, blithe, murmuring glow, As if it crooned a cradle-song; Yet whispers of some awful woe Are on each flaming tongue That may have licked up human life, Quick, ruddy as a murderer's knife! I see the Dead Men underground, Just as they found them rank on rank; Old MothersâYoung Wivesâred-eyed round The Corpses brought to bank; I see the mournful phantoms flit About the mouth of Hartley Pit; And that poor Widow above the rest All eminent in Suffering's crown, Who wearing sorrow's loftiest crest Is bowed the lowliest down; Poor Widow with her Coffins seven, Look down on Her, dear God in Heaven! I hear that crash with sinking heartâ Eternity has broken through! I see him play his Hero part, A leader tried and true, Who faithful stood to his last breath, And fell betwixt them and their death. I hear him bid them trim their lampsâ For Light hath not gone out in Heaven! And through the dark, above the damps, He beacons them to haven: Long in his eyes had lived the light That should make starry such a Night. I see the strong man's agony, That seeks to rend his ghastly shroud; The touch of solemn radiancy That kindles through the cloud; The trust that earned a nobler doom Than such a death in such a tomb; The valour that invisibly Lifted the bosom like a targe; The hidden forces that must be, Ready for Life's last charge! And all the bravery brave in vain, And all the majesty of pain: Visions of the old Home that flash With all the mind's last mortal power; The tears that burn their way, to wash A soul white in an hour, When thoughts of God go deeper than The Devil at his utmost can. I hear the poor faint heart's low cry That sickens at the sight of Doom; The prayer of those that feel it nigh, And groping through the gloom! They cower together hand-in-hand At the dark door of the dark land. Ghostly and far away life seems To one returning from a swound; And sharp the sorrow comes in dreams When we are helpless bound; But deathliest swoons, or ghastliest nights, Have no such sounds, or spirit-sights. The waiting human world is near, Yet farther off than Heaven for them Who bow the doomÃ¨d head, to bear Death's cruel diadem, With farewell words of solemn cheer And love for those who cannot hear: Old heads with hair like spray above A tossed and troubled sea of life; Young hearts, just kissed to the quick by Love, That leave a one-day wife. O pathos of a hopeless fate! O pain of those left desolate! 'Tis brave to die in Battle's flash, For the dear country we adoreâ Struck breathless 'mid the glorious crash, When banners wave before The fading eyes, and at the ears We are caught by following Victory's cheers! And sailor-blood that on the waves Can feel the Mother's heaving breastâ True sailor-blood no wailing craves Over its place of rest, When souls first taste eternity In those last kisses of the Sea: And Death oft comes with kind release To win a smile from those that lie Where they may feel the blessÃ¨d breeze, And look up at the sky, And drink in, with their latest sigh, A little air for strength to die: But 'tis a fearful thing to be Instantly buried alive; fast-bound In cold arms of Eternity That clasp the breathing round, And hold them though their Comrades call And dig with efforts useless all. A tear for those who, in that night, Went down so unavailingly; A cheer for those who fought our fight, And missed the victory! Peace to the good true hearts that gave A moral glory to that grave! We know not how amid the gloom Some jewel of the just outshone; With precious sparkle lit the tomb And led the hopeless on To hope, and showed the only way To find God's hand and reach His day. We know not how in that quick hour Some poor uncultured human clod May have put forth its one sweet flower, Acceptable to God: Or how the touch of Death revealed Some buried beauty life concealed: We know now how the Dove of peace Came brooding on the fluttering breast, To make the fond life-yearnings cease, And fold them up for rest; And into shining shape the soul Burst, like the flame from out the coal: We only know the watch-fires burned Long in their eyes for human aid, And failed, and then to God they turned, And altogether prayed, And that the deepest Mine may be, For prayer, God's whispering Gallery! Dear God, be very pitiful To these poor toiling slaves of men; Be gracious if their hearts be dull With darkness of their den: 'Tis hard for flowers of Heaven to grow Down where the earth-flowers cannot blow! Their lives are as the Candle-snuff, Black in the midst of its own light! Let hard hands plead for spirits roughâ They work so much in night. Be merciful, they breathe their breath So close to danger, pain, and death. The love-mist in a Father's eye Must rise, and soften much that's rude In his poor childrenâmagnify The least faint gleam of good! O, find some place for human worth In Heaven, when it has failed on Earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS. OLD FRIENDS. We just shake hands at meeting With many that come nigh; We nod the head in greeting To many that go by,â But welcome through the gateway Our few old friends and true; Then hearts leap up, and straightway There's open house for you, Old Friends, There's open house for you! The surface will be sparkling, Let but a sunburst shine; Yet in the depth lies darkling, The true life of the wine! The froth is for the many, The wine is for the few; Unseen, untouched of any, We keep the best for you, Old Friends, The very best for you! The Many cannot know us; They only pace the strand, Where at our worst we show usâ The waters thick with sand! But out beyond the leaping Dim surge 'tis clear and blue; And there, Old Friends, we are keeping A waiting calm for you, Old Friends, A resting-place for you. SYLVIA MAY. âHeart of mine, so longing for rest, Better to build thy love-lined Nest On a storm-swung bough than a Woman's breast.â But this heart of mine still sayeth me, âNay;â Shows me the picture of Sylvia May; Wilful hearts must have their way! âHeart of mine, far wiser 'twould be To build thy Nest on a wave of the sea, Tossed and troubled perpetually.â But this heart of mine still sayeth me, âNay;â And whispers the name of Sylvia May: Foolish hearts will have their way! âNever was love I think like mine; Never was woman so nearly divine; Never could lives more perfectly twine.â And this heart of mine it murmureth, âYea;â Wilful hearts must have their wayâ When will you marry me, Sylvia May? IN A DREAM. She came but for a little while, Yet with a wondrous gleam; She left within my soul her smile, The Darling of my Dream! O face too clear for sorrow or tear, Too real for masks that seem; I seek, but shall not find her Here, The Darling of my Dream! I wonder do you wait for me Beside the glad Life-stream, Or under the Leaf-of-Healing treeâ You Darling of my Dream! O sometimes lift your veil by night, And let one beauty-beam Fill all my life for days with light, You Darling of my Dream! THAT MERRY, MERRY MAY. Ah! 'tis like a tale of olden Time, long, long ago; When the world was in its golden Prime, and love was lord below! Every vein of Earth was dancing With the Spring's new wine! 'Twas the pleasant time of flowers, When I met you, love of mine! Ah! some spirit sure was straying Out of heaven that day, When I met you, Sweet! a-Maying In that merry, merry May. Little heart! it shyly opened Its red leaves' love-lore, Like a rose that must be ripened To the dainty, dainty core. But its beauties daily brighten, And it blooms so dear,â Though a many Winters whiten, I go Maying all the year. And my proud heart will be praying Blessings on the day, When I met you, Sweet, a-Maying, In that merry, merry May. A LOVER'S FANCY. Sweet Heaven! I do love a Maiden, At her feet I bow love-laden; When she's near me, heaven is round me, Her dear presence doth so bound me! I could wring my heart of gladness, Might it free her lot of sadness! Give the world, and all that's in it, Just to press her hand a minute! Yet she weeteth not I love her; Never dare I tell the sweet Tale, but to the stars above her, And the flowers that kiss her feet. O! to live and linger near her, And in tearful moments cheer her! I could be a Bird to lighten Her sad heartâher sweet eyes brighten: Or in fragrance, like a blossom, Give my life up on her bosom! For my love's withouten measure, All its pangs are sweetest pleasure: Yet she weeteth not I love her; Never dare I tell the sweet Tale, but to the stars above her, And the flowers that kiss her feet. NO JEWELLED BEAUTY IS MY LOVE. No jewelled Beauty is my Love, Yet in her earnest face There's such a world of tenderness, She needs no other grace. Her smiles, her voice, around my life In light and music twine; And dear, O very dear to me Is this sweet Love of mine. O joy! to know there's one fond heart Beats ever true to me! It sets mine leaping like a lyre, In sweetest melody: My soul up-springs, a Deity! To hear her voice divine; And dear, O very dear to me, Is this sweet Love of mine. If ever I have sighed for wealth, 'Twas all for her, I trow; And if I win Fame's victor-wreath, I'll twine it on her brow. There may be forms more beautiful, And souls of sunnier shine, But none, O none, so dear to me, As this sweet Love of mine. THE TWO ROSES. Softly stepped she over the lawn, In vesture light and free; A floating Angel might have drawn Her hair from heaven in a glory-dawn, And her voice rang silverly. Then up she rose on her tiny tip-toes, Her white hand catches, her fingers close: âYou are tall and proud, my dainty Rose; But I have you now,â said She. O so lightly over the lawn, Step for step went he! Thinking how, from his hiding-place, The war of Roses in her face, Dear Love would laugh to see! Two arms suddenly round her he throws, Two mouths, turning oneward, close; âYou are tall and proud, my dainty Rose! But I have you now,â said He. SWEET-AND-TWENTY. Like a Lady from a far land, Came my true Love brave to see! As to heaven its rainbow garland, Is her beauty rich to me. Or as some dim Mere may mirror One fair star that shines above, So my lifeâay growing clearerâ Holds this tremulous star of love. Look you, how she cometh trilling Out her gay heart's bird-like bliss! Merry as a May-morn, thrilling, With the dew and sunshine's kiss. Ruddy gossips of her beauty Are her twin cheeks: and her mouth In its ripe warmth smileth, fruity As a garden of the south. Ha! my precious Sweet-and-Twenty, Husband up your virgin pride! Just a month and this dear, dainty Thing shall be my wedded Bride. THE WEDDING-RING. This old world is scarce worth seeing, Till Love wave his purple wing, And we gauge the bliss of being, Through a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. Would you draw far Eden nearer, And to earth the Angels bring; You must seek the magic mirror Of a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. As the earth with sea is bounded, And the winter-world with spring, So a Maiden's life is rounded With a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. I have known full many a Maiden, Like a white rose withering, Into fresh ripe beauty redden Through a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. As the crescent Moon rings golden, Her full glory perfecting, Womanly beauty is unfolden In a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. Fainting spirits oft grow fearless, Sighing hearts will soar and sing, Tearful eyes will laugh out tearless, Through a golden wedding-ring; Heigho, the wedding-ring. LOVE'S WESTWARD HO! Pleasant it is, wee Wife of mine, As by my side thou art, To sit and see thy dear eyes shine With bonfires of the heart! And young Love smiles so sweet and sly, From warm and balmy deeps, As under-leaf the fruit may try To hide, yet archly peeps: Gliding along in our fairy boat, With prospering skies above, Over the sea of time we float To another New World of Love. One of God's Darlings is our Guide: Ah, how it makes us lean, Hearts beating lovingly side by side That nothing may come between. As yon brave ring of Stars doth fold Our world, so is it given To this wee ring of wedding gold To clasp us round with heaven; Gliding along in our fairy boat, With prospering skies above, Over the sea of time we float To another New World of Love. MY LOVE. My Love is true and tender, Her eyes are rich with rest; Her hair of dappled splendour, The colour I love best; So sweet, so gay, so odorous-warm, She nestles here, heart-high, A bounteous aspect, beauteous form, But, just a wee bit sly. My Love is no light Dreamer, A-floating with the foam; But a brave life-sea swimmer, With footing found in Home. My winsome Wife, she's bright without, And beautiful within; ButâI would not say quite without The least wee touch of sin. My Love is not an Angel In one or two small things: But just a wifely woman With other wants than wings. You have some little leaven Of earth, you darling dear; If you were fit for Heaven, You might not nestle here. LULLABY. Softly sink in slumbers golden, Warm as nestled Birdlings lie, Safe in Mother's arms enfolden, While I sing thy lullaby. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, Sweet one, sleep to my Lullaby. Though the night doth darken, darken, Light will Mother's slumbers lie; Still my heart will harken, harken, Lest her wee thing wake and cry. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, Sweet one, sleep to my Lullaby. At thy golden gate of slumber, Stands my spirit tiptoe-high, Filled with yearnings without number, In thine inner heaven to fly. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, Sweet one, sleep to my Lullaby. In that world of mystic breathing, Spirit Sentinels, stand by! Winnow, winnow, o'er my wee thing, Wings of Love that hover nigh. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, Sweet one, sleep to my Lullaby. Sleep! and drink the dew delicious Till the morrow dawn is high! Sleep with Mother near her precious, Wake! with Mother waiting nigh. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, Sweet one, sleep to my Lullaby. AUTUMN SONG. The summer days are ended; The after-glow is gone; The nights grow long and eerie: The winds awake to moan; The pleasant leaves are fading; The friendly swallows flee; Yet welcome is the Winter That brings my Love to me. No voice of bird now ripples The air; no wood-walk rings! But in my happy bosom The soul of Music sings; It sings of clearest heaven, And summers yet to be; Then welcome to the Winter That brings my Love to me. A world of gathered sunshine Is this warm heart of mine, Where life hath heaped the fruitage, And love hath hid the wine. And though there's not a flower In field, nor leaf on tree; Yet welcome is the Winter That brings my Love to me. SYRINX. Methought to bear her branches crowned With fruit, my virgin vine: Another fills her arms; around Another life they twine! So I lost the day, And all the night I wake,â Bird-like singing sad sorrow away, Until my heart shall break. While others gleaned Life's field for gold, With Flowers I made a crown; Till, looking up alone, behold, The deepening night came down! So I lost the day, And all the night I wake,â Bird-like singing sad sorrow away, Until my heart shall break. Poor me! I clasped a reed, and missed My sweetest Syrinx fled! Poor me! my tenderest music's kissed From lips of dear love dead. I have lost the day, And all the night I wake,â Bird-like singing sad sorrow away, Until my heart shall break. O LAY THY HAND IN MINE, DEAR! O lay thy hand in mine, dear! We're growing old, we're growing old; But Time hath brought no sign, dear, That hearts grow cold, that hearts grow cold. 'Tis long, long since our new love Made life divine, made life divine; But age enricheth true love, Like noble wine, like noble wine. And lay thy cheek to mine, dear, And take thy rest, and take thy rest; Mine arms around thee twine, dear, And make thy nest, and make thy nest. A many cares are pressing On this dear head, on this dear head; But Sorrow's hands in blessing Are surely laid, are surely laid. O lean thy life on mine, dear! 'Twill shelter thee, 'twill shelter thee. Thou wert a winsome vine, dear, On my young tree, on my young tree: And so, till boughs are leafless, And Song-birds flown, and Song-birds flown, We'll twine, then lay us, griefless, Together down, together down. LONG, LONG AGO. Old friend of mine, you were dear to my heart, Long, long ago, long ago. Little did we think of a time we should part, Long, long ago, long ago. Hand clasped in hand through the world we would go. Down our old untrodden path the wild weeds grow! Great was the love 'twixt us; bitter was the smart: Old friend of mine long ago. Patient watch I kept for you many, many a day, Long, long ago, long ago; Waited and wept for you far, far away, Long, long ago, long ago. Merry came each May-tide, new leaves would start: Never came my old friend back to my heart. Lonely I went on my weary, weary way, Old friend of mine long ago. Oft as I muse at the shadowy nightfall Over the dear Long Ago: Borne on tears arises the dark, dark pall, Fallen on my heart long ago. Love is not dead, though we wander apart; How I could clasp you, old friend, to my heart! Barriers lie between us, but God knoweth all, Old friend of mine long ago. A SOLDIER'S WIFE. âAround us the day closes dense as a wood, The Stars down the darkness with eerie eyes brood, While out through the nightfall my restless thoughts flee To him who is fighting far over the sea. âAcross the mirk Moorland the birds of night cry; A wind stirs my flesh as of ghosts gliding by; Oh, clasp thy hands, pretty one, kneel down with me, And pray for thy Father far over the sea. âSo brave is my darling, so gallant and gay, He'll flash through the fight in the wild, bloody day; He'll crest the top wave upon valour's red sea; God shield him! God send him back safely to me!â He's lying, poor Wife! with the valiant and tried, Who to-night shed their life on a reddened hillside: And still she sings tenderly, âOver the sea, Blow, breezes, and bring back my darling to me.â Her soul it sat smiling, all meek as a dove, In her pure perfect face that was lighted with love; Her child to the full heart endearing she drew, And bowed like a Flower 'neath its blessing of dew. Some luminous Presence glides over the place, A white mist of glory! a white spirit-face! And a starry Shape comes slow and sweet from the gloom; God help thee, poor Widow! thy husband is home! She knows not the Spirit that hovereth nigh, Nor whence fell the slumber that healed her heart's cry; But she weeps in her vision, and prayerfully Still murmurs, âGod send him back safely to me!â ROBIN'S SONG. Sing, Robin Redbreast, Though you fill our hearts with pain: Sing, bonny Robin, Though our tears fall like the rain For a Lamb far from the fold, In the wet and wintry mould! For a Bird out in the cold, Bird alane! Bird alane! Sing, Robin Redbreast! You are welcome to our door; Sing, darling Robin, Merry Larks no longer soar: Autumn comes with feel of rain, Mournful odours, wail of pain! There's a Bird will come again Nevermore! Nevermore! Sing, Robin Redbreast! For we love your song so brave, Though you mind us of a Robin Where the willows weep and wave: To her little grave it clings, Shakes the rain from its wet wings, And for all the sadness sings By Her grave, by Her grave. THE ONLY ONE. With tired feet, o'er thorny ground, My spirit made its quest; On wearied wing it wandered round, But could not find a nest; Till at the feet of Love I found At last my Only Rest! I went the downward way of Doom, With those that walk in Night: I stumbled on from tomb to tomb Of Joys that lured my sight; Until Love touched me through the gloom And smiled,âmy Only Light! O, sweet the touch of hearts, and sweet The tie of Child and Wife, And blessÃ¨d is the Home where meet True Souls that shut out strife; And as I nestle at Love's feet, I know my Only Life. A MAIDEN'S SONG. I love! and Love hath given me Sweet thoughts to God akin, And oped a living Paradise My heart of hearts within: O from this Eden of my life God keep the Serpent Sin! I love! and into Angel-land With starry glimpses peer! I drink in beauty like heaven-wine, When One is smiling near! And there's a Rainbow round my soul For every rising tear. Dear God in heaven! keep without stain My bosom's brooding Dove: O clothe it meet for angel-arms, And give it place above! For there is nothing from the world I yearn to take, but Love. LOVE. O Love! Love! Love! Its glory breaks our gloom, And there's a new Heaven overhead, With all the earth in bloom. 'Tis sweet as Sunshine's golden kiss, That crowns the world anew: Sweet as in Roses' hearts of bliss, Soft summer-dark drops dew. O Love! Love! Love! May make the true heart ache; Pulse out its lavish life, and leave It mournfully to break! But O how winsomely it starts The thoughts that bee-like cling, To drain the honey from young hearts, And leave a bleeding sting! O Love! Love! Love! Its very pain endears! And every wail and weeping brings Some blessing on our tears! Love makes our darkest days, sweet dove! All goldenly go down, And still we'll clothe ourselves with love, And crown us with Love's crown. NOW AND THEN. O Love will make the leal heart ache That never ached before; And meek or merry eyes 'twill make With solemn tears run o'er. In tears we parted tenderly, My Love and I lang syne; And evermore she vowed to be Mine own, aye mine, all mine! Sing O the tree is blossoming, But worms are at the root; And many a darling flower of Spring Will never come to fruit. We meet now in the streets of life; All gone, the old sweet charms; At my side leans a loving Wife; Sheâpasses Babe-in-arms. EMIGRANT SONG. Behind us lies a land, all dim With sighs of sorrows old; Before us, on the ocean's rim, A land that looks of gold. We go, a fuller life to win, With freedom for th' opprestâ But won't forget the old land, in That new world of the West. We cannot weep who cross the deep, Unfairly driven forth; We might not sow, we could not reap Our share of native earth. We go, a fuller life to win, With freedom for th' opprestâ But won't forget the old land, in That new world of the West. As Emigrants from land to landâ From rise to set of sun, We build the bridge till ocean's spanned, And all the world is one. We go, a fuller life to win, With freedom for th' opprestâ But won't forget the old land, in That new world of the West. THE SAILOR'S ORPHAN CHILD. How happy seems the Sailor's lot, On Summer seas to roam, With pleasant dreams of that wee Cot Where wife and weans make âhome.â But he must also face the war Of winds and waters wild, To fall, perchance, from home afar, And leave an orphan child. The Sailor in the tempest strives With might and main for you; When raging billows race for lives, The Sailor brings us through. Then succour those he leaves behind, As sea-drift safely Isled; The Sailor's orphan is a kind Of every parent's child. ON DECK TOGETHER. Out of the water the wingÃ¨d fish flew, Flashes of light from abysses of blue, In the goldenest tropical weather; A pale still face seemed calling to me; Words of cheer were spoken, and we Were friends on deck together. Under a still and starry night My lady arose to her stateliest heightâ Hair without tie or tetherâ And there between the sky and the sea, She walked and talked right merry with me, As we trod the deck together. We meet no more the deck to tread; But, when the Oceans have yielded their dead, I cannot help wondering whether There will be another world where we May voyage on some celestial sea, And tread the deck together. A PEARL DIVER. Soul of Jacoba, come forth from your shell, My pearl of the Deep where you darklingly dwell, The Diver hath found you, the secret is shown, Never again will you nestle unknown; Nevermore feel in your loneness alone! Soul of Jacoba, arise and shine From the sea-green depths of her eyes divine; Soul of Jacoba, come forth and play In the pale still face with a roseate ray, And a smile that shall turn all the dark into day! My Pearl! that I saw by her own soft light; My Pearl that bejewelled the gloom of her night, The secretly precious, the hiddenly rare; A prize to be won for the worthiest wear; My Pearl shall be set with the first of the fair! PARTING. Too fair, I may not call thee mine: Too dear, I may not see Those eyes with bridal beacons shine; Yet, Darling, keep for meâ Empty and hushed, and safe apart, One little corner of thy heart! Thou wilt be happy, dear! and bless Thee; happy mayst thou be. I would not make thy pleasure less; Yet, Darling, keep for me, My life to light, my lot to leaven, One little corner of thy Heaven! Good-bye, dear heart! I go to dwell A weary way from thee; Our first kiss is our last farewell; Yet, Darling, keep for meâ Who wander outside in the night, One little corner of thy light! âFOR EVER.â âFarewell, Sweet! may you find a nest Of home in haven dearer: And safelier rest upon the breast Of truer love and nearer! May favours fall, and blessings flow For you, and cares come never! But kiss me, dear, before you go, And then shake hands for ever.â Her very heart within doth melt, And gathers while she lingers A weeping warmth, as though it felt A wee Babe's feeling fingers: The minutes pass, they do not part, And vain was all endeavour; A touch had closed them heart to heart, And hands were clasped for ever. SHAKSPEARE. Our Prince of Peace in glory hath gone, With no spear shaken, no sword drawn, Without one battle-flag unfurled, To make his conquest of the world. For him no martyr-fires have blazed, No limbs been racked, no scaffolds raised! For him no blood was ever shed To dye the Conqueror's raiment red. And for all time he wears the crown Of lasting, limitless, renown: He reigns, whatever Monarchs fall; His throne is at the heart of all. âALL READY AND ALL ONE.â What is the News to-day, Boys? Have they fired the Signal gun? We answer but one way, Boys: We are ready for the fray, Boys. All ready and all one! They shall not say we boasted Of deeds that would be done; Or sat at home and toasted: We are marshalled, drilled and posted, All ready and all one! We are not as driven cattle That would the conflict shun. They have to test our mettle As Volunteers of Battle, All ready and all one! The life-streams of the Mother Through all her youngsters run, And brother stands by brother, To die with one another, All ready and all one! Sydney, 1885. ENGLAND. There she sits in her Island-home, Peerless among her Peers! And Liberty oft to her arms doth come, To ease its poor heart of tears. Old England still throbs with the muffled fire Of a Past she can never forget: And again shall she herald the World up higher; For there's life in the Old Land yet. They would mock at her now, who of old looked forth In their fear, as they heard her afar; But loud will your wail be, O Kings of the Earth! When the Old Land goes down to the war. The Avalanche trembles, half-launched, and half-riven, Her voice will in motion set: O ring out the tidings, wide-reaching as Heaven! There's life in the Old Land yet. The old nursing Mother's not hoary yet, There is sap in her ancient tree: She lifteth a bosom of glory yet, Through her mists, to the Sun and the Seaâ Fair as the Queen of Love, fresh from the foam Or a star in a dark cloud set; Ye may blazon her shame,âye may leap at her name,â But there's life in the Old Land yet. Let the storm burst, you will find the Old Land Ready-ripe for a rough, red fray! She will fight as she fought when she took her stand For the Right in the olden day. Rouse the old royal soul, Europe's best hope Is her sword-edge for Victory set! She shall dash Freedom's foes down Death's bloody slope; For there's life in the Old Land yet. THE OLD LAND. O leal high hearts of England, The evil days draw near, When ye, with steel in heart and hand, Must strike for all that's dear! And better tread the bloodiest deck, And fieriest field of fame, Than break the heart and bow the neck, And sit in the shadow of shame. Let Despot, Death, or Devil come, United here we stand: We'll safely guard our Island-Home, Or die for the dear old Land. O, Warriors of Old England, You'll hurry to the call; And her good ships shall sail the storm, With their merry Mariners all. In words she wasteth not her breath, But be the trumpet blown, And in the Battle's dance of death, She'll dance the bravest down. Let Despot, Death, or Devil come, United here we stand: We'll safely guard our Island-Home, Or die for the dear old Land. Success to our dear England, When dark days come again; And may she rise up glorious As the rainbow after rain. A thousand memories warm us still, And, ere the old spirit dies, The purple of each wold and hill From English blood shall rise. Let Despot, Death, or Devil come, United here we stand: We'll safely guard our Island-Home, Or die for the dear old Land. God strike with our dear England! Long may the old land be The guiding glory of the world; Home of the fair and free! Old Ocean on his silver shield Shall lift our little Isle Unvanquished still by flood or field, While the heavens in blessing smile. Let Despot, Death, or Devil come, United here we stand: We'll safely guard our Island-Home, Or die for the dear old Land. SEA-SONG. Come, show your Colours now, my Lads, That all the world may know The Boys are equal to their Dads, Whatever blast may blow. All hands aboard! our country calls On her Seafaring folk! In giving up our wooden Walls, More need for Hearts of Oak. Remember how that old Fire-Drake Would singe the Spaniard's beard; And think how Raleigh, Nelson, Blake, Into their harbours steered. Think how o' nights we cut them out! 'Twas many a time and oftâ Silence!âa rushâa tugâa shoutâ And the old flag flew aloft. Be it one to seven,âbe it Hell or Heaven,â We fought our decks red-wet! Be it hell or heaven,âbe it one to seven.â We fear no Foeman yet. At every port-hole there shall flame The same fierce battle-face: All worthy of the old sea-fameâ All of the old Sea-Race. OUR NATIVE LAND. This is our Mother Country! The dearest land; The rarest land. Round which the sea keeps sentry, Or Ships are manned; Or ships are manned. Nothing but Heaven above her! And here's my hand; And here's my hand. We are brothers all who love her, Our Native Land; Dear Native Land. Afar and near they hail her, With greetings warm; With greetings warm. The famous old brave Sailer, That rode the storm; Ay, many a storm. Who would not die to save her, Shall bear the brand; The Coward's brand. In love we never waver For Native Land; Dear Native Land. No matter where our place is, We may go forth; We may go forth. And turn dead frozen faces Home from the North; Home from the North. Or sink 'neath orient Heaven, In burning sand; Waste, desert sand. Our lives shall still be given For Native Land; Dear Native Land Oft-times the Foe beheld us, All torn apart; All torn apart. Although a blow would weld us All one at heart; All one at heart. Now trust we in each other, A little band; A happy band. As Children of one Mother! Our Native Land; Dear Native Land. Some new heroic story The world shall learn; The world shall learn. If we who keep her glory Are true and stern; All true and stern. Come wild and warring weather, We ready stand; All ready stand. To fight or fall together For Native Land; Dear Native Land. A NATIONAL ANTHEM. God bless our native Land, Glorious, and grave, and grand, God bless our Land! God bless her noble face, God bless her peerless race, Great heart, and daring hand, God bless our Land! God love our native Land, Make her for ever grand, God love our Land! Robe her with righteousness, Crown her with gifts of grace, Throne her at Thy right hand, God love our Land! If secret foes should band To strike our dear old Land, God aid our Land! Be Thou her strength and stay, God, in the battle day; Strew them ashore like sand, God aid our Land! Few are we, Sword in hand; All sword in soul we stand, Around our Land! And when her blood shall flow, Green make her glory grow, Lead her in triumph grand, Our leal old Land! Here pray we hand in hand, Tears in our eyelids stand, God save our Land! Thy Watch-tower on the Sea, Venger of Right is she, Long let old Fear-not stand, God save our Land! HAVELOCK'S MARCH. Behold a phantom-form appears, majestic in its gloom! Mournfully it looks across a Chasm deep as doom: A quivering heartache seems to move its withered, wordless lips; Familiar eyes are kindling through their wan light of eclipse: It is the Ancient Mother rising, Sphinx-like, 'mid her sands, To plead with those who will not hear. She wrings her wrinkled hands; Yearns over both. As Brothers long ago she brought them forth, Her dusky darlings and her great white Heroes of the North! The Children have no memories of the Morning-Land, and yet The Mother's heart remembers, though all the world forget. We look with horror, when the blood grows cold, On that which stung us hotly enough of old; Blame me not wantonly: I do but draw Faintly the thing we felt; the sight we saw! THE REVOLT. âCome hither, my brave Soldier boy, and sit you by my side, To hear the tale, a fearful tale, a glorious tale of pride; How Havelock with his handful, all so faithful and so few, Held on in that far Indian land, to bear our England through Her bloodiest pass of peril, and her reddest sea of wrath; And strode like Paladins of old on their avenging path. Though clothes were drenched, and flesh was parched, or bones were chilled with cold, The gallant hearts never gave up; they never loosed their hold; But fought right on, and triumphed, till our eyes rained as we read How proudly every place was filled, with living and with dead. âThe stillness of a brooding storm lay on that Eastern land; The dark death-circle narrowed round our little English band: The false Sepoy stooped lower for his spring, and in his eye A bloody light was burning on them, as he glided by: Old Horrors rose, and leered at them, from out the tide of time,â The peering peaks of War's old world, whose brows were stained with crime! The conscious Silence was but dumb, a cursÃ¨d Plot to hide; The darkness only a mask of Death, ready to slip aside. Under the leafy palms they lay, and through their gay green crown Our English saw no Storm roll up: no Fate swift-flaming down. âAt last it came. The Rebel drum was heard at dead of night: They dashed in dust the only torch that showed the face of Right! Once more the Devil clutches at his lost throne of the earth, And sends a people, smit with plague of madness, howling forth. As in a Demon's dream they swarm from horrible hiding-nooks; Red Murder stabs the air, and lights their way with maddening looks! Snuffing the smell of human blood, the cruel Moloch stands; Hearing the cry of âKill! Kill! Kill!â and claps his gory hands. At dead of night, while England slept, the fearful vision came, She looked, and with a dawn of hell the East was all aflame. âStern tidings flashed to Havelock, of legions in revolt: âThe Traitors turn upon us, and the eaters of our salt, Subtle as death, and false as hell, and cruel as the grave, Have sworn to rend us by the root; be quick, if ye would save; The wild beasts bloody and obscene, mad-drunk with gore and lust, Have wreaked a horrible vengeance on our England rolled in dust.â And such a withering wind doth blow, such fearful sounds it brings, The soul with shudders tries to shake off thoughts like creeping things. A vast invisible Terror twines its fingers in the hair, With one hand feeling for the throat; a hand that will not spare. âThey slew the grizzled Warrior, who to them had been so true; The ruddy stripling with frank eyes of bonny northern blue; They slew the Maiden as she slept; the Mother great with child; The Babe, that smiled up in their face, they stabbed it as it smiled! The piteous, pleading, hoary hair they draggled in red mire; And mocked the dying as they dashed out, frantic from the fire, To fall upon their Tulwars, hacked to Death; the bayonet Held up some child; the demons danced around it writhing yet: Warm flesh, that kindled so with life, was torn, and slowly hewn, To daintiest morsels for the feast where Death began too soon. âOur English girls, whose sweet red blood went dancing on its way, A merry marriage-maker quick for its near wedding-day,â All life awaiting for the breath of Love's sweet south to blow, And budding bridal roses ripe with secret balms to flow,â They stripped them naked as they were born; naked along the street, In their own blood they made them dip their delicate white feet: With some last rag of shelter the poor helpless darling tries To hide her from the cruel hell of those devouring eyes; Then, plucking at the skirts of Death, she prayerfully doth cling, To hide her from the eyes that still gloat round her in a ring. THE AVENGERS. ââNow, Soldiers of our England, let your love arise in power; For never yet was greater need than in this awful hour: Together stand like old true hearts that never fear nor flinch; With feet that have been shod for death, never to yield an inch. Our Empire is a Ship on fire, before a howling wind, With such a smoke of torment, as might make high heaven blind! Wild Ruin waves his flag of flame, and ye must spring on deck, And quench the fire in blood, and save our treasures from the wreck.â Many a time has England thought she sent her bravest forth; But never went more gallant men of more heroic worth. âHungry and lean, through rain and mire, our War-wolves ravening go On their long march, that shall not mete the red grave of the foe: Like winter trees stripped to their naked strength of heart and arm, That glory in their grimness as they tussle with the storm! Only a handful few and stern, and few and stern their words; Strange meaning in their eyes that meet and strike out sparks like swords! And there goes Havelock, leading the Forlorn Hope of our land: The quick heart spurring at their side; the banner of their band: Kindled, but calm, along their ranks his steady eye doth run, As Marksman seeks the death-line down the level of his gun. âBeneath the whitening snows of age his spirit-ardours glow, As glow the fragrant fires of spring in flowers beneath the snow. Look in his grave and martial face, with Love's dear pity touched; A saviour soul doth sanctify the sword his hand hath clutched; A little while his silent thoughts have gone within to pray, And send a farewell of the heart to the dear ones far away. He prays to God to light him through the perilous darkness, when He grapples with the beasts of blood, and quells them in their den. And now his look is lifted in the light of some far goal; His lips the living trumpet of a gray-haired Seer's soul. âOn th' house-tops of Allahabad black, scowling brows were bent, In hate, and deep, still curses, on our heroes as they went To fight their hundred-days-long fight; all true as their good steel, The Highlanders of Havelock, the Fusileers of Neil! A falling firmament of rain the heavens were pouring down; They heeded not the drowning heavens, nor yet the foeman's frown: Forward they strained with hearts afire, and gallantly they toiled Till darkness fell upon them: then the Moon uprose and smiled. A little thing! and yet it seemed at such a time to come Just like a proud and mournful smile from the very heart of Home. âThat night they halted in a Snipe-swamp; hungry, cold, and drenched; With hearts that kept the blitheness of brave men that never blenched. Through flooding Nullah, slushy sand, onward they strode again, Ere Dawn, a winÃ¨d glory, lit upon the burnished rain, And mists up-gathered sullenly along the rear of flight, Slowly as beaten Belooches might lounge from out the fight. Then heaven grew like inverted hell; a blazing vault of fire! The Sun pursuing pitiless, to bring the brain-strokes nigher; With sworded splendours fierce in front, and darting down all day, Intently as the eyes of Death a-feeding on his prey. âAll the day long, and every day, with patience conquering pain, Our good and gallant fellows with one purpose forward strain; For there is that within each heart nothing but death can stop; They hurry on, and hurry on, and hurry till they drop; Trying to save the remnant; reach the leaguered place in time To grasp, with red-wet slaughtering hands, the workers of this crime. They think of all the dead that float adown the Ganges' waters: Those noble Englishmen of ours; their gentle wives and daughters! Of Fire and Madness broken loose, and doing deeds most pitiful; And then of vengeance dealt out by the choked and blackened city-full. âThey think of those poor things that climb each little eminence; As, from the deluge of the dark, when day is going hence, The sheep will huddle up the hill, and gather there forlorn; So gather they in this dread night, to wait the far-off morn. Or, crouching in the Jungle, they look up in Nature's face, To find she has no heart, for all her Reptilinear grace! Each leaf a sword, or prickly spear, or lifted jagged knife! No shields of shelter like our leaves; but threatening human life, With ominous hints of blood; and there the roots go writhing round, Like curses coiled upon the spring, that rest not underground. âThey find sure tokens all the day! and starting from their dream At night, they hear the Pariah dogs that howl by Ganges' stream, Knowing the waters bear their freight of corpses stiff and stark, Scenting the footfalls on the air, as Death glides down the dark; Only the Lotus with ripe lips, and arms caressing clings. The silence swarms with ghostly thoughts; each sound with ghastly things. There stands the plough i' the furrow; there the villagers have flown! There Fire ran dancing over roofs that underfoot went down! There Renaud hung his dangling dead, with but short time for shrift, He caught them on their way to hell, and gave them a last lift. âThey saw the first sight of their foe as the fourth dawn grew red; Twenty miles to breakfast marched; and had to fight instead. The morning smiled on arms up-piled, and weary wayworn men, But soon the Assembly sounded, and they sprang to arms again; The heaviest heart up-leaping light, as flames that tread on air. The Rebel line bore down as they had caught us unaware; But Maude dashed forward with his Guns, across the sandy mire, And little did they relish our bright rain of rifle fire: Quickly the onward way was ploughed, with heaps on either hand; They broke the foe, then broke their fast, that dauntless little band. âAgain they felt our withering fire, by Pandoo Nuddee stream; Again they feared the crashing charge, and fled the vengeful gleam: Small loss was his in battle when the Conqueror looked round; But many fell from weariness, and died without a wound. Soft, whispering flowery secrets, came a low wind of the west That eve, like breath made balmy with the sweet love in the breast; Breathing its freshness through the groves of Mango and of Palm; But the sweetest thing that wind could bring was slumber's holy balm, To bless them for the morrow, and give strength for them to cope With those ten thousand men that stood betwixt them and their hope. âIt must have been a glorious sight to see them as they went, With veteran valour steady; sure of proud accomplishment. When Havelock bade his line advance, the Highlanders swept on; Each one at heart a thousand; a thousand men as one; Linked in their beautiful proud line across the broken lands, Straight on! they never paused to lift the weapon in their hands; Silent, compact and resolute, charged as a thundercloud That burst, and wrapped the dead and living in one smoky shroud; One volley of Defiance! one wild cheer! and through the smoke They flashed! and all the battle into flying fragments broke. âWhen night came down they lay there, gashed all over, side by side, The gray old warrior and the youth, his Mother's darling pride! Rolled with the rebel in the dust, and grim in bloody death; And over all the mist arose, dank as the graveyard's breath. But light of heart we took the hill, and very proud that night Was Havelock of his noble men, and Cawnpore was in sight. The men had neither food nor tent, but the red road was won: And very proud were they to hear their General's âWell doneâ; Not knowing how their shout of triumph rang a fatal knell; Nor what that wretch had wrought who has no match this side of Hell. CAWNPORE. âCawnpore was ghastly silent, as into it they stepped; There stood the blackened Ruin that the brave old Soldier kept! Where strained each ear for the English cheer, and stretched the wan wide eyes, Through all that awful night to see the signal-rocket rise; No tramp, no cheer of Brothers near; no distant Cannon's boom; Nothing but death goes to and fro betwixt the glare and gloom. The living remnant try to hold their bit of bloodstained ground; Dark gaps continual in their midst; the dead all lying round; And saddest corpses still are those that die, and do not die: With just a little glimmering light of life to show them by. âEach drop of water cost a wound to fetch it from the well; The father heard his crying child and went, but surely fell. They had drunk all their tears, and now dry agony drank their blood; The sand was killing in their souls; the wind a fiery flood; Oh, for one waft of heather-breath from off a Scottish wold! One shower that makes our English leaves smile greener for its gold! Then life drops inward from the eyes; turns upward with last prayer, To look for its deliverance; the only way lies there: And then triumphant Treachery made leap each trusting heart, Like some poor Bird called from the nest, uppoising for the dart. ââCome, let us pray,â their Chaplain said. No other boon was craved: No pleading word for mercy sued; no face the white flag waved; But all grasped hands and prayed, till peace their souls serenely filled; Then like our noble Martyrs, there they stood up, and were killed. Only One saved! He led our soldiers to the House of Blood; An eager, panting, cursing crew! but stricken dumb they stood In silence that was breathlessness of vengeance infinite; A-many wept like women who were fiercest in the fight: There grew a look in human eyes as though a wild beast came Up in them at that scent of blood and glared devouring flame. âAll the Babes and Women butchered! all the dear ones dead; The story of their martyrdom in lines of awful red! The blood-black floor, the clotted gore, fair tresses, deep sword-dints; Last message-scrawl upon the wall, and tiny finger-prints: Gathered in one were all strange sights of horror and despair, That make the vision blood-shot, freeze the life, or lift the hair. Faces to faces flashed hell-fire! Oh, but they felt 'twould take The very cup of God's own wrath, that gasping thirst to slake: For many a day âCawnporeâ was hissed, and, at its word of guilt, The slaying sword went merciless, right ruddy to the hilt. âThere came a time we caught them, with a vast o'erwhelming wave, And of their grand Secunder Bagh we made a trophied grave. Once more the Highlanders pressed on with stern avenging tread, And Peel was there with his big guns, and Campbell at their head: A spring of daring madness! and they leapt upon their prey With hungry hearts on fury fed, for many and many a day. For hours and hours they slew, and slew, the devils in their den: âYe wreaked your will on Women weak, now try it with strong men.â The blood that cried to heaven long in vapours from our slain, Fell hot and fast upon their heads in showers of ruddy rain. âThat day they saw their delicate white marbles glow and swim; There rose a cry like hell from out a slaughter great and grim: And as they clasped their hands and sued for mercy where they fell, One last sure thrust was given for that red and writhing Well. And there was joy in every heart, and light in every eye, To see the Traitor hordes that fled, make one last stand to die! While from the big wide wounds, like snakes, the runlets crawled along And stole away; the reptiles who had done the cruel wrong! A terrible reprisal for each precious drop they spilled. Seventeen hundred cowardly killers there were bravely killed. THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW. âEngland's unseen, dead Sorrow doth a visible Angel rise; The sword of Justice in her hand; Revenge looks through her eyes: Stern with the purpose in her soul right onward hastens she, Like one that bears the doom of worlds, with vengeful majesty; Sombre, superb, and terrible, before them still she goes! And though they lessen day by day, they deal such echoing blows, That still dilating with success, still grows that little band, Till in the place of hundreds, ten thousand seem to stand. With arms that weary not at work, they bear our victor flag, To plant it high on hills of dead, a torn and bloody rag. âProud Lucknow lies before them,âall its pageantry unrolled; Against the smiling sapphire gleam her tops of lighted gold. Each royal wall is fretted all with frostwork and with fire, A glory of colour jewel-rich, that makes a splendour-pyre, As wave on wave the wonder breaks, the pointed flames burn higher, On dome of Mosque and Minaret, on pinnacle and spire; Fairy Creations, seen mid-air, that in their pleasaunce wait, Like wingÃ¨d creatures sitting just outside their heaven-gate. The City in its beauty lies, with flowers about her feet; Green fields, and goodly gardens, make so foul a thing seem sweet. âThe Bugle rings out for the march, and, with its fiercest thrill, Goes to the heart of Havelock's men, and works its lordly will, Making their spirits thrill as leaves are thrilled in some wild wind; Hunger and heartache, weariness and wounds, all left behind. Their sufferings all forgotten now, as in the ranks they form; And every soul in stature rose to wrestle with the storm. All silent! what was hid at heart could not be said in words: With faces set for Lucknow, ground to sharpness, keen as swords. A tightening twitch all over! a grim glistening in the eye, âForward!â and on their way they strode to dare, and do, and die. âHope whispers at the ear of some, that they shall meet again, And clasp their long-lost darlings, after all the toil and pain; A-many know that they will sleep to-night among the slain; And many a cheek will bloom no more for all the tearful rain: And some have only vengeance; but to-day 'tis bitter sweet; And there goes Havelock! his the aim too lofty for defeat; With steady tramp the column treads, true as the firm heart's-beat: Strung for its headlong murderous march through that long fatal street. All ready to win a soldier's grave, or do the daring deed! But not a man that fears to die for England in her need. âThe masked artillery raked the road, and ploughed them front and flank; Some gallant fellow every step was stricken from the rank; But, as he staggered, in his place another sternly stepped; And, firing fast as they could load, their onward way they kept. Now, give them the good bayonet! with England's sternest foes, Strong arm, cold steel has done it, in the wildest, bloodiest close: And now their Bayonets flash in forks of Lightning up the ridge, And with a cheer they take the guns, another, clear the bridge. One good home-thrust! and surely, as the dead in doom are sure, They send them where that British cheer can trouble them no more. âThe fire is biting bitterly; onward the battle rolls; Grim Death is glaring at them, from ten thousand hiding-holes; Death stretches up from earth to heaven, spreading his darkness round; Death piles the heaps of helplessness face downward to the ground; Death flames from sudden Ambuscades, where all was still and dark; Death swiftly speeds on whizzing wings the bullets to their mark; Death from the doors and windows, all around and overhead, Darts, with his cloven fiery tongues, incessant, quick, and red: Death everywhere, Death in all sounds, and, through its smoke of breath, Victory beckons at the end of long dark lanes of death. âAnother charge, another cheer, another Battery won! And in a whirlwind of fierce fire the fight went roaring on Into the very heart of hell: with Comrades falling fast, Through all that tempest terrible, the glorious remnant passed. No time to help a dear old friend: but where the wounded fell, They knew it was all over, and they looked a last farewell. And dying eyes, slow-setting in a cold and stony stare, Turned upward, saw a map of murder scribbled on the air With crossing flames; and others read their fiery fearful fate, In dark, swart faces waiting for them, whitening with their hate. âBut, proudly men will march to death, when Havelock leads them on: Through all the storm he sat his horse as he were cut in stone! But now his look grows dark; his eye gleams with uneasy flash: âOn, for the Residency, we must make a last brave dash.â And on dashed Highlander and Sikh through a sea of fire and steel, On, with the lion of their strength, our first in glory, Niel! It seemed the face of heaven grew black, so close it held its breath, Through all the glorious agony of that long march of death. The round shot tears, the bullets rain; dear God, outspread Thy shield! Put forth Thy red right arm, for them, Thy sword of sharpness wield! âOne wave breaks forward on the shore, and one falls helpless back: Again they club their wasted strength, and fight like âHell-fire Jack.â Sobriquet of Captain Olpherts. And ever as fainter grows the fire of that intrepid band, Again they grasp the bayonet as 'twere Salvation's hand. They leap the broad, deep trenches, rush through archways streaming fire; Every step some brave heart bursts, heaving deliverance nigher: âI'm hit,â cries one, âyou'll take me on your back, old Comrade, I Should like to see their dear white faces once before I die; My body may save you from the shot.â His Comrade bore him on: But, ere they reached the Bailie Guard, the hurrying soul was gone. âAnd now the Gateway arched in sight; the last grim tussle came. One moment makes immortal! dead or living, endless fame! They heard the voice of fiery Niel, that for the last time thrilled; âPush on, my men, 'tis getting darkâ: he sat where he was killed. Another frantic surge of life, and plunging o'er the bar, Right into harbour hurling goes their whirling wave of war, And breaks in mighty thunders of reverberating cheers, Then dances on in frolic foam of kisses, blessings, tears. Stabbed by mistake, one native cries with the last breath he draws, âWelcome, My Friends, never you mind, it's all for the good cause.â âHow they had leaned and listened, as the battle sounded nigher; How they had strained their eyes to see them coming crowned with fire! Till in the flashing street below they heard them pant for breath, And then the friendly faces smiled clear from the cloud of death; And iron grasp met tender clasp; wan weeping women fold Their dear Deliverers, down whose long brown beards the big tears rolled. Another such a meeting will not be on this side heaven! The little wine they have hoarded, to the last drop shall be given To those who, in their mortal need, fought on through fearful odds, Bled for them, reached them, saved them, less like men than glorious gods. DEATH OF HAVELOCK. âThe Warrior may be ripe for rest, and laurelled with great deeds, But till their work be done, no rest for those whom God yet needs: Whether in rivers of ruin their onward way they tear, Or healing waters trembling with the beauty that they bear; Blasting or blessing they must on: on, on, for ever on! Divine unrest is in their breast, until their work is done. Nor is it all a pleasant path the sacred band must tread, With life a summer holiday, and death a downy bed! They wear away with noble use, they drink the tearful cup; And they must bear the Cross who are bidden with the Christ to sup. âEach day his face grew thinner, and sweeter, saintlier grew The smiling soul that every day was burning keenlier through. And higher, each day higher, did the life-flame heavenward climb, Like sad sweet sunshine up the wall, that for the sunset time Seems watching till the signal that shall call it hence is given; Even so his spirit kept the watch, till beckoned home to heaven. His work was done, his eyes with peace were soft and satisfied; War-worn and wasted, in the arms of Victory he died. âHavelock's dead,â and darkness fell on every upturned face; The shadow of an Angel passing from its earthly place. âIn the red pass of peril, with a fame shall never dim, Died Havelock, the Good Soldier: who would not die like him? In grandest strength he fell, full-length; and now our hero climbs To those who stood up in their day and spoke with after times: There on the battlements of Heaven, they watch us, looking back To see the blessing flow for those who follow in their track. He smileth from his heaven now; the Martyr with his palm; The weary warrior's tired life is crowned with starry calm. On many sailing through the storm another star shall shine, And they shall look up through the night and conquer at the sign. âThey laid it low, the old gray head, not only gray with years; It had been bowed in Sorrow's lap and silvered with her tears; Our England may not crown it, with her heart too full for speech; The hand that draws into the dark, hath borne it beyond reach. The eyes of far-away heaven-blue, with such keen lustre lit, As they could pierce the dark of death, and, star-like, fathom it, They may not swim with sweetness as the happy Children run To welcome home the Reaper, when the weary day is done! How would the tremulous radiance round the old man's mouth have smiled; Our good gray-headed hero, with the heart of a little child. âHonour to Henry Havelock! though not of kingly blood, He wore the double royalty of being great and good. He rose and reached the topmost height; our Hero lowly born: So from the lowly grass hath grown the proud embattled Corn! He rose up in our cruel need, and towering on he trod; Baring his brow to battle bold, as humbly to his God. He did his work, nor thought of nations ringing with his name, He walked with God, and talked with God, nor cared if following Fame Should find him toiling in the field, or sleeping underground; Nor did he mind what resting-place, with heaven embracing round. âWhen swarming hell had broken bounds, he showed us how to stand With rootage like the Palm amidst the maddest whirl of sand; Undaunted while the swarthy storm around him swirled and swirled, A winding-sheet of all white life! a wild Sahara world! The drowning waves closed over him, lost to all human view, And, like an arrow straight from God, he cleft their Twelve Hosts through. No swerving as he walked along the rearing earthquake-ridge; He made a way for Victory, his body was her bridge. Grand in the mouths of men his fame along the Centuries runs; Women shall read of his great deed and bear heroic sons. âHe leant a trusting hand on heaven, a gentle heart on home; In secret he grew ready, ere the Judgment hour was come. War blew away the ashes gray, and kindled at the core Live sparkles of the Ironside fire that glowed on Marston Moor. Some Angel-Mute had led him blindfold through his thorny ways, Till, on a sudden, lo, he stood, full in the glory's blaze. Aloud, for all the world to hear, God called His servant's name, And led him forth, where all might see, upon the heights of fame. His arch of life, suspended as it sprang, in heaven appears, Our bow of promise o'er the storm, seen through rejoicing tears. âJoy to old England! she has stuff for storm-sail and for stay, While she can breed such heroes, in her quiet, homely way: Such martial souls that go with grim, war-figured brows pulled down, As men that are resolved to bear Death's heavy, iron crown. So long as she has sons like these, no foe shall make her bow, While Ocean washes her white feet; Heaven kisses her fair brow. If India's fate had rested on each single saviour soul, They would have kept their grasp of it till we regained the whole. The Lightnings of that bursting Cloud, which were to blast our might, But served to show its majesty clear in the sterner light. âOur England towers up beautiful with her dilating form, To greater stature in the strife, and glory in the storm; Her wrath's great wine-press trodden on so many vintage fields, With crush and strain, and press of pain, a ripened spirit yields, To warm us in our winter, when the times are coward and cold, And work divinely in young veins: wake boyhood in the old. Behold her flame from field to field on Victory's chariot wheels, Till to its den, bleeding to death, Rebellion backwards reels. Her Martyrs are avenged! ye may search that Indian land, And scarcely find a single soul of all the traitor band. âWe've many a nameless Hero lying in his unknown grave, Their life's gold fragment glinting but a sunfleck on the wave. But rest, you unknown, noble dead! our Living are one hand Of England's power; but, with her Dead she grasps into the land. The flower of our Race shall make that Indian desert bud, Its shifting sands drench firm, and fertilize with English blood. In many a country they sleep crowned, our conquering, faithful Dead: They pave our path where shines her sun of empire overhead; They circle in a glorious ring, with which the world is wed, And where their blood has turned to bloom, our England's Rose is red. âYour brother Willie, Boy, was one of Havelock's little band; My Son! my beautiful brave Son, lies in that Indian Land. They buried him by the wayside where he bowed him down to die, While Homeward in its Eastern pomp the Triumph passed him by. And even yet mine eyes are wet, but 'tis with that proud tear A lofty feeling in its front doth like a jewel wear. I see him! on his forehead shines the conqueror's radiant crest, And God's own Cross of Victory is on his martial breast. I should have liked to have felt him near, when these old eyes grow dim, But gave him to our England in her greater need of him.â ONLY A DREAM. As proper mode of quenching legal lust, A RouÃ© takes unto Himself a Wife: 'Tis Cheaper when the bones begin to rust, And there's no other Woman you can trust; But, mind you, in return, Law says you must Provide her with the physical means of life: And then the blindest beast may wallow and roll; The twain are One flesh, never mind the Soul: You may not cruelly beat her, but are free To violate the life in sanctuary; In virgin soil renew old seeds of Crime To blast eternity as well as time: She must show black and blue, or no divorce Is granted by the Law of Physical Force. Soft as a snow of light in a silent world The veil of sleep dropped tremulously down And gently covered up the face of life. The nurse-like Spirit laid my body to rest, And went to meet her Bridegroom in the night, Who comes like music o'er the star-shored sea, And clasps her at the portal with a kiss. When lo, a hand reached through the dark, and drew Me gliding wraith-like on, and looking up The unfeatured gloom grew into Charmian's face; The stately Charmian with her lofty mien Like a Greek Goddess Statue that had raised The Veil of being in some diviner dawn, When yearning Love did woo her into Woman,â The warm heart glowing her white Silence throughâ Who rose up in her crown the Queen of Smiles With all the old majesty unweeting of The old worship, conscious hearts must newly pay,â Our English Vesture cannot mask her mould! I read her look, and we two wandered forth In the cool glory of the glimmering night: The Earth lay faint with love at the feet of Heaven; Her breath of incense went up through the leaves In a low sough of bliss. Above us burned The golden legends on Night's prophet-brow; The Moon rose o'er the city, a glory of gold; All round us Life rehearsed Death's mystery. And Charmian wore her June-like loveliness As in a stole of sorrow; by day she moved In some serene Elysium; queenly sweet, And gracious; breathing beauty; a heaven of dreams In her large lotus eyes, darkly divine: Love-kindling Ardours curved her parted lips. But now her blooming Life's luxuriant flower Seemed withered into ashen spirit-fruit, And like a Spirit's flashed her white, lit face! Portentous things which hid themselves by day, Sweet-shadowed 'neath her sunning beauty-bloom, Came peering through the dim and sorrowy night. Her lips, red-ripe to crush their fire-strong wine, Pouting persuasive in perpetual kiss, Were thin with anguish, bitter-pale with pain. And from the windows whence young Beauty laughed, As Age went by, a life of suffering looked, And perished visions flashed their phantom-light. White waves of sea-like soul had climbed, and dashed The red light from its heaven of her cheek: Her bounteous breast that breathed magnificence, And billowed with proud blood, sighed meekly now: The flowers her Spartan spirit crowned her with For the life-battle, dropped about her dead. Diaphanous in the moonlight grew her life With all its written agony visible; Down the dark deep of her great grief I stared, And saw the Wreck with all its dead around. And my heart melted in its mournfulness; She moaned, as hers were breaking in its pain; And then her voice vibrated piteous as A Spirit wailing in a world of tears, But stifled half its pathos not to hurt. âEarth sleeps, and wears the moonlight's mystic grace, The breath of blessings round her; and all heaven Is passing through her dream; it trembles near; She feels the kiss of comfort on her face; But she will wake at morn in tears to find The glory goneâall was a dream o' the night. And thus my young Life slumbered, dreamed, and woke! âIt ran in shadow like the woodland brook, Feeling its way, with yearnings for the light, Until it flashes silver in the sun, And takes a crown of radiance on its head. Even so I found Him whom my soul had sought, And fled into his breast with a cry of triumph, Who lit up all things beautiful for me. And through my happy tears there looked in mine A spirit sweet as morning violets, A face alight with love ineffable, The starry heart-hid wonder trembling through: And o'er me leaned,âas Spring-heaven over earth, Dropping its love down in a rain of flowers,â To feed me with all flowers of delight, And crown me as his Queen of all delight. Light hung a garland-grace about his brow; His voice, like footprints in the yielding snow, Sank deepest with its softest fall of words. He gave the casket of his happiness Rich with Love's jewel for my hands to keep. Around his stalwart strength my life entwined, In golden oneness, and in proud repose; And like a God he clasped me with his strength! And like a God he held me in his heaven; And all the air was golden with my God. âAlas, that Woman's life divorced from Man's, And seeking to be one again in love, So often flies back through the grim wide wound! Alas, that Time should crown with fruit of pain, That seed from heaven whose fair flower is love! They tore me from my Love! they thrust him forth, Spurned his rich love, and scorned his poverty; Rent all the twining tendrils of my life To shrink back bleeding in their desolate home. My life was shattered like the charmÃ¨d cup That, breaking, brings the Hall in ruins round; And every fragment mirrored the great wrong! âAnd while my mind yet wandered dark and dumb, They sold me to a Worldling wrinkled, rich And rotten, who bought Love's dear name for gold. They dressed me in Bride-flowers who should have worn The white and wimpled weeds of widowhood, And led me forth, a jewelled mockery! 'Twas like a wedding with the sheeted dead, In silent hurry, and white ghastliness. No bosoms beat Love's cymbals music-matched; No blisses blushed, no bridal-kisses burned. The ring was on my hand, few saw the chain By which the owner drew me to his home, And many envied me my happiness. That night as we sat alone I felt his eyes Burningly brand me to the core, his Slave. âWe dwelt amid a wildering world of wealth, Which flamed a glistering glory, bloomed a warmth Without, within was cold as a fireless hearth. The Image of Nuptial Love to which they led A maiden sacrifice i' the Sanctuary, That should have raised me, smiled my tears away, And into quickness all my coldness kissed, And fed with precious oil the lamp of love That in my heart, as in a tomb, burned on, Was a gaunt Skeleton whose grave-like grasp Clutched me for ever to a loveless breast. âHe was a cruel Tyrant, just too mean To murder, although pitiless as the grave; A human ink-fish spreading clouds around When eyes of tender ruth would come too near. He had a thin-lipped lust of power which looked On torture in no rage of fiery blood, But with infernal light of gloating eyes. And yet I strove to love him. O my God! While reaching from the heights of blessedness, How had I stretched my arms too eagerly, And fall'n into a chasm that caught me and closed Its dark inevitable arms, and crushed Me, bruised and blind! I struck, and struck, and beat With bleeding strength, in vain. A hundred hands Fought in the gloom with mine as water weak. At every step there stirred some loathly snake. I felt as one that's bound, and buried alive; The black, dank death-mould stamped down overhead; I cried, and cried, and cried, but no help came. âI heard the sounds above me far away; The feet of hurrying Life, and loitering Love; Rich bursts of music, hum of low, sweet talk; The dance of Pleasure dancing in her heaven, And rustling rain of a thousand dear delights. I knew the pictured world was lighted up, And bloomed, like bridal chambers, soft and warm: How sang the merry, merry birds of bliss; How Beauty's flower-guests stood crowned and drank The health of Heaven with its dew for wine. But not a crumb of all the glad life-feast, Nor drop of all the wanton wealth for me, And if I stretched weak arms to clasp my world, A wormy mouth to my wild warmth was pressed; And if I turned to lift a prayer to God, Above me burned two eyes like bottomless pits In which a brood of devils lurk and leer. And down my night there stooped no smiling heaven, With golden chances of a starry throne, And beckoning looks that bid us come be crowned. âAround me rose the phantoms of the dark, The Grave's Somnambules troubled in their dream, Who walk and wander in the sleep of Death, And cannot rest, they were so wronged in life. The crownless Martyrs of the marriage-ring! Meek sufferers who walked in living hell, And died a life of spiritual Suttee. They came to claim their kin in misery, And show me, lifting up the mourning-pall, Their symbols of unutterable woe; Scarred loves that bore the rack and told no tale; Tear-drownÃ¨d hearts and stifled agonies; The bleeding lips struck dumb by brutal hands; Slow murders of the curtained bridal-bed; The silent tortures and the shrouded deaths. âI wandered with them in the pitiless night Who seek the jewel fallen from Life's crown; Oft stumbling, bled upon the cruel thorns, But rose, and staggered on. I strained mine eyes Upon the dark, and raised mine empty cup; Surely with one gold drop of honey-dew, Somewhere the heavens ran o'er t' enrich my life? âThen came to me a thing most sweet and strange, As though an angel kissed me in the night, Or Magic Rose flushed open in the gloom. A loosening charm wrought in my brain; the weight That ached to be dashed out-in utter death, Was thawing like a wintry clod in flowers. In love's dead ashes burst a spark. I cried, âO sweet light-bringer, in a bloom of dawn Rise, let me see what treasure I have found! My rich, warm jewel, crimson with sweet life, Come shine where now I cross but empty palms, And clasp the new love-raiment radiant round. My little Bird shall hurry out the night, Till all my world is touched with rosy gold: My little Bird of God shall sit and sing The dear day long, the dearer for the dark! ââIf you rise beautiful from Sorrow's sea, As Venice, Sorrow's Child, is Beauty's Queen, Perchance thy little smiles, my Babe, may bring Some human softness in his face, and I Shall press the hand that hurts, for thy dear sake. And I shall walk with thee, my Child, with thee, Beneath new heavens, on an enchanted earth. When I enfold thee in my arms, sweet Babe, My heart will scarcely breathe lest it should wake The sleeping wings of its new-nestling bliss. When thou art born, my Child, all will be well; For surely love but vanished in the dark To come back in the morning with my Babe; And all the sweetness liveth on when all The bitterness is past; and eyes that yearned Wet through the gloom are glorified at last. Soft baby-fingers feeling round my heart Shall melt its frost; and baby-lips shall turn My tears to milk, and suck my sorrows dry. All hell may wrestle in one human heart; All heaven will nestle in my drop of dew.â âIt came, my dazzling dawn's re-orient hope, My tiny babe, with its sweet mournful eyes! And the pale innocent but fanned his hate To frenzy; for, in many a desolate day, And midnight, lying with my heart awake, I had turned tearfully to look upon A precious picture worn by Memory, And in its beauteous image grew my Babe: It had his likeness, was his Spirit-child. Its luminous look had gathered all the light That lost beloved Presence left with me. My Tyrant poured his poison in the glass My babe-joy-bearer lifted to my lips, And dashed the new love-vintage in the dust. I ran the gauntlet of his hell for years, And fell down on the threshold mad. My Child! They took my Babe from me, my pleading Babe; And when the pretty one pined for me, and strained His dim eyes for me till my darling died, They called the Mother in to see her child That lay there in the little shroud with all Its beauty folded up for God in heaven: Dead! dead! its dear eyes closed by stranger hands. âMuch misery hath not made my spirit meek: Mine agony rends the bridal-veil: I cry, Come see what ghastly wounds bleed hidden here! Behold where all the Tortures of the Past Are stored by Law, and sanctified for use. I drag my burthen to a Nation's throne, And pray deliverance from this despot's power. Pity me, all good people, as ye sit Within the happy circle of sweet marriage, Loving and loved, glorying and glorified; Whose love makes life so dear, that when ye die And sit on heavenlier heights, your eyes will search To find the garden where Love's fruitage grew; The nest from whence your pretty nurslings flew; Our old World smiling through its cloudy fold, And love it for the marriage-love of old.â She ceased, and from afar methought there came Across the night an echo sad and low, Love answering love, heart crying unto heart. âIn the merry spring-tide when green buds start; Wings break from the husk of care; The dead beauty blossoms again in my heart As I dream of the Springs that were: The buried Past lifteth a radiant brow; A phantom-bark toucheth life's shore; And it floateth me far from the sorrowful Now, Into Love's happy Nevermore. âShe rises before me, that Darling of mine, Whom I lost in the world so wide; O come to me, come to me, let thine arms twine About me, my life! my Bride! Ah me! I am breaking my heart to see But her Image enshrined at its core; Yet Memory's sighs bring a balm to me, Out of Love's happy Nevermore. âLovely she was as the lily is white, When the pride of the morning it wears: Pure she was as the perfect light That haloeth happy tears. Hearts straightway rose from the shadow and cloud, Where the light of her presence kissed; Yet over the might of the proudest she rode, Like Music, as she list. âLove, rosy-clear, in her cheek's faint dyes, Its first sweet bloom just took; Love came trembling up in her eyes, As the stars in a happy brook: Dear eyes! they were dreams of heaven, with a dance Of light in their deep rich gloom; Whence the smiling heart looked like the golden glance From the pansy's purple bloom. âHow I poured all my life in a beaker of bliss For her! how I held the cup, As the leaves, though the troubling winds will kiss, Their tremulous dews hold up! And my mind it walked in a raiment white, Where starry thoughts reared a dome; And the feast was spread, and the chamber alight For the Guest that never came home. âO Darling of mine! does she ever think Of the old-time thoughts and things? O Darling of mine! does she come to drink At these wormwood spirit-springs? For I sometimes dream as I bend above, That the touch of her lip clings there, And the fading balm of her breath of love Is eloquent in the air. âIf we met unaware, just to ease her heart's pain, Would she fall on my bosom and sob? Or would old memories glide through her brain With never an added throb? Is her pillow e'er wet in the dead night-hours? When the heat of the day is o'er, Does she turn, like me, for a handful of flowers, Into Love's happy Nevermore? âO there is no heart that loves on earth But may live to be loved again: Some other heart hath the same dear birth, And aches with the same sweet pain. And Love may yet come with a golden ray Shall lighten my life's despair: But Love hath no second shaft can slay The first love nestling there. âIn the merry spring-tide when green buds start; Wings break from the husk of care; The dead beauty blossoms again in my heart, As I dream of the Springs that were: The buried Past lifteth a radiant brow, A phantom-bark toucheth life's shore: And I am borne far from the sorrowful Now, Into Love's happy Nevermore. All this was but the imagery of dream; For when the Morn in restless radiance rose, Her breath of beauty palpitating light, With clouds of colour smiling from the ground; A sparkling ecstasy in the blue air; And I with marvelling eyes had broke the seal Of slumber, read the letter of my Dream, Lo, Charmian in her summer-sumptuous beauty! And oft the dimple gleamed upon her cheek, To vanish like a dew-drop in a rose; And oft her laugh with reckless richness rung, And shook a shower of music-pearls around. I peered into the luminous dark of her eyes, As one might come by light of day to look Adown the glade where he had seen the dance Of weird Elves in the night, but finds no trace. Queen of the Sister-Graces! who could know Hers was the face that writhÃ¨d in my dream? But still, as in my Dream, I see her stand, Too living for a picture in romance, Telling the wild stern story of her wrongs, Holding the great Curse up to heaven for ever, To call God's lightning down, although it kill Her with her wedded Curse. And in my Dream The kings and queens of prospering love go by, And little heed this Martyr by the way; This poor weak woman trembling 'neath her load; This life fast fettered to a festering corse; This love that bleeds to death at many wounds: This passing Tragedy of Soul within Our five acts of the Sense, that breaks its way Through human hearts i' the Theatre of a world. Keir, 1856. AN ORPHAN FAMILY'S CHRISTMAS. I. A blithe old Carle is Christmas; You cannot find his fellow; Match me the hale red rose in his cheek, Or the heart so mild and mellow; The glitter of glory in his eyes, While the Wassail-cup he quaffs, Or the humour that twinkles out of his wrinkles As helplessly he laughs. Of all High-Tides 'tis Christmas Most richly crowns the year; Right through to land there ripples and runs Its flood of merry good cheer. Troops of friends come sailing down, Making a pleasant din; Fling open doors! set wide your hearts! 'Tis Christmas coming in. A glorious time is Christmas, We gather all at home, And like the Christmas fairies, With their pranks, our darlings come; And gentle Sylvan Spirits hid In holly-boughs they bring, To grow into good Angels, And bless our fairy-ring! A jolly time is Christmas, For Plenty's horn is poured; Then flows the honey of the Sun, Our fruits all summer hoard! Merry men tall march up the hall: They bear the meats and drinks; And Wine, with all his hundred eyes, Your hearty welcome winks. And O the Fire of Christmas, That like some Norse God old, Mounts his log up chimney, and roars Defiance to the cold! He challenges all out-of-doors: He wags his beard of flame; It warms your very heart to see Him glory in the game. A happy time is Christmas; Young hearts will slip the tether; Lips moist and merry, all under the berry, Close thrillingly together. A gracious time! the poorest Poor Will make some little show, And ailing infants, seeing the fun, Will do their best to crow! II. But there are nooks in Poverty's dim world, Where the high tide of bounty never runs. No drop of all its wealth for some who sit And hear the river of riches brimming by. They see the Christmas shows of wealth and warmth, At window, whilst shut out at every door! The Plenty only flouts their poverty; The music mocks them with its merriment; They look into each passing face and find No likeness of their own deep misery. In one of these dark nooks, at Christmas time, An Orphan family, with little fire, And only light enough to see the gloom, Together sat; two Sisters and one Brother; The youngest six years old; the eldest twelve; An old Grandfather lying ill a-bed. They knew that Christmas came, but not for them. Thus had they often sat o' winter nights, Shivering within, as darkness shuddered without, And creeping close together for heart-warmth; Poor unfledged nurslings with the Mother gone! Feeling a Presence brooding over them, In whose chill shadow they were pall'd and hooded; So mournfully it kept the Mother's place! Till flesh would creep as though about to leave The spirit nakedâbare to the cold breath That whispers of the graveâall lidless eye To that appalling sight the helpless Dead Lie looking on, in their amazement, dumb, And petrified to marble! So they sat; The Shadow in the house and on the heart; The old Clock ticking through the lonely room, With sounds that make the silence solemner, And weird hands pointing to far other times; Talking of merry Christmas coming in; Of visionary futures, and old days, With thoughts so far beyond their years! The life In their young eyes gleamed preternaturally, Betwixt the fire-shine, and the dim night-shadows, As their old inmates of the heart stole forth To people the old ways they walked once more. And so, like those lorn pretty Babes i' the Wood, That Robins buried when the talk was done, They told each other stories; sang their Hymns; By way of bribing the gaunt Solitude, Not to look down upon them quite so grim! Poor darlings, with no Father, and no Mother. III. Ay me, dear Sister, gentle Brother, How soft the thought of a Mother lies At heart; how sweet in sound 'twill rise; And these poor Children had no Mother! No Mother-arms in secret nook To fold the sufferer to her breast, With love that never breaks its rest, And Heartsease in her very look. No Mother-wings to brood above The winter nest and keep them warm; And shield them from the pitiless storm, With the large shelter of her love. No Mother's tender touch that brings A music from the harp of life, Like hovering heaven above the strife And precious trembling of the strings. No Mother with her lap of love Each night for heads that bow in prayer; Dear hands that stroke the smiling hair, And heart that pleads their cause above. No Mother whose quick, wistful eye Will see the shadow of Danger near, And face, with love that casts out fear, The blow that darkly hurtles by. No Mother's smile ineffable, To stir the Angel in the bud, Till, into perfect womanhood, The Flower blushes at the full. No Mother! when the Darling One Bends with a grief that breaks the flower, To loose the sorrow in a shower, And lift the sweet face to the sun. No Mother's kiss of comfort near The River that Death overshades; Or voice that, when the dim face fades, Sounds on with words of solemn cheer. Ay me, dear Sister, gentle Brother, How soft the thought of a Mother lies At heart; how sweet in sound 'twill rise; And these poor Children had no Mother. IV. Yet, God is kind; His ways are Fatherly. Affliction's hand, it seem'd, had, at a touch, Awoke the Mother in the young Child-heart Of little Martha, who had now become A wee old woman at twelve years of age, With many Motherly ways. Yea, God is kind. The tiny Snowdrop braves the wintry blast; He tenderly protects its confidence That lifts the venturous head, safe in His hand: And Martha, in her loneliness of earth, And such a dearth of human fellowship, And such companionship with solitude, Had found a way of looking up to Heaven: And oft I think that God in heaven smiled; Holding His hand about her little life, As one that shields a candle from the wind. She had the faith to feel Him nearest, when The world is farthest off; and, in this faith, Her spirit went on wings, or, hand-in-hand With Love that digs below the deepest grave, And Hope that builds above the highest stars. In the old days before their sorrow came, And vast Eternity oped twice to them, And each time, following the lightning-flash, They groped in darkness for a Parent gone, She was the merriest of merry souls; The gay heart laughing in her loving eyes; The peeping rose-bud crimsoning her cheek; There was as quick a spirit in her feet, As now had passed into her toiling fingers, That match the Mother's heart with Father's hands In their unwearied working for the rest. In those old days the Father made a song About his little maid, and sang it to her. V. âIt is a merry Maiden, With spirits light as air; While others go heart-laden, And make the most of care, She trips along with laughter: Old Care may hobble after. âA sunbeam straight from heaven She dances in my room; The gladdest thing e'er given To cheer a heart or home: My stream of life may darkle, She makes the brighter sparkle. âHer smile it is the Morning That turns the mist to pearls; All thought of sadness scorning, She shakes her sunny curls; And, with her merry glancing, She sets all hearts a-dancing.â VI. But now the Maid was changed, for she had been With Sorrow in its chilly sanctuary; Her look was paler, for it had been touched With that white stillness of the winding-sheet, That smile forlornly sweet upon the face When left forever widowed of the soul. Henceforth her life went softly all its days As if she felt the Grave-turf underfoot. Her beauty was more spiritual; not aged Or worn; less colour, but more light. It was a brier-rose beauty, tremulous With tenderest dew-drop purity of soul. I've often seen how well their favour wears Whose sufferings are for others, not for Self; How long they keep a fair unfurrowed face, Whose tears are luminous with healing love,â The pearly cars that bring good spirits down To water and enrich their special flowers,â And do not come from cares that kill the heart; These sere no bloom; they leave no snaky trail. So Martha kept her face, and might have been The younger sister of that lily Maid, The lovable Elaine of Astolat. VII. We write the tale of Heroes in the blood They shed when dying where they nobly stood; And the red letters gloriously bloom To light the warrior to a loftier doom. But there are battles where no cheers arise, And no flags wave before the fading eyes; Heroes of whom the wide world never hears; Their story only writ in Woman's tears. Yet that invisible ink shall surely shine Brightest in Heaven, and verily divine. And when God closes our world's blotted book, To cast it in the fire with awful look, It was so badly written, leaf on leaf Thus lived might touch the Father's heart with grief. And this Child-Mother's life may yield one story That shall be told among the first in glory. Her busy love and thoughtful care are such, The others do not miss the Mother much. From dawn to dark her presence lights the place With many a gleam of reliquary grace. Their few poor things in seemly order stand, Bright as with last touch of the Parent's hand. The clothes are mended, and the house is kept Clean as of old; bravely hath Martha stepped In Mother's footprints; her wee feet have tried Their best to track the Parent's larger stride. With household work her little hands are hard, Her arms are chilled, her knees with kneeling scarred: Dusty her hair that might have richly rolled With warm Venetian glow of Titian's gold. Great-hearted little woman; she toils still, Though the Grandfather, lying old and ill, To her twin troubles adds a heavier third, She works on without one complaining word. VIII. And once a year she has her Holiday; One day of airy life in fairyland, When young leaves open large their palms to catch The gold and silver of the sun and shower; Shy Beauty pusheth back her glittering hood, To peep with her flower face; the Silver Birk Shakes out her hair full-length against the blue; The Fir puts forth her timid finger-tips, Like shrinking damsel trying a cold stream In which she comes to bathe. In merry green woods She rambles where the blue wild hyacinths Smile with their soft dream-haze in tender shade: The lightsome dance of gladsome green above; The whispering sweetness of the wood below; Birds singing, as for love of her, all round: Or, by the Brook that turns some stray sunbeam To a crooked scimitar of wavy gold, Then to itself laughs at the elvish work! With her large eyes, and eager leaping looks, She pores o'er Nature's living picture-page, And gets some colour in her own pale life. Then home, with kindled cheek, when Eve's one Star Stands, waiting on the threshold of the night, In lively expectation of all heaven. IX. Home when the happy day is done, Home comes my little Maid; Her pleasureâgolden in the sunâ Now dewy in the shade. Thoughts of the day will hover and bless Her sleep with sacred balminess. Through shutting eve the stars will peep, But still there comes no night; 'Tis but the Day hath fallen asleep And smiles in dreams of light. And Martha feels the heart of Love Beat on in silent stars above. X. To-night they sit with sadder, lonelier thought Than ever; closer comes the Wolf of Want, And darklier falls the shadow of Orphanhood. For now the old man keeps his bed, and seems Death-stricken, with his face of ghastly gray; His life all crowded in cold glittering eyes Watching the least light movement that is made. The Boy, a blithe and sunny godsend, gay As singing fountain springing in their midst, With loving spirit leaping to the light, Is low at heart to-night, and sad and still. While Dora, in whose purple-lighted eyes There seems the shadow of a rain-cloud near, With but a faint shine of the cheery soul; She longs to fly away and be at rest, And give her wishes wings in measured words That win strange pathos from her sweet young voice. âCome to the Better Land, that Angels know; They walk in glory, shining as they go! The King in all His beauty takes the least To sit beside Him at the eternal feast.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â âFrom old heart-ache, and weariness, and painâ Sorrows that sigh, and hopes that soar in vainâ Come to the Loved and Lost who are now the Blest; They dwell in regions of Eternal rest.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â âHere all things change; the warmest hearts grow cold; The young head droops and dims its glorious gold; Where Love his pillow hath made on Beauty's breast, The creatures of the Grave will make their nest.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â âThe dear eyes where each morning rose our light, Soon darken with their last eternal night; The heart that beat for us, the hallowed brow That bowed to bless, are cold and silent now.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â âNor fear the Grave, that door of Heaven on Earth; All changed and beautiful ye shall come forth, As from the cold dark cloud the winter showers Go underground to dress, and come forth Flowers.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â âCome to the Better Land, that angels know; They walk in glory, shining as they go! The King in all His beauty takes the least To sit beside Him at the eternal feast.â Thus sings the voice that calls me night and day. âThis is a weary world, Come, come, come away! Ah, 'tis a dreary world, Come, come away.â XI. âNay, Sister,â says the cheery Martha, âthough Our lot be sad, your strain's too sorrowful! We cannot spare you yet. Nor must we stoop To make our burthen heavier; hear me, love. âA little Flower so lowly grew, So lonely was it left, That Heaven looked an eye of blue Down in its rocky cleft. âWhat could the little Flower do In such a darksome place, But try to reach that eye of blue, And climb to kiss Heaven's face? âAnd there's no life so lone and low But strength may still be given From narrowest lot on earth to grow The straighter up to Heaven.â Again she sang, and set them singing too. âHere we are poorest of God's Poor, Toiling for bread from day to day, But laid up in Heaven a treasure is sure, While Money is round and rolls away. And though there's room for all the rest, I think God loves the Little Ones best. âLittle hearts make merry, and sing How His love to Children warms! Little voices ripple and ringâ How He takes them in His arms! And though there's room for all the rest, I think God loves the Little Ones best.â XII. Then, silent Fabyan lifted up his look, Bright as a Daisy when the dews have dried; A sudden thought struck all the sun in his face. âMartha and Dora, I know what I'll do! I'll write a Letter to the good Lord Jesus, Who helps us if we put our trust in Him.â The sisters smiled upon him through their tears. This was the Letter little Fabyan wrote. âDear, beautiful Lord Jesus, Christmas is drawing near; Its many shining sights we see, Its merry sounds we hear: With presents for good Children, I know Thou art going now, From house to house with Christmas trees, And lights on every bough. âI pray thee, good Lord Jesus, To bring one tree to us, All aglow with fruits of gold, And leaves all luminous. We have no Mother, and, where we live, No Christmas gifts are given; We have no Friends on earth, but Thou Art our good Friend in Heaven. âMy Sisters, gentle Jesus, They hide the worst from me; But I have ears that sometimes hear, And eyes that often see. Poor Martha's cloak is worn threadbare, Poor Dora's boots are old; And neither of them strong like me, To stand the wintry cold. âBut most of all, Lord Jesus, Grandfather is so ill; 'Tis very sad to hear him moan, And startling when he's still. Ah! well I know, Lord Jesus, If Thou would'st only come, He'd look, and rise, and leave his bed, As Lazarus left his tomb. âForget us not, Lord Jesus, I and my sisters dear; We love Thee! when Thou wert a Child Had we been only near, And seen Thee lying, bonny babe, In manger or in stall, Thou should'st have had a home with us; We would have given Thee all.â XIII. The Letter signed and sealed, their prayers are said, And Martha lights the younger Bairns to bed. With all a Mother's heart she bends above Their rest, her eyes filled with a Mother's love. For soon their voices cease; life fades away Into its quiet nest, till morrow-day: As the lake-lilies shut their leaves of light When down the gloom descends the hush of night, In fear of what is passing, bow the head Beneath the water, they shrink down in bed. But soon the Angel Sleep doth smile all fear Away with wooing whispers at the ear; And they will ope at morn eyes bathed in bliss; Their faces fresh from their good Angel's kiss. But Martha sleeps not yet; now they are gone, Brave little woman, she must still work on, And watch, to-night, for Grandfather is worse, She thinks, with no one near, save her for nurse. XIV. 'Tis very sad to hear a man so old, Talk of his mother who, beneath the mould, Has lain an age, and see his childish tears, That have to pierce the crust of eighty years. He turns and turns, incapable of rest, Tossed on the billow that heaves in brain and breast; A life that beats with all too weak a wave To land him on the other side the Grave! The old man mutters in his broken dream. âLast night I wander'd in a world of moan; I saw a white Soul going all alone, Over the white snows of eternity; I followed far, and followed fast to see The face, and lo, it was my own.â And now he muses by some weird sea-side. âThe tide is a-making its bonny Death-bed; The white sea-maidens rise ready to wed; Nearer and nearer, unveiling their charms, They toss for their lovers, long, shadowy arms! Dancing with other-world music and motion; Brides of dead Sailors; the Beauties of Ocean. âWave after wave my worn, old Bark has tossed; One moment saved, another it seemed lost For ever, still it righted from each blow; But the great wave is coming on me now! I see it towering high above the rest; A world of eyes in its white glittering crest; See how it climbs, calm in its might, and curls Ready to clasp me in the wildering whirls, And when it bursts, in darkness, for last breath, I shall be fighting, grappled fast with Death.â He sees an image of Martha now, with dim Wet eyes; it moves in brightness far from him. âI am like the hoary Mountain, Gray with years, and very old; And your life, a sprightly fountain, Springs, and leaves me lone and cold; Dancing, glancing on its way, Down the valleys warm and gay. âThere you go, Dear, singing, sparkling, I can see your dawn begin; While the night, around me darkling, With its death-dews, shuts me inâ Hear you singing on your way To the full and perfect day.â The suffering passes into weariness; The weariness fades into kind content: Faintly the tired heart flutters into stillness, And he has done with Age, and Want, and Illness. Gently he passed; the little Maiden wept; Sank down, o'erwearied, by the dead, and slept, With such a heavenly lustre on her face, You might have fancied Angels in the place: Companions through the day of our delight, That watch as wingÃ¨d Sentries all the night. XV. Next day a group of serious silent men Found a Dead Letter with strange life in it; It was addressed to Jesus Christ in Heaven. It called up their old hearts into their eyes, For lofty meeting in a touch of tears. At length it reached the Lady Marian, And the Boy's letter had not missed its mark. XVI. This is my Lady Marian: She walks our world, a Shining one! A Woman with an Angel-face, Sweet gravity, and tender grace; And where she treads this earth of ours, Heaven blossoms into smiling flowers. This is the Lady Marian. One of the spirits that walk in white! Many dumb hearts that sit in night, Her presence know, just as the Birds Know Morning, murmuring cheerful words. Where Life is darkest, she doth move With influence as of visible Love. This is the Lady Marian. Her coming all your being fills With a balm-breath from heaven's hills: And in her face the light is mild As though the heart within her smiled, And in her bosom sat to sing The spirit of immortal Spring. This is the Lady Marian. âWe shall not mend the world; we try, And lo, our work is vain!â they cry. With her pathetic look, she hears; You see the wounded soul bleed tears; Against the dark she sets her face, And calmly keeps her onward pace. This is the Lady Marian. One of God's treasurers for the Poor! She keepeth open heart and door. That heart a holy well of wealth, Brimming life-waters, rich with health; That door an opening you look through, To find God our side of Heaven's blue. This is the Lady Marian. XVII. From out the darkness that took shape in Her, The Lady Marian came on Christmas day, Quick with maternal tenderness of soul, Her starry smile so radiant through their night, Her hands brimful of help, as was her heart With yearnings to arise and go when first She read the letter little Fabyan sent In his confiding simpleness of faith,â One of those representatives of God Who help to make the Poor believe in Him Because He hath some living like on Earth. And Martha knows that their worst days are done; In Dora's rich sad eyes a merry light Soon dances! Lady Marian will prove A Mother, sent of God, to all the three. A trembling prayer had shook the Tree of Life, And, golden, out of heaven the fruitage falls Into their midst they think direct from God. THE BRIDEGROOM OF BEAUTY. âWho wears the Singing-Robe is richly dight,â Said MabelââHe is greater than a King,ââ Mabel, the saintly-sweet and fairily fine As Maiden rising from Enchanted Mere; A queenly creature with her quiet grace, And dazzling white hand veined cerulean: Her eyes of violet-gray were coloured rich With shade of tender thought, and mirrored large Within them starry futures swam and shone: Ah! what a smile to fill a life with light, And make the waking heart to sing in sleep!â âI would I were a Poet,â Mabel said, âUp like a Lark i' the morning of the times, To carol o'er the human harvesters; Drop fancies, dainty-sweet, to cheer their toil, And hurry out a ripe luxuriance Of life in song, as though my heart would break; To sing them sweet and precious memories, And golden promises, and throbbing hopes; Hymn the great Future with its mystery, That startles us from out the dark of time With secrets numerous as a night of stars: âThose days hung round with loftier heavens, where move The larger souls with their God-liker pace: Or send wronged Races to the battle-field With eyes that weep and burnâstir as with fire The grand wild beast of Valour, till it leapt The red Arena fiery for the fight: Then bind with flowers, or plume the Patriot's brow. Anon I would sing songs so sweetly pure, That they might pillow a budding Maiden's cheek, Like spirit-hands, and catch her tender tears; Or nestle next her heart lapt up in love:â Songs that in far lands, under alien skies, Should spring from English hearts like flowers of home; Strive to bring down a light from heaven to read The records writ on Poverty's prison walls; The signs of greatness limned in martyr blood, And make worn faces glow with warmth of love Into the lineaments of heavenly beauty. âWho wears a singing-robe is richly dight: The Poet, he is greater than a King. He plucks the veil from hidden loveliness: His gusts of music stir the shadowing boughs, To let in sunshine on the darkened soul. Upon the hills of light he plants his feet To lure the people up with harp and voice; At humblest human hearths drops dew divine To feed the violet virtues nestling there. His hands adorn the poorest house of life With rare abiding shapes of loveliness. All things obey his soul's creative eye; For him earth ripens fruit-like in the light; âGreen April comes to him with smiling tears, Like some sweet Maiden who transfigured stands In dewy light of first love's rosy dawn, And yields all secret preciousness, his Bride. He reaps the Autumn without scythe or sickle; And in the sweet low singing of the corn, Hears coming Plenty hush the pining Poor. âThe shows of things are but a robe o' the day, His life down-deepens to the living heart, And Sorrow shows him her wise mysteries. He knows this Life is but a longer year, And it will blossom bright in other springs. The soul of all things is invisible, And nearest to that soul the Poet sings; A sweet, shy Bird in darkling privacy. He beckons not the Pleasures as they pass, And lets the money-grubbing world go by. He hath a towering life, but cannot climb Out of the reach of sad calamity: A many carking cares pluck at his skirts; Wild, wandering words are hissing at his ear; He runs the gauntlet of his woes to reach The inner sanctuary of better life. But though the seas of sorrow flood his heart, Some silent spring of flowers blossoms there. His spirit-wounds a precious balsam bleed. The loveliest ministrants that visit him, Rise veiled when his heart-fountains spring in tears. And when this misty life hath rolled away The turmoil hushed; all foolish voices still; The bonds that crushed his great heart shattered down, And all his nature shines sublimely bare; Death whitens many a stain of strife and toil, And careful hands shall pluck away each weed Around the spring that wells melodious life.â Many are called, Aurelia replied, But few are crowned. I knew a Poet once; One of the world's most marvellous Might-have-beens; A strange wild harper upon human heart-strings. Life's morning-splendour round him prophesied That he should win his garland in the game. But he was lost for lack of that sweet thing, A Wife, to live his love's dear dream of beauty, And wandered darkling in his dazzling dream. Life's watersâtroubled till that Angel comesâ Never grew calm above the jewel he sought, Till in Death's harbour all their surges slept. He was betrothed to Beauty ere his birthâ That silent Spirit of the universe, Which seeks interpreters of her dumb shows, 'Mong human lovers whom she may not wed. This Spirit arose from many things, as soars The soul of Harmony from many sounds. Out of the by-way of his lonely life, She beckoned him for her Evangelist, And straightway he arose and followed her, And in the shadow of her loveliness, Or in her wake of glory, walked our world. That shining Shape, in her sweet mystery, seemed Some beauteous miracle of eternal love. Through smiles, and tears, he saw his visioned Bride, With gorgeous grace, and twinkling limbs of light, Aye dancing on in her delightsomeness. His love-dream glided silent through his life, Like rosy-handed Day 'twixt Earth and Night, And came betwixt his mind and all its glooms; Her sandals wet and fragrant with Heaven's dew. She set the barren thorns in jewelled glow, And sowed the furrows of his life with flowers. He followed with wild looks and heart a-fire, And that rich mist of feeling in the eyes, Whose alchemy half-creates the thing we see. She rose at dawn in sparkling clouds of dew, And kept the Morning's ruddy-golden gates; Stood high in sunrise on the mountain-top; Or in her bower of the ambient air Sat, shedding her rich beauty on the sea, Which of her likeness took some trembly tints; Voyaged like Venus in her car of cloud About the sapphire heaven's lake of love, Or danced on sunset streams to harp of gold: Then twilight mists would robe more dainty-rare Her dim, delicious, dreamy loveliness. The buds that startle at the voice of May And open merry eyes, had been with her; Their subtle smile said what they could reveal. She nestled glancing at him from the flower He plucked, and only caught her passing breath; Even as he grasped her vesture she was gone. Among the boughs that burgeon into bloom; The coloured clouds that kindle and richly rise From out the bosom of Earth's emerald sea; Hedge-roses set in dewy radiance green; The lush Laburnums, all a rain of gold; She seemed to have fled and left her robe afloat. An Ariel now, she murmured in the Pines; He heard, but had no magic word or wand. A wavy Naiad, she rippled the cool brooks That round her dallied, babbling in their dreams. The fragrant feeling of the languorous air Was as the soft endearment of her arms, That wound him in a tremulous caress. Not by appointment do we meet Delight And Joy; they heed not our expectancy; But round some corner in the streets of life, They, on a sudden, clasp us with a smile. So on him rose his visitant divine, From many a magic mirror of the mind; With elfin evanescence came and went. When, thronged with life, the Year in beauty burst, Lifted her lids, and blossomed from the trees, She glanced from all the gateways of the spring. In burnished bark swam down the summer-tide That floods the valleys, breaks o'er all the hills, In sparkling spray of flowers, and leafy life. She roofed the Autumn forests with the wealth Of melted rainbows, caught from summer heaven. And winter trees stretched fingers weird to win The perfect pearl of her white purity. Where'er she went Earth looked up and was glad. Through Music's maze she glode at hide-and-seek; Played with the Storm, then in her Iris-shape Laughed from the purple skirts of Heaven, as laughs Some radiant Child from Mother's hiding robe. Adown dim forest-windings he would peer; Surprise his Beautiful at her woodland bath, And in a solemn hush of heart stand still Like fixÃ¨d flame! for lo, how softly glowed Her dainty limbs in depths of dissolved pearl! Then swift as runs a wind-wave over grass, He saw her garments gleam in leafy light. Were those love-whisperings among the leaves, Or elvish laughters twitting through the trees? Sometimes the boughs let in her haunting face; But the old Forest kept the secret still, And hushed it round with grave unconscious look. In vernal nights so tender, calm, and cool, When eerie Darkness lays its shadowy hands On Earth, and reads her sins with searching eyes, Like a Confessor o'er a kneeling Nun; He stood in God's wide whispering-gallery, And breathed his worship: down from visible heaven Her influence fell, and thrilled in music through The silences of space, and soothed his soul, Till life was folded up brimful of beauty, As the flower clasps its pearl and droops to dream. At times, from out the curtains of the dark, Her face would meet him through the glowing gloom. Sometimes she passed; her rippling raiment touched His sense, and sphered him with diviner air, Like honeysuckles brushed at dewy dusk. The fragrance of her breath made old earth young. From mystery to mystery, like a Bride, The dainty-waisted darling led him on, And dropped love-tokens in his pilgrim path. The red Rose peering from its cool green leaves Like warm Love lifting half its hiding veil, Symbolled her soft red mouth held up to him. A virgin whiteness in a dream of bloom, Gave to her tender cheeks their taking tint. Her eyes were orbs of thought that on him burned Fervent as Hesper in the brow of night. He walked as in a clime of golden eves. The vineyard of his life reeled lusty-ripe; He ached to press the wine upon her lips, But aye she melted from his love's embrace, To float him far away in faÃ«ry lands. The wooing wind would murmur of her fairness, And round him breathe in many whispers sweet; Bring dews of healing as from Hermon hill; Creep to his burning heart with drink of life, And cool him with her kisses. Oft he hushed, As one who pauses on a midnight heath, To catch the footfall felt by Fancy's ear. When he awoke in Dreamland, 'twas to find He had been floated through some starry dark Far from earth's shore, on an enchanted sea: And he lay pillowed 'twixt her white warm breasts, In glowing arms of glorifying love: A light of love-dreams on her features shone, And she had laid her daylight mask aside; All the sweet soul of things bare to him, as lies The mirrored moon in silver sleeping seas. A shimmering splendour from the By-gone broke, As the Ship leaves a luminous wake behind; And, looking back, his Childhood's world she ringed With rich auroral hues of summer dawns. When weird, dark shapes of sorrow hunted nigh With their slow solemn eyes, and silent aim, She dropped the gold cloud of her tresses round him. When o'er him hung the night of adverse fate, She was a light along his perilous path, And through the darkness of his soul there broke A heaven of worlds all tenderness and peace. At times he walked with glad and dauntless step, As inner wings to heroic music moved; And men who read his lighted look might deem His life a summer story told in flowers. But often he would falter weeping-weak, With claspÃ¨d hands, and very lowly heart. Then she rose radiant in a finer light, Seen through the altar-smoke and mist of tears. So his life grew to beauty silently, And shaped his soul into an orb of song. He sang of Her his beautiful Unknown! And to his music she would coyly come; He ceasedâto look on herâand she was gone. He sang of Her his beautiful Unknown, Heart-wild, as some glad bird that tells of spring, He would have made the world her worshipper, And all Earth's voices ring a rich refrain. One day our passionate pilgrim sat him down By the wayside of life, and thus he prayedâ âO thou BelovÃ¨d! O thou Beautiful! On our perfection throned for pedestal: O Spirit as the lightning wild and bright, Come from thy palace of the purple light! Come down to mortal arms a living form, With heavenly height of brow, and bosom warm. Glow human from the mist, thou Shape of Grace; Thou tender wonder, fold me face to face. Art thou not mine, thou delicate Delight? Hast thou not visited me noon and night? Freighted with my dead Hopes I follow thee, Like some Norse Sea-king flaming out to sea. Say, are the pleasant bowers far away, Decked by thy dear hands for our Marriage-day, Where we the gardens of delight shall roam In endless love? Now wilt thou lead me home, To find our bliss in heaven's honied heart; Live secret soul to soul, never to part? âO awful Glory, felt, but nowhere found, I have but seen thy Shadow on life's ground. I know thee now, Immortal! show the way To thine Elysium, I would die to-day. Break into wings this chrysalis of my life, That I may soar to thee my spirit-wife. Thy dark bower-door, the Grave, gives me no fear; When I emerge beyond, thou wilt be near.â O'er all his face a light of glory smiled, His soul had rent the veil 'twixt life and life. Slowly the shining vapours orb a Star, By fine degrees before his fixÃ¨d eyes. The Spirit he had sought through all the world,â Had sought without but only found within,â Turned full upon him face to face at last. She laid her hand upon his throbbing harp; She pressed her lips upon his passionate life; And both stood still. In death he had found his Bride. POEMS FOR CHRISTIE. A WINTER'S TALE FOR THE LITTLE ONES. A merry sound of clapping hands, A call to see the sight; And lo! the first soft snow-flakes fall, So exquisitely virginal: 'Tis my wee Nell at window stands, And the world is all in white. Her eyes, where dawns my bluest Day, Dance with the dancing snow! I see delicious shivers thrill Her through and through. She feels the chill Of Earth so white, and skies so gray Enrich our fireside glow. âNo Winters now, my little Maid, Like those that used to come, Making our Christmas sparkle, bright As crystallized plum-cake at night, And Frost his Puck-like trickeries played, With fancies frolicsome. âHe fixed your breath in flowers, the Trees To Chandeliers would turn: He pinched your toes, he nipped your nose, He made your cheek a wrinkled Rose: Perhaps at night you heard him sneeze, And the Jug was cracked at morn! âThe Snow-Storms were magnificent! And in the clear, still weather Against the bitter wintry blue And Sunset's orange-tawny hue You saw the smoke straight upward went, For weeks and weeks together. âAt night the Waits mixed with our dream Their music sweet and low: We children knew not as we heard, Each, listening, nestled like a Bird, Whether from Heaven the music came, Or only over the snow! âNo winters now-a-days like those.â And then my darling tries To coax me for a âtale that's true: A story that is newâquite new.â And up the arch of wonder goes, Above the frank, blue eyes! âOnce on a timeâââDo tell me when, And where?â says my wee Nellâ âWhen Christmas came on Thursdayânow, Some five-and-thirty years ago! Superbly we were snowed-up then, Who lived in Ingle Dell. âHis icy Drawbridge Winter dropped; The running springs he froze; The Roads were lost; the hedges crossed; All field-work ceased through the âLong Frost.â But there was one thing never stoppedâ That was Grandmother's nose! âThe snow might fall by day, by night, The weather wax more rough, And up to our bedroom windows heap The drift, and smother men like sheep, And wrap the world in a shroud of whiteâ Old Gran must have her snuff! âSo Uncle Willie, then a lad Not more than nine years old, Upon the Christmas morn must go And fetch her snuff, and face the Snow, Which surely had gone dancing mad, And wrestle with the cold. âWrapped in his crimson Comforter, His basket on his arm, He started. Mother followed him With her proud eyes so dewy-dim; While kisses from the heart of her Within his heart were warm. âHow gentle is the gracious Snow, When first you watch her dance; Her feathery flutter, winding whorls; Her finish perfect as the pearl's; She looks you in the face as though 'Twere unveiled Innocence. âBut now, 'tis wild upon the waste, And winged upon the wind: You see, just passing out of sight, The Ghost of things in a swirl of white!â The Storm unwinkingly he faced, Though it snowed enough to blind. âFire-pointed, stinging, strikes and burns To the bone, each icy dart. He stumblesâfallsâis up again, And onward for the Town a-strain; Backward our Willie never turns, And never loses heart. âHe looks a weird and wintry Elf With face in ruddy glow; And all his curls are straightened out, Hanging in Icicles about A sparkling statue of himself, Shaped out of frozen snow. âHe still fought on, for though the Storm Might bend him, he was tough; And when the Blast would take his breath, With kisses like the kiss of death, One thought still kept his courage warmâ It was Grandmother's Snuff! âAt length with many a danger passed, Unboding worse to come, He has got the Snuff. Far more than food, Or wine, 'twill warm her poor old blood. He has it safe at last, at last! And sets his face for Home. âHe has the Snuff; but it were well If Granny had it too! For early closes such a day, And wild and dreary is the way; If dark before he reach the Dell, What can poor Willie do? âWithin the Town the blast is hushed; The snow-flakes from you melt: But out upon the pathless moor, The storm grows madder than before; And at him all its furies rushed, Till he faint and fainter felt. âHis thoughts are whirling with the Snow: His eyes get dizzy and dim! And on the path, 'twixt him and night, Now dancing left, now dancing right, It seems a white Witch-Woman doth go, With white hand beckoning him! âTo the last stile he clungâmaybe A furlong from our door; Then missed his footing on the plank, And deep into the snow-drift sank. O, my belovÃ¨d Willie, we Shall never see you more! âAh, they looked long and wistfully Who waiting sat at home: At every sound they leaned to hark; They strained their eyes through the depeening dark, And wondered where could Willie be, And when would Willie come? âThrough all that night of wild affright They searched the road to Town; They called him high, they called him low, They mocked each other through the snow, And all the night, by lanthorn light, They wandered up and down. âThey sought him where the waters plash Darkly by Deadman's Cave! They sought him at the Rag-Pit, near The Mill, and by the awesome Weir; At the Cross-Roads where âHarry's Ashâ Grows from the Suicide's Grave. âIn Ingle Dell they locked no door, Put out no light. At such A time you cling to a little thing That's done for neighbourly comforting! Old Gran thought she would snuff no more, And she took thrice as much. âAll night the Snow with fingers soft Kept pointing to the ground. Only too well they knew 'twas there; But had no hint to guide them where! And he so near. They passed him oft, Close by his white grave-mound. âAnd did he die?â cries little Nell. âNo, he was nestled warm. The Snow's white arm that round him curled Had caught him into another world: What other world he could not tell, But, out of all the storm. âAnd all was changed too suddenly For him to know the place. He swooned awhile, and when he woke A lightning from his darkness broke; Alone with the Eternal he Seemed standing face to face! âThere in his grave alive, he knew He stood, or sat upright! With burning brain, and freezing feet: And he so young, and life so sweet; And, bitter thought! what would Gran do Without her snuff that night? âA long, long night of sixty hours Did Willie pass. I know Not how he lived. But Heaven can hold A life as safe as Earth can fold Her hidden life of fruit and flowers, Through her long trance of snow. â'Tis Sabbath day. How quietly gleams That snow-drift o'er him driven! The winds are softly laid asleep, In their white snow-bed covered deep. The white Clouds all so still! it seems Like Sunday up in Heaven! âThe Country-folk are passing near His tombâno tale it tellsâ Old Ploughmen in their white smockfrocks, Old Women in long scarlet cloaks, And Lad and Lass,âwhen on his ear There faints a sound of Bells! âAnd, looking up, a tiny hole Was melted with his breath; Where-through a bit of God's blue sky Was smiling on him like an Eye; A living eye with a loving soul Shone in that face of death! âO joy! He shouted from his grave, And finding room to stir, He tooth and nail began to climb; He clutched the top o' the bank this time; Thrust his hand through the snow to wave His good old Comforter! ââI'm here!â âIt's me!â His flag they see, And know lost Willie's voice; They quickly answer shout for shout, And with their hands they dig him out, And carry him home. Oh! didn't we In Ingle Dell rejoice? âThere be some tears that smile, and such Were wept by Woman and Man. But while they glistened in each eye, He pulled the snuff out sound and dry; Snow might cover him, cold might clutch, The Snuff was safe for Gran.â FOR CHRISTIE'S SAKE. Upon us falls the shadow of night, And darkened is our day! My Love will greet the morning light Four hundred miles away. God love her! torn so swift and far From hearts so like to break! And God love all who are good to her; For Christie's sake. I know whatever spot of ground In any land we treadâ I know the eternal arms are round; That heaven is overhead, And faith the mourning heart will heal; But many fears will make Our spirits faint, our fond hearts kneel, For Christie's sake. Good-bye, Dear! be they kind to you As though you were their ain! My Daisy opens to the dew, But shuts against the rain! Never will New Moon glad our eyes But offerings we shall make To old God Wish! and prayers will rise For Christie's sake. Four years ago we struck our tent; O'er homeless Babes we yearned; Our allâthree darlingsâwith us went, But only two returned! While life yet bleeds into Her grave Love ventures one more stake; Hush, hush, poor Hearts! if big, be brave, For Christie's sake. Like Crown to most ambitious brows Was Christie to us given; To make our Home a holy house, And nursery of heaven! O softer was her bed of rest. Than lily's on the lake; Peace filled so deep each billowy breast, For Christie's sake. To music played by Harps and Hands Invisible, were we drawn O'er charmÃ¨d seas, through faÃ«ry lands, Under a rosier dawn! We entered our new world of love With blessings in our wake, While prospering Heavens smiled above For Christie's sake. We gazed with proud eyes luminous On such a gift of graceâ All heaven narrowed down to us In one dear little face! And many a pang we felt, dear Wife, With hurt of heart and ache, All shut within like clasping knife, For Christie's sake. I would no tears might e'er run down Her patient face, beside Such happy pearls of heart as crown Young Motherânew-made Bride! For 'tis a face that, looking up To passing Heaven, might make An Angel stop, a blessing drop, For Christie's sake. If Love in that child's heart of hers Should breathe and break its calm With trouble sweet as that which stirs The brooding buds of balm,â Listening at ear of peeping pearl Glistening in eyes that shake Their sweet dew down! God bless our Girl; For Christie's sake. But, Father! if our Babe must mourn, Be merciful and kind; And if our gentle Lamb be shorn, Attemper Thou the wind! Across the Deluge guide our Dove, And to Thy bosom take With arm of love, and shield above, For Christie's sake. We have had sorrows many and strange. Dear Christie! when I'm gone, Some of my words will weirdly change If she read sadly on! Lightnings, from what was dark of old, With meanings strange will break Of troubles hid or dimly told For Christie's sake. Wife! we should still try hard to win The best for our dear Child; And keep a resting-place within, When all without grows wild. As on the winter graves the snow Falls softly flake by flake, Our love should whitely clothe our woe, For Christie's sake. For one will wake at midnight drear From out a dream of death, And find no dear head pillowed near; No sound of peaceful breath! May no weak wailing words arise, No bitter thoughts awake To see the tears in Memory's eyes: For Christie's sake. And There! where many crownless kings Of earth a crown shall wear,â The Martyrs who have borne the pangs Their palm at last shall bear, When, with our lily pure of sin, Our homeward way we take;â There, may we walk with welcome in; For Christie's sake. CHRISTIE'S PORTRAIT. Your tiny picture makes me yearn; We are so far apart! My Darling, I can only turn And kiss you in my heart. A thousand tender thoughts a-wing Swarm in a summer clime, And hover round it murmuring Like bees at honey-time. Upon a little girl I look Whose pureness makes me sad; I read as in a holy book, I grow in secret glad! It seems my darling comes to me With something I have lost Over life's tossed and troubled sea, On some celestial coast. I think of her when spirit-bowed; A glory fills the place! Like sudden light on swords, the proud Smile flashes in my face; And others see, in passing by, But cannot understand The vision shining in mine eye, My strength of heart and hand. That grave content and touching grace Bring tears into mine eyes; She makes my heart a holy place Where hymns and incense rise! Such calm her gentle spirit brings Asâsmiling overheadâ White statued saints with peaceful wings Shadow the sleeping dead. Our Christie is no rosy Grace With beauty all may see; But I have never felt a face Grow half so dear to me. No curling hair about her brows, Like many merry girls; Well, straighter to my heart it goes, And round it curls and curls. Meek as the wood-anemone glints To see if skies are blue, Is my pale flower with her tints Of heaven shining through! She will be poor and never fret, Sleep sound and lowly lie; Will live her quiet life, and let The great world-storm go by! Dear love! God keep her in His grasp, Meek maiden, or brave wife, Till His good Angels softly clasp Her closÃ¨d book of life; And this true picture of the Sun, With birthday blessings given, Shall fade before a glorious one Taken of her in heaven. THE TWO HEAVENS. There are two Heavens for natures clear And calm as thine, my gentle Love! One Heaven but reflected here; One Heaven that waits above: As yonder Lake, in Evening's red, Lies smiling with the smile of Rest; One Heaven glowing overhead; One mirrored in its breast. SLEEP-WALKING. Oft in the night I am with you, Dear! I lean and listen your breathing to hear; Little you dream of any one near. No one knoweth that I am gone; Curtains closely about me drawn, When dreams dissolve at a touch of Dawn! Nobody meets me under the sky, Only the staring Owl goes by Softly as though the night should sigh. Under the moonlight, over the moss! I need no bridge the river to cross, Though winds awake and waters toss. O sweet, so sweet the Nightingale's strain! Is it her pleasure that works us pain, Or her pain that with pleasure pierces the brain? Window or door I pass not through: The way I never could show to you By day. I enter as spirits do! There you are! lying cheek-on-palm, Drinking of slumber's dewiest calm, Brimming your life with the rosiest balm. The little wee bird that beats in the breast, Hath folded its wings in a wee white nest, Breathing the fulness of innermost rest. But the other nightâsee my blushes bloomâ Somehow I missed my way in the gloom, And, thinking myself quite safe in your room, I nestled my face, as I thought, in your bed To kiss you, andânow let me hide my headâ I kissedâI kissedâyour Teacher instead. CHRISTIE'S POOR OLD GRAN. No green age, beautiful to see, Hath Poor Old Gran! No ripe life mellowed goldenly Hath Poor Old Gran! One by one we have left her fold, Her lonely hearth is growing cold, Faint is her smile as the primrose gold, Our Poor Old Gran! Ah! whitened face,and withered form, Of Poor Old Gran! Beaten and blanched in many a storm: Poor Old Gran! She hath wept the bitter tears that sow The dark grave-violets in the snow Where once the red young rose did glow! Poor Old Gran! There's few have lived a harder lot, Poor Old Gran! But she toiled on and murmured not; Poor Old Gran! For us she toiled on starvingly, And fought the wolf of poverty; Upon her heart's blood suckled me, Our Poor Old Gran! Her river of life hath roughly rolled; Poor Old Gran! A Wreck lies dark, its tale untold, Poor Old Gran! Yet shall her old heart laugh with ye, My Bird's-nest in the mouldering tree! And soft in heaven the bed shall be For poor Old Gran! The grip of Poverty is grim; Poor Old Gran! Lustres of lip and eye will dim; Poor Old Gran! But through the frailty of her face There gleams a light of tender grace, Or else I see through a tearful haze Poor Old Gran! You came in all our sorrowings, Poor Old Gran! How your weakness hurried on wings, Poor Old Gran! You stood at Bridal, Birth, and Bier: Our darlings dead and gone seem near When you are near, and make more dear Our Poor Old Gran! So come to our Cottage up the lane, Poor Old Gran! Follow our fortune's harvest-wain, Poor Old Gran! We'll shelter you from wind and rain, Hunger you shall not know again, Plenty shall smile away your pain, Poor Old Gran! And little laughing Stars shall rise On Poor Old Gran! In the clear heaven of Childhood's eyes, For Poor Old Gran! Wee fingers, stroking her gray hair, Shall almost melt the hoarfrost there, Wee lips shall kiss away the care From Poor Old Gran! So come and sit beside our hearth, Poor Old Gran! Come from the darkness and the dearth, Poor Old Gran! And you shall be our fireside guest, And weary heart and head will rest; And your last days shall be your best, Our Poor Old Gran. NEWS OF CHRISTIE. We read your Letters! no word lost; All, all is rememberÃ¨d; And often when there comes no Post, Once more are the old ones read. Of all she did we love to hear, And how the days have sped; But to our listening hearts most dear Is something âChristie said.â LITTLE WILLIE. Poor little Willie, With his many pretty wiles; Worlds of wisdom in his look And quaint, quiet smiles; Hair of amber, touched with Gold of heaven so brave; All lying darkly hid In a Workhouse Grave! In the day we wandered foodless, Little Willie cried for bread! In the night we wandered homeless, Little Willie cried for bed. Parted at the Workhouse door, Not a word we said: Ah, so tired was poor Willie, And so sweetly sleep the dead. You remember little Willie; Such a funny fellow! he Sprang like a lily From the dirt of poverty. Poor little Willie! Not a friend was nigh, When, from the cold world, He crouched down to die. 'Twas in the dead of winter We laid him in the earth; The world brought in the New Year, Mocking us with mirth: But, for lost little Willie, Not a tear we crave; Cold and Hunger cannot wake him, In his Workhouse Grave. We thought him beautiful, Felt it hard to part; We to him were dutiful; Down, down, poor heart! The storms they may beat; The winter winds may rave; Little Willie feels not In his Workhouse Grave. No room for little Willie; In the world he had no part; On him stared the Gorgon-eye, Through which looks no heart. Come to me, said Heaven; And, if Heaven will save, We will grieve not, though the door Was a Workhouse Grave. WHEN CHRISTIE COMES AGAIN. When the merry spring-tide Floods all the land; Nature hath a Mother's heart, Gives with open hand; Flowers running up the lane Tell us May is near: Christie will be coming then! Christie will be here! O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. Pure is her meek nature, Clear as morning dew, We can see the Angel Almost shining through. To Earth's sweetest blessing She the best from Heaven did bring; Good Genius of our Love-lamp; Fine Spirit of the Ring! O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. All our joys we'll tell her, But for her dear sake, Not a word of sorrow, Lest her little heart should ache. She shall dance and swing and sing, Do as she likes best; Only I must have her hand In ramble or in rest. O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. We'll romp in jewelled meadows, Hunt in dingles cool with leaves, Where all night the Nightingale Melodiously grieves. In her cheek so tender The shy and dainty rose Shall colour, and come for kisses, To every wind that blows. O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. Hope will lay so many eggs In her little nest; Doesn't your heart run over, Christie, in your breast? Thinking how we'll greet you Safe once more at home, Ours will run to meet you, Often ere you come. O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. O the joy in our house, Hearts dancing wild! Christie will be coming soon, She's our darling child. Holy dew of heaven In each eyelid starts, Feeling all her dearness, Darling of all hearts. O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. Dreary was our winter; Come! and all the place Shall breathe a summer sweetness, And wear a happy face; There will be a sun-smile On stern, old Calaby, Tender as the spring-gold On our old Oak-Tree! O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. Jack, the Dog, will run before, First to reach the Rail; Jack, the Pony, whisk you home, With long trotting tail! We have had our struggles, dear, But couldn't part with Jack; We shall all be waiting there, To welcome Christie back! O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again. Then blow you Winds, and shake up The sleeping flower-beds! Make the Violets wake up, The Daisies lift their heads; The Lilacs float in fragrance, Dim-purple, saintly-white! And bring the bonny bairn to us, The flower of our delight. O the merry spring-tide! We'll be glad in sun or rain, In the merry, merry, merry days When Christie comes again, CHILDREN AT PLAY. âOpen your mouth and shut your eyes,â Three little Maidens were saying,â âAnd see what God sends you!â little they thought Who listened while they were playing! So little we guess that a light light word At times may be more than praying. âI,â said Kate with the merry blue eyes, âWould have lots of frolic and folly;â âI,â said Ciss with the bonnie brown hair, âWould have life always smiling and jolly;â âAnd I would have just what our Father may send,â Said lovable little pale Polly. Life came for the Two, with sweetnesses new Each morning in gloss and in glister: But the Father above, in a longing of love, Caught up little Polly and kissed her. And the Churchyard nestled another wee grave; The Angels another wee Sister. LITTLE LILYBELL. When unseen fingers part the leaves, To show us beauty's face; And Earth her breast of glory heaves, And glows from Spring's embrace: Flowers Fairy-like on coloured wings Float up,âLife's sea doth swell And flush a world of vernal things, Came little Lilybell. And like a blessed Bird of calm Our love's sweet want she stilled; Made Passion's fiery wine run balm,â Life's glory half fulfilled! From dappled dawn to twinkling dark, Our witching Ariel Moves through our heaven! O, like a lark Sings little Lilybell! And she is fairâay, very fair! With eyes so like the dove; And lightly leans her world of care Upon our arms of love! It cannot be that ye will break The promise-tale ye tell; Ye will not make such fond hearts ache, Our little Lilybell! As on Life's stream her leaflets spread, And tremble in its flow, We shudder lest the awful Dead Pluck at her from below! Breathe faint and low, ye winds that start; O stream, but softly swell; Your every motion smites the heart For little Lilybell! We tremble lest the Angel Death, Who comes to gather flowers For Paradise, at her sweet breath Should fall in love with ours! O, many a year will come and go, Ere from Life's mystic well Such stream shall flow, such flower shall blow, As little Lilybell! Ah, when her dear heart fills with fears, And aches with Love's sweet pain, And pale cheeks burn through happy tears, Like red rose in the rain! I marvel, Sweet, if we shall see The sight, and say 'tis well, When the Beloved calls for thee, Our dainty Lilybell! How rich Love made the lowly sod, Where such a flower hath blown! O Love, we love, and think that God Is such a love full-grown! Dear God! that gave the blessed trust, Be near, that all be well; And morn and eve bedew our dust, For love of Lilybell! OUR WHITE DOVE. A white Dove out of glory flew, White as the whitest shape of Grace That nestles in the soft embrace Of heaven when skies are summer blue! It came with dew-drop purity, On glad wings of the morning light, And sank into our life, so white A Vision! sweetly, secretly! Silently nestled our white Dove: Balmily made our bosoms swim With still delight, and overbrim; The air it breathed was breath of love. Our Dove had eyes of baby-blue, Soft as the speedwell's by the way, That looked up to us as they would say, âWho kissed me while I slept, did you?â God love it! but we took our Bird, And loved it well, and merry made; We sang and danced around, or prayed In silence, wherein hearts are heard. It seemed to come from far green fields To meet us over life's rough sea, With leaf of promise from the tree In which a dearer nest it builds. As fondling Mother-birds will pull The softest feathers from their breast, We gave our best to line the nest And make it warm and beautiful! We held it as the leaves of life In hidden silent service fold About a Rose's heart of gold, So jealous of all outer strife! When holy sleep in soothing palms Pillowed the darling little head, How lightly moved we round the bed, And felt the silence fall in balms! But all we did or tried to do, Our flood of joy it never felt; Only into our hearts would melt Still deeper those dove-eyes of blue. Quick with the spirit of field and wood, All other Birds would chirrup and sing Till hearts did ripple and homes did ring: Our white Dove only cooed and cooedâ With every day some sweetness new, And night and day and day and night It was the voice of our delight, That gentle, low, endearing coo! God! if we were to lose our child! O, we must die, poor hearts would cry: She looked on us so hushingly; So mournfully to herself she smiled. One day she pined up in our face With a low cry we could not still, A moaning we might never heal, For sleep in some more quiet place. We could not help and yet must see The little head droop wearily, The little eyes shine eerily, My Dove! what have they done to thee? The look grew pleading in her eyes, And mournful as the lonesome light That in a window burns all night, Asking for stillness, while one dies. The hand of Death so coldly clings, So strongly draws the weak life-wave Into his dark, vast, silent cave; Our little Dove must use its wings! And so it sought the dearer nest; A little way across the sea It kept us wingÃ¨d company, Then fled into its leafier rest, And suddenly left us long to feel A sadness in the sweetest words, A broken heartstring 'mid the chords; A tone more tremulous when we kneel. But, dear my Christie, do not cry, Our White Dove gave for you and me Such blessed promise as must be Perfected in the heavens high. Our Bird of God but soars and sings: Oft when life's heaving wave's at rest, She makes her mirror in my breast, I feel a winnowing of wings, And meekly doth she minister Glad thoughts of comfort, thrills of pride; She makes me feel that if I died This moment I should go to her. Be good! and you shall find her where No wind can shake the wee bird's nest; No dreams can break the wee bird's rest; No night, no pain, no parting there! No echoes of old storms gone by! Earth's sorrows slumber peacefully; The weary are at rest, and He Shall wipe the tears from every eye. POOR ELLEN. 'Tis hard to die in Spring-time, When, to mock our bitter need, All life around runs over In its fulness without heed: New life for tiniest twig on tree, New worlds of honey for the bee, And not one drop of dew for me Who perish as I plead. 'Tis hard to die in Spring-time, When it stirs the poorest clod; The wee Wren lifts its little heart In lusty songs to God; And Summer comes with conquering march; Her banners waving 'neath the arch Of heaven, where I lie and parchâ Left dying by the road. 'Tis hard to die in Spring-time, When the long blue days unfold, And cowslip-coloured sunsets Grow, like Heaven's own heart, pure gold! Each breath of balm brings wave on wave Of new life that would lift and lave My Life, whose feel is of the grave, And mingling with the mould. But sweet to die in Spring-time, When these lustres of the sward, And all the breaks of beauty Wherewith Earth is daily starr'd, For me are but the outside show, All leading to the inner glow Of that strange world to which I goâ For ever with the Lord. O sweet to die in Spring-time, When I reach the promised Rest, And feel His arm is round meâ Know I sink back on His breast: His kisses close these poor dim eyes; Soon I shall hear Him say âArise,â And, springing up with glad surprise, Shall know Him and be blessed. 'Tis sweet to die in Spring-time, For I feel my golden year Of summer-time eternal Is beginning even here! âPoor Ellen!â now you say and sigh, âPoor Ellen!â and to-morrow I Shall say âPoor Mother!â and, from the sky, Watch you, and wait you there. THE NABOB'S DOUBLE. Has Man a spirit that's more than breath, A spirit that walks in sleep or in death; Shakes off at will its dust of the earth, And, waking by night, goes wandering forth To work its wish with a noiseless tread, While the body lies bound full-length in bed? This is the fact, as sure as fate, For Burglar Bill, and his midnight mate, That frightened until it converted him, To join the âSalvation Armyâ with Jim. Many a âcribâ had the couple âcrackedâ; Large was their luck with the swag they sacked. Many a time thought Burglar Bill, âOld Nabob's looks very lone on the hill!â But, there was the Dog whose infernal bark Could be heard through a mile of solid dark. One day it was rumoured that âKeeperâ was dead. To himself Bill knowingly nodded his head, âTo-night or never,â he cunningly said. That night up-hill the couple crept, To rifle his store as the rich man slept. All heaven mirrored, with stars agleam, The dazzle of diamonds in their dream! They entered their treasuryâstruck a lightâ A tiny lightâbut it showed a sight To make the Burglar's heart turn white! The Nabob sitting alone in his chair, Facing them there with his long white hair, And his eyes wide open with corpse-like stare. And close by his side, keeping watch and ward, The statue as 'twere of a dog on guard, With mouth agape, but never a bark; The dog that was dead and stiff and stark; Threatening them as if in life! Jim rushed at the old man with his knife, And drove it right throughâan empty chair, Instead of the figure sitting there. For the Nabob vanished, dog and all,â And the burglars vanished without their haul. Meanwhile, at the moment he felt the stroke, Upstairs in bed the Nabob woke. âOh wife! are you here? Am I dead? is it night? Oh wife! I have suffered an unked fright! I dreamed I was dozing below in my chair, When suddenly, helplessly, I was aware, In the dead of the night there was life in the gloom; Then a lightâand two masked men in the room: One of them dealt me a murderous blow, AndâI woke from my dream in the room below. But this, O my God! was the strangest thing, âKeeperâ was with me; I saw him spring: Swift as the flash of the falling knife He flew at the Thief as he would in life!â Only a dream! but they went down-stair, And there were the burglar's tools, and there Was the knife stuck fast in its stab of the chair! THE DIAKKA. You are the Merry men, dwarfs of soul, Who can get your hand through the tiniest hole, And make your bells jingle outside of the show; Prove there's life beyond, and on that we go! 'Tis trying to find that we are more near To you than to those we have held more dear, But I think they are backing you all the while; And down on our efforts benignly may smile To see how we strive and are ever unable To meet and shake hands with the leg of a table. So holloa, boys, ring the bells, let them see how You can wake up the world with your row-de-dow. Folk say you are Devils: then act as such! Give them a touch of the devil's clutch. In times like ours 'tis a comfort to know For certain there may be a devil or so! We need them to prove how the lusts of old For women or wine, for gore or gold, Are not to be quenched with their burning breath By the waters of Winter that drown us in death, But still live on, all a-crave to be fed In the earth-life lived by the homeless dead. Holloa, boys, ring the bells, let us see how You can wake up the world with your row-de-dow. Many a fathom deep under the ground Souls like toads in the rock lie bound, Awaiting the resurrection sound Of the Crack of doom, for them to be found! Nothing short of an earthquake-kick Will send them heavenward, make them quick. Spirits far off, invisible, mute, Can no more reach to the buried root, Than we upon earth to the moon can shoot, Or open oysters by playing a flute! Holloa, boys, ring the bells, show them how You can wake up the world with your row-de-dow. âTHEY SANG A NEW SONG.â Gather round the Table, When the day is done; Lay the Electric Cable That weds two Worlds in one. We have found the passage Past the frozen pole; We have had the Message Answering, soul to soul. Gather round the Table In a fervent band: Learn the Lost are able To join us hand in hand With ties no longer riven: Empty in the Past Stretched our hands toward Heavenâ They are filled at last. Gather round the Table: The silent and the meek, So long belied, are able For themselves to speak, Open but a portal: Every Spirit saith, Man is born immortal, And there is no death. Gather round the Table: By knowledge faith is fed! Ours the fact they fable; Presence is the Bread. Come with cleanliest carriage, Whitely-pure be dressed: For this Heavenly Marriage, Earth should wear its best. FLOWER AND FRUIT. The flower you placed within my button-hole Has faded; but there lives within my soul Another rose, unfolding hour by hourâ Your beauty's self in its immortal flower. So living-warm this dainty blossom blows, As if a sunbeam blushed into a Rose, To make me rich with its ungathered wealth, And happy in the glory of its health; With fragrance like a waft from heaven afar, And look as lustrous as the morning star. I do not come to crown your beauty, Sweet! Nor thank you for it, kneeling at your feet; But pray that on Love's bosom it may rest, As thornless as its likeness in my breast; And ask Him who such promise here hath given To let me see the Flower fulfilled in heaven. PEGASUS IN HARNESS. They pity Pegasus because The Matrimonial Car he draws Along the ruts of life: And hot and dusty is the road, And heavy is the living load Of leaning weans and wife. Poor Pegasus! to turn the Mill, And grind, and pull the plough until The work his withers wrings! Why not? 'tis he should do it best, And tread his measure easiest, Or where's the use of wings? LOVE AND DEATH. This butterfly of human breath, Is followed far and fast by Death; Some flower of life it settled on He clasps and crushes, butâ'tis gone. ORPHANS. Who would not wish the Dead were near, If we can dry the mourners' tear? Who would not pray the Dead may sleep, When starving Orphans wake to weep? ONE OF SHAKSPEARE'S WOMEN. I sometimes think that Shakspeare has revealed To me that very self so long concealed: But if his soul my soul has lightened through, I sometimes think it was to gaze on you, To find, with loving wonder in his looks, One of his Women living out of his Books! IMPERFECTION. Ah, never is the Almighty Artist's plan Crowned and completed in the life of man. At best a broken fragment we up-rear Above the tomb, that like a visible prayer Pleads on and ever with the Infinite, For other lives to come and finish it, And for the eternal temple make it fit. SO IT GOES. The tender green that laughs out in the light, And drinks the freshness of the dew and rain, Must take the cloud of dust that turns it white And burnish every tiny blade again! The river into which heaven cometh down, It is so exquisitely pure and still, Must also soil itself to cleanse the town, And with hard labour tread and turn the mill. GROWING OLD. The stream of Life that brimmed its banks of old, We drain to gather Wisdom's grains of gold; And often as we count the riches o'er, Half wish our wealth were drowned in it once more! A GREEK REPLY. âSo many are your foes, their arrows shroud The very Sun with an eclipsing cloud.â âWe'll fight them in the dark then! and the horde Illumine with the lightning of the Sword.â MAN AND HIS TWO MASTERS. âYou cannot serve two Masters,â saith the Word. But Satan nudges us and whispers, âGammon! You lend your Womenkind to love the Lord, And give Yourselves to serve and worship Mammon.â WOMANKIND. Dear things! we would not have you learn too muchâ Your Ignorance is so charming! We've a notion That greater knowledge might not lend you such Sure aid to blind obedience and devotion. A VERY EARLY RISER. At the Last Day while all the rest Are soundly sleeping underground, He will be up clean-shaved and dressed An hour before the Trumpets sound. A PECULIAR PERSON. You perfect, pure, original, Writ in a tongue unknown to all; Translated, in some other sphere, You may be read; but will not here. DELIA BACON. The Delian diver wrecked her life to grasp A pearl she saw by Visionary gleams, And died with empty hand that could not clasp The treasure only Real in her dreams. A PAINTED SPRAY OF APPLE-BLOSSOM. Throughout the year and year by year will bloom This blush of Spring arrested in my room, Whilst Nature's self to rival it must bring Her breathing buds renewed each passing Spring. AN ANGEL IN THE HOUSE. You have your Angel in the House! but look On this, her likeness, mirrored in a book, If but to learn how shadowy the Ideal In presence of the living, loving Real. SOULS OF ANIMALS. Such look of an immortal likeness springs, At times into the eyes of dear dumb things, As if Hereafter we must recognize The Unknown Life that knew us in their eyes. TRUE POETS. True Poets conquer Gloryâdo not woo It; do not beg their way to Fame; Nor at her skirts in private bend and sue, Nor sow the public broadcast with their name: They are the great High Priests of Heaven who Hold sacred as they feed their Altar-flame Within the Temple: No man hears their cry For recognition to the passers-by! They toil on like old Noah with his Boat; âELâ hath forespoken it, and it shall be Ready, although the need may seem remote: No sign that it will ever get to sea! They fight the Delugeâkeep the soul afloatâ And still work on, and leave the issue free With Him whose flood shall fall, or high-tide climb, To launch the Vessel in His own good time. Alone, in silence, secretly, they grow Invisibly, where no voice is raised to bless: Creating in the dark like Hills below The ocean, shaped by Nature's strong caress: Wave after wave sweeps over them; they know How many failures go to make success. Their victory's in their work, not in the word That waits to praise, as servant waits his Lord. At last they mount from out the Lethean flood Beyond the cloud that covers and conceals The present time, to join the Brotherhood Of minds that rise up lofty as the hills: Heaven crowns them in majestic solitude; The world, that saw not once, in wonder kneels! The less they wooed it all the more it heeds, And still they mount the more their Age recedes. THE HAUNTED HURST, A TALE OF ETERNITY. As One who, in a strange and far Country, In presence of his future Bride may be, That keeps the secret of her face concealed, Until, as Wife, the Maiden stands revealed: And who doth make blind guesses at the face; Its wealth of nature and its gifts of grace: Much marvelling if the form beneath the folds Be like the picture that at heart he holds! And who, as chance befall, may furtively Feel the hid features that he cannot seeâ Trying to gather, with a Lover's touch, The least of all he longs to know so much: Even thus, before the Next World's face I stand, And o'er its clouded features pass my hand; Groping to get, where mortal sight doth fail, Some likeness of the face behind the Veil! It is the voice of Vision in the night; I learned in darkness what I speak in light: Perchance such ne'er attains the perfect True, And yet may utter meaning for the few, As sandiest Desert wastes reflect afar Light from our Sun to some benighted Star! PART I. Night after night I wakened with a start That tore the curtain-cloud of Sleep apart, As though I had been fettered fast by Death, Who imaged Sleep to take away my breath. The silence looked so ominous, the gloom Just losing shape and feature in the room: Had I but wakened sooner, without doubt, I should have found some dreadful secret out! Nothing to grapple with; nothing to see: Yet something fearful there must somewhere be; Some shadow of the Unapparent stole Over me, with a shiver of the soul: Dim horrors loomed from out each hiding-nook; A strange life lurked in the familiar look Of innocent things, as though upon the eve Of issuing, terrible as its prey perceive The Mantis in the likeness of a leaf, Changed in a moment to a Murderous Thief. I peered out of the window,ânothing there But the vast heavens with all their loneness bareâ The phantom presence of Immensity That from behind its dumb mask whispered me. At times a noise, as though a dungeon door Had grated, with set teeth, against the floor: A ring of iron on the stones; a sound As if of granite into powder ground; A mattock and a spade at work! sad sighs As of a wave that sobs and faints and dies. And then a shudder of the house; a scrawl As though a knife scored letters in the wall. About the room a gush and gurgle went, As if the water-pipe got sudden vent; Drop after drop, I heard it plop, and ping, Into some vessel, with metallic ring. Yet, on these very nights there was no rain; And then, betwixt the ear's suspense and strain, A faint voice crying in the air or brain. The wind would rise and wail most humanly With a low scream of stifled agony Over the birth of life about to be. Through all the house its coldest wave hath rushed, Although a moment since the night was hushed. And ere the hurried gust had ceased to moan, The dreaming dog would answer with its groan. At times I seemed to waken at a call, And rose up listening for the next footfall Which never came, as though it could not keep The step with that my spirit caught in sleep; For I, in waking, must have crossed the line Bounding the range of spirit-life from mine. I felt the Presence on that other side Grope where some secret door might open wide. I knew the brain might strike the electric spark Which should make live this phantom of the Dark. Once as I woke I could have sworn I saw A white face from the window-pane withdraw! But, softly in its place the curtain slid, Even in the unlifting of the swift eyelid. Sometimes I woke with lashes wet and bright With a strange glory of delicious light, As though an Angel had shone my shut eyes through And filled my soul with heaven, as Dawn with dew: A fragrance from afar with me would stay, And at my work my heart sang all next day. I am no Coward; never did believe That spirits can their hell or heaven leave To walk by night in the old human ways. For forty years this was my creed o' days. Somehow the dark another tale doth tell: We are so fearful of the Unfathomable! The Infinite is full of whisperings; With mortal tug the wildered spirit clings To its known shore of firm reality, Yet feels drawn outwardâlike the ebbing sea That hugs its beach so closely and in vainâ In this vast ebb of Being to its main. And it is eerie in the night to lie Lonesome, all naked to the awful skyâ This secret spawning-time of hell on earth, When mist and midnight give the toadstools birth, And worlds of shy leaf-shadowed life steal forth,â What time the Powers of Darkness have their day; Our world asleep and Heaven so far away: When in the shroud-like stillness there may be Shapes moving round us that we do not see! Our little sphere of life is darkly rimmed In the wide universe of Being brimmed With life perhaps inimical to us! Nor could we live if all were luminous. But is it certain we have lost the sight They had of old in watches of the night, Who heard the voices, saw the shape that stood Before them in the Soul's similitude? They saw with eyes of spiritâHeaven keep The veil of flesh about me dark and deep! What does the Darkness mutter? Is it Death That makes the light burn bluer with his breath? Was that a creaking of the stair? a Rat Nibbling the wainscot? did a flittering Bat Flap at the window? Floors will crack for sure, But may not unseen feet be on the floor? Spirits stand rapping at Life's outer gate, And, if we dare not open, will they wait? Was that the Death-Watch ticking in the wall? One's hair with reptile-life begins to crawl. Is there some Whispering Gallery of the ear, In which the other world we overhear? The very Mirror is a doorway, through Whose dark another face may look at you! Who knows with what those ghostly gleams are rife In spectral semblance of our sunlit life? What Night hath shielded from pursuing Day In sanctuary darkness, hid away, As Paramour of hers in some foul play? What viewless horrors in the wind may lurk, That fill the mind with Shadows grim and murk? What demons may be audibly at work? Maybe the voices of a sunless world That in the eclipse of night is doomward hurled: What groping outcasts of ignoble soul Are working through the darkness, like the mole, Crouching in dreams to steal on sleeping Men: Red-handed spirits that flung life back again To Him who gave, and hide their murder-mark In any secret corner of the dark: Eaves-droppers leaning listening with a grin, To think how some small keyhole-creeping sin Will ope the door and let the Tempter in. What wappened wantons lurking 'twixt the lights, May lie in wait for wanderers o' nights: What phantom shapes forlorn may meet and march In long procession under Night's dark arch, Stretching their arms to us, worm-fretted, all Hueless and featureless and weirdly tall: What rootless strays of life are ever blown About like floating ghosts of thistle-down, That seek a foothold and are whirled awayâ Dead leaves a-dancingâvanishing sea-spray; Homeless, as drifted clouds are hurried past Their heaven for ever, by the driving blast. And now we come to think, may we not hold Ghost-hands in ours, that turn them icy cold? A ghostly presence whitens in the cheek, And makes the blood run water,âwan and weak The swooning life from out us faintly fleets, And turns to drops at the chill touch it meets. The walls of flesh are waxing all too thin To keep the world of spirits from crowding in. We wrap the clothes about us; but, still bare In soul, we feel a wave of chillier air, Like that which brings the dawn, but that's a breath Of sweet new life, this hath the feel of death! The spirit-spiracles all open wide, And life seems drowning in the flooding tide; We cannot cry, the Unseen world doth strive To seal the mouth and bury the soul alive. I must believe in Ghosts, lying awake With them o' nights, when flesh will creep and quake, And lustily one pulls the Bell of Prayer, From this thick snow of Spirits to clear the air. No marvel that the Birds salute the Dawn, For all the dangers of the dark withdrawn; Break into singing with their first free breath, That they have swum the dim, vast sea of death, And hymn the resurrection of the Light, In praise to Him who kept them through the night And cared for His least little feathered things, Encompassed with the safety of His Wings; While those that cannot warble, twittering tell Of darkness passed once more, and all is well. With what a thankful heart I often heard The blessed cry of Morning's earliest Bird! How eagerly watched the weird and waning Night Turn deathly pale and pass away in light. Yet, I believe that God is master still. He reigneth; He whose lightest breath can thrill The universe of worlds like drops of dew, And if the Spirit-world hath broken through It cannot be unknown, unseen by Him; It must be with His will, not their mere whim. And if our world of breath be set aflood, Swimming in supra-normal neighbourhood, There is a soul within will not be drowned, Even though a sea of spirits surges round: An inner infinite with power to reach The level of its outer ocean-beach! Therefore I trust Him; shut mine eyes and say âLead on, O Thou, who only know'st the way! Father in Heaven, take my hand in Thine; Be at my heart, and in my countenance shine. Then, all unfearing, shall I face the gate At which the powers of Darkness lie in wait.â PART II. Once on a time, the ancient story saith, Some foolish Mummers danced a masque of Death. They bore his emblems, trying, every one, To out-parody the bony Skeleton; And, as the merriment grew, there glided in Grim Death Himself, mocking with ghastly grin At their poor make-believe; as who should say, âThis is the real thing and no mere play.â âTalk of the Devil,â say we, âand he's here,â Sudden as thunder-claps, when skies are clear. 'Twas thus all fears and phantoms of the past, Shaped into something palpable at last. One night, as I lay musing on my bed, The veil was rent that shows the Dead not dead. Upon a Picture I had fixed mine eyes, Till slowly it began to magnetize. So the Ecstatics on their symbol stare, Until the Cross fades and the Christ is there! Thus, while I mused upon the picture's face, A veil of white mist wavered in its place; And to a lulling motion I sank deep, With spirit awake and senses fallen asleep, Down through an air that palpitatingly Breathed with a breath of life unknown to me; And when the motion ceased, against the gloom, There lived another Form within the room, As if the Dark had suddenly made a face I saw the haunting Presence of the Place Embodied, strange and horrible, as rise The Torturers that stare in dying eyes: Or, as the Serpentâere a leaf be stirredâ Looks through the dark on some bewildered bird: A face in which the life had burned away To cinders of the soul and ashes gray: The forehead furrowed with a sombre frown That seemed the image, in shadow, of Death's crown; His look a map of misery that told How all the under-world in blackness rolled. A human face in hideous eclipse; No lustre on the hair, nor life i' the lips; The faintest gleam of corpse-light, lurid, wan, Showed me the lying likeness of a Man! The old soiled lining of some mortal dress: A Spirit sorely stained with earthiness. But, almost ere I could have time to fear, I saw what seemed an Angel standing near, And on Her face a smile for my relief: A dream of glory in my night of grief, Shedding an influent mildness through the awe, Pleasant to feel, as was the smile I saw: Indeed, methought she breathed a fragrance faint, That overcame some rotting charnel-taint. She wore a purple vesture thin as mist, The Breath of Dawn, upon the plum dew-kissed. No flame-hued, flame-shaped, Golden-Holly tree Ere kindled at the sun so splendidly As that self-radiant head, with lifted hair A-wave in many a fiery scimitar. The purple shine of Violets wet with dew Was in her eyes that looked me through and through. We think of Shades as native to the night; We photograph the other world in white, That will not paint its tints upon our sight. But there are Colours of the Eternal Light, And these were of them; pulsing such live glows As never reddened blood or ripened rose: No Mist from the past life as some have deemed The Dead to be; no pallid shadow dreamed By Greeks of old, but Life itself this seemed. And such a light was in the Angel's face, It made a glory round about the place To see by: as you mark in the gold ray The Motes that dance invisibly in the gray. But, deep in shadow of his inner night, The Dark Shape stood and sinned against the Light. As men have felt, when earth rocked underfoot, Their trust in it was wrenched up by the root; The firm foundations of all things had given, And any instant they might be in heaven: As one midway across a wide, white road, In winter, when all night the skies have snowed, Learns 'tis not earth but frozen stream beneath, And he is leaning on the arms of Death: So did I feel to find our earthy bound Of Substance was no longer safe or sound; That spirit-springs make quicksand of firm ground; That spirit-hands withdraw our curtains round; That spirit between particles can pass Surely and visibly, as light through glass; With power to come and go, stand upright, loom Dense to the eye, outlined against the gloom. The Dark Shape on me turned its eyes of guile, Sullen yet fierce. I read the wicked smile That sneeredââBehold the cause of all your fear! You need not shudder though while She is near.â And then he spoke, or seemed to speak, in words, Although I saw his thoughts like murderous swords, Or toothÃ¨d wheels, go whirling round within The fearsome face so shadowy and thin, And did not always need the speech to know What dreadful thing it was he had to show. âLo! I am one of those doomed souls who dwell In Heaven's vast Shadow which the Good call Hell. Lo! I am he, most miserable, who did His deed of darkness, fancying all was hid; The Awful eyes being on me all the while, And demons pointing at me with their smile; Who carry such a hell within my breast, That all about me throbs with my unrest, As though the heavens were shaken, or the earth Were overtaken in the throes of birth: Doors tremble open, walls disintegrate, And world to world flings wide its secret gate. With such a pulse of power my pangs awake At midnight, that from sleep they sometimes shake You! Matter, with Mind's thrillings, doth so quake, That atoms from their fellow atoms start, As though each felt the heave of some live heart.â Then seeing the questioning wonder in my look, He answered, as my turn of thought he took, âYes, it is true, all true, the thing you dreamed; Most real is the life that only seemed. Soul's no mere shadow that gross substance throws; Our passions are not pageantary shows, Exhaled from Matter, like the cloud from cape, They are the life's own lasting final shape. This scheme of things with all the sights you see, Are only pictures of the things that be. What you call Matter is but as the sheath, Shaped, even as bubbles are, by spirit-breath. The mountains are but firmer clouds of earth, Still changing to the breath that gave them birth. Spirit aye shapeth Matter into view, As Music wears the forms it passes through. Spirit is lord of substance, Matter's sole First cause, formative power and final goal.â âAnd who is this,â I asked, âthat in Her face Doth image humanly celestial grace; That calms my soul as when the Moon looks forth, Whose smile in heaven makes stillness on the earth?â âOne of those Ministers who are sent below To walk the earth, patrolling to and fro, As sentinels on guard, night after night, That in the darkness make a watch-fire light, Lest sleeping souls be helplessly surprised By the wild beasts of worlds not realized.â I looked, the shining face serenely smiled Away all terror like a thing beguiled. âOne of the dreadful Angels of the Lord, Who are His fiery-flaming two-edged sword, Which at each door and window waves and burns Until the Angel of the Dawn returns. They are with you, watching through the murkest hour, And seen, or unseen, hold us in their power, That when the devil rages in us, lo! We strike and strike, and yet there falls no blow. They maze and daze us standing there behind, And, as in dreams, we struggle bound and blind. The sharpest tortures that I have to bear Are when I feel Her presence hovering near. A ray from heaven turns to a sword in hell; The flash is maddening, we so darkly dwell! The heat of heaven is like the blazing ring Of fire that makes the Scorpion try to sting Itself to death; an air of Heaven's breath Is poison; hell is spiritual death: And this awakes us, with its stir and strife, Like tinglings of the drowned recalled to life.â I glanced again: I saw the look arise As of a drawn Sword in the Angel's eyes! âWe have met here for years. She comes to see Me digging nightly; grope for my lost key; Her presence kindles round me such a light, All heaven can see me prowling through the night; All hell make merry at the gruesome sight. âI never told my secret in your world, I kept it at the heart too closely curled; There, at my life-springs, did I nestle and nurse The hidden snake, my bosom's clinging curse; My worm of torment biting bitterly, And fed it fat for all eternity. And no eye saw it writhe in my white face, Or heard it hiss in its dark hiding-place, When any voice of secret murders told, And in its might it wantoned and grew bold. It gnawed my heart as with hell-fire for years. Drink would not drown it, nor a sea of tears Quench it, nor all the waters of the land Whiten my soul, or wash my red right hand! Whate'er I did, my heart with hell-fire burned; Mine eyes with redness swam where'er I turned. I fled and fled, and could not leave behind The still, unwinking Bloodhounds of the mind. I dared not slumber soundly, lest asleep The unsleeping secret from my lips should leap In dreams, and I on waking might have found Myself had turned Informer, and was bound In handcuffs, with the accusing faces round. âAnd so, at last, I pricked the bubble of breath, I plunged to hide me from Myself in death: I found the hell-hole in the wild whirlpool; Plucked the cold hand down on my brain to cool: I grovelled out my own deep grave; I fell Right through it, into open arms of hell. âI fancied, when I took the headlong leap, That death would be an everlasting sleep; And the white Winding-sheet and green sod might Shut out the world, and I have done with sight. Cold water from my hand had sluiced the warm And crimson carnage; safe the little form Lay underground: the tiny trembling waif Of life hid from the light; my secret safe. In vain. You cannot hide a deed like this, With all the heavens one cloud of witnesses: Useless to blot the blood out with the dust, When it hath eaten with its ruddy rust Into your spirit's hand, where, visibly The murder-stain leers through eternity! Look there!â I looked, and saw what seemed a hand, Or gore-soaked shadow of one that, like a brand When breathed on, kindled fiercely as he sighed; And plucked it from his bosom, where he tried To hide its guilty red. âThat gripped the knife That slew my child. This is its ruddy life, Red-hot; on fire of hell! In burning rings, The blood my fingers clutched, for ever clings, And clamps them with relentless ache and smart So closely that they will not pull apart. Once only, while I wept and almost prayed, They yielded just a little: then was played A spectral trick upon me; all between, They shone, thin-webbed with gore, and clearly seen As through a window, through the web there smiled Up in my face the face of my dead child. Better to bear this fiery grip of pain, Than they should open on that sight again. âThe whirling world had flung my life from it, And I felt falling through the Infinite, For weeks and months, and years on years of nights Innumerable, from stupendous heights; For, as a minute's slumber may be all As one with that of a million years, my fall So quickened being, that a minute's fears Made instantaneous a million years. No God to call upon, no Power to stay, No hand to clutch at on my endless way! When just as I was plunging in a cloud That lightened with the laugh of Hell, and showed It made of devilish faces, which grew glad And kindled at my coming, and all had A gap-toothed wicked grin, as though each one Saw in my face the kindred of its own,â All the dark host rejoicing as I came; All making sure as Marksman of his aim, When lo! a Hawk swoops from its height unheard, And from before his gun bears off his Bird!â So, while the gulf I gazed on grew and gaped, The black cloud curled about me demon-shaped, And all their claws for cruel welcome spread, I was caught up; borne swiftening overhead, By one on wings of light, with lightning shod, And then I knew that I was going to God,â That life but sets in life still more profound, As sunset into sunrise the world round; That all who enter by the gate of breath, Must pass before the Awful eyes in death, And stand all naked to the searching mien. I could not shrivel nor slink away unseen! âTo me the vast and horrible Unknown Was one dread face, and all the face one frown! Pain, sternness, pity eternal in a look That read my life, wide-open as a book. Not that the leaves turned over one by one, Revealing, page by page, all I had done,â The Sense is as a scroll where manifold Indelible things are day by day uprolled And registered for Memory to recall; Maps of the mental world hung on the wall: But Life is more than Letter or than Law, And deftly as the brain may take or draw Its daily tallies, never can it keep In fixÃ¨d figure all the fathomless Deep Of Consciousness conceals, whose restless sea Ripples on changing sands unceasingly. Spirit is one. It is the crystal book, Clear through and through; read at a single look. To all the thoughts that ever passed through us In life, in death we grow diaphanous. We do not think what we have been, we are Past, present, future, without near or far. A glimpse of this is lightened, when the blind Is raised, in drowning, from the seeing Mind! So the electric flash, thrown on the wheel Revolving swift in darkness, will reveal Each whirling spoke distinctly standing still. In spirit-world at once you find the whole Of life contemporary with the soul. âThere is strange writing of the passing guest Featured upon the form it leaves at rest, Which men in some dim wise may read, but here Is the live Chronicler itself! the clear Truth nakedâbrain and body were but dressâ Quickened by the Eternal consciousness. âSo, when before that face, I felt the frown, There was no need of Hell to drag me down, I could have welcomed wafts of burning flame To clothe my nakedness of deadly shame. I lifted to my brow one shading hand, But snatched it burning from the Murderer's brand. The other to mine eyes I pressed; 'twas red And wet and dripping with the blood I shed. I tried to cover up my aching sight, And found myself all eye to pitiless light. âIn olden times, it was the wont, they say, To bring the Murderer where his victim lay, And at his touch, as to his slaying knife, The wound would flush: Death speak with lips of Life. âSo, from the frown, a little tiny Child Looked out on me and innocently smiled! âI shrieked my guiltiness at sight of it, And downward plunged, for hiding in the Pit. ââCurse God and die,â the Tempter said of old. I curse, and back the curses crowd tenfold. Against the cold Heaven strikes my burning breath, To fall in dews of wrath with second death. And still I curse, and yet I cannot die; And still I watch for Death with pleading eye, To find that he will nevermore draw nigh. Would the Almighty One had spit on me, And wiped the blot from His eternity! PART III. âMy Temptress lives on still. She is a Wife And Mother; lives an unsuspected life. She hath grown fat and flourished on the ill, The poison, that should naturally kill. That cruel stain of Murder seemed to pass From off her face of life as breath from glass. I sometimes play the devil in her dream, And plague her with a glimpse, one lurid gleam Of all my torment; her thick veil I tear, And lay the unholy of unholies bare, Else were her heart untroubled, deaf and blind. Things out of sight with her are out of mind, And should she hear a voice from the Unknown She takes it for an echo of her own. âAh, Mistress, did you know we have to stand Together yet, as equals, hand in hand, Like Eve and Adam, shivering side by side, Where not a leaf our nakedness can hide; Our secret blazoned, as a flag unfurled High on the housetops of another world! âShe was a buxom beauty! In her way Imperious as the Thane's Wife in the Play. A woman who upon the outside smiled, Burnished like beetles, inwardly defiled; With hair that like a thunder-cloud, black-brightening, Caught the sunlight, and flashed it back in lightning. No Demon ever toyed with worthier folds, About a comelier throat, to strangle souls; A face that dazzled you with life's white-heat, Devouring, as it drew you off your feet, With eyes that set the Beast o' the blood astir, Leaping in heart and brain, alive for her; Melted the sword of soul within its sheath: The knee-joints loosened, smitten by her breath, Until you bowed, as the strong beast bowÃ«th, When taken captive by the dark of death: Lithe, amorous lips, cruel in curve and hue, Which, greedy as the grave, my kisses drew With hers, that to my mouth like live things clung Long after, and in memory fiercely stung: A dainty morsel of the Devil's meat To roll beneath my tongue, as poison sweet! Had not the Mother ate forbidden food, This was the Daughter among Women who would âBut what avails to cast on her the blame? I will not: will not name her by her name. The deed is done; the sin is sinned; the brand Is on my brow; the blood burns on my hand. âI must have been a beast myself from birth. We lived as Beasts in that old burrow of earth They called a House; the Cot where I was born; One of those dwellings Poets will adorn Outside with Honeysuckle and climbing Rose, But where, within, no flower of Heaven blows With sweetening breath, for want of air and light, And in the wild weeds crawl the things of night: Where any life-warmth quickens the dark slime Of hovelled sin to swarm in shame and crime. âMy Pastoral Home was one wherein are grown Boys for the Hulks; girls for the pitiless Town That flaunts beneath the gaslights on the highway, The full-blown flowers of many a filthy by-way! Where Virtue has no safeguard, Vice no veil; The Devil sowed his seed, never to failâ With such a soilâin growing harvest meet For him, as sure as corn is grown to eat. âI should have been the beast that Nature binds To beaten ways, and with her blinkers blinds, But, was a Beast with scope to work all ill; Treat Wife and dumb things cruellyâsinâkillâ And go to Hell by freedom of the will. And yet I knew notâsuch the curse of sin!â Until the fall came, what was ripe within; What demon I had nursed past suckling-time, To find that it could go alone in crime. âShe came to me, her great black eyes aglare Like stars of bale, yet with the hunted stare Of wild things; such as made me stare to see What danger followed her and threatened me. I knew that Nemesis was drawing near, And in the beating of my heart could hear The footsteps that will shake strong men with fear. âWhat is it?â I asked. What need for her to tell? 'Twas writ all over her. I knew too well. And still I stared beyond, as if that way The blackness rose that blotted out my day. For days, and weeks, and months her secret lay Safe-nestled, unsuspected by her friends, But one day all disguise in sinning ends, And every way-side hiding-place is past. She had to leave her home and flee at lastâ Mad with the misery of a Mother's pain, She ran to me, through fire, and hail, and rain, And mire below, and thunder overhead; Ran lightning-dazed, and drenched, till nearly dead. âWell I remember that Last Day. I see It lightning-lit. I feel it stamped in me, As with the black seal of Eternity. It was about mid-Spring, when suddenly The rear of beaten Winter turned in ire, And there was battle fierce of Frost and Fire. The Birds stopped singing; all the golden flame O' the Sun went out; the Cattle homeward came. With a forerunning shiver rushed the breeze, And, in the Woods, the hushed and listening trees, That had been standing deathly-dark and still, Wind-whitened sprang, with every leaf athrill. I watched the tortured clouds go hurrying by, Racked with the rending spirit of prophecy: Like Pythonesses in the pangs, they tossed And writhed in shadowy semblance of the Lost: They met, they darted death, they reared, they roared, And down the torrent of the tempest poured! Through heaven's windows the blue lightnings gleamed, And like a fractured pane the sky was seamed: Hailstones made winter on the whitened ground, And for two hours the thunder warrayed round. And then I heard the Thrush begin again, With his more liquid warble after rain. âTearing through all the fearful storm she came; Worse storm within, and in her eyes hell-flame Had broken loose to kindle, past control, In huge dare-devilry of reckless soul. As springs a Madman, dancing upon deck, Who hath doomed the Ship, and glories in the wreck; As at a Prison-window one may stand Who fired the house, and waves the lighted brand, Her spirit sprang at mine. Her looks were wild. She had come to me, she said, to bring the child, For no one had a greater right to it! This was God's truth, not merely meant for wit. She swore that she had come there and would stay Till it was born, and safely put away. And even while I cursed her pangs grew worse, And stopped me with an everlasting curse. âGood God! this is too bad,â I thought; and laughed A laugh as bitter as the cup I quaffed. I had been married just a month! my Wife Knew nothing of this dead love come to life. As Fate would have it, she had gone from home: I knew that any minute she might come. With desperate voice the woman made me writhe; Harsh as the whetstone on the Mower's scythe She rasped me all on edge; the hell-sparks flew, Till there seemed nothing that I dared not do. âKill it, you Coward! Why not kill us both?â She taunted me; and I felt little loth. Then something whispered, âWhy not kill them both?â I said I would, and clenched it with an oath.â Now, while he spake, there came a frightful change Upon him with transfiguration strange, And slowly he assumed his mortal dress With a last look of dying consciousness: The eyes turned stony in a sightless stare, And of all presence he grew unaware: Clouded and lost within his dreadful dream He went; a Man once more, each pore a stream Of inner agony; his body shook, And from his mazÃ¨d face did âMurderâ look. It was as when in dreams you see a dumb Mouth shaped to cry it, though no sound will come! While in his hand he grasped a gleaming knife, So keen, you saw it thirst for a drink of life: And, as he passed into his haunted gloom, His dreadful purpose drew him from the room. So terrible the scene, I should have cried For help in the death-eddies,âmust have died But for the strong calm Spirit at my side, Who took me by the hand and turned on mine Her cordial face with comfortable shine. And then the darkness gave a sudden sigh, And a wind rose that went lamenting by. âListen,â She said. I leaned, all ear, to hark; I felt the quake of footsteps through the dark, Heavily hurrying down a distant stair, And caught a piteous wail faint on the air. The dog howled his lone cry, as he would fain Give warning, knowing it was all in vain. Then came the liquid gurgle and the ring Metallic, with the heavy plop and ping, Heavier than largest water-drops that fall From melting icicles on house-eaves tall. I knew them now; this resurrection night Sounds were translated into things of sight. These were the innocent drops a father shed; They had the weight of blood, fell heavy as lead. And now again I felt the grinding sound O' the grating door; the digging underground; The shudders of the house; the sighs and moans; The ring of iron dropped upon the stones; The cloudy presence prowling near; the quake Of walls that vibrate with the parting shake; Then the relief. As they who stoop with dread, While the Simoon goes withering overhead Like iron red-hot, look up and breathe at last, So felt I when that thing of Night had passed. 'Tis but a dream, methought, and I shall wake Ere long and from its dread embraces break. And if I could but only wake, I knew By light of day these things could not be true! How many a dream before had wraith-like gone To nothing at the sceptic smile of Dawn. And still I could not wake, nor wake my Wife; And still the dream went on, and like as life There stood the Angel in it; overshone The well-known room. And then Her voice went on. âThe nether world hath opened at your feet, And you have seen ascending from the Pit The torment-smoke, where furnace-fires of Crime Have cracked the crust of this your world of Time. âIt was an awful hour of storm and rain And starless gloom in which the Child was slain. Wild, windily the Night went roaring by, As if loud seas broke in the woodlands nigh, Or all the blasts of Heaven at once were hurled To stop the onward rolling of the world. The firmament was all one flash, and fled:â The lightning laughed, as Hell were overhead. âHe had dug his grave amid this war of storm; He bore the murdered Babe upon his arm For burial, where no eye should ever mark! Just then Heaven opened at him with the bark Of all the Hell-hounds loosed. And in the dark Out went the light, and down he dropped the key, That was to lead to safety secretly. He was alone with Death, and paces three Beyond the door an open grave gaped, free For all the daylight world to come and see; And he was fastened. Like the luckless wight Who wagered he would enter a Vault at night In some old Graveyard, and, in proof he did, Would leave his dagger stuck in a Coffin-lid.â He ventured: bravely dashed the weapon down, And turned to triumph, when, by the student-gown He was held fast, as if the living Tomb Had closed upon him; clutched him in the gloom. He had pinned his long robe to the coffin! Fright Came on him like a snow-fall! Weirdly-white His hair turned, and the youth was a forlorn, Old, gray-faced, gibbering Idiot next morn. âThe murderer did not madden thus, but he Was stamped as if for all Eternity. He stooped with his dead child, he groped and found The key, and got the Corse safe underground, And out of sight had hid his murder-hole, Ere Dawn looked ghostly on his guilty soul, And on his hands no man could see the stain. His madness went beyond the burning brain; His was the frenzy of a soul insane. âThe hour came when he lost that key again. As the death-rattles thundered in his throat, And earth was rushing past his soul afloat, And pain had fiercely throbbed itself to rest, And time stopped ticking in the brain and breast, It gleamed and vanished from his fading sight, And snapped his eye-strings straining through the night. Thenceforth it was his hottest hell to be Living the moment when he lost his key: Hell that is permanent insanity! âThere was a man who died ages ago, And 'tis his madness still to wile his woe At work for ever, perfecting the plan That should have, must have shown his fellow-man How innocent he was of that old crime He died for justlyâhad he thought in time. âEven so this lost soul whirls and eddies round The grave-place where the lost key must be found, If the mad motion would a moment cease, And he could only get a moment's peace; He often sees it, but he cannot touch It; like a live thing it eludes his clutchâ Gone like that glitter from the eyes of Death In the black river at night that slides beneath The Bridges, tempting souls of Suicides To find the promised rest it always hides. âFor seven years it was his curse to come At midnight and fulfil his dreadful doom, Looking for that lost key, lest it revealed The secret he so carefully concealed; Feeling at times he could endure his hell If in one world of torment he might dwell. And still from world to world he had to go Wandering with incommunicable woe; Well knowing that, for every moment lost, His soul would be in treble anguish tossed, While every storm of wind and rain would beat Down on him, kindle hell to tenfold heat, And make him hurry to your upper air, Lest it should blow and wash the bones all bare. For often will a wind of God arise At midnight, and the voice of Murder cries From it, and bones of murdered babes are found; Earth will no longer be their burial ground. And so on stormy nights his pangs are worst; More live the portent in the blackness hearsed: More dread the gnashings of that soul accursed. âFor seven years he came, unseen, unheard. 'Twas but the other day the bones were stirred. As men were delving heedless underground, They broke in on them, scattered them around: Not guessing they were human. Lower in hell His spirit sank, like waters in a well Before there springs the Earthquake. Tremblings sore Shook him with vengeance never felt before. He came; he found the murder had leaped out; The grave was burst; the bones were strewn about For all the world to find! It mattered not To him that no one knew them; they might rot To undistinguishable dust in peace; That Death had signed his order of release From this world's law; Death had no shadows dim Enough to hide the blacker truth from him. He was the Murderer still, who had to hide The proofs of murder on the human side! The Child was his; these were its tender bones, Blown with the dust and dashed against the stones. And all his care, his self-enfolded pain And midnight watchings lone, were all in vain. âThe worms that in the dead flesh riot and roll Are poor faint types of those that gnawed his soul! For ever beaten now; though he should find And grasp the key he lost when he went blind In death: In vain he mounts upon a wind Of torment; tries to fan the dry dust over them With endless toil; no sooner does he cover them Than there's an ominous muttering in the air, And in an instant all the bones lie bare; While lurking devils grin through masks at him, In likeness of his Child's head, gorily grim! âIt comes upon him, almost with a gleam Of comfort, when he's rapt into the Dream You saw him change in, and he passes through His night of murder; lives it all anew, So vividly each sound is heard by you; Each particle of Matter set afloat Upon a Mind-wave, tossing like a boat The Spirit rides. For, as, upon his brain, The sounds one midnight smote in a ruddy rain, Till sense had dyed the spirit with their stain, And Memory was branded deep as Cain, So now his spirit echoes back again The fixed ideas of a soul insane, Till Matter taking impress of his pain, Reverberates the sounds within your brain.â PART IV. I mused and mused in great astonishment, While on, and on, the growing wonder went Within, without, on wings that widelier spread. âHow many things,â oft to myself I had said, âI have to ask, if one came from the dead.â And now I had my wish. My thought could rise No fleeter than the answer filled her eyes And flashed electric utterance with the whole Illumined figure of a living soul! âMore Laws than Gravitation keep us down To the old place from whence the soul had flown. Not every one in death can get adrift Freely for life. Some have no wings to lift Their weary weight: the body of their sin Which they so evilly have laboured in: Others will touch as 'twere the window-sill To flutter back upon the ground-floor still. Others yet grovel like the beast belogged In the old ways, to which they are self-clogged. Just as the Spirits of an earlier race Of Man in dwarfhood, kept their dwelling-place On earth, and revelling in the moon's pale rays, Were seen as Wee Folk in old wondering days. âA-many wander this side of the grave To get the last glimpse they can ever have Of those they loved, who will be lost in light, While they go darkling and are lost in night. They see them sometimes in the world of breath; They part for ever at the second death. Others would blot from out the book of Time The published proofs of their long-secret crime That glare so guiltily to spirit-sight. Teachers who called Good evil; darkness light; Who see more clearly in the unclouding day, Strive to recall the souls they led astray, And find the world, that once hung on their breath, Goes by them now; heedless, and deaf as Death. Some, who have done a wrong that, unperceived, Ran to a sea of sin, are sorely grieved, And ready to spend the next life shut from bliss, Might they but right the wrong they did in this: So clear, so awful, when the past is seen, Grows the dark mystery of might-have-been. âThis happened under the broad shining day, Right in the rush of life that makes its way Through London streets. Slowly, 'mid that swift throng, A thoughtful man went mooningly along; More lonely in that wilderness of men. And at a corner where the Devil's den Is palace-fronted nowâall gilt and glassâ Illuminating nightly all who pass By the broad way to Hell with gin and gas, And souls are sloughed, like city sewage, down Dead-Sea-ward, through the sink-holes of the town, He heard a pitiful voice that took strange hold Of him; ran through his blood in lightnings cold; Mournful, remote, and hollow, as if the tomb Had buried a live spirit in its gloom, Monotonously praying on below A vast unutterable weight of woe; A voice that its own speaker would not know! As if unbreathing life were doomed to bear Shut down on it the load of all the air. He stopped. A woman clothed in rags he saw With fixed beseeching eyes begin to draw Him to her; left no power to say them nay. With one stretched arm she begged; on the other lay, Soft in a snow of gold, a Cherub Child! So have you seen a Glowworm on the wild Wide moorland; all the dusk a moment smiled. âFor the babe's sake he thrust a coin of gold Into her hand! but, it fell through, and rolled Ringing along the stones: he followed, found It, brought it back and looked around: There was no woman waiting with her hand Outstretched, no Child, where he had seen them stand. In vain he searched each by-way round about; Through life even, never made the mystery out. âThe truth is, he was one of those who see At times side-glimpses of eternity. The Beggar was a Spirit, doomed to plead With hurrying way-farers, who took no heed, But passed her by, indifferent as the dead, Till one should hear her voice and turn the head; Doomed to stand there and beg for bread, in tears, To feed her child that had been dead for years! This was the very spot where she had spent Its life for drink, and this the punishment; She felt she had let it slip into the grave, And now would give eternal life to save: Heartless and deaf and blind the world went by, Until this Dreamer came, with seeing eye; The good Samaritan of souls had given And wrought the change that was to her as Heaven. âIt is not Crime alone brings Spirits back To pull beside you in the wonted track. Shadows of mortal care will cloud the brow That should have shone as clear as sunlit snow: And those who hindered here must help you now. Not always can the soul forgive in heaven Itself for deeds that have been long forgiven. âA wedded couple, bedded, snug as birds In nested peace, one night must needs have words Of strife before they slept. A foolish thing Had on a sudden set them bickering; Some wild-fire wisp had dropped a subtle spark That kindled at a breath blown through the dark, And all their passion burst in tongues of flame: Their anger blinding both to personal blame. She had been pillowed on his beating heart, And in an instant they had sprung apart! The arm that wound about her he withdrew, And Night, with dark divorce, came 'twixt the two. âA little thing had plucked them palm from palm; A little thing had broke their happy calm; A little thing fall'n in the pleasant path Of their life-stream, that turned to bubbling wrath! And little might have made them yield and cling Repentant; yea, a very little thing. A touch would have sufficed to make the stream Flow calm once more; dream out its happy dream. A kiss have fused them into one again, And saved them many a year of piteous pain. 'Twas such a little thing they had to do; Both yearned to make it up, and this each knew. If one could but have said âGood-night,â scared Love Would have come down to brood like Holy Dove. And, being done, all would have been so well. Not being done, it left the rift for Hell To break through, and another triumph win,â Ever the worst of Traitors are within: But neither spoke, though long upon the wing Love waited lingeringly listening! âWaking, he heard her in her slumbers weep, And then he slept, and in the guise of Sleep Death came for him, nor gave him time to say âGood-night,â âGood-bye,â and at his side she lay A Widow! And upon that dark no day Hath broke for her. For him, no hell nor heaven Will open; praying still to be forgiven, Night after night at her bedside he stands, Wringing his soul as one may wring the hands; By natural law of grievÃ¨d love; not sent By Vengeance for unnatural punishment. âThe unslain shadows of the Martyrs slain, Rise on their fields of old heart-ache and pain, To fight their battle over and over again. Half-buried hands, still thrust up through the sod, From fields of carnage, prayerfully to God, Will grasp the weapons of immortal war. Freed spirits make their conquering battle-car Of human hearts: they do but hold their breath To smite unheard in their dark cloud of death. They work for Freedom still, though out of sight; They are torch-bearers in your mortal night. The Tyrants may destroy the body; drench The life out with the blood, but cannot quench It! They may string the corses high in air, But cannot keep the soul suspended there. âWide as the wings of Sleep by night are spread, Are Freedom's Exiles scattered, and her dead Have lain them wearily down beneath God's dome. But every banished spirit hurries home, Soon as the free, long-fettered life up-springs Awave one day on mighty warrior-wings. Each soul, let out, fights with the strength of seven, Under God's shield, and on the side of Heaven. âThe other world is not cut off from this: Forgetfulness is not the gate of bliss. At times the buried dead within you rise To look out on their old world through your eyes; They touch you with the waving of their wing, Lightly as airs of heaven the Ãolian string. At times as Comforters above you stoop, To lift the burden from you when ye droop! As parents on their little ones may peep Ere going to rest, they bend to bless your sleep. They show you Pictures which are faintly wrought In shadows that take life in waking thought. With fruit from our Lord's Garden dear ones come To bring you a foretaste: try to lure you home. âWith clap o' the shoulder, friends behind you steal The old glad way which ye no longer feel: They watch you as ye watch the darkened mind Of some arrested spirit; try to unwind A way to it; with drops of pity melt The clod about it; have your fondness felt: Even as ye turn your thoughts to them above, Do they return to you; look back for love. âThey left you standing still at gaze upon The cloud they entered, where the light last shone. And while the wet eyes yearn and watch the track, As if by that same way they might come back, And through the dark ye stretch the ungrasped hand, There, at some window of the soul, they stand All whitely clothed with immortality, Closer to you than flesh and blood can be. The cloud is lifted from the vapoury bourne; Although you know them not, the dead return; To dry the Mourner's tear and hush the wail, There's nought between you but a Viewless veil! âOld loves are with you in your dreams; but fear Lest they should make their presence felt too near; The face of Love in Heaven they dare not show, Lest with its glory they might set aglow Your earthly love, which leaps to embrace a bliss That lives and dies in a consuming kiss. So warm LaodamÃ¯a wooed her dead Dear Husband's Shade, as if they were new-wed! âAnd certain spirits are perplexed to find How like their life to that they left behind In natural nearness to their darlings here, Who lose them just because they are so near In life that grows impenetrably clear! âMany who tossed together on the sea, And parted in the storm; lost utterly; Find they were only wrecked to meet again, Safe on the same shore, after all the pain. God hath so many paths by which we come To Him; through many doors He draws us Home. 'Tis but His wilderness of secret ways That to our vision seems a trackless maze. âOthers are horribly startled at the change Revealed in death, all is so wondrous strange! So many weeds, your blind world flung aside, Are gathered up as flowers, thrice-glorified. So many Masters in the realms of breath Serve at the feet of those who are crowned in death. So many who ruled the world are set to rule Themselves for ages in a painful school. The Invisible dawns! The sleepers wake to find Less death in dying than in living blind: And now the eyes their earthly scales let fall, They see that they have never lived at all. âI knew a follower of the strictest faith, Whose dead religion rested on a death, And frequent praying in the market-place, With proclamation of his private grace; Who sat among the loftiest Self-Elect, But had not learned through life to walk erectâ Strait-waistcoated in stony pietiesâ And when Death cameâthe Iconoclast who freesâ He could not stand without their rigid stay: The Maker's image had but stamped the clay. As one may don the fashion of a day, On earth he wore the mask of Man awhile, But when the Searchers stripped him, with a smile, The wizened spirit shrank from man's disguise: It fled, and fell, and wriggled, reptile-wise. Some had been hailed immortals upon Earthâ Immortals prematurely brought to birth. âAnd are you happy in your Heaven,â they said, âO Great One?â But he sadly shook his head, And with both clutching hands upheld his crown That only kept onâtoppling, tumbling down. His earthly halo was a world too wide; His glory of greatness shrank so when he died, That blatant Fame evoked with her misfit Derisive laughter from the Infinite. âI have seen the foolish slaves of luxury, Who loll at ease and live deliciously; In Pleasure's poppy-garden drowse and press With amorous arms my Lady Idleness; Who, floating downward in voluptuous dream, Just lean to catch the sparkles from Life's stream That runs with Siren-sound and dizzying dance, And hides its wrecks with winking radiance,â Who, risen from life's feast, came reeling thence Immortals, drunken with the fumes of Sense; I've seen them in a pleasure-seeking group, At Death's low door with mock politeness stoop, And wantonly they went, nodding the head, As though to lightsome music they were led: Heedless the merry madcaps came before The awful gate, as 'twere a Playhouse door; It opened, and the darlings entered in As to the secret Paradise of Sin! But in a moment what a change there was. In front of them there rose a mocking glass In place of drop-sceneâthis was not a Playâ In which they stared, and could not turn away, But still stared on, in silence one and all, To see their finery fade, their feathers fall; In this grim moulting of the plumes of pride They had to lay all ornaments aside; And on the face of every Woman and Man, Like wet paint on a mask, the colours ran; The skin grew writhled, and within the head Their eyes looked like gray ghosts of hopes long dead. âThe naked image of their own Selves they see, Stripped in the Mirror of Eternity; Worm-eaten through and through with thoughts that prey On life itself, and eat the soul away. Wine-cups await them; though well-kept for years The wine, it had been made of human tears, And tasted bitter! Fruit was given to eat, The fruit of their own life; so smiling-sweet It looked! like apples when the shining round Is made of rose-leaf on a golden ground; The crimson and the golden melting through, Right to the core, in one delicious hue. But these were Apples of the Dead-Sea shore; Ashes without, and maggots at the core. Saluting their fine nostrils Odours rise; The scent of lifelong human sacrifice! The brother's blood, that climbs to them and cries. Then are they led where healing waters wait To wash the soilÃ¨d soul; repristinate The image of God so earthily concealed; But while they lave find, more and more revealed, Deeper disfigurement and deadlier stain, As wetted marble shows the darker grain. PART V. âThe dim world of the dead is all alive; All busy as the bees in summer hive; More living than of old; a life so deep, To you its swifter motion looks like sleep. Whether in bliss they breathe, in bale they burn, His own eternal living each must earn. We suck no honeycomb in drowsy peace, Because ennobling natural cares all cease; We live no life, as many dream, caressed By some vast lazy sea of endless restâ For there, as here, unbusy is unblest. âMan is the wrestling-place of Heaven and Hell, Where, foot to foot, Angel and Devil dwell, With both attractions drawing him. This gives The perfect poise in which his freedom lives. No one so near to heaven to lack for scope; No one so near to hell to lose all hope. Whichever way he wills, to left or right, Lets in a flood of supernatural might. He flames out hellward, and all hell is free, Rejoicing in the gust of liberty, To rush in on him, work its devilry! In strength of faith, or feebleness of fear, He bows and bends the highest heavens near. The brightness upon Prayer's uplifted face Reflects some spirit-presence in the place. âEach impure nature hath its parasites, That live and revel in unclean delights. Like moths around a flame they float and swarm; Like flies about a horse, they ride the warm And reeking air which is their atmosphere, Their breath of life, the ranker the more dear. They glory in the grossness of the blood, For, reptile-like, they lay their eggs in mud. In every darksome corner of the mind They hang their webs, the wingÃ¨d life to bind; Weaving the shadow of the Evil One To darken 'twixt the spirit and its sun. âIf those blind Unbelievers did but know Through what a perilous Unknown they go By light of day; what furtive eyes do mark Them fiercely from their ambush of the dark; What motes of spirit dance in every beam; What grim realities mix with their dream; What serpents try to pull down fallen souls, As earth-worms drag the dead leaves through their holes; What cunning sowers scatter seed by night That flames to fatal flower in broad daylight; And rub their hands at having danced it in Ere the sun rise to ripen it in sin! What foul birds drop their eggs in innocent nests, To win their heat from warmth of innocent breasts: What snaky thieves surmount each garden wall; On life's fresh leaves what caterpillars crawl; What cool green pleasaunces and brooding bowers Are set with soul-snares hid among the flowers; What Tempters in the Chamber of Sleep will break, And with insidious whisperings keep awake The Soul! How, toad-like, at the ear will lurk The squatted Satan, wickedly at work: What evil spirits hover in amorous hate Round him who nibbles at the devil's bait, Or him who dallies, fingering the sharp edge Of peril, or sits with feet beyond the ledge, By some dark water, with his face ash-wan, Until they urge him over: a doomed Man! What cruel demons try to break a way, Through weak brains, back to their lost world of day, Till from some little rift in nature yawns A black abysm of madness, and Hell dawns: What starvelings seek to drink Corruption's breath From rosy life, more rich than rot of death; What ghosts of drinkers old would quench their drouth At the wine-bibber's dreaming stertorous mouth; What Sirens seek to kindle at your fire Of passion some live spark of dead desireâ They would be ready even to doubt God's power To shield their little life from hour to hour, And many would be going, with idiot-grin, Out of their mind to let the marvel in. âBut do not think the Devil hath his will. Whate'er he doth he is God's servant still. And in the larger light of day divine The spark of his hell-fire shall cease to shine. God maketh use of him; what he intends For evil Heaven will turn to its own ends. With subtle wile he tries to circumvent The Lord, and works just what the Master meant. He hangs the dark cloud round this world of yours; God smileth, and a rain of good down-pours. He strove to found the Empire of the Slave, It crumbled in: he had but delved its grave. âHe stole upon a Nation, in disguise Of thieves that prowled by night; day-lurking spies; Plotters who privily set their eyes to mark Her weakness, and garrotted her i' the dark! The face of Freedom frightfully they scarred, That men might know her not, so sadly marred, And, seeing her in the dust, misjudge her stature; And, finding she grew calm, mistake her nature! They built about her; dreamed not she would stand Up, terribly tall once more; and, in her handâ Clenched, till the knuckles whiten with their gripâ And the blood blackens 'neath the nails that nipâ The sword set sharp as is her red-edged lip: And in her eyes the lightnings that should break In blinding, black, irreparable wreck:â Rending their roof to heaven, their walls to earth, (The sorer travail the more glorious birth!) An Earthquake crash! the edifice is crowned, And there's a heap of ruin on the ground!â Arise, to sweep them from her onward path, Stern as the Spectre of God's whitest wrath. Even while they clutched the gains of their foul play And parted them, I heard the Avengers sayâ âThey plant in dust a breath will blow away, Although they wet it well with blood to-day. ââAy, Traitor, mount your topmost pinnacle. The merry-making Heavens would mark you well, Where all the gazers of the world may see You throned upon the peak of infamy!â So crooned the implacable ministers of Fate, Standing in shadow where they watch and wait. ââWell done. Now place the crown upon your brow, With its brave glitter all eyes dazzle now: Lost in its splendour is that frightful stain Branded beneath; the murder-mark of Cain!â So crooned the implacable ministers of Fate, Standing in shadow where they watch and wait. ââWell done. Now fold the Imperial Purple round, And let a Pope's Anointed, robed and crowned, Thus glorify the blood so basely spilt; Thus image to all time the loftiest guilt.â So crooned the implacable ministers of Fate, Standing in shadow where they watch and wait. ââWell done, thou faithful servant. Hell shall rise From half her thrones to offer you their prize, And meet you coming; greet you with a kiss Of benison, for such a deed as this!â So crooned the implacable ministers of Fate, Standing in shadow where they watch and wait.â âWas Satan sent from heaven to ruin earth?â I asked, âor what the story of his birth?â âBoth heaven and hell are from the human race, And every soul projects its future place: Long shadows of ourselves are thrown before, To wait our coming on the eternal shore. These either clothe us with eclipse and night, Or, as we enter them, are lost in light. âWe look on Evil as the shadow dark Of the reflected bridge; the nether Arc, That makes some perfect circle of night and day, Through which our river of life runs on its way To that wide sea where, all Time-shadows past, It shall but mirror one clear heaven at last. âThere is no Devil such as Milton saw; No fallen Angel's eyes divined the flaw In God's work, whereby Man might be accursed. The Devil was a murderer from the first, Was said of old. But it was softly nursed Up from a babe in arms. A little seed Of sin was sown that grew with little heed. By door or window little sins will win A way that widens for the larger sin, As tiniest lichens, climbing up the wall, May lend a hand to help the Ivy crawl That is to tower a conqueror over all The house in ruin, crumbling to the fall. Once life is set in motion there upspring Infinite issues to the smallest thing. A finger's breadth in swerving as we start May land us in the end two worlds apart. âOur parents were not tempted by a Tree That hung out luscious fruitage, visibly Held in God's hand, on purpose to beguile Their simpleness with its suggesting smile. Take this as symbol of a world within; There was the serpent born, there bred the sin. The trees that midmost in the Garden stood, Took root in soul and blossomed in the blood. Nor were they left without the inward light, The starry presence shining through your night, That shows the wrong while it reveals the right: The magnet in the soul that points on through All tempests and still trembles to be true. âThe still small voice within cried âDo not this, Or it will lead from me, and ye will miss The innocent brightness of your morning bliss, And long in a wild wilderness will stray, Farther and farther from the primal way, Until ye lose me, darkling in a cloud Of your own making, winding like a shroud About the life I gave; nor feel me near When ye do call and think there's none to hear.â âAnd yet men dally with the thought of wrong Until they do it: looking down too long, Like him who, on a perilous mountain ledge, Gazes upon the gulf, dark o'er the edge, Till he grows dizzy, and, with brain a-swim, Forgetting to look upâdrops! Or, like him Who stood and watched that Titan, face to face, The vast Steam-Hammer, with its monster mace, Until the blows of its recurrent sound Snapped his last trembling hold of things around; Mazed him and drew him nigher, slip by slip, To thrust his hand into its crushing grip. âThey dallied with wrong-doing, and it grew Too strong to wrestle with, and overthrew. Eyes play with Pleasure! Looking overmuch Sets all the blood a-tingle for the touch! How the fruit smiles, delicious to the eyes; How quietly the Snake behind it lies,â The Beast that in the man erect and crowned Tends ever to go grovelling on the ground,â With all his weight bending the branch down near; The reptile music, sliding through the ear, Winds round the soul, makes it a-tiptoe stand With love-sick longing till it lifts the hand To pluck, and feel, and smell, and taste just one Ripe Apple, whose gold glistens so i' the sun! But one step over the forbidden marge; The sin so little, the delight so large! âThus is the Devil born: born every day, Harmless at first as toothless whelps at play; Is born in thoughts which are the quick live seeds That will be striving to take shape in deeds; So would be born could any race begin Afresh; so form the protoplasm of Sin, The pustule raised at just a prick of pin; The nest-egg which the Devil is hatched in. For Man, the outcome of Creation's past, Is flower of all earth's life from first to last: No lower life hath ever passed away But left its larvÃ¦ in the human clay. No reptile of the slime, no beast of prey, But human passions personate to-day. And these break loose to rend in deadly strife, And will break loose, till, in the higher life, The soul arisen to her immortal stature Leads, Una-like, these grim necessities of Nature. âTo picture what I mean: see here, a Wife, With bosom just a-brood o'er life-in-life, Who in a fury-fit snatched up a knife And hurled it at her husband. 'Twas a miss, Though near enough to hear Death's arrow hiss! She had not dyed her hand in human blood, But she had dipped her Unborn in a flood Of wrath that surged and smoked and flashed hell-flame; Given her babe baptism in the Devil's name: Stained the pure thing of heaven a lurid hue With fume o' the pit, the white star reddened through. And from that Mother-stricken life there grew A Murderer whose own hand that Mother slew. âThe ghosts of our own crimes long-buried will Live after us and haunt our children still. Our vices, hid for generations past, Break out and blab their secret tale at last. PART VI. âBut Earth is not the Devil's merry-go-round. The Angels of the Lord are ever found Encamped about the soul that looks to Him: These are an inner lamp when all is dim Without, they light poor souls through horrors grim. Even as a myriad sunbeams hour by hour Melt to make rich one little summer flower; Or as a myriad souls of flowers fleet Away to make a single summer sweetâ So many spirits make one smile of God That feeds your life transfiguring from its clod. There is no lack of Angel-carriers When mortals post to heaven their fervent prayers! And these are happy in their work, for still They find their heaven in doing the Father's will. The BlessÃ¨d do not leave some happy seat When they draw near ye upon silent feet. They have no need to thread their starry way Through worlds of night, or wilderness of day. Spirit to Spirit hath not far to run, Because in God all souls are verily one Throughout all worlds: there are no walls of Space Where all eternity is dwelling-place. âDistance is nothing in the world of Thought; So in the world of Spirit space is nought. You hear of dying men whose souls have been Present with distant friends; most surely seen Before the breathing ceased; for they were there In Thought so fixed, intense, that, on the air, Their lineaments the utter yearning wrought, In spiritual apparition of their thought, Till they grew visible. This Murderer dwells In Spirit where his Thought isâhottest Hell's For him where his infernal deed was done! The blood effaced so safely from the sun Hath stained right through beyond this world of time, Red to the other side, with his old crime. He does not merely come and go; he is All presence to the proofs and witnesses. âSpirits may touch you, being, as you would say, A hundred thousand million miles away. Those wires that wed the Old World with the New, And do your bidding hidden out of view, Are not the only links Mind lightens through! The Angels, singing in their heaven above, Feel when ye strike the unison of love. The prayers of heaven fall in a blessÃ¨d rain On souls that parch in purgatorial pain. Desires uplift from earth with a sense of wings, Poor souls that drift as helpless outcast things. âA luminiferous motion of the soul Pervades the universe, and makes the whole Vast realm of Being one;âall breathing breath Of the same life that is fulfilled in death, And human spirits, from their earthy bound, Can thrill the Immortals, in their crystal round, Like flames that leap to a point at some sweet sound, As though they rose on tiptoe listening; And set the farthest heavens vibrating, As air will dance close to a live harpstring. âGod, the Creator, doth not sit aloof, As in a picture painted on the roof, Occasionally looking down from thence. He is all presence and all providence; Sentient in whatsoever life may draw Breath from Him, and, beyond, He lives in law. He doth not sit at one end of the chain Of Being, thrilling it now and again; He who is Being and doth bound and bind Its particles in the Eternal Mind. Outside His providence we cannot stand. His presence makes the smallest room expand Wider than wings of Day and Night e'er fanned. I who am here, His Messenger, to-night, But bring that presence to a point in light. We are the agencies, the living laws, Whereby Creation is eternal Cause. âThis human life is no mere looking-glass, In which God sees His shadows as you pass. He did not start the pendulum of Time, To go by Law, with one great swing sublime; Resting Himself in lonely joy apart: But to each pulse of life is beating heart. And, as a parent sensitive, is stirred By falling sparrow, or heart-wingÃ¨d word. âAs the Babe's life within the Mother's, dim And deaf, you dwell in God, a-dream of Him Ye stir and put forth feelers which are clasped By airy hands, and higher life is grasped As yet but darkly. Life is in the root And looking heavenward, from the ladder-foot. Wingless as worms, with earthiness fast bound, Up which ye mount but slowly, round on round. Long climbing brings ye to the Father's knee; Ye open gladsome eyes at last to see That face of Love ye felt so inwardly. âIn this vast universe of worlds no waif Of spirit looks to Him but floateth safe. No prayer so lowly but is heard on high; And if a soul should sigh, and lift an eye, That soul is kept from sinking with a sigh. âAll life, down to the worm beneath the sod, Hath spiritual relationships to Godâ The Life of Life, the love of all, in all; Lord of the large and infinitely small. âBirds find their home across the pathless sea By no hereditary memory. From land to land they move, their way illumed By the inflowing Love that bore them, plumed For flight, through which the Mother Bird is taught To know which youngling had the last worm brought; The Insect led to garner food in nook For young, on which it never lives to look. âThe veriest atoms, even as worlds above, Are bridal chambers of creative Love, Quick with the motion that suspends the whole Of Matter spiral-spinning toward Soul. A spirit of life rides every tiny grain Of flower-seed flying through the air, for rain And wind to feed until its heavenly Sower Drops it to earth and it takes form,âa flower! And nothing is, but groping turns to Him, Like babe to bosom, though the sight be dim: Nothing but what reflects in some faint wise The image that is God in Angel eyesâ The Infinite One, whose likeness we but see Glassed in the Infinite of Variety: Just as the waters fix a fluttering beam, Caught in this chamber, and, with golden gleam, Throw on the ceiling, limned in little, one Pale image of the glory of the Sun! âNo seed of life blown down a dark abysm Of earth or sea but feels the magnetism That draws us Godward! Flowers sunk in mines, Or plants in ocean, where no sunbeam shines, Will blindly climb up toward their Deity, Far off in Heaven, whom they can never see. âThere is a Spirit of Life within the Tree That's fed and clothed from Heaven continually, And does not draw all nourishment from earth. It puts a myriad tender feelers forth, That breathe in heaven and turn the breath to sap: In every leaf it spreads a tiny lap To take its manna from the hand of God, And gather force for fingers 'neath the sod To clutch the earth with; moulds, from sun and rain, Its leaves; with spirit-life feeds every vein, And through each vein makes wood for bough and bark: Girth for the bole, and rootage down the dark. âSo Man is fed by God and lives in Him: Not merely nourished by his rootage dim In a far Past; a dead world underground, But spirit to spirit reaches life all round. âCreative heat is current in the soul From ages past, like sunshine in the coal, Some fire of heaven in fossil stored away, But spirit-life yet kindles at the ray Warm from our Sun that shines for us to-day! âNot in one primal Man before the Fall Did God set life a-breathing once for all, He is the breath of life from first to last; He liveth in the Present as the Past. But ye, like rowers, turn your eyes behind; Ye look Without, and vainly feel to find, Raised in relief, like letters for the blind, The substance of that Glory in the mind. âHints of the higher life, the better day, Visit the human soul, outlining aye The perfect statue now rough-cast in clay; And with a mournful sigh ye think and say, âThis is the type that was, and passed away!â God holds a flower to you, it only yields The fragrance fading from forgotten fields. âAh, only Eden could have wafted it!â Immortal imagery His hand hath writ Within ye is with revelation lit By secret shinings of the Infinite. âThese are but glimmers of a glory gone!â I tell you they are prophecies of dawn, And glimpses of the life that still goes on. Man hath not fall'n from Heaven, nor been cast Out from some Golden Age lived in the Past! His fall is from the possible Life before ye: His fall is from the Crown of Life held o'er ye: The falling short from an impending glory! Ye stoop by Corpse-light, groping on the ground, And lo! the living God, a-shine all round! Even while I speak there is a quickening, The unrest of a world that feels the spring; The crust o' the Letter cracks; new life takes wing: A strong ground-swell will heave, a wave will break, The Eternal grows more visibly awake. âUpon the verge of sunrise ye but standâ The door of life just open in your hand. Behind you is the slip of space ye passed; Before you an illimitable vast. Not backward point the footprints that ye trace Of those who ran the foremost in the race, With light of God full-shining on their face! Look up, as Children of the Light, and see That ye are bound for immortality, Not passing from it: Heirs of Heaven ye, Not Exiles. God reverses human growth For spirits; they go ripening toward youth For ever. The fair Garden that still gleams Across the desert, miraged in your dreams, Smiles from the spirit, rather than the sod, Wherever hallowed feet of Love have trod; Wherever souls yet walk and talk with God. And Heaven is as near Earth now as when The Angels visibly conversed with Men. 'Neath human roofs still stoopeth the Divine Closer than ever; makes the heart its shrine. âGod hath been gradually forming Man In His own image since the world began, And is for ever working on the soul, Like Sculptor on his Statue, till the whole Expression of the upward life be wrought Into some semblance of the Eternal Thought. Race after Race hath caught its likeness of The Maker as the eyes grew large with love. âYou ask me âhow the lamp of life burns on When all that visibly fed the flame is gone?â âMan does not live alone by visible breath, And He who brings to life will lead through death. Wait yet a little while, and ye shall see The flame was breathed on; fed invisibly: And that its motion springs with force seven-fold When the life-heat is clashed against Death's cold. âYou think of spirit as prison-walled about By substance, marvelling how it can get out! But to my vision radiates the soul Through body; by its pulses lights the whole With life, and makes it luminous as the glass Through which you see but only in spirit pass. The wee babe nestled in the Mother's lap, Feels her soul radiate in love, and wrap It softly in the very heart of bliss, And draw all heaven through it in a kiss. âAs chalk is formed at bottom of the sea From life that sheds its shell continually; As bones are built up out of life's decay, The body is shaped of substance sloughed away From soul in ripening: 'tis a husk which yields The earthy scaffold whereby spirit builds Its heavenly house, that stands when the world-crust Is made of dropped and perished human dust. Spirit is Lord and Master at the death, As in beginning, of its house of breath. And from it the new shape is surely given, When visible form fades, cloud-like, into Heaven. âMan does not live alone by hunger and drouth, But by the breath which kindles from love's mouth: 'Tis breathing spirit makes the body breathe, And sets in outer type the life beneath. So print makes visible the unseen thought To pass away, the miracle being wrought. Life is an inner energy, unfurled In visible shows from an invisible world; Still fed and fed from that Almighty force Of which no science yet hath grasped the source, Whose infant germ from the dead seed reborn, Is greater than a realm of ripened corn. Like worlds warmed into being by their Sun, Ye are embodied by the rays that run Mysteriously across a gulf of night; A bridge of spirit laid in beams of light. And that which is the centre of the blaze Travels in life unseen along the rays. The book will pass; the living Mind works on; The Visible fades; still shines the Eternal sun. âI tell you these things are: I may not show You how: there's much the senses cannot know. Who knows the links of that invisible chain Which runs from soul to soul, from brain to brain, Whereby thought passes into other thought, And out of sound its silent shape is wrought? You see the miracle done before your eyes, And in the flash of spirit to spirit dies The common daylight: visual sense is blind To see how Matter is made quick by Mind. And there's a power in the hidden soul To pass in at the eyes and print its whole Self, in a picture finished infinitely Beyond the portrait that the eyes can see. Eyes ne'er behold your own souls face to face: Your real selves invisibly embrace. âYou know not how a prayer ascends to God. You saw no ladder Angel-feet e'er trod In answer; hear no door turn on the hinge When heaven opens, or the hells impinge Upon the soul with their suggestion dark. Good spirits help, but how you cannot mark: The bridge is still invisible that doth span Your known and unknown: reach from God to Man. âWith labours infinite your Science seeks Footing on inaccessible cloud-peaks. Yet, must the Climbers know that there are things Only attainable at last with wings; That skies will not be scaled howe'er they clasp The solid rock; that heaven thus mocks their grasp. On these they may not speak the final word. On these the great Hereafter must be heard. At best Man doth but darkly draw his light: Each step ye take, each secret wrest from Night, Must furnish food for faith as well as sight. âThe more ye feel the chain whereby ye are spanned, The more its missing links elude the hand. So Saturn's perfect rings, when, closer seen, Are broken with dark gaps of night between! Nor can ye more than mark the Visible shine And in the gloom accept the Hand Divine. âLive fruitfully the life ye may possess With rootage beyond reach of consciousness, And wait till the Unseen in flower blows. âTo find what gems lie hidden where it grows Ye must not pluck the plant up by the root. Wait till its treasures hang in precious fruit. Nor shall we see within the seed concealed That world of wonder by the flower revealed! âThere is no pathway Man hath ever trod By faith or seeking sight but ends in God. Yet 'tis in vain ye look Without to find The inner secrets of the Eternal Mind, Or meet the King on His external Throne. But when ye kneel at heart, and feel so lone, Perchance behind the veil you get the grip And spirit-sign of secret fellowship; Silently as the gathering of a tear The human want will bring the helper near: The very weakness, that is utterest need Of God, will draw Him down with strength indeed. âEnough to know ye live because He lives! And love, because in love Himself He gives! The gift is ever held sufficient sign There is a Giver! And if it be Divine And like the Heaven ye dream, but may not see, Giver Divine and Heaven there must be. âLean nearer to the Heart that beats through night: Its curtain of the dark your veil of light. Peace Halcyon-like to founded Faith is given, And it can float on a reflected Heaven Surely as Knowledge that doth rest at last Isled on its âAtomâ in the unfathomed vast Life-ocean, heaving through the infinite, From out whose dark the shows of being flit, In flashes of the climbing wave's white crest: Some few a moment luminous o'er the rest!â The voice ceased: the form faded in the beam Of dawn, that swam down like the gladsome gleam Of heaven to him who struggles, nearly drowned, And melts to a gold mist the dim green round, And draws him lifeward from the gulf profound. PART VII. Who hath not marked how graciously the Dawn Comes smiling when some stormy night hath gone? As Beauty lifts the heaven of her eyes Full on you large with their serene surprise That you should dream such gentleness could dart The looks that hurt you to the very heart! Calm eyes, that through luxurious reaches roll The richness of their rest upon the soul. So comes the Morning; new heavens rise above, And open wider arms of larger love Than ever: glad blue Ether, with the bliss Of sunshine, laughs and kindles at its kiss. There lie the tears of tempest, softly-bright As Heaven had only rained in drops of light. The air, an overflow of Heaven's own balm, Nought but Earth's music breaks the divine calm. Yet that same Morning looks on ruin and wreck, And soothes a sea that lifeless swept the deck Of some proud ship, and glorifies the wave That landward heaves the mariner's glassy grave; Playfully rippling, shoaling goldenly o'er Dead seamen dimly drifting to the shore! Terribly innocent, Morning laughs on high, While Ocean rocks them with its lullaby. So came the Morning, smiling, crowned with calm, After my night of trouble, breathing balm. Fair Earth with all her night-long-tearful eyes A-sparkle with the soul of new sunrise! On every blade there hung a drop of dew, And every drop a live star shimmered through: All phantoms of the night by shadowy stealth Retired with Darkness from our world of health; All life unshrouded, to Heaven's influence bare, Took wings of morning in the open air. Our world, a warm safe nest of happy souls, Basked in the brightness as the lily lolls In whiteness bosomed on the sunny stream, Whose ripples lip her where she lies a-dream. The stream, that crept a river of death by night, Full of dark secrets, ran a river of light! Such sense of rest to all glad things was given, As earth were cradle to the peace of heaven. A more than common freshness fed the breath Of being; there was no least taint of death. My nightmare over, I would dream no more Of murder and the charnel at life's core; Or nameless creatures that may haunt old graves Bat-like, and flit from out lone, twilight caves. Green earth, glad heaven, gladly vied to win Thought out-of-doors, yet would it brood within, Sullen and shy as fish that will not rise To any tempting lure of feathered flies, But haunt the pool where, horribly quiet, lies A dead child, with its wide-awake blue eyes. Lonely I wandered in my garden-ground, Musing on Life, the Death's-head rosily crowned, And of the mystery that shrouds us round, And of the mournful possibility That, in some blindness, we may lose the key Which to the keeping of each soul is given To ope the door, and so be shut from Heaven; Raking the ashes and the dust of death, Long after we have done with human breath; And of the features printed on my brain In vision that would evermore remain, And, any instant, sinister and swart, From out the light, at turn of eye, might start; And I should see him! as 'neath the Tunnel's are, Where, down the shaft, day lightens through the dark, Some chosen victim momently may mark His murderer, with those snaky eyes at work Fixed on him; in whose spark malignant lurk Cold fires of death drawn inward for the spring; The dagger-flash leaps in their glittering! So, till its horrors almost lived to sight, My spirit brooded o'er the bygone night; Reflecting all the strife in upper air, As you have seen, by some sea-margin, where The circling sea-bird hovers, dreamily slow, In likeness of the wave that sways below, The Spirit of its motion on the wing: Over that night my mind kept hovering. At length the growing image of my thought To some such final shape as this was wroughtâ From end to end of things we may not see, Nor square the circle of Eternity; But, I can not believe in endless hell And heaven side by side. How could one dwell Among the Saved, for thinking of the Lost? With such a lot the Blest would suffer most. Sitting at feast all in a Golden Home, That towered over dungeon-grates of Doom, My heart would ache for all the lost that go To wail and weep in everlasting woe: Through all the music I must hear the moan, Too sharp for all the harps of Heaven to drown. I cannot think of Life apart from Him Who is the life, from cell to Seraphim: And, if Hell flame unquenchably, must be The life of hell to all eternity! A God of Love must expiate the stain Of Sin Himself, by suffering endless pain; Sit with eternal desolation round His feet; His head with happy heavens crowned. From Him the strength immortal must be sent, By which the soul could bear the punishment. I cannot think He gave us power to wring From one brief life eternal suffering: And prove the Infinite's own limiting! If this were so the Heavens must surely weep, Till Hell were drowned in one salt vast, sea-deep. Forgive me, Lord, if wrongly I divine; I dare not think Thy pity less than mine. I cannot image Heaven as Triumph-Car, That rolleth red and reeking from the war, Upborne on wheels of torture whirling round With writhing souls for ever broke and bound! God save me from that Heaven of the Elect, Who half rejoice to count the numbers wrecked, Because, such full weight to the balance given, Sends up the scale that lands them safe in heaven; Who some fallen Angel would devoutly greet And praise the Lord for another vacant seat, And the proud Saved, exulting, soar the higher, The lower that the Lost sank in hell-fire. I think Heaven will not shut for evermore, Without a knocker left upon the door, Lest some belated wanderer should come Heart-broken, asking just to die at home, So that the Father will at last forgive, And looking on His face that soul shall live. I think there will be Watchmen through the night, Lest any, afar off, turn them to the light; That He who loved us into life must be A Father infinitely Fatherly, And, groping for Him, these shall find their way From outer dark, through twilight, into day. I could not sing the song of Harvest Home, Thinking of those poor souls that never come; I could not joy for Harvest gathered in, If any souls, like tares and twitch of sin, Were flung out by the Farmer to the fire, Whose smoke of torment, rising high and higher, Should fill the universe for evermore. I could not dance along the crystal floor Through which the damned looked up at Paradise, For ever fixed, like fishes frozen in ice. Such mournful eyes from out their night would gleam And haunt for ever all my happy dream! I could not take my fill for thinking of Those empty places in the heart of Love. The New World's poorest emigrant will lend A kindly hand to help a poorer friend. And I must pray to God from out my bliss For those who are beyond all help but Hisâ Pray and repray, the same old prayer anew; Forgive them, Lord, they know not what they do. Because they were so utterly accurst, Self-doomed, that bitterness would be the worst. O look down on them from Thy place above, The look of pity, Lord, half-way to love! Mere human love, in this, its narrow sphere, Can never think of those it once held dear, Who, down the darkened way will pull apart, But with a pitying eye, an aching heart. And still, as less the beckoning hand they heed, The strength of Love grows with their greater need; The less they heed, the more it yearns to save. And shall this love be dwarfed beyond the grave, To lose, on wings, its feet-attainÃ¨d height? Better its blindness, than the eye of light That coldly down on endless hell could glance With all its mortal sympathies in trance. Or will some Lethean wave the soul caress, And numb it into dull forgetfulness; Washing away all memory of distress That others feel, while we but lift the hand To pluck and eat the lotus of the land, And those far wailings of the world of tears Come mellowed into music for our ears, With just the zestful dash of discord given, That makes the pleasure pungentâperfects Heaven? 'Tis hard to read the Handwriting Divine; The vanishing up-stroke so invisibly fine! There must be issues that we do not see. The whole horizon of Futurity Is nowise visible from where we stand; We are but dwellers in a lowly land: We think the sun doth set, the sun doth rise, And yet our world's but turning in the skies. Seen from our lower level there must pass Mysteries, so high and starry, we but glass Them darkly, as we strain our mortal sight, While 'twixt our souls and them there stands the night. And then we scratch upon our window-pane, Dimming its clearness, and we are so fain To read our own imaginations fond, For the true figures of the world beyond. We model from the human life, and so Feature the future from the face we know. 'Tis always sunless one side of our globe, And thus we fashion the Eternal's robe. God made Man in His image, but our plan's To mould and make God's image in the Man's; And if my thought be human as the rest, At least the likeness shall be Man's at best. Our Science grasps with its transforming hand; Makes real half the tales of wonder-land. We turn the deathliest fetor to perfume; We give decay new life and rosy bloom; Change filthy rags to paper virgin white; Make pure in spirit what was foul to sight. Even dead, recoiling force, to a fairy gift Of help is turned, and taught to deftly lift. How can we think God hath no crucible Save some Black Country of a burning Hell? Or the great ocean of Almighty power, No scope to take the life-stream from our shore, Muddy and dark, and make it pure once more? Dear God, it seems to me that Love must be The Missionary of Eternity! Must still find work, in worlds beyond the grave, So long as there's a single soul to save; Gather the jewels that flash Godward in The dark, down-trodden, toad-like head of Sin; That all divergent lines at length will meet, To make the clasping round of Love complete; The rift 'twixt Sense and Spirit will be healed, Before creation's work is crowned and sealed; Evil shall die like dung about the root Of Good, or climb converted into fruit! The discords cease, and all their strife shall be Resolved in one vast peaceful harmony: That all these accidents of Time and breath Shall bear no black seal of a Second Death: And, freed from branding heats that burn in Time, The lost Black Race shall whiten in that clime: All blots of error bleached in Heaven's sight; All life's perplexing colours lost in light: That Thou hast power to work out every stain, That purifying is the end of Pain; And, waking, we shall know what we but dream Dimly, our darkness touched by morning's gleam; There is no punishment but to redeem; And here, or There, the penitent thrill must leaven The earthiest soul, and wing it toward Heaven; That when the Angel-Reapers shall up-sheave The harvest, Angel-Gleaners will not leave One least small grain of goodâand there are none So evil but some precious germ lives on,â The grimiest gutter crawling by the way Still hath its reflex of the face of Day; And all the seeds divine foredoomed by fate To bear blind blossoms here shall germinate, And have another chance, in other place, Where tears of gratitude and dews of grace Shall warm and quicken to the feeblest root, Till in Thy garden they are ripe for fruit: For all who have made shipwreck on that shore Another outfit and one venture more. So shall we find the Dark of our old Earth Twin with the eternal Daylight from the birth, And trodden in the grave-dust we shall see The serpent-symbol of Eternity, That only maketh ends meet, head and tail, A world all blessing with a world all bale. Thus, in its maze, my mind went round and round,â Like him, lost in the Bush, who thought he found The pathway that he sought, because he beat His track with constant tread of his own feet,â As round the dew-drenched garden-walks I went Till, pausing, all unconscious of intent, Nigh where a greenery of Syringas grew, And, shedding shadow round, there leaned a Yew,â Sombrely-ancient watcher by the tomb! A Nest of Thrushes the live heart o' the gloom; I saw the earth was cracked, where recent rain Had crushed and crumbled in a new-made drain, And human bones were plainly peering through, As if Death grinned and show'd a tooth or two! I searched, and, ere the ghastly work was done, Had gathered half a tiny skeleton, That had been once a Child. And then it came On me that in my dream I saw the same, And had been warned to calcine them in flame, And pound them small as is the finest rust, And on the winds of heaven fling the dust. I did it, and, although that soul, self-cursed, Still walks the darkness, we had passed the worst, And there was peace o' nights at the Haunted Hurst. 1869.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND SERIES. LADY MARIAN. In her Ancestral Tree's old smiling shade, Spenser and Milton sang, and Shakspeare played. I cannot prophesy immortal fame, And endless honour for my Lady's name Through my poor Verse; but it shall surely give All that it gathers long as it may live. She heard my Children singing in the street, And smiled down on them starry-clear and sweet, But half-way up in Heaven, and far from me, As Shakspeare's Juliet in her balcony; A radiant Creature all too rare to stay, With waving white hand she would pass away! Now I have seen her; heard her voice To-day, And touched her hand; enriched my life for aye: The thought in sunbeams gloriously upsprings, To smile out in the saddest face of things. After the gloom is gone, the worst is passed, I know you, my good Fairy, found at last! Though poor, and grim to tears, our lot might be, We had proud visions in our poverty! My Princess too, with darkly-sparkling e'en, As I lay dreaming, over me would lean; And now the silken clue of hidden power, Hath led me to her beauty in its bower. Lady! Giorgione should have painted you With live warm flesh-tints golden through and through; The sun-soul making luminous its prison With splendours rarer than have ever risen; Bird-peeps of brightnessâdawn-dewâsmiling fireâ Full of all freshness as a spring-wood choir; A glow and glory of impetuous blood; Brave spirits that crowd all sail to take the flood Of large, abounding life, that in the sun Heaves flashing, with a frolic fringe of fun: A happy wit; creative genius, proved In Pictures that Angelico would have loved: A stately soul: yet with a laugh that brings Echoes from Girlhood's heaven as it rings! And that fine spirit of motion's airy charm, Which hovers glancing round the flower of form: A lofty lady of a proud old race, Recklessly splendid in her gifts and grace. Yet, as the life of some tall, towery tree Climbs till atop it laughs exultingly With all its leaves, using its pride of place To look both earth and heav'n full in the face! Thusâup through bole and branch of wealth and blood, Breaks out her noble natural Womanhood. My Lady Marian, you are good and true, Most bountiful and gracious as the dew; And glad Heartsâwinged with Blessingsâfollow you Far as the Earth is green, or Heaven is blue; But, dear my lady, there is work to do In England yet, and rare good work for you. Why leave your own free air, and English Home, For Parisâthat Slave-Dancerâor for Rome? With all their lustres, dazzlingly displayed, They cannot match the sweetness of our shade; Our leafier pathways cool with gladder green; Our hearts, whose heavings lift you upâour Queen. Much Mother's Milk wants sweetening with the Balms That you can bring; much need of more than Alms! In eyes wide open souls lie fast asleep; With daylight on the face hearts darkly weep: Our world has many a ward where wounds and wails Cry for a thousand Florence Nightingales. I know that Knowledge through our Shire doth trail With slow illumination of a snail! But still we dream of some bright better day, And while we sleep the great Dawn comes our way. Think how long Nature brooded over Earth Before she quickened for her noblest Birth! O, they shall bless you down in pit and den,â Transforming slowly into Women and Men; And smile, as leaves out-smile in first Spring-hours, With livelier green, while fall the singing showers; Or as the Winter mosses round your trees Look up and smile at their good influences. Your pardon, Lady, if my unskilled word, Like a bad player, should mistake the chord! No churlish charge, no plea of parasite, Is mine; but leal heart-service of a knight Who in old days had fought for you and bled; Going to death as 'twere a bridal bed. Our lost âMaid Marianâ bore your name, and she Yet works a very tender ministry; And, somehow, when of her we sit and think, Our hearts touch you by an invisible link. Sacred to her, my sadder verses take; And kindly think of them for Marian's sake. Room for my Sea-Kings too, your heart will make, From young Sir William Peel, to old King Hake. You have the spirit born of the salt spray That snuffs the sea-breeze meadowy miles away; The Norse blood running seaward round the world, That leaves the Celtic in the Homestead curled. You love our Heroes! and you might have been In battle-need our Boadicea Queen; And stood up to the full majestic height In your War-chariot beckoning on the fight! A famous victory you would have wrought, Or with your Heroes fallen as you fought. 1858. THE SEA-KINGS. THE NORSEMAN. A swarthy strength with face of light; As dark sword-iron is beaten bright; A brave, frank look, with health aglow, Bonny blue eyes and open brow; His friend he welcomes, heart-in-hand, But foot to foot his foe must stand: A Man who will face, to his last breath, The sternest facts of life and death: This is the brave old Norseman. The wild wave-motion weird and strange Rocks in him! seaward he must range; His life is just a mighty lust To wear away with use, not rust! Though bitter wintry-cold the storm, The fire within him keeps him warm: Kings quiver at his flag unfurled, The Sea-King's master of the world! All-conquering rides the Norseman. He hides at heart of his rough life, A world of sweetness for the Wife; From his rude breast a Babe may press Soft milk of human tenderness,â Make his eyes water, his heart dance, And sunrise in his countenance: In merriest mood his ale he quaffs By firelight, and with jolly heart laughs The blithe, great-hearted Norseman. But when the Battle-Trumpet rings, His soul, a war-horse clad with wings! Will drink delight in with the breath Of Battle and the dust of death: The Axes redden; spring the sparks; Blood-soaken grow the gray mail-sarks; Such blows might batter, as they fell, Heaven's gate, or burst the booms of hell! So fights the fearless Norseman. The Norseman's King must stand up tall, If he would be head over all; Mainmast of Battle! when the plain Is miry-red with bloody rain! And grip his weapon for the fight, Until his knuckles grin tooth-white; The banner-staff he bears is best If double handful for the rest: When âfollow meâ cries the Norseman. Valiant and true, as Sagas tell, The Norsemen hated lies like hell; Hardy from cradle to the grave, 'Twas their religion to be brave: Great, silent fighting men, whose words Were few, soon said, and out with Swords! One saw his heart cut from his side Living, and smiled; and smiling, died The unconquerable Norseman. They swam the flood; they strode in flame; Nor quailed when the Valkyrie came To kiss the chosen for her charms, With âRest, my Hero, in mine arms.â Their spirits through a grim wide wound, The Norse door-way to heaven found; And borne upon the battle-blast, Into the hall of Heroes passed: And there was crowned the Norseman. The Norseman wrestled with old Rome, For Freedom in our Island-Home; He taught us how to ride the sea With hempen bridle, horse of tree: The Norseman stood with Robin Hood By Freedom in the merry green wood, When William ruled the English land With cruel heart and bloody hand. For Freedom fights the Norseman. Still in our race the Norse king reigns; His best blood beats along our veins; With his old glory we can glow, And surely sail where he could row: Is danger stirring? from its sleep Our War-dog wakes his watch to keep, Stands with our Banner over him, True as of old and stern and grim! Come on, you'll find the Norseman. When Swords are gleaming you shall see The Norseman's face flash gloriously, With look that makes the foeman reel; His mirror from of old was steel! And still he wields, in Battle's hour, The old Thor's hammer of Norse power; Strikes with a desperate arm of might, And at the last tug turns the fight: For never yields the Norseman. OLD KING HAKE. Got by the Sea on a rocky coast Was old King Hake; Where inner fire and outer frost Brave virtue make! He was a hero in the old Blood-letting days; An iron hero of Norse mould, And warring ways. He lived according to the light That lighted him; Then strode into the eternal night, Resolved and grim. His grip was stern for free sword-play, When men were mown; His feet were rough-shod for the day Of treading down. When angry, out the blood would start With old King Hake; Not sneak in dark caves of the heart, Where curls the snake, And secret Murder's hiss is heard Ere the deed be done: He wove no web of wile and word; He bore with none. When sharp within its sheath asleep Lay his good sword, He held it royal work to keep His kingly word. A man of valour, bloody and wild, In Viking need; And yet of firelight feeling mild As honey-mead. Once in his youth, from farm to farm, Collecting Scatt, He gathered gifts and welcomes warm; And one night sat, With hearts all happy for his throneâ Wishing no higherâ Where Peasant faces merrily shone Across the fire: Their Braga-bowl was handed round By one fair girl: The Sea-King looked and thought, âI've found My hidden pearl.â Her wavy hair was golden-fair, With sunbeams curled; Her eyes clear blue as heaven, and there Lay his new world. He drank out of the mighty horn, Strong, stinging stuff; Then wiped his manly mouth unshorn With hand as rough, And kissed her; drew her to his side, With loving mien, Saying, âIf they will make you a Bride, I will make you a Queen.â And round her waist she felt an arm; For in those days A waist could feel: 'twas lithe and warm, And wore no stays. âHow many brave deeds have you done?â She asked her wooer, Counting the arm's gold rings: they won One victory more. The blood of joy looked rich and red Out of his face; And to his manly strength he wed Her maiden grace. 'Twas thus King Hake struck royal root In homely ground; And healthier buds with goodlier fruit His branches crowned. But Hake could never bind at home His spirit free; It grew familiar with the foam Of many a sea. A rare good blade whose way was rent In gaps of war, And wore no gem for ornament But notch and scar. In day of battle and hour of strife, Cried old King Hake: âKings live for honour and not long life.â Then would he break Right through their circle of shields, to reach Some Chief of a race That never yielded ground, but each Died in his place. There the old Norseman towered tall Above the rest A head and shoulders, like King Saul; They saw his crest Toss, where the war-wave reared and rode O'er mounds of dead, Till all the battle-dust was trod A miry red. For Odin, in the glad wide blue Of heaven, would laugh With sunrise, and the ruddy dew Of slaughter quaff. But, 'twas the bravest, goodliest show, To see him sit, With his Long-serpent all aglow, And steering it For the hot heart of fiercest fight, A grewsome shape! The dragon-head rose, glancing bright, And all agape: Over the calm blue water it came Writhingly on, As half in sea and half in flame, It swam, and shone. The sunlit shields link scale to scale From stem to stern, Over the Steersman's head the tail Doth twist and burn: With oars all moved at once, it makes Low hoverings; Half walks the water, and half takes The air with wings. The war-horns bid the fight begin With death-grip good: King Hake goes at the foremost, in His Bare-Sark mood: A twelvemonth's taxes spent in spears Hurled in an hour! But in that host no spirit fears The hurtling shower. And long will many a Mother and Wife Wait, weary at home, Ere from that mortal murderous strife Their darlings come. Hake did not seek to softly die, With Child and Wife: He bore his head in death as high As in his life. Glittering in eye, and grim in lip, He bade them make Ready for sailing his War-Ship, That he, King Hake, The many-wounded, gray, and old, His day being done,â He, the Norse warrior, brave and bold, Might die like one. And chanting an old battle-song, Thrilling and weird, His soul vibrating, shook his long Majestic beard: The gilded battle-axe, still red, In his right hand; His shield on arm, his helm on head, They helped him stand, And girded him with his good sword; Then, so attired, With his dead warriors all abroad, The Ship he fired, And lay down with his heroes dead, On deck to die; Still singing, drooped his gray old head, With face to sky. The wind blew seawards; gloriously The death-pyre glowed: On his last Viking voyage he Exulting rode: Floating afar between the Isles, To his last home, Where open-armed Valhalla smiles, And bids him come. There, as a sinking Sunset dies Down in the West, The fire flamed out; the rude heart lies At restâat rest, And sleeping in his Ocean-bed, That burial-place Most royal for the kingly dead O' the old sea-race! So the Norse noble of renown, With fearless pride, His flaming crown of death pulled down; And so he died. THE BANNER-BEARER OF KING OLAF. Thord Folason carried King Olaf's flag; Not the man to loiter or lag! However they hurried who bore the brunt O' the battle, there was Thord in front. Not the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, who carried King Olaf's flag. Great joy of the onset Folason had, As Banner-bearer at Stiklestad! Mighty and free was his battle-play, Cleaving and clearing an onward way. Not the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, who carried King Olaf's flag. He was the bulwark at Olaf's side; Or, in front, the foremost in turning the tide Of battle, and breasting it rooted as rocks, Bearing his Banner high over the shocks. Never the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, who carried King Olaf's flag. He got a death-thrust in the thick of the fight, Gave it back,âand suddenly felt 'twas night; He could see no longer to clear a space. Then his spirit flew out in the Enemy's face! Never the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, the bearer of Olaf's flag. As he plunged head-first on the field full-length, He gathered his last remaining strength; Biting his lip and holding his breath,â 'Twas his last,âhe fell all his weight in death. Never the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, who carried King Olaf's flag. He fell, but, in falling, stuck fast in the ground His Banner, a-waving to all around, Bearing the battle up, beckoning on To keep them abreast of it when he was gone. Never the man to loiter or lag Was Thord, the bearer of Olaf's flag. When the battle was over at last, And Thord, still a leader in death, had passed, They found his body, with teeth through lip, His flag-staff clutched as fast in his grip, Stemming the tide like a fallen Crag: Living or dead he upheld the flag. SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE'S LAST FIGHT. Our second Richard Lion-Heart, In days of Great Queen Bess, He did this deed, he played this part, With true old nobleness; And wrath heroic that was nursed To bear the fiercest battle-burst, When maddened Foes should wreak their worst. Signalled the English Admiral, âWeigh or cut anchors.â For A Spanish Fleet bore down, in all The majesty of war, Athwart our tack for many a mile, As there we lay off Florez Isle, With Crews half sick, all tired of toil. Eleven of our Twelve ships escaped; Sir Richard stood alone! Though they were Three-and-Fifty sailâ A hundred men to oneâ The old Sea-Rover would not run, So long as he had man or gun; But he could die when all was done. âThe Devil's broken loose, my lads, In shape of Popish Spain; And we must sink him in the sea, Or hound him home again. Now, you old Sea-Dogs, show your paws! Have at them tooth and nail and claws!â And then his long, bright blade he draws. The deck was cleared, the Boatswain blew; The grim Sea-Lions stand; The death-fires lit in every eye, The burning match in hand. With mail of glorious intent All hearts were clad; and in they went, A force that cut through where 'twas sent. âPush home, my hardy Pikemen, For we play a desperate part; To-day, my Gunners, let them feel The pulse of England's heart! They shall remember long that we Once lived; and think how shamefully We shook them!âOne to Fifty-three.â With face of one who cheerily goes To meet his doom that day, Sir Richard sprang upon his foes; The foremost gave him way: His round shot smashed them through and through, At every flash white splinters flew, And madder grew his fighting few. They clasp the little Ship Revenge, As in the arms of fire; They run aboard her, six at once; Hearts beat, hot guns leap higher. Through bloody gaps the boarders swarm, But still our English stay the storm, The bulwark in their breast is firm. Ship after ship, like broken waves That wash up on a rock, Those mighty Galleons fall back foiled, And shattered from the shock. With fire she answers all their blows; Again, again in pieces strows The girdle round her as they close. Through all that night the great white storm Of worlds in silence rolled; Sirius with green-azure sparkle, Mars in ruddy gold. Heaven looked with stillness terrible Down on a fight most fierce and fellâ A sea transfigured into hell. Some know not they are wounded till 'Tis slippery where they stand; Then each one tighter grips his steel, As 'twere Salvation's hand. Grim faces glow through lurid night With sweat of spirit shining bright: Only the dead on deck turn white. At daybreak the flame-picture fades In blackness and in blood; There, after fifteen hours of fight, The unconquered Sea-King stood Defying all the power of Spain: Fifteen Armadas hurled in vain, And fifteen hundred foemen slain. About that little bark Revenge, The baffled Spaniards ride At distance. Two of their good ships Were sunken at her side; The rest lie round her in a ring, As round the dying Lion-king The Dogs afraid of his death-spring. Our pikes all broken, powder spent, Sails, masts to shivers blown; And with her dead and wounded crew The ship was going down! Sir Richard's wounds were hot and deep. Then cried he, with a proud, pale lip, âHo, Master Gunner, sink the ship! âMake ready now, my Mariners, To go aloft with me, That nothing to the Spaniard May remain of victory. They cannot take us, nor we yield; So let us leave our battle-field, Under the shelter of God's shield.â They had not heart to dare fulfil The stern Commander's word: With swelling hearts and welling eyes, They carried him aboard The Spaniards' ship; and round him stand The Warriors of his wasted band: Then said he, feeling death at hand, âHere die I, Richard Grenville, With a joyful and quiet mind; I reach a Soldier's end, I leave A Soldier's fame behind, Who for his Queen and Country fought, For Honour and Religion wrought, And died as a true Soldier ought.â Earth never returned a worthier trust For hand of Heaven to take, Since Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Was cast into the lake, And the King's grievous wounds were dressed, And healed, by weeping Queens, who blessed, And bore him to a valley of rest. Old Heroes who could grandly do, As they could greatly dare; A vesture, very glorious, Their shining spirits wear, Of noble deeds! God give us grace, That we may see such face to face, In our great day that comes apace. 1859. ROBERT BLAKE. Our Happy Warrior! of a race To whom are richly given Great glory and peculiar grace, Because in league with Heaven. Not that the mortal course they trod Was free from briar and thorn; Who wears the arrow-mark of God, Must first the wound have borne. O like a Sailor Saint was he, Our Sea-king! grave and sweet In temper after victory, Or cheerful in defeat; And men would leave their quiet home To follow in his wake, And fight in fire, or float in foam, For love of Robert Blake. Like that drumhead of Zitska's skin, Thrills his heroic name; And how the salt-sea-sparkle in Us, flashes at his fame! His picture in our hearts' best books Still keeps its pride of place, From which a lofty spirit looks With an unfading face; The face as of an Angel, who Might live his Boyhood here! And yet how deadly grand it grew, When Wrong drew darkening near. All ridged, and ready trenched for war The fair frank brow was bent, Then shone like sudden Scimitar, The lion-lineament. Behold him, with his gallant band, On leaguered Lyme's red beach. Shoulder to shoulder, see them stand, At Taunton in the breach. Safe through the battle-shocks he went, With sword-sweep stern and wide; Strode the grim heaps as Death had lent Him his White Horse to ride. âGive in! our toils you cannot break; The Lion is in the net! Famine fights for us.â âNo,â said Blake, âMy boots I have not ate.â He smiled across the bitter cup; He gripped his good Sword-heft: âI should not dream of giving up While such a meal is left.â Where trumpets blow and streamers flow, Behold him, calm and proud, Bear down upon the bravest foe, A bursting thunder-cloud. Foremost of all the host that strove To crowd Death's open door, In giant mood his way he clove; Aye first to go before. And though the battle-lightning blazed, The thunders roar and roll, He to Immortal Beauty raised A statue with his soul. And never did the Greeks of old Mirror in marble rare A Wrestler of so fine a mould, An Athlete half so fair. Homeward the dying Sea-king turns From his last famous fight, For England's dear green hills he yearns At heart, and strains his sight. The old cliffs loom out gray and grand, The old War-ship glides on, With one last wave life tries to land, Falls seaward, and is gone. With that last leap to touch the coast, He passed into his rest, And Blake's unwearying arms were crossed Upon his martial breast. And while our England waits, and twines For him her latest wreath, His is a crown of stars that shines From out the dusk of death. For him no pleasant age of ease, To wear what youth could win; For him no Children round his knees, To gather his harvest in. But with a soul serene, he takes Whatever lot may come; And such a life of labour makes A glorious going home. Famous old Trueheart, dead and gone, Long shall his glory grow, Who never turned his back upon A friend, nor face from foe. He made them fear old England's name Wherever it was heard, He put her proudest foes to shame; And Peace smiled on his Sword. With lofty courage, loftier love, He died for England's sake; And 'mid the loftiest lights above, Shines our illustrious Blake.â And shall shine! Glory of the West, And Beacon for the seas; While Britain bares its sailor breast To battle or to breeze. Great Sailor on the seas of strife; Victor by land and wave; Brave liver of a gallant life; Lord of a glorious grave; True Soldier set on earthly hill As Sentinel of heaven; A King who keeps his kingdom till The last award be given. Till she forget her old Sea-fame, Shall England honour him, And keep the grave-grass from his name Till her old eyes be dim: And long as free waves folding round, Brimful with blessing break, At heart she holds him, calm and crowned, Immortal Robert Blake. AN OLD MAN-O'-WAR'S-MAN'S YARN. Ay, ay, good Neighbours, I have seen Him! sure as God's my life; One of his chosen crew I've been; Haven't I, old Good Wife? God bless your dear eyes! didn't you vow To marry me any weather, If I came back with limbs enow To keep my soul together? Brave as a Lion was our Nel, And gentle as a lamb: It warms my blood once more to tell The taleâgray as I amâ It makes the old life in me climb, It sets my soul a-swim; I live twice over every time That I can talk of him. You should have seen him as he trod The deck, our joy, and pride; You should have seen him, like a God Of storm, his War-horse ride! You should have seen him as he stood Fighting for our good land, With all the iron of soul and blood Turned to a sword in hand. Our best beloved of all the brave That ever for Freedom fought; And all his wonders of the wave For Fatherland were wrought! He was the manner of man to show How victories may be won; So swift, you scarcely saw the blow; You lookedâthe deed was done. He sailed his Ships for work; he bore His sword for battle-wear; His creed was âBest man to the fore;â And he was always there. Up any peak of peril where There was but room for one: The only thing he did not dare Was any death to shun. The Nelson-touch his men he taught, And his great stride to keep; His faithful fellows round him fought Ten thousand heroes deep. With a red pride of life, and hot For him, their blood ran free; They âminded not the showers of shot, No more than peas,â said he. Napoleon saw our Sea-king thwart His landing on our Isle; He gnashed his teeth, he gnawed his heart, At Nelson of the Nile, Who set his fleet in flames, to light The Lion to his prey, And lead Destruction through the night Upon his dreadful way. Around the world he drove his game, And ran his glorious race; Nor rested till he hunted them From off the Ocean's face; Like that old War-dog who, till death, Clung to the vessel's side Till hands were lopped, then with his teeth He held on till he died. Ay, he could do the deeds that set Old Fighters' hearts afire; The edge of every spirit whet, And every arm inspire. Yet I have seen upon his face The tears that, as they roll, Show what a light of saintly grace May clothe a Sailor's soul. And when our Darling went to meet Trafalgar's Judgment-day, The people knelt down in the street To bless him on his way. He felt the Country of his love Watching him from afar; It saw him through the battle move; His heaven was in that star. Magnificently glorious sight It was in that great dawn! Like one vast sapphire flashing light, The sea, just breathing, shone. Their ships, fresh-painted, stood up tall And stately: ours were grim And weatherworn, but one and all In rare good fighting trim. Our spirits were all flying light, And into battle sped, Straining for it on wings of might, With feet of springy tread; The light of battle on each face; Its lust in every eye; Our Sailor-blood at swiftest pace To catch the victory nigh. His proudly-wasted face, wave-worn, Was loftily serene; I saw the brave, bright spirit burn There, all too plainly seen; As though the sword this time was drawn Forever from the sheath; And when its work to-day was done, All would be dark in death. His eye shone like a lamp of night Set in the porch of power; The deed unborn was burning bright Within him at that hour! His purpose, welded at white-heat, Cried like some visible Fate, âTo-day we must not merely beat: We will Annihilate.â He smiled to see the Frenchman show His reckoning for retreat, With Cadiz port on his lee-bow; And held him then half beat. They flew no Colours, till we drew Them out to strike with there! Old Victory, for a prize or two, Had flags enough to spare. Mast-high the famous signal ran; Breathless we caught each word: âEngland expects that every man Will do his duty.â Lord, You should have seen our faces! heard Us cheering, row on row; Like men before some furnace stirred To a fiery fearful glow! 'Twas Collingwood our Lee line led, And cut their centre through. âSee how he goes in!â Nelson said, As his first broadside flew, And near four hundred foemen fall. Up went another cheer. âAh, what would Nelson give,â said Coll âBut to be with us here!â We grimly kept our vanward path; Over us hummed their shot; But, silently, we reined our wrath, Held on, and answered not, Till we could grip them face to face, And pound them for our own, Or hug them in a war-embrace, Till one or both went down. How calm he was! when first he felt The sharp edge of that fight. Cabined with God alone he knelt; The prayer still lay in light Upon his face, that used to shine In battle,âflash with life, As though the glorious blood ran wine, Dancing with that wild strife. âFight for us, Thou Almighty One! Give victory once again! And if I fall, Thy will be done: Amen, Amen, Amen!â With such a voice he bade good-bye; The mournfullest old smile wore: âFarewell! God bless you, Blackwood, I Shall never see you more.â And four hours after, he had done With winds and troubled foam. The Reaper was borne dead upon Our load of Harvest-homeâ Not till he knew the Old Flag flew Alone on all the deep; Then said he, âHardy, is that you? Kiss me.â And fell asleep. Well, 'twas his chosen death below The deck in triumph trod; 'Tis well. A Sailor's soul should go From his good ship to God. He would have chosen death aboard, From all the crowns of rest; And burial with the Patriot sword Upon the Victor's breast. âNot a great sinner.â No, dear heart, God grant in our death-pain, We may have played as well our part, And feel as free from stain. We see the spots on such a star, Because it burned so bright; But on the other side they are All lost in greater light. And so he went upon his way, A higher deck to walk, Or sit in some eternal day, And of the old time talk With Sailors old, who, on that coast, Welcome the homeward bound; Where many a gallant soul we've lost And Franklin will be found. Where amidst London's roar and moil That cross of peace upstands, Like Martyr with his heavenward smile, And flame-lit, lifted hands, There lies the dark and mouldered dust; But that magnanimous And manly Seaman's soul, I trust, Lives on in some of us. TURNER'S TEMERAIRE. Another glorious tale to tell, When nights are long and mirk; How well she fought our fight, how well She did our England's work; The French ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire. Bravely over the breezy blue They went to do or die; Proudly upon herself she drew The Battle's burning eye: Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire. Round her the glory fell in flood, From Nelson's loving smile, When, raked with fire, she ran with blood In England's hour of trial! Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! And when our darling of the Sea Sank dying on his deck, With her revenging thunders she Struck down his foeâa wreck. Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! Her day now draweth to its close With solemn sunset crowned; To death her crested beauty bows, The night is folding round Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! No more the big heart in her breast Will heave from wave to wave. Weary and war-worn, ripe for rest, She glideth to her grave. Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! In her dumb pathos desolate As night among the dead! Yet wearing an exceeding weight Of glory on her head. Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! Good-bye! good-bye! Old Temeraire, A sad and proud good-bye! The stalwart spirit that did wear Your sternness, shall not die. Our good ship Temeraire! See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! Through battle-blast, and storm of shot, Your banner we shall bear; And fight for it like those who fought Our good ship Temeraire. The grand old Temeraire. See her tugged to her last berth, The fighting Temeraire! SIR ROBERT'S SAILOR SON. Our Country has no need to raise The Ghost of glories gone; Such Heroes dying in our days Still pass the live torch on. Brave blood as bright a crimson gleams, Still burns as goodly a zeal; The old heroic radiance beams In men like William Peel. So mild in peace, so stern in war, He walked our English way, Just one of Shakespeare's Warriors for A weary working day. With beautiful bravery clothÃ¨d on, And such high moral grace, The flash of rare soul-armour shone Out of his noble face! His Sailors loved him so on deck, So cheery was his call, They leapt on land, and in his wake Followed him, guns and all. For, as a battle-brand white-hot, His Spirit grew and glowed, When in his swift War-chariot The Avenger rose and rode. Sleep, Sailor-Darling, true and brave, With our dead Soldiers sleep! That so the Land you lived to save, You shall have died to keep. You may have wished the dear Sea-blue To have folded round your breast, But God had other work for you, And other place of rest. We might have reached you with our wreath If living; but laid low, You grow so grand! and after death The dearness deepens so! To have gone so soon, so loved to have died, So young to wear that crown, We think. But with such thrills of pride As shake the last tears down. God rest you, gallant Captain Peel, With those whom England leaves Scattered as still she plies her steel, But we glean up in sheaves. We'll talk of you on land, a-board, Till Boys shall feel they are Men, And forests of hands clutch at this Sword Death gives us back again. Our old Norse Fathers speak in you, Speak with their strange sea-charm, That sets our hearts a-beating to The music of the storm. There comes a Spirit from the deep, The salt wind waves its wings, That rouses from its Inland sleep The blood of the old Sea Kings. THE STOKER'S STORY. Safe, once more, in Old England: That Heaven of a Sailor's dream! No place like jolly Old England, For a fellow to blow off the steam. Bad luck to the Lubbers who sent us to die, Or live on four ounces a day; Running us out betwixt Sea and Sky In that devil-may-care kind of way! All who ever had sailed in her Found the MegÅra unlucky. Hearts of the stoutest have quailed in her; She was miserable and mucky. Curses enough to sink her, If curses can cling, she bore: She was rusted, rotten, rat-forsaken, Cankered and cursed to the core. Why did I sail? Well, you see, Sir, Somehow, a way we have got, To stick to our duty, nor shirk it Should we chance to draw a bad lot. Some big-wig aloft overlooked the Ship, It wasn't for us to complain. And so, all round, 'twas a stiff upper lip, If we never saw England again. I think God Almighty picked the weather, From Queenstown to the Cape: But strive as we might to pull together, We never got things ship-shape: And you caught a look in the eyes of some Who were married, that tried not to tell Tales of the heart that had gone back home With a blessing and last farewell. But you can't keep a Sailor's soul from springing And cresting the wave on his way, Any more than the Lark will be stopped from singing Even in the dawn of the day When Battle lets loose the flood of its strife For a world to be drowned in its wave, And he, and his mate, and his young, out of life Will be ground, with their nest for a grave. Eleven days after we left the Cape, Mast-high our troubles ran. The Shadow that followed at last took shapeâ On that day we lost a man, And the fellows all said that in taking his trip To the bottom, he sent his foot through The thin frail side of the rotten old ship, For his messmates to follow him too! The next we sprang a leak; in the hold Were two feet of water already! A gale had arisen; the old Craft rolled As if with her drinking unsteady. Three days we pumped, and swore, and prayed, And it seemed but a waste of breath: Three days a lively game we played At hide-and-seek with Death! 'Twas âScottieâ who crawled by himself at night, Under the bunkers to keek; With his head down one big hole, and his light Through another, he found the leak. And we looked, and we saw a sight in the gloom Made us hold our breath for a space: Wide open below was the door of doom; Death close to us, face to face! The water sprang like a plug in the street, When the force is on at the main: With such a Geyser under our feet, No wonder we pumped in vain. And as she lurched the waters rolled With the sound of a sea inside; Death-rattles that made your blood run cold. And we found her iron hide As full of holes as the sponge you wring; Honey-comb'd through and through! You couldn't patch the infernal thing, For she wouldn't hold a screw: Her mast's whole weight on a rotten plate Of the bulging bottom! And we Were sixteen hundred miles from land, On a sail-less, island-less sea. I once knew a Chap in consumption, who Was spitting himself away Bodily as he walked, and drew His life out, day by day, With his hacking, horrible cough. So it seemed That our poor old Ship must be A-spitting herself away, as she steamed, Piecemeal, into the sea. The pumps turned her inside out, each pull: (Grave-diggers digging our grave!) Till choked by the bits of the rotten old hull They were cruelly trying to save. And the old Ship shook, with her driving force, As if body and soul must rive, And throbbed, like the heart of a runaway horse Ready to jump out alive. Each thunder-thud of the piston-lunge Made every rivet leap, And I thought on my soul we should momently plunge Right through her, all of a heap! I felt each blow, through her thinness, smite As the Condemned may hark To the Scaffold Hammers, through his last night, Working for death in the dark. There we were, as good as entombed! Our Captain gathered us then, And told us as how the ship was doomed, But, like true Englishmen, We should stick together and make the most Of the little chance we had. So he gave the word to run for the coast Of St. Paul, and work like mad! Our grand Old Man hadn't much to say, But he looked as firm as the land, And got pretty near men's hearts that day: Not a shake in his voice or his hand! Through the Shadow of Death, that was gathering grim, He saw his duty clear, And did it. That was enough for him; No time, no room for fear! Just the Sailor you'd like to be By your side on a sinking deck: Just the man who would wait to see The last soul safe from the wreck! We cheered him in front of the battle, again And again; three proud cheers gave him, And then went at it, to live like men Or die, as such, to save him! We floundered in shallow water at last; More dangerous than the deep! âAll hands on deck,â was the order passed; Each man stood ready to leapâ Where were we? oh, down in our grave; Nobody seemed to think That we like the rest had Spirits to save: And hadn't a drop to drink! Stokers were forced to remain below And keep on a strong head of steam: I felt, each moment, the pipe must go. Not one of us dared to dream Of escape; my hair was on end, I know, As the war-tug came to the worst. But I thought we were nearest to death, and so Perhaps might reach heaven first. Then as she neared the bar we all Shook hands and bade good-bye; Each man, turning his face to the wall, Drew himself up to dieâ When, face to face suddenly brightens! There's a babble of witless words! And a spirit lives in us that lightens Like air in the bones of birds! Beautiful! light as an eggshell, over The bar at a bound she springs, As though all heaven had stooped, and given Us a lift, and we went upon wings! Death was past, we had leisure at last, And a gasp of fresh breath to pray: And I can tell you we were in heavenâ Had reached it another way. We are safe. But, my God! if our England In a coming hour should be found Rust-eaten right to the heart of her, And have to be run a-ground, Wrecked at a shock, like our Hulk on the rock; Whipped from the wide proud round Of her own wave-world, with her Union Jack furled, Of all her glory discrowned! Saviours of England's money, Is it so you think to save? By stopping of holes with your Seamen's souls, And ships like that for a grave? To the other side o' the world you send Us: which, doesn't matter a rap. But we think it is cruel hard to end Like rats that are drowned in a trap. We never mind Death, for the land we love, In the good old-fashioned way, Should we mount to the glorified souls above Through the smoke of some desperate day That makes all safe for the Island-Home: Proudly the last of our breath We will send you, blood-bubbling up through the foam; Only let us deserve our death! Heart of Oak that our England Should never neglect or forgetâ Heart of Oak that our England Must swim by, or sink in yetâ Ocean-home of the old Sea-Raceâ Shall it become the prey O' the mean and base, and a breeding-place For the Creatures of Decay? If we cannot keep the Sea, you Lubbers! Your Cent. per Cent. must stop. If we do not keep the sea, you Lubbers! You cannot keep the Shop! Our Empire's built a-top of the wave, Not at the bottom, and we Think they are the only men to save By land, who will save us at Sea. THE CAPTAIN OF THE âNORTHFLEET.â So often is the proud deed done By men like this at Duty's call; So many are the honours won By them, we cannot wear them all! They make the heroic common-place, And dying thus the natural way; And yet, our world-wide English race Feels nobler, for that death, To-day! It stirs us with a sense of wings That strive to lift the earthiest soul; It brings the thoughts that fathom things To anchor fast where billows roll. Love was so new, and life so sweet, But at the call he left the wine, And sprang full-statured to his feet, Responsive to the touch divine. âNay, Dear, I cannot see you die. For me, I have my work to do Up here. Down to the boat. Good-bye, God bless you. I shall see it through.â We read, until the vision dims And drowns; but, ere the pang be past, A tide of triumph overbrims And breaks with light from heaven at last. Through all the blackness of that night A glory streams from out the gloom; His steadfast spirit lifts the light That shines till Night is overcome. The sea will do its worst, and life Be sobbed out in a bubbling breath; But firmly in the coward strife There stands a man who has conquered Death! A soul that masters wind and wave, And towers above a sinking deck; A bridge across the gaping grave; A rainbow rising o'er the wreck. Others he saved; he saved the name Unsullied that he gave his wife: And dying with so pure an aim, He had no need to save his life. Lord! how they shame the life we live, These Sailors of our sea-girt isle, Who cheerily take what Thou mayst give, And go down with a heavenward smile! The men who sow their lives to yield A glorious crop in lives to be: Who turn to England's Harvest-field The unfruitful furrows of the sea. With such a breed of men so brave, The Old Land has not had her day; But long, her strength, with crested wave, Shall ride the Seas, the proud old way. A BIRTHDAY ON BOARD. (To Captain McMickan, of the Umbria.) Your Birthday, Captain! And we come To greet you, Matron, Mother, and Maid: Service like yours, Men tell us, from The Ladies' lips is best repaid! We greet you for your Birthday's sake, But still more warmly for your own; No truer Sailor treads the deck. How many a Triumph, all unknown, You have won by night from Death the grim, Where Danger lurked like some Sea-Elf: We take the larger pride in him Who shows so little for himself. We give our lives into his hand, And trust him where we cannot aid: He guides us safe from land to land; He makes the fearful unafraid. When the Sea rises, ridge on ridge, Against us, like some serried foe, We think âthe Captain's on the bridge,â And we can safely rest below. Through all its Vast may Ocean roll, Its billows beat, its voices rave, 'Tis but the servant of the Soul That rules the Wind and rides the Wave. We lack the words to speak your worth, But when the Voyage of life is o'er, Safe Harbour to you! And a Berth A l, on an Eternal Shore. THE SEA KINGS. The Spaniard thought to wear our Crown, Three hundred years ago; And bow the head of England down To kiss the Pope's great toe! And next the Dutchman swept the Sea With Besom top-mast high. Gone is their Ocean sovereignty; To-day, how low they lie! And now the Frenchman's old wounds burn Like devils in their pain, And bode the weather of war will turn To a bath of bloody rain. Tingle and ring the ears of France With sound of battle-hymns; As on Ambition's dark, mad trance The bloody vision swims. Sons of the old Norse sailors brave, We fill their place to-day,â No wisp of foam upon the wave, To flash and pass away. Our perilous prize we guard and keep Till last relief God brings, Then lie in calm majestic sleep Along with the old Sea Kings. Well may your proud eyes sparkle, ye Rough Sea-Kings, young and old; The salt Sea-spirit laughs to see The Frenchman grown so bold. Sword-bayonets, Rifled Cannon, may The poor of heart alarm, But pluck at last will win the day With naked strength of arm. We are not beaten at a dash, Nor swiftly overthrown,â Let Ship with Ship together lash, We know who must go down. No man in Gallic land will live To see us dispossessed; When our sun sets at sea we give Its glory to the West. Those old unconquerable waves, They mock at Tyranny; And never can a land of Slaves Be Ruler of the Sea. But would you see their Empress, now Behold her! here she smiles, This Diadem on Ocean's brow; This Glory of the Isles. We have fed the Sea with English souls, And every mounded wave To Heaven bears witness, as it rolls Some English seaman's grave! Our Rivers carry heroic dust For burial in the sea, Which helps to keep our noble trust, And battles for the Free. Not always down the Primrose path Of dalliance can we tread, Oft-times the Chosen People hath To climb with foot-prints red: Our highest life with cross, and scorn, And tears, may yet be trod, And England wear a crown of thorn, Whose Roses bloom in blood. We have immortal quarrel with The men who war with Right; We will not own him kin or kith, Who fails us in this fight. No room for him on British ground, No bed in Ocean's breast, Who draws her purple curtains round Unfathomable rest. If those old Greeks for Beauty wrought Their ten-years' daring deed, Shall it be said that less we fought For Freedom in her need? No. Fight till all the Brave lie dead, And grass grows on the mart; But Freedom here shall rest her head Upon our England's heart. Like some old Eagle on her nest, Up in her pride of place, Our England sits with brooding breast, And looks with sharpened face! She feels the Shadow of a Hand, But ere it touch her brood, The Sea that narrows round our land Shall run a moat of blood. Wave out, Old Bird! or still brood on! They shall not bring you low; A thousand years have come and gone, A thousand more shall go! Our True Hearts still shall tread the deck, Our Ships sail every sea, And ride like those who rein the neck Of rearing Tyranny. We've mounted many a windy wave, We've weathered many storms; Unshaken still we hear them rave, Safe in the Eternal arms. For if the worst comesâevery manâ We perish in our place, And then our Conqueror, if he can, May lead the new Sea-Race! 1860. A DAUGHTER OF THE SEA-KINGS. Many a time, from out the North, The fire-eyed Raven flew, And England watched its sailing forth, With eyes of wistful blue; Many a time her True-hearts stood All ranked and ready for Grim welcome, should the Bird of Blood Swoop down on wings of war! To-day, another Norland Bird Comes floating o'er the foam; And England's heart of hearts is stirred To have the dear bird Home. She comes soft-eyed, with brooding breast, On swiftening wings of love; And Britain, to her bridal nest, Welcomes the Daneland Dove. She comes; across the waters spread the sails; She comes, to play her brave, uncommon part; The Princess who will wear the name of Wales; The Woman who shall win our England's heart. The Nation's life up-leaps to meet her; And England with one voice goes forth to greet Her! Our Lady cometh from the North, The tender and the true, Whose fire of darkest glow hath rarest worth; For love more inly nestles in the North, To give, like fire in frost, its fervours forth: Whose flowers can keep their dew; And a look in its Women's eyes is good As the first fresh breath of the salt Sea-flood, Or the bonniest blink of its blue: And from its dark Fiords, with sails unfurled, Came the fair-haired Norsemen, The men that moved the world. They were the pride and the darlings of Ocean, Rocked on her breast by a hundred storms; Tossed up with joyfullest Motherly motion; Caught to her heart againâclasped in her arms. No Slaves of the Earth but Sea-kings, the rough Rovers Took wings of the wind and flew over the foam. Yet, the old True-hearts, like faithfullest lovers, Came back with the fruitfuller feeling of Home. Kings were they of the royallest blood That was blue with the hue of the salt Sea-flood. Come! stir the Norse fire in us mightily! Come, conquering hearts as they the heaving sea. Come, wed the people with their Prince, and bless Them from your neighbouring heaven of nobleness. There's nothing like a Beauty of the Blood To set the fashion of a loftier good! There's nothing like a true and womanly Wife To help a man, and make melodious life. For, she can hold his heartstrings in her hand, And play the tune her pleasure may command, And cause his climbing soul to grow in stature, Trying to reach the heights of her diviner nature. Come in your beauty of promise; Come in your Maiden glee; Let your sunshine scatter from us The shadow of Misery. Hearts in the dark have been aching, But now the clouds are breaking. Come as come the swallows Over the brightening sea, And we know that Summer follows With the sunny days to be. Come and give us your glad good-morrow, The Joy-bells shall ring, And the merry birds sing; Dumbly drooping, the Bird of Sorrow Shall hide his old head under his wing. And now a shining Vision blooms; I see the rich Procession glide Serenely 'twixt the swaling plumes, All nodding in their pride: Walking with sweet precision, she Moves slowly onward, softly nigher The Altar; meek in purity, Yet filled with stately fire. The dawn upon her sweet young face The dewy spring-light in her eyes, And round about her form of grace The airs of paradise. But lo! a Shadow dims the scene! We lift our eyes and sadly see How lonely stands the wistful Queen; No leaning-place hath she, Who, in her darkness seeks to hide, While the wed pair move whitely on As swans go gliding side by side, And all their splendours sun. O Widow's gloom! O wedding joys! O white fringe to the Mourning-pall! With the dead Father's hovering voice In music over all! This world is but a newer paradise, To that glad spirit looking through the eyes Of Love, that sees all bright things dancing toward It, gaily coming of their own accord. For 'tis as though the lightsome heart should climb Up in the head, to look from heights sublime And sing, and swing as it would never dropâ The merry reveller in the tall tree-top! Where Life is with such lofty gladness crowned, And all the Pleasures dance in starry circle round. But may this love be true as Hers who sees Ye, like a smiling future at her knees: The Wife who held God's gifts the richest wealth; Our Queen of Home who sweetened England's health; The Widow in whose face we looked to see That great black cloud of our calamity On the side nearest heaven, and marked her rise In stature, calm to meet her sacrifice: As one with faith to feel Death's darkness brings Almighty Love on overshadowing wings. True love is no mere incense that will swim Up from the heart a lover's eyes to dim, But, such a light as gives the jewel-spark To meanest things it looks on in their dark,â A spring of heaven welling warm to bless And sanctify each grain of earthiness. True love will make true life, and glorify Ye very proudly in the nation's eye. Ah, Prince, a-many hopes up-fold the wing Within the Marriage-nest to which ye bring Your Bride, the life ye live there will be rolled Through endless echoes, mirrored manifold. We charge you, when you look on your young Wife, And watch the ascending brightness of new life In the sweet eyes that double the sweet soul, That ye forget not others' dearth and dole. Just now, the North wind wails As though the Cold were crying Over the hills and over the dales, And sinking hearts know well what ails The sound of the wintry sighing: It bears the moan of the dying; Dying down in the starving Shires, Without food, and without fires. The bitter nights are cruel cold, One cannot help but wake, and think Of the poor milch-lambs of the human fold That have no milk to drink. A Royal Worker to his grave went down A little year ago, without his crown. He dreamed the time would come when Rich and Poor Might shake hands, strove to open wide the door. He tried to till our waste-land,âsought to see It glad in good, the stern world Poverty. His was a heart that nobly beat to bless, And heaved with doubled-breasted bounteousness Like very woman's. But, 'tis ever so; He's gone where all our golden sunsets go; Gone from us! Yet his memory makes a light, Enriching life with tints of pictured bloom, Like firelight warm upon the walls of night, An inner glow against the outer gloom. Do thou but live, and work as Albert willed, And he shall smile in heaven to see his dream fulfilled. Heroic deeds of toil are to be done, And lofty palms of peace are to be won. Life may be followed by a fame that rings With nobler music than the Battle sings, When Death, astride the black Guns, laughs to see That flashing out of souls, and grins triumphantly. Bear high the banner of our England's fame, And let the evil-doers fear her name. We joy to serve her, least of all the race; Yours is the chance to fill a foremost place. Like some proud River, stretching forth before ye Through all the land, your widening way doth lie, Brimming and blessing as it rolls in glory, Broadening and brightening till it reach the sky. A splendid Vision! the green corn looks gay; The Bird of Happiness sings overhead: And may the Autumn uplands far away Rise with the Harvest ripe in Evening's red; Your crescent Honey-Moon laugh out above The gathered Sheaves it gilds, at full with love. PERSONAL. ROBERT BURNS. A CENTENARY SONG. A hundred years ago this morn He came to walk our human way; And we would change the Crown of Thorn For healing leaves To-day. A vain recall! The dead men do Not turn back when the Curtain's down, To smirk and bow their thanks to you For after-clap or crown! And we can only hang our wreath Upon the cold white Marble's brow! Though loud we speak, or low we breathe, We cannot change it now. He loved us all! He loved so much! His heart of love the world could hold; And now the whole wide world with such A love would him enfold. 'Tis long and late before it wakes So kindly, yet a true world still; It hath a heart so large, that takes A century to fill! But tell the wondrous Tale to-day, While songs are sung, and warm words said,â Tell how he wore the Hodden Gray, And won the Oaten bread. With wintry welcome at the door Did Nature greet him to his lot; Our royal Minstrel of the Poor, Cradled in his clay-Cot. There, in the bonny Bairntime dawn, He nestled at his Mother's knee, With such a face as might have drawn The Angels down to see That rosy Innocent at prayer, So pure and ready for the hand Of Her who is Guide and Guardian where Babes sleep in Silent Land. And there she found her darling Child, The robust Muse of sun-browned health, Who nursed him up into the wild Young heir of all her wealth: And there she rocked his Infant thought, Asleep with visions glorious That hallow now the Poor Man's Cot For evermore to us: Disguised Angelic Playmates were Those still ideal dreams of Youth, That drew it on to Greatness; there We find them shaped in truth! There, young Love slyly came, to bring Rare balms that will bewitch the blood, To dance while happy Spirits sing, With life in hey-day flood. And there he learned the touch that speeds Right to the natural heart of things; Struck rootage down to where Life feeds At the eternal Springs: Before the Lords of Earth he stood A Man by Nature born and bred, To show us on what simple food A Poet may be fed. No gifts of gold for him, no crown Of Fortune ready for his brow; But wrestling strength to earn his own; It shines in glory now! He rose up cheery as the Larkâ Our dawn-bird of the better day. Many weird voices of the dark In his music passed away! He caught them, Witch and Warlock, ere They vanished; all the revelry Of wizard wonder, we must wear The mask of Sleep to see! Droll Humours came for him to paint Their pictures; straight his merry eye Had taken them, so queer, so quaint, We laugh until we cry. Meek glimpses of peculiar grace, Where Beauty lieth, in undress, Asleep in secret hiding-place, Hushed in the wilderness: Spring-dawns that open heaven-doors; Wild winds that break in seas of sound; Sad Gloamings eerie on the moors; The murdered Martyr's mound; Wan, awful Shadows, trailing like The great skirts of the hurrying Storm; Bronzed-purple thunder-lights that strike The woodlands wet and warm; And glorious Sunsets, God's good-night, Is smiled through to our world, and felt; Make rich his soul by ear and sight,â Through all his being melt. He knew the Sorrows of poor folk, He felt for all their patient pain; And from his clouded soul he shook Lark-like the music-rain. For them his eyes would brim with balm, Dark eyes, and flashing as the levinâ Grew at a touch as sweet and calm As are the eyes in heaven. So rich in sadness is his breast That tenderness, heaven-mirroring, fills, As lies the soft blue lake at rest Among the rugged hills; And quick as Mother's milk will rise, At thrill of her babe's touch, and strong, It heaves his heart, and floods his eyes, And overflows his song. In Life's low ways, and starless night, The Poor so often have to creep Where Manhood may not walk full-height, And this made Robin weep. But none dare sneer, who see the tear In Robin Burns's honest eye, With all the weakness, it comes clear From where the Thunders lie. Such Ardours flash from out that dew, And quiver in its pearl of pain; The Spirit of Lightning thrilling through A drop of tempest-rain! Of all our Birds the Robin he Is darling of the gentle Poor; His nest is sacred, he goes free By window or by door: His lot is lowly, and his wings Are only of the homely brown, But in the dreary day he sings When gayer friends have flown, And hoarded up for us he brings, In that brave breast of bonny red, A gathered glory of the Springs And Summers long, long fled. Even so all Birds of Song above, To which the poor man smiling turns, The darling of his listening love Is gentle Robin Burns: His Summer soul our Winter warms, He makes a glory in our gloom; His nest is safe from all the storms, For ever in our Home. Come in, dear Bird, with all the glow Of life and love that brims thy breast; A warmth to melt the winter snow In Poortith's coldest nest. When Hesper through some shady nook Sparkles on Lovers face to face, Where drooped lids shade a burning look, With beauty's shyer graceâ And holy is the hour for love, And all so silent comes the Night, Lest even a breath of faÃ«rie move That poise so feather-lightâ Where two hearts weigh, to blight or bless, Till swarming like a summer hive, The inner world of happiness With music grows aliveâ There as Life aches so, heart in heart, And hand in hand so fondly yearns, Love shakes his wings, and soars and sings The song of Robin Burns. Auld Scotland's Music waited long, And wandered wailing through the land, Divinely yearning in her wrong, And sorrowfully grand; And many touched responsive chords, But could not tell what She would say; Till Robin wed her with his words, And they were One for aye. His Ministers of Music win Their way where night is all so mirk, You scarce can see the Devil in The darkness at his work, Or feel the face of friends from foes; But these Song-Spirits softly come, And lo! a light of heaven glows Within the poorest home. On either side the hearth they glide, And take the empty seat of Care, Immortal Presences that bide In blessed beauty there. They set us singing at our work, Or, where no fitting voice is found, Out-smiles the music that may lurk In thoughts too fine for sound. They weave some pictured tints that shine Luminous in life's cold gray woof; They make the vine of Patience twine About the barest roof. An American Poetess applied this image to my own poetry. I have taken the liberty of passing it on to him who has the far greater right to it. More sweet his Songs, to him who plods Shut up in smoky city prison, Than to the cagÃ¨d Lark cool sods Cut ere the sun be risen. The Soldier feels them as a spring Of healing 'mid the Indian sand; They gush within him, and they bring Him news of the Old Land! With them the Sailor warms his heart, By night upon the wintry sea; With them our Serfs ennobled start I' the knighthood of the Free! Ah, how some old sweet Cradle-song The Exile's wandering heart still brings Home! home again, with ties as strong As Love's own leading-strings. We hug the Homestead, and more near The fresh and fonder tendrils twine To make our clasp more close for fear Our dear ones we may tine. Think how those Heroes, true till death, In Lucknow listened through the strife, And held what seemed their latest breath They had to draw in life, To hear the old Scots' Music dear Ask, down the battle-pauses brief, As Havelock's men, with fire and cheer, Swept in to their reliefâ âShould auld acquaintance be forgot?â Through flaming hell we come! we come! To keep that pledge, not given for nought Around the hearth at home. âWe'll tak a cup o' kindnessâ yet, For Scotland dear, and Auld Lang Syne; Ay, though that cup be redly-wet With blood as well as wine. âAnd here's a hand, my trusty friend,â And then it seemed the dear Old Land Did burst their tomb, the death-shroud rend, With Robin Burns's hand. How dearly Robin loved the Land That gave such gallant Heroes birth; Its wee blue bit of heaven, and Its dear green nook of earth. Where he once looked with tender gaze, In all our way-side wanderings, Shy Beauty lifts her veil of haze, And smiles in common things. More precious is the purple heath, The bonny broom of beamless gold; And sweeter is the mellow breath Of Autumn on the wold! The Daisy opes its eye at dawn, And straight from Nature's heart so true, The tear of Burns peeps sparkling! an Immortal drop of dew! With eyes a thought more kindly, we Look on all dumb and helpless things; In his large love they stand, as He Had sheltered them with wings. Down by the singing burn we greet His voice of love and liberty; High on the bleak hill-side we meet His Spirit blithe and free! And on this land should Foe e'er tread, He will fight for it at our side, Flame on our Banners overhead, In songs of victory ride. A hundred years ago To-day, The great and glorious Stranger came; Men wondered as he went his way A wild and wandering flame. The fiercer fire of life, confined, With higher wave will heave and break, And higher should the mountain-mind Thrust up its starward peak: But often is the kindling clay With its red lavas rent and riven, And Earth holds up a wreck to pray The healing hand of Heaven. Around his soul more sternly warred The powers that smite for Wrong and Right; And thunder-scathed and battle-scarred, Death bore him from the fight. But now we recognize in him, One of the high and shining race; All gone the mortal mists that dim The fair immortal face. The splendour of a thousand Suns Is shining! and the tearful rain No more with passionate pathos runs; He counts his grief our gain. The sorrow and suffering, soil and shame All gone! all far away have passed; He sitteth in the heavens of fame, With quiet crowned at last. The prowling Ghoul hath left his grave, Hushed is the praying Pharisee; His frailties fade, his Virtues brave Live everlastingly. For us he wrought imperishably, The lowly-born, the peasant's Son; We weep exulting tears that he So proud a place hath won! And such a Crown to bind thy brow, Thy glorious Child hath gained for thee, Thou gray old nurse of Heroes! thou Proud Mother, Poverty! Look up! and let the big tears be Triumphant, touched with sparks of pride; Look up! in his great glory ye Are also glorified. Or weep the tear that Pity wrings To think his brightness he should dim; Then 'tis the drop of heart-ache brings Us nearer unto him: 'Tis here we touch his garment; here The poorest or the frailest earns The right to call him kinsman dear, Our Brother, Robin Burns. In fires of suffering far more fair We forge the precious bond of love. Ah, Robin, if God hear our prayer 'Tis all made well above, And you who comforted His Poor In this world, have eternal home With those He comforteth, His Poor! In all the world to come. Dear Highland Mary went before To plead for you in saintly sooth, Whom she remembered when you wore The purity of Youth. With those high Bards who live for aye, Your faults and failings all forgivenâ May there be festival to-day, And a great joy in Heaven! The truth afar off found at last; The triumph rung impetuously Through all that Crystal Palace vast Of white Eternity. Dear Robin, could you but return Once more, how changed it all would be; The heart of this wide world doth yearn To take you welcomingly: Warm eyes would shine at windows; quick Warm hands would greet you at the door, Where oft they let you pass heart-sick, So heedlessly of yore! And they would have you wear the Crown Who bade you bear the crushing cross; Their glorious gain was all unknown, Until they felt the loss: The cup you carried was so filled, The pressing crowd, so eager round, Dragged down your lifted arm, and spilled Such dear drops on the ground! How we would comfort your distress, Would see you smile as once you smiled, And hold your hands in silentness, Strong man and little child! Your poor heart heaving like the waves Of seas that moan for evermore, And try to creep into the caves Of Rest, but find no shoreâ Poor heart! come rest thee from the strife; Come, rest thee, rest thee in the calm, We'd cry: come bathe a weary life In Love's immortal balm! We cannot see your face, Robin! Your flashing lip, your fearless brow; We cannot hear your voice, Robin! But you are with us now: Although the mortal face is dark Behind the veil of spirit-wings, You draw us up as Heaven the Lark Whose music in him sings. With tender awe we feel you near, You make our lifted faces shine; You brim our cup with kindness here, For sake of Auld Lang Syne. We are one at heart as Britain's sons, Because you join our clasping hands, While one electric feeling runs Through all the English lands. And near or far where Britons band, To-day the leal and true heart turns More fondly to the fatherland For love of Robin Burns. HOOD, WHO SANG THE âSONG OF THE SHIRT.â 'Twas the old story!âever the blind world Knows not its Angels of Deliverance Till they stand glorified 'twixt earth and heaven. It stones the Martyr; then, with praying hands, Sees the God mount his chariot of fire, And calls sweet names, and worships what it spurned. It slays the Man to deify the Christ: And then how lovingly 'twill bind the brows Where late its thorn-crown laughed with cruel lipsâ Red, and rejoicing from the killing kiss! To those who walk beside them, great men seem Mere common earth; but distance makes them stars. As dying limbs do lengthen out in death, So grows the stature of their after-fame; And then we gather up their glorious words, And treasure up their names with loving care. So Hood, our Poet, lived his martyr-life: With a swift soul that travelled at such speed, And struck such flashes from its flinty road, That by its trail of radiance through the dark, We almost see th' unfeatured Future's face,â And went uncrowned to his untimely tomb. 'Tis true, the World did praise his glorious Witâ The merry Jester with his cap and bells! And sooth, his wit was like Ithuriel's spear: But 'twas mere lightning from the cloud of his life, Which held at heart most rich and blessed rain Of tears melodious, that are worlds of love; And Rainbows, that would bridge from earth to heaven; And Light, that should have shone like Joshua's sun Above our long death-grapple with the Wrong; And thunder-voices, with their Words of fire, To melt the Slave's chain, and the Tyrant's crown. His wit?âa kind smile just to hearten us!â Rich foam-wreaths on the waves of lavish life, That flashed o'er precious pearls and golden sands. But, there was that beneath surpassing wit! The starry soul, that shines when all is dark!â Endurance, that can suffer and grow strongâ Walk through the world with bleeding feet, and smile!â Love's inner light, that kindle's Life's rare colours, Bright wine of Beauty for the longing soul; And thoughts that swathe Humanity with such glory As limns the outline of the coming God. In him were gleams of such heroic splendour As light this cold, dark world up like a star Arrayed in glory for the eyes of heaven: And a great heart that beat according music With theirs of old,âGod-likest kings of men! A conquering heart! which Circumstance, that frights The Many down from Love's transfiguring height, Aye mettled into martial attitude. He might have clutched the palm of Victory In the world's wrestling-ring of noble deeds; But he went down a precious Argosy At sea, just glimmering into sight of shore, With its rare freightage from diviner climes. While friends were crowding at the Harbour mouth To meet and welcome the brave Sailor back, He saw, and sank in sight of them and home! The world may never know the wealth it lost, When Hood went darkling to his tearful tomb, So mighty in his undeveloped force! With all his crowding unaccomplished hopesâ Th' unuttered wealth and glory of his soulâ And all the music ringing round his life, And poems stirring in his dying brain. But blessings on him for the songs he sangâ Which yearned about the world till then for birth! How like a bonny bird of God he came, And poured his heart in music for the Poor; Who sit in gloom while sunshine floods the land, And grope through darkness, for the hand of Help. And trampled Manhood heard, and claimed its crown; And trampled Womanhood sprang up ennobled! The human soul looked radiantly through rags! And there was melting of cold hearts, as when The ripening sunlight fingers frozen flowers. O! blessings on him for the songs he sang! When all the stars of happy thought had set In many a mind, his spirit walked the gloom Clothed on with beauty, as the regal Moon Walks her night-kingdom, turning clouds to light. Our Champion! with his heart too big to beat In bonds,âour Poet in his pride of power! Aye, we'll remember him who fought our fight, And chose the Martyr's robe of flame, and spurned The gold and purple of the glistering slave. His Mausoleum is the People's heart, There he lies crowned and glorified,âin state, Smiling, with singing robe wrapped richly round. But 'tis not meet, my England, his dear dust Should lie where splendid flatteries flaunt on tombs, With not a line of lettered love to tell What mighty heart lies quenched and broken there. So let us build our Poet's monument! With passionate hearts of love for corner-stones, And tears that temper for immortal fame. And it were well, my England, shouldst thou come To weep some honest drops above his grave. Our Hood is worthy of eternal praise And blessings, and dear heart-amenities, As warrior Wellington, who rode to fame On Death's white horse, by Battle's crimson path. 1850. MAURICE AND THE BIGOTS. The Savage broke the glass that brought The heavens nearer, saith the legend! Even so the Bigots welcome aught That makes our vision starrier-regioned! All Saviour-souls have sacrificed, With nought but noble faith for guerdon; And ere the world has crowned the Christ, The man to death has borne the burden! They laid their Corner-stones in dark Deep waters, who up-built in beauty Their ever-standing Triumph-Arc That crowns with glory lives of duty. And meekly still the Martyrs go To keep with Pain their solemn bridal! And still they walk the fire who bow Not down to worship Custom's idol. Our heart-strings sweetest music make When swept by Suffering's feeling fingers; And through soul-shadows starriest break The glories on God's brave light-bringers. God bless you, Maurice, in our dearth Your life shall leave a trail of glory; And gathering round the poor man's hearth We proudly tell your suffering's story! Take heart! though sown in tears and blood, No seed that's quick with love hath perished; Though dropped in barren by-waysâGod Some glorious flower of life hath cherished. Take heart; the rude dust dark To-day Soars a new-lighted sphere To-morrow! And wings of splendour burst the clay That folds us in Death's fruitful furrow. 1850. HUGH MILLER'S GRAVE. Before the Grave-gulf closes, let me drop My few poor flowers upon his Coffin lid! I loved the man: his taking roughness too I liked; it was the Sword-hilt rough with gems. I loved him living, not with that late love Which asks for rootage in the dead man's grave, And must be writ in Marble to endure. To many he was stern, for he could guard His tongue with his good teeth: to some he seemed Sharp as the Holly's lower range of leaves, His prickly humour all alive with spears: But if you climbed to the serener height, You found a life in smooth and shining leaf, Crowned with its calm, and lying nearer heaven. Low lies the grandest head in all Scotland. We'll miss him when there's noble work to do! We'll miss him coming through the crowded street, Like plaided Shepherd from the Ross-shire Hills, Stalwart and iron-gray and weather-worn; His tall head holding up a lonely lamp Of steadfast thought still-burning in his eyes, Like some masthead-light lonely through the night; His eyes, that rather dreamed than saw, deep-set In the brow's shadow, looking forward, fixed, On something we divined not, solemn, strange! He was a Hero true as ever stepped In the Forlorn Hope of a warring world: And from opposing circumstance his palm Drew loftier stature, and a lustier strength. From the far dreamland height of youthful years He flung his gage out 'mid the trampling strife, And fought his way to it with spirit that cut Like a scythed Chariot, and took up his own. Once more Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came, Saw bright forms beckon on the battlements, And stormed through fighting foes, true steel to steel; Slow step by step he won his winding way, And reached the top, and stood up Victor there; And yet with most brave meekness it was done. His life-tree fair of leaf, and rich in fruit! We could not see it mouldering at the heart. We knew not how in nights of pain he groped, And groped with bleeding feeling down dark Crypts Of consciousness, to find the buried sense; When the faint flame of being flickering low, Made fearful shadows spectral on the walls; And beckoning terrors muttered in the dark; Old misery-mongers moaned along the wind; The lights burned blue as Death were breathing near, And dead hands seemed to reach and drag him down To those who have been deceived by false belief. The powers of Evil often have a hand With human Lots in the dim urn of Fate. The awful Dark flung over him a pall Of pain, hot hands of hell were on his eyes, And Devils drew him through the cold night-wind; But while they held the helpless body bound, The spirit broke away. That rent was death! The iron will wherewith he hewed his path From the stone-quarries to the heights of fame, Still strove for freedom when the leap was death. But, never doubt God's Children find their home By dark as well as day. The life he lived, And not the death he died, was first in judgment. It is the writing on the folded scroll Death sends, and not the seal, that God will judge. I like to think the Spirit of Cowper caught Hold of his poor weak wandering hands in help, As at the dark door he in blindness groped. How it would touch that tender soul to read The earthly memories written in his face! Such memories as ope the gates of heaven: And he who soothed him with last words on earth Might whisper his first welcome in the heavens, And lead him through cool valleys green where grow The Leaves of Healing by the River of Life, Where tears and travel-stains are wiped away, All troubled thoughts laid in ambrosial rest, And hearts have ceased to ache, And there is no more pain. Before His throne who sitteth in the Heavens, Perchance the pleading Poet prayed that he Might sit beside him at th' Eternal feast. The fancy flower-like from his Coffin grew Even while I looked. He lay as Death did seem Only a dream he might have dreamed before; All peaceful as the face of Sabbath morn: The meekened witness of another world. That stern, white stillness had a starry touch, As his last look had caught the first of heaven. The battle-armour of a soldier-soul Lay battered, but still bright from many blows, Upon the field, large, such as few could wear. The ghosts of last year's leaves, that last night rose And rustled in their spectral dance of death, Are laid and silent in a shroud of snow! The day is dark above the long, dark host: The sad hushed heavens seem choked, but cannot weep. Many pale faces, many tristful eyes, With dumb looks pleading for the kindly rain That comes not when the heart can only cry With unshed tears, close round his wintry grave: The lonely men whose lives are still a-light And shining when the manual Toilers sleep, To whom Night brings the larger thoughts like Stars. I marvel if among them there is one Who shudders when men speak of such a death As if they named Hisâwho had longed to pluck Death's cool hand down upon the burning brain, But chokes the secret in his heart as though He crushed a hissing serpent in his hand, Lest it scream out, and his white face be known! Ah! come away, for sorrow is a child That needs no nursing! And all seems so strange. One last look, and then home to feel and feel What we have lost. And when from the dark earth A spring-tide dawn of leaf-light glistens green, And Nature with her dewfall and her rain Gives to our grief the last calm tender touch, In those sweet days when hearts are tenderest For those who never come back with the flowers, Upon some balmy Eve so beautiful We should not wonder if an Angel stood Suddenly at our side; the silent march Of all the beauty culminating thus! Then let us come, dear friend, and spend an hour At the communion table of His tombâ And pluck the Heartsease growing from the grave While Nature kneeleth in all places lowly, And blessings rest upon a time so holy. TO A BEREAVED FRIEND. God comfort you, my Friend, God comfort you! How mighty, how immeasurable your loss I can but dimly know; yet I have learned That only the most precious pass so soon. I could but stand Without, and dared not thrust My hand betwixt the curtains of your grief. I could not reach you sitting in the dark Of that lone desert where the silence stuns, And sound of sobbing would be kind relief. But I would speak some word that with a touch May make your cup of sorrow overbrim In tears that suck the sting from out the soul. I too have felt the gloom that brings heaven near; The love whose kissings are all unreturned, And longed to lie down with the quiet dead And share their slow sweet rest. I too have known This strain and crack of heart-strings, this wild whirl And wallow of sense in which the soul seems drowned. You are the Husband of an Angel, I Have two sweet Babes in bliss. We are very poor On earth, my Friend, but very rich in Heaven. Two years ago you comforted my loss; One year ago I sang your wedding song, And now She is not! She who had only looked On life through coloured windows of her dreams. All in the softest, sweetest breath of life, The bud of her dear beauty seemed to have blown, Your one-year darling who but sprang, and died, And left the fragrance of her memory, A blessed memory; a most blessed hope! She had the shy grace of a Woodland flower; In her Love veiled his look with timid wings; And her eyes deepened with a sadness rich, As though the mountain-tops of heaven-touched thought Made mirrored shadows in their lakes of light. Only a brief while did she wear the mask Of flesh that kept the fond immortal face Without a stain of earth or soil of time; And now her Nun-like Spirit takes the Veil In Heaven's cloistral calm. Look up, my Friend, And bravely bear the mantle of her pain, Which fell from her for you to wear for her: Look up, my Friend, and may one little glimpse Of all her glory touch your tears with light! Only in heaven can the dark grow starry, Only from heaven comes the wished-for Dawn. She liveth in the sight of Him who sees You also; Ye are one still in God's eye, That from His Picture of the Universe Turns on us in whatever worlds we move. ALBERT THE GOOD. Some Two-and-Twenty golden years ago, A youthful Wooer to our England came; To-day, he has won her, lying pale and low. Albert the Good we write his noble name. The Power that sits enthroned by open graves Hath risen to rule the air. His death-bell tolls, And rolls upon us in dull heavy waves, Sepulchral shadows over living souls. On every burdened wind the sound is borne, Invisibly swift the Sparks Electric slide; Till, under Archways of full many a morn, The gloom of our great loss will visibly glide. The meanest doorway darkens at the cloud, The poorest poor have lost a personal friend; Down to one level are the loftiest bowed; In the large clasp of nature all hearts blend. The gush of gladness in our eyes is dimmed; Christmas hath lost its glow of merry heartshine; The Wassail-cup will pass as though 'twere brimmed With the red, solemn, Sacramental wine, And dark in his extinguished light we stand. In every face we read how much bereft! A kindlier pressure of the clasping hand Tells of our loss, and clings to what is left. For he was one of those we never know Till they have left us, nor how great the love We bore them; they are all too meek to show Their dearness, till they stand our praise above. How should we mirror truly when a breath Set all the surface in a blurring strife? We are calmer now!âtouched by the hand of Death! To hold the lustrous image of his life. We met him coldly, and on looking back See all our dimness by his kindling glow; The mist we breathed hath served to mark his track, And make a starrier halo for his brow. At last our clouds of earth are cleared away! Albert the Good goes patiently to God; Smiling back to us with his frank blue day, Leaving us shining footprints where he trod. Down goes the Scaffolding, the Work is crowned; Much that was hidden from us may be read, And for the first time we can look all round The Statue of his life now perfected. The Flower of Chivalry upon the height, As featly could he bend to lowliest place; With something in his presence of the light That shone in Philip Sidney's gracious face. His natural kingliness made Crowns look wan, Whom Fate had set amongst the Lords of Earth To show them how the majesty of Man May shine above the starriest badge of Birth. He held forever hallowed the dear breasts Where nestling Love and its sweet babes had lain; Forever sacred kept Home's secret nest Of purest pleasure and of proudest pain. A calm, high life, crowned with a quiet death! His robe of pain around him folding, he Was not the man to waste his dying breath; Who truly lives, can die with dignity. The gentle spirit did not wish to hear The women moaning through the house for him, But only sought to feel its darlings near Enough to bless them when 'twas getting dim! No need of Courtly lies for comforting; For he can face the truth, though stern and wild: Through spiritual rehearsal he can wring The victory! and his soul within him smiled. It is not near so hard for one to bow And enter the dark doorway of the Tomb, Who has learnt to meet Death kneeling with bent brow; Whose inward light can pierce that outer gloom. And while in sorrow here we dimly sit, We lift the head, to ease an aching breast, And, looking up, behold the Stars are lit; And there's another in the realms of Rest. Rest, happy soul, in thy salvation deep; The top of life, and endless day for thee; While in the valleys here we strive or sleep Among the shadows of Eternity. We can but kneel, and grope, and kiss His feet Who takes thee to His infinite embrace; We feel transfigured if our touch may meet His garment's hem; but Thou beholdst His face. Poor Widowed Queen! we see her as she trod The Aisle where Music's mellow thunders rolled, And Heaven opened, and the smile of God In sunbeams crowned her head with saintly gold. And how we listenedâknowing she was blestâ To the proud murmurs of the brooding dove; Home-pleasures round the royal Mother pressed, And God gave many voices to her love. And now the cloud of this calamity Darkens the crown we set on her young brow: Ah, look up to the side next Heaven, and see 'Tis God Himself that crowns our lady now! With all hearts aching for the folded face, We can but grasp His hand in prayer for her! So lonely in her desolate, high place; And leave her with the Eternal Comforter. Though two be parted in that shadow drear, Where one must walk alone, yet is it given For the Beloved spirit to be near; The human vision with the voice in Heaven. It is my faith they friend us in our need; With tender cords they draw us where they move; And often at the noon of night they feed With dews of Heaven the lilies of their love. Warm whispers will come stealing like a glow Of God, to kiss the spirit's sealÃ¨d eyes Till they be opened, and True Love doth know Its Marriage Garden blooms in Paradise. Here hearts may beat so close that two lives make Only one shadow in the sun we see, But, in the light we see not, these shall wake One Angelâwedded for eternity. This mourning shall be made majestic mirth; This grief shall be a glory otherwhere; The music that we hear no more on earth Will help to make up Heaven when we are there. The sap is swart and bitter in the bark, That sweetens sunnily in the fruit above, And spirits yearning upward through the dark Shall climb and summer in the light of love. And Thou, young Prince, whose Pilot saw thee tide Safe o'er the reefs beyond the Harbour-bar, Then left theeâBeaconing o'er the waters wide, This Star of Morn shall rise, thine Evening Star. May thy life flourish, ripen hour by hour, And heavenward draw the virtues of thy root; Our eyes have seen the beauty of the flower, Do thou unfold the glory of the fruit. We build his Monument, but men may see His steady lustre live in thee and thine; And thou mayest bear, to Empires yet to be, The goodness and the glory of thy line. Think of the dear face dark beneath the mould, And be thou to us what he would have been; So shall the secret springs of sorrow old Give to thy future paths a gladder green. This is a waiting hour of wonder for The world; our England looks across her waves; Will the Dove seek her bosom, or red War, Whose footprints tread deep pits for gory graves? Is it the kiss of Peace and Righteousness, That softly thrills the hushed, grim silence through, Or Battle's bugle-cry that makes us press All sailâsend up our brave old bit of blue? We know not. But, if foot to foot we stand, On slippery boarding-plank, or ruddied sward, 'Twill be the sturdier stroke for our dear Land That holds another grave like this to guard. And all is well that makes a People one, Even though the meeting-place be Albert's tomb: We gather grapes of joy up in the sun, But our best wine must ripen in the gloom. Many true hearts have mouldered down to enrich The roots of England's greatness underground; Until, below, as wide and strong they stretch, As overhead the branches reach around. And so our England's glory ever grows, And so her stature rises ever higher, Until the faces of her farthest foes Darken with envy, overshadowed by her. So climb the heavens, Old Tree, until the gold Stars glisten as thy fruitageâheave thy breast And broaden till the fiercest storms shall fold Their wings within thy shelter and find rest. WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. The Merry Bells ring in the Christmas Day, While in our hearts a mournful knell is knolled, As other tidings through the land are rolledâ Telling of a great spirit passed away. Another heart of English Oak gone down, Like some three-decker striking with no word Of warning; sails all set; all hands aboard; When sunniest skies were smiling with their crown. Low lies the stately form that towered so tall, With life so lusty, and with look so brave; The head thrown back, as if to breast the wave For many a yearâthe wave that whelmeth all. For all the sobs that rise, or tears that rain, No more fond, fatherly words for Lad and Lass! No more across his manly face will pass The light of passion, or the shadow of pain. We never told our love! He would have thought We prattled prettily, amused the while; And held us at a distance with his smile, Until we hid the presents we had brought. Now we might stroke the almost young, white hair, And even kiss the cold and quiet brow; The heart may have its way, and speak out now: He will not mock us, lying silent there! A natureânot at first sight meant to winâ That prickly for protection grows without, To safely fence its tenderness about, And fold the sweet virginities within: Just as you find a nest whose outer form Looks grimly rugged when the boughs are bare; The birds have flownâyou peep inside, and there How softly it was lined! how brooding-warm! He had our English way of making fun Of those shy feelings which our hearts will hold Like dew-drops all a-tremble, and enfold Them with our sheltering strength from storm and sun. We listened to his voice, as some true Wife, Upon her Husband's breast may lean her head, While many things in her dispraise are said By Him; but she leans closer, life to life, For, while the covert words sound on above, Their other, deeper meaning she divines; She hears his heart; knows its masonic signs; And nestles in a bosom large with love. So loud he cried, a Snake in Beauty's bower; A Worm that gnaws at life's most human root; A Wasp that revels in our rarest fruit; So gently breathed the fragrance of the flower! He kept his Show-Boxâscant of Mirrors where You saw Eternity whose worlds we pass Darkly by daylight, but, with many a glass, Reflecting all the Humours of the Fair! The thousand shapes of vanity and sin; Toy-stalls of Satan; the mad masquerade: The floating Pleasures that before them played: The foolish faces following, all agrin. He slyly pricked the bubbles that we blew; He cheered us on to chase our thistle-down; Crowning the winner with a Fool's-cap Crown; And Bon-Bons mottoed in quaint mockery threw. Then in the merry midst some sad, strange words Would touch the spring of tears. His eyes were dry, And, as your laughters ceased, were wondering why? Laugh on! He had only struck the minor chords! He was not one of those who are light at heart Because 'tis empty in its airy swing: He found the world too full of sorrowing, But showed us how to smile and bear our smart. Many of God's most precious gifts are sad To tears, and, though no weeper, this he knew. So, in our merry wine, would steep the rue, That with a manlier strength we might grow glad. And, year by year, still kindlier to the last, He drew us towards him; showing more and more, The heart of honey, human to the core, That into Love's full flower ripened fast: Thus Music sweetens to the latest breath, And closer draws the leaning, listening ear; And still it whispers, from its heaven near, Of some more perfect sweetness beyond death. Large-hearted, brave, sincere, compassionate! We could not guess one half the Angels see: They found you out, Old Friend, ere we did! We But reach the nobler justice all too late. Soft, O Beloved! be your early Rest, And sweet its quiet when the grassy green Shuts out so many and many a sorry scene: Heaven sun the hoarded fragrance from your breast! And may the Spirit that with us but gropes And stirs our earth, and yearns up through our night In strivings dumb, with you have found the Light That giveth eyes to poor, blind human hopes. For usâI know you would have us put away The tears; draw closer, man the gap, and keep Old kindly customs; sing the sorrow asleep, And all make merry, this being Christmas Day. ACROSS THE WATER. My Friend, I met you when the Shadow lay Darkly betwixt you and the outer day; Your life, frost-bitten to the core, was dumb With Winter, as if Spring would never come. The smile that sprang up in your eyes to give A Stranger greeting had no heart to live For you, when it had cheered me on my way. I saw you like some War-horse who had smelt Burnt powder, and the joy of onset felt, Now doomed to plough the furrow, who should chance To catch the music, see the Colours dance, And hear his fellows neighing for the war, And he, too, snuffs the fighting from afarâ Down comes the lash, in mist the visions melt. I knew not how your life was crossed and crossed, As is a letter, till the sense looks lost; Nor what you held at heart, and still must hold, That makes the whole wide warmest world a-cold. But now the heavens brighten overhead, And though the ways are miry you must tread, I greet you on the break-up of the Frost! Up and fight on, my friend, with spirit stripped As is the hardened War-lance, grimly gripped, That late was green and leafy in the wood, Now bared for battle and the reek of blood. There is a darkness we can only dash Out of the eyes with the soul's fighting-flashâ No help in giving up through feeling hipped! In such a world as this it ne'er avails To sit and eat the heart, or gnaw the nails; The live souls have to swim against the tide, The deadest fish can float with it and ride. Heroic breath must lift and clear the skies That we have clouded with our own vain sighs; Heroic breath must fill your future sails. It is the well-borne burden that will tone Our manhood; turn the gristle into bone. The storms that on the hill-side bow the trees Help bring the power to bear, and knot their knees, And (I have seen them kneeling) thus prepare Them to receive the onsets they must bear; So 'neath its load the might of manhood's grown. Nor murmur of a life by Falsehood marred, Or Roof-tree by the fires of Ruin charred. Why, what hath Falsehood in the world to do But Lie to Live, and die to prove the True, And then be buried, while the new life waves Its greenness o'er the Carrion in such graves? But strike! strike on, strike often, and strike hard! Hope, work, fight on, my Friend, and you shall stand One of the foremost of a noble band; Stand visibly in the smile of Heaven, and shed Light from within you, wheresoe'er you tread; Stand on the higher summit to transmit A new live heart-beat from the Infinite, To kindle, as it throbs throughout the land. The world is waking from its phantom dreams, To make out that which is from that which seems; And in the light of day shall blush to find What Wraiths of darkness had the power to blind Its vision; what thin walls of misty gray, As if of granite, stopped its onward way: Up, and be busy as the early beams! THE ENGLISH OF IT. It was a gallant stand, Tom; Give us your hardy hand, Tom, For love of the Old Land, Tom, We grasp it with good-will. Although you heroes of the Fist May think more of the golden grist You bring to such a mill. 'Twas brave to see you dash on, Tom, And with your one arm lash on, Tom, In that true English fashion, Tom, Which never will wear out: The only fashion that would do, At Inkerman and Waterloo, And many a bloody bout. Through all that punching time, Tom, The big heart rode sublime, Tom, As we have seen it climb, Tom, On other famous fields: The temper beaten out with blows, That when to give in never knows, And so it never yields. Valour shall have its crown, Tom, In your plain way you have shown, Tom, That we can hold our own, Tom, Against all comers still; With not one feather of white in us; But game, with lots of fight in us; A heart and a half up-hill. The Belt with which we are bound, Tom, Is yon blue Ocean round, Tom; If any foe be found, Tom, Who thinks to take it, then He must fight for it till all's dark, And one shall go down, red and stark, Never to rise again. We won our English Land, Tom, And keep it hand to hand, Tom, Like you at need we stand, Tom, Touch it whoever dares. If left to battle single-hand, We fight for this dear England, As once you fought, Tom Sayers! PRIDEAUX AT MAGDALA. No Cross of Valour hath the Muse to give His faithful breast, but she may bid him live In hearts of grateful glow, Who went to bear his Message with last breath, Nor changÃ¨d countenance at sight of Death, When Napier bade him go. England, our Helen, watching from the wall To cheer us fighting, mourn us if we fall, O'erlooks her gallant Son! She hath so many lofty memories To keep her lifted gaze; a deed like this So many would doâhave done: He did it! Moyse, a Private in the âBuffs!â Though only one of our neglected âroughs,ââ All English, life and limb: He would not bow his head except to die; He could not let our England's likeness lie Dishonoured, shamed in him! Duty, not Glory, is our proud Pass-word, Who ask that we may prove for England's sword True steel at needâno more. Yet worthy of his guerdon is Prideaux, As if on board they had borne him, lying low For us who were safe on shore. That large content with death for England's sake In narrower hearts a nobler life shall wake, To breathe with ampler breath, And some poor soul, caught in as bitter strait, Shall think of him, and sternly face its fateâ Go on, and out-face Death! Blow, winds of God! and stir us to the root, Shake down all wormy and unworthy fruit, There's new life in your breeze! Traitors may talk of England going down (In quicksands they, their coward selves, have sown)â She swims in hearts like these! CAMOENS. âEnglished by Richard Burton.â And well done, As it was well worth doing! for this is one Of those old Poets, who are always new, That share eternity with all that's true, And of their own abounding spirits do give Substance to Earth's dead Shadows; and make men live Who in action merely did but flit and pass,â Now fixed for ever by Thought's reflecting-glass. This is the Poet of weary Wanderers In perilous lands; and wide-sea Voyagers, And climbers fallen and broken on the stairs: A man of men; a master of affairs, Whose own life-story is, in touching ruth, Poem more potent than all feignÃ¨d truth. His Epic trails a glory in the wake Of Gama, Raleigh, Frobisher, and Drake. The poem of Discovery! sacred to Discoverers, and their deeds of derring-do, Is fitly rendered, in the Traveller's land, By one o' the foremost of that fearless band. PUNCH IN A GRAVE MOOD. Farewell. No matter who may fall, Our flag must wave out on the wall; The Workers brush their tears away, My Merry-makers still be gay! But there's a crack in my old voice; An ache at heart; I miss you, Boys,â Good fellows and dear Comrades gone, And ever going one by one! We know how some have had to quaff The bitter cup, and make men laugh; Of scenes behind the Scenes we know That would have spoiled the outer show. And how you kept the worst behind, And gave your best and never whined,â Good fellows and dear Comrades gone, And ever going one by one! Mirth mixed with sadness everywhere! Have you the Charivari there? Has Elia joined you, and MoliÃ¨re, Burns, Rabelais, Heine, and Voltaire? My Merry men with the Mermaids rare, And Shakespeare chosen for the chair? Good fellows and dear Comrades gone, And ever going one by one! I think the smile of kindly mirth That you so often made on earth To lighten in the saddest face, And brighten in the darkest place, Will be reflected from below To shine on as your Afterglow! Good fellows and dear Comrades gone, And ever going one by one! A REVIEWER REVIEWED. I. The Nightingale and Cuckoo sang their best; A Jackass was the judge. Long-ear addressed Himself to listen,âsaid that Philomel, Though somewhat wildly, warbled pretty well; But, for a good plain songâin a single word, Like what himself might singâwhy, he preferred The Cuckoo!âSuch a common-sense-like bird! II. I sang my Song, which I had long rehearsed, And asked, with heaving breast and throat athirst, For drink from some good soul, that might be you, Not craving nectar, nor ambrosial dew, But quite content with Critical half-and-half. And then your lattice opened with a laugh, And I, expectant of some natural drops, Received, like Socrates, your shrewish slops. III. You are disappointed with my work? Ah, true, It was not meant, my Friend, to mirror you; The only thing on earth you care to view! IV. Am I, too, such a miserable Elf? Do let me look you in the face, my brother; 'Tis only in the Mirror of each other That we can see the littleness of self! V. Below the surface my soul drew the breath Whose bubbles only rose up for their death, And you must sound the depths ere you can mark The things that I have dived for in the dark. 'Tis hardly possible for pearls to swim Like the light bubbles breaking at the brim! VI. Poor little Inkfish! you may strain and squirt Your little life out in a little dirt. 'Twould take a many million such to be Seen as a little stain even in the sea! VII. O boy, the Apprentice-pen is sweet to touch As that first clasp-knife we so proudly clutch; Ere conscience wakes we live one glorious hour, And cut and slash with cruel sense of power. We wield the Scissors as 'twere Fate's own Shears: Sheer folly! as we learn in later years. VIII. Think of a Midge blaspheming at the beam That makes him visible; Suns him in its gleam, And gives him life for a moment to blaspheme! IX. You had no power to crown me with the bay: You could not reach to snatch one leaf away; But you may rob my little ones of bread, Helping to damn the Book you have not read. Be proud! that is no trivial thing to do! Be safe! there is no law for Thieves like you. X. The time will come when such as you and your Co-mates, that try to slam some outer door On me and mine, will turn and see and start To find us folded safe in England's heart! XI. I was surprised and chafed, but in no rage I pin my little Chafer to the page, My Specimen saved and mounted on the brink Of the vast black Oblivion of Ink! XII. You did your little best to prick and sting, And Briar-like about my feet you cling: Is it that when I lift the waving wing Toward heaven it may uplift the creeping thing Near the warm heart of God's own brooding blue? But heaven is only to be grown into By upward living! True, the very dust May climb the Sunbeamâride the wind; yet must Fall back to Earth again, as dust to dust: And where you are rooted you must rot! Adieu. I prick you out, I shake you off; I scorn To carry you with me, even a single thorn! The place for Briars now, as in the past, Is on the dead men's graves they clutch at last. AN OLD CUSTOM STILL EXTANT. A poet sought the golden prize For Wife and Child, till, out of breath, He gained itâwhen the Coins, in death, Were laid upon his sightless eyes! In winning bread for Child and Wife, His death was ten times worth his life. A FORERUNNER. âBefore his time by a Century? What an abortion he must be!â So, naturally misconceived, He lived unwelcomed, died ungrieved. After long years the world turned round To read his work who had gone uncrowned; Their loss they now commemorate, And doubly mourn their own sad fate! When present, men forgot to trace The message for them in his face; When passed, they turn, and, with their looks Adore the back side of his Books. THE FORERUNNER. âThe many care not?â Well, if true, To their indifference is due One half the dearness of the Few! My Friends that would have welcomed me Come afterward, by Two and Three; I can but meet them mentally. I shall not hear the mingled shout Of blame and praise, belief and doubt: I vanish ere they find me out! I saw the ambitious pass me by, To grasp their glory that seemed nigh, Nor felt their crave, nor swelled their Cry. Dear Followers! who will be Too Late To bid me Farewell in the Gate Of Life and Death where none may wait, Only a little I fore-run; I shall be with you still: We are one In that good work you must get done. ALEXANDER RUSSEL. What! âRussel of the Scotsmanâ dead? Nay, Death himself would hang the head, And dare not tell the foolish lie; Such living forces never die. The Shadows that make up our night Were growing thin for him to fight. But still he fights, we think with pride, Our battle from the other side! Hard head, warm heart, and liberal hand, Open or shut, to bless or brand; Large-moulded, with Norse fire aglow; This was a man, to friend or foe! Long in our mÃªlÃ©e will be missed The mace of Russel's mighty fist, That struck, and, wasting nought in sound, Buried its blow without rebound. With âderring-do,â and thought that strives, Erect his Statue in your lives, Warm-blooded, not in marble wanâ The living measure of the man! Walhalla! Rise and welcome him Aross the Braga-Beaker's rim; And, that his glory may be full, Brim high some Water-Drinker's Skull. A PERSONAL REPLY. No! No. My Lord Dark-Lanthorn's-field, You are not the kind of man to wield The weight of England's Sword and Shield. No! No. Too sacred is the Flag, For flaunting like a Bull-ring rag, Above your game of Bully-Brag. No! No. Far better it ceased to wave There, with the Dead, suspended, safe In dust enough to be its grave! No! No. You have led us to the ridge Of the Abysm, and like a Midge Would cross it. Nations need a bridge! No! No. Though painted for the path Of War, you had better take a bath: Let Harlequin now sheathe his Lath. No! No. Our England, made to don The mask of a face, with her true one Shall laugh you into Oblivion! No! No. We do not mean to fight For Murderer and Sodomite; Born enemies of all that's right. No! No. If you must end the play With some blood-letting Policy, pray You follow that of Castlereagh. AT THE PRISON-DOOR. Right to the other side o' the World a yell Rang round, so brutal, we could hardly tell Whether it rose from England or from Hell. âGreat God!â they cried, âwhat has this Blabber done? Blazoned the sin of Modern Babylon To all beneath the never-setting sun! âWhy, 'tis the Law of Let-Alone that we, Who are rich, should grind the poor, and trade be free; We pay, and pluck the fruits of Poverty. âHow shocking! he would strip us Shirt and Smock, And show us naked in the Public Dock!â 'Twas shocking to the Knaves who need the shock! The gorge of London rose; but not to thwart The monsters who had made us sick at heart,â Rose against Him who took the Children's part! Time-honoured Institutions were at stake; The Brothels so long Sacred to the Rake; The Vested Interests began to quake. The Cynics proffered him Don Quixote's crown, The Libertines their pity, Fools their frown; Press-gang and Judges kicked him when he was down! But 'twas the voice of Truth we know, they know, The Rowdy Rich who rushed to strike him low, Or shut his mouth with one back-handed blow; And Truth shall yet be free, nor vainly strive For utterance, bound and dumbly buried alive; Free from the gag, the manacle, and gyve. The Curs and Cowards of the Cockney Press May call it a great failure; nevertheless 'Tis the Foreshadow of as great Success! The Labourers wake at last from their long sleep; The Waters rise around us that shall sweep This foulness with their Deluge to the deep. Stead struck his blow and failed and fell, you say. Such was Their failure who have paved a way With their dead bodies for our feet to-day. Look you! this Man is of another mould Than you who sell your little souls for gold, Or, where you have none, are in body sold! And some are Chosen, born and bound, to be Torch-bearers; they who set the sufferers free Must show us sights men do not want to see. In devious ways Detectives have to work And tramp the mire and hide in midnight mirk, If they would catch the Lawless where they lurk! Though not in the Salvation Army's van, Nor of the Shut-eyed Faith, some of us can Respect a Worker, recognize a Man. Honour to him, we cry, who sought to save The Girls dragged down our gutters to the grave! For him our plaudits ring, our welcomes wave. And so we greet him at the Prison-porch, With hearts that beat the music of his march, And bosoms lifted for a Triumph-Arch. THE FALSIFYERS OF MYTHOLOGY. You ask to have the Children's souls, in pledge That these shall only bear your kind of fruit, Who are but dead sticks in the living hedge, Rotten from lack of root! Let England lift her hand to scratch her head Consideringly, Your hold's not worth a pin Who are dead scuf outside the skull, instead Of living brain within! DEDICATION TO THE âNATURAL GENESIS.â At times I had to tread Where not a Star was found To lead or light me, overhead; Nor footprint on the ground. I toiled among the sands And stumbled with my feet; Or crawled and climbed with knees and hands Some future path to beat. I had to feel the flow Of waters whelming me: No foothold to be touched below, No shore around to see. Yet, in my darkest night, And farthest drift from land, There dawned within the guiding light; I felt the unseen hand. Year after year went by, And watchers wondered when The diver, to their welcoming cry Of joy, would rise again. And still rolled on Time's wave That whitened as it passed: The ground is getting toward the grave That I have reached at last. Child after child would sayâ âAh, when his work is done, Father will come with us and playââ 'Tis done. But Play-time's gone. A willing slave for years, I strove to set men free; Mine were the Labours, Hopes, and Fears, Be theirs the Victory. GARIBALDI. GARIBALDI IN EXILE. How dimmed is all thy glory, and how dark the shadow falls; How wildly wails the Sorrow through thy Hamlets and thy Halls! Our Banner on the Seven Hills no longer beckons me; The Dead alone are blessÃ¨d who thy suffering may not see. How are thy brave ones scattered on many an Alien strand, Thy Children leal and true to the Roman Motherland. The Birds that follow Summer, they come and they depart For the Land of my love, and the Home of my heart: And, like a wounded Bird, my spirit trembles in the wind, And flutters down: and they are gone, and I am left behind. O my Dovelets in the nest! O the Spoiler's bloody hand! And I so far away from the Roman Motherland. They have bound thee in the Grave-clothes; but we watch with tears and sighs, Till Freedom comes like Christ, and thou like Lazarus shalt rise. Thy pale, pale face, my Country, yet shall flush with ripening bloom, As Nature's colour kindles when the breath of Spring doth come. Ah! come, thou Spring of promise; mighty Hope, put forth thy hand, And build thy Arch of Triumph for the Roman Motherland. Sometimes when life is darkest, a glory bursts its glooms, As Lightning through the startled night, the face of things illumes; A sudden splendour smites me, and ere the thunders roll, I see thy face look radiant through the darkness of my soul! I see thee sitting at the feet of Freedom, great and grand, Thy children happy in thy smile, thou Roman Motherland. O thou among the Nations, for thy might, shalt yet be themed; Thy fatal curse of Beauty by Love's blessing all redeemed! The red wounds where they pierced thee, shall to scars of glory turn, And in thy tearful eyes the light of boundless life shall burn. The Heavens are filled with Martyrs, but our Earth still holds a band Who will meet in battle yet for the Roman Motherland. Many are the gallant hearts will never answer when Thy clarion-cry shall call us all into the field again! And many are the tears must fall, and prayers go up to God, But still the Vintage ripens, and the Wine-press shall be trod! The Harvest reddens rich for death, the Reapers clench the hand, And Victory comes to claim his Bride, our Roman Motherland. GARIBALDI ON THE MARCH. This is the Helper that Italy wanted To free her from Fetters and Grave-clothes quite: His is the great heart no dangers have daunted; His is the true hand to finish the fight. Way, for a man of the kingliest nature! Scope, for a soul of the high Roman stature! His great deeds have crowned him; His Heroes are round him; On, on, Garibaldi, for Freedom and Right. To brave battle-music up goes the smoke-curtain; A country arises all one to his call: The sound of his trumpet is never uncertain; He fights for his Cause till it conquer or fall. His Chariot-wheels do not spin without biting; And far better pointed for Freedom's red writingâ His Rifles and Gunsâ Than their Politics pens; Garibaldi, my Hero, best man of them all! When he sailed up our River, the frank, hearty Seaman, We saw how an English soul smiled from his face: For Italy's Saviour we knew it was The man, All hero, no matter what garb, or what placeâ And we prayed he might have one more grip that was glorious! Prophesied he should be Leader victorious Of Italy, free From the Alps to the sea; Now breathless we watch while he runs the great race. Fierce out of torment his fighters have risen, Shouting from hell, where they tortured them dumb; Maimed from old battle-fields, mad from the prison, Suddenly, strange as Cloud-armies, they come, With mouths that can shut like the Eagle's beak clasping, With hands that will grip like a bower-anchor grasping; The flying Foe feels, When they're close at his heels, That Death and the Devil are bringing his doom. Not only living! his dead men are fighting For him! thus with few he can scare the great host: For each one they see an Unseen Foe is smiting; Over each head an avenging white Ghost! All the young Martyrs they murdered by moonlight; All the dark deeds of blood done in the noonlight, Make their hearts reel With a shudder, and kneel To lay down their Arms and give all up for lost. They tell the wild tales of him, gathered together, Turn pale at his Shadow in midst of their speech; Down he swoops on them, like Hawk on the heather, Strikes home with sure aim, and upsoars beyond reach. Or, he sweeps all before him with whirling blade reeking. They fly helter-skelter, for shelter run shrieking, As waves wild and white, Driven mad with affright, Are dashed into foam as they hide up the beach. Watching o' nights in the cold, he remembers The Homes of his love in their ashes laid low; And hot in his heart Vengeance rakes up the embers, To warm her old hands at the wrathful red glow. He has had torn from him all that was nearest; He has seen murdered his Darlings the dearest; With all this and more, To the heart's crimson core He kindles! and all flashes out on the Foe. No peace, Garibaldi, till Italy, stronger, Shall sit with free nations, majestic, serene; And meet them as Lovers may meet when no longer The cold Corse of one that was dead lies between. For this, God was with you when perils were round you; For this, the fire smote you not, floods have not drowned you; Their Sword and their Shot Have hindered you not, And your Purpose crouched long for its pouncing unseen. On, with our British hearts all beating true to you; All keeping time to the march of the brave! I would to God we might cut our way through to you, Gallantly breasting the stormiest wave. Would the old Lion could leap in to greet you, Just as our free blood is leaping to meet you, Stand by your side, In his terrible pride, Mighty to shield, as You're daring to save. Long was the night of her kneeling; but surely Shall Italy rise to her Queenliest height. Many a time has the battle gone sorely, To make the last triumph more signal and bright. Her Foes shall be swept from her path like the stubble; Now is their day of down-treading and trouble; God tires of old Rome! Venetia cries âCome!â On, on, Garibaldi, for Freedom and Right! 1859. ONE OF GARIBALDI'S MEN. A crippled Child, a weak wan Boy, Sat by his Mother's side,â A widowed Mother's gentle joy, Her only wealth and pride: One of those Spirits, sweet and sad, That breathe with burdened breath; Are grave in life, but calmly glad Their faces smile in death. With a weird lustre in his look, Over his books he pored, Like one that, in a secret nook, Sharpens a patriot sword. The story of his Country's wrongs Made his heart melt in tears; The music of her olden songs Rang ever in his ears. Oft in his face, white as a corse, Brave Soldier-blood up-springs, Hot as the Warrior leaps to horse, When Battle's trumpet rings; With spirit afloat and sense aflame, Where Freedom's banners wave, To win a name of glorious fame, Or fill a Soldier's grave. The leal heart of a loving Maid Ran over towards him, Longing with kisses to be stayed There at the ruddy brim!â But hushed the yearning in her breast, Nor murmur made nor moan; She looked as though she had found the nest, And, lo! the Bird was flown. Suddenly, Freedom's thunder-horn The graveyard stillness broke;â It was the Resurrection-Morn, And Italy awoke! He felt her majesty and strength Up-lift his spirit too: To Manhood he had leaped at length, And almost stately grew. Then came, with all they had to give, Each fervid worshipper: And he, too, not worth much to live, At least could die for her! The Widow lent her only Child, And bade him help to win; While outwardly her proud face smiled, Sheâdropping tears within! The General looked on this young life Held out in hands so small! He could not, for the battle-strife, Take the poor Widow's all. âPoor Child!â he said, ârest you at home, For the good Mother's sake; We'll not forget you when we come.â It made his old heart ache. 'Twas at the close of a great day, The âRed-Shirtsâ raised their cheer, For Garibaldi came to say, âWell doneâ! One cried, âI'm here! And wounded in the Battle's brunt.â âWhat! hit behind, my Child? But brave men wear their wounds in front,â And playfully he smiled. Again, at the Volturno's fight, The Boy led on his band; Uplifted there on Capua's height, He saw the Promised Land, As Pilgrims watch their Mecca rise Over the desert's rim; He sawâpossessed it with his eyes! Enough, enough for him. Proud of his Boys, the General rode Past faces all aflame, And praised them; and their spirits glowed As if from heaven he came. Then something caught his eye; he reined His horse; stooped like a grand Old weather-beaten Angel, stained With battle-smoke, and tanned. With look more keen than cry or call, One staggered from the rest: âI'm hit once more, my General, Andââpointing to his breastâ âThis timeâsee! 'tis in the right place.â His smile was strangely sweet; He looked in Garibaldi's face, And fell dead at his feet! GARIBALDI AT ASPROMONTE. The Lion is down, and how the dogs will run! Something above the level is their delight To lift the leg at. How the birds of night Will hoot from out their dark, âHis day is done.â The worldly-wise will hasten to condemn The Man of Ages measured by the Hour; The Summit of his visionary power, A Pinnacle of Folly is to them. âWould he had kept his attitude sublime!â They cry. âWith crossed arms held his heart at rest, And left us his grand likeness at its best, Upon a hill up which the world might climb! âBetter for all had he been sooner shrined; The old true heart, and very foolish head. A model Man; especially if dead: Perfect as some Greek Statue, andâas blind.â Friends talk of failure: and I know how he Will slowly lift his surface-piercing eyes, And look them through with mournful, strange surprise, Until they shrink and feel 'tis Italy That fails instead. The words they came to speak Will shrink back awed by his majestic calm. His wounds are such as bleed immortal balm, And he is strong again; 'tis we are weak. It is not Failure to be thus struck down By Brothers who obeyed their Foe's command, And in the darkness lopped the saving hand Put forth to reach their Country her last crown! He only sought to see her safely home; The tragic trials end, the suffering cease In wedded oneness and completing peace; Then bow his old gray head and rest in Rome. It is not failure to be thus struck backâ Caught in a Country's arms, clasped to her heart; She tends his wounds awhile, and then will start Afresh. Some precious drops mark out her track. No failure! Though the rocks dash into foam This first strength of a nation's new life-stream, 'Twill riseâa Bow of Promiseâthat shall gleam In glory over all the waves to come. We miss a footstep thinking âHere's a stair,â In some uncertain way we darkly tread; But God's enduring skies are overhead, And Spirits step their surest oft in air. His ways are not as our ways; the new birth At cost of the old life is often given: To-day God crowns the Martyrs in His heaven; To-morrow whips their murderers on our earth. You take back Garibaldi to a prison? Well, that will prove the very road to Rome! They would have said âShe croucheth to her doom,â If Italy in some shape had not risen. We say it was God's voice that called him up The âBitter Mountain,â bound for sacrifice; So to that height his Land might lift her eyes, And bless him as he drank her bitterest cup. It is a faith too many still receiveâ Since that false prophecy of old went forthâ âThe tribe of Judas yet shall rule the earth;â But he is one that never would believe. His vision is most clear where ours is dim. The mystic spirit of eternity, That slumbers in us deep and dreamingly, Was ever quick and more awake in him: And, like a lamp across some pathless heath, A light shone through his eyes no night could quench; The winds might make it flicker, rains might drench, Nothing could dout it save the dark of death. And if His Work's unfinished in the flesh, Why, then his soul will join the noble Dead, And toil till all shall be accomplishÃ¨d, And Italy hath burst this Devil's mesh. Easier to conquer Kingdoms than to breed A man like Garibaldi, whose great name Hath fenced his Country with his glorious fame, Worth many armies in her battle-need. His is the royal heart that never quails, But always conquers; wounded, lying low, He never was so dear as he is now: They bind him, and more strongly he prevails. Greater to-day than Emperor or King, Although for Throne they seat him in the dust; The express Image of sublimest Trust, Crowned, consecrated by his suffering, With Sovereignty that overtops success! Nothing but Heaven might reach his patriot brow, And lo, the Crown of thorns is on it now, With higher guerdon than our world's caress. The Vision of all his glory fills our eyes, And with One heart expectant Nations throb Around him; with one mighty prayer they sob, And wait God's answer to this Sacrifice,â Praying for one more chance at turn of tide; One blow for Rome ere many setting suns; One stroke for Venice kneeling 'neath her guns; All Italy abreast, and at his side: That he may stand as Wellington once stood Victor upon the hard-won Pyrenees, With France below him, offering on her knees The White Flower Peace, sprung from her Root of Blood. FRANCE AND GARIBALDI. They tricked him when the Lion-heart broke loose; They mocked him as they caught him in the noose, Slew his young Heroes in the foulest strife: And then he went to offer France his life. She robbed him of his country, and he gave Himself; and only asked of her a grave! In natural greatness simple and sublime, He stands up peerless, towering o'er the time, With none beside him. So the Gallic Elf Explained him! 'Twas a man beside himself. GARIBALDI'S PROPHECY. That Pyramid of Imposture reared by Rome All of Cement for an Eternal Home And Shelter, that might shut out Heaven's Dome, Shall Crumble back to earth again: It must, For lack of blood to bind it! Every gust Shall revel in the Desert of its dust! No matter though it towers to the Sky And darkens Earth, you cannot make the Lie Immortal; though stupendously enshrined By Art in every perfect mould of Mind: Angelo, Rafaelle, Milton, Handel, all Its Pillars cannot stay it from the fall! And when that Prison of the Immortal, Mind, Hath fallen to set free the bound and blind, No more shall life be one long dread of death; Humanity shall breathe with fuller breath; Expand in Spirit and in Stature rise, To match its Birthplace of the Earth and Skies. WEDDED LOVE. THE YOUNG POET TO HIS WIFE. Like those Ambassadors of old, that went To some far Orient land, with precious gifts Of gems to nestle between Beauty's breasts, And crown her brows with a crest of winking flame, Or clothe her starrily as Queenly Night; And found that land a garden where they grew, Lavish, as all the dews were turned to gems; So bring I thee, Dear Lady of my love, My jewels, I have garnered up, to find How poor they are beside thy peerless wealth. My Muse! that moveth in a halo of light, Throned on the regnant heights of Womanhood; The heart of all thy beauty warm as when I looked out on the sunny side of Life, And saw thee summering like a blooming Vine, That reacheth globes of wine in at the lattice By the ripe armful, with ambrosial smile. The flying Cares but touch thy Life's fair face, Lightly as swimming shadows dusk the Lake. Come sit thee down, dear, by my side, To-night; The world shut out, our little world shut in, Where we are happy as the Bird whose nest Is heavened in the hush of purple Hills, Or regioned in the palmy top of life. Now shut thine eyes, and see a pageant bloom Upon the dark,âa Vision sweeping by. I was a dweller amid Shadows grim: Till Freedom touched my yearning eyes, and lo! Life in a shining circle, rounding rose, As heaven on heaven goes up the starry night. And Freedom was my glittering Bride. For me She walked the world as a Divinity, Sang like a Spirit in Life's darkened ways, I' the Rainbow reached forth girdling arms of love, To clasp the Unapparent to the Earth,â Turned common things to beauty: as the sun Kindles a glory in the grass and dust,â Went forth flame-plumed, in Chariot sublime, And rode the winds, as one who walks the worlds. And when the fresh Morn flowered like a Rose, Birds sang of her, and all their happy hearts Rang out in music, Leaves clapped faÃ«ry hands, The flowers for joy stood tearful in her glory, And World went singing unto World of Freedom. And I would blazon her heroic name, Sing such proud pÃ¦ans as touch the world to tears, Or chariot it to battle in her Cause: For O! her softest breath, that might not stir The summer gossamer tremulous on its throne, Makes the crowned Tyrants start with realmless looks! I would have given the lustre of my life To add one jewel to her diadem! And then You came, and Love grew lord of all. Look how the Sun puts out the eyes of fire! So when Love's royal glance my lattice lit, The fires of Freedom whitened on my hearth. The sleeping Beauty in my heart's charmed Palace Woke at Love's kiss. My life was set aflush, As Roses redden when the Spring moves by, And the green buds peer out like eyes, to see The delicate spirit whose sweet presence stirred them. How my heart ripened in its flooding spring; As when the sap runs up the tingling trees, Till all the sunny life laughs out in leaves, And lifts its fluttering wings! So my heart felt With such brave shoots of glory bursting up, As it had flowered for Immortality. The heights of Being came out from their cloud, As the cliffs kindle when the Morning comes Swimming the utmost Sea in ruddy haste, With foam of glory; till the flood of light, Like mellow wine, runs down remotest hills. You came, my sparkling Bird of Paradise! With a soft murmuring as of winnowing wings That fold the nest so dove-like tenderly! With brows that parted lovely waves of hair, And took the gazer's eye like some white Grace! Eyes large with love; lips eloquent of love; And cheeks fresh-misted with the bloom of Morn. And thou didst move, a Splendour 'mid Life's Shadows, Making a Rembrandt Picture. So the Stars In all their glory pass the shrinking Dark. O, I was stirred as though a Spirit went by; Or I had met some awful Loveliness, That haunts the realm of Dreams, or duskly floats Across the wondering solitudes of Thought. So Love grew lord of all. I touch my lyre, And Love o'erflows my heart, and floods my hand. Love makes all dear delights so soothly sweet, Life pants heart-stifled 'neath its luscious load, Like young Earth clasped in June's voluptuous arms, Faint with her fragrance, flooded in her flowers. Love is divine life, Beauty is its smile. O, Love will make the killing crown of thorn Burst into blossom on the Martyr's brow! Upon Love's bosom Earth floats like an Ark Through all the o'erwhelming Deluge of the night. Love rays us round as glory swathes a star, And, from the mystic touch of lips and palms, Streams rosy warmth enough to light a world: And Spirit-eyes, from out the purpling glooms, Mark how we feed this human Altar-flame; How speeds this ripening into Deity; What glittering robes for immortality Trail starry radiance through our dark of Earth! And in our home thy presence maketh Love A Mortal, who hath died to rise again, Immortal, in its nobler life with thee. O Love! make clear my vision, roll thou up My orb of Song from Passion's misting deeps To climb the heavens, and win the eternal calm; And though it shine not 'mid the Suns of Song, To set the World sweet-murmuring in its light, A Memnon, at the radiant touch of Dawn, I know each Star hath its own perfect place Above, though it may have no name on Earth. I hope my hope, I dream my dream, that life With me shall yet ring out melodious, 'twixt The silences of heaven and the grave. O Labour! blind and feeling for the day! Might I go forth to peer with eagle ken Into the blessed land of promise, where The Future like a fruitfuller Summer sits Ripening Her Eden silently, to bear The crowning flower of consummated Life,â Where Freedom's Song-Birds fly, to build their nests, And warm to life their brood of darling dreams: Then see thy dark look lighten at my news, Thy dim eyes dance divinely at the grapes; To loftier music time thy larger step; And hearten thee to lift up onward brows! I see a shape behind a mist, that burns In the flushed distance of some unseen Goal; It grows with gazing on, like Lovers' beauty. With beckoning smiles the Glory draws me near; One hand points up, one holds a leafy crown, For me to climb and wear with manlier growth: And airy Voices call me, bid me leap In Victory's Car as it goes bickering by. And Thou, dear Wife! with exultation lit, Wilt drop proud tears to enrich my wine of joy,â A costlier cup than ever Anthony's Queen Magnificent! drank in her voluptuous vein! LONG EXPECTED. O many and many a day before we met, I knew some Spirit walked the world alone, Awaiting the Beloved from afar; And I was the anointed chosen one Of all the world to crown her queenly brows With the imperial crown of human love, And light its glory in her happy look. I saw not with mine eyes so full of mist, But heard Faith's low sweet singing in the night, And groping through the darkness, touched God's hand. My heart might toil on blindly, but, like earth, It kept sure footing through the thickest gloom. I knew my sunshine somewhere warmed the world, Though I trode darkling in a perilous way; And I should reach it in His own good time Who sendeth sun, and dew, and love for all. Earth, with her many voices, talked of thee!â Low winds, and whispering leaves, and piping birds; The amorous sunlight, and the virgin dews; Eve's crimson air and light of twinkling gold; Spring's kindled greenery, and her breath of balm; The dance of happiness in summer woods, To silver dulcimer of sun-shot rain. Thine eyes oped with their rainy lights, and laughters, In April's tearful heaven of tender blue, With all the changeful beauty melting through them,â Dawn opened, Sunset ended, in thy face. And standing as in Love's own presence-chamber, When silence lay like sleep upon the world, And it seemed rich to die, alone with Night, The Stars have trembled through the holy hush, And smiled down tenderly, and read to me The love hid for me in a budding breast, Like fragrance folded in a young flower's heart. Strong as a sea-swell came the wave of wings, Strange trouble trembled through my inner depths, And answering wings have sprung within my soul: And from the dumb waste places of the dark, A voice has sighed, âShe comes!â and ebbed again; While all my life stood listening for thy coming: I guessed the presence that I might not see, And felt it in the beating of my heart. When all was dark within, sweet thoughts would come, As starry guests swim golden down the gloom, And through Night's lattice smile a rare delight: While, lifted for the dear and distant Dawn, The face of all things wore a happy look, Like those dream-smiles which are the speech of Sleep. Thus Love lived on, and strengthened with the days, Lit by its own true light within my heart, Like a live diamond burning in the dark. Then came there One, a mirage of the Dawn; She swam on towards me sumptuous in her triumph, Voluptuously upborne, like AphroditÃ© Upon a meadowy swell of emerald sea. A ripe, serene, smile-affluent graciousness Hung like a shifting radiance on her motion, As feathered flames upon the Dove's neck burn. Her lip might flush a wrinkled life in bloom! Her eyes had an omnipotence of power! âO eyes!â I said, âif such your glories be, Sure 'tis a warm heart feedeth ye with light!â The silver throbbing of her laughter pulsed The air with music rich and resonant,â As, from the deep heart of a summer night, Some bird with sudden sparklings of fine sound Strikes all the startled stillness into song. And from her sumptuous wealth of golden hair Down to the delicate, pearly finger-tip, Fresh beauty trembled from its thousand springs: And standing in the outer porch of life, All eager for the templed mysteries, With a full heart as rich in fragrant love As the musk-roses are of morning's wine, What marvel if I questioned not her brow, For the flame-signet of the Hand divine, Or gauged it for the crown of my large love? I plunged to clutch the pearl of her babbling beauty, Like some swift diver in a shallow stream, That smites his life out on its heart of stone. Ah! how my life did run with fire and tears! With what a passionate pulse my love did beat! But she, rose-warm without,âGod pity herâ Was cold at heart as snow in last year's nest, And struck like death into my burning brain. Just passing with her wanton robes afloat, She brushed and blurred the hues of my young life, As one may smear a picture while 'tis wet. My tears, that rained out love, she froze in falling, And wore them, jewel-like, to deck her triumph! But love is never lost, though hearts run waste; Its tides may gush 'mid swirling, swathing deserts, Where no green leaf drinks up the precious life: True love doth evermore enrich itself,â Its bitterest waters run some golden sands. No star goes down but climbs in other skies; The flower of Sunset folds its glory up, To burst again from out the bosom of Dawn; And love is never lost, though hearts run waste, And sorrow makes the chastened soul a seer; The deepest dark reveals the starriest hope, And Faith can trust her heaven behind the veil. WOOED AND WON. The plough of Time breaks up our Eden-land, And tramples down its flowery virgin prime. Yet through the dust of ages living shoots O' the old immortal seed start in the furrows: And, where Love looketh on with lustrous eye, These quickened germs of everlastingness Flower lusty, as in fabled Paradise! And blessings on the starry chance of love!â And blessings on the morn of merry May! That led my footsteps to your leafy bower. Thus hangs the picture in my mind, sweet wife! Clear as a Millais in its tint and tone. Nature drew near me with her glorious shows, And smiled to hear her young things all at play. The birds were singing on the blossoming sprays, With Love's sweet mystery stirring at their hearts, Like first spring-motions in the veins o' the flowers. A light of green laughed up the shining hills, That rounded through the mellowing, gloating air, As their big hearts heaved to some heart beyond, Or strove with inner yearnings for the crown Of purple rondure hung far-off in heaven! The Flowers were forth in all their conquering beauty And, winking in their Mother Earth's old face, Said all her children should have happy hearts. Deeper and deeper in the wood's green gloom I nestled for the fever at life's core: And thirstily my heart was drinking in Rich overflowings of some Cushat's love; When lo! the air instinct with glory grew, As if the world, while on her starry journey, Found sudden harbour in the clime of heaven. Upon a primrose bank you sat,âa sight To couch the old blind sorrow of my soul! A sweet, new blossom of Humanity, Fresh fallen from God's own home to flower on earth. A golden burst of sunbeams glinted through The verdurous roof's lush-leavy greenery, And on you dropped its crown of wavering light. Your eyesâhalf shut, while through their silken eaves Trembled the secret sweetness hid at heartâ Oped sudden at full, and wide with wonderment! The sweetest eyes that ever drank sun for soul: As subtly tender as a summer heaven, Brimmed with the beauty of a starry night! Your face, so dewy fresh and wondrous fair, Kindled as Love transfiguringly rose Like heavenward martyr through a birth of fire! The fleetest swallow-dip of a tender smile Ran round your mouth in thrillings; while your cheek Dimpled, as from the arch God's finger print; Out flew his signal, fluttering in a flush! And when your voice broke up the air for music, It smote upon my startled heart as smites The new-born babe's first cry a mother's ear, Yet strangely touched some mystic memory, And dimly seemed an old pre-natal sound. That day, with an immortalizing kiss, You crowned me monarch of your rich heart-world, Which heaved a boundless sea of love, whose tides Ran radiant pulsings through your rosy limbs. How the love-lights did float up in your eyes, Star after star from violet depths of night! Dear eyes! all craving with Love's ache and hunger! And all the spirit stood in your face athirst! And from the rose-cup of your murmuring mouth Sweetness o'erflowed, as from a fragrant fount. O kiss of life! that oped our Eden-world! The very earth heaved bosom-like, and heaven Clung round and clasped us as in glowing arms, To crush the wine of all your ripened beauty, Which were a fitting sacrament for deathâ Into a richer cup of life for me. THE BRIDAL. She comes! the blushing Bridal Dawn, With her Auroral splendours on, And green Earth never lovelier shone: She floateth on her azure way, In dainty dalliance with the May, Jubilant o'er the happy day! Earth weareth heaven for marriage-ring, And the best garland of glory, Spring From out old Winter's world could bring. All in white are the hawthorn boughs, The green blood reddens in the Rose, And every May-bud swells or glows. The Apple-tree on its green bough Hath caught a cloud of rosy snow; Up in the blue the Chestnuts blow. Cloud-shadow-ships swim faÃ«rily Over the greenery's sunny sea, That runs and ripples down the lea. The birds a-brooding, strive to sing, Feeling the life warm under the wing: Their love, too, blossoms with the Spring! The winds that make the flowers blow, Heavy with balm, breathe soft and low, All budding warmth, and amorous glow! Such a delicious feel doth flood The eyes, as laves the burning bud When cool rains feed ambrosial blood. Merrily Life doth revel and reign! Light in heart, and blithe in brain; Running like wine in every vein. Alive with eyes, the Village sees The Bridal dawning from the trees, And Housewives swarm i' the sun like Bees. All silent yet the Belfrey-Choir! Up in the twinkling air the spire Throbs, golden in the bickering fire. The winking windows burn and blush With colours rare as flow and flush Through summer sunsets bloomed and hush. But, enter: rarer splendours brim, Such mists of gold and purple swim, And the light falls so rich and dim. Even so doth Love Life's doors unbar, Where all the hidden glories are, That from the windows shine afar. Love's lovely to the passers-by, But they who love are regioned high On hills of Bliss, with heaven nigh. Dainty as Iris, when she swims With rainbow robe on lightsome limbs, The Bride's rare beauty overbrims! The gazers drink rich overflows, Her cheek a livelier damask glows, And on his arm she leans more close. A drunken joy reels in his blood, He wanders an enchanted wood; She ranges realms of perfect good. Dear God! that he alone hath grace To light such splendour in her face, And win the blessing of embrace! She wears her maiden modesty With tearful grace touched tenderly, Yet with a ripe Expectancy Her virgin veil reveals a form, Flowering from the bud so warm, It needs must break the Cestus-charm. Last night, with her white wedding arms, And thoughts that thronged with quaint alarms, She trembled o'er her mirrored charms, Like Eve first-glassing her new life; And the Maid startled at the Wife, Heart-painÃ¨d with herself at strife. The unknown sea moans on her shore Of life: she hears the breakers roar; But, trusting Him, she fears no more; For, o'er the deep seas there is calm, Full as the hush of all-heaven's psalm: The golden goal,âthe Victor's palm! And at her heart Love sits and sings, And broodeth warmth, begetting wings Shall lift her life to higher things. The Blessing given, the ring is on; And at God's Altar radiant run The currents of two lives in one! Hushed with happiness, every sense Is crowded at the heart intense; And silence hath most eloquence! Down to his feet her meek eyes stoop, As there her love should pour its cup; But, like a King, he lifts them up. Her flashing face to heaven up-turns, There for a Mother's kiss it yearns: Through all her life Hope's sunrise burns! And now she trembles to his breast, To proudly crown his loving quest; And make it aye her happy nest. His arms her hyacinth head caress, And fold her fragrant slenderness, With all its touching tenderness. Now, on heaven's coast of crystal, crowned Hesperus lights life's outward-bound: And Evening palls her purple round. A palace rich with glorious shows She maketh his life's narrow house To-night: but there he keeps no rouse! Alone they hold their marriage-feast: Fresh from the Chrism of the Priest, He would not have the happiest jest To storm her brows with a crimson fine; And, sooth, they need no wings of wine To waft them into Love's divine. So Strength and Beauty, hand-in-hand, Go forth into the honeyed land, Lit by the love-moon golden-grand, Where God hath built their Bridal-bower; And on the top of life they tower, To taste their Eden's perfect hour. No lewd eyes o'er my shoulder look! They do but ope the blessed book Of Marriage, in their hallowed nook. O, flowery be the paths they press, And ruddiest human fruitage bless Them, with a lavish loveliness! Melodious move their wedded life Through shocks of time, and storms of strife,â Husband true, and perfect wife! WEDDED LOVE. The summer Night comes brooding over Earth, As Love comes brooding down on human hearts, With bliss that hath no utterance save rich tears. She floats in fragrance through the smiling dark, Foldeth a kiss upon the lips of Life, Curtaineth into rest the weary world, And shuts us in with all our hid delight. The stars come sparkling through the tender gloom, Like dew-drops in the fields of heaven; or tears That hang their jewels on the face of Night. A spirit-feel comes down the calm, and soft The Flowers fold their cups like praying hands, And with drooped head await the blessing, Night Gives with her Motherly magnanimity. 'Tis evening with the world; but in my soul The light of wedded love is still at dawn Around my world, an everlasting Dawn. My heart rings out in music, like a Lark Hung in the charmÃ¨d palace of the Morn, That circles singing to its mate i' the nest, With luminous being running o'er in song: So my life flutters round its mate at home! There, with her eyes turned on her heart, she reads The golden secrets written in its book, And broodeth o'er its hidden wealth of love, As Night i' the hush and halo of her beauty Bares throbbing heaven to its most tremulous depths, And broods in silence o'er her starry wealth. And, fingering in her bosom's soft, white nest, A fair babe, beautiful as Dawn in heaven, Made of a Mother's richest thoughts of love,â Lies like a smile of sunshine among lilies, That giveth gloryâdrinking fragrant life. Sweet bud upon a Rose! our plot of spring, And burst of bloom amid a wintry world! How dear it is to mark the look of life Deepen, and darken, in her large, round eyes,â To watch the other rose put forth its leaves, And guess the perfumed secret of its heart; To catch the silver words that come to break The golden silence hung like heaven around! But lo, my hush of thought is thrilling, as A wood at night brims o'er with sudden song: Dear Wife! with rich, low voice, she syllables Some precious music hoarded in her heart, And I am flooded with melodious rain, Like Nature standing crowned with sunlit showers. âAs the heaving heart o' the Sea yearneth everlastingly For the Moon, heaven-charmÃ¨d by her influence: And as Star to Star with love palpitateth like a dove, So my heart yearns up to his bright eminence. âFor my Love, he seems to stand where Heaven leans so near at hand, That from other worlds his lineaments take light: And he fills my cup of wonder, flooding all my life with splendour, As a glorious, golden Moon fills all the night. âAt the music of his words my heart carols like a bird's, And rich instincts burst from out it like heaven-flowers; Wings bud in me at his kiss, all my being brims with bliss, As a valley brims with life in spring-tide hours. âFor my life was dark and cold as the night-dews on the wold, Waiting to be made alive with fire of dawn; Till his presence on me lightened, and his blessing on me brightened, And my life like dews lit up for heaven shone.â Nay, Sweet Heart! that should be my song, who search Love's lore in vain for fit similitudes To symbol what thy love hath been to me. The God lies prisoned in the mountain stone, The muffled Music slumbers in the strings, Awaiting the Deliverer's magic touch! So, thou belovÃ¨d! did I wait for Thee, To waken at thy touch. My Tree of being But made blind gropings in the dark, cold earth, And moaned and trembled in the wintry air, Stretching out naked hands to pluck at life: Until you came, with all your light, and warmth, Encircling round it like a summer heaven, And fed, and clad it with your fragrant beauty, Till budding branches burst on fire with bloom, And into ripe fruits mellowed goldenly. My life lay barren as a desolate moor That breaks, and burns, in twinkling green and gold, When Spring gives greeting with her kiss of life. As weary earth goes darkling through the night, So my heart toiled on, tearful with its burthen: No beacon burned through all the gloom, to break The sea of dark, with shining piers of light: Then on a sudden rose the blessed Morn, Sun-crowned my life, made all things beautiful, And gave the world its Eden-robes again. My spirit rose up orient with light; Thy presence caught my heart up at the leap, Winged like a young world from the hands of God! Methought a thousand graves of buried hopes Could crush it not from its proud eminence. The Future's dim cloud-curtain rent in twain, And lightened radiant revelation: All Life's purpose dawned, as unto dying eyes The dark of Death doth glisten into stars. And since we met, thy life-long thought hath been To be cup-bearer of the wine of joy To one leal heart, and to make rich one life. Pulse after pulse, thy life hath mixed with mine, Like sea-waves hurrying up the beach to crown Their shore, and break in starry showers of light. Thou hast brought radiant sunrise every morn, Renewing all the glory passed away. Thy tender love hath twined about my life, Like the fair Woodbine wedded to the Thorn; Hiding its harshness with her wealth of flowers! My heart drinks inspiration at thine eyes, And lights my brain up as with fragrant flame: Sweet eyes of starry tenderness, through which The soul of some immortal sorrow looks! Sorrow that addeth grace to loveliness, As its sad bloom enricheth the ripe fruit. Dear Eyes! they have a radiant Alchemy, And pierce my being with such quickening light As makes my heart a jewel-mine of love; Even as the Sun strikes through the dark cold Earth, And fires her million veins with precious life. My Life ran like a river in rocky ways, And seaward dashed, a sounding cataract! But thine was like a quiet lake of beauty, Soft-shadowed round by gracious influences, That gathers silently its wealth of earth, And woos heaven till it melts down into it. They mingled: and the glory, and the calm, Closed round me, brooding into perfect rest. O blessings on thy true and tender heart! How it hath gone forth like the Dove of old, To bring some leaf of promise in Life's deluge! Thou hast a strong up-soaring tendency, That bears me God-ward, as the stalwart oak Uplifts the clinging vine, and gives it growth. Thy reverent heart familiarly doth take Unconscious clasp of high and holy things, And trusteth where it may not understand. We have had sorrows, love! and wept the tears That run the rose-hue from the cheek of Life; But Grief hath jewels as Night hath her stars, And she revealeth what we ne'er had known, With Joy-wreaths danced about o'er our blinded eyes. The heart is like an instrument whose strings Steal nobler music from Life's many frets: The golden threads are spun through Suffering's fire, Wherewith the marriage-robes for heaven are woven: And all the rarest hues of human life Take radiance, and are rainbowed out in tears. Thou'rt little changed, dear love! since we were wed. Thy beauty hath climaxed like a crescent Moon, With glory greatening to the golden full. Thy flowers of spring are crowned with summer fruits, And thou hast put a queenlier presence on With thy regality of Womanhood! Yet Time but toucheth thee with mellowing shades That set thy graces in a wealthier light. Thy soul still looks with its rare smile of love, From the Gate Beautiful of its palace-home, Fair as the spirit of the evening Star, That lights its glory as a radiant porch To beacon earth with brighter glimpse of heaven. We are poor in this world's wealth, but rich in love; And they who love feel rich in everything. The heart of Oceanâthick with gems, as earth With bloomsâis jewelled like a Bride o' the East: The heart of Heaven swarms with golden worlds: A subtle heart of wealth hath our old world, And darks of diamonds, grand as nights of stars: But richer is the human heart that shrines The peerless wealthâth' immortal jewel Love! So let us live our life! and let our love, Our large twin-love, above our children bend, As the calm grand old heavens bend over earth, Revealing God's own starry thoughts and things; So shall the image of our hearts' Idealâ The angel nestling in their bud of lifeâ Smile upward in the mirror of their face A daily beauty in our darkened ways, And a perpetual feast of holy things. O let us walk the world, so that our love Burn like a blessed beacon, beautiful Upon the walls of Life's surrounding dark. Ah! what a world 'twould be if love like ours Made heaven in human hearts, and clothed with smiles The sweet sad face of our Humanity! What lives should quicken into sudden spring! What flowers of glory burst their frozen soil! As the red pulse of Dawn through cold gray skies, New life should flush up in the darkened face That readeth like a mourning epitaph Above the grave of beauty and of soul! A light should glimmer on the Helot's brow, And love should come into the mirkest being As mellowest moonlight silvers through the cloud. 1851. THE MOTHER'S IDOL BROKEN. Tenderly did he usher us within The holy of holies of a Father's heart, Where gloomed the first great sorrow still and sternâ The dark, unfeatured Guestânow fading slow In hallowed, healing light. Ah, few there be But miss some sweetest thing Earth lifted up In her old arms to take Heaven's blessingâpure As white foam-spirit flashing to the Moon, And gone as quickly from our mortal night. I. Twice the Mother had divÃ¨d down Into her sea of sorrow; O my love! O my life! my own sweet Wife! God send you a merry good-morrow. Betide her weal, or betide her woe, Her smile it was calm and fearless; And proud were her eyes as she rose with the prize, A pearl in her palms! my Peerless! O found you a little Sea-Syren, In some perilous palace left? Or is it a little Child-Angel, Of her high-born kin bereft? Or came she out of the Elfin-land, By earthly love beguiled? Or hath the sweet Spirit of Beauty Taken shape as our starry Child? Dear, do but look in her love-nest of sweets, Where she lies in a smiling calm: Wee armful of fruitage; a sheaf of ripe bliss; On a bosom breathing balm. Pure as the drop of dew, pride of the morn, On leaves of a lily in blossom; Fresh as the fragrance newly born In a violet's virgin bosom! II. God's Butterfly drawn to the flower of our love! It seemeth the beautiful thing, At the first surmise of the heaven she hath left, For the Winterless World may wing. So we fold her about with our love as 'twere heaven, Around her weave many a wile; And our hearts up-leap, living fountains of joy, In the golden dream of her smile. III. On my ripely rounding Rose-tree, Dreaming of life are three flowers: One pusheth up her ruby-rose-cup, For the rain of God's quickening showers. With a magical burst of beauty, one glows Dewily-dear in the sheen of love; And one pretty Softling, our baby-bud-rose, Lies tenderly shut in the green of love. IV. O fair befall my dainty flowers, Summering on their stem; Smiling up to the crowning Rose, As she smileth down upon them. Smiling up to their Queen in her beauty, That smiles on each bonny breast-gem: Blossoming, brimming with love for her Who leans ruddy with love over them! O fair befall my dainty flowers, Summering on their stem! And O the armful of rich love, My fragrant human posies! Smile on them all, sweet Heaven, And kiss my darling Roses. V. There be three little Maidens; three loving Maidens; Three bonny Maidens mine; Three precious jewels are set in Life's crown, On prayer-lifted brows to shine. Six starry eyes, all love-luminous, Look out of our heaven so tender; Since the Honey-moon, glowing and glorious, Arose in its ripening splendour. There's Lilybell, Duchess of Wonderland, With dance of life, dimples and curls; Whose bud of a mouth will burst into flower A-smile with the wanton white pearls: And Sweetcheek, our rosily-goldening peach On the sunniest side o' the wall, But Marian's Mother's darling, Marian's Idol of all. VI. Like the merry voice-bird that sings on the bough, I sing, O my woman Dove, To a nest I know in the leaves below, Full of eyes alive with love. Two of our little Birds wander on wings, One can but flutter and fall; Sing, Marian Mother's wee darling, Marian's Idol of all. VII. Parents of Children three; Two of them ruddy with glee; One your White Child, your Pearl! Do you feel as I feel with my Girl? For I peer in her tender face, And I fear that its light of grace Is too still and too starry a birth For our noisy, dim dwellings of Earth. She looks like a Changeling child Of the heavensâtoo lustrous, too mild For us. Other Roses are blowing While ours seems upfolding and going,â Dreamily happy in going. Yet on it more soft is the thorn Than the tiniest little snail's horn, And golden at heart is the Morn Of a day that will never be born. Just a spirit of light is my Girl, Seen through a body of pearl; A spirit of life that will fleet Away, more on wings than on feet. Her cheek is so waxenly thin, As if deathward 'twere dimpling in, And the cloud of her flesh, still more white Were clearing till soul is in sight. She leans as the wind-flowers stoop; All their loveliness seen as they droop! Her eyes have the sweet native hue Of the heaven they are melting into, Blue as the Violets above The grave of some tender babe-love That back to us wistfully bring The buried blue eyes with the Spring. Her large eyes too liquidly glister! Her mouth is too red. Have they kissed herâ The Angels that bend down to pull Our buds of the Beautiful, And whispered their own little Sister? O Parents of children three! Two of them bright of blee; One, your White Child, your Pearl! Do you feel as I feel with my Girl? For I think I could give half her wealth Of heaven for a little more health: The halo of Saints for the simple Blithe graces that dip in a dimple! Nay, I feel in my heart I could revel To see but a wee dash of devil; A touch of the old Adam in her; A glimpse of his fair fellow-sinner; Any likeness of earth that would give Me a promise my Darling should live. I feel I could prayââO my Maker, Take me too, if Thou must take her.â VIII. All in our Marriage Garden Grew, smiling up to God, A bonnier Flower than ever Sucked the warmth of sun and sod. O beautiful unfathomably Its little life unfurled; Love's crowning sweetness was our wee White Rose of all the world. From out a balmy bosom, Our Bud of Beauty grew; It fed on smiles for sunshine, And tears for daintier dew. Aye nestling warm and tenderly, Our leaves of love were curled So close and close about our wee White Rose of all the world. Two flowers of glorious crimson Grew with our Rose of light; Still kept the sweet heaven-grafted slip Her whiteness saintly white. They caught the breeze and danced with glee; They reddened as it whirled; White, white and wondrous grew our wee White Rose of all the world. With mystical faint fragrance, Our House of Life she filledâ Revealed each hour some Fairy Tower, Where wingÃ¨d Hopes might build. We sawâthough none like us might seeâ Such precious promise pearled Upon the petals of our wee White Rose of all the world. But evermore the halo Of Angel-light increased; Like the mystery of Moonlight, That folds some fairy feast. Snow-white, snow-soft, snow-silently, Our darling bud up-curled, And dropped i' the Grave-God's lapâour wee White Rose of all the world. Our Rose was but in blossom; Our life was but in spring; When down the solemn midnight We heard the Spirits sing: âAnother bud of infancy, With holy dews impearled;â And in their hands they bore our wee White Rose of all the world. You scarce could think so small a thing Would leave a loss so large; Her little light such shadow fling, From Dawn to Sunset's marge. In other Springs our life may be In other flowers unfurled; But never, never match our wee White Rose of all the world. IX. This is a curl of little Marian's hair! A ring of sinless gold that weds two worlds! Our one thing left with her dear life in it. Poor Misers! o'er it secretly we sum Our little savings hoarded up above,â Our rich love-thoughts heart-hid to doat upon,â And glimpse our lost heaven in a flood of tears. A magic ring, through which fond Sorrow reads Of strange heart-histories, and conjures up A vanished face, with its sweet spirit-smiles, Babe-wonderings, and little tender ways. At birth her hair was dark as it were dipped In the death-shadow; but it rarefied In radiance as her head rose nigher heaven, Till sheâwhite Glory!âlooked from a golden midst. This is her still face as she lay in death! Spirit-like face, set in a silver cloud, It comes to us in silent glooms of night; The wee wan face that gradually withdrew And darkened into the great cloud of death. O ye who say, âWe have a Child in heaven;â And know how far away that heaven may seem; Who have felt the desolate isolation sharp Defined in Death's own face; who have stood beside The Silent River, and stretched out pleading hands For some sweet Babe upon the other bank, That went forth where no human hand might lead, And left the shut house with no light, no sound, No answer, when the Mourners wail without! What we have known, ye know, ye only know. She came like April, who with tender grace Smiles in Earth's face, and sets upon her breast The bud of all her glory yet to come, Then bursts in tears, and takes her sorrowful leave. She brought heaven to us just within the space Of the dear depths of her large, dream-like eyes, Then o'er the vista fell the death-veil dark. She only caught three words of human speech: One for her Mother, one for me, and one She crowed with, for the fields, and open air. That last she sighed with a sharp farewell pathos A minute ere she left the house of life, To come for kisses never any more. Pale Blossom! how she leaned in love to us! And how we feared a hand might reach from heaven To pluck our sweetest flower, our loftiest flower Of life, that sprang from lowliest root of love! Some tender trouble in her eyes complained Of Life's rude stream, as meek Forget-me-nots Make sweet appeal when winds and waters fret. And oft she looked beyond Us with sad eyes, As for the coming of the Unseen Hand. We saw, but feared to speak of, her strange beauty, As some hushed Bird that dares not sing i'the night, Lest lurking foe should find its secret place, And seize it through the dark. With twin-love's strength All crowded in the softest nestling-touch, We fenced her roundâexchanging silent looks. We went about the house with listening hearts, That kept the watch for Danger's stealthiest step, Our spirits felt the Shadow ere it fell. Then the Physician left our door ajar A moment, and the grim thief Death stole in. Some Angel passing o'er Life's troubled sea, Had seen our Jewel shine celestial pure, And Death must win it for her bosom-pearl. We stood at Midnight in the Presence dread. At midnight, when Men die, we strove with Death, To wrench our jewel from his grasping hand. Ere the soul loosed from its last ledge of life, Her little face peered round with anxious eyes, Then, seeing all the old faces, dropped content. The mystery dilated in her look, Which, on the darkening death-ground, faintly caught Some likeness of the Angel shining near. Her passing soul flashed back a glimpse of bliss. She was a Child no more, but strong and stern As a mailed Knight that had been grappling Death. A crown of conquest bound her baby-brow; Her little hands could take the heirdom large; And all her Childhood's vagrant royalty Sat staid and calm in some eternal throne. Love's kiss is sweet, but Death's doth make immortal. The Mornings came, with all their glory on; Birds, brooks, and bees were singing in the sun, Earth's blithe heart breathing bloom into her face, The flowers all crowding up like Memories Of lovelier life in some forgotten world, Or dreams of peace and beauty yet to come. The soft south-breezes rocked the baby-buds In fondling arms upon a balmy breast; And all was gay as universal life Swam down the stream that glads the City of God. But we lay dark where Death had struck us down With that stern blow which made us bleed within, And bow while the Inevitable went by. And there our little one lay in coffined calm; Beyond the breakers and the moaning now! And o'er her flowed the white, eternal peace: All dim the living lustres motion makes! No life-dew in the sweet cups of her eyes! The breathing miracle into silence passed: Never to stretch wee hands, with her dear smile As soft as light-fall on unfolding flowers; Never to wake us crying in the night: Our little hindering thing for ever gone, We might toil on in tearful quiet now. A young Immortal came to us disguised, And in the joy-dance dropped her mask, and fled. Nought there of our wee darling save the mask. The world went lightly by and heeded not Our death-white windows blinded to the sun; The hearts that ached within; the measureless loss; The Idol broken; our first tryst with Death. O Life, how strange thy face behind the veil! And stranger yet will thy strange mystery look, When we awake in death and tell our Dream. 'Tis hard to solve the secret of the Sphinx! We had a little gold Love garnered up, To richly robe our Babe: the Mother's half Was turned to mourning-raiment for her dead: Mine bought the first land we called oursâHer grave. We were as treasure-seekers in the earth, When lo, a death's-head on a sudden stares. Clad all in her babe-beauty forth she went; Her budding spring of life in tiny leaf; Her faint dawn whitened in the perfect day. Our early wede awa' went back to God, Bearing her life-scroll folded, without stain, And only three words written on itâtwo Our names! Ah, may they plead for us in heaven! X. Very softly hold the Rose, On thy happy breast that blows! Thus from out my heart there sprang a flower of tender pride. All too wild my passion burned: For the cooling dews it yearned: In my hot hands drooped my gentle flower and died. Be thy glory meekly worn: Fairest fruit is lowliest borne: Mine grew high as Life could climb, and arms could reach above. O, so proudly heaved my breast; All the world should see how blest; And the seeing Heavens took my lifted love. XI. There is her nest where balmily smiled Our Babe, as we leaned above; There she asked with her face for the tenderest place In all our world of love. Very silent and empty now! yet we feel It rock; and a tiny footfall Comes over the floor in the thrilling night-hush, And our hearts leap up for the call Of our puir wee lammie dead and gone; Our bonnie wee lammie dead and gone. Last night, with hands to cracking clasped In the furnace-fire of my heart, Sitting, I saw the dead world All into spirit-life start At the mystic touch of the white Moonlight. My spirit arose likewise, And wandered away to the Graveyard, Where, a jewel in Death's hand, lies Our puir wee lammie dead and gone; Our bonnie wee lammie dead and gone. Slowly, slowly uprose the dead, All in their robes of white! Weirdly, weirdly uprose the dead, All in the silent night! Like lilies for God, from the dark grave-bed, They grew in a glory-rain; And the crownÃ¨d Darling of Heaven, at the head Of all that glorified train, Was our puir wee lammie dead and gone; Our bonnie wee lammie dead and gone. In my dream I stood at the death-door dark, Alone and tremblingly, Till a Shining One came in a crescent bark, Moonlike, o'er a purple sea. She smiled to say that she knew the way, And at some secret sign, A memory of the old life stirred, And I knew that Angel mine! Our puir wee lammie dead and gone; Our bonnie wee lammie dead and gone. XII. Within a mile of Edinburgh Town We laid our little darling down; Our first seed in God's acre sown! So sweet a place! Death looked beguiled Of half his gloom; or softly smiled To win our wondrous spirit-child. God giveth His Beloved sleep So calm, within its silence deep, As Angel-guards the watch might keep. The City looketh solemn and sweet; It bares a gentle brow, to greet The Mourners mourning at its feet. The sea of human life breaks round This shore o' the dead, with softened sound: Wild-flowers climb each mossy mound To place in resting hands their palm, And breathe their beauty, bloom, and balm; Folding the dead in fragrant calm. A lighter shadow Grief might wear; And old Heartache come gather there The peace that falleth after prayer. Poor heart, that danced among the vines All reeling-ripe with sweet love-wines, Thou walk'st with Death among the pines! Lorn Mother, at the dark grave-door, She kneeleth, pleading o'er and o'er, But it is shut for evermore. Blind, blind! She feels, but cannot read Aright; then leans as she would feed The dear dead lips that never heed. The spirit of life may leap above, But in that grave her prisoned Dove Lies, cold to th' warm embrace of love, And dark, though all the world is bright; And lonely, with a City in sight; And desolate in the rainy night. Ah, God! when in the glad life-cup The face of Death swims darkly up; The crowning flower is sure to droop! And so we laid our Darling down, When Summer's face grew ripely brown, And still, though grief hath milder grown, Unto the Stranger's land we cleave, Like some poor Birds that grieve and grieve, Round the robbed nest, and cannot leave. XIII. Ah, the sweet Dream, the singing Dream, that sang We knew not what, so sweet the melody! Made dim woe glimmer golden while we slept; And when we woke the lulling Dream was gone. We who had glowed like Angels in the sun, With life so lighted by her loveliness: We let her down into the drowning gloom, Sailing the awful Sea in our World-bark. God's messenger of death seems blindly stern: And 'tis so hard to leave a little babe Within the Grave's cold arms, alone! while Sorrow Comes Home and chills the nest her sweet life warmed. So little to the world! but what a world Of difference in our little world of home! This Stillness where the sweet Bird chirped to us; This good-night-parting, this morn-greeting loss. And yet perchance the kind dark-Angel drew Her in the secret shadow of his cloud, Out of our warm and golden air, to hide Her from some fearful Fate far-hurrying up? XIV. To-day, when winds of Winter blow, And Nature sits in dream of snow, With Ugolino-look of woe: Wife from the window came to me, Now leaves were fallen she could see That wee grave in the Cemet'ry. With wintriness all life did ache For that dead darling's sainted sake; And lips might kiss, but hearts would quake. Ho, ye who pass her narrow house, By which the dark Leith sea-ward flows; O clasp your pretty nurslings close; And if some tender bud of light Is drooping, as the snowdrop white, With looks that weird wild heart strings smite Think of our babe that will not wake, And fold your own till fond hearts ache, Sweet souls, for little Marian's sake. XV. O happy Tree; Green and fragrant Tree; Spring with budding jewels decked it like a Bride! All so fair it bloomed, And the summer air perfumed; Golden autumn fruitage smiled in crowns of pride. O human tree; Waesome wailing tree; In the winter wind how it rocks! how it grieves! On a little low grave-mound, All its bravery lies discrowned: O'er its fallen fruit it heaps the withered leaves. XVI. âPretty flowers on Baby's head; Who'll cry flowers when Baby's dead?â Singing hearts oft questionÃ¨d, In the sweetest Summer fled. Marian, Marian. Tearful words, how lightly said! Mournfully rememberÃ¨d, Now the sweet New Year doth spread Blossom-life on Baby's bed. Marian, Marian. Tender emerald, white and red, Flowers of her beauty bred: Breathing all of her that's dead, Cry, âWe crown her Baby-head!â Marian, Marian. âWho'll cry flowers when Baby's dead?â Praying looks to heaven are led, And it smiles as though it said, âEarly her sweet fame hither sped.â Marian, Marian. âFaith, look up and firmly tread: Poor Bereaved, be comforted; I will nurse the Child instead; My Flowers garland Baby's head.â Marian, Marian. God's unguessed reply is read: Tears that came not, tears that pled Crying darkly, here are shed: Soft rest you, Darling! dead Marian, Marian. XVII. Our leaves are shaken from the Tree, Our hopes laid low, That after our Spring-nurslings, we May long to go. The warm love-nest our little Doves leave With helpless moan, As they for us at heart would grieve In heavenâalone! The tender Shepherd beckoningly Our Lambs doth hold, That we may take our own when He Makes up the fold. XVIII. With seeking hearts we still grope on, Where dropped our jewel in the dust: The looking crowd have long since gone, And still we seek with lonely trust: O little Child with radiant eyes! In all our heart-ache we are drawn, Unweeting, to your little grave; There, on your heavenly shores of dawn, Breaks gentlier Sorrow's sobbing wave: O little Child with radiant eyes! Dark underneath the brightening sod, The sweetest life of all our years Is crowded in ae gift to God,â Outside the gate we stand in tears. O little Child with radiant eyes! Heart-empty as the Acorn-cup That only fills with wintry showers; The breaking cloud but brimmeth up With tears this pleading life of ours. O little Child with radiant eyes! We think of you, our Angel kith, Till life grows light with starry leaven: We never forget you, Darling with The gold hair waving high in heaven; Our little Child with radiant eyes! Your white wings grown you will conquer Death! You are coming through our dreams even now, With azure peep of heaven beneath The arching glory of your brow, Our little Child with radiant eyes! We cannot pierce the dark, but oft You see us with looks of pitying balm; A hint of heavenâa touch more soft Than kissesâall the trouble is calm. Our little Child with radiant eyes! Think of us wearied in the strife, And when we sit by Sorrow's streams, Shake down upon our drooping life The dew that brings immortal dreams. Our little Child with radiant eyes! XIX. Come hither, Friends! Come hither, Friends! So great the joy our Father sends, I want to share with you. For He hath made the blind receive New sight! Come, help me to believe The miracle is true! âO what the joy? and whence the beam That lights your look as with the gleam Of waters in the waste?â Come kneel by me on bended knee; Ye must stoop low if ye would see,â Lower, if ye would taste! Sweet Friends, ye know the little grave To which my heart would crawl and crave, As 'twere a worm o' the dust? I writhed so low, it rose so high, The mound that shut out all my sky; So broken was my trust. This morn I sought it! hardly one Of all my unshed tears would run; Insteadâfrom out the sodâ A spring had gushed through dust and weeds! And in the light of God it feeds My life, direct from God. XX. Spring comes with violet eyes unveiled, Her fragrant lips apart! And Earth smiles up as though she held Most honeyed thoughts at heart. But nevermore will Spring arise Dancing in sparkles of her eyes. A gracious wind low-breathing comes As from the fields of God; The old lost Eden newly blooms From out the sunny sod. My buried joy stirs with the earth, And tries to sun its sweetness forth. The Trees move in their slumbering, Dreaming of one that's near! Put out their feelers for the Spring, To wake, and find her here! My spirit on the threshold stands, And stretches out its waiting hands; Then goeth from me in a stream Of yearning; wave on wave Slides through the stillness of a dream, To little Marian's grave: For all the miracle of Spring My long lost Child will never bring. Where blooms the golden crocus-burst, And Winter's tenderling, There lies our little Snowdrop,âfirst Of Flowers in our love's spring! How all the year's young beauties blow About her there, I know, I know. The Blackbird with his warble wet, The Thrush with reedy thrill, Open their hearts to Heav'n, and let The influence have its will! Though all around the Spring hath smiled, She seems to have kissed where lies my child. In purple shadow and golden shine Old Arthur's Seat is crowned; Like shapes of Silence crystalline The great white clouds sail round! The Dead at rest the long day through Lie calm against the pictured blue. At shut of Eve the stars may peep, But still there comes no night; Only the Day hath fallen asleep, And smiles in dreams of light: As though she felt the heart of Love Beat on in silent stars above. O Marian, my maid Marian, So strange it seems to me! That you, the Household's darling one, So soon should cease to be. Ah, was it that our praying breath Might kindle heavenward fires of faith? So much forgiven for your sake When bitter words were said, And little arms about the neck With blessings bowed the head! So happy as we might have been, Our hearts more close with you between. Dear early Dew-drop! such a gleam Of sun from heaven you drew, We little thought that smiling beam Would drink the precious dew! But back to heaven our dew was kissed, We saw it pass in mournful mist. Our lowly home was lofty-crowned With three sweet budding girls! Our Marriage-ring was wreathen round With darling wee love-pearls! One jewel from the ring is gone, One fills a grave in Warriston. We bore her beauty in our breast, As heaven bears the Dawn, We brooded over her dear nest, Still close and closer drawn. Hearts thrilled and listened, watched and throbbed, And strayed not,âyet the nest was robbed. âStay yet a little while, Beloved!â In vain our prayerful breath: Across heaven's lighted window moved The shadow of black Death. In vain our hands were stretched to save; There closed the gateways of the Grave! Could my death-vision have darkened up In her sweet face, my child; I scarce should see the bitter cup I could have drunk and smiled: Blessing her with my last-wrung breath, Dear Angel in my dream of death. Her memory is like music we Have heard some singer sing, That thrills life through, and echoingly Our hearts forever ring; We try it o'er and o'er again, But ne'er recall that wondrous strain. My proud heart like a river runs, Lying awake o' nights; I see her with the shining Ones Upon the shining heights. And a wee Angel-face will peep Down starlike through the veil of sleep. My yearnings try to get them wings And float me up afar, As in the Dawn the Skylark springs To reach some distant Star That all night long swam down to him In brightness, but at morn grew dim. She is a spirit of light that leavens The darkness where we wait; And starlike opens in the heavens A little golden gate! O may we wake and find her near When work and sleep are over here! No sweetness to this world of ours Is without purpose given, The fragrance that goes up from flowers May be their seed in Heaven. We saw Heaven in her face, may we Her future face in Heaven see. In some far spring of brighter bloom, More life, and ampler breath, My bud hath burst the folding gloom, A-flower from dusty death! We wonder will she be much grown? And how will her new name be known? I saw her ribboned robe this morn, Mine own lost little child; Wee shoes her tiny feet had worn, And then my heart grew wild. We only trust ourselves to peep In on them when we want to weep. But hearts will break or eyes must weep, And so we bend above These treasures of old days that keep The fragrance of young love. The harvest-field though reaped and bare Still hath two patient gleaners there. I never think of her sweet eyes In dusky death now dim, But waters of my heart will rise, And there they smile and swim, Forget-me-nots so blue, so dear, Swim in the waters of a tear. How often in the days gone by She lifted her dear head, And stretched wee arms for me to lie Down in her little bed; And cradled in my happy breast Was softly carried into rest. And now when life is sore oppressed And runs with weary wave, I long to lay me down and rest In little Marian's grave: To smile as peaceful as she smiledâ For I am now the nestling child. Immortal Love, a spirit of bliss And brightness, moves above, While here forever Sorrow is A shadow cast by Love. But love for her no sorrow will bring And no more tearful leaves-taking. No passing sorrows on their march Will leave sad foot-prints now, No troubles strain the tender arch Of that white baby brow. No cares to cloud, no tears that come To rob the cheek of dainty bloom. All sweetest shapes that Beauty wears Are round about her drawn; Auroral hues, and vernal airs, And blessings of the dawn; All loveliness that ne'er grows less; Time cannot touch her tenderness. The patient calm that comes with years, Hath made us cease to fret, Though sometimes in the sudden tears Dumb hearts will quiver yet: And each one turns the face, and tries To hide Who looks through parent eyes. LYRICS OF LOVE. SWEET SPIRIT OF MY LOVE. Sweet Spirit of my love! Through all the world we walk apart: Thou mayst not in my bosom lie; I may not press Thee to my heart Nor see the love-thoughts light thine eye: Yet art Thou with me. All my life Orbs out in thy warm beauty's sphere; My loftiest dreams of Thee are rife, And coloured with thy presence dear. Sweet Spirit of my love! I know how beautiful Thou art, But never tell the starry thought: I only whisper to my heart, âShe lights with heaven thy earthliest spot.â And birds that night and day rejoice, And winds and waves give back to me Their music murmuring of thy voice; And warble into songs of Thee. Sweet Spirit of my love! No Spring, or Summer bloom-bedight, That garlands earth with rainbow-showers; No breath of Morn, or eyes that Light Doth open in the waking flowers; No Bee goes honey-laden by, No flash of water, sigh of tree; Never a New Moon mounts the sky But draws my heart's love-tide to Thee! Sweet Spirit of my love! When Night's soft silence clothes the earth, To wake the passionate bird of love, And Stars laugh out in lofty mirth, And yearning souls divinelier move; When Stillness hallows every spot, And, lapped in feeling's luxury, The heart's break-full of tender thought; Then art Thou with me, still with me. Sweet Spirit of my love! I listen for thy footfall, feel Thy look is burning on me, such As reads my heart; 'twill sometimes reel And throb, expectant for thy touch! For by the voice of birds and brooks, And flowers with dews of heaven wet, And earnest stars with yearning looks, I know that we shall mingle yet. Sweet Spirit of my love! Strange places on me smile, as Thou Hadst passed, and left thy beauty's tints: Even the wild flowers seem to know, And light and shade flash mystic hints. Methinks, like olden Gods, Thou'lt come In cloud; but mine anointed eyes Shall see the glory burn through gloom, And clasp Thee, Sweet! with large surprise. NOT I, SWEET SOUL, NOT I. All glorious as the Rainbow's birth, She came in Spring-tide's golden hours; When Heaven went hand-in-hand with Earth, And May was crowned with buds and flowers. The mounting devil at my heart Clomb faintlier, as my life did win The charmÃ¨d heaven, she wrought apart, To wake its better Angel in. With radiant mien she trode serene, And passed me smiling by! O! who that looked could help but love? Not I, sweet soul, not I. The dewy eyelids of the Dawn Ne'er oped such heaven as hers did show: It seemed her dear eyes might have shone As jewels in some starry brow. Her face flashed glory like a shrine, Or lily-bell with sunburst bright; Where came and went love-thoughts divine, As low winds walk the leaves in light: She wore her beauty with the grace Of Summer's star-clad sky; O! who that looked could help but love? Not I, sweet soul, not I. Her budding breasts like fragrant fruit Of love were ripening to be pressed: Her voice, that shook my heart's red root, Might not have broken a Babe's rest,â More liquid than the running brooks; More vernal than the voice of Spring, When Nightingales are in their nooks, And all the leafy thickets ring. The love she coyly hid at heart Was shyly conscious in her eye; O! who that looked could help but love? Not I, sweet soul, not I. LOVE ME. âAll dear as the feeling when first flowers start, Thou cam'st in thy musical lightness: And the cloud wept itself in rich rain on my heart, That had hidden thy beauty and brightness. 'Twas as Life's topmost window oped suddenly, bright With the glittering face of an Angel, The sweet secret out-flashed on thy forehead of light, And thy voice was thy own love's Evangel! O how shall I crown thee, Love, on my heart's throne, Thou art so far, far above me?â And aye, as her dear eyes looked love in my own, The Maiden answered, âLove me.â âMy BelovÃ¨d is fair as some beautiful Star That walks in a pleasaunce of glory; And her large-hearted looks and her lineaments are As some Queen's of the old Greek story! There's never night now, since those dear eyes of thine Smiled on me with soft sweet splendour, And I drank of the wine of thy kisses divine: O what for such love shall I render?â And aye, as I knelt at my true Love's shrine, She bent in her beauty above me: And aye, as her dear eyes looked love into mine, The Maiden answered, âLove me.â âO could my heart, mountain-regioned in bliss, Thy life with Love's affluence dower, Thou shouldst have heaven in a world e'en like this, And the joy of a life in each hour! Thou shouldst go forth like a conquering Queen, Reaping rich heartfuls of treasure, Nor strive where the worn of heart wearily glean But handfuls, in harvesting pleasure.â And aye, as I knelt at my true Love's shrine, She bent in her beauty above me: And aye, as her dear eyes looked love into mine, The Maiden answered, âLove me.â THE PATRIOT TO HIS BRIDE. Can you leave the fond bosom of Home, where Joy hath been from your earliest waking? Can you give its endearments to come, where Life hath many a hot heart-aching? Have you counted the cost to stand by me, In the battle I fight for Man? Shall your womanly love deify me, Who stand under the world's dark ban? A daring high soul you will need, dear Love, To brave the life-battle with me: For your true heart may oftentimes bleed, dear Love, And your sweet eyes dim tearfully. Sweet! know you of gallant hearts perishing,â The fine spirits that dumbly bow? For a little of Fortune's cherishing, They are breaking in agony now! And without the sunshine that life needeth, Alas! Sweet! for me and for you: But little the careless world heedeth For love like ours, tender and true! A daring high soul you will need, dear Love, To brave the life-battle with me: For your true heart may oftentimes bleed, dear Love, And your sweet eyes dim tearfully. Well, you've sworn, I have sworn, God hath bound us, And the world shall not tear us apart: I have flung my love's war-cloak around us, And you live in each pulse of my heart! It may be our name in Earth's story Shall endure when we are no more; For love lives while the Stars burn in glory, And the Flowers bud on Earth's green floor. But a daring high soul you will need, dear Love, To brave the life-battle with me: For your true heart may oftentimes bleed, dear Love, And your sweet eyes dim tearfully. A POOR MAN'S WIFE. Her dainty hand nestled in mine, wee and white, And timid as trembling dove; And it twinkled about me, a jewel of light, As she garnished our banquet of love: 'Twas the queenliest hand in all lady-land, And she but a poor Man's wife! O! little I dreamed how that dainty white hand Could dare in the battle of Life. Her heart it was lowly as maiden's might be, But hath climbed to heroic height, And burned like a shield in defence of me, On the field of sorest fight! And startling as fire, it hath often flashed up In her eyes, the good heart and rare; As she drank down her half of our bitterest cup, And taught me how to bear. Her sweet eyes that seemed, with their smile sublime, Made to look me and light me to heaven, They have triumphed through bitter tears many a time, Since their love to my life was given: And the maiden-meek voice of the womanly Wife Still bringeth the heavens nigher; For it rings like the voice of God over my life, Aye bidding me climb up higher. I hardly dared think it was human, when I first looked in that glorified face; For it shone as the heavens had opened then, And clad it with splendour and grace! But dearer the innermost light of it grew In our dark and most desolate day, As the Rainbow, when heaven hath no break of blue, Smileth the storm away. 'Twas a shape of the lithest Loveliness,â Just an armful of heaven to enfold! But the form that bends flower-like in love's caress, With the Victor's strength may be souled! In the light of her presence transfigured I stand, And the poor Man's English home She fills with the Beauty of Greece the grand, Or the fairest Madonna in Rome. MY BONNY LADY. You say Eve gave her Daughters to restore The Eden that their Mother lost of yore; They lead us through the Angel-guarded door, And where they smile it blooms for evermore? Then Dearest of Eve's Daughters dear is she Who makes an Eden in my Home for me; My Bonny Lady. No seeming beauty perilous to know, Like dream of ripeness on the sour sloe, But sweet to the true heart as summer fruit, And sound and strong to love's most secret root; A soul made human by its kindling life! A woman ripened to the perfect Wife! My Bonny Lady. She grows in graces as the flowers bloom; Her robe of beauty woven in Heaven's loom! She wears her jewels in her lips and eyes: Diamond sparks! warm rubies! pearls of price! And see what shapely sweetness may be shown Supremely, in a simple morning gown! My Bonny Lady. Upon her dear brow is no band of care That binds the heavy burden souls must bear; The dew of childhood's Heaven yet lingering lies Cool in the shadows of her morning eyes; So may some spirit in its brightness wait With welcome at the beautiful heaven-gate. My Bonny Lady. Eyelids once lifted with the kiss of Love, Droop tender after as the brooding dove! Lips, when the soul of joy is tasted, will Hush its loud sound of laughter, and be still. Yet is she happy as the lark that sings, Winnowing out the music with its wings; My Bonny Lady. Lo, how she bows with soft and settled bliss, Over her babe in breathing tenderness! Her image my Madonna bends above, To mingle One in my heart's sea of Love! Thus hath she doubled love and Love's caress, With doubled blessing, doubled power to bless. My Bonny Lady. Her smile the sum of sweetness infinite! Her neck a throne where many graces sit! Like music of the soul her motion is, But none can know the inner sanctities; Outside they stand in wonder, I alone, Pass in adoring at the spirit-throne. My Bonny Lady. Behold her in religious lustre stand, Clothed all in white and fit for spirit-land! Her thankful eyes uplift for angel food; And you might worship her, so pure, so good; For all shy beauty, all sweet shadowy grace, Breaks into brightness through my Lady's face; My Bonny Lady. I think of her and mine eyes softly close While all my heart with sweetness overflows; Each breath it breathes in blessing sets astir Some gracious balm, and sweet as hidden myrrh. My Rest while toiling up the hill of life! A Halfway House to Heaven! my Angel-Wife! My Bonny Lady. HUSBAND AND WIFE. Proudly I stood in the rare Sunrise, As the dawn of your beauty brake; But I feared for the storm, as I looked at the skies, And trembled for your sweet sake! And O, may the evil days come not, I said, As I yearned o'er my tender blossom: Strong arm of love! shelter the dearest one's head; And I nestled you deep in my bosom. May the tears never dim the love-light of her eye,â May her Life be all Spring-weather!â Was the prayer of my heart, ere you, Love, and I, Were Husband and Wife together. But the suns will shine, and the rains will fall, On the loftiest, lowliest spot! And there's mourning and merriment mingled for all That inherit the human lot. So we've suffered and sorrowed and grown more strong, Heart-to-heart, side-to-side, we have striven, With the love that is summer-tide all the year long, And the spirit that makes its own heaven! We clung the more close as the storm swept by, We kept the nest warm in cold weather; And seldom we've faltered since you, Love, and I, Have been Husband and Wife together! Like the sweet happy flowers of the wilderness, You have dwelt life to life with Nature; And caught the wild beauty and grace of her ways, And grown to her heavenlier stature! In prospering calm, and in quickening strife, Hath your womanly worth unfolden; And sunshine and shower have enriched your life, And ripened its harvest golden. There is good in the grimmest cloud o' the sky, There are blessings in wintry weather: Even Grief hath its glory, since you, Love, and I, Have been Husband and Wife together. O, Life is not perfect with Love's first kiss: Who winneth the blessing must wrestle; And the deeper the trouble, the dearer the bliss, That may in the core of it nestle! Our Angels oft greet us in tearful guise, Our saviours will come in sorrow: While the murkiest midnight that frowns from the skies, Is at heart a radiant Morrow! We laugh and we cry, we sing and we sigh, And Life will have wintry weather! So we'll hope, and love on, since you, Love, and I, Are Husband and Wife together. WHEN I COME HOME. Around me Life's hell of fierce Ardours burns, When I come home, when I come home; Over me Heav'n starry-heartedly yearns, When I come home, when I come home. For a feast of Gods garnished, the palace of Night At a thousand star-windows is throbbing with light. London makes mirth! but I think God hears The sobs in the dark, and the dropping of tears; For I feel that He listens down Night's great dome: When I come home, when I come home; Home, home, when I come home, Late in the night when I come home. I walk under Midnight's triumphal arch, When I come home, when I come home; Exulting with life like a Conqueror's march, When I come home, when I come home. I pass by the vast-chambered mansions that shine, Overflowing with splendour like flagons with wine: I have fought, I have vanquished the dragon of Toil, And before me my golden Hesperides smile! And O but Love's Apples make rich the gloam, When I come home, when I come home! Home, home, when I come home, Late in the night when I come home. O the sweet, merry mouths will up-turn to be kissed, When I come home, when I come home! How the younglings yearn from the hungry nest, When I come home, when I come home! My weary, worn heart into sweetness is stirred, And it dances and sings like a singing Bird, On the branch nighest heaven,âa-top of my life: As She meets me and greets me, my welcoming Wife! And her pale cheek is tinted with tenderest bloom, When I come home, when I come home; Home, home, when I come home, Late in the night when I come home. Clouds furl off the shining face of my life, When I come home, when I come home, And leave heaven bare on her bosom, sweet Wife, When I come home, when I come home. With her brave smiling Energies,âFaith warm and bright,â With love glorified and serenely alight,â With her womanly beauty and queenliest calm, She steals to my heart in a blessing of balm; And O but the wine of Love sparkles with foam, When I come home, when I come home! Home, home, when I come home, Late in the night when I come home. LOVE'S FAIRY-RING. While Titans war with social Jove, My own sweet Wife and I, We make Elysium in our love, And let the world go by! O never hearts beat half so light With crownÃ¨d Queen or King! O never world was half so bright As is our fairy-ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. Our world of empire is not large, But priceless wealth it holds; A little heaven links marge to marge, But what rich realms it folds! And clasping all from outer strife Sits Love with folded wing, A-brood o'er dearer life-in-life, Within our fairy ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. Thou leanest thy true heart on mine, And bravely bearest up! Aye mingling Love's most precious wine In Life's most bitter cup! And evermore the circling hours New gifts of glory bring; We live and love like happy flowers, All in our fairy-ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. We've known a many sorrows, Sweet! We've wept a many tears, And often trod with trembling feet Our pilgrimage of years. But when our sky grew dark and wild, All closelier did we cling: Clouds broke to beauty as you smiled, Peace crowned our fairy-ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. Away, you foes of heart and home; Away, O Hate, and Strife! Hence, revellers, reeling drunken from Your feast of human life! Heaven shield our little Goshen round, From ills that with them spring, And never be their footprints found Within our fairy-ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. But, come ye who the Truth dare own, Or work in Love's dear name; Come all who wear the Mystic's crown, Or Martyr's robe of flame! Sweet souls a heartless world may doom Like Birds made blind to sing! For such we'll aye make welcome room Within our fairy-ring, Dear love! Our hallowed fairy-ring. TO THE BELOVED ONE. Heaven hath its crown of Stars, the Earth Her glory-robe of flowersâ The Sea its pearlsâthe grand old Woods Their songs and greening showers: The Birds have homes, where leaves and blooms In beauty wreathe above; High yearning hearts, their rainbow-dreamâ And we, Sweet! we have love. We walk not with the worldly Great, Where Love's dear name is sold; Yet have we wealth we would not give For all their mines of gold! We revel not in Corn and Wine, Yet have we from above Manna divine, and will not pine, While we may live and love. There's sorrow for the toiling poor, On Misery's bosom nursed: Rich robes for ragged souls, and Crowns For branded brows Cain-cursed! But Cherubim, with clasping wings, Ever about us be, And, happiest of God's happy things! There's love for you and me. Thy lips, that kiss till death, have turned Life's water into wine; The sweet life melting through thy looks Hath made my life divine. All Love's dear promise hath been kept, Since thou to me wert given; A ladder for my soul to climb, And summer high in heaven. I know, dear heart! that in our lot May mingle tears and sorrow; But, Love's rich Rainbow's built from tears To-day, with smiles To-morrow. The sunshine from our sky may die, The greenness from Life's tree, But ever, 'mid the warring storm, Thy nest shall sheltered be. I see thee! Ararat of my life, Smiling the waves above! Thou hail'st me Victor in the strife, And beacon'st me with love. The world may never know, dear heart! What I have found in thee; But, though nought to the world, dear heart! Thou'rt all the world to me. MATRIMONY. Two human Stars in passing are Attracted as through heaven they float; Sometimes they form a double Star; Sometimes they put each other out: And sometimes one and one make three, Our World's most perfect Trinity. THE LOVE-LETTER. The Lover felt a warm wave coming Before her Written Message came; The World within and round him blooming Burst into a flower of fragrant flame: As if with mouth to mouth he met her; Or, as two Spirits meet above: âIf such a Wave foreran her letter, How deep the ocean of her love.â LOVE-IN-IDLENESS. We sit serenely 'neath the night, As still as stars with swift delight; In tears, that show how in Life's deep The hidden pearls of beauty sleep! And quiet, as of sleeping trees, And silence, as of dreaming seas. The channels of our bliss run filled, Their faintest happy murmur stilled. Upon thy forehead rests my palm, And on my spirit rests thy calm. I cannot see thy cheek, but know Its tint of rose-bloom hath a glow Like ruby light, and richly lies The dew i' the shadow of thine eyes: Deep eyes! dear wells of tenderness, That ask how they may soothliest bless! Warm incense like the soul o' the South, Is round us, and thy damask mouth With the sweet spirit of its breath, Dissolves me in delicious death. Musk-roses breathing in the gloom, Drop fragrance fainting in the room; Such sensuous sadness fills the air, Ripe life a bloom of dew doth wear. The harping hand hath dulled the lyre Of thrilling heartstringsâby their fire That droops, the dreamy Passions doze In large luxuriance of repose. While we our fields of pleasure reap, Our Babes lie in the wood of Sleep: One, first love's dream of beauty wrought! One the more perfect afterthought. We sit with silent glory crowned, And Love's arms wound like heaven round: Or on rich clouds our spirits swim The summer twilight cool and dim. I only seeâthat thou art near; I only feelâI have thee dear! I only hear thy beating heart, I only know we cannot part. A BALLAD OF THE OLD TIME. Sweet Night, drop down from thy starry bower Thy influence dewily mild; Softly bend over my love's tender flower, As a Mother bends over her child. Hush the hills in a deep, dark dream; To slumber stretch valley and lea; Fold over all thy purple and pall, And bring my Love to me. You white witching Moon, with your beautiful smile; You flowers that fondle his feet; You weird wee Women of fairyland, wile Not my Love with your kisses sweet. For him my bower in the old gray tower Is dighted and dainty to see: All gentle Powers that walk the night-hours, Hasten my Love to me. I count my love's rosary over again, With its feelings and fancies and fears; Till it breaks in my brain with the tension of pain, And my pearls are but trembling tears! I sorrow and sing with the thorn at my breast; Mine eyes watch unweariedly: Come crown them, and calm them, and kiss them to rest; Dear my Love, hasten to me. The ripe swelling buds that are quickened with spring, Will peep from their silken fold; And my broidered belt is too short to cling Round my waist with its girdling gold. But my Love he will bring the plain gold ring; Base-born his Babe shall not be! Leal is his love as the heaven above: He never will lightly me. My Love he hath little of silver or gold; Of land he hath never a sod; But my Love is a gay gallant gentlemanâ He's a king by the grace of God. He has borne up the battle-tide broadsword in hand! He is comely as any ladye! O and were I a King's daughter, None other should marry me. My Love shall not wait at the Castle-gate, My Love shall not tirl at the pin; My Love he will climb to my bower-window; Sing O, but my Love shall come in. The dragon below lieth weary and old, Sleeping all under the tree; While I feast my Love on the apples of goldâ But soft! He is coming to me. IN THE NIGHT. Earth like a Lady poor and low Adores Night's kingly beauty now, While I, on fire in breast and brow, Awake to weep for thee, Love! The distant glories of the night, The Moon that walks in soft white light, These cannot win my charmÃ¨d sight, Nor lure a thought from thee, Love. I'm thinking of the short sweet hour Our fond hearts felt Love's growth of power, And summered as in Eden's bower When I was blest with thee, Love! There burned no beauty on the trees, There woke no song of birds or bees, But Love's cup for us held no lees, And I was blest with thee, Love. Then many-coloured fancies spring From out my heart on splendid wing, Like Chrysalis from Life's wintering, Burst bright and summeringly, Love! And as a Chief of battle lost Counts, and recounts his stricken host, Stands tearful Memory making most Of all that's touched with thee, Love. Perhaps in Pleasure's brilliant bower Thy heart may half forget Love's power, But at this still and starry hour Does it not turn to me, Love? O, by all pangs for thy sweet sake, In my deep love thy heart-thirst slake, Or, all-too-full, my heart must break: Break! break! with loving thee, Love! FALLEN. As the White Snow crowns the Hills, and the arms of Ether fills, With the lustre of its lovelinessâa presence as of light, And it looks up in Heaven's face with all a Virgin's trusting grace: So the Maiden walked on Purity's white height. But the Snow will blush for bliss, at the red Dawn's fervent kiss; And fall from its high throne, and lose the brightness from its brow; And be trodden on the highways, and be trampled in the by-ways: So the Maiden's life is stained and trampled now. DESERTED. Love came to me in a golden cloud, With a rosy glory kissed; And caught me up, and in heaven we rode, Till it melted in mournful mist. Gone! gone! is the light that shone, With the dream of my earlier day: And the wild winds moan; alone! alone! I wander my weary way. The days come and go, and the seasons roll,â In their glory they pass me by; And the lords of life and the happy in soul Walk under a smiling sky. And the sweet spring-tide comes back to us o'er The soothÃ¨d winter sea; But He will return no more, no more, Never come back to me. It were better that I lay sleeping With his baby upon my breast, Where the weary have done with their weeping, And the wretched are rocked to their rest. The world is a desolate, dreary one, Full of sad tears at best: God, take back Thy wandering weary one, Like a wounded bird home to its nest. DROWNED. 'Tis Midnight hour and the Dead have power Over the Wronger now! He is tortured and torn till the coming of morn; Pierced to the heart with the Crown of thorn That he set on the Suicide's brow. Wind him around in the toil of your charms; Nestle him close, young Bride! At the Midnight hour he is drawn from your arms; Through the dark with the Dead he must ride! Spirit from body is consciously drawn; Death comes not to kindly unsheathe; And the closer you cling the more anguish you wring From the form you so fondly enwreathe! The rose of her mouth is red-wet, red-warm, She smiles in her haven of calm! Troubled and tossed and lashed by the Lost, Slumber for him hath no balm! Again that ghostly groping along The Corridor of Dreams! And a dark Desolation luridly lit Is his face by Lightning gleams! Love's cup flushes up for his crowning kiss, But, with his lip at the brim, The Dead uncurtain his bower of bliss, Stretching their arms for him! Wind him around in the toil of your charms; Nestle him close, young Bride! Yet, at Midnight hour he is torn from your arms; Through the dark with the Dead he must ride: And the Dark, ah, the Dark! hath a million Eyes, All of his secret tell! And whispering winds pursue him like fiends That hiss in his ears of Hell! Warm in her bed the young Bride lies, Breathing her peaceful breath: Dead Mother and Babe with their drownÃ¨d eyes Stare dim through the watery death. 'Tis Midnight hour and the Dead have power Over the Wronger now! He is tortured and torn till the coming of morn; Pierced to the heart with the Crown of thorn That he set on the Suicide's brow. JILTED. Well! Friend! this arrow hath missed its mark, But, Man! you have more in your quiver. All over no doubt with your Pleasure-bark, But swim like a lusty liver! A-top of some Ararat next the skies You shall clap your wings and crow; Higher and higher your spirits will rise While the Deluge is ebbing below. Thank God some First Loves do miscarry, Men frequently say when they come to marry. Very likely she had some love for you! Some love till death doth sever: And some for a Month or a Year or two, And some they say for ever. Your love would have lasted, no doubt, my brother, That at least was eternal: We all think so, one time or other, While very young and vernal. But you might not have found your heaven within The pretty blue eyes you so wanted to win. The Learned will tell you those beautiful eyes Of witching, bewildering blue, Are as drumlie waters, or earth-made skies, Or un-rinsed linen in hue! For want of clearness their charm is given, And hearts are whirled away; Blue is not the Natural colour of heaven Where dwelleth the perfect day,â And the woman you thought you were loving, looked through Far other eyes than you worshipped, at you! Yes, I know how you stood all a-flame for her, Your heart of hearts to fill; I know how you hardly dared to stir Lest your delight should spill; Then came the clap on the back, my Friend, That made the dreamer start, And, at the awakening whack, my Friend Found he had lost his heart. Pass on, nor loiter with longing eye, 'Tis no use looking, unable to buy. You say that she gave you kiss for kiss; But that is no promise of marriage. Surely you know in a world like this A Lady must ride in her carriage? Although, like a lane I saw last spring, The way of her life should go,â One side with violets blossoming, The other white-wintry with snow. Of saffron the Greek wedding-robe was of old, Parents in England prefer it in gold. The old love wasn't the true love; That you have plainly proved. Be turning your thoughts to a new love, Somebody waits to be loved; Somebody patiently waiting for you, And the purified love you can give her, With a soul full of love as the summer dew Is of sun with its kiss all a-quiver. To keep the ghost from your vacant chair, Nothing like nestling a warm wife there. Do not be wasting the rest of your wine By pouring it out in the dust. What of your faith, old comrade of mine, Can you take your trial on trust? The knife is sharp and the flesh must shrink, But, as in the mythical day, God often perfects the Manhood I think By cutting the Woman away. He takes but a Spare-rib and gives you a Wife, With a heart beating warm in her, life of your life. LOVE AND THE LADY. 'Twere vain to ask that one so cold should give The vital warmth of heart that makes Love live; But in thy bosom leave a little room For Love to die in; marble for a Tomb! To be imparadised he doth but crave That she who was his death may be his grave: The monumental mockery of a Wife, For ever hard and cold and like to life: Thus, when the winged Divinity hath flown, We prize the old Greek statue of Love in stone. ICHABOD. Seven Summers' Suns have set! the world is once more sweetly flooded With fragrance, for the virgin-leaves and violet-banks have budded: Heaven claspeth Earth, as round the heart first broodeth Love's rich glow; A blush of Flowers is mantling where the lush green grasses grow! All things feel summering sunward, golden tides stream down the air, Which burns, as Angel-visitants had left a glory there! But darkness on my aching spirit shrouds the merry shine,â I long to feel a gush of Spring in this poor heart of mine. Morn opes Heaven's secret portal, back the pearly gates are drawn, And all the fields of glory blossom with the crimson Dawn: But never comes thy clasping hand, or carol of thy lips, That made my heart soar like a spirit freed from Death's eclipse. Sweet voice! it came like magic music, healing angels make, When pain sat heavy on my brow, and heart was like to break: Methought such love gave wings to climb some starry throne to win; Thou didst so lift up earth's horizonâletting heaven in. I'm thinking, Darling, of the days when life was all divine, And love was aye the silver cord that bound my heart to thine; When life bloomed at thy coming, as the green earth greets the sun, And, like two dew-drops in a kiss, our twin souls wed in one. Ah! still I feel ye at my heart! and 'mid the stir and strife, Ye sometimes lead my feet to walk the angel-side of Life: The magic music yearns within, as unto thee I turn, And those dear eyes, a-blaze with soul, through all my being burn. Come back,âcome back; I long to clasp thee in these arms, mine own; Lavish my heart upon thy lips, and make my love the Crown And Arc of Triumph to thy life. Why tarry? Time hath cast Strange shadows on my spirit since we met and mingled last! Yet there be joys to crown thee with; the sunshine and the sweet Are hived, like honey, in my heart, to share them should we meet: How I have hoarded up my life! how tenderly I strove To make my heart fit home for thee, its nestling Bird of love! God bless thee! once the radiant world thy beauty crownlike wore, But life hath lost the strange sweet feel that cometh never more! The flowers will bud again in spring, and happy birds make love, With melting hearts, a-brooding o'er their passion in the grove. But thou wilt never more come back, to clothe my heart with spring; Dear God! Love's sweetest chord is turned to Pain's most jarring string! The Glory hath departed! and my spirit pants to go Where, 'mid Life's troubled waters, 'twill not see the wreck below. A VILLAGE COURTING. O shy and simple Village Girl, With daisy-drooping eyes; Like light asleep within the pearl, Love in your young life lies. A hundred times in meadow and lane With careless hearts we walked; But we shall never meet again, And talk as we have talked. All in a moment life was crossed, In a fairy spell I'm bound; Yet fear to tell you what I've lost, Or know what I have found. When last I met you, tearful-meek The emerald gloaming came; Some veil fell from you, in your cheek The live rose was aflame! So distant and so dear you grew, More near, yet more estranged, And at your parting touch I knew That all the world was changed. All in a moment life was crossed, In a fairy spell I'm bound; Yet fear to tell you what I've lost, Or know what I have found. Your fairness haunts me all night long, I walk in a dream by day; My silent heart breaks into song, And the prayerless kneels to pray. Ten times a day the hot tears start, For very pride of you: Would God you were safe at home in my heart, To rest the rough world through. All in a moment life was crossed, In a fairy spell I'm bound; Yet fear to tell you what I've lost, Or know what I have found. My heart! She comes by lane and stile, With glances shy and sweet; Making the sunlight with her smile, And music with her feet. Ah! could I clasp her in mine arm Until she named the hour When life should move from charm to charm, And love from flower to flower! All in a moment life was crossed, In a fairy spell I'm bound; Yet fear to tell her what I've lost, Or know what I have found. ON A WEDDING-DAY. Thus, hand in hand, and heart in heart, Face nestling unto face, Forgotten things like Spirits start From many a hiding-place! There is no sound of Babe or Bird, And all the stillness seems Sweet as the music only heard Adown the land of dreams. And if, because it is so proud, My heart will find a voice, And in its dear dream love aloud, And speak of sweet still joys, It is no genuine gift of God, But only Goblin Gold, That withers into dead leaves, should The secret tale be told. Nine years ago you came to me, And nestled on my breast, A soft and wingÃ¨d mystery That settled here to rest; And my heart rocked its Babe of bliss, And soothed its child of air, With something 'twixt a song and kiss, To keep it nestling there. At first I thought the fairy form Too spirit-soft and good To fill my poor, low nest with warm And wifely womanhood. But such a cozy peep of home Did your dear eyes unfold; And in their deep and dewy gloom What tales of love were told! In dreamy curves your beauty drooped, As tendrils lean to twine, And very graciously they stooped To bear their fruit, my Vine! To bear such blessed fruit of love As tenderly increased Among the ripe vine-branches of Your balmy-breathing breast. We cannot boast to have bickered not Since you and I were wed; We have not lived the smoothest lot, Nor made the downiest bed! Time has not passed o'erhead in Stars, And underfoot in flowers, With wings that slept on fragrant airs Through all the happy hours. It is our way, more fate than fault, Love's cloudy fire to clear, To find some virtue in the salt That sparkles in a tear! Pray God it all come right at last, Pray God it so befall, That when our day of life is past The end may crown it all. Ah, Dear! though lives may pull apart Down to the roots of love, One thought will bend us heart to heart, Till lips re-wed above! One thought the knees of pride will bow Down to the grave-yard sod; You are the Mother of Angels now! We have two babes with God. Cling closer, closer, for their loss, About our darlings left, And let their memories grow like moss That healeth rent and rift;â For his dear sake, our Soldier Boy, For whom we nightly plead That he may live for God, and die For England in her need,â For her, who like a dancing boat Leaps o'er life's solemn waves, Our little Lightheart who can float And frolic over graves; And Grace, who making music goes, As in some shady place A Brooklet, prattling to the boughs, Looks up with its bright face. Cling closer, closer, life to life, Cling closer, heart to heart; The time will come; my own wed Wife, When you and I must part! Let nothing break our band but Death, For in the worlds above 'Tis the breaker Death that soldereth Our ring of Wedded Love. A LYRIC OF LOVE. The Bird that nestles nearest earth, To Heaven's gate nighest sings; And loving thee, my lowly life Doth mount on Lark-like wings! Thine eyes are starry promises: And affluent above All measure in its blessing, is The largess of thy love. Merry as laughter 'mong the hills, Spring dances at my heart! And at my wooing, Nature's soul Into her face will start! The Queen-moon, in her starry bower, Looks happier for our love; A dewier splendour fills the flower, And mellower coos the Dove. My heart may sometimes blind mine eyes With utterance of tears, But feels no pang for thee, Beloved! But all the more endears: And if life comes with cross and care Unknown in years of yore, Lest thou shouldst half the burthen bear, I shall be strong once more. Ah! now I see my life was shorn, That, like the forest-brook When leaves are shed, my darkling soul Up in heaven's face might look! And blessings on the storm that gave Me haven on thy breast, Where life hath climaxed like a wave That breaks in perfect rest. AT EVENTIDE. I sit beneath my shadowing Palm, All in the green o' the day at rest: And pictured in a sea of calm, The Past arises in my breast. The winter world takes leafy wing In that sweet April-tide of ours; And hidden Love lies listening, Where nodding smile the bridal flowers. I sing, and shut mine eyes and dream I hear her singing, my young Bride! Who on a-sudden from Life's stream Rose Swan-like swimming at my side. God love her! she was very fair, And in her eyes, to light my way, The Love-Star sprang and sparkled where The hidden Babe of Blessing lay. With healing as of summer showers That only nestle down to bless; And silent ministry of flowers, That only breathe their tenderness; She, softly as a starry scheme, My charmÃ¨d world hath circled round, Till life doth seem a pleasant dream The Victor dreameth sitting crowned. Gone is the sunshine from her hair, That made her beauty needless bright, To tint a many clouds of care, And cause the dark to smile with light. But so she lives that when the wind Of winter shreds the leaves, dear Wife! Seed ripe for Heaven Death may find On the poor withered stem of life. THE MISTLETOE BOUGH. 'Twas on a merry Christmas night, A many years ago, I saw my Love, with dancing sight, As she came over the snow. The Elvish Holly laughed above; A sweeter red below! When first I met with my true Love, Under the Mistletoe Bough. Bright-headed as the merry May-Dawn She floated down the dance; I thought some Angel must have gone Our human way by chance: I held my hands, and caught my bliss, Children, I'll show you how! And Earth touched Heaven in a kiss, Under the Mistletoe Bough. Ere leaves were green we built our nest, The March winds whistled wild; But in our love we were so blessed, Old Poverty he smiled. And Love the heart of Winter warmed, Love blossomed 'neath the snow; All fairy-land in blessings swarmed Under the Mistletoe Bough. The storms of years have beat our Bark, That rocks at anchor now; But She was smiling through the dark, My Angel at the prow. And brimming tides of love did bear Us over the rocks below! To-night, all safe in harbour here, Under the Mistletoe Bough. May you, Boys, win just such a Wife; Come drink the toast in wine! And you, Girls, may you light a life As she has brightened mine. Dear was the bonny Bride, and yet I'm prouder of her now Than on the merry, merry night we met, Under the Mistletoe Bough. LIFE AND DEATH. All night the Mother laboured long and sore; All night the Father lingered at Death's door And could not pass beyond; could not withdraw From his fast-fading eyes, until he saw Their coming little one; the Mother strove To give him this last pledge of visible love; But vainly strove to bring her babe to birth: And, at the last grave-edge of crumbling earth, Where life and death were locked in one last strain, His spirit clung with glazing gaze in vain: For when the Infant came, with smiling dawn, The waiting, watching, weary soul was gone: Even in Life's gateway Babe and Parent passed Each other, with Death's shadow overcast. WOMAN. My fellow-men, as yet we have but seen Wife, Sister, Mother and Daughter, not the Queen Upon her Throne, with all her jewels crowned! Unknowing how to seek, we have not found Our Goddess, waiting her Pygmalion To woo her into Woman from the stone! Our Husbandry hath lacked essential power To fructify the promise of the flower; We have not known her nature ripe all round. We have but seen her beauty on one side That leaned in love to us with blush of bride: The pure white Lily of all Womanhood With heart all-golden still is in the bud. We have but glimpsed a moment in her face The glory she will give the future race; The strong heroic spirit knit beyond All induration of the Diamond. She is the natural bringer from above; The Earthly mirror of Immortal Love; The chosen Mouthpiece for the Mystic Word Of Life Divine to speak through; and be heard With human Voice, that makes its Heavenward call Not in one Virgin Motherhood, but all. Unworthy of the gift how have Men trod Her pearls of pureness, Swine-like, in the sod! How often have they offered her the dust And ashes of the fanned-out fires of lust; Or, devilishly inflamed with the divine, Waxed drunken with the Sacramental wine. How have Men captured her with savage grips, To stamp the kiss of Conquest on her lips,â As feather in their crest have worn her grace, Or brush of fox that crowns the hunter's chase; Wooed her with Passions that but wed to fire With Hymen's Torch their own funereal pyre; Stripped her as Slave and Temptress of Desire; Embraced the body when her soul was far Beyond possession as the loftiest star! Her Whiteness hath been tarnished by their touch; Her Promise hath been broken in their clutch; The Woman hath reflected Man too much,â And made the Bread of Life with earthiest leaven. Our coming Queen must be the Bride of Heaven; The Wife who will not wear her bonds with pride As Adult Doll with fripperies glorified: The Mother fashioned on a nobler plan Than Woman who was merely made from Man. CRIES OF 'FORTY-EIGHT. CRIES OF 'FORTY-EIGHT. Let my Songs be cited As breakers of the peace, Till the Wrongs are righted; The man-made miseries cease: Till Earth's Disinherited Beg no more to earn their bread; Till the consuming darts of burning Day Shall fire the midnight Foxes; scare away From Labour's fruits the parasites of prey. Let them die when all is done, Now Victoriously begun! Our Visions have not come to nought, Who saw by Lightning in the night; The deeds we Dreamed are being Wrought By those who Work in clearer light; In other ways our fight is fought, And other forms fulfil our Thought Made visible to all men's sight. THE PEOPLE'S ADVENT. 'Tis coming up the steep of Time, And this old world is growing brighter! We may not see its Dawn sublime, Yet high hopes make the heart throb lighter! Our dust may slumber under-ground When it awakes the world in wonder; But we have felt it gathering round!â We have heard its voice of distant thunder! 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! 'Tis coming now, that glorious time Foretold by Seers and sung in story, For which, when thinking was a crime, Souls leaped to heaven from scaffolds gory! They passed. But lo! the work they have wrought, Now the crowned hopes of Centuries blossom! The lightning of their living thought Is flashing through us, brain and bosom: 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! Creeds, Empires, Systems, rot with age, But the great People's ever youthful! And it shall write the Future's page To our Humanity more truthful; The gnarliest heart hath tender chords To waken at the name of âBrother!â 'Tis coming when these scorpion-words We shall not speak to sting each other. 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! Out of the light, you Priests, nor fling Your dark, cold shadows on us longer! Aside, thou world-wide curse, called King! The people's step is quicker, stronger! There's a Divinity within That makes men great if they but will it; God works with all who dare to win, And the time cometh to reveal it. 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! Freedom! the Despots kill thy braves, Yet in our memories live the sleepers; And, though doomed millions feed the graves Dug by death's fierce, red-handed Reapers, The World will not forever bow To things that mock God's own endeavour. 'Tis nearer than they wot of now, When Flowers shall wreathe their Sword for ever! 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! Fraternity! Love's other name! Dear, heaven-connecting link of being; Then shall we grasp thy golden dream, As souls, full-statured, grow far-seeing: Thou shalt unfold our better part, And in our life-cup yield more honey; Light up with joy the Poor Man's heart, And Love's own world with smiles more sunny! 'Tis Coming! yes, 'tis Coming! Aye, it must come! The Tyrants throne Is crumbling, with our hot tears rusted; The Sword earth's mighty have leant on Is cankered, with our best blood crusted. Room for the men of Mind! Make way You Robber Rulers!âpause no longer! You cannot stay the opening day! The world rolls on, the light grows strongerâ The People's Advent's coming! THE BATTLE-CALL. You Serfs of England rouse ye from this dreaming! A spirit stirs that never more shall sleep; Look to the Future, lo! your Dayspring streaming With a new life that makes the Nations leap. The eyes of Rich and Poor flash wide with wonder! The Robbers tremble in their loftiest tower, Strange words roll o'er the world on wheels of thunder, The leaves from Royalty's tree fall hour by hour,â Earthquakes leap in the Temples, crumbling Throne and Power. Vampires have drained humanity's best blood, Kings robbed, and Priests have cursed us in God's name; Out in the midnight of the Past we stood, While these have darkly plied their devilish game. We have been worshipping the deadly Crown Which drew Heaven's laugh in Lightnings on our head; Chains fettered us who bowed abjectly down; We deemed our Gods divine; but lo! insteadâ They are but gilded clay,â'Tis morn! the glamour's fled! Call ye this âmerry England,ââonce the place Of souls self-deified and glory-crowned? Where smiles made sunshine in the Peasant's face, And Justice reignedâHer awful eyes closebound? Where Toil with open brow went on light-hearted, And twain in love Law never thrust apart? How is the glory of our life departed From us, who sit and nurse our bleeding smart; And slink, afraid to break the laws that break the heart! Hushed be the Herald on the walls of fame, Vaunting this People as their Country's pride; Weep rather, with your souls a-fire with shame: See ye not how the flattering knaves deride Us flattered fools? how priestcraft, strong and stealthy, Stabbing at freedom through its veil of night, Beguiles the poor to flush its coffers wealthy? Hear how the land groans in the grip of Might, Then quaff your cup of Wrongs, and laud a Briton's âRight.â There's not a spot in all this dear green land, Where Tyranny's cursed brand-mark is not seen: O! were it not for its all-blasting hand, A very heaven below this might have been! Has it not hunted forth our workers brave,â Killed the red rose of health that crowned our daughters, Wedded our living hopes unto the grave,â Filled happy homes with strife, the world with slaughters, And turned our thoughts to bloodâto gall, the heart's sweet waters? Where is the spirit of our stalwart Sires, Who rose and wrung their Rights from Tyrannies olden? Great Spirits have been here, for Freedom's fires Live in their ashes, to earth's heart enfolden; The mighty Dead lie slumbering around,â Whose names thrill through us as Gods were in the air; Life leaps from where their dust makes holy ground: Their deeds spring forth in glory,âlive all-where,â But we are Traitors to the Trust they bade us bear. Go forth, when Night is hushed, and heaven is clothÃ¨d With stars that in God's presence smiling roll; Feel the stirred spirit leap as 'twere betrothÃ¨d To some eternal bridegroom of the soul; Feel the hot tears start in the eyes upturning, The tide of goodness heave its brightest waves,â Then suddenly crush the grand and God-ward yearning With the sad thought that ye are bounden Slaves! O! how long will ye make your hearts its living graves? Immortal Liberty! we see thee stand Like Morn just stepped from heaven upon a mountain With beautiful feet, and blessing-laden hand, And heart that welleth Love's most living fountain! O! when wilt thou draw from the People's lyre Joy's broken chord? and on the People's brow Set Empire's crown? light up thy Altar-fire Within their hearts, with an undying glow; Nor give us blood for milk, as men are drunk with now? Old Legends tell us of a Golden Age, When earth was guiltless,âGods the guests of men, Ere sin had dimmed the heart's illumined page,â And prophet-voices say 'twill come again. O! happy age! when Love shall rule the heart, And time to live shall be the poor man's dower, When Martyrs bleed no more, nor Exiles smart,â Mind is the only diadem of power.â People, it ripens now! awake! and strike the hour. Hearts, high and mighty, gather in our cause; Bless, bless, O God, and crown their earnest labour, Who dauntless fight to win us Equal Laws, With mental armour, and with spirit-sabre! Bless, bless, O God! the proud intelligence, That now is dawning on the People's forehead,â Humanity springs from them like incense, The Future bursts upon them, boundlessâstarriedâ They weep repentant tears, that they so long have tarried. THE EARTH FOR ALL. Thus saith the Lord: You weary me With prayers, and waste your own short years: Eternal Truth you cannot see Who weep, and shed your sight in tears! In vain you wait and watch the skies, No better fortune thus will fall; Up from your knees I bid you rise, And claim the Earth for All. They ate up Earth, and promised you The Heaven of an empty shell! 'Twas theirs to say; 'twas yours to do, On pain of everlasting Hell! They rob and leave you helplessly For help of Heaven to cry and call: Heaven did not make your misery; The Earth was given for All! Behold in bonds your Mother Earth; The rich man's prostitute and slave! Your Mother Earth, that gave you birth, You only own her for a grave! And will you die like Slaves, and see Your Mother left a fettered thrall? Nay! live like Men and set her free As Heritage for All! THE LORDS OF LAND AND MONEY. Lift up your faces from the sod; Frown with each furrowed brow; Gold apes a mightier power than God, And wealth is worshipped now! In all these toil-ennobled lands You have no heritage; They snatch the fruit of Youthful hands, The staff from weary Age. O tell them in their Palaces, These Lords of Land and Moneyâ They shall not kill the Poor like Bees, To rob them of Life's honey. Through long dark years of blood and tears, We've toiled like branded Slaves, Till Wrong's red hand hath made a land Of Paupers, Prisons, Graves! But our long-sufferance endeth now; Within the souls of men The fruitful buds of promise blow, And Freedom lives again! O tell them in their Palaces, These Lords of Land and Money! They shall not kill the Poor like Bees, To rob them of Life's honey. Too long have Labour's Nobles knelt Before factitious âRankâ; Within our souls the iron is feltâ In tune our fetters clank! A glorious voice goes throbbing forth From millions stirring now, Who yet before these Gods of earth Shall stand with lifted brow, And tell them in their Palaces, These Lords of Land and Money! They shall not kill the Poor like Bees, To rob them of Life's honey. THE AWAKENING. How sweet is the fair face of Nature when May With her rainbow earth-born and flower-woven hath spanned Hill and dale; and the music of birds on the spray Makes Earth seem a beautiful faÃ«ry land! And dear is our First-love's young spirit-wed Bride, With her meek eyes just sheathing in tender eclipse, When the sound of our voice calls her heart's ruddy tide Up in beauty to break on her cheek and her lips. But Earth has no sight half so glorious to see, As a People up-girding its might to be free. To see men awake from the slumber of ages, Their brows grim from labour, their hands hard and tan, Start up living Heroes, long dreamt-of by Sages! And smite with strong arm the Oppressors of man: To see them come dauntless forth 'mid the world's warring, Slaves of the midnight-mine! Serfs of the sod! Show how the Eternal within them is stirring, And never more bend to a crownÃ¨d clod: Dear God! 'tis a sight for Immortals to see,â A People up-girding its might to be free. Battle on bravely, O sons of Humanity! Dash down the Cup from your lips, O ye Toilers! Too long hath the world bled for Tyrants' insanityâ Too long our weakness been strength to our Spoilers! The heart that through danger and death will be dutiful; Soul that with Cranmer in fire would shake hands, And a life like a Palace-home built for the beautiful, Freedom of all her belovÃ¨d demandsâ And Earth has no sight half so glorious to see, As a People up-girding its might to be free! âALL'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD.â The brow of Morning smiles with her one star; Lush-leafy Woods break into singing; Earth From dewy dark rolls round her balmy side, The floods of Dawn flow into a sea of day, And all goes right and merrily with the World. Spring with a tender beauty clothes the earth, And makes her happy as the Bride of Heaven, As though she knew no sorrowâheld no grave: No glory dims for all the hearts that break; And all goes right and merrily with the World. Birds sing as sweetly in the bowers of Spring; Suns mount as regally their sapphire throne; Stars set the gloom aglow, and harvests yield, As though man nestled in the lap of Love; All, all goes right and merrily with the World. But slip your dainty mask aside and see Hell open fathomless at your very feet! The Poor are murdered body and soul; the Rich In Pleasure's Goblet melt their pearl of life; Ay, all goes right and merrily with the World. Lean out into the looming Future, list The battle roll across the night to come! âSee how we right our Wrongs at last,â Revenge Writes with red radiance on the midnight heaven: Yet all goes right and merrily with the world. So Sodom, grim old Reveller! danced to her death. Voluptuous Music throbb'd through all her Courts; Mirth wantoned at her heart, one pulse before The tongues of Fire told out her tale of wrongsâ And all went right and merrily with the World! A CRY OF THE UNEMPLOYED. 'Tis hard to be a wanderer through this bright world of ours, Beneath a sky of smiling blue, on fragrant paths of flowers, With music in the woods, as there were nought but pleasure known, Or Angels walked Earth's solitudes, and yet with want to groan: To see no beauty in the stars, nor in Earth's welcome smile, To wander cursed with misery! willing, but cannot toil. With burning sickness at my heart, I sink down famishÃ¨d: God of the Wretched, hear my prayer: I would that I were dead! Heaven droppeth down with manna still in many a golden shower, And feeds the leaves with fragrant breath, with silver dew the flower. Honey and fruit for Bee and Bird, with bloom laughs out the tree, And food for all God's happy things; but none gives food to me. Earth, wearing plenty for a crown, smiles on my aching eye, The purse-proud,âswathed in luxury,âdisdainful pass me by: I've willing hands, an eager heartâbut may not work for bread! God of the Wretched, hear my prayer: I would that I were dead! Gold, art thou not a blessÃ¨d thing, a charm above all other, To shut up hearts to Nature's cry, when brother pleads with brother? Hast thou a music sweeter than the voice of loving-kindness? No! curse thee, thou'rt a mist 'twixt God and men in outer blindness. âFather, come back!â my Children cry; their voices, once so sweet, Now pierce and quiver in my heart! I cannot, dare not meet The looks that make the brain go mad, for dear ones asking breadâ God of the Wretched, hear my prayer: I would that I were dead! Lord! what right have the poor to wed? Love's for the gilded great: Are they not formed of nobler clay, who dine off golden plate? 'Tis the worst curse of Poverty to have a feeling heart: Why can I not, with iron grasp, choke out the tender part? I cannot slave in yon Bastille! I think 'twere bitterer pain, To wear the Pauper's iron within, than drag the Convict's chain. I'd work but cannot, starve I may, but will not beg for bread: God of the Wretched, hear my prayer: I would that I were dead! MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE. Merry Christmas Eve in a Palace where knavery Crowded all treasures that Workers surrender; Where spirits grow rusted in silkenest slavery; Life is out-panted in sloth and in splendour: In gladness and glory Wealth's darlings were meeting, And jewel-clasped fingers linked softly again; New Friendships a-twining, and Old Friends a-greeting; No thought of God's creatures that crouch in their pain! Merry Christmas Eve in a Poor man's grim hovel, There huddled in silence a famishing family; Church-bells were chiming in musical revel, Through Night's mask a-mocking with merry anomaly. All in the happy time there they sat, mourningâ Two Sonsâtwo Brothersâin penal chains bleeding; Their hearts wandered forth to the never-returning, Who rose on their vision, pale, haggard, and pleading. Merry Christmas Eve! for the Rich there was music And dancing, and Wine on Wine woo'd on the board; O Falstaff! you prince of Lies! 'twould have made you sick, To hear how they flattered a Mammonite Lord! What matter, though hearts might be breaking without? Their moans did not reach them where rang roof and rafter With mirth that in face of the wretched will flout. Ay, laugh on, ye callous, in Hell there is laughter! Merry Christmas Eve! but the stricken ones heard No neighbourly welcome, no kind voice of kin; They looked at each other, but spake not a word, While through crevice, and cranny, the sleet drifted in. In a desolate corner, one, hunger-killed, lay, And the Mother's hot tears were a bosom-babe's food. What marvel, O Statesmen, what marvel, I pray, Such misery nurseth Crime's viperous brood? O men, Angel-imaged in Nature's fair mint, Is it for this, ye were fashioned divine? Ah, where's the God-stampâImmortality's print? We are Tyrants and Slaves, knit in one tortured twine: That a few, like to gods, may stride over the earth, Millions are murdered, or given in pawn; When will the world quicken for Liberty's birth, Which she waiteth, with eager wings beating the dawn? False Priests, dare ye say 'tis the will of your God, These things should be done 'neath His sheltering sky? That millions of Paupers should bow to the sod? Up, up, trampled hearts, it's a Lie! it's a Lie! They may carve âStateâ and âAltarâ in characters golden, But Tyranny's symbols are ceasing to win; Be stirring, O people, your Flag is unfolden, And brave be the battles you blazon therein. OUR FATHERS ARE PRAYING FOR PAUPER-PAY. Smitten stones will talk with fiery tongues, And the worm, when trodden, will turn; But, Cowards, ye cringe to the cruellest wrongs, And answer with never a spurn. Then torture, O Tyrants, the spiritless drove, Old England's Helots will bear: There's no hell in their hatred, no God in their love, No shame in their deepest despair. For our Fathers are praying for Pauper-pay, Our Mothers with Death's kiss are white; Our Sons are the rich man's Serfs by day, And our Daughters his Slaves by night. The Tearless are drunk with our tears: have they driven The God of the poor man mad? For we weary of waiting the help of Heaven, And the battle goes still with the bad. O but death for death, and life for life, It were better to take and give, With hand to throat, and with knife to knife, Than die out as thousands live! Our Fathers are praying for Pauper-pay, Our Mothers with Death's kiss are white; Our Sons are the rich man's Serfs by day, And our Daughters his Slaves by night. Fearless and few were the Heroes of old, Who played the peerless part: We are fifty-fold, but the gangrene Gold Is eating out England's heart. With their faces to danger, like Freemen they fought, With their daring, all heart and hand: And the thunder-deed followed the lightning-thought, When they stood for their own good land. Our Fathers are praying for Pauper-pay, Our Mothers with Death's kiss are white; Our Sons are the rich man's Serfs by day, And our Daughters his Slaves by night. When the heart of one half the world doth beat Akin to the brave and the true, And the tramp of Democracy's earth-quaking feet Goes thrilling the wide world through,â We should not be crouching in darkness and dust, And dying like slaves in the night; But big with the might of the inward âmust,â We should battle for Freedom and Right! Our Fathers are praying for the Pauper-pay, Our Mothers with Death's kiss are white; Our Sons are the rich man's Serfs by day, And our Daughters his Slaves by night. What do we lack, that the Ruffian Wrong Should starve us 'mid heaps of gold? We have brains as broad, we have arms as strong As our Captors, if only as bold! Will a thousand years more of meek suffering school Your lives to a sterner bravery? No! down and down with their Robber Rule, And up from the land of slavery! Our Fathers are praying for Pauper-pay, Our Mothers with Death's kiss are white; Our Sons are the rich man's Serfs by day, And our Daughters his Slaves by night. ANATHEMA MARANATHA. Deeper and deeper the Despot's lash flayeth, Swifter and swifter fierce Misery slayeth; Tighter and tighter the grip of Toil groweth, Nigher and nigher the dark Ruin floweth. And still ye bear on, and ye faint heart and breath, Till ye creep, scourgÃ¨d hounds, to your kennel of death: O down to the dust with ye, Cowards and Slaves, Plague-stricken Cumber-grounds, slink to your graves! Love is the Crown of all life, but ye wear it not; Freedom, Humanity's palm, and ye bear it not; Beauty spreads banquet for all, but ye share it not; Grimmer the blinding veil glooms, and ye tear it not. Weaving your life-flowers in Wealth's robe of glory, Ye stint in your starkness with youth smitten hoary! O down to the dust with ye, Cowards and Slaves, Plague-stricken Cumber-grounds, slink to your graves! They have broken your hearts for their hunger, and trod The wine-press for Death, with our fruitage of God; And ye lick their feet, red with your blood, like dumb cattle! Far better, far braver to meet them in battle! The bow that Tell drew hath lost none of its spring, Did ye nerve with your daring the arrow and string: O down to the dust with ye, Cowards and Slaves, Plague-stricken Cumber-grounds, slink to your graves! There's a curse on the Mammonites fiery and fell, Their hearts are as hard as the Millstones of Hell; And there's wringing of hands with the Knave and the Tyrant, For God's graven Autograph's on their death-warrant. The people arise face to face with their Foes: Up now! while before us the Fire-Pillar glows! Or down to the dust with ye, Cowards and Slaves, Down, down for ever, and rot in your graves! A CRY OF THE PEOPLE. Tossing in torture, the weary World turneth, To clutch Freedom's robe round her slavery's starkness: With shame and with shudder, poor Mother! she yearneth O'er wrongs that are done in her dearth and her darkness. O gather thy strength up, and crush the AbhorrÃ¨d, Who murder thy poor heart, and drain thy life-springs, And are crowned but to hide the Cain-brand on their forehead: Let these be the Last of the Queens and the Kings! By the Lovers and Friends we have tenderly cherished, Who made the Cause soar up like flame at their breath; Who struggled like Gods met in fight, or have perished In Poverty's battle, with grim daily death: By all the dear ones that bitterly plead for usâ Life-flowers tied up in the heart's breaking stringsâ Sisters that weep for usâMothers that bleed for usâ Let these be Last of the Queens and the Kings! Sun and Rain kindle greenly the graves of our Martyrs, Ye might not tell where the red blood ran like rain! But there it burns ever! and heaven's weeping waters And bleaching suns never can whiten the stain! Remember the hurtling the Tyrants have wrought us, And smite till each helm on head flashes and rings! Life for life, blood for blood, is the lesson they've taught us, And be these the Last of the Queens and the Kings! Ho! weary Night-watch, is there light on the summit? Sentinel through the dark, say, is there hope? For deeper in gloom than the fathom of plummet, Our Bark through the tempest doth stagger and grope! âTo God's Unforgiven, to Caitiff and Cravenâ To Crown and to Sceptre, a cleaving curse clings: Ye must fling them from deck, would ye steer into Haven, For Death tracks the Last of the Queens and the Kings!â PRESS ON. Press on, press on, ye Rulers, in the roused world's forward track: It moves too sure for you to put the dial of Freedom back! We're gathering up from near and far, with souls in fiery glow, And Right doth bare its arm of might to bring the Spoilers low. Kings, Priests, ye're far too costly, and we weary of your rule; We crown no more âDivinity,â where Nature writeth âFool!â Ye must not bar our glorious path as in the days agone; We know that God made Men, but men made Kings and PriestsâPress on! Press on, press on, ah! âNobles!â you have played a daring game; Now falls your star of luck, now fades the prestige of your name: Too long have you been fed and nursed on human blood and tears; The naked truth is known, and Labour leaps to life, and swears His pride of strength to bloated Ease he will no longer give: For all who live should labour, âLords,â then all who work might live! The combat comes! make much of what you've wrung from Fatherland! Press on, press on! To-day we plead, To-morrow we command. Press on! a million pauper-brows bend down in Misery's dust; God's champions of eternal Truth still eat the mouldy crust: This damning curse of Tyrants must not kill the nation's heart; The spirit in a million Slaves doth pant, on fire to start And strive to mend the world, and join the Nation's march sublime; While myriads sink heart-broken, and the land o'er-swarms with crime. âO God!â they cry, âwe die, we die, and see no earnest won!â Brothers, join hand and heart, and in the work press on, press on! THEY ARE BUT GIANTS WHILE WE KNEEL. Good People! put no faith in Kings, nor in your Princes trust, Who break your hearts for bread, and grind your faces in the dust: The Palace-Paupers look from lattice high, and mock your prayer: The Champions of the Christ are dumb, or golden bit they wear. O but to see ye bend no more to earth's crime-cursÃ¨d things: Be ye God's Oracles: stand forth, as Nature's Priests and Kings! Ye fight and bleed, while Fortune's darlings slink in splendid lair, With lives that crawl, like worms through buried Beauty's golden hair!â A tale of lives wrung out in tears their Grandeur's garb reveals, And the last sobs of breaking hearts sound in their Chariot-wheels! O league yeâcrush the things that kill all love and liberty! They are but Giants while we kneel: one leap, and up go We. Trust not the Priests, whose tears are lies, and hearts are hard and cold; Who lead ye to sweet pastures, where they fleece the foolish fold! The Church and State are linked and sworn to desolate the land: Good people, 'twixt these Foxes' tails, We'll fling a fiery brand. Up, if ye will be free, to Golden Calves no longer bow: The Nations yearn for Libertyâthe world grows earnest now. Your bent-knee is half-way to hell!âUp, Serviles, from the dust! The Harvest of the free red-ripens for the sickle-thrust. They're quaking now, and shaking now, who wrought the hurtling sorrow, To-day the Desolators, but the Desolate To-morrow! Loud o'er their murder's menace wakes the watch-word of the Free: They are but Giants while we kneel: one leap, and up go We! Some bravest patriot-hearts have gone, to break beyond the Sea, And many in the Dungeon have died for you and me! And still we glut the Mercilessâgive all Life's glory up, That stars of flame, and winking eyes, may crown their revel-cup. Back, tramplers on the Many! Death and Danger ambushed lie; Beware ye, or the blood may run! the patient people cry: âAh! shut not out the light of hope, or we may blindly dash, Like Samson with his strong death-grope, and whelm ye in the crash. Think how they spurred the People mad, that old RÃ©gime of France, Whose heads, like poppies, from Death's Scythe fell in a bloody dance.â Ye plead in vain, ye bleed in vain, O Blind! when will ye see They are but Giants while we kneel? One leap, and up go We. The merry flowers are springing from our last-year Martyrs' mould, As if their dreams had blossomed telling what they would have told, Of our unfettered Future: and what this earth shall be When we have bartered blows and bonds for life and liberty. Ah! what a face of glory shall the weary world put on, When Love is crownÃ¨d, and shall rule the heart, its royal throne! O we shall see our darlings smile,âwho meet us tearful now,â Ere the Eternal morn breaks gray, on the Beloved's brow: And pride, not shame, shall flush the face of our heart-nestling Dove, And Love shall give the kiss of Death no more to those we love. Wake, Titans, scale th' Olympus where the hindering Tyrants be: They are but Giants while we kneel: one leap, and up go We! SONG OF THE RED REPUBLICAN. Fling out the red Banner! its fiery front under, Come, gather ye, gather ye, Champions of Right! And roll round the world, with the voice of God's thunder, The Wrongs we've to reckon, Oppressions to smite. They deem that we strike no more like the old Hero-band, Victory's own battle-hearted and brave: Once more brothers mine, it were sweet but to see ye stand, Triumph or Tomb welcome, Glory or Grave! Fling out the red Banner! in mountain and valley Let Earth feel the tread of the Free once again; Now soldiers of Liberty make on more rally, Old Earth yearns to know that her children are Men. We are nerved by a thousand wrongs, burning and bleeding; Bold Thoughts leap to birth, but the bold Deeds must come; And wherever Humanity's yearning and pleading, One battle for Liberty strike we heart-home. Fling out the red Banner! achievements immortal Have yet to be won by the hands labour-brown; Though few of us enter the proud promise-portal, Yet wear it in thought like a glorious Crown! O joy of the onset! sound trumpet! array us; True hearts would leap up were all hell in our path; Up, up from the Slave-land; who stirreth to stay us, Shall fall, as of old, in a Red Sea of wrath. Fling out the red Banner, O Sons of the morning! Young spirits awaiting to burst into wings,â We stand shadow-crowned, but sublime is the warning, All heaven's grimly hushed, and the Bird of Storm sings! âAll's well,â saith the Sentry on Tyranny's tower, While Hope by his watch-fire is gray and tear-blind; Ay all's well! Freedom's Altar burns, hour by hour, Live brands for the fire-damp with which ye are mined. Fling out the red Banner! the Patriots perish, But where their bones whiten the seed striketh root: Their blood hath run red the great harvest to cherish: Now gather ye, Reapers, and garner the fruit. Victory! victory! Tyrants are quaking! The Titan of Toil from the bloody thrall starts; The Slaves are awaking, the dawn-light is breaking, The foot-fall of Freedom beats quick at our hearts! AFTER THE STRUGGLE. Like leaves from Autumn's bough, Old Friend, Our ripest hopes depart; There's little left us now, Old Friend, To cheer the Patriot's heart. The Altars where we knelt, Old Friend, Grow desolate and cold; The faith is faint they felt, Old Friend, In valiant days of old. In bloody shrouds they sleep, Old Friend, Who could not live as slaves: The living only weep, Old Friend, Above their Martyrs' graves! Freedom hath many a wound, Old Friend, And, ringed by hounds of hell, She wraps her purple round, Old Friend, To fall as CÃ¦sar fell. The men of blood prevail, Old Friend, And, stricken in the night, The people's weeping wail, Old Friend, Goes praying for the light. And yet their day shall come, Old Friend, Though we may never hear The shouts of Harvest-home, Old Friend, Nor see the golden year. OUR MARTYRS. They are gone! When Hope's blossoms, many-numbered, Into flower burst; When on earthquake-edge they slumbered, Who have Man accursed; When our hearts, like throbbing drums, Beat for Freedom; sang âShe comes!â There they stumbled 'mong the tombs. They are gone! Freedom's strong ones, young and hoary, Beautiful in faith! And her first dawn-blush of glory Gilds their camp of death! There they lie in shrouds of blood; Murdered, where for Right they stoodâ Martyrs murdered doing good. They are gone! Yet 'tis well to die up-giving Valour's vengeful breath, To make Heroes of the living,â Thus divine is death. One by one, true hearts! you left us! Yet Hope hath not all bereft us: Still we man the gap you cleft us! They are here! In the silent tears that start Thinking of their loss; In the Ãtna of each heart, Where flames of Vengeance toss! They are with us, they are here, Smiling in the flash o' the tear, Happy when we know they are near! They are here! Here, where life ran ruddy rain, When power from God seemed wrenched; Here, where tears fellâmolten brain! And hands were agony-clenched! Lift the veil and look! Ah! now There's a glory, where the glow Of their fire-crown seamed each brow. They are here! With us in the march of time; With us side by side! Let us live their lives sublime, Die as they have died! Wait: these Martyrs yet shall come, Myriad-fold from out their tomb! In the Despots' day of doom. THE MEN OF 'FORTY-EIGHT. They rose in Freedom's rare sunrise, Like Giants roused from wine; And in their hearts and in their eyes The God leaped up divine! Their souls flashed out, naked as swords Unsheathed for fiery fate! Strength went like battle with their wordsâ The men of 'Forty-eight. Hurrah! For the men of 'Forty-eight. The Kings have got their Crown again, And blood-red revel cup; They've bound the Titan down again, And heaped his grave-mound up! But still he lives, though buried 'neath The mountain,âlies in wait, Heart-stifled heaves and tries to breathe The breath of 'Forty-eight. Hurrah! For the men of 'Forty-eight. Dark days have fallen, yet in the strife We bate no hope sublime, And bravely works the exultant life, Their hearts pulsed through the time: As grass is greenest trodden down, Their suffering makes men great, And this dark tide shall richly crown The work of 'Forty-Eight. Hurrah! For the men of 'Forty-eight. Some in a bloody burial sleep, Like Greeks to glory gone, But in their steps avengers leap With their proof-armour on: And hearts beat high with dauntless trust To triumph soon or late, Though they be mouldering down in dustâ The Men of 'Forty-eight! Hurrah! For the Men of 'Forty-eight. O when the World wakes up to worst The Tyrants once again, And Freedom's summons-shout shall burst, Rare music! on the brain,â Old Truehearts still, in many a land, Ye'll find them all elateâ Brave remnant of that Spartan-band, The Men of 'Forty-eight. Hurrah! For the Men of 'Forty-eight. A WELCOME. Ho! Patriots of Old England, wake! And join ye heart and hand, To welcome him for Freedom's sake To our dear Fatherland! He needs no proud Triumphal Arch, Nor Banners on the wind: In hearts that beat his triumph-march, Kossuth is fitly shrined! We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. He rose like Freedom's Morning star, Where all was darkling, dim; We saw his glory from afar, And fought in soul for him! Brave Victor! how his radiant brow Kinged Freedom's host like Saul! And in his Crown of Sorrow now He's royallest heart of all. We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. Ay, English hearts through proud tears gush With glory at his name, Whose brave deeds made the roused blood rush Along our veins like flame: We cheered him through his hero-strife And, in his presence met, Will show the world that patriot life Lives in Old England yet! We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. He cometh dim with glorious dust, From out his wrestling-ring: But, blessingsâpraisesâdeathless trustâ Like armies round him cling! His Hungary billows o'er with graves Of Martyrs not in vain; A rising ripening harvest waves Its fruit of that red rain! We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. Freedom will run her radiant round, Though clouds shut out the sky; O may his country's heart yet bound To Kossuth's conquering cry; And once again the Hapsburgh Star His flaming Sword make dim; And palsy strike the arm that dare Not strike a blow for him! We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. Ring out, exult, and clap your hands, Free Men and Women brave; Shout, Britain! shake the startled lands, And free the bounden Slave! Come forth, make merry in the sun, And give him welcome due; Heroic deeds have crowned him one Of Earth's Immortal few! We meet him here, we greet him hereâ With Love's wide arms caress him! Kings would have no such welcome cheer, As Kossuth hath: God bless him. THE EXILE. Ay, Tyrants, build your Babels! forge your fetters! link your chains! As brims your guilt-cup fuller, ours of grief ebbs to the drains; Still, on the Cross, your crowns of thorn for Freedom's Martyrs twine; Still batten on live hearts and madden o'er the hot blood-wine. Murder men sleeping, or awake torture them dumb with pain, And tear, with hands all bloody red, the vesture of the slain! Your feet are on us, Tyrantsâstrike! and hush Earth's wail of sorrow: Your sword of power, so red to-day, shall kiss the dust to-morrow. O! but 'twill be a merry day the world shall set apart, When Strife's last brand is broken in the last crowned Despot's heart! And it shall come,âdespite of Rifle, Rope, and Rack, and Scaffold, Once more we lift undaunted brows, and battle on unbaffled. Our hopes ran mountains high, we sang at heart, wept tears of gladness, When France, the bravely beautiful, dashed down her sceptred madness; And Hungary her one-hearted race of mighty heroes hurled In the death-gap of nations, as a bulwark for the world. O Hungary! gallant Hungary! very glorious wert thou, That rose up with the beauty of the morning on thy brow. And Rome,âwho, while her heroes bled, felt her old breast heave higher,â How her eyes reddened with the flash of all their Roman fire! Mothers of Children, who shall live the Gods of future story, Your blood shall blossom from the dust, and crown the world with glory. Ye'll tread them down yet, Curse and Crown! uplift the trodden Slave, And Freedom shall be sovran in the courts of Fool and Knave. Wail for the hopes that have gone down! the life so freely spilt! Th' Eternal Murder still sits throned and crowned in damning guilt: Still in God's golden sun the Tyrant's bloody banners burn, The Priests,âHell's midnight Thugs!âto their soul-strangling work return! See how the Oppressors of the Poor with serpents hunt their blood; Hear, from the dark, the groan and curse go maddening up to God. They kill and trample us poor worms, till earth is dead men's dust; Death's red tooth daily drains our hearts, but end, ay, end it must. The herald of deliverance leaps in the womb of Time; The Poor's grand army treads the Age's march with step sublime. Ours is the mighty future! and what marvel, brother men, Should the devoured of ages rise and turn devourers then? O! brothers of the horny hand see through your tears and smile, The World is rife with sound of fetters snapping 'neath the file; I lay my hand on England's heart, and in each life-throb mark, The pealing thought of freedom ring its Tocsin in the dark. I see the Toiler hath become another Gospel's Preacher, And, as he wins a crust, stands proudly forth, the true world-teacher; He still toils on, but, Tyrants, 'tis a mighty thing when Slaves, Who delve their lives into their work, know that they dig your graves! Anarchs! your doom comes swiftly! brave and eager spirits climb, To ring Oppression's death-knell from the old watch-towers of time; A spirit of resistless might is stirring at this hour, And thought is burning in men's eyes with more than speechful power. Old England cease the mummer's part! wake, Starveling, Serf, and Slave! Rouse in the majesty of wrong, as kindred of the brave! Speak, and the world shall answer, with her voices myriad-fold, And men, like Gods, shall grapple with the giant-wrongs of old. Now, Mothers of the people, give your babes heroic milk; Sires, soul your sons for daring deeds, no more soft thews of silk; Great spirits of the mighty dead take shape, and walk our mind, Their glory smites our upward look, we seem no longer blind; They tell us how they broke their bonds, and whisper, âSo may ye:â One sharp, stern struggle, and the Slaves of centuries are free! The people's heart, with pulse like cannon, panteth for the fray, And Brothers, dead or living, we'll be with you in that day. IT WILL END IN THE RIGHT. Never despair! O, my Comrades in sorrow! I know that our mourning is ended not. Yet, Shall the vanquished to-day be the Victors tomorrow, Our Star shall shine on in the Tyrant's Sunset. Hold on! though they spurn thee, for whom thou art living A life only cheered by the lamp of its love: Hold on! Freedom's hope to the bounden ones giving: Green spots in the waste wait the worn spirit-dove. Hold on,âstill hold on,âin the world's despite, Nurse the faith in thy heart, keep the lamp of Truth bright, And, my life for thine! it shall end in the Right. What, though the Martyrs and Prophets have perished! The Angel of Life rolls the stone from their graves: Immortal's the faith, and the freedom they cherished, Their lone Triumph-cry stirs the spirits of slaves! They are gone,âbut a Glory is left in our life, Like the day-god's last kiss on the darkness of Evenâ Gone down on the desolate seas of their strife, To climb as star-beacons up Liberty's heaven. Hold on,âstill hold on,âin the world's despite, Nurse the faith in thy heart, keep the lamp of Truth bright, And, my life for thine! it shall end in the Right. Think of the Wrongs that have ground us for ages, Think of the Wrongs we have still to endure! Think of our blood, red on History's pages; Then work, that our reck'ning be speedy and sure. Slaves cry to their Gods! but be our God revealed In our lives, in our works, in our warfare for man; And bearingâor borne uponâVictory's shield, Let us fight battle-harnessed, and fall in the van. Hold on,âstill hold on,âin the world's despite, Nurse the faith in thy heart, keep the lamp of Truth bright, And, my life for thine! it shall end in the Right. THE KINGLIEST KINGS. Ho! ye who in a noble work Win scorn, as flames draw air, And in the way where Lions lurk, God's image bravely bear; Though trouble-tried and torture-torn, The kingliest Kings are crowned with thorn. Life's glory, like the bow in heaven, Still springeth from the cloud; Soul ne'er out-soared the starry Seven, But Pain's fire-chariot rode: They've battled best who've boldliest borne; The kingliest Kings are crowned with thorn. The Martyr's fire-crown on the brow Doth into glory burn; And tears that from Love's torn heart flow, To pearls of spirit turn. Our dearest hopes in pangs are born; The kingliest Kings are crowned with thorn. As beauty in Death's cerement shrouds, And Stars bejewel Night, Bright thoughts are born in dim heart-clouds, And suffering worketh might. The mirkest hour is Mother o' Morn, The kingliest Kings are crowned with thorn. HOPE ON, HOPE EVER. Hope on, hope ever! though To-day be dark, The sweet sunburst may smile on thee Tomorrow: Though thou art lonely, there's an eye will mark Thy loneliness, and guerdon all thy sorrow! Though thou must toil 'mong cold and sordid men, With none to echo back thy thought, or love thee, Cheer up, poor heart! thou dost not beat in vain; While God is over all, and heaven above thee, Hope on, hope ever. The iron may enter in and pierce the soul, But cannot kill the love within thee burning: The tears of misery, thy bitter dole, Can never quench thy true heart's eager yearning For better things: nor crush thy ardour's trust, That Error from the mind shall be uprooted, That Truth shall flower from all this tear-dewed dust, And Love be cherished where Hate was embruted! Hope on, hope ever. I know 'tis hard to bear the sneer and taunt,â With the heart's honest pride at midnight wrestle; To feel the killing canker-worm of Want, While rich rogues in their mocking luxury nestle; For I have felt it. Yet from Earth's cold Real My soul looks out on coming things, and cheerful The warm Sunrise floods all the land Ideal, And still it whispers to the worn and tearful, Hope on, hope ever. Hope on, hope ever! after darkest night Comes, full of loving life, the laughing Morning; Hope on, hope ever! Spring-tide, flushed with light, Aye crowns old Winter with her rich adorning. Hope on, hope ever! yet the time shall come, When man to man shall be a friend and brother; And this old world shall be a happy home, And all Earth's family love one another! Hope on, hope ever. THE THREE VOICES. A wailing Voice comes up a desolate road, Drearily, drearily, drearily! Where mankind have trodden the By-way of blood, Wearily, wearily, wearily! Like a sound from the Dead Sea all shrouded in glooms With breaking of hearts, fetters clanking, men groaning, Or chorus of Ravens that croak among tombs, It comes with the mournfullest moaning: âWeep, weep, weep!â Yoke-fellows, listen, Till tearful eyes glisten: 'Tis the Voice of the Past: the dark, grim-featured Past, All sad as the shriek of the midnight blast: Weep, weep, weep, Tears to wash out the terrible stain, Where Humanity rotted That lands might be fatted, Or life ran a deluge of hot, ruddy rain: Weep, weep, weep. Another Voice comes from the millions that bend, Tearfully, tearfully, tearfully! From hearts which the scourges of Slavery rend, Fearfully, fearfully, fearfully! From many a worn, noble spirit that breaks, In the world's solemn shadows adown in Life's valleys, From Mine, Forge, and Loom, Mount and Valley it wakes, On the soul wherein Liberty rallies: âWork, work, work!â Yoke-fellows, listen: Till earnest eyes glisten: 'Tis the Voice of the Present. It bids us, my Brothers, Be Freemen: and then for the freedom of others Work, work, work! For the Many, a holocaust long to the Few: O work while ye may! O work while 'tis day! And cling to each other, united and true: Work, work, work. There cometh another Voice sweetest of all, Cheerily, cheerily, cheerily! And my heart leapeth up at its clarion-call, Merrily, merrily, merrrily! It comes like the touch of the Spring-tide, unwarping The frost of oppression that bound us: It comes like a choir of Celestials, harping Their gladsomest music around us: âHope, hope, hope!â Yoke-fellows, listen, Till gleeful eyes glisten: The Voice of the Future, the sweetest of all, Makes the heart leap to its clarion-call. Hope, hope, hope! Be of good cheer and step forth in the van, For Serfdom hath passed, And Labour at last Shall enter the Brotherhood common to Man: Hope, hope, hope! ONWARD AND SUNWARD. âTell me the song of the beautiful Stars, As grandly they glide on their blue way above us, Looking, despite of our spirit's sin-scars, Down on us here as if yearning to love us!â This is the song in their work-worship sung, All through the world-jewelled universe rung: âOnward for ever, for evermore onward,â And ever they open their loving eyes Sunward. âOnward,â shouts Earth, with her myriad voices Of music, aye answering the song of the Seven, As like a winged child of God's love she rejoices, Swinging her Censer of glory in heaven. And lo, it is writ by the finger of God, In sunbeams and flowers on the smiling green sod: âOnward for ever, for evermore onward,â And ever she turneth all trustfully Sunward. The mightiest souls of all time hover o'er us, Who laboured like Gods among men, and have gone With great bursts of sun on the dark way before us: They're with us, still with us, our battle fight on, Looking down victor-browed, from the glory-crowned hill, They beckon and beacon us on, onward still: And the true heart's aspirings are onward, still onward; It turns to the Future, as earth turneth Sunward. GOD'S WORLD IS WORTHY OF BETTER MEN. Behold! an idle tale they tell, But who shall blame their telling it? The rogues have got their cant to sell, The world pays well for selling it! They say our earth's a desert drear,â Still plagued with Egypt's blindness! That we were sent to suffer here,â And by a God of kindness! That since the world hath gone astray It must be so for ever, And we should stand still, and obey Its Desolators. Never! We'll labour for the better time, With all our might of Press and Pen; Believe me, 'tis a truth sublime, God's world is worthy of better men. 'Twas meant to be, since it began, A world of love and gladness: Its beauty may be marred by man With all his crime and madness, Yet 'tis a fair world still. Love brings A sunshine for the dreary; With all our strife, sweet Rest hath wings To fold about the weary. The Sun in glory, like a God, To-day in heaven is shining; The flowers on the jewelled sod Love-messages are twining, As radiant of immortal youth And beauty, as of old; ah! then Believe me 'tis eternal truth, God's world is worthy of better men. O! they are bold, knaves over-bold, Who say we are doomed to anguish: That men in God's own image souled, Like hell-bound slaves must languish. Probe Nature's heart to its red core, There's more of good than evil; And man, down-trampled man, is more Of Angel than of Devil. Prepare to die? Prepare to live! We know not what is living: And let us for the world's good give, As God is ever giving. Give Action, Thought, Love, Wealth, and Time; Work hand and brain, wield Press and Pen: Believe me, 'tis a truth sublime, God's world is worthy of better men. THIS WORLD IS FULL OF BEAUTY. There lives a Voice within me, a guest-angel of my heart, And its bird-like warbles win me, till the tears a-tremble start; Up evermore it springeth, like some magic melody, And evermore it singeth this sweet song of songs to meâ âThis world is full of beauty, as other worlds above. And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love.â Morn's budding, bright, melodious hour comes sweetly as of yore; Night's starry tendernesses dower with glory evermore: But there be million hearts accursed, where no glad sunbursts shine, And there be million souls athirst for Life's immortal wine. This world is full of beauty, as other worlds above; And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love. If faith, and hope, and kindness passed, as coin, 'twixt heart and heart, Up through the eye's tear-blindness, how the sudden soul should start! The dreary, dim, and desolate, would wear a sunny bloom, And Love should spring from buried Hate, like flowers from Winter's tomb. This world is full of beauty, as other worlds above; And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love. Were truth our uttered language, Spirits might talk with men, And God-illumined earth should see the Golden Age again; The burthened heart should soar in mirth like Morn's young prophet-lark, And Misery's last tear wept on earth quench Hell's last cunning spark! This world is full of beauty, as other worlds above; And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love. We hear the cry for bread with plenty smiling all around; Hill and valley in their bounty blush for Man with fruitage crowned. What a merry world it might be, opulent for all, and aye, With its lands that ask for labour, and its wealth that wastes away! This world is full of beauty, as other worlds above; And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love. The leaf-tongues of the forest, and the flower-lips of the sodâ The happy Birds that hymn their raptures in the ear of Godâ The summer wind that bringeth music over land and sea, Have each a voice that singeth this sweet song of songs to meâ âThis world is full of beauty, as other worlds above; And, if we did our duty, it might be as full of love.â THERE'S NO DEARTH OF KINDNESS. There's no dearth of kindness In this world of ours; Only in our blindness We gather thorns for flowers! Outwardly we are spurningâ Trampling one another! While we are inly yearning At the name of âBrother!â There's no dearth of kindness Or love among mankind, But in darkling loneness Hooded hearts grow blind! Full of kindness tingling, Soul is shut from soul, When they might be mingling In one kindred whole. There's no dearth of kindness, Though it be unspoken; From the heart it sendeth Smiles of heaven in token That there be none so lowly, But have some angel-touch: Yet, nursing loves unholy, We live for self too much! As the wild-rose bloweth, As runs the happy river, Kindness freely floweth In the heart for ever. But if men will hanker Ever for golden dust, Best of hearts will canker, Brightest spirits rust. There's no dearth of kindness In this world of ours; Only in our blindness We gather thorns for flowers! O cherish God's best giving, Falling from above,â Life were not worth living, Were it not for Love. THE KNIGHTS OF LABOUR. Unite ye now, a Brother-band, With dauntless will, and stalwart hand: We are but few, toil-tried, and true, Yet hearts beat high to dare and do: And who would not a Champion be In Labour's Knightlier Chivalry? We fight! but bear no bloody brand, We fight to free our Fatherland: We fight that smiles of love may glow On lips where curses quiver now! Hurrah! Hurrah! true Warriors we, In Labour's Knightlier Chivalry! Ah! there be eyes that ache to see The day-dawn of our victory: Lives full of heart-break with us plead, And Watchers weep, and Martyrs bleed: O! who would not a Champion be In Labour's Knightlier Chivalry? Work, Brothers mine; work, brain and hand: To free our labour and our land; That Love's Millennial morn may rise On happy hearts and blessÃ¨d eyes. Hurrah! Hurrah! true Workers be In Labour's Knightlier Chivalry. THE CHIVALRY OF LABOUR. Our world oft turns in gloom, and Life hath many a perilous way, Yet there's no path so desolate and thorny, cold and gray, But Beauty like a Beacon burns above the dark of strife, And as an Alchemist she turns all things to golden life. On human hearts her presence droppeth precious manna down; On human brows her glory gathers like a coming crown: Her smile lights up Life's troubled stream, and Love, the swimmer! lives; And O, 'tis good to battle for the guerdon that she gives! Come let us worship Beauty with the Knightly faith of old, O Chivalry of Labour toiling for the Age of Gold! The first-fruits of the Past at Beauty's shrine are offered up, From which a vintage meet for Gods she crusheth in her cup: And from the living Present doth she press the rare new wine, To glad the hearts of all her Lovers with a draught divine. Earth's crowning miracle! she comes! with blessing lips, that part Like mid-May's rose flushed open with the fragrance of her heart: And life turns to her colourâkindles with her lightâlike flowers That garner up the golden fire, and suck the mellow showers. Come let us worship Beauty with the Knightly faith of old, O Chivalry of Labour toiling for the Age of Gold! Come let us worship Beauty where the budding Spring doth flower, And lush green leaves and grasses breathe out! sweeter hour by hour; Or Summer's tide of splendour floods the lap o' the World once more, With riches like a sea that surges jewels on its shore. Come feel her ripening influence when Morning feasts our eyesâ Through open gates of gloryâwith a glimpse of Paradise: Or queenly Night sits crownÃ¨d, smiling down the purple gloom, And Stars, like Heaven's fruitage, melt i' the glory of their bloom. Come let us worship Beauty with the Knightly faith of old, O Chivalry of Labour toiling for the Age of Gold! Come from the den of darkness and the City's soil of sin, Put on your radiant Manhood, and the Angel's blessing win! Where wealthier sunlight's shed from Heaven, like welcome-smiles of God, And Earth's blind yearnings leap to life in flowers from out the sod: Come worship Beauty in the forest-temple, dim and hush, Where stands Magnificence dreaming! and God burneth in the bush: Or where the old hills worship with their silence for a psalm, Or Ocean's weary heart doth keep the sabbath of its calm. Come let us worship Beauty with the Knightly faith of old, O Chivalry of Labour toiling for the Age of Gold! Come let us worship Beauty: she hath subtle power to start Heroic word and deed out-flashing from the humblest heart! Great feelings will gush unawares, and freshly as the first Rich Rainbow that up startled Heaven in tearful splendour burst. O blessed are her lineaments, and wondrous are her ways To picture God's dim likeness in the faded human face! Our bliss shall richly overbrim like sunset in the west, And we shall dream immortal dreams, and banquet with the Blest: Come let us worship Beauty with the Knightly faith of old, O Chivalry of Labour toiling for the Age of Gold! 1849. TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW. High hopes that burned like Stars sublime Go down i' the Heaven of Freedom, And true hearts perish in the time We bitterliest need 'em; But never sit we down and say There's nothing left but sorrow; We walk the Wilderness To-day, The Promised Land To-morrow. Our Birds of song are silent now; Few are the flowers blooming; Yet life is in the frozen bough, And Freedom's Spring is coming; And Freedom's tide creeps up alway, Though we may strand in sorrow; And our good Bark, a-ground To-day, Shall float again To-morrow! 'Tis weary watching wave by wave, And yet the Tide heaves onward; We climb, like Corals, grave by grave, That pave a pathway sunward; We are driven back, for our next fray A newer strength to borrow, And where the Vanguard camps To-day The Rear shall rest To-morrow! Through all the long, dark night of years The People's cry ascendeth, And Earth is wet with blood and tears, But our meek sufferance endeth. The Few shall not for ever sway, The Many moil in sorrow; The Powers of Hell are strong To-day, The Christ shall rise To-morrow! Though hearts brood o'er the Past, our eyes With smiling Futures glisten; For, lo! Our day bursts up the skies! Lean out your souls and listen! The world is rolling Freedom's way, And ripening with her sorrow: Take heart! who bear the Cross To-day Shall wear the Crown To-morrow. O Youth! flame-earnest, still aspire, With energies immortal! To many a heaven of Desire Our yearning opes a portal. And though Age wearies by the way, And hearts break in the furrow, Youth sows the golden grain To-day,â The Harvest comes To-morrow. Build up heroic lives, and all Be like a sheathen sabre, Ready to flash out at God's call, O Chivalry of Labour! Triumph and Toil are twins, though they Be singly born in Sorrow; And 'tis the Martyrdom To-day Brings victory To-morrow. LADY LAURA. Braveheart, the ardent Socialist, Fierce hater of all Wrong, Told us how Low and Lofty kissed, And sang their Wedding-Song. âThe Problem's solved,â laughed Pessimist; Now comes the Golden Year; âWhen Peeress is by Peasant kissed, And Peasantess by Peer!â [I.] Behold the Rainbow! how its Arch Of glory spans a world of green! Like Bridge of Triumph, all unseen, We passed through on the Midnight march! Midsummer Morn her silvery gray Rain-veil up-lifteth fold on fold; And purple-tinged and topped with gold The clouds grow fleecy and float away High o'er the Violet-shadowed Hills That take from them their soft attire: With fragrance and with sheeny fire All the blue round of Ãther fills: The air is like Heaven rippling down: The sweet South winds waft open wide The gates of Glory for the tide Of Summer: Lo! the flowers strewn In spray of white and waves of gold That glide along the fresh green ground: Such throng of blessings dances round The Earth's old heart; lo! these unfold! Wee cups of flowery wine brim high, By the way-side, on brier and bush; As lifted in a waiting hush By unseen hands for passers by. Her ripe cheek on the air, red Rose! She leaneth from her fragrant bower; Like lady from her latticed tower; And by sweet force of beauty blows! Glad to the heart with a golden dream, The little daisies lift the head; Their wee lips glister wet and red; Their look is thankful as a hymn. The wildest weed the wind hath sown, The commonest grass, is glorified, Even as the Tulip in her pride; The Trumpet of her beauty blown. At faÃ«ry palace-portals peer Quick eyes of Birds that sing i' the sun; Their hearts with music overrun; Listens each leafy forest ear. All Life lies in a bath of balm, And feels the lavish glory flow: Nothing to do but thrill and grow In strength, and joy, and luscious calm. Now Love breathes dewier delight, In cool green ways, and tender gloom; Being hath such a dazzling bloom; Its sun of bliss grows over-bright. And young maids feel love stir the blood To wanton with the kissing leaves And branches; and the quick sap heaves And dances with new life in flood. Till blown to its hidden heart with sighs, Love's red rose blooms in cheeks so dear, And like rich jewels upward peer Love-thoughts that swim through melting eyes. O balmy Morn! O tender type! What tearful wooings of the May Have brought about this bridal-day Of Earth the rathe with June the ripe! But, we must turn where Greed for Toil Hath closed and clasped this picture-book; Where Nature hath a Gnome-like look, And from her features dies the smile. II. Pleasantly rings the Chime that calls to Bridal-hall or Kirk; But Hell might gloatingly pull for the peal that wakes the babes to work! âCome, little Children,â the Mill-bell rings, and drowsily they run, Little old Men and Women, and human worms who have spun The life of Infancy into silk; and fed, Child, Mother, and Wife, The Factory's smoke of torment, with the fuel of human life. O weird white face, and weary bones, and whether they hurry or crawl, You know them by the Factory-stamp, they wear it one and all. The Factory-Fiend in a grim hush waits till all are in, and he grins As he shuts the door on the fair, green world without, and hell begins! The least faint living rose of health from the childish cheek he strips, To run the thorn in a Mother's heart: and ever he sternly grips His sacrifice; with Life's soiled waters turns his 'wildering wheels; And shouts, till his rank breath thickens the air, and the Child's brain Devil-ward reels. From Cockcrow until Starlight, very patiently they plod; A sea of human faces turning sadly up to God. O wan white winter world that hides no coloured dreams of Spring! No summer sunshine brightens; no buds blossom; no birds sing. In at the window Nature looks, and sings, and smiles them forth, To walk with her, and talk with her, and tread the summering Earth; And drink the air that cools the heart in pathways dim with dew; While the miracle of Morning raises glorified life anew. But they are shut from the heavenly largess; they must stint and moil, Though Death stare ghastly in their face, and life is endless toil. Did you mark how vacantly they eyed the land of loveliness, The Flower of Sleep into their eyes, your heart would ache to press. The moving glory of the heavens, their pomp and pageantry, Flame in their shadowed faces, but no soul comes up to see. They see no Angels lean to them; they stretch no spirit-hand; Melodious Beauty sings to them; they do not understand. Yet here, where the sweet flower of life may hoard no precious dew, To feed its heart of greenness, keep the glory of its hue; Here, where the fingers of Work and Want are writing silent, slow, Their warrant for the grave on many a Mother's darling's brow; Here, where the Fiend doth trample out the soul-sparks day by day; Here, where such seed of God is rotting in the killing clay; Some Saviour-Seraph walks the waves of sorrow and of sin, And some poor wrestler doth not sink the wrecking gulfs within; And aye she rises with her charge in loving arms caressed, As Morn emerges out of night, her love-star on her breast. III. In a grand old Gothic Palace, The Lady Laura dwells: It crowns the warm green valleys, high As the surge of summer swells. There, with her emerald chalice, Spring Kneels, offering beauty's wine; There, in a land of enchantment, sing The birds through shower and shine. 'Tis a noble solitude serene, Where the sudden glory glows! In a happy nook of nestling green, That Virginal flower blows,â Just in the sweetness of the bud, Brimming with brightness and balm; The tenderest glimpse of Womanhood Golden, and sweet, and calm. She is the Lily of the land; Born neither to spin nor toil: She can rest her fair cheek on her dainty white hand, While the human honey-bees moil. O the world of rich visions that peer in her eyes: Around her what fantasies dance! As she leans in her air of paradise, And the bower of dalliance: But her earnest life is sorrowfully O'ershadowed from above: She knows the ache of Life's mystery, And she feels the hurt of Love. The Lady Laura's soul is sad For the suffering under the sun: She looks on the world, and is only glad For the Duties to be done. She might have moved by in the pageant grand, Sweet slip of a lordly line! Nor soiled the glory of her white hand, And fairy fingers fine; And swam in this world's wine and oil, With those who sink for the next, Faint with delight, and plundered Toil With no strange thought perplexed. The burnished stream would have bravely borne Her, dancing down in its whirl; And the dark wreck-kingdom have proudly worn On its bosom the pure queen-pearl. But Sorrow hath touched her young, young years, When their rose-light was smiling and fair; And her eyes have wept the sharp, sharp tears, That pierce through all mirage of air. Ah, the Poor! with her finer sense she hears How they moan in their cloud of care. They will tell you down in the valleys What the Orphan Heiress hath done; How the grand old Gothic Palace With Love's new wine doth run. She is Dawn on the cold hill-tops that divide The Poor from their neighbour Rank; The first bright wave of a sluggish tide, That hath overleapt its bank. And to Lady Laura by window and door, Hearts climb with the Roses up, Their blessings to breathe, and their pride to pour, In many a brimming cup. Rebel hindrance she treads queenly down, Where it stands in her Throne's high way. O Factory-Fiend with the fearful frown, She blooms in your Desert to-day! IV. The lady Light hath Daughters seven, In sovereign state sit smiling fair On seats of cloud; but through the air They float on sunbeams down from Heaven: For they their lofty home will leave, To winnow, on their golden plumes, Through Ocean-bowers, and water-glooms; And wondrous spells of beauty weave To clothe the Sea-shells in their trance So lone and cold, with coloured lights, And jewel-flames; till their dim Night's Alive with shapes of radiance. On Alpine heights a little Flower From its snow-cradle soft doth reach; And with its tiny hands beseech Thy vesture-hem, Eternal Power! Then straightway help of heaven descends, And vital influences run Down golden ladders of the sun, And pleading life wins spirit-friends. Thus souls in barrenest solitude Oft bring the kindly powers down, To lighten on them with a crown, Or cheer them with immortal food. And thus on one poor Worker's sight Dawns Lady Laura through the mirk, Much marvelling how there may lurk A presence touched with tender light. His life stands still to hear what fate Comes with the step of mystery; And hushed for some event to be, In conscious calm the waters wait. She sees a prayer for rest and air In every face, but, in his eyes Alone, are childish memories; And his the only spirit there That waves the Seraph-wand of fire, To fright the Serpent flickering near. One jewel in that dark Mine! and clear It flashes as she brightens nigher. And all beside how dull and grim! O saintly show of maiden grace, From out a golden mist, her face Comes floating, floating on to him. Daughter of Light! she seems to swim, As on the wings of a mighty love; Sad-smiling his blind world above; Sunning that human forest dim. She speaks to him; she takes his hand; With such a gracious tenderness! The tears against his eyelids press; Life's waste in sudden flower doth stand. As when the spirit of Winter old Passes away in a dream of spring, The quick buds burst, and shimmering All into fluttering wings unfold, And wave so strong, and thrill so free, As they the wakened world would wing Along the warm way of the Spring, Where they are drawn deliciously: So from his life a burst of wings Is thrilling leaf-like for the light; And in that Splendour's wake of white, They make melodious murmurings. Light, Music, Fragrance, seem to kiss And swathe him in a bloom of fire; Make shining beauty his attire, And bury his dead past in bliss. At her soft touch ethereal dies The old dark, as Morning's spear of light Doth gently touch the dying night, And from it Day, a white Spirit, doth rise. V. The Lady Laura took him, in her kind and queenly way, From out that cruel iron world, to the tender human day. There all the folded bloom of life like a banner rich unfurled, And waved luxuriant in the air of a glad and glorious world. She fed his mind, she led his mind, through vistas strange and sweet; Ah, blessÃ¨d boon to toil and lay the fruitage at her feet! She took his widowed Mother; oh, the full and flowing hand! To rest her weary bones from toil, and live upon her land. Their barren world of poverty with flowers she girdled round, Till life that toiled with bleeding feet could walk on softer ground. My Lady comes; my Lady goes; his being doth rejoice, A breaking sea of rapture; every wave uplifts a voice. Like dungeoned foe that seeth the King's Daughter walking nigh, He blesseth the revealing dark for the beauty thronÃ¨d high, And in the beating of his heart, and flashing of his eye, A new life climbeth,âwaving glory,âas she passeth by. My Lady comes; my Lady goes; he can see her day by day, And bless his eyes with her beauty, and with blessings strew her way. My Lady comes; my Lady goes; she passes from his sight, As daylight dies into the skies, and at her gate stands Night. VI. Ah, little thinks my Lady Of the subtle seedling sown; But, fruitful was the silence Where its secret life hath grown. From human love's great ocean It draws the nursing springs; And 'tis fed on desert manna That her fragrant beauty brings. Ah, little thinks my Lady, As the days and seasons roll, How she took him by the hand, To pass into his soul. There she lives in a light of smiles; And like a soft caress, Her voice goes soothing, soothing With a kiss of tenderness. O Love, though shut without, will laugh All barriers above; And higher as they mount, still grows The stature of mighty Love. And bud by bud, the climbing seed Into a tall tree springs! Ah, little thinks my Lady What the Bird in the branches sings! VII. âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me, I think as I sit alone; And my heart o'er its tender secret Is brooding with love's sweet moan. âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me, And that soft smile of light, In a happy silence, through my life Goes circling out of sight. âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me, And I walk in a glory now; 'Tis writ on my cheek in a rose of pride; 'Tis read in a light on my brow. âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me, And my soul with bliss doth ache; So many a clue to happiness, I know not which to take! âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me, And the human world goes byâ In a sound as of Angels talking, And a feel as if Heaven swam nigh. âShe stooped to kiss me with her smile, Through the clouds where I darkly lay; As she glided through my night, My Moon! High on her heavenly way. âShe stooped to kiss me with her smile, And life soared up in flame! But, for my worship, not my kiss, The glorious phantom came. âShe smiled on me, she smiled on me; Ah me, that in her smiles My heart might break, in a wide love-wave, On her bosom's happy Isles!â VIII. âHeigh-ho! She will never be mine: Never! never. I know The grasp of gold My Jewel will hold: She is Lofty and I am Low. âHeigh-ho! but my heart like a Bird On wings of the night will go, To make its love-nest In that heaven of her breast, 'Neath the heaven of her eyes all aglow. âHeigh-ho! in dreams she is mine, All mine: and how can I know But she loves me in dream, With no drawn sword a-gleam, 'Twixt the kisses of Lofty and Low?â IX. âI love a lady all so far above Me, she can never hear the name of love; I only whisper to my heart in low Dark sayings what my Lady must not know; But, had I only a minute's space to live, And she beside me, I would pray her give Me on the mouth one dear and holy kiss; And straightway a warm stream of paradise Would gush and gladden all the gulf of death, A calm of blessÃ¨d faces take mine eyes; A hurricane of harpings take my breath: All heavÃ¨n would bend brooding down to meet Me, in that gracious stooping of my Sweet; And, at her touch, my soul should enter bliss.â X. âJust a smile i' the face of Nature, Just a mirror of May-morn, Is the shining, comely creature, Worshipped by the peasant-born. âBeauty has no rarer blossom, Budding fain, or flowering fair; Nestling to a Mother's bosom, If a Lover's hand should dare. âShe is graceful as the greenly Waving boughs in summer wind; And her beauty calm and queenly Wears its royal crown of mind. âMight I bear Love's shield above her; Might I snood her silken hair; How my heart would round her hover On the tender wings of care! âAh, dear Heaven, all blessings shower On her sweet life's balmy bud; Till it lift immortal flower, Blooming in the fields of God.â XI. A dazzling wonder in the dark of Dreams, His heart-hid Jewel gleams; And for a peerless richness it will range The zones of radiant change. Breathing soft hues the glorious thing doth shine, With lustres Opaline. The shifting Sapphire lovingly beguiles, With dewy azure smiles. The Ruby now with soul of crimson yearns, Or like a blood-drop burns. The Topaz in transparent hand doth hold Imprisoned flame of gold. Now twinkles from soft shade the Emerald tender, A drop of cool green splendour. Or, with love-drooping eye, the Pearl o' the deep Melts in a sea of sleep. And now, wide ope, it lights the inner night, A starry Chrysolite. And aye, for a peerless preciousness doth range The zones of radiant change. XII. As earliest flowers, the sweet first-love of Spring, Are tenderest in their fragranceâsaintliest pure, Love's firstlings, budding in the heart, unfold Most precious sweet of all the lusty year; And all his life is with their fragrance filled. In shy and shady nooks he steals, to brood O'er what his heart for worship lifteth up. With a ripe flush in his warm face the Dawn Withdraws the veil of dew-mist from the shape Of Beauty sleeping on the lap of Earth: So down into his secret soul he peers, Thinking of all her dear sweet womanly ways, To see the veilÃ¨d Beauty through the mist, And bows to bless her where she lies alight, Unconscious of the reddening dawn of love. A face, like nestling luxury of flowers; Soft hair, on which Light drops a diadem; The sweetest eyes,âah, when in their far heaven Shall Love rise up and beckon with the palm?â And all the beauty hid from mortal gaze Like lily-bud in leaves of cool green light. His happy eyes o'erflow with holy dew, Gathered in that rich air of secret love. Anon his heart goes wandering like a wind That reels through meads of spice, o'er hills of myrrh, Drunk with flower-fragrance, and the wine of love, And making music at the lightest touch, Till faint with sweets it wearies into rest. XIII. Lady of the forest Is the Silver Birk; Shimmering in the sunshine; Shivering at the mirk; Rocking in her rapture; A dancing Psaltress slim! Floating on the Wind-wave With a foam-light swim: Rustling in her richness, The Lady of the land; VeilÃ¨d when the gloaming Is gray with shadows grand; 'Mid the dance of colours And semitones of green, Gleams this daintier Spirit That in leafdom is the Queen. Of all the Trees o' the forest, He loves the Silver Birk, Shimmering in the sunshine, Shivering at the mirk, So like the Lady Laura In her purity and grace; Dreaming in its shadow, Often rose her face! And as when a Sunburst Makes golden the green Aisles, The Woodland water smileth, So his heart within him smiles. XIV. One Summer eve he sat beneath the white Grace of the Wood; Where Birds of Thought so often brought his love ambrosial food; When all the spirits of the flowers stole forth i' the hush of night, And all the greenwood slumbered softly in a dream of light. The world lay in a purple calm, and tenderness of tears; In every pulse of being lived the tenderness of years. He had wrestled with his passion,âcaught up in its strong caressâ Voluptuous as a Bride of Fire, with arms as pitiless. He had wept his pain in a fiery rain, and a calm fell from afar, As a vision of sweet Peace comes treading down the spears of war. Then in a trembling confidence of love to himself he talked, And sang above his whispering heart, that felt what Spirit walked. âWe cannot lift the wintry pall From buried life; nor bring Back, with Love's passionate thinking, all The glory of the Spring. But soft along the old green way We feel her breath of gold; Glad ripples round her presence play, She comes! and all is told. âSo in Her absence Memory Aye strives, but cannot paint The Vision of her majesty; The Sweetness of my Saint. She comes! like dawn in spring her fame! My winter-world doth melt; The thorns with flowers are a-flame! She smiles! and all is felt.â Is it a vision! or the pure pale face Of Lady Laura, visible through the trees? Strange fire consumes the rich dew of her eyes! Trembles her lip; her soul, though very calm, Gleams like a naked sword from its soft sheath. Ah, she has found his secret in its nest! And will she crush him with her killing scorn? He dare not know. She speaks; he scarcely hears, So loud the blood goes singing through his brain. âI am no longer Mistress at the Hall; False friends have robbed me of my Home; they keep My Lands until the Law shall do me right. I leave To-morrow morn. I think you have The mounting spirit to rise where'er you fall, And shall rejoice to mark your fortunes shine.â She paused; he raised his eyes to hers, and saw The unuttered something that could not be told! Her rustling robe thrilled all his life, and then The sound of footsteps died upon the night. XV. Like one caught in the Tempest's arms unseen, Dashed overboard unheard, and left to fight With the mad waves, blindfolded by the gloom, All through that desolate dark he wrestled lone; Tossing tumultuous in a storm of soul; And lived his life o'er in the agony stern, As on the drowning rushes all the past. Again he saw her in the Silk-Mill stand Complete in beauty, crowned with meekest calm, As missioned Angel down to Hell wings when Some suffering Spirit's time is up in Heaven. He went with her among the Poor where fell Her smile as sunshine on a harvest land; And from the folded flowers of thorny life, Her presence charmed a kindlier spirit forth; He, hoarding up their blessings in his heart. He saw her in the Spring-dawns gliding down, Like Morning on the world, its Comforter. Darkened into himself, he watched, all eye, Like Spirit that sees its mortal love go past, Itself invisible. In languorous noons Of summer, when, a Shape of fragrant warmth, Nature seems glowing through her sumptuous robe, With all her beauty bosoming tenderly; And from behind the mask of leaves and flowers, Her passion takes you with ambrosial breath; He in the cool, green shadows would lie down, O'er him the trees a lowe of glimmering gold, To kiss where the beloved foot had touched, And sanctified the sod her skirt had swept, With Lover's lip of fire, and fondling cheek, All tingling through and through with fervid life. He saw the visible Divinity O' the time and place, taking her twilight walk, Starrily moving in an air of glory; The serious sea-blue dreaming in her eyes; Her lofty graces robed about with heaven; And drank the wine of wonder as she went. Ah, happy times, when on the top of life He saw her beauty's daily sunrise, heard Her voice, and breathed the air made holy by her, And in her presence cloud-like sunned himself, With a sweet silent awe; while all his heart With rich love trembled as 'twould break for bliss; Like shaken dews in jewelled cups of morn! Ah, happy nights, and lustrous darks, in which He watched her window when the house was mute, And Silence took the place in loving arms, Where the tall Chestnuts hushed her beauty round, Uplifting in their hands a light of flowers! There with its speechless yearning strove his heart, O'erflowing till the night was filled with love. How often through the winter wind and rain, His spirit fluttered to her, winged with blessings. And he stood clothed and warmed with thoughts of her; And through the darkness and the cold, his love Glowed like a watch-fire in a wilderness; Or glistened upward in a light of tears; Soul-diamonds of the purest waterâtears Like dewdrops in the flower-cups held toward Heaven; Such as the Angels wear for jewels in heaven. Ah, happy times that wave their sad farewells, To come no more, no more, O Nevermore! To him, who, tasting the forbidden tree, Now sat at Eden gates, and they were closed. Sudden a thought struck new life through him as strikes Land at the swimmer's feet who gives up lost! He who could die for her, could he not live For her, and help her win her rightful throne? He sat not down on shore to mourn his wreck; Not his the heart to wail when he might work. That night hath passed; but from its death-bed rose A Star, to sing and sparkle in his soul, And light him to some crowned accomplishment. XVI. O mighty mystery London, there be Children still, who hold Her Palaces are silver-roofed, her pavements are of gold; And blindly in that dark of fate, they grope for the golden prize, For somewhere hidden in her heart the charmÃ¨d treasure lies. Such glory burning in the skies, she lifts her crown of light Above the dark, we see not what we trample in the night. O merry world of London! O aching world of moan, How many a soul hath stooped to thee, and lost its starry throne! There Circe brims her sparkling ruby, dancing welcome,âlaughs All scruples down with wicked eye, and the crazed lover quaffs, Until the fires of Hell have left white ashes on his lips; And there they pass whose tortured heart the worm that dies not grips. The stricken crawl apart to die. There, many a bosom heaves With merry laughters mournful as the dancing of dead leaves. There griping Greed rich-heaps the yellow wealth of Bank and Shop, As Autumn leaves grow goldenest when rotten-ripe to drop: And many melt the marrow of their Manhood, sere its bloom, In Passion's serpent arms, and with her kiss of fire consume: And Vanity sideling seeks a mirror in each passing face. But through the dark some luminous lives flash up and pray Heaven's grace. All beauteous stand her Idols shining on their azure height, And from their fairy heaven lean veiled Shapes, half-dim, half-bright; They draw us with a dream delicious to the aching sight; Arms stretched with longing, bosom sweets, ripe lips, and merry Brides; Beds of lilies and roses! low sweet music, worlds besides! And day by day, on each highway, from many a sunny shire, The country life comes green to wither for the hungry fire. All into London leaping, leaping flows the human sea, Where, wreck at heart, or prize in arms, the waves flash merrily. With a prayer to God on high, he sees the tumult, hears the strife, And dives, from out the gulfs to snatch a jewel worth a life. The Lady Laura leaneth like a bending heaven above, And his life is safely steadied by the anchor of his love. Three times into the City ran and breathed the news of Spring: Sweet Primrose-time is come again, and silver showers sing. The cloudy imagery of heaven sails o'er him day by day, He watches parching as the Palm when rain floats far away, All thirsty, as the Hero's soul with glory's burning drouth! And yearning, as the dying yearn for a death-bed in the South! For Spring's warm breath, and bright caress, and pleasant feel of leaves, And all her beauty moist with morn, his heart within him grieves. The country memories rich inlaid, so fragrantly are stirred, As spice-winds whisper something low, or sings a prisoned Bird. The green-woods beckon spirit-like through dreams of azure sky; All heaven looks out from a flower as from his Beloved's eye, And visions of a lovelier-lighted life go shining by. Above that wilderness o' the weary oft he sat alone; His soul was working with the waves that, ever and anon, Revealed the proud wave-wrestler Hope forever battling on! And ever through the dark the Lady Laura smiling shone. The night was free and all his own, life rose fantastic-towered; Full-honeyed with its folded Spring, his shut heart bud-like flowered. Upon the stream that pined all day, the calm of heaven doth rest; Its Star of love, though far above, keeps bridal on its breast. Pure, painÃ¨d Loveliness! she walks a world of wrong and guile, Yet nightly looketh in his face with the same sweet, patient smile. While ever and forever goeth up to God for doom, The City's breath of life and death, in glory or in gloom; And there it rings each spirit round, of light or darkness woven, And they shall wake and walk their self-unfolded hell or heaven. Nightly a merry harvest-home the Devil in London drives, And gathers on the shores of hell the wreck of human lives. XVII. A lonely life, a lonely lot; He climbs his mountain day by day; But finds beside the stoniest way Love's wild rock-honey, and fainteth not. He sees the Vision shine afar; Sweet Wedded lives in happy home; And strains his eyes against the gloom, Like Nuns that throb at prison-bar, Wooed by a dear and dazzling dream, When through the mirk Love's glory burns. The hearth of Home warm welcome yearns; His face is glowing with the gleam And sparkle of their brimming cup, Who round the Home-Altar dance and sing, All in a golden marriage-ring, And light with love Life's picture up. They sit in nestling nook, and see The ripening promise of the years; The budding quicks, the springing ears; Flowers honey-wet, and fruits to be. As bridal-gifts from God above, The Children bring their glad new spring; Past joy's refrain their voices ring, All loud with mirth, or lown with love. Fine actions feed Love's holy fire, Like sandal-wood of fragrant gold; Till heavenward, glorious to behold, It breaks, in many a splendid spire. There, hand in hand, they reach across A double range of rich delights; And climb in safety where the heights Of Life have many a chasm of Loss. A happy soul goes singing aloft, Ere closes their day-book of bliss, So gently claspÃ¨d with a kiss, While loving eyes grow still more soft. âO BlessÃ¨d Bird that soars and sings, And moves in heaven on triumphing wings; Then drops to rest Within my breast, And aye some balm of blessing brings. âO Flower of mine, Life's stream may start Thy trembling leaves, but cannot thwart Love's calm below, Where wed roots grow In twin strength, smiling heart to heart. âO crest of beauty on my brow; O light of love upon my prow; To the death-dark I row my bark; You gild with glory as we go.â 'Tis merry to walk the deck of life, Though billows beat, and wild winds blow, And proudly feel they rest below; That precious freightage, Weans and Wife. But, he drifts on, in lonely bark, Past shining home, and singing isle. Fine Apparition, with a smile Like spirit-music! in the dark Her sudden beauty lightens near, And bows him to the knees in prayer. He needs long draughts of heavenly air, Who dives to clutch a pearl so dear. âI may not reach to wreathe you yet, dear friend, Although of your great courtesy you bend Toward me that stand a-tip-toe as you bow; I must mount higher ere I crown your brow, And lead you forth where all the world may see The dear good Angel you have been to me.â XVIII. âThe Larch is snooding her tresses In a twine of the daintiest green; With fresh spring-breath the Hawthorn heaves His breast to the sunny sheen. A shower of spring-green sprinkles the Lime; A shower of spring-gold the Broom; And each rathe tint of the tender time Wakes the wish that my Lady were Home. âIn the Coppice, the dear Primroses Are the smile of each dim green nook, Gravely gladsome; sunny but cool With the sound of the gurgling brook. And by the wayside in a burst of delight From the world of Fairy and Gnome, All the Flowers are crowding to see the sight At their Windows. My Lady, come Home! âThe Country's growing glorious Quietly day by day; The colour of April comes and goes In a blush to meet the May. And the spring-rains steal from their heaven of shade, In a veil of tender gloam, With a splendid sparkle for every blade: Dear my Lady, come Home! âThe Spirit of Gladness floating Goes up in a sound of song: Robin sings in the rich eve-lights; The Throstle all day long: The Lark in his heaven that soars above Each morn with more distant dome; All sweet! but sweeter the voice we love. Come Home, my Lady, come Home! âYour Apple-blooms are fragrant Beyond the breath of the South; Every bud, for an airy kiss, Is lifting a rosy wee mouth. A greener glory hour by hour, And a peep of ruddier bloom, But the leafy world waiteth its Human Flower. Dear my Lady, come Home! âOur thoughts are as the Violets Around the Ash-tree root, That breathe the earliest hints of Spring At their lofty lady's foot, And wonder why she still delaysâ When the sea of life is a-foam With flowersâto crown her in these glad days. Come Home, my Lady, come Home! âCome! feel the deepening dearness About the grand old place. Come! let us see the cordial smile Once more in our Lady's face. Winter was dreary: of waiting we weary: Best of all joy-bringers, come! Spread bonny white sails! blow balmy spring-gales! And bring my Lady Home!â XIX. To-day, with his work done, the Victor stands; His brows are bound by Lady Laura's hands. He conquered. To her feet he brought the prize. Twin worlds of bliss rose throbbing in her eyes; Sparkled her smiling soul like that of a child, And smiling, all her life in love-light smiled. She gloweth happy as the tender South, When Spring doth kiss her on the flowery mouth. The lilies white upon the stream of life Stir with the sweet feel of its dancing strife. If but one favouring breath of fortune move, Into his bosom drops the fruit of love. Then from the heart's heaven a sweet simple grace Came blushing all the secret in her face; He looked into the windows of her eyes To see Love, sitting by the hearth, arise And let him in, and lead him to his throne, For love and worship through all worlds his own. On her white holy hand the ring of gold Exults its branch of glory to enfold. Comes forth in greeting all the country side, To welcome Lady Laura home, a Bride. Ring, merry bells, ring, blithesome bridal bells! To the tune of happy hearts your triumph swells. Upon his life now leaneth fragrantly The rose of her ripe beauty rare to see. In honeyed light, and sweet with pleasant showers, Lies all the land, a coloured flame of flowers, And with a sidelong grace smiles of the sight; Heaven shakes its bridal torch and laughs delight. XX. âMy life lay like a Sea-bud, dark upon the watery wold, That feels when Spring is in the world, and striveth to unfold; The breath of Love passed o'er me, and the Spring went laughing by, Till on a sudden I was 'ware, BelovÃ¨d, thou wert nigh! The Bird of Love to my window came, and sang a strain divine; Sweet Bird! he makes his nest, I said, 'neath other eaves than mine: But many a day hath come and gone, and still he sits and sings His song of happy futures, and of dear remembered things. âMy life went darkling like the Earth, nor knew it shone a Star To that dear Heaven on which it hung in worship from afar. O, many bared their bravery like flowers to the bee; She might have ranged Elysian fields, but nestled down by me: A King upon his Throne would have smiled her to his side; But, with a lowly majesty she came to me, my Bride, And grandly gave her love to me, the dearest thing on Earth, Like one who gives a jewel, all unweeting of its worth. âO, was it an Immortal Child, left by a fair Dream-Bride, Seen in a world of vision with mine eyes stretched spirit-wide? Or was the Image pictured, by the sun of another life, In secret soul, that I might know its living form my Wife? I say not; but, when luminous she floated on to me, Methought she flamed from out the mist of some far memory. The hiding Love just stirring the spring-roses of her face; The picture of sweet Saintliness; the glory and the grace. â'Twas when the Earth her green lap spreads for Summer's gorgeous gifts; And plump for kisses of the Sun, her ripened cheek uplifts; When May among her flowers was caught in lusty arms of June; She newly strung my harp of life, and played its sweetest tune. O, I had been content to live in a Cottage of the clay, So I might see and bless her, when she chanced to pass that way; But she came down from her heaven, with a look that glorified, And I clasp my heart's sweet Vision; lo! a nestling human Bride.â XXI. Calm is their sheltered shore of life, caressed By gentle tides of peace, whose murmurs are Of storms at rest, and sorrows sanctified. But not for them alone the honey-time, And bliss of being! hearts were all too full Of lusty longing for all human good; Their happiness was only meant to share. That luminous revealer, hallowing Love, Gave them the Seeing eye, not drooping lid. His Chosen are but caught up into Heaven, For wider vision of a suffering Earth. Their doubled bliss ran over to make rich, And freshen with a spring of joyful life The poor world kneeling at the feet of theirs. And not forgotten was that Factory-world, Which like a doomed Ship far away i' the night Pleadedâeach port-hole lighted up for help! Christ bleeding on the Cross for Centuries? And still His Poor their long redemption waitâ Still tempted of the Devil in the Desert. Still are they, crouching by the fireless hearth, In the dead winter often driven to burn The furniture of life to make a fire, And scare the gaunt wolf Hunger, whose eyes glare In at the window lit with bloody lust! Sometimes a cry runs throbbing through the night, As though Creation quickened with the birth Of new life strange and monstrous in our world. Then startled Fear from his high lattice looks, With face as white as death-touched Want's below. There rage a people like a forest a-fire! Grim on the banner Labour's challenge claims, âLeave to live working, or die fighting.â Fear Sends forth his Guards, and to his pillow slinks. Red Murder leaps up sudden in their midst; The gathering of fierce suffering breaks in blood: Begins again the old long agony, And Order reigns! though many a day the Ghost Of Revolution at his Banquet sits, And standeth Sentry at his door o' nights. O hopeless Poor, and impotently Rich! O hurrying host of battling enmities, That, fighting, feel no earthquake rock the ground! O human world, that pants without the pale Of harmony, the universal law, Like Soul, with troublous wail, shut out of bliss! Shall it not come, the time of which we dream, To crown long years of strife, and blood, and tears, When from the Book the Poet's thought shall step Clothed on with human lineaments, and live? And this Ideal of our hopeful Brave Stoop down and dwell with us in daily life, And Earth and Heaven mix in each other's arms? They deem so, who, with visionary eyes, Have seen it, glassed in mirrors of the mind: And held communion with that world to come; Our wedded pair: their faith made quick by love: They look withinâits likeness comes that way. And they will make their outer life a dial, On which the inner light may rise and shine; And touch with radiance soft some sullen spot Where falls the shadow of evil, till a smile Dawns on its face as it turns up to God. Ho for the New World and its Golden Age Of delicate dream-work, and of rich romance! They bought the Factory: turned its stream of toil To a flood of Joy, on Lady Laura's lands. There Life, whose dark and stagnant waters swarmed With hideous things, in merry radiance runs; Brightens with health, and breaks in frolic spray; Peeps through a garland green, and laughs in light; Its rest, blessÃ¨d as though the calm high heavens Had looked it into some transfiguring trance, Then with light-hearted morrow sparkling onâ So to the dark arch Death, through which it runs In sheen and shadow for the shoreless sea. They built their other world, wherein the Poor Might grow the flower of Hope, and fruit of Love; And human trees, with outstretched arms of cheer, Might mingle music, wreathe in bud and bloom, And in their branches nest the birds of God, That in immortal beauty whitely hover, But come not down to build while boughs are bare. No more were little Children left to prowl In mental darkness Vermin-like for prey, With the masked human likeness lost in grime. No more the tiny Orphans peer above The Dock, to laugh blind Justice in the face. She takes her bandage off to look at them! Then folds them to her breast to Mother them. Hear how the Children in the Schoolroom sing! âUp in the morning early, While yet the grass is pearly, The air is bright and cool; All clad in our best graces, With happy Morning-faces, We wend our way to School. âTo-day is life in blossom, With Heartsease in each bosom, And all is beautiful: A Spirit, within us springing, At Heaven's Gate will be singing Thanks for the Children's School. â'Tis here we learn to lighten The human lot, and brighten The day most dark with dool; And lay up Childhood's treasure, To reap immortal pleasure; In Lady Laura's School. âWe sun us in its brightness, We clothe us with its Whitenessâ As doth the Wayside Pool That holds from morn till even, Its bit of purest heaven,â In Lady Laura's School. âThe Summer Earth rejoices; With hers we lift our Voices, And Heaven blends the whole: And when God's Angels cover us, They draw the darkness over us, And bless the Children's School.â They were denounced as Socialists; tabooed By Clericals, as enemies of God, And held accursed as foes of Capital, But answered not, save by their Godward work. They raised no Paupers: grew no Criminals, Nor asked for Rates in aid of Poverty: Where all were Workers there was wealth for all! They Bought and Sold, they Ploughed, and Sowed, and Reaped. Cheapness, Free Trade, and such Economy As suck their strength from human blood and tears; Feeding on Beauty's waste, and Childhood's spring; Shredding with wintry hand life's leafy prime; They bowed not down toâBaal of the strife That gives the Devil his own vantage-ground, Where each man's hand is at his Brother's throat; The Knight in golden mail combats the Naked, And hearts must run with never-tiring wheels; The weak go down; the Victors merciless Still wield the Sword of Selfish interest, To win their crown of Individual gain, And throne of Isolation cold and lone, Their Iceberg in a sea of misery! Not this, but life of freedom, law of love; The Wine-press trod by each, the Cup for all; In this serener worldâthis Morning Star That rises out of Chaos and old night, Like throbbing heart of some Millennial Day. Here, life is no soul-sickening round of toil; No need to blink the Spirit's longing sight. Here, simple Childhood opens vernal eyes, And young blood dances through the veins of Age. White Cottage Homes rise from the sea of green, Like clouds where happy spirits sit and sing The old wild-briar of Labour, grafted bears The radiant Roses of a warmer world; With kindlier nurture blossoms forth anew, A glory of Flowers, and wears immortal green. Breaks the stern granite, sparkling into beauty, And precious jewels glow from common stones: Soft white hands smoothe the brow of wrinkled Wrath; The gentle balm of Love makes hard eyes soft, And melted hearts to swim through woe-worn looks, With sweet and delicate human tenderness. The trampled battle-field of sin-scarred faces Is healÃ¨d with the harvest of ripe love; Its frowning furrows crowned with golden smiles. Over their World where Passion hurtled down Burning instead of beauty, as its sun, And all around was black eternal night; Love's radiant shadow sheds an atmosphere Of soft celestial brightness, calm, and peace. Here Life goes hand in hand with happy things; In lovely shadow-lands with Spirits talks; There with all gracious Shapes of Beauty moves, And wins Their motion, majesty, and mien; And rears his temple rich for God, inlaid With precious jewels and colours fair, and cries, âBehold how good and joyful a thing it is To dwell together in peace and unity, And work to win the perfect humanhood.â Thus Lady Laura and her peasant Lord Built o'er the dead past their proud monument, That signals to far times their Guild of love: And God was with them smiling on their work. They wrought not without hindrance, sorrow and pain: Who work for Freedom win not in an hour; Their cost of conquest never can be summed. They toil and toil through many a bitter day, And dark, when false friends flee, and true ones faint. The seed of that great Truth from which shall spring The forest of the future, and give shade To those who reap the harvest, must be watched With faith that fails not, fed with rain of tears, And walled around with life that fought and fell. WAR-WAITS. Like Children, peering from some distant nook, What time the Soldiers pass with pealing strains And bannered pomp to Battle far ablaze, We peered into the passing scenes of War,â Its crowning heaven aglow with starry hopes; Its crowded hell of red and writhing pain, With hearts that ached and burned, as kindled cheeks Flamed up with reddening shame or bloom of pride; And told the story as the deeds were done. NEW YEAR'S EVE IN EXILE. The Flower and Chivalry of many lands, Doomed Watchers of their own Lands from afar; Warriors of Freedom, who for heritage Bore on their brows a sign as cursed as Cain's; Betrothed to Martyrdom as to a Bride, Had met together, a strange Company, But Brothers who were battling for one Cause. They were heroic Souls who had lain life's all On Freedom's hungry Altar, and gone forth Clad in the spirit of self-sacrifice, To roam a thankless world with homeless hearts,â Men who had tossed on Danger's wildest waves, For whom a radiant Victory ever shone, Like Hero on her Watch-tower with her torch, Lighting her Lover through the shadow of death,â Men who had broken Battle's burning lines, And dealt death with their hands, life with their looks, And in the last stern charge of desperate valour On Death's scythe dashed with force that turned its edge. Some were but Youths, yet with such manhood flushed, By eager leaps to reach a lordlier life, They had attained the old heroic stature. Some had grown gray with battle, some with years, And there were ancient Sorrows grand as kings Of an old peerless line. Great silent Griefs And Sufferings crowned for immortality! Earnest as fire they sate, and reverent As though a God were present in their midst; Stern, but serene and hopeful, earnest, brave, As Cromwell's Ironsides on a battle-eve; Each individual life as clenched and knit, As though beneath their robes their fingers clutched The weapon sworn to strike a Tyrant down, That would not flash except to light his fall. And in their midst Mazzini rose to speak The kindling thought that fused them all as one. And O, but hearts flew out, like Freedom's bird, To flap their wings above the flag of war. And fierce looks flashed, and prayers went up to God In Fiery Chariots of their fervent souls; Stern eyes were veiled with noble tears to see That Exile by the hounds of torture tracked; Who, while they tore his stricken life, still drank His cup of trembling, smiling very calm. Dilating as the Prophet's soul of flame Lightened within him, all his aspect burned With an unearthly fire: he was caught up The Mount Transfiguration, with eyes fixed Far-off, intense as though he talked with God, He stood there gazing down the unseen time Like some hoar Hill that loftily o'erlooks The mists of night, and rises with bare brow To catch the unrisen Morn. While all the plains Below were darkling, he already sunned Him in the glory of the coming day. And his words swept their yielding, springing hearts, As strong winds take a field of billowing corn. âThe merry bells are jubilant To-night Through all the land of Exile; blithe wine laughs Its bubbling laughter,âwinking gem-like eyes, And leaps up in the beaker like red lips Whose kisses storm the inner gates of bliss. But not with mirth, and song, and dainty feast, We meet to hold our solemn festival. We wait the wine of Freedom: when it runs, We shall wax merry too,âperchance grow drunkenâ They keep it ripening to such mellow age! And we shall banquet like Immortals fed By Hebe's hand at the Ambrosial feasts. âThe New Year flashes on us sadly-grand, Leaps in our midst with ringing armour on, Strikes a mail'd hand in ours, and bids us arm Ere the first trumpet sound the onset hour. Dense darkness lies on Europe's winter-world. Stealthy and grim the Bear comes creeping forth, Out of the North, and all the Peoples sleep By Freedom's smouldering watch-fire: there is none To snatch the brand, and dash it in his face. Old England sleeps, and still the Bear steals on. Ah! she forgetteth how, in the old years, The great hearts of her glorious Commonwealth Sent thunder-throbbings through the lands, and gave them Such a new pulse of nobler life: and when Their sumless Venture wrecked, and o'er them rolled The wormwood waters of defeat and death, How in their pleading hands they held the Babe And Orphan Liberty, and bade her rear it For love of them, and for its own dear sake. Old England halts behind the nations now. Dim is her Beacon Despots paled to see Burn on them through the dark, like God's stern eye. Her battle-armour rusteth on her walls, And the once mighty arm that struck such blows For Right and Freedom, droopeth listless now. A dry-rot eats her life: her God is Mammon! God Mars no longer leaps into her heart, As in a Chariot driving down to battle. Her ancient fame and valour have become A tale that's told us of forgotten timesâ Some fabled Kraken slumbering in its sea! O! for the voice of Milton once again, To make the lion-eyes lighten, and her heart As tremblingly alive as is a Star, Till in her naked strength majestical She walked the sun-road of her glorious way. âBut England sleepsâthe Ruin still rolls on. Earth crouches 'neath the shuddering wings of Fear. Silent, and very calm, Freedom lies hushed, And listens like a panting thing pursued, Heark'ning, heart-stifled, for the stealthiest tread Of One that hunts like Tarquin for Lucrece. 'Tis midnight now, and all the creeping things, And Birds of Darkness, ply their ghastly work: Life gropes and stumbles among gaping graves, And Freedom's worshippers fall headless, while They bend to give their hearts up at her shrine! But God's in heaven, and yet the day shall dawnâ Break from the dark upon her golden wings, Her quickening splendours rend and burn the gloom, Her living tides of glory burst, and foam, And hurry along the darksome streets of night. Cloud after cloud shall light a rainbow-roof, And build a Triumph-Arch for conquering Day To flash her beautyâtrail her grandeurs through, And take the world in her white arms of light. And Earth shall fling aside her mask of gloom, And lift her tearful face. O there will be Blood on it thick as dews! The Children's blood Splashed in the Mother's face! And there must be A red sunrise of retribution yet! A mighty Future is about to break The hush o' the worldâthe waiting gloom in heaven. âThe New Year cometh with a magic key, To ope some radiant chamber in Time's palace. Our Martyrs have not sown such seed in vain! Beneath old Winter's snows a world of hope Lies ripening, and shall richly run to flowers, When Earth shall kindle as a countenance Alive with love, and all the soul alight! O come, thou Spring of God, and at thy voice The balmy blood shall beat in bud and leaf! And come, thou mellow rain, fall on it warm, And fondle it with kisses, drop rich tears; And blow, thou sweet Spring-wind, and make it stir With secret raptureâbudding tenderly, With all the glory of its folded bloom, And all its fragrance striving for the light. God, what a Spring and Harvest yet shall crown The dark, dern Deluge of Calamity! Then come, thou grand New Year, in silence come Across the white snows, and the winter-land. Come, great Deliverer, call the peoples up,â Up from the Egypt of their slavery! Ring out the death-knell of old Tyrannyâ 'Tis rotten ripe, the heart of half the world Doth beat and burst to hurry it into hell. Stride o'er the Present, grand as some huge wave Should rise and rush o'er Panama at a leap, And make two Seas one perfect world of waters. So link our great Past to a nobler Future, And set our new world singing on its way. âA little while and England must awake! She has but swooned beneath the kiss of Peace, And languished in her long voluptuous dream, While weed-like creatures crept along her path. Where leaped of old proud waves of glorious life, The sluggish channels choke with golden sand. The hills of light rose shining far away, Where she should stand and touch the hem of Heaven; But, day by day she darkened deeper down. The cold, grim shadow stretched o'er half the earth, Came freezing round her watchfire's dying flame, While spirit-finger-pointings signalled her, And spirit-rustlings stirred the air in vain. A fire of anguish flamed from Poland's eyes When the red Deluge closed above her head: Sodden with suffering and unwept tears, The heart of Hungary pled in silence stern: Poor Italy lay guarded in her grave, Her life all crouching in one listening sense, To catch aught stirring in the upper world: Out of the North the brute Colossus strode, With grimly-solemn pace, proud in the might That moves not but to crush, and terribly towered Its growing shape through Battle's bloody gap Where Nations fell; and like a Cyclop's eye Its one idea lit it to the prey: While pale Expediency paltered for The peaceful chance of being eaten last. âA little while and England will awake, Like Sternness stripped for strife: Grim-wooing War Reflect his terrible beauty in her face; Her heart will dance to a strain of loftier life, On fire to bring the death-strokes hand to hand. For God will call His Chosen once again, And the Old Guard of Freedom take the field. Rejoicing in the glory of her strength, Like some proud cataract she will shout for the strife, And hurl her hurrying waves of valour down: The glorious shudder of intrepid blood Will hurtle through her veins, and Victory's voice Cry from the inmost Oracle of her soul. Her swift avenging armaments shall flame O'er land and sea, sublime as when of old With a colossal calm she rode the waves Of war, that heaved magnificent in storm. The noble prophecy of ripened age Was on her youthful brow; fulfilment comes. She lifts the Ark of Freedom in her arms, Safe through the deluge of a warring world. A little while and we shall yet return Each to his Fatherland like kings to conquest. Light breaks there, in the East, 'twill soon be day, And we shall see that God through all the dark Did combat for us with the visor down. Fight on, you faithful, Heaven's glooming look Frowns only on the wrong. This dark shall break In resurrection hour! The chariot-wheels Of coming Vengeance spin too swift for sight: The Nemesis of Nations only waits, Until the glass of Destiny runs out, To wake the Murderers with her whip of fire, Caught by the hair in sudden hands of Hell; While in a ruddy rain old Earth laughs up. âO, we shall see a sight ere England's Sun Goes down behind her hills of gathered gold! When Spring's young hopes seem dead and her sweet buds Are in the dust, our Autumn-fruitage comes! The time of times, the year of years is nigh. But no more Words! Like Weeds they sap the soul Of richness that should fill the fruit of deeds. Henceforth let lips be dumb, as Braveryâ Her parley doneâhad shut the gates to ope not Save for the shouts that chariot Victory forth. We are all ready! We have waited long! God strikes the hour, and let the trumpet ring.â 1853â4. ENGLAND GOES TO BATTLE. Now, glory to our England, She arises, calm and grand, The ancient spirit in her eyes,â The good sword in her hand! Our royal right on battle ground Was aye to bear the brunt: Ho! brave heart! with one passionate bound, Take the old place in front! Now, glory to our England, As she rises, calm and grand, The ancient spirit in her eyesâ The good sword in her hand! Who would not fight for England? Who would not fling a life I' the ring to meet a Tyrant's gage, And glory in the strife? Her stem is thorny, but doth burst A glorious Rose a-top! And shall our proud Rose wither? First We'll drain life's dearest drop! Who would not fight for England? Who would not fling a life I' the ring, to meet a Tyrant's gage, And glory in the strife? To battle goes our England, As gallant and as gay As Lover to the Altar, on A merry marriage-day. A weary night she stood to watch The clouds of dawn up-rolled; And her young heroes strain to match The valour of the old. To battle goes our England, As gallant and as gay As Lover to the Altar, on A merry marriage-day. Now, fair befall our England, On her proud and perilous road: And woe and wail to those who make Her foot-prints red with blood! Up with our Red-cross banner,âroll A thunder-peal of drums! Fight on there, every valiant soul, Have courage! England comes! Now, fair befall our England, On her proud and perilous road: And woe and wail to those who make Her foot-prints red with blood! Now, victory to our England! And where'er she lifts her hand In Freedom's fight, to rescue Right, God bless the dear Old Land! And when the Storm hath passed away, In glory and in calm, May she sit down i' the green o' the day, And sing her peaceful psalm. Now, victory to our England! And where'er she lifts her hand In Freedom's fight, to rescue Right, God bless the dear Old Land! TROOPS LEAVING EDINBURGH. For Freedom's battle march Auld Scotland's men, And Edinburgh streets are piled with life to-day. High on her crags the royal City sits, To watch the files of war far-winding out, And with the gracious golden Morning smiles Her proudest blessing down. Old Arthur's Seat Flings up his cap of cloud for brave success; While the Sea flashes in the sun, our Shield, So rich in record of heroic names! But the old Castle standeth still and stern, As some scarred Chief who sends his boys to battle: Hath done so many a time as staidly calm. The gay Hussars come riding through the Town, A light of triumph sparkling in their eyes; The Music goeth shouting in their praise, Like a loud people round the Victor's car; And Highland plumes together nod as though There went the Funeral Hearse of a Russian host: The bickering bayonets flutter wings of fire, And gaily sounds the March o' the Cameron Men. The War-steeds sweepingâmen to battle goingâ The wave of Beauty's handâmeed of her eyesâ The kisses blown from dainty finger-tipsâ The banners with old battle-memories stirredâ The thrilling Pibroch, and the wild war-drum, The stern sword-music of our grand Hurrah, And answering cheer for death or victoryâ All make me tingle with a triumph of life, And I could weep that I am left behind, To see the tide ebb where I may not follow. And there our gallant fellows march afield; To win proud death, or larger life, they leave Home's rosy circle ringed with blessings rich, For the far darkness and the battle-cloud, Where many have fall'n, and many yet must fall In spurring their great hearts up to the leap, For such brave dashes at unconquered heights. The shadow of solemn Sorrow falls behind, Where sobbing Sweethearts look their loving last, Or with tight lips hold in the bursting heart; And weeping Wives lift up the Little Ones. The sun sets in their faces, life grows gray, And sighs of desolation sweep its desert. The winter of the heart aches in the eyes Of Mothers who have given their all, their all. And yet methinks the Heroic Time returns, Such look of triumph lit the meanest face To-day: there seemed no heart so earthy but Had some blind gropings after nobler life, With hands that reached toward God's Gate Beautiful. Our Britain bright'ning through the battle-smoke Has touched them with her glory's lovelier light. And though their darlings fall, and though they die In this death-grapple in the dark with Wrong; The memory of their proud deeds shall not die. They may go down to dust in bloody shrouds, And sleep in nameless tombs. But for all time, Foundlings of Fame are our beloved Lost. For me, this day of glorious life shall be One of the starry brides of Memory, Whose glittering faces light the night o' the soul. DOWN IN AUSTRALIA. Quaff a cup, and send a cheer up for the Old Land! We have heard the Reapers shout, For the Harvest going out, With the smoke of battle closing round the bold Land; And our Message shall be hurled Ringing right across the world, There are true hearts beating for you in the Gold Land. We are with you in your battles, brave and bold Land! For the old ancestral tree Striketh root beneath the sea, And it beareth fruit of Freedom in the Gold Land! We shall come, too, if you call, We shall Fight on if you fall; Shakspeare's land shall never be a bought and sold Land. The standard of the Lord wave o'er the Old Land! For the waiting world holds breath While she treads the den of Death, With the peaceful sleeve stripped up from her bare bold hand; And her rose in blood must bloom On the bosom, and the tomb Of her many Heroes fallen for the Old Land. O, a terror to the Tyrant is that bold Land! He remembers how she stood, With her raiment rolled in blood, When the tide of battle burst upon the Old Land; And he looks with darkened face, For he knows the hero race Strike the Harp of Freedomâdraw her Sword with bold hand. Let thy glorious voice be heard, thou great and bold Land! Speak the one victorious word, And fair Freedom's wandered Bird Shall wing back with leaf of promise from the Old Land; And the people shall come out From their prison with a shout For the spring that greeneth in the Future's Gold Land. When the smoke of Battle rises from the Old Land, You shall see the Tyrant down! You shall see her lifted crown Wears another peerless jewel won with bold hand: She shall thresh her foes like corn, They shall eat the bread of scorn; We will sing her song of triumph in the Gold Land. Quaff a cup, and send a cheer up for the Old Land! We have heard the Reapers shout, For the Harvest going out, Seen the smoke of battle closing round the bold Land; And our answer shall be hurled Ringing right across the world,â All true hearts are beating for you in the Gold Land. FRANCE AND ENGLAND. Like a stern old friend, War grimly comes To the temple of peaceful Life; With the well-known nod of his beckoning plumes, He hurries us into the strife. And we meet once more, in the fields of fate, With our chivalrous Enemy, Who knows, by the grip of our hands in hate, What the strength of our love may be. We have dashed together like waves and rocks! We have fought till our shirts grew red! We have met in the shuddering battle-shocks, Where none but the freed soul fled! Now side by side, in the fields of fate, And shoulder to shoulder, are we; And we know, by the grip of our hands in hate, What the strength of our love may be. Then gather ye, gather to battle, ye Braves, In the might of your old renown! And follow ye, follow ye, over the waves, Where Liberty's sun went down! By the bivouac-fire, in the battle-shower, Remember your destiny grand, To set in the thrones of their future power The peoples of many a land! Till the last fettered nation that calls us is free, Let us fall upon Tyranny's horde! Italy, Poland, and Hungary, see, With their praying hands seek for a Sword. Till the Storm-God is roused in each suffering land, Let us keep the war-standard unfurled! And till Freedom and Faith shall go hand-in-hand, Let us march through the welcoming world. AFTER ALMA. Our old War-banners on the wind Were waving merrily o'er them; The hope of half the world behindâ The sullen Foe before them! They trod their march of battle, bold As death-devoted freemen; Like those Three Hundred Greeks of old, Or Rome's immortal Three Men. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? With towering heart and lightsome feet They went to their high places; The fiery valour at white heat Was kindled in their faces! Magnificent in battle-robe, And radiant, as from star-lands, That spirit shone which girds our globe With glory, as with garlands! Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? They saw the Angel Iris o'er Their deluge of grim fire; And with their life's last tide they bore The Ark of Freedom higher! And grander 'tis i' the dash of death To ride on Battle's billows, When Victory's kisses take the breath, Than sink on balmiest pillows. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? Brave Hearts, with noble feeling flushed, In valour's ruddy riot But Yesterday! how are ye hushed Beneath the smile of Quiet! For us they poured their blood like wine, From life's ripe-gathered clusters; And far through History's night shall shine Their deeds with starriest lustres. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? We laid them not in Churchyard home, Beneath our darling daisies: Where to their grave-mounds Love might come, And sit, and sing their praises. But soothly sweet shall be their rest Where Victory's hands have crowned them To Earth our Mother's bosom pressed, And Heaven's arms around them. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? Yes, there they lie 'neath Alma's sod, On pillows dark and gory,â As brave a host as ever trod Old England's path to glory. With head to home and face to sky, And feet the Tyrant spurning, So grand they look, so proud they lie, We weep for glorious yearning. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? They in Life's outer circle sleep, As each in death stood Sentry! And like our England's Dead still keep Their watch for kin and country. Up Alma, in their red footfalls, Comes Freedom's dawn victorious; Such graves are courts to festal halls! They banquet with the Glorious. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? Our Chiefs who matched the men of yore, And bore our Shield's great burden,â The nameless Heroes of the Poor,â They all shall have their guerdon. In silent eloquence, each life The Earth holds up to heaven; And Britain gives for Child and Wife, As those brave hearts have given. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But, O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? The Spirits of our Fathers still Stand up in battle by us; And, in our need, on Alma hill, The Lord of Hosts was nigh us. Let Joy or Sorrow brim our cup, 'Tis an exultant story, How England's Chosen Ones went up Red Alma's hill to glory. Ah, Victory! joyful Victory! Like Love, thou bringest sorrow; But O! for such an hour with thee, Who could not die to-morrow? BEFORE SEBASTOPOL. At last we grip the Tyrant! Now There's not a heart so lowly But burns to strike a battle-blow, And win a cause so holy! The Brave look fearless in the eyes Of Death, nor cry him quarter; And grand promotion waits them, Boys, Who fall by land or water! To-day the ancient valour starts; The Spirit of old story Shall flash from out heroic hearts, And kindle England's glory. Wild voices wail across the sea,â They cry from many a woe-land,â Revenge! remember Sinope! Revenge! remember Poland! We seek the bed of Death, to win Fair Freedom's dream of beauty, Or wrest her from the Tyrant, in The loving arms of duty. Then gaily through the ocean-foam Will sail our nobler Argo, And proudly to our Island-home Shall bear the precious cargo. Think how their happy eyes will brim To greet us on the beaches, With blissful looks of love that swim Through long luxurious reaches! They watch us now from out the West, But all too proud to sorrow For us who rest on Victory's breast, Or wear her wreath to-morrow. Now, Soldiers, up to conquest stride, Let not one spirit falter: For Victory is your plighted Bride, The breach your solemn altar! Through all this bloody Cemet'ry Behold what seed lies sleeping; God! but thy sun should stand while we Our harvest-field are reaping! Now, Sailors, fight your Ships to-day As Grenville fought the Spaniard! If Battle's bloodiest game they play, Have at them grip-and-poniard. One thrilling shout for England, Ho! Then, naked for the fight, men, Dash in like fire upon the foe, And God defend the Right, men! SCARLETT'S THREE HUNDRED. To horse, trot, gallop, and out with each blade! To-day, Lads, we ride on a dare-devil raid For death, or a halo that never shall fade. Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! An Army o'erhanging us, in the death-hush Massed, like an Avalanche crowded to crush; Up at them, pierce them, ere on us they rush! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! Stick to old Scarlett, Lads! See how he goes In for a near-sighted look at our foes: Faster, men, faster, or singly he'll close! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! Chariots of fire in the dark of death stand, With crowns for the foremost who fall for their land: My God, what a time ere we get hand to hand! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! O the lightning of life! O the thunder of steeds! Saddles are emptied, but nobody heeds; All fighting to follow where Elliott leads. Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! Spring too now, wedge through now, and cleave crest and crown; All one as a mowing-machine, cut them down! For each foe round you strewn now a wreath of renown. Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! There's fear in their faces; they shrink from the shock; They will open the door, only loud enough knock; Keep turning the key, lest we stick in the lock! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! Well done! Soul and steel alike trusty and true! By Thousands they faced our invincible Few; Like sand in a sieve you have riddled them through. Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! Charge back! Once again we must ride the Death-ride, Torn, tattered, but smiling with something of pride: Charge home; out of Hell; gory-grim; glorified! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! One cheer for the living! One cheer for the dead! One cheer for the deed on that hill-side red! The glory is gathered for England's proud head! Dear England for Ever, Hurrah! OUR HEROES. We blessed them for the Battle, who but marched to the Bier; Some were riper for the Bridalâsome were Fathers gray and sere; With a kiss for Child and Wife, some went out in War's red wrack; And to the land that gave us life, who'd grudge to give it back? I had a gallant Brother, loved at home, and dear to meâ I have a mourning Mother, winsome Wife, and Children threeâ He lies with Balaklava's dead. But let the Old Land call, We would give our living remnant, we would follow one and all! We speak a few weak words; but, the great hearts gone to God, They have fought with their Swordsâthey passed over red-wet-shod! While we sat at home, brave laurels for our Land they died to win; And with smiles Valhalla lightens as our Heroes enter in. They bore our banner fearless to the death, as to the fight, They lifted England peerless to the old heroic height. We weep not for the Heroes whom we never more shall see,â Rather weep we were not with our England's noble Chivalry. INKERMAN. 'Twas Midnight ere our Guns' loud laugh at their wild work did cease, And by the smouldering fires of War we lit the pipe of peace. At Four, a burst of Bells went up through Night's Cathedral dark, It seemed so like our Sabbath Chimes, we could but wake, and hark! So like the Bells that call to prayer in the dear land far away; Their music floated on the air, and kissed usâto betray. Our Camp lay on the rainy hill, all silent as a cloud, Its very heart of life stood still i' the Mist that brought its shroud; For Death was walking in the dark, and smiled His smile to see How all was ranged and ready for a sumptuous jubilee. O wily are the Russians, and they came up through the mirkâ Their feet all shod for silence in the best blood of the Turk! While in its banks our fiery tide of War serenely slept, Their subtle serpentry unrolled, and up the hill-side crept. In the Ruins of the Valley do the Birds of Carnage stir? A creaking in the gloom like wheels! feet trampleâbullets whirâ By God! the Foe is on us! Now the Bugles with a start Thrillâlike the cry of a wrongÃ¨d Queenâto the red roots of the heart; And long and loud the wild war-drums with throbbing triumph roll,â A sound to set the blood on fire, and warm the shivering soul. The war-worn and the weary leaped up ready, fresh, and true! No weak blood curdled white i' the face, no valour turned to dew. Majestic as a God defied, arose our little Hostâ All for the peak of peril pushedâeach for the fieriest post! Thorough mist, and thorough mire, and o'er the hill-brow scowling grim, As is the frown of Slaughter when he dreams his dreadful dream. No Sun! but none is needed,âMen can feel their way to fight, The lust of Battle in their faceâeyes filled with fiery light; And long ere dawn was red in heaven, upon the dark earth lay The prophesying morning-red of a great and glorious day. As Bridegroom leaves his wedded Bride in gentle slumbers sealed, Our England slumbered in the West, when her Warriors went a-field. We thought of her, and swore that day to strike immortal blows, As all along our leaguered line the roar of battle rose. Her Banners waved like blessing hands, and we felt it was the hour For a glorious grip till fingers met in the throat of Russian power. And at a bound, and with a sound that madly cried to kill, The Lion of Old England leapt in lightnings from the hill: And there he stood superb, through all that Sabbath of the Sword, And there he slew, with a terrible scorn, his hunters, horde on horde. All Hell seemed bursting on us, as the yelling legions cameâ The Cannon's tongues of quick red fire licked all the hills a-flame! Mad whistling shell, wild sneering shot, with devilish glee went past, Like fiendish feet and laughter hurrying down the battle-blast; And through the air, and round the hills, there ran a wrack sublime As though Eternity were crashing on the shores of Time. On Bayonets and Swords the smile of conscious victory shone, As down to death we dashed the Rebels plucking at our Throne. On, on they came with face of flame, and storm of shot and shellâ Up! up! like heaven-scalers, and we hurled them back to Hell. Like the old Sea, white-lipped with rage, they dash and foam despair On ranks of rock, and what a prize for the Wrecker Death was there! But as 'twere River Pleasaunce, did our fellows take that flood, A royal throbbing in the pulse that beat voluptuous blood: The Guards went down to the fight in gray that's growing gory redâ See! save them, they're surrounded! Leap your ramparts of the dead, And back the desperate battle, for there is but one short stride Between the Russ and victory! One more tug, you true and triedâ The Red-Caps crest the hill! with bloody spur, ride, Bosquet, ride! Down like a flood from Etna foams their valour's burning tide. Now, God for Merrie England cry! Hurrah for France the Grand! We charge the foe together, all abreast, and hand to hand! He caught a shadowy glimpse across the smoke of Alma's fray Of the Destroying Angel that shall blast his strength to-day. We shout and charge together, and again, again, again, Our plunging battle tears its path, and paves it with the slain. Hurrah! the mighty host doth melt before our fervent heat; Against our side its breaking heart doth faint and fainter beat. And O, but 'tis a gallant show, and a merry march, as thus We sound into the glorious goal with shouts victorious! From morn till night, we fought our fight, and at the set of sun Stood Conquerors on Inkermanâour Soldiers' Battle won. That morn their legions stood like corn in its pomp of golden grain! That night the ruddy sheaves were reaped upon the misty plain! We cut them down by thunder-strokes, and piled the shocks of slain: The hill-side like a vintage ran, and reeled Death's harvest-wain. We had hungry hundreds gone to sup in Paradise that night, And robes of Immortality our ragged Braves bedight! They fell in Boyhood's comely bloom, and Bravery's lusty pride; But they made their bed o' the foemen dead, ere they lay down and died. We gathered round the tent-fire in the evening cold and gray, And thought of those who ranked with us in Battle's rough array, Our Comrades of the morn who came no more from that fell fray! The salt tears wrung out in the gloom of green dells far awayâ The eyes of lurking Death that in Life's crimson bubbles playâ The stern white faces of the Dead that on the dark ground lay Like Statues of Old Heroes, cut in precious human clayâ Some with a smile as life had stopped to music proudly gayâ The household Gods of many a heart all dark and dumb to-day! And hard hot eyes grew ripe for tears, and hearts sank down to pray From alien lands, and dungeon-grates, how eyes will strain to mark This waving Sword of Freedom burn and beckon through the dark! The Martyrs stir in their red graves, the rusted armour rings Adown the long aisles of the dead, where lie the warrior Kings. To the proud Mother England came the radiant Victory With Laurels red, and a bitter cup like some last agony. She took the cup, she drank it up, she raised her laurelled brow: Her sorrow seemed like solemn joy, she looked so noble now. The dim divine of distance diedâthe purpled Past grew wan, As came that crowning Glory o'er the heights of Inkerman. NICHOLAS AND THE BRITISH LION. Czar Nicholas called to North and South, âCome, see the World's great show! I will thrust my head in the Lion's mouth,â And he laughed, âHa! Ha! Ho! Ho! I am the Lion-Tamer dreadâ I make the old brute quail!â The Lion he shook his Incredulous head, And wagged his Dubious tail. O the Lion lay down in the pride of his might; 'Twas a brave, magnanimous beast! O the Lion leaped up to his shaggiest height; The lord of a bloody feast! Now hold, now hold, thou desperate man, Or thy braggart cheek may pale; Terror is towering up in his mane, And Vengeance tugs at his tail. Like a statue of Satan, Nick, alas! stood, And chuckled a low lying laugh; âThe world is my Knoutship's whipping-top; Hot blood for wine I quaff!â He called to North, he called to South, âCome, see the old brute quail: I will thrust my head in his mumbling mouth:â The Lion he wagged his tail. He thrust his head in the Lion's mouth: Ho! Ho! but the sport was rare! The Lion smelt blood in the giant's breath, And his clenched teeth held him there. Then he cried, from between the gates of death, With the voice of a Spirit in bale, âNow God-a-mercy on my soul! Does the Lion wag his tail?â Then each one strove to say him Yea, But each one held his breath: There was lightning of hell in the Lion's eyes; His looks communed with Death! The Giant's heart melts like snow in his mouth, His voice is a Woman's wail; Avengers knock at the door of his life, In that lash of the Lion's tail. A low, dread sound, as from underground, Makes ready the realms of the dead; And the Tamer lies tamed on the earth full-length; That is, exceptâa head. And the poor old beast, at whose aspect mild The meanest thing dared rail, Shakes his mane like a Conqueror's bloody plumes, Andâquietly wags his tail. A WAR WINTER'S-NIGHT IN ENGLAND. Wild is the wintry weather! Dark is the night, and cold! Closely we crowd together, For warmth in the family fold. A mute and mighty Shadow flies Across the land on wings of Gloom! And through each Home its awful eyes May lighten with their stroke of doom. Life's light burns dimâwe hold the breathâ All sit stern in the shadow of Death, Around the Household fireâ This Winter's-night in England, Straining our ears for the tidings of War, Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. Oh, talk of Britain's glory;â Oh, sing some brave old song;â Or tell the thrilling story Of her wrestle with the wrong, Till we clutch the spirit-sword for the strife, And into our Rest would rather fall Down Battle's cataract of life, Than turn the white face to the wall. Sing O, for a charge victorious! And the meekest face grows glorious! As we sit by the Household fire, This Winter's-night in England,â Our spirits within us like steeds of War! Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. And oft in silence solemn We peer from Night's dark tent, And see the quivering Column, Like a cloud by lightning rent. For death, how merry they mount and ride! Those swords look keen for their lap of gore! Such Valour leaps out Deified! Such souls must rend the clay they wore! How proud they sweep on Glory's track! So many start! so few come back To sit by the Household fire, On a Winter's-night in England, And with rich tears wash their wounds of War, Where we, Beacon-like, hold our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. We thrill to the Clarion's clangour, We harness for the fight: With the Warrior's glorious anger, We are nobly-mad to smite: No dalliance, save with Hate, hold we, Where Life and Death keep bloody tryst, And all the red Reality Reels on us through a murder-mist! Wave upon Wave rolls Ruin's flood, And the hosts of the Tyrant melt in blood, As we sit by the Household fire, This Winter's-night in England, And our Colour flies out to the music of War, Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. Old England still hath Heroes To wear her Sword and Shield! We knew them not while near us, We know them far afield! Look! how the Tyrant's hills they climb, To hurl our gage in his grim hold! The Titans of the earlier time, Though larger-limbed, were smaller-souled! Laurel, or Amaranth, light their brow! Living or dead, we crown them now, As we sit by the Household fire, This Winter's-night in England; From the white cliffs watching the storm of War; Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. O! their brave love hath rootage In the Old Land, deep and dear, And Life's ripe, ruddy fruitage Hangs summering for them here! And tender eyes, tear-luminous, Melt through the dark of dreamland skies, While, pleading aye for home and us, The heart is one live brood of cries! Old feelings cling! O how they cling! And sweet birds sing! O how they sing Them back to the Household fire, This Winter's-night in England, Where we wait for them weary and wounded from War, Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar! Ah, me! how many a Maiden Will wake o' nights, to find Her tree of life, love-laden, Swept bare in this wild wind! The Bird of bliss, to many a nest, Will come back never, never, never! So many a goodly, gallant crest That waved to victory, low for ever! We pray for them, we fear for them, And silently drop a tear for them, As we sit by the Household fire, This Winter's-night in England, Each life looking out for its own love-star! Beacon-like holding our hearts up higher, For those who are fighting afar. But, there's no Land like England, Wherever that land may be! Of all the world 'tis king-land Crowned, by its Bride, the Sea! And they shall rest in the balmiest bed, Who battle for it, and bleed for it! And they shall be head of the Glorious Dead, Who die in the hour of need for it! And long shall we sing of their deeds divine, In songs that warm the heart like wine, As we sit by the Household fire, On a Winter's-night in England, And the tale is told of this night of War, When we, Beacon-like, held our hearts up higher, For those who were fighting afar. THE MARTYRS' HILL. Sitting in her sorrow lone, Still our Mother makes her moan For the Lost; and to the Martyrs' Hill her thoughts in mourning go. O, that desert of the Dead, Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow! Into glory had they rode When the tide of triumph flowed, Not a tear would we shed for the heroes lying low. But our hearts break for the Dead, In their desolate Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow. Praying breath rose white in air, Eyes were set in a stern stare, Hands were stretched for help that came not as they sank in silence low: Our dear, heroic Dead, Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow. Now the winter snows are gone, And Earth smiles as though the Dawn Had come up from it in flowersâsuch a light of grace doth glow All about our darkened Dead, Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow. But, never, never more, Comes the Spring that will restore To their own love, their own land, the lost ones lying low On the Martyrs' Hill, our Dead Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow. Till with victory God replies, Shall our Battle storm the skies, And our living soldiers think, as they grapple with the foe, Of our perished, peerless Dead, Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of winter snow. Through a hundred battles red, Shall their fame float overhead; Into everlasting flowers shall their martyr memories blow. So we crown our glorious Dead, Who lay down in their Death-Bed, With their Winding-sheet and Wreath of Winter snow. OUR ENGLISH NIGHTINGALE. âYou brave, you bonny Nightingale, You are no summer Bird; Your music sheathes an Army's wail That pierces like a Sword.â All night she sings, dear Nightingale, With breast against the thorn; Her saintly patience doth not fail, She keepeth watch till morn. âAh, sing, you bonniest Bird of God, The night is sad and long; To dying earsâto broken heartsâ You sing an Angel's song!â She sings, she sings, our Nightingale, And weary warrior souls Are caught up into Slumber's heaven, And lapped in Love's warm folds. âO sing, O sing! dear Nightingale, For, at your magic note, Upon Life's sea victoriously The sinking soul will float. O sing, O sing! dear Nightingale, And lure them back again, Whose path is lost and spirit crossed, In dark wild woods of Pain.â She sings, she sings, our Nightingale, She breathes a gracious balm; Her presence breaks the waves of war, She smiles them into calm. She sings, she sings, our Nightingale, Of auld Langsyne and Home; And life grows light, the world grows bright, And blood runs rich with bloom. Day after day her dainty hands Make Life's soiled temples clean, And there's a wake of glory where Her spirit pure hath been. At midnight, through that shadow-land, Her living face doth gleam; The dying kiss her shadow, and The Dead smile in their dream. Brave Bird of Love, in Life's sweet May, She rose up from the feast, To shine above our Banner, Like God's Angel in the East. âBrave Bird of Life, wave healing wings O'er that gray Land o' the Dead; God's heaven lie round you like a shield, Earth's blessings on your head.â The Rose did lift her veil, and blush At her Bower-door like a bride: The shy brown birds came back with Spring, In merry greenwood to hide. But there she sang, our Nightingale, Till War's stern heart grew mild, And, nestling in the arms of Peace, He slumbered like a Child. CATHCART'S HILL. They have died, our true and tried, ere our flag victorious flew O'er the burning battle-hell, we must ride to conquest through. But they died, our Glorified! on the field of their renown; And they died when the pride of the Foeman's power went down. Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, 'tis a famous grave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, the bravest of the Brave. A wind of death was waving, like a flame, the Warrior's plume! Stern in his shroud of fire, the Foe glared from his burning tomb! Victory's shouts were ringing as they flashed from out the strife, To meet God's angels bringing garlands for the Kings of Life. Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, 'tis a famous grave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, the bravest of the Brave! Bear them to that grave in a solemn march and slow, Let Music talk in tears o'er the lost ones lying low; They will sleep calm and deep when the battle-bugles blow; And ye shall build their monument when next ye meet the Foe! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, 'tis a famous grave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, the bravest of the Brave! We quaff our cup o' the Vintage, and from darkened depths arise The bubbles, like the tears that plead in Desolation's eyes; Yet there's glory in our grief,â'tis a glory that shall grow When our sorrow hath no morrow, and 'twas centuries ago. Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, 'tis a famous grave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, the bravest of the Brave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill,âtheir glory from its crest Shall flame, a Terror to the North, a Watch-fire to the West! Cross their hands and lay their brands upon the martial breast, They have won the proud âWell done,â lay them down to their rest. Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, 'tis a famous grave! Bury them on Cathcart's Hill, the bravest of the Brave! THE COALITION AND THE PEOPLE. O suffering people! this is not our fight Who called a holy Crusade for the Right! The Despots' bloody game our Tricksters play, And stake our future chance by chance away. Not Whigs! not Tories! we want English Souls, Through which there yet reverberates and rolls Some echo of old greatness; trusty hands To bear our Banner over Seas and Lands. Our good Ship may be driving on the rocks; We need a Compass, and not Weather-Cocks! We have had Leaders who strode forward all On fire to serve her at their Country's call; Who did not stoop, till blind, for place or pelf, Their whole life burned a sacrifice of Self! Who faced the spirit of the Storm and Strife And with an upward smile laid down their life. But now our Leaders are the coward and cold: The Gnomes whose daylight is a gleam of gold; The Dwarfs who sun them in a Despot's smile; The Quakers who would set our dear green Isle Spinning their Cotton till the Judgment Hour, With Ocean turning round for Water-power. They pander to this Plunderer of the night; Confused their little sense of Wrong and Right, And they would bow our England's forehead down Trustfully in his lap to leave her crown; See her sit weeping where her brave lie dead; Blood on her raiment, ashes on her head. We cannot leave our Land for watch and ward To those who know not what a gem they guard; Who would bind us helpless for the Bird of Blood To swoop on; who would have this famous flood Of English Freedom stagnate till it stink, While reptiles wriggle in their slimy drink, And the frogs reign in darkness; croak all night, And call the Stars false Prophets of the Light. O darkened hearts in Homesteads desolate! O wasted bravery of our vainly great! The Flower of Men fall stricken from behind: The Knaves and Cowards stab us bound and blind. With faces turned from Battle, they went forth: We marched with ours flint-set against the North. They shuffled lest their feet should rouse the dead: We went with Resurrection in our tread. They trembled lest the world might come to blows: We quivered for the tug and mortal close. They only meant a mild hint for the Czar: We would have surfeited his soul with War. While they were quenching Freedom's scattered fires, We kindled memories of heroic Sires. They'd have this grand Old England cringe and pray, âDon't smite me, Kings; but if you will, you may.â We'd make her as in those proud times of old, When Cromwell spoke, and Blake's war-thunders rolled. They on the passing powers of Darkness fawn; With warrior-joy we greeted this red Dawn. To crowned blood-suckers they would bind us slaves, We would be free, or sleep in glorious graves. State-Spiders, Here or There, weave webs alike; These snare the victims, while the others strike. The Dwarfs drag our great Banner in the mire: We ask for Men to bear it high and higher. O stop their fiddling over War's grim revel, And pitch them from your shoulders toâthe Devil. ALL OVER. Fades the New Aurora That so glorious shone afar; We but saw its fair face smiling In the ruddy waves of war. The Peace-fool to his pillow Now may sneak, and sleep: But a glory gone for ever, We must weep; let us weep. Sleep the buried thunders; Their reverberations cease: And the grim old War-God Must smileâa painted Peace. Wild eyes are mad-house windows Of Souls that plead in vain! Over their old dark sorrow Greeneth the soft spring-rain. Had we struck for Freedom One immortal battle-blow, Like the men who rose for England, Two hundred years ago,â The dead Nations lying Where they fought and fell of old, Would have risen from their prison With their buried flags unrolled. Cowards in the Council! Heroes in the field! Is our short sad story By the blood of Martyrs sealed. On those lone Crimean ridges In the night our dead arise; Hear the Norland winds come wailing With their curses, and their cries! Sublime in all her suffering; In the fight so brave! Poor old England's victories Bow her to the grave. And is the world to see her Low and lonely lie Chained to her rock, while Tyrants mock, As they go riding by? ENGLAND AND LOUIS NAPOLEON. There was a poor old Woman once, a daughter of our nation, Before the Devil's portrait stood in ignorant adoration. âYou're bowing down to Satan, Ma'am,â said some Spectator civil: âAh, Sir, it's best to be polite, for we may go to the Devil.â Bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. So England hails the Saviour of Society, and will tarry at His feet, nor see her Christ is he who sold him, cursed Iscariot. By grace of God, or sleight of hand, he wears the royal vesture, And at thy throne, Divine Success! we kneel with reverent gesture, And bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. O when the Sun is over us, we venerate the sunlight; But when Eclipse is over it, we venerate the dunlight. No matter what is uppermost, upon All-fours we revel, And when Hell triumphs over Heavenâconciliate the Devil, And bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. Ah, Louis, had you come to us despisÃ¨d and rejected, You might have gone toâCoventry, unnoticed and neglected: But as you've done one Nation so, and left another undone, We kiss you Sire at Windsorâcrown you more than king in London, And bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. Our Idol's hands are red with blood, with blood his eyes are sodden, But we know 'tis only guilty blood which he has spilt and trodden! He wears the imperial purple now, that plotting Prince of evil; He lets us share his glory if we bow down to the Devil; And we bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. With hand to hilt, and ear to earth, waits Revolution, breathless, To catch the resurrection-sound of Liberty the deathless! We see no Danger hug us roundâno Sword hang o'er us gory, While to this mocking Mirage in the sunset of our glory We bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. Back, back, you foolish Peoples, slink into your weeping places, Quench Freedom's torch in tears, and put her light out in your faces: The heart of England beats no more to the old heroic level; The poor old Woman bows before her Portrait of the Devil. Bow, bow, bow: We may go to the Devil, so it's just as well to bow. THE OLD FLAG. An Emperor babbled in his dreams,â Ne'er sleeps the secret in his soul,â âThe Lion is old, and ready he seems To draw my Chariot to its goal.â With awful light the Lion's eye Began to flameâsublime he stands! With looks that make the Tyrant try To hide his bloody hands. Thank God, the advancing tide is met! Thank God, the Old Flag's flying yet. We love our Native Land and Laws, And He would rather we did not! We are Conspirators because We are in our little green grass plot! But let him follow up his frown, Marshal his Myriads for the blow; Those who are doomed to drown must drown, The rest we take in tow! In Cherbourg's sight their Gallows set Beside the Old Flag flying yet. Our Ghost of Greatness hath not fled At crowning of the Gallic Cock; A foreign Despot's heel shall tread No print upon our English rock. Here Freedom by the Lion grand Sits safe, and Una-like doth hold Him gently with her gentle hand; And long as Seas enfold, High on our topmost heights firm-set, We keep her Old Flag flying yet. To Freedom we must aye be true; Our England must be Freedom's home; For sake of our dead Darlings who Went heavenward crowned with martyrdom. 'Twas She who made us what we are, Throned on our Sea-cliffs gray and grand; Great image of majestic care; Fair Bride of Fatherland! We do but pay the filial debt To keep her Old Flag flying yet. This little Isle is Freedom's Bark That rideth in a perilous path: Around us one wide sea of dark That beats and breaks in stormy wrath. The Despots drove poor Freedom forth, By bloody footprints tracked her road;â And Homeless, Homeless, else on earth She takes to her Sea-abode! She turns on us her eyes tear-wet; Ah, keep the Old Flag flying yet. Statesmen have drawn back meek and mute, Or pardon begged from bullying foes, Whene'er a Military boot Was stamped upon retreating toes. They shrink to hear Him at our gates, This ominous thing of gloom and gore, Though Revolution for him waits At Danger's every door. But little do we heed his threat! We keep the Old Flag flying yet. Over the praying Peoples rolled The dark tide, and we helped them not. Yet on our lifted hands, behold, We cry, behold no bloody spot! This famous people's heart is sound, It fights for all that bleed and smart; Weâbanned aboveâmeet underground, Meet in a touch of heart. We cannot our old fame forget; We keep the Old Flag flying yet. We have a true and tender clasp For Freedom's friends where'er their home, And for her foes as grim a grasp, No matter when or whence they come. We like that gay light-hearted France That into stormy splendour breaks, When its brave music for the dance Of Death the battle makes; And foot to foot would proudly set To keep the Old Flag flying yet. But what is France? this cruel Power That builds above her martyred dead, Whose spirits thicken hour by hour The air about its doomÃ¨d head? This Death-in-Life throned on the grave, That in the darkness waits its prey? Like Coral-workers 'neath the wave, It dies on reaching day. The Sun of France hath not thus set, But, keep the Old Flag flying yet. France, who hath stood erect and first, Will not lie latest in the dust: Ere long her breath of scorn will burst This bubble blown of bloody lust. Quietly, quietly turns the tide, And when this shore lies black and bare, There shall be no more sea to hide The Wrecker's secrets there. Our lot is cast, our task is set, To keep the Old Flag flying yet. Save him? this Burglar of the night Broke into Freedom's sacred shrines! This Lie uncrowned whene'er the light Of merciless next morning shines! This terror of a land struck dumb, Who fed the Furies with brave blood! We cannot save him when they come For his. Not if we would. Too slippery is the hand blood-wet! Ah, keep the Old Flag flying yet. The Tyrant sometimes waxeth strong To drag a fate more fearful down: He veileth Justice who ere long Shall see Eternal Justice frown. The Kings of Crime from near and far Shall come to crown him with their crown; Under the Shadow of Doom his Star Will redden, and go down. And day shall dawn when it hath set; Ah, keep the Old Flag flying yet. Leaves fall, but lo! the young buds peep! Flowers die and still their seed shall bloom; From death the quick young life will leap When Spring comes breathing by the tomb. And though their graves are hushed, in stern Heroic dream the dead men lie! To God their still white faces turn: The Murdered do not die. Will God the Martyrs' seed forget? No. Keep the Old Flag flying yet. This triumph of the Spoken word Is well, my England, but give heed, The World leans on thee as a Sword For Freedom in her battle-need. Star of a thousand battles red, Be thou the Beacon of the Free! Turn round thy luminous side, and shed God's light o'er land and sea. Through floods, or flames, or bloody sweat, Keep thou the Old Flag flying yet. The splendid shiver of brave blood Is thrilling through our England now! She who so often hath withstood The Tyrants, lifts her brightened brow. God's precious charge we proudly keep In circling arms of victory! With Freedom we shall live, or sleep With our dear Dead who are free. God forget us when we forget To keep the Old Flag flying yet. ENGLAND AND LOUIS NAPOLEON. May, 1859. Majestic Mother! Thine was not a brow To bend, and blindly take a tinsel Crown From hands like His. Thy glorious Sons have won More crowns than thou canst wear, though all the year A fresh one glistened daily. These are crowns Untarnishable by the breath of scorn! The crowns that never can be melted down And minted for the market. Thine was not A soul to wear the fetters that made fast His stolen throne to him, and gracefully To drape the Imperial Purple round, and hide The blood that splashed there, red till Judgment Day. He stole on France, deflowered her in the night, Then tore her tongue out lest she told the tale; And Statesmen called him friend, and proudly held Our Banner over him, while moneyed worldlings, So pleased they knew not on which leg to stand, Went on their knees, and worshipped his success,â So prostrate in their souls, so prone in dust, They saw not how the feet were only clay, For all the golden Image; they forgot How meanest reptiles crawl up tallest towers. Our England is long-suffering, and slow Of judgment, lulled by seeming to the last. And they are busy dreaming their dark dreams, While she is sleeping sound in trustful peace. 'Tis well for thee, my Country, when the day Breaks, thou canst never match them in the dark! Thine eyes are blind where Birds of night see best. But instinct, that Veiled Prophet of the Soul, Flashes up, startled from its seeing trance, As though God's hand had touched it while we slept. There's some invisible danger drawing near, That hath not taken shape yet, but it comes. The still small voice cries wake, my Country, wake, And sleep no more while that Man's in the world. The treacherous dealer will deal treacherously; The lawless Power is still above all Law! The Foe that cometh at the dead of night May find the Goodman slumbering with the arms Too rusted on the walls. Make the Sword sharp; Watch warily, you lookers from the hill! Arm every rampart, rock, and tower of Right, And arm the people; thus, securely armed, We may sit safe and hold the hands of War In ours, he cannot strike us for the time. Once more the War-wave surges gaily out From Paris with its gallant armaments, In music's pomp, and bannered pride, and dance Of life light-hearted, and light-headed crests. The Ghost of BuonapartÃ¨ hath broken loose With Ruin's lighted torch half hidden in The Devil's own dark lanthorn. We shall see The night-side of Napoleon, as he tracks His old earth foot-prints black with rusted blood. Alas for Italy! the Storm of War From its fire-mountain throne sweeps burning down, Its purple lava-mantle trails behind, Embracing all and blasting all it folds. A sea of soldiery breaks over her; Her fair face darkens in the shadow of Swords; Destruction drives his ploughshare through her soil, But will he turn her old lost Jewel to light? Another crop of young heroic life Is ready for the Reaper; it springs fast In such a land, so watered, with such blood. Poor Fools! this Despot turned Deliverer is A sneaking Cutpurse, not a Cutthroat grand, Like him that lifted up a Sword of fire, Whose flashes frightened nations, and went forth, A prairie-flame consuming men as grass: How dazzlingly his beacon-star that danced From crown to crown did shine above the lands He covered with his purple and his pall! He stormed the dizziest heights, and there he stood In sanguine glory! Like a Battle-God Ruling the strife with face of marble calm! The eyes of Heaven that look down on us with The earnestness of all eternity, Saw our old world turn blood-red mirroring Him! Napoleon dilated till he filled The vision of France instead of Liberty. And such the glamour of his grandeur, She Knew not which Image crowned the Column lifted A heaven above her, in her love and worship. But this Man leads her eyeless, blind in blood. He bears a Burglar's Bludgeon, not a Sword: Great Oath-breaker, and not World-Victor He. How far the tide may flood, how quick return With wreck and ruin for its freightage home, We know not, nor how soon the nether pit May open and stern Nemesis rise up For vengeance infinitely terrible! As in the grim Norse myth Loke lieth bound Down at the heart o' the world, so Tyranny keeps A potent spirit fettered underground, And o'er it hangs a Serpent horrible, With eyes through which all hell crowds up to see The poison-fire spit in that Spirit's face; In straining waves it writhes along to squeeze Its soul of venom into every drop: And there sits Wife-like Patience at the side, Catching the poison till her cup will hold No more, and she must empty it. Ah then The poison burns! and with one great heart-heave That Spirit's bonds are burst! an Earthquake's born. These Despots do but throw with loaded dice; They lose or win by other will than theirs! A Goddess blind leads worshippers as blind. Henceforth we have no part in this man's lot, No faith in him; he goes his way, we ours: If we were true to him we must be false To all our dearest deeds and noblest dreams! We are no close-chained Mob for one to walk Over our heads, and kiss the feet that tread! Our welding oneness binds up all our wounds, And one heart and one breath make healing life. We trust in God, and mean to hold our own. We are not stainless; there are wrongs on wrongs Crying for Right! the patient heavens have looked On many a failing sadly! England's Star Hath winked on many a crime, and through the gloom Suffering still doggeth Sin, to strike at last. May God forgive us, we are apt to grow Unmindful of our blessings, and forget That this is England, and forget how He Hath wrought for England; that the sacred Ark Rests on this Ararat; we dare not face The world with that same faith we dare profess Kneeling to God. And so at times we need A hint from Heaven, and these are often stern. May God forsake not England, but in need Look smilingly upon her! We at least Will never run beside this Tyrant's car Of triumph, glorying in the dust we raise! Our voice at least shall cry aloud his fall, Though but a lonely trumpet in the night, And spare not him who plots against us all. O Statesmen, ye who lead this noble land, May you prove wise and worthy! Great good Men, With hearts that beat to high heroic measures, And strength still equal to the sternest time; With faith to fight and patience to work on, Still knowing these live longer than a Lie! The pyramid of our power is not complete Until it touches heaven for its crown! And if the Bloody Star should turn this way Its red eye of destruction, fierce to see The pride and prowess of our might go down With England for funereal pyre; then give No quarter to the foes that aim at us! Through fire and foam flash on them, and strike home Like Lightnings of the Lord! fuel the flames Of Battle with the Revolution's wrecks That drift upon our shores. In Tyrant-land A young Deliverer lies a-dream, and sees Such splendours in his vision only eyes When veiled can look on! tell him the time's come! He will arise and stretch his hand and snatch The Sword. It will be Resurrection Day! The Tyrant's fortresses and palaces Built with the Headsman's scaffold will dissolve; The piles of ghastly, gory heads shall turn To flaming-sworded Spirits! the dry bones Will stir and rise up, and the Dead shall live. You Lovers of our England, do but look On this dear Country over whose fair face God drooped a bridal veil of tender mist, That she might keep her beauty virginal, And He might see her through a softer glory; So very meek and reverent doth she stand Within this shadow soft of Love Divine, More lovable, and not as brighter lands Whose bolder beauty stares up in heaven's face. Look on her now, this jewel of the world, Set in that marriage-ring of circling sea! She smiles upon her Image in its calm, Like some proud Ship that floateth in its shadow. And as a happy Lover clasps his Bride, The fond Sea folds her round, and his brimmed life Runs rippling to her inmost heart of hearts, Until it swims a-flood with happiness; And all the waters of her love leap back To him exultant from a thousand hills. From his salt virtue comes her northern sweetness. How his rough kisses make her roses bloom! Once in his rousÃ¨d wrath he lifted up A mighty Armada in his arms, and dashed It into sea-drift at his Mistress' feet. And still he threatens with his voice of storms The plots of all Invaders; still he keeps Eternal watch around. How proud in peace, The wild white horses rear and foam along And bring to her the Harvests of the world! How grand in war they bear her battle-line In strength half-smiling, perfect Power crowned With careless grace, which seemeth to all eyes The plume of Triumph nodding as it goes; For visible victory sits upon her brow, And shines upon her sails. See where She sits Holding at heart her noble dead, and nursing Her living Children on the old brave virtue; Wearing the rainy radiance of the morning, With silver sweetness swimming in her tears, Feeling the glory rippling down from heaven, With smiles from all her wild flowers, her green leaves, And nooks where Old Times live their Shepherd ways. We cannot count her heroes who lay down In quiet graveyards when their work was done; But mound on mound they rise all over the land To bar a Tyrant's path, and make his feet To stumble like the blind man among tombs. Her brave dead make our earth heroic dust; Their spirit glitters in our England's face And makes her shine, a Star in blackest night, Calm at her heart, and glory round her head. We think of all who fought, and who are now Immortals in the heaven of her love; The Martyrs who have made of burning wrongs Their fiery chariot, and gone up to God; The saintly Sorrows that now walk in white; Till faces bloom like battle-Banners flushed All over with most glorious memories. We are a Chosen People; Freedom wears Our English Rose for her peculiar crest, Whoso dares touch it bleeds upon the thorn! It may be that the time will come again For one more desperate struggle to the death. The eye of Evil on our England looks With snaky sparkle still. It may be they Will rouse the old Berserkir rage, and make The vein of wrath throb livid on her brow, And wake the grim Norse War-dog in her blood, Until she springs afloat upon the sea Like an Immortal white-winged on the air, The joy of swiftness lightning through her veins. Thrice hath our England swept the Seas, and cleared Her Ocean-path, the Highways of the world, And will again if Robbers lie in wait. She hath stood fast when towering Nations hurled In one vast wave their culminating power! Through all that harvest-day of bloody death, They charged in vain, and dashed upon the edge Of her red sword, and fell, at Waterloo! We kept the shamble-slopes of Inkerman! Through blood and fire and gloom of Indian War We swam the Red Sea, and rode out the storm! So shall we hold our own dear land with all The old unvanquished soul, and we shall see Their changing Empires shift like sand around The Island Rock, the footstool of the Lord, Where Freedom also lays her head, and rest In calm or storm the best hopes of a world. Ah, let the Peacemen preach, but let our Peace Be Peace white-robed and not white-livered Peace; Be Right victorious, not triumphant Wrong! These pallid Peacemen are to true men what Our world might be without its Iron Ore; But never may the grand old bravery die. No, no! we must not let the death-fires dance Along our heights with their funereal flames, As Hell had thrust up many red-hot tongues To get its lap of gore when earth is drenched. Our green fields shall not blush in blood for us! We will not let them pluck the old land down To throne them in her seat; they must not wear The Crown she raced for round the world and won. Our Country has a name and fame might fill The eyes of Hate and Envy with tame tears; And they shall never lay her low while we Are true to her in heart and head and hand. And all who come in peace will find a home, And all who come in war a mouthful of Our dust in death, and Sea-beach for a grave. Great starry thoughts grow luminous in the dark; The Bird of Hope soars singing overhead! We cannot fear for England, we can die To do her bidding, but we cannot fear: We who have heard her thunder-roll of deeds Reverberating through the centuries; By battle fire-light had the stories told; We who have seen how proudly she prepared For sacrifice, how radiantly her face Flashed when the Bugle blew its bloody sounds, And bloody weather fluttered her old Flag; We who have seen her with the red heaps round; We who have known the mightiest Powers dashed back Broken from her impregnable sea-walls; We who have learned how in the darkest hour The greatest light breaks out, and in the time Of trial she reveals her noblest strength; We do not, will not, cannot fear for Her, We who have felt her big heart beat in ours. Hail to Thee, Mother of Nations! mighty yet To strive, or suffer, and give overthrow! For all the Powers of nature fight for thee. Spirits that sleep in glory shall awake, Come down and drive thy Car of victory Over thine enemies' necks. Thy past renown Shall turn to future strength. Long will they wait Who privily lurk to stab thee when the Night Shall cover all in darkness. Dear old Land, Thy shining glories are no Sunset gleams, But clouds that kindle round some great new Dawn! LOUIS NAPOLEON:ââÃ BERLIN.â Because his Dream so gloomily dips His Soul in the shadow of coming Eclipse, With a tremulous clutch the Sword he grips! Because the Crown felt loose on his head, And his Throne grew shaky, once more he would tread Secure with his foot on the face of the dead. Because the flash of the breakers by night Showed him Destruction so near that the white Of its eyes made sick the Seer's sight! Because the Heavens waxed weary of him, Oceans of innocent blood must brim, That his poor little Lad might be learning to swim! Because his Boy needed Baptism of fire, There is service of hell in a Funeral Pyre Of Towns aflame with its heavenward spire! Because he had Murder's new Toy to try, A hundred thousand men must die; We hold our breath as the Doomed goes by, Dark with the shadow of fate on his soul; And the storm-winds rise, and the war-clouds rollâ Avengers that hurry him on to his goal! If he saw what I see, that Dreamer gone fey Would double himself in the dust to pray. Napoleon! this is the Judgment Day! MÃLTKE'S PROMISE. If only fourteen days are mine To make all ready, I know The French will never see our Rhine And we shall take their rhino; Napoleon will strike too late, And ere his FÃªte-day meet his fate, That will not tarry though he wait! THE MITRAILLEUSE AT SAARBRÃCKEN. What sound was that we heard? great God of Battles! It was the Empire having the death-rattles. A GRAVE ERROR. He trampled Freedom underfoot; Amid her murdered dead struck root; He made their tomb his place of trust! And now the blood hath turned to rust; The Dead men crumble into dust: His power sinks in that burial-place, And He is caught in their embrace! THE FAITH OF THE PHILISTINE. The great Deceiver finds himself deceived: France's bereaver is of France bereaved: And England, half converted by his fall, Thinks there's a God who governs after all! This is the faith o' the British Philistine; Failure is damnable; Success divine. PEACE-AT-ANY-PRICE MEN. You Seven Wise Men of Gotham, who could vote That England in your bowl must sink or float, You sorely need a Tonic of Cold Steel, Who to the Beasts of Prey for Peace would kneel! Malingerers who can basely maim the might Of Manhood, and would rather die than fight. The fear, for Self, makes Cowards, for others, bold: And love of Country's sapped by lust of Gold. You, poor white-livered bastards of our race To rouse some English colour in your face, Must you on either coward cheek be smitten, Or have the blood fetched back to them flea-bitten? Gnash your pale lips for shame! and let the bite For a moment hide the coward out of sight. Alas! nor bite would bring, nor blow could start, True English blood where there is none at heart. But, we are Peacemen, also; crying for Peace, peace, at any priceâthough it be War! We must live free, at peace, or each man dies With death-clutch fast for ever on the prize. THE SECOND EMPIRE. It had not life enough to die at last, Nor weight enough to fall; it simply passed: A Shadow great calamity had cast. Gone, like a dance of gnats from sunset streams! We saw it, with these eyes; and now it seems Dim as a fragment of forgotten dreams. A mist of blood, it rose up in the night; A mist of glamour blurred the common light; A mist of lies, it vanishes from sight. For Eighteen years we watched where'er life stirred; Waited and listened, but we never heard God speak. It went without a warning word! One flash of Heaven; and all the Pageantry Of Cloudland crumbles; all the EphemerÃ¦ flee From the still presence of Eternity! One ray of risen Liberty hath shone, And like a name writ in the Sighs breathed on A Prison Window-pane, the Empire's gone. A PLEA FOR THE REPUBLIC. You have delivered our afflicted earth Of that Napoleonic After-birth, Begot of horrible rape and hideous wrong, With which abortion France hath travailed long; But do not bleed to death a gallant nation Suffering the CÃ¦sarean operation! Burn out of earth all record of his hand: Right to the soul of us efface the brand! Let all men see that Paris hath arisen To erect her throne on ruins of her prison! Each beauty blast that decked her as his Slave; But do not bury us in the Empire's grave. You came with Resurrection in your tread! Was it for Second death you woke the dead? You rolled the Gravestone of the Soul away, Is it to thrust us deeper from the day, Because you were so wronged, while we were bound Blind in a dungeon, worse than underground? His Slaves, his Hirelings, shouted for the war, But we went chained to CÃ¦sar's battle-car; Dumb for the sacrifice, were safely gagged, And in his dust-cloud to the conflict dragged. We voted âYes,â but that the Tyrant knew Meant liberty at home, not war with you. Ah, do not bid our young Republic die! Now you have rooted out the cancerous Lie, And freed us from the curse that drained our blood And spirit more than all your battle could; Do not put out our struggling, only light, Whereby we still distinguish wrong from right. We offer you a Conquest, loftier yet Than any you have reached with hands red-wet; Or any you can win, e'en though we stood And slew and slew till both were blind with blood; Our little fields made one vast heaving tomb; All heaven one black pall of smoking gloom. O, Men! is it not shame enough that we Have suffered wrongs so great, so helplessly: So past all common signs of wrong for years Of wrong too deep for wordsâtoo stern for tears? Think how we were betrayed by Him who hath made Our streets straight; cleared them for your Cannonade! We can but rise up from the dust to kneel; Trying to gain our feet once more we feel What hurts we got when downâknocked out of breath, Kneeled on, heart-crushed, and knuckled nigh to death; As some poor Madman, who hath dropped and swooned, Is maimed where none can see his mortal wound. Be generous, Germans! we will take the print Of kindness deeper than the fierce sword-dint; A wounded Nation watchesâwaits to see The advent of your Red-cross Chivalry: As the dark spirit of the passing Storm Springs up divine, and lo! the Rainbow's form! We hail you, Brothers, who have broke our bands; As Brothers we stretch forth to you our hands: Brothers beside you we would freely march In peace, beneath glad heaven's triumphal arch: As Brothers we have Our great part to play When Kings and Emperors have passed away! LOUIS NAPOLEON AND SOME COCKNEY WORKING-MEN. Slaves that make Tyrants recognize their own. Safe at the heart of you they have their Throne And wave the Banner that will not go down; Your blindness is an everlasting Crown; The self-forged fetters of the Soul are yours; You make a Dungeon of all Out-of-doors! Your mind is just the mould that will re-cast The Image Godâthe great Iconoclastâ For ever breaks. The Tyrant lifted o'er ye Is but the Slave's own self seen in its glory, And this Man, most abjectly fallen, will Be Emperor of Snobs and Flunkeys still. The Seaweed on our shore's securely tossed, But there's a Nation wrecked. What of the Lost? Poor France, that from the Imperial fetters freed, Tears at her flesh they chafed so till it bleed, France must be smelted in the fires of War, To rid her of His image stamped on her,â He who coined her in his likeness, sealed her shame, Branding her with his features and his name. This is your Hero! let me ope your dim Dust-blinded eyes, for one true look at him! To conquer Europe, bid all fears to cease, As Emperor he proclaimed his Empire Peace. The Eagle that he mounted was the tame Dirt-draggled fowl of Boulogne; not the same Old Bird of glory, with its wings of flame, That perched on all the Pinnacles of Fame. And yet, 'tis at your peril you believe Those who are truthful only to deceive! He found a troubled world would doubt his word. At lengthâfull lengthâhe drew the famous sword Of FranceâNapoleon's sword. Ex-calibre! To prove, in deed, the Empire was not War: Then flung away its scabbard: rushed to meet The Foe, andâlaid the weapon at his feet. From Coup d'Ãtat to Coup de GrÃ¢ce you see The Empire was not Warâ'twas Butchery. Nature but made him a Conspirator, Not General. She is answerable for A great empiric: not an Emperor. He should have kept his secret safe and far From the stern lightning-eyes of searching War. His place was not the front of battle, where In slaying one another men play fair; Safe in the rear it was his rÃ´le to stand, With dagger and dark-lantern in his hand, And strike at unarmed captives from behind, And only strike at such as he could bind. He should have throttled France again by night Quietly, while she slept, without a fight! Behind his Mitrailleuse he might have slunk, And massacred once more with soldiers drunk. Why come forth in the light to let us see The immeasurable incapacity? Why drop the midnight mask, knowing so well His nothingness if not inscrutable? Why daze himself by dayâlook like a stark- Blind foolâwith such a genius for the dark? He must not be stamped out, now he is down, Even though the Sword, into the War-scale thrown, Be followed by his Sceptre and his Crown. He must not slink from sight! When he is dead, Take him, O Earth! like those half-buriÃ¨d And wholesale-murdered in Montmartre, with head Exposed, to be identified with dread. Outside Time's travelling Show, let him be seen As Fieschi on the throne, with his Machine, Firing at Freedomâgrinding on that grim Gun-barrel-organ, turned to war by him,â Making infernal music for the dance Of Death: the flight in which he led poor France. A figure so grotesque, such cause must give For horror, as will earn its right to live! And You, who are supposed our blood to share, Unworthy of the English name you bear, You mob his gates, you wag the tail, and stand, Proud to be patted by him, and lick his hand; Lickspittles (He was spat forth by his land), Mouth-watering with the slaver of the slave! (A different licking German freemen gave). Good friend of France? He made her flourish? So Heat without light will make the fungi grow; He puffed her up as creatures of decay Raise the Oak-galls that eat the life away. He sapped her, made her rotten to the root, And, at the breath of War, down fell the fruit. Good friend of England he could never be Who was born-natural foe to Liberty. Get up, go home, be henpecked by your Wives And sat on the remainder of your lives; The âevilâ that you suffer from is such As is not cured by any Royal touch. If Hell grew sick, and heaved the Devil out, Fools, on all-fours, like you, would fawn and shout Congratulations on his glorious reign, And wish him joy in making Hell again. THE TWO NAPOLEONS. One shook the world with Earthquake. Like a fiend He sprang exultantâall hell following after! The Other, in burst of bubble and whiff of wind, Shook the world too,âwith laughter! The One out-wearied wingÃ¨d Victory! So swift he went, his Spirit would out-fly her; The Other wore her out with waiting; he So failed to keep up by her! One bitted France like some wild beast; and when He had mounted, reined and rode until he tamed it; The Other threw it down by stealth, and then Most infamously maimed it. The First at least a splendid Meteor shone! The Second fizzed and fell, an aimless rocket; Kingdoms were pocketed for France by one, The other picked her pocket. Such as it was, Napoleon gave her all The dazzle of his glory to bedeck her! The other spread his gloom for a funeral Pall, Like Glory's Undertaker. That showed the Sphinx in front, with Lion-paws, Cold lust of death in the sleek face of her,â This the turned, cowering tail and currish claws, And hindermost disgrace of her. In the eyes of France, one shook down showers of stars As jewels for her breast; this breaks her heartâa Vain dream to think of BuonapartÃ¨'s Wars Without your BounapartÃ¨. One took the World as 'twere his natural throne, And God Himself had crowned him at its portal! But for his Second-Hand Napoleon The Lie had been immortal. That was a living thing, whose Shadow made The heart of Nations shiver; This was never More than the shadow of a Dead man's Shade The world shakes off for ever. THE ABOLITIONIST TO HIS BRIDE. Sad I come for thy caresses, bonny bride, bonny bride, For my nestling brow is bound with crown of thorn; And the more thy leal heart presses, bonny bride, bonny bride, Is thy true and tender bosom pierced and torn. I have gloomed thy girlish gladness, bonny bride, bonny bride, Made thee tearful in thy Wifehood's dewy dawn, Given thy voice a soul of sadness, bonny bride, bonny bride, Set thy dainty cheek's ripe beauty waxing wan. The wild light of 'wildered sorrows, bonny bride, bonny bride, Is the lustre that comes flashing to thine eyes, As of hopes that know no morrows, bonny bride, bonny bride, Or from sunken suns that set no more to rise. My poor heart hath put on mourning, bonny bride bonny bride, For the death of sweet and saintly Liberty; It was down the Traitor's Turning, bonny bride, bonny bride, That they smote her in the Country of the Free. Where the Ark of Freedom rested, bonny bride, bonny bride, When the May-Flower rode out bravely o'er the Flood; Where the Bird of Freedom nested, bonny bride, bonny bride, In the land our Fathers bought with precious blood. They have broken every promise, bonny bride, bonny bride, False as hell to League, and Covenant, and vow;â Torn the Babes of Freedom from us, bonny bride, bonny bride, Grim as Herod! and like Herod they shall bow. In the mire our Banner's trailing, bonny bride, bonny bride; It but symbols bloody stripes and bitter tears, To a world of Tyrants hailing, bonny bride, bonny bride, And a world of Slaves that groans, a Hell that cheers. Our good Bark is heavily wearing, bonny bride, bonny bride, And the hungry sharks they track us through the sea, With their cruel keen eyes glaring, bonny bride, bonny bride, For the burial of embalmÃ¨d Liberty. How the darkness round us presses, bonny bride, bonny bride! By the dying watch-fire hearts sit dark and dumb; And we strain and make blind guesses, bonny bride, bonny bride, Of the morning and the morrow that shall come. O, 'twill be a fearful waking, bonny bride, bonny bride, Should the faces of our Brothers dawn in view, With the light above us breaking, bonny bride, bonny bride, And the earth beneath us wet with crimson dew. We are weak, and win derision, bonny bride, bonny bride, All too weak to crush the Serpents that we clasp; But I see in solemn vision, bonny bride, bonny bride, The young Heroes who shall kill them in their grasp. See the Flag of Freedom dancing, bonny bride, bonny bride, On the Fortresses and Ruins of old Wrongâ See the Slave's proud eyes up-glancing, bonny bride, bonny bride, With the heart that breaks no more, save into song. See the hills of earth that whiten, bonny bride, bonny bride, With the feet of angels coming down to men! See the homes of earth that brighten, bonny bride, bonny bride, With the beautiful that vanished, come again. There's a long road, wild and dreary, bonny bride, bonny bride, Through the winding ways of Sorrow's Wilderness! And a-many will fall weary, bonny bride, bonny bride, And but few the honeyed Land of Promise press. Yet we'll battle on with bravery, bonny bride, bonny bride, We will battle on as sabbathless as Doom; We shall leave the land of Slavery, bonny bride, bonny bride, And the Victor's wreath will crown the Martyr's tomb. 1855. AN IMPERIAL REPLY. 'Tis glorious, when the thing to do, Is at the supreme instant done! We count your first fore-running few A thousand men for every one! For this true stroke of Statesmanshipâ The best Australian Poem yetâ Old England gives your hand the grip, And binds you with a coronet, In which the Gold o' the Wattle glows With Shamrock, Thistle, and the Rose. They talked of England growing old: They said she spoke with feeble voice; But hear the virile answer rolled Across the world! Behold her Boys Come back to her full-statured Men, To make four-square her fighting ranks. She feels her youth renewed again, With heart too full for aught but âThanks!â And now the Gold o' the Wattle glows With Shamrock, Thistle, and the Rose. âMy Boys have come of age to-day,â The proud old Mother smiling said. âThey write a brand-new page to-day, By far-off futures to be read!â Throughout all lands of British blood, This stroke hath kindled such a glow; The Federal links of Brotherhood Are clasped and welded at a blow. And aye the Gold o' the Wattle glows With Shamrock, Thistle, and the Rose. Sydney, 1885. THE BOY'S RETURN. Wives, Mothers, Sweethearts sent Their dearest; waved their own defenders forth; And, fit companions for the bravest, went The Boys, to test their manhood, prove their worth As Sons of those who braved All dangers; to Earth's ends our Flag unfurled,â The old Pioneers of Ocean, who have paved Our Pathway with their bones around the world! To-day the City waits, Proudly a-thrill with life about to be: She welcomes her young warriors in her Gates Of Glory, opened to them by the Sea. Let no cur bark, or spurt Defilement, trying to tarnish this fair fame; No Alien drag our Banner through the dirt Because it blazons England's noble name. Upon the lips of Praise They lay their own hands, sayingââWe have not won Great battles for you, nor Immortal bays, But what your Boys were given to do is done!â When Clouds were closing round The Island-home, our Pole-star of the North, Australia fired her Beaconsârose up crowned With a new dawn upon the ancient earth. For us they filled a cup More rare than any we can brim to them! The patriot-passion did so lift men up, They looked as if each wore the diadem! Best honours we shall give, If to that loftier outlook still we climb; And in our Unborn Children there shall live The larger spirit of this great quickening time. To-day is the Women's day! With them there's no more need o' the proud disguise They wore when their young heroes sailed away; Soft smiles the dewy fire in loving eyes! And, when to the full breast, O mothers! your re-given ones you take, And in your long embraces they are blest, Give them one hug at heart for England's sakeâ The Mother of us all! Dear to us, near to us, though so far apart; For whose defence we are sworn to stand or fall In the same battle as Brothers, one at heart: All one to bear the brunt; All one we move together in the march, Shoulder to shoulder; to the Foe all front, The wide world round; all heaven one Triumph-Arch! One in the war of Mind, For clearing earth of all dark Jungle-Powers; One for the Federation of Mankind, Who will speak one language, and that language ours. Sydney, 1885. LAST LYRICS. WAITING FOR THE VERDICT. Through Centuries did Erin grope In dust and ashes for lost hope; Or darkly sought around her cave An outlet from a living grave, She sadly strove to tell her wrongsâ Grown venerably grayâin songs; Or looked, with breast too full for speech, Mute at the Heaven beyond her reach. And now she turns to you, My Land! Heart-open at your proffered hand: Into a new life's quickening womb, One smile of light transforms her Tomb. Through Centuries of doubts and fears She drained her Cup of bitter tears; To the last dregs she drank it up, And now behold an empty Cup! With the forlornest face on earth, And praying hands, she holds it forthâ Say, will you fill it with glad wine, Or make it brim again with brine? Or shall we quaff together instead The cup that blushes a guilty red? You have your choice; no time to halt; Our hearts are with her in revolt! THE GREAT NEW CAUSE. Peace, shall it be? or War to the knife? Sentence of Death or freedom for life? Is the bloody Vendetta to die away As Dawn dis-purples in clear white day? Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! Shall the Mother again be terribly torn, That another Abortion may be born? Or a nobler Nation struggle forth, With the labour-pangs of a larger birth? Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! Shall Ireland's Music be always the Caoine? Our Rose ever seen gory-red on her Green? Shall the smoke of her torment ascend on high Till Death in that land is our only Ally? Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! Shall the pick of a people be driven to roam The world for ever in search of a Home, Because we are turning their life-giving Land Into a Desert of rootless sand? Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! âGod save Erin,â is their cry, As the Exiles die under every sky! In praying or cursing, the one cry still; âGod save Erin.â As surely He will! Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! John Bull is awaking at last; and John, They warn us, is pulling his big boots on! But we read 'twixt his smile and the gathering frown It isn't for treading the Irish down! Stand for the Liberation Laws, The Grand Old Man and the Great New Cause! THE âGRAND OLD MAN.â Shall the Tie that is binding us be but a Tetherâ Nought but a Fetter between our Lands? All the world waits for your answer, whether We govern by Handcuffs or clasping of Hands. Be not misled by Promoters of panic; Be not beguiled by the Brummagem plan; Show that your mettle's not falsely Britannic, But true in its ring for the Grand Old Man. We would have England do rightly by others, Not wrongly for us, as so long hath been done: We would have Irishmen friendly as brothers, Bound, if at heart we are wedded and one. Close up the Gulf the Fire-Furies have riven! While Curtius is with us and leading our van, You have but to will and it must be. By heaven, It shall be! Come, follow the Grand Old Man. Well may they dub him the âOne-man Power,â Standing alone where there's room but for one, In his pride of place, like a Mountain Tower That catches the rays of a rising Sun! We, in the Valley of Final Decision, Gather around him as close as we can, To see what he sees on his Summit of Vision, The Triumph that beckons the Grand Old Man. Behind us the Darkness of Tyrannies olden Still threatens with thunders of impotent wrath; Before us a âSunburstâ the Present makes golden; A smile of the Future shows clearly our path. Theirs was the Night with its blindness, its sorrow, Its riftage of Strife where the red rivers ran; Ours is the Dawn: and a brighter To-morrow Shall crown with its glory the Grand Old Man. A LEADER! Up Alma's hill the Ensign went, A Boy! but terribly intent! His should be foremost of the Flags, Though He and It were shot to rags! He looked round only once, to find The men for a moment lagged behind. âBring back the Colours to them!â cried The Colonel. But the Lad replied, âNo! lead you up the men who lag, Hurry them forward to the Flag!â So far ahead Our Ensign leads, The laggards tell us he Secedes! He could not stay the fight, to say Our victory lies the Onward way! âBring back the Colours to the rear, For those who fight the battle there!â No! no! far forward He stands fast, First with the Colours, to the last! No cry of Laggards will he heed: A Leader's duty is to lead. LOOKING BEFORE AND AFTER. You say in front our Pitfalls wait Agape to engulf us soon or late; And open-eyed we face our fate! We say your Pitfalls lurk behind, And, driven backward, you will find In falling you must go it blind! FALSE MARRIAGE OR TRUE UNION? You offer what they do not want, And what they sue for will not grant. We give them Power, that theirs may be A real responsibility! You talk of Union, while each word Is felt as Bludgeon-Sounds are heard, When brute Wife-beaters once more try To weld with blows Their Wedding-tie! You prophesy the coming wave Will be our dear old England's grave, Because you lack the strength of limb And length of breath enough to swim! You fear for self!âno fear for her!â And Fear's a craven counsellor. You may go under our high-tide, The Deluge that drowns you she can ride! Lie as you will to circumvent, Or trail the herring across the scent, No more shall we defend your spoil Taken from immemorial toil. We will not play Cat's-paw again To Filchers monkeying round as men. The people set their fellows free; One is the World's Democracy. Henceforth we must have Government, Not by Coercion, but Consent. Right shall be done at last to all, Even though the Ancient Heavens fall On which our Childhood hung its trust. New Heavens will rise from their old dust, To loftier heights, with larger span, And ampler space for grown-up man. The Torch of Freedom God hath lit, Burns upward for the Infinite, And through all hindrances it will, And must, and shall burn Upward still. And all who try to hold the Torch Inverted, will to ashes scorch; And all who stay the upward aim Shall shrivel like the Fly in flame. JOHN BRIGHT. Thou hast done good work in thy day, John! Thou wert foremost in many a fray, John! Thou shouldst have been first to the end. But to halt when they sound the advance, John! Thou art losing a glorious chance, John! Of dying the People's Friend! Once thou wert terribly feared, John! The enemy spat on the beard, John! Of the Rebel so radical then! And to see how they slaver thee now, John! Their Model for Statesmen art Thou, John! Their man who art Monarch of men! 'Tis Here and 'tis Now that we test, John! All sympathies for the Oppressed, John! Not in far-off lands or the Past. 'Tis Here and 'tis Now We can give, John! New leave for a people to live, John! In a Union with Us that shall last. But faint hearts have gone far enough, John! The road is so long and so rough, John! That many fall out by the way: And 'tis darkâfor the Stars are withdrawn, John! Before we can see the fresh Dawn, John! That brings in the perfectest day. The fastest of Friends will now fail us, John! Worse than our Foes they assail us, John! Like fighters of Parthian mould. And some have got tired with age, John! Yet the Future must turn its new page, John! And the People can never grow old. Thy hand for a parting shake, John! Heartily cordial, we take, John! If the old ties thou wilt tear. But Our battle must still go on, John! Victories have to be won, John! Though Thou wilt not be with us there. THE PRIMROSE DAME. Your Primrose Dame is a likely Lass, To wile and wheedle the Working Class Of their Votesâher end and aim! A vision of beauty, in by-way or street, Is the glance of her face, or a glimpse of her feet,â When a-foot is the Primrose Dame. The men used to suffer the brunt of the strife,â Kissed the children, Courted the Wife, And cured the halt and the lame; But they who once lorded it over the poll Now send out the women to cadge and cajole,â Pray you pity the Primrose Dame! We're all of One flesh, at Election time, Whether white-powdered or black with grime,â Skim-milk, or CrÃªme de la crÃªme; Open-armed at your door she knocks, Wants to pry into the Ballot-box, Does the promising Primrose Dame. Soliciting Votes, she is not shy, Will let you light your pipe at her eye,â Kindle your fire with her flame; But beware of the Snare when you see the smile, Under the Primrose she can beguile. 'Tis the Beaconsfield Primrose Dame! âRefreshments at five, in the Primrose Bower! You will come? You will wear it? My favourite flower? His flower who gave it his fame!â And the touch is of velvet, the look is of love: But beware of the claw that is sheathed in the glove Of the Beaconsfield Primrose Dame. She will scatter her perfume around you in showers, Wrung from the lives of our Human Flowers, Without thought of shame or blame; And the Roses of Health, that were ruthlessly torn From the cheeks of your Children are wantonly worn In the Robe of the Primrose Dame. She simply asks to be mounted astride The British Lionâthinks she can guide, And the rampant animal tame, If he will only give her his trust; If he will only kneel down in the dust To carry the Primrose Dame. Her charm for leading the beast by the nose Is the brazenest image, a gilt primrose,â What a meal for an empty wame! You Flower of Shams, with your counterfeit, If the Brute should be tempted either to eat,â Let us pray for the Primrose Dame! BATTLE OF THE RANK AND FILE. 'Tis a proud Story! how through mist and mire, All facing straight for death, our fellows ran To warm them that cold day at the Russian fire, And fight the Soldiers' battle of Inkerman! No time for orders; none for falling in; They only knew their duty was to stem The tide of onset; and their work, to win The desperate battleâthat was won by them. It is Our Inkerman we fight to-day! False friends behind us, worse than foes in front; One half our Officers have run away; The Rank and File must bravelier bear the brunt! No matter where our place is on the field; Each one must be all there, whether to stem The tide, or stop the gap, and never yield. The People's battle must be won by them! THE LEAGUE OF LABOUR. Long on the Mountain Summit We fed the Watch-fire's flame; We hailed and beckoned from it The help that never came! We heard the distance humming, With sounds o' the Battle-Drum: We dreamed the Prince was coming, And lo! the Prince has come,â 'Tis our Enfranchised Neighbour Who joins the League of Labour To end our martyrdom. We brooded o'er the Story That bade us Backward turn To seek a By-gone Glory, And made our spirits burn: We tried to sing our Sorrow, And wail our Woes, away; We lived but for the Morrow To free us from To-day. Now Neighbour joins with Neighbour, One in the League of Labour To scare the Birds of Prey. 'Twas not in maiming Cattle, Nor desolating Homes, That we could win our battle By which deliverance comes. No Tocsin from the Steeple, No Beacons through the land, We need, when Honest people Each other understand, And Neighbour joins with Neighbour, One in the League of Labour As Brothers hand in hand. âThey hardly read a letter!â So simple are our ends, We know not any better Than that we may be friends. At the new Name of âBrotherâ Old feuds grow fugitive! We have not wronged each other, We therefore can forgive. So Neighbour stands by Neighbour, One in the League of Labour; One in the right to live. LABOURERS' ELECTION SONG. (Tune: âJohn Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave.â) Ours are the Voices that for ages were unheard, Ours are the Voices of a Future long deferred. Cry all Together: we shall speak the final word, Let the Cause go marching on. Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Let the Cause go marching on. Ours are the Votes that give us weapons we can wield, Ours are the Votes that make our proud opponents yield. Vote all Together, and our Charge shall clear the field, And the Cause go marching on. Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Let the Cause go marching on. Ours are the Millions, though it may not be in gold, Ours are the Millions who will right the wrongs of old. Move all Together as the Ocean-waves are rolled, When the Storm goes marching on. Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Glory! glory! hallelujah! Let the Cause go marching on. THE LAST OF EMERGENCY MEN. One word. Then for battle we hold in our breath, To fight you; by God! we shall fight to the death: Through Earth, Heaven, or Hell, and the range of Endeavour, If need be; by God! we will fight you for ever! You have drawn the first blood in our opening battle; We score you that honour! You've tested our mettle! And never was Battle yet fought worth the winning But those who won last seemed to lose in beginning. Coercion has failed you again and again, And you are the Last of Emergency Men! Our Cause is propelled by the spurn of your feet! You kindle our furnace to sevenfold heat, Till, as Slag from the fire, you will only be found! E'en in turning a Treadmill our triumph comes round: Coercion has failed you again and again, And you are the last of Emergency Men! One word. Then for battle we hold in our breath, To fight you; by God! we shall fight to the death: Through Earth, Heaven, or Hell, and the range of endeavour, If need be; by God! we will fight you for ever! HOLD TOGETHER, BOYS. Ay, hold Together for God's sake now, The Devil hath his hour, And rages fiercely, knowing how Precarious is his power! One last grim effort, grasping hands The gaping gulf to bridge, Before the Channel 'twixt two lands Runs red from ridge to ridge. With your own life-drops warm and wet They dangle the red rag On Baton and on Bayonet, As their Bull-Baiting Flag; And palest faces well may flush, Hearts beat the battle-drum: But keep your Ranks and make no rush, Till the Relief shall come. We will be with you soon in front, Or fighting side by side: To-day 'tis yours to bear the brunt So often borne with pride! We feel no coward fear for you, Though sore it be to bear; We fight your battle here for you Who fight our battle there! For Future life keep calm as death, For strength gulp down your ire; Waste not a word to lose a breath, While passing through the fire! Worthily follow your great Dead Who played the deathless part; Policeâwho have power to break the headâ Can't break a Nation's heart. TO-MORROW! Though not yet freedâfrom England's Soul There's one more Fetter broken! The spirit that will reach the goal, And win at last, has spoken. We Swearâand all the world has heardâ To end this Shame and Sorrow; And as God lives To-Day, that Word Shall be our Deed To-Morrow. Our opening eyes, at length, though late, Can see the Ancient Blindness; And we, who crushed each other in hate, Would try the Clasp of Kindness,â Would reach the Irish heart with grip Frank, honest, trustful, thorough; And show how fearless Statesmanship Can make us Friends To-Morrow. You had to trust them many a time, As on them Napier reckoned To win Meeanee's fight sublime, With his glorious âTwenty-Secondââ âMagnificent Tipperary!â He Could lean on them, and borrow His rest that night! for Victory Would march with them To-Morrow. To think of all our Irish Dead Should thrill you English living! For us they fought, for us they bled, To us the triumph giving! Foremost on many a bloody day They charged with their wild âHurroo!â Through England's Foes they clove a way For Ireland free To-Morrow. For us they conquered as they died, And with their last endeavour, Dying for England, still they cried, âOld Ireland for ever!â Their dust has given us deeper root In many a field and furrow; We think 'tis time they shared the fruit, And they shall share To-Morrow! LIGHT AT LAST. The sleep of the Dreamer is dying; The Dream is about to be born: 'Tis the Vision of England untying The crown of poor Ireland's Thorn! The Night with its phantoms is flying, And we shall see clearer at morn: We feel the first airs that come sighing, New life to awaken; and warn Of a Light in which tears shall be drying, And hell-fire no longer can burn: Immortals with mortals are vieing To lift up the fall'n and forlorn: Our old Earth shall cease from her crying, Nor vainly to Heaven will yearn: We stand 'twixt the dawning and dying, That mingle their Verge and their Bourne: The Past with its Shroud-Shadows trying To hide its face, tortured and torn; The Future before us Enskying A glimpse of Millennial Morn: 'Tis the Vision of England untying The crown of poor Ireland's Thorn; And the sleep of the Dreamer is dying: The Dream is about to be born. THE END.</field>
