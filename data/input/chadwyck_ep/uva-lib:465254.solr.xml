I While Anarchy uprears her form Gigantic in the martial storm, And strides across the groaning plain Where War hath heap'd his hills of slain, Or (as she speeds the work of Death Amid the city's lurid air) Wafts wide, O Pestilence, thy breath, Exulting in the venom'd gasp; And, Famine! sinews thy fell grasp; To the pale nations while with ghastly glare She fires the sanguine eye, and lifts the bristling hair; II Still happy Albion, tho' her shore Shake to the naval battle's roar, Opes the green bosom of her isle To meet, O Harmony, thy smile! And tho' to military pride Unfurl'd, her standard shade our coasts, In vales where sparkling currents glide Benignant Plenty pours her horn, And Health as vivid as the morn Amid the inspiring breeze his ardor boasts, And Freedom roves secure, nor dreads assailing hosts! III No more the fiend-arrested foe Heeds the gay-clustering vineyard's glow: No more the village-dales of France Give echoes to her airy dance. No more her nobles bid the dome Resound with music's festal note. Alas! in desolated gloom Portentous Ruin loads the ground; Tho' erst the embattled palace frown'd Shadowing with massy towers its ancient moat: Alas! o'er sedgy lawns the unchannel'd waters float! IV Yet Albion, at the cottage-green, Beholds, as erst, the quiet scene; Still views the hereditary farm With each domestic blessing warm; Surveys the extensive granary fill'd As in old time with Autumn's store, While the same grounds his grandsire till'd The yeoman's busy care repay: Still sees the scutcheon'd hall display The heraldric honors, as when chiefs of yore Listen'd, in spousal state, to the rich minstrel lore. V Say, while each work that bore the rust Of age, lies crumbled into dust, In other climes, where, whelming all, The war-fiend seems to crush the ball; Say, by what magic power we hold Tenures our sires were proud to own Still unpolluted as of old? Is it, that time hath render'd dear The boon we cherish and revere? We look not to this sacred source alone, But to the filial love, which guards a George's throne! VI When we behold the regal rays, That brighten to a sun-like blaze, From the domestic circle spring And in the parent mark the king; Shall not affection, fond to trace The virtues of our sire, avail, To fix on yet untrembling base, The pillars of the sovereign dome? And if it's wonted beams illume The palace, shall the castle-splendor fail, Or shall the hamlet sink, and cease to cheer the dale? VII The cares that watch thy weal, O Prince, A nation's loyal love evinceâ That love which, linkt to harmony, Heaven hath, perhaps, reserv'd for thee! Yes! if the rose-inwoven bower To spotless Hymen rear'd, refine Thy soul in the connubial hour; And if thy pure parental fire Beyond the private walk aspire, And in thy zeal for Britain's glory shine; Then shall those ardent vows that bless thy sire, be thine. VIII Yes! if the sycophantic crew Tremble thy footsteps to pursue, Diffusing far the taint of vice Where Riot glories to entice The unweeting bosom to its snare; If thou, with manly soul, dismiss The extravagance, whose gaudy glare The fool divine effulgence deems; If, waken'd from the feverish dreams Of love, thou spurn the sensual bliss, Behold! thy garment's hem a grateful kingdom kiss. IX Bright in the charms of vernal youth A Brunswick claims thy manly truth. Not in the hues of Folly gay, Or vagrant Dissipation's ray, She comes from no degenerate court, Where native dignity commands Each sister-grace, their lov'd resort; Where no imperious fashion haunts Its cheerless victims as it flaunts The ephemeral vesture, but in social bands The blue-ey'd pleasures meet, and join their willing hands. X As yon bark skims the distant seas, Impatience hovers on the breeze. The murmurs of the wave subside, And soft airs curl the ripling tide! The dim sail whitens on the sight! Around the gilded vessel dance Colours, that stream a rainbow light! I see the veiling umbrage shade The blushes of the bridal maid! And the Loves fluttering as the sails advance, O'er her ambrosial form their purple pinions glance. XI The choral brilliance bursting round, Her modest eye that meets the ground, Seems sparkling to the crimson cheek, Where her soft flaxen tresses break! Sudden the unfolding portals blaze, While millions hail their prince's choice. Amid the universal gaze, Amid the popular acclaim That seems to stamp each hallow'd name With images of fadeless worth, ârejoice!â Yet âtremble!ââand attend a heaven-directed voice. XII The voice I hearâor seem to hear; Breath'd in soft tones it meets my earâ âGo, happy pairâ (a spirit cries, The Power that rules o'er British skies) âGo, where the nuptial planet blends âIts lustre with the Georgian star, âAnd to the couch of Hymen lends âThe chasten'd influence, which alone âLoosens, uncheckt, the virgin zone; âWhile, gliding on the bosom of the air, âLove wreathes with evening-flowers his dew-besprinkled car. XIII âGo, copy those perfections bright âWhich give to crowns untarnisht lightâ âBe this your first, your proudest aim; âFor such is virtue, such is fame! âSo shall the British race transcribe âYour fair examples not in vain; âWhile, as they scorn the venal tribe, âAnd crush the democratic band âWho hurl around the burning brand, âThey bid the throne its pristine pomp retain, âAnd Albion, in her Howes, still sway the extensive main.â. HIGHLAND ODE. I Ere Arven vanish'd from my eyes, And left my widow'd soul to sighs, How sweet, where summer breezes blow, To trace the heath-flower's gradual glow, Lift the grey linnet's song, or mark Half-hid in clouds, the mounting lark, Or wander, where the lucid rill Tinkles beside the pine-crown'd hill, Or, deep within the forest, start Mid intertwisted boughs the hart, Or hail, with my old hunting-horn, The echoes of the merry morne, Then seek the hall, where plenty dwells, And share, at eve, the feast of shells! II But Arven's feet, with gentle print, Gave to the tender flower its tint: Soon as its matin song was heard My Arven plum'd the soaring bird: She bade the prattling streamlet flow, Or with pleas'd eye pursu'd the doe: Her image only render'd dear The wildwood chace, the festal cheer! Alas! when mild as morning breaks, I view'd the blushes on her cheeks, When heav'd her snowy breast, more fair In constrast with her raven hair, She seem'd all nature to absorb In the pure brightness of her orb. III And once, when o'er the thistly waste Murmur'd the melancholy blast, When from the dark-red thunder broke The flame that rent the towering oak, When spectres clad in sable shrouds, Gleam'd from the chambers of the clouds; When slow, along the midnight heath, Mov'd the prophetic pomp of death; When helmets, hung in darksome rows, Shook to the moon, their steely brows; 'Twas then I deem'd some danger near, And own'd my bosom chill'd with fear; For, as I saw her pallid hue, Her shuddering frame, I trembled too! IV Yet now the lightning's shaft may fly; And ghosts may beckon from on high. Tho' others quiver as the leaf; I fear notâI am full of grief! The pale procession big with fate, I heed not the funereal state! Other may shrink in lonely halls, From casques that sigh along the walls; Unterrified I sit alone, And catch the lifted vizor's groan! 'Tis only at my Arven's tomb I see condens'd the gather'd gloom: Yet, as I drink the charnel air, I weep, but cannot tremble there! ÃGYPTIAN ODE Where bosom-thrilling transports glow, We oft observe the intruder Woe!â See tufted Faioum breathe delight From rose-trees kindling on the sight, From orange-blooms, or tamarind-bowers, Or the pomegranate's scarlet flowers, And loftier palms, that wave between Their foliage of a deeper green, Relieving the bright azure skies While thro' the fragrance as it blows A stream of liquid amber flows, While nestles many a gurgling dove Within the bosom of the grove, And from the shade on sable wings With crimson strip'dâthe flamen springs, And the plum'd ostrich on the sands, Or pelican majestic stands. To cool the sun's meridian beams, There fruits refreshing kiss the streams, Or blushing to eve's purple ray Amid the breezy verdure playâ As its leaves shade each silver sluice The pulpy water-melon's juice, To eager thirst delicious balm; And sugary dates that crown the palm. Yet from the rocks that skirt the wood, Fell tigers bound, to thirst on blood; Yet the wide-water'd landscapes smile, Where lurks the treacherous crocodile; And, ere the melting fruit we grasp, Death-doom'd, we feel the envenom'd asp. Then hail my Albion's hoary coast, Where, tho' no scenes Elysium boast, We court not temperate joys in vain, Not thrill'd by bliss, nor stung by pain. ARABIAN ODE. I Where the wild ostrich, 'mid the sands Resigns her eggs to fostering day; And camels, to the sabred bands Obedient, track their fiery way; An Arab wont to breathe his sighs, To all the blasting winds that rise. II Now to the east where op'd his tent Fast by a gushing brook's cool side, His garment in despair he rent, And to the unpitying desart cried: Then, his eyes fasten'd to the ground, His legs he crost, in grief profound. III âAh, why, proud fair-one, slight my love? Why were thy black eyes, large and soft As any gazelle's of the grove? Why have I call'd thine eyebrows, oft, Two ebon bows, so finely archt, If thus I waste away, love-parcht? IV Why thus thine eyelashes unfold Darken'd with such a sable hue? Why tincture thy smooth nails with gold, Or stain thy parting lips with blue, If thou condemn me still to pine, Nor with thy sighings answer mine? V How my heart flutters, as I cast On thy two heaving breasts, a glanceâ Thy two pomegranatesâor thy waist More straight and supple than a lance; Or mark, amid the starry night, Thy steps, as the young filley's light. VI And ah! thy words as honey sweetâ Alas! they are not sweet to me! Oft as I chance thy form to meet, Some token of my woes I see!â Thus mourn'd he Love's consuming powerâ His frame its shadow yields no more. SONNET TO MR. WHITAKER. What tho' the splendor of thy genius draws From Europe's letter'd sons the acclaim of praise; Yet, with new energy to nerve my lays, I gaze not on those gifts that gain applause. NoâI survey thee steady in the cause Of thy religion, in these faithless days! I venerate that strong unshaken mind Which, for the Saviour-God, the atoning cross, A rich-alluring patronage resign'd; Counting the treasures of the world as dross! I love that soul which no mean cares engross, Which melts in sympathy for human kind! O may I never live to mourn thy loss, But by thy soothing aid thro' life's dark valley wind! Feeling as I do, that Mr. Whitaker deserves the highest praise for his constancy in support of (what appears to me to be) genuine Christianity, I am at the same time duly sensible of the illiberality of those who, in their zeal for religion, allow not others to think as well as themselves. It was under this impression that I wrote the following lines in memory of Horne and Kippis. Tho', pious Horne! around thy tomb A Bagot, with new fervor fir'd, A Nares, with patriotic love inspir'd, A Jones, with all thy genius fraught, A More, by thy familiar precepts taught, In sighs relieve the funeral gloom; Tho', o'er his honour'd Kippis, with a Rees, A Parr the fond effusion pours, And tho' an Aikin joins a Towers, Where, floating on the breeze, Maria's woodnotes sweet Her guardian's hovering shade divinely greet; Yet hath my Muse exulted to survey Those spirits such a generous grief display As soars above the little cares of earthâ The vain distinctions,âwhile by death withdrawn We mark no more the prelate's lawn! Yetâyet I see them mourn departed worth, With such a heart-smile as our being cheers, And meet in one kind groupe, and mix congenial tears! It may be needless to add, that in Bishop Bagot the polished manners of modern times, are blended with the piety, simplicity and zeal of the apostolic ageâthat to Mr. Nares (late student of Christ Church) whose Sermons are read with all the attention due to excellence, the term âPatriotic,â may be justly applied, in its original acceptationâthat Mr. Jones, the worthy friend and biographer of Bishop Horne, resembles in amiableness of character that good prelateâthat Miss Hannah More, who was formerly honoured with the friendship of Garrick, and latterly with that of Horne, has experienced a happy change, while the enthusiasm of the Poet is lost in the zeal of the Christianâand that the names of Rees, of Parr, of Aikin and of Towers, will be announced, to the triumph of human nature, as long as genius, taste and science shall be respected among menâas long as charity shall remain, a distinguishing feature of Christianity. ODE TO A RED-BREAST. Sweet bird, whose melting lay Deceives the wintry day, Come to my cot, while now the orient beams! O'er hills of purpled snow See faint the radiance glow, And fleeting shadows brush yon iced streams. Approach, devoid of fear; No cruel heart is here: On thee shall Pity lift her glistening eyeâ Amid yon leafless grove, Dejected dost thou rove, And shiver with a solitary sigh? O fly the dreary shade, Which fatal snares invadeâ There, there the truant school-boy bends his way: No sympathy he feels, But death around him deals, Wild as the hawk that pounces on his prey. Yesâtho' the morning rise Oe'r azure-vaulted skies, With a pale lustre shines the frosty sun: For thee my cheerful fire Shall genial warmth inspire; Here lurks no springe, nor roars the murderous gun. My hospitable board Shall grateful food affordâ Lo, cold and hunger at a distance dwellâ Then listen to my strain, Come, peck this scatter'd grain, These dainty crumbs, nor dread my sylvan cell. What time, to greet the year, As vernal blooms appear, Thy brother warblers wake their choral laysâ Go, pour thy little throat, Go, mix thy tender note With each sweet song of tributary praise! LINES ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY. Feb. 13, 1780. Ye Fair, who flirt in life's fantastic round, Come, where a scene the face of anguish wears; And, as the death-bell flings a sullen sound, Be yours the precious luxury of tears. Come, gentle spirits, tho' your bosoms heave With wild emotions, bid not sorrow sleep; To you, her lovely children, Nature gave The heart to pity, and the eye to weep. What tho' ye taste the dear deluding joy, As each gay vision gilds the midnight hour; O let not Fancy labour to destroy In many an idle dream, Reflection's power. Full soon to weave the mazes of the dance, To join with vacant mirth the festal roar, To flutter thro' the regions of romance In many an idle dream, shall charm no more. Yes! she is gone. Lo, there she rests her head, Pale as the spectre that appals the glooms: Behold the shrivell'd features of the dead! 'Tis but to fade the rose of beauty blooms. Ye Virgins, she was fairer far than youâ Fair as the Poet's pencil can pourtray: And from those eyes, now quencht by Death's cold dew, Pure native sense effus'd the vivid ray. But a superior charm to Truth she ow'd, Unpractis'd in the mimicries of Art: Hers was the sweet simplicity that glow'd With all the quick expression of the heart. Oft shall the scenes that mark'd her life arise, And from her Henry steal a trembling tear, As Memory paints her faded form in sighsâ Delicious sighs to Love and Fancy dear! Yet, why Amanda, shall Affection grieve For thee, tho' hurried from our view by Fate, Thee, whom a happier mansion shall receive, And whom no perishable joys await. Go then, dear shade, where kindred spirits rest, Go from a vale of darkness to the skiesâ Go then, where He in whom thy soul is blest, Shall wipe all tears for ever from thine eyes! THE THUNDER. June 8, 1795. Far in the dim south-east, a thin white cloud Drawn out and spreading like a curtain, veils The untinted morn. And o'er that duskier creek Fring'd with dun coppice, lo the Thunder seems To brood incumbent. See he slowly lifts Above the horizon his red bristling locks, While many a livid speck of sulphur swells Around him, as he rears his giant form. Lo, at the extremity of heaven, he heaps Cloud upon cloud, like rock high pil'd on rock, Solid and vast. And now, while overhead The pale blue sky is streakt with a dense line Of white, he pauses, as if unresolv'd Or to roll on his wrath, or to suspend Awhile, the terrors of his threatening arm. Yet, as he breathes a suffocating blast Thro' the still air, we gasp, as where the eye Of Syroc, fires the sands of Afric's waste. 'Tis noon. And hark! the squally wind comes on, Rushing amain: I hear it like the sound Of hostile spirit shouting; as enrag'd He rises, to confront his surly foe, Then sinks in leaden slumber. From the north Again the rude gale whistles, till at length He slopes his dread artillery west away, Yet muttering vengeance. Yes! while now the sun, That pale and flickering had by fits appear'd, Sinks like a ball of blood, methinks, he growls Waiting his prey. I see, I see him grasp The lurid orb, and rend it from heaven's vault, And quench it, as in everlasting gloom. TO A CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR, MUCH GIVEN TO PUNNING. Hail high Professor! to thee gracious Heaven An envied empire over Puns hath given! Tho' oft divine astronomy may call Thy glasses to descry the radiant ball, Thy active genius by no rules confin'd Still leaves the planets to the plodding mind; Eager alone the race of Wit to run, And panting for the glorious goalâa Pun! Let souls mechanic wind thro' study's maze, And for dark science barter dearer ease: A brighter course thy fervent spirit runsâ Sense, wisdom, learning, what are yeâto Puns? What tho' the little wits, to fame unknown, Raise the loud laugh, or pour the deepening groan: What tho' around the sapient sneer be spread, And critic darts assail thy reverend head; Yet have I seen thee taste the thrilling bliss Of self-applause, amid the general hiss, And each mean wretch with scornful eye regard, Assur'd, that merit is its own reward! So, when appears the solemn bird of night, At noontide labouring thro' a blaze of light; Sudden, around the warblers of the day, Insulting, on their airy pinions play; Now here, now there, in wanton circles fly: And a shrill clamour echoes thro' the sky. But he, unruffled, plies his wings along, Nor heeds the malice of the chattering throng; O'erlooks, or eyes askance each giddy fowl, Plum'd in the conscious merit of an owl! These lines were afterwards transferred to a Country Mercer, equally as fond of a Pun as our Cambridge-Professor. Hail, happy Tom, to whom indulgent Heaven To rule o'er Puns and Tape, alike, hath given! What tho' condemn'd to guide the flippant yard, Thy Brussels lace unwinding from its card, Thy genius sports, by measure unconfin'd, And greatly scorns the poor mechanic mind! Still, as thy yard proceeds, I see thee spurn The dust beneath, on tiptoe at each turn; While girls confess in many a laughing fit, What's lack'd in measure, is made upâin wit! THE PILCHARD-SEINE: A FRAGMENT. WRITTEN ON A TOUR THROUGH CORNWALL, IN 1794. See, to the surface of the sea they rise, Colouring the tremulous wave with ruddy beams. Now from the boats deep-laden, at the beach, Are pour'd forth myriads of the glittering race In many a mountain-heapâWhat numerous lives Struggle and saint, then melt into thin air! Pure spirits that, commingled with the skies, No mortal sense assail. Alas! not so Their grosser bodies; that, ere long, attack The nerve olfactory with noisome stench, Such as the cunning Reynard ne'er effus'd The bloody pack to annoy. Anon, a crowd Of boisterous females, ruder far than those Yclept of Billingsgate, snuff up with glee The savoury blessing. Lo, the cellar-gates Flung open to receive the prize, they part From the fat-bellied the more puny fry: Kindly manure, to enrich the slaty land. Others, meantime, in curious order, place The silver rows; scattering with hands profuse, Those nitrous particles by which the world Exists, unputrified. Rank above rank, The scales arise, in regular array, Till the pile, deep and well-compacted, mount E'en to the cellar-roofs, a mighty bulk. There for awhile it rests. But say, O Muse, Who lov'st to lead thy votary o'er the hills Of Manathon, whence many a winding creek Fring'd with luxuriant coppice, whence the sea's Green bosom he surveysâor bid'st, perchance, The nearer landscape his fond eye attract To the soft verdure of its elmy dales, To its neat hamlets percht on crags aloft, To its trim orchards, to its clustering hops, Or to its ragged oaks, whose pale crests moan The western galeâSay, Muse, who court'st the airs Breath'd from the tender myrtle bower, that marks Each little garden fast by tinkling rill; Say, how canst thou depict, on palet meet, The pilchard process, from which Hottentots Might shrink disdainful?âTo pull down the pile That erst so regular arose, to wash The scaled salt from every tasteful fish, To fill the unheaded barrels with the fry, To range the saturated casks, to set On each its weight enormous, and to urge The groaning press till floods of oil descend, And copious, down the pebbled channel roll; Such is the task of beings that scarce claim The name of human, toiling amidst filth Pestiferous, and by ardent draughts sustain'd. Sicken'd by these effluvia, I return To where Condurra shall with other steams Ere long salute my nostrilsâsteams, exhal'd From fruits ambrosialâracy apples crisp, Such as exhilarate my frame, and give My glowing Muse to aim at loftier themes. LINES WRITTEN AT W? LODGE IN DEVON, IN 1794. Where, in the liveliest green array'd, The tall trees sport with light and shade, Amid the groves of W? Lodge Trudges secure the jocund Hodge; And, as he chaunts his rude love tale, No fears the villager assail. E'en tho' a slumbering hare he wakes, His frame with no wild tremor shakes. But, if his erring footsteps range Along the gloomy walks of G? Where art, oppressing nature, bids Her yews shoot up in pyramids, Or cuts them into cones and squaresâ Heaven guard him from the holy hares. Not that the squire of G? has, like the Author of the Task, any lively sense of feeling for the poor animal. It is for the sake of the sport that he interdicts the molestation of his hares. Other sportsmen have congenial sentiments with himself. And with these characters the conquest of a little inoffensive creature is the ultimate pleasure of the chace. This, some philosophers argue, is inconsistent with human nature. The invigorating exercise that accompanies the chace, is certainly (say they) the actuating principle. And the necessity (they add) of supplying the table with food, is another leading motive. But philosophers, who derive their knowledge from books, argue from what human nature should be, rather than from what it is. Whoever has observed the perseverance with which our modern gentry pursue the flying hare, in spite of every disadvantage of country, and the triumphant exultations which are heard on every side when the wearied helpless animal falls a prey to his pursuers, will easily perceive that neither health nor appetite are motives for the chace; but that the actuating principle which impels our countrymen to the field is merely the cowardly satisfaction of seeing a poor little brown animal wearied and pleading for mercy, torn in pieces by the ravenous jaws of twenty couple of red and white animals which pursue him. And that man is received with every mark of triumph, who is nearest the defenceless creature when he falls, and feasts his eyes with the tortures of the mangled victim! To meet bold Puss in yonder path, Were worse than to commit a rape! For well the farmer mutter'dââFath, â'Tis maister's girl that takes the shape âOf Puss so squat above the ditch! âOff, off, 'tis maister's little witch!â THE VILLAGE. SUNDAY-EVE. May, 1794. Where, on the burnisht panes, beneath thy tower, O Manathon! mild evening flings its rays, Behold a thoughtless progeny, let loose From catechetic lecture, quick pursue The rolling circle, tho' they look behind With tremulous apprehension as they run, Or, at each murmur of the poplar-breeze, Shrink back in silence from the imagin'd form Of their stern parson, who might strait unlock That engine which, in durance vile, detains The culprit, closing on the imprison'd legs. But see a graver tribe pace down the hill; And, where thick hollies shade the lane, survey That sallow-visag'd girl upon the arm Of her white-trowser'd paramour reposeâ Alas! the pale chlorosis hath consum'd Her cherry cheek. Meantime, amid the groupe Of cottages, yon whiten'd walls allure The eye of passenger, but chief the glare Of gaudy anchor, too attractive sign! There shall the loitering rustic hail the dusk, Heedless of home. And say, within those huts Clustering around, is there one little nook That wears a Sabbath aspectâsuch as, erst, The simple fathers of the hamlet lov'd? Perchance, some antique crone, green-spectacled, May bend her dim eye o'er the unclasped book, Then stir the brightening embers, and then conn The holy text, till twilight. But, perchance, One only such yet lingers; to recount With boding sighs her tale of other days, Frail relic of primeval piety! So, on a Sabbath, sets the village-eve! EXTEMPORE LINES TO MISS W? ON HER VINDICATION OF GRAY'S ODE TO SPRING, AGAINST THE CHARGE OF OBSCURITY. To vindicate a Poet's strain When female accents flow; With sullen wrinkles frowns in vain The hypercritic brow. 'Tis thus thy bright ideas check The asperser's weak essay; While, gentle pleader, not a speck Obscures the page of Gray. Yet spare the task: to grace thy bard The tuneful ode rehearseâ Thy liquid voice alone, sweet W?! Gives clearness to his verse! LINES TO MISS T? WITH A PRESENT OF A VOLUME OF POEMS. Feb. 1, 1792. O Mary, take, nor coldly slight This tribute of esteem: Think not sincerity, like mine, An airy-woven dream. Tho' William share the enamour'd hour, Your heart shall not refuse, One little moment, to regard A true devoted Muse. So shall that faithful Muse, ere long, The spousal numbers chauntâ And O! be every blessing yours, That Love, that Heaven can grant! My faultering tongue essays to add Still something to the store: But vainly language would express, Or Friendship wish you more. THE WISHFUL SWAIN, OF DEVON. While Autumn choak'd with leaves the rill, Colin, within a shady combe, Had shap'd his mow, beneath the hill, And kept the merry harvest-home; And of its The sweet apple, called the bitter-sweet, is more common in the orchards of Devon, than acid fruit, or the rough-sour. bitter-sweets had strip'd His orchard for the groaning pound; When with the first clear juice that drip'd He hied away, and Sally found. Sally (says he) dear maiden, sip!â She frown'd: he tried again to speakâ 'Tis sweet as honey to the lip!â He look'd as if his heart would break. And then he sought the dark-green lane Whose willows mourn'd the faded year; Sighing (I heard the love-lorn swain) âWishness An expression used by the vulgar in the north of Devon, to express local melancholy. There is something sublime in this impersonation of Wishness.âah! Wishness walketh here!â EXTEMPORE LINES TO THE AUTHOR'S WIFE. December, 1793. Heaven's blessing on my dearest love! O may she joys unvaried prove Thro' all the changes of the year; Whether December's blast austere Shake our lone cottage, as the blaze Illumes its walls with cheering rays; Or whether May's delicious green Soften the little garden-scene; Or fervid August, 'mid the bower Cool with its fruits the roseate hour; Or calm we pass, afar from strife, The October of a private life; Or yet our quiet we retain When wintry storms come round again! LINES READ TO THE MISS S?, &amp;c. ON A WATER-PARTY FROM S?S. 1792. To soothe each poor neglected maid, Who loads the winds of the parade With sighs, for Simon or for Simpson (Abortive sighs, that reach not L?e, Though L?'s beaux might suit so well The zenith of a S?s belle) The Muses, ever prone to pity, Would pour the love-devoted ditty. Yet every maiden cries outââPish! âWhat can the Muses do, but wish?â Too true: and though they've wish'd so long, Their offspringâit is allâa song. Yet shall the Nine, my girls, produce Some good, and prove of solid use, While in your lovely forms they rise, And stream their radiance from your eyesâ While shines, Sophia, bright in thee, The lively, gay Terpsichore, Who, smiling as her steps advance, Lightly threads the sportive danceâ While the Muse of pensive air, In thee, Louisa, still more fair, Beams from those lids a gentle ray; And melting in a lovelorn lay, Tho' the tenderest of the Nine, Boasts not a voice so sweet as thineâ Whilst Urania, fond to shew Her heavenly attributes below, Eliza, to our sense imparts, In thee the type of spotless hearts; That placid look, that wish to please, That affability and ease, That openness so free from guile, That meekness, such as angels smile! Why stops my verseâin such a pother Why hesitate, as if no other Were worthy of the mighty honor To take the Muse for once upon her? Where is Calliope? Where Clio? Where is Euterpe? Why demur? The Virgins of S?s will sigh âO! â'Tis hard to stomach such a slur!â Trueâwhen, in Sunday-cloaths start forth, Too luminous to touch the earth, Of blazing beauties such a host, Whose orbs, on other days, are lost!â That, as the Sabbath-sun goes down, Strait re-assume the russet gown, And, though on days of rest, fine ladies, Shew us, on Mondays, what their trade is; While, lutestrings bright lock'd up, Miss Jenny Behind the counter turns a penny; Or, though a vapourish Polyhymnie, Cuts, many a rasher deep, the flitch in, Adorning with her hams the chimney, In the meridian of a kitchen. But comeâwe need not stoop so low, As if for subjects at a loss: Still may the Nine their boons bestow Amidst the gentry of S?s. Perhaps, the hearts of men to win, sent By the fine features of Miss V?t, Can they, a moment, cease to ape The graces of her polisht shape, And, as her figure they assume, Light up her cheek's unfading bloom? Say, will they not delight to rustle Soft in the sattins of Miss B?l, Her vocables so pretty, mincingâ Nodding her airy plumes and wincing? Thrown aside her tragic pomps, I see Melpomene in romps! Yet lo! a Muse of finer texture As palpitates her bleeding heart, Kneels down, with tremulous genuflexure, And prays to be assign'd her part. 'Tis Eratoâthe Muse of loveâ With sighing virgins hand and glove; Quick through their bosoms as she rushes, And kindles with new fire their blushes. But (lest this Erato should put her, Poor maiden! in too great a flutter) Behold, she dares not, at her peril, Inspire the form of Mary T?l; A form by nature's self array'd, By the delighted graces deckt; That wants not any Muse's aid To give it interest or effect; Where as the countenance beams forth Instinctive sense and genuine worth, And the submitted eyeâthe cheek (Suffus'd with mantling blushes) speak More eloquent than wordsâwe see Thy triumph, sweet Simplicity! And may those beauties quickly rivetâ Not such a bosom, as in sly men Oft turns upon caprice's pivot, But a sound heart dovetail'd by Hymen! THE TOMB OF ROUSSEAU. Thanks to These lines were addressed to Miss Eliza S? on her presenting the author with a drawing of Rousseau's Tomb in the Isle of Poplars, just before her departure from S? to the Isle of Wight, on July 10, 1793. Eliza's art, that trac'd This fairy spot in colors clear; Pure as her own enlighten'd taste, And soft as melting pity's tear. Romantic isle! Thy poplars wave Their gloom, to please a parted shade: And yet they tremble o'er the grave Where a cold Deist's bones are laid. What tho' they whisper to the breeze Plaints that might soothe the ear of love; As Halcyon stills the ruffled seas, Or warbling woodlark charms the grove; They murmur but to waken pain, Where Virtue holds no quiet sleep: They touch the gentle soul in vain, Where blushing virgins dare not weep. Yet shall I love the Elysian isle That oft may rise, in kind relief, To bid me catch Eliza's smile, And calm, by Fancy's aid, my grief. And when far off the bark shall bear Her form from this forsaken shore; When my poor widow'd heart shall share Eliza's sympathy no more; Haply the pencil'd scene may move To memory dear, a thousand sighsâ But ah! that Tomb can only proveâ The type of all my buried joys! EUGENIUS. I Within a deep secluded glen Where a path, sloping from the embattled dome, Gleam'd, and then vanish'd in an oaken gloom, Eugenius thro' the shade of night Retiring from the haunts of men, Oft hail'd a spectre-groupe by the moon's wandering light. II âGhosts of my fathers (would he cry) âI muse upon each venerable form, Whether you meet the spirit of the storm, âOr glide in stillness thro' those oaks!â âE'en now I see you from on high âDescendingâyou alone my pensive soul invokes. III âNear yon white rock, I bid aspire âThat sacred Mausoleum to receive âThis frame, when the frail sons of clay I leave âTo greet your never-dying train! âThen shall I join that valorous sire, âThe haughty-helmed chief who fell on Cressy's plain.â IV Thus would he cry; and roving wild As any maniac, tread the glimmering dale; Nor seek his mansion till the stars grew pale Before the kindling blush of day; When, as if watchful of his child, The hoary-headed groom trac'd out his master's way. This is scarcely an outline: it would be easy to draw a very strong portrait of a gentleman, whose singularities are ridiculed by the inconsiderate and regarded with pity by reflecting minds. But, in reverence to his many virtues and amiable qualities the author has noticed only two traits of his characterâhis believing in the communion of the living with the deceased, and his fondness for frequenting a deep glen just below his house, at midnight, where he has actually built a Mausoleum for his tomb, and where he believes that he often meets and converses with the spirits of his ancestors.

O with the robe of honor be thou cloth'd And with perfection's garment, to the seat Of eloquence ascending, or the shrine, The sanctuary of God! Thus all thy tribes Shall hail thy lustre as the morning-star Divinely brightâas the full moon's clear orb; As the sun shining on the temple-dome Of the most High; and as the rainbow's hue Coloring the darkness; as the spring's soft shower Of roses; as the lilies by the stream, And, as the tree of frankincense, what time The summer glows; as the fair olive-boughs Budding forth fruit, and as a cypress, high Above the groves, and spreading thro' the clouds! SONNET. FROST. June 1, 1795. Wooing the shadows of the morning moon See with rude influence pallid Frost hath chill'd The glimmering landscape, as in slumber still'd, It meets the first faint blush of orient June: Yet, with the lustre of the night's clear noon The stars a moment kindle, and then fade. Now opens to the sun the shivering scene, As to the north solanum's darker green Shrivels in blackness, and the barley blade Springs with a sickly sallowness, to shade The ridgy groundâas the pale hawthorn screen Hangs, hoar with rime, its scanty blooms between, And the rill crackles, where we cross the glade, Tho' glittering to the solar orb serene! SONNET TO A TOAD. Tho' loathsome thou appear, 'tis said, Thou âhid'st a jewel in thy head!â But why, my Toad, should we recur To vulgar tales thy credit to support? Come forthâand who would throw on thee a slur Shall own, thou hast good reason to retort! Come, nor within that ivied nook, Resign thy beauty to the brook! Lo, not the maid, for whom so cruel Poor Colin heaves incessant sighs, Boasts such a lustre as illumes thine eyes! Then let us not too hastily condemn The old tradition of the jewel; Since in each eye we find the precious gem. SONNET TO AN ARTIST, EMPLOYED IN NEW-MODELLING THE PLEASURE-GROUNDS OF MY LORD ? Ah! what avails, fair Artist, to diffuse So bright a verdure o'er the swelling lawn; To guide the stream by gradual windings drawn Down the rich dale, or paint the wood with hues That seem to kindle, as amid the dews They dance, to catch the crimson of the dawn? Ah! what avails, that many a nimble fawn Wantons beneath the foliage, if the Muse Inspire not the possessor, fond to dart The eye of sympathetic pleasure round? Alas! the poor possessor hath no heart! To relish the beauties of nature, it is necessary to possess a good heart. Here lies in silence hush'd the untrodden ground, Tho' nature boast the elegance of art; Unless when vulgar notes to revelry resound! SONNET IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE REPRESENTATION OF THE TRAGEDY OF LILLO IN TOWN, When some middle-aged persons exclaimed, âIt is too deep!â Where is the sigh, the kind relieving tear? âAlas!â (the audience cries) âit is too deep!â Thrill'd by the stroke of agony severe, They gaze in blank suspence; they cannot weep. âWe who have known the pangs of real woe âThat oft from fiend-like machinations sprung; âWe, who have mark'd the bitter ills that flow âFrom vice, resign these portraits to the young. âYes! 'tis for minds unpractis'd in the world âTo view such pictures with a transient pain; âAnd tho' o'er Frenzy's wild a moment hurl'd, âYet feel no dizzy fever of the brain: âO'er the drear scene their lively fancy plays, âAnd gilds e'en horror's self with fairy rays.â TO THE EVENING-STAR. Meek Star of Eve, whose placid ray I prize beyond the blaze of day, O softly gild the waves that roll Dark o'er my agitated soul! So shall the charmed surge subside Into a gently-murmuring tide, Reflecting each affection kind, A faithful mirror of the mind. Yet, while no storm upheaves the sea, Far be a torpid calm from me! Unruffled tho' the current flow, Still may the whispering zephyr blow; Tho' Peace each tumult hush, may Love With balmy breath my bosom move! TO A YOUNG OFFICER, TOO FOND OF HIS LITERARY STUDIES. Ah why, my friend, perplex thy studious mind Thus unreliev'd, by Aristotle's page? Say, Henry, dost thou think the musing sage, If to his books, each live-long hour, confin'd, Could from his closet have inform'd mankind? Go, in the scenes of active life engage! Go, if thy country with apostates wage Portentous war, go bid thy lore combin'd With military skill, thy Albion aid! So shall the scholar's and the soldier's bays Wove to a double wreath, thy temples shade: So shalt thou gain the more distinguisht praise That Xenophon's or CÃ¦sar's worth repaid; And emulate the fame of ancient days! TO MISS S. WRITTEN IN MARCH 1792. While Elegance, unfolding o'er thy form Her airy vest with heaven's own tincture bright, Sheds on thy cheeks the vernal blushes warm, And radiates from thine eyes in lovely light; While in the sweetness of thy voice she owns Accents that from the trancing spheres she stole, And from thy harp elicits melting tones That speak the musick of the pensive soul; While by thy glowing pencil she portrays Angelic shapes, that beam the types of theeâ Regard the muse who sighs in soften'd lays, Attracted by thy moral harmony, To each fine tone the trembling spirit gives, Breathes but to catch thy glance, and in thy essence lives! TO COLMA. All is in silence husht. Where broke The storm, behold the ravag'd dale: While leaves the tinctured streamlet choak, Its banks are mark'd by circlets Fairy circles, probably occasioned by lightning. pale. Yet lo! the star of evening beams From the dark cloud emerging bright: And the dale cheer'd by pity seems; Its freshen'd verdure drinks delight. But when from Love's tempestuous whirl I rest a moment, woe is me! Alas! I catch, relentless girl, Of pity not a ray from thee! And O! that still suspence, my fair, Is but the pause of blank despair!â THE PASSIONATE LADY. The dimpled smiles, the stately mien Which mark the loves and beauty's queen In Daphne fair we find: And who perceives not, lucky hit! Diana's chasteness, Pallas' wit, Unite in Chloe's mind? But Dian chaste, nor Pallas wise, Nor, spite of her alluring eyes, The arbitress of love, So winning, wanton, debonnaire, With angry Phillis can compare, Who wields the bolts of Jove! Behold! to swell her rage, the god Who rules Olympus with a nod, Surrenders all his powers: His thunder now her voice inspires; Her flashing eyes confess his fires, Or quick dissolve in showers! THE CAPRICIOUS BEAUTY. Wilt thou, Emira, peerless maid, An honest truth approve; Nor close thine ear to Reason's voice Attun'd by softer love? Why are those witching looks that seem The effulgence of the soul, Darted with such a wild caprice On Granville, Allen, Hole? Thy sportive eyes on those who list Under thy magic banner, Too often hast thou, in my sight, Maneuvred in this manner. A languish from those lustrous orbs On sighing Granville thrown, He gazes with a fond surprize, And marks thee for his own. With eagerness he now prepares Again to catch thine eye: The rambler, drest in smiles, is fixt On Allen sitting by. Allen, in extasy, exclaims, âO Lady most divine!ââ But sudden sees the averted rays On Hole propitious shine. Ere Hole hath power to bless the glance, Alas! the glance is flown; And, beaming once on Allen more, Is back to Granville gone. You think your smiles subdue mankind: Emira! grant it trueâ The beauteous adder hath a sting, The body of a dead serpent bruised on the wound it has occasioned, is said to be an infallible remedy for its bite: common report is sufficient to warrant a poetical allusion. Yet bears a balsam too. SONG. [Where harebells had imbib'd the dew] Where harebells had imbib'd the dew And clos'd their cups, my limbs I threw: The silver lamp of Heaven shone bright; And my heart sicken'd at the sight. The winds blew shrill: a gathering cloud Flung o'er the moon its sable shroud; While large drops, like the tears I shed, Fell cold upon my naked head. âAh, darken'd orb, too plain I see âAn emblem of myself in thee; âWhile, chasing joy, affliction pale âDraws over me the sombre veil!â And now, before the rising blast, The clouds in scatter'd fragments past Far from the lunar disk, till clear'd From gloom, the splendid moon appear'd. Twinkled the glistening leaves more green, And soften'd lustre cloath'd the scene. âFair orb! 'tis thine again to smile; âBut my poor bosomâwoe the while! âAgain thy rays the landscape cheer; âBut joy no more shall brighten here!â SONG. [Long for his fair, delightful toil] Long for his fair, delightful toil, As summer ting'd the sapphire skies, Had Alleyn bid the garden smile, And mark'd its varied beauties rise. Here many a shrub its sparkling hue Flaunted amid the solar beam; There, its rich-tinted leaves withdrew To shade the silver-winding stream. Once, thro' the vegetable blaze As in fond trance the lover stray'd, He met Elvira in the maze, And thus addrest the blushing maid: âSurvey those flowering shrubs, my fair; âFull many a blossom may'st thou seeâ âYet less are all the blooms they bear âThan half the sighs I heave for thee!â TO JULIA, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE AUTHOR'S BREAKING HER FAN. 1793. Too sure, thy fan, malignant fate Impell'd me thus to breakâ Ah Julia! I perceive, too late, The fragmentsâwhat they speak! And canst thou, Julia, bid thy fan The cruel doom impart? Thy scorn, alas! do all I can, Thy scorn will break my heart! EXTEMPORE LINES ON A LADY'S LOSING HER EYELASHES BY AN EXPLOSION OF GUNPOWDER. The lightning, that beneath the shade Of each delicious eyelash play'd, So softly glanc'd upon my heart, I fondly nurst the thrilling smart.

See, Anna, see yon orb of light Diffuse the genial beam: All feel a vivifying heat, Tho' none in the extreme. But in a This passage does not allude to the small burning-glasses in common use, but those surprizing ones said to have been employed by Archimedes at the siege of Syracuseâsuch as consumed whole fleets of the Romans with all the men on board them, in an almost incredibly-short space of time. burning-glass collect The widely-radiant fires, And turn them on a mortal man: In flames the wretch expires. So, while the rays that light thine eyes, Alike on all are thrown; To all they give a gentle warmth, A heat intense to none. Yet, Anna, summon up thy charms, Tho' fierce the effulgence be! Yetâyet direct them to a point; And find that pointâin me. ODE TO BARON DE DUNSTANVILLE. 1796. I O say, what mean those splendors that illume Half the solitary plainâ That with a yellow stream the rock distain, Breaking thro' the midnight gloom? See, Carnbre! the effulgence spread In circles round thy monumental head; And, o'er yon' emerging grove Behold, with shadowy trail, the gradual glory move. II âSay, doth some spirit bid the desart hoar Kindle into joy again? Alas! the radiance of delight were vain, While their hallow'd names, no more, Pale Cornubia's worthies boast, But oft in stillness glides the shivering ghost, Pointing to dismantled walls Which once were castle-towers, and harp-reechoing halls. III Where now thy pristine grandeur, old Lanherne? Where thy storied gallery, bright With blazon'd huesâthy fretted roof's proud height? Prostrate amid matted fern Arches grey and pillars gleam; While from on high, the darkling owlets scream, As, across their secret nest, The gale shrill whistling shakes the turret's ivy-vest. IV Ah! where, Caerhayes! thy patriot sons were nurst, Deep the shades of silence broodâ Where flow'd thro' generous veins, Trevanion's blood! Where, Arwenack! wont to burst Thro' thy groves the festal song, Low whispers die, the quivering boughs among, And, oft, tremulous on the main, A moaning voice recalls the chief untimely slain. V And ah! Godolphin! what rude hands profane Haunts to warriors whilom dear, And, in thy spectred gloom, the pageant rear? Faint is each armorial pane! Pensile, whilst the dinted shield, The casque, wide-rifted in the sanguine field, And the heavy-rusted mail, Sigh to the tapstried walls and each dim hero hail. VI And, Carminow! where now thy knightly days? Days that my rapt soul entrance; That, as the floating visions of romance, Re-appear, in magic rays! See the sculptur'd chief repose Where the dank fane its charnel horror throws: Gleam his hollow eyes of stoneâ Hah! from the broken tomb I heard a chilling groan!â VII But whither does my frenzied fancy stray?â âMore distinguish'd glows the rock; Starting as from a necromantic stroke Trembles all thy pile, Carnbre! Sudden from the chasmed ground A spirit rises, with the topaz crown'd! Flames his helmet! I behold His amber-clustering hair, his ermin'd robe of gold.
