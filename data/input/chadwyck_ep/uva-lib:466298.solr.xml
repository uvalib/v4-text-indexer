      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. UNICÃ SORORI MEÃ REQUIESCENTI IN SINU DEI. So this must go without thy guiding hand And thine approving eye into the world Which thou hast left; and not one page of this Is mark'd with thine own hand, as always wont, Alas! with me, nor thy dear voice hath told What to retain, and what to cast aside. Light of mine eyes, and art thou gone indeed? How many thousand days in our brief life, Morn after morn, thy well or ill hath been The well or ill to me, as if one life Upon one stem sustain'd us both in one; That, sever'd from thee thus by sudden stroke, I needs must droop awhile. Yet, O most dear! Spirit most dear! sure it is well with thee, And therefore now should needs be well with me; And so it would be if my earthly self Could but be buried with thee in the grave, And so my better soul with thee bear part. And henceforth it shall be so, if in me This passionate resolve, fed with the dew And rain of many tears, and with the breath Of many prayers sustain'd, may, by God's grace, Grow into something of enduring strength And purpose, while the pains of like disease As with the self-same nails hold to the Cross, Sorrow's true home, whereby the Blessed One Would bring us to Himself, and keep us there. Dear partner of my every joy and care, E'er since I knew what joy and care might be, From earliest childhood, henceforth to the end Such thoughts must travel, in the bosom pent, Unshared by thy sweet converse, and the glow Of souls by nature set in unison, With mutual sympathies, that seem'd all one In two, as veins that fed one twofold heart, Doubling those joys by making them thine own, And taking half the burden of those cares. O part of my own soul, so long endear'd That I remember not, from life's first dawn, When I have loved thee not, with such a love That ne'er knew less or more by change of time, With such entire affection, yet withal That on it Heaven approving seem'd to smile; For never spot or cloud hath intervened To dim that mirror where thine image lies, That thou alone of all whom I have loved Hast left no sting behind of self-reproach, For lack of earnest love or fitful change. Were I to think of thee as gone indeed, As gone for ever, then my heart would break; But when I deem of thee as gone before, A little while before, then hope revives, And earnest longing to prepare and be More like thyself, and reverential fear Of Him in whose near Presence dwell the dead, And that abiding-place which changes not. Then oft it seems as thou wert with me still, Behind the thinly interposing veil Unseen awhile, yea near and nearer still Thou art to me, and seemest, as by prayer I hold communion with our mutual Lord, Who heareth prayer; in that assurance blest With thee I am, and then am comforted; And haply from thy prayers are those sweet drops That lighten my sad heart, for sure I am Thy love hath not grown cold, thy love for me, But rather doth intenser burn more near The countenance of Him whose name is Love. And now my thoughts which ever turn'd to thee To bear each passing good or bosom grief, Oh! not cut off from thee shall be those thoughts, But purified and hallow'd, while to Him They turn the more, within whose bosom now Thou findest full thy long-accustom'd rest; There would I turn the more, and finding Him Find thee in Him restoredâno longer lostâ Not lost, but more than found. Yet here awhile I look for thee in vain, and see thee not; I know not what thou art, nor where thou art, But that thou art with Him, in whom on earth Thy life was hidden. This forbids to mourn But for myself, that am so far away From what I would and should be, yet am not. Then what if Time shall measure to the end The void he cannot lessen, yet that void May yet be fill'd, be more than fill'd, with thee; If those sweet daily hours to thee I lent Be henceforth given unto my God alone, So might thy death be more than life to me. For thou didst ever choose the better part, Which is not ta'en away. At midnight came The Bridegroom's voice, whom none beheld so near; Sudden He came, nor found thee unprepared. For thou wert ever wont to be as one In readiness to hear thy Master's call, While I was more like him in the cold grave, And so came on my ear those sacred words, âMary sat still, till she the summons heard, âThe Master calleth thee!ââthen rose and went:â The Master, He is come, is come to raise Thy brother from the dead.â Oh, be it so! And so may I again to thee be given, Thy more than brother, ne'er again to part. It was one wintry night, that night I pray'd Some fiery trial, whatsoe'er it be, Might burn out all the fibres of my sin. I fear'd and pray'd, and fearing pray'd again, Doubtful if I could bear the fiery test, Knowing not whence perchance it might come home. Thy cheerful words were with me on that eve, Sent to me, as was wont, in thy sweet love; But when I woke at morn I found thee gone; The dayâthe dark, dark day that I had fear'd From infancy, had comeâand thou wert not. Oh, that my prayer might rise, and rising blend With the strong, tearful cry by Cedron's brook, Heard in that garden in the dead of night! Oh, that the drops of sad Gethsemane Might be on this my sorrow, that it be Not all in vain, but I may wake to hear That voice Divine, which calls to watch and pray In fellowship of suffering, and which hears That cry, âFather, Thy will, not Mine, be done!â Sweet, tender flower that we had housed so long, And watchÃ¨d o'er thee with so many fears,â So long, that I remember not the time When I have watch'd thee not, and fearful oft Have look'd for thy sake to each passing cloud, And trembled, lest it should lay low thy head, And all my life with thee, upon the ground. Sweet, tender flower which we have watch'd so long, For forty summersânay, I rather say For forty winters, for the summer-time Had always more of hope, and the warm bloom Would then return and kindle thy soft cheekâ For forty years have I thus o'er thee watch'd, With such unvaried trembling, that to me My days of gladness have been those that brought Tidings of thee; and 'mid the joys of life, With all its changes, chief hath been to me The sunshine and the light which seem'd to fall Between the clouds too wont to hang on thee, And thy dear, tender life;âso frail and weak, As ever ready on the ground to fall At each rude blast, but for our sakes awhile Sustain'd, while Mercy set aside the blow. Delicate flower, that I have loved so long And watch'd, until my very life hath seem'd A watching o'er thee! yet upon one stem We grew together, that the dew which fell On one upon the other trickled downâ The ray that fell on one the other cheer'd; Or rather might I say, so hast thou been Always one heart to meâone soulâone lifeâ That it hath rather been as when perchance Nature two rising flowers or hanging fruit Moulds into oneâtogether, as by change Of purpose she had made and form'd in one What she design'd for two. So am I left Half of myself, as one that long had lean'd A feeble frame, and finds his stay withdrawn. What though associate souls, new tender ties, And children branch around me, not as thou Link'd and inwreath'd with early memories, For I have lived without themânever yet Lived without thee till now, ne'er yet in aught Of my remember'd life, though born before A few short summers, and it may be yet A few short summers to remain behind. But all thy life to me, as back I trace, Is gentle, sad reproof; for as a child Thou wert as one that knew no other wish But to sit meekly at thy Saviour's feet, While I was dazzled by the opening world, And would have drawn thee thence, though even then, Soothed by thy love, so great and wonderful, That gave whate'er it had, nor aught retain'd, In self-denying meekness; by thy love Cheer'd as a healing spell and charm'd awhile Of that self-hatred which should have been mine; For if thou lovest me, then God might love, I fondly deem'dâyet sinfulâin my sin. Thus by the love and friendship of the good We cheat ourselves of goodnessâyet the while That love was but the kindling light of truth Which still reproved me,âfor such meekness spoke The Fount from which it flow'd; yet such reproof Was gentle as the morning wind that shakes The sleep-pent flower, and bids his bosom ope To kindly-falling dews; and haply then Thy prayers might have obtain'd that aid Divine Which interposed and cross'd my path of sin. Dearest, still ever didst thou seem at rest In ceaseless suffering, as a vessel toss'd That lay at anchor, while a hidden strength Kept thee 'mid winds and waters at repose. From very childhood thou wert always one Sway'd not by the outer world; array'd within With that meek spirit which is prized of God; Serene in thoughtful kindness to the last, For as we live we die; that treasure hid Which was thine early choice, was not despoil'd By changing years nor by the hand of death. And oh! that He that made thy life to be My light, may make thy death to be my health! But Nature for awhile will come between And cannot yet recall thee without tears, And retrospective memories that wake A thousand tender images, and fill All things with grief, as filling all with thee. Thy picture o'er me stood and look'd on me,â I knew it, yet my eyes I dared not raise, But hasten'd thence heart-stricken, nor e'en now Can venture to behold the canvas cold Which is, and yet which is not, thy dear self. So wither'd was my heart, and dry, and cold, That soon the frame that cased it would, methought, Have laid itself beside thee in the grave; But when at length I saw thy wonted haunts, The seat where thou should'st be, but thou wert not, Then did the smitten Rock flow forth within, Refresh my heart with tears, and wash with dew Thy recollections, that the past might be No more a wilderness of barren grief. And now I start to find myself the same; I fear'dâand what I fear'd hath come to pass, And yet I liveâand am as I was wont, Go in and out, and sleep, and rise from sleep. No longer shall thy friends around thee share In thy dear welcome, which made glad thy house, And that meek calm of spirit which was thine. No longer shalt thou hear the matin song Of early birds, or well-remember'd tune Of choral chant so sweet, and thoughts of Heaven It brought around us; but partaker made Of that which is âfar better,âânot to walk With marble feet on pavement lit with stars, Thresholds of heavenly palaces, but rest Upon thy Saviour's bosom with thy God. No longer labour with thy painful breath, No longer tremble at the sounds of war For those that unto thee were dearest held, But rest in Sabbath of eternal peace. Oh! never to have loved or ne'er to part, This were an earthly wish; such love hath not Its price on earth; it is of heavenly growth; By pain made doubly dear, with closest ties Inwreath'd with all our being round the heart: And now by death, oh! broken not in twain, But sanctified by death, and cherish'd still, And ever to be cherish'd and kept safe; Guarded from death, and all things else that harm, By love that ânever faileth,â for such love In love of God is raised, is purified; And therefore made enduring yet in Heaven, And to partake of His eternity. Thus still I feel thee near, although so far, Like the soft star that glimmers in my room: So far, that I can never see thee more; So near, I in an hour may be with thee. And changes o'er thee pass'd while still with us; Such changes as time brings upon us all: From infancy to childhood, and each stage Through summer and through autumn of our life; From blade to plant, from plant to bud and flowerâ Changes on thy dear countenance and form, And gradual changes on the mind within. Yet through those changes was thy love unchanged, And thou wert still the same; and therefore still, Through whatsoe'er of change thy spirit knows, Doubtless the same art thou and thy dear love. We know not what we are, nor what thou art, But thou dost know thyself, and know thy God. We know not what we are, nor can we judge Of any thing around us in our sin; Cheated by false, unreal semblances, Things are beyond us, and we therefore mourn. The stars to us appear to rise and set, The sun to sink upon his Western bed, As if he were not; and to us he leaves Nothing but night and darkness for awhile. But 'tis not so with him; he travels on To other shining lands, knows nought of night And darkness, which to us his dying leaves; For these terrestrial clogs impede our thoughts His glorious flight to follow;âwhat to us Is West and gloomy darkness is to him The Eastern morn which on his steps attends. The changing seasons bring to thee no change, For thou art safely housed by God Himself From wintry winds and summer heats. Henceforth Our Sacred Seasons know thee now no more, As they still lead us on from stage to stage Unto that City which shall know no change, Lit by the Lamb whose Light is endless Love,â Love, that doth âcast out fearââfear, oft below Companion of the seasons in their change, Depressing thy meek spirit with the weight Of its own lowliness, which often droop'd Its head to earth, in very meekness bent; As if it loved the ground, nor heard the chant Of heaven-inspirÃ¨d birds; now lifted up To gaze upon the face of endless Love, With no obstructing cloud, it droops no more, But lifts its voice in the eternal song. The changing seasons bring to thee no change; Would that to me their changes, one by one, Might ope new plants of healing at my feet, New stars above my head, which light and fill The stable firmament that knows no change, Whereby yet Mercy may restore my soul. And oh! it is surpassing sweet to know, In changes which mark all we love on earth, That there is One on whom, yet more and more, Our love may live, and feed on; to whom we May daily, hourly, and each minute turn; Who changes not. Oh! these affections strong, Which cling to those around us, make to be As hands and feet that seek and feel for that Which may sustain and never fail our love, And be the immortal spirit's home and rest! For Thou wilt be to us,âthey are Thy words,â For Thou wilt be to us as Mother, Thou Sister and Brother. O most blessed words, How do they sound in this my grief! And thou, Meek spirit, whose remembrance is so dear, To Him, whose love alone can fail us not, Upon the bosom of His boundless love I leave thee and myself; new every morn His mercies, and in them I will rejoice. Easter, M.D.CCC.LIV. THE CHRISTIAN SEASONS. Advent. Upon a dim and clouded wintry morn I watch'd a little bird that sat alone Upon a leafless branch of an oak tree, Lifting a sweet but solitary note; And then it look'd about, as if awhile Expectant of an answer; but full soon Another sounded from a neighbouring wood, Another and another; then anew He would the strain repeat, and wait again; Till many slender voices join'd the call With something of sweet sadness, rather say Sweetening the sadness of the coming on Of winter with a cheering note of trust. Thus they that fear the Lord in the dark day Shall often one unto another speak In voices sad and low, yet such withal As shall bring comfort to the evil time, And God shall bow His ear, and hear their sighs, And write them in His book, and on the day When He makes up His jewels, on that day He shall remember them: they shall be His. The song of birdsâhow oft it seems to meet Our spirits in their sadness, and reprove! Thus that low note came like a prophet's voice, Predictive of clear skies and open days. I know of nought in nature which more speaks The tender mercies and the love of God, Than do those feather'd strains. When we are sad, And some bereavement or depressing weight Hath prison'd us and darken'd all our day, That voice, on air or bough, hath a strange charm, Because it speaks of God, brings to the heart Whispers from Him in this our fallen world, Like Christ's own parable: He seems to say, âHear ye the birds, their little lives are brief, And long their winters, yet they speak of One, Who is their God and yours, and that He is A God of consolation and of hope.â And now 'neath wintry leaves, which linger still, The buds are hid of the new vernal year; And thus the Spirit and the Bride repeat, âThe Night is now far spent, the Day at hand,â On each returning Advent, which anew Breaks, ere the sun hath closed his annual course, The year of Grace ere Nature's year hath pass'd. E'en so the Evangelic morn itself, That ushers in the kingdom, hath begun The everlasting cycle of new years, Ere yet the waning world hath reach'd its end. Heaven's hallow'd morning hath commenced ere yet Night muffles up the eye of this world's day, Beginning ere the end, beginning that Which knows no end; for the eternal dawn Is even now purpling the Eastern hills, While Evening lingers in the vale below; And on the mountain heights the feet are seen Shod with the silver tidings of the Morn. Thus, too, before the going down of life, May the meek Advent of the Son of Man, The kindlings of His Graceâthe morning starâ The preparations of a better life, Cheer the sad setting of this worldly scene; On tearful retrospections of the past, With other hopes which are not of the night, Lighting the rainbow of a brighter day. 'Tis Advent! and as men that half asleep Hear the cock crow the watches of the night Before the Day-star, and then turn again Their weary sides and dream; then hear anon The larum of another watch gone by: So hears the world that call which says, âHe comes!â And turns again to sleep. Oh, may we hear As Peter heard that sound, nor hear in vain! What shall it be, and when? that one great Morn! This is the age of Knowledge, can she tell Nothing of that? From bowels of the earth In which she delves for jewels and for gold,â From stars she climbs and walks, hath she brought home No glimpse, no ray to tell us of that Light? No! it shall be as if men, who had known Nought but a dungeon of enduring dark, Were suddenly to see the summer sun Rising in all its glory, on the hills, Valleys, and streams, and men: like this shall burst The Day of days. We know not how, nor when; But this we know, most soon, most suddenly: So soon, 'tis said to be already come; So suddenly, that all shall be amazed: For that its coming shall be like the net Brought by a fowler on a moonlight night Upon a feather'd flock in harvest-field. Wonderful are God's works we now behold, The altitudes of mountains and their bulk, Their broad magnificence, their climbing Heaven, Clothed with the sun, while shadows on their side Majestic move in wild sublimity, Enlarging, yet subduing, hearts with awe. Wonderful, too, the Sea with all his ways: His solitary vastness never still, Whether it be on some tempestuous night, Foaming on high against the angry rocks, Or sleeping in the placid summer noon; With all his sounds and marvels of the deep, Ennobling our imaginings, himself The mirror of omnipotence amid The little ways of artificial life. And wonderful Night's star-illumined roof, Hung with its silver lamps, like some vast shrine; The dark-blue waste on fire with pearl-white orbs, Like jewels in the bottom of the deepâ An amphitheatre of living eyes, With strange unearthly brightness looking on, As gifted with serene intelligence. Ranging in measured bounds of space and time, Yet so exceeding vast, as if design'd The eternal and the infinite to speak: For in those fires, as in the Burning Bush, We see and hear the Everlasting Name. And wonderful the creatures of God's hand, Surrounding us with their instinctive ways, In greatness and in littleness, alike Unfathomable both. And wonderful Is man in all his mould of mind and frame; The spirit with its fleshly garb inwreath'd, So simple, yet so complicate in both, Fashion'd a living temple without hands. So wonderful is all we see of God, Intricate paths of wisdom without end, From less to less, from great to greater still. Such things declare what wonders beyond all The day of God's great wisdom will reveal; How wonderful beyond all wonders then Must be that day which is the day of God, When all His wisdom and His Providence, And all His attributes of great and good, Shall fully be made known and manifest To all the sons of God throughout all worlds: That Day of Days that waiteth at the door. It needs must be so, and the morning light Suddenly breaking on a man born blind Must be of such a feeble counterpart; And therefore all man's speculative thoughts, Of what it may or what it needs must be, Are arrows shot forth in the dark. That flash Lightning-like may expand the universe, The landscape that hath no horizon's verge, The day which hath no evening at its close, Infinite space, and time too infinite, And the before and after of all worlds; Nay moreâvast worlds which all about us lie, Of which we know not now, and cannot know. For of His wisdom now we see below But glimpses in the dark, and by our sin Made scant and profitless; but then shall be The wisdom of all wisdom fully known. Then shall these frames be changed and glorified;â But what is glory? whence the ideal gain'd? From glory of the world and things therein, Or that which dwells within the glittering tower Of gold upon the head. Or it may be We think of glory as a blaze of light Beyond all brightness, dazzling as the sun. Yet there is glory in a dim obscure, As sometimes in the silence of the night, Or hornÃ¨d moon of an autumnal eve, Sublimer than the effulgence of the day. Then if the sun, with all this colour'd scene He lights, be not sufficient for the theme Of this great argument, then let us take Midnight for our companion by the way, The moon shall be our lamp, and let us blend Our meditations with the awful stars. But what are they? No more than shining spots Of silver in the dark. But then no doubt Our faculties shall waken to perceive, Or faculties be new vouchsafed withal To enter in all wisdom, and to know Our gain or loss! Then with a dread surprise, Joyful or sad, beyond all joy or grief, With wing of lightning and a thunder tongue, Shall come the Thought that meets the wakening soul; In that new sunshine, things that seem'd erewhile Most solid shall be seen to melt and move, Moulding themselves as clouds, and pass away. For death is as the night that wraps in sleep, Though dread in the magnificence of stars; But resurrection is as rising morn, With keys that ope the palace of the sun. For not of death, but Judgment, speaks the voice Of Scripture, when the Sun of Righteousness, In whom the spirits of the righteous sleep, Shall unveil on the regions of the dead His locks encircled with eternal Day. Hence morning unto morning tells the tale Of resurrection, oft as dawning light Breaks, like a new creation of the world, Which folds and puts away the Heavens that were. Though great and little are alike with God, Yet then His wisdom and omnipotence In twofold form will overwhelm our thoughts, In greatness and in littleness. In these We trace them now with wonder and amaze, Until we come to limits of our sense, Branching into the Infinite and lost. Alps and Atlantic Oceans, mountain heights, The moving wastes of water, skies and suns, The multitudinous array of night, Down to the speckled shell, the wild sea-weed, Or antler'd insect ranging on the leaf. In greatness and in littleness, for thus Where Revelation holds her mirror up Kingdoms of grace respond to things we see: In greatness, for it speaks of deathless death In a consuming fire that goes not out, For ever and for ever without endâ A gulf that has no bottom where they fall. It speaks in words determinate and full Of being fashion'd as the sons of God, Made like the angels which can never die, Of dwelling for eternity with God; And that the opening to this state shall be The lifting of the curtain suddenly To see this theatre of things that are, With earthquakes usher'd in, and with the Heaven Falling with earth together, like a house With roof and walls tumbling in midst of flames, And sun and stars of this great universe Dropping like figs when shaken from the tree. And this the language and the words of God I thus interpret, that it shall be vast As to transcend all present faculties, As we shall then have given us power to know. For now, when we would measure works of God, They leave us soon behind without the means To follow, hedged about with the Divine, Encompass'd with a sea without a shore. But then we shall be gifted with wing'd powers, Able to traverse them to an extent Of which we deem not now, and into which These words, which are of God, would lead us on As near as our weak thoughts have power to go. Againâalike it is in littleness;â The vast and the sublime, if I may speak, Do here extend as far as to the height, And breadth, and length, thus go down to the deep; For in the written record given of God 'Tis interspersed throughout with words that speak Of Judgment so minute, that it transcends Our thought, and it may be our feeble faith, As much as in the vastness of the signs, The consequence and dread concomitance.â Words daily spoken in a balance weigh'd, Thoughts long since pass'd into the Judgment brought, Each deed connected with vast recompense, Each day that passes coming up again, Each light companion as a witness seen, Each trivial chance as some great providence, Bread cast upon the waters found again, A little one a thousand,âpassing word, And passing thought, the hour of prayer, the clock, The cup but of cold water;âmany thus The statements which to follow up and trace Were like to search out hues and arteries Upon a creeping insect scarce discern'd, To track the spider's labyrinthine web, Or through its hidden ways and windings wild The gnat, as far as human thought can go. Yet then I doubt not that there is implied In declarations such as these from God, That He will ope a mirror in the mind, Or with His hand the curtain thence remove, Which now o'erhangs the same beneath the soul, And, letting in a sunbeam from His throne, Reveal all our true selves unto ourselves, And to each other, e'en as known to God. And this I doubt not,âthat the written words Are nearest to the truth, and that 'tis vain For our conjectures and imaginings To calculate on modes how it may be. And on this theme the rather would I dwell, For that I know full well that where my faith Hath totter'd or hath fallen, it hath been In failing to hold fast and realize The greatness and the littleness of life,â The greatness of the things that are to be, The littleness of things from which they spring,â The greatness and the littleness which are In ways of God among which now we dwell; And the false estimate of both of these Which in the heart the world instils, whene'er It fills it, making little things appear As great, and greatest things exceeding small, Magnitudes without end thus dwindling down, With a mote hiding some transcendent star. For this our life seems great, while yet we live, Because with it a soul is conversant Which hath its own eternity within; And so unconsciously exalts the things Of this small day and night with which it deals, Casting on them, as they pass by to nought, Its own intrinsic dignity; and thus Investing meanest objects of this life Falls down and worships themâthe nameâthe goldâ The farmâthe merchandiseâthe high estate. Because itselfâin image made of Godâ Its dread reality, its boundless power, Its immortality it puts on them; Thus in them sees the shadow of itself, The shadow of its God; and therefore bows And worships for a greatness not their own. For whence the charm of glory, or of wealth? 'Tis Heaven reflected in a watery drop, Which men behold, enamour'd of the sight; And chaining down their faces to the ground In that the image of the eternal place Yearn for the substance, and with prone-bent brows So turn their backs for ever on their God, Beholding but reflections of His light. Again; when looking on the times gone by, Of tenâor fiftyâor an hundred yearsâ Short, dwindled down they seem, and dwarf'd in space, As the same soul into the Eternal Year Expands her wing, infinite as itself. Hence is the greatness and the littleness Of this our life; thus God Himself comes down In lowliness to the small day and hour, And accidents of our mortality,â The Babe at Bethlehem and the Eternal Word. And if âour life be hid with Christ in God,â This daily life we live, yet as in God It must be great, although in little things, As shall be known in that the Day of Days. Moreover, love itself makes all things great, Exalting by itself whate'er it fills; Such is parental, such is bridal love, And such is love Divine; by its sweet touch Making most precious what had else no worth, Ennobling what was mean, and what was low Uplifting, and refining what was gross. For love holds keys of Heaven, and love of Hell, Although she feeds awhile on little things. Love is true wisdom; love commands the willâ The will which moves and moulds the human soul. For He who treasures up the widow's mite, Notes in His book the lightest boon of love, As done unto Himself, and therefore great. He knows our every care, our every want, And numbers every hair upon the head, Seeking of us such love as He bestows. Hence was the Jew's offence that fell of old, Who would not see his God in David's son,â The Infantâthe Cross-Bearer; mainly this, He could not separate what Prophets' words Had interwoven so and wrought in one, The first and second Coming; could not deem Of littleness and greatness so combined, As we count great and little; because Love Was absent, which alone adjusts the scale. And therefore till this day not understood The Lord hath with him left that parable, To which there is no key but that of love: âHow is it David in the Spirit calls Him Lord, on the right hand of God enthroned Till all things shall be placed beneath His feet?â Yet further: this I deem must be the causeâ The greatness and the littleness of things Which are to be reveal'dâthat lowliness On this our state as needful for all men Is so inscribed in awful characters, In characters of blood, the Blood of God. Therefore 'tis the foundation and the crown Of all in man accepted on that Day. For that he then shall know his littleness Amidst the boundless universe of God, Creations on creations then disclosed, His place in the vast family of God, So small, yet not a wish to go beyond; And it may be his littleness e'en now 'Mid unseen beings which environ him, And of which all unconscious he lifts up His bold front unto Heaven, of that great truth Unmindful, what his fall hath been from God. And then too of his greatness man shall know, Which shall o'erwhelm him with all lowliness And self-abasement, as of one new-made In God's own image, risen from the grave; The greatness of the Love that came from Heaven To put on fleshly ills; of which e'en now We hear and read, yet cannot understand. So much the ways of God transcend our thought, Knowing we are as those who know them not, Save in faint glimmerings which through our flesh His Spirit to our spirit may disclose. That Love which came from God's own secret place, And with our inmost selves makes itself one In fellowship divine and brotherhood, Union of heart with our heart, friend with friend, Brother with brother, and about our path Sharing our cares and wants,âthose things which now We read and hear and speak of, yet the while In reading, hearing, speaking, are as those Who know notâcannot knowâas needs must be When thus the earthly speaks of the Divine. But then that greatness of ourselves reveal'd Throughout the things of earth and times gone by, E'en in exalting shall make doubly low, As an unwonted greatness when made known Depresses with the weight, by contrast felt, And conscious knowledge of unworthiness. But these are speculations blind and weak Of such things as we know there are to be, How they then may or must be; for although While the world fails, from the eternal place Light may break in through this our earthly house As it gives way, but through the mouldering chinks Athwart, askance the radiance falls, and makes Fantastic shadows in the dubious dark, That we mistake their semblance. Yet withal Not altogether profitless to dwell On such anticipations God hath given, And interwoven now with our frail life, Lights that with His own written Word conspire To teach us wisdom. I remember well When I was sitting by the door of death, Where fever left me, having drunk my strength; By the fireside I sat, while one most dear Read some light passing story, as perchance Might soothe the o'er-wrought spirit. 'Twas a tale That spoke of childhood and of boyish time. But in me there appear'd to wake anew The spirit of my early childish years,â Associate with the things of which it spake,â With such unwonted tenderness, that all My soul seem'd that again of a small child; With recollections which around me came;â A long lost mother and a world of things Arose, with all their own remember'd scenes;â That it became an hour which ever since Hath been like some clear spring, which hidden long In marshy under-ways or verdant mead, Steals forth again into some cradling rock O'ergrown with moss and ivy and wild flowers, Crystal-like pure, and with a trickling sound Forth issues as a fountain-head renew'd. E'en so that hour of reminiscence old Came welling forth afresh, and still remains, Amid the garden of my life gone by, A fountain full of tears,âand yet of tears With love so mingled that it seems to pour A freshness upon feelings worn and dry, To which still Memory turns. For 'twas an hour That cannot pass away; an hour that woke From childhood, childhood's hour in after days. Now this, methought, might lead one to divine How our past life might wake beyond the grave, With strange, still voice, or picture-like return. It may be suddenly that Memory's self, With some new powers of Resurrection born, Or as a cloud removed this fleshly veil, Like a fresh sheet of light that passes not, May clothe our spirits, glassing them about With an investing flame. Then may be seen That weaknesses which wrap us now around, Of time, of circumstance, of sense, of change, Yea intellect itself, with all its powers, Were accidents of being for awhile, But not its essence;âthings that needed were For our probation, and put on by us, The short-lived vestments of mortality, As human things were by our Lord Himselfâ Necessities of our small finite state And nature, bound to time and place and thought, Our imperfections; yet howe'er it be, This, only this, I know that all the while I am as one that sitteth at the door Till I be beckon'd to come in, and pass Into that great unknown eternity, Which like the air compasses us all around; And for that change of being daily wait. Yet 'tis required that we should feed thereon, And for our meditation much is given, Great though our ignorance; for in this blank, This absence as of some mysterious sense Of which we know not, there are letters given And syllables which, like blind children, we May place together, and their language learn. Nay colours too, and outlines which afford A picture, faint indeed, yet true and sure, Which apprehended will approach as near To those realities which follow death As our frail thoughts and senses can attain: And nearest then we shall attain when most We shall adhere unto these symbols given; Though these expressions in themselves may be Perchance but signs and shadows:âof a Day, A Judgment-seat, and One that sits thereon, EnthronÃ¨d visibly before all worlds,â I doubt not that these words, though human words And ta'en from human things, yet to us paint That dread epiphany which is to be, In circumstance exact and tangible As our imaginings can ever reach, While we are darken'd with this veil of death. We see One 'neath a rainbow emerald-like Sitting upon a throne, for ever Man E'en as for ever God. Yea even more, He that in Spirit saw, in Spirit wrote, Hath thus pourtray'd,ââI saw a great white throne And Him that sat thereon, and from His face The earth and heaven took wings and fled away, And were not; small and great I saw the Dead Stand before God; the books were open laid.â Now though of books I deem not such as men And pen and ink have written, but thereby Suppose some wondrous record of the past Which would appal me, mirror-like in truth; Some strange unfolding of the secret soul As of a sealÃ¨d volume, in whose folds Are written the intentions of the past Which clothed themselves in deedâin wordâin thought,â And it may be the unhousing from this flesh Is breaking of that seal,âyet those plain words, Of the âwhite throne and Him that sits thereon,â No doubt approach the dread reality More near than other language could express. Therefore I read them, and I read again, And kneel and tremble, and in trembling pray, And then am comforted. And sweet it is From earthly hopes withdrawn to lose oneself In the mysterious awfulness of God, In whom our life lies treasured, while He works The power of resurrection in the soul; And then Himself would soul and body mould Like His own glorious Body free from death, When this vile body from her winding-sheet All âre-invested with white innocenceâ Shall stand before Him. If intentions now Write on the soul their unseen characters, Which the bright fire that on the Judge attends Shall then make legible, it needs must be Our highest work to strive to read them now By that same fire,âa fire which burns within His Spirit and His Word; with these to pray, For these, in these, and learn that fire of Love, For love is lumination, and from prayer Is the life-breath of love, the air of Heaven. But speculations of philosophy, Yea of diviner learning, it may be, Do lead us further from the truth of God In this which sets at nought all human thoughts,â As whether that Great Day might be indeed A thousand years, according as 'tis said, âA thousand years with Him are but a day;â Or whether all the past that then is weigh'd Be but the habits of the soul, which then Crystallized and transparent come to view. Such curious questionings may lead abroad, While the meek penitent on bended knees, With saintly Andrews, on the words of God Who trembles, reads, and prays, and praying weeps,â Nay, in yon rural cot by sylvan slope The sick man who hath read, or heard the words He cannot read, and o'er them night and day Praysâdoubtless he draws nearer to the light Which Angels have and Saints that are with God, Than learning can attain to, or the search Of keenest intellect which yearns to know Rather than do the will. Thence it may be Learned discourse and wisdom of the schools, With all its boasted eloquence, is weak To plant the light within that it may burn, Yea, weaker than the unletter'd preacher's voice Beside the village tree. As instincts lead The fowls of heaven to their appointed food, Insects and creeping things, beyond what art And reasoning man could teach them, Love Divine Knows its own way to its eternal good, Beyond the language and the art of man; For they are âchildren of the light,â the light That lighteth every man, no learned lamp Leads them, but humble love in duty wise. But nowâif of that greatness when reveal'd, The First-born from the Dead upon His throne Of glory, we can never deem aright, So far transcending all our faculties,â Whene'er the intellect would aught attain, And reach to heights which are beyond all height, And fathom depths which are beyond all depth;â But if to know ourselves, and know our God, To know the truth is to make low ourselves, To littlenessâto very nothingness; Then in this self-abjection may the soul Something bring home of truth in sinking down, As he that does the will the doctrine knows. Therefore I ween it is that thus our God Both Advents hath united in our thought, For preparation and for discipline, The King of Glory and the King of Woe, The Everlasting Godâthe Infant Child,â Our contemplations moulding on the First, That we may meet the Second. It is writ, âI by the ear have heard of Thee, but lo! Now mine eye seeth Thee, and at the sight I do abhor myself, and speechless made Repent in dust and ashes to the ground.â To climb the ladder of discover'd stars, Of suns on suns, systems on systems piled, Will bring not to the Holy Place of God; But to descend into a lowly heart Made contrite, self-abased, and mourning sin, Will find the secret place wherein God dwells, And give to see in Christ the Incarnate Son. 'Tis going down to the dark caves of earth That brings unto our view the starry Heavens, Else hidden by the glare of the rude Day; And 'tis before the Infant bowing low, And offering up ourselves and all we have, Kings are we made and Priests, meet to attend The Coming from the East, when it shall be. In comtemplations of that day unknown We are as lostâas they who lose themselvesâ Except in love of God as seen in Christ: The âcords of manâ that intertwine, inwreathe With all our being, enter into Christ: It is the living Christ is all in all; To Him all Scriptures draw; unto Himself As with a thousand ties; Him first, Him last, Him midst, Him throughout all and within all, Him all the way and end; on Christ to feed, On Christ to dwell, to meditate, to pray,â This is our light, our immortality. To one, one only, Future points the Hand Which beckons through all Scripture's varied page, The Coming and the Presence of the Lord. To âlove His comingâ is the ârighteous crown;â âTo live is Christ;â death is to âsleep in Christ;â And resurrection is to âsee the Lord:â Looking to HimâHim onlyâthus I would Possess my soul in patience, that it may Unruffled keep the image of my God, And in such stillness that the noisy world May not impede, nor drown His still small voice. And now I deem that works, as these may be, Of studious leisure and of sacred theme, Which, for dispensing good, through other hands And other eyes must pass and other hearts; And therefore seem to lift one to the seat Of wisdom and authoritative speech Above one's fellows, and to set apart, Somewhat withdrawn; these things, I fear, must be Full of their peril, lest they uplift the soul And by uplifting thrust it down more low, Upraised in our own sight, made low with God. Much too must be the peril to the soul Which by comtemplative and letter'd lore Would enter courts of light; for if the light Of knowledge should increase, and fann'd by pride Sever from charity, light without love, The greater condemnation will it be, And life at best laborious idleness. For minds that feed on sacred literature Are wont to move too fast, and so outstrip The moral and the strengthening of the soul, When life doth not with knowledge keep one pace, But duty lags behind, shorn by degrees Of lowliness and grace. Moreover add, The mind full bent and the intenser thought, Which any object thus pursued requires, However pure and holy be the theme, Leaves less of vacant leisure to the heart For the great work of lifeâunceasing prayer. Therefore, e'en more than others, such must need The prayers of all men; for ourselves we need, And more than others do we need to pray; Lest seeming wise we be with fools shut out, Miss of the wisdom unto babes reveal'd, And thinking to gain others lose ourselves. Christmas. Like music heard within the dead of night, Suddenly blending with our dreamy sleep, So Christmas breaks upon the cold dead world. Then let us wake from the absorbing round Of day and morrow, by the manger kneel In adoration of the Babe Divine, Listening for wisdom's voice, which is with God, And bear within our souls the angelic strain, To harmonize the jarrings of the world, The stirâthe politicsâthe noise of life. This is the shrine and secret place of God, Where He would hide us from the strife of tongues. My God, the Heaven of Heavens contains Thee not, Yet unto me Thou comest an Infant Child! Thine habitation is eternity, Before all worlds, yet now the shepherds ask, When was He born, and where? Thou hast put on Our minutes, hours, and days; the sun and moon Thy chroniclers of infant months and years. Wonderful sight! how does it fill the heart With music as of Heaven, beyond the thought Which man can understand, that âGod is Love.â Of our first Adam have we never read An infant in the cradle, but of Thee The Second, and in whom is our New Birth. Wisdom, 'tis said, with children at her knees Doth sit; nay, she henceforth herself shall teach E'en as a child, herself a little child. Thus hath He clothed Himself with our mean flesh, That we in Him may clothÃ¨d be with God, Born from above; hath clothed Himself with ills Which flesh inherits,âpains and poverty, Fasting and weariness, and sorrow's tooth Gnawing the mortal flesh, and in the soul The untold weight of its own heaviness, Saddest of ills that wait on sinful man; That our flesh might inherit things of God, Such things as He hath clothed with our frail flesh,â Tenderness and compassions, lowliness And purity of heart. The penalties He took, and cut off the entail of sin. Unknown to all around, the new-born child, Cast out on the bleak shore of this rough life, Crying and lifting up its hands for aid, For without aid of human hands it dies, And usher'd in with tears: such is the germ, The living symbol and epitome Of our mortality and being frail. Unknown to all aroundâfor even she In knowing was as one that knew notâwhile She o'er Thee wept and smiled, and ponder'd o'er Things that she heard and saw, and musing gazed As one half-darken'd by the very light Of mystery enfolding her and Him. Yea, thrust aside as one of less regard Than one of common parents; set among The creatures of the manger and the stall. Yet I in this Thy littleness rejoice, The obscurity that mantled Thee around, Of men unknown, unnoted; for e'en thus It ever has been and it is with God, That He is hidden and we see Him not. 'Tis so in nature, so in providence, And much so e'en in grace; the little things That are around our path, meek infant ways, Are full of Godhead, full of mystery: For âwhat ye do unto the least of these Ye do to Me.â As cruel Herod then Did to meek babes what he would do to Christ, So we receive Him in His little ones; See Him in them, and them in Him. E'en now Behold the kingly host with which He comes, The infants new-baptized in their own blood On threshold of the morn; sweet new-born babes, As silver drops that on Thy cradle hung Of radiant shining dews, by the rude air Wafted to Heaven; while yet in shining beads They hung around, the rising sun hath turn'd Their glittering beams to red: they heard that voice Which from that manger spake the King of Heaven, âSuffer these little ones to come to Me;â And so they heard, and rose, and went away. O wondrous day of weakness and of power! Nature is dead and cold, and speaks of death; And where shall we beneath her winding-sheet Read aught that tells this mystery of God? Snowdrop, meek flower, that speakest at our feet, A voice as from the ground, thou hast withal Such language, that he hath no human heart That is not moved thereby; mute eloquence, Like this poor Babe and manger, so thou seem'st To hang as guilty though all virgin white, Bending thy head in meekness, and as fain To hide 'neath the green boughs which winter hath. But yet the friend of winter, and as one O'ercoming with its silent pensiveness The raging elements that range abroad: A silent comforter when storms are loud, It lifts its head and droops, and hides a tear. Yet who could understand thee, speaking flower, Ere Christ was born? Plato might vainly strive To know this language, this thy character Of meek and patient sorrow, pure of stain, And yet as one that mourn'd. Take it away From its own parent nook, and place among A rich array of flowers in wintry vase To deck some fair saloon, and 'neath the rest It still will seem to droop and hang its head, As one amid their fellowship that mourn'd. Nor only flowers without, but nearer yet;â In white untainted of Baptismal snows, On which there lies the purple beam of morn, In our own homes shall we this lesson read Of Christmas, of meek beauty that endears, And in its very weakness hath its strength. For Christmas-tide with its mysterious Babe Hath set its language, fragrance as of Heaven, Upon all children that are born of God, Children of Grace. Nay, from this hallow'd Birth Nature herself upon her little ones Attractive powers and beauty hath diffused. For doubtless mindful of that Babe Divine Hath God to infants given such touching grace, Such winning ways, the sight of which alone Seems to breathe innocence in this bad world, And to suspend the thoughts which sway and rule Our tempers and our hearts, till men have made The robe of Baptism like a winding-sheet, To cover the uncleanness of the dead. Sweet innocent, wet with the dews of morn, Bright with its rays, thy tender dimpling smile Hath to me something of unearthly charm, Nor less too have thy tears; nor hath this world Such strength as is in thy sweet helplessness; For it hangs passive on the Almighty's arm, And therefore is more powerful than the world. And fierce vindictive passions in the height Of their tempestuous rage have been allay'd At sight of tender infancy, and men Grown old in sin have, gazing on thy cheek In momentary sadness, felt the peace That is with thee. O tender little one, Like a blue harebell in the desert found Beneath a rock, and gathering all the dew, Its chalice bowing on the slender stem, And hanging on it Heaven's own silver tears;â Not without hope, meek infant, that there is Wisdom with thee which I would lean to learn, And in the desert of my parchÃ¨d life Take home the peace thou teachest, all the lore Wherewith our Christmas day hath gifted thee: In thy dependence, in thine ignorance, In thy felt helplessness, and care of God, There is Almighty wisdom, more avail Than in all seeming powers of mind and strength; For God Himself hath beenâis in a child. Hence too this wintry season of His Birth On this world sheds its gentle influence, And on its people, on their stony hearts And features casts a ray of kindliness, Melts awhile iron tempers, putting forth Conciliatory hands, and opes the heart To gleams of charity; though such again Runs forth in worldly mirth, fevers the pulse, And drowns the better thoughts it would infuse In revel, kindling fire of after pains, And laughter to be cause of after tears. Nor only here on earth our little ones Have from this day of Christ the endearing strength, But they are loved of angels, who behold The face of God in Heaven, for His dear sake Who hath been as a child,â'mid children one, But never one 'mid angels. On them thus He shines from this the cradle of the morn, And they give back the rays He on them sheds; For mouths of babes and sucklings speak His praise. Mysterious Childhood, how it has within The opening mind that which should ever be The goal of all our being, and the crown Of perfectness at which our life should aim; Its lofty aspirations full of Heaven, And yet contented with the present hour. Something it hath from a diviner fount Of light we know not of, which thence wells forth On after-life, which then is nearest Heaven, When most resembling childhood; as the dawn On Eastern seas, half mingling with the dark, Shoots forth a freshening beam unto the West, So doth our childhood, with its light from God, Anticipate the wisdom of the grave; Seeming withdrawn awhile, and left behind At threshold of our course, it hath o'erta'en Our manhood and its boasted intellect, Wise in the cares and schemes that bind to earth. Moreover this the Cradle in the stall, Which points to, which portends, precedes the Cross, How it becomes to us the key which opes This our mysterious childhood, and the powers Of Heaven-protected helplessness! The child, All smiles and tears when waking to this world, What is it but the sign and tender type Of love and sorrow? These two are the cords With which it binds itself unto all hearts In wondrous sympathies ere speech begins; Magic persuasiveness, to which responds The heart of fallen nature; it is these, Sorrow and love, like rays and dews from Heaven, Make up the cup of parent-tenderness, And fill the mother's being; and again, When childhood melts in youth, their joys and pains Are but another page in this our life Of love and sorrow: these the tendrils oft Which hang and creep on earth and bend to earth, But should put forth their arms and raise us up, And lift us to the Cross in the Eye of Heaven. My little one, e'en now in thy sweet ways Thou art all hedged about and compass'd round With love and sorrow; these twin sisters, these Are thine attendants day by day, and nurse With smiles and tears; these daily on thee wait, Sorrow and love, these are of Christ, and these Tended His infancy, grew on His life, Spake in His actions; all His awful words, And all His countenance in doing good, Were love and sorrow. These upon thee wait, These eloquently plead, meek babe, for thee. Oh! may they never leave thee, never part In their attendance on thee, but still wait Upon thy growing years, and school betime Thy childhood in all wisdomâne'er be found Asunderâfor the sorrow of the world Is without love; and all their love, which fain Would flee from sorrow, ends in bitterness: Sorrow and love Divine, these ever dwell With innocence and ignorance of ill. Sweet helpless infant, can it ever be That the Almighty God was such as thou? And if it be so, what is all our strength, Our wisdom, and our learning, and our pride, If the Almighty God is such as dwells With thee? Thou art within the world, dear babe, But sleepest and awakest ignorant Of all its storms; the winds may howl around, But thou, sweet nursling, carest not; the storm And snow may gather round thee, but impede None of thy smiles, nor dim thy pleasant eye. The storms that sway man's passion, storms of state, Or in the circle of domestic life, The achings of the heartâremember'd sinâ Losses of gain or honourâfuture harmsâ What are these all to thee? Yet thou art still The very picture of all helplessness, And left aloneâleft for awhileâmust die; Yet mightier in this thy feebleness Than all the arts and arms of this bad world. The infant and the dragon that pursues And ready to devourâthisâthis must be The symbol of our strength unto the end. The leopard and the lion and the wolf The âlittle child shall lead;â the children sing Hosannahs in His temple; children are The followers of the Lamb where'er He goes. And greater than in kingly might array'd, With chariots, horse, and his âten thousand slain,â Was David at what time he said with God, âMy soul is even as a weanÃ¨d child.â Then sanctified be this sweet hallow'd time, That brings the sun and summer of our hopes In the mid-winter, and on the decline And winter of our age scatters fair flowers Of all the spring, the modest flowers that breathe Of infancy and hope, and of our God Coming a little Child to dwell with us; For thou art very summer to the soul, Thawing the thick-ribb'd ice around the heart, Lighting the eye with sunshine. O new morn Of being, with what tender hands art thou Lifting us up and making all things new! May this the Christmas of the wintry year Throughout the annual circuit of the sun Dwell in my heart, and make it all to be A Christmas-tide of hope; in these employs That now engage my feebler time and powers, Companionship of childhood, day by day And morn by morn awakening up to teach, And be in teaching taught. With children thus Clothe me with childhood's thoughts, and with the glow Of innocence untarnish'd by the world, Fill'd with realities of things to be, With freshness drinking in things that have been,â Of Abraham that walk'd above the world While in the world, who ever walk'd with God,â Of Joseph and his brethren,âof the child Ta'en from the bulrush-cradle on the Nile To Pharaoh's palace,âof the shepherd son Of Jesse, loved and chosen,âand in all Of Christâstill ever present, ever hidâ Most present when most hidden oftâto men Who walk in sorrow,âHim to trace in veil Of other times and histories, as meet For childhood of the nations, and not less meet For childhood of our years. Alas! the world Would render e'en the Scripture's hallow'd page Cold as a thrice-told tale, while Childhood still Reads with new eyes, divine interpreter. In these our early readings ere the dawn Twice hath one little boy, when came his task To carry on the intermediate verse, Pausedâthen essay'd and paused again, his heart Too full for utterance. I was as one That noted notâhe hid his face and wept, And wept again, as if still unobserved, Nor could his task resume, for tears had choked His struggling voice. I spake not, but I thought Of tears which angels weep; for at each time It was Gethsemane of which we read, And Him who there was suffering for our sakes. And then, methought, this loving tenderness Seem'd a deep well within him where may sleep The image of his Saviour 'neath the soul, Laid up with best affections of the heart, Ere they are wither'd by the unfeeling world, With all that is exalting, gentle, pure. 'Tis thus that Childhood hath o'ertaken Age; For that meek child hath been to me like one Ta'en in His Saviour's arms, held by His side, And in the midst of His disciples placed, And who return'd that love which he received, Which it is life to know. And thus for me He that hath shut me from the outer worldâ From cottages and homes of His poor flockâ To house with painful sickness day by dayâ To grow familiar with the face of deathâ Hath haply thus design'd that I should thence With these His own meek little ones around Stand watchingâfrom His face to gain that love, That I may know His mind; for if it be Such awful doom, as that of worthless brutes Cast stone-bound to the waters, if so dread One to offend of these, then it must be Angel-like to protectâto leadâto guideâ Careful lest evil in ourselves the while Take up the will and guidanceâto infuse The taint unconscious of our own past life. Yet e'en this fear to watchfulness and prayer May urge the rather, and from the sick soul The fount of evil cleanse; in this our grief, As children clinging to their mother's breast, And hiding there the face suffused with tears, So may we to the Church as little ones In love and sorrow hide. The nameless charms And sweet endearing grace which God hath shed Upon His helpless ones to win our love, And court the loving tendance which they need, How melt they fast away with growing years! The waysâthe looksâthe forms of childhood sweet, How would we yet retain them still the same? But they in a few weeks are changed and goneâ Fast as on threshold of the opening Day, Beneath the feet of the advancing Morn, Upon the Eastern heights the roses fadeâ Fast change, and die in other hues; e'en thus The lovely forms of childhood change and pass So quickly, yet unnoticed in their change. We long to catch and note them as they fly, But they are not; so lovely every stageâ Of speech, of gesture, of first opening thought, Yet fleeting,âand the babe of yesterday, With all its charms, another is to-day. Emblems how all in life that we would prize Of cherish'd form or intellectual grace, Or feeling and affection, pass away, Like hues and petals of the flower that fade, Yet fading leave behind the chalice form'd, And seeds of after life: so all these scenes And stages, though so fair while they remain, Yet are not of our own and proper selves, But mould and form us for eternity. But hark! the week is gone, now the eighth day Is heralded from tower and spireâthe day That marks the Infant Victim for the Cross. But this day louder is the world's own voice Than that of sacred Church, with iron tongue Tolling the knell of our departed yearsâ Of all things that are gone or going by. Alas! how many times we needs must die Before we hence depart! 'tis nature's law; But Grace would go before and sanctify This law of nature, take it for her own; And Circumcision with its early day Comes in among the cries of infancy, Ere tears from fountains of the soul within Have learn'd the accustom'd channel down the cheek, And antedates the wrong. The Second Man Thus takes the sorrows which the first man sow'd, Known by the wreath of thorns around His brow, The Man of Sorrows ere the Prince of Peace. Mysterious wisdom, pearl of costly price, As in a beauteous casket here enshrined, The Circumcision and the saving Name; The eighth day and the first; the first again Returning in the eighth; the eighth which speaks Of resurrection and a second birth,â Life hid in Christ, in Him to be reveal'd. And unto us who number yet below The gates of time which mark our pilgrimage, The Circumcision and the New Year's day Together blend to form a wintry wreath, The ever-green enwreath'd with flowers that die; For New Year's day doth speak of short-lived flowers, Of earthly hopes and treasures going by; But Name of Jesus of the wintry green Which hath the semblance of undying life; The Name at which created things shall bow,â The kingly Name upon the Cross inscribed,â The Name which in true Canaan gives to rest,â The Name of the Unknown,âthat blessed Name, The key of the abyss, the door of Heaven, The treasure-house of Mercy, which the trump Of Pentecost return'd in thanks to Heaven, âThine Holy Child,â against whom all conspire, âJesus, Thine Holy Child, the Name at which Wonders and signs go forth.â The Name of God In goings forth as Man, when He shall lead The army of His Saints all clothed in white; The Name of life in circumcision found; The circumcision of the heart and tongue, In spirit and in life, in ears and eyes, Without which every soul that seems to live Shall be cut off from Israel of our God. The Victim's blood hath mark'd the Innocent, Like purple beams upon the unsullied snow Just come from Heaven, and thither to return. âMade sin for usâ that we in Him might find The Saviour, and put off all sinful lusts, Put on Himself, Himself our righteousness. What shall bear witness to the mystery That we ourselves in Christ are circumcised, Though by no earthly hands? and what is this, The spirit's circumcision? 'tis to yield Houses and lands and children, wife and friends, That we in loving Christ may have the same, Both friends, and wife and children, house and lands, In Christ, so having not we have the more. But why with such unalterable bands, E'en superseding the Sabbatic rest, Hath the Law bound it to one dayâthe Eighth? But that the bridle on our passions set Avails not, save in Him, the rising Morn, The Sun of Righteousness in whom we live, Risen from the grave as buried there with Him. O blessed law of loveâlove that makes light All labours, and the painful turns to joy! âFor circumcision it availeth notâ In the old Adam, though it mark the soul, âBut the new creature.â Thus in Thee is given Life to dead rites; the life which learns in Thee, Hard lesson else, to sacrifice the will, And bind it to the altar of Thy love By fetters of obedience. Thus art Thou Rising up early, seen as one in haste, In spirit of true Sonship, to perform No given commandment, but the Father's will,â Loving obedience; that from henceforth such In spirit of adoption may be ours, Hallow'd in Name of Jesus;âe'en for love Choosing the sterner part; though innocent, The guilt-denoting rite to take and bear, In sympathies that yearn'd o'er sinful man. Rising up early in the morn to go Unto the Mount of Sacrifice, ere dawn Is Abraham on his way. Now the red streaks Are with the rising sun, and usher in The sad, sad day of woe, to set in tears; Ere the full red which marks His going down Shall note hereafter Resurrection's morn, And that great glorious morrow God shall bring. Thou art in love with our mortality, And hastenest to Thy Cross before the time; Not only in Thy Manhood all Thy Blood, But in Thy Childhood, wouldst Thou shed for us, To hallow Childhood's sufferings, and invest With soothing sense of Thy self-sacrifice The pains of infancy, and early show The Lamb of God. Oft as we tend and gaze On childhood's throes, opening the heart to bleed, Pondering on innocence, and Adam's sin Born with us, and its sorrow,âthis Thy woe In tender love sustain'd, this infant rite, Speaks to us more than all philosophy Laid up in storied tomes or accents sweet Of lore divine that charm the sense of pain. For e'en from early childhood unrestrain'd To add to things that minister to all The Adam seeks within us, and the Eve Listens, and then admires, with curious ears And wondering eyes, then takes and eats of death. But circumcision and new life in Christ, On the eighth day arising from the dead, Shall guard the Tree of Knowledge by the paths Of boyhood, when the serpent lies in wait, Tempting to thoughts forbidden, goodly fruits Where hidden death, once tasted, once for all, Passes o'er the whole life. Of discipline So needful is the rod, and healthful pain, Engraving on men's souls the sacred seal. For in our childhood opening to God's love Faith in the Blood of Christ is as the rose Tender and beautiful in the meek bud, Wet with the morning dews, the genial life It drinks from Heaven upon the earthly stem; And Circumcision with its type of pain The palisade of thorns that girds around, Marking true faith from its weak counterfeit. Beside our garden walks these wintry days There is what seems to be a purple rose In all its lineaments, and fair to see, Yet 'tis scarce more than semblance of a rose, Hath not the fragrant power and nameless grace, And is without the thorn. Thus all in life That blooms and hath no thorn, hath not the power Of soul-subduing good; nor is the Name Of Jesus save in circumcision found. But we, so tender of our little ones, Shrink from the cold of the Baptismal bath And the trine burial in the wave, and thus Choose through all life the softer privilege, Would walk on tapestry, self-sparing side, Gentler indulgence, and relaxing rule. Thence aspirations of eternal youth In things of God grow weak; the colder Churchâ The fastâthe matinâgodly discipline, And knees by prayer indurated,âall these Are from the Name of Jesus set apart, As things that His religion needeth not. How save in circumcision shall be found The Name of Jesus? Where shall they be found, Those jewels that make up the crown of life, The eight Beatitudes, except in this The covenant of suffering? where the joy But in the persecution? where the meek, The poor in spirit? where the soul that mourns, And mourning finds the Comforter? All these Are but the Name in circumcision found. Alas! how much must little children bear, Untold, unheard of, sharp or angry words That leave a wound, ill-timed severities Of parent or of guardian, whisper'd not E'en to their dewy pillow, save it be In sighing dreams: and then with elder years The school-mateâsome small tyrant, it may beâ The gibeâthe laughâthe nameâwhich sink with pain Into the tender flesh! Yet of all these I murmur notâit is our heritage Of thorns and sorrowsâthick set round our door. Rather I read in them of our sad need Of sorrow e'en in childhood: though it come Wrapt oft in guise of seeming accident And trivial circumstance, it is the cross Doubtless in scale of Everlasting Love Weigh'd out for each, proportion'd to his strength, And sent by loving Angels, such as watch Around their childish ways with ceaseless care. And He His head bends low, and listens then To hear our childhood's sighs, who heard of old The cry of faithful Joseph in the pit, And prayers in Egypt's prison. Thence may date The seeds of all the good of after years. Nor less so in the loving discipline, Parental or scholastic, such as tends On boyhood, discipline of God ordain'd. All these that holy rite hath sanctified With its deep mysteryâthe mark of Christ Deeper to be indented with our years, And from the flesh descend into the soul. Thus Israel from its dawning infancy, Train'd by the Schoolmaster that brings to Christ, Bore that strange badge of suffering, else not given To eat the Passover; faith's secret sign That rooted in the ground which bears the curse They who would upward rise and spread to Heaven, Built by the attractive powers of sun and shower, Yet need the pruning-knife. We lop below The branches of the tree that rises o'er Our dwellings, that in height and nearer Heaven It may bring forth and multiply its flowers, Mantling them o'er with summer shower of snow, Or bear its clusters 'neath the autumnal eaves. The spirit needs not superfluities Wherewith ambition clothes the outer man; These must be held as nought, if e'er the soul Would reach the perfect stature found in Christ. Now immortality is at the door And the morn breaks, but 'tis midst clouds that swell With weight of human sorrows, and look black With waters of affliction; till the sun That gathers them around him at his rise Hath gilded o'er, and like a glorious dawn Hath made to be a door of Paradise, Through which we enter; but in entering chill'd, Wet through the clothing which would keep us warm, Wet with the dews of sorrow to the skin, Are taught to suffer with a suffering Lord. This circumcision was in Moses seen When he was given unto the dangerous wave, All earthly objects cast aside and lost, When taken up to God, and given to rear Unto his natural mother, yet from thence In Pharaoh's palace as a stranger dwelt. This is the dying lion, in whose death Is found the sweetness of undying life; The covenant of suffering which no age, No state is free from; such was Isaac's sign, As dying while he lived, the sacred seal That set apart the victim doom'd to bleed For sacrifice; long on the secret flesh This Israel bore, but bearing knew it not, Or would not have denied upon the Cross The Giver of all life who came to die; The Lamb slain ere the world's foundations were, The Lamb that died in Abel, died again In Isaac, was with Jacob on the stone His pillow, and with Joseph torn and sold And buried, o'er his son with David mourn'd, Was with Isaiah sawn in twain, and wept With Jeremiah, in Ezekiel scorn'd, With Daniel praying in the lion's den, And with the Princes three He walk'd the fires. Thus in the weakness of the flesh that shrinks Shall Israel wrestle with his God; and still The more he fails within himself, the more Shall he with God prevail. Thus at all time, When fires of persecution shall descend Into the branches of the Church on earth, His Presence shall be seen, His voice be heard Speaking therein, as when it wasted not In the Egyptian furnace, but the more Full of deliverance unconsuming burn'd. This is the Angel's sword at Eden gate Which keeps the Tree of Life; by this the Saints Press onward, while the world with wonder sees The secrets of that garden, compass'd round With sorrows from without, and griefs that lead Unto the Comforter who from all eyes Wipeth all tears. He promised and He gives; We have no sign but that of Jonas dead And rising, thence renew'd for life divine; Sign multiplied around us day by day In all the sons of God; the sign from Heaven, Which Jews behold and yet believe it not. But lo, by the Red Sea and desert strand, Her new-found joy with fears and sadness mix'd, The Mother and the Burden of the world! Behold, He comes! lift up the gates of death! Since Sorrow is the portion of the Saints, The handmaid of all virtue, such must be The pledge of Resurrection. Therefore this Thou bearest to the region of the Dead, Fresh from the penal rite, from Herod's sword; Within Thee and without the Victim mark'd For suffering, and for dying set apart. Egypt, arise, and shake thee from the dust, See, to thee comes the Conqueror of death! O strange mysterious land, so fertile found As like another Eden, yet the while With passing generations and with kings Together knit in one confederate bond In making their own graves! as if but born All thy life long to build and form thy tomb, And then to enter it, and clothe thee round With universal death. O wondrous clime, So emulous of stately pyramids, Palaces of the dead, whose living aim And sole ambition was thy death to die In ampler monuments, and be array'd More richly in thy dying! Teeming land Of sepulchres and coffins, as of one That knew nought but the mystery of death, Nor cared to know; and yet with all thy fanes As one that vanquishing was vanquish'd more, And shrining this unwillingness to die, Died but the more; erecting on all sides Trophies of death. O region of the Dead, The mighty Dead, like busy ants at work To lay up wintry store, or as the worms That weave themselves a costly sepulchre With silken threads and insect tapestries Enshrining angel wings! Thus Nature felt Lost in a mighty void, and in the dark Grasp'd at some hidden life it knew not of, Stretching its hands in vain, as if in scenes Of life's most fertile fields it had not life, And sought it thus in death. Behold the Child! The Circumcised! He brings the saving Name, The wisdom which ye know not, yet would seek,â The wisdom of a life which daily dies, That it may find that Name which ever lives, That Name which like the sun upon the cloud Hallows the Sacrifice, and o'er it forms A crown of promise and the Conqueror's bow; That Conqueror He hath âupon His thigh, And on His vest of Blood a written Name;â That Conqueror whose goings forth have been From Everlasting. 'Tis the Lamb that comes, That âconquering and to conquerâ comes to die, With His own army dyed in their own blood, Innocent babes that on His goings wait. Egypt, in thy great darkness light hath dawn'd: Full soon thy solemn cells, mysterious still, Shall peopled be with saintly anchorites, That sought for death in life, that they might find Their life in death,âmight find that saving Name Which is the true embalming of the dead, The Jesus in the circumcision found. Around His holy Head are glorious beams, For now the dread Epiphany begins The circuit of all timeâweek after week, The circle still increasing, eddying on For everâtill it compasses the world, And ushers in the Everlasting Light! Lent. Lo! from my window, as I stop to gaze, Between the embowering shrubs, lands far away, With all their habitations bright and clear, Come out beyond the Severn, on the sight Brought in unwonted nearness; close at hand A broken rainbow speaks a falling shower, Else all unseen; it is the sky above, Tearful and dark, and overhung with clouds, Which makes the distant scenes to shine in light. And thus the approaching time of penitence, And sorrow, lightens up the realms afar, Beyond the Western river of our death Which flows between. And I remember'd then That it was written, for the pure in heart, âThine eyes shall in His beauty see the King, And shall behold the land that is far off.â Beautiful sights, that still break forth anon Around our earthly dwellings and our paths: Some grace or strange majestic power of Heaven Blending with earth, that o'ertakes unawares Our dull, low, creeping thoughts, or on our course Arrests with glorious vision! Yesternight, On a dim clouded eve, above the hill And the dark trees a sudden blaze of light Reveal'd the moon with more than usual round, Lustrous and full and white, o'er the blue heavens Shedding pale gleams 'mid mountain-rolling clouds; Such lift the heart from earth: 'tis not the sight Of glory or of beauty, nor diffused The sense of the Unseen upon the soul, Serene with the sublime, soft with severe, But that they are our Father's, Him they speak And are His loving harbingers abroad, Walking in silent brightness; it is this That round their goings sheds the unearthly charm; 'Tis this that makes them sweet, makes them divine And lovely in their beauty and their power; 'Tis that they speak of God, that they are His, And He is ours. O glorious tearful Love, That fills the o'erburthen'd soul, and o'er it flows With awful tenderness; this is the light That should invest all that is fair and great In nature, in themselves but little worth, Till seen in all their varied characters To speak the eternal Beauty which is ours By Mercy pardoning sin, which leaves below Some vestige of His glory, some remains Of Paradise, and love not all withdrawn. Such sights majestic on His goings wait In the Apocalypse, and raise our souls From nature unto grace. Then Love that wakes Turns into sadness, to a sense of sin, To prayer and watching, to abasement low,â To dwell where Love and Sorrow have their home, Which is the Cross of Christ. Thus on Him wait Whate'er is fair in this our outer world, Kindling our love to Him that made them all, And through our love may bring us still anew Unto His Cross of goodness and of power: Infinite power and goodness infinite. Thence all things read anew; all things shall speak This language of the heart, which there hath made Its home, its dwelling-place. For oh! how changed, With what new eloquence did landscape fair, Earth, seas and skies, and sun and moon in Heaven, With all their variations to the sight, Speak unto him of Tarsus, night or day, By sea or land arresting, as about From place to place he in the body bore The dying of the Lord, and knew the God Who spake in nature was his own loved Lord. And thus to penitents from age to age They speak a language to the world unknown With other tongues the Spirit gives to hear. Sweet as the gales that breathed of Paradise And vernal Resurrection o'er the hills,â The desert hills of Judah,âwhen their tops Bow'd, trembling with an awful stern delight, Touch'd by the feet of Mary, as she bore Her sacred burden to Eliza's door. And what if sights like these to them that mourn May something of His glory thus disclose, As 'mid deaths oft and daily dying, Paul Heard those mysterious words in Paradise. Or as when Christ of suffering spake apart, Walking in sadness with the sorrowing Twelve, And deep, and yet more deep, the Cross foretold, Which He Himself and all His own should bear, He took up to the Mount the sorrowing three, And oh! more glorious than the sun or moon, With all the golden pageantries of Heaven, A glimpse of resurrection there disclosed. And now another spring, another year Bears on to longâlongâlong eternity, Numbering the watches of our fleeting age By callings to repentance. Spring returns, Spring into summer melts, and summer pours Its lap in autumn, which in winter dies, And winter gradual kindles into spring. Thus, now advancing and retiring now, The seasons intertwining form the wheels Which, turning and returning, bear us on To the great circle of eternity, Which in itself revolvesâend without end. Their changeful rounds set forth the Unchanging Whole, And all their changes to the Unchangeable Hasten, as rivers to a shoreless sea. The spring returns, and 'neath her mantle green Brings sacred Lent, the admonitory call Of One who cares for us withdrawn from sight: As if from midst the stars when night is still, And Heavens are in their courses swift and mute, Like sentinel who speaks of dangers near, He came to us and ask'd if All is well. As if on ward, with gentle-warning touch He came, in solemn whisper heard within, âArise, and pray!â or with reproving grief, âCould ye not watch with Me one little hour?â Once more thenâand once moreâfor thus each Lent Is but the seed-time of the Great Unseen. And oh, how short the time! For what is life Amid the abysses of the infinite, The everlasting into which we pass? A minute spot beneath the shadows huge Of the o'erwhelming future, hedged within, Where lies our short-hour'd life, like valleys green With sunny lakes and busy works of men On verdant slopes, all circumscribed beneath The ever-present sight of mountains high, Alps upon alps ascending, till from view They hide among the skies. Such be to us The little vineyard of our life below, Where we are call'd to labour; it may have Its varied sweet with toil, and gleams and showers, And shadows intermingling with the light. 'Tis vernal Lent again; look forth abroad Where elm-girt fields terrace the sidelong hill That lifts its back behind, whereon the sheep Range for scant pasture o'er the dark-green down; The plough is on the slopeâthe ploughman sings His matins with the larkâthe harrow's march Turns back, and then its harness'd task renews On the hard clogs, and gathers weedy roots, Backward and forward still renews the task: Another scatters wide the stable heaps. Thus nature may set forth the work of Grace And seed-time, and the work that on us lies: Hard thoughts to break and open to the sun And dews of God's good Spirit, on the head The ashes of repentance: such the task As may by self-abasement soil restore, Chill'd and impoverish'd by the unsparing world. Meanwhile in heavenly places may be heard The Intercessor's plea, Stop yet awhileâ Leave it aloneâbut one year moreâand spare; If it bear fruit then, well; but if not then, Then shalt thou cut it down; for where it falls, There the tree lies for ever. He that pleads In Heaven, on earth His warning voice applies, With warning joins His interceding Love. And now this gradual burst of genial Spring Looks in upon us, and with such a call That it must needs its gentle teaching blend, And harmonize its soothing eloquence E'en with the sterner wisdom heard within. Early before the dawn hath mark'd the sky I hear the little birds, in accents sweet Speaking of love and joy; and all the trees Are swelling preparation, 'neath each shrub Looks out some modest violet, verdant banks Stand thick with showers of yellow primrose pale As Winter's sky with stars; for Nature keeps Coming espousals of the earth and sky. Love issues forth abroad,âthe varied green O'er-canopies his ways, while the bright blue Soft intervenes; Flowers spring beneath his feet; Birds sing around him from their sylvan homes; Clouds at his presence move, careering fast, And open all the Heavens; the Air is balm; Earth, Sky, and Seas and Rivers, graceful smile; And all his path is sunshine as he goes. I deem it in accordance meet and kind The Church at such a season should repeat Her annual call to mourn. For what if Love Builds now his nest abroad with budding gems Embowering overhead. with flowers beneath, And keeps with songs the same. It seems to say We have another love, another home, The love of God and Heaven; and of that love The Cross is made the sign to us on earth. Look up to Heaven, the busy Day hath dropp'd His curtain o'er the many-colour'd scene And many-voiced, the silent Night invites Our eyes, prone on the ground, to lift toward Heaven, And ponder there on our eternal home. See, how the dark hath shown more than the light, Light hath the earth, the dark hath oped the skies. On wing of swiftest motionâwhat repose! Like some harmonious musicâyet how still! Silence and light and swift obedience all: Obedience without law, light without shade. Day stirring-tongued hath ceasedâand Silence left To tell her tale more movingly to man, Of beauty such as is not of the spring, Of resurrection's great unchanging year, Pure and serene as night, when she lets fall Her tears for sinful man; of Love Divine, Not sought in vernal Nature's soft delights, But with the Cross of soul-subduing Lent. But is there not a peace self-reconciled Which knows constraint no more, and feels no yoke; For faith and virtue breathe celestial air Here upon earth, where all is joy serene;â Where the light Cross knows suffering Lent no more, For love is its reward, its own delight? Yes; unto them whose will made one with God Hath perfect freedom in His service found: When His commands become the wings that bear Upward to Heaven, and there find rest in Him. But faith and virtue know of no advance, No forward step progressive from the past, Save where self is denied, self overcome: As climbing vines in heights they have attain'd Hang full with summer fruits, and there repose; Yet rise not thence save where the tendril spreads Cross-like its hands, uprising shows the Cross. 'Tis thus on earth, where our probation blends With the infirmities of human will; For that must on it bear our Master's sign Which would increase His love; it is the Cross Gives wings to Prayer, for Heaven-conversing Prayer, When Fasting and when Sorrow hedges in, Is then most strong and sweetest; 'tis the Cross Which sanctifies all deeds of charity, E'en as the widow's miteâbent all to give, Like life-blood from the heartâthence dear to Him Who gave His all for us; whate'er it be Which we with God would treasure, if the Cross Be absent from it, 'tis not known in Heaven; For Alms without it cannot pass the door, Unless they bear on them that Kingdom's stamp, The type and superscription of the King. With open-handed boon, from door to door, 'Mid low-roof'd cottages to pass, as soft As wings of Western winds that breathe on flowers,â If the Cross be not with it, 'tis as nought With Him who sees in secret; and to pore O'er sacred volumesâsit by flowery wells Of ages rich in wisdom, converse sweet With saintly men of old, in studious cell, If the Cross marks it not, and keeps subdued By unremitting prayers and self-distrust, 'Tis but as worldly knowledge puffing up To leave the heart still cold. To walk abroad In cloister'd garden haunts, for student pale, And watch each flower and shrub, each gleam and shade, If the Cross be not on it, with the rein O'er wandering thoughts, e'en this too is but cause For retrospective sorrow; further yet, To teach the ignorant, subdue the proud, To move all hearts with pulpit eloquence, And kindle the Refiner's fire in souls Merged in the world, 'tis no avail in Heaven, Unless the Cross be on the heart in prayer, Sole sanctifier; nor can this my verse To me and others work enduring good, If not with that Anointing consecrate That goeth from the Cross and Him that bears That weight of loving sorrows. Therefore sweet I deem this season of the opening year, Because the Church hath on it laid the Cross, So to attune our hearts to bear a part In vernal signs unblamed, and hallow'd thus That sadness of the heart which oft attends On Nature's joysâthat strange unconscious grief, Which speaks of man exiled from Paradise; Nor all unmeet are suffering Nature's smiles With the Church call to inner shrines apart, Between the porch and altar there to weep, Although our Second Adam for our sakes Kept fast His forty days where Nature mourn'd, Amid the creatures of the desert wild. For what if sympathies now stir abroad, Making the airâthe waveâthe fieldâthe boughâ All animate and vocal with delight? As when the impassion'd heart expression seeks With flying fingers o'er some instrument, And wakes and modulates unto a tongue; So now all Nature moulds herself a voice Jubilant with thanksgiving, breaking forth In beauty and in life and vernal joy. Man's heart is made for a diviner love, Love which may walk above the things of sense, And hold communion with the eternal world, Treading on all that man holds dear on earth, And walking on the clouds with eyes that gaze Upward to throne of God, whereon there sits He that is God and Man; nor all in vain Are Nature's sympathies, for we with them Still blend our lower being, now made one With Him who sits in Heaven. For all are His, All to His service bound. All good He links E'en to His throne in Heaven, where now He reigns Above the highest star, with power to draw All things unto Himself. The man within Is made for love which above wisdom soars And contemplation, fills the being whole. What is the feeling heart, the kindling eye, The bloom of strong affections on the soul, With all the powers that move the heart of man, But gifts, and tendrils, and attractive chains, By which we might feel after, and might find, And hold the Man of Sorrows; Nature's stock Where spiritual love might grafted grow,âan eye That hath been made for tears, that it may weep On Calvary; feet that might thither tend, The soul of love within them moving there; Unbidden hands that there might hold Him fast, Him whom our love hath found, nor let Him go? Alas! that such e'en Nature's tenderness Should be the occasion and the hold of sin, Mating the soul with charnels and the grave. For He Himself is Love, His Name is Love, Love is His Being, Love essential God; And all things unto Him He draws with love From step to stepâfrom chain to chainâfrom low To highestâall He fills and moves with love Which He would to Himself conform, would make Like to Himself, unto Himself would join, Clothed with Himself and housed, made one with Him; Love in them, they in Love must dwell, that thus Self they may leave behind, and dwell in God. Yet more: our God Incarnate gives Himself Upon the Cross to be our Living Bread, The one true food of body and of soul, And so our very senses to Himself E'en in Himself hath sanctified, that they Into Himself thus more and more may grow; The hands, that they to Him all the day long Be lifted up in Prayer; the knees, that they By kneeling in their weakness by His strength Be strengthen'd; and the feet, that they may be His own and on His errands always found Of mercy, on the mountains bringing peace, Beautiful as the streaks that make the dawn;â The eyes, that they with His own light within May all things read, fill'd with the mind of Christ;â Read Him in Nature and in Providence, Read Him in daily life, on public stage, In all things read His parable; the tongue, That it may be all His, may speak His words, And prayer and praise and charity; the heart, That it may beat for Him who gave it life, The better life, the Blood of His own Heart, That it may be within the Well of Life. So where His hallow'd Cross hath gone before, His quickening Body may be stretch'd on ours, The living on the dead, to every limb Infusing life divine; 'tis not to us Mezentius-like, as told in heathen tale, Though such was once to Him a bed of death So exquisite in torture, when of man The body dead in sin was bound and spread Upon His Living Body on that Cross, But unto us 'tis life, His life o'ercomes And swallows up our death, with His own life To live for ever. To each sense, each limb Imparting of Himself, of rest in Him. Oh, may we be of those, while time is given, Who hide beneath that saving, sheltering wing, Outstretch'd to gather us with earnest call! Sweet e'en His words reproving, when address'd Unto that little flockâHis tender careâ To whom His Father had the kingdom given: âO ye of little faith, to be afraid Of angry winds and storms that shake the boat!â âO ye of little faith, because ye fear Having no bread!â Ne'er words of greater love, As of a nurse who would wipe every tear From off her infant's cheek, each fear suppress, And by ungentle rockings to and fro Upon her quiet bosom soothe to peace. Wilt Thou not come to me each passing morn, In some told miracle which with the Cross May sink into my spirit? with some tale Of healing mercy, or some parable By which unto myself Thy Spirit says, âThou art the man, that need of health is thine?â Wilt Thou not come to me in scenes of life And nature in the field, while to the heart The creatures of Thy hand may speak of Thee? Now March's bitter and unpitying wind Blows on the tender, meek, and trembling lamb, E'en as the cold winds of the unfeeling world Came on the Lamb of God, the innocent Lamb Upon the Cross naked and suffering laid To all the winds of Heavenânay, all the winds, But not of Heaven. O all ye pitying thoughts, And all ye spirits that relentings move, Come to my heart from these my eyes without, And give me eyes within that Holy Lamb To seeâtill they drop tears, tears which within, When all is parch'd by the dry eastern winds, From sore remembrances of what is past, May come like April sun-showers! I that Lamb Would take home to my heart, that it may be Laid in my bosomâdrink my cup and eat My bread with me, my oneâmy little one, And be to me a daughter, one to watch And ward defiling thoughts. O mystic Lamb, Type of endurance and meek innocence, Still ever thus be with me, in my heart, And in my deeds and gesture from henceforth, And ever at my side and on my tongue, Teaching all ways of lowly gentleness. How can I hide him from the unpitying winds Of contumely, scorn, and the world's hate, But in my heart of hearts? With gradual move From week to week approaching comes the Cloud Of Lent, replete with penitential tears; The Cloud wherein God is, that we may fear, And bow'd to earth may hear His awful voice; Entering with Moses and Elias there, And there to be with Christâthe forty daysâ Lifted above the world, with Christ to talk Of His departure hence on Calvary, Learning how âgood 'tis for us to be here,â And thence with Christ descending, walk with Him In penitential humbleness and care 'Mong men below, and nothing know 'mong men Except Christ Crucified; so learn we how Sorrow's mysterious sanctities, which here Tend all the unclothing of the soul, and point In various shapes our pathway to the grave, May bind us to the Cross of God's dear Son, Work in us death that we may live with God. To wear the threshold of a good man's doorâ And to pass by with silent courtesies Those that stand idle in the market-place, The personal talkâthe light-heard vanities That perish with the past, discourse of farm, Of funded stock and merchandise, and stage Of politics, and incident in camp or town, Of wars, unholy leagues, and cries to arms,â Shut against these the ear, if it may be, And still more close the heart;âto talk of Christ E'en by the way, and of His dying love, And of the great Hereafter. Those avoid That love the dress of fashion;âon thy robe And fringes of thy garment be inscribed The love of Christ and of His hallow'd Cross;â For outward garb bespeaks the heart within; Nor artful care, nor still less let there be The artful negligence, but artless love Of chaste simplicity. And flee the stir Of controversial heats and kindling eye Of partisanship, the contagious fret, Mingling of human passion with the flame Of upward fires divine; but seek the abode Of wisdom, and drink in the pregnant words Of one that prays. Nor seek his tongue alone, But seek the searching of a good man's eye, And it may be the healing; above all Seek the absolving keys, of comfort sweet, The Church's seal of pardon. Some, may be, Need upward training on some stabler stay, Some dresser of the vineyard,âon the ground Else haply lost without all fruit or power, Waste wandering; yet a danger e'en in this Of too much aid, too oft appliances Of the directing hand, lest Conscience lose Self-guiding judgment, needing exercise, Leaning on aid external to itself; So frail, so subtle, and so complex-form'd The soul of manâits motivesâand its thoughts,â Its past, its present; interwoven all With inward make and structure; from without Its manifold temptations, and within. Nor can the charge and weight of our own souls Be transferr'd to another; no one else Can sit within the soul upon the seat Which God has made for conscience, and there placed The self-condemning, self-absolving judge, The oracle of God which is within. The tempter on external aid will urge To cast the burden, when with sterner voice The monitor within gives warning note Of danger, well-advised; while self-deceit Would plead her cause, and seek the approving seal. And doubtless all the long-wrought tangled web Of circumstance, of doubt, perplexing thoughts Of right and wrong, with convolutions raised And manifold dependencies, self-known, Are given to exercise the reasoning soul, To strengthen and to purify the eye Of conscience, from the motives unperceived, Whose subtle film the vision may impair. 'Tis oft as with the eye itself diseased, Medical aid through all the frame diffused Must strengthen the whole body, by degrees To pour new health into and so correct The instrument of vision. Conscience oft Needs renovation through the man entire, And daily life restored. To meet the Eye, The awful Eye of God, nor seek disguise The sickly soul will shrink, and turn away To feeble human counterparts, like birds That love to dwell in twilight. Better seek The Eye that is life-giving though severe, And by obedience to His inner law And to His written Word to hang on Him, Till weariness to rest, fear turn to love. Such caution need the ministrations oft Of sacerdotal aid and guiding powers 'Mid saintlike ways, medicinal and good, Of penitents. Far oftener souls impair'd Will altogether cast aside the bonds, Minister to themselves the absolving keys, In partisanship or example frail Seeking the opiate of unreal peace. Meanwhile, if girded with its lamp to watch, Repentance of itself within itself Finds theme for too much sorrow, when 'tis bent To drive some treacherous inmate from the soul. Who hath not found, when he hath striven and pray'd Against some bosom sin, that it hath been Like rousing of a viper which will bite And leave a sting ere he resigns his place Where he has coil'd upon the breast, too long Left haply undisturb'd and nourish'd there? Yea, e'en at holiest season or in hour Of solemn grief will make his presence felt. The unclean spirit then most fiercely raged When Christ was near, on hearing of His voice, And bidden from his victim to depart. Then fear not, but wax strong in faith and prayer When trial seems most rife, and on thee turns; For safe are we in God, till sin leaves reft Of His protection; but relapse in sin Denotes His anger and His aid withdrawn;â Full ample cause for sadness and alarm; For His displeasure answers to our fear. But every conquest proves a strength Divine, And strength Divine speaks all-protecting love. Then what if Prayer and Fast throughout the day Keep watch, the Rock thus smitten flows with tears, And is its own refreshing; better thus Than when in dead of night the spirit wakes All dry and desolate amid the stir Of this world's hurried pastimes, feels the weight Of everlasting ages yet to beâ On everlasting everlasting piled For ever and for ever; wakes to feel That every day, like wave on wave that drifts The nearer to that shore, doth render us Less fit to meet it, adds unto the score Of empty pleasures or of vanities Less stern yet not less empty: at such time In the dread still of solitary night, When Thought lets down the plummet to the deep And finds no bottom, Esau's bitter cry Is scarce more bitter; and that cry was full Of penitential tearsâbut yet the wood Was not in waters of that bitterness; For tears need to be wash'd with other tears, And grief itself is cause for after grief, Till brought to Christ, till Love hath sanctified And His all-healing Cross hath touch'd the wave. To Paul 'mid bonds, imprisonments, deaths oft, Bearing about the dying of his Lord, And his own body with no fancied blows Bruising and beating under, there was given Deep pleasure in infirmities, with men Of men most miserable, yet the while The glow within of everlasting morn Kept its perpetual sunshine. In the dawn The morning star looks fairest of all stars, Emerging from the gloom, and while it stays Bright gleams have bathed the tears which night hath left. In both alike, the crowded Babylon And the lone rock of Patmos, sons of love Admitted were to converse high with God, When the flesh weaken'd had let go its hold And pressure on the soul, and the freed wing Upward arose, from earthly weight withdrawn. When all is still in the dark solemn night, Such thoughts may be our music, whispering peace; For if to Saints and Martyrs chains and stripes, Buffetings of the world, exile and shame, Borne for Thy sake and chosen for Thy love, Were to them gladness and exceeding joy; So others in the losses of the world, In lone imprisonment and claustral bars, Though not for Thy sake chosen, yet in Thee, By Thee, and with Thee borne,âthey those sad hours Have found more sweet than all the blessings heap'd On former high estate and prosperous course. Then what if Weakness as with prison bounds Closes around, and Sickness with stern hand Draws down unto the grave day after day? Pining Infirmity, with night-long pains That pave the way to death, may render eyes That look to Heaven familiar with the Face Of the Great Comforter, who pitying looks On those that mournâHis loved ones; nay, at times Pressure severe and the approach of death Opens the eyes to things that are so great, And dwarfs or disannuls the hopes and fears That held the heart in thrall, when hurrying hours May do the work of ages. Sweet such hopes That cheer life's close. As I have seen what time A murky haze had veil'd the sky and earth And dimm'd the distance from the hill, when lo! Between the clouds shot down a silver shower Upon the western Severn, and afar Ships were beheld within that shield of light On confines of the Day. In other climes They seem'd to walk, within a brighter world, Fairer than ours. Thus have I known of peace That came upon the last declining days Of one who for long years had struggled sore With a desponding sadness. What remains Each day when kept from sin to yield Thee praise, Each day give thanks for the release from pain, Each day for comforts of some timely friend, Each day for self-denial seized in love, Each day for merciful occasion given, This is enoughâto cut off lofty hopes And aspirations which must fade as dreams When we awake; for strong imaginings Will mould and colour as the heart inclines, And from their own creations then stretch forth To love or hate, and minister to sin. These when the clouds depart shall be disclosed In saints of God as golden steps of Heaven, Transmuted by an alchemy divine. Hence from this season, which is wisdom's school, The heart may learn to keep perpetual Lent, By which the daily cares and toils of life Are sanctified, relieved, and fruitful made In good; when of itself the will is train'd To love the Will of God, because it thus Hath learn'd the virtue of the Cross of Christ, And what to Him may bring, and drink from Him Who smites and is Himself the smitten Rock. 'Tis sweet to think our path-besetting ills And trials are from Thee that lovest us And knowest, and thereby unto Thyself Would draw us, waiting for our love. To us Reproof is but remedial, though to Thee Stripes whereby we are healed; fleshly pains Are wearisome and profitless until Hallow'd by the remembrance of the woes That made long furrows on Thy back, and marr'd Thy countenance with sorrow; venom'd words Inflame, till gazing on Thee, taught by Thee, Love shall extract the poison of those wounds. Or look we forth where news ephemeral lift The mirror of mankind, the chequer'd page Of politics and trade, of strife and crime, 'Tis too much cause for sadness. Reason there Distemper'd and discolour'd looks on man, Shorn the sweet locks of charity; as when The sun arising in some murky fen Draws up the sick foul vapours round his face, And through them looks bloated and turbulent: In love of Thee restored her purer light Mounts high, with genial ray she walks in Heaven, And scatters earth-born vapours from her path. What are our home affections without Thee? Oh, that on those around us Thou wouldst set The shield of Thy protection, that ourselves May harm them not, nor soil by any taint Of our example; and if rent in twain These ties, may yet our love be firm in Thee! And what is earthly friendship without Thee? Its best estate is as some glassy vase, Or porcelain of frail transparency, Lifted with care and held with tender hands. At one rude blowâthe first, alas! and lastâ Shiver'd upon the ground it broken lies, All tearful, tender reminiscences. Nor though cemented and uprear'd again Is it what once it was, and our poor tears Are weak disjointed fragments to restore; It is not, and it ne'er can be again. But Thou wouldst all our loveâthough one rude sin Hath dash'd it all in shivers on the groundâ Yet Thou wouldst it replace and form anew, Cemented with Thy Blood and wrought entire, That it may hold the fire which upwards burns. Alas, our earthly loved ones, and their love! For what if rear'd throughout with constant faith? The deepest arrow thence may reach the heart; And the remembrance of them and their praise From the warm heart that lingers on their love Is but a gleam that plays upon their grave. The loss of those most dearâof all our woes The saddestâyet our choicest days on earth, Our best affections are but building up This height from which we fallâthey but prepare And nurse this tree on which our sorrow grows, Fostering our after woeâas then to fall When heaviest. Therefore this a gift Divine I deem, and school of wisdom, sent by Him Who loveth us; 'tis He hath given to weave From fibres of the heart those tender cords That join us to each other day by day, Strengthening and growing till they serve as bonds To bind our best affections to the tomb And that which is beyond it; warnings stern, Yet tender! for our life here would be still Labour'd forgetfulness of coming death, Did He not thus with love and human tears Soften the heart that He may write thereon The image of eternity. In them That we may learn of deathâlearn how to live, May learn a daily dying; day by day And hour by hour we die, 'tis nature's law, And we are but survivors of ourselves Because our better part is hid in God. Who is this comes up from the wilderness, Leaning on her Beloved? It is the soul At peace with God, to whom all nature speaks, âWinter is past, the rain is o'er and gone, Flowers on the earth appear, the time is come For singing of the birds, the turtle's voice Is heard, and in our land the fig-tree green Puts forth her leaves, and fragrant is the vine!â Who is this comes up from the wilderness, Leaning on her Beloved? O thou, my soul, Lean thou, for thou in Him shalt leaning find His strength grow with thy weakness and thy trust. Easter. The lark that housed so low upon the ground Is now aloft upon the summer skies, Poising at rest on bosom of the air, Himself unseen, or scarcely seen below; Or from his fluttering wings pours forth on high The very spirit of all thankfulness, Ascending as he sings and singing soars: The summer day, held captive by his strains, Feels an unwonted peace it knows not whence. Meanwhile the higher as he sings to Heaven, Still higher and more high on his sweet wing, The deeper and more deep his image sinks In the clear bosom of the lake below. E'en so upon the wings of holy love Whoe'er ascends toward Heaven, still as he mounts His image by himself as seen below Further from Heaven recedes, in rising he In meekness must behold himself as one In lower deeps, and less and less, until He shall himself behold and know no more:â Lost in the cheerful light of the pure Heavens, Not seen by men, and who himself 'mong men Sees notâno more belowâbut Heavenward borne, He pours his thankful spirit all unseen. Most blessed twofold vision; more and more To see ourselves more low and small on earth, And nearer God to sing in His own light, To see our shame and sorrow, and His love! Yea, what is all, as we look down below, Wherein we build our palaces of hope? A poor, fictitious Heaven, as in the lake, The shadow of the sky, unreal show, And semblance of that joy which is above, Fulness of light and freedom infinite. Thus in the mighty mysteries of Heaven, The man is lost who in repentance strives To apprehend; as more and more he looks Upon the face of Christ, and he himself Is in the heavenly places, more of sin In self-abasement conscious, he himself Sees lower and still lower, less and less. O blessed he who hath put on the yoke, And meekly knows the rest which is in Christ,â Rest for the weary spirit, rest and ease! As one who doing all things is as one Who doeth nothing; one who bears all things, Yet bearing is as one who nothing bears; And who possessing all things, is below As one possessing nothing;âsuch sweet peace Whose calm is e'en like holier innocence, When that her heavy burden is released, As love in sweet communion with her Lord Hath bound the soul, that in His spotless flesh Yearns to incorporate and lose herself, And has a joy within, though sadness mix'd, Such as the world knows not, and cannot know. Like the sweet smile upon an infant's cheek, Which something hath of an unearthly peace, Because no sin nor sorrow lurks behind; Yea, though awhile one pure translucent tear Is yet upon its eyelids, ere that smile Hath chased it from its place, as morning rays The dew-drop, both together blend awhile, Till love's bright beam hath kiss'd the dew away. Such is the joy from Heaven the Spirit gives Within the bosom of the penitent, The child of God; he is within His arms, Nor seeks without His aid to walk alone, But lifted up, upheld, and led by Him Drinks new delight, the air of life, and smiles, Strengthen'd, supported, comforted, restored. To will alone that which is perfect good, And willing to obtain it, this is Life, This of the heart is perfect peace; and thus It is with him who wills what God doth will. And all things then are evil in so far As they are hindrances to this one end; And whatsoe'er doth too much please below Impedes us from that true and perfect will Which rests in God; its source, its means, its end; The fountain, and the stream, and the great sea To which it flows, is God; in Him alone It rises, it continues, terminates,â That disembodied from the things of sense The soul may serve her God, in faith that sees And love that apprehends what God doth love. Beautiful is the day now spread abroad, Clear is the blue expanse, the blue more deep For the white fleecy clouds, and sweet the sound Of running waters; be it mine to watch By rural landscape, or by the great sea, Or native mountains dear, which lift the soul By their majestic altitudes sublime To things of God, eternal, infinite. Now vernal new creation all hath changed, To beauty, youth, and light, the shadows given Of resurrection and unfading youth Which are beyond the grave;âtransition strange Beyond all marvel, did not every sense Bear witness to the change. To us who breathe This universal atmosphere of death, Where all are dead or dying, all things made Mementos of our dying in their change, Thou art our Resurrection, and our Life, By which in our unclothing we are clothed Day after day. This spring-time speaks abroad Thee Who wert dead, yet livest evermore; And Thou hast drawn us to Thee, and hast made Familiar with Thee in Thy walk below, That we may know Thee risen; made to know Thee in Thy life of sorrows, for on earth 'Tis sorrow binds with strongest sympathies Each to his fellow-men; in going out And coming in amongst us full of grace And healing;âThou hast taught us to converse With Thee in faith, and in the flesh to know Thy Godhead, and in Thee the Father's love. Then for those forty days Thou still on earth Didst sojourn, oft unseen and oft to sight Recurring, when disciples to their craft And Galilean boats from place to place Went as of erst, yet in their hearts the while Bore a strange consciousness that Thou wert near, Come from the grave, rejoicing in Thy love Unutterably, knowing not each turn, Each moment, when Thy Form should be disclosed; And then, when expectation thought to see The golden steps unto a golden throne, Earthlyâbut throne above all earthly thrones, They saw Thee gradual rise from earth, and borne Upwardsârejoicing saw Thee rise to Heaven, Ta'en from their sight to be in Spirit near. So would we now, in glad yet trembling awe, Walk in Thy love, Thy love makes our new year, All rising, all ascending, all in Thee. Then lead me forth by Thine own guiding Hand And Providence, where'er abroad I go From this my studious nook and wintry shade, In the broad face of day, be Thou my Guide And Teacher not the less; make sights and scenes To be all full of Thee; Thou art in all, And all are Thine; and blessed he who sees Nothing but Thee in all things, sees all things As Thine; for this is love, this truth, and peace. Divine companionship, to know Thee nigh, In awful interchange of silent love Or vocal, in sweet psalms to speak Thy praise, To speak to Thee and hear Thee speak therein! Blest intercourse, 'mid the cross accidents That day by day and hour by hour athwart Ruffle the silver feathers of the dove, Which, toss'd about, would seek the ark again, Where Noah stretches forth his sheltering hand. As friend with friend, in friendly sweet discourse, Or sympathetic silence yet more sweet Conversing, still to feel Thee near, and most 'Mid sufferings of mankind, as erst of old, When sorrow, death, or sickness were to men Heralds of Thine approach. So now unseen In hunger, thirst, exile, imprisonment, Sickness, and nakednessâin these Thou art; And what is done in these is done to Thee. While in each shape of suffering here below The Man of Sorrows is approached and found. Nor only walk'st Thou with us here below,â With cords of man Thou drawest us to Heaven, That there may be our treasure, there our heartâ From earthly to Divine, from fleshly forms To spirit, that our souls may so ascend And sit in Heavenly places, there at rest;â From strong affections loosed and purest joys, Parents and friends and children, pastoral ties, Which, though by Love Divine clothed for awhile, Yet had too much of earth; like earth-born clouds Which catch the sun, and are exceeding fair But come to nought. So, while we walk on earth, Thy Spirit may all-clothe us with Thyself And love of Thee; and prayer-taught faith, that holds Ceaseless communion with Thyself in Heaven, May take our dearest objects here on earth Into itself, and into Thee, that they May be thus ours no more, but only Thine; Yea, because Thine so doubly ours in Thee. So venture we abroad, and 'mid the sights Of nature and the world, look forth with eyes Of them who have within them as they gaze The purer songs of an unfading year, More sweet than those which fabling poets feign'd Of universal Pan, with pipe unseen, Making the woods and valleys to rejoice. And blessed he that hath such rest in Christ, The many sway him not, but still retired In his own secret spirit, as a shrine Or hermitage apart, he for their needs Can pray, and pity them, and, pitying, aid, And lead them toward that rest which he hath found. For love hath a magnetic power to draw Spirits of men, to draw them by itself, By arts and ways untold, unseen, unfelt, Into the object where itself hath rest. Nor shall the streams which, myriad-moving, throng The iron ways, and flock suburban haunts, The spirit discompose which seeks His peace, And hath its rest and centre fix'd in God. When âlifting up his eyes He sawâ the crowds, âHe had compassionâ at their several needs, And healed them, and taught, and fed with Bread; When He beheld men as the âharvest-field,â Or âscatter'd sheep,â He pitied them, and said, âPray ye the Harvest-Lord that He will send Labourers into His harvest;â when He saw Jerusalem âHe wept;â and so the soul That hath its rest in Him, when it beholds The gatherings thick of men, touch'd at the sight, With yearning sympathies and tender love It flees to Him in prayer Who giveth bread, And upon Israel's mountains feeds His sheepâ Who knoweth every want and every care, And every throb that beats in every heart. Who hath not known 'mid crowds of thronging men That weight upon the spiritâlike the press Of many waters, and akin to tears, Moving amid a wilderness of souls? Not only such as of the Persian King, When at Abydos spread he saw the host, Nations and number'd ranks in order ranged, Saw and rejoiced, and wept; but rather his Who to that Asian Monarch in reply Spake of their many sorrows. To behold So many souls, each with his several grief, So many their pursuits, their little spheres Of hope and sadness, that one's self is lost In infinite of spirits numberless Clothed as one's self in this poor petty life. There is no solitude that weighs like this Amid such multitudes to feel alone. Then in this weight of sadness 'tis the thought Of Him who knows each individual grief, The thought of that great love that makes each one The object of His care and tenderness, The lone, indwelling soul, the conscious self, Which naught but Omnipresence could insphere With its close-mantling, all-investing love, Which more each one shall prove within himself By soul-experience he substantial finds Beyond all elseâreality and strength, Like Everlasting Arms beneath outspread, The comfort of the Eternal Comforter, The nurse that âdandlesâ with maternal love âUpon her knees,â and dries the falling tear, Familiar made with unaccustomed peace. Then the heart in this multifarious crowd Can beat as free as when it by itself Unfetter'd breathes the mountain solitudes. And now to see the living swarms that float, And press the portals of mortality, Souls upon souls, thick as when harvest-time Pours o'er the fields its overflowing horn; Or from a rock we see the unnumber'd waves; Of vastness, and of love, and majesty They speak, as they fast hasten to the shore, And lift their little heads on the expanse Numberless, overwhelming, small yet great. 'Tis this infinitude that wraps us round And comprehendeth all things; it is this, This omnipresence clothed with power, that works In marvels of minutest watchfulness So far beyond our sight, yet more and more With multitudinous eyes all full of love, Which numbers all the hairs upon the head And counts each tear that falls; this is the Love Around us, as the air that holds us up, By which we live and breathe, surrounding all, An all-upholding Presence ever nigh As in the Heaven of Heavens, and which to know Is Heaven. Yet have we power to wander far From that which is most nearâand thus ourselves Compass about with all degrees of death, Unmindful. O dread liberty of will! To know Thee, and yet knowing to forget, Or not forgetting to denyâby sinâ By sorrow or unkindness! Here below Parcell'd and portion'd out is this bad earth, But common unto all are the blue Heavens, With cheering sight and influence benign, So free alike to all that Love Divine, Love dwells entire for all. As East from West So mercy stands between us and our sins; As circuit of the Heavens through endless space, E'en such is Loveâyet on one little Cross It hangs, comes near, and puts on lowliest guise, That thus the mourning sinner may draw near, And bathe his wounds, and hang his eyes thereon. 'Tis the Cross holds the eternal mystery, Pointing to depth, and height, and breadth, and length, Which brings love down to humblest, meanest lot, And makes it the inheritance of all, The treasure of the life that's hid in God. As feather'd multitudes that throng the wings Of seasons come or going, men have too The times of their migration; when they flock From huge metropolis, which all its mouths Opens, they fill the rural villages, Drinking the freshness of pure nature's green, And woo on cheeks, paled with the hot populous street, Her livelier blooms; they flock the teeming lines Of rapid interchanges, fill the ports And harbours, bent for regions of romance, Sacred or Classic, ancient clime or new, Which most may thus alleviate the dead Cold hand of custom, the continual weight Of voluntary prisons; others walk On pebbled shores or 'neath the o'er-hanging rocks, And gaze on the wide ocean; where on hearts Fever'd with the hot stir of dusty life, O'er-strung and spiritless, the moving vast, The solitude, the boundless-seeming spread, The ever-changing yet unchangeable Of Ocean's varying face, with their soft gales Expansive breathe unutterable calm. For 'tis the shadow of that better rest Upon the bosom of the Infinite, Peace of the Everlasting, and of Him In whom unnumber'd spirits live and move, As waves in the vast Ocean, which to man Is given to speak of God, and be around A semblance of His endless love and power. Be mine some quiet shore to range apart, Or watch 'tween rocks some clear pellucid pool, With sea-weed waving 'neath the glassy floor Of every hue and form, and stony coves, And shells, and shell-housed strange inhabitants, Adapted to their spheres in wondrous ways, All wild and beauteous, in their shelly life Rejoicing. I have gazed, and gazing more Have ponder'd, till the sentences of God Have come to mind which speak of God's own care, More wonderful, more great in littleness, Than in its very greatness; this small pool Where the returning tide hath left the wave With minute shores and bays and dwarf sea-life, And in its rocky basin hedged around Reflecting the immeasurable Heavens;â 'Tis as an emblem of the mighty Sea, Its small epitome; yet in itself A magazine of wonders, small indeed, Such as a child might fathom, yet withal With depths no man can enter who would trace The Presence there of Godhead. With a child I linger on its marge in childish play; And somehow to myself and unto him God speaks in these things, and we hear His voice And feel His peace Divine; yet 'tis a voice Which e'en the wisdom of the wise, with all Its new scholastic lore of many names, Classes, and kind, and kindred, fails to hear, If tracing Nature's ocean mysteries, In that pursuit absorb'd and keenly-eyed, E'en in the very wonders of His hand, The Maker of all wonders they forget. As if an artist which admitted was Into the presence-chamber of a King, Were by his art so made intent to note Trappings, and tissued robes that hung around That Royalty, till noting he forgets The Sovereign they envelope; yet not so He who for pardon sought his kingly hand, Or in thanksgiving for a pardon gain'd; To whom alone the signs of tenderness Extending all around Him were found dear, And dear, because they of that presence spoke. Unletter'd Ignorance may often sit Beside the door of Wisdom, and there hear Unearthly sounds of knowledge from within, More than where keenest intellect of man From speculation and experience mounts Unsanctified;âmay hear the voice of God, While earthly knowledge hears not, and is deaf, Nay, by itself made foolish, by its light Made blind; admiring gems which lustrous are In darkness, it forgets the Source of Light. Thus God âgives fruitful seasonsâ unto man That man may know his Maker; he meanwhile Weighs causes and effects, and so made wise In mysteries of Ceres, yet knows not Nature's own mystery that God is Love. And thus in Eastern deserts sore oppress'd, Buddist or Bramin, Hindoo, sage or swain, Needing but little, and than those his needs Having still less, yet oft in this is rich That works of his own hands he worships less, Than men in varied intercourse of trade Or cultured fields and homesteads, thick with stacks Of piled-up grain and arts of husbandry;â But sees the more the hand of Him that gives And worships, where the desert hath obtain'd The scanty blessing of the dewy Heaven, And clings for life around the inconstant well,â Gadames or Sahara's palmy shade. And surely this hath simple poverty, Like childhood, in itself that it dwells near The voice of God, and therein hath possess'd Treasure and wisdom, such as angels prize, Which to the poor in spirit Christ bequeathes The rich inheritance of Christian peace. And so methought in that great storm of late That shook our dwelling, nay, that seem'd to shake The very earth's foundations, through the night Prolong'd, and such as ne'er before was heard By dwellers of our village; at one time The whole horizon one continuous mass Of rolling thunder; and amidst the roll From North to South, from East to West loud peals Answer'd each other; one might think to hear Articulate voices of a greater world. And then they nearer came and seem'd to burst About us, with the crimson forkÃ¨d lights Most terror-striking, of the rainbow hues, Which clothed the lights with their varieties: Suddenlyâand again all suddenlyâ Like inmates of our housesâsights and sounds. The lowliest cottager and village dame Heard in that sound something of the Great Day, And doubtless in so hearing heard aright. Nay, one throughout the night upon her knees Stay'd watching, as she said, to hear each time The trumpet of the Archangel; now of this I doubt not 'tis the warning God designs. Oh! how sublime in that simplicity, Simplicity of wisdom from above! I saw a gentle infant as the sound Roll'd overhead, with finger lifted up, Stand listening; and methought that little hand, Pointing to Heaven in that meek attitude, Was Wisdom's very self, that listening heard, And hearing pointed to the voice of God. Thunder and Lightning unto children are The Almighty speaking,âthus they understand Language divine; but unto men full grown Cause and effect electric, sulphurous gas, The vapourâthe ignitionâand the sound Measured at intervals;âto little ones Unlearned they are tongues that speak to man As God in wisdom hath intended them. I doubt not that they hear as He would wish Who made the thunder; and though for awhile Troubled and in amazement, yet that still It is the Mighty Teacher understood, Who thus subdues the sober'd heart aright To listen to His voice, when it would speak Rest in Himself, yea 'mid, above the storm, And deeper, to their troubled hearts in calm Is heard His gracious Voice proclaiming âPeace:â While 'mid the dread commotions He draws nigh And whispers, âIt is I; be not afraid.â That time at midnight when around us burst Thickest Heaven's dread artilleries, was one On whose familiar face I daily look'd, Long since an household friend, who in the midst All suddenly in silence breathed his last. Beneath that sound, when loudest was the peal, A still small voice was heard, Come, come away; And in that light that bathed the cottage wall, One with that sound, his spirit left the flesh, Untenanted until the Judgment Day. Inward the malady; for he had been Of the loud thunder-peals which were around, And blazes of red light that fill'd the room Unheeding and unharm'd: and then, methought, How He who held the storm within His hand,â So that it play'd around the infant's cot, And housed within our dwellings as a guest, Without us and within our chambers came, Yet not one hair scathed on a living head, Nor leaf upon the tree,âhow He meanwhile Was calmly beckoning with the other hand A spirit from the world; as if to show That not alone 'mid elements at war, He that at midnight comes, and as a thief, But that at all times the Great Day keeps watch, And overtakes men when they know it not. The suddenness of that departure hence Of one into the everlasting place Of disembodied spirits, is more full Of terror than the loudest thunder-clap. For suddenness is mark'd to us 'mong chief Of terrors which attend the Judge's path. Yet though to man death sudden seems, maybe 'Tis never so with God, but that He sends Pre-admonitions, which the waken'd soul Might notice; sudden deaths together rise Many at once; or some will go before At intervals, which place or time brings near, Or circumstance; or some prevenient sign Forewarning; need we add that life itself Is but one lengthen'd signal of the grave? That night is pass'd, and all again is still: And now the scene is changed, another face Of nature reigns, or on her features comes Other expression from the Unseen behind, Speaking to man in calm and quiet eve. The hill and giant elm-trees seem asleep; Their graceful shadows interspersed with light Cover the evening fields, 'mid the scant rays In chequer'd and calm bodies lie abroad, And represent to moralizing eye The gloom and gladness of mortality. Or silent interchangeably they move, As if in play to form life's strange chequer'd woof, A little while upon the verdant floor, When leaves are shaken by the passing gale. And now we feel we are indeed amid A world of shadows, floating all about, Which give place to each other, and all melt In one great shade, when gradual it lets falls The curtain, or the mantle fringed with gold. Some love the rising sun, within his beams To walk, to wash their steps in dewy morn, And as they walk gain wings, themselves, may be, Children of youth and morning; and 'tis sweet To those who count long hours of tedious night To watch the yellow light first skirt the hill, And then the varied colours one by one, As rosy-finger'd Morn, with saffron robe Advancing, lifts the portals of the day With all her rainbow hues, till in a while The evanescent tints have fled away, And one bright shining blue from East to West Opes the full eye of summer-shining Morn. Then thoughts too oft of praise and thankfulness Fast as those hues decay; Day spreads his wings, And sorrow on them flies. To me this lapse Of Evening brings a meditative hour Of more-enduring sadness, where from hence My solitary chamber to the West Looks forth, and doth habituate mine eye To the soft radiance and the mellow light Of Day, departing hence as if in blood. O Sun of Righteousness, then would I turn My anxious thoughts to Thee; O let my prayers As incense rise to Thee, and make Thy praise My evening sacrifice! The healing wings That were upon Thy goings hence, have clothed The clouds in crimson, and around Thee shed The tinge of restoration and the dye Of sacrificial peace 'tween earth and skies. The inly-musing eye thus reads portray'd, On the red portals of the Western Heaven, The awful calm of suffering Deity; As with the Twelve around Thee on that eve, That memorable eve, that festal night Of saddest valediction; never love So great, and never sorrow such as there. Those words of dying, yet undying love, Her Easter lesson, still the Church prolongs Upon our ears, and with Thy rising blends; When consolation bathed each word Divine, And all the glowing majesty of Heaven Was in that sorrow, sorrow lost in love, Till all was kindled in one burning light Of charity Divine, love strong as death, O'ercoming death, that walk'd in light serene. For in that dying there was more than life, And more than resurrection was then hid In solemn tenderness of parting woe. And we too, in beholding, there would bring Our sorrows, like the clouds which range themselves About the setting sun to drink his light, Our sorrows and our tears to blend with Thine; That they may catch the radiance of that love, And by beholding may themselves be changed, The less lost in the greater, until we May there our sorrows and ourselves forget. Thus we in all things see Thee speaking rest; Then when the dark comes o'er this troubled scene, May we go forth with Thee that awful night, Beneath the canopy of the blue skies;â When all above is silence, all is peace, Night fill'd with starry eyes end without end;â When witnesses of Heaven stand thick around, As if towards us the Heavens had nought but eyes, And interfered not with mortality. Like those Twelve Legions of the angelic host Which all about Thee stood, prepared to aid, And saying in their watches, âHere we be;â When all below was anguish, fear, dismay, The torchâthe staveâthe sword; yet nothing broke The unutterable calm that was in Heaven. Those orbs of light traverse their silvery paths Unerring in obedience, yet so swift Their order'd goings, that they seem to thread Some secret of majestic harmony Inaudible to ears that are of flesh, Yet to us are their courses seeming rest. So wouldst Thou teach us lifting up our hearts To be at rest in Theeâin Thee to find A better and a higher law, than all The fancied music of melodious spheres, Claiming of us obedience, that of love, An inner law, light, music to itself; Which in the bosom of the Eternal Mind Hath its own home and centre; thus to Thee Is join'd in Spirit, and in Spirit learns That inward light and peace, of which their rest Is but the faint and feeble counterpart. For here below 'tis all inquietude, The animal and rational alike Travails and groans in pain, from that time when On man's destruction bent the Evil One Enter'd the serpent, by it spake and moved. In witness thence to that mysterious truth The creature suffers too with suffering man; And man reads all around his own unrest, The mirror of himself; the only ease It is to hear that voice, the voice which speaks Of rest which is in Christ; for when His love Is in the heart all things are eloquent, And clothe themselves with language, to express The love which burns within; which throws its light Upon all nature, kindles other tongues, And listening hears their syllables around, Hears that one voice of love, and is at peace. The season now is pastâthe summer highâ Thus every face of nature have I found Where'er I go, to scenes that are abroad, Of multitudes that throng the iron ways, And stray beside the sea or rocky shore, Or here where thunder opes the midnight sky, Or shadows calm sleep in the summer eve, Or purple clouds flock round the parting sun, Or all the stars come forth on face of night,â In all alike my weary spirit hears The echo of a voice that is within, Whether from God's own Word or Spirit pure 'Tis kindled, yet it speaks, and while I hear I trembleâand am sadâand yet rejoice. And what is life in this my calm review? Nought but a scene of wanderings to and fro, And the forgetfulness of whence I came. A little child lost in a tangled wood, He hears his father call, and hastes awhile, Then stops and plays, and playing strays again Beyond his voice; then scared at sights and sounds He hurries on still further; but anon, Though he hath gone, his father yet pursues, And callsâand calls again; while shades fall thick Perplexing on his path, and sport with light Premonitory signs; and listening now When stillness is around he hears his voice, Though feeblerâfar awayâyet answering turns His footsteps. So I now would all things else Forget but that dear call. While still His voice I hear, and stedfast to the summons move, It shall become more audible, and now Haply be heard yet more articulate As I approach, and hear pronounced my name; And He within His arms may bear me thence Helplessâthat so I may not fear again Nor wander, but henceforth to Him resign'd Lie in His arms e'en as a weanÃ¨d child, Repose myself on Him to live or die, Yea, though He slay me; and from scaring sights Of terror, in His bosom hide my fears. Whitsuntide. The Rider, who went forth on the white horse Against Jerusalem, shall come again With armies on white horses clothed in white, And issue forth from Heaven against the world. When Pentecost at first through heart and tongue Lit up the beacon lights, the Spirit came Pleading for forty years with outstretch'd hands, To Israel, and the scatter'd tribes abroad, Ere on Jerusalem the Judgment came. Such was the type of things that were to be, Of things that now are and prepare the way Of the last final Coming: for the sun No sooner hath attain'd his height in Heaven, Than he is hastening to decline, the months That bring the summer haste to bear away; And so that morn whose feet were beautiful Upon the mountains, with its silver feet And saintly witnesses, hues tinged in blood, Hastes to descend from its meridian tower. âAll they that sat in council on him gazed, And saw as it had been an Angel's face;â But wherefore that irradiant bloom that crown'd The face of holy Stephen? not for nought That glorious lumination; the strange power Of beauty thus withheld in mute suspense Passionate hearts that burn'd with fierce revenge, And teeth that gnash'd, till they should hear awhile The Martyr's dying words, while they pour'd forth Divinest eloquence and witness bore; Thus were they with a charm'd entrancing gaze Held listening to the end, that they might hear. Haply it may be thus that in high place The Church hath made appeal to this our age, As with a face of beauty clothed without, In queenly robe of divers colours wrought, To hold unwilling hearts till they have heard. For thus Religion with her beckoning hand Hath come forth to the world in these our times, Not with the countenance by sorrow marr'd, Or fire and blood, but with the attendant Arts, Her handmaids, issuing forth from classic shades And Academic bowers, while Genius opes The way, and Learning rich with ancient stores. May be 'tis that which John in vision saw In the Apocalypse, when he beheld An Angel winging way in the mid Heaven, And all the earth illumined with his light Before the fall of Babylon; methinks, The kindling of the light, whate'er it be, Trial denotes approaching, like the flash And flickering of the candle ere it sinks In darkness; thus the vengeance came withal, Though good Josiah had restored the light To the Mount Sion; through Judea went The Gospel bearing witness, that all-arm'd And crownÃ¨d Rider on the snow-white steed, Before the shadows which on Salem lower'd Of that her last destruction. Sure the world Is hurrying on and speeding to her end With tenfold speed than hath been known before, And there are marvels now on every wind;â While with electric haste, like lightning pour'd From land to land, is all intelligence;â With influences viewless as the wind, In wondrous ways erewhile unknown, and such Surpassing thought, as amid them of old In wildest dreams scarce found a counterpart. What ânew thingâ now to-day? what tidings new Brings this new season? what unlook'd-for change? But yesterday in new-discover'd worlds God hath permitted the uncultured earth To open golden treasures, such as draw As by magnetic influence the hearts Of people, climes, and nations; wave o'er wave, As seas where some great barrier is removed, And tide o'er tide pour in the rushing floods Of souls, in the eternal balance weigh'd, Fill up the void, and make the desert lands All populous, preparing the round world For the great Consummation, which now hastes And hurries on apace with fervid wheels, Wheel within wheel, and louder fills the ear; As when one listens for some wheel'd approach, Now labouring in silence up the hills, Then hurrying on apace with downward course, Or borne straight onward; then at intervals Distinct and clear, then lost upon the ear, Then louder and at hand. The soul withdrawn In solitude and stillness of calm thoughts Thus hears the thundering motion of the speed That brings upon us the great Day of days, The harvest of the earth. Thus while men talk Of golden fields and homefelt loss or gains, Of money-markets, sinews of the world Braced or relax'd, and countless arteries That feed the heart of nations;âmore retired Behind the busy scene, the man of God Listens, should he perchance of God's own voice Distinguish the faint undersound, and waits On watch to see whate'er His Hand will do; Careful alone that 'mid the stir and noise He may not thus forget the âtreasure hid,â The pearl of costly price, which lies unseen In secret places, such as needs long nights And days of watching, and all waters tried In patience and endurance, cold and heat;â And that great City hid from mortal sight Whose streets are paved with gold, and portals burn With the effulgence of celestial gems. The Earth now lifts her golden doors, as if Long-hidden treasures opening by command; But what is gold? and what doth it portend? Now gold is to corruption close allied, And borders on decay. 'Tis peace awhile, Then wars arise and tempests shake the scene. The trees autumnal put on golden hues, And are one tranquil mass of hanging gold O'er the calm face of death. Then comes the gale Howling its prelude through the forest halls, And strips the golden scenery of death, Mocks at its peacefulness, shakes to and fro And lifts on high the besom. Wars go forth, Rumours of wars, and in a moment's space Tumults and arm'd dissensions rock the world. What is the mustering and the gathering arms, With sights and sounds that fill the Boreal heavens, The North all moving down its conquering hordes? When men said âAll is peace,â from hidden cause Mysterious, that the tongue in faltering asks The Why and Wherefore, and finds no reply; Our popular voice hath fann'd itself with hate, Blowing the fumes till they break forth in sparks, Kindled the sparks to flame, the flame to war, And Europe unto arms; then loud the sound Of justice and necessity, the boast Of powerâof armiesâof allies, and fleets, And of all-conquering Science. That which should Extinguish wars the well-spring of the strife, The Holy Places and the Sepulchre; But not as with crusaders leagued of old Is England now afloatâthe Saintly Isle Of CÅur de Lion hath made common cause With infidel and Moslem, Gaul and Turk, Preluding types of coming Antichrist. Meanwhile the womb of time, its destined course Fulfilling, throbs as with portentous throes, Ominous to disclose great destinies. And like those fabled giants which of old Heap'd mountains upon mountains in their war, And mingled earth with Heaven, so all things seem, Like heavings from beneath which shake the world, Gigantic in their shadows, and assume Proportions in their vast electric moves Commensurate with those great prodigies Which shall attend the coming in of God. And what if distant thunders for awhile, Which once awaken'd on their mountain bed, Now pause again and sleep? the very calm Seems ominous, and though the gale be still, The sudden risings of the unquiet leaves, Their hurrying to and fro, and whirlwind dust Arising, and the blackness which anon Runs with its ruffling shadows o'er the face Of the broad waters, these make calm itself Portentous and expectant of the storm. The sportings to and fro of the light leaves, Light as the air, aerial notions vain, Wild fantasies, and empty nothings void:â These oft may indicate the fearful sport Of unseen powers of evil, and combined With horrors which they cover for awhile With light soft-floating veils; such idols old Of worship, empty names; and popular cries Of revolutions wild, when tempests sway The multitudes; behind them in the shade Were devils, and the background full of Hell. As sportive doctrines light glanced o'er the Seine, When terrors black as midnight mirror'd were Within its depths, and palaces of blood. Meanwhile be not unmindful in these signs The love of money was the spot of heart That mark'd âthe man of sin,â when humble guise Conceal'd âperdition's son;â a golden cup Is in âthe mystery,â and fills the hand Of Babylon, the gold-clad sorceress; âThe glory and the kingdoms of the worldâ Were offer'd once in vain; but not in vain To the incarnate enemy of God. But who his followers? what battle-field? What nation, and what army, and what arms? I doubt notâno such hosts as range apart The Roman and Waldenses, armÃ¨d crowds In which on either side doth Satan pass Unseen from man to man, by secret hearts Numbering his host and unknown votaries. Away then with the idle Seers, which thus In climes and peoples, marshall'd rank by rank, Would see the secret things which are of God. Again: when exiled Jacob on the stone Slept houseless, he was visited of God, With angel hosts and ladders into Heaven, Richer than palaces that lowly bed. And without staff or purse in Christ's own garb Went forth that better Israel of the Twelve, Shod with the Gospel-tidings;âwhat if then Wealth may attend and harbinger the approach Of him, whom men shall praise, adore, and serve, Christ's enemy? Are these the golden wastes, Seeds of the dragon sown to rise with men For conflict, who shall compass all about âThe Beloved City?â it defies our thought, And all conjecture. Therefore more the need To cleave unto each word, nor let it go, Which Christ hath left a lantern to our feet, And to His guiding Hand where'er it lead. Hated and fear'd, yet praised withal and served, Yea, loved too and adored, mysterious power, May be that foe of God, the incarnate sin, When time shall point and read the mystery. A scourge and a destroyer France hath seen The hammer in the hand of God, whereby He would break small the nations in His wrath, And France was wasted by him worst of all, When he led forth her armies unto death; Yet France her scourge and great destroyer loved. But this our Isle then lay amidst the storm Beneath the Almighty's shield; and from this Isle The Church sends forth her branches through the world;â Haply for some great good of God design'd, Still mindful of her Saint, our martyr'd King, For He is wont to bear the past in mind. Unless it be that in herself she fail Of her high calling; from the cries abroad Of liberty which are the breath and voice Of the great Lawless one which is to be. The mouthsâthe lion mouthsâmouths breathing flame And sulphur, mouths in head and mouths in tail, In the arm'd host of Antichrist, of which Speaks the Apocalypse;âthe dragon's mouth, Mouth of the beast, and the false prophet's mouth, Whence issue unclean spirits, full-mouth'd frogs;â What if this be the over-teeming Press, Breathing the breath of the great multitude, And with its passions fill'd; from whence go forth Daily and weekly rumours, doctrines false, And slanders; where the popular Voice enthroned Sits as the arbiter of sacred truth, Speaks from itself as from an oracle, Self-worshipping, self-listening, self-adored;â Authority and fealty set at nought;â Till pestilential is the air we breathe Unto the better life which is of God. But nought shall injure that which hath within The strength of God; for God delights to aid The soul, when most bereaved of human help; And outward persecutions hurt her not. E'en so encompass'd with her shield of light, The Church shall walk her stedfast way in Heaven Above the clouds and through them, which but seem To soil, but touch her not, nor do approach; But dwell in this our atmosphere below. Nor shall she heed the clamours of the world That rise against her, than the moon the noise Of dogs or birds of night, which at her light Prolong their angry or complaining cries. Meanwhile the signs and seasons I would read, If He who gives all wisdom would but grant The meditative eye, which as in prayer It gazes upward on the Source of Light Purges the visual ray. Age after age Hath look'd for consummation, and hath seen The folding up of this our book of life; Nor all in vain, for this our state at best Is one of such expectancy, and most To spirits most refined; such wisdom dwells With God, it is âthe mind of Christâ that waits. What if each age throws to the surface up Something that seems awhile to men that watch The coming of that wicked one, and then As waves retiring on the foaming beach Only again with a redoubled power Returning, with increase at each return? Thus imperceptibly it onward gains In preparation, for each threatening wave, Though it falls back on bosom of the deep, Yet ebbing and returning on and on Advances. Meanwhile in all shades of men There looks forth expectation; some will talk Of the great man of destiny, who yet In coming shall restore us; many see Outskirts of the great conflict; some e'en note The mystic Armageddon, some the walls Of new Jerusalem on Judah's heights, Local and temporal; in this our night Others the Babylon in which there writes The Hand of fire, which they with easy thoughts Interpret. But there is too much of earth In these our speculations; far too much Of carnal gross conception dims the eye For spiritual insight; other eyes we need To see the mighty conflict which is warr'd In heavenly places; for as Christ unseen Is deepening and progressing with His light, The darker shade associate deepens too With an intenser wickedness; as they To whom Christ's heralds witness bore in vain Shall in the Judgment meet the heavier doom Than Sodom and Gomorrha; all these signs I witness, yet I have not eyes to trace. Yet more, we ne'er shall see with carnal sight The City built upon a mountain seat, Nor Army of white horses with the eyes Of sense, nor harness'd hosts in arm'd array: But yet the mighty dread realities, Of which the symbols these and shadows are, Within us and about us even now May yet be come or coming; sights there are, Into the untried Future as we sail, Not looming on the horizon,âbut home-signs Of speedy consummation. By descent Bodies descending gather speed, so now Things hasten to their end, with new untold Rapidity; the lets too which have been, And hindrances to the vast flood of light Which is to fill the world, seem now to break And open;âerst Japan and China saw The Light, and dying Xavier left behind A train of gloryâfor awhileâthe flame Earthly became and dim, and then went out, Extinguish'd in ill savour; Holland then Was written in the book that chronicles Ill deeds of men; India, Paraguay Saw and again were darken'd; now anon Those systemsâBuddaâHindooâMahometâ By their own inborn weakness to the ground Seem crumbling of themselves; or it may be The devils leave those temples which they loved To house themselves in homes of Christendom. Meanwhile approaches fast that gathering round The City of the Saints, whate'er it be, To which the Finger of the all-seeing God Hath pointed from the dawning of the world, When Satan's chain a short while shall be loosed;â At its approach, if we are woman-born, We needs must tremble, if not for ourselvesâ Gather'd into the chambers of the grave Until this tyranny be overpast,â Yet for our little ones. But here our fears May mislead, misinterpret, set astray; So futile our conjectures of the ill Approaching, of what shape, and in what guiseâ Beforeâasideâor afterâthe assail By which âthe mightyâ and âthe manyâ fall. But this we know is safety more and more Midst ârunnings to and froâ on every side, To commune in our chamber, and be still. Yet not in indolence to sit apart, But in the silence of the heart meanwhile In going in and out, at home, abroad, To walk in circumspection, as may keep The peace of God's good Spirit, shield and helm And armoury of God. And if I might Keep one dear longing wish for those that come Hereafter, and for whom I ceaseless pray, It were that they to far benighted shores, Kingdoms of darkness, shadows of the grave, Might bear the truth we love, the pearl of price Sow with much increase, that which unto us Is dearer than the light, which unto us Is all our life, the love of God in Christ;â The law of love within, the law without Of order; but within the soul I mean Burning compassions, burning unto death, The missionary clad all o'er and girt With his Lord's lowliness, this, this is more, Far more than rich inheritance of lands, Or titled honours, or keen intellect, Or poet's power and praise; this must be sought Early and late, this ask'd with many tears,â That others might the torch thus keep alive To after generations; so myself Would sleep in peace, and though undone the work I fain would e'en myself have done, yet this I leave to His compassions in whose breast I would lay all my griefs, and hide my fears,â Griefs for myself and fears for those I love, In sorrow and in silence there would hide. And now this poor remainder of my days That sickness sets apart, if in the same To contemplation given and studious ease In loneliness of spirit, nay, say not Of ease, but studious labour, and, God grant, Labour not voiceless nor unfruitful found:â If only I so write that he who reads Might set aside anon and kneel and pray, And read again, again to pray and kneel; And so may in communion of the saints All of us unto God be raised the more. It may be that the light which is abroad Is but the warning call,âthat stirr'd thereby The pleadings of repentance which retard, Set not aside the uplifted hand of God;â For restoration often comes too late, When the appointed time hath left undone What it was given to do,âit comes too late Not for alleviation and reprieve, And penitential hopes, but comes too late To stop the path of Judgment which must have Its righteous course with nations. See afar Where England hath gone forth on foreign shores; Lift up thine eyes, and look abroad, and see, The fields are dry as stubble for the flame, Not white unto the harvest; yet howe'er Upon the green the fire shall have no power But for a pile of welcome sacrifice. 'Tis said those heavy blights, those blackening clouds Of insect tribes, impalpable as dust, Whose ravages eat up the leaf and flower, Come not till call'd for to the withering herb By Nature's beckoning hand, that the dry wind Or nipping frost first drinks the juice of life. And so 'tis ever; when let loose of God Tartar or Goth or Moslem hordes came down And ravaged all the fields where Christ had sown; 'Twas first degeneracy that bred within, And faith that on the stem hung drooping down. It was a star which fallen had from Heaven, To which the key was given that oped the abyss, Whence issued forth the tribes of living death. The life divine of Prayer and Fasting nursed Must fan the flame, must fill with vital heat, And filling must expand, expanding gain Strength, from the limbs unto the heart return, And then fill all the body with itself. Opening abroad, the fresh and sprouting leaves Send power and life unto the stock and root From whence they spring. Thus must our Church extend Into all lands and fill the Isles, or else Itself within itself shall droop and die. For when the tree hath life it branches forth Strong boughs, it spreads itself, it scatters seeds; And more confined the root and parent stock, The more it puts forth flowers and flower-born seeds, And multiplies its being. Or as wind, The type of the Great Spirit, and the fire His chariot, these do live but when they move, When they move not they are put out and die. Nor can the sword of persecution, though It lop the branches visible abroad, Cut off the secret life, but from the root It spreads and shoots more vigorous, unless The life itself be dead, and at the heart A worm born of decay preys on life's germ. When the Cross is uplifted, when again Its shadow with a darkness veils the earth, The stars shall then come forth, and here and there Pave the dim path of the approaching Morn. When those dark clouds are thickest 'mid the clouds The Cross shall then appear, and hide the sun, And God shall on His own in suffering lay His hand wherein is life; then Christian ranks Shall be together knit in mailÃ¨d strength. Oh, that mine eyelids may not droop in night! Now in the cooler evening of the day, When passion's glow is past, God's voice I hear. Oh, that to walk with Him may yet be mine! Though Conscience from His Presence fain would hide Amid the garden trees: 'mid verdant scenes Nature would soothe one to forget His voice And searching eye, which is the heart's own light. Oh, that I may not sleep the sleep of death! For âdarkness shall pursue His enemies,â 'Tis written; therefore would I look for light From Him, Him onlyâlook for it as they Who watch for morning, lest while I think not The darkness overtake me, night come down O'er the slow footsteps of declining age. That enemy must now be at the door Who shall precede His coming, of all ill The consummation; and âthe man of sin,â Judas, was hid till suddenly reveal'd, Though many warnings compass'd him about With spiritual eyes;âhis coming was at night, When most unlook'd for; when they were asleep Who should have watch'd. We know not how, nor when, But as the locust tribes which fill the air, Climb up into the house, and in each place, And hearth and home are found, so would I seek Around me and within me for the host Of that the Great Destroyer, yet to come. Meanwhile behold the Church of God abroad, So broken through the new world, through the old So overlaid, that faith itself scarce sees The light in Heaven, and love divine grows dim! 'Tis said the sun and moon shall be withdrawn, And stars in Heaven shall fall from Christ's right hand. But still is His own Presence by Himself Pledged ne'er to fail us till the end shall be. Nor can we judge of the mysterious laws Of Sacraments and gifts, and by what lines, What barriers or inclosures God hath hedged That gift of life which hidden is with Christ, How far Himself hath bound to ordinance, Channels of grace; for oft in ways untold His mercies overflow their given bounds, And pass o'er let and hindrance; if there be Those unto whom 'tis given to read the Word Brought down to man by harbingers Divine, Who therein purge by prayer the eye of faith To see the life-dispensing Three in One And seeing to adore, adoring love, And loving to obey, in all things known Of duty;âin such case we needs must think That great the hallowing power; it cannot be That prayer to God as seen in Christ reveal'd Should e'er be all in vain; it needs must be Replete with marvellous energy to draw, To quicken, to transmute, to sanctify The heart and the affections, though the seal Of Baptism be unknown, the Living Bread, And the transmitted heralds sent of God. And this we may in all assurance hope, Although we know not the degree or kind Of the impediment which in such case Mars the full gift of life; such various bounds In the large prodigality of good Which God bestows in nature countless are, Gradations melting in a thousand forms, O'erpassing laws, found in new shapes, and still Permeating through new ways, and where withheld Some compensations to supply the void, The more and less through all. The Laplander Of summer and of winter knows the change And in the sun rejoices, though so scant His beams, contending with the wastes of snow. The Moon the night may govern, and the Sun Of Righteousness, with healing in His wings, In His appointed courses thus may move With more or less of fulness, and in power More near, or distant. Albeit in the spots Most blest and quicken'd by his living beam, 'Mid the fair fruits and richest stores of life, Serpents may hide, lie nearer, bask in light. Yet in the climes where plenitude of Grace Is most impair'd, impeded, or shut out, Save but for casual gleams that overpass All hindrances of evil and neglect;â Although we know not how far in such case The Three in One, that record bear in Heaven, May in the secret soul their witness bear To sons of God; how far adulterate The seal of that true peace which passeth thought;â Yet this I deem, that none to Christ as God Can pray with a sincere though erring heart And come away unbless'd; and I in this, 'Midst the divisions sad and numberless, Confusion on confusion spread abroad Upon the face of Christendom, yet still In this I may rejoice, and do rejoice, Where Christ is named and worshipp'd. Thus on earth When He was seen in faith, though weak and dim, Yet all in their degree received of good Who came to Christ as to the Word of God, Though faith alone in Him as God the Word Had the full power of life. And now amid The strifes and the diversities and tongues, The lines and demarcations and the bounds, The âanise, mint, and cummin,â straitening more Things straiten'd and the straiten'd gate of life, This we all know and doubt not, God is Love; And to know love is so far to know God; And in this love of God is love of man. Here then be emulation, here the strife This to attain; in this we all are weak, In this halt, lame, and blind, yet this the race Is set before us, more and more to know That God is Loveâand Love will give to know. This only fails not, hence there may arise Largeness of heart and freedom to forgive; And as in those who gaze on scenes most vast And wonderful in nature,âmountain heights Or seas or stars unnumber'd,âas they gaze On such the vastness wonderful, and lost In the sublimity which fills with awe, They see not lines and spots of measured rights And properties, which all around them lie; So may we grow into the Infinite, The boundless love of God; and in that love Forget our kind and kindred, mine and thine, And all the littleness of this our lot, Except as seen in God, and God is Love, And all things seen in God are seen in Love. And thus too 'mid the controversial strife, The partâthe partyâand the party zeal, And all the sunder-partings severing men, In love they all to their dimensions sink As seen in God; and seeing them in God We shall but see them as they separate From Him. And if we bring them to His love By loving, for all love by nature is Full of attractions and of sympathies,â And if we gain them to the love of God, That love shall teach them knowledge,ânothing is Like love for soul-enlightening: love may add To what in faith is lacking, and may wait Till through the weakness of the flesh shall come The fulness of the blessing. But of Love We drink by lowly prayer, by ceaseless prayer; Love is brought down by prayer, and in the heart Spreads wings and broods and nests on our dead thoughts, Till from them it has given birth by degrees To images of love all like itself, That as God hath loved us, so we may love. Love is to Him so dear, that He hath made Our natural households counterparts of Heaven, So many centres all of partial love, Which radiate round themselves their warmth and light; Each hearth an altar of that sacred fire; Each home built up by mutual charities, With intervening ties, as centres all And little spheres of love each within each. That we may rise from such weak semblances To that diviner love, which may embrace Household and neighbourhood and distant clime. And what more seek we for those little ones That rise around us, and for our own selves, In weakness more than childhood needing aid And lumination, than from day to day To grow up into Him who is our Life, Nourish'd with milk sincere of the true Word, Pure, unadulterate with party strife, Or subtle speculations of the schools, Which secretly infuse in things of God Leaven of human frailty? systems wrought, And theories of learned conclave spun, Of faith, of works, imputed righteousness Or righteousness indwelling, straiten oft Dread mysteries of wisdom. By the Fount Welling from out the everlasting hills Be ours to sit with Jesus, and of Him To learn, beneath the patriarchal shades. In combination with these after times, Those streams that flow from 'neath the throne of God Mingle with man's infirmity; and thence, From controversial leanings, secretly Blend in their doctrines something to impair. And haply varied Churches builded up With what is local, human, temporal, To national acclimed or popular, Must needs develop something thence derived From sources frail and human; as the nurse Of constitutional inwrought disease Imparts unto the infant; which may thus With the pure milk of nature something draw Alien to health, and growing show meanwhile Impediments to full expanse of power. Therefore the truth divine I most would love Fresh springing forth within the written Word, Or where more near in upper streams it flows From out the Rock of Ages, where the Church Stands by the Cross, and solemn witness bears Wrapp'd in her Master's undivided robe. Allhallowtide. So many dropping into the Unseen, The Everlasting! when removed awhile From some associate scene wherein we dwelt A few years since, we ask, and asking find So many gone. E'en this too speaks of Peace, Setting at rest the anxious restless thoughts For this day and the morrow,âspeaks of Peace, For none of this world's troubles reach them more. 'Tis like a Sabbath that surrounds us all, So near us and about us endless rest; On our unquiet days and troubled nights It casts its shadow of eternal Peace. Straight mounts the morning smoke 'mid leafy elms, Whose green and yellow hangings half conceal And half disclose a low-thatch'd cottage roof, Peaceful and still; beneath the frost-lined eaves Twitter the birds, and feebly one or two Prolongs a cheering note; in the clear air The lowing cow proclaims the homestead near. Then the cock-crow is heard from vales below, And solitary rook sails floating by, Flapping his black wings on the vaulted blue. The shadows sleep upon the dewy ground, Save where the smoke plays with the doubtful light. And ever and anon on such a morn, As if in pity for a scene so fair, Winter doth seem as to withhold his hand, Gazing on features which so lovely are, Before his stifling grasp hath quench'd the light. But lo, to-morrow his rude harbinger Wakes, the deep-sighing wind, as no more given Warrant to spare, and says the time is come. And all the scene is changedâthe sky o'ercast, The air is full of leaves, a very shower Of the decay and fall, that emblem meet Of fleeting generations and man's life, Drifting awhile upon the wind, and borne Now up, now down, now onward, some before, Some after, yet all falling to the ground. We are like falling leaves, nay rather say As fallen, and arising in their fall, Like leaves within that fabled Sibyl's cave, Inscribed with mighty destinies, which still In vain we would decipher, while they seem To sport at random with the winds at play. âNow is the autumn of the Tree of Life;ââ We all have sinnÃ¨d, and our life decays; Our sins are like the winds that bear away. How fast we pass into the Great Unseen Which is around us! all of us are gone Or going; those but yesterday Whose eyes of love and sweet intelligence Shared mutual thought with us, are now within That place which doth surround us, which alone Stable and true appears; parts of ourselves, Like branches of one tree upon a wall, Associates of our childhood and our youth, Yea, they too of our manhood, household friends E'en of last year are there; what is yet more, We too are on the verge we soon must pass, How soon we know not; it may be this yearâ This monthâthis weekâthis dayâand we may be All suddenly awake, and the door closed Behind us, and around the unchanging year. Yet each day as it nearer brings, the while Deadens our sense of the Unseen, and lays Films o'er the spiritual eye; as when asleep Some thread of a strange dream, which we pursue, With incident and person holds the thoughts, Still loath to let it go, albeit vain And mix'd with sorrow, till the wakeful sense Breaks in upon us with substantial hand, Brushing away the spirit-tangling web. Ah, welladay!âwe yawnâsome yesterday Who spoke this lesson now themselves are gone, And 'tis to them no more a thing of words,â But we to-day still moralize, the few Left on a topmost bough, while all the rest Are harvested and gone. We rub our eyes And look around, and stretch our arms, and then We are as if we were to be for aye, Conversing of necessity and death For images of pastime, till the past And present, and the living and the dead, Blend in our dreams together. For in truth Man's spirit knows not death, but sets aside The interlinear boundaries of the flesh, And in its thoughts, which are its proper self, Holds intercourse with those which are unseen As if they were still with us. Now again Nature herself the lesson hath resumed Of her autumnal shades; prelusive signs In the cool freshness of the dewy morn, And in the comings on of chilly eve Speak of approaching winter. Shadows huge Upon the mountain sides or green mown fields Lie beautiful, like massy heaps or drifts Of stationary darkness, yet anon, Long motionless, they move, and moving show The calm of Heaven the more, like sounds that make The stillness audible;âto bring on man Reflection suited to declining age, Seasons of meditation; all the air, And nature's self in all the things that live Is eloquent with wisdom, of decay Speaking to man and of approaching death. I pause, and listen, and would drink full deep Into my inner spirit all the words She speaks in living imagery, or writes On pages of the elements; for such I deem not but an idle fancy's toys To deck the moral, or the poet's tale, The metaphor and image, to adorn Delineations of autumnal life, And give the form and colour to the page. But I would hear them as the Voice of God Speaking to us through nature, His still Voice The which alone to hear and understand Is wisdom; mighty boon, great privilege Vouchsafed to few! That Voice from Heaven of old Which spake to Christ in speaking seem'd to some But thunder, unto some angelic sounds Divine in sweetness, to the mind of Christ Audible only as the Voice of God. And when to Paul at midday o'er the sun, As in a sheet of lightning, Christ appear'd, Paul only heard the Voice of Him that spake. And therefore in the Autumnal signs I pray, That hearing I may hear the Voice of God, Not as the beasts that perish. It is this Which gives a living tongue from other worlds To seasons and their change; to sights and sounds Gives utterance, makes them more than Angel-tongued. O Thou that teachest knowledge unto man, Who givest the seeing eye, the hearing ear, Whom to love is to know, to know is life, Teach me to hear Thee, and with eyes and ears Take in Thy counsels sent to one that's born To live with Thee for ever. Linear signs Are on the dial's face, all dead and mute In their significance, until the sun Shines on them; and the written face abroad Of nature, and Thy book of life itself Is dead and profitless, until Thy Sun, The living Spirit of Incarnate God, Shines on them. Not alone be mine to read What Matthew wrote or John by Thee inspired, And Chrysostom and Austin taught of Thee; But oft, when rising up from these I take My solitary walk, and muse alone In the fresh morn without, in all may hear Thy voices numberless, nay rather say That still small Voice alone, wherein so oft Thou speakest to the inner heart of man. The thunder, and the whirlwind, and the fireâ These were but to arouse and humble man, That he in awe might listen, when his God Would speak unto his heart; the Judgments loud That walk abroad, and with their iron tread Shake kingdoms, or o'erthrow the hearth and home In household visitations, whirlwind-voiced, What are they? but the herald's warning cry, The sterner preparations which precede When Thou wouldst speak unto the heart alone;â E'en as that herald trump which shall be heard 'Midst the loud last convulsions of the world, Before that silence when that awful Voice Most stilly, yet more loud than falling worlds, Shall thrill the deep abysses of the soul, That whisper which shall never pass away, âCome unto Me, ye blessed!â Therefore meet This very stillness of the autumnal day I deem, to listen for the awful sound, The stillness wherein God would speak to man. âHarvest is past, the summer at an end, And we not saved;â so the Prophet speaks Who long'd to lodge in some vast wilderness, And over Israel wept. Is it e'en so Of that our summer which knows no return, Once for all gone? The spring and summer-time Of our short life on silver-plumÃ¨d wings Have vanish'd; all their morning hopes that caught The gladdening Eye of Heaven; the clouds that pass'd And passing dropp'd in tears, yea, days that shook And spake in thunder-voices to the soul, And winds that came loaded with heavy thoughts And ruffled us awhile; and gloomy days That seem'd from us to shut the light of Heaven:â The many mornings we have waked to sense, To day-dreams sadder than our sleeping thoughts,â The many days that lifted up themselves That we might not discern the sound, nor hear Beat on the earth their multitudinous feet That bore us to the grave; eager desires That buoy'd us and gave wings; affections, too, Which had too much of earth, and therefore took From what was due to Heaven; gleams of bright love Which bathed our steps in sunshine for awhile, Yet sped not on our journey;âtender ties Of kindred which wove chains about our heart, Part of itself, yet all the while by prayer Not sanctified, nor link'd unto the Throne, The hidden life with God;âthen halcyon days, And clear transparent streams, where serpents rose, 'Mid green tufts floating in their glassy deeps, And pass'd in speckled beauty on the wave In morning hours of spring: all, all are gone, Afflictions too, and sore bereavements stern, That seem'd to squeeze the heart all full of tears Till it was dry, yea, very dry, nor had One drop remaining, yet again at sight Of pity flow'd anew all full of tears, As if its stores were endless, or the Rock Within it had been smitten with the rod, And Christ, the Crucified, became within A fountain of fresh pity never dry;â But that, too, pass'd beneath the scorching sun Of the unfeeling world. The summer then Was on us, and alas! in the world's sun The ripening of affections. Greater aims And large aspiring thoughts have been awhile Like building up of stately palaces Of goodly presence and commanding air, And bright in sunshine, basking airy towers Which hid their golden heads in the blue sky; A fair assemblage, not of chambers meet For pride or pleasure, but of holy shrines, Towers to devotion sanctified; yet now The tide of time, or like an ocean vast The shoreless and unseen eternity, With time its ebbing and returning tide, Washes the base, and tries if all be built Upon the Rock of Ages. All that's built On Christ is built in lowliness, with self Subdued and buried, so that when we fail There may be something which can bear us up, Above that infinite of after-death, With omnipresent, everlasting power; That neither death, nor life, nor height, nor depth, Nor angels, and dominions of the Unseen, Nor things that present are, nor things to come, The soul may shake from her sure resting-place, Or sever from the love of God in Christ. Not what we leave behind of good report Or goodly-seeming deeds, but what with us We take to follow, this shall clothe the soul With living spiritual wings, and bear her up Unto the gate of Heaven, to greet the Morn Of Resurrection, and return with Him That brings the Day which sets notâwhen at last The golden-crownÃ¨d Reaper shall descend, Sitting on a white cloud, and in His hand The sickle; and the angelic voice shall cry, âThrust in the sickle, for the earth is ripe For harvest,ââand 'tis answer'd, âAll is done.â E'en now He is descending on the earth, And in descending pauses for a while And gives to man the season and the space For preparation and reflections meet. It is the Autumn of the fleeting year, It is the Autumn of declining age, It is the Autumn of the fading world, Which like the life of man throws fast behind All that it once so prized and doated on. Where are the mighty nations which have been? And where their cities? sea-crown'd Tyre and Troy, Carthage and LacedÃ¦mon, either Thebes, Wall'd Babylon, and ancient Nineveh, And all the thousand cities which had thought To live for ever? Where their crownÃ¨d heights? Where their foundations? O'er the silent wastes Where not a stone remains, the Echo sighs, âNo more,ââoh, what a word is that âNo more,â Written on all that has been! while the past Eats up the present, preys on it, pursues So swiftly, that the empires of the world E'en in their very being are like clouds Fast fleeting, while in fleeting they disclose The everlasting kingdom of the Saints, Amid the places of the gathering Dead. Behold, the Reaper is descending seen, And then the vision and the scene is changed, He comes, and in His hand He bears the fan To purge His floor, and gather in His barn; And then shall an angelic voice repeat The Prophet's plaint and Nature's yearly cry;â âYe had your summerâbut 'tis ended now; The harvest of the earth is come and gone!â âAnd we not saved?â Let this warning voice Sound in our ears, and waken all within That's capable of fear; for short must be The time, whate'er it be, which oft from Heaven God hath declared is short: then sweet, with sound Like music's very self, the voice that speaks Of interval between, of time yet given, Of summer not yet gone, nor harvest past, Though short indeed the time;âbut not yet gone Nor ended; sweet to know in this reprieve The inexhausted goodness of our God. âI hear, and ere they speak will answer them.â âCome unto Me, and I will give you rest;â âSeek Me, and ye shall find.â Then I will seek; Unto Him will I come, to Him will speak; And He shall answer me, and give me rest. His Providence and Grace shall gird me round And aid me, till e'en yet I find His peace;â Shall aid me, though it be with seeming war; Shall press me, though it be with Hand severe; Making the world to me a stepdame stern, Not mine own mother, or a mournful place Of ruins, or a land possess'd of foes; That when I ask of it for its sweet songs, A grief may answer me; when I would pluck Its flowers, a thorn may warn me back, to fear And nothing find to lean upon. The fields Of Autumn, and the falling leaves, and cold And moaning winds that speak like tearful sighs, May all the soul attune to sad regrets; Till Winter's self shall come, and o'er these sights Of desolation, with her covering pall Gently let fall her virgin robe from Heaven, Bringing on nature's grave her silvery veils, And spangled plumes of white. The ethereal space The clouds are traversing; upon the earth Fleet mighty shadows, as if o'er our heads Angelic wings were moving in the skies On embassies of love; and o'er the soul Pass solemn sadnesses from the Unseen, Disposing to reflection, and such thoughts As may the heart make better, turning grief To pensiveness of wisdom, not unmeet For sights that are without which speak of love That may that sorrow lighten. What are these Upon the wings of the departing year So beautiful around us? day by day Decays that put on beauty, verdant slopes Wherein all hues are mingling, yet distinct In order'd fair gradations, rainbow tints That seem to lay on earth amidst its tears The promises of Heaven. What are these signs? Calm mornings as the mists have clear'd away And ope the face of Heaven, fruits ere they fall Hanging in beauteous fulness, spangled drops That catch in radiant gems the smiles of Heaven; The creeping woodbines as by fairy hands Led up on verdant branches, as if taught To show their flowery bells on foreign stems, And others matted o'er, a very cloud Of hanging beauty on the hedges wild, And all the glowing riches of the time Gladdening the hearts of men:âwhat are these signs? What is their language? 'tis, I fear, by man Mislearn'd, misconstrued, misinterpreted; Such are but footsteps of the Almighty God Walking abroad in goodness, and the light That marks His presence as He passes by, Like as when manifest to eyes of flesh He went forth doing good and healing all; That sadness and disease and death itself Stay'd not His Presence, but departing fled. Yet what were these but tokens, that to Him All men henceforth in faith might turn, nor rest With outward signs and gifts of but a day, But seek in Him the eternal Day of God, Where no disease comes nigh? for those His gifts Were but for time; disease and death that fled Again return'd with mandate to destroy. He gave the wondrous bread with His own hands Creative, but in giving o'er them grieved, âSeek Me not for the bread which hath sustain'd Your dying bodies, but the better Bread Which cometh down from Heaven, for He that feeds Your dying bodies is the Bread of souls.â Seek not His gifts, but in His gifts seek Him, The Giver, and the Gift Unspeakable, That which is Bread indeed and very Life. So Nature's outward tokens shed abroad Should lead us from these gifts to pass in faith To Him that promises, in nought to rest, In nothing to rejoice, but in those things Which He declares good for the immortal soul, The things that make us meet on Him to wait, In Him to serve Him and on Him to rest, By Him to find Himself who is the Life. O miserable thankfulness! in these The daily tokens of parental care To overflow with gratitude, and yet Forget the higher things which He would give, And love of Him the Giver; better 'twere To mourn and in an aching void of heart, Amid the bounties of the teeming year, To feel a desolation all around, An emptiness of all that satisfies, Without the truer life which is in God. There is no death like that which puts on life, Or seeming life, which only lives to die, Lives more the more abundantly to die In signs of wealth or power, wherein the soul Dies ne'er to live againâwhile Nature fades I hear a better wisdom walk abroad, In sympathies of solemn tenderness. Our friends are dropping from usâor from sight Are hidden or estranged, as we ourselves Draw to the Unseen Land: 'tis so, O Lord, Thou fain wouldst lead us to depend on Thee, With us alone in dyingâlead our thoughts To Thee and those with Thee beyond the grave. 'Tis the Autumnal Hallowmas, and now The season mindful of the sacred dead Brings on our path the household of the Saintsâ Gather'd into the garner safe from harm. The Deadâthe mighty Deadâhow they around From out their generations look on us, As worms of yesterday, that creep and lift Our heads unto the moonâand then depart! Many the Saints whom we revere and love, By intercourse of books in converse held, The stars that beautify our nightly Heaven, And then in silent watches seem brought near; But when we turn to Theeâand Thee behold, And in beholding Thee adore and love Thy Manhood full of Godhead, 'tis the Sun Compared with whom the stars have disappear'd; For we have life and light within Thy beams, And all things we behold on every side Have life and light in Theeâin Thee the year Wanes not, nor knows of an Autumnal shade; For in Thee there is Life, and Light, and Love. Now is Thy kingdom come, but not to bring The short-lived seasons and the changing moon And self-returning year, its circles still Inwreathing, but Thy Coming to prepare, The Bride to wed with that great spousal ring Which is eternity. The Sundays now That bear us on with the declining year In Name and purpose speak the Unchangeable,â Creator, Saviour, sanctifying Guide, Which was, which is, and which is yet to be, The mystery of Godhead, Three in One. And he that rightly hath received Thee Hath in himself a living Trinity; In body, soul, and spirit fill'd with Thee, And therefore fill'd with light; Night become Day, The world a new creation, wherein shines The Lamb Himself, the everlasting Light. And what are these our Sundays bearing on Summer and Autumnâbut the marble steps, Steps of obedience in the Triune God, Who is our Temple, building up in Him In whom there are no seasons of decay And no Autumnal signs? Around us now And in usânearer than the air we breathe, Is omnipresent power of endless Love; For God is Love; and wheresoe'er we be It is to breathe in Heaven that love to know, To know it more and more. And thanks to Thee In the revealing of Thyself below, Who nothing hast required but faith in Thee, That we may to Thy Godhead entrance find And into all Thy love. At every step Faith in Thy power, Thy goodness, and Thy truth Was as the threefold cord around the soul, By which Thou in Thy ways wouldst draw to Thee,â E'en as a cord held out to drowning men By which they o'er the billows pass secure. What doth this lengthen'd Season teach but love, Uniting in the bond of Three in One, Since from his midday tower of Pentecost Descends the Sun that rules our sacred year? The Easter Morn is every week restored, Our Sundays all one glowing Whitsuntide, Like Sabbaths of one Jubilee, that pass And yet are ever present; for 'tis now One Easter Morn, one Sabbath all the year; Which hath the hidden Manna stored with God, Imparted unto each as worthy found. His presence o'er His tabernacle dwells, The sheltering Cloud becomes the pillar'd Flame,â In the hot day a shade of dewy night, In the dark night a gleam of genial day,â While still the Church, a pilgrim Heavenly led, From week to week her journey travels on, From Pentecost to Advent, to our view Unfolding some new mercies of our God, Some manifold disclosures of His love From out His written Word, which thus anew From Sunday unto Sunday makes to bloom The desert like a rose, and makes to rise Rivers of water in the wilderness. For such by meditation they become Still week by week renew'dâeach Sunday fresh With its own lesson for the passing week, Palm-trees and verdant springs:âno more we need But that from well-spring of the heart within, They should in word and action flow around, And turn us more to prayer. In prayer to live It needs that all without be desolate, The soul itself feel poor and needing aid, And comfortless, that it may earnest seek The Comforterânay, should with anxious fears Be straiten'd, and as one in straits, herself Gird up for the strait gate and narrow way, And feel the harvest past, the summer gone, And we not saved; so perchance that fear May save us, ere the summer hath gone by And harvest come indeed. And why again Doth nature thus around us and within, Upon our bodyâfriendsâall cherish'd thingsâ Household and home-bred creaturesâall we love And valueâset her signs of sure decayâ Upon the yearâthe dayâon all we prize? Surely these are the unnumber'd tongues Divine Calling to preparation:âlest we wake Suddenlyâon the gulf that yawns below Worse than annihilation, at the sight Grow dizzy in despair; as one that comes In some Norwegian pass upon a cliff,â Nor fixing his firm eye on things above To stablish and direct his tottering feet,â Looks on a fathomless abyss below, And gazing is bewilder'd and self-lost Fallsâoh, that we in better hopes may stand! Therefore upon the landscape varied now With lights and shades, serene and beautiful As footsteps of retiring deity In Homer's gods departing;âtherefore now Upon the riches of the fading year, And all the beauties of its going hence, With swallows gathering round in the fresh morn In council and debate, and still anon Trying the wheeling of the joyous wing, In prelude of their flight, with their adieu Cheerful and blithe to summer hours gone by;â On scenes that once were summer, in their wane All animate and beauteous, I will look, And thence will gather faith in the Unseen Not to despair; and while the year yet waits, Lest I despair at last, unto the last Always to fear; yea, from despair itself To gain sweet hope, as in a dungeon dark Men turn to faintest glimmering of the light, Seen by degrees, and cherish it the more. And what if breath of winter passes now Upon the spring and summer of my days,â Thence will I gain my hope; when in the dark I sit, the Lord Himself shall be my Light. Wilt Thou not give me, Lord, far more than these? Wilt Thou not give Thyself? Are these Thine all? For what else would I seek but Thee on earth, And what in Heaven but Thee? Alas! so great Thy goodness, so unwilling to deny Whate'er the secret soul of Thee may ask, The unexpress'd desire, the harbour'd thought, Wishing to give the greater, yet the less Not willing to withhold; and to the prayer Too weak in faith to pierce the distant skies, Thou leanest down, to hear the feebler wish Which hath too much of earth. And now, O Lord, As retrospective to the past I turn And summer suns that shined, Thy very gifts Confound me, and bow down my face with shame; For well I know there is no ill on earth But Thee to lose, no good but only Thee. Wilt Thou not give me, Lord, far more then these? Thou that hast given me choicest things of earth, Things that an early fancy dared to wish, Too wedded to the worldâThou that from High Letst Thyself down to my poor low desires, And listenedst to my whisper'd cravings mean; Children and friends, and honour, and a home, And sacred ease, and books both new and old, And thoughts that from the well-spring of the heart Flow forth in learned leisure,âwilt Thou not Bestow far more than these things? Ah, alas! That I should such have prized, content with these, E'en o'er Thy mercies could I sigh and mourn;â âMy Father, Thou hast given me Southern lands, Wilt Thou not give me also water springs,â That o'er Thy very mercies I may weep? I cannot grieve unless Thou give me tears: My life is as the valley of dead bones, Which cannot of themselves, unless Thou call, Which cannot of themselves arise and live, Unless on the dead bones Thy Spirit breathe And clothe with flesh and sinews of new life, New lifeâlest I should die the second death, New life in the New Man, ere yet my feet Be slipperiness and darkness, and the mists Of age mine eyelids close to things of Heaven, Unnerve my hands, enfeeble my stiff knees, And the inner darkness compass me around, Which knows no morning, has no morning star. âKnock, and it shall be open'd.â O blest words! To Thee I knock in prayer that Thou mine eyes Wilt open, that I may behold my sin, And in beholding mourn, still mourn until The winter of my sorrow brings a spring Of Resurrection; welcome, wintry rain, And cold, to my dry heart, welcome awhile, That I in desolation may work on, Till haply gradual change e'en yet may come. Behold the trees, they are as winter dead, Naked and leafless; look again awhile, And they are all of verdant summer full, Embowering many branches,âmany leaves; And so within the soul a little while And there may be a change. O blessed change, More blessed when unknown! O healthful need, Which hungers after righteousness, and pines, And feeling its own want is fill'd the more;â The want of an undying, exiled soul For its own homeâits restâits foodâits life Which is in God; which wakes to know itself Feeding on husks, and weepsâweeps to behold Its own forgetfulness that could so long Have laugh'd and play'd, and with such empty things Been satisfied, and gloried; on itself Gazing in kingly robes upon the stage Within the glass of vanity, nor knew Itself a beggar poor, a captive mean. But Thou wilt âbring me to the wilderness, And there wilt speak of comfort to my soul; Till Achor's valley be the door of hope, And she may sing as in the days of youth.â Lo, all things now around me speak of rest, The Christian's heritage, rest amid scenes Of sadness and decay, a rest in Godâ Sweet prelibation of eternal peace. Therefore not childhood only, and new youth, But old age and decay, declining day, And Autumn in it hath of power divine, Cognate unto a Christian's better life, The peace which passeth knowledge; as a ship That on a tranquil eve, as storms have ceased, Drops its worn sail, and glides unto the shore In some calm shelter'd bay, and hides itself From winds and waves that harass'd it so long, In haven and in quiet anchorage. Such scenes disposing to eternal peace Woo all my thoughts abroad, which I to God Would consecrate, and listen, till the heart, By their deep influences soothed and still'd, Rightly interpret to the eye and ear The parable of the Autumnal Eve. So may I walk awhile, if it be given, In fear, while it may be ânor clear nor dark,â If only âin the evening it be light.â Then daily with my children may I read Morn after morn Thy Gospel, and from thence Bedew my wither'd spirit with fresh dews Of the Everlasting Morning which attends Thy doings; from Thy healing hands gain hope, Fear from Thy sacred lips; and so may I With little ones around on Wisdom tend Instructing Childhood and of Childhood taught, That their sweet innocence may Conscience wake, Slumbering o'er the remembrance of the past, To trim her lamp and knock at Mercy's door That opens:âso may I at evening time Gain light, and watch with hope the lengthening shades. THE END.</field>
