      <field name="fulltext">The Sonnet's humble plot of ground. Wordsworth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY SISTER MARY. Sister! accept these lays: as yet I ween No lay but mine has open'd with thy name; I would I were a bard of mightier fame, Then would this tribute of more price have been, And thou hadst worn a costlier pledge, in sign Of my deep love: My name is all unknown, And daring not to venture forth alone It fondly seeks companionship of thine— And thou dost love me more than to believe Thy brother's lay can furnish shame to thee: Critics! be your dispraise from harshness free And scornful gibe, nor give me cause to grieve, For, if ye sternly say I cannot sing, My Sister's name is on a shamed thing! SONNETS. Twenty-three of these sonnets have been extracted here as they were revised and republished in Small Tableaux (1868). IV. TO THE NIGHTINGALE. O! honey-throated mourner of the grove! That in the glooming woodland art so proud Of answering thy sweet mates in soft or loud, Thou dost not own a note we do not love! The moon is o'er thee—laying out the lawn In mighty shadows—and the twilight skies, Imbued with their unutterable dyes, A thousand hues from Summer sources drawn; While wandering for the dreams such seasons give With lonely steps thro' this transcendant scene, The Poet weeps for joys that fled yestreen And staid not here to bless this purple eve, Too lately fled, and brought him here to grieve In passionate regret for what hath been. VII. [Hence with your jeerings, petulant and low] Hence with your jeerings, petulant and low, My love of home no circumstance can shake, Too ductile for the change of place to break, And far too passionate for most to know— I and yon pollard-oak have grown together, How on yon slope the shifting sunsets lie None knew so well as I, and tending hither Flows the strong current of my sympathy; From this same flower-bed, dear to memory, I learnt how marigolds do bloom and fade And from the grove that skirts this garden glade I had my earliest thoughts of love and spring: Ye wot not how the heart of man is made, I learn but now what change the world can bring! XII. [O be thou keen to guess when Flattery's near!] O be thou keen to guess when Flattery's near! His face is not the shadow of his heart; The Court is all for lucre, like the mart, And fraught with perils that a king should fear— Trust not the flatterer's hollow sympathy For should'st thou fathom that dishonest sound, The line would rise with noisome clays hung round And not the fruitful loam of love for thee: O ill-starr'd royalty! Love's balmy sighs Where Truth breathes on us from her sweetest shrine— The access to all pure delights and ties,— Say are they less the peasant's lot than thine? Beyond the Shepherd's bliss thou can'st not rise And many snares to steal ev'n that combine. XIII. [No trace is left upon the vulgar mind] No trace is left upon the vulgar mind By shapes which form upon the poet's thought In instant symmetry: all eyes are blind Save his, for ends of lowlier vision wrought; Think'st thou, if Nature wore to every gaze Her noble beauty and commanding power Could harsh and ugly doubt withstand the blaze Or front her Sinai Presence for an hour? The seal of Truth is Beauty—When the eye Sees not the token, can the mission move? The brow is veil'd that should attach the tie And lend the magic to the voice of Love: What wonder then that doubt is ever nigh Urging such spirits on to mock and to deny? XV. [The foot of Time so soundless never pass'd] The foot of Time so soundless never pass'd As when sweet fancy wove her magic thralls— Go, mourner, to the Muses, haste thee, haste, And bring thy gifts where Peter's shadow falls To heal thee in his passing: call for aid Of joy, that quenches being and it's gall— Sad! that the consciousness of Life must fade Before the bliss it yields be felt at all: We cannot sit, inertly calm'd, to hear The silence broken by the step of life; We must have music while we languish here, Loud music, to annul our spirit's strife, To make the soul with pleasant fancies rife, And soothe the stranger from another sphere! XVIII. [We cannot keep delight—we cannot tell] We cannot keep delight—we cannot tell One tale of steady bliss, unwarp'd, uncrost, The timid guest anticipates farewell, And will not stay to hear it from his host! I saw a child upon a Summer's day, A child upon the margin of a pond, Catch at the boughs that came within his way, From a fair fruit-tree on the bank beyond; The gale that sway'd them from him aye arose, And seldom sank into such kindly calm As gave his hand upon the bunch to close, Which then but left it's fragrance on his palm; For the wind woke anew from its repose, And bore the fruit away, but wafted all its balm. XXII. [See'st thou her blushes, that like shadows sweet] See'st thou her blushes, that like shadows sweet Pass upward from the silence of the heart, Avowing it's fond dream by token meet— Their crimson traits dissolve, but not depart The hopes they usher to the lover's breast; The signature has melted from the bond, But he doth trust it, asking nought beyond What promise all so briefly hath imprest: Deep in her virgin heart has sunk the glow— But thou hast cull'd its promise, and to thee If lapse of faith or dark misdoubt should be, 'Twill steal into the blenching face of wo, Chide back thy pulse to its remitted flow, And tinge despondent thought and misery. XXXI. [O! it is sweet to weave aërial ties] O! it is sweet to weave aërial ties With fair and fond creations of our own, To keep the spirit buoyant on the rise Of that unebbing joyance which alone Engrosses life,—The consciousness of power To sluice pure waters from the fount of song, And far in lordly eminence to tower Above the world on pinions swift and strong; Confronting greatness in her every form, By the deep sea, and where the thunders lower To pour from out their skirts th' Atlantic storm; To keep unfading impress of each hour That Nature's beauty hallows, and to know Which is the purest tone her voice doth yield below! XXXIX. GREECE. Written on hearing the rumour of Prince Leopold's expedition. Now are we free to roam thy flowery dales, Fair Greece! and where each ancient fountain flows; Now are we frée to cull the lily' and rose, That bloom so sweetly down thy noble vales: And ye are free, Arcadian nightingales, To lavish on the air your tuneful woes, That sweetly rise and with all sweetness close Where high Lycæus breathes of rural tales And Pan, and jealous Lucretil surpast: The fanes upon each ruin-cover'd wold, They too are free to crumble undefac'd, For Britain's future poets to behold, That they may hold that sum of memories fast Which is their dowry from the days of old! XL. [On from the spot that saw it's first essay] On from the spot that saw it's first essay The earthquake travell'd—mark ye how he strove! While ruin, aye attendant on his way, Sped swiftly o'er the cleaving realms above: Slowly the seasons do transform the grove, All other change is wrought with soft delay But this, which drives the course of streams astray Once and for evermore: When to remove Earth from her deep foundations God doth will, The work is done with noises thunder-loud And lightning-speed: Such ministers fulfil The 'hests of Him, by whom the Heavens are bow'd When he descendeth down on Zion hill, While darkness is beneath him like a cloud! XLII. [His was a chamber in the topmost tower] His was a chamber in the topmost tower, A small unsightly cell with grated bars; And wearily went on each irksome hour Of dim Captivity and moody cares! Against such visitants he was not strong, But sate with laden heart and brow of woe, And every morn he heard the stir and song Of birds in royal gardens far below, Telling of bowers and dewy lawns unseen, Drench'd with the silver steam that night had left— Part blossom-white, part exquisitely green, And ringing all with thrushes on the left, And finches on the right, to greet the sheen Of the May-dawn; while he was thus bereft! XLIV. [Sweet brother-soul! I may not tarry here] Supposed to be written by any feeble-minded man, meditating self-destruction. Sweet brother-soul! I may not tarry here, The grave is made for me—if joy had been But rarely visitant or dimly seen, I would not thus have call'd the distance near, Or summon'd for my peace this early bier: But happiness long-while hath kept aloof, An alien to my heart, which was not proof Against the lacking of a thing so dear: The hour is drawing nigh, when this wild heart Shall be the thrall of worms, and know it not, As calm as peace can be. No pulse or start Of reviviscence, till the life hath got Its flow again, which had but ebb'd in part: But never more to feel the sinner's earthly lot! XLV. TO A. H. H. When youth is passing from my hoary head, And life's decline steals brightness from thine eye— But that it cannot soon, nor quench the red Upon thy cheek that hath so rich a dye— Then of what crowns of fame may thou and I Avow ourselves the gainers? with what balm Of christian hope, devotionally calm, Shall I be then anointed? will this sigh, Born of distempered feeling, still come forth As thus, unjoyous? or be left to die Before the rapid and unpausing birth Of joyous thoughts succeeding momently? What would not such recoil of bliss be worth, Replacing in our age this early loss of joy? XLVII. TO ? A lovely vision fading out of sight, Pure waters fast a-draining, these may be Apt semblance of a truth well known to thee, Poor pallid maid! thou can'st not reunite Nor blend again the colours of thy heart,— The secret nurture of a healthy mind Will long preserve, perchance may half impart, The cheek's pure glow, to sorrow ne'er assigned; But thine is cold and pale, as might beseem A rose-bud planted in a vase of snow, Which droops full soon, as it did surely know Of the thin flakes collapsing round its stem; E'en thus thy cheek has lost its vital glow, Because there is no source of kindly warmth below! LINES. [And art thou gone unto the skies] And art thou gone unto the skies, And is thine home that happy spot, Where meet the saintly and the wise, Where God is prais'd and tears are not? I keep a record in my thought Of all thy soft endearments here, And often stealeth in unsought Thy promise of a better sphere: For whither can thy spirit wend? If not to bliss, O! not to bale,— And art thou nothing? Heaven forefend! And truth disclaim the dreary tale! When goodness fades from earth and ill, From all the joys it shar'd and gave, Sure,—sure, the links are lengthen'd still, Tho' viewless upward from the grave. The tie of faith is gently drawn By memory of thy taintless soul; I see the day-spring and the dawn, And hope has soar'd beyond control! [Ye mighty forests, deep and old] Ye mighty forests, deep and old, With knotty stems and towering shade, That, where the lordly streams are rolled, A dense and matted gloom have made. Your arms are rife with germs of life, Your heads receive the rushing wind: With lingering sweeps the night-breeze creeps O'er your thick robes and wrinkled rind: Ye stand like shrouds before the clouds, That hold the sunset of mid-June— And darker still, when o'er the hill Creeps the pale dawning of the moon. O then the soft suffusion clear Peers over your enormous screen, The skies are white with silver light, How grand the shade! how sweet the sheen! And when the sun's first rosy line Is drawn i' th' east—thro' every glade Aglow with golden dews ye shine, And orange-tints your depths pervade! A FATHER TO HIS SLEEPING CHILD. Say, can the ocean sands outnumber The feelings fond and fatherly, Which o'er thy softly pillow'd slumber So oft have warm'd this heart for thee? Who in thy days of health so cheerful, Of sickness who so fondly fearful? And now in ceaseless watch I stand Lest pain's most pangless touch should slay; The snow-flake scarcely meets the hand That steals its slight-knit life away; Tho' hope disclaims thy fragile mould, I would not hear thy death-bell toll'd. I love thy glossy curls which close Upon thine eye-sight, golden-bright, Or rest upon the damask rose Of thy warm cheek, with lightsome freight; And those sweet eyes, so blue and deep, Beneath the tranquil lids of sleep! Thy lips, my child, recall the smile Of those I would not show thee now, And she who blest my life awhile Has left her spirit on thy brow: O doubly dear, now she is cold, I would not hear thy death-bell toll'd! Her voice was musical and low, Of thrilling tone like sounds in sleep; And, like the foot-fall in the snow, Heard faintly, tho' it sink so deep: And thy soft accents are the same, Thou hast her voice—her look—her name! My life will wear a sunny guise If thou wilt dwell on earth with me, And every morrow's sun will rise To greet my sight delightfully: With thee, throughout the live-long day, To sing my gloomy thoughts away. But if 'tis fate that thou depart, My heart will, must with sorrow bleed, But God shall find that shatter'd heart As lowly as the bending reed, And I will live resign'd and high In hope to meet ye in the sky! DIXIT ET AVERTENS &amp;c. VIRG. ÆN. II. When Venus, late like wood-nymph drest Departing breath'd diviner soul, When downward flowed her gather'd vest, And godhead o'er the huntress stole, How lovely must the change have been! How beautiful the shifting mien! I would I had been there to see That burst of nobler charms and higher, Losing in prouder symmetry The simple lineaments of Tyre, Tho' but a moment she delay'd, In glory of great beauty clad. And stay, oh! stay, the hero cried, As far—far off—the vision shot, Why is thy conference denied, Or granted, when I know thee not? And thus, at last, to break the spell But saddens more thy bright farewell! TO A DYING FRIEND. No—never—no—I feign would linger Near friendship passing to the tomb, To close thy lids with trembling finger, And kiss the cheek that cannot bloom. For, as by mercy's kind concession, To soothe the mourner, who remains, Full many a trace of life's expression The earliest hour of death retains. Affection's dictates still obeying, I'll thus stay by thee, while a trace, The faintest trace, and that decaying, Yet lurks within so dear a face. [The council of the brave are met] The council of the brave are met, Soon will their swords with blood be wet, The blood of tyranny and pride, On—on—this is not regicide! He thinks his sand is not outrun, But he shall start to find it done; He mocketh at our bold emprize, Tho' Freedom looks him in the eyes. What claim have they on further breath, For momentary league with death, Who dare to make the human heart Throb with the fears themselves impart? And he hath done this shameless deed, Thus answered in a nation's need; He link'd our fetters to his crown So tight, they burst, and flung him down. When kings demand with haughtiest aims Beyond their weight of kingly claims, With worthy scorn and anger stirr'd, We fill the balance with the sword! Every one must remember the sublime action of Camillus here alluded to. We seek a soil for hope to thrive— But where is hope, if tyrants live? We burn to draw a bolder breath By quenching his in forceful death! Slaves, each and all, our necks have borne His yoke with grief that swallow'd scorn, Till, galling deeper, it began To make all men, and each a man! COMETS. With mighty bulk along the sky They sped—I saw their trains so bright! Yet never taper's spark went by With less delay upon the sight— I mark'd they were too vast for thought, Yet sudden distance made them nought. ANACR. ??? ???????. ??????????? ??, ??????, &amp;c. Cicala, we pronounce thee blest For that, on topmost shrubs at rest, When thou has quaff'd a little dew, Thou singest as a king may do: For thine is each and every thing Thou viewest in the meads of spring, Or what the other seasons bring. Thou art the friend of those that till, For working none the least of ill. We men revere thee far and wide, Sweet prophet of the summer-tide! The Muses love thee. Phœbus loves As his own gift, thy song, approves: Thou art not worn away by age, Earth-born, a songster, and a sage; A pangless and a bloodless frame,— Thou art a god, or much the same. ???? ???? ?? ???????. ANACR.— A bee, within a rose-bud lying, 'Scap'd the Infant Love's espying; With finger stung and sobbing cry Quick to fair Venus did he fly, “Mother,” he said, “I faint, I die!” This wound, a little winged snake, Which rustics call a bee, did make. But she answered, “If the sting “Of bees be such a painful thing, “What think'st thou of their bitter smart, “The hapless Victims of thy dart?” ?? ?????? ??? ?????, &amp;c. ANACR.— Cupid, bound in flowery bands, The Muses placed in beauty's hands: And still, in vain, does Venus sue To win him back by ransom due; Little recks he of such demands, Nor whence they come—but stays with beauty, He hath learnt a bondsman's duty. [O, but this hollow skull] O, but this hollow skull Hangs heavy on the noblest hopes we have! Dost thou not think it doth? That passion's host Are all disbanded, and the war is done,— This is the best of promise proffer'd here: Thou tell'st me that all argument from hence Is matter out of place; that when I deem We may not live again, pitching my doubt On the most obvious spot for doubt to fall, That I do idly thus, to step aside From the high road of Truth to see a skull; That God hath given the Victory to hope, A giant of great strength, whom heaven hath form'd To battle with all poison? That mistrust Would vanish, were I conscious of the strength Of this Messiah—I will muse awhile— The Creed, that makes thee happy, shall be mine. TO ? Think'st thou if spirits pure as thine Through life might be for ever near, I should not every fear resign, As from my boyhood's home I steer? But 'tis not so—my heart must bleed With thorns amid a world of guile, Snows to my rosy clime succeed, And cunning's cant to Virtue's smile. O, say, is not this mournful span Between the cradle and the pall, Is not this weary life of man A scene of rude transitions all? A mother heard our infant cries, And folded us with fond embrace, And when we woke, our infant eyes Were open'd on a mother's face. Our wishes she did make her own, Her bosom fed and pillow'd too, Answering each start or fitful moan With trembling pulses fond and true. Then knowledge was a thing untaught, Heaven's charity, a daily dole, Stole in inaudibly, and wrought Its gentle bonds about the soul. Eftsoons our ripen'd age is thrown Abroad with things and many men, Perchance to mock, perchance to groan, To cower or trample, proud or mean. Perchance to view each opening morn, The beggar, Memory, lean and pale, Still asking alms of Hope, forlorn, Hoary and sad, and bow'd with bale. Palms line the Llano's dreary waste, See Humboldt. And sunset rims the saddest moor; But all our joy is gone and past, Our hopes can face our fears no more. They ne'er return upon the track Their absence has consign'd to gloom, Nor usher with sweet promise back Delicious peace, and health and bloom. But oh! if spirits pure as thine Through life might be for ever near, There would be scantier chance that mine Would sink beneath the doom I fear! [We all must die—but to the good] We all must die—but to the good Celestial bliss succeeds the tomb, The darkest vista in the wood May open into scenes of bloom. And where is scene so sweet, so fair, As heaven beyond the grave expanding? How many, Lord, shall anchor there, And feel th' extatic bliss of landing? O! might I be of that blest throng! Design'd to laud and hymn and kneel In rapture of adoring song, And all a Seraph's lofty zeal! Might I with nearer view inspect The dread Unknown, the King of Kings, And grasp with angel-intellect Thy Nature, O thou Life of things! THE END.</field>
