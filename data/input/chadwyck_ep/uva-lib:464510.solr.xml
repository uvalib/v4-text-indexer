STANZAIC LIFE OF CHRIST [Prologue.] Ihesu, Ã¾at born was of a may In amendement of mankynde, Deyde and rose the thridde day The deuelus bond to vnbynde, He ?eue me grace sumwhat to say To botene hem Ã¾at ben to blynde Here lyfe to rule in good aray, Thorwe lore Ã¾at I in Ã¾is boke fynde. A worthy wyght wylned at me Sertayn Ã¾yngus for to showe, Ãat in Latyn wrytun saw he, In Englissh tonge, for to knowe Of Ihesu Cristes Natiuite And his werkus on a rowe, To the whiche by good Auctorite He myghte triste &amp; fully knowe. There-fore now ys my by-gynnynge Atte Cristes incarnacioun, And myne Aucteres fully rehersynge, On the whiche I founde my lessoun. Ther-fore Ã¾at redeÃ¾ here wyth-ynne, Rewarde Ã¾e mater of euery resoun, And trewe wyttenesse, as haue I wynne, Writen he shal fynde redy boun, So Ã¾at no fable, in good fay, Ãat fals ys, shal he fynde non, But thyng Ã¾at trewe ys &amp; verray, And wyttenesse names wryten Ã¾ere-on. By-fore euery mater, and I may, The Auctor shal, by my bone That Clerkus shal not after say Ã¾ese newe fables wrote a fonne. Petrus in Historiis Scolasticis de incarnacione Christi. We reden of two and fourty ?ere Of Octouian Ã¾e Emperoure, The on and thretty, wyth-outen were, That kyng Heroud toke his honoure, Of Olympyas, ys to lere, Thre hundred Nynty and thre, Ã¾at floure Conceyued was of a mayde clere, Ihesu Crist our Saueoure. The syxt monethe, take hit in mynde, After Ã¾at I[ohn conceyued was, Vp-on a Fryday, as y fynde, To vs be-felle Ã¾at blisfull case. The viij kalende of Auerille And of Ã¾e mone Ã¾e x day, ffor to wayue Ã¾e deuelus wylle And wrechednesse to put a-way, Of Na?areth in Galile Of a mayde Ã¾at hete Marye Conceyued Crist was, leue ?e me, Mankynde of bale for to bye. Ãys endud was, nys no lesynge, Ãe f[yf]te elde, declare wol I, ffrom the wordles by-gynnynge, As ?e shulle hire ful sone in hy. ffrom the wordles by-gynnyng, with-oute were, Til Ã¾at Crist lyght in-to oure kynde V. Ã¾ousand &amp; two hundred ?ere Were fully passed, as I fynde, Saue iiij. were wantyng wytterly, As oure auctores beren wyttenesse, And v. eldes Ã¾is tyme fynde I, As after I shal declare expresse. Vp-on a Friday oure lady Conceyued Crist with al mekenesse ffor on a Friday, bi trewe story, Adam both wro?t &amp; wayuet wesse. That selue day &amp; hour also That Adam banysht was fro blis of Paradise to worldes wo, that selue hour, wit ?e wel i-wys, the thefe that henget on a tre biside Crist quen he vs boght, to Paradise, as ?ernet he, with angels blisfullie was broght. De sex etatibus seculi. Nota. Now of Ã¾es eldes speke we er that we meue our first mater, And quat Olimpias may be declare also I wol now her. The first elde was from Adam to Noe flode, as fynde we, the secunde fro Noe to Abraham, the thridde to Dauid, leue ?e me. The furthe elde was from Dauid kyng to peple of Israel home wer broght ffrom Babilony to hor owen wonyng, that venkyscht wer both sold &amp; boght. The fifte elde was from Ã¾is comyng til God for monkynde bote soght And light into a virgyn ?yng ffor monnus hele, as he bi[t]hoght. The sixt elde &amp; Ã¾e last of alle, of quych Ã¾e ende vnknowen is, that we ben in, I may wel calle, til worldes ende no thing amys. And in Ã¾is sext elde &amp; Ã¾e laste come Criste mon-kynde of car to keuer, And peple Ã¾at bifore wer paste to bryng to blis Ã¾at lastes euer. And ri?t so as this world I-wys ffro bigynnyng to endyng In sex eldes diuiset is, Mon is that has his fulle lyuyng. ffor the first eld, bout wer, Infancia. of mon Ã¾at is in flesch her lent, lastes into Ã¾e seuent ?er, that qvile he is calde innocent. ffro seuen ?er into fourtene Puericia. is secunde elde, soth to say, that childhede cald is, bout wene, And tho?t has non but gomen &amp; play. The thrid eld is from fourtene to e?t &amp; twenti ?er I-wys, Adolescencia. that growyng time, with-out wene, proprelie cald with clercus is. In Ã¾at elde, as is wel sene, is mon moost in his iolite, And to lighschip enclyne &amp; kene, As mon may al day sothlie se. The ferth elde is ?outh calt, Iuuentus. ffrom e?t &amp; twenti to fifty, In quich elde Ã¾ou lif shalt by wit &amp; strength most studfastlie. The fift elde of our lyuyng is calde time of soburnesse, Grauitas. in quich eld mon is enclynyng to fayntship &amp; gret feblenesse, And this elde is enduryng ffrom fifty to sexty &amp; ten, ?if sadship euer in hym shal bryng, hym bihoues to haue it then. The sext elde &amp; last of all Senectus. is fro Ã¾at to his lyues ende, of quich no certeinte may fall, but wayte quen he shal hethen wende, And right as day of iugement is vnknowen in gode fay, so is this elde verrayment to mon, quen he shal passe away. Now sex eldes ar rekenet her ffrom worldes bygynnyng to ende, And other sex eldes in fere of mon til that he hethen wende. Of Olimpyas speke we nowe And declar quat Ã¾at may be, qvy date was sett by hit &amp; howe, sone expreslie ?e shul se. Qualiter connotacio Olimpiadis fuerat introducta. In Grees we reden a hul Ã¾er is that passes Ã¾e clovdes fer of heght, Olimpus callet it is Iwis, to lyf on hit wil serue no sleght. but philosophers, as rede we opon Ã¾at hul sumtime went the cours of sterres forto se, but long my?t Ã¾ai not Ã¾er be lent, For moyste air was Ã¾er noon, As monnus kynde wold wiln to haue, but spounges Ã¾ai token hom ichon ful of water hor lif to saue. And so til thai auiset wer of Ã¾e planetes &amp; hor meuyng, with sich sleghtes til thay wer Ã¾er thai comen to conquer that conyng. Vnder that hul sum time Ã¾er wasse vset a ful solempne play of iustyng, tournament &amp; oÃ¾er solas vche fifte ?er in gode fay, In worship of a god I-wys, that thay mensket thurgh hor my?t, the quich was callide Iouys, that er hade ben a worthy kny?t. ffor that time was vset this, qvo-so couth rule hom in hor ri?t And conquer most worldlie blis, as God Ã¾ai worshipt sich a wi?t, And in honour of Ã¾at kyng, the quich as God so worshipt was, vche fifte ?er, bout lettyng, that gomen was vset in Ã¾at plas. ffor hade thay vset continuely vche ?er so that real play, dyspense wold haue don hom any, the costages wer so grete &amp; gay, And ?if Ã¾ai haden differret hit to lenger time then fife ?er, ffor?eten wold haf ben in hor witt. tha[t] play with kyng kny?t &amp; swier, And in Ã¾air play sich laghe Ã¾er was, that qvo-ser wan Ã¾e victory, quat ?ift he wilnet in Ã¾at plas was grauntide hym Ã¾er fullily. So was Ã¾at play iche fift ?or continuet ay assiduely, til Ã¾at Mary Ihesu bere And hor date toke thay Ã¾erby, As we done, Ã¾at be now lyuyng, of Cristes incarnacioun, or ellis of our lord Ã¾e kyng, As vset is in vch toun. Therefore I sett atte bygynnyng, that men verrayly know moun hou Ã¾ai datide Ã¾at time hor thing er Crist in erthe light adoun. Now let we be Ã¾is ilk mater And to our first turne we a?ayn, of Crist &amp; of his moder der speke we Ã¾at wil more do gayn. Lucas in euangelio suo quod sic incipit: Exurgens Maria abiit in montana When Crist was li?t in our lady, ho roos &amp; went from Na?areth to the cite of ?acharie, And gret hir nece Eli?abethâ the quich cite is four mile Dionisius. ffrom Ierusalem, as rede we. ther ho dwellide a grete qvile, thre monythes fullie, leue ?e me, Ministryng hir syb wommon Eli?abeth, til ho light was of Cristes forgoer sayn Ioon, In qvom al godenes was &amp; gras. Lucas in textu. Qven Eli?abeth &amp; Mary To-geder metten, leue ?e me, Mary gret hir mekely, And quen Eli?abeth hir con se, The childe stiride in hir body, ffor ioy of Crist Ã¾er hoppet he. then bigan to prophecy Eli?abeth, as here moun ?e, ffor with Ã¾e holy gost in hy Eli?abeth fulfillet was, And with a grete voys &amp; cry to hir ho spekes in Ã¾at plas: Blesside be Ã¾ou, modir Mary, Imong alle wymmen ful of grace, And Ã¾e fruyte of thi body that thou now conceyuet hace. âA swete God, hou may Ã¾is be? A special grace is me bitid, that Goddus moder thus comus to me with Crist al in hir body hyd. âAnon as Ã¾i voys, lady fre, Quen Ã¾ou come ner stroke in myn er, the child her Ã¾at is inwith me enioiet gretlie Crist to her. âAnd blesset art Ã¾ou Ã¾at leuet so As Ã¾e angel to Ã¾e tolde, ffor wordes Ã¾at he spake, Mary, tho shyn be fulfillide, be Ã¾ou bold.â Then bigan moder Mary Canticum Marie matris. A song of blis Crist to welcum: âMagnificat,â was hir melody, âAnima mea dominum. Et exultauit spiritus. âAnd my gost wel gladet was In God my help &amp; al my hele, ffor gret meknes sene he has In his wench, is not to concele. âTherfore iche generacioun Quia respexit. shal blesse me for-euer-more, ffor monkynde saluacioun by me to come he ordeynt ?ore. âAnd mich has that lord don for me, Quia fecit. that prince is &amp; of most power, his nome euer-more halowet be In heuen &amp; eke in erth her.

Sicut locutus. âAnd to our faders he bihy?t, Abraham &amp; his sede also. blesside be that Lord of my?t And honour to hym for-euer &amp; oo!â ffinitur canticum. After that Mary con thus heer heuen kyng in hir entent, thre monythes after ho lenget ther, And with Eli?abeth ho was lent, til Ion Ã¾e baptist was i-bore, And then to Ioseph home ho went, but then was Ioseph greuet sore, fforsake Marie he hade I-ment. [Nativity.] Matheus in euangelio: Cum esset desponsata mater Ihesu. When he segh ho with child was, then hade Ioseph in hert any, supposyng in hir gret tresspas, And tho?t to leue hir pryuely. Then God send doun an aungel has to Ioseph slepyng sikerly, And comfortide hym in that caas of his wif maiden Marie, And saide that child was not by mon, but geten thur?e Ã¾e Holy Gost, then leuet Ioseph Ã¾er-opon, And thonket God of my?tes most. Lucas: Exiit edictu. This time was sent a maundement ffrom Octouian Ã¾e emperour that al the world, als he hade ment, shuld writen be, both toun &amp; tour. Petrus comestor in historiis scolasticis capitulo xxxiij?. The emperour coueitet forto knowe the nomes of reumes redily thurgh-out Ã¾e world al on a rowe of quich Rome hade ful maistry. ffor that time al Ã¾e world I-wys tributarie to Rome was. therfore Ã¾e emperour in his blis wold haue writen iche place, Prouince, shir, &amp; eke cite, how mony thur?e the world Ã¾er wer, and iche hede, als leue ?e me, that shulden tribute to hym bere. He comaundet eke also that all men in ich cuntray to Ã¾e chef cite shulden go, And a peny Ã¾er to pay. of siluer shuld Ã¾at peny be, ten comune penys hit was worthy, And on hit writen was, leue ?e me, hor knowlachyng apertely, And by Ã¾at peny bounden wer thay fforto be obedient to Ã¾e emperour of Rome for ay, be that ?yft with gode entent. Lucas: Vnde ascendit Ioseph a Nazareth in Bethleem. Then for Ioseph comen was of kyng Dauid by lynee, from Na?areth his way he mas to Bethleem his chef cite, fforto knowlech in that cas that to Rome buxum was he, and with hym Marie his wif he tas, for bihynde hym mi?t ho not be, Sithen Ã¾at ho was with child tho, with Goddes sone to saue monkynde, bout hir thider wold he not go, And in Ã¾at plite leue hir bihynde, Eutropius in cronicis suis. but sett hir on an asse onon. And an ox with hym toke he to selle &amp; to lif Ã¾eropon quyl Ã¾ai duellide in that cite, And also tribute forto pay of that he shuld take for that best, for simple &amp; pore both wer thay, ffor God wold li?t Ã¾er pride wer lest. Qven Ã¾ei to Bethleem comen wer, As frer Bertilmewe beris witnes, Sum of Ã¾e peple made gode cher, And sum mournyng &amp; tristes. But quat it signifiet, thurgh praier of blesset Marie, expovnet it wes to hir thur?e an angel cler, as I shal showe ?ou her expres. The folk, he saide, that wer likyng, Wer sich as hopide after hele, And of hor bale to hafe botenyng thur?e Abraham, nys not to concele, And thurgh Ã¾e sede of hym con spryng, to wyn agayn Ã¾at worthlie wele that Adam lost from his ofspryng, As God he?t bifore ?eris fele, And al-thagh Ã¾ai ne knewen no?t that God come Ã¾er so hastylie, ?ett likyng stroke into hor tho?t At comyng of Crist kyndely. the peple that so mournyng was, were Iewes that shuld descriet be and repreuet for hor trespas, that hor saluacioun couth not se. ffor then sceptre bigan to cees from iche braunche of Iudas kynde, for verray prince to wyn vs pes was comen al of Ã¾at self strynde. this word Ã¾en fulfillid was that Iacob saide in prophecie; that sceptre from his son Iudas shuld neuer be raft kyndom to gye, til he wer comen Ã¾at shuld be sent ffro heuen to erth mon to forbye, And after hym with trewe entent the peple shulde wait &amp; ?orne aspie. Genesis vltimo: Non auferetur sceptrum de Iuda &amp; dux de femore eius, donec veniat qui mittendus est, &amp; ipse erit expectacio gencium. Quen Ã¾at Ioseph &amp; Marie to Bethleem thus comen wer, ffor thai wer pore &amp; al nedie, herber my?t thai non com ner fforto leng in honestly, ffor taken was ich hous &amp; maner to lordes &amp; men that wer my?ty, That non my?t thay get Ã¾er ne her. But a hous woghles Ã¾er was, that sett was negh Ã¾e he?e-way, bitwene two houses hylyng it has, but side al opone, soth to say, In quich hous men of that cite haden hor speche in wederes wete, vplondisch men Ã¾er, als rede we, ther setten hor horses in Ã¾at strete, Therfore a crach Ã¾er maket was for esement to toun comyng. And thider Ioseph in Ã¾at cas Mary &amp; bestis both con bryng, And to Ã¾e crach both ox &amp; asse he te?et, &amp; so wer Ã¾er lengyng, and Ã¾at ni?t in Ã¾at simple plas ber Marie Crist our heuen kyng. Hec in Historiis Scolasticis. Qven Ihesu born was, be ?e bold, Marie maiden Ã¾at hym ber was nobot fourtene ?er old, the emperour two &amp; fourty ?er Of his regnyng, as I er told, the e?t kalende of Ianuer And on a Sononday our Lord wold be born, as he was bout wer. But one thyng now is gode to showe. As I shal tell apertely, quat time Ã¾at ?e moun fully knowe Crist was born of maiden Mary. This ?e shal vnderstonde I-wys, that bifore Ã¾at Crist was born, the ny?t was taken not amys after Ã¾e day &amp; no?t biforn, But after Ã¾at Ihesu Crist born was, the ny?t has ay ben set bifore, ffor ny?t to day turnet he has, that mon bicome to saue our sore, Thesternes in-to gret li?t, longyng into gret likyng. therfore I may say by ri?t, And therof make no lesyng, That on a Sononday at ny?t born was Ihesu heuen kyng, ffor ny?t bifore Ã¾e day was py?t that time &amp; Ã¾en so bigynnyng. De mirabilibus contingentibus in die natali domini &amp; circa illud tempus in diuersis mundi partibus. ffrater Bartholomeus in sua compilacione de infancia Christi. When Ioseph comen was &amp; Mary At ny?t into Ã¾at simple place, al-Ã¾a?e Ioseph wist witerly that Marie Crist conceyuet has, neuer-Ã¾e-later he went in hie, for he segh ne?e hir time it was, and two maidens wonyng bie he bro?t to help hir in Ã¾at cas. That one of hom hi?t Salome, that oÃ¾er Tebel, soth to say, that al ny?t lenget, leue ?e me, with our lady til hit was day. Tebel by signe sothlie con se that Mary was a clene may, affermet &amp; saide, âhow may Ã¾is be? a maiden has born a child to-day.â That oÃ¾er saide hit was not so, hou mi?t Ã¾at be for any thyng? Tebel was in hir purpos thro, saide it was soth &amp; no lesyng. Quen Ã¾at Salome se?e Ã¾is, ho tho?t be sle?t ho wold assay, and temptide forto do amys our lady Marie Ã¾er ho lay. But sone hir hondes flesch &amp; bone ffor that ilk presumpcioune drieden vp, &amp; Ã¾at onon for veniaunce, as ?e leue moun, ffor felyng of hom clene was gone, til an angel li?t adoun, that counseilet hir to leue opon, &amp; mercy aske with deuocioun. Anon as ho asket mercy And touchide Ihesu that born was, hole ho was onon in hie and thonket God of al his grace. Aliud mirabile. Martinus in cronicis suis de mirabilibus Rome. Sumtime in Rome made Ã¾er was a temple of ful grete richesse, temple of pes that ilk plas was callide, as writen is expresse, Al of gold &amp; of perre, thrid part Ã¾e world hit was worthy, of quich ?et sumquat men may se, but negh dar non com for any. But Ã¾at temple, leue ?e me, was sett al ful of mavmetry, of iche londe &amp; eke cuntre hor god stode Ã¾er apertely. Vchone hade writen on his brest his nome, the londes name also, A belle of siluer of Ã¾e best the image ber of alle tho. Imyddes that temple was stondyng the god of Rome ful rialy, As grattest god &amp; most chef kyng of al Ã¾at oÃ¾er company. A-boue Ã¾at temple al with-out A hors-mon stode al made of bras, A sper in his honde wonder stout turnyng about Ã¾at image was. ?if any lond wold do any to Rome with bost or with bataile, or comyng by conspiracy that ilke cite to assaile, The image of Ã¾at lond in hy rong his belle with-out faile, And turnet his bak ful deignously to god of Rome, hom to auaile. And that hors-mon made of bras A-buf Ã¾e temple turnet his sper toward Ã¾at lond Ã¾at risyng was Agaynus Rome bataile to rere. Qven prestes Ã¾at wer Ã¾er dwellyng sich tokenyng forto aspye, segh Ã¾os ymages hom turnyng, to Ã¾e souerayns Ã¾ai con hye, And tolden quat lond was risyng the empir of Rome to any. thai senden onon bout tarying legiouns Ã¾at londe to destrie, Or ellis to kepe hom in comyng And so to sle hom sodeynly, thus Ã¾ai conqueret kemp &amp; kyng And al Ã¾e world als witerly. Now wil I telle, ?e know moun, quat a legion is to say, An ost it is to bataile boun of certeyn noumber, nys no nay, Sex thousande men of gret renoun, six hundreth sixty &amp; sex in fay was callide Ã¾at time a legioun of kny?tes kyd in gode aray. In Ã¾at temple was fuyre ay cler, that slek my?t no wordly wy?t with wynde water ne no mater that monnus witt imagyn my?t. But of this temple, bout wer, he Ã¾at wro?t hit asket was how long &amp; als hou mony ?er hit shuld endur so in Ã¾at place. And he onswaret &amp; told expres, hit shuld endur, leue Ã¾eropon, til a virgyn wemmles had born a childe bout help of mon. Qven men of Rome herden Ã¾is, thay leuet soth as prophecy hit shuld endur, nothyng omys, with-out ende Ã¾er witerly, And writen ri?t in Ã¾e entre of that temple al bifore, that temple &amp; fuyr shuld lastyng be In Ã¾at place for euer-more. Hec verba scripta erant in lingua latina: Templum pacis eternum. Neuer-Ã¾e-later al fel doun quen Crist was born of Our Lady, temple &amp; images, ?e leue moun, And fuyr als slekket sikerly Opon ?ole-day with-outen drede, as after wist was oponly, thus was Ã¾e deul al in his dede deceyuet thurgh Goddus mercy. Aliud mirabile. Orosius &amp; Innocencius papa iij? Another wonder fel Ã¾at day, As both Oras &amp; Innocent beren witnes in gode fay, As I to telle now am in-tent. A walle of water by Rome Ã¾er was, that al Ã¾at day fro morne to ny?t was turnet to oile &amp; wallet vp has oile hastily in mennus si?t. Ouerthwert Tiber, Ã¾e water of Rome, hit ran a streme al day ful strong, of that walle Ã¾at thethen come thurgh-out Ã¾e water his way con fong. So Sibille propheciet bifore, that oile out of Ã¾e erth shuld spryng quen Goddes son shuld be Ibore, As soth was founden &amp; no lesyng. That day was seen als sikerly thre sonnes on Ã¾e firmament, that afterward ful wonderly Into one substaunce al Ã¾ai went. Quich sight may wel signifye thre thyngus, as I shal now say her, saule, flesch, godhede, as leue I, that Ã¾en wer gederet alle in fer, And thre persouns als spiritualy, I vnderstonde in gode maner, to one substaunce wenten in hy, that verray God was, bout wer. Aliud mirabile. Innocencius papa iij?. de gestis Romanorum. Octouian Ã¾e emperour hade made Ã¾e world suget to Rome And mich amendet toun &amp; tour, And rightwys duke was in his dome. Of alle kyndoms conquerour, sich a kny?t neuer Ã¾ider come, therfore Ã¾ai tho?t hym to honour As god, sich counseil alle Ã¾ai nome. But the emperour was wys And tho?t wel that he was dedly, sich honour shuld no?t be hys, after Sibille he sent in hye, And asket qveÃ¾er Ã¾at euer shuld be Any mon born in flesch &amp; blode so gret a lord as then was he, so gracious &amp; eke so gode. Then Sibille asket a time to pray, then wolde ho gyf vnsuar Ã¾erto. so Crist was born Ã¾e thridde day, And to Ã¾e emperour come ho, And showide hym a wonder si?t, A sercle obuf Ã¾e sonne was And in Ã¾e sonne a swete wi?t, A maiden clene al ful of gras, A child hade in hir armes clyght, A voice from heuen sone herde was: âher is Goddes auter dight, As thou may se bifore Ã¾i fas.â Verba Angeli: hec est ara dei celi. Then saide Sibille to Ã¾e kyng: âthis ilk child Ã¾ou ses now her shal pas Ã¾e in alle thing, of strength, wisdom &amp; power.â The emperour honouret then knelyng that child &amp; to hym made praiere, and with encens als vp-steyng, comaundet also both fer &amp; nere That alle men shuld do hym honour, ffor that child was best worthy, And so forso[k]e the emperour Godhede to take vnworthily. And in Ã¾at plas, Ã¾er-as he stode quen he segh Ã¾is selly si?t, was made a chirch after ful gode of Mary maiden ful of my?t. And forto haue fulle memorie of sight Ã¾e emperour ther segh, And of Ã¾e angels melody that he herde in heuen on hegh, That ilke chirch now calde is Sancta Maria, as hyt wel may, in ara celi, no thing omys, ffor so the angel song Ã¾at day. Aliud mirabile. Martinus in cronicis suis. He that made Rome, as rede I, Romulus Ã¾en he?t he, sumtime raiset realy his image vp in Ã¾at cite. How he shuld hause thing so heuy bout heuenly help, as then did he, wonder hit was gret witerly and qvi I say sone ?e shun se. ffor hit was herre fiftene feete then Ã¾e heghest plas in Rome, Alle men honouret, I ?ou heete, that image that biside hit come. Opon a hegh piler stode hit of ston al hole with-out twynnyng, that wondir hit was to monnus witt quat craft raiset so heuy a thyng. As gold hit shone both ny?t &amp; day, And with Ã¾e sunne hit was meuyng, the image his face hit turnet ay towarde the sunne on hit shynyng, In Ã¾e ri?t honde in gode aray A rounde sercle forth-shewyng, In Ã¾e lift honde stout &amp; gay A long sworde in honde manassyng. That sercle tokenet, as rede I, that al Ã¾e world was holly his, And to Rome shuld be ay redy that hede &amp; souerayn cite is. The sworde tokenet truly that Rome shuld manas Ã¾at did mys, And wer wel &amp; worthily that thay hade wonen bifore I-wys. When Romulus hade sett hit there, he saide hit shuld neuer falle doun til a wench that maiden wer to ber a childe wer redy boun. But Ã¾at selue day I-wys that Crist was born of our lady, As he saide, felle doun al this, so was fulfillede his prophecy. Aliud mirabile. Eutropius. Also quen that Crist was born, the ox &amp; asse doun knelyng honouret God Ã¾er hom biforn, And haden in hor kynde fulle knowyng That hor creatour was Ã¾er, wonder is then but men of witt shulden bysy be his birth to her, sithen boystouse bestis honouret hit. ?et wer miracles mony mo showet in diuerse place, As I shal showe ?ou er I go After this pagyn a littel space. But now of clerkis wys tretys touchyng Cristes natiuite Speke of now is myn auys, And as thay sayn now ?e shul se. Notandum quod natiuitas Christi fuit mirabiliter facta, multipliciter ostensa, &amp; vtiliter exhibita, sicut inferius declarabitur. Now gode is Ã¾at ?e knowe &amp; se, As I shal louely ?ou ler, that Ihesu Cristes natiuite was done in meruelous maner, Showet als-so, as ?e shul se, mony waies to vs her, And for gret profit, leue ?e me, Mon he bicome in meke maner. Primo fuit mirabiliter facta ex parte generacionis. touchyng hym that engendret has, God hym-self thurgh Ã¾e holi gost, to monnus witte wonder hit was that he that was of mi?tes most Wold light into so pore a place, saue only of his gret godenes, ffor his Godhede so grauntyng grace he disparaget then expres. Vnde Apostolus: seipsum exinaniuit formam serui accipiens. As touching als his moder fre and the maner of hir gendryng, vnlike it was, by my leute, to alle bifore &amp; after comyng, ffor maiden ho was euer-more bifore that birth &amp; after suyng, As I may preue was saide bifore In Ã¾is boke quich I wil myng. ffor by fyue signes shawede hit was that maiden ho was, moder Mary; ffirst wittnes, as boke mynde mas, the gret prophete Isay: Primo per prophetam: Ecce virgo concipiet &amp; pariet filium. âSe,â he sais, âconceyue shal wel A maiden &amp; ber a child of blis, his nome clepide Emanuel, that tokenes, âGod with vsâ, I-wys.â Emanuel, id est, nobiscum deus. Secundo per figuram. The secunde maner showet is thas ho was virgine clene &amp; cler, In figur &amp; tokenyng I-wis by Aaron ?erd, as con aper, ffor, as we reden fer bifore, In Moises time hym lyuyng, Aarons ?erde, Ã¾at drie was thore, fflorischt Ã¾at time in tokenyng That Goddes sone wold be I-bore of a maiden, as I now myng, to releue Ã¾at wer forlore, And monkynde to blis to bryng. Item dicitur in E?echiel: vidi portam in domo domini clausam, et dixit angelo: Porta hec non aperietur, set clausa erit &amp; vir non transiet per eam, quia dominus solus intrabit &amp; egredietur per eam. Also Ã¾e prophete E?echiel se?e a ?ate in heuen on hegh, closet hit was swith wel, that ?ate Ã¾er come nomon negh. ther told an aungel Ã¾e prophet Ã¾o, that ?ate shuld not oponet be, ffor thurgh God wold come &amp; go, non oÃ¾er ther shuld haue entre. That tokenet Marie &amp; nomo, ho was Ã¾at ?ate, leue ?e me, ffor bi hit God con com &amp; go, As Ã¾e prophete in gost con se. Tercio per custodiam. Als showet hit was Ã¾e thrid way, that maiden ho was euer-more, for to Ioseph to kepe hir ay weddet ho was onely Ã¾erfore, that he mi?t kepe hir couenably &amp; witnes ber al of hir dede, As he by si?t knewe sikerly And angels warnyng, as I rede. Quarto. the furth euidence verrayment that we witen ho maiden was, was by expresse experiment the mydwif preuet in Ã¾at plas. ffor, as I told bifore now her, two mydwyues wer with hir al ny?t, Ã¾at one wold preue ?if hit so wer that ho wer maiden by full insight, And quen ho towchet priue plas, hir honde drieden vp onone. and als hou Ihesu born Ã¾er was ny in what maner wist not one, ffor clos womb conceyuet he was And clos womb als out he went, this preues hir maiden ful of gras by expresse experiment. Quinto. The fift sadship of knowyng that Mary maiden was euermore wer mony miracles then showyng, As I haue told now her bifore, Of temples, images doun fallyng, As told was er his birth full ?ore by hom Ã¾at maden sich knowyng A thousande ?er er Crist was bore. Secundo natiuitas Christi fuit mirabiliter facta ex parte geniti. The secund poynt I spak of her, that Ihesu Cristes natiuite was done in merueilous maner towchyng hym-self, as ?e shun se, that wonderly engenderet was, neuer non sithen ne bifore In Ã¾at maner, as mynde mas saynt Bernard in his likyng lore. Bernardus: Eternum, Antiquum &amp; nouum mirabiliter conuenerunt, Eternum, id est diuinitas, Antiquum, id est caro ab Adam traducta, Nouum, id est anima de nouo creata. Bernard beris gode witnes that thre merueils fellen in fer quen that Ihesu Crist born was, that mich merueil is to her. Eternum. Thing that neuer hade bigynnyng ny neuer-more shal endyt be with old thyng &amp; newe enioynyng to-geder comen alle thre. Antiquum &amp; nouum. Qvat Ã¾is to say, expoun wol I, I pray ?ou takes hede to hit, ffor thester hit is witerly but I declare hit to our witt. Exponit Eternum. Euer-lestyng thing bout bigynnyng verray Godhede calle I may, that mynget was to our likyng with olde thing, as I shal say. Exponit Antiquum. Old thing is that flesch &amp; blode that taken was of a maiden kynde, so menget was for monnes gode that mater with Godhede, as I fynde. The thrid thyng may callide be Exponit nouum. A new soule, then newe wro?t I-wys, so clene was neuer non, leue ?e me, ny neuer more shal be after Ã¾is. And thus euerlestyng old &amp; newe to-geder comen quen Crist was born, And so monkynde new merueyl knewe that neuer was knowen Ã¾er-byforn. Coniuncta sunt ad inuicem deus &amp; homo, mater &amp; virgo, fides cor humanum. Her may mon se to-geder knytt God &amp; mon, moder &amp; may, and also, wonder to monnus witt, ffleschly hert &amp; verray fay, fful mi?t &amp; gret feblenes, ffilth &amp; fayrnes knyt in fer, ffor fairer Ã¾enn God neuer thing wes, ne fouler Ã¾e mon is no mater. Wonderful it was also that a may conceyue mi?t, moder &amp; maiden both two, And lengyng maiden day &amp; ny?t. Was neuer Ã¾at wonder sene bifore, that God disparaget so shuld be, therfore merueil is Ã¾e more he wold so meke hym, leue ?e me. Tercio natiuitas Christi fuit mirabiliter facta ex modo generandi. The thrid poynt i-touchid her, that his birth merueilous was touchyng hym, with-outen wer, thas Ã¾is maner engenderet has. ffor his birth was agaynus kynde, Contra naturam. a virgyn to conceyue a wy?t, agaynus resoun, als [I] fynde, Contra rationem. fflesch to conceyue God almi?t, Agaynus vsage of wommon, Contra consuetudinem. Bout pyne to ber, I merueil most, the furth thing that I wonder on, to conceyue thur?e Ã¾e Holi Gost. de spiritu sancto. ffour maner God made mon I-wis, As seynt Austyn makes mynde. the first maner that was tys Primo sine homine &amp; femina vt Adam. er that engendryng was or kynde, As Adam made was of Ã¾e clay And ?yuen gost &amp; lif also. the secund maner, as I say, De homine sine femina vt Eua. As Eue was made onon ri?t tho, ffor of Ã¾e mon taken ho was quyl that he lay Ã¾er slepyng, that kyndly luf &amp; eke solas shuld be bitwene hom her lyuyng. The thrid maner is kyndly De femina &amp; homine vt consuetudinis vsus. And comune vsage al day sene, of mon &amp; wommon witerly, As alle men engenderet bene. The ferth makyng is, as this day, of wommon comyng bout mon, De femina sine viro vt Christus. As Crist was born &amp; God verray, that most is forto merueil on. Nota quod natiuitas Christi fuit multipliciter ostensa, vt patet infra per creaturas ipsam cognoscentes. The secunde principal poynt is tys, that showide was his natiuite In mony maner, nothing amys, As ?e shyn her now of me. Ostensa est natiuitas Christi per omnes genera communes creaturarum. Showet it was forsoth i-wys by creatures of iche degre, that both gostly &amp; worldly is, As ?e shal ful sone se. Quedam creatura habet tantum esse, sicut pure corporea. Sum creatur has beyng wyth-out vertu any more, As ston &amp; erth &amp; sich thing, that neuer hade lyuyng her bifore. Quedam habet esse &amp; viuere, sicut vegetabilia. Sum creatures han beyng, that lif han but felyng none, As trees, erbes on erth groyng moun nother speke ne fele ne gon. Quedam habet esse, viuere &amp; sentire, sicut animalia. Sum han beyng, lif also, and felyng als, as bestes han, saue monnus wit has non of tho, saue fle for fert lest thay be tan. Quedam habet esse, viuere, sentire &amp; disc[erne]re verum, vt homo. Sum han beyng, lif by kynde, ffelyng &amp; discrecioun, As mon has, takes this in mynde, As I declar wil by resoun. Sum han felyng, lif, beyng, discrecioun, vertus mony moo And gostly vnderstondyng, As angels han &amp; non oÃ¾er so. By all Ã¾es creatures, as Ã¾is day, Ihesu Cristes natiuite was showet, as I shal sone say, by diuerse miracles, leue ?e me. Primo per creaturam que tantum habet esse. As to Ã¾e creatures, in gode fay, that beyng han, as erth &amp; ston, that Ã¾ai knew Goddus com verray Preue I may &amp; Ã¾at onon. And Ã¾at was showet apertly by temples &amp; images fallyng doun In Rome, as her bifore saide I, And als mony an-other toun. And als, sich creatures witerly knewen God at his passioun, ffor stones cleueden wonderly, At his deth as men rede moun. Als we reden, long bifore In Ã¾e Olde Testament the prophete Ieremie told ful ?ore In-to Egipt quen he went That quen a maiden a child hade bore, hor maumetry that Ã¾er was lent shuld falle doun both las &amp; more, As fel this time verrayment. ffor, as we reden in story, quen Mary flagh to Egypt londe, then was fulfild Ã¾at prophecy that I to specify now wol fonde. Ecce dominus ascendet super nubem leuem, &amp; ingredietur Egiptum, &amp; corruent simulacra Egipti a facie domini exercituum. âSe,â sais Ã¾e prophete, âGod shal stegh opon a li?t cloude &amp; a bry?t And entre into Egypt hegh merueiles to meue with mayn &amp; my?t. âAnd quen he comus al mavmetry Shun be mouet, tas this in mynde, ffor hym quen he wil thider hy that is verray kyng of kynde.â And as Ã¾e prophete saide i-wys, quen Ihesu entret Egypt inne, hor mavmetry Ã¾en ferd amys And fellen doun as haue I wy[nne]. But quen Ã¾e prophet Ieremye hade propheciet hit shuld so be, Men of Egypt wenten in hie And maden an image, leue ?e me, A maiden in arme a child beryng, And in hor temple setten hitt, And Ã¾at ilk ymage old &amp; ?yng honouret hit with al hor witt. Also Ã¾at ny?t Ã¾at Crist born wes, ffirst it was ri?t a thester ny?t, but at his birth ful gret bry?tnes And thesternes so turnet to ly?t. In Rome als, as bifore saide I, A walle sprong oil al Ã¾at day, so I may preue scilfully Al dede thing knewen hor god verray. Heuenly creatures eke also that han beyng &amp; no lyuyng, As sonne &amp; mone both two And sterres in Ã¾e lift schynyng, knewen God quen he was born, for about Ã¾e sunne was sene A cercle, as I tolde biforne, A maiden Ã¾er-in, bout wene, Thre sunnes opon Ã¾e firmament, A sterre, was neuer non so cler, that to Ã¾e kynges Ã¾er Ã¾ai wer lent In maidenus liknes con aper. Thus heuenly creatures, as say I, that dede wer knewen his comyng, And erthlie also, in gode fay, that neuer hade gost ne lyuyng. Secundo ostensa est natiuitas Christi per creaturam que habet esse &amp; viuere, sicut plante &amp; arbores. The secunde maner, as I say, Cristes birth wel knowen was with Ã¾at creatur, in gode fay, that beyng &amp; lif only has, As trees, herbes &amp; sich thing, that lif han, but felyng non, lif by greneschyp &amp; growyng, but nouther to fele, speke ne gon. And that Ã¾ai knewen hor God verray, shewide hit was apertly, ffor vynes of Engade al Ã¾at day walleden out bavme continuely, fflorischiden, beren fruyt in fay, quen Crist was borne al sodaynly, that men Ã¾er wonyng mony a day wonderet, I shal say ?ou qvy. ffor thre thinges agaynus kynde shewide Ã¾at day expressely, that wonder is to haue in mynde, saue only Goddus grete mercy. The first, Ã¾at trees Ã¾at time of ?er or erbe ouÃ¾er shuld leuet be, ffor mony a vyne Ã¾er fruyt ber, that wonder si?t it was to se. Another wonder als was her, that bavme come out of Ã¾e vyne tre, saue only God wold hit so wer, In signe of his natiuite. The thrid wonder hit was tys, thay sprongen wer so sodeynly, ffor las Ã¾en in an hour i-wys thay burionut &amp; leuet apertly, And beren fruyt eke also. thus knew Ã¾at creatur God almy?t that beyng &amp; lif hade both two, but nouther felyng, wit ne si?t. Tercio per creaturam que habet esse, viuere, &amp; sentire, vt animalia bruia. Tho thrid maner as I er tolde, his birth was shawed to old &amp; ?yng by creatures, as hym-self wold, that haden beyng, lif &amp; felyng, As wilde bestis han i-wys, the quich, I may wel preue &amp; say, Goddes birth nothing amys was knowen &amp; showide as tys day. ffor as I saide bifore now here, the ox and Ã¾e as Ã¾at Ã¾er wer lent, quen Ã¾at Mary Ihesu ber, honouret hym in hor entent, Knelyng doun, as beris wittnes Eusebius in his boke oright, As fast as Crist Ã¾er born wes, ri?t in Ioseph &amp; Mary si?t. Eusebius says eke also, A littel bifore Ã¾at Crist was born, Plogh-men erit in a feld tho, the exen speken hom biforn, Homines deficient segetes proficient. And saiden Ã¾at folk shuld faile i-wis, And cornes shulden encres oryght, bi quich I vnderstonde wel this that I shal say ?ou sone in hi?t. The folke Ã¾at Ã¾ai saide shulden faile my?ten wel be Iewes wyterly, ffor to hom ordeynt was trauaile At Cristes come be prophecy, As I saide a littel byfore that Iacob told at his deth-day Iewes blode shuld last euer-more til Cristes come put hit away, Non auferetur sceptrum de Iudac &amp;c. Therfore Ã¾e exen in Ã¾e plogh saiden Ã¾at mon shuld faile in fay, And qvy corn shuld do gode i-nogh declare I wil her more verray. I fynde Ã¾is writen in boke i-wys Nota. And knowen also is ?et Ã¾is day with trauailet men Ã¾at han sene Ã¾is, the quych I shal ful sone say, That fro Ã¾at time Crist suffret payn And deghet opo Ã¾e rode tre, Iewes haden neuer my?t ne mayn to norisch corn in no cuntre, And als sithen Ã¾ei disperpoilet wer ffrom thethen into diuerse place, thai my?t neuer raise in no maner corn Ã¾er Iewes wonyng wace, So that a mon may sothly se that of Ã¾es exen prophecy was fulfilled, as thinkes me, afterward ful fullily. Quarto per creaturam que habet esse, viuere, sentire &amp; discernere, vt homo. The furth maner, in gode fay, shewide was his natiuite by creatur Ã¾at haue may ffour prerogatiues, ?e shun se, that is to wit, forsoth i-wys, beyng, lyuyng &amp; felyng, discrecioun also Ã¾e furth is; that nas non oÃ¾er erthly thing Saue only mon Ã¾at has Ã¾es all, the quich knew his birth, as say I, no creatur, so fair me falle, saue angel knew so verrayly. ffor to mon profit most hit my?t, therfore hit semet he shuld knowe Cristes come by verray sight And signe, as I shal fully showe. ffor first mon knewe by prophecy that Crist wold come into our kynde, And quen he comen was in hy, signes showen, as I fynde, Right as I haue tolde bifore, to emperour, to kynges thre, that seghen thing was told ful ?ore And tokenynges quen Ã¾at comen was he. And the emperour made onon that he segh knowen in Ã¾at cite, the kynges to Crist as Ã¾ai conen gon, als maden hit opun, leue ?e me. So that to mon, with-outen drede, showide hit was most opunly, And mon forth showide hit, as was nede, to conferme olde prophecy. Quinto per creaturam, que habet esse, viuere, sentire, discernere &amp; intelligere, vt Angeli. Now wil I telle Ã¾e fift maner how Cristes birth was made aperte by heuenly creatur to vs her, both in house &amp; in deserte, The quich creatur has beyng, lif, felyng &amp; discrecioun And gostly vnderstondyng more then all bifore moun, And tho ben angels verrayment, ffor thay moun knowe Ã¾at nomon may, how thay knew God omnipotent, In mony maners I shal say. ffirst quen he was born onon, the sheperdes wakyng, rede we, An angel come &amp; bad hom gone to Bethleem Ihesu forto se. And quen Ã¾at angel pronouncide hade Ihesu Cristes natiuite, other of his birth conen glade And songen with gret solemnite, Melody mich noumbre made, As gospelle witnes, leue ?e me, of sich song shuld neuer mon sade, And quat Ã¾ai songen ?e shun se. ffacta est cum eo multitudo celestis exercitus laudancium deum &amp; dicentium: Gloria in excelsis deo &amp;c. To Octouian eke also An angel speke apertely, qven Ã¾at Sibille showet hym tho the sterre, as her bifore saide I, And also to Ã¾e kynges thre An angel come at hor praier And bad hom go into Iudee, ther born was Crist with-outen wer. Mony an-oÃ¾er time also As we reden in story, Angels comen to mony mo his birth Ã¾at time to certify. Tractatus Bernardi de natiuitate domini. Saynt Bernard spekes witerly And saide thre myschefs monkynde hade, er God of vs wold haue mercy And mediacioun mekely made, In birth, in lif, in deth also, ffor birth was ay in wruchidnes, the lif in trauaile &amp; gret wo ffro bodily deth to hell expresse. But Ã¾en Crist at his comyng agayn thre poyntes of any monkynde of bale forto bryng ordeynt thre poyntes of remedy. ffor born he was of a wommon, And lifde thre &amp; thrytty ?er, de?et also Ã¾e rode opon, so fullide he thes thre poyntus her. His birth clanside oures tho, his lif enfourmet vs in Ã¾e fay, his deth destriet the deul our fo And wan vs lif Ã¾at lastes ay. Austyn sais also wel this, that our first faders pryde with meknes of Crist i-wys was helet, nys not forto hyde. ffor Adamus pride agayn God was And to hym come &amp; herre Ã¾en he, As I declar wol in Ã¾is plas, that thes moun stonde wel all thre. Agaynus God hit was i-wys, quen mon so wro?t agayn his wille, of that tre to ete amys that was defendet hym to com tille. to God come also his trespas, for godhede to haue wilnet he to trist Ã¾e deul al in that cas, that heght hom Goddes forto be. Dixit serpens: Eritis sicut dii. herre Ã¾enn God he wilnet also, In-als-mich as was his power, to coueit thyng defendet hym tho, And that he my?t noway come ner. Crist meket hym then agayn Ã¾es thre In burth, lyuyng &amp; deth also, ffor mon was Adam, mon was he, but godhede with Ã¾at wayuet our wo. De circumcisione domini nostri Ihesu Christi. Now speke sumquat I wil her of Cristes circumcisioun, qvi hit was don Ã¾at ?e moun her that listen now to my lessoun. Thre skilles I fynde in gode fay wherfore Ã¾is fest shuld honouret be, the first for hit is eght day of Ihesu Cristes natiuite, The secunde eke, ?e knowe may, Is gyuyng of nome, leue ?e me, the thrid blode-shedyng, soth to say, that for mon-kynde first shed he. As to Ã¾e first, I may wel preue, sithen seyntes festes honouret ben Aght days to-geder, his forto leue vnskilful si?t hit wer to sene; Sithen Ã¾at he is most of my?t And of alle seyntes hede &amp; souerayn, to reuerence his day hit is ryght And mensk hit most with al our mayn. The secunde skil is sikerly qvy we honouren Ã¾is day, for nomet he was witerly, As Goddes mouth bifore con say. Hodie impositum est ei nomen, quod os domini nominauit. Bernarde witnes, as rede I, thre nomus he hade, Ã¾at nys no nay, Goddis sone one is sikerly, Crist &amp; Ihesus, Ã¾es thre in fay. Distinctio nominum, Et primo quare dicitur filius dei. Goddes son he callide is In Ã¾at he come from heuen doun And mynget godhed no?t amys with monhede, as ?e leue moun. ffor from Ã¾e faders maieste out of hym-self he doun was sent, therfore he may wel callide be Goddes son omnipotent. And al-thagh in one trinite thre persouns ben to-geder lent, Ã¾e goddhede is with alle thre enterlie, takes in ?our entent. De secundo nomine, quare dicitur Christus. Crist callid he is als, bout lesyng, that is to say, with crem anoynt, ffor prophet, champion, prest &amp; keng I may wel preue hym by Ã¾is poynt. In olde time Ã¾e vsage was thes four persouns anoynt to be, And preue I may al in Ã¾is plas that alle Ã¾es four offices has he. ffor prophet he was truwe &amp; verray, As preues Ã¾e holi euangely, for er he de?et Ã¾e sext day, thes wordes he saide in prophecy: Non relinquetur in te lapis super lapidem. Quen he come to that cite Ierusalem Ã¾er he was dede, remyng on hit Ã¾er saide he thes wordes with a ruful rede, That destruyet hit shuld be, As bifelle after fifty ?er, for folk Ã¾er wonyng couth not se hor God comyng hom so ner. Of this mater, leue ?e me, her-after I shal say more cler In his passioun, that alle ?e moun witt hit was so bout wer. Quod dicitur pugil. And for his du?ty dede doyng, champioun call hym als I may, the deul our enmy ouer-comyng, thurgh deth he de?et on Gode Friday, ffor our forme-fader &amp; his of-spryng he raft the deul in gode aray, therfore as champioun wel fe?tyng Anoynt hym fel to be in fay. Quod dicitur sacerdos. Prest also in recounselyng his peple Ã¾at was put away to langour out of gret likyng, hom he releuet as prest verray, And to his fadir agayn con bryng hor saules, that lorn wer, soth to say. As verray prest thur?e his prechyng to Ã¾e ioy Ã¾at lastes ay. Quod dicitur rex. Kyng also I may hym calle, ffor ?iftes Ã¾at he ?af largely to alle that to Ã¾e faith wold falle And mekly ask of hym mercy, Blynde hor si?t, deue heryng, mesel men &amp; out of mynde, halt &amp; croket, to haue knowyng that he was verray kyng of kynde, To dede he gaf gost &amp; lyuyng. harde it wer one sich to fynde, kemp or cayse[r], clerk or kyng, one sich bonde forto vnbynde. Syn alle kynges Ã¾at euer wer my?t not ?if one of alle tho, I may preue that his power passes alle oÃ¾er Ã¾at can do so. Quare dicitur Ihesus. The thridde nome Ihesus it is that hym was ?yuen Ã¾is ilk day, And bifore also i-wys, As I shal ful sone say. Ihesus is as mich to mene As saueour of all mon-kynde, declar it I wil more clene In thre maners, as I fynde. ffirst saueour he may callide be, ffor he to saue hade ful power, sythen godhede, monhede, leue ?e me, In his persoun wer both in fer. ffor deede suyng also is he saueour callide skylfully her, As ?e shun more clerly se ?if ?e wil listen &amp; of me ler. Hoc nomen impositum est ei ab eterno. In-als-mich as he callide is saueour for mi?t Ã¾at he has, hit semus Ã¾is nome was gyuen i-wys to hym er world bygynnyng was. ffor as sayn Ion berys witnes, bigynnyng his euangely, As I in Latyn her expresse Apertly thenke to specifye: In principio erat verbum &amp;c. He sais Ã¾at at te bygynnyng Goddes sone, Ã¾at is saueour, was with God in hym beyng, And he God als in full honour. De imposicione nominis per angelum. Also at his doun-comyng from heuen to erth forto be mon, he callide was saueour &amp; kyng, And how I wil telle, as I con. Gabriel Mary gretyng bad hir do Ã¾at ho leuet on, And call hym Ihesus at hir beryng, then secunde time his nome bigon. De imposicione nominis per Mariam &amp; Ioseph. The thrid time, quen he was borne, Ihesu callide he was i-wys of Mary, as ho knewe biforn of Gabriel nothing amys. And that nome ?yuen was as Ã¾is day when Ã¾at he circumciset was, ri?t as at fologht now in fay childer ar nomet in ich plas. Quod dicitur saluator in actu. ffor his dede salueour eke also callide he is ful skilfully, for bot his dede hade holpen tho, no?t hade auailet his maistry. Quat serues mon, now takes hede, A vertu ?yuen to worch with-al? but he wil profre hit forth in dede, that vertu serues of ful smal. Therfore fully to fulfille that God ordeynet at bygynnyng, Mary, as was Goddes wille, gaf hym Ã¾at nome at hir beryng. In fulle significacioun that with Ã¾at flesch saue vs wold he, that he toke with deuocioun of Mary forto make vs fre. So that preue wel we moun by thes ilke skilles thre, Ihesus was ?yuen hym by resoun to nome er made was stone or tre. And eft quen he conceyuet was Mary was beden by Gabriel to calle hym Ihesu ful of gras, As ho did, nys not to concele. The thrid time that nome he has, As this day ?yuen hym for our hele, As Luke in his boke mynde mas, to wayue our wo &amp; wyn vs wele. Now sithen that God at bygynnyng this nome gaf to his sone by ryght, After by Gabriels gretyng quen that Crist in our lady light, The thrid time in confermyng the worde Ã¾at ?ore God hym bihy?t, this nome Ihesu, to my thinkyng, shuld vertuose be and mi[ch] of my?t. Tercio de sanguinis effusione. The thrid poynt was blode-shedyng, that he for vs shed as this day, to showe Ã¾er-by a bygynnyng that shede hit ofte he was in way. Quod quinque vicibus sanguinem suum pro nobis fudit. ffyue sith I fynde his blode he shed ffor vs, as I shal sone say. the first was this day quen he bled In crach &amp; childhode as he lay, A gode bigynnyng Ã¾er he mas to forbie vs with his bl, ffor old la?e that thenne vset was ffulfille he wold, Ã¾at frelie fode. The secunde time that blode shed he was bifore that he was tane with Iewes, as wel reden we, when his gret passioun bigan, ffor quen he hade made mavnde with his disciples euerychone, Into a ?erde Ã¾en went he And alle Ã¾ai, as witnes sayn Ion, And Ã¾er he praiet in gret tristesse, that blody swote from hym ran doun, In-as-mich as he mon wes, for drede of his gret passioun. Lucas in euangelio: Et factus est sudor eius, velut gutte sanguinis decurrentis in terram. And that blode-shedyng sikerly was for desir Ã¾at he hade tho Monnus saule forto forby, And wyn Ã¾at wer in sorow &amp; wo. The thrid time he shed his blode was quen he scourget was i-wys to make tho Ã¾at wer gylty gode, worthily &amp; no?t amys. The furth time of his passioun, quen he was nailet to Ã¾e tre, ther was Ã¾e prys for vs laide doun that he fulfild to make vs fre. The fift time als, in gode fay, that he bled for monnus dede, was quen Ã¾at he on Gode Friday on croys his hert-blode con shede, And that blode-shedyng verrayment, when his hert so percide was, is callide Ã¾e holi sacrament that bro?t vs fully to his gras. Blode &amp; water witerly out of his hert he shed Ã¾at day, blode monkynde to forby, And water our syn to wassh away. And Ã¾at water may signifye that thurgh fulloght, in gode fay, Adam syn Ã¾at did vs nye with water is slekket, soth to say. Thus turnet is Ã¾e sacrament circumcisioun vset ?ore to fulloght, sithen Ã¾at Crist vs kent In signe Ã¾at we wer thral bifore Thur?e syn, tille God his son had sent to wasch all Ã¾at vnworthy wore with water Ã¾at from his hert went, then circumcisioun last nomore, But fulloght vset in tokenyng that, ri?t as Crist shed water cler, so with water at our comyng he wold Ã¾at we so washen wer. Quare circumcisio data fuerat. Now ?e shyn wit Ã¾e cause qvy Circumcisioun ?yuen was, takes hede al Ã¾is company, hit may do gode ?if ?e haue gras. ffor mony causes Ã¾at sacrament to Abraham first ?yuen was, As God hym-self wel to hym kent, he did first nothing amys. One cause, as clercus sayn verrayment, Imong oÃ¾er may wel be Ã¾is, sithen Adam was inobedient And thurgh hit lost Ã¾at grete blys, Abraham, Ã¾at obedient was to God fully in alle thing, shuld plese hym &amp; gete his gras to fulfille wel his biddyng. ffor sad bileue eke also that Abraham hade in Goddes hest, quen he a son biheght hym tho, the lif of quych shuld ay lest Til Crist come to keuer mon-kynde, and that Crist born be of his blode the deules bonde forto vnbynde and turne monkynde to mich gode, By quich barn shuld blesside be Alle naciouns, Ã¾at nys no nay,â ffor Abraham leuet Ã¾is, der was he to God al after his lif-day. Alia causa quare circumcisio data fuit. AnoÃ¾er cause assignet is qvy circumcisioun ordeynt was, to know Ã¾at folk fully for his ffrom peple of alle oÃ¾er plas. In Ã¾at stid of Ã¾e flesch also God bede Ã¾at sacrament don shuld be, for God wold mon shuld suffre wo ther-as temptacioun most hade he, And als for Adams grete offens, quen he trespast to God almy?t by so grete inobedience his biddyng no?t to do oright In that membre, leue ?e me, he felide first temptacioun quen he hade eten of that tre thurgh Ã¾e deul &amp; his tresoun, Therfore thagh mon so pynet be In Ã¾at membre, hit is resoun, sithen in Ã¾at membre first knewe he syn &amp; Ã¾erto sone was boun. ffor sithen Adam vnbuxum was And did agaynus Goddes wille, Abraham ful of buxumnesse ffor his defaut most nede fulfille Al maner poyntes of meknes Goddes wrath so forto stille, And in Ã¾at plas ber signe expres that first greuet hit forto grille. Quare circumcisio fuit octauo die petrino cultro. The sacrament don was Ã¾e aght day. And also with a swaret stone, ffor in Ã¾e aght eld, in gode fay, shyn rise fro deth to lyue ichone. And then thur?e Crist Ã¾at callide is A stone in bokes of holy writt, Al syn Ã¾at mon has don amys that stone Crist away shuld kytt, And make alle sauet men so clene that Ã¾er com no corrupcioun, then may that callid be, as I mene, the secounde circumcisioun. But takes hede now I ?ou pray one certayn poynt til I declare, Ã¾at I speke of bifore in fay, And ?et Ã¾at speche nyl I not spar. Quod sex sunt etates seculi, septima morientium, octaua resurgentium. Sex eldis I fynd in world Ã¾er wer Nota. and Ã¾er nemmet I no mo, And in Ã¾is skyl Ã¾at I saide her to hom I te?et oÃ¾er two, Of qvich two deth is Ã¾at one. that oÃ¾er general risyng, In qviche elde we euerychone shyn come bifore Ã¾at heghest kyng, Ihesu Crist, Ã¾at callet ys a stone, &amp; circumciset be, that is to wit forsoth i-wys, be hym clanset alle be we Of that we han done her amys, And thurgh penaunce made wel his gre, but tho that wold no?t be hys to pyne euer-lestyng, leue ?e me. Alia causa quare circumcisio fiebat octaua die. Raby Moyses. AnoÃ¾er skil I wil now say, As raby Moyses beris witnes, qver-fore ay the eghtide day circumcisioun ?yuen wes. ffor the child als tender is Aght days after hit is born As in Ã¾e moder wombe i-wys, quen hit was Ã¾er-in biforn, And then encreces more &amp; more In strength &amp; stifnes day for day, [Go]d ordeynt penaunce wel Ã¾er-fore hym forto suffre in gode fay. De epiphania. Epiphania dicitur ab epi, quod est supra, &amp; phanos, apparicio, quia tunc desursum stella apparuit siue ipse Christus per stellam. Now speke we of Ã¾e Epiphany, that lewet men callen Ã¾e twelf day, how hit was ordeynt &amp; for-qvy, diuerse skilles I wil now say. ffor four myracles wel I fynde this holi fest mich honoures is, that I wil myn to haue in mynde that ?e moun honour hit not amys; As this day thre kynges of kynde worshipeden Crist forsoth i-wys, baptiset he was als to vnbynde our bale &amp; bryng vs into blys, Water he turnet into wyn In a toun in Galile, that was bro?t to architryclyne fforto assay Ã¾erof &amp; se, ffyue thousande men in wildernes with fyue looues of barly-brede And two fisches Ã¾at he couth bles he fed, &amp; ?et twelfe lepis lede Of relif Ã¾at Ã¾er laft wes, thus sauet he hom Ã¾ai wer not dede, And to Ã¾at peple shewide expres verray signe of his godhede. Nota tempus in quo facta sunt Now wil I telle apertly her quat time ich miracle so don was, And specifye in quich ?er, er I in mater firre pas. In Bethleem qven Mary hym ber, the thritten day, nomore ne las, honouret with kynges he was her lying bitwene an ox &amp; as. After Ã¾at nene &amp; twenti ?er In the thritty bigynnyng, the thritten day, with-out wer, bapti?et was Ihesu heuen kyng, Erat enim incipiens quasi annorum triginta, vt dicit Lucas. In flem Iordan Ã¾is ilk day, And on hym li?t Ã¾e Holi Gost And faders voice als herd in fay from heuen blis Ã¾er he is most. So that I may sothly say this day Ã¾e holi Trinite shewide hym hole as God verray, And eke also in persouns thre. ffor quen he spak from heuen blis And saide, âmy louede son is her,â the faders voys was herde i-wys And so by speche he con aper, The son also in flesch &amp; blode, that bapti?et was in water cler, Aperide Ã¾er for monnus gode verray God &amp; mon in fer, the holi Gost on hym con light In liknes of a dovue i-wis, thus shewide hym verray God almy?t In thre persons Ã¾at on God is. Et ob hoc vocatur hoc festum theophania, a theos, quod est deus, &amp; phanos, apparicio, quia tunc deus trinitas apparuit, Pater in voce, filius in carne, spiritus sanctus in columbe specie. On a Sonday was don Ã¾is dede, Nota. And Monday suying bigan he his fourty days fastyng, In boke as sothly rede we, And fiftene kalende of March mone he endet his fasteng, in gode fay, so to desert was lad ful sone And temptide with Sathan, soth to say. Tercium miraculum, de Aqua in vinum conuersa. The next ?er after Ã¾is suyng, this selue day, as leue ?e me, Wyne wontide at a weddyng in a toun of Galile, And thurgh his moders mynnyng water to wyne Ã¾er turnet he, this is Ã¾e thrid cause bout lesyng qvy that Ã¾is day thus honour we. Et ob hoc vocatur Bethfania, A beth, quod est domus, quia in vero miraculo facto in domo verus deus apparuit. Quartum miraculum, de quinque milibus hominum satisfactis in deserto. This ilk selue day also next ?er after Ã¾en suyng, God fed fyue thousand men &amp; mo In desert with littel thing, With loues fyue &amp; fisches two, As I saide at bygynnyng, Ihesu was olde of ?eris tho two &amp; thretty bout lesyng. Et ob hoc vocatur hoc festum phagephagya A phage, quod est bucca siue manducare. Quare magi Ierusalem venerunt ad honorandum Christum. Iohannes Crisostomus. Now go we to our first matere And of Ã¾es kynges speke we And cause original ?e moun her qvy Ã¾ai comen into Iude, To honour Crist Ã¾at Mary ber, the certeyn cause her ?e shyn se, to make our wittes more cler, And leue Ã¾at hit so wel my?t be. We reden in a boke i-wys of Ã¾e Olde Testament that Numeri wel callide is, the furth of Bible verrayment, A clerk ful coynt Ã¾er was wonyng In Moabs londe, that cald was Balaam, Ã¾at in a coniuryng of deules ful mich power has. That ilk? tyme Iewes wer Goddes peple and most of prys and to hym no folk? half so der. whil thay did wel and wold be wys, And trespasset in the lawe no thing, but diden al as his wille was, vche nacioun hom nyyng to ouercom thay haden grace. So wonet ther negh a nacion that Moabites callet wer, of whiche Balaac bar coroun, and keng was, as ?e sone schun her. This kyng and al his reme al-so pursueden Goddes peple ay, but euer hom tid the more wo and wer ouer-comen night and day. The kyng segh this grete meschef that his peple haden al-way, and thotht to do the Iewes gref, an-other medicyn to assay. After Balaam sone he sent with dukes for [to] com hym to, thurgh hym he hopet to be kent in that cas what was best to do. Thenne al that lond had be-leue what-ser he blesset blesset was, and what he cursut hyt wold cleue, And thurgh cursing went grace. Then Balaam so was after sent to curse the peple of Israel, he sayd he durst not verrayment but God ?af leue with hom [to] dele. So conseilet he with God almyght that leue he had Ã¾e ner to go, but for to wary no maner wyght ny by no way to do hom wo. So as he went to-ward the kyng with dukes that for hym wer sent, for gret ?iftis and fair hetyng sone he had turnet his entent, And kest as sone as he come ther to wary Goddes folk anone, but sone [an] aungel con hym fer to-ward Ã¾e kyng as he con go one. For in an narow way i-wys the aungel mette hym, as rede I, and calenget Ã¾at he thoght amys wyt drawen sword ful cruely. But wen the aungel was commyng, the asse Ã¾at Balaam rode opon set ffete on spar, hym withdrawyng to honour the aungel as he con. But Balaam had ?et no grace the holy aungel forto see, and why his asse so stondyng was wonderle thyenne merueilet he, And smot hys asse whit al his mayne, and spak to hir fast ther stondyng, and Ã¾e asse spak fast a?aynne, and vnswaret hym to al thyng. But thenne God of hys myche myght to se the aungel ?af hym grace, when Balaam of hym had a sight, felle doun anone by-fore his face. Ther of the aungel sone in hight repreuet truely he was, and sayde to sle hym he had tight, nyf the asse had ?iuen hym place. Ther had he leue forthe for to go, but to curse hom on no maner. to the king when he come tho, he wolcomet hym with louesom cher, In-to a hul anone thay went, and ther the keng taght in hy wher that Godde[s] folk wer lent and schowet wonyng by and by. âLoâ, says the keng, âher thow may se thys folk? that dos vs miche wo, curse hom Balaam, I pray the, and make hor God to be hor foo. âAnd I schal ?iue ?ow gold and fee enogh of richesse er thow go, ?if that thow wolt do after me, destruye the Iewes Ã¾at ben so thro.â Balaam seuen auters sett And vset his craft sone in hie, the kyng mich gode hym bihett, ?if he my?t do hom any anye. But quen he warie shuld hom alle, he praiset hom &amp; blesside euer in one. the kyng segh Ã¾er hit wold not falle, to anoÃ¾er side Ã¾ai conen gone, And seuen auters as bifore he made sett in anoÃ¾er place, but Ã¾er my?t Balaam do no more then he did Ã¾er-as he er was, But ay praiset in all thyng Goddes peple Ã¾er Ã¾ai wer, And blesside hom &amp; hor wonyng, ffor Ã¾ai to God wer leue &amp; dere. Qven Ã¾e kyng twie se?e this cas, wode wroth he was witerly, but ?et into anoÃ¾er place with Balaam sone he con hy, And setten vp auters sone onon, but al hor dede mi?t no?t auaile, so four sithe Ã¾ai euerychone of hor purpose foule con faile. But quen thay hade assaiet thrie, the furth time thur?e Goddus gras Balaam spak in prophecy thes wordes writon her in Ã¾is plas: Orietur stella ex Iacob, &amp; exurget homo de Israel &amp; confringet omnes duces alienigenorum &amp; erit omnis terra possessio eius. Quen kyng Balaak se?e Ã¾is cas that Balaam propheciet oryght, he wist wele Ã¾at no bote was forto stryue with God al-my?t, But sone remewes from that plas kyng &amp; clerk, knaue &amp; knyght, And cecede after of her manas Agaynus Goddus folk to fight. After Ã¾is ful mony a ?er quen that Balaam was dede, men of his blode &amp; to hym der wold no?t mynde of this wer lede, But chesen hom twelue men of his blode, the quych wer ordeynt iche ?er continuelie with myld mode forto make hor praier Ich mone to God al-my?t, that he wold graunt hom of his gras of that sterre to haue a si?t that Balaam propheciet of has. And iche moneth ones thay went In-to a hul that callide was Mount Victorial verrayment, to make hor praier in that plas. And so continueden hor praier fro Moyses time euer-more, child after child two thousande ?er bifore that Ihesu Crist was bore, And casuelie thes kynges thre that weren of Balaams blode, quen Crist was born in Iude hor praiers maden with myld mode. And as thay praiet ay in fer As hor auncesters diden bifore, A sterre aperide wonder cler, so fair was neuer non sene ful ?ore, The quich shapen was like a childe, non fairer my?t be, And opon his hede he has A shynyng croys as thay conen se, that to the kynges apertly spak Ã¾es wordes Ã¾at I shal say: âgos into Iude sone in hy, ther Ã¾at ?e sechen ?e fynde may.â Then Ã¾ai purueyt hom anon forto seche that heuen kyng, and toward Iude fast Ã¾ai con gon with-outen any tarying. But wonder hit is, as clercus sayn, how thai come in so litel spas so mony myle for al hor mayn, In thritten days to Ã¾at plas. But, as Remyge berys recorde, sithen Ã¾ai so?ten God almy?t, No wonder tha?e sich a lord, thagh way wer long, made hit but li?t. Ierom also berys witnes dromedarys thay riden opon, that is a best of gret swiftnes a hundredth myle one day to gone. So riden thay til Ã¾ai come Ã¾er, And ay Ã¾e sterr lad hom Ã¾e way, sich hertis Ã¾ai haden hym to her that Ã¾ai stynt neuer ny?t ne day. Anone quen Ã¾ai comen wer to Ierusalem with gret meyne, thay enqverit in meke maner qver kyng of Iewes born shuld be. Vbi est, qui natus est rex Iudeorum? thay asket not qveÃ¾er it wer so, but qver hor verray kyng was born, ffor thai bileueden fully tho that born he was no?t long biforn. âWe se?en his sterre,â saiden Ã¾ai, âIn Ã¾e Est quen Ã¾at we wer, And comen hider we ben to-day to honour hym in meke maner.â By quych wordes in gode fay, As Remyge beris witnes her, two thinges vnderstonde I may, listnes now &amp; ?e moun her ffor thay enqueride in that cite After hor kyng was born Ã¾erby, that tokenes temperal dignite And worldly lordship witerly. And als Ã¾ai saiden, as ?e shul se, âcomen we ben in company to worship hym with hert fre, that god-hede wel may signifie.â So godhede, monhede both in fer In Ã¾es wordes I vnderstonde, Crist &amp; kyng in ful power ffrom heuen sent &amp; lord of londe. Herodes autem hoc Audiens turbatus est &amp; omnis Ierusalem. Kyng Heroude, quen he herde Ã¾is Ã¾ing, trovblide he was Ã¾en with tene, And all Ierusalem old &amp; ?eng stonyet wer, as was sene. Thre causes Heroude hade i-wys qvy he so gretly greuet was, the first of hom may wel be Ã¾is that I shal specifie in Ã¾is plas. Prima causa quare Herodes fuit iratus in adwentu magorum Ierusalem. For Heraude was an aliene And no?t born of Iewes blode, that from Rome, as wel was sene, sende to gouerne hom &amp; hor gode, Then dred Heraude lest born shuld be of Iewes kynde a verray kyng to reue hym al his rialte, that was Ã¾er but an out-comlyng. But ?et this poynt forto declar how that Herawde was Ã¾ider sent, And qvy for Crist he hade Ã¾at car, her I wil telle, now takes entent. In Ã¾e first boke writen is of Ã¾e Olde Testament, that is cald Genesys, the last chapiter verrayment, That Iacob twelue sone hade, to quych he told hor destyne bifore hor deth hom to glade, quat maner mon ichone shuld be. And imong other to Iudas he saide Ã¾es wordes that I shal say, that sceptre neuer from hym shuld pas, tyll Crist wer comen &amp; kyng verray. Genesis vltimo: Non auferetur sceptrum de Iuda &amp; dux de femore eius, donec veniat qui mittendus est, &amp; ipse erit expectacio gentium. And quen that kyng so comen wer, Crist Goddus sone to saue monkynde, of Iudas blode, in no maner any kyng saue Crist shulde nomon fynde. Of Ã¾is Iudas Iacob sone comen Iewes witerly, And of hym come Ã¾at nome in wone, In holy writt as wel rede I. So fel hit, ne?e er Crist was born, Ãat kyng of Iewes wer past out And al Ã¾e world to Rome sworn And thider wer buxum al about, So was Heroude Ã¾ider sent fro Rome to be kyng of Iude, that time Ã¾at Crist omnipotent was born of mylde Mary fre, And then, as I haue told bifore, quen Heroude herd that Crist was born supposet his kynde shuld regne nomore, but Iewes blode as was biforn, And lest Ã¾ai wolden haf put hym out And haue auauncet hor owen kynde, this was Heraudes gret dout, And one cause verray, as I fynde. Secunda causa quare Herodes timuit &amp; iratus fuit de aduentu Christi. AnoÃ¾er cause he dred hym fore my?t wel be Ã¾is that I shal say, for alle kynges las &amp; more thur?e-out Ã¾e world of ich cuntray Weren sent from Rome to vche londe, as Heroud was into Iude, ?if he had lafte that of his honde, schamele schent thenne had ben he. ffor Romaynes haden a statute maad, that noghwher God schuld callet be ne keng, but thay that leue hade of Rome and lordes of that cite. Therfore ?if he had suffert ther any keng boute hor assent, or callet God aboute oghwher in his lond ther he was lent, The Romaynes migh haue had a way Heroud schamely to haue schent, that made hym dredyng in gode fay, to destruye Crist more feruent. Tercia causa quare Herodes fuit iratus. The thridde cause whi he was wrothe schewes the gode sayn Gregory, ffor worldely keng most nede be lothe that heuenly keng schuld hym destruy. Heroud had fichet al his wit to worldly wele for sothe iwis, and lothe was to leue oght of hit or fleschely mirthes forto misse. But righ-wysly when heuenly keng come forto for-by so mon-kynde, the worldely keng most be dredyng and al amaset in his mynde. Gregorius: Altitudo terrena confunditur, cum celsitudo celestis aperitur. When Heroud segh these kenges thre so comen fer out of the Est, do hom reuerence nede most he, and callet his wisemen most and lest, and asket hom wher Crist born schuld be. thay sayden, âin Bethleem sikerlyâ. thenne prayet Heroud the kenges thre that thay schulden come a?ayn hym by. Quare magi ducatum stelle ammiserunt ingredientes Ierusalem. The fyrst for thei shuld streynet be to ask after qver he wer born, that kyng &amp; folk of Ã¾at cite mi?t know hor kyng Ã¾er hom biforn. And also Ã¾at Ã¾e kynges thre shulden knowe by hor prophecy In qvat place born shuld he be, As Heroudes clercus tolden in hy. And so the Iewes enfourmet wer the time of Crist &amp; his comyng, by Ã¾e kynges in this maner that certeyn tithinges couthen bryng, The Iewes also taghten enter the place qver shuld be born hor kyng, As thay by prophecy con ler of Mycheas, as I shal myng. Micheas iiij?? capitulo: Tu Bethleem terra Iuda, nequaquam minima es in principibus Iuda: ex te enim exiet dux, qui regat populum meum Israel. Secunda causa quare stellam amiserunt. The secunde cause may wel be Ã¾is, sithen thai worldly help Ã¾er soght, heuenly help Ã¾ai shuld mysse of sterre Ã¾at hom so thider bro?t. ffor til Ã¾ai come to Ã¾at cite of Ierusalem, as I ?ou say, Mony a myle &amp; eke cuntre enqueret Ã¾ai neuer after hor way, But Ã¾at sterr from heuen sent lad hom til Ã¾ai come Ã¾ere, And no time bifore fro hom went til Ã¾ai of men conen so enquer. Tercia causa quare ducatum stelle ammiserunt. The thrid cause, quen Ã¾ai comen wer ther-as was walle of prophecy, that thay by prophecy my?ten ler the time of his birth verrayly. ffor, as Ã¾e apostle beris witnes, signes verrayly shewede bene to sich as knowen not God expresse, that they moun leue thyng that Ã¾ai sene. But sich as knowen of his godenes, As Iewes that Goddes peple wer, prophecy to hom shewide wes to baue in mynde &amp; therby ler. The Iewes also witerly on mony prophetis leueden tho, but thos kynges, as rede I, on Balaam &amp; on no mo. Therfore hom nedet tokenyng Er that thay shuld thider go, As thay hade by the sterre shynyng And prophecy also both two. Qven thay from Heraude passide wer out of Ierusalem to Ã¾at cite, the sterre apertly con aper, glad wer then tho kynges thre, And alway lad hom as bifore til Ã¾ai comen to Ã¾at place, And ther stode stille, meuet no more, therby Ã¾ai wist that Crist born was. Qualis fuit stella que apparuit. Remigius. Now er that I firre go And meue more of Ã¾is mater, discreue Ã¾is sterre now I wil, so As diuerse auctores con me ler. Remige settes in his book mony doctours opinioun, as he in diuerse place con loke, and what thay ben now here ?e moun. Summe sayn this sterre that schone so bright the holy gost was weterly, for verray Crist in that light was sene, as her be-fore sayd I. for right as he schewet hym in sight in douue liknesse mekely, so in a sterres, als he wel might, in signe of his burthe openly. Opinio Iohannis Grisostomy de qualitate stelle. Iohan with the guylden mouthe says this, that ilke sterre an aungel was, the selue aungel forsoth i-wis that to the schephirdes schewde hym has, But to the schephirdes, sothe to say, in his owen liknesse come he, but to the kenges to lede hom way in sterre liknesse, leue ?e me. Verissima oppinio diuersorum de qualitate stelle. But most verray opinioun, as clerkes hopen thys may be, hit was new made, ?e leue moun, at Ihesu Cristes natiuite In knowyng he was comen doun forto make mon-kynde fre, And to fulful as was resoun this propheci, as ?e may se: Populus qui ambulabat in tenebris uidit lucem magnam. âPeple that was in thesternesse seghen grete light to hor likyng,â As Ysas beres gode wyttenesse, was now fulfullet in al thing. De situ, fulgore &amp; motu dicte stelle. Now ys good al that ?e knowe, the setting, schynyng and meuyng of this sterre I schal schowe, and as Fulgence witnesses this thing. âThat sterreâ, he says, âstode not on hight as other opon the firmament, but nerre the erthe hit was pight vn-like to other that ther wer lent. âffor in-myddes the ayr was hyt ful negh vs semyng as in sight, and wonder hyt was to monnes wyt in what place that hit was pight.â hit passet in schynyng also In fulgore. alle sterres Ã¾at euer wer sene before, for day and night also both two hit shone continuely euer-more, As wel quen sunne was shynyng As in ny?t quen hit was merke, that semus hit was a tokenyng of Cristes come, as sais Ã¾e clerke. In motu. In mouyng als vnlike it was to any oÃ¾er, leue ?e me, ffor euen into Ã¾e certeyn plas hit lad alway Ã¾e kynges thre, And meuet not in Ã¾at maner by cercle as oÃ¾er of Ã¾e firmament, but euen forth, with-outen wer, to wysse Ã¾e way bifore hom went. Et intrantes domum inuenerunt puerum &amp;c. Then entride thay the hous into And founden the child, his moder eke, hor ?iftes ho conen vnderfo, And honoureden hym with hert meke, With golde, encense &amp; myrr also. And qvy Ã¾ai chesen Ã¾es gyftes thre I wil telle er that I go, has mynde of this &amp; herkenes me. De misterio trium munerum, Primo de Auro. The first cause bout wer, for then was vset in hor londe, to God ny kyng in no maner shuld nomon come bout ?ift in honde. Secunda causa. Bernardus. Another cause may wel be this, As Bernarde beres gode witnes, that gold was offride not amys ffor Mary pore &amp; simple wes, And in releuyng of hir tho gold Ã¾ai maden in present, ffor al-thagh God wer born Ã¾er so, Pore Ã¾ai wer both verrayment. Then seghen Ã¾e kynges, as sais he, how porely Ã¾en Ã¾at Mary lay, And offriden gold ful gret plente to releue hir in better aray. Encense was offride als I-wys De incenso. stenche of stabul forto qvace, And myrre also nothyng amys for childes membres ?yuen was, To anoynt hom fote &amp; kne. for the kynde of myrre is this, hit strengthes, Ã¾at men may oft se, senowes &amp; ioyntes Ã¾at faren amys, And wormus wayues eke also, ffor myrre a gumme is, as I fynde, that al corupcioun puttis hym fro, And holdis thing clene in his kynde. Also in signe Ã¾at he was keng De Auro. gold rial power may signyfie, therfore thay token to hor offryng gold as for tribute skylfully. And als sithen he shuld bischop be de incenso. And hede of holi chirche also, encense was gode for that degre to sacrifise imong mo. Mirre also was ?yuen oright, De mirra. sithen he shuld degh &amp; buriet be, to bavme hym, al-tha?e he had ti?t to rise from deth in daies thre. Lo her ?e moun se wel in si?t De tribus muneribus. by gold a kynges realte, by encense als Goddes my?t, by myrre, deth that tholet he. Gold als luf may signifie, for it is ?yuen in no place but Ã¾er mon loues hertfully, As thay diden Ihesu ful of grace. Encense signifies eke deuocioun had to God al-my?t, that is done with hert meke to heuen hit steghes sone in hi?t. And myrre may signifie also ouercomyng of our fleschlie wille, quen we fe?ten a?ayn Ã¾at fo our talent no?t forto fulfille. And alle Ã¾es vertuse rekenet her offre we most to God almy?t, luf, deuocioun, flesch enter, ?if we wil lede our lif oright. And that in Crist wer alle thes thre, I wil preue skylfully, for siker for luf from heuen com he with his blode vs forto bye. disparagide so his deite. more luf to vs, but I shal lye, my?t he not showe, ?e may wel se, As Paule witnes apertely. Christus seipsum exinaniuit formam serui accipiens. deuoute saule he hade also that by encense may signifie, for quen he of Ã¾is world shuld go, for mon he praiet tenderly. Oro pro vobis patrem vt ipse vos custodiat. fflesche also he had enter and encorrupte of any synne, for of a mayden clene and cler borne he was our wel to wynne, And leuet two and thritte ?er And ?ette more, as I ?ow mynne, thenne after dethe withowton wer clarifiet from vs to twynne, So clene flesche he had al-way withouten any corupcioun, that I to mirre wel liken may that offert was by good resoun. When these worthy kenges thre haden mad thus hor present, in slepe an aungel, leue ?e me, warnet hom lest thay wer schent, Another way hor gate schuld be, for Heroud was in ful entent had he hom sene, slayn hom wold he, so home a-nother way thay went. So by a sterre thidder thay coom and Balaames prophecy, and hoom hor way thay noom by aungeles leding, as rede I. So thay lyueden gode lif ay, when thay wer dede weterly, at Melan a long while thay lay, the chefe cite of Lumbardy, After-ward translatet thay wer to Coloyne ther thay ?ette ben lent, and in one bed thay lyne in fer as weten thay that ther han went. De purificacione beate Ma?ri?e Hoc festum tribus nominibus solet appellari, videlicet Purificacio, ypopanti &amp; candelaria, sicut inferius declarabitur in lingua materna. Now of the purificacioun, that leude men calun condulmasse, speke we with deuocion And her whi that hit ordeynet was. Our lady Goddes moder der was purifyet, as rede we, the fourty day withouten wer after his natiuite. I fynde this fest thre nemes has, purificacioun that one is, presentacioun and condulmas ben other two forsothe iwys. Purificacioun nomet hit was, for our lady ful of blisse was purifiet, thagh by trespasse ho gulte neuer ny did amys. But for the maner thenne was so, ho most nede fulfulle the lawe as Moyses taght and vset tho, dredles ho most therto drawe. ffor Moyses lawe bad this expresse, ?if any wommon bar a sone, til faurty dayes comen was at home from temple ho schuld wone, But what wommon that doghter bere, doubul ho most botht tyme and day, as I schal sone declare now her the cause, er that I go away. Notantur tres cause quare dominus precepit vt quadragessimo die dei filius in materiale templum offertur, Et prima hec est. Thre causes I fynde, as ?e schun se, whi God ordenet the fourty day a knaue chyld forto offert be to the temple, as I schal ow say. The furst cause may wel be this, for in natures redun we that after a son conceyuet ys the fourty day ful schap has he and saule in-to hys body putte, therfore ordenet hyt is ay the wommon holly to be schutte of vnclannes the fourty day. Hec in Historiis Scolasticis. The secund cause fo[r]sotht i-wys ys thys Ã¾at I schal sone say, sithyne a gost that al clene is and wemmeles als by vch way, When hyt is putte to that body, as I haue sayd, the fourty day, that clene saule, as leue I, whit flesche is foulut in gode fay. Therfore hit his right gode resoun the fourty day ho clensut be, and childe als whit deuocioun to temple offert, thinges me, And so bi certeyne offryng make clene that furst fuylet was, and to temple hym to bring forto gete the more grace. The thryde cause is couenable that we schin wel vndur-stonde wel this, to heuenly temple we ben able to be offert to i-wys, ?yf we don welle for-euermore Goddes ten comondment? And four ewangelistes lore wihitouten defaute or any offensse. Quod in concipiendo feminam dies duplicatur. When wommon conceyuet hade A maiden child &amp; hit wer born, As Ã¾e lagh mynde made, thes daies doublide wer biforn, Both of fourmyng &amp; lif takyng, As natures maken fully mynde, til four score, nys no lyuyng, in maiden child by way of kynde. ffor in les daies Ã¾en four score A wommon fourmet ne saulet is, therfore Ã¾e moder so mich more most abide nothing amys fforto purifiet be, As Moyses la?e Ã¾en vset was, And so long time to haue entre Into Ã¾e temple thai hade no grace, Therfore sithen time of fourmyng of mon is er Ã¾en of wommon, And als of lif &amp; gost ?yuyng, by verray skil preue Ã¾is I con, That womman after a son beryng shal soner purifiet be, And spiritual skilles, as me gode think, I shal showe as ?e shyn se. Causa quare femina tardius formatur siue organi?atur in vtero matris quam masculus. Whi wommon latter fourmet is then mon, as I haue saide bifore, May wel &amp; skilfully be Ã¾is, that I haue lernet be gostly lore. ffor sythun Ã¾at God in wille was monhede to take as this in mynd, In masculyne gendre thurgh his grace, noght fourme in feminyne, as I fynde, God wold hit hade prerogatyfe &amp; more Ã¾enne womon honeret were, and sonner ?euen to gost and lyfe, &amp; moder purifiet bothe in fere. An-other skyl her shewe I may, Sithen woman dydde a more trespas, when mon was made Ã¾o sexte daye, as holy write ful mynde mase, Thurght the wommon, in gode faye, Ã¾o mon begylet fully was, therfore hir sorowe more thenne is aye God dowbult skylfully so hasse. And so he dowbulet hir leuyng in worde for all-waye wommonnes wo, so dowbulet he hir on lyf ?euyng in modres wombe bothe two, The enfourmyng more abydyng, and ?euyng of lyf eke also, and child als aftur burth to bryng to temple lengur tyme be fro. But Ã¾agh Ã¾o lawgh so Ã¾at tyme was a wommon purifiet to be Ã¾o faurten day of hir trespasse Ã¾at bare a sone, as here sayde we, Our laydy Ã¾at was ful of grace was neuer Ã¾o helder, leue wele me, Bonden to come in that place, for sedeles conceyuet was he. Nota quod Christus se voluit subdere legi propter tres raciones, &amp; prima est hec. Thre skylles wel I fynde why God wold bowe hym to the lawe, as I schal telle whil I haue mynde, ?yf ?e wuln herkun to my sawe. One skyl was Ã¾is, as klerkes sayne, to showe mekenys in all thyng, when he was born he wold be bayn ensaumpul of mekenysse be schoyng. For as Bede beres witnesse, hir nedet no purificacioun, ne Ihesu, Ã¾at was synnelesse, to haue tane circumcisioun, But for he wold in alle thing be like to mon saue in synne, to do Ã¾o lawe was his likyng in mony maner, as I schal mynne. Nam vt dicit Beda: In natiuitate se habuit vt pauper homo, in circumcisione vt pauper peccator homo, set hodie vt pauper, peccator &amp; seruus homo. For at his natiuite as a pore mon born he was, for pore was moder, leue ?e me, and born als in a pore place. And als at his circumcisioun as pore mon and sinful yke he shewode hym, as ?e leue moun, by ensaumpel to make vs meke. For Ã¾er-as hym nedet no thing of Ã¾at ilk sacrement that ordaynet was for a merkyng of sinful men, as I her kent, ?ette Ihesu Ã¾at synneles wasse wit Ã¾at merk wold merket [b]e in fulfylling before Iewes face Ã¾o lawe fully wit hert fre, As Ã¾is day also in gode fay, when he was offert Ã¾e tempel to As por mon, sinful, Ã¾e soth to saye, and thralle, as him thugh was to do. For wit him offert was Ã¾is daye A turture-brid and [p]ygones two, for por mennes offring Ã¾at was aye, but riche mon lomber and geet also. And Ã¾at he shewde h[y]m as thrall eke, I may wel preue &amp; lye right no?t, for wit two briddes as mon meke that offert were he [w]as for-boght. Also afture thritte ?ere he wold be folowet as he wes, noght for hym nedet hit boute wer, but for-to shewe alle rightwysnes. Nota quod quinque remedia contra originale peccatum ordinata sunt per processum temporis. Fyue remedyes, as I fynde, be processe of tyme ordeynet wer for Adames synne, tase Ã¾is in mynd, to pleise God wit and make mon dere. Primum remedium. Hugo de Sancto Victore. Hughe of saint Vittores i-wis beres witnesse of furst thre, that vset wer no thyng amysse At worldes beghynnyng to be. Whil men lyueden by way of kynde er any lawe ordeynet was, thre gode dedes, as I fynde, wer done to plese God ful of grace. Offeringes, tethynges, ther ben two, and sacrifise of bestaile thre, by whiche dedes thenne done so hit schowet for-boght that we schuld be. The furst remede was offryng, That be-gunnen was ful wel of Adames son, with-oute lesing, that one hat Caym, that other Abel. Cayme that a tilmon was, cornes offert not oright, Abel of bestaile offring mas, of furst-born to God almight. But Caymes offering in that place forsaken was in Goddes sight, for fuylet corn bifore his face he brand, ther-fore had thay no light. Abel, that good bestes took, had thonke of God for his doyng, but Caynes cornes God forsok, that of the worst made his offryng. Secundum remedium contra originale peccatum. The secunde remede thething was, that Abram by-gan i-wis, As the furst boke my[n]de mas, that is callet Genesis. When Abraham had slayne in sight four kenges, as I wreten fynde, and tane grete prayes thurght Goddes might, to plese God he had grete mynde, And the tethe of al his pray, when he to Ierusalem coom a?ayne, to keng Melchisedech that day he offert, of whiche God was fayn. Reuertenti Abraham a cede quatuor regum, &amp;c. And keng Melchisedech also, when he herd Abraham was comyng, of brede and wyne deuoutely tho the keng a?ayn made hys offring. Now to expoune wel this thing, offeringes, tethynges bothe in fere, and to haue ful vnderstonding how hit stondes I wol ow lere. ffyrste of Abraham speke wol I, what maner he wan such pray, and of Melchisedech wyterly, what mon he was I wol ow say. But ay I pray ow haues in mynde the substonce of my furst mater, ffor ther I lafte ?e sculle me fynd, haue I declaret this enter. Abraham Goddes derling was and chosen patrearch of price, and in God funde more grace thenne any that tyme, for he was wyce. So on a tyme hys brother sone, Loth, was taken with straunge men. when Habraham segh this meschef don he gose hym thider anone right thenne, And de-liueret of destresse Loth, that so taken was, slegh four kenges witht prowes, And toke grete prayes thurgh Godes grace. Tho?t he, âsithen God of his godnes has holpen me thus in this cas, the tethe of al this gret riches offre I wil ri?t in this plas.â Quen Melchisedech herd this, that Abraham was negh comyng, with brede &amp; wyne to-gedir i-wys to hym he con make his offryng. But quat this dede may signifie, morale. takes hede I wil ?ou say. As touchyng Abraham truly, tethynges he bigan Ã¾at day, That mich pleset God al-my?t And ?et dos in ich plas, for that God holdes as for his ri?t, that by Abraham bigonnen was. Melchisedech dede also, that offride to hym brede &amp; wyn, I wil expoun er that I go, tas hede to Ã¾is for luf myn. That brede &amp; wyn so offride Ã¾er was a pronosticacioun And forshowyng that we shuld her Goddes sone with deuocioun In time comyng, dede quen he wer ffor mon-kynde saluacioun, In our bodies we shuld her receyuyng brede of benisoun. And for hit shuld after bifalle Goddes body made to be of brede &amp; wyn to saue vs alle, therfore tho two Ã¾er offret he. Thus tethes in holy chirch han ben sithen Abraham was Ã¾at hom bigan, And Goddis body &amp; blode ?e sene of brede &amp; wyn sithen Crist vs wan. De origine Melchisedech regis Salem. Now one thing teche ?ou her wol I of quych mony ben in wer, of quat rote &amp; progeny Melchisedech com ?e shul her, ffor text of Bible witerly of his fadir spekys no thyng, therfore as I fynde in story telle I wil to old &amp; ?yng. Ieronymus &amp; Petrus in Historiis capitulo xl?. Melchisedech, as clercus sayn, was Seem, Noe aldest sone, And lifd on eld, nys not to layn, And made Ierusalem into wone. Qven he hade made Ã¾at fair cite, kyng of hit he callide was, Melchisedech as kyng, leue ?e me, so Seem &amp; Ã¾at nome both he has. Til Abrahams time lyuet he, As Iewes story mynde mas, And with gret solemnite both kyng &amp; prest was in Ã¾at plas. But first quen he Ã¾at cite made, Salem to nome he gaf hit tho, therfore Ã¾at nome by hit he hade kyng of Salem &amp; callide so. After his deth then mony a ?er A straunge nacioun conqueride hit, that Iebuseus callide was, And nomet after hor awen wyt Jebus Ã¾ai Ã¾er so wonyng, After hom-self now nome hit has. But sithen wan hit anoÃ¾er kyng, so a thrid peple toke Ã¾at plas, And compounde a nome in fer of two nomes hit had bifore, And sett to-geder Ã¾es wordus wer, Iebus &amp; Salem vset ?ore. De Iebus &amp; Salem compositum est nomen Ierusalem: b littera mutata in r &amp; sic vocabatur Ierusalem. Thay made one nome of Ã¾es two, Ierusalem as hom thu?t gode, saue b. letter was putt Ã¾er-fro, And r. sett Ã¾er-as b. stode. And thus was nomet that cite Ierusalem, as clerkes sayn, As I fynde by autorite hor nomes, nys not forto layn, Ierom &amp; Isodre also And Petre in Ã¾e stories als, hor witnessyng &amp; oÃ¾er mo I may not leue my?t wel be fals. De prerogatiua primogeniture quam Melchisedech habuit ex consuetudine &amp; Iacob ex supplantatione. Isidorus. One thyng is gode now to knowe, As Isidre beris gode witnes, one special thyng that I shal showe And declar ow now expresse. Melchisedech, as I saide her, Noe aldest sone was, And after kyng &amp; prest in fer, As Ã¾e Bible mynde mas. But ?e shul vnderstond wel thys, that kyng to nome Ã¾en ca?t he, for he bult Ã¾at toun i-wys And foundore was of that cite. But qvy he prestes office ber I shal declar apertly, the quych may do ow gode to her And ?e conceyue hit hertfully. That time quat sone that aldest wer this prerogatif Ã¾en hade he At offrynges &amp; gederynges in fer, that sone hade Ã¾is gret dignite, To blesse Ã¾e peple ful power, And to hym then shuld falle of fe ffirst offryng, wer it neuer so der, by vertu of Ã¾at ilke degre. And for Melchisedech aldest was of Noe sones, leue ?e me, presthode he occupiet in Ã¾at plas, And that was gret autorite, And that prerogatif clercus sayn nota. was hit that Esau sold as nys to Iacob his brother to be bayn for pulment of ful littel prys. Of Ã¾is mater qvo-so wil se the text expresly how it ys, this ilke chapitre loke wel he of Ã¾e first boke Genesis, Genesis xxv. capitulo. And ther Ã¾is mater he shal fynde, how Ã¾e ?onger broÃ¾er tho bigilet Ã¾e alder &amp; aire of kynde of heritage &amp; benisoun both two. Tercium remedium contra originale peccatum fuit sacrificii immolacio. The thrid remedy ordeynt was a?eynus our forme-fader syn, was sacrifice to gete vs gras of bestaile, as I shal ou myn, As Noe did after Ã¾e flode to plese God withe, as rede we, &amp; Abraham als that was so gode, to God obedient thai wold be, &amp; his son, that he loued most, At Goddes byddyng wold haf slayn, Agaynus him he wold not bost, bot at his biddyng ay be bayn. therfore God heghut him, leue ?e me, that of this sed shuld cum a floure, thurgh which all men shuld blesset be, Ihesu Crist our sauioure. Genesis: Ex te namque egredietur in quo omnes gentes benedicentur. Quartum remedium contra originale peccatum fuit circumcisio. Bot for thes remedes all thre were no?t accept to God all-my?t saue only of Iues and hor lyne, therfore the furth by scyll &amp; ry?t God ordenet for to serue wele all of ich cuntre a nacioun that to Goddes lagh wold fall, &amp; that was circumcisioun. For what nacioun sere hit were other than Iues, that sacrement stod hom in stid and mad hom dere to God, who-sere that merk wold hent. Quintum remedium fuit baptismus. Bot ?et for circumcisioun seruet not bot only to man, God mad the fyft bute be resoun to serue both man and eke woman, And that was fullogth after last, thur?e quych we shyn com all to blys, ?if we our lif to God wil cast And do his biddyng not amys. And alle Ã¾es waies of remedy to bete our first fader syn, Crist assaiet bodily er he out of this world wold twyn. Nota quod primum remedium Christus assumpsisse videtur, quando in templo est presentatus. The first remedy was offryng, As I declaret her bifore, In hym Crist toke Ã¾is, bout lesyng, As this day to saue our sore, Quen he was offrid Ã¾e temple to, that representid by gode ryght by offryng hym-self so to do that he his fader plese my?t. Secundum quum xl diebus ieiunauit; soluit decimas dierum, quia non habebat, vnde solueret decimas rerum. The secunde remedy also In hym he toke, as mon may se, quen he ?af teth deuoutly tho to his fadir in maieste Of his flesch &amp; blode both two, quen Ã¾at he fast, as rede we, ffourty daies with-out mo, verray teth Ã¾en offride he. ffor he hade no wordly thyng to teth to his fadir der, he tethide days with fastyng And so gaf teth for al Ã¾e ?er. Tercium remedium in se assumpsit. scilicet sacrificorum immolaciones quando par turturum aut duos pullos columbarum optulit. The thrid remedy showide he to plese his fadir most of my?t, quen that Mary with hert fre sacrifise as this day di?t A turtur bridde or pigones two, as thenne was vset law-fully, ffulfille he wold alle fulle tho that bote wit his awne body. The feurthe remedy Ã¾at he soght was whenne he circumciset was, ffor he wold fayne mon-kynde wer broght by right in-to hor furthe place. Quintum remedium quando a Iohanne baptisma suscepit. the fift remedy was Ã¾is, When he toke fullogh of sayn Iohan, and meket hym so nothing amysse ensaumpel to ?iue vs euerichone. What myght God do for vs more thenne to fulfille alle rightwisnysse and wit hit for to salue our sore, to bring vs owte of grete distresse? Secundo Christus voluit se subdere legi vt legem adimpleret secundum quod dicit: Non veni legem soluere, set adimplere. The secounde [cause] wherfore Ã¾at he wold meke hym fully to the lawe was Ã¾is, Ã¾at ?e schun sone see afture his awne word and sawe, God says he come not to vnbynd Moyses lawe in no manere, bot to fulfille hit, as I finde, In alle thing wit ful powere. for yf Ã¾at he hade bien aboute that tyme hor law for to destruye, thay mighten Ã¾o better haue byn stout Hym to haue greuet and to nye, and excuset hom as be right, âand oure lawe he kepes noghtâ, therfore his tokenne haue sette at light, Ayaynes hit ?yf he hade wroght. therfore he wold in alle thing fulfulle hit and Ã¾erto be boun, Ã¾at he might dampne wel hor doyng, and Ã¾ay bowte excusacioun. Tercio Christus voluit se subdere legi vt purificacionis tipice terminaret. The thridde cause may wele be this, that he wold bow hym mekely to Moyses lawe no thing amysse, As I schal saye apertyly. for he thoght for to make an ende of purificacioun vset so, to lyknesse therfore he wold bende To bothe, Ã¾at come betwen hom two. for be-twene two lawes i-wysse Crist come bothe to fulfulle, the alder to do, no thing amysse, The new to norische was his wille. but this vsage, leue ?e me, of purificacioun most nedeling thenne endet be, as I schal preue ow by resoun. for as thesternesse goes awaye whenne Ã¾at light be-gynnes to spring, so thing in likenesse done Ã¾at day when Ã¾at Crist come made an endyng. ffor purificacioun fulle werray come when Crist light in oure kynde, thenne figuratif most passe awaye and skilfully be putte behynde. ffor he purifiet vs on right wit werray fait at his comyng, and heuy hertes made hom light that long hauden bien in mislikyng. Bene dicitur in Actibus Apostolorum: Fide purificans co[r]da eorum. Thre offringes wel I fynde for Crist and of hym made Ã¾er wer, as I schal whil byn in mynde, Apertely nowe reherce home her. Prima oblacio de ipso a parentibus. the fursthe was of hym-selfe iwysse when he was offert tempul to, that signe of alle mekenesse ys, Ensaumpel vs so for to do. Syn he Ã¾at lorde was of Ã¾o lawe, wold bowe hym so mekele hit to fulfille, me thinke a mon schulde haue ful grete awe other to worch Ã¾en was his wille. Secunda pro ipso de auibus. the secounde offring for him was of his frindes the tempel to, of briddes, as book mynd mas, as Moyses lawe wold Ã¾ay schuld do. Ãat tokenet pouert witerly, for pore offring Ã¾er chese he and laft lomber, as reide I, Ã¾at riche men vset of grete degre. Terciam fecit ipse in cruce pro omnibus. the thridde offring was his body, when he deghet on rode tre for to bring vs of al nye and make tho Ã¾at wer thralles fre. and in that offringe trwly schowde was verray charite and sayde loue al-so sicurly, more might he not do for Ã¾e. Dicitur secundo hoc festum ypopanty, quod idem est, quam presentacio vel obuiacio, ab ypon, quod est ire, &amp; panty, quod est contra, quia Symeon &amp; Anna obuiauerunt domino. The secounde name this fest has, as I speke at byghinnyng, presentacio callet was, or elles ayain-comyng. Presentacioun skilfully hit may [be] namet, sithen he, to Ã¾e temple solempnely was offret this day, leue ?e me. Agayn-comyng I may al-so Calle Ã¾is fest be gode resoun, for Simeon and Anne bothe two Agaynes him maden processioun, Tunc accepit eum Simeon in vlnas suas. thenne, as the gospel mas mynd, Symeon Ã¾at old mon bytwhen hondes, as I finde, toke Ihesu Ã¾at he leuet on. Notandum quod triplex obumbracio siue exinanicio de saluatore nostro facta est. Thre maner of disparaging I fynde that Ihesu had this day to the temple so comyng, As I schal ful sone say. Prima exinanicio veritatis. The furst sithen that heuen keng, in whom that al sothenesse was and al maner of gode thing lif and deth, greuaunce and grace, Wold suffer of other hym so to bring with processioun to Ã¾at place, A wonder gret disparagyng. to his sothnes me think it was. Secunda exinanicio bonitatis. Secunde disparagyng was this, when he disparagide his bounte, that was God &amp; kyng of blys, clanner Ã¾en he may nothing be, Wold purifiet be, Ã¾er no nede wer, As he hade ben a synful mon, I merueil mich in my maner quen I thenk Ã¾er-opon. Tercia inanicio maiestatis. The thrid disparagyng, leue ?e me, that Crist hade may wel be this, disparagyng of his maieste, saue luf of mon, gret merueil is. ffor he that maistride alle thing And with his worde this world has wro?t, suffride of hym to make offryng And rulet alle Ã¾at hym thider bro?t. And that old mon Ã¾at hym ber he rulide, as saide Ã¾e euangely, Al this for mon so mekely her Crist tholet to bryng vs of any. Senex puerum portabat, puer autem senem regebat. then blesside Simeon swete Ihesu And heride hym with his canticuler, for by Ã¾e holi gost he knewe that hit was Crist that he so ber. Nunc dimittis. And in this song, nyl I not concele, he specifiet her nomes thre, hele, li?t, ioy of Israele, And skil qvy now ?e shun se. Salutare, lumen &amp; gloriam plebis tue Israel. Hele he calde hym skilfully, forto hele vs doun come he, And also forto iustifie wrong don to mon, leue ?e me. And also Ihesu callide is hele in our vnderstondyng, for he sauet his folk Iwys of syn in quich Ã¾ai wer lengyng. Li?t also wel cald he was, ffor men that wer in thesternes he li?tnyde quen he did vs gras, And that wist Simeon expres. Ioy of Israel eke also he may be callide skilfully, for til he come Ã¾er wer in wo Adam &amp; alle his progeny, Narracio bona sicut in quadam epistolam inueni. Now her er that I firre pas Simeon. In this mater meuet her, A tale that I se?e writen was showe I wil in gode maner. Ones I rede that Simeon, A qvile bifore that Crist was born, Isaias boke he loket opon Ecce virgo concipiet &amp;c. And fonde thes wordes hym biforn: Ecce virgo concipiet &amp; pariet filium. âSeâ, saide Ã¾e prophet Isaye, âA virgyn shal conceyue i-wys A sone &amp; ber hym wemlesly forto bryng monkynde to blis.â When Simeon segh Ã¾is ilk thing, Merueilet wonderly he was, And hopide hit hade ben fals wrytyng that he segh Ã¾er in Ã¾at plas, ffor impossible hym thu?t it wer A may conceyue by any way, And saide, âhe that wrot this her wrot fals, a waiour dar I lay.â And toke his knyf &amp; scrapet fast And this word âvirgynâ writen Ã¾er, And Ã¾er-as âvirgynâ writen was last, made âa gode wommonâ a child to ber. Deleuit hoc verbum virgo &amp; scripsit bona mulier. Qven he hade chaungide Ã¾is word so, his boke from hym he lays adoun, And thogth that he hade wel don tho And made a gode correcioun. AnoÃ¾er day quen hym list se holi writ &amp; prophecy, eft his boke then turnes he to Ã¾o wordes of Isaie, And Ã¾er-as he hade scrapet away this word âvirgynâ the day bifore, he fonde hit writen a?ayn verray, so fair letters sa?e he not ?ore. When Simeon segh Ã¾at writyng, wonder he hade gret witerly, for that boke was in his kepyng, non oÃ¾er mon my?t com Ã¾er-by. And als Ã¾at worde so writen was that so fair letter he neuer segh, vnlike to Ã¾at he writen has, for he nas neuer writer so slegh, But ?et he Ã¾o?t he wold assay qveÃ¾er Ã¾at wer thur?e God almy?t, And eft Ã¾at word he scrapis away, âvirgynâ, writen Ã¾er oright, And Ã¾er-as âvirgynâ stode bifore, he wrote âgode wommonâ in that plas, And hud his boke fro las &amp; more vnder lok for any cas. But sone opon Ã¾at oÃ¾er day his boke he openet forto se, And fonde âgode wommonâ clene away And âvirgynâ writen, as er segh he, With golden letter so curiosly that impossible i-wys it wer to any mon that wer wordly to write sich letter as was ther. Qven Simeon se?e Ã¾at it was so, then leuet he Ã¾at fullily ther hade Ã¾e holy gost ben tho And visitide hym ful graciously, And praiet God with hert fre he shuld neuer de?e ne thethen go that maidens child til he my?t se And eke hondul hym both two. Tunc responsum Accepit Simeon a spiritu sancto, non visurum se mortem nisi videret Christum Domini. Then hade Simeon an vnswar of Ã¾e Holi Gost in hi?t that for dethe schulde he not car tille he hauede sene Ã¾at suete wight, that of a virgin born schulde be, the which child was God almight, and to the tempul so come he, as Ã¾e Holy Gost behight, And as ys in the euangelei that he come the tempel to in gost, as hit says opunlye, his office mekely for to do. Dicitur in tercio hoc festum Candelaria eo quod Candele in manibus portantur accense. The thridde name Ã¾at [Ã¾]is fest has, most commune of all thre hit his, as lewde men callen hit condelmasse, ffaure causes whi I finde i-wisse. the furst is Ã¾is, as I schal saye, for summe tyme errours vset wer and forto putte hom klene awaye that was vset, as ?e schun her. Romaynes sumtyme in riche araye in the mone of ffebruer vseden a light in gode faye Ones in A fyue ?ere In worship of a god i-wisse was callet Mars, god of batail, And of his moder alle amys, s[u]pposing thai might hom auail. that Mars moder Febru hyght, and aftur hir Ã¾at mone callet was Februer, ther-fore wit light in that mone Rome mynd mas. Thenne was Ã¾at light so wu[n]der bright of torches, laumpes, leue ?e me, that men might go wele be night in vche place of Ã¾at citee. Then maden Ã¾ay to hir or praiere for to send hom Ã¾e victoree of enmeus Ã¾at come hom nere for to do hom any nye, Also thay praieden Ã¾at godesse for hor frindes saules alle, and sacrefise mayden wit mekenesse to hir, hom thoght Ã¾at best wold falle. An-other errour thai vset also, and wymmen most, as reden we, for one womon was raft hom fro, heght Proserpyn of grete degre, With suche a god, as leuet thay, that god of helle callet wasse, then soghten thay hir be night &amp; day with torches, laumpes in mony place. So long suche errours vset were that leue that custome wold thai nogh[t], but vseden hit so mony a yere, for hit seruet hom as Ã¾ay thoght. Now segh Sergius the pope Ã¾is, that hard hit was to make hom leue thing that thay had vset amys, with summe slegh[t]e that he thoght to reue, And chaunget hit in anou [Ã¾]er maner, in worschepe of oure der lady condeles one day in Februer for to be borne solempnele, Opon the purificatioun day, so that hor custum my?t be stille, but hor entencioun more verray, and ?ette fulfulle hom al hor wille. Secundo propter ostendendam virginis puritatem. The secund cause, soth to say, whi holy chirch ordenyt has to ber thiis serges as this day was this, I schal say in this place, fforto schew the grete clennes of Godde moder meke Mary, as I schal tel ?ow here expresse verray cause wherfore and whi. fforto schowe that clene was ho, neuer none so clene ny so schynyng, ther-fore the pope segh hit to do serges to bere at hir rising, Right as Holy Chirche wold say, alle men at ones in meke maner, to our lady with hert verray these wordes writen in Latyn her: Virgo beata purificatione non indiges set tota rutilas tota splendes. âBlesset virgin, moder and may, the nedes no purification, but al thow schynes soth to say, in the nys no coruptioun.â And vche mon knowes this soth ys, that purificacioun nedet hir none, for bout sede of mon i-wys ho bare Crist, ?e witten vchone. And ho hir-self als blesset was, hir moder womb when ho was in, ther-fore hir nedit no more ne lasse purificacion for no synne. Als blessed ho was by right and halowet eke, neuer none so, when Goddes gost in hir was light to wynne vs wele and wayue our wo. And ther-of ho hade such grace that to synne was ho [neuer] bowyng, ny neuer mon on hir temptet was, ?ette was neuer none so fayre lyuyng. Ther-fore alle Iewes affermen this and wondren Ã¾at hyt so myght be, that fairest floure ho was i-wys that any mon in world might se, ?ette had neuer mon fleshely sturyng to hir by spech ny by syght, but thagh mon temptet wer any thing Byfore, and loke on hir he my?t, All maner wrang temptacioun anon in hym shuld slekenet be, &amp; wille haue with deuocioun to continence &amp; chastite. therfore oure lade lykenet is to the cedre in gode faye, that nedders slees by kynde iwys with sauour of hit soth to say. So hir grete holy lyuyng to [ot]hir sauourt in the sight that al vnskylful fleschly sturyng ho slogh in hom thurgh Goddis my?t. To myrre lyknet ho is eke, for myrre slees wormes kyndly, so slees Ã¾at moder &amp; maiden meke Al maner wormus of lecchery, And this prerogatif hade ho Imong alle virgyns Ã¾at euer wer, to oÃ¾er hor holynes wold no?t do, but serue hom-selfe in gode maner, But hir holynes was so grette that alle men Ã¾at hir my?t se to chastite haden hor hert sette with lokyng on Ã¾at lady fre. Tercio propter representandam hodiernam processionem. The thrid cause is, in gode fay, to represent in gode maner processioun that was made Ã¾is day A?ayn Crist, as ?e shyn her. ffor his moder hym thider bro?t, Symeon &amp; Anne come hom a?ayne And presentide hym that al has wro?t In temple to quich he was bayn. So make we now processioun with serges li?t deuoutly, to quych serge by gode resoun likken I may Ihesu skilfully. ffor in a serge thre thingys bene, wax &amp; weke &amp; fuyr also, to quych thre, with-outen wene, Crist liknet is to alle tho. ffor wax is Cristes flesch &amp; blode, that taken was of a clene may, bout corrupcioun &amp; alle gode, bout wem of syn, als soth to say. ffor ri?t as bees of herbes clene worchyng wax bout engendryng, so bro?t Mary forth, as I mene, Ihesu Crist our heuen kyng. The weke, Ã¾at in Ã¾e wax hid is, to Cristes saule may liknet be In flesch &amp; blode hid wel i-wys, that God toke of a maiden fre. The fuyr also or ellis li?t tokenys godhede bout lesyng, for, as Ã¾e boke sais, God almy?t is a fuyr al swolowyng. Deus noster ignis est consumens. Quidam metricus de cereo sic ait: Hanc in honore pie candelam porto Marie, Accipe per ceram carnem de virgine veram. Per lumen numen maiestatisque cacumen. Quarto propter nostram instruccionem candele accense in manibus isto die portantur. The furth cause is couenable qvy we condels ber this day, that is to wit to make vs able to Ã¾at lif Ã¾at lastes ay, And also more stif &amp; stable And no?t faynt in Goddes fay, And tokenyng fulle with-outen fable of serges beryng I wil now say. Thre thinges we most kepe oryght in vs for saule saluacioun, fulle faith, &amp; to gode vs di?t, the thrid ri?twis entencioun. And thes vertues wel I fynde In the condel qven it is li?t, for wax is clene &amp; fair of kynde, And li?t may token God al-my?t, And quen tho two to-geder bene, wax &amp; fuyr as I nowe say, verray faith, as wel is sene, And gode dede wel mete may. ffor as a candel Ã¾at fu[yr]les es Is dede &amp; no comfort Ã¾er-in, And li?t bout candel is non i-wys, so faren Ã¾es vertues forto twyn, ffaith verray from worthy dede or worthy dede from faith verray twynnet, ben no?t to help at nede, but both to-gedir wel serue Ã¾ai may. The weke, Ã¾at in Ã¾e condel is, ri?twys entencioun may wel be, for monnus tho?t as weke i-wys Is hud Ã¾at hit may no mon se. For thus techis sayn Gregory, our open dedes forth to shawe, that the entencioun priuely be hyd Ã¾at hit no mon may knawe. Sic sit opus in publico, vt tamen intencio maneat in occulto. Gregorius. Thus verray faith, gode dede also, And eke ri?twys entencioun to serge moun be liknet so for monnus edificacioun. ther ?if we wil clene be bifore God at our last day we most haue Ã¾es vertues thre, that I to serge wel likken may. Miraculum beate Marie. Now a miracle of Mary Miraculum beate Marie in purificatione. that bifel ri?t as Ã¾is day I wil telle apertely, herkenes to me I ?ou pray. A worthi woman ones wasse that hade ful grete deuocioun to owre lady ful of grace, and aye to worship hir was boun. So bult ho beside hir place A chapel of ful grete renoun, And vche day a masse ho has for any ocupacioun. Of oure lady Ã¾at mas schuld be, for hir wold ho no waye for?ete, and spend much gode in charite ffor hir loue, of Ã¾at ho might gete. So neght Ã¾is fest [of] condelmasse, hir prest had ?eten him leue to go on serten nedes what-seuer hit was, that to Ã¾at fest come he not tho. So boute masse nede most ho be suche meschef shope as Ã¾at day, for this maner, leue ?e me, this woman hade Ã¾at I schal saye. Who-seuer wold aske hir any gode for the loue of our lady, ?iuen hit was wit mild mode, what were in hond anone in hye. so hade ho ?iuen a littel before hir mantel for our lady sake, And wold haue ?iuen mich more for hir to alle Ã¾at euer wold take. So sithen that ho was mantilles, to Ã¾e chirch mi?t ho not pas, qverfore ho was in gret tristes that ho that day was bout a mas. Qven ho segh no bote wold be In-to hir chapel sone ho went, And bifore our lady fre ho kneles doun with gode entent. And sone as sho lay Ã¾er prayng, ho fel on slepe &amp; mette onon that ho was in a chirche knelyng, the fairest ho euer segh any one, And loket about in ich plas, then segh ho virgyns in comyng, gret novmber of hom hir thu?t Ã¾er was, that ho hade neuer so gret likyng. Bifore hom, as boke mynde mas, A qvene Ã¾er come with croun shynyng, to Ã¾e qver an esy pas ho gos, Ã¾e remenaunt hir suyng. Quen Ã¾e qvene had sett hir doun And ichon after hor degre, comus one in with burthen boun of serges wonder gret plente, And takes Ã¾e qvene a serge in hie, And after alle Ã¾at wer Ã¾er-in. quen Ã¾ai wer seruet by &amp; by opon Ã¾e matroun ho con myn, And takes hir a serge onone, of Ã¾e quych ho was ful fayn, And tho?t from hir shuld it not gone, ny hit wold ho not ?yue a?ayn. Quen Ã¾is was don, ho segh comyng serge-berers solempnely, deken, southdeken hom suyng, And prest reuescht ful rialy. The serge-berers angels wer, And hir thught in hir entent deken, southdeken to God der wer seynt Laurence &amp; saynt Vincent. The prest Ã¾at song Ã¾e mas i-wys was Ihesu Crist ful of gras, that fully as Ã¾e vsage is Confiteor saide ri?t in Ã¾at plas. Sone two Angels clerly Ã¾er bigunnen Ã¾e offys of Ã¾e mas, so swete song herd ho neuer er As hir thught that songen was. So passede Ã¾ai forth bi proces til Ã¾at time was of offryng. then went the whene, as maner wes, And offrid hir serge doun knelyng, And alle Ã¾e oÃ¾er ful deuoutly vchone after hor degre, but thys wommon witerly wold not remewe from hir se. So abode Ã¾e prest ful long fforto abide hir offryng, And thai tho?ten hit a wrong that hir come was so tarying. Then sent Ã¾e qvene of virgyns sone to Ã¾is matroun a messager, And saide hit was ri?t wrongly done to tarie Ã¾e prest in Ã¾at maner. And ho sende worde sone agayn And bad Ã¾e prest syng forth mas, for of Ã¾at serge ho was so fayn that siker from hir shuld hit not pas, That was ?yuen hir, ho wold hold, And from hir shuld hit not away. the messager the whene so tolde, thenne semet ho wroth, the soth to say, And sent a?ayne the messager, and bad reue hir that serge in hy, but ho wold offer in gode maner as thay deden al the company. The messager doos the whene bidding and eft comes to this matroun, but leue hit wold ho for nothing for suche was hir deuocioun. The messager segh ho was stout and sone lays honde on hir right ther and of hir hond wold pull[e] hit out and that fare might hir not fer. Grete beker was betwene hom two, whether schuld haue the more maistri, for that on end ho held tho and ho that other wel and stifly. so stryuen thay long in this maner that at the last broken hit was, that one half had the messager, that other halfe the wommon has, And right so in this serge breking the wommon woke, and in hir honde as ho mette byfore sleping fonde halfe the serge thurgh Goddes sonde. Then hade ho wonder wytterly and of hir sweuen ho hir by-tho?t, and thonket God and our lady that so wel had for hir wroght, And such masse gete hir that day and such condul forto bren, al-thagh ho lufde our lady ay Mor ho onouret our lady thene. When this matroun told this cas schewet that seurge from heuen sent, all men thonket God of his grace and oure lady with gode entent. And that seurge anon don was emong relykes most reuerent, &amp; who-sere touchet hit hele has in what langour sere he be lent. Thus halp oure lady this matroun as ho dos all men sicurly that in hir han deuocioun and worshipon hir deuoutly. De occisione Innocencium &amp; de Herode Ascalonica &amp; eius vxore. Now speke we of the Innocent?, de innocentibus. that for Crist martert were with-outen defaut of any offence vnder Eroud, as ?e shin here. Thre Erodes I fynd there were i-wis that grete nome haden, that is no nay, In vr[ec]hedenesse and doyng mysse, hor nomes here I shal ?ow say. The furst As-calonita was, that regnet when that Crist was borne &amp; slogh the Innocent? bout trespas, for whech dede his saule was lorne. The secund Erode slogh saint Iohn, that bapti?et Crist omnipotent In the water of flem Iordan &amp; for to preche byfore him went, Antipas that Erod hy?t &amp; he regnet in Iude that tyme that Ihesu ful of my?t Deghet opon the rode tre. the thrid Erod Agrippa was that slogh seint Iame, as rede we, &amp; prisonet Petur also has, as be thes verse? mon may se: As-calonuta necat pueros, Antipa Iohannem, Agrippa Iacobum, claudens in carcere Petrum. but thes two las?t now leue wol I &amp; of the first speke now here, as I fynd in trew story how he was kyng now ?e moun lere. Petrus in Historiis Scolasticis. A duke Antipater Ydumee, that was a mon gret &amp; worthy, Weddet, in boke as rede we, the kynges do?tur of Araby, &amp; on hir a son ther gete he &amp; callet hym Erod witerly, that Ascalonica, leue ?e me, was callet aftur, as rede I. &amp; to this Erod ?iuen was Be the emperour of Rome the lond of Iude, &amp; hit has byfore that Crist our kyng nome. Then was scheptre first put away from Iudas kynd, Iacob son, thirgh whom, as I byfore con say, the Iues nome com first in wone. Whech profecy, to myn aw on, gode is I reherse here In Latyn wordus, as I con, that Iacob said, is gode to lere: Non auferetur sceptrum de Iuda &amp; dux de femore eius, donec veniat qui mittendus est, &amp; ipse erit expectacio gencium. Now was fulfyllet this proficie when that Erod was mad kyng and sceptre from Iudas rote therby put away, Crist negh comyng. This Erod sex sons has that were worthe men &amp; noble, Antipater the first was, Alysandre and Aristoble, Archelaus the furth hy?t, the fyft Erodes Antipas, the last Fylyp, thus in our sy?t all six arn recconet in this place. But Alexander and Aristoble, that both of on modur were, to Rome he send, for thai were noble &amp; scharpe of witte letteur to lere. Long aftur thai com hom agayn, wele lernet &amp; ry?t conyng, And stryuen more Ã¾en did hom gayn After hor fadir to haue ben kyng. ffor both two of on modir wer And hor moder was a Iewes, therfore Ã¾ai helden so in fer And putten hor fadir to destres Auther of hom forto haue ?yuen the successioun of his londe, And for this cause with hym thai stryuen that broght hom after in gret bonde. Also thai tho?ten hom-self conyng And more worthy Ã¾en oÃ¾er wer, quen they wer comyng fro studying thai hopiden to haue ben more der. But Heravde segh thay wro?ten so, his aldest sone he put bi-fore, And supplantid hom both two of his heritage las &amp; more. Thay seghen this &amp; casten in hie to haue slayn hym ?if Ã¾ai my?t, the kyng knew hor kest priuely And exilede both in hy?t. When Ã¾ai both Ã¾us exilet wer, to Ã¾e emperoure thai went to pleyn on hor fadir in fer, that sone Heraude was after sent. But qvil Ã¾is strif was enduryng, Ihesu Crist was born i-wis And thre kynges thider comyng, As ?e knowen wel al Ã¾is. And quen Ã¾ai asket a kyng that born was of Ã¾e Iewes kynde, Heravde was of hor come dredyng thurgh double ferdship as I fynde. One cause lest a kyng verray of Iewes blode Ã¾en born had be to haue supplauntid hym, soth to say, for verray commlyng Ã¾en was he, And supposide ?if Crist mi?t spryng, that Ã¾en was born Ã¾er in Ã¾at londe, hym-self wer shent in time comyng And thrast hym out that child wold fonde. But neuer-Ã¾e-later in Ã¾at myschef Heraude plesede Ã¾e kynges thre, And let as hor word had ben lef, Al-tha?e in hert ful wroth was he, And bad hom sech qver Ã¾at he wer And come &amp; warn hym hou hyt stode, that he my?t honour that child der, but in-ward wille of hym was wode. Quen Heravde se?e Ã¾ai come no?t A?ayn to hym as Ã¾ai bihi?t, he supposide &amp; fully tho?t thai wer bigilet of sterre ly?t, and failide so Ã¾at child to fynde As men wer lad with fantasy. thus kest Heroude in his mynde, for they come no?t agayn hym by, But turnet oÃ¾er ways for shame, sithen Ã¾ai failede foul so, lest Ã¾ai hade lest Ã¾er-by hor name hor londe so folily to com fro. And thus from slaght of innocens A qvile he put away his tene, til sheperdis prechiden in his presens And tolden quat si?t thai hade sene. Simeon &amp; Anne also of Crist als beren gode witnes. then was Heravde wonder wo, And for thes tithynges had tristes that kinges were so foule a-goo, and in his hert he kest expresse to sle alle childer anoon tho aboute Bedleme Ã¾at born wesse. thenne come an naungel from heuen adoun to Ieseph as he lay sleping, and bad him make him sone boun in-to Egipt to be hying. thenne token Ieseph &amp; Mary the child and to Egipt went, and seuen ?ere afture sicurly in that lond Ã¾ere thai were lent, ay til king Heroude was deide, in a cite Ã¾at callet was Hermepolym, and Ã¾ere we[r] lede as trwe story mynde mase. Ã¾en was fulfillet the prophecy that I in Latyn sone schal saye, that spak, Ã¾e prophete Ysaye a twousand ?ere befor in faye. for maumetes, as book minde mas, fellen doun at his comyng In temples and in vche plas, In tokenyng Ã¾at he was heuen king. Ecce dominus ascendit super nubem leuem, &amp; ingredietur Egiptum, &amp; mouebuntur simulacra Egipti a facie domini exercituum. Cassioder beres witnesse Nota bene. that in Ermopel Ã¾at cite was a tre of grete suetnysse, persidis callet was, leue ?e me, The whiche tre suche vertu hade, mony men thurgh hit helet were and of meschef releuet radde wit fruyt, lef, bark, Ã¾at hit bere. Whenne Crist to Egipt come anone taward that tre of grete vertu, hit bowet doun to the erthe opon for to honur oure lord Ihesu, And roos huppe afture, as wold a mon that men by sight fully knewe, and merueilden Ã¾erof vchone, for Ã¾at sight was o the nwe. Hec Cassiodorus, item Petrus Comestor vt inferius. Whil Heroud was so conietting the childer deth bi his entent, sodaynly felle letting, for to Rome he was afture sent By letturs fro the emperoure at sewte of his sones two. so steret he was in Ã¾at stowr, that alle his thoght was on hit tho, And tariet to sle the innocente? til Ã¾at processe hade an ende. so for ferde of more offense to Rome radle he con winde, And as he toward Rome went be Tharse lond was his goyng, all the chippes of Tharse he brent in despite of Tharse keng, And for the chippes, as he herd saye, haden broght hom the kenges thre, alle he brend hom in his waye, his foule wille so fullet he. Then was endet that prophecy that Dauid sais in his sauter: âwith wode spirit he con destry the shippes of Tarse in foule maner.â In spiritu vehementi conteres naues Tharsis. Qven Heravde come to Rome tho, grete altercacioun &amp; debate bitwene hym &amp; his sones two raiset was for his astate. ffor outhir of hom his air wold be bi-cause hor moder a Iewes was, therfore hom thught Ã¾at in Iude to regne best skil hir child has. Also fro lettrure Ã¾ai wer kent, thai tho?t hom-self Ã¾e more worthy, ffor Alexandir was ful excellent And wondir conyng in clergy. But after grete altercacioun bitwene Heroud and hom two bifore lordes of grete renoun, this moot thus was endit tho, That Heroud schuld haue ful power bi the emperoure decre, whiche sone so his wille wer to make his heyr as wilnet he, And that hys sones in al thing to hym schulden be obedient, thus lordly at al his liking to his londe a?ayn he went. When he was comen home a-?ayne more harde thenne he was bifore, he kest the childer schulden be slayn for Cristes burthe that greuet hym sore, And anoon his men he sent and slogh knaue childer of tow ?er that werne about Bedlem lent, and als withinne that eld that wer. Exponitur a bymatu, vt in Historiis Scolasticis. In-as-miche as the ewangely spekes of tow ?er and withinne of childer eldes to destruy, one trew story I wol ou mynne, As by the trewest opinioun from childer that weren of one night to tow ?er ful, ?e leue moun, Heroud maad sle vche wight, ffor by the kenges lernet he that Crist was born that ilk, day that thay the sterre furst con se, as the aungel to hym con say, And for a ?er was gone fulle wil that he to Rome went, he kest tyme of burthe ther-by, as he was by the kenges kent, One ?er forto haue by-fore, an other after-ward comyng, that skilfully he most be bore withinne that tyme for anythyng. And als in hert Heroud kest this syn sterres serueden hy[m] o-right, that transforme hym wel i-wys to more elde other lasse he might As in semyng, sothe to say, ther-fore Heroud wold seker be, and of two ?er fully in fay to one night borne thenne slogh he. Alia opinio super hoc verbum a bimatu. Iohannes Crisostomus sic exponit vt infra. Iohan with the guylden mouthe iwys expounes hit in other maner, and says by his opinion this,â bitwene two ?ere &amp; fyue Ã¾ai wer, But inwith two ?er slayn was non, for bifore fully a ?er Er Crist was born, as sais this Ion, the sterre to kynges con apere. Therfore knaue childer two ?er olde he sl[o]gh, but noght ?unger then thay, bitwene to and fyue, as I tolde, of elde thay wer, as Iohan con say. As by this euidence, as says he, hyt semes wel for to be so, ffor bones of hom that men moun se Arm longer thenne childer of ?eres two. But ther-a?ayn mon vnsuar may that tyme men and childer were wel more thenne thay ben this day and in vch eld more of power, So that the first opinion clerkes hoden most verray, that in-with tow ?e[r] be reson the childer slayne wer, in gode fay. Macrobius in Saturnalibus: qualiter Herodes iuste fuerat punitus. But Heroud in hys wykkedenesse was pinischet resonabuly, as Macrobius beres wutenysse, one wengeance to him felle Ã¾er-bi, For one sone of his there was slayn that was ?iuen to keping, of whiche was Heroud no-thing fayn, but in gre[t] sorow and misliking, So Ã¾at God lord of rightwisnesse nold not vnuenget Ã¾at hit wer, his wrongful dedes of wickettenesse, but punischet bothe in heuen and her, God wold that he lost his lykyng and chastiset wer in that maner, that maade so mony mon syking and moderes for hor childer dere. thenne was fulfillet the prophecy that I in Latyn thenke to say, for lettert men that sitten by to conferme this in gode faye: Vox ploratus &amp; vlulatus audita est in Rama, id est excelsis. But ?ette God wold not leue hym so, but more meschef send him opon, for alder sones other two he sloght, as ?e schun her anone. Alisaunder, Aristoble tho, that striuen whit him a littul before, he hade suspect of gyltes moo, the greuet him vyle sore. For one Ã¾at was wit hom priue, the whiche thai tristes in al thing, had disc[reue]t, leue ?e me, hor covnseil holle to the keng, And told how thai haden hym bihight grete ?iftes and eke richesse to poysoun Heroud, ?if he myght, and Ã¾is to hym was told expresse. His barbour confesset eke al-so that him was heght a grete wynning of tho sones bothe two to kutte his throte in berd shauyng, For Alisaunder to hym con say that in a nold mon was no tryst thagh he kempt day for day his hore lokkes, when Ã¾at him lust, For to make him seme ?ungly, ther-fore he sayde Ã¾at hit was gode for to deliuer him hastely, that al his lif hade ben so wode. Qven that Heravde herd this thing, greuet he was gretly tho And onon bout tarying made to sle hom both two, And made his aldest son his air, Antipater that callide was, but he cast Heraude to appair sone after, as boke mynde mas. ffor Heraude pleside in alle thing his sones childir that he hade slayn, Antipater hade no likyng ne of Ã¾at dede was he not fayn, And lest he hade chaunget his wille And deseride hym any way, with venym he cast hym to spille, that was told Heraude soth to say. Quen Ã¾at Heraude herd of Ã¾is thyng, Anon he put hym in prisoun, til he my?t for his trespassyng punysch hym as was resoun. Quen Ã¾e emperour herde say that kyng Heraude has thus done, he saide hym hade leuer, in gode fay be Heraudes swyn Ã¾en Heraude sone, ffor sithen that he conuertet was to Iewes faith &amp; hor lyuyng, to sle swyne he sparet has And slayn his sones olde &amp; ?yng. Qven Heraude of gret elde wes, sixti ?er &amp; therto ten, for veniaunce of his wrecchidnes he swal &amp; stank both feet &amp; knen, And a strong feuer eke hade he And al his body in sich swellyng that for gret stench, leue ?e me, negh hym mi?t no mon be dwellyng. Qven Iewes herden Ã¾at he ferd so, li?t &amp; likyng Ã¾en Ã¾ai wer that Ã¾ai shuld be delyueret Ã¾o of Ã¾at tiraunt in sich maner. Qven this was told Heraude onon that Iewes enioiet of his wo, gret lordes sonus euerichone he putt in prisoun sone tho, And praiet his suster Salome that ho shuld, quen Ã¾at he wer dede, sle hom all &amp; lett non fle, And ho grauntide to do his rede, ffor he wilnet soueraynly that men shuld reme &amp; sorewe make quen he wer dede, Ã¾o men for-thy gyltlesly he made to take, That ?if Iewes nold not Ã¾en reme for hym qven he wer gone, thay my?t reme for Ã¾es oÃ¾er men that he bad so sle euerichone, ffor he desyrit at his de?yng that ich mon shuld make dele, And for his deth ne his partyng wold no mon reme he wist wele. Then [h]ad Heraude Ã¾is maner quen he hade eten &amp; wold wende to par an appul, ?if any wer, And ete Ã¾at atte last ende. So toke he a knyf in hy As thagh he tho?t nothing amys, And waitet Ã¾er was no mon by for styke hym-self he wold i-wys. But on frend Ã¾er was negh stondyng And toke Ã¾e knyf out of his honde, And for this dede was told tithing that Heraude was dede al Ã¾e londe. When Antipater herd of this, his sone that so in prisoun wasse, muche myrthe forsothe iwisse for his fader deth he maas. When Heroud herd Ã¾at he did so, anone he made gurd of his hede, and Archelaus him leuyng tho he maad his heir when he wer dede. Thenne after-ward the fift daye deghet Heroud wrecchetly, and his suster, soth to saye, deliueret the prisones in hye, The whiche Heroud hade beden before schulden be slayn, when he wer deed, ho thoght ho schulde see hym no mor and took hir to a better rede. Thus endet Heroud, as rede we, but what tyme and also ?er, her-after anone ?e schun see datat the tyme fulle enter. Petrus in Histore capitulo xlv?. This ?er was born the gode saint Iohan, Euangelist that callet his, Imong the aposteles euerichone wit Crist none louet was so wel i-wis. And also in this selue ?er deghet Heroud Ã¾at cruel keng, that regnet in Iude boute wer seuen and thritte ?er during. Eusebius libro primo capitulo vij?. Now ?e schun here a wikketnysse that Heroud did at his deghing, he commavndet his men expresse go to the tempel for any-thing, And brenne al bokes thai mighten finde of Iewes store and begynnyng, that no mon schuld haue after mynde that before him was any keng, for he supposet in that maner a grete nome to wyn him i-wis, ?if mynde of other for?eten were and his nome so bro?t huppe amys, but ?ette haden Iewes in trosory at hoome tho bokes euerichone, so Heroudes wiles witerly aftur his deght ther seruet him none. Anno Augusti xlvii? &amp; gracie vij?. Item Petrus in Histore capitulo li?. This ?er at aungeles forwarning come Ihesu a?ayn to Iude, after sex ?er duelling in Egipt, as sone rede we. thenne was fulfillet, as knowen trwe, that Ysay told before leuyng, that God wold calle his sone Ihesu from Egipt, as I schal ou myng. Ex Egipto vocaui filium meum &amp;c. Anno Augusti liij? &amp; gracie xii?. this ?er Ihesu funde was In tempel wit doctours sputyng, that alle men wonderten of the grace that he had thenne in forthe-shoyng. Anno Augusti lvij? &amp; gracie xv?. This ?er deghet Octauiain the worthy emperour of Rome, puysnet as mony before hauen, and of his wif Ã¾at wenym come. This lord so wel beloued was wiht al naciouns, nys no nay, that was neuer noon had such grace with stronge and couthe, al in gode fay. ffor men of Inde fer in the est that know neuer route ther before, senden hym tribut most and lest, so deden thay to no nother ?ore. Summe kenges from hor remmes went and habit of Rome token hom opon to kepe hys bridul wihit gode entent in worscip of that worthy mon. To senatoures he was benigne, to tho tha[t] louet studfast ay, to cacche loue ful straunge and digne, ther-as loued he went neuer away. In lettrur he was excellent, for al the seuen ars cuthe he, of speche was none in londe lent that hade suche schowyng, leue ?e me, Was neuer day from hom schuld pass that he nold rede or elles write or elles occupiet he was of grete materes forto dispuyte. Ysidorus libro primo: de x. litera. This emperour fonde furst i-wys x. lettre, as well rede I, in stude of whiche bifor amys C. s. men teken wyterly. And that tyme right wel founden hit was schap of the croice to represent, for verray schap of croyce hit has for Crist that tyme in lond was lent, The wyche on croice wold by vs alle like that lettre thenne new made, ther-fore hyt wolde best by-falle that tyme in boke for to be hade. De septuagesima &amp; eius institucione. Of Septuagesme speke we, the which for lewet de-clare wol I what worde septuegesme may be and whi hit maad was wyterly. Septuagesme bygynnes that day that alleluya closet is, and lastes to the Setter-day in the Ester weke i-wis. In quych time, soth to say, sixty daies &amp; ten Ã¾er bene, that exposicioun is verray of septuagesme with-out wene. Prima causa quare septuagesima instituta est. Ion Beleth, Ã¾at a gret clerk was, thre skilles showes, as I shal say, qvi holi chirch ordeynt has septuagesme thus vset ay. At holi chirch bigynnyng sone after Cristes ascencioun, holi fadirs then lyuyng maden Ã¾is constitucioun, That in worship of that day that Crist from heuen to erth went, Thursday shuld be honouret ay As Sonday is with gode entent. ffor sithen our kynde so honoures was And bro?t that day to heuen blis, therfore, as boke mynde mas, the mor thai worshipet hit i-wys, And maden open processioun Apostles dede to represent, that thai did with deuocioun to Oliuete quen Ã¾ai with hym went. But afterward ful mony a ?er, quen martirs wer so thik slayn, to honour hor festes &amp; make hom der holi chirch was glad &amp; fayn. And laften Ã¾at solemnite to honour sayntes &amp; hor day, for to gret charge hit had be forto serue both, soth to say. ?et in recompensacioun of Ã¾at solemnite lettide so, holi chirch bi gode resoun one weke of fastyng ordeynt tho Bifore lent on forto be, that al shuld not go out of mynde, And septuagesme, leue ?e me, that weke Ã¾ai calliden, as I fynde. And so come this nome on plas, septuagesme, as er saide I, And holden that nome sithen it has, As I fynde in trewe story. Secunda causa quare septuagesima fuerat instituta. Another cause alegge I may qvy septuagesme ordeynt was, In significacioun, soth to say, As Ã¾e same Ion mynde mas, ffor septuagesme in gode fay may signifie for our trespas time of our puttyng away from paradise Ã¾at ioyful plas, ffor our forme-fadir syn exilet vs from Ã¾at same blis, til Ã¾at Crist come forto wyn that wele a?ayn forsoth i-wys. But al-Ã¾a[?] Crist vs so for-bo?t after our deth, ?if we gode wer, to come to blis, ?et wold he no?t that Adam syn wer fully cler, ffor qvo-ser lyuen most at lykyng, wer neuer bout tribulacioun sithen Ã¾e worldes bygynnyng quyl body &amp; soule to-geder be moun. Therfore fro time Adam did mys til Ã¾e day of dome shal be I may calle, forsoth i-wys, time of trespas, leue ?e me, And time also of exilyng this world is now &amp; euer ?et was, ffor ay qvil we ben her lyuyng trauaile we han for our trespas. for al-thagh we thur?e Cristes deth when we de?en comen to blis, qvil in Ã¾e body is lif or breth fulle rest shul we neuer haf i-wis. And this time qvil we exilet bene bi seuen days is ay turnyng, And closet also bout wene In seuen thousande ?er rennyng. ffor after clerkes opinioun from Ã¾e worldes bygynnyng A principio mundi usque ad finem. til Ihesu Cristes ascencioun sex thousande ?er wer, bout lesyng, And from thethen forth i-wys til Ã¾e world shal endid be, the seuen thousande taken is, but after Ã¾at time witen not we Hou long Ã¾e world shal last i-wys, for Ã¾at terme may no mon se saue God hym-self, leues wel this, by no gode autorite. But in this six eld, as I say, we that vnwisely exilet wer, to hope of ioy that lastes ay restoret we wer in gode manere. After our doyng day for day And gode lyuying qvil we ben her, quen we ben dede, trist we may thur?e Cristes deth to won in fer, ffor thur?e fulloght in gode fay of Adams gylt we wesch vs cler, then gostly exil went away And we restoret to first power. Therfore iche ?er no?t amys vside is and alway has, qven septuagesme bigunnen is, time of exilyng &amp; trespas, We bigynnen to wayue i-wis song of ioy &amp; of solas, Alleluya, nothing amys, til time come representyng gras. On pasch euen, ?e sene wel Ã¾is, Alleluya a?ayn mon tas, And then bygynnes a newe blis quen holi chirch Ã¾at mynde mas, But one alleluya bout mo we syngen Ã¾en, to represent that in Ã¾e sext eld thur?e Crist tho hope of fulle ioy we han hent. A tracte Ã¾en is after suyng, the quych wel may signifie that gret trauail her lyuyng suffre we most continuely To fulfille Goddis biddyng til we moun com to his mercy, ffor in Ã¾e seuent eld, bout lesyng, dede bitides vs bodily. then in Ã¾e e?t eld, bout lesyng, from deth to lif, as rede I, er then no rest is ne lykyng to no mon lyuyng fullily. Septima etas est moriencium, octaua resurgencium. So the sixt elde wonnen is the wele from quich we wayuet wer, the seuent eld Ã¾at is deth i-wys, that bodily we most haue her. then afterward shal we not mys the ioy Ã¾at is in heuen cler, Ihesu bryng vs to Ã¾at blys, that Mary of hir body ber! Therfore that selue Seterday that septuagesme shal endet be, two alleluyas, in gode fay, both to-gedir syngen we, In significacioun that double merit shul we haue, ?if we godely lif moun, our saule from syn forto saue. Then septuagesme, as saide I, that tokenys monkynde exilyng, makes an ende al fullily And we in ioy euer-lastyng. [T]e[rti]a causa quare septuagesima est instituta. The thrid cause assigne I may, As ?e fully leue moun, qvy hit was ordeynt in gode fay, was for representacioun. ffor septuagesme, with-outen wer, representes subiectioun that Iewes ten &amp; sixty ?er hade in Babuloyn in bandoun. And right as thay in that daunger layden doun murthes, so in prusoun als song of murthe we lyueng her layn doun this tyme by gode resoun. ffor as the Byble mynde mas, Nabugodononosor the keng took Ierusalem that holy place And made in Babiloyne hor wonny[n]g, And al was for hor owen trespasse that thay ne deden Goddes biddyng, thenne laft thay song and al solace And sayden whil that was enduryng: Quomodo cantabimus canticum in terra aliena. âGoddes song how schuld we syng, thus lengyng in a straunge londe? more mater we han of mournyng whil we ben hoden thus in bonde.â But after in the sexte ?ere leue thay haden to go a?ayne, thenne maden thay murthe in hor maner, and wer at Goddes byddyng bayn. therfore on pasche euen i-wys one alleluy wel syngen we to represent hor grete blys, that in the sexty ?ere schuld be. But foor-as-muche as thay tho trauaileden ten ?ere tenderly fforto twynne Babiloyne fro whit hor goddes that dyd hom ny. In caryage from place to place so hoom flyttyng that foolk in fere, ther-fore holy chirche maas a mynd ther-of in thys maner, And one pasche euen solempnely singyn a tracte no thyng amys anone after the alleluy, that tokenes trauayl wel i-wys. But thenne Setu[r]day nextte suyng when septuagesme an ende maas, two alleluyes boute lesyng holy chirche togeder taas, That ful ioy may singnyfy when thay wer in hor londe in reste, thenne might thay sing solempnely this canticuler wel of the best: Laudate dominum omnes gentes &amp;c. this time of takyng &amp; exil of Iewes that in thraldom wer, tokens trauail &amp; peril whil we in world bene lyuyng her. ffor ri?t as thay from that any In Ã¾e sexty ?er wer bro?t, so in Ã¾e sext elde witerly Crist of bitter bale vs bo?t. And as thay trauailet day by day to flitte hor goddes home agayn, so most we in this elde ay In gode dedes to make vs fayn. Then to Ã¾e seuent eld that deth is nedelynges we most come to, And then to perfite rest i-wys ?if we bifore woln godely do, And sing Ã¾er double Alleluy euer-more with-outen ende, To quych thur?e his mercy he make vs worthy forto wende! De sexagesima &amp; eius institucione. Sexagesme is bygynyng opon Ã¾at selue Sononday that we this offys con syng, Exurge domine, in gode fay, next after septuagesme suyng, And in pasch weke endes ay on Wednesday, by acountyng, As I shal ful sone say. Instituta est sexagesima propter recompensacionem, significacionem &amp; representacionem, vt patet inferius. Sexagesme wel ordeynt was first in recompensacioun of fastyng Ã¾at popes conen whace by gode deliberacioun, And also as boke mynd mas In representacioun of our forbying to Ã¾at plas that we so lost a?eyn resoun. The thrid cause was in tokenyng, As I shal ful sone telle, of wydowhode, with-out lesyng, that holi chirch in con dwelle. Holi chirche wydohode I may calle, as thinkes me, time that apostles bode the holi gost with hert fre After Cristes ascencioun quyl thay wer in hor praier, that widohode we calle moun of holi chirch, as ?e shyn her. But ?et by sum opinioun holi chirch widohode Mich larger may be tane then that time that Ã¾ai so abode, That is from Ã¾e ascencioun euen into Ã¾e worldes ende, qven Crist shal deme vs by resoun And all Ã¾at gode ben with hym wende. Then Crist &amp; holy chirch also shyn be feghet both in fer, As I shal er Ã¾at I go sone declar owe more cler. Quod instituta est propter recompensacionem. As to Ã¾e first cause i-wys, that is recompensacioun, nota. hit was ordeynt not amys, As I shal preue by gode resoun. Two popes godely ordeynt Ã¾is, Melchisedech, Siluestre also, sithen Seterday after Friday ys next day suyng onon tho, And on Friday skilfully In penaunce ich mon most be of fastyng, prayer specialy, for God Ã¾en deghet on rode tre, Therfore thay ordeynt Seterday iche mon forto ete twye, that to gret fastyng in gode fay hor kynde to mych shuld not destruy. Then in recompensacioun of Ã¾is fastyng laide doun so, one weke bifore Ã¾e lentoun thai ordeynt time of fastyng tho, And sexagesme calden hitt, this weke Ã¾at so ordeynt was, And this nome thus by my witt of se[x]agesme com first on plas. ij? propter [signific]acionem. AnoÃ¾er cause I may showe qvi se[x]agesme was ordeynt so, In tokenyng fully ?e shul knowe of widohode, as I saide tho. Qven Crist to heuen blis went, Apostles destitute Ã¾en wer, And that was widohode verrayment of holi chirch, as I say her. And sexagesme may signifie wydohode wel leue ?e me, As bifore declaret I the time, as ?e moun sothly se. But in fulle reconselyng of holy kirk Ã¾at widow was to Ihesu Crist our heuen kyng that so stegh to heuen plas, therfore to chirch in his absence was left two wynges witerly to fli?e with to his presence And come to Crist hir spouse Ã¾erby. Due ale sunt sex opera misericordie &amp; decem precepta decalogi. That one wyng I may wel call the sex wercus of mercy, that oÃ¾er wyng, as wel wyl falle, the ten comaundementes don duly. therfore sexagesme i-wis on Englisch is as mich to say, As sex sith ten nothing amys, or ten sith six, preue hit I may. By sex I may wel vnderstonde the sex wercus of mercy, by ten lagh ?yuen of Goddus honde, the ten comaundementes truly. And the two wynges so laft he In erth that we with hom shuld flie to blis, ?if we about be to fulfulle hom fullylie. iij? ratio propter representacionem. The thrid cause, ?e mot be kent, why sexagesme ordeynt was, my?t be wel to represent that God forbo?t vs thurgh his gras. To fulfulle, as was resoun, bi long processe Ã¾at ilk plas Ã¾at Lucifer, quen he fel doun, thur?e pride so foule lost has. By ten I vnderstonde her mon Ã¾at was made to ful a?ayn An order lost by Lucifer of angels that to hym wer bayn. Then to fulfille Ã¾at tent plas mon was made, as clercus sayn, that Lucifer for his trespas thur?e pride lost, nys not to layn. But quen that plas fulfillet is that so was lorn for Lucifer, then shal be domus-day i-wys And general risyng, bout wer. ffor Ã¾at plas, leue wel Ã¾is, may wel be-token, as I say her, the tent order Ã¾at diden omys of angels Ã¾at wer most cler. Also bi six I vnderstonde the sex dedis of charite, Ã¾at forto bryng vs out of bonde God shewide sone, as ?e shyn se. Quich dedis I wil not wonde to reherce, ri?t as did he that with his frelie flesch wold fonde of thraldom forto make vs fre. The first was Ã¾e incarnacioun, the secunde his natiuite, the thrid his gret passioun, the furth quen to helle went he, The fift his resurreccioun, the sext time worshipt wer we qven our kynde atte Asscencioun Abuf alle heuens havcet he. Then sexagesme as I con say endures, qvo-so wel wil seke, ri?t into Ã¾e Wedenesday Ã¾at is in Ã¾e Aster weke, On qvich Wedenesday songen is At Ã¾e bygynnyng of Ã¾e mas this ilke selue offys that I shal specifie er I pas: Venite benedicti patris mei &amp;c, expositio in lingua materna. âMy fadir blesside, comus to me, takes Ã¾e ioy that ordeynt is to owe, er made was stone or tre, In heuen Ã¾er-as is endles blis,â So that, âwel done,â Ã¾is shul Ã¾ai her And vsen Ã¾es wercus of mercy, âwelcum to my fadir dere,â As in Latyn now saide I. Then heuen ?ates shul openyd be that spouse to spouse may com Ã¾at way, holi chirche, as er saide we, to Crist as hit was wilnet ay. Therfore we reden ?e moun se In Ã¾e epistle of Ã¾is Sonday, in tribulacioun stif to be And suffre as Paule did, soth to say: Ad Corinthios Paulus: Libenter suffertis insipientes &amp;c. And in the gospel eke also to gode dedis we counseiled bene, worthy to God that we be tho And make Ã¾is saide, as may be sene: venite benedicti patris mei. then holi chirche Ã¾at saide bifore the first Sonday at mas this offys, dredyng wonder sore As ho in tribulacioun was: Circumdederunt me gemitus mortis. this secunde Sonday comfortid is, And praies to Crist in this manere, that he wil rise Ã¾at kyng of blis weret fro wo Ã¾en Ã¾at Ã¾ai wer: Officium: Exurge, quare obdormis domine. But in thre maners, as I fynde, And for thre thinges, in gode fay, holy chirch vs to vnbynde by this offys wel moun pray: Exurge &amp;c. ffor sum in holi chirch Ã¾er bene that han gret tribulacioun And neuer ouer-comen, as wel is sene, ffor no maner temptacioun. And for alle sich as moun do so this offys songen is oright to comfort hom in sich wo And make hor langour more li?t. Other ther ben als, in gode fay, that gret tribulacioun han, but suffre hit moun Ã¾ai by no way, but in hit ca?t &amp; sone tan. And for alle sich it nedis i-wys to syng Ã¾is offys exurge, to make hom rise Ã¾at don omys In fondyng sone so faynt to be. The thrid Ã¾er ben, as rede I, that ben not fondet with no wo, ne ffallen not in no maner ny but perseueraunt ay ben so. And for alle sich Ã¾is ilke offys Exurge songen is oright, to haue perseueraunce, as best is, In gode purpos Ã¾at Ã¾ai ben pi?t. And to Ã¾es degres thre Acordes Ã¾e gospel of Ã¾is day, that Crist expovnes, ?e moun se, hym-self expresly, soth to say. De quinquagesima &amp; eius institucione. Qvinquagesme is enduryng from Ã¾at ilk Sononday that we thys office conun syng that her wreton is verray: Esto michi in deum protectorem And be trw of-cowntyng hit endes opon Ester day. whi hyt was ordenyt and what thyng, now expressele wol I say. Instituta est quinquagesima propter supplecionem, significacionem &amp; representacionem. Ordenyt hyt was in fulfyllyng on Sonundayes when we mounot faste, And also in bytocunny[n]g of for-?yfnys at the last, The thrid in representyng of serten thyngws don by-fore, as I wol sone to our lykyng de-clar the mater las and mor. Primo propter supplecionem. The first cause wher-for and whi quinquagesme ordynet was, for forty dayes contynwely Crist fast, as gospel mynd mas, Whiche fastyng fullily we schulde fulfyl whit hert fre, and teche our fles so truly on vrthe wonnyng as dyd he. And in al lentun securly but syx and threfte dayes ben for-to fast [o]n conablee, exceptyng Sonundayes, wel ?e senne. ffor of Sonundayes fast not we ffor dyuerse cause, ?e whyt moun. on ys for reuerens, leue ?e me, of Cristes resurection, And sethyn twyes Crist ete that day, as wyttenes the ewangyly,â ones when he come in fay, the ?ates stoken wel and styfley, To hys desypulles, sothe to say, when thay profreden hert-ly rostyt fysche in gode aray, and oney, also as rede I, The secund tyme that day ete he toward Emaus as he went,â ther-fore on Sonunday fast not we ensawmpul of Crist thas so ws kent. Ther-fore to fulfylle by reson fawrty dayes of fastyng, fawr dayes byfore clene lenton we fastun in dayes fullefullyng, And in recompensacion of Sonundayes in that tyme comyng, In the whiche we eten moun twye lefully whyt-out synnyng. But ?et men of religion two dayes by-for askewedenysday by gode consyderacion fastun in maner I schal say, For sythyn hor ordir and degre passes the popul in on maner, hor perfeccioun, leue ?e me, most be schwes more cler. thws one weke by-for lenton Of fastyng fully ordenyt is, and quinquagesme by gode reson cald hyt is nothyng amys. Secundo institucia est quinquagesna propter significacionem. On anothyr cause I myn whi quinquagesme ordenyt was, in tokenyng of our synne was playn remission and grace, ffor al-way the fyfty ?ere has ben ?er of iubile, that al men bounden in daunger weren releschet and maad fre, Also who-ser in dette wer for-?iuen thenne was he, or taken as for prisoner deliueret wel in vch degre, So that of synne if we be cler thurgh schrift and in ful charite, from the deuel and his power thys tyme forboght that we schun be. Qualiter annus iubeleus primo fuerat introductus. Petrus in Historiis Scolasticis. Now er that I fur go I wyl tel what ys iubile, as Ierom and Petre both two witnessen, as rede we. when Abraham, as I sayd bifore, hade slayne faur kenges graciousely And deliueret las and more Loth and al hys company, By-cause of that deliueraunce Iubile toke a bygynyng, whein Habraham felle that happy chaunce his brother out of bale to bryng. Iobel enim dicatur remissio vel inicium. Iubile is as miche to say as remissioun or bygynnyng, for grete remission felle that day as Lothes so a?ayn comyng. Alia causa quare annus iubileus fuerat introductus. And als Loth that taken was and broght a?ayn in this maner was thenne, as boke mynde mas, of elde fully fyfte ?er. Alia causa. Or elles one cause wel migh be for fyfty ?er ful passes wer after that God spake, leue ?e me, whit Habraham hys derlyng der, And bad hym go out of hys contre to a lond he couth hy[m] lere, in whiche reches he had gret plente, and also childer both in fer. Vnde habetur Genesis xij?: Egredere de terra tua, &amp; de cognacione tua, &amp; veni in terram, quam monstrabo tibi. And other cause assingnes is Whi thay worschypet iubile, By-cause Abraham couthe wys of sterres cource grete sotilte, And by-cause that he segh this, that elamentes so distempre in fyfty ?er nothyng amys to esy cource schuld turnet be, Ther-fore in the fyfty ?er he wold schulde be a ?er of grace, and euer sythynne whyt-outen wer contynuely mon vset has. Tercia racio est quare quinquagesima est instituta propter representacionem. The thryde cause by myn entent whi quinquagesme ordeynet was as wel was forto represent thyng done byfore as tyme of grace. for as I sayd right now byfore, bonde-men in the fyfty ?er wer made fre, as was vset ?ore, And that tyme put out of daunger. Also in the fyfty day after the lombe sacret was, the lawe to Moyses, leue ?e may, was ?iuen thenne thurght Goddes grace. But more expresse this story of the lombes offering the thryde book rede he, rede I, And ther shal he fynde thys thyng, Wo-ser wol fynde fullily hys purpos to gode ligkyng, [loke wele &amp; certaynly due linee absunt. And in Ã¾at boke he shal fynde Ã¾at Ã¾ynge.] Al-so the fyfty day i-wys from Cristes resurection, the Holy Gost from heuen blysse to erthe for mon was sent doun, Therfore thys noumbur of fyfty blesset dedes may represent, As I bifore con specify And thaght ow her be myn entent. Nota quod tria sunt necessaria que proponuntur in epistola &amp; in euangilio huius diei. Thre nedeful thyngus, takes in mynde, that in the epistel bene to-day and in the gospel, as I fynde, that preuen penaunce nedeful ay. The furst of hom is charite, that in the epistel expresset is, and thus bygynnes, ?e moun se, as her is written wel i-wys. Si linguis hominum loquar, &amp; angilorum, caritatem autem non habeam, factus sum velut es &amp;c. Paule says thagh he had that grace to speke as aungel and as mon, and charite failet in that caas, vertu fynd he ne con, Saue as metal that wer sounyng that turnet no more p[ro]fyt to, or as a chymbe began to tyng, no more gode ther-whit might he do; And Ã¾at he had grace of prophecy, and couth al maner wordly wyt, and bileuet stidfastly that he mighe make hulles to flytte, And failet that vertu of charite, he says that no-thin[g] worth he wer, and mo suche poyntes puttes he in his epistel, as ?e moun ler. Secundum est memoria passionis, ut in principio euangelii huius diei. In the gospel eke al-so hit mynnes on Cristes passioun to excite monnes wille tho to penaunce and contricion, And ys sette at bigyn[n]yng in the selue ewangely, as I in Latyn schal ou myng, how Ihesu spake in prophecy:â Ecce ascendimus Ierosolima &amp;c. Criste sayde to Ierusalem goynng, âlo now we gone to that cite, fulfyllet sal be althing of prophetes spoken bifor of me.â Whit folk he sayd he schuld be hent, scornet, scourget, sputte opon, and when he wer schamely schent, after slayne bothe God and mon; But rise he wolde the thrydde day, as he tolde hym-selfe byfore, so by thys gospel, I may say, mynde of hys passion meues more A mon to penaunce and to pray for-?iuenesse that he s[ynn]et sore and after by contrite verray, thenne any leson other lore. Tercium est fydes que intelligitur per illuminacionem ceci, vt in euangelio huius diei. The thridde thing that nedeful ys to make our penaunce acceptable ys werrai faithe forsothe i-wisse, for boute hit moun we noght be able. And that may vnderstonden be by the gospel of this day, and that blind mon Ã¾at God maad se, for sad faithe he hade and werray, And that witnesse God almight by his awne worde i-wisse, that Crist sayde when he gaf him sight, as her in Latyn wreten his: Respice, fides tua saluum te fecit. âSe,â quod Crist, and thenne segh he, that long tyme was blind before, âthi beleue has sauet the Of penaunce thow has tholet tho.â So may I preue tho werkes thre that in epistel and gospel ys, faithe, mynd and ful charite bien ful nedeful all i-wis. for sad faithe maad our werkes be acceptable to God almight, For imposseble, leue ?e me, boute faithe to plese God oright. Sine fide impossibile est placere deo. Mind, as in Cristes passioun, makes our penaunce more light, as Gregori witnesse by resoun, and I to telle now haue i-tight: Gregorius: Si passio Christi ad memoriam reducitur, nichil est, quod non equo animo toleretur. â?if Cristes passioun be in mynde, no pyne for him we thole may that [n]is light, ?if we be kynd, and better suffer hit we mone aye.â The thridde vertu of charite mas tho other studfast aye, for ther-as thing may louet be, mon nys not werry be no waye, And witnesse saynt Gregore, As I to specify am in-tent, that loue is noght wurth witerlye, Ther loue in dede ys negligent. Gregorius: Amor dei non potest esse ociosus, operatur enim magna, si est, si autem operari necgligitur, amor non est. Also be good skil preue I may that the office of the masse these thre weeks vche Sonunday grouing to grace all-waye was. for atte furst begynnyng, Circumdederunt singun we, As holi chirch wer mysleuyng Ã¾at any grace of syn shuld be; but the next Sonnenday comming comfortet more sum-what wer we, and i[n] hope of grace prayng wit this office, Exurge, In whice we prayn to God, rise and noght for-sake vs in grete nede, and we als waxen more wyse that misbileueden in our dede; but now this thridde Sonnodaye as men that comfortet ben oright [For he ys our governour ever &amp; ay As hit ys in Ã¾e office dyght.] Officium misse: Esse michi domine in deum protectorem. In whice office, sothe to say, holy chirche to God almight four thinges special con pray, as I to telle now haue i-tight. Protectioun and confermyng, of four thes arn the furst two, helpe also and good ledyng, We prayen aftere eke also. for alle men in erthe leuyng, outher Ã¾ai bien wele other wo, grace or gult, wit-oute lesing, one of the faur gos no mon fro. Thenne for suche as ben in grace he praes of confirmacioun for to kepe hym fro trespas and falling by temptacioun. Officio misse huius diei: Quoniam firmamentum. to hom that bien in gult of synne he prayes of helpe to rise in hye and of the deueles bond to twinne, as this office con specifye. Vt patet in officio: Et in locum ref[u]gii vt saluum me facias. To hom that tholen aduersite he prayes afture protectioun, that God bring hom into prosperite oute of hor persecucioun. Vnde in officio: Esto michi in deum protectorem. ffor mony men so wel [Ã¾a]y bien that hom-self ne know thai noght, ny that ioy conen tha[i] not sen ho[w] godely God for hom has wroght; Therfore to pray aftur ledyng to hom that bene in suche blysse, I holde hit a ful nedeful thing, lest thai gout of the waye amysse. then quinquagesme, as I [s]a[i]de her, endes opoun Aster-daye, for then we risen clene and cler thurgh penaunce done befor in faye. De quadragesima &amp; eius institucione. Of quadragesme now speke we, that clene lentoun callet ys, and diuerse causes ?e schun se whi we worschipen hit i-wis. Quadragesme, as knouen ?e, begynnes that Sonday, not amys, that at masse Inuocauit me Ys sungun welle for the office, and taken hit his ful skilfully, as I thenke now for to saye, for by hit semes that mercy grauntet is fully in fay. For holy chirche at begynnyng opon the furst Sonnenday Circumdederunt conen syng In tribulacioun and afraye, The secounde Sonneday vppe rising Exurge ful welle songen thai, the thridde whit ful hope prayng Esto michi to Goddes paye. now holy chirche showes expresse graciousely that herd is he and broght of wo and grete tr[is]t[e]sse be this song, Inuocauit me. Now wol I that ?e knowen this, that in lentoun sicurly two and fourty dayes ther is whit the Sonnedayes, as say I, Of whiche novmber to take away Sixe Sonnodayes hit enduring, sixe and thritte dayes in fay Leuen that tyme of fasting, the whiche sexe and thritte dayes arn teythe dayes of all the ?er, good accompt who-seuer arayes schal finde hit so wit-outen wer. For thre hundret dayes i-wis and therto fiue and sixtye in a ?ere fulle ther is, and teythe of tho, sixe and therty. But bycause that God al-might fast fourte dayes fullilye, therfore four be-iiij oright we fasten to make ful fourty, That is on Askewednesdaye and the thre dayes aftur hit, to folowe Cristes fasting aye in novmbur of dayes thurgh our witte. Quare in hoc numero quadragenario ieiunium obseruamus, triplex racio assignatur. Now wol I telle wherfore and whi fourty dayes fasten we, th[r]e causes here apertelye I finde be good autorite. the furst cause says saint Austyn whi fourte dayes fasten we ny no mo ny ther-withynne, But euen fourty, ?e schun se. Matheu in his euangely from Abraham til Crist comen was Generacions euen fourty He settes, as book, mynd maas, And fro Crist light in-to mon-kynde in fourty generacioun vs of bale to vnbynde And to blis make vs boun, Right as he that tyme doun light vs to deliuer in-to lee out of pyne [we] wer in pyght Thurgh dethe opon the rode tre, So that tyme we shul us dyght thurght good life wit him to be, and a?ayn oure foo to fight, that maad us bonde that furst wer fre. Secunda causa quare in hoc quadragenario ieiunium obseruamus. The secounde cause is, as says he, for in this generacioun that fourtit is, traual most we, Her we come to perfectioun, and alle our lif in penaunce be in this tyme of redempcioun, that gos be fourte, ?e mone se, in whiche felle our saluacioun. ffor al-thagh God vs so forboght in this tyme goyng be fourty, he wol not Ã¾at we haue for noght that blis that he con for vs bye, But we trauail in dede and thoght for to serue hym princepally, that suche wele so for vs wroght and so ouercome oure enemy. Also Ihesu heuen kenge afture his resurrectioun was fourty dayes her dwelling er he to blisse maad hym boun, Whiche dwellyng [b]e-liken I may to the fourty generacion, in whiche forboght we ben for ay to sekernesse of saluacioun. Terciam causam assignat magister Prepositiuus in Summa. The thridde cause, I wol how say, but I pray ow takes entent, whi this tyme is in penaunce ay fourty dayes, ?e schun be kent. Quatuor partes hominum. The worlde, [?]e witten, dalt hit ys in four parties, leue ?e me, and a ?er also i-wys in four parties, ?e moun se. And mon of four element? maad, fuyr and aire, water and stone, for stone of erthe bygynnyng hade, stone and erthe I holde bothe one. And mon also made ys oright of four complexiones couenable, of sanguine, colre, ys vche wight, fflum, or elles malencoly. The new lawe also ys sette in four ewangilistes lore, so bi four withouten lette gone alle the thinges sayde bifore. Also by ten comondement? the olde lawe wel ordeynet was, and to bothe lawes with grete offense oft tyme we doon trespasse. Ther-fore to bothe amende most be, ?if we to blisse woln be worthy, bi ten sithe four, as ?e schun se, and four sithe ten, as telle wol I. Takes hede now, I ow pray, to vnderstond this thing oright, by noumbre of ten, as I ?ow say, the olde lawe to vs was dy?t, The newe lawe god &amp; verray by faur ewangeliste? lore, so by faure &amp; ten our fay ys schewet frely vs byfore. faur sith ten that is faurty, &amp; ten sith faur faurty also, so noumbre of ten to multiplie faur is set to, may not be fro. And so by noumbre of ten i-wis the olde lawe ?iuen to vs was, &amp; now confermet wel hit is By noumbre of faur in tyme of grace. Therfore sithen that we don amys a?ain both lawe? to trespasse, skilful thing is, me thinkes this, to both amend vs in this cas, And by noumbre of faur and ten, syn faur syth ten makes faurty, amend vs knelyng on our knen faurty dayes to aske mercy. Also, as I said byfore, of faur elements made is mon, wheche faure by clerkes lore han places in him to leng opon. For in oure eghen fuyr ther is, in tong and eres aire wol fall, in priue membres water i-wis, erthe in hondes &amp; limmes all. In eghen therfore is bysenes, for fuyr ther most abundaunt is; in tong and eres wrecchednesse, ther-as aire maisters vs amys; In priue membres lecchery, ther-as water has wonyng; in hondes and alle lymmes by crueschip of erthe comyng. Therfore sithen we of such mater byn mad, in which synne is regnyng, and gon by faur, ?e sene wel here, me thing that hit is skilful thing By faur sith ten we punischet be of thing that we han don amys, syn old lawe &amp; newe, ?e moun se, by ten &amp; faur fulfillet is. Gregorius in omelia ponit alias tres rationes. Sayn Gregory in his omely schowes thes skilles that I shal say, whi faurty daies continuely we fasten byfore Pasche daie. For the ten commandements &amp; the vertue of hom commynge shuld be fulfillet bout offence by newe lawe in all thing. Faur bokes of the ewangely confirmen all thing don bifore in the old lawe, as say I, that laft was vs by Moise? lore. ffor nouther lawe ne profecye vset in the old testament was neuer fulfillet fullily til Crist com and hit vs kent. Now sithen in flesche that dedely is our soule lenges, as wetten ?e, the whiche fleschely body i-wys of four elamentes made ys he, And by that fleschely wylfulnesse Goddes byddyng breken we, ther-fore that flesche for to distresse gode resoun ys, as thinkes me. Sithen old lawe gos by ten the new by four, as wreten ys hit, by faur sithe ten to punische men me think hit wel done by my wyt, And faurty dayes for to fast, syn four sythe ten euen fourty ys, thus four and ten by my cast ys sette togeder wel i-wys. And from this day to Pasche day six wikes ther bene &amp; no mo, &amp; in the six wikes ay euen faurty daies and two, Of the whech take away six Sonnendayes, at comptyng so, in abstinence ther leues, I lay, six &amp; thritte daies tho. Then contenes all the ?ere thre hundret daies fyue &amp; sixte, &amp; teithe of th[o], withouten were, is sixt &amp; thritte, as said I. Thus teith we our flesche in fer to God be dayes deuoutely, as witnesse Goddes derlyng der, the holi pope sain Gregori. Quare non obseruamus ieiunium eo tempore quo Christus ieiunauit. Magister Iohannes Beleth. Now is to knowe a nedefull thing to which I rede ow take gode hede, whi we hold not oure fastyng that tyme that Crist did, as was nede. For Crist, as I haue told by-fore, was folowet opon the twolft daie, when he of elde was bout more bygynning thritte ?er in fai, Then his fasting began he of faurty daies, as I fynd, faur skilles whi so don not we schowe I wil whil I haue mynde. Prima causa. Magister Iohannes Beleth. A gret clerk, that callet is Iohn Beleth, as rede I, thes causes schewes not amys, is gode to haue in memorie. â?if we wilne,â he sais, âto rise with Ihesu Crist at his rising, fonde we for to make vs hise with holi dedes of fasting. âFor sithen Crist suffret passioun er he rose the thrid daie, skil hit is &amp; gode raisoun we souffre so before in faye, âThat we to rise moun be bovn with him that tyme worthily ay, clene bout any corrupcioun &amp; wemme of synne clene put away.â Secunda causa. Item Iohannes Beleth. The secund cause, as says he, for Iues agayn hom bro?t were from Egipt lond in-to Iude this selfe tyme &amp; all in fere Be Moise? seruand Iosue, as in Exodi ?e moun lere, this ilk chapetre that wol se that is titlet holly here. Exodi xiiij? Also eft when thai were tan &amp; in Babiloin bro?t in bond, this tyme turnet a?ain thai han with grete ioye to hor awne lond, &amp; that schewus apertely by euidence gode and expresse, for ri?t when thai were commen in hie, Pasche day with hom worshipt was. Therfore to do as dyden thai, the clerk sais, skilful thing hit is this tyme to fas?t, in gode fay, &amp; mend that we han don amys, That we moun opon Astur-day from Egipt, Babiloin both i-wis, be deliueret faire away o bondaghe in-to mych blys, That is to wit, from worldus woo &amp; the dewlus knot of synne to that ioy that laste? oo, of heuen blys that neuer shal blyn. Who-seuer this story all wold see of the Iewes a?ayne-comyng from Babiloyne to hor cuntre, in Ester he schal fynd this thyng. Tercia causa. Item Magister Iohannes Beleth. âThe thrid cause,â says Maister Iohan, âgos sumwat by way of kynde, for lechery thys tyme in mon most feruent regnys, as I fynd, âAnd mon has more temptacioun al-way this tyme of the ?er thenne any other, leue ?e moun, groing hete ymong vs her. âTher-fore that fondyng to wiht-stond, that we han so flesche likyng, to fast and pray we mosten fonde this tyme to be in gode tempryng. âThat suche fleschely temptacion bring vs in no mor tene, to suffer assay we this sesoun leste synne on vs to muche be sene.â Quarta causa, statym post ieiunium debemus corpus domini accipere. The furthe cause, in gode fay, opon reson foundet ys, ffor Goddes body we schulden ay receyue clene and not amys, And w[ith] abstenence verray of mete and drinke whit-out fayntys m[e]ke hym-self a mon wel may, and wildeschip so wel wayue i-wys; Ther-fore after suche fastyng, hit semes clene that we schuld be And eke worthi in al thyng to receyue his body fre. And ensaumpul we moun take, as our faderes han vs kent, and as book mynd conen make in the Olde Testament, ffor er thay maken sacrifice of the lompe on Pasche day, thay th[o]ghten, as men that wer wyse pleysaunt be to Goddes pay, And eten erbes Ã¾at bytter wer and honysokles as I say, the wiche abaten in gode maner fleschely lust by al way, That thay might clene and worthi be to sacre that lombe after hor lawe; ensampel of wiche sewen now we, And after hor doyng for to draw, And this tyme pyne vs whit fastyng forto receyue worthily the lombe of lyfe to his liking, that whit his blode so con vs by. De ieiunio quatuor temporum. De ieiunio quatuor temporum. Now of fastyng speke we of four tymes of the ?er, that lewet callen, as witten ?e, vmbring dayes and fasting der, whiche dayes by autorite of Pope Calixt ordenes wer, four tymes four sithe dayes thre, for sertayn cause, as schun her. The furst cause, God hit wotte, for Marche is hote and moyste i-wys, And somer is dry and hote, heruest colde and dry ay is, Wynter colde and moiste also, Hyt ys ay by way of kynde, ther-fore we fasten these tymes oo For these causes, as I fynde. In Marche moyste and hote, say I, We fasten to restreyne oright hote sturing of lechorye, that in that mone as most might. In somer that is dry and hote, We fasten to wayue auerice that thenne ys regnyng, God hyt woote, and men a-bundaunt to that vice. In heruest that is cold and drye, we fasten to a-bate pruyde; in wynter regnes malice, enuye, ther-for we fasten that ilke tyde. ffor vche mon that is lyuyng has part of sum complexion to these tymes acordyng, ther-fore me thynke hit gode resoun To fast tho tymes of the ?er, and from these flesly wylles fle, that of meschef ben grete mater by way of kynde, as ?e moun se. Secunda causa quare quater in anno ieiunamus. The secunde cause qwy fast we these four tymes of the ?er, schillfully may this be, that I thenke to schew her. In Marche ys the forme fastyng In the furst weke of lenton, that holy tyme bygynnyng vices in vs degh moun, ffor sythen that lechery ys spryngyng, that tyme gode ys we make vs boun stifly to be with-stondyng suche fleschely temptacion. Sithen that herbe and eke tre by-gynnes thenne to spryng and sprede, in vertues ther-fore spryng we from syn rising, as I rede. In somer in the witsone weke we fasten eft with gode entent to receyue w[i]th hert meke the Holy Gost that thenne is sent. And ri?t as Ã¾at Gost from aboue In fourme of fuyr to vs is sent, so shyn our hertes in gret luf thur?e sich fastyng be feruent. In Septembre Ã¾e thrid time is that we fasten in this maner, for then fruytes, ?e knowen Ã¾is, gederide ar for al Ã¾e ?er, Ãerfore Ã¾at time to fast &amp; pray that fruytes sauely moun com in, skilful thing it is in fay that God that time on vs wil myn, And fruytes of gode wercus tho moun ?eld to God alweldyng, that sustinaunce sendis for vs so A?ayn wynter then comyng. In December also fasten we the ferth time with deuocioun, quen herbes de?en &amp; lef of tre fades &amp; then falles doun, As to Ã¾e world so shulden we de?e of vices, &amp; make vs boun A?aynus his natiuite, that worthily welcum hym we moun. Tercia causa quare quater in anno ieiunamus ad imitandum iudeos in veteri testamento. The thrid cause of Ã¾is fastyng is forto sewe with gode entent our fadirs dede, as in that thyng of Ã¾e Olde Testament. ffor as we fynden so fastide thay ffour times of Ã¾e ?er; bifore pasches Ã¾e first was ay, And bifore qvitsonday in fere, bifore the fest of cenophegy, And Ã¾e fest of encenny eke; quat ben Ã¾es festes telle wyl I, that ow nede no firre to seke. Pascha, id est transitus, quia tunc Christus transiuit de morte ad vitam, vel Iudei de Egipto per Mare Rubrum ad patriam redierunt. Pasche is as mich to say As goyng a?ayn, as preues this, for Crist from deth on Pasch day to lif turnet with gret blis. Also in boke rede we of Ã¾e Olde Testament, that Iewes a?ayn into Iude form Egipt then wer sent. De ingressu Israel in Egiptum &amp; exitu de Egipto. But how to Egipt comen thay And thai bro?t wer hom a?ayn, er I go firre I wol say, the gret of hit wol do ?ou gayn. In the first boke reden we, that is cald Genesis, that Ioseph sold was for monee Into Egipt al omys, In quich londe rocoueret he thurgh God so mych blis, that thurgh Ã¾ere kyng of his meyne most maister he was i-wys. So felle of hunger seuen ?er thur?e-out that londe continuely, that Iosephes breÃ¾er comen in fer At hym liflode forto by. And so, shortly forto telle, Iacob Ã¾e fadir was after sent In time of hunger Ã¾er to dwelle, And meyne that with hym wer lent. So lenget thai child after child ful mony ?er, Ã¾at greuet hom sore In daunger, &amp; Ã¾er men wer wilde, and alway daunger more &amp; more. Quat maner sorow soffride thay the text of holi writt wil telle, for ?if I shuld al tell in fay al to long her shuld I dwelle. But atte last, shortly to showe, quen mony veniaunces fallen wer to Kyng Pharao mony way, that gry?t to shutt hom of daunger, With mych blys hom comen thay Into hor cuntre alle in fer, thur?e Goddis my?t a wonder way takes hede &amp; ?e shyn her, ffor the Rede Se hym with-drogh, Goddes peple hom comyng, And men of Egypt drovnet &amp; slogh, that after hom wrangly wer suyng. Then Goddes folk was fayn inogh, And this song thai couthen syng, for Egipt louret &amp; thay logh restoret so to hor likyng. Cantemus domino, gloriose enim magnificatus est. And quen Ã¾ai home thus comen wer, Anon thai maden pasch day euen this selue time of Ã¾e ?er, And we worshipen hit now ay. Therfore, as I tolde now her, pasch as mych is to say As goyng auther fer or ner, As that time so diden thay. And ther pasches hade bygynnyng, quych fest neuer was made bifore, And in mynde of hor hoom-comyng so honuret thai hit euer more. And in that fest to hor offryng A lomb thai toke thur?e Goddes lore, that well mi?t be in tokenyng of Crist, Ã¾at suffrid paynus sore; ffor he is verray lomb of lif that offrid hym-self on rode tre forto stynt the deules strif, And that wer thral to make hom fre, ffrom deth also to lif he went, therfore this fest may callid be goyng, as I haue nowe ow kent, for fro deth to lif ?ode he. De festo pentecostes &amp; quare fuit sic vocatum a Iudeis &amp; primo celebratum. Pentecostes dicitur a penta, quod est quinque, &amp; coste, quod est decem, quia quinquies decem dies erant a die agni immolati vsque ad legem datam, &amp; a resurreccione Christi vsque ad missionem spiritus sancti. Now of Ã¾e secunde solemnite that Iewes maden, as I saide her, And quat pentecost may be, declar I wil in gode maner. Pentecost is as mich to say As fyfe sith ten, for so preue I, for from pasches into Ã¾at day ar fifty daies witerly. And als in Ã¾e Olde Testament from pasch day, as I saide bifore, that Ã¾e lomb with gode entent was offrid of our faders ?ore, Into Ã¾at day of pentecoste, In quych Ã¾e lagh ?yuen was to Moyses that God louede moste, fifty daies fully thow has. ffor the old lagh witerly. to hym in fuyr was ?iuen tho, And in fuyr thur?e his mercy the Holi Gost to vs also. And the fifty day i-wys from pasch day Ã¾e la?e ?yuen was, And the fifty day with blys the Holi Gost was sent thur?e gras. Therfore to make wel acordyng the old la?e &amp; Ã¾e newe in fer, the fifty day, with-out lesyng, And Ã¾e self time of Ã¾e ?er Ihesu Crist our heuen kyng sende his gost doun to his her In fourme of fuyr on hym to myng, As to Moyses in al maner. Thus in Ã¾e mount of Synay was ?yuen the la?e to Moyses tho, the Holi Gost als, nys no nay, In mount Synay eke also. This preues that Ã¾e Holi Gost is verray confirmacioun of both la?es mater most, In quych lys al perfeccioun, So Ã¾at Ã¾e Iewes ?et Ã¾is day, In quat place Ã¾ai ben dwellyng, honouren Ã¾es two festis ay this selue time in alle thing. But one entencioun han thay And we anoÃ¾er in our doyng, ffor thei so honouren pasch day bi-cause of hor a?ayn-comyng, And this fest worshipen we ffor Cristes resurreccioun, ffor from deth Ã¾en turnet he to life for our saluacioun. Witsontide als worship Ã¾ai, for hor la?e was ?yuen hom tho, And we worshipen Ã¾at ilk day for sendyng of his gost also. De festo Scenofegie &amp; qualiter fuerat introductum. Quare apparet Senophegia festum tabernaculorum in memoriam quadraginta Annorum quibus fuerant in deserto. The thrid fest I speke of her that Iewes fastediden so bifore, scenophegy with-outen wer callide it was, is callid ful ?ore, And honourede Ã¾e fiftene day of Septembre monyth ich ?er, And al a seueny?t, nys no nay, thai mensket hit in gode maner. And cause now I shal ?ou say, for sumtime Iewes wer dwellyng fourty ?er from toun away In desert at gret likyng, And then in tentis dwellid thay And with manna fed i-wys, therfore in mynde of this thing ay this fest was honouret with gret blys; And fest of tentis callide it was, for certeyn wonyng hade thei non, but tentis pi?ten in diuerse plas, As men that ay wer boun to gone. De quarto festo vocato encennia niorum. The furth fest thei fast bifore, Encennia hit callide was, ffor temple halowyng &amp; no more this name skilfully hit has. And, as Ierom makes mynde, the Iewes temple was halowet thrye, enes in Septembre, as I fynde, by Salomon kyng solempnely. Eft quen Ã¾e Iewes comen wer from Babyloyn out of bandoun, halowide it was, as I say her, In March with gret deuocioun. the thrid time halowet was hit, quen Antiochus Ã¾e grete kyng defoulide hit &amp; Iewis flitt with mavmetry Ã¾er-in dwellyng. Iudas Machabeus tho halowide then hit, as I ?ou say, In Decembre, after sich wo euen Ã¾e fyue &amp; thritty day, And that halowyng vset was In Cristes time, as rede we, and as sayn Ion her mynde mas by this clause, as ?e moun se: Iohannes x: ffacta sunt Encennia in Ierusolimis, &amp; yemps erat. therfore to sewe our faders dede that four sith fasten in this maner, therfore four sith hit is nede we fasten, that now lyuen her. Quinta ratio quare quatuor in anno ieiunamus. Ieronimus &amp; Iohannes Damascenus. The fift cause qvy fasten we four times of Ã¾e ?er, wel &amp; skilfully may be for Ã¾is skil, Ã¾at ?e shyn [her]. ffor mon, as I saide now ri?t, of four complexions made is, of sanguine, colrie, is iche wight, malencolie or fleme i-wys. sanguine in March has most my?t to meue mon to do amys, Colre in somer day &amp; ny?t maistres then qver-so he is, In heruest malencoly regnyng, In wynter fleme, I saide bifore, And of alle thes ich mon lyuyng has sumquat, ouÃ¾er las oÃ¾er more. Therfore in Marche fasten we sanguine stifly to with-stonde And fleschly wille, for cause is he of leccherie in iche londe, ffor qvo-so most is made of hit, lecchourous &amp; li?tsum is, therfore to wayfe that be our wit this time we fasten wel i-wys. In somer we fasten forto qvace colre that then aboundaunt is, for qvo-so most of hit has, wrawes &amp; treccherous is i-wys; Therfore in somer fasten we quen that colre is regnyng, sich mys-mater, leue ?e me, stifly to be with-stondyng. In heruest fast we, as Ã¾e wise, forto ouer-come skilfully Malencoly &amp; couetise, that in that time has maistry, ffor qvo-so most of hit has, coueytous he is kyndly, And mournyng, as boke mynde mas, that Isidre writes witerly. In wynter fleme, as I fynde, is aboundaunt most kene, ffor then water &amp; eke wynde is most violent, bout wene, And thai Ã¾at most han of Ã¾at kynde, slawe Ã¾ai ben, as oft is sene, And maset also in hor mynde, of Ã¾at complexioun Ã¾at bene. Therfore Ã¾at mater forto qvace, we fasten Ã¾at time of Ã¾e ?er, thus four complexiouns Ã¾ow has forto with-stonde in gode maner. Sexta ratio, quoniam ver comparatur aeri, estas igni, autumpnus terre, hiemps aque. The sext cause may wel be for March time liknet is to Ã¾e air, as reden we, somer to fuyr, nothing amys, heruest to Ã¾e erth her, wynter to water witerly, And to Ã¾es times of Ã¾e ?er four complexiouns lykken I. Therfore in Marche we fasten ay that in March may ouer-comen be Aire of pride to Goddis pay, sithen Ã¾at in vs so maistres he. In somer fasten we also that fuyr &amp; hete &amp; couetise may be exteynt, &amp; sich wo wayuet wel to make vs wise. In heruest is Ã¾e thrid fastyng, erth &amp; cold to put away, of priuey malice in hert dwellyng to Ã¾at complexioun acordyng ay. In wynter fastyng ordeynt wes to putt li?tship out of mynde, And water of vnstidfastnes Acordyng to Ã¾at, as I fynde. Septima ratio, quoniam ver refertur Ad puericiam, estas ad adolescenciam, Autumpnus ad maturitatem, yems ad senectutem. The seuent cause, as clercus sayn, qvy we thus fasten may wel be, for March is liknet, is no?t to layn, to childhede wel, as reden we. Somer to ?outh liknet is, that gro?yng time is cald expres, heruest to monnes eld i-wys, in whiche is kyndle soburnes, Winter to elde wihthouten wer is likenet to wel and skilfully, wen mon is passit sixty ?er, in four our lif thus diuise I. In Marche therfore fasten we ay that we moun verray childer be by innocentschip, as I say, and clannes of lyf, leue ?e me. In somer faste we, in gode fay, that w[e] moun ?ong be of pouste, alle vices to putte away thurgh studfastenesse in that degre. In heruest fast we witterly to be sober and meke also, as to mon falles couenable when ?outh and wildschip is ago. In winter fasten we boute faynyng, to be old and wise i-wys by holy dedes and gode lyuyng, as that clerkes leues this, Or to amende by suche fastyng that we han done byfore amys, in tho eldees God despising so to amende vs gode hit is. Octaua racio. Magister Willelmus Altissiodorensis &amp; Ieronimus. The eght cause schowes expresse tho clerkes in Latyn alleget her. for to amende by suche gode-nesse our gultyng four tyme[s] of the ?er, And our fasting dayes thre, Wednsday, Fryday, and Setterday, ffor Wednesse-day solde was, reden we, Crist to the Iewes, in gode fay, On Friday deghet he on the tre; Setter-day in sepultre lay, for sorowe of moder and his meisne that day we fasten, sothe to say. De imperatoribus. Martinus. Anno gracie xvj?, Tiberius erectus est in imperatorem post mortem Octouiani. Tiberius was made this ?er emperour after Octouian, and eghten ?er, withouten wer, regnet er that Crist was tane, And after Cristes passion fyue ?er fully regnet he, thas mas in alle, ?e knowe moun, euen twenty ?er and thre. Octouianes wyues sone he was by a husbond ho hade bifore, wise in armes in vche place, and to world happy euermore. In lettrur he was ful cunnyng and wonder slegh als, as I rede, other then wille schop of-scho-wyng, and his wille noght schowe til nede. Mon that he louet, hit was semyng alway wrotht whit as he wer, and to hem that he louet no-thing, made glad contennaunce and gode cher. In al his werkes wel abydyng he was, as Iosephus witenesse her, And as schowde by hys doyng in w[or]lde lyuyng, as ?e moun ler. ffor in what lond, whitoute lesing, that he made any officer, he suffert hom alway so lenging And neuermore chaunget in no maner. And cause whi that so did he, hit was the peple forto spare, men asket what the cause might be, And this was al-way his vnsware: Nam procuratores, inquit, tanto dominantur grauius, quanto breuius. âffor procuratoures and officeres, the lasse wille thay han maistry, the more greuouse bene of maneres hor sugetes forto do any.â And this ensaumple shewet he to make hyt sothe that he con say, of a mon that he con se lay ones woundet in the way, Was bytten with fleghes bitterly, come by a frende and for the best steret these fleghes that diden hym ny for to gete hym better rest. Thenne sayde the seke mon to hym tho, âfrende, thow dos me now grete wogh, the fleghes that thow puttes me fro now thay haden eten inogh, âAnd lasse thay greuet whil thay wer ful; now wol thay, when thow art away, hongrily take sadder pul, and greue more then bifore in fay.â And right so in the selue maner hit fares by officeres i-wys, that hopen to stonde but one ?er nuyen the more and done amys. De nouo vitri temperamento. Ysidorus libro xvj? capitulo. We reden in Rome a mon ther was this emperoures tyme lyuyng, that a temprur founden has to make glas big and eke bowing, As stif as siluer or golde is Or other metal to be wroght; when the emperour herd of this, that mon was sone bi-for hym broght. Whenne he bifore hym come i-wys, the emperour sone at hym soght, whether a[n]y monnes wyt saue hys of that temprur knew oght. And he vnswaret and sayd nay, ther was no mon knewe hy[t] saue he, hym-selfe furst fonde hit in gode fay by fe[r] seching and sotilte. When the emp[er]our knewe thys thing, bad sle hym sone in al maner, for ?if that ilke crafte sulde spring, siluer ne gold noght worthy wer. Anno gracie xix?, Tiberii iiij?. This ?er deghet that c[uo]ynt clerke, Ouide, that exilet was out of Rome for wikket werke in one boke that he mad thenne has, The whiche book was of paramur, al forto teche men for to wow, and broght mony in grete langour for kokewald wer mo thenne i-nowe, And mony ladyes of that cite defoulet thurght hys token tho, the emperesse als defoulet he, and thurgh his token mony mo. Ther-fore from Rome he was exilet in-to the yle of Pounce i-wys, for by hym wymmen wer bigilet and mony made to do amys. Ther-fore an-other book he made was callet of suche loue remedy, to amonde that he done hade and teche wymmen to wayue that ny, In whiche book these verses sette he, that by-ny[t]h[e] arn writen her in Latyn, as ?e wel moun se, that semet he ruet his doyng der: Naso minus prudens artem dum tradit amandi, doctrine pretium triste magister habet. Anno gracie xxvij?, Tiberii xij?. This ?er Pilate was after sent and made hegh iustice in Iude, vnder whom toke iuggemynt Ihesu Crist to deth on tre. But of his burthe and byggynynge loke her-after and knowe ?e moun, and also wayte of his endyng in Ihesu Cristes passion. Of Iudas also, sothe [to] say, thowe sal fynde in the selue place, and how Ierusalem rede thow may thurgh vengeaunce after destruet was. Anno gracie xxx? &amp; Tiberii xvij?. Iohan the Baptist this selue ?er bigan to preche al in Iude, bapti?et also fer and ner, and tolde that forgoer was he to Ihesu Crist, Ã¾at Marie ber, And baptist hym, as reden we, the e?t Ide of Ianuer, twelfe daies from his natiuite, that fel Ã¾en as a Sononday, And Monday after next suyng lad to desert, Ã¾at nys no nay, Of fourty daies bigan fastyng. With Ã¾e Holi Gost lad was he Into desert, as sais Gregory In his 5 Omelie, leue ?e me, And with non eul gost witerly. When he had fourty daies fast After Ã¾e time he baptist was, the deul temptide hym atte last, As the gospelle mynde mas. but Crist for alle Ã¾e deulis cast ouer-come hym wel tho in Ã¾at cas, for he supplauntide long time past our forme fadir out of his plas. But thagh Adam ouer-comen wer &amp; laft Ã¾e ioy of Paradise thur?e Ã¾e deul &amp; his power, that so ouer-come hym by coyntise, He that was God &amp; mon in fer restoret hym that was warre &amp; wys I shal ?ou tell in quat maner, As Gregory sais with-out fayntis. The deul temptide vntrewly our forme fadir al amys with thre synnus, sais Gregory, forto bryng hym out of blis. The first of hom was glotery, the secunde vaynglorie i-wys, the thrid auarise, as say I, thur?e quych Ã¾e deul then made hym his. With glotery he bigilet hym tho quen Ã¾at he shewide hym the tre And the fruyt of hit also that swete &amp; fair was forto se, With vayn-glorie he did hym wo quen he hi?t hom both to be like goddes, Ã¾er-as wer no mo but one God &amp; persouns thre. Eritis sicut dii. Genesis. In auarise thay temptide wer quen Ã¾at he het hom forto knawe gode &amp; eul both in fer by this word, Ã¾at I shal showe: Genesis, eodem capitulo: Scientes bonum &amp; malum. âAuarise,â sais sayn Gregory, âsovnes not onely in monee, but in he?enes witerly And couetise of gret degre;â ffor [qven] mon wilnes gret maistry of he?enes or of dignite, Gregory in his omely sais that couetouse is he. Thus gilet Sathan sotily Adam foul by synnus thre, And supposide wel Ã¾er-by haf combride Crist, so leue ?e me, And tho wiles euerychone Assaide on Crist Ã¾at ilk day, thur?e glotery first to be his fone this ilke worde quen he con say: Si filius dei es, dic vt lapides isti fiant. â?if Ã¾ou be Goddis sone,â saide he, âmake of thes stones brede in hie.â ther temptid he hym, ?e may wel se, ri?t as Adam in glotery. But Crist knewe wel his sotiltie, And saide that mon lifd not only by brede, but Goddes word most be saule sustinauns sikerly. Non in solo pane viuit homo set in omni verbo quod procedit de ore dei. Then was the deul adred ful sore, ffor atte forme ouer-comen was he, but ?et he tho?t to fonde hym more the secunde time, as ?e shyn se. And temptid hym bi vayn-glory qven he Ã¾is word saide writen her, â?if Ã¾ow be Goddes son almy?ty, come doun &amp; in Ã¾is plas apper.â Si filius dei es, mitte te deorsum. Then Crist concludet hym with cumfort and holi writt alegget Ã¾er, âwriten hit is Ã¾at God thi lord thow shalt not fonde but honour &amp; her.â Non temptabis dominum deum tuum. the thrid time he temptid wes by auarise, &amp; then was thrie quen he showide hym expres al Ã¾e world Ã¾er oponlye, And saide, âal this I wil ?if Ã¾e, ?if Ã¾ow wilt mekly knele adoun And with gode wille worship me, thou shalt hafe al this tour &amp; toun.â Hec omnia dabo tibi, si cadens adoraueris me. then [t]o the deul onsuaride he with a fulle conclusioun, âGod thi lord byhoues the to honour &amp; serue, be alway boun.â Dominum deum tuum adorabis, &amp; illi soli seruies. Al thus in Ã¾is selue maner, And bi Ã¾es sleghtes alle thre that Adam bro?t was in daunger, Crist ouercome Sathan, ?e moun se. De miraculo Christi &amp; apostolorum vocacione. After Ã¾at Crist thus fulghet was Ã¾e e?t Ide of Ianuer, And fulfillid his fastyng has ffourty dais, as I saide her, The next pasches after Ã¾en suyng to Ã¾e temple come he in hye, And men Ã¾er sellyng &amp; bying putt hom out apertly, And saide his fadir wonyng shuld not be hous of marchandye. the self ?er, bout lesyng, Crist cald to hym this company, Peter &amp; Andrewe eke also, Philip &amp; Natanaele, that he ches with hym forto go from worldes woo to saule hele. The next ?er after, as rede I, Crist turnet water into wyne the self day of epiphany, As in his cronicles sais Martyn. And after that sone, as I rede, Crist &amp; his chosen meigne baptiseden, as witnesses Bede, mich peple in Iudee. The next pasch Ã¾en suyng Ion Ã¾e baptist prisonet was ffor his fulghing &amp; preching, And one ?er ful was in Ã¾at plas. And on that selue pasch day And Iewes saboth sikerly, helet Ihesu, soth to say, A mon Ã¾at hade Ã¾e parlesy Biside a fisch-pole, nys no nay, As specifies Ã¾e euangely, that aght &amp; thritty ?er so lay In that seknes with gret any. And after that Ã¾e selue ?er, Crist into a hulle he went, And ther he ches men to hym der, his twelue apostlis, &amp; hom kent. And Luk witnes bout wer Bertilmewe &amp; Thomas of Inde wer that time chosen both in fer, And to preche sent, as I fynde. Then after Ã¾e thrid pasch day Ion Ã¾e baptist hedet was, after a fulle ?er, in gode fay, Ãat he was prisonet in that plas. In Ã¾e epiphany nex tho God showide a miracle ful apert, quen with fiue loues &amp; fisches two he fed fyue thousande in desert.

And erth-qvake was so violent that cites mony wer shaken doun, And roches also al to-rent, As writen is in Ã¾e passioun. Petre scisse sunt &amp;c. Ex quinque vt patet passio Christi fuit ex dolore amar[a], ex illusione despecta, &amp; vtilitate multiplici fructuosa, et dolor causabatur. Cristes passioun, heuen kyng, of sorow bitter was &amp; breme, dispitouse also bi scornyng, to deth quen thai hym so con deme, but ?et hit was for mony a thing nedful, fruytful vs to wheme, for his langour wan vs likyng, And forto lagh Ã¾at er con reme. ffyue causes I fynde, in gode fay, qvi Cristes sorowe more shuld be then euer was any, soth to say, the first of hom now ?e shyn se. Prima causa doloris, quia ignominiosa. ffor his passioun shameful was, for shameful stid hit was don in, At Caluarie, Ã¾er-as was plas to punysch gulty for hor syn. Also his deth was shameful eke And sclaunderouse in cite &amp; shire, for hym Ã¾ai dampnet that was so meke to foulist deth thay mi?t conspir. Quia morte turpissima condempnatus est. ffor the croys was ordeynt then to heng on thef &amp; trespasour, tha?e hit to now be knelide on knen And worshipide with so gret honour. Vnde Augustinus: Crux, que erat supplicium latronum, nunc transit ad frontes imperatorum. Therfore Austyn witnes Ã¾is, âthe croys that er was theues wo on emperoures hedes sette is, And in world now worshippide so.â Sithen God ordeynt so Ã¾erfore sich honour for he henget Ã¾er-on, hit semus he ordeynt mich more In heuen of ioy &amp; blis for mon, As he did for hym that was wys, that thef Ã¾at leuet on his lore, that he se[n]de first to Paradys bifore alle sayntes Ã¾at wer bifore. therfore sais Ã¾e prophecy with wiccut men wo suffrid he, And theues that diden gret any honget by hym on rode tre. Et cum iniquis deputatus est. But ?et Ã¾at one Ã¾er sauet was for his bileue &amp; repentaunce, that oÃ¾er of hom hade no gras to ask mercy in his penaunce. Therfore sais Austyn openly quat testament made Crist on croys, qvich word now reherce wil I, that spoken wer with delful voys. Testamentum Christi in cruce, Augustinus: Auctor ipse pietatis in cruce pendens in secularibus negociis pietatis officia diuidebat, persecucionem apostolis, pacem discipulis, corpus Iudeis, patri spiritum, virgini paranimphum, latroni paradisum, peccatoribus infernum, crucem christianis penitentibus commendabat. Crist, Auctor &amp; prince of pite, Nota bene testamentum Christi. hengyng on croice for monnus syn, for hor nedis Ã¾us ordeynt he his testament, quen he wold twyn. Apostles persecucioun, disciples pes assignet he, his body Ã¾er al redy boun to Iewes that nailed hym on tre; His gost to his fadir he sent, And to his moder, swete Mary, A loker forto take entent to hir then in that gret any; To Ã¾e thef Ã¾at Ã¾er was lent That mercy asket mekely to Paradise he con present, that oÃ¾er to helle went in hy; And helle to synful men ?af he, that to amende wer not in wille, With-out ende Ã¾er forto be, His hest for thay wold not fulfille; To Cristen Ã¾at repentaunt wer his croys he ?af with gode entent, thus at his deth diuiset her Ihesu Crist his testament. But to expoun apertly qvy he his croys assignet so, hit was forto gete mon mercy, And for trespas to suffre wo. For as Bede beres wittenesse, a cr[os]ce ys penaunce, leue ?e me, Crux apte a cruciatu dicitur. for what thing that may synne restresse, a verray crosce may callet be. Secundo in eo, quod passio eius fuit iniusta. The secunde cause, I may wel say, qwhi that hys payne more noyuse was, for of thre poyntes false in faye thay accuseden hym in that case. One was thay sayden that he forbede ?elde tribute to the emperour, to the secunde thay token hede that he vsurpet kenges honour, The thridde for thay herden hym say that he was God sone almight, thus in thre poynntes that ilke day thay accuset hym whit vnright. Therfore agayn Ã¾es poyntes thre that thai accuset hym to be shent, opon Gode Friday syngen we thre excusaciouns hym present. Popule meus quid feci tibi aut quis. In quich excusaciouns thre Crist vmbraides hom openly of thre gode dedis Ã¾at don hade he byfore to hom in gret any. The first upbraideng he hom mas, was how Ã¾at he of Egypt londe deliueret hom from al manas, ther-as bifore Ã¾ai wer in bonde. Vt patet in versibus: Quia eduxi te de terra Egipti, parasti crucem saluatori tuo. The secunde repref hit was hou Ã¾at he fed hom fourti ?er In desert &amp; vncouth plas with manna in meruelouse maner, And also did hom sich gras to lede hom out of alle daunger to hor cuntre, for any cas, As men that wer to hym ful der. Quia eduxi vos per desertum quadragynta Annis &amp;c. The thrid upbraide is hou Ã¾at he plauntide hom for his viner, âhou mi?t thai then so bitter be to ordeyn croice so for me her?â Quid vltra &amp;c. Ego plantaui te &amp;c. Therfore first, Ã¾er-as thai sayn that pay tribut wold he no?t, he vpbraides hom agayn of tribute ?ift hou he hom bro?t. Ther-as thay sayn he cald hym kyng, thai shuld haue thonkid hym his gode dede, that as kyng in myslikyng In desert fed hom in gret nede. Als thai repreuet hym that he saide that verray Goddis son was he, mich he mi?t better hom vpbraide that he ?af hom londe in gret lee, And his vine?erd made hom i-wys, quich vine?erd I may vnderstonde is Ierusalem, that flour is, I-myddes Ã¾e worlde most esy londe. Tercio quia ab amicis dampnatus est. The thrid cause is, sithen he was dampnet of hom Ã¾at shuld haue bene his frendes kyndlie in that cas And not sich sorowe on hym sene; For las wonder had ben i-wys ?if he of enmys suffride hade to quych he done hade er amys, sich manas tha?e he hade made, Or of aliens &amp; straungers that had not knowen hym bifore, but of his frendes &amp; verray feres he tholet that greuet mich Ã¾e more, And of his frende als suffride he that of on rote comen wer, therfore Ã¾e Sauter ?e shyn se to hor dede wel acordes her. Amici mei &amp; proximi mei, aduersum me appropinquauerunt &amp; steterunt. Item Iob xxx? capitulo: Noti mei quasi Alieni recesserunt A me. âFrendes &amp; neghburs in gret nede A?ayn me stoden ful stifly,â And frendis flowen, as Iob con rede, As vncouth men in most any. Of sich men also suffrid he that he had don ful mich fore, As sayn Ion writes, ?e moun se, the verray gospel ow bifore. Iohannes viij?: Multa bona opera operatus sum vobis, propter quod opus vultis me occidere. And Bede in is meditacioun spekes to Crist in this maner with ful gret deuocioun, As in Latyn is writen her,â ffor write Latyn may I not spar to sich as han vnderstondyng, but after Ã¾e Latyn I wil declar In Englisch, lewide to haue likyng. Beda: O bone Ihesu, quam dulciter cum hominibus conuersatus es, quam magna &amp; abundantissima largitus es eis, quam dura &amp; Aspera pro eis passus es, dura verba, duriora verbera, durissima crucis tormenta. âSwete Ihesu,â sais sayn Bede, âhow swetely to monnus likyng with mon to help hym in gret nede thi-self mon was with hom wonyng! âHou mich gode &amp; quat plente ?yuen hom graciously Ã¾ou has, hard &amp; sharp with hert fre suffret forto gete hom gras, âHarde wordes, harder betyng, And, that hardest of alle was, gret tourment on croice hongyng after al this gret manas!â Quarto ratione teneritudinis corporis. The furth cause is, in gode fay, qvy that his passioun greuet more then any oÃ¾er monnus may,â And I shal say ?ou skil qverfore. ffor, as we reden in holi writte, Boke of Kynges Ã¾at calde is, In liknes as to monnus witt bi Crist to Dauid was saide Ã¾is: Regum penultimo: Ipse est quasi tenerimus ligni vermiculus. âMost tender worm,â he sais, âis heâ; for more tendre thing ther nys thenne worme that bredes in a tre, therfore he likenet hym so i-wys. And Crist most nedely tendre be that was not geten by monnes seed, but of a wommon flesche toke he, therfor tendre he most be nede. The[r]-fore to Iewes whit hert fre spekes the gode clerk sayn Bede these Latyn wordes, that ?e schun se, good ys to hom ?e take hede. Beda: O Iudei, lapides estis, set lapidem percutitis molliorem, de quo resonat tynnitus pietatis &amp; ebullit oleum caritatis. â?e Iewes,â says sayn Bede the clerke, âstones ?e ben, I may wel say, as wel is sene by our werke, for harde hertes ?e han to-day, âffor a softer stone thenne ?e ?e beten opon ful bytterly, of whiche sounes soune of pite and oyle of charite largely.â [Quint]o ex eo, quod fuit eius penav niuersalis, quia per omnes partes &amp; per omnes sensus, primo per visum. The fift maner hit greuet sore, for his pyne was in vche place from hede to hele, bihinde, bifore, and alle his wittes he pynet was. ffurst sorow he had as in his sight, Thurgh teres that of hys eghen went, and Poule epistel speke oright to the Ebrues that he sent. Ther-to acordes Bede i-wys, that teres opon the croice sched he, for mon, that muche hade done amys, might haue compassion hym to se. Beda: Ascendit in altum, vt longius audiretur, fortiter clamauit, vt nullus excuseretur, clamor lacrimas addidit, vt homo compateretur. Bede says that he went on hegh opon the harde rode tre, forto be herd bothe fer and neght wordes that ther-on speke he. Stifly he cryet that no mon tho schuld fynde an excusacion, wihit crye sched teres bothe two of hym to haue compassioun. Other teres I fynde also he sched twye, as men rede moun, to Ierusalem pronouncyng wo, an La?eres resureccioun. So that I may wel say that [Ã¾]rye God sched teres her lyuyng; the furst for loue sched tendre-ly to se La?ere ther deed lyyng; The secunde teres, leue ?e me, wheren sched for grete compasion that he had for that fayre cite that he wyste schulde be dr[i]uen don; The thriddes teres as this day for sorow weren sched, men may wel se, when tha[t] he opon Good Friday sched teres opon the rode tre. That the furst teres of loue wer, I may preue by autorite, by mennes wordes that wer ner, and sayden, âhe louet hym, ?e moun se.â Ecce qualiter amabat eum. The secunde teres, as sayde I, wheren for grete compasioun that he had for the muche any that was comyng toward that toun; ffor he told ther in prophecy that hyt schuld be driuen doun, for thay kenewe not God al-mighty and tyme of hor saluacioun. Cum apropinquasset Ihesus Ierusalem, fleuit super illam &amp;c. Et infra in eodem capitulo: Non relinquetur lapis super lapidem, eo quod non cognoueris tempus visitacionis tue. But teres that he sched thys day weren for sorowe that had he and penaunce, no tung telle may, so henging opon rode tre. ij? in auditu, cum ei obprobria &amp; blasfemie irrogate sunt. The secunde maner, by hering Obprobria Christi &amp; blasfemie. pynet he was ful pitousely, when he herd Iewes fast crying that he wolde Moyses lawe destruye. And als in mony an-other thing thay fondet to do hym any, but four prerogatiues had that keng to maister hom whit, as tel wol I. Habuit primo excellentissimam nobilitatem. ffirst he hade excellent nobelte, forto godhede ?if we shyn go, verray Goddes sone was he, And he?est heuen he com fro. As to Ã¾e monhede, I may say that he was comen of kynges blode, therfore both God &amp; kyng verray I may preue hym, that was so gode, And in-as-mich as he was mon And comen of kynges kyndly, kyng in erth I calle hym con, And keng of heuen als verrayly. Thus preue his noblete, kyng of kenges men may hym calle, And lord of lordes, non sich as he, ffor of al wele he is Ã¾e walle. Prope est rex regum &amp; dominus dominancium. Agayn quich noblay speken Ã¾ai repreuyng vnresonably hym, that was Goddes son verray, smyth sone calde hym hokerly. Matheus xiij?: Nonne iste est filius fabri? Nonne mater eius dicitur Maria? Secundo habuit ineffabilem veritatem. Sothnes he hade in hym also, As hym-self saide in erth her that he was way to wayue our wo, sothnes, and lif all thre in fer. Ego sum, via veritas &amp; vita. A?ayn Ã¾at sothnes speken thay, As writes Ã¾e gode sayn Ion i-wys, repreuyng hym that he shuld say thing that wer fals &amp; al amys. Iohannes viij?: Tu de te ipso testimonium perhibes, testimonium tuum non est verum. âLo her,â Ã¾ai saiden, âhe was fals,â that was walle of al sothnes, way &amp; lif in hym was als, As I saide bifore expres. But sich sothnes had not Pilate, quen Ihesu Crist bifore hym come, that of sothnes laft Ã¾e ri?t gate And for hym falsly ordeynt dome. for he bigan his iugement with sothnes, as I shal ?ou say, but from Ã¾at way ful sone he went for wordly dede that ilk day. ffor quen he hade first tenderly examinet hou Ã¾e cause stode, he fonde gret malys &amp; enuy In hom, &amp; in Ihesu but gode, And saide, âin hym cause fynde I none.â then wer Ã¾ai ferd lest he shuld wende, And saiden, â?if Ã¾ou let Ã¾is mon gone, thou nart not Ã¾e emperoures frende.â Si hunc dimittis, non es amicus Cesaris. Then dred he indignacioun of Ã¾e emperour time comyng, And delyueret a?ayn resoun Ihesu to deth bout tarying. Tercio habuit insuperabilem potestatem. Also Crist hade, leuen we, So fulle mi?t &amp; eke power that mi?t no way ouer-comen be, As Ion Ã¾e euangelist witnes her: Omnia per ipsum facta sunt &amp; sine ipso factum est nihil. âAlle thing,â he saide, âby hym ben made, And bout hym is made no thing,â ?et a?ayn Ã¾is Ã¾e Iewes hade Agayn resoun a?ayn-pittyng. Mattheus xii?: Hic non eicit demonia nisi in Belzebub principe demoniorum. Thai saide quen he hade helide one that with an eul gost nyet was, that he by oÃ¾er power none then deulis power wro?t so has. Item Mattheus xxvii?: Alios saluos fecit, seipsum non potest &amp;c. Also Ã¾ai saide that holpen hade he mony bifore out of hor tene, but saue hym-self from rode tre my?t he not then, as wel was sene. âlo her,â Ã¾ai saide, âhe hade no my?t,â of quych Ã¾e contrary preue I may, As schowide was ry?t in hor si?t quen he was taken Ã¾e selue day; For alle that wer at his takyng with his voice he drof hom doun, ffor as thai to hym wer comyng And forto sese hym redy boun, he asket hom qvo Ã¾ai so?t so. âIhesu of Na?areth,â saide Ã¾ay, And fellen doun onon ri?t tho the first worde that he con say. Quem queritis? Ihesum Nazarenum, &amp; continuo ceciderunt in terram. opon this spekes saynt Austyn, And sais ful wel &amp; witterly that I shal first say in Latyn And in Englisch openly: Augustinus: Vna vox turbam odiis ferocem, armis terribilem sine vllo telo percussit, reppulit, strauit virtute latentis diuinitatis. Quid iudicaturus faciet, qui iudicandus hoc fecit? Quid regnaturus poterit, qui moriturus hoc fecit? âOne voice,â sais Austyn, âdrof al doun long-stra?t laide &amp; put a?ayn wode peple &amp; to bataile boun wel armet &amp; of mich mayn; âWith-out weppen, saue voys i-wys And hudde godhede hym with-in, so maistride he that diden omys, on his my?t that Ã¾ai shuld myn. âHow hope ?e sich a kyng con do, qven he shal sitt on iugement, That so his iugement goyng to with voice his enmys shamely shent? âQuat hope ?e that he be of my?t to do in his revme quen he is, that to Ã¾e deth goyng that ny?t so foule feride hom as in this?â Quarto habuit singularem bonitatem, quia nemo bonus nisi solus Deus. the furth vertu Ã¾at hade he, to quich Ã¾ai putten obiectioun, that was excellent bounte, As I may preue ?ow by resoun. ffor, as is writen in holy writt, nomon is gode with-outen vice, saue only God, leues wel hit, to wayue al syn may be so wys; ffor seuen sith in one day, I fynde, a ri?twis mon shal falle, but Cristis godnes in gode fay Appair my?t not Ã¾e Iewes alle. Sepcies in die cadit iustus. ?et a?aynus his gret godnes putten Ã¾e Iewes apertly, And saiden a synful mon he wes, As sayn Ion mas mynde witerly. Iohannes vi?: Nos scimus, quia hic homo peccator est, quia seductor est in sermone. âWe knowen,â saide Ã¾e Iewes tho, âthat this mon ful synful is, And fondes by worde to do vs wo, And bigile vs alle omys.â Lucas: Commouit populum docens per vniuersam Iudeam incipiens a Galilea vsque huc. Also Ã¾ai saiden Ã¾er Ã¾at he meuet Ã¾e peple wonderly thur?e-out Iude &amp; Galile And taght hom so apertely. Also thai saide with al his my?t Moyses la?e he wold destrye, As ?e moun se her in ore si?t, Ion witnes hit apertly. Iohannes ix?: Non est hic homo a Deo, qui Sabbatum non custodit. âthis monâ, Ã¾ai saide, âÃ¾at is her nys not on Goddis bihalue i-wys, that kepis not in gode maner his hali-day, as Ã¾e la?e is.â Tercio fuit eius dolor [in] odoratu. the third sorow Ã¾at he hade was of sauour al vnswete, And gret stynk Ã¾er was made with mennus carayns forto mete. for on that mount of Caluarie wer men punyscht for hor syn, And stynkyng bodies mony by And wiccut air that plas with-in. ffor Caluarie is as mich to say As balletship of hedes bar of men quen flesch is al away, And sich wer mony lying thar Of men gyrd of Ã¾e hede bifore, And lying Ã¾er al opunly; And therfore Ã¾at mount thur?e clercus lore was callide mount of Caluary, so that in smellyng Crist had gret tene quen he was comen to Ã¾at plas, thus in thre wittes, with-out wene, wonderly he pynet was. Quarto in gustu. The furth penauns was in tastyng, for quen he criet, âI am thirsty,â Aisel &amp; myrre thai con hym bryng with atter medelide hastily, That he thur?e aisel drynkyng to Ã¾e deth my?t soner hy, And thay that wer to hym kepyng Soner shutt of hor baly. ffor hit was Iewes opinioun Aisel shuld bryng hym sone to deth, And mirre shuld sone dryue doun forto suffre of hit Ã¾e breth, And of atter Ã¾e bitternes In tastyng hit shuld do hym tene, And poysoun hym sone in that destres, this was hor tho?t, as wel was sene. Quinto in tactu. The fift sorow was in touchyng, for al Ã¾e places of his body ffrom hede to hele, bout lesyng, al was to-torne dispitusly. And that alle wittes nyet wer, Bernarde preues apertly, As I shal rehers ?ou her, leret &amp; lewide to lerne Ã¾er-by. Bernardus: Caput angelicis tremebundum spiritibus densitate spinarum pungitur, facies pulcra pre filiis hominum sputis Iudeorum deturpatur, oculi lucidiores sole caligantur in morte, aures, que audiunt angelicos cantus, audiunt peccatorum insultus, os, quod docet angelos, felle &amp; aceto potatur, pedes, quorum scabellum adoratur, quoniam sanctum est, cruci clauo affiguntur, manus, que formauerunt celos, cruce, sunt extense &amp; clauis affixe, corpus verberatur, latus lancea perforatur, et quid plura? Non remansit in eo nisi lingua, vt pro peccatoribus exoraret &amp; matrem discipulo commendaret. Sayn Bernard first at Cristes hede bygynnes forto speke expres, And al Ã¾e body nothing is lede that he ne tellis ich distres That he tholet, as was sene, In body &amp; wittes two. for first hys hede with thornus kene ful bitterly was stongen tho. The fairest face Ã¾at euer had mon that time for vs was shamly shent with sputyng hokerly Ã¾er-on, for monnus hele sich harm he hent. His e?en Ã¾at wer more cler then Ã¾e sone is in his kynde, wiht delful dethe made thester wer, that dele hit ys to haue in mynde. His eres, that heren angel song, herden the sinful men gladyng; that mouthe, that tagh aungeles ymong, atter and aysel had to drynke. The fete that so worthy wer mon cusse the stole thay stonden on for holines, as he says her, wiht nayle wer fechet the rode opon. The hondes, that mad heuen blisse, on croice wer sprad dyspitouesly and wihit nayles ficchit amys, to bryng mon-kynd out of anye. His body was beten her and ther, no place laft on hit vntorne, hys syde was perset wiht a sper, to releue that wer forlorne. So nothing laft saue tong onely, thas he for synful men might pray, and to bytake hys moder Mary to hys disciple to kepe that day. Secundo fuit eius passio illusione despecta, vt patet infra. The secunde principal poynt is thys of Ihesu Cristes passioun, that of scornes hit was iwys despitouse and a?ayn resoun. Prima illusio in domo Anne. ffor four sithe foule he scornet was, As I sale tel apertely, the furst in byschopes hous Annas when he was taken anone in hy, Ther tholet he buffetes and spyttyng and despites mony moo, and ouer hys eghen also hulyng, he suld not se thay diden so. Ther-fore withe grete deuocioun Bernarde spekes to Crist expresse, hauyng of hym compassioun Bernardus. and thinking how he pynet was: Wltum tuum, domine bone Ihesu, desiderabilem, in quem desiderant angeli prosp[i]cere, sputys inquinauerunt, manibus percusserunt, velo pro derisione operuerunt, nec amaris uulneribus pepercerunt. âThi semblaunt,â he says, âlord Ihesu, that aungeles wilnen forto se, harmet was bothe huyde and hew whit sputtyng that was cast on the, âWiht hor hondes smytten thi face and hilden it wit a vaile a-boue, and bitter woundis Ã¾e ?iuen was, al Ã¾is Ã¾ou tholid lord for me loue.â Secundo fuit illusus in domo Herodis. The secunde hokur Ã¾at Ihesu hade was in Herodes house Ã¾o kyng, Ã¾at as a fole &amp; madde hym made to clethe hym so in quite clethyng; ffor, as Ã¾o gospel makus mynde, quen Pilate send oure lord Ihesu to Heroude forto bete &amp; bynde and deme after Ã¾at he knewe, Heroude sende hym sone a?ayn scornefully in quite clethyng, ffor to hym wold he nothyng sayn ne onsware after his wilnyng. Therfore touchyng Ã¾is mater spekus Bernard opunly, in Cristis nome ri?t as it wer, To Iheues Ã¾at diden Ã¾is any: Bernardus: Tu homo es &amp; habes sertum de floribus &amp; ego Deus habeo coronam spineam. âThow mon,â sais he, âgarlond Ã¾ou has of flouris faire &amp; bry?t schynyng, and for me, God, a crowne Ã¾ou mas of thornes strong &amp; scharp stingyng. Item Bernardus in persona Christi: Tu habes cyrotecas in manibus &amp; ego clauos ferreos. Also Bernard in Cristis nome sais, âgloues Ã¾ou hast, mon, on Ã¾i honde, &amp; I Ã¾urgh myne with mikul schome haue nailis driuen wit bittir bonde. Item Bernardus: Tu in albis vestibus tripudias &amp; ego pro te derisus ab Herode fui in veste alba, tu tripudias cum pedibus &amp; ego &amp; cum pedibus laboraui pro te. âThow daunces aboute in quite clethyng, and I in quite a?ayn was sent ffrom Heroude to Pilate in hethyng, siche harmes for Ã¾i hele I hent. âÃou daunces wit fete in gret likyng, And my feete arm schomely schent for tene on rode tre trauelyng, to vntegh Ã¾e is myn entent. Item Bernardus: Tu in choreis brachia extendis in modum crucis in gaudium &amp; ego ea in cruceex tensa habui in obprobrium, ego in cruce dolui &amp; tu in cruce exultas. âThow in Ã¾o ryng of carolyng spredis Ã¾in armes furth from the, And I on croice have hom spredyng schamely, as men movn see. âÃus on croice I was sorowyng of thraldam, mon, to make Ã¾e fre, And Ã¾ou in croice gret mirth makyng, I mynde on Ã¾e, Ã¾ou noon on me. Item Bernardus: Tu habes latus apertum signum vane glorie &amp; ego latus fossum habui pro te. Tamen reuertere ad me &amp; ego suscipiam te. âThow has side opon for vayn-glorie, And I side stongen, sene it is, neuer-Ã¾e-latter to me Ã¾ou hie and I wil take Ã¾e to my blis.â Tres cause notantur quare Christus tacuit coram Herode, Pilato &amp; Iudeis. Thre causis Ã¾er ben quy Ã¾at Ihesu was stille so in examinyng of Pilate, Heroude, &amp; Iewes vntrewe, Ã¾at fondede[n] hym in mony a thyng. The first cause was witturly for Cristis onsware forto here alle Ã¾o men were vnworthy Ã¾at te[m]pt hym in Ã¾at manere. The secunde cause was Eues offense, for ho in speche synnet sore, Ã¾erfore Ihesu by silence most mende Ã¾at ho so did before. Tho thrid cause was witterly, for alle Ã¾yng Ã¾at vnswaret he, Ã¾ai dispisiden hokurly And fonden chalange, leue ?e me. Tercio fuit illusus in domo Pilati. The thrid dispite Ã¾at had Ihesu was in Pilate house i-wis, Ã¾er in a mantil of purpur hew Ã¾o kny?tis cladden hym al a-mys, And a rede putten in his honde And thornen crowne opon his hede, ffor, as thay sayden, keng of that londe he claymet al a?ayne hor rede; and thenne thay gretten hym kneling, as he sat in that aray, al in hoker and hething, âhayl keyng of Iewes,â sayden thay. Aue rex Iudiorum. Nota de corona. That coroun of thornes, as leuet is, of se-rusches maad hit was, that as scharpe ben, leue wel this, as thornes and as muche scharp has; So scharp thai wirne and so biting that to the brayne thay ficchit we[r], as Bernard telles in his teching, and as in Latyn is writen her: Bernardus: Capud illud divinum multiplici spinarum densitate vsque ad cerebrum confixum est. sayn Bernard sais Ã¾at Cristes hede with thik thornus sharp &amp; kene ri?t to Ã¾e brayn til he was dede was thrast thur?e-out, as wel was sene. De anima tres sunt opiniones, vt infra. now is to wit in qvat plas his saule hade principal wonyng, ffor in thre stides so?t hit was In hert &amp; hede &amp; blode rennyng. first Ã¾at Ã¾e saule shuld haue his se in monnus hert principaly, that preues this autorite, Goddes word of Ã¾e euangely:â De corde exeunt cogitaciones. God sais Ã¾at tho?tes ay ben boun out of Ã¾e hert to be comyng, Ã¾erfore bi sum opinioun ther shuld Ã¾e saule haue his wonyng. or in Ã¾e blode hit may wel be, As wel witnes holi writ that monnus &amp; bestes soule has se In Ã¾e blode &amp; Ã¾er is hitt. Vnde habetur in Leuitico: Anima omnis carnis in sanguine est. or ellis in the hede it is bi force of this autorite, for quen Crist de?et, ?e knowen Ã¾is, bo?yng his hede Ã¾e gost ?eld he. Et inclinato capite emisit spiritum. but forto preue bi gode assay And dede qver Ã¾at his soule mi?t be. the Iewes so?ten as this day his saule in alle Ã¾es places thre, ffor in Ã¾e hede with al hor mayn thai so?t his saule, as was wel sene, with croun of thornus to Ã¾e brayn, to loke Ã¾er-in ?if hit had bene. In blode Ã¾ai so?ten hit also quen thai openet his vaynus wide, In fete &amp; honde both two with nailes sharp on ich side. In hert Ã¾ai so?ten with gret wo when Ã¾ai percet hit with a sper so that out nedelyngis hit most go, thay so?ten hit so wide qver. And for thes ilk despites thre that Crist hade imong oÃ¾er wo, on Gode Friday syngen we thre honourynges a?aynes tho; Agyos with deuocioun thrye knelyng deuoutly, for thrie for our saluacioun scornet he was dispitously. Tercio fuit eius passio multiplici vtilitate fructuosa. The thrid principal poynt of alle, As I saide at bigynnyng, was that his passioun wold wel falle to be nedful in mony a thing, And frutful also in gode fay In thre maners ?e shyn se, tha?e hit [f]ul delful wer Ã¾at day, nedful hit was as in thes thre. Triplex vtilitas, id est peccatorum remissio, gracie collacio &amp; glorie exhibicio. ffor mon-kynde bi his passioun of Adam syn vnbounden was, that calle I of syn remissioun, the secunde poynt was gift of gras, The thrid is ioy with-out endyng that by his deth [h]e wonen has, qven that we of this world shul wende And mendet be of our trespas. Therfore saynt Austyn wel con say that Ihesu Crist our saueour with his deth wesch syn away that was &amp; is &amp; als comyng. Augustinus: Culpam deleuit Christus presentem, preteritam &amp; futuram. ffor syn that was don bifore he forgaf at his de?yng, And syn Ã¾at then was greuyng sore he dro?e men fro with his prechyng, And grace he grantide to las &amp; more forto wayue syn comyng, to alle men that in wille wore to seche Ã¾at gras &amp; hyt suyng. ffour skilles I fynde, in gode fay, that his passioun nedful was, As I shal expresly say, And as saynt Austyn mynde mas. Augustinus: Modus nostre redempcionis fuit acceptissimus ad placandum Deum, congruentissimus ad curandum morbum, efficacissimus ad extrahendum genus humanum &amp; prudentissimus ad expugnandum generis humani inimicum. ffor to grete God it was i-wys most acceptable &amp; likyng, And forto hele Ã¾at ferd amys most couenable of any thyng, And forto bryng into blis hit was most of power tho, And most sle?e way, leue wel this, to ouer-come the deul our fo. ffirst to preue his passioun to God most acceptable was, ?e shyn se bi gode resoun As saynt Ancelme mynde mas. Anselmus: Nichil asperius &amp; difficilius potest homo pati ad honorem Dei sponte &amp; non ex debito quam mortem. âNo thingâ, he sais, âso bitter is ne non so heuy to go tille, As mon for God &amp; heuen blis to suffre deth with gode wille. âNe more may nomon to God do to plese hym with deuoutly, then forto offir his lif hym to And deth to suffir bodily.â Therfore Paule sais bi Ihesu, hym-self to God then offrid he In sacrifyce his wille to sewe, that swetly sauouret, leue ?e me. Ad. Ephesios iiij?: Tradidit semet ipsum oblacionem &amp; hostiam Deo in odorem suauitatis. But how Ã¾at Crist was sacrifise to make his fader monnus frende, &amp; restoret vs to be hys, I schal declare ow er I wende. Augustinus de Trinitate: Quid tam grate suscipi posset, quam caro sacrificii nostri corpus effectum sacerdotis nostri Christi? Vt qu[oniam] quatuor considerantur in omni sacrificio: videlicet cui offoratur &amp; quid offeratur, pro quibus offeratur &amp; quis offerat, exponitur in lingua materna. âwhat maner thingâ, sais saynt Austyne, âmore derworth may taken be then Cristis body to suffre pyne, that verray preste is, leue ?e me? âAnd hauyng consideracioun to four poyntes Ã¾at he con say, I may preue Ã¾at his passioun vnkyntt Ã¾e deulis bonde to-day. âffor mon Ã¾at offres he mot se to qvom he offres, &amp; quat thing, for qvom that offrande eke shal be, And qvo als makes that offryng. âAs towchinge offring maad this day, Ihesu Crist that offring was, offrer al-so in good faye, for offering of hym-self he maas. âTo restore vs as he may to his fader, that offering taas; thus offring, offrer, sothe to say, and offring-taker eke towe has. âthe furthe was mon he offret fore to make in hym as one to be, to wone wihit hym for euermore in heuen blisse, right as dose he.â Also how and in quat maner by Crist reconcilet so ben we, saynt Austyn says, as ?e schun here, that Crist these four most nedely be. Augustinus: Christus est sacerdos, sacrificium, Deus &amp; templum. Sacerdos, per quem sumus reconciliati, sacrificium quo sumus reconciliati, templum, quo sumus reconciliati. ffor prest he was, I may wel say, thurgh whom reconcilet we wer tho, and sacrafice calle hym I may that for vs suffert suche wo, God also, that nys no nay, to whom reconselet so wer we, and temple hit was done in that day withouten drede also was he. For a gode mon of lyuyng Goddes temple callet is, therfore to calle hym so, methynke I may say wel and not amys. Secundo passio Christi fuit congruentissima ad curandum morbum. As to the secund nedeful thing that come of Cristesse passion, medicyn moost acordyng hit was to bring vs of baundoun. The wichche acording medicyn had thre poyntes, ?e schun se, tyme and place to do hit inne, and maner of doyng, ther ben thre. Primo ex parte temporis. As to the tyme, I may wel say hyt was done resonably, for Adam made was that ilke day that Crist deghet vs to for-by, On a Fryday, in gode fay, and Marche mone als, as rede I, ther-fore our synne to put away thay wel semet witerly. And that selue day iwys conceyuet was he of may Mary, and that day wanne a?ayne that blisse that Adam lost vnhappily. so that tyme of hys passioun for these causes rekenet her, I may preue by gode reson, was ordenyt in ful gode maner. Tercio ex parte loci. as to the place hyt was done inne, skylful hit was fo[r] causes thre a?ayne our wele so forto wynne inmyddes the world, as reden we. ffor Ierusalem, clerke[s] sayn, in-myddes the worlde ys set iwys, therfore to wynne ther-a?ayne skilful hit was and not amys That vertu of hys passion on vche syde might bote be, ffor by Sathanas treson schent was vche side, leue ?e me. and Ã¾at londe commune I may calle, Ierusalem, Ã¾er-as suffurt he. Bot Ã¾o place was specialle of Caluary, as ?e schun se. The croice he deghet on that day for hym was ordenyt and no moo, therfore the croice wel calle I may Hys one place s[peci]al to hym tho. But to de-clare wel to our wit these thre places apertely, I pray ow takes hede to hit and I wol telle ow sone in hye. Thre places I haue nomet her, commune, special, and onely, and what in hom bifore done wer to ow declare now wol I. In commune place, lond of Iude, our forme fader formet was, in a felde, as reden we, that felde is calle[t] of Damas. also buriet was he in a ful special place ther-as Crist deghet opon rode tre, As Grekes story mynde mas, Auttentike thagh hit ne be, suche opinion that folke has; but after the boke of Iosue in Ebron Adam buriet was. Also by place that was onely Adam bygylet was i-wys, in loco singulari by a tre that did hym ny to ete of hit when he did mys; And right as he willesfully by a tre lost suche a blisse, Crist on a tre thoght skylfully to forby that er was his. Tercio ex parte modo [cu]randi. the thrid was maner of hys doyng that nedet greetly good to be, forto hele whit suche a thing, now ?e moun here that wel did he. ffor that harme so forto hele per contraria &amp; similia. in tow maner bote he soght, by lykly thing withe forto dele, And eke contrarius was his thoght. That he helet by lykly way wytnesses Austyn witerly, as her in Latyn ys verray, And Englische als, as schowe wol I. Augustinus: Homo homines, mortalis mortales, morte mo[r]tuos liberauit. Saynt Austyn says, as ?e schun her, that mon forboght men that wer lorn, that dedely was maad dedely der, and wiht deth maad fre thral biforn. Ambrosius: Ex terra virgine Adam, Christus ex virgine Per mulierem stulticia, per mulierem sapiencia, nudus Adam, nudus Christus, mors per lingnum, uita per lingnum, in deserto Adam, in deserto Christus. Also saynt Ambrose, âmon was made of clene erthe bout corupcioun, Criste of a virgine his flesche hade to make acorde by gode reson. âBy wommon foly furst bigan When al mon-kynde thurgh hyr was lorne, wommon a?ayn that wele wel wanne thurgh Crist al of hir body born. âAdam was naket after his synne and Crist naket on rode tre, thus worthily our wele to wynne thing wel acording vset he. âBy a tre deth was in broght and by a tre coom lif a?ayne, in desert was Adam wroght and in deserte Criste fast ful fayn.â Thus by way wel a-cording for-boght worthily we wer, and als by medicyn discordyng helet we wer, as ?e schun her. Per contraria. Gregorius. ffor, as sayn Gregory beres witnesse, Adam synnet in synnes thre, pruyde, glotery, vnbuxumnesse, thurght whiche harmet so was he. ffor to Goddes worthynesse he coueytet likly forto be when he willenet that cunnyngnesse that goddes haden in hor degre; for when the deuel hym so bihight that thay as goddes sulden be slegh, pruyde was in his hert pight in hope to be heuen on hegh; And in vnbuxumnesse also He synnet, as ?e schun wel se, when God bad hym bifore tho to ete none appul of that tre, A?aynes his biddyng willesfully he fraistet of hyt and did offense, and so synnet horribly in this synne in-obedience. Also he synnet in gloteri to tast that fruyt so fayr in sight, whiche th[re] synnes sotily helet Ihesu ful of might. And vset ys most communely contrarius medicyn forto dight in fi[s]ik and in surgery, who-ser wol hele a sore oright. Contraria contrariis curantur. And to hele prouyde he toke mekenesse and schewet hit, as I preue may, and forto hele vnbuxumnesse hys fader wille fulfullet ay, and forto hele glotery fourty days he fast in fere, thus by contrarius surgery he helet these thre synnes her. Therto acordes Paule oright by thys worde that I sal say, he meket hymself that lorde of might maad buxum to the deth that day. Ad Philippenses ij?: Humiliauit semet ipsum, factus obediens, vsque ad mortem. As to the forme worde of the clause, ther-as he sayes he meket hym so, the[r] helet he pruyde by skylful cause contrariouse medicyn taking tho. Humiliauit semet ipsum proprius. Ther-as he says that Crist was made obedient as his fader bidding, a?aynes unbuxumnesse he hade buxumnesse medicyn discordyng. Ther-as he says right to the deth he helet that tyme glotery, for when he put out dethes breth he says, âme thur[s]tes wonderly.â And als I fynde al his lif-day whil that he on erthe went, in abstinence he liuet ay of mete and drynke wher he wer lent. Thus by medicyn acording and discording bothe in fere helet vs thene our heuen keng Whil that he was erthe her. Tertius modus nostre redempcionis fuit efficacissimus ad attrahendum genus humanum. The thrid maner of his doyng, when that Crist vs so for-boght, was most might-ful in al thing to drawe mon to hym that he wroght. Better might he not witerly haue done thenne, as he did that day, to make mon loue hym tenderly and turst in hym with hert verray. how he drogh vs to hys loue Bernarde telles, as ?e schun se, speking to hym in heuen aboue, in grete deuocioun that hade he. Bernardus: Super omnia reddit te amabilem, bone Ihesu, calix, quem bibisti, opus nostre redempcionis. Hoc omnino amorem nostrum facile totum sibi vendicat, hoc est, quod nostram deuocionem et blandius allicit &amp; iustus exigit &amp; arcius stringit &amp; vehementius afficit. âOuer al thing, swete Ihesu, the penaunce that thow toke for me mas the louet in hert trewe, for with that wo for-boght wer we. âAnd that werke chalenget witerly vs to loue hym of dewete, and our deuocioun kyndly drawes in hert ay to-ward te. âalso hit chalanges skilfully and distreynes vs gode to be, wiht ful hert and feruently to loue the ay with hert fre.â And how he drogh vs with his dede in hym to hawe effectioun, the appostel, as I rede, preues hit by good resoun. Qui eciam proprio filio suo non Pepercit, set pro nobis omnibus tradidit illum. Paule says, âthe hegh keng of blisse his owen sone ne sparet noght, but for vs alle that deden amys send hym doun and vs forb[o]ght; âand when he send hym adoun so, With hym he ?af vs al thing;â therfore to truste hym and nomoo mater we han at our likyng. Quarto fuit prudentissimus ad expugnandum generis humani inimicum. The furthe mater, in gode fay, that he vs of bale broght, was bi good sleght he con assay our enemy forto bryng to noght. And to that sleght wel acordyng spekes Iob these wordes her, âhis wys sleghtâ, he says, âdoun con bring our foo to make vs to hym der.â Job xxvi?: Prudencia eius percussit superbum. Item capitulo vltimo: Numquid poterat cap[er]e Leuiathan hamo? Leuiathan est serpens &amp; assimilatur diabolo. Also Iob askes a questioun, whether the nedder Leuiathan, that to the deuel we liken moun, With a hook may not be tan. Thenne says the glose that Criste had sette a hud hook by his deite to cacche the deuel in mennes dette, as to mon bifore did he. And that mete that he with mette was Crist al in his humanite, but mon-hede was to goddehede sette to priue the deuel of his pouste. Thenne come the deul that mete to fette, whiche mete monnes flesche may be, And that was thenne, as God byhette, the deuel with hook that so sette he. Takyng mete that ther was lede of mon-kynde, that he made do mys, with the hook of hys godhede caght he was right wel iwys. Of whiche sleght and eke taking spekes Austyn, the grete doctour, and says at Cristes don-comyng ouer-comen was Sathan and our traytour. Augustinus: Venit redemptor &amp; victus est deceptor. Item Gregorius: Quid fecit redemptor captiuatori nostro? Tetendit muscipulam cru[c]em suam, posuit in ea escam sanguinem suum. âwhat did Godâ, says Gregory, âto hym that vs in bondage broght, but dight his engyne to destruy that a?ayn mon-kynde had wroght. âThe holy croice was his engyne, the mete his body opon hit pight to put our eneme into pyne and make monkyndes languour light.â Criste wold also his blode ther schede to breke the chartre that Eue made, as says Austyn, good ys to hede, wordes that I wol say ful rade. Cirographum Eue, Augustinus: Eva peccatum a diabolo mutuauit, cirographum scripsit, fideiussorem dedit &amp; vsura posteritati creuit. Eue borowet synne at Sathanas and wrote a chartre to hym of wo, founden hym a borogh also ho has, and to hir ospring after tho Al that meschef lafte ho has that alwa sprong to one and mo, As I schal, and I may haue grace, say more clerele er I go. ffurste I say ho borowet synne at the deul and schewet in dede, when that ho wold not hertly mynne on Goddes bidding that he bede. But to his foule suggestioun enclinet sone and was asent noght withstonding temptacion, but breke al hys commaundement. A chartre ho wrote als wyterly when ho putte hir hond to that tre to touche that appul willesfully that God forbede hir done schuld be. Borgh ho fonde, als sone in hy, making Adam to synne assent, so broght ho al hir progeny in seruage after and schamely schent, Thil Crist coome and with Mary mette And for synne that ho borowet hade, sched his blode and whit hir dette and suche a manumissioun made. Manumissio est litera acquietancie quando natiuus redimitur. That chartre he breke that ho wrote so when he to helle ?ates come, And took hom oute bothe one and mo after his dethe by rightwys dome. The borgh h[e] broght als of daunger, when that he rose the thridde day and to his brether con apper and made hom knowe hym God verray. And right as one made Adam to falle by hyr foule excitacioun, so Crist comfortes vs one and alle at his resurectioun, And made vs by that victori to vayue synne in our entent, and Eue of borghode to forbye at bigynnyng when h[o] was blent. Now for wengaunce of that dede that Iudas did for coueytise, Pilate also for grete drede, the Iewes for en[u]y alle vnwise, To alle these felle vengaunce i-wys, as I wol tel er I go away, but of Pilate that did mys furst sum-what I wol say. De natiuetate Pilati. Sum tyme I rede ther was a keng, Tirus was that kenges name, lay by a wenche was fayr and ?eng, Pila callet was that dame. A mulwardes doghter ho was, on whiche the keng so lyyng by a sone that tyme geten has in synne of auoutery. When hit was born this wommon thoght, for hit was geten of a keng, hir fader name vp schuld be broght and hir one to be lestyng; And of hir faderes name i-wis, that Atus heght, and hires also one name ho made, nothing amys, and Pilate callet that childe tho. when that child was thre ?er old, Pila sent hym to the keng, the keng was glad thenne, [be] ?e bolde, and receyuet hym at likyng. Thenne had the keng a sone ful der, and by hys wyf geten was he and born also the selue ?er that Pilate was, as rede we. These two wer norischet bothe in fere til thay wer in monnes degre, and as ?outhe askes kyndele here preuedyn of maistryes, leue ?e me. But ay the trewele geten chylde in iustyng and in tournament And other gamenes that wer wylde, alway he whit the worschip went. When that Pilate soght this thing to his brother he had enuye, and waytet hym tyme at hys liking forto sle hym priueli. When the keng herd of this caas, that one sone that other had slayne, of wo and sorowe ful he was, but when he segh hit wold not gayne, After his conseile sone he sent to witte what best wer forto do; alle thay demet by one assent that Pilate the deth schuld go to. But ?et the keng tho hym bithoght euel after euel ful hard hit wer, double his sorowe wold he noght to sle his sone in that maner, But forto put hym sone away hym thoght in that cas was the best, for when he mynnet of that a-fraye his hert was alway in unrest, And sent hym to Rome anone in ostage ther for to be, for he aght tribut ?ore agone for to ?iue to that cite. One cause was to be gultelesse of hys sones deth by dome, and to be schut his cause wes of tribut he schuld ?iue to Rome. Thenne [w]as that tyme in Rome also in ostage right as Pilate was the kenges sone of Fraunce tho, and thay wer putte in one place. but when that Pilate segh that he was reuerencet for his worthynesse and more then Pilate of degre of maneres and of dughtynesse, Pilate sles hym preueley, as he his brother did byfore. thenne wer the Romaynes in any and in hertes greuet sore, And conseileden what best wer to do with Pilate in that caas, And thoghten suche a mon was der to maister schrewes as hymself was. Thenne was ther an ile negh Rome myght not maister in no maner, And for Pilate was schrew and slegh hom thoght hit best that he ther wer, That auther by hys wikkettnesse he might maister hom vchone, or be slayne in that distresse, and thus theder thay let hym gone. But Pilate had a ful insight whi that he was so theder sent, and thoght to saue al that he might his lif of hom that he ner schent. And what whit prayer, ?iftes eke, And distresse ther he segh nede, this cruel folke he mad right meke And monly maistret, as I rede. ffor he so maistret wikket men And of hom gete the victori, to his nome wel he caght thenne Pilate of Pounce ful worthily. Thenne herd Heroud keng of Iude his stoutenesse and his sleght also, send after hym thenne thoght he to rule the lawe in his londe tho, And heght hym ?iftes largeli to be in Iudee hegh iustice; he segh auauntage ther wold ly, and theder come for couetise. When he had ben ther a gode while and gederet siluer grete plente, he thoght Heroud for to bigyle, And to Rome a-none gose he, And purchacet that ilk office to terme of liue wiht-out letting, and of Iude to be iustice a?aynes the wille of Heroud keng. And this was one cause witerly that Heroud was wrothe with Pilate, to purchace in his lond maistri a?aynes his wille to hawe astate. So tho two neuer saght wer til Ihesu Cristes passion, when that Pilate in meke maner sent Ihesu, as ?e rede moun, To Heroud in clethyng al white; thenne wex thay frendes for that dede, for Heroud had ful grete delite to se Ihesu Crist, as I rede. So Pilate, as ?e knowen alle, sat opon Crist in iuggement, and demet that lord of wele the walle to deth and eke to hard tourment. Thenne was hit tolde the emperour that he had demet gultlesly Ihesu Crist our saueour; thenne send Pilate anone in hy To excuse hym of that trespas that to the emperour was tolde, of Crist that thurgh hym dampnet was, for ful ferd he was, be ?e bolde. So in this tyme felle a sekenesse opon the emperour wonderly, that to bring hym of destresse halp no fi[s]ik ne surgery. Then was hit told hym of Ihesu that helet mesel, halt and blinde onely whit word, that men wel knewe, and in Iude mon schud hym fynde. But he that told had ne knowing that Ihesu so bifore was slayne, but hopet that he had ben liuing and to hawe helit hym in ful mayn. Thenne spake the emperour anone to Volusian, his priue, and bad hym forthe that he schud gone to seche that leche al in Iude, And that he schuld comounde Pilate to send that leche to hym in hie, for he wold haue hym algate to he[l]pe hym oute of hys any. When Volusian comen was to Pilate from the emperoure, his ernde he schewes with manace, thenne was Pilate in grete langour, And asket dayes ful fourtene to seche Ihesu wer that he wer, excuset if he might haue bene by any sleght that he might ler. So hit bifel in-wit this space of fourte[en]e dayes, as sayde I, Volusian a speche has with a gode vommen priualy,â Wiche wommon by-fore was louet with Ihesu derworthely, and in hym fonde godenesse and grace, Veronica heght ho weterly,â And asket hir of swete Ihesu. thenne criet ho, âalas! alas!â and sayd that lord ful wel ho kn[e]w that Pilate slogh witheouten trespas. Wen Volusian herd of this, that Crist was slayne that he so soht woo he was forsothe i-wis and thoght his gate ther seruet of no?ght. Thenne sayd Veronica to the knight and bad hym be of god comford, and sayde ho cowthe schew hym a sight that schuld fully hele his lorde. âffor when my lorde,â sayde this wommon, âswete Ihesu, was her preching, forto loke my lord opon I hade a wonder grete likyng, âThat what tyme so he wer away that I might haue of hym no sight, heuy I was that ilke day and my hert might no-way be light. âSo to a payntour forthe I went hys ymage to paynt apertely, that wat tyme Ihesu wer absent I might haue a comfort therbi. âAnd as I went so theder-ward to seche the payntour, sothe to say, my lorde Ihesu come me to-warde and asket whider I was in way. âWhen that I told hym myn entent that to the payntour I wolde goo, my keuerchaf of my hede he hent and layde hit on hys visage tho. âAnone his liknesse verrayli schowet hym on my waile oright, glad and ioyful thenne was I and thenket God with al my might. Ther-fore ?if that thi lord may se that ymage and that fayre lickenesse, trowely therto trust may he to be clene schwt of his sekenesse.â Thenne was Volusian swithe glad And asket whether hit might be boght for any gold the emperour had, and ho says, ânay, that might hit noght, âSaue onely with deuocion And gode beleue in God al-might, but to go with the I am boune that ymage forto schew in sight.â So Veronica forthe went to Rome with that worthi knight forto schewe with gode entent that ymage, as ho had bihight. When thay to Rome comen wer the knyght went to the emp[er]our and told his ernde fully enter, of Ihesu Crist our sauiour, How that Pilate hym had slayne and the Iewes vnright-wisly, but ?et one thyng to make hym fayne he sayd he had ther al-redy. âWith me is comen a matroun that his ymage withe hir has broght, thurgh seght of wicheche saluacioun wold falle, ?if ?e wer trw of thoght.â When the emperour herd of this, silken clothis he made to lay and with grete worschyp eke i-wys schowet that ymage ther verray. Anone as he had sight hole he was of hys sekenesse and thonket Ihesu ful of might that so had broght hym of distresse. And that ymage in-to thys day in Rome I rede men to se, and after that wommon, in gode fay, Veronica callet as rede we. Then send the emperour in hy after Pilate in to Iude, and swere he schuld haue no mercy but schomful dethe that men schud se. When he to Rome was broght i-wys the emperour with wonder tene sayde for that he had done mys wroken opon hym wold he bene, ffor he so foule Ihesu had slayne no deth to hym might ordenyt be so lodly, nys not forto layne, as deseruet thenne had he. But when Pilate forthe was broght in-to the emperoures sight, A sotil sleght he had soght As I to telle now haue i-tight. ffor opon hym that cote he hade that Ihesu bifore on hym were, the wiche Mary hys moder hym made, and seemles was al weuen entere. When the emperour had a sight on Pilate so in that aray, haue wille to harme hym he ne might, but al his angur went away, And in his egh had al grace; on this ther merueilet mony one but from hym when he passet was, wode wrothe withe hym he was anone, And swere his othe he schulde be dede, made eft to calle hym hym byforne, on liue schuld he not be lede his othe he has apertyly sworn. But wen he was comen a?ayn and the emperour seght hym, of hys come he was fayne And grawntet hym bothe lif and lym, And saluet hym al louelily, on whiche men merweilet mony one, so did tho emperour witerly how that his wrathe away was gone. When he thus was seruit thrye, come Veronica anone, that Pilates sleght con wel aspye on whiche ther was perceyuet none, And sayd, âsir keng, by hys coyntyse ?e bene bighilet sotyly, thys faste thefe that now her ys weres one clothe vn-worthily, âHe has that wede on hym i-wys that wroght our lady swete Mary to Ihesu my lord ful of blisse, hyr sone that he so con destrye. âAnd whil he hit opon hym has, this thef [Ã¾]of he vnworthi be, in our egh he has that grace that al thing likes ?ow that dos he. âBut wolde ?e spoile hym of that wede by wiche that grace ys geten amys, that grace schuld schamely from hym schede and he be knewn as he is.â When the emperour herd this thing, he maad to spoile hym hastily and after come by-fore the keng, thenne was he fully his enemy. Men tolden then the emperour that merwailet meche in hys maner, that Mary moder and frely flour had wroght that wede that he so wer. Thenne comondet he in hy to putte Pilate in presoun til he had ordenit wittily bi consel his damnacioun, ffor by doom to hym ?iuen was most horible dethe that might be, therfore the emperour toke hym space the worst to ordine, leue ?e me. When Pilate herd hit schuld be so that by no way ascape he might, with his knif in prison tho he slogh hym-selfe anone in hight. When the emperour hym by-thoght what dethe Pilate deghet on, he sayd, âfor-sothe his dethe was noght but clene a?ayne the kynde of mon. âffor that mon deghet wrecchedly that slogh hym-self in that maner, and sparet not hys one body that kindely schuld be more der.â Thenne teghet thay to hym a stone that weyet muche and wonderly, and kesten into Tiber anone, a reuer rennyng Rome by. Anone as he in Tibur was, deueles gedereden hym aboute and raysede tempest in that place that steret bothe stif and stoute, Now vp now doun the deueles hym bar, &amp; openly Ã¾at men might se day and night in foule maner, that nyet was al that cite. When men of Rome seghen this that thay for hym might hawe no rest, thay droghen hym anone i-wys, and in-to Rone thay hym kest, Bysyde Viegne that water ys, ther thay hopet he schuld be lest, and for thing he had done amys to kest hym ther thay thoght hit best; ffor tha haden this opinioun, that Viegne was the way to helle; and a place of malesoun acording for hym ther forto dwelle. Viegna, quasi via Iehenne, quia tunc erat locus maledictionis. But anoon as he was ther, deuelis diden as bifore, and al that cite conen fere as Rome with mescheues, and wel more. When that men of that cite seghen that vengaunce was for hym, thay beren hym thethen, leue ?e me, to cite of Losan vche lym, And ther thay buryet hy[s] body. then ferden deueles as by-fore, rayseden tempestes horibly, that greut al that cite sore, And beren hym thethen to a pitte, ther hulles wer on vche syde, of that scherwe so wer thay schutte for ther he might best a-byde. And that place was out of the way mony a myle from vche toun, And ?et arn deueles ther this day to trouble men al rede boun, That nomon dar come to that place for ferd of deueles fantasy, suche his lif and endyng was as I fynd in sum story. De origine Iude traditoris Dei. Nowe of bygynnyng of Iudas and endyng eke ?e schun her, how he born and geten was, as I haue red I sal ow ler. In Ierusalem was wonyng a mon heght Ruben, as rede I, had a wyfe to his likyng, Teborea callet was witterly. So hit bifel opon a night, as thay bothe in bed lay, thay dalten to-geder as was right and afte slepeden bothe thay. Thenne was the wommon sore affright for sweuenes that ho met er day, and to hir husbont sone in hight wat ho met ho con hym say. âMethoght,â ho sayd, âthat I had born a wikket child, for sothe i-wys, thurgh wiche our nacioun suld be lorne, for that chilt muche schal do amys.â When he herd his wyf so telle, he bad in hit haue no l[e]uyng, and sayd sum wykket gost of helle had temptet hir as in that thing. and ho sayde sekerly not so, but if that ho conseyuet hade, that child suld be grete cause of wo, and muche moon ther-fore ho mad. So afte a sone this womon bere that fered was fader and moder eke, and in grete langour als thay wer a gode conseile for to seke; ffor hor sone ther ?if thay had slayne, horible dede hit had ibene, and forto noriche wer thay not fayne a chylde to bryng hom alle in tene. But in a basket pryuely thay putten thys boy when he was borne, and on a warthe the water by thay layden hym ther to be forlorne. That ilke basket he was inne of rusches made hit was i-wys that no water might in wynne of one hole, as a tale ys. So with se-wawes broght was he to an ile that Scarioth hight, and after that ile, as rede we, nomet he was and by right. So causely to se the flode the whene come to the water-syde, and se waggyng ther ho stode that basket, as ho con a-byde, And made hir men goo after hit, a knawe schylde thai fond ther-inne thenne siket ho in hir wytte, wischet that ho might suchon wynne, ffor childe hir-selfe then had ho noon, wher-fore ho was ful miselyking, and hit was fayr of blode and bone that ho fond in that lepe lyyng. Thenne the whene hir vmbethoght by slegh way forto plese the keng, and that childe by-fore hym broght, sayd hyt was hires of hys getyng. The keng when he segh that sight, supposet sothe that the whene sayde, thenne was hys hert ful wonder light and al hys loue opon his lady. So [in] al the reume grete word was that the whene a sone had born, and vche mon grete lykyng has to se an ayre ther hom byforne. So fel after a li[t]til space the whene conceyuet of the keng and bare a sone, none fayrer of face ny of alle lymmes more likyng. When these childer waxen were that thay couthen speke and go, thay fughten ofte tyme in fere, And Iudas dyd hym muche wo, And hys brother ofte to reme; ther-of the wene was nothyng payde, for in hyr hert ho couthe wel deme hir sone was he not as men sayde. And ofte tyme ho bete Iudas and sparet hir one sone al-way, that atte last knowen hit was the verray sothe by suche afraye, And that Iudas ther bifore was founden the se-syde by. thenne was Iudas schomet sore, and slegh hys brother priuely, And flagh away in-to Iudee, when he had done felony. to Pilates court sone come he, and was receyuet hastyly; ffor ofte tyme a mon may se and is vset communely, thing that is like withe like wol be and to hit coueite kyndely, And for Iudas and Pilate als of maneres weren wel acording, screw to screw and fals to fals, Iudas to Pilate was likyng. So in-with a littel space that Iudas with hym was dwellyng, most maister of his hous he was and dispendour of al his thing. So hit by-felle opon a day Pilate in his palays stode and loke[t] aboute hym vche way on orchardes as hym thoght gode. Thenne was ther an orchard by in wiche were appele grete plente, and Pilate wilnet wonderly to ete of hom that ther segh he. Thenne that orchard that thay wer inne was Iudas fadur ?orde i-wys, and of tho appul forto wynne Iudas kest hym al amys. But that that ?orde hys faderes was Iudas had thenne no knowing, and Ruben hopet hys sone Iudas had ben ded and noght lyuyng. So Iudas for to plese Pilate and to fulfil hys foule delite, in-to that ?orde he tase his gate forto gete Pilate of that fruyte. Wil that he was that fruyte geting come Ruben, hys fader, segh hym there of hys appeles fast eting, and boun of hom away to bere, And chalanges Iudas of this thing ffor hys defaute hym for to fere; so after chiding was feghting, in wrathe th[a]y to-geder wer, So that, schortly for to say, Iudas slogh Ruben with a stone, and from that ?ort he tas the way withe appele[s] to Pilate anone, And told hym fully of thys caas, suche a mon how he had slayn; Pilate sayde syn hit so was, that wrecchednesse wer gode to layn. Sone when hit drogh toward night Ruben was soght witht his meisne, thenne was he fonden sone in hight lyyng dede vnder a tre, And thay supposeden fullyly on sodeyn dethe then dethet he, for at hys de[?]t was nomon by how he was slayne that might se. Thenne Pilate, that had ful power to mare wodowos wher he wold, Rubenes godes and wyf in fer he ?af hom Iudas, be ?e bolde. Thus Iudas has hys fadur slayne, weddet hys one moder in hy, so schope hyt for this schrewet swayne on vche syde vn-happily. ffer after thys opon a day Tyborea syket wonder sore, and Iudas wilnet by alway witte why ho syket and wher-fore. And ho sayde, âsir, alas! alas! vnhappy wommon most am I, for furst myne owen sone drowenet was that I bar of my body, âAnd sithen my husbonde in a caas deghet I not how sodeynly, wommon I hope more bowte grace nys noon lyuyng witterly.â When thay had talket bothe in fere, Iudas vmbythoght hym inwardly and by the wordes that spoken were knew hit wel and certaynely, Hys owen fader he had slayne and weddit hys moder eke as so, thenne wer thay nauther of hom fayne but in grete sorow bothe two. And by grete excitacioun of his moder, thenne went he to Ihesu and asket remissioun of his misdede, as reden we. ?ette Crist for his grete trespas made hym hys desciple tho, and after he apostel was and one of twelue about to go. And purueour in vche place he sches Iudas ymonges mo, but ay in his hert lafte a trace of couetyse that dyd hym wo. ffor purs-berer thenne was he, and what-ser gyuen was to Ihesu he receyuet hit, leue ?e me, and stele ther-of as Crist wel knew. So byfore Cristes passioun when Magdaleyne Ihesu anont withe riche vnement of renoun, Iudas displesit with that poynt, And sayd that vnement was worthy thre hu[n]dret penyes to be solde, and so riche thyng to destruye hym thoght hit euel done, be ?e bolde; ffor in his hert he fully keste to haue stolne the waleu of hyt, ther-fore hym thoght that clene lest ffor in hys purs hit was not putte. And that malice enduring, to the Iewes he went in hy and sold Ihesu our heuen keng for thrette pe[ny]es by enuy. &amp; ffor he vset had by-fore of Cristes gode the tethe to stele, ther-fore hym greuet wonder sore that he with hy[t] might not dele, And euen for als muche mony as teithe of hit wold come to, Ihesu Crist to hom sold he for hym thoght hyt was forto do. And this dede, as clerkes sayn, was opon next Wednesday by-fore that Ihesu suffert payne, and is one gode skyl sothe to say Why Wednesday men done penance more then other dayes by-fore, for that day Iudas hade meschaunce that greuet hym and soule sore. ffor when he had his lord by-trayde in wanhope he felle sone in hye, to hong hym-self sone he assayet, and had no grace to aske mercy. Thus endit this ilk schrewe Iudas and lyuet, as byfore sayde we, as mon that hade no might ne grace for his grate synne to sauet be. De resurrectione Christi. Now ys gode sumwat to say of Cristes resurectioun, that rose from deth the thridde day after he tholet hys passioun. To seuen poyntes wel I may haue consideracioun, that I schal er I go away ex[p]resly now to ow ex-poune. Circa ipsam resurectionem septem sunt consideranda. Primo qualiter verum sit, quod tribus diebus &amp; tribus noctibus in sepulcro iacuit &amp; die tercia resurexit. Secundo quare non statim vt mortuus est, resurexit, set vsque in diem tercium expectauit. Tercio, qualiter resurexit: Quarto quare resurectionem suam accelerauit nec vsque ad generalem resurectionem distulit: Quinto, propter quid resurexit: Sexto, resurgens quotiens apparuit: Septimo, quare sanctos patres, qui erant in limbo, inde eduxit &amp; quid ibi egit. Primo quomodo tribus diebus &amp; tribus noctibus iacuit in sepulcro. ffurst I may preue soth and verray that thre dayes and thre night in sepulcre Ihesu lay, and the thrydde day roos with might, As Austyne beres good wytenesse; thagh hit to be so wold not seme, ?e schun beleue that so hit was in this maner, as I schal deme. ffor ?e schun take the Gode Fryday by the later ende of hit, the Seterday al hole in fay, that open is to monnes wytte, The thridde day by the furst party, And thus thre dayes dede he lay, and vchone of these thre say I had his night by-for the day. ffor thenne by Bedus opinion cours of nightes chaunget wer, expresly as I schal expoune, takes hede and ?e moun her. ffor by-fore Cristes passioun the day went byfore the night, and after his passioun, leue ?e moun, the night by-fore goos by gode right. And this skil may alegget be, for when Adam by-gylet was, in-to thesternesse felle he ffrom the day of lyght and grace, and after-ward by Cristes payne and resurectioun, as I say, from night to day he come a?ayne, from gult to grace that lestes ay. Circa secundum sciendum, est quod conueniens fuit, vt non statim, quando mortuus fuit, Christus resurgeret set vsque in diem tercium expectaret, propter quinque raciones &amp; prima hec est. As to the secund in fay, why he ros not hastily, but abode the thridde day, ffyue skylles I fynd skylfully. The furst skil was in tokenyng That light of his dethe helet tho our double deth, by that doyng, of body and soule both two. Propter significacionem. And ther-fore one day ful enter and two nightes ded he lay, that by that day in gode maner skilfully vnderstonde I may The light that by hys deth con schowe to fadres that in helle wer, that double deth welle conen knowe, for bothe dethes thay suffert her. Then wer thay by hys dethe of light ffrom bothe dethes of thesternesse helet and restoret by right to that lyue that ys endelesse. Secundo propter probacionem. The secunde cause wyterly why Crist abode the thrydde day was forto preue no fantasy was in his werke but al werray, ffor right as two men other thre moun ber wittenesse of that sothe ys, so in thre dayes may preuet be that was werrayly ded i-wys. Tercio propter sue potestatis ostensionem. The thrid cause was forto schowe apertely what was his power, and men the s[o]the mighten knowe that he had told byfore here. Potestatem habeo ponendi animam meam &amp; iterum sumendi eam. He sayd byfore he had ful might forto put hys sole away and take hit efte a?ayne in hight, As he did the thrid day. Thenne had he resen up anone when soule was gone from his body, men schuld have leuet euerichone hit had ben but a fantasy, And that he was not werrayle dede, but supposit by sorcery that lyf had in hys body ben led and he schewet other sotily. Ther-fore to preue that mon might se that he was fully ded i-wys, he lay [in] sepulcre dayes thre and ros the thrid day with grete blisse. Quarta propter restaurandorum purificacionem. the furthe cause whi he wold not rise er the thridde day comen wer, was for to schow that al his weren restoret in heuen and her, And that he wold thurght his aprise puryfy suche as by prayer and gode werkes werne ay wyse to dred hym and be to hym dere. As Petre Rauenne wel con say, In Latyn as I shal specify, And after in Englisch more verray for lewet men that her ben by: Petrus Rauennas: Tres enim dies voluit esse sue sepulture, que in celo sunt, restauraturus, que in terra, reparaturus, &amp; que apud inferos, reparaturus. Thre daies he sais that Crist wold be In sepulcre lying as he was, ffor into heuen restore wold he monkynde, that gylt, to gete hom gras, And in erth reperaile eke thyng that mon-kynde did amys, thurgh his deth Ã¾at was so meke teche hom redy way to blis, And out of helle als to forby tho Ã¾at long time Ã¾er hade bene, therfore thre daies he wold so lye til Ã¾es thre places wer ouer-sene. Quinto propter triplicis status iustorum representacionem. The fift cause may wel be this, qvy he abode with his risyng, to represent, nothing amys, the states of holi mennus lyuyng. And this skil showes Gregory, that God tholet opon Friday, Seterday he in pes con ly, Sonday ros in body verray. so this lif Ã¾at we ben inne to Friday wel may liknet be, for wo ne trauail neuer wil blyn qvil Ã¾at in Ã¾is wold ben we. But Seterday, ri?t as Ihesu lay in sepulcre rest takyng, so shal we alle that ben trewe And of clene lif her lyuyng, Gost &amp; flesch in rest lye from bodily deth to domus-day, therfore Seterday skilfully to that time likken I may. The Sonday Crist ros skilfully In body &amp; saule both in fer, so shyn we alle, as leue I, rise from deth thur?e his power. And body &amp; saule to-gedir be clarifiet from alle trespas, And then fulle ioy bout sorowe se, qvich ioy shal neuer from vs pas. Ther-fore by skil to represent wo on Fryday, as saide we, rest on Setterday, as I kent, ioy on Sonneday ful to be, To this lif we bene inne lent and after this lif to leue in lee til the day of iuggement, I likken wel these dayes thre. Circa tercium qualiter resurexit. Nota quod resurexit potenter, feliciter, vtiliter, mirabiliter &amp; veraciter. Now is to wytte wyterly the thrid poynt I speke of her, as I haue lornit, telle wol I how he ros and what maner. He roos, I may say, mightily, and blessetly thenne he hym ber, profitable, and wonderly, and sothely, as I schal ow ler. That he roos mightily i-wys witnesse Iohan the ewangiliste, that in his gospel writes this, that Crist sayd, as he herd and wiste: Iohannes ix?: Potestatem habeo ponendi animam meam &amp; iterum sumendi eam. Et iterum: Soluite templum hoc &amp; in tribus diebus reedificabo illud. He sayde, âI haue a ful power to leue my saule and take a?ayn,â and that was sene fully her when that he ros with soiche a mayn. Also the Iewes weren wel blent withe a word that he con say, the whiche he speke in one entent, another vnderstoden thay. ffor the temple he bad destruye, and he wold after in dayes thre hit a?ayn wel edifye that alle men schuld sothely ce. Ther wer the Iewes sotily bigilet in that worde that sayde he, for he spake of his owen body that verray temple migh callet be; And thay supposit alle amys that of a temple spoken he had, but ?ette his worde, forsothe i-wys, At his vp-rising sothe he made. Secundo surrexit f[elic]iter, quia de-posita omni miseria. Also Crist o-ros blessetly, for he wayuet al wrechednesse at hys rising, as preue may I by Iohanes gospel her expresse. Iohannis xxvi?: Postquam autem resurexero, precedam vos in Galeleam. Gallelea enim interpretatur transmigracio. For Crist sayd when he risen wer he wold go into Galile, that betokenes, ?e moun ler, twynnyng-away as then did he. ffor Crist twynned fro wrecchednesse at his rising to go to blisse, from corrupcioun to clannesse; from wordely wo to wel i-wis. Tertio resurexit vtiliter, quia capta preda. the thridde manere of his rising was profitable, that nys no nay, &amp; that preues his owen doyng and wordus that him-self con say. Iohannis xij: Cum exaltatus fuero, a terra omnia traham ad me ipsum. âwhen I am hauset,â as says he, âfrom the erthe gostely that day, all thing I wil dragh with me and how, expressely I wol say.â That is as mych to vnderstond, when his saule from body went, to drawe from helle wold he not wond his men that in that place were lent. &amp; that dede profitable was, for ther as lyon he toke pray, as Ieremie gode mynd mas by proficie, as I shal say. Ieremie iiij?: Ascendit leo de cubili suo et predo gentium se leuauit. The proficie likenes Ihesu here to a lyon helpyng men, &amp; sais to take pray with powere the lyon rose out of his denne. Quarto resurexit mirabiliter, quia remanente clauso sepulcro. The furthe maner wonderful was, when he from dethe to lyue rose, for bodely out of that place he went, &amp; sepulcour fully close. For ry?t as he went clos body out of his modur womb i-wys, so close sepulcour sicurly he went out of, ?e leue wel this. We reden a tale wel acordyng Narracio ut in historiis. in the storys writen expresse to this mater, as I shal myng, that in Rome a monk ther was in sain Laurence abbay dwellyng outwith the walles of that cite, that wondert on Cristes vp-rising clos sepulcour, how hit my?t be. And as he meruailet so on hit, his girdil fel from him away no thing broken ne vnknyt But hole bifore him ther hit lay. Than spake a voice to him on hi?t, and said, âCrist my?t in that manere for to passe out be so slegh Clos sepulcour thurgh his powere.â Ri?t as his girdel that was teghet ffrom him holly went, so my?t Crist his sepulcour feghet passe out thurgh my?t most excellent. Quinto resurexit veraciter, quia in corpore vero et proprio. The fyft maner that rose he was sothely, as I ere con say, in that self body, leue ?e me, that deghet before on Gode Friday. That this is soth ?e shin wele se, in six maners as preue I may by ful gode autorite, and that his risyng was verray. Furst by gode angel that wol not lye, sithen by diuerse aperyng to his discipuls bodyly that wittenessen hit no lesyng, The thrid preuet apertely by his eting &amp; drynkyng that hit was by no sorcery ne deceyt in that doyng. The furth maner by felyng was And hondelyng of his woundes wide And that witnes saynt Thomas that put his honde into his side, And therby mon may ful wel se that he ros in that selue body that de?et bifore on rode tre And born was of a virgyn Mary. The fifte by dropes rennyng doun on iche side, as wel was sene, that he hade in his passioun, As shewiden after al by-dene; As rede Ã¾e dropes wer rennyng quen he was risen Ã¾e thrid day As thai wer at his gost endyng that preuet he was in flesch verray. The sixt scowyng sothely was when that he geet a large entre stoken ?ates in-to that place ther-as to-geder were his meisne, And that point preuet apertely that glorifiet thenne roos he in puret flesche so fullyly that might no way appairet be, And in suche flesche, as leue I, at domesday alle rise schun we that worthy ben to haue mercy and worldely folyes wel conen fle. The seuent point wel preues her Paulus epistel apertely, that he wol neuer bye vs so dere ny degh, saue regne ay noght dedly. Ad Romanos vj?: Christus resurgens ex mortuis iam non moritur, mors illi vltra non daminabitur. De sancto Dionisii. Neuer-the-latter sayn Denys in a pistel that sent he to Themople holy men and wyse Reherces this tale that ?e schun se: That aftur Cristes ascensioun A holy man that Carpus hight lyuet in grete deuocioun, to whiche Crist spake on a ny?t, And saide he was ?ette redy to suffer deth for monnes hele, and hym-self told expressely, The whiche wol I no?t concele. Carpus that ilk holi mon told saynt Denys what he segh, and [I] wol telle so as I con what seght he segh in heuen on hegh. Hit felle ther Carpus was wonyng A paynym turnet hade sotily A Cristen mon from gode leuyng to leue opon fals mavmetrye, And when Carpus herd of this thing in hert he hade ful grete any, and by-cause of that turnyng in greete sekenesse he felle ther-by. We reden that mon so holy was, As says Denys in his lessoun, that euer when he song his masse ffrom heuen he hade sum visioun, So alle tymes he con praye for these two men that cumbert wer, and ones in bedde as he laye bifelle this caas that ?e schun her. Hym thoght so he legh, sodenly the hous departet ewen in two, and a fuyr grete and horribly schowet euen a-boue hym tho. Thenne loket he vp and heuen segh he alle open, and Ihesu syttyng whit aungels in his deite Alle abowte that euen kynge. Then the two men ful ruthfully wer befor that fuyr stondyng, for ferd of payne so negh hom bye all way criyng and wakyng. Out of that fuyr fast conen flye grete nedderis bright chynyng, in and out ful horriblely, and tho two men fast manassing. When that Carpus segh this case he hade so grete delite ther-inne, that of sight in other place he hade no mynd opon to mynne, For alle his wille fulle was that thay wer chaysteset for hor synne, and fayn he wold for hor trespas thai hade bien cast that fuyr withynne. Thenne as he loket to heuen blis, he segh Crist on hom hade mercy, and from the heghest trone i-wys went doun wit Aungels ioyfullye, And for?af hom hor doyng mysse. thenne to th[i]s holy m[o]n in hye Crist spake that her wreten his, in Englisce as declar wol I: Manu extenta percute contra me de celo, Paratus sum pro hominibus saluandis pati. âPutte furthe thi honde,â sayde Crist tho, âAnd smyte aftur me in hye, for ?ette to saue mon-kynd of wo Eft to deth I am redy. âAnd alle for loue I haue to mon so loth me wer thai wer for-lorn, but ?ette bees not to bold theron to synne, as these men dedyn beforn.â And cause why this tale told is, ys for that worde that Crist saide her, that for to bryng mon-kynde to blisse he wold eft degh to make hom dere. Circa quartum, quare non expectauit cum aliis resurgere, quando fiet generalis resurrectio. As to the furthe poynt, is to knaw whi Crist abode not for to rise at domesday, when alle schun showe whiche wer wrongwis, wheche wer wise. Primo propter corporis dignitatem. [And for thre causes, ?e shul se,] tary his rising wold he no?t the fur[s]te, be-cause of dignite of his body that vs for-boght. for sithen that hit in godhede was wit mon-hede maynet thurgh his mercy, hit wold not seme, as in that caas, vnder vrthe so long to lye. Therfor the Sauter spekes oright acordyng to this ilk mater, and sais that holy body so bright Schal no corrupcioun com ner, Psalmus: Non dabis secundum tuum videre corrupcionem corpus deificatum. Secundo fidei firmitatem. The secounde cause, to mende the faye, for hade [he] not risen in dayes three, no mon hade leuet hym god werray, But falsehede all thing that dyd he. and that was sene apertely in his disciples euerichone, for saue onely in oure ladye Sad beleue was in neuer one. but when thai knwen he risen was, thenne be-leuet thai fullilly, as Paules epistel mynde maas, as and in Latyn wol chewe I: Ad Corintheos xv: Si Christus non resurexit, vana est fides nostra. But ?if that Crist hade risen i-wisse, As Paule sais in Latyn here, alle our faith hade ferd on mysse n[o]ght hade bien leuet that he couth ler. Tercio propter nostre resurrectionis exemplari[ta]tem. the thridde cause was this in fay, vs to take ensavmpel bye that we schun rise the last daye right as he did thurgh his mercy. for nad he resen as he did tho, no mon wold haue leuet on right when gost hade [gone] our body fro, that euer hit schulde theder eft light. therfor Paule beres witnesse, in Latyn as I schal sone saye, that right as Crist vp-risen was, so schuld we rise the last daye. Si Christus &amp; nos resurgemus. Circa quintum propter quid resurexit. nota. The fift cause principaly wherfor he rose wit shal ?e, for iiij thinges nedefully he rose, as ?e schun sone se. for furst his resurrectioun was cause of treuth a[n]d rightwisnesse to synneful men, ?e leuen moun, the whiche the deule broght in distresse. and therto Paule acordes oright, and says he slayn was for our synne, but he rose the thridde night by right a?ayne vs for-to wynne. Ad Romanos iiij?: Traditus est propter delicta nostra &amp; resurexit propter iustificacionem nostram. his resurectioun eke also taght vs to leue a nwe leuyng, and oure maneres chaunget tho from euel to gode in mony thing, as the Apostel telles expresse, âRight as Crist rose to blisse, so to nwe lif of all godenes he wilnes [vs] for to walk i-wisse.â Ad Romanos vj?: Sicut Christus resurrexit a mortuis per gloriam patris, ita nos in nouitate vite ambulemus. also his ressurrectioun Engendres hope of for?eu[n]es, and of soule saluacioun in that ioy that is endles. Therto acordes Petre here in A pistel that he sent, the Latyn furste I schal ow ler, and Englise thenne, in myn entent. Petri secundo: Qui propter magnam manum suam regenerauerunt nos in spem vite per resurectionem. âGod thurgh his mercy that alle may, Engendret vs at his rising To hope of lif that lastes aye, and blisse that neuer schal haue endyng.â his resurectioun eke also ys euidence to mon verray That body and saule both two, mon-kynde sal rise the last day, For, as the Apostel spekes her, by mon come deth to al his kynde, and dede schul rise whitouten wer thurgh him bodely, as I finde. Ad Corintheos xv?: Christus resurexit a mortuis primicie dormiencium, quoniam quidem per hominem mors &amp; per hominem resurrectio mortuorum. Now four prerogatyues her I wil reherce las &amp; more, Acordyng to tho four in fer that I saide ri?t now bifore, that Ihesu hade &amp; neuer non mo, ny none mi?t haue, by gode resoun, saue onely he hade hym-self tho At his resurrectioun. The first is Ã¾at Ã¾e last day from deth to lyue rise shyn we, but Ihesu in sepulcre lay no bot only daies thre. That oÃ¾er prerogatif is this, that he ros by his owen power, but ?if Ã¾at we shyn rise I-wys, his mi?t most help in al maner. The thridde is Ã¾at our flesch shal fall In-to povder er our risyng, but his Ã¾at de?et for vs alle may not roote for no thing. The furth poynt is, in gode fay, that his resurrectioun dos comfort, Ã¾at we leue may by hit our saule saluacioun, And that we shyn Ã¾e last day, quen he to deme vs all is boun, thur?e hym rise in flesch verray, for thur?e our owen mi?t we ne moun. Circa sextum quociens apparuit. As to Ã¾e sixt poynt sikerly, how oft he shewid hym, I wil say fiue sith fully, as rede I, he apperide the first day. And fyue sith after witerly, As I shal telle er I go way, so that ten sith truly he shewide hym, that nys no nay. first he apperide, as sais sayn Ion And Mathew also beris witnes, bifore his brether euerychone, to Mavdelayn that synful wes: Surgens Ihesus mane prima sabbati apparuit primo Marie Magdalene. Marcus vltimo. Tipum gerit penitencium. And ho beris liknes be our lore of synful men now her lyuyng, that syn forsaken &amp; wil no more, to showe thai shyn haue for?yuyng. I fynde that Crist wold first apper for fyue causes to Mavdelayn, Apparuit Ihesus Marie Magdalene. the first is for ho louede enter, neuer non more, ys not to layn; And therof Luke beris witnes of mony synnes ho hade mercy, And of Ihesu for?ifnes, by cause ho lufd so tenderly. Dimissa sunt ei peccata multa, quoniam dilexit multum. Lucas vij?. The secunde cause wel preue I may bi his owen word, as reden we, fforto showe in dede verray for synful men Ã¾at de?et he. Non veni vocare iustos set peccatores. Matheus ix?. The thrid cause was wyterly, for comune wymmen, Crist sais her, that menden hom &amp; han mercy passen wise men, bout wer, In heuen &amp; in Ã¾at endles blis qven thai ben clanset of hor syn, sayn Mathew witnes beres of this, In Latyn as I shal ?ou myn: Amen dico vobis quia publicani &amp; peccatores &amp; meretrices precedent sapientes in regno celorum. Matheus xi?. the f[ifte] cause skilful was, Sithen wommon was a messager forto bryng deth on plas, As Eue did in foul maner, An-other woman ful of grace, as Mare Maudelayn was her, Schulde comford careful in this case to telle his rising to his der. the furthe hit was i-wis that God wold grace wer ther plente, as synne hade bien and doyng mysse, therfore to hir aperet he. Herto acordes Paule oright, and says ther gult hade greuet sor, grace was grete and was vngright ther-as fulthe hade bien before. Ad Romanos v?: Vbi habundauit delictum, superabundauit &amp; gracia. the secounde tyme aperet he To two Maries hom comyng, That at the sepulcre hym to se haden bien whit sor syking. But when thai misset hym, leue ?e me, thai wenten A?ayn bothe remymg; then saide Ihesu wit hert fre, âAl hail,â to hom A?ayn turnyng. Then weren hor hertes ful of blis, and touchet his fete deuoutely, ther Mavdelayn befor i-wys touchet hym noght, as wel rede I. And these wymmen, as clerkes sayn, tokenen mekenysse, leue ?e maye, for wemen fallen wel to be bayn as God ordaynet, to monnes paye. The thridde tyme he con appere to Petre, but when knowen not we, and holi chirche als his in were in what place aperet he. But hit might wele falle i-wis whenne he tournet wit Iohn A?ayn, as clerkes opinioun fulle his, from the sepulcre, as thai sayn. Petre twinnet ther from Iohan and turnet by another way, thenne aperet Ih[esu] anone to Petre as mon, leue ?e may. Therfor Petre wel may ber liknesse of hom that woln be buxum heuen keng to her, for that wertu fulle hade he. The feurthe apering was aftre noon to his disciples sor mournyng, toward Enaus when he come sone To comfort hom in hor goyng. And tho disciples moun signifie Suche as willeful pouert han, and woln fulfille mekely His worde and hold that thai han tane; For God biddes selle that Ã¾ou has and giffe to por men wit gode wille, then his disciple t[he] he maas, ?if thou that biddyng wolt fulfille. Wade &amp; vende omnia, que habes &amp; da pauperibus. the fift tyme, in gode fay, to his disciples aperet he whenne thai wer to-?edur that daye, in Iohannes gospel as Ã¾ou may se. Iohannes xxv? And that betokenes, clerkes sayn, Religiouse mennes lif on right wit ?ates stoken, as wol do gayn, of hor fyue wittes day &amp; night. And thus Ihesu these tymes fyue Schewet hym that ilk day that he rose from deth to lyue, And aftur a four, as I schal say. But these fyue showynges her Representes a prest i-wys that in his masse in gode maner Fyue sythe hym turnes, as vset ys, to the pepul that thai moun se his viceage and sum-what sayng, but at the thridde tyme noght says [he] That comes to hor her ny hering; and that betokenes trwly the thridde shoyng Petre [to], that was done al priueli, therfor the prest ay so con do; ffor holychirche fulle bileue has that to Petre aperet he, but what tyme &amp; in what place is not wel knowen leue ?e me. The sixte sithe on the heght daye Apperet Ihesu to hom vchone, Thomas wit hom and not awaye, the ?ates alle stoken of that wone; For Thomas hade saide before he nold not leue in no maner, til he hade sene his wondes sor and felet hom to witte hit so wer. Iohannes xx?: Cum esset sero die illo. and this shoyng to sayn Thomas betokenes men myssebeleuyng and dredyng right as Thomas Significauit esitan[tes] in fide. The faithe that Crist in vrthe con bring. the seuent sithe, sothe for to say, to his disciples apparet he as thai weren fysshing, in gode fay, by Iohanes gospel know may we. Iohannis vltimo. And that showyng he showet hym then prechours wel may signifie, For thai bien fisshers made of men, to heuen thurgh hom that Ã¾ai moun hie. The heght sithe he showde hym tho, as Matheu sais, in brether sight apon a hulle ther he con go, The whiche hulle that Tabor hight. Mathei vltimo. And that [b]e-tokenes trewly Men in grete contemplacioun, that [han] hor mynde assiduelly on dedes of deuocioun. For on that hulle, as reden we, transfiguret was God almight, as in the gospel mon may se wo-seuer wil rede all on right. the nient sithe was, in gode fay, at a soper-place as thai were opon the assencioun daye, When [he] repreuet in gode maner ho[r] misbileue and hard hert also [Ã¾at Ã¾ey hadden to leue aright, For ay Ã¾ey hoped sum-what fals] that apertely seghen in sight, And shewyng of [him] tho Synful men may signifie, [Ã¾at at the laste God casteÃ¾ from wo] And bringes hom to his mercy. Marci vltimo. the tente sithe that aperet he and the last, I ow behete, was that day he to heuen con fle in the mounte of Oliuyte. Luce vltimo. Whiche disciples ther beyng Signifien men ful of mercy, And louyng Godde in alle thing, ffor no nede dredyng ne any. and from that place to heuen blisse he stegh fro hom ful myghfulli, whiche blisse let vs not misse That al this did as told haue I. thre other shoynges wel [I] finde that fallen opon Astur-day, that I schal telle wil I haue mynde, but in no gospel sette bien thai. The first shoynge of hym wasse to the lasse Iame i-wisse, as his legent mynde maas and Ierom witnesse hit so is. And Iesephus witenesses [ek]e also on Gode Friday when Crist was deed, Iames made a uow tho That he wold neuer ete no brede Til his lord Crist risen wer from deth wit ful might, whiche auow trwly enter He held til then as he hade hight. But thenne opon the thridde day Crist aperet to hym in sight, And spake to hom Ã¾at seruet hym ay, A borde &amp; brede that Ã¾ai shuld di?t. Quen borde was sett &amp; brede Ã¾er-on, Crist blesside Ã¾at brede deuoutly, And toke hit Iame to bite opon, And saide Ã¾at now reherce wil I: âRise vp brother,â he saide onon, âAnd ete to comfort Ã¾e Ã¾er-by, for Ihesu Crist both god &amp; mon Is risen &amp; her is neghe Ã¾e by.â AnoÃ¾er time apperit he to Ioseph Abaramathy, As apertly mon may se In Nichodemus euangely. ffor quen Ã¾e Iewis se?en Ã¾is, that Ioseph for Ihesu con pray, his body dede &amp; ful of blis In sepulcre forto lay, And Pilate grauntide hade so hym, And Ioseph Ihesu honouret hade, the Iewes wexen wonder grym And mych mournyng made; And token Ioseph priuely, In-to a prison thai hym pytt, with lokkes &amp; barres bisily the dores Ã¾ai steken &amp; fast shytt, And tho?ten after Ã¾e sabot day to sle hym for that ilk dede, but Crist delyueret hym away, As ?e shul her qvo-so wol hede. ffor Ihesu come that selfe ny?t that was his resurreccioun with four angels shynyng bry?t, And entride into Ã¾at prisoun, Wi[pe]t his visage cusside hym tho And lad hym out, no lok vndone, til he come to his hous hom fro In Arimathy &amp; that ful sone. the thrid shewyng, as leue we, that first was don of alle ichone, was to Mary his modir fre thagh mynde in gospel made be none. And Ã¾at wel preues Ã¾e chirch of Rome, for onon Ã¾e selue day thai worshipide his vp-rist &amp; come, with solempne processioun Ay to a chirch of Our Lady, erly on Aster-day Ã¾ai gone, quich goyng may signifie he showide to hir bifore ichone. And if this wel ne leuet wer that Crist apperit first to Mary, hit wold seme he come not ner ther ho was that time witerly; And that may noway leuet be that Crist did so vnkyndly, al-thagh mon may not fynde ne se writen in none euangely, Euel semes hit sich a son as he shuld for-?ete his moder in ny, And showe hym to alle his meyne And hir that best was let go by, But Ã¾is opinion wil not falle, And clercus hopen in this cas tha?e Ã¾e euangelistes alle of this mater no mynde masâ ffor hit fel for hor offys to write hom that my?t witnes ber, but modir for sone no laghe lys to take for witnes ne to swerâ But for thai hopide hit no nede to sett in gospel that doyng, thai laft hit as thyng done in dede alle men in hit to haue leuying. Septimo &amp; vltimo qualiter Christus sanctos patres, qui erant in limbo, adduxit &amp; quid ibi egerit. Nota bene. As to Ã¾e seuent poynt &amp; Ã¾e last of Goddes risyng to take hede, to telle how he to he[ll]e past And quat he Ã¾er did, hit is nede. Al-tha?e no gospel speke of hit, As Austin sais now tell wol I, and als how Nicodemus wit writes in his euangeley. Austin says that Crist anone as he hade ?olden the gost on rode, his soule and godhede bothe alone, he went to helle for monnes gode. Augustinus: Vnita sue deitati ad infernorum profunda descendit. When he as robbur comen was schynyng and ferdful on to se, adred deueles in that place and askeden vchone, what was he that was so grym and ful of grace Apertely preuyng his pouste; âso afright of monnes face,â thai saiden alle, âneuer ?ette wer we. âthe world sent vs neuer such a mon ded ne whik as is he this, for no ferdchip is hym opon, he comes wit so muche blis. âWho is this,â alle saiden thai, âthat comes to vs and has no drede our sorow that we hauen to assaie but oÃ¾er helpe[s] in grete nede? âfor suche as wer wit vs in wo hauen grete ioy for hope of hele, and alle hor drede is klene Ago, Manassing vs that bien so feele. âSo proude ded men weer neuer her ny so ioyful prisoneres.â thus spake all hell to Lucifer, herkenes now alle men and heres: âthow prince of vs that schuldest be, thi comfort failes fullely, to greuaunce turnet is thi gle, as showes in sight apertely. âfor to hong Crist opon a tre thow wost neuer what may falle Ã¾er-by, for euerlesting wo to the by hym now comes the to destrie.â when helle hade made this careful ber, Anone at Cristes bidding there alle the bondes broken were of helle ?ates hom to fere. thenne comen al doun kneling Wit-owt noumbre Ihesu to pray, whit deleful noys and sor remyng schowyng hor gref, as I schal say. âLord comen ard Ã¾ou as wilnet han we for to bring vs out of helle, let vs not be away from the when thow to heuen gose ther to deuelle. âStegh hup, lord, in-to thi blisse, when helle is spoliet of his pray and prince of hit ouercomen is, bring liking to the worlde for Aye. âHelp vs of pyne that we byn inne, and vnbynde that wrecchet bien, assoile gulty of hor synne, and saue hom now as may be sene.â These writes saint Austyn that I haue now rehercet her, herkenes now for loue myne what Nichodemus vs con ler. he telles in his euangely that when Crist rose on Astur day, two men risen from deth in hie that self tyme, as I schal saye. Symeones sones thowe men wer, that Ihesu in-to the tempel toke whenne Mare purifiet was her on Candelmasday, as sais the boke. Carinus I finde that one son hight, the tother Leuicius callet was, that from deth risen that self ny?t and comen to Annas &amp; Cayphas, to Nichodemus, &amp; Ieseph eke, and coniuret tham sothe to saye, thing that [thai] told wit hert meke How Crist to helle come that day. âwhen that we weren in thesternesse whit our forfaderes,â saiden thai, âsodeynly rose A grete brightnesse Imung vs alle ther, in gode fay. âGold heewet sunne Ã¾en semet hit, that so in helle opon vs schone that Adam and all in pyne knytte maden grete ioy &amp; blisse vchone. âThenne saide Adam, âthis ilk light comes fro Gode whit-outen ende, that light euer-lesting vs bihight, when he to wynne vs dovn wold wende.â âThen onon criet Isaye And saide, âÃ¾is li?t from heuen is sent, from God as I in prophecy tolde in erth quen I was lent.â Populus qui ambulabat in tenebris vidit lucem magnam, habitantibus in regione vmbre mortis lux orta est eis. âThen spak Ã¾e ri?twis Symeon our owen fadir,â saiden Ã¾ay, âAnd saide, âlord, I am Ã¾at mon that Ã¾e receyuet soth to say ââInto Ã¾e temple, now is gone thritty ?er &amp; thre in fay, And as Ã¾e Holi Gost onon ta?t me, I song Ã¾at ilk day.â Nunc dimittis &amp;c. âAfter Ã¾at an armet come And saide hym-self he hi?t Ion, that Crist baptist &amp; out-nome of Ã¾e watir of flem Iordon, âAnd saide he went to ordeyn way bifore Cristes comyng der, And with his fynger, in gode fay, he showet &amp; saide, âlo, his lomb her, ââThat shal put away that syn that our first fadir wro?t.â And that he come hom Ã¾er to myn to viset hom he was in tho?t.

For suche a sorow fel in hor scher and mennes ?erdes eke also, that from that wo might none hym wer, suche suelling ther thai haden tho. So bitter was that maledye hit slogh men goyng in the waye, at speche to-gedur sodenly, At mete sittyng, &amp; eke in play. and when a mon began to nese, wit that nesing deghet he, also a mon his life schuld lese wit ?oskyng eke, as reden we. Therfore when any mon ?osking was, who-seuer herd to hym wold renne, and say, âGod helpe the ful of grace,â by-cause of meschef that was thenne. [And ?it Ã¾at vsage vsed ys ?yf a man to ?oske be-gynne, Who-so ys negh, he vseth this] To say, âGod help,â on that to mynne. Therfor when any mon schal nese, Anone he blesses hym be-for, for ferd lest he h[i]s lif schuld lese, As tho men so deden thor. Causa pestilencie inseritur. Now to knaw [how] this sorow come that I haue specifiet her to men wonyng then in Rome, I wol telle [?]ow now enter. The water that ther rennes aye, that the name Tibre has, wex so bre[m]e, in gode fay, that ouer the walles hit flowet was, Kest doun houses, castiles also, for nedders ther boute novmbre wer and A grete dragon did hom wo and made hit me[ue] in that maner. Thenne wit grete strenth of streme, the nedders wer dreuen mony beside and dede stonken, no mon might go that way but who schulde hym betide. So sone the ayer so filet wasse whit wenym of hom mor &amp; mor, that pestilence felle in that place thre maneres, as I told before. So cruel was that corrupcioun that sum mon wel might se in sight the arowes from the air com doun and opon diuerse men light. And one the furst that thenne was slayn was Pelagius the pope, and aftur the peple, nis not to layne, witouten novmbur mon may hope. So mony wer slayn in Ã¾at cite that houses wer woide, no mon inne, and mony one thethen conen fle from house and castil fayn to twinne. But when Romaynes seghen this that hor pope so perischet was, a-nother thai mosten chose i-wys to rule hom and pray for Ã¾at place; Anone schosen saint Gregori A?aines his wille, as ?e schun her. anone he ordaynet letany, and for this pestilence praier, And a monithe uche mon Whit-outen stintyng for to pray, but ?ette continuet hit opon and men degheyng day for day. But ?ette Gregori ful of grace made solenne processioun, and bade hom stint for no cas to pray wit ful deuocioun. When processioun endet was, Gregory kest him for to ffle, for he thoght for no manace pope of Rome schuld he not be. When Romaynes knewen of this kast, thai commavndet anone tho for to steke the ?ates fast, That Gregori schuld no way go. So at the last then chaunget he his clethyng in a new aray, and gaue marchaundes muche mone to help him that he wer away. So in a tunne putte was he and theryine in a cart he lay, so geete he oute of that cite and wildernesse soght, sothe to say. So in a caue hidde he was and thre dayes ?orne soght, for other pope in that place thenne Gregory wold thai noght. so inwhit the thridde day an hermet segh a sunne-beme &amp; aungels comyng and going ay Gloriousely aftur that gleme, And euen vmbec[l]ippet all Ã¾at caue, ther-as Gregory was hudde; thenne told he hom that he wold haue thai schulde finde him in Ã¾at stud. Anone thider the peple went and founden as the armet saide, hertfully out thai him hent and beren him to the chirche with a braide, Sacret him, sette him in see, and pope of Rome thai him made; a?ayn his wille, rede we, that ilk dignite he hade. but ?ette aftur he pope was that pestilence was violent, thenne ordeinet ther sone he [h]as processioun, wit gode entent, In tyme of Paske vset to be, In whiche processioun was born an ymage of Our Lady fre lest alle the peple wer for-lorne. and that ymage, rede we, Sancta Maria callet hisse, in ara celi, leue ?e me, Saint Luke hym-self wroght hit i-wys, was none so like to Our Lady of alle ymages that euer wer wroght, and that ymage sollen[pn]eley befor the processioun was broght. And as thai forthe whit hir went the foule ayr aye went before, and clerchippe in the firmament Schowet alle waye mor &amp; more, So that hit semet to mennes sight that the foule ayr flagh awaye, and of Our Lady was a-fright to duelle ther lengur ther a day. thenne in the ayr aboute Mary wer herd Aungels suetely singyng this song that now reherce wol I, this blisful burd aboute bryngyng: Regina celi letare alleluia, quia quem meruisti portare alleluia, surrexit, sicut dixit alleluia. &amp; addidit Gregorius: Ora pro nobis alleluia. âwhene of heuen, enioyes now the wit alleluya, swete lady, for as he saide, resen is he that Ã¾ou to ber was worthi.â Thenne this song, as ?e schun se, addet the gode saint Gregory, âpray God for vs, thow lady fre,â Thus endet he this molodye. And euer after in-to this day Gregory ordeynet Ã¾at selue song on Paske tyme to be sungun aye ffor offertory hit to fong. whene the processioun comen was to a castel Crescence hight, Gregory segh stonde in Ã¾at place an aungel of heuen fair &amp; bright, A blody sworde in honde he hade and hit ther wippet ther in his sight, in signe of mediacioun made in-to his scaubert he hit pight; And euer sithen Ã¾at castel strong Castel Aungel callet has bene in mynde of mercy hom i-mong Of that aungel ther was sene. Nowe to the secounde poynt go we and speke of this processioun that seuen his, ?e schun se, thurgh Gregories constitucioun. for seuen ordres in hit made he in hor goyng thurgh the tovne; in the furst cours, leue ?e me, Wer clerkes and men of grete renoun, in the secounde monkes wer and other men of religioun, in the thridde nonnes in fer Doing hor deuocioun, in the feurthe alle innocence, in the fift alle lewde men, in the sixt widoes continence, In the seuent all weddet thenne. Thus ordainet hole Gregory in seuen parties men to pray, but vs behoues whit letany Fulfille that we whit men ne may. Tercio dicitur cruces nigre. the thridde [nome] this letany has, blake croyces callet ys, in signe of that ther then was, Hit has wele this nome i-wis. for croices and aulter? hulet wer all whit blak thurgh that cite, and men cladde in the selue maner alle in blak bothe ho and he. De letania minori. An-other letany vset ys, is callet the lasse letany, befor the Ascensioun i-wis thre dayes done sollenpnely. The whiche mynde sayn Mamert made, that bischop of Viegne was, befor that Rome this meschef hade or letany was in that place. and this lasse letany as the tother as nomes thre, lasse letany the furst, rede I, rogaciones also callen we, Processioun the thridde name hit has, now whi ?e schun wel se, as boke and vsage mynde mase vche ?er thurgh Cristiante. lasse letany callet hit ys for to make a difference betwene the mor &amp; hit iwis, that is worth mor reuerence. for the mor ordeynet Gregory and a bischop ordeinet this, therfor I may calle skilfully this the lasse, no thing amys, Syn mon of lasse autorite ordeynet this in porer place, and for lasse mischef, leue ?e me, then afterwarde in Rome was; so sythen Ã¾at he Ã¾at ordeynt hit And place &amp; myschef las was tho, I may skilfully by my wit calle hit Ã¾e las of Ã¾es two. Causa huius institucionis. Now Ã¾e cause knowe shyn ?e of Ã¾is institucioun, And for quat wo in that cite was ordeynt this processioun. At Viegne Ã¾at time Ã¾er was erth-qvake so wonder violent, And al bilt thing in that plas felle doun &amp; mich peple shent. Also ther was herd in ny?t clamour &amp; crie &amp; wonder soun, that made the peple foul afri?t that wer wonyng in that toun. Also anoÃ¾er dredful thing in that cite Ã¾er con falle, fuyr flagh from heuen bri?t brennyng And brende Ã¾e kynges palays alle. AnoÃ¾er veniaunce eke Ã¾er-ine shewide hym for monnus syn, deules enterede into swyne And into wolues men to wyn, And when Ã¾e deules enteride wer Ã¾o bestes dredden for no men, but ronnen about Ã¾er &amp; her In cites &amp; in feldes Ã¾en, And worieden Ã¾er mony A wi?t, olde &amp; ?ong, mon &amp; wommon, child &amp; best, day &amp; ny?t, Ã¾at Ã¾ai my?t lay toth opon. When sich sorowful cas bitid, Anone after day for day the bischop con comaunde &amp; bidde, to olde &amp; ?ong, wif &amp; may, fforto go with processioun, And ichone penyblie to pray, And made als institucioun letany to syng &amp; say. so cesset Ã¾is tribulacioun And ordeynt was after for ay, Thurgh popes confirmacioun to serue Ã¾at wone after alway. This letany also callide is rogaciouns resonably, for alle sayntes help I-wys we sechen in that letany. And ?if I shal not say amys, this time we done hit worthily, fasten &amp; praien for heuen blis And lifly helpe als bodily. Mony causes alegge I may, the furst is Ã¾e fende to destry, that this time of Ã¾e ?er alway Is about monkynde to nye. The secunde cause of hour praier and fasting to plese God al-might, that tendre fruytes on vrthe her moun growe and multiply oright. The thride flesshele temptacioun that this tyme most habundant ys, to sle monly &amp; bring hit doun, lest we done that maner amys. The feurthe that we vchone schul the mor worthi be to receyue in vs anone the Holy Gost whit hert fre, that sone aftre schal be sent, for fasting Ables mon therto &amp; praye[r]s preues him present ther God has hoght for to do. two other causes assignes A clerk that William Cassiodre hight, whi this tyme we done this werk of fastyng, prayng God almight. one is for Crist vp-steyng bade vs pray &amp; haue our wille, Petite &amp; accipietis. holy chirche wel affy[y]ng schulde this tyme his biddyng fulfille, That Crist [m]ight when he comen wer in heuen to his fader se, graunt vs fulle our praier in alle thing, as wilnet we. The second cause, sais William her, that we fast[e]n &amp; praien for, is to a-brige in this maner our flesshe this tyme al-way the mor And fliyng wenges vs to wynne by deuowte horesoun, for oresoun wenge is, as I myn, wher-whit to heuen fle we movne. So ?if our flesshe [abriget] be, and we haue wenges for to flye, the lightloker to heuen lee after Crist now we mowne hye. for a fole, we movne wel se, that to fatte of flesshe is he[re], schal not wel flye, no mor schun we witouten fasting &amp; prayer. The thridde nome this letany has hit is callet processioun, for holy chirche this mynde mas generali in vche tovne. for in hit a crois born is, belles also rungen bien, Baneres also shewde i-wis, and A dragon in sum place sene, whit a long taile communely, and to alle saintes we conen pray; now what alle these moun signifie er I cesse I wille ?ow say. the croice al-way is born befor and belles rungun eke also, for feer deueles moun no more thenne sight and hering of these two. ffor as a keng in his bataile as signes shewde ryally, trompes and baners may not faile, no mor may Crist want gostly In holy chirche bering of croice in stidde of his ryale baner, ny belles for to make noice, to fer the deueles that byn ner. For as a tiraunt wold haue drede to se a king of grete power in his londe bataile to bede, trumpyng &amp; raising baner, So dreden the deueles in the ayr to se the crois and belles to her, for thenne hor power most appair, and herd is fully hour praier. And for this cause as in sum place ?if any dredeful tempest falle, to fer deueles in that caas thai woln ring hor belles alle; And that prophetes double-fold, for deueles hit feres fast awaye that to raise tempestes byn to bold and fer men whit suche affray, and that ringing [mas] ?ong &amp; old alle the pepel for to pray, so that ringing, as I told, in double maner profet may. also the croice is A banere to heuen keng, as I sal say, for deueles dreden it to cum ner and sight of hit in gode fay. Iohan whit the gulden mouthe sais this, wher-seuer deueles this signe se may, thai fleen as fro a staf i-wisse whit whiche befor beten wer thai. Iohannes Crisostomus: Vbicumque demones signum dominicum uiderint, fugiunt tymentes baculum, quo plagam acceperunt. therfore in churches mony one, when laite or any tempest ys, thai taken oute the crois anone a?ayn the weder that fares omys, That deueles cause of that tempest Goddes signe when thai mone se, er mon or best ther-by be lest moun be ferd and made to fle. borne hit is in processioun also for to represent Cristes Ressurrectioun and eke assensioun verrament. for when he rose the thridde day then did he A grete victory, and a croice be-token may Victor, as lornet haue I. what victore might more be thenne the deuele wen he orecome, and out of helle wit grete pouste Adam and his ofspring noom? Also a baner forthe spreding that apon the crois is borne, betokenes mo[nn]es kinde ledyng to hauen blisse that wer forlorne. for as folk folowes processioun and that baner born before, so at Cristes ascensioun folk folowed hym ful muche mor. also song may signifie, that in processioun songun is, aungels song, when crist con hye vp-on hegh to heuen blisse. For Aungels metten hym in the waye and songen til he was in his se, therfor in processioun Aye to represent that syng[e]n we. in summe chirches eke also, and namely in the lond of Fraunce, to ber A dragon vset is tho deueles therby to haue penaunce, A long taile he schal haue hengyng ful of chaf or suche mater, two dayes the chaf ther inne lenging, the thridde daye empte boute wer. but tho thowe dayes that hit ful is befor the croice born hit schal be, the thridde day behind i-wis, what this betokenes ?e schun se. For er Moyses lawe was made and whil that law was enduryng, the deuel regnet and power hade of all men vrthe wonyng, But the thridde tyme of grace when Crist tholet his passioun, the dragons tail made empty was and he remewet from his renoun. Also sayntes we conen pray, in this processioun as we gone, what is the cause I schal [?]ow say, for thre thinges and that anone. For nede we han the furst is that other for holy saintes honour, the thridde for reuerence i-wis of God and Crist hour creatoure. For saintes moun haue grace to knowe our wil to hom and our praier, and thing that ioy to hom schal schewe and to vs help in that maner; Therfor the furst cause may be for our nede and grete any, that deseruen as not schuld we Of our misdede to haue mercy. therfor hit nedes vs to pray hom forto helpe vs in grete nede, ther-as our meryt help ne may heuen for to klayme for our gode dede. the secounde cause is whiterly, why we to saintes conen praye, to honer hom deuoutely and schowe thai bien wurthe aye to haue grauntet hor praiere, for Goddes wille is hit be so, for holy lyf thaye leuet her, hor bone schal euer be herd and oo. And for God wol thai honuret be for hor praieres that he wol graunte, therfore God wol that alle waye we to pray to hom bien enclinawnt. The thridde cause is resonable, that is for Goddes reuerence, Sayn that we felen vs vnable for to pray in his presence, Sayn we bien faynt and no thing stable and nyet him hauen whit grete offense, our owne praier is repreuable that so misrulen our conscience. Therfor gode mediacioun most be made whit mene waye of sainte? that wele pray movne, syn we vnwurthy bien to praye. In gowynge with this letany one song is godely for to vse aye, that ther is wreten oponly, and cause why I schal [?]ow say. Sancte Deus, Sancte, fortis, sancte &amp; inmortalis miserere nobis. Iohannes Damascenus. Iohan Damascen telles this in the feurthe boke that he mas, that at Constantyne Amys, A tribulacioun ther was, For whiche songen letany that God sech soro schul sesse, so fel a wonder sodeynly, that was sothe &amp; no thinge lesse. For a ?ong child raueschet was vp in-to heuen imong hom alle that maden processioun in that place, but none wist how that might befalle. For this song ther he was taght, and to the peple turnet A?ayn, and sang that he hade in heuen caght, Of whiche the peple wer ful fayn. for alle hor tribulacioun cesset at his suete singyng, as at a conuocacioun Was preuet trwe and no lesing, at A grete sene befor the pope at Calcedoyne, as reden we, wherthurgh that redes this may hope That this wonder trewe be. therfor we syngen this ilk, sonmg that fyndes moun be putte awaye, and none of hom be vs Imong, Syn any whit hit [be] wrthe to pray. now for to praise this thing oright, that hit is of auctorite, faur causes I find to-geder clight that hit is worthi praiset be, And is for the aungel taght hit, and meschef cesset at that singing, the [pope] als preuet hit be gode wit, and deueles dredden hit hering. De ascensione domini. Ihesu Cristes ascensioun euen the fourty day [was] done after his Resurrectioun, and how I schal declar [?]owe sone: Circa Christi ascensionem septem sunt consideranda, Primo, vnde ascendit, Secundo, quare non statim post resurrectionem ascendit, Set tot dies expectauit, Tercio qualiter ascendit, quarto cum quibus ascendit, Quinto quo ascendit, sexto quare ascendit. Primo vnde ascendit. Seuen causes bien for to hede Cristes ascensioun touching, as I wol reken and her rede in Latyn, ?if ?e hauen likyng. as to the furst I ?ow behe[t]e, God stegh from erthe to heuen in hye from the mounte of Oliuete on that side that is Betany, The whiche mounten callet was mounte of th[r]e lighte? skilfully, and whi that mounte that nome has I schal declar apertely. For in night toward the west fuyr in the temple made hit light, that brend of the best and most communely be night; and in the morn toward the est the sunne-bemes wer ful bright, and ?iuen light to most and lest er the cite hauedet any sight; Also that hulle hade grete plente of oyl that norisshes light be kynd, so mounte hit is of lightes thre, bi these skilles as I fynde. and to this hulle i-wis God bade his disciples go that selue day that he did this and went [to] weele from wordle woo. that day of his ascensioun twies I finde apperet he to his disciples praing boun, elleuen that wer in one meyne; as thay eten in a place the whiche thai wer wonet to, that day at home twye he was to teche hom what thai schuld do. for the aposteles euer-ichone and his trwe disciples also and wemen that leueten him opon about that place wer duelling tho, that is to wete in mounte Syon ther keng Dauid hade his palays, and ther a soupyng-place was one ther God mande as boke mynde mas: Erat Cenaculum grande Stratum in quo Dominus precepit pascha parari. and in that ilk, large halle that God made in his maunde, woneden the apostels alle alle that tyme, as reden we, Other disciples and wymmen in diuerse vones alle aboute, for sadde beleue hade neuer one then but alle this while wer in grete doute. thenne as thai eten in that halle, Crist to hom conne appar and repreuet ther hom alle of fainte bileue, as ?e moun ler by Markes gospel that he mas and vche redis as this daye, for [til] the Holi Gost sent was, imperfite wer alle thai. thenne when Crist whit hom ete he bade hom thai schuld tak the way to the mounte of Oliuete, ther eft he shewde him, soth to say. and ther to summe onsuaret he that frayneden indiscretely, thing that ?e moun sothle see in that gospel that er saide I: Recumbentibus &amp;c. Domine si in tempore hoc restitues &amp;c. Non est vestrum nosse &amp;c. thenne hef he huppe his honnde? two and blesset hom all whit mild steuen, and befor hom alle tho Stegh vppe in-to the blisse of heuen. &amp; in the place that he in stode, A glose sais in the euangely A chirche was made of werk ful gode that ?ette is sene apertely. but sithen that tyme might neuer mon make a pament in that place that Ihesu Crist stode opon when he to heuen stegh thurgh his grace, But ay sithen has bien sene in the hard marbul stone, right as a mon in sond had bene or ellus opon s[now]e han gone. Circa secundum, quare scilicet statim, vt resurrexit, non ascendit, sed per quadraginta dies expectare voluit. as to the secounde poynt go we, and telle whi he went not to blis anone after the dayes thre when he was risen, nowe knowe we this; But after that risen from deth was he, fourty he abode i-wys, thre skilles [nowe] ?e schun se that he did wel and not Amys. Primo propter resurrectionis certificacionem. the furst was for to certifie his werray resurrectioun, that he was risen bodely the selue that suffert passioun, and in his dede no fantasy to blinde men whit a?ayn resoun. he ete and dranke oft openly [&amp; to schow his body ofte was boun.] for ?if that fantasy hade bien in his dede be any way, mon schuld nother haue feld ne sene flesshe ne blode ne schewet aye: Quia spiritus carnem &amp; ossa non habet. Als hit was mor difficulte to preue his resurrectioun, by werray whit ?e mone wel se, thenne for to preue his passioun, ffor passioun in dayes thre might wel be preuet by resoun, but mo dayes be[l]euet be bytwene tha[t] and the ascensioun. Therfor Leo the Pope preching thonkes Crist in his sermoun off his nedeful tarying that tyme for our saluacioun, âfor wel better,â he sais, âhit was that hese disciples haden drede of his rising in that caas, thenne we after for mor drede.â Leo papam, Sermone de ascensione: Gratias Agimus diuine dispensacioni &amp; sanctorum patrum necessarie tarditati. Dubitatum est ab illis, ne dubitaretur A nobis. The secounde cause whi he abode was for to comfort his meisne and make hit knowen to hom Abrode that risen verraily was he. for thagh God wil men to hym der sum time haue tribulacioun, ?et bout comfort in no maner he may not leue hom by resoun, And wel thai wist that dede was he but of his risyng Ã¾ai wer in drede, therfore oft time hym to se to comfort hom hit was gret nede. the thrid cause ful thester is, but ?et as negh as I con declare I wil hit now I-wys, sum sauour ?ou to haue Ã¾er-on. ffor we shuld haue vnderstondyng that Goddes comfort in gret nede passes fer his chastisyng And tribulacioun, as I rede, therfore his comfort is liknet her As an hour is to a day, And as a day is to a ?er, And in quat maner I shal say. ffor ?if Ã¾at Goddes derlyng der, And qvo-so serues hym any way, suffer wo in any maner for ri?twysnes o[r] for gode fay, the ioy that he shal haue Ã¾erfore shal pas Ã¾e pyne hym forto pay, for his godnes so mich more As a ?er is bi a day, or as a day is by an hour, that sich as rulen wel hor witt moun knowe hor mede for that langour fourty-folde forto be qvytt. therfore Ã¾e prophet Isaye sais he wold preche one likyng ?er A?aynus one day of anye to God that ?eldes in that maner. Isaie xvi: Predicarem annum placabilem domino, diem vlcionis Deo nostro. her apertly ?e moun se one day of tribulacioun Askes one ?er whit to be of comfort &amp; remissioun. so to conclude our first mater And sett an hour to a day, ffourty houres bout wer Ihesus in his sepulcre lay, And fourtie daies on erth he went After his resurreccioun, to comfort his brether he toke entent In hor gret tribulacioun. Vnde glossa: Quadraginta horis mortuus fuerat, propter hoc quadraginta diebus se viuere confirmabat. Ensavmple by this we moun se, that suffres for Ã¾e ri?t any ffourty-fold qvit he shal be And rewardet, as ere saide I. Circa tercium qualiter Ascendit. The thrid poynt is god to knowe how he stegh to heuen blis, first my?tily, as I shal showe, As Isaie wel witnes Ã¾is: Quis est iste, qui venit de Edom &amp;c; gradiens in multitudine fortitudinis. Primo potenter Isaie lxvj. Also sayn Ion sais Ã¾at neuer none stegh into heuen saue only he that Goddes sone is &amp; verray mon, And now sittyng in that se. then sais Ã¾e glose made Ã¾er-opon that neuer none thur?e his owen powste, for no creatur Ã¾at con, hit wer impossibilite. And al-thagh Crist in cloude vp went not thur?e the cloudes owen power, but schowe hit was obedient to serue Crist in that maner; For vche creatur is kent be kind to serue his creatour, ther-for that cloude was ther present to do his office at that our. So he stegh vp whit ful pouste of his godhede, none other waye, for none Aungels help hade he ny other element, soth to say, As hade Enok and Hely that raueschet wer thurgh Godes might, that one in fuyr, as sais the story, that other in cloude whit Angels bright. Vnde dicit Gregorius: Primus per coitum generatus &amp; generans Scilicet Enoc, Secundus generatus set non generans scilicet Helias, Tercius nec generatus nec generans scilicet Christus, qui propria virtute ascendit. Secundo Ascendit patenter. Also he stegh vp openly in alle his disciples sy?t, and neuer one asket qweder ne why, for thai knewe he was God almight. Iohannes xvi: Nemo ex vobis interrogat me, quo vadis. And steghe vp in hor sight wold he for thre causes that I sal say, one is that thai schuld witnesses be of that [thai] seghen another daye. the secounde cause that thai suld se hor owen kind broght vp that day and mirthe in hert haue, leue ?e me, to be mor stidfast in the fay, and for that kindnes so kud alle way wilne his trace to suwe, and thoght on hym in hert hud in tribulacioun to be trewe. Tercio ascendit letantur quia iubilantibus Angelis. Also he stegh vp ioyfully, for aungels in heuen light maden mirthe and melody when thai seghen that ilk sight. Psalmus: Ascendit deus in [iu]b[i]lacione[m]. And Austyn sais when Crist vp steghe alle heuen schuld haue for that grete drede, âSterres merueile steking on hegh, alle sainte? enioy for that dede, âTrompes ?iuen a blisful soun, and that glade wer suetely sing, in that wher of deuocioun, full off ioy alle likyng.â Quarto velociter, quoniam tantum spacium in momento percurrit. Also Crist stegh hastely in one stounde so fer to go, as Dauid in his prophecy told before hit suld be so: Exultauit vt gigas ad currendam &amp;c. But how fer he lepe ?e schun se, as the philosopher sais her, Raby Moyses, leue ?e me, that writes of hit in this maner. he sais, âseuen heuenes ther bien, and seuen planetes eke also, and vche planete a heuen betwene as muche space as a mon wil go âof playne way in fiue hundret ?er, and space betwene vchone of tho as muche as vche heuen that is cler, of one widenes byn both two, âSo that the space that betwene is from heuen to heuen, as sais he, of as grete widenes i-wis as is vche heuen of quantite. âthen seuen heuens to acompt and seuen spaces hom betwene to seuen thousand h[it wol] Amovnt, ?if thai trwle meten bene. âand for to reken wol oright from middes of the vrthe her to the heghchip and light of the seuent boute wer, âthe whiche Saturnes callet is, seuen thousand hunderth and seuen space, as muche as mon schulde go i-wis in so long while and he hade grace. âand to acompt vche iovrne to fourty mile of heuen way, as vche mile, as leue ?e me, two thousand [cubitus] leue ?e me, âAnd putte also to vche ?er thre hundreth dayes &amp; sixte,â thus haue I acomptet her how hegh Crist lepe thurgh his merce.

Psalmus: Ascendisti in altum, cepisti Captiuitatem. and that he stegh vp eke Also whit grete novmbre of Aungels cler and holy men as both two, this prophecy wil witnes her: Ysais xviij?: Quis est iste, qui venit de Eodom, &amp;c. for when Crist to heuen went, summe Aungels in heuen wer that wer not in hor kind kent that God hade mon for-boght so der, Ne that he mon becomen was, therfor thai wonderet on that sight of suche prese comyng to that place, And Crist al blody and so dight. then the lasse aungels asket the mor, who that was that come heuen whitinne from the world ledyng thore suche as helle haden bien whit-inne, Quis est iste, qui venit de Eodom &amp; eodom interpretatur sanguinia, Bosra munita, quasi diceret: Quis est iste, qui venit de mundo saguinio per peccatum &amp; de inferno Munito, &amp;c &amp;c. but Denys in a boke he mas sais when Crist to heuen went thre questiouns in that caas Aungels askeden Crist present. the furst that grete Angels made vchone to other alle in ffer, the secounde to Crist thai hade in this maner that ?e schun her, the thrid questioun i-wis the lasse maden to the mor, as I schal declar ?ow this, but sumqwat I haue sade befor. thenne askeden the grete ther-in who was he that come ther so out of the blody world of synne and from helle so stoutely tho. Iste formosus in stola sua, &amp;c. âSemely he is in his clethyng, and goyng with a ful power,â and while thay weren thus spekyng Ihesus vnswaret, as ?e schun her.

Euer til the day of dome schal be and therto shewe hom openly. the furst cause now ?e schun se, as at sayn Bede lornet haue I, for to norisshe fully [Ã¾e] fay of his resurectioun, that he rose the thridde day next after his passioun in that flesshe and blode verray that deghet for our saluacioun, lest men hade opet him sto[l]en away by coyntys and collusioun, And that sum other body rose that was made be fantasy, as was emonge Iewes lose hor error for to iustifye. the secounde cause, for to present the blody stremes as this day to his fader omnipotent, and for all mon-kinde to pray. the thridde, that gode schulde knowe how merciable thai were by hym for-boght, hit wold showe, to mynne him on that maner. the feurthe cause, to knowe be tho he hade euer-lesting victory of the deuel that did vs wo and broght vs in so grete any. that fift cause is at wikket men schal knowe that thai movne worthely for hor misdede be dampnet thenne, that to Crist deden vnkindely, for his kindenes schal showe wel ther that he kuythet to mon-kinde by blody on body that he schal ber, men of hor misdede to haue mynde. Thenne to this questioun anon Crist onsuaret and saide this, âthat pressour I haue appairet al-one, ?ette of the folk, whit me none is.â Torcular calcaui solus &amp; de gentibus non est vir mecum. The holy croice may callet be a pressour pressing blode so bright, in whiche pressour presset was he that dehet on rode for monnes right. Or elles the deuel he calles her Suche a ppressour properly, that mon-kinde bindes that maner in sinne and sorow sotily, that gostly and to God der He presses oute ful priuely, and leues in him noght that gode wer, vices by lengyng hym destrye. But our fegher put vnder fote that ilk pressor vs appairing, breke bond of synne &amp; did vs bote, and stegh to heuen as heghest king, the tauerne of heuen oponet he and sent wyne of the Holy Gost, and whit that wine sustenet wer we to striue agayn the deueles bost. The thridde questioun that was made when that Crist to heuen stegh, lasse aungels to the mor hade in his goyng vppe on hegh: Quis est iste rex glorie? Respondit dominus virtutum ipse est Rex glorie. âWhat is he this kinge of blisse?â Saiden the lasse to the more, then thai onsuareden and saiden this, that vertuouse God went ther befor, Keng of blisse that mon is, as Dauid propheciet hor, nowe is fulfillet forsothe i-wis his prophecy in Angels lore. Of these Aungels questioun when that Crist to heuen went, and of that onsuar be resoun, Austyn tretes whit gode entent, And sais that alle the air on hegh at Cristes vpsteing halowet was, and novmbre of deueles when he vppe stegh floghen for ferde to se his face, To the whech runnen fast Aungels at hom forto enquer, what power that was that by hom past and what keng of blis went so ther.

Then thai onsuaret &amp; als tite and saiden âsikerly this is he that was so rody &amp; so white, and after-ward mo rud hade he, âSo bitterli that bale con bete, he suffert on the rode tre, big agayn the deuel to flite and armet no way for to fle, âIn dethe foul semyng to the sight, wonder fair in hup-rising, white of that virgyn he in light, all reide of blode in croice hengyng, âA purs to geder repreues inne ffor mony repreue then hade he, but in heuen shynyng bout syn clerly now we moun hym se.â Circa quintum, quo scilicet Ascendit. Now shul we wit quider he went, A-buf alle heuens, leue ?e me, for from that plas to erth he glent, And thider a?ayn Ã¾is day stegh he. Alle thing as was his entent to fulfille with hert fre, As Ã¾e apostle her present witnes, as wel reden we: Ad Ephesios iiij?: Qui descendit, ipse est, &amp; qui Ascendit super omnes celos vt adimpleret omnia. âA-buf alle heuens,â sais he her, for mony heuens I fynde Ã¾er bene, Abuf alle quich with-out wer he stegh Ã¾is day, as we shal sene. Est enim celum materiale, rationale, intellectuale &amp; [super] substantiale. ffour maner heuens wel I fynde As clercus speken of conyngly, the quych, qvil it is in my mynde, declar I wil as lernet haue I. The first is heuen made of mater &amp; seuen of Ã¾o Ã¾er ben I-wys, As I bifore tolde ?ou her, but hor names her writen is In Latyn, wel as ?e moun se, but Ã¾e Englisch I wil leeue, lest men presumptuose holden me to put me firre Ã¾en I may preue. Nota quod vii sunt celi, scilicet celum aereum, ethereum, Olimpium, igneum, siderium, cristalinum &amp; empirium &amp; celum sancte trinitatis supra omnes. Another heuen in world is her that resonablie callide is, A ri?t-wis mon &amp; to God der that dos al wel &amp; no?t amys, by thre skilles preue I may that sich a mon of gode lyuyng In heuen blis is dwellyng ay, And heuenly weel in hym wonyng. ffor as heuen is Goddes se And wonyng, as sais Isaie, so ri?twis monnus saule may be A see of wisdome witerly: Isaie xxx?: Celum mihi sedes est. &amp; in Sapientia: Anima iusti sedes est sapientie. Als a monnus soule in this may callide be heuen by resoun, that holi &amp; gode alway is In his conuersacioun, ffor he thenkes neuer amys, but ay toward that blis is boun, And holdes this world no?t worth I-wis so grete is his deuocioun, Vnde dicit apostolus: Nostra conuersacio in celis est. therfore sais Ã¾e apostle her by hym-self &amp; oÃ¾er mo, that in Ã¾is world tho?ten nothin[g] der but alway towarde heuen to go, âOur lyuyng is in heuen cler,â And sothly he my?t say then so, for til Ã¾ai alle martiride wer The soule in heuen, Ã¾e body in wo. the thrid cause qverfore &amp; qvy that monnus saule of gode lyuyng Is callide heuen worthily, ffor continuel gode worchyng. ffor right as heuen meues all way, So meuen sainte? hor soules her toward the blisse that lastes ay whit continuel pray[er], And meuen the deuel als day for day, when he wold [no]ye, [no]ght to cum ner, that the soule, I may wel say, his werrai heuen whil hit is kler. Item celum intellectuale est Angelus. Angeli enim dicuntur celum, quia ad instar celi sunt sanctissimi, vt patet inferius. Heuen of gode vnderstondyng Arn aungels in heuen bright, that alway bien in hegh duelling, as heuen his cler and alway bright, By-cause of hor grete dignite And excellence thai han ther, of whiche spekes, as ?e schun se, A grete clerk Denys hom to her, Dionisius in libro de diuine nominibus capitulo iiij?: Diuine mentes sunt super reliqua existencia &amp; viuunt super reliqua viuencia &amp; intelligunt &amp; cognoscunt super sensum &amp; racionem &amp; plus quam omnia existencia pulcrum &amp; bonum desiderant &amp; eo perticipant. And calles Aungels that bien cler Goddes myndes that inne him is, for what he thenkes whitouten wer by hom is wroght anone in blisse; for thai bien ministres of his wille, therfor his myndes I may hom calle, frely anone for to fulfille in his thoght what-seuer may falle. Therfor he sais her that thai bene aboue all thing that is, and aboue all that leue may thai leuen in liking, leue wel this, Vnderstonden and knowen ay aboue alle resoun and wit i-wisse, and mor then any thing may that made is thai mone no way mys, That is fair and gode also thai wilnen all way witerly, and han part of hit for oo boute whit-stondyng, trauail or ny. Secundo: sunt pulcherime nature &amp; glorie, de quorum pulcritudine dicit Dionisius in eodem libro: Angelus est manifestacio occulti luminis, speculum purum, clarissimum, inco[n]taminatum, in-coinquinatum, suscipiens, si est fas dicere, pulcritudinem boniformis Deiformitatis. Also Aungels in hor kinde arn most fair in heuen blis, of whiche fairnes, as I finde, spekes this clerk no thing amys, and sais, âan aungel is ovt-showing of hidde light and clene merour, Most clene and fylet no thing, all graciouse thing as gouernour, âAnd ?if hit leueful be to say, an Aungel cler wel I may calle of Goddes fourmyng in gode fay and most like thing to him of alle.â Also aungels biggest bien by-cause of wertu and power, of whiche spekes, as wel i-sene, A clerk, Iohan Damasce, wisele her, Damascenus libro ij? capitulo iij?: ffortes sunt angeli et parati ad Dei voluntatis expletionem &amp; ibi confestim inueniuntur, vbi diuinus iusserit nutus. And sais that stif aungeles on hegh be redy all-way to fulfill Goddes will &amp; therto slegh, &amp; ther byn fonden loud and still, As God biddus all-way negh gode to spare &amp; ewle to spill, be thi trauel neuer so dregh strenght thai han all-way at will. Quarto celum sup[er]substanciale est equalitas diuine excellentie. the furth heuen I spek of her is aboue all substancial thing, ther is the Trinite entere Fadur &amp; Son &amp; Gost wonnyng; from wheche heuen, withouten were, com Crist &amp; thider went, bout lesing, herto acordes the Sauter that Dauid mad God ay plesing: Psalmus: A summo celo egressio eius. therfore aboue thes heuens all to that hegh place then vp stegh he, which heuen of all is hede &amp; wall, ther is the verrai trinite, A-bowe all heuens materiall as shawes this Psalme, as ?e shin se, told before what shuld befall by king Dauid, as then wrot he: Eleuata est magnificentia tua &amp;c he said that Goddes gretnesse was abowe all heuens howen on hegh, that is to wit to that place ther soueraigne wisdam is &amp; slegh. Empirium that heuen cald is, aboue then whiche mon-kind he [b]roght to the most soueraigne blisse that for his godhid is wroght. For that flesch &amp; blod entere that he toke of Mare fre, thider he broght withouten were to his fader heghust see. ?e shul not leue he houen was as was Ennoc &amp; Heli here, nother to that selwe place ny only thurgh aungeles power; ffor thai were broght to Paradise that Adam lost for his trespace, but Ihesu thurgh his awen awice went thidur as is the heghust place. In that heuen Crist is wonnyng &amp; with him aungeles clene &amp; clere, and holy saintes of gode liuing whil that thai in erthe were, So heghe ?et ther comes non as is the holy Trinite, for his see is abowe uchone &amp; in him our kind has he. But if hit be our lady alon that ho knewe more then we mon se, vnworthi is all thing to that won &amp; knowe so fer his priuetee. Quod ascendit super celos rationales. now that he stegh vp eke also aboue all heuens resonable, that is to wit men out of wo &amp; saintes to blisse alway able, As I declaret here bifore, hit shewes by this autorite aboue all saules lasse &amp; more &amp; eke the heghust heuen ?ede he. Canticorum ij?: Ecce iste venit saliens in montibus &amp; transiliens colles. âseâ, sais the wise mon, âas he went lepyng in hilles &amp; ore-lepyng the coppes of homâ, then is vs kent by glose of this to haue conyng, What thes hilles moun signifie &amp; coppes of hom, I wol ?ow mynne. here calles the glose, I shal not lighe, tho hilles aungeles he lepe inne, For aungeles all about him were when he so to heuen went, therfore he calles hom hilles here that so with him that tyme wer lent. &amp; hilles coppes that he ore-lepe where holi saintes he with him toke, but ?et aboue hom, takes kepe, he lepe, ?et he hom no?t forsoke. So that I may preue by this aboue all heuens stegh that king that resonable arn callet iwis, &amp; heuens of gode vnderstonding, the whiche byn aungeles clene &amp; clere for excellentship &amp; dignite, as I before declaret here preue I wol by autorite: Psalmus: Qui ponis nubem ascensum tuum, qui ambulas super pennas ventorum. also to preue that he up-stegh to the heghust heuen of all, the gospel here is writen negh to wittenesse what-seuer may bifall: Marci vltimo: Et dominus quidem Ihesus postquam locutus est eis, assumptus est in celum &amp; sedet a dextris Dei. Marc sais, âwhen oure lort Ihesu had spoken with his discipuls here, he s[t]e[gh] thurgh his vertue &amp; sat on Goddes right hond nere.â Goddes right hond callet is the euenship of Goddes myght, ffor euen &amp; euen thai were iwis when he was commen into that light. Circa sextum quare ascendit notandum. now whi he stegh vp into that blisse, gode is to knowe with hert stable, neghen causes I fynd iwis That frutfull arn &amp; profitable. Nota quod ascensionis domini ix sunt fructus siue vtilitates. The first frut of all is this, to won with God hit mad vs able &amp; to loue him treuely in this, he to vs more merciable. For Crist said er he vp went, âbot if I go, ?e moun not knowe ?our consailour that shal be sent, the Holi Gost to comfort ?ow.â Iohannis xvi?: Nisi ego abiero, paraclitus non veniet ad vos. Then tretes Austain opon this &amp; sais, âif that we fleschely drow to God, in that we done amys, noght gode discipuls by his sawe, âBut ?if [we] gostly wilne his grace and desiren hit for to winne, we mouen be able to that place that he stegh to and now is in.â Augustinus: si carnaliter mihi adheseritis, capaces spiritus non eritis. the secounde prophete witerly ys forto haue the mor knowing of his godhede, as preues herby that sayn Iohn sais vs showing, Iohannis xiiij?: si diligeretis me, gaudiretis vtique, quia vado ad patrem. âyff ?e louet me tenderly, ?e schuld haue tho mor likyng That I go to my fader in hye, that in heuen is heghest keng.â thenne says Austyn glosing this in Goddes nome, as ?e schun her, in Latyn furst as wreten ys, and aftre in Englis mor cler: Augustinus: Ideo subtraho formam istam serui, in quo pater maior me est, vt Deum spiritum aliter videatur. be-cause that is apostels alle Seghen him her as werray mon and do as to a mon schuld falle, Saue synne might none put hym opon, and als he told oft befor that werray Goddes son was he, therfor to dwelle as mon euermor whit hom by skil hit might not be. ny in-as-meche as he God was to duelle in erthe hit semet ewel, therfor to his proper place He most go to ouercome the deuel. and whil he was in erthe her seruant he was from heuen sent, From his fader of fulle power to forbye mon obedient, therfor to preue that he God was as wele as mon, him nedet to go bothe God and mon in-to that place that he befor for mon come fro, And fourme of seruand put awaye steghyng in-to heuen blisse, that his discipuls mighten say, âwerray God our maistre isâ. Therfor saynt Austyn by his witte in Cristes nome sais sothele this, âfourme [of seruant] away I putte that ?e moun knowe me God i-wis.â Hec Augustinus vbi prius. Tercia vtilitas sue ascensionis est meritum fidei. the thridde prophete in gode fay of Ihesu Crist ascensione is merit that mon wene may To leue whit ful deuocion that was done that ilk day when he to heuen made him bouon, and for to leue with hert werray that no flesshely men se moun. Leo papa In sermone de ascensione: Magnarum enim hic vigor est mencium incuntanter credere, que corporio non videntur in-tuitu, &amp; ibi figere desiderium, quo nequeas inferre conspectum. Saint Austyn tretes of this mater opon a uerse that I sal say, that Dauid writes in his Sauter, whiche werse begynnyng rede ?e may, Exultauit vt gigas, &amp; cetera; and sais that Crist tarit noght to help vs whil that he was her, but ran crying and vche way soght to bring vs oute of grete daunger, Whit word and penible preching, holy lif whit-outen synne, suffring dethe, to helle goyng to bring vs owte that wer Ã¾er-in, Leuyng a?ayne, &amp; hym showing to his brether er he wold twinne, and after-ward to heuen steghynge, that selue wele vs for to wynne. He ran crying that sinful men schuld turne to him and sun forsake, from hegh-sight he went then that we schuld turne &amp; herte wake, in gode lif for to fynde him ther as he went in heuen blis, [and] this prophet wel vs to ber, we movne be sekur of i-wis. Hec Augustinus. Quarta est nostra securitas. The furth profit in gode fay That he stegh for to heuen blisse, to mak vs siker soth to say &amp; preue vs for his ther he is, And our aduocate to be in nede to his fadur all-welding, that whil thar vs haue no drede to com ther-as he is wonyng. Herto acordes gode saint Iohn &amp; sais, âa gode vocate han we to the fader of heuen vp-gon, Ihesu Crist that deghet on tre.â Iohannis ij?: Aduocatum habemus apud patrem Ihesum Christum iustum &amp; ipse est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris. of whiche sicurnesse said before that mon schuld haue on heuen blisse, Bernard in his liking lore ful wittely declares this, Right as sinful men shuld say that where represent priuely, so spekes Bernard, in gode fay, to preue gode to that blisse worthy, Bernardus: Securum accessum habes, o homo, ad Deum vbi mater ante filium, filius ante patrem, mater ostendit filio pectus &amp; vbera, filius ostendit patri latus &amp; vulnera: Nulla ergo poterit esse repulsa, vbi tot concurrunt caritatis insignia. And sais, âmon, thow has sicur way to go to God graciousely, theras is redy for to pray bothe moder and sone ful of mercy; âThenne moder to the son in blisse, the son to the fadur on hegh, I con wit no way i-wis how help might schap him more negh. âFor the moder showes the son brest and pappes that soek he, whenne son is mynnet opon that wone on monkind he most haue pite, âAnd shewes the fader side &amp; woundes that he tholet on rode tre, thus bothe biholden the blisset bounde? of werray loue and charite. âTher may be none a?ayn-puttyng when all these seignes shewet byn, ny for to help mon ma[ke] fluttyng, God may not schutte him, wel is sene.â Quinta vtilitas est nostra dignitas the fift prophet preue I may mon-kinde hade whenne Crist vp-stegh, that our kind that ilk day to heghest heuen was houen on hegh, And on Goddes right honde sette to preue vs next his deite, for godhede whit mon-hede was met to menske monkind, leue ?e me. Therfor aungels clene and cler euer sithen that tyme mighten wel se that mon to God was more der thenne Aungels wer of dignite, And forbeden hom to honour Syn mon was broght vp to that blisse, to preue in myn word non errour saynt [Iohn] the apostel witnesses this; for in the Apocalipse I rede that when the aungel spake to Iohan, Iohan honuret him in word &amp; dede and felle bifore his fete anone, Thenne the aungel sain Iohn bede noght to do so, that tyme was gone, for his seruaunt he was in nede and his bretheres euer-ichone, For sithen Crist his blode con schede and made God and mon all one, muche more honuret, to take hede, ys mon thenne Aungel in that wone. Apocalipsis xix: Cecidi, inquit, ante pedes eius, vt adorarem eum, &amp; dixit mihi: Vide ne feceris, conseruus tuus sum &amp; fratrum tuorum habencium testimonium Ihesu. Then sais the glose made opon this that in the old law werrayment Aungel wernet no mon i-wis to honur so from heuen sent, but after Crist stegh in-to blisse And monnes kinde to heuen was hent, he thoght his dignite more then his and wayue[t] that worschip wer he went. Sexta est spei nostre soliditas. the sixt profit sikerly ys studfast hope Ã¾at we mone haue to cum after him astily, that stegh to heuen mon-kinde to saue. therfor the apostel her sais that a grete bischop haue we, Ihesu, Goddes son dere, that percet h[e]uen thurgh his pouste. haue we that hope, whitouten wer, and we schun perce hit as did he, ?if our lif be clene and cler, and whit him in that blis be: Ad Hebreos iiij?: Habentes ergo pentecosten magnum, qui penetrauit celos, Ihesum filium Dei teneamus spei nostre confessione, &amp;c. Septima est vie ostensio. the seuen p[rofe]te whi he ?ode to heuen blis now as this day, Mathy sais was for our nede to teche vs the redy way: Mathie secundo: Ascendit pandens iter ante. thenne beide Austyn witerly, âsithen Ihesu Crist our saueour has made our way thurgh his mercy, ryse and go &amp; bide non howr.â that is as muche for to say as bidde vs rise vp of our synne, then schun we finde euen way to wele, that he has for to wynne. Augustinus: Via tibi facta est ipse saluator &amp; ambula, noli pigressere. Octaua vtilitas est ianue celestis [a]per[i]cio. the Aghtet profit is opunnyng of heuen ?ates to vs alle that to gode lif hauen liking and comfort ay to Crist to [calle]. for right as Adam furst befor opunnet helle-?ates has to his ofspringe that greuet sor, so Crist the seconde tyme [h]as opunnet vp for euermor heuen-?ates thurgh his grace, whenne he stegh vp heuen thore whit monnes kinde into Ã¾at place. Vnde cantat ecclesia: Tu deuicto mortis, &amp;c. Nona vtilitas est preparacio gaudiorum loci. the nynt profit was, in gode fay, that he stegh forth in-to Ã¾at blisse for to ordaine vs that way Ther in wele to wone i-wis. Iohannis xiiij?: Vado parare vobis locum. Sayn Iohan the apostel to our pay In his gospel witnes this, that God saide he stegh vp this day to ordayne our place whit his. Then tretes Austyn on this maner speking to God deuoutely and saide, âpuruay at our praer that thow puruayes appertely.

That he fro the fader come Sayn witnes, as ?e schun se, and sais, âthe fader of rightwis dome will send his gost to his men-?e.â Iohannis xvi?: Cum Autem venerit ille spiritus veritatis, docebit omnem veritatem. then tretes a doctour opon this and sais, âthe holy trinite And godhede Ã¾at vnchangeable is, in substance non but one is he, âand in this werk forsoth i-wis may not be twynnet, leue ?e me, in wille, in might, &amp; eke in blisse, all bien one ther persones three. âthe trinite thurgh his mercy Deuyset this werk thurgh his might, mon-kind of bale for to bye, this as ?e schun se in sight; âthat the fader alweldyng Schuld suffre mercy to be wroght; The son shewde hit at his comyng, when that he on rode was broght; âAlso the Holy Gost in confermyng of that be-for so don and thoght Schuld make our hertes hote brennyng qven that bote to vs wer bro?t.â Hec Leo papa: Beate trinitatis incommutabilis Deitas vna est in substancia &amp; diuisa in comparacione corporis in voluntate par in potencia equalis in gloria. Diuisit sibi autem opus nostre redempcionis misericordia trinitatis, vt pater propiciaret, spiritus sanctus igniret. For the Holi Gost God is, ther I preue he hade gret mi?t to gif hym-self to vs I-wis, As wel as fader &amp; son by ri?t. Saynt Ambros preues wel Ã¾is, the Holi Gost may not by gri?t fulle god-hede, ellis wer mys by four skilles, in monnus si?t. Ambrosius in libro de spiritu sancto: Deus cognoscitur, aut quia sine peccato est, aut quia condonat, aut quia creatura non est, aut quia non adorat, sed adoratur. ffor God is knowen skilfully ouÃ¾er for he is bout syn, or for he forgifs thur?e his mercy synful men that ben Ã¾er-in, oÃ¾er ellis for he endeles is, ne creatur bot creatour, or for he honourede is And to non oÃ¾er dos honour. then in this worde spoken her is shewide hou Ã¾e trinite holly to vs &amp; most der ?eue hym-self, as ?e shyn se, ffor Ã¾e fader al Ã¾at he hade he ?eue vs, as sais saynt Austyne, his son, his gost sent vs to glade, As I reherce in Latyne: Misit nobis filium suum in pretium nostre redempcionis, spiritum sanctum in preuilegium nostre adopcionis &amp; se ipsum reseruauit in heriditatem adoptacionis. he says, âhe send his son adoun for preciouse price vs to for-bye; the Holi Gost for enchesoun Of our dessire, &amp; to distrye âThe deuel Ã¾at wyth bale was bowun to bynd vs into hys baylie; and hym-selfe hole, wete ye moun, ffor our heritage, as rede I.â Thus dede the fader to begynne; The son also, as I schal say, schewyde hym for to scleke oure synne, Als Bernarde says al to our paye; âffor vs to saue hys lif he lede, his blode he ?ef vs forto drynke, hys flesche for mete in fourme of brede, her was fayr gyfft, as men mon thynke.â Bernardus: Dedit nobis animam in precium, sanguinem suum in potum, carnem in cibum, &amp;c. Also Ã¾e Holy Gost i-wysse All that felle to hym ?eue hee Als Poule sais, nothyng amysse, Iche mon after his degre; ffor sommon he ?efe wysdom too, summon conyng, summon gude faye, and Ã¾e Holy Gost wold doo To schow hym to monkyn[d] verray. Ad Chorinthios xiiij?: Alii per spiritum sanctum datur sermo sapiencie, Alii sermo scientie, secundum eundem spiritum, Alteri fides, &amp;c. Secundo quot modis missus est. Now to the secund goo wee, and telle in how mony manere the Holy Gost, as ?e schun see, May send be, tokenes hit here. In too maners, leue ?e me, one is in sy?t of sum mater, As ?if in fir or cloude come he; Ã¾at oÃ¾er vsen men in hert cler quen he comes &amp; is not sene, Ã¾en slydes he in-to mennes mynde Ã¾at chast &amp; in clene lyfe bene, in oÃ¾er plas schall non hym fynde. Iohannis tercio: Spiritus, vbi vult, spirat &amp; vocem eius Audis, set nescis, a quo venit aut quo vadat, &amp;c. Ãerfor saynt Iohn says, âGoddes gost springes &amp; lenges quer hym lyst; his gost Ã¾ou heres bout bost, bot quethen hit comes, is vnwyst.â Ã¾en Bernarde says, âno meruayle is, ffor be Ã¾o eghen he entres noght, ffor colour has he none I-wis, quen he comes in monnes tho?t, âNe Eres faren nothyng amys be sownyng, quen he so is so?t, ne be Ã¾o nase, leue wele this, bot in holy hert Ã¾at wele is wro?t.â &amp; monnes Avne skylfull dome shall tell quen he comes in, ffor Bernarde says Ã¾at quen he come, vices flogh euer with-oute dyn, &amp; vertues entreden Anone; Ã¾en meruaylled he in Ã¾is maner, âhow vertues comen &amp; vices gon, wunderly by his wisdome wer!â ffor quen he amendet of his lyfe, he persayued Goddes my?t, Ã¾at wykked gost Ã¾at did hym stryfe was wayued in refourmyng ry?t, Ãen segh he Goddes swetnes ther, And tho wykket wos went oway, Ã¾en hertly alway he con hym heer, As I in Latyn thenke to say: Ex motu cordis intellexi presenciam eius, ex fuga vicorum Aduerti potenciam virtutis eius &amp; ex quacumque emendacione morum meorum expertus sum bonitatem mansuetudinis Et ex reformacione &amp; renouacione spiritus mentis mee prospexi, vt-cumque speciem decoris eius &amp; ex motu horum omnium expaui multitudinem magnifitudinis eius, &amp;c. Hec dicit Bernardus. quen Ã¾o Holy Gost has ben sent De emissione visebili. In any mater Ã¾at mon may see, be fyue maners, as I am kent, he has ben sent, as rede we. ffyrst in A dove lykenes, Primo in columbe specie. Crist quen Ã¾at he folwed was, As Saynt Luke beres wytnes &amp; in gospell mynde mas: Descendit spiritus sanctus corporali specie. Luce iij?. Tho secunde tyme in cloude bry?t Secundo in nube specie. At Cristes transfiguracioun, quen he to his men kuyt his my?t, In gospell As ?e rede moun. Ad-huc eo loquente ecce nubes lucida obumbrauit eos, &amp;c. Tho thrid tyme wos be a blast Ter io in inflacione. he sent tho Holy Gost to hyse, Ã¾at hor hertes shulden last, ffor in Ã¾at werke he made hom wise. &amp; quen he blwe he sayd this, âhaues her Ã¾o Holy Gost in ?ow, Ã¾at ?e for-?eiten not Ã¾is my faithe fully for to knaw.â Iohannis xx??: Inflauit &amp; dixit: Accipite spiritum sanctum, &amp;c. The furthe tyme in fir, in fay, Quarto in igne. The fyfte in tong &amp; strange speche, quinto in lingua. In Ã¾es too he come as Ã¾is day ffor to be our lyfes leche. Ãer-for shwed in syght was he In Ã¾es fyfe lykenes, as I say, Ã¾at vnderstonde fully shyn we hor propurtees, all to our pay, Of queche Ã¾at he schwed hym Ã¾en, to knaw Ã¾at he wurches al-way In mennes hertes, as I myn, with Ã¾os maters to mende hom ay, &amp; bryng mon owt of dedly syn, Also to do poyntes to his pay. Now at Ã¾o dowue I will begyn his kynde to moraluse, As I may. Tho verray kynde of dowue is this, in stede of song to be mournyng, In hyr wontes galle I-wis, In holes off ston is hyr wonnyng. Ry?t so Ã¾o Holy Gost in this mas men to sorowe for hor synnyng, &amp; quen Ã¾ai mendet haue Ã¾is mys, then has he way &amp; full entryng. Ã¾er her-to Acordes Issay, In Laten clerkes for to rede, &amp; says, âwe mournen as dowfe ay, &amp; as beeres romeonâ, as I rede. Issay libro iiij??: Rugiemus quasi vrsi &amp; quasi columbe meditantes gememus. Item Ad Romanos viij?: Ipse spiritus postulat pro nobis gemitibus inenarrabilibus, id est, nos postulantes gementes facit, &amp;c. The secund kynde Ã¾e dowfe has, ho has no bytternes of galle, ne bitternes none in Ã¾at plaas Ã¾er-as Ã¾o Holy Gost will fall. Sapiens dicit: O quam bonus &amp; suauis est, domine, spiritus tuus, &amp;c. Ãerfor Ã¾o wise mon wonderyng mas of Ã¾at souerayne swetnes Ã¾at Ã¾o Holy Gost full of gras has ay, as ?e schyn her expres. ffor swete, blessed, &amp; eke kynde Ã¾o wise mon called hit weterly, ffor al thre as I will fynde hit mas vs quen we han mercy. Swete in worde, for wunderly Ã¾o Apostels speken Ã¾is day quen hit wos ly?t in hom in hy, iche langayge in hor tung lay, &amp; blessyd wos all Ã¾at company In mynde, as ?e leue wele may, quen Ã¾at heuenly tresory in hom wos sett fast, soÃ¾e to say. Kynde Also in werke Ã¾ai wer, quen Ã¾at gost in hom had wro?t, ffor hit made God to hom so der, dethe for hym dredde Ã¾ai no?t. Sapiencie vii?: Spiritus sanctus est suauis, benignus, humilis ex eo, quod suaues, benignos, humiles nos faciat: suaues in sermone, benignos in corde &amp; humiles in opere, &amp;c. Tho thrid kynd I sayd befor Ã¾at Ã¾o dowfe has, as ?e schyn her, In holes of ston euer mor ho byldes &amp; lenges bothe in fer, Quyche holes of ston I vnderstonde Cristes woundes vs to wone in, &amp; wikkednes alway to wovnde, on his passioun ?if we myn. ffor As ho dwelles in holes of ston Ã¾at to his wondes likened bene, so dwellon Ã¾es holy men yche on in Cristes woundes, with-outen wene. ffor quyll Ã¾ai Ã¾enken hom opon, hor hertes bene sett, as wele is sene, In mournyng &amp; in makyng moone, As don Ã¾es dowfes all be-dene. Ã¾er-for Ã¾o Holy Goste to-day In dowfe lykenes wele wos sent, ffor men Ã¾at lyfen, As Ã¾ai done ay, thurgh Ã¾o Holy Gost ben kent. Ãer-for says Salomon in his song, âryse vp my luf, my dowfe der, &amp; norische my bryddes Ay Among, In holes of ston &amp; helpe hom her.â Canticorum secundo: Surge Amica mea, columba mea, fouens mihi pullos in foraminibus petrinis. Ãat dowfe Ã¾o Holy Gost yt is, Ã¾o briddes goode men full of hit, Ã¾o holes Cristes woundes I-wis Ã¾at Ã¾ai on Ã¾enken thurgh hor wytt. Secundo in specie nube. Ão secunde poynt is of our speche Ã¾at God his gost schewed has In clowdes lykenes, As lyues leche, &amp; be gode skyll Ã¾at werke don has. for A cloude ?e mone wele see Ã¾at from Ã¾o erthe is houen heghe, Refresshes, in heyte ?if Ã¾at hit be, And rayne engendres to be neghe. So dos Ã¾o Holy Gost I-wis qwo-so he filles of his godenes, he mas hom to for-sake worldly blis And heues hor hertes to hom expres. Ezechielis viij?: Eleuauit me spiritus inter celum &amp; terram. Item Gregorius: Gustato spiritu de[si]pit omnis caro, &amp;c. Also hit dose grete refresshyng o?ayne heyte brennyng of vice, And Ã¾er-as he will be lengyng nothyng Ã¾at is lodely lys. Therfor quen Gabriell Mary grett, he sayd Ã¾o Holy Gost shuld ly?t In hyr &amp; chadowe oboute hyr sett Ã¾urgh vertu of God most of my?t. Spiritus sanctus superueniet in te &amp; virtus altissimi, &amp;c. Ãat is as meche to vnderstonde Ã¾at chadowe hyr he wolde so with blis, And to slekke all vices so he wold fonde Ã¾at he shuld no way do mys, With water, to tell I will nout wonde, Of Ã¾o Holy Goost i-wis, ffor slekkyng water Ã¾urgh Goddes sonde Ã¾o Holy Gost skekket wele is. Iohannis septimo: fflumina de ventre eius fluent Aque viue. Hoc autem dixit de spiritu sancto, quem erant Accepturi credentes in eum, &amp;c. ffor God calles his gost so, As saynt Iohan wytnes her, Ã¾er-for in clowde of water thoo hyt semed wele he shuld aper. Tho thrid godenes of Goddes gost Ã¾at he engendres in comyng, rayne of teres &amp; wayues boost In monnes herte with sorwe remyng, Ry?t As Ã¾o clowde engendres rayne, Ry?t so teres engendres he, Ã¾er-for to schwe hym he wos bayne In cloude lykenes, As rede we. Psalmus: Flauit spiritus eius &amp; fluent aque, videlicet lacrimarum, &amp;c. Tercio in flatu. Tho thyrd maner he con hym shawe wos in blawyng at Ã¾o mowthe, And monnes blast, kyndly to knawe, Is light &amp; hote, is none vncouthe. Gost-wynd nedefull is to recouer monnes gost Ã¾at greued is, ffor shawing of no thyng mon is leuer Ã¾en softe blast quen he fares mys. So is Ã¾o Holy Gost full ly?t As wynde to entre in monnes tho?t, Ã¾at flees syn &amp; drawes to ry?t, he mas his seyte Ã¾er all vnsoght. Ã¾er-for says Ã¾o glose wele her Ã¾at Goddes gost con not be latte ffrom plas Ã¾at he will to Aper, ffor sone As he comes And all vnfotte. Glosa super [illud]: Factus est repente, nescit tarda molumina spiritus sancti gracia. Item spiritus sanctus calidus est ad inflandum, &amp;c. Also Ã¾o Holy Gost is hote ffor to enflaume as fir dos ay, Goddes worde, As I wele woote, Acordis to Ã¾is, As I shall say, âI comeâ, he says, âto erthe her ffor to put fire Ã¾er-in, And I will Ã¾at hit brenne cler In mennes Eres &amp; no?t blynne.â Luce xii?: ignem mittere in terram &amp; quid volo, nisi vt ardet, &amp;c. Tho fir is called Ã¾o Holy Gost, Ã¾o flaume of hit Ã¾at ese blast Ã¾at Crist blew of my?tes most quen hit to his dysciples past. Ã¾er-for Ã¾at wynde likened is Ã¾at brennes mennes hertes so, To Ã¾o sotheron wynde I-wis, Ã¾at moystes &amp; brennes bothe too. ffor hyt moystes, no-thyng Amys, men te be meke bothe one &amp; moo, And brennes hom Alls, leues wele Ã¾is, To God bothe in weyle &amp; wo. Canticorum iiij??: Surge, Aquilo, veni, Auster, &amp; perfla, &amp;c. Item spiritus sanctus lenis est Ad flatus demulcendum, &amp;c. Also Ã¾o blast Ã¾at Crist so blwe quen his gost opon hom ly?t wos softe to make men hym to swe, As oynement Ã¾at is mad ry?t. Of quiche spekes [Saynt] Iohn, Ã¾at says Ã¾at Cristes enoyntyng teches vs so-qwer we gon to haue knawlage of all thyng. Iohannis Tercio: Vnctio enim eius docet de omnibus, &amp;c. Also to dewe Ã¾at likened is, ffor hit is softe in doun fallyng, As in chirche is songen now Ã¾is, In Latyn as I shall ?ow mynge: Et sui roris intima Asperacione fecundet, &amp;c. Also hit lykened is to Ayr Ã¾at softe is, As ?e schyn see, fforto Amende &amp; no?t enpair he comes, for verray God is he. Regum xx?: Et post ignem cibulus Aure tenus, &amp; ibi dominus. Item necessarius est ad respirandum, &amp;c. An-other profet I may preue Is with mouth of wynde comyng, ffor hit is nedefull for to reve swike Ã¾at mon has in schwyng, &amp; restor Ã¾o gost o?ayn Ã¾at in Ã¾at tempest troublet is, ffor in Ã¾at swyke he my?t be slayn And in wynde or blast tareyng is. So fares hit by tho Holy Gost Ã¾at in softe wynde so geuen was, put hit oway Ã¾at helpes most, to rekeuer mon Ã¾at fayles gras. Aufers spiritum eorum &amp; deficient. Item emitte spiritum tuum &amp; creabuntur. Item Iohannis viij?: Spiritus est qui viuificat, &amp;c. Also Ã¾o Salme says wele her, âSend Ã¾i gost, lord, to Ã¾i men, &amp; made so in A new maner thurgh Ã¾i vertu Ã¾ai schyn be Ã¾en.â De tercio quo tempore missus est. Now hit is profet for to knaw quat tyme Ã¾o Holy Gost wos sent, &amp; querfor As I shall schawe, As doctours sayn now takes entent. In Ã¾o fyfty day he come I-wis After his resurrectioun, to knawe thre [Ã¾]ynges Ã¾at in hym is, ffyrst hor lawes perfectioun, Ã¾at oÃ¾er hor endles mede for Ã¾is, Ã¾e thrid of synnes remissioun. Ã¾at in Ã¾o olde lawe, as rede I, this thyng wos done Ã¾at I shall say, Ãat lawe wos made perfyte Ã¾er-by, be gode resoun preue I may. Primo spiritus sanctus est legis perfectio. In quinquagesimo die missus est spiritus sanctus, vt detur intelligi quoniam A spiritu est legis perfectio, eterna remuneracio &amp; peccatorum remissio, &amp;c. A lombe wos offered reuerently, &amp; after Ã¾o fyfty day The lawe wos gefen [on] Synay in fir to Moyses, in gode fay. So in Ã¾o nwe testament Ã¾o Holy Gost, As leuen we, In fir Ã¾o fyfty day wos sent After Ã¾at Crist rose, leue ?e me. &amp; Ã¾us who-so will take entent, ffor fyrst Ã¾o lombe may likened be To Crist Ã¾at secund lombe wos sent &amp; sacrified, as ?er wos he. Ã¾en ry?t As Moyses law come Ã¾o fyfty day next After Ã¾oo, So Cristes gost in fir doun come To conferme Ã¾es lawes too. Ã¾us sent wos lawe in Synay, Ã¾e Holy Gost in Mount Syon, Ã¾o laghe on heghe hille, as rede I, Ã¾at oÃ¾er in howse ly?t hom opon. So hit schewes wele be this Ã¾at perfection of tho lawe wos thurgh Ã¾o Holy Gost I-wis, &amp; Ã¾en fulfilled, be clerkes sawe. Spiritus plenitudo est mentis, perfectio muneris. Be tho Holy Gost also ffull reward euermor lastyng, As in tho glose Among moo Is wretyn Ã¾is worde wele Acordyng. That ry?t As Crist on erthe her After his resurrexioun ffaurty dayes wos in fer with his disciples, wete ?e moun, And steghe to heuen Ã¾o faurty day, Ã¾at holy chirche may signefy Ã¾at now endures to Goddes pay to wyn euerlastyng blis Ã¾er-by, So may Ã¾o fyfty day I-wis signefy rewarde be resoun, In quiche day kyng of blis Sende his gost to vs Adoun. Item A spiritu sancto venit remissio. Also by Ã¾o Holy Gost Ã¾is day ffelle remyssioun of our syn, And be gode skyll preue I may, As I thenke now er Ã¾at I twyn. ffor in Ã¾o fyfty ?er Alway Sum tyme wos playne remissioun of Cristen thynges, As I shall say, Ã¾at I may after be resoun Put Ã¾o spirituall ?er of grase to Ã¾o temperall dede befor, ffor this remissioun vsed was ffrom Habrahames tyme euermor. Dettes, ?if ony oghyng wer, wer for-gefen weterly, Men that wer exilled comen ner And wer restored thurgh mercy; ?if eny heretage wer lorne, Ã¾at ?er hit wos geuen o?ayne; &amp; suche as in bondayge wer borne, wer made fre &amp; Ã¾er-of fayne; Also such As wer Ã¾o deth worthi, wer delyuerd of presoun, now put we yche grase in hy to gostly playne remissioun. ffyrst Ã¾urgh Ã¾o Holy Gost Ã¾is day, ry?t as dette forgeuen was, so wer synnes, sothe to say, hydde ouer-all Ã¾er he toke plaas. Als in this fyfty day I-wis synne[r]s wele repelled wer to mercy, Ã¾of Ã¾ai diden amys, her-to Acordes Ã¾o Sauter: Spiritus tuus bonus deducet me in terram rectam. Also for heretage Ã¾at wos lost, Ã¾at is erthely paradyse, Crist his blode &amp; flesshe for vs cost, &amp; for Ã¾at heretage put in prise Heuenly paradyse vs to wyn, And Ã¾is day sende his gost doun to conferme Ã¾at he con wyn, ffor quyche he tholed his passioun. Ad Romanos viij?: Ipse spiritus testimonium reddidit spiritui nostro, vt sumus filii dei. Sin autem filii, &amp; heredes, &amp;c. Therfor Saynt Paule says expres Ã¾at Goddis gost full of my?t to our gost beres wytnes Ã¾at Goddes sonnes we ben be ry?t. &amp; ?if we ben his sonnes all, his Ayres we ben of full ayge, &amp; heuenly paradyse vs will fall ffor to clayme for heretayge.

Ad Chorentheos tercio: Vbi spiritus domini, ibi libertas, &amp;c. De iiij?? quociens missus est, videlicet apostolis. Now hit is to knaw ry?t how ofte Ã¾o Holy Gost wos sent to his dysciples, as he ly?t thries I fynde, now takes entent. Befor Ã¾o passioun one tyme was, And after Ã¾o resurrexioun, Tho thrid tyme as this day thurgh gras x. dayes after tho Ascensioun. Ão fyrst for miracles, leue ?e may, The secound to relesshe syn, Ã¾o thrid to comforde vs in tho fay Ã¾at sumtyme befor wer louse Ã¾er in.

Tho thrid tyme wos as this day Psalmus: spiritu oris eius omnis virtus eorum. Ã¾at God Ã¾o Holy Gost doun sent to sadden hom fully in Ã¾o fay to drede no dethe ne tourment. Saynt Austyn spekes of Ã¾is mater &amp; says, âÃ¾o Holy Gostes gras is so mury in his maner, Ã¾of he fynde tristes in Ã¾at plas, âHe vnbyndes hit boute ber &amp; turnes sorwe in-to solas, &amp; ?if wylnyng waxen wer he wayues as thyng Ã¾at neuer was, â&amp; drede he puttes clene oway, on Cristes dysciples as wos sene, ffor fro Ã¾at Ã¾is gifte wos geuen Ã¾is day Mi?t neuer mon turne hom for no tene.â Augustinus: Talis est gracia spiritus sancti, quod, si tristiciam invenerit, dissolui, Si desiderium iniustum, consumit, si tremorem, abiecit, &amp;c. De quinto qualiter missus est. Now how Ã¾o Holy Gost send was hit is to wete &amp; knaw I-wis, with sowene &amp; dyn Ã¾er in Ã¾at plaas &amp; tonges of fir, leue wele Ã¾is, And Ã¾os tonges forthe-schawyng syttyng, Ã¾at iche mon my?t see his felawes on fir flaumyng, As semed Ã¾er to Ã¾at meyne.

He strengthes vpward fer &amp; ner be gyf of wysdome mon to pay, As I in Latyn rede will her, &amp; after in Englisshe mor verray: Spiritus ad modum ignis Alta humiliat per donum timoris &amp; mollet dura per donum pietatis, illuminat obscura per donum sciencie, restringit fflueda per donum consilii, sollidat mollia per donum fortitudinis, clareficat metalla per donum intellectus, sursum tendit per donum sapiencie, vt expressius declarabitur in lingua materna. Primo Alta humiliat per donum timoris. ffyrst he says Ã¾o Holy Gost mas thyng meke Ã¾at is heghe, As fir abates alway boost of all thynges Ã¾at hit comes neghe. Ã¾en calles Ã¾o clerke Ã¾is gyfte of drede Ã¾o proude mon dredes noght befor, drede of God he most haue nede thurgh Ã¾o Holy Gostes lor.

Tercio illuminat obscura per donum sciencie.

Quarto restringit flueda per donum concilii. Also tho kynde of fir is this, to maystre oÃ¾er elymentes, Saue only Ayr or wynde I-wys, All Ã¾ai enpayren be his presence. So ?if A mon oght to proude be ffro Ã¾at Goddis gost be in hym ly?t, be gode consayle shwes he &amp; rebelnes turnes into ry?t. And thyng Ã¾at be foly is ouer-flette Restrayned is be gode resoun, And be sadde sothenes in hert sette be counsayl from Crist comen doun. Quinto solidat mollia per donum fortitudinis. Also fir mas softe thyng harde be strengthe Ã¾at he has in his kynde, So heuenly fir thyng all frowarde In faythe he saddes, as I fynde, Be full strength Ã¾at he in hym has, As be ensample mon may see; ffor er Ã¾o Holy Gost send was ffaynt &amp; freyle wos Ã¾at meyne, &amp; in Ã¾o byleue wos sadde none Tyll Ã¾is fir wos from heuen sent, bot Ã¾en sadde Ã¾ai wer yche one, Ã¾at chaunge my?t no thyng hor entent.

Nota de septimo per donum sapiencie. Also fyr be way of kynde A steme has allway vp-steghyng, So fares Ã¾o Holy Gost I fynde And heuenly fir in hert feghtyng, for quyll he brennes in monnes mynde Tho hert is towarde heuen hyghyng, Ã¾o deuell may not Ã¾at bonde vnbynde quyll Ã¾at fyr is vp-steghyng. Ãerfor Ã¾is fir may called be Tho gyfte of wysdome And of wytte, ffor full wysdome engendret he In monnes saule Ã¾urgh strengeth of hit. Secunda causa quare apparuit in specie ignis pocius quam in Alio elemento sumitur penes sue deitatis excellenciam, &amp;c. The secunde cause quy he don went In fir lykenes to mon-kynde helder Ã¾en in oÃ¾er element, I shall declare now as I fynde. ffor fir is mor excellent in thre maners, take Ã¾is in mynde, Ã¾en ony other elyment, And mor curiouse in his kynde, In schappe, in ordre &amp; vertue eke. &amp; in schappe I shall say quy, ffor fayren Ã¾en fir no mon may seke Ã¾er leghtnes none so louelely; Be ordre also preue I may hit passes other mony moo, ffor herr Ã¾en oÃ¾er fir is Ay In settyng &amp; doyng eke also; &amp; vertu hit has als weterly mor Ã¾en Ã¾es other thre, &amp; strengthe Ã¾er he comes by to maystre hom all, leue ?e me. So fares hit of Ã¾o Holy Gost of fayrenes he passes all, &amp; in rewle &amp; ordre als is moost ffor of All gostes he is wall, And of vertue weterly So excellent Ã¾er may none be, As in Latyn preue will I ffor clerkes be Autorite: Sapiencie Septimo: Primo dicitur spiritus sanctus non quoinquinatus, pro secundo capit omnes spiritus intelligibiles, pro tercio habens omnem virtutem, &amp;c. Tercio sumitur penes multiplicem proprius efficaciam. Tho thrid cause wele taken is ffor kyndely profet Ã¾at fir has, And faur kyndes he has I-wis, Reherse I will now in this plaas. Ignis iiij?? habet naturas, videlicet vrit, purgat, calefacit, illuminat, &amp;c. ffir purges, lyghtes, hetes, &amp; brennes, All Ã¾es faur kyndes has he, So heuenly fyr brennes synnes Tho selfe maner, as ?e schyn see. ffor heuenly fir brennes synne her-to Acordes prophecy, on quiche in Latyn I shall myn Ã¾at speke Ã¾o prophet Zacary: Zacarias: Per ignem vram inter eos, sicut vritur Argentum. Item vre renes meos &amp; cor meum, &amp;c. Also Ã¾is heuenly fir in fay purges hertes Ã¾at hit comes in, As tho prophete prays ay, ffrom temptacion for to twyn, ffor this fir will come no way, Ã¾er baret is, till bale blyn &amp; Ã¾at plas purget al to his pay, er he take sesoun Ã¾er er wos syn. Issay iiij??: Si sanguinem Ierusalem lauerit de medio eius in spiritu Iudicii et Ardoris. Also Ã¾o Holy Gost wele heytes Ã¾o saules in queche he tas seyson, ffor gostly fir all godenes getes In mon Amendet, triste ?e mone. Ad Romanos xii?: spiritu eruentes. Here-to Acordes Gregory And says, âÃ¾o Holy Gost come doun In fir to put Away in hye All coolde &amp; foule corrupcion, âAnd God forthires ay Ã¾at fyr Thurgh his endles mercy Ay mor &amp; mor to gode desir, &amp; mon to leue deuoutely.â Gregorius: In igne Apparuit spiritus sanctus, quia ab omni corde quod replet, torporem frigoris excutit &amp; hoc in desiderio sue eternitatis accendit, &amp;c. Item spiritus sanctus illustrat ignorancias. Also, As I shall now schew, Ã¾e Holy Gost dose maystry, leghtnes hertes for to knaw vnknawen thyng All fully; Ry?t As fir is to vs lyght And in thesternes mas wele to se, Ã¾o heuenly fir mas hertes bry?t, Of thyng vnknawen wise to be. Sapiencie ix?: Sensum Autem tuum quis sciet, nisi tu crederis sapienciam &amp; miseris spiritum sanctum tuum de altissimis. Therefor Salomon here in sight As wytty &amp; wyse As was he, he Askes heuenly God almyght To knaw his wytte, what way schyn we, Bot only ?if he send vs doun ffrom heuen his gost Ã¾urgh his grace To teche ws Ã¾at we knaw moun, sadde wytt o?ayns Sathanas. Ad Corentheos Secundo: Nobis autem reuelauit dominus per spiritum sanctum, &amp;c. [Quart]a causa quare pocius Apparuit in specie ignibus quam in alio elemento sumitur Amoris ipsius naturam &amp;c. Tho [furthe] cause quy he Apered helder in fourme of fir this day Ã¾en in other element, As I am lered, As clerkes techen sothe to say. ffor this skylle taken is truly two maner kynde of his grete luf, ffor luff fyr may signefy, And luff is A gost Abuff. Be thre skylles fynde I may, quy luff to fyr lykened is; Tho fyrst for fir is steryng Ay, So dose tho Holy Gost Iwis, ffor qwo-so he fulfilles in fay, he mas hym to meeue not Amys, In gode wurchyng to be alway, ffor Gregory wele preues this: Gregorius: Numquam est Amor dei ociosus. Operatur enim magna si est. Si autem operari neclegit, Amor non est, &amp;c. âffor Goddes lufâ, says Gregory, âIs neuer-mor ydell, leue ?e me, Bot worches All-way wonderly In iche plase Ã¾er-as is he. âAnd ?if Ã¾at luff be neclegent ffor to wurche wyt gode wille, hit is no luff verament ffor luff con not holde hym stille.â Tho secunde skyll schaw I may Quy luff And fir ben sette in fere, ffor of All elementes in fay worthiest hit is &amp; moost der, And most in syght sothe to say, And leest hit is As of matere, So fares tho Holy Gost Alway Tho selfe maner, As ?e schyn here. ffor what mon so full-fylled ys Of tho Holy Gostes luff, To erthely thyng no hert has he Bot wilnes heuenly blis Abuff, And litell wille to Ã¾o worlde he has Bot meche to thyng that gostly is, Suche is tho Holy Gostes gras And lykened wele to fir I-wis. The thryd skylle now takes hede, ffor thre thynges, As I fynde, That fire has, As I schall rede Qwyll this mater is in mynde. ffyrst fir makes hegh thynges to encline, And vpward also draghes he, ouer-fletyng with-owten pyne he geders to-geder, leue ?e me. By Ã¾es iii vnderstonde I may iij maner of strengthes Ã¾at luf has lyke to Ã¾es iij, sothe to say, As Denys clerke mynde mas: Ignis habet alta inclinare, sursum tendere, fluida adunare &amp; congregare. Dionisius in libro de diuinis nominibus: Amor habet triplicem vim videlicet inclinatiuam eleuatiuam, &amp; concordatiuam. ffor luf has strenght to draghe down thyng Ã¾at is hegh my?tily, ffor to haue neuer so grete renown luf may thow hym bonerly, Hel[d]er Ã¾en batayl to be bown, to encline all curtesly to all thyng, Ã¾at is resoun ther othr waye fayles fullely. Amor habet vim eleuatiuam. Also luf makes loghe thyng hegh, be mony wayes mon may se, As men Ã¾at ben grete lordis negh, who-so is lufd, on heght gos he. Item habet vim concordatiuam The thrid vertue Ã¾at luf has Euen &amp; euen he brennes in fer, thogh wrath be &amp; manas, luf maystres hom in meke maner. Inclinatiuam, quia inclinat superiora inferioribus, Eleuatiuam, quia eleuat inferiores superioribus, concordatiuam, quia concordat equalia equalibus. Dionisius. Thes thre maners of strenght luf has In seche men as the Holy Gost fulfilles Ã¾rugh his grace, ffyrst he abates all hor bost. To wynne hom to grete mekenes &amp; forsakyng of hor wille, No?t takyng honour ne heghnes bot Goddes plesaunce to fulfille. Also Ã¾e Holy Gost is Aye vp-hevyng as fir is in kynd, &amp; also, as I con say A litell befor as ?e mone fynd, ffor Ã¾e Holy Gost vp-heues Mennes hertes forto dys[yr]e heuenly blis, Ã¾er-by hit preues Ã¾at verray luf is heuenly fir. All men Ã¾at entres with-inne, ichon to oÃ¾er he mas der, trew to be &amp; neuer mor twynne, As by ensaumple men may ler Of maters Ã¾at men movn mynne, Ã¾at all tourment with hert enter Sufferd, er Ã¾ai wolden synne, ffull stydfastly in this world her, And Ã¾at suffrauns most nede be by vertue of Ã¾e Holy Gost, Ã¾at with so stabull charite In myschef to luf hym most. Quare spiritus sanctus pocius apparuit in lingua quam in alio membro iij? est ratio, vnde patet vt supra. de iij?. Now whi Ã¾e Holy Gost to-day Appert in tonges helder her Ã¾en in oÃ¾er membres, I shall say thre causes conable &amp; cler. The fyrst, for monnus tong is ay As helle fir cruell &amp; fere, fflaumyng for to make Afray, non othre membre in Ã¾at maner, fful hard for to rule ory?t Ã¾er monnes hert wer oght vnstable, &amp; hit maystret is thurgh my?t A membre wonder prophetabull. Iacobus: Lingua nostra est ignis vniuerse iniquitatis. Therfor syn tong is flawmyng so with brennyng fyr of grete foly, Goddis gost Ã¾o in con go hell-fir for to dystry. Sythen Ã¾at hit among membres mo wos wroght to rule resonably, heuenly fyr most bren Ã¾at fo As dyd this day feruently. Saynt Iames spekes wele of this in A pistell Ã¾at he mas &amp; sayes, âall bestes &amp; foles I-wis to be maystred now wille has Thurgh mon to hym grauntyd was, bot to tempre tong no bote is Bot Ã¾rugh the Holy Gostes gras.â Ã¾erfor hit nedis soueraignys The Holy Gost for to reule hit helder Ã¾en oÃ¾er, As sayd I Acordyng to Ã¾e Apostels wyt: Omnis [n]atura bestiarum, volucrum, serpencium &amp; ceterorum animalium doma[n]tur &amp; domita sunt [a] natura humane; lingu[am] hominum nullius domare potest; inquietum malum, plenum mortifere veneno, &amp;c. Iacobus iij?. In tong also Apperet he to betoken Ã¾at hit wos nede Prechoures wele tonget for to be, ffor to hom mon most takes hede That helle-fyr thenkes for to fle &amp; wille to do gode ri?t As God bede, In iiij maners As ?e schyn see, As I shall Apertly rede: Predicantibus necessarium est lingua spiritu sancto repleta, quia facit eos loqui feruenter, confidenter, multipliciter &amp; vtiliter, &amp;c. ffyrst Ã¾e Holy Gost hem made To preche brennandly aboute, ffor thrugh Ã¾e vertue of hit Ã¾at Ã¾ay hade luff &amp; will no mon to doute, Slauthe wos clene put Away ffor hertes in luff wer so brennyng, herto Acordes, As I shall say, Saynt Bernard of his dovn-comyng: Venit spiritus sanctus super discipulos in linguis igneis vt verba ignea lingue ignee predicarent. Bernardus. âThe Holy Gost,â he says, âcome dovn opon Ã¾e Apostils all in fer In tonges of fyr, to make hom bown brennyng wordes men to her. âAnd Ã¾os tonges of fyr brennyng shulden preche Ã¾e lagh of fyr in fay, As who-so say with carefull hert lengyng, ffor fyr ay lenges whill he may.â Et facit eos loqui confidenter &amp; Absque pusillanimitate. Also Ã¾e Holy Gostes my?t mad all Ã¾e ioyfull cumpany with-owten faynt hert day &amp; ny?t ffor to speke tristely. Her-to Acordes holy writte, &amp; thai speken with grete tryst ffor thai weren fyllet full of hyt, thai myghten say what-ser hom lyst.

Also the Holy Gost comyng mad hom to speke in mony maner, ffor in all languages Ã¾ai wer connyng, men of all nacions for to ler. Holy wrytte is A-cordyng to this, as ?e sone schyn [her]e, Ã¾at Goddis gost mad hom spekyng with diuerse tonges all enter. Actuum apostolorum secundo: Ceperunt loqui variis linguis. Also he shewid prophitably ffor monnes edificacioun, ffor all men wexen bygge Ã¾er-by to suffre bale fully bown. Ysaie lxxxij?: Spiritus domini super quod vincerit me.
