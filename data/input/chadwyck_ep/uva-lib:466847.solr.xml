      <field name="fulltext">“Then let us pray that come it may, As come it will for a' that; That Sense and Worth o'er a' the earth May bear the gree, and a' that. “For a' that, and a' that, It's coming yet for a' that; That man to man the world o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that.” TO W. C. TREVELYAN, ESQ., ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS AND FULFILS THE NOBLE MISSION OF THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, AND IN WHOM THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE AND ANCIENT BIRTH RECEIVE THEIR TRUE LUSTRE FROM THE MOST ENLIGHTENED PHILANTHROPY, THESE TRIFLES ARE DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR, IN TOKEN OF SINCERE RESPECT AND ESTEEM. HUMAN NATURE. The reader may compare with this the passage in an address to England, in the Author's larger work, “Man and Nature,” Vol. i. p. 445, and vol. ii. p. 475. Esteem it godlike to be “man:” to bear All the conditions of humanity; Think nought can disennoble thee, save thy Own thinking so! for that indeed, that were To do so thoroughly—not the low care E'en for the bread that perishes, for by That “man” must live: the sweat, th' obscurity, The hodden gray which Poverty must wear! Deem these all godlike, and such they will grow! Thou canst not think too grandly, no! of man, Nor of thyself, as one! and sure we owe Respect to our ownselves, and, all we can, Should strive t' exalt that nature, which (to make It holy and respectworth in our eyes) E'en God himself did not disdain to take Upon him, aye, and with more miseries Than ever fell to man, thereby to show How high he thought of it! And if he so Respect us, shall we then respect our own- Selves less? Shall that which he himself has shown Worthy of all exertion, and which he Assumed to prove so, seem mean unto thee, Oh man, for whom he did it, whom alone He thought of? God forbid! Then be but thou A man, like him: for has he not taught thee how? And being so, thou canst not fail to see How godlike 'tis to be a “man:” to be, Yea, e'en a beggar! for upon his brow God's finger has engraved “Humanity!” ON HEARING A MUSIC-CLOCK PLAY OUT THE HOUR. Sweetly the closing chime comes on my ear! The hour is flown: breathed soft away, like to The perfume from a flower! and his new- Born brother wakes, delightedly, to hear The call, like some far angel's, to his sphere Returning. This is truest wisdom, thro' Pleasure to mark the step of Time, and strew His path with flowers; and, when we draw near Our end, how wise were we, yea! wiser than The wisest mortal, could we do but as That senseless clock! could we enlarge the span Of Joy and Hope, and from this sad earth pass, With inward music of sweet thoughts, away; Forgetful of the grief, which is, or was, Our heritage; just as those hours play Their closing chimes! could the last note be so, So sweetly held, as scarce to let us know How this life ended, or the next began! As, when the flute is dropp'd, the music still Floats on the air, as tho' 'twere sounding still! LONDON, AFTER MIDNIGHT. Silence broods o'er the mighty Babylon, And Darkness, his twin brother, with him keeps His solemn watch; the wearied city sleeps, And Solitude, strange contrast! muses on The fate of man, there, whence the crowd anon Will scare her with life's tumult! the great deeps Of human thought are stirless, yet there creeps, As 'twere, a far-off hum, scarce heard, then gone, On the still air; it is the beating of The mighty heart, which, shortly, from its sleep Shall start refreshed. Oh Thou, who rul'st above, Be with it in its dreams, and let it keep, Awake, the spirit of pure peace and love, Which thou breath'st thro' it now, so still and deep! GOD'S TEMPLE, AT EVENING-SERVICE-TIME. The lamps are kindled: the High Priest is there! With characters of light the “text” is writ, And by the stars the wondrous page is lit, Whose letters sparkle 'round the dome so fair, And stilly tell, themselves, what sense they bear, Needing no preacher to interpret it! Love's grand text! with which, for man's benefit, God headed Nature's gospel, as it were The “response” of her sublime Litany, The burthen of creation's hymn! Lo! on The temple all the lamps, so silently, Are burning: kindled so, so noiselessly, That not a sound thereof is heard upon The prayer-hushed Earth! and, by their light, that one Eternal “text,” on which the Deity Preaches, not with vain words, but works alone, Is rendered clear, thro' Nature's commentary, (So grand, yet practical,) to every eye! WRITTEN ON THE SEA-SHORE, ON A STORMY DAY, 1832. Roll on, ye everlasting waves, roll on! The music of your voices only, now Can charm me! fling your spray upon my brow, Baptize me thus to Nature; with your tone Of thunder bid me be free as your own Wild motions; hear, ye elements, my vow, Witness, ye winds and lightnings, how I bow In adoration, as before the throne Of Him whose viewless Spirit o'er your face, Ye deeps! now passes; wash from me all trace Of earth: from head to foot burst over me, With your sublime ablution! hear, thou sea! Baptize me “man,” restore me to my place 'Mongst these eternal elements! and ye, Fit witnesses, with holy jubilee, Record how Nature gives me back her grace, The sublime birthright of Humanity! TO BUONAPARTE. See the work before referred to, vol. i.p.311. stanza 34, et seq. Napoleon! thy triumphs and thy pride Have passed away: the fearful wounds, which thou Inflictedst upon Earth, are closed; her brow Is calm, the Heart within her mighty side Broods on its sublime task: her hopes abide Unshaken; nay, the ground, which thou didst plough With fire and sword, is pushing forth e'en now The divine seed! Thy deeds no more divide Men's agitated thoughts—mankind is still, For it has higher tasks than to fulfil Thy mandates: it thinks no more upon thee! The tide of passion, brief slave of thy will, Has sunk once more into the mighty sea Of human thought, calm in its primal majesty! ON DOING NO INJURY. See “Man and Nature,” vol.i. p.277. Wrong thou no living being, tho' but by The least ill thought; for tho' sure that it ne'er Can be discovered, yet there is, I fear, Still one to whom it must unfailingly Be known: thyself! and thus the injury Is done to thee! and this will become clear, Wilt thou but think what man should hold most dear, His soul, and all else for it! now if thy Own self-respect be lessened by a thought Or act of thine, hast thou not thereby done Thyself a lasting injury, which naught Can make good to thee? thou hast in thine own Eyes lessened thyself; the worst ill! and one Which none, but thou thyself, could e'er have wrought! THOUGHTS ON ROADSIDE SEATS, AND THEIR MORAL. 1. I love to feel the firm earth 'neath my feet, The solid ground of life's reality! I like to live too by the daily eye And heart, and e'en the meanest thing I meet With kindly recognition still to greet; 'Tis not so if my heart but feels thereby Its Best—then has it its sublimity! I love not dreams, save such as, on this seat, With quickened pulse of heart, and waking sight, I now indulge—such as God himself might Dream, could he ever dream!—which steadily By God's broad day bear looking into! yea! Such as ne'er hover 'round the brows of Sleep! Well may heaven's blessed light, transfiguring, steep This rude, yet sublime symbol, by the way Of human love! which stirs the heart more deep Than pompous eulogy, or poet's lay! 2. Blessings be on his head who placed it here! Who, of poor human nature's destiny Still mindful, sought to sweeten, tho' but by A moment's rest, its hard path towards the bier! It bears no name, inscription—yet in clear And sublime characters its meaning high Is graven—“sacred to Humanity!” And from what altar would God sooner hear A prayer addressed to Him? then kneel, oh man! And pray for godlike modesty like this To work the Godlike likewise under His, And not thy, name! and this the poorest can! To serve man, man's best glory, none need miss! And he who can't do so none has, nor—is! ON SELF-DENIAL. Deny thyself, and that which thou deni- Est thyself will be godlike gain—will be As measurelessly more than all that the Fulfilment of thy wish, yea, in its high- Est sense could bring, as the Godlike, which thy Heart thro' it feels, than all else unto thee: For, if felt, all else but as nought thou'lt see Compared therewith; make thou ungrudgingly The will of others, and their pleasure, thine; Thus wilt thou have the enjoyment, not of one, But many hearts, yet all still as thine own! In doing good give thou thereof no sign; Be viewless as the wind: pass on unknown, Merged, like thy Maker, in thy work divine! ALWAYS IN GOD'S SIGHT; OR, THE EVENING STAR. Behold yon star, that gleams and sparkles thro' The firmament, like some unwearied eye Of Love, bent on thee ever silently, As mindful of the least thing thou can'st do! Believe it such; believe that it can tru- Ly see thy thoughts: then will thy heart be by Its pure light filled, as thine eye outwardly; Then wilt thou look up at it as unto His father's eye the little child, and bend Thy head in awe, as fearful to offend; And then 'twill be the eye of God! yea, his Own loving eye, to guide thee and defend; And all thy dear one's eyes gaze down in this One star of love, (in which all heaven's bliss Is summed for thee,) still with thee to the end! THE MORALITY OF CHARITY. 1. Look never upon woman, even tho' Sinning, as fallen,—for that were to make One sin inherit all, and from her take The last, sole step Hope's foot rests on, and throw Despair 'twixt her and heaven; thou dost owe Awe to all women, for thy mother's sake! And thou insultest her, when thou dost break A jest on woman's virtue; do not show, But cast the godlike veil of charity Around, her failings: bring not thou unto Her cheek the blush of shame, but let thine eye Be like God's in its sublime modesty! Which, seeming not to see, tho' it looks thro' The inmost heart, spares to the sinner's view His sore offence! Go, do likewise; thus by Thee treated still as holy, she will try To seem what she is thought, and grow so too! 2. Be thou like one of Jacob's angels on The ladder: one of those beneficent Good spirits, to poor erring mortals sent; Tho' thou wert virtue itself, without one Least speck, yet angels themselves bear upon Their shoulders wings of light, as if God meant To emblem thus, how swift on good intent The act should tread: that virtue is alone Unwearied readiness to good! Then be Not proud of virtue, for pride makes it vice! Bare no one's failings, that the world may see Thy greater purity; God, too, has eyes; But He in secret sees, corrects likewise In secret! He points not, vain fool! like thee, Scorn's slow, insulting finger, neither cries, Tho' He is God, ‘how different from me!’ 3. Then handle woman's name more gently than Thou would'st the budding rose: scarce breathe upon It with Respect's hushed breath; touch not, not one Of her least failings which in love began: Their source should make them holy! For, O man, 'Twas love to thee which prompted them alone. And wilt thou visit on her head thine own Offences? because thy love had not span Enough t' embrace all that it held most dear, And yield it all for her sake, wilt thou be A brute to her for doing so to thee? For doing what thou could'st not, with thy fear Of consequences, thy cold head, which aye Makes thy love but fine talk! but she is near, Far nearer, unto God, yea, by her ve- Ry faults, than thou by all thy virtue! yea, Better it is with love to go astray, Than, without love, from error to be free! 4. How godlike must not love then be, which so Can sanctify transgression, yea, e'en to The eye of God himself, who sees all thro' Love, as seen truest thus? And would'st thou blow With sullying breath on it, O man! and throw Away this rose of Paradise, which grew For thee, earth's one, sole thornless flower, to strew The bier of all that's great and good below? O woman! ministering angel, be Thy name then holy; let none think of thee, But as the sister, mother, wife; let e'en The frail be thought of, not as what they've been, But what they may become! yea, let us see The good alone, and, labouring in love, By love work miracles, like Him above! 5. Do we not of the rose itself require That it be quite a rose, and give forth scent, Knowing that God the means thereto hath lent? And shall we less of woman? No! the higher We deem of her, the more will she aspire; Ask the Godlike of her, she'll yield it too, Sure as the rose its divine scent can do. But there be some, who laugh at chivalry, Love, faith, and all high feeling; these are they Who from God's altar snatch the fire away, Who break each charm of life, and now would try To trouble the springhead of poesy, Of godlike thought and godlike act, and make Its once pure waters no more fit to slake Man's divine thirst! Yea, these men now would prove Woman no more divine, not e'en by love, Which is her being, as God's too! but let Her love on still, and man will not forget In her the angel sent him from the sky! ON LOVING. Have something still to love, e'en tho' it be Naught but a flower: yea, the worm below Thy feet itself—for Love and Hope are so Twinn'd with each other, closely join'd as the Two rosebuds on one stalk, that still where we First love, there, too, we hope; and these, you know, Are the springheads of being, whence must flow Its relish and its charm; an eye to see All things with love, that is the highest good: Yea, all in one! it is the microscope, With which new worlds of beauty we may ope, E'en in the smallest thing that round us lies; And yet the telescope, with which to show Glories beyond the stars, and open throw The gates of heaven! for where love is, what should There not be also? Love can grasp the skies! And he who simply loves has all he could Of bliss, in each of its varieties; Lo! in how small a space, all Paradise! WHO ARE ASLEEP REALLY? 1. Reader, my verse may sometimes seem to thee A dream, but matter of mere fact it is; I'm broad awake, as God, I stamp, and this So solid earth stands moveless under me. I look up, and th' eternal blue I see! And could I there without its spirit miss, Yet what I feel within me, that is His Own Self, and where could He then nearer be? Naught, naught has passed away! all, all is there! The Daisy, as when first I plucked it, and The bird's old primal song, the balmy air, And yon just opening rosebud by it fann'd! Yea! I am broad awake—I stretch my hand And pluck it: 'tis a rose, godlike and fair! 2. All is not dream that seems so unto thee; Some things, called dreams, are more real than aught eye Or ear attest, or crucible can try: The feeling of this world is unto me More real than e'en the world itself can be To many: it has no reality To them—for they do not live in and by Its inward sentiment; to merely see Is to see naught: unto the very sight Th' Apollo exists not, until felt too. I said this was a rose, and I was right, For I felt all the Godlike and the True, Which make up e'en that rose, as certainly As colour and perfume: for more goes to A rose than merely these; by God's own light I saw it—must have been awake to do So: for that light falls on no sleep-dulled eye, And who sees by it, sees naught dreamingly! ODE, ON ANNIBAL CARRACCI'S PICTURE OF THE NYMPH PLAYING TO THE FAUN. 1 O, happy Nymph! what song play'st thou unto The antique trees, and yonder listening Faun? On whom are bent thine eyes, of laughing blue, That know no more, than doth the star of morn, Of grief, or the twin-coloured violet? And happy Faun! to bask thus in the ray Of those glad eyes, and list that music clear, Which charms yon sun, so that he ne'er can set; And happier gazer! who can'st bear away Deep at thy heart the quiet pictured here! 2 Play on, fair Nymph, while not a leaf is stirred, And fill the ear of night with harmony; Pipe of so wondrous stop was never heard, Methinks, by any hill in Arcady! Oh, Fancy! thy, thy divine breathings wake That instrument to life, for thou hast sway O'er lifeless things, and quickenest at will; Thine was Amphion's lyre, which had skill To build the Theban walls: for thou can'st make Men's spirits musical, great leadings to obey! 3 Oh Time, thou art the greatest poet still, And man's conceptions ill with thine keep pace; Thou into fiction can'st deep truth instil, Thou liftest up her mask, and show'st the face Of truth eterne beneath it, calm and fair! So deals he here by thee, fair nymph; he lifts, By my weak hand, weak to obey his will, The mask which as a symbol covers thee, And shows the light, the truth beneath it, there Undimm'd; that those who profit by his gifts, Like thee, make life a constant harmony! 4 Play on, then, happy Nymph! altho' unheard Thy melody may seem; yet that which we Believe we hear, by fancy inly stirred, Far sweeter is than any that could be By breath or finger realized! Thy flute Is manifold of stops, oh Phantasie, And every hearer's changing mood doth suit: Yet little skill it takes thereon to play; The stops, these are thy thoughts, and it is thy Own fault if they thy touch will not obey! OVERLOOK NOT TRIFLES. There are no trifles: no, not one in all This wide and lovely world; if trifles were Not so, so oft neglected by us, there Would be few grievous ills: no, nor yet small; Then first there would be trifles, could we call Them so, taught to deem none beneath our care. To God naught, naught is trifling, he can spare Time even for the least: e'en for the fall, Yea, of a leaf! The bee's small girdle is Look'd to, as Saturn's vast belt, which extends A hundred thousand miles! He who great ends Sees not, nor works, in trifles, still must miss Life's greatest end, real living, and with this All others too,—the least chip comprehends, As the whole block, the law of gravity; So life's least duties its sublimity! ON SELF-LOWLINESS. 1. Be modest: dwell not on thyself, on thy Poor works; thy being is but, as it were, A passing breath, lost in the boundless air, The life of all things! is not modesty God's attribute? and wilt thou not be by So sublime an example taught to bear Man's silence, yea! unthankfulness? the fair- Est of his works He points not out: his eye Seems not to see them! from the heavens fade The sunset's gorgeous pageantries, as tho' Not worth a thought: and, the next day array'd In lovelier hues, return, as if to show How little store he set by them, that no Least thought of self e'er dwelt in aught He made! 2. He takes no praise unto himself, nor is Offended, even when his creatures make Light of Him, and his name in mockery take! And what are thy works when compared with His, Oh man! that thou should'st be so proud of this Thy nothingness? no sudden thunders break The heaven's stillness, no winds, blustering, wake To trumpet forth his praises, lest he miss Due notice! e'en his fairest works do show His glory forth, so stilly, modestly, As if they too were conscious what they owe Unto Him! and when they do most, 'tis by That very stillness, whence alone can flow Th' Unutterable wrought unutterably! Then feel thou this, oh man! for if thou dost, Thou wilt not try to utter it, thou must Be silent! yea, as God! and that which He Can't utter, shall that speak, oh fool! by thee? THE BLIND MAN. 1. The poor blind man sits in the magic light Of the full moon: but it cheers not his eye! The moving panorama of the sky, The stream steep'd in its radiance, the bright And flashing waters, burning, as it might Be deem'd, 'round yon dark outline, from the high Old tower, shadowed on them massively, The full, broad orb, above yon woody height, Emerging, 'till the grove, like fire, glows, And in the bush the Lord appears once more! All, all is lost to him and yet, who knows? The soul may see more than eye saw before! Can God, who in the beauty of this night Reveals his Spirit, not find means to pour On the sad heart, tho' haply not through sight, Some portion of this blessed, deep repose, Which seems as Nature's pulse had given o'er To beat, and earth remembered not her throes; Can he not cause the little ear to be The organ of new harmonies: thereto The strings of Nature's harp attach, and through It pour the music of earth, heaven, and sea? 2. Now draw I nearer, silent as a beam Of that calm light! there is no eye to view, No ear to hear, that which I now would do, Save that pure light, which is the holy gleam Of God's own watchful eye; which, tho' it seem To see nought, sees all things, and shows them tru- Ly as they are! softly I drop into His hand my mite, and vanish like a dream, Or breath among the leaves, that whispering dies! Lo! the calm moonlight bathes his drooping head; That halo, with which Nature sanctifies In him Humanity! he sees me not—his eyes Are closed; but, for that reason, in their stead God's are wide open! 'twas God's hand which gave The mite: for mine he saw not, felt not, save Therein; therefore he thanks the Deity's Own hand, and rightly; yea! for had he seen Mine giving it, 'twould not the less have been His Father's hand stretched to him from the skies! And if with sight he could not recognise God's hand, far better were it for him to Be blind, thus with the Spirit's eyes to view That hand alone in life's least agencies! VENICE. 1. Venice! how long has Ocean spread before Thy greatness his eternal mirror? how, How oft upon thy pomp and pride hast thou Gazed in it, and, behold! these are no more! Thou'rt passing from it, like a shadow o'er The deep, blue sea, th' eternal, which is now As ever! but alas! thou'st broke thy vow, Thy bridal vow, and thy strong womb, which bore Titians and Doges, is now barren, and Yields nought, nought more! Lo! 'neath yon sinking sun, The eternal waves are gleaming on the strand, Thy fortune's framers! oft have they helped on Thy fleeting aims, like proud steeds by thy hand Yoked to the car of Triumph, thine alone! 2. And yet, tho' seemingly they served but thee And thine, oh proud one! they were guided by A hand far mightier, which viewlessly Wrought with them far more during ends than the Scant brain of man conceives, or aught that he Can sow the seeds of! yea! such too is thy Lot, Venice; thy sea-cradle momently Becomes thy grave! the waves, the ever free, Th' eternal, bear not long the chains of hu- Man purposes; they are the wings of thought, And by the freest is the Freest brought From land to land; eternal themselves, to Th' Eternal they do homage still, and aught Less during's like clouds on their changeless blue! 3. Behold them in the sunset's purple rays, Like steps of light interminable: on, For ever on, and end there seemeth none! Like some bright threshold, on which Hope might place Her foot to enter Heaven. 'Mid the blaze, The west appears; the day his task hath done, And, thro' the rosy twilight, one by one, The same stars peer! how dreamlike man displays His pomps in face of Nature! but, as 't were, The bubble on yon wave this city here Appears; the firm earth melts away, like air, Beneath her, and, save for the historian's care, Her Past were like the track left on that clear, Deep sea, by her own conquering fleets, which ne'er Shall glad her dim eye more, fixed, in despair, Upon those waves, which in man's vain grief have no share! THOUGHT'S POWER. Art thou not a magician? can'st thou too Not draw a circle round thee, o'er which naught Shall pass? Yea, surely; thou can'st with thy thought Keep all life's ills at bay;—for how, save thro' Thy thought, can aught affect thee, reach unto Thy inner self? all that which Time has brought He takes again; but if the heart be fraught Thereby with all high feelings, with the True And Godlike, what then matters it if he Resume the mere thing given? It has done Enough: made us feel godlike! and if we Feel so through it, all that it e'er could be It is already; then, do this alone, Feel all things godlike, and then Time of none Can rob thee! but to do this rests with thee: For if thou wilt but learn to feel thine own Heart godlike, all things thou thro' it must godlike see! FIRST LOVE. Blessed be the hour when first I gazed on thee! Eve's hour of holy rest, and that one star Which led thy steps to where I stood; what are Years to such moments? as to the young tree The breath of spring, so they to us! yea, the Pure breath of being;—and, oh, how that far Calm star beamed down, with not one cloud to mar Its beauty! as God gazed through it to see The glory of his works! yea, 'twas thine eye, Oh God! and it looked on approvingly! The stars they are thine eyes, yea, every one: Thou lookest forth from all things; and when I Gazed on thee, Love, and felt but love alone, God looked on thee thro' my eyes as his own! UNCHARITABLENESS. 1. Despise naught, till thou find'st naught to despise In thine own bosom: could that e'er be so! Could even earth's least earthly child find no, No human frailty there, in Wisdom's eyes 'Twere but more reason higher still to rise 'Bove all such paltry feelings, which but show Our weakness, and most where we deemed no blow Could reach us, dozing in Security's Too sluggish lap. He who despises the Least thing, should there no other reason be But this, will surely in his own heart find Some leaven of poor, frail mortality: Some ground of self-contempt; thus still may he Find full scope for it there; the true stone blind, These are the proud, the blind may get sight, see Their own faults, and a little charity Covers a multitude of sins! but when We put her godlike eye out in the mind, How should her divine light direct us then? 2. First, when thou hast removed from thine own breast All ground of self-contempt, then would'st thou have Some right to despise others; but what gave Thee that same right, would be the very best Of reasons why thou should'st not; for to be Faultless, like Christ, would take away from thee All power to feel contempt. Then feel none: lest Thy pride outweigh the faults from which thou'rt free! THE GREAT MAN. See “Man and Nature,” vol. i. p. 51, the piece entitled “True Greatness.” 1. Look at him: 'tis a great man! mark him well He shakes your hand just like another, save With holier pressure: his meek eye doth crave No idle notice, it has naught to tell Of its own greatness, save a nameless spell, A look, like that our blessed Saviour gave, Of love, prepared all earthly ills to brave; He speaks like other men: no miracle Assumes he to perform, and yet works many The daily papers mention not his name! No finger points him out as he goes by. His sublime brow would be suffused with shame, Could he believe that any but God's eye Beheld him, or that the loud tongue of Fame Could drown the whisper of the Deity! 2. He values all his glory but as naught Compared with the least act of love from one Whom he holds dear; nor is he great alone When buskin'd for life's stage, or when his thought Energic rouses senates, sternly taught Their duty; he is greatest by his own Fireside, when no eye sees him: there best known, And best loved too; and most the last, as ought To be, because still most the first! he has Time for life's smallest duties: time to say A kind word unto all, to give “good day,” And ask of this and that; for these things as Life's business he regards, and would not pass Them over: no, not pass upon his way The meanest, and not say, as he goes by, “God speed thee, Friend!” for mere Humanity! 3. For mere Humanity! yea, this can make The sweat of labour holy in his eyes; And to mock at, or in unseemly wise Speak of, it, were the same thing as to take God's name in vain; who bade man, for his sake And weal alone, by sweat to realize His bread, its moral leaven; to despise The mass, its joys and labours, were to break The links that bind Man to Humanity; But the great man moves with it, nay, is great By it, by feeling with it—broad and high, On nature based, and human sympathy, Must his foundations be who would create Works that may, like the stars, early and late Be shining, in Man's sight and God's eternally! ON NAPOLEON. Napoleon is said to have been much offended at the title “Emperor” not being used towards him by the Governor Lowe; and these verses are supposed to be addressed to him, pacing, at daybreak, his place of confinement, and watching the morning star fade. 1. And could a truly great mind stoop unto Such paltriness, as to be moved thus by The loss of a vain title? then should I Be led to deem thee neither great nor true! For, had'st thou been at heart so, thy heart thro' All change had followed, and, to thine own eye, Still kept, thee godlike! but since thou could'st by The loss of a mere name, in thine own view, Be lessened, therefore, I too think thee so; For who, save thy ownself, could make thee low? Had but Napoleon, the man, been great, He had not missed the Emperor! vain state Others might rob thee of, but none could bow Thy soul, save thyself, to its altered fate! 2. Was solitude a punishment? were thy Own thoughts such ill companions, in the day Of need, that they who should exalt and play The comforters, the only ones who by The deathbed stand, and in the cell draw nigh, Served but to lower? What then took away Thy foes from thee? a name, the vain display Of illused power, but not the calm eye Of godlike reminiscence: no, not one Good deed! of these thou robd'st thyself alone! The sceptre, which such opportunities Of good can call forth, which men's hearts and eyes Can open, was perverted to thine own Self-ends, and severed from their sympathies! 3. And of the upright monarch's sublime tread, Beneath which blessings from the ground should rise, And founts of song and godlike harmonies, As at the Pegasean stroke 'twas said, Thou mad'st the step of Desolation, 'bove The necks of nations placed, and, as if love Were not among kings' attributes, with dead Did'st pave thy way, and whither has it led? 4. To this lone Isle, this awful solitude, With thoughts of the much ill done, the more good Left undone; to thyself and to thy God, Who for thy sins makes thy own acts the rod; Far more than empires hast thou lost, for now Cain's curse, the stain of blood, is on thy brow! Mankind has cast thee from it, and from thy- Self thou, and naught is left thee but to die! Pace out thy grave, the six, poor, scanty feet, Where nothingness and greatness mocking meet; Gaze, from that spot, upon the boundless sea, By Providence thrown 'twixt the Past and thee, Like an eternity! Gaze on the far Expanse, and in yon dimly-setting star Behold thy fortunes typed, yet not, like thine, To rise no more! with ray undimm'd, divine, 'Twill light far greater spirits to their goal, Who, like it, work but with and for the Whole! Go, hear th' eternal waves, they toil not for The aims of one wild moment, nor the law Of conquerors obey: they flatter not, Like those thou'st left unmindful of thy lot! They'll teach thee that the True and Godlike can Alone exalt, and dwell for aye with man, That only o'er their depths Truth's calm, strong voice Is heard throughout all ages, not the noise And passing uproar of the battle shout, That a few words from her can bring about Far mightier issues than thy troubled dream Conceived; but that is over! and the stream Of time and ocean now have brought thee to Thy journey's end! a grave is all this new Land offers thee; and all that thou hast brought With thee, is thyself, all, or worse than naught! Henceforth this lonely isle shall seem but as A mighty pedestal, to those who pass, Where a God's statue should have stood, still by The eternal mirror glassed unchangingly! But mankind still must wait, till on that base, By Nature raised, Truth the true image place! Thou might'st have occupied it, and the sea Peal'd an eternal hymn of praise to thee; But now of this wide earth six feet is all Thy conquests leave thee: and tho' that be small, Less in the hearts of men thy share shall be! THOUGHTS ON DIFFUSING A TASTE FOR ART AND THE DIGNITY OF DAILY EXISTENCE. The Daily and the Beautiful, why pray Should they not in man's works, as in God's, go Together ever? is the Daily so Far from his highest yearnings, from all sway Of godlike fancy, that these never may Sublime its hopes and pleasures, can have no Connexion with it? or where should we sow The seed of all good things save by the way Where all must pass? the poorest has an eye A godlike eye and heart: then let him be Reminded often of it; yea, make thy Appeal to that alone, to what is high- Est in him, for by that he easily Will comprehend the Highest, which else were A riddle; lay the Godlike fully bare, Give it him, not in this or that degree, But, as the sun its whole warmth to each tree, Give him it full, whole, uncurtailedly, For has not God to him, as unto thee, Thus given his own Spirit? yea, to the Least of his children! and if God thus deem Each fit to feel Him wholly, shall he seem Less in our eyes than in his Maker's? no! Each may be quite godlike, then, treat him so! 2. And he who can feel God, methinks, might see And feel the Beautiful, yea! as felt by A Raphael! then keep it ever nigh His eyes and heart, thus, worshipping it, he Will make “the Beautiful” his Deity, And worship thus the latter too in his Sublimest form! for he who fashioned this So lovely world, can he be better known Than as the Beautiful? is he not shown Forth in this sense by all things? shown forth too So that the Beautiful, and Good, and True, Are all revealed as one! and revealed so That e'en a rose might teach the child to know This text by heart, without one comment, save What its own beauty furnishes; and have Not all the preacher himself on this text Heard preach from one year's end unto the next? Have all not felt him in all things, in grief, And joy, in budding flower and falling leaf, In all that's lovely? thus most in man's own Deep heart, for there the Loveliest dwells alone. And as but one thing can be loveliest, I Need scarcely ask what, of necessity, That one same thing must be! go, ask thy soul: Feel it but godlike first, and 'twill reply Unerring as:—the Spirit of the Whole! 3. Why should the Good not be revealed thro' The Beautiful, its fittest type? it is Most beautiful, when simply so, to his Clear eye who sees in it alone the True; It needs no charm besides to him, no new Or fairer form can bear: he sees but this, Its one, best form, th' essential, with which 't is Arrayed by God himself, and in which too It must return to him, outlasting all Its others. But 't may wisely still and well With Beauty clothe itself, to make its call, Its sublime call, more understandable; Has God not bade the very dayliest, small- Est things this truth so eloquently tell? 4. Then let us do likewise—'tis wisdom, yea! The highest, often to indulge the eye Of Fancy; let it glance from earth to sky, And throw a halo even 'round the clay Of which we're formed! to make of life a play And pastime, yet to lessen not thereby Its graver import and reality, To sport, as childhood, on his holiday, Amid the flowers of Spring, and yet, at the Same time too, with an earnest, sober zeal, Consciously, in the inmost heart, to feel Its deep responsibility, yet still Not as a task, a labour to fulfil, But as a joy to be enjoyed: yea! for The Godlike to the Godlike must give law, It has, can have, no other; and if we Be but godlike, how can the Godlike be A task? it is ourselves! and to be this Can be no more a task to us, than his Own song is to the lark, which is but an Expression of himself, as is to man All godlike action! this, this is to me The highest wisdom; Wisdom, who e'en 'mid His tears can smile, to think of what is hid Beneath them, of the during True, which he Feels thus more in its oneness, which naught can Take from him, not e'en when the coffin-lid He closes o'er his dearest; it but grows More true to him, just thro' the loss of those He lov'd! 'tis snatched, for one brief moment, from His eyes, to be henceforth brought clearer home Unto his Heart! he had beheld it as In many fractions, but now, in the glass Of Life, 'tis given back to him as one, The ground of all things' being and his own! E'en of the flowers, which spring up hard by His path, and for which he has still an eye, Yea! even to the last! still, still an ear To listen to the lark, a silent tear For thoughts too deep for language! yea! for he Has learnt his lore of Nature, and does she, Ere to the harvest and the fruit she bring Our steps, not lead us thro' the flowers of Spring? 5. There is no fruit without the flower, nei- Ther wisdom without joy! he who counts by The hourglass his life, will thus deprive Himself of its best use, nay! fail to live! This is destroying life, to fix the eye On a few sandgrains, as if they could give Even a moment's measure, paltrily Into vile fractions to split up the high And godlike sense of being as a Whole, As One; 'tis as if Ocean should not roll One sublime, indivisibly-grand mass, Ocean at every point from pole to pole! (Like Life betwixt the cradle and the goal,) But into paltry drops be broken; as If at each moment of this life the soul Could not feel it still one, godlike, entire! Not what it at each moment only is, But all Time ere could make it; and, with this True feeling of it, moments have a higher Value and import, yea! than e'en long years Without it! for by this alone th tears And joys, the yearnings and the strivings, of The human heart, can be sublimed above Their outward seeming, sanctified, yea! to The eye of God himself! Life only thro' This feeling can be Life, without is none; Life is the consciousness thereof alone! And he who has felt the whole Godlike, has Fulfilled his life, for that its chief end was, Nay, life itself—for life's not time, it is True feeling, godlike action, and with this The shortest may be full and complete, yea! As is the longest; tho' but one, full, clear Draught, as of ether, of this atmosphere, Breathed consciously as such! but one sweet day, Like a brief, sweet tune on a flute, one ra- Diant morn, with song of bird and opening flower, And one sweet evening's close, soft stealing o'er The eye that sinks with Nature into rest, Sure of the dawn, like her, and, like her, blest To have fulfill'd its task, then pass away, Transfigured in the sunset's last, calm ray; That Halo, which proud conqueror never wore, By holy Nature, sympathizing, thrown Around the good man's end, so like her own! When, at each day's sweet close, her closing eye Looks back on its great work, so modestly, So stilly, and the blessedness of the Past day becomes the dream of that to be; And o'er her rest, the silent stars alone, Watching, its wonders to men's eyes make known! 6. Why should the muse not oftener stoop unto The poor man's cot? to give him of his own Existence the deep music, to make known The poesy which, seldom voiced, runs thro' His daily life? felt but godlike and true, Life is itself a Poem such as none Can equal, yea! it is itself alone Its own best Poesy! tho' very few Feel it as such. What Poet's simile Could, for its beauty and deep meaning, ere With the rose in the poor man's window be Compared? 'tis godlike, so full of the clear, Deep poesy of Nature, for which he Still yearns amid the city's fretful sphere; And, with its scent, he seems awhile to hear The bird's glad song, and breathe the air so free, Enjoying Nature in epitome! 7. That flower to him is life's poesy; It keeps his heart awake, it keeps him true, 'Mid all that's false and artificial, to The During and the Natural; thereby He cherishes the primal sympathy, Exerts Imagination's power, and, thro' Its exercise, becomes a Poet too, The highest, truest! for his daily eye And heart he poetizes, with what lies Around him: 'till his loom, his hammer, and The low, coarse implements used by his hand, Remind him no more of his toil, but rise To view soft as forms which in dreams are scanned, Steeped in Imagination's fairy dies! 8. The Harsh, the Bitter, which they outwardly Suggest, the Sweat, the Labour, this he no More sees; the Inward, Godlike, which doth show Itself, yea! e'en in their coarse forms, his eye Beholds alone! that is, life's poesy Alone he feels, its meaning, which below The surface lies, and which can only flow From the deep sense of its reality! Thus, at the loom, he with it not alone Spins the mere warp and woof, but weaves likewise Life's web so godlike! weaves it from his own Most daily thoughts and feelings, and, scarce known To himself, steeps the threads in Fancy's dies, Which yet are but Life's best realities! 9. Thus are his feelings real to him, yea, as The palpable threads which 'neath his fingers pass! He spins them not from nothing, from vain dreams, But from the living heart within him; yea, 'Tis thus he lives his life, and of one day The godlike consciousness unto him seems A treasure all Earth's gold could ne'er repay; For he feels what life is, and what it may Become: how godlike 'tis to be a “man;” This feeling is the Highest that man can Reach, 'tis the consciousness of Self; for he Whose self is not always unto him the One highest end, and in the highest, pu- Rest sense, lives not! he follows not the true End of all being; nay, he himself is An instrument to things which should to his “Self” be mere instruments! The dullest of All follies is to raise the means above The end, from which they take their worth alone! And this we do, when Reason's godlike eye We keep not fixed, sublimely, steadily, Upon the “man,” but losing sight of this, Th' Eternal in the Accidental miss! 10. Oh, Muse! then keep thou ever in his view This one, grand object; teach him still to be An end unto himself: for thereby he Will estimate life's goods but by the True, Th' Eternal, and, becoming so, then too All means which needful thereto be he'll find Within himself; yea, his own heart and mind Are still the surest means, the only, thro' Which man's perfection and his highest weal Can be wrought out: each thing grows perfect by And thro' itself alone; then let him feel Himself his end, thus too, unfailingly, Man's Highest he'll attain at once, for this Mere feeling is the Highest of which his Nature is capable, just as the rose- 'S perfume is the end for which it grows! Our Highest is not something out of us, It is ourselves, our thoughts, and feelings—thus Thro' these we still must seek it, there is no, No way besides: but if we feel these so, Then is it ours; man's highest feeling is His Highest, and that none need ever miss! Feel grandly, for grand feeling must repay Itself: 'twere none, were there another way! E'en to the poorest beggar who denies Himself, to make him his own miseries Forget, to recompense him fitliest, naught Can God himself beyond that simple thought Itself find out to give! yea, just for this He is God, to reward us as He is Himself rewarded for all sacrifice! And by whom should the Godlike first be taught, If not by Him thro' whom alone 'tis wrought? 11. Then teach man still the Highest, yea, e'en thro' The Lowest, Dayliest, Commonest; thus he Will comprehend the lesson easily! Add thou the Beautiful unto the True, The Noble to the Useful: thus they too Will seem what Wisdom knows them well to be. The fairest form costs little more than the Most vulgar! yea, it costs a lofty view Of nature, life, and man's capacities; It costs that by which godlike things are wrought Alone, pure, godlike feeling, godlike thought, Of that in which true greatness only lies, The Last, the Highest, to which nations rise! Nor deem that great results may not be brought To pass, when Nature's parables are taught By Art, familiar grown to all men's eyes! But far, far other things than these are by The Malthuses and Benthams thought of, men Of the long head and narrow heart, whose pen Would reckon up of poor Humanity Each pulse, and of the godlike beating heart Make but life's supplement, not its chief part, The life of life;—to these Art, Poesy, Are things without a meaning—Man but a Machine, which they with springs and countersprings make play! 12. 'Tis not alone in costly galleries That the true feeling must be fostered; no! Cast the good seed abroad, and it will grow Up everywhere; life's trivialtes Have nothing trivial in Wisdom's eyes; And he who feels his daily life as low, The fault is in him, for he feels it so! And makes it so, for his best energies Are not bent thereunto! A mere plate, on Which Christ, in act to break the bread, should be Depicted, would, methinks, be something won Unto Humanity! No eye could see It without faith and love; and, felt thus, he Would be no more a pictured form alone, But in each heart a living presence, the Real Saviour, breaking there for every one, Who felt him, too his bread, and visibly Blessing it, by that feeling straightway known! 13. What can be more ideal, I pray, than this, Yet more mere fact? How many hearts are by The poesy, the living poesy, Of being touched, who know not what verse is! Yet of its noblest harmonies naught miss! Does God then voice himself alone by thy Proud lips, O poet? has Humanity No music of its own, no melodies, Beyond the broken snatches of thy lyre? Art thou sole heir to Being's harmony? God, God forbid! the poorest heart feels higher, Far higher inspirations, yea, than the All-greatest poet's verse could e'er inspire! Feels God, life's blessedness, and love's pure fire, Man's whole heart! and what more is felt by thee? Each seashell gives the music of the whole Deep sea, and thus too does each human soul, Each feels the great soul in epitome! 14. High thinking in life's least things is best known, And week-day greatness is the hardest, high- Est still of all! The great heart and clear eye Find full scope in the hovel as the throne. Thus Poussin held the light to show his own This noble trait of Poussin was suggested to me by a beautiful sonnet of my highly-gifted friend Mr. Scott, to whom, therefore, I ascribe, as due, the credit of it. Proud guest the door, with godlike modesty; So the sun lights the meanest from that sky Where unapproachable he shines alone! So long godlike, that the Godlike has grown His simple being—wrought unconsciously! That lamp's real ray, tho' round the great man's head, Like, nay, an halo, at that moment shed, Lost on his guest's dull eye, failed thence to claim A recognition: for the artist bore Neither a king's proud look nor idle name, Tho', but as Poussin, measurelessly more! For from Art's spiritual throne, (to tread Whose presence-chamber is the height of fame,) He had stooped to the menial's office, led By godlike pride, where most would feel but shame, In least things, as in greatest, great the same, Nay, greatest in the smallest, for he rose Highest, where still the mean mind meanest shows! He did it without show, as naught, for he So felt it—as God his divinity! The great mind feels the least things great alone, For feeling all things godlike, thus its own Feelings impart to that sublimity; 'Twixt Least and Greatest difference is none, Sand-grain, or world, alike suggest infinity! 15. The Cardinal the Artist pitied, for He had no servant! and the Artist tru- Lier pitied him likewise, because he saw He deemed so slight a want a subject to Be pitied! which was right? Methinks the man Who needs no service, is best served: who can So regulate his thoughts, that these shall do Him service; these accompany him thro' All changes, perils, yea, thro' sickness, death Itself, still faithful, e'en to his last breath! They ask no hire: none can bribe them, and The more they serve, the readier at hand He'll find them ever: servants have but feet, But they have wings to render him, as meet, All spiritual service! and who, pray, Is best served? he who for his body may Have all that he can think of, or he, whose Pure soul, contented with the godlike use Of its high powers, has naught left to require, And want is none, where is no weak desire! Or should there be, he does not gratify The craving, but, subduing it to higher Ends than its own, a godlike victory Reaps where the weak sink deeper in earth's mire! So godlike is man served by his own thought, That will he but think so, he can want naught! 16. Think it not for mankind small Good alone, When thou habituat'st the daily eye To forms full of pure truth and harmony; The Beautiful, which to the sense is shown, Will in the heart its presence soon make known! Man's daily life should be ennobled by All means, that he may deem more worthily Of it and himself! a sublimer tone, Fit prelude to the coming harmonies, Upon Time's mighty harp, the spirit of Humanity has struck: clear notes of love Fill the wide vault of the rejoicing skies; God listens! for a sound is sent above; The mighty Spirit is at work, it plies Its godlike task, mankind is getting eyes, The film is passing off which ages wove, And dreams and hopes sublime, at waking, move, The great heart, conscious of new destinies! TO A FRIEND, AFTER ABSENCE. 1. Dear Friend; there still is a vitality In bygone joys and hours, and they rise, Like ghosts, yet still life's strong realities, And with their primal sunshine cheer the eye, And warm the heart! not only in the sky, Above him, shines the light by which man plies Life's task: but what the passing day denies Of brightness, he from himself can supply. Suns long since set shine on him: he treads o'er Life's old, familiar ground, whose forms now pass, Transfigured, o'er the soul's soft, magic glass! The music of the days which are no more Still cheers him, for his inward ear is, as The seashell, filled with harmonies of yore 2. The distance has not dull'd, but sweetened: made The music but still holier, touchinger; The haste of youth is sobered: the wild stir And effervescence of the soul allayed! The divine instrument may now be played With less breath than a babe breathes on a flute! Yet yield such bursts of harmony, that mute Angels themselves would listening stand, afraid To stir their wings, in speechless ecstasy! This is the player's test—he who knows well The stops of his own thoughts, can wake thereby Music most passing sweet! the Past doth tell His old tales o'er again, the shadowy, Dim outlines grow distinct: the heart beats high, And feelings gush from life's unfathomed well! The old, old primal feelings, fresh and true, As on the untouched rosebud morn's first dew. And these are now awakened in my heart, At thought of those who gave me their best part, That love, which is their best source and end too! NATURE, A REVELATION OF GOD'S RELIGION AND MORAL SCHEME. 1. And shall a nation's progress be delay'd, While priests dispute God's Word, for things of naught, Fit theme for strife! and what edition ought To be received! as if all that He made Bore not his superscription, and display'd Not one same light, one purpose, which, if taught By these false servants, long ere this had wrought His kingdom upon earth; but these a trade Make of His Word, and therefore stickle for Texts and editions; tho' there be but one, His own—the living Bible, which his law So clearly shows; not that of Douay, nor Elsewhere: for matter of dispute is none Therein, nor text with text ere found at war! 2. The living scheme of Nature! yea, this is His Word, his own Edition, where is no, No room for quibbling—and does it not show Forth, not alone his might, as well as His Own written Word, but far, far more than this, Does it not too enforce all that we owe To Man and God, not with vain words, oft so, So pointless, but with pulses of pure bliss, With warning pain, and reminiscence dear? Nor wants the lesson ought that Poesy, Or fittest illustration can supply, To make it one of Love, not Force or Fear; Both, both are there, to bring it home in clear, Intelligible wise, to ear and eye, And heart, that Man may comprehend his destiny! 3. Fling wide the everlasting gates of this Grand temple then, that all may enter there; Long has the Preacher waited, and it were High time that men should listen unto His Own voice, nor thus, thro' selfish teachers, miss The living truth, which his own lips declare. Has He who set in heaven the stars so fair, Left then his other works in darkness? is Not every page by one same light made clear, In his great volume? study there then thy Real good; for Man and Nature are as near Allied as child and mother, and 'tis by Her lips that he will oftenest, clearest hear The real commandments of the Deity! ON A SUNSET LANDSCAPE, SEEN OVER WATER. I looked—the sun was setting rosy red: I gazed with more and more intense delight, As, like a halo of ethereal light, His rays were gathered round the sinking head Of dying day—along the stream were spread The last, faint smiles of Nature, calmly bright, As if on her so holy works her sight, For the last time, were bent, ere Night should wed Them to Oblivion! beyond the stream There lay a happy land, like Paradise; As fair and still as, but too like, a dream! Alas! beyond the stream it ever lies, That happy land, and in the far-off gleam Of spectral suns, unknown to mortal eyes! But yet the spirit can attain the prize, That can pass over, distant tho' it seem! Reader, hast understood? then go, likewise, And let thy soul that fair land realize! For if that dwell there, thou dwell'st in it too, And calmly thence Life's turmoil here may'st view! TO THE POOR. Art thou ashamed of poverty? of thy Low occupation, as it in thine eyes Appears? then of Man and his destinies Thou'st still to learn the end and dignity; Did not Christ by his birth then glorify That poverty? that men might not despise The lowliest state, since it full means supplies For all that makes Man holy in God's eye! And what more would'st thou be? be quite a man, Thine occupation, then, will not seem low; For if thou wilt but think it not so, can It be so? Man is boundlessly more than His occupation, for from him must flow Its worth: thus, if godlike himself, it must be so! Then dare not thou, thou rich fool, to look down On poverty: nor thou, poor man, disown That which thy Lord, for thy sake, underwent! But bear it like him, and the thorny crown Of suffering, by sublime presentiment, Will then become on thine, as on his brow, One, not of pain, but glory even now! HOPE. One eve I lay, half dreaming, half awake, In the fair arms of my true mistress, Hope; Who, seeing me my drowsy eyelids ope, Asked what I most should like? then, for the sake Of trying her, to see if she would take Me at my word, I said, “To enjoy thee:” Thereat she started, like a fawn, from me! Then thought I to myself, tho' she thus break Away, yet will she straight be back again: She is a virgin chaste as unsunned snow, And if we seldom reach her, not in vain We follow; for to the mere chase we owe All, nay, more than she'd give, could we detain Her in our arms, for all hope more than they can know! HOW TO PROFIT BY DETRACTION. E'en when thy foe doth most to slander thee, When o'er thy lines of grace he smears the gall Of Envy, and exaggerates thy small Defects to grievous faults, do not as he: That were to give him license to speak free. Hear him to thy amendment—strictlier call Thyself to task, and see how much of all He lays to thee is true—if any be, Correct it—then, with sublime modesty, Him may'st thou look full in the face, and say, “Go, deal thou likewise by thine enemy!” Exult not, else thy God will turn away His blessing from thy sacrifice—deal by Him as thy Lord—praise in him all he may Of Good possess, thus wil'st thou keep thine eye Fixed still upon the Good alone—and this Is Man's supremest weal; yea! for this is To keep thy Being's Truth entire! reply Not to him as he does to thee—belie Him not, nor set down aught in malice, for That were to break thy Spirit's highest law; In wronging him thou wrong'st thyself far more, Thou lessenest thy love of Truth, a sore, Sore ill, and this naught, naught should make thee do; For unless true to others, thou art not true To thine own self: as a glass which reflects Not things in their truth, its own want of truth detects! TO THE FULL MOON, JULY, 1832. Most glorious Orb, with perfect disc of gold! At length thy brows entire with light are crowned, And from thy bright goal, in the blue Profound, Thou look'st on all that has waxed young and old With and thro' thee, like Seer, who has foretold The things to be, and seen Time's wheel come round Full circle! hush! there is not one least sound, Not e'en a leaf is stirr'd: yet worlds are rolled Unnumbered o'er my head, thro' boundless space! Oh God, how still thou work'st thy wonders! no Least noise thereof in heaven leaves a trace; Silent, as thoughts, each orb moves in its place! While o'er them all yon' calm, full Moon doth throw Her light, which, like thy Love, doth all embrace! WRITTEN BEFORE THE DUKE OF YORK'S COLUMN, 1832. Methinks, I like thy bare sublimity Far better than vain ornament—I love To see thee proudly towering thus above The fret and stir which far beneath thee lie, The paltry fears and passions, heard not by Thy contemplative summit—here I stand, And gaze on thee, thou emblem wisely planned, Pointing with moveless finger to the sky, To mark the path of Immortality! Like thee, must his works be, who would survive His age: upward and upward must he strive, 'Till with the stars he hold communion! No crown, no glory, must he wear upon His brows, save that which Heaven alone can give, Its own pure light, which none have ever won, Save those who by and in it only live! TO MY FRIEND, W. C. TREVELYAN. O Thou, who wearëst Fortune's gifts as thy Least ornaments, whose hand is ready as Occasion—thou on thyself in the glass Of this our common, bare Humanity Hast wisely look'd betimes, not, like thy class, In Fashion's mirror, nor in her dull farce Been found— thus hast thou Man's true dignity Judged rightly—there hast seen how much more by What all men have in common Man is rais'd, (Tho' his the Poet's tongue, or Prophet's eye,) Than by aught that the few e'er priz'd or prais'd! Then serve it still, as thou hast worthily Done hitherto—thus thou the Deity Best servëst! thus thou'lt leave far more than fame Or fortune—many grateful hearts, to pray For thee to God, who, what they can't repay Thee, will! yea! for Heav'n's treasures are the same To Rich and Poor: or rather, for delay Of earthly Goods, these of their “Father” may Ask more of heavenly! yea! for their claim Is stronger, as their right to call Him by that name! I weave no wreath of idle praise, my Friend, For thee—for, at the best, I can but lend A rhyme to thy sublimer poesy! To act, 's to poetize like Deity! FINIS.</field>
