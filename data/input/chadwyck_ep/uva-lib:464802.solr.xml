      <field name="fulltext">TYPHON: OR, The Gyants War WITH The Gods. A MOCK POEM. In Five Canto's THE Argument OF THE WHOLE. The Gyant Typhon's mighty strength; His courage, inches, and his length: The threats, the menaces and odds 'Twixt him, the Gyants and the Gods. Those wonders which as yet but few know, Besides those Gods and Madam Juno; And they are wiser then to tell Disasters to themselves befell. The nimble God from heaven sent Returnes with Gyants Complement: At which the Gods begin to tremble, And straight a Parliament assembles; Who for preventing future harms, Consult on manner of their Arms: Debating long, it is decreed That Vulcan fall to work with speed. The Gyants give the first Alarm With ill success: again they arm, Renew a second time the fight With like success, are put to flight. Back they return, and gain the odds; They rout, and they pursue the Gods, Who cunningly do vary shape In Wood, the better to escape. The Gods bethink it base to range In Woods like beasts, and therefore change Their borrow'd shapes: at Nylus-banks God Mercury performs his pranks They cloath themselves, to Memphis go; The Priest and People kindness show: Great Hercules they send for, who Attends them with no more ado. Jove and his son Alcides go By joynt consent in quest of foe. Gyants scale heaven to a wonder; From thence are headlong thrown by Thunder. A fight determines; where's the odds, On Gyants side, or on the Gods. Gyants are slaine, and Typhon flies: Great Jove pursues, and Typhon dies. CANTO I. The Argument The Gyant Typhon's mighty strength; His courage, inches, and his length: The threats, the menaces and odds 'Twixt him, the Gyants and the Gods. Those wonders which as yet but few know, Besides those Gods and Madam Juno; And they are wiser then to tell Disasters to themselves befel: I Sing (though not in strain as they In ev'ry line do merit Bay) Not Hector, or the brave Æneas, Amphiarus, nor Dapaneus; Nor yet of Thetis valiant son, Nor Prentice stout of famous Lon- Don-Town; they're all such little brats, That unto these they seem but Sprats Of whose bold deeds I mean to write: I chant o' th' man so full of might, Before whom Thunder-thumphing Jove Ran swifter then from Hawk doth Dove. I treat of horrid Typhon's acts, Whose eyes do equalize his facts, And out of whose each shoulder springs As many arms as there are Strings On all the Fiddles of this Town, Or Sheep that graze on Barsted-down. Among which arms there doth appear A head would cause Old Nick to fear, And tremble too, did he but gaze on't, I'll lay a Picce with him that layes on't. So cross a Rogue was never seen By Begger blinde of Bednal-green With both his eyes. So much for that: Now of his Brothers I must chat A while; and let you understand, Such children never were of Land, (Nor of the Earth; but for Rhimes sake, The Land for Earth this time I take.) But to the point: pox on the Rhime, 'Thas forc'd me to commit a Crime Against exactness.) These Braves then, Who look'd like devils more then men, Yeelded not in the least for strength, For thickness, talness, bredth or length, For rooting strong oaks, tearing rocks, Breaking doors, or picking locks, Passing the Seas without a bridge, Or skipping o'er a great house-ridge; Making a Switch of greatest Oak, With which the bones of Gods they broke That ne'er did brag on't (when return'd Up to the heav'ns, where had sojourn'd Their Godships) unto their said brother Both by the father and the mother. I have digressed somewhat long: No matter, now I'll to't ding-dong. You Muses nine that saw the fight From horrid mount, and in what plight The Gods were, when great Jove with fear Ran here and there, and everywhere; Upon his Horse-bird got astride; The devil take the hindmost, cry'd; And ran as swift from Pole to Pole, As if h'd had at his bum-hole The God of Fire; in danger great To break his neck ere the retreat Had been accomplisht; till his Bird On Nilus-sands did drop a T? Fain would I know the thing (or shape) The fearful Gods did deign to Ape: For this most certain is, and true, They all did fear and tremble too: But whether Conquest Gyants great Did favour, or the Gods did beat, Is not confirm'd; for since that time Has not been seen in any clime Gyants nor Gods; which makes some say There's no such thing (a-lack-a-day!) As Muses nine, or God Apollo. But mark you what doth after follow: For Mercury (the King of Posts) Brings this same news from both the hosts. All in the Land of Lumbardy There dwelt, a Kyte? no, let me see, There dwelt a Gyant: now I'll speed, (The better day, the better deed) 'Twas on a Sunday just past noon, That Typhon having with a Spoon Big as is an English Wherry, Cramb'd as much as Gut could carry Of Whales white-broth, and of the meat, Which in his Maw did cause a heat, Invited Brothers, gentile Lubbers, To play with him at Nine-pins, Rubbers. I think 'tis fit to let you know, Before I any further go, Those Pins they were long-pointed rocks That with his hands, and some few knocks H'ad fram'd, that they lookt even so: The Bowl beat out (by strength of blow) Of the same stuff; though not so round, But that there might be rounder sound. It was about the midst of May, When jolly was the world, and gay: Thessalia was the proper place In which this jovial Gyant-race Did make their Match, in Recreation To play a Set for a Collation At Nine-pins. Eight did fiercely play; The other betted (as some say.) The three first Games this gallant troop Did play, they took the pains to stoop, And minde their sport: but growing hot With tossing too much of the Pot, (For they had Ale and strong Beer plenty, More then enough for them and twenty) They grew to words, from words to blows: But Typhon with the crooked nose Stept in between, and cry'd out, Peace; Whereat the hubbub straight did cease, So that they spent the whole long day Without a blow, or farther fray Then has bin mention'd. But much better It had been, to prevent a greater Mischief, had each giv'n to his mate A rouzing blow upon the pate, And cross the shins a thousand knocks, Then Typhon with the snakie locks Had with a Pin got such a blow, As made him rub from knee to toe. It was the great Encelades (Pox on his picture) broke the peace; Though some say 'twas against his will, And meerly by the want of skill: But Typhon ne'ertheless was neer, For knock exchanging cuff o' th' ear. But having made on deed reflexion, And of his thoughts a recollection, Still grinning in disdainful wise, And Lightning flashing from his eyes, He gather'd Nine-pins up and Boul, (No Gyant daring him controul) And hurl'd them up with such a might, As that they vanisht out of sight, And could no more be seen by eyes, But in a moment pierc'd the skies, And to augment the Gyants wonder, Did rattle there as claps of Thunder, Rushing into the very place Where Gods the Goddesses embrace: Though they poor souls did not surmize That Nine-pins would idolatrize: But cramming Panches full with Nectar, Such as the Goddesses expect for Appetite, but by reversion; For there they hold it an aspersion, As they in France allow a woman To gurmundize and drink with no man; But now and then in private they Will tipple Nectar fast as Whey. And thus the Gods resolv'd to drink, Till night appear'd as black as Ink. Stout Mars took nothing but Tobacco, Caring not a Fart for Sack though, Shunning all celestial rooms Not scented with Tobacco's fumes. For since in Holland he had been, And purchas'd Honour to the keen- Ness of his weapon, he would dare With any's valour to compare; That being noted for a Bragger, Some Wags ycleped him Sword-dragger: Yet lov'd he nothing more then smoak And Beer, for which he'd pawn his Cloak, And did; but nought could yet prevail, To work a league with him and Ale: A firy God, and so uncivil, He onely liv'd to drink and drivel; True signe his birth and bringing up Proceeded from the Pipe and Cup. But Jupiter, who drank his fill, Lay fast asleep close by his Gill: Juno lay by Silenus's Ass: (He Bacchus foster-father was.) Who saw them in this plight, might think They had but little need of drink. I will not say, Here lay a Punk, Or there lay one was worse: but drunk They were like Gods; and ev'ry Goddess Lay reeking as the joynt that sod is. Drink by Philosophy we finde, Quells perturbations of the minde; Dissolves those cares that do controul The life and vigour of the soul. In such a sleep the Gods were cast: But when a nap or two was past, They being frighted with the noise Caus'd by those Nine-pins, Gyant-boys Had flung; Jove starting up, quoth he, Is this a time to disagree? Dissentions are for mortal elves; Gods should agree among themselves. By this we seem as Fools and Cods heads, With Nine-pins to assault the Gods heads. The Deities by this time heard Joves voice, which made them sore afeard: When scales were from the eye-lids broke, Had they known how, they would have spoke; But standing all as in a maze, With eyes did nothing else but gaze, Quoth Jupiter once more, Who's there? Where are you all? Bring me a Chayr. But Venus half awake (good heart) In stead of answer, let a fart: But straightway conscious of a guilt, And fearing scent from what was spilt; Quoth she, 'Tis nothing, dreadful Sir. You lye, you Whore; I heard a stir, And I will know what is the matter. Thus Jove continu'd raving at her. Venus said nought, but thought the more, And pouted at the stile of Whore. Jove raging still more fierce and mad, Well may we think not one was glad. Twice, by the Alcoran he swore, And bit his thumbs as oft, or more. Pallas observing well this fit, Forsakes the place where she doth sit, Or lie, 'tis no great matter which; It seems her fingers ends did itch To be with Jove: so having bow'd, Spoke words like these, (but not aloud) Great Sir, whose anger is as fire, Consuming such as feel your ire, Be as a God, more prone to love Then to destroy: Oh let me move Your pitie; hearken unto me: Those Cups which on the ground you see Broke into fitters, and those Glasses, Are all your own: but now what passes On earth, which caus'd your Glasses fate, I cannot to your Grace relate: Thus much, your Glasses all are broke, Too brittle to endure the stroke Come from the Earths side; likewise they That did the fact are fled away. Quoth Jove, (&amp; frowning, bit his tong) The villain shall repent this wrong, Could I but know him. Momus cry'd, Surely you are all heavie ey'd; (And with that mirth he's always in) 'Tis nothing but a blow with Pin. Quoth angry Jupiter, Buffoon, Leave fooling, or repent it soon: Is this a time to carp and jest, When Mortals dare the Gods molest? If you'd have heels be kept from fetters, Be mute in presence of your betters No more of that; but now I'll know What mortal there can be below, Durst in this manner break my rest, Or hatch such treason in his brest? Are not the heavens Ninepin-proof? I swear by Pegasus his hoof, I'll be reveng'd of Pins and Bowl. Quoth Pallas, Sir, upon my soul There's not a Glass left whole: Mon Dieu, The Gods themselves must drink in shoe. Thus each day does create new pranks; Mortals (for mirth) deserve our thanks. The thanks return'd shall as Rue (bitter) Be unto all, quoth Jupiter: If straight I put not Rods in piss For them, they will do worse then this: By Pluto, my revenge shall flie (As th' injury, and I am) high. As Jove was venting thus his spleen, Sol enters with his wearied Teem, And hearing Jove make such a clatter, Said to the next, Pray what's the matter? Straight did Silenus tell him what Befel them all, and what had not. Says Sol to Jove, I'll tell you, Sir, For I saw all that caus'd this stir. Be brief, quoth Jove, (and omit nothing) Because prolixity is loathing. Sol having briefly laid the state Of dreadful Typhons acts of late; Quoth Jove, A word to th'wise: now stay, I will that straight, without delay, God-Mercury descend to th' earth; His message 'tis must spoil their mirth: Let him shew Typhon his mistake, Who thinks of Jove an Ass to make; Tell him, his Gyant-like retinue, Nor all the stock of their Revenue, Shall hinder justice: they shall know, Whether 'tis I, am Jove or no. Be sure you do your Message well, In State and Order; to them tell Their own. Mercury having heard The Embassie, he stroakt his beard, (Or Chin in lieu) saluted hand, And scrap'd a leg: I understand (Quoth he) my duty, and the strife. With that he 'gins to handle Knife, Or Sword, which girting on his side, Doth next his Snakie Staff provide: Slips on his winged shooes, on's head He clapt his feather'd Cap, and fled As fast as wings could bear him down, O'er River, Citie, Wood and Town. At last he came unto the place Where Typhon and his Gyant-race (Some standing, others sate on Crupper) Were just providing for their Supper: Of what the Supper did consist, See here a true and perfect List. An hundred lustie Oxen slain, Which they had stole by might and main From Herds-men; Sheep some four times more, Got by the means as said before, Which Cacus a notorious knave, Had stole by night, and hid in Cave: 'Twas he that thought he once could beat (And fought with) Hercules the Great; But lost his Kingdom, and at length His life, by Hercules his strength. This Cacus did in Carthage raign; At length in Italy was slain. There leave we him, and fall to Mutton, As good as ever knife was put on. Their Sheep they roasted whole on Trees, Instead of Spits, and that with ease: Trees that for length, &amp; strength, &amp; barks, Bore Sheep as little Spits do Larks. The rank beneath was less; the last, About the smalness of a Mast. Their fire a Forest was, which they Design'd before for that same day. They thus prepar'd, in came the God, Who crying, Humh! and giving nod, Began his brief and formal story, And they to round him tory-rory. Quoth one of them, Whoop holiday! 'Tis very true, what do you say? Then quoth another, with disdain, The God is out, begin again. I tell you once more, that great Jove (Quoth Mercury) who rules above, Has sent me here, to let you know He rules (as well as there) below; And were you bigger then you are Ten times, yet he is higher far: Your men are Rogues, &amp; women Whores, And he's resolv'd to pay your scores: His threats are chiefly to you, Typhon, For having lewdly spun your life on, He sendeth word you are a Knave, A Thief, a Cheat, a Rascal, Slave; And does command that straight you go And buy him Glasses: doing so, If they be Venice, number cent, His choler may no farther vent. Then, with acknowledgement of blame, Present to Jupiter the same; And let him (with submission) know, 'Tis your request to kiss his toe: Be ready too, without a halt, To cry Peccavi for your fault: Then if you adde, 'Tis past and gone, And never shall the like be done; This contest may not onely end, But Jupiter will be your friend. The Gyants hearing this discourse, With stomacks big as that of horse Began with scorn to laugh and scoff. The God in studie to get off, As being fearful. Typhon then: Though you are Gods, and we but Men, (Quoth he) yet know, for I'll be plain, If you a quarrel will maintain, And that with neither fear nor wit; Tell Jove, I hold no answer fit, But this: We will not purchase Glasses For him, nor his celestial Asses: Let him send Ganimed, that elf, Or take the pains to go himself. The nimble God before in plight, Was now enraged at this flight; In milde expressions gave a threat, But durst not any more repeat: For Gyants valu'd Gods no more Then Swine do Pearl, or costly Ore. But Mercury, more knave then fool, Put up (as Proverb faith) his Tool; And instantly he took his flight, Till gotten clearly out of sight. We'll now suppose h'as reacht his home, And unto Jupiter is come: For he had flown with greater speed Then I can write, or you can read. The Gods themselves that hourly move In highest orbs, can drink and love; And so did Jove, who scorn'd to shrink, Whilst heart to love, or mouth to drink: He drank so much that very day, That all his Sense was fled away; And Mercury concealed Tale, Till Jove had slept away his Ale. CANTO II. The Argument. The nimble God from heaven sent Returns with Gyants Complement: At which the Gods begin to tremble, And straight a Parliament assemble; Who for preventing future harms, Consult on manner of their Arms: Debating long, it is decreed That Vulcan fall to work with speed. Jupiter's Mistress, red as Rose, Was dropping dew from eyes or nose; 'Tis all a case: for drops are drops, Come they from eyes, or nose, or chops. Her grief occasion'd by a fly-blow, Yclep'd by knowing ones, a by-blow: Calisto 'twas, Diana's Maid, Whom Jupiter to lust betraid. Gods are (like mortals) dull &amp; stupid, When once they're subject unto Cupid: If there's brutality in Men, Or Gods, it must be chiefly then. Yet strange to think, the Gods should do What Men abhor, and blush at too: But Gods and Men in folly move, When captiv'd by the power of love. When Mercury arose from sleep, 'Twas then he saw Calisto weep. Have you not in a Chimney seen A sullen Faggot moist and green; How slowly it admits of heat, And does not onely weep, but sweat? So fares an unexperienc'd Virgin, When Jupiter himself is urging: But dry-wood-like, the practick Dame Cracks, and rejoyces at the flame. Quoth Mercury, If thus you grieve, I must do so, or must not live: O let me know your cause of sorrow. But rising up, quoth she, Good-morrow. So parted Mercury and her. At length he came to Jupiter, Right early, for avoiding blame; And him he found in bed with Dame, Who being sensible of wrong She had receiv'd, was using tongue: For Jupiter had often stunk With drink, when home returning drunk: Her help still nothing but condoling, Whilst he abroad was Caterwoling: For this same little fault he had, Sometimes he would a Whoring gad; In other matters none more civil, (For there are dues belong to devil) And to speak truth, no equal there is To him in Lombardy or Paris; Nor can the like of him be found All over the Utopian ground. God Mercury was loth to venter At first, but by and by did enter, Just as he heard the Goddess say, What shall that Maiden do, I pray? What mad-man do you think will take her Now you have plow'd upon her Acre? Jove seeing Mercury appear, As one most glad to see him there, Without his Slippers or his Hose, To rise he does himself dispose; And straightway gives the God command To let him clearly understand The cause o'th' late and sudden action, What Typhon says for satisfaction; Or if the mortals dar'd to own Th'abuses they of late had done. (Great Jove) quoth Mercury, I'll tell What during my abode befel Since I descended from the skie, (And hang me if I tell a lie) Though 'twas my study to dehort all, They cry'd, The Gods like us are mortal: And if in strength did lie the odds, Then they themselves would all be Gods. Quoth they, This carry to your Jove; Nor threats, nor he himself shall move Us to excuse whatever Fate By our directions did of late. Then howl'd they as if they were mad: I fearing their intentions bad, And that in this their dreadful ire They'd synge my wings with flames of fire, Did sneak away. They seeing that, Cry'd out, Halloo, a Rat, a Rat; Hold him there. I, in this sad plight, Had almost lost my ears and sight: For, what with smoak of fire, and noise, I hardly saw, or heard I voice But what was most confus'd: I'm sure, I understand thus much, endure Such an affront? 'tis leud and base; We'll geld the rogue upon the place. At this their rudeness, wonder not If by agility I got Away. Here Jove commanded son Forbear: Enough, quoth he, ha' don: Go, get your breakfast, then in haste Summon the Gods; let no time waste: Be diligent to let them know I'd have their counsels 'gainst the foe. Jove wisely thought few words were best, Kept his intentions in his brest; Onely he frown'd, and then he swore; Said little, though he thought the more. Typhon the while, we may agree, Did swear and rant as fast as he: This news report did straight afford, Typhon would come with fire and sword, With him the stout Encelades, With divers others great as these. That Gyant Mimas fierce and proud, Stood up, and spake his thoughts aloud; He curs'd the Gods, and in his tale Said much, that did as much prevail With Typhon's humour: quoth he, Now We all must make a solemn Vow To be reveng'd of this same Jove, That threatens Thunder from above: Be you as me, and I as you, We'll finde him work enough to do. What if he doth somtimes with Thunder Rend Steeples, Tow'rs, &amp; Rocks a sunder? Cannot we do the same, or can He that which can't be done by man? If we unite, by strength of arm, Our valour shall outdo a Charm. Couragious friends, what need we fear? I'll pluck him from his stately Chayr By th' beard, and thereby hurl him round, Until his length upon the ground Be measur'd: then I'll set in flames His Starry house, and make his Dames Or Goddesses from that time prove The strength of me, and fate of Jove: Nay, Venus, Pallas, Juno proud, I'll get with bearn in softest cloud. What if the Titans they did rout? 'Twas not because the Gods were stout; It was a pannick fear possest The Titans; they in thought possest, At first gave way, anon they run: So by their folly were undone: From thence we must derive the date Of Star-cross Tytan's rigid fate: A meer Goat-skin affrighted so, They ran without or stroak or blow, As if they met (as people say) Not to engage, but run away. Those of them that appeared stout, Were forc'd to do as did the rout; And good shift too, for by Orlando, A man can do but what he can do. But we'll be like our selves: now see Which of you all will follow me: For he that dares in field to die, Does in the bed of Honour lie: Nor can those Heroes once be dead, But sleep, when laid in Honours bed. Typhon with gladness hearing this, Said to the rest, It were amiss Long to defer their punishment. Quoth Mimas then, By your consent Let us all laugh, rant, tear the ground, So loud, that they may hear the sound On high, the place where they reside; The noise will somwhat quell their pride: A Match, then cry'd Porphyrion, Who soon was answer'd by Thoon. This Thoon was of Trojan birth, And by Ulysses kill'd to earth. Then joyntly they began to Hollow; The chief among them were as follow: Great Ephialtes, Neptune's son, He who the attribute had won Of Gyant huge, for strength and hew; For he nine inches monthly grew: Japet, Pelor, Celadon, Athos, Damasor, Gration, Cycaon, Clytius, Echion, Pollibotes, Laomedon, Pallenus, and Alcyoneus, Almops, Cynus, and Besbeus, Briareus, Ceractus, and Clius, Anteus, Ascus, Titius, Numantia, Gyas, Bergion, Pallas, Lapetus, and Albion, Lyncus, Buricus, Coeus, Argyropes,and Aloeus, Euritus, Agrius; with these, The King of Thrace, Diomedes: They all at once did howl and roar, Made thousand antick tricks and more; And on a sudden they did bawl, A Typhon, Typhon, one and all. Whilst thus they did conspire below, Jove in the clouds ran to and fro, Banning and cursing Carman-like, Commands that neither Gun, nor Pike, Sword, Halbert, Headpiece, Back or Brest, Be wanting in each quarter; rest Abandons: thus he threatens wonders, Which shortly he'd perform by Thunders; Commandeth Mercury prepare Some Exhalations fine and rare; Use skill and art, but no remorse; Get them by fair means or by force. The speedy God in haste did run, And told his Message to the Sun; Who answer'd, he had no such trash But what required ready Cash. The little God assur'd him then, If trust, he should be paid agen. At length quoth Sol, Come, let me see, I seldom deal with friends like thee: Tell Jove, I'll furnish him with store; And if he wants, he shall have more. Mercury breaking air in haste, Soon reacht his place forsaken last; There found he all the Gods assembled, Some stunk for fear, and others trembled (At these fell Gyants impudence) A third sort had nor wit nor sense. As soon as Mercury they spy'd, Before, behinde, on every side They flockt about him, to enquire What arms, what men, and what attire The Gyants us'd against their foes. Quoth Mercury, There's none but knows As much as I: for can you think That I, that forced was to wink That little time I tarry'd there, Could learn so much as one affair Of what you have so lately spoke? But I presume they fight with smoke: For I so thorowly was fill'd With fumes, that fearing to be kill'd, I gladly scap'd away. The Gods, By sighs, by symptoms, and by nods, Exprest their careful zeal: for when Gyants are more then meerly men, And threaten to do more then elves, The Gods should seem above themselves. Now by unanimous consent, They straightway call'd a Parliament. Down do they all in order sit, (Not by their Honestie or Wit, But) as in Honour they excel, Their method was exactly well. As for Example, God of Seas Took place of him was God of Pease Or Gardens; and the God of Wine Preceded this, be'ng of the Line And Royal Bloud of mighty Jove, (Reasons strong enough to move) To them came Jupiter, with Crown On's head, on back Skie-colour'd Gown, With Cupid bearing up his Train, For fear of rents, or spots, or stain; Neatly comb'd and curl'd his hair; In's hand a Thunder-bolt he bare, But not so big as them he throws From high, t'exterminate his foes: It was a Pocket-Thunderbolt, Scarce big enough to kill a Colt Not three days old; onely to shew What Jupiter had pow'r to do: And some there are which do presume 'Twas fill'd &amp; stuff'd with sweet Perfume. Next unto him, with visage milde, Old Time came creeping as a childe; Weary'd, upon his Sythe he leant, With coming thither almost spent: He plac'd himself within a Chayr Next his own son, that he might hear The better. Age had struck him blinde, Or deaf, the truth I cannot finde. Nor is't material. Pallas then, (Who something knew belong'd to men) At first sate down; but lifting breech From seat, she thus deliver'd speech: Ye Gods, we're here together met; What then remains, but that we set In Council how to manage Wars With Gyants that occasion Jars? Thus said, the Hector Mars stood up, (And he it seems had got a Cup Too much) he ratled Oaths so loud, They crackt like Thunder in a cloud: Quoth he, Away with all this noise; I'll bring you Typhon and his boys My self: the Gods would honour those Too much, should they appear as foes: Their weapons and themselves I scorn; Who dares not die, should not be born. Quoth Jove, By all the Gods of Greece, I'll make that Rascal hold his peace: Thou Flash, 'twas Neptune's turn to speak. Mars hearing this, began to sneak; Sat down as quiet as a Lamb, But in his heart did curse and damn. Jove's brother having hauk'd and hum'd I mean old Neptune cold land num'd, And having spit a pool of Fleam, That stuck in's throat, &amp; spoil'd his theam When put off hat, and made a bow, He would have spoke, but knew not how The Gods, that like himself were sage, However, did respect his age, Advis'd him cover head with hat, For fear of cold: so down he sat, Adjudging it more meet to sit, Then standing up to cough and spit Among the Gods, who not a few, Were thereby almost like to spew. Then Bacchus who was sitting by, And laughing till he seem'd to cry, Took Handkerchief, and wiping eyes, Impos'd a silence in the skies: But having drank his mornings dose, Quoth he, In spight of Typhon's nose, I'll an Imbargo lay on Wine; Nor shall it be consum'd by Swine: For such these Gyants are; if then They want good Wine, like other men They will appear; they're now the high'r By help of Grape that does inspire. The Gods themselves are but as Specter, (So Men) if not refresht by Nectar. If they continue drinking Wine, Or feed upon Westphalia-swine, Mushrooms, Shallots, Anchoves, and The chiefest dainties of the Land: So long as they shall have no lack Of Sherry, Malago, and Sack; They'll drink until they are as drunk As they that fight for Madam Punk: They'l call us rogues, &amp; whores &amp; Panders, And those are excellent Mænders Wherein (if Gyants are not watcht, The Gods may suddenly be catcht. Thus Bacchus having gravely spoke, Momus, that even then awoke, (For he before had slept) stood up, Quoth he, Give Bacchus t'other cup: He that speaks sense deserves to drink; Fill him some Nectar to the brink: He spake sense now, but drank before; Give him some drink, he'll utter more: It should be (Ganimede) your part To be provided with a Quart For whoso wants. Thus went he on, Till Jove cry'd out, No more, ha' done, You carping Knave; or if you'll not, I'll mince you small as herbs in pot: Or if you drop a word i' th' way, When any here hath ought to say: This is no more a place for laughing, Then for untimely talk, or quaffing. For all these checks, you may believe The Knave laught at him in his sleeve. Then quoth Salasia, Neptune's wife, This Momus does delight in strife. More she'd have said, when Vulcan came Limping to Jove, (for he was lame) And Blacksmith-like, without a Band, By'r leave, quoth he, with Cap in hand: Great Sir, I judge we ought to shew What dutie you may claim as due: Yet if you have your eye or ear From Momus, he doth laugh and jear. Then Jupiter I know it well, He's such another fiend of hell: Nor he, nor any of his Race, Were ever worth a Fiddle-case. But 'tis no matter: pray retire, And tell us, thou great God of Fire, The means to quell these Gyant-dogs. Let me alone to forge out Clogs, Quoth Vulcan: but I'll tell you, Sirs, The best defence against the Curs Is to bar up your windows all With iron Grates, and raise your wall: I'll forge them out so strong, you'll say, The workman merits double pay: They shall defend with so much ease, Heav'n needs no other bars then these. The thing requires some haste, I trow; Straight to my Cyclops will I go, And cause them beat with strength of arm Bars to protect the Gods from harm. So fare you well. 'Twas Momus now, That next with tongue began to plow: For 'tis to him as Cash and Diet To talk, and poison to be quiet. Quoth he, 'Tis foolish; Gyants are So tall, they'll reach to iron bar, There fix a hold, by that means get Perhaps to place where now we sit: For if they once get hold of Grate, They'll quickly burst a room for pate; And if the head does enter hollow, The body certainly will follow: Now let them use their utmost skill, They can't get in, so hugely ill Their holding is; for Gyant proud Has nothing to embrace but cloud. Quoth Jupiter, I pray give o'er; We have consider'd this before: What you say we'll prevent with Guard Shall watch from time the Gods are barr'd; And they conclude it must be Iron That shall the Deities environ. Thus having said, they all agree To stand or fall by Jove's decree. By this time night came on, and they Adjourn'd to th' next approaching day: For sitting all this while on Crupper, From morning till the time of Supper, They weary'd were; but now they come As fast as legs could carry bum: One party takes his way to Tavern, Others dispose themselves for Cavern; But he that made himself a guest, However hasted to his rest. CANTO III. The Argument. The Gyants give the first Alarm With ill success: again they arm, Renew a second time the fight With like success, are put to flight. Back they return, and gain the odds; They rout, and they pursue the Gods, Who cunningly do vary shape In Wood, the better to escape. The news of Gyants war is hot: Some say they'l fight, &amp; some say not: But Gods and Gyants do intend By War to seek each others end. The Gyants think it better far, Then be as meerly Gyants are: For if of Jove they gain the odds By conquest, they shall all be Gods. Jove likewise summons Exhalations, With other warlike preparations: With these (as in a trice) he tries To plant defences for the skies. The Gyants being told by Scout, (For such went hourly in and out) They silently without bravado, Consult to stop the Barricado. For things of such a nature sprung, Want action rather then a tongue. So having labour'd all that night, Without or noise, or use of light, Encelades the Gyant bold At first attempt almost got hold Of window small, &amp; thought with chains To make a bridge should answer pains, By which according to his will, With ease he'd tumble hill on hill. Now by great chance, as Jove would ha't, He having got a worm in pate, While other of the Gods were sleeping, Had near-hand dearly paid for peeping: For standing high upon a Cricket, With hand he open'd heaven-Wicket; Encelades began to run: Ods waouns, quoth Jove, we're all undone. Both were amaz'd; but Gyant pist A mighty river ere he list Look back: then seeing Jove to nod; Let Jove be ne'er so much a God, Quoth he, I'll to him, and relate, As Prophet, his prodigious fate. But Jove was not so much a fool, To stay when Gyant put up tool: For you may think, 'twould stir his bloud To see the Gyant piss a floud, And then return with courage new. Jove knowing better what to do, Wisely clapt to the Wicket, and Cry'd to the Gyant, Prethee stand, And cool thy heels. With this his voice Juno awoke, and hearing noise, Came running: she for haste had spread An old blue Apron on her head; And on her breech, in stead of coat, A thredbare Cloak not worth a groat: 'Twas Ganimed's; but I shall spare To shew its cause of being there. Juno through cranny did espy Encelades was standing by; And judging fit, (as she had reason) Extended mouth to utter Treason; And she was not of chops so small, But that she could full loudly baul. Two of the Gods with sword in hand Rusht headlong in: the one cry'd, Stand. Jove mean while keeps a heavie pother: Some Powder here, the rogues to smother; My Thunder-bolt, my Match, my Flask: Now come, you dogs, I'll set a task, Quoth he; and instantly doth catch Up Powder, Thunder-bolt, and Match: No noise, quoth he, of Pipe and Drum; Finger on nose, and crying Mum: He fits his tackling; then quoth he, What Jove can do, you straight shall see: With that, unto the window goes, Opes it, and stands upon his toes, Thunder in hand, and strutting now, As in the gutter does the Crow. But Fate had almost done its worst: For whenas Jupiter did burst The Wicket open second time, Encelades did upward climb; For he had piled stones below, Whereon he stood: and it was now, As soon as Jove had gotten thither, Encelades with quill or feather So brusht the God upon the eye, That he cry'd out, I die, I die: For you may note, the quill was big, Or Jove would not have car'd a fig: Besides, with stroak, upon the ground Was cast, and thereby fear'd a wound: But as it hapt, the greatest hurt Was onely that he fell in durt. Jove was no sooner on his back, But all the rest amazed pack: 'Twas wisdom to secure their lives, (And they must go, the devil drives.) Jove seeing all were fled away, Got up, and ran as fast as they: And well he scap'd; for what says Pluck? The greater Knave, the better luck. The Wicket was (it seems) so small, That Gyant had no room to crawl: Which Jove perceived (being gone) As far as we may cast a stone: And if from thence he had not seen Encelades to stick between, As Ram that is trappan'd in thicket, Jove never had return'd to Wicket: For at that time, one silly elf Might beat a God or two himself, Their fear amaz'd them so. But when Great Jove returned back agen, Encelades the Gyant saw 'Twas time and wisdom to withdraw; And so he did, with much ado: But Lord, the rubbish that they threw On's head, when he was gotten down! And after they had Piss-pots thrown, Went heaps of stones to further slaughter, And Kettles too of scalding water. This made the Gyant quit his place To Mimas, one of Loobie-race, Who loving mischief with his heart, Most ready was to take his part: And th'other Gods on noise of summon, Forsaking beds, in clusters come on; Some so possest with Leaden sleep And terrour, that they seem'd to peep Through the thin curtains of their eyes. Immediately the Gods advise: The number now grown great, 'twas hard You'll say, if Jove should want a guard; Nor did he: for when Gyant rascal Came, quoth Jove, My friends, I ask all, Will ye agree to fight? for why? You have your choice, or fight, or die: My resolution is to force on, Beyond the angry strength of Orson: But they as Gods made this resolve, Whatever dangers do involve, We'll follow thee; nor will we spare In thy behalf to do and dare. With that, Jove taking heart-a-grace, Pluckt Thunderbolt from out of case, And having prim'd and cockt the same, Now then, quoth he, begins the game. By this time Mimas (almost enter'd) Surprized Jove, who forthwith ventur'd, Discharging of his Thunder-gun, (The biggest ever seen by Sun.) No sooner had the Powder took, But instantly a mighty nook From Gyant Mimas monstrous snout Flew off; which grieved him, no doubt. But hold, methinks I hear it sed, Could Gyant Mimas get in head And body too, when as the other Could not, with all his art and pother? For information, you may conster Encelades the greater Monster: I have consulted those that know, And have maintain'd it with a Vow, Mimas was much the lesser man, By furlongs three, and half a span. When Mimas did perceive his treat, He fear'd his dangers might be great: As Proverb faith, his judgement saw, Necessity has little Law. Out did he get more fast then in: 'Tis true, he left behinde his chin; What then? 'tis better when in strife, To lose a chin, then forfeit life. 'Twas now, when Gods perceived this, That they unanimously hiss; Call'd Gyant coward, frown'd, and strut, As Cocks o'th' game within a Hut: Their uproar was so hugely lowd, That other Deities do crowd; From divers parts they're seen to run, This with a Pitchfork, that with Gun, Another with a Spit, a fourth Perhaps with weapon lesser worth: For when they heard the noise command, Each seiz'd on what came next to hand. The jolly troop in this disguise Marcht on, commanded by the wise And skilful Pallas: never troop More like to make the Gyants stoop. Jove having spied this recruit, Quoth he, Let's follow in pursuit; And crying, All's our own, my boys; Lay down (continu'd he) these toys, Take each of you a well-made sword, 'Twill serve the turn, I'll pass my word. With that, Jove on his Eagle strides; Swift as the Bird could move, he rides After the Rebels, at which time Each God does to the window climb, Ambitious in their heat of love, Which should be neerest unto Jove. Thus they press on, the Gyants run; The Gods would fight, the Gyants shun; The Gods pursue, the Gyants flie; The Gods prevail, the Gyants die. But as some wiser are then some, Jove order gave, that sound of Drum Should rally forces; thinking fit, That being weary'd, they should sit And breathe a while. At which God Mars Incensed, cry'd, If us'd to Wars, Or knew of Victory the gain, You'd surely blush when you complain: Not to pursue them and their fate, May make our selves unfortunate: Let's on; for having won the field, Not to persist, is half to yield: And how can we our prize maintain, Unless we do augment our gain? Ods nigs, see how the raskals sneak. Silence, quoth Jove, that I may speak: You see them there; I'll lay my life, Ere it be night I'll end the strife My self: however, follow me; Keep close, and you'll the better see: Although the Sun is scorching hot, And I both Powder want and Shot, I will so cool the rebels courage, You shall have room enough to forrage: They boast they'll rob us of our lives, Plunder our wealth, enjoy our wives; Now may they come, if they think good: I feel a fire within my bloud, Which must be quencht. The Gyants now Rally afresh in Battel-row: Encelades appear'd i'th' front: Quoth angry Mars, Now fie upon't, Delays are dangerous; I'll go, And fight, before they rally so. Great Mars he had no sooner done, But spy'd Encelades to run, As if he did intend to say, I am in haste to win the day. Mars does prepare to entertain This Gyant and his Bumkin-train: They meet; but that is not so strange, As were the blows that they exchange: They hack and hew behinde, before, Till both were little else but gore. Encelades the Monster bold Was almost spent, when Mars cry'd, Hold: So both contended for the field, And either willing was to yield: At last quoth Mars, If you or I Should now in this encounter die, 'Twere ill: whose valour does persever, Deservedly should live for ever. With that, both being weary grown, They stop, and cast their weapons down; Salute each other, and retire, Not to engage, but to admire: For there were others that could fight, Gods and Gyants too of might; Blows freely fell on either side; Here lay a broken scull, a hide Lies there, in third place leg or arm: Deities were no more a Charm 'Gainst Gyants, then the others oddes In stature was against the Gods. But Oh the dreadful noise was made With Thunder, Powder, Flask and Blade! Pan from the Sea had borrow'd shell, Whose sound was loud as that of bell When struck upon. Nor was Jove heard To thunder when he syng'd the beard Of Gyant Mimas, who was struck Not long before, and cursing luck, As he upon the ground did lie, It fortun'd that he cast his eye (As it took liberty to wander) On Pallas, son to great Evander. This Pallas did so far engage Among the Gods, that they in rage Surrounded him; but Mimas rose, And with such courage dealt his blows, That he at once brought Pallas off, And on the Gods revenged scoff Which Jove did to him, when by thunder He parted chin and chaps asunder: At which disaster, boyling hot His bloud was waxt, and he had got In's hand an implement of War, By some ycleped Iron Bar; With this, God Mercury he strook, That down he fell; and then he took The rising blow with such a force, Grim death it self was little worse. Just now the Goddess Pallas came; (For there were two that bore the name) She with the weapon that is common With Goddess as it is with Woman, Exclaim'd on Gyant: he to reach The full proportion of her breech, Erected lofty foot so high, That down he fell: there let him lie. For Bacchus some had called bastard, Enflam'd beyond the rage of dastard, In did he rush, and made such pother, That Gyants fell on one another. Some that were present did divine His valour did proceed from Wine: Howe'er it was, he did excel All but those few that did as well. Silenus drunk as David's Sow, Spurring his ass on, cry'd, Now, now; Ride over Mimas there in blood: But that did him more harm then good; For Mimas who was laid to rest, Rose up, and seiz'd upon the beast: Then to Silenus said, I gather You should be that same Bacchus's father: With that, he smote him on the head, That down he fell ('twas thought) for dead. But wonders now I mean to tell; For thus to Gyants it befel: Whilst all the Warriors were in fight, Each studious to declare his might, The silly Ass began to bray, And Gyants fairly ran away: For they not us'd unto the sound, First swore, then swiftly quit the ground: The Gods pursue with might and main, But all their haste and speed was vain; For what with fighting, and the toyl Of thus pursuing after spoil, Weary'd, they do conclude it fit On grass or somwhat else to fit. No sooner were they seated than A Foot-man came, and thus began: By'r leave; I from old Saturn come, To tell you he has learn'd in Rome Some while since of a Cunning man Gyants shall still survive; nor can The Gods prevent it, (this you'll finde, Or else say he's a Prophet blinde) Until by search somewhere on earth, You finde a Knight of humane birth, Got on a mortal, by the seed Of one that's of immortal breed. Besides, he bade me tell you more, One Proteus said as much before; And this same fellow knew his art So well, he'd instantly impart A secret, whether wise or silly, Soon, or as learnedly as Lilly. As for Example, thus it was; Base thief one morning stole from Lass A Bodkin and a Silver-Spoon: The man was took, and hang'd by noon; But all was by his art: for he Discover'd where the thief could be. Dixi, quoth Footman: Jove with that Commanded he should don his hat, And rest himself, whilst he doth muse, Reflexions making on the news: They Bacchus and Minerva call, Old Neptune, Mercury, and all The Gods that then were nigh at hand: Quoth Jove, You are to understand— Then he began the tale again; And leaning o'er the Asses Main, Quoth he, Let's think what must be done. Pallas reply'd, You have a son Nam'd Hercules; 'tis fit you dub Him Knight of the Majestick Club; And in requital, he alone Will slay the Rascals. Ev'ry one, By voice, or holding up of paws, Gave Pallas her deserv'd applause: Some cry, Defer no longer, send; Others, Our time too fast does spend; And we may finde, perhaps too late, The danger to procrastinate: Send Mercury. But Jove forbad; He'd rather send the Irish Lad That brought the news but now. With that The nimble Tory dofft his hat, Which shew'd his readiness, to Jove, Who promis'd to requite his love. The Lad rejoycing be was sent, Drank onely Usquebah, and went. No sooner was the Footman gone, (The Gods carousing) but anon In haste returns a careful Spie, Cries, Arms, the Gyants drawing nigh: The routed ones that ran so fast Before, met Typhon: he at last Perswaded them to face about, With promise of a total rout To all your Godships. Then quoth Jove, You talk of routing, pray for Love- Sake, tell me what 'twas made them run. Silenus's ass (Sir) sure as Gun, (Quoth Bacchus) with his noise did fright Philistins fierce from heat of fight. Jove then reply'd, He merits much; Would we had many asses such: I'd give a pound for mine own part. If all of you did know the art; Or if but one that might excel, Could play the Ass but half so well. Jove call'd Silenus then, cry'd, Hark, Came he from Smithfield, or Hyde-park? Silenus answer did extend, 'Twas sent as Token from a friend: But if (great Jove) it be your will, My Ass shall be your servant still. Jove forc'd a smile at that: for yet When laughing, he could not forget Dangers that were so neer him; though He thus discours'd, he thought of foe. Then mad that's Gun did not suffize The Gyants pride to civilize, In dumps he sate, as if he'd got A smack too much of Cup or Pot. O' th' sudden now a fearful noise Approacht: 'twas Typhon and his boys: Which when the Gods perceive, they call, Heavens have mercy on us all: And well they might; for had you seen The rabble with their swords so keen; Big Gyant with his hundred heads, And those how monstrously he spreads; You surely would with me conclude, Such foes were dreadful, fierce and rude. By this time both the Armies meet, And Typhon thus began to greet The Gods: Where's he that does command This Host? we'd have him understand, We hold our selves agriev'd, and now Bound to our selves by solemn Vow, Resolve, before we part, to have Or satisfaction, or a grave. In's hand he held a stately Oak. Jove, that he might prevent a stroak, Well thinking 'twas no time to think, Fills his great Thunder to the brink, Then throws it at the Gyants head; However, Typhon is not dead, But eying Jove with scorn and smile, Coughing and sneezing for a while, (Because some Powder, I suppose, Had flown upon his face and nose.) Thunder when from an angry cloud In its extreams, was not so loud As Gyants Oaths: he stampt and swore, As if the Gods were to be tore With words: then lifting mighty tree, 'Tis thus, base Jove, I'll answer thee, Quoth Typhon; and with that he flew As Furies may be thought to do. God Mars, who boldly rusht on foes, Receiv'd a fillip on the nose; 'Twas given by an angry Gyant, (For why should I tell you a ly on't?) And tumbled backwards on the ground The God of Hectors in a swound. This daunted all the other Gods: The Victors do pursue their oddes. Mars does revive and run: great Jove On Eagles back began to move: Minerva from the skirmish steals, So light was she about the heels. In one word, all the Gods did run, As if the Devil upon Dun Was at their posterns. But O curse, Then evil luck what can be worse? Whilst Jove with expedition flies, The Bird slips from between his thighs: Down drops great Jove upon the ground; But as it hapt, scap't hurt or wound. Typhon, whose sole delight was plunder, (Commanding Gyants to a wonder) Fell on the Booty and the Wine: These Prizes now (quoth he) are mine. Then resting after Chase and Slaughter, Drank Wine in full bowls fine water: Then with a stately step and stride, Continues quest of Jove and Bride, With all the rest o'ch' wandring Gods, Frighted as children are at rods; They shelter seek in pathless Wood: (That shift at need was hugely good) For being there in place obscure, A Metamorphosis in ure They put; and (if it be no flam) Jove chang'd himself into a Ram; Dame Juno lookt like any Cow, And deigned to the grass to bow; Neptune assum'd the shape of Hound; Momus a Jack-a-napes was found; Apollo wisely acts the Rook; Bacchus a he-Goat; Vulcan crook- Ed back and hips, a silly Calf; Pan was a Rat more big by half Then little Dog; and Venus Dame, A lovely milk-white Goat became: The warlike Mars chose for his share, To be transform'd into a Hare: His Valour sped so ill, 'twas meet To learn the swiftness of the Feet: Luna would not the Cat disdain, Nor Mercury the form of Crane. Thus Nature, that the Gods might scape, Contended was to play the Ape. Mean while the Gyants chase and scout, As Victors do when after Rout They seek for prey: but Gyants finde, Their sorrow is not far behinde; For meeting with the Gods, they prove, No foe more dreadful is then Jove. So true is that which Stories tell; Those that live ill, shall not die well. CANTO IV. The Argument. The Gods bethink it base to range In Woods, and now resolve to change Their borrow'd shapes: at Nylus-banks God Mercury performs his pranks: They cloath themselves,to Memphis go; The Priests and People kindness shew: Great Hercules they send for, who Attends them with no more ado. It was just now 'tween Dog and Bitch, Or Hawk &amp; Buzzard, (chuse you which) The Gods adventur'd out of Wood: For they behalves had understood Of Gyants course; and each had thought There was no danger to be caught: For from the biggest to the least, Each God was turn'd into a beast Or bird; their hazard nothing so, That they should stand in fear of foe. Gyants, although they oft pass by, Yet when a Ram or Goat they spie; In this same place an Hound, an Ape, A Cow, or beast of different shape; In other place a Rat, of nature (No matter which) for land or water; They little dream'd that there should lie In any beast a Deity. For who is he, that as he pass, Would once imagine Cow at grass Should be a God? The Gyants run With eagerness as they begun; Beset and search the wood, then finde There's nothing like a God; so blinde Was Gyants apprehension. Then The Gods that were secure from men Or Gyants, do consult a while In Council by the river Nyle; When in conclusion they agree To be as Gods were wont to be, Each to shake off his present shape: For since they clearly made escape, Why should great Jove in danger go Of injuring his feet or toe? For what with gravel, slime, and mud, (Which border'd on the neighbourfloud) Like sheep they forced are to slide, Or else with bare-foot to abide On stones: for Rams do never use To clad their feet with Boots or Shooes; Besides, so thick was Jove of Wooll, He fum'd and sweat like any Bull Whom angry dogs do put in fear. And Madam Juno, as I hear, A thorn had got within her toe, That did produce her mickle wo: But 'twas not Jove's nor Juno's grief Alone; but being they were chief O'th' company, I need not strain To shew how all the Gods complain. Jove thinking now 'twas time to speak, Made an Oration in the Greek To th' other Gods; and I thought good (Because it should be understood) To English it; and thus it follows: My friends, we've now escap'd the gallows (Thank Heaven for't) but what will say Succeeding ages, that we stray In these uncomely shapes? By this, The Gods will all become a hiss Or by-word: Gyants, if they know My Juno takes the form of Cow, They'll make her subject of their laughter To ages that shall be hereafter: Or when a God is seen, they'll say, Beware of horns, or Mutton, Ba. 'Tis better never to be born, Then so to live the mock and scorn Of ev'ry mortal. Jove (whose eyes Were wet before) now plainly cries; And I my self could almost borrow From other subjects of my sorrow A tear or two. But Natures course By this time spent, Jove did with force Proceed; and what he said were words To this effect: Though sticks and swords Are wanting, yet it would be worse, Should we be subject to the force Of Gyants: heaven thus contrives, They sha'n't be masters of our lives: We are not far from Memphis-town, Let's enter ere the Sun goes down; But first let Mercury make haste To change his shape, now danger's past: 'Twere well if he a Cloak could steal, (For being bare from head to heel) 'Twill be uncomely if he go Stark naked from the top to toe. When Mercury is clothed thus, I'd have him get some cloathes for us. The God most forward to reveal The stock he had of love and zeal For Jove, said nothing but Amen; Great Jove, it shall be done. And then No sooner said, but straight he flies In shape of Crane, till he espies Some Youngsters washing in a pool: The Crane (so like a harmless fool) Lights neer the cloathes, as almost tyr'd: The youths beheld, and all admir'd: A Crane! says one; let's make a match Immediately the Crane to catch: Done, says another. Thus they talk: The Crane mean time does bend his walk To th' cloathes, and by and by amain Cast off his borrow'd shape of Crane. So having done, he puts on dress. All were amazed, you may guess, Who saw this sudden transformation, More strange then ever was in nation. Mercury like a pretty lad, With all their cloathes begins to gad. The youths belike had learnt some Oaths; So swore the devil had their cloaths: But they all naked, knew not how To follow him; nor did they know What to imagine: but the God Made so much haste, that straight he trod To Usurer, and pawn'd a Pearl Of Juno's, or some other girl: The owner of it was some Lass; However, we may let that pass: The Pearl it was of value such, That he of Coyn procur'd as much As bought up habits of the best, For Jove, for Juno, and the rest; Then bought a lusty Mule to bear Unto the Gods his purchas'd ware: It was not long until he came, Redeeming all the Gods from shame, Each of them with an earnest motion, Measures habit with proportion. Mercury thus performing part; When done, quoth he, I know a tart- Wench lives hard by at signe of trumpet, Perhaps you'll take her for a strumpet; But be she what she will, 'tis meet We visit her to drink and eat. This course they all applaud as best; And Mercury, that was her guest Before, was order'd to repair Unto her, to bespeak the fare. Mercury flew, until he lit Just at the door, and then 'twas fit He close his wings, and walk: beside, He walkt not half a dozen stride Until he enters. Welcome, Sir, The Tapster cries. Then answers Mer- Cury, I would converse with Dame. Quoth fellow, May I crave your name? Then straight the Goodwife does appear: Quoth she, I pray, good Sir, draw neer; You're welcome. She was frying Tripe. The God then call'd for Pot and Pipe: Down do they sit: but Oh the bliss Was then in ev'ry glance and kiss, Whenas they talkt! for you may think, Their hearts were filled to the brink With joy: for Mercury was mannish; Soon he dispatcht his Pipe of Spanish; Then having in a Note set down What diet could be had in Town, The Maid was call'd, and Hostess sent her To buy o'th'best: and now does enter The rest o'th' Gods, a worthy troop; By turns, they ev'ry one do stoop To kiss the Hostess: Jove began; Then Neptune, Bacchus, Mars and Pan, And so the rest. When Juno saw her, In haste and anger calls the Drawer To bring some Wine: for she did grutch The goodwife should be buss'd so much, And she her self had none. Quoth Pan, Just now I to the Garden ran, Where there are most delightful bow'rs, And like for all the world to ours. Oh me! quoth Juno, let's go there; I love to have the smell of air. No sooner were they out, but all The town came flocking, great and small, To see the Troop: for they had heard An Army came, and were afeard. One cries, Alas, we shall be undon: Another says, They're blades of London; For that's a wilderness, we know, Where many such tall Cedars grow. Thus while they chat, a world appear: In time, the Cat does lick her ear. One bauls, What Gallants trow are these? Another answers, Hold your peace; They're Kings that usually are wont In numbers brave (as these) to hunt. Another whispers, How the Inne Smells sweet as 'twere of Benjamin! The next more wisely gives a ghess, They're Players. All of them express Their thoughts: but som were apt to think Players were not so full of Chink: But others thwart them, saying then, They're now the chiefest Gentlemen: Are they not clad in Plush and Sattin? And don't they sometimes visit Mattin? Do they not strut with Muff and Sword; Keep company with Knight and Lord? Let me not now forget to tell How Jove had sent where once did dwell The great Alcides: he that went, Was absent till eight days were spent. About that time, Jove casting eye From window, 'twas his chance to spie Alcides: straight down stayrs he runs, And clapping fist into his son's, How dost, quoth he, my bonny Lad? What, hast thou quite forgot thy Dad? 'Tis true, as ancient story goes, That childe is wise, nown father knows. Quoth Hercules, Oh, now I see You are the same; I, you are he. With that, the complements renew, And each does render devil due. Whilst they embrace, the other Gods Were almost 'mongst themselves at oddes Who first salutes Alcmena's son. By this, Jove's complements were done: With that, the Gods came all a-row To honour great Amphytrio: With tears in eyes they wept for joy, Meerly for sight of Jove's great boy. The strangers though the most were mutes When they observed these salutes, Flockt shrewdly: but when Jove they spi'd, (Who now had re-assum'd his pride) They great observance shew'd; for he (All saw) was chiefest in degree. But one amongst the rest, more bold Then his companions, cry'd out, Hold; Observ'd you him did just now nod? (The devil take me) he's a God: I know it by his garb and state, By his deportment, and his gate; His looks declare it: nay, (what's more) I have been told as much before. This News, as well as other things As strange, immediately took wings; So that in little space it came To their High-priest, a man of fame; Who hearing this, the truth to know, Resolves with company to go In person; and when there, to do His duty, if report held true That they were Gods: with him he brings For presents, fine Cornelian Rings Some thirty thousands; nineteen score Of Crocodiles new come to shore: Ichneumones, what beast is that? Some do suppose it Pharaoh's Rat; Of them threescore: Hippopotames, Or a Sea-horse, the more known name is, As tame as Pigeons; these a score: Of Eel-skin-gloves some ten times more. The high-priest come, the presents given, The crowd o' th' people further driven, Complements past on either part; Jove seem'd content, and glad at heart: The Priest makes offer of protection Within his Land, with great affection: Jove likewise does return him thanks, With promise to protect his banks From what doth usually harm; He'd give them a preventing Charm Against the strength of Creatures stature, Or venom of depraved nature: All this on free-cost. Mercury, That present was, could even cry, That Jove should not consider how Through earth and air he us'd to plow To serve the Gods both to and fro: Yet Jove as much and more did know; And for requital, bids him dance Afresh perhaps as far as France. Now Jove and Priest by this time sate On breech, their stories to relate: For being in an unknown clime, Not knowing how to spend their time, They will that each a passage tell Of what had formerly befel. When now it came to jocund Priest, (Most ready to oblige the rest; For he of all was much the lesser) He story told of predecessor: Silence he crav'd, and did prevail: Then thus began THE PARSONS TALE. A crafty man in Country-town, Had wife was of a comely brown, And lov'd by neighbour-Parson, who At vacant hours came there to woo. The husband knowing Parson Fulpit (Ycleped so) in fleshly Pulpit Was wont to preach, casts how to catch Them both; and thus contrives his watch Sweetheart, quoth he, my business says I must go travel seven days. Nay, quoth the wife, if so you do, Why may not I go travel too? Then, as was wont, came in the Parson; Spies Chair and Cushion, sets his arse-on. Quoth wife to Priest, My husband, Sir, Is taking journey. I infer, Then cry'd the Parson, he hath cause. The husband after making pause, (Which shew'd he was in minde perplext, That Priest should chuse his wife for text) He doth befit himself with speed; Gives kiss to wife, and mounts his steed. The Parson then, and wife, by joynt Consent, begin to handle point; Thought of a Chamber, went into't, As best befitting close dispute: What were the arguments befel, I make no doubt but you can tell. But one thing should not be forgotten, The Parsons principles were rotten; A Sceptick, or as Martial saith, A wanderer with waving faith; Fickle, when he swore he loved Beyond or Aretine or Ovid. But th' honest man, whose mind did burn, As he intended, made return; Sees wife and Parson both withdrawn; Peeps, and spies Priest in sleeves of Lawn, As he suppos'd, but 'twas his Shirt; Nor had he Girdle to begirt: But as in Country-town no watch Is us'd, so door had onely latch, Which having lifted up, he enters, And first upon his wife adventers: So having chid, and scorn'd, &amp; mockt her, Leaves her, and thus accosteth Doctor: Come now, Sir Leacher, you that stand With Shirt on back, and Cloaths in hand, Deliver habit, or at once This Penknife sharp shall off with stones. The Parson, who was sore affright, As doubting whether man or spright, Admir'd to see the husband come, Who just before was gone from home. But whether 'twas through fear or cold, It matters not, his hands unfold, And down apparel falls. The man That stood with knife in hand, began To lay them by: which having done, Cries, Parson, sure as mothers son, Thus naked without Cloathes or Crutch, You shall immediately to Church, And there do Penance thus in white. Quoth Parson (vowing By this light) I'd rather die: good neighbour chuse Some other Penance; I'll refuse Nothing that you'll impose, provided You will not see your friend derided. On that the husband makes behest To wife, to reach him key of Chest: With it doth straightway Chest unlock, And makes the Parson put in Cock; And having us'd an art to fasten Priest Cock-sure, he away doth hasten To Penknife which he hard by laid, That made the Parson sore afraid: He puts the knife in Parsons hand, And caus'd his wife by his command To fire the Chest: for you must know, On purpose it was fill'd with tow. The Chest of fire, both man and wife Leave Parson there with Cock and Knife; Run out of doors, and make a noise By crying Fire. That dreadful voice Rais'd all the Parish, and as Torch, Might guide them unto what did scorch The Parson: in they ran, but cry'd, Neighbours beware, we shall be fry'd; Or else if fire make house to fall, 'Twill surely be the death of all. The Parson, who had heard them coming, 'Twixt shame &amp; synging left his humming; Takes knife, and with a valiant slash Brings body off, but leaves poor Swash Amidst the angry flames to fry: Judge, did not Swash a Martyr die? He hanged was, and quarter'd too; And he was burnt: but I should do Much wrong to Parson and to Cocks, Should I maintain a Paradox. Just now a messenger brings word, Typhon did mean with fire and sword, With clubs, with staves, &amp; other weapon, Visit the Gods, and warfare keep-on; Sends thus to Jove, In spight of's nose, In heav'n he'd suddenly repose: To that same end, it was his will, Mountain should bear the weight of hill, Great Oss on Pelion should stand, That heaven might be toucht with hand. These News it seems were very true; For Typhon and his Gyant-crew Had ransackt wood throughout and round (But th'devil a God was to be found) And were come back to mighty hill, To Crane it up (by strength and skill) On th'other; and about threescore Of hills, but less then those before, Were got already on a heap. Then Jove, who fetcht a sigh most deep, Reply'd, We then will take our lot, But beat the Iron while it's hot: Though they are Gyants great and tall, Their clambring may produce a fall; And the event may make it plain, They're hastie onely to be slain: My son, we'll stop their course before Upon those hills they set up more: For if we all (ere they surmise) Fall on, we cannot miss the Prize. Hercules fingers itch to be In action. Th' other Gods, who see His courage, 'gin to banish fear; Take heart a-grace, and prick up ear. Quoth Hercules, My Club's a tongue, That can both speak, and right a wrong: Moreover, quoth the lofty Yonker, I scorn to go to fight, but conquer. Then up they get on legs again, Boldly to follow their Chieftain, Who leads them on through thick &amp; thin Sometimes up almost to the chin. I will not be so tedious as To give relation how it was With all the Gods, or any one; Or whether they had horse, or none, Or rode on Elephants or Camels; Whether they crost brooks, ponds or channels: We will suppose them now to be Arriv'd beneath a spreading tree, Resting themselves for half an hour, Not far from Gyant Typhon's Tow'r: That time expir'd, Jove rouzes up, Calls for some Wine, and drinks a Cup; Chuses a lustie Bolt of Thunder. (Did you but see it, you would wonder) Out of a Cart-load they had brought From Memphis, Bolts but newly wrought By Vulcan's own hand, therefore good. Hercules, who by's Daddy stood, Takes up his weapon, and by night They march, till they approached right Against the place where Typhon lay Asleep. Without the least delay, Jupiter primes his Bolt so great; From him the standers by retreat For fear of harm, and Jove himself Was wary to avoid that shelf By which so many had been split: For (in his anger) he had wit. No God, though young, or old in years, Should Thunder flie about his ears, But would be scar'd; and days of yore, Such thunder never saw before. Sometimes Jove holds it on the right; Then suddenly, as full of fright, He changes it unto the left: Then spying that the ground was cleft On which he stood, he fastens it Within the same: all being fit, He puts his March upon a Spire, His arm stretcht out, presenting fire; Looks t'other way, &amp; cries, Does't touch? Then puffs and sweats, his fears were such. But Hercules, who stood at distance With Club and Sword in hand, assistance Gives to his Daddy, in these words: Let's leave these guns, &amp; use our swords. Go to, you fool, quoth Jove, and tell Me, when I am aside, or well. With that, he stretches out once more His arm and Lintstock as before: How am I now, quoth Jove? Too low, Quoth Hercules; too high: so, so. Pish, quoth the touchhole; bounce, the gun: On th' earth both father and the son Lie sprawling: Jove holds up his head At last: How dost, my boy? art dead? Quoth he; may we rise safely yet? Amphytrio answers, I have fit Of Shiv'ring on me, as an Ague. Then fight, quoth Jove, &amp; 'twill not plague you. The noise soon reached Typhon's lugs, Who lay on bed with thousand Rugs, All large, and warm as so much Buff, Yet all was scarce (or but) enough; So big was he: from bed he starts; Ods bobs, quoth he, who is't that farts So loud, and thus disturbs my rest? I'll pull his heart from out his brest, Whoe'er it be. Then quoth his brothers, 'Twas none of us, Sir, but some others: It sounded like the Thunder-crack Of Jove; he may be at our back. Keep a strict guard to night, quoth Typhon, And when 'tis day, d'on each his knife-on; Be sure you want nor swords nor trees, When once you 'gin to kill the fleas: Right early in the morn we'll rise, To execute our enterprise: We searcht (but all in vain) on ground, No God nor Goddess could be found: From heaven now they issue out, Onely that we may rise and rout: The glory of their mighty feat, Is to come on, and to retreat: Encelades shall scale their fort, Whilst others of you finde them sport With Oaks, and quarters great of Rocks; Be sure you follow close your knocks. Some slept till morn, as void of fear; Others carouse in wine and chear, Drink healths unto the Gods confusion; None apprehending their delusion. Mean while, the Gods do understand Exactly, how from Gyants hand Their distance stood, expecting hour When to engage. Mars makes a sowre Face, and is mad to fight the foe; So is the great Amphytrio. Great Jove at this doth fret and fume, When Mars so boldly durst presume: Then calling Hercules from chatter, With him he does debate the matter; Concludes they should a Council call: And Jove thereunto summons all. CANTO V. The Argument. Jove and his son Alcides go By joynt consent in quest of foe. Gyants scale heaven to a wonder; From thence are headlong thrown by thunder. A fight determines, where's the odds On Gyants side, or on the Gods. Gyants are slain, and Typhon flies: Great Jove pursues, and Typhon dies. Now come I to rehearse (in stile) As blithe as is within a mile Of Oak) the fierce and fearful blows Which past between the Gods and foes. Jove led the Gods, as 'twas his manner; The Gyants under Typhon's Banner Engage: and now was Gyants war Worse then the Counter-scuffle far. When now Encelades design'd Heav'n should be scal'd, 'twas in the mind Of Jove, and Hercules disguis'd, (Who by the Gods were so advis'd) That onely they should lurk and spie How Gyants Camp and they do lie: Or having left their strong Ale tapping, They thought perhaps to catch them napping. But Oh the fire and noise so great! Which when the Gods see, they retreat, With this resolve, the following day To fall upon them sans delay. By this time, day began to peep, And Madam Moon was gone to sleep, When Jove and great Amphytrio Saw Gyants marching to and fro, Scaling the skies without a Ladder, It made great Jove be much the gladder: For seeing Gyants so mistake, His Thunderbolt he 'gins to make Ready; and setting fire unto 't, Plows hills and mountains up by root; Down do they tumble flat as Pancakes: To clear his face, he Juno's Fan-takes, To brush the dust: he brought it out On purpose: divers of the rout Within the rubbish found their doom. By this time, other Gods make room, As from their lurking holes they run; Then shout as if they'd ne'r have done. Sometimes they hollow, then they bawl, A Jove, a Jove; the Gyants fall. Those that the dust did spare to smother, Would give one eye to save the other. Did you ne'er see on Lord Mayors day The Green-men, how they clear the way With firy Clubs; or in a Ring, At Cudgel-sport, or Wrastelling, A sturdy Butcher, Stick in hand, On back Red Wastcoat, ne'er a Band, Hat before eyes, and Bandying Shins, Smiting by th' way Spectators Chins, Till he has made a Circle, great Enough for Blades to do the feat: Or at Bear-garden, how Black Will (The Bull, I mean) doth shew his skill In tossing Butchers, when got loose, With as much ease as Fox doth Goose? Just so doth Thunder-thumping Jove Sometimes beneath, sometimes above, On right, on left, behinde, before, Till compassed by Wounds and Gore, And at his feet lay Gyants dead Some score or two, which he had sped. Alcides then with Club or Bill Does follow him to slash and kill: Alcyoneus by his arms Soon was dispatched out of harms Way, by a great blow with his Club: So fell that great and mighty Lub- Ber; he the first Alcides slew In this hot Combat. Now with Yew And Ivie crown'd, comes Bacchus on, Pretty well fluster'd, half way gon; Who gain'd great honour in the fray, O'er-running all that stood in way As torrents do; his train as free- Ly drunk, or somewhat more then he. One of them runs a Gyant through, Another beats one black and blue. Apollo then does shoot so right With shaft that's sharp as well as bright, Hits Ephialtes in the eye; And Hercules that then stood by, Pokes out his other: farewel he. Mercury does no sooner see But kills: Porphyrion made it good, Surrendring up his life and blood. Mimas gives Mars a maul o'th' pate; But Mars, as with a mortal hate, Runs to him, grasps him; so they tug: But Mars, who knew the Cornish Hug Full well, threw Gyant on his back, So that his bones did seem to crack. Dame Atropos in rage pursues Pallenus, who in vain did use Skill to avoid her; for in sum, She follow'd till she wounded bum. Encelades now turning Chance, Pipes to the Gods another Dance: Quoth he, When Honour is in doubt, Bravely to fight, is to get out. This Devil, mad that he had mist His enterprise, gave with his fist A blow upon Silenus's Hide, That broke the thing hung by his side; It was a fair and ample Flask (Which held as much as does a Cask) Fill'd with the best Canary-wine Extracted ever was from Vine: At which he more amazed stood, Then if it had been so much blood; The which had given Gyant time To have dispatcht him; but sublime Alcides to his rescue came. The Gyant, when he saw the same, Was mad: for blows went up and down, From side to feet, from thence to crown. The Goddesses stand by and curse, To see how things went worse and worse: For bloudy Typhon hews and hacks O'er legs and shoulders, arms and backs, Among the Gods: he held in hand A tall Pine, which he did command With ease: it was the same with which He formerly the Gods did switch. But Æsculapius steps in, And claps a Salve upon the shin O'th' wounded Gods, that they were sound As soon as Typhon gave the wound: And none was able to reveal Their swiftness or to hurt or heal. Jupiter mad to be withstood By Gyant, in his heat of blood Sets a great Thunderbolt on fire, And throws the same in wrath and ire At Gyants head, who with a flap From tree in hand did make it snap Like glass in shivers. Jove at that Stept back to gather up his hat; Which gave the Gyant time to seise Him by the collar: then with ease He 'gan to cuff him at his will; I think h'had given him his fill, Had not God Mercury ran by I'th' shape of Hebe. Typhon's eye No sooner saw the Girl, but she Was heard to laugh aloud, Tee-hee. At length, when Typhon spi'd the Cheat, He throws great Jove beneath his feet; But he himself had not the strength To stand when Jove was laid at length. Jupiter first got up again: With Thunder, and with might and main, He makes attempt at Gyants head, And therein fortunately sped; For ere the Gyant was aware, He found he had a soft place there. I' th' nick of this came great Alcides, With the brave Club he bears on highdays, And lays upon the Gyants head: (The blow had surely struck me dead) The Gyant backward reels, and falls; No Lion could out-roar his bawls: The three Gods fall upon his bones; Cries Mercury, Cut off his stones. But Madam Iris came to tell Great Jove what newly had befel His party; that they were almost Just ready to abandon Post. With that, the three Gods leave their foe, But bruis'd and maim'd from head to toe: Fast did they run as legs could carry; For then it was no time to tarry. But coming to the Gods recruit, The Gyants do forsake pursuit: The Gods their courage re-assume: Jupiter swore he like a Broom Would sweep the Rogues to ashes: Mars Held one whilst Venus prickt his a? With Silver Bodkin: you must know, Mars took a pride in doing so: And something too must be obscene, Or this had no mock-Poem been. At last, with pat upon the crown, He fairly fillipt Gyant down. Hercules killeth Euritus; Pan, Athos; and Hypolitus By Mercury on earth did lie: It griev'd him dev'lishly to die, Not being us'd to't heretofore: Quoth he, I now shall say no more But this, 'Tis sorrow makes men wise; The Sun must set as well as rise. Then Mimas kill'd Silenus's Ass, For which Mars made him such a pass, That you might see his body through; Mars crying, Friend, now there's for you. Then Cupid with his little sword Slew Cynus next; and on my word, Diana smote poor Thoon, that She laid him on his back so flat, As she suppos'd he had been dead; But some report he rose and fled. The Goddess Pallas then fell on, And she Pallenus slew anon. Enceladus was slain the next; (For so we finde it in the text) And Neptune with his Trident fierce The stout Pollibotes did pierce. At last the Gods to Typhon come, And he they found was biting thumb: When he beheld the Gods, with rage In combat fresh he doth engage; With legs he spurns against the Gods, Kicks on the Belly and the Cods, On Shins, and sometimes on their Bum He beats as fast as Stick on Drum. Briareus with his hundred hands, In each of them a Rock commands: These Rocks at Jove he casts at once, With hope thereby to crush his bones. But soon this fear was at an end; Nor he nor Typhon could defend Themselves a minute longer. Jove And Hercules with fury move: Jove seizeth Typhon in his arms, (For now his valour lost its Charms) And having drawn a Pocket-gun With Powder charg'd, he asked son If he should shoot. The son reply'd, They'd bury him before he dy'd: But whether they did so or no, It matters not, nor do I know. But Typhon answer'd, Death or Fate Can't strike too soon, or force too late: For he was fitted ere they came; Death brought no terrour but its name: Since life attempts with wings to flie, The Gods should see, he durst to die. Thus cunningly he holds dispute, Whilst Jove attendeth him as mute: Anon (grown desperate) by strength From Jove he struggles; and at length, When gotten loose, with might and main He nimbly trips o'er hill and plain Till got to Italy; 'tis sed, From thence to Sicily he fled; And there his final overthrow Surpris'd him: Jove from head to toe With Ætna hid him. Stories tell, This Ætna is the mouth of hell. Briareus tasted of the fate His brother did. And thus the State Of Gyants was dethron'd: for why? Who spurns against a Deity, Can less expect? Let Gods be still Unjust, no force can quell their will. But Typhon, some are bold to say, Has ever since that fatal day. Spit through the Rocks both fire &amp; smoke Enough ten thousand men to choke. However, Vice you see will finde Its pleasures have a sting behinde: And men must know, there's always Rods In piss, for those blaspheme the Gods. FINIS.</field>
