      <field name="fulltext">Studies of Resemblance and Consent. WHEN THE WORLD IS BURNING. Printed in Ainsworth's Magazine, January, 1845. (STANZAS FOR MUSIC.) When the world is burning, Fired within, yet turning Round with face unscathed; Ere fierce flames, uprushing, O'er all lands leap, crushing, Till earth fall, fire-swathed; Up amidst the meadows, Gently through the shadows, Gentle flames will glide, Small, and blue, and golden. Though by bard beholden, When in calm dreams folden,— Calm his dreams will bide. Where the dance is sweeping, Through the greensward peeping, Shall the soft lights start; Laughing maids, unstaying, Deeming it trick-playing, High their robes upswaying, O'er the lights shall dart; And the woodland haunter Shall not cease to saunter When, far down some glade, Of the great world's burning One soft flame upturning Seems, to his discerning, Crocus in the shade. [My wife and child, come close to me] My wife and child, come close to me, The world to us is a stormy sea: With your hands in mine, if your eyes but shine, I care not how wild the storm may be. For the fiercest wind that ever blew Is nothing to me, so I shelter you; No warmth do I lack, for the howl at my back Sings down to my heart, “Man bold and true!” A pleasant sail, my child, my wife, O'er a pleasant sea, to many is life; The wind blows warm, and they dread no storm, And wherever they go, kind friends are rife. But, wife and child, the love, the love That lifteth us to the saints above, Could only have grown where storms have blown The truth and strength of the heart to prove.” Printed in The Critic, May 31, 1845. TACT IN KINDNESS. Printed in the Illuminated Magazine, and in the Illustrated Family Journal, July 5, 1845. What its sound is to the shower, What its smoothness to the flower, What its silence to the kiss,— All this tact to kindness is. Of the sound of the rain, of the feel of the flower, Now there is not a bard but would carol the praise; Then to tact, when subservient to kindness its power, May not I fitly give one of my humble lays? For though tact be a word that weds music not kindly, Let the sweet of its meaning make up for its sound; Without tact all kindness must go to work blindly, And inflame when it seeks to relieve the heart's wound. Granted sometimes deception included in tact, And oftenest deception the handmaid of sin; Yet deception sometimes is by virtue enact, And some universal applauses shall win; Yea, though truth crowning glory of virtue is, still Sometimes 'tis a luxury the good must forego; Ask Trotty The Trotty Veck of “The Chimes.” who feign'd to have supp'd that starved Will Might eat the whole meal, yet without remorse go. Oh! seem when one serving, to be yourself served; Conceal not your blush when entirely bestowing; Expose, if you're woman, yourself all unnerved, When a lover's false hopes kindly all overthrowing; Serve not on one absolute plan, as though tending Herds or flocks; but each kindness effect in a way To each weakness adapted, and so be commending That tact half whose goodness words fail to display. What its sound is to the shower, What its smoothness to the flower, What its silence to the kiss,— All this tact to kindness is. SEEKERS. Printed in The Illuminated Magazine, 1845. Twice three years in this tomb she hath lain; Speak low, speak low. One like to her doth the earth yet contain? We have sought ever; is the search vain? Speak low. Answer we nothing? none have we found? Weep not, weep not. One like to her earth could but wound, Sense with but wearying trammels bound;— Weep not. I would not meet one like to her! Start not, start not. Not with hope search I the world's strife and stir, Ne'er at two shrines be I worshipper;— Start not. Part we now from around her tomb,— Speak low, speak low. East and west, through the world's gloom, Seeking ever till here we come;— Speak low. September 1845. THE MISANTHROPE'S CURE. Printed in The People's Journal, November 28, 1846. One had counted every blow Which the lofty deal the low, Till his wretched soul could know Nought beside. And to him earth seem'd a plain Where each strove his good to gain Through some other's loss or pain; Evil all. Common fate! such watch will blind Even a wise and learned mind To the goodness in mankind Rooted deep. For—be it well or be it ill— To each man the universe will, Like his own experience, still Ever loom. He grew sick with wrath and gloom; And one day, to ask his doom, In the leech's waiting-room Waited pale. But a dame and maid coming in, He from them his cure did win; How, it were a heavy sin Ever to hide. From the city's farthest side, Through the city five miles wide, Twice each week the dame here hied, Lone and old, To be present while the maid, Paying nought, sought the leech's aid; Lest the maid's fair fame might fade, Hied she here. Told this, to the dame he said, “Five miles walk'd you with this maid?” Said she, “For her ride I paid; She is ill.” “Then you are kin to her?” said he; “No, oh no! but those that be Would not do it, sir,” answer'd she Softly still. Ask'd he, “Could you both not ride?” “Little, since my husband died, Have I; she has nothing,” replied Yet the dame. Look'd he wondering in her face; Heavenly shone its human grace; And to him the world apace Heavenly shone. As when in a wood a shower Lights up every leaf and flower, Was the universe in this hour Lit for him. Oh let none learn good by stealth; Tombing so earth's real wealth; Thus regain'd its moral health This poor soul. I BELIEVE. Printed in The Reasoner, May 15, 1859. “Nature is not malignant like the gods of the people; she is dreadfully imperfect, but has shown herself capable of improvement.”—Barker. Every ship, except the ship we embark in, Gives us dreams Of bright voyaging, beauteous lands afar, and Glorious streams; Every maiden, until she has consented, Angel seems. Beautiful is nought, unless some foreground Grasp debar; All things flying attract us, and all charm till Gain'd they are; The hills are beautiful but because their summits Soar afar. What is the argument of thy discontent, Human soul? Wilt thou, oh haggardest of coursers! ever Find fit goal? Art thou a wild exception, or knoweth Nature Nothing whole? Sometimes I dream the law of thy well-being Ceaseless change, And while thy senses and affections bid thee Narrow range, Thou, like a bird encaged and fetter'd, pinest Lost and strange. But most I pondering deem that it may be That thy sight To grasp the perfect 'neath Time's imperfections Hath no might, Whilst only before the perfect canst thou expand to Fit delight. And seems it then, whilst each fruit thou pursuest Turns to dust, That, spite of all thy pride in thy pursuing, 'Twere more just That thou hadst never been unto dead-sea apples Thus out-thrust. Wait, blind-whirl'd Ixion of the flashing wheels, Life and Death! This thing is certain, that like ore good grows all Ill beneath; Other than worshippers of dreams and scriptures Live by faith. Tombs many yet may rise for us, of lifetimes Dark and brief; We may not see Time's victory, but it comes, and, For our grief, Endurance knows celestial consolations Past belief. Dissatisfaction accident is of Earth, Not Earth's plan; Years come when even its name shall be a riddle None may scan; Perchance even now his plumes outspreads the hour that Ends the ban. Roll on then, Earth, with all thy soaring mountains Pale as Ghosts! Enchant, oh maids, and glory in enchanting Man's young hosts; Toward a new future will we make your victims Road sign-posts. Mix pigments, study lines, exalt us Nature, Painters all, Burn fire on all her altars; and, though wearied, Never fall; What if 'twere come that she a Cleopatra Could not pall. Hills, shake not off one torrent, nor grow pale thou, Golden Sun! The music of the world thou light'st up hath not Yet begun. Get ready, women! fitly have ye not yet Once been won. Nor shake thou mockingly thy dart, oh Death! Know, oh king! We have made friends with Melancholy, and she Thee will bring Gently among us, yea to teach new music Them that sing. There is a heaven, though we to hope to pass there May not dare; Where adoration shall for ever adore some Perfect fair; And we can wait thee, Death, our eyes enfixed Firmly there. Jersey A WINTER HYMN TO THE SNOW. Printed in The Athenœum, September 14, 1878. Come o'er the hills, and pass unto the wold, And all things, as thou passest, in rest upfold, Nor all night long thy ministrations cease; Thou succourer of young corn, and of each seed In plough'd land sown, or lost on rooted mead, And bringer everywhere of exceeding peace! Beneath the long interminable frost Earth's landscapes all their excellent force have lost, And stripp'd and abject each alike appears; Not now to adore can they exalt the soul,— Panic, or anger, or unrest control,— Or aid the loosening of Affliction's tears. No more doth Desolateness lovely sit Lone on the moor; no more around her flit From far high-travelling heaven the sailing shades; The shrunk grass shivers feebly; reed and sedge, By frozen marsh, by rivulet's iron edge, Bow, blent into the ice, mix'd stems and blades. The mountains soar not, holding high in heaven Their mighty kingdoms, but all downward driven Seem shrunken haggard ridges running low; And all about stand drear upon the leas, Like giant thorns, the frozen skeleton trees, Dead to the winds that ruining through them go. The woodland rattles in the sudden gusts; Frozen through frozen brakes the river thrusts His arm forth stiffly, like one slain and cold; The glory from the horizon-line has fled; One sullen formless gloom the skies are spread, And black the waters of the lakes are roll'd. Come! Daughter fair of Sire the sternest, come, And bring the world relief! to rivers numb Give garments, cover broadly the broad land; All trees with thy resistless gentleness Assume, and in thine own white vesture dress, And hush all nooks with thy persistings bland. Come! making rugged gorge and rocky height Even more than fur of ermine soft and white, And cover up and silence roads and lanes; And, while the ravish'd wind sleeps hush'd and still, Wreaths, little infancy with glee to fill, Upheap at doorways and at casement-panes. Fancy's most potent pandar! gentlest too: Man, rising on the morn, the scene will view Thus, all transform'd, with no less sweet surprise Than stirreth him to whose half-doubting sight Sudden appears beloved friend, masqued bright In not less fair than unexpected guise. And some will think the earth, in white robes drest, Seems sinking fast in a great trance of rest, Beyond all further reach of wintry ill; And some will say it seems as though a ghost Appear'd; and thus, on fancy's seas far toss'd, With doubtful shadowy joys their spirits fill. Thy task complete, if to the amazing scene With Night should come, full-orb'd, Night's radiant Queen, How the whole race from out their homes will gaze! Hard hearts will restless grow, and mean men sigh, And wish they could be holier, and on high Some, whispering words of heaven, meek thanks will raise. I, sweet celestial kisser! from croft home-crown'd, From ancient mead by stateliest trees girt round, From wilds where thou the earth lovest all alone, Shall watch thee shower thy kisses, and all the hours Rapt worship solemnize, and bless the Powers That let thy loveliness to my soul be known! TO DEATH. Printed in the Academy, November 16, 1878. I see thee in the churchyard, Death, And fain would talk with thee, While still I draw the young man's breath And still with clear eyes see. Thou wilt not make my spirit sink, Thou dost not move my fear; More sad more blest I often think The mortal sojourner here. Here where the symbols all of fair With vileness mix'd we find; Where knowledge soothes not, and where care Haunts most the finest mind. 'Tis thou who know'st if any knows Of life's wild maze the key; And if behind its marvellous shows Some Master moving be. And haply of some farther life That shall this life adjust, Or if we are men for threescore years, And then unconscious dust. For this, oh Death, of thee I crave Some sign; but not to pray Against the inevitable grave Or self-contain'd decay. Alas! since first our fragile race Appear'd this earth upon, Hast thou been question'd thus, and trace Of answer never won. In vain the young from youth's delights, From lips whose kissing bloom Bright chaos makes of days and nights, To thee defiant come. In vain the old with trembling tread And trembling hands applies, And strives to coax thy silence dread, And lifts beseeching eyes. And vainly I desert my post In life's poor puppet game, And seek thee where this silent host Of tombs thy power proclaim. When midnight wraps the world in sleep, Or when the vanishing stars And morn once more, new day to keep, Rolls back her golden bars. In vain, in vain, but one reply In thy sad realm I find; Some fresh grave ever meets the eye, And mocks the unanswer'd mind. June 10, 1860. A WARNING. Printed in The Illuminated Magazine, 1845. He took his heart away from his fellows, And gave it to angels fair; But the angels cannot commune with the human, Nor, if they could, would they dare. Then took he back his heart from the angels, And over it long he mourn'd; For he either could not or would not offer it Back to the race he scorn'd. But all things die if utterly self-bound; And slowly this lone heart died: And ever the Scorner is doom'd to wander, Meaner than all beside.</field>
