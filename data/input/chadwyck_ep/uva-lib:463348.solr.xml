      <field name="fulltext">THE MVSES-TEARES, for the high, Heroik, and neuer-too-much praised, HENRY, Prince of Wales, &amp;c. The HAND of heauen (as quick, as it is strong, And moues this ALL, to all it moues vnto:) Hath turn'd our hopes, to feares, (and griefes among) In his Lifes LINE, which it did late vndo. Princely-perfection being past the prime, And, neare the highest grow'th (O dismall turne!) Is turn'd into the Roote, this Winter-time, Ner'e to retire till GOD in Flesh returne! He, vpon whome the Nations Eyes were bent As on a most auspitious blazing-Starre Is now extinguish'd; yet, the light hee lent, Fore-shew'd he would haue thundred lowd, in War; For, in his Eares no musick sweet did sound, But Trumpets, Drummes, and Phifes: and, at his meate, (While they did others hearing but confound) They solac'd his; and made his stomake great! Th'expertest Fortifier, and Engineere He sought; who taught him either skill, so young, That he his Teachers taught: so, did appeare Too ripe, too soone, to last (so ripe) too long! And, in all exercise of Armes he was Vnmatch'd by any of his yeares: For, He Past subiects so, as he did subiects passe, In Birth, Mind, Vertue, Glory, and Degree! The Doing-Horse (all Eyes can witnesse it) He made much more than Do: yet; sate so sure As they (but where are they that so can sit?) That back the wildest Beasts, yet, sit secure! In few; no Feate of such Actiuity As graced Action, and the Actor too, But it (with most admir'd Agility) He did past all that best, so young, could do! With Arts and Letters hee so stor'd his MIND That both knew all therein, y'er Youth could know: So, Arte and Nature were as Curst, as Kind, To Cleaue so to him, and to Leaue him so! His Spirit and Body were at endlesse strife Which should be Actiu'st in all Princely Parts: For, both were full of Grace, as full of Life; Both which winne Glory, with both Hopes, and Hearts! That actiue Spirit his Meditations rais'd Aboue the Spheare of GREATNES; that doth rise From those Perfections that do perish prais'd, To seek PERFECTION prais'd; and neuer dies! And, like a Soule (that nought on Earth can fill) Seeking for al-suffizing Aliments, Still mounts aboue her selfe (in Minde, and will) Till she hath found what fully her contents: So, his rare Soule, (beeing euer on her VVings, Soone cloide with whatsoe're the Earth holds deere) Sought to suffize her with eternall Things; Which made her stay so much the shorter here! The World could not containe her; not as He To whose ambition Earths Rotundity Seem'd but an Angle: no; but Shee did flee The VVorld, and such vaine Pride; yet, fled more high! She fled to Him whose Center's euery where, And Circle no where: for, true Eaglet, She On Iustice SONNE (her Eyes being strong, as cleare) Still lou'd to looke, to shew her Dignity! But, while She kept within her Prison-walls (Or Iaile of Flesh) She, through the windowes, saw To all that in Discretions Compasse falls; And, ordred all that All by Reasons Law. His Seruants so hee swai'd (and that alone, Himselfe beeing vnder Tutors) as appear'd That they were gouern'd by some Salomon; For which he was no lesse Belou'd, than Fear'd. Reward and Punishment (being as the weights By which our Horologe of life is mou'd) Fell euer through Him (from Celestiall Heights) On none, but whom true vertue loth'd, or lou'd! If then, his Priuate in such order stood, How had the publike done when hee had swai'd? They had beene like for Grace, in likely-hood; And (for our Common-good) as Good, as stai'd! The High'st all good things hath in Essence still; Ill, in his Vnderstanding-pow'r; but Man Hath good things by Intelligence; but ill He hath in Essence: for, no Good he can! But He, whose goodnesse rauish'd him from hence, Was Good, in Nature; by his BEING, blest: But Ill he had but by Intelligence; Which he, with Grace, corrected, being best! Some Kings are more than Men in their beliefe; But, in their liues such Beasts as neuer liu'd: The chiefe Offenders than, are oft the CHIEFE: But this, Belou'd, liu'd well, and well beleeu'd! The Simile twixt God and Man is such, That God is said to be immortall Man; And Man a mortall God: He was so much; Whose want we waile much more than sorrow can. His Princely lookes compos'd so rarely were Of venerable grauity and grace, That one did Loue prouoke, the other feare; And both, in one, still shew'd a sacred Face! His Ire was temperate, sith he knew so well How ill t'was in Warme Fortunes to be hot; Sith, like great Ruines, those it quite doth quell On whome it falls; and, lights on equall Lot! It is to rash; (and so must needs offend) To do ought well: For, it cures ill with ill: Then, to referre a Vice to Ire to mend, Is Vice to cure by Vice (outragious) still. Great Mindes in Choler, should be euer like The highest Planets, that are slowest mou'd; And neuer vse (how euer mou'd) to strike, Till they indulgent meanes haue throughly prou'd. The fire of Ire, that from cold feare proceeds Prouoks the Subiect, put past feare, in hate To make attempts (although for it he bleeds) To free his feare, that makes him desperate. Nor is he quiet kept, to keepe him low, (As some affirme) for eu'ry hope that giues, Least like-li-hood to raise his ouer-throw, Vnder new Lords, for such he plots, and striues. Then as from loue proceeds a State more sure, (Though moderate) so, that that comes from feare, Although more absolute, doth lesse endure: For feare, growne des'prate, it will ouer-beare. For, Cruelty from Cowardize doth spring, Sith still couragious Minds their force imploy But on resisting foes; then hee's no King, (But Tyrant) that but prostrate Friends destroys. It is a weakenesse of great Pow'r, and Will, To loue them least that most they do offend: Whome Kings offend, they will offend them still; And, ne're for-giue th'offended till their end, But hate to see them; sith (perhaps) their sight But minds them of the wrongs they do them still: In this, this Gaul-lesse Prince tooke no delight, But did quite otherwise in Deed and Will! The Surgeons that embalmed, and embowelled him, found no Gaule at all in him, as it is confidently reported. Ambition, (the Soules Shirt, sith that's the Vice Shee last puts off) no more transported his Than Cæsars was with glories auarice; For, his Ambition wholy aim'd, at This! Kings should haue innocency Columbine, To do no more than harmelesse Creatures should; With which they should haue Wisdome Serpentine, To do no lesse then Circumspection would: And euer, with the wakefull'st Will and Wit, To stretch their power beyond their power (though great) But only for the publike-benefit, For which they smell most sweete, when most they sweat! A Prince that ties himself himself vnto Doth much mistake himselfe: For, hee's not his; Nor, is the STATE his: but, he still must do, As if he were the STATES: for, so he is. From Benefits, come Obligations: and, From such more such: and, so t'is Sire, and Sonne, Effect, and Cause; Yet still doth, mouing, stand In Will and Pow'r of Natures, like the Sunne. Such was this Prince, who look'd with watchful Eyes To all that might with State, in Time, haue stood: He aw'd the Great, and (iustly, most precise) Discount'nanc'd such as Greater were than good. “For, such as wilbe Sheepe, the Wolfe deuoures: Then, sheepish Kings must flee all Beasts of prey, Or keepe Presumption downe in subiect Pow'res, Lest long conniuence make it long for sway. Contempt t'a Prince, more dang'rous is than hate: For, Hate, by feare, is held from bold Attempt: But, SCORNE doth make it daring; then a STATE In danger stands, that stands, so, in Cont?pt! Lightnings put by with winde but of a Cap; And oft great STATES (that might the world comman'd Fall with the smallest accidents that hap: Then, if Contempt they beare, they cannot stand. This made this Prince betimes to haue an Eye To all that saw but how they high might grow By wrong and scorne of PRINCIPALITY, Sith well he knew they ill themselues did know. His Deeds did euermore exceed his words In Vertue, and Effect: nor, would He speake But still with Caution fit for sou'raigne Lords, Who know they bruize their Crownes, when Words they break! For Princes safer Pris'ners are, by far, Vnder their words almighty-binding pow'r Than they are vnder strongest Bolt or Barre; Because their Words (like Gods) are euer sure! If otherwise, we cannot call them Gods (As God himselfe doth stile them) if they be Vnlike through that iniustice; and (like Clods) Do nought but soile the seate of their Degree. No: Tongues, &amp; Pens wil wound their Names to death; Nay, past, sith past, sharpe Tongues &amp; Pens can giue Them black Reproch: for, with their harmeful breath, Their Vices die; but stil their shames may liue! For, seeing Iustice cannot touch their liues, Its reason it should touch their Names (too nought) For feare whereof a TITVS often striues: To be not what he is, but what he ought! For, it is hard to play an After-game Of Reputation wel: or, not to loose By eu'ry cast, though wel we play the same, Sith all our Gaine to our first Losses goes! But Vertue made our Hercës to preserue His Name from blemish; not these by-respects: He Vertue seru'd, that so She Him might serue With fullest Glory voide of all Defects. Not like the Starres (that yeeld but little light Because they are so high) with him it far'd: But (like the Sunne) was bright'st at greatest height; And stil his Minde vnto his Fortunes squar'd. BEING, without well Being, cursed is; And, so, the greater Beeing, the greater curse: But, he being Great, was euer blest in this That he did Grace, by Nature, kindly nurse! Nature in HIM, admir'd what she had wrought, At least she might, if She, (most wonderfull Of things created) could admire at ought That's made good, great, stout, wise, and beautiful. He was the richest Trophey FORTVNES Pow'r Could reare in HONORS Theater; for, stil NATVRE did doate on Him (her Bellamoure, Or Master-peece) the Wonder of her skil! Beauty, TIMES flowre, though delicate it be Yet soone it dies: so holds comparison With Phydias collours; which (though faire to see) Were blemisht with each Breath that breath'd thereon But that immortall beauty of the Minde Wherewith He was endow'd, was so ingrain'd In his Soules Faculties, that by no winde Or blast of Enuy, it can e're be stain'd! No: He most strictly ey'de his better Part; And in the Glasse of Heau'ns eternall LAW Righted th' Apparell of his royall Heart As best became his FORME, which there he saw: For, no Mans Fortunes, nor his high renowne Can possibly be worthy for his End; Which hath made Kings of Yore to quit their Crowne, That they to better Ends might wholy tend. Life's but a Supposition, or Non-ENS; That's not perceptible; because it IS; Then, streight IS not, but by Intelligence; And, while it IS, it is but most amisse! Nothing is certaine, but vncertainty Beneath the Moone; which varies like our Mindes: For, Man's a Maze of Mutability, Wherein both Sin and Grace stil turnes, and winds! It's good to die than, yer wee die; because A life too liuely proues too deadly oft: He shootes not well that vp his Arrow drawes And eyes no Mark below, nor that aloft. But some mis-doe themselues, themselues to hide From cruell Fortunes most impetuous Blowes: But neuer Kings, but Cowards, so haue di'd; Yet Emper'ours (base, as bad) haue beene of those! It is an act of Charity to long, Euer to liue for others good: than they That both to God and Nature do such wrong, (As hatefull Monsters) seeke their both decay! And some so long doe liue that they interre Their Glory y'er they die; and die but when The World doth hate them deadli'st; or some War Takes them away; as Beasts, from ciuill Men! Yet, Life's but Bondage, wer't not free'd by Death; Nay, Life's a Sicknesse that so mortall is, That who so liues, must die: and strongest Breath Is not still long'st; but, often more amisse! Life may be tane from Man, by any Man; But Death by no Man; none dare him abide: Nor, Pow'r, nor Art, nor Loue, Life lengthen can: For, if they could, this Prince had neuer di'd! Yee Iles, (whereof He was the Hope) with Feares Shake where ye stand; or with sighes shift your Clime; And be inuirond with a sea of Teares, Where neuer Sunne may see the face of TIME! Or, settle else, where still his Beames may burne Our frozen Hearts; and, turne vs all to Black; That eu'n our Skinnes as-well as Hearts may mourne For him whose want turnes all our comforts back. Black's but a meere Priuation, and no Hue, As Darkenesse is of Light: that's fitt'st for vs, Whom Griefes Cimerian darkenesse doth subdue, Being quite depriu'd of Light of comfort, thus. The feeling-sence alone for mortall life Is necessary: but, the rest not so; For, Life may BE without them: then, let Griefe And Sense to feele it, ne're our liues forgo! For Him that might the death of Griefe haue beene Had Heau'n not enui'd Earth his longer stay; But (ah) he grew so mellow, being greene, That he, by nature, soone did fall away! With whom our Hearts are fall'n; and with the fall, (On Craggy Cares) are swol'n so full of wo That they can hardly hold: but, O, this ALL Is at this stay, that staies but falling so! What hold, or hope, or helpe is than, in ALL, But He that's All in ALL? sith such a PROP, (So young, so strong, and sound, till he did fall) Is Feauer-shaken downe from HIGHNES Top! Floate heauiest Griefe on Times eternall Teares T'a Deluge turn'd; and sinke all Ioy therein: Floate Grife to Death: sinke Ioy to depth of feares; Sith, in the Hau'n, our hopes so sunke haue bin! So faile their hopes that hope, by Sinne, for Grace: Heau'ns hate we vrge; and yet (so, vrge it more) We looke for loue: But, O, such Life, such Case! “A desp'rate Salue, must cure a desp'rate SORE! We thought our CROWNE so staid with many Props (So Yong, and strong) that no cold Puf of feare (How euer strong) could once but shake our Hopes, Which now this Blast doth reele, and backward beare! But yet to feare too much is to receiue Ill fortunes y'er they come; and, that is ill: Our feares aswell as hopes may vs deceiue: Than feare we so, as hope may hold vs still. Feare beares Hope backward to a forward Stay; So forward, as wee feare more going back, When in our Soules (besides) our Sinnes we waigh, Which threate (auert it Heau'n) our vtter wrack! But bee; O be propitious, highest POW'R, To vs: and make our Royal PLANT to spring Vnto that Greatnesse that may long'st endure; And Branches beare, that may beare many a KING! But yet (O Death!) GRIEF wil not leaue vs so; It turnes againe; and Passion (which doth swel, Say Reason what it will) will with vs goe Vnto the Graue, which Heau'n is to this Hel! Why from the Surgeon doe we turne our Eye When, with his Probe, wee see him search a wound, But that wee know our Sences sou'raignty Ouer our Reason, might vs, with it, confound! Than, can wee see the Hand of DEATH to gage His HEART, (beeing ours; and so, through ours should go And not auert our Eyes, in ruthful rage? If so we can, we can be cruell so! But, O, wee needs must see this dismall DEED, (At least in Minde) for which our Hearts are rent: The letting of him bloud did make them bleed: For which we curse the CAVSE, and Instrument. It is, almost, a Miracle to finde A great, and liuely-Spirit well gouerned; But his rare Spirit (be'ing such) did turne, and winde As the Phisition still, it mannaged! Indiffrent Spirits, for Rule, farre better doe Than Spirits too mighty, who are good for nought But to torment themselues, and others too: Yet His, being great, hee ruled as he ought! The Spirit doth owe the Flesh a Sou'raignes care Not a Slaues seruice: for, if Flesh bee free, 'Twill make the Spirit but seruile, base, and bare; But if the Spirit; the Flesh shall honor'd be! And, looke how when the Heart is sicke, the HEAD And all the Members, of the griefe haue part, But neuer die, vntill the HEART be dead; So, HEAD and Members die with this our HEART! We die, though yet we moue, with griefe conceau'd For this his death; whose Life gaue all our Parts Their liuely motion; which they had receau'd From his rare vertue, Life of all our Hearts. Nor can we (ah!) liue other-wise than dead (Although, in Death, we liue; or, lifelesse plight) For him that gaue vs Heart; and Life, our HEAD; So liue we now, without or Life, or Sp'rit! It is a kind of ioy in case of moane Not to be single: Common-miserie (Though heauiest) lighter weighes on one alone, Then doth his priuat light aduersitie! As Peace is Warre to men impo'urisht growne; Who, in the totall ruines of the STATE, Had rather be o'rewhelm'd, than in their owne; So, each mans Crosse seemes most vnfortunate! But in our Case, it is not so, we see: For this our common losse so sad doth lie Vpon our Soules, that nought can heauier be; Although it were, with torment, oft to die! Yet, tis high'st Courage lowly to sustaine The heauiest Plagues which for our sinnes are sent: And to be patient qualifies the paine; And, makes vs, at the low'st, most excellent! But, to resist, rage, murmur, or complaine, Is as effeminate as Men may do: Than to be subiect so, is so to raigne Kings of our selues; and Saints with Angells too! “Humility, of Men, doth Angells make; “And Pride, of highest Angells, maketh Deuills: “In Pride, all Euills did beginning take: “But, in Humility, release from Euills! W'are borne to Sorrowes: would we than be free? That were iniustice: Than, we needs must beare The lawes to which all Flesh must subiect be, Vnlesse we would aboue all Flesh appeare! Our highest pleasures still do tend vnto The deepest sighes: those Wrinckles of the face That serue for Laughing, serue for Weeping too; And, extreame Laughing sheddeth Teares apace! GREATNES (as we mis-stile it) how e're stout, And glorious too it be) is, as we proue, But like a Lightnings-flash soone in, and out Of Life and Light, that gets more Hate, than Loue! Our ALL's but Nothing than: For, that which IS Must be eternall: For, what IS, must stay Such as it is a Thought (at least) but this Is with a Thought, or chang'd, or gone away! Now sith the deerest of these Mundane things, Do fall so cheape from highest Holds they haue, And that both Semy-gods aswell as Kings Do but engorge the most insatiate Graue; What Sense haue such that see this daily done, And yet relie on life, that but appeares As doth a Vapor rising with the Sunne But straight to vanish, in a Vale of Teares! For, Kings none other-wise than Mists descend Downe from the lofty Mountaines to the Vales Where they through Fortunes Sun-shine soone ascend, And vanish straight like dew the Sunne exhales. Thus can Discretion teach Griefe what to say To ease it selfe; but Griefes if great they are Will still be mute; or else (as mad) will bray: And so our Griefes (as mad) do make vs fare. Our LOSSE so far transcends the highest Bounds Of humane-wisdome, patiently to beare, That it our Sufferance, and our Selues confounds With all distraction, ioyn'd to griefe, and feare; Saint Iames, thy house, (late house of ioyes extreame. Is now an House of Mourning; sith this Mate Of Angells, di'd therein, yet liues with them; And, left that haplesse House to endlesse hate. Those costly Pictures (curious Proofes of skill. Wherewith that House (like Heau'n) he late did grace) There may they hang in Vtter-darknes till The fowlest Spinners scarfe their fairest Face! That if, here-after, any curious Eye (That would to Hell to see a Curious sight) Come there to see them, it may looke awry, As lothing to belold their vglie plight. Their Co-inhabitants be euer grimme, Grym Desolations, sterne Consociates; Blacke ougly Bats, and Owles; with Zim, and Iim; Esay. 13. 21. 22.T'affright all Flesh with horror from the Gates! This, for the Place wherein he di'd: The Time, (Sith much more dismall) much more still b'accurst: Let neuer Sunne the steepe Meridian climbe On that blacke Day, but clad in Sable first! Let all the Starres that are maleuolent, Lend all the light that Day (like Night) shall giue; That Men may see but onely to lament With wofull'st action, that may moue to grieue! And sith great Kings their Birth-daies celebrate With all that Pompe can yeeld; or Pleasure prooue; On this black Death-day still, (through publike hate) Let ne're the least pompe stirre, nor pleasure moue! Musike, be euer silent on this Day; Or with Chromatick Dumps our losse lament: And, O yee heau'nly Spheares, sound so, or stay; And, all confuse beneath the firmament! For, Common-griefe's not capable of forme: Our Griefe is common; then, confound all Mirth On this curst Day; let DEATH then, euer storme, Yea, make the Sunne, himselfe, lie hid with Earth! If ought be else, Poetick-rage, or worse, Or Loue (that can doe all) can mooue to hate This cursed day, to adde vnto this curse, Let it fall on it, as most reprobate! Henry (deere Henry!) O that Words we had So steept in Brine that all, through them, might see That We, with Reason, are growne iustly mad: Sith Reas'n doth rage, most iustly, but for Thee! For, soules that haue Intelligence and Will, And by the first discerne what they haue lost, Can, through the Last, but last distracted still With Rage that Reason rectifieth most! If GOD we lose, what Reas'n can be so great (For, greatest Reas'n best knowes the greatest losse:) But it, with Griefe, will quite it selfe forget, Remembring such a Soule-confounding CROSSE! Then, when we loose a Prince, like God for State, Stile, Vertue, and Effect, what Reason can But fare as it were rightly reprobate? If not; such Reas'n must be in more then Man! If well, wee take a CROSSE of so great weight That breakes the Back of suffrance, with a Thought, (Though propt with strongest grace) our dul conceipt Of Goodnesse lost, shewes we are good for nought. No: sooner can our Soules discourse forbeare, And cease to take Reports from Wit and Sence Than we (like Blocks) such Blowes of Fate can beare As maime our Soules through their Intelligence! Iob.If He of HVS, whose patience (being crost) Endur'd the shock of Hels first mortall charge, Yet, in the second, found his patience lost Among but Blaines, that did but Bloud enrage; Then how should flesh, lesse fenc'd with Grace, sustaine So many Wounds, which through our Princes Heart Death fastens on our soules, such hurt, such paine, Makes Out-rage seeme to act but Iudgements Part. Ier. 20, 7. 8. 9.The Prophet being but in prison cast For speaking what he ought, and as hee should Vow'd neuer more to mention heau'n, and past So farre in heate, that hee the High'st contrould. Then, though wee may not, from the slips of Saints, Take warrant flat to fall, yet, for such CAVSE To vse Poetick-rage in our Complaints, (Falling past fury) stands with Reasons Lawes: Oh! that VVits forces than, that Reas'n controules, Could fall into this sacred Rage; and make All Times to come, to suffer with our soules; Or, force the props of future Worlds to shake! For, passion beeing in our soules conceiu'd, Forth-with is formed in our speech; and so, Passing from vs, by others is receiu'd; And, makes in them impression of like Wo. Oh! Eloquence, (the Routher of our Minde, Swaying th' Affects thereof, which way it lists) Ioyne with our sighes (now) like resistlesse Winds To lose our soules in sorrowes endlesse Mists: For, Griefe enforc'd by Fate, and Eloquence (Oh FORCE that still the owne desires fulfils! Than Tyrants sway, hath no lesse violence Ore our weake soules, that works but what it Wils! Yet nought's more eloquent than TRVTH (most str?g!) Than our tru Grief (that seas of sorrow weeps) Must mooue al Mindes, by th' Engin of our Tongue, To floate to endlesse Woes on DOLORS Deepes. Men must be wrought like Ir'ne; that's first made soft With fire, yer coater cooles it: fires of VVit Must make them more then supple (sure, and oft) Y'er Teares can coole strong passions burning-fit. Than, if my Wit were great, as is the CAVSE Of this our sorrow, it should so enflame The World with passion as it ne're should pause To showre forth streames of Teares to quench the same! But so this Griefe distracts it, that it can But make imperfect Offers; it's too cold To thaw the frozen Hearts of euery Man: For, Death (not Dolor) hath all hearts in hold. Oh words! O sence! how sencelesse both wee hold (Though most significant) that cannot curse This Day past execration; would yee could (And I had you to vse) do that, or worse! But why, O why! doe I accursed fend, So curse the Day wherein He so was blest For whose cause so I curse? My knees I bend, And begge for Grace, sith t'was in Minde distrest. Then I retract my Curses; and I blesse That blessed God that giues and takes (so free) The best Things euer: for, we must confesse, This was as good as could, in Nature, Bee! For, if in nature, there could be a Prince Aboue the pitch of highest Hopes; then Hee Was more then such, in our experience: Then, can our Griefes be lesse than now they bee? Yet Arte, and Adulation (making Eight Of seu'n) that make so many famouzed, But yet the eight make more for state, and weight) Do oft, in ouer-righting, wrong the dead! But few, if dead, are flattered, if their friends Liue not in Wealth, or Greatnesse: so, the scopes Of all such Clawers scratch for priuate Ends: Yet, Kings will flatter, to attaine their Hopes! But, who for priuate Grace, (and Guifts among) Of wicked Princes doe renowne their Names Do priuate-Iustice, so, with publike-Wrong; So, both is wronge, done right to both their shames. Then, here's our happy infortunity, To praise him, dead, so strong in lyuing-Might; Whose erned praise seemes hired flattery; But this we cannot shunne; and doe him right! Then, O! receiue, great Prince of Palatines, Our Muses Teares (true records of our Harme) In these sad Numbers of her blubbred Lines, Eu'n for his sake, of whom th'hast lost an ARME If not much more! for, neuer could two Hearts As th' had, beene one, long since, and cleft in two; Till now, at meeting, streight reioyn'd their Parts: So did your Hearts at your first meeting doe. But death, too enuious death, disseuer'd them As soone as ioyn'd; than wee may iudge by this, Thy causeful Sorrowes needs must be extreame Like ours: whose heart was ours, and ours was His! And to what season had as spightfull Time Reseru'd this seu'ring? but eu'n then, when thou (To make that Knot more sure, in your youths prime) Cam'st to espouse his HALFE; wo-wedded now! So, when thy ioyes were flowing, neere the full, It, past the lowest ebbe, fell headlong-wise; And wert not Fortune thee did yet not lull In Cradle of sure hope, it neere could rise! Thy Fortunes highest ayme (nought can bee higher That on the Earth is found) is the rar'st Iemme That er'e was cas'd with flesh: then, to aspire That to enioy, is ioy beyond extreame! A Sister sutable to such a Brother; The high'st desire of mightiest Potentates: Good in the Abstract, ther's not such another Now to bee match'd; nor in the power of FATES! Fame that best knows her; prompts me what to speake; All, that attend her, Fames report mainetaines; And, all in all, into her prayses breake; Yea, loue the ground that this Belou'd, sustaines! But, ô, wee cannot looke vpon her Worth But must reflect on His that's gonne; sith He Was as her Self; and one Wombe brought them forth, Which, for these BLESSINGS, euer-blessed bee. But (ah) he Was, and is not; WAS! (ô word Able to strike the Soule of Patience dead) And why not IS? Hee IS, and is a LORD Whom Angels serue, and with their Food is fedd, He di'de indeed; it's true: nay, false it is; He did not die, that chang'd but lifes annoy For life of comfort in eternall BLISSE: Yet, thus he di'de, that thus yet liues in ioy! Deere Vault, that veil'st him, mummanize his Corse Till it arise in Heauen to be crown'd: Sith (though on Earth he rarely ran his course) No Crowne, for Prize, though it he toucht, he found. But Breath no sooner left him but it was Inuolu'd with aire of FAME, and blowne so high, That it doth Ariadneis CROWNE surpasse, And made a FLAME new kindled in the Skye. He di'de in shew than, but yet liues in Deed In Heauen and Hearts of all that honor Grace, In HIGHNES Heart: he di'de then, so to speed Of Glory heere, and in that surer Place. Eu'n when his Grand-dames Corpse was re-inshrin'de; As if his Corpse, in shades of Death, through loue, Had long'd to meete with Hers that seem'd so kinde To seeke to meete with his, through her remoue! Eu'n then (the will of Heau'n so fore-assign'd) He left his Breath, ye'r he the Crowne possest; And went in Person, (Princely still inclin'd) To meete and greet her in eternall rest! But so he spent, and left his breath, (we hope) That's praise, in Blisse, stil breaths Eternity; As it doth fill the Earth, and heau'nly Cope: For such a hopefull life did neuer die: Then, die he neuer can while Vertue liues; For, HE, and SHE are still Corelatiues! Feare, and the Pit, and the Snare, are vpon thee, O inhabitant of the Earth! Esay. 24. 17. SOBS FOR THE LOSSE of the most Heroick Prince HENRY. Nonfrustranascitur, qui bene moritur. Now; all we see, of worth, go all in blacke, For Him whose worth all times shall loue and lack. The hopefull'st heire apparant to a CROWNE, That Grace could giue, yet, call the guift hir owne. Some, waile the losse of priuat friends till death; Then when so many clos'd were in his Breath, How should that some, (nay all) his losse deplore? That Sorrowes-Sea, no bottom hath, nor Shoare! All praise is shut in Bounds, saue that of ONE Who nere is lost, but of the lost alone: But none that's lost in shew, not deede, or name, Could e'rne more praise than this tru Soule of FAME! Hee's gon; but, going, left such light behinde As doth the Moone ecclipse, the Sunne so blind With splendor, that the light they yeeld vs now, Is farre lesse good in deede, lesse great in show! The Heau'ns, that lent him, are growne poore; or wee Deserue no trust, (sith we bad detters be) To take him ere the time by Nature set, Yet, for short intrest, keepe vs still in debt! Celestiall Sprits, are yee so greedy growne So soone to giue and take (from vs) your owne? Or did you enuy that we should haue had A Head so good to Members al so bad? Say, we were Marchants that nere kept our day, Or (at the best) but pray when we should pay: Or (yet if better, when no faith wee keepe) Fall on our knees, and for grace sigh and weepe: Yet sith yee swim in all celestiall STORE Yee might a while haue borne with Spirits so poore! But were we poore in spirit, we had beene rich In your account: but O we are not such! Our Pride (that makes vs beggers eu'ry way) Make yee mistrust our faith (too poore to pay.) Well; it is ill with vs (poore Soules, profane) And worse, (much worse) for that which you haue tane. Yea, (which is worst) will neuer lend Him more: O Spirit (Celestiall Spirits, which we adore) For-beare the rest we owe, to grace incline; Trust vs vpon a pawne of Angells wine, Which from the heauy Vessells of our eyes Shall runne till you shall say It doth suffice! And Lord of Hoastes (their Lord and ours) beseige Our Hearts with feare till Loue doth giue this Pledge. And so dispose the goods we haue of thine, (In and Without vs) as we may resigne All to thy praise; that (though in debt we stand) Thou maist supply our wants still, on our Band! On which, we humbly pray thee lend vs health, And Heads and Hands t'vphold the Common-wealth Of our owne Stocke: or, if in future-time, (As heretofore) some stranger vp do climbe On Ladder of our Branches to our CROWNE He may be such as nere may put vs downe! AN EPITAPH ON THE Death of the immortall HENRY Prince of Wales. Mvch Briefly said, and clearely too, Is hard: yet that much Art can do: But here much griefe and little Art, Is forc'd to act so hard a Part. Nature and Arte, with Grace, and Fortune too, Sought Time, and Death to conquer, (as they do) In this Heroick PRINCE, who, through those fou'r, Orethrowes Times force, and Deaths almighty Pow'r! All that was in Him, was much more than all That's found in Flesh, if young, and naturall! Can Wit say more for his true glory here? Yes: for, he was a Prince without a Peere! What more? why this: He di'de but in his prime; Yet, in perfection, elder was than TIME! And more compleate than PLACE: for fame that growes From his great WORTH alone, no lymit knowes! If Time, and Death, and Place than, be to seeke For such another; He to none is like But him who hath no like; yet like in MIND; And, for they haue no like in either kinde! This King of Princes, and that God of Kings: Are like themselues than, and none other things! And, like them-selues, they liue in Heau'n, and Vs, In spight of Enuy, Time, and Death: Than, thus. (In briefe) wee bound their boundles EXCELLENCE: One, no such GOD; the other, no such PRINCE! AN OTHER. Fortune, and Art, and Nature straue To giue much more than er'e they gaue To Him that lies heare vnderneath The grace of Nature, Time, and Death! Three CROWNES were neere Him; and the forth, He might, by RIGHT, haue wone by WORTH! Which, in his youth, presag'd his spirit Would ren'd, in age, from WRONG, his RIGHT! That Spirit (like his, that's most compleat) Sought nought but what was good and GREATE! He soone was ripe; too soone to win, What Time, much toyl'd, and Art drawes in. Who casts for Crownes, must haue no small Might, right, skill, will, and Time with all: But whose perfection Time out-goes Winnes but LAVD'S Crowne yer life he lose! His Gaine and Losse then, are so eu'n, As he is pleas'd with both in Heau'n. Teaching all Heires to CROWNES, and KINGS To be the best of Earthly things! Far-well (rare PRINCE!) nor Time, nor Death Shall stint thy glory with thy breath: For when, with them, lowd fame decaies, Silence shall whisper out thy praise! CONSOLATIONS for, and to the King. Great King in sorrowes, now, aswell as STATE, Whom Fortunes grace makes most vnfortunate: For, no more fauour could of FATE be had, Than such a Sonne, whose losse makes Fate as bad. This string sounds deadly, Ile not touch it more, Least that my Salue more hurt then heale the SORE. Be now a KING of Kings: for, Sorrowes raigne In Thee, o're whome become thou SOVERAIGNE. The more like GOD Kings be, the lesse they grieue Or ioy, for ought that ioy or griefe doth giue. For, highest pow'r in weakenesse best is showne: Than; sith no weakenesse can vphold a CROWNE, Let thy high vertue, that doth three sustaine, Represse strong griefes, that but in weakenesse raigne, The more th'affront of FATE, the more appeares The vertue of the pow'r that well it beares! No King should be (howe'r he be distrest) Lesse than him-selfe, or like him-selfe at least: But no King breathing more distrest could be Than thou hast beene, yer thou couldst breath to see Thy mortall danger: And, when, after-ward, Thy Case, by horrid treasons, was more-hard, As being in the very Mawe of DEATH, Yet, in concoction, Fate preseru'd thy BREATH. And, yet its said of thee, eu'n then thou wer't In shew, a Cæsar, and a King in Heart! Than thus being vs'd, beyond thy birth, vnto The deep'st distresse, and Seas of Sorrowes too, Say to thy Pilot Hope (in Stormes extreme) Th'hast Cæsar, and his Fortunes; go with them. Thy desprat Plight, of yore, yet safe restor'd Should make thee thinke thee safe, though ouer Borde. And thy like Sorrowes (such as Kings do kill) Should keepe out others, be they what they will. No Heauinesse that Atlas-Mind or'ethrowes, That can Heau'ns ioy vphold in worlds of woes. Nor that Herculean Spirit that can support In Hell of Ills, a Heau'n of good-report. As farre as Heauen doth Earth; nay, more by odds, Gods thoughts transcend the thoughts of mortal-gods. Then, by proportion, theirs should soare more high Than highest thoughts, not rais'd by MAIESTY. The Heart of Heau'ns great MONARCH still is free From Passion: so should SOV'RAIGNES likewise be That would be lik'st him: no Ambition higher Yet iuster farre, in deed, than in desier. But, O! i'ts easie, well, by force of Art, To prompt the sicke to Speake and Act their part; Yet, hard (most hard) to do it, after-ward: But, to highst powres should nought but Ill be hard. Seuere Torquatus, did his Sonne mis-do For charging, 'gainst his Chardge, his brauing Fo, Though he wan fame and conquest: than, sith HE That was as daring (yet was ruld by Thee) Is, for our breach of Heasts, much more deuine, Ta'ne hence, by highest Iustice, not by thine, Be thou the Patient, sith the Agent Heau'n, Thee, of thy Sonne, hath, for it selfe, bereau'n. And let no Pagan, passe a Christian, Prince, For Morall-Grace, or pious excellence! Th' all-seeing Soule of Iudgement, so long knit Vnto the actiue Body of thy Wit Knowes more then WIT can thinke to ease thy Griefe; Then let that Soule, now, animate Reliefe. And weigh, deere Soueraigne, on your Life depends, The weale of many stangers, subiects, friends: If sorrow then, should waste your Powr's of life, You soone might leaue them in a World of strife: And, make the STATE, that now you hold in peace, From Vnion, fall to Faction, peece by peece. That y'er it stand as now it doth, it may From Faction fall to Action, and decay. Then, all that are committed to your charge With Eyes, that feares and Teares do ouer-charge, On you do looke, and by those lookes say thus; Pitty your selfe if you will pity vs! And still we Hope you make a Conscience, too, Vs, in your selfe, with dolor to vndo. Sith, of you, IVSTICE, will our liues require, If through your fault, they should in Yours expire, Philip of Spaine, but for his Commons good, (So sai'd by some) to death, on his owne BLOVD Did floate his SONNE, &amp; HEIRE to al his Crowns, So, for his Subiects peace, his sonne confounds. Nay God himselfe, his deere Sonne did to death To saue his seruants: O! then, shall the BREATH By which we breathe, be spent, in SIGHES, because Thy Son, to Death, obai'd great NATVRES Lawes; When of the FOVNT of Grace, and Glory, Thou Hast such a GLASSE thy selfe to see, and know! Than, with thy selfe, thy Subiects loue thou so That, with thy selfe, thou doe them not o'rethrow Through thy much Grief (which makes them most to smart) For see'ng thy Sonne but mortall, as thou art. NATVRE (we wot) by her too wayward course, Will fal (if not vpheld by Sour'aigne force) To Grieefs redundance, for lesse CAVSE (by ods) But Kings aboue her be, sith they are Gods! Then, though thou fre'st be through the DIGNITY, Thou art most Bound to Grace, and Maiesty! When NATVRE, then, would make thee erre, as Man; Thou canst not stir from these, do what She can Vnlesse thou wilt infring the Bonds of GRACE That put, and holds thee in thy powrefull PLACE. KINGS (sacred Things) haue other Minds &amp; Hearts Than others haue, that play inferior Parts: For, some will, for their Subiects good, define! Than, for their good, wilt thou not liue with thine? Codrus, who ware th' Athenian DIADEM, Did (as thou know'st) die willingly for them. Than shall a King, inferior farre in State, In vertue passe a greater Potentate? Great God fore-fend; that HE who is so GREATE, His Subiects Hope in's pow'r should so defeate. On this Worlds stage, thou plaist Gods Part (Great KING!) And at thine Action eu'ry Eye doth fling The sharpest Beames of Obseruation! Than If thou would'st haue applause aboue a Man, Or not exposed be to base esteeme, Bee as thou Art (a God!) at least, so seeme! Be strong then (God-like KING) and act this Part Of sorrow so, as (though it mooue thy HEART) It may no Action mooue vnfit for POW'R Of greatest Brittans greatest Gouernour! God proues His throughly, y'er he them approues: So, tries before he trusts; likes y'er he loues. Yet none can take the foile, that combats WO, Vnlesse he yeelds before the Ouerthrow: For, if to fight he, but in wil, be prest Heau'n giues his courage force; his force, the best! To such, their Wish achiues that Victory Whose glory farre beyond their wish doth flie: For Grace will nere be wanting to our will, If, to our selues, Will be not wanting still. That thou retir'st thy selfe, when Heau'n doth frowne, Doth rather raise then sinck thy high renowne: For, Clossets must enclose vs, when, in Wo, We reckon with our God for what we owe. Good Kings are leaft alone, when most alone; For stilnesse is the staidnesse of their THRONE. Henry the Fourth, of France, had hee beene still; Rauilliack then, had found no King to kil. And all the World had from his WORTH, repos'd In pious acts, the better beene dispos'd: For, as a Beacon, on an hill aspir'd, Although it stand alone, yet, being fir'd, Lights the whole country, farre off from the flame, And makes Night Day-light neere vnto the same: So, solitary Kings, that are retir'd For vertuous causes, do (like Beacons fir'd) Giue light to all their Subiects, farre, and nie; So, good the publike by their priuacy. Good King, thy foes (if thou hast any such, If not; thy Sauiour could not say so much) Cannot but say (and do thine Honor right) Th'art Good, as Great; in Nature, as in Might! Than, in that goodnesse, our iust Iealousie (Of common intrest which wee haue in thee) Conuert to Confidence, through thy due care Of thy Healths state, &amp; this STATE, which we are. Thy Health is ours; thy Sicknesse is our Pest. Thy rest's our Toile; thy Trauaile is our REST! If from the Helme of this so mighty ARKE That beares our Common-wealth, in priuate Carke, Thy most wel-practiz'd HAND in rule of STATE Be long with-held, by sorrow, ease, or Fate; It must (for all the Masters helpes within) Runne back in Grace, or else quite sinck in sinne. The Masters Eye doth fat the Horse (they say) And Coyne-made-Pastors let the flock decay. Those Officers, that buy, or rent their Roomes, Will sell, or make a RENT of all that comes. All will stand crooked, if thy Head, and Hand Be not appli'd to make it vpright stand. Thou being the cunning'st Architect of STATE Canst raise this, maugree puffes of Spight or Fate, That, it (rare Master-peece of Kingly SKIL) Shall stand for Kings to imitate it, still. Then, O! take comfort in thy Common-wealth Whose comfort is in care but of thy Health. As when the sick (sore sick) are spoken too By friends for good, yet grieue in what they do: So, least my chat might thee (perhaps) offend, I at thy foot fall prostrate for the end: Regis ad exemplum. &amp;c.And thus there set the Period of my speech: Do as thou wilt, thou wilt all others teach. To the sacred Queene of England her most excellent Maiesty bee all comfort after the CROSSE. Good Queene (for, greater STILE, Truth, Grace, nor Wit Can giue to Greatnes for Mans Goodnesse fit) Blesse with thy Raies these Lines, drawne out at length To giue thy Mind, repose; thy Pati?ce, str?gth: Yet, come from want of wit, which iustly vaunts None truer speakes then truest Ignorants! You see, beneath the Circuite of the SVNNE, All that's made best, is instantly vndone! Are all things vaine then, in that Compasse? No: The lightest Thing therein, is nothing so: That's TRVTH; which stil is best; yet still vnmade: Which GOD cannot vndo, though Fiends inuade! Than TRVTH, so perfect, tels you by her Foole, (Her plainest Tongues-man) you are in a Schoole That teacheth many Lessons; good, and bad: The bad, delight; the good, but make too sad: Then, sith now sad you are, the last you learn'd Was passing good, though it be ill discern'd. You take it ill (perhaps) by so great losse, To learne to beare a farre more heauy CROSSE (Which Heau'n long deferre) if long you liue, (For which I pray) then O be glad to grieue For what you do, when you do grieue to proue Your Soules best Physick in what least you loue. “It's ill to be too well; ease, is disease: And deadly too, in Parts that Death doth seize. Then when, in any Part of vs, we ioy More than we should, lest that might vs destroy Heau'n takes it quickly off (as t'were by stealth) And, by that Want supplies our want of health! The greatest Crosse that Greatnesse then can beare Is that of Pleasure, free'd of Griefe, and Feare. Yet to content Desire, and feare exclude, Is the whole Summe of Heau'ns BEATITVDE! But, here, not so; where pleasure, as a Crime, Ends ill, if feare preuent it not in time. Yet Nature droopes, if pleasure, in a meane Sustaine it not to act Lifes tedious Scæne. Thus with, nor without pleasure, long can we Liue as we should, so strongly weake we be! Than gratious Queene when you reflect vpon This light of TRVTH, it will be daie anon With darkest PASSION, that but Reason blinds; Then leaue your Chaunce to Fame, and Fortunes winds While you your selfe repose (blow how they please) In HONORS Heau'n (or'eruling SOROWES Seas!) Wherein sits VERTVE throned, Crown'd with Stars, Aboue black Daies, made such by Clouds of Cares. There, Royall Lady, is their soueraigne SEATE, That will, in al Affronts, be Good, and Great: For, nought is Great on Earth but that Great Minde That's moou'd with nothing great produc'd by KIND! But, in an Heau'nly calme of Mindes repose, Lookes least deiected when it most doth lose. Than Mindes are Motes, vnlesse they thinke they bee Aboue all State and Fate, in their degree. VERTVE, as Soueraigne, roiall Minds still rules; But FORTVNE (as a Slaue) waites most on Fooles. This life is but a War-fare 'gainst OFFENCE; And either fortune, breeds the DIFFERENCE, Bee't Black, or Bright, its cleare, not cleare they are, From equall Danger, and from equall, Care! Soft-fortune is a Bog, or dauncing-Death, Where soone the carelesse do ingulph their breath! Then must the foote of sober-care go soft, Yet swiftly ouer, to keepe Life aloft. While high CONTENT, in what so-euer Chance, Makes the braue Minde the Starres out-countenance! CONTENT, doth feast our Fates, which stil is found In Minds, by Grace, (like Heau'n) made Great, &amp; Round: What Waue can surge aboue high'st Prouidence In Deluge of Distresse, or Eminence? What Leaden-Hap can fall from aduerse Fate, To sinke the Mind that VERTVE doth Elate? If She then CENTER be of our Defence, Be roundest Vengence the CIRCVMFERENCE It skills not; sith it shall no more annoy Than Hell the Man-god did, who there did ioy! Than, let Fates Snuffes and Puffes, as winds of Grace, despight, Serene the Heauen of your Maiestick Face From frowning Clouds, condens'd by DEATHS despight, To reaue faire VERTVES Firmament of light. So shall you mount from West of Wo to th' East Of GLORIES Heau'n; and (Sunn-like) light the rest! For, such strange Members NATVRE neuer bred As lie at ease while Thornes do Crowne their HEAD! Entombe your Passions in HIS Passion, then, (To be belou'd of Angells, prais'd of Men!) And, with a roiall-smooth-erected front Beare vp the CROSSE; and, euer looke vpon't As on the only KEY of Heau'ns fore-gate, That opes it maugree Enuy, Death, and Fate: For, Fate and Death our Nature doth salute Y'er we can breathe on Blossoms of LIFES Fruite. Then, if wee flourish afterward, it is A grace we merit not, but vse amisse. We vse amisse; or (at the best) the Best So vse it still, as all the interest Comes from the poorenesse of their Spirits, with strife; So, but in Grace, deserue the loue of Life! Yet, Spirits of richest temper, are but poore; But, in their indigence, abound with store Of Heau'nly Treasures, which the World doth scorn Yet they the brauest Minde do most adorne! A braue Spirit is a Particle of HIS That's Lord of FATE, Triumuirate of BLISSE! And, (as a Flame) she still, by Nature, sties Where her ORIGINALL reposed lies. Than, sacred Maiesty, disdaine to vaile Thy height to Nature, if shee fall to waile: Though weeping with thy Sex doth best agree; Yet Teares so drowne the Raies of Maiesty, As, through those troubled streams, when they would peepe, They, sadly, looke like Pris'ners in the deepe. But, can a Mother, good, as great, forget, A SONNE so deere, and not pay Natures Debt In Liquid Pearle, disbursed by those Eyes Where Maiesty with Loue and Vertue lies? O! no, She cannot: but She still may minde Her Sonne, in DEEDE; yet, put the SHEW behinde, Where it may neuer shadow GLORIES sight, That, in the Streames of Sorrowe, sinks her light. Now (as a foole) foole-hardy I haue beene T'incounter thus, the Passions of a QVEENE; Which commonly are strong as is the state Of those that all but them, predominate! What is my reach herein? Is it to show My Hand, or Heart, or what a foole may know? To pick her Mouth of thanks; her Purse of coyne: Or, praise (at least) from her (so charm'd) purloine. For Note, for Coate, for Countenance, for ought Like these; or none of these? or, else, for nought? For none of these it is: yet, is it not For nought; but, for Her good, I play the Sot. To make Her (Sorrie) merry, as I could, None other-wise than Grace, with Nature, would Eu'n for Her selfe: wise-folly telling me Eu'n for Her selfe, should VERTVE serued be. Than, if that one of Gods Fooles, on his Face, (Most wise in that) may beg, and haue the grace Of good acceptance of this seruice; he Will foole it, thus, for nothing, till he be Nothing, that is not some-thing, still to serue A Queene, whome Fates did for our weale reserue. Whose priuat Wombe, hath beene the Fountain-head, Whence all the Issues of our Hopes are lead. By Graces guidance, and by Natures might, Still to refresh the Red-rose, and the White, For that, and for thou, sweetest Eglantine, About the Flow'res of all our Crownes dost twine To keepe them from quite falling, (as our owne) By aduerse Puffs, that else might blow them downe. We, (mixt, conioyn'd in peace and vnity) Enshrine thee in our soules Infinitie, Till all good soules shall meete, where they shall Rise To Glory in secure FELICITIES. Here, heauy Muse, stoope low thy high ascent; And say, in deepenesse of the low'st desent: Good Queene (as it began, your STILE defines) Blesse, with your Beames of grace, these graclesse Lines. FINIS.</field>
