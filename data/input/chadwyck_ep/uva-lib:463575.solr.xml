      <field name="fulltext">The Authors Induction. Man of polluted lips, dar'st thou aspire So great a Worke? call for CÃ¦lestiall Fire, Invoke some Holy hand to guide thy Pen, Some Circumcized heart to teach thee: when Thou but conceiu'st a Verse, set'st down a line, Sigh for thy state: weepe for those sins of thine, (Those Actuall-ones) that Iustice haue call'd down And caus'd th' Almighty with an angry frowne Fright Blessednesse from thee: making thy life A Vale of Miserie, a Den of Strife, Scarce suffering thee in almost seuentie yeares See ought but dangers, mischiefes, debts, &amp; feares. Laying on thy soule such heauynesse, such woe, As but his Mercy helpe thee, thou must goe (And speedily) vnto a Graue forlorne, With Iob complayning thou wert euer borne. Oh my deiected spirit, rowse thy selfe, Be not with Care (as worldlings are with pelfe) Wholy benum'd: thy God (benigne &amp; good) Knows, eu'n for Thee, thy Sauiour shed his blood; Be thou but penitent, and he will smile; Wash thee with Teares, &amp; he with sacred Oyle Will cheere thy looks, &amp; thou shalt cleerly see The louing kindnesse he intends to thee. The Scales are falne already: I behold Diuine Infusion: (happy man) am told That his great Prouidence (neuer-forsaking) Did first excite thee to this vnder-taking: He bids thee write: rely on him, and send Thy prayers vp, and he will fairely end This thy designe, and thou shalt comfort finde Both for thy trauail'd life, and troubled minde. Led by this Fierie-Conduct, this darke night, Lo thus I wander (hopefull Israelite.) Beginning with mine owne liues-storied-truth, Which (now &amp; in my graue) may purchase ruth To see the d?gerous spurns the world hath giu? me And strange adu?tures wherto Time hath driu? me, In which, this Comfort to my selfe I'll make I neuer yet dishonest course did take; No Sirens voyce could euer me betray To th' hands of Iustice by a shamefull way: Oh no, let Enuy speake her worst (in hate) Shee can but say, I was vnfortunate. But to my story (whence I haue declin'd) Thus put I forth to Sea, heauen send faire winde. The Citie had my birth: My Father free Marchan-taylors Of a much fam'd and Royall Company, With good esteeme bore Offices of worth. My Education past; I then went forth, And tride the Ayre of diuers noble Counties, There tasted some free fauors, gen'rous Bounties, Yet could not find there (as th' euent exprest) Sufficient grounding for my foote to rest, With Noah's first Doue (after much flight, much paine) Vnto my Arke, (my Natiue home againe) I backe return'd; but could not bring with me The Oliue-leafe of faire Tranquilitie. Much variation I haue had since then, With one blest gift (a ready writers pen) The vse whereof (without vaine glory told) Is not extinguish't yet (though I am old) 'Tis not extinct indeed: But yet (alas) It's a cas'd Instrument, no sound it has: Time hath worne out (with Teares I strike this straine) Beliefe of what I can: now young ones raigne, Whil'st I (too old to cry about the street Worke for a Writer) no Imployment meet, But all dismayed, and dis-ioyfull sit As one had neither Pen, nor Hand, nor Wit: Or as Ierusalems sad famish'd Mother, Feed on mine owne begotten flesh; (no other) Quite lost; vnlesse (in this) Speed meet Desire, And hap doe answere hope. But I retire To shew the Protean-changes, and the Chances, My life hath touch'd at: as an Arrow glances, And slides from ground to ground, yet neuer hits The aymed Marke; so my vncertaine fits Obserue with patience, 'twill not hurt at all: (Experience is a doctrine medinall. First was I seuen yeares-seruant, painfull Clarke, Vnto a S?. Auth. Ashley. Clarke o'th Counsell; &amp; did marke Within the c?passe of those hopeful yeers The Goodnesse, and Nobility o'th Peeres; Those Reuerend Lords, those Councellors of State Vpon whose Vertues I must meditate While I haue breath: and in my soule adore These great Succeeders of those gone before: Heauen fix th? in their Seates: long stand they thus Like sheltring Cedars on Mount Lebanus: Their Counsels blesse: al their decrees reuown th?; Their Soueraigns honor here: There Glory crown them. Goe on my Zeale, &amp; praise, while thou art able Each gracious Second of that honour'd Table: Clerkes of the Counsel And as a thankfull Riuer that doth send His Tribute to the Ocean, I commend One speciall sacrifice (with heart sincere) Vnto his worth, whom I call'd Master here: May his In-vrned Bones in quiet rest Till the last sounding Trumpe, and then rise blest: That (haplesse) thence I slipt (wanting firme hold) I sadly sigh the fate; but leau't vntold: Onely thus much (that no aspersion bide Vpon my front) I did no talent hide. The Signet and the Priuy Seale was next Those deare Collegues, that giue me for my text A field of honour, and shall be my Song While Fame a Trumpet hath, or I a tongue: The Gentlenesse which there I did possesse Did make their goodnesse more, my sorrowes lesse: But those sweet after-drops of comfort I Sometimes receiu'd from thence, are now growne dry: Those Conduit-pipes, that did my thirst allay Are frozen vp: and now in the highway, (Poore Trauellor) wounded, and rob'd I lye, Vntill some good Samaritan come by, And with the Wine, and Oyle of Ioy agin Set me on Horsback, helpe me to some Inne. To th' Tribe of Leuy, (heau'ns chiefe Miracles) I haue done seruice; writ their Oracles, Which so Diuine Instinction doth infuse, For their bles'd sakes Ile make my soule their Muse And pray with the best power, my Zeale affords All happy Gifts to crowne their sacred words; The Holy Ghost, (in Clouen tongues, and Fire) Descend on them, when they good things desire. But most of all doth my laborious hand 'Mongst the renown'd and learned Lawyers stand A Monument; each Office and each Court Vouchsafeing me such matter of report, That if my voice to th' vtmost world could stretch Euen thither should their Fames, &amp; honors reach. And some imployment hath my vsefull Pen, Had 'mongst those ciuill well-deseruing Men, That grace the Stage with honour and delight, Of whose true honesties I much could write But will compris't (as in a Caske of Gold) Vnder the Kingly-seruice they doe hold. Lo this hath beene the Sceane that my poore life hath plaid, Happy in nothing but the Meane, whereby I ne're betray'd To Fortunes fickle Chance my Liberty and Name, For whom she neuer did aduance can neuer loose a Fame. Had I (like others) sought the top of any hill When she a Mischiefe would haue wrought, s'had had me at her will: But lying on the ground, and could now lower fall, I safely view'd the world a-round, and made some vse of all. And this I finde to be a ready way to Rest: What others doe, to heare, and see but still to say the best: Nor can I think't a sinne to haue this Tenet got, To vse the world and all therein as though I vs'd it not. But should there be a harsh obiection cast, Who hauing tride so many wayes, and past So many places: all or none of these Could me establish; oh let them but please To note what I haue heard some Merchants say, That what they'haue got on land, they'ue lost at sea, 'Twill stop the current of that crook't c?ceit And light vnto Constructions far more streight; For so (God knowes) haue I by Stormes and Floods Of Time, and sicknesse lost my Land got Goods. And for a Confirmation of the rest; One Argument how Time hath me opprest, And how th' Almighty (in his fixt decree) Hath pleas'd to lay his Tryalls vpon me, Lend patient Eare: a sad Relation 'tis A most disconsolate Parenthesis. Yet of those Soules from Pittie not exempt Excuse may purchase, for this bold attempt, And good Appliance too: Thinke of that yeare, (In Marble hearts too soone forgot, I feare; In those that haue Compassion, and Remorse It needs must sticke an euerlasting force:) That Pestilentiall yeare; that heauy Time, (A Parallel to that, which (for his Crime) Dauid selected, when he chose to lie Vnder Gods hand, and not Mans Tyrannie) Wherein depopulating sicknesse, want, And famine, (Ram-like) did their Forces plant To batter and lay leuell with the ground This City (glorious famous and renown'd) (For whom my selfe had cause ('fore many other) Much to lament, (because she was my Mother) And for whose sake (with Ionathans swift Boy) To serue her I would run with eager Ioy: She was my Nurse; but (which was worst of all) Shee (in my cradle) gaue me such a fall, That howsoeuer yeares might heale the same, Yet (with Mephibosheth) I still goe lame. This holy Place, for which the Iewes would mourne As for Ierusalem, (besieg'd, forlorne) This beauteous Temple, for which Dauid must Needes weepe, to see her honour in the dust: From whence no Child of hers (if they had power) But fled (vnkindly) lest she should deuoure (As Myriam did) the Fruit of her owne wombe, And so be both their chamber, and their Tombe, Onely some Pillars stood to keepe it vp, (The City Pretors:) Of this bitter Cup They ventur'd drinking: honour'd be their worth, That then so good examples did bring forth: But for those silly Soules, that staid behind (Either for loue, or need) they could not find (Like Noah's Doue) a place to rest their feet, But crept from lane to lane, from street to street; where naught was seen, felt, tasted, toucht or heard But Coffins, pits, Bels-knowling, things prepar'd, To drag Poore wretches, (dog-like) to the earth, And that sometimes, ere consummating death Had fully taken on them his possession, Such was the fearefull hast, such the expression Of Horrors shape: such griefe, such Tragick sights, The Sufferer feeles, and the Spectator frights; For one man to another was a Caine, No sooner met, but fearing to be slaine By him they met: take East, West, North, or South, No wind that blew, but blew death in their mouth; Vntill the bitter raging of that Stound Had laid most vnder; left but few 'boue ground: Thus, thus she was, Ã´ thus (like Iob) she sate A patient-bearer of a ruin'd state: In Sorrow, Fasting, Sack-cloth, Ashes she, Shewes as her elder sister Niniue: Nor shop nor house, naught open, but her Eyes, And those but ope to see her Miseries: Nothing was gratious in her at this time, But that she had the Grace to know her Crime, And with repentant Marie, wash in Teares Her Sauiours feet, and wipe them with her haires: Eu'n thus she was: Thus (like Iosephus) I Partooke of her distresses heauily: And though a heauenly Titus kept mee free, And (with Tobias Angell) guarded me, So that I neither had the sores, nor dyde, (For which my sacrifice of Thankes shall bide A Monument eternall:) yet (alas) I from her Markes not so exempted was, (Her Markes of Penury, Expence, and Woes) Of Debts, engagements, all heart-breaking throes; But that I still about me beare the signe, And still shall doe, till by some Power Diuine, (As this of yours) I from the same be cleer'd, My heart reuiued, and my soule re-cheer'd. So deepe: so deepe did then that Iron enter Into my Soule and so with sorrow rent her, That had I then expir'd, I scarce had found A friendly hand to lay me in the ground With decency: no (which I much desir'd) there was not one that could (for loue) be hir'd T'haue but en-sculp't vpon a peece of stone This simple Epitaph which I alone Before-hand for my selfe, had thus compos'd, And yet affect to haue it so dispos'd, That some remembrance may remaine of me By this my Swan-like, dying Elegie. Behold a wonder (Friend) oh stay and read, and make this spectacle thy President, Here buried lies a Man, that is not dead, Deaths dart was tipt with life: death then repent And cease to vaunt: Thou hast not made him bow, For (he thankes God) he neuer liu'd till now. Though City, Countrie, Court, Church, law &amp; stage I haue pass'd thorough in my Pilgrimage, Yet here I stand Fortunes Anatomie, A spectacle of Times Inconstancy: And what's to come (to keepe me from despaire) Must rise from you (great Obiects of my prayer) In you it rests to fit me (now so poore) To giue you Offrings oft, (but thus no more) Nor shall I more Egyptian bondage see, But by your Grace and Loue enfranchiz'd be: For in each Place (whereof I made report) I some haue seene, of each degree, each sort, Of each sexe too, (for eu'n my willing duties Reflected haue vpon some Female beauties) To whom my soule hath vow'd such deare affection, I shall not giue it ample satisfaction, If deaths darke night, my sight-depriued Eyes, A shaking hand, or ought else should arise Ere I had consecrated with my Name Some liuing Glory to their lasting Fame. And 'mongst all those, wh?

Nor will't (I hope) abortiue proue, or brittle Though it should come posthumately a little: Twas not my wills, but hasty times preuention, And some disasters hindred my intention: Once in a yeare sanctum sanctorum stood Open to th' Priest: Oh be you then so good Now once for all your holy holiest heart Set open wide, whil'st I (in Priest-like part) Attend your Offrings: Of the Lepers ten Ile proue the tenth, and humbly come agen And pay my vow; yea, in a way more knowne Giue double honour, to your Vertues showne: The world shall (publique) see Ile not omit The meanest Benefactor fauors it: Which done, with joy Ile sing, and sweet alacritie, Inueni portum, spes &amp; fortuna valete. Then my Herculean Pillers I will fixe, And (with Non vltra) all your honours mixe: But till my strength reach that intendiment I here addresse me to my first intent, And sing (as erst) faire Mercies seuen fold shield, a stronger one, then Aiax euer wore, Goliah's Armour could not win the field, yet with those few pibbles Dauid bore Who sung so much of Mercie and her Lore) A larger conquest was atchieu'd 'ore Fame, then could all Giant-sinners win before. Such as proue weake, and cold, Ile sigh the same, Those that shall learn her right, I thus bow to their Name. Helpe with your suppositions: think you see (which with my Soule I wish essentiall) A stately Structure, whose Materials bee of Gold of Ophir, cut substantiall Into a Holy Altars forme: with all your reuer?t Names engrau'd the Verge along: And ouer each a hou'ring Angell call vpon your Memories, and them among an old Man (on his knees) singing this gratefull Song: An Halelujah (Heauen) Hosanna in the high, Accept as it is humbly giuen with Heart, with Tongue, with Eye; View These with Mercies-store view These (O Lord) I pray, For These shew Mercy to the Poore, and wipe their Teares away. Doe thou (great God) enfold, and guide them with thy hand, That they may long (O long) behold thy Goodnesse in the Land: And as their Ioyes arise, So fix them fast for ay, And lengthen their Posterities till Sunne and Moone decay. Should Sathan or the World assault them with their stings, Oh, let their Malice ne're be horld vnto their Ruinings: But when with much Renowne th' haue finisht this lifes Story, Vpon each head Lord plant a Crowne of euerlasting Glory. Perplexed Muse, this thy Oblation done, All vn-abasht, (as I doe thee command) With this one farther Errand, goe thou on: Say to his worth now holds thee in his hand, This is my Vltimum Refugium, and My Vale vltimum: For (Lo:) I stand Like one that at our English Lotteries Hath ventur'd all he hath: (Goods, hope and land) And drawing blank, he straight sinks down &amp; dies But happing on a Lot, he loudly sounds a Prize. Say to them all, and to each seuerall man (Be he or Peere, Noble or Gentle Spirit Thou hast not yet (in This) done all thou can, (Nor all thou wilt:) for to the glorious Merit Of such, whose Entertainment shall prefer it, Thou (in a free-borne Taske) thy Pen will strip To recordate their worth: oh none deter it; Lest Fame should plucke her Tr?pet from her lip, When his Memoriall comes, &amp; his fair name 'oreslip.

Your humblest and deuoted Raph Crane. Mercies seuen Acts Corporeall. Canto 1. The Pilgrime first heares this, by MERCY sweetly read (And's will'd to write) how fit it is to giue the hungry Bread. Well may this Work ('mongst all true Christians blest) Bee plac't as a fore-runner to the rest; By night the Piller, and the Cloud by day, By which all Mercies workes may finde their way: For the sharpe sting of hunger to asswage, Being an Affliction that feeles greatest rage, Of-spring of Famine, that of plagues the Deut. 28. 17 third, Cursed for sinne in the most sacred word, By how much it appeares the bitterer griefe, The fayrer Mercy shines in the reliefe. Vnder this title Bread, comprized lies All lawfull things Man needes or can deuise; It is so great a Worke, a way so euen, To draw on vs all plentious gifts from heauen, That Christ himselfe in that in-ioyned prayer He left (to keepe our Soules in good repaire) Makes it a maine petition: thus 'tis read Giue vs this day (Ã´ Lord) our daily bread. Daily, (marke that) which thus much doth imply That we should daily vse this Charitie, Not think't enough (and so no farther seeke) If wee performe this duty once a weeke: We looke from God that he should daily feed vs, We then should daily helpe, those daily need vs. It's call'd the Staffe of Bread; 'tis of such strengh That it supports our liues to th' vtmost length. Oh wretches then, that kill those w?? might liue, 'Cause you refuse a little Bread to giue: To deny Bread much neare th' example comes Of the rich Glutton, that denide his Crums To Lazarus: the Dogs that lick'd him then (In Abrah'ms bosome now) against such men At the last generall Doome) shall barke their sin, That thus shuts Mercy out, let's Rigor in. Then to giue Bread implyes Gods work in heauen Iohn 6. 48.Since Christ (the Bread of life) was to vs giuen When we had staru'd soules: Duty bindes vs then showne To comfort the necessities of men: And while w'haue time, this Charitie must be Not leaue it to bee done (after w'are gone) By the slow bounty of anothers aid Who perhaps too (by thy example swaid) Will part from nothing till his dying day, So may thy Goodnesse be lost euery way, And tost from ones trust to anothers care, Till there be nothing to trust to, but Aire. Christ is the Bread of life: Dole then at death Is but dead Charitie: whil'st God giues breath Be thou a Giuer to those that stand in need, And with thine owne eye see the hungry feed; Then on the next, thou canst not chuse but think Feeding the staru'd, thou'lt giue the thirsty drinke. So by one step of Mercy thou'lt ascend To the full height of Goodnesse in the end Climbing the Corporeall-workes there will appeare Then, Iacobs Ladder (the Spirituall) cleere. Canto 2. Here MERCY (heau'nly wight) plac't by a Riuers brinke, Relates what 'tis (so bids him write) to giue the thirsty drinke. Another raging Enemy, (like the first) Sets vpon man (afflicted) and that's Thirst, Terror of Surfeits, and that Plague hath fell Vpon full Bowles: witnesse that wretch in hell, (Who shewes the torment best) when al his song Was but for one poore drop to coole his tongue; But Christ that fets reward to him that giues But a poore Cup of water, and relieues His Christian-Brothers want, his thirst t'appease, Held it too deare for that rich Gluttons ease. What Charity can be lesse, then to afford A Cup of water yet with Christ thy Lord It hath a rich acceptance: which shewes plaine Mans poorest Almes are not bestow'd in vaine: Marke but the blessings which are showr'd from heau? On this (the feeblest bounty can be giu?) Esay 5. 8.11 The Lord shall satisfie thy soule, in drought, Make fat thy bones, thy courage bold and stout, And like a watred Garden thou shalt grow, Nay like a spring, whose waters euer flow. Connexio. Thy Barne shall cracke with plenty (for the first) For this, thy presses with new wine shall burst. Here are two steps, if thou canst get so farre, I know thou'lt cloath Need, when thou see'st it bare. Canto 3. That 'tis a blessed thing to Cloath the naked man, MERCIE doth here diuinely sing, (and wills him write it than. He that vncouer'd the first Nakednesse Gen. 9, 21, 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. Had the first Curse from Man: w?? tongue did blesse At the same inst?r, his two other sons In whose Acts the first modest story runnes: W'are taught by Gods Law we should not withhold Our brothers Garment (his defence from cold, And call'd his Couering) which instructs vs still How well this worke is pleasing to Gods will, To Cloath the Naked: To intice vs more To this most seemely Mercy, to the poore; The Lord himselfe the first example show'd On our first Parents, whom he (naked) cloath'd. Gen. 3. 21. Humanitie instructs vs to this care, And Creatures that no name of reason beare: That gentle Bird tender and kind to man Seeing the barenesse of a Christian, Will couer him o're with leaffes, before it rest, Then sing a dirge vpon his Mossy brest Who can so dull a Charity professe, But will of all wants pitty Nakednesse; If nothing stir him vp, this onely can Gen. 3. 10.He see's his first-shame in an vn-cloath'd man. That thought (I hope) wil raise him to this deed, To which being mounted, he will still proceed, And hauing got three Steps vp, he will see In what distresse, and want poore Prisoners be. Canto 4. The Pilgrime now writes downe what MERCIE farther showes, That m? may striue to gain a Crowne by easing Prisoners woes. The more the Charitable man proceeds, Flow greater Miseries, to meet his deedes; If he looke now with Mercies melting eye Into the Gaoles, where wretched Prisoners lye, Foure Miseries ioyn'd in one, he there shall see, Hunger, thirst, barenesse, and Captiuity: He then that truely cleeres this combin'd-Griefe, Fairely sets off, foure workes in one Reliefe, This (am?gst all Afflictions) most extends When man lyes lock't both from his Meanes and Friends Sure from th' Infernall Lake 'twas first deriu'd, For so lost soules lye of all Ioyes depriu'd, Twas the most cruell Punishment indeed That euer was deuis'd, to vex true Need: To make Necessity more haplesse: want More miserable: Scarcitie more scant; As who should say we'll inuent Plagues a new, We'll bar all Means, &amp; see what heauen will doe: Such are the Mercilesse Creditors, that ioyne Misery to want: as they doe blood to Coyne, Luk. 20. 47 And deuowre widowes houses vnder colour Of long lip-praying: (making the Plague fuller) Let Prisons swallow needy soules no more, But all rich Trust-breakers that make them Poore, On this Iustice it self may boldly venture, Cleere 'hem of True-men, that great theeues may enter For now there is no roome: nor would it hold To shut vp Sheepe and Goates both in one Fold. If thou desir'st this wrong but to redresse, I'll trust thy Pitty for the Harbourlesse. Canto 5. MERCIE doth here explaine; the Pilgrime here expresse On them what Grace may raigne that Harbour Harbourlesse. This hospitable Mercy stands in need Of small incitement: It hath beene a deed So gloriously requited, that none can Deny that Succour to a Christian; If he remember how the times of old Haue beene rewarded, he will ne're grow cold: For Truth proclaimes it (then to be belieu'd) In Strangers shapes Angels haue beene receiu'd: Heb. 13. 2. Gen. 18. 2, 3, &amp;c. Gen. 19. 2, 3. So Abrahams hospitality was blest: And the like Charity in Lot expest, Which past not vnrewarded, for next Morne, From burning Sodom he was safely borne: Not he alone, but all whom he call'd his Which shewes of this great worke th' extentiue Blisse. It ends not with the Father, but runnes on, And spreads though many a Generation; Protectiuely ouer them all it houers Like Cherubs wings that the whole Altar couers: Excluding none, but such whose willing fault (In looking backe) are turn'd to Piller-salt. This were enough (from all) this Worke t'extract Seeing such Blessings purchas'd by the Act; Say we receiue not Angels, we are sure To entertaine Christ; (which is far more pure) In his afflicted Members: this too we win, Letting in Charity, we shut out Sin, And this good more: if cheerfully thou impart Thy House to Christ, hee'll come into thy heart, Then putt'st thou on all workes of blessed kindes, Thou'lt run to visite Those whom Sicknes bindes. Canto 6. On Persons sick to 'stow a Visitation kind, What Good may come, MERCIE doth show, and He to write's assigned. The motiues that should most perswade dull mindes To offices of Mercy of all kindes, Are to consider well, how like they looke To all Gods workes (the Glasse, the sacred Booke; Which shewes 'hem plainely to mans mortall eie, That he might follow 'hem more effectually: Here is a Mercie, (though it seeme a paine) Which God begins to draw vs on againe; The Sick to him, the Healthfull to the Sicke, Both for his Glory, to keepe Mercy quicke: We say of them which haue a Sicknesse on 'hem, These words, Gods Visitation is vpon 'hem: Shall not we visit whom he visits then? What worke can be a Glory more to men Then reuerently to second (yet most-free) Gods Uisitation, with our Company? To be a Uisitant there where God is chiefe, And the first Visitor, can this be griefe? Or Shame or Danger? say the last it be, Thy comfort is, the same God visites thee, And when thy health's restor'd, more care thou'lt haue Both of the Sick, and those that want a Graue. Canto 7. How God approues those giue the Dead a timely Graue, This Pilgrime both, &amp; MERCIE striue that you may knowledge haue. Gen. 23. 4. With this fit Care did Abraham first begin, And bought a Field to bury his dead in: Gen. 50. 2.And Ioseph was the first that honour gaue To the Dead Corps: Embalm'd it for the Graue: Nay God himselfe (which should moue most of al) Deut. 34. 6.Gaue Moses, in a Ualley, Buriall: More; mark the glorious promise of this truth, No blessing beares a fairer Spring, or youth In the most beautifull word: marke it agen Let it be grauen on the hearts of men Where ere thou findst the dead (haue this regard) 2 Esdr. 2, 2, 3. Take 'hem, and bury 'hem; And for Reward Ile giue thee (in this gift comes all in one) The first place in my resurrection. Tobit amidst his Precepts to his Sonne Gently warnes this (as needfull to be done) VVhen I am dead, bury me: And next of all Tobit. 4. 5. 5. (As if he scarce had spoke of buriall) Bids the same Care he of his mother haue, Whom when she dies, Seale vp in the same graue. Thus when thou hast perform'd the last request To the Corporeall workes, and Interr'd in rest: VVith a cleare Conscience, and vntroubl'd heart, Thou maist lay claime to the Spirituall part. FINIS. The 7. Corporeall and 7. Spirituall made Parallels.

Mercies seuen Acts Spirituall. Canto 1. MERCIE puts on a more celestiall face, commands the Pilgrime take a grauer Pen, For thou must write (quoth she) &amp; I must grace what only now concernes the Soules of men. First then record how good, and how direct A deed it is, The Sinner to correct. To feed the hungry, Mercies first degree, May with this first Spirituall paralleld be, For a Stray-sinners Soule, that long hath swarv'd Fr? Christ (lifes bread) may be cal'd hunger-staru'd Then to correct and turne that Soule to good Is rightly said to giue Spirituall food. So much for the Coherence; and through all The Corporeall workes, so meet Spirituall. God rebuk'd Laban, cause he did pursue Gen. 31. 42 Iacob: Christ, Paul: Paul rebuk'd Peter too Gal. 2. 11. Boldly and openly: which shewes, we ought To reprove sin in any: 'tis so taught Throughout the Word; by Law, &amp; by the Lamb Heb. 5. 7. 8.(Who (all obedient) for the obedient came.) List to the counsell of the Holy Ghost (Where dwels all Goodnesse plentifully most) Gal. 6. 1. If thy weake Brother, through temptation fall Restore him, ye that are Spirituall: So saies the Spirit of all Comforts-beautie, Which showes this worke is a Spirituall Duty Pro. 10. 17.It is a Mercy to the Soules of men And brings them to the way of life agen: One Dutie so depends vpon another He that Corrects, will sure Instruct his Brother: Coheres with that before; for he that feeds The hungrie, will giue Drinke to him that needs: 'Tis such a golden-chaine, so linck'd together In Soule, and Body, 'tis the same in either. Canto 2. T'instruct the Ignorant, what grace it brings the soule MERCIE relates; and leaue doth grant the Pilgrime to enroule. To giue the Thirstie Drinke the second Act Of Mercie corporeall is this Mercies Tract: For what is Ignorance, but the fearefull Thurst And drought of knowledg: In Gods wrath oft curst, Swearing, the Erring, and Idolatrous Brest Psal. 95. 10. 11. Should neuer enter into his faire Rest. In warrs of Ignorance, they are said to liue, Wisd. 14. 21 And fire &amp; thirst are the fair'st fruites warrs giue I giue you Milke to Drink (saith Paul) not Meat 1 Cor. 3. 2. Which shewes the faintnes of an Ignorant heat: God calls the Glory of the Ignorant, Drought: Isa. 5. 13. And like Men famish'd, their Lifes Ioyes goe-out Instruction (like a Riuer) then let in Waters the Soule, that lay eu'n parch'd with Sin: And marke their glorious Reward that do't They that to right waies turne the Wanderers foot Dan. 12. 3. Themselues (like fixed Starres who erring neuer) Shall in th' Eternall Kingdome shine for euer. 'Twas the Command Christ his Disciples gaue Mat. 28. 19. Goe teach all Nations (willing all to saue) And (what makes perfect his C?mand) Baptize, That in their Soules a heau'nly Spring might rise; Then to Instruct the Ignorant, is to giue Spirituall Drinke, by which the Soule may Liue: when Food &amp; Drink's giuen: diuine Charitie saith Counsell the doubtfull: Cloath the bare in faith Canto 3. What Comfort's due to Those, Counsels the Doubtfull Spirit, The Pilgrims Pen doth here disclose whilst MERCIE doth infer it. To cloath the Naked: (the third Step to grace) With this Spirituall worke, may ranke in place There's Nakednes in Soule (which is in Man The greatest want) when Christ is not put-on: His sufferings his Righteousnesse, his Merits Which are the vestments that adorne meeke spirits Those Soules are deck't with Graces, &amp; shine most Set with the Counsells of the holy Ghost: Then to be Doubtfull, and of hard beliefe Is miserable Nakednes: a griefe Which most needs Counsel, &amp; best powre of man, Since it first prou'd the Iewes Reiection; Rom. 11. 20 Mat. 22. 11 Faith is that wedding Robe, In which not drest We are disgrac'd, and turn'd out from the Feast; Which still confirmes the vnseemelines of doubt. Faith's call'd a Brest-plate: if we walke without, We are not onely Bare, but want Defence, 1 Thes. 5. 8. And euery Euill, knowes our Indigence: Euery Temptation woundes with the least touch; The Force though weak, the doubter helps it much And sticks in his owne Arrow: his flesh cleaues VVide ope to Ils, whose heart no Faith receiues: He that to this Soules-Succour lends a hand, Helpes to remoue this house built vpon Sand, And sets it on a Rock (his Sauiours Trust) To the next Worke of comfort he'll be iust. Canto 4. How sweete it is to lend Comfort to th' Sorrowfull, MERCIE her speech doth sweetly bend. and He doth write at full. To ransom Captiues the fourth Mercie plac'd In the first ranck, may with this worke bee grac'd There are Spirituall Captiues: when within The Soule lies geyu'd with Fetters made of Sinne, Chain'd to Despaire and Guilt of euill-Merit, To Comfort, is to Ransome such a Spirit: Or at the least to let the minde in frame With the sweet thought of their Redeemers name; (That Sacred Ransome for all penitent Men Loaden with Sorrow, for their load of Sinne) To this most beauteous Mercy, (saith Saint Paul) Gods speciall Attribute may moue vs all: The God of Comfort being Gods glorious name, 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4Whence, we receiuing Ours must giue the same To the afflicted Conscience: Ease her load With what our selues are Comforted of God. Christ in sweet words, makes knowne himselfe to be The Lord of Comfort; saying Come to me You heauie laden: what can more be nam'd, Mat. 11. 28. The Holy Ghost, hee's generally proclaim'd A Comforter: his onely worke on Earth Ioh. 14. 6. Is to raise Ioy, to meete our Second Birth: Well with a Christian may this worke agree So Star-like fix'd in the whole Trinitie. To light and guide Compassion in Mankind That the next worke it may the easier finde: He that lends pitty to Greifes mournefull Song, Patience will blesse his Soule, to beare a Wrong. Canto 5. MERCIE expresseth here: the pilgrime here sets downe How those that wrongs with Patience beare gain an eternal crown To giue to Those a harbour that haue none Was a worke Corporeall in the fifth place showne, As Patience now in this Spirituall forme Which hath a welcome for wrongs sharpest storm And to giue Iniuries house-roome is no more Then to Lodge Enemies, distress'd, and poore; which makes our Acts, the nobler in their course: And puts our Euills to the weaker force: âAs Wrath consumes it-selfe, oppos'd by none âSo Iniuries indur'd, their Stings are gone: That God, which last of Comfort held the name Rom. 15. 5.Is here the God of Patience; both the same; Rom. 2. 4.By his Long-suffering, Penitence works our Peace; Luk. 21. 19And by our Patience we our Soules possesse: Our Patience hauing a Possession then, Who should lodge there, but Iniuries of men? That place to Euills properly belongs âThe house of Patience is the Inn of Wrongs: Iam. 5. 10.The holy Prophets are before vs plac'd As precedents of Patience: but most grac'd Math. 27: 28, 29, 30, 31, &amp;c.By Christ, and his Endurings: witnesse Scornes, Reproaches, Spight, Blasphemy, Buffets, Thornes, Last, his most Pretious Suffering, that excells, And hath raisd Patience, boue all Vertues else: And for the Thorny-crowne, prickt it with Starrs, Shining through Corporeall, or Spirituall Warrs: Who would not beare wrongs since i'th end they proue All Iewells, set about their Crowne aboue? Without the next, impossible he should liue, He that beares Wrongs, will graciously forgiue. Canto 6. Vn-spleenfull MERCIE bids the Pilgrime tell with Pen, That He his soule from sinning rids that doth Forgiue all men. The Uisitation of the sick, the sixt Corporeall worke, is to this Mercy fixt: For on the Bed of sicknesse harshest men Will both Forgiue, and aske Forgiuenes then, That time, the most reuengeful spleene will melt, In teares, and not in blood, his Reuenge felt: The motiue then, to drawe this good worke on vs, Is to thinke still, that sicknesse were vpon vs: And as the worldling, when hee's sure to die, Will then giue all, no man more liberally; (For reason of his bounty, this we giue him, Because he can nor keepe, nor carry with him) So hee that's most reuengefull, most malicious, Will shew himself, in that kind, then least vitious, When Visitation like a frosty night Bindes vp the Riuers of his Blood, and Spight: If hee be good, and a right Christian, He will forgiue (as Charitie tyes man) If hee be ne'er so vild, he'l forgiue then, In that he hath no power to Iniure men. Howeuer by this blest Example liue And because Christ forgaue, let vs forgiue, For his sake honour it; and in this respect, Col. 3. 12. 13.It being the speciall marke of Gods Elect, The next will sweetly fall into thy way For hee that Pardons will be apt to pray. Canto 7. Here (lastly MERCY saies, and He doth here comprise The honour of that Soule that Praies euen for his Enemies. The Burying of the dead not disagrees With this Worke, Praying for our Enemies: For as Oblivion's said to be a Grave, And Ills forgotten, their true Buriall have: So, when we Pray for Foes, we there comprise The Funerall of all our Iniuries: Neuer in life to be remembred more, But like things Buried, seal'd, and couered-ore: This Praying loue: which makes vp Charitie best And both (faire Mercy) in this tract exprest 'Tis like a Tomb stone here ouer Deaths Inne And couers the great Multitude of Sin: Blessed Saint Stephen, thus with loud voice cride Acts 7 60. (And buryed his Foes wrongs, before he dide) Lord lay not to their charge their sin (though deep) And when hee had thus spoke, hee's said to sleepe, To shew the meeknesse of his death, and that Wrongs were no sooner pardon'd, but forgot: It is a Mercy that Christ lights vs to, Forgiue them, for they know not what they doe. Your Enemies loue. Doe well to those that spight you, Luke 6. 27. 28. Blesse them that curse, &amp; Pray for th? that smite you. 'Mongst Mercies works this shines the special Iem Both to bring wrongs to th' graue, &amp; pray for them: As Christian Charitie vseth this Remorse, Prayers are oft said ouer an Ill mans coarse (To the worlds iudgm?t) which this work implies We ought to pray eu'n for our Enemies. To do the contrary shewes the curse o'th Law, But this on vs the Gospels blisse doth draw, That Gospel, which God cals a Couenant-new; A new-Command. Christ giues it these words due, Lifes-newnesse: the New man: how well cohere May these sweet Attributes with a New-yeere? Call then the old, the Law: whose force is done. And the New-yeare, the Gospel, and Gods Sonne, The time of Grace, Redemption, Comfort, Peace, And may your Ioyes in those rich Gifts increase, That so you louing these works (both waies seuen) May shine 'mongst m?, &amp; then be Stars in heauen; In that Triumphant Citie, glorious place, So vnexpressible, so full of Grace; With such transparant Beautie deckt, so shining With all Maiesticke glory, so inclining To Blessednesse, that those which it enioy Are turn'd to Angels, freed from all annoy. Bvt here this Pilgrime staid, (alas with much distresse) He found himselfe too weakly made such Rarenesse to expresse. Therefore with humble Eyes, of that faire Citie (new Hierusalem) he prostrate lies in Contemplation true. And with him MERCY rests and gently doth commend Vnto your true compunctiue Brest, this Pilgrime to defend. And if you please t'apply some Balme vnto his Paine, The Wretch that groveling now doth lie she saies may rise againe. And on an Oaten Reed vnto Heauens glorious King For such a sanctimonious deed his Thankfulnesse out-ring. FINIS.</field>
