      <field name="fulltext">Quæ prosunt singula, multa inuant. TO THE GREAT IOY AND HOPE OF PRESENT AND FUTURE Times, Henrie, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall. Earle of the Countie Palatine of Chester, Knight of the Honourable Order of the Garter, Heyre Apparant to the Realmes of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. I. [Doe not, O doe not prize thy beauty at too high a rate] 1 Doe not, O doe not prize thy beauty at too high a rate, Loue to be lou'd whilst thou art louely, least thou loue too late, Frownes print wrincles in thy browes, At which spightfull age doth smile, Women in their froward vowes, Glorying to beguile. 2 Wert thou the onely worlds admired, thou canst loue but one, And many haue before beene lou'd, thou art not lou'd alone. Couldst thou speake with heauenly grace, Sapho might with thee compare: Blush the Roses in thy face, Rozamond was as faire. 3 Pride is the canker that consumeth beautie in her prime, They that delight in long debating feele the curse of time, All things with the time do change, That will not the time obey, Some euen to themselues seeme strange, Thorowe their owne delay. II. [Beauty sate bathing by a spring] 1 Beauty sate bathing by a spring Where fairest shades did hide her, The windes blew calme, the birds did sing, The coole streames ranne beside her, My wanton thoughtes intiste my eye To see what was forbidden, But better memory cride fie, So vaine delights were chidden. 2 Into a slumber then I fell, But fond imagination Seemed to see, but could not tell Her feature or her fashion. But euen as babes in dreames do smile And sometime fall aweeping: So I awakt as wise the while As when I fell asleeping. III. [Goe to bed sweete Muze take thy rest] 1 Goe to bed sweete Muze take thy rest, Let not thy soule bee so opprest Though shee deny thee, Shee doth but trie thee, Whether thy mind Will euer proue vnkinde: O loue is but a bitter-sweete Iest. 2 Muze not vpon her smiling lookes, Thinke that they are but baited hookes, Loue is a fancy, Loue is a Franzy, Let not a toy, Then breed thee such annoy, But leaue to looke vppon such fond bookes. 3 Learne to forget such idle toyes, Fitter for youthes, and youthfull boyes, Let not one sweete smile Thy true loue beguile, Let not a frowne For euer cast thee downe, Then sleepe and go to bed in these ioyes. IIII. [Shall I looke to ease my griefe] 1 Shall I looke to ease my griefe, No my sight is lost with eying, Shall I speake and begge reliefe, No, my voyce is hoarse with crying: What remaines, but onely dying. 2 Loue and I of late did part, But the boy my peace enuying, Like a Parthian threw his dart Backward, and did wound me flying: What remaines but onely dying. 3 She whome then I looked on, My remembrance beautifying Stayes with me, though I am gone, Gone, and at her mercy lying. What remaines but onely dying. 4 Shall I trye her thoughts and write, No, I haue no meanes of trying: If I should yet at first sight She would answere with denying. What remaines but onely dying. 5 Thus my vitall breath doth waste, And my bloud with sorrow drying, Sighes and teares, make life to last For a while, their place supplying, What remaines but onely dying. V. [What if I sped where I least expected, what shall I say? shall I lye?] 1 What if I sped where I least expected, what shall I say? shall I lye? What if I mist where I most affected, what shall I do, shall I dye? No, no, Ile haue at all, Tis as my game doth fall, If I keepe my meaning close, I may hit how ere it goes, For time &amp; I Do meane to try What hope doth lye in youth, Fa la la The minds that doubt Are in &amp; out, &amp; women flout at truth: Fa la la la la la, fa la la la la la, fa la la la, fa la la. 2 She whome aboue the skies I renowned, she whome I loued, shee, Can she leaue all in leathe drowned, can she be coy to me? Her passions are but cold:, She stands and doth beholde, She retaines her lookes estrangde, As if heauen and earth were changde. I speake she heares, I touch, she feares, Herein appeares her wit, fa la la: I catch, she flies, I hold she cries, And still denies, and yet fa la la. 3 May not a wanton looke like a woman, tell me the reason why? And if a blinde man chance of a birdes nest, must he be pratling? fye: What mortall strength can keepe, That's got as in a sleepe? The felony is his That brags of a stolne kis: For when we met, Both in a net, That Vulcan set, were hid, fa, la la la: And so god wot We did it not, Or else forgot we did. Fa la la la. VI. [Sweet if you like &amp; loue me stil] 1 Sweet if you like &amp; loue me stil, And yeeld me loue for my good wil, And do not fr? your promise start, Wh? your fair h?d gaue me your hart. If dear to you I be, As you are dear to me, Then yours I am, &amp; wil be euer, No time nor place my loue shall seuer, But faithfull still I will perseuer, Like constant Marble stone, Louing but you alone. 2 But if you fauour moe then one, (Who loues thee still, and none but thee,) If others do the haruest gaine, That's due to me for all my paine: Yet that you loue to range, And oft to chop and change. Then get you some new fangled mate: My doting loue shall turne to hate, Esteeming you (though too too late) Not worth a peble stone, Louing not me alone. VII. [Cease troubled thoughtes to sigh, or sigh your selues to death] 1 Cease troubled thoughtes to sigh, or sigh your selues to death, Or kindle not my griefe, or coole it with your breath: Let not that spirit which made me liue Seeke thus vntimely to depriue mee Of my life Vnequall strife, That breath which gaue mee beeing Should hasten mee to dying 2 Cease melting tears to streame, stop your vncessant course. Which to my sorrowes childe are like a fruitfull Nurse, From whence death liuing, comfort drawes, And I my selfe appeare the cause Of all my woe, But tis not so: For she whose beautie won mee, By falshood hath vndone mee. VIII. [Scinthia Queene of seas and lands] 1 Scinthia Queene of seas and lands, That fortune euery where c?mands, Sent forth fortune to the sea, To trye her fortune euery way: Ther did I Fortune meete, Which makes mee now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, Nor seruice to a King. 2 All the Nimphes of Theatis traine Did Scinthias fortune entertaine: Many a Iewell, many a Iem was to her fortune brought by them: Her fortune sped so well, Which makes me now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, Nor seruice to a King. 3 Fortune that it might be seene, That she did serue a royall Queene, A franke and royall hand did beare, And cast her fauoures euery where: Such toyes fell to my lot, Which makes me now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, Nor seruice to a King. IX. [Blame not my cheekes, though pale with loue they be] 1 Blame not my cheekes, though pale with loue they be, The kindly heate into my heart is flowne To cherish it that is dismaide by thee, Who art so cruell and vnstedfast growne: For nature cald for by distressed heartes, Neglects, &amp; quite forsakes the outward partes. 2 But they whose cheekes with carelesse bloud are staind, Nurse not one sparke of loue within their hearts, And when they wooe, they speake with passion faind. For their fat loue lies in their outward parts: But in their brest, where loue his Court should holde, Poore Cupid sits, and blowes his nayles for colde. X. [There is a Garden in her face] 1 There is a Garden in her face, Where Roses and white Lillies grow, A heauenly paradise is that place Wherein these pleas?t fruits do flow, There cheries grow which none can buy Till chery ripe, themselues do crye. 2 These cheries fairely do inclose Of Orient Pearle a double rowe, Which when her louely laughter showes, They looke like Rose buds fild with snowe: Yet them no Peere nor Prince may buy, Till chery ripe themselues do crye. 3 Her eyes like Angels watch them still, Her browes like bended bowes do stand Threatning with piercing shaftes to kill All that presume with eye or hand Those sacred cheries to come nie, Till chery ripe themselues do crye. XI. [Sweete loue my onely treasure] 1 Sweete loue my onely treasure, For seruice long vnfained Wherein I nought haue gained, Vouchsafe this little pleasure, To tell mee in what part My Lady keepes my heart. 2 If in her haire so slender, Like golden nets vntwined, Which fire and arte haue fined: Her thrall my hart I render For euer to abide, With lockes so daintie tide. 3 If in her eyes she bind it, Wherein that fire was framed, By which it is inflamed, I dare not looke to finde it, I onely wish it sight, To see that pleasant light. 4 But if her brest haue dained With kindnesse to receiue it, I am content to leaue it, Though death thereby were gained: Then Lady take your owne, That liues for you alone. XII. [Thinkst thou Kate to put me downe] 1 Thinkst thou Kate to put me downe With a no, or with a frowne, Since loue holds my hart in bandes, I must doe as loue commaunds 2 Loue commaundes the hands to dare, When the tongue of speech is spare: Chiefest lesson in loues Schoole Put it in aduenture foole. 3 Fooles are they that fainting flinch For a squeake, a scratch, a pinch, Womens words haue double sence: Stand away, a simple fence. 4 If thy Mistresse sweare sheele crye, Feare her not, sheele sweare and lye, Such sweet oathes no sorrowe bring Till the pricke of conscience sting. XIII. [When wil the fountain of my teares be dry] [1] When wil the fountain of my teares be dry, When will my sighs be spent: When wil desire agree to let me dye, When will thy heart relent: It is not for my life I plead, Since death the way to rest doth leade: But stay for thy consent Least thou bee discontent. 2 For if my selfe without thy leaue I kill, My Ghost will neuer rest, So hath it sworne to worke thine onely will, And holdes it euer best: For since it onely liues by thee, Over reason thou the ruler be: Then giue me leaue to dye, And shew thy power thereby. XIIII. [Flye from the world O fly thou poor distrest] Flye from the world O fly thou poor distrest, Where thy diseased sence infectes thy soule And wher thy thoghts do multiply vnrest, Trobling with wishes what they straight controule O worlde, betrayers of the mind O thoughts that guide vs being blinde Come therefore Care Conduct me to my end, And steere this shipwracke Carcase to the graue: My sighes a strong and stedfast wind will lende, Teares wet the sayles, repentance from rockes saue, Haile death, hayle death, the land I do descry, Strike sayle, go soule, rest followes them that dye. XV. [Happy he] 1 Happy he, Who to sweet home retirde Shuns glory so admirde, And to himselfe liues free Whilst he who striue w? pride to clim y? skies Fals down with foule disgrace, before he rise, 2 Let who will, The Actiue life commend, And all his trauels bend, Earth with his fame to fill. Such fame so forst, at last dyes with his death, Which life maintainde by others idle breath, 3 My delightes To dearest home confinde, Shall there make good my mind: Not Awde with fortunes spights. High trees heauen blastes, windes shake, and honors fel, When lowly plantes, long time in safetie dwell. 4 All I can My worldly strife shall be They one day, say of me, He dyde a good old man: On his sad soule, a heauy burden lies, Who knowne to all, vnknowne to himselfe dyes. XVI. [Disdaine that so doth fil me] 1 Disdaine that so doth fil me, Hath surely sworne to kill mee, And I must dye: Desire that still doth burne me, To life againe wil turne me, And liue must I O kill me th? disdain, That I may liue againe, 2 Thy lookes are life vnto me, And yet thy lookes vndoo me: O death and life: Thy smiles some rest do shew me, Thy frownes with warre orethrow me: O peace and strife: Nor life, nor death is either, Then giue me both or neither. 3 Life onely cannot ease me, Death onely cannot please me, Change is delight: I liue, that death may kill me, I dye, that life may fill me, Both day and night, If once despaire decay, Desire will weare away: XVII. [Now let her change &amp; spare not] 1 Now let her change &amp; spare not Since shee proues strange I care not, Fained loue so bewitcht my delight, That still I doted on her sight, But she is gone new delights embrasing, And my desertes disgrasing, 2 When did I erre in blindnesse, Or vexe her with vnkindnesse? If my heart did attend her alone, Why is she thus vnrimely gone? True loue abides to the day of dying, False loue is euer flying. 3 Thou false farewell for euer, Once false proues faithfull neuer: He that now so triumphes in thy loue, Shall soone my present fortunes proue: Were he as fayre as Adonis, Faith is not had where none is. XVIII. [Since first disdaine beganne to rise] 1 Since first disdaine beganne to rise And crye reuenge for spightfull wrong What erst I praisde I now despise, And thinke my loue was to too long, I treade in durt that scornefull pride Which in thy looks I haue discride Thy beautie is a painted skinne For fools to see their faces in Thine eyes that some as stars esteeme, From whence themselues, they say take light, Like to the foolish fire I deeme, That leades men to their death by night. Thy words and oathes as light as wind, And yet far lighter is thy mind: Thy friendship is a broken reed: That fales thy friends in greatest need XIX. [At her faire hands how haue I grace entreated] 1 At her faire hands how haue I grace entreated With prayers oft repeated, Yet still my loue is thwarted Heart let her goe for sheele not be conuerted Say shall she go O no, no, no, no, Shee is most faire though she be marble hearted. 2 How often haue my sighes declarde my anguish, Wherein I daily languish, yet doth she still procure it, Hart, let her go, for I cannot endure it, Say, shall shee go, O, no; no, no, no, no. Shee gaue the wound, and shee alone must cure it. 3 The trickling tears, that down my cheeks haue flowed my loue hath often shewed: yet still vnkind I proue her, Hart let her goe, for nought I do can moue her Say, shall she go, O no, no, no, no, no, Though me she hate, I cannot chuse but loue her. 4 But shall I still a true affection beare her, Which prayers, sighes, teares do shew her? And shall she still disdaine me? Heart let her goe, if they no grace can gaine me, Say, shall she goe? O no, no, no, no, no: She made me hers, and hers she will retaine me. 5 But if the loue that hath, and still doth burne me No loue at length returne me: Out of my thoughts Ile set her: Hart let her goe, O, heart I pray thee let her, Say, shall she goe? O no, no, no, no: Fixt in the heart, how can the heart forget her. 6 But if I weepe and sigh, and often wayle me, Till teares, sighes, prayers faile me, Shall yet my loue perseuer? Heart let her goe, if she will right thee neuer: Say, shall she goe? O no, no, no, no, no: Tears, sighes, prayers faile, but true loue lasteth euer. XX. [Oft haue I muz'd the cause to finde] 1 Oft haue I muz'd the cause to finde, Why loue, why loue in Ladies eyes shuld dwel, I thought because himselfe was blinde Hee lookt, that they shuld guide him wel, And sure his hope but seldome failes, For loue by Ladies eyes preuails, 2 But time at last hath taught me wit, Although I bought my wit full deare: For by her eyes my heart is hit, Deepe is the wound, though none appeare, Their glancing beames, as dartes he throwes, And sure he hath no shaftes but those. 3 I muz'd to see their eyes so bright, And little thought they had beene fire. I gaz'd vpon them with delight, But that delight hath bred desire: What better place can loue require, Then that where growe both shaftes and fire: XXI. [Now haue I leaarnd with much adoo at last] 1 Now haue I leaarnd with much adoo at last By true disdaine to kill desire: This was the marke at which I shot, so fast Vnto this height I did aspire, Proud loue now do thy worst &amp; spare not For thee &amp; all thy shaftes I care not: 2 What hast thou left wherewith to moue my minde? What life to quicken dead desire? I count thy words and oathes as light as winde, I feele no heate in all thy fire. Go change thy bow and get a stronger, Go breake thy shaftes and buy thee longer. 3 In vaine thou baitst thy hooke with beauties blaze, In vaine thy wanton eyes allure, These are but toyes for them that loue to gaze, I know what harme thy lookes procure: Some strange conceit must be deuis'd, Or thou and all thy skill despis'd.
