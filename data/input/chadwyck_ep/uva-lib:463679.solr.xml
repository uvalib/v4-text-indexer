      <field name="fulltext">To the worshipfull and true Gentleman Maister Iohn Lucas, Eternitie. Deigne (gentle Sir) to cast a willing eie Vpon the issue of an idle braine: Once (though an Eagle) stoupe vnto a Flie, Then scorn such preis, &amp; soare aloft againe. Great oddes betweene the Mowse and Lion be, And yet the Mowse as much a beast as he. Hope lifts me vp vpon her snowie wings, Chearing my thoughts with fortunate euent: Feare pulles me downe, and whispers out such things, As curb my ioyes, and make me mal-content: Saying, the bird that seemes a Swanne by night, Will prooue a wild-goose set against the light. Naithlesse, prickt on with foolish hardiment, I put into those gratious handes of thine These looser numbers: fitter to be rent, Or swept away, like deft Arachnes twine, Than to be read: yet (deerest) list a while Vnto thy Tyros Democriticke stile. In Zoilistam. He makes each mote a mount, and keepes in store A brazen penne to dash at this and that: Yet doth this currish censor see no more, Than the mashapen Owle, or doubtfull Bat. O let the man that carpes without a cause, Be caught himselfe in Momus griping Clawes. Recentibus (Salem,/Plurimum.) &amp; Salutem Absurd. Let Heraclyte do nought but crie, And put his raw-bond finger in his eie. Laugh ye: let earthie melancholie parte: It's Aqua fortis to a merrie heart. Can all your Logick prooue that matter good, That fils the mother-veyn with sickly bloud? Salt not so much your tender bosomes frets, As do the humours thrilling greefe begets. What is the reason why your faces beene So neare a kinne to Wakefield on the greene? Is't not, for that you do so seldome smile, Ne with blithe matters winter nights beguile? Is't not, because you sit in darke some nookes, And reade such vengeable and puling bookes? Go then, my rimes, with dimples in your cheekes, And chide them that they are so greene as leekes. Be ye as working pilles to purge their paine, And make them cleare complectiond once againe. Say for theyr sakes your maister tooke in hond, (Being tyed their friend with Adamantin bond) With sun-shine iest t'expell their rotten fogges, And make them dappet like pale yellow frogges. O ye no Tyrants, but of Tyros crew, Beate not my crouching meeters blacke and blew. O let your Substances be well content For to support this feeble Accident. So shall I pray with voyce articulate, That the drie Barrell may you euer hate. Each day Ile perbreake wishes more or lesse, That ye may oft be seniors of your messe. If not: and if my chickens fare not well, Which are but newly crept forth of the shell: By the fiue prÃ¦dicables I protest, That who writes nought at all, does write the best. Your matriculated cozen and fast friend Winter and Summer. T. Tyro. Tyros Roring Megge. Decad 1. Epig. 1. The Sunnes proude coursers, hauing rest their fill, Curuetted stately vp the Easterne hill. The flowring fieldes each creature did content, VVith motly coate, and goodly blandishment. The cheerefull larke sang prick-song in the aire, And yonger sheepe skipt on the face of care. Wel mought I walke, for why me thought it sinne, Not to perke forth my head, but keepe it in. Strange thing: scarce had I well a furlong gone, When as, mee seemd, I heard a pitteous mone: Ay me, t'was one wrapt in a bead mans gowne, Whose gesture shewd him freshely come to towne. Small labour lost, quoth I, to list a while To this poore gowne-mans lamentable stile. He spake: I listen'd. Lucklesse lad, said he, That am inforst this dismall day to see: Shall I that wont to make my bellie cracke, Stay here and loose the flesh from of my backe? Rather then Tyro such a change will brooke, Out at the Ropers window will he looke. I inly greeude to heare him plaine his harmes, When he infolded Dawes-crosse in his armes: And, the warme humor drizling downe his face. Bade it adew and soorthwith trudg'd apace. I like a thiese that had in ambush line, Did bid him Stand, and go with me and dine. Such dinner was lesse easie to disgest, Then greasie brew is swimming in the brest. He thought, poore soule, no harme: I, like a king, Strait led him to his Tutor in a string: VVhere the graue Agent did his part so play, That since his Patient neuer ranne away. Had he escapte, he had felt mickle losse. For Tumbling stone nere gathers cleauing mosse. He is a friend, albe he seeme a foe, That serues all nimble footed fresh-men so. Epig. 2. Lo, he the boy, whose mouth whilom did lug The slauered milke from out his mothers dug: Is now exalt to vndeserued hap, And walkes in Garment milde, and circled Cap. And strouting it along the vnknowne street, With some fantasticke Ramist doth he meet: Who can him greet and welcome him full faire All lowting low and nodding like a mare That ore her bridle wagges her wanton head. Pincht with the hungrie flies thereon bespread, He thus can say. VVelcome to Athens, gentle yonger brother: Thou maist, ere long, be comfort to thy mother, And to thy dad, and to thy grandsire too, If thou attend the wordes I shall thee shew. Be wist, and warie of that prating sect Which striues 'gainst Ramus, lest it thee infect. For tidy Peter like a pritty primmer, May well be learned ere thou go to dinner. Hee's pithie, deep, succinct, methodicall, A Cornucope, a volume all in all. But Aristotle is a ridling Sphinx, A riuer poysonous to him that drinks. Hee's blunt, vnpolisht, tedious, harsh, obscure, Fraught with vile stuffe, and sentences impure: The childe is tourn'd, and claps him on the backe, And sweares, that Ramus foes shall go to racke: Making (forsooth) a sad and solemne vow, That he will reuerence the golden Bough. When Boyes in age, or wit haue said their fill, Old Organon must be best Logike still. Epig. 3. VVhat though Albertus be a merry man, May I not take the floure, and leaue the bran? Let him be baudie (as he is indeed) May I not choose the flower, and scorne the weed? What though vnseemly secrets he disclose, May I not hide mine eyes, and stop my nose? Great All-beard, rough with thy luxurious hide, Ile be thy scholer whatsoe're betide. Ile be Acute, and Graue, and Circumflex In the deepe dealings of the female sex. And yet I will not. What? shall Tyro be A Prentice to the trade of midwiferie? Hence bolde bad Albert, pleasing baite of sinne. Bellowes of lust to him that reades the rein. I would not for a pecke of Tagus sand, My Tutour had espyed thee in my hand. I rest thy foe, deferring thy damnation, But till I make a Theame or Declamation. Epig. 4 O grosse! O monstrous! fie, Tom Tiro, fie: Giue thy king Edwards shilling for a pie, And then transport it to thy den alone, And chop it vp, and giue thy fellowes none? What? spoile a Neats-foote, and a marrow-bon, And neuer call thy next Vcalegon? Fie that thy greedy-wormed tong is such; Fie that thy chopping kniues can mince so much. Art thou a Milo, or Philoxenus, That art so sturdie and delicious? Th'HarpyÃ¦ would not snatch so greedily, Whose talons were of great capacity. How can thy noddle choose but be so dull. When capon-like thy maw is cramd so full? Right well I wot thou maist haue lighter hart; If this thou leaue, and learne to size a part. Epig. 5. VVhat is he vnder heauens inammeld vault, That liueth spotlesse, and deuoide of fault? Where is the soule contain'd in brickle wall That standes so firmely that she cannot fall? Venus was debonaire, and beauties grace, And yet a mole lay sleeping on her face. Faire are the sphears wherein the Planets bin, And yet colde Saturne claimes a place therein. No meruaile then though Tyro haue some blot, Sith perfect vertue fals to no mans lot. Tyro can strike the sitterns siluer string, And to the lute full many a dittie sing. Tyro can act and if he like the Stage, Hop like a Bull-finch in a Barbers cage. Yet when he solde his Ãlian at the stall, Had not the villaine almost sham'd vs al? Would not the drowsie dormouse haue bin hang'd, That slept till ten a clocke and then was Stang'd? O faults! no faultes, but trickes of gentle kinde, And Proper adiuncts to a youthfull minde. Epig. 6 Ho: weepe rose-water, spit tart viniger: Tyro is waxt a ruffling Caualiere. Mount vp ye mil-st?es: heauens come kisse your centre: Tyro can strike a die staike dead, and enter. Ye toothlesse sheepe, go teare your howling foes: Tyro is ietting in his Bag-pipe hose. Xanthus, good Xanthus, turne thy posting streame: Tyro annoynts his nose with clowted creame, The drunken colour thence away to wipe, Bred with the fumes of the Tabacco pipe. Natures whole workemanship, forsake thy kinde: Tyros round breeches haue a cliffe behinde: And that same perking Longitude before, Which for a pin-case antique plowmen wore, Nor hath he siluer faces in his purse, On this superfluous trumpry to disburse: Nor hath he skill in Magickes damned spell, To raise some golden diuell out of hell. But who the man that treades on licourd shooe, Or could beleeue, or dreame that this was true? Tyro was wont to leade so staid a life, That sage Sobrietie was thought his wife. The gracelesse gallant with the crisped lockes. Was worse to him than any nine-hold stockes. The painted paper, and the swearing die, Were ghastly Night-crowes to his single eie. The witherd leafe that is in such request He would not ken but did the name detest. His Slops were spruce, and stucke so neare the skin. That one might hardly part them with a pin. Tyro decayes in good, but thriues in ill: Prowde as a Beacon on a Forrest hill. Epig. 7. Looke how a Horseleech, or back-biting flea, Sticks to the skinne, ne can be got away, Vntill her panch be tympanized so. That she must either burft, or else crie who: So bookish Tyro cleaues vnto his tunne, Vntill his houre-glasse be twelue times runne, And till his Common sence, and Phantasie, And Vnderstanding part yglutted bee: Two yoke of Oxen and a mare before, Can hardly draw him to his studie dore. I dare auerre he felt no sweete-breatht aire, Since the Red Bull drew weights at Sturbridge faire. Lo what it is that makes him languish still, Like a crow-troden hen that makes her will. Lo here the proper cause as I suppose, Why wormes digge parsnips in his dunged nose. Faith, Tyro, you and I must plucke a crow, If you go on to spoyle your carcasse so. Epig. 8. Tyro by chance did reade, that Generation Was the sole finall cause of Augmentation. Eft soones he shooke the hand with single life, And set his wit on renters for a wife. He tooke his quill, and pend this kindly plaint, Vnto a mincing minion fine, and daint. O thou Eclipticke lyne, wherein the sunne Of my felicitie doth dayly runne: Eye-pleasing obiect, hunnie-succle sweete, Tyro thy vassall tumbles at thy feete: He a Leander, readie for thy sake, To passe an Hellespont of paine and ake. Be thou a Hero standing on the shore With open armes, and claspe him more and more. Thou shalt perceiue, 'so be thy loue be wonne, I am not Snow to melt against the sunne. My bleered eyes shall steepe themselues in teares, Till some milde answer ventilate my feares. Ah, dearest Nimph, some light-foote lackie send With white, and blacke, to giue me life, or end. Roses are in thy lips, O hellish smart, If angrie nettles grow vpon thy heart. Farewell thou prettie Mop, and me remember, Written in haste the twentith of December, About the dinner houre of Eleuen, 1597 Tyro, thy Delphicke sword til Crowes be old, Til Ister be luke-warme, and Ganges cold. Epig. 9. Shee read and writ, I did my selfe much wrong, To view the weeping accents of thy song. Thy lines the foes that sought my Fort to win, Mine eyes the traytours that haue let them in. Tyro, my all in all: alacke, how can Seely weake virgin chuse but loue a man? Nor can drie tinder stony fire withstand, Nor straw the ieat, nor I thy faire demaund. But, bonny Boy, the pillar of my ioy, How canst thou shunne thy imminent annoy? All wert thou Homer, famous Poets pride, And th'Heliconian Ladies by thy side: Yet, sith thou want'st the worlds pale-colour'd Queene, I may not haue my kind affection seene. Adde wealth to wit, for, if thou faile in this, We must not bathe our selues in Salmacis: That I am forst to ring this heauie knell, I can but greeue, and so I shall. Farewell. Epig. 10. The lad replide: Were I an Alcumist, Earths yellow excrement should fill thy fist. Base-minded thing, shall asses trapt in gold Haue free accesse, while I the candle hold? O tree! O blocke! O stone, if still I stand, And see my nosegay worne in clownish hand. What Iacke? Anon sir. Saddle me my nag, New-Market heath affoords a man a bag: My Atalanta will runne on too fast, Vnlesse some Golden Apples I her cast. No, maiden, no, my liuer's not so hot, As to compell me loue, if you loue not. And yet (regardlesse of thy selfe and me,) How darst thou marre so sweete a symphonie? Say truely, am I a Sardanapale? Thou knowst thy seeming vertues were my stale. No Night-flie I, to dallie in the flame, Til I be scorcht, and shamefully fall lame. The more thy sinne to shew thy selfe vniust To him, whose kindnes was no kinne to lust. In vaine I champe the bit: no Ouids art, No Nestors tongue can riue thy flintie heart. Then sinke thou, swim thou, liue, or die, all's one, Who would be yokt, when he may liue alone? Be wed to home-spunne russet coate, or blew, To both, to neither, what care I? Adew. Decad 2. Epig. 1. A threed-bare prouerbe, Youth must haue a swing, For greener age flies with a wanton wing. It was the sober season of the yeare, When Pisces and Aquarius dominiere, It's cleaped Lent. Tom Tyros itching legges Aduertisde him to take his leaue of egges, And get him flesh. The rake-hell strain'd his wit, To compasse rost meate for the naked spit. He gat him gone vnto a neighbour towne, To see what pullen stragled vp and downe: He went a thousand paces long and tall, Ere he could spie one bird Domesticall: At last he cast his eye vpon a gander, That from his fellowes new began to wander: He threw, and hat, and made a deadly hole, In the true keeper of the Capitole. An old old Beldame plodded there along, Whose teeth did waggle faster then her tongue: He ranne, she followed with a yelling sound, And tucked vp her dirtie sauegard round. But Tyro floated on the beaten way, Like a swift vessell on the yeelding sea: She faire and softly walkt in pausing moode, And tract the felon by the Ganders blood. The ruddie sunne forsooke our Hemispheare, When she the wilie fox approached neere. The new-faln droppes led this olde bloud-hound hie, To an out-chamber, where she did espie &amp;c. The heauie accidents that then befell My merry Muse may not abide to tell. Yet thus much: Tyro stampt, and fret, and swore, Neuer to prey on foolish goose-flesh more. Epig. 2. Tyro the dastard needs would learne to swim: Yet durst he not come nie the riuers brim. He saw the tempting grauell through the cleere, And yet he trembled like the heartles deere. Pleasure a spur, and Danger was a reyne, That prickt him forward, this did him deteyne. But goodly well anon he can deuise To checke himselfe for shamefull cowardize. Crauen, he saies, pluck vp thy fainting heart: Albe thou want renowned Digbies art, Or swift PalÃ¦mons matchles facultie, Yet mayest thou wade withouten ieopardie. O minde degenerate, what needst thou feare? Proud Thamis dashing sourges are not heere. False-harted lad, go cut the cristall waue, Fortune is with them that stout courage haue. He laide him downe, and gan to be so bolde, As feele the water whether hot, or colde: Whether his head went first, the truth to tell, I weene not certainly, but in he fell. Let not the foote my tender shin-bon punch, Whose dayly burthen gaue so loude a lunch. Was neuer liuing eye saw finer tree, His head the roote, his legges the branches bee. But the milde streame was loath to let him die, And set him on his ten toes by and by. He hid his chilling bare, and home he went, And lay bed-ridden till sixe weekes were spent, Since when he wisht the reason might be found, How chance diue-dappers liue so long vndrownd. Epig. 3. Bvt ah, what meant I to forbeare this while, To tell of Tyros Steeple-climing stile? Had sweete-lipt Tully slaunting Tyro seene, Cratippus had not his sonnes Tutor beene: Had mightie Philip knowne this wittie elfe, Platos great scholler might haue hang'd himselfe. The greater beare, and the still-standing light He can demonstrate in a winter night. And yet (I blush) three loaues of horses bread Set bolt-vpright, are leuell with his head. Time was when he that did the credite win, Had store of excrement vpon his chin. Now he that looketh with a visage graue, Is hight a blocke, a stocke, a knaue, a slaue. Time was, (and then it was the time of ioyes,) When men were men, and prating lads were boies. Epig. 4. All white, all white: T'was uoisde amidst the streetes, That lechers two stood vp in sinfull sheets. When Tyro knew the tydings to be stale, He vp and told this prettie Poets tale. Iunos lewd Husband sleeping in the night, Begot a diuell that Agdistis hight. This beastly barne was an Hermaphrodite, And not his fellow-diuelles fauourite. Wherefore the hel-hounds menaced amaine, To prune the worthier member of the twaine. The deede made good the word: without delay They cut it off, and threw it quite away. The needelesse part (forsooth) was presently Transmewd into a fruitfull Almon-tree. Heer's all. If leachers might such haruest reape, Then Almon-butter would be better cheape. Epig. 5. The Lap-wing, when her nest is nothing neere, Deludes the boy, and cries, Its here, its here: So Tyro. Deest fortasse quippiam. Epig. 6. Merry it was, when Tyro in a throng, Thus praysed Cherilus for skill in song. Well sang the Bird that neuer sings amisse, The Vocall musicke most delightfvll is. When Cherils throate is swild with butterd beare, He Syren-like inchaunts the tune-full eare. Nay further, hee's the Nightingale alone, That sings a Triple, or a three to one. At large or long he will not come behinde, So he may rest, for feare he loose his wind. He can be breefe, ne thinks he it a crime To sing a common song in minym time. Cherils estate has bene at, ha now, ha, Ere since he vsde vt, re, mi fa, sol, la. Epig. 7. When Tyro sawe faire pictur'd in a booke The gilt-hornd hart that swift Alcides tooke, He tolde the standers by, he would not rest, Vntill he caught a Swallow (in her nest.) Epig. 8. The wilfull Papist could not Syllogize, Yet, in his owne conceit, he only wise. A very verbal youth, yet, like a man, He magnified his father Campian. Then Tyro thus. Not Bellarmine the prim-rose of your sect, With all his Sophistrie can me infect. Nor Stapleton, that goodly branch of thyme Whereon the Roman bees delight to clime. Sir boy: know that my gall doth grate for teen, That thy poore shankes with Ringes molested been. Rings with a vengeance, for they cry clinke, clincke, Yet when they come toth' brooke, they wil not drinke. Now by Saint Tan thy tortled rings do shew That olden Poets sober sawes be trew. For why, beneath thy knees cast but an eye, And there our Yron Age thou shalt espie. Blamst thou thy rings? thou doest them wrong I wis: A Circle the most perfect figure is. If by a right lyne thou doe downward slide, And the Tyburnian Triangle diuide, The Maxime will prooue, sound. Wel, sirrah, mend, And saue your selfe from such a doggish end. Epig. 9. A noble Student had a hauke at mew, And Robin Falc'ner for a weeke or two Must needs be absent: so the bird must die. It Tyro looke not to her carefully. The wagge was loth, yet daring not say no, He saide, good Robin, tell me, ere thou go, What diet she does vse: now welaway, Whether worms, or curdes be best I cannot say. The Faulc'ner smil'd, and askt him if he iested, And giuing Cut the rowell, him requested To giue each meale a pigeon all but bones. And pepper her, and see shee want no stones. He gon, Tom Tyro looked all about, And seeing nought but trees, these wordes burst out. Stones? pepper? pigeons? pigeons? pepper? stones? Faulcones six dishes, and I liue with bones? Study, bookes, papers, burne you al in one: Who buyes all Tully? take it: Ile be gone. Yet ere I iournie Ile go see the Kyte: Come, come bird, come: pox on you, can you mute? I now conuaie my selfe incontinent To'th shambles for this vermins nourishment. Butcher, and freind: I pray thee let me see A Bull, or Tup, or Oxe-calfe presently, And cut his hangers off: pepper and these The only fare that will a Faulcon please. Wo ho: fall too: no pigeons can be got But I haue bought thee better meate I wot. Eate lesser bittes, for, if your haukeship choke, My gowne and twelue pence for an honest cloke. Epig. 10. Mounting Elpenor had a simple fall, His braines were onely dasht against a wall And Icarus that hieaspiring slaue, Had but his corps sowst in a water graue. Tyro, a word: lift not thy chinne so hie: Tis shame that thy pen-featherd Muse should flie. Were I as dumbe as a Seryphian frogge, My signes should tell what doth my stomacke clogge. Rather than at thy foolerie Ile winke, My nose shall be my penne, the droppings inke. Finis. Sunt, Ã´ sunt iurgia tanti? To the Reader. Mishapen does mishapen stand, And craues Correction at thy hand. In the Inuectiue 'gainst the Daw That makes a mil-post of a straw, At the fourth line, is to be seene The Beast: and so, God saue the Queene.</field>
