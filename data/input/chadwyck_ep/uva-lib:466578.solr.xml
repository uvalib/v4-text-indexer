      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF MOIRA, BARONESS HASTINGS, &amp;c. &amp;c A MUSE, long versant in ideal things, That us'd to feel her youthful fancy glow, With scenes, unreal as the gaudy bow, Wild dreams of glorious deeds which fancy flings Across her woodland range, with weary wings Forsakes the fairy world, and loves to gaze Where virtue charms the view, with genuine grace Nor, tho' allied to heroes and to kings Needs the superfluous boon, with borrowed rays To gain respect, O would she deign to view These wild-wood flowrets, with a fav'ring eye Her smile would stamp renown, and wake anew My feeble voice a loftier pitch to try. Killiegh, 2d Dec. 1793. TO THE REV. EDWARD BERWICK, ON HIS GOING TO RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY. Berwick! we little thought, when first we drew The social lot from Alma's fostering hand That you were chos'n to lead the youthful crew A fearless pilot, to the lonely strand Where honour dwells: while by the muse trepan'd And o'er the wild by beck'ning phantoms led I'm doom'd to wander still in fairy land By visions tended, and in visions fed! And thou art sent an humble crook to sway Thy virtues all eclipsed in rural shade! Yet heaven retains the glow of parting day Even when the sun in Thetis lap is laid So thy example lives! Nor thou disdain The lowly duties of the quiet fold The sun, whose glories float along the main When Venice. Adrias dawning towers are ting'd with gold With more effect the winding slope illumes Where, flush'd with genial life the future vintage blooms. THE HELOTS. A TRAGEDY. THE HELOTS. A TRAGEDY. ARGUMENT. The Messenians had, at an early period of their history, been conquered and enslaved by the Spartans. The remains of the nation (except one large body, which had escaped the devastation, and settled on the shore of the Crissæan Gulph, to the north of Peloponnesus) were incorporated with the old inhabitants of Laconia or Lacedæmon, who were now in a state of servitude under the general name of Helots. During the progress of the Peloponnesian war, between the Spartans and Athenians, the Helots, stimulated by the inhuman treatment of their masters, It is well known that the Spartans encouraged their young men, to waylay, and massacre the Helots by night, in order to train them for military expeditions. and encouraged by the distress of the Spartans, resolved to make an attempt to regain their liberty, or, at least, to secure better treatment. The fears of the Lacedeamonians, which had induced them to relax their old sanguinary laws; and the secret intimations of assistance given by the Athenians, contributed to their encouragement. At this crisis, the action of the following poem begins,—the concluding circumstance is taken from Thucydeles. PERSONS. High Priest of Apollo. Aristodemus Chief Helot Alcander Chief Helot Philemon Chief Helot Amphidamas Chief Helot Phorbas Chief Helot Memnon, a supposed Persian captive, overseer of the Helots. Phæbidas, a Spartan. Alcebiades, an Athenian Ambassador. Helots. Semanthe, daughter to Aristodemus, the chief of the Helots. ACT I. SCENE I Scene—A Wood near Amyclæ in Laconia. AMPHIDAMAS and DYMAS—two Helots. Amph. What! Memnon told you!—Memnon! Sparta's spy! Messenia's scourge! and will you trust to him? A fabler! a barbarian! Slave of slaves! Long galled by Persian bondage, and in scorn Set over us, to aggravate our wrongs, With the last insult to the Grecian name? He told you that a casual quarrel caus'd This cruel stroke that lops our strength away! What was the circumstance? Repeat the tale! And then, observe my comment! Dym. What I heard Carries its own conviction on its face; Nor would our magistrates at such a time, Like gray-hair'd ideots, break in wanton sport The laws themselves had made. Alcander's doom (Ever lamented by Messenia's sons) Rose from a casual quarrel, in the fane Of Jove's immortal daughters. There, at noon, When midst ascending fumes, the swelling hymn Roll'd in long plaudits round the awful dome, The fierce Androcles saw Alcander nigh, Listning the chorus; and inflam'd with rage At the intrusion of a branded slave Amid the rites of freemen, in a tone Of mingled rage and scorn, address'd the youth; Who, too incautious, or inflam'd by wrongs, Retorted with like scorn. The brother, then, Of proud Androcles interpos'd to soothe His rising rancour, and a transient calm Promis'd fallacious peace, but night beheld His smother'd passions kindle like the fires That promise future tempest. By the moon The savage trac'd his noble prey along, Even to his native woods, and struck the blow. Amph. Time will detect the falsehood, or confirm Its truth. If our proud masters meant to shew Respect to their own laws, the legal sword Had punish'd the assassin. Dym. This is certain, Androcles has absconded; or (at least, As Fame reports,) he has not since appear'd.— Amph. I trust no rumours; what I clearly know, That I'll believe. But Rumour is suborn'd (I fear) to soothe us in deceitful calm. Spite of surrounding foes, and rude alarms; Some dreadful machination is on foot Some baneful damp, to quench the rising flame Of Liberty, that kindles thro' our bands. Else why, with all this semblance of regard, This sanctimonious face of sympathy, Why, when the council met to change the law For our relief, was midnight nam'd the hour Of dark decision? Why did they select The Temple of the Furies for the seat Of counsel? Did Humanity's soft laws E'er take their birth from these detested walls? Why were the Helot's try'd and constant friends Excluded from the dark divan? And why Are all Messenia's friends, where'er they rul'd, In Lacedeamon's martial bands, cashier'd, Despoil'd, at once, of all their crested pride, And, in their room, our most inveterate foes, The gloomiest bigots of their cruel code Promoted? Say, my friend, are these the signs Of lasting league, of amity, and peace? Dym. Be calm—methought I heard a rustling noise At hand—I would not wish your words were heard. My ear was not deceiv'd—'tis Memnon's self— He must not find us here! Amph. I wish it not. Of all the proud surveyors of our toils, Tho' some are more imperious, none I dread Nor hate so much as him, yet know not why. Exeunt. SCENE II. Scene continues. Enter ASPASIA in the Character of MEMNON. Asp. Ye kindred spirits! oft within those groves Your tears of old for our repeated wrongs, Perhaps, have fallen. But fate, with iron hand, Long since has dry'd those tears, and laid the sigh That in those glades rose frequent! still indeed Perhaps, even in the blest Elysian plains Ye mourn the fair occasion, ever lost, When to the tomb ye sunk without a name! I too could mourn like you, could wander on Inglorious thro' those groves, and wail my lot. —But I disdain this lot.—I too must fall Like you; but whether lapse of lingering years Shall lay me low, or some auspicious hour Devote me for a people, on myself Depends! I was not born to die a slave.— And now the deed is done which lifts my name Conspicuous to the nations. Hence—away Vile habit! Stern Androcles' bloody steel That laid the blooming Helot low, denies Concealment! Like the flash that fires the dome Of some proud temple, and discloses wide The solemn shrine that holds the guardian god, This blow detects me to their wond'ring tribes. This is no common fate, like those who fell Ignobly doom'd beneath the conscious night To try the temper of a stripling's steel! No Bacchanalian chorus wakes the groves, No festal dance, no rural song! 'Tis rage, Revenge, and loud rebellion! Let it come. This arm shall point the lightning on the heads Of our proud despots! This is near the spot, Where, nightly, their divan the seniors hold; There, in the moment, when their passions mount In due ferment, my skilful hand shall throw The last ingredient in, that bids them blaze, Till in the billowy conflagration caught, Yon haughty walls subside. What I have told Has rais'd their wonder at my skill, that seems Far, far above the sublunary range Of human comprehension. Could I see The afflicted father, ere the assembly meets The train were surer laid. And lo! he comes; See! where he wanders like a stricken deer, The barbed shaft deep rankling in his side! Yet thro' the cloud of sorrow that o'er-hangs His brow, vindictive rage, with transient gleam Illumes his reverend visage. Here I'll shrowd; Still somewhat, even from him, may yet be learn'd [Retires. Enter ARISTODEMUS. Arist. Then all my vigilance, my cares were vain, To check thy daring soul. Poor youth! I ought, (If I had priz'd thy life) with double seal The secret to have kept within my breast, Untold even by a look. But that pure flame, Deriv'd from him whose ashes slumber here, Had mark'd thee out some prowling Spartan's prey, And thou had'st fallen as now. In other realms, When partial Heaven awakes the patriot fire, It leads the blest possessor on to fame, And kindles in the course! But here, alas! It blasts the owner, as a bolt from Heaven, And sets in blood! But let the vengeance come, I have deserv'd it well! In every chance And change of sad disaster, which befell Our toiling tribes, when every night was mark'd With blood, each day with violence and wrong, I scap'd till now! I never felt at home Till now! Oh, injur'd people! I, your lord, For whom your dearest blood, if I requir'd, Had stream'd, was too, too timid, too remiss, Too patient, selfish, cold! Or if I felt, 'Twas not for you I felt, but for my son!— I fear'd, I strove to ward his doom in vain, But Fate has reach'd him now! O had his blood, From gallant Aristomenes deriv'd, Bedew'd some glorious field, I then had smil'd Upon my boy's distinguish'd tomb! But now He falls in blooming youth, yet falls in vain, Like some unwarlike savage to his den, Trac'd by the pack that snuff the tainted gale, And hunt him to his covert. But shall I— —Shame to the blood of Aristomenes!— Shall I, thus like a woman, wail his loss, And say, he fell in vain? No—not in vain While I survive! What tho' the frost of age Congeal my blood, my tongue that us'd to preach Patience, shall trumpet now revenge and slaughter; I have a son to tremble for no more! Then rouse, ye quiet groves! Rebellion! come. Awake! Sedition! Haste! ye gathering storms, I'll point you to your prey! Alcander's blood Has wash'd away my fears! Why should I linger Thus on the trembling verge of life, while rage— Athens—Messenia—and immortal fame, Marshall me on to glory!— [To him. Enter Memnon in a Persian habit. Arist. What art thou? Art thou the soul of my brave ancestor That comes to check my rage, or fan the flame? Aerial visitant! Thou seest a man Who dares to hear, whate'er thou dar'st to tell, And execute whate'er thou bidst. Memn. Aside. He thinks me A spirit or a god, the midnight gloom Favours the thought. He shall not know me yet. [To Aristodemus. Whate'er I am, it is not mine to tell.— But persevere! the gods are on thy side, And favour freedom! I am sent to warm Your bands with new desires, and give the glow That lifts the slave to manhood; think not then, That mangled form, which soon, with pious rites, Thy slaves shall carry to the funeral pile, Thy son! His better part survives, and walks From soul to soul, with unseen steps, but not Unfelt. Observe his motions, and adore His holy footsteps! He will lead you on To certain conquest! Fare thee well, and prosper. [Exit. Arist. Is it even so!—Why, then, lamented youth! Those eyes no more, with weak, effeminate drops, Mean to profane thy glorious fall! Thou setst And setst in blood! But, like the lamp of day, That rises on the vernal morn, and brings The zephyrs in his train for the rude blast That swept the summer buds away, thou livest, As ere few suns decline, the world shall know! To him MEMNON again—PHILEMON and other Chiefs of the Helots. Phil. to Mem. Thou hast astonish'd us! Where couldst thou learn That Dorian dialect of perfect phrase. Thou seem'st a native here! Could'st thou have gain'd In Asia's melting climes among the hordes Of willing slaves, such hardihood of thought, Such glowing sentiments, as seem to shame Athens, in all her independent pride? Forgive us, if we doubt. Arist. Aside. Is this the form So lately seen by me? Phil. Thou seest us to the verge of ruin led, Our recent hope of independence quench'd, When brave Alcander fell. On Sparta's lords Thou art dependant. Thou, perhaps, suborn'd By them, the ready minion of their will, Employ'st thy supple arts, thy fair pretext Of generous sentiments to probe our hearts, To try, if yet we feel; if aught remains, Aught, not to be extinguish'd by our tears, Aught yet unquell'd beneath the weight of woe, Ready once more to catch the falling spark And flame for liberty. We are not now So lost to prudence, as to fall a prey To such low machinations. Mem. That you doubt My own assertions, till my proofs are given To clear my conduct, no resentment breeds In me, Philemon! nor suppose I scorn To choose thee umpire of the test I bring, When to this reverend sire I now appeal, With grief deprest; yet still in him survives Messenia's latest most endearing hope, Scorning the frowns of Fate. Arist. O mock us not With hopes! But why encroach upon the hour Of sympathizing sorrow? Can you raise The dead? Can you restore my gallant son? Why didst thou, like a vision, come even now, (For well I know 'twas thou, whom late I saw) With mystic words to raise fallacious hope? Say, Persian! do your native plains produce Balm to the bleeding heart? You rather came, I fear, with poison to foment the wound! Yet pay some reverence to paternal woes! Retire, and ye, my friends! let me entreat Your absence, till the funeral rites begin! Mem. Be sorrow sacred. But, remember, sire, To sorrow like a man! This woman's dew But ill becomes the old, imperial stem Of fallen Messenia! Arist. Who informed thee! say! [Surprized. Mem. The same who told Of things unknown to human ears, but mine, Yet known in other worlds, where those, whose dust In this long consecrated mold repose, This instant are consulting on the doom Of old Messenia. Arist. Ha! thou startst a thought Might wake the dead! Who slumbers here? Unfold! Some know the secret, but to alien ears It is a secret still. Mem. Beneath this mold Slumbers the last of your imperial line, Who follow'd down Eurotas plaintive stream With desolation, fell revenge, and blood, For Sparta's wrongs! I need not add his name!— Arist. Here sleeps the dust of Aristomenes! Amazement. Who informed thee? Mem. First declare Whether I guess the number of the kings That rest around their great progenitor On everlasting guard, like yonder stars That circle round the pole! Arist. What number, say! Mem. The number equals the celestial choir Of Jove's harmonious daughters! Arist. Heaven and earth!— Some god or demon told thee! Mem. Now recall From memory's dormant stores, if e'er thou heardst An uncouth saw, by antient prophet's sung What should befall the tenth, if still he kept His ancient regal honours unprofan'd By Hope, by Interest, or by Fear! Arist. To him Was the revival of Messenia's hopes Assur'd; and hence, alas! my sad despair, Since my Alcander's loss! To him I gave My right! Mem. Despair not yet, there still remains The tenth—thou liv'st for vengeance! Others still Of the Herculean line survive, by thee To be adopted. Rouse to vengeance! Rouse! The frozen snake at Spring's reviving breath Feels the return of life! Phil. Unequall'd man! Heaven's favourite! Yet vouchsafe another glimpse Of heaven's eternal counsels (if 'tis given To mortal minds to know), why did the powers Above, permit the spirit of the state So long to dream away the rolling years And why that mystic number chosen, that seems A ninefold charm? Mem. Young man, you aim aright! It is a ninefold charm: The holy choir Of Pindus Fount, The Muses worshipped at Sparta. the lovely guardians still Of Sparta's throne, with everlasting prayer Long wearied their immortal sire, to grant Each one, thy thrones depression, till the Fates Had nine times spun the long empurpled thread For nine of thine imperial ancestry, From Aristomenes to thee deriv'd— Each gain'd a royal sacrifice, a life Of old Messenia's line, so long to save Their favour'd Lacedæmon. Pheron fell The last, thy royal sire! Arist. By all the gods Then there are hopes! had not Alcander fallen! Mem. Mistaken man! thy son's lamented fall Is life to old Messenia's cause! Arist. Explain, Thou more than prophet! even the beating storm Much more the tempest of the mind would calm To hear thee ope the mysteries of heaven!— How is the state advantag'd by the blood Of fallen Alcander? Mem. Much afflicted sire! Be it thy consolation to be told Thy son was summon'd by the awful call Of providence, to fire the general breast With keen vindictive rage, to add revenge To public spirit, to cement with blood Messenia's combination: Have I given A test of more than mortal reach? Phil. Thou hast! Mem. Then let the hopes of more than mortal aid Expell despondence from your sinking hearts! And, to assure you more, this instant hour Rites, to your climes unknown, shall ope the gates Of yon Empyrean, on this gloomy scene To let in more than day. Then shall ye know With due precision, what the gods require And what they promise. Haste ye slaves, erect [To some of his own slaves. The altar of the Magi. Light the flame And meet the coming dirge with holy songs!— —Break the deep gloom of yon funereal cloud With heavenly splendours, like created light With Hades old contending. [The slaves prepare the altar, the holy fire, &amp;c. the Helot chiefs with Aristodemus go to meet the funeral procession. MEMNON —ALONE. Thanks to the knowlege from my sire deriv'd Of old Messenia's story! To those swains I seem a delegate from heaven! They take My flowery fictions, my poetic tales For dictates of the gods, immortal themes! Yet of such prophecies I have been told Or true or false. If true, why should not I Avail me of that energy they breathe To second my own views? Alcander's life (Had he surviv'd,) had serv'd me as a base To build my claims; on one congenial stem Our titles might have grown to after times In everlasting bloom. But he is gone!— His sister still remains; her claims to mine Are hostile; tho' alike. I must contrive To break this bar, or move it from my way! I would not dip my hands in regal blood! It only then remains, by artifice To spirit her away, or fright her hence By fear of some impending ill,—they come! [The funeral procession approaches, attended by Aristodemus, Philemon, and the rest of the Helot chiefs. Phil. There fell Messenia's glories! Thou art fled Brave spirit! Who amidst the bellowing storm (When prying curiosity, appall'd, Dreaded to walk our vales, and murther slunk Into her wolvish den, with blood embath'd) Came like the spirit of the tempest forth When, riding on the clouds, he calls to arms His fiery factions in the angry air, Then, when the loud revolt of nature seem'd In Ithome's aspiring sons to rouse Each independent passion, dormant long. When to the waving woods and sobbing storm Eurotas, swoln to rage, by watry moons His solemn cadence join'd,—then—how he stood Like some sage master of a powerful spell Thro' the fermenting multitude around Erecting their fallen hopes, and teaching slaves To think and feel like men. But oh, ye shades Of old Amyclæ! you, ye conscious groves! The fatal secret was not kept! Ye storms! Ye winds proclaim'd it! Every partial god That favour'd Sparta, watch'd the gloomy hour Pale Hecat watch'd, and mixt her midnight bane To dash our sacred counsels—else, how dar'd Those wolves of Sparta, crouching to their dens Before the Attic hunter, they, who long Have seem'd afraid to stain our peaceful cots With moon-light massacre, or lust, again, Thus to insult a people? Thus to shed Our dearest blood? Amph. Alas! my friend, too sure The mystic secret of his birth, so long Our best palladium, and the charm, that kept Whate'er of ancient manhood yet remain'd Or loyalty alive, tho' known to few Was certainly divulged—else why on him (After a long deceitful pause) should Fate Fasten at once, and bear our hopes away? Phil. Behold the slaughter'd son, and mourning sire. [Enter Helots, bearing the body of Alcander, Aristodemus, &amp;c. Arist. Here rest the lov'd Alcander's last remains! That daring and intrepid soul, so late Who might have rais'd Alcides' falling race Now ranges in Elysian liberty, No longer manacled to earth, compell'd In painful post to combat with the tide Of this bad world!—Thy virtues—noble youth! Were splendid signs that led the venom'd shaft With surer level to its mortal mark!— Thy worth undid thee!—hadst thou been content To slumber out the live-long, thoughtless night Amongst thy fellow hinds without a dream Of what thy ancestors once were,—I now Like other sires had own'd a living son!— But, oft when others slept, thy soaring soul Took wing from this ignoble nook, and sped Her way to other worlds, congenial climes To hold high converse with thy mighty sires And breathe that pure Ethereal flame, that lifts The man to godhead! Why those splendid boons This prodigality of heaven, and waste Of worth, like some vile hind, to fall obscure By a Laconian ruffian's hand, unless To mock the hopes of Man? Mem. I thought, old sire. Those earthly vapours had no longer power To trouble thy clear intellect, so late Admitted to the counsel of the gods An earthly guest!—must I again repeat The need of some uncommon sacrifice Some deed of direst import, whose deep guilt Devotes the bloody city to the power Of him, who is the source of every ill?— —To those lethargic spirits, long disus'd To flame at common wrongs, some flagrant act Was requisite, to fire plebeian souls To thoughts of vengeance! Know, the heav'nly powers Work not by human means, else man might think All things the regular effect of Fate Or rul'd by yon revolving orbs above And quite forget their being! But full oft Dreadful and devious, as the comet's course By signal and astounding steps they move To call us back, when wand'ring. Know besides The two contending powers, who sway below Great Orosmades, and the dreaded name Of Arimanius, source of every ill (Your Jove, and Pluto) oft in council dread Meet on their frontiers, and with league unknown Dispense the fortunes of this nether world The scene of their alternate sway), like Sol And his fair nightly sister, silver-thron'd.— Oft, when the power beneficent is pleased To raise some state, or bid a people breathe Th'ambrosial air of dear bought liberty He gives his dark competitor the power To arm his red right hand with every plague That humbles mortals, famine, fire and sword, Inclement seasons, and the dreadful band Of pestilential armies in mid air Encamping on the settled gloom. By them He wreaks his horrible intent, and deems The subject world his own, but deems in vain The friendly power permits his fell carreer And over rules his rage. The dire extreme Sharpens the human intellect, and calls The manly virtues forth, calm Vigilance, Devotion, Fortitude, the social tyes That fasten man to man with links of love And lists a band of heroes, fit to brave The mortal menace of oppressive power. Phil. Interpreter of heaven! thou well hast prov'd Thy mighty Mission by no vulgar signs!— —Thy words might chear despondence, but, alas! Had Jove design'd our freedom, he had left The heir of Aristomenes to lead Her loyal armies!—I am chill'd with years! Without a son! Mem. But not without a child! Thou hast a daughter, lovely as the morn She has a lover, bold, aspiring, brave, And one who shares the honour of thy blood Adopt him to your line! Arist. His worth is witness'd By the attachment of his fellow slaves O be their love less perilous to him Than to Alcander! heaven benights our views! Mem. To clear your doubts, (if any doubts remain) An awful revelation, yet behind Ripe for disclosure, labours to a birth!— Amph. Where will this end? I feel a sacred awe As if some god in human shape, were near! Phil. A god or man he seems, the sent of heaven Attend! he opes her lips to speak again. Mem. Know then! desponding men! on Persia's bounds My youth, observant of the will of heaven Was fixt to watch the never dying flame To which th'imperial heirs of Cyrus bend. Thence, when reliev'd at last, at early day As, overwatch'd, I laid me down to rest Where thro' the purple gates of morn ascend Visions of true presage, methought I saw The blush of early day, ascending still— I seem'd to watch the mists that roll away From fair Gedrosia's western hills, before The coming god, to spy the first, faint beam That gilds their lofty brows, and hail the power With wonted hymns adoring:—Soon aslant The misty curtain mov'd away in folds Of gorgeous tissue, by the orient beam Enrich'd with all heaven's drapery, that seem'd To match the labour of cælestial looms— The piny mounts umbrageous sides appear'd In pomp of light and shade, disclosing full His giant lineaments, as the light clouds Mov'd over his majestic front, now hid Now manifest, in morns resplendent vest. Deep echo from the vales return'd the voice Of morning flocks and herds, the ruffling groves Swell'd with aerial minstrelsie and all Was vernal life and joy! but, westward far An hovering cloud, upon the mountain brow Seem'd settling long, and oft was seen to poise His grey extended wings to fleet away And often seem'd, with light, fantastic toe To spurn the heath-crown'd height, like the blue flame That hovers o'er the dying taper's point.— —At last, from every glade and thicket near Each gulphy stream, and sedgy glen, it seem'd Its kindred fogs to call—the kindred bands In dim detachments up the channel'd sides Of that steep wilderness ascend, and mount Blotting the pure æthereal bounds.—Anon The bands of ancient night, disperst so late Seem'd rallying fast from their Tartarean caves And wide encroaching on the golden edge Of day, which, circumscrib'd, but lovely still Skirted the rosy orient. Like the powers Of Ariman they seem'd, when his proud hand Unfurls the flag of darkness in the face Of Orosmades, lord of life and love.— But with the west wind soon the stormy south His potent breath combin'd, and swept along The rallying fogs, wide verging to the poles In broad circumference around. The day Seem'd to retire, and call its orient beams Back to the fount of light. The fount of light Was seen no more. But in its stead, forth lanc'd The lurid lightning; in those peaceful bounds Where fair tranquillity for ever smiles The delegate of darkness seem'd to take His gloomy post and sadden all the sky: Then hurl'd his spells around; the last faint beam Soon sicken'd into night. I saw with dread The fearful portent, nor the portent long Was unexplain'd, for soon a faded form Desponding stood before my mental eye— It bore th'undoubted ensigns of the god Whose presence gilds our temples. Milteras, or the Sun, the tutelary Deity of the Persians. But his looks Were all eclips'd, his dazzling crown was lost Shorn of his beams he stood, like one depos'd From his celestial honours, and at length In sighs began. “Those signs which late you saw “Are ominous to Persia. From the west “The hand of Ariman conducts a foe “Portentous to her glory, as yon clouds “That blot my beams—from fair Ionias isles “The Doric bounds and Macedon they came “Like night and darken all Choaspes shore! “The heir of Cyrus from his noontide height “Falls like proud Clymene's presumptuous son “His safety is the discord of the foe “His hope is Sparta's fall.” Arist. Mysterious heaven! Her hope is Sparta's fall, and what is ours? Mem. After a solemn pause, he thus proceeds “Even now great Orosmades lends the means. “The Athenian squadrons, like the raging north “Lay the proud honours of her forests low “And in Amyclæ's groves a secret fire “Kindles amain, and soon will lift its head “O'er their devoted shades—the guardian god “Of Thebes Bacchus, supposed to have conquered India., who led his conquering squadrons on “To Ganges from Ismenos; will not scorn “To aid me, for of old my potent help “Confirm'd his victories, my temper'd beam “Foster'd his vines on India's palmy shore; “Held in suspense the periodic rains “Or gave the timely shower, with milky flow “To call the power of vegetation forth. “And, when the Naiad train, whose viewless bands “Supply the springs of Ganges, and dispense “To their calm votaries the limpid bowl “(Deem'd sacred as the noctar of the Gods) “To all the tribes of that religious land) “Dreading the vines inspiring juice, of power “To spread revolt among the sober swains “With deep nocturnal orisons implor'd “My sister goddess of the watry star “With her cold influence, and malignant power “To chill th'inverted year; to brew the rains “With deep'ning inundations from the hills “To sweep their summer glories all away “To Ethiopia's main.—I soon perceiv'd “The close confederacy, tho' wrapt in night— “Then when the congregated vapours spread “Dispensing wide their chill Tartarean steam “To the deep cavern, where the sisters sate “Prisoning the infant moons, I pointed full “My burning beam—the scatter'd vapours fled “And left the mountain's brow, the Naiad's band “Felt my full glories scorch their sea-green hair “And drop'd their tinkling urns, and fled away “To hide them in the mines, among the stores “Of unsunn'd silver, and forbid the fount “Above the flowery bank to swell the stream “Or drench, with ceaseless rain, the viny plant, “In favour to the god who gave the boon— “Go thou! I here divest thee of thy robes “As priest of Mithras! Go! and seek the shore “Where first Thebes, where Bacchus was born. he saw the light, approach the fane “On Daulias lofty summit, and declare “(After due Orisons) my urgent claims “For his alliance, bought with friendship old. “Bid him inspire his Thebans to the field “Against the Spartans haughty race, who threat “Even now, the throne of Cyrus! thence depart “And seek in fair Amyclæs groves, the tribes “Who boast the blood of old Messenia's line “(Tho' now the name be gone, disgrac'd and sunk “In that of Helot). If the swains receive “Thy mission gladly, rouse the bolder youths “To turn upon their lords, and nobly wrench “From their slack hands, the old, paternal spear “And face their cruel hunters.” Here he soar'd Amid the gathering gloom. Suspense I stood, Now wrapt in wonder, now in doubt involv'd How best to win my way to Daulias bounds Thro' warring nations. To Miletus thence Many a long league, in many a quaint disguise I shap'd my course at last, and thence embark'd Aboard a ship of Samos for the strand Of old Cithæron. Soon the black north west Arose, and drove our fated barque along To Malea's hostile bay, when soon we met Lysander's martial brigandine, and struck To his superior flag—the crew in chains Were doom'd to various toils, but I was sent (Thanks to the gods, who led my fated steps) To join my lot with you. Arist. Propitious gods! Could he, who sills his clay-cold bed, again Arise, how would he soar above all dread And coward doubt! How would he grasp the bolt Of thund'ring Jove, in fancy, and disperse His foes, with heaven's own lightning? Mem. Better thus!— Perhaps, were he alive, his eager spirit Burning for premature exploits, would lead His Helots on to ruin, where the way Seem'd to conduct to glory.—Let that thought Be now thy solace! our revenge, tho' slow. Is certain. Arist. Then! Laconian tygers! then! I yet may live to thank you! not content With simple murther, on his godlike form Of matchless mold your savage malice stamp'd A thousand wounds—ye meant it his disgrace. It is his glory, that his worth provok'd Such wolves as you, that bay the radiant moon For shining on your fell misdeeds—ye marr'd That beauteous face with wounds—the sovereign feat Of manly beauty, where revenge and malice Might look their rage away!— Mem. Old man! no more! The time prohibits weak complaint—let all Loud passions cease! and in this quiet grove No accent of impatience taint the time Due to religion.—You, the ministers (Selected for the purpose,) light the lamp The symbol of that radiant power, who leads The golden day, whom Persia's tribes adore At dead of night, and at the blushing dawn, He led them on to glory—from the east Inspiring godlike Cyrus to pursue The flaming track of his diurnal car Till Asia's western climes confest their lord And Egypt sunk before him!—Call around Your Helots to partake the solemn rite And from the splendid shrine, with beating heart Inhale the present god, while breathing high Poetic rapture swells the solemn strain Such as from Sparta's flute yet never flow'd: Devoting Lacedæmon to the powers Of Ariman and everlasting night Others prepare Alcander's funeral pile. [The sacred lamp is lighted and set on the urn over the tomb of Aristomenes. Mem. Chaos, and ancient night! Ye nameless powers Who share the throne of darkness, and preside Over the moonless realms, forgive the strain That hails your luminous rivals, far remote! Nor deem us rebels to your ancient sway That thus we sing the god, whose orient beam Pierc'd your primæval shadows, and expell'd From half your bounds Oblivion's torpid reign. Ye swarthy Satraps! from your ancient claims We mean not to detract! But (if our vows Merit acceptance in your gloomy realms, Dishonour'd by creation) to send down New colonies from these devoted plains, Whose deeds of genuine darkness well have earn'd The dire distinction. Now begin the hymn. HYMN TO THE SUN. Hail! resplendent orb of day, Where'er thou point'st thy circling ray, Now, perhaps, with downward rein, Coursing o'er the Indian main, Or led thro' unknown tracts of æther blue, Giving the nether world thy beams to view. At thy flaming steeds returning, Nature lays aside her mourning, Nature wakes the choral throng, While thou inspir'st the general song. The morning gales that rising sweep Old Sericana's purple wave, Bear the fogs in phalanx deep, Back to Demogorgon's cave! The verdant tribes of summer, which ascend, Deep clust'ring from the genial soil below, With silent transport feel your influence blend, The spring of life, and love's transporting glow. Thus thy burning shaft employ, 'Gainst Laconia's tyrant sway, Till thou seest their squadrons fly Like the fogs at early day, Thus along the smooth Eurutas, (Soil unknown to every worth) Rising thick as flowery Lotes; Give the manly virtues birth!— Mem. Break off—break off—the bright symbolic sign Burns ominous and dim, like Persia's god, When Night's fair empress comes, with envy pale, To intercept his glory. We must try Some other charms. I shudder but to think On those that still remain! For, what remains But that, which cleaves the mundane shell, and calls The weary ghost (new reconcil'd to night, And all her solemn charms) to hated day Again?—And one portentous bribe alone Has weight to gain the gloomy Ariman, To render back his purchase! Arist. What is that? Say, Persian! thou, that hold'st with either world, Thy dread communication, is it needful That more of old Messenia's royal race Should bleed? My gallant ancestor (whose name Is now, alas! my only boast) when Sparta, (Detested Sparta!) girt with direful siege His capital; when thy resplendent god (Our Delphian oracle) with sad response, Demanded from the Herculean line A spotless maid (to please the powers below, And with her immolated blood atone For thousands) soon o'ercame paternal fear.— I have a daughter. Does that stern regard, Say, I must also quell paternal fear? Mem. Aside. Such is my aim, old man!—You guess aright, But know not yet my motive nor my claim To old Messenia's throne, were she remov'd, Her fears, if nothing else, shall chace her hence. Arist. My child is dear as life—nay, dearer far. Slavery had long ere now sunk this grey head To seek a welcome grave. But love prolong'd My days, in thraldom, and in shame. Yet say not That she shall bleed! I have no hopes but her, Nor other hope does now Messenia boast.— —Some, it is true, of great Alcides line, In bondage, or in exile, may survive, But she alone is known the lineal heir Of our Messenian stem! And, should she fall, The bond, that holds our wretched tribes together, Sinks with her to the ground, and what am I To fill a nation's trust? Mem. Aside. Or she, or I Must quit the claim! [To Aristodemus. I take it not upon me To tell the gods' intent at large;—but soon, Perhaps, your messenger from Delphis' fane Will clear your doubts. The virgin's sacrifice At Ithome, by her stern sire's command, Was not accepted. For Messenia's hands Were foul with long-contracted guilt, the same Which now brings down the wrath of all the gods On Sparta. Your stern sires, without regard To age or station, with repeated stripes Compell'd their Pylian slaves to labour on Beyond the strength of man. Such was the guilt That sunk your nation to the ground. But now, After long ages of atoning shame, Your toil-worn tedious summers in the eye Of righteous Nemesis, perhaps, will meet A due regard, and blessing on the rite, Whoe'er may be the victim. And behold! Your messenger returns. Aside. My fate and her's Are now in even scale! Enter PHORBAS. Arist. Come, without preface, Deliver what you bring! The time precludes All ceremonious prelude!— Phor. Then I fear We are betray'd. At least, that our proud lords Suspect our purpose! Mem. On what grounds dost thou Imagine this? Phor. When first I reach'd the fane, At morn, I met Pausanias in the porch, He spoke not; but with dark suspicious look Survey'd me round, as if to read my soul, And strait departed. Arist. We, alas! have felt His fear, by marks more deadly. Oh! my son! Thy fall too plainly spoke the Spartan dread! Phor. seeing the body. Ha!—is Alcander fallen—Oh! mortal wound To all our hopes!—Ye Helicean bands, Ye now may stray, like flocks without a guide! That youthful leader, whom your hopes pourtray'd, Your dearest hopes beguiles! Arist. Enough of him.— But say!—You nam'd the Helicean bands. What bands of Helice? Phor. That unseen power, Which bids alternate waves of night and day Roll o'er this nether globe (while here ye mourn In double depth of woe and midnight gloom) Leads on the day-spring from Naupactus height, In bright procession! Arist. From Naupactus coast? Has Athens seiz'd the strait; and, from the shore Of Pisa, pour'd her legions? Then her sword, From either quarter lops the giant limbs Of this new Typhon! Pylos, Pisa now Confess th'Athenian sway! Phor. From Athens nought I learn'd, but from the Delphian porch I saw A noble youth, with looks of chearful haste Returning. Mem. But those Helicean bands, What are they, and from whence? Phor. Lament no more. Forget your bonds! For oh! thou happy sire! Thou yet mayst see Messenia lift her head, Her crested head, proud as yon waving pines, Proud as the sons of old Ithome, led By godlike Aristomenes, to sweep The haughty files of Sparta from the field, Or send them trembling to their wolfish dens! For know, my friends, on the Crissean shores, Your nation still survives, that seem'd extinct, For ever sunk on sandy Pylos coast. It lives again, like that sulphureous mine, That sinks, they say, in Etna's flaming gorge, Then from Vesuvius, lances to the stars, And frights fair Italy. These poor remains Of Ithome, long hid, and foster'd long Obscurely in Ætolia; have burst forth Like yonder Pleiads from the wintry storm, That takes a surly leave! But late they crost In many a proud bark o'er the wond'ring wave Of Crissa, clad in arms, and settle now Round Helice and Bura, to the strand Of western Elis. Like a band they come, Of hornets, from our fields to drive away Those monsters fed with gore! Their pæans loud Peal to the sounding main. The sounding main Sends them provisions, arms, and warlike stores From rich Naupactus, and the ports around, That skirt the long Crissean, and obey Athenian influence, or Athenian power. Arist. This from report we learn'd before, but fear'd It was some hostile stratagem, to lure Our hopes to blossom, like untimely spring, Check'd by the nipping North's invidious breath. Phor. Those eyes beheld them. Mem. Where? Phor. Even now—But now That sun, whose steeds a few short hours ago Plung'd in the broad Ionian, saw the scene, Saw his red splendours as they rose, return'd By old Messenia's far reflecting files Doubling the day;—the purple main afar, In hoarse applause, remurmur'd to the voice Of early vows to the associate gods, Latona's Apollo, the Sun. son, and Neptune. Either god, From the blue empire and the burning throne, Each other seem'd with mutual smiles to hail, Mingling their glories! Mem. Viz. The Sun, Mithras, the Persian Deity.He that rules the day From his bright station deals impartial light, Both to the proud oppressor and the slave Who drags the clanking chain. The tyrant scorns Th'ætherial blessing, and the weary wretch But wakes to curse his rising beam, that shows A long variety of woe and pain. But in the nightly visions of the just, (After his radiant eyes have view'd the world, Its miseries and wrongs) he deals around That awful verdict oft, that seals the doom Of thoughtless tyrants, tho' they bask secure Beneath his blessed beam. Phor. Thou well recall'st My stray'd remembrance to its holier task The message of the oracle. The rite Of sacrifice was past—the Pythian maid Ascends the tripod, and in pale suspense Attends the coming god—The coming god Known, by the sparkling eye, the horrent hair And heaving breast, at length, descending full His wonted seat possest, and, after pause Her lab'ring words found way “Messenian race “Alcmena's son Hercules, the patron of Messenia. before the parent god “Presents your prayers, and joins his suppliant voice “To learn, if yet the period is arriv'd “To lift you from the dust—and break your bonds “The period long is past (returns the god “Who wields the thunder)yet it still returns” Each morning, golden opportunity Daughter of time, revisits yonder plains And every night returns, with new complaint Of fair occasions, lost by negligence Or coward fear. The only means to learn What moment favours freedom is to know The time, when mortals dare to act or die When the existence of a slave is scorn'd Compar'd with independence. Let them learn (If not from men) from those proud savages That roam the midnight groves, and thin the fold With dark invasion—did they ever know The tramels of a slave? or meanly fawn For a poor pittance at a master's foot Or draw the pond'rous plow? My instinct lives In them. That Eleuthorian flame, that warm'd The sons of Athens, when the Persian fled Before his lifted spear! My instinct lives In every sinewy arm that wields the spade Or goads the steer on yon Laconian plain And would they learn my will, let them consult The oracle It is well known that the responses of the oracle, were often the result of political influence. within! Arist. By all our wrongs Thou bring'st an answer, worthy of a god! And may the tide of time for ever bear Our generations to oblivion's deep If now we miss the fair occasion given At once to seize, that lifts us to the view On this wide theatre of gods and men Applauding! Phorb. Hear the sequel, for the maid Forsook not yet the tripod “Sons of Ithome” In calmest mood she thus began “The means “How to commence the dread carreer of fame “Are yet to learn: the goal is in your view “The first step gains the race, the conscious moon “Must see you turn against the savage foe “Who marks your tracks with blood! the coming night “Soon in her shadowy retinue shall bring “The wonted ruffian to your peaceful plains “With wolvish spirit, prowling for his prey “Him seize, and to the subterranean gods “Pour his devoted blood! The manly deed “By all partaken, will to all dispense “Unshaken fortitude and firm resolve. “Kindled by taste of hostile blood, despair “Of pardon from their dire vindictive lords “And settled purpose to succeed, or dye.” Mem. Aside. Then I must haste to wake my rival's fears And from th'imagin'd danger speed her flight. [Exit privately. Phil. 'Twas then that ruffian's shadow which obscur'd The lamp of Mithras, when it burn'd so dim! The prescient gods have sent the dark eclipse To warn us of the prey, which now, perhaps On this dread verge with blind unconscious tread Is entring on our snares.—Begin the search. Arist. Then this alone remains.—Oh! had I learn'd The secret sooner! had Apollo deign'd To wake our fears before Alcander fell And mark'd the ruffian as he walk'd our woods Alcander yet had liv'd, or we, at worst, Had seen the murth'rer pour his hated blood To the dread queen of Vengeance! Phorb. Yet, perhaps Flush'd with success, the ruffian of the night Again may visit these sad groves; the blame If then he scapes, will light on us. The gods Have free'd themselves. Arist. Go Mardon! Cephatus! Terpander! Pheron! Pyramus! and Dymas! Each in your several districts, wake your friends And bid their busy footsteps trace the dews Till dawn—no common prey shall crown their toil.— —Fair daughter of Latona, whose bright lamp So oft has led the robber to his prey— O thou, whose virgin ear was oft profan'd With cries of violation. Thou whose shafts On Tityus and Orion, veng'd of old Their brutal purpose—pierce those envious clouds Remove the veil of night, and give to view The secret foe, that comes, with fell intent To stain thy virgin walks with recent blood! End of the First Act. ACT II. Scene—The Same. MEMNON —SOLUS. The billet did its business well—it woke Her fears, and chac'd her from her father's house.— But why return'd, and whence this wond'rous tale Of violence and rescue? Is it feign'd Or true?—It is no time to question now! I still am unsuspected, and some means Of more effect this working brain must find To spirit her away, and leave no space To lay the basis of my fortunes deep But here the rangers, and their captive come, I hasten to resume my priestly garb! [Exit. [Aristodemus, and Helots, bring in a captive. Arist. Haste—bring him hither—We adore yon gods! You have not bade us linger in suspence Upon a nation's doom! Produce your captive! Oh! should it be the ruffian, whose fell hand; Laid my young hero low—how would I thank you? Tho' poor even that atonement, for such blood, To take a single life! [The captive is led forward. His presence shows A manly beauty, and a port beyond The vulgar file! The gods have chosen a victim Not quite unworthy of the great occasion! Say where you found him, how employ'd, how arm'd, On what design? 1st Hel. No sign of guilt he show'd, No mark of terror his demeanor wore, More than you see at present; nay, he ask'd To be conducted hither. Arist. to the Cap. Tell me—say Why that impassion'd gate? that scornful smile! Cap. From no contempt. I smile at your mistake. Yourselves will smile, when you forget your rage Against your firmest friends! Arist. What! art thou not A Spartan, and a ruffian, sent to spy, And single from our tribes the choicest prey To dye your maiden sword in Helot's gore? Cap. From no Laconian veins my birth I draw, As well my dialect may show. My country Is that distinguish'd Athens. land, where Theseus rul'd, Now the proud arbitress of Greece. To you, (If you command those Helot tribes) I bear My orders. Arist. Tell thy business! Falter not! It must be bloody, deep, important, secret, Well suited to the past; but no disguise Will here avail. Messenia's tottering state (To be cemented by thy Spartan blood) Must not be baffled by a soothing tale! Cap. Mistaken men! Would Heaven the time allow'd To send to Athens, (if you doubt my faith) Your fears would soon disperse! Arist. An artful scheme! But futile as the former! You would gain Time to elude our vengeance, and to leave us To wonder at our folly! Cap. Send this instant.— Be I your hostage till your messenger Returns. Then will you find me not a spy, But delegated from th'Athenian state, To proffer aid; nay more, to raise you high From this inglorious state, akin to beasts, To cope with men. Arist. You think us beasts, indeed, Devoid of all sagacity!—Whate'er Thy purpose, thou and thy confederate friends Can best disclose. But now thy thin pretext Is all transparent as the air. Thy words— Yes—thine own words condemn thee! We ourselves A messenger already have dismiss'd To Athens and to Delphi, both at once, And were there aught of moment, not by thee, But them, the answer had been sent. But thou Prepare to meet thy doom! [As they are going to seize him. Cop. Hold! On your lives Presume not thou to touch me, or thy slaves! Approach not, or by all th'Athenian gods, An horrible revenge awaits the deed. Let me but send to Athens! Let me wait In bonds, till my credentials may arrive! Amph. Could it be done!—But think, Aristodemus, How often wild temerity has rued The violence of direful deeds too late. Arist. He only wants to profit by delay, And what from thence might grow. He bears no stamp Of Athens in his dialect, or garb!— Have we not seen Athenians? And from whence Can he then be, but from our deadliest foes, Our masters of Laconia! Call the priest, [Exit Helot. And bid the altars fume. Propitious gods Accept our offering! Cap. Am I then to fall Obscure, inglorious, by a curst mistake? Nay, then, whatever hostile power, whose hate Has lur'd me to the snare, shall never see me Thus tamely, like a steer, to slaughter led! [Struggles and overthrows several of the Helots, but is at last overpowered and muffled for sacrifice. Enter MEMNON, as Priest.—The Altar lighted and surrounded with preparations for Necromancy. Mem. Ye nameless powers! who in the dark profound, Despise the common sacrifice, and joy To see the voluntary victim throw The load of life aside! Ye who inspire The Gentian widow with the dire resolve To plunge amid the slaming bounds, that part Both worlds, and seek the partner of her soul In other elements than ours—command The dull, reluctant, lingering wish away. That ties the sullen captive to the world! Give him to taste of immortality. That his exalted sentiment may scorn The vapid pleasures of this nether clime, That sicken in enjoyment! Imp his wings, That droop like some young eaglet's, on the verge Of dread vacuity, yet unexplored, Till his undaunted parent heaves him off, To poise his pinions in the wide expanse Of the sustaining air. If ye accept The offering, by thy dread response, we soon Shall learn! The gods, who rule our changing spheres Remand us back to you, who know no change In purpose or in fortune. They will melt At human woe, and turn at human prayer, Like their own clouds and sunshine. Ye are stern, Immoveable, and scorn the wav'ring breeze That causes chance and change below! Prepare The rites! And now produce the captive youth, Unmask him—let him look upon his fate. [The mask is taken off and discovers Alcibiades. Mem. Aside. Ha!—Who is here! Oh Nemesis and Jove! What dreadful vision bursts upon my sight! My deadliest foe within my power! The man That caus'd my exile, forc'd me to renounce My native clime—and oh—but I must save him, Else my revenge were short of half its ends.— It must be full, complete! Arist. What new delay? Some sudden ecstasy has seiz'd our priest, Mark his disorder'd mein, his kindling eyes Like glaring orbs, that threat revenge and war!— And now they melt to pity—say what means This strange convulsion?— Mem. Aside. This may yet be manag'd To save him, all unworthy as he is I yet may gain him!— To Arist. Pardon, reverend sire The gods in mystic warning yet suspend The prisoner's fate! His birth is wrapt in clouds Athenian, or Laconian, none can tell— Forbid it, Heaven! the altar should be stain'd With aught but hostile gore! Messenia paid Too dear already for a sad mistake! Arist. We will not be deluded!—say, what means Your mystic rapture?—Name the wondrous man So late our captive for intended crimes On bloody purpose bent, and seiz'd within Our groves; now suddenly transform'd and claim'd The favourite of the gods!— Mem. The gods demand A Spartan life, but should your hasty hand Shed this youth's blood (no Spartan blood perhaps) Messenia still might mourn. [To them, enter Semanthe in haste. Sem. Immortal gods! I am not yet, I hope, too late to save My saviour—to return him life for life! Arist. What profanation's this!—Semanthe! Why Forgetful of your sex, will you intrude Where yet no female is allowed to spy Our interdicted rites? Sem. Forgive me, father! Forgive the transports of a grateful mind I heard the rumour of a captive's fate— My heart presag'd it might be he, whose arm Guarded my life—I ran, I flew to save him Oh my prophetic heart! this! this is he Who snatch'd me from the ruffians! Arist. Gracious heaven! From what a dreadful plunge of fate I rise How every hour with strange discoveries teems Forgive, whoe'er thou art, the dark intent.— What horrour had surrounded me! What guilt Of black ingratitude, tho' undesign'd Tho' sanction'd by religion! Yet disclose Why thus involv'd in night, and dark disguise You chose to hide your worth! Alcib. Thy son could tell Whom oft I met in secret—but I spare Your heart the keen remembrance of your loss.— I did not wish that more than one (and he Of highest trust) should know the deep intent That led me hither—tho' my lucky hand Rescu'd the fair Semanthe, when I learn'd Alcander's fate, I deem'd Messenia's hope For ever sunk, and deep desponding trac'd My backward steps, irresolute to go Or stay. To warm your Helots to revenge Or leave them tamely in their turns to fall Deliberating long I stood—Till fate Drew these night rangers on my lonely track.— But those strange rites, this midnight sacrifice, Those awful preparations shew, that still The spirit of my slaughter'd friend survives. Even from below, the powers that love revenge Seem to call on us. Even the fates proclaim Some mighty birth at hand! Arist. Twas then to thee We owe my son's too sanguine hopes. Alas! Too long it seem'd the birth of youthful fancy And generous ardour! Too intense it flam'd, Too, too conspicuous! Like the lambent blaze That hovers o'er Eurotas' banks by night, It led the midnight murtherer to his mark, Whose fatal dagger struck my noblest hopes To earth! Alcib. If consolation yet can touch Thy heart, be it thy comfort, reverend sire, That now, with better caution we pursue Our plan, which else the ardour of thy son, (Generous and bold, but to the perilous times Ill suited) had undone. He, by his birth And merit, mark'd our pilot, in a sea, Full of quick sands, and shoals, and sudden flaws, And dangerous currents, had o'erset our bark, Which needs more steady hands (like yours) to steer. Arist. Alas, I am too old! My nerves are slack With grief and age! Tho' vengeance well might brace Limbs more decrepid and relax'd than mine. Alcib. Your son is fallen, but still the line survives In your fair daughter. On her choice, by you Confirm'd, the fortunes of your line depend. A race, that underneath the patron power Of Athens, yet may climb its antient throne. —But let us leave this dark, ill-omen'd spot, This scene, design'd for massacre and blood; Its omen suits not with our better hopes. Come—I have something further to propose, Beyond your boldest aims. [Exit Alcib. Arist. Seman. and Helots. Mem. Alone. But now he was within my grasp—and now He breaks the snare. Oh foolish pity! Vain Remorse! I thought him bold! I deem'd him brave! His blooming beauty, his aspiring hopes, His generous scorn of every danger, won My heart to let her just revenge exhale And speak the word that sav'd him! But even now His fate or mine, has led him to pronounce The word that seals his doom, unless his heart Recall it! If I took his aim aright, His last proposal show'd a close intent To share Messenia's claims, Messenia's rise, To gain that lovely maid in whose blue veins The hopes unite of that old regal line.— —I cross him there, or perish in the attempt.— I with Semanthe share the royal blood. And he is mine—mine—by an elder claim! I thought my bosom arm'd with triple steel. I, who, for years had roam'd barbarian climes, Had seen and felt the horrors and the toils Of servitude. But servitude to this Is freedom, ease, and transport! Heaven and earth! Were all my toils for this disastrous end, To see another gain the glorious prize, The price of all my tears, my wand'rings all! —He seem'd within my reach. I well could bear, Like Tantalus, to lose the golden fruit Of all my care! But to behold the spoil Another's! There distraction lurks, and death Suspicion, rage, and all the jealous fiends. —But let me not betray my sex too soon. Let me not blast Messenia's fairest hopes! Oh! mockery of reason! Vain result Of thirty tedious moons in patience spent In bondage and in sorrow! Holy source Of constancy and inward light, that spreadst Over the swelling tempest of the mind Thy halcyon calm, whatever be thy name That rul'st the mental tumult! Oh! dispense One ray to me! nor suffer me to mar With selfish passions thus the glorious birth Commencing! Yet I may at least, explore His spirit! The foul taint of jealousy Perhaps has warp'd my reason! Or, perhaps, Semanthe may be found alone! If not, She has a lover! Be it mine to fire His mind with jealousy against this guest, This new defender of Messenia's maids From midnight ruffians. May kind Heaven avert The dire necessity! I would not mar That harmony, which chears the rising state With ill-tim'd discord 'mongst her chiefs—if Heaven Forbid not other methods. Fate and love Reign paramount. But see, beyond my hopes, See where she steals to pour the secret prayer Before the hallow'd urn! I must retire. [Walks apart. Enter SEMANTHE. [SEMANTHE] Shall I that secret to the gods disclose I scarce can tell myself? O thought profane, Will they, too partial, aid my fond pursuits, And with the mist of passion blind, release From right's eternal bonds, the heedless wretch, A willing captive of the wand'ring heart? I dare not think it. Syren! cease your strain, For from that urn there comes a solemn voice That checks the passions in their wild career, And pales the rosy hue of Hope. It says, “Oh think, Semanthe! on my fate!—no more, “Thy brother's hand the helm of Reason sways, “Or aids thee with his counsels! Thou, perhaps, “Sole heiress of Messenia's line, canst boast “That awful verdict lodged within thy lips, “On which thy country's weal depends! thy choice “Sows discord thro' our plains, or gently sooths “Our patriotic bands to peace! Thy choice, “Or Hymen, with the Graces shall attend, “Or the pale Furies light the nuptial flame.” And how shall I resolve, when either choice Frowns with alternate danger! On each hand I see the deep fermenting storm, that wrecks My peace—but with mute eloquence, my heart Presses decision. Friendly monitor! Dumb guide to wisdom! Thy successful vote At last I find will turn the fatal scale! Mem. Aside. Then it is time, misguided maid, to foil The Stygian charm that brews eternal feuds Against the coming peace! The public cause And mine are now combin'd: with confidence I go to thwart her hopes. [Comes forward. Sem. Kneels Immortal gods! Who art thou? Of this earth, or from above? It was not fancy then! The voice was thine Which even but now I heard, or seem'd to hear! Whence and what art thou? Let not feeble mortals Dissolve with terror at this awful hour, When the dread barriers of the meeting worlds Are broke!—When heaven converses oft with earth, And to the charm'd soul, of her kindred skies, The rapturous hint conveys! Mem. That humble posture Befits not fellow mortals. Know'st thou not My voice, my garb? Sem. Ha! Memnon! Why this time, This place? I sink with terror! Why delay Behind! Doth it become a man, like thee, To listen to my orisons? But here It suits me ill to be observ'd with thee, If any eye beheld us! Mem. From thy slave, Dread not a deed or word, but such as Virtue Might hear and see! Thou shalt not need thy friend, Thy hardy champion in those awful shades, To virtue sacred, and to public love, To vengeance, and to fame! Sem. My champion! mean'st thou An insult by this word? Mem. Thy pardon, fair one! I did not mean to call the burning blush Over thy cheek! He, whom thy father's voice, Destin'd to that blest union, were he nam'd, Had scarcely wak'd a warmer tinge. Sem. Thy words, And sly, officious observation, veil'd Beneath the covert of the night, to spy, (Like some dark fiend, who waits the witching hour To shed infection) the disclosing soul; But ill becomes my father's seeming friend, A person delegated by the gods To offices more dignified! Mem. I pardon This error—'tis the time's mistake—nor thine. So far your first conjecture was well founded. —I am not what I seem.— Sem. Aside. Would I could know If he o'erheard my orisons, or not; For, if my father knows, I'm lost. To Mem. What mystery Wouldst thou unfold, that, at this awful hour Thou meet'st me here? I did not come to hold Converse with aught beneath yon radiant sky.— Heavens! are we not allow'd to shed a tear Upon a brother's tomb, but midnight eyes, Thro' idle curiosity, or worse, Infest our lonely walks? Mem. Your indignation Becomes you well. But it is needless now. Our meeting was to me the work of chance. But what I heard, nor time, nor chance, nor change Shall from this bosom wring. Tho' much, perhaps, (More than you yet surmise) your secret words, (When none, you thought, was near) alarm'd my soul, And wak'd a grief which years had lull'd to rest. —Wonder not that it flows—and for a time Denies you the discovery. Sem. Tears! Amazement! How could the casual breathing of a prayer In calm deliberation, heard or not Concern your peace.—A sojourner, an Asian A few short moons with us! A foreigner Born in a climate half the world from us Remote? Mem. Fair maid! No drop of Persian blood Flows in those veins! Full sixteen summers past O'er this devoted head before I crost The swelling main, and lost the Grecian name, (My birthright,) by the doom of cruel Fate And yet more cruel man, torn from me!— Sem. Still Your words bewilder,—but excuse me, stranger, If other proofs, besides your bare assertion Are needed!—were it my concern.— Mem. Full proof I could disclose, and will.—The fraud itself Bears witness to my truth.— Sem. You speak in riddles Yourself, your dress, your words, are mystic all. Mem. A single word dispells the mournful cloud That hangs upon my fate! This Persian garb (A dress, to either sex adapted well) Conceals—a woman. Sem. Gracious Heaven! A woman! From whence thy origin. What country claims Thy birth! Asph. In far-fam'd Athens once, like you, I was accounted fair, till wasting grief, (For yet few years are past) like winter's rage, Laid desolate those charms, so boasted once And 'mongst the lovely daughters of our clime Not least renown'd. You seem to doubt me still. Convince your eyes. [Opening her bosom. I sought this blest occasion To trust th'important secret to your faith. Sem. Aside. Oh Heavens! I see it plain! She is a rival, And she or I, am lost.— To her. I'm all amazement! End my perplexity at once, and tell What fortune sent you hence to Asia's shore, From Asia to Eurotas! Asp. To that city Whose fleets now ride triumphant round your coasts, The seat of arts, of eloquence, and arms I owe my birth. Yet not of Attic stem. —My parents were by race Athenian exiles. Oft have I heard, and wept the mournful tale Of Ithomes sad fate. Sem. More wonders still! Where will this end? Thou of Messenian race! Asp. And of no vulgar one. To Euphaes Nearly allied. Oh! had my lofty birth Inspir'd me with the spirit which belong'd To that high rank, I ne'er had worn disguise, Nor past for a plebeian slave, the spy Of sunburnt swains! Sem. Say, what disastrous chance Sent you to Athens? Asp. Ask the young Athenian, Your captive, and your champion, on whose word Perhaps your country's weal depends, and guess The rest! Sem. It is then as I fear'd. [Aside. Asp. His vows Upon my fond belief impos'd, the sooner, As all our meetings were by night conceal'd, My hapless father had a tincture still Of regal pride, and would have scorn'd the son Of Clinias The father of Alcibiades. for his heir! Sem. Aside. And so, perhaps, Would mine! But my poor father's royal blood Is tainted with vile slavery; and the son Of Clinias, in his turn, might scorn me too! Asp. His vows impos'd upon my virgin heart— My shame was known— The laws of the Athens assign'd to fathers the power of inflicting capital punishments on their children. my father doom'd me dead.— —A faithful slave, partaker of my guilt, Attended my escape. In man's disguise We stole by moonlight thro' the neighbouring port, Where stood a brigantine for Samos bound.— Our gold obtain'd our passage, and the bark, With easy sail, divided the blue wave, That sparkled to the moon beam, as she plow'd Her foamy course. But, oh! thou conscious moon! Pale witness of my guilt, and of my flight, Thy radiant light serene, the cloudless sky Caus'd our unhappy doom! Oh had the clouds From either end of Heaven roll'd o'er our heads, And hid our shining sails! Our shining sails By a Milesian corsair was descry'd, The splendid bucklers, rang'd along her side, By fits, thick flashing to the lunar beam Glar'd fate upon us, like the comet's blaze, As he advanc'd amain;—we yielded soon, For his force trebled ours—in Persia's pay. To Pharnabazus he his captive sold, The noblest far of our barbarian foes. A languishing disease had long confin'd This Persian lord. Some little skill I learn'd In herbs and simples from an hoary sire Who dwelt on fair Hymettus, (oft at morn My charming walk) was now of sovereign use, To the great satrap. I found out the means That rais'd him. With his health, his gratitude, To me, commenc'd: he gave me to the king. There Æsculapius still (to whom my pray'rs With unabating fervour flow'd) return'd My vows with every wish'd success; full thrice The circling sun had cloth'd Gedrosia's hills In summer pride, since next to regal state Was mine in Sufa's haughty court: I scorn'd These honours, when I felt each languid hour, (Tho' rich with many a gift,) the galling chain Of slavery, to the warm, ingenuous mind, More galling for its splendour. Some dark scheme, Some secret preparation 'gainst the weal Of my lov'd Athens urg'd me on to speed My wish'd return. I found—wouldst thou believe it?—In the hills Of Margiana The civil wars of Greece, promoted by the bribery of Persia., the detested source Of all the civil feuds that waste our states There, from the mines, near to the Stygian realm The pale fiend rises on the day, whose hand Sows discord thro' our nations, and dissolves That harmony of Greece, which Asia dreads Worse than the red-wing'd pestilence which rides The burning sky.—With steel and banded fleets Bold Xerxes sought our shores. His subtler heir— Directs his engines not against our walls Our forts, or navies—but against our minds And bears down all before him!— Sem. Why then here Delays thy mighty Mission? Why to Athens Returnst thou not, to Thebes, to Argos, Corinth, And show, what fatal spell, unknown to them Brews the dark storm that wrecks them? Asp. No design, No wish of mine to the Laconian shore Led my devoted steps, but wayward fate Or some kind god that wept Messenia's doom. I burn'd for liberty; and long'd, once more To see my native country, and expose The fatal arts of Persia.—From the court Veil'd in the humble habit of a slave Feigning a message to the Sardian court Where Tissaphernes rules Ionia's court. I journey'd on, and reach'd the Carian shore, There in a Rhodian vessel I embark'd Bound for the port of Near Athens. Sunium. Adverse gales Drove us to Malea southward, and again Doom'd me to cruel bonds a wretched prey.— The rest were mingled with the Helot band Except a few, whom their more wealthy friends Thought fit to ransom, as for me, thou seest My fate and knowst my fortune since!— Sem. Thy tale Would call attention from the dead, yet still Seems it not strange that here you waste away The precious hours of action, when a voice Like thunder, calls thee to forsake those woods And save desponding Greece! Asp. Yet wonder not! My fate, has fixt me here.—You know my birth.— Deep interest in your fortunes, and your wrongs A sympathizing pang to see your woes, Rooted me to this soil like yonder oaks That wave so awful to the midnight gale. I saw a manly spirit far diffus'd Among your tribes.—With transport I perceiv'd That nothing but religion's mighty charm Was wanting to enflame the nascent spark And form that influence, whose potent spell Gives the due energy. A short exertion In old Messenia's tribes, to free their hands I knew, would turn the balance, and incline Laconia's lords to think on moderate terms As yet too haughty far.— Sem. Great are thy views And laudable! Already Athens sends To warm us with the hope of present aid And present freedom! Asp. Would to all the gods Another Envoy had been chosen! I then Had not been led to this disast'rous tale.— Sem. I sought it not. Asp. Yet thou alone compell'st The sad recital.— Sem. I compell! I know not The purport of thy words!— Asp. Mistake me not— I saw thee on a precipice—I knew The dangers of that honey'd tongue, that flows With Aspics deadly venom,—tho' disguis'd Beneath the sweets of Hybla!— Sem. What to me The venom, or its sweets? Dost thou presume Upon my weakness, measur'd by thine own Or a few whispers, by the dubious ear, Heard indistinctly in the midnight hour? The business of a list'ner ill accords With all thy pomp, and high pretext of office? From an ignobler passion, low surmise, Thy seeming friendly caution came! Asp. Semanthe, I can forgive thee—but thou wrong'st me much. Time long has heal'd the deep corrosive wound, And I have too much pride to court a man, Who now, perhaps, contemns me. No.—Those groves, That tomb shall be my witness, that, for me, The secret of my birth and sex shall rest Unknown. Unless it be, perhaps, thy choice To give this Greek the means to triumph o'er A maid, who once had not disgrac'd his hand —Even in her fall. But tho' to me, my love Was death, my wand'rings may to Greece procure The glorious means of harmony and peace Thro' her unequall'd states. Sem. I scorn the office, And for Messenia's state my zeal would glow, Perhaps, as warm as yours! Asp. Then lay your hand Upon your heart; for, on that pulse that moves Your snowy bosom, now, even now, perhaps, Thy father's, and his people's weal depends— A worthy youth, Philemon, is his choice For thee, already to the royal stem Ally'd, and powerful in his vote, among The tribes of old Messenia. Let thy voice Confirm thy father's will! Like balmy Peace, When first she harmoniz'd the new-made world, Thou breath'st sweet concord thro' the loyal bands, That, on thy brother's doom, look up to thee, And on thy choice, to fix a nation's weal! —Philemon is thy father's choice. To thee, Perhaps our envoy may pretend, elate With his Athenian birth, and offer'd aid. He has a specious person, and the means To gain the coldest heart. Apollo's grace, The lip of Hermes, and the port of Mars. But trust not to his vows!— Philemon's spirit soars above the pitch Of his obscure and servile doom. The swains Revere him as their leader to the field After Alcander's fall. His name is dear, Even as the life-blood to their heart. Should he, Admit the bane of dark surmise, his pride Might make him raise a faction in the tribes, Merely to thwart his rival, and undo All that the gods and Athens have perform'd For freedom and Messenia. Thus the fate Of a whole people were perhaps involv'd In his dread efforts of revenge; Sem. From thee Those precepts? I accountable to thee For aught I do? And thou, dost thou pretend To read my heart?—Alas! thou only show'st Thine own too plain. Beneath the friendly mask Of patriotic zeal! shalt thou, a stranger, Feel for my country more than I? Should fate, Ordain by me, in closer league to join Ascending Athens, and our sinking state, Shall I oppose it? But it is not mine, Nor thine, alas! but the Messenian cause. It is a father's fiat shall determine For me! To thee and thine officious zeal I give its due of gratitude! No more— But, heed this friendly caution: When a friend Taxes thy wisdom for advice, employ Thy choicest stores of prudence in her cause, And all th'experience of thy wand'rings gain'd.— —But should his modesty or pride deny The expedience—proffer not too rashly thou Thy service, lest he spurn it, and deny Belief to thy romantic tale of love, Of exile, and of Asiatic honours! Asp. Be it as thou and they decide. For me, I might have err'd thro' zeal. Even Honesty Is oft misguided, and some bitter dregs, Tho' wholesome, mingle in the needful cup Of counsel! Seman. As for me, 'tis not of import What thy designs may be; at thy best leisure Frame thy apology! But other cares Demand my absence hence. [Exit. Asp. Alone. Go where thou wilt. Go! where thy passions hurry thee along. Perhaps, where Ruin lurks. Ha!—Is it thus, That poor Messenia's public friends avow'd, Consult her safety; to ferment the storm, That slumbers yet in peace; and to confound The firm confederacy, (just at the point To close) with new convulsions? Be it so! —But I am not in apathy so school'd, So chill'd with stoic maxims, as to see Another reap the harvest of my toil, And triumph in my tears, perhaps with pity, Insulting pity, to deride my wrong!— —Ere she possesses him, first perish all Messenia, Sparta, with their hopes and claims In one wide ruin, sinking to the fiends!— The raging flame that in my bosom glows Shall burn down every obstacle, to find him!— —But let me yet be calm, and temper well My plans with cautious prudence, so to guard Public and private ends at once! For her, I know she dare not yet disclose my trust, For that would tell her love, enflame the rage Of wrong'd Philemon, and incense her sire To rouse the storm I mean to lay. But see, Her lover comes to seek her. To her PHILEMON. Asp. Hail, Philemon! You come not, if I read your looks aright, To water with desponding tears, the urn Of him that slumbers here! What, tho' his fall Seem'd, like an earthquake, to disjoint the frame Of new-cemented freedom; yet you stood, And, like Alcides, plac'd your mighty hand Against th'impending ruin! Now on thee Our tribes rely; on thee, thy godlike sire, The father of thy race, Alcides, bends A parent's eye! and with the scrutiny Of heavenly minds, observes thy rising thought— Applauds the bright ideas, as they form In glorious schemes of freedom like his own!— And marks thy soaring soul, the progeny Of his great mind, as this majestic port, That marks the fam'd Herculean race! Phil. Such praise From such cælestial lips, (tho' yet by me Unearn'd,) I look on as a stimulant In that illustrious course, which heaven's behest Calls on me now to enter!— Asp. True, brave youth.— I had not so addrest thee, but I know That thou hast much to do—and much to suffer. Phil. Talk'st thou of suffering to a slave.—Alas! We smile at sufferings—we have suffer'd long! What, but the keenest sufferings could impell A multitude, to wish their plagues exchanged For the worst fiends that iron-handed war Brings in her hideous train? To wish the foe Already in our fields, our vineyards all Our harvests and our hamlets wrapt in flames That, in the conflagration we might 'scape Woes more intolerable? The whips, the scorns The contumelious, wanton injuries Of proud unfeeling Sparta?—I have seen And felt too much of this to be appall'd With dread of suffering violence! Besides We now have little to suspect of harm.— Even danger smiles upon us!—The Athenians By their late envoy, send most flattering terms, If true. Asp. To him your debt of gratitude Is ample, and demands a due return. Phil. As how.— Asp The fair Semanthe to his arm.— Phil. 'Tis true, my friend, and while the life-blood springs Thro' this warm heart, I live to thank him. Asp. She Already has repaid him life for life! But for her intervention, now perhaps His blood had stain'd our Altars, and her prayers Were offer'd up with fervour! Had they rose For thee, I think she had not breath'd the vow With deeper energy! and, when they met Their due return.—Say, didst thou mark her eyes? What transport there! but thou, I think, wast absent. Phil. disturbed. She has a feeling heart. Asp. And now my friend, Think what thy country claims from thee, thy birth Demands no common proof of public love! Even should it cross thy dearest hopes, and blast The joy most native to thy heart. Phil. My heart Is all my country's.—Is there ought she claims But to stand foremost in the day of peril And sill the fallen Alcander's place? Asp. For that A common warriour might suffice!—but he Whose energy of soul aspires to lead A people in the arduous paths of fame Must lead them first in virtue: his example Must foster those bright sparks of public love And fan them to a flame, instruct them how To quell their petty, selfish views, and feel For all. Else let them never hope to form A state conspicuous in the list of nations! 'Tis this, and this alone, that breathes around That sacred ardour whose felt influence Wakes in the general breast no common sense Of public good, that emulative glow By which the Spartans and Athenians rose Conspicuous rivals in the lists of fame Like two bright suns, in one resplendent sphere! Phil. Why this harangue to me? does Athens claim More than a just alliance? Asp. What she claims I know not.—But, if aught of heaven descend; To this once favour'd bosom.—Even from thee That sacrifice the gods expect, which gives Concord and safety to Messenia's tribes!— Phil. Is there a rival chief that claims my post? —Let him produce his claims!—And judge me then If public love, or selfish ends inspire Philemon's views!— Asp. There is—but arm thy soul With patience—one, whose wishes interfere With thine.— Phil. Mean'st thou the young Athenian? Asp. Yes.— He claims no post of honour, but aspires To more. Phil. Semanthe's love? Asp. Think not of love. Think, should'st thou plead thy prior claim, the links Of new alliance with the Attic state, He may dissolve. His faction governs there Once every moon. Phil. Is Athens then a tyrant? Claims she from us, what Sparta durst not claim, With our own hands to pierce our bleeding hearts, And rend them from our bosoms? Then, for us, 'Tis better far to cherish, as our lives, Our antient vassalage, than court new lords! Our-masters hid their guilt in conscious night, And came, like prowling wolves, beneath the moon, To waste our hamlets, and profane our woods With secret murthers! But our new allies Resolve to hunt us in the face of day, If this be true! Asp. Think what your country claims. Phil. My country! Does she then command to yield Our dearest rights, for which alone we live, The priceless boon of heaven, domestic bliss? Is this the bright example I am called To shew our swains? to teach our trampled slaves New lessons of subjection, meaner proofs Of low submission? This our haughty lords, In all their hey-day of prosperity Yet never dar'd! Nay, take my hated life! For what is life when every comfort flies? Why should I crawl on earth, contemn'd and scorn'd, An impotent example of the pride And pity of my foe? O thou, Hercules. stern god, From whom I draw my being, with contempt Repay my fervent prayer, when I disgrace Thy name, by such debasement of thy blood! I am not yet so friendless. Her old sire, The good Aristodemus, will support My claim, tho' all the legions, all the fleets Of Athens leave us naked to the foe! Our friends of Helice are on their march. Asp. My friend, be calm! nor with ungovern'd passion Disturb the new-form'd league. The haughty lover May yet relent! Phil. And shall I owe to him The favour of her hand? Thou seem'st to doubt— But I am fixt for certainty or death!— Asp. Yet—yet be cautious. Let us sound the flood Before we take the fatal plunge. Be calm— It may be yet we dread too much! Phil. From her!— From her I go to learn my doom, and spy, If in her cold, averted look I read A changing heart. Asp. Meantime, be mine the care To sound her lover. Here we meet again To sit in judgment on our country's fate. End of the Second Act. ACT III. [Scene I.] Scene.—An open space in Sparta, before a prison. EUDEMON—PHÆBIDAS. Eud. 'Tis now, oh Phæbidas! we feel the loss Of brave Androcles! By th'eternal gods Some fiend with folly and pernicious-rage Dashes our counsels! Both our kings at once You know, are absent, on the frontier bounds Watching at every pass the coming foe Like some pale shepherd, on a rock, forlorn With stunn'd ear list'ning to the land-floods roar That threats to desolate the plenteous year!— Our Ephori in mute despondence sit Or with vile brawls disturb the deep debate— By heaven! to abject Helots all are turn'd!— Some god has robb'd us of our better minds And given them to our slaves!—In yonder woods Like nobler savages they growl for freedom And Athens listens to their awful voice Delighted! Nay, they say, her envoys there Manage, with skill refin'd, the dreadful strain And pitch the horrid note so loud and shrill That nations tremble at the din!—O thou Great Hercules. lion-tamer! teach thy torpid sons How to subdue this monster of the groves That yells for carnage! Phæb. From the northern hills Messenia's exiles on the sounding shore Of Helice and Bura, boldly spread Their Ensigns to the wind, and, but some omens Withhold them, it is fear'd, that, long ere now By fatal instinct they had found their friends Who spurn their chains in old Amyclæs vale! O thou, that o'er the unseen world of horrors Rulest paramount, and hurl'st thy dreadful spells Thro' the scar'd soul, which, like the spreading plague Catches from man to man, till armies fly Before embattled nothings.—grant thine aid Transfer thy terrours from the Spartan mind And send them (like yon fogs that roll away Over the dawning hills) upon our foes Or all is lost!— Eud. By Jove it must not be! Was it for this the Spartan glory rose So formidable to the nations round Like a red comet o'er the trembling world That the vile hand of a revolted slave Should pluck it from the stars, and tread it out Like an extinguish'd lamp whose oil is spent? —And now, I know, some cold-blood compromise Is our dull subject of debate!—for me I always blamed the stern and rigid laws Which, not content with unremitting toil Prest from our groaning slaves the vital flood Mixt with their tears,—but, to submit, to sue For league with them, what is it; but to blend The name of Lacedemon with the dregs Of mankind, who along our fruitful fields Clank the vile chain of bondage?—If we fall— Why—let us fall like Spartans, like the lion Which our brave father slew, and not like dogs That crouch beneath the blow, and let their lords Twist the suspending cord around their necks And drag them to their doom—if by their aid We face the war, oh! never let us hope Again to bend them to their ancient state Of tame fervility! for settled peace And unassuming, calm timidity That scarcely seem'd to writhe beneath the scourge Expect the brow of bold rebellion rais'd At every fancy'd wrong! our quiet groves Profan'd with midnight meetings, when they deem Some privilege infring'd, or right withheld— —And shall we teach their sacrilegious eyes To pry into the mystic things of state To peep behind the scene, and find, that we (Whom, with implicit reverence, like the gods, For ages they have worship'd) are but men Subject like them to fear, the common prey Of every mutinous passion? Phæb. Is there aught In kindness, love, and mutual offices Of friendship, and of favour, to command Their mutual confidence and love? If not Society is but a rope of sand To be untwisted by the coming breeze! Had we, by nobler maxims, rul'd our slaves They now had wall'd us, like a mound of brass Or measur'd equal steps with you to meet Th'insulting foe! But we, alas! forgetting That we ourselves are men, and own'd, with them A common nature, have deprav'd ourselves, And them to savages, by uncouth deeds Of cruelty, of wrong, and violence! Eud. Had these more friendly maxims been adopted In other times! But now, what would they seem But the result of abject fear? The state Seems to prefer thy reasoning. Fare thee well. We meet no more, till this important crisis Is past, for on the winged moments ride The doom of Lacedæmon! [Exit, Phæb. Alone. Now, may heaven Second my purpose! If I reason right, The means are yet my own, (if duly us'd) To reconcile those fell domestic foes. —God of Cyllene! teach my lips the art Of soothing rage to harmony! Apollo! With thine own magic numbers tune my voice, Like thine own son's, who charm'd the silent woods To listen and obey. O bid me touch The sacred spring of sympathy, the source Of every noble sentiment, and warm To glorious growth, the full expanding mind Like the blest touch of thy benignant beam! [Exit. SCENE II. The inside of a Prison. ALCANDER —ALONE. I wonder what delays my doom so long? This terrible suspence is worse than death. Were I, in any other's power but his Whose brother fell by me, I should incline To hope they meant remission. But they now Spend their invention in new kinds of torture. —Perhaps they have found out my birth, and here Detain me, as an hostage for the faith Of our oppressed helots. Or, they mean, By menaces to me, of torments new, Unheard of pains, and terrible as those Inflicted on the Titans by the rage Of angry Jove, to bend the Helots down To tame submission! This, if this they mean, Would double every pang! Shall I, the heir Of great Alcides, in ignoble bonds, Pine here in hopeless gloom, while on my breath, (Precarious tenure!) hangs the destiny Of poor Messenia, like the gossamer, That trembles at the breeze! Will not my foes Thus hold me, till extremity of age?— Till with my slow, declining spirit, sinks The languid flame of liberty, subdued By this rare spell of despotism refin'd, This fraudful policy? or, like the forms (Fashion'd in wax by wizard's plastic power Of those alive) by slow consuming fires, In secret waste, while those, whose shapes they wear Confess the horrible decay, nor know The cause! I cannot—cannot bear the thought With patience! I shall find some means to send My last, my dearest testament to those Who mourn for me! I'll bid them look to him, Who weds the last of the Herculean race, Their leader now! For me, let tortures rend, Or slow consuming sorrow waste my frame.— —Let them look on me as a sacrifice Devoted for my people! Could I think They meant to make me a degraded tool, A living instrument, a mere machine, To play upon a people's hopes and fears, And tame a gallant nation on the verge Of freedom, to the galling scourge again, This hand would soon decide my doom! But hark, Perhaps this instant moment turns the scale! Enter a MAN masqued. Alc. I thank thee. Thou art come, I hope, to speed A wretche's doom, who trembles not to see The welcome steel, that sends his soaring soul To mingle with his fathers! He exults At instant fate, but dreads the dungeon's gloom, And the slow wasting chain! Be quick and merciful, And he will thank you! Spar. Follow me! I come To give thee all thy wish; but in this cell Thy fall were too obscure—thou must be made A fearful warning to thy fellow-slaves, And teach a wholesome lesson of obedience. Alc. Then I were short of half my hopes! Art thou More than a man, to force me hence? I see not Who comes to aid thee, and a wretch can die Even here! I will not leave this penal spot, (Unless the rigorous hand of force compell me) A spectacle to Sparta's haughty sons, And poor Messenia's suffering tribes! Thou seem'st Irresolute. But dread me not—my bosom Is open to the blow, and I shall bless The hand that lays me here, unseen, unknown! For well proud Sparta knows, how I'm belov'd By the afflicted Helots, and they bear Enough already, not to have their woes Enhanc'd by mine! Spar. I'll try a stronger charm To lure thee hence. [Unmasks.] Say, art thou now convinc'd That there's no hopes for thee, and that my power Can call a speedy guard to force you hence? Alc. Ha! Phæbidas! I would not lift my hand Against thy life; nor had thy brother fallen By me, but in my own defence! Phæb. I know it— And, probably, my knowledge even of thee Exceeds thy thoughts! Before this period, long Thy slaughter had aton'd a brother's blood. —But, let me not be thought to want the touch Of kindred feeling, when I own his rage Deserv'd, and drew his fate upon himself. He lov'd his country—but his fiery zeal Was indiscreet; he scorn'd to try the means Of generous policy, but thought to sweep, By the strong current of resistless power, All that oppos'd his favourite views, away; He thought, by terror, to obtain, what love, Humanity, and mercy had ensured! Alc. Oh had such generous sentiments been his, He now, perhaps, had liv'd, and thousands more, (Whose life-blood, shed in wanton sport, distain'd Our moonlight vales) had now enjoy'd the day. But other policy prevail'd, and Sparta Learns, in her turn, to weep! Phæb. Stern Justice claims Blood, for his blood! Alc. I know it, and I stand Prepar'd to meet my doom! Let it be sudden, And leave all retribution to the gods! Perhaps, even they may think a people's wrongs A full atonement for their sins of old, And turn the scale of vengeance! Phæd. What canst thou Expect from me in justice, call'd by heaven And earth, the avenger of a brother's blood? Alc. It matters not what Justice claims:—to Justice Sparta has long been deaf! But for my fate, I well have earn'd it, and I count it fame! I might have led my Helots with an arm Of flesh! but now my disembodied soul, With all the Manes of th'immortal line! Shall fire the van, and marshal them to vengeance! Phæb. Canst thou, deprest with bondage and with blows, An abject Helot, burn with patriot love; And canst thou glory in thy fall, to soothe An empty hope of raising servile souls To cherish liberty? And what from me, A Spartan born, will honour claim to match Our haughty boasts of yet unequall'd virtue? Alc. It calls on blood for blood, a nobler policy, Than midnight murthers, unprovok'd and cool, Weeding the noblest of our youth away, Thro' base, unmanly dread: the men, whose spears In this dread crisis, in the battles' edge Had stood the shock of Athens! But, alas! Why need I argue with a son of Sparta, On justice, and on virtue? Phæb. All, perhaps, Are not the advocates of cruelty As thou presumest. There are, who scorn to wield The scourge; there are who would disdain to hunt Their slaves in midnight walks, with ruffian blade; There are, who wish to raise their country's glory On the broad basis of humanity, And mutual deeds of love! Alc. Where do they hide When the stern mandate goes abroad to lay Our fields in blood, and bid our matrons weep? Phæb. Alas! amid the cry of savage fury Their milder voice is lost! Their reason reels Amid the gusts of prejudice and passion, One only godlike privilege remains, By private influence to serve the state. Unseen benevolence, like the blest gods, Who, tho' to us invisible, dispense Their benefits around us. That to me, (Mean as I am) this boon is not deny'd, I count my greatest glory! Alc. Say, canst thou Change the determin'd purpose of yon wolves? Expell the savage lust for blood? Command The tyger to grow tame, and in his paw Dandle the kid? Say, canst thou purge away The wrongs, deep-character'd, that glow for years In the dark memory, till fermenting long, They burst their way in rage? Canst thou do this? —Then say thou art a god, and tell yon star Of morn to rise no more, and bid the dawn Forget her hour to shine! Phæb. I can do more! I can at will command the world within, Can bid my passions in their full career Obey the check of Reason! when the blood Of a fallen brother loud for vengeance calls, And raises every holy sentiment Of kindred sympathy, within my breast, I can attend my country's deeper call (A sound more solemn to the purged ear Of Reason) and can bid his murtherer—go, Free as the winds, to bless a weeping father, And turn a people's tears to joy! Alc. To me!— To me this unexpected boon! I dream. From Phæbidas! A Spartan! Can it be?— Phæb Doubt not thy sense, or my fidelity, In what I promise. Thou, (at my request) Wast given to me in custody, as one Whom all our Ephori, with justice deem'd The most concern'd to see a brother's blood Aton'd at full:—thou'rt number'd with the dead. For Rumour, (so suborn'd by me) proclaims it.— —I see the conflict of thy soul! I know Thy power among thy friends! Alc. Tell me at once On what conditions must I purchase life! —Are they not hostile to my people's cause? If I must buy a few short hours to breathe A momentary privilege to view The blessed sun (if I dare lift my eyes To that prime orb) at the detested price Of using my hereditary sway To rob Messenia of her lofty claims, If this devoted voice, to slavery tun'd Must lure the slaves to thraldom down again From that exalted height to which they soar'd, Take my devoted blood—'tis freely given, Ere I seduce them to their bonds again!— Such life I scorn—altho' with generous views, With pure, abstracted, public love bestow'd, I must reject it! rather give me death, Than life on terms like these! Thou lovest thy country, Already have I seen you sacrifice Thy feelings for a brother's fate. Of me And of my feeling, judge, as of thine own And sooner give me death than life, if life Be branded with the shame of base revolt From poor Messenia's cause, the cause of man! Phæb. Could you confide in Sparta, if my prayers Prevail'd, even to relax your bondage? Alc. Never!— Never! her inborn persidy and pride Would ne'er relent to those she trode so low! Nor will I ever give my voice for less Than equal liberty, unqualified Alliance!—less were dangerous, for this spirit Of mutiny has so provok'd our lords They'll take their time for vengeance, if we swerve A single moment, from the manly bent— Then reconcile my fighting duties all And take my forfeit life! Phæb. Then every hope Were lost at once—thou bear'st a charmed life— Thy very hairs are sacred—all the gods Shed round thy favour'd form an hallow'd awe! Curst be the hand that wounds thee, when thou art The solitary spell that holds our tribes In short, precarious concord! When you fall Then, then perdition with alternate rage Swallows her double prey! The sires that glow At Sparta's crimes would blaze to swift revenge Break down the barriers of our trembling state And Athens and Messenia soon would sweep Our very name away! Already they believe you dead—your fall (So far from damping their resolves) sublimes The flame to tenfold fury—there is left No hope, but from thy influence! Alc. Just gods What shall I think! on what resolve. Phæb. Relent! Alc. Honour, my country, and my name forbids! Phæb. One only method then for me remains— Dreadful—but glorious—to retract my words Given for thy liberty my soul disdains!— I here dismiss thee to thy native woods To join thy friends—no bonds—no tyes—but those That fasten mind to mind, the links of honour, Of virtue, friendship,—shall I say—of gratitude? No—I remit the debt. Thou owest me nought.— —Go and relume the flame of liberty Go—triumph in my country's fall—the light Of Greece, and glory of those latter times!— For oh! her fall is certain! Alc. Let me seek The Spartan lords, and give my forfeit life! Phæb. No—there is one way left,—no more but this— Proud Athens—you, her allies, press our state On every hand around—thy single death But added to the rising beam, would turn The scale to our destruction! To the field Your kindred armies from the northern bounds Already bend their march, and burn to join The war.—Two thousand Helots of thy tribe Burst from our bleeding bowels, (like the train That hunt their scaly mother in the seas, Of Sicily,) and spread destruction round Answering the havoc of external war With threats of desolation.—What is left For me? Shall I survive to bear the blame Of letting loose a man, sworn to destroy My country?—No! Since all my eloquence Is vain, to teach you mercy, here I stand Prepar'd, in the devouring chasm, to meet The anger of the hostile gods for all. That moment then that sees you head your bands In glittering steel, once more we meet in arms! Alc. Deem'st thou me such a monster as to lift A spear, against that generous breast, which gave Life, liberty, and all to him, who slew His brother? Phæb. No.—I would not stain thy sword With blood of mine, nor taint thy better mind, Nor bid one conscious pang thy bosom wring For me! The gods, and Fate will find a lance To finish a devoted life! Alc. Devoted! Phæb. Last night, with solemn sacrifice and prayer To all th'infernal gods, that claim the soul Of those, that for their country fall, my doom Was fixt beyond recall! I know not then Whether my prayers had power with you or not To gain thee to the common good. I yet Would try the means; as they have fail'd, I stand Devoted for my country, at the sound, At the first trump, at the first flight of spears That sing along the sky, expect to see The incense of my smoking blood ascend Pure to the ambient skies, thence to draw down Accumulated plagues upon our foes, In this dread rite devoted all with me.— Yet I forgive my blood to thee, as freely As I forgave my brother's. And, by heavens! I triumph in the glorious chance that gives My happy name, to after times, enroll'd With Iphigene and Hæmon. Devoted for the Trojans and Thebans. Alc. Yet, oh yet Spare me this conflict, let my blood atone! Phæb. By heaven, I would not to my king forego The glorious privilege. Farewell, at once! —Nay go!— Longer should I detain you. Danger waits, Perhaps, to intercept your flight! The star Of morning sparkles o'er yon piny hill, And on Eurotas' banks, the morning bird Laments her antient loss. Away! away Before Suspicion's eagle-eye awakes.— When next we meet—how shall that meeting be?— Death will be there, and Discord, civil rage And the dire conflict of contending nations! —Thou then, perhaps, may'st triumph to behold Red Vengeance, with th'accumulated wrongs Of many a summer arm'd, ride thro' our ranks, Scattering confusion, havoc, and dismay Where'er she goes. But then—memember me— For ere the battle's whirlwind sweeps along The line, I am no more! If conquest then Attend your arms. And if my vows should fail To gain the gods.—indulge not thou the sword Too far! Reflect on Sparta, and revere Those rites, and that far-celebrated soil Which bred Leonidas! when thou beholdst The mighty mother prostrate, gently raise her Respect her reverend hairs, and think of peace! Cherish her then remains, and join your power With her sad bands in one cemented league To check th'Athenians overweening pride! Alc. Yet hear me Phæbidas! I cannot go On such conditions. Phæb. Stay then, and be lost! No more—but think on me—begone, begone, The day will overtake us, hence—avaunt I hear the tread of early passengers. [Exeunt severally. End of the Third Act. ACT IV. ASPASIA —SOLUS. Ha—Empire! glory! well! the time has been That love had charms for this Athenian youth! But now, a prey to wild, ambitious thoughts He dreams of founding kingdoms on the ruins Of old Messenia, dreams of future kings From his Semanthe to descend! O fall How low! to court a slave! but he, alas Vain of his splendid talents, holds in scorn The voice of reason! Little does he think What means are ours to cross him, when he soars An eagle-flight to glory! Shall it be That I must tamely see my ancient right Seiz'd by another? No—whoever scorns My prayer, shall feel my power! What! to retire And, like a votarist, weep in secret cell My ruin'd fortunes, and my blasted hopes, Blasted by him! while, with contemptuous pity To his young bride he tells the hapless tale Of my disastrous love. What tye, what claim Compells me to forget such wrongs?—Not Athens Proud Athens, from whose sanguinary laws I hardly 'scap'd with life! Nor this new realm This rising state The Messenians or Helots., beneath the guardian wing Of Athens to be form'd, can claim from me Regard or reverence! Shall I stoop to build A rivals throne, and mourn my abject lot In low obscurity? Had he adopted My safe proposal, he, with me had sway'd Messenia's sceptre.—But I still can shew him A sample of my power—then if he dare To thwart me further, if he still persists In causeless infidelity, and scorns Those gods that heard his oft repeated vows Then, Discord, Rage, and Tumult at their heels Shall mingle with that syren minstrelsie Which sooths his mind to short, fallacious peace! Soon shall he hear an unexpected call To start his soul to madness! This fair slave, Believ'd the fabling message in the name Of this young, cruel false one! fraud with fraud Dissimulation meets her sister fiend With a like gorgon mask—her passion leads Semanthe to the snare, and she absconds.— Her sudden flight awakes Philemon's rage; By jealousy inspir'd, he turns the blame On his proud rival, of the seeming rape. Then, then the buffled lover, in his turn Might call to memory his forgotten vows! And—should Semanthe ne'er return, the right Of old Messenia's royalty reverts To me, and Athens would afford her aid, I have th'ascendant o'er this people's minds Already—then Ambition, Love, Revenge Were satisfied—but see! Philemon comes The father—and a stranger! Now my charms Begin to work.— [Retires. Scene Continues. ARISTODEMUS, ALCIBIADES, PHILEMON, SPARTAN AMBASSADOR, AMPHIDAMAS, and HELOTS. ARISTODEMUS —TO THE AMBASSADOR. We doubt thee not. Thou bear'st the proper ensigns Of thine authority—our fears extend Far beyond thee.—Of Lacedemon's faith We now dispute not, nor their solemn oaths Nor leagues, pretend to question—their demeanour To others, nought imports to us. We know (Fallen as we are beneath the rank of men) That we are far too mean to hope or trust To peace on equal terms. Do shepherds deign To make alliance with the curs that tend Their flocks? or bind themselves in solemn league To mend their offals, or remit their stripes?— They do not think us worthy that respect Due to their fellow creatures, had not fear Taught them another lesson! and shall we Trust to their solemn oaths, tho' doubly bound By all the burning thrones beneath the deep? Spar. Helot, you have your choice! it ill becomes A Spartan, like a fuppliant slave, to bend To any power on earth, much less to thine Come thou, or Athens to our gates at once With new conditions, on the lances point We give an answer! Arist. Tarry yet awhile— The crisis calls not such resolves—to me Now bending to the tomb, my passions cool'd By age's wintry hand, it scarce belongs To undertake, at such a time, the charge Of a high-spirited nation, yet my counsels May serve to mitigate the headlong haste Of thoughtless youth. Thy reasons have been heard And now our friend of Athens claims his time To speak—our Helots then shall arbitrate The question for themselves—their liberty (If ever independence be their lot) Must be no fleeting shadow, no proud name No glittering phantom to beguile their grasp! It must be palpable, well known, secure Founded on the broad base of full consent Not to be shaken by the potent breath Of foreign tyrants or domestic pride— Now speak, Athenian! Alcib. Well didst thou conclude Thy charge, old man! the spirit of our state, That liberal energy that warms our counsels Already glows in each Messenian breast, A people, in deliberation join'd With their elected king! What more remains Than—let them boldly speak their thoughts and tell If they will longer crouch beneath the scourge Of their proud lords, and bear the cumbrous load Of insults, wounds, and death; or strike at once At the tall fabric of Laconian pride, Nor wait the tardy and deliberate hand Of time, to sweep the mighty columns down —The very moment warns—if now they lose The golden opportunity, let sleep Oblivious, ever seize them! Now the tide Returning with full sway, beneath the rule Of time and stern necessity, invites The spreading sail! nor let the louring threat Of gathering storms, deter the daring keel From this distinguish'd voyage! now the flag Of Athens leads to freedom, and to fame! The man, who trembles at the summer, cloud That wanders o'er the main, nor dares to loose His cautious anchor, ne'er will reach the coast Where glory calls him to her opening fane! —Then why delay? Will yon diurnal lamp Arrest his burning wheels, till you resolve To seize the precious moment? Will the seasons Obey your call in their perennial dance? Does rain or sunshine bless your waving fields At your request? or do your harvests bend Whene'er you chuse to reap the golden grain? No—in continual revolution still The stormy and serene in turn succeed. And all our earnest supplications fail To check the stern approach of rugged winter With all his furious flaws!—'Tis so with you! Your glorious harvest now is ripe, and calls For the keen sickle. But, if torpid sloth Or smooth persuasion slack the nerve of steel Or ease delude, perhaps to-morrow's sun Brings the contagious mildew, or the storm That lays your hopes all waste!—Oh—if a thought Worthy of men, has ever warm'd your breasts! If ye are aught above the herds that graze— Employ the moment!—nay, the beasts that range The woods, despise the yoke, and, on the man Who madly ventures on their gloomy walks Glare independence and disdain! they know How, on the foreseen danger, to prepare The means to guard their young: they want the power Of combination, and of mutual aid Yet they preserve their liberty! they claim The forest, and the den their own! they spurn The chain, and when they fall, in open fight They breathe away their generous souls! But ye Possess the means they want, by mutual signs Each others thoughts to know, to calculate Each others strength, and brood for years before On the great scheme of vengeance and of glory; These are prerogatives of men, they're yours If ye be men! Amph. We are,—but give us arms And you shall find us in the bloody fields No mean allies,—we do not boast the blood Of Hercules in vain!— Alcib. Ye shall not want them— Brave men! ye shall not want the means to meet Your haughty foes,—our fleet that rides at hand Waits but the signal to disbark her stores And furbish all your files, that your own groves Shall wonder at your glory, when ye run In full career along your gloomy glades And glitter to the day, like the young snake That casts her old disguise in early spring And o'er the green sward rolls in spiry pride A rival to the sun! The fearful swain Flies his approach, and runs to shelter near. So will the Spartans tremble at the view When first your glittering files become the field! Spar. The Spartans never tremble; they may fall— But dreadful is their fall, even to their foes. Alcib. That will be seen, when Athens to the field Sends your revolted subjects! Phil. to Alcib. Yes—to fight Your battles—think not, proud Republican, With all your fire-new gloss of eloquence To varnish o'er our shame! Low as we are Better to be the thralls of Sparta still Than tools of haughty Athens! we, 'tis true Too deeply feel the cruel, galling chain, And many years have bent us to the yoke! But fate, and ill success in arms, impos'd The hard conditions! we, before we feel Try'd the decision of the spear, but now You bid us change our master, by the name Of liberty, beguil'd! Such is our change! For our hereditary lords, a crowd Of proud Athenian artizans: the sport Of every faction, whose imperious vote Might plunge us in the mines beyond the hope Of day? And now what glorious privilege Is ours? ye give us arms, ye nobly grant The post of danger—on the fearful edge Of battle you dispose us first, to blunt The keen Laconian blade, and labour down The first dread onset of the Spartan spear! They waste their fury on their slaves, and come Like a spent tyger on your level'd pikes An easy conquest. What does Sparta grant? The privilege of kinsmen, all the dues Of the Heraclidæ!—Her choicest bands Wait our enrollment in the files—from you We gain an empty title of allies To gild our chains!—but let the nations tell— Go—summons from the isles their envoys here They once were crown'd with liberty—let them Proclaim the blessed fruits of your alliance Taxation, robbery, violence and chains, Whate'er the ruffian in his rage inflicts! —Oh gracious heaven! are we reduc'd so low As to renounce the whip and madly chuse The chastisement of scorpions in its stead? Alcib. Who is this talker?—is it thus, Messenians? Ye suffer your sound reason to be warped By words without a meaning? your resolves Turn'd to the lane of children, by the breath Of a proud demagogue? Phil. Is that your plea?— Now see, as in a mirrour, how your state Is sway'd by factious breath! perhaps to day You vote us allies, and to-morrow, slaves, Just as the sky is louring or serene And a debauch, or surfeit sours your speakers. Or bribes allure them! Alcib. Heavens! what demons rule Our counsels now! O that the gods awhile Would stop the wheel of fate, whose mighty sway Bears down with it the Spartan state! We then From all the broad Ionian! and the isles From this to Asia, could produce such witness As soon would send the falsehood to the source That bred it! Phil. Yes,—we know the means too well— Nor make a question of your will, to bring False witnesses to sanction with their oaths Whatever you suggest. But say, thou traitor To public faith! What specimens already Have you not given us of your perfidy? You, an Ambassador, the public guardian Of a whole people's honour, thus, to lure A virgin from her home!—It calls aloud For vengeance! vengeance! Arist. Why this rage, my son! What has provoked such language! quickly tell What meanst thou! Phil. Too, too well my bursting tears Proclaim my meaning, and thy deep disgrace— Bid him,—yet ere he sends for delegates From the confederate isles to vouch his truth— —Bid him produce thy daughter! Arist. He—my daughter! Is she not safe within my lodge? Phil. That, time Will tell!—send to thy home, and seek her there Where I have sought in vain and—if she's found Call me a felon! an Athenian! one Who underneath the consecrated mask Of hospitality, with worse than sacrilege Plunders his host of his most valued gem! Alcib. By all the gods—by Nemesis and Jove Whoe'er thou art, thou wrong'st me, but I go— The terms, which you contemn, our conquering state Needs not to force on any! Tell thy tribes She needs not Helots aid! [Going. Arist. Yet stay, Athenian! You move not hence—but, as an hostage here We keep thee till my daughter's found [Seizing him. Alcib. To thee:— Hostage to thee! instant unhand me, slave! Or I will crush thee into dust! Arist. Indeed We yet are slaves, but soon, without the help Of Athens, we are called to lift our names With Spartans, and with men! If Sparta oft Wrong'd us, her wrongs were mixt with conscious night; Imperious, haughty as she was, she durst not Show the bold brow of injury by day Which thou, a delegate from Athens sent, Hast dar'd to do! Alcib. When thro' your gloomy groves Rages the hostile flame, when you behold Your hamlets smoaking, and your slaughter'd sons, Remember this!—your masters then in vain Will battle for their servants! These proud Spartans Already for fidelity and truth So fam'd! you thought not so, when in contempt Of their late edict, brave Alcander fell, Fell, by a midnight ruffian! Phil He, perhaps! By his precipitation earn'd his fate!— Had he but seen this day, thou hadst not now Presum'd as thou hast done! thy boiling blood Had paid for poor Semanthe's wrongs! Semanthe! Produce her! Traitor! Where hast thou conceal'd Thy theft? produce her! or this dagger drinks Thy gore! Alcib. Some demon sure, the friend of Sparta Confounds your minds! Phil. Think not with smooth address To baulk our just resentment!—or produce The virgin, or thou diest!—Why do I rave?— Perhaps her voluntary flight attends Thy faithful envoy to the Attic coast— And shall I waste my life in sighs for her? O father, pardon me! Arist. Afflicted youth! Be patient! she, perhaps, may still be found, She is not missing long. Phil. Too plain I saw Her alienated mind! Too soon I mark'd The signs of soft, seductive art! smooth villain! This dagger soon shall thank you for the deed! [Going to stab him. Arist. interfering. Yet hold! rash man! is this your vow'd respect For me, to violate this pledge, to me Committed? yet perhaps you know not all [As the struggle continues, enter Alcander, they all stand amazed. Arist. Alcander! dost thou live? or art thou sent From the blest realms to save our hands from blood? Oh! do not mock us with unreal hope— But say thou art my son! Alc. I am, I am, Father, Philemon! my assembled friends! All wondrous as it seems to see me here You do not bend your eyes upon a shape Form'd of the passing air. Behold, and feel It is Alcander's self! Arist. [Embracing him.] Mysterious powers! We saw thee dead! we saw thee stretch'd along The flaming funeral pile! how cam'st thou here? How shall we trust our eyes, that saw your corse All mangled o'er with wounds! yet view thee now Exulting in proud youth and health! Say, is it A dream! explain the miracle? Alc. Most easy!— A proud, vindictive man, Androcles nam'd, (Whom you may well remember, my free words At old Amyclæ's fane incenst,) pursued My homeward steps beneath the rising moon.— I was beforehand—for I fear'd his purpose And soon a trusty few in ambush laid Who gave him death, for me design'd! our hands In my known vesture soon disguised the dead And scar'd his face, to keep him long unknown And pass him for an Helot, (as his friends Were potent, proud, vindictive as the fiends) While in his Spartan garb I meant to 'scape, His brother Phæbidas, along the lawns With purpose to prevent him, had pursued His steps, but came too late, a chosen band Of Spartans follow'd him, their eager search Soon found me, with the recent marks of blood. Soon was I known—expecting instant death I stood collected. But, when pious grief For his fallen brother had given way, he spoke In milder mood “I know my brother's rage “Rose high, and nought but blood could quench the flame. “Helot, I doubt not, in thine own defence “You struck the blow. But shew me where his corse “Is now dispos'd.” My friends had borne him thence Nor could he, by our strictest search, be found. Arist. Not on Alcander, but Androcles then Our honours were bestow'd! Mysterious heaven. A slaughter'd Spartan fills the regal urn!— His ashes slumber with our Kings! but who Was conscious to the deed? will none reveal The secret? would our Helots see me spend Our sacred, incommunicable rites On the fallen carcase of a foe? Amph. To me The blame is due. 'Twas I the counsel gave. 'Twas I that led the party; hear my plea, Condemn then if you can! I knew Alcander Was led a captive, and my public love Led me to fear, lest, were his bondage known 'Twould quash our high resolves and make us pause Even on the spur of onset, much I fear'd His precious life might buy ignoble peace— I gave the counsel. I, by threats and prayers Bound the important secret on the souls Of that nocturnal party, till some blow Were struck, for freedom, and for fame. Alc. By heavens My generous friend! I thank thee! may my deeds Answer your lofty expectations! Arist. Tell O tell, how could you 'scape immediate death? Alc. He thought me stubborn, and, in harsher tone “Thou must with me, to answer as thou may'st “A deed so daring, else a brother's ghost “Would wander unaveng'd!” It nought avail'd For me to struggle with my fate. Confin'd In dungeon gloom, I long expected death— At last the moment came, that gave me life And liberty at once. Amph. Blest be the power That gave us such a leader! at a time When still the doubtful balance seems to play Twixt liberty and bondage! by yon sun, By all the powers that watch us as we soar From slaves to manhood, it consoles my heart That here thou stand'st to check the baleful spell Of them, who in the face of all the gods With painted passion bid these echoes tell Their zeal for liberty; while fell revenge While sordid avarice, and more sordid lust Cling to their dark'ned souls and lead them on— Them, and the brainless herd, to heavier chains Beneath their ancient lords! To Phil. I scorn your frowns As I detest your views! I know your heart The vile contracted seat of dark surmise And causeless jealousy! To thee I call Alcander! Thou, and thou alone, canst turn The tide that veers to slavish bonds again And check our spaniel habits! Phil. Rancorous slave! Did not this presence awe me, soon thy tongue Tho' agonizing in the pangs of death Should own thy hireling eloquence procur'd By Attic gold or promises! Arist. Be calm I charge you both—your frenzy interrupts A tale might claim attention from the grave. Alc. Something, the grave alone shall know, remains— Meantime, behold me here, free as the winds!— Without condition, bond, or oath, releas'd From death, to glad my friends, to lead, them on To conquest, if they dare the glorious toil! Alcib. Dare they? with Athens at their head, the gods Alone, shall point the limits of their claims. Alc. They best can tell their limits and their claims! Their prowess and their aids! but there are limits The checks of mind, which, like a magic spell Confine the warriours arm, and bind it fast As yonder trees, long wedded to the soil! Such are the links that drag me back to Sparta, Free as I seem; Free as the birds that sport In yonder boughs! But there are bonds, my friend, (Strong as the linked adamant) that chain The stern, relentless spirit to its purpose. Arist. What means my son? what tyes? Alc. Justice and honour. Honour, the sole possession, which is left Thy ruin'd house. I prize it though, beyond The mines of Asia! Arist. What a strain is this, That soars so high above the sober tenor Of mortal things! Explain yourself, my son! Alc. I have a friend in bonds—I will not live To have a father blush to see his son Breathe out his life, a forfeit to the laws Of honour, with a vile deserter's name! Arist. Must I then loose thee! late so lost, so found O spare thy father's aged locks! Too much Already have I borne! But this were death, Distraction! Alc. Oh! my father! can I live And see the man that sav'd me, fall a victim! Sav'd me, from worse than death, from torture! shame, And vile exposure after death, deny'd The rites of funeral?—No! Amphidamas! Thou never shalt reproach me with the name Of traitor to my fame. Even thou thyself Mayst take Philemon's place and mine, if fate Forbids him to be trusted! Arist. Say, what friend?— How grew the strange dilemma? are no means In heaven or earth allow'd us yet to solve This gordian knot, and save you? Alc. None, but such As you would spurn!—my generous friend is doom'd, Doom'd, in my stead, to drain the bitter bowl Which I expected. Arist. Curst alternative!— How could thy friend deserve it? did he give A volunteer, his life for thine? Alc. Enflam'd By patriot love, be, self-devoted, falls. For Sparta, if her tutelary gods Protect her not, and spare his valued life! Alcib. Aside. Devoted men! I see your headlong fall To ruin, and the moment seize, while doubt And perturbation hold your senses bound To steal from the approaching storm. [Exit. Arist. Is nought In possibility's wide range, to save His precious life, and yours? O tell me who And what he is? Alc. The brother of the man Who sought my life! he had me in his power And tho' both Piety and Vengeance call'd For retribution, yet he would not strike (Such his regard to Justice) as he knew His brother rush'd upon his fate, and call'd The deadly blow. He must not, shall not dye I will not breath on such conditions—no— Farewell my father, ye, my friends, farewell! And thou! Amphidamas! with constant care Cherish the vestal flame, and bid it burn Conspicuous, bright, as that which fires the souls Of your confederate Athens! Alc. Oh, my son, Did you not say, but now, that, should you fall, His life could not be sav'd? And must you perish In vain? Must poor Messenia's royal blood Be sold for nought? Alc. Alas! my hapless father! He falls a victim to th'infernal gods, With solemn rites devoted for the weal Of Sparta! If the powers below receive The sacrifice, with omens good; our fall Is the dire consequence, unless a life For you devoted, stop the fearful chasm That opens to receive us! Can I fall More glorious than for you, for liberty, For glory? Judge for me, Amphidamas, Plead with my father! Bid him throw aside The timid feelings of a partial sire, And glow, the patriot, and the upright judge, Unprejudic'd, unpassion'd! I, like him, Devote me for my country! Be my fame, My deathless fame, your new-adopted heir, And cherish it for me! Arist. Oh! yet my friends! Amphidamas! assist me to detain him!— Will ye permit your hero to return To certain fate? Helots. No—no—Our lives shall answer For his! Alc. Retire! my inconsiderate friends! Your kindness pains me. I must not be held, You may detain my body, but my soul Shall force its way! Phil. Is there no means allow'd? Amph. Alcander's self Mention'd but now, some other means! Alc. Yes—means Which you would be the first, Amphidamas, To spurn! 2 Hel. Amphidamas! and what is he, That he should sway our fixt resolves? We own No other but Alcander for our lord, After Aristodemus! We request With one assent, Alcander to declare What he proposes! Alc. It requires no sage To guess the means! Oh father! Oh ye Helots! Could ye forget your wrongs, could ye but know The deep distress of Sparta, hem'd around By foes at every pass, ye would relent, And join your bands to her's! Amph. Is it then so?— But fate has seal'd my lips. Alc. Let reason weigh Our merits, and our wrongs! the blest effects Of unexpected love, where Discord rag'd; And Gratitude's strong tyes, should we relent! Amph. I'll speak, altho' I perish.—Say, Alcander, What reason have we to confide in them, The ruling passion of whose lives has been But the continuance of unvary'd wrong, Oppression, murther, persidy, and lust? Alc. Send them a bold defiance! let my life Victim for victim, please the nether gods And gain conspicuous omens for the cause Of liberty and Athens! Helots. No—no—no No royal blood shall fall to please the powers Beneath—a meaner victim must suffice. Arist. What hostage do they give to prove their faith? Alc. They set me free, when in their power! Arist What oath? Have they appeal'd to any of the gods The founders of our common race? Alc. They have— Their Ephori before th'infernal gods With dreadful imprecations bound their souls To give us freedom, to inroll our youth ( The Helots used to attend the Spartans in the field as servants.Rais'd to the rank of Sparta's men at arms) In fam'd Laconia's bands—if you refuse This offer, nought remains, but I return To pay that forfeit life which honour claims! Arist. The people never will permit such proof Of your high spirit—but what document What public bond and signature confirm'd By due authority will you produce Of this alliance? Alc. Be th'alliance void Unless they give the solemn witness'd bond! Amph. Can reconcilement dwell with countless wrongs? Alc. And what would be th'effect of vengeance, say— But propagated vengeance, blood and death From sire to son deriv'd; if they could 'scape Impending ruin now? Should Sparta fall Would our condition be improv'd? our All Would then depend on Athens! say, could we Hope for a better station in her favour Than the subjected isles that mourn her yoke All o'er the wide Ægean? Nay, our state Were worse! We have no boistrous waves to guard Our trembling shores, but, hem'd with hostile tribes, Must live in trepidation, or subside To the dead level of our fellow slaves To slavery worse than now! But should we chuse The nobler province, to return, for wrongs, For violence, for treachery, and blood. Protection, friendship, in the dreadful hour When Sparta, trembling, looks to us for succour The genial seed of virtue would produce Immortal fruit! the tide of gratitude Would flow for ever, like Eurotas stream! The glorious deed would melt their stubborn souls Like fire to steel, and mould them into men, Else they were monsters, savages, unfit To live in harmony with men! The ills That, with close siege have hem'd them long around Ere now, have low'r'd their haughty crests, and taught The lessons of humanity—if not, They have less feeling than those aged trunks That own the touch of heaven's ætherial ray And spread their lofty honours to the gale! Amph. Must we confide in this precarious test? On this uncertain plank embark our all? Where does this worth, this gratitude reside On which we must rely? Alc. In Phæbidas! 2 Helot. Enough—enough—proceed, we all attend. Alc. Let us then, in the presence of the gods That smile on virtue, try upon our friends Nobly, the great experiment! do we Wish to subdue them?—Let us aim the blow Not at their bodies, but their minds—if still They feel not in their souls the generous deed They would defy the thunder—nay, the powers Of heaven, in dreadful synod met above Would muster all the enginry of heaven And in one general explosion, send Such miscreants from the world! Amph. Shouldst thou prevail And they for our beneficence, return Their usual contumely, how could you 'Midst Helots, lift your head, or dare to plead For Sparta, or yourself? Alc. This life should pay The forfeit to this hand!—remember, friend! I am devoted still, if sad reverse Demands the sacrifice! Phil. And why mistrust So much Alcides', mighty line yet place Such confidence in Athens? they, be sure Would still regard with no benignant eye Revolted slaves, that might revolt again Slaves, long devoted to their See note, page 118. Dorian foes By blood, and inclination. Virtue still To Alc. Survives in Sparta, while thy saviour lives Else, how dost thou survive? The dark attempt Against thy life, was but a private wrong Unsanction'd by the state. To milder thoughts, Misfortunes and the numerous ills that wait On life, have tam'd them. Let us, then confirm Their faltering steps in virtue! lead them on Like the paternal eagle who divides The fleeting air before her callow young And bids them ride the clouds! Thus we shall gain The proud ascendant in the lists of fame; And after times, with long applause shall tell How the Laconians, in the lists of blood Distinguish'd long above a warring world Rais'd their proud heads, while in her sanguine car Bellona led them on, and chanted loud The song of desolation. But their slaves Taught them a nobler lesson, open'd wide A brighter track to glory, bade them cast Those ruffian virtues to the midnight wolves And learn humanity. Arist. It is a perilous venture—if we fail Ruin attends on both! Alc. And be our fall Illustrious, rather by a noble daring (Tho' unsuccessful) for the The Spartans and Helots (or Messenians) were both of the Dorian Tribe, as the Athenians were of the Ionian race. Dorian name Than here to live for ever stigmatiz'd As traitors, as deserters to the cause Of our old enemies of Ion's race Union abhorr'd! but, if we still remain True to this fostering soil, that fed us long Our native walks, true to ourselves, our fame We must defend, (even with our dearest blood) This remnant of the great Herculean name A suppliant now for succour! Shall we stand Insensate, while a new Deucalion's flood For ever whelms the better light of Greece? Forbid it, Honour! and forbid it, Fame! Forbid it Thou! whose heavenly guidance here Planted the Spartan, and Messenian race Fraternal branches, in those happy fields Till discord rose between them! Amph. Shall we then Fawn, like the beaten spaniel, on the hand Rais'd for correction? Say, would this become The race of Hercules? He suffer'd woes 'Tis true, but woes inflicted by the gods He did not labour for the cruel king That slew his children! Mention not the gods— The gods have planted vengeance in our hands Arm'd us with their consuming bolts, and we Shall we, like children, fly with terrour back From the celestial shaft, as if we fear'd To wield heaven's enginry, and boldly hurl Her vengeance on their heads? 'Tis vengeance; vengeance! That sets the man above the grazing herd And show his native energy of soul! For what was memory given, but to record Our wrong? or reason, but to guard against Such wrongs in future? What, the powers of fancy. But, in their proper colours to display them? Alc. A noble sentiment! but here misplac'd It shows the man, I show the greater means That bids him rank with gods. Forgiveness, friend, That marks true magnanimity of soul Above the lion, and the lynx; for they Have spirits for revenge; and, rankling deep Wrongs in the glowing fancy oft survive For many a sullen year, but we are men! Let us a nobler vengeance seize! a deed To tinge their haughty fronts with honest shame! Let us subdue their souls, more glorious far Than mere subjection of the shackled limbs Now may we to such heights of virtue rise To such an awful pitch, as Sparta's sons Shall never dare to wrong their benefactors And deem it equal sacrilege to strike At us, as if they meant to wound the gods! 3 Helot. I doubt their faith—and yet I still confide In Athens for her aid, if Sparta dare Her insults to renew! Amph. How, Athens aid us! When we renounce her league! futile and false! Arist. Cease—for behold the delegate of heaven Apollo's priest himself in suppliant garb, Comes, with the ensigns of his god—revere The holy man! ye Helots!—with respect Receive him. Enter the PRIEST of APOLLO—the HELOTS make obeisance. Priest. Be these the signs of your obedient souls To the great name of the far-darting god That god, who clad in humble weeds, like you Erst kept Admetus flock, a simple swain; Who toil'd beneath Laomedon, to build The walls of Troy, and met a foul return, Who knew th'indignity and scorn of men. Tho' rob'd in flame, he walks the ætherial road! Yet he, that felt such wrongs, and feels them still By me requires you to relent and save The state of Sparta—Great Alcides sues To guard the reliques of his race, else all Must, with the sons of old Laconia, perish— For what are you, and that Crissæan band (Should Lacedæmon sink in night) to keep The Dorian name alive? When yonder god (Whose glorious presence o'er your eastern hills Awoke the woodland choiristers); at eve Beyond the broad Ionian dips his wheels. Say, can a little twinkling lamp of heaven A pensionary planet, on the verge Of day, with dim and ineffectual fire Repell the slow-wing'd dragons of the night That drag her curtain'd car? even such were ye When Sparta sets in blood, to rise no more!— Oh! then, obedient to the will of heaven Unite your fate to hers! I see your strength Assembled here. O let it be to aid us! Arist. Chosen from our tribes, two thousand valiant youths Not inexpert in martial exercise But wait the word to arm: their delegates Shall answer for themselves! Phil. May yonder gods Forbid, that Dorians, tho' opprest with wrongs Should part from Dorians, and with impious hand Destroy themselves and us! Amph. Flamen! before We answer, name your terms! Priest. Your leader has them And that they shall be granted, be yon god The witness! Ye shall this instant be enroll'd among The martial, free-born sons of Sparta's state Vested with every privilege that lifts The slave to match his lord! The man that claims His rank in battle, from that hour is free, A slave no more! the rest is outward form But needful, with lustration pure to purge The servile stain away! Phil. Then, what remains But, give us arms, and try if we can wield A Dorian lance? Priest. In yon deep vale below Where, 'mongst embowring woods, with unseen lapse Eurotas echoes thro' th'opposing rocks And fills with reverential awe profound The musing votarist, in the rustic fane Of him Pan., (who deals involuntary fears Along the nerves, and sees the demon band Of griesly terrours dancing to his pipe In soul-astounding gambola), pil'd there lies A magazine of arms, to mighty Pan— From Argos won when erst our arms repell'd The Thyrean's wild invasion. There you'll find Selected, holy hands, to deal around The dazzling spoils among your willing bands And send you glittering thro' your native woods Startling your Dryads with the glorious change They scarce will know their shepherds! Phil. But, behold! What stranger's that, who comes with looks of haste And draws our chief aside? Amph. Whate'er it be Our common danger, and our common claims Forbid all secrecy—divulge your message To all, or none! Arist. Stranger! my private ear Hears no proposal to my friends unknown! Their cause and mine are one, the crisis now All secrecy forbids, and even excludes Deliberation! on the common voice Of those brave youths, for instant action leagu'd Our fame, our fortune, and our all depends! Mess. Is there no man, whose sovereign voice compells The multitude? and must I hazard all In giving breath to that which brings along (When known) the fate of nations? 2 Helot. To that youth [Pointing to Alcander. Apply! his influence o'er our sylvan tribes Is uncontroll'd! whatever he decides Messenia follows. [Messenger whispers Alcander. Alc. Never! Helot! never! What! must we court perdition! fling away Our scheme of reconcilement, like a toy Of little value, to preserve a band By folly led to ruin? Mess. Led by you! Led by your promise! since I must divulge Your shame, before your Helots!—lur'd by leagues And oaths, now violated, we forsook Our homes, to fight your battles! now we stand Perhaps on ruin's verge, for you, unless You instant thro' yon forest force your way And mount the steep (where, in the yawning pass Laconia's sons oppose us) and hurl down Perdition on their heads? Ye need no weapons But those loose rocks, that, with tremendous frown Threaten the vale! Alc. We must not risque for them Our dawning hopes—they fail'd us in our need! Amph. Will you forget your leagues? ye Helots! say! Speak for yourselves! Priest. Aside. All, all, I fear, is lost. Event accurst! Alc. The Helots may decide!— For me—my doom's determin'd! If they join The band of Helice, my fate is fixt!— I will not live to see my best friend's life Given, a devoted sacrifice for me!— Messenia has her victim too, to buy Prosperity for blood! Helots. No—never—never. Thou shalt not die for us. We go—where'er You point the way. Mess. And dare you baffle thus Your friends? Ungrateful men! No single victim Atones for this! If Lacedæmon fall Athens and we with terrible revenge Will sweep your confines. Now, even now, perhaps, The dread chastisement of a broken league, In yonder clouds awaits you. Mark your doom! [Exit Amph. Aside. Then, ye devoted men! to ruin go! It is not mine to check you! Why should I Draw premature destruction on myself. Vain ruin! Fate is now in full career, For yonder, see! where Demaratus comes; What mean his wild looks, and his breathless signs? To them a HELOT. Ye are betray'd! Around yon woods I saw The banded Spartans march in complete steel; Even now they line the grove! Arist. Send, and observe! Now, surely now, at this important crisis, They would not venture to infringe their faith, And on themselves accumulate the plagues To treason due! [Helots in confusion. Priest. Stay a single moment Till rumour yields to truth! 2 Hel. Lead to the fane, The Argive trophies there will arm our hands, Or to repel the persidy of friends, Or front the public foe! Priest. Stay but a moment! Amph. What counsel's this? Thou canst not surely mean They should be found defenceless, when the hour May prove their last! Priest. Say, Helot, am I here Your hostage? Is my life within your power, And dare I utter falsehood? I that own The power of him whose piercing eye pervades The secrets of the darkest soul? Yet wait.— —A moment may determine. Enter a SPARTAN. Phil. Oh, in haste, Ye Helots! fly to arms! the foes advance, We spy their dust afar! Yon little remnant of despairing Spartans Take their last farewell of the golden day, Last of the Dorian name, if ye refuse To join their band! Phil. That is the train, whose march Inspir'd the panic terror. Alc. to the Helots. Join the foe! And they will thank you; but will never trust Revolting slaves! That proud and popular state, So free at home, with servile bonds abroad, Her partizans repays. Helots. Lead on! Lead on! We go where'er you call! We are not savages, But men! [Amph. and some Helots consult apart. Arist. To you, Philemon and Alcander, The conduct of our tribes are given! To you The great deposit of the Helots' doom.— Go! see them arm'd, and lead them to the field, Whence the tyrannic hand of time detains The most unfit for combat. Here I'll stay, And pray for your success! [March to music—Some stay behind. How now, Amphidamas, Say what delays your march? Amph. I want not arms From Pan! No causeless terrors are my dread! Tho' here I mean to stay. My friends suspect The presents of an enemy. The foe, Perhaps, is there already. Arist. Oh! thou dastard, When they return, besure thou shalt abide A dreadful censure. Amph. Better from my friends Than foes. For, what could be my hopes if there I join'd our lords, but jealousy or hate, (For well they know I hate them) or a post Perhaps, of certain death? But, if I stay, And—if my fears be true—a remnant still Is left to keep Messenia's name alive! If I have wrong'd our masters, this grey head Alone shall pay the forfeit! Heaven forefend The ills I augur! Be thou witness, Heaven! Whatever woes invade our rising state, They are not mine to answer. Wait th'event. [Exeunt severally. End of the Fourth Act. ACT V.

But behold When the young Asian comes, with changed dress More flowing and majestic! Like the queen Of night he seems, sailing in spotless veil between the parting clouds! A prophet's wreath Adorns his brow. He looks not of this earth Yet seems his ecstacy disturb'd and wild! His fine eyes roll, as if vacuity Contain'd some horrid vision. Here he comes! Enter ASPASIA. All hail! selected band! no longer doom'd To curse the glories of the rising sun Whose flaming car to others life and joy Dispens'd, but still returns of woe to you! No more pale Cynthia you accuse, that led The midnight ruffian o'er the tainted dew While, stead of silence and the balm of peace With sweet oblivion of low-thoughted care O'er the devoted roof, with haggard eye Sate speechless Horrour. You no more shall dread The keen nocturnal steel, or noon day scourge! Ye are dismist to ever during fame! Arist. Whence this wild strain—the Asian seems possest! Asp. Sound, Clarions, sound! Let images of war Possess your souls! for see! beyond your hopes The god of bloody trophies leads you on! —But soon the conflict ends—too soon it ends— Yet, tho' tranquillity along your fields Flits, like a dove, on solitary wing Tho' envy's self forbid, your name shall live To after ages, while Eurotas flows In triumph to the main! Arist. This had been well After some victory, but now it seems A pitch of exultation, premature As strange! Asp. Nay it is strange, and passing strange To see the humble swain forsake the shore And, like th'amphibious scaly brood, that swim The broad Nile, take the flood!—our wars at land Are ended—see!—we triumph on the main! Even on the proud Palladian element!— Our Helots!—mark them, how they brave the foe And dye the waves with blood—Eurotas wonders At his unusual freight! the water-nymphs Welcome their bridegrooms from the shore. The Dryads Astonish'd stand upon the woody verge In wondering pause! Arist. And I in awful pause No less, to hear thee like the Pythian maid!— O sport no longer with our hopes and fears! Asp. I see the chambers of the deep disclose And all the blue-hair'd deities advance To meet their new compeers! O hoary Neptune! For whom ascends that pearly-studded car With many a gem from Ormus, and from Ind! Who guides the reins? It seems Alcander's self Purg'd from mortality, august and large, Like young Palemon, rising from the wave! And see our Helots all with coral crowns Sport thro' the wat'ry element! Arion To his sea-harp attunes, in deathless strains Their triumphs! old Eurotas wafts them down To the wide world of waters, See! they sail Thro' the applauding isles; but why, oh why Forbid them on our shores to lift the spear And try their fortune on the stable soil? They might have triumph'd on the land—let Tyre And Carthage brave the flood! Let them explore the treasures of the deep But let us combat on the dusty plain It best befits the Dorian name—full soon Their old Athenian friends at Pylos moor'd Will view the floating triumph, and admire The new alliance of the Dorian name! Arist. Go some, and learn, what tidings! I am fixt And every pulse is check'd by cold dismay! [Exit Helots. Asp. The blue main tells it to the wond'ring stars In tempest tells it to the hostile fleet By Malea moor'd! I see another fleet Waiting to waft you o'er an unknown wave Where delegated hands the wreaths prepare Soon to adorn your brows! but other palms Must first be worn!—The sacrifice begins The offerings due to Neptune are prepar'd— Stern god of arms! why that unwonted mask That hides thy martial terrours? Why prefer That holy vizor to thy genuine frown? Why moves thy car so slow? Thy proud steeds champ And struggle with the rein! but, why conceal The ruffian's blade beneath the saintly pall? Thou bloody hypocrite! that holy leer But ill becomes the leader of debate And master of misrule! Arist. What dost thou mean? Thou seem'st to labour with some horrid theme Too big for utterance! Asp. May it ne'er be known! Conceal it night! in everlasting gloom!— Soon shall the raven's note your ears profane! One, to whose voice my soul suspending strains Are music! 2 Helot. Yonder, see! the tidings come. To them—Enter third HELOT. Arist. But this is one whose chearful looks declare How empty are thy visions—tell at once Have our Messenians reach'd the rustic fane And met a kind reception from the lords? 3 Helot. As kind as heart could wish—I saw them march I saw them pass in pairs between the ranks Of Spartan warriors! Arist. Ha! that looks not well! 3 Helot. Withhold thy dark surmises—Sparta's faith Is pure—the power of solemn bonds protects Our friends! I saw them from the postern gate Glancing in radiant files along the grove Now half eclips'd, now glittering on the day Like these long dormant tribes they seem, that sleep The winter o'er in low, degraded forms Till having past the mystic change, they wake At summer's breezy call, and wing the winds In gay embroidery, purple, gems, and gold, Exulting in the warm, paternal ray.— To soothe the new recruits, the rural pipe That call'd them oft to toil, at blush of morn Warbles respondent to the shrill ton'd fife That fires our martial bands. Asp. Soft is thy pipe O Pan! Its gentle breathings, heard afar Inviting to the fold the peaceful flock, Seems to console our sorrows!—but no strain Of clangorous trump, that wakes the battle's rage! Is half so dreadful! Oh! resign that pipe— Its music leads the poor misguided flock To the dark precipice.—Ye cruel swains! Say, is it thus ye wash your harmless flocks And send them, with their costly spoils at once At random, down the stream? their costly spoils Had blest you many a year! Arist. No more—no more Hence with thy prophecies, thy noon-day dreams Ill-boding Maniac! Asp. If it be a dream Yon walls, yon waters, yonder conscious grove Can witness! Arist. Thou, be sure, shalt feel the wrath Of Sparta. Asp. Could I singly fall! my doom Were welcome! But alas! by gloomy Styx I meet the grim accusing band, whose fate (Due partly to my influence,) hurl me down Among the doubly damn'd! Arist. Immortal powers! Is he distracted or inspir'd? my blood Runs cold to hear him! Asp. No—ye Helots! no! My inspiration's gone.—'Tis now despair, Shame, horrour, and repentance that awoke Those wailings—Fly,—Oh fly—and save at least A remnant of Messenia. Arist. Where's the danger? Asp. Could my confession but atone my crime Or stop the raging sword, already stain'd In Ithome's best blood! I could enlarge Upon my deeds, dilate the dreadful tale Till ye would start with horrour—but escape!— Fly! that alone is left you! Arist. Why escape? Suppose the peril certain,—must we call The murtherers to pursue us? We, alas! The refuse of our tribes, are hardly worth Extermination, our imperious lords Must still have slaves, in cruelty to train Their savage brood! Asp. To thee, unhappy sire! Yet flight were safety! tho' the vulgar tribe Were overlook'd, or spar'd to till the ground They water'd with their blood, Alcander's sire Yet could not hope to 'scape! Arist. Alcander's sire! What of himself? already lost and found In one revolving sun? Say, what of him If he be seiz'd, or fallen, I would not bear The load of life for kingdoms! Asp. Rest you still In your suspence!—I cannot bear to tell What heaven reveals! On thee alas! and all That share the blood of Aristomenes. The sentence is pronounc'd! I would not bear The pressure of my guilt a moment more But that the fell exterminating sword Already red with murther, will dispense To me, a stroke of justice! Arist. What's thy guilt? Asp. Too great to bear! Beneath the holy mask Of inspiration, with unhallow'd voice I dar'd to mock the mysteries of heaven And utter lying oracles! but that Had led to independence, freedom, fame. Had that been all! but, with insidious arts I scatter'd discord, sow'd dissension's bane Among your leaders, for low, selfish ends Too tedious to recount—my hatred sprung From rival love, (for I bely'd my sex,) I lov'd the Attic youth, he hated, spurn'd me He scorn'd me for Semanthe.—In revenge Philemon's mind with jealous rage I fir'd To thwart his measures! I with artful wiles Allur'd Semanthe from her native woods.— This was the fair pretext; that, she remov'd The rivals would support the general cause And emulation cease. My arts inspir'd New rancour 'twixt the rivals. Soon the flame Of discord blaz'd around. If you desire Atonement in my blood (tho' poor revenge For what you soon must suffer) take my blood! 'Tis yours!— 2 Helot. Thy tale, I fear, is true, for Dymas comes! What horrid vision has disturb'd his brain And bristled up his locks? Enter DYMAS. Dym. Helots! away! Treason and murther lurk within those groves! Arist. What murther, say! what signs? 2 Helot. Eurotas runs With blood! Arist Perhaps, the blood of slaughter'd steers Or immolated flocks! why thus disturb Our yet precarious peace with causeless fears? 3 Helot. Saw'st thou the bodies of these murther'd men? Or thou, or I must dream! the radiant files I saw parading thro' yon plausive groves Were gaudy visions of unreal bands, The day-dreams of a boy, who in the clouds Figures unreal armies! 4 Helot. Be thy sight However clear, the Spartan fraud might post This moving pomp, this spectacle of war Behind the fane, to favour the deceit To personate those bands, whose bodies now Perhaps are floating down the plaintive stream! To them—Enter Fifth HELOT. 5 Helot. They come! they come! O fathers! haste and see The triumphs of your sons! Oh blasting view I saw them rolling down the sanguine flood! Arist. Saw whom? 5 Helot. The victims of your impious foes! Oh Alcibiades! had we believ'd Thy words, we had not thus ignobly stood To see the slaughter'd victims borne along Nor one is found to drag the freight to land.— —Alas! behold the wretched father falls Bear him away. [Aristodemus borne out. Amph. Yonder the brother comes Of fallen Androcles, to pronounce our doom! To them—PHÆBIDAS. Phæb. No—to pronounce his own—behold the man Who led your friends to slaughter! if my blood Content you, bid it flow—for I must fall By your hands or my own! I bear a life Long, long devoted to th'infernal gods For cruel Sparta's weal—for Sparta's weal Unknowingly, I led your guiltless friends To ruin—The warm confidence I felt In Sparta's faith, I bade Alcander feel!— For his reliance on my vain surmise My fruitless hopes, already has he paid With life, and all his basely-murther'd friends Atone our follies or our faults with blood! Alas! to save my self-devoted life Alcander fell, in vain, lamented youth You fell—my blood must flow! Amph. Philemon too! Phæb. Philemon, all! Amph. Yet say, unhappy man How did your counsels sway Alcander's mind? Phæb. Ah ye curst Ephori! your dark designs (While in the smooth and smiling surface still We plac'd our trust) with deep destruction flow'd With seeming clemency they lur'd you on Relax'd their laws, to draw a larger prey Within the meshes of their bloody toils! —When seeming ruin over Sparta hung My country's love impell'd me to devote Myself a victim to the angry gods. If so, perhaps, I might have sooth'd their rage And make them force the Helots from their league With our stern foes! Alcander, in my charge And freed from bonds by me, with grateful heart Resolv'd to use his influence with his friends To save our state, to break the menac'd league To save his friend, or perish by his side. —Behold the consequence!— Amph Thy boldness thus To rush among thy foes, and tell our fate So dreadful to thyself; at least approves Thy truth—but let the gods, and Athens find The guilty in their wrath—for thee to bleed Were useless now.— Phæb. O never, never more Was such a victim wanted! deeper guilt In Sparta for a new atonement calls And I embrace my doom with joy! For Sparta If thro' all hearts the universal taint Of Persidy and Vice had spread abroad Their gangrene? not by all the breathing fumes Of Saba, nor by immolated hosts Were heaven's acceptance gain'd.—But I have laid A train to bring the guilty to their doom Those perjur'd Ephori, whose curst advice Caus'd this foul treason to humanity And poison'd half our troops! To Sparta's king And his untainted bands: (who still uphold My country's name;) a trusty friend dispatch'd Shall tell the traitors names, disclose their guilt And shew the proofs. Their office soon expires And to the people's dread tribunal call'd They too shall expiate this disastrous day. Amph. Live to avenge us! Phæb. Your revenge is sure Whether I live or dye! Amph. Oh yet proclaim In justice to mankind, the dreadful steps Which led us to our fate. Phæb. I know not all— Me they suspected, and dispatch'd me thence To save the bands of Helice—my fears And doubts were waken'd by the troops delay Meant to support my onset. I began To dread, that Athens with Messenia join'd Had stop'd the march of my auxiliar bands; Then, leaving to my second in command My post, I hurried homeward to prevent The spreading ruin, and to close the breach With my devoted life. Ah how unlike Those imag'd terrours was the direful truth I found at home! 'Twas one vast solitude Dreary and silent, from the city's bounds To fair Amyclæ! Rumour's self had lost Her voice, or faintly told a dubious tale That all Laconia's military bands Were must'ring by Eurotas—then the truth— The dreadful truth came flashing on my mind At once.—I hasted—but arrived too late.— Where o'er the dark flood hangs the rustic fane A shelving passage, arch'd beneath the walls Admits the murmurs of the passing stream Where, dark and gulphy, under bow'ring shades It rolls in gloomy whirlpools,—clos'd within A troop of bold assassins took their stand; Another cohort lin'd the sacred gate; And, as by pairs the Helots came, assign'd The victims to their fellows, far within Who gave the deadly stroke, and hurl'd them down To welter in the waves.—Meantime, without A band of seeming Helots, all in arms March'd from the postern, in long siles, and lin'd The parting shades, or mixt in sportive war; Those, to the candidates for arms, abroad, Seem'd their exulting fellows, clad in steel And prompt for action, All around was heard The trump, the timbrel, and the martial sife In warlike symphony to drown the groans Of slaughter—while abroad, in cheerful din According clamours, pealing to the stars The baffled ear beguil'd. The sylvan screen Flinging her canopy athwart the flood Deceiv'd the sight, and hid the frequent fall Of many a corse thick-plunging in the wave; From an exulting Spartan this I learn'd Who triumph'd in the tale. 2 Helot. Are all—all—slaughter'd? can we snatch from fate No remnant of our bands? To arms! to arms Ye Helots who survive! let us revenge Or join our slaughter'd brethren! Phæb. All in vain! Are these becoming ardours! deep around The grove is lin'd by a determin'd band Who menace ruin on the coming foe With level'd spears,—Ye hasten to your doom For ye may live to soothe your ceaseless toil With bitter tears, and mourn the hateful boon Of life, more wretched than your fellows fall! Their fall was glorious.—To the dreaded flame Of liberty, that in their bosom burn'd Victims they fell untimely! Ye may live For Sparta's cruel policy requires A nursery of patient slaves, to till With doubled labour, their detested soil.— For me, I wish'd to fall in glorious fight And tinge the point of some Athenian spear With my devoted gore!—That is deny'd —Yet have I hope that Sparta may revenge My fall, and bring these monsters of the state To bloody justice.—Honour yet survives In some distinguish'd breasts, by freedom warm'd; The gale of public spirit yet will rise And sweep away the thick-ensanguin'd cloud Which hides us from the skies.—Oh! Sparta—yes— Thou yet art worth atonement, else this stroke Were vain, and impious folly to the gods! [Stabs himself. Oh my Alcander! if we meet again Thine awful council of departed heroes Will grant admission to my gory shade!— Our cause was one, a glorious, public cause We fell to save our country! [Dies. Amph. And with him Messenia fell at once! her long career Is closed at length by Fate's relentless hand! There lies the man who could have sav'd our tribes From insult and from ruin, had his power Been equal to his mild humanity.— Let us forget our upright form—our name Of men! let memory die! let hope expire! Nor hope have we, nor claim, nor country now! But—if we had, Alcander's hapless fall And poor Philemon's might afford a theme To lesson future ages! One, misled By private friendship, sold that public faith That awful duty, which he owed his people To syren sympathy.—Philemon, sir'd To rage, because a woman frown'd, forgot He was a man, and basely flung away In a mad fit of jealousy, the means Of endless glory. Had they nobly stood True to the dictates of their reason, firm Against th'assaults of passion. They had led Those bands to freedom, whom in death they led Down the lamenting stream, whose Naiads mourn The man, whom every muse perhaps had crown'd With endless glory to succeeding times.— But now the work is o'er—the bloody band All reeking from the horrid task return! [Martial music heard at a distance. I hear the deadly fife's triumphant tones!— May all the furies speed them on their way And hell resound their dirge, whene'er they fall.— They must not find us here—hence let us haste Where no fell despot checks our falling tears. [Exit Omnes. FINIS. INTRODUCTION, TO THE TWO FOLLOWING DRAMATIC POEMS. The dissipation of the day is gone, With all her trivial scenes, her trivial sounds Discordant, various, as the themes that fill Her ear, still open to the novelties Of every moment! they are fled far west After Hyperion's gaudy wheels; the cares, The pleasures frivolous, and anxious toils As frivolous, awake in other lands And bustle in his beam, where yet his beam Dispenses light. They flourish in his smile And they have charms for others, who delight To turmoil in the varied chace, for me I better love, at the still, midnight hour Amid the pause of nature and of life To hear the solemn pipe of him, who rules The rude winds, call his levies to the war Nocturnal! Better far I like to hear The cataract of Clodio A River near Tullamore. where it fills The concert of the gales in cadence deep, Æolian harmony! or seems to pause Respondent to their pause! they lift the mind Like the full organ from the minstrelsie Of idleness and youth to graver themes! Ye Alluding to some subjects of juvenile Poems, by the Author. lovers' hopes, farewell: ye pictur'd scenes Of jealousy farewell! ye sanguine fields Ye flows and ebbs of states in former times Farewell! I sing the flow and ebb of souls! I sing Presumption, dashing on the rocks Of that eternal barrier (fixt by heaven To guard from violence the bounds of right) And her gay fragments, scatter'd on the wave, I sing Despondence Alluding to some subjects of juvenile Poems, by the Author., in a baleful calm With compass broke, upon the stagnant flood With monsters teeming to her frighted eye Portentous births, beneath the muffled noon Of brazen skies!—Ye martial scenes, farewell In Siloams' brook I wash your stains away!— Charge not the muse with fiction, while she sings Of old judicial blindness, mental sleep Lethean, tho' the clamouring elements Nay The walls of Jericho. tho' the height of their proud masonry Down thund'ring with stupendous din, untouch'd) By dread Bellona's forceful strokes) proclaim'd Their sleep a sleep of death, nor deem his tale An insult to your reason, who, unwarn'd By heaven's dread interdict, by heaven, whose hand He saw in daily wonders, dar'd the deed Illicit, which the sons of Israel mourn'd In blood, thrice conquer'd by a feeble foe. The first First Drama. were victims to their proud contempt Of heavenly justice, to destruction brought By the dire sophistry of Vice matur'd; Self-adulation, self-abuse! the last Second Drama. By earthly love (a fatal passion) led Of heavenly mercy to despond, renounc'd His reason and his god. When now the cup Of blessing, sent by gracious heaven, almost Had reach'd his lips, his wild precipitance Dash'd the celestial boon away: is this A character, the coinage of the muse?— Would heaven it were! then would the foulest fiend That rides the night, and deepens all her glooms The deadliest incubus, no more infest Our isles! no more his visionary gall Would dash the bowl, his visionary dread Of want or infamy, or slighted love Or slighted pride would arm the hand no more Against the throbbing heart! O scorn of life!— Oft in the generous bosom hast thou fixt Thy unrelenting fangs! Despondence! Hail I know thee by thy fixt and beamless eye Thy hollow woe-worn cheek and stealthy pace! Yet, all unlovely as thou art Written at a time when suicide was very frequent. thou charm'st The hapless soul who quits her hold on heav'n And oft to lawless, oft to ruthless deeds Conduct'st him thro' the gloom! Ah! who can aid With counsel, that ungovernable man Whose moon-struck madness, on the friendly tower Quenches the flaming beacon, flings away His anchor, and presumes to ride the waves When all the tempests are abroad? like him Is he, who thinks to stem the storms of life Without religion's aid! and what deprives The wretched pilgrim of religious aid, And flings him to Despondence for a cure Of all his ills? Sad cure! what brings to birth That sullen fiend, who quaffs the balmy tide Of Hope, and pours in poison in its stead? It is another fiend, Presumption nam'd, Proud mother of a wayward child! 'Tis she Who (still more frantic than old Canaan's race, Who trusted in their rampires, and their stores, And in their copious springs perennial wealth, To bear them thro' the siege, tho' Israel storm'd Their walls, for slattery woke while conscience slept Presume upon a tenement of clay, The brittle strength of bones, the nervous net, (Curious, but flimsey as the Gossamer Against the breath of Heaven) the ceaseless dance Of youthful spirits, and the sanguine maze, Forgetful of the hand that rolls the tide, Thro' all her blue meanders, to the fount Of life, and still renews the still consum'd With plastic progress; yet forgetful they Of hourly admonition from without, And from within, pursue their revels on, Waste the bland stores of Nature in debauch, And when the means are spent, they go to sale, They sell their birthright oft, without a blush, They sell the birthright of their country, lost To shame! and by the venal vote procure Fresh plunder for the harpies of the mind, Which plague them into constant vigilance, Vivacious still, and craving!—Yet for less. Poor Belgia is baptiz'd with blood, and Gaul Her blasted vineyards mourns, and yet we sleep Secure, as Jericho, when Israel came And shook her walls! O sleep! ye Orient gales, Sleep on, nor bring the raging pest of Gaul Across the surge! O chain the fellest fiend Of all the fell, unbridled anarchy, Nor let her hither point her deadly rage, Tho' we deserve the visitant! we hear The fall of empire, louder than the fall Of Jericho! We see the dreadful march Of Magog Some northern Potentate, mentioned by Ezekiel and St. John, by the name of Magog, who is destined to contribute to the fall of that power, supposed to be the Ottoman Empire, by the Commentators on the Revelations, the Decline and Fall of the Papal and Mahommedon Powers are, by Mede, Newton, Hind, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the Apocalypse shewn to correspond in time., polar king, predicted long. We hear below the subterranean voice Of that stern delegate of God, who mines His way in central horror, from the sea Calabrian, to the broad Ionian surge, Perhaps, to measure conquering step by step With him who leads the northern legions on, And The earthquakes of Calabria, and Cirila di Castello, near Rome, in 1783, and 1787. match the music of his enginry With hideous noise, beneath the rooted hills. While, as the Hyperborean flag unfurls Over proud Rhodope, the crescent pale Of Othman fades, with more than wizard charms; And, as the mighty spirit of the deep Some northern Potentate, mentioned by Ezekiel and St. John, by the name of Magog, who is destined to contribute to the fall of that power, supposed to be the Ottoman Empire, by the Commentators on the Revelations, the Decline and Fall of the Papal and Mahommedon Powers are, by Mede, Newton, Hind, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the Apocalypse shewn to correspond in time.Repeats his giant warnings, Tyber shrinks, And hourly tells his terrors, lest he lose His being and his name, or exil'd thence, Be doom'd to wander by another shore!— Such are the warnings of the moment, ye That bear, attend—and ye that scorn, beware. THE TEMPLE OF VESTA, A DRAMATIC POEM. ARGUMENT. Rahab, a young Canaanitess, the daughter of Adriel, (who kept a house of reception for travellers Called in the East a Caravanserai.) had been instructed in the knowledge of the true religion: the Demons, who presided over the Temple of Jericho, alarmed at this incident, lay a plan for her destruction, by which they expect that she would either be exposed to persecution, or seduced to perfidy; for this purpose they set on foot the machinations described in the progress of the poem.

RAMIEL, ASMODIA, NERGAL, and other Spirits of the Earth, Air, Water and Fire. Rami. With luckiest policy, Demonian powers! In seeming resignation we have left Our old distinguished, throne where long the world Ador'd us, by the name of heroes old And stellar virtues; this confirms our sway Thro' all the limits of our old domain Under proud appellations new bestow'd By seeming sapient man: a general name On us our slaves impose, of nature, power (Never beginning, never doom'd to end) Of this great mundane mass, upholding all Itself upheld by nothing. Still the crowd ('Tis true) beneath our old heroic names Our deities adore; but wiser men Whose grey-hair'd prudence wield the state at will, Tho' they support our worship and pretend A reverence for our vulgar names, renown'd Among the people, yet, by reasoning pride Misled, but more by vice, have found a Power Irrational See Cudworth, Chap. I. prolific, which sustains The varying forms of this prodigious mass With eyeless bounty, undistinguished love To merit or demerit, good or ill. Hence are they freed from every anxious dread Of coming retribution, and indulge In lust and hard oppression, at their ease, As youth or age the varying gust inspires.— This bounteous mother here, with secret rites The nobles worship, rites to none disclos'd, But to th'initiate; Night shall soon behold Some youths of noblest name admitted here To share the knowledge of these mystic things The vulgar must not know. The herd, which tills The soil, and sweats beneath the noonday load (Hewn from the quarry, and with labour borne To lift yon bulwarks high against the foe) These slaves have lost their freedom and their worth, Bondmen alike in body and in mind, They bear no mark of their great origin Celestial, but the upright form, unless Some bitter tears, when bondage wrings their souls Forgotten soon, when in the sacred fane The festive noise of jocund minstrelsie Proclaims nocturnal orgies, when the powers Of music, love and wine patrol our groves. Then every tie of kindred, and of law Dissolve beneath the musky hand, unfelt Of midnight and her hell-born hags, who spy With horrid glee, such sights as blast the morn And check almost the sempiternal wheel Of mundane things. Thus tho' our names be lost Our old imperial names, among the great, Our Empire o'er the minds of these proud peers Under the favourite name of Nature, holds With links more durable than adamant, By the smooth sophistry of vice confirm'd.— But these invaders from the banks of Nile Must be provided for, therefore your aid Ye spirits of the mingling elements! Earth, air and water, and the rage of fire I claim, how best your subjects to confirm In their allegiance, by what charms to lift Their ductile minds above the slavish dread Of these fell rovers of the burning waste To whose strange minstrelsie the rivers dance In uncouth measures to the wond'ring clouds And seem to dash the moon! Ner. More need have we To keep the crowd from wild revolt, enflam'd By their oppression, and bent down, like beasts, Prone to their mother earth! Asm. The self same skill Will serve to manage both, if any skill Be needful, where themselves (if to themselves Resign'd) will still hold out, if not against The warriours steel, against the rigid law That combates with their vices. On our power We build too much, and with a fruitless care (Which this occasion calls not) labour on Still to deprave the self-deprav'd.—The powers Of habit who denies? It gives to vice Or virtue, as it chances each to aid A nerve of steel, insuperably strong! The mind, by heaven illumin'd, and confirm'd In virtuous habits, tho' the welkin frown Tho' friends forsake him, tho' yon elements Conspire against him, yet, elated high Above the small annoyance, wafts aside The pigmy war, with calm, unruffled brow And easy effort, like the shepherd swain Whose gentle slumbers by an evening cloud Of buzzing flies, is broke.—Nor less the soul Whom deeds of darkness keep in thraldom sure, Tho' nature, all alarm'd, with thund'ring peal Clamours at every port of sense, which gives An inlet to the mind, tho' clouds distil Ambrosial food, tho' Neptune's surge invades The rampires of the sky, and lifts their waves In proud defiance to the fighting winds Tho' Jordan's waters fly before the foot Of heaven's proud favourites to the parent spring In hoarse retreat, and send from hill to hill The solemn warning to the nations round To leave their crimes, the soul by habit fixt In vice, her whole attention draws within And lets the civil war of elements In all their wond'rous transmutations, rage Without, unheeded.—Hence the glimmering lamp Of conscience at the last goes out, unfed By this external nourishment, bereft By tyrant vice, of that immaculate oil Which reason breeds within—then leave the sons Of Canaan to themselves, while lust survives To rule the young, while selfishness and love Of gold, inveterate grown, by thirst of sway Enslaves the old, ye have no need to fear A partner in your reign. Ner. But then, at last What have we to expect, but to behold (All impotent to save), our vassals, made Public examples of cælestial wrath? Asm. Let them!—for such the strange variety Of human character, that, tho' a few May take the warning, and renounce their crimes A greater number still will brave the hand Uplifted to destroy, for, such was still The consequence, even when the sentenc'd walls Of Sodom flam'd, and such will ever be While man is man, the sport of every breeze The slave of habit, tho' his will be free To chuse or to refuse his weal or woe.— Meantime, tho' our great foe invades our bounds With partial inroade, and alarms our states Here on the frontier, yet our central hold Of darkness, still his utmost power defies.— Ner. Who, at the last result, will gain the palm, To what those various-fortun'd tribes of men Are yet reserv'd, who knows? Asm. And how are we Concern'd? our empire still survives and grows With still advancing bounds, except alone Those desart wanderers from the banks of Nile. Rami. And we must be provided to receive These wanderers from the Nile, altho' heaven's hand Fights for them, and our elemental walk On their account, is hem'd in narrower bounds— Yet we have room within the cavern'd world Below, to range at pleasure, to explore Her secret hoards, and thence, for our avail No despicable aid may be procur'd. Be it your province, Asmodai! to range The subterranean world, with your compeers And all the fragrant families that drink In those green vales, and winding borders long Or on the lofty hill's aerial brow The salutary lymph, quintessence pure Of health, which, mingling their ambrosial stores Bid the eye sparkle, and the spirits dance New brace the fine, corporeal chords, whose tone Respondent to the movements of the mind Chimes in glad unison, till all within And all without is harmony and health, High confidence, heroic energy Of mind and body. Hence collect with care The steaming soul of all the verdant tribes Salubrious, that adorn th'enamel'd sod, Or from the hill perfume the morning gale, With them, commingle, sever, and distill Each hidden virtue, each quintessence pure Chalybeate, or saline, gem or stone, With those exhal'd, sublim'd, or mixt with care Or single (as requir'd) be the pure breath Of morn impregnate, and this evening breeze That whispers thro' yon palms, and bend their boughs In gentle salutation; Thence the Peers Of Canaan, as they bend before the shrine Of the prime mother Vesta, nature's queen Will think these emanations pure ascend By her benignant order, to inspire Elated thought, that spurns the mundane stage And soaring, leaves behind the feeble dread Of chance or change, of conquest or of death!— Then shall they hymn the bounteous Power that gives The transitory boon of sensual joy, And short dominion, with a louder lay Of triumph o'er their wand'ring foes, who camp Among the rocks of Gilgal. Should the sons Of vagrant Israel send their proud demand With choice of conquest or submission, soon With high contempt the message will be hurl'd In proud defiance back. [Exeunt Asmodai and other Spirits. SCENE II. RAMIEL, NERGAL. Ner. So far thy matchless wisdom and thy care For the reception of our Hebrew foes Have well provided, Asmodai can forge The viewless chain, which draws the willing mind Already lur'd by vice, but say, what drug What mineral charm, or vegetable spell Can levy the wild passions to engage In black revolt, where reason, awful queen Reigns paramount, and pure religion guards Against surprize, an heavenly centinel That laughs a siege to scorn?—Thou know'st, the foe Has gain'd a party even within our walls A formidable party, tho' its power Be to a solitary breast confin'd But that, a match for legions! Rami. Far too high Thou ratest this hindrance, for thou mean'st none else But Adriel's daughter, by her sire betroth'd To Abdon! oft with mingled grief and rage I mourn'd my baffled arts, employ'd in vain On her,—confusion blast that ancient swain (If man he was) who her allegiance first From us withdrew! I saw him, when he came To Adriel's hospitable dome; with him The numerous caravans of Elam came Over the burning waste, secure of harm— Yet in his garb and dialect was found The genuine stamp of distant Ind; his cheek Bore the deep tincture of that fervid clime, His presence struck, with reverential awe Of something more than man;—within the bounds Hallowed by his approach, I durst not shew My visage tho' disguis'd; The virgin seem'd With filial duty, mixt with love, to hear His powerful documents, whate'er they were.— And since that time, tho' oft in heavenly form I try'd to touch her heart, and lure aside Her mind from heaven to her allegiance old, My charms were all in vain, my arts were lost,— Had that old pilgrim still attended near Unseen, with ceaseless vigilance, her heart Could scarce have been more hostile to the gods Of her forefathers! Ner. At this important crisis, why on her Employ your thoughts; a maid of humble name And humbler fortunes? does it aught import The fate of nations, whether she retract Her fealty to Israel's god or join Her country's foes? Rami. If old experience try'd In this dark scene (that long has mark'd the range Of human fates, and how the ruling hand Disposes things, as best to suit his scheme Of spreading o'er the world his hated sway) May be believ'd, she lives to blast our views.— Still as the wasteful plague, at his behest Walks forth to scourge his foes, a welcome beam Of bright encouragement to those who pay His laws their homage due, dispells the gloom Of penal darkness.—Witness Goshen's plains Sun-clad, while Nile with melancholy roar Explor'd his passage thro' the mourning lands Beneath a starless sky, and Sodom's gates Spontaneous opening to the good man's flight And closing on his foes with sullen sound, Reserv'd in durance till th'avenging flame Descending swept them thence.— Abraham. And Terah's son Tho' fugitive, and exil'd in the cause Of injur'd deity, yet largely blest With rural wealth. Of his posterity Joseph, the great support of Egypt's throne Who o'er his cruel brethren, pin'd with want The noblest triumph of the mind enjoy'd The triumph of benevelence and love From those examples, cull'd in ancient times This sad conclusion flows, that she perhaps Who baffles thus our wiles, and singly dares To boast allegiance to our mighty foe Among our fanes, is conjur'd up to prove A bright example of those high rewards And honours due to those illustrious names Who singularly good, dare stem the tide Of vice and folly;—those who dauntless stand Against the current of a giddy world— This merits pause. Ner. But is there time to pause? It calls for swift prevention, for this night As Hesper twinkled in the west, I spy'd Two strangers, in the garb of rural swains Approach the gate; their garments, dust-besprent And parched lips seem'd to tell what length of leagues Their feet had travers'd, yet they scarce have past The gate, (and if I guess aright) are come Spies from the Hebrew camp, in foreign mask Disguis'd! Rami. Oh! let them pass! forbid them not! —Thou know'st, at this unseasonable hour None pass the gate, unless the royal sign Obtain admittance—thou, in herald's guise Unbar the portal, and to Adriel's house Instant conduct them!—there the way-worn man From distant Nilus, with the merchant meets Who brings the bales of Asia cross the sands Of sunny Tadmor to the Menphian shore,— On Rahab there I mean my arts to try Of various enginry, to threat, to soothe— Hard, if a female heart can stand the siege Of such confederates!— Ner Why to Rahab's doors Conduct the strangers? is it meet to bring Such fuel to her proud rebellious flame Already blazing far beyond its bounds?— Rami. Leave the result to me, on this I build A scheme for all their ruins, or at least To bring this virgin, from the ambitious pitch Of pride and singularity, to find An humbler portion—and take thou good heed To guide the strangers hither,—haste away. [Exeunt severally. End of the First Act. ACT II. [Scene I.] Scene—An Hall in the House of Adriel. [The noise of music and dancing heard at a distance.ABDON —ALONE. It must be so!—these raging elements Resent the outrage of our crimes! the groans Of a whole people, prest beyond the pitch Of human sufferance by their haughty lords Have pierced the centre, and unhinged the powers That keep th'eternal harmony of things.— And now, in dreadful discord nature speaks Of her insulted rights, old Jordan's flood In fierce antipathy her azure head High raising o'er the wond'ring hills afar Declares, in solemn cadence, how she scorns To lave our sin-polluted borders more Her liquid pillars touch the clouds; the clouds O'er-canopie our foes triumphant march In gloomy grandeur, and along the shores Resounds the dreadful warning! what are we Who scorn it still! are we more dull of sense Than rocks and floods! It seems so—for, alas!— Still riot stains our streets, and loud misrule Still celebrates the festive hour!—How loud They wound the modest ear of night! this night (When to the youths, initiate in her rites Of secret horrour, Vesta opes her doors) Is often mark'd with outrage! heaven forefend That the fell demon of the dusk should lead Their footsteps hither!—This to guard, I stand Here a fixt centinel, and mark afar The din that thro' this dread nocturnal gloom Rises and falls by turns—but hark—our guests Have caught the frenzy! I must either join Those orgies, which my inmost soul detests Or hence retire, and mark the madding crew! [Retires. SCENE II. The guests enter, their heads crown'd with wreaths of flowers, they form a circle and sing the following Hymn, Zalmon and Achan, the two Hebrews, at a distance. HYMN to VESTA, or the EARTH. All hail! imperial queen! Parent of every blessing, hail! By the tendant, seasons drest In many a varied gorgeous vest, Shores and oceans interchang'd In majestic beauty rang'd The mains alternate ebb and flow Fields, with deep-enamel'd glow When April sheds the primrose pale O'er the reviving scene!— Spangled thick with many a star Thy blue pavilion lifts its ample roof And round thy realm, with constant care Thy guards, in flaming squadrons, march aloof! Night relieves the lord of day Then the moon begins her state With soft step issuing thro' yon Eastern gate And from th'Olympian steep Watches o'er thy sleep, Till morning sends the modest centinel away, With all her twinkling train Beyond the western main, Till sober evening calls their vigilance again; All, obedient to thy law, The predestin'd path pursue And with reverential awe Bring in turn, the tribute due First Orions finger frore Decks in dread thy martial form Sheds around his wintry store Height'ning every awful charm, With a crest of wreathed snow Gleaming ice thy gorgon shield Like some warlike power you show Issuing radiant to the field Next thy praise the pleiads sing While the vernal showers distil While the balmy-breathing spring Spreads her vest along the hill. Thy martial terrours now are laid aside And from the east thy fire-wing'd paramour Bright summer courts thee for his beauteous bride, And smiling wins thee to unlock thy store! He bribes thee with his Suns, a fervid train Emerging lovely from the lap of morn The bright-stold cavalcade thy favour gain And in long pomp thy cloudy courts adorn! Meanwhile the lightly sportive gale Wafts aside in wanton play In mid air thy floating veil Breded gold, and vapours gray. Soon the red, autumnal star Crowns the board, and fills the bowl While thy radiant guards afar, Sing thy praise from pole to pole, There they dance their endless round Vested all in golden light Where thy wide dominions bound Meets the verge of ancient night. Thou with anxious fears to come Ne'er will tinge the cup of joy, Nor with dread of future doom Our extatic dreams annoy! Hail! benignant empress! hail! Send us odours, send us wine Send the lilly of the vale Round our brows thy roses twine. [They all pour Libation in their order, one offers the cup to Zalmon, and next to Achan, who both refuse it. 1 Guest. And who are ye, ungrateful men! who dare Thus to renounce that loyalty ye owe To your benignant mother? do ye live Her pensioners, upon her bounty fed Each moment of your lives? does every pulse Bear witness to our Queens maternal love And can ye still presume to thwart her rites To check the hallowed harmony that reigns Thro' this vast city in full unison Of grateful adoration join'd? declare Your names and whence you came, that we may learn In what strange climate of the foodful earth Our patroness maintains the thankless race That spurn her bounty, and defy her power! Zal. We thank the hand that feeds us; nor deny Superior goodness and superior power, Nor are religious rites to us unknown, Nor are our bosoms so obdur'd by crimes As to forget to whom we owe ourselves, And what is ours, but to declare our names And country, we are yet forbid; our laws Forbid us also to adore the gods Of strangers! 1 Guest. And is Vesta's name unknown To any people, or to any clime Is not her bounty felt by all? Zal. And much By some abus'd! but we acknowledge one No weak dispenser of his gifts to all Promiscuous, undistinguish'd, as blind chance Or blinder bounty (without justice) bids. But one, who in the cause of virtue still And for her sole encouragement, bestows His various dispensations, if not here, At least, hereafter. 1 Guest. Came you here To taste our bounty, and insult our ears With fables of futurity, day-dreams Implying censure on our conduct? then 'Tis like ye are not what ye seem! perhaps Wanderers, or spies from yonder Hebrew camp Egyptian vagabonds, or Arab thieves— The state shall know you better, haste ye! come! Seize those profaners of our holy rites And bear them to the senate. Zal. Touch us not— Our lives are not the playthings of a crowd Zealots of a dumb idol, or a name They know not what! 2 Guest. Why stand ye thus aloof! Ach. Because a greater power than yet they know Restrains them! 1 Guest. That shall be determin'd soon To your confusion. [As they are going to seize them, four young Patricians come in (supposed of the party newly initiated in the secret rites of Vesta) all the guests disperse, except Zalmon and Achan. Zal. to Achan. How the dastards fly!— Great God! who bade their haughty tyrants shew Their formidable aspects here, to chace The trembling cowards hence! thy name we hail And blest in thy protection stand our ground! Enter ABDON. O what avail'd my vigilance, my care To keep the greedy hand of savage spoil And lordly rapine from these doors! O lost For ever lost! Oh Rahab! what shall guard Thy virgin sanctity from outrage now? I fear the fame of thy distinguish'd charms Has wander'd forth, and fir'd the lordly crew— O for an angel's hand to lead her hence! O for an angel's hand to touch their eyes With blindness! as the men of Sodom erst When Abram's kinsman with the virgin pair Trembling escap'd to Zoar! But be still My apprehension! lest I guide the search Even by my terrours to the panting prey Which I would wish conceal'd! Her father's friends, My friends I'll summon ere I lose her thus— Or they, or I shall fall! [Exit. 1 Pat. [Entering and looking around.] Here late we heard The voice of Revelry. Now all is hush'd, And still. The crowd is all dispers'd, but two, And who are they? They wear a foreign garb! To them. Say, strangers! where is all the crew who join'd So late in jovial clamour? hence the noise Seem'd to proceed, but interrupted soon By strains, unseemly on this festive night! Zal. We know not, we are strangers to your rites, As to the tenor of your questions. 2 Pat. Whence, And who are ye? Ach. It boots not to declare Our name or nation: in this public haunt Of strangers, and promiscuous guests, from climes And nations far remote, it were a task Irksome and endless to enquire their names! 2 Pat. Do ye presume to dally with your fate, By dark evasion, and to wear that look Of proud defiance too? Do ye not know That in our bosoms rests the dread award Of life and death? Zal. Your hand you cannot stretch But by permission of an higher power, And he, besure, will take a strict account Whene'er against the hospitable law Ye dare to lift it, or employ its force To violate the stranger. 1 Pat. Brother, come— This is some vender of dry proverbs; fed By wondering rustics with precarious meals For selling wisdom by penurious scraps, In pompous phrase, thro' cots and hamlets poor, And now, his overweening pride conducts This pedant to the capital, inspir'd With empty hope a better mart to find For his insipid ware. 3 Pat. Avaunt! 2 Pat. Begone! Go hunt for hearers in the sordid haunts Of rustic wonderment! we have in view A nobler game! [Exeunt Patricians. Zal. What mean the brain-sick boys, Is it with native insolence, or wine, Or the hot sallies of impetuous youth, Their pride is lifted up so high?— Ach. Whate'er The cause, they seem (all boastful as they are) Devoid of native courage: did you mark When you put on that lion-look, which marks The race of Judah. how the colour fled From the flush'd check, and Terror took her turn To dim the sparkling insolence, that flam'd In every glance? Zal. I did.—But all the guests, Methinks, are fled!—What must the treatment be That thus has crush'd the manly spirit down, (And spite of the angelic form) depress'd To the low level of the trodden worm That darts into the cover, when he sees The majesty of man approach! Those slaves Are hardly worth a conquest, and their blood Would but disgrace our swords, but that the will Of heaven ordains to hold the miscreants up, To after ages, an example dread Of what they may expect, who float along In the strong tide of tyranny and vice.— But hark—a noise within!—We soon shall learn The glorious cause, which brought those patriots forth, For what redress of wrongs, what splendid acts Of charity or valour they forsook, At this dark hour, the orgies of their gods! Rahab within. Help all ye pitying powers on high! Defend My weakness, or I'm lost! Oh Abdon, Abdon, Where at this sad, disastrous hour art thou? Oh father, father!—But why call in vain Father or friend, to rush on certain fate? 1 Pat. within. No, no—not here—another temple waits A victim so illustrious! Heavens!—what charms, [She is dragged out by two of the patricians. What dignity of scorn, what loveliness, O'er all her form! My struggling fair-one! come, It grieves us much, that to our lot it falls To seize you as a criminal of state, An open scorner of your country's gods! And you, at this late hour, must come before Th'assembled states, and answer to your charge. 3 Pat. Or if your virgin modesty refuse To grace the senate with your presence now, Our order is to lead you to a place Of safety, and attend you there till morn! Rah. O thou! who bad'st the Red Sea part before Thy chosen armies! grant a way for me To 'scape this shame, or send deliverance down, From those!— 4 Pat. Stop her audacious mouth! She speaks Nothing but blasphemy! [Zalmon and Achan appear. Zal. Thy prayers are heard, Forsaken maid! but not o'erlook'd by heaven! Ach. Heavens! what a form! and is it thus you treat The stamp of Heaven's own hand, when it appears Amongst you? 1 Pat. Who are you? Confusion—Here Again! Plebeians! go! and find your cells. What make you here at this dark hour? Avaunt, Hide your obscurities in kindred gloom, Or this right hand shall mix you with the dust From whence you sprung! Zal. Unhand your trembling prey And go in peace! proclaim your glorious deeds Your piety and justice in the fanes Of your great deities, with all their priests Around!—What! has amazement ty'd your tongues? 2 Pat. [Drawing a sword. It has not bound our hands, as ye shall find Audacious ruffians! Rah. Oh! in pity, heaven! Prevent a scene of bloodshed, or let me Be the first victim!— 3 Pat. Seeming modesty! Are these thy favour'd guards? but they full soon Their proud temerity shall mourn. [Zalmon and Achan each draw a concealed sword. Zal. Fall on! We are not us'd to tremble at the frown Of proud nobility! 2 Pat. Is it even so? [They engage: Zalmon and Achan beat them off. Zal. [To the Patricians going out.] Nay more—ye violators! learn from us (And think by us heaven thunders in your ears The dreadful warning) that your crimes are full And here your chastisement begins! [Ex. Patricians. Ach. Tongue-valiant heroes! is it thus your hands Maintain the mischief of your hearts? would heaven That vice would always vindicate her cause By such effeminate bravoes, silken sons Of Luxury and Sloth! They roam the street At the wild voice of Riot, and appall With empty threat, the reptile race who chance To crawl across their way, but shrink before The warrior's frown, and to their covert fly, Like timorous deer! Zal. But you, perhaps, have wrong'd Their valour, stand upon your guard—for here They come again! To Rah. Take courage! gentle maid, Thy guardian is the same with ours; that God In whom (with glad surprise) we find you trust. Rah. Nor trust in vain, for lo! benignant heaven Has deign'd us other aid. Oh Abdon! friend. Enter ABDON and CANAANITES. Behold and thank my saviours! sent by him Whose piercing look pervades the deepest gloom, And smites the ruffian's hand (uprais'd to strike) With nameless terrors! Abd. To that God be praise, God of the stranger and forlorn! To him My orisons shall ever rise, his laws My life shall still obey! Oh take my thanks, Accept my heart, my life, 'tis yours, 'tis his, Who nerv'd your arms to combat for a life So dear to me, and dearer far than life!— To Rahab. Her honour! In my dread for thee, I flew To rouse those faithful friends to the defence Of this asylum of my dearest hopes! I met the violators in their flight, But, oh! what signs of horror mark'd their looks, Distinguish'd thro' the gloom! They were not worth Revenge! we let them pass, to spread around The panic where they flew; I thence dispatch'd A faithful friend, to dog them at the heels, And give the signal, lest their coward fears Should yield at last to Reason's calmer sway, And urge them on to try their fate again With new confederates, and augmented rage. Lest this should happen, thou, my love! retire, And we, assisted by those generous friends, (But most by that benignant power who led Their blessed footsteps hither) shall protect Thy life and honour both! [Exit Rahab. Zal. But, who is he Who comes with such important looks of haste!— His eye speaks wonder; but we know not yet Whether his coming bodes alarm or joy. Enter ELIEZER. Abd. Ha—Eliezer—tell at once what cause Brings you so soon with such unusual looks Of terror and surprize? Are we to fly, Or is our flight restrain'd? Thou wast not wont To tremble with a woman's palsy thus, At every rumour! Eli. 'Tis no trivial cause, Nor fear, that sent me on such breathless haste. Let no unfounded terror slack your hands, There is no cause of dread! The panic cloud Which lately hover'd o'er this trembling roof, Invades your foes, and o'er the city spreads With the contagion of a pestilence, That walks the streets at noon, and sweeps along A people with their king! Abd. What wondrous cause Has sent this terror in a moment round? Eli. The young patricians, from those doors expell'd, And baffled in their foul attempt, by powers Above all mortal prowess (as they deem) Have found an ebb of insolence, and now Fanatic frenzy, in full tide, comes in— Her heady current sweeps away the bound Of vanquish'd reason. Even the senate reels ('Tis said) beneath her influence, inspir'd By those intrepid warriors; and the night Confounding, mingling, magnifying all, Dilates the deadly phantoms of the mind To giant size! Abd. Oh! righteous Heaven! your names (More potent than the dreadful syllables Which call'd the cloud-born pestilence) possess The force of armies, and unhinge the strength Of Canaan's noblest state! Say, who are ye, Angels or men? Zal. Whate'er we are, to you We promise safety, in the awful name Of him, who scatters armies, with a word, Potent as whirlwinds, (whose infuriate breath Levels the woods tall files,) if ye observe What we direct, and gather all your friends To this heaven-favour'd roof. Abd. I go—I fly. Haste, Eliezer, help me to collect The partners of our heart, and of our hope, Who long have groan'd beneath the lifted scourge Of our unfeeling lords! yes tyrants! yes I see, I feel—your doom, at last is near— The dreadful harvest of your crimes is ripe, It reaches to the clouds, its root in hell, Sown by the fiends! but soon the deadly scythe Of Desolation comes to lay you low In common ruin, yet I mourn your fall, And would prevent it if I could! [Exeunt Abdon and friends. ACHAN—ZALMON. Ach. Now, Zalmon! Why stand you thus in calm tranquillity, As if confiding in your strength, you held The dreadful bolt of heaven yourself?—but think One moment, think, upon what slippery ground We stand; our names, our phantoms rather spread Confusion's panic thro' the streets—afar We seem terrific shadows thro' the gloom Of double night, that for a moment lasts, (This mental darkness, with a starless sky In horrour blended,) but the springing dawn Of reason, (which a moment may produce) A single spark, by accident or chance Lightning the dusk, will shew us what we are Detected to the eye of sober sense, And to mere mortals dwindled down at last, We that now wear the garb of gods!—what then Remains, but by a secret embassy To rouse the slumb'ring host, and lead them on To take the 'vantage of the dreadful hour And scale the walls, or force the guardless gates Ere yet the tumult to a calm subsides And reason re-assumes her throne?— Zal. Shall I Or thou presume to mix, with daring hand The little views of human policy With heaven's tremendous counsels? art thou sure That these nocturnal stratagems and thefts Of war, will best fulfil the great designs Of Providence? Her judgments she displays Conspicuous in the presence of the sun Conspicuous, as her mercies!—martial slights And frauds, she deigns not to adopt, for man And man's short-sighted wisdom, are forbid Among the glories of th'Almighty's plan To mix its earthly, and unhallow'd dregs: The worldly warriour all advantage takes To sate his lust of fame, or lust of gold But we, Heaven's delegates, for nobler ends Brandish the consecrated steel.—For heaven, And to assert her violated laws: Not in vain brass or monumental stone To rank with demigods, we take the field!— Not with accumulated plunder gain'd From burning hamlets, and dismantled towns To purchase from the mercenary bard The pomp of adulation.—Nightly frauds!— Would they not seem as if omnipotence Wanted the aid of stratagem? would this Become the dreadful name, or tend to aid The glorious cause for which he clove the deep And walk'd the troubled ooze in flames! the cause Of virtue, of humanity, the cause Of moral excellence, each heavenly gift, That lifts us from the dust to tread the stars!— Leave the result to heaven! the cause is his And let the means be his! Ach. Yet you forget That in the fervour of mistaken zeal That errour, which in others you accuse Becomes your own adoption!— Zal. Friend! you speak In riddles—but explain. Ach. You justly blame That man's presumption, who aspires to mix His counsels with the deep, mysterious scheme Of him, whose will determines all below; Yet you yourself (nay hear me out my friend With patience!) tho' in piety and zeal For heaven, to none inferior, yet seduc'd Even by your boasted piety, presume Heaven's movements to constrain, to guide the hand Omnipotent, with dictatoiral voice Which seems to say, Those are your proper bounds; This line and this alone, thou shalt pursue; No star shall gaze on thy nocturnal march! Night still must slumber on her ebon throne And ne'er behold thy majesty, amaz'd.— Thy glories rising with the rising sun With him shall climb the sleep ascent of noon And dazzle his meridian beams—is this The genuine language of thy heart, or no? Would'st thou prescribe to heaven? wilt thou deny That this deep frenzy of the soul, that raves Around those battlements, whose voice even now We hear,—was sent by heaven, to chace away The shadow of resistance, and to call The slumb'ring host, with no unmeaning voice To seize the instant moment? shall we lose The crisis by your sloth, or causeless fear? Zal. Achan! you know, that heaven, not man—commands My reverence, and my dread, I fear the taint Of wrong, and that alone! Ach. I know your courage; I know thou feel'st the honourable dread Of leaving thy appointed post; but think What strictest duty claims, nay what our Chief Himself expects at this important hour! Say! ought he not to know this sudden change At this conjuncture, and in judgment sit Upon the sum of things himself? To him And not to us, the mighty privilege Belongs, of judging what is right and fit, Whether to take advantage of their fears And pour on his already frighted foes Treble confusion, or to wait the hour, When this dread hurricane subsides, and seize The smiling moment of fallacious calm With unexpected rage to strike the blow Like thunder, bursting from a cloudless sky— Consider this—lest your too rigid sense Of duty, turn to blame, when Joshua hears That golden opportunities were lost By our rash confidence, or coward fear— For so the world will construe our delay If we should linger here. Zal. But who shall go? Shall one, or both? Ach. Our sudden flight would cause New panics to the crowd, to find us now Confronting their patrician pride, and now Vanish'd they know not how, would make us thought Somewhat above humanity, and rouse Their fears to frenzy! Zal. But, to leave the maid In jeopardy! Ach. aside. Ha! is it so! my friend I fear'd as much!—[To Zalmon.] and is it here The zeal of Zalmon points? In Abdon's guard The maid, I think is safe!— Zal. And wouldst thou cast On me the foul suspicion, that my feet Are fetter'd by the myrtle bands of love? That low degenerate passions quench my zeal For Israel's glory! Tho' to go or stay Is in my option, and my will mine own Yet to convine you, and the world, how much Zalmon the imputation scorns, that love Should warp him from his duty, (love, by heaven Unsanctioned) where the voice of glory calls And Israel's cause, I go, and leave the field To thee! do thou my friend, respect thyself! And that ensures thy duty to thy God To Israel, and thy friend!—I leave to thee This lovely maid! revere her plighted vows, Protect her virtues, and regard her love! Think that her lover is our best ally And heaven will still protect thee, as before! I soon will come, before their fear subsides With a selected band to rescue thee. Exit. ACHAN —SOLUS. He too suspects my love! yet leaves me here In full possession of the lovely prize!— What does this mean? my utmost wish is given— And why this dread? the vital tide recoils In hurrying tumult to my labouring heart, As if I trode a precipice, and saw Destruction from below! my rivals now Are both departed, Abdon to select His friends, and Zalmon, in a few short hours Will shake these trembling and devoted walls With Israel's chosen legions in his train— Golden Occasion smiles and points the prize Already in my reach, if I but dare To stretch my vent'rous hand and seize the boon! But should my pleaded passion touch her heart And should her plighted faith dissolve away Before the fervour of my vows, will heaven Sanction the bold attempt? will heaven permit Alliance with a gentile?—Yes—our God Tho' just, is too indulgent to inspire This fever of the blood, that fires my brain, That burns in every nerve, and yet refuse The remedy within my grasp! to pine To languish thus, and not to try the means Of cure, were low despondence! but in vain I now deliberate—good and evil now And right and wrong, upon a moments point Revolve in giddy whirl, for Abdon soon Will come, and with him comes despair and death.— What noise is that? O lingering fool! behold! Confusion to my hopes! my rival comes. Already! Enter ABDON and CANAANITES. Abd. Can we hope, illustrious friend! Your pardon for our stay? but is thy friend Our noble guardian, summon'd hence away? Ach. He goes To rouse the bands of Israel; while your fears Render resistance vain, a few short hours Will see your boasted bulwarks hemm'd around By Heaven's own legions! Abd. Should they force our gates Say what ensues? Ach. The wasteful rage of fire And undistinguished slaughter! Abd. Can our doom Be yet delay'd or shunn'd—my country! oh! Ye palaces! ye heaven-aspiring towers Ye solemn temples, must ye fall? Ach. One way And only one remains, to save the name Of Jericho! Abd. Give it a name—I fly To try—if yet within th'extremest verge Of possibility, it lies. Ach. Their doom By prompt submission to Jehovah's laws Given without limit, may preserve your lives And walls. Abd. Alas! the haughty senate still Oppose the general wish, the giddy throng Of young patricians overbear the vote Of the pacific few; the priests, inspir'd With all the bitterness of holy zeal Oppose the popular tide; even those, who late Shrunk from your looks with terrour, and repell'd By you, began to propagate around Their panics, by the holy Flamen fir'd Resume their pride, deny their former fears And put on looks of manhood! Ach. Does it seem To them so easy, with the Syren art Of courtly sycophants, to turn and sway The multitude, whose fermentation seem'd Th'immediate act of heaven? Abd. Incens'd by wrongs They scorn their master's lore, and yet deride Their menaces and prayers, the lifted scourge And supple knee imploring!—Priestly arts And lordly threats alike have lost their power. Ach. What, have the masters of the state resolv'd Submission or defiance? Abd. They prepare To seize the citadel. Ach. What influence Is yours among the people? Abd. Till this crisis I never made th'experiment. 1 Can. His power And influence are great, tho' ne'er till now Even by himself suspected, such the force Of inborn merit, tho' in humble life! Ach. Does the proud senate know his power? 1 Can. They do, Or soon at last, shall know. Achan to Abdon. Dost thou affect Thy country? would'st thou heal her civil wounds, And ward the certain and tremendous blow That threatens from abroad? Go—point their danger, Address the Senate! ask them, if their walls Can stand before the power, whose lifted arm Sever'd the main sea for his people's march And gave their feet to press the unsunn'd sands! Go tell them how the rolling waves retir'd Pushed from their poise by the careering winds! Tell how old Ocean woke, and roll'd his robe His undulating robe of azure dye Round his gigantic limbs in haste, and fled To shun the dread invasion. How aghast His pale eye from the congregated clouds Look'd down upon the moving pomp below, Where o'er his pearly bed, thick trampling march'd The fugitives of Memphis. In their van No ensign wav'd, the pride of Tyrian looms With mimic blazonry, but high above Streaming long radiance o'er the thick-wore night Empyreal glory led them! Tell how loud The billowy pile, that seem'd to quench the stars Impending hideous ruin o'er their heads Threaten'd with ineffectual roar, withheld With strict aereal rein by him who rides The winds! describe, how unresolv'd, aghast They stood, till the august Viz. The light that preceded the Israelites. orb mov'd along Like the glad progress of the morn!—exalt With heaven's own energy thy pompous style To match the long majestic colonnade! How their pale fronts the watry mirrours smooth'd And as the lamp ethereal pass'd, return'd With interchangeable, broad glance, from each To each, the polish'd helms, the figur'd shields And horrent spears, thick-twinkling as they pac'd In measur'd march along. How Miriam's voice Led the respondent choirs, as thus they sung Deep charming the nocturnal march, “Ye sons “Of Seth! be not afraid!—yon frowning pile “Of waves, which longs its brother wave to meet “In loud fraternal ruin, threatens death— “But not to you!—below yon gloomy arch “Securely tread, as if the marble gates “Of Memphis, threw their solemn canopy “Over your heads, nor tremble when you hear “The thunder of Busirian cavalry “Careering thro' the deep.—Their way is dark, “Presumption leads them on, and she is blind! “Not so your holy guide? hark how they plunge “Darkling amidst the hostile brine! and now “The noise is heard no more, for ever lost “In that tremendous burst, and loud salute “Of kindred waves, long sever'd; now combin'd “That shake the regions round,” such was the scene My father told, who pass'd the wond'rous vale With Israel's squadrons, such were then the deeds That scatter'd terrour thro' the nations round And shook Arabia's hundred thrones, from Nile To Jordan! Go! and try its full effect On Jericho's proud King and Senate stern.— Bid them observe the thunder as it rolls Before the bolt descends!— Abd. To thee I leave And heaven, the guard of this beloved roof And my soul's treasure, the heaven-ransom'd maid For heaven, when thou art present, hems thee round With her own legions! [Exit Abdon. ACHAN —SOLOS. Go—and when those walls See thee again, may'st thou possess thy love! But I'll provide for thy security And teach thee such a lesson as shall lay Thy stormy passions, all thy hopes and fears Thy love and, all thy anxious cares to rest. If thou attend'st to the philosophy By thy new masters taught! I go to find The unsuspected means, and then, the fair (If Zalmon come not with his prouder claim To thwart my wishes) will reward my vows— If he delay, the grateful King bestows The blooming maid; as my discovery's price— Should Zalmon come, and conquer, yet perhaps The pious warriour's heart is free! and then— O, transport! O felicity! he brings The conquering troops of Judah, and for me Scales those imperious battlements and gives The treasure to my arms! It must be so— I soon will visit this proud fair, and try Whether (if Abdon were removed,) my suit Could touch her breast, for, while he lives, he reigns O'er her soft bosom in full sovereignty And Zalmon may arrive, the storm of war May thunder round our gates; her enginry May shake our turrets, ere a moment's given To shake her firm resolve!—dead silence reigns Thro' every room! the place is all my own— First, I'll secure the lover! then I'll try If I can fill his room. The time is fit to touch a virgin's heart When her nice scruples, and her virgin fears Are laid to rest, and softer thoughts begin To spread their downy plumage o'er the mind. Exit. End of the Second Act. ACT III. Scene First —A Street in Jericho. Officers leading two Criminals, (with their faces covered) to Execution, a crowd following.—A fire seen at a distance. 1 Offi. Now try your spells. ye magians of the Nile! Try your Egyptian charms! implore your Gods To loose your chains! evoke the water nymphs To waft their liquid treasures on the winds From Jordan's sacred flood, to quench yon flames! Forbid the rising zephyrs to disperse Your ashes thro' the sky, for they will hear That voice which wields these elements at will, Bid the firm centre yawn, and cast abroad Her baleful damp, to quench the rising blaze And deaden with cold touch the vital lamp In every bosom! ye are dumb, methinks!— The thunder of your eloquence is mute! The light'ning of your eyes, that sent around Pale terrour thro' the trembling state, is gone! Where are your factions now, that lin'd the streets And roar'd defiance to their gracious lords Your shouting crowd?—they follow you along In abject silence! they who seem'd to doubt The power of Vesta, they who scorn'd her laws, With vile ingratitude her gifts receiv'd Blaspheming the kind donor, learn at last The impotence of those fallacious Gods Who late (they hop'd) would loose their galling chains And sweep away the majesty of state Down the swoln tide of anarchy! 1 Can. Great Vesta! Are these the Hebrew spies? are these the men From whose terrific eye the warriour fled Amaz'd, and scatter'd thro' th'assembled state Their panic fears?—And is it thus at last The God of Israel vindicates his slaves? 1 Offi. Learn thou obedience to thy country Gods; Nor, tho' they seem to slumber, think their wrongs Forgot! for thee, for all th'offending crew Who lately seem'd to waver in their faith They only claim these victims, tho' no less Than them ye have deserv'd the penal fire! Go home! be thankful, and adore the power Who spares the guilty crowd, and gives them space For penitence,—lead on!—the rising flame Rebukes our stay! Amasa! let thy care Disperse the crowd. [Exit with the Captives and Guards. 2 Offi. Ye who expect to see Their God descend to quench the flaming pile And snatch his servants in a humid cloud Away,—attend the spectacle! your presence Will shew your want of faith in Vesta's power And by your doubts, the seniors of the state Will judge your loyalty, but ye, whose minds Submissive to the Gods, repose your faith On what ye have already seen, the bonds And sentence of those formidable men Disperse, and bless the Gods at home. [Exit Canaanites—one remains with the Officer. 2 Can. By thee Amasa! let me not be rashly deem'd Too idly curious, if I long to know How the strange revolution found effect So soon? what unknown energy has turn'd The popular tide from clamorous mutiny To speechless fear? In social confidence We still have liv'd! thy secret thoughts to me And mine to thee, were manifest as light, Since the first sacred flame of friendship glow'd In our congenial minds, in early youth: I know, and I approve the seniors arts To keep the vulgar herd in tramels due Of reverential awe to them. To this Perhaps the seeming miracle we owe For I have watch'd the doors of Adriel still Since the Patricians fled; the doors are clos'd And all is silent, those Egyptian youths Could not without the witness of those eyes Have 'scap'd, nor do they wish to 'scape! 2 Offi. Art thou An infidel to Vesta's boundless power? Could not her potent breath condense the air Or check the visual ray, and wrap the forms Of these bold Israelites in tenfold night? Could she not send from her creative womb Th'illusive image of applauding crowds Shouting revolt, and anarchy, to lead Those Hebrews, in the simulated pomp Of triumph to the snare, till in the grasp Of sovereign power, they found their feelings pay The forfeit of their cheated sight?— 2 Can. To me (Who know the arts of Priests) dost thou harangue On demon-fraud, and spectres, sent to lead The wildred wretch astray? come, come my friend! This will not pass with me; the crowd, you know Is fled, now all is safe, and silent round— Unfold your stratagem, nor doubt my prudence I owe the state too much to blast her views By letting this important secret 'scape! 2 Offi. I know thee and can trust thee: these who past And who, by this, have felt the penal fire Are not of Hebrew race! Can. Must then the pile Of this important state, by guiltless blood Be thus cemented, while the guilty spies Escape? 2 Offi. They were not guiltless, tho' their guilt Was venial; they were Idumean slaves The captives of the war. Necessity Of state oft opes the door to wider wrongs, The measure had its full effect; you find How soon it chac'd the giddy crowd away: Nought else could have assur'd their loyalty One hour! Can. And what becomes of Abdon now The factious demagogue? the Partizan Of Israel? he who lately seem'd to look Contemptuous down on Senates and on Kings From his gigantic pitch of factious power, Like him who rides the winds, and bids them range O'er land and sea, at pleasure? does he feel His cloudy throne sink from him? 2 Offi. Yet he knows not His loss, but (like a man, whose limbs are lopt In battle, in the fond illusive dream Still seems to stretch the mutilated arm And lanch in air the visionary spear Or bend the shadowy bow,) so he elate With democratic pride, harangues the lords In all the extacy of holy zeal Nor knows what victims in the rising flames Mock the fine music of his labour'd style With dying groans! But let us haste and learn With what respect the masters of the state Receive his insolent message. [Exeunt. Scene—The Senate House. King of Jericho, and Senators seated. ELIEL PRIEST of VESTA—ABDON. Eliel to Abdon. Your message is deliver'd! wait our will Abroad! but leave not these precincts, for still Thy talents may be useful to compose The madding crowd, if faction still presumes To vent her profanations to the stars And vex the sacred calm, with wild misrule; You know your duty, guards! [Exit Abdon. What think ye, fathers Of this bold demagogue, whose liberal tongue Arraigns our counsels, bids us loose the chain (Which fetters servile rage, which on the brow Of sullen Rancour throws a transient calm) And leave at liberty the lawless crowd To act as Fancy guides? does he deserve A due reward, or not? 1 Sen. Sedition seems To sleep at present, or if yet awake It dares not own its name, or seems at least Calmly to wait his answer! 2 Sen. Let him perish!— Scatter his blood among the trembling crowd The shower will lay the tempest, and assuage Their pamper'd fury! they have neither head Nor heart, if he be gone! King. Another time Will serve for that, but, fathers, what avails Our care at home, while with collected rage Fermenting long, while twice four hundred moons Have chang'd the face of night, with all the charms Of Nile, deep freighted, and the plagues that haunt The burning waste of Araby, the foe Subdues the mind within, and hangs his spells Over our trembling heads! must we renounce The boons of Nature? drink the running stream And live on pulse? with frozen apathy Turn from the glance of beauty, and resign The thrilling transport, if it costs a groan Or transient pang, to husbands, brothers, sires?— Must we do this, because a figur'd stone Deep mark'd with dread and sanguinary laws (Beyond the power of mortal to observe) Dropt from a cloud at Sinai? Shall desire Die in our bosoms, like the withering flower 'Cause some unfeeling demon has proclaim'd Thou shalt not covet? If the vagrants liv'd (As they pretend) like grashoppers, on dew Viz. The Manna. Is that a reason we should spare the flocks And lusty droves, that roam a thousand hills Or share them with our slaves? 2 Sen. We must preserve The joys for which we live, or life itself Is scarcely worth the purchase!—Nature made us For nobler purpose than to sit and pine For joys beyond our reach, and feast our souls On Virtue's visionary bliss, on joys Beyond the tomb! the heartless multitude ('Tis true,) are taught a lesson which befits Their station, and their views! to them their priests Must dwell on themes of duty and of right And bind their souls in shadowy chains at will, Unbroken till of late. But now some foe To our repose has sow'd sedition's seed Among us; even the crowd pretend to see And feel. 4 Sen. These tumults are almost compos'd Thanks to the terrours of the penal flame! Their habits of allegiance soon will reach Their old predominance! 1 Sen. Would we could soothe Those angry powers, that seem to rule the winds And waves! Eliel. And let them rule the winds and waves! What! must we dash the overflowing bowl Of blessing from our lips, because some fiends Ride the rude winds in wanton merriment To shake the coral groves below the deep, And bids the huge and cumbrous wave recede Before the wild aereal cavalry?— What if the blue stol'd nymphs of Jordan's flood By the seductive demon of the air With Zephyrean pipe allur'd, command Their fickle urns at will to ebb and flow? 'Tis all Egyptian charms, collusive spells! Between the demons of the elements And Moses, their great archimage, contriv'd! Or his successor! would they cause our dread, Let them unhinge the world, misplace the poles. Bid them unroot old Lebanon, and hurl The hills, with all their load, thro' endless space Crumble the centre, and dissolve the globe To its original atoms! can their spells Do this? Let them produce a sample of their art And shake old Vesta's time-establish'd throne! Till then our faith will stand secure and firm As Tabor or as Carmel, while the breast Of our great Viz. Vesta, or the Earth. mother can support the weight! King. Speak your opinion, fathers! is your vote Defiance, or submission? will ye die Free as ye liv'd, or bend the servile neck To Pharoah's bondmen? Senators. We submit? we cringe To Pharoah's bondmen! we detest the thought! Let them dispatch their embassy! display Their false credentials! we despise them both While those proud rampires stand! Enter a MESSENGER, who whispers ELIEL. Eliel. Be Abdon call'd. King. What message brings your envoy? Eliel. All's compos'd— Let us to Vesta's Fane, and there return Thanks for the great deliverance! King. Lead the way! [Ex. Omn. ACT IV. Scene—An Hall in the House of Adriel. Enter ACHAN. ACHAN Repuls'd! contemn'd! and by a Gentile maid! And with such dignity of look and mein As ill befits her humble birth! Oh Fate! Oh! thou fallacious Power!—whate'er thy name Who seem'd with ready hand to smooth my way To transport! thou who led'st my rival hence And left an open field to Love and me— Whence these new obstacles? manhood, and pride And love will tell, they're meant to stimulate And they shall stimulate!—for oh! her charms In our last interview, her sparkling eyes In all their pride of scorn, have waken'd here A conflagration!—Love and Vengeance calls And both shall soon be satisfied! The rage Of Faction slumbers in the streets at last— Even panic finds a pause, the guests and slaves Who left the house to mingle with the crowd Impell'd by curiosity or dread Will soon return, this moment then is mine! [Going Enter ZALMON. Achan Aside. Baffled again! perdition to my hopes What fiend, who loves to riot on my pangs Has sent him here again?— To him. Ha! Zalmon! why This quick return? Zal. The gates are all beset, The rampires mann'd, let that apology Suffice for me! But—or my guess is wrong Or, if no vision of the night deceiv'd My sight, I saw you on the point to pass The bounds of right, and violate the hour Of virgin privacy, now, what pretext What artful gloss can palliate this attempt? Ach. And who gives thee the privilege to sit In judgment on my deeds? Zal. Thou own'st it then! That was not needed, for thy looks declare Too plain, the purpose of thy heart,—and thou A delegate from Israel, chosen by lot Mark'd and distinguished by the hand of Heaven Among those unbelievers, to display A specimen of sanctity, of truth And all the dignity of self-command, To gain their veneration for the laws Of them, whom Heaven for their forefathers worth So highly favours!—Thou, at such a time On such a business sent, to loose the rein From the wild passions, to profane the flame Of plighted love, and burst the sacred bar Of hospitality, and social faith!— Repent, my friend! and bless that providence That cross'd th'unrighteous purpose! Ach. I deny The charge! Zal. O trifle not with him, whose eye Pervades the soul! nor aggravate thy guilt By bold presumption! Ach. Who commissioned thee (If limits are so sacred) to assume The Levites office? Go! proud moralist! Go to the camp of Israel, and proclaim My guilt! But other cares possess thy soul— —That public love which lately flam'd so high Has spent its fury, and a gentler spark Of lambent radiance takes its turn to reign!— This bids you shun the wide nocturnal range Thro' perils and thro' foes, to Joshua's camp, And rather linger round these favourite walks For some blest opportunity to soothe The fair one's fears! Zal. 'Tis well—retort the charge And spend the precious moments (while we stand Perhaps, on the tremendous verge of fate) In fierce recrimination! but thy mind Acquits me, or if not, when Zalmon's soul Is better known, perhaps, it may deserve Thy approbation,—no sinister views But strong necessity forbade my flight And sent me here—to save thee from thy self At present thy worst foe.—Reflect on this! And learn to know thy friend! Ach. Thy words I fear Are too prophetic!—Pardon my rash tongue And thoughtless folly!—we already stand Upon the verge of fate—for hark—the crowd Returns, as from the gale that hither wafts Their mingled voices, we may learn! Enter RAHAB, in great disorder. Rah. Oh my protectors! oh my gallant friends Would Heaven! the life which you so lately sav'd Could ransom yours! I fear you are beset And nought your valour will avail if true The tidings I have heard—and Abdon too Is absent, who perhaps, could sway his friends To save you. Achan Aside. Thank my plots! by them a friend Is lost, who now might shield us! Zal. Say, fair maid, Whence thy intelligence? Rah. 'Tis needless now To tell!—but ere these now forsaken walls Admit their wonted guests, if ye obey My counsel, and to me intrust your safety, (Which, as the precious jewel of my soul! I'll guard, to my best power) I yet may pay Some part of that vast debt of gratitude Which, while remembrance lives, I still must owe. Zal. Our lives are in the hand of Heaven! to that We trust! But, it were madness to reject Thy counsel, beauteous maid! for Heaven perhaps May to thy pure and guiltless mind, suggest The means of safety, which, with gratitude To thee, and to that power, who rais'd our hands To guard thee, and inspir'd thy spotless mind With magnanimity to pay the debt We gladly chuse, and in thy faith confide.— Yet still, in one essential point, thy will Must yield to ours—we must not leave these walls— Heaven's hand can find and guards us here—even here.— Where we experienc'd late its signal aid— But to forsake thee here—to leave thy life Thy precious life, perhaps a pledge for ours— To fly ignobly, and to gain the camp Whilst thou, surrounded by thy foes and ours Art doom'd to pay the forfeit,—this would blot Our names with endless infamy, the name Of Israel too must suffer, even the cause Of God, the cause of virtue, public love (For which we bear the delegated sword) Would catch the foul contagion, and become An object of abhorrence, meant by Heaven For ends far different. Achan Aside. Then my fears are true (Were this a time for lesser fears) his heart Is touch'd, as well as mine! Rah. This is no time For nice punctilio—did I mean to thwart Your generous purpose, you must wait an hour Yet more propitious to your flight,, and deign To take th'asylum, which those walls afford Till Heaven permits escape. There is a place As secret as the grave, which even the eye Of Malice and Revenge's eagle glance Might scrutinize in vain. Zal. But generous maid! This must be stipulated first—we live Conceal'd, whilst thou art safe—when danger threats, Give thou the signal, and we fly to save thee Not on ourselves presuming, but inspir'd By confidence in him, who nerves the hands Of infants, at his pleasure, to subdue The warriour, clad in steel! Rah. What Heaven suggests I'll do!—but you with resignation wait The great event, and let no sudden start Of thoughtless courage—no suggested fear For me, entice you to forsake your post Till first you hear the signal; all your hopes The very crisis of your fate depends Upon your silence! let not even your breath Be heard, if possible. Zal. Whence has this maid Such more than manly piety, such faith And fortitude? O virgin! in thy voice I hear and I obey the call of Heaven! But whence this dignity of mind? this sense Of heavenly interference far beyond Their faith, who live within the glorious dawn Of Heaven's illumination? Rah. Stay not now To question, for the time forbids delay. [Exeunt. Scene Continues. Enter ELIEZER. Where are those guests, whose presence has expell'd Peace, harmony, and mutual confidence From those devoted towers, and in their stead Sent loud revolt to bellow round our streets And gave that treason, which had lurk'd in thought A body and a voice, embrued the hands Of fiery zealots in my best friends blood? Oh they are gone! they chose the season well, To 'scape the snare, and leave a nobler life To sate the fell Patricians rage! they might Have spar'd my friend; the wretched pair who fed The penal flames with blood, has laid the gust Of popular frenzy and revolt! O night Foul nurse of anarchy and dark misdeeds! Sedition, treason, mutiny and blood Like hideous phantoms on thy moonless march Attend, and yet thou hast not reach'd the point Of thy disastrous noon! what monstrous births What prodigies must yet amaze the stars Before the purple messenger of morn Arrest thee in thy course? does Rahab sleep? Can Rahab rest, while fate with rigorous hand Perhaps already stops her source of life? Her lover too, her plighted spouse, my friend My Abdon lost! Enter RAHAB. Rah. What mean your dreadful words? My Abdon lost! Oh Eliezer! say I have mistook your meaning? Eliez. Would to Heaven You had!—It is a night of dire mistakes And this had been a blest one! I could wish That thou would'st guess my errand, without words. Rah. What of my Abdon? Eliez. Perish he, who first To his too dauntless mind suggested late That luckless embassy; some Achan,—See Act Second, Scene Last. demon told The jealous Peers, that he was join'd in league With those audacious strangers, deem'd the spies Of Israel, whose bold rescue in the face Of open outrage, fill'd our streets with dread And turn'd this tide of mutiny against Our haughty rulers, they, as fame reports At first were struck with fear, when Abdon's zeal Display'd their danger in such dreadful forms As made the boldest quake; but soon 'tis said On a dark message to Eliel sent The gallant youth was seiz'd, and waits in chains His sentence! Rah. Oh unhappy youth! what crime What charge can Malice or Revenge invent Against him? Eliez. Well his innocence is known Even to his bitterest foes, but other captives Groan in the self-same danger! Roh. Who are they? Concerns it me to know? can there be grief Beyond what I have suffered? Eliez. I were cruel To aggravate your woes! but on the verge Of fate your safety stands, and it depends On you perhaps, to turn the dubious scale— Reflect on that, let that support your mind Under a second blow! Rah. I stand prepar'd— Whate'er the dreadful certainty, suspence Is worse. Eliez. Thy reverend father too is join'd In equal doom! Rah. And why do I remain Exempt from bonds, when all I held most dear Are in the grasp of fate!— Eliez. Thy hands, perhaps Are by the bounteous gods at freedom left To loose their chains, else I had never come Th'unwelcome messenger of ill to thee— Those strangers, who are deem'd the lurking spies Of Joshua, yet perhaps, within the walls Remain—for all retreat is closely barr'd, 'Tis true, they have protected thee from worse Than death, and thou might'st seem by every tie Of gratitude and friendship bound to aid Their flight, but Piety's superior laws Thy country's claims; thy faith to Abdon vow'd Silence the claims of pity! at this hour The scrutiny begins, and in those bounds They cannot rest secure; but let thy zeal Prevent the search! explore their secret haunts! (If yet these walls contain them) and resign Thy captives to the king, thy promptitude And filial piety may calm their rage, Prevent undue suspicions, which prevail Of thy apostacy from Canaan's Gods, And gain the captives freedom, else their lives Perhaps may pay the forfeit! I decline The sight of strangers—mark my last advice And use the precious moments as becomes The daughter and the spouse! I must begone! For some are entering whom I must not see! Rah. O let thy presence aid me! Eliez. While I'm free I can assist you still! I might be deem'd Abdon's accomplice, as I'm known his friend If I should be observ'd, adieu, adieu! Exit. Rah. O dreadful turn of fate! O test severe Of filial duty! what shall I resolve At this tremendous moment? but no time Is left me to resolve!—perhaps the flame The penal flame, so lately fed with gore Waits for another victim!

By generous care Of me, those gallant strangers have become Obnoxious to the state! they might have 'scap'd All observation, and have pass'd the gates Unnotic'd as the vulgar herd, that crowd This mansion daily, had they brook'd the sight Of violation, with unkindling hearts, And unavenging hands; and they must die,— And I must be their murderess!—so the fates And cruel duty bid, yes—I must be A traitress, or a parricide!—Oh Heavens How shall I bear the thought! a bleeding father A mangled lover; and shall I—shall I Endure such weight of horror and preserve My intellects!—But let me pause awhile And at the stillness of this solemn hour When not a friend is near, with mental beam To guide my fault'ring feet, let me address My fervent sorrows to the fount of light To dispossess the darkness of the soul And shew me what is best; to him the day And darkness are alike, the mental eye Contemplates him, when outward things are hid Behind the deep nocturnal veil! A guide Like him, altho' he points a painful path Must lead me right—O thou great origin Of rectitude and truth, do thou preside O'er my deliberations, whilst I weigh Duty with duty in th'unbyast scale! Be still ye stormy passions! leave my soul Blest with that sacred calm, where Reason's light And favouring conscience, with unruffled beam Enlightens, like twin stars, the tranquil mind!

What tho' thy sire is bound “And Abdon; thy mistaken piety “Might fail to free them,—should thy female fears “Resign the great deposit, art thou sure “Thy resignation would redeem their blood? “And wilt thou, to secure a dubious good “Risque an undoubted crime? suppose it true “(As yet 'tis doubtful) that thy friends are held “In durance, does it follow they must fall “Unrespited and unrepriev'd? some time “At worst will be allow'd, and Israel's host “May interpose to save them if the spies “Escape to expedite their march.—Already “As if secure of conquest, have they told “The means, to save thy few remaining friends “Amid the general ruin, when the sons “Of Jacob with commission'd sword and flame “Purge the pollutions of the land!—this roof “Must then be their asylum, as the ark “Of Noah, sacred, and secure from harm, “When nought but desolation reigns abroad “In solitary pomp, with horrour crown'd.— “Then like that sacred Germ of nations sav'd “From the great world of waters, dark and deep, “These walls, the refuge of the righteous few “Shall be the cradle of the nascent state, “From piety deriving manners pure “Their love of God, express'd by love of man.” Shall I the pupil of ignoble Fear Renounce this elevated hope?

Ha, this is wonderful! where are the crowds Who fill'd those rooms with barb'rous harmony Hymning the bounteous mother of the tribes Of life and vegetation? all is dark Silent and lonely! not a voice is heard Nor face appears! either the Hebrew spies Have chosen a lucky moment to escape Or some new wonder by their God display'd In their protection, has expell'd their foes. 2 Gua. We shall not linger long in dark suspense; For here comes one, whose ready diligence Would with a fervent scrutiny, assist Our search, if they remain! her hand would help To drag them to their doom, for she has cause— The safety of a father and a friend Depending on their seizure!

Oh may it not affect the precious lives For which I will implore the King, the state, That they are now beyond your reach and mine! 1 Gua. How did they 'scape? Rah.

But tell Did they, confiding in your fears, depart In bold defiance of opposing powers In public, unmolested? Rah What I know My duty bids me tell! I did not see Their flight, I was not station'd here their guard; But is it probable, that strangers, guests That menials, void of manhood, as of worth Could stand the terrour of their deadly looks When warriours fled amaz'd! But oh my father My Abdon! where are they, what dungeon's gloom Contains them? can you tell, what sentence waits Their guiltless heads? 2 Gua. Unless the spies are found (With whom thy friends are held accomplices) I would not have their fears for all the wealth From Ganges to the Nile! 1 Gua. Hard of belief By nature, I am apt to doubt report— How could they pass our loftiness of wall Which but the winged vagrants of the sky Nought can surmount? did that aereal siend (Whom as 'tis said, they serve) with some new spells Fledge them with pinions to ascend the clouds And mock our vengeance, or conduct them down A subterranean pass, like eyeless moles? The Vesta. bounteous mother would not see profan'd The awful boundaries of her unsunn'd realms By visitors so hated: hence, I deem They still are here conceal'd! Rah. Pursue your search!— If aught you find to taint my innocence Let me be doom'd with Abdon [aside] their design Is to enforce discovery, by these threats,— Not meant to be accomplished; and kind heaven At last will save my friends— 2 Gua. to the first. Her confidence And unembarrass'd air amaze my soul! The spies are 'scap'd—or soon her piety Her love of Abdon, and her female fears Had mark'd the secret, were they here conceal'd. 1 Gua. Yet were they gone, her fears for Abdon's life And for her aged sire, had shown their power By stronger symptoms!— 2 Gua. to Rah. Young dissembler! say What mean you thus to dally with the fate Of all that's dear, at such a time as this? 1 Gua. This is no time to trifle; our return Ere this is look'd for; wilt thou lead the way And shew the dark recesses of thy house?— (They may be here conceal'd unknown to thee) Let us complete the search? Rah. It suits not me A virgin and alone, at this dark hour To take a part in such a scene, but go— No bolt nor bar prevents you! every door Is open, as you see! 3 Gua. An easier call (If here they lurk) may bring them to our lure, And save our time and toil? 2 Gua. What dost thou mean? 3 Gua. You know how fierce their Hebrew spirits flam'd Contemning all disguise, when late the Lords Meant to have borne this lovely prize away!— She too is charg'd with treason to the state And to the Gods: if we should bear her hence The slightest shew of violence to her Her struggles and her cries, (if she resist) Would have th'effect of lightning, and soon rouse The lions from their dens. 1 Gua. This is no time For such experiments! 3 Gua. I serve the state, And scruple not to use whatever means Can to her service best conduce! [Seizes Rahab. Rah. Ye powers Of Heaven! look down and succour, since no friend On earth is left me. [Thunder and lightning—the guards stand aghast. 1 Gua. Oh Ashtaroth! what may these terrours mean? Rah. Thanks to th'eternal powers, which, twice this night Have listn'd to a trembling virgin's prayer. 1 Gua. to third I knew your violence would wake the wrath Of some offended God—pursue the search! Tho' that I fear is vain!— 2 Gua. Pursue the search! Bid me to meet the anger of our lords! They are but men, and bounded in their power But to defy the lifted bolt of Heaven To rush on sure destruction, is above My daring! 4 Gua. What if now the sulph'rous stores Of Heaven are opening, and our doom begun, Like ancient Sodom? 5 Gua. Whether here or hence Those terrible divinities, who sav'd Their lives, so oft in jeopardy this night, Protects them still! Rah. aside. Oh heavenly truth! compell'd From impious lips! even the profane confess The hand of Heaven! 1 Gua. Then what detains us here When our destruction, like a whirlwind, soon May overwhelm us! let us hence and tell Our success to the state! 2 Gua. If they should doubt Our truth, let these undaunted lords who know The spot, who lately show'd their prowess here, Let them, who know the persons of the spies, And from a legion, by their guilty looks Could easily select them—let them come, And try their fate on this distinguish'd field. I war not with the fates, remain who will! [Exit Guards. Rah. Author of Nature! thou hast heard my prayers, Thy answer came in thunder—but to me More welcome than the shepherd's pipe at morn! I pray'd, that if you meant your servants 'scape, These ruffians, eager in the scent of blood, Who snuff the coming slaughter like the breeze From Sharon's vale, should faulter in the chace, Thou spok'st the word, they trembled and they paus'd!— —So ought not I to pause, the thunder's voice [Thunder again. Again, and louder, warns me hence to aid The Hebrews' flight, while terrour chains their foes. [Exit, and returns with Zalmon and Achan. Rah. Your trust in heaven is not in vain, behold Its terrours march before you, and prepare Your way! Deliverance comes in lightning clad, And arm'd with thunder, where it leads, pursue With boldness! I have seen the guards retire Aghast, before the winged flame that sweeps Yon battlements which overlook the roof And every pass command! the midnight storm Has left an awful solitude around.— Where on the city walls our rafters lean There is a window unobserv'd, but full In view, if any watch'd; thro' this a cord Provided by my care, shall bear your weight Safe down the dizzy height, till on the ground You fix your feet, then speed you to the plain. Ach. But you are still in danger! Rah. Let no thought Of me, delay your flight—the guards but now Were here, intent to search with rigid care Where'er suspicion pointed, but the voice Of Heaven no sooner thunder'd in their ears, Than all aghast they fled. No doubt remains But long ere this the panic has begun To seize their Lords, and each vindictive thought Is swallowed up in fear, they have no time At this dread crisis to enquire of me Or punish misdemeanours; on your faith And not on them, my future hope depends And on your God!—They are below my dread. Zal. And God so deal with us as we preserve This house of refuge!—this asylum pure! And all, who share your blood, or by the ties Of nobler friendship join'd, (the ties of soul) Claim your protection—Now adieu! may Heaven Continue still to guard you, and display The merits of thy boundless trust in Him Which draws the wonder of applauding saints Even thro' this midnight gloom! it soon shall vye With the meridian splendours of the sun A bright example to the nations round! [Ex. Spies. Enter ELIEZER. Cowards! oh abject cowards! to return Without their errand! may their angry lords Give them their due reward! The spies, they say, Are 'scap'd: How 'scap'd? The walls are mann'd around! The gates are barr'd and guarded—Heaven! Earth! Hell! Are all the warring elements in league With these Egyptians? Must a panic seize Our boldest hearts? and oh, my friend! my friend! Must thy devoted blood our temples stain, To welcome these dire visitants? Thou too Befriended them! And is it thus they pay Thy friendship? Is it thus their gods defend The favourers of their cause? My reason reels In clouds and darkness wandering—tost and whelm'd Amid contending thoughts! the hoary sire Must perish with the son! Could Rahab save Those Hebrews with the ransom of such blood? Nature revolts at such a thought! The pard, The lion, or the tyger would renounce Their nature, and put on humanity At such a double claim! Oh had I join'd These heartless messengers, not fire nor sword Had hinder'd me to ransack every room, And know at least the certainty! But here She comes! no sign of guilt is in that face! No sign of dread! Alas! unhappy maid! You little know, what raven notes must wound Your ear! Rah. They are escap'd, and all is safe! But what again brings Eliezer here So soon, and with such signs of deep despair Stampt on his visage! Oh, I fear the worst! Eliez. Aside. My mercies must be cruelties! To find Her guilt, or innocence, I must at once Divulge the fatal news. Rah. What hopes, my friend, Of Abdon's pardon or escape? Eliez. Thy sire And Abdon soon will 'scape, and soon defy The proud Patricians utmost rage! Rah. I like Thy message, better than thy looks! Eliez. My looks Bely not my intent! Thy Hebrew spies Are 'scap'd, however, if their happy flight Can recompense the loss! Rah. Of what! oh speak! Eliez. I have no heart to tell thee! thou wilt know Too soon! Conceal thee quickly. Vengeance calls Upon thy name, and brands thee with the stain Of parricide. I would not have thy blood! And must not here be found. [Exit. Rah. And let them come, I will not once attempt To hide me from their rage! A parricide! Adriel! it cannot be! and Abdon too, Fall'n in the cause of Israel, fall'n to save These spies' devoted heads! and I to screen My country's foes! and let a father's hairs His few grey hairs, sink to the grave in blood! Is this the way that heaven rewards its friends In Israel's cause! itself the cause of heaven! No matter! soon a teacher will arrive Whose bloody steel will cut the gordian knot Of those dark topics, and I'll rest in peace.— Make haste, ye ruffians, seize the parricide! I would not live had I a thousand worlds Giv'n me to live beneath the horrid sense Of such an imputation! Ought I not (If I must die) to try if yet my blood Can save my sire's? the blow may not be given. It cannot be! I go, I fly to save him, And crown my fall with glory! But again [Thunder. The awful noise of heaven is heard—again Its lightning darts around—oh no, this blaze Of glory comes not from contending clouds!— What heavenly visitant is this! O spare, Spare me if I have sinn'd! ANGEL. Be not dismay'd! Thou more than conqueress in the cause of truth! Know thine own merit and the just applause Thy faith, thy conflicts, and thy strength of mind (The glorious harvest from the heavenly seeds So early sown) have won; they are the themes Of more than mortal minstrelsie; Rah. O thou The messenger of other worlds, that tellest Of things beyond the stars! hast thou beheld The secrets of the dungeon? Hast thou heard A father's murder, calling for revenge Against an impious daughter? Angel. Check thy tears, And tell thy anxious heart thy father lives! He lives in bonds, but soon a viewless hand Shall shake his prison walls without a blast To ruin, and the reverend captive free.— Thy Abdon martyr'd in the glorious cause Has seal'd his testimony with his blood. This was conceal'd from thee! Thy love, perhaps, Had led thee to have shar'd his fate, thy zeal Could not have sav'd him, tho' it sunk thyself In ruin! But be comforted, he lives Who can supply his loss—an Hebrew chief, Matchless in worth, and terrible in war, Soon shall awake the deep-mouth'd storm that lays These rampires low! his kind protecting hand Shall guard thee thro' the hurricane, and raise Thy humble fortunes from their lowly state To match with kings, a name above all kings Shall grace thy lineage and extend his sway O'er nations yet unborn, and climes unknown. FINIS. THE RIVALS, A SACRED DRAMA. ARGUMENT. Achan, instigated by jealousy of Zalmon, and the suggestions of Phanuel, a Zidonian proselyte, and, at the same time, doubtful of his own merit to obtain the object of his passion, employs sinister means to aggrandize himself; and not only to supplant, but to destroy his rival. The incidents produced by this opposition of interest and character, are the subjects of the following poem. THE RIVALS, A SACRED DRAMA. PERSONS. Joshua, General of the Israelites. Phineas, the High Priest. Zabdi, a noble Israelite of the house of Judah. Zalmon, representative of the eldest branch of Judah. Achan, son to Zabdi. Aboliah, an herald. Phanuel, a Zidonian proselyte. Israelites. See Joshua, 7th Chap. [ACT I.] Scene.—A Camp: the Ruins of Jericho, seen at a distance. JOSHUA, PHINEAS, ABOLIAH, the Leaders of the ISRAELITES—The Army drawn up in Battalia. Military Music. Joshua. Cease your vain minstrelsie! nor raise the wrath Of Heaven with sounds profane!—for, if I judge Aright, all is not harmony within!— [Music ceases. Can it be so, ye Israelites! that you, For whom th'eternal laws that rule the globe Suffer tremendous change, that you for whom The waters rose in chrystal pride, yon walls In all their pomp of loftiest masonry Sunk to the level of the stagnant pool That you, in heavenly favour rank'd so high, Cloth'd in such dreadful dignity, should dare, In proud defiance of Heaven's late commands, To long for tinsel toys, for glittering gems That shed below a pale fantastic day Thro' subterranean worlds, in dubious gleam? You that were born to gaze on yonder sun And lift your glory to the wondering stars! Degenerate warriours, can you thus forget Already the Almighty hand which laid Yon rampires low! if ye provoke him far Your secret prayers may draw his vengeance down By granting what you wish, the yawning earth May send you down, with living eyes, to see The sunless scenes, where Mammon sits in gold Amidst his mineral glories high enthron'd In the mock splendours of malignant light,— Dread this, ye rebels!—Are the cohorts gone To summon Ai's proud sons? Abol. They are, my Lord! Jos. We dread the consequence, unless your tears And penitence appease the Power incenst Who led us here! Yet still he condescends By me to warn you, nay, more humble still, He means to your own reason to submit The motives of your mission, and his wrath, Against the nations round! He chuses no: By regal interdict your hands to bind, Nor deign to tell you why. He now repeats By me his motives, tho' vouchsaf'd before, To bend your stubborn minds (if aught can bend) Or leave you nought to plead. 'Twas not for spoils, 'Twas not to fight amid the raging flames For molten ore. 'Twas not to strip the dead, And load our groaning waggons with the stores Of sacrilege—from Baalim's shrines to rend The offering of pollution, silver, gold, And gems, (by vice and idol rites profan'd) For which from trembling Nile, the hand of Heaven Led us thro' high suspended seas, that flank'd Our passing files with horrours all their own!— 'Twas not for this the sovereign voice of heaven Summon'd the sounding waters from our way— Upon th'eternal turbulence of floods Imposing solemn pause. 'Twas not for this Yon well-compacted masonry, that slept For many a slow-revolving moon unmov'd, In rigorous repose, at the dread sound Of Aaron's hallowed trumps forget to sleep, And left their limy beds in dreadful dance Like Nature's last convulsion! Had the will Of Heaven design'd to give us splendid seats; In silken luxury to lap our limbs, To bid us court the gales in groves of palm, Or citron shades beside meand'ring rills, To form our beds of down, to bind our brows With gemmy lustre, and to load our board With all the luxuries of sea and air, With all that haunt the streamlet and the grove: For this, he might have led us to the springs Of Nile, or sent us west to fix our seats On Tingitana's fair Atlantic shore, Where still th'indefatigable soil Teems with her annual bounty, unimpair'd, Her plains with harvests deep, her jocund hill With viny chaplets crown'd, and olives gay. —But it was not for this that Israel's god Selected us among the numerous tribes That roam the face of earth; his favouring care, Not always by such blessings is dispens'd— They often snare the soul! It was to keep His sacred law inviolate, and pure, Which figures scenes more splendid yet to come. —It was, by our high-fortun'd state to shew The nations round what glories crown the heads Of the obedient, we his instruments Of equitable wrath and vengeance just Were sent to scourge his foes, to seize the soil Which thro' their crimes, (if they persist in crimes) They forfeit to their founder: should we seize The glittering spoils selected from the war The price of blood and tears, oblations meet For these fell spirits, whose polluted fanes Their treasures deck'd (fit bribes to conjure down Their demon favours on the future deeds Of violence and outrage) should the tribes Of God, with such vile dross profane their hands. Soon the contamination from the palm Would reach the deep-infected mind, and taint The chosen people with the sin that drew Perdition on our foes. Then obloquy Would hunt along our execrated names From age to age, with this well-earn'd reproach “These are the hypocrites, that scourg'd the world, “Pretending Heaven's commission, to destroy “His foes, and thro' the nations to dispense “Heaven's vengeance at their will: but lust of gold “Not love of right, nor piety impell'd “Their furious expedition, else their care “Had shunn'd the taint of crimes which they themselves “Were sent to punish, not to patronize. “Thus Heaven is partial, or they too had felt “For their foul deeds, her vengeance in their turn, “Or all is by the hand of Chance dispens'd!”— Thus were Heavens' name blasphem'd, her holy law Brought into foul reproach by us, whom Heaven Had like a flaming beacon on a hill, Sent, as a warning to the nations round Of kindling wrath!— Beware then—lest your waning light be lost In dim eclipse, and Stygian fogs obscure Your luminary, till it sets in night, Primæval night, and Heaven's impartial hand, Select another lamp to shed around The mental beam unsullied—would you shun This foul reproach and ruin;—would you wish To keep th'unutterable name unblam'd?— Teach your hands continence! instruct your eyes To view the pride of Tyrian looms, the stores Of Babylon, of Ormus, and of Ind, Without a languishing unsated gaze, So shall Jehovah lead your armies forth, So shall your heaven-commission'd sabres wear An unabated edge, and Canaan's tribes Sink at the growing terrours of your name! Phin. Joshua! Your dread remonstrance has expell'd (If I conjecture right) the lurking pest, If any yet remains,—the signs of awe And penitence pervade the mighty host! Josh. 'Tis well! it were a shame, that Gentile breasts Should own a sense of duty, far beyond Our feebler feelings! think on Rahab's worth! Think on what bribes she scorn'd, her parent's life, Her lover's (not to speak of meaner things, Riches and honours) had she broke the laws Of hospitality, and given our spies To Canaan's rage!—Her piety to heaven Preferr'd the sacred voice of sovereign truth, Of pure unbias'd reason! Be it thine, Aboliah, to take care, that with respect Worthy her merit, the distinguish'd fair May be receiv'd! Abol. Your orders are obey'd. The gratitude of Achan for a life Redeem'd by her, has tax'd his diligence To match the maid's reception to her worth. —His cohorts form her guard, in all the pomp Of eastern majesty, as if some queen From distant Aram, or from Elam's plains, Had deign'd to visit us! Josh. Some future time, we will consult the means Her merit and her suffering to reward. —Meantime the evening sacrifice awaits Our presence, let the general host attend! [Military Music. Exeunt. Scene.—Another part of the Camp.—Same prospect. PHANUEL, ACHAN. Phan. Despise his menace! what concerns it thee, Who, when the awful interdict was given, Wast absent? What was done, thou well may'st plead, Was done before the mandate met your ear! You were employ'd on an important charge Apart, the care of Rahab! that may calm Your fears, if any terrours yet remain. Ach. My former doubts are nearly all dispell'd, Whether celestial vengeance min'd yon towers, Or if they fell by chance, seems dubious yet.— For grant the first, that unremitting hand That checks the torrents roar, and whelms the mound Before our dreadful march, benignant, seems My secret views to favour: All my hopes Seem ripening fast—my eldest rival fell In yon proud city's ruin; at my word The snares of death enclos'd him, nor was I To blame! See Temple of Vesta, Act II. Scene Last. I only gave his frenzy way, And he himself, with voluntary hand Drew down perdition, by his country's love (Vain meteor) led to fling his life away!— But when I weigh my merit with the worth Of Rahab; when I think on Zalmon's love I feel despair with chilling hand arrest My heart, and blast the spring of all my joys! Phan. Your humbleness of mind has had its use. Even your desponding thoughts have urg'd you on, To lay your basis firm and deep, beyond The storm of Fortune, or the sapp of Fate.— Nor yet indulge these fears! when they prevail They check the active powers! attend to Hope, And hear what she suggests! Could Heaven dispose The chain of things, that since have come to pass, More prosperous to thy view? The priestly hand (As if the plunder'd gold had touch'd his palm) Has cast the lot on Zalmon, to conduct Our chosen legions to the fields of Ai, Your second rival leaves the lists to thee. The lovely maid is left within thy guard, But thou, as if with him thy better mind Were fled, in ling'ring doubt mispend'st the hours That courts thee to thy hopes! Address the fair With all the fervency of love, assail Her yielding heart; you own she has not yet Repell'd your vows, nor shewn the least surmise That she suspects thee for her lover's fate. Ach. She does not. But the time is adverse yet, To amorous parly, while the recent loss Of that lov'd youth, with all the tyranny Of grief, usurps her soul: a day will come To dry her tears! Phan. And Zalmon may return. —Thus to the negligent, or fearful man, Fresh obstacles spring up, like noxious weeds That choke the sluggard's field! Ach. I dread his worth, 'Tis true; and his is not a heart that scorns The softer passion! But my hopes arise From this reflection, that his bosom burns With fiercer flame for glory, which he calls A godlike zeal. In him the mighty minds Of all his great progenitors survive, And oft the splendid prospects See the Promises to the Tribe of Judah, Gen. 49. of our tribe Mount his aspiring soul above the moon. His is the elder branch, the regal rod By Jacob promis'd to great Judah's line, He deems will grace his progeny at last! Phan. His pride may here deceive him! To the line At large the promise is bestow'd, and thou Claim'st equal right with him, for in thy veins Flows the pure blood of Phares, as in his.— In Israel oft the younger has usurp'd His elder's birthright, by his merits won— Witness your great progenitor himself, Who won the blessing, by old Isaac meant For his degenerate brother. Ach. This when time Accords. But, meantime, be it far from me To thwart his princely pride with any claims Of mine, ambitious to transmit the line To after ages pure! Be mine the task With recent fuel still to feed his pride; On this I'll build, with cautious vigilance.— To be prepar'd for all emergencies Becomes th'attentive mind that means to rise.— Should Zalmon from the fields of Ai return In triumph; by success his native pride Would only flame the higher; he suspects Not yet my love for Rahab, and to me His kinsman, late his fellow envoy, deigns Familiar audience; then my ready art Will paint his purpose to debase the blood With gentile Canaan's, in so foul a shape As soon must turn his passion to disgust!— Phan. And will you miss the fair occasion given To bear her hence beneath the friendly veil Of night that favours amorous thefts? thy stores Snatch'd from the ruins of yon smoaking walls Might bribe a legion! from the multitude Who at our General's interdict repine Which robs them of their spoils! the soldiers due Our toil has form'd a small but faithful band— Those, tir'd to bear the double discipline Of poverty and war, resolve to win And wear the glittering spoil: Thy secret hoard Of wealth, affords enough to cloy the wish Of Avarice, and leave enough besides To give you rank, where'er you fix your seat And dignity, above your utmost hopes— —Before the full moon wanes, my friends shall bear The lovely fugitive to Gaza's shore— —Thy care, I hope, has chosen for her guard A man to thee devoted! Ach. None are there But what have tasted, or expect to taste My bounty: for the pruning hook and spade Their future portion here, they long to share A less laborious lot. Phan. Then why delay? In Gaza's friendly port, the brigandine Mann'd by Sidonians, waits her welcome freight. Ach. The winds are adverse still! Phan. But on yon heights That front the rising sun, the vapours tell That the deep current of the air, which flow'd Eastward, begins to ebb, and soon will turn Towards the West, and sweep with sounding wing The sands: for so the balance of the sky Requires, still changing with alternate sway. Ach. Our voyage thence to Sidon by the shores Is long and dangerous! Phan. But on Sidon's shore A splendid settlement awaits the man Who carries riches thither, they are poor But like the frugal bee, that ceaseless roves From flower to flower, industrious. So they roam From isle to isle, thro' all the sea-girt bounds Of Javan, with an ever-changing freight Where'er necessity impells their fails.— —Thy riches there would raise thee to a height Above the poor and limitary Kings Whose little realms in those umbrageous vales Are lost, or on the cliff-crown'd hills afar Their frontier castles meet with hostile frown And parcel out the rock: But there, the power That rules the main, shall see thy vessels plow Her foamy bosom to the distant shores Of Gades and Atlantis, thee the winds Shall all obey, and smooth their ruffian plumes To bring thy precious bales to Sidon's coast. Thy hostile keels, on this devoted land May pour thy well paid legions, and subdue Their rude militia, at thy splendid files Amaz'd: thy scythed cars may sweep their plains Thy skilful mercenaries from the bounds This exaggeration is meant to impose upon Achan's credulityOf Chettim brought, (for deeds of arms renown'd) Will teach to force the gate, the mound to scale To point the column, and with wheel reverse. To flank the Hebrew's trembling host, and pour Confusion on the rear,—was not the rod Of royalty to Judah's line decreed? And art thou not of Judah's line? perhaps Thy victor files, from Sidon's border led May give the promis'd crown, and Lebanon From his imperial brow beholds his groves His tributary groves, already wait Thy destin'd steel his glory to extend And bid his stately timbers plow their way Thro yon proud surge, to visit other worlds Beyond the seeming boundless deep, and then Say, wilt thou linger here, and trust your hopes To Passions veering gale, to the poor chance That Zalmon's lordly mind may scorn the maid Of alien and of humble race? away! Trust not the fickle balance of the soul Dependent on a breeze! the steady breath Of Fortune or of Fate distends thy sail!— The fair occasion smiles, like yonder moon! But envious clouds may soon eclipse her light And envious fiends may cross thy favour'd way If thou shouldst faulter now!— Ach. Thy friendly zeal Demands my thanks: yet Phanuel! Oh my friend Great is the hazard, unappriz'd! unwarn'd, To bear her hence, unconscious as I am If I possess such interest in her heart As may assure my pardon! Phan. Thou a man A soldier, and dismay'd? forget thy fear! And tell thy flattering heart, the sex forgive All ills their beauties cause!— Ach. Yet truest love Is mixt with awe: But fate commands—I go To spring the mine that ruins or exalts My hopes for ever. [Exit Achan. Phan. Go! believing fool! Clear sighted to the specious arts of priests And scorning superstition, but involv'd In double darkness by thy easy faith In man—thou knowest not yet, but soon shalt learn When the deep surge o'erwhelms thee, that thou art No more but Phanuel's tool—but go and bear Thy treasures and thy future bride on board!— —What means this phantom? or I dream, or night Deceives me with her soul-appalling shapes Or he again is here, and Zalmon too Mysterious Fate!—or Chance!—or are there Gods That thwart our purpose? But be calm! my soul!— PHANUEL, ZALMON, ACHAN. Phan. Zalmon return'd so soon? is Ai subdued? Zal. Go ask the dead, which lie around her gates! The flower of Israel fallen! I met my friend And brought him back, for he and thou art call'd This instant to the General's tent to see A second levy by the sacred lots! Phan. Then be it so!—and have the sacred lots Decided thus already?—But—for thee They managed well—thy 'scape declares their truth Tho' still the hostile troops exulting threat! Was it the part of Zalmon to return And leave his gallant troops without a head Or heart? Zal. How much I scorn to clear my fame To thee, my silence soon could shew! but thou My friend in danger, who hast seen my deeds Shalt know, that here, in the inglorious lap Of Safety, Zalmon ne'er shall waste his prime When glory calls! I only hither came To tell of our disaster and return With our new levies, ere to-morrow's dawn.— But thou, as thou reverest thy noble race Thy safety or thy dignity, avoid Evil communication, for it leads To misery, shame and ruin!— Phan. Who art thou That dar'st prescribe to him?—art thou the head Of all the name? is he not fit to chase His friendships and his enmities? Ach. No more! Zalmon! lead on, we'll instantly return [To Phanuel. [Exit Achan and Zalmon. Phan. I was too warm!—'twere better I had sooth'd This Zalmon's pride of blood, for I have means To strike a deadly blow, without a threat— —An injury is easier to be borne Than broad avow'd contempt, scorn and desiance Of us, weak, reptile slaves to do our worst!— And this shall Zalmon feel! and Achan too His kinsman, will I make my tool, my drudge The missive thunder in this prompt right hand To bear my vengeance home, if by his means I am detained here. I will not trust To the precarious fortunes of the field Alone,—proud Lord! altho' thy pulse beats high With Judah's richest blood, I'll find the means To lower its tone a pitch, and on thy cheek Produce another tint.—But why so soon Returns my brave compeer? Enter ACHAN. Ach. Death to my hopes!— This other blow, like lightning's nimble stroke That withers the strong hand, in act to strike And mocks the threat'ning of the lifted spear Has laid our labour'd plans for ever low! Phan. What can have happen'd since to shake thee thus? Ach. The lot is cast,—and I that lately stood Like a fair tree on Tabor's flowring side With all my boughs full summ'd, and spreading wide Am left a blasted trunk! Phan. Be more thyself,—this passion may betray Thy secret purpose,—in this dreadful eve Each ear is open, and each ghastly eye Is on the watch, to scrutinize the Fates Attendant on to-morrow's dawn! Ach. Alas! Before to-morrow's dawn, my gallant friends Devoted to my service, even but now So prompt for me to tread the savage waste Or hoist the dubious sail on unknown seas (Where never Israelite embark'd), are doom'd Without remission, or reprieve, to try The fatal pass, where late our brethren fell! There all the Gods that seem'd but now subdued Rally in gloomy legions and return That panic thro' our files, which Canaan's sons Thro' all their trembling borders felt so late!— Phan. Was it the General's order? did he seem To wear the changing look of dark surmise? Did he select them for the dangerous post With lurking malice, hid in seeming praise? Ach. No—on my soul! the noble veteran seem'd So wrapt in holy fear, and bent with grief For public honour lost, and heavenly wrath, (Altho' the cause was hid) that I'm assur'd He nothing doubts of me! the sacred lots Before my faltering foot the entrance crost Had mark'd them for the tomb! Phan. Be not dismay'd Again, your superstitious fear, so late With labour overcome, and argued down With pain, begins to cloud the sovereign light Of Reason, and of nature! this defeat Shows the great power (if any power there be That rules those Israelites) or feeble grown Or fickle; why should else those favour'd bands Who late, (like tygers, o'er the ruin'd fold) Sprung o'er yon city's prostrate walls and slew Matrons, and babes, and warriours, all confus'd, Now fly, like driven deer, before a foe Less numerous and less warlike? is it thus They take possession of the promis'd land Is it with their dead bodies? what they gain'd By magic, or by chance, is lost! no more The elements, or Nature's secret powers Seem to fight for them! Ponder this, my friend! And be thine own right hand thy God, thy bands May yet return in triumph, or if not, The secret means are thine, and thine alone To levy others in their room; thy name Is not enroll'd, and Jericho has spoils Which none besides presume to touch!— Ach. My name Is not enroll'd, and does not that involve The semblance of some mystic meaning?— Phan. What?— Now I that boast not of supernal light No heavenly-gifted prophet, can perceive The workings of thy mind! thou thinkest the doom Of Heaven is pointed full at thee! that first It strikes thy friend with monitory blow To thee: Thus many, by their conscience rid And gull'd by priestly art, are led to tell The secrets of their souls, which else had slept In peace, and: Hence, bold resolution's hue “Is sicklied o'er by the pale cast of thought.”— Those sudden, strange vicissitudes are calls On manly perseverance! Ach. Be it so! But manly perseverance, without means. Will find it hard, if not impossible To gain her ends by solitary strength! Phan. The star of evening to the deeper shade Of night has scarcely yet resign'd the sky; Behind yon palms she sets: the warning trump Proclaims the second watch, the silent hour Of gloom is often known to usher in Desponding thoughts, without the needless aid Of dark suggestion: Try this other band They too belong to Judah's tribe, to thee In blood ally'd, they too could aid thy flight And aid thy love: Our late misfortune throws Ominous conjecture on the sacred cause— Your machinations sooner will prevail Usher'd by gloomy discontent: it gives An instant entrance to the dangerous thought. Ach. Besides what Mammon's glittering bribe may gain And what the restless love of change, among Those fiery spirits, who disdain the lot Of present things: tho' Eden showr'd around Her vegetable gold, with manna mixt, Still would they pant to climb the tow'ring hills That bound their view, to trace the burning sands Or plow, with ventrous keel, the wave unknown— Be these thy province, thy prompt eloquence That speaks a daring soul, unsated still With things possest, by instant alchymy Of mind, transmutes them to that essence pure That suits our purpose, while less ductile souls Touch'd by the gleaming rays of unsunn'd ore Shall find their metal flow: away! away!— Our centries are reliev'd! see! how they march Reluctant to the dangerous post!—their look Frowns mutiny, and shews, in dark presage Revolt, at least desertion! either chance To us is most propitious! part we here And to our different charge! our post we know Remember, midnight finds us at my tent! End of the First Act. ACT II. [Scene I.] Scene.—Another part of the Camp near the Tabernacle. Enter PHANUEL. Phanuel Oh that I were some God, to form anew Those sons of earth, and in their lifeless frames Some spirit to infuse! those new come guards That sled before the feeble sons of Ai Fled, tho' they thought that some supernal power Marshall'd their troops to battle, now refuse To leave their post, tho' mild persuasion sooth'd Their souls, and more persuasive gold allur'd!— What recent charm has fix'd the cowards feet So nimble in the flight, but now, when fast They fled before Perizzim's scythed cars!— It cannot be religious dread, for that: Had fixt their phalanx, firmer than the walls Of Jericho against the tide of war: Whate'er it be, I leave them to their fate Till earth to earth they grow, or turn'd to stone Stand like the monumental matron, chang'd To rock, by sad Gomorrah's fumy lake As fable tells! Altho' in distant hints Of dubious import I explor'd their souls (To keep from danger clear, lest any dar'd Accuse me) still, I found them cold, quite cold!— Be they accurst! but Achan must be steel'd To suit my purpose, lest he also swerve, Yet I have nearly from his bosom chac'd The pious leaven, from his nurse imbib'd And by the crafty Levite fed.—He now Is the sole anchor of my sinking hopes By love and strong ambition sway'd by turns He plies with easy bend to either breeze— Yet he and Zalmon are alike my foes Hated alike, alike they thwart my views Zalmon may fall in fight! if he returns Achan and he are seeming friends. But soon The brittle bond of amity shall melt Before Suspicion's breath! that task be mine— But see the lover comes! what says my friend? Phan. to Ach. Hast thou prevail'd? Ach. I durst not press my suit, But with due caution, and with solemn oaths Enjoining secrecy: some to my views Gave prompt admittance, some are doubtful still— The bond of blood among their families Gave easy entrance, but I dreaded yet To try their Chief, altho' by blood ally'd He's a fanatic, full of holy zeal!— Phan. We can subsist without him, could we gain But half his band to second our attempt And bear your double treasure, where the name Of Israel ne'er was heard! Ach. This day's defeat Would fix a party ours, nor need we doubt But flush'd with victory, the Canaanite Will follow his first blow, and heap the field With larger slaughter, Zalmon too may fall!— Phan. If not, I have a charm for this hot youth That soon will come like winter's frory breath And lay his blooming honours low: But see Where young Amaziah comes with looks of dread. Ach. O my presaging soul! my friends are fall'n! SCENE II. AMAZIAH, PHANUEL, ACHAN, Ama. Too true thy sad conjecture! I alone Survive to bring the news! of all thy band Not one is left besides! the hand of heaven Or chance, or fate, with cruel scrutiny Call'd them from every rank! they fell the first Then oh! what slaughter follow'd! Ach. How didst thou Thyself escape? Ama. I bear my death along!— One of gigantic bulk, unseen before In all Perizzim's armies, fell'd our van With oft repeated blows, and rushing in With gory lance, like some commission'd fiend Twice twelve, the boldest of thy friends dispatch'd To other worlds, I would have shunn'd the pest And wheel'd amid the scattering war in vain— He reach'd me, and his flying spear transfixt My shoulder as thou seest, “yet live,” he cry'd “Live till thou findst thy friends disperst, and tell “What thou hast seen,” whate'er his words might mean My message is deliver'd, and the load Of life I here resign!— [Dies. Ach. Where will this fearful judgment stop at last? Phan. Again this aguish sit! come! be a man Why stand you thus amaz'd? now is the time Or never, to impell the tardy fates, And bid them favour thee, or dash thy hopes For ever! Fortune sends a second chance To shake the faith of yon desponding train That guard the quarter where the lovely maid Resides: This double overthrow will turn The scale for us!—our tongue-ty'd eloquence May now speak boldly, and before the sun Bid them consult their safety, quit the camp The Heaven-detested camp, and seek by flight Their safety, ere the thunderbolt descends, Already forg'd in yonder sanguine gloom That frowns above!— Ach. Would Heaven! before those lips Were clos'd I had enquir'd if Zalmon lives.— Phan. No matter, if he lives, he lives to us His life, or death, are equal to our views! Let us retire!—I see a hated foe Approach! and see the General! his rent robes And reverend locks besprent with dust, declare The conflict of his soul! [Exeunt SCENE IV. JOSHUA, PHINEAS, Josh. 'Tis all in vain—the spirit of revolt Is spread so wide, our efforts to subdue The monster, but inflames its deadly rage The more! Oh!—had it pleas'd our gracious Lord Yet e'er I past yon self-dividing flood To call me hence! Phin. Think what the mighty son Of Amram Moses. suffer'd by their senseless broils Before he reach'd our borders! Josh. Amram's son? Oh my beloved master! lost, alas To me and Israel, soft, persuasive, mild Thou, only thou couldst bid the storm subside! Thy word like oil, could lay the turbid wave! But thou wastnever hemm'd, (as I am now) By hostile nations, and domestic rage At once! Phin. Say, does this poor, desponding plaint Become the soldier of his God? the King Of yonder hostile walls, who bends before The shrine of Baalim, to a chizeled stone (By each imperial lust, in turn enchain'd) Could tell, that stern Adversity's dark hour Distinguishes the man, from him that wears Only the semblance! yet the spreading plague Is partial only! Josh. In our chosen bands It rages uncontroll'd, ev'n Judah's sons Forget their sovereign hopes! Phin. To question Heaven And his mysterious ways, becomes us not.— Josh. True, generous Levite! thy example shews Alluding to his destruction of the Israelites who worshipped Peor. See Num. ch. 25. v. 7, 8. That action, not complaint, at such an hour As this, becomes the man whose fervent zeal Flames in the cause of Heaven! Let but thy word Sanction our daring, and we draw the sword, Lay waste yon seminary of revolt And hew away yon gangren'd limb, which spreads Infection to our vitals! Phin. Let it spread!— The moment calls not for the sword, nor lance The rampart, nor the palisaded mound To fence our threat'ned lives! but holy calm And resignation to whate'er the will Of heaven awards! Josh. And shall we idly stand And see our foes o'erwhelm us? Phin. Heaven best knows How to protect his own, whome'er he dooms To join the general ruin!—leave to heaven The method and the means! the loudest wind That shakes proud Lebanon, and bids his groves Bow their aerial heads, and kiss the soil Tho' seemingly without a rein it scours The fields of Æther, and by sea and land Ravages uncontroll'd, yet knows its bounds!— Josh. And am not I the minister of Heaven And can I dread discomsiture? I go— I cannot tamely bear to wield a sword And see those rebels to their God, at large Revel unchastis'd!— Phin. Go!—but if you do You perish in your rashness!—yet be calm!— Perhaps a few short moments may produce The crisis; then if heaven commands thine arm To lift the sure-destroying sword! obey!— If not—presume not thou to snatch the rod And balance from his hand, who best can turn The course of things to punish or reward As he decrees: our weapons now are prayers To Heaven preferr'd, with unpolluted hands! Josh. Thy pardon, reverend Phineas! thou and Heaven Forgive my rash and hasty zeal! Phin. May Heaven Forgive thee, and prepare thee yet to bear New insults still with calmness! let thy blood Preserve its temper'd pulse, thine eye forget To flame resentment, when thou seest the foe Even in this holy ground, invade our right And claim the execution of our laws From you, from us, the delegates of Heaven! Even at those sacred doors—The contest then (Remember this)—is Heaven's, and Heaven's alone! —The wonted sacrifice our presence calls Dread not the insulting Gentiles! nearer cares Claim our attention now, to guard at home.— [Exeunt. Re-enter ACHAN and PHANUEL. Phan. The General and the Priest are gone at last!— Methought the veteran seem'd to menace high But crafty Phineas sooth'd him!—This portends Bright hopes to us, the factious spirit spreads Beyond our utmost hopes, my friend!—couldst thou Have thought, our cautious arts, essay'd with fear So soon would spring to such a noble head As makes the delegate of Moses fear And to the tabernacles holy fence Retire for safety? But to other thoughts The crisis calls us!—the suspended war Sleeps, till the cause of our defeat be found!— Zalmon returns, and to the charge succeeds Perhaps, of those prepared bands, which thou Hadst led to different triumphs—but for him We have provided!— Achan. [Seemingly disturbed.] In another spot Than this, I rather would complete my schemes! Phan. Falter not now! but think, the bounds are past, And it is much too late to dream of flight!— Steel thy weak spirit! think of Zalmon's fate And thine, this moment is the balance weigh'd!— —To-morrow, if thou fail'st to-night, arrives With tardy disappointment in its train Perhaps detection. Think, thy secret now Rests in too many hands, to be conceal'd Much longer! think of love, of Zidon think Of empire and of glory!—spread around The fault on others, if thou meanst thyself To 'scape!—the shrine discloses! haste and pay Thy adorations, nor neglect the time Thine own petitions to prefer—adieu! I must not here be seen, a proselyte Claims not admittance to your holy rites Till the due season! [Exit. Achan. Phan. Now is my time, let me escape away And shun the tempest, gathering at my heels!— Scene opens, and discovers the outer Court of the Tabernacle. JOSHUA, ACHAN, crowd of ISRAELITES at Prayer. Achan aside. I too must join the suppliants, lest I seem To scorn their orisons and cause a doubt Of my deep purpose! But for what to pray I know not, nor what demon to address, One seems this hour to rule, another soon Usurps the sky, and turns the wavering scale Of destiny at pleasure,—thou! whoe'er That favourest amorous thefts, and lend'st the veil Of darkness to their flight, oh seize awhile The sceptre in this anarchy of things And lead us to the destin'd port, beyond The search and vengeance of our foes! oh save The lovely maid who rules this throbbing heart! From haughty Zalmon save her! oh! remove That jealous rival's eye from the strict watch To night, and ever may her solemn shade With welcome shrowd thy amorous thefts conceal! To them PHINEAS. Suspend your orisons awhile, for Heaven Yet frowns upon us, nor vouchsafes the sign Of bland acceptance to our prayers? the cause That bars the gate of mercy, is not known— But not by radiant Urim, nor by dreams Does he yet condescend to speak his will The slow descending glory, The Shekinah or Divine Presence. which so oft Sate on our sacred roof, distinguished far In dazzling radiance reaching to the sky Like the proud pillars that adorn the courts Of empyrean splendour, long has ceas'd To pierce yon cloudy cope, and vest at large Our tall pavilions, and the peopled walks (That cross the camp) in glory! Josh. Is there aught Committed, or neglected, to incense Our sovereign ruler? Phin. That is only known To Israel's God, but yonder fields of Ai Drench'd by the noblest blood of Jacob, tell Too plain, his kindled wrath! Josh. Is there no means To deprecate his rage? Phin. Contagion lurks Somewhere among us, or our prayers were heard, But in this vast assembly, is there one Whose eye sagacious, or whose guiding hand Can teach us how to trace the lurking pest And drag it into day? On him we call Let him stand boldly forth and save the tribes From the infliction of another blow More dreadful than the past.— Achan. [Aside.] Be firm, my soul! Phin. Nay, if the guilty man be here, I dare Pronounce in Heaven's dread name, his pardon seal'd If by confession he atones his crimes. Achan aside. Vengeance and Love assist me! or I'm lost —Ye soul-subduing powers of eloquence My flattering organs aid! To them. Behold the man Who, unpresuming on the sacred gift Of prophecy or prescience, but impell'd By public love alone, with suppliant voice Prays your indulgence, while his lips disclose Things he can prove, and to your wisdom leaves The just conclusion thence to be inferr'd! Phin. Speak out, and boldly! Josh. Thou hast nought to fear I know thee sage and noble! Achan's name Forbids us to expect a futile charge Or feebly grounded! Ach. Joshua! thy support Is kind, and comes in season, for my voice (Never till now in such unwelcome task Employ'd) must publish names—ah much endear'd To me, to all, by deeds of genuine worth, And more, by lineal honours!—Would to Heaven Beneath yon fatal rampires my pale corse Had fall'n, before to my sad lot it fell To trumpet forth a friend's disgrace, before This presence, but your late tremendous charge And this august assembly conjure down All selfish passions, every partial thought, (Tho' for my friend), and I am Israel's all!— Avaunt! ye private sympathies! ye charms Ye social ties of single soul to soul!— Avaunt! there is no pulse in this sad frame But for the public beats. Josh. He speaks, as Heaven Had now inspir'd him! Phineas! now, at last, Expect an answer to your prayers! O now No more the haughty Canaanite shall line The pass, and intercept with double death Our sinking legions! Phin. Yet suppress thy zeal!— See his lips labour, and his frame, convuls'd Beneath the deadly secret seem to sink!— I fear some much belov'd, much honour'd name Will pass those lips, and some great chieftain's doom Will send the loud lament along your lines In oft repeated sorrow! Ach. Thou hast guess'd O reverend Priest! aright! but be no blame To his accuser! would my lips were clos'd In Death's eternal trance, e'er I were forc'd To name the name of Zalmon, but in terms Due to my friendship, and his matchless worth For matchless worth is his! But oh! I fear His partial passion for a lovely maid Among our captives, whom his thoughtless love Designs to wed, and mix his sacred line With Gentiles, and with slaves, draws down this plague. Phin. Before this tribunal none is condemn'd Unheard, let Zalmon strait be call'd, and thou Achan! prepare thee to support thy charge With clearest circumstance, before the face Of Israel and her God, assembled here! Josh. Go, heralds! and assemble here in haste By sound of trump the universal name Of Israel by their tribes and families To tend this awful trial and to learn By terrible example how to keep With stricter care, their theocratic law! Phin. Woe to the guilty, for behold! above, The clouds, in gloomy files, around the point Of noon, diverge, and yonder deep serene Shews the descending pomp of them, who tend The sovereign lamp of truth! her piercing beam Shall soon dispel the dim Tartarean fogs Of falsehood from the mind! her holy dawn. Shall lay the secret regions of the soul In empyrean lights unwelcome day! Touch'd by that beam, the lurking pest, tho' now It 'scape the keenest sight, shall soon disclose Its horrible dimensions!—Sound the trump!— Raise the broad ensign of Jehovah high! Let every soul appear, who draws his life From Jacob's hallowed stem, for all must pass In long review before the judging eye And clear their innocence, or shew the cause Why Israel's sons, whom nature's subject powers Obey, are baffled by their Gentile foes! [Exeunt, Phineas and Joshua go into the Temple. Scene.—Another part of the Camp. Zal. And can this visitation point at me? My love, unsanction'd by the seal of Heaven Perhaps, has laid the pride of Israel low!— I love thee, Rahab! in this faithful breast Thy matchless form, thy matchless merit stamps Thy image, never by the hand of Time Or Fortune, to be spoil'd! Thy chosen youth Thy Abdon, thou beheld'st to death devote, And hadst the power to change our blood for his!— But oh! thy nobleness of mind, thy faith In Heaven, disdain'd the purchase of his life By persidy, by breach of sacred trust— Our lives were in thy hands! upon thy word Our breath depended! thou! unequall'd maid! Couldst have redeem'd a husband and a sire By giving us to Fate!—thy nuptial hand Would dignify the most ennobled name Among our most distinguished tribes—and I— Shall I resign the treasure?—who besides Can urge a claim so powerful? To secure The blessing mine, from Judah's regal tribe (To whom the sceptre is by promise given) I draw my lineal blood, and justly claim Her eldest honours.—Let me muse a while!— Is there no other duty to oppose The calls of Passion?—yes—these very ties Of blood—and all the honours of my race All! all united, urge their general plea And tell me that I live not to myself But to my country, to my lineal claims And to the honours of my regal stem! High are the promises to Judah given Of mystic import: from his root shall rise A name by prophets, and by priest proclaim'd The first on earth, the favour'd of the skies! Perhaps to spring from me!—and shall I take An alien to my bed? tho' eminent In beauty, and with mental charms endow'd Above the daughters of our tribes?—perhaps Heaven favours not this union! Heaven forbid! That I should match against thy sovereign will! That my example should encourage more To cull their spouses from the race accurst Whom Heaven pursues with vengeance! tho' this maid Be faultless, and beholds her people's crimes With just abhorrence, others less reserv'd Who chuse their loves, at random, by the look Allur'd, might think their impious choice, by mine Amply excus'd; and 'mongst our martial tribes Disseminate the vile contagion round Of idol worship, and her odious train Of vile pollutions from their spouses learn'd— —Israel might mourn, for many a luckless day The bane of my alliance! this deserves My serious thoughts: the general interdict Forbade our tribes to touch the spoils accurst Of conquer'd Jericho! perhaps that word Included all, the captives and the stores Alike! and shall I dare, with impious step To rush beyond the bounds prescrib'd by Heaven With awful prohibition? what transferr'd Those forfeit regions, from their ancient Lords To us, but Canaan's crimes? they stood subdued By Vice, before the delegated sword Of Israel, thinn'd their legions, and if we Their victors, learn not first to rule at home Learn not self-conquest, and to square our wills To Heavens' behest; the very land, incenst Will sink beneath us, and o'erwhelm our hopes As yon fall'n towers can witness! Heaven be prais'd I never yet my passion to the fair Explain'd in words, she well indeed could guess By my demeanour, that my heart was her's: But—lately when a secret hour I stole To visit the fair Canaanite, I found The lustre of her eye was lost, her look Bore symptoms of dejection, deeper far Than for her country, even for Abdon's fate She shew'd before! That Achan loves her, by undoubted signs To me is clear, and Achan has a form,— —Has merit to secure the coyest heart And kindle sires beneath the coldest ice Of saintly chastity. If he has wak'd A mutual flame, perhaps, th'enamour'd pair Fear to confess their passion, left I urge My prouder claim, and bid the general voice Swell the demand with popular applause And lineal honours, to devote the maid To me!—I scorn the thought—yet must I lose Sotamely this distinguished prize?—resign My heart, to heal a lovesick warriour's sighs! —It is a dreadful conflict—but the more Becoming Zalmon!—then, this instant hour While my resolves are warm, while Glory calls To her I dedicate! and if my prayers Can learn that Achan rules her heart, this voice —May it be never tun'd to sing thy praise Glory of Israel! may this recreant hand No longer wield thy delegated sword Against thy rebels! If I fail to cure Her sorrows and my friend's—that friend shall find In me a zealous advocate, beyond His hope, for less would misbecome the name And more than this, becomes the man, whose race Is deem'd to bless our tribes in years to come! [Exit. End of the Second Act. ACT III. SCENE I. The Court of the Tabernacle, the Glory descending over it. JOSHUA, PHINEAS, ZALMON, ACHAN, ISRAELITES, Assembled by their Tribes. Phin. A moment yet by Providence is given (Before the fount of mercy, closing fast Bids kindling Vengeanee walk her dreadful round) For penitence to urge her latest plea And bathe her crimes in no successless tears!— —Arrest the moment, e'er it fleets away Ye who are conscious of a crime!—to you Achan! I first apply! It much concerns Him, who presumes to taint a brother's fame Before this dread tribunal, to explore With cautious eye, the structure of his charge Its basis and its strength, for, if a flaw Be found, tho' previous to a single ray Of scrutiny, the swift pervading flame Shall crumble it to nothing Zalmon! thou 'Gainst whom his allegation is gone forth Must think that no permission yet is given For Israel's sons, to tye the nuptial bond With Gentiles, and with strangers, and if aught Of worldly views, or passion prompts your mind On Heaven's dread silence to presume, and frame Laws for your conduct, let the present hour (If thine own soul arraigns thee) be employ'd As suits thy former character and worth.— Ach. If I be deem'd.— Phin. —No vindication now!— The time allows not that!—I must retire— And find what means the awful name appoints Whether by lot, or oracle to shew The secret pest that sapps our holy strength And lay our glories low! [Exit into the Tabernacle. Zal. Achan! my friends!— Say why is this? is Zalmon to be call'd Hither without accuser? Josh. No impatience In look or thought this sacred presence taint!— The accuser stands before thee!—thou prepare For thy defence, but be all passion far And all complaint! tho' much, I must confess, Thy fervour shews like innocence, and well I know thy worth, it yet becomes not me Thus to prejudge thy cause! In other hands Thy doom or absolution rests! Zal. To me All this is wonderful!—and Achan too My bosom friend! who shar'd my inmost soul He my accuser! He!—Oh sacred Faith!— But I am more than calm, I'm confident That yon dread scrutinizing eye will shew What I have been to him, and what to Heaven! To them from the TABERNACLE. Phin. Summon the heads of Israel! be the lots Twice six, in equal number to our tribes— Soon like a tainted sheep, whose breath infects The flock, the tribe condemn'd shall stand aloof An alien from its brethren, till the hand Of Heaven explores its families around And sists them man by man.— [The lots are cast. —Aboliah! name the lot. Abol. —The tribe of Judah— Ach. [Aside.] Yet be firm my heart.— Josh. Aside. O Zalmon! Zalmon! have I liv'd to see Thy blooming honours, matchless in the field So tainted? Oh my fall'n, degenerate friend! Thy lapse has loos'd the strictest tyes that bind Society! for who will trust the man Who bears the most conspicuous signs of worth!— —Pronounce him hypocrite!—and him whose faith Depends upon his merit, simple, weak, And credulous as infancy!— Phin. to him. No more!— This passion well befits thee!—but the rites Are interrupted!—fling the counted lots Into the urn, and be the sacred sum Equal in number to the reverend heads Of families in Judah!— [The lots again are cast. —What appears? Abol. The name of Zerah. Zal. Now to Heaven be praise! The stem of Phares and his sons are free! Josh. Zalmon! I joy to see thee thus absolv'd!— But mourn to think thy tribe must still supply The guilty head! Ach. [In great agitation] One word before the lots Proceed! Phin. The time of recollection's past! The scrutiny must now proceed! Ach. I must And will be heard!—If you would shun the blame Of management! of fraud! of partial care For Zalmon's safety, bid your slave of state Your ready implement, whose dext'rous hands Obsequious to your eye, the lots dispose By the dark intimations of your will— Bid him resign to more impartial care To some unbyas'd sage, by all the tribes In general vote elected, else the blood Of him who falls be on your head! Phin. Be it as you demand! assembled tribes If ye object not, Achan's reverend sire Shall match the lots to Zerah's families, A lot for every household, who derive Their blood from Judah's younger line. But ye Speak your denial or assent at once! All. Let Zabdi be the man!—our choice is Zabdi! Phin. Achan, we wait alone for thy assent! Dost thou object to him? Ach. I own, with joy Thy justice and submit [aside] if Phanuel's care Have mov'd the treasures, yet I may escape Detection and pursue his flight! Phin. Thy faith And zeal, O reverend Zabdi! all the tribes Acknowledge, thou dispose the sacred lots By Zerah's families, and shake the urn! [Lots cast. Phin. Joshua looking at the Lots. Whose lot emerges? The searching eye of Heaven!—'tis Zabdi's name! O spare the reverend sire a further test!— Behold his agony! Phin. He must proceed! No retractation now!—he must proceed— And, with a soldier's fortitude, sustain The final tryal! Josh. How the awful doom Delays, in dreadful circuit hovering wide As the high soaring bird of prey, that views A timorous flock of village fowl beneath Contracts in narrower space, with deathful aim His wide aereal range, in short'ned flight, Till on the destin'd bird, with shadowy plume At once he settles, and his sanguine beak The screaming victim rends! the sacred lot Thus circles round the tribe; dispensing dread Thro' all her quaking families it moves Till fixt at last, it marks the menac'd head And holds it high, a monument of wrath A warning to the nations! [Lots cast again. [Joshua examines the Lots. Zabdi—oh Unhappy sire, O Phineas! mark the name Of Achan!

And, when he found the noble Zalmon freed By heavenly sentence, dar'd to six on us The taint of prejudice, and partial views Unmerited as vile! Had we accus'd This man by usual process, had we call'd The witness to his guilt, his frontless pride Had tax'd the spotless tribunal of Heaven With foul injustice, or presum'd to sind In the detector's hand, th'unseemly stain Of bribes, suborning perjury! But now His pleas are spent, he scorn'd the soothing voice Of mercy when it call'd, he madly dar'd To hurl defiance 'gainst the lifted hand Of boundless wrath incenst, he deem'd the eye Of dread Omniscience clos'd, his justice warp'd By favour, and the sanction of his laws His truth, and his unchangeable decrees The sport of fickle chance, absorb'd and lost In the blind waste of chaos and old night!— Heaven, to confute his impious pleas at once Made the sad father's hand, (as you have seen) The instrument to doom the son! the sire Deserves our pity, but the son has clos'd The gates of mercy on himself! Josh. Yet say Unhappy youth! hast thou presum'd to touch The interdicted spoils?—confess your crimes Make that atonement to the injur'd state! And as your sin disgrac'd our holy cause Let your unfeign'd acknowledgment declare High Heaven's omniscience, and his justice prov'd On thee! so shall thy fault, thus far aton'd Contribute to his glory, and our good By thy example! Ach. Deep within my tent The treasures lie! Josh. Aboliah! go and search! Zab. Oh Joshua! may this fault'ring tongue presume To plead for pity! see these hoary hairs! Think on the battles we have fought together! The weary leagues of yonder burning wild We travel'd o'er, and spare the main support Of my declining age! He has confess'd!— —The glory of our God by him remains Unsullied! his omniscience unimpeach'd!— Let him survive, altho' he live with shame! Phin. Patience old man! he has not yet confess'd The motives to his crime!—say hapless youth What led thee to this errour? Ach. Spare my pain!— 'Twas love of your fair captive! Josh. How could love (A generous passion) to ignoble deeds Impell a son of Judah? Ach. Tho' I lov'd I yet despair'd of favour! then the sense Of my demerit and my rival's worth Led me to try what riches might avail. I meant (and I had brib'd a trusty band To aid my purpose) to have borne her hence. Josh. Whither? Ach. To Zidon. Josh. How didst thou expect For her or thee, a refuge with the race Who live in darkness and the shades of death To every lust enslav'd? Hadst thou resolv'd The God of Israel to renounce, and live A Gentile! an apostate! say was this Thy final hope? Ach. I know not where my crimes Had led me! Phanuel too with soothing art Fed high my hopes of honours from his state And dignities at Zidon, by my wealth Procur'd, but far beyond my merit! Josh. Call That Phanuel hither!— Enter ABOLIAH. Abol. He is fled, my Lord!— This as I came, I learn'd; some slaves with him Were seen departing. In the tent we found The cavern open'd, and the stores purloin'd All but these talents, and this sumptuous bale Of Babylonian texture, as it seems!— Achan starts. Then Phanuel has betray'd me!—oh the pangs Of falsehood found beneath a friendly form! Zal. I would not pain thee!—yet with deep regret I mourn to think of Passion's boundless power, That love which led thee to suspicions foul Of me, thy natural friend! Hadst thou but known And trusted me, this hour of guilt and shame Had never been your lot! Ach. Didst thou not love The beauteous Rahab? did I not behold Thy passion sparkle in thine eyes, when first Their beams met her's? Oh Zalmon! could I stand (I know myself and thee) say could I stand A moment's competition? wouldst thou give. Such treasure to thy friend? and should the friend Subdue the lover, could I be the man That had deserv'd her of thee, could the maid Who once had lifted her aspiring mind To be ally'd to Zalmon, look on me?— Zal. Whatever was, or might have been, shall now For ever in oblivion lie! 'Twas love To her, I know, that woke thy seeming hate To me, as such thy failing I forgive, As freely as I hope to be forgiven At Mercy's throne! To Phineas and Joshua. If I have aught deserv'd In council, or in arms, if Judah's tribe Has any claim on Israel, all her fires Shall join with this unhappy reverend man To claim compassion for this sentenc'd youth Thro' weakness fall'n, and by a Gentile's art Beguil'd! Zab. Now may that heaven whom thou aspirst In deeds of mercy and long-suffering love Thus to resemble, be thy great reward Thou noble youth!— Phin. Young man! it cannot be! Zabdi! I pity thee! but Heaven requires A dread example in this crisis given To keep your loyalty to Heaven's high power Unflaw'd and stedfast, and to steel our troops For the ensuing conflict! if that God We reverence, deigns to take in full account For all his crimes, the transitory pangs Of death, be satisfied!— Ach. I do not wish For life!—for what is life, with lasting shame? I hate to view the light, the brand of theft Stampt by each eye and burning in my front As I should walk the camp! I but implore One moment of indulgence, while I ask My noble friend, (alas too lately known) A single question!—Zalmon! from your words (Tho' dark of import) on my soul there seem'd To dawn a prospect, of a deed of friendship Which from your innate modesty you meant To bury in oblivion! Zal. Ask to know No more, the knowledge would but pain thee now! Ach. Oh! no! my friend! whate'er would cheapen life Would be most welcome now! whate'er would serve To wean me from the world, which as I gaze Seems fleeting from me, whatsoe'er would make My penitence more poignant and severe, Whate'er would point the salutary pang That stings the torpid mind to better life A life of virtue—were most welcome now!— Nor Zalmon! be a niggard of the boon!— Give the sharp medicine! tho' it pierce the heart! It yet may cure the soul, and endless time May thank thee, in the worlds beyond the sun! Zal. Thy eloquence has mov'd me—hapless youth! Sad victim of temerity! and lost By thy despondence lost!—by diffidence In me! thou mightest have better known thy friend!— But 'tis too late to blame!—thou wouldst not own Thy love to me; I doubted first, and soon By accident I found it! Tho' my flame For Rahab, burn'd with tenfold fervour, still I doubted Heaven's concurrence, and withheld My passion with strong rein, I saw her sad And thee desponding, I suspected thence A secret, hopeless flame had touch'd your hearts With mutual fervour, and I meant (just Heaven! Would I had made my purpose known to thee!) I meant, with all my care to scrutinize The lovely strangers heart, and, if I found Thy image there, the influence I had us'd To draw the secret thence, had made her own Her passion! then to thee had I disclos'd The glad discovery, and resign'd my claim, Nay I have reason (but alas—why tell The cruel secret now) to think her heart Was thine! But I have said too much! forgive Thy thoughtless friend—thy colour comes and goes! O Achan, how thine eyeballs glare! thy limbs Speak thy mind's torture!—they are all convuls'd What shakes thee thus? what speechless agony? Achan, after a long pause. No—I have found my speech! and would to Heaven My sight were gone! eternal darkness, hide Oh hide me from his sight! an injur'd friend! His eyes are blasting!—cover me ye hills! Pile rocks on rocks upon me! hurl me down To central darkness, where no dawning star May wake my pangs, nor light upbraid me more! I plann'd his ruin, while he meant me life And happiness! yet do I live to look Upon him?— Zal. Why this agony? thy friend Forgives thee, and may Heaven forgive thee too! Ach. Still deeper torment of remorse! begone! Avaunt! thy sight is wounding! that mild look Harrows my soul like scorpions stings!—away! Ye walls of Jericho! would I had fall'n Beneath thy thund'ring ruins! lead me hence Conduct me to my fate!— Lest this right hand, the direful instrument Of black despair, another lesson learn From her dire lips, and with determin'd rage Cut short my being! Phin. Lead him to my tent Till we assuage this tumult of his soul Now far,—oh far unfit to meet his God (In this wild frenzy)! as a victim due To justice, he must fall, but potent prayers And Heaven's blest influence must expel the fiend That labours for his ruin! lead him hence!

Tirzah. Bathsheba. Scene—Jerusalem. ACT I. [SCENE I.] SCENE.—A street in Jerusalem—A mournful procession seen at a distance. BENAIAH and HUSHAI meeting. Ben. Welcome from Rabbah's camp!—your stay was short— I trust your mission prosper'd? Hush. Friend—all hail The success of my mission lies in clouds Till time shall draw aside the mystic veil, But, say, what means this solemn pomp? It seems Attended by half Judah! some disaster Has blank'd the face of Salem, do they bend Their march to Israel's holy shrine, to seek For aid or counsel? Ben. Nought of holy import Conducts the pomp, but sacrilege and guilt To one indeed confin'd: the crowd, are free Tho' touch'd with honest and indignant grief To find so foul a taint infect their name. Hush. Is it such guilt, as justice cannot reach? Ben. It can! Hush. What hinders then the needful stroke That lops the foul infected limb away? Ben. Now they come near!—say, canst thou recognize That reverend from that leads the mourning train? Hush. Can I believe my sight! 'Tis Nathan's self The holy man! Heavens!—how serene he looks Amid the general woe! Ben. Yet in his looks Seest thou what kindling indignation gleams At times? and how his rapid eye-beam darts Into futurity, and what a glance Of anger mixt with sorrow oft he throws. Hush. What can it mean In such a saintly bosom, long estrang'd From human passions, such disorder'd starts Such flaws, as seem to shake his aged frame, Such agony, such hear-tfelt grief, as paints His visage, seem of some mysterious themes With more than human organ to discourse! Ben. You saw him calm, but now,—he sooth'd the crowd In the most dreadful hurricane of rage That ever threaten'd change. Hush. What mov'd their wrath? Ben. The strange and frontless guilt Of Nathan's son, to whom th'indulgent sire Had given his all, and that inhuman wretch (Spite of his double sanctity, compos'd Of prophet and of father) forc'd him thence (With insult, next to outrage,) in the eye Of noon and Judah's sons, assembled round Who gaz'd with horrour on this impious deed. Hush. Why, all things seem revers'd—how bore the crowd Th'abominable fact? Ben. Their fury swell'd, And seem'd beyond the power of aught, but Heaven To sooth—when, with authoritative tone That seem'd to palsy every lifted hand And quench the sire in every sparkling eye The sire commanded, and they spar'd the son— “Go! take my farewell to the King” he said (To a young friend, that stood dejected by) “And tell him what you saw” then past along Self-sentenc'd, self-exil'd. The mourning crowd That for a benediction press around Have thus delay'd his exit. [Procession passes by,—some Israelites remain behind. Hush. This vile son Had never dar'd this outrage, but he knew The King's aversion to his reverend sire! Ben. In days of old, a prophet's mystic deeds Were often (like the nightly waving sign That leads the vaward of the coming storm) An awful harbinger of Heavenly wrath That figur'd forth disastrous days to come: Their actions speak, when words are found to fail Thus may it be once more! To any ears, but thine, I should not trust My thoughts, but this late coldness in the King To his best friends in general, make his hate To Nathan less prodigious.—How he sinks From the fraternity of angels, down To mingle with the common mass of men!— Oh what a change! since with yon reverend sage He us'd to mount beneath the morning star To Olivets calm brow, like Amram's heir There half the journey of the summer sun Beneath her hallow'd bowers abstracted sate With the rapt prophet, and with kindling eye And attitude of wonder, catch afar The strong delineations of that hand Which trac'd the pageants of the times unborn Thick rising to Imagination's glance Like atoms in the sun's unfolding beam! Oft would they traverse all the sacred hill As if that lofty range, in time to come Were meant the scene of some heroic deed Or second revelation of the law Of Heaven, like Horeb's summit: but since then Late, in the gleam of twilight, mute and sad The prophet of the alienated King Has oft been seen to wander there alone There, oft he seem'd in fixt and leaden pause To muse awhile, then, on a sudden, rapt With strong emotion and irregular glance He scann'd the green lawns, and the shady bowers As if they all seem'd conscious of the change— The very dregs of Israel feel the change And like foul vapours, by the sun exhal'd They mount in mutinous revolt, and hide The orb of majesty in dim eclipse. Ben. They feel the weight of glory, and bow down By trophies and by taxes doubly prest. Our anarchy at home, and fame abroad Are like the spasms of an expiring man Who seems to grapple with a nerve of steel Tho' Death's cold siege his lab'ring heart assails. [Shout. Hush. Now, like the fiery fever's rising rage, The people's fury threat the public weal With wild delirium and misrule.—Behold How the wide tumult fluctuates! now they shout As if some demon, in the seemly mask Of popularity had fir'd their souls. Ben. You guess aright—it is that artful fiend That, in the shape of Absalom, purloins The people's loyalty, and, in its stead With unfelt skill infuses in their veins Sedition's deadly bane.—Let us retire And mark the demagogue's perfidious art. [Retire to one side. SCENE II. ABSALOM—ISRAELITES. Abs. It must not be, my friends! my loyalty So combates with my feelings for your woes That I must fly the strong seducing charm Or deviate from the strict and narrow path That filial duty points! The royal wrath Already burns, because I dar'd to ask Some relaxation of your bonds! alas! My voice is discord in my father's ear It sounds a raven's note! some other strain More tuneable may reach the regal sense And touch the nerve of pity! They, whose spells Build up the high, invisible mound, that bars All access from the people to their King, Can seal his eyes, when the inhuman son Expells his father, and let Piety Be chac'd with scorn from Salem's sacred streets. Yet should I lift my voice at Israel's wrong How would they conjure up the deadly forms Of foul revolt, and charge me with the crime Of most unnatural treason? Let this plead Your friend's excuse, who must in silence mourn But dare not vent his grief in aught but tears Farewell my friends! be patient, and resign'd. [Exeunt severally Absalom and Israelites. Manent HUSHAI and BENAIAH. Ben. Such is the oil that subtle Arlist pours Upon the flame, and bids it blaze the more; His secret machinations cannot still Be hid, as now; the conflagration soon (I fear) will blaze his practice to the world And show the danger, when beyond a cure. Bush. O for a man to cross the deadly spell! A friend to King and people both at once Whose worth might add a dignity, and give His words due aim and weight to reach the ear Of monarchs with effect; and touch the soul! Not like those random and uncertain shafts Of declamation, wing'd by every wind That fluttering fly, and fall without a scope.— Ben. Unless the mandate be already given To the destroying angel not to spare, I know the man could stand within the breach, Could stop th'invading pest and teach the King To ward the danger off, a man beloved By Israel, and his monarch's chosen friend! Hush. Name him! Ben. Your eyes were witness to his worth Not many days ago! Hush. Uriah! Ben. He Or none, could heal the growing malady Which else might turn a gangrene! Hush. Hope suggests That the late message of the King portends Immediate exaltation, and high trust To him—some powerful reasons could be given. Ben. True—friend!—and so I thought, when I perceiv'd No common messenger employ'd, but one Whose searching eye thro' courts and camps pervades And like a sun-beam spies the latent ill. Hush. To me such courtly language—from a friend— Ben. Pardon me—but I guess'd (tho' little skill'd Or studious in the mystic things of state To pry) that, not alone to call the friend Of David, you were sent, but to explore Whether, with fervent zeal, or lukewarm love In Israel's camp the General's name is breath'd. Hush. You know the humours of a camp, my friend! How liberal of reproach against their chief Even him that all would bleed for—but in Joab I fear that jealous and malignant spirit Still lives, that cost the friend of Saul so Abnor, assassinated by Joab. See 2 Sam. c. iii. v. 20. 27. dear. Ben. What reason have you to suspect so deep? Hush. The mandate of his monarch he receiv'd With martial dignity, but, when he learn'd The message for Uriah, o'er his cheek Past, in a twinkling, all the varying hues Of close conflicting passion, till his art Seren'd the ruffling storm; that night I stay'd, Next morn I sought the General! but I found Admittance was deny'd. Ben. To David's envoy?— This was a strain of insolence indeed! Hush. This sturdy opposition will be found Perhaps, the child of fear, a conscience gall'd With guilt, for if to rumour we may trust Under the shadow of a moonless night This great commander, like a felon, stole From his pavilion, and the trenches past.— Ben. What proof of this, besides malignant fame? Hush. His brother's doubled vigilance and care, His trumpet singly call'd the host to arms The absent General's part he well sustain'd From wing to wing he travers'd all the host And kindled up the slumb'ring war anew. Ben. Nor yet appear'd the Chief? and was it fear Or sullen indignation that withheld The General? Hush. Time his purpose may disclose; Meanwhile, conjecture dogs his lonely steps Over the burning waste to Tadmor's bounds Where those, whom late his lifted vengeance spar'd On the dry skirts of Midian, wait the sign To leave those wilds, where parching thirst abides And settle on Samaria's water'd vales Like locusts.—Others think his course is turn'd Among the tribes of Israel to foment Revolt and war. Ben. To me, this enterprize Seems foreign to his bent: is he a man On bare suspicion to forsake his post? Would he the rebels daring flag unfurl And fling his fortune in the dubious scale Of wild domestic rage, because her lord Sent for a faithful servant from the camp? It bears no semblance of his ancient art He would not plunge himself in Jordan's flood Because, in thought, he heard a lion roar? Hush. Yes—he will plunge,—but like a water snake Close vigilance must watch the passing stream For none can tell to what unhappy shore The monster first will point his crested head. —All yet is dubious, but his flight! Ben. And we, Shall we conceal those tidings from the King? 'Tis fit he knew the dangers full extent! Hush. Far, far beyond the limits of the camp (If I conjecture right) the danger spreads And much more near, than Tadmor's burning sands Or even than Jordan's bounds! Ben. Too true: alas! The democratic spirit spreads abroad, Like a proud overpeering flood it sweeps, And levels all distinction, scorns all rule, As if the waves should lift their foamy heads To dash their empress from her throne of light Whose silver wand their mighty motion sways Uriah's popularity and skill Might fix the helm of empire in his hand, And bid the menac'd barque out-ride the storm. Hush. Or, to surprize him with unwonted honours Or profit by his counsel; David brings At such a time, the Viz. Uriah. soldier from his post— But it were well if some experienc'd friend Would meet the warriour, ere he sees the King And hint some useful topics for the times Such as the smooth-tongued courtier dreads to use But which a soldier's candour might enforce And amplify with fearless eloquence. Ben. Is he arriv'd? Hush. A few short hours will see The warriour here. Ben. These moments must be us'd To counsel your brave friend, how best to serve His country and his King.—I go to find That friend who in his inmost bosom lives Who best can sire his zeal, or suage his flame. [Ex. severally. SCENE III. An apartment in the Palace of the Queen. The QUEEN, Michal, the daughter of Saul. TIRZAH. Tirz. O Princess! yet reflect! a husband's love By arts like those was never yet regain'd! Vengeance may quench the flame, if any spark Should yet survive, but ne'er can wake the fire In such a heart as his—recall thy words And bid thy messenger return! this hour, Perhaps this moment sees the spell begun That calls the fiends of discord from the deep And poisons homebred joy. Queen. Were I a slave Call'd by th'inconstant smile of royalty For a few April days of transient love Like a fond flower to bask beneath the beam, Then hang my patient head, surcharg'd with dew And patient weep the sun's departing ray Thy lessons might have weight! But I was born Of one, whose voice, by him that lords it now, Was dreaded worse than thunder! when thou seest An eagle's aiery breed the patient dove Then preach forbearance! when thou seest the drops Of autumn wash away yon lofty frame That lifts its brow to Heaven, expect my tears Will melt a stubborn heart! Tirz. Nor prayers nor tears Would I advise, but patience, and the calm Of resignation, unassuming worth, Virtues, that speak by action, and confess That more than mortal guest that dwells within That soul-subduing grace, whose cherub smiles Can reach the heart, and bid revolting love Obsequious, own your sway,—forgive my zeal If my too liberal tongue offend! but late You thought more calmly, and confess'd these arts Were not below your care, by arts like these (So well conceal'd, they seem'd no longer art) Not many moons ago you thought you saw His love returning. Queen. This augments my grief That then, from bloody wars but new return'd When calm reflection brooded o'er the past, And brought again forgotten times to view My faithfulness and zeal, when for his life (Threaten'd by angry Saul, who sent his slaves With bloody purpose) 1 Sam. c. xii. v. 12. I expos'd my own, Sav'd him from slaughter, and a crown bestow'd— This he remember'd, and methought, I saw The tender lover o'er the king prevail, And halcyon days return! when, like a blast That withers all the genial blooms of spring, This syren came, a suppliant, as it seem'd, Drest for persuasion, tho' in weeds of woe, In all the winning eloquence of tears Adorn'd. And with a pious charge, to gain A brother's pardon. So the rumour past, But all was fraudful practice, all design'd To ruin my projected schemes, and lay My tow'ring edifice of hope in dust.— I will not bear it.—By the awful name Of him, whose blood I share, his ghost shall see Ample revenge for his insulted line! Tirz. Oh yet reflect! you draw a scene of guilt With Rumour's pencil, from imagin'd wrong!— Must Israel's sacred monarch be aspers'd Because Uriah left his blooming bride, And to th'inviting couch of love, preferr'd The warrior's lonely bed. He might have stay'd— No voice imperial call'd him to the field, Till the revolving moons had brought again His nuptial day New married men were excused from military service for the first year, by the Mosaical law.. His fellow-bridegrooms all Pleaded the law, nor for the martial trump Would change the hymeneal lyre. But he Disdain'd the flowery chaplet, and put on, With pride, the warrior's plume. His spouse's prayers, Her adjurations, and her trickling tears, That heighten'd every charm, unmov'd he bore, When honour call'd. And must we then conclude That fixt aversion in her bosom grew, Because her lord preferr'd his country's call Before ignoble ease? Such merit claim'd Encrease of love. And must Bathsheba stray Down that alluring path where pleasure leads, Because Uriah chose the rigid path Where honour marshalls on her hermit train? —Not such effects from such examples flow!— Queen. The blessed sun that bids the flower expand, Matures the poisonous weed. And scorn with scorn, And hate with hate the female heart repays Oftner than tame servility, inspir'd By contumelious negligence and pride. Would heaven I could forget—but thy defence Brings to my mind the hateful circumstance Of their first meeting. At that time David had been deprived of his spouse by Saul. Then how David's heart Glow'd at her opening beauties, when he sought Her father's house, a refuge from the rage Of his pursuers! Hope inspir'd his vows— But when he learn'd Eliam's Father to Bathsheba. solemn vow Had given her to Uriah, he resign'd His love to friendship: with dissembled virtue He gave her—but to make her more his own! Tirz. Thus still suspicion clouds the noblest deeds, With her Tartarean shades! Let Reason speak, Reason will tell, that if she scorn'd her spouse, Who sought, at Honour's call, the bloody field.— She too must scorn that lover, who resign'd, At Friendship's voice her blooming virgin charms.— Reason will tell, that he, whose strenuous hand Could shut the pleasing image from his heart, At Friendship's call, would never wound the peace Of one, for whom he sacrificed his feelings!— O then my sovereign, hear thy servant's plea, Recall your mandate! trust not vague report, Nor be it ever said that she, who draws Her blood from Israel's first and mightiest king, Should seek the level of the slave, and mine Domestic peace! 'Tis nobler far to look Above such injuries! and leave to time To cure such casual wand'rings of the heart. If he have stray'd! Queen. Thinkst thou I would proceed such dreadful lengths, Without the clearest proof? Were it but casual, there indeed were hopes Of speedy reformation. But I fear, I fear! nay, I am certain. Years on years Have seen their passion grow! It ne'er can be, It gives the lie to reason, that a glance, A casual look, tho' arm'd by Heaven or Hell, With all their enginry, should fire the heart At once. Of spells and magic I have heard, But not believed. And there are men whose hearts Yield at first onset. But, 'mongst such, the name Of David numbers not. Tirz. There must be charms Of mind, as well as person, to secure Lasting esteem; unhappy is that fair, Who, trusting to th'enchantment of the eyes Alone for conquest, when th'artillery fails, Has no supply of mental charms within. Hers is a short dominion! Queen. To her charms The fair adult'ress trusts not! There are powers Whose strong assemblage keeps her in the throne Of royal favour. And, should she be cast Aside, the busy panders soon would find Another in her room! By her, they rule; She is their instrument to wind at will This royal engine to their sordid ends. And, does it not become my birth, my place, To scatter that obnoxious cloud, that damps The royal virtues? Long the sacred lamp Of Judah has burn'd dim beneath the gloom, But soon it shall revive, and justice reach The trembling victim, tho' behind the throne. A loyal few, who lov'd my father's name (Trusty and bold, all friends of antique stamp, Who mourn my degradation feel the fall Of her, that added lustre to the name Of Bethlehem's haughty lord,) shall aid my views. To David's counsels they shall find their way, And force attention to the people's prayers. The house of Saul again shall lift its head In ancient splendour, on the blasted hopes Of those, who scoff her faded fortunes now.— But, see! my faithful messenger returns; His chearful looks proclaim the deed is done, And I shall rest in peace! But thou retire. His message needs no witness. Tirz. Heaven forefend Those evils, which my sad presaging soul Sees in approach, perhaps before the sun Descends; for council now is all in vain. [Exit Tirzah. SCENE IV The QUEEN—SHIMEI. Queen. Thy countenance declares, before thy speech, The success of thy message. Shim. Yes, my queen! The deadly vapours of illicit love Have reign'd too long. But soon the wholesome gale Of great revenge shall lift its awful voice, And sweep from yon polluted palace walls The noxious brood, that long in swarms besieg'd Each avenue, and banish'd from its bounds The sons of modest merit, ancient worth, And lineal honour! Soon that upstart race, With that perfidious, bloody man, who slew Thy father's friend, shall lower their haughty crests. Queen. Follow me to my chamber—there disclose Thy tidings at full leisure, the loose tribe Of profligates and panders soon shall find Their empire at an end—convene your friends But one by one, left over-curious eyes Should mark their movements. Shim. I but stay to meet One of my confidential friends who waits My coming at this instant, and the next Shall see me, with the rest, attend thy will. [Exit Queen. Shim. alone. O sacred house of Benjamin! again Thou shalt resume the sceptre, or at least Its lineal honours share.—Alas! with them The old renown of Jacob sinks in night Our glory is departed! Freedom fell With thee, or what of freedom still remain'd And bloody conquest now, and martial law And costly pomp, by parasites ador'd Succeed the rustic majesty of Saul Who mingled with the people, nor disdain'd To lead their legions, or in peace partake Their humble joys—but see! my trusty friend Approaches to my wish—Abdon—all hail. SHIMEI—ABDON. Shim. The moment comes, when they, who shed the blood Of Abner, thy lamented friend shall pay The fine of festal treason, and prepare A banquet of revenge, that fiends might smile To view! Uriah comes, and in himself an host Arm'd with his wrongs, he soon shall shake the walls Of parasitic power! the kindred hosts Of Ammon and of Tadmor thro' the tribes That line yon courts, would scatter less dismay If our designs succeed! Abd. Too well I know Uriah's spirit—still untractable And stern, he moulds his manners on the code Of our republic: and her name adores With true devotion: our neglected laws He so reveres, that neither power, nor wealth (Tho' next to regal honours on his brow Were plac'd, with liberal hand) could bend his soul To smother his revenge or let his wrath Be satisfied with gentler penalty Than what the law requires. Shim. And that is death With propagated shame! Abd. And wouldst thou wish That shame should reach to David? could'st thou bear To find the name of that heaven favour'd man Tainted with scandal's vile ignoble blot An imputation, made by factious hands Perhaps the fuel of the people's rage?— Shim. aside. Then is it as I fear'd—this interview Was timely—but I must dissemble now And wear the mask of loyalty! To Abd. My soul Is seiz'd with horrour at the thought!—But still Some moderate method may be found, to steer Between the wild extremes, the Sanhedrim And popular delegates at Salem now Conven'd, thy art may sound—they all revere The patriot's name, and hate the haughty man Who leads our armies—and, for selfish ends Fires, with incessant schemes of foreign wars The royal mind, that he may hold the sword.— His is the power—the shadow here remains Behind at Salem—should the general vote Prefer Uriah, (ere the husband knows His bed's abuse,) his wrongs perhaps might rest In long oblivion.—Bathsheba's return To welcome home her warriour, with the spell Of loyalty and wedded love at once, Might lull the whirlwind to a lasting calm. Abd. Be it my business then to sound the tribes Perhaps the monarch, struck with deep remorse Nor less by merit won (by chance, or heaven Combin'd, at this fair crisis) may consent To crown the warriour, tho' he wrong'd the man And all at last be amity and peace. [Exit Abdon. Shim. Go! loyal fool! and, like the sightless mole Mine for me! while the rude materials rais'd By thy blind industry, shall raise a pile Of finer masonry, exalted far Above the present fabric, which thy love So idolizes! this Jessean stem If Fate's mysterious volume right I read Shall know no second spring! He little dreams I hate Uriah too! vain-glorious man! He scorns the courtier, prizes honesty, And looks contemptuous on the lazy herd That bask at ease, beneath the royal beam At home, while he sustains the sultry noon And reaps an iron harvest—not aware That, bought and sold, the single-hearted slave Toils out his weary youth to feed our pride But we are grateful—witness he, who walks Thro' yonder shades in contemplation deep Fain would I listen—but his friend is near Achitophel, the partner of our hopes— He will discover all in proper time Nor at this crisis would I here be found! [Exit Shimei. DAVID, (ACHITOPHEL—at a distance.) Yet, thanks to Heaven—some feelings are alive, The gangrene has not spread o'er all my soul! I am not quite embruted, quite debas'd Below th'inferior orders, whose prone looks Contemplate earth, for I can view yon sun, And all the dread magnificence of heaven With looks erect; but not of filial awe.— It slashes terror on me! When it frowns I feel a night within, Cimmerian gloom In double pomp of horror! When it smiles, The opening scenes of yon proud theatre Display that ample range, where late my muse Wing'd her proud way exulting. Now, alas! Drooping she sits, with moulted plumes, below, And scarcely seems to wonder at her fall! Yet more than all those elements combin'd In dread explosion bursting on my head, I fear the looks of that much injur'd man, Injur'd beyond repair, beyond the wealth Of Egypt to repay. I sent for him— And yet I seem his coming steps to feel Weighty as lead upon my sinking heart.— Yet such a chaos domineers within That I scarce know the motive of those throbbs That rend my heart-strings. Whether keen remorse, Or dread of heaven, or that antipathy That rival feels for rival in his love— And now he comes,—and in her burning cheek And in her alienated eye confus'd He soon will see that sacred spark of love Quite gone, that us'd to welcome his return, Bath'd in the honest twinkling tear of joy! This soon he must perceive, or he has lost That piercing sense for which I lov'd him once— And must I see him too? I sent for him— And must I shrink beneath my servant's eye Debas'd, a crouching slave, before a slave? It is but justice.—He, that fear'd not heaven Should tremble at his fellow dust!—The man Whose coward conscience tells him he has sinn'd Flies, when no foe pursueth. Time has been When I was lion-hearted, but, alas! I then was righteous—I can trace the steps That led from guilt to guilt, a downward way But to revisit light, and mount again, Appears a task, beyond the strength of man; And who shall raise me from the murky den Which I myself have dug? Shalt thou? [Seeing Achitophel. From thee, And thy pernicious counsels, I derive The ruin of my peace. Ach. My sovereign lord, My faithful counsels— David. —Fed my passions high. 'Twas thou inflam'd my pride, and woke the war With Ammon Viz. The treatment of his Ambassadors by Hanun, son to the King of Ammon. 2 Sam. 10., for a slight affront, a wrong Which wisdom would have smil'd at. Thou advis'd To leave the toils and hazard of the war To Joab, and rest at home, lull'd by the sound And distant din of arms. Viz. The treatment of his Ambassadors by Hanun, son to the King of Ammon. 2 Sam. 10. A stripling's scorn Must be repaid with blood, while sloth at home Fosters worse passions. Had I brav'd the field, And cop'd alone with unbelieving foes, Cas'd in bright arms, beneath the beam of noon, My worst foe had not found me! Ach. Witness Heaven! Witness my honour unimpeach'd! no views But for thy sacred safety sway'd my voice To counsel thy delay! David. O blessed times, Tho' deem'd afflictive, when, from hill to hill I fled the royal blood-hounds! Them I thought My only foes, my only trust was Heaven! His favour to obtain, my vigilance And caution still with keen, observant eye, Guarded against the taint of every vice, I saw but one protector, but one way To gain his favour. Every morning shone On some new miracle. Some wond'rous scene Of prompt deliverance. Ach. Let my sovereign lord Not forfeit his dependance. On despair Heaven frowns, and hates the soul that doubts his love. David. His love!—Too much I trusted in his love! Abus'd his mercy and his power defy'd, But now, alas, I dread the eye of man. My heart is bare and bleeding—every glance Sends a shaft thro' it—tho' but late it seem'd Enclos'd in steel. Say, is Uriah come? And is there hope to veil the glaring shame From every eye, but Heaven's—for man to man Is an inhuman judge, and I have foes That soon would dog my name, and hunt it down Thro' every maze of endless infamy! Ach. Uriah is return'd. David. And wherefore yet Has he not claim'd an audience? Tho' I dread To see him, yet his absence wounds me more. I know not what to wish, or to enquire Has he vouchsaf'd a visit yet at home?— Or has allegiance vanquish'd love, and sent The gallant, injur'd warrior, first to pay His duty to his king? Ach. At your command His motions all are spy'd. David. And what result? Torture me not with doubt; nor, on your life Dare to conceal the worst! Ach. Compell'd, adjur'd, My loyalty commands, what love would hide. Ere those you sent had met him on the way, Who meant, beneath some seeming fair pretext To tend his footsteps till they lodg'd him safe Lest any foul report, or dark surmise Should taint his eyes, or ears—he was observ'd In close and serious conference with Shimei.— David. Then all is public—that curst Benjamite (Sworn foe to me and mine) has told the tale Whate'er he knew, and what he knew not, feign'd Disloyal, tardy slaves! whose task it was To meet him first, and keep his mind serene From each contagious rumour! all is lost! Has he yet reach'd his home, or have you learn'd Of his reception there? Ach. I had not means.— David. How seem'd he on his coming to the palace? I know his open nature, far above Dissembling, or the usual craft of courts Whate'er he feels, his feelings he proclaims, Each look and gesture shows his inmost soul— Oh! could I read his looks!—but mine would show What most I want to hide! Ach. He will not brook (Proud, and a soldier as he is) to tell Whate'er he knows to all, if aught he knows— David. If aught he knows!—where'er the serpents sang Was fixt, the poison rankles in the wound— And Shimei's love to me I long have known!— That Benjamite by every art has try'd To taint my purest actions with the stain Of some malignant view, and put the mask Of malice, even on innocence—oh then What horrid vizors for deformity?— It needs none, for the slightest hint of truth Is foul enough! Ach. Yet Shimei scarce would dare To give his venom breath—for, well I know The coward tongue would falter in his fears He is not one whom noble Natures soon Would condescend to trust!—there is between His nature, and Uriah's such repulse Such fierce antipathy as ne'er would blend Their jarring natures in one common view Or common trust.— David. Go find him, and explore His spirit, while I study to receive him. [Ex. severally. End of the First Act. ACT II. SCENE I. An open Space before the Palace of David. URIAH. Would I had fallen in battle! all the rage Of onset, siege, and storm, is but my peace To what I feel within!—I thought thee false O Shimei—and Bathsheba, truth itself!— What baneful art has ruin'd thee and me!— For thou must fall—if justice yet is left In Israel, nor will I thy doom survive To linger out in shame a hated life The mark of public scorn! a man, who prest Still foremost in the paths of honest fame! Yes! justice shall be done! for David lives David, whose life by these heaven-favour'd hands Of old was sav'd.—'Tis he will right my wrongs And he will greatly vindicate my fame (For that calumnious tale, with mystic art Hinted by that vile Benjamite, I scorn To think of it! and would to heaven, the rest Were false alike!—) but I have seen too much Her looks, her words confirm'd it! but an hour Of calm deliberate scrutiny will come! To search the maze of deep iniquity— And then,—for vengeance! vengeance!—To the King My duty first I'll pay, (as he requires) And paint the glorious progress of his arms! 'Tis needful soon, lest frenzy, or despair Should seize my faculties ere I fulfill A loyal soldier's and an envoy's due. To him, ADRIEL. Uri. Welcome, my friend! But what dost thou behold In me, to touch your features with concern So ill disguis'd, and deep, as what I see In every line of that once chearful face? Before we met you seem'd to turn away And hide a burning blush! Was it for me, You blush'd, my friend? Was it for me that tear Stole down your glowing cheek? Have I behav'd Or, as a soldier, or a friend, to bring Shame on my friends? Uriah knows no guilt, No soldier's stain, nor will he hang the head For others folly. Come, my friend, I know My wife is false! Adr. The tongue of calumny That oft envenoms virtue, here, perhaps, Has stain'd the stainless! Uri. Be it so, my friend; Then I will search the slander to the source, And be it distant, as the springs of Nile, Or high as Sinai's thund'ring tops; the power That spoke his mandates thence, shall see this arm Assert his sacred law, by Israel heard, Thou shalt not bear false witness. Adr. Well resolv'd! Uri. Ah, were that all, my friend! But much I fear, The foul contagious air of courts has breath'd Infection thro' my dwelling; how, or whence It came, I know not. But the plague has spread! It has possess'd her blood! Her mantling cheek And trembling eyes confess'd it; too serene Was once that heavenly aspect, not to show The smallest vapour which disturbs the peace That dwelt within, for many a tranquil day, In better times! Now, all is dark and deep, Tho' dress'd in borrow'd smiles! She scarce had breath To speak my welcome—cold to my embrace, I felt not there that throbbing heart that us'd To beat in unison with mine! Adr. Perhaps, The sland'rous tale has reach'd her ears, and she Is apprehensive that thine ear has drunk The deadly poison, and thy rage believ'd The foul, calumnious tale. This thought might wound The purest bosom, and induce a tinge On the most innocent cheek, to look like guilt.— Your visit was but short! Suspend your judgment 'Till but to-morrow's dawn arrive. This night May bring conviction! Uri. What! this night! this night Am I to sleep, and will some angel come To tell me in a dream my spouse is true?— Or must I, lull'd by charms to soft repose, Perhaps, within a practis'd harlot's lap, Help out her soft assertion of her truth With all a husband's fond credulity? No—by my father's shade! By all the tombs Of all that line, whose honourable dust No stain like this has tarnish'd, I will tear The mantle from this mystery, ere I sleep, Or never sleep again! Adr. Say, wouldst thou watch Her door, or lie in ambuscade at home? This wild demeanour, if she still is pure, She soon would know, then hate, and deadly scorn Would pay your ill-starr'd pains! Uri. And must I doubt For ever? Have I neither friend nor foe To end my vain suspence at once? Adr. This night, If thou regardst my counsel. Shun thy house, And lodge with me! Uri. I know thou art my friend, And yet thy softest implication sounds Like thunder! What sad change, or deadly form Of danger, lurks at home? Or must I give My room to others! Say, what blasting power Of earth or hell shall cross a husband's steps That goes to visit home? Adr. Mistake me not. You torture every word to guilty meaning, To images of shame and turpitude, Which on the canvass of the passing clouds, Your sick'ning fancy draws! I meant no guilt, Or danger in thy parting or thy stay! Uri. Long since, we have exchang'd our souls! our love Surpass'd a female's fondness: can I think You treat me like a froward child! to lull My sense of honour by a drowsy charm To bid me sit down calmly with my wrongs And wink at broad detection? Tell me, friend, Does this become a soldier and a man Not lowest in esteem? Adr. To that high point I wish to raise thee, which thy merit claims Where worth like thine will meet its due reward; Thy country calls thee!—To Uriah's name The public chorus chants her sweetest praise, Mixt with indignant murmurs; when it sees Thy merit sunk, beneath its pitch so far Subordinate to fawning slaves, whose tongues By licking up imperial dust, have cleans'd Their way to wreaths for which they never bled!— Uri. Where wouldst thou lead me? thro' what mighty breach Of loyalty and law conduct my steps In vanity's broad mirrour to behold My puny shadow stretch'd to giant size, And menacing the moon—I am not craz'd Nor (tho afflicted deep) can yet mistake The moody madness of a moon-struck brain For sober reason.—Adriel! I perceive Your friendly purpose, in my private wounds To pour the soothing balm of public love— And lead me gently from the precipice Where reason's self grows giddy!—but once more Why leave my home to-night?— Adr. Because a prize Worthy a soldier may this night be won A game, to save a kingdom! far beyond The chace of idle rumours! meanwhile, tell Does your proud general keep his old esteem Among his bands? Say, has he learn'd of late To triumph over hearts, no more content With humble looks alone?— Uri. Neither time Nor place accords with such a question now;— This, of my general ask'd—my ready sword Had to another's inquisition given A suitable reply! Adr. Reply to me Not as a soldier, but a trusty friend That knows to whom he speaks, and therefore dares No calumny exists in private words No faithful bosoms trusted. Uri. True, if nought Invidious, or detracting, from my words, Calumnious art, against the great in name Or office, may derive: that vapour draws Her poison, from the most innoxious flowers That e'er perfum'd the gale! Adr. Art thou become That honest, loyal bigot of the camp That does his duty boldly, and winks hard, (Whene'er his general bids him face the foe) And sees no danger?—Hast thou sunk so far The citizen of Israel in the soldier As not to see and feel th'enormous load Our martial honours lay upon our necks?— How gaudy does the cause of glory seem Like meteors, streaming thro' the waste of night! Like them, it waves sublime, to witch the world With gaudy draperies; but, like them, portends The sounding hurricane, that sweeps away At once, the ripen'd harvest and the swain.— 'Twas thus you thought, ere war became a trade When the bold peasant flung away his goad And seiz'd his javelin at his country's call— Then hung his shield aloft and join'd the plough. But, now, in endless wars on wars engag'd Where veterans, grown beneath their helmets gray Forget they have a country you have learn'd The dialect in vogue, and spurn the swain Who groans beneath the burden of your wars If his too liberal tongue but glance a hint Against th'imperial politics, that teach Unbounded conquest, and unbounded sway! Uri. You wrong me much, my friend! there is no heart In all Judæas bands, which throbbs more quick At freedom's call, than mine! or more regrets The time, when our victorious flag (which now Hangs like a meteor, o'er the troubled east Portending ruin) more benignly shone Like Phosphor, o'er those native hills, a sign Of gentle peace, to all but Israel's foes Invading foes—but now, we seek them far From home—and seem to love the cruel trade Even for itself! Adr. Believe me, friend! there lies Beneath the splendid pile of trophied arms A deep abyss of ruin for the state!— Ambitious views, and overweening thoughts Ideal crowns, and sceptres in the grasp Already lead our leader, we pursue And ask not why, nor whither. Uri. Such designs In other minds at other times may grow— But our commander ne'er will bribe his host Such dangerous lengths! Adr. Thro' want of power—perhaps I doubt his self-denial. Uri. Be th'effect From this, or from whatever cause deriv'd His honours on his loyalty recline And that reposes singly on the name Of David. Adr. You already have return'd All unawares, the answer I desired And clear'd my doubts, then from himself he holds No claim to general love; has he no arts Of popularity? Uri. His arts are vain Since his ill-omen'd hand in Abner's blood Was dy'd, tho' bold in arms, in counsel wise Tho' with the semblance of paternal love He courts his gallant bands, their hearts revolt. Tho' by their King's command, their hands are his. His persidy to Saul's lamented friend So taint his every deed, his every look, His words seem fawning, and his liberal gift The purchase of sedition—that foul deed Attaints the general, and degrades the man. Adr. On kingly favour then he rests alone!— Say, should the rays of royal grace illume Some heroe in eclipse, and point their rays Full on another head, would Israel's bands Approve the monarch's choice? Uri. I question that,— His Abishai. brother still, with honest martial worth Of half the popular indignation, robs The general's name, obnoxious tho' it be— Another choice might sow dissension's rage Among the troops. Adr. But Israel's choice at home The sanction of the tribes, the senate's voice Would, like the word, that bids the troubled deep Compose her tumult, send a sacred calm Among the hosts of Jacob. Uri. The intent Of your discourse, I know not—if to soothe My grief, you miss the means! while thus you gall My sore impatience—Was I sent for home To vent at large my unavailing sighs For undeserved shame, or lend my breath To faction's aims! Adr. And art thou yet to learn The general discontent, that spreads around From tribe to tribe, and what the delegates Intend, this moment in full counsel met,— An awful consistory? thou shalt know Their purpose soon, and you, perhaps, may hear Uriah's name the master-note that fills, The awful harmony of popular claims. Uri. Uriah's name! Adr. No longer will they bear Oppression's iron rod, nor brook the sway Of those confederates, who have rul'd the state So long at random; now a single word, Perhaps, will break the charm! Uri. And were my name That of the luckiest rebel, who dissolv'd The bonds of loyalty, and blew the storm From mutiny to madness, 'till the crown, Purchas'd by blood, adorn'd the villain's brow. Sooner upon the footstool of the throne My blood should flow in royalty's defence, Than this right hand should break the hallow'd bounds That lets in loud misrule to lord it wide O'er sacred order and imperial sway.— Even gratitude, and friendship's ties forbid.— I love my king, his virtues well I know, To them I trust in time to break the cloud, And chace the noxious fogs that hide his beams. Adr. You wrong my meaning much, if you surmise I wish to tempt you from your loyalty— I rather hope that some high office waits Your coming, either in the court or camp, To serve thy king, and Israel's state at once; Some station, whence your eye, like yonder beam, May pierce corruption's haunts, and bid it die, And wither up the foul and noxious stems Of luxury and vice, where'er they spring.— This David owes thee, and I trust, he means The retribution now, for much it taints His fame, to leave his long-try'd friend obscure, (Altho' his worth compells a nation's praise) Like day's bright lamp, which, tho' beneath the deep, Yet wakes the warbling lark's instinctive song.— Shouldst thou succeed, the choice would soon dispell All discontent, and lay the rising storm.— If he neglect thee, and continue still His favour to that dark society That fill the court and camp, would'st thou refuse A hand to help to save a sinking state, When Israel claims thine aid? Uri. I see not yet The pressing need to leave the beaten track Of loyalty. Adr. And may it never come! Yet time, my friend, may soon discover more! Then, if thy country calls, attend the call, Nor fear to spread thy pinions to the gale, Mount to an eagle's pitch, and boldly soar Against the sun, if fate demands thy rise! Think on thy wrongs, if any faults be found Where most thou fear'st. Remember Israel's claim— And, when I see thee next, be resolute, Be fearless, as becomes thy country's friend, Be bold, be cautious, and avoid thy home. [Exit Adriel. Uri. Was it a demon in a friendly form That came to tempt me thus!—I yet am firm— The noxious spell has neither touch'd my head Nor heart. I feel the seat of reason clear— What am I then to think, or what resolve. Think on my wrongs. Why, then, my shame is known. Yon travel'd sun but propagates the tale From east to west! Yet I must shun my home! Or glares the proof abroad?—perhaps—at court. Or from the court my shame at first began. For we, that fight the battles of our king, And bear the vengeance of our God against Rebellious states, and purge the noxious clime, Yet know not what pollution breeds at home, Or what foul vapours taint the stagnant calm Of high-vic'd cities. Some new favourite Of this new faction, that besiege the throne Of too indulgent David, has undone My peace for ever; yet, whoe'er he is, My friend even dreads to name him. Should it be David's two eldest sons.Amnon, or Absalom, my sovereign lord Will not, like old lethargic Eli, spare The criminal, for his exalted rank, Or royalty of blood. Yet why my friend Should warn me thus to keep aloof. Some spell Or danger lurks within. I have it! Fiends! The veil is drawn at last! O stupid, numb'd To sense! O for a long and quiet sleep! Unvisited by dreams! O for the wings of eagles to escape This odious scene, and the detested truth That rushes on my sense—pursues my steps With harpy stings. Madness were ease to this! I then was call'd for home, to cloak her shame.— The foul adult'ress! lest the swelling crime Should force discovery 'ere the camp allows A regular return. Oh, Adriel, Would thou hadst kept the secret! Yet I thank thee— Thank thee—for frenzy—madness. Yet I'm calm! I will collect myself! Ah now I know, Too well I know thy kind assiduous care, To lure me from the soul-corroding scene To fairy strains of popular applause!— Yet I will keep my post—besiege the court Till day succeeds to night, and night to day. Well am I us'd to watching, care and toil, In Israel's cause; and in my sov'reign's ear, Even in his dreams, I'll hollow for revenge; And, if I fail, I'll find the way to reach The nearest to the throne, or shake the seat Of royalty itself with my appeal. [Exit Uriah. Scene changes to an inner Apartment of the Palace. DAVID. How all things change, thro' the dark medium seen Of self-abhorrence, and the gloom of sin! Yon sun that us'd to lift my mental view Thro' boundless journies, till his lamp was lost On the pure limits of eternal day, Seems but a flickering taper now, that leads To the licentious bower. Yon quiet groves, Where, when the day-star, (sunk beneath the deep) Call'd in his wand'ring glories, when forlorn The widow'd evening flung her gaudy robes Aside, and walk'd the woods in graver state, Sedate and slow; when each dim alley seem'd To fluctuate with aerial shapes, that mov'd Celestial measures to the soothing swell Of the soft breeze, which, thro' the lofty sweep Of the green theatre, alternate rose, Alternate sunk, and varied with soft touch The waving scenery of the pendent gloom! How did the movements of my soul accord With the grave minstrelsie! But now, these woods Put on the pomp of Hades. Whispering fiends Mock the sweet woodland echoes, till they seem To sicken at their breath! They line my walks, Marshall my lonely steps, and, thro' the air, Hurl their dark spells that check the mounting thought, And tame the soaring soul to base pursuits, Like the sad bird that skims the mantled pool When humid vapours clog his weary wings. To him, ONIAH. [ONIAH] Why seek this secret place to tell your tale, Is it too dreadful for all ears but mine? Be not dismay'd, but give your message breath; I who have wander'd desarts, by distrust Attended, and with danger at my heels, Have not so far forgot my former toils But I can bravely meet whatever doom Heaven may intend! Aside. Oh ill-supported boast! Guilt has unedg'd my firmest, best resolves, And stolen the hero's temper from my soul! Oniah. Pardon, my lord, and, if my tongue offends, Think it an organ, by the powers above, Reluctant, in an odious task employ'd! David. Whate'er it be, with confidence declare Thy message; I must learn to bear the worst. What has been, has been, nor can fate recall The deeds of yesterday, the deep remorse Of years to come! Oniah. Whatever is to come, Heaven tells not. All her oracles are dumb To thy enquiries. David. In the people's voice, Perhaps, it speaks too plain! That awful organ Is often touch'd by Heaven. Did Zadok give No answer? Oniah. What he said, I shall report Most truly—when I pray'd him to apply For counsel to th'eternal majesty That dwells between the cherubim—I dare not, Was his abrupt reply. “I saw last night “An awful vision sent from him, who lives “For ever. In the holiest place of all “Methought I stood, and saw the heavenly lamp “Burn ominously dim, all mute and sad “Seem'd the attendant choir, the warbled hymn “Paus'd on a sudden, and their startled looks “Were all bent upward, with expectance dread “Of some descending terrour from above “Clad in empyreal glory; when anon “Like light'ning it appear'd, and quick was gone— “And all was desolate and dark, forlorn “And silent; but the flash forerun the storm “Soon rose below a tempest of misrule “And various clamour, like the winds of Heaven “That lash th'insurgent waves,—the dread result “To me is all unknown, nor Heaven vouchsafes “By oracle or Urim to unfold “His will at large.” David. I only wish'd to know If by th'expulsion of a man, involv'd In tenfold guilt, I might, in part, appease Heaven's anger, which against me seems to burn! This is denied—and yet—the voice within Tells what the vision meant, too plain—but still The sanction of the prophet was requir'd— —Was Nathan found at last? Oniah. Long was the search And hopeless, till at last we trac'd him on To Moreh's hill; with hasty march he strode To the tall summit, which o'erlooks the vale Of Hinnom, where the dark flood finds below His gulfy way, then looking back, he cast An angry glance, “Yon city soon shall pour “Her worst abominations forth in vain— “Other abominations shall succeed!” “Loud in the breeze I hear the birds of prey “I see them hover o'er yon hated roof “Then westward wing their way, till Ephraim's wood “Presents an unexpected feast,” no more He deign'd, but plung'd amid the forest gloom Inscrutable to eyes profane, where still He shuns all human converse. David to Oniah, who retires. Retire, but within call—celestial light! Yet thou wilt deign some dubious rays, before Thou set'st for ever! A welcome radiance, waning tho' it be And dim! I will not lose the sacred glimpse But now begin my long-neglected task Tho' late, yet not unconquerably hard And labour in the twilight—first I'll chace This man of blood from Israel—that when time Allows—and to my injur'd friend repay In gifts and honour, what by me he lost If they can pay such wrongs as his. To Oniah. Dispatch And call the delegates of Israel—now Their king expects them and attends their claims. End of the Second Act. ACT III. SCENE I. A Court before the Palace of David. Enter JOAB disguised. [JOAB] What do I see and hear? I left one siege It seems, to stand another! Rabbah's streets Were I this moment hem'd by hostile spears Were not more dangerous to my hunted life Than Salem's sacred squares.—I heard my name In execrations sent from lip to lip As if it breath'd infection! I would find As many hands to end my hated life As if the sons of Ammon dog'd my heels Were I but known among them! soon I'll learn The drift of this commotion, and, perhaps Discharge it on my foes.—'Tis true, the people Have been aggriev'd, and, should their curses light As they are meant, there lives not one whose life Is more obnoxious! But I much admire Why David hides his head, and lets the storm Roll on resistless, like th'unbridled winds! Great was his ancient influence—great the love His people bore him, else my blood, long since, Had paid the public hatred, but I hung On him, like clasping ivy on the oak, And while the vigorous root supply'd his stem, My branches flourish'd green. But who are these, Who toward the palace move in solemn pomp?— By all my fears, the delegates of Israel. What can it mean? I'll mingle with the crowd, And learn their destination! Could I trust The rumour of the day, they threaten me! I'll follow with the stream, but find, perhaps, A way at length to fix a lasting mound Before the fury of the people's power. AMOZ, HELKIAH, with the other Delegates of the People, approach the Palace. To them, ACHITOPHEL. [ACHITOPHEL] The king has sent me—(so I must pretend) —[Aside]. From you to learn the purport of your claims, Ye might have staid, till from the conquer'd foe, Our general came triumphant, and laid down His crested pride, to join in sage debate. We then confirm your laws. Hilk. The general's voice Is futile here; in his own cause, no man Is judge and advocate! The law we come Now to propose regards himself the first. Ach. If it be wrong to judge the meanest man Unheard, and unimpeach'd, then judge not him! Hilk. On him we lay no blame; nor derogate From his illustrious rank, and kindred ties To Jesse's royal stem; but this, (with him) Respects a public cause! Ach. Declare your grievance. Hilk. It has been oft declar'd, but still in vain. But pent up waters, though deep mounds oppose, Will find their way at last. It is more fit To form a regular channel for its rage, Than to confine its fury, lest it rise In dread rebellion, and convulse the globe.— Why does the flower of Israel waste its prime In foreign fields, while years on years revolve, And sees our bounds extend, our people fade. The soldier's glossy raven locks assume. The griesly hue, beneath the batter'd helm. At home the hind out-toils the travel'd sun, And sees the harvest of his labour, swept Away, to feed the famine of the war. And, worse (if worse can be) to waste at home The soul infections of an haughty court! Ach. Whence this new insolence? Hilk. Achitophel, You much mistake, or wilfully misname Our privilege; this insolence is old, Old as the days of Aaron. Then the voice Of the assembled tribes was law and truth, Tho' now it sounds in some fastidious ears Like treason! Ach. What you gave, ye would resume. When, all unable to defend yourselves Against the numerous foes, that hem'd you round On every hand, and held in manacles Your martial ardour; then you claim'd a king (Such as the nations boast) to lead you on To conquest and to glory, now, averse To your own choice (a choice confirm'd above) Ye would undo your work, and grudge to bear That easy load ye laid upon yourselves. But this, were this allow'd, by sudden change Would quite unhinge all government, and break The settled course of things; as if the moon Of bleak December should assert her right O'er July's sultry calm, and freeze his dews In her cold crystal urn. Amoz. Those arguments Your royal master needs not to support His state, for in his subjects hearts he reigns: Nor needs the claims of tyranny, to guard His firm, establish'd throne; it is to give His power a better basis we propose These laws. Our loyal meaning is to give Our King a surer title to our loves, And counsel him to trust his sacred cause To those we can confide in. This we claim— We wish to see old Judah's line restor'd To its first honours, and we must have way.— Ach. Ye know not whom ye toil for, if ye did Ye were more culpable, but now, no more Ye know the hand that turns your headlong rage To his own factious purpose, than the mass Which from its flaming gorge the mountain flings Knows, why it falls in ruin on the swains And lays their harvest low! Hil. We need not blush To name the man, whose virtues long have won A nation's confidence, and given them trust In all his days to come! Ach. Produce the man Whose merit soars above the common pitch Of statesmen and of heroes! Amoz. Who can doubt The man, or who has borne so mean a lot In Israel's tribes, as never to have heard Uriah's name? Ach. His virtues are allow'd By all, nor can that age be quite corrupt When such men are esteem'd! But should the King Allow such ready monitors at will To win their way by clamour, and besiege His throne, on every petty discontent What would become of majesty and awe What would become of Israel, still the prey Of every popular gust? yet mean I not To slight your grave proposal, when I find The sanction of the senate join your claims, But these are sudden measures and require Deliberation. To degrade the man Whom years have crown'd with glory, seems a step That leads to danger. Amoz. For ourselves, we scorn The danger, and we know the general host Abhors their leader's view; nor aught supports Obedience in the camp but David's name Remove that column, and the general sinks With all his martial fame. Ach. Of this I own Some symptoms have appear'd, the people's voice Demands respect—but, for this day, the King Requests a respite, till to-morrow's dawn Matures his counsels, some domestic cares At present have engross'd the royal mind To these he dedicates his present hours! To-morrow is the peoples! [After a short conference with the rest. Amoz. We depend Upon his wisdom, and with joint assent Postpone our message, till he claims our presence [Exeunt Delegates. Ach. The man who watches not the turning tide Nor weighs his anchor, when the current serves Must leave his vessel stranded on the beach And mourn the moments lost! I did not rise To this uncertain height to stem the blast Of popular favour. He, that holds the helm Of state should learn to veer with every wind And have a harbour still secure and safe On whatsoever coast the shifting gale Blows from all quarters under heaven—I saw This tempest in the cradle, nor despis'd Its infant frowns, nor, when it grew at last To giant size, it found me unprepar'd To ride the wild waves in my steady barque!— Let Joab and them, who scorn'd to shun the flaw Beneath its fury sink!—for me, I scorn To share the sounding fall of wilful men.— Another crew may man the toiling ship Tho', by themselves undone, the mariners Were all swept overboard. Uriah then Is Israel's favourite, and too well I know The guilty reason why the conscious King Would wish to raise him!—He has one way left To calm the people's and the husband's rage At once; I see the former chief's decline And this new favourite's rise—whate'er I owe The general, to myself a larger debt Is due, nor will I break the ancient law Of self-defence, to aid a desperate cause— But who comes here?— Enter a MESSENGER. Mess. My lord! a stranger sues For audience. Ach. Let him come Mess. He shuns the view Of public eyes. Ach. Let him declare to you His business. Mess. He refuses to disclose To any ear but yours', whate'er he claims! Ach. What means this mystic semblance? does he seem A foreigner or native, one of rank Plebeian, or above the common herd? Mess. His habit speaks the soldier! but he seems A man, that on himself alone depends Scorning the sun-shine and the storms of life Not us'd to tremble at a despot's nod But daring to confront him; as the time And his disguise allow'd me, in his mein And port, I this could learn. Ach. I hazard not An interview with strangers—I have foes That seek my life! before I see this man He must with cautious hand be scrutiniz'd For private arms. Mess. Already that is done He of himself unfolded all his robe And bade me search him round! Ach. Then let him wait My coming at the secret place of audience. Scene changes to a Closet in the Palace. ACHITOPHEL, A STRANGER. Ach. What is your business, that in secret thus You wish to have transacted here?—my time Incessantly employ'd in public cares No trivial interruption needs. [Joab discovering himself. Amazement! The general in the palace! Joab. Yes—I watch While you securely sleep, nor seem to mind The pent-up storm that seems to rage beneath And threats to blow you to the moon! for me I heard its voice afar, I mark'd its rage Even from the camp, till under Salem's towers It threatens dread explosion! Ach. For what end I know not, but for some important end The noble chief forsakes his watchful post By Rabbah's towers, in those more dangerous walls To face his unseen foes, that brew a storm Which menaces more near. Joab. Ideal horrours Of popular commotion! Let it rage I've weather'd many worse! but this appears A reptile, noxious vapour, carrying plagues Deep in its bosom, which it sows around And drizzles death, where'er it sweeps along, Already has it poison'd half the camp And now it sails away, and threats the city. Ach. Be calmer! and by certain signs describe Your secret foe. Joab. His name at once declar'd Discovers all—Uriah. Ach. Whence your dread Of him? Joab. Are you to learn his guileful arts His serpent fraud, that hisses as it stings His whisper'd faction thro' the tribes of Israel— It must be he—for since he join'd our bands They hate the track of glory, and begin To sigh for home—there was a time, of late When honour was a soldier's sole religion— But now, by yonder heaven, they talk of right The rights of men and citizens, nor think That fields, manur'd with blood, and leaguer'd walls And thund'ring battlements (to swell the fame Of conquerors and Kings), and laureate wreaths To the survivors, pay the sighs and groans Of a few mournful widows! Ach. What or who Has taught them this new doctrine? have the murmurs Of this seditious city reach'd the camp?— Or is there one among themselves who sows Those cockles in their minds? Joab. I tell thee, statesman Uriah must be he! Ach. Uriah's name! Say, is it sounded with more dread than yours? Does he command the camp, conduct the siege? Are you the rebel's master or his slave?— What dread enchains your tongue, or what prevents Your sentence on your substitute? Joab. His art Baffles my rage, nor does he leave a mark Even for the shafts of slander to insix Its venom'd point. In loyalty's close mask He veils the soulness of his deep designs In darkness and in doubt! the common camp Adores his name!—with more than wizard spell Still as the factious clamour swells to Heaven His balmy elocution sooths the storm Like lenient oil on turbid waters pour'd— Thus voluble and artful as the snake That poisons with a kiss, he slips the hold And baffles the pursuer! Ach. Curse his virtues! Worse than the red plague, and the hidden fire That wins its fearful way against the wind His fame infects even here! the noisy crowd That haunt our streets return his hated name In echo to the camp, the storm you fear'd Has crost another whirlwind in its way And sweeps the forest with redoubled rage! Joab. And thou and I will in the whirlwind fall Unless we foil its fury! Fate or chance That led me here, I thank thee! else my hand Perhaps had never drawn th'imperial sword! —Canst thou conjecture yet the King's intent With what new honours he designs to load His favourite? Ach. But, that I know the King Bound to his friends by more than kindred tyes For loyalty, and long-try'd services I would have thought he meant to raise him high Or in the civil or the martial line. Joab. It was not then for nought the soldiers seem'd To hail his name at parting, with the sound Of many a hearty farewell, and the strain Of public benedictions mixt with tears!— I see the deadly birth of many a moon Begin its dreadful progress in the clouds And fall at length in horror on my head We must return the poison to his lips Or learn to drain the venom'd bowl ourselves.— Ach. Depend upon the King! Joab. The ties of blood! My hapless hand has cut the holy knot Long since—my loyalty is like his love!— By a far different tenure I possess My lofty post, I flourish in his fears He dreads me, like a phantom of the night— Whene'er he dares to turn a steady eye Upon the dark and formidable shape The shape is gone!—Achitophel! to thee This is no mystery! since I clear'd my way To military honours thro' the breast Of Abner!—to my thought, I read my doom Too plain, in David's alienated eye: And did he know, that when he gave the word For slaughter, echo would repeat the doom From many a factious voice in Israel's camp He would not linger long! This to thine ear I trust with safety, for I know thy doom Is link'd with mine, and thou wilt lend thine aid To ward the coming ill. Ach. aside. Is it even so?— Then, let the general sink!—I seize the plank And seek the shore without him! To Joab. Could we fix Some black impeachment on his hated name Or could we calm the people's breath that fill His swelling sails, and wafts him to the post Of royal favour, or, could wishes wake The plagues that swept o'er Egypt, soon his head Should lye as low as Abner's!—But alas! We cannot steer the pinnace of the state Against the heady current of the crowd! Joab. Ha! statesman!—is it thus? have I upheld Your pride and rais'd you from the dust to spurn Your patron! but I come not here, on thee Dependent, for I know thee! other arms And arts are mine, than puny statesmens skill I came no suppliant, with a gentle shower Of woman's tears to court thy slender aid But tell thee, in a voice of thunder, tell thee Thou must dispatch this rival or resolve To sink beneath his influence! he detests Thine arts and thee—the watch-day to the wolf Bears not more mortal enmity than he To thee! and doest thou hope to live, when he Rules paramount? as well the shadowy ghost Might dare the sun's full beam, he dies, or thou Must fall! Ach. aside. I now must soothe him, till I point My dart at leisure for a surer blow! To Joab. Thou hast convinc'd me! but in David's love If he has found protection, who shall dare To snatch him thence? Joab. The law of self-protection! Shall clear thee to thyself! nor have I shar'd With thee so long the chace of common foes To doubt thy skill to circumvent or snare Thine enemies at will! thou hast the ear Of David!—thro' that organ pour the bane That taints the mind, thou strik'st as sure a blow As if the murtherer's dagger arm'd thy hand!— It was no trivial errand call'd me here From Ammon's leaguer'd walls! I could confide The secret to no bosom but my own And thine—reflect, tho' numerous are my foes Yet far more numerous are my friends—they spread, From Tadmor's eastern bounds to Jordan's flood!— Remember this, and let me ne'er behold His hated face again, if thou wouldst wish To see thy friend in peace!—I must away And join my followers, ere the rosy morn Blush for my seeming negligence! adieu. [Ex. Joab. Ach. To-morrow's dawn shall see thee linger here Or I am not Achitophel!—Am I A man to be insulted, menac'd, plung'd In ruin! selfish man! he nought regards My cause, my life, my honour! so I lead His hated rival to the dark abyss He cares not, tho' I drown along! but they Who guide the helm of state, are not to leave The rudder at each hot-brain'd fools' command That mutinies for sway! It seems a trifle For you to leave your camp, in mean disguise To leave the cause of nations on the point And hazard of a moment, to pursue Your guiltless foe, and from your Sovereign's heart Tear the new favourite, and again secure Your station with a second Abner's fall! But I have felt your tyranny too long— I help'd you! but the trade of blood has taught The gratitude of wolves! But now, behold! Thy savage fury drives thee to a snare Thou little dream'st of! (If the King but dares To be that heroe which he was of old And 'venge a peoples wrongs.)—Let him do this,— Sedition's fangs are drawn, and Faction hides Her glaring orbs, that (like the comet's beam Menac'd the state,) in everlasting sleep!— Two savages at once are in my snare If one escapes, he rends me—so perhaps The other may,—but gratitude would bind Uriah's noble nature to repay Life for his life, and thanks for dignity— The other's disposition nought secures But adamant, and Hell's eternal chains.— This is no time to falter, or delay My purpose—who attends there? Bid the guard Secure the outward gate! A spy is caught From Rabbah sent! But see, the King himself; This even exceeds my most exalted hopes! Enter DAVID. David. What means this outcry! these unsual signs Of trepidation which your visage tells As if some terrible conspiracy Was found? Ach. My Lord! if still you think me leagued With the proud general to secure my sway By his audacious aid, vouchsafe to hear And judge my candour, loyalty, and truth By what I now disclose!—in hot pursuit Of brave Uriah's guiltless blood, the chief This military star, the lasting dread Of Ammon, leaves his post in mean disguise And dares, beneath the glance of majesty Beneath the double frown of you and Heaven To dictate murther to me! David. Why, and how? Amazement! can it be? would Joab forsake His station? fling aside the general's staff To seize th'assassin's dagger? we must be Convinc'd of this by more than vague report Belief is tardy to such 'scapes as these, Prodigious, far beyond the reach of faith! Ach. Your own sight shall convince you! for, by this He is secur'd, and now, if e'er you dar'd Or when Goliah or his brother fell Put on the warriour! strike the rebel down With that awaken'd thunder, which (he says,) You fear to wield, and start, even at the flash Of your own bolt! His partizans are gone His faction distant! Here the serpent's head By its own fury and revenge impell'd Has found its way, a single blow decides Its doom, and then, its spires, and deadly sting Will cease to threat! David. How will he meet my eyes? Ach. Oh think no more on that! but crush him now Draw the knot hard that stifles him, or soon The furies from thy hand will snatch the cord And change it to Rebellion's scourge, to drive Thy friends to fill Sedition's deadly files! His fall will soothe their rage! the powers above Have given another cast for royalty! Seize it with noble daring, or you're lost! David. We must not be precipitate! the bent Of Israel's mind would scarcely bear it now! Ach. Think on their hatred for his crime, the theme Of general detestation thro' the tribes! David. Think how his name's ador'd in Israel's host! Ach. 'Tis worth the tryal—you may trust too far!— Resolve to vindicate your name, or go— Go to the wilds again, and stray forlorn In Paran's woods, or in her gloomy caves Conceal your menac'd head! you must not look For Heaven's protection now, as when you fled From Saul!—that was your fate, but this your fault. That was a test of holy confidence But this, distrust in Heaven—resolve, and strike The blow! David, Is he secur'd? Ach. He is, but yet Feels not the pressure of the viewless snare That waves its meshes o'er his sentenc'd head Not to be broken, if your fiat seals His doom, at once!—I go, to give the sign But must not now be seen! David. Go, and return Even with the expedition of a thought— Each moment labours with the births of fate!— His actions speak presumption, next to madness— They call for punishment, or wild misrule Will break subordination, and the child Unborn, may live to curse the nerveless hand Of Israel's King, who let the ruin spread [Exit. Achitophel. Since first I sheath'd the sword that ought to blush With penal blood for the lamented fall Of Abner, still above my guilty head The blade of heavenly justice seems to wave! And is there then no second cause—no more Let me extend the veil of others crimes To hide my own abasement!—Hence, avaunt— Say, whence and what art thou, insidious fiend That strivest with opiate draught to lull the sense Of Inward shame, and point'st another's sin As if the blood of Abner could efface The stain of David! but perhaps the doom Of Joab may break one chain, and give the means Of reparation to that injur'd man Who well deserves, and well can fill the post Of this audacious rebel! He is just, And loves his King, tho' by the crowd rever'd; His name the tumult of the streets resounds His name the awful organ of the state That speaks in Israel's delegated band Exalts, and claims for him the martial wreath 'Tis Heaven itself the welcome choice inspires 'Tis Heaven, that bids the tempest lift its voice And from the deep and stagnant gulf of air Sweeps the contagion of the settled calm Away!—I will obey the awful sign And lull the storm by some great sacrifice Before the whirlwind lays my honour low, And spreads them in the dust—the voice of blood Viz. Of Abnor, whom Joab had assassinated. Cries for revenge, and strikes the vault of Heaven. Exit David. Scene—A Prison. Joab. The statesman's art at last has gain'd the day And I must fall, the victim of my pride And folly!—I have heard of miracles But never knew a lion snar'd before In such a vile envenom'd spider's web.— My blood must pay the purchase of his guile— But force I dread not—David would not risque The stroke of public justice. But the steel Of the assassin, or the well-drug'd bowl Will do the deed, and Abner's fall atone.— Blood will have blood—and is there such a charm In dying groans, that they can pierce the clouds And wake the sleeping thunder?—When I feel The bolt, I will believe it. But my heart Still keeps its wonted measure—I may live (For so my mind presages) to repay My enemies, with grateful recompense.— But who comes here? he does not bear the stamp Of an assassin! royalty and youth Blend in his aspect their united charms —'Tis Absalom—he has not yet forgot His ancient friends, altho' in faithless courts Long educated; well I know his mind Fearless and prompt as light'ning, yet as dark As gathering tempests wrapt in midnight gloom Altho' a beauteous surface hides that heart— —What may this visit bode? To him ABSALOM. Abs. What have we here An eagle in a cage? Joab. True, royal youth! the kites And daws have won the day! Abs. But who could dream To see thee here! Is this thy generalship To leave the siege? Joab. A little time had told The purpose of this step, a slender space Had shown, it was thy cause as much as mine!— The common claim of royalty, the safety Of David's house, as much as my command That led me from the camp in this disguise For one impending peril threatens both. Abs. This artful involution of your cause With ours, were calculated well to gain Our favour, were it true. Joab. By nobler arts In happier times I thought I gain'd your love And, low as I am now reduc'd, I scorn By adulation's little arts to gloss A bad cause over!—What I say, I'll prove.— There is no room for hope, and if there were I scorn by falsehood to obtain the boon. Abs. I came not here to offer hope, or try With empty promises of useless aid To soothe your dying moments—yet, if duty The interest of my father, and the state Permitted me to use my power, thy life Were safe as mine! Joab. I know thy influence well And well you know that I could pay, the price Of thy protection, were I once again In freedom to collect my numerous friends: But let me fall, by vulgar arts o'erthrown, Ere I expose the life of David's son To danger by my flight! Abs. aside. I know thy love— (Rather thy interest—) and could well depend Upon thy loyalty: but other bars Divide my cause and thine—my name upholds The people's privilege! I swell the breath Of opposition; you support the power Of new prerogative extended far Beyond its ancient bounds!— Joab. aside. (I see his views!—) And wouldst thou wish the people's privilege Extended equal to their haughty claims? Wouldst thou desire to see Uriah rule The banded powers of Israel? trust me, Prince! That stern republican would lift his crest Above the fading glories of the crown And with its gems, purloin the public voice To sanctify the robbery! those brave youths Who eastward far in conquest spread the name Of David, soon would see their mould'ring bands Sink like the files of Lebanon before The woodman's stroke! disbanded, or confin'd Tamely in garrisons to waste their prime And on our castled frontiers, face the foe As lordly lions from their range confin'd And chain'd, like shepherds dogs! would this become The throne of Judah? You might see the time When thou wouldst mourn the change, and weep to view The martial fire of Israel thus confin'd To fume away like smother'd lamps, at home! How would the Arab, and the Ammonite Rejoice to see the torrent of our rage That swept their sandy plains, repose at last In dull stagnation? Abs. Tho' I seem to blame The bloody trophies from our neighbours won And fill the cry of faction, to preserve The interest of our family alive And raise an artificial mound, to stem The sinking torrent of the people's love That fleets from David's name so fast away; Yet, were this head ordain'd to sill the crown I would not wish it had a hold so slight As to be puff'd away, by every breath Of popular discontent, I would not chuse A bulrush for my sceptre, to be bent By every breeze that blows! Joab. And wouldst thou wish Like a state-captive, to implore thy guards For liberty—to leave the palace dungeon And breathe the liberal air? wouldst thou submit To have thy progress bounded by the stream Of Cedron's brook, nor ever from the brow Of Olivet to see thy subject vales Wave with their plenteous harvest? this must be The fate of David! he has lost the people, By the same cause that lost his own esteem. And when this head lies low, as soon it must, Be this my consolation, that those eyes Shall not behold my Monarch's low disgrace, Condemn'd at stated holidays to show The gaudy pageant of fallen royalty Led in the rabbles triumph!— Abs. This the sun Shall never see, if I survive to fill The throne of Judah! Joab. How canst thou avoid This doom, if David shows the crowd the way To domineer above the falling crown How wilt thou stem the torrent when it roars When that vile bird, that pecks the royal image Grows to an eagle size, with all her brood Of feather'd imps about her, long enur'd To prey on kingly power? then, who will dare To clip their wings, or lure them from the scent Of palace plunder? not the boasted wand Of Moses, which dismist the living cloud Of locusts to the Erythrean main! Abs. There still are hopes, for yet this vulture's nest Is callow, and a little art can rule The unfledg'd family! Joab. Yes—would the King Resign to thee the sceptre, or admit thee The partner of his throne, he then might rule O'er all the hearts in Israel. Abs. Would that awe Due to my father, to my faltering voice Give its full compass, I could claim my share Of royalty, in thunder's deepest note! Joab. I praise thy piety, that deigns to wait For thy legitimate boon, till sage Uriah A proselyte to loyalty and order Allows the sapient measure, founded deep In wisdom, and permits thy greener boughs To climb the withering stem of royalty And clothe it with new blossoms! Abs. Deep I feel, The keen edge of thy censure! Jesse's stem Was never doom'd to bend and sue for grace To this new favourite, by a female hand Rais'd to the pitch of greatness! Joab. On that theme Silence befits us best. The mind may see What our eyes wink at!— Abs. Yet a thought occurs! I am not deeply read in Israel's story But say—was Saul, the royal Benjamite Chosen by the voice of Heaven, or of the people! Joab. Nam'd by the prophet, but the common vote Confirm'd it! Abs. Then the people in their tribes Pronounc'd the will of Heaven!—another question!— Was not this Benjamite, (altho' by Heaven Propos'd, and by the people's voice confirm'd—) Yet by a righteous mandate set aside Hurl'd from his throne, altho' the sentence hung In short suspence; did he not wear the crown And royal mantle like a victim drest For hallow'd butchery, before he fell In Gilboa's fatal field? Joab. Your sire possess'd The sanction of the prophet—long before The death of Saul. His hatred rose from hence— Hence rose his persecution of thy father. Abs. The people's voice at Hebron chose my father, Their acclamations rais'd him to the stars, But now the buoyance of their breath subsides, And down he sinks! See 1st Sam. last Chap. Joab. Thy words forerun my thoughts, And give that breath, which I had scarce presum'd To picture in my mind! Nay, do not start! The low declining cause of royalty (Tho' by unusual methods) must be prop'd; The public is our first concern, whate'er Becomes of private ties. Abs. 'Tis piety To save a father, plunging in the stream, Tho' at th'expence of half his cumbrous robes, Which hinders his exertion. It were sacrilege To strip a parent, were it not to save His life. Joab. Were but those hands unchain'd, My voice could call ten thousand warlike hands To aid thy claim! Abs. I have the people's voice— Yet such a great and arduous enterprize Throbbs at my heart in ominous presage!— I dread the hazard of a precious life. My father will not tamely share his crown, Tho' all the tribes demand it! He has still His band of heroes to support his claim, Uriah at their head! Joab. Had David fled The prophet's holy unction, he had kept The flocks of Bethlehem still, and never grasp'd The rod of royalty. But thou, perhaps, Hast doubts of me!—Uriah may be found To suit thy purpose better. Abs. Thou betray'st The father! can the son confide in thee? Joab. 'Tis by the son's advancement I preserve The father, for unless with thee he shares The steerage of the state, the barque is lost.— Heaven smite this head with all its choicest plagues If e'er I lost my loyalty to him!— Yet you perceive how he rewards my truth!— Consider, prince, my voice could oft have rais'd A tempest, that had shook his blasted boughs Ere yet he fixt his fibres in the soil!— 'Twas in his cause I rais'd my hasty hand 'Gainst Abner's life, and risqu'd the people's hate. I graft you on his stock to save the stem, To save you from the storm that threatens both! Abs. Should I procure you liberty and life, What pledge could you afford me of your faith, And pure intention to support my claim With all your means? Joab. If I forget my faith And promise pledg'd, you still can reach my life, At least my fame, and at my armies' head Thy voice can blast my fortunes, tho' my flag Stream'd on the walls of Rabbah, and you know My hatred to Uriah! I must leave My deadly rival basking in the beam Of royal favour, and your voice to him (If I deceive you) can at once secure The rule of Israel's bands! Abs. The dye is cast— I free thy body to secure thy mind— But with the strong and viewless bond of souls I first must bind you fast. I go to find The means of your enfranchisement. [Exit. Joab. Why go!— I like thy soaring spirit! but, alas! How shallow to suppose, my schemes possess As little reach as thine! Shall I employ My master-engine, form'd with patient art, To play for children's bidding, to disturb The settled elements, and almost disjoint Both worlds, to mount a bubble on the breeze For fools to laugh at? No—presumptuous boy! Thou didst not feel the still and subtle breath That blew thy flame to such a raging height.— My lungs deny their office, and thy blaze Goes out! The stubble is consum'd that fed The conflagration. Go—Convene thy tribes, Hollow sedition in the general ear, And bid the trumpet of rebellion sound, Emblaze the streaming flag of proud revolt With gorgeous colours of necessity, And exigence of state! I'll aid the king. My loyal trump shall blow a blast so loud, As soon shall drown thy factious minstrelsie, And stun sedition's bands. A fair pretext Thy riot shall afford, to weed the land Of all those rash and fiery volunteers That spend their mouths and bark at royalty This this shall found again my tottering power On adamantine base! the King shall reign My delegate, and I his earthly God— Hark—to the jarring music of yon gate Hail! glorious freedom! hail! unbounded sway!— End of the Third Act. ACT IV. [Scene I.] The Palace. ACHITOPHEL. Was it the fiction of an hideous dream That gave the General to my cheated view Or did that demon, who protects him still Bring him in sight, and waft him hence away To propagate his guilt and force the King And me, on dreadful measures? Must we then Complete the bloody task? does hell's deep gorge Claim her detested sacrifice? behold Those haughty lines, trac'd with a rapid hand, “I have escap'd the snare! thou canst not spread “Cobwebs for eagles. Wouldst thou save thyself “Thou knowst the ransom. Tremble and obey! “Reflect on Abner's fall.” Unheard presumption— —But let me curb my tongue! those walls have ears Those palace-gates, that open'd to his flight Spontaneous, to the viewless hand, that aids His hopes, would close on me, did any word Escape, which courtly malice could distort To treason! well I see, but dare not own I know the hand that freed him! hapless King! Thou too must render up thy stedfast friend To soothe these tygers? or they leap the fence And o'er the fold in devastation range— And, if mistaken tenderness unsteels Thy resolution, thou, or I am lost; Lost in the whirlwind of the General's rage Or in the deep devouring gulf absorpt Of thy proud son's ambition!—all my trust Is only this, that selfish ends will lead The royal rebel, and the haughty chief To foul suspicion of each others views And each will think himself unsafe, unless By force or fraud he fastens on the power Own'd by the other!—Thus, between two storms Of adverse wing, the royal barque may ride Awhile in safety, tho' in giddy whirls Dash'd round and round. This fury of the field We first must sooth, the tyger of the court Is yet unfang'd!—But here the father comes Incenst, yet trembling at the prospect sad Of sure domestic strife! To him, DAVID. David. To thee I owe That here I stand deserted by my friends And, of my God forsaken! Ach. aside. (Thus the guilty And the unfortunate, on others, strive To fling the galling load that weighs them down) My royal master knows, the guard to me Was not permitted! David. Has my son the heart (Unless, by some fell demon of the state Some pupil of left-handed policy Like thee, seduc'd) to meet his Father's rage?— If you revere not Joab, you fear his wrath!— Ach. I therefore wish his fall!— David. I know not that— I know thee subtle, undermining, dark: One, that would worship Moloch for his power And to his burning idol sacrifice The son of thine own bowels! Ach. Tho' I feel The keen reproach, yet to thy grief alone I charge its bitterness!—a cooler moment When your corroding anguish is assuag'd Will tell thee, that had I conniv'd at this I ne'er had staid behind to meet thy rage, But to the General's camp for shelter fled!— The hand, perhaps that freed him, is beyond The seizure of thy power, or claims at least Some spell to ward the tempest from his head. David. —Oh! that my memory could escape that pang!— Thou takest thy time to probe a father's wound When Heaven's deep judgment has disarm'd his hand Else thou hadst not presum'd!—but thou, perhaps Art leagued with both against thy sovereign lord. Ach. opening his breast. Secure my faith at once! the solemn tomb Contains no traitors, and my dust-clos'd ear Will hear no imputations, which my soul Abhors! David. I know not whom, or what to trust? Forgive my rage—forgive a father's anguish To madness driven by the degeneracy And treason of a much-lov'd son—Degeneracy! From whom degenerate? am I not a rebel A rebel to myself, and to my God My country's foe? and can I blame the power That, when I lost the reins of self-command, Let loose this bosom tyger; yet less guilty Than those black passions which laid waste before Each province of the intellectual world, And manacled my reason? I must bear it! Soon too, perhaps, the voice of public shame Will thunder in my ears! My untold crimes, Like deadly exhalations in the gale, Will rise, and poison all the ambient air, Till Nature's self, whose glories once I sung, Will sicken at my name! Ach. That danger yet, I trust, is far remote! David. How can you trust, Or how believe? Does not Uriah feel Bathsheba's guilt? Ach. He keeps in silence still His knowledge, or his doubts. A stronger spell May lead him home. The banquet is begun By your command. The failure of a night, Chance might have caus'd, or some fantastic vow. David O for a prophet's eye, to mark the scenes To-morrow's sun must see! This night, revolving on her ebon throne, Winds up the doom of Bathsheba and me. I cannot bear to ponder on her doom. Ruin'd by me, for me to public shame, Perhaps, to ignominious death expos'd.— On me, me, rather let the tempest fall— I was the tempter, I deprav'd her mind, I blew the embers of a former flame To their first conflagration. Ach. Yet, my lord, All may be well. You tremble at a shade, The coinage of your fancy. If her spouse Can stand the siege of circulating bowls, Of music's charm, and hymeneal songs, Warm as the amorous descant in the grove Of Araby the blest, which to the fair The raptur'd lover chants, as evening draws Around their flowery couch her raven pall; Then is he more than man. But he will melt, The subtle spirit thro' his nerves will thrill, Till his rapt fancy represents his spouse Drest in the bridal robe, while o'er her cheek Soft wishes and soft fears alternate stray! David. Night wears apace, and soon the crisis comes. Go thou and watch his passions how they tend, Whether the bowl has sooth'd his cares asleep, Or drawn the painful secret from his heart. If so, we must prepare to meet the worst. Ach. I go.—[Aside.] (But I have spirits there at work Thou little dream'st of, to unlock the soul, And draw the painful secret forth in storms. The noble savage must be roused to rage, Else he would ne'er be tempted to the snare.) [Exit Achitophel. David Oh! what a torture of suspence I feel, While in the balance of my rival's mind, That plays with every breeze, my doubtful doom Hangs trembling! If resentment steels his soul Against his spouse, to-morrow's rising sun Lights up my shame, and paints my midnight deeds To gazing multitudes! Already Heaven Has left me, and I now must court the power Of reeling madness, in the luscious grape To aid my purpose! To what noxious fiend Must I address my prayer, to cloud the beam Of reason, and before suspicion's eye Hs gaudy tints display, that lead the mind, Like the night-wand'ring sire to seeming safety?— Oh, blessed times! when, thro' the ruffling storm Of fell adversity, that howl'd around, When in each breeze I heard the savage yell Of them that sought my life; against the gale, That seem'd to bear my blasted hopes away, My prayers could gain the steep ascent to Heaven, And draw a beam of comfort from the skies That shot athwart the gloom its vernal ray, And lighten'd all within! Tho' lonely caves Conceal'd my slumbers, and the desart hills Oft saw my midnight steps pursued along By the rude tempest, and relentless man I did not fear you then, my deadliest foes! Seducing demons! who in gaudy shapes Bask in the day-dreams of unruffled life. The air was winnowed then by wholesome gales That shatter'd your fine forms, and bore away The fraudful vision! In the thunder's voice I heard the plaudit of approving Heaven— Even the fierce lightning wing'd my ardent soul Above the conflict of these elements, To scenes of endless peace! Now all is peace Abroad. The deadly feud begins within.— Oh! for his voice again, tho' in the tone Of Heaven's terrific organ, as it spoke With awful voice, yet friendly, to the land Of Egypt! I would hail the welcome sound— Now, like a barque becalm'd, with languid sails, I'm left to slumber on the stagnant wave, While the wild passions rise in rude revolt Against their pilot, whose unprosperous hand So madly trifled with the friendly gale!— I cannot linger thus—Impatience burns For some relief! But soon the crisis comes. The watchful eye of Jealousy may sleep By love, compos'd to rest, and peace return! [Exit. SCENE III. ELIEZER, JONADAB; URIAH—as rising from a banquet. Eliezer. You had his love before—the public voice Now sanctions his—and, on the swelling gale Of popular applause your worth shall mount To heights unthought before! Then, why this caution? This cold reserve? I would not wish the king Should know it, he would deem such cool return But ill beseem'd a friend so nobly try'd In fortune's worst extreme. Uri. Aside. (I see your drift, But I will ward the blow.) Enough, my friends, For temperance—the social rite is paid. Courts are the scenes for revels, mirth, and joy— It is so now at least. There was a time When other maxims rul'd the royal household; But different manners suit with different men.— Here, while the full tide flows of genial joy, And crowns the rosy bowl, it ebbs afar At Rabbah, where the bands of Israel watch The midnight, rude, alarm from Ammon's walls.— It suits not me to banquet, while my friends, Perhaps, in bleak want spend the livelong night, Their convoys by the roving Arab seiz'd— It does not suit a soldier. Jon. If my thoughts Could wander from the present scene, nor camps, Nor ambuscadoes, nor the night-alarm Would claim my contemplation! Other views Of more pacific import, might demand The meditations of a youthful mind. Eliez. Where would your fancy point? Jon. To rosy bowers, And moonlight glades, by gentle whispers led, And beauteous forms, soft stealing from the view, Where no rude trumpet, nor barbarian yell Disturb the sleeping lovers! Uri. Such thefts as these Have often stolen the laurel from the brow Of conquering Israel, and transfixt her shield With hostile javelins; still, where'er we turn'd Our waving banners, our most deadly foes Were found at home! Jon. Aside. What magisterial censure. But he is gall'd—I fear we've gone too far. Eliez. Pardon a jest—the language of our friend Is free—perhaps, his manners not less pure Than those that wear religion's darkest mask. Uri. I own my ignorance, nor yet can learn How, when th'unguarded ear, and roving eye Is open to contagion, by the use Of this too liberal language, from the taint The mind can 'scape. Jon. Plain truth was never So deep a crime before—but I am school'd. Uri. Do you adorn it with the sacred stamp Of manly plainness thus to blazon vice? Eliez. You're too punctilious—form'd of antique mould And wedded to the ways of a republic They fit not monarchies.—those sterner virtues Might suit, perhaps, the camp where Joshua rul'd, Or Gideon.—But the season now is gone! There was a time to mourn and beat the breast 'Tis gone—the storms of winter now are past And jocund May leads on the playful hours.— Uri. Virtue and honour I suppos'd the same— The same their obligations, not to change With cloud or sunshine, like the vernal flower That courts the rising sun, and folds her leaves When night ascends. Eliez. While, like the vigorous stem Of baleful yew, that braves the winter blast You wear your gloomy honours thick upon you And sicken all the sacred train of mirth Around! I envy not such solemn pomp. The blessed sun that warms my mounting blood Points other joys to me!— Uri. The people's voice, The language of misrule, the general cry Of mutiny; do those with soft applause, Immortalize that riot, and excess That cause the intestine plague?—they too proclaim Your vices with like freedom to the world But in a louder tone, and boldly tell, What you conceal, the ruin that attends Such principles. Eliez. That man may preach at ease Of temper'd blood, and boast his self-command Whom heavenly virtue in an angel's form Expects, to bless his honourable toils At home with mutual rapture.— Uri. Now, by Heaven— Did not my honest sword disdain the blood Of such a venom'd sycophant, a reptile Bred in the sunshine of a court, that word Had been your last!—malignant miscreant The sting within that sneer, which fits a fiend In all the triumph of infernal glee Confirms it! cursed be those fatal charms And doubly curst, the guilt-concealing hour When first her broken faith became the theme Of court applause! Jon. What fiend impels you thus Beyond the bounds of reason? say, what proof What test, or knowlege of your spouses guilt? What wretch so busy with a matron's fame As to compel you thus to blast her truth With foulest imputation? Uri. All the skill Of glozing rhetoricians, to conceal Or varnish o'er her guilt, are futile! vain!— If the light gossamer might wrap the limbs Of the fell tyger, or the famish'd pard In lasting bondage; then the flimsy art Of courtiers might controll my waken'd rage!— Jon. Your proofs I know not—all is new to me As my surprize! Uri. It is no common pain That wrings the secret from a soldier's breast Which burns the cheek to tinder, and writes shame Indelible, a foul, stigmatic mark On him and his for ever! Do I live And am I patient underneath my wrongs?— No—earth shall tremble, and high heaven applaud My vengeance! I have proofs, convincing proofs!— Why—honest nature spoke it in her face At her first sight of me! tho' she was school'd Prepar'd, and tutor'd (as it since appear'd) For the encounter! I was warn'd before— And she had drest her looks to scorn surprize But a few searching questions soon brought up The conscious blood to her adulterous cheeks! And she had paid the forfeit on the spot But Heaven restrain'd me! Jon. Have you nought but this! No proof, no evidence? Uri. Yes—proofs on proofs, As soon the sun shall see!— Jon. Forgive—forget! Are you a soldier?—Let your self-command. Proclaim your manhood! Uri. I—shall I forgive? To let contempt pursue my taintless name? Tamely to suffer wrong?—It must not be. Tho' all the vicious court connives at crimes, Uriah shall revenge, tho' yawning hell Should flame across his way! Eliez. And how revenge? You little think how strong an arm is rais'd To guard her threaten'd life! Uri. Altho' the siend Who blasted all my hopes, should take the form Of one, who proudly boasts the royal blood; The Father of his People, would revenge, Altho' the stroke should wound a father's soul! The safety of his throne, his spotless name, Demand the painful task. Jon. Should he deny— Should he, to screen the high-born criminal, Offer unhop'd for honours, and a place Which envy might repine at, and your foes Lament to see, could you support the thought That your blind vengeance had embroil'd the house Of David, and transfixt a father's heart With grief's envenom'd shaft, and burning shame?— Ponder the sad result, before you dip Your foot in blood.— Uri. Will Justice hear the plea? Eternal Justice! will she break her sword Because a father weeps? Will his salt tears Assuage the penal flames, that heavenly wrath Awakes to punish crimes? Heaven to this hand Entrusts her awful cause, and were I false To her eternal trust, the crimes to come Patron'd by this example, would derive Their blackest guilt from me, (should I refuse To draw the delegated sword of vengeance) A soldier's honour, and religion calls, It is the cause of man, the cause of heaven, And by our mighty legislator's soul I will not slumber till I 'venge his laws!— I'll instant to the king, and boldly claim The strumpet's doom, and if the king denies My claim—my country's universal voice, Swell'd to an hurricane, shall echo mine— Ten thousand hands shall drag the culprit hence, Even from the guarded steps of Judah's throne! [Exit Uriah. JONADAB—ELIEZER. Jon. See what a tempest your ungovern'd tongue Has rais'd! Was this a time to gall the wound That rankled in the husband's heart? The king Will on thy folly charge whatever ills May come; my care had mixt a cup of balm To lull the soldier's anguish, and my hand Perhaps, had drawn a soft and gaudy veil Between his mental eye, and those dire scenes That wake his fury. With unhappy hand You tore the curtain down, and gave to view Those hideous images that fire the brain! By Heavens, the King shall know it—not on me The blame shall lie! Eliez. Go! and inform the King Short-sighted man! and are you then to learn Who gave th'ingredients which this skilful hand Dash'd in the soldier's bowl?—their first effect (Like other poisons,) seems ungovern'd rage And furious frenzy; but this stormy gust Will soon fatigue itself, and work its end. The tempest sweeps along the waste of Heaven And seems to drive the baffled vapours on In rude voluminous triumph, but full soon It breathes its rage away—the gloomy foes Rally their files o'er all the shaded sky Surround their victor, and involve his plumes In humid bondage, while the welkin weeps The wild winds durance, in continuous flow. Jon. Explain your mystic words. Eliez. There is no need— The dread event that labours to the birth Shall soon disclose it. Tho' Uriah seems (Exulting in his freedom) to defy The congregated powers of earth and hell, And on the public favour to rely, Yet thro' the waste of night, across the wild, O'er many a desart league of burning sand, All viewless to the eye, the waving snare Extends, which wraps the warrior in its folds. His hands are fetter'd, tho' he feels it not, And soon his silent tongue shall own the spell. Jon. But why provoke his rage? Eliez. The bird, that strives In the fine meshes of the fowler's snare, But binds himself the firmer, and exhausts His little strength in vain! That clamorous rage, That haughty language of insulted honour, These vows of vengeance, and that fiery glance, Whose lightning seem'd to wither all around, Were but the playthings of superior art, That bids the tempest rage, and the rude blast Harrow the sea, and cover any shore We please, with shatter'd wrecks! While we above, From the calm summit of imperial skill, Laugh at the lightnings as they dance along Th'interminable waste of clouds below. This is our triumph, tho' the awful scenes Are yet involv'd in night! Jon. Your words, I fear, Import Uriah's doom; and must he fall? Is there no charm to soothe a husband's rage, But death's eternal sleep! No refuge given But the asylum of the quiet tomb, For his swoln anguish? Eliez. Hear me, and be dumb For ever! He, or thou and I must fall, Should he survive; his wrongs, the people's voice, His claims of public favour, would compel Even David to adopt him, and resign To his stern grasp the rudder of the state. The barque, indeed, might steer in safety on, But we, the ancient leaders of the crew, Must perish, or forsake the lightned keel; His zeal would deem us but the useless lumber Of the disorder'd ship; or, should we 'scape The wreck that threatens from Uriah's pride, We could not stem another deadlier storm, That from another coast of angry heaven, Threatens no less—the general, his sworn foe— Tho' secret, never will forgive the men Who let Uriah 'scape the deadly snare That holds him now—and well you know, his hate Is mortal, as his power is uncontroll'd. I had my orders, else I had not dar'd To rouse the lion's rage. Behold the king!— My task demands me, I must not be found To loiter at this juncture.—Fare thee well.— [Exeunt severally. Scene continues. Enter DAVID and ACHITOPHEL. Ach. Yet he may live;—but royalty must die If he survive; subordination, rule, And order, all must cease! David. Did he disdain The proffer'd honour! Did he scorn the bounty Of him, whose friendship was his noblest pride Of old? Ach. You seem to doubt your faithful servant. If you would condescend yourself to try His temper, and observe the brooding storm Beneath the settled gloom that clouds his brow, Your doubts would end in certainty! David. Alas! I know too much. I heard him threaten loud, And shake the palace with vindictive rage. This is not to be borne! Yet, coward conscience! —I trembled at the menace of my slave As if the thunder lent its awful sound To every accent—what does he resolve? Ach. I know not—thro' the hall that fronts the gate He roams disturb'd, and often smites his brow Then calls on friendship, and arraigns the name Of hapless love! David. Did any word or sign When the freed soul was strip'd of its disguise And spurn'd all danger from a mortal foe Seem then to point at me? Ach. Not, as I heard— He rather seem'd on you to place his trust. David. The torture of the fiends is in the thought! Generous, believing man! altho' I know That whatsoever sycophant disclos'd His consort's lapse, with keen malignant joy Pointed at me, yet, tardy of his faith My friend, my injur'd friend! believ'd him not! Why will he rush on danger thus and brave Perdition for the sake of doubtful vengeance I cannot, must not hurt him! I have sinn'd Beyond redress already—I must save him! Ach. aside. I'm lost, if he relents!—My royal Lord Trust not appearance—he may know too much Tho' with such art his knowlege he conceals, Design'd, perhaps, to throw you off your guard And give him means to strike the surer blow) Your noble nature flings a gorgeous veil Of seeming excellence before your sight! Thro' your own matchless medium you behold The characters of others. Every tint Of your own genuine virtues, on their shadows Reflected falls, and gilds the vapours o'er (Like evening's watry vest!) with fluid gold! Dost thou suppose Uriah's soaring soul Can stoop to wrongs, and to a woman's fall Limit his daring? He has other views! Go to the senate! to the crowded camp! You see his footsteps like a stormy god Thro' the tumultuous waves: across the wild And o'er the burning sand, Uriah's name Loads the full gale: from Arnon's distant shore To Salem's towers, the thorough-fare of Heaven On its broad bosom wings from clime to clime The magic syllables! the common herd Nay, even the reverend Sanhedrim proclaim The seeming virtues, which adorn the robe That hides his dark ambition!—do you doubt?— Doubt on! till faction and revolt o'erturns The steady balance of imperial power!— David. His guilt at least is dubious—mine is certain I'll own it—ask forgiveness—well I know His generous nature!— Ach. Did you ever know This generous friend forsake his first resolve?— I grant his nobleness of mind as high As e'er upheld the diadem, or rod Of regal sway: will he consent to soil His taintless honours with degrading shame And live, a breathing monument of scorn?— He would not for this kingdom! He'll revenge His wrongs on you, or her. David. Did not my fall Involve a people, I would much prefer My fall to hers—for oh! whatever power In love's soft name has fasten'd on my heart There, there it domineers! the purple tide That warms my veins, is not more native there!— Nor does the watry waste obey the moon With more subjection. Ach. You must learn to bear Her loss!—But that is small—you must already Have own'd the call of Prudence to resign her To her first Lord—already you have felt The cruel, deep divorce!—the second pang Will not be half so poignant as the first! David. Too deep I feel the bitter irony!— I know his proud integrity would scorn To mingle with contagion!—Hell reward The man, that told the secret! But for him All had been well! Ach. We only now must toil For the best possible! among the worst There is a choice of evils; when the hope Of good is gone already! well I know (Or my old observation quite has fail'd) There's danger in the man! His smooth address His favour with the populace, denote Sinister meaning—His attractions draw Like the sun's influence to the point of noon The wat'ry vapours, till his stores are full And then the deluge comes and drowns the world. David. I cannot think it! Ach. Confiding in his pity! He perhaps May grant forgiveness and again receive His consort to his bosom—No—by Heaven He ne'er will do it; were there nought besides To steel his resolution but the fear Of losing popular favour, should his baseness Be known as it must be!—at least surmise Would construe all the honours he might gain To shameful bribes for silence and consent. A man may oft be injur'd in his bed While it's unknown, and may be still a man— If he consents, and looks upon the theft With undistinguishing, cool apathy He is no more a man, but a vile slave— An idiot:—such Uriah ne'er was deem'd David. A dreadful aggravation of my crime! All this, in horrible detail I saw Ere my first lapse, a certain consequence— And yet I fell—tho' leisure was allow'd For full deliberation, and the damp Of cold presage, that chill'd me to the heart Might well have bid th'unhallow'd ardour cool— I persever'd, and now I must go on Or perish by retreat: a stable stand On those deluding, slippery paths of vice Is not allow'd. Ach. Can you resign her? David. Never!— She lives an inmate here! Even Nature's voice Declares her born for me, and me for her!— Ach. Make her for ever thine. David. But how? Ach. All men Are mortal, and the shaft that flies by day Or pestilence, that walks the gloom of night May reach their lives! David. Ha! Belial! name it not! The thought is madness! must adultery then Be cloaked by murder? Ach. Think Bathsheba lost, Fallen, fallen a victim to the Judge's doom You live a victim to the public scorn Perhaps, dethron'd and exil'd! that is small.— David. What worse? exile with her, could she be sav'd Were—but I rave!—some frenzy fires my brain! Must I, by merit rais'd, when haughty Saul Had fallen from Heaven's protection, thus abuse The gift? Ach. I own, in thee religion lives Thy fall involves her ruin, on thy head The solemn fabric sinks, with all its pomp And Israel's veneration, turn'd with toil From idols, like the tide that bursts its bounds Reverts with violence to its former course— A single life prevents it!— David. What a life! Ach. When Abraham and Jephthah first resolv'd To sacrifice their children, was there nought To wring the bosom, or to melt the heart? And what induc'd them, but religion's cause? What seal'd the father's vow? religion's cause. He for religion's cause a daughter slew You scruple to resign a dangerous man Whose life protracted, threats the very soul Of state,, religion, and your life itself!— For when it threats your life, it threatens all! Religion's being on your life depends! —You must acquire more fortitude, or sink Beneath your numerous foes! David. I must not think. Ach. There is no time for thought—resolve at once— Dost thou not wish the obstacle remov'd By any safe expedient?—Search thy heart— Examine well within! I know thou dost— But Heaven, that marks the movements of the mind, In equal balance weighs the guilty deed, And guilty thought! Already is thy mind Deep stain'd with blood, in Heaven's impartial eye, And sentence past already. What remains But give th'imperial mandate—and 'tis o'er— One act of penitence atones for all. David And must I yield against my better sense?— My reason reels, and all within is doubt. Ach. No choice is given, but everduring shame, Or one decisive blow, that lops away The noxious plant that shades your nobler views. It is a public cause, the cause of kings, Of Israel! And shall private cares pervent That necessary doom, which public love Demands? Can you resolve to suffer shame, (The last of ills! which angels scarce can bear) To see the tribes assembled to thy fall, Like some stern woodman's train, whose sturdy strokes Assail the noblest plant of all the grove, Till, overcome by many a ruthless blow, It bows th'aerial head and sweeps the ground? Will you encounter this, and live to see Some alien stem transplanted in your room. Some Gentile god, with solemn rites abhorr'd, Expell the dread of Israel from his shrine?— Such things must be, if to the rising gust Of popular fury stern Uriah joins His vengeful clamours—should he send around The dreadful tokens of a husband's wrath, Thro' each astonish'd tribe, as he of old, Judges c. 20. Who turn'd the torrent of a people's rage On one devoted town, and sacrific'd A slaughter'd people for a wife abus'd; What were the consequence?—Wild anarchy, And nameless horrors! Law, religion, form, And loyalty, all trampled under foot. Bathsheba's sprinkled blood will rouse the flame To tenfold rage, whose fury will involve The palace and her king! But here, behold! The victim comes, from thine own lips, to hear Her sentence. David. Save me, save me from her eyes They flash the vengeance of insulted Heaven. Ach. introducing Bathsheba. Look on the vengeance of insulted Heaven! And think—will Heaven permit a form like this To plead in vain—she flies to thee for refuge. [Exit Achitophel. David. Bathsheba! oh—was this a time to claim An interview? or art thou come to see The double triumph of thy fatal charms Over thy husband and thy King at once? He domineers below, and thou art come To charge me with your wrongs—is this an hour To add new aggravation to a load That bends me to the ground? Bath. Our shame and woe Are mutual, but, my Lord! you much mistake The purpose of my coming at this hour Of danger and distress! I know my guilt I feel what self-infliction wounds within, Yet still some inborn dignity remains, Yet undeprav'd, still some regard to truth And justice, which for ever locks my lips From charging on thy soul this fatal lapse (Fatall to me!)—I come to ease thy care Andre ason down the conflict in thy soul! David. Then—I have drawn within the bounds of guilt And cureless sorrow, this distinguish'd mind This generous spirit, which disdains to charge The cruel spoiler, with her deadly wrongs!— For this, Bathsheba! I was not prepar'd!— Rather pursue me with thy keen reproach Charge me with all the guilt! a manly mind Should have repell'd the foe, not sunk, like me To childish weakness! I was steel'd within But I flung off the armour of the mind Before the danger came!— Bath. It was surprize— A smother'd passion, by a sudden spark Rais'd to a conflagration, which o'ercame All obstacles—that conquest o'er yourself When with a trembling hand, and bleeding heart You first resign'd me to your chosen friend: (Too well I mark'd, and never can forget Your pangs that moment, when you lost me first Resign'd me, like a martyr to your honour!) —That was a glorious tryal, whose desert Should sooth your present woes!—ah! would to Heaven! Thy friend had caught the godlike zeal of friendship That warm'd thy bosom then! I had not now Been doom'd to sate his vengeance with my blood He took th'advantage of a solemn vow By a stern father's will impos'd before And well—too well he knew, my father's will Was his sole claim!—he ne'er possess'd my heart— And when a nobler interest warm'd my breast, It was not like a soldier, nor a friend To seize th'unwilling hand! David. He was my friend For me he risqu'd his life, and, tho' to part From thee, was then a summons, like the stroke Of death, I own'd not then that selfish mind To rob my fellow-soldier and my friend Of such a gem, beyond the wealth of Kings To buy.—But pardon me—this language now Must be renounc'd for ever! Bath. Too, too well I know the sad necessity. But hear At least a palliation of thy fault From her, who feels her own, nor fears to add A share of that, which, to yourself unjust You claim, a debt which Heaven too clearly sees Is due to me, and what my life must pay.— I blame not him, altho' it look'd like coldness That such a length of time unheeded past, And yet his spouse he claim'd not, from the hand Which first bestow'd her.—Did he seem to prize The present when it came? a few short months Had seen me wedded, when the trumpet's call Lur'd him from love and the soft lap of peace, Tho' no invasion shook our trembling bounds And our indulgent legislator's voice To the new-wedded pair had given a year Unvext by wars alarms! David. It prov'd at least His love of fame and of his King's renown! Bath. I too could give my life for Israel's cause, To purge the taint affronted pride disdains From his imperious mind, who slighted me Who flung me, like a worthless toy, away Nor thought it worth a lordly husband's pains To throw away a few neglected hours To gain a consort's heart, too cold before! Yet to his vengeance I must pay my life, Whose scorn the seeds of alienation sow'd The source of all my woes! yet this is well! Since, ere suspicion singles out my Lord The tomb shall close on me, and bury all— Deep, deep below the busy fiend shall rest Whose obloquy might reach the royal name Did I survive! David. And you—must you atone —(Less guilty far,) for my more deadly crimes It must not, shall not be!— Bath. The law's demands Must be obey'd—they claim a forfeit life.— David. No palliation, no excuse allow'd For one whose fatal fall, her spouses fault Perhaps alone had caus'd? Bath. So human laws Ordain—perhaps in other worlds than this In the great tribunal that sifts the heart Distinction may be made between the tinge Of guilt and weakness! David. I, alas! was chosen Heaven's delegate (had I deserv'd the name, This ne'er had been!) I ought—but now 'tis late— To have display'd at once my sovereign power To solve this dark enigma of your fate But, self-involv'd in guilt, I durst not move Left hissing scorn, and obloquy, combin'd Should hurl me from the throne! Bath. Would Heaven, my doom Were past! then all would end, and peace return To your perturbed spirit. [Going. David. Stay—oh Heaven!— Must she submit to fate? whose generous mind Would hazard all for him, who caus'd her fall? It must not, cannot be!—Nature exclaims Resistless, raging, in the cause of her Who reigns in every pulse! yet, go—send in [Ex. Bath. Achitophel to me, his keen research May find some specious means to reconcile My fighting duties! oh unhappy fall! Other asylums I was us'd to find In my distress, while I had trust in Heaven! —I now must trust to man. Enter ACHITOPHEL. David. Achitophel! Is there no port! no refuge from this storm That menaces so loud? Ach. The storm is o'er Uriah waits your orders to the camp Ere morn he must depart! David. Why thus prevent The dawn? Ach. I know not, but conjecture lends Her glimmering lamp that throws a dubious ray On the dark purpose of the warriour's mind. David. Tell what you fear at once! Ach. In two days hence The Judge of life and death ascends his seat —This will afford him space to reach the camp To sound revolt among his partizans Then, with the expedition of a bolt That, glancing from the shiver'd rock, o'erthrows The blasted tree, his fiery-footed haste Will chace his hapless consort to the grave! David. Ha! is it so—it bears a dreadful form Of something like the truth! Ach. Resolve, my Lord! This is no time for pause! Bathsheba's doom Is fixt already, past thy power to ward If he returns. David. How knowst thou that? explain!— Ach. Too well—a friend of his has borne the scroll To Zadoc. David. Prove it! Ach. Oh my Lord! is this A time to search for proofs, or is my faith No better known?—when he returns, the proofs Will come in thunder, when redress is past!— —Nay more, the malecontents, who lurk'd of late In corners, meet in crowds, and waft the sound Of clamorous obloquy from band to band, Their slanders spare not even the royal name! They only want a leader to assert The baffled claims of Benjamin's proud race! David. This is but rumour still! Ach. But I have proofs Authentic, strong,—I found the means to stop The hasty messenger, till morning dawn And gain'd the parchment. [Shews a Parchment. See! 'tis sign'd and seal'd Even with Uriah's hand—yet trust my word— Such is the influence of thy haughty subject Not in your camp alone, but in your courts Even in your family, I found it hard To gain the proof, and was compell'd to use A statesman's art, where statesmens' power was vain!— His partizans are numerous, mighty, proud All friends of old democracy, and sworn Under that venerable name, to rend The sceptre from thy hand, or chuse a King Subservient to their views, and close confin'd Within their new-made limits. David. He, that gave Can keep the sceptre mine! but we must find Some means to save the state. Ach. To save thyself And all that's dear. David No more—we must contrive To setter headlong rage—nor risque our all At jealousy's demand, or faction's frown, The means shall be resolv'd upon within. [Exeunt. Scene—Another part of the Palace. URIAH—ADRIEL. Uri. And is it thus the King has learnt to treat His early friends? It was not so of old! —Sent for in haste, exalted with vain hope Of freedom from this tyrant of the camp Whom now I serve—then!—what a deadly blank For all the comforts of domestic joy I felt at home—the royal presence barr'd By sycophants against the monarch's friends Yet that were well! but this unheard-of wrong!— —What?—am I grown a savage of the wild To be thus baited by the last of men The rabble of a court?— Adr. Compose your rage And take your measures coolly! Uri. I will find A passage to the King, or lose myself,— Soon shall I know, if he allows his friends —The partners of his glory, to submit To such a welcome!—were I call'd my friend! Among my foes, like Sampson, to make sport By my blind gambols! I could bear it well— —But, to be hoodwink'd thus among my friends Expos'd to all the ridicule and sneer Of scorners, who would tremble at my frown Were they to meet me in another field— —This is not to be borne!—thou too, my friend Contrivest to hold the veil upon my eyes And keep me blindfold here, among the rest! Adr. Why dost thou stay then in this dangerous place Where, to provoke and sting thee into rage And make thee do some deed of lunacy To draw on thee perdition from the King Is all they wish for? They have miss'd their ends To lure thee to the snare, and now, they try To rouse thy rage, and drive thee to the toils— Art thou, like Sampson, blind amongst thy foes?— —Then, be a Sampson! pull the fabric down! And whelm them in the ruin. Uri. Talk no more In riddles, but explain! Adr. Thou seest the hand Of royalty, extended to protect The guilty—of thyself they meant to form An engine, a machine, to cloke their schemes, And sooth the tongue of obloquy to rest— —You 'scap'd the snare, and now, they doom you dead— —You ne'er will bear your life to Rabbah's camp— —But—if you stay Oh—there is noble vengeance yet in store! Which not a single voice, nor single arm Can claim or execute.—Tell your wrongs loud In Israel's ear, and echo shall reply From every wood around, where freedom waits The word to start, and over hill and dale Pursue the noble chace till lawless power Forsakes our happy bounds, and breathes her last.— Uri. Thou hast indeed disclosed An unexpected scene!—and must I be Either an instrument of private guilt Or the blind tool of faction? am I made The trumpet of rebellion, or the flute That breathes soft peace thro' every royal room Of guilty courts?—at least, my sovereign Lord Will not deny me justice, which alone I seek for—but, my scandal to proclaim To blaze my wrongs before the noontide beam Is, what the honour of a soldier's name Or bosom, cannot brook!—and, must I give My breath to blow sedition's flame abroad And in sad triumph celebrate my wrongs, With flaming villages and bloody fields And devastation and ungovern'd rage?— No—let me do my duty, as becomes A soldier. I will ne'er be a machine Of the blind rabble's fury—if the shaft Of unseen death should meet me by the way Sent from my public or my private foes, Vengeance is heaven's—and what on earth have I Or to regret, or grieve!— Adr. That you mistake My upright meaning, much afflicts thy friend! —I could discover more!—but thy warm zeal Perverts whate'er I say!—I much could wish My doubts unfounded, but I fear for thee— Consent at least to take a guard of friends To bring you hence in safety to the camp (If any sudden mandate should be given To haste thy journey in the gloom of night) For certain treason then shall dog thy heels— But they shall guard you, and, perhaps, detect Some mysteries yet untold, whose weight may turn The scale for freedom in that dubious breast And echo from her woodlands, shall repeat Ten thousand fold, the soul-enliv'ning strain. Uri. No private wrongs shall make me lend my name To public mischief—for the rest—my friends I would not wish endanger'd for my sake— The law shall right me! or farewell, revenge! Adr. No danger need be fear'd, but from yourself If you too tamely bear such flagrant wrongs— I'll tell you more, expect me here anon. [Ex. severally. End of the Fourth Act. ACT V. The Palace. DAVID. Not yet return'd! 'tis strange! they could not miss The track, nor would they linger in the chace!— —The morning dawns, but all is dark within. Ye solemn glooms! and thou still midnight hour Whence were your secret hoards of vengeance drawn That thus could fire my brain, and people night With forms, that made me wish for whisper'd tales Of ambuscades, of massacres, and blood To slake the kindling plague that burns within! —Perhaps they have deserted me, and join'd The foe! O coward reason! how you reel!— They have discover'd all, and he returns Returns, full fraught with vengeance, like a plague To breathe his venom round in every breast Till royalty expires, and David's name That us'd to fill the plausive shouts of thousands Is breath'd in execration, stamp'd with shame! I now repent the step, and wish recall'd The messengers of mercy—never more Will he consent to pass those guilty gates Again! perhaps, his rash, mistaken valour May deem them blood-hounds, meant to lure him back To certain fate, and stand on his defence! But they were far too numerous to be foil'd!— Or force or supplication must prevail— I should have kept him here! my good resolves Are now the sport of chance! for, if he 'scapes Not all the world can save him! But, alas! Should he return, can I endure his look? Can I endure to see his lovely spouse Thro' gazing multitudes led to her fate? Ah no—tho' shame and ruin should ensue I would defy the law, profane the court And boldly rescue her, or lose myself!— He then must fall—for, should he now return What plea could I invent to screen my plot Of death against him? He would still suspect The man, who once could give him up to fate!— I know his noble nature, he would scorn To hold his life on such precarious terms! Revenge and fear at once would urge him on To join the faction, and embroil the state!— Had I upon his loyalty rely'd!— I knew his nature noble and forgiving— But now, it is too late!—and, could I bear To lose her?—never—never—tho' the voice Of thunder, call'd her from me! then farewell Remorse! farewell compunction—she is mine! —But now my palpitating heart informs me The crisis is at hand—my valiant friend. Enter BENAIAH. Say, are the messengers return'd? Ben. Not yet At least, not all. David. Some dreadful chance, I fear Has interven'd. What mean your dubious words At least not all? Ben A direful chance indeed! The messenger that came, has scarce escap'd With half a life! David. What sad reverse is this! How could he cope with odds! or what bold arm Was join'd with his? Ben. A numerous band of friends Rous'd by some rumour of an ambuscade, By Joab prepar'd against his threaten'd life Triumphant led him thro' the opening gate And tend him to the camp!—your messengers Arriving at this moment, when surmise Teem'd with intended murders, perfidy And midnight plots—were deem'd the ruffian train Combin'd to lay the noble warriour low; Then all was clamour and misgovern'd rage In vain Uriah strove to lay the storm— Twice fifty level'd swords at once surround Your friends, who plead their innocence in vain One dar'd to menace vengeance, but the threat Was fatal to the wretch that gave it breath, His hapless fellows shar'd his bloody doom Save one, whom favouring night, (tho' wounded sore) Befriended in his flight, from him was learn'd The dreadful chance! David. Then to his doom he goes!— Fate has him in the snare, and baffles all Our vain attempts to save him! O for a winged messenger of Heaven To reach the camp at Rabbah, and instill Unusual pity in the General's mind!— But they, whose ready ministry of old Turn'd from my hunted steps the deadly foe And render'd me as viewless as themselves Have all forsaken me—nor am I left Alone. Remorse and guilt, and death, and shame With dragon wing o'ershade me in their turns Their harpy clang severe, and funeral yell Proclaim perdition to my trembling soul! Amazement! Nathan here! I thought him fled For ever from his country, to avoid The killing sight of an ungrateful child!— Him, last of all mankind, I wish'd to meet! What terrible tranquility pervades His reverend mien and seems to threat a storm— Would that were all! this deadly calm is worse Where nought but sense of Heaven's desertion lives! To him NATHAN. David. Prophet, why didst thou thus forsake thy post Still deem'd the guardian of thy country's weal? Nath. The times are not the same! those cares are o'er Domestic woes have quench'd the patriot's flame! No more my bosom kindles at the touch Of Heaven's descending fire! the port is clos'd That show'd my ravish'd eyes the splendid view Of ages yet to come! How soon the veil May rise, I know not! what the sun beholds Those aged eyes can see, but boast no more The power to pierce the midnight-woven gloom In which the cause and consequence are hid!— David. This studied ambiguity implies A meaning, which thy humble words disclaim! Nath. When such unerring wisdom guides the helm Form'd like the diamond in the pregnant mine With that deep lustre fraught, those mingling beams Which angels love to gaze on! when the soul Reflects Heaven's image like the limpid lake Smooth, and unruffled, by fell passion's gale; A private man it much would misbecome To play the pilot, and usurp the helm From such consummate guidance.—But for me No such ambitious folly taints my views Judge by my errand! on a private cause I come, a suppliant only—With the state And all its cares, I long have shaken hands, Content to introduce a poor man's plea To your indulgent ears—for well I know Tho' to the dangerous claim of passion deaf Tho' to the domineering proud appeal Of appetite, thou turn'st a heedless ear And look'st on sensual spells with cool regard Yet wilt thou not contemn the suppliant's prayer! David. With the known rigour of thy stern rebuke Such lavish adulation ill accords— The humble topic of a poor man's plea Needs no such pompous prelude.—I suppos'd My known contempt of flattery might suggest (To thee at least) a manlier mode of speech Unless thy words and meaning are at strife. Nath. I stand corrected, and shall err no more, Nor mingle with my rough uneven woof The tissue of the courtier's silken strain! It suits not with a plain, pathetic tale Of rural violence and village wrongs Which thy paternal care shall soon redress When known. When from the bounds of Salem late I past Self-exil'd, to avoid domestic woe I thought in some sequester'd vale to find That peace and innocence devoid of guile Which (tho' thy bright example beams around) Even in those sacred bounds are sought in vain, A peasant's lodge I sought, whom long I knew Of Heaven so favour'd in his mean retreat So sanctify'd, that his æthereal guard Kept from his lonely cot, at distance due All the vain Images, the gaudy train Of Syren forms (this world's peculiar boast) That lures the heedless votary from Heaven. David. Could they not guard him from oppressive wrong? Nath. They saw him wrong'd, and yet th'oppressor lives. This hermit for my host I rather chose Than the proud owner of a neighb'ring pile Who kept his hospitable gate unclosed With oftentatious welcome to allure The way-worn pilgrim's foot—But here instead Of the long retinue, that fills the haunts Of luxury, and the unmeaning phrase Of hollow friendship, warm in words alone, One gentle lamb, his single inmate play'd About his joyous hearth and told a tale Of warm attachment in its honest looks And gentle bleatings, far beyond the phrase Of courtly adulation. This remain'd The solitary orphan of a flock Which fell contagion, or the fellor gripe Of lawless usury had reft away The rest, or fill'd the concert of the vales Which own'd his wealthier neighbour for their Lord Or bled, by turns, the victims of his board. David. That wealthy neighbour shall refund his store If aught of inhumanity appears Before the Judges tribunal—for soon It shall be closely sifted,—but proceed!— Nath. A stranger, to the camp of Israel bound Of seeming rank, tho' hid in close disguise The proud man's hospitality had claim'd, He spar'd his numerous flocks, and sent his hinds To robb the hermit of his bleating friend The sole associate of his lonely hours.— I saw it borne away—I mark'd the tears Of its sad owner, all in vain they fell In vain, with supplications he pursued Even to the proud man's door his innocent charge His whole redress was insult, scorn, and blows.— David. Now Heaven so deal with me, as he shall reap The bitter fruit of an unfeeling heart And with his forfeit life redeem the land From such a foul contagion! soon the world Shall know, I do not bear the sword in vain! Nath. In thee, my Lord, whose pure, unsullied life Reflects a glowing transcript of Heaven's laws Such rigour is becoming, but to us Whose feeble optics boast no angel's ken The sword of justice dazzles as it strikes— There needs not such gigantic force to venge Such petty wrongs. You know, my Lord! how long the penal sword Has slumber'd in the sheath, and it might seem The rigour of severity, at once To wake its terrours now, for fame would tell That for a petty wrong, which might be paid Four fold, a soul was forfeit! David. Strange to me It seems, that thou, whose eagle-sight could pry Beyond the journies of the sun, to view The late effect that slumber'd in its cause, Should be dim-sighted here! but time and grief Have shed a frost upon your faculties Else you would see, that famine, sword and fire With all the woes that on those furies wait Are not so pestilent as that still plague That cold, narcotic vapour, worst of ills With which hell teems, that last result of vice, When all the virtues, poison'd in their source, Stagnate at once, and petrify the heart.— Heaven's! what a journey with his fellow fiends Thro' every devious tract of every crime This man must first have run, who thus could tear The fellow-feelings from his savage heart! His soul is gangren'd, and the sword alone Can ward the vengeance stor'd above the sky Which else, perhaps, would burst upon our heads In flaming ruin; or the plague might catch From bosom on to bosom.—He, who dar'd To seize the lamb, would he have spar'd the child To join his servile train, or change for gold, As pride or caprice, or the thirst of gain Had chanc'd to domineer? Nath. Yes—or his spouse! David. Ha! Nath. Thou art the man! why does thy cheek turn pale At thy own semblance? was the mask so foul As even to wake thy rage: and art thou dumb When thou behold'st the phantom's genuine face? Thine own most righteous doom has past thy lips Without recall, and heaven has seal'd the word! To punish other crimes, were but to prune The wild luxuriance of a poisonous growth, While the pernicious root behind remains, Royal example! David. after a long pause. Then thy flight was feign'd And thou who seem'd degraded from thy post As Heaven's own delegate, by Heaven's own hand. With all thine honours blasted on thy brow, Return'st with tenfold power, and seem'st to wield The bolt of vengeance, but thy forward zeal May be th'effect of petulance; the lamp Of Heav'n no more may show its light by thee; Perhaps, 'tis merely to indulge thy spleen, That thus you dare to thwart me. Nath. Judge yourself, When that fell adder, which you foster now, Such gratitude will show, as you have shown To Heaven! My son's rebellion, and my flight, Were mystic warnings to the mental eye Of tragic scenes to come! Of wild misrule, And nameless horrours, even within those walls To be committed. These will clear my faith, And vindicate my name. But who, alas! Who shall exculpate thee? Thou who wast call'd From a rude scene of turbulence and blood, Like yon emerging sun from chaos old, Th'interpreter of Heaven's benignant will From thy bright station to revive the world With intellectual light! What demon's hand Has chang'd thee to a comet, worse than they Who wave their blazing tresses o'er the globe, Shedding diseases and sidereal blast? Thou hast, as far as thou hast power, derang'd The blest designs of Heaven, eclips'd her light With deep Egyptian darkness, and reduc'd Her order to confusion! Thou hast given A louder note to Passion's loudest storm, And strengthen'd all her pleas! For who that feels Her mutinous demands, but well may plead David's example for his worst offence; David, selected by applauding Heaven Her delegate, her prophet, and her priest?— The faithful husband, of his spouse bereft, Heart-wounded sires, who mourn the cruel hand That robb'd his family of all its grace And comfort, lost at once, shall join to curse Thy mournful triumphs o'er connubial bliss, Shall curse thy name, whose magic syllables Breath'd, as a vile apology for crimes, Could, like a deep and powerful charm, compose The loud complaints of conscience! David. Oh, no more! Thou rendst my very heartstrings! I have sinn'd, Beyond redemption sinn'd. O send in haste To save Uriah. Nath. It is now too late.— Even should thy messenger in time arrive, Should the swift mandate reach the general's hand It would but hasten brave Uriah's doom, Such is his deadly jealousy of all That share thy favour, thy solicitude To save him, would be thought a close design To hurl him from his post, by murther bought, And fix the hated rival in his room.— Even Providence ordains that he shall fall. Guilt must have all its dreadful consequence, No single plague of all its ghastly train Shall lagg behind. The whole Tartarean pomp Shall march in horrour o'er the frighted world, To shew the perils of beginning vice: The dreadful admonition else were vain.— Think not to save him! Thou hast doom'd him dead, And even Omnipotence has seal'd his fate. David. Is there no means to save him? Nath. Do you doubt My mission still? This moment gives a proof That makes me shudder, while a stronger power Compells my trembling hand to rend the veil. See there! [Vision of a Man in a mask appears. A youth without a name! He boasts thy blood. Wrapt in unholy musings how he walks! His eyeballs seek the dust, as if he fear'd Each glance should tell the fires that burn within, And soon the dust shall drink his boiling blood, And vengeance quench the flame!—Stand close, and mark His dire soliloquy! Nor shalt thou learn The object of his flame! for Heaven's behest Must not be stop'd or thwarted, else the close Of vice, would want its horrours!—Here he comes. The PHANTOM Speaks. Why was I form'd with such impetuous passions Oh ill star'd lot of royalty, indulg'd In every wish! the fuel feeds the flame Till raging past all bounds, it finds its way Even to the sanctuary! Ye chaste stars! I must not name her to you! Even my heart Treacherous, and inconsistent, with itself At that lov'd name recoils!—yet urges on My feet to find my doom!—yet, why recoil? No husband's forfeit blood I mean to shed, To meet him with a smile and, with a smile Dismiss him, with the mandate of his fate— I dare not reach the mark of Viz. David. Heaven's-belov'd My crime is short of murther, tho' beyond Common adultery! and if Heaven connives At David's crimes, his complicated guilt, Why should I doubt of pardon, while my sin Is secret, nor involves the guilt of blood? (If pardon be required, and right and wrong Perhaps, whatever priestcraft may devise— Be not the coinage of a statesman's dream) I'll think no more!—the genial feast invites I go to drown reflection in the bowl. David. Who is this monster? oh disclose his name By swift prevention to arrest the course Of such consummate crimes! Nath. It cannot be— He boasts thy blood, and, as thou seest pursues Thy steps—you err'd from appetite alone, While he, improving on the royal crimes Turns passion into principle, but soon Vengeance shall cut him short, and lop away One deadly limb of that malignant plant Thy crimes have sown in Israel. David. I adore Heaven's ways, nor dare to deprecate her wrath! Nath. But other scenes await thee.—Spectacles Of wider horrour, and more general plagues When for one lawless deed, a nation mourns; And slaughter, fire, and devastation strides From province into province, led to spoil By vengeance, vengeance for a monarch's crimes, Where pure religion and her votaries Are banish'd from the clime by vice disgrac'd. Arise ye tribes unborn! ye future scenes Distant, and indistinct in time and place Behind the convex of the world conceal'd And on the buoyant bosom of the air Expand your figur'd pomp, and meet the eye!— Far distant from those shores, a warlike race That mark the wheels of the descending sun Shall Conversion of the Spaniards to Christianity. see another luminary rise On their benighted souls, from Salem sent, From Hermon to Pyrenes distant bourne Wide flushing o'er the sky. The savage tribe Shall doff the bloody mail, and bathe their limbs In pure baptismal waters, where the stream Of Guadiana laves the fertile fields.— Long shall their tribes enjoy the deep serene Of rural bless, beneath their Lords renown'd Of The Gothic Settlers in Spain. Alemannia's old heroic race, Till peace induces luxury and vice, The court begins the example, taught by thee, (When thy prophetic eye, that us'd to pierce Thro' the long vistas of futurity, Forgot its visions, for th'unholy glance That led to deeds of darkness and of blood) The monarch Roderic, the Goth, whose seduction of Count Julian's daughter, occasioned the invasion of Spain by the Moors. lets his eye at random rove After forbidden charms, forgets the tye Of hospitality, and leaves the sire To weep at home his violated child; His tears are treasured up above; they fill The vial of Heaven's vengeance, and come down In showers of wrath. The raging sire, misled By the vindictive fiends, ascends the deck, And to his country's foes a suppliant bends! See where the reverend senior kneels before The misbeliever's throne, but not for peace, For mercy he implores not, but demands The congregated furies of the south, Fire, sword, and famine, to revenge his wrongs. See! where they scowl across the midland main, And meditate their prey, and mount the wind! A living cloud of mischiefs, worse than those “Which Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day, “Brought up, and darken'd all the land of Nile.” The Vision of a Royal Court appears. The King on his throne, and his Nobles attending. Enter a SUPPLIANT, and kneels. [SUPPLIANT] To thee, dread sovereign of an hundred thrones, Who sees the swarthy sons of Lybia bend Before thee, and canst bid their headlong zeal Sweep o'er the subject nations, or subside, Like the wild hurricanes that rage or sleep At the great bidding of the power who rules The kingdom of the winds: if ever zeal In thy great Mahomet. prophet's cause thy sabre drew, If ere the wrongs of yon proud Christians so called by the Sarazens. Nazarenes Enflam'd your rage, oh! seize the golden hour, That zeal and vengeance sanctify at once, Or sleep for ever! Now the martial sife No more accords the measur'd march; no more The trumpet's clang awakes the levied horde, But o'er the blasted laurels of their groves Vice curls her reptile tendrils, and consumes The vital sap, that nurs'd the vig'rous stem!— The king repays the hospitable rite With violence and wrong! His nobles view His mad career in heartless apathy, Or join his deadly orgies! What remains, But up—and give the victim to the sword.— Nature is burden'd with the hated race, And Heaven's own ministers, that ride the clouds, To all the winds proclaim the harvest ripe. Go borrow Time's keen scythe, and lend its edge To Devastation's hand; the reverend sire Will shake his hoary locks with joy to see His task of ages, in one glorious day Perform'd, then everlasting Righteousness Will look from Heav'n, and bless the rising flame That lays the temples of Gomorrah low!— Seek ye an hostage? take my life in pledge, If I should fail on yonder hated coast To give you ample means to plant your power And bid the Mauritarian stem extend Its boughs luxuriant o'er the conquer'd land! King. Fathers! attend the summons! Heaven itself Calls us to conquest, and o'er haughty Spain Our prophet's name to raise, our hallow'd arms Are cover'd o'er with dust, and want a cause To furbish them anew. Shall narrow seas Oppose their march, whom Barca's burning sand Withheld not, burning fiercer in pursuit Of glory? think, for every added realm A double weight of glory waits above To every one, whose arms have lent their aid To this victorious cause Viz. The cause of Mahomet.. Begin the vote. The Prospect changes to an invaded Country—Cities in Flames— Peasants Massacred, &amp;c. &amp;c. Nath. Behold the fruit of thy luxurious hours, The sequel of thy fond Elysian dreams! That King who dar'd to violate the laws Of sacred hospitality and friendship Bred in religion's pure and sacred rites Had never dar'd to brave the flaming bolt, Nor cope with Heaven's dread edict, hadst not thou Marshall'd the way before! contemplate now The dreadful harvest which thy hand has sown How far beyond thy hopes, and let thy heart Weep blood, if yet the fount of tears be dry, Uriah too might have embroil'd the state And with rebellion's shrill sonorous trump Publish'd his wrongs, and call'd the tribes to arms But nobly he refus'd—thou little knowest What a defender you have flung away, If e'er sedition's flag shall crown thy towers, If e'er the desart, thro' its lonely bounds Shall joy to see its exiles steps return! Viz. David, who afterwards was expelled from Jerusalem by his son Absalom. I see thine agony, and for relief Of thy soul's torture, to another scene Direct thy charmed eyes, thou hast beheld The dark complexion of thy deeds outdone By Heaven's profest disciple, blest with rays Of Heaven's peculiar brightness:—how he curst The beam, and like an adder slunk away To mingle with his kindred glooms, incenst To feel the sacred light pervade his soul! Now view a warriour, whose benighted eyes Roll'd round in vain to find that heavenly ray Vouchsafed to that Iberian King,—whose lips The living waters from the hallow'd fount Never bedew'd, yet, (dubious as he stands Upon the trembling verge of life and death Whether the yawning grave shall close for ever His prospect, or the conscious mind survive To endless raptures, or incessant woes,) He minds not passion's call, he spurns away The snares of appetite that cross his path And court him to relax the stubborn nerve Of steel'd exertion, the seraphic forms Of good and fair, altho by glimpses caught Hurry him thro' the phalanx of his foes And bid him scatter all their adverse bands Like fire, ascending thro' th'incumbent mass Of some embowel'd hill. It bursts abroad All glorious, and the cloudy face of night Paints with aspiring flame, and vollied hail Of mimic stars! The Prospect changes to a Camp, Military Trophies, &amp;c. The General seated as if to receive an Embassy.—A Train of Suppliants approaching at a distance. Behold the noble youth Clad in the robe of conquest where he sits While all the breathing minstrelsie of war Sound his transcendent name from earth to heaven He minds them not!— Could you but see the conflict in his soul You still would tremble for him.—Such a form Has lighted up a fever in his blood That he seems something less, or more than man If aught, but death, or his warm wish enjoy'd Can work the cure! Behold the matchless maid By vows another's—yet in person free— Then judge, and ponder, how a Gentile breast Can turn th'artillery of such charms aside. David. Oh Heaven's! all other mortal forms, to this Are fleeting vapours, unsubstantial air— Or beauty ne'er was seen by me before Or she surpasses all the beauteous kind— His virtue, if he can resign such charms Exceeds the human pitch. Nath. You soon will judge He seeks not, for he knows not Heaven's support— There be, who know its value and who seek it, Then spurn it from them when they need it most. The GENERAL Speaks. Scipio Africanus. O dear bought laurels! would to Heaven my fall Had grac'd that fatal day on which, my shield Guarded a father's head! He sleeps in peace But, oh illustrious shade! if thou behold'st The struggles of thy son, support his spirit. If thou canst reach the source of heavenly light Oh! steal one beam of intellectual day And chace the demons who besiege the mind! Tell me! oh tell me, do they whisper peace Shall I obey them?—or, can I survive The pangs of separation from the maid Who lives in every nerve, in every pulse?— Yet honour calls to leave her! should I scorn The mandate? should I tear her from that heart Viz. Her betrothed lover. That owns a mutual flame, could I survive My honour? could I bear to hear my name Traduce'd, and level'd with the common herd The sport of every passion? I might teach Her heart to swerve from duty! I might lure Her yielding mind astray, by potent bribes Of Roman dignity: but Roman honour Forbids the thought. Let Punic souls obey Each gust of passion! let majestic Rome Subdue the world, by shewing how it can Subdue itself the first! I must not taint My country's fame amongst barbarian tribes By tyranny, and rapine, tho' by laws Of conquest sanctify'd.—It must not be.— Suffer I must! but let me feel for him Who, should I fail my passion to subdue Must sink beneath the pangs of hapless love! It must be conquer'd!—Rome's immortal cause, The common sympathy of man to man And reason, all demand it. But they come!— Be still my heart, and honour! bear me thro'!— [The Suppliants appear. Sons of Iberia! let my present purpose Shew you, that, not by thirst of conquest led Nor universal sway, the Roman arms Have met th'insulting The Carthaginians. foe of liberty Half way, in Spain, and drove him baffled home. It was, instead of violence and wrong To substitute the fair and equal ties Of stedfast equity and common faith. These, these alone the Romans wish to leave The trophies of their arms! by these to rule And claim the empire o'er the willing heart! They scorn dominion o'er obsequious slaves Who tremble at the rod, and hold their being On the frail tenure of a despot's breath They wish their allies men, to rank with men, The children of one parent, justly deem'd The friends of Rome, and worthy of her cause, And I will purchase them with such a gem As the sun seldom views [Goes into a Pavilion and returns with a young Princess. Behold her here Whom long as lost ye mourn'd! I might have kept This treasure for myself, and shipt to Rome The glorious prize, nor fear'd the taint of blame, I might have still preserv'd the world's esteem But I had lost my own!—I found her heart Devoted to another, with that heart Her hand shall go! and know, I more exult In this self-conquest, than, to climb the car Of triumph, o'er the whole assembled world With Carthage at their head! To thee, brave Prince By love of right impell'd, this royal maid I freely give. Receive her as thine own And with it Rome's respect and warm esteem. [Prospect closes. Nath. Ponder this scene! then weigh with equal hand The Gentile, and Believer, then reflect Whence flow'd the continence of one, and whence That wild misrule that madden'd in the mind Of that misguided King, and woke the storm That wreck'd his country's peace, then ask yourself If meddling zeal inspir'd my just reproof. [Exit Nathan. David. Was there not shame enough to sink my soul In the dark gulph of absolute despair? But horror too and grief must add their weight?— Yet they are welcome!—cover me, deep night! Ten thousand fathoms down, where never more The blessed beam of Heaven shall visit me Where never winged minister of her's Thorough the dismal gloom shall wing his flight To look on my sad fall, and turn away With deep abhorrence!—but what midnight shade Can hide me from myself! What curtain fall Between the piercing beam of torturing thought And its sad object? Yet, how gentle that To what this instant I perceive within This sense of desolation—Heavenly hate, This dead vacuity, this gloom of being! This settled sorrow of the swelling heart By which alone I feel that I exist!— Where shall I find him, where, the friendly power Tho' arm'd with vengeance? yet I wish to feel him And own the father in his dread correction. Father of mercy! let me own once more Thy presence, tho' it blast me! turn again Thy aspect, tho' incenst, on thy fallen son, And let me feel thy pity in the scourge That wounds to heal!—far, far around I look Amid the tossing of this mental storm Yet see no dawning of that welcome light Sign of returning peace! it is but just That I should wander in eternal gloom For wilfully on heaven's benignant beam I shut my eyes, and chose to grope my way To swift perdition with a demon guide. To him, ZADOK. From him, whom never yet desponding soul Address'd in vain, I come, but not with peace Nor soothing promise, long the storm must rage The dashing rain descend, and deluge spread Ere with the olive branch the dove returns Thy soul has lost its vigour—all its powers Are run to waste, its energy is gone— Extinct, by foul voluptuous charms exhal'd This to recover, needs strong discipline Effective, lasting, till its energy Recovers in the conflict, like the spark From stricken steel, or winter's fire, compress'd To tenfold ardour by the rigorous grasp Of winter's frory hand—This is Heaven's will Her primal law, by most effectual means To keep that sacred, active power awake In which th'excellency of mind consists If this be dissipated in the calm Of sensual life, or if, in sloth relaxt The faculties lye slumb'ring—then he calls His ministers—fierce pain, the alarm of war Domestic grief, adversity's stern march And quiver'd woes. They rouse the torpid mind Hunt her thro' all her feelings, till she rise From her terrene and most inglorious laire And Heaven-ward looks again, asserts her birth, Puts forth her pinions, vindicates the skies And leaves the worldly dim eclipse behind, But, if those fail, the gangrene is begun That leads to swift perdition. David. Heaven forbid Such means should fail! Oh let the discipline Be sharp enough! I shrink not, tho' it leave My trembling nerves all bare! welcome! affliction I bless your friendly frowns, to my sick soul More chearing than the Syren smiles that led My wand'ring feet astray. Your awful march And funeral ensigns, seen afar, I hail! Print not your footsteps lightly in the dust For every vagrant gale to waft away The traces of your visitation dread! But leave a deep, indelible path behind As when the avenger of his people's sins Treads the red wine-press in his jealous rage And stamps his vengeance deep—but me alone Visit, nor let my people share my woes!

Oh thou most lov'd Of all the pensive nymphs! vouchsafe once more That theme, which with an energy, divine Above aught vocal, thine enchanting power Did late impart! For to the arduous task Of perfect recollection thou alone Art equal. By thy kind conducting hand Weak Memory led, unravels all the path Where late she trode bewilder'd, whilst thy veil Excludes th'annoyance of a busy world! Or, if this great boon be deny'd, permit The mighty spirit of some Memphian sage Who tended erst thy temple on the shores Of Nile, and now, perhaps, with wonted guard Watches thy midnight throne, distinct and loud To chant thine awful legend. Let him tell How, tendant on the deity, you rode Far into chaos, and, with potent charm (Felt thro' his stormy confines,) still'd the roar Of fighting elements confus'd, and woke Order, at last, with thy soft touch, the foe Of the old Anarch, whom in viewless chains He held so long beneath th'oblivious pool, Ten thousand fathom down.

But, in a gloomy and degenerate age When Virtue, by her long exerted task Fatigued, and downward menacing, at last To superstition sunk, inglorious then And deep degrading was thy sad employ, To watch in convents dim the leaden look Of barren contemplation, or the hand Tracing a spiritless detail of facts Misnamed History, and oft thy guise By sacrilegious dullness was usurp'd In hooded majesty, to spread an awe O'er the unthinking crowd, misled with ease By semblance vain of cogitation deep. Yet not unuseful was thy steady care Even then.—That power omniscient (who surveys The gradual forming of the human race From savage to refin'd,) on thee bestow'd An office of high import, to preserve Those nobler monuments that bore the stamp Of wisdom, by a length of years sublim'd Far, far secluded from the scrutiny Of eyes profane, and apprehension's rude Lest, madd'ning with the strong ideas, thence Imbib'd, their zeal, all immature and wild Should prompt them to disdain their lowly plight During the middle ages, the more valuable remains of ancient writings were generally unknown, or despised; the final cause of which seems to have been what is mentioned above, viz. the prevention of premature innovation.And, aiming at perfection, idly mar The certain, slow procedure of that hand Which, with improvement, joins stability. But, some, of spirit more inquisitive And restless, daring with unlicens'd eye Thy yet forbidden treasures to profane Quickly, with more than Telamonian strength Dulness, thy new ally, step'd forth, and wide Display'd her deadly Medusean shield A mirrour, by a necromancer's art With a strange, fascinating power replete. By this the forms august of ancient times Illum'd, all sudden, as by some foul blast They seem'd to lose each fair primæval grace And all appear'd a rude and shapeless mass Unlovely to the quick, disdainful eye Of disappointed Fancy. Hence arose That cold contempt for every noble form Delineated there by hands divine It was a common practice of the Monks, in the dark ages, to erase from an old manuscript, a decad of Livy, or an oration of Cicero, and supply its place with some Saint's legend, or the decretals, when the materials for writing were difficult to be procured; hence many ancient books were lost.

FINIS. THE GENIUS OF THE WHITE ROSE, THE PRIZE POEM FOR THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX. The subject of this piece is the resignation of Richard Duke of York, to his uncle the Duke of Glo'ster, by his mother. It opens with a soliloquy of the Genius of the York family, on the morning of Edward the Fifth's supposed coronation. “On this glad scene what mortal change impends? Why mourns the pomp along the public way? What fun'ral gloom its baleful shadow sends To blast the hopes of this distinguish'd day? “And see! amid yon venerable train, Rank after rank, that form the moving state, Two spectres dim the herald's garb profane, And marshal Edward to the field of fate! “Half sunk, and deadly pale, the royal boy, The sick plume trembling o'er his faded brow, Seems to recoil from the tumultuous joy, And mourns the boon the wayward fates bestow. “The fraudful pomp the stern Vicegerent leads, Cov'ring his deep deceit in fair disguise; And tho' the sov'reign call of nature pleads, The cruel victor scorns her potent voice.” “May not a solitary life suffice? Still further shall the waste of carnage spread! And must the sovereign stem be wounded twice, And twice the royal blood by ruffians shed?” “It must—for lo! another hand unseen, With veil funereal shrowds the awful dome, Where, with her younger hope, the widow'd queen Claims the protection of a sacred home.” “Less doubtful still and deadlier signs ensue: Lo! severing in the midst, the cloudy veil Leaves to the sun, in broad portentous view, A Painted glass—supposed in Westminster Abbey. window, fraught with that disast'rous tale:” “How jealous Ire in infant blood was dy'd, And all the Jewish tyrant's Herod. fruitless rage; When, waging war with Heaven, he vainly try'd To quell the glory of the rising age.” “The holy infant soon a refuge found; Soon was his mighty father's arm display'd: But thee, fair branch of Edward's stem renown'd, Ev'n in those sacred walls shall fate invade!” “And see! Heav'n's omens aid the sign beneath! See! beaming on the twins an influence dire! The warrior planet looks debate and death, And wayward Saturn joins his sullen fire! “'Tis done—my charge for ever I resign!— But what avails the various fields of blood? The many triumphs of the mighty line? The combinations by their arms withstood? “Ah! race renown'd in vain! in vain elate With many a trophy won by matchless might! If by thine own fell hand, the pow'r of fate Sinks thy proud glories in eternal night!” Thus mourn'd the Genius of the Paler Rose, As hov'ring o'er the pompous, deep array, He saw young Edward, by his deadly foes, Led to his fate, a dumb defenceless prey. Sorrowing, he saw his tender pupillage Their blooming hopes to early fate resign: When, his fast-rising anguish to assuage, Appear'd the genius of th'ascending line. “Behold me sent,” he said, “to clear away The ominous night that clouds thy hopes and thee: And end the feuds of many a bloody day, When civil discord rag'd from sea to sea. “Mourn not the royal boy's untimely doom; But hear the dread designs of sovereign fate; Who, provident of ages yet to come, Ends the mad tumults of the guilty great. “The blooming males of Edward's regal brood, Each in his turn to destiny shall yield; That Mars no more may keep the isle in blood, Nor Discord wave her flag in ev'ry field. “Long by her cruel uncle woo'd in vain, The virgin heiress of the royal line; Shall see young Richmond cross the Gallic main, And on one stem the mingled roses join. “See! where on Bosworth's plain the victor tow'rs; The battle swerves beneath his proud controul: And see! th'usurper hem'd by hostile pow'rs: How he breathes out his fell, indignant soul! “Nor thou, intent on partial views, repine The triumphs of a rival to survey See! where in one their mingled glories join, And golden years succeed the dreadful day? “Mean while, obedient to the stern commands Of fate, I go to claim the younger born Of Edward, from his weeping mother's hands, The widow'd Queen, of ev'ry hope forlorn! “With bloody meaning to invade those bounds, Where hov'ring angels tremble as they gaze, Me, tho' no mortal born, with pity wounds, And the firm purpose of my soul betrays.” This said, in semblance of a prelate hoar, The great upholder of the Cestrian state, Approach'd, with fatal speed, the sacred door, And enter'd, where the royal mother sate. With reverence meek, began the seeming saint “Hail! royal mother of a mighty line, So may kind Heav'n your last petition grant, As you with gentle heart accord to mine!” “By me Heav'n claims the royal, guiltless child, Souls pure as his no low asylum need: Meet are those walls to screen the blood-defil'd, Not him who never knew unholy deed.” “Here, brooding over his eternal wounds, Let the sad felon his lone hours employ; But never be it said, those hallow'd bounds From fancy'd evil screen'd a blameless boy. “Shall every fear of wayward fancy's brood Give to this mansion a desponding guest? Shall sacrilegious passions here intrude, And break upon the temple's holy rest? “Shall guilt and innocence promiscuous here Find an asylum? Hence the thought profane! Shall each alike the garb of penance wear, And pious fraud the holy presence stain; “Here let remorse and sorrow wake to weep, And purge their stains with penitential tears; But let not hate her sullen sabbath keep; Nor squint suspicion tell her fancy'd fears!” “Ask him who sent thee if my fears be true, (With royal scorn the lonely Queen reply'd); Ask him who Pomfret's deadly secret knew, Why her sad streets with noble blood were dy'd? “Ask him, who with his ruffians holds in awe My son, yet mocks him with a royal name? And, while his fell assassins o'er him draw Their snares, deep lulls him in a golden dream. “Yes! let that artful tyrant tell with pride, How o'er the church he stretch'd his iron rod, And bade her sons in him alone confide, Daring with dreadless front to mock their God. “That God, who bids a mother's trembling heart Outreason all the sages learned pride; Bids nature drown the feeble voice of art, And menac'd lives from real dangers hide. “But what avails a mother's trembling heart? Ah! what avails a mother's feeble pow'r? I see the close approach of murd'rous art, I see, alas! my Richard's fatal hour!” “Yet with my son I'll meet the stroke of fate! Together will we meet the tyrant's frown! Our fall will raise his savage pride elate, And all his cruel machinations crown.” “And yet, ev'n yet, I'll trust the bounteous pow'r, That rais'd me humble to a royal bed; That o'er my child, in this disastrous hour, His kind paternal arm shall still be spread.” “Trust in him still,” the mitred form reply'd; “Trust him for better seasons to ensue: His messenger, I bid thy fears subside, And open fairer prospects to thy view.” “Not Gloster's vassal I, nor his command Sways me this holy task to undergo: Accept a pledge of faith, this spotless hand; I come to his designs a deadly foe.” “I come to save thy son! for hov'ring nigh The tyrant's guards, on some black errand bent, Seem to regard those walls with savage eye: Then haste! fair mourner! and thy foes prevent!” “Full little would those walls”—He scarce had said: The trumpet blew the loud concerted sign. “Oh! save my son!” exclaim'd the Queen dismay'd, “They come! Oh! save the last of Edward's line!” She spoke: and, swooning, fell a lifeless corse; In dark oblivion long entranc'd she lay: And when her vital pow'rs resum'd their force, The victor's hand had borne the Prince away. WOODSTOCK. THE PRIZE POEM FOR THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SEVEN. The scene of the following little piece is laid at Woodstock, during the captivity of Elizabeth, who was confined there by her sister Queen Mary. Ye lonely shades, where Rosamond allur'd Her Henry's steps from Glory's paths to stray; Where, in the roseate bow'r of bliss immur'd, Reckless, he saw his laurel'd pride decay. How brook'd the genius of yon solemn grove, His ancient haunts by lawless love profan'd? Disdain'd not his pure feet those lawns to rove, Till late the In the time of Chaucer, the father of English poetry, who was born near Woodstock. lyre once more his presence gain'd! His magic lyre the mighty minstrel ply'd; The list'ning Dryads to their haunts return'd: A fresher verdure cloath'd the prospect wide, And brighter hues the flow'ry banks adorn'd. No trivial purpose bids his numbers flow; No trivial guest those hallow'd bounds await: —Meek virtue here shall shun th'impending blow, And here religion lodge her sacred freight. Hark! superstition lifts her savage voice! See! kindred bands dissolve, and love recede! The pastor's hand th'imploring flock destroys; And persecution bares her ruffian blade! Ev'n mercy's self forsakes the bloody throne; The Queen, Mary. relentless, sees a sister led By alien hands, unfriended and alone, Where he rude prison rears her awful head. Thy gates, O Woodstock! ope with sullen sound; In dismal view thy haggard walls appear! Starting, the royal captive gaz'd around, And down her pale cheek stole th'unheeded tear. The jarring valves the stern attendants close! Her dreary lot the silent Princess eyes; And as her fancy teem'd with future woes, Thus burst her passion intermix'd with sighs: “Look down, great Henry! from the realms above, If earthly cares can reach thy holy rest, Behold the fruits of thine ill-omen'd love, Friendless, forlorn, by causeless hate opprest!” “Oh! would to Heav'n, thy unrelenting rage Had erst involv'd me in a mother's doom; How easy death in that unthinking age, How soft the passage to an early tomb?” “But now reflection points the coming blow, And mem'ry joins her keen, malignant light; I see the deadly purpose of the foe, And deprecate in vain the dreadful sight!” “But who shall dare her private woes to mourn, When bleeding England pours the gen'ral groan? When pale religion points to Cranmer's urn, And holy frenzy guards the bloody throne?” “Ill-fated England! unsubdu'd before! 'Tis thine to suffer, and 'tis mine to weep; In vain the frowning cliffs protect thy shore, And vain, with all her storms, thy circling deep.” “Thine inbred foe, the demon of the soul, Converts thy sceptre to an iron rod; Soft pity sinks beneath his dire controul, And the proud Hierarch dares belie his God.” “Rome's abject hirelings now infest the coast, Where erst the hardy Roman learn'd to fear; Where Julius Cæsar. Gaul's proud victor saw the British host Mock the keen light'ning of the lifted spear.” “But now, even hope forsakes the mourning plain, No friendly ray pervades the settled gloom; The prospect lours beneath the frown of Spain, And silent nations wait th'impending doom.” While thus the royal maid her sorrow spoke, Night stole unheeded on her rising woes; And slumber lock'd her sense, but fancy woke, And, in her dreams, an aged minstrel rose. A tuneful harp of antique form he bore, Drest like the bards of old, a quaint attire! And tho' long years had snow'd his temples o'er, His eye preserv'd the poet's genuine fire. And this the awful prelude of his song: “Hope shall revisit soon the mourning plain; Even now thy name yon heav'nly choirs among Resounds, the future sov'reign of the main. “Heav'n-sent, those once-lov'd bounds my steps invade; Thy causeless grief commission'd to expel!

But lo! the cross of England waves afar; The banded millions mix in mortal fight; And, hov'ring o'er the wide-extended war, The foe of mankind soars with stern delight.

See Hume and Robertson. to sustain, and these to overthrow Th'imperial ensign, toil in bloody fray; And still the deadly contest seems to grow Where'er the winds its crimson folds display. Where'er the fiery meteor seems to wave, In civil rage the broken bands disjoin; Loud discord's voice is heard around to rave, And busy fiends the social tyes untwine. Then the stern ruler of the azure deep, Seem'd o'er the scene his triple mace to wield; The wild waves spread around, with murm'ring sweep, And ocean hid the late ensanguin'd field. Around the stormy capes the fleets, far seen Advancing in a line, for battle form; And now, a narrow interval between, They meet with loud salute and dire alarm! The flash, abrupt, foreruns the brazen roar; Responsive thunders roll around the bay; The sulph'rous vapour spreads from shore to shore, Hiding the horrors of the doubtful day. Defeat of the Spanish Armada.The curtain'd clouds divide; a scene appears Of flames, and driving wrecks, and recent gore! Eliza's name the gale in triumph bears! Eliza's name resounds from shore to shore! Distant at length the martial notes decay, And soon the whit'ning sails are lost to view; With silent ebb retires the peaceful sea, And smiling summer clothes the fields anew. Fair seem'd the scene, but unsubdu'd and wild, With, here and there reclin'd, an uncouth swain, Who, with rude songs, the vacant hours beguil'd, Or, musing, hear'd the pebbled rill complain. Sudden the deep and lonely woods among Was heard the solemn music of the lyre; The rude tribes crowd around the magic song, And rapture seem to catch the heav'nly sire. Nor caught in vain; for o'er the savage sense Mild reason seem'd to steal with gentle pace: New habits grow, and new designs commence, As on the nymph the thronging rustics gaze. Establishment of the University in Dublin. Alma her name, her golden locks betray'd; Her race deriv'd from him who rules the day; A pearly zone her azure vest upstay'd, Giv'n by the sov'reign whom the floods obey. Her voice explain'd the lessons of her lyre; Her sainted look enforc'd the heav'nly song: Her lectures seem'd new wisdom to inspire, And mould the instinct of th'admiring throng. Soon o'er the fields the congregation spread; A milder aspect soon adorn'd the plain; Instant before their steps disorder fled, And arts and culture follow'd in her train. Scatter'd around, the jocund hamlet rose, And, girt with harvests boon, the village gay, Wide-stretching mounds the echoing main oppose, And cities far their spiry pride display.

Statesmen and Lawyers.Some, when rude contests rose the swains among, With healing words dispell'd the rising jar; Poets.And some were taught with soft mellifluous song, To chear their toils beneath the sultry star. Astronomers.Some taught the seaman to direct his prow O'er the broad Main, by mild Arcturus led; Natural Philosophers.And some explor'd the secret depths below, To find what nature there in silence bred.

The scene smil'd lovely, and in smiles withdrew; The bard alone remain'd, and thus began: “These future prospects op'ning to thy view, 'Tis thine, with Heav'n-directed eye to scan.” “Either on conquest's purple wing to rise, Or deck with peaceful hand the savage plain; To raise Old England's flag in hostile skies, Or nobler realms, with peaceful arts, to gain.” “'Tis thine to chuse”—“Nor be the choice delay'd,” Sudden, tho' still entranc'd, the maid reply'd; “Be mine to triumph in the peaceful shade, Far from the dazzling pomp of martial pride.” “His captive legions let the victor shew; Be mine the empire o'er the willing soul; The veteran bands of vice to overthrow, And ignorance and error to controul.” “Be mine to rule the silent, studious train, Who form the manners and the man refine: Whose milder glories own no guilty stain, Whose peaceful brows no bloody wreath entwine. “Thus myriads yet unborn shall gladly own, With unbought praise, my long remember'd sway, And, plausive, hail my academic throne, When trophied arches fall, and urns decay.” “Some new Pythagoras then may boast an eye To trace the deeper wonders of the sphere; Some Tully's thunder shake the northern sky, And pour conviction on the gen'ral ear.” “Some kindly hand may bid the laurel spring, Even in yon drear uncultivated soil; Some friendly patron teach the muse to sing, And deathless strains reward the gen'rous toil.” She spoke: and thus the gentle bard reply'd: “Still may you thus protect the gentle muse; Lo! Heav'n, by me, hath thus thy judgment try'd, And mark'd, well pleas'd, thy far-extended views. “Alike in arts of peace and martial might, Old England's genius dooms thee to excell:” He spoke—and mingled with the shades of night; His lyre symphonious sent a sweet farewell.

Thus, to the climes that front the Boreal star He took his dauntless way.

Flashing anger, pale surprize, Alternate froze, alternate glow'd On his pale cheek as he stood And “oh,” he cry'd, “forbear, forbear!” (The crowd their orisons withheld) “See the fraudful phantoms there “Whose sway the ancient world bewail'd “They mix their dark spells with the saintly rite “And haunt the holy roof in Heaven's despite “See Ceres there, and Bacchus stand “The magian with commission'd wand “Deals on this forbidden ground “His fell demonian charms around.” “In league with fell despotic sway “He bends your free-born souls to tremble and obey. “Seize him,” the Flamen cry'd (His bosom burning with pontific pride) “Haste, bring that youth! some imp of hell “Bids his demonian frenzy swell “Haste, exorcise the latent pest “That harbours in his heaving breast “And interrupts our heavenly rite! “Hurl him to Hades and old Night.” The Ministers obey'd the stern command And seiz'd the youth with potent hand The Priest his mutter'd spells began And o'er his incantations ran. The sacring bell began to toll To disengage the lab'ring soul. In vain—his eyes began to glow His giant nerve repell'd the foe While, from the full vase sprinkled frore The sacred lymph bedew'd the floor. With vigorous arm he dash'd around The lifted cross,—the vase profound. The magic book he hurls afar And all the sacerdotal war. Prostrate on earth in wild affray Around the pale assistants lay Sudden, the strange contagion spread Revolt and faction rais'd its head The madding crowd, as well as he Clearly saw, or seem'd to see The demon gods of ancient days Partners of celestial praise. And from the fane at once recoil'd Following their youthful guide, like Moses, to the wild. V. With more than moonstruck rage tyrannic power Bann'd aloud the luckless hour. “Oh! had I been content,” he cry'd, “With war and slaughter by my side “To trust the trenchant sword alone “Nor call for succour to the gown “Nor let their cobweb arts essay “To lead the multitude astray, “Even ignorance, to thought unus'd “Feels its implicit faith abus'd. “But haste, ye Ministers of mine, who wield “Far other and more deadly arms “Nor vainly trust to futile charms! “Pursue the fugitives, pursue “While yet the bold revolt is new “While yet it lies in woods conceal'd “Ere thro' the long Helvetian vales “This home-bred lunacy prevails. “Call to the Tiber, Seine, and Loire “To quench the rising flame, to join their liquid store “And bid my favour'd Elbe and Rhine “To aid my cause their force combine.” Instant, his legions heard their Lord Havock rous'd her northern horde Discord fires the kindred trains And Leman's lake with crimson stains. Insurrection in Switzerland, headed by Zuinglius the reformer.Freedom with religious faith 'Mongst the shadowy cliffs combining Feed the fray with magic breath Bright conquest now to this, now that enclining. Murther now, with stealthy pace Wand'ring thro' the midnight gloom The bold reformer holds in chace To mark him for the tomb. Safety is there for him no more Tho' his faction still survives And the blest energy to other realms derives. Yet still by civil conflicts tost Religion's patron seeks a safer coast And in the northern ocean dips his oar. There is, it is owned, something of anachronism in the foregoing ode. Religion had very little immediate influence on the first commencement of Helvetic liberty, which happened near a century before the reformation; whatever share the latter revolution might have had in the subsequent establishment of the Helvetic constitution. ODE THE SECOND. THE SHEPHERD'S NUPTIALS. I. England. Citadel of freedom, hail! Majestic rising o'er the tempest-beaten main Who to the persecuted train On every blast, from every shore Where regal frenzy dips his foot in gore Giv'st an asylum in thy wave-worn pale And beckonest with dumb welcome o'er The far-discovered sail! And not for nought,—for soon at hand Yon pinace furls her sail, the Exile seeks the land. Oh England! if thou lik'st to sleep In tranquil slumbers folded deep And hatest proud innovation's name, Her lifted ax, her brandish'd flame, Send, oh send, again to sea, The moody wanderer far from thee! For this is he whose chanted psalm Broke old Uris holy calm In Berne the flag of freedom wav'd And Rome's cowl'd squadrons singly brav'd Loos'd the charms that lock'd the mind And from thick films the mental eye refin'd The chief to thee is fled, but leaves behind Discord's rage that drowns the wind Fierce debates, and wordy wars Faction's feuds and kindred jars. Till dear-bought freedom sends again Her holy calm to bless her mountain reign. II. Has no sign his coming told No cause the refluent surge controll'd No meteor fir'd the angry air No comet stream'd a length of hair?— Time should now affrighted stand His idle weapon in his hand The sun should halt in mid career To see the wond'rous birth appear.— His coming by no sign is told The refluent surge is uncontroll'd. No meteor fires the angry air, No comet streams a length of hair, Nor Time astonish'd seems to stand Nor holds his scythe with idle hand, Nor halts the sun in mid career To see the wond'rous birth appear.— The simple train, that sees him land With rustic welcome line the strand. Nor, tho' he wears a look severe His unthought coming seem to fear. For not on them Influence of the Reformation on the liberties of England. his coming lours Who pass their spotless hours In hamlets poor, an harass'd train Up the hill, or o'er the plain. No—yonder Flamen's proud abode Fanes, which belie the name of God Cloister'd cells, where prison'd deep The mental powers in Lethes' sleep Repose, or pamper'd passions rave Like pent up storms in Æol's cave Where Luxury pants, and oft by stealth Draws a blinded nation's wealth, They may fear, but they are drown'd By wayward Fate in sleep profound Nor mind (by torpid Sloth subdued,) The menace of the mountain flood Fed by many a secret rill As the dews of evening still. But soon the thund'ring tide will sweep Their golden harvests to the deep And yonder snows, that, hoarded high For many a winter seem to lye Shall join the torrent's rapid flow And lay your haughty fabrics low For now the stranger in the wild Late from Uris' bounds exil'd Far within a sacred glade Where hawthorns grew, a fenceful shade Found a weeping widow, late Origin of the puritanic spirit occasionally augmented by a communication with Geneva, and from a dislike of ecclesiastical government, causing frequent emigrations to New England and Pennsylvania, during the reigns of James the First and Charles.Sever'd from her faithful mate, Her faithful mate, by cleric spite (She thought) had sunk to endless night, And now resolv'd to quit the shore The reliques of their ancient store They glean'd, resolv'd to cross the main With her young blooming orphan train Of these, a maid with heav'nly charms The stranger's rugged bosom warms. His suit the young Helvetian prest And form'd an interest in her breast. The matron heard the lover's prayer And soon consenting blest the pair. She seem'd her longing to retain Of following Fate across the main, Yet staid, till Time her round had run And the blest exile clasp'd a son, Short liv'd joy, to anguish turn'd! Soon his loss the parents mourn'd. Whether by vagrant thieves purloin'd Who chanc'd the wand'ring boy to find, Or moonlight fays (from bless exil'd) Who fear'd the fortunes of the child Not yet was known, And loud and long His parents wail'd, by anguish stung And both at once devoutly swore To leave that sad, ill-omen'd shore, They hoist the sail and court the wind Leaving their eldest hope behind. III. Their eldest hope, an ancient crone Had borne away to glins unknown. Skill'd in witching love was she Her cot was by the ancient Dee, Ancient Dee, of wizard name Where still the fays their sabbath claim, There, beneath the moony light O'er the watry mirrour bright Oft he saw his sires advance Gleaming in the lunar glance, Warriours old of Saxon brood Who the tyrant sway withstood. Now in wild, expressive strains Bloody fields and broken chains. Oft, and oft, he heard them sing Circling round in mazy ring. The boy attends with sparkling eyes To dauntless deeds of high emprize, The glorious visions haunt his sleep And shed th'infusion full and deep. Now of heavenly truths she tells Taught in hamlets, and in cells By the Arimathæan old Wafted here in times of gold. Nothing now he seems to breathe But ancient freedom, ancient faith, Ancient laws, and ancient tales And spreads them thro' the list'ning vales, Like his restless sire of yore Round old Leman's winding shore. Soon the simple swains began To crowd around the wond'rous man And propagate his rapt'rous strains O'er Britannia's list'ning plains. Despotic power, with wild alarm Call'd her levied bands to arm, And bar'd her blade, and wav'd her brand To drive the rebels from the land. Captivity disclos'd her glooms And peopled all her noisome rooms. Tyranny of the Star Chamber and High Commission Courts. But Bondage, sword, and Fire were vain To crush the still encreasing train, Who claim'd their rights, and knew their force, Their bard had taught the sacred source From which they drew their charters old By ancient Monemon's care enroll'd. But ah! too feeble is my song To sing the conflict stern and strong, The stratagems, the rage employ'd The mighty quarrel to decide. And now the roving muse the flight explores Of that desponding pair who left Britannia's shores. The epithet despotic will not be thought too severe for the 12 first years of Charles First's reign, distinguished by arbitrary taxation, and a difuse of Parliament. ODE THE THIRD. THE SHEPHERD'S VOYAGE. I. Should some strong hand unmoon the sky And spread from Demogorgon's loom The curtain deep of Stygian gloom, Nor leave a star, with twinkling eye Our wand'ring planet to illume, (Except some meteor broke the sable woof, Shot thro' Heaven's umbrageous roof) 'Twould shew, our world's lamented plight, Sunk in Slavery's thickest night, When Freedom's ever-moving tide From our sadden'd shores retir'd Except one favour'd land, where fate conspir'd To bid the doubtful blessing still abide, Like the star that rules the flood She bade her retinue obey The shadowy throng her call pursu'd And mov'd in order west away. North America.Hesperia's groves obedient bow'd As the pomp aerial past, As o'er Oswego's tranquil flood Her breezy robe the goddess cast, With murmurs low the foamy waters curl'd And hail'd the mistress of the we stern world. The genii of the woods and waves The spirits of the hills and caves Her presence felt; the savage tribes Each the sacred power imbibes, But intellectual light alone Could give the Queen a stedfast throne Cecropia's old and equal laws Rome's well digested code, and Alfred's ancient saws. II. Religion too, seraphic maid The goddess call'd to aid, Then to the climes from whence the day-spring flows Where the confed'rate powers of heaven and earth Matur'd of old the intellectual birth, Where blooms the citron, and, the palm tree blows She look'd for aid, for with the rising sun The dawn of science first begun, And with slow progress verging west The world's revolving shores like travelling summer blest And see, the fated barque at anchor wait Ordain'd from shore to shore to cull her precious freight, The broad Atlantic first she skims, Old name of Gibraltar.Zibalterras sea-beat brims She leaves, and many a far fam'd isle To where Emanuel clos'd his earthly toil— Thence, North by West the winged vessel steers And from each Dorian, each Ionian coast, Climes renown'd in ancient days Themes of everlasting lays A willing exile bears. Thro' seas, by many a Land emboss'd To On the western coast of Italy. Luna's port she plows her liquid road Thence, by Massilia, thro' the midland flood Then stems the tide to Calpes strand To Britain thence, by Fate's command Where on the shore the youthful stranger stood See Ode 2d. Desponding on his wayward fate With him his young and lovely mate Ready to pass the foaming flood, The vessel moor'd They haste aboard, The last of that heaven-destin'd freight. III. Now, 'twixt the old world and the new Suspended, like that favour'd crew Who mann'd the sacred planks by Heaven decreed To save the last remains of mans' devoted seed, They hover on the Atlantic deep. Ah! would the banded West but rise And drive them back to Dover's steep Ere old Columbus gain the prize! In vain the wish, in vain the prayer! They go, transplanted to a kindlier mold Where warmer suns sublime the year Before our vales their blooms unfold!— As Egypt fabled, from the west Forgetful of his Indian bed In new-born state triumphant drest Another sun shall lift his head And eastward turn his ardent face And backward tread th'ecliptic way The muses shall attend his race And all the arts in bright array. Hyperion's son shall wond'ring view His glittering rival cross his car, His steeds of mere ethereal hue Whose footsteps sire the ambient air. Of ripen'd fruits Hyperion boasts The spreading palm, the sparkling gem The golden hoard, the spicy coast The offspring of his potent beam. Not so, the lord of intellectual light He bids the purest germs of genius bloom Which chaces from the mind Cimmerian night And bids Virginia's warriours equal Rome. See! how the rising zephyrs breathe away Yon envious clouds that hide his sapphire throne! See, Tyranny beholds with dire dismay, And flies before the God from zone to zone. IV. But oh! presumptuous muse! detain The frenzy of the rising strain— —Yet, but the dubious dawn is seen O'er th'Atlantic wavy green, Columbus' world in soft repose Yet no startling signal knows. For yet her heavenly guests on alien ground Roam in disguise like weary pilgrims round, Yet, where they walk, the lawns extend Desolation leaves the path And, with less savage wreath The woods around the hills their less'ning umbrage bend The wood nymphs forc'd to leave the strand Left a fearful curse behind, And see it settles o'er the land It blackens in the wind! Hovering o'er the old world far Brews the stygian storm The god of battles climbs his car Oppression, avarice, factious rage Fanatic feuds, by many an age Nurst to a giant form See! where their victims crowd the strand Some from the pressure of the tyrant's hand Some by the spectre Want pursue'd Some, by the restless spark within Impell'd the watry world to roam Impatient of a settled home, Or by some stroke of cruel fate, Hapless love, or ruthless hate, Doom'd to trust the fickle wind And leave their loves, their cares behind. Each fiery spirit check'd at home Or pent in deep oblivion's gloom, There hop'd an ample range to find For th'excursions of the mind. With joy Oppression saw them go And smooth'd his formidable brow When those, he deem'd the demons of the storm Who us'd to spread the wild alarm And oft unsettled all his schemes And often broke his golden dreams Were gone, she hoped again to know The halcyon days of bliss below, As when Assyria felt his rod And Persia own'd an earthly God. Nor more the Spartan fife to hear Deadly music to her ear. But instead, some courtly strain In Lydian measure breath'd to soothe his tyrant reign. V. Oh! ill advis'd! because the parched vale Rises in dust beneath the Orient blast. To think the western storm no more will swell To lay at once thy waving harvest waste? That power which keeps the air in equal poise And bids the viewless current ebb and flow, Who now bids Auster load the humid skies And now Aquilon sift his virgin snow. That power, for wiser ends has sent the scourge Of lawless power this weeping planet round, He'll waft again his exile o'er the surge And nations tremble at her Clarion's sound. When he would call some great event to birth To startle heaven, and shake the sons of earth, He bids men's selfish views the fabric raise And from his stormy rage elicits praise. He calls the mental beam away To the source of endless light The passions hail the welcome night And domineer with furious sway. Then drives the vessel of the state On the rocks of mad debate. Despotic power, in the fierce conflict spent, To fill her faint, exhausted veins Quaffs the life-blood of the swains. The swains at last resent And their rous'd vengeance sweeps away At once the plunder and the prey. Thus man, by others harm untaught Learns moderation from his own disastrous lot. VI. And thou, perfidious Gaul That lend'st thy weak hand to thy neighbour's ponderous fall And swell'st the loud alarm afar Where Boston breathes revenge and war Ill does thy feeble pipe, with tuneful strife Aspire to join its sounds with Sparta's fife. Yet long enur'd to themes of glory Soon it leaves the Lydian measure Learn'd in scenes of courtly pleasure Ere freedom op'd her wond'rous leaf of story. O brainsick men! to think each slavish tool Will come from this tremendous school, With the same habitudes he felt before On your voluptuous, smooth, seductive shore. No—like the fam'd Trophonian grot Where oft the sons of dance and song At their first entrance frisk'd along Then visited the world with alter'd sober thought. Thy merry slaves are taught another mood In yonder solemn groves beyond the flood. Like Britons now they learn to think and feel, And in the tyrant's face to lift the light'ning steel! Machinations of the French against the liberties and religion of Switzerland; and the persecutions of the puritans in England; set on foot partly by French politics.Thee too and thy arts of yore Felt by that Helvetian swain, The Leman lake's resounding shore Mourn'd thro' all her wide domain. Him tho' thy dark, pernicious arts annoy'd, And drove to Britain, thence to Georgia's wild; And thought the spirit-stirring race destroy'd, The parent lives, transplanted in the child. ODE THE FOURTH. THE SHEPHERD'S RETURN. I. Who yon fated pipe bestow'd On that wayward shepherd boy? Hark! he charms the list'ning crowd Where yon hill salutes the sky! From Helvetian race he comes, Of that haughty line is he Which relentless Fortune dooms Still to range from sea to sea. On yon hill he takes his post, Where advancing, van to van, Leagu'd against the freeborn host England's legions sweep the lawn. Opposite effects of the same education and sentiments of liberty, in the English invaders and the American defenders.Hark! the moody minstrel plays! Freedom beats the jocund round, While, unsinew'd by his lays Britain stands in torpor bound. Soon the tints of memory fade, Glory warms her sons no more; Factious feuds their ranks invade, Selfish aims, and pleasures lore. Strange effects of mingled strains! Here in phalanx firm unite, Levied new, the rustic swains, And like veterans, brave the fight. Blindfold there their foes invade, Thoughtless march, and thoughtless fall; In the gloomy ambuscade, Like a net, surrounding all. Rouse, Britannia, rouse to arms! See another foe appear, Gallia joins the loud alarms, Point anew thy dreadful spear! Again, old England's native courage glows, She pours vindictive on her ancient foes. The present Earl of Moira, then Lord Rawdon, descended from the Royal Family of Plantagenet, by the line of Clarence.Hastings draws the lineal sword, By brave Plantagenet, in slaughter dy'd. When flying Gaul in vain her saints implor'd And drop'd her libid pride. But all in vain, The wily train, Avoids the coming foe; His rage beguiles And mocks his toils, And wards the lifted blow. Rest of her conquests, by their usual art, Britannia mounts the deck with vengeful heart; Resolv'd, since all her toils by land are vain, To vindicate the waves, and chace them from the main. II. And now, perfidious Gaul, to vast designs Expands the powers of her ambitious soul; In fancy now she grasps Potosi's mines, And rules the western world from pole to pole: And many a province, for her equal meed, In thought she claims, rapacious as of old, When sad Alsatia saw her shepherds bleed And Belgia's plains a tale of carnage told. But when the Guardian of the clime, Heard from her cloudy throne, afar, The murmurs of the sinking war; From her seat sublime She watch'd the future births of time, And saw the dangers dread, and near To her nacent realm appear: Then, verging like the setting moon To the fount of Niagar, As the pale night's witching noon, The mighty mother bent her car. She call'd the Power who sends the flood Down the loud resounding steep, Before her face the vision stood, Like blue mist steaming from the deep. “Haste,” she cry'd, “your parent power “Seek beneath the briny wave, “Revolutions charge the hour From the restless spirit of the French, it may well be supposed that if their former government had continued the jealousy of despotism might have induced them, at some period, to endeavour to weaken the power of the American Union, by open or secret means, if Providence had not interfered in favour of the United States, by giving the French liberty. “Man's best rights his aidance crave. “Tell the floods, when you convene “In the palace of your sire, “Rapid Rhone, imperial Seine, “Reed-crown'd Scheld, and viny Loire. “Tell what Freedom here has done, “And give to each this sovereign juice “Gather'd in the night's pale noon “And bid him in his streams infuse. “Mingled with the nation's bowl, “Soon their fervent sons shall feel “Roman energy of soul “And proudly grasp the Freeman's steel.” III. The spectre stretch'd his shadowy hand, And the magic mixture took; Of potent drugs, from many a land, Flowers from fair Ilyssus' brook. Roots that love the rocky mound, When the royal Spartan bled, Leonidas. Herbs that spring on sacred ground Where the soul of Brutus fled. Pansies pale that love the bourne Where Eurotas' naiads stray, Daffodils, that ever mourn, Where the slaughter'd Wallace lay. King-cups fair, profusely fed, By the chiding brook that flows Round the skirts of Runnimede, Where Britannia's Freedom rose. Thus, surcharg'd, he left the steep, And sunk beneath the beating brine, Where the seniors of the deep Round their hoary King combine. Then he dealt the limpid prize To his brethren, first decreed, When they sought the upper skies, Freedom's nascent stem to feed. Near Athens. To check Ambition's wide-encroaching schemes By the fierce influx of domestic woes, And break the purple tyrant's golden dreams, By the dire tale of subjects turn'd to foes. IV. Hence the goddess to her charge Over forest, over plain Hastens to the sea-beat verge Of her wide Atlantic reign. America. Thence the shepherd boy she brought Viewless to her shady grot, Bade his ringlets flow with grace, Breathed the cherub in his face; Taught his pipe a softer sound, The ear to soothe, but not to wound. Then, amid the Gallic train By these are meant, the French troops in America, during the late war. Led the blooming boy again, The victor Gaul resigns his arms And clasps the minstrels heavenly charms: See the vett'rans thronging round All caress the wond'rous boy; Soon his pipe's enchanting sound, Fills their hearts with frantic joy. Ah! the soldiers little know While upon his charms they gaze. That star-like eye, that front of snow, And his mien's ethereal grace. Little do they dream what ills His infectious presence brings; What a charm his pipe instills, Fierce revolt, and hate of Kings! Cupid, not so fierce a flame, See Virg. Æn. 1. Wak'd in fair Eliza's breast, When the fair Sidonian dame That insidious child carest! Now the groaning deck he climbs, Her proud charge the vessel bears, While his pipe and rustic rhyme, Soothes the seamens raptur'd ears. Now the fated vessel moors On fair Gaul's unconscious strand; Fashion's vot'ries crowd the shores, Fashion hails him come to land. Fashion! proud fantastic Queen Fond of every foreign toy, Wilt thou dote upon his mein, Canst thou clasp a shepherd boy? Soon upon the banks of Seine Royal eyes shall weep the day When thine ear, fantastic Queen Listen'd to the shepherd's lay! Yet, ye Nobles! tho' his lay Grates upon a courtly ear, Drive suspicion far away, Show no dastard signs of fear. No, ah no—with gentle words, Soothe the wayward boy awhile; Dream no more of binding cords, Open force, or latent guile! Let him wander at his will, Let him chant his simple song And from thicket, glade, or hill Charm at large the rustic throng! For he is of that wand'ring race Blest with unsuppressive might, Erst they gain'd that sovereign grace From the source of life and light. Dungeon deep, nor castle strong E'er shall see him brook the chain; Soon the base intended wrong Viewless aid shall render vain. See! like attraction's world-pervading might, Soon as the general ear has drunk his lay, Regardless of their tenements of clay Their spirits press to him with fierce delight! V. But now the Monarch's jealousy is rous'd, The royal lips pronounce his doom; The wand'rer from his simple cot unhous'd Is borne to sigh amid the dungeon's gloom. The echoing vaults were said to shake When first the swain was lodg'd below; And some beheld the turrets quake Presageful of their overthrow. And to the moon, full many a martyr'd sprite, Wan tenants of her cells, in ancient days, Stole a short respite from the realms of night, And sung in ghostly quires, a song of solemn praise. The morning came, the pipe was mute, That us'd to wake the new-born beam; The crowd who lov'd to hear his flute, By spreading oak, or falling stream; Trac'd his steps, nor sought him long By instinct led, or black surmise, To those imperial rampires strong, Where, shut from day, the captive lies. Within they heard, or thought they heard, The shepherd's morning roundelay; Whether their hopes some spirit chear'd, Or Fancy charm'd their doubts away. As when old Æol's signal shrill Awakes the wind's intestine rage, And heard from high Olympus' hill Breathes the loud summons to engage. So the tide of frenzy rose, So the haughty wall they scale, Soon their oft repeated blows Shake the proud relentless jail. The Bastile. Hark! again the pipe is heard, “Bring the engines, bring the flame.” Freedom thus her cohorts chear'd Hurrying on with loud acclaim. Soon the simple strain is lost, In Bellona's thund'ring sound; Soon these walls, the tyrant's boast, In long ruin spread the ground. Now the shepherd swain is free, Loud resounds the plausive strain, From the bounds of Normandy To the Scandinavian main! When the sun begins his race Cynthia sinks in western gloom— Soon a King shall take his place And in woe his days consume. Soon a Queen shall mourn the day, Doom'd in durance long to sigh. Ah! how dear a price ye pay, Ye who scorn'd the shepherd boy!— VI. But he that loves the wild extreme, To swell the soft breeze to a storm, And bid the gently winding stream With giant sweep the sylvan scene deform. Combin'd with him, whose jaundic'd eye, Hates ascending worth to spy; Their baleful arts combine To blast the great design. One in the cup of Freedom throws That infernal drug, which grows In the verge of Stygian gloom; Foster'd by Cerberean foam, (Mingled with Echidna's gall, 'Tis quaffed in Demogorgon's hall. Where by the gleam of moon-struck eyes Flashing o'er the nether skies. Riot's griesly bands advance, And Anarchy conducts the dance. Chaos with his hundred choirs, Still the moody maze inspires.) The nations pledge it round and round, And deem the cup with blessings crown'd; 'Till the poison fires the veins, Strings the nerves and seethes the brains. VII. His brother fiend, to loose the ties That fasten mankind to the skies, Hastes the shepherd boy to find, Where, under shade, the youth reclin'd, Sitting, like a rural King; His brother captives in a ring, Hail the hand that struck the blow Which laid the house of bondage low! To him the wizard thus began:— “Never will the rights of man “Find a basis deep and broad, “While the sons of holy fraud “Hold their title by the charm; “Whose narcotic powers disarm “Every function of the soul. “By terrours feign'd above the pole, “See them in their station high, “Pretended Lords of earth and sky; “Dispensing life, dispensing death, “In a breeze of mortal breath. “Then they range in black array “Guardians of despotic sway. “Haste and drive them from their post, “Haste! or Liberty is lost!” See speeches of Dupont, and others, both in the Assembly and Convention of France. VIII. The swain believ'd, his pipe he blew, And soon appear'd the frantic crew. (For now the deep envenom'd bowl Had fir'd to madness every soul.) The fiend that came in Freedom's mask, Urg'd them to the bloody task. Rapine shew'd the glittering spoil, The fruit of many an ages toil. Beneath the startled eye of noon, Beneath the glimpses of the moon, Their deeds profane the sacred light And add new horrours to the night.— But wand'ring muse, resign the lyre, Such deeds would fright the virgin quire, They ask a deeply plaintive string, Strains that the hardest heart could wring. Old Avon's matchless bard could paint alone The bloody pall that hovers o'er the throne!— Written during the tryal of the late unfortunate King of France. ON THE BIRTH DAY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA, BARONESS HASTINGS, &amp;c. &amp;c. APRIL 10th, 1791. The tempests late, whose giant call Written after a series of very tempestuous weather. Awoke the furies of the deep, When Quiet fled, with ruffled pall And wild Amazement banish'd sleep. Are gone—and now, the white-wing'd hours In peace pursue their trackless course. No more the found'ring crews' dispairing cry, Nor woods resounding fall, nor torrents roar, Nor the loud tumult of the plaintive shore The chorus of the midnight hour supply. Ill would those sounds and scenes become That sacred, calm, and vernal night, (Brooding o'er the tender bloom) When first Eliza saw the light. For no rude passions vex her soul, No darkness clothes that tranquil scene, In halcyon calm her moments roll And all is light and peace within: Except when Sympathy's too poignant dart Invades, with barbed shaft, the feeling heart. For, not in listless ease reclin'd This sublunary scene she views, But studies still to make, or find Fit means her virtues to diffuse: And tho' in dignity retir'd No more she deigns an earthly court to grace, Tho' stationary, still admir'd, The habitant adorns the place. Tho' lonely now, Eliza seems to mourn, Her sphere, of kindred minds, disperst afar, Soon shall the radiant lights again return And circle round the bright, maternal star. Yet, starting from its lucid sphere, Alluding to the death of the Hon. Lady S. F. Forbes, daughter to the Earl of Granard.One lamp of love has found its way (Selina! check the falling tear!) To the fair dawn of heavenly day. Soon shall the constellation glow Attendant on the central throne. During a great part of this year, the family (except the Countess of Moira) were in England. O may they each, in time, bestow Light on a system of their own. Then each in honour's radiant sphere enshrin'd, May their sweet influence far, like her's, extend Still bright'ning on from kindred mind to mind, Till, like yon orbs above, their kindling virtues blend. ON THE BIRTH DAY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF MOIRA, BARONESS HASTINGS, &amp;c. &amp;c. APRIL 10th, 1792. I. While yet the messenger of spring Faintly hails the rising year, While yet with storms the forests ring And the pale pleiads from their sphere, For Nature's tints of vernal hue Blank scenes of desolation view; While Discord loads the passing gale, Or Sorrow's plaintive tones prevail: While many a Prince of Bourbon's line Lamenting roams along the Rhine, Or wafts his plaints to Cæsar's throne, And calls his tardy legions on. Fate smiles severe, and mocks their trust, For Cæsar's Alluding to the death of the Emperor Leopold. ear is stop'd with dust.— The pitying muse the fading prospect sees, And from th'unreal scene her pinions plies To find where living virtue warms the breeze, And baffling the bleak year, perfumes the northern skies. II. The first notice we find, in history, of the family of the Bourbon, is in the year 1381; when James de Bourbon, Count de la Marche, was sent against the Gascons, by John, King of France, and defeated. Their union with the Royal Family of Navarre (which opened their way to the crown of France) did not commence till about the end of the 15th century; whereas the branch of Hastings, by the medium of the family of Navarre, are descended in a right line from Charlemagne. —For an account of the family of Austria, see Sully's Memoirs, vol. I. b. 1. Notes.While Bourbon, yet a petty thane, Was lost in Gallia's martial train, And Austria's sires, unnam'd, unknown Their homage paid to Suevia's throne; Champions of Heaven, renown'd in days of yore, Eliza's regal fathers brav'd the sield, And sheath'd in arms, to Jordan's hallow'd shore, Led the long triumphs of the Red Cross shield; Or by the claims of honour fir'd, Or in their country's cause inspir'd; Call'd on their bands in harness bright Against some tyrant's lawless might. Their mild munificence, of heavenly birth, The fosterer of neglected worth, With all the kindred virtues, rais'd, refin'd, By circling Time's despotic sway, Are centred in their noble daughter's mind, Like gems, that drink abstracted light, Dawning thro' the waste of night; Or round the flowing robe display'd, Or midst the locks of some distinguish'd maid, With mingled beams, salute the eye, The absence of the sun supply; Or in his presence make a double day. III. And, while the fairies of the mine Below, shall course the wand'ring beam, And with the breded light combine The central, deep, chrystalline stream; Still thine honour'd line shall live And propagate her worth along. Fair theme of many a future song! It boasts no frail, material source, Nor Nature's blind, and plastic force The genial power, that forms the mind, The unspent energy assign'd. Thro' civil discord, calm repose, Thro' Nature's harmony and strife, Still, still, it kindles as it goes And gains new powers of light and life; And, with accelerated speed Along the path, by Heaven decreed. Still may the circling pomp its lustre lend To many a plausive age to come! Then, (when yon sun has quench'd his fires) 'Mongst the full empyreal choirs In Heaven's eternal dome; At the dread consummating hour Claiming their everlasting power, May Heaven's great jubilee behold its winged virtues blend. ON THE BIRTH DAY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA, BARONESS HASTINGS, &amp;c. &amp;c. APRIL 10th, 1793. In midnight pomp, in Tamor's fairy hall, (Her green stole for a mourning pall Exchang'd) the queen of Eirin sate, Pond'ring her isle's impending fate. Her tuneless lyre was hung on high Like a pale meteor in a gloomy sky; Her mute attendants stood around, List'ning with dread the distant sound, Where, must'ring all his factious tribes afar, The sire of tempest call'd his sons to war; Mad Rebellion rode the flaw, And loud Misrule, and scorn of law; From Gallia's strand, in dark ascent Their westward course the demons bent, And sent the foaming surge before Dashing on Ierne's shore. “Fling your spells! ye sylphid train! “O'er the land, and o'er the main. “Concord! on your halcyon car, “Mount, and meet the coming war. “Ere yon loud Æolian band “Smite my harp with frantic hand, “And rudely wakes the descant loud “That calls to arms the madding crowd.” In vain the Queen her prayers addrest, Howling o'er the starless waste, The coming tempest wing'd with fate, Wafts along its gloomy freight; And round the roof, with awful sweep Sends its voice, in cadence deep. Yelling thro' the rocking dome, Faction's fiend, on sounding wing, Twangs the high-suspended string, The signal to his sister Gnome. His sister Gnome the signal heard, And soon the flag of mischief rear'd; While Stygian lungs the pipe inspir'd, Which the rude revolters fir'd. Around in gloomy ambuscade, Peopling thick the waving shade In hordes, they plot th'intended wrong, Or sweep the plain, an hideous throng. The frighted moon their march beholds And in deep clouds her vestal charms enfolds. To Tamor's hall, with mast'ring powers The rebels point their midnight course; The Queen beheld, with terrour pale, Their ensigns, fluttering to the gale, And heard them, round the 'leaguer'd wall With menace loud for entrance call. “Oh! reach yon harp,” with loud exclaim The Queen began, “its magic frame “Shall echo that imperial strain, “At whose deep charm the rebel train “Shall drop their arms, and speed away “Like night, before the shafts of day!— “Touch the soul-commanding string, “Ye fairies! form a shadowy ring, “And chant those names, whose potent spell “The deadly pest can yet dispell; “Can rescue the insulted laws, “And bid the march of Horrour pause!— “Their virtues guard the threat'ned land, “Their worth arrests the flaming brand! “Eliza first, for her alone “The humanizing arts their lov'd protectress own; “Those favour'd arts, which charm'd of yore “The savage tribes on Hebrus shore. “When Orpheus touch'd the sacred wire, “And the wild passions own'd his lyre. “Her name perfumes the northern air, “Where sav'd from want and chill despair, “By the bounteous plans design'd “In her bright expansive mind. “ Plans for new manufactures in the linen branch, recommended and encouraged by the Countess of Moira.The swains, who mourn'd their way-ward lot, “New tracks of industry are taught; “Where her ready steps she turns, “Deep distress no longer mourns. “Where her smiles the prospect clear, “Anguish dries the falling tear. “The muse in her protection slumbers, “Time shall wake her magic numbers; “When the fated round complete “Shall bid awake the descant sweet, “Echoing thro' this gladsome hall “When other tribes shall hear the call, “And at the charm, the nameless clan, “Shall drop the savage, and resume the man!” Soon, ere half the song was heard, The dark invasion disappeared; Faction's hand her banner furls Discord all her snakes uncurls. The bugle blows a swift retreat, And back, “with many twink'ling feet,” They scud along the moonlight lawn Like elves before the rosy dawn. TO CHARLES WILLIAM BURY, ESQ. ON HIS RETURN FROM ITALY, 1789. I. Beneath some mould'ring wall's imperial frown, Or, by some river's flow'ry side, Of old, in Punic crimson dy'd. While, thro' the umbrage of the vale, In liquid accents sweet Dancing on silver feet, Her naiads tell the glorious tale; And, as they seek the neighb'ring deep, Some ancient warriour seem to weep, And many a martial form, of gray renown, Seen by Fancy's kindling eye, Sweeps in shadowy cohorts by; Where the mimic eagles gleam O'er the broad, translucent stream, Engag'd with some Campanian friend Late, Imagination view'd Your gently winding footsteps bend.

He would have wept—the burning sky Forbade the streaming grief to flow, He would have bade the zephyrs blow, To bring the welcome glooms again Settling o'er the azure plain; And many a look he cast around The wide horizon's sea-girt bound, To spy the showery bow— —But Fate forbade—for now beneath, By Eurus' unrelenting breath Conceiving life; the seeds of fire O'er the crackling roofs aspire; And high the fumy columns rise Dark'ning half the radiant skies, While shrieks of matrons rend the air, And hurrying crowds, in deep despair, Some, from the scene of horrour fly Some, the scanty stream supply; Some, by love, or friendship led The blazing beams undaunted tread, The screaming infant thence convey Or bear the precious bales away.— When, o'er the desolated scene The melancholy morning springs But “not with healing on her wings,” Thro' the late jocund street, with rueful mein The bankrupt crowd dejected strays, And each the hideous change surveys; And each—with many a mournful pause between— His loss recounts—and not in vain, Soon the prospect smiles again; Soon their Lord's benignant hand Bids their former hopes expand.

FINIS. VERSES, LEFT AT THE REV. PETER TURPIN'S, AT BROOKVILLE, IN HIS ABSENCE, Feb. 7th, 1792. Ah! Flora! why this dead repose? Awake and leave thy wintry tomb! And will no breathing sweets disclose To welcome Love and Hymen home? How would I bribe (if songs could buy) The seasons blessings here to join, I'd proudly share the owner's joy, For he would sympathize with mine! Did I possess Golconda's store, And all the wealth of rich Cathay, I'd wish him neither less nor more, Than what would give his virtues play. Written about the time of Mr. T's marriage. But had I sage An Enchantress in Ariosto. Alcina's voice, No breeze I'd call, no genial show'r, Yet soon a green alcove should rise To vie with Adam's nuptial bow'r. Yon beeches should expel the day, Yon borders long should breathe perfume, Yon mount that mourns the sun's delay Should rival Hybla's May-morn bloom. Yon elmy skreen that skirts the lawn, Should wave aloft, a solemn grove And seem an ample curtain drawn, To shield the seat of peace and love. Had I Astolfo's magic horn That chac'd the fiends with potent sound, No pest, on blighting pinion borne Should ever pass the hallow'd bound. “Check thy poetic flights, my friend,” Quintilio cry'd, and press'd my hand, “No magic bow'rs need here ascend, “No visionary blooms expand. “Here some perennials still remain, “If poets would vouchsafe to mind 'em: “Yonder they deck your friend's demesne, “Had you but eyes, you'd quickly find 'em. “Here Gilead's balm, and Sharon's rose, “Mingle, at morn, their fragrant breath; See Ariosto. “Yonder their op'ning blooms disclose, “Like Piety and spotless Faith. “That flower, which never opes its breast, “Till dews descend, and stars appear, “Is pity for the wretch distrest, “Unfolding at the falling tear. “In colours warm; exuberant, full, “Here friendship meets the ruffling gale.” And there in sober tints, and cool, Judgment, the pansie of the dale, From Tyber and Ilyssus brought; Some noble Scions deck the soil Assembled in yon shelter'd spot, They cast around a general smile. Here Roman spirit, Attic sense, Innoxious wit, and social mirth Around their mingled sweets dispense, Nor shame their old, illustrious birth. Would summer's transient blooms compose Connubial crowns with these to vie? Then chide not Flora's dead repose Nor blame the rigour of the sky. When driving winds and beating rain, The wintry prospect round deform Their vivid tints will still remain, Their scent exhaustless ever charm. FINIS. TO JOSEPH COOPER WALKER, ESQ. M. R. I. A.

When Licence lifts her Gorgon face, In the fair mask of Freedom drest; And calls her miscreated race To share the Bacchanalian feast. When torpid Reason seems to stand, Deploring her insulted laws, The muse with light'ning arms her hand, And bids her vindicate her cause. This was her boast, in years of yore, When honours due adorn'd her name; And, shall she wake on Liffey's shore, Without her meed, the patriot's flame? Forbid it, Pride! let Eirin learn at last, With due esteem the muses boon to prize; Seldom such blessings come, and part in haste, The rarest bounty of the frugal skies. ELEGIES. TO THE REV. JOHN SMYTH, Now of Liverpool. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG FRIEND, 1779. Tho' Heaven with sacred sorrow wounds thy heart; Tho' bleeding Friendship claims the falling tear, While, new to woe, her agonizing smart, Seems to thy tender feelings too severe. Yet learn, fond youth! with reverential awe, The secret steps of Providence to scan: Learn by what mystic ways she deigns to draw To opening bliss, her wayward creature, man. She sow'd the genuine virtues in thy breast, Nor was the copious seed bestow'd in vain, The generous crop the hand of culture blest, And Alma's care matur'd the golden grain. Soon learn'd thy breast with others joy to glow, Nor sick'ning Envy damp'd the rising flame; For others too it felt the shaft of woe, And own'd, with more than words, the wretches claim. Heaven sent a friend—Heaven saw thy op'ning worth, Reflecting full, a stronger tint receive, His fires responsive call'd thy ardours forth, And meeting hearts a mutual impulse gave. Thy feelings soon the strong attraction knew, Soon learn'd, with his, to shift their changeful air, In social joy, they took a livelier hue, Or mimick'd sad the sober tint of Care. Thro' Learning's mazy course, with him, you ran, Travers'd, with him, “her studious cloisters pale,” When now the smiling boy, chastis'd by man, His friendship felt with nobler ardour swell. Heaven mark'd the hour—and bade thy friend depart, Ere yet the world had dimm'd his chearful eye; With him she claims thy sympathizing heart, And bids thy kindling soul affect the sky. With what regret thine angel-friend beholds, Thine humble sorrows, grovelling on the earth, And blames afar, the sullen orb, that rolls So tardy on, to bring thy second birth. Then weep no more, nor grieve his sainted breast, With wayward grief, and earthly cares profane; Let no fond sighs disturb his sacred rest, Nor cares for thee his holy raptures stain. Nor dream how immature his virtues fell, Unripen'd, crude, beneath the spoiler's hand; Ere yet the generous fruit had learn'd to swell, By suns matur'd, by genial breezes fann'd. See yon fair tree, beneath November's flaw, How low it lies, from yonder bank uptorne, Its stem no more the genial juice shall draw, Nor May's sweet blossoms deck its boughs forlorn. Yet, had it stood, the pride of many a spring, And moonlight fairies danc'd around the shade; Some hand had dar'd an alien bough to bring, And to the alliance strange its youth betray'd. Then his degenerate brood, with fruitless tears, The fire, perhaps, had mourn'd, but mourn'd in vain; Inglorious then, beneath a weight of years, Slow had he sunk, the burthen of the plain. Some fostering hand, perhaps, misled by love, Had borne it hence, to some less genial soil, Taught it to scorn its old, paternal grove, Its planter's tender care, and pious toil. Or all the sad, ill-omen'd birds of night, Had tamely perch'd his weeping boughs among; The baleful troop had thither bent their flight, And claim'd its fruits to pay their boding song. Or, bid to deck some foreign idol's shrine, Prun'd to fantastic forms, it long had stood; While tasteless Vandals hail'd the low design, Or bent, with hands profane, the hallowed wood. Then weep no more—His branches wave sublime To other gales, and shade a richer mould; While fruits that scorn the tardy lapse of time, Deck his unfading boughs, with rip'ning gold. FINIS. HENRIETTA, A MONODY, ON THE DEATH OF MISS HENRIETTA FRANCES DIGBY, OF GEASHILL, DAUGHTER OF THE REV. WILLIAM DIGBY, DEAN OF CLONFERT, 1780. What envious hand has twice profan'd my bower, The elder Miss Digby had died about a year before;—shortly after the author's acquaintance with the family commenced. My myrtle bow'r, with slips of baleful yew, E'er April's sweets had twice adorn'd the vale, Or call'd the primrose pale, To mix her odorous scents with zephyrs new? Was it for this I left yon mountains blue, Where harsher seasons rule the bleak domain? For this, ye nymphs, I heard your gurgling rills, Invite me down the gentle vale with you, To taste the softer breezes of the plain. With you to rove among the sunny hills, Or indolently laid, remote from view, To court the woodland muse, with jocund reed, And never more the sorrowing strain renew? Ah, Henrietta! much I hop'd for thee, With other notes to wake the woodland choir, When Time had seen thy full-blown charms entire, Transplanted hence, to deck another mold, Had seen thy virtues hold; Their tenour, bright'ning on for many a year, But Heav'n forbids the tear; Heaven saw, perhaps, some dim disaster wait, Far in the bosom of futurity, And kindly seal'd the seeming stern decree! Thine was the blooming wreath of early worth, And every choicest boon that Heaven bestows; No dark contagion check'd them in the birth, Untainted, fair, the vigorous stems arose: Not such as aged Penitence uprears, A puny growth, besprent with sickly tears, When half the vigour of the soul is flown! Ye parents hear, and mark the warning song, Time, as he steals along, And marks the infant mind, with weeds o'ergrown, Shakes the hoar head, and waves th'impeaching scroll, Then hurries frowning to th'eternal goal. Fair soul! it was not half thine early praise, That every ornamental grace was thine, The vivid pencil and the chorded shell, Whatever charms, in these degenerate days, That unexhausted mine, Seen only by thy brethren of the skies, Was hid from common eyes! Thy soul, was all harmonious as thy lyre, She was a great proficient in music, and remarkably fond of sacred poetry.Thy lyre, attun'd to David's leading strain, Or Asaph's lute, when full of heavenly fire, The anthem swell'd beneath his skilful hand, And halleluias loud, were heard to ring, Revolving, length'ning thro' the choral band. Warm Faith, and Hope, inspir'd thy angel song, 'Twas Faith that bade thy infant hand explore The sacred leaves, and trace their sense along; While on the lap reclin'd of flow'ry May, Thine equals languish'd out the livelong day, Or led the dance, or dar'd, devoid of fear, To weave the amorous snare; 'Twas then, when all enjoy'd the social hour, The seraph Hope, in saintly stole array'd, Oft led thee forth, to some sequester'd bow'r, To talk, with her, of heavenly things unseen, Where she and angels shar'd the hallow'd shade; 'Twas there, alas! from this sublunar scene, She often used to retire from company to her private devotions.At the stol'n hour, the sad divorce was made. Not always thus, in lonely bow'r immur'd, Meek Charity! thy soul expanding beam, Found thy sweet pupil lost to human ties, Reckless of earth, conversing with the skies; From Want's pale eye, from Pity's melting claim, And Poverty's imploring call, secur'd; With ready ear, she heard the orphans pray'r, With stealthy hand, she dealt the lib'ral boon, And priz'd the power, to wipe the widows tear, Whatever pecuniary present the young lady received, she either distributed among the poor, or bought religious books, for the instruction of the young and ignorant in the neighbourhood. O'er all the joys that fleet beneath the moon; O'er all that charms the eye, or sooths the ear. For what are ye, ye transient gifts of Time, Compar'd with those that scorn the wasting year, Gifts from above, immortal as their clime; When the warm impulse to the soul is given, That bids her think of Heaven; When first th'unshackled soul is taught to soar, And launches from this dull, disastrous shore, A virgin, tracing out her upward course?— Ye living precepts! come! my song attest, That still survive, and warm the grateful breast. For well she lov'd the Pastor's hallow'd trade, Nor thought it much, to raise with gentle hand, Alluding to her care in instructing the younger maid servants (particularly one who had been an orphan) in the principles of religion.The lamb, deserted in the thorny glade, Or on the barren strand, At random cast, of mother's care forlorn, Nor Indolence, nor Scorn, Forbad the nymph, her orphan charge to tend, To ward the weakly wretch, from nightly spell; For she had charms to counterwork the guile, Of dæmon imp, and all the elvish train, Given by that ancient swain, Who bade the fisher leave his simple wile, And learn the mighty shepherd's flock to feed; Lake of Genassaroth.What time Tiberias' flood, from shore to shore, Heard the shrill summons of his vocal reed: From realm to realm, the thrilling call was heard, And alien flocks, a mighty train appear'd, Obsequious, list'ning to his magic lore. Unusual theme! in these inglorious days, When the dim cross, that whilom shone so bright, Scattering the fog of Superstition's night, So sickly seems to shed her waning light; And Irreligion, o'er her ancient right, The leaden sceptre sways! Yet deem'd ye not your pious labour lost, Blest pair! when o'er th'expiring saint ye hung, With all a parents woes, your bosoms wrung, And saw at once your fondest wishes crost! Not all the fading charms, by poets sung, Of ages, long expir'd, the empty boast, Could match the glories of thy dying bed!— Tho' Helen's fatal charms, on Asia's coast, Kindled, of old, the flame of wasting war; Tho' fierce Zenobia rul'd the rushing car, And Caria's Artemisia. Queen the line of battle led. Tho' great Eliza saw th'eternal bar, Of dashing waves, defend her favour'd strand, And quench in storms, the flaming wrath of Spain: Where now are all the mighty deeds they plann'd, Their names, to more than half the world unknown, In some old minstrel's song, preserv'd in vain, Or on some fragment of a mouldering stone, Not such the portion of the silent train. Favour'd by him, who fills the sapphire throne, Who led them onward thro' the vale of pain, Tho' their hard brethren scarce the wand'rers own. For them the saints prepare the splendid seat, Far, far, above the guilty and the great. More glorious far, to follow such a bier, And more your triumph, than in ermin'd pride To see her rais'd on Fortune's fickle sphere, With Flattery cringing by her chariot's side. The late Mrs. Digby, then Miss Mary Digby.And thou, sweet maid, who feel'st the knot unty'd, Which once united to thy faithful heart The lost companion of thy tuneful art, And mourn'st her fall, as some lone nightingale, Remote from view, the midnight groves among, With dying dirge renews her plaintive song, Tho' yet the recent pang thy heart assail, Tho' now thou tun'st a solitary string; Yet know, that still a sympathizing hand Attunes her virgin harp, to thine above, Among the choirs of love: These choirs, whose anthem seem'd a while to stand, When thro' their bands was heard the summons loud: “ Alluding to the fever of which she died.Go bid the flaming car, thy call obey, “And half the burning seat, ye seraphs! shroud, “Dispensing gently round a milder ray, “When yon fair saint resigns her mortal veil; “Go gently soothe away her tender fears, “And waft her up the sky on softest sail.” The wond'ring saints lean'd forward from their spheres, To see th'unusual pomp ascend the skies; And from their thrones, the hero and the seer, Names which had long ennobled many a clime, The saint, the chief, the mighty, and the wise, Exclaim'd “sure some unwonted birth of time, “Some soul, whose morals warm'd a languid age, “Some holy pastor comes, from care releast, “Some gifted bard, or deep reflecting sage; “Else why in haste, descends the fiery team, “Like that which bore the saint from Jordan's stream? “No sage or moralist, “a voice rejoins, “No pastor late releast, the call obeys, “No gifted bard his earthly load resigns, “And claims his wreath of Amaranthine bays! “A simple maid, unsung by mortal lays.” “In early youth, the blest assembly joins, “A fairer soul was ne'er dislodg'd by death, “Nor sought a purer mind the upward path. “Heaven on her soul its choicest gifts distill'd, “And blest with golden fruit the narrow span, “A few short years, with num'rous virtues fill'd “The genuine off'rings Heaven expects from man. “Early recall'd, to shew the thoughtless train, “Why still 'tis given the ling'rers to remain; “And what important posts they fill below, “How short, how insecure, their giddy reign, “Then why, ye languid triflers, why so slow? “Haste, seize the golden moments as they fly, “See! how the fugitives ascend the sky. “Minute your faults, and chide the fond delay, “Protracted long by many a faint essay!”— —Thus sung the youth Ophalia's glades among, Tuning his ditty to the doleful knell, Till now approaching near, the funeral throng, Darken'd the hill, and pour'd adown the dell: But when the plum'd hearse slowly pac'd along, His smother'd woe began afresh to swell, He turn'd him round, and wip'd the falling tear, Then slowly sad, pursued the passing bier. FINIS. ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. THOMAS STEWART, Son to Wm. Stewart, Esq; of Killymoon. LATE RECTOR OF HOWTH, AND PREBEND OF ST. PATRICK'S, DUBLIN, 1789. I. The scene of the Author's school-boy days was in the neighbourhood of Killymoon. Ye groves! whose umbrage to the rising sun, Romantic, falling o'er the dewy dell, And shadowing half way up the hills majestic swell, I us'd to mark, when Fancy first begun, To muse with wild, creative eye, On the rich scenes of earth and sky; Or view the meek, retiring day, Stealing in purple tints away; Or, when the world was hush'd asleep, And Dian climb'd the cloudless steep, Listening, with delighted ear, The deep stream's solemn fall to hear. Oh, Fairy stream, along whose daisied shore, I first the rising rapture prov'd, When Milton's epic numbers mov'd The master chords of young delight, And brought all Heaven before my sight. Hark! to yon deep-ton'd bell! those pleasures are no more! II. —Ye glades, where oft in evening walk, Methought, I heard the Dryads talk; Or seem'd to spy, at blush of day, The blue-stol'd naiads steal away, Before the sun's intruding eye, Their fairy gambols could espy. Ye hills! who lock'd your long embrace, Round that lov'd, sequester'd place; At whose majestic, mingled feet, Where Logri's stream, and Mona's meet, Stands the venerable dome, The good Palemon's ancient home; “How your echoes seem to languish “Mute, but to the voice of anguish!” III. Wizard stream! unknown to song, That thro' old Loughrea's solemn wood, O'er rude rocks flingst thy foaming flood; Tho' soon, thy waters quiet maze, Thro' the lovely vale delays. (Lovely vale! tho' still unsung, Unless some Doric reed obscure Piping near thy waters pure, Calls to dance the sylvan throng.) Along your hazle borders fair, How oft you heard the fervent prayer, And rustic vows, with holy strife, Ascending for the forfeit life! IV. Oh! early fallen! ere half your days were run! Long must I mourn thy unexpected doom; Did thy full blossoms court the morning sun, So soon to fall and wither on thy tomb? Was it for this, so oft you bent your way, With heaven-born charity, thy lov'd compeer; And meek Humanity, an hermit gray, From Want and Pain to wipe the falling tear?— Heedless of his lofty birth, Or proud of that sole title given, To dignify the race of earth, “The delegate of bounteous Heaven. Scorning Ambition's wild career, The noisy bar, the tempting main, Where Av'rice spreads the sail for gain, Following the journies of the year. He chose the shepherd's humble fold, He chose to guide the simple swain, Thro' the long sequester'd way, That leads to everlasting day.— —Long, long I have not seen that daisied shore, Yet there fond Memory loves at times to dwell; Haunts of my childhood! half your charms are o'er, Ye Fairy streams! and haunted woods! farewell! V. Her plunder'd nest the stock dove mourns, Her bright'ning day is soon o'ercast; But soon the tide of Hope returns, And his instinctive pangs are past.— Not so, the fond and virtuous pair, By Wisdom and Religion taught, Gently to rear the tender thought; And, (as the mind expands apace,) With every virtue, every grace, The tissue of the soul to blend, And raise the pupil to a friend. Theirs is the pang—when in the zephyr's breath, The viewless messenger of death, While Hope and Joy are smiling round, Deals the dark insidious wound. Malignant Fate sits by and smiles, While yet the florid cheek and sparkling eye, The hope of every friend beguiles, And promises a long arrear of joy. And hid beneath the placid mien, The subtle miner lurks unseen. VI. Theirs is the pang—but oh! much honour'd pair! Think not your pious, fond, parental care, Your early joy, your early boast, Your kind solicitudes are lost!— —Old Time, a glad return will yield, To yonder hind that sows the field; Tho' now, to lawless chance a prey, He seems to fling his hopes away. —And shall the nobler toils that form the mind, Despair a due return to find, When he that tames th'unconscious clod, See tenfold gifts by Heaven bestow'd? No—your generous labours live, In brighter climes, they yet survive That power, which ripens earth to ore, Beneath Potosi's mountains hoar: That sees the sanguine ruby glow, In Golconda's gloom below; And bids a vagrant drop condense, An Orient pearl, with light intense; Shall behold thy labours crown'd, Tho' seeming sunk in night profound. Check the tear's incessant fall, And your living hopes survey. A long procession bright and gay; Led by him James Stewart, Esq; representative for the county Tyrone.—He made several campaigns in Germany, and behaved with uncommon intrepidity, when only a stripling., who nurst in arms, All alive to glory's charms, Fac'd the proud encroaching Gaul: And now the Senate sees him wield, Virtue's arms, in Freedom's field; Remember still his gallant stand, With that high distinguish'd band, When Usurpation own'd her fear, And crouch'd beneath Juverna's spear. Thus your living hopes recall, And check the tears incessant fall. FINIS. TO THE REV. DR. LESLIE, OF TANDRAGEE, COUNTY DOWN, ON A LATE MELANCHOLY EVENT IN HIS FAMILY, 1792. Would Heaven that Promethean art were mine, To bid the languid look revive again; O could the magic of the muses line, Lead health meand'ring thro' the seats of pain. Leslie! that mind which feels for others smart, For many a year had 'scap'd this cruel stroke, Till Pity's self had wish'd the soul to part, From Age's leaden gripe, and galling yoke. While others skim'd along the vernal road, Where fleeting pleasure led the hair-brain'd chace; She trac'd the dark vale to the lone abode, Where anguish hid her pale, autumnal face. Like the sweet bee, that from the dew-bent flower, Extracts the lymph, that crowns the cup of joy; From grateful tears she drew her nectar'd store, Then with her freight complete, she sought the sky. That glorious essence would'st thou wish to find, Here darkling fixt to mourn at others woe; Heaven's denizen, to slavish task assign'd, To bid a purple current ebb and flow?— Fond Sympathy, indeed, that heart could warm, The glow of friendship, and domestic joy; Hope's chearful tinge, on Sorrow's faded form, Seem'd all Elysium to her glist'ning eye. The Heavenly tenant of that gentle breast, Eternal vigour from the task inhal'd; But, the frail lodging of th'empyreal guest, Sunk, by the siege of unseen foes assail'd. Yet, what she was, in some distinguish'd hour, When meek Benevolence and Joy combin'd; When thro' each look, with soul-enchanting power, Beam'd the pure essence of th'æthereal mind. She now exceeds—Behold her where she moves, In the full noon of everlasting light!— Yon radiant crown each heavenly charm improves, With sapphires beam'd, unsufferably bright! Yon gems, that sparkle o'er her flowing vest, Are grateful tears, in heavenly mines congeal'd; While in the swelling anthems of the blest, Wond'ring, she hears, her modest worth reveal'd. Wond'ring, she sees, in that resplendent robe, Emblazon'd by the pencil of the skies, Her deeds, while yet she walk'd this nether globe, Tended by fervent prayers, and glist'ning eyes. Thee too, the crown and splendid robe attend, (If aught the muse beholds, of things above;) Even now the texture grows, the colours blend, For other nuptials, midst the choirs of love. The heavenly artist tends thy steps below, (An unseen form, but by the gifted sight,) Who, in the tints of Heaven's unfading bow, Sketches thy virtues, as they rise to light! Swift pursuivants, the pictures waft away, Where, far above, the glorious texture grows, Glittering in bright diversities of day, And heavenly looms thy storied life compose. Still grows the texture, may it long extend, Till thy late progeny thy virtues learn! Celestial visitant! thy charge attend, And soothe with whispers bland, his deep concern! Long may his fond, paternal eyes survey, The sainted mother in the daughter smile; And may the Author of this grateful lay, From such a model learn to raise his style. FINIS. ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR JOHN RAWDON, LATE EARL OF MOIRA, JUNE, 1793. No venal bard, with personated pain, And studied Sympathy's fictitious glow, Presumes to mingle with the mourning train, Intrusive on their dignity of woe. Not many moons have taught the azure tide, In deeper deluge on our shores to roll, Since, in that social circle, he enjoy'd “The feast of Reason, and the flow of soul.” That gloomy warning of the sinking mind, (Which oft forebodes, when heaven-sent ills impend) With dumb, internal prophecy, divin'd, (Ere Rumour spoke) the parting of a friend. Pensive I sit, and ask the midnight breeze, How she supports the shock, that sever'd life; And Fancy still, in mournful vision, sees Her feelings, and her fortitude at strife. Oh! how with soft Solicitude she strove, To draw the barbed shaft of length'ned pain; To smooth his couch, with kind, connubial love, And gild the gloom of Sorrow's dark domain! What need for her such deep and poignant woe? Must she?—but Heaven forbids to scan our fate, Nor yet allows the various ends to know, For which she proves us, in this mortal state. Support her, Heaven! for she that feels for all, As spirits feel, from earthly dregs refin'd: How was she startled at the awful call? How bore the lacerations of the mind? Support her, Heaven! for thou alone canst shed That holy balm, that heals th'internal wound; And bid th'enlight'ned soul, devoid of dread, Look o'er the gloomy world's mysterious bound. To those, whose converse most he lov'd below, The great, the good, the useful, and the wise, Who here vouchsaf'd a visit to bestow, Their fated task perform'd, and sought the skies. For not like gaudy insects of an hour, Who waste in trifles, Time's penurious boon; He learn'd to manage well the frugal dower, And liv'd whole ages in a single moon. His Lordship's literary acquisitions exhibited an extent and variety which marked a great comprehension and activity of mind, and a memory uncommonly tenacious.To that fair morn, when first the sun look'd forth, His mind, pursuing up the maze of time, Saw social Life, and Science, in their birth, And mark'd, with studious eye, their march sublime. The lamp he lighted, by Experience given, At those twin stars that glimmer'd o'er the waste; And, like Prometheus, dealt the boon of Heaven Around, and show'd the future in the past. From this, he learn'd the dignity of man; From this, his duties, and his claims he knew; And, from the study of the mighty plan, The richest stores of mingled knowledge drew. His polish'd manners spread a social ease, Round the gay circle of his festal board; Even in the lap of pain, he strove to please, Improv'd the subject, or the theme restor'd. He lov'd the muse: his kind, protecting hand, Cherish'd her labours with parental care: He strove to plant the arts on Eirin's strand, And hop'd to see them brave the rigorous air. 'Twixt Factious frenzy, and imperial power, He took, like Publius, Publius Valerius Publicola. his determin'd stand, With Roman spirit fraught, and Attic lore, Full in the vaward of the patriot band. His shield has left its place, in Tamor's hall; His column strip'd of all its scutcheon'd pride.— —But Hasting's arms, with his, shall deck the wall, That crest of eagle plume, to crowns ally'd. Ah! could thy country claim thee for her own! Could'st thou descend to low, provincial care!— But claims imperial, calls of high renown, And more extensive plans thy bosom share! Our Senate waits, to give thy virtues room, Thy sires' and country's friends, thy presence greet; But thy lov'd England points the wreath to come, And calls thee hence to fill a nobler seat. Fancy, beholds thee in a nobler seat, Whence thy wide range of vision might divine, Where best our long, discordant claims should meet; Like blended colours, in one radiant line. SPECIMEN OF THE CAPTIVES, A ROMANCE, (READY FOR THE PRESS.) The exordium gives a short view of the invasion of England by the Danes, in the tenth century, and their defeat by Alfred. XIII And now the hurricane was over blown, And to the North retir'd the ruffian blast: Again the victor climb'd the regal throne, With Scandinavian spoils superbly grac'd, And o'er old England's harrast plains, at last, The dawn of Freedom led the golden day, While, tir'd of arms, the power of battles cast His polish'd helm and brigantine away, And thro' the summer groves, pursu'd the sylvan prey. XIV With clamorous hounds, to chace the flying doe, The Royal Alfred. Saxon, on a summer morn, (While yet the welkin wore a crimson glow) Awoke the woodland choirs with jocund horn. And Sol, at last, by flaming coursers borne, Emerging from the pomp of woods afar, Began, in umber'd radiance to adorn The wide, delightful scene, of sylvan war, From Windsor's purple hills, to Dover's chalky bar. XV Following the chace, along the opening vale, Which points its bosom to the passing flood, They saw a brigantine, with easy sail, Which up majestic Thames it's course pursu'd, Borne on the swelling tide: the hunters stood, And saw the strangers slack the toiling oar, Awhile, the wond'ring bands each other view'd, At length the hardy sailors sought the shore, And in the friendly creek, the wave-worn vessel moor. XVI Forth from the Royal retinue, with speed, At Alfred's word, a youthful Baron sprung; And, as the strangers crost the level mead, With hasty words addrest the weary throng: “Whence are ye, friends! that venture thus along Those hostile waters, with forbidden prow; No more the sons of violence and wrong, Around our shores in sable squadrons go, Or dare to ravage here, since Denmark's overthrow!” XVII He spoke, and thus the senior of the band, “Say, ere we answer, has our search an end? We seek the sovereign of this happy land, And at the awful throne adoring bend? When first we saw this noble train descend, Thro' the green forest, to the azure flood, In glad presage, we deem'd the royal friend Of Liberty, the sylvan chace pursu'd, To this delightful shore, along the ecchoing wood.” XVIII O gallant youth! confirm this augury, And take the thanks of this o'erlabour'd train! From Old name of Ireland. Iverdon, beyond the western sea; We come, the aid of Alfred to obtain, To rescue from the foe, our lost domain, Who rages in the centre of our isle; Where after many battles fought, in vain, He lords it o'er Juverna's choicest spoil, While scarce the slender bands support the strenuous toil.” XIX The wond'ring youth the foreigners survey'd, And gently thus return'd: “Ye guess'd aright! Come! follow me to yonder welcome shade, Where yon broad sycamore excludes the light, For now the burning sun ascends the height Of Heaven, and yonder halts the royal crew.” In grateful thanks for this auspicious sight, They bow to Heaven, and straight their guide pursue, Where the attendant train the slaughter'd quarry drew. XX There sate the Saxon Lord, in royal state, And saw his train prepare the rich repast; But now, the messenger of Eirin's fate, By the young Baron led, with fervent haste, To the green summer hall of Audience prest; And kneeling low, with supplicating strain, With pious tears, and ardent prayers, addrest The warlike Chief, of England's wide domain; And thus began the guide of Eirin's suppliant train: XXI “Father of Freedom! Hear the fervent prayer Of Iverdon, Old name of Ireland. that calls aloud for aid! While Windsor's woods resound the sylvan war, And the brown tenants of the summer shade, Lead on the flying chace, from glade to glade. Far other sounds, Ierne's echoes tell, There Scandinavia's sons in slaughter wade; While from the breezy hill, and winding dell, Borne on the sighing gale, the notes of anguish swell.” XXII “O leave the flying wolf, and timorous doe, And spend your fury on a nobler game! The Dane will meet your lance, a daring foe, And add new glories to your deathless name. Soon as the winds your mighty march proclaim, The sacrilegious raven quits her prey, And, when you lance abroad the bolted flame Mounts on the winged winds, and sails away, Like Night's ill omen'd birds, before the shafts of day!” XXIII Irresolute the royal warriour stood, While Memory call'd to view, the hated forms Of burning towns, and fleets, and fields of blood, And nightly ambuscades, and wild alarms. His hardy train, tho' terrible in arms, Yet shudder'd at the sound of Denmark's name; All who remember'd how the Northern swarms, On their pale strand, like inundations, came, And spread along the shore like wide, consuming flame. XXIV They saw the Saxons doubt, and thus again The hoary messenger renew'd his plea: “Think on the moment, when the cruel Dane, Sagacious of your flight, from sea to sea Pursu'd your steps, when sacred The island where Alfred lay concealed during his adversity. Athelney, By many a marsh, and sounding flood secur'd, The last retreat of parting liberty; Preserv'd the reliques of the conqu'ring sword, And in her solemn shades her flying King immur'd.” XXV “Who bade the guardian spirit of the night, Wake in her lonely moors the lamping blaze, That led the Danes, with long, fallacious light, Far from the path, in many a winding maze, Where never mortal trode the faithless space; While the green sward, that felt unusual weight, With horrid chasm, their flying march betrays; And all at once, ingulfs the living freight, While Ivar Ivar, the Danish General. blam'd their stay, unconscious of their fate.” XXVI “He, whose nocturnal flame, and cloud by day, Secur'd thy safety, now thine arm demands! To shield his holy cause, and hold at bay, The baffled rage of Scandinavia's bands. That power, whose mandate mov'd the shifting sands, And fleets and armies from the port repell'd, Requires the help of thy victorious hands! Forbid it, Heaven! the Dane should brave the field, While Alfred hunts the doe, in summer woods conceal'd! XXVII “If pure Religion at thy footstool bends, And seeks thine aid, to hold the foe at bay; Oh! think thy life was sav'd for nobler ends, Than with the herd of Kings, to spend in play, The fleeting hours of Life's uncertain day. To England's glory, and to Alfred's fame, Enough was given in many a bloody fray; Now, let Humanity thy valour claim, And our insulted Faith thy pious mind inflame!” XXVIII Fir'd at the bold address, the courtier crew, Murmur'd, and look'd intolerable scorn; But the great Regent, to whose mental view, The gradual chain of events yet unborn; Rose in clear series, like the dawning morn, To the sage Envoy thus his answer gave: “Ierne's unexampled woes I mourn; And, could my single arm her millions save, The Scandinavian soon should fill the longing grave!” XXIX “But well ye know, the general voice must aid The feeble movements of my bounded sway; For here no King, in barb'rous pomp array'd, With arbitrary nod, can raise or lay Bellona's storm at will: But sage delay, And public wisdom, strikes a surer wound. The states assemble with the coming day, Where fair Augusta shows her hallow'd mound, Then to the wise Divan your embassy propound.” XXX He spoke, with reverence low, the suppliant band Depart, and soon the brigandine ascend; The jolly hunters, at their King's command, To fair Augusta's walls their journey bend; Behind, in close debate, as friend with friend, The King with Landin rode, a Neustrian Knight, In peaceful arts and arms completely train'd, With whom he us'd to share the social rite, And on his converse dwelt with ever new delight. XXXI For well he knew, with serious themes, or gay, To suit the moment, and the man to please; And ev'ry land he knew, from Gibraltar. Calpes bay, To where The Weser in Germany Visurgis meets the northern seas: And all the glories past of Rome and Greece, And ev'ry scene renown'd of modern days, Were his; and well he knew the mind to seize, With the resistless charm of artful praise, On which the sagest mind with ling'ring love delays. XXXII And well he knew to ward, with ready thought, Impending peril, or elude the blow; With stratagems and wiles innumerous fraught, To baffle or surprize the raging foe. And well he knew to bid the passions glow, Or soothe, to sudden calm, the ductile mind; The royal Saxon seem'd his worth to know, Often dependant on his arts refin'd, When perils, mustering round, against his peace combin'd. XXXIII Him Alfred lov'd, but cautious still, and just, Resolv'd his favourite's honour to explore, And find, if public love, or sacred lust Of sway, his bosom rul'd with sovereign power; Ere he disclos'd to light the hallow'd store, Of sapient counsels in his breast conceal'd.— —Then musing, as they trac'd the level shore; A crisis fit, the prudent chief beheld, And thus, with aspect grave, his seeming views reveal'd. XXXIV “How blest the Ministers of Life and Light, Whose flaming charity can never fail, For lack of means!—But we, immerst in night, And doom'd to wander this sublunar vale, Where, for a day, we fill the lowest scale Of intellectual life, lament to see, Passion, and Prejudice, and Fear prevail; And sordid Self, with interested plea, Against the struggling soul's seraphic energy.” XXXV “Oh! were it mine!—the soul-ennobling spell, With solitary voice to wake the war; Soon should resounding Fame my trophies tell, And purple conquests guide my lofty car! Nor should the haughty Lord of Denmark dare To waft his levy'd legions o'er the main!— —But oh! the cruel Fates have plac'd a bar Before my hopes!—and Law's unfeeling train Baffles my ardent prayer, and bids me wish in vain!” XXXVI “How do I burn to share the bloody fray, And meet with mutual shock my ancient foe; But Senates interpose, with cold delay, And dull debates retard the falling blow. Tho' this hoar head be sprinkled o'er with snow, Yet do I love, with sudden powers combin'd To bear destruction on my sounding prow, And leave the flying march of Fame behind, Till Old name of Denmark. Lochlin, in her doom, my dread arrival find!” XXXVII In thought, the fond believing minion spy'd, In Alfred's sudden wish, his inmost mind; And, all too credulous his joy to hide, The secret byas of the King to find: Like a light skiff that veers with every wind, Thus sooth'd the purpose of the royal soul: “Shall narrow laws the heavenly temper bind? Shall human ties the hero's hand controll, Fitted to spread his sway from Indus to the Pole?” XXXVIII “Oh Alfred! seize at once the golden hour, That bounteous Heaven by Eirin's doom bestows; England shall build thy formidable power, A power, so dreadful to her ancient foes!— The state must raise a barrier, to oppose The fierce invasion of the cruel Dane; And, taught on thy firm valour to repose, Shall yield to thee, and thy victorious train, The sovereignty, by land, and fasces of the main!” XXXIX “Levy thy legions! and if deep Surmise, With jealous eye, thy purpose seem to dread; Point to the tempest in the northern skies, Threat'ning afar, and gathering to a head. Tell of Ierne's plains, with slaughter red! Show how the conflagration rolls along, Still with a large supply of fuel fed. Till Britain's sons, and Gallia's martial throng, Shall scarce repel the tide of Violence and wrong!” XL “Like Julius, thus the trembling senate fill, With constant rumours of invasions nigh; And dark presages in their hearts instill, From all the quarters of the angry sky. Let their great edict bid thy banners fly, And teach the frighted isle thy need to know; Yet, suffer not thy legions long to lye In torpid sloth, but bid their ardour glow On Gaul's unguarded coast, or Scandinavia's snow!” XLI “Old England, soon accustom'd to the sight, Their glorious arbiter shall learn to boast, And view thy armaments, with proud delight, The guards of Freedom call'd on every coast; Till, by degrees, their apprehension lost, In sweet oblivion of insulting war; Thy skilful hand, unthought, and unopposed, With master-movement winds the silken snare Around their torpid limbs, and crowns reward thy care!” XLII “Oh! Alfred! then thy strong benevolence, No more by Senates awed, by forms confin'd, Shall sally round the world, like light'nings glance, And match the emanations of thy mind!— —The Regent of the day, in light enshrin'd, Shall stop awhile her burning wheels, to see The fasces of his favour'd isle, resign'd By the immediate hand of Heav'n, to thee, Whilst Love, and filial Fear, applaud thy victory!” XLIII Some moments, lost in thought, the Monarch stood, While Indignation, join'd with generous Shame, O'er his warm cheek suffus'd the mantling blood, And shook with sudden throes his manly frame. At length, he cry, “Oh Wisdom! Heavenly flame! In love detach'd, from the primæval light, To guide our feet, and lift the mortal name, By just gradations, to an angel's height; How are thy glories sunk in unsubstantial night?” XLIV “I ask not power, nor love despotic sway, That slippery boon, so much by mortals sought; Nor, ask I Reason's clear unclouded ray, Content to share the less invidious lot Of virtuous lore, by Heaven, in mercy taught To erring man, his fault'ring steps to guide! Be Memory! Fancy! Intellect forgot! All bounteous Heaven! the dangerous talent hide If thus ev'n Reason falls to ruin, missapply'd!” XLV “How oft thy words, like op'ning summer, clear'd The clouds, that settled on the deep debate! How oft, assisted by thy skill, I steer'd Thro' swallowing sands, the vessel of the state! Thou subtle, mining spirit! seen too late! O say what spell, in what portentous hour, Led thee to brave the storm of public hate; To mar thy vintage in th'unfolding flower, To taint my honour first, and then abuse my power?” XLVI “Unhappy man! with all thy matchless sense, Thou saw'st not how I led thee to thy shame; And now, what subterfuge? what weak pretence Canst thou suggest to veil thy blasted fame? Go! in oblivion hide thy hated name; Thy name, once glorious! now alas! how lost! And know, thy injur'd King would rather claim, In Freedom's band, his delegated post, Than all the royal pomp of Asia's splendid coast!” XLVII “Go! thou ill-fated man! thy merits past, Ward from thy head the well deserved doom! But from the hostile plains of Albion, haste! Wherever Fortune leads thy steps to roam The land of Liberty denies a home To such as thee!—and may she still deny Even the asylum of a quiet tomb, To that foul hand that labours to untye The hallow'd cords that bind her freeborn family!” XLVIII He spoke, and turn'd away:—With guilty shame Opprest, the favourite found his utterance fail; Nor dar'd an audience of the King to claim, His guilt to clear; but down the winding vale His courser turn'd, while shadowy ev'ning pale Wav'd o'er the purple hills her banner gray: Meantime, the Monarch, in a flowery dale, Joining his jolly troop, at close of day, To fair Augusta's walls conducts the long array. XLIX Too generous failing of the manly breast?— The children yet unborn shall rue the day, When Alfred's pitying hand the wretch releast, And sent him, like a pestilence, away, Over the unsuspecting world to stray, At large, in specious Virtue's fair disguise! Thus the fair mirrour, with fallacious ray, Allures the sweet lark from the liquid skies, And brings the warbler down, ah! never more to rise. L Landin the courtiers mist, but nought enquir'd, For oft the King, on expedition bent, When any sudden call the thought inspir'd, On errands of deep trust his fav'rites sent: And oft the night, her cloudy curtain lent, From prying Fame, their stealthy march to hide. Thoughtful the Monarch seem'd, and all intent On public cares, as thro' the portal wide, And down the crowded way he led the living tide. LI In revelry and sport, the evening clos'd, Sweet relaxation of their woodland toil! Then leaden Sleep his soothing spell impos'd On every sense:—But Alfred, yet awhile, Smit with the sufferings of the Sainted Isle, And anxious for the coming day, withstood The pleasing charm; and by the wasting oil Of the nocturnal lamp, at large, pursu'd His salutary schemes of wide-diffusive good. LII Then, closing all with prayer, the royal sage, To the primæval cause his vows addrest; “O thou! whose power on this sublunar stage, Me, all unfit, with regal honours grac'd; And, by my hand, the cruel Dane represt; Accept my thanks, that from a deadlier foe, Pride, and the lust of power, thy love releast Thy delegate, commission'd here below, To bid thy blessings round in equal measure flow!” LIII “So may I ever by cælestial sight, From coward Doubt, and wild Ambition clear; 'Twixt the extremes, direct my course aright, And thro' the dreadful shelves securely steer! Still may I scorn the selfish call to hear, When Duty pleads, or Glory points the way: Or pure Religion, from her radiant sphere Descends, with Freedom at her side, to pray Her champion's aid, in arms, to chace the fiend away!” LIV The Monarch thus his aspirations breath'd, While, kept at distance by the solemn prayer, The power of Slumber stood; then softly wreath'd Around the regal brow, with gentle care, The poppy crown, and many a vision fair, Of op'ning glory, sooth'd the godlike breast: There first, the fluctuating pomp of war, The fairy scene in countless horrours drest, Then golden days come on, and images of rest. LV But not compos'd by images of rest, The Landin. Gallic fugitive, by Conscience driv'n, To Edric's stately hall his course addrest, Beneath the midnight frown of angry Heaven; Already the reproof, by Alfred giv'n, Fermented deep, and fir'd his haughty mind, Nor long his passions kept the balance even; But soon to dark Revenge the scale enclin'd, Which soon he thought to sate, with haughty Edric join'd. LVI Edric was born of Ina, King of Wesser, the common ancestor of Alfred and Edric. Ina's royal blood, Factious in peace, but nameless in the field. He still, with causeless spite, the King pursu'd Whose eagle-winged merit oft compell'd The reverence of immortal hate, and held Her foes in awe; but haughty Edric thought His elder line, by policy expell'd From England's throne, and each occasion sought, By clamour, force, or fraud, to cross the royal vote. LVII Astonish'd to behold his look of care, The malecontent receiv'd his midnight guest, Who told how Alfred, with the morning star, Meant to convene the Saxon Thanes in haste, To treat of Eirin's call, by war opprest: And in ambiguous phrase he seem'd to tell Some foul concealment lab'ring in his breast; Some dark design conceiv'd in lowest hell, And nourish'd by the King, his subjects rights to quell. LVIII And Friendship seem'd with Honour to contend, Whether the secret to conceal, or show; Yet seem'd his keen, expressive look to lend A dark, malignant light, that led to know The secret meaning of his smother'd woe. And flash'd conviction on the kindling mind Of Ina's heir, who saw a deadly blow, Or thought he saw, at Liberty design'd, And many an image foul of latent fraud combin'd. LIX Again the Lord of Day illum'd the pole, And all the godlike energies of mind; And all the tyrants of the human soul, Envy, and Love, and Hope, and Fear, combin'd; And Intellect, and Fancy, unconfin'd, Touch'd into being by the heavenly ray, Rush'd into life, like the imprison'd wind: And first Juverna's sons prevent the day, And to the solemn dome pursue their dubious way. LX The valves unfold; the Senatorial band, With din confus'd, the solemn passage throng, And range in order due, on either hand, Around the throne, with Danish trophies hung. But soon, by acclamations loud and long, The coming father of the state was told: “Father of Freedom! Hail!” from every tongue Was heard, and myriads crowded to behold Their King, as down the lines the long procession roll'd. LXI Arriv'd, he sate, and soon the mournful sound Of Supplication in the hall was heard; And soon Juverna's train, with awe profound, Before the assembled Potentates appear'd; And told their tale, in deep distress preferr'd; Then leave the presence, and their sentence wait Abroad, with rising hope alternate chear'd, And fear deprest, while long in close debate, Britannia's mighty Thanes, with godlike Alfred sate. LXII “Fellows in arms,” the placid Monarch said, “Ye hear Ierne's call, her fervent plea; Her hamlets and her folds in ruin laid, And desolation spread from sea to sea. There Odin's sons, elate with victory, Follow the banners of the ruthless God. And shall we bear their horrid blasphemy, That the great founder of our faith, o'eraw'd, Suffers the savage foe to waste his fair abode?” LXIII “To us, who saw reveal'd, his thund'ring arm And all the pageants of his power display'd Strong is the solemn call! the loud alarm That leads us hence, the falling cross to aid! Nor shall the arduous business be delay'd By me, nor will I plead my years decline; Soon shall the wish of England be obey'd, Whether, in arms, our western friends to join, Or to some younger Chief, the glorious post resign.” LXIV First Redowald, in prudent counsels old, Arose, of large and comprehensive mind; But his tame spirit sunk, by caution cool'd, And artful schemes, and politics refin'd; On that sad morning, ere the battles join'd On Wilton's Where the English had met with a total defeat by the Danes, Anno. 871. Moor, his too sagacious care, Dishearten'd England, while the Dane, combin'd With bold The Welsh of Merionethshire. Mervinia's legions, rush'd to war, And Mercia lost the day, and fled the field afar. LXV “Is there no charm in peace, or peaceful toils, That thus in search of ill we roam the flood, And wing our way to the surrounding isles, Like vultures, following far the scent of blood? For evermore pursuing or pursu'd?— —The gods, my friends! a floating barrier drew Around our shores, and built a bulwark rude, Of cilffs embattled high, in dreadful view, From England, to repell the bold invasive crew.” LXVI “This awful theatre, by nature made, The circle of our glory seems to bound; Then let us, ere our Pagan foes invade, This little respite seize, in peace profound, And glad repose, to heal our ancient wound; Nor dare to tempt the Scandian arms again, Nor think the trump of fame will cease to sound Britannia's martial deeds, by land and main, The triumphs of our King, and Denmark's broken chain.” LXVII “O rather let us hear, with ev'ry moon, The noise of battle ring around our coast, Young Eldred cry'd “Than soil our trophies won, With torpid sloth, and leave our gallant host To linger out their lives, to glory lost; And, in the tempest of the nations, sleep! Till Denmark, and Norwegia, unopposed, With their Milesian allies, cross the deep, The long expected meed of many an age to reap!” LXVIII “Should Freedom's call, and warm Compassion fail, With Piety combin'd, your souls to bend; Yet, let the voice of policy prevail, Your idle legions, o'er the sea to send, And, with the sons of Iverdon, defend The common bounds, 'gainst the common foe. In vain, alas! with Sitric you contend, In vain your navies meet with tilting prow, If sad Ierne sinks beneath the menac'd blow. LXIX “In vain, old Ocean guards your threat'ned land, With all her chosen terrours frowning round; In vain your native valour dyes the strand With Danish blood, returning wound for wound. If Eirin's breezy hills, and dale's profound, And flowery lawns, with lowing herds replete, And mountains blue, with piny chaplets crown'd Old Denmarks powers renew, and freight her fleet, While her embosom'd bays afford a safe retreat!” LXX “I see, from all her ports, the sable swarm Insult our frontiers, and our fleet repell. I see her hundred mouths emit the storm, Like Hecla's Hill, or flaming Etna. Mongibel, Then re-admit them, like the gorge of hell, When English valour threats the baleful brood! Till rallying from the long-retreating dell, Or gloomy grove, with spirit unsubdu'd, Their legions launch again, and hide the western flood.” LXXI “To arms, to arms,” the gallant Esmond cry'd, “And tear from Dania that distinguish'd prize, Ere in our trembling ports their navies ride, Or on our walls her sable standard flies. To us, old Iverdon, for aid applies, Her homage, our protection best will pay; Let Reigning King of Ireland. Hermon's son, by old experience wise, To England's care, resign the rescu'd prey, England, accustom'd long to hold the Dane at bay.” LXXII “And, who the bloody purchase ought to share, With honourable toil, by England bought? Who guards the common bulwark of the war, But she, that saves Milesius' ancient lot, Free to her sons?”—The whole assembly caught, With kindling rapture, thunder'd loud applause, Till Ardulph rose, and audience calm besought; Ardulph, the friend of man, and Freedom's cause, Whose steady wisdom still maintain'd her sacred laws. LXXIII “Ignoble thought! unworthy Albion's race!— For the poor title to an harrast shore, To sell our proud alliance, and deface That blazonry of fame, our fathers wore! If warlike Hengist, thus, in days of yore, His mercenary aid, to England sold, No heavenly precept tam'd her lust of power, No equitable thought his arm controll'd, No Christian Law, so called from the famous gospel precept—Do unto others as you would they should do unto you. law of sympathy, his proud ambition cool'd!” LXXIV “Shall she, like ruffians, on the desart strand, When angry Neptune scales the bending skies, Forbid the toiling mariner to land, Heedless of prayers, and agonizing cries, Unless he gives away the golden prize, The last, sad relique of his naval hoard?— O let us yet revere the sacred ties, That fasten man to man, with firm accord, Nor cause of obloquy to Alfred's name afford.” LXXV He spoke, in murmurs low, the list'ning crowd, Their dubious praise, and mingled censure spoke; But See st. 54. &amp;c. Edric next, his gloomy aspect show'd, A soul of sullen fire, that scorn'd the yoke Of regal sway, nor 'vail'd his lofty look, To Kesar, or to King, whoever frown'd: From Landin, late, a dark surmise he took, Of some foul pest, from Eirin's vales profound, That aim'd the lofty stem of Liberty to wound. LXXVI He rose, and in his look defiance flamed, And jealousy, matur'd to lasting hate; And thus, aloud, the malecontent exclaim'd: “Ye gallant Thanes! that love Britannia's state, I see the closure of this deep debate, Pregnant with ills! I see the fabric fair, Of Liberty, beneath the whelming weight Of foreign trophies lost, and needless war, While ages toil in vain, her ruins to repair!” LXXVII “Pardon! Alfred. thou generous friend to England's weal, Whose strenuous arm, with more than mortal might, Was seen to check the adamantine wheel, Turn'd by the daughters of eternal night, That spun our purple doom! our lowly plight To laurel'd triumphs, and convivial joys Thy prowess turn'd! But now a sudden blight, Sent from the awful Regent of the skies, Sickens our summer blooms, and all the year destroys.” LXXVIII “As some pale warriour, when the fever's fire, With scenes of battle fills the madding brain, Longs to put on Bellona's fresh attire, To reap the harvest of the bloody plain, And try the tumult of the field again: Dreaming his strength return'd, while fell disease New threds his nerves, and boils in every vain; Thus, the fair visions of fallacious peace, Tempts us our arms to try beyond the western seas!” LXXIX “Can we forget the foe, whose labour tills The Mercian vallies, and the East Anglia, Sunward Mound, Who colonize along the sable hills Of Cumberland, and Cheviot's utmost bound, And Deira's plains to Neptune's stormy sound?— Half these are Danes, and like the brooding storm, Wait but the heavenly sign, to spread around Tumult, and disarray, and loud alarm, Tho' now they seem withheld by Alfred's dreaded arm.” LXXX “I see the living rancour of their eye, (Tho' now beneath the yoke they seem to bend) Like the red promise of the evening sky, The tempest of the coming day portend.— Go now—to Eirin's woods your victims send, Where ruin lurks in deadly ambush near. Soon yonder clouds, that on your hills impend, And yet their desolating march forbear, Shall deluge all the plain, and mar the mellow year.” LXXXI “Ev'n tho' the terrour of the sanguine scourge, Should hold in awe the oft-defeated foe, While England's heroes o'er the sable surge, To green Ierne point the lofty prow; Yet Conquest calls alike, and Overthrow, For numerous legions still, and new supplies; Low droops proud Victory, with faded brow, And moulted plume, beneath yon weeping skies, If our too cautious hands the levied aid denies.” LXXXII “But, verst in plunder, and the waste of war, The veteran soon will scorn our peaceful toil; And, should some young, ambitious Prince, prepare To forge new fetters for his native isle, The warlike band, enured to annual spoil, To ruin'd provinces, and scenes of blood; And us'd to purchase the imperial smile By moonlight wars, beyond the western flood, Round the tyrannic flag, with chearful haste will crowd.” LXXXIII “Then sad Ierne to his standard won, Shall fling her legions in the Royal scale, And English freedom, like the waning morn, Shall waste away, or o'er the bosom pale Of Ocean, fleet before the rising gale, To other worlds, beyond the Western Main; Or, like an hermit, in Mervinia's vale, Live with the mountain hind and toiling swain, Their hamlets to protect against the ruffian train.” LXXXIV “Our laurel'd Chief, beneath the setting star, Shall teach the conquer'd clans the trade of blood, And from Ierne lead the moving war, To pale Britannia, o'er the toiling flood, A savage foe! while England, overaw'd, Falls to her parricides an easy prize, Our choicest blood and treasures sent abroad, To yonder climes that front the western skies, In vengeance shall return, with ever new supplies.” LXXXV “Thus shall our vital moisture drain away, By parching suns, in deadly blights return, Or, in contagious vapours blot the day, While our pale shores the dark Invasion mourn.— Rather let Eirin fall!—let Tamor burn!— Or bid their King resume his glory lost, And snatch the wreath away, by Dania worn Or send them hence, to Gallia's friendly coast, Against the common foe, to rouse the Celtic host.” LXXXVI “Perish the thought!” young Adelmar reply'd, “That Gaul should claim the honourable meed, The doom of conquered Eirin to decide, And with presumptuous hand their canvass spread, On our insulted seas! Let Dania bleed! Bleed England! Eirin! ere an alien power, From her blue promontories lift his head, And looks, with lordly frown, the ocean o'er, On the proud armaments that line our native shore!” LXXXVII Alfred arose, his generous heart was pain'd To find the sland'rous tongue attaint his fame; He, whose intrepid hand, so long sustain'd The drooping glories of Britannia's name. “My friends,” he cry'd, “No more assert the claim Of England's glory, or religion's aid, Since cold Suspicion damps the warriours flame, And candid Virtue, pines in Envy's shade, Let Denmark, ar her will, our trembling shores invade!” LXXXVIII “Say, is your love of freedom more than mine— Ungrateful men!—but let my deeds defend My wounded fame, for ne'er shall wreath entwine Those brows again, nor shall the Monarch blend His peaceful hours, with broils that never end, For transient glory, which the baleful breath Of pois'nous envy, to the dust can send, Or low-born jealousy, whose causeless wrath, Can touch with ranc'rous gall, the most unblemisht faith.” LXXXIX “Let the Milesians tell their harrast lord, That England's warlike thanes, with caution wise, No longer trust their saviour with the sword, Deaf to the prayers, the supplicating cries, Of Iverdon! regardless of the ties Of pure religion, and a common blood! For me, I here implore the awful skies, If Alfred e'er forgot the public good, Be his detested name with obloquy pursu'd!” XC “I too have friends! and soon could turn the tide Of clamorous faction, to demand the war, Or with my solitary voice, decide The long debate, and for the field declare! But my consummate glory well can spare The test, and much I scorn the little art, To win my people's vote, by means unfair! Be mine the empire o'er the willing heart! I love unbounded sway, and scorn to rule a part!” XCI “But ye! bold hearts in vain! whose gen'rous voice Is all for war, who scorn to wait the foe! In torpid sloth, beneath your native skies; But pass the barrier, and prevent the blow! If still your hearts with native ardour glow, In voluntary bands, to cross the main, Go! in the name of martial glory! go! With ardour new, inspire the harrast train, And with collected strength, repell the raging Dane!” XCII He ceast, and sate; a deep, portentous cloud, The sullen brow of Faction overhung; But now the hour dismist the martial crowd, And thro' the op'ning valves, the noble throng, In deep, unsocial silence, pac'd along. The sad Milesians stood in dumb despair, With grief, and generous indignation stung, To find their hopes of new-enkindled war, And all their prospects gone, like images of air.— End of the First Canto A band of Saxon Volunteers, under the command of Albert, a Northumbrian, embark for Ireland, to assert the natives against the Danes: They find peace restored, but are detained in Ulster by contrary winds. Now Calga's walls they gain'd where Nigel's care, With genial gifts, delay'd the gallant train; Viz. Albert and the Northumbrian Volunteers. Their navy now, from Curan's eastern bar Came round, and now the Saxon Lord again Resolv'd to man his fleet, and tempt the main, Since unexpected peace had sheath'd his blade. With hospitable care, the noble Thane, Nigel, Regent of Ulster. From day to day, the gallant youth delay'd, Till Albert's haste, at length, his fervent prayers outweigh'd. But now, as Heaven ordain'd, the wat'ry star, Which rules the flood, and bids the tempest rise, Gave the red signal to the windy war, And the deep ferment stain'd the angry skies. The fresh gale sunk, and soon the awful voice Of the Norwegian wind forbid the sail; Full thirty days it storm'd: The new allies: In Nigel'a hall, attend the vocal shell, That now no more was heard of bloody wars to tell. O vagrant muse! the wond'rous cause unfold, Which held Juverna's haughty foe at bay; And the proud wheels of victory controll'd, When hapless Iverdon at mercy lay, And seem'd to wait her doom? Upon a day, As The King of Denmark. Sitric led along his weary host, And thro' Ophalia's woods explor'd his way, Between two hills, with bow'ry shades embost, His long laborious march a strange adventure crost. Amid the music of the martial fife, They heard a pausing strain salute the ear, Along the vale. But soon, in tuneful strife, And concert full, arose the anthem clear, Harmonious psalmody, distinct and near! And soon emerging full, the cause was seen, An holy brotherhood, contemning fear, Led by their Lord, a man of awful mien, Forsook the gloomy shade, and crost the level green. But soon, as by an holy impulse driven, They wheel'd around, the pagan's march to meet; Like men, who seem'd to wait the will of Heaven, Wav'ring, the Scandians stood, nor dar'd to threat The holy train, who soon, with hasty feet Arrived, and stood in silence, van to van, While every heart a falt'ring measure beat; At length, the leader of the holy clan, Breaking the solemn pause, in accents slow began. “Paynim! behold th'inviolable Fair, The Christian Church. The baffled fury of her foes disdains, From her high battlements, with scornful air, She waves her hand aloft, and mocks thy pains; Not her thou tyrant, thy bold voice profanes, But him who made thee; him, whose sov'reign will, With matchless patience, still, thine arm sustains, Thy motions governs, and inspires thy skill, Tho', oft and oft, forewarn'd, a flagrant rebel still.” “Like thee, the minions of thy power blaspheme, And all thy frantic motions idolize; Thus, after thee, they chant the baleful theme. “Ye venerable groves; that proudly rise “Favorites of Heav'n! usurpers of the skies; “And you, ye pines! that fan the wint'ry air, “Whose giant height, the stormy north defies, “Sublimely waving to the windy war! “Alas! the edge comes down, which never knew to spare! “Where'er my legions sweep the sandy plain, “Perennial fountains scarce the draught supply, “The floods forget their journey to the main, “And sudden leave their gaping channels dry; “But hark! blasphemer; to thy lords reply! “Son of perdition! know thy abject birth, “Rais'd, like a meteor, to the wondering sky, “Or, like the whirlwinds of thy native north, “The rampires of my foes, to level with the earth. “For this, my light'nings wither'd all their force, “For this, their nerveless hands resign'd the spear, ‘As when red Sirius leads the sultry hours, “And fires to tenfold rage the fervid year! “They pin'd away, beneath the blast severe, “Like gray grass, waving o'er the ruin'd wall, “But now my bridle checks thy mad career; “Stand! harken! and obey thy sovereign's call, “Or the horizon round shall tremble at thy fall.” “Slacken thy march, and dread my injur'd name, “Thou scourge of angry Heaven! thy task is o'er! “Juverna's Lord, by long affliction tame, “Acknowledges the rod, and sins no more. “Thou wast not call'd to lay the realm in gore, “To sack his towns, and desolate the plain, “But, by the timely penance to restore “The chastis'd rebel to his God again, “And from the spreading taint, to vindicate his reign. “That power, whose nod arrests the rolling wave, “Who rules the whirlwind, and directs the storm; “Whose sovereign word the dread permission gave, “Which rous'd to blood thy far destroying arm, “Now sends his messenger, with mightier charm, “To take the temper from thy thirsty spear, “To bid thee sheath the sword, with slaughter warm, “And from thy brow thy bloody laurel tear; “Obey the present God, and stop thy mad career!” “Dreamer! avaunt!” the haughty Monarch cries, “Nor tempt the sword that spares thy trembling age.” “O thou, whose volleying thunder shakes the skies,” The sage exclaims, “behold the Scandian's rage, “And bid the heav'nly truth his heart engage: “Struck by that hand, which caus'd the rock to flow, “Let thy descending peace his fury suage, “And teach the haughty rebel to forego “The blood-stain'd diadem, that binds his haughty brow.” “Look up! fond man, and see the heav'nly sign, That shews how soon thy glories fleet away!” Just then, so well the brotherhood divine Had tim'd their message; o'er the orb of day, A dim eclipse began its gradual way, And ominous ev'ning, o'er the prospect clos'd, In slow solemnity, while deep dismay, In horror, stole along the Danish host, As Day's bright chariot hung in total darkness lost. The plumy choirs their sprightly carols ceast, And to th'asylum of the grove withdrew; And the wild woodland tenants went to rest, While the bright marshal of the starry crew, Undazzled by the day, look'd out to view, The dread defection of the solar light; And now, the sacred bands began anew, Their solemn descant, like the bird of night, That chears the lonely hours, remov'd from mortal sight. No murmurs thro' the shadowy host was heard, In holy horrour to the raptur'd strain; List'ning: At last a dubious glimpse appear'd, Of Sol, emerging from the dark domain Of Cynthia's orb, but then, the gladsome train, Chorus'd the light in Hallelujahs high: “Thus, thus, shall Faith and Freedom gild again, The wide horizon round with light and joy, When Dania's storms overblown, shall leave the light'n'd sky.” 'Twas then, the Pagan van began to melt, And down their polish'd arms, repentant, flung; Soon either wing the soft infection felt, Which run, like lambent flame, the ranks along; Till all in tears dissolv'd, the martial throng, As if they meant to wash their stains away, Around the holy man imploring throng, And for th'initial rite began to pray, To purge the taint of sin, which yet infecting lay. And first, the monarch dofft his shining mail, And first, the limpid stream obedient sought, Which stole in murmurs down the shady vale, Perennial spring! with cooling treasures fraught, Then all assembling round the sacred spot; The band, alternate, share the cleaning rite, Successive, by the holy brethren taught, Those truths, that broke the gloom of ancient night And chear'd the darken'd soul with intellectual light. Now Fame, that us'd of bloody broils to tell, The welcome news, to Eirin's Monarch bore, What wond'rous chance, the royal Dane befell, Met by his Saviour in the desart hoar. And he, profuse so late of human gore, Seem'd to renounce the desolating trade, A Christian now! a man of blood no more! Compell'd to sheath, his far-destroying blade, By him, whose sovereign word the rising tempest laid. Soon more than Rumour told the wond'rous tale, For now, to Eirin's King, an Envoy came, From the new convert in the sacred vale, Whose message stampt the vague report of Fame; Peace he propos'd, in royal Sitric's name, And amicable league to Eirin's Lord, With a fair pledge of peace, the northern Dane; Sweet Eleanor, by rival Kings ador'd, But for himself reserv'd the conquests of the sword. Then follows an account of the division and allotment of a portion of the conquered country to the Dane, and the preparations for the royal nuptials. Suspicion of treachery, on the side of the Dane, entertained by Negil, and his dispute in the Milesian Senate, with Colmar, on the subject. The commencement of the story of Theodolfe and Emma concludes the Specimen. Not all the darts of love are tip'd with lead; Not all to low pursuits the bosom fire; But oft with generous thoughts, the mind they feed, And fervent thirst of genuine fame inspire, Far from the Syren glance, ye youths retire, Which leads to shame; but when the heav'nly boy, Fanns, with his purple wings, the proud desire Of honest fame, the bold adventure try, And labour to obtain the plaudit of the sky! The one is common to the savage kind, The lion's fury, and the panther's flame, The other dignified by love of mind, A nobler origin is known to claim, When min'd, by lapse of time, the mundane frame, And all its perishable scenes decay, Thou still shalt live, immortal, and the same In the high noon of everlasting day, And all the blest above confess thy potent sway. A youth there was, of Gothmund's warlike train, Who, not by lucre led, nor thirst of blood, But love of glory, past the northern main, And foremost still in front of danger stood, The first to scale the wall, to pass the flood, To dare the ambush, or the camp explore; But when the royal Dane, by Heav'n subdu'd, Had seem'd to give the trade of slaughter o'er, His hours he pass'd in peace, on Senu's gentle shore. It chanc'd, as wand'ring at the close of light, Along the mazes of a solemn grove, When settling o'er the shade, approaching night, Her gentle glooms with easy finger wove, O'er ev'ry ally green, and gay alcove; He heard, afar, a lamentable strain, Of some benighted traveller, who strove To scape the hand of violence, in vain, And now with piercing cries the forest rang again. He hurried on, instructed by his ear, And soon the soul-affecting cause beheld, A young Milesian virgin, lovely, fair, With her attendant maids, by ruffians held, Of Scandian race, who prowl'd the nightly field, Like famish'd wolves, to seize their feeble prey, But soon the sword of Theodolfe, compell'd The lawless sons of spoil to haste away, Like the nocturnal crew, which shun the eye of day. She thank'd the gallant youth, with grateful tears, And at his warm request her lineage told; Her ancestors, in Eirins golden years, Ansoba's sons with gentle sway controll'd, Now in a neighb'ring vale, her parent old, The reliques of his ancient state possest, Since cruel Dania chang'd the times of gold, And claim'd the flow'ry borders of the west, To hapless Iverdon, a dire, unwelcome guest. The gallant Theodolfe the virgin led, To the near mansion of her aged sire; The sire, with hospitable rites, delay'd The saviour of his child, while young Desire Fann'd in the warriour's heart the latent fire. The father saw, and hail'd the growing flame; Fair Emma felt her gratitude inspire A correspondent glow, but maiden shame, And inborn dignity the infant wish o'ercame. But soon the sire, in pity to the pair, And won to yield, by Theodolfe's request, Prevents the wishes of the conscious fair, And tells the passion of his noble guest, The lover oft before his suit had prest; But still, with soft denial, to her sire The maid referr'd; but when the youth confest To the benignant man his warm desire, He soon his sanction gave, and blest the sacred fire. Their faith seem'd one, the pure baptismal rite, The noble convert with his King had shar'd; The maid consents, and soon his sacred light, With chearful haste, the nuptial god prepar'd. —Oh! let the holy rite be yet deferr'd, Unhappy sire! till The approaching festival appointed for the nuptials of the King of Ireland and Elianor. Tamor's Feast be o'er, While Sitric veils his fraud, with double guard: But soon, the genial board shall float in gore, And strife the signal sound to Eirin's furthest shore. —Why hangs the husband o'er yon fatal scroll, While streaming tears his infant joys profane? Why does he gaze in agony of soul, On the fair links of yonder golden chain, Giv'n by his lovely bride, but giv'n in vain? Alas! a stronger link of holy dread Fetters his mind.—But oh! illustrious Dane, Yet ere the moment of escape be fled, Preserve thy lovely spouse, and sire's devoted head! But now, with wild alarm, his lovely spouse Perceives the tempest of the hero's breast; How fast the tide of passion ebbs and flows, How oft by dark despondence lull'd to rest. With suppliant tears, the lovely mourner prest The secret of his swelling grief to know, And thus, at length, the conquer'd youth addrest His spouse, tho' oft the storm of bursting woe, And sorrow's bitter show'r forbad the cause to show. “Lost! lost, alas! beyond my power to save, I now must leave whate'er I hold most dear, Leave her, perhaps, to fill the gloomy grave, And I, unhappy I, am doom'd to bear A share in Eirin's woes!” alarm'd to hear His words, and his impassion'd looks to see; Again she pray'd her noble spouse to clear The secret of the deadly embassy, By every soothing art, and every tender plea. “Alas,” he cry'd, “the final blow is given, Which seals the doom of this devoted land; The signal of her fall is seen in heaven, And Odin triumphs o'er the bloody strand, The horrid business, long by Sitric plann'd, Is ripe at last, and labours to a close— Ev'n now, perhaps, he gives the stern command, From Tamor's hall to let destruction loose, Careless of obloquy and violated vows!” “Oh could my single hand avert our doom!— But cruel Honour, link'd with Fate, denies; How sweet, with you, in distant climes to roam, And spend our days beneath more gentle skies; But oh! the martial oath, the hallow'd ties That binds with more than adamantine force The warriours soul!—Oh Heav'ns! the flames arise, Yonder the sign of blood ascending soars, Haste! haste! your instant flight! and quit those deadly shores!” 'Twas night, the father, and the weeping fair, With a few trusty slaves, the hero led, Down to the shore, but watchful Hinguar, there, All round his cruel sentinels had spread, And soon they met the deadly ambuscade: Short was their strife, and threats and pray'rs, in vain, The youth employ'd: in vain, he oft display'd His faithful service to the royal Dane, The captive pair were led to join the sentenc'd train. Viz. The Christians who had been seized at a concerted time all over Ireland, by the Danes. Gothmund arriv'd; in vain the youth implor'd, The reverend father, and the fair, to free, Immortal hate inspir'd the haughty Lord, For Theodolfe's unshaken amity To Eugene well he knew, and spurn'd his plea. The hapless husband, struck with pale despair, Stood for a while, in speechless agony, Then sought (a slender boon) to see the fair, For her tremendous doom, his Emma to prepare. Gothmund agreed, but hell inspir'd the thought, To rend the bleeding heart with anguish new, Then to the gloomy jail, the youth was brought, Where Emma sate, retir'd from mortal view. The awful scene to come, had chang'd her hue, To saintly pale, yet still peculiar grace Liv'd in her look, and deeper homage drew, Than when the rose of health adorn'd her face, For somewhat seem'd her mind, above its lot to raise. Her hands were clasp'd, but not in guilty grief, Not, like a Magdalene, she rais'd her eye With penitential tears, to beg relief— Nor heav'd her bosom with one fearful sigh, But, like a winged virtue, sent from high, To this bad world, to walk the fated round, She seem'd to meditate the op'ning sky, As one on heaven's eternal voyage bound, By fiery instinct rais'd to spurn the sordid ground. But when he came, the angel left her look, And all the woman rush'd upon her soul; Her Heav'n-aspiring mind, awhile forsook Her fiery-winged friends above the pole, And mingled grief, and love connubial stole In tears away “and do the fates allow This boon,” she cry'd “before I reach the goal, To see the partner of my bliss below, Ere yet my parting soul the cares of life forego.” He clasp'd the weeping fair, and “yet,” he cry'd, “A moment is allow'd, a slender space, Yet, ere it fleet, thy lover's fate decide, If mutual love, or length of happy days, Or my eternal peace with Emma weighs; Renounce the cross! and quit the sentenc'd train, While Sitric, yet, the fatal word delays; Proud Gothmund then may storm, but storm in vain, To see his rescued prey contemn the broken chain. “Think what a triumph to the Dane is giv'n, What savage joy, to see his ancient hate Against thy husband, seal'd by angry Heaven, And his deep malice fed by Emma's fate. Oh Emma! think, before 'tis yet too late; Renounce the cross; and disappoint his wrath, Revere thy fire! revere thy mourning mate, Nor leave thy constant Theodolfe, beneath, To drag a hated life, nor dare to 'venge thy death.” He ceast, for sparkling indignation warm, Lived in her look, and light'ned in her eye, A heav'nly glow inhancing every charm; “And is it thus you break the dearer tye, That bound us with the sanction of the sky: O bitterness of death! exalted pain! I thought, when fortune dash'd my cup of joy, This single consolation might remain, To find us link'd above, in pure Emmanuel's reign. “Immortal guardians, thro' the dreadful test Sustain my virtue, and my faith uphold; For what is virtue, when the tranquil breast Nor tryal knows, to purge the genuine gold From earthly dross.—O negligent and cold, To pure enjoyment, and the charms of mind; I thought thy manly spirit, uncontroll'd, Had left the accidents of life behind, And each sublunar chance, to mortal man assign'd!” “And what is life, my Theodolfe,” she cry'd, “Without the heart-felt joy, the heavenly glow, Of self-acquittance, rais'd by virtuous pride, O'er every transitory chance below? Shall I survive, the final overthrow Of conscience, reason, and eternal truth, To feel the viewless sting of endless woe, Above the pow'r of ought on earth to soothe; Ah! lure me not to shame! mistaken, generous youth, &amp;c.” End of the Specimen. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF CHARLEMONT, &amp;c. These verses were by accident misplaced, which I hope will be accepted as an apology, by the noble personage to whom they are addressed, for their appearance in this part of the volume. O thou! in letter'd ease retir'd, Whose noon of life, the patriots fir'd; When Eirin's free-born sons thy call obey'd: What sister of the sacred nine, (For all the virgin choir is thine,) Hallows thy musings in Marino's shade? I see thee sit, with tranquil eye, The fair plantation's The Royal Irish Academy. growth to spy; Foster'd by thee, on Eirin's favour'd strand, The nurslings of thine Attic Bower, By vernal sun and genial shower, Rais'd to an hopeful height, their boughs expand. Or, dost thou turn the Grecian page, To mark, how Democratic Rage, On other shores its fiery track pursu'd; Till, cautious, from its wild career, Assembled nations, struck with fear, Remov'd its fuel, and the pest subdued. Not such thy mild and temper'd ray, That chac'd the settled gloom away, When Freedom op'd her eyes on new-born light; When by the kindling dawn reveal'd, His peaceful bands emblaz'd the field, Publish'd the high resolve, and claim'd their right. Full many a meteor's wand'ring light, Has burn'd along the waste of night, By vapours kindled, and in vapours lost; Flashing in ceruscations wild, Since first your beam, with influence mild, Rose like a star benign, and bless'd our coast. Long exil'd from his native shore, You brought the Freedom. sleeping pilgrim o'er, And watch'd his slumbers with parental care. Your art the magic medium clear'd, Thro' which his native land appear'd A somb'rous scene, a prospect of despair!

For years, in Wisdom's shrine conceal'd, Your pious care the stranger held, (So Judah's See the Athaliah of Racine, and 2 Kings, c. 11. patriot hid the royal boy,) Till, to the plausive bands around, You call'd him from his shrine profound, Like a descending native of the sky. Thy daring friend Mr. Grattan. the flag unfurl'd, High streaming o'er a wond'ring world; He spoke; and millions caught the sacred flame; Thus Aaron, by his brother call'd To Israel's legions long enthrall'd, With heaven-taught eloquence divulg'd their claim: O may'st thou keep the public mind Like thine, to legal claims confin'd, Like that prime orb, Alluding to the solar influence on the tides. that rules the murm'ring tide, And checks the sister planets sway, Which else would give the deluge way, O'er the pale shores indevastation wide! And may the band The Royal Irish Academy. that boasts thy name, Press onward in the paths of fame, And still new worlds of science own their power.

May every social joy combine, (For every social charm is thine,) To chear thy leisure in Marino's shade! N. B. An earlier place in the Volume, was designed for the foregoing lines; but, owing to an accident, it happened to be misplaced. TO THE RIGHT REVEREND THOMAS PERCY, LORD BISHOP OF DROMORE, ON HIS RETURN TO IRELAND, ANNO. 1793. Welcome! thrice welcome to those shores, again Escap'd the perils of th'autumnal main! O'er many a mournful trophy, won and lost, Four times the burning line Hyperion crost, His Lordship had been two years absent from Ireland. And, wheeling round from either tropic, view'd Waste realms, and flaming towns, and fields of blood. While to his eye, our planet's face afar Display the sanguine, stern, eclipse of war, Whence Blasphemy, with deep, volcanic rage, Seem'd war with heaven, and man, at once to wage; Since Taste and Genius wept the western gale That wing'd, for other shores, thy parting sail. Not long they mourn'd; for, tho' you seem'd to part, Your country's purest love, that warm'd your heart, Still led you, Pliny the elder. like Verona's sage, to find What fatal cause had fir'd the general mind, What chance had given the flaming chaos way, Whose loud, eruptive storm obscur'd the day. Undaunted round the verge you seem'd to go, And mark the fiery flood that rav'd below, Then, with deep thought, explor'd the mighty charm Of sovereign power to lay the coming storm.— From the calm regions of eternal rest, Ev'n from the splendid mansions of the blest, You call'd the mighty spirit to your aid, His Lordship is engaged in a republication of the works of the celebrated Dr. Jeremy Taylor, some time Lord Bishop of Down and Connor; a design eminently adapted to promote the true evangelical spirit of pure philanthropy, Christian moderation, and subjection to legal authority. Who here, in mortal form, the Crozier sway'd. On thee the mit'red saint, benignant, smiles, And aids, with viewless hand, thy noble toils. O may'st thou, like the warm approach of spring, That Promethæan charm, to Eirin bring, Which dull, cold hearts will own, with filial awe, And learn to beat for Loyalty and Law!— By thee recall'd, our buried bards arise, Reliques of Ancient Poetry, published by his Lordship. Visions of ancient glory meet our eyes; The lyre resounds, to former ages dear, And long-forgotten warblings charm the ear. Amid the laurel'd pomp we see thee stand, The trembling chords obey thy skilful hand; The Phrygian harp renews its sweetest strain, And Bertram's sorrows wound the list'ning train. Hermit of Warkworth. In ancient times the muses worth was priz'd, Her aid the social virtues recognized; Nor are her charms decay'd, while Percy's name Supports her state, and dignifies her claim. The muse will earn her wreath, for she can quell The demagogue, and mar the sophist's spell: The descant bold of Thracia's lyre alone, Baffled the Syrens with commanding tone; When their smooth measures lull'd the slumb'ring main, And warriors melted at the magic strain. ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ?? ???????? ???????? ?? ?? ?? ???????? ???? ???????? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????, ?????????? ?????? ???????? ???????.

But nobler arts are thine, sublimer toils, His Lordship's Key to the New Testament, a book that contains more important information in a small compass, and thence more adapted to general use, than, probably, any mere human composition. When Zion crowns thy cares with other spoils; When Sorrow dries her tears, Despondence flies, As thou unfold'st the counsels of the skies: When touched by thee, her holy valves unclose, And far within, the sacred splendor glows, While, thro' the mazy walk, thy powerful hand, Conducts thy pupil to the central stand. Whence his clear ken, by heavenly art refin'd, Takes in the mighty scheme that fills the mind; While at each glance, Imagination burns, And as he views, the man to angel turns. O may the sacred influence spread around, Till wild licentious rage, with awe profound, Submits, obsequious, to its wide controll, And claim the nobler freedom of the soul! The leader thus of Israel's holy choir, (When bloody Saul, with persecuting Ire Th'anointed youth of Heaven's own choice pursued, Resolv'd to stain the sacred court with blood,) Struck the sweet lyre, and rais'd the potent lay, The demons heard the hymn, with pale dismay, And from their ancient home with fury chac'd, Forsook their mansion in the maniac's breast.</field>
