      <field name="fulltext">POEMS TO MY FATHER. See, Father, here are flowers! They're all thine own; Gather'd for thee, and tied, by love and duty; Let them be dear, if but for that alone, Pleasant for the intent, if not the beauty. No man should dare despise a single one, Since given to a father by a son. I had not ask'd thy hand to find them room If worthless I had deem'd them: but if each Were but a weed, and if, while roses bloom, No daisy should dare live,âas some men preach,â Yet, surely, if the least delight or pride Aught here gave thee, I should be justified. October 30, 1848. EUGENE. It sings of Nature's thrills, her sounds and sights, A lonely boy, and some of his delights. The light that parleys with a poet's eyes Hath more rays than the mere prismatic seven, For goes therewith a flush of such fine dyes As makes of earth meet vestibule for heaven, Blends with all dullest things a lifeful leaven, And quickens to a full sweet Sunday grace The dead looks in this world's old workday face. When Eugene's eyes in infant wonderment First questioned this mysterious world, for him In vain spake tongueful Nature; vainly spent The Earth her beautiful continual hymn; Why did he look with such perception dim? Why dreamt he not of that poetic soul Majestical that vivifies the whole? Yet sometimes came wild startlings, and his eyes Widened and burned, as reading wondrous lore, But then at once the exquisite surprise Would die down into dulness as before; For the Muse knew he might not yet bear more, So let flit dimly past his soul forlorn Joys bodiless that must not yet be born. At length, the gates of vision came unchained; New light flowed outward through his wondering eyes, Whose eagerness continually gained Unguessed-of news from earth and air and skies; And many till then obstinate mysteries He as acquaintance boldly could accost, Their cold reserve and distance being lost. Now for his heart athirst new solace ran, Poured from the only source that satisfies; For Nature's old dull crust all o'er began To crack and peel, and through the clefts his eyes Caught glimpses of the Deity that lies Creative under all. Whate'er he saw Was quick with new thought, wonder, worship, awe. All musical he grew, all musical, For melody would start about his heart, And oft sound with so audible a call, And be so real, so from himself apart, It seemed an echo from God's throne did start,â That some sad sinner had been just forgiven, And the glad angels rang the bells of heaven. Now what Prometheus meant might Eugene see, For this creative creature 'gan to give Heaven's living fire so wide and lavishly That all inanimate things appear'd to live: To fields and flowers the boy grew talkative; Accosted stars and stones; enjoy'd the meeting With trees, which held their arms out for his greeting. So he was never alone; for,âlying,âfloat Would music round his pillow; walking,âair Grow busy with low voices; on the river,â The water seem all pulsed by footsteps fair With little whirling dimples here and there; Or,âturning round,âbe glimpsed swift vanishings Of robes ethereal and mysterious wings. All things were changed:âthe little gentle flowers Were brothers, now, and sisters to Eugene; The birds were feather-veilÃ«d guardian powers Tenanting leafy thrones, with loving mien, To watch earth's good, and sing sweet songs between; The dew that when the stars burn bright is given, Was precious oil dropp'd from those lamps of heaven. Earth was a glorious great kaleidoscope Which, turning ever, fed his eye anew: He lived in one wide palace of fine hope, With floor of green, and archÃ«d roof of blue, And he a son of its great Maker too,â A son made grandly welcome to each part, And with a son's right to be glad in heart. All things had influence for him; all his heart Was as a harp of such responsive strings, That not an evening primrose could out-start, No lark shake rapture from its fluttering wings, Not the least motion rise in natural things, But all its chords would tremble and compete In rich vibration, eloquently sweet. Thus Nature, as with delicate-fingered wind, Played soft Ãolian music in his breast, And wooed him ever with her courtship kind Till she had won him to a sweet unrest, And made his heart all eager with a zest For converse with her in the loneliest bowers, Loving her to her face for hours and hours. Now he delighted, stretched on bed of grass, To learn the looks of the sun-lighted skies; Cloud-watching, till his lifted soul would pass To God's great heaven of thought-wove tapestries; There lie at catch for inward symphonies, For sweetness and for fulness far above All sounds of earth that men's ears drink and love. Yet also glad was he for cloven shout Of cuckoo, and for all the voiceful throng That wreathe their voluntaries in and out, Felicitous, the leafy boughs among;â Glad even of the gnats' drowsed undersong; And he liked, too, the sound of merriment By distant steeple's loud-tongued tenants sent; Who, tossing up their heads imperious, find Tasks and long errands for the busy gales, Measuring out bellfuls of melodious wind Impregnated and spiced with chiming tales Which ought the winds to bear into far vales, But, careless, lose part of their message sweet, So bring a burden richly incomplete:â And glad was he, to list when all around Harsh winter blasts throng in, the world to freeze, Each to keen edge and cutting sharpness ground On icy pavements of the northern seas, And hear them fighting with the uprooted trees, Beating the boughs on their bleak threshing floors, Whooping out triumph o'er far howling moors:â Or watch when March sends out his windy elves To shake by th' shoulders the deep slumbering trees, To bid them wake and dress their drowsy selves In haste the approaching Lady Spring to please; Nor may those tiresome breezes cease to tease, Until each giant, answering their appeals, In a green mantle its gaunt arms conceals:â Or see some tree shake its sad aged head, Priming the wind with storm-foreboding sighs, While each leaf writheth on its stalky thread, And, shuddering, whispereth rainy prophecies, Because the black clouds, weary of the skies, Spent with far travel, sullen stand, and roar, And, till unladen, vow they'll move no more:â Or watch the dozing twilight drop asleep Just when the setting sun gives Eve's first star Her cue upon that boundless stage to leap, Whereto ten thousand mighty orbs afar The theatre and watchful audience are;â Why fears it not to play its little part? Why shines it on with an unflurried heart? Gently it twinkleth there its prologue out Till that fair stage grows brighter by a moon, And the quick stars scatter themselves about, Peopling all skiey nooks and by-ways soon, That no place lack its little glimmering boon; And prouder grow the rich and populous skies Twinkling all over with a thousand eyes. But oh, how healing to all aching pang, On profiled moon's bright crescent thin to gaze, And on her fine sharp horns intense to hang A thousand phantasies a thousand ways! Or, when her face grows to a fuller phase, How sweet to calm our passion's seething lees In her pure beams of cooling, soothing ease! Yet are there times when cruel witchcraft fills Her light, no longer friendly; when a flood Of chill lone feeling passionates and thrills Our hearts, and kills our calmness in the bud; When hints to grief, half-vaguely understood, By her are lent, till our unbidden eyes Our cheeks with mournful overflow surprise. For then come visions of the old home-places, Dear, consecrated, incense-haunted fanes; And then rise memories of lost forms and faces, Rise, like old vials' odours sweet, and strains Of songs that sob to music that complains; While airs leap on us from forgotten climes Rich with the holy breath of better times. Ay, we may weep, and weep! They will not come,â The soft warm hand; the voluble dear eye; Lips whereon, open, sweet speech; whereon, dumb, The honey-gift, for us did ever lie: They will not come, though we for grief should die. Eugene was not too young for memory's tongue To pierce his soul;âwho is there that's too young? But, when the stars dim out, and darkling lies Earth under moonless heaven, then would Eugene The thickening night confront, and let his eyes On the blind blackness grapple with stern mien, While groan'd the trees in dusky turmoil keen, As if the horrible winds their stretch did swell To span some dread Ãolian harp of hell. O Night, thou speaker in all awful tones Of bale and unredeemable despair! Why hang'st thou on thy winds such creaks and moans As might almost persuade us that we hear Old earth's huge axle grind? Why should thy fear Make dread torpedo-thoughts swim in by shoals, Smiting to dumbness our astounded souls? Yet in the excitements of the night not oft Did Eugene revel thus; fields and the day Had better pleasures for him;âas, when soft The morning blows o'er flowers, then away With the white river to keep holiday;â To brighten in broad sunshine; or to run Where flickering shadows half deny the sun;â Or hear the birds, orchestred deep in leaves, Transmute, with power alchemic, to sweet strain, Air lately mute, while the young sun-dawn weaves Fine gold into the clouds, and earth amain Like sun-woke Memnon's statue o'er again, Greets its first beams, and, to proclaim its rise, All her sweet, living, feathery psalteries plies. And Eugene liked some glorious book to bring Beneath the trees, and read, on some hill-side, Of Isabella's piteous gardening, Or Porphyro's thief-venture for a bride; Or how old Apollonius, cruel-eyed, Shoots arrows from bent eyebrow bows, to slay Lycius and Lamia on their wedding-day:â Or any other essence of man's heart Distill'd by poets to eternal times; But ever loathingly the boy would start From tales, unantidoted poison-rhymes, Of souls all fungus'd over with their crimes,â Too busy with sharp-rowel'd passions' goading To take or heed forbidding or foreboding. And often to the boy an impulse came Urging his soul to try her strength in songs; For what was in him but a fiery flame? And what were round him but symphonious throngs Of words that seem'd to fall from heavenly tongues? And what was left him, but to vent that flame, And utter those sweet sayings as they came? Ay, though sage list'ners mock'd his harp's young tones, And bade him cease from the ambitious trade, Why should he cease? Fire shut up in the bones Consumes to baneful ash its barricade. Why should he cease? For the whole world was made, Glorious with foregleams of what might be done In noble work,âay, and what honour won. 'Tis true, indeed, the thought of wealth or fame Belongs not rightly to the poet's pleasures; He must not damp that pure high-aiming flame For popular praise, nor play those heaven-born measures On strings tuned low to th' chink of earthly treasures; He must not dream God's great trusts may be sold; He must not dare to cramp his soul in gold. Yet while he works for duty's sake in chief, Not too much loving voices that applaud, The poet should not be without belief That in the boundaries of our language broad There will be one or two kind souls unawed By others' censure, who will find in him, If dimness, yet at least some gold not dim. Thus is he not so lower'd below or raised Above his kind, as to be all unmoved And careless of the sweet of being praised; Thinks it a bliss to have his rhymes approved By noble souls, of Goodness well-beloved;â Hopes to be read at least by one or two Such as I know, and such as Eugene knew. And oft he pictures some heart, precious cruse Of holy human feeling, that shall read His leaves, and not, because of dross, quite lose His genuine gold; that shall her glances feed On rhymes that cannot ask a better meed; And some kind smiles upon the book bestow Of him who writes for her he ne'er will know. And oft he pictures some large-hearted youth Shall love the unknown rhymer, for the sake Of the known rhymes; one not gnaw'd by the tooth Of worldliness; not seized of Mammon-ache; To Friendship, Beauty, Goodness, all awake:â For such he hopes to work; with such to stand A friend unseen, yet shaken by the hand. LOSS. âI faint, I die,â cried the apple-tree, âAll my dear fruit is gone from me.â Cheer up, mistaken one! There be Fifty more good crops in thee. THE SKY AT NIGHT. Great House of spaces, rolling orbs and years! Rebuking this world's self-important hum With the vast, awful silence of thy spheres, Thou with enormous thought-stretch mak'st us dumb. Yet if in thee I, simply like a child, The floor of heaven, and the wide roof, may see, Of this dear endless earth of our delight, I shall be reconciled To let my song live happy, loud, and free, A bold sedge-warbler 'neath the Sky at night. With thee it is, and with thy stars, that now, O child-entrancing Sky, I have to do; Thou art the highway of the Moon, and thou Shalt be the highway of my spirit too. Clouds climb, and cannot touch thee; winds blow high And cannot reach thee; but my thought shall reach, And ride, as all thy starry navies ride, On thy broad breast, O Sky! With every floating brilliance there hold speech, And sail far off on thy slow western tide. Stars! Gems scintillant, in most ancient wells Of cold, keen lustre dyed unto the core:â Stars! Rosaries whereon old Time still tells His years and ages as he says them o'er:â Stars! Signal-lights which for her fast ally, The giant Night, to bid him hasten on His reinforcements, Twilight high upholds:â Stars! Night-flowers of the sky, Waking at glow-worm time, and one by one All noiseless starting full-blown from your folds:â Great glorious company of throbbing flames! Joyful dismissers of the dismal dark! How could men foist on you their savage names, And your vague groups with lying lines demark? How could they cage you up, a wild-beast show Of Lion, Scorpion, Centaur, Dragon, Bear, Awed by Orion's club-uplifting boast? The child's heart will not know Such fancies grim; it loves your aspects fair, And re-installs your undivided host. With what slow pace, and with what silent shoon, And with what pale looks tenderly astray, Comes up the Lady of the Sky, the Moon, Sunk in deep thought as of some bygone day! Through her sky-field insensibly she glides Among her star-flowers blooming in the night, Of all their crowd unconscious, till the hour When, as young Morn uprides, The Sun ascending with his scythe of light Shall mow down, masterful, each shining flower. But oh, thou dark-blue Sky-mead! Would that I Might stand upon thee,âmight look down and see How daisies stars are, in our meadowy sky, As stars seem brighter daisies upon thee. Life is on all sides beautiful; it sees Its courts between two all-wide beauties set,â Roof'd with blue beauty, with green beauty paved:â We need our miseries! Else would our souls their higher aim forget, And be to Nature's fairness all enslaved. And oh, thou dark Cloak, God's own vestment wide,â Blue sprinkled o'er with twinkling drops of gold,â Would that some wind might blow thee once aside To give us glimpse of glories thou dost hold! Yet Whom thou coverest thou canst not hide; Through thy all-marvellous texture showers a rain Of splendours such as in the old time gave Thee to be deified:â How can we wonder that the ancient brain Should deem thy stars gods strong to slay or save? For so they sit, each night, calm on the sky, Reading what day hath writ on earth's wide page, That hardly keep from adoration I, Born to the usage of a Christian age. But I am taught, and may not bend the knee, And may not give clasp'd worship of the hands; Yet must the stars the sacred symbols seem Of truth divine to me,â Truth that for ever high above us stands To wake our souls from earth's engrossing dream. Great floor of heaven, with star-seed oversown,â Floor by the hand Divine for ever laid,â What feet are on thee! feet all spotless grown, And kiss'd with robes whose pureness casts no shade, Fluttering for ever in the wind of praise,â Feet of the sinless, from whose large eyes looks Wide wonder blent with joy's peculiar flame,â Wide wonder at God's ways,â Sinless, whose foreheads He hath ta'en for books Whereon to write the splendours of His name. Stars, bright inheritors of heaven! O tell Some little abstract of what ye have known, In God's metropolis wherein ye dwell, O'er-flooded by the glories of the throne! Jewels, set in the floor of heaven, and trod Of blest feet, tell us of the joy they know Whose praises, humbly daring, upward spring To kiss the feet of God,â Bright angels, each conveying to or fro Some vouchsafed message, on proud-swelling wing! They will not speak, these stars, to fleshly ear;â Of angels and of heavenly temple, dumb, And of the Lord of angels, they appear; Yet to the spirit's ear their anthems come. Shine o'er us, then, your message bright to bring, Great hieroglyphs of God, for ever shine; And while ye all, like vocal tongues of flame, In sensuous silence, sing, Lift high our thoughts to the great House divine, And thrill with worship of th' Eternal Name! PYRRHO. Pyrrho doubts in all things shows With an ingenious skill; Says, even, 'tis false the river flows, Or that its banks stand still. Trent was in this very place Under CÃ¦sar's power, And its banks move on through space Some thousand miles an hour. UNDER THE ALDER-TREE. It was a sad soul sitting Beneath an Alder-tree; From death's insensate fiction He was not yet set free; Not spirit's life but body's death Was all that he could see, And so he sat, and thus he cried, Beneath the Alder-tree. Chain of life, me binding down To the rock of misery, With the sorrow-vulture eating At the heart, I weary o' thee, For She cannot come again, Cannot come ever to me. Joy,âall joy,âall joy is o'er,â Joy of speech or silent eyes,â Mine, ah mine no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me, For the wind waileth where she lies Under the Alder-tree. Face, where, while we gaze on 't, feeling, Penetrate with purity, Springs from soul-roots, through the feature Upward branching like a tree,â Oh, Her looks! They were like skies Raining blessing ever on me! Ever on me? Wo 's me, 'tis o'er; Lost, ah, lost the love of her eyes, They shall smile no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me, For the leaf withereth where she lies Under the Alder-tree. Then a step so softly stately, So divinely womanly, That than angel's own it seemeth Not by one sin's weight less free,â Oh, Her step! And it always came Springing lighter, springing to me! To me? Wo 's me, 'tis o'er, 'tis o'er; She never, never to meet me flies; She will come no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me; Green grass is growing where she lies Under the Alder-tree. Then a mouth, whereto is given Voice to be the clue and key To old dreams that rocked the poet On the cradle of their knee:â Oh, Her voice! 'Twas like high heaven Saying kind things ever to me! Ever to me? Wo 's me, 'tis o'er; I call, and call; she never replies; Speak she will no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me, For the owl hoots where she lies Under the Alder-tree. Then a sudden, sweet emotion Of so absolute purity That for once we understand How sacred mortal flesh can be:â Oh, Her touch! Oh, soft her hand, Soft, warm, kind, ever to me! Ever to me? Wo 's me, 'tis o'er, And a voice within me cries She shall press my hand no more To heal the heart all broken in me, For nettles thrive where my Love lies Under the Alder-tree. Then a touch at whose intenseness,â Like an electricity Sheathed in down,âflesh, soul, change places Till we know not which we be;â Kiss, like pressure of angel's wing Warm of heaven's glory, ever to me! Ever to me? Wo 's me, 'tis o'er; She shall hallow my cheeks, mine eyes, With her lips no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me, For the worm gnaws where my Love lies Under the Alder-tree. Evermore the sorrow-vulture Eateth at the spirit's core. Fate and death away have taken What they never may restore; For She will not come again,â Come again, for evermore! Bliss,âall bliss,âall bliss is o'er, Naught but death's dismay and sighs, For She's mine no more, no more, To heal the heart all broken in me, For cold stones cover her where she lies Under the Alder-tree. THE DAISY. A gold and silver cup Upon a pillar green, Earth holds her Daisy up To catch the sunshine in;â A dial-plant, set there To show each radiant hour;â A field-astronomer, A sun-observing flower;â A little rounded croft Where wingÃ«d kine may graze;â A golden meadow soft, Quadrille-ground for young fays;â A fenced-in yellow plot With pales milk-white and clean, Each tipt with crimson spot And set in ground of green. The children with delight To meet the Daisy run; They love to see how bright She shines upon the sun. Like lowly white-crown'd queen She graciously doth bend, And stands with quiet mien The little children's friend. Sometimes the Daisy's seen, A simple rustic maid, In comely gown of green, And pure white frill array'd, Dreaming, like one in mood Of hope by fancy spun, Awaiting to be wooed, And willing to be won. The dandy Butterfly, All exquisitely dress'd, Before the Daisy's eye Displays his velvet vest; In vain is he array'd In all that gaudy show; What need hath rustic maid Of such a foppish beau? The vagrant Bee but sings For what he gets thereby, Nor comes, except he brings His pocket on his thigh; Then let him start aside And woo some wealthier flower; The Daisy's not his bride, She hath no honey-dower. The Gnat, old back-bent fellow, In frugal frieze-coat drest, Seeks on her carpet yellow His tottering limbs to rest; He woos her with eyes dim, Voice thin, and aspect sage;â What careth she for him? What mate is youth for age? Upon her head she lifts, Where they can best be seen, Her little golden gifts In white-fringed basket green: Still ready to be met In every passing hour, The little children's pet, Their ever-faithful flower. SOLITUDE. Sweet solitude!âThe Frenchman's happy play Of wit I here with graver thought implete:â Yes, sweet is Solitude, if but we may The Lord take with us, unto Whom to say That Solitude is sweet. But He'll not only smile and answer âYeaâ;â Ere long He'll lead us to a place of ships, And He will make us go aboard that day, To send us from dear Solitude away, Even though it be with whips. Why be grieved that I your converse Now and then refuse? Or to say nought for a awhile In your presence choose? Pleasant are your voices, Dearest ones, to me, More pleasant, yea, than Sabbath-bells At holy evening be: But nearer still my yearning soul Would have your voices dear; Be silent, therefore, that your thoughts I may the better hear. I love to gaze upon your face, The meaning there to read, Dear One, in whose heart's embrace Is privilege indeed; But why be so sad-hearted, Why feel mortified, If I leave you now and then In lonely place to hide? From hill and vale they call me, From star, and moss, and stone; I cannot list those voices wise Unless I be alone. When long I keep away therefrom, The life within me dies; With them conversing, soon upsprings New vigour to mine eyes. Again my step is firm; again I breathe a manly breath: Marvel not then I go to hear What each still Speaker saith. Not even your presence, Sweet, shall win my soul To be in love with death. WILL AND WAY. You complain: âOutward snares are too strong; Meaning right, I am forced to do wrong:ââ Nonsense, man! Sin's vile course you must stay, For where'er there 's a will there 's a way. Say no more you can not, for you can! Up, this fight must be fought! Play the man What we ought to achieve, that we may, And where'er there 's a will there 's a way. Never flinch; never dare turn aside; Hard will prove not so hard when you 've tried; Practice makes hardest work easy play, And where'er there 's a will there 's a way. Not in strength of our own can we win; Ask of God! He will fight with your sin: Help'd by Him, then indeed shall you say, âNow I know, where 's the will, there 's the way.â THE STAR. First Star of evening, show thy face, For the world waits for thee;â The swallow to the owl gives place, And to the bat the bee;â Gleam out, thou radiance intense! Thrust quick this growing darkness hence That, thickening, gives my yearning eyes Such unabash'd offence. Lift thy dark eyelid, gentle Star, And let me see thine eye! High thoughts, from self and sin afar, We oft allow to die; But hearts, though earthy in th' extreme, Dreams of a nobler life might dream, Shone but the visible melody Of thy converting beam. Eyes are souls' tongues; then let me hear The soul that speaks through thee; Thou hast a speech of accent clear, A solemn speech, for me: And, were my spirit wild with hell, The messages thy rays can tell Should strike me calm,âlike the clear toll Of a religious bell. It gleams! It gleams! The starry sprite Its eyelids deigns to part; Swift shoots a wiry lance of light, Straight tilting at my heart; It seems a friend to recognise, Darts through the wide door of the eyes, Falls on the soul's neck with a kiss Of lovingest surprise! Do stars weep? Sure, to that star-twink Some tear-fraught mist was given!â How delicately doth it shrink Back-lessening into heaven! It seems about to quite depart;â Ah! it leaps forward with a start, Like the convulsed and desperate beat Of a most suffering heart. And it may weep;âa star may weep, Ay, spite of natural bars; For hath not earth woes deadly deep Should e'en force tears from stars? It must be all creation's part To fellow-feel with human smart, While pity throbs in every beat Of God's all-loving heart. Yes; stars may weep, God pity, yet Men no compassion show, And can most thoughtlessly forget A brother's piteous throe; Are we not all too slow to heed The bleeding of the hearts that bleed, Too slow to feel each others' want, And heal each others' woe? We fret our lives, we waste our souls, For weary wealth or fame, Yet die at last inglorious moles Blind digging to our shame:â For there 's no glory, save to try To wipe tears from another's eye, And help his spirit to transcend Each merely earthly aim. MOUNT PERILOUS OF PRIDE. He sets truths in his fire to cook Till they to falsehoods swell, And some go pop with a spurious look, And some with a curious smell. Bring them to Book! Bring them to Book! When once they burst the shell, Easily twists the tongue acrook That would true verdict tell. His fire sends smoke the skies to kiss, And all the skies rebel, Lest shrink their countless homes of bliss To a solitary cell. Seest thou really naught amiss? And stands his Mountain well? Its edge is the brink of a precipice Down falling sheer to hell! Above the hills Lit with the sun's bright flame; Over the rills Always and never the same; Old as the old primeval heaven, There is a home to him who finds it given, Above the hills' sides, torrent-riven, Above the valleys' shame. Below, the winds lie crouch'd in their caves, Like tigers ready for leaping; The clouds look down on the mournful earth And cannot stay from weeping; The lightnings quiver, in bright wreaths curl'd, Like fiery snakes half-sleeping; But nothing of these wots that high world, Blest quiet ever keeping. Leave wife or child, leave wealth or fame, But leave that region not; So shall be all of shameful shame, And trick of fate, forgot. From thy soul, of thy sun's flame, By valley-lust, no least ray be exiled; That shall be thy wealth and fame Shall be thy wife and child. Though mine arm I made a girdle About a maiden's waist; Though for my mouth mine eyes their utmost wit Of eloquence had often tried, that it Her innocent kiss might taste; Though look on look had, flowing, fix'd, Souls utterly intermix'd, Hearts' fibres interlaced, And she said, if I forsook, Life would forsake, And well I knew that if I went Her gentle heart would break; Yet if she led me to the vale, From my sun-track kept me, That that high land might accept me, I must let her face grow pale, And leave her there, Nor could repent, although around Her comely head the shroud it drew, and bound Dark cypress in her hair. I have sworn an oath, and I will keep it, As Allah doth me save, Nor, by His help, once will I overleap it Until I keep my grave; Sworn that no pretext shall my soul seduce To shear its brow of one fair lock of sun, Nor will I down into those valleys run By strong persuasion to false duty or use, Of hundreds, or of one. Yes, Messieurs, right well I hear you,â Hear all your screamers say:â âThe wealthy man rides through the people's blood Their bodies pave his way. Will you not stimulate a sinking nation To lift its voice aloud For the swift riddance of that usurpation Of few over the crowd?â What! shall I praise the just and equal boat Where crew, not captain, rules? Or risk the State on hazard of the vote Of all its common fools? I will not tell that barefaced lie again, That all are fashioned equal, Nor say their politics to these blind men Will bring the wish'd-for sequel. I am no Radical, Nor am I Whig or Tory; I am a lover of the Mount, And of its wisdom hoary. But why not join the wiser few who find âA hungry peopleâ ever âcreeping nigher,â Like âlionâ glaring in its bestial ire âAt one that nods and winks behind A slowly-dying fireâ? In truth, methinks I see a grand new day About to pour through the sun's burning lens; And day, when it arrives, must fright away All night-beasts to their dens. Already is it dawning; and this day Has virtues to all previous days unknown, For even now the lion slinks away To a new den of his own; That den already larger, cleaner grows; To a fresh type it fast approximates, With maps upon the walls, and desks in rows, And forms, and books, and slates. So why not trust the lion? Sharp the claws, And fierce the teeth have been, and rough the hide; Trust him, and see how soon kind Nature's laws Improvements will provide; Make the fangs soften and fall, And new milk-teeth install; Make claws grow thin and small, And for knife and scissors call; Make the rough hair be cast, And leave clean skin at last; Make the frame change its plan, The brain enlarge and strengthen, The heart grow soft and mild, The lower members lengthen, And the beast stand up a mighty man And harmless as a child. Dreams, say you? Well, 'tis Allah's own affair Democracy's His stream. We have to swim, Or float, in what He sends us everywhere; Let us be glad that, after all, the care And onus are on Him. I am no Radical, Nor am I Whig or Tory; I am a lover of the Mount, And of its wisdom hoary. Good sisters, urge me not. I see the tears Those little children shed; The bitter cry sounds sadly in mine ears From many a lingering bed; Heavenward I see the hungry turn their faces, And still they are not fed; And mothers with yet ignorant embraces Embrace their children dead. Believe me, you than I are not more eager To help mankind and save:â Go ye, rescue those forms, so shrunk and meagre, From the wide-wasting grave: But neither do I waste a life in dreaming Because I seem not to be helping you; I can be doing far, far more, while seeming Far less, or naught, to do. For on my Mountain one short hour Plucking a fruit, culling a flower, Must ever in the end More blessing lend Mankind, Than long years spent below, Wiping the tears that flow, Loosing the chains that bind. I have sworn an oath, and I will keep it, As Allah doth me save, Nor, by His help, once will I overleap it Until I keep my grave; Sworn that no cold derisive smiling Of foe, nor prayer of friend, Nor loss of fame and honour, nor reviling, Shall ever me my soul make lend To what would cramp its wider aim, Or maim Its universal end. High o'er the hills I'd live; out from my heart I cannot bear to thrust one beam divine; Choose you, then, for yourselves, your lot and part, And I have chosen mine. YOUNG LOVE. What's softer than a baby-wind new-born Trying to kiss a whisper from a tree? More constant to man's heart than sound o' th' sea To the curl'd inlet of a sea-shell's horn? What 's quieter than death of flower forlorn, Uprooted where the pitiless sun can see? Or facile weddings of the fragrant pea That puts a ring on every fingery thorn? What's gentler than a young rill's murmurings So softly singing through its meadow-ways? Or silenter than sun's unsparing gaze The maiden blood in cherries' cheeks that brings?â O 'tis young Love; for he a nest can raise In hearts that never guess his busy wings. âA LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM.â No, Preacher, no! Cease further to entreat. I will not go Those thorns, those flints to meet; They prick, they bruise my knees, They wound my feet. Let me alone! That cruel, rough-hewn smart, That solid groan, Christ's Cross, makes me to start; It tears my arms, my breast, Pierces my heart. Some men are so That from them goodness flows Easy as glow From star, or scent from rose; But I, alas, am not At all like those. Still am I young. What! must my youth go waste? To taste shall tongue Be made, and yet not taste? Arms to embrace, yet joys Be unembraced? With looks that please, Allurement yonder stands; And what are these That hold me?âWoven sands To be despised by eyes, Brush'd off by hands! Thus heart rebell'd One day, and claim'd wild range. But I beheld A little child. How strange Sin's sudden death! That sight Wrought all the change. LIFE, NOT DEATH. A wailing voice of prophecy, A voice of anguish in our ears! Why will ye tell us so, our fears, That she must die? So fair she seems, In wealth of womanhood so high, How can it enter in our dreams That our dear friend can die? Yet enters there the prophecy; It more than enters there,âit dwells! That voice hath never ceased that tells That she must die. Let us not feign, Let us not feign our eyes are dry; They weep an agonisÃ«d rain Because our friend will die. Shall we not weep? Shall we not sigh? Shall we not rather storm and curse And rave against this Universe That lets her die? Nay, nay, be still, Let us be still! Not you nor I Should rave. Think, Friend, it is God's will That lets our dear one die. It is God's will! So let us try Calmness once more. He knows the best. Our dear one enters into rest, But she shall never die. MAN. Man doth usurp all space, Stares thee in rock, bush, river, in the face. Never yet thine eyes beheld a tree; 'Tis no sea thou seest in the sea, 'Tis but a disguised humanity. To avoid thy fellow, vain thy plan; All that interests a man is man. FOR THE DESOLATE. When, though no loving accents fall In snows upon thy parchÃ«d brow, Yet others unto others call To give the kiss or breathe the vow, Then let thy love for them beguile The self-love that would in thee rise, And bid a softly-welling smile Warm once again thy frozen eyes. When o'er thy brain the passion flows And rolls into thine eyes its tears, Because thy soul no solace knows Of answering hopes and answering fears; Then dash thy tears down as they swell, And give thy grief a strong control, And with a stern derision quell The rising anguish of thy soul. When thy lone dreams sweet visions see, And loving looks upon thee shine, And loving lips speak joys to thee That never, never may be thine; Then press thy hand hard on thy side, And force down all the swelling pain; Trust me, the wound, however wide, Shall close at last, and heal again. Think not of what is from thee kept; Think, rather, what thou hast received: Thine eyes have smiled, if they have wept; Thy heart has danced, if it has grieved. Rich comforts yet shall be thine own; Yea, God Himself shall wipe thine eyes; And still His love alike is shown In what He gives, and what denies. TO A TRUE FRIEND. Bound I am to love you much When the happy chords you touch; Worthier you to be loved best When you make me angriest. THE FLOWER-GARDEN OF GOD. His weeds, however gay, at last Themselves into the oven cast; His flowers He doth for ever prize, And none another may despise. Lily fair accused the Rose Of most flagrant treason:â âHot red flower never blows Heaven's blessÃ«d breeze on! Change your hue, or sun and moon And all earth will hoot you, And the garden-hoe will soon Visit and uproot you!â The pale Primrose sharply blamed The still paler Lily:â âSickly white and monstrous height Make you look so silly! Take my hint and get a tint, Pallid flower unholy! Ape no tree, but be, like me, All compact and lowly.â Harshly Crocus blue the doom Of Primrose rehearses:â âThat pale bloom which you assume Heaven justly curses! Swiftly judgment must pursue The audacious fellow Who, while heaven's self is blue, Ventures to be yellow!â In its turn the Crocus by Violet is abhorrÃ«d:â âScentless bloom! How sad your doom, Well-deserved, though horrid! Though you blue'are, you 're a weed Oven shall devour; It is perfume that indeed Shows the genuine flower!â While each one of all the flowers Thus is rashly giving To the rest not even an hour's Right of longer living, He who grows them, great or small, Deems them none too many, And says, smiling on them all, âI can spare not any.â TO S. N. F. Were my soul as a harp, apt to be moved To magic cadences, O Friend beloved! Were my soul as a harp, and might my hand The cunning of enchanters understand; Ah then, sweet Sister, then should all the air And all the earth and the whole deep rich sea My power feel; that thence all things most fair, Most beautiful, most like, dear Friend, to thee, Might gather'd be; such as, the fragrances Wonderful of the flowers; the splendid dyes Shed by the western sun upon the skies; And from the mines, and from the agÃ«d seas Their selfish hoards of costliest jewelries; Added thereto, all the delicious sounds Wherewith the feathery commonwealth abounds: These should be fetch'd and magically blent Into a glorious nectar; in the which I would embathe my fingers, that the scent Might enter through the strings into the sound Of the new music of mine instrument,â A music thence so wonderful and rich Even should smiles spring in thy gentle eyes, Smiles that must needs, for sweetness, end in tears; While more than mortal harmonies should rise Majestic on the portals of thine ears,â Harmonies beautiful, that through all years Should rise, and deep into thy spirit pass, That like might thus mingle with like. Alas! I have no harp so powerful, sweet Friend; I have no skill thus to make Nature lend Her riches to the instrument I sway: Yet Sister, O my Sister! I can send Petition to the Father, Who ne'er misses To hear prayer for His loved ones; I can pray, And do, indeed, dear Sister, that with thine,â Thy dearest, and thyself,âthe hand Divine May richly bide; that so thy joys and blisses As many as the stars of heaven may be, Or as the kind thoughts my heart bears for thee! HEMLOCK STONE. [Bramcote, near Nottingham.] Thou petrified enigma! Question cold, By Answer unespoused, though ask'd of old! Hoary perplexity! Deep mystery, done Ages innumerable ago in stone! When cam'st thou here? What monstrous means convey'd Thee to this station? What convulsion made Thy red neck rear itself thus haughtily Above the field? What tempests sculptured thee? What ice-float brought thee here, a lonely rock? What wind-wolves howling after fleecy flock Of clouds that 'fore them flee like frighten'd sheep, And press, and crush, and on each other leap, And in fast tears of rain, shed in their terror, weep,â What packs of winds through earth and heaven that range, Gnaw'd thy old bulk into these features strange? Or was 't some insane flood that swept away Thy womb of earth, and bared thee to the day? Or, in its waste and wildness, plough'd and surged, And urged thee on, groaning to be so urged, And set thee up, on this hill-side to stand, By strongest of all handsâa liquid hand?â 'Tis thine a dark enigma to remain; 'Tis mine to guess thee, and to guess in vain. Well might the druid old bow down with awe, And deem thee, when thy uncouth form he saw, An altar cut by Nature's hand in stone, That her God might be worshipp'd thereupon More largely and in more majestic ways Than on those lesser ones which mortals raise: Well might he kindle on thine agÃ«d head The mystic fire, and with lean arms outspread,â His old hair feebly wandering out behind Like tatter'd white flag shivering in the wind,â Invoke the sanction of the gods to fall Upon the solemn ceremonial, While through his eyes wild liquid fire did flow, And the harp trembled and the mistletoe; For to this hour, suggesting incense, thou Still steadiest up a sacrificial brow; And although thou who wast, ages agone, An awful altar, now art but a stone, Yet let my song to God our Maker be As solemn fire to rise once more from thee. What eyes innumerable, O agÃ«d stone, Have gazed, and gazed, thine antique form upon! The woad-dyed savage with his hunting spear Has leapt and stared and wonder'd even here: Haply the Roman soldier here has stood, Stray'd from his camp far into the wild wood: The monk, at least, on palfrey ambling past, Shaken by the rough bridle-road, has cast A hot glance on thee: the knight, steel-array'd, A breathing moment near thy bulk has stay'd To bid his squire behold: gay Cavalier And solemn stern old Roundhead have been here: Lovers and maidens: lords, and squires, and pages: Serf, farmer, village-fool. Ages on ages Of human life hast thou seen onward glide. At last I stand upon thy wither'd side, Another drop of that still-flowing tide. Yes; man in intermittent stream hath flow'd By thee for ages on the neighbouring road; And mortal hearts successive here have beat That now beat nowhere. On thy velvet seat Still stand'st thou solemn: that long multitude Away hath faded, whilst thou, unsubdued By all those ages, hast made good thy claim To hold this station, and art still the same. We change; we vanish; thou, defying fate, Stand'st in thy antique sameness obstinate; Like the huge head, sore battered and time-ridden, Of sphinx whose body 'neath the earth is hidden; Or like a statue of drear Desolation, Rock-carven by some old, mad, plague-smit nation, Dying by hundreds; or, like ancient Lear, With wither'd weed on thine old head for hair; But dead, stone-stiffen'd, not of any daughters Raving, drown'd, ages since, in ravenous waters;â Alas, thou canst not rave, nor speak, nor see; Thou canst but stand in giant idiocy. Now speaks one tongue for both; few years shall run Their course, and it will lack words even for one; And here, where now my flesh speaks, on this sod,â A clod that moves, to an unmoving clod,â Others shall muse, in ages yet to come, And thou be spoken to, when it is dumb; And thine old bulk be gazed at, even as now, When it is cold,âas dull a thing as thou! And thou shalt stand, beautiful times among? Ah hadst thou any to-be-trusted tongue, I might perchance entreat thee to convey Some message down to that high-favour'd day, To say that even in hours so stormy-sad Were some whose eyes saw their day and were glad, And from these deeps of ancient woe and crime Help'd to achieve for them that better time. Lo! how it rises, rises on mine ears,â The mighty music of those unborn years! The billows of that song-sea, how they roll Extravagantly on into my soul! He comes, by all God's royal bards foresung, By pining ages waited for so long! The Christ in man received, for whom her brow The world hath knit in pain, and groan'd till now! He comes for you, ye poor; ye weak, pursue Your glad hosannas, for He comes for you; For poor, for rich, for weak, for strong, He's given, To make of earth a fitting floor for heaven. HERESY. The novel doctrine may be right, Spite of these cries of danger:â The best yard-dogs will bark and bite Alike at every stranger. WOMAN. Weak souls, self-prison'd, scorn their cells, And leap forth freed, when Woman's nigh; Sweet speech, like music-making bells, Rings changes in her thoughtful eye, Glad joy-peals, or slow-tolling knells With echoes from on high. Magic and forceful fires in these,â A woman's smiles, a woman's tears;â Kind furnace fires that can unfreeze Hearts bound in arctic ice for years;â Flames that can ravish whom they seize, And lift to heavenly spheres. Their bliss, from her who nobly seek And get, to sweet hope, meet reply, No traitorous soul can ever speak, Or even in far-off thought descry;â Too blest, for whom first glows her cheek, And speaks new tongues her eye! Talk not of beauty; love will lie Where beauty never boasts to dwell; Love lighted purely from on high, With sweet good sense and truth as well, These, looking forth from Woman's eye, Can weave the strongest spell. 'Tis said, indeed, that Love decays When altar-oaths have join'd the hands; That there's no talismanic phrase Can hold him in enduring bands;â Yes! and when drouth the deer dismays, They flee to other lands;â Yes! and the frost-offended bird Mourns, and at length away it hies;â Yes! and the unkind deed or word, Cold whispers from unloving eyes, When these by Love's fine ear are heard, What wonder if he flies? Love, when by the contracting heart He 's pinch'd and fretted, off may go; The plumage fledging Cupid's dart To strong-quill'd wings, in frost, can grow,â Wings yet reluctant to depart, Slow waving to and fro. O most God-worthy gift, to bless The earth with gracious overflow! Thou, Woman, art true prophetess Of every heaven man shall know.â Ye who her priceless love possess, Oh never let it go! ALADDIN. To take the ring humility, and use, Becomes thee not, Aladdin, to refuse, No matter though thine enemy it be By whom that true self-knowledge comes to thee; Nor shalt thou scorn into the vault to go;â For thee the lamp of wisdom lies below. Pluck thou the fruits that grow on either hand, Although as yet thou mayst not understand Their real nature. To thy present sense Each seems, perhaps, a vain experience, But thou to-morrow each a gem shalt see Cheapening the sultan's signet-ring to thee. CIRCLES. The acorn, earth-trodden, Grows pulpy and sprouts with the rain; Up springs the young oak From seed with might and with main; Its fructified top Comes, lastly, to acorns again. The child's top lies quiet Asleep and inert on the ground. Wind the string, spin the top, See the toy how it whirls round and round, Fast, faster, and faster, Until it again sleeps sound, And motion excessive Joins hands with repose most profound. Like rain weeps the mother In pain for her fever-struck boy;â The fever abating, Hope gives her eyes other employ;â Him quite out of danger Ere long she 'll weep over for joy. Weak, bald, deaf, and blind, The child comes, pity to crave;â Stands erect the young man, Quick, competent, active, and brave;â Weak, bald, deaf, and blind, Old age totters over the grave. SORROW. The flowers live by the tears that fall From the sad face of the skies, And life would have no joys at all Were there no watery eyes. Love thou thy sorrow: grief shall bring Its own excuse in after years:â The rainbow!âsee how fair a thing God hath built up from tears. THE ARBOUR. Silent sits the gentle Evening on the meads With her twilight-retinue; And on grassy threads she strings her dewy beads Yet scantily and few, While her soft breaths give a tremble to the weeds And a tremble to the dew. She hath faintly both the sun and moon display'd On the grey flag that she rears, And the dimness of her dark hair shoots a shade Through the light that disappears Very slowly from her features, all array'd In loveliness and tears. But what shall be her beauty when compared With the human presence fair Of the maiden sitting silent in the bower On the quaint and rustic chair,â The beads impaled upon her lashes, And the darkness in her hair? With high hand to the mastery of the bowe Climbing clematis lays claim, But the honeysuckle's rivalry is bold And eager for the same; And Annie sits as motionless as picture In a flower-abounding frame. Unfinish'd lies her broidery on the table, And the needle is at rest, For her eyes are on the light-absorbing clouds That gather in the west, And her hands, uplifted, unaware are pressing The Book upon her breast. What is it she has done, this gentle maiden, To entitle her to tears?â Ah, feeble lies her father in his chamber, And Annie has such fears As scarcely could she bring herself to whisper Into kindest angel's ears. How still she sits! Scarce may you see her breathe! And let your feet, I pray you, still be shod With silence;ânoiseless be as moth on flower, Or earthworm in the sod;â Intrude not on the sorrow that is seeking The comfortings of God. WILFORD BOAT. [Near Nottingham, 1848.] What, my good friend, Ferry-boat Still in being? Still afloat? Still an engine to convey Me across Trent's watery way? Still a moving bridge to glide Steadily from side to side? Still a bark to carry over Idle or laborious rover, Cottager, or bard, or lover?â More debts even than I know Unto this good Boat I owe, Which hath help'd me, boy and man, Oft to fields Elysian;â Wilford Bank and Clifton Grove, Lovely haunts which lovers love;â To the wildest gardens, where I have breathed enchanted air, And amid the wondering trees Watch'd the fairies' revelries. Oberon I have seen, I swear, And the sweet Titania, there; And the Lady Mab, besides, Who in mossy cleft abides; And the trickster Puck, who glides Long green leaves of arum under, To enjoy the start of wonder And the eyelids wide asunder Thrown, when some sly sound he gives, And the wanderer deceives:â Now it is a splash, and now 'Tis the noise of cracking bough; Or a whistle, shrill and lonely; Or a sound of footstep only, With the which to fool and cheat The traveller: then in retreat Falls, with smother'd laughs, the elf, 'Gainst the stem still props himself, And though still he slyly hides, Arum shakes, as shake his sides. Wilford Bank and Clifton Grove, Lovely land that lovers love, Yes, full many fine enjoyments I have had there; sweet employments; Flower-gatherings; recollections Of the Queen of my affections; High poetic gleams and fancies; Smiling hopes and rich romances; For all which I am in debt To this good Boat: wherefore let Time and chance look kindly on it, And its days sit light upon it; Be its solid timbers long Serviceably hale and strong, And the fates its final date To old age procrastinate; Guarding safe its privileges From upstart usurping bridges. On the chain the pillar grates; Shut, behind, the watery gates, Ope before to let us through. We have one man for our crew, And two passengers has he. Free, yon seat, for me and thee. But if child thou sawest here, Or a woman, plain or fair, Hoary matron or young maiden, Or a man heavily laden With his years, or with a basket, Shouldst not wait until he ask it; Shouldst not sit to let her sue thee; Hard that seat should seem unto thee Till thou didst its service press On them with frank courteousness; Age or weakness,â'twere scarce fitting These should stand and thou be sitting! Here have stood how many feet! Here how many hearts have beat O'er this deck! This selfsame Boat 'Twixt two running streams doth float,â O'er and under;âfor, below, Watery, and, above, doth flow Human tide. Ages ago Two streams at this ferry ran,â River Trent and river Man. The other notch must now receive This handle. Good friend,âwith your leave?â Thank you! Trust me, I must grieve On your comfort to intrude;â Need compels me to be rude;â Here till midnight must we stay Till the helm be put this way. Nearer now yon whiten'd walls Beckon, and the old church calls Us with other voice than bell: So bid we this Boat farewell.â Farewell! Aye, and dear to me Memory of this Boat shall be,â Boat, upon whose actual wood Dear feet, sacred feet, have stood; Feet of gracious, feet of good, Feet of noble Sister sweet, At whose name beloved must beat Fresher pulses, and a heat Must the eyes fill, and a sound Musical the ears; and round Heart the kind thoughts cluster thick As, round magnet, grains of steel,â As, round queen-bee, swarm-bees quick. Thou 'rt far with thy loved one; still Not so far but I can feel Thine effect as lowly calm, Sweet as sound of solemn psalm; And an influence stealing o'er me; And a light that gleams before me; And a voice urging to press On to real holiness, Nor relax the labour now Till I be as pure as thou! Yes, that noble heart hath been Even here; those eyes have seen,â Gentle eyes,âthis very scene; Her foot trod this plank; was set Even here: sprang violet And the primrose as she stept, Surely; and the hard earth leapt To be so happied!â Dearest Boat! Wert thou richest bark afloat; Were thy nails of solid gold, All thy deck with silver roll'd, And complete in luxury; Still, I could not look on thee With that special admiration, With that something love and passion, Wherewith, when thy planks I view, Now for her sole sake I do. Truly I did well to pray Time and chance, from day to day, That they might look kindly on thee, And thy years sit light upon thee, And thy solid timbers long Serviceable be and strong, And the fates thy final date To old age procrastinate; Guarding safe thy privileges From upstart, usurping bridges! WHO SHALL DELIVER? He spake;âfrom vanity, it seem'd to be; Was silent; still he saw 'twas vanity He own'd his vainness; vanity took possession Of that most sad confession. He vow'd to kill the weed, and strove to do 't, And hew'd and hack'd down to the very root: Alas, rank vanity would still be thriving And prosp'ring even in that very striving. Then fell he down and pray'd:âLord, take my breath, And save me from the body of this death. A DREAM OF THE SEA FOAM. I We stood, both silent, by the sounding sea. The waves, like lips about to speak, did rise, Yet shrewdly kept the secret; and the wise Sky o'er us told not our hearts' destiny. Ah, had the future then by me and thee Been but divined, with what endear'd surprise Should we have gazed into each other's eyes And loved, even for the love that was to be! The very flints thou troddest would have been Dear for the time's sake when more dear they'd grow For thy sake,âwhen thy heart on mine would lean As then thine arm on mine did.âNay, not so, Dearest, not so! Our arms were link'd to sever; But when our hearts united, 'twas for ever. II Then, arm on arm; now, heart in heart; ah why Not arm on arm now, too? Why should the dear So seldom be the near? Why are the near, Alas, not always dear? Earth doth supply Too many who the human form degrade. And yet love blesses all, if love is true; And, since we love each other, I and you Doubtless are lending them some hidden aid. Yet 'tis a grief that to these plenteous men,â Too plenteousâI may go, and not to thee; So now I mourn for what I prized not then, And own that now most blessÃ«d seems to me That time, which seem'd not so at that time, when We stood, both silent, by the sounding sea. âTHOUGH HE SLAY ME, YET WILL I TRUST IN HIM.â What if I perish, after all, And lose this life, Thy gracious boon? Let me not fear that I shall fall And die too soon. I cannot fall till Thou dost let, Nor die, except at Thy command. Low let me lie, my Father, yet Beneath Thy hand. 'Tis good to think, though I decrease, Thou dost not, Lord, decrease with me. What matters it that I must cease, Since Thou must be? The life Thou willedst me I use To thank Thee for that gracious will;â If I must lose it, I would choose To thank Thee still. No more might I lift prayerful eyes, Or sway a tongue to grateful tones; Yet should a noise of praise still rise Even from my bones. LOVE'S PENALTY. Alas, the pains a man may bear from foes! Alas, ten times alas, the flood of woes Which to the lover from his loved-one flows! Yet thank God for thy love, e'en though it be As very gall for bitterness to thee. A PREACHER'S SOLILOQUY AND SERMON. THE SOLILOQUY. What wealth to earth our God hath given! What growing increment for heaven! Men, women, youth, and children small, I thank the good God for you all! Not always was it mine to give Such high regard to all who live; Time was, I know, when I could go Along the streets and scarcely see The presences my God did show So lavishly to me. Around my steps,âbefore, behind,â They His creative power declared; I only heeded them, to find The easiest path, as on I fared. And even the innocent little ones, Of value high o'er stars and suns,â Evangelists, by Heaven's decree, Commission'd truths to teach to me That elsewise I had never known,â They seem'd young foreigners to be, They never seem'd mine own. How could I be so dull and blind? How dared I slight God's humankind? I know ye nothing care for me;â Each to each deep mysteries, We cannot guess what we may be Except by what a glance can seize. Perchance we never met before, Meet now the first and final time, Yet are ye mine, over and o'er, That, haply, I may help you climb To Jesus, up the mount divine. Oh might such high success be mine! Fain would I couch your vision dim; Fain would I lead you up to Him! Nay, nay, I cannot yield up oneâ No little child, no youth, no man; I cannot say, Depart from me; I cannot say, Begone, begone, I have no part in thee. No part? But how? Do I not love you? Is not this title still more strong Than if I'd bought you all with gold?â Love strenuous flies, a spirit above you; Try to escape, it will outfly you, It will embrace, ay, and defy you To break away its gentle hold. Because God's love is swift and strong, Therefore ye all to me belong. Why do I dare love all mankind? 'Tis not because each face, each form Is comely, for it is not so; Nor is it that each soul is warm With any Godlike glow. Yet there's no one to whom 's not given Some little lineament of heaven, Some partial symbol, at the least, in sign Of what should be, if it is not, within, Reminding of the death of sin And life of the Divine. There was a time, full well I know, When I had not yet seen you so; Time was, when few seem'd fair; But now, as through the streets I go, There seems no face so shapeless, so Forlorn, but that there's something there That, like the heavens, doth declare The glory of the great All-fair; And so mine own each one I call; And so I dare to love you all. Glory to God, who hath assign'd To me this mixture with mankind! Glory to God, that I am born Into a world, whose palace-gates So many royal ones adorn! Heaven's possible novitiates, With self-subduing freedom free, Princely ye are, each one, to me, Each of secret kingly blood, Though not inheritors as yet Of all your own right royal things, For it were folly to forget That they alone are queens and kings Who are the truly good. Yet are ye angels in disguise, Angels who have not found your wings; I see more in ye than ye are As yet, while earth so closely clings; As through a cloud that hides the skies Undoubting science hails a star Not to be seen by other eyes, Yet surely among things that are, So the dense veil of your deformities Love gives me power away to pull. Alas! why will ye not from sin arise, And be Christ's beautiful? THE SERMON. Ho! every one that thirsts, draw nigh, draw nigh! The drink I offer, Christ's own words supply. Ho! every one that thirsts not, thirst, I cry; Why will ye still neglect to drink,âand die? See, here are living wells; why will ye scorn? Ye unborn, why refuse ye to be born? I call you to repent, oh hear my call! Doth my voice reach you, through the stiff cere-clothes That do enshroud and wrap you up withal? Doth my shout come, a whisper in your ears, As sounds might, travell'd from far distant spheres, Into the ravell'd windings of a cave? O then turn down those cerements of the grave From round about your ears; Let my voice be as thunder; let it roll Into each wakening soul; Come forth, O Lazarus! when I say so Deem me a way wherethrough Christ's mandates flow, And let each buried one attend, and know The stone is roll'd away; Christ calls to him below. Come forth, O Lazarus! when I say so, Let where it lists His Holy Spirit blow, Until each Lazarus comes forth, and know Christ only waits to sayâLoose him, and let him go! His voice delights to set all prisoners free; His blood, His truth, makes all sin white as wool; Oh hear! Oh wash you, cleanse you, and so be Christ's own, Christ's beautiful! LOVE. Love is, if Benedict may be trusted, Mere selfishness behind a mask removed: Ah, Benedict, then, has liked, perhaps, and lusted, But never, never loved! A LOVE-LETTER. No; I cannot thank the care That my feelings sought to spare. Not compliment with compliment Should deal, but man with man. You meant To save me pain, and therefore bent The truth aside. This goes, my friend, Of all true love to make an end. Do you love me? Come then nigh me; Prick me, man! Never relent! Cut and hack and scarify me;â If the truth can make me sore Let me be a wound all o'er:â Do this but with pure intent, I am Yours For evermore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLIFTON GROVE GARLAND. TO ELIZA SUTTON. Thou know'st how I, a child, twined wreaths of flowers And weedsâfor thee, a child too,âin gone hours Of dear romance. Another Wreath is here Made, still, of flowers and weeds. Around the dear Presentment, I have woven it, of thy brow, That they who shall behold this Garland now, Seeing my hand thereon, may also see Thy head therein, and at once mindful be Of me, the weaver, and the wearer, thee. CLIFTON GROVE GARLAND. I. THE WALK. Fieldward, in silent thought, I took my way. Sweet was the air, magnificent the day, The country all with invitation gay. The meadows, whose expanse in season boasts Of crocus-flowers innumerable hosts That by the children's happy hands attain, Through all the town, near every window-pane, Extension of their purple proud domain, I, quickly passing, hastened my descent To where the chain is stretch'd across the Trent, 'Gainst which the upright iron pillar press'd, Grates, turning in its sockets, to arrest The vessel's downward glide, and with least loss Of time and space control its course across. The voyage over, I walk'd on awhile By a sweet way which flowers help'd to smile And trees shed shadow for:âfirst, by a plot Of churchyard grass at Wilford, o'er the spot Where Kirke White's willowonce was; then between Twin rows of elms, like servitors, all green With Spring's fresh favours:âafterwards across The village green, over whose centre toss Old arms of sycamore, and with a fence Of garden'd cots for a circumference:â Then on a bank whose wrinkled elm-boughs spr ead An interference green betwixt the head Of wayfarer and the unbashful sun:â And thus on by fresh pasture, yearly won And lost, by the alternate discontent And shrinking weakness of old warrior Trent;â Then gently to the right, to where are seen Two pillars, with a gate and bridge between, Made for patrician uses, and a plank Or so, hand-rail'd, to serve the meaner rank Of feet plebeian:âthereby going on To the last stile the Grove's precincts upon:â A walk thereafter, still more glorious made With yellow lights and changeful verdurous shade, Near umber tree-boles mossily reprieved From utter brown; and branches freshest-leaved Humouring the pettish little winds, by swinging Ever themselves; and shaded coverts, ringing With feather-throated voices sweet proclaiming The morning's joy:âa walk, thence constant aiming To kiss the river's side, and oft succeeding In its perverse intent; me sometimes leading Under or over a wind-ruin'd tree Whose still green tresses dabbled mournfully In the swift stream that flow'd o'er half its head, And whose lorn fingers, witlessly outspread, Comb'd alway the dark river's flowing hair, And idly took a floating tollage there Of straws and reeds:âa walk whereo'er did stray, In other parts, rootlets across the way, Emboss'd above the red, branch'd manifold, Like wandering veins on arm of gypsy old:â With now and then such roaming for the eye, Such gush of landscape, such broad scenery, Wide water-lapse with dark wind-crimpings grooved, And green enrippled shades, and whites that moved It twisting eddies in it, swirling o'er it At every zephyr's instance; and, before it, Round, and beyond it, such a green and grey, Such blue-deep rapture in the far-away, Such a quick pleasure-presence of the light Exalting all things, dawn'd out to the right, As would have ta'en possession of the eye And it indentured to long truancy, But that it still was summon'd back by old Feet-tripping roots, whose snaky bodies bold Bulged o'er the path, letting the moss to green Their surface gaunt, and to be feathery in Each age-drawn furrow. Such a walk, I say, Had ta'en me, by a long and happy way, Past where we've laugh'd o'er many a violet-prize, And quoted of âthe lids of Juno's eyes;â Past Kirke White's Island, to its willowy head, Above which, to the land tether'd and wed A promontory was by isthmus-band, On which the gold marsh-marigold did stand With wealth of fragrant mint on either hand. II. THE SEAT IN THE GROVE. Waterwards stoop'd a willow there, and bore Its elbow'd root a-kimbo from the shore: There sat I, joyfully. Oh what a strain Of the eye's music vibrated the brain! Fix'd were the heavens above me all in blue, As if they could not dream of other hue; And the pure clouds were still, self-gather'd in, Round, solid-seeming, and edged clear and clean, Save where it look'd as though some hand had been,â Some angel's fingers,âloosening their white hair, Out-combing it upon the azure air. Behind me, branch above branch tiptoe tried Which should hold highest up its leafy pride Above the green bank's high receding side; A crumbling bank, to whose red substance moor'd By many a delicate-intruded cord Were hosts of field forget-me-nots, which made A sapphire light far through the deep green shade;â Forget-me-not, the lover's blue-eyed pet, Whose name he prays his love not to forget, When he has spoken it, until she dies;â Forget-me-not, the flower that alway lies Dearest unto the maiden's gentle bosom;â The flower about whose sweet refreshful blossom The sweetest little stars of yellow hue Shine, each from its own private heaven of blue, Till stars on stars, and skies on skies, uplifted On rough-leaved stems, unite over the rifted Red mother-earth. Ah, what a heavenly calm Blue eye they make the bank to smile with! Psalm By minster-choir sung, can not more praise God's goodness than these flowers do, when they raise Their cheerful faces for the love of day. This bank was further wed, far and away, To widths of greenness other than of grasses: Oft clubb'd together were thick nettley masses Of deep green spitefulness; loth, I'll be bound, No fairest hand to grieve. Meanwhile, around, The deeply cover'd and disguisÃ«d ground, Muffled close in a lighter green, receives, In lesser celandine's heart-hinting leaves, A jaundice from the hot increasing sun, To atone for yellow blossoms o'er and done. Herb-Robert, too, by his mild reds is seen Amid the sapphire and the varied green; Sapphire and green, which the red campion tries To make ev'n yet cooler to the eyes By contrast of his hot and vivid dyes. Meanwhile some fairy,âPuck himself, mayhap,â Hath in green sheath wake-robin tried to wrap, And stuck him for a feather in earth's cap; But the sport comes undone; for, upward pointing His shrouded treasures for the light's anointing, Already is his vesture part unfurl'd. I caution thee, wake-robin, that the world Tempt thee not from beneath that nettle's shade; For never child who once thee has survey'd At but a moment's glance, but straight will tear Thy lush envelopment, to lay all bare The ruddy treasures now half-hidden there. Here, too, is speedwell, heaven-blue darling small, Germander speedwell, frailest flower of all. Out go its little hands toward holy heaven:â What hath it done? What needs it be forgiven? Why this appeal to the all-loving skies? Here too, with melancholy memories, rise Those many verdant cenotaphs, the leaves Of dear departed violets. Spring yet grieves Their early passage from this fleeting state, And leaving of their green homes desolate. A little higher, roots of silverweed Soft silky tongues are thrusting up, to feed On the new air, and taste the spring-tide sun; And here ground ivy hiddenly doth run, Blooming in budded blues along the ground. Here, too, are many other treasures found, The flower-jewels of the banks and fields And lonely places; such as Nature yields To all her friends. But now, what shall I say About the birds, and their melodious play? About the trees, that ripen'd every hour Maturer shadow for this wandering bower? About the sunshine, streaming down the side Of this and that tree which it glorified? About the vagrant bees, that came along, Each with his scrip, and burly beggar's song? About the glorious dragon-flies, that threw Hither and thither their four wings, and drew Blue lustre from the sun with their bright bodies blue? And then, what a most comfortable note, How snug and cosy, gurgled in the throat Of the wood-pigeons; making one to find A sort of fire-side feeling in the mind Of warm'd delight and dear home-friendliness,â Not quite without a hint, nevertheless, Of sweetly smother'd moaning in the tone;â A grief that Comfort deems her very own. Just so is âThank Godâ sharpened with âAlas,â When round the fire we sit at home, and pass The happy glance, then for one moment think How delicate our joy; o'er what a brink It leans; for that the faces which we just Look'd on so gratefully, are only dust At one remove;âbut instantly the sadness Glides back into the trusting, loving gladness.â To special notice, too, must have fair claim That liquid mention of the cuckoo's name Which fitfully from off the island came; Whereat I said, Are there no wood-gods now? The fairies, do they never lift a brow Curious, from behind a branch o'erbent To lick with its green tongues the soft-hair'd Trent? Else I might think, upon some up-swoll'n root In yonder isle, a mellow two-holed flute Some fay or dryad hidden sat and play'd, While cleverly self-hidden in the shade. But, chief of all, note now how gently flow'd With a broad body down his reedy road,â As though in haste, anxious to be caressing Those isles just by there, made for his possessing,â That mid-link of a triple chain, whose ends Are cloud and ocean, his enduring friends, From and to whom he borrows and he lends,â That preacher of Time's lapse, aye eloquent,â That liquid present participle, Trent, Passing, ne'er past. How gently down he went! With what a dreamful whisperiness possest, Mist-like arising from the restless rest Of water-cords gush'd out along his breast;â How tenderly his stream flow'd, with the sky Deep in its bosom,âas might sink and lie A blessing in the heart of duteous child! Flags from his breast, too, would not be exiled;â Nor fish, soft-gliding, waving their light fins;â Sometimes a gallant way one of them wins, Maugre the stream, with tremblings of his sides; Anon his forkÃ«d helm he turns, and glides Off to his fellows in the deeper stream; Then back again as swiftly, with a gleam Of his white flashing side; then up he rises Sometimes, and with a hungry leap surprises The surface into waves and drops, which, falling, And on the sun for recognition calling, Are turn'd to special gold before they sink, And leave a ripple which the river's brink Might soon feel swelling to its shoremost sedge, But the ridged currents cut it with their edge And plane it down. While thus the river roll'd, Beyond it many a field wide place did hold, Joyful to show its wealth of green and gold;â Green, of the grasses, which were now just fledging Their waving ears unto a flossy edging; And gold, of dandelions, fiercely burning Against the sun, whose anger was fast turning Into white blindness their presumptuous gaze. Kingcups were there, too, with their gentler blaze, Shining back softly on the shining sun, Like gratitude on service kindly done. Afar off, to the left, confusedly, all A-row, nine poplars stood,ânine sentries tall Guarding the farmer's stacks and stead and stall, Rustling their plumes o'er the thin-shadow'd field; And, opposite, the church at Beeston held Its little turret on its manly shoulder, As father might his child, to be beholder Of some far spectacle. Many a home Half-cover'd from the eye by the green foam Of foliage toss'd up by vague winds, was set About the distant meadows. Thus I let Mine eyes drink the ripe vintage of the scene In various draughts of blue, and grey, and green; Pleasured,âyet sad, so little to be free To accomplish what so strongly yearn'd in me. III. THE MUSING HOUR. For have we not oft said,ââTo whom 'tis given To be, for Art's pure sake, entirely shriven Of other work, how blest!âto whom 'tis lent To put off from their feet all detriment, And stand for ever on Art's holy ground?ââ What favour, to be lost, and only found By fellow-worshippers, enrapt amid The symbols and the mystic meanings hid In Nature's core;âsometimes in some huge tree To stretch out glorious arms, a shield to be To timorous flowers; or, in a stream on-sliding, To fill one's groovÃ«d saddle, and be riding On subject earth; or in a cloud to mount, And see the river Morn gush at its fount, Before its flood the skies hath overswum; Or in a mountain to stand, old, and dumb, And many-climed; or in a vale to lie All green and beauteous 'neath the Maker's eye; Thus to run through all the amazing range Of form, hue, sound; being and seeing,âstrange Yet truly,âblended into one; till, fired Inly, one wrought out with a hand inspired Some glorious stone or picture, or indited Poems or anthems glorious: so, delighted, Live on, holding one's self in full requited For faithful work, by finish'd work's assoyl; And at the last turn humbly from the toil To say, âO Lord, burnt out is all the oil Thou fill'dst this lamp of life with!ââwhile around The bow'd head, âWell done, servant good!â should sound. For the true Poet pares not his work's claws, Nor draws its teeth, to humour fashion's laws; Nor thaws, like slug, neath critic salt, to fall And melt to an unmeaning slimy scrawl:â Nor is it to be Artist, to be loud Crying one's wares, and pushing in the crowd; To hang the head and faint, because there 's none But the great God to smile, and say âWell done!â To peep o'er this man's shoulder, and feel mad If he excel; or to turn meanly glad At passing that man; thus with envy swelling Of others, or with pride at self's excelling;â To fret and fever, for that popular praise Doffs not its lackey-cap, nor Raleigh plays, Cloak-carpetwise, to our Elizabeth;â No:â'tis to hang upon the holy breath Of Nature's teachings, and to stretch the mind As a string to be play'd by, of each wind Of sincere impulse, the imperial finger; It is, to cast all else away, to linger, A glowing lifetime through, at the great wells Beside whose sacred runnings beauty dwells, And flowers of self-sacrifice aye live; It is, with love and reverence, to give Room in us for the Maker, and to spend Life wholly 'mid the influences which lend Strange power of creation to the creature; It is to give back Nature's each true feature, And glass her surfaces by the control Of that which shapes them,âtheir interior soul; It is to make perfection our election, And, choosing that, to aim at that perfection; So to accomplish a right worthy thing And be a world-enricher; than a king More glorious, though his fighting flag unfurl'd Bore on it all the escutcheon of a world;â Only less glorious than is he whose strife Is to perfect, not merely Art, but Life. We know, full well, how oft bread-getting need Spoils all; how oft necessity, indeed, The neck of many a crowing purpose wrings; And breaks up costliest harps, and makes their strings Tie parcels, or converts them, one by one, To cords to hang out vulgar clothes upon; And baulks the Muse of many a golden voice That should have left age after age no choice But to be glad for, which our streets must find Now singing toys to sell or knives to grind:â Call it not cruel: hard it seems; but still It is not cruel, if it is God's will. If thou know'st any one who mid the flowers Which the birds sing to in their sunny hours May not thus live, nor be as I have said, Haply it is because he could not wed Art, without suffering loss. Had rain and sun Been giv'n, perhaps his ground had overrun With dark and hateful weeds of vanity. 'Tis true, he never now the fount shall see Wherefrom all mighty poets influence draw, To sing to deathless time the primal law; Yet may he just as well fulfil his day, And do his work as faithfully, as they. IV. SEDLEY GROVE. See Childhood of Mary Leeson, by Mary Howitt. Thus flow'd thought, and the Trent flow'd, and the time; Until had ceased the unharmonic chime Of feather'd flutes; no finny sporter leapt; For the hot afternoon had, king-like, kept For some time now the throne whereon, at last, he slept. Whether the heat made me also to doze And dream, or not, that man may tell who knows; But, all at once, the place had changed its style From Clifton Grove, to Sedley; and the isleâ The largest of the three above whose heads The river broaden'd by me,âtwo, mere beds Of osiers, but the third a glassy plain,â Was Mary Leeson's empire once again. Sudden I heard owls' bass tu-whits, which seem'd To multiply behind me; and there scream'd The treble of some mystic chanticleer; And dogs' barks and sheep's bleatings took my ear. A moment's wonderment, and then loud laughter Its merry gamut ran; and, soon thereafter, I saw inside a boat upon the Trent Two pairs of white shirt-sleeves, alternate bent At elbow and then straighten'd out again, In which were thrust the stout arms of two men, Whose heads over their crooked knees stoop'd low One instant, and, the next, jerk'd back to throw, With tight-held breath, weight on the oar, whose pull Against the current, makes the boat, though full Of freight, thrust forward its sharp eager nose, And give a wrestling leap-up as it goes. Meanwhile, under its side, two upside-down And watery-looking things wagg'd each a crown, As the men's wagg'd above; and elbows four, In liquid white shirt-sleeves, tugg'd each its liquid oar. Other reflections, too, were there, related To other counterparts, wherewith was freighted That boat; a pleasant aristocracy, That sat, and nothing did but laugh out free, Add burden to the vessel, jest, and make A pleasure of what gave the bones to ache Of those two workers:âthese were, Mary's mother For one; and sweet aunt Emmeline another; And little Mary of the soft blue eyes And pale child's face, so merry, yet so wise; Old Mr. Fenton, too, the vessel bore, Man of dull sight, but deep canary-lore; And wonderful Charles Sunderland, who held The tiller, and his peace. Thus on impell'd By uncle Edward's usage of the Trent, Vig'rous, and Mary's father's, up they went; Till out of sight the pleasant vision drove, And left me once again in Clifton Grove. V. THE WALK RESUMED. Then from my lowly seat recess'd rose I, And slowly went, still westward, and still by A path uxorious of its river-bride;â Sometimes must I an ill-bred branch aside Shoulder, which had no manners, and so tried Rudely to stop me; or else be off-striking, From body clad but little to my liking, A nettle's head; or halting to inspect Some wondrous wingÃ«d thing, whose presence deck'd A leafy tablet; or else, inward sinking The sense, indulge a pleasant vein of thinking Concerning absent friends, with many a yearning For some such presence here; or else concerning Some problem to be solved, be sure, by no deep learning. Thence soon recall'd by whirr and frighten'd flap Of wings close by; or by the clambering clap Of sheep's hooves loosening down the crumbling clay; Or by the even-timed and vig'rous play Of coney's hinder feet, as, terrified, One scamper'd up, its tufty tail to hide In its red hole; or by the plunging dash Of eager vole retreating with a splash Of sharp excitement;âand once, by the scene Of kingfisher at sport. With eye full keen, He sat upon an overhanging bough, And spied right under him, by gristly prow A gudgeon slit the water, which again Upon her wake closed in. The shining bird Dropp'd down on her, before his flight was heard, Digging into the stream with all his weight, Then rose up in a moment with a freight Of struggling fins and flashing scales, and took The booty to his deep and secret nook. The cliff, still kept undress'd by wind and weather, Now stares abrupt above us; put together By clayey flood and flood; compact of red By turns, and greenish white, bed upon bed, 'Mong which some sparsest gleam of gypsum shines. Beneath this sauntering, come we where inclines A lane up the art-mitigated side Of that same cliff; a lane to southward leading 'Twixt red-sloped banks, and upward so proceeding Past tree and shrub, past half-curl'd fern and flower;â Under the hall;âbeneath the old church tower;â By the dark-shrouded lodge;âthen eastward going 'Mong cots, with almost little gardens growing On their old thatch, so rich in weedy store;â Whose gardens, too, beside them, or before, Make poverty look fair inside each open door. These partly passing, soon is there discern'd A stone-stepp'd stile, over the which I turn'd; And then of two fields for a little while Fretted the path; till, at the final stile, Once more was I in Clifton Grove; but now To deal no longer with its foot, but brow. VI. THE LOCAL CLASSICS. There sat I on that entrance-bar, and glean'd My thrifty limbs some ease-ears, while I lean'd Forwards to think. No wandering breath of thought The minutes lately to my mind had brought; But now an inner wind came, and wide stirr'd Thought's branches in me, and once more I heard The rustlings of fancy's foliage; Whereat my mind 'gan fill with life, like cage Wherein, like birds, glad young thoughts fluttering sung, Till with the noise that aviary rung Of strivings sweet, melodious, to think Of them who 'twixt this neighbourhood a link Have welded, and the Muses; to recall Our local Classics' names, books, fates, and all. Thus musing, sudden I a footing-sound Heard in the grass; and,âmy eye turning round To ask its silent question,âthen beheld A youth, slow pacing, unawares impell'd By blind thought, and ignoring all the while Me vaulted on the saddle of the stile, Till with a knee up-bent, seeking to pass My three-ribb'd horse, he lifted from the grass His meditative eyes. And then he made More haste, as if to escape some ambuscade. Meanwhile I had determined to invade His privacy, and did so;âby degrees, Walking and talking, we were both at ease: Till the high boughs that shadow'd us began To be the boughs whose roots deep underran The very eastern entrance of the grove; While, Kirke White so desiring, I unwove The history of those newer names which made These trees to shed of more than trees the shade. Such interest was shown in this rehearsing, And we so all-absorb'd in our conversing, As to arrive unwitting in our walk So near a troop, as let them almost stalk And poach upon the manor of our talk:â At whom, intently looking, âSee,â I said, âThese are ev'n they of whom just now we made Such pleasant mention!â First to lead the van, Miller, the basket-maker, was the man: Him follow'd Spencer Hall; and, them succeeding, Came Mary Howitt, with a warm hand leading Your old friend Mary Leeson tenderly; Behind which gentle twain what eye to see Charles Pemberton could miss, and William Howitt? And others too, if this tale might avow it. These being introduced to, soon began Our talk to gambol, coney-like, and ran Its wild feet into merriest of vagaries; And not a laugh was heartier than Mary's,â Who, though the years that to her being went Tow'rd ripening her brain had influence lent But nine times, yet was very seldom slow To comprehend whatever wit might flow. 'Twas little Mary too whose watchful eye In its blue, eager, happy vagrancy, Ne'er wearied of observing, first espied One who came down the grove, dark-hair'd, deep-eyed, And groundward-looking; but, I will be bound, Not seeing aught he look'd at on the ground. âWho's that, that throws a shade on th' air around,â Ask'd White, âas if he bore clinging about him Some cloud which loved and could not live without him?â âWhy! I declare, it is our own good friend,â Said Mary Howitt, glad; âtell him to bend His steps this way.â Towards us then he came, And, through my previous mention of the same, Kirke White heard gladly Philip Bailey's name. The greeting o'er, ourselves once more we bent Over the rising greenness, as intent To reach almost the far head of the grove; And still in merry guise the talk would rove, And the glad minutes danced away full fast Until we came to the top stile at last. There ever paused a host of living green On the cliff's side; with silent, solemn mien The warrior-trees seem'd up the height to press Upon the foe, in southward earnestness, Shaking their green crests o'er their rugged mail, Or laying them along the southern gale; And halting, as their front ranks were well planted Where the hill's cope a level footing granted: While the advanced guard, thrown across the way, Open'd, between, a green floor to the day. We, too, stood silent; for each strove to seek To hear, feel, see,âdo anything but speak Where Silence seem'd to hush, and stand apart To listen to the beat of its own heart: There through the half-leaved boughs came broken gleams Of sky with glory flooded, streams on streams; And we all stood at gaze, nor could control, Nor would, the exaltation of the soul; For heaven's azure calmness did but lean Serenely o'er what was no less serene; And the glad sunshine in the yellow west Smiled on its counterpart in every breast. At length, our tongues that spell could bear to break, Needing relief; and something some one spake About a conclave, whereat it was meet Festus should take the presidential seat.â âAy, Festus for our president!â we said All in one breath; but Festus shook his head, And motion'd that Kirke White should take the chair As being the oldest Clifton Classic there. âHear, hear!â we said, with cheers; and though in spite Of protestation from the modest White, Miller and Hall, with many a merry smile, Bore him and his resistance to the stile, Where under strong persuasion he relented, And finally to sit thereon consented. Against the elm hard by, her mother's knee Press'd little Mary; and the green turf we; And after brief discourse, it was agreed Some homespun thing each should recite or read. First, Mary's mother spoke, when by request Of all she to comply was strongly press'd:â Perhaps, she said, she might, not being able To show aught written, tell a simple fable; And then, with somewhat of apology For what she call'd its childishness, which we Scarcely concurred inâshe went on to say That once upon a time,âthough many a day Had slept beneath the mossy coverlet Of Time since then,âspeedwell, the earth's wee pet, The little blue-eyed darling of the flowers (Blue-eyed, like Mary), had pass'd all its hours In a sweet morning, grieving; hung its head; And almost thought it might as well be dead As live on so, no benefit supplying To any living thing; and saying, sighing, âThe others may be useful, but I can Do good, neither to insect nor to man.â Thereby at length there went a maiden pale, The woful heroine of a woful tale; Flerceness was in her heart; and, in her eyes, Harsh imprecation of the holy skies:â Till the subduing sight of that calm flower Turn'd her untearful pride into a shower Of wholesome grief, and left her once more free To pray for strength to bear. âBut stillâ (said she) âThe little blue-eyed baby of the flowers, Germander speedwell, pass'd the morning hours In weariness and grief, and hung its head, And almost thought it might as well be dead As live on so;âsaying, âAlas, I can Be useful, nor to insect, nor to man!â' âShe ceased: but Mary, still the tale pursuing, Ask'd,ââDid it ever know the good 'twas doing? And what became of it?âââI cannot tell,â Was all the answer.ââAh,â said Hall, âhow well That little tale deserves to be repeated To many a weary soul, unkindly treated By age or illness. And how true, that when We bloom to God, we thereby bloom to men, Although we may not dream the good we do!â Then Kirke White said to William Howitt, âYou, Sir, are the next, to give us tale or song;ââ Who answer'd, he would not detain us long, Having no tale; but just give an exact Statement of what, we might depend, was fact. It was (and here methought I might espy A sort of under-twinkle in his eye) Touching the singular catastrophe That once befel the cuckoo; for that he Formerly had but one long shout, in lieu Of the two short ones which so well we knew; Till fate to take his voice's penny came, And gave him change in halfpence for the same. For one day, as it happen'd, Mistress Eve, Cutting her hair, her scissors chanced to leave Where, too, the hungry cuckoo chanced to get them, And, rather fancying he might like them, ate them; But the twin blades, his throat in passing through, Unfortunately snipp'd his shout in two. Our laughter over, we requested next Of Pemberton, some song, or storied text, Until he said, a fable in plain dress He would attempt; yet 'twas for Mary's sake; Not from the thought that we should interest take In such a trifle;âthen went on to say That oft, at what we thought was night,âthough they Know nothing there but one long, happy day,â There was a feast, for holy gladness given At souls redeem'd, among the sons of heaven; And that at all those festivals divine The angels drank the smiles of God for wine; And that the stars were crystal cups, whereby Their awful contents shone adown the sky; And that the moon was the great chalice there Wherefrom each lesser one received its share. He said, too, that the angels oft conceived Something that would be grief, if angels grieved; A dry tear, shed because man, wayward child Of sin, from those glad banquets was exiled; And that the broad sheet-lightning, which at nights Streams down upon us, and our souls affrights, Was but a goblet of that awful wine Pour'd out by one of those kind ones divine, Thinking a happy favour to bestow, Unknown to th' others, upon men below:â And that it was our sin turn'd what was sent To make us glad, to terror's instrument; So terrible, so full of painful fear To sinful eyes do all things pure appear: Wherefore, he argued, evermore we should Strive to become more wise, and pure, and good, That so in all such favours we might see The blessings they were really meant to be. During the telling of this simple tale I had been watching little Mary's pale Most earnest face: open'd were her soft eyes On Pemberton, wide with their blue surprise; And when the story had just breathed its last, A sideway glance on the far sky she cast, As if ev'n then some angel might be shedding Some such remembrance kind:âthen, overspreading Her face with streamy smiles, to soul deep-wed, âO yes, we will be good!â the young enthusiast said. Whereat a happy smile flow'd o'er each face; And 'twixt the kiss and the half-hid embrace Which Mary's mother gave her, I could note Of thanks a garland through the air to float To Pemberton, for his high brow's possessing, Wov'n of the flowers of a mother's blessing. Meanwhile a paper had been dropp'd beside The stile by Kirke White unawares,âespied By us, who saw th' inscription on its face Was that of the old legend of the place. Eager, we seized it, and when White had shown No wish to read it, it not being his own, Into this service Pemberton impress'd, Agreed to give it us at our request; And his good-nature straightway, as a bow, To this result, with powerful to-and-fro, To the bass-viol of his voice did go:â VII. THE FAIR MAID OF CLIFTON. Long, long ago,âlet us not know how long,â Are not all love-tales ever old and young?â Long, long ago, two young folk's faces flamed In flushes, when each other's name was named; Two young lives were in music-step advancing, Each cymbal-playing to the other's dancing; Two young hearts beat in sympathetic beating; Two hands oft parted that would still be meeting, And meeting still for ever, and aye parted As if hand-sunder'd meant being broken-hearted; As it hath been, too, since the first day passed; And as it will be, even unto the last. Touch'd largely by the sun, the river roll'd; The Midas-sun turn'd all he touch'd to gold. Abroad were all the little winds, and free Leapt they and flitted blithe from tree to tree, Laving their streamy bodies in those lakes Of rippled leaves, whence soon each wind-elf breaks With strugglings, from the clutches of the boughs, Then shakes herself, and from her sides allows Some single leaves to fall,âdrops of the green Leaf-element she has been bathing in. Manifold voices, too, in various sport, The would-be silence must obstruct and thwart; Perhaps the thrush, whose joy is getting free In bounteous breaks of bubbling melody; Or the glad lark, who will praise God, then rise To carry his own praise up to the skies,â Praise full of thanks melodious and strong, Thanks, which their lives exultingly prolong In shakes, and trills, and spirts, and dancing drops of song. All these are only representative Of what in Bateman's inner world doth live; No voiceful joy there, but its counterpart Finds in the singing of young Bateman's heart; No little wind so gladly skips, but it To Bateman's thoughts shall be a symbol fit; And how can Trent in such a glory roll As to excel the glory in his soul? For love is with him. The grass feels his feet Earnest with love. In love strive and compete His manly curls, to twine around the breeze. 'Tis love that majesties those common trees To an exalted grandeur; gives a dye Of alien blue divine unto the sky; Makes of winds, rushing odours; reveals flowers As live joys, leaf-disguised; finds bridal bowers In vaguest clouds; shows, all things all things kiss; And makes the flowing Trent a flowing bliss:â In love his pulses musically move; Live joys within him clap their hands, for love. Look how, as 'twere a spirit, o'er the meads He walks, but wists not of it; and proceeds, Nor thinks how feet have dealings with his pace: Joy smiles, a shining cherub, from his face, And sings, for the eye's hearing! Sure, not air It is he breathes;âno, it must be the rare Life-element for which we mortals pine;â This Bateman hath been favour'd with the wine The angels press from heaven-grapes!âAh, who'd be Other than Bateman, if they might be he? Now is he by the boat,âthe church,âthe green,â The shady broad embankment; now doth lean His steps to pass the little wooden bridge; Now uses he the lover's privilege To spy his love farther than others can. Lo! in him breathes all the immortal man, And in his lordly joy he can behold The fields, the trees, the stream, the clouds of gold,â All that great Nature hath, around, above, To pity them, because they may not love His Margaret, nor kiss her queenly hand;â Can look around him proudly, with a grand Vouchsafing majesty,âto patronise, In love's self-glorying, almost the skies;â Can wonder other men should be so blind As not love Margaret; and is inclined All feeling to condemn as naught compared With that which he and Margaret have shared;â Thinks the wind breathes of Margaret, therefore brings Such a sweet freshness in its welcomings:â Hardly conceives the landscape used to know The way in proper loveliness to glow,â Or flow'rs to bloom well,âtill they did espy In her the occasion to be handsome by:â Finds in his heart fresh praisings of her grace, And blessings of her bright refreshful face:â Loves the dear grass she treads on, with a gush Of gratitude, that it hath served to hush, Smoothen, and ease the motion of her feet:â While in his heart joy crowds two beats in every beat! Madness indeed! Yet ask again,âWho'd be Unlike the lover, if they might be he? Who, sane, would still be so, and not be glad To be as finely and as nobly mad? Nay, let us be no spies upon their meeting, But softly step aside. The lovers' greeting Befits not alien eyes. There were but birds And beasts to hear young Adam's glowing words, And Eve's, in happy Eden. So let these Have their own Eden perfect. Let them seize Kind comfort, hand from hand, even as they meet Where, near the trees, the gate doth plant its feet At foot of the smooth rising. Let them walk Up through the Grove unwatch'd, and in their talk Foredream a gorgeous future. Let them say Their bliss o'er to each other,âwhile they may! At length, their voices strengthening, we indeed Cannot but hear their words. They do not heed. He sees not, nothing knows, nor dreams, unless Of Margaret, and how her hand to press Kindly enough, and how contrive to gaze Longest in her sweet eyes, and make dull air Into such living words as should be there:â âI have been all the night long wandering In dreams, o'er dreary ways, which would not bring My aching heart to where it wish'd to go.ââ âAy, so you say,â she says; âbut do I know? Sometimes I'm half disposed your love to doubt.â âWhy, Margaret dear!âââNay, nay, I'll have it out,â The pretty Wilful said, and, all the while, Began to steal a little truant smile From school, about her mouth, and dare to sport In its new liberty, her face athwart; And now her voice is toned more tenderly:â âLet me complete my speech. Were I to be A man, and loved, I'd get a ring, and take it, As I take this, between my hands, and break it, And give one half to her, as now I do To you, and say, as now I say to you, Dear Henry, keep this for my sake,âa token That, though gold breaks, my love can ne'er be broken. âHe took the slender moiety; he raised His gradual-understanding eyes, and gazed On her deep blushes, like a thing amazed, Till his joy shone out liquid in his eyes. Had he been rapt then into paradise, And heard the viols and the trumpet-start Angelical, I know not that his heart Could have sent brighter flushes to his face. They stand together, in that lonely place, Near to the eastmost cliff, just where a deep And red ravine is plough'd adown the steep: Together, taller for their joy, they stand; Each throbs a new pulse in the other's hand, A little delegated heart, there sent By the great heart, its joy to represent And beat for it, to own the endearÃ«d touch. They of glad loving-kindness hold as much,â And do not perish by it,âas e'er held The human earthen vessel. But impell'd, As it might be a wing'd and pointed pain, At last was, from thought's bow in Margaret's brain, Shot;âwhereunto responding, âWhy suspect,â Said Bateman, âthat your father may object?â ââHe may not; and yetâHenry, won't you call On him to-morrow,âand so tell him all?â ââTo-morrow?âit is soon;âyet you are right; His leave I'll have before to-morrow night!â Hopeful he spake; and yet this doubting-stone Turn'd sideways joy's full stream. There stray'd a tone Of sadness through their talk. She whispers: âFate Has oft avail'd hearts even to separate That loved, perhaps, almost as much as ours.â ââAh! what if on us, too,â he says, âtheir powers The Furies try? Would then this pledge of gold You gave, and that eternal promise, hold? Perhaps your constancy might then be seen To break, as this ring broke!ââWith alter'd mien, As hurt, she turns, the while a solemn thrill Shakes in her voice; vowing, she never will Forsake, or cease to love him; and she prays All earnestly, that if her heart strange ways Should take from Bateman wandering, Heav'n may frown, And bid its awful servants drag her down That red ravine, and drown her in those deeps! ââMargaret! you frighten me!ââShe stands and weeps. Woe's me, what interruption's this appears And brings such new, strong reason for her tears, And puts such fresh disorder in her mien? âNot Margaret's father?ââNay, child, you are seen; And you, sir,âwho are you?ââHard, haughty speech Hurls he at Bateman. They stare, each on each. Vain explanation is essay'd. At length,â His daughter's trembling weakness on his strength Of arm supporting,âthe proud man retires, And leaves young Bateman choking in his fires. At first they had flared forth past all control.â Like gleaming sword from sheath, he from his soul Had drawn wrath sharp and forceful on his foe;â His foe?âWhat! Margaret's father?âNo, ah no! That must not be. He let the weapon go. There stood he like a man who inly burns, But all his flame to smoke and stifling turns. Then slowly fell to naught the enragÃ«d start And thumping of the hammer of his heart; And all the sorrow of the thing came o'er him, And the drear desolation spread before him Through the waste, pining years. And if he wept Let us be glad he did so. Some have kept From weeping, till the tears within supprest Have put a ranker sap in growths unblest, And forced up deadly nightshades of the heart, Or soak'd and rotted all the better part To pestilent corruption. 'Tis a sign, If Bateman weeps, some hidden hope must shine A sun above him, to draw up his tears From the deep heart-well. Soon, more bravely bears The boy his grief. Less absolute, he thinks, The bitterness of the sad cup he drinks. Love lies a-bleeding, but the injured flower May yet its healing find in sun and shower. Shatter'd, no doubt, much tempested and tost His love's barque may be, but it is not lost. He'll go, he says, and toil for Margaret's sake; He is but young yet, and can wait, and make Wealth o'er that sea which soon must be between Hearts which asunder'd never should have been. But he must see her first. Therefore he hies Next day, soon as the sun doth in the skies Lift up the frontal of his golden head. Like any houseless ghost poor Bateman sped,â An anguish at his heart, and stinging goads; And so he nears the house of Gerard Rhodes, Where Margaret is, but where he may not be,â Alas! alas!â He lean'd against a tree, The sunlight round him by the night within Balancing:âand as if peace he might win By counting up the past, over he goes The whole sum from its origin to close:â How they first met,âfirst spoke;âhow he essay'd To think of winning such a peerless maid;â All her sweet looks, words, motions, innocent;â What made him first think her heart tow'rd him bent;â How ominously once with him it went When, having made a carven H and M In loving nearness, and there married them With blessings, and a ring cut in the rind Of a smooth tree,âthenceforth he ne'er could find Those young initials, though he sought and sought With careful diligence. Thus back is brought Each least event, down to the recent blast That tore love's joyous banner from its mast;â Not one heart-breaking detail is he spared; But with a dismal bias all the bared And blighted rows and borders of the whole Late garden, but now desert of his soul, He traverses, and mourns his wither'd flowers, And, weary, lengthens out th' enormous hours. Over and o'er again the account he sums Of his great grief:âand yet no Margaret comes. She frets within close guard. At last, away He breaks himself from the intent to say Farewell, as loth as, by a hand forlorn, The shrieking mandrake hardly might be torn Up by its roots, in any ancient tale. That day goes Bateman, eager, pining, pale, To a sure friend, whom he entreats to bear A message to poor Margaret; tells him where; Shows him the kernel of the story sad; Conjures him, by the friendship which he had, To help their correspondence to and fro, And never let her cruel father know:â All which is promised. A most speedy breeze Bears Bateman far off o'er the sundering seas. Why should I be at needless grief to tell The moaning mischief which on Margaret fell, And brought her death a-knocking at her door?â Or what a tedious watching 'twas before Her friends might comfort to each other give, And, smiling, in low whispers say âShe'll liveâ? For thus at last they did. Thenceforth, what bliss, Of all the sweet sad past, was left, but this,â Still the old walks to go, and, at each spot, Say,ââHere he gave me the forget-me-not,â As if 'twas possible I could forget!ââ Or,ââHere he first dared say âMy Margaret!ââ Or,ââThis is where he oftenest loved to go;ââ And each old joy's grave make new tears to flow? âThus, slowly, went the weeping-time forlorn, Till from their myriad husky cradles torn Fell the grandchildren of that season's corn. Ah me!âWhat is there in the scope and range Of this wide, wasted world, but change on change? This Margaret, this ring-breaker, the unwed But oath-bound bride of Bateman, shall be led Into the church, and married by a man In whose veins blood of Bateman never ran! âWhy should you start? this is no such strange thing To need a special note of wondering. âWhy should you start? I tell you, deeds are done, Ay, every hour, beneath this smiling sun, Which neither tears, nor tearing of the hair, Nor howling,âno, nor even sheer despair Gnawing its own flesh,âcan enough declare. It is no new thing, love's flow'r should be found Prone to be withering in a shallow ground; What wonder, then, if Margaret should drink Lethe from time's cup, and forget to think Of him who ne'er forgot to think of her? Ay, though she may have watch'd, and would not stir For hours from the window, when she thought A letter from poor Henry might be brought; Then, when she saw it, snatch it, just as food Would be snatch'd up by famine;âbrood, and brood O'er it, and every lonely moment seize From each part its remotest sense to tease; Seem almost to have read it when it came, Through her long hope and yearning for the same; Appoint it sanctuaries wherein to rest,â Nightly, her pillow; or, by day, a nest Near the heart beating in her breathing breast; Still over to herself be whispering Each phrase as a delicious thought and thing; Wish each line double, and find every one A thing to smile, tremble, or weep upon; Know every crease and fold in every part, And almost have each least stroke off by heart: All this may be, and yet be overpast, And Bateman's letters go unread at last. Her sire neglected no device to catch Her slow consent to the eligible match; And, if her secret thought were known, 'twas part Of the self-lauded motion of her heart To deem it bounden duty to obey, And let her heartless father have his way, Though her best welfare he had thrust aside Only to bloat his mean and vulgar pride, And though it ne'er seem'd duty, till her mind Its dial-hand from Bateman had declined, And till she thought, perchance if she refuse Germaine, she may the ease and pleasure lose And pride of reigning as a household queen, Above the level of those who had been Her maiden equals.âTherefore doth she falter A perjured âYesâ to Germaine at the altar. Who'd now be Bateman?âAh, who would not be Other than Bateman, if they now were he? Her letters ceasing, the boy can control His heart no more. He comes home,âlearns the whole. Then sits he down, and leans upon his hand A head confused, and strives to understand The whole tale; and thus reads its meaning o'er:â It is, to stand by Margaret no more; Nor feel the warmÃ«d pressure and the pride Of her confiding arm against his side; Nor learn her looks by heart; nor watch arise The pleasure of his presence in her eyes; Never to sit with her in secret bower, Or comfort her in any weeping hour; Never to lean o'er her closed eyes, and make A gentlest stirring lest from sleep she wake; Never to be her champion in the strife, To affray her griefs and smooth her path of life; Never to serve, her faithful minister, Or have a right even to be kind to her:â All such hopes now for him are dead and gone, Buried, and cover'd up, and stampt upon, And have no rising. All that was amass'd For his possession in the splendid past Untoâa broken ring hath shrunk at last! There be great spirits can consent and smile At Fortune's grossest felonies, even while Their treasures 'tis she steals,âwith tearless eyes Gaze in the face of the bereaving skies,â And answer to misfortune's keenest smart With the big beat of a majestic heart. Alas! Not such was Bateman. The half-ring By letter, and by chance the news, they bring Of a young corpse whereon these lines are read:â False woman, of thy vows and oaths have dread, For thou art mine by them, alive or dead! There faded Margaret from that fatal hour, As from its sick roots a worm-haunted flower, For she began to be all overrun With creeping thoughts of what her fault had done. Sit could not she, nor stand, nor rest for long In any place; but memory of her wrong Wrought as an evil fret upon her brain, And gave her in fresh postures unto pain. Ah, sure, had Bateman thought what might betide Her by his dying, thus he had not died! Poor girl, poor girl! She eats not, does not sleep, And frets and burns with fever; cannot sleep, But makes, with restlessness, in many a heap Disorder rise and sit about her bed: And ever to one same plaint is she wed, Moaning,ââAlive or dead! alive or dead!â Two kind-soul'd neighbours near her bed forlorn A-watching sit; for a child hath been born; And see, the mother sleeps!ââOh, do not stir, Now such a wholesome thing hath fallen on her!ââ So they sit quiet, till their drowsy eyes Notice no more the shadows fall and rise And dance round the night-taper. Morning breaks, And leaps in at the window, off the flakes Of its sun-lighted clouds.âOne wakes, and wakes Her co-nurse. Chilly is the morning air. They look into the bed; they feel; they stare! Still warm her place, yet Margaret is not there! Calm, calm in Clifton deeps the Trent doth flow, But down that red ravine, an hour ago, Did Margaret run therein and sink below. The nearest villagers awoke, 'tis said, At hearing, as they shook upon their bed, A piteous wailing of âAlive or dead!ââ Nor do they a false verdict give, who tell That Margaret was borne off by fiends of hell;â Remorse and madness serve the infernal crown, And these the demons were that dragged her down. VIII. CONCLUSION. The deep voice ceased. I lifted up my head. Had I been sleeping? Was the vision fled? The sharp and sudden silence seem'd to make The Loneliness upon her couch to wake, And half rise on her arm, and cold, serene, Majestic, distant, like a conscious queen, Silently, calmly, gaze me in the face. Evening with dews had overspread the place Almost as gently as the sweet wild rose Her pilgrimage from bud to flower goes. The distant town across the river grey Was strengthening its glimmering display Of invitation, adding ray to ray. Homeward, in silent thought, I went my way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROSE'S DIARY. TO H. S. S. O Friend, O Brother, O Beloved! I fold thy grief around my heart, By love's most prizÃ«d privilege In all thy pain to bear a part. Rest thee, thou Traveller opprest! My fanning sighs shall o'er thee move; My heart, thy rock of shady rest, Pours thee its stream of tearful love. O Friend! O Love! That murmuring song Hath but faint echoes of her past; The sweet full anthem, swelling long, Leaving this silent void at last. A âsilent voidâ? Ah no! Ah no! Clasp fast thy pain, belovÃ«d friend! Its pangs from holiest memories grow Which thou shalt cherish to the end. Our Rose, our gath er'd flower! We weep Slow-falling, pining, fruitless tears, Thinking how fair she bloom'd. We keep Her fragrance to embalm our years. Our own âGioneâ! O to lift Up to her height our earnest eyes, To walk with her in living faith, In simple truth, sublimely wise! Strong, ev'n as she, to bear our woe; Pure, ev'n as she, from taint of ill; So might we feel, and, feeling, know That all her love is with us still. 1850. S. P. ROSE'S DIARY. S. N. R. F. June 20, 1850. âAgain therefore spake Jesus unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.â I. January. I have a little trembling light, which still All tenderly I keep, and ever will. I think it never wholly dies away, But oft it seems as if it could not stay, And I do strive to keep it if I may. Sometimes the wind-gusts push it sore aside; Then closely to my breast my light I hide, And for it make a tent of my two hands; And, though it scarce might on the lamp abide, It soon recovers, and uprightly stands. Sometimes it seems there is no flame at all; I look quite close because it is so small: Then all for sorrow do I weep and sigh; But Some One seems to listen when I cry, And the light burns up, and I know not why. Sometimes I thinkâHow could I live, what do, Without my light?âAnd then,âDoes each of you, Dear friends,â(I think)âa little light have too? But still I fear to speak, and can but sigh,â And it may stay my secret till I die. II. February. To her, my friend, about this secret light I spake to-day: she said she knew the same; I must be thankful, for it was God's flame; For guidance it was meant, and for delight, And, unto all who asked for it, it came. She said it is this light that shows the way To true deeds; that the martyr who adjourns From flames to heavenly house, finds it outburns The pile; and that, it lighting us, we may Rejoin our long-lost loving ones some day. As these her words found entrance at mine ears, Mine eyes grew hot; great thoughts my mind did drown; I seem'd to breathe of heavenly atmospheres;â But when she went away I knelt me down, And all my face was wetted o'er with tears. III. March. How shall I keep this sacred light? How best Preserve it from such influence as assails? Unless I tend it lovingly, it fails; And there is nothing when the blast prevails But the poor shelter of my hands and breast. O God, O Father, hear Thy child who cries! Who would not quench Thy flame, who would not dare To let it dwindle in sinful air; Who does feel how all-precious such a prize, And yet, alas! is feeble and not wise. O hear, dear Father, for Thou know'st the need! Thou know'st what awful height there is in Thee,â How very low I am. O do Thou feed Thy light, that it burn ever, and succeed My life to truest holiness to lead. IV. April. Gladly unto the House of God I go. The private sabbath-fountain, ebbing low, Up-welling will with more refreshment flow; New health of heart, new wealth of thought arise, In worship of the Lord of earth and skies. Here on each reverent face how good to gaze! How loud the silence from their lips that falls! And hark, the place how hush'd, when o'er the walls A solemn, sacred, soften'd echo strays, Born of the voice wherewith the pastor prays! The prayer wherewith our souls at first did bow In stillness, soon we may with voice endow, For lo! the choir hath now begun to bare, Reverent, the limbs of Music, who, till now Hath lain retirÃ«d in the silent air; And now they show that fair form whereunto We with our voice the tender air may mould And fashion till it take resemblance true. O Father! let us now, so singing, strive To be with worship's very soul alive. Let all our hearts with Thy inspirings glow, And make pure thoughts, like flowers, bud and blow Before Thee, O our Saviour! till there go Such sweetness forth as shall in life's rough ways Linger and live about us all our days. V. May An awe-inspiring thing it is to invite The church profess'd of God, that they may see How well we do maintain the heavenly light, How pure, how holy-temper'd we can be, How daily win similitude to Thee. And yet this thing thou callest me to do; And I, a child, am to confess Thy name Among those who confess Thee, and proclaim That I am also Thine; possessing too, As they, the shinings of Thy holy flame. Therefore, O Father! faith to do the task Thou call'st me to; pureness, to show me how Thy Spirit sincerely ever to avow; And true humility, and love, to endow My life with henceforth alway,âthese I ask. And while 'tis just that to profess before Thy servants' faces I should be afraid, O let me, Father! ever dread much more Lest I from that profession retrograde Which to Thyself in secret I have made. VI. June. The day with light its genial self engirds; The trees are glad with fluty voices dear:â âThou art my God!ââWhen I say o'er those words, I see a light beyond the day, and hear Voices far richer than the songs of birds. Mine eyes with happy tears then overswim; The thoughts I have are sweetest that can be; My mind's a cup with love above the brim; Fine incense circles round whate'er I see; In every sound I hear a holy hymn. Thou art my God! Thou, Father, Thou my Friend; My Saviour Thou, the eternal Lord of all! O thought which doth all other thought transcend, Beneath whose stress well may I prostrate fall In love and wonder which should know no end! VII. August. Unless I strive these people dear to bless, I do not love my God. If still I seek No good or joy of theirs, and acquiesce In what makes weak the strong, or wrongs the weak, Myself of God's own love I dispossess. I must begin to live for others now; Some wisely-loving work must now commence. Soon will this sun go down; alas, and how Should I then dare with any confidence A second dawn to look for and avow? Who works not for his fellows starves his soul; His thoughts grow poor and dwindle, and his heart Grudges each beat as misers do a dole; He dies anon, and shall with them have part Who find in death an everlasting goal. VIII. September. Put not on me, O Lord! this work divine, For I am too unworthy, and Thy speech Would be defrauded through such lips as mine. I have not learn'd Thee yet, and shall I teach? O choose some other instrument of Thine! The great, the royal ones, the noble saints, These all are Thine, and they will speak for Thee. No one who undertakes Thy words but faints; Yet, if that man is saintly and sin-free, Through him Thou wilt, O Lord! self-utter'd be. But how shall I say anything, a child, Not fit for such high work,âoh how shall I Say what in speaking must not be defiled? And yet, and yet, if I refuse to try, The light that burns for mine own life will die. IX. October. How noble ought my manners now to be, How white my secret life,âI, who have seen The Lord in His Word's glory! I, who see So vast a mound of love to intervene Between the torrent of my sins and me! I ought to walk now as the angels do, The holy dead, redeem'd by faithful strife From this inferior state; to whom accrue The higher issues of that blessed life That hath with Thee undying interview. I ought to be as holy-white as they, As ardent toward my Lord:âalas! instead, Upon the very path my Lord doth tread To meet my soul, I sink down, sooth to say, On the road-side almost a castaway. Up, up, my soul! Awake, and use thy goad! I lose for ever the divine abode If in this poor estate I thus abide: The ground I stand on now will soon subside, And be by ocean fathomless o'erflow'd. X. November. What mean these slow returns of love; these days Of wither'd prayer; of dead unflowering praise? These hands of twilight laid on me to keep Dusk veils on holy vision? This most deep, Most eyelid-heavy, lamentable sleep? Lo, time is precious as it was before; As sinful, sin; my goal as unattain'd; And yet I drowse, and dream, and am not pain'd At God far off as ever heretofore,â At sin as flagrant as of old, or more. Dear Lord, what can I do? I come to Thee: I have none other helper. Thou art free To save me, or to kill. But I appeal To Thine own love which will not elsewise deal Than prove Thyself my help, Thy will my weal. Wake, wake me, God of love! and let Thy fire Loosen these icicles and make them drop And run into warm tears; for I aspire To hold Thee faster, dearer, warmer, nigher, And love and serve Thee henceforth without stop. XI. December. O Father! I have sinn'd against Thee,âdone The thing I thought I never more should do. My days were set before me, light all through, But I have made them dark, it is too true, And drawn dense clouds between me and my Sun. Forgive me not, for grievous is my sin; Yea, very deep and dark. Alas! I see Such blackness in it, that I may not be Forgiven of myself,âhow then of Thee?â Vile, vile without; black, utter black within. If my shut eyes should dare their lids to part, I know how they must quail beneath the blaze Of Thy love's greatness. No: I dare not raise One prayer to look aloft, lest I should gaze On such forgiveness as would break my heart. XII. January. I said, âThese trivial rules I cannot see Why any longer they should cumber me.â So left I them behind, and for awhile The change was pleasant and did me beguile To dance, to sing of liberty, and smile. But presently my light went dim, my head Grew dull and heavy, and my heart was lead; And, if I moved at all, it was to go Back to the thickets and the places low Which thorns and cross-leaved nettles over-grow. At last I reassumed my rules with pain, (I thank Thee, Lord!) and soon grew well again. But ever, if I leave those helps behind, My heart beats colder, and my head, I find, Grows dull and heavy, and mine eyes are blind. Sometimes I think, âWhat can a thing so small Matter to eye or head or heart at all?â But then I answer, âWhat is that to me?â And truly, Father! it is good there be Reasons in reasons only known to Thee. XIII. March. Take what ye will, ye men who boldly nod, And blindly, opposite the Lord of all; Take from me what ye will, the loss is small, With still a Father upon Whom to call. Take what ye will but Him. Leave me my God. And they must leave Thee, Father! None can kill Thy living splendours. Let them think to shake The sky as 'twere a sheet, until they make The sun to fall thereof, they cannot take My Sun away from me, do what they will. They cannot rob me of my God. I hold My Friend with such a hand as will not sprain Though myriads counter-strive with might and main. O daring men, Him ye ignore in vain: Whom ye deny, mine arms of love enfold. XIV. July. The Pearl, Rev. xxi. 21. my Lord's gate-jewel bright and fair, My charm against deceit, against despair! It makes me glad as often as I gaze, Gives me true counsel in the entrance-ways, And sheds bright light and comfort on my days.â Had I but lost this vision, even although My life might still to some appear as sound And vivid as before, alas! I know By them who truly see I should be found Lying that instant dead upon the ground. Sometimes I gaze upon it, and it makes Me shake with its rebuke. Less awful breaks The streaming glory of the morning-red. In sultry skies the glowings are less dread Of lightnings waiting in their gathering lakes. XV. September. My mind was ruffled with small cares to-day, And I said hasty words, and did not keep Long-suffering patience well; and now how deep My sorrow for this sin! In vain I weep For foolish words I never can unsay. Yet not in vain, oh surely not in vain! This trouble must compel me to take heed; And surely I shall learn how much I need Thy constant strength mine own to help indeed, And all my thought to patience to constrain. Yes, I shall learn at length, though I neglect Day after day to use my help from Thee. O aid me that I alway recollect Thy gentle-heartedness; and O correct Whatever else of sin Thou seest in me! XVI. November. Each day a page is of my being's book, And what I do is what I write therein; And often do I make sad blots of sin; And seldom proves the writing quite akin To what my heart beforehand undertook. Daily I turn a fresh leaf, and renew My hope of now at last a nobler page; But presently in something I engage That looks but poorly on a calm review, And leaves my future a mean heritage. So leaf on leaf, once clean, is turn'd and gone, And the dark spots show through, and I grow sad, And blush, and frown, and sigh. And, if I had A million pages yet to write upon, Perhaps the millionth would be just as bad. What shall I do? Some new leaves, even yet, May be before me. And perhaps I may Write, even yet, some not ignoble day. Alas! I do not know;âI cannot say.â What is it to feel living?âI forget. XVII. January. Cut off from Thee I am. Sin is the knife. Yet must I join Thee, though with grief and strife. Oh let me live with Thee,âlive, live with Thee! How else, Lord! can I live, unless more free Thy truth, Thy love, Thy life, flow on through me? Cries with this prayer my heart's tongue without rest, God's great name being on it. This hath drest Mine eyes full oft in veils that swell and drip; This oft hath weigh'd a burden on my lip, And lifted for my Lord my sighing breast. Oh let me live with Thee,âlive, live with Thee! How else, Lord! can I live, unless more free Thy truth, Thy love, Thy life, flow on through me? I am cut off from Thee. Sin is the knife. Yet will I join Thee, though through grief and strife. XVIII. February. Late on me, weeping, did this whisper fall:â âDear child, there is no need to weep at all. Why go about to grieve and to despair? Why weep now through thy future's eyes, and bear Vainly to-day to-morrow's load of care? âMine is thy welfare. Ev'n the storms fulfil, On those who love Me, none but My decrees. Lightning shall not strike thee against My will; And I, thy Lord, can save thee when I please From quaking earth and the devouring seas. âWhy be so dull, so slow to understand? The more thou trustest Me, the more can flow My love, and thou, a jewel in My hand, Shalt richer be; whence thou canst never go So softly slipping, but that I shall know. âIf thou should'st seem to slip,âif griefs and pains And death assail,âfor thee there yet remains My love, which lets them, and which surely will Thee reinstate where thou a place shalt fill Inviolate, for ever steadfast still.â âFather!â (I said) âI do accept Thy word. To perfect trust in Thee now am I stirr'd By the dear gracious saying I have heard.â And, having said this, fell a peace so deep Into my heart, what could I do but weep? XIX. March. I must behold Him nearer than I do; Far truer vision of my Lord achieve; So live, as never more His heart to grieve; So open lie as largely to receive The Lord at every lustrous avenue, And reach Him much more closely than I do: Must on His Word more deeply reverent gaze; More fully breathe His life, which trembleth through My being when before me He displays His love engirt by that rebuking blaze That awes the more at every interview, Yet leaves a blessing holy and most sweet But now my desolate life is incomplete. I must in God mine old delight renew; I must behold Him nearer than I do. XX. April. My mind is towards the dwellings of my Lord, Whereto the faithful joyfully repair To offer in devout, divine accord Their gifts to Him Who gave them,âthe All-fair; Their prayers to the Prayer-hearer Who is there. They join their voices in what beauteous strains! In them, Himself revealing, the Most High, How strong, how sweet intensity attains! How large above them, there, His vivid eye! How deep, how dear, the comfort that He deigns! There, inward music glorifies the hour; There, in glad cheer they sit, and, sitting, sing, And, singing, inly rise, and, rising, tower Above the summit of each selfish thing, Into the Saviour's Wisdom, Love, and Power. Love, Wisdom, Power, supreme, ineffable! The Way, the Truth, the Life, for ever blest! Yea, with His saints, so gather'd, it is well, When His acceptance them doth circumvest, And they within His awful secret dwell. XXI. May. How beautiful it is to be alive! To wake each morn as if the Maker's grace Did us afresh from nothingness derive That we might sing âHow happy is our case! How beautiful it is to be alive!â To read in God's great Book, until we feel Love for the love that gave it; then to kneel Close unto Him Whose truth our souls will shrive, While every moment's joy doth more reveal How beautiful it is to be alive. Rather to go without what might increase Our worldly standing, than our souls deprive Of frequent speech with God, or than to cease To feel, through having wasted health or peace, How beautiful it is to be alive. Not to forget, when pain and grief draw nigh, Into the ocean of time past to dive For memories of God's mercies, or to try To bear all sweetly, hoping still to cry âHow beautiful it is to be alive!â Thus ever towards man's height of nobleness Strive still some new progression to contrive; Till, just as any other friend's, we press Death's hand; and, having died, feel none the less How beautiful it is to be alive. XXII. June. Prayer is the world-plant's blossom, the bright flower, A higher purpose of the stem and leaves;â Or call it the church-spire, whose top receives Such lightning calm as comforts, not aggrieves, And with it brings the fructifying shower. Prayer is the hand that catcheth hold on peace;â Nay, 'tis the very heart of nobleness Whose pulses are the measure of the stress Wherewith He doth us, we do Him, possess: If these should fail, all our true life would cease. Who live in prayer a friend shall never miss; If we should slip, a timely staff and kind Placed in our grasp by hands unseen shall find; Sometimes upon our foreheads a soft kiss, And arms cast round us gently from behind. XXIII. July. How beautiful our lives may be, how bright In privilege, how fruitful of delight! For we of love have endless revenue; And, if we grieve, 'tis not as infants do That wake and find no mother in the night. They put their little hands about, and weep Because they find mere air, or but the bed Whereon they lie; but we may rest, instead, For ever on His bosom, Who doth keep Our lives alike safe, when we wake, and sleep. And lo! all round us gleam the angelic bands, Swift messengers of Providence all-wise, With frowning brows, perhaps, for their disguise, But with what springs of love within the eyes, And what strong rescue hidden in the hands! And our lives may in glory move along, First, holy-white, and then with goodness fair For our dear Lord to see;âthe keenest thong Of all that whips us, welcome; and the air Our spirits breathe, self-shaped into a song. XXIV. August. A little lowly gate;âthrough this we go Forth into truth divine with love ablaze; Therein He leads us on through wondrous ways Ineffable. Whatever spirit prays, That low gate entering, is exalted so. Out in the garden of the Word, that wide Glad paradise, we are borne on by prayer; There do we breathe air high and glorified, And, He updrawing us, attain the fair Ascending terraces, and prosper there. O prosperous above all measure, those His good and faithful servants, self-abhorr d, Who enter in the joy of their dear Lord,â Joy that in others' welfare centres, grows In others' gain, in others' joy o'erflows. In heaven, to rise, is to augment the store Of power to enrich the poorest, and defend The weakest, through the widest, nearest door. How else could Christ's redeem'd endure to ascend From height to happier height for evermore?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FUNEREAL WREATHS. EDWARD BROTHERTON. Well may they fallâthese tears; and yet, dear Friend, Long mourning years will not suffice to feel The fulness of our loss, nor to the end Its bitterness reveal. For thine was not a mind of vulgar mould; Thy purpose never needed mask or hood; But always for the Right thy heart was bold, And steadfast for the Good. God gave to thee looks kind and dignified, Gave wisdom's loving eyes and generous brow. Not oft I've known, than thine, a heart more wide,â A nobler man, than thou. What courteous charities adorn'd thy hand! Christ was thy Master, and thou didst rejoice To woo men to His Wedding; didst command With a most kindly voice. Even wilful error could not hate the sound, Though writhing at the truth, of thy appealing,â Truth clad in words of earnestness profound, And full of solemn feeling;â Because so tender in its sternest mood, Thy manner was; so apt in loving meetness; So gracious in its mastery; so good And wholesome in its sweetness. We, who had known thee long, and recognised That only thy great meekness thee detain'd From general honour,âthee whom we so prized With reverence unfeign'd;â How glad were we when thou the bonds didst break Of diffidence, thy privacy off cast, And as a leader of the people take Thy rightful place at last! Now, high and blissful is thy heaven, we know; But thy true heart, was it not always set On service, not on pleasure? And earth's woe Sorely requires thee yet. Why might not Heaven still spare thee to our need? For thee, with this sad earth can heaven compare? There are no orphans' hearts that blindly bleed, No ragged children there. Alas, poor starving minds that want in vain! Now thou art gone, who will regard their need? So feel? So strive? So toil with might and main? With such persist ence plead? Yet 'tis no mystery why thou didst die: Surely from earth thou hadst not been set free But that for some still larger work on high The Lord had need of thee; 'Tis for some ministry of loving skill, Some heaven-augmenting function wide and deep, Fit just for thee as for none else to fill, That we are left to weep. J. B. The church sometimes gives heaven men Of whom with cause heaven might complain That, though it gets accession then, 'Tis more a getting than a gain. But now a boon the church imparts; Heaven with new riches we endow; One after their own loving hearts To the good angels give we now. Not without grief we let him pass; We are not yet, as angels, good; To heaven we give what we, alas! Would have kept from it if we could. For he we mourn was one of those Whose presence of itself affords Heart-music that in silence flows, And comforts more than many words. His goodness we all have by heart:â I've known him by a mourner stand And most unsought-for help impart By the mere pressure of a hand,â A hand that, round the mourner's put In silence, yet as much hath done As though 'twere not one only, but The hand of every friend in one. His trustful heart laid loving stress On God's love, howsoever tried, And even in most sore distress Was sure the Lord would still provide; And always his life's fact made clear What his life's theory express'd, That in the end it will appear That all is ever for the best. He had his griefs, like other men; But to God's will could softly bow, And, smiling, say, âHeaven is not then And there, but heaven is here and now. A happy man whose heart would feel And head would think for those around; Ready to find out ills to heal, As well as heal the ills he found. Still towards our Father he ascends; Still towards our God aspires his way, Where she, his dearest, and their friends Angelic, throng the gates of day. To these how thankless and how wrong Our sorrow for his loss appears! âNay, sing,â they cry, âa grateful song That ye have had him all these years. âNow more than ever yours indeed, From him more grandly than before Shall heavenly influences proceed, To be your blessing evermore.â October, 1876. B. M. B. What, gone? Our fair young neighbour? It cannot, cannot be true!â But how will the mother bear it? And what will the father do? Alas, for the hearts sore wounded, For the lives so much undone! Alas for their home, their hearth, their earth, Alas for their moon and sun! For the sky will fill again with light, But not as it fill'd before; The hearth-fire crackling may be bright, But how can it warm them more? Weary, old earth will look, and worn, And home some alien scene Planted with many a keen heart-thorn Wherever her hand hath been,â Planted with thorn by loving hands That only planted flowers; But love-flowers turn to roots of pain When wash'd by the death-grief's showers. Yet can it be, Fair Neighbour,â Gone, with the sweet young face, The eyes so bright with kindly light, And the form so gentle with grace? The mouth that sang so sweetly As the music moved along? The voice that seem'd in common speech Almost as pleasant as song? Gone to the land so silent, The home hid deep in the sky, Whereto our questioning hearts look up, But never for reply? Alas, alas! Fair Neighbour, We had not thought to stay So long on earth to outlive thy birth Into the heavens gay. And yet, if we were wiser, We should deeply thankful be That the heaven abiding our coming Is henceforth the richer with thee; For when it opens around us, And we breathe its welcoming air, It will take us in with a happier smile For thy sweet presence there. February, 1879. H. P. Love, broken-hearted, cried:â âWhy hath this poet died? Why should a harp, just tuned and taught to play, Be given no concert-day, But idly broken up and cast away?â Doth some Child-god complete Here His poor music-toys, To please Himself a moment with their noise, Then swell the piteous pile beneath His feet?â âOh, shame!â the Angels said; âBut have you never read How blessÃ«d, yea How blessÃ«d, they Who in the Lord are dead? They from their labours rest, And their works follow them, in heavenly state, To new achievements wonderful and great, Where the best pow'rs their souls possess'd, Toiling no more. work free, spontaneous, and blest. âOh, let your thoughts be lifted on our wings! What seem'd your own dear harp, whose tender strings You saw destroy'd ev'n in your sad embrace, Was but the covering case Of the true harp and music's real things. What if our songful companies, to praise The Ancient One of Days, Had need now, for their exquisite content, Of one more instrument? Deem you it strange that His permission went With our keen search around For even the very best that might be found? Far above earthly thoughts and ways, Your son shall help us, through the eternal days, To sing of Love the omnipotence and praise. So be you of good cheer; Let no more tears be shed; Restrain your sobbings, that your hearts may hear Him singing, in our choirs, glad, loud and clear, How great and marvellous His ways Who said,â âWrite, BlessÃ«d are the dead.ââ April, 1884.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GLEANINGS. TO MARY SOPHIA SUTTON. If any it pleases to see Past work of thy poet, 'Tis wholly from thee and to thee They have and they owe it; Hadst thou not its author and it So tenderly cherish'd, It would in its burial-pit Have quietly perish'd. And now that the summer is o'er, And the autumn is ending, I through the old garden once more My way have been wending, To cull, in the mist and the cold And the wet and the waning, Whatever of new or of old Might still be remaining. Well knowing towards all that is mine Thy generous leanings, I boldly denominate thine These ultimate gleanings; And gladly I bring unto thee, (Strong love's weak expression,) This handful of flowers to be Thy special possession. Thou'lt prize them no less though they tell That winter is coming; Yet let them foreshadow as well Our heavenly homing; The winter will nip and will sting And blacken and harden, But in the soon-following Spring We'll have a new garden. November, 1885. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that hath been made.â A HYMN OF CREATION. I. God! The Alone, the Infinite, the Whole! Star-dust condenses, suns burn, planets roll From Thy Word's fountain, O Creator sole! All that Thou makest, art Thou; and yet far More high, deep, wide, than all creations are. Thou Who of all things the Inventor art, Whether of spirit-powers we speak, apart From things material, or of things that be Subjected to those powers,âthe company Of rolling orbs throughout immensity:â Thou by Whom, ere our system's flow of things, Their fatherly first beat Time in his wings Retain'd; where, scarcely breathing, he did stand Still, eager, tremulous, till the first sand Might drop down in the hour-glass in his hand:â Thou, at whose Voice Space, like a sleep, was broke, To carry in her arms when she awoke Another orb, Thy offspring; that her breast And mother-arms might foster and invest Our sun, one babe the more to be caress'd:â Thou by whose Word that sun, infill'd with fire By the eternal sun, mother and sire Became, and brought at length to blazing birth, And caused to roll in its own orbit's girth, Each moonless or moon-lighted planet-earth:â Thou, Who with bursting fires and various flow Of winds above, and floods and seas below, With masses crystalline, and metal-vein, And ooze, and sediment, and heaps immane, Layest the bases strong for heart and brain;â Who dost lift up the continents, and spread For every sea its deep, its shifting bed For every stream; whose operant hand defines The bearings of all trends and serpentines, And levels of all risings and inclines:â Who chillest flowing waves to icy rock, And rains to snow and hail, and dost unlock And set all free again with fervent air; Who all the mineral creatures dost endow With man-foreseeing uses:âLo, we bow! II. God! Whose incessant hand still weaves a robe Of verdure and of glory for the globe; Adding cells living to the living cell, Until to aspects multiform they swell, With order'd parts, symmetric, parallel; Taking possession wide with leafy hands And branches for their arms; about the lands In green profuseness, and in flowers the while Thy thought inscribing in symbolic style Gorgeous on every continent and isle:â Yea, Thine! And none the less because outwrought By instruments subservient to Thy thought; Quick honey-seeking wingÃ«d things that fly From flower to flower, strange pollen to supply, And make the future all the past outvie;â Thine, still, the flowers; in Thy designs array'd; Their insects, too, are Thine; them hast Thou made, Thy purposes to struggle toward, and aid;â In all are shown the wonders of Thy lore Creative:âThee, Great Maker, we adore! III. O God, Who, working now in subtler moods Within the cells where coming sentience broods, Makest the earth with faunal growths abound In myriad moving forms of being, found In homes of air, of water, and of ground;â Artist profound of countless lives that look And feel all round us, for whom every nook Of Nature hastens to provide new nests, Fired by Thy liberal heart, which manifests So grand a yearning for increase of guests;â From Whose fount flow all various things that thrive On feet or wings, or, watery, float and dive;â For whose progressive change Thou dost contrive Needs that them force, by slow but sure degrees, New strange developments to snatch and seize;â Who all their motions movest in, and art Of their sensations the invisible heart;â Who kindlest passions swift, hot, cold, or slow, Mothers of thought and gesture:âThee to know We seek, and to adore Thee, bending low! IV. God! by Whose lives in nostrils breathed, our race Is lift above its animal being-base Unto a noble heritage and place,â A race of higher power and renown, All Nature's monarch, all Creation's crown;â Thou, Who instillest thought that weighs the spheres And dives in problem-seas there to enmesh Whatever subtly-wandering thing appears, And mak'st the books be written o'er afresh With vast increases through advancing years;â Who with oar, sail, steam, rail, and throbbing wire Dwindlest the earth to bring the peoples nigher, That far-off lands may mutual aid arrange, That east with west may commune and exchange, And north to south be helpful, and not strange;â Beauteous Inspirer of each high attempt In form, sound, colour, language, to protract Ãsthetic influences death-exempt, That whoso sees or hears may re-enact In dreams poetic what the artist dreamt;â Whose sea of sacred light divine includes All souls, solicits all, and watches still For entrance, and with ceaseless patience broods, And is aggrieved unless it may infill Each helpless heart with power to do Thy will;â Who art the true light, clearly or darkly seen, That lights us all the womb and grave between, Illumining the clouds that intervene Betwixt us and thy Spirit-sun above, And glowing brightest when we pray and love;â Who beam'st forth in the noble, sweet surprise That streams, forgiving, from the tearful eyes Of injured gentleness; and hast a place In sacred gleams where shines the martyr's face, In tender smiles where holy hearts embrace;â Whose will it is that we severely hate And wrestle with the lusts that suffocate Thy Spirit in our hearts, and slowly gain At length the utter victory, and reign With Thee triumphant over sin and pain;â Dost Thou not weep in all our righteous tears? Joyest Thou not in our true joys? Thy years Are they not mission'd that they shall not cease To its just stature Thy great masterpiece, The grand organic manhood, to increase? Yea, Father, even so! And still Thy love Strives ever to attract our hearts above To Thee and to Thy high angelic throne;â And yet to basest levels we how prone, And deaf to all Thy Word's appealing tone! But now we kneel before Thee, and we sayâ Prayer lived in, lived out, this th' appointed way; O help us then to live e'en as we pray, Humbly, and taught of God, and striving still To be obedient to Thy holy will;â Thence rising to the sure unfailing trust; The good deeds done, no more because we must, But that we love to do them;âsevenfold peace All other peace, all ecstasy above;â Light ever-growing;âever-largening love. A NEW YEAR'S GIFT. The old year, loath, disappears In wind and in rain, With passionate gusts and with tears Protesting in vain. The new year, eager, receives The greetings of peace; And oh may its morns and its eves Thy blessings increase! If I pray thee a prayer, believe it A service of love; If I give thee a gift, receive it Its worth far above; I love thee much more than with prayer Or gift I can speak, Or hand within hand, or with lips, Love, Aglow on thy cheek. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. All spiritual questions yet unsolved Are ask'd by their own answers, which, concealed At first, are sure at last to be revealed; Bills safe, or soon or later, to come due; Safe at the right time to be honoured too;â For this great universe is not a nest Of boxes within boxes, to be forced Lid after lid, until the last and least Rewards the searcher with, forsooth, at best An empty rhyme, or an insulting jest. Shall it be thought that the great Lord o' th' world Hath twisted up its fibres into curled Notes of interrogation, whose bent backs Man shall not straighten, but must still let stand Crooked and querying still on every hand? Let us not cast such stone at our Creator, Nor doubt that He will prove full Revelator:â The world ignores man with her scornful eye; âO Sphinx!â he falters; but she with the cry âO Ådipus!â must finally reply. The promised Cubic City, full of light, E'en now descending from God's heavenly height, Has touched the earth. O happy they whose right It is to find a path that penetrates Within its twelvefold angel-guarded gates! But sorrow for the nations, who, with creed Ill understood, or shattered, darkly stray, And in wastes godless, or false-godded, bleed! Be gentle with them, teachers, who essay To show them than their own a better way. And oh be ours indeed the better way! Be ours the truest, worthiest thoughts of Thee, Thoughts that behold, not dream; adore, not play; Sincere and brave, large and sublimely free, Yet led not by ourselves, O Lord, but Thee! THE EARTH DEFACED. How wonderful, how beautiful, the world! At its continual creation, Thou, O Lord, art present Maker;âfashioned thus Because it is a dwelling-place to be Of them who shall be dwelling-place for Thee. Thou, Father, build'st this palace for Thy child; A surface river-marbled, flower-emboss'd, Scribed with old-time inscriptions in its floor; Close-clustered trees for its arched columns tall, And sun, and moon, and stars, high over all. 'Tis we who shear the lustre from the sun, And glory from the flowers. Wigwams of mud We build within thy lofty Parthenon, Between the noble pillars, and deface With our mean uses the majestic place. The robes Thou giv'st of very cloth of heaven We tear to shreds wherewith to bind our limbs In livid pressures; then to those same bonds We, self-tied, point; to Thee appeal for ease, And cry, âO God! why didst Thou send us these?â Forth from its marvellous founts the air, new-made, Creeps glad, with health, to the abodes of men; We shut our doors in the kind creature's face, And offer incense of deflowered breathâ Invoking-incenseâunto Pain and Death. The good soul of the trees and flowers we warn Off from our homes, and will not have her arm Cast kindly round us; but, close crowding, stand, Lest, leaving room amongst us, we begin Haply to let our gentle lover in: And though to her, indeed, our very frames Their being owe, for flowers possess their kin In our own flesh, we hate her even there, And make our homes dark, that she may not thrive E'en in our bodies which she keeps alive. THE BATTLE OF GOD. Ah, what a day was that! A sweeter ne'er Oped wonderingly its gentle eyelids mild On the warm breast of any nursing year. As looks and smiles a mother on her child, So Nature on that young morn look'd and smiled. She wrapp'd it in a robe of fleeciest sky; Trimm'd it afresh those lamps the poet sees Burn every flower in odours secretly; Of each bloom-breathing wind she had, did seize The richest moments; then said, âDear, take these!â On that same day magnifical, great joy Lay landscape-like a certain man before, To whom it seemed there could be no employ Awaited or conceived, save only o'er Wide wilds of bliss to wander evermore. Then in the chamber of his heart there came A whisper of the Voice that still will bless;â A naming of the everlasting Name;â A Presence working the glad heart to impress, And warm its each beat into thankfulness;â A sense as when a babe, half-sleeping, lies, And with a gradual dawning comes aware,â Less by the actual warrant of the eyes, Than by the consciousness of tenderest care,â Of presence of its watchful mother there. And then he heard a solemn, priest-like sound, Given in his inner spirit, to convey A sense of ceasing, perfect and profound,â As if all things around had paused, to say âHere endeth the first lesson. Let us pray!â And soon a sob, a sinking, and a sigh, A trance, a breathless sleep with open eye; And then a vision stretching heaven-high, Of loves that kneel and sing, and thoughts that thank, Incarnate all, like angels rank o'er rank. Out of which heavenly trance ere long he strayed Where lo! with flowery streets, umbrageous greens, And palaces, old earth was happy made; Happy all over with such perfect scenes As poet, heaven on earth foreseeing, means;â O blessÃ«d vision of old earth new-made; The law divine unquestioned and obeyed; Trod down for ever all things that degrade; All life by art and poetry refined; And God-love, man-love, blessing all mankind! Was this mere idle dream,âas when, in car Pendent from earth, in space's solar sea, With our great globe balloon-wise over me, I seem'd to float once, voyaging afar Past moon and planet, nebula and star? Or was that better earth an orb that goes In company with our earth, undescried, As in dead night a traveller walks and knows Naught of the angel who upon that wide And desolate heath moves, silent, by his side? Or was this the great vision that still waits To enter as a fact earth's opening gates;â A fact which all the prophets true foretell;â An earth where Christ as King and Lord shall dwell, In world where all is new, and all is well? So strive, so reign, Almighty Lord of all! So greatly win Thy planet-victory! So gloriously what baffleth bring in thrall! So strongly work, earth's lasting jubilee With gladness and with singing to install! And man may work with the great God! Yea, ours This privilegeâall others how beyond!â To tend the great Man-root until it flowers; To scorn with godly laughter when despond Tamely before a hoary hindrance cowers; Effectually the planet to subdue, And break old savagehood in claw and tusk; That noble end to trust in and pursue Which under Nature's half-expressive husk Lies ever to the base concealed from view; To draw our fellows up, as with a cord Of love, unto their high appointed place; Till from our state barbaric and abhorred We do arise unto a royal race, Becoming blessÃ«d children of the Lord. THE BEST OF IT. The seasons swiftly come and go, And still we two remain, Standing amid the changeful flow Of joy and pain. The joy we claim; the pain, not small, We dimly understand; But oh, thank God, we live through all Still hand in hand! THE SIGHT OF GOD The pearl, the amethyst, the gold, which shone The stately creature's breast so bright upon, No brilliance lent to her; for she was decked, I saw, to far more glorious effect In that life-light she seem'd half to reflect, Half radiate, from her presence; the soft flow Of breath, and beat of vital pulse, the show Of growth unflawed, symmetric, and the glow Of health resplendent, which I must have been Most dull, if them unthankful I had seen. But then, with what intenser wonder-gaze I looked upon her face, beheld the blaze Of light intelligent, observed the streak And flush of fresh emotion on her cheek, And saw her soul in every movement speak! The more I looked, the more and more amazed The marvel made me whereupon I gazed; But when I marked the love of God arise In prayer and pureness in her mien and eyes, And in her hands His faithful charities, Then said I: âLord! Though I, 'mongst atheists driven, Walked through their death-shade vale, Thy staff and rod Would me console, since here is Thine abode; This is none other than a house of God; This is indeed a very gate of heaven!â And yet what can the outward vision see But symbols mere, which far below Him fall? Only in His Divine Humanity, High over every creature, are we free To see in very truth the Lord of all. RALPH WALDO EMERSON. As robe majestic down a statue flows, So noble thought down Emerson. Withal, Such sweetness went, you even might suppose, Spite of that bearing dignified and tall, A woman's gentle heart beat under all; For while no prayers his constancy could shake, No storm avail his spirit's barque to make From anchor of his settled purpose break, His every action could not but confess The tempering of ingrainÃ«d tenderness. Yet, while our young souls loved him, 'twas agreed Amongst us that this man, though ever apt For kind deed, and in self so little wrapped, Almost too high for love was; had indeed Of no man's love or admiration need. And yet he, loving, liked to be beloved; And if at times it might appear he moved Austerely calm and cold, that was because Grand hearts may not transcend their nature's laws Either to beat more quickly or to pause. There was the genial waiting on his friend That friendship loves to feel. Absence would send As much pain, as much pleasure presence lend To him as one could wish; but the control Was over all of a self-mastered soul. Therefore in our brief intercourse was mixed, With strangeness, intimacy; and a feud There came our awe and confidence betwixt; And moods of his there were that must be viewed Like gated ways where none might dare intrude. One foolish man, by his sweet mien betrayed, An undue freedom took. Swift silence played Like lambent lightning round, and on us fell Awe of the great majestic soul that well Knew, still or speaking, how to be obeyed. So have I seen in festive season go A summer barque, laugh-lightened, 'neath the flow Of waving flags, the while, in their sweet pride, On deck the youths and maidens gaily glide With motions by sweet music justified. Sudden, o'er sunken rock, harsh grates the keel; From every mouth the merry laughter dies; The founts of music freeze; astonished eyes Gaze wide on eyes astonished; and all feel The fears proud hearts indignantly conceal. But, no new shock confirming what each dreads, Again the music melts and flows; its threads The dance reweaves; over each mouth there spreads The young vermilion laughter; and once more The fluttering flags wave wind-filled as before. 1849. THE REASON OF IT. Ah why, why should the good so often lean On arms which beats no worthy heart between? And why should noble hearts so oft be seen In loneliness and ageing anguish keen For want of the sweet home that should have been? And souls unselfish, who have gladly done The generous deeds that have for others won New scope and happier life beneath the sun, Why must they, reaping, bind into their sheaf The night-shades and the hebenon of grief? It is because, let man do what he will, Joy-light requires its sorrow-shadow still;â It is because away God will not throw His labour, letting His dear children go Robb'd of the needful discipline of woe;â It is because of this world's good th' excess, Ill helping our eternal blessedness, Is a less worthy God-gift than distress;â It is because 'tis not well, in His ken, That we be happy, until we be Men. THE BRAGGART MOON. The Moon moved proud the stars among, And spake aloud with scornful tongue: âStars! minions! rushlights of the sky! Mean, ineffectual, worthless fry! Mere drops of waste ungathered light! Gilt buttons on the coat of night! My plagiarists,âmoon-copyists small! See how I trample o'er you all. âI, how magnificent I shine! What splendours and what glory mine! Mark, of what genius possessed, I grandly march from east to west, And pour o'er farm and town and tower My many-sided beams of power. Look and despair, ye paltry chits! Were I divided into bits, My fragments scattered o'er the blue Would all be stars as good as you.â Did any of the stars reply To this poor braggart of the sky? With lofty joy I saw them keep A silence strenuously deep. They heeded not the scornful tongue; But each, his family among, On his dark planet-children glowed, And in the God-appointed road, With faithful heart and watchful eye, Led on his darlings through the sky. It pleased the Lord our God that soon There came a change across the Moon; Like pain we inly strive to hide, There's blackness gnawing at her side, Until, with anguish and affright, She dwindles to a strip of light, For o'er her face earth's shadow slips A veil of humbling and eclipse. Scorn of the stars deserts her eye; Her tears are dropped about the sky. So weeps the poor Moon, sunk in ruth; Then, suddenly, she sees the truth; Sees that the light whereof she'd grown So proud, was nothing of her own, And that her splendour wholly came From the God-given solar flame. O Lord! if I, self-confident, Should claim as mine what Thou hast lent, Or ever, penetrate with pride, Should be disposed to swerve aside To sign my own certificate As being good, or wise, or great, Command this braggart Moon to rise That moment in my spirit's skies, And light me up, a thing forlorn, Meet object for her withering scorn. âTHAT THY WAY MAY BE KNOWN UPON EARTH; THY SAVING HEALTH AMONG ALL NATIONS.â When spring through thrush and cuckoo cries, The root that in some cavern lies, To cold and darkness thrall, But dimly hears her call. With sick shoots, pallid, piteous hopes, Wan, idiot fingers, how it gropes; Lost for defect of light, A scandal to the sight! Such are the souls that live untaught, Unlit of spiritual thought;â Poor sickly growths that shame E'en vegetation's name. What! suffer human minds to dwell Thus dark in ignorance's cell? O give to them the bright Shingings of heavenly light! Of truth divine all should be heirs; Her pathways should be thoroughfares Free as the woodland wild To every human child. Whatever of God's truth is known Common as grass-seed should be sown; O stint not; let it fall Free, free, for all, for all! THE CROCUS. Oh no, take not the Crocus To be your symbol-flower, For love that is too passionate Will soon itself devour. The crocus's gold trumpets Soon burst, and, in dismay, Split up with love's intenseness, In yellow flames decay. AN UNSENT FAREWELL. Castle built in Spain, At some lover's cost;â Seek for key in vain;â Key is lost. Though you chide for all I do, Yet am I in love with you. Though you bid me to forget, I shall love youâlove you yet. Though you trod upon my heart, That the blood did gush and start, I should answer, death until, I forgive and love you still. To forget? No; dream it not. I by you shall be forgot; You by me, howe'er you plan, Never, never, never can. Think you, minds with love that tremble Wax or paper do resemble? After various fashions fold? Take a shape from every mould? No; my soul did once reply To the impress of a die; Thenceforth never could it own Any print save yours alone. God forbid, indeed, indeed, You from hurt like mine should bleed, With the true love of your soul Drained into a broken bowl! Or that, weighed in such false scale As wherein my love did fail, Other's should with you succeed, God forbid, indeed, indeed! Was it well thus, in the trough Of grief's sea to cast me off? Bid me trust to some chance reef? Leave me weltering in my grief? Yet this by-you-caused distress Cannot make me love you less;â Noble, sure, the deed you do, Seeing it is done by you. So my high-esteeming breaks Every bar your coolness makes, And, whatever way you move, Still I honour, still I love. Yet, since grief to me appears Worse in your than in my tears, (For your sorrow mine must make Twofold sorrow for your sake,) Therefore nor in word nor mien Henceforth shall my love be seen, Nor with whatsoe'er I do Will I ever trouble you;â Ever gaze where I adore, Where your face with smiles runs o'er; Seek to quaff their generous wine, Or to mix your soul with mine;â No, I will not; nor yet seek One poor friend-thought to bespeak; I shall gaze where I adore Never, never, never more. So I go my way unblest, With a heart whose wild unrestâ Never may its secret tell;â Ah, my dear, farewell, farewell! Fare you well! And be there said God's best blessings o'er your head;â Blessings of the heavenly steep And the under-couching deep; Blessings of the fruitful bough, By the well-side prospering now; (Ne'er could I have spoken thus But for Him who died for us!)â Blessings of the breasts,âah me!â Child-encradling arm and knee;â All earth's bliss that can be given, Not imperilling your heaven;â Bliss to be still yours, my dear, Wheresoe'er, with whomsoe'er; Plenteous basket, bounteous store, Yours, and theirs, for evermore. As for me, I stiffen still An unconquerable will; To despair no inch shall give; Hating life, go on to live. Some day will God's reasons tell; Some day He will break the spell That has turned His universe Glorious, to His creature's curse. Though it cannot be conceived, Yet it stands to be believed; Breaking heart, so grief-beset, God will bind, will heal it yet. How, I cannot comprehend, But, in some way, in the end, He His miracle will give;â God will teach me how to live. LOVE'S FREEMASONRY. Written, as I think, In some secret ink; Yet the meaning, found, Will prove good and sound. âAh, if to know the sign she fail,â He said, âWoe, woe!â and he grew pale. The sign was made; but not a trace Of knowing was upon her face. As if death's mouth, the grave, had spoke, His blood its law of flowing broke, And he felt twist in every vein, Snake-like, a nerve of swollen pain. There wrestled he, standing apart To force it back unto the heart, If haply to a running flood It might dissolve, of living blood. O life in death and death in life! O torturing, damn'd, yet conquering strife! For yet, years afterwards, made whole, He held the sceptre of his soul. And lo! with faces all elate With such a joy, so deep, so great, That its most dear, most sweet, and chief Resemblance was to glorious grief, They stood in voiceless transport round, Naught owing to articulate sound; But a soft music forth doth press And swells, and falls, from all their dress; For, as their nature stands above The power of tongue to tell their love, God makes from forth their garments' hem Music go out and speak for them. These looked, and loved him with their eyes Filled with pass-words from Paradise; âAnd evermore,â he sang, âthe sign Given, swift-answered, proves them mine!â âAh, Lord,â he said, âI did but seek To bless with love a maiden meek; A maiden given a royal, free, Most god-like gift,âbut not to me. âI and my staff, wherein amassed Was all my wealth, this Jordan passed; 'Tis Thou who mak'st me here to stand Augmented to a twofold band.â LOVE ETERNAL. Love, if I love thee, 'tis because I need Not eyes to gaze into; not lips to kiss; Not a soft breast for solace; not the bliss Of being loved while loving;âthis, indeed, I thank thee that thou giv'st; but I should bleed Down in my heart for loving so amiss If I had only loved thee, Love, for thisâ Sure to shake off some day like idle weed Entangled round my foot upon the shore. No, if I love thee, Love, it is because Beauty that is eternal I adore, And must pursue it, whereso'er it draws. And lo! I travel on; I may not pause; With thee I travel on for evermore. THE SNOWDROP. Thy month and mine,âbleak Februere,â The shivering snowdrop month, we share;â Snowdrop, whereby doth Nature show How much her thoughts excel the snow. Sweet frigid firstling of the year, Slight scent is in this flower sincere, Yet Februere for us doth bring The joy of all the flowers of spring. So take the little gift, and dream Of lilies floating down a stream With early roses, breathing scent Full spring-like and most excellent. And in like spirit dream this gift Is precious; or, if thou must sift Reality from dream, yet say, This is a true love-gift to-day; A gift of love as true and fair, As is our flower of Februere, Whose early coming doth express Both purity and faithfulness. And know, that if the gift had been Co-equal with the love, no queen Could look more rich, though she made bold Her brow and dress with gems and gold. THE SHEPHERDESS. What plenteous largess from her hands Descends in gentle showers! The maiden in the garden stands, And feeds her flock of flowers. I thank thee, duteous Shepherdess;â Though 'tis unknown to me Whether those streams enlivening bless The flowers most, or thee. A RAILWAY RIDE. While I ride, while I ride, While past field and village glide, Streaming goes my heart's desire Like a back-blown flame of fire, Longing ever to abide Far behind me, while I ride. O my Queen, O my Queen, Canst thou feel that flame unseen, Flame not hurting though it burns, Flame that homeward still returns, Growing ever, eager, keen, To thee rushing, O my Queen? Dost thou know, dost thou know What it is that warms thee so, Bids thee be of happy cheer, Lifts thee into heavenly sphere, Makes thee every fear forego In my absence,âdost thou know? It shall burn, it shall burn Till its master doth return, Nor shall then its glowings cease, But for evermore, in peace, Fed from an exhaustless urn By good angels, it shall burn. While I ride, while I ride, While o'er railway swiftly glide On the wheels whose rhythmic beat Sets itself to music sweet, This the song of loving pride Sung within me while I ride. TO A. M. W. ON RECEIPT OF AURORA, A VOLUME OF POEMS BY A. A. &amp; A. M. What though on my floor I stood foot-sore, Weary with wintry weather? From my friend, like a bird, There comes a word, And I dance as on thyme and heather; For I hear a voice That sings to a voice, And a voice to a voice replying, And well may the songs The hearer rejoice Of two such hearts close-lying. âWith hands well wed, On the loom,â I said, âThey have wrought in golden weather, He with the warp, She with the weft, On the wonderful loom together. 'Tween the threads he has brought Of regal thought Her magic shuttle plying, A noble woof Is this they have wrought Of poesy undying.â My friend, it shall rest A star on my breast, It shall be in my cap a feather, That mine is a share Of the fabric fair That ye twain wove together. Hear now a voice That sings to a voice, And a voice to a voice replying, âYour thought-robe fair Your friends will wear And love with a love undying.â 1874. THE DRINK DRAGON. There is a murderous Thing abroad, What need to tell its name? Is it not written everwhere In deeds of sin and shame? A Dragon huge this monster is; Its claws are many and strong, What living thing it sets them on Shall not last overlong. Its eyelids are like doors of vaults Set over against each other; Its cruel eyes would never shut From one year's end to another, Only at given, law-set times They are forced to droop and blink; But ever it chews and champs its chain, This greedy Dragon of Drink. Now where shall we the weapon find That must this monster slay? We thank you, noble men of Maine, For ye have shown the way. A woman slinks along the street; Her face is hungry and thin; The gaps in her rags, if pieced, are but pieced With patches of shivering skin. Would you believe it? A happier bride There never was than she On the day when her lover said âI willâ Neath the church's old roof-tree. Yes, and his true intent it was To love and cherish her then, But the Dragon of Drink, though it goes to church, Has never said Amen. âI will;ââthe words were strong and clear; âNow lies the sot in the gutter, And scarcely a thing's to be understood Of aught that he can utter. How shall we make him a man again, His wife's defence and stay? We thank you, noble men of Maine, For ye have shown the way. How sweet to watch yon little child With curly locks that twist About the neck and cheek that seem Made chiefly to be kissed! O guard the precious human life Within that tender frame! You would not have it come to harm For anything we could name. Alas! that child has ceased to breathe; It perished yesterday;â The little thing was scalded to death In midst of its childish play;â Or, the hard cart-wheel crush'd down its head And mixed the brain with the mire; Or, it died in flames, while its mother's throat Was inflamed with a slower fire. Oh how shall we deal with that which takes The very babes for a prey? We thank you, noble men of Maine, For ye have shown the way. How sweet to watch yon little child With curly locks that twist About the neck and cheek that seem Made chiefly to be kissed! O guard the precious human life Within that tender frame! You would not have it come to harm For anything we could name. Alas! that child has ceased to breathe; It perished yesterday;â The little thing was scalded to death In midst of its childish play;â Or, the hard cart-wheel crush'd down its head And mixed the brain with the mire; Or, it died in flames, while its mother's throat Was inflamed with a slower fire. Oh how shall we deal with that which takes The very babes for a prey? We thank you, noble men of Maine, For ye have shown the way. She stands by his side, no lawful bride;â All her heart's love misplaced;â No manly thought was in his soul That the drink has not effaced. Alas for love not soaring above Earth's miserable mire! And alas for honour foully cast In passion's lake of fire! O fallen, fallen evermore, And lost her honest fame! Ah, mother dear, ah, father dear, She brings you sorrow and shame! 'Twas Drink that lent him power to blight;â Drink drugg'd her conscience dim, And bound her soul on an altar cursed, A sacrifice to him. How shall we stop such wrongs and shames, Committed day by day? We thank you, noble men of Maine, For ye have shown the way. This cell is tenanted by one Who broke a house in the night; This other holds one heavy-eyed, Who slew a man in a fight; Here is a lad not ten years old,â Vice led, he followed its trail; But if they who bred him had shunn'd the Drink, He would not have been in jail. Yonder's the thing that bruised his wife Within an inch of her life; On this bed lies the gasping wretch Who opened his throat with a knife. There's not one here on whom the law Has lock'd the prison-door, Whose doom had not gone out of the mouth Of the Dragon of Drink before. O brothers, let us up and cure This monster-ill of the day! We thank the noble men of Maine, That they have shown the way. 1854. THE MAINE LAW-HAMMER. There's a thing that is done, Have ye seen? Have ye seen This horrible thing that is done? For silver and gold Destruction is sold To scores, for the profit of one. Good creatures of God Stamp'd down in the clod, Stamp'd down inch by inch and piecemeal, Flesh and blood, flesh and blood Trod down into mud, And it reddens the drinkseller's heel! O to think of it, beat And broke under his feet! And still, when his crime we condemn, Men say, âIt must be; No help for it; he Has an interest vested in them!â Though even the rod And the staff of their God, To be fuel for him, some have sold; We're forbidden to say, âSnatch, snatch them away!â Lest the publican's fire grow cold! Ah! yet there's a word,â Have ye heard? Have ye heard? There's a small living thought like a seed; In good soil it was sown; To a word it has grown; Hurrah! it shall grow to a deed! That deed, like a tree, Shall luxuriant be; It shall shelter the world, for it ought; Oh! it's good, it is grand, With the knee and the hand, To pray and to work for that thought! We have dared to conceive, We have dared to believe,â Ay, bound ourselves fast with a bond,â Though down to our day This wrong has had sway, Not long shall it tarry beyond. Do ye doubt? Do ye dare To doubt and despair? O look to the west, o'er the sea! What we have begun They already have done, And they are but mortals as we. Again and again, O brothers! O men! We have ventured to bruit it about, That the drinkseller's cask, His bottle and flask, Were improved if their bottoms were out! Already we stand With hammer in hand, The mighty law-hammer of Maine, And devoutly we vow, God helping us now, It shall not be lifted in vain. 1854.</field>
