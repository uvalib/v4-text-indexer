      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I I Goblin Market and Other Poems (1862) GOBLIN MARKET. Morning and evening Maids heard the goblins cry: “Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy, come buy: Apples and quinces, Lemons and oranges, Plump unpecked cherries, Melons and raspberries, Bloom-down-cheeked peaches, Swart-headed mulberries, Wild free-born cranberries, Crab-apples, dewberries, Pine-apples, blackberries, Apricots, strawberries;— All ripe together In summer weather,— Morns that pass by, Fair eves that fly; Come buy, come buy: Our grapes fresh from the vine, Pomegranates full and fine, Dates and sharp bullaces, Rare pears and greengages, Damsons and bilberries, Taste them and try: Currants and gooseberries, Bright-fire-like barberries, Figs to fill your mouth, Citrons from the South, Sweet to tongue and sound to eye; Come buy, come buy.” Evening by evening Among the brookside rushes, Laura bowed her head to hear, Lizzie veiled her blushes: Crouching close together In the cooling weather, With clasping arms and cautioning lips, With tingling cheeks and finger tips. “Lie close,” Laura said, Pricking up her golden head: “We must not look at goblin men, We must not buy their fruits: Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots?” “Come buy,” call the goblins Hobbling down the glen. “Oh,” cried Lizzie, “Laura, Laura, You should not peep at goblin men.” Lizzie covered up her eyes, Covered close lest they should look; Laura reared her glossy head, And whispered like the restless brook: “Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie, Down the glen tramp little men. One hauls a basket, One bears a plate, One lugs a golden dish Of many pounds weight. How fair the vine must grow Whose grapes are so luscious; How warm the wind must blow Thro' those fruit bushes.” “No,” said Lizzie: “No, no, no; Their offers should not charm us, Their evil gifts would harm us.” She thrust a dimpled finger In each ear, shut eyes and ran: Curious Laura chose to linger Wondering at each merchant man. One had a cat's face, One whisked a tail, One tramped at a rat's pace, One crawled like a snail, One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry, One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry. She heard a voice like voice of doves Cooing all together: They sounded kind and full of loves In the pleasant weather. Laura stretched her gleaming neck Like a rush-imbedded swan, Like a lily from the beck, Like a moonlit poplar branch, Like a vessel at the launch When its last restraint is gone. Backwards up the mossy glen Turned and trooped the goblin men, With their shrill repeated cry, “Come buy, come buy.” When they reached where Laura was They stood stock still upon the moss, Leering at each other, Brother with queer brother; Signalling each other, Brother with sly brother. One set his basket down, One reared his plate; One began to weave a crown Of tendrils, leaves and rough nuts brown (Men sell not such in any town); One heaved the golden weight Of dish and fruit to offer her: “Come buy, come buy,” was still their cry. Laura stared but did not stir, Longed but had no money: The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste In tones as smooth as honey, The cat-faced purr'd, The rat-paced spoke a word Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard; One parrot-voiced and jolly Cried “Pretty Goblin” still for “Pretty Polly;”— One whistled like a bird. But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste: “Good folk, I have no coin; To take were to purloin: I have no copper in my purse, I have no silver either, And all my gold is on the furze That shakes in windy weather Above the rusty heather.” “You have much gold upon your head,” They answered all together: “Buy from us with a golden curl.” She clipped a precious golden lock, She dropped a tear more rare than pearl, Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red: Sweeter than honey from the rock. Stronger than man-rejoicing wine, Clearer than water flowed that juice; She never tasted such before, How should it cloy with length of use? She sucked and sucked and sucked the more Fruits which that unknown orchard bore; She sucked until her lips were sore; Then flung the emptied rinds away But gathered up one kernel-stone, And knew not was it night or day As she turned home alone. Lizzie met her at the gate Full of wise upbraidings: “Dear, you should not stay so late, Twilight is not good for maidens; Should not loiter in the glen In the haunts of goblin men. Do you not remember Jeanie, How she met them in the moonlight, Took their gifts both choice and many, Ate their fruits and wore their flowers Plucked from bowers Where summer ripens at all hours? But ever in the noonlight She pined and pined away; Sought them by night and day, Found them no more but dwindled and grew grey; Then fell with the first snow, While to this day no grass will grow Where she lies low: I planted daisies there a year ago That never blow. You should not loiter so.” “Nay, hush,” said Laura: “Nay, hush, my sister: I ate and ate my fill, Yet my mouth waters still; Tomorrow night I will Buy more:” and kissed her: “Have done with sorrow; I'll bring you plums tomorrow Fresh on their mother twigs, Cherries worth getting; You cannot think what figs My teeth have met in, What melons icy-cold Piled on a dish of gold Too huge for me to hold, What peaches with a velvet nap, Pellucid grapes without one seed: Odorous indeed must be the mead Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink With lilies at the brink, And sugar-sweet their sap.” Golden head by golden head, Like two pigeons in one nest Folded in each other's wings, They lay down in their curtained bed: Like two blossoms on one stem, Like two flakes of new-fall'n snow, Like two wands of ivory Tipped with gold for awful kings. Moon and stars gazed in at them, Wind sang to them lullaby, Lumbering owls forbore to fly, Not a bat flapped to and fro Round their rest: Cheek to cheek and breast to breast Locked together in one nest. Early in the morning When the first cock crowed his warning, Neat like bees, as sweet and busy, Laura rose with Lizzie: Fetched in honey, milked the cows, Aired and set to rights the house, Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat, Cakes for dainty mouths to eat, Next churned butter, whipped up cream, Fed their poultry, sat and sewed; Talked as modest maidens should: Lizzie with an open heart, Laura in an absent dream, One content, one sick in part; One warbling for the mere bright day's delight, One longing for the night. At length slow evening came: They went with pitchers to the reedy brook; Lizzie most placid in her look, Laura most like a leaping flame. They drew the gurgling water from its deep; Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags, Then turning homewards said: “The sunset flushes Those furthest loftiest crags; Come, Laura, not another maiden lags, No wilful squirrel wags, The beasts and birds are fast asleep.” But Laura loitered still among the rushes And said the bank was steep. And said the hour was early still, The dew not fall'n, the wind not chill: Listening ever, but not catching The customary cry, “Come buy, come buy,” With its iterated jingle Of sugar-baited words: Not for all her watching Once discerning even one goblin Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling; Let alone the herds That used to tramp along the glen, In groups or single, Of brisk fruit-merchant men. Till Lizzie urged, “O Laura, come; I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look: You should not loiter longer at this brook: Come with me home. The stars rise, the moon bends her arc, Each glowworm winks her spark, Let us get home before the night grows dark: For clouds may gather Tho' this is summer weather, Put out the lights and drench us thro'; Then if we lost our way what should we do?” Laura turned cold as stone To find her sister heard that cry alone, That goblin cry, “Come buy our fruits, come buy.” Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit? Must she no more such succous pasture find, Gone deaf and blind? Her tree of life drooped from the root: She said not one word in her heart's sore ache; But peering thro' the dimness, nought discerning, Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way; So crept to bed, and lay Silent till Lizzie slept; Then sat up in a passionate yearning, And gnashed her teeth for baulked desire, and wept As if her heart would break. Day after day, night after night, Laura kept watch in vain In sullen silence of exceeding pain. She never caught again the goblin cry: “Come buy, come buy;”— She never spied the goblin men Hawking their fruits along the glen: But when the noon waxed bright Her hair grew thin and gray; She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn To swift decay and burn Her fire away. One day remembering her kernel-stone She set it by a wall that faced the south; Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root, Watched for a waxing shoot, But there came none; It never saw the sun, It never felt the trickling moisture run: While with sunk eyes and faded mouth She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees False waves in desert drouth With shade of leaf-crowned trees, And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze. She no more swept the house, Tended the fowls or cows, Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat, Brought water from the brook: But sat down listless in the chimney-nook And would not eat. Tender Lizzie could not bear To watch her sister's cankerous care Yet not to share. She night and morning Caught the goblins' cry: “Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy, come buy:”— Beside the brook, along the glen, She heard the tramp of goblin men, The voice and stir Poor Laura could not hear; Longed to buy fruit to comfort her, But feared to pay too dear. She thought of Jeanie in her grave, Who should have been a bride; But who for joys brides hope to have Fell sick and died In her gay prime, In earliest Winter time, With the first glazing rime, With the first snow-fall of crisp Winter time. Till Laura dwindling Seemed knocking at Death's door: Then Lizzie weighed no more Better and worse; But put a silver penny in her purse, Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze At twilight, halted by the brook: And for the first time in her life Began to listen and look. Laughed every goblin When they spied her peeping: Came towards her hobbling, Flying, running, leaping, Puffing and blowing, Chuckling, clapping, crowing, Clucking and gobbling, Mopping and mowing, Full of airs and graces, Pulling wry faces, Demure grimaces, Cat-like and rat-like, Ratel-and wombat-like, Snail-paced in a hurry, Parrot-voiced and whistler, Helter skelter, hurry skurry, Chattering like magpies, Fluttering like pigeons, Gliding like fishes,— Hugged her and kissed her, Squeezed and caressed her: Stretched up their dishes, Panniers, and plates: “Look at our apples Russet and dun, Bob at our cherries, Bite at our peaches, Citrons and dates, Grapes for the asking, Pears red with basking Out in the sun, Plums on their twigs; Pluck them and suck them, Pomegranates, figs.”— “Good folk,” said Lizzie, Mindful of Jeanie: “Give me much and many:”— Held out her apron, Tossed them her penny. “Nay, take a seat with us, Honour and eat with us,” They answered grinning: “Our feast is but beginning. Night yet is early, Warm and dew-pearly, Wakeful and starry: Such fruits as these No man can carry; Half their bloom would fly, Half their dew would dry, Half their flavour would pass by. Sit down and feast with us, Be welcome guest with us, Cheer you and rest with us.”— “Thank you,” said Lizzie: “But one waits At home alone for me: So without further parleying, If you will not sell me any Of your fruits tho' much and many, Give me back my silver penny I tossed you for a fee.”— They began to scratch their pates, No longer wagging, purring, But visibly demurring, Grunting and snarling. One called her proud, Cross-grained, uncivil; Their tones waxed loud, Their looks were evil. Lashing their tails They trod and hustled her, Elbowed and jostled her, Clawed with their nails, Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking, Tore her gown and soiled her stocking, Twitched her hair out by the roots, Stamped upon her tender feet, Held her hands and squeezed their fruits Against her mouth to make her eat. White and golden Lizzie stood, Like a lily in a flood,— Like a rock of blue-veined stone Lashed by tides obstreperously,— Like a beacon left alone In a hoary roaring sea, Sending up a golden fire,— Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree White with blossoms honey-sweet Sore beset by wasp and bee,— Like a royal virgin town Topped with gilded dome and spire Close beleaguered by a fleet Mad to tug her standard down. One may lead a horse to water, Twenty cannot make him drink. Tho' the goblins cuffed and caught her, Coaxed and fought her, Bullied and besought her, Scratched her, pinched her black as ink, Kicked and knocked her, Mauled and mocked her, Lizzie uttered not a word; Would not open lip from lip Lest they should cram a mouthful in: But laughed in heart to feel the drip Of juice that syrupped all her face, And lodged in dimples of her chin, And streaked her neck which quaked like curd. At last the evil people Worn out by her resistance Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit Along whichever road they took, Not leaving root or stone or shoot; Some writhed into the ground, Some dived into the brook With ring and ripple, Some scudded on the gale without a sound, Some vanished in the distance. In a smart, ache, tingle, Lizzie went her way; Knew not was it night or day; Sprang up the bank, tore thro' the furze, Threaded copse and dingle, And heard her penny jingle Bouncing in her purse, Its bounce was music to her ear. She ran and ran As if she feared some goblin man Dogged her with gibe or curse Or something worse: But not one goblin skurried after, Nor was she pricked by fear; The kind heart made her windy-paced That urged her home quite out of breath with haste And inward laughter. She cried “Laura,” up the garden, “Did you miss me? Come and kiss me. Never mind my bruises, Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices Squeezed from goblin fruits for you, Goblin pulp and goblin dew. Eat me, drink me, love me; Laura, make much of me: For your sake I have braved the glen And had to do with goblin merchant men.” Laura started from her chair, Flung her arms up in the air, Clutched her hair: “Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted For my sake the fruit forbidden? Must your light like mine be hidden, Your young life like mine be wasted, Undone in mine undoing And ruined in my ruin, Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?”— She clung about her sister, Kissed and kissed and kissed her: Tears once again Refreshed her shrunken eyes, Dropping like rain After long sultry drouth; Shaking with aguish fear, and pain, She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth. Her lips began to scorch, That juice was wormwood to her tongue, She loathed the feast: Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung, Rent all her robe, and wrung Her hands in lamentable haste, And beat her breast. Her locks streamed like the torch Borne by a racer at full speed, Or like the mane of horses in their flight, Or like an eagle when she stems the light Straight toward the sun, Or like a caged thing freed, Or like a flying flag when armies run. Swift fire spread thro' her veins, knocked at her heart, Met the fire smouldering there And overbore its lesser flame; She gorged on bitterness without a name: Ah! fool, to choose such part Of soul-consuming care! Sense failed in the mortal strife: Like the watch-tower of a town Which an earthquake shatters down, Like a lightning-stricken mast, Like a wind-uprooted tree Spun about, Like a foam-topped waterspout Cast down headlong in the sea, She fell at last; Pleasure past and anguish past, Is it death or is it life? Life out of death. That night long Lizzie watched by her, Counted her pulse's flagging stir, Felt for her breath, Held water to her lips, and cooled her face With tears and fanning leaves: But when the first birds chirped about their eaves, And early reapers plodded to the place Of golden sheaves, And dew-wet grass Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass, And new buds with new day Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream, Laura awoke as from a dream, Laughed in the innocent old way, Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice; Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of grey, Her breath was sweet as May And light danced in her eyes. Days, weeks, months, years Afterwards, when both were wives With children of their own; Their mother-hearts beset with fears, Their lives bound up in tender lives; Laura would call the little ones And tell them of her early prime, Those pleasant days long gone Of not-returning time: Would talk about the haunted glen, The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men, Their fruits like honey to the throat But poison in the blood; (Men sell not such in any town:) Would tell them how her sister stood In deadly peril to do her good, And win the fiery antidote: Then joining hands to little hands Would bid them cling together, “For there is no friend like a sister In calm or stormy weather; To cheer one on the tedious way, To fetch one if one goes astray, To lift one if one totters down, To strengthen whilst one stands.” IN THE ROUND TOWER AT JHANSI, JUNE 8, 1857. A hundred, a thousand to one; even so; Not a hope in the world remained: The swarming howling wretches below Gained and gained and gained. Skene looked at his pale young wife:— “Is the time come?”—“The time is come!”— Young, strong, and so full of life: The agony struck them dumb. Close his arm about her now, Close her cheek to his, Close the pistol to her brow— God forgive them this! “Will it hurt much?”—“No, mine own: I wish I could bear the pang for both.” “I wish I could bear the pang alone: Courage, dear, I am not loth.” Kiss and kiss: “It is not pain Thus to kiss and die. One kiss more.”—“And yet one again.”— “Good bye.”—“Good bye.” I retain this little poem, not as historically accurate, but as written and published before I heard the supposed facts of its first verse contradicted. DREAM-LAND. Where sunless rivers weep Their waves into the deep, She sleeps a charmèd sleep: Awake her not. Led by a single star, She came from very far To seek where shadows are Her pleasant lot. She left the rosy morn, She left the fields of corn, For twilight cold and lorn And water springs. Thro' sleep, as thro' a veil, She sees the sky look pale, And hears the nightingale That sadly sings. Rest, rest, a perfect rest Shed over brow and breast; Her face is toward the west, The purple land. She cannot see the grain Ripening on hill and plain; She cannot feel the rain Upon her hand. Rest, rest, for evermore Upon a mossy shore; Rest, rest at the heart's core Till time shall cease: Sleep that no pain shall wake; Night that no morn shall break, Till joy shall overtake Her perfect peace. AT HOME. When I was dead, my spirit turned To seek the much frequented house: I passed the door, and saw my friends Feasting beneath green orange boughs; From hand to hand they pushed the wine, They sucked the pulp of plum and peach; They sang, they jested, and they laughed, For each was loved of each. I listened to their honest chat: Said one: “Tomorrow we shall be Plod plod along the featureless sands And coasting miles and miles of sea.” Said one: “Before the turn of tide We will achieve the eyrie-seat.” Said one: “Tomorrow shall be like Today, but much more sweet.” “Tomorrow,” said they, strong with hope, And dwelt upon the pleasant way: “Tomorrow,” cried they one and all, While no one spoke of yesterday. Their life stood full at blessed noon; I, only I, had passed away: “Tomorrow and today,” they cried; I was of yesterday. I shivered comfortless, but cast No chill across the tablecloth; I all-forgotten shivered, sad To stay and yet to part how loth: I passed from the familiar room, I who from love had passed away, Like the remembrance of a guest That tarrieth but a day. A TRIAD. Three sang of love together: one with lips Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow, Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips; And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show; And one was blue with famine after love, Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low The burden of what those were singing of. One shamed herself in love; one temperately Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife; One famished died for love. Thus two of three Took death for love and won him after strife; One droned in sweetness like a fattened bee: All on the threshold, yet all short of life. LOVE FROM THE NORTH. I had a love in soft south land, Beloved thro' April far in May; He waited on my lightest breath, And never dared to say me nay. He saddened if my cheer was sad, But gay he grew if I was gay; We never differed on a hair, My yes his yes, my nay his nay. The wedding hour was come, the aisles Were flushed with sun and flowers that day; I pacing balanced in my thoughts: “It's quite too late to think of nay.”— My bridegroom answered in his turn, Myself had almost answered “yea:” When thro' the flashing nave I heard A struggle and resounding “nay”. Bridemaids and bridegroom shrank in fear, But I stood high who stood at bay: “And if I answer yea, fair Sir, What man art thou to bar with nay?” He was a strong man from the north, Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous grey: “Put yea by for another time In which I will not say thee nay.” He took me in his strong white arms, He bore me on his horse away O'er crag, morass, and hairbreadth pass, But never asked me yea or nay. He made me fast with book and bell, With links of love he makes me stay; Till now I've neither heart nor power Nor will nor wish to say him nay. WINTER RAIN. Every valley drinks, Every dell and hollow: Where the kind rain sinks and sinks, Green of Spring will follow. Yet a lapse of weeks Buds will burst their edges, Strip their wool-coats, glue-coats, streaks, In the woods and hedges; Weave a bower of love For birds to meet each other, Weave a canopy above Nest and egg and mother. But for fattening rain We should have no flowers, Never a bud or leaf again But for soaking showers; Never a mated bird In the rocking tree-tops, Never indeed a flock or herd To graze upon the lea-crops. Lambs so woolly white, Sheep the sun-bright leas on, They could have no grass to bite But for rain in season. We should find no moss In the shadiest places, Find no waving meadow grass Pied with broad-eyed daisies: But miles of barren sand, With never a son or daughter, Not a lily on the land, Or lily on the water. COUSIN KATE. I was a cottage maiden Hardened by sun and air, Contented with my cottage mates, Not mindful I was fair. Why did a great lord find me out, And praise my flaxen hair? Why did a great lord find me out To fill my heart with care? He lured me to his palace home— Woe's me for joy thereof— To lead a shameless shameful life, His plaything and his love. He wore me like a silken knot, He changed me like a glove; So now I moan, an unclean thing, Who might have been a dove. O Lady Kate, my cousin Kate, You grew more fair than I: He saw you at your father's gate, Chose you, and cast me by. He watched your steps along the lane, Your work among the rye; He lifted you from mean estate To sit with him on high. Because you were so good and pure He bound you with his ring: The neighbours call you good and pure, Call me an outcast thing. Even so I sit and howl in dust, You sit in gold and sing: Now which of us has tenderer heart? You had the stronger wing. O cousin Kate, my love was true, Your love was writ in sand: If he had fooled not me but you, If you stood where I stand, He'd not have won me with his love Nor bought me with his land; I would have spit into his face And not have taken his hand. Yet I've a gift you have not got, And seem not like to get: For all your clothes and wedding-ring I've little doubt you fret. My fair-haired son, my shame, my pride, Cling closer, closer yet: Your father would give lands for one To wear his coronet. NOBLE SISTERS. “Now did you mark a falcon, Sister dear, sister dear, Flying toward my window In the morning cool and clear? With jingling bells about her neck, But what beneath her wing? It may have been a ribbon, Or it may have been a ring.”— “I marked a falcon swooping At the break of day: And for your love, my sister dove, I 'frayed the thief away.”— “Or did you spy a ruddy hound, Sister fair and tall, Went snuffing round my garden bound, Or crouched by my bower wall? With a silken leash about his neck; But in his mouth may be A chain of gold and silver links, Or a letter writ to me.”— “I heard a hound, highborn sister, Stood baying at the moon: I rose and drove him from your wall Lest you should wake too soon.”— “Or did you meet a pretty page Sat swinging on the gate; Sat whistling whistling like a bird, Or may be slept too late: With eaglets broidered on his cap, And eaglets on his glove? If you had turned his pockets out, You had found some pledge of love.”— “I met him at this daybreak, Scarce the east was red: Lest the creaking gate should anger you, I packed him home to bed.”— “Oh patience, sister. Did you see A young man tall and strong, Swift-footed to uphold the right And to uproot the wrong, Come home across the desolate sea To woo me for his wife? And in his heart my heart is locked, And in his life my life.”— “I met a nameless man, sister, Who loitered round our door: I said: Her husband loves her much, And yet she loves him more.”— “Fie, sister, fie, a wicked lie, A lie, a wicked lie, I have none other love but him, Nor will have till I die. And you have turned him from our door, And stabbed him with a lie: I will go seek him thro' the world In sorrow till I die.”— “Go seek in sorrow, sister, And find in sorrow too: If thus you shame our father's name My curse go forth with you.” SPRING. Frost-locked all the winter, Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits, What shall make their sap ascend That they may put forth shoots? Tips of tender green, Leaf, or blade, or sheath; Telling of the hidden life That breaks forth underneath, Life nursed in its grave by Death. Blows the thaw-wind pleasantly, Drips the soaking rain, By fits looks down the waking sun: Young grass springs on the plain; Young leaves clothe early hedgerow trees; Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits, Swollen with sap put forth their shoots; Curled-headed ferns sprout in the lane; Birds sing and pair again. There is no time like Spring, When life's alive in everything, Before new nestlings sing, Before cleft swallows speed their journey back Along the trackless track— God guides their wing, He spreads their table that they nothing lack,— Before the daisy grows a common flower, Before the sun has power To scorch the world up in his noontide hour. There is no time like Spring, Like Spring that passes by; There is no life like Spring-life born to die,— Piercing the sod, Clothing the uncouth clod, Hatched in the nest, Fledged on the windy bough, Strong on the wing: There is no time like Spring that passes by, Now newly born, and now Hastening to die. THE LAMBS OF GRASMERE, 1860. The upland flocks grew starved and thinned: Their shepherds scarce could feed the lambs Whose milkless mothers butted them, Or who were orphaned of their dams. The lambs athirst for mother's milk Filled all the place with piteous sounds: Their mothers' bones made white for miles The pastureless wet pasture grounds. Day after day, night after night, From lamb to lamb the shepherds went, With teapots for the bleating mouths Instead of nature's nourishment. The little shivering gaping things Soon knew the step that brought them aid, And fondled the protecting hand, And rubbed it with a woolly head. Then, as the days waxed on to weeks, It was a pretty sight to see These lambs with frisky heads and tails Skipping and leaping on the lea, Bleating in tender, trustful tones, Resting on rocky crag or mound, And following the beloved feet That once had sought for them and found. These very shepherds of their flocks, These loving lambs so meek to please, Are worthy of recording words And honour in their due degrees: So I might live a hundred years, And roam from strand to foreign strand, Yet not forget this flooded spring And scarce-saved lambs of Westmoreland. A BIRTHDAY. My heart is like a singing bird Whose nest is in a watered shoot; My heart is like an apple tree Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit; My heart is like a rainbow shell That paddles in a halcyon sea; My heart is gladder than all these Because my love is come to me. Raise me a dais of silk and down; Hang it with vair and purple dyes; Carve it in doves and pomegranates, And peacocks with a hundred eyes; Work it in gold and silver grapes, In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys; Because the birthday of my life Is come, my love is come to me. REMEMBER. Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand, Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay. Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you planned: Only remember me; you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray. Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve: For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad. AFTER DEATH. The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay, Where thro' the lattice ivy-shadows crept. He leaned above me, thinking that I slept And could not hear him; but I heard him say: “Poor child, poor child:” and as he turned away Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept. He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold That hid my face, or take my hand in his, Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head: He did not love me living; but once dead He pitied me; and very sweet it is To know he still is warm tho' I am cold. AN END. Love, strong as Death, is dead. Come, let us make his bed Among the dying flowers: A green turf at his head; And a stone at his feet, Whereon we may sit In the quiet evening hours. He was born in the Spring, And died before the harvesting: On the last warm Summer day He left us; he would not stay For Autumn twilight cold and gray. Sit we by his grave, and sing He is gone away. To few chords and sad and low Sing we so: Be our eyes fixed on the grass Shadow-veiled as the years pass, While we think of all that was In the long ago. MY DREAM. Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night, Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth. I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled Like overflowing Jordan in its youth: It waxed and coloured sensibly to sight, Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew, Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew. The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend, My closest friend would deem the facts untrue; And therefore it were wisely left untold; Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end. Each crocodile was girt with massive gold And polished stones that with their wearers grew: But one there was who waxed beyond the rest, Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown, Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast. All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale, But special burnishment adorned his mail And special terror weighed upon his frown; His punier brethren quaked before his tail, Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail. So he grew lord and master of his kin: But who shall tell the tale of all their woes? An execrable appetite arose, He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in. He knew no law, he feared no binding law, But ground them with inexorable jaw: The luscious fat distilled upon his chin, Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes, While still like hungry death he fed his maw; Till every minor crocodile being dead And buried too, himself gorged to the full, He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw. Oh marvel passing strange which next I saw: In sleep he dwindled to the common size, And all the empire faded from his coat. Then from far off a wingèd vessel came, Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame: I know not what it bore of freight or host, But white it was as an avenging ghost. It levelled strong Euphrates in its course; Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote It seemed to tame the waters without force Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat: Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands, The prudent crocodile rose on his feet And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands. What can it mean? you ask. I answer not For meaning, but myself must echo, What? And tell it as I saw it on the spot. SONG. [Oh roses for the flush of youth] Oh roses for the flush of youth, And laurel for the perfect prime; But pluck an ivy branch for me Grown old before my time. Oh violets for the grave of youth, And bay for those dead in their prime; Give me the withered leaves I chose Before in the old time. THE HOUR AND THE GHOST. BRIDE. O love, love, hold me fast, He draws me away from thee; I cannot stem the blast, Nor the cold strong sea: Far away a light shines Beyond the hills and pines; It is lit for me. BRIDEGROOM. I have thee close, my dear, No terror can come near; Only far off the northern light shines clear. GHOST. Come with me, fair and false, To our home, come home. It is my voice that calls: Once thou wast not afraid When I woo'd, and said, “Come, our nest is newly made”— Now cross the tossing foam. BRIDE. Hold me one moment longer, He taunts me with the past, His clutch is waxing stronger, Hold me fast, hold me fast. He draws me from thy heart, And I cannot withhold: He bids my spirit depart With him into the cold:— Oh bitter vows of old! BRIDEGROOM. Lean on me, hide thine eyes: Only ourselves, earth and skies, Are present here: be wise. GHOST. Lean on me, come away, I will guide and steady: Come, for I will not stay: Come, for house and bed are ready. Ah, sure bed and house, For better and worse, for life and death: Goal won with shortened breath: Come, crown our vows. BRIDE. One moment, one more word, While my heart beats still, While my breath is stirred By my fainting will. O friend forsake me not, Forget not as I forgot: But keep thy heart for me, Keep thy faith true and bright; Thro' the lone cold winter night Perhaps I may come to thee. BRIDEGROOM. Nay peace, my darling, peace: Let these dreams and terrors cease: Who spoke of death or change or aught but ease? GHOST. O fair frail sin, O poor harvest gathered in! Thou shalt visit him again To watch his heart grow cold; To know the gnawing pain I knew of old; To see one much more fair Fill up the vacant chair, Fill his heart, his children bear:— While thou and I together In the outcast weather Toss and howl and spin. A SUMMER WISH. Live all thy sweet life thro', Sweet Rose, dew-sprent, Drop down thine evening dew To gather it anew When day is bright: I fancy thou wast meant Chiefly to give delight. Sing in the silent sky, Glad soaring bird; Sing out thy notes on high To sunbeam straying by Or passing cloud; Heedless if thou art heard Sing thy full song aloud. Oh that it were with me As with the flower; Blooming on its own tree For butterfly and bee Its summer morns: That I might bloom mine hour A rose in spite of thorns. Oh that my work were done As birds' that soar Rejoicing in the sun: That when my time is run And daylight too, I so might rest once more Cool with refreshing dew. AN APPLE-GATHERING. I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple tree And wore them all that evening in my hair: Then in due season when I went to see I found no apples there. With dangling basket all along the grass As I had come I went the selfsame track: My neighbours mocked me while they saw me pass So empty-handed back. Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by, Their heaped-up basket teazed me like a jeer; Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky, Their mother's home was near. Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full, A stronger hand than hers helped it along; A voice talked with her thro' the shadows cool More sweet to me than song. Ah Willie, Willie, was my love less worth Than apples with their green leaves piled above? I counted rosiest apples on the earth Of far less worth than love. So once it was with me you stooped to talk Laughing and listening in this very lane: To think that by this way we used to walk We shall not walk again! I let my neighbours pass me, ones and twos And groups; the latest said the night grew chill, And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews Fell fast I loitered still. SONG. [Two doves upon the selfsame branch] Two doves upon the selfsame branch, Two lilies on a single stem, Two butterflies upon one flower:— Oh happy they who look on them. Who look upon them hand in hand Flushed in the rosy summer light; Who look upon them hand in hand And never give a thought to night. MAUDE CLARE. Out of the church she followed them With a lofty step and mien: His bride was like a village maid, Maude Clare was like a queen. “Son Thomas,” his lady mother said, With smiles, almost with tears: “May Nell and you but live as true As we have done for years; “Your father thirty years ago Had just your tale to tell; But he was not so pale as you, Nor I so pale as Nell.” My lord was pale with inward strife, And Nell was pale with pride; My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare Or ever he kissed the bride. “Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord, Have brought my gift,” she said: “To bless the hearth, to bless the board, To bless the marriage-bed. “Here's my half of the golden chain You wore about your neck, That day we waded ankle-deep For lilies in the beck: “Here's my half of the faded leaves We plucked from budding bough, With feet amongst the lily leaves,— The lilies are budding now.” He strove to match her scorn with scorn, He faltered in his place: “Lady,” he said,—“Maude Clare,” he said,— “Maude Clare:”—and hid his face. She turn'd to Nell: “My Lady Nell, I have a gift for you; Tho', were it fruit, the bloom were gone, Or, were it flowers, the dew. “Take my share of a fickle heart, Mine of a paltry love: Take it or leave it as you will, I wash my hands thereof.” “And what you leave,” said Nell, “I'll take, And what you spurn, I'll wear; For he's my lord for better and worse, And him I love, Maude Clare. “Yea, tho' you're taller by the head, More wise, and much more fair; I'll love him till he loves me best, Me best of all, Maude Clare.” ECHO. Come to me in the silence of the night; Come in the speaking silence of a dream; Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright As sunlight on a stream; Come back in tears, O memory, hope, love of finished years. Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet, Whose wakening should have been in Paradise, Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet; Where thirsting longing eyes Watch the slow door That opening, letting in, lets out no more. Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live My very life again tho' cold in death: Come back to me in dreams, that I may give Pulse for pulse, breath for breath: Speak low, lean low, As long ago, my love, how long ago. WINTER: MY SECRET. I tell my secret? No indeed, not I: Perhaps some day, who knows? But not today; it froze, and blows, and snows, And you're too curious: fie! You want to hear it? well: Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell. Or, after all, perhaps there's none: Suppose there is no secret after all, But only just my fun. Today's a nipping day, a biting day; In which one wants a shawl, A veil, a cloak, and other wraps: I cannot ope to every one who taps, And let the draughts come whistling thro' my hall; Come bounding and surrounding me, Come buffeting, astounding me, Nipping and clipping thro' my wraps and all. I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows His nose to Russian snows To be pecked at by every wind that blows? You would not peck? I thank you for good will, Believe, but leave that truth untested still. Spring's an expansive time: yet I don't trust March with its peck of dust, Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers, Nor even May, whose flowers One frost may wither thro' the sunless hours. Perhaps some languid summer day, When drowsy birds sing less and less, And golden fruit is ripening to excess, If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud, And the warm wind is neither still nor loud, Perhaps my secret I may say, Or you may guess. ANOTHER SPRING. If I might see another Spring I'd not plant summer flowers and wait: I'd have my crocuses at once, My leafless pink mezereons, My chill-veined snowdrops, choicer yet My white or azure violet, Leaf-nested primrose; anything To blow at once, not late. If I might see another Spring I'd listen to the daylight birds That build their nests and pair and sing, Nor wait for mateless nightingale; I'd listen to the lusty herds, The ewes with lambs as white as snow, I'd find out music in the hail And all the winds that blow. If I might see another Spring— Oh stinging comment on my past That all my past results in “if”— If I might see another Spring I'd laugh today, today is brief; I would not wait for anything: I'd use today that cannot last, Be glad today and sing. A PEAL OF BELLS. Strike the bells wantonly, Tinkle tinkle well; Bring me wine, bring me flowers, Ring the silver bell. All my lamps burn scented oil, Hung on laden orange trees, Whose shadowed foliage is the foil To golden lamps and oranges. Heap my golden plates with fruit, Golden fruit, fresh-plucked and ripe; Strike the bells and breathe the pipe; Shut out showers from summer hours— Silence that complaining lute— Shut out thinking, shut out pain, From hours that cannot come again. Strike the bells solemnly, Ding dong deep: My friend is passing to his bed, Fast asleep; There's plaited linen round his head, While foremost go his feet— His feet that cannot carry him. My feast's a show, my lights are dim; Be still, your music is not sweet,— There is no music more for him: His lights are out, his feast is done; His bowl that sparkled to the brim Is drained, is broken, cannot hold; My blood is chill, his blood is cold; His death is full, and mine begun. FATA MORGANA. A blue-eyed phantom far before Is laughing, leaping toward the sun: Like lead I chase it evermore, I pant and run. It breaks the sunlight bound on bound: Goes singing as it leaps along To sheep-bells with a dreamy sound A dreamy song. I laugh, it is so brisk and gay; It is so far before, I weep: I hope I shall lie down some day, Lie down and sleep. “NO, THANK YOU, JOHN.” I never said I loved you, John: Why will you teaze me day by day, And wax a weariness to think upon With always “do” and “pray”? You know I never loved you, John; No fault of mine made me your toast: Why will you haunt me with a face as wan As shows an hour-old ghost? I dare say Meg or Moll would take Pity upon you, if you'd ask: And pray don't remain single for my sake Who can't perform that task. I have no heart?—Perhaps I have not; But then you're mad to take offence That I don't give you what I have not got: Use your own common sense. Let bygones be bygones: Don't call me false, who owed not to be true: I'd rather answer “No” to fifty Johns Than answer “Yes” to you. Let's mar our pleasant days no more, Song-birds of passage, days of youth: Catch at today, forget the days before: I'll wink at your untruth. Let us strike hands as hearty friends; No more, no less; and friendship's good: Only don't keep in view ulterior ends, And points not understood In open treaty. Rise above Quibbles and shuffling off and on: Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,— No, thank you, John. MAY. I cannot tell you how it was; But this I know: it came to pass Upon a bright and breezy day When May was young; ah pleasant May! As yet the poppies were not born Between the blades of tender corn; The last eggs had not hatched as yet, Nor any bird foregone its mate. I cannot tell you what it was; But this I know: it did but pass. It passed away with sunny May, With all sweet things it passed away, And left me old, and cold, and grey. A PAUSE OF THOUGHT. I looked for that which is not, nor can be, And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth: But years must pass before a hope of youth Is resigned utterly. I watched and waited with a steadfast will: And though the object seemed to flee away That I so longed for, ever day by day I watched and waited still. Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more; My expectation wearies and shall cease; I will resign it now and be at peace: Yet never gave it o'er. Sometimes I said: It is an empty name I long for; to a name why should I give The peace of all the days I have to live?— Yet gave it all the same. Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit For healthy joy and salutary pain: Thou knowest the chase useless, and again Turnest to follow it. TWILIGHT CALM. Oh pleasant eventide! Clouds on the western side Grow grey and greyer hiding the warm sun: The bees and birds, their happy labours done, Seek their close nests and bide. Screened in the leafy wood The stock-doves sit and brood: The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough But lazily; pauses; and settles now Where once he stored his food. One by one the flowers close, Lily and dewy rose Shutting their tender petals from the moon: The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon Are still the noisy crows. The dormouse squats and eats Choice little dainty bits Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime; Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time And listens where he sits. From far the lowings come Of cattle driven home: From farther still the wind brings fitfully The vast continual murmur of the sea, Now loud, now almost dumb. The gnats whirl in the air, The evening gnats; and there The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail Comes forth, clammy and bare. Hark! that's the nightingale, Telling the selfsame tale Her song told when this ancient earth was young: So echoes answered when her song was sung In the first wooded vale. We call it love and pain The passion of her strain; And yet we little understand or know: Why should it not be rather joy that so Throbs in each throbbing vein? In separate herds the deer Lie; here the bucks, and here The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn: Through all the hours of night until the dawn They sleep, forgetting fear. The hare sleeps where it lies, With wary half-closed eyes; The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck: Only the fox is out, some heedless duck Or chicken to surprise. Remote, each single star Comes out, till there they are All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp! While close at hand the glow-worm lights her lamp Or twinkles from afar. But evening now is done As much as if the sun Day-giving had arisen in the East: For night has come; and the great calm has ceased, The quiet sands have run. WIFE TO HUSBAND. Pardon the faults in me, For the love of years ago: Good bye. I must drift across the sea, I must sink into the snow, I must die. You can bask in this sun, You can drink wine, and eat: Good bye. I must gird myself and run, Tho' with unready feet: I must die. Blank sea to sail upon, Cold bed to sleep in: Good bye. While you clasp, I must be gone For all your weeping: I must die. A kiss for one friend, And a word for two,— Good bye:— A lock that you must send, A kindness you must do: I must die. Not a word for you, Not a lock or kiss, Good bye. We, one, must part in two; Verily death is this: I must die. THREE SEASONS. “A cup for hope!” she said, In springtime ere the bloom was old: The crimson wine was poor and cold By her mouth's richer red. “A cup for love!” how low, How soft the words; and all the while Her blush was rippling with a smile Like summer after snow. “A cup for memory!” Cold cup that one must drain alone: While autumn winds are up and moan Across the barren sea. Hope, memory, love: Hope for fair morn, and love for day, And memory for the evening grey And solitary dove. MIRAGE. The hope I dreamed of was a dream, Was but a dream; and now I wake Exceeding comfortless, and worn, and old, For a dream's sake. I hang my harp upon a tree, A weeping willow in a lake; I hang my silenced harp there, wrung and snapt For a dream's sake. Lie still, lie still, my breaking heart; My silent heart, lie still and break: Life, and the world, and mine own self, are changed For a dream's sake. SHUT OUT. The door was shut. I looked between Its iron bars; and saw it lie, My garden, mine, beneath the sky, Pied with all flowers bedewed and green: From bough to bough the song-birds crossed, From flower to flower the moths and bees; With all its nests and stately trees It had been mine, and it was lost. A shadowless spirit kept the gate, Blank and unchanging like the grave. I peering thro' said: “Let me have Some buds to cheer my outcast state.” He answered not. “Or give me, then, But one small twig from shrub or tree; And bid my home remember me Until I come to it again.” The spirit was silent; but he took Mortar and stone to build a wall; He left no loophole great or small Thro' which my straining eyes might look: So now I sit here quite alone Blinded with tears; nor grieve for that, For nought is left worth looking at Since my delightful land is gone. A violet bed is budding near, Wherein a lark has made her nest: And good they are, but not the best; And dear they are, but not so dear. SOUND SLEEP. Some are laughing, some are weeping; She is sleeping, only sleeping. Round her rest wild flowers are creeping; There the wind is heaping, heaping Sweetest sweets of Summer's keeping, By the corn fields ripe for reaping. There are lilies, and there blushes The deep rose, and there the thrushes Sing till latest sunlight flushes In the west; a fresh wind brushes Thro' the leaves while evening hushes. There by day the lark is singing And the grass and weeds are springing; There by night the bat is winging; There for ever winds are bringing Far-off chimes of church-bells ringing. Night and morning, noon and even, Their sound fills her dreams with Heaven: The long strife at length is striven: Till her grave-bands shall be riven, Such is the good portion given To her soul at rest and shriven. SONG. [She sat and sang alway] She sat and sang alway By the green margin of a stream, Watching the fishes leap and play Beneath the glad sunbeam. I sat and wept away Beneath the moon's most shadowy beam, Watching the blossoms of the May Weep leaves into the stream. I wept for memory; She sang for hope that is so fair: My tears were swallowed by the sea; Her songs died on the air. SONG. [When I am dead, my dearest] When I am dead, my dearest, Sing no sad songs for me; Plant thou no roses at my head, Nor shady cypress tree: Be the green grass above me With showers and dewdrops wet; And if thou wilt, remember, And if thou wilt, forget. I shall not see the shadows, I shall not feel the rain; I shall not hear the nightingale Sing on, as if in pain: And dreaming through the twilight That doth not rise nor set, Haply I may remember, And haply may forget. DEAD BEFORE DEATH. Ah! changed and cold, how changed and very cold! With stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes: Changed, yet the same; much knowing, little wise; This was the promise of the days of old! Grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould, Grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies: We hoped for better things as years would rise, But it is over as a tale once told. All fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore, All lost the present and the future time, All lost, all lost, the lapse that went before: So lost till death shut-to the opened door, So lost from chime to everlasting chime, So cold and lost for ever evermore. BITTER FOR SWEET. Summer is gone with all its roses, Its sun and perfumes and sweet flowers, Its warm air and refreshing showers: And even Autumn closes. Yea, Autumn's chilly self is going, And Winter comes which is yet colder; Each day the hoar-frost waxes bolder, And the last buds cease blowing. SISTER MAUDE. Who told my mother of my shame, Who told my father of my dear? Oh who but Maude, my sister Maude, Who lurked to spy and peer. Cold he lies, as cold as stone, With his clotted curls about his face: The comeliest corpse in all the world And worthy of a queen's embrace. You might have spared his soul, sister, Have spared my soul, your own soul too: Though I had not been born at all, He'd never have looked at you. My father may sleep in Paradise, My mother at Heaven-gate: But sister Maude shall get no sleep Either early or late. My father may wear a golden gown, My mother a crown may win; If my dear and I knocked at Heaven-gate Perhaps they'd let us in: But sister Maude, oh sister Maude, Bide you with death and sin. REST. O Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes; Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth; Lie close around her; leave no room for mirth With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs. She hath no questions, she hath no replies, Hushed in and curtained with a blessèd dearth Of all that irked her from the hour of birth; With stillness that is almost Paradise. Darkness more clear than noon-day holdeth her, Silence more musical than any song; Even her very heart has ceased to stir: Until the morning of Eternity Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be; And when she wakes she will not think it long. THE FIRST SPRING DAY. I wonder if the sap is stirring yet, If wintry birds are dreaming of a mate, If frozen snowdrops feel as yet the sun And crocus fires are kindling one by one: Sing, robin, sing; I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring. I wonder if the springtide of this year Will bring another Spring both lost and dear; If heart and spirit will find out their Spring, Or if the world alone will bud and sing: Sing, hope, to me; Sweet notes, my hope, soft notes for memory. The sap will surely quicken soon or late, The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate; So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom, Or in this world, or in the world to come: Sing, voice of Spring, Till I too blossom and rejoice and sing. THE CONVENT THRESHOLD. There's blood between us, love, my love, There's father's blood, there's brother's blood; And blood's a bar I cannot pass: I choose the stairs that mount above, Stair after golden skyward stair, To city and to sea of glass. My lily feet are soiled with mud, With scarlet mud which tells a tale Of hope that was, of guilt that was, Of love that shall not yet avail; Alas, my heart, if I could bare My heart, this selfsame stain is there: I seek the sea of glass and fire To wash the spot, to burn the snare; Lo, stairs are meant to lift us higher: Mount with me, mount the kindled stair. Your eyes look earthward, mine look up. I see the far-off city grand, Beyond the hills a watered land, Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand Of mansions where the righteous sup; Who sleep at ease among their trees, Or wake to sing a cadenced hymn With Cherubim and Seraphim; They bore the Cross, they drained the cup, Racked, roasted, crushed, wrenched limb from limb, They the offscouring of the world: The heaven of starry heavens unfurled, The sun before their face is dim. You looking earthward, what see you? Milk-white, wine-flushed among the vines, Up and down leaping, to and fro, Most glad, most full, made strong with wines, Blooming as peaches pearled with dew, Their golden windy hair afloat, Love-music warbling in their throat, Young men and women come and go. You linger, yet the time is short: Flee for your life, gird up your strength To flee; the shadows stretched at length Show that day wanes, that night draws nigh; Flee to the mountain, tarry not. Is this a time for smile and sigh, For songs among the secret trees Where sudden blue birds nest and sport? The time is short and yet you stay: Today while it is called today Kneel, wrestle, knock, do violence, pray; Today is short, tomorrow nigh: Why will you die? why will you die? You sinned with me a pleasant sin: Repent with me, for I repent. Woe's me the lore I must unlearn! Woe's me that easy way we went, So rugged when I would return! How long until my sleep begin, How long shall stretch these nights and days? Surely, clean Angels cry, she prays; She laves her soul with tedious tears: How long must stretch these years and years? I turn from you my cheeks and eyes, My hair which you shall see no more— Alas for joy that went before, For joy that dies, for love that dies. Only my lips still turn to you, My livid lips that cry, Repent. Oh weary life, Oh weary Lent, Oh weary time whose stars are few. How should I rest in Paradise, Or sit on steps of heaven alone? If Saints and Angels spoke of ;ove Should I not answer from my throne: Have pity upon me, ye my friends, For I have heard the sound thereof: Should I not turn with yearning eyes, Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang? Oh save me from a pang in heaven. By all the gifts we took and gave, Repent, repent, and be forgiven: This life is long, but yet it ends; Repent and purge your soul and save: No gladder song the morning stars Upon their birthday morning sang Than Angels sing when one repents. I tell you what I dreamed last night: A spirit with transfigured face Fire-footed clomb an infinite space. I heard his hundred pinions clang, Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang, Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents, Worlds spun upon their rushing cars: He mounted shrieking: “Give me light.” Still light was poured on him, more light; Angels, Archangels he outstripped Exultant in exceeding might, And trod the skirts of Cherubim. Still “Give me light,” he shrieked; and dipped His thirsty face, and drank a sea, Athirst with thirst it could not slake. I saw him, drunk with knowledge, take From aching brows the aureole crown— His locks writhed like a cloven snake— He left his throne to grovel down And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet: For what is knowledge duly weighed? Knowledge is strong, but love is sweet; Yea all the progress he had made Was but to learn that all is small Save love, for love is all in all. I tell you what I dreamed last night: It was not dark, it was not light, Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair Thro' clay; you came to seek me there. And “Do you dream of me?” you said. My heart was dust that used to leap To you; I answered half asleep: “My pillow is damp, my sheets are red, There's a leaden tester to my bed: Find you a warmer playfellow, A warmer pillow for your head, A kinder love to love than mine.” You wrung your hands; while I like lead Crushed downwards thro' the sodden earth: You smote your hands but not in mirth, And reeled but were not drunk with wine. For all night long I dreamed of you: I woke and prayed against my will, Then slept to dream of you again. At length I rose and knelt and prayed: I cannot write the words I said, My words were slow, my tears were few; But thro' the dark my silence spoke Like thunder. When this morning broke, My face was pinched, my hair was grey, And frozen blood was on the sill Where stifling in my struggle I lay. If now you saw me you would say: Where is the face I used to love? And I would answer: Gone before; It tarries veiled in paradise. When once the morning star shall rise, When earth with shadow flees away And we stand safe within the door, Then you shall lift the veil thereof. Look up, rise up: for far above Our palms are grown, our place is set; There we shall meet as once we met And love with old familiar love. UP-HILL. Does the road wind up-hill all the way? Yes, to the very end. Will the day's journey take the whole long day? From morn to night, my friend. But is there for the night a resting-place? A roof for when the slow dark hours begin. May not the darkness hide it from my face? You cannot miss that inn. Shall I meet other wayfarers at night? Those who have gone before. Then must I knock, or call when just in sight? They will not keep you standing at that door. Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak? Of labour you shall find the sum. Will there be beds for me and all who seek? Yea, beds for all who come. “THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSETH KNOWLEDGE.” I bore with thee long weary days and nights, Through many pangs of heart, through many tears; I bore with thee, thy hardness, coldness, slights, For three and thirty years. Who else had dared for thee what I have dared? I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above; I not My flesh, I not My spirit spared: Give thou Me love for love. For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth, For thee I trembled in the nightly frost: Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth: Why wilt thou still be lost? I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced: Men only marked upon My shoulders borne The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced, Or wagged their heads in scorn. Thee did nails grave upon My hands, thy name Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes: I, Holy One, put on thy guilt and shame; I, God, Priest, Sacrifice. A thief upon My right hand and My left; Six hours alone, athirst, in misery: At length in death one smote My heart and cleft A hiding-place for thee. Nailed to the racking cross, than bed of down More dear, whereon to stretch Myself and sleep: So did I win a kingdom,—share My crown; A harvest,—come and reap. “A BRUISED REED SHALL HE NOT BREAK.” I will accept thy will to do and be, Thy hatred and intolerance of sin, Thy will at least to love, that burns within And thirsteth after Me: So will I render fruitful, blessing still The germs and small beginnings in thy heart, Because thy will cleaves to the better part.— Alas, I cannot will. Dost not thou will, poor soul? Yet I receive The inner unseen longings of the soul, I guide them turning towards Me; I control And charm hearts till they grieve: If thou desire, it yet shall come to pass, Tho' thou but wish indeed to choose My love; For I have power in earth and heaven above.— I cannot wish, alas! What, neither choose nor wish to choose? and yet I still must strive to win thee and constrain: For thee I hung upon the cross in pain, How then can I forget? If thou as yet dost neither love, nor hate, Nor choose, nor wish,—resign thyself, be still Till I infuse love, hatred, longing, will.— I do not deprecate. A BETTER RESURRECTION. I have no wit, no words, no tears; My heart within me like a stone Is numbed too much for hopes or fears; Look right, look left, I dwell alone; I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief No everlasting hills I see; My life is in the falling leaf: O Jesus, quicken me. My life is like a faded leaf, My harvest dwindled to a husk; Truly my life is void and brief And tedious in the barren dusk; My life is like a frozen thing, No bud nor greenness can I see: Yet rise it shall—the sap of Spring; O Jesus, rise in me. My life is like a broken bowl, A broken bowl that cannot hold One drop of water for my soul Or cordial in the searching cold; Cast in the fire the perished thing, Melt and remould it, till it be A royal cup for Him my King: O Jesus, drink of me. ADVENT. This Advent moon shines cold and clear, These Advent nights are long; Our lamps have burned year after year And still their flame is strong. “Watchman, what of the night?” we cry Heart-sick with hope deferred: “No speaking signs are in the sky,” Is still the watchman's word. The Porter watches at the gate, The servants watch within; The watch is long betimes and late, The prize is slow to win. “Watchman, what of the night?” but still His answer sounds the same: “No daybreak tops the utmost hill, Nor pale our lamps of flame.” One to another hear them speak The patient virgins wise: “Surely He is not far to seek”— “All night we watch and rise.” “The days are evil looking back, The coming days are dim; Yet count we not His promise slack, But watch and wait for Him.” One with another, soul with soul, They kindle fire from fire: “Friends watch us who have touched the goal.” “They urge us, come up higher.” “With them shall rest our waysore feet, With them is built our home, With Christ.”—“They sweet, but He most sweet, Sweeter than honeycomb.” There no more parting, no more pain, The distant ones brought near, The lost so long are found again, Long lost but longer dear: Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, Nor heart conceived that rest, With them our good things long deferred, With Jesus Christ our Best. We weep because the night is long, We laugh for day shall rise, We sing a slow contented song And knock at Paradise. Weeping we hold Him fast, Who wept For us, we hold Him fast; And will not let Him go except He bless us first or last. Weeping we hold Him fast tonight; We will not let Him go Till daybreak smite our wearied sight And summer smite the snow: Then figs shall bud, and dove with dove Shall coo the livelong day; Then He shall say, “Arise, My love, My fair one, come away.” THE THREE ENEMIES. THE FLESH. “Sweet, thou art pale.” “More pale to see, Christ hung upon the cruel tree And bore His Father's wrath for me.” “Sweet, thou art sad.” “Beneath a rod More heavy, Christ for my sake trod The winepress of the wrath of God.” “Sweet, thou art weary.” “Not so Christ: Whose mighty love of me sufficed For Strength, Salvation, Eucharist.” “Sweet, thou art footsore.” “If I bleed, His feet have bled: yea, in my need His Heart once bled for mine indeed.” THE WORLD. “Sweet, thou art young.” “So He was young Who for my sake in silence hung Upon the Cross with Passion wrung.” “Look, thou art fair.” “He was more fair Than men, Who deigned for me to wear A visage marred beyond compare.” “And thou hast riches.” “Daily bread: All else is His; Who living, dead, For me lacked where to lay His Head.” “And life is sweet.” “It was not so To Him, Whose Cup did overflow With mine unutterable woe.” THE DEVIL. “Thou drinkest deep.” “When Christ would sup He drained the dregs from out my cup: So how should I be lifted up?” “Thou shalt win Glory.” “In the skies, Lord Jesus, cover up mine eyes Lest they should look on vanities.” “Thou shalt have Knowledge.” “Helpless dust, In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust: Answer Thou for me, Wise and Just.” “And Might.”— “Get thee behind me. Lord, Who hast redeemed and not abhorred My soul, oh keep it by Thy Word.” ONE CERTAINTY. Vanity of vanities, the Preacher saith, All things are vanity. The eye and ear Cannot be filled with what they see and hear. Like early dew, or like the sudden breath Of wind, or like the grass that withereth, Is man, tossed to and fro by hope and fear: So little joy hath he, so little cheer, Till all things end in the long dust of death. Today is still the same as yesterday, Tomorrow also even as one of them; And there is nothing new under the sun: Until the ancient race of Time be run, The old thorns shall grow out of the old stem, And morning shall be cold and twilight grey. CHRISTIAN AND JEW. A DIALOGUE. “Oh happy happy land! Angels like rushes stand About the wells of light.”— “Alas, I have not eyes for this fair sight: Hold fast my hand.”— “As in a soft wind, they Bend all one blessed way, Each bowed in his own glory, star with star.”— “I cannot see so far, Here shadows are.”— “White-winged the cherubim, Yet whiter seraphim, Glow white with intense fire of love.”— “Mine eyes are dim: I look in vain above, And miss their hymn.”— “Angels, Archangels cry One to other ceaselessly (I hear them sing) One ‘Holy, Holy, Holy’ to their King.”— “I do not hear them, I.”— “Joy to thee, Paradise,— Garden and goal and nest! Made green for wearied eyes; Much softer than the breast Of mother-dove clad in a rainbow's dyes. “All precious souls are there Most safe, elect by grace, All tears are wiped for ever from their face: Untired in prayer They wait and praise Hidden for a little space. “Boughs of the Living Vine They spread in summer shine Green leaf with leaf: Sap of the Royal Vine it stirs like wine In all both less and chief. “Sing to the Lord, All spirits of all flesh, sing; For He hath not abhorred Our low estate nor scorn'd our offering: Shout to our King.”— “But Zion said: My Lord forgetteth me. Lo, she hath made her bed In dust; forsaken weepeth she Where alien rivers swell the sea. “She laid her body as the ground, Her tender body as the ground to those Who passed; her harpstrings cannot sound In a strange land; discrowned She sits, and drunk with woes.”— “O drunken not with wine, Whose sins and sorrows have fulfilled the sum,— Be not afraid, arise, be no more dumb; Arise, shine, For thy light is come.”— “Can these bones live?”— “God knows: The prophet saw such clothed with flesh and skin, A wind blew on them and life entered in, They shook and rose. Hasten the time, O Lord, blot out their sin, Let life begin.” SWEET DEATH. The sweetest blossoms die. And so it was that, going day by day Unto the Church to praise and pray, And crossing the green churchyard thoughtfully, I saw how on the graves the flowers Shed their fresh leaves in showers, And how their perfume rose up to the sky Before it passed away. The youngest blossoms die. They die and fall and nourish the rich earth From which they lately had their birth; Sweet life, but sweeter death that passeth by And is as though it had not been:— All colours turn to green; The bright hues vanish and the odours fly, The grass hath lasting worth. And youth and beauty die. So be it, O my God, Thou God of truth: Better than beauty and than youth Are Saints and Angels, a glad company; And Thou, O Lord, our Rest and Ease, Art better far than these. Why should we shrink from our full harvest? why Prefer to glean with Ruth? SYMBOLS. I watched a rosebud very long Brought on by dew and sun and shower, Waiting to see the perfect flower: Then, when I thought it should be strong, It opened at the matin hour And fell at evensong. I watched a nest from day to day, A green nest full of pleasant shade, Wherein three speckled eggs were laid: But when they should have hatched in May, The two old birds had grown afraid Or tired, and flew away. Then in my wrath I broke the bough That I had tended so with care, Hoping its scent should fill the air; I crushed the eggs, not heeding how Their ancient promise had been fair: I would have vengeance now. But the dead branch spoke from the sod, And the eggs answered me again: Because we failed dost thou complain? Is thy wrath just? And what if God, Who waiteth for thy fruits in vain, Should also take the rod? “CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD.” Flowers preach to us if we will hear:— The rose saith in the dewy morn: I am most fair; Yet all my loveliness is born Upon a thorn. The poppy saith amid the corn: Let but my scarlet head appear And I am held in scorn; Yet juice of subtle virtue lies Within my cup of curious dyes. The lilies say: Behold how we Preach without words of purity. The violets whisper from the shade Which their own leaves have made: Men scent our fragrance on the air, Yet take no heed Of humble lessons we would read. But not alone the fairest flowers: The merest grass Along the roadside where we pass, Lichen and moss and sturdy weed, Tell of His love who sends the dew, The rain and sunshine too, To nourish one small seed. THE WORLD. By day she wooes me, soft, exceeding fair: But all night as the moon so changeth she; Loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy And subtle serpents gliding in her hair. By day she wooes me to the outer air, Ripe fruits, sweet flowers, and full satiety: But thro' the night, a beast she grins at me, A very monster void of love and prayer. By day she stands a lie: by night she stands In all the naked horror of the truth With pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands. Is this a friend indeed; that I should sell My soul to her, give her my life and youth, Till my feet, cloven too, take hold on hell? A TESTIMONY. I said of laughter: it is vain. Of mirth I said: what profits it? Therefore I found a book, and writ Therein how ease and also pain, How health and sickness, every one Is vanity beneath the sun Man walks in a vain shadow; he Disquieteth himself in vain. The things that were shall be again: The rivers do not fill the sea, But turn back to their secret source; The winds too turn upon their course. Our treasures moth and rust corrupt, Or thieves break thro' and steal, or they Make themselves wings and fly away. One man made merry as he supped, Nor guessed how when that night grew dim His soul would be required of him. We build our houses on the sand Comely withoutside and within; But when the winds and rains begin To beat on them, they cannot stand: They perish, quickly overthrown, Loose from the very basement stone. All things are vanity, I said: Yea vanity of vanities. The rich man dies; and the poor dies: The worm feeds sweetly on the dead. Whate'er thou lackest, keep this trust: All in the end shall have but dust: The one inheritance, which best And worst alike shall find and share: The wicked cease from troubling there, And there the weary be at rest; There all the wisdom of the wise Is vanity of vanities. Man flourishes as a green leaf, And as a leaf doth pass away; Or as a shade that cannot stay And leaves no track, his course is brief: Yet man doth hope and fear and plan Till he is dead:—oh foolish man! Our eyes cannot be satisfied With seeing, nor our ears be filled With hearing: yet we plant and build And buy and make our borders wide; We gather wealth, we gather care, But know not who shall be our heir. Why should we hasten to arise So early, and so late take rest? Our labour is not good; our best Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies: Verily, we sow wind; and we Shall reap the whirlwind, verily. He who hath little shall not lack; He who hath plenty shall decay: Our fathers went; we pass away; Our children follow on our track: So generations fail, and so They are renewed and come and go. The earth is fattened with our dead; She swallows more and doth not cease: Therefore her wine and oil increase And her sheaves are not numberèd; Therefore her plants are green, and all Her pleasant trees lusty and tall. Therefore the maidens cease to sing, And the young men are very sad; Therefore the sowing is not glad, And mournful is the harvesting. Of high and low, of great and small, Vanity is the lot of all. A King dwelt in Jerusalem; He was the wisest man on earth; He had all riches from his birth, And pleasures till he tired of them; Then, having tested all things, he Witnessed that all are vanity. SLEEP AT SEA. Sound the deep waters:— Who shall sound that deep?— Too short the plummet And the watchmen sleep. Some dream of effort Up a toilsome steep; Some dream of pasture grounds For harmless sheep. White shapes flit to and fro From mast to mast; They feel the distant tempest That nears them fast: Great rocks are straight ahead, Great shoals not past; They shout to one another Upon the blast. Oh soft the streams drop music Between the hills, And musical the birds' nests Beside those rills: The nests are types of home Love-hidden from ills, The nests are types of spirits Love-music fills. So dream the sleepers, Each man in his place; The lightning shows the smile Upon each face: The ship is driving, driving, It drives apace: And sleepers smile, and spirits Bewail their case. The lightning glares and reddens Across the skies; It seems but sunset To those sleeping eyes. When did the sun go down On such a wise? From such a sunset When shall day arise? “Wake,” call the spirits: But to heedless ears; They have forgotten sorrows And hopes and fears; They have forgotten perils And smiles and tears; Their dream has held them long, Long years and years. “Wake,” call the spirits again: But it would take A louder summons To bid them awake. Some dream of pleasure For another's sake; Some dream, forgetful Of a lifelong ache. One by one slowly, Ah how sad and slow— Wailing and praying The spirits rise and go: Clear stainless spirits White as white as snow; Pale spirits, wailing For an overthrow. One by one flitting, Like a mournful bird Whose song is tired at last For no mate heard. The loving voice is silent, The useless word; One by one flitting Sick with hope deferred. Driving and driving, The ship drives amain: While swift from mast to mast Shapes flit again, Flit silent as the silence Where men lie slain; Their shadow cast upon the sails Is like a stain. No voice to call the sleepers, No hand to raise: They sleep to death in dreaming Of length of days. Vanity of vanities, The Preacher says: Vanity is the end Of all their ways. FROM HOUSE TO HOME. The first was like a dream thro' summer heat, The second like a tedious numbing swoon, While the half-frozen pulses lagged to beat Beneath a winter moon. “But,” says my friend, “what was this thing and where?” It was a pleasure-place within my soul; An earthly paradise supremely fair That lured me from the goal. The first part was a tissue of hugged lies; The second was its ruin fraught with pain: Why raise the fair delusion to the skies But to be dashed again? My castle stood of white transparent glass Glittering and frail with many a fretted spire, But when the summer sunset came to pass It kindled into fire. My pleasaunce was an undulating green, Stately with trees whose shadows slept below, With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between Like flame or sky or snow. Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease, With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife; All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees Fulfilled their careless life. Wood-pigeons cooed there, stockdoves nestled there, My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit, Their branches spread a city to the air And mice lodged in their root. My heath lay farther off, where lizards lived In strange metallic mail, just spied and gone; Like darted lightnings here and there perceived But no where dwelt upon. Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod And propagate in peace, an uncouth crew, Where velvet-headed rushes rustling nod And spill the morning dew. All caterpillars throve beneath my rule, With snails and slugs in corners out of sight; I never marred the curious sudden stool That perfects in a night. Safe in his excavated gallery The burrowing mole groped on from year to year; No harmless hedgehog curled because of me His prickly back for fear. Ofttimes one like an angel walked with me, With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire, But deep as the unfathomed endless sea Fulfilling my desire: And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair, And sometimes like a sunset glorious red, And sometimes he had wings to scale the air With aureole round his head. We sang our songs together by the way, Calls and recalls and echoes of delight; So communed we together all the day, And so in dreams by night. I have no words to tell what way we walked, What unforgotten path now closed and sealed; I have no words to tell all things we talked, All things that he revealed: This only can I tell: that hour by hour I waxed more feastful, lifted up and glad; I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower, Felt not my friend was sad. “Tomorrow,” once I said to him with smiles: “Tonight,” he answered gravely and was dumb, But pointed out the stones that numbered miles And miles and miles to come. “Not so,” I said: “tomorrow shall be sweet; Tonight is not so sweet as coming days.” Then first I saw that he had turned his feet, Had turned from me his face: Running and flying miles and miles he went, But once looked back to beckon with his hand And cry: “Come home, O love, from banishment: Come to the distant land.”— That night destroyed me like an avalanche; One night turned all my summer back to snow: Next morning not a bird upon my branch, Not a lamb woke below; No bird, no lamb, no living breathing thing; No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn, No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing And fled before that dawn. Azure and sun were starved from heaven above, No dew had fallen but biting frost lay hoar: O love, I knew that I should meet my love, Should find my love no more. “My love no more,” I muttered, stunned with pain: I shed no tear, I wrung no passionate hand, Till something whispered: “You shall meet again, Meet in a distant land.” Then with a cry like famine I arose, I lit my candle, searched from room to room, Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze Swept thro' the blank of gloom. I searched day after day, night after night; Scant change there came to me of night or day: “No more,” I wailed, “no more:” and trimmed my light, And gnashed but did not pray, Until my heart broke and my spirit broke: Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled, fell, And moaned: “It is enough: withhold the stroke. Farewell, O love, farewell.” Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me: One cried: “Our sister, she hath suffered long”— One answered: “Make her see”— One cried: “Oh blessed she who no more pain, Who no more disappointment shall receive”— One answered: “Not so: she must live again; Strengthen thou her to live.” So while I lay entranced a curtain seemed To shrivel with crackling from before my face; Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed And showed a certain place. I saw a vision of a woman, where Night and new morning strive for domination; Incomparably pale, and almost fair, And sad beyond expression. Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem, Were stately like the stars, and yet were tender; Her figure charmed me like a windy stem Quivering and drooped and slender. I stood upon the outer barren ground, She stood on inner ground that budded flowers; While circling in their never-slackening round Danced by the mystic hours. But every flower was lifted on a thorn, And every thorn shot upright from its sands To gall her feet; hoarse laughter pealed in scorn With cruel clapping hands. She bled and wept, yet did not shrink; her strength Was strung up until daybreak of delight: She measured measureless sorrow toward its length, And breadth, and depth, and height. Then marked I how a chain sustained her form, A chain of living links not made nor riven: It stretched sheer up thro' lightning, wind, and storm, And anchored fast in heaven. One cried: “How long? yet founded on the Rock She shall do battle, suffer, and attain”— One answered: “Faith quakes in the tempest shock: Strengthen her soul again.” I saw a cup sent down and come to her Brim full of loathing and of bitterness: She drank with livid lips that seemed to stir The depth, not make it less. But as she drank I spied a hand distil New wine and virgin honey; making it First bitter-sweet, then sweet indeed, until She tasted only sweet. Her lips and cheeks waxed rosy-fresh and young; Drinking she sang: “My soul shall nothing want;” And drank anew: while soft a song was sung, A mystical slow chant. One cried: “The wounds are faithful of a friend: The wilderness shall blossom as a rose”— One answered: “Rend the veil, declare the end, Strengthen her ere she goes.” Then earth and heaven were rolled up like a scroll; Time and space, change and death, had passed away; Weight, number, measure, each had reached its whole; The day had come, that day. Multitudes—multitudes—stood up in bliss, Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair; With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace, And crowned and haloed hair. They sang a song, a new song in the height, Harping with harps to Him Who is Strong and True: They drank new wine, their eyes saw with new light, Lo, all things were made new. Tier beyond tier they rose and rose and rose So high that it was dreadful, flames with flames: No man could number them, no tongue disclose Their secret sacred names. As tho' one pulse stirred all, one rush of blood Fed all, one breath swept thro' them myriad-voiced, They struck their harps, cast down their crowns, they stood And worshipped and rejoiced. Each face looked one way like a moon new-lit, Each face looked one way towards its Sun of Love; Drank love and bathed in love and mirrored it And knew no end thereof. Glory touched glory on each blessed head, Hands locked dear hands never to sunder more: These were the new-begotten from the dead Whom the great birthday bore. Heart answered heart, soul answered soul at rest, Double against each other, filled, sufficed: All loving, loved of all; but loving best And best beloved of Christ. I saw that one who lost her love in pain, Who trod on thorns, who drank the loathsome cup; The lost in night, in day was found again; The fallen was lifted up. They stood together in the blessed noon, They sang together thro' the length of days; Each loving face bent Sunwards like a moon New-lit with love and praise. Therefore, O friend, I would not if I might Rebuild my house of lies, wherein I joyed One time to dwell: my soul shall walk in white, Cast down but not destroyed. Therefore in patience I possess my soul; Yea, therefore as a flint I set my face, To pluck down, to build up again the whole— But in a distant place. These thorns are sharp, yet I can tread on them; This cup is loathsome, yet He makes it sweet: My face is steadfast toward Jerusalem, My heart remembers it. I lift the hanging hands, the feeble knees— I, precious more than seven times molten gold— Until the day when from His storehouses God shall bring new and old; Beauty for ashes, oil of joy for grief, Garment of praise for spirit of heaviness: Altho' today I fade as doth a leaf, I languish and grow less. Altho' today He prunes my twigs with pain, Yet doth His blood nourish and warm my root: Tomorrow I shall put forth buds again And clothe myself with fruit. Altho' today I walk in tedious ways, Today His staff is turned into a rod, Yet will I wait for Him the appointed days And stay upon my God. OLD AND NEW YEAR DITTIES. 1. New Year met me somewhat sad: Old Year leaves me tired, Stripped of favourite things I had, Baulked of much desired: Yet farther on my road today God willing, farther on my way. New Year coming on apace What have you to give me? Bring you scathe, or bring you grace, Face me with an honest face; You shall not deceive me: Be it good or ill, be it what you will, It needs shall help me on my road, My rugged way to heaven, please God. 2. Watch with me, men, women, and children dear, You whom I love, for whom I hope and fear, Watch with me this last vigil of the year. Some hug their business, some their pleasure scheme; Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream; Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart. Watch with me, blessed spirits, who delight All thro' the holy night to walk in white, Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight. I know not if they watch with me: I know They count this eve of resurrection slow, And cry, “How long?” with urgent utterance strong. Watch with me, Jesus, in my loneliness: Tho' others say me nay, yet say Thou yes; Tho' others pass me by, stop Thou to bless. Yea, Thou dost stop with me this vigil night; Tonight of pain, tomorrow of delight: I, Love, am Thine; Thou, Lord my God, art mine. 3. Passing away, saith the World, passing away: Chances, beauty and youth sapped day by day: Thy life never continueth in one stay. Is the eye waxen dim, is the dark hair changing to grey That hath won neither laurel nor bay? I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May: Thou, root-stricken, shalt not rebuild thy decay On my bosom for aye. Then I answered: Yea. Passing away, saith my Soul, passing away: With its burden of fear and hope, of labour and play; Hearken what the past doth witness and say: Rust in thy gold, a moth is in thine array, A canker is in thy bud, thy leaf must decay. At midnight, at cockcrow, at morning, one certain day Lo the bridegroom shall come and shall not delay: Watch thou and pray. Then I answered: Yea. Passing away, saith my God, passing away: Winter passeth after the long delay: New grapes on the vine, new figs on the tender spray, Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May. Tho' I tarry, wait for Me, trust Me, watch and pray. Arise, come away, night is past and lo it is day, My love, My sister, My spouse, thou shalt hear Me say. Then I answered: Yea. AMEN. It is over. What is over? Nay, how much is over truly: Harvest days we toiled to sow for; Now the sheaves are gathered newly, Now the wheat is garnered duly. It is finished. What is finished? Much is finished known or unknown: Lives are finished; time diminished; Was the fallow field left unsown? Will these buds be always unblown? It suffices. What suffices? All suffices reckoned rightly: Spring shall bloom where now the ice is, Roses make the bramble sightly, And the quickening sun shine brightly, And the latter wind blow lightly, And my garden teem with spices. II The Prince's Progress and Other Poems (1866) THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS. Till all sweet gums and juices flow, Till the blossom of blossoms blow, The long hours go and come and go, The bride she sleepeth, waketh, sleepeth, Waiting for one whose coming is slow:— Hark! the bride weepeth. “How long shall I wait, come heat come rime?”— “Till the strong Prince comes, who must come in time” (Her women say), “there's a mountain to climb, A river to ford. Sleep, dream and sleep: Sleep” (they say): “we've muffled the chime, Better dream than weep.” In his world-end palace the strong Prince sat, Taking his ease on cushion and mat, Close at hand lay his staff and his hat. “When wilt thou start? the bride waits, O youth.”— “Now the moon's at full; I tarried for that, Now I start in truth. “But tell me first, true voice of my doom, Of my veiled bride in her maiden bloom; Keeps she watch thro' glare and thro' gloom, Watch for me asleep and awake?”— “Spell-bound she watches in one white room, And is patient for thy sake. “By her head lilies and rosebuds grow; The lilies droop, will the rosebuds blow? The silver slim lilies hang the head low; Their stream is scanty, their sunshine rare; Let the sun blaze out, and let the stream flow, They will blossom and wax fair. “Red and white poppies grow at her feet, The blood-red wait for sweet summer heat, Wrapped in bud-coats hairy and neat; But the white buds swell, one day they will burst, Will open their death-cups drowsy and sweet— Which will open the first?” Then a hundred sad voices lifted a wail, And a hundred glad voices piped on the gale: “Time is short, life is short,” they took up the tale: “Life is sweet, love is sweet, use today while you may; Love is sweet, and tomorrow may fail; Love is sweet, use today.” While the song swept by, beseeching and meek, Up rose the Prince with a flush on his cheek, Up he rose to stir and to seek, Going forth in the joy of his strength; Strong of limb if of purpose weak, Starting at length. Forth he set in the breezy morn, Across green fields of nodding corn, As goodly a Prince as ever was born, Carolling with the carolling lark;— Sure his bride will be won and worn, Ere fall of the dark. So light his step, so merry his smile, A milkmaid loitered beside a stile, Set down her pail and rested awhile, A wave-haired milkmaid, rosy and white; The Prince, who had journeyed at least a mile, Grew athirst at the sight. “Will you give me a morning draught?”— “You're kindly welcome,” she said, and laughed. He lifted the pail, new milk he quaffed; Then wiping his curly black beard like silk: “Whitest cow that ever was calved Surely gave you this milk.” Was it milk now, or was it cream? Was she a maid, or an evil dream? Her eyes began to glitter and gleam; He would have gone, but he stayed instead; Green they gleamed as he looked in them: “Give me my fee,” she said.— “I will give you a jewel of gold.”— “Not so; gold is heavy and cold.”— “I will give you a velvet fold Of foreign work your beauty to deck.”— “Better I like my kerchief rolled Light and white round my neck.”— “Nay,” cried he, “but fix your own fee.”— She laughed, “You may give the full moon to me; Or else sit under this apple-tree Here for one idle day by my side; After that I'll let you go free, And the world is wide.” Loth to stay, yet to leave her slack, He half turned away, then he quite turned back: For courtesy's sake he could not lack To redeem his own royal pledge; Ahead too the windy heaven lowered black With a fire-cloven edge. So he stretched his length in the apple-tree shade, Lay and laughed and talked to the maid, Who twisted her hair in a cunning braid And writhed it in shining serpent-coils, And held him a day and night fast laid In her subtle toils. At the death of night and the birth of day, When the owl left off his sober play, And the bat hung himself out of the way, Woke the song of mavis and merle, And heaven put off its hodden grey For mother-o'-pearl. Peeped up daisies here and there, Here, there, and everywhere; Rose a hopeful lark in the air, Spreading out towards the sun his breast; While the moon set solemn and fair Away in the West. “Up, up, up,” called the watchman lark, In his clear réveillée: “Hearken, oh hark! Press to the high goal, fly to the mark. Up, O sluggard, new morn is born; If still asleep when the night falls dark, Thou must wait a second morn.” “Up, up, up,” sad glad voices swelled: “So the tree falls and lies as it's felled. Be thy bands loosed, O sleeper, long held In sweet sleep whose end is not sweet. Be the slackness girt and the softness quelled And the slowness fleet.” Off he set. The grass grew rare, A blight lurked in the darkening air, The very moss grew hueless and spare, The last daisy stood all astunt; Behind his back the soil lay bare, But barer in front. A land of chasm and rent, a land Of rugged blackness on either hand: If water trickled its track was tanned With an edge of rust to the chink; If one stamped on stone or on sand It returned a clink. A lifeless land, a loveless land, Without lair or nest on either hand: Only scorpions jerked in the sand, Black as black iron, or dusty pale; From point to point sheer rock was manned By scorpions in mail. A land of neither life nor death, Where no man buildeth or fashioneth, Where none draws living or dying breath; No man cometh or goeth there, No man doeth, seeketh, saith, In the stagnant air. Some old volcanic upset must Have rent the crust and blackened the crust; Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust Above earth's molten centre at seethe, Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust Of fire beneath. Untrodden before, untrodden since: Tedious land for a social Prince; Halting, he scanned the outs and ins, Endless, labyrinthine, grim, Of the solitude that made him wince, Laying wait for him. By bulging rock and gaping cleft, Even of half mere daylight reft, Rueful he peered to right and left, Muttering in his altered mood: “The fate is hard that weaves my weft, Tho' my lot be good.” Dim the changes of day to night, Of night scarce dark to day not bright. Still his road wound towards the right, Still he went, and still he went, Till one night he spied a light, In his discontent. Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave, Like a red-hot eye from a grave. No man stood there of whom to crave Rest for wayfarer plodding by: Tho' the tenant were churl or knave The Prince might try. In he passed and tarried not, Groping his way from spot to spot, Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:— An old, old mortal, cramped and double, Was peering into a seething-pot, In a world of trouble. The veriest atomy he looked, With grimy fingers clutching and crooked, Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked, And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way; Blinking, his eyes had scarcely brooked The light of day. Stared the Prince, for the sight was new; Stared, but asked without more ado: “May a weary traveller lodge with you, Old father, here in your lair? In your country the inns seem few, And scanty the fare.” The head turned not to hear him speak; The old voice whistled as thro' a leak (Out it came in a quavering squeak): “Work for wage is a bargain fit: If there's aught of mine that you seek You must work for it. “Buried alive from light and air This year is the hundredth year, I feed my fire with a sleepless care, Watching my potion wane or wax: Elixir of Life is simmering there, And but one thing lacks. “If you're fain to lodge here with me, Take that pair of bellows you see— Too heavy for my old hands they be— Take the bellows and puff and puff: When the steam curls rosy and free The broth's boiled enough. “Then take your choice of all I have; I will give you life if you crave. Already I'm mildewed for the grave, So first myself I must drink my fill: But all the rest may be yours, to save Whomever you will.” “Done,” quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood. First he piled on resinous wood, Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood; Thinking, “My love and I will live. If I tarry, why life is good, And she may forgive.” The pot began to bubble and boil; The old man cast in essence and oil, He stirred all up with a triple coil Of gold and silver and iron wire, Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil, And fed the fire. But still the steam curled watery white; Night turned to day and day to night; One thing lacked, by his feeble sight Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind: Life might miss him, but Death the blight Was sure to find. So when the hundredth year was full The thread was cut and finished the school. Death snapped the old worn-out tool, Snapped him short while he stood and stirred (Tho' stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule) With never a word. Thus at length the old crab was nipped. The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped In the broth as the dead man slipped,— That same instant, a rosy red Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped Round the dead old head. The last ingredient was supplied (Unless the dead man mistook or lied). Up started the Prince, he cast aside The bellows plied thro' the tedious trial, Made sure that his host had died, And filled a phial. “One night's rest,” thought the Prince: “This done, Forth I speed with the rising sun: With the morrow I rise and run, Come what will of wind or of weather. This draught of Life when my Bride is won We'll drink together.” Thus the dead man stayed in his grave, Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave; There he stayed, were he fool or knave, Or honest seeker who had not found: While the Prince outside was prompt to crave Sleep on the ground. “If she watches, go bid her sleep; Bid her sleep, for the road is steep: He can sleep who holdeth her cheap, Sleep and wake and sleep again. Let him sow, one day he shall reap, Let him sow the grain. “When there blows a sweet garden rose, Let it bloom and wither if no man knows: But if one knows when the sweet thing blows, Knows, and lets it open and drop, If but a nettle his garden grows He hath earned the crop.” Thro' his sleep the summons rang, Into his ears it sobbed and it sang. Slow he woke with a drowsy pang, Shook himself without much debate, Turned where he saw green branches hang, Started tho' late. For the black land was travelled o'er, He should see the grim land no more. A flowering country stretched before His face when the lovely day came back: He hugged the phial of Life he bore, And resumed his track. By willow courses he took his path, Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath, Marked the fields green to aftermath, Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran, Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath, Yawned for a fellow-man. Up on the hills not a soul in view, In the vale not many nor few; Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new. It's oh for a second maiden, at least, To bear the flagon, and taste it too, And flavour the feast. Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve; Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve. At length the water-bed took a curve, The deep river swept its bankside bare; Waters streamed from the hill-reserve— Waters here, waters there. High above, and deep below, Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow, Like hill-torrents after the snow,— Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife, Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,— He must swim for his life. Which way?—which way?—his eyes grew dim With the dizzying whirl—which way to swim? The thunderous downshoot deafened him; Half he choked in the lashing spray: Life is sweet, and the grave is grim— Which way?—which way? A flash of light, a shout from the strand: “This way—this way; here lies the land!” His phial clutched in one drowning hand; He catches—misses—catches a rope; His feet slip on the slipping sand: Is there life?—is there hope? Just saved, without pulse or breath,— Scarcely saved from the gulp of death; Laid where a willow shadoweth— Laid where a swelling turf is smooth. (O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth For all thy sweet youth.) Kind hands do and undo, Kind voices whisper and coo: “I will chafe his hands”—“And I”—“And you Raise his head, put his hair aside.” (If many laugh, one well may rue: Sleep on, thou Bride.) So the Prince was tended with care: One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair; Two chafed his hands, and did not spare; But one propped his head that drooped awry: Till his eyes oped, and at unaware They met eye to eye. Oh a moon face in a shadowy place, And a light touch and a winsome grace, And a thrilling tender voice which says: “Safe from waters that seek the sea— Cold waters by rugged ways— Safe with me.” While overhead bird whistles to bird, And round about plays a gamesome herd: “Safe with us”—some take up the word— “Safe with us, dear lord and friend: All the sweeter if long deferred Is rest in the end.” Had he stayed to weigh and to scan, He had been more or less than a man: He did what a young man can, Spoke of toil and an arduous way— Toil tomorrow, while golden ran The sands of today. Slip past, slip fast, Uncounted hours from first to last, Many hours till the last is past, Many hours dwindling to one— One hour whose die is cast, One last hour gone. Come, gone—gone for ever— Gone as an unreturning river— Gone as to death the merriest liver— Gone as the year at the dying fall— Tomorrow, today, yesterday, never— Gone once for all. Came at length the starting-day, With last words, and last, last words to say, With bodiless cries from far away— Chiding wailing voices that rang Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray; And thus they sang: “Is there life?—the lamp burns low; Is there hope?—the coming is slow: The promise promised so long ago, The long promise, has not been kept. Does she live?—does she die?—she slumbers so Who so oft has wept. “Does she live?—does she die?—she languisheth As a lily drooping to death, As a drought-worn bird with failing breath, As a lovely vine without a stay, As a tree whereof the owner saith, ‘Hew it down today.’” Stung by that word the Prince was fain To start on his tedious road again. He crossed the stream where a ford was plain, He clomb the opposite bank tho' steep, And swore to himself to strain and attain Ere he tasted sleep. Huge before him a mountain frowned With foot of rock on the valley ground, And head with snows incessant crowned, And a cloud mantle about its strength, And a path which the wild goat hath not found In its breadth and length. But he was strong to do and dare: If a host had withstood him there, He had braved a host with little care In his lusty youth and his pride, Tough to grapple tho' weak to snare. He comes, O Bride. Up he went where the goat scarce clings, Up where the eagle folds her wings, Past the green line of living things, Where the sun cannot warm the cold,— Up he went as a flame enrings Where there seems no hold. Up a fissure barren and black, Till the eagles tired upon his track, And the clouds were left behind his back, Up till the utmost peak was past. Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack; He paused at last. Before his face a valley spread Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread, Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed, Where all birds made love to their kind, Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red And not hard to find. Midway down the mountain side (On its green slope the path was wide) Stood a house for a royal bride, Built all of changing opal stone, The royal palace, till now descried In his dreams alone. Less bold than in days of yore, Doubting now tho' never before, Doubting he goes and lags the more: Is the time late? does the day grow dim? Rose, will she open the crimson core Of her heart to him? Above his head a tangle glows Of wine-red roses, blushes, snows, Closed buds and buds that unclose, Leaves, and moss, and prickles too; His hand shook as he plucked a rose, And the rose dropped dew. Take heart of grace! the potion of Life May go far to woo him a wife: If she frown, yet a lover's strife Lightly raised can be laid again: A hasty word is never the knife To cut love in twain. Far away stretched the royal land, Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned: Light labour more, and his foot would stand On the threshold, all labour done; Easy pleasure laid at his hand, And the dear Bride won. His slackening steps pause at the gate— Does she wake or sleep?—the time is late— Does she sleep now, or watch and wait? She has watched, she has waited long, Watching athwart the golden grate With a patient song. Fling the golden portals wide, The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride; Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside, Let them look on each other's face, She in her meekness, he in his pride— Day wears apace. Day is over, the day that wore. What is this that comes thro' the door, The face covered, the feet before? This that coming takes his breath; This Bride not seen, to be seen no more Save of Bridegroom Death? Veiled figures carrying her Sweep by yet make no stir; There is a smell of spice and myrrh, A bride-chant burdened with one name; The bride-song rises steadier Than the torches' flame: “Too late for love, too late for joy, Too late, too late! You loitered on the road too long, You trifled at the gate: The enchanted dove upon her branch Died without a mate; The enchanted princess in her tower Slept, died, behind the grate; Her heart was starving all this while You made it wait. “Ten years ago, five years ago, One year ago, Even then you had arrived in time, Tho' somewhat slow; Then you had known her living face Which now you cannot know: The frozen fountain would have leaped, The buds gone on to blow, The warm south wind would have awaked To melt the snow. “Is she fair now as she lies? Once she was fair; Meet queen for any kingly king, With gold-dust on her hair. Now these are poppies in her locks, White poppies she must wear; Must wear a veil to shroud her face And the want graven there: Or is the hunger fed at length, Cast off the care? “We never saw her with a smile Or with a frown; Her bed seemed never soft to her, Tho' tossed of down; She little heeded what she wore, Kirtle, or wreath, or gown; We think her white brows often ached Beneath her crown, Till silvery hairs showed in her locks That used to be so brown. “We never heard her speak in haste: Her tones were sweet, And modulated just so much As it was meet: Her heart sat silent thro' the noise And concourse of the street. There was no hurry in her hands, No hurry in her feet; There was no bliss drew nigh to her, That she might run to greet. “You should have wept her yesterday, Wasting upon her bed: But wherefore should you weep today That she is dead? Lo, we who love weep not today, But crown her royal head. Let be these poppies that we strew, Your roses are too red: Let be these poppies, not for you Cut down and spread.” MAIDEN-SONG. Long ago and long ago, And long ago still, There dwelt three merry maidens Upon a distant hill. One was tall Meggan, And one was dainty May, But one was fair Margaret, More fair than I can say, Long ago and long ago. When Meggan plucked the thorny rose, And when May pulled the brier, Half the birds would swoop to see, Half the beasts draw nigher; Half the fishes of the streams Would dart up to admire: But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower, Or poppy hot aflame, All the beasts and all the birds And all the fishes came To her hand more soft than snow. Strawberry leaves and May-dew In brisk morning air, Strawberry leaves and May-dew Make maidens fair. “I go for strawberry leaves,” Meggan said one day: “Fair Margaret can bide at home, But you come with me, May; Up the hill and down the hill, Along the winding way You and I are used to go.” So these two fair sisters Went with innocent will Up the hill and down again, And round the homestead hill: While the fairest sat at home, Margaret like a queen, Like a blush-rose, like the moon In her heavenly sheen, Fragrant-breathed as milky cow Or field of blossoming bean, Graceful as an ivy bough Born to cling and lean; Thus she sat to sing and sew. When she raised her lustrous eyes A beast peeped at the door; When she downward cast her eyes A fish gasped on the floor; When she turned away her eyes A bird perched on the sill, Warbling out its heart of love, Warbling warbling still, With pathetic pleadings low. Light-foot May with Meggan Sought the choicest spot, Clothed with thyme-alternate grass: Then, while day waxed hot, Sat at ease to play and rest, A gracious rest and play; The loveliest maidens near or far, When Margaret was away, Who sat at home to sing and sew. Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks, Wind-play tossed their hair, Creeping things among the grass Stroked them here and there; Meggan piped a merry note, A fitful wayward lay, While shrill as bird on topmost twig Piped merry May; Honey-smooth the double flow. Sped a herdsman from the vale, Mounting like a flame, All on fire to hear and see, With floating locks he came. Looked neither north nor south, Neither east nor west, But sat him down at Meggan's feet As love-bird on his nest, And wooed her with a silent awe, With trouble not expressed; She sang the tears into his eyes, The heart out of his breast: So he loved her, listening so. She sang the heart out of his breast, The words out of his tongue; Hand and foot and pulse he paused Till her song was sung. Then he spoke up from his place Simple words and true: “Scanty goods have I to give, Scanty skill to woo; But I have a will to work, And a heart for you: Bid me stay or bid me go.” Then Meggan mused within herself: “Better be first with him, Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits, Who shines my brightness dim, For ever second where she sits, However fair I be: I will be lady of his love, And he shall worship me; I will be lady of his herds And stoop to his degree, At home where kids and fatlings grow.” Sped a shepherd from the height Headlong down to look, (White lambs followed, lured by love Of their shepherd's crook): He turned neither east nor west, Neither north nor south, But knelt right down to May, for love Of her sweet-singing mouth; Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks In parching hill-side drouth; Forgot himself for weal or woe. Trilled her song and swelled her song With maiden coy caprice In a labyrinth of throbs, Pauses, cadences; Clear-noted as a dropping brook, Soft-noted like the bees, Wild-noted as the shivering wind Forlorn thro' forest trees: Love-noted like the wood-pigeon Who hides herself for love, Yet cannot keep her secret safe, But cooes and cooes thereof: Thus the notes rang loud or low. He hung breathless on her breath; Speechless, who listened well; Could not speak or think or wish Till silence broke the spell. Then he spoke, and spread his hands, Pointing here and there: “See my sheep and see the lambs, Twin lambs which they bare. All myself I offer you, All my flocks and care, Your sweet song hath moved me so.” In her fluttered heart young May Mused a dubious while: “If he loves me as he says”— Her lips curved with a smile: “Where Margaret shines like the sun I shine but like a moon; If sister Meggan makes her choice I can make mine as soon; At cockcrow we were sister-maids, We may be brides at noon.” Said Meggan, “Yes;” May said not “No.” Fair Margaret stayed alone at home, Awhile she sang her song, Awhile sat silent, then she thought: “My sisters loiter long.” That sultry noon had waned away, Shadows had waxen great: “Surely,” she thought within herself, “My sisters loiter late.” She rose, and peered out at the door, With patient heart to wait, And heard a distant nightingale Complaining of its mate; Then down the garden slope she walked, Down to the garden gate, Leaned on the rail and waited so. The slope was lightened by her eyes Like summer lightning fair, Like rising of the haloed moon Lightened her glimmering hair, While her face lightened like the sun Whose dawn is rosy white. Thus crowned with maiden majesty She peered into the night, Looked up the hill and down the hill, To left hand and to right, Flashing like fire-flies to and fro. Waiting thus in weariness She marked the nightingale Telling, if any one would heed, Its old complaining tale. Then lifted she her voice and sang, Answering the bird: Then lifted she her voice and sang, Such notes were never heard From any bird where Spring's in blow. The king of all that country Coursing far, coursing near, Curbed his amber-bitted steed, Coursed amain to hear; All his princes in his train, Squire, and knight, and peer, With his crown upon his head, His sceptre in his hand, Down he fell at Margaret's knees Lord king of all that land, To her highness bending low. Every beast and bird and fish Came mustering to the sound, Every man and every maid From miles of country round: Meggan on her herdsman's arm, With her shepherd May, Flocks and herds trooped at their heels Along the hill-side way; No foot too feeble for the ascent, Not any head too grey; Some were swift and none were slow. So Margaret sang her sisters home In their marriage mirth; Sang free birds out of the sky, Beasts along the earth, Sang up fishes of the deep— All breathing things that move Sang from far and sang from near To her lovely love; Sang together friend and foe; Sang a golden-bearded king Straightway to her feet, Sang him silent where he knelt In eager anguish sweet. But when the clear voice died away, When longest echoes died, He stood up like a royal man And claimed her for his bride. So three maids were wooed and won In a brief May-tide, Long ago and long ago. JESSIE CAMERON. “Jessie, Jessie Cameron, Hear me but this once,” quoth he. “Good luck go with you, neighbour's son, But I'm no mate for you,” quoth she. Day was verging toward the night There beside the moaning sea, Dimness overtook the light There where the breakers be. “O Jessie, Jessie Cameron, I have loved you long and true.”— “Good luck go with you, neighbour's son, But I'm no mate for you.” She was a careless, fearless girl, And made her answer plain, Outspoken she to earl or churl, Kindhearted in the main, But somewhat heedless with her tongue And apt at causing pain; A mirthful maiden she and young, Most fair for bliss or bane. “Oh long ago I told you so, I tell you so today: Go you your way, and let me go Just my own free way.” The sea swept in with moan and foam Quickening the stretch of sand; They stood almost in sight of home; He strove to take her hand. “Oh can't you take your answer then, And won't you understand? For me you're not the man of men, I've other plans are planned. You're good for Madge, or good for Cis, Or good for Kate, may be: But what's to me the good of this While you're not good for me?” They stood together on the beach, They two alone, And louder waxed his urgent speech, His patience almost gone: “Oh say but one kind word to me, Jessie, Jessie Cameron.”— “I'd be too proud to beg,” quoth she, And pride was in her tone. And pride was in her lifted head, And in her angry eye, And in her foot, which might have fled, But would not fly. Some say that he had gipsy blood, That in his heart was guile: Yet he had gone thro' fire and flood Only to win her smile. Some say his grandam was a witch, A black witch from beyond the Nile, Who kept an image in a niche And talked with it the while. And by her hut far down the lane Some say they would not pass at night, Lest they should hear an unked strain Or see an unked sight. Alas for Jessie Cameron!— The sea crept moaning, moaning nigher: She should have hastened to begone,— The sea swept higher, breaking by her: She should have hastened to her home While yet the west was flushed with fire, But now her feet are in the foam, The sea-foam sweeping higher. O mother, linger at your door, And light your lamp to make it plain; But Jessie she comes home no more, No more again. They stood together on the strand, They only each by each; Home, her home, was close at hand, Utterly out of reach. Her mother in the chimney nook Heard a startled sea-gull screech, But never turned her head to look Towards the darkening beach: Neighbours here and neighbours there Heard one scream, as if a bird Shrilly screaming cleft the air:— That was all they heard. Jessie she comes home no more, Comes home never; Her lover's step sounds at his door No more for ever. And boats may search upon the sea And search along the river, But none know where the bodies be: Sea-winds that shiver, Sea-birds that breast the blast, Sea-waves swelling, Keep the secret first and last Of their dwelling. Whether the tide so hemmed them round With its pitiless flow, That when they would have gone they found No way to go; Whether she scorned him to the last With words flung to and fro, Or clung to him when hope was past, None will ever know: Whether he helped or hindered her, Threw up his life or lost it well, The troubled sea for all its stir Finds no voice to tell. Only watchers by the dying Have thought they heard one pray Wordless, urgent; and replying One seem to say him nay: And watchers by the dead have heard A windy swell from miles away, With sobs and screams, but not a word Distinct for them to say: And watchers out at sea have caught Glimpse of a pale gleam here or there, Come and gone as quick as thought, Which might be hand or hair. SPRING QUIET. Gone were but the Winter, Come were but the Spring, I would go to a covert Where the birds sing; Where in the whitethorn Singeth a thrush, And a robin sings In the holly-bush. Full of fresh scents Are the budding boughs Arching high over A cool green house: Full of sweet scents, And whispering air Which sayeth softly: “We spread no snare; “Here dwell in safety, Here dwell alone, With a clear stream And a mossy stone. “Here the sun shineth Most shadily; Here is heard an echo Of the far sea, Tho' far off it be.” THE POOR GHOST. “Oh whence do you come, my dear friend, to me, With your golden hair all fallen below your knee, And your face as white as snowdrops on the lea, And your voice as hollow as the hollow sea?” “From the other world I come back to you, My locks are uncurled with dripping drenching dew. You know the old, whilst I know the new: But tomorrow you shall know this too.” “Oh not tomorrow into the dark, I pray; Oh not tomorrow, too soon to go away: Here I feel warm and well-content and gay: Give me another year, another day.” “Am I so changed in a day and a night That mine own only love shrinks from me with fright, Is fain to turn away to left or right And cover up his eyes from the sight?” “Indeed I loved you, my chosen friend, I loved you for life, but life has an end; Thro' sickness I was ready to tend: But death mars all, which we cannot mend. “Indeed I loved you; I love you yet If you will stay where your bed is set, Where I have planted a violet Which the wind waves, which the dew makes wet.” “Life is gone, then love too is gone, It was a reed that I leant upon: Never doubt I will leave you alone And not wake you rattling bone with bone. “I go home alone to my bed, Dug deep at the foot and deep at the head, Roofed in with a load of lead, Warm enough for the forgotten dead. “But why did your tears soak thro' the clay, And why did your sobs wake me where I lay? I was away, far enough away: Let me sleep now till the Judgment Day.” A PORTRAIT. I She gave up beauty in her tender youth, Gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways; She covered up her eyes lest they should gaze On vanity, and chose the bitter truth. Harsh towards herself, towards others full of ruth, Servant of servants, little known to praise, Long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days: She schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth That with the poor and stricken she might make A home, until the least of all sufficed Her wants; her own self learned she to forsake, Counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss. So with calm will she chose and bore the cross And hated all for love of Jesus Christ. II They knelt in silent anguish by her bed, And could not weep; but calmly there she lay; All pain had left her; and the sun's last ray Shone through upon her, warming into red The shady curtains. In her heart she said: “Heaven opens; I leave these and go away; The Bridegroom calls,—shall the Bride seek to stay?” Then low upon her breast she bowed her head. O lily flower, O gem of priceless worth, O dove with patient voice and patient eyes, O fruitful vine amid a land of dearth, O maid replete with loving purities, Thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth To raise it with the saints in Paradise. DREAM-LOVE. Young Love lies sleeping In May-time of the year, Among the lilies, Lapped in the tender light: White lambs come grazing, White doves come building there; And round about him The May-bushes are white. Soft moss the pillow For oh, a softer cheek; Broad leaves cast shadow Upon the heavy eyes: There winds and waters Grow lulled and scarcely speak; There twilight lingers The longest in the skies. Young Love lies dreaming; But who shall tell the dream? A perfect sunlight On rustling forest tips; Or perfect moonlight Upon a rippling stream; Or perfect silence, Or song of cherished lips. Burn odours round him To fill the drowsy air; Weave silent dances Around him to and fro; For oh, in waking The sights are not so fair, And song and silence Are not like these below. Young Love lies dreaming Till summer days are gone,— Dreaming and drowsing Away to perfect sleep: He sees the beauty Sun hath not looked upon, And tastes the fountain Unutterably deep. Him perfect music Doth hush unto his rest, And thro' the pauses The perfect silence calms: Oh poor the voices Of earth from east to west, And poor earth's stillness Between her stately palms. Young Love lies drowsing Away to poppied death; Cool shadows deepen Across the sleeping face: So fails the summer With warm, delicious breath; And what hath autumn To give us in its place? Draw close the curtains Of branched evergreen; Change cannot touch them With fading fingers sere: Here the first violets Perhaps will bud unseen, And a dove, may be, Return to nestle here. TWICE. I took my heart in my hand (O my love, O my love), I said: Let me fall or stand, Let me live or die, But this once hear me speak— (O my love, O my love)— Yet a woman's words are weak; You should speak, not I. You took my heart in your hand With a friendly smile, With a critical eye you scanned, Then set it down, And said: It is still unripe, Better wait awhile; Wait while the skylarks pipe, Till the corn grows brown. As you set it down it broke— Broke, but I did not wince; I smiled at the speech you spoke, At your judgment that I heard: But I have not often smiled Since then, nor questioned since, Nor cared for corn-flowers wild, Nor sung with the singing bird. I take my heart in my hand, O my God, O my God, My broken heart in my hand: Thou hast seen, judge Thou. My hope was written on sand, O my God, O my God; Now let Thy judgment stand— Yea, judge me now. This contemned of a man, This marred one heedless day, This heart take Thou to scan Both within and without: Refine with fire its gold, Purge Thou its dross away— Yea hold it in Thy hold, Whence none can pluck it out. I take my heart in my hand— I shall not die, but live— Before Thy face I stand; I, for Thou callest such: All that I have I bring, All that I am I give, Smile Thou and I shall sing, But shall not question much. SONGS IN A CORNFIELD. A song in a cornfield Where corn begins to fall, Where reapers are reaping, Reaping one, reaping all. Sing pretty Lettice, Sing Rachel, sing May; Only Marian cannot sing While her sweetheart's away. Where is he gone to And why does he stay? He came across the green sea But for a day, Across the deep green sea To help with the hay. His hair was curly yellow And his eyes were grey, He laughed a merry laugh And said a sweet say. Where is he gone to That he comes not home? Today or tomorrow He surely will come. Let him haste to joy Lest he lag for sorrow, For one weeps today Who'll not weep tomorrow: Today she must weep For gnawing sorrow, Tonight she may sleep And not wake tomorrow. May sang with Rachel In the waxing warm weather, Lettice sang with them, They sang all together:— “Take the wheat in your arm Whilst day is broad above, Take the wheat to your bosom, But not a false false love. Out in the fields Summer heat gloweth, Out in the fields Summer wind bloweth, Out in the fields Summer friend showeth, Out in the fields Summer wheat groweth: But in the winter When summer heat is dead And summer wind has veered And summer friend has fled, Only summer wheat remaineth, White cakes and bread. Take the wheat, clasp the wheat That's food for maid and dove; Take the wheat to your bosom, But not a false false love.” A silence of full noontide heat Grew on them at their toil: The farmer's dog woke up from sleep, The green snake hid her coil Where grass stood thickest: bird and beast Sought shadows as they could, The reaping men and women paused And sat down where they stood; They ate and drank and were refreshed, For rest from toil is good. While the reapers took their ease, Their sickles lying by, Rachel sang a second strain, And singing seemed to sigh:— “There goes the swallow— Could we but follow! Hasty swallow stay, Point us out the way; Look back swallow, turn back swallow, stop swallow. “There went the swallow— Too late to follow: Lost our note of way, Lost our chance today; Good bye swallow, sunny swallow, wise swallow. “After the swallow All sweet things follow: All things go their way, Only we must stay, Must not follow; good bye swallow, good swallow.” Then listless Marian raised her head Among the nodding sheaves; Her voice was sweeter than that voice; She sang like one who grieves: Her voice was sweeter than its wont Among the nodding sheaves; All wondered while they heard her sing Like one who hopes and grieves:— “Deeper than the hail can smite, Deeper than the frost can bite, Deep asleep thro' day and night, Our delight. “Now thy sleep no pang can break, No tomorrow bid thee wake, Not our sobs who sit and ache For thy sake. “Is it dark or light below? Oh but is it cold like snow? Dost thou feel the green things grow Fast or slow? “Is it warm or cold beneath, Oh but is it cold like death? Cold like death, without a breath, Cold like death?” If he comes today He will find her weeping; If he comes tomorrow He will find her sleeping; If he comes the next day He'll not find her at all, He may tear his curling hair, Beat his breast and call. A YEAR'S WINDFALLS. On the wind of January Down flits the snow, Travelling from the frozen North As cold as it can blow. Poor robin redbreast, Look where he comes; Let him in to feel your fire, And toss him of your crumbs. On the wind in February Snowflakes float still, Half inclined to turn to rain, Nipping, dripping, chill. Then the thaws swell the streams, And swollen rivers swell the sea:— If the winter ever ends How pleasant it will be. In the wind of windy March The catkins drop down, Curly, caterpillar-like, Curious green and brown. With concourse of nest-building birds And leaf-buds by the way, We begin to think of flowers And life and nuts some day. With the gusts of April Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall, On the hedged-in orchard-green, From the southern wall. Apple trees and pear trees Shed petals white or pink, Plum trees and peach trees; While sharp showers sink and sink. Little brings the May breeze Beside pure scent of flowers, While all things wax and nothing wanes In lengthening daylight hours. Across the hyacinth beds The wind lags warm and sweet, Across the hawthorn tops, Across the blades of wheat. In the wind of sunny June Thrives the red-rose crop, Every day fresh blossoms blow While the first leaves drop; White rose and yellow rose And moss rose choice to find, And the cottage cabbage rose Not one whit behind. On the blast of scorched July Drives the pelting hail, From thunderous lightning-clouds, that blot Blue heaven grown lurid-pale. Weedy waves are tossed ashore, Sea-things strange to sight Gasp upon the barren shore And fade away in light. In the parching August wind Cornfields bow the head, Sheltered in round valley depths, On low hills outspread. Early leaves drop loitering down Weightless on the breeze, Firstfruits of the year's decay From the withering trees. In brisk wind of September The heavy-headed fruits Shake upon their bending boughs And drop from the shoots; Some glow golden in the sun, Some show green and streaked, Some set forth a purple bloom, Some blush rosy-cheeked. In strong blast of October At the equinox, Stirred up in his hollow bed Broad ocean rocks; Plunge the ships on his bosom, Leaps and plunges the foam,— It's oh! for mothers' sons at sea, That they were safe at home. In slack wind of November The fog forms and shifts; All the world comes out again When the fog lifts. Loosened from their sapless twigs Leaves drop with every gust; Drifting, rustling, out of sight In the damp or dust. Last of all, December, The year's sands nearly run, Speeds on the shortest day, Curtails the sun; With its bleak raw wind Lays the last leaves low, Brings back the nightly frosts, Brings back the snow. THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. How comes it, Flora, that, whenever we Play cards together, you invariably, However the pack parts, Still hold the Queen of Hearts? I've scanned you with a scrutinizing gaze, Resolved to fathom these your secret ways: But, sift them as I will, Your ways are secret still. I cut and shuffle; shuffle, cut, again; But all my cutting, shuffling, proves in vain: Vain hope, vain forethought too; That Queen still falls to you. I dropped her once, prepense; but, ere the deal Was dealt, your instinct seemed her loss to feel: “There should be one card more,” You said, and searched the floor. I cheated once; I made a private notch In Heart-Queen's back, and kept a lynx-eyed watch; Yet such another back Deceived me in the pack: The Queen of Clubs assumed by arts unknown An imitative dint that seemed my own; This notch, not of my doing, Misled me to my ruin. It baffles me to puzzle out the clue, Which must be skill, or craft, or luck in you: Unless, indeed, it be Natural affinity. ONE DAY. I will tell you when they met: In the limpid days of Spring; Elder boughs were budding yet, Oaken boughs looked wintry still, But primrose and veined violet In the mossful turf were set, While meeting birds made haste to sing And build with right good will. I will tell you when they parted: When plenteous Autumn sheaves were brown, Then they parted heavy-hearted; The full rejoicing sun looked down As grand as in the days before; Only they had lost a crown; Only to them those days of yore Could come back nevermore. When shall they meet? I cannot tell, Indeed, when they shall meet again, Except some day in Paradise: For this they wait, one waits in pain. Beyond the sea of death love lies For ever, yesterday, today; Angels shall ask them, “Is it well?” And they shall answer, “Yea.” A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW. “Croak, croak, croak,” Thus the Raven spoke, Perched on his crooked tree As hoarse as hoarse could be. Shun him and fear him, Lest the Bridegroom hear him; Scout him and rout him With his ominous eye about him. Yet, “Croak, croak, croak,” Still tolled from the oak; From that fatal black bird, Whether heard or unheard: “O ship upon the high seas, Freighted with lives and spices, Sink, O ship,” croaked the Raven: “Let the Bride mount to heaven.” In a far foreign land Upon the wave-edged sand, Some friends gaze wistfully Across the glittering sea. “If we could clasp our sister,” Three say, “now we have missed her!” “If we could kiss our daughter!” Two sigh across the water. Oh the ship sails fast With silken flags at the mast, And the home-wind blows soft; But a Raven sits aloft, Chuckling and choking, Croaking, croaking, croaking:— Let the beacon-fire blaze higher; Bridegroom, watch; the Bride draws nigher. On a sloped sandy beach, Which the spring-tide billows reach, Stand a watchful throng Who have hoped and waited long: “Fie on this ship, that tarries With the priceless freight it carries. The time seems long and longer: O languid wind, wax stronger;”— Whilst the Raven perched at east Still croaks and does not cease, One monotonous note Tolled from his iron throat: “No father, no mother, But I have a sable brother: He sees where ocean flows to, And he knows what he knows too.” A day and a night They kept watch worn and white; A night and a day For the swift ship on its way: For the Bride and her maidens —Clear chimes the bridal cadence— For the tall ship that never Hove in sight for ever. On either shore, some Stand in grief loud or dumb As the dreadful dread Grows certain tho' unsaid. For laughter there is weeping, And waking instead of sleeping, And a desperate sorrow Morrow after morrow. Oh who knows the truth, How she perished in her youth, And like a queen went down Pale in her royal crown: How she went up to glory From the sea-foam chill and hoary, From the sea-depth black and riven To the calm that is in Heaven? They went down, all the crew, The silks and spices too, The great ones and the small, One and all, one and all. Was it thro' stress of weather, Quicksands, rocks, or all together? Only the Raven knows this, And he will not disclose this.— After a day and a year The bridal bells chime clear; After a year and a day The Bridegroom is brave and gay: Love is sound, faith is rotten; The old Bride is forgotten:— Two ominous Ravens only Remember, black and lonely. LIGHT LOVE. “Oh sad thy lot before I came, But sadder when I go; My presence but a flash of flame, A transitory glow Between two barren wastes like snow. What wilt thou do when I am gone, Where wilt thou rest, my dear? For cold thy bed to rest upon, And cold the falling year Whose withered leaves are lost and sere.” She hushed the baby at her breast, She rocked it on her knee: “And I will rest my lonely rest, Warmed with the thought of thee, Rest lulled to rest by memory.” She hushed the baby with her kiss, She hushed it with her breast: “Is death so sadder much than this— Sure death that builds a nest For those who elsewhere cannot rest?” “Oh sad thy note, my mateless dove, With tender nestling cold; But hast thou ne'er another love Left from the days of old, To build thy nest of silk and gold, To warm thy paleness to a blush When I am far away— To warm thy coldness to a flush, And turn thee back to May, And turn thy twilight back to day?” She did not answer him again, But leaned her face aside, Wrung with the pang of shame and pain, And sore with wounded pride: He knew his very soul had lied. She strained his baby in her arms, His baby to her heart: “Even let it go, the love that harms: We twain will never part; Mine own, his own, how dear thou art.” “Now never teaze me, tender-eyed, Sigh-voiced,” he said in scorn: “For nigh at hand there blooms a bride, My bride before the morn; Ripe-blooming she, as thou forlorn. Ripe-blooming she, my rose, my peach; She wooes me day and night: I watch her tremble in my reach; She reddens, my delight; She ripens, reddens in my sight.” “And is she like a sunlit rose? Am I like withered leaves? Haste where thy spicèd garden blows: But in bare Autumn eves Wilt thou have store of harvest sheaves? Thou leavest love, true love behind, To seek a love as true; Go, seek in haste: but wilt thou find? Change new again for new; Pluck up, enjoy—yea, trample too. “Alas for her, poor faded rose, Alas for her, like me, Cast down and trampled in the snows.” “Like thee? nay, not like thee: She leans, but from a guarded tree. Farewell, and dream as long ago, Before we ever met: Farewell; my swift-paced horse seems slow.” She raised her eyes, not wet But hard, to Heaven: “Does God forget?” ON THE WING. Once in a dream (for once I dreamed of you) We stood together in an open field; Above our heads two swift-winged pigeons wheeled, Sporting at ease and courting full in view. When loftier still a broadening darkness flew, Down-swooping, and a ravenous hawk revealed; Too weak to fight, to fond to fly, they yield; So farewell life and love and pleasures new. Then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground, Their snow-white plumage flecked with crimson drops, I wept, and thought I turned towards you to weep: But you were gone; while rustling hedgerow tops Bent in a wind which bore to me a sound Of far-off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep. A RING POSY. Jess and Jill are pretty girls, Plump and well to do, In a cloud of windy curls: Yet I know who Loves me more than curls or pearls. I'm not pretty, not a bit; Thin and sallow-pale; When I trudge along the street I don't need a veil: Yet I have one fancy hit. Jess and Jill can trill and sing With a flute-like voice, Dance as light as bird on wing, Laugh for careless joys: Yet it's I who wear the ring. Jess and Jill will mate some day, Surely, surely; Ripen on to June thro' May, While the sun shines make their hay, Slacken steps demurely: Yet even there I lead the way. BEAUTY IS VAIN. While roses are so red, While lilies are so white, Shall a woman exalt her face Because it gives delight? She's not so sweet as a rose, A lily's straighter than she, And if she were as red or white She'd be but one of three. Whether she flush in love's summer Or in its winter grow pale, Whether she flaunt her beauty Or hide it away in a veil, Be she red or white, And stand she erect or bowed, Time will win the race he runs with her And hide her away in a shroud. MAGGIE A LADY. You must not call me Maggie, you must not call me Dear, For I'm Lady of the Manor now stately to see; And if there comes a babe, as there may some happy year, 'Twill be little lord or lady at my knee. Oh but what ails you, my sailor cousin Phil, That you shake and turn white like a cockcrow ghost? You're as white as I turned once down by the mill, When one told me you and ship and crew were lost: Philip my playfellow, when we were boy and girl (It was the Miller's Nancy told it to me), Philip with the merry life in lip and curl, Philip my playfellow drowned in the sea! I thought I should have fainted, but I did not faint; I stood stunned at the moment, scarcely sad, Till I raised my wail of desolate complaint For you, my cousin, brother, all I had. They said I looked so pale—some say so fair— My lord stopped in passing to soothe me back to life: I know I missed a ringlet from my hair Next morning; and now I am his wife. Look at my gown, Philip, and look at my ring, I'm all crimson and gold from top to toe: All day long I sit in the sun and sing, Where in the sun red roses blush and blow. And I'm the rose of roses, says my lord; And to him I'm more than the sun in the sky, While I hold him fast with the golden cord Of a curl, with the eyelash of an eye. His mother said “fie,” and his sisters cried “shame,” His highborn ladies cried “shame” from their place: They said “fie” when they only heard my name, But fell silent when they saw my face. Am I so fair, Philip? Philip, did you think I was so fair when we played boy and girl, Where blue forget-me-nots bloomed on the brink Of our stream which the mill-wheel sent awhirl? If I was fair then sure I'm fairer now, Sitting where a score of servants stand, With a coronet on high days for my brow And almost a sceptre for my hand. You're but a sailor, Philip, weatherbeaten brown, A stranger on land and at home on the sea, Coasting as best you may from town to town: Coasting along do you often think of me? I'm a great lady in a sheltered bower, With hands grown white thro' having nought to do: Yet sometimes I think of you hour after hour Till I nigh wish myself a child with you. WHAT WOULD I GIVE? What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me thro', Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do; Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all. What would I give for words, if only words would come; But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb: O merry friends, go your way, I have never a word to say. What would I give for tears, not smiles but scalding tears, To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years, To wash the stain ingrain and to make me clean again. THE BOURNE. Underneath the growing grass, Underneath the living flowers, Deeper than the sound of showers: There we shall not count the hours By the shadows as they pass. Youth and health will be but vain, Beauty reckoned of no worth: There a very little girth Can hold round what once the earth Seemed too narrow to contain. SUMMER. Winter is cold-hearted, Spring is yea and nay, Autumn is a weathercock Blown every way: Summer days for me When every leaf is on its tree; When Robin's not a beggar, And Jenny Wren's a bride, And larks hang singing, singing, singing, Over the wheat-fields wide, And anchored lilies ride, And the pendulum spider Swings from side to side, And blue-black beetles transact business, And gnats fly in a host, And furry caterpillars hasten That no time be lost, And moths grow fat and thrive, And ladybirds arrive. Before green apples blush, Before green nuts embrown, Why, one day in the country Is worth a month in town; Is worth a day and a year Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion That days drone elsewhere. AUTUMN. I dwell alone—I dwell alone, alone, Whilst full my river flows down to the sea, Gilded with flashing boats That bring no friend to me: O love-songs, gurgling from a hundred throats, O love-pangs, let me be. Fair fall the freighted boats which gold and stone And spices bear to sea: Slim, gleaming maidens swell their mellow notes, Love-promising, entreating— Ah! sweet, but fleeting— Beneath the shivering, snow-white sails. Hush! the wind flags and fails— Hush! they will lie becalmed in sight of strand— Sight of my strand, where I do dwell alone; Their songs wake singing echoes in my land— They cannot hear me moan. One latest, solitary swallow flies Across the sea, rough autumn-tempest tost, Poor bird, shall it be lost? Dropped down into this uncongenial sea, With no kind eyes To watch it while it dies, Unguessed, uncared for, free: Set free at last, The short pang past, In sleep, in death, in dreamless sleep locked fast. Mine avenue is all a growth of oaks, Some rent by thunder strokes, Some rustling leaves and acorns in the breeze; Fair fall my fertile trees, That rear their goodly heads, and live at ease. A spider's web blocks all mine avenue; He catches down and foolish painted flies, That spider wary and wise. Each morn it hangs a rainbow strung with dew Betwixt boughs green with sap, So fair, few creatures guess it is a trap: I will not mar the web, Tho' sad I am to see the small lives ebb. It shakes—my trees shake—for a wind is roused In cavern where it housed: Each white and quivering sail, Of boats among the water leaves Hollows and strains in the full-throated gale: Each maiden sings again— Each languid maiden, whom the calm Had lulled to sleep with rest and spice and balm. Miles down my river to the sea They float and wane, Long miles away from me. Perhaps they say: “She grieves, Uplifted, like a beacon, on her tower.” Perhaps they say: “One hour More, and we dance among the golden sheaves.” Perhaps they say: “One hour More, and we stand, Face to face, hand in hand; Make haste, O slack gale, to the looked-for land!” My trees are not in flower, I have no bower, And gusty creaks my tower, And lonesome, very lonesome, is my strand. THE GHOST'S PETITION. “There's a footstep coming; look out and see.”— “The leaves are falling, the wind is calling; No one cometh across the lea.”— “There's a footstep coming; O sister, look.”— “The ripple flashes, the white foam dashes; No one cometh across the brook.”— “But he promised that he would come: Tonight, tomorrow, in joy or sorrow, He must keep his word, and must come home. “For he promised that he would come: His word was given; from earth or heaven, He must keep his word, and must come home. “Go to sleep, my sweet sister Jane; You can slumber, who need not number Hour after hour, in doubt and pain. “I shall sit here awhile, and watch; Listening, hoping, for one hand groping In deep shadow to find the latch.” After the dark, and before the light, One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping, Who had watched and wept the weary night. After the night, and before the day, One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping— Watching, weeping for one away. There came a footstep climbing the stair; Some one standing out on the landing Shook the door like a puff of air— Shook the door and in he passed. Did he enter? In the room centre Stood her husband: the door shut fast. “O Robin, but you are cold— Chilled with the night-dew: so lily-white you Look like a stray lamb from our fold. “O Robin, but you are late: Come and sit near me—sit here and cheer me.”— (Blue the flame burnt in the grate.) “Lay not down your head on my breast: I cannot hold you, kind wife, nor fold you In the shelter that you love best. “Feel not after my clasping hand: I am but a shadow, come from the meadow Where many lie, but no tree can stand. “We are trees which have shed their leaves: Our heads lie low there, but no tears flow there; Only I grieve for my wife who grieves. “I could rest if you would not moan Hour after hour; I have no power To shut my ears where I lie alone. “I could rest if you would not cry; But there's no sleeping while you sit weeping— Watching, weeping so bitterly.”— “Woe's me! woe's me! for this I have heard. Oh night of sorrow!—oh black tomorrow! Is it thus that you keep your word? “O you who used so to shelter me Warm from the least wind—why, now the east wind Is warmer than you, whom I quake to see. “O my husband of flesh and blood, For whom my mother I left, and brother, And all I had, accounting it good, “What do you do there, underground, In the dark hollow? I'm fain to follow. What do you do there?—what have you found?”— “What I do there I must not tell: But I have plenty: kind wife, content ye: It is well with us—it is well. “Tender hand hath made our nest; Our fear is ended, our hope is blended With present pleasure, and we have rest.”— “Oh but Robin, I'm fain to come, If your present days are so pleasant; For my days are so wearisome. “Yet I'll dry my tears for your sake: Why should I tease you, who cannot please you Any more with the pains I take?” MEMORY. I. In nursed it in my bosom while it lived, I hid it in my heart when it was dead; In joy I sat alone, even so I grieved Alone and nothing said. I shut the door to face the naked truth, I stood alone—I faced the truth alone, Stripped bare of self-regard or forms or ruth Till first and last were shown. I took the perfect balances and weighed; No shaking of my hand disturbed the poise; Weighed, found it wanting: not a word I said, But silent made my choice. None know the choice I made; I make it still. None know the choice I made and broke my heart, Breaking mine idol: I have braced my will Once, chosen for once my part. I broke it at a blow, I laid it cold, Crushed in my deep heart where it used to live. My heart dies inch by inch; the time grows old, Grows old in which I grieve. II I have a room whereinto no one enters Save I myself alone: There sits a blessed memory on a throne, There my life centres; While winter comes and goes—oh tedious comer!— And while its nip-wind blows; While bloom the bloodless lily and warm rose Of lavish summer. If any should force entrance he might see there One buried yet not dead, Before whose face I no more bow my head Or bend my knee there; But often in my worn life's autumn weather I watch there with clear eyes, And think how it will be in Paradise When we're together. A ROYAL PRINCESS. I, a princess, king-descended, decked with jewels, gilded, drest, Would rather be a peasant with her baby at her breast, For all I shine so like the sun, and am purple like the west. Two and two my guards behind, two and two before, Two and two on either hand, they guard me evermore; Me, poor dove that must not coo—eagle that must not soar. All my fountains cast up perfumes, all my gardens grow Scented woods and foreign spices, with all flowers in blow That are costly, out of season as the seasons go. All my walls are lost in mirrors, whereupon I trace Self to right hand, self to left hand, self in every place, Self-same solitary figure, self-same seeking face. Then I have an ivory chair high to sit upon, Almost like my father's chair, which is an ivory throne; There I sit uplift and upright, there I sit alone. Alone by day, alone by night, alone days without end; My father and my mother give me treasures, search and spend— O my father! O my mother! have you ne'er a friend? As I am a lofty princess, so my father is A lofty king, accomplished in all kingly subtilties, Holding in his strong right hand world-kingdoms' balances. He has quarrelled with his neighbours, he has scourged his foes; Vassal counts and princes follow where his pennon goes, Long-descended valiant lords whom the vulture knows, On whose track the vulture swoops, when they ride in state To break the strength of armies and topple down the great: Each of these my courteous servant, none of these my mate. My father counting up his strength sets down with equal pen So many head of cattle, head of horses, head of men; These for slaughter, these for labour, with the how and when. Some to work on roads, canals; some to man his ships; Some to smart in mines beneath sharp overseers' whips; Some to trap fur-beasts in lands where utmost winter nips. Once it came into my heart and whelmed me like a flood, That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood; Men with hearts and men with souls, tho' trodden down like mud. Our feasting was not glad that night, our music was not gay; On my mother's graceful head I marked a thread of grey, My father frowning at the fare seemed every dish to weigh. I sat beside them sole princess in my exalted place, My ladies and my gentlemen stood by me on the dais: A mirror showed me I look old and haggard in the face; It showed me that my ladies all are fair to gaze upon, Plump, plenteous-haired, to every one love's secret lore is known, They laugh by day, they sleep by night; ah, me, what is a throne? The singing men and women sang that night as usual, The dancers danced in pairs and sets, but music had a fall, A melancholy windy fall as at a funeral. Amid the toss of torches to my chamber back we swept; My ladies loosed my golden chain; meantime I could have wept To think of some in galling chains whether they waked or slept. I took my bath of scented milk, delicately waited on, They burned sweet things for my delight, cedar and cinnamon, They lit my shaded silver lamp, and left me there alone. A day went by, a week went by. One day I heard it said: “Men are clamouring, women, children, clamouring to be fed; Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread.” So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear, Vulgar naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear; Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near. But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark: “There are families out grazing like cattle in the park.” “A pair of peasants must be saved, even if we build an ark.” A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way; One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day; One was my youngest maid, as sweet and white as cream in May. Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp; Voices said: “Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp, To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp.” “Howl and stamp?” one answered: “They made free to hurl a stone At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown.” “There's work then for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown.” “One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head, Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread: Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead.” “After us the deluge,” was retorted with a laugh: “If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff.” “While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff.” These passed. “The king:” stand up. Said my father with a smile: “Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile, She's sad today, and who but you her sadness can beguile?” He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait,— (I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate)— Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state; Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene, There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between; Or shall she merely fan me while I wait here for the queen? Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command: “Charge!” a clash of steel: “Charge again, the rebels stand. Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand.” There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher; A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire; I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire. “Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread, You who sat to see us starve,” one shrieking woman said: “Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head.” Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth, I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith, I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath; With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand, I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand Where they curse king, queen, and princess of this cursed land. They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give; I, if I perish, perish; they today shall eat and live; I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive: Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show The lesson I have learned, which is death, is life, to know. I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go. SHALL I FORGET? Shall I forget on this side of the grave? I promise nothing: you must wait and see Patient and brave. (O my soul, watch with him and he with me.) Shall I forget in peace of Paradise? I promise nothing: follow, friend, and see Faithful and wise. (O my soul, lead the way he walks with me.) VANITY OF VANITIES. Ah woe is me for pleasure that is vain, Ah woe is me for glory that is past: Pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last, Glory that at the last bringeth no gain! So saith the sinking heart; and so again It shall say till the mighty angel-blast Is blown, making the sun and moon aghast, And showering down the stars like sudden rain. And evermore men shall go fearfully Bending beneath their weight of heaviness; And ancient men shall lie down wearily, And strong men shall rise up in weariness; Yea, even the young shall answer sighingly, Saying one to another: How vain it is! L. E. L. “Whose heart was breaking for a little love.” Downstairs I laugh, I sport and jest with all: But in my solitary room above I turn my face in silence to the wall; My heart is breaking for a little love. Tho' winter frosts are done, And birds pair every one, And leaves peep out, for springtide is begun. I feel no spring, while spring is wellnigh blown, I find no nest, while nests are in the grove: Woe's me for mine own heart that dwells alone, My heart that breaketh for a little love. While golden in the sun Rivulets rise and run, While lilies bud, for springtide is begun. All love, are loved, save only I; their hearts Beat warm with love and joy, beat full thereof: They cannot guess, who play the pleasant parts, My heart is breaking for a little love. While beehives wake and whirr, And rabbit thins his fur, In living spring that sets the world astir. I deck myself with silks and jewelry, I plume myself like any mated dove: They praise my rustling show, and never see My heart is breaking for a little love. While sprouts green lavender With rosemary and myrrh, For in quick spring the sap is all astir. Perhaps some saints in glory guess the truth, Perhaps some angels read it as they move, And cry one to another full of ruth, “Her heart is breaking for a little love.” Tho' other things have birth, And leap and sing for mirth, When springtime wakes and clothes and feeds the earth. Yet saith a saint: “Take patience for thy scathe;” Yet saith an angel: “Wait, for thou shalt prove True best is last, true life is born of death, O thou, heart-broken for a little love. Then love shall fill thy girth, And love make fat thy dearth, When new spring builds new heaven and clean new earth.” LIFE AND DEATH. Life is not sweet. One day it will be sweet To shut our eyes and die: Nor feel the wild flowers blow, nor birds dart by With flitting butterfly, Nor grass grow long above our heads and feet, Nor hear the happy lark that soars sky high, Nor sigh that spring is fleet and summer fleet, Nor mark the waxing wheat, Nor know who sits in our accustomed seat. Life is not good. One day it will be good To die, then live again; To sleep meanwhile: so not to feel the wane Of shrunk leaves dropping in the wood, Nor hear the foamy lashing of the main, Nor mark the blackened bean-fields, nor where stood Rich ranks of golden grain Only dead refuse stubble clothe the plain: Asleep from risk, asleep from pain. BIRD OR BEAST? Did any bird come flying After Adam and Eve, When the door was shut against them And they sat down to grieve? I think not Eve's peacock Splendid to see, And I think not Adam's eagle; But a dove may be. Did any beast come pushing Thro' the thorny hedge Into the thorny thistly world Out from Eden's edge? I think not a lion Tho' his strength is such; But an innocent loving lamb May have done as much. If the dove preached from her bough And the lamb from his sod, The lamb and the dove Were preachers sent from God. EVE. “While I sit at the door Sick to gaze within Mine eye weepeth sore For sorrow and sin: As a tree my sin stands To darken all lands; Death is the fruit it bore. “How have Eden bowers grown Without Adam to bend them! How have Eden flowers blown Squandering their sweet breath Without me to tend them! The Tree of Life was ours, Tree twelvefold-fruited, Most lofty tree that flowers, Most deeply rooted: I chose the tree of death. “Hadst thou but said me nay, Adam, my brother, I might have pined away; I, but none other: God might have let thee stay Safe in our garden, By putting me away Beyond all pardon. “I, Eve, sad mother Of all who must live, I, not another, Plucked bitterest fruit to give My friend, husband, lover;— O wanton eyes, run over; Who but I should grieve?— Cain hath slain his brother: Of all who must die mother, Miserable Eve!” Thus she sat weeping, Thus Eve our mother, Where one lay sleeping Slain by his brother. Greatest and least Each piteous beast To hear her voice Forgot his joys And set aside his feast. The mouse paused in his walk And dropped his wheaten stalk; Grave cattle wagged their heads In rumination; The eagle gave a cry From his cloud station; Larks on thyme beds Forbore to mount or sing; Bees drooped upon the wing; The raven perched on high Forgot his ration; The conies in their rock, A feeble nation, Quaked sympathetical; The mocking-bird left off to mock; Huge camels knelt as if In deprecation; The kind hart's tears were falling; Chattered the wistful stork; Dove-voices with a dying fall Cooed desolation Answering grief by grief. Only the serpent in the dust Wriggling and crawling, Grinned an evil grin and thrust His tongue out with its fork. GROWN AND FLOWN. I loved my love from green of Spring Until sere Autumn's fall; But now that leaves are withering How should one love at all? One heart's too small For hunger, cold, love, everything. I loved my love on sunny days Until late Summer's wane; But now that frost begins to glaze How should one love again? Nay, love and pain Walk wide apart in diverse ways. I loved my love—alas to see That this should be, alas! I thought that this could scarcely be, Yet has it come to pass: Sweet sweet love was, Now bitter bitter grown to me. A FARM WALK. The year stood at its equinox And bluff the North was blowing, A bleat of lambs came from the flocks, Green hardy things were growing; I met a maid with shining locks Where milky kine were lowing. She wore a kerchief on her neck, Her bare arm showed its dimple, Her apron spread without a speck, Her air was frank and simple. She milked into a wooden pail And sang a country ditty, An innocent fond lovers' tale, That was not wise nor witty, Pathetically rustical, Too pointless for the city. She kept in time without a beat As true as church-bell ringers, Unless she tapped time with her feet, Or squeezed it with her fingers; Her clear unstudied notes were sweet As many a practised singer's. I stood a minute out of sight, Stood silent for a minute To eye the pail, and creamy white The frothing milk within it; To eye the comely milking maid Herself so fresh and creamy: “Good day to you,” at last I said; She turned her head to see me: “Good day,” she said with lifted head; Her eyes looked soft and dreamy, And all the while she milked and milked The grave cow heavy-laden: I've seen grand ladies plumed and silked, But not a sweeter maiden; But not a sweeter fresher maid Than this in homely cotton Whose pleasant face and silky braid I have not yet forgotten. Seven springs have passed since then, as I Count with a sober sorrow; Seven springs have come and passed me by, And spring sets in tomorrow. I've half a mind to shake myself Free just for once from London, To set my work upon the shelf And leave it done or undone; To run down by the early train, Whirl down with shriek and whistle, And feel the bluff North blow again, And mark the sprouting thistle Set up on waste patch of the lane Its green and tender bristle, And spy the scarce-blown violet banks, Crisp primrose leaves and others, And watch the lambs leap at their pranks And butt their patient mothers. Alas, one point in all my plan My serious thoughts demur to: Seven years have passed for maid and man, Seven years have passed for her too; Perhaps my rose is overblown, Not rosy or too rosy; Perhaps in farmhouse of her own Some husband keeps her cosy, Where I should show a face unknown. Good bye, my wayside posy. SOMEWHERE OR OTHER. Somewhere or other there must surely be The face not seen, the voice not heard, The heart that not yet—never yet—ah me! Made answer to my word. Somewhere or other, may be near or far; Past land and sea, clean out of sight; Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star That tracks her night by night. Somewhere or other, may be far or near; With just a wall, a hedge, between; With just the last leaves of the dying year Fallen on a turf grown green. A CHILL. What can lambkins do All the keen night thro'? Nestle by their woolly mother The careful ewe. What can nestlings do In the nightly dew? Sleep beneath their mother's wing Till day breaks anew. If in field or tree There might only be Such a warm soft sleeping-place Found for me! CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL. I wish you were a pleasant wren, And I your small accepted mate; How we'd look down on toilsome men! We'd rise and go to bed at eight Or it may be not quite so late. Then you should see the nest I'd build, The wondrous nest for you and me; The outside rough perhaps, but filled With wool and down: ah, you should see The cosy nest that it would be. We'd have our change of hope and fear, Small quarrels, reconcilements sweet: I'd perch by you to chirp and cheer, Or hop about on active feet And fetch you dainty bits to eat. We'd be so happy by the day, So safe and happy thro' the night, We both should feel, and I should say, It's all one season of delight, And we'll make merry whilst we may. Perhaps some day there'd be an egg When spring had blossomed from the snow: I'd stand triumphant on one leg; Like chanticleer I'd almost crow To let our little neighbours know. Next you should sit and I would sing Thro' lengthening days of sunny spring; Till, if you wearied of the task, I'd sit; and you should spread your wing From bough to bough; I'd sit and bask. Fancy the breaking of the shell, The chirp, the chickens wet and bare, The untried proud paternal swell; And you with housewife-matron air Enacting choicer bills of fare. Fancy the embryo coats of down, The gradual feathers soft and sleek; Till clothed and strong from tail to crown, With virgin warblings in their beak, They too go forth to soar and seek. So would it last an April thro' And early summer fresh with dew: Then should we part and live as twain, Love-time would bring me back to you And build our happy nest again. GONE FOR EVER. O happy rose-bud blooming Upon thy parent tree, Nay, thou art too presuming; For soon the earth entombing Thy faded charms shall be, And the chill damp consuming. O happy skylark springing Up to the broad blue sky, Too fearless in thy winging, Too gladsome in thy singing, Thou also soon shalt lie Where no sweet notes are ringing. And through life's shine and shower We shall have joy and pain; But in the summer bower, And at the morning hour, We still shall look in vain For the same bird and flower. “THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN” Oh the rose of keenest thorn! One hidden summer morn Under the rose I was born. I do not guess his name Who wrought my Mother's shame, And gave me life forlorn, But my Mother, Mother, Mother, I know her from all other. My Mother pale and mild, Fair as ever was seen, She was but scarce sixteen, Little more than a child, When I was born To work her scorn. With secret bitter throes, In a passion of secret woes, She bore me under the rose. One who my Mother nursed Took me from the first:— “O nurse, let me look upon This babe that costs so dear; Tomorrow she will be gone: Other mothers may keep Their babes awake and asleep, But I must not keep her here.”— Whether I know or guess, I know this not the less. So I was sent away That none might spy the truth: And my childhood waxed to youth And I left off childish play. I never cared to play With the village boys and girls; And I think they thought me proud, I found so little to say And kept so from the crowd: But I had the longest curls And I had the largest eyes, And my teeth were small like pearls; The girls might flout and scout me, But the boys would hang about me In sheepish mooning wise. Our one-street village stood A long mile from the town, A mile of windy down And bleak one-sided wood, With not a single house. Our town itself was small, With just the common shops, And throve in its small way. Our neighbouring gentry reared The good old-fashioned crops, And made old-fashioned boasts Of what John Bull would do If Frenchman Frog appeared, And drank old-fashioned toasts, And made old-fashioned bows To my Lady at the Hall. My Lady at the Hall Is grander than they all: Hers is the oldest name In all the neighbourhood; But the race must die with her Tho' she's a lofty dame, For she's unmarried still. Poor people say she's good And has an open hand As any in the land, And she's the comforter Of many sick and sad; My nurse once said to me That everything she had Came of my Lady's bounty: “Tho' she's greatest in the county She's humble to the poor, No beggar seeks her door But finds help presently. I pray both night and day For her, and you must pray: But she'll never feel distress If needy folk can bless.” I was a little maid When here we came to live From somewhere by the sea. Men spoke a foreign tongue There where we used to be When I was merry and young, Too young to feel afraid; The fisher-folk would give A kind strange word to me, There by the foreign sea: I don't know where it was, But I remember still Our cottage on a hill, And fields of flowering grass On that fair foreign shore. I liked my old home best, But this was pleasant too: So here we made our nest And here I grew. And now and then my Lady In riding past our door Would nod to Nurse and speak, Or stoop and pat my cheek; And I was always ready To hold the field-gate wide For my Lady to go thro'; My Lady in her veil So seldom put aside, My Lady grave and pale. I often sat to wonder Who might my parents be, For I knew of something under My simple-seeming state. Nurse never talked to me Of mother or of father, But watched me early and late With kind suspicious cares: Or not suspicious, rather Anxious, as if she knew Some secret I might gather And smart for unawares. Thus I grew. But Nurse waxed old and grey, Bent and weak with years. There came a certain day That she lay upon her bed Shaking her palsied head, With words she gasped to say Which had to stay unsaid. Then with a jerking hand Held out so piteously She gave a ring to me Of gold wrought curiously, A ring which she had worn Since the day that I was born, She once had said to me: I slipped it on my finger; Her eyes were keen to linger On my hand that slipped it on; Then she sighed one rattling sigh And stared on with sightless eyes:— The one who loved me was gone. How long I stayed alone With the corpse, I never knew, For I fainted dead as stone: When I came to life once more I was down upon the floor, With neighbours making ado To bring me back to life. I heard the sexton's wife Say: “Up, my lad, and run To tell it at the Hall; She was my Lady's nurse, And done can't be undone. I'll watch by this poor lamb. I guess my Lady's purse Is always open to such: I'd run up on my crutch A cripple as I am,” (For cramps had vexed her much) “Rather than this dear heart Lack one to take her part.” For days day after day On my weary bed I lay Wishing the time would pass; Oh, so wishing that I was Likely to pass away: For the one friend whom I knew Was dead, I knew no other, Neither father nor mother; And I, what should I do? One day the sexton's wife Said: “Rouse yourself, my dear: My Lady has driven down From the Hall into the town, And we think she's coming here. Cheer up, for life is life.” But I would not look or speak, Would not cheer up at all. My tears were like to fall, So I turned round to the wall And hid my hollow cheek Making as if I slept, As silent as a stone, And no one knew I wept. What was my Lady to me, The grand lady from the Hall? She might come, or stay away, I was sick at heart that day: The whole world seemed to be Nothing, just nothing to me, For aught that I could see. Yet I listened where I lay: A bustle came below, A clear voice said: “I know; I will see her first alone, It may be less of a shock If she's so weak today:”— A light hand turned the lock, A light step crossed the floor, One sat beside my bed: But never a word she said. For me, my shyness grew Each moment more and more: So I said never a word And neither looked nor stirred; I think she must have heard My heart go pit-a-pat: Thus I lay, my Lady sat, More than a mortal hour— (I counted one and two By the house-clock while I lay): I seemed to have no power To think of a thing to say, Or do what I ought to do, Or rouse myself to a choice. At last she said: “Margaret, Won't you even look at me?” A something in her voice Forced my tears to fall at last, Forced sobs from me thick and fast; Something not of the past, Yet stirring memory; A something new, and yet Not new, too sweet to last, Which I never can forget. I turned and stared at her: Her cheek showed hollow-pale; Her hair like mine was fair, A wonderful fall of hair That screened her like a veil; But her height was statelier, Her eyes had depth more deep; I think they must have had Always a something sad, Unless they were asleep. While I stared, my Lady took My hand in her spare hand Jewelled and soft and grand, And looked with a long long look Of hunger in my face; As if she tried to trace Features she ought to know, And half hoped, half feared, to find. Whatever was in her mind She heaved a sigh at last, And began to talk to me. “Your nurse was my dear nurse, And her nursling's dear,” said she: “No one told me a word Of her getting worse and worse, Till her poor life was past” (Here my Lady's tears dropped fast): “I might have been with her, I might have promised and heard, But she had no comforter. She might have told me much Which now I shall never know, Never never shall know.” She sat by me sobbing so, And seemed so woe-begone, That I laid one hand upon Hers with a timid touch, Scarce thinking what I did, Not knowing what to say: That moment her face was hid In the pillow close by mine, Her arm was flung over me, She hugged me, sobbing so As if her heart would break, And kissed me where I lay. After this she often came To bring me fruit or wine, Or sometimes hothouse flowers. And at nights I lay awake Often and often thinking What to do for her sake. Wet or dry it was the same: She would come in at all hours, Set me eating and drinking And say I must grow strong; At last the day seemed long And home seemed scarcely home If she did not come. Well, I grew strong again: In time of primroses, I went to pluck them in the lane; In time of nestling birds, I heard them chirping round the house; And all the herds Were out at grass when I grew strong, And days were waxen long, And there was work for bees Among the May-bush boughs, And I had shot up tall, And life felt after all Pleasant, and not so long When I grew strong. I was going to the Hall To be my Lady's maid: “Her little friend,” she said to me, “Almost her child,” She said and smiled Sighing painfully; Blushing, with a second flush As if she blushed to blush. Friend, servant, child: just this My standing at the Hall; The other servants call me “Miss,” My Lady calls me “Margaret,” With her clear voice musical. She never chides when I forget This or that; she never chides. Except when people come to stay, (And that's not often) at the Hall, I sit with her all day And ride out when she rides. She sings to me and makes me sing; Sometimes I read to her, Sometimes we merely sit and talk. She noticed once my ring And made me tell its history: That evening in our garden walk She said she should infer The ring had been my father's first, Then my mother's, given for me To the nurse who nursed My mother in her misery, That so quite certainly Some one might know me, who. . . Then she was silent, and I too. I hate when people come: The women speak and stare And mean to be so civil. This one will stroke my hair, That one will pat my cheek And praise my Lady's kindness, Expecting me to speak; I like the proud ones best Who sit as struck with blindness, As if I wasn't there. But if any gentleman Is staying at the Hall (Tho' few come prying here), My Lady seems to fear Some downright dreadful evil, And makes me keep my room As closely as she can: So I hate when people come, It is so troublesome. In spite of all her care, Sometimes to keep alive I sometimes do contrive To get out in the grounds For a whiff of wholesome air, Under the rose you know: It's charming to break bounds, Stolen waters are sweet, And what's the good of feet If for days they mustn't go? Give me a longer tether, Or I may break from it. Now I have eyes and ears And just some little wit: “Almost my Lady's child;” I recollect she smiled, Sighed and blushed together; Then her story of the ring Sounds not improbable, She told it me so well It seemed the actual thing:— Oh, keep your counsel close, But I guess under the rose, In long past summer weather When the world was blossoming, And the rose upon its thorn: I guess not who he was Flawed honour like a glass And made my life forlorn, But my Mother, Mother, Mother, Oh, I know her from all other. My Lady, you might trust Your daughter with your fame. Trust me, I would not shame Our honourable name, For I have noble blood Tho' I was bred in dust And brought up in the mud. I will not press my claim, Just leave me where you will: But you might trust your daughter, For blood is thicker than water And you're my mother still. So my Lady holds her own With condescending grace, And fills her lofty place With an untroubled face As a queen may fill a throne. While I could hint a tale— (But then I am her child)— Would make her quail; Would set her in the dust, Lorn with no comforter, Her glorious hair defiled And ashes on her cheek: The decent world would thrust Its finger out at her, Not much displeased I think To make a nine days' stir; The decent world would sink Its voice to speak of her. Now this is what I mean To do, no more, no less: Never to speak, or show Bare sign of what I know. Let the blot pass unseen; Yea, let her never guess I hold the tangled clue She huddles out of view. Friend, servant, almost child, So be it and nothing more On this side of the grave. Mother, in Paradise, You'll see with clearer eyes; Perhaps in this world even When you are like to die And face to face with Heaven You'll drop for once the lie: But you must drop the mask, not I. My Lady promises Two hundred pounds with me Whenever I may wed A man she can approve: And since besides her bounty I'm fairest in the county (For so I've heard it said, Tho' I don't vouch for this), Her promised pounds may move Some honest man to see My virtues and my beauties; Perhaps the rising grazier, Or temperance publican, May claim my wifely duties. Meanwhile I wait their leisure And grace-bestowing pleasure, I wait the happy man; But if I hold my head And pitch my expectations Just higher than their level, They must fall back on patience: I may not mean to wed, Yet I'll be civil. Now sometimes in a dream My heart goes out of me To build and scheme, Till I sob after things that seem So pleasant in a dream: A home such as I see My blessed neighbours live in With father and with mother, All proud of one another, Named by one common name From baby in the bud To full-blown workman father; It's little short of Heaven. I'd give my gentle blood To wash my special shame And drown my private grudge; I'd toil and moil much rather The dingiest cottage drudge Whose mother need not blush, Than live here like a lady And see my Mother flush And hear her voice unsteady Sometimes, yet never dare Ask to share her care. Of course the servants sneer Behind my back at me; Of course the village girls, Who envy me my curls And gowns and idleness, Take comfort in a jeer; Of course the ladies guess Just so much of my history As points the emphatic stress With which they laud my Lady; The gentlemen who catch A casual glimpse of me And turn again to see, Their valets on the watch To speak a word with me, All know and sting me wild; Till I am almost ready To wish that I were dead, No faces more to see, No more words to be said, My Mother safe at last Disburdened of her child, And the past past. “All equal before God”— Our Rector has it so, And sundry sleepers nod: It may be so; I know All are not equal here, And when the sleepers wake They make a difference. “All equal in the grave”— That shows an obvious sense: Yet something which I crave Not death itself brings near; How should death half atone For all my past; or make The name I bear my own? I love my dear old Nurse Who loved me without gains; I love my mistress even, Friend, Mother, what you will: But I could almost curse My Father for his pains; And sometimes at my prayer Kneeling in sight of Heaven I almost curse him still: Why did he set his snare To catch at unaware My Mother's foolish youth; Load me with shame that's hers, And her with something worse, A lifelong lie for truth? I think my mind is fixed On one point and made up: To accept my lot unmixed; Never to drug the cup But drink it by myself. I'll not be wooed for pelf; I'll not blot out my shame With any man's good name; But nameless as I stand, My hand is my own hand, And nameless as I came I go to the dark land. “All equal in the grave”— I bide my time till then: “All equal before God”— Today I feel His rod, Tomorrow He may save: Amen. DESPISED AND REJECTED. My sun has set, I dwell In darkness as a dead man out of sight; And none remains, not one, that I should tell To him mine evil plight This bitter night. I will make fast my door That hollow friends may trouble me no more. “Friend, open to Me.”—Who is this that calls? Nay, I am deaf as are my walls: Cease crying, for I will not hear Thy cry of hope or fear. Others were dear, Others forsook me: what art thou indeed That I should heed Thy lamentable need? Hungry should feed, Or stranger lodge thee here? “Friend, My Feet bleed. Open thy door to Me and comfort Me.” I will not open, trouble me no more. Go on thy way footsore, I will not rise and open unto thee. “Then is it nothing to thee? Open, see Who stands to plead with thee. Open, lest I should pass thee by, and thou One day entreat My Face And howl for grace, And I be deaf as thou art now. Open to Me.” Then I cried out upon him: Cease, Leave me in peace: Fear not that I should crave Aught thou mayst have. Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more, Lest I arise and chase thee from my door. What, shall I not be let Alone, that thou dost vex me yet? But all night long that voice spake urgently: “Open to Me.” Still harping in mine ears: “Rise, let Me in.” Pleading with tears: “Open to Me that I may come to thee.” While the dew dropped, while the dark hours were cold “My Feet bleed, see My Face, See My Hands bleed that bring thee grace, My Heart doth bleed for thee, Open to Me.” So till the break of day: Then died away That voice, in silence as of sorrow; Then footsteps echoing like a sigh Passed me by, Lingering footsteps slow to pass. On the morrow I saw upon the grass Each footprint marked in blood, and on my door The mark of blood for evermore. LONG BARREN. Thou who didst hang upon a barren tree, My God, for me; Tho' I till now be barren, now at length, Lord, give me strength To bring forth fruit to Thee. Thou who didst bear for me the crown of thorn, Spitting and scorn; Tho' I till now have put forth thorns, yet now Strengthen me Thou That better fruit be borne. Thou Rose of Sharon, Cedar of broad roots, Vine of sweet fruits, Thou Lily of the vale with fadeless leaf, Of thousands Chief, Feed Thou my feeble shoots. IF ONLY. If I might only love my God and die! But now He bids me love Him and live on, Now when the bloom of all my life is gone, The pleasant half of life has quite gone by. My tree of hope is lopped that spread so high; And I forget how Summer glowed and shone, While Autumn grips me with its fingers wan, And frets me with its fitful windy sigh. When Autumn passes then must Winter numb, And Winter may not pass a weary while, But when it passes Spring shall flower again: And in that Spring who weepeth now shall smile, Yea, they shall wax who now are on the wane, Yea, they shall sing for love when Christ shall come. DOST THOU NOT CARE? I love and love not: Lord, it breaks my heart To love and not to love. Thou veiled within Thy glory, gone apart Into Thy shrine, which is above, Dost Thou not love me, Lord, or care For this mine ill?— I love thee here or there, I will accept they broken heart, lie still. Lord, it was well with me in time gone by That cometh not again, When I was fresh and cheerful, who but I? I fresh, I cheerful: worn with pain Now, out of sight and out of heart; O Lord, how long?— I watch thee as thou art, I will accept thy fainting heart, be strong. “Lie still,” “be strong,” today; but, Lord, tomorrow, What of tomorrow, Lord? Shall there be rest from toil, be truce from sorrow, Be living green upon the sward Now but a barren grave to me, Be joy for sorrow?— Did I not die for thee? Do I not live for thee? leave Me tomorrow. WEARY IN WELL-DOING. I would have gone; God bade me stay: I would have worked; God bade me rest. He broke my will from day to day, He read my yearnings unexpressed And said them nay. Now I would stay; God bids me go: Now I would rest; God bids me work. He breaks my heart tossed to and fro, My soul is wrung with doubts that lurk And vex it so. I go, Lord, where Thou sendest me; Day after day I plod and moil: But, Christ my God, when will it be That I may let alone my toil And rest with Thee? MARTYRS' SONG. We meet in joy, tho' we part in sorrow; We part tonight, but we meet tomorrow. Be it flood or blood the path that's trod, All the same it leads home to God: Be it furnace-fire voluminous, One like God's Son will walk with us. What are these that glow from afar, These that lean over the golden bar, Strong as the lion, pure as the dove, With open arms and hearts of love? They the blessed ones gone before, They the blessed for evermore. Out of great tribulation they went Home to their home of Heaven-content; Thro' flood, or blood, or furnace-fire, To the rest that fulfils desire. What are these that fly as a cloud, With flashing heads and faces bowed, In their mouths a victorious psalm, In their hands a robe and a palm? Welcoming angels these that shine, Your own angel, and yours, and mine; Who have hedged us both day and night On the left hand and on the right, Who have watched us both night and day Because the devil keeps watch to slay. Light above light, and Bliss beyond bliss, Whom words cannot utter, lo, Who is This? As a King with many crowns He stands, And our names are graven upon His hands; As a Priest, with God-uplifted eyes, He offers for us His Sacrifice; As the Lamb of God for sinners slain, That we too may live He lives again; As our Champion behold Him stand, Strong to save us, at God's Right Hand. God the Father give us grace To walk in the light of Jesus' Face. God the Son give us a part In the hiding-place of Jesus' Heart: God the Spirit so hold us up That we may drink of Jesus' cup. Death is short and life is long; Satan is strong, but Christ more strong. At His Word, Who hath led us hither, The Red Sea must part hither and thither. At His Word, Who goes before us too, Jordan must cleave to let us thro'. Yet one pang searching and sore, And then Heaven for evermore; Yet one moment awful and dark, Then safety within the Veil and the Ark; Yet one effort by Christ His grace, Then Christ for ever face to face. God the Father we will adore, In Jesus' Name, now and evermore: God the Son we will love and thank In this flood and on the farther bank: God the Holy Ghost we will praise, In Jesus' Name, thro' endless days: God Almighty, God Three in One, God Almighty, God alone. AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT. As eager homebound traveller to the goal, Or steadfast seeker on an unsearched main, Or martyr panting for an aureole, My fellow-pilgrims pass me, and attain That hidden mansion of perpetual peace Where keen desire and hope dwell free from pain: That gate stands open of perennial ease; I view the glory till I partly long, Yet lack the fire of love which quickens these. O passing Angel, speed me with a song, A melody of heaven to reach my heart And rouse me to the race and make me strong; Till in such music I take up my part Swelling those Hallelujahs full of rest, One, tenfold, hundredfold, with heavenly art, Fulfilling north and south and east and west, Thousand, ten thousandfold, innumerable, All blent in one yet each one manifest; Each one distinguished and beloved as well As if no second voice in earth or heaven Were lifted up the Love of God to tell. Ah, Love of God, which Thine Own Self hast given To me most poor, and made me rich in love, Love that dost pass the tenfold seven times seven, Draw Thou mine eyes, draw Thou my heart above, My treasure and my heart store Thou in Thee, Brood over me with yearnings of a dove; Be Husband, Brother, closest Friend to me; Love me as very mother loves her son, Her sucking firstborn fondled on her knee: Yea, more than mother loves her little one; For, earthly, even a mother may forget And feel no pity for its piteous moan; But Thou, O Love of God, remember yet, Thro' the dry desert, thro' the waterflood (Life, death), until the Great White Throne is set. If now I am sick in chewing the bitter cud Of sweet past sin, tho' solaced by Thy grace And ofttimes strengthened by Thy Flesh and Blood, How shall I then stand up before Thy face When from Thine eyes repentance shall be hid And utmost Justice stand in Mercy's place: When every sin I thought or spoke or did Shall meet me at the inexorable bar, And there be no man standing in the mid To plead for me; while star fallen after star With heaven and earth are like a ripened shock, And all time's mighty works and wonders are Consumed as in a moment; when no rock Remains to fall on me, no tree to hide, But I stand all creation's gazing-stock, Exposed and comfortless on every side, Placed trembling in the final balances Whose poise this hour, this moment, must be tried?— Ah Love of God, if greater love than this Hath no man, that a man die for his friend, And if such love of love Thine Own Love is, Plead with Thyself, with me, before the end; Redeem me from the irrevocable past; Pitch Thou Thy Presence round me to defend; Yea seek with piercèd feet, yea hold me fast With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love; Not what I am, remember what Thou wast When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above, And sin Thy Father's Face, while Thou didst drink The bitter cup of death, didst taste thereof For every man; while Thou wast nigh to sink Beneath the intense intolerable rod, Grown sick of love; not what I am, but think Thy Life then ransomed mine, my God, my God. GOOD FRIDAY. Am I a stone and not a sheep That I can stand, O Christ, beneath Thy Cross, To number drop by drop Thy Blood's slow loss, And yet not weep? Not so those women loved Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee; Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly; Not so the thief was moved; Not so the Sun and Moon Which hid their faces in a starless sky, A horror of great darkness at broad noon— I, only I. Yet give not o'er, But seek Thy sheep, true Shepherd of the flock; Greater than Moses, turn and look once more And smite a rock. THE LOWEST PLACE. Give me the lowest place: not that I dare Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died That I might live and share Thy glory by Thy side. Give me the lowest place: or if for me That lowest place too high, make one more low Where I may sit and see My God and love Thee so. III Poems Added in Goblin Market, The Prince's Progress and Other Poems (1875) BY THE SEA. Why does the sea moan evermore? Shut out from heaven it makes its moan, It frets against the boundary shore; All earth's full rivers cannot fill The sea, that drinking thirsteth still. Sheer miracles of loveliness Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed: Anemones, salt, passionless, Blow flower-like; just enough alive To blow and multiply and thrive. Shells quaint with curve, or spot, or spike, Encrusted live things argus-eyed, All fair alike, yet all unlike, Are born without a pang, and die Without a pang, and so pass by. FROM SUNSET TO STAR RISE. Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not: I am no summer friend, but wintry cold, A silly sheep benighted from the fold, A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot. Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot, Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold; Lest you with me should shiver on the wold, Athirst and hungering on a barren spot. For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge, I live alone, I look to die alone: Yet sometimes when a wind sighs through the sedge Ghosts of my buried years and friends come back, My heart goes sighing after swallows flown On sometime summer's unreturning track. DAYS OF VANITY. A dream that waketh, Bubble that breaketh, Song whose burden sigheth, A passing breath, Smoke that vanisheth,— Such is life that dieth. A flower that fadeth, Fruit the tree sheddeth, Trackless bird that flieth, Summer time brief, Falling of the leaf,— Such is life that dieth. A scent exhaling, Snow waters failing, Morning dew that drieth, A windy blast, Lengthening shadows cast,— Such is life that dieth. A scanty measure, Rust-eaten treasure, Spending that nought buyeth, Moth on the wing, Toil unprofiting,— Such is life that dieth. Morrow by morrow Sorrow breeds sorrow, For this my song sigheth; From day to night We lapse out of sight,— Such is life that dieth. ONCE FOR ALL. (MARGARET.) I said: This is a beautiful fresh rose. I said: I will delight me with its scent; Will watch its lovely curve of languishment, Will watch its leaves unclose, its heart unclose. I said: Old earth has put away her snows, All living things make merry to their bent, A flower is come for every flower that went In autumn, the sun glows, the south wind blows. So walking in a garden of delight I came upon one sheltered shadowed nook Where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night, And there lay snow unmelted by the sun:— I answered: Take who will the path I took, Winter nips once for all; love is but one. ENRICA, 1865. She came among us from the South And made the North her home awhile; Our dimness brightened in her smile, Our tongue grew sweeter in her mouth. We chilled beside her liberal glow, She dwarfed us by her ampler scale, Her full-blown blossom made us pale, She summer-like and we like snow. We Englishwomen, trim, correct, All minted in the selfsame mould, Warm-hearted but of semblance cold, All-courteous out of self-respect. She woman in her natural grace, Less trammelled she by lore of school, Courteous by nature not by rule, Warm-hearted and of cordial face. So for awhile she made her home Among us in the rigid North, She who from Italy came forth And scaled the Alps and crossed the foam. But if she found us like our sea, Of aspect colourless and chill, Rock-girt; like it she found us still Deep at our deepest, strong and free. AUTUMN VIOLETS. Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring: Or if these bloom when worn-out autumn grieves, Let them lie hid in double shade of leaves, Their own, and others dropped down withering; For violets suit when home birds build and sing, Not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves; Not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves, But when the green world buds to blossoming. Keep violets for the spring, and love for youth, Love that should dwell with beauty, mirth, and hope: Or if a later sadder love be born, Let this not look for grace beyond its scope, But give itself, nor plead for answering truth— A grateful Ruth tho' gleaning scanty corn. A DIRGE. Why were you born when the snow was falling? You should have come to the cuckoo's calling, Or when grapes are green in the cluster, Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster For their far off flying From summer dying. Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? You should have died at the apples' dropping, When the grasshopper comes to trouble, And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble, And all winds go sighing For sweet things dying. “THEY DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY.” I I would not if I could undo my past, Tho' for its sake my future is a blank; My past for which I have myself to thank, For all its faults and follies first and last. I would not cast anew the lot once cast, Or launch a second ship for one that sank, Or drug with sweets the bitterness I drank, Or break by feasting my perpetual fast. I would not if I could: for much more dear Is one remembrance than a hundred joys, More than a thousand hopes in jubilee; Dearer the music of one tearful voice That unforgotten calls and calls to me, “Follow me here, rise up, and follow here.” II What seekest thou, far in the unknown land? In hope I follow joy gone on before; In hope and fear persistent more and more, As the dry desert lengthens out its sand. Whilst day and night I carry in my hand The golden key to ope the golden door Of golden home; yet mine eye weepeth sore, For long the journey is that makes no stand. And who is this that veiled doth walk with thee? Lo, this is Love that walketh at my right; One exile holds us both, and we are bound To selfsame home-joys in the land of light. Weeping thou walkest with him; weepeth he?— Some sobbing weep, some weep and make no sound. III A dimness of a glory glimmers here Thro' veils and distance from the space remote, A faintest far vibration of a note Reaches to us and seems to bring us near; Causing our face to glow with braver cheer, Making the serried mist to stand afloat, Subduing languor with an antidote, And strengthening love almost to cast out fear: Till for one moment golden city walls Rise looming on us, golden walls of home, Light of our eyes until the darkness falls; Then thro' the outer darkness burdensome I hear again the tender voice that calls, “Follow me hither, follow, rise, and come.” A GREEN CORNFIELD. “And singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest.” The earth was green, the sky was blue: I saw and heard one sunny morn A skylark hang between the two, A singing speck above the corn; A stage below, in gay accord, White butterflies danced on the wing, And still the singing skylark soared And silent sank and soared to sing. The cornfield stretched a tender green To right and left beside my walks; I knew he had a nest unseen Somewhere among the million stalks: And as I paused to hear his song While swift the sunny moments slid, Perhaps his mate sat listening long, And listened longer than I did. A BRIDE SONG. Thro' the vales to my love! To the happy small nest of home Green from basement to roof; Where the honey-bees come To the window-sill flowers, And dive from above, Safe from the spider that weaves Her warp and her woof In some outermost leaves. Thro' the vales to my love! In sweet April hours All rainbows and showers, While dove answers dove,— In beautiful May, When the orchards are tender And frothing with flowers,— In opulent June, When the wheat stands up slender By sweet-smelling hay, And half the sun's splendour Descends to the moon. Thro' the vales to my love! Where the turf is so soft to the feet And the thyme makes it sweet, And the stately foxglove Hangs silent its exquisite bells; And where water wells The greenness grows greener, And bulrushes stand Round a lily to screen her. Nevertheless, if this land, Like a garden to smell and to sight, Were turned to a desert of sand; Stripped bare of delight, All its best gone to worst, For my feet no repose, No water to comfort my thirst, And heaven like a furnace above,— The desert would be As gushing of waters to me, The wilderness be as a rose, If it led me to thee, O my love. CONFLUENTS. As rivers seek the sea, Much more deep than they, So my soul seeks thee Far away: As running rivers moan On their course alone, So I moan Left alone. As the delicate rose To the sun's sweet strength Doth herself unclose, Breadth and length; So spreads my heart to thee Unveiled utterly, I to thee Utterly. As morning dew exhales Sunwards pure and free, So my spirit fails After thee: As dew leaves not a trace On the green earth's face; I, no trace On thy face. Its goal the river knows, Dewdrops find a way, Sunlight cheers the rose In her day: Shall I, lone sorrow past, Find thee at the last? Sorrow past, Thee at last? THE LOWEST ROOM. Like flowers sequestered from the sun And wind of summer, day by day I dwindled paler, whilst my hair Showed the first tinge of grey. “Oh what is life, that we should live? Or what is death, that we must die? A bursting bubble is our life: I also, what am I?” “What is your grief? now tell me, sweet, That I may grieve,” my sister said; And stayed a white embroidering hand And raised a golden head: Her tresses showed a richer mass, Her eyes looked softer than my own, Her figure had a statelier height, Her voice a tenderer tone. “Some must be second and not first; All cannot be the first of all: Is not this, too, but vanity? I stumble like to fall. “So yesterday I read the acts Of Hector and each clangorous king With wrathful great Aeacides:— Old Homer leaves a sting.” The comely face looked up again, The deft hand lingered on the thread: “Sweet, tell me what is Homer's sting, Old Homer's sting?” she said. “He stirs my sluggish pulse like wine, He melts me like the wind of spice, Strong as strong Ajax' red right hand, And grand like Juno's eyes. “I cannot melt the sons of men, I cannot fire and tempest-toss:— Besides, those days were golden days, Whilst these are days of dross.” She laughed a feminine low laugh, Yet did not stay her dexterous hand: “Now tell me of those days,” she said, “When time ran golden sand.” “Then men were men of might and right, Sheer might, at least, and weighty swords; Then men in open blood and fire Bore witness to their words, “Crest-rearing kings with whistling spears; But if these shivered in the shock They wrenched up hundred-rooted trees, Or hurled the effacing rock. “Then hand to hand, then foot to foot, Stern to the death-grip grappling then, Who ever thought of gunpowder Amongst these men of men? “They knew whose hand struck home the death, They knew who broke but would not bend, Could venerate an equal foe And scorn a laggard friend. “Calm in the utmost stress of doom, Devout toward adverse powers above, They hated with intenser hate And loved with fuller love. “Then heavenly beauty could allay As heavenly beauty stirred the strife: By them a slave was worshipped more Than is by us a wife.” She laughed again, my sister laughed; Made answer o'er the laboured cloth: “I rather would be one of us Than wife, or slave, or both.” “Oh better then be slave or wife Than fritter now blank life away: Then night had holiness of night, And day was sacred day. “The princess laboured at her loom, Mistress and handmaiden alike; Beneath their needles grew the field With warriors armed to strike. “Or, look again, dim Dian's face Gleamed perfect thro' the attendant night; Were such not better than those holes Amid that waste of white? “A shame it is, our aimless life: I rather from my heart would feed From silver dish in gilded stall With wheat and wine the steed— “The faithful steed that bore my lord In safety thro' the hostile land, The faithful steed that arched his neck To fondle with my hand.” Her needle erred; a moment's pause, A moment's patience, all was well. Then she: “But just suppose the horse, Suppose the rider fell? “Then captive in an alien house, Hungering on exile's bitter bread,— They happy, they who won the lot Of sacrifice,” she said. Speaking she faltered, while her look Showed forth her passion like a glass: With hand suspended, kindling eye, Flushed cheek, how fair she was! “Ah well, be those the days of dross; This, if you will, the age of gold: Yet had those days a spark of warmth, While these are somewhat cold— “Are somewhat mean and cold and slow, Are stunted from heroic growth: We gain but little when we prove The worthlessness of both.” “But life is in our hands,” she said: “In our own hands for gain or loss: Shall not the Sevenfold Sacred Fire Suffice to purge our dross? “Too short a century of dreams, One day of work sufficient length: Why should not you, why should not I Attain heroic strength? “Our life is given us as a blank; Ourselves must make it blest or curst: Who dooms me I shall only be The second, not the first? “Learn from old Homer, if you will, Such wisdom as his books have said: In one the acts of Ajax shine, In one of Diomed. “Honoured all heroes whose high deeds Thro' life, thro' death, enlarge their span: Only Achilles in his rage And sloth is less than man.” “Achilles only less than man? He less than man who, half a god, Discomfited all Greece with rest, Cowed Ilion with a nod? “He offered vengeance, lifelong grief To one dear ghost, uncounted price: Beasts, Trojans, adverse gods, himself, Heaped up the sacrifice. “Self-immolated to his friend, Shrined in world's wonder, Homer's page, Is this the man, the less than men Of this degenerate age?” “Gross from his acorns, tusky boar Does memorable acts like his; So for her snared offended young Bleeds the swart lioness.” But here she paused; our eyes had met, And I was whitening with the jeer; She rose: “I went too far,” she said; Spoke low: “Forgive me, dear. “To me our days seem pleasant days, Our home a haven of pure content; Forgive me if I said too much, So much more than I meant. “Homer, tho' greater than his gods, With rough-hewn virtues was sufficed And rough-hewn men: but what are such To us who learn of Christ?” The much-moved pathos of her voice, Her almost tearful eyes, her cheek Grown pale, confessed the strength of love Which only made her speak: For mild she was, of few soft words, Most gentle, easy to be led, Content to listen when I spoke And reverence what I said; I elder sister by six years; Not half so glad, or wise, or good: Her words rebuked my secret self And shamed me where I stood. She never guessed her words reproved A silent envy nursed within, A selfish, souring discontent Pride-born, the devil's sin. I smiled, half bitter, half in jest: “The wisest man of all the wise Left for his summary of life ‘Vanity of vanities.’ “Beneath the sun there's nothing new: Men flow, men ebb, mankind flows on: If I am wearied of my life, Why so was Solomon. “Vanity of vanities he preached Of all he found, of all he sought: Vanity of vanities, the gist Of all the words he taught. “This in the wisdom of the world, In Homer's page, in all, we find: As the sea is not filled, so yearns Man's universal mind. “This Homer felt, who gave his men With glory but a transient state: His very Jove could not reverse Irrevocable fate. “Uncertain all their lot save this— Who wins must lose, who lives must die: All trodden out into the dark Alike, all vanity.” She scarcely answered when I paused, But rather to herself said: “One Is here,” low-voiced and loving, “Yea, Greater than Solomon.” So both were silent, she and I: She laid her work aside, and went Into the garden-walks, like spring, All gracious with content; A little graver than her wont, Because her words had fretted me; Not warbling quite her merriest tune Bird-like from tree to tree. I chose a book to read and dream: Yet half the while with furtive eyes Marked how she made her choice of flowers Intuitively wise, And ranged them with instinctive taste Which all my books had failed to teach; Fresh rose herself, and daintier Than blossom of the peach. By birthright higher than myself, Tho' nestling of the selfsame nest: No fault of hers, no fault of mine, But stubborn to digest. I watched her, till my book unmarked Slid noiseless to the velvet floor; Till all the opulent summer-world Looked poorer than before. Just then her busy fingers ceased, Her fluttered colour went and came; I knew whose step was on the walk, Whose voice would name her name. Well, twenty years have passed since then: My sister now, a stately wife Still fair, looks back in peace and sees The longer half of life— The longer half of prosperous life, With little grief, or fear, or fret: She, loved and loving long ago, Is loved and loving yet. A husband honourable, brave, Is her main wealth in all the world: And next to him one like herself, One daughter golden-curled; Fair image of her own fair youth, As beautiful and as serene, With almost such another love As her own love has been. Yet, tho' of world-wide charity, And in her home most tender dove, Her treasure and her heart are stored In the home-land of love: She thrives, God's blessed husbandry; Most like a vine which full of fruit Doth cling and lean and climb toward heaven While earth still binds its root. I sit and watch my sister's face: How little altered since the hours When she, a kind, light-hearted girl, Gathered her garden flowers; Her song just mellowed by regret For having teased me with her talk; Then all-forgetful as she heard One step upon the walk. While I? I sat alone and watched; My lot in life, to live alone In mine own world of interests, Much felt but little shown. Not to be first: how hard to learn That lifelong lesson of the past; Line graven on line and stroke on stroke; But, thank God, learned at last. So now in patience I possess My soul year after tedious year, Content to take the lowest place, The place assigned me here. Yet sometimes, when I feel my strength Most weak, and life most burdensome, I lift mine eyes up to the hills From whence my help shall come: Yea, sometimes still I lift my heart To the Archangelic trumpet-burst, When all deep secrets shall be shown, And many last be first. DEAD HOPE. Hope new born one pleasant morn Died at even; Hope dead lives nevermore, No, not in heaven. If his shroud were but a cloud To weep itself away; Or were he buried underground To sprout some day! But dead and gone is dead and gone Vainly wept upon. Nought we place above his face To mark the spot, But it shows a barren place In our lot. Hope has birth no more on earth Morn or even; Hope dead lives nevermore, No, not in heaven. A DAUGHTER OF EVE. A fool I was to sleep at noon, And wake when night is chilly Beneath the comfortless cold moon; A fool to pluck my rose too soon, A fool to snap my lily. My garden-plot I have not kept; Faded and all-forsaken, I weep as I have never wept: Oh it was summer when I slept, It's winter now I waken. Talk what you please of future Spring And sun-warmed sweet tomorrow:— Stripped bare of hope and everything, No more to laugh, no more to sing, I sit alone with sorrow. SONG. [Oh what comes over the sea] Oh what comes over the sea, Shoals and quicksands past; And what comes home to me, Sailing slow, sailing fast? A wind comes over the sea With a moan in its blast; But nothing comes home to me, Sailing slow, sailing fast. Let me be, let me be, For my lot is cast: Land or sea all's one to me, And sail it slow or fast. VENUS'S LOOKING-GLASS. I marked where lovely Venus and her court With song and dance and merry laugh went by; Weightless, their wingless feet seemed made to fly, Bound from the ground and in mid air to sport. Left far behind I heard the dolphins snort, Tracking their goddess with a wistful eye, Around whose head white doves rose, wheeling high Or low, and cooed after their tender sort. All this I saw in Spring. Thro' Summer heat I saw the lovely Queen of Love no more. But when flushed Autumn thro' the woodlands went I spied sweet Venus walk amid the wheat: Whom seeing, every harvester gave o'er His toil, and laughed and hoped and was content. LOVE LIES BLEEDING. Love that is dead and buried, yesterday Out of his grave rose up before my face; No recognition in his look, no trace Of memory in his eyes dust-dimmed and grey. While I, remembering, found no word to say, But felt my quickened heart leap in its place; Caught afterglow, thrown back from long-set days, Caught echoes of all music passed away. Was this indeed to meet?—I mind me yet In youth we met when hope and love were quick, We parted with hope dead, but love alive: I mind me how we parted then heart-sick, Remembering, loving, hopeless, weak to strive:— Was this to meet? Not so, we have not met. BIRD RAPTURES. The sunrise wakes the lark to sing, The moonrise wakes the nightingale. Come darkness, moonrise, everything That is so silent, sweet, and pale, Come, so ye wake the nightingale. Make haste to mount, thou wistful moon, Make haste to wake the nightingale: Let silence set the world in tune To hearken to that wordless tale Which warbles from the nightingale. O herald skylark, stay thy flight One moment, for a nightingale Floods us with sorrow and delight. Tomorrow thou shalt hoist the sail; Leave us tonight the nightingale. MY FRIEND. Two days ago with dancing glancing hair, With living lips and eyes: Now pale, dumb, blind, she lies; So pale, yet still so fair. We have not left her yet, not yet alone; But soon must leave her where She will not miss our care, Bone of our bone. Weep not; O friends, we should not weep: Our friend of friends lies full of rest; No sorrow rankles in her breast, Fallen fast asleep. She sleeps below, She wakes and laughs above: Today, as she walked, let us walk in love; Tomorrow follow so. TWILIGHT NIGHT. I We met, hand to hand, We clasped hands close and fast, As close as oak and ivy stand; But it is past: Come day, come night, day comes at last. We loosed hand from hand, We parted face from face; Each went his way to his own land At his own pace, Each went to fill his separate place. If we should meet one day, If both should not forget, We shall clasp hands the accustomed way, As when we met So long ago, as I remember yet. II Where my heart is (wherever that may be) Might I but follow! If you fly thither over heath and lea, O honey-seeking bee, O careless swallow, Bid some for whom I watch keep watch for me. Alas! that we must dwell, my heart and I, So far asunder. Hours wax to days, and days and days creep by; I watch with wistful eye, I wait and wonder: When will that day draw nigh—that hour draw nigh? Not yesterday, and not, I think, today; Perhaps tomorrow. Day after day “tomorrow” thus I say: I watched so yesterday In hope and sorrow, Again today I watch the accustomed way. A BIRD SONG. It's a year almost that I have not seen her: Oh last summer green things were greener, Brambles fewer, the blue sky bluer. It's surely summer, for there's a swallow: Come one swallow, his mate will follow, The bird-race quicken and wheel and thicken. Oh happy swallow whose mate will follow O'er height, o'er hollow! I'd be a swallow To build this weather one nest together. A SMILE AND A SIGH. A smile because the nights are short! And every morning brings such pleasure Of sweet love-making, harmless sport: Love that makes and finds its treasure; Love, treasure without measure. A sigh because the days are long! Long long these days that pass in sighing, A burden saddens every song: While time lags which should be flying, We live who would be dying. AMOR MUNDI. “Oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing On the west wind blowing along this valley track?” “The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye, We shall escape the uphill by never turning back.” So they two went together in glowing August weather, The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right; And dear she was to doat on, her swift feet seemed to float on The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight. “Oh what is that in heaven where grey cloud-flakes are seven, Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?” “Oh that's a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous, An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt.” “Oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly, Their scent comes rich and sickly?”—“A scaled and hooded worm.” “Oh what's that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?” “Oh that's a thin dead body which waits the eternal term.” “Turn again, O my sweetest,—turn again, false and fleetest: This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell's own track.” “Nay, too steep for hill-mounting; nay, too late for cost-counting: This downhill path is easy, but there's no turning back.” THE GERMAN-FRENCH CAMPAIGN. 1870–1871. These two pieces, written during the suspense of a great nation's agony, aim at expressing human sympathy, not political bias. 1. “THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIETH.” All her corn-fields rippled in the sunshine, All her lovely vines, sweets-laden, bowed; Yet some weeks to harvest and to vintage: When, as one man's hand, a cloud Rose and spread, and, blackening, burst asunder In rain and fire and thunder. Is there nought to reap in the day of harvest? Hath the vine in her day no fruit to yield? Yea, men tread the press, but not for sweetness, And they reap a red crop from the field. Build barns, ye reapers, garner all aright, Tho' your souls be called tonight. A cry of tears goes up from blackened homesteads, A cry of blood goes up from reeking earth: Tears and blood have a cry that pierces Heaven Thro' all its Hallelujah swells of mirth; God hears their cry, and tho' He tarry, yet He doth not forget. Mournful Mother, prone in dust weeping Who shall comfort thee for those who are not? As thou didst, men do to thee; and heap the measure, And heat the furnace sevenfold hot: As thou once, now these to thee—who pitieth thee From sea to sea? O thou King, terrible in strength, and building Thy strong future on thy past! Tho' he drink the last, the King of Sheshach, Yet he shall drink at the last. Art thou greater than great Babylon, Which lies overthrown? Take heed, ye unwise among the people; O ye fools, when will ye understand?— He that planted the ear shall He not hear, Nor He smite who formed the hand? “Vengeance is Mine, is Mine,” thus saith the Lord:— O Man, put up thy sword. 2. “TODAY FOR ME.” She sitteth still who used to dance, She weepeth sore and more and more:— Let us sit with thee weeping sore, O fair France. She trembleth as the days advance Who used to be so light of heart:— We in thy trembling bear a part, Sister France. Her eyes shine tearful as they glance: “Who shall give back my slaughtered sons? “Bind up,” she saith, “my wounded ones.”— Alas, France! She struggles in a deathly trance, As in a dream her pulses stir, She hears the nations calling her, “France, France, France.” Thou people of the lifted lance, Forbear her tears, forbear her blood: Roll back, roll back, thy whelming flood, Back from France. Eye not her loveliness askance, Forge not for her a galling chain; Leave her at peace to bloom again, Vine-clad France. A time there is for change and chance, A time for passing of the cup: And One abides can yet bind up Broken France. A time there is for change and chance: Who next shall drink the trembling cup, Wring out its dregs and suck them up After France? A CHRISTMAS CAROL. In the bleak mid-winter Frosty wind made moan, Earth stood hard as iron, Water like a stone; Snow had fallen, snow on snow, Snow on snow, In the bleak mid-winter Long ago. Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him Nor earth sustain; Heaven and earth shall flee away When He comes to reign: In the bleak mid-winter A stable-place sufficed The Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ. Enough for Him whom cherubim Worship night and day, A breastful of milk And a mangerful of hay; Enough for Him whom angels Fall down before, The ox and ass and camel Which adore. Angels and archangels May have gathered there, Cherubim and seraphim Throng'd the air, But only His mother In her maiden bliss Worshipped the Beloved With a kiss. What can I give Him, Poor as I am? If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb, If I were a wise man I would do my part,— Yet what I can I give Him, Give my heart. CONSIDER. Consider The lilies of the field whose bloom is brief:— We are as they; Like them we fade away, As doth a leaf. Consider The sparrows of the air of small account: Our God doth view Whether they fall or mount,— He guards us too. Consider The lilies that do neither spin nor toil, Yet are most fair:— What profits all this care And all this coil? Consider The birds that have no barn nor harvest-weeks; God gives them food:— Much more our Father seeks To do us good. BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON. B.C. 570. Here, where I dwell, I waste to skin and bone; The curse is come upon me, and I waste In penal torment powerless to atone. The curse is come on me, which makes no haste And doth not tarry, crushing both the proud Hard man and him the sinner double-faced. Look not upon me, for my soul is bowed Within me, as my body in this mire; My soul crawls dumb-struck, sore bestead and cowed. As Sodom and Gomorrah scourged by fire, As Jericho before God's trumpet-peal, So we the elect ones perish in His ire. Vainly we gird on sackcloth, vainly kneel With famished faces toward Jerusalem: His heart is shut against us not to feel, His ears against our cry He shutteth them, His hand He shorteneth that He will not save, His law is loud against us to condemn: And we, as unclean bodies in the grave Inheriting corruption and the dark, Are outcast from His presence which we crave. Our Mercy hath departed from His Ark, Our Glory hath departed from His rest, Our Shield hath left us naked as a mark Unto all pitiless eyes made manifest. Our very Father hath forsaken us, Our God hath cast us from Him: we oppress'd Unto our foes are even marvellous, A hissing and a butt for pointing hands, Whilst God Almighty hunts and grinds us thus; For He hath scattered us in alien lands, Our priests, our princes, our anointed king, And bound us hand and foot with brazen bands. Here while I sit my painful heart takes wing Home to the home-land I may see no more, Where milk and honey flow, where waters spring And fail not, where I dwelt in days of yore Under my fig-tree and my fruitful vine, There where my parents dwelt at ease before: Now strangers press the olives that are mine, Reap all the corners of my harvest-field, And make their fat hearts wanton with my wine; To them my trees, to them my gardens yield Their sweets and spices and their tender green, O'er them in noontide heat outspread their shield. Yet these are they whose fathers had not been Housed with my dogs, whom hip and thigh we smote And with their blood washed their pollutions clean, Purging the land which spewed them from its throat; Their daughters took we for a pleasant prey, Choice tender ones on whom the fathers doat. Now they in turn have led our own away; Our daughters and our sisters and our wives Sore weeping as they weep who curse the day, To live, remote from help, dishonoured lives, Soothing their drunken masters with a song, Or dancing in their golden tinkling gyves: Accurst if they remember thro' the long Estrangement of their exile, twice accursed If they forget and join the accursèd throng. How doth my heart that is so wrung not burst When I remember that my way was plain, And that God's candle lit me at the first, Whilst now I grope in darkness, grope in vain, Desiring but to find Him Who is lost, To find Him once again, but once again! His wrath came on us to the uttermost, His covenanted and most righteous wrath: Yet this is He of Whom we made our boast, Who lit the Fiery Pillar in our path, Who swept the Red Sea dry before our feet, Who in His jealousy smote kings, and hath Sworn once to David: One shall fill thy seat Born of thy body, as the sun and moon 'Stablished for aye in sovereignty complete. O Lord, remember David, and that soon. The Glory hath departed, Ichabod! Yet now, before our sun grow dark at noon, Before we come to nought beneath Thy rod, Before we go down quick into the pit, Remember us for good, O God, our God:— Thy Name will I remember, praising it, Tho' Thou forget me, tho' Thou hide Thy face, And blot me from the Book which Thou hast writ; Thy Name will I remember in my praise And call to mind Thy faithfulness of old, Tho' as a weaver Thou cut off my days And end me as a tale ends that is told. PARADISE. Once in a dream I saw the flowers That bud and bloom in Paradise; More fair they are than waking eyes Have seen in all this world of ours. And faint the perfume-bearing rose, And faint the lily on its stem, And faint the perfect violet Compared with them. I heard the songs of Paradise: Each bird sat singing in his place; A tender song so full of grace It soared like incense to the skies. Each bird sat singing to his mate Soft cooing notes among the trees: The nightingale herself were cold To such as these. I saw the fourfold River flow, And deep it was, with golden sand; It flowed between a mossy land With murmured music grave and low. It hath refreshment for all thirst, For fainting spirits strength and rest; Earth holds not such a draught as this From east to west. The Tree of Life stood budding there, Abundant with its twelvefold fruits; Eternal sap sustains its roots, Its shadowing branches fill the air. Its leaves are healing for the world, Its fruit the hungry world can feed, Sweeter than honey to the taste And balm indeed. I saw the gate called Beautiful; And looked, but scarce could look within; I saw the golden streets begin, And outskirts of the glassy pool. Oh harps, oh crowns of plenteous stars, Oh green palm branches many-leaved— Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, Nor heart conceived. I hope to see these things again, But not as once in dreams by night; To see them with my very sight, And touch and handle and attain: To have all Heaven beneath my feet For narrow way that once they trod; To have my part with all the saints, And with my God. MOTHER COUNTRY. Oh what is that country And where can it be, Not mine own country, But dearer far to me? Yet mine own country, If I one day may see Its spices and cedars, Its gold and ivory. As I lie dreaming It rises, that land; There rises before me Its green golden strand, With the bowing cedars And the shining sand; It sparkles and flashes Like a shaken brand. Do angels lean nearer While I lie and long? I see their soft plumage And catch their windy song, Like the rise of a high tide Sweeping full and strong; I mark the outskirts Of their reverend throng. Oh what is a king here, Or what is a boor? Here all starve together, All dwarfed and poor; Here Death's hand knocketh At door after door, He thins the dancers From the festal floor. Oh what is a handmaid, Or what is a queen? All must lie down together Where the turf is green, The foulest face hidden, The fairest not seen; Gone as if never They had breathed or been. Gone from sweet sunshine Underneath the sod, Turned from warm flesh and blood To senseless clod, Gone as if never They had toiled or trod, Gone out of sight of all Except our God. Shut into silence From the accustomed song, Shut into solitude From all earth's throng, Run down tho' swift of foot, Thrust down tho' strong; Life made an end of Seemed it short or long. Life made an end of, Life but just begun, Life finished yesterday, Its last sand run; Life new-born with the morrow, Fresh as the sun: While done is done for ever; Undone, undone. And if that life is life, This is but a breath, The passage of a dream And the shadow of death; But a vain shadow If one considereth; Vanity of vanities, As the Preacher saith. “I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS.” I am pale with sick desire, For my heart is far away From this world's fitful fire And this world's waning day; In a dream it overleaps A world of tedious ills To where the sunshine sleeps On the everlasting hills.— Say the Saints: There Angels ease us Glorified and white. They say: We rest in Jesus, Where is not day nor night. My soul saith: I have sought For a home that is not gained, I have spent yet nothing bought, Have laboured but not attained; My pride strove to mount and grow, And hath but dwindled down; My love sought love, and lo! Hath not attained its crown.— Say the Saints: Fresh souls increase us, None languish or recede. They say: We love our Jesus, And He loves us indeed. I cannot rise above, I cannot rest beneath, I cannot find out love, Or escape from death; Dear hopes and joys gone by Still mock me with a name; My best beloved die And I cannot die with them.— Say the Saints: No deaths decrease us, Where our rest is glorious. They say: We live in Jesus, Who once died for us. O my soul, she beats her wings And pants to fly away Up to immortal things In the heavenly day: Yet she flags and almost faints; Can such be meant for me?— Come and see, say the Saints. Saith Jesus: Come and see. Say the Saints: His pleasures please us Before God and the Lamb. Come and taste My sweets, saith Jesus: Be with Me where I am. “THE MASTER IS COME, AND CALLETH FOR THEE.” Who calleth?—Thy Father calleth, Run, O Daughter, to wait on Him: He Who chasteneth but for a season Trims thy lamp that it burn not dim. Who calleth?—Thy Master calleth, Sit, Disciple, and learn of Him: He Who teacheth wisdom of Angels Makes thee wise as the Cherubim. Who calleth?—Thy Monarch calleth, Rise, O Subject, and follow Him: He is stronger than Death or Devil, Fear not thou if the foe be grim. Who calleth?—Thy Lord God calleth, Fall, O Creature, adoring Him: He is jealous, thy God Almighty, Count not dear to thee life or limb. Who calleth?—Thy Bridegroom calleth, Soar, O Bride, with the Seraphim: He Who loves thee as no man loveth, Bids thee give up thy heart to Him. WHO SHALL DELIVER ME? God strengthen me to bear myself; That heaviest weight of all to bear, Inalienable weight of care. All others are outside myself; I lock my door and bar them out, The turmoil, tedium, gad-about. I lock my door upon myself, And bar them out; but who shall wall Self from myself, most loathed of all? If I could once lay down myself, And start self-purged upon the race That all must run! Death runs apace. If I could set aside myself, And start with lightened heart upon The road by all men overgone! God harden me against myself, This coward with pathetic voice Who craves for ease, and rest, and joys: Myself, arch-traitor to myself; My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe, My clog whatever road I go. Yet One there is can curb myself, Can roll the strangling load from me, Break off the yoke and set me free. “WHEN MY HEART IS VEXED, I WILL COMPLAIN.” “O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me? Me whom Thou settest in a barren land, Hungry and thirsty on the burning sand, Hungry and thirsty where no waters be Nor shadows of date-bearing tree:— O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?” “I came from Edom by as parched a track, As rough a track beneath My bleeding feet. I came from Edom seeking thee, and sweet I counted bitterness; I turned not back But counted life as death, and trod The winepress all alone: and I am God.” “Yet, Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me? For Thou art strong to comfort: and could I But comfort one I love, who, like to die, Lifts feeble hands and eyes that fail to see In one last prayer for comfort—nay, I could not stand aside or turn away.” “Alas! thou knowest that for thee I died, For thee I thirsted with the dying thirst; I, Blessed, for thy sake was counted cursed, In sight of men and angels crucified: All this and more I bore to prove My love, and wilt thou yet mistrust My love?” “Lord, I am fain to think Thou lovest me, For Thou art all in all and I am Thine, And lo! Thy love is better than new wine, And I am sick of love in loving Thee. But dost Thou love me? speak and save, For jealousy is cruel as the grave.” “Nay, if thy love is not an empty breath My love is as thine own, deep answers deep. Peace, peace: I give to My beloved sleep, Not death but sleep, for love is strong as death: Take patience; sweet thy sleep shall be, Yea, thou shalt wake in Paradise with Me.” AFTER COMMUNION. Why should I call Thee Lord, Who art my God? Why should I call Thee Friend, Who art my Love? Or King, Who art my very Spouse above? Or call Thy Sceptre on my heart Thy rod? Lo, now Thy banner over me is love, All heaven flies open to me at Thy nod: For Thou hast lit Thy flame in me a clod, Made me a nest for dwelling of Thy Dove. What wilt Thou call me in our home above, Who now hast called me friend? how will it be When Thou for good wine settest forth the best? Now Thou dost bid me come and sup with Thee, Now Thou dost make me lean upon Thy breast: How will it be with me in time of love? SAINTS AND ANGELS. It's oh in Paradise that I fain would be, Away from earth and weariness and all beside: Earth is too full of loss with its dividing sea, But Paradise upbuilds the bower for the bride. Where flowers are yet in bud while the boughs are green, I would get quit of earth and get robed for heaven; Putting on my raiment white within the screen, Putting on my crown of gold whose gems are seven. Fair is the fourfold river that maketh no moan, Fair are the trees fruit-bearing of the wood, Fair are the gold and bdellium and the onyx stone, And I know the gold of that land is good. O my love, my dove, lift up your eyes Toward the eastern gate like an opening rose; You and I who parted will meet in Paradise, Pass within and sing when the gates unclose. This life is but the passage of a day, This life is but a pang and all is over, But in the life to come which fades not away Every love shall abide and every lover. He who wore out pleasure and mastered all lore, Solomon wrote “Vanity of vanities:” Down to death, of all that went before In his mighty long life, the record is this. With loves by the hundred, wealth beyond measure, Is this he who wrote “Vanity of vanities”? Yea, “Vanity of vanities” he saith of pleasure, And of all he learned set his seal to this. Yet we love and faint not, for our love is one, And we hope and flag not, for our hope is sure, Altho' there be nothing new beneath the sun And no help for life and for death no cure. The road to death is life, the gate of life is death, We who wake shall sleep, we shall wax who wane; Let us not vex our souls for stoppage of a breath, The fall of a river that turneth not again. Be the road short, and be the gate near,— Shall a short road tire, a strait gate appal? The loves that meet in Paradise shall cast out fear, And Paradise hath room for you and me and all. A ROSE PLANT IN JERICHO. At morn I plucked a rose and gave it Thee, A rose of joy and happy love and peace, A rose with scarce a thorn: But in the chillness of a second morn My rose bush drooped, and all its gay increase Was but one thorn that wounded me. I plucked the thorn and offered it to Thee; And for my thorn Thou gavest love and peace, Not joy this mortal morn: If Thou hast given much treasure for a thorn, Wilt Thou not give me for my rose increase Of gladness, and all sweets to me? My thorny rose, my love and pain, to Thee I offer; and I set my heart in peace, And rest upon my thorn: For verily I think tomorrow morn Shall bring me Paradise, my gift's increase, Yea, give Thy very Self to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II I Sing-Song A Nursery Rhyme Book (1872) RHYMES DEDICATED WITHOUT PERMISSION TO THE BABY WHO SUGGESTED THEM [Angels at the foot] Angels at the foot, And Angels at the head, And like a curly little lamb My pretty babe in bed. [Love me,—I love you] Love me,—I love you, Love me, my baby; Sing it high, sing it low, Sing it as may be. Mother's arms under you, Her eyes above you; Sing it high, sing it low, Love me,—I love you. [My baby has a father and a mother] My baby has a father and a mother, Rich little baby! Fatherless, motherless, I know another Forlorn as may be: Poor little baby! [Our little baby fell asleep] Our little baby fell asleep, And may not wake again For days and days, and weeks and weeks; But then he'll wake again, And come with his own pretty look, And kiss Mamma again. [“Kookoorookoo! kookoorookoo!”] “Kookoorookoo! kookoorookoo!” Crows the cock before the morn; “Kikirikee! kikirikee!” Roses in the east are born. “Kookoorookoo! kookoorookoo!” Early birds begin their singing; “Kikirikee! kikirikee!” The day, the day, the day is springing. [Baby cry—] Baby cry— Oh fie!— At the physic in the cup: Gulp it twice And gulp it thrice, Baby gulp it up. [Eight o'clock] Eight o'clock; The postman's knock! Five letters for Papa; One for Lou, And none for you, And three for dear Mamma. [Bread and milk for breakfast] Bread and milk for breakfast, And woollen frocks to wear, And a crumb for robin redbreast On the cold days of the year. [There's snow on the fields] There's snow on the fields, And cold in the cottage, While I sit in the chimney nook Supping hot pottage. My clothes are soft and warm, Fold upon fold, But I'm so sorry for the poor Out in the cold. [Dead in the cold, a song-singing thrush] Dead in the cold, a song-singing thrush, Dead at the foot of a snowberry bush,— Weave him a coffin of rush, Dig him a grave where the soft mosses grow, Raise him a tombstone of snow. [I dug and dug amongst the snow] I dug and dug amongst the snow, And thought the flowers would never grow; I dug and dug amongst the sand, And still no green thing came to hand. Melt, O snow! the warm winds blow To thaw the flowers and melt the snow; But all the winds from every land Will rear no blossom from the sand. [A city plum is not a plum] A city plum is not a plum; A dumb-bell is no bell, though dumb; A party rat is not a rat; A sailor's cat is not a cat; A soldier's frog is not a frog; A captain's log is not a log. [Your brother has a falcon] Your brother has a falcon, Your sister has a flower; But what is left for mannikin, Born within an hour? I'll nurse you on my knee, my knee, My own little son; I'll rock you, rock you, in my arms, My least little one. [Hear what the mournful linnets say] Hear what the mournful linnets say: “We built our nest compact and warm, But cruel boys came round our way And took our summerhouse by storm. “They crushed the eggs so neatly laid; So now we sit with drooping wing, And watch the ruin they have made, Too late to build, too sad to sing.” [A baby's cradle with no baby in it] A baby's cradle with no baby in it, A baby's grave where autumn leaves drop sere; The sweet soul gathered home to Paradise, The body waiting here. [Hop-o'-my-thumb and little Jack Horner] Hop-o'-my-thumb and little Jack Horner, What do you mean by tearing and fighting? Sturdy dog Trot close round the corner, I never caught him growling and biting. [Hope is like a harebell trembling from its birth] Hope is like a harebell trembling from its birth, Love is like a rose the joy of all the earth; Faith is like a lily lifted high and white, Love is like a lovely rose the world's delight; Harebells and sweet lilies show a thornless growth, But the rose with all its thorns excels them both. [O wind, why do you never rest] O wind, why do you never rest, Wandering, whistling to and fro, Bringing rain out of the west, From the dim north bringing snow? [Crying, my little one, footsore and weary?] Crying, my little one, footsore and weary? Fall asleep, pretty one, warm on my shoulder: I must tramp on through the winter night dreary, While the snow falls on me colder and colder. You are my one, and I have not another; Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure; Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother, Dreaming of pretty things, dreaming of pleasure. [Growing in the vale] Growing in the vale By the uplands hilly, Growing straight and frail, Lady Daffadowndilly. In a golden crown, And a scant green gown While the spring blows chilly, Lady Daffadown, Sweet Daffadowndilly. [A linnet in a gilded cage,—] A linnet in a gilded cage,— A linnet on a bough,— In frosty winter one might doubt Which bird is luckier now. But let the trees burst out in leaf, And nests be on the bough, Which linnet is the luckier bird, Oh who could doubt it now? [Wrens and robins in the hedge] Wrens and robins in the hedge, Wrens and robins here and there; Building, perching, pecking, fluttering, Everywhere! [My baby has a mottled fist] My baby has a mottled fist, My baby has a neck in creases; My baby kisses and is kissed, For he's the very thing for kisses. [Why did baby die] Why did baby die, Making Father sigh, Mother cry? Flowers, that bloom to die, Make no reply Of “why?” But bow and die. [If all were rain and never sun] If all were rain and never sun, No bow could span the hill; If all were sun and never rain, There'd be no rainbow still. [O wind, where have you been] O wind, where have you been, That you blow so sweet? Among the violets Which blossom at your feet. The honeysuckle waits For Summer and for heat. But violets in the chilly Spring Make the turf so sweet. [On the grassy banks] On the grassy banks Lambkins at their pranks; Woolly sisters, woolly brothers Jumping off their feet While their woolly mothers Watch by them and bleat. [Rushes in a watery place] Rushes in a watery place, And reeds in a hollow; A soaring skylark in the sky, A darting swallow; And where pale blossom used to hang Ripe fruit to follow. [Minnie and Mattie] Minnie and Mattie And fat little May, Out in the country, Spending a day. Such a bright day, With the sun glowing, And the trees half in leaf, And the grass growing. Pinky white pigling Squeals through his snout, Woolly white lambkin Frisks all about. Cluck! cluck! the nursing hen Summons her folk,— Ducklings all downy soft Yellow as yolk. Cluck! cluck! the mother hen Summons her chickens To peck the dainty bits Found in her pickings. Minnie and Mattie And May carry posies, Half of sweet violets, Half of primroses. Give the sun time enough, Glowing and glowing, He'll rouse the roses And bring them blowing. Don't wait for roses Losing today, O Minnie, Mattie, And wise little May. Violets and primroses Blossom today For Minnie and Mattie And fat little May. [Heartsease in my garden bed] Heartsease in my garden bed, With sweetwilliam white and red, Honeysuckle on my wall:— Heartsease blossoms in my heart When sweet William comes to call, But it withers when we part, And the honey-trumpets fall. [If I were a Queen] If I were a Queen, What would I do? I'd make you King, And I'd wait on you. If I were a King, What would I do? I'd make you Queen, For I'd marry you.

[There is but one May in the year] There is but one May in the year, And sometimes May is wet and cold; There is but one May in the year Before the year grows old. Yet though it be the chilliest May, With least of sun and most of showers, Its wind and dew, its night and day, Bring up the flowers. [The summer nights are short] The summer nights are short Where northern days are long: For hours and hours lark after lark Trills out his song. The summer days are short Where southern nights are long: Yet short the night when nightingales Trill out their song. [The days are clear] The days are clear, Day after day, When April's here, That leads to May, And June Must follow soon: Stay, June, stay!— If only we could stop the moon And June! [Twist me a crown of wind-flowers] Twist me a crown of wind-flowers; That I may fly away To hear the singers at their song, And players at their play. Put on your crown of wind-flowers: But whither would you go? Beyond the surging of the sea And the storms that blow. Alas! your crown of wind-flowers Can never make you fly: I twist them in a crown today, And tonight they die. [Brown and furry] Brown and furry Caterpillar in a hurry, Take your walk To the shady leaf, or stalk, Or what not, Which may be the chosen spot. No toad spy you, Hovering bird of prey pass by you; Spin and die, To live again a butterfly. [A toadstool comes up in a night,—] A toadstool comes up in a night,— Learn the lesson, little folk:— An oak grows on a hundred years, But then it is an oak. [A pocket handkerchief to hem—] A pocket handkerchief to hem— Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! How many stitches it will take Before it's done, I fear. Yet set a stitch and then a stitch, And stitch and stitch away, Till stitch by stitch the hem is done— And after work is play! [If a pig wore a wig] If a pig wore a wig, What could we say? Treat him as a gentleman, And say “Good day.” If his tail chanced to fail, What could we do?— Send him to the tailoress To get one new.

[How many seconds in a minute?] How many seconds in a minute? Sixty, and no more in it. How many minutes in an hour? Sixty for sun and shower. How many hours in a day? Twenty-four for work and play. How many days in a week? Seven both to hear and speak. How many weeks in a month? Four, as the swift moon runn'th. How many months in a year? Twelve the almanack makes clear. How many years in an age? One hundred says the sage. How many ages in time? No one knows the rhyme. [What will you give me for my pound?] What will you give me for my pound? Full twenty shillings round. What will you give me for my shilling? Twleve pence to give I'm willing. What will you give me for my penny? Four farthings, just so many. [January cold desolate] January cold desolate; February all dripping wet; March wind ranges; April changes; Birds sing in tune To flowers of May, And sunny June Brings longest day; In scorched July The storm-clouds fly Lightning torn; August bears corn, September fruit; In rough October Earth must disrobe her; Stars fall and shoot In keen November; And night is long And cold is strong In bleak December. [What is pink? a rose is pink] What is pink? a rose is pink By the fountain's brink. What is red? a poppy's red In its barley bed. What is blue? the sky is blue Where the clouds float thro'. What is white? a swan is white Sailing in the light. What is yellow? pears are yellow, Rich and ripe and mellow. What is green? the grass is green, With small flowers between. What is violet? clouds are violet In the summer twilight. What is orange? why, an orange, Just an orange! [Mother shake the cherry-tree] Mother shake the cherry-tree, Susan catch a cherry; Oh how funny that will be, Let's be merry! One for brother, one for sister, Two for mother more, Six for father, hot and tired, Knocking at the door. [A pin has a head, but has no hair] A pin has a head, but has no hair; A clock has a face, but no mouth there; Needles have eyes, but they cannot see; A fly has a trunk without lock or key; A timepiece may lose, but cannot win; A corn-field dimples without a chin; A hill has no leg, but has a foot; A wine-glass a stem, but not a root; A watch has hands, but no thumb or finger; A boot has a tongue, but is no singer; Rivers run, though they have no feet; A saw has teeth, but it does not eat; Ash-trees have keys, yet never a lock; And baby crows, without being a cock. [Hopping frog, hop here and be seen] Hopping frog, hop here and be seen, I'll not pelt you with stick or stone: Your cap is laced and your coat is green; Good bye, we'll let each other alone. Plodding toad, plod here and be looked at, You the finger of scorn is crooked at: But though you're lumpish, you're harmless too; You won't hurt me, and I won't hurt you. [Where innocent bright-eyed daisies are] Where innocent bright-eyed daisies are, With blades of grass between, Each daisy stands up like a star Out of a sky of green. [The city mouse lives in a house;—] The city mouse lives in a house;— The garden mouse lives in a bower, He's friendly with the frogs and toads, And sees the pretty plants in flower. The city mouse eats bread and cheese;— The garden mouse eats what he can; We will not grudge him seeds and stalks, Poor little timid furry man. [What does the donkey bray about?] What does the donkey bray about? What does the pig grunt through his snout? What does the goose mean by a hiss? Oh, Nurse, if you can tell me this, I'll give you such a kiss. The cockatoo calls “cockatoo,” The magpie chatters “how d'ye do?” The jackdaw bids me “go away,” Cuckoo cries “cuckoo” half the day: What do the others say? [Three plum buns] Three plum buns To eat here at the stile In the clover meadow, For we have walked a mile. One for you, and one for me, And one left over: Give it to the boy who shouts To scare sheep from the clover. [A motherless soft lambkin] A motherless soft lambkin Alone upon a hill; No mother's fleece to shelter him And wrap him from the cold:— I'll run to him and comfort him, I'll fetch him, that I will; I'll care for him and feed him Until he's strong and bold. [Dancing on the hill-tops] Dancing on the hill-tops, Singing in the valleys, Laughing with the echoes, Merry little Alice. Playing games with lambkins In the flowering valleys, Gathering pretty posies, Helpful little Alice. If her father's cottage Turned into a palace, And he owned the hill-tops And the flowering valleys, She'd be none the happier, Happy little Alice. [When fishes set umbrellas up] When fishes set umbrellas up If the rain-drops run, Lizards will want their parasols To shade them from the sun. [The peacock has a score of eyes] The peacock has a score of eyes, With which he cannot see; The cod-fish has a silent sound, However that may be; No dandelions tell the time, Although they turn to clocks; Cat's-cradle does not hold the cat, Nor foxglove fit the fox. [Pussy has a whiskered face] Pussy has a whiskered face, Kitty has such pretty ways; Doggie scampers when I call, And has a heart to love us all. [The dog lies in his kennel] The dog lies in his kennel, And Puss purrs on the rug, And baby perches on my knee For me to love and hug. Pat the dog and stroke the cat, Each in its degree; And cuddle and kiss my baby, And baby kiss me. [If hope grew on a bush] If hope grew on a bush, And joy grew on a tree, What a nosegay for the plucking There would be! But oh! in windy autumn, When frail flowers wither, What should we do for hope and joy, Fading together? [I planted a hand] I planted a hand And there came up a palm, I planted a heart And there came up balm. Then I planted a wish, But there sprang a thorn, While heaven frowned with thunder And earth sighed forlorn. [Under the ivy bush] Under the ivy bush One sits sighing, And under the willow tree One sits crying:— Under the ivy bush Cease from your sighing, But under the willow tree Lie down a-dying. [There is one that has a head without an eye] There is one that has a head without an eye, And there's one that has an eye without a head: You may find the answer if you try; And when all is said, Half the answer hangs upon a thread! [If a mouse could fly] If a mouse could fly, Or if a crow could swim, Or if a sprat could walk and talk, I'd like to be like him.

Sometimes crossing through the grass Where the dew lies pearly, They say “Good morrow” as they pass By the leafy limes. [In the meadow—what in the meadow?] In the meadow—what in the meadow? Bluebells, buttercups, meadowsweet, And fairy rings for the children's feet In the meadow. In the garden—what in the garden?

Three little children On the wide wide sea, Motherless children— Safe as safe can be With guardian Angels.

[Minnie bakes oaten cakes] Minnie bakes oaten cakes, Minnie brews ale, All because her Johnny's coming Home from sea. And she glows like a rose, Who was so pale, And “Are you sure the church clock goes?” Says she. [A white hen sitting] A white hen sitting On white eggs three: Next, three speckled chickens As plump as plump can be. An owl, and a hawk, And a bat come to see: But chicks beneath their mother's wing Squat safe as safe can be. [Currants on a bush] Currants on a bush, And figs upon a stem, And cherries on a bending bough, And Ned to gather them.

[Rosy maiden Winifred] Rosy maiden Winifred, With a milkpail on her head, Tripping through the corn, While the dew lies on the wheat In the sunny morn. Scarlet shepherd's-weatherglass Spreads wide open at her feet As they pass; Cornflowers give their almond smell While she brushes by, And a lark sings from the sky “All is well.” [When the cows come home the milk is coming] When the cows come home the milk is coming, Honey's made while the bees are humming; Duck and drake on the rushy lake, And the deer live safe in the breezy brake; And timid, funny, brisk little bunny, Winks his nose and sits all sunny. [Roses blushing red and white] Roses blushing red and white, For delight; Honeysuckle wreaths above, For love; Dim sweet-scented heliotrope, For hope; Shining lilies tall and straight, For royal state; Dusky pansies, let them be For memory; With violets of fragrant breath, For death. [“Ding a ding,”] “Ding a ding,” The sweet bells sing, And say: “Come, all be gay” For a wedding day. “Dong a dong,” The bells sigh long, And call: “Weep one, weep all” For a funeral.

A veil upon her forehead, Walks the bride, With the bridegroom proud and merry At her side. Fling flowers beneath the footsteps Of the bride; Fling flowers before the bridegroom At her side. [“Ferry me across the water] “Ferry me across the water, Do, boatman, do.” “If you've a penny in your purse I'll ferry you.” “I have a penny in my purse, And my eyes are blue; So ferry me across the water, Do, boatman, do.” “Step into my ferry-boat, Be they black or blue, And for the penny in your purse I'll ferry you.” [When a mounting skylark sings] When a mounting skylark sings In the sunlit summer morn, I know that heaven is up on high, And on earth are fields of corn. But when a nightingale sings In the moonlit summer even, I know not if earth is merely earth, Only that heaven is heaven. [Who has seen the wind?] Who has seen the wind? Neither I nor you: But when the leaves hang trembling The wind is passing thro'. Who has seen the wind? Neither you nor I: But when the trees bow down their heads The wind is passing by. [The horses of the sea] The horses of the sea Rear a foaming crest, But the horses of the land Serve us the best. The horses of the land Munch corn and clover, While the foaming sea-horses Toss and turn over. [O sailor, come ashore] O sailor, come ashore, What have you brought for me? Red coral, white coral, Coral from the sea. I did not dig it from the ground, Nor pluck it from a tree; Feeble insects made it In the stormy sea. [A diamond or a coal?] A diamond or a coal? A diamond, if you please: Who cares about a clumsy coal Beneath the summer trees? A diamond or a coal? A coal, sir, if you please: One comes to care about the coal What time the waters freeze. [An emerald is as green as grass] An emerald is as green as grass; A ruby red as blood; A sapphire shines as blue as heaven; A flint lies in the mud. A diamond is a brilliant stone, To catch the world's desire; An opal holds a fiery spark; But a flint holds fire. [Boats sail on the rivers] Boats sail on the rivers, And ships sail on the seas; But clouds that sail across the sky Are prettier far than these. There are bridges on the rivers, As pretty as you please; But the bow that bridges heaven, And overtops the trees, And builds a road from earth to sky, Is prettier far than these. [The lily has a smooth stalk] The lily has a smooth stalk, Will never hurt your hand; But the rose upon her briar Is lady of the land. There's sweetness in an apple tree, And profit in the corn; But lady of all beauty Is a rose upon a thorn. When with moss and honey She tips her bending briar, And half unfolds her glowing heart, She sets the world on fire. [Hurt no living thing] Hurt no living thing: Ladybird, nor butterfly, Nor moth with dusty wing, Nor cricket chirping cheerily, Nor grasshopper so light of leap, Nor dancing gnat, nor beetle fat, Nor harmless worms that creep. [I caught a little ladybird] I caught a little ladybird That flies far away; I caught a little lady wife That is both staid and gay. Come back, my scarlet ladybird, Back from far away; I weary of my dolly wife, My wife that cannot play. She's such a senseless wooden thing She stares the livelong day; Her wig of gold is stiff and cold And cannot change to grey.

Little Willie in his heart Is a sailor on the sea, And he often cons a chart With sister Margery. [The peach tree on the southern wall] The peach tree on the southern wall Has basked so long beneath the sun, Her score of peaches great and small Bloom rosy, every one. A peach for brothers, one for each, A peach for you and a peach for me; But the biggest, rosiest, downiest peach For Grandmamma with her tea. [A rose has thorns as well as honey] A rose has thorns as well as honey, I'll not have her for love or money; An iris grows so straight and fine, That she shall be no friend of mine; Snowdrops like the snow would chill me; Nightshade would caress and kill me; Crocus like a spear would fright me; Dragon's-mouth might bark or bite me; Convolvulus but blooms to die; A wind-flower suggests a sigh; Love-lies-bleeding makes me sad; And poppy-juice would drive me mad:— But give me holly, bold and jolly, Honest, prickly, shining holly; Pluck me holly leaf and berry For the day when I make merry. [Is the moon tired? she looks so pale] Is the moon tired? she looks so pale Within her misty veil: She scales the sky from east to west, And takes no rest. Before the coming of the night The moon shows papery white; Before the dawning of the day She fades away. [If stars dropped out of heaven] If stars dropped out of heaven, And if flowers took their place, The sky would still look very fair, And fair earth's face.

[I know a baby, such a baby,—] I know a baby, such a baby,— Round blue eyes and cheeks of pink, Such an elbow furrowed with dimples, Such a wrist where creases sink. “Cuddle and love me, cuddle and love me” Crows the mouth of coral pink: Oh the bald head, and oh the sweet lips, And oh the sleepy eyes that wink! [Lullaby, oh lullaby!] Lullaby, oh lullaby! Flowers are closed and lambs are sleeping; Lullaby, oh lullaby! Stars are up, the moon is peeping; Lullaby, oh lullaby!

II Poems Added in Sing-Song A Nursery Rhyme Book (1893) [Brownie, Brownie, let down your milk] Brownie, Brownie, let down your milk White as swansdown and smooth as silk, Fresh as dew and pure as snow: For I know where the cowslips blow, And you shall have a cowslip wreath No sweeter scented than your breath. [Stroke a flint, and there is nothing to admire] Stroke a flint, and there is nothing to admire: Strike a flint, and forthwith flash out sparks of fire. [I am a King] I am a King, Or an Emperor rather, I wear crown-imperial And prince's-feather; Golden-rod is the sceptre I wield and wag, And a broad purple flag flower Waves for my flag. Elder the pithy With old-man and sage, These are my councillors Green in old age; Lords-and-ladies in silence Stand round me and wait, While gay ragged-robin Makes bows at my gate. [Playing at bob cherry] Playing at bob cherry Tom and Nell and Hugh: Cherry bob! cherry bob! There's a bob for you. Tom bobs a cherry For gaping snapping Hugh, While curly-pated Nelly Snaps at it too. Look, look, look— Oh what a sight to see! The wind is playing cherry bob With the cherry tree. [Blind from my birth] Blind from my birth, Where flowers are springing I sit on earth All dark. Hark! hark! A lark is singing, His notes are all for me, For me his mirth:— Till some day I shall see Beautiful flowers And birds in bowers Where all Joy Bells are ringing. III A Pageant and Other Poems (1881) [Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome] Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome Has many sonnets: so here now shall be One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home, To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome; Whose service is my special dignity, And she my loadstar while I go and come. And so because you love me, and because I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honoured name: In you not fourscore years can dim the flame Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws Of time and change and mortal life and death. THE KEY-NOTE. Where are the songs I used to know, Where are the notes I used to sing? I have forgotten everything I used to know so long ago; Summer has followed after Spring; Now Autumn is so shrunk and sere, I scarcely think a sadder thing Can be the Winter of my year. Yet Robin sings thro' Winter's rest, When bushes put their berries on; While they their ruddy jewels don, He sings out of a ruddy breast; The hips and haws and ruddy breast Make one spot warm where snowflakes lie, They break and cheer the unlovely rest Of Winter's pause—and why not I? THE MONTHS: A PAGEANT. PERSONIFICATIONS. Boys. January. March. July. August. October. December. Girls. February. April. May. June. September. November. Robin Redbreasts; Lambs and Sheep; Nightingale and Nestlings. Various Flowers, Fruits, etc. Scene: A Cottage with its Grounds. [A room in a large comfortable cottage; a fire burning on the hearth; a table on which the breakfast things have been left standing. January discovered seated by the fire.] JANUARY. Cold the day and cold the drifted snow, Dim the day until the cold dark night. [Stirs the fire. Crackle, sparkle, faggot; embers glow: Some one may be plodding thro' the snow Longing for a light, For the light that you and I can show. If no one else should come, Here Robin Redbreast's welcome to a crumb, And never troublesome: Robin, why don't you come and fetch your crumb? Here's butter for my hunch of bread, And sugar for your crumb; Here's room upon the hearthrug, If you'll only come. In your scarlet waistcoat, With your keen bright eye, Where are you loitering? Wings were made to fly! Make haste to breakfast, Come and fetch your crumb, For I'm as glad to see you As you are glad to come. [Two Robin Redbreasts are seen tapping with their beaks at the lattice, which January opens. The birds flutter in, hop about the floor, and peck up the crumbs and sugar thrown to them. They have scarcely finished their meal, when a knock is heard at the door. January hangs a guard in front of the fire, and opens to February, who appears with a bunch of snowdrops in her hand.] JANUARY. Good-morrow, sister. FEBRUARY. Brother, joy to you! I've brought some snowdrops; only just a few, But quite enough to prove the world awake, Cheerful and hopeful in the frosty dew And for the pale sun's sake. [She hands a few of her snowdrops to January, who retires into the background. While February stands arranging the remaining snowdrops in a glass of water on the window-sill, a soft butting and bleating are heard outside. She opens the door, and sees one foremost lamb, with other sheep and lambs bleating and crowding towards her.] FEBRUARY. O you, you little wonder, come—come in, You wonderful, you woolly soft white lamb: You panting mother ewe, come too, And lead that tottering twin Safe in: Bring all your bleating kith and kin, Except the horny ram. [February opens a second door in the background, and the little flock files thro' into a warm and sheltered compartment out of sight.] The lambkin tottering in its walk With just a fleece to wear; The snowdrop drooping on its stalk So slender,— Snowdrop and lamb, a pretty pair, Braving the cold for our delight, Both white, Both tender. [A rattling of doors and windows; branches seen without, tossing violently to and fro.] How the doors rattle, and the branches sway! Here's brother March comes whirling on his way With winds that eddy and sing:— [She turns the handle of the door, which bursts open, and discloses March hastening up, both hands full of violets and anemones.] FEBRUARY. Come, show me what you bring; For I have said my say, fulfilled my day, And must away. MARCH. [Stopping short on the threshold.] I blow an arouse Thro' the world's wide house To quicken the torpid earth: Grappling I fling Each feeble thing, But bring strong life to the birth. I wrestle and frown, And topple down; I wrench, I rend, I uproot; Yet the violet Is born where I set The sole of my flying foot, [Hands violets and anemones to February, who retires into the background.] And in my wake Frail windflowers quake, And the catkins promise fruit. I drive ocean ashore With rush and roar, And he cannot say me nay: My harpstrings all Are the forests tall, Making music when I play. And as others perforce, So I on my course Run and needs must run, With sap on the mount And buds past count And rivers and clouds and sun, With seasons and breath And time and death And all that has yet begun. [Before March has done speaking, a voice is heard approaching accompanied by a twittering of birds. April comes along singing, and stands outside and out of sight to finish her song.] APRIL. [Outside.] Pretty little three Sparrows in a tree, Light upon the wing; Tho' you cannot sing You can chirp of Spring: Chirp of Spring to me, Sparrows, from your tree. Never mind the showers, Chirp about the flowers While you build a nest: Straws from east and west, Feathers from your breast, Make the snuggest bowers In a world of flowers. You must dart away From the chosen spray, You intrusive third Extra little bird; Join the unwedded herd! These have done with play, And must work today. APRIL. [Appearing at the open door.] Good-morrow and good-bye: if others fly, Of all the flying months you're the most flying. MARCH. You're hope and sweetness, April. APRIL. Birth means dying, As wings and wind mean flying; So you and I and all things fly or die; And sometimes I sit sighing to think of dying. But meanwhile I've a rainbow in my showers, And a lapful of flowers, And these dear nestlings aged three hours; And here's their mother sitting, Their father's merely flitting To find their breakfast somewhere in my bowers. [As she speaks April shows March her apron full of flowers and nest full of birds. March wanders away into the grounds. April, without entering the cottage, hangs over the hungry nestlings watching them.] APRIL. What beaks you have, you funny things, What voices shrill and weak; Who'd think that anything that sings Could sing thro' such a beak? Yet you'll be nightingales one day, And charm the country side, When I'm away and far away And May is queen and bride. [May arrives unperceived by April, and gives her a kiss. April starts and looks round.] APRIL. Ah May, good-morrow May, and so good-bye. MAY. That's just your way, sweet April, smile and sigh: Your sorrow's half in fun, Begun and done And turned to joy while twenty seconds run. I've gathered flowers all as I came along, At every step a flower Fed by your last bright shower,— [She divides an armful of all sorts of flowers with April, who strolls away thro' the garden.] MAY. And gathering flowers I listened to the song Of every bird in bower. The world and I are far too full of bliss To think or plan or toil or care; The sun is waxing strong, The days are waxing long, And all that is, Is fair. Here are my buds of lily and of rose, And here's my namesake blossom may; And from a watery spot See here forget-me-not, With all that blows Today. Hark to my linnets from the hedges green, Blackbird and lark and thrush and dove, And every nightingale And cuckoo tells its tale, And all they mean Is love. [June appears at the further end of the garden, coming slowly towards May, who, seeing her, exclaims] MAY. Surely you're come too early, sister June. JUNE. Indeed I feel as if I came too soon To round your young May moon And set the world a-gasping at my noon. Yet come I must. So here are strawberries Sun-flushed and sweet, as many as you please; And here are full-blown roses by the score, More roses, and yet more. [May, eating strawberries, withdraws among the flower beds.] JUNE. The sun does all my long day's work for me, Raises and ripens everything; I need but sit beneath a leafy tree And watch and sing. [Seats herself in the shadow of a laburnum. Or if I'm lulled by note of bird and bee, Or lulled by noontide's silence deep, I need but nestle down beneath my tree And drop asleep. [June falls asleep; and is not awakened by the voice of July, who behind the scenes is heard half singing, half calling.] JULY. [Behind the scenes.] Blue flags, yellow flags, flags all freckled, Which will you take? yellow, blue, speckled! Take which you will, speckled, blue, yellow, Each in its way has not a fellow. [Enter July, a basket of many-coloured irises slung upon his shoulders, a bunch of ripe grass in one hand, and a plate piled full of peaches balanced upon the other. He steals up to June, and tickles her with the grass. She wakes.] JUNE. What, here already? JULY. Nay, my tryst is kept; The longest day slipped by you while you slept. I've brought you one curved pyramid of bloom, [Hands her the plate. Not flowers but peaches, gathered where the bees, As downy, bask and boom In sunshine and in gloom of trees. But get you in, a storm is at my heels; The whirlwind whistles and wheels, Lightning flashes and thunder peals, Flying and following hard upon my heels. [June takes shelter in a thickly-woven arbour.] JULY. The roar of a storm sweeps up From the east to the lurid west, The darkening sky, like a cup, Is filled with rain to the brink; The sky is purple and fire, Blackness and noise and unrest; The earth, parched with desire, Opens her mouth to drink. Send forth thy thunder and fire, Turn over thy brimming cup, O sky, appease the desire Of earth in her parched unrest; Pour out drink to her thrist, Her famishing life lift up; Make thyself fair as at first, With a rainbow for thy crest. Have done with thunder and fire, O sky with the rainbow crest; O earth, have done with desire, Drink, and drink deep, and rest. [Enter August, carrying a sheaf made up of different kinds of grain.] JULY. Hail, brother August, flushed and warm And scatheless from my storm. Your hands are full of corn, I see, As full as hands can be: And earth and air both smell as sweet as balm In their recovered calm, And that they owe to me. [July retires into a shrubbery.] AUGUST. Wheat sways heavy, oats are airy, Barley bows a graceful head, Short and small shoots up canary, Each of these is some one's bread; Bread for man or bread for beast, Or at very least A bird's savoury feast. Men are brethren of each other, One in flesh and one in food; And a sort of foster brother Is the litter, or the brood, Of that folk in fur or feather, Who, with men together, Breast the wind and weather. [August descries September toiling across the lawn.] AUGUST. My harvest home is ended; and I spy September drawing nigh With the first thought of Autumn in her eye, And the first sigh Of Autumn wind among her locks that fly. [September arrives, carrying upon her head a basket heaped high with fruit.] SEPTEMBER. Unload me, brother. I have brought a few Plums and these pears for you, A dozen kinds of apples, one or two Melons, some figs all bursting thro' Their skins, and pearled with dew These damsons violet-blue. [While September is speaking, August lifts the basket to the ground, selects various fruits, and withdraws slowly along the gravel walk, eating a pear as he goes.] SEPTEMBER. My song is half a sigh Because my green leaves die; Sweet are my fruits, but all my leaves are dying; And well may Autumn sigh, And well may I Who watch the sere leaves flying. My leaves that fade and fall, I note you one and all; I call you, and the Autumn wind is calling, Lamenting for your fall, And for the pall You spread on earth in falling. And here's a song of flowers to suit such hours: A song of the last lilies, the last flowers, Amid my withering bowers. In the sunny garden bed Lilies look so pale, Lilies droop the head In the shady grassy vale; If all alike they pine In shade and in shine, If everywhere they grieve, Where will lilies live? [October enters briskly, some leafy twigs bearing different sorts of nuts in one hand, and a long ripe hop-bine trailing after him from the other. A dahlia is stuck in his bottonhole.] OCTOBER. Nay, cheer up sister. Life is not quite over, Even if the year has done with corn and clover, With flowers and leaves; besides, in fact it's true, Some leaves remain and some flowers too, For me and you. Now see my crops: [Offering his produce to September. I've brought you nuts and hops; And when the leaf drops, why, the walnut drops. [October wreaths the hop-bine about September's neck, and gives her the nut twigs. They enter the cottage together, but without shutting the door. She steps into the background: he advances to the hearth, removes the guard, stirs up the smouldering fire, and arranges several chestnuts ready to roast.] OCTOBER. Crack your first nut and light your first fire, Roast your first chestnut crisp on the bar; Make the logs sparkle, stir the blaze higher, Logs are cheery as sun or as star, Logs we can find wherever we are. Spring one soft day will open the leaves, Spring one bright day will lure back the flowers; Never fancy my whistling wind grieves, Never fancy I've tears in my showers; Dance, nights and days! and dance on, my hours! [Sees November approaching. OCTOBER. Here comes my youngest sister, looking dim And grim, With dismal ways. What cheer, November? NOVEMBER. [Entering and shutting the door.] Nought have I to bring Tramping a-chill and shivering, Except these pine-cones for a blaze,— Except a fog which follows, And stuffs up all the hollows,— Except a hoar frost here and there,— Except some shooting stars Which dart their luminous cars Trackless and noiseless thro' the keen night air. [October, shrugging his shoulders, withdraws into the background, while November throws her pine cones on the fire, and sits down listlessly.] NOVEMBER. The earth lies fast asleep, grown tired Of all that's high or deep; There's nought desired and nought required Save a sleep. I rock the cradle of the earth, I lull her with a sigh; And know that she will wake to mirth By and by. [Thro' the window December is seen running and leaping in the direction of the door. He knocks.] NOVEMBER. [Calls out without rising.] Ah, here's my youngest brother come at last: Come in, December. [He opens the door and enters, loaded with evergreens in berry, etc.] NOVEMBER. Come, and shut the door, For now it's snowing fast; It snows, and will snow more and more; Don't let it drift in on the floor. But you, you're all aglow; how can you be Rosy and warm and smiling in the cold? DECEMBER. Nay, no closed doors for me, But open doors and open hearts and glee To welcome young and old. Dimmest and brightest month am I; My short days end, my lengthening days begin; What matters more or less sun in the sky, When all is sun within? [He begins making a wreath as he sings. Ivy and privet dark as night, I weave with hips and haws a cheerful show, And holly for a beauty and delight, And milky mistletoe. While high above them all I set Yew twigs and Christmas roses pure and pale; Then Spring her snowdrop and her violet May keep, so sweet and frail; May keep each merry singing bird, Of all her happy birds that singing build: For I've a carol which some shepherds heard Once in a wintry field. [While December concludes his song all the other Months troop in from the garden, or advance out of the background. The Twelve join hands in a circle, and begin dancing round to a stately measure as the Curtain falls.] PASTIME. A boat amid the ripples, drifting, rocking, Two idle people, without pause or aim; While in the ominous west there gathers darkness Flushed with flame. A haycock in a hayfield backing, lapping, Two drowsy people pillowed round about; While in the ominous west across the darkness Flame leaps out. Better a wrecked life than a life so aimless, Better a wrecked life than a life so soft; The ominous west glooms thundering, with its fire Lit aloft. “ITALIA, IO TI SALUTO!” To come back from the sweet South, to the North Where I was born, bred, look to die; Come back to do my day's work in its day, Play out my play— Amen, amen, say I. To see no more the country half my own, Nor hear the half familiar speech, Amen, I say; I turn to that bleak North Whence I came forth— The South lies out of reach. But when our swallows fly back to the South, To the sweet South, to the sweet South, The tears may come again into my eyes On the old wise, And the sweet name to my mouth. MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH. The mystery of Life, the mystery Of Death, I see Darkly as in a glass; Their shadows pass, And talk with me. As the flush of a Morning Sky, As a Morning Sky colourless— Each yields its measure of light To a wet world or a dry; Each fares thro' day to night With equal pace, And then each one Is done. As the Sun with glory and grace In his face, Benignantly hot, Graciously radiant and keen, Ready to rise and to run,— Not without spot, Not even the Sun. As the Moon On the wax, on the wane, With night for her noon; Vanishing soon, To appear again. As Roses that droop Half warm, half chill, in the languid May, And breathe out a scent Sweet and faint; Till the wind gives one swoop To scatter their beauty away. As Lilies a multitude, One dipping, one rising, one sinking, On rippling waters, clear blue And pure for their drinking; One new dead, and one opened anew, And all good. As a cankered pale Flower, With death for a dower, Each hour of its life half dead; With death for a crown Weighing down Its head. As an Eagle, half strength and half grace, Most potent to face Unwinking the splendour of light; Harrying the East and the West, Soaring aloft from our sight; Yet one day or one night dropped to rest, On the low common earth Of his birth. As a Dove, Not alone, In a world of her own Full of fluttering soft noises And tender sweet voices Of love. As a Mouse Keeping house In the fork of a tree, With nuts in a crevice, And an acorn or two; What cares he For blossoming boughs, Or the song-singing bevies Of birds in their glee, Scarlet, or golden, or blue? As a Mole grubbing underground; When it comes to the light It grubs its way back again, Feeling no bias of fur To hamper it in its stir, Scant of pleasure and pain, Sinking itself out of sight Without sound. As Waters that drop and drop, Weariness without end, That drop and never stop, Wear that nothing can mend, Till one day they drop— Stop— And there's an end, And matters mend. As Trees, beneath whose skin We mark not the sap begin To swell and rise, Till the whole bursts out in green: We mark the falling leaves When the wide world grieves And sighs. As a Forest on fire, Where maddened creatures desire Wet mud or wings Beyond all those things Which could assauge desire On this side the flaming fire. As Wind with a sob and sigh To which there comes no reply But a rustle and shiver From rushes of the river; As Wind with a desolate moan, Moaning on alone. As a Desert all sand, Blank, neither water nor land For solace, or dwelling, or culture, Where the storms and the wild creatures howl; Given over to lion and vulture, To ostrich, and jackal, and owl: Yet somewhere an oasis lies; There waters arise To nourish one seedling of balm, Perhaps, or one palm. As the Sea, Murmuring, shifting, swaying; One time sunnily playing, One time wrecking and slaying; In whichever mood it be, Worst or best, Never at rest. As still Waters and deep, As shallow Waters that brawl, As rapid Waters that leap To their fall. As Music, as Colour, as Shape, Keys of rapture and pain Turning in vain In a lock which turns not again, While breaths and moments escape. As Spring, all bloom and desire; As Summer, all gift and fire; As Autumn, a dying glow; As Winter, with nought to show: Winter which lays its dead all out of sight, All clothed in white, All waiting for the long-awaited light. A BALLAD OF BODING. There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams; What seems is not always as it seems. I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning, And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning Went sailing toward the East: The first had sails like fire, The next like glittering wire, But sackcloth were the sails of the least; And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast. The first choir breathed in flutes, And fingered soft guitars; The second won from lutes Harmonious chords and jars, With drums for stormy bars: But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpters; Notes of triumph, then An alarm again, As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs, Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers. The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings; The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings; The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings. The first bore for freight gold and spice and down; The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown; The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown. Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face; Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place; Lily and Rose were flowers of grace. Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew, Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro: Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new; Sighs, but scarce of woe; All the sighing Wooed such sweet replying; All the sighing, sweet and low, Used to come and go For more pleasure, merely so. Yet at intervals some one grew tired Of everything desired, And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight, Out of sight. The second crew seemed ever Wider-visioned, graver, More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will; With heads erect and proud, And voices sometimes loud; With endless tacking, counter-tacking, All things grasping, all things lacking, It would seem; Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud, Drifting on as in a dream. Hoarding to their utmost bent, Feasting to their fill, Yet gnawed by discontent, Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went. Their freight was not a treasure, Their music not a pleasure; The sword flashed, cleaving thro' their bands, Sceptre and crown changed hands. The third crew as they went Seemed mostly different; They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary, As all the world might see. They laboured at the oar, While on their heads they bore The fiery stress of sunshine more and more. They laboured at the oar hand-sore, Till rain went splashing, And spray went dashing, Down on them, and up on them, more and more. Their sails were patched and rent, Their masts were bent, In peril of their lives they worked and went. For them no feast was spread, No soft luxurious bed Scented and white, No crown or sceptre hung in sight; In weariness and painfulness, In thirst and sore distress, They rowed and steered from left to right With all their might. Their trumpeters and harpers round about Incessantly played out, And sometimes they made answer with a shout; But oftener they groaned or wept, And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept. I wept for pity watching them, but more I wept heart-sore Once and again to see Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly: And there all welcomed him. The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other, Yet all the crews were interchangeable; Now one man, now another, —Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,— Changed openly, or changed by stealth, Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well. The most left Love ship, hauling wealth Up Worm ship's side; While some few hollow-eyed Left either for the sack-sailed boat; But this, tho' not remote, Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once Scarce ever came again, But seemed to loathe his erst companions, And wish and work them bane. Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread, Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water bed, Whence a waterspout Instantaneously leaped out, Roaring as it reared its head. Soon I spied a something dim, Many-handed, grim, That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship; It puffed their sails full out With puffs of smoky breath From a smouldering lip, And cleared the waterspout Which reeled roaring round about Threatening death. With a horny hand it steered, And a horn appeared On its sneering head upreared Haughty and high Against the blackening lowering sky. With a hoof it swayed the waves; They opened here and there, Till I spied deep ocean graves Full of skeletons That were men and women once Foul or fair; Full of things that creep And fester in the deep And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air. The third bark held aloof From the Monster with the hoof, Despite his urgent beck, And fraught with guile Abominable his smile; Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck. Then full of awe, With these same eyes I saw His head incredible retract its horn Rounding like babe's new born, While silvery phosphorescence played About his dis-horned head. The sneer smoothed from his lip, He beamed blandly on the ship; All winds sank to a moan, All waves to a monotone (For all these seemed his realm), While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm. Then a cry well nigh of despair Shrieked to heaven, a clamour of desperate prayer. The harpers harped no more, While the trumpeters sounded sore, An alarm to wake the dead from their bed: To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never, To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead, Or no more help or hope for ever!— The planks strained as tho' they must part asunder, The masts bent as tho' they must dip under, And the winds and the waves at length Girt up their strength, And the depths were laid bare, And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder Thro' the rain-choked air, And sea and sky seemed to kiss In the horror and the hiss Of the whole world shuddering everywhere. Lo! a Flyer swooping down With wings to span the globe, And splendour for his robe And splendour for his crown. He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire, And spun the Monster overboard: And that monstrous thing abhorred, Gnashing with balked desire, Wriggled like a worm infirm Up the Worm Of the loathly figurehead. There he crouched and gnashed; And his head re-horned, and gashed From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red. I saw that thing accurst Wreak his worst On the first and second crew: Some with baited hook He angled for and took, Some dragged overboard in a net he threw, Some he did to death With hoof or horn or blasting breath. I heard a voice of wailing Where the ships went sailing, A sorrowful voice prevailing Above the sound of the sea, Above the singers' voices, And musical merry noises; All songs had turned to sighing, The light was failing, The day was dying— Ah me, That such a sorrow should be! There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand To its grave in the bitter wave. There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand, And the bitter wave was its grave. But land and sea waxed hoary In whiteness of a glory Never told in story Nor seen by mortal eye, When the third ship crossed the bar Where whirls and breakers are, And steered into the splendours of the sky; That third bark and that least Which had never seemed to feast, Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star. YET A LITTLE WHILE. I dreamed and did not seek: today I seek Who can no longer dream; But now am all behindhand, waxen weak, And dazed amid so many things that gleam Yet are not what they seem. I dreamed and did not work: today I work Kept wide awake by care And loss, and perils dimly guessed to lurk; I work and reap not, while my life goes bare And void in wintry air. I hope indeed; but hope itself is fear Viewed on the sunny side; I hope, and disregard the world that's here, The prizes drawn, the sweet things that betide; I hope, and I abide. HE AND SHE. “Should one of us remember, And one of us forget, I wish I knew what each will do— But who can tell as yet?” “Should one of us remember, And one of us forget, I promise you what I will do— And I'm content to wait for you, And not be sure as yet.” MONNA INNOMINATA. A Sonnet Of Sonnets. Beatrice, immortalized by “altissimo poeta . . . cotanto amante”; Laura, celebrated by a great tho' an inferior bard,— have alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honour, and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness. These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy of unnamed ladies “donne innominate” sung by a school of less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual love incompatible with mutual honour. Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn even by a devoted friend. Or had the Great Poetess of our own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in lieu of the “Portuguese Sonnets,” an inimitable “donna innominata” drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura. 1. “Lo dì che han detto a' dolci amici addio.” —Dante. “Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci!” —Petrarca. Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:— Or come not yet, for it is over then, And long it is before you come again, So far between my pleasures are and few. While, when you come not, what I do I do Thinking “Now when he comes,” my sweetest “when:” For one man is my world of all the men This wide world holds; O love, my world is you. Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang Because the pang of parting comes so soon; My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon Between the heavenly days on which we meet: Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang When life was sweet because you called them sweet? 2. “Era già l'ora che volge il desio.” —Dante. “Ricorro al tempo ch'io vi vidi prima.” —Petrarca. I wish I could remember, that first day, First hour, first moment of your meeting me, If bright or dim the season, it might be Summer or Winter for aught I can say; So unrecorded did it slip away, So blind was I to see and to foresee, So dull to mark the budding of my tree That would not blossom yet for many a May. If only I could recollect it, such A day of days! I let it come and go As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow; It seemed to mean so little, meant so much; If only now I could recall that touch, First touch of hand in hand—Did one but know! 3. “O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!” —Dante. “Immaginata guida la conduce.” —Petrarca. I dream of you to wake: would that I might Dream of you and not wake but slumber on; Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone, As Summer ended Summer birds take flight. In happy dreams I hold you full in sight, I blush again who waking look so wan; Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone, In happy dreams your smile makes day of night. Thus only in a dream we are at one, Thus only in a dream we give and take The faith that maketh rich who take or give; If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake, To die were surely sweeter than to live, Tho' there be nothing new beneath the sun. 4. “Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda.” —Dante. “Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore, E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.” —Petrarca. I loved you first: but afterwards your love Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove. Which owes the other most? my love was long, And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong; I loved and guessed at you, you construed me And loved me for what might or might not be— Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. For verily love knows not “mine” or “thine;” With separate “I” and “thou” free love has done, For one is both and both are one in love: Rich love knows nought of “thine that is not mine;” Both have the strength and both the length thereof, Both of us, of the love which makes us one. 5. “Amor che a nulla amato amar perdona.” —Dante. “Amor m'addusse in sì gioiosa spene.” —Petrarca. O my heart's heart, and you who are to me More than myself myself, God be with you, Keep you in strong obedience leal and true To Him whose noble service setteth free, Give you all good we see or can foresee, Make your joys many and your sorrows few, Bless you in what you bear and what you do, Yea, perfect you as He would have you be. So much for you; but what for me, dear friend? To love you without stint and all I can Today, tomorrow, world without an end; To love you much and yet to love you more, As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore; Since woman is the helpmeet made for man. 6. “Or puoi la quantitate Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda.” —Dante. “Non vo'che da tal nodo amor mi scioglia.” —Petrarca. Trust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke, I love, as you would have me, God the most; Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost, Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look Unready to forego what I forsook; This say I, having counted up the cost, This, tho' I be the feeblest of God's host, The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook. Yet while I love my God the most, I deem That I can never love you overmuch; I love Him more, so let me love you too; Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such I cannot love you if I love not Him, I cannot love Him if I love not you. 7. “Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto.” —Dante. “Ragionando con meco ed io con lui.” —Petrarca. “Love me, for I love you”—and answer me, “Love me, for I love you”—so shall we stand As happy equals in the flowering land Of love, that knows not a dividing sea. Love builds the house on rock and not on sand, Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately; And who hath found love's citadel unmanned? And who hath held in bonds love's liberty? My heart's a coward tho' my words are brave— We meet so seldom, yet we surely part So often; there's a problem for your art! Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith, Tho' jealousy be cruel as the grave, And death be strong, yet love is strong as death. 8. “Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.” —Dante. “Spero trovar pietà non che perdono.” —Petrarca. “I, if I perish, perish”—Esther spake: And bride of life or death she made her fair In all the lustre of her perfumed hair And smiles that kindle longing but to slake. She put on pomp of loveliness, to take Her husband thro' his eyes at unaware; She spread abroad her beauty for a snare, Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake. She trapped him with one mesh of silken hair, She vanquished him by wisdom of her wit, And built her people's house that it should stand:— If I might take my life so in my hand, And for my love to Love put up my prayer, And for love's sake by Love be granted it! 9. “O dignitosa coscienza e netta!” —Dante. “Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti.” —Petrarca. Thinking of you, and all that was, and all That might have been and now can never be, I feel your honoured excellence, and see Myself unworthy of the happier call: For woe is me who walk so apt to fall, So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee, Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!) Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall. And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite, Because not loveless; love may toil all night, But take at morning; wrestle till the break Of day, but then wield power with God and man:— So take I heart of grace as best I can, Ready to spend and be spent for your sake. 10. “Con miglior corso e con migliore stella.” —Dante. “La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.” —Petrarca. Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing; Death following hard on life gains ground apace; Faith runs with each and rears an eager face, Outruns the rest, makes light of everything, Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing; While love ahead of all uplifts his praise, Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace, Content with all day brings and night will bring. Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse, Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace: A little while, and age and sorrow cease; A little while, and life reborn annuls Loss and decay and death, and all is love. 11. “Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti.” —Dante. “Contando i casi della vita nostra.” —Petrarca. Many in aftertimes will say of you “He loved her”—while of me what will they say? Not that I loved you more than just in play, For fashion's sake as idle women do. Even let them prate; who know not what we knew Of love and parting in exceeding pain, Of parting hopeless here to meet again, Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view. But by my heart of love laid bare to you, My love that you can make not void nor vain, Love that foregoes you but to claim anew Beyond this passage of the gate of death, I charge you at the Judgment make it plain My love of you was life and not a breath. 12. “Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona.” —Dante. “Amor vien nel bel viso di costei.” —Petrarca. If there be any one can take my place And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve, Think not that I can grudge it, but believe I do commend you to that nobler grace, That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face; Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive I too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave, And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace. For if I did not love you, it might be That I should grudge you some one dear delight; But since the heart is yours that was mine own, Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right, Your honourable freedom makes me free, And you companioned I am not alone. 13. “E drizzeremo glí occhi al Primo Amore.” —DANTE. “Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia.” —PETRARCA. If I could trust mine own self with your fate, Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand? Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand, Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date; Who numbereth the innumerable sand, Who weighs the wind and water with a weight, To Whom the world is neither small nor great, Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned. Searching my heart for all that touches you, I find there only love and love's goodwill Helpless to help and impotent to do, Of understanding dull, of sight most dim; And therefore I commend you back to Him Whose love your love's capacity can fill. 14. “E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace.” —Dante. “Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.” —Petrarca. Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this; Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss? I will not bind fresh roses in my hair, To shame a cheek at best but little fair,— Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,— I will not seek for blossoms anywhere, Except such common flowers as blow with corn. Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain? The longing of a heart pent up forlorn, A silent heart whose silence loves and longs; The silence of a heart which sang its songs While youth and beauty made a summer morn, Silence of love that cannot sing again. “LUSCIOUS AND SORROWFUL.” Beautiful, tender, wasting away for sorrow; Thus today; and how shall it be with thee tomorrow? Beautiful, tender—what else? A hope tells. Beautiful, tender, keeping the jubilee In the land of home together, past death and sea; No more change or death, no more Salt sea-shore. DE PROFUNDIS. Oh why is heaven built so far, Oh why is earth set so remote? I cannot reach the nearest star That hangs afloat. I would not care to reach the moon, One round monotonous of change; Yet even she repeats her tune Beyond my range. I never watch the scattered fire Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train, But all my heart is one desire, And all in vain: For I am bound with fleshly bands, Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope; I strain my heart, I stretch my hands, And catch at hope. TEMPUS FUGIT. Lovely Spring, A brief sweet thing, Is swift on the wing; Gracious Summer, A slow sweet comer, Hastens past; Autumn while sweet Is all incomplete With a moaning blast,— Nothing can last, Can be cleaved unto, Can be dwelt upon; It is hurried thro', It is come and gone, Undone it cannot be done, It is ever to do, Ever old, ever new, Ever waxing old And lapsing to Winter cold. GOLDEN GLORIES. The buttercup is like a golden cup, The marigold is like a golden frill, The daisy with a golden eye looks up, And golden spreads the flag beside the rill, And gay and golden nods the daffodil, The gorsey common swells a golden sea, The cowslip hangs a head of golden tips, And golden drips the honey which the bee Sucks from sweet hearts of flowers and stores and sips. JOHNNY. Founded On An Anecdote Of The First French Revolution. Johnny had a golden head Like a golden mop in blow, Right and left his curls would spread In a glory and a glow, And they framed his honest face Like stray sunbeams out of place. Long and thick, they half could hide How threadbare his patched jacket hung; They used to be his Mother's pride; She praised them with a tender tongue, And stroked them with a loving finger That smoothed and stroked and loved to linger. On a doorstep Johnny sat, Up and down the street looked he; Johnny did not own a hat, Hot or cold tho' days might be; Johnny did not own a boot To cover up his muddy foot. Johnny's face was pale and thin, Pale with hunger and with crying; For his Mother lay within, Talked and tossed and seemed a-dying, While Johnny racked his brains to think How to get her help and drink, Get her physic, get her tea, Get her bread and something nice; Not a penny piece had he, And scarce a shilling might suffice; No wonder that his soul was sad, When not one penny piece he had. As he sat there thinking, moping, Because his Mother's wants were many, Wishing much but scarcely hoping To earn a shilling or a penny, A friendly neighbour passed him by And questioned him: Why did he cry? Alas! his trouble soon was told: He did not cry for cold or hunger, Tho' he was hungry both and cold; He only felt more weak and younger, Because he wished so to be old And apt at earning pence or gold. Kindly that neighbour was, but poor, Scant coin had he to give or lend; And well he guessed there needed more Than pence or shillings to befriend The helpless woman in her strait, So much loved, yet so desolate. One way he saw, and only one: He would—he could not—give the advice, And yet he must: the widow's son Had curls of gold would fetch their price; Long curls which might be clipped, and sold For silver, or perhaps for gold. Our Johnny, when he understood Which shop it was that purchased hair, Ran off as briskly as he could, And in a trice stood cropped and bare, Too short of hair to fill a locket, But jingling money in his pocket. Precious money—tea and bread, Physic, ease, for Mother dear, Better than a golden head: Yet our hero dropped one tear When he spied himself close shorn, Barer much than lamb new born. His Mother throve upon the money, Ate and revived and kissed her son: But oh! when she perceived her Johnny, And understood what he had done All and only for her sake, She sobbed as if her heart must break. “HOLLOW-SOUNDING AND MYSTERIOUS.” There's no replying To the Wind's sighing, Telling, foretelling, Dying, undying, Dwindling and swelling, Complaining, droning, Whistling and moaning, Ever beginning, Ending, repeating, Hinting and dinning, Lagging and fleeting— We've no replying Living or dying To the Wind's sighing. What are you telling, Variable Wind-tone? What would be teaching, O sinking, swelling, Desolate Wind-moan? Ever for ever Teaching and preaching, Never, ah never Making us wiser— The earliest riser Catches no meaning, The last who hearkens Garners no gleaning Of wisdom's treasure, While the world darkens:— Living or dying, In pain, in pleasure, We've no replying To wordless flying Wind's sighing. MAIDEN MAY. Maiden May sat in her bower, In her blush rose bower in flower, Sweet of scent; Sat and dreamed away an hour, Half content, half uncontent. “Why should rose blossoms be born, Tender blossoms, on a thorn Tho' so sweet? Never a thorn besets the corn Scentless in its strength complete. “Why are roses all so frail, At the mercy of a gale, Of a breath? Yet so sweet and perfect pale, Still so sweet in life and death.” Maiden May sat in her bower, In her blush rose bower in flower, Where a linnet Made one bristling branch the tower For her nest and young ones in it. “Gay and clear the linnet trills; Yet the skylark only, thrills Heaven and earth When he breasts the height, and fills Height and depth with song and mirth. “Nightingales which yield to night Solitary strange delight, Reign alone: But the lark for all his height Fills no solitary throne; “While he sings, a hundred sing; Wing their flight below his wing Yet in flight; Each a lovely joyful thing To the measure of its delight. “Why then should a lark be reckoned One alone, without a second Near his throne? He in skyward flight unslackened, In his music, not alone.” Maiden May sat in her bower; Her own face was like a flower Of the prime, Half in sunshine, half in shower, In the year's most tender time. Her own thoughts in silent song Musically flowed along, Wise, unwise, Wistful, wondering, weak or strong: As brook shallows sink or rise. Other thoughts another day, Maiden May, will surge and sway Round your heart; Wake, and plead, and turn at bay, Wisdom part, and folly part. Time not far remote will borrow Other joys, another sorrow, All for you; Not today, and yet tomorrow Reasoning false and reasoning true. Wherefore greatest? Wherefore least? Hearts that starve and hearts that feast? You and I? Stammering Oracles have ceased, And the whole earth stands at “why?” Underneath all things that be Lies an unsolved mystery; Over all Spreads a veil impenetrably, Spreads a dense unlifted pall. Mystery of mysteries: This creation hears and sees High and low— Vanity of vanities: This we test and this we know. Maiden May, the days of flowering Nurse you now in sweet embowering, Sunny days; Bright with rainbows all the showering, Bright with blossoms all the ways. Close the inlet of your bower, Close it close with thorn and flower, Maiden May; Lengthen out the shortening hour,— Morrows are not as today. Stay today which wanes too soon, Stay the sun and stay the moon, Stay your youth; Bask you in the actual noon, Rest you in the present truth. Let today suffice today: For itself tomorrow may Fetch its loss, Aim and stumble, say its say, Watch and pray and bear its cross. TILL TOMORROW. Long have I longed, till I am tired Of longing and desire; Farewell my points in vain desired, My dying fire; Farewell all things that die and fail and tire. Springtide and youth and useless pleasure And all my useless scheming, My hopes of unattainable treasure, Dreams not worth dreaming, Glow-worms that gleam but yield no warmth in gleaming, Farewell all shows that fade in showing: My wish and joy stand over Until tomorrow; Heaven is glowing Thro' cloudy cover, Beyond all clouds loves me my Heavenly Lover. DEATH-WATCHES. The Spring spreads one green lap of flowers Which Autumn buries at the fall, No chilling showers of Autumn hours Can stay them or recall; Winds sing a dirge, while earth lays out of sight Her garment of delight. The cloven East brings forth the sun, The cloven West doth bury him What time his gorgeous race is run And all the world grows dim; A funeral moon is lit in heaven's hollow, And pale the star-lights follow. TOUCHING “NEVER.” Because you never yet have loved me, dear, Think you you never can nor ever will? Surely while life remains hope lingers still, Hope the last blossom of life's dying year. Because the season and mine age grow sere, Shall never Spring bring forth her daffodil, Shall never sweeter Summer feast her fill Of roses with the nightingales they hear? If you had loved me, I not loving you, If you had urged me with the tender plea Of what our unknown years to come might do (Eternal years, if Time should count too few), I would have owned the point you pressed on me, Was possible, or probable, or true. BRANDONS BOTH. Oh fair Milly Brandon, a young maid, a fair maid! All her curls are yellow and her eyes are blue, And her cheeks were rosy red till a secret care made Hollow whiteness of their brightness as a care will do. Still she tends her flowers, but not as in the old days, Still she sings her songs, but not the songs of old: If now it be high Summer her days seem brief and cold days, If now it be high Summer her nights are long and cold. If you have a secret keep it, pure maid Milly; Life is filled with troubles and the world with scorn; And pity without love is at best times hard and chilly, Chilling sore and stinging sore a heart forlorn. Walter Brandon, do you guess Milly Brandon's secret? Many things you know, but not everything, With your locks like raven's plumage, and eyes like an egret, And a laugh that is music, and such a voice to sing. Nelly Knollys, she is fair, but she is not fairer Than fairest Milly Brandon was before she turned so pale: Oh, but Nelly's dearer if she be not rarer, She need not keep a secret or blush behind a veil. Beyond the first green hills, beyond the nearest valleys, Nelly dwells at home beneath her mother's eyes: Her home is neat and homely, not a cot and not a palace, Just the home where love sets up his happiest memories. Milly has no mother; and sad beyond another Is she whose blessed mother is vanished out of call: Truly comfort beyond comfort is stored up in a Mother Who bears with all, and hopes thro' all, and loves us all. Where peacocks nod and flaunt up and down the terrace, Furling and unfurling their scores of sightless eyes, To and fro among the leaves and buds and flowers and berries Maiden Milly strolls and pauses, smiles and sighs. On the hedged-in terrace of her father's palace She may stroll and muse alone, may smile or sigh alone, Letting thoughts and eyes go wandering over hills and valleys Today her father's, and one day to be all her own. If her thoughts go coursing down lowlands and up highlands, It is because the startled game are leaping from their lair; If her thoughts dart homeward to the reedy river islands, It is because the waterfowl rise startled here or there. At length a footfall on the steps: she turns, composed and steady, All the long-descended greatness of her father's house Lifting up her head; and there stands Walter keen and ready For hunting or for hawking, a flush upon his brows. “Good-morrow, fair cousin.” “Good-morrow, fairest cousin: The sun has started on his course, and I must start today. If you have done me one good turn you've done me many a dozen, And I shall often think of you, think of you away.” “Over hill and hollow what quarry will you follow, Or what fish will you angle for beside the river's edge? There's cloud upon the hill-top and there's mist deep down the hollow, And fog among the rushes and the rustling sedge.” “I shall speed well enough be it hunting or hawking, Or casting a bait toward the shyest daintiest fin. But I kiss your hands, my cousin; I must not loiter talking, For nothing comes of nothing, and I'm fain to seek and win.” “Here's a thorny rose: will you wear it an hour, Till the petals drop apart still fresh and pink and sweet? Till the petals drop from the drooping perished flower, And only the graceless thorns are left of it.” “Nay, I have another rose sprung in another garden, Another rose which sweetens all the world for me. Be you a tenderer mistress and be you a warier warden Of your rose, as sweet as mine, and full as fair to see.” “Nay, a bud once plucked there is no reviving, Nor is it worth your wearing now, nor worth indeed my own; The dead to the dead, and the living to the living. It's time I go within, for it's time now you were gone.” “Good-bye, Milly Brandon, I shall not forget you, Tho' it be good-bye between us for ever from today; I could almost wish today that I had never met you, And I'm true to you in this one word that I say.” “Good-bye, Walter. I can guess which thornless rose you covet; Long may it bloom and prolong its sunny morn: Yet as for my one thorny rose, I do not cease to love it, And if it is no more a flower I love it as a thorn.” A LIFE'S PARALLELS. Never on this side of the grave again, On this side of the river, On this side of the garner of the grain, Never,— Ever while time flows on and on and on, That narrow noiseless river, Ever while corn bows heavy-headed, wan, Ever,— Never despairing, often fainting, rueing, But looking back, ah never! Faint yet pursuing, faint yet still pursuing Ever. AT LAST. Many have sung of love a root of bane: While to my mind a root of balm it is, For love at length breeds love; sufficient bliss For life and death and rising up again. Surely when light of Heaven makes all things plain, Love will grow plain with all its mysteries; Nor shall we need to fetch from over seas Wisdom or wealth or pleasure safe from pain. Love in our borders, love within our heart, Love all in all, we then shall bide at rest, Ended for ever life's unending quest, Ended for ever effort, change and fear: Love all in all;—no more that better part Purchased, but at the cost of all things here. GOLDEN SILENCES. There is silence that saith, “Ah me!” There is silence that nothing saith; One the silence of life forlorn, One the silence of death; One is, and the other shall be. One we know and have known for long, One we know not, but we shall know, All we who have ever been born; Even so, be it so,— There is silence, despite a song. Sowing day is a silent day, Resting night is a silent night; But whoso reaps the ripened corn Shall shout in his delight, While silences vanish away. IN THE WILLOW SHADE. I sat beneath a willow tree, Where water falls and calls; While fancies upon fancies solaced me, Some true, and some were false. Who set their heart upon a hope That never comes to pass, Droop in the end like fading heliotrope The sun's wan looking-glass. Who set their will upon a whim Clung to thro' good and ill, Are wrecked alike whether they sink or swim, Or hit or miss their will. All things are vain that wax and wane, For which we waste our breath; Love only doth not wane and is not vain, Love only outlives death. A singing lark rose toward the sky, Circling he sang amain; He sang, a speck scarce visible sky-high, And then he sank again. A second like a sunlit spark Flashed singing up his track; But never overtook that foremost lark, And songless fluttered back. A hovering melody of birds Haunted the air above; They clearly sang contentment without words, And youth and joy and love. O silvery weeping willow tree With all leaves shivering, Have you no purpose but to shadow me Beside this rippled spring? On this first fleeting day of Spring, For Winter is gone by, And every bird on every quivering wing Floats in a sunny sky; On this first Summer-like soft day, While sunshine steeps the air, And every cloud has gat itself away, And birds sing everywhere. Have you no purpose in the world But thus to shadow me With all your tender drooping twigs unfurled, O weeping willow tree? With all your tremulous leaves outspread Betwixt me and the sun, While here I loiter on a mossy bed With half my work undone; My work undone, that should be done At once with all my might; For after the long day and lingering sun Comes the unworking night. This day is lapsing on its way, Is lapsing out of sight; And after all the chances of the day Comes the resourceless night. The weeping willow shook its head And stretched its shadow long; The west grew crimson, the sun smouldered red, The birds forbore a song. Slow wind sighed thro' the willow leaves, The ripple made a moan, The world drooped murmuring like a thing that grieves; And then I felt alone. I rose to go, and felt the chill, And shivered as I went; Yet shivering wondered, and I wonder still, What more that willow meant; That silvery weeping willow tree With all leaves shivering, Which spent one long day overshadowing me Beside a spring in Spring. FLUTTERED WINGS. The splendour of the kindling day, The splendour of the setting sun, These move my soul to wend its way, And have done With all we grasp and toil amongst and say. The paling roses of a cloud, The fading bow that arches space, These woo my fancy toward my shroud; Toward the place Of faces veiled, and heads discrowned and bowed. The nation of the steadfast stars, The wandering star whose blaze is brief, These make me beat against the bars Of my grief; My tedious grief, twin to the life it mars. O fretted heart tossed to and fro, So fain to flee, so fain to rest! All glories that are high or low, East or west, Grow dim to thee who art so fain to go. A FISHER-WIFE. The soonest mended, nothing said; And help may rise from east or west; But my two hands are lumps of lead, My heart sits leaden in my breast. O north wind swoop not from the north, O south wind linger in the south, Oh come not raving raging forth, To bring my heart into my mouth; For I've a husband out at sea, Afloat on feeble planks of wood; He does not know what fear may be; I would have told him if I could. I would have locked him in my arms, I would have hid him in my heart; For oh! the waves are fraught with harms, And he and I so far apart. WHAT'S IN A NAME? Why has Spring one syllable less Than any its fellow season? There may be some other reason, And I'm merely making a guess; But surely it hoards such wealth Of happiness, hope and health, Sunshine and musical sound, It may spare a foot from its name Yet all the same Superabound. Soft-named Summer, Most welcome comer, Brings almost everything Over which we dream or sing Or sigh; But then summer wends its way, Tomorrow,—today,— Good-bye! Autumn,—the slow name lingers, While we likewise flag; It silences many singers; Its slow days drag, Yet hasten at speed To leave us in chilly need For Winter to strip indeed. In all-lack Winter, Dull of sense and of sound, We huddle and shiver Beside our splinter Of crackling pine, Snow in sky and snow on ground. Winter and cold Can't last for ever! Today, tomorrow, the sun will shine; When we are old, But some still are young, Singing the song Which others have sung, Ringing the bells Which others have rung,— Even so! We ourselves, who else? We ourselves long Long ago. MARIANA. Not for me marring or making, Not for me giving or taking; I love my Love and he loves not me, I love my Love and my heart is breaking. Sweet is Spring in its lovely showing, Sweet the violet veiled in blowing, Sweet it is to love and be loved; Ah, sweet knowledge beyond my knowing! Who sighs for love sighs but for pleasure, Who wastes for love hoards up a treasure; Sweet to be loved and take no count, Sweet it is to love without measure. Sweet my Love whom I loved to try for, Sweet my Love whom I love and sigh for, Will you once love me and sigh for me, You my Love whom I love and die for? MEMENTO MORI. Poor the pleasure Doled out by measure, Sweet tho' it be, while brief As falling of the leaf; Poor is pleasure By weight and measure. Sweet the sorrow Which ends tomorrow; Sharp tho' it be and sore, It ends for evermore: Zest of sorrow, What ends tomorrow. “ONE FOOT ON SEA, AND ONE ON SHORE.” “Oh tell me once and tell me twice And tell me thrice to make it plain, When we who part this weary day, When we who part shall meet again.” “When windflowers blossom on the sea And fishes skim along the plain, Then we who part this weary day, Then you and I shall meet again.” “Yet tell me once before we part, Why need we part who part in pain? If flowers must blossom on the sea, Why, we shall never meet again. “My cheeks are paler than a rose, My tears are salter than the main, My heart is like a lump of ice If we must never meet again.” “Oh weep or laugh, but let me be, And live or die, for all's in vain; For life's in vain since we must part, And parting must not meet again “Till windflowers blossom on the sea And fishes skim along the plain; Pale rose of roses let me be, Your breaking heart breaks mine again.” BUDS AND BABIES. A million buds are born that never blow, That sweet with promise lift a pretty head To blush and wither on a barren bed And leave no fruit to show. Sweet, unfulfilled. Yet have I understood One joy, by their fragility made plain: Nothing was ever beautiful in vain, Or all in vain was good. BOY JOHNNY. “If you'll busk you as a bride And make ready, It's I will wed you with a ring, O fair lady.” “Shall I busk me as a bride, I so bonny, For you to wed me with a ring, O boy Johnny?” “When you've busked you as a bride And made ready, Who else is there to marry you, O fair lady?” “I will find my lover out, I so bonny, And you shall bear my wedding-train, O boy Johnny.” FREAKS OF FASHION. Such a hubbub in the nests, Such a bustle and squeak! Nestlings, guiltless of a feather, Learning just to speak, Ask—“And how about the fashions?” From a cavernous beak. Perched on bushes, perched on hedges, Perched on firm hahas, Perched on anything that holds them, Gay papas and grave mammas Teach the knowledge-thirsty nestlings: Hear the gay papas. Robin says: “A scarlet waistcoat Will be all the wear, Snug, and also cheerful-looking For the frostiest air, Comfortable for the chest too When one comes to plume and pair.” “Neat gray hoods will be in vogue,” Quoth a Jackdaw: “Glossy gray, Setting close, yet setting easy, Nothing fly-away; Suited to our misty mornings, À la negligée.” Flushing salmon, flushing sulphur, Haughty Cockatoos Answer—“Hoods may do for mornings, But for evenings choose High head-dresses, curved like crescents, Such as well-bred persons use.” “Top-knots, yes; yet more essential Still, a train or tail,” Screamed the Peacock: “Gemmed and lustrous, Not too stiff, and not too frail; Those are best which rearrange as Fans, and spread or trail.” Spoke the Swan, entrenched behind An inimitable neck: “After all, there's nothing sweeter For the lawn or lake Than simple white, if fine and flaky And absolutely free from speck.” “Yellow,” hinted a Canary, “Warmer, not less distingué.” “Peach colour,” put in a Lory, “Cannot look outré.” “All the colours are in fashion, And are right,” the Parrots say. “Very well. But do contrast Tints harmonious,” Piped a Blackbird, justly proud Of bill aurigerous; “Half the world may learn a lesson As to that from us.” Then a Stork took up the word: “Aim at height and chic: Not high heels, they're common; somehow, Stilted legs, not thick, Nor yet thin:” he just glanced downward And snapped to his beak. Here a rustling and a whirring, As of fans outspread, Hinted that mammas felt anxious Lest the next thing said Might prove less than quite judicious, Or even underbred. So a mother Auk resumed The broken thread of speech: “Let colours sort themselves, my dears, Yellow, or red, or peach; The main points, as it seems to me, We mothers have to teach, “Are form and texture, elegance, An air reserved, sublime; The mode of wearing what we wear With due regard to month and clime. But now, let's all compose ourselves, It's almost breakfast-time.” A hubbub, a squeak, a bustle! Who cares to chatter or sing With delightful breakfast coming? Yet they whisper under the wing: “So we may wear whatever we like, Anything, everything!” AN OCTOBER GARDEN. In my Autumn garden I was fain To mourn among my scattered roses; Alas for that last rosebud which uncloses To Autumn's languid sun and rain When all the world is on the wane! Which has not felt the sweet constraint of June, Nor heard the nightingale in tune. Broad-faced asters by my garden walk, You are but coarse compared with roses: More choice, more dear that rosebud which uncloses Faint-scented, pinched, upon its stalk, That least and last which cold winds balk; A rose it is tho' least and last of all, A rose to me tho' at the fall. “SUMMER IS ENDED.” To think that this meaningless thing was ever a rose, Scentless, colourless, this! Will it ever be thus (who knows?) Thus with our bliss, If we wait till the close? Tho' we care not to wait for the end, there comes the end Sooner, later, at last, Which nothing can mar, nothing mend: An end locked fast, Bent we cannot re-bend. PASSING AND GLASSING. All things that pass Are woman's looking-glass; They show her how her bloom must fade, And she herself be laid With withered roses in the shade; With withered roses and the fallen peach, Unlovely, out of reach Of summer joy that was. All things that pass Are woman's tiring-glass; The faded lavender is sweet, Sweet the dead violet Culled and laid by and cared for yet; The dried-up violets and dried lavender Still sweet, may comfort her, Nor need she cry Alas! All things that pass Are wisdom's looking-glass; Being full of hope and fear, and still Brimful of good or ill, According to our work and will; For there is nothing new beneath the sun; Our doings have been done, And that which shall be was. “I WILL ARISE.” Weary and weak,—accept my weariness; Weary and weak and downcast in my soul, With hope growing less and less, And with the goal Distant and dim,—accept my sore distress. I thought to reach the goal so long ago, At outset of the race I dreamed of rest, Not knowing what now I know Of breathless haste, Of long-drawn straining effort across the waste. One only thing I knew, Thy love of me; One only thing I know, Thy sacred same Love of me full and free, A craving flame Of selfless love of me which burns in Thee. How can I think of Thee, and yet grow chill; Of Thee, and yet grow cold and nigh to death? Re-energize my will, Rebuild my faith; I will arise and run, Thou giving me breath. I will arise, repenting and in pain; I will arise, and smite upon my breast And turn to Thee again; Thou choosest best, Lead me along the road Thou makest plain. Lead me a little way, and carry me A little way, and hearken to my sighs, And store my tears with Thee, And deign replies To feeble prayers;—O Lord, I will arise. A PRODIGAL SON. Does that lamp still burn in my Father's house, Which he kindled the night I went away? I turned once beneath the cedar boughs, And marked it gleam with a golden ray; Did he think to light me home some day? Hungry here with the crunching swine, Hungry harvest have I to reap; In a dream I count my Father's kine, I hear the tinkling bells of his sheep, I watch his lambs that browse and leap. There is plenty of bread at home, His servants have bread enough and to spare; The purple wine-fat froths with foam, Oil and spices make sweet the air, While I perish hungry and bare. Rich and blessed those servants, rather Than I who see not my Father's face! I will arise and go to my Father:— “Fallen from sonship, beggared of grace, Grant me, Father, a servant's place.” SOEUR LOUISE DE LA MISÉRICORDE. (1674.) I have desired, and I have been desired; But now the days are over of desire, Now dust and dying embers mock my fire; Where is the hire for which my life was hired? Oh vanity of vanities, desire! Longing and love, pangs of a perished pleasure, Longing and love, a disenkindled fire, And memory a bottomless gulf of mire, And love a fount of tears outrunning measure; Oh vanity of vanities, desire! Now from my heart, love's deathbed, trickles, trickles, Drop by drop slowly, drop by drop of fire, The dross of life, of love, of spent desire; Alas, my rose of life gone all to prickles,— Oh vanity of vanities, desire! Oh vanity of vanities, desire; Stunting my hope which might have strained up higher, Turning my garden plot to barren mire; Oh death-struck love, oh disenkindled fire, Oh vanity of vanities, desire! AN “IMMURATA” SISTER. Life flows down to death; we cannot bind That current that it should not flee: Life flows down to death, as rivers find The inevitable sea. Men work and think, but women feel; And so (for I'm a woman, I) And so I should be glad to die And cease from impotence of zeal, And cease from hope, and cease from dread, And cease from yearnings without gain, And cease from all this world of pain, And be at peace among the dead. Hearts that die, by death renew their youth, Lightened of this life that doubts and dies; Silent and contented, while the Truth Unveiled makes them wise. Why should I seek and never find That something which I have not had? Fair and unutterably sad The world hath sought time out of mind; The world hath sought and I have sought,— Ah, empty world and empty I! For we have spent our strength for nought, And soon it will be time to die. Sparks fly upward toward their fount of fire, Kindling, flashing, hovering:— Kindle, flash, my soul; mount higher and higher, Thou whole burnt-offering! “IF THOU SAYEST, BEHOLD, WE KNEW IT NOT.” —Proverbs xxiv. 11, 12. 1 I have done I know not what,—what have I done? My brother's blood, my brother's soul, doth cry: And I find no defence, find no reply, No courage more to run this race I run Not knowing what I have done, have left undone; Ah me, these awful unknown hours that fly Fruitless it may be, fleeting fruitless by Rank with death-savour underneath the sun. For what avails it that I did not know The deed I did? what profits me the plea That had I known I had not wronged him so? Lord Jesus Christ, my God, him pity Thou; Lord, if it may be, pity also me: In judgment pity, and in death, and now. 2 Thou Who hast borne all burdens, bear our load, Bear Thou our load whatever load it be; Our guilt, our shame, our helpless misery, Bear Thou Who only canst, O God my God. Seek us and find us, for we cannot Thee Or seek or find or hold or cleave unto: We cannot do or undo; Lord, undo Our self-undoing, for Thine is the key Of all we are not tho' we might have been. Dear Lord, if ever mercy moved Thy mind, If so be love of us can move Thee yet, If still the nail-prints in Thy Hands are seen, Remember us,—yea, how shouldst Thou forget? Remember us for good, and seek, and find. 3 Each soul I might have succoured, may have slain, All souls shall face me at the last Appeal, That great last moment poised for woe or weal, That final moment for man's bliss or bane. Vanity of vanities, yea all is vain Which then will not avail or help or heal: Disfeatured faces, worn-out knees that kneel, Will more avail than strength or beauty then. Lord, by Thy Passion,—when Thy Face was marred In sight of earth and hell tumultuous, And Thy heart failed in Thee like melting wax, And Thy Blood dropped more precious than the nard,— Lord, for Thy sake, not our's, supply our lacks, For Thine own sake, not our's, Christ, pity us. THE THREAD OF LIFE. 1 The irresponsive silence of the land, The irresponsive sounding of the sea, Speak both one message of one sense to me:— Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band Of inner solitude; we bind not thee; But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free? What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?— And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek, And sometimes I remember days of old When fellowship seemed not so far to seek And all the world and I seemed much less cold, And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold, And hope felt strong and life itself not weak. 2 Thus am I mine own prison. Everything Around me free and sunny and at ease: Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing And where all winds make various murmuring; Where bees are found, with honey for the bees; Where sounds are music, and where silences Are music of an unlike fashioning. Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew, And smile a moment and a moment sigh Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you? But soon I put the foolish fancy by: I am not what I have nor what I do; But what I was I am, I am even I. 3 Therefore myself is that one only thing I hold to use or waste, to keep or give; My sole possession every day I live, And still mine own despite Time's winnowing. Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative; Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve; And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing. And this myself as king unto my King I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me; Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing A sweet new song of His redeemed set free; He bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting? And sing: O grave, where is thy victory? AN OLD-WORLD THICKET. ? “Una selva oscura.” Dante. Awake or sleeping (for I know not which) I was or was not mazed within a wood Where every mother-bird brought up her brood Safe in some leafy niche Of oak or ash, of cypress or of beech, Of silvery aspen trembling delicately, Of plane or warmer-tinted sycomore, Of elm that dies in secret from the core, Of ivy weak and free, Of pines, of all green lofty things that be. Such birds they seemed as challenged each desire; Like spots of azure heaven upon the wing, Like downy emeralds that alight and sing, Like actual coals on fire, Like anything they seemed, and everything. Such mirth they made, such warblings and such chat With tongue of music in a well-tuned beak, They seemed to speak more wisdom than we speak, To make our music flat And all our subtlest reasonings wild or weak. Their meat was nought but flowers like butterflies, With berries coral-coloured or like gold; Their drink was only dew, which blossoms hold Deep where the honey lies; Their wings and tails were lit by sparkling eyes. The shade wherein they revelled was a shade That danced and twinkled to the unseen sun; Branches and leaves cast shadows one by one, And all their shadows swayed In breaths of air that rustled and that played. A sound of waters neither rose nor sank, And spread a sense of freshness through the air; It seemed not here or there, but everywhere, As if the whole earth drank, Root fathom deep and strawberry on its bank. But I who saw such things as I have said, Was overdone with utter weariness; And walked in care, as one whom fears oppress Because above his head Death hangs, or damage, or the dearth of bread. Each sore defeat of my defeated life Faced and outfaced me in that bitter hour; And turned to yearning palsy all my power, And all my peace to strife, Self stabbing self with keen lack-pity knife. Sweetness of beauty moved me to despair, Stung me to anger by its mere content, Made me all lonely on that way I went, Piled care upon my care, Brimmed full my cup, and stripped me empty and bare: For all that was but showed what all was not, But gave clear proof of what might never be; Making more destitute my poverty, And yet more blank my lot, And me much sadder by its jubilee. Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk? And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear? Alas, I had no shutter to mine ear, And could not shun the talk Of all rejoicing creatures far or near. Without my will I hearkened and I heard (Asleep or waking, for I know not which), Till note by note the music changed its pitch; Bird ceased to answer bird, And every wind sighed softly if it stirred. The drip of widening waters seemed to weep, All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang, Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap Sheer down a headlong steep; High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang. Such universal sound of lamentation I heard and felt, fain not to feel or hear; Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near; Nought else but all creation Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear, Shuddering in the misery of its doom: My heart then rose a rebel against light, Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height, Ingathering wrath and gloom, Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night. Ah me, the bitterness of such revolt, All impotent, all hateful, and all hate, That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt Of an imprisoning fate, And vainly shakes, and cannot shake the gate. Agony to agony, deep called to deep, Out of the deep I called of my desire; My strength was weakness and my heart was fire; Mine eyes that would not weep Or sleep, scaled height and depth, and could not sleep; The eyes, I mean, of my rebellious soul, For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark: A random thing I seemed without a mark, Racing without a goal, Adrift upon life's sea without an ark. More leaden than the actual self of lead Outer and inner darkness weighed on me. The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free Surged full above my head The moaning tide of helpless misery. Why should I breathe, whose breath was but a sigh? Why should I live, who drew such painful breath? Oh weary work, the unanswerable why!— Yet I, why should I die, Who had no hope in life, no hope in death? Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term; But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm— Haply, there gnaws a grief— Both, haply always; not, as now, so brief. The pleasure I remember, it is past; The pain I feel, is passing passing by; Thus all the world is passing, and thus I: All things that cannot last Have grown familiar, and are born to die. And being familiar, have so long been borne That habit trains us not to break but bend: Mourning grows natural to us who mourn In foresight of an end, But that which ends not who shall brave or mend? Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough, They cling and linger trembling till they drop: I, trembling, cling to dying life; for how Face the perpetual Now? Birthless and deathless, void of start or stop, Void of repentance, void of hope and fear, Of possibility, alternative, Of all that ever made us bear to live From night to morning here, Of promise even which has no gift to give. The wood, and every creature of the wood, Seemed mourning with me in an undertone; Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan, Trees rustling where they stood And shivered, showed compassion for my mood. Rage to despair; and now despair had turned Back to self-pity and mere weariness, With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned, And might grow more or less, And might die out or wax to white excess. Without, within me, music seemed to be; Something not music, yet most musical, Silence and sound in heavenly harmony; At length a pattering fall Of feet, a bell, and bleatings, broke through all. Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow From golden sunset and from ruddy sky; The sun had stooped to earth though once so high; Had stooped to earth, in slow Warm dying loveliness brought near and low. Each water drop made answer to the light, Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face; Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space And crept from height to height, From height to loftier height crept up apace. While opposite the sun a gazing moon Put on his glory for her coronet, Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon, As his great splendour set; One only star made up her train as yet. Each twig was tipped with gold, each leaf was edged And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west; Each mother-bird, and mate-bird, and unfledged Nestling, and curious nest, Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast. And filing peacefully between the trees, Having the moon behind them, and the sun Full in their meek mild faces, walked at ease A homeward flock, at peace With one another and with every one. A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep Hung back a moment, or one lamb would leap And frolic in a dell; Yet still they kept together, journeying well, And bleating, one or other, many or few, Journeying together toward the sunlit west; Mild face by face, and woolly breast by breast, Patient, sun-brightened too, Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest. “ALL THY WORKS PRAISE THEE, O LORD.” A PROCESSIONAL OF CREATION. ALL. I all-creation sing my song of praise To God Who made me and vouchsafes my days, And sends me forth by multitudinous ways. SERAPH.

No thing is far or near; and therefore we Float neither far nor near; but where we be Weave dances round the Throne perpetually. COMETS AND METEORS. Our lights dart here and there, whirl to and fro, We flash and vanish, we die down and glow; All doing His Will Who bids us do it so. SHOWERS. We give ourselves; and be we great or small, Thus are we made like Him Who giveth all, Like Him Whose gracious pleasure bids us fall. DEWS.

We darken sun and moon, and blot the day, The good Will of our Maker to obey: Till to the glory of God we pass away. NIGHT. Moon and all stars I don for diadem To make me fair: I cast myself and them Before His feet, Who knows us gem from gem. DAY. I shout before Him in my plentitude Of light and warmth, of hope and wealth and food; Ascribing all good to the Only Good. LIGHT AND DARKNESS. I am God's dwelling-place,— And also I Make His pavilion,— Lo, we bide and fly Exulting in the Will of God Most High. LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. We indivisible flash forth His Fame, We thunder forth the glory of His Name, In harmony of resonance and flame. CLOUDS. Sweet is our store, exhaled from sea or river: We wear a rainbow, praising God the Giver Because His mercy is for ever and ever. EARTH. I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so And so rejoicing, in that I am low; Yet known of Him, and following on to know. MOUNTAINS. Our heights which laud Him, sink abased before Him higher than the highest evermore: God higher than the highest we adore. HILLS. We green-tops praise Him, and we fruitful heads, Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds: We green-tops praise Him, rising from our beds. GREEN THINGS. We all green things, we blossoms bright or dim, Trees, bushes, brushwood, corn and grasses slim, We lift our many-favoured lauds to Him. ROSE,—LILY,—VIOLET. I praise Him on my thorn which I adorn,— And I, amid my world of thistle and thorn,— And I, within my veil where I am born. APPLE,—CITRON,—POMEGRANATE. We Apple-blossom, Citron, Pomegranate, We clothed of God without our toil and fret, We offer fatness where His Throne is set. VINE,—CEDAR,—PALM. I proffer Him my sweetness, who am sweet,— I bow my strength in fragrance at His feet,— I wave myself before His Judgment Seat. MEDICINAL HERBS. I bring refreshment,— I bring ease and calm,— I lavish strength and healing,— I am balm,— We work His pitiful Will and chant our psalm. A SPRING. Clear my pure fountain, clear and pure my rill, My fountain and mine outflow deep and still, I set His semblance forth and do His Will. SEA. Today I praise God with a sparkling face, My thousand thousand waves all uttering praise: Tomorrow I commit me to His Grace. FLOODS. We spring and swell meandering to and fro, From height to depth, from depth to depth we flow, We fertilize the world, and praise Him so. WHALES AND SEA MAMMALS. We Whales and Monsters gambol in His sight Rejoicing every day and every night, Safe in the tender keeping of His Might. FISHES. Our fashions and our colours and our speeds Set forth His praise Who framed us and Who feeds, Who knows our number and regards our needs. BIRDS. Winged Angels of this visible world, we fly To sing God's praises in the lofty sky; We scale the height to praise our Lord most High. EAGLE AND DOVE.

I praise the Lion of the Royal Race, Strongest in fight and swiftest in the chase: With all my might I leap and lavish praise. ALL MEN. All creatures sing around us, and we sing: We bring our own selves as our offering, Our very selves we render to our King. ISRAEL. Flock of our Shepherd's pasture and His fold, Purchased and well-beloved from days of old, We tell His praise which still remains untold. PRIESTS. We free-will Shepherds tend His sheep and feed; We follow Him while caring for their need; We follow praising Him, and them we lead. SERVANTS OF GOD. We love God, for He loves us; we are free In serving Him, who serve Him willingly: As kings we reign, and praise His Majesty. HOLY AND HUMBLE PERSONS. All humble souls He calls and sanctifies; All holy souls He calls to make them wise; Accepting all, His free-will sacrifice. BABES. He maketh me,— And me,— And me,— To be His blessed little ones around His knee, Who praise Him by mere love confidingly. WOMEN. God makes our service love, and makes our wage Love: so we wend on patient pilgrimage, Extolling Him by love from age to age. MEN. God gives us power to rule: He gives us power To rule ourselves, and prune the exuberant flower Of youth, and worship Him hour after hour. SPIRITS AND SOULS— Lo, in the hidden world we chant our chant To Him Who fills us that we nothing want, To Him Whose bounty leaves our craving scant. OF BABES— With milky mouths we praise God, from the breast Called home betimes to rest the perfect rest, By love and joy fulfilling His behest. OF WOMEN— We praise His Will which made us what He would, His Will which fashioned us and called us good, His Will our plenary beatitude. OF MEN. We praise His Will Who bore with us so long, Who out of weakness wrought us swift and strong, Champions of right and putters-down of wrong. ALL. Let everything that hath or hath not breath, Let days and endless days, let life and death, Praise God, praise God, praise God, His creature saith. LATER LIFE: A DOUBLE SONNET OF SONNETS. 1. Before the mountains were brought forth, before Earth and the world were made, then God was God: And God will still be God, when flames shall roar Round earth and heaven dissolving at His nod: And this God is our God, even while His rod Of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore: And this God is our God for evermore Thro' life, thro' death, while clod returns to clod. For tho' He slay us we will trust in Him; We will flock home to Him by divers ways: Yea, tho' He slay us we will vaunt His praise, Serving and loving with the Cherubim, Watching and loving with the Seraphim, Our very selves His praise thro' endless days. 2. Rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins; Gird sackcloth not on body but on soul; Grovel in dust with faces toward the goal Nor won, nor neared: he only laughs who wins. Not neared the goal, the race too late begins; All left undone, we have yet to do the whole; The sun is hurrying west and toward the pole Where darkness waits for earth with all her kins. Let us today while it is called today Set out, if utmost speed may yet avail— The shadows lengthen and the light grows pale: For who thro' darkness and the shadow of death, Darkness that may be felt, shall find a way, Blind-eyed, deaf-eared, and choked with failing breath? 3. Thou Who didst make and knowest whereof we are made, Oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness, Our wordless tearless dumbness of distress: Bear Thou in mind the burden Thou hast laid Upon us, and our feebleness unstayed Except Thou stay us: for the long long race Which stretches far and far before our face Thou knowest,—remember Thou whereof we are made. If making makes us Thine then Thine we are, And if redemption we are twice Thine own: If once Thou didst come down from heaven afar To seek us and to find us, how not save? Comfort us, save us, leave us not alone, Thou Who didst die our death and fill our grave. 4. So tired am I, so weary of today, So unrefreshed from foregone weariness, So overburdened by foreseen distress, So lagging and so stumbling on my way, I scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray, To hope, or aim, or toil for more or less,— Ah, always less and less, even while I press Forward and toil and aim as best I may. Half-starved of soul and heartsick utterly, Yet lift I up my heart and soul and eyes (Which fail in looking upward) toward the prize: Me, Lord, Thou seest tho' I see not Thee; Me now, as once the Thief in Paradise, Even me, O Lord my Lord, remember me. 5. Lord, Thou Thyself art Love and only Thou; Yet I who am not love would fain love Thee; But Thou alone being Love canst furnish me With that same love my heart is craving now. Allow my plea! for if Thou disallow, No second fountain can I find but Thee; No second hope or help is left to me, No second anything, but only Thou. O Love accept, according my request; O Love exhaust, fulfilling my desire: Uphold me with the strength that cannot tire, Nerve me to labour till Thou bid me rest, Kindle my fire from Thine unkindled fire, And charm the willing heart from out my breast. 6. We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack: Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly. We see the things we do not yearn to see Around us: and what see we glancing back? Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack, Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be, For which we steered on life's salt stormy sea Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack. If thus to look behind is all in vain, And all in vain to look to left or right, Why face we not our future once again, Launching with hardier hearts across the main, Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight, And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain? 7. To love and to remember; that is good: To love and to forget; that is not well: To lapse from love to hatred; that is hell And death and torment, rightly understood. Soul dazed by love and sorrow, cheer thy mood; More blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell: Ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell, And salt with hope thy life's insipid food. Love is the goal, love is the way we wend, Love is our parallel unending line Whose only perfect Parallel is Christ, Beginning not begun, End without end: For He Who hath the Heart of God sufficed, Can satisfy all hearts,—yea, thine and mine. 8. We feel and see with different hearts and eyes:— Ah Christ, if all our hearts could meet in Thee How well it were for them and well for me, Our hearts Thy dear accepted sacrifice. Thou, only Life of hearts and Light of eyes, Our life, our light, if once we turn to Thee, So be it, O Lord, to them and so to me; Be all alike Thine own dear sacrifice. Thou Who by death hast ransomed us from death, Thyself God's sole well-pleasing Sacrifice, Thine only sacred Self I plead with Thee: Make Thou it well for them and well for me That Thou hast given us souls and wills and breath, And hearts to love Thee, and to see Thee eyes. 9. Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar Beyond the drawings each of other's strength: One blazes thro' the brief bright summer's length Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car; While one unchangeable upon a throne Broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone, Content to reign the bright particular star Of some who wander or of some who groan. They own no drawings each of other's strength, Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy, Nor veer along their courses each toward each: Yet are their orbits pitched in harmony Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length Mayhap they talk together without speech. 10. Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground. It may be, could we look with seeing eyes, This spot we stand on is a Paradise Where dead have come to life and lost been found, Where Faith has triumphed, Martyrdom been crowned, Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise; From this same spot the dust of saints may rise, And the King's prisoners come to light unbound. O earth, earth, earth, hear thou thy Maker's Word: “Thy dead thou shalt give up, nor hide thy slain”— Some who went weeping forth shall come again Rejoicing from the east or from the west, As doves fly to their windows, love's own bird Contented and desirous to the nest. “Quali colombe dal disio chiamate Con l'ali aperte e ferme al dolce nido Volan per l'aer dal voler portate.” Dante. 11. Lifelong our stumbles, lifelong our regret, Lifelong our efforts failing and renewed, While lifelong is our witness, “God is good:” Who bore with us till now, bears with us yet, Who still remembers and will not forget, Who gives us light and warmth and daily food; And gracious promises half understood, And glories half unveiled, whereon to set Our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire; Uplifting us to longing and to love, Luring us upward from this world of mire, Urging us to press on and mount above Ourselves and all we have had experience of, Mounting to Him in love's perpetual fire. 12. A dream there is wherein we are fain to scream, While struggling with ourselves we cannot speak: And much of all our waking life, as weak And misconceived, eludes us like the dream. For half life's seemings are not what they seem, And vain the laughs we laugh, the shrieks we shriek; Yea, all is vain that mars the settled meek Contented quiet of our daily theme. When I was young I deemed that sweets are sweet: But now I deem some searching bitters are Sweeter than sweets, and more refreshing far, And to be relished more, and more desired, And more to be pursued on eager feet, On feet untired, and still on feet tho' tired. 13. Shame is a shadow cast by sin: yet shame Itself may be a glory and a grace, Refashioning the sin-disfashioned face; A nobler bruit than hollow-sounded fame, A new-lit lustre on a tarnished name, One virtue pent within an evil place, Strength for the fight, and swiftness for the race, A stinging salve, a life-requickening flame. A salve so searching we may scarcely live, A flame so fierce it seems that we must die, An actual cautery thrust into the heart: Nevertheless, men die not of such smart; And shame gives back what nothing else can give, Man to himself,—then sets him up on high. 14. When Adam and when Eve left Paradise Did they love on and cling together still, Forgiving one another all that ill The twain had wrought on such a different wise? She propped upon his strength, and he in guise Of lover tho' of lord, girt to fulfil Their term of life and die when God should will; Lie down and sleep, and having slept arise. Boast not against us, O our enemy! Today we fall, but we shall rise again; We grope today, tomorrow we shall see: What is today that we should fear today? A morrow cometh which shall sweep away Thee and thy realm of change and death and pain. 15. Let woman fear to teach and bear to learn, Remembering the first woman's first mistake. Eve had for pupil the inquiring snake, Whose doubts she answered on a great concern; But he the tables so contrived to turn, It next was his to give and her's to take; Till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake, And fired a train by which the world must burn. Did Adam love his Eve from first to last? I think so; as we love who works us ill, And wounds us to the quick, yet loves us still. Love pardons the unpardonable past: Love in a dominant embrace holds fast His frailer self, and saves without her will. 16. Our teachers teach that one and one make two: Later, Love rules that one and one make one: Abstruse the problems! neither need we shun, But skilfully to each should yield its due. The narrower total seems to suit the few, The wider total suits the common run; Each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun; Both provable by me, and both by you. Befogged and witless, in a wordy maze A groping stroll perhaps may do us good; If cloyed we are with much we have understood, If tired of half our dusty world and ways, If sick of fasting, and if sick of food;— And how about these long still-lengthening days? 17. Something this foggy day, a something which Is neither of this fog nor of today, Has set me dreaming of the winds that play Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach, And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray: Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away, So out of reach while quite within my reach, As out of reach as India or Cathay! I am sick of where I am and where I am not, I am sick of foresight and of memory, I am sick of all I have and all I see, I am sick of self, and there is nothing new; Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!— Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you? 18. So late in Autumn half the world's asleep, And half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale; For dampness now, not freshness, rides the gale; And cold and colourless comes ashore the deep With tides that bluster or with tides that creep; Now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil Of fog, not sultry haze; and blight and bale Have done their worst, and leaves rot on the heap. So late in Autumn one forgets the Spring, Forgets the Summer with its opulence, The callow birds that long have found a wing, The swallows that more lately gat them hence: Will anything like Spring, will anything Like Summer, rouse one day the slumbering sense? 19. Here now is Winter. Winter, after all, Is not so drear as was my boding dream While Autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam On sapless leafage too inert to fall. Still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall Where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam; Still here a bud and there a blossom seem Hopeful, and robin still is musical. Leaves, flowers and fruit and one delightful song Remain; these days are short, but now the nights Intense and long, hang out their utmost lights; Such starry nights are long, yet not too long; Frost nips the weak, while strengthening still the strong Against that day when Spring sets all to rights. 20. A hundred thousand birds salute the day:— One solitary bird salutes the night: Its mellow grieving wiles our grief away, And tunes our weary watches to delight; It seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say, To know and sing them, and to set them right; Until we feel once more that May is May, And hope some buds may bloom without a blight. This solitary bird outweighs, outvies, The hundred thousand merry-making birds Whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise Would we but follow when they bid us rise, Would we but set their notes of praise to words And launch our hearts up with them to the skies. 21. A host of things I take on trust: I take The nightingales on trust, for few and far Between those actual summer moments are When I have heard what melody they make. So chanced it once at Como on the Lake: But all things, then, waxed musical; each star Sang on its course, each breeze sang on its car, All harmonies sang to senses wide awake. All things in tune, myself not out of tune, Those nightingales were nightingales indeed: Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need, And wrought a rapture underneath that moon, Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed; For June that night glowed like a doubled June. 22. The mountains in their overwhelming might Moved me to sadness when I saw them first, And afterwards they moved me to delight; Struck harmonies from silent chords which burst Out into song, a song by memory nursed; For ever unrenewed by touch or sight Sleeps the keen magic of each day or night, In pleasure and in wonder then immersed. All Switzerland behind us on the ascent, All Italy before us we plunged down St. Gothard, garden of forget-me-not: Yet why should such a flower choose such a spot? Could we forget that way which once we went Tho' not one flower had bloomed to weave its crown? 23. Beyond the seas we know, stretch seas unknown Blue and bright-coloured for our dim and green; Beyond the lands we see, stretch lands unseen With many-tinted tangle overgrown; And icebound seas there are like seas of stone, Serenely stormless as death lies serene; And lifeless tracts of sand, which intervene Betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown. This dead and living world befits our case Who live and die: we live in wearied hope, We die in hope not dead; we run a race Today, and find no present halting-place; All things we see lie far within our scope, And still we peer beyond with craving face. 24. The wise do send their hearts before them to Dear blessed Heaven, despite the veil between; The foolish nurse their hearts within the screen Of this familiar world, where all we do Or have is old, for there is nothing new: Yet elder far that world we have not seen; God's Presence antedates what else hath been: Many the foolish seem, the wise seem few. Oh foolishest fond folly of a heart Divided, neither here nor there at rest! That hankers after Heaven, but clings to earth; That neither here nor there knows thorough mirth, Half-choosing, wholly missing, the good part:— Oh fool among the foolish, in thy quest. 25. When we consider what this life we lead Is not, and is: how full of toil and pain, How blank of rest and of substantial gain, Beset by hunger earth can never feed, And propping half our hearts upon a reed; We cease to mourn lost treasures, mourned in vain, Lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain To fetch back for a solace of our need. For who that feel this burden and this strain, This wide vacuity of hope and heart, Would bring their cherished well-beloved again: To bleed with them and wince beneath the smart, To have with stinted bliss such lavish bane, To hold in lieu of all so poor a part? 26. This Life is full of numbness and of balk, Of haltingness and baffled short-coming, Of promise unfulfilled, of everything That is puffed vanity and empty talk: Its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk, Its very song-bird trails a broken wing, Its very Spring is not indeed like Spring, But sighs like Autumn round an aimless walk. This Life we live is dead for all its breath; Death's self it is, set off on pilgrimage, Travelling with tottering steps the first short stage: The second stage is one mere desert dust Where Death sits veiled amid creation's rust:— Unveil thy face, O Death who art not Death. 27. I have dreamed of Death:—what will it be to die Not in a dream, but in the literal truth With all Death's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth, The pang that is the last and the last sigh? Too dulled, it may be, for a last good-bye, Too comfortless for any one to soothe, A helpless charmless spectacle of ruth Thro' long last hours, so long while yet they fly. So long to those who hopeless in their fear Watch the slow breath and look for what they dread: While I supine with ears that cease to hear, With eyes that glaze, with heart pulse running down (Alas! no saint rejoicing on her bed), May miss the goal at last, may miss a crown. 28. In life our absent friend is far away: But death may bring our friend exceeding near, Show him familiar faces long so dear And lead him back in reach of words we say. He only cannot utter yea or nay In any voice accustomed to our ear; He only cannot make his face appear And turn the sun back on our shadowed day. The dead may be around us, dear and dead; The unforgotten dearest dead may be Watching us with unslumbering eyes and heart; Brimful of words which cannot yet be said, Brimful of knowledge they may not impart, Brimful of love for you and love for me. “FOR THINE OWN SAKE, O MY GOD.” Wearied of sinning, wearied of repentance, Wearied of self, I turn, my God, to Thee; To Thee, my Judge, on Whose all-righteous sentence Hangs mine eternity: I turn to Thee, I plead Thyself with Thee,— Be pitiful to me. Wearied I loathe myself, I loathe my sinning, My stains, my festering sores, my misery: Thou the Beginning, Thou ere my beginning Didst see and didst foresee Me miserable, me sinful, ruined me,— I plead Thyself with Thee. I plead Thyself with Thee Who art my Maker, Regard Thy handiwork that cries to Thee; I plead Thyself with Thee Who wast partaker Of mine infirmity, Love made Thee what Thou art, the love of me,— I plead Thyself with Thee. UNTIL THE DAY BREAK. When will the day bring its pleasure? When will the night bring its rest? Reaper and gleaner and thresher Peer toward the east and the west:— The Sower He knoweth, and He knoweth best. Meteors flash forth and expire, Northern lights kindle and pale; These are the days of desire, Of eyes looking upward that fail; Vanishing days as a finishing tale. Bows down the crop in its glory Tenfold, fiftyfold, hundredfold; The millet is ripened and hoary, The wheat ears are ripened to gold:— Why keep us waiting in dimness and cold? The Lord of the harvest, He knoweth Who knoweth the first and the last: The Sower Who patiently soweth, He scanneth the present and past: He saith, “What thou hast, what remaineth, hold fast.” Yet, Lord, o'er Thy toil-wearied weepers The storm-clouds hang muttering and frown: On threshers and gleaners and reapers, O Lord of the harvest, look down; Oh for the harvest, the shout, and the crown! “Not so,” saith the Lord of the reapers, The Lord of the first and the last: “O My toilers, My weary, My weepers, What ye have, what remaineth, hold fast. Hide in My heart till the vengeance be past.” “OF HIM THAT WAS READY TO PERISH.” Lord, I am waiting, weeping, watching for Thee: My youth and hope lie by me buried and dead, My wandering love hath not where to lay its head Except Thou say “Come to Me.” My noon is ended, abolished from life and light, My noon is ended, ended and done away, My sun went down in the hours that still were day, And my lingering day is night. How long, O Lord, how long in my desperate pain Shall I weep and watch, shall I weep and long for Thee? Is Thy grace ended, Thy love cut off from me? How long shall I long in vain? O God Who before the beginning hast seen the end, Who hast made me flesh and blood, not frost and not fire, Who hast filled me full of needs and love and desire And a heart that craves a friend, Who hast said “Come to Me and I will give thee rest,” Who hast said “Take on thee My yoke and learn of Me,” Who calledst a little child to come to Thee, And pillowedst John on Thy breast; Who spak'st to women that followed Thee sorrowing, Bidding them weep for themselves and weep for their own; Who didst welcome the outlaw adoring Thee all alone, And plight Thy word as a King,— By Thy love of these and of all that ever shall be, By Thy love of these and of all the born and unborn, Turn Thy gracious eyes on me and think no scorn Of me, not even of me. Beside Thy Cross I hang on my cross in shame, My wounds, weakness, extremity cry to Thee: Bid me also to Paradise, also me For the glory of Thy Name. “BEHOLD THE MAN!” Shall Christ hang on the Cross, and we not look? Heaven, earth and hell stood gazing at the first, While Christ for long-cursed man was counted cursed; Christ, God and Man, Whom God the Father strook And shamed and sifted and one while forsook:— Cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed In sweets, our souls in pride, our spirits immersed In wilfulness, our steps run all acrook. Cry shame upon us! for He bore our shame In agony, and we look on at ease With neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame: What hast thou, what have I, to do with peace? Not to send peace but send a sword He came, And fire and fasts and tearful night-watches. THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS. Is this the Face that thrills with awe Seraphs who veil their face above? Is this the Face without a flaw, The Face that is the Face of Love? Yea, this defaced, a lifeless clod, Hath all creation's love sufficed, Hath satisfied the love of God, This Face the Face of Jesus Christ. “IT IS FINISHED.” Dear Lord, let me recount to Thee Some of the great things Thou hast done For me, even me Thy little one. It was not I that cared for Thee,— But Thou didst set Thy heart upon Me, even me Thy little one. And therefore was it sweet to Thee To leave Thy Majesty and Throne, And grow like me A Little One, A swaddled Baby on the knee Of a dear Mother of Thine own, Quite weak like me Thy little one. Thou didst assume my misery, And reap the harvest I had sown, Comforting me Thy little one. Jerusalem and Galilee,— Thy love embraced not those alone, But also me Thy little one. Thy unblemished Body on the Tree Was bared and broken to atone For me, for me Thy little one. Thou lovedst me upon the Tree,— Still me, hid by the ponderous stone,— Me always,—me Thy little one. And love of me arose with Thee When death and hell lay overthrown: Thou lovedst me Thy little one. And love of me went up with Thee To sit upon Thy Father's Throne: Thou lovest me Thy little one. Lord, as Thou me, so would I Thee Love in pure love's communion, For Thou lov'st me Thy little one: Which love of me bring back with Thee To Judgment when the Trump is blown, Still loving me Thy little one. AN EASTER CAROL. Spring bursts today, For Christ is risen and all the earth's at play. Flash forth, thou Sun, The rain is over and gone, its work is done. Winter is past, Sweet Spring is come at last, is come at last. Bud, Fig and Vine, Bud, Olive, fat with fruit and oil and wine. Break forth this morn In roses, thou but yesterday a Thorn. Uplift thy head, O pure white Lily thro' the Winter dead. Beside your dams Leap and rejoice, you merry-making Lambs. All Herds and Flocks Rejoice, all Beasts of thickets and of rocks. Sing, Creatures, sing, Angels and Men and Birds and everything, All notes of Doves Fill all our world: this is the time of loves. “BEHOLD A SHAKING.” 1 Man rising to the doom that shall not err,— Which hath most dread: the arouse of all or each; All kindreds of all nations of all speech, Or one by one of him and him and her? While dust reanimate begins to stir Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach; While every wave refashions on the beach Alive or dead-in-life some seafarer. Now meeting doth not join or parting part; True meeting and true parting wait till then, When whoso meet are joined for evermore, Face answering face and heart at rest in heart:— God bring us all rejoicing to the shore Of happy Heaven, His sheep home to the pen. 2 Blessed that flock safe penned in Paradise; Blessed this flock which tramps in weary ways; All form one flock, God's flock; all yield Him praise By joy or pain, still tending toward the prize. Joy speaks in praises there, and sings and flies Where no night is, exulting all its days; Here, pain finds solace, for, behold, it prays; In both love lives the life that never dies. Here life is the beginning of our death, And death the starting-point whence life ensues; Surely our life is death, our death is life: Nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife, But calm in faith and patience breathe the breath God gave, to take again when He shall choose. ALL SAINTS. They are flocking from the East And the West, They are flocking from the North And the South, Every moment setting forth From realm of snake or lion, Swamp or sand, Ice or burning; Greatest and least, Palm in hand And praise in mouth, They are flocking up the path To their rest, Up the path that hath No returning. Up the steeps of Zion They are mounting, Coming, coming, Throngs beyond man's counting; With a sound Like innumerable bees Swarming, humming Where flowering trees Many tinted, Many scented, All alike abound With honey,— With a swell Like a blast upswaying unrestrainable From a shadowed dell To the hill-tops sunny,— With a thunder Like the ocean when in strength Breadth and length It sets to shore; More and more Waves on waves redoubled pour Leaping flashing to the shore (Unlike the under Drain of ebb that loseth ground For all its roar). They are thronging From the East and West, From the North and South, Saints are thronging, loving, longing, To their land Of rest, Palm in hand And praise in mouth. “TAKE CARE OF HIM.” “Thou whom I love, for whom I died, Lovest thou Me, My bride?”— Low on my knees I love Thee, Lord, Believed in and adored. “That I love thee the proof is plain: How dost thou love again?”— In prayer, in toil, in earthly loss, In a long-carried cross. “Yea, thou dost love: yet one adept Brings more for Me to accept.”— I mould my will to match with Thine, My wishes I resign. “Thou givest much: then give the whole For solace of My soul.”— More would I give, if I could get: But, Lord, what lack I yet? “In Me thou lovest Me: I call Thee to love Me in all.”— Brim full my heart, dear Lord, that so My love may overflow. “Love Me in sinners and in saints, In each who needs or faints.”— Lord, I will love Thee as I can In every brother man. “All sore, all crippled, all who ache, Tend all for My dear sake.”— All for Thy sake, Lord: I will see In every sufferer Thee. “So I at last, upon My Throne Of glory, Judge alone, So I at last will say to thee: Thou diddest it to Me.” A MARTYR. The Vigil Of The Feast. Inner not outer, without gnash of teeth Or weeping, save quiet sobs of some who pray And feel the Everlasting Arms beneath,— Blackness of darkness this, but not for aye; Darkness that even in gathering fleeteth fast, Blackness of blackest darkness close to day. Lord Jesus, thro' Thy darkened pillar cast, Thy gracious eyes all-seeing cast on me Until this tyranny be overpast. Me, Lord, remember who remember Thee, And cleave to Thee, and see Thee without sight, And choose Thee still in dire extremity, And in this darkness worship Thee my Light, And Thee my Life adore in shadow of death, Thee loved by day, and still beloved by night. It is the Voice of my Beloved that saith: “I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, I go Whither that soul knows well that followeth”— O Lord, I follow, little as I know; At this eleventh hour I rise and take My life into my hand, and follow so, With tears and heart-misgivings and heart-ache; Thy feeblest follower, yet Thy follower Indomitable for Thine only sake. Tonight I gird my will afresh, and stir My strength, and brace my heart to do and dare, Marvelling: Will tomorrow wake the whirr Of the great rending wheel, or from his lair Startle the jubilant lion in his rage, Or clench the headsman's hand within my hair, Or kindle fire to speed my pilgrimage, Chariot of fire and horses of sheer fire Whirling me home to heaven by one fierce stage?— Thy Will I will, I Thy desire desire; Let not the waters close above my head, Uphold me that I sink not in this mire: For flesh and blood are frail and sore afraid; And young I am, unsatisfied and young, With memories, hopes, with cravings all unfed, My song half sung, its sweetest notes unsung, All plans cut short, all possibilities, Because my cord of life is soon unstrung. Was I a careless woman set at ease That this so bitter cup is brimmed for me? Had mine own vintage settled on the lees? A word, a puff of smoke, would set me free; A word, a puff of smoke, over and gone: . . . Howbeit, whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee? Yea, only Thee my choice is fixed upon In heaven or earth, eternity or time:— Lord, hold me fast, Lord, leave me not alone, Thy silly heartless dove that sees the lime Yet almost flutters to the tempting bough: Cover me, hide me, pluck me from this crime. A word, a puff of smoke, would save me now: . . . But who, my God, would save me in the day Of Thy fierce anger? only Saviour Thou. Preoccupy my heart, and turn away And cover up mine eyes from frantic fear, And stop mine ears lest I be driven astray: For one stands ever dinning in mine ear How my gray Father withers in the blight Of love for me, who cruel am and dear; And how my Mother thro' this lingering night Until the day, sits tearless in her woe, Loathing for love of me the happy light Which brings to pass a concourse and a show To glut the hungry faces merciless, The thousand faces swaying to and fro, Feasting on me unveiled in helplessness Alone,—yet not alone: Lord, stand by me As once by lonely Paul in his distress. As blossoms to the sun I turn to Thee; Thy dove turns to her window, think no scorn; As one dove to an ark on shoreless sea, To Thee I turn mine eyes, my heart forlorn; Put forth Thy scarred right Hand, kind Lord, take hold Of me Thine all-forsaken dove who mourn: For Thou hast loved me since the days of old, And I love Thee Whom loving I will love Thro' life's short fever-fits of heat and cold; Thy Name will I extol and sing thereof, Will flee for refuge to Thy Blessed Name. Lord, look upon me from Thy bliss above: Look down on me, who shrink from all the shame And pangs and desolation of my death, Wrenched piecemeal or devoured or set on flame, While all the world around me holds its breath With eyes glued on me for a gazing-stock, Pitiless eyes, while no man pitieth. The floods are risen, I stagger in their shock, My heart reels and is faint, I fail, I faint: My God, set Thou me up upon the rock, Thou Who didst long ago Thyself acquaint With death, our death; Thou Who didst long ago Pour forth Thy soul for sinner and for saint. Bear me in mind, whom no one else will know; Thou Whom Thy friends forsook, take Thou my part, Of all forsaken in mine overthrow; Carry me in Thy bosom, in Thy heart, Carry me out of darkness into light, Tomorrow make me see Thee as Thou art. Lover and friend Thou hidest from my sight:— Alas, alas, mine earthly love, alas, For whom I thought to don the garments white And white wreath of a bride, this rugged pass Hath utterly divorced me from thy care; Yea, I am to thee as a shattered glass Worthless, with no more beauty lodging there, Abhorred, lest I involve thee in my doom: For sweet are sunshine and this upper air, And life and youth are sweet, and give us room For all most sweetest sweetnesses we taste: Dear, what hast thou in common with a tomb? I bow my head in silence, I make haste Alone, I make haste out into the dark, My life and youth and hope all run to waste. Is this my body cold and stiff and stark, Ashes made ashes, earth becoming earth, Is this a prize for man to make his mark? Am I that very I who laughed in mirth A while ago, a little little while, Yet all the while a-dying since my birth? Now am I tired, too tired to strive or smile; I sit alone, my mouth is in the dust: Look Thou upon me, Lord, for I am vile. In Thee is all my hope, is all my trust, On Thee I centre all my self that dies, And self that dies not with its mortal crust, But sleeps and wakes, and in the end will rise With hymns and hallelujahs on its lips, Thee loving with the love that satisfies. As once in Thine unutterable eclipse The sun and moon grew dark for sympathy, And earth cowered quaking underneath the drips Of Thy slow Blood priceless exceedingly, So now a little spare me, and show forth Some pity, O my God, some pity of me. If trouble comes not from the south or north, But meted to us by Thy tender hand, Let me not in Thine eyes be nothing worth: Behold me where in agony I stand, Behold me no man caring for my soul, And take me to Thee in the far-off land, Shorten the race and lift me to the goal. WHY? Lord, if I love Thee and Thou lovest me, Why need I any more these toilsome days; Why should I not run singing up Thy ways Straight into heaven, to rest myself with Thee? What need remains of death-pang yet to be, If all my soul is quickened in Thy praise; If all my heart loves Thee, what need the amaze, Struggle and dimness of an agony?— Bride whom I love, if thou too lovest Me, Thou needs must choose My Likeness for thy dower: So wilt thou toil in patience, and abide Hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour When I My Likeness shall behold in thee, And thou therein shalt waken satisfied. “LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH.” “I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee, I have not thirsted for Thee: And now cold billows of death surround me, Buffeting billows of death astound me,— Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see Thy perishing me?” “Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee, Yea, I have thirsted for thee, Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee: Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee,— Thro' death's darkness I look and see And clasp thee to Me.” IV Poems Added in Poems (1888) BIRCHINGTON CHURCHYARD. A lowly hill which overlooks a flat, Half sea, half country side; A flat-shored sea of low-voiced creeping tide Over a chalky weedy mat. A hill of hillocks, flowery and kept green Round Crosses raised for hope, With many-tinted sunsets where the slope Faces the lingering western sheen. A lowly hope, a height that is but low, While Time sets solemnly, While the tide rises of Eternity, Silent and neither swift nor slow. ONE SEA-SIDE GRAVE. Unmindful of the roses, Unmindful of the thorn, A reaper tired reposes Among his gathered corn: So might I, till the morn! Cold as the cold Decembers, Past as the days that set, While only one remembers And all the rest forget,— But one remembers yet. BROTHER BRUIN. A dancing Bear grotesque and funny Earned for his master heaps of money, Gruff yet good-natured, fond of honey, And cheerful if the day was sunny. Past hedge and ditch, past pond and wood He tramped, and on some common stood; There cottage children circling gaily, He in their midmost footed daily. Pandean pipes and drum and muzzle Were quite enough his brain to puzzle: But like a philosophic bear He let alone extraneous care And danced contented anywhere. Still, year on year, and wear and tear, Age even the gruffest bluffest bear. A day came when he scarce could prance, And when his master looked askance On dancing Bear who would not dance. To looks succeeded blows; hard blows Battered his ears and poor old nose. From bluff and gruff he waxed curmudgeon; He danced indeed, but danced in dudgeon, Capered in fury fast and faster:— Ah, could he once but hug his master And perish in one joint disaster! But deafness, blindness, weakness growing, Not fury's self could keep him going. One dark day when the snow was snowing His cup was brimmed to overflowing: He tottered, toppled on one side, Growled once, and shook his head, and died. The master kicked and struck in vain, The weary drudge had distanced pain And never now would wince again. The master growled: he might have howled Or coaxed—that slave's last growl was growled. So gnawed by rancour and chagrin One thing remained: he sold the skin. What next the man did is not worth Your notice or my setting forth, But hearken what befell at last. His idle working days gone past, And not one friend and not one penny Stored up (if ever he had any Friends: but his coppers had been many), All doors stood shut against him, but The workhouse door which cannot shut. There he droned on—a grim old sinner Toothless and grumbling for his dinner, Unpitied quite, uncared for much (The ratepayers not favouring such), Hungry and gaunt, with time to spare: Perhaps the hungry gaunt old Bear Danced back, a haunting memory. Indeed I hope so: for you see If once the hard old heart relented The hard old man may have repented. “A HELPMEET FOR HIM.” Woman was made for man's delight; Charm, O woman, be not afraid! His shadow by day, his moon by night, Woman was made. Her strength with weakness is overlaid; Meek compliances veil her might; Him she stays, by whom she is stayed. World-wide champion of truth and right, Hope in gloom and in danger aid, Tender and faithful, ruddy and white, Woman was made. A SONG OF FLIGHT. While we slumber and sleep The sun leaps up from the deep —Daylight born at the leap!— Rapid, dominant, free, Athirst to bathe in the uttermost sea. While we linger at play —If the year would stand at May!— Winds are up and away Over land, over sea, To their goal wherever their goal may be. It is time to arise, To race for the promised prize, —The Sun flies, the Wind flies— We are strong, we are free, And home lies beyond the stars and the sea. A WINTRY SONNET. A Robin said: The Spring will never come, And I shall never care to build again. A Rosebush said: These frosts are wearisome, My sap will never stir for sun or rain. The half Moon said: These nights are fogged and slow, I neither care to wax nor care to wane. The Ocean said: I thirst from long ago, Because earth's rivers cannot fill the main.— When Springtime came, red Robin built a nest, And trilled a lover's song in sheer delight. Gray hoarfrost vanished, and the Rose with might Clothed her in leaves and buds of crimson core. The dim Moon brightened. Ocean sunned his crest, Dimpled his blue, yet thirsted evermore. RESURGAM. From depth to height, from height to loftier height, The climber sets his foot and sets his face, Tracks lingering sunbeams to their halting-place, And counts the last pulsations of the light. Strenuous thro' day and unsurprised by night He runs a race with Time and wins the race, Emptied and stripped of all save only Grace, Will, Love, a threefold panoply of might. Darkness descends for light he toiled to seek: He stumbles on the darkened mountain-head, Left breathless in the unbreathable thin air, Made freeman of the living and the dead:— He wots not he has topped the topmost peak, But the returning sun will find him there. TODAY'S BURDEN. “Arise, depart, for this is not your rest.”— Oh burden of all burdens, still to arise And still depart, nor rest in any wise! Rolling, still rolling thus to east from west Earth journeys on her immemorial quest, Whom a moon chases in no different guise: Thus stars pursue their courses, and thus flies The sun, and thus all creatures manifest. Unrest the common heritage, the ban Flung broadcast on all humankind, on all Who live; for living, all are bound to die: That which is old, we know that it is man: These have no rest who sit and dream and sigh, Nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall. “THERE IS A BUDDING MORROW IN MIDNIGHT.” Wintry boughs against a wintry sky; Yet the sky is partly blue And the clouds are partly bright:— Who can tell but sap is mounting high Out of sight, Ready to burst through? Winter is the mother-nurse of Spring, Lovely for her daughter's sake, Not unlovely for her own: For a future buds in everything; Grown, or blown, Or about to break. EXULTATE DEO. Many a flower hath perfume for its dower, And many a bird a song, And harmless lambs milkwhite beside their dams Frolic along; Perfume and song and whiteness offering praise In humble, peaceful ways. Man's high degree hath will and memory, Affection and desire, By loftier ways he mounts of prayer and praise; Fire unto fire, Deep unto deep responsive, height to height, Until he walk in white. A HOPE CAROL. A night was near, a day was near, Between a day and night I heard sweet voices calling clear, Calling me: I heard a whirr of wing on wing, But could not see the sight; I long to see my birds that sing, I long to see. Below the stars, beyond the moon, Between the night and day I heard a rising falling tune Calling me: I long to see the pipes and strings Whereon such minstrels play; I long to see each face that sings, I long to see. Today or may be not today, Tonight or not tonight, All voices that command or pray Calling me, Shall kindle in my soul such fire And in my eyes such light That I shall see that heart's desire I long to see. CHRISTMAS CAROLS. 1. Whoso hears a chiming for Christmas at the nighest, Hears a sound like Angels chanting in their glee, Hears a sound like palm boughs waving in the highest, Hears a sound like ripple of a crystal sea. Sweeter than a prayer-bell for a saint in dying, Sweeter than a death-bell for a saint at rest, Music struck in Heaven with earth's faint replying “Life is good, and death is good, for Christ is Best.” 2. A holy, heavenly chime Rings fulness in of time, And on His Mother's breast Our Lord God ever-Blest Is laid a Babe at rest. Stoop, Spirits unused to stoop, Swoop, Angels, flying swoop, Adoring as you gaze, Uplifting hymns of praise:— “Grace to the Full of Grace!” The cave is cold and strait To hold the angelic state: More strait it is, more cold, To foster and infold Its Maker one hour old. Thrilled thro' with awestruck love, Meek Angels poised above, To see their God, look down: “What, is there never a Crown For Him in swaddled gown? “How comes He soft and weak With such a tender cheek, With such a soft small hand?— The very Hand which spann'd Heaven when its girth was plann'd. “How comes He with a voice Which is but baby-noise?— That Voice which spake with might —‘Let there be light’—and light Sprang out before our sight. “What need hath He of flesh Made flawless now afresh? What need of human heart?— Heart that must bleed and smart Choosing the better part. “But see: His gracious smile Dismisses us a while To serve Him in His kin. Haste we, make haste, begin To fetch His brethren in.” Like stars they flash and shoot, The Shepherds they salute: “Glory to God” they sing: “Good news of peace we bring, For Christ is born a King.” 3. Lo! newborn Jesus Soft and weak and small, Wrapped in baby's bands By His Mother's hands, Lord God of all. Lord God of Mary, Whom His Lips caress While He rocks to rest On her milky breast In helplessness. Lord God of shepherds Flocking through the cold, Flocking through the dark To the only Ark, The only Fold. Lord God of all things Be they near or far, Be they high or low; Lord of storm and snow, Angel and star. Lord God of all men,— My Lord and my God! Thou who lovest me, Keep me close to Thee By staff and rod. Lo! newborn Jesus Loving great and small, Love's free Sacrifice, Opening Arms and Eyes To one and all. A CANDLEMAS DIALOGUE. “Love brought Me down: and cannot love make thee Carol for joy to Me? Hear cheerful robin carol from his tree, Who owes not half to Me I won for thee.” “Yea, Lord, I hear his carol's wordless voice; And well may he rejoice Who hath not heard of death's discordant noise. So might I too rejoice With such a voice.” “True, thou hast compassed death: but hast not thou The tree of life's own bough? Am I not Life and Resurrection now? My Cross balm-bearing bough For such as thou.” “Ah me, Thy Cross!—but that seems far away; Thy Cradle-song today I too would raise and worship Thee and pray: Not empty, Lord, today Send me away.” “If thou wilt not go empty, spend thy store; And I will give thee more, Yea, make thee ten times richer than before. Give more and give yet more Out of thy store.” “Because Thou givest me Thyself, I will Thy blessed word fulfil, Give with both hands, and hoard by giving still: Thy pleasure to fulfil, And work Thy Will.” MARY MAGDALENE AND THE OTHER MARY. A SONG FOR ALL MARIES. Our Master lies asleep and is at rest: His Heart has ceased to bleed, His Eye to weep: The sun ashamed has dropt down in the west: Our Master lies asleep. Now we are they who weep, and trembling keep Vigil, with wrung heart in a sighing breast, While slow time creeps, and slow the shadows creep. Renew Thy youth, as eagle from the nest; O Master, who hast sown, arise to reap:— No cock-crow yet, no flush on eastern crest: Our Master lies asleep. PATIENCE OF HOPE. The flowers that bloom in sun and shade And glitter in the dew, The flowers must fade. The birds that build their nest and sing When lovely Spring is new, Must soon take wing. The sun that rises in his strength To wake and warm the world, Must set at length. The sea that overflows the shore With billows frothed and curled, Must ebb once more. All come and go, all wax and wane, O Lord, save only Thou Who dost remain The Same to all eternity. All things which fail us now We trust to Thee. V Verses (1893) “OUT OF THE DEEP HAVE I CALLED UNTO THEE, O LORD.” [Alone Lord God, in Whom our trust and peace] Alone Lord God, in Whom our trust and peace, Our love and our desire, glow bright with hope; Lift us above this transitory scope Of earth, these pleasures that begin and cease, This moon which wanes, these seasons which decrease: We turn to Thee; as on an eastern slope Wheat feels the dawn beneath night's lingering cope, Bending and stretching sunward ere it sees. Alone Lord God, we see not yet we know; By love we dwell with patience and desire, And loving so and so desiring pray; Thy will be done in earth as heaven today; As yesterday it was, tomorrow so; Love offering love on love's self-feeding fire. [Seven vials hold Thy wrath: but what can hold] Seven vials hold Thy wrath: but what can hold Thy mercy save Thine own Infinitude Boundlessly overflowing with all good, All lovingkindness, all delights untold? Thy Love, of each created love the mould; Thyself, of all the empty plenitude; Heard of at Ephrata, found in the Wood, For ever One, the Same, and Manifold. Lord, give us grace to tremble with that dove Which Ark-bound winged its solitary way And overpast the Deluge in a day, Whom Noah's hand pulled in and comforted: For we who much more hang upon Thy Love Behold its shadow in the deed he did. “Where neither rust nor moth doth corrupt.” Nerve us with patience, Lord, to toil or rest, Toiling at rest on our allotted level; Unsnared, unscared by world or flesh or devil, Fulfilling the good Will of Thy behest; Not careful here to hoard, not here to revel; But waiting for our treasure and our zest Beyond the fading splendour of the west, Beyond this deathstruck life and deathlier evil. Not with the sparrow building here a house: But with the swallow tabernacling so As still to poise alert to rise and go On eager wings with wing-outspeeding wills Beyond earth's gourds and past her almond boughs, Past utmost bound of the everlasting hills. “As the sparks fly upwards.” Lord, grant us wills to trust Thee with such aim Of hope and passionate craving of desire, That we may mount aspiring, and aspire Still while we mount; rejoicing in Thy Name Yesterday, this day, day by day the Same: So sparks fly upward scaling heaven by fire, Still mount and still attain not, yet draw nigher While they have being to their fountain flame. To saints who mount, the bottomless abyss Is as mere nothing, they have set their face Onward and upward toward that blessèd place Where man rejoices with his God, and soul With soul, in the unutterable kiss Of peace for every victor at the goal. [Lord, make us all love all: that when we meet] Lord, make us all love all: that when we meet Even myriads of earth's myriads at Thy Bar, We may be glad as all true lovers are Who having parted count reunion sweet. Safe gathered home around Thy blessèd Feet, Come home by different roads from near or far, Whether by whirlwind or by flaming car, From pangs or sleep, safe folded round Thy seat. Oh, if our brother's blood cry out at us, How shall we meet Thee Who hast loved us all, Thee Whom we never loved, not loving him? The unloving cannot chant with Seraphim, Bear harp of gold or palm victorious, Or face the Vision Beatifical. [O lord, I am ashamed to seek Thy Face] O lord, I am ashamed to seek Thy Face As tho' I loved Thee as Thy saints love Thee: Yet turn from those Thy lovers, look on me, Disgrace me not with uttermost disgrace; But pour on me ungracious, pour Thy grace To purge my heart and bid my will go free, Till I too taste Thy hidden Sweetness, see Thy hidden Beauty in the holy place. O Thou Who callest sinners to repent, Call me Thy sinner unto penitence, For many sins grant me the greater love: Set me above the waterfloods, above Devil and shifting world and fleshly sense, Thy Mercy's all-amazing monument. [It is not death, O Christ, to die for Thee] It is not death, O Christ, to die for Thee: Nor is that silence of a silent land Which speaks Thy praise so all may understand: Darkness of death makes Thy dear lovers see Thyself Who Wast and Art and Art to Be; Thyself, more lovely than the lovely band Of saints who worship Thee on either hand, Loving and loved thro' all eternity. Death is not death, and therefore do I hope: Nor silence silence; and I therefore sing A very humble hopeful quiet psalm, Searching my heart-field for an offering; A handful of sun-courting heliotrope, Of myrrh a bundle, and a little balm. [Lord, grant us eyes to see and ears to hear] Lord, grant us eyes to see and ears to hear, And souls to love and minds to understand, And steadfast faces toward the Holy Land, And confidence of hope, and filial fear, And citizenship where Thy saints appear Before Thee heart in heart and hand in hand, And Alleluias where their chanting band As waters and as thunders fill the sphere. Lord, grant us what Thou wilt, and what Thou wilt Deny, and fold us in Thy peaceful fold: Not as the world gives, give to us Thine own: Inbuild us where Jerusalem is built With walls of jasper and with streets of gold, And Thou Thyself, Lord Christ, for Corner Stone. “Cried out with Tears.” Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief: Lord, I repent, help mine impenitence: Hide not Thy Face from me, nor spurn me hence, Nor utterly despise me in my grief; Nor say me nay, who worship with the thief Bemoaning my so long lost innocence:— Ah me! my penitence a fresh offence, Too tardy and too tepid and too brief. Lord, must I perish, I who look to Thee? Look Thou upon me, bid me live, not die; Say “Come,” say not “Depart,” tho' Thou art just: Yea, Lord, be mindful how out of the dust I look to Thee while Thou dost look on me, Thou Face to face with me and Eye to eye. [O Lord, on Whom we gaze and dare not gaze] O Lord, on Whom we gaze and dare not gaze, Increase our faith that gazing we may see, And seeing love, and loving worship Thee Thro' all our days, our long and lengthening days. O Lord, accessible to prayer and praise, Kind Lord, Companion of the two or three, Good Lord, be gracious to all men and me, Lighten our darkness and amend our ways. Call up our hearts to Thee, that where Thou art Our treasure and our heart may dwell at one: Then let the pallid moon pursue her sun, So long as it shall please Thee, far apart,— Yet art Thou with us, Thou to Whom we run, We hand in hand with Thee and heart in heart. “I will come and heal him.” O Lord God, hear the silence of each soul, Its cry unutterable of ruth and shame, Its voicelessness of self-contempt and blame: Nor suffer harp and palm and aureole Of multitudes who praise Thee at the goal, To set aside Thy poor and blind and lame; Nor blazing Seraphs utterly to outflame The spark that flies up from each earthly coal. My price Thy priceless Blood; and therefore I Price of Thy priceless Blood am precious so That good things love me in their love of Thee: I comprehend not why Thou lovedst me With Thy so mighty Love; but this I know, No man hath greater love than thus to die. [Ah Lord, Lord, if my heart were right with Thine] Ah Lord, Lord, if my heart were right with Thine As Thine with mine, then should I rest resigned Awaiting knowledge with a quiet mind Because of heavenly wisdom's anodyne. Then would Thy Love be more to me than wine, Then should I seek being sure at length to find, Then should I trust to Thee all humankind Because Thy Love of them is more than mine. Then should I stir up hope and comfort me Remembering Thy Cradle and Thy Cross; How Heaven to Thee without us had been loss, How Heaven with us is Thy one only Heaven, Heaven shared with us thro' all eternity, With us long sought, long loved, and much forgiven. “The gold of that land is good.” I long for joy, O Lord, I long for gold, I long for all Thou profferest to me, I long for the unimagined manifold Abundance laid up in Thy treasury. I long for pearls, but not from mundane sea; I long for palms, but not from earthly mould; Yet in all else I long for, long for Thee, Thyself to hear and worship and behold. For Thee, beyond the splendour of that day Where all is day and is not any night; For Thee, beyond refreshment of that rest To which tired saints press on for its delight:— Or if not thus for Thee, yet Thee I pray To make me long so till Thou make me blest. [Weigh all my faults and follies righteously] Weigh all my faults and follies righteously, Omissions and commissions, sin on sin; Make deep the scale, O Lord, to weigh them in; Yea, set the Accuser vulture-eyed to see All loads ingathered which belong to me: That so in life the judgement may begin, And Angels learn how hard it is to win One solitary sinful soul to Thee. I have no merits for a counterpoise: Oh vanity my work and hastening day, What can I answer to the accusing voice? Lord, drop Thou in the counterscale alone One Drop from Thine own Heart, and overweigh My guilt, my folly, even my heart of stone. [Lord, grant me grace to love Thee in my pain] Lord, grant me grace to love Thee in my pain, Thro' all my disappointment love Thee still, Thy love my strong foundation and my hill, Tho' I be such as cometh not again, A fading leaf, a spark upon the wane: So evermore do Thou Thy perfect Will Beloved thro' all my good, thro' all mine ill, Beloved tho' all my love beside be vain. If thus I love Thee, how wilt Thou love me, Thou Who art greater than my heart? (Amen!) Wilt Thou bestow a part, withhold a part? The longing of my heart cries out to Thee, The hungering thirsting longing of my heart: What I forewent wilt Thou not grant me then? [Lord, make me one with Thine own faithful ones] Lord, make me one with Thine own faithful ones, Thy Saints who love Thee and are loved by Thee; Till the day break and till the shadows flee, At one with them in alms and orisons; At one with him who toils and him who runs, And him who yearns for union yet to be; At one with all who throng the crystal sea And wait the setting of our moons and suns. Ah, my beloved ones gone on before, Who looked not back with hand upon the plough! If beautiful to me while still in sight, How beautiful must be your aspects now; Your unknown, well-known aspects in that light Which clouds shall never cloud for evermore. “Light of Light.” O Christ our Light, Whom even in darkness we (So we look up) discern and gaze upon, O Christ, Thou loveliest Light that ever shone, Thou Light of Light, Fount of all lights that be, Grant us clear vision of Thy Light to see, Tho' other lights elude us, or begone Into the secret of oblivion, Or gleam in places higher than man's degree. Who looks on Thee looks full on his desire, Who looks on Thee looks full on Very Love: Looking, he answers well, “What lack I yet?” His heat and cold wait not on earthly fire, His wealth is not of earth to lose or get; Earth reels, but he has stored his store above. CHRIST OUR ALL IN ALL. “The ransomed of the Lord.” Thy lovely saints do bring Thee love, Incense and joy and gold; Fair star with star, fair dove with dove, Beloved by Thee of old. I, Master, neither star nor dove, Have brought Thee sins and tears; Yet I too bring a little love Amid my flaws and fears. A trembling love that faints and fails Yet still is love of Thee, A wondering Love that hopes and hails Thy boundless Love of me; Love kindling faith and pure desire, Love following on to bliss, A spark, O Jesu, from Thy fire, A drop from Thine abyss. [Lord, we are rivers running to Thy sea] Lord, we are rivers running to Thy sea, Our waves and ripples all derived from Thee: A nothing we should have, a nothing be, Except for Thee. Sweet are the waters of Thy shoreless sea, Make sweet our waters that make haste to Thee; Pour in Thy sweetness, that ourselves may be Sweetness to Thee. “An exceeding bitter cry.” Contempt and pangs and haunting fears— Too late for hope, too late for ease, Too late for rising from the dead; Too late, too late to bend my knees, Or bow my head, Or weep, or ask for tears. Hark! . . . One I hear Who calls to me: “Give Me thy thorn and grief and scorn, Give Me thy ruin and regret. Press on thro' darkness toward the morn: One loves thee yet: Have I forgotten thee?” Lord, Who art Thou? Lord, is it Thou My Lord and God Lord Jesus Christ? How said I that I sat alone And desolate and unsufficed? Surely a stone Would raise Thy praises now! [O Lord, when Thou didst call me, didst Thou know] O Lord, when Thou didst call me, didst Thou know My heart disheartened thro' and thro', Still hankering after Egypt full in view Where cucumbers and melons grow? —“Yea, I knew.”— But, Lord, when Thou didst choose me, didst Thou know How marred I was and withered too, Nor rose for sweetness nor for virtue rue, Timid and rash, hasty and slow? —“Yea, I knew.”— My Lord, when Thou didst love me, didst Thou know How weak my efforts were, how few, Tepid to love and impotent to do, Envious to reap while slack to sow? —“Yea, I knew.”— Good Lord, Who knowest what I cannot know And dare not know, my false, my true, My new, my old; Good Lord, arise and do If loving Thou hast known me so. —“Yea, I knew.”— “Thou, God, seest me.” Ah me, that I should be Exposed and open evermore to Thee!— “Nay, shrink not from My light, And I will make thee glorious in My sight With the overcoming Shulamite.”— Yea, Lord, Thou moulding me. . . . Without a hiding-place To hide me from the terrors of Thy Face.— “Thy hiding-place is here In Mine own heart, wherefore the Roman spear For thy sake I accounted dear.”— My Jesus! King of Grace. . . . Without a veil, to give Whiteness before Thy Face that I might live.— “Am I too poor to dress Thee in My royal robe of righteousness? Challenge and prove My Love's excess.”— Give, Lord, I will receive. . . . Without a pool wherein To wash my piteous self and make me clean.— “My Blood hath washed away Thy guilt, and still I wash thee day by day: Only take heed to trust and pray.”— Lord, help me to begin. [Lord Jesus, who would think that I am Thine?] Lord Jesus, who would think that I am Thine? Ah, who would think Who sees me ready to turn back or sink, That Thou art mine? I cannot hold Thee fast tho' Thou art mine: Hold Thou me fast, So earth shall know at last and heaven at last That I am Thine. “The Name of Jesus.” Jesus, Lord God from all eternity, Whom love of us brought down to shame, All the rest is but vanity Which others strive to win: Where their hopes end my joys begin. I will not look upon a rose Though it is fair to see: The flowers planted in Paradise Are budding now for me. Red roses like love visible Are blowing on their tree, Or white like virgin purity. I will not look unto the sun Which setteth night by night: In the untrodden courts of Heaven My crown shall be more bright. Lo, in the New Jerusalem Founded and built aright My very feet shall tread on light. With foolish riches of this World I have bought treasure, where Nought perisheth: for this white veil I gave my golden hair; I gave the beauty of my face For vigils, fasts and prayer; I gave all for this Cross I bear. My heart trembled when first I took The vows which must be kept; At first it was a weariness To watch when once I slept. The path was rough and sharp with thorns; My feet bled as I stepped; The Cross was heavy and I wept. While still the names rang in mine ears Of daughter, sister, wife; The outside world still looked so fair To my weak eyes, and rife With beauty; my heart almost failed; Then in the desperate strife I prayed, as one who prays for life, Until I grew to love what once Had been so burdensome. So now when I am faint, because Hope deferred seems to numb My heart, I yet can plead; and say Although my lips are dumb: “The Spirit and the Bride say, Come.” Song. [We buried her among the flowers] We buried her among the flowers At falling of the leaf, And choked back all our tears; her joy Could never be our grief. She lies among the living flowers And grass, the only thing That perishes;—or is it that Our Autumn was her Spring? Doubtless, if we could see her face, The smile is settled there Which almost broke our hearts, when last We knelt by her in prayer. When with tired eyes and failing breath And hands crossed on her breast Perhaps she saw her Guardian spread His wings above her rest. So she sleeps hidden in the flowers: But yet a little while And we shall see her wake, and rise Fair, with the selfsame smile. Grain by grain, His hand Numbers the innumerable sand. Lord, I lift to Thee In peace what is and what shall be: Lord, in peace I trust To Thee all spirits and all dust. [Lord, carry me.—Nay, but I grant thee strength] Lord, carry me.—Nay, but I grant thee strength To walk and work thy way to Heaven at length.— Lord, why then am I weak?—Because I give Power to the weak, and bid the dying live.— Lord, I am tired.—He hath not much desired The goal, who at the starting-point is tired.— Lord, dost Thou know?—I know what is in man; What the flesh can, and what the spirit can.— Lord, dost Thou care?—Yea, for thy gain or loss So much I cared, it brought Me to the Cross.— Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.— Good is the word; but rise, for life is brief. The follower is not greater than the Chief: Follow thou Me along My way of grief. [Lord, I am here.—But, child, I look for thee] Lord, I am here.—But, child, I look for thee Elsewhere and nearer Me.— Lord, that way moans a wide insatiate sea: How can I come to Thee?— Set foot upon the water, test and see If thou canst come to Me.— Couldst Thou not send a boat to carry me, Or dolphin swimming free?— Nay, boat nor fish if thy will faileth thee: For My Will too is free.— O Lord, I am afraid.—Take hold on Me: I am stronger than the sea.— Save, Lord, I perish.—I have hold of thee, I made and rule the sea, I bring thee to the haven where thou wouldst be. [New creatures; the Creator still the Same] New creatures; the Creator still the Same For ever and for ever: therefore we Win hope from God's unsearchable decree And glorify His still unchanging Name. We too are still the same: and still our claim, Our trust, our stay, is Jesus, none but He: He still the Same regards us, and still we Mount toward Him in old love's accustomed flame. We know Thy wounded Hands: and Thou dost know Our praying hands, our hands that clasp and cling To hold Thee fast and not to let Thee go. All else be new then, Lord, as Thou hast said: Since it is Thou, we dare not be afraid, Our King of old and still our Self-same King. “King of kings and Lord of lords.” Is this that Name as ointment poured forth For which the virgins love Thee; King of kings And Lord of lords? All Seraphs clad in wings; All Cherubs and all Wheels which south and north, Which east and west turn not in going forth; All many-semblanced ordered Spirits, as rings Of rainbow in unwonted fashionings, Might answer, Yes. But we from south and north, From east and west, a feeble folk who came By desert ways in quest of land unseen, A promised land of pasture ever green And ever springing ever singing wave, Know best Thy Name of Jesus: Blessed Name, Man's life and resurrection from the grave. [Thy Name, O Christ, as incense streaming forth] Thy Name, O Christ, as incense streaming forth Sweetens our names before God's Holy Face; Luring us from the south and from the north Unto the sacred place. In Thee God's promise is Amen and Yea. What art Thou to us? Prize of every lot, Shepherd and Door, our Life and Truth and Way:— Nay, Lord, what art Thou not? “The Good Shepherd.” O Shepherd with the bleeding Feet, Good Shepherd with the pleading Voice, What seekest Thou from hill to hill? Sweet were the valley pastures, sweet The sound of flocks that bleat their joys, And eat and drink at will. Is one worth seeking, when Thou hast of Thine Ninety and nine?— How should I stay My bleeding Feet, How should I hush My pleading Voice? I Who chose death and clomb a hill, Accounting gall and wormwood sweet, That hundredfold might bud My joys For love's sake and good will. I seek My one, for all there bide of Mine Ninety and nine. “Rejoice with Me.” Little Lamb, who lost thee?— I myself, none other.— Little Lamb, who found thee?— Jesus, Shepherd, Brother. Ah, Lord, what I cost Thee! Canst Thou still desire?— Still Mine arms surround thee, Still I lift thee higher, Draw thee nigher. [Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?] Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Yea, Lord, altho' Thou say me nay: Shall not His Will be to me life and light? Yea, Lord, altho' Thou slay. Yet, Lord, remembering turn and sift and see, Remember tho' Thou sift me thro', Remember my desire, remember me, Remember, Lord, and do. [Me and my gift: kind Lord, behold] Me and my gift: kind Lord, behold, Be not extreme to test or sift; Thy Love can turn to fire and gold Me and my gift. Myself and mine to Thee I lift: Gather us to Thee from the cold Dead outer world where dead things drift. If much were mine, then manifold Should be the offering of my thrift: I am but poor, yet love makes bold Me and my gift. “He cannot deny Himself.” Love still is Love, and doeth all things well, Whether He show me heaven or hell Or earth in her decay Passing away On a day. Love still is Love, tho' He should say, “Depart,” And break my incorrigible heart, And set me out of sight Widowed of light In the night. Love still is Love, is Love, if He should say, “Come,” on that uttermost dread day; “Come,” unto very me, “Come where I be, Come and see.” Love still is Love, whatever comes to pass: O Only Love, make me Thy glass, Thy pleasure to fulfil By loving still Come what will. “Slain from the foundation of the world.” Slain for man, slain for me, O Lamb of God, look down; Loving to the end look down, behold and see: Turn Thine Eyes of pity, turn not on us Thy frown, O Lamb of God, slain for man, slain for me. Mark the wrestling, mark the race for indeed a crown; Mark our chariots how we drive them heavily; Mark the foe upon our track blasting thundering down, O Lamb of God, slain for man, slain for me. Set as a Cloudy Pillar against them Thy frown, Thy Face of Light toward us gracious utterly; Help granting, hope granting, until Thou grant a crown, O Lamb of God, slain for man, slain for me. [Lord Jesu, Thou art sweetness to my soul] Lord Jesu, Thou art sweetness to my soul: I to myself am bitterness: Regard my fainting struggle toward the goal, Regard my manifold distress, O Sweet Jesu. Thou art Thyself my goal, O Lord my King: Stretch forth Thy hand to save my soul: What matters more or less of journeying? While I touch Thee I touch my goal, O Sweet Jesu. [I, Lord, Thy foolish sinner low and small] I, Lord, Thy foolish sinner low and small, Lack all. His heart too high was set Who asked, What lack I yet? Woe's me at my most woeful pass! I, Lord, who scarcely dare adore, Weep sore: Steeped in this rotten world I fear to rot. Alas! what lack I not? Alas! alas for me! alas More and yet more!— Nay, stand up on thy feet, betaking thee To Me. Bring fear; but much more bring Hope to thy patient King: What, is My pleasure in thy death? I loved that youth who little knew The true Width of his want, yet worshipped with goodwill: So love I thee, and still Prolong thy day of grace and breath. Rise up and do.— Lord, let me know mine end, and certify When I Shall die and have to stand Helpless on Either Hand, Cut off, cut off, my day of grace.— Not so: for what is that to thee? I see The measure and the number of thy day: Keep patience, tho' I slay; Keep patience till thou see My Face. Follow thou Me. “Because He first loved us.” I was hungry, and Thou feddest me; Yea, Thou gavest drink to slake my thirst: O Lord, what love gift can I offer Thee Who hast loved me first?— Feed My hungry brethren for My sake; Give them drink, for love of them and Me: Love them as I loved thee, when Bread I brake In pure love of thee.— Yea, Lord, I will serve them by Thy grace; Love Thee, seek Thee, in them; wait and pray: Yet would I love Thyself, Lord, face to face, Heart to heart, one day.— Let today fulfil its daily task, Fill thy heart and hand to them and Me: Tomorrow thou shalt ask, and shalt not ask Half I keep for thee. [Lord, hast Thou so loved us, and will not we] Lord, hast Thou so loved us, and will not we Love Thee with heart and mind and strength and soul, Desiring Thee beyond our glorious goal, Beyond the heaven of heavens desiring Thee? Each saint, all saints cry out: Yea me, yea me, Thou hast desired beyond an aureole, Beyond Thy many Crowns, beyond the whole Ninety and nine unwandering family. Souls in green pastures of the watered land, Faint pilgrim souls wayfaring thro' the sand, Abide with Thee and in Thee are at rest: Yet evermore, kind Lord, renew Thy quest After new wanderers; such as once Thy Hand Gathered, Thy Shoulders bore, Thy Heart caressed. [As the dove which found no rest] As the dove which found no rest For the sole of her foot, flew back To the ark her only nest And found safety there; Because Noah put forth his hand, Drew her in from ruin and wrack, And was more to her than the land And the air: So my spirit, like that dove, Fleeth away to an ark Where dwelleth a Heart of Love, A Hand pierced to save, Tho' the sun and the moon should fail, Tho' the stars drop into the dark, And my body lay itself pale In a grave. “Thou art Fairer than the children of men.” A rose, a lily, and the Face of Christ Have all our hearts sufficed: For He is Rose of Sharon nobly born, Our Rose without a thorn; And He is Lily of the Valley, He Most sweet in purity. But when we come to name Him as He is, Godhead, Perfection, Bliss, All tongues fall silent, while pure hearts alone Complete their orison. “As the Apple Tree among the trees of the wood.” As one red rose in a garden where all other roses are white Blossoms alone in its glory, crowned all alone In a solitude of own sweetness and fragrance of own delight, With loveliness not another's and thorns its own; As one ruddy sun amid million orbs comely and colourless, Among all others, above all others is known; As it were alone in the garden, alone in the heavenly place, Chief and centre of all, in fellowship yet alone. [None other Lamb, none other Name] None other Lamb, none other Name, None other Hope in heaven or earth or sea, None other Hiding-place from guilt and shame, None beside Thee. My faith burns low, my hope burns low, Only my heart's desire cries out in me By the deep thunder of its want and woe, Cries out to Thee. Lord, Thou art Life tho' I be dead, Love's Fire Thou art however cold I be: Nor heaven have I, nor place to lay my head, Nor home, but Thee. “Thy Friend and thy Father's Friend forget not.” Friends, I commend to you the narrow way: Not because I, please God, will walk therein, But rather for the Love Feast of that day, The exceeding prize which whoso will may win. Earth is half spent and rotting at the core, Here hollow death's heads mock us with a grin, Here heartiest laughter leaves us tired and sore. Men heap up pleasures and enlarge desire, Outlive desire, and famished evermore Consume themselves within the undying fire. Yet not for this God made us: not for this Christ sought us far and near to draw us nigher, Sought us and found and paid our penalties. If one could answer “Nay” to God's command, Who shall say “Nay” when Christ pleads all He is For us, and holds us with a wounded Hand? “Surely He hath borne our griefs.” Christ's Heart was wrung for me, if mine is sore; And if my feet are weary, His have bled; He had no place wherein to lay His Head; If I am burdened, He was burdened more. The cup I drink, He drank of long before; He felt the unuttered anguish which I dread; He hungered Who the hungry thousands fed, And thirsted Who the world's refreshment bore. If grief be such a looking-glass as shows Christ's Face and man's in some sort made alike, Then grief is pleasure with a subtle taste: Wherefore should any fret or faint or haste? Grief is not grievous to a soul that knows Christ comes,—and listens for that hour to strike. “They toil not, neither do they spin.” Clother of the lily, Feeder of the sparrow, Father of the fatherless, dear Lord, Tho' Thou set me as a mark against Thine arrow, As a prey unto Thy sword, As a ploughed up field beneath Thy harrow, As a captive in Thy cord, Let that cord be love; and some day make my narrow Hallowed bed according to Thy Word. Amen. [Darkness and light are both alike to Thee] Darkness and light are both alike to Thee: Therefore to Thee I lift my darkened face; Upward I look with eyes that fail to see, Athirst for future light and present grace. I trust the Hand of Love I scarcely trace. With breath that fails I cry, Remember me: Add breath to breath, so I may run my race That where Thou art there may Thy servant be. For Thou art gulf and fountain of my love, I unreturning torrent to Thy sea, Yea, Thou the measureless ocean for my rill: Seeking I find, and finding seek Thee still: And oh! that I had wings as hath a dove, Then would I flee away to rest with Thee. “And now why tarriest thou?” Lord, grant us grace to mount by steps of grace From grace to grace nearer, my God, to Thee; Not tarrying for tomorrow, Lest we lie down in sorrow And never see Unveiled Thy Face. Life is a vapour vanishing in haste; Life is a day whose sun grows pale to set; Life is a stint and sorrow, One day and not the morrow; Precious, while yet It runs to waste. Lord, strengthen us; lest fainting by the way We come not to Thee, we who come from far; Lord, bring us to that morrow Which makes an end of sorrow, Where all saints are On holyday. Where all the saints rest who have heard Thy call, Have risen and striven and now rejoice in rest: Call us too home from sorrow To rest in Thee tomorrow; In Thee our Best, In Thee our All. [Have I not striven, my God, and watched and prayed?] Have I not striven, my God, and watched and prayed? Have I not wrestled in mine agony? Wherefore still turn Thy Face of Grace from me? Is Thine Arm shortened that Thou canst not aid? Thy silence breaks my heart: speak tho' to upbraid, For Thy rebuke yet bids us follow Thee. I grope and grasp not; gaze, but cannot see. When out of sight and reach my bed is made, And piteous men and women cease to blame Whispering and wistful of my gain or loss; Thou Who for my sake once didst feel the Cross, Lord, wilt Thou turn and look upon me then, And in Thy Glory bring to nought my shame, Confessing me to angels and to men? “God is our Hope and Strength.” Tempest and terror below; but Christ the Almighty above. Tho' the depth of the deep overflow, tho' fire run along on the ground, Tho' all billows and flames make a noise,—and where is an Ark for the dove?— Tho' sorrows rejoice against joys, and death and destruction abound: Yet Jesus abolisheth death, and Jesus Who loves us we love; His dead are renewed with a breath, His lost are the sought and the found. Thy wanderers call and recall, Thy dead men lift out of the ground; O Jesus, Who lovest us all, stoop low from Thy Glory above: Where sin hath abounded make grace to abound and to superabound, Till we gaze on Thee face unto Face, and respond to Thee love unto Love. [Day and night the Accuser makes no pause] Day and night the Accuser makes no pause, Day and night protest the Righteous Laws, Good and Evil witness to man's flaws; Man the culprit, man's the ruined cause, Man midway to death's devouring jaws And the worm that gnaws. Day and night our Jesus makes no pause, Pleads His own fulfilment of all laws, Veils with His Perfections mortal flaws, Clears the culprit, pleads the desperate cause, Plucks the dead from death's devouring jaws And the worm that gnaws. [O mine enemy] O mine enemy Rejoice not over me! Jesus waiteth to be gracious: I will yet arise, Mounting free and far, Past sun and star, To a house prepared and spacious In the skies. Lord, for Thine own sake Kindle my heart and break; Make mine anguish efficacious Wedded to Thine own: Be not Thy dear pain, Thy Love in vain, Thou Who waitest to be gracious On Thy Throne. [Lord, dost Thou look on me, and will not I] Lord, dost Thou look on me, and will not I Launch out my heart to Heaven to look on Thee? Here if one loved me I should turn to see, And often think on him and often sigh, And by a tender friendship make reply To love gratuitous poured forth on me, And nurse a hope of happy days to be, And mean “until we meet” in each good-bye. Lord, Thou dost look and love is in Thine Eyes, Thy Heart is set upon me day and night, Thou stoopest low to set me far above: O Lord, that I may love Thee make me wise; That I may see and love Thee grant me sight; And give me love that I may give Thee love. “Peace I leave with you.” Tumult and turmoil, trouble and toil, Yet peace withal in a painful heart; Never a grudge and never a broil, And ever the better part. O my King and my heart's own choice, Stretch Thy Hand to Thy fluttering dove; Teach me, call to me with Thy Voice, Wrap me up in Thy Love. [O Christ our All in each, our All in all!] O Christ our All in each, our All in all! Others have this or that, a love, a friend, A trusted teacher, a long-worked-for end: But what to me were Peter or were Paul Without Thee? fame or friend if such might be? Thee wholly will I love, Thee wholly seek, Follow Thy foot-track, hearken for Thy call. O Christ mine All in all, my flesh is weak, A trembling fawning tyrant unto me: Turn, look upon me, let me hear Thee speak: Tho' bitter billows of Thine utmost sea Swathe me, and darkness build around its wall, Yet will I rise, Thou lifting when I fall, And if Thou hold me fast, yet cleave to Thee. [Because Thy Love hath sought me] Because Thy Love hath sought me, All mine is Thine and Thine is mine: Because Thy Blood hath bought me, I will not be mine own but Thine. I lift my heart to Thy Heart, Thy Heart sole resting-place for mine: Shall Thy Heart crave for my heart, And shall not mine crave back for Thine? [Thy fainting spouse, yet still Thy spouse] Thy fainting spouse, yet still Thy spouse; Thy trembling dove, yet still Thy dove; Thine own by mutual vows, By mutual love. Recall Thy vows, if not her vows; Recall Thy Love, if not her love: For weak she is, Thy spouse, And tired, Thy dove. “Like as the hart desireth the water brooks.” My heart is yearning: Behold my yearning heart, And lean low to satisfy Its lonely beseeching cry, For Thou its fulness art. Turn, as once turning Thou didst behold Thy Saint In deadly extremity; Didst look, and win back to Thee His will frightened and faint. Kindle my burning From Thine unkindled Fire; Fill me with gifts and with grace That I may behold Thy Face, For Thee I desire. My heart is yearning, Yearning and thrilling thro' For Thy Love mine own of old, For Thy Love unknown, untold, Ever old, ever new. “That where I am, there ye may be also.” How know I that it looms lovely that land I have never seen, With morning-glories and heartsease and unexampled green, With neither heat nor cold in the balm-redolent air? Some of this, not all, I know; but this is so; Christ is there. How know I that blessedness befalls who dwell in Paradise, The outwearied hearts refreshing, rekindling the worn-out eyes, All souls singing, seeing, rejoicing everywhere? Nay, much more than this I know; for this is so; Christ is there. O Lord Christ, Whom having not seen I love and desire to love, O Lord Christ, Who lookest on me uncomely yet still Thy dove, Take me to Thee in Paradise, Thine own made fair; For whatever else I know, this thing is so; Thou art there. “Judge not according to the appearance.” Lord, purge our eyes to see Within the seed a tree, Within the glowing egg a bird, Within the shroud a butterfly: Till taught by such, we see Beyond all creatures Thee, And hearken for Thy tender word, And hear it, “Fear not: it is I.” [My God, wilt Thou accept, and will not we] My God, wilt Thou accept, and will not we Give aught to Thee? The kept we lose, the offered we retain Or find again. Yet if our gift were lost, we well might lose All for Thy use: Well lost for Thee, Whose Love is all for us Gratuitous. [A chill blank world. Yet over the utmost sea] A chill blank world. Yet over the utmost sea The light of a coming dawn is rising to me, No more than a paler shade of darkness as yet; While I lift my heart, O Lord, my heart unto Thee Who hast not forgotten me, yea, Who wilt not forget. Forget not Thy sorrowful servant, O Lord my God, Weak as I cry, faint as I cry underneath Thy rod, Soon to lie dumb before Thee a body devoid of breath, Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, a sod to the sod: Forget not my life, O my Lord, forget not my death. “The Chiefest among ten thousand.” O Jesu, better than Thy gifts Art Thou Thine only Self to us! Palm branch its triumph, harp uplifts Its triumph-note melodious: But what are such to such as we? O Jesu, better than Thy saints Art Thou Thine only Self to us! The heart faints and the spirit faints For only Thee all-Glorious, For Thee, O only Lord, for Thee. SOME FEASTS AND FASTS. ADVENT SUNDAY. Behold, the Bridegroom cometh: go ye out With lighted lamps and garlands round about To meet Him in a rapture with a shout. It may be at the midnight, black as pitch, Earth shall cast up her poor, cast up her rich. It may be at the crowing of the cock Earth shall upheave her depth, uproot her rock. For lo, the Bridegroom fetcheth home the Bride: His Hands are Hands she knows, she knows His Side. Like pure Rebekah at the appointed place, Veiled, she unveils her face to meet His Face. Like great Queen Esther in her triumphing, She triumphs in the Presence of her King. His Eyes are as a Dove's, and she's Dove-eyed; He knows His lovely mirror, sister, Bride. He speaks with Dove-voice of exceeding love, And she with love-voice of an answering Dove. Behold, the Bridegroom cometh: go we out With lamps ablaze and garlands round about To meet Him in a rapture with a shout. ADVENT Earth grown old, yet still so green, Deep beneath her crust of cold Nurses fire unfelt, unseen: Earth grown old. We who live are quickly told: Millions more lie hid between Inner swathings of her fold. When will fire break up her screen? When will life burst thro' her mould? Earth, earth, earth, thy cold is keen, Earth grown old. [Sooner or later: yet at last] Sooner or later: yet at last The Jordan must be past; It may be he will overflow His banks the day we go; It may be that his cloven deep Will stand up on a heap. Sooner or later: yet one day We all must pass that way; Each man, each woman, humbled, pale, Pass veiled within the veil; Child, parent, bride, companion, Alone, alone, alone. For none a ransom can be paid, A suretyship be made: I, bent by mine own burden, must Enter my house of dust; I, rated to the full amount, Must render mine account. When earth and sea shall empty all Their graves of great and small; When earth wrapped in a fiery flood Shall no more hide her blood; When mysteries shall be revealed; All secrets be unsealed; When things of night, when things of shame, Shall find at last a name, Pealed for a hissing and a curse Throughout the universe: Then Awful Judge, most Awful God, Then cause to bud Thy rod, To bloom with blossoms, and to give Almonds; yea, bid us live. I plead Thyself with Thee, I plead Thee in our utter need: Jesus, most Merciful of Men, Show mercy on us then; Lord God of Mercy and of men, Show mercy on us then. CHRISTMAS EVE. Christmas hath a darkness Brighter than the blazing noon, Christmas hath a chillness Warmer than the heat of June, Christmas hath a beauty Lovelier than the world can show: For Christmas bringeth Jesus, Brought for us so low. Earth, strike up your music, Birds that sing and bells that ring; Heaven hath answering music For all Angels soon to sing: Earth, put on your whitest Bridal robe of spotless snow: For Christmas bringeth Jesus, Brought for us so low. CHRISTMAS DAY. A baby is a harmless thing And wins our hearts with one accord, And Flower of Babies was their King, Jesus Christ our Lord: Lily of lilies He Upon His Mother's knee; Rose of roses, soon to be Crowned with thorns on leafless tree. A lamb is innocent and mild And merry on the soft green sod; And Jesus Christ, the Undefiled, Is the Lamb of God: Only spotless He Upon His Mother's knee; White and ruddy, soon to be Sacrificed for you and me. Nay, lamb is not so sweet a word, Nor lily half so pure a name; Another name our hearts hath stirred, Kindling them to flame: “Jesus” certainly Is music and melody: Heart with heart in harmony Carol we and worship we. CHRISTMASTIDE. Love came down at Christmas, Love all lovely, Love Divine; Love was born at Christmas, Star and Angels gave the sign. Worship we the Godhead, Love Incarnate, Love Divine; Worship we our Jesus: But wherewith for sacred sign? Love shall be our token, Love be yours and love be mine, Love to God and all men, Love for plea and gift and sign. ST. JOHN, APOSTLE. Earth cannot bar flame from ascending, Hell cannot bind light from descending, Death cannot finish life never ending. Eagle and sun gaze at each other, Eagle at sun, brother at Brother, Loving in peace and joy one another. O St. John, with chains for thy wages, Strong thy rock where the storm-blast rages, Rock of refuge, the Rock of Ages. Rome hath passed with her awful voice, Earth is passing with all her joys, Heaven shall pass away with a noise. So from us all follies that please us, So from us all falsehoods that ease us,— Only all saints abide with their Jesus. Jesus, in love looking down hither, Jesus, by love draw us up thither, That we in Thee may abide together. [“Beloved, let us love one another,” says St. John] “Beloved, let us love one another,” says St. John, Eagle of eagles calling from above: Words of strong nourishment for life to feed upon, “Beloved, let us love.” Voice of an eagle, yea, Voice of the Dove: If we may love, winter is past and gone; Publish we, praise we, for lo! it is enough. More sunny than sunshine that ever yet shone, Sweetener of the bitter, smoother of the rough, Highest lesson of all lessons for all to con, “Beloved, let us love.” HOLY INNOCENTS. They scarcely waked before they slept, They scarcely wept before they laughed; They drank indeed death's bitter draught, But all its bitterest dregs were kept And drained by Mothers while they wept. From Heaven the speechless Infants speak: Weep not (they say), our Mothers dear, For swords nor sorrows come not here. Now we are strong who were so weak, And all is ours we could not seek. We bloom among the blooming flowers, We sing among the singing birds; Wisdom we have who wanted words: Here morning knows not evening hours, All's rainbow here without the showers. And softer than our Mother's breast, And closer than our Mother's arm, Is here the Love that keeps us warm And broods above our happy nest. Dear Mothers, come: for Heaven is best. [Unspotted lambs to follow the one Lamb] Unspotted lambs to follow the one Lamb, Unspotted doves to wait on the one Dove; To whom Love saith, “Be with Me where I am,” And lo! their answer unto Love is love. For tho' I know not any note they know, Nor know one word of all their song above, I know Love speaks to them, and even so I know the answer unto Love is love. EPIPHANY. “Lord Babe, if Thou art He We sought for patiently, Where is Thy court? Hither may prophecy and star resort; Men heed not their report.”— “Bow down and worship, righteous man: This Infant of a span Is He man sought for since the world began!”— “Then, Lord, accept my gold, too base a thing For Thee, of all kings King.”— “Lord Babe, despite Thy youth I hold Thee of a truth Both Good and Great: But wherefore dost Thou keep so mean a state, Low-lying desolate?”— “Bow down and worship, righteous seer: The Lord our God is here Approachable, Who bids us all draw near.”— “Wherefore to Thee I offer frankincense, Thou Sole Omnipotence.”— “But I have only brought Myrrh; no wise afterthought Instructed me To gather pearls or gems, or choice to see Coral or ivory.”— “Not least thine offering proves thee wise: For myrrh means sacrifice, And He that lives, this Same is He that dies.”— “Then here is myrrh: alas! yea, woe is me That myrrh befitteth Thee.”— Myrrh, frankincense, and gold: And lo! from wintry fold Good-will doth bring A Lamb, the innocent likeness of this King Whom stars and seraphs sing: And lo! the bird of love, a Dove Flutters and coos above: And Dove and Lamb and Babe agree in love:— Come all mankind, come all creation hither, Come, worship Christ together. EPIPHANYTIDE. Trembling before Thee we fall down to adore Thee, Shamefaced and trembling we lift our eyes to Thee: O First and with the last! annul our ruined past, Rebuild us to Thy glory, set us free From sin and from sorrow to fall down and worship Thee. Full of pity view us, stretch Thy sceptre to us, Bid us live that we may give ourselves to Thee: O faithful Lord and True! stand up for us and do, Make us lovely, make us new, set us free— Heart and soul and spirit—to bring all and worship Thee. SEPTUAGESIMA. “So run that ye may obtain.” One step more, and the race is ended; One word more, and the lesson's done; One toil more, and a long rest follows At set of sun. Who would fail, for one step withholden? Who would fail, for one word unsaid? Who would fail, for a pause too early? Sound sleep the dead. One step more, and the goal receives us; One word more, and life's task is done; One toil more, and the Cross is carried And sets the sun. SEXAGESIMA. “Cursed is the ground for thy sake.” Yet earth was very good in days of old, And earth is lovely still: Still for the sacred flock she spreads the fold, For Sion rears the hill. Mother she is, and cradle of our race, A depth where treasures lie, The broad foundation of a holy place, Man's step to scale the sky. She spreads the harvest-field which Angels reap, And lo! the crop is white; She spreads God's Acre where the happy sleep All night that is not night. Earth may not pass till heaven shall pass away, Nor heaven may be renewed Except with earth: and once more in that day Earth shall be very good. [That Eden of earth's sunrise cannot vie] That Eden of earth's sunrise cannot vie With Paradise beyond her sunset sky Hidden on high. Four rivers watered Eden in her bliss, But Paradise hath One which perfect is In sweetnesses. Eden had gold, but Paradise hath gold Like unto glass of splendours manifold Tongue hath not told. Eden had sun and moon to make her bright; But Paradise hath God and Lamb for light, And hath no night. Unspotted innocence was Eden's best; Great Paradise shows God's fulfilled behest, Triumph and rest. Hail, Eve and Adam, source of death and shame! New life has sprung from death, and Jesu's Name Clothes you with fame. Hail Adam, and hail Eve! your children rise And call you blessed, in their glad surmise Of Paradise. QUINQUAGESIMA. Love is alone the worthy law of love: All other laws have presupposed a taint: Love is the law from kindled saint to saint, From lamb to lamb, from dove to answering dove. Love is the motive of all things that move Harmonious by free will without constraint: Love learns and teaches: love shall man acquaint With all he lacks, which all his lack is love. Because Love is the fountain, I discern The stream as love: for what but love should flow From fountain Love? not bitter from the sweet! I ignorant, have I laid claim to know? Oh, teach me, Love, such knowledge as is meet For one to know who is fain to love and learn. [Piteous my rhyme is] Piteous my rhyme is What while I muse of love and pain, Of love misspent, of love in vain, Of love that is not loved again: And is this all then? As long as time is, Love loveth. Time is but a span, The dalliance space of dying man: And is this all immortals can? The gain were small then. Love loves for ever, And finds a sort of joy in pain, And gives with nought to take again, And loves too well to end in vain: Is the gain small then? Love laughs at “never,” Outlives our life, exceeds the span Appointed to mere mortal man: All which love is and does and can Is all in all then. ASH WEDNESDAY. My God, my God, have mercy on my sin, For it is great; and if I should begin To tell it all, the day would be too small To tell it in. My God, Thou wilt have mercy on my sin For Thy Love's sake: yea, if I should begin To tell This all, the day would be too small To tell it in. [Good Lord, today] Good Lord, today I scarce find breath to say: Scourge, but receive me. For stripes are hard to bear, but worse Thy intolerable curse; So do not leave me. Good Lord, lean down In pity, tho' Thou frown; Smite, but retrieve me: For so Thou hold me up to stand And kiss Thy smiting hand, It less will grieve me. LENT. It is good to be last not first, Pending the present distress; It is good to hunger and thirst, So it be for righteousness. It is good to spend and be spent, It is good to watch and to pray: Life and Death make a goodly Lent So it leads us to Easter Day. EMBERTIDE. I saw a Saint.—How canst thou tell that he Thou sawest was a Saint?— I saw one like to Christ so luminously By patient deeds of love, his mortal taint Seemed made his groundwork for humility. And when he marked me downcast utterly Where foul I sat and faint, Then more than ever Christ-like kindled he; And welcomed me as I had been a saint, Tenderly stooping low to comfort me. Christ bade him, “Do thou likewise.” Wherefore he Waxed zealous to acquaint His soul with sin and sorrow, if so be He might retrieve some latent saint:— “Lo, I, with the child God hath given to me!” MID-LENT. Is any grieved or tired? Yea, by God's Will: Surely God's Will alone is good and best: O weary man, in weariness take rest, O hungry man, by hunger feast thy fill. Discern thy good beneath a mask of ill, Or build of loneliness thy secret nest: At noon take heart, being mindful of the west, At night wake hope, for dawn advances still. At night wake hope. Poor soul, in such sore need Of wakening and of girding up anew, Hast thou that hope which fainting doth pursue? No saint but hath pursued and hath been faint; Bid love wake hope, for both thy steps shall speed, Still faint yet still pursuing, O thou saint. PASSIONTIDE. It is the greatness of Thy love, dear Lord, that we would celebrate With sevenfold powers. Our love at best is cold and poor, at best unseemly for Thy state, This best of ours. Creatures that die, we yet are such as Thine own hands deigned to create: We frail as flowers, We bitter bondslaves ransomed at a price incomparably great To grace Heaven's bowers. Thou callest: “Come at once”—and still Thou callest us: “Come late, tho' late”— (The moments fly)— “Come, every one that thirsteth, come”—“Come prove Me, knocking at My gate”— (Some souls draw nigh!)— “Come thou who waiting seekest Me”—“Come thou for whom I seek and wait”— (Why will we die?)— “Come and repent: come and amend: come joy the joys unsatiate”— —(Christ passeth by . . .)— Lord, pass not by—I come—and I—and I. Amen. PALM SUNDAY. “He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.” I lift mine eyes, and see Thee, tender Lord, in pain upon the tree, Athirst for my sake and athirst for me. “Yea, look upon Me there, Compassed with thorns and bleeding everywhere, For thy sake bearing all, and glad to bear.” I lift my heart to pray: Thou Who didst love me all that darkened day, Wilt Thou not love me to the end alway? “Yea, thee My wandering sheep, Yea, thee My scarlet sinner slow to weep, Come to Me, I will love thee and will keep.” Yet am I racked with fear: Behold the unending outer darkness drear, Behold the gulf unbridgeable and near! “Nay, fix thy heart, thine eyes, Thy hope upon My boundless sacrifice: Will I lose lightly one so dear-bought prize?” Ah, Lord; it is not Thou, Thou that wilt fail; yet woe is me, for how Shall I endure who half am failing now? “Nay, weld thy resolute will To Mine: glance not aside for good or ill: I love thee; trust Me still and love Me still.” Yet Thou Thyself hast said, When Thou shalt sift the living from the dead Some must depart shamed and uncomforted. “Judge not before that day: Trust Me with all thy heart, even tho' I slay: Trust Me in love, trust on, love on, and pray.” MONDAY IN HOLY WEEK. “The Voice of my Beloved.” Once I ached for thy dear sake: Wilt thou cause Me now to ache? Once I bled for thee in pain: Wilt thou rend My Heart again? Crown of thorns and shameful tree, Bitter death I bore for thee, Bore My Cross to carry thee, And wilt thou have nought of Me? TUESDAY IN HOLY WEEK. By Thy long-drawn anguish to atone, Jesus Christ, show mercy on Thine own: Jesus Christ, show mercy and atone Not for other sake except Thine own. Thou Who thirsting on the Cross didst see All mankind and all I love and me, Still from Heaven look down in love and see All mankind and all I love and me. WEDNESDAY IN HOLY WEEK. Man's life is death. Yet Christ endured to live, Preaching and teaching, toiling to and fro, Few men accepting what He yearned to give, Few men with eyes to know His Face, that Face of Love He stooped to show. Man's death is life. For Christ endured to die In slow unuttered weariness of pain, A curse and an astonishment, passed by, Pointed at, mocked again By men for whom He shed His Blood—in vain? MAUNDY THURSDAY. “And the Vine said . . . Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?” The great Vine left its glory to reign as Forest King. “Nay,” quoth the lofty forest trees, “we will not have this thing; We will not have this supple one enring us with its ring. Lo, from immemorial time our might towers shadowing: Not we were born to curve and droop, not we to climb and cling: We buffet back the buffeting wind, tough to its buffeting: We screen great beasts, the wild fowl build in our heads and sing, Every bird of every feather from off our tops takes wing: I a king, and thou a king, and what king shall be our king?” Nevertheless the great Vine stooped to be the Forest King, While the forest swayed and murmured like seas that are tempesting: Stooped and drooped with thousand tendrils in thirsty languishing; Bowed to earth and lay on earth for earth's replenishing; Put off sweetness, tasted bitterness, endured time's fashioning; Put off life and put on death: and lo! it was all to bring All its fellows down to a death which hath lost the sting, All its fellows up to a life in endless triumphing,— I a king, and thou a king, and this King to be our King. GOOD FRIDAY MORNING. “Bearing His Cross.” Up Thy Hill of Sorrows Thou all alone, Jesus, man's Redeemer, Climbing to a Throne: Thro' the world triumphant, Thro' the Church in pain, Which think to look upon Thee No more again. Upon my hill of sorrows I, Lord, with Thee, Cheered, upheld, yea, carried, If a need should be: Cheered, upheld, yea, carried, Never left alone, Carried in Thy heart of hearts To a throne. GOOD FRIDAY. Lord Jesus Christ, grown faint upon the Cross, A sorrow beyond sorrow in Thy look, The unutterable craving for my soul; Thy love of me sufficed To load upon Thee and make good my loss In face of darkened heaven and earth that shook:— In face of earth and heaven, take Thou my whole Heart, O Lord Jesus Christ. GOOD FRIDAY EVENING. “Bring forth the Spear.” No Cherub's heart or hand for us might ache, No Seraph's heart of fire had half sufficed: Thine own were pierced and broken for our sake, O Jesus Christ. Therefore we love Thee with our faint good-will, We crave to love Thee not as heretofore, To love Thee much, to love Thee more, and still More and yet more. “A bundle of myrrh is my Well-beloved unto me.” Thy Cross cruciferous doth flower in all And every cross, dear Lord, assigned to us: Ours lowly-statured crosses; Thine how tall, Thy Cross cruciferous. Thy Cross alone life-giving, glorious: For love of Thine, souls love their own when small, Easy and light, or great and ponderous. Since deep calls deep, Lord, hearken when we call; When cross calls Cross racking and emulous:— Remember us with him who shared Thy gall, Thy Cross cruciferous. EASTER EVEN. The tempest over and gone, the calm begun, Lo, “it is finished” and the Strong Man sleeps: All stars keep vigil watching for the sun, The moon her vigil keeps. A garden full of silence and of dew Beside a virgin cave and entrance stone: Surely a garden full of Angels too, Wondering, on watch, alone. They who cry “Holy, Holy, Holy,” still Veiling their faces round God's Throne above, May well keep vigil on this heavenly hill And cry their cry of love, Adoring God in His new mystery Of Love more deep than hell, more strong than death; Until the day break and the shadows flee, The Shaking and the Breath. Our Church Palms are budding willow twigs. While Christ lay dead the widowed world More willow green for hope undone: Till, when bright Easter dews impearled The chilly burial earth, All north and south, all east and west, Flushed rosy in the arising sun; Hope laughed, and Faith resumed her rest, And Love remembered mirth. EASTER DAY. Words cannot utter Christ His returning: Mankind, keep jubilee, Strip off your mourning, Crown you with garlands, Set your lamps burning. Speech is left speechless; Set you to singing, Fling your hearts open wide, Set your bells ringing: Christ the Chief Reaper Comes, His sheaf bringing. Earth wakes her song-birds, Puts on her flowers, Leads out her lambkins, Builds up her bowers: This is man's spousal day, Christ's day and ours. EASTER MONDAY. Out in the rain a world is growing green, On half the trees quick buds are seen Where glued-up buds have been. Out in the rain God's Acre stretches green, Its harvest quick tho' still unseen: For there the Life hath been. If Christ hath died His brethren well may die, Sing in the gate of death, lay by This life without a sigh: For Christ hath died and good it is to die; To sleep whenso He lays us by, Then wake without a sigh. Yea, Christ hath died, yea, Christ is risen again: Wherefore both life and death grow plain To us who wax and wane; For Christ Who rose shall die no more again: Amen: till He makes all things plain Let us wax on and wane. EASTER TUESDAY. “Together with my dead body shall they arise.” Shall my dead body arise? then amen and yea On track of a home beyond the uttermost skies Together with my dead body shall they. We know the way: thank God Who hath showed us the way! Jesus Christ our Way to beautiful Paradise, Jesus Christ the Same for ever, the Same today. Five Virgins replenish with oil their lamps, being wise, Five Virgins awaiting the Bridegroom watch and pray: And if I one day spring from my grave to the prize, Together with my dead body shall they. ROGATIONTIDE. Who scatters tares shall reap no wheat, But go hungry while others eat. Who sows the wind shall not reap grain; The sown wind whirleth back again. What God opens must open be, Tho' man pile the sand of the sea. What God shuts is opened no more, Tho' man weary himself to find the door. ASCENSION EVE. O Lord Almighty, Who hast formed us weak, With us whom Thou hast formed deal fatherly; Be found of us whom Thou has deigned to seek, Be found that we the more may seek for Thee; Lord, speak and grant us ears to hear Thee speak; Lord, come to us and grant us eyes to see; Lord, make us meek, for Thou Thyself art meek; Lord, Thou art Love, fill us with charity. O Thou the Life of living and of dead, Who givest more the more Thyself hast given, Suffice us as Thy saints Thou hast sufficed; That beautified, replenished, comforted, Still gazing off from earth and up at heaven We may pursue Thy steps, Lord Jesus Christ. ASCENSION DAY. “A Cloud received Him out of their sight.” When Christ went up to Heaven the Apostles stayed Gazing at Heaven with souls and wills on fire, Their hearts on flight along the track He made, Winged by desire. Their silence spake: “Lord, why not follow Thee? Home is not home without Thy Blessed Face, Life is not life. Remember, Lord, and see, Look back, embrace. “Earth is one desert waste of banishment, Life is one long-drawn anguish of decay. Where Thou wert wont to go we also went: Why not today?” Nevertheless a cloud cut off their gaze: They tarry to build up Jerusalem, Watching for Him, while thro' the appointed days He watches them. They do His Will, and doing it rejoice, Patiently glad to spend and to be spent: Still He speaks to them, still they hear His Voice And are content. For as a cloud received Him from their sight, So with a cloud will He return ere long: Therefore they stand on guard by day, by night, Strenuous and strong. They do, they dare, they beyond seven times seven Forgive, they cry God's mighty word aloud: Yet sometimes haply lift tired eyes to Heaven— “Is that His cloud?” WHITSUN EVE. “As many as I love.”—Ah, Lord, Who lovest all, If thus it is with Thee why sit remote above, Beholding from afar, stumbling and marred and small, So many Thou dost love? Whom sin and sorrow make their worn reluctant thrall; Who fain would flee away but lack the wings of dove; Who long for love and rest; who look to Thee, and call To Thee for rest and love. WHITSUN DAY. “When the Day of Pentecost was fully come.” At sound as of rushing wind, and sight as of fire, Lo! flesh and blood made spirit and fiery flame, Ambassadors in Christ's and the Father's Name, To woo back a world's desire. These men chose death for their life and shame for their boast, For fear courage, for doubt intuition of faith, Chose love that is strong as death and stronger than death In the power of the Holy Ghost. WHITSUN MONDAY. “A pure River of Water of Life.” We know not a voice of that River, If vocal or silent it be, Where for ever and ever and ever It flows to no sea. More deep than the seas is that River, More full than their manifold tides, Where for ever and ever and ever It flows and abides. Pure gold is the bed of that River (The gold of that land is the best), Where for ever and ever and ever It flows on at rest. Oh goodly the banks of that River, Oh goodly the fruits that they bear, Where for ever and ever and ever It flows and is fair. For lo! on each bank of that River The Tree of Life life-giving grows, Where for ever and ever and ever The Pure River flows. WHITSUN TUESDAY. Lord Jesus Christ, our Wisdom and our Rest, Who wisely dost reveal and wisely hide, Grant us such grace in wisdom to abide According to Thy Will whose Will is best. Contented with Thine uttermost behest, Too sweet for envy and too high for pride; All simple-souled, dove-hearted and dove-eyed, Soft-voiced, and satisfied in humble nest. Wondering at the bounty of Thy Love Which gives us wings of silver and of gold; Wings folded close, yet ready to unfold When Thou shalt say, “Winter is past and gone:” When Thou shalt say, “Spouse, sister, love and dove, Come hither, sit with Me upon My Throne.” TRINITY SUNDAY. My God, Thyself being Love Thy heart is love, And love Thy Will and love Thy Word to us, Whether Thou show us depths calamitous Or heights and flights of rapturous peace above. O Christ the Lamb, O Holy Ghost the Dove, Reveal the Almighty Father unto us; That we may tread Thy courts felicitous, Loving Who loves us, for our God is Love. Lo, if our God be Love thro' heaven's long day, Love is He thro' our mortal pilgrimage, Love was He thro' all aeons that are told. We change, but Thou remainest; for Thine age Is, Was, and Is to come, nor new nor old; We change, but Thou remainest; yea and yea! CONVERSION OF ST. PAUL. O blessed Paul elect to grace, Arise and wash away thy sin, Anoint thy head and wash thy face, Thy gracious course begin. To start thee on thy outrunning race Christ shows the splendour of His Face: What will that Face of splendour be When at the goal He welcomes thee? [In weariness and painfulness St. Paul] In weariness and painfulness St. Paul Served God and pleased Him: after-saints no less Can wait on and can please Him, one and all In weariness and painfulness, By faith and hope triumphant thro' distress: Not with the rankling service of a thrall; But even as loving children trust and bless, Weep and rejoice, answering their Father's call, Work with tired hands, and forward upward press On sore tired feet still rising when they fall, In weariness and painfulness. VIGIL OF THE PRESENTATION. Long and dark the nights, dim and short the days, Mounting weary heights on our weary ways, Thee our God we praise. Scaling heavenly heights by unearthly ways, Thee our God we praise all our nights and days, Thee our God we praise. FEAST OF THE PRESENTATION. O Firstfruits of our grain, Infant and Lamb appointed to be slain, A Virgin and two doves were all Thy train, With one old man for state, When Thou didst enter first Thy Father's gate. Since then Thy train hath been Freeman and bondman, bishop, king and queen, With flaming candles and with garlands green: Oh happy all who wait One day or thousand days around Thy gate. And these have offered Thee, Beside their hearts, great stores for charity, Gold, frankincense and myrrh; if such may be For savour or for state Within the threshold of Thy golden gate. Then snowdrops and my heart I'll bring, to find those blacker than Thou art: Yet, loving Lord, accept us in good part; And give me grace to wait A bruised reed bowed low before Thy gate. THE PURIFICATION OF ST. MARY THE VIRGIN. Purity born of a Maid: Was such a Virgin defiled? Nay, by no shade of a shade. She offered her gift of pure love, A dove with a fair fellow-dove. She offered her Innocent Child The Essence and Author of Love; The Lamb that indwelt by the Dove Was spotless and holy and mild; More pure than all other, More pure than His Mother, Her God and Redeemer and Child. VIGIL OF THE ANNUNCIATION. All weareth, all wasteth, All flitteth, all hasteth, All of flesh and time:— Sound, sweet heavenly chime, Ring in the unutterable eternal prime. Man hopeth, man feareth, Man droopeth:—Christ cheereth, Compassing release, Comforting with peace, Promising rest where strife and anguish cease. Saints waking, saints sleeping, Rest well in safe keeping; Well they rest today While they watch and pray,— But their tomorrow's rest what tongue shall say? FEAST OF THE ANNUNCIATION. Whereto shall we liken this Blessed Mary Virgin, Fruitful shoot from Jesse's root graciously emerging? Lily we might call her, but Christ alone is white; Rose delicious, but that Jesus is the one Delight; Flower of women, but her Firstborn is mankind's one flower: He the Sun lights up all moons thro' their radiant hour. “Blessed among women, highly favoured,” thus Glorious Gabriel hailed her, teaching words to us: Whom devoutly copying we too cry “All hail!” Echoing on the music of glorious Gabriel. [Herself a rose, who bore the Rose] Herself a rose, who bore the Rose, She bore the Rose and felt its thorn. All Loveliness new-born Took on her bosom its repose, And slept and woke there night and morn. Lily herself, she bore the one Fair Lily; sweeter, whiter, far Than she or others are: The Sun of Righteousness her Son, She was His morning star. She gracious, He essential Grace, He was the Fountain, she the rill: Her goodness to fulfil And gladness, with proportioned pace He led her steps thro' good and ill. Christ's mirror she of grace and love, Of beauty and of life and death: By hope and love and faith Transfigured to His Likeness, “Dove, Spouse, Sister, Mother,” Jesus saith. ST. MARK. Once like a broken bow Mark sprang aside: Yet grace recalled him to a worthier course, To feeble hands and knees increasing force, Till God was magnified. And now a strong Evangelist, St. Mark Hath for his sign a Lion in his strength; And thro' the stormy water's breadth and length He helps to steer God's Ark. Thus calls he sinners to be penitents, He kindles penitents to high desire, He mounts before them to the sphere of saints, And bids them come up higher. ST. BARNABAS. “Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand.” —Acts xxi. 3. “We sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.” —Acts xxvii. 4. St. Barnabas, with John his sister's son, Set sail for Cyprus; leaving in their wake That chosen Vessel, who for Jesus' sake Proclaimed the Gentiles and the Jews at one. Divided while united, each must run His mighty course not hell should overtake; And pressing toward the mark must own the ache Of love, and sigh for heaven not yet begun. For saints in life-long exile yearn to touch Warm human hands, and commune face to face; But these we know not ever met again: Yet once St. Paul at distance overmuch Just sighted Cyprus; and once more in vain Neared it and passed;—not there his landing-place. VIGIL OF ST. PETER. O Jesu, gone so far apart Only my heart can follow Thee, That look which pierced St. Peter's heart Turn now on me. Thou Who dost search me thro' and thro' And mark the crooked ways I went, Look on me, Lord, and make me too Thy penitent. ST. PETER. “Launch out into the deep,” Christ spake of old To Peter: and he launched into the deep; Strengthened should tempest wake which lay asleep, Strengthened to suffer heat or suffer cold. Thus, in Christ's Prescience: patient to behold A fall, a rise, a scaling Heaven's high steep; Prescience of Love, which deigned to overleap The mire of human errors manifold. Lord, Lover of Thy Peter, and of him Beloved with craving of a humbled heart Which eighteen hundred years have satisfied; Hath he his throne among Thy Seraphim Who love? or sits he on a throne apart, Unique, near Thee, to love Thee human-eyed? [St. Peter once: “Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?”—] St. Peter once: “Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?”— Much more I say: Lord, dost Thou stand and knock At my closed heart more rugged than a rock, Bolted and barred, for Thy soft touch unmeet, Nor garnished nor in any wise made sweet? Owls roost within and dancing satyrs mock. Lord, I have heard the crowing of the cock And have not wept: ah, Lord, Thou knowest it. Yet still I hear Thee knocking, still I hear: “Open to Me, look on Me eye to eye, That I may wring thy heart and make it whole; And teach thee love because I hold thee dear, And sup with thee in gladness soul with soul, And sup with thee in glory by and by.” [I followed Thee, my God, I followed Thee] I followed Thee, my God, I followed Thee To see the end: I turned back flying from Gethsemane, Turned back on flying steps to see Thy Face, my God, my Friend. Even fleeing from Thee my heart clave to Thee: I turned perforce Constrained, yea chained by love which maketh free; I turned perforce, and silently Followed along Thy course. Lord, didst Thou know that I was following Thee? I weak and small Yet Thy true lover, mean tho' I must be, Sinning and sorrowing—didst Thou see? O Lord, Thou sawest all. I thought I had been strong to die for Thee; I disbelieved Thy word of warning spoken patiently: My heart cried, “That be far from me,” Till Thy bruised heart I grieved. Once I had urged: “Lord, this be far from Thee:”— Rebel to light, It needed first that Thou shouldst die for me Or ever I could plumb and see Love's lovely depth and height. Alas that I should trust myself, not Thee; Not trust Thy word: I faithless slumberer in Gethsemane, Blinded and rash; who instantly Put trust, but in a sword. Ah Lord, if even at the last in Thee I had put faith, I might even at the last have counselled me, And not have heaped up cruelty To sting Thee in Thy death. Alas for me, who bore to think on Thee And yet to lie: While Thou, O Lord, didst bear to look on me Goaded by fear to blasphemy, And break my heart and die. No balm I find in Gilead, yet in Thee Nailed to Thy palm I find a balm that wrings and comforts me: Balm wrung from Thee by agony, My balm, mine only balm. Oh blessed John who standeth close to Thee, With Magdalene, And Thine own Mother praying silently, Yea, blessed above women she, Now blessed even as then. And blessed the scorned thief who hangs by Thee, Whose thirsting mouth Thirsts for Thee more than water, whose eyes see, Whose lips confess in ecstasy Nor feel their parching drouth. Like as the hart the water-brooks I Thee Desire, my hands I stretch to Thee; O kind Lord, pity me: Lord, I have wept, wept bitterly, I driest of dry lands. Lord, I am standing far far off from Thee; Yet is my heart Hanging with Thee upon the accursed tree; The nails, the thorns, pierce Thee and me: My God, I claim my part. Scarce in Thy throne and kingdom; yet with Thee In shame, in loss, In Thy forsaking, in Thine agony: Love crucified, behold even me, Me also bear Thy cross. VIGIL OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW. Lord, to Thine own grant watchful hearts and eyes; Hearts strung to prayer, awake while eyelids sleep; Eyes patient till the end to watch and weep. So will sleep nourish power to wake and rise With Virgins who keep vigil and are wise, To sow among all sowers who shall reap, From out man's deep to call Thy vaster deep, And tread the uphill track to Paradise. Sweet souls! so patient that they make no moan, So calm on journey that they seem at rest, So rapt in prayer that half they dwell in heaven Thankful for all withheld and all things given; So lit by love that Christ shines manifest Transfiguring their aspects to His own. ST. BARTHOLOMEW. He bore an agony whereof the name Hath turned his fellows pale: But what if God should call us to the same, Should call, and we should fail? Nor earth nor sea could swallow up our shame, Nor darkness draw a veil: For he endured that agony whose name Hath made his fellows quail. ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS. “Ye that excel in strength.” Service and strength, God's Angels and Archangels; His Seraphs fires, and lamps His Cherubim: Glory to God from highest and from lowest, Glory to God in everlasting hymn From all His creatures. Princes that serve, and Powers that work His pleasure, Heights that soar to'ard Him, Depths that sink to'ard Him; Flames fire out-flaming, chill beside His Essence; Insight all-probing, save where scant and dim To'ard its Creator. Sacred and free exultant in God's pleasure, His Will their solace, thus they wait on Him; And shout their shout of ecstasy eternal, And trim their splendours that they burn not dim To'ard their Creator. Wherefore with Angels, wherefore with Archangels, With lofty Cherubs, loftier Seraphim, We laud and magnify our God Almighty, And veil our faces rendering love to Him With all His creatures. VIGIL OF ALL SAINTS. Up, my drowsing eyes! Up, my sinking heart! Up to Jesus Christ arise! Claim your part In all raptures of the skies. Yet a little while, Yet a little way, Saints shall reap and rest and smile All the day. Up! let's trudge another mile. ALL SAINTS. As grains of sand, as stars, as drops of dew, Numbered and treasured by the Almighty Hand, The Saints triumphant throng that holy land Where all things and Jerusalem are new. We know not half they sing or half they do, But this we know, they rest and understand; While like a conflagration freshly fanned Their love glows upward, outward, thro' and thro'. Lo! like a stream of incense launched on flame Fresh Saints stream up from death to life above, To shine among those others and rejoice: What matters tribulation whence they came? All love and only love can find a voice Where God makes glad His Saints, for God is Love. ALL SAINTS: MARTYRS. Once slain for Him Who first was slain for them, Now made alive in Him for evermore, All luminous and lovely in their gore With no more buffeting winds or tides to stem The Martyrs look for New Jerusalem; And cry “How long?” remembering all they bore, “How long?” with heart and eyes sent on before Toward consummated throne and diadem. “How long?” White robes are given to their desire; “How long?” deep rest that is and is to be; With a great promise of the oncoming host, Loves to their love and fires to flank their fire: So rest they, worshipping incessantly One God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. “I gave a sweet smell.” Saints are like roses when they flush rarest, Saints are like lilies when they bloom fairest, Saints are like violets sweetest of their kind: Bear in mind This today. Then tomorrow: All like roses rarer than the rarest, All like lilies fairer than the fairest, All like violets sweeter than we know. Be it so. Tomorrow blots out sorrow. [Hark! the Alleluias of the great salvation] Hark! the Alleluias of the great salvation Still beginning, never ending, still begin, The thunder of an endless adoration: Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation Which have kept the truth may enter in. Roll ye back, ye pearls, on your twelvefold station: No more deaths to die, no more fights to win! Lift your heads, ye gates, that the righteous nation Led by the Great Captain of their sole salvation, Having kept the truth, may enter in. A SONG FOR THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS. Love is the key of life and death, Of hidden heavenly mystery: Of all Christ is, of all He saith, Love is the key. As three times to His Saint He saith, He saith to me, He saith to thee, Breathing His Grace-conferring Breath: “Lovest thou Me?” Ah, Lord, I have such feeble faith, Such feeble hope to comfort me: But love it is, is strong as death, And I love Thee. SUNDAY BEFORE ADVENT. The end of all things is at hand. We all Stand in the balance trembling as we stand; Or if not trembling, tottering to a fall. The end of all things is at hand. O hearts of men, covet the unending land! O hearts of men, covet the musical, Sweet, never-ending waters of that strand! While Earth shows poor, a slippery rolling ball, And Hell looms vast, a gulf unplumbed, unspanned, And Heaven flings wide its gates to great and small, The end of all things is at hand. GIFTS AND GRACES. [Love loveth Thee, and wisdom loveth Thee] Love loveth Thee, and wisdom loveth Thee: The love that loveth Thee sits satisfied; Wisdom that loveth Thee grows million-eyed, Learning what was, and is, and is to be. Wisdom and love are glad of all they see; Their heart is deep, their hope is not denied; They rock at rest on time's unresting tide, And wait to rest thro' long eternity. Wisdom and love and rest, each holy soul Hath these today while day is only night: What shall souls have when morning brings to light Love, wisdom, rest, God's treasure stored above? Palm shall they have, and harp and aureole, Wisdom, rest, love—and lo! the whole is love. [Lord, give me love that I may love Thee much] Lord, give me love that I may love Thee much, Yea, give me love that I may love Thee more, And all for love may worship and adore And touch Thee with love's consecrated touch. I halt today; be love my cheerful crutch, My feet to plod, some day my wings to soar: Some day; but, Lord, not any day before Thou call me perfect, having made me such. This is a day of love, a day of sorrow, Love tempering sorrow to a sort of bliss; A day that shortens while we call it long: A longer day of love will dawn tomorrow, A longer, brighter, lovelier day than this, Endless, all love, no sorrow, but a song. “As a king, . . . . unto the King.” Love doth so grace and dignify That beggars treat as king with king Before the Throne of God most High: Love recognises love's own cry, And stoops to take love's offering. A loving heart, tho' soiled and bruised; A kindling heart, tho' cold before; Who ever came and was refused By Love? Do, Lord, as Thou art used To do, and make me love Thee more. [O ye who love today] O ye who love today, Turn away From Patience with her silver ray: For Patience shows a twilight face, Like a half-lighted moon When daylight dies apace. But ye who love tomorrow Beg or borrow Today some bitterness of sorrow: For Patience shows a lustrous face, In depth of night her noon; Then to her sun gives place. [Life that was born today] Life that was born today Must make no stay, But tend to end As blossom-bloom of May. O Lord, confirm my root, Train up my shoot, To live and give Harvest of wholesome fruit. Life that was born to die Sets heart on high, And counts and mounts Steep stages of the sky. Two things, Lord, I desire And I require; Love's name, and flame To wrap my soul in fire. Life that was born to love Sends heart above Both cloud and shroud, And broods a peaceful dove. Two things I ask of Thee; Deny not me; Eyesight and light Thy Blessed Face to see. “Perfect Love casteth out Fear.” Lord, give me blessed fear, And much more blessed love That fearing I may love Thee here And be Thy harmless dove: Until Thou cast out fear, Until Thou perfect love, Until Thou end mine exile here And fetch Thee home Thy dove. [Hope is the counterpoise of fear] Hope is the counterpoise of fear While night enthralls us here. Fear hath a startled eye that holds a tear: Hope hath an upward glance, for dawn draws near With sunshine and with cheer. Fear gazing earthwards spies a bier; And sets herself to rear A lamentable tomb where leaves drop sere, Bleaching to congruous skeletons austere: Hope chants a funeral hymn most sweet and clear, And seems true chanticleer Of resurrection and of all things dear In the oncoming endless year. Fear ballasts hope, hope buoys up fear, And both befit us here. “Subject to like Passions as we are.” Whoso hath anguish is not dead in sin, Whoso hath pangs of utterless desire. Like as in smouldering flax which harbours fire,— Red heat of conflagration may begin, Melt that hard heart, burn out the dross within, Permeate with glory the new man entire, Crown him with fire, mould for his hands a lyre Of fiery strings to sound with those who win. Anguish is anguish, yet potential bliss, Pangs of desire are birth-throes of delight; Those citizens felt such who walk in white, And meet, but no more sunder, with a kiss; Who fathom still unfathomed mysteries, And love, adore, rejoice, with all their might. [Experience bows a sweet contented face] Experience bows a sweet contented face, Still setting to her seal that God is true: Beneath the sun, she knows, is nothing new; All things that go return with measured pace, Winds, rivers, man's still recommencing race:— While Hope beyond earth's circle strains her view, Past sun and moon, and rain and rainbow too, Enamoured of unseen eternal grace. Experience saith, “My God doth all things well:” And for the morrow taketh little care, Such peace and patience garrison her soul:— While Hope, who never yet hath eyed the goal, With arms flung forth, and backward floating hair, Touches, embraces, hugs the invisible. “Charity never Faileth.” Such is Love, it comforts in extremity, Tho' a tempest rage around and rage above, Tempest beyond tempest, far as eye can see: Such is Love, That it simply heeds its mourning inward Dove; Dove which craves contented for a home to be Set amid the myrtles or an olive grove. Dove-eyed Love contemplates the Twelve-fruited Tree, Marks the bowing palms which worship as they move; Simply sayeth, simply prayeth, “All for me!” Such is Love. “The Greatest of these is Charity.” A moon impoverished amid stars curtailed, A sun of its exuberant lustre shorn, A transient morning that is scarcely morn, A lingering night in double dimness veiled.— Our hands are slackened and our strength has failed: We born to darkness, wherefore were we born? No ripening more for olive, grape, or corn: Faith faints, hope faints, even love himself has paled. Nay! love lifts up a face like any rose Flushing and sweet above a thorny stem, Softly protesting that the way he knows; And as for faith and hope, will carry them Safe to the gate of New Jerusalem, Where light shines full and where the palm-tree blows. [All beneath the sun hasteth] All beneath the sun hasteth, All that hath begun wasteth; Earth-notes change in tune With the changeful moon, Which waneth While earth's chant complaineth. Plumbs the deep, Fear descending; Scales the steep, Hope ascending; Faith betwixt the twain Plies both goad and rein, Half fearing, All hopeful, day is nearing. [If thou be dead, forgive and thou shalt live] If thou be dead, forgive and thou shalt live; If thou hast sinned, forgive and be forgiven; God waiteth to be gracious and forgive, And open heaven. Set not thy will to die and not to live; Set not thy face as flint refusing heaven; Thou fool, set not thy heart on hell: forgive And be forgiven. “Let Patience have her perfect work.” Can man rejoice who lives in hourly fear? Can man make haste who toils beneath a load? Can man feel rest who has no fixed abode? All he lays hold of, or can see or hear, Is passing by, is prompt to disappear, Is doomed, foredoomed, continueth in no stay: This day he breathes in is his latter day, This year of time is this world's latter year. Thus in himself is he most miserable: Out of himself, Lord, lift him up to Thee, Out of himself and all these worlds that flee; Hold him in patience underneath the rod, Anchor his hope beyond life's ebb and swell, Perfect his patience in the love of God. [Patience must dwell with Love, for Love and Sorrow] Patience must dwell with Love, for Love and Sorrow Have pitched their tent together here: Love all alone will build a house tomorrow, And sorrow not be near. Today for Love's sake hope, still hope, in sorrow, Rest in her shade and hold her dear: Today she nurses thee; and lo! tomorrow Love only will be near. “Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.” All that we see rejoices in the sunshine, All that we hear makes merry in the Spring: God grant us such a mind to be glad after our kind, And to sing His praises for everything. Much that we see must vanish with the sunshine, Sweet Spring must fail, and fail the choir of Spring: But Wisdom shall burn on when the lesser lights are gone, And shall sing God's praises evermore for everything. [What is the beginning? Love. What the course? Love still.] What is the beginning? Love. What the course? Love still. What the goal? The goal is Love on the happy hill. Is there nothing then but Love, search we sky or earth? There is nothing out of Love hath perpetual worth: All things flag but only Love, all things fail or flee; There is nothing left but Love worthy you and me. [Lord, make me pure] Lord, make me pure: Only the pure shall see Thee as Thou art And shall endure. Lord, bring me low; For Thou wert lowly in Thy blessed heart: Lord, keep me so. [Love, to be love, must walk Thy way] Love, to be love, must walk Thy way And work Thy Will; Or if Thou say, “Lie still,” Lie still and pray. Love, Thine own Bride, with all her might Will follow Thee, And till the shadows flee Keep Thee in sight. Love will not mar her peaceful face With cares undue, Faithless and hopeless too And out of place. Love, knowing Thou much more art Love, Will sun her grief, And pluck her myrtle-leaf, And be Thy dove. Love here hath vast beatitude: What shall be hers Where there is no more curse, But all is good? [Lord, I am feeble and of mean account] Lord, I am feeble and of mean account: Thou Who dost condescend as well as mount, Stoop Thou Thyself to me And grant me grace to hear and grace to see. Lord, if Thou grant me grace to hear and see Thy very Self Who stoopest thus to me, I make but slight account Of aught beside wherein to sink or mount. [Tune me, O Lord, into one harmony] Tune me, O Lord, into one harmony With Thee, one full responsive vibrant chord; Unto Thy praise all love and melody, Tune me, O Lord. Thus need I flee nor death, nor fire, nor sword: A little while these be, then cease to be, And sent by Thee not these should be abhorred. Devil and world, gird me with strength to flee, To flee the flesh, and arm me with Thy word: As Thy Heart is to my heart, unto Thee Tune me, O Lord. “They shall be as white as snow.” Whiteness most white. Ah, to be clean again In mine own sight and God's most holy sight! To reach thro' any flood or fire of pain Whiteness most white: To learn to hate the wrong and love the right Even while I walk thro' shadows that are vain, Descending thro' vain shadows into night. Lord, not today: yet some day bliss for bane Give me, for mortal frailty give me might, Give innocence for guilt, and for my stain Whiteness most white. [Thy lilies drink the dew] Thy lilies drink the dew, Thy lambs the rill, and I will drink them too; For those in purity And innocence are types, dear Lord, of Thee. The fragrant lily flower Bows and fulfils Thy Will its lifelong hour; The lamb at rest and play Fulfils Thy Will in gladness all the day; They leave tomorrow's cares Until the morrow, what it brings it bears. And I, Lord, would be such; Not high or great or anxious overmuch, But pure and temperate, Earnest to do Thy Will betimes and late, Fragrant with love and praise And innocence thro' all my appointed days; Thy lily I would be, Spotless and sweet, Thy lamb to follow Thee. “When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord.” A burdened heart that bleeds and bears And hopes and waits in pain, And faints beneath its fears and cares, Yet hopes again: Wilt Thou accept the heart I bring, O gracious Lord and kind, To ease it of a torturing sting, And staunch and bind? Alas, if Thou wilt none of this, None else have I to give: Look Thou upon it as it is, Accept, relieve. Or if Thou wilt not yet relieve, Be not extreme to sift: Accept a faltering will to give, Itself Thy gift. [Grant us such grace that we may work Thy Will] Grant us such grace that we may work Thy Will And speak Thy words and walk before Thy Face, Profound and calm, like waters deep and still: Grant us such grace. Not hastening and not loitering in our pace For gloomiest valley or for sultriest hill, Content and fearless on our downward race. As rivers seek a sea they cannot fill But are themselves filled full in its embrace, Absorbed, at rest, each river and each rill: Grant us such grace. “Who hath despised the day of small things?” As violets so be I recluse and sweet, Cheerful as daisies unaccounted rare, Still sunward-gazing from a lowly seat, Still sweetening wintry air. While half-awakened Spring lags incomplete, While lofty forest trees tower bleak and bare, Daisies and violets own remotest heat And bloom and make them fair. “Do this, and he doeth it.” Content to come, content to go, Content to wrestle or to race, Content to know or not to know, Each in his place; Lord, grant us grace to love Thee so That glad of heart and glad of face At last we may sit, high or low, Each in his place; Where pleasures flow as rivers flow, And loss has left no barren trace, And all that are, are perfect so, Each in his place. “That no man take thy Crown.” Be faithful unto death. Christ proffers thee Crown of a life that draws immortal breath: To thee He saith, yea, and He saith to me, “Be faithful unto death.” To every living soul that same He saith, “Be faithful”:—whatsoever else we be, Let us be faithful, challenging His faith. Tho' trouble storm around us like the sea, Tho' hell surge up to scare us and to scathe, Tho' heaven and earth betake themselves to flee, “Be faithful unto death.” “Ye are come unto Mount Sion.” Fear, Faith, and Hope have sent their hearts above: Prudence, Obedience, and Humility Climb at their call, all scaling heaven toward Love. Fear hath least grace but great expediency; Faith and Humility show grave and strong; Prudence and Hope mount balanced equally. Obedience marches marshalling their throng, Goes first, goes last, to left hand or to right; And all the six uplift a pilgrim's song. By day they rest not, nor they rest by night: While Love within them, with them, over them, Weans them and woos them from the dark to light. Each plies for staff not reed with broken stem, But olive branch in pledge of patient peace; Till Love being theirs in New Jerusalem, Transfigure them to Love, and so they cease. Love is the sole beatitude above: All other graces, to their vast increase Of glory, look on Love and mirror Love. “Sit down in the lowest room.” Lord, give me grace To take the lowest place; Nor even desire, Unless it be Thy Will, to go up higher. Except by grace, I fail of lowest place; Except desire Sit low, it aims awry to go up higher. “Lord, it is good for us to be here.” Grant us, O Lord, that patience and that faith: Faith's patience imperturbable in Thee, Hope's patience till the long-drawn shadows flee, Love's patience unresentful of all scathe. Verily we need patience breath by breath; Patience while faith holds up her glass to see, While hope toils yoked in fear's copartnery, And love goes softly on the way to death. How gracious and how perfecting a grace Must patience be on which those others wait: Faith with suspended rapture in her face, Hope pale and careful hand in hand with fear, Love—ah, good love who would not antedate God's Will, but saith, Good is it to be here. [Lord, grant us grace to rest upon Thy word] Lord, grant us grace to rest upon Thy word, To rest in hope until we see Thy Face; To rest thro' toil unruffled and unstirred, Lord, grant us grace. This burden and this heat wear on apace: Night comes, when sweeter than night's singing bird Will swell the silence of our ended race. Ah, songs which flesh and blood have never heard And cannot hear, songs of the silent place Where rest remains! Lord, slake our hope deferred, Lord, grant us grace. THE WORLD. SELF-DESTRUCTION. “A vain Shadow.” The world,—what a world, ah me! Mouldy, worm-eaten, grey: Vain as a leaf from a tree, As a fading day, As veriest vanity, As the froth and the spray Of the hollow-billowed sea, As what was and shall not be, As what is and passes away. “Lord, save us, we perish.” O Lord, seek us, O Lord, find us In Thy patient care; Be Thy Love before, behind us, Round us, everywhere: Lest the god of this world blind us, Lest he speak us fair, Lest he forge a chain to bind us, Lest he bait a snare. Turn not from us, call to mind us, Find, embrace us, bear; Be Thy Love before, behind us, Round us, everywhere. [What is this above thy head] What is this above thy head, O Man?— The World, all overspread With pearls and golden rays And gems ablaze; A sight which day and night Fills an eye's span. What is this beneath thy feet, O Saint?— The World, a nauseous sweet Puffed up and perishing; A hollow thing, A lie, a vanity, Tinsel and paint. What is she while time is time, O Man?— In a perpetual prime Beauty and youth she hath; And her footpath Breeds flowers thro' dancing hours Since time began. While time lengthens what is she, O Saint?— Nought: yea, all men shall see How she is nought at all, When her death-pall Of fire ends their desire And brands her taint. Ah, poor Man, befooled and slow And faint! Ah, poorest Man, if so Thou turn thy back on bliss And choose amiss! For thou art choosing now: Sinner,—or Saint. Babylon the Great. Foul is she and ill-favoured, set askew: Gaze not upon her till thou dream her fair, Lest she should mesh thee in her wanton hair, Adept in arts grown old yet ever new. Her heart lusts not for love, but thro' and thro' For blood, as spotted panther lusts in lair; No wine is in her cup, but filth is there Unutterable, with plagues hid out of view. Gaze not upon her, for her dancing whirl Turns giddy the fixed gazer presently: Gaze not upon her, lest thou be as she When, at the far end of her long desire, Her scarlet vest and gold and gem and pearl And she amid her pomp are set on fire. “Standing afar off for the fear of her torment.” Is this the end? is there no end but this? Yea, none beside: No other end for pride And foulness and besottedness. Hath she no friend? hath she no clinging friend? Nay, none at all; Who stare upon her fall Quake for themselves with hair on end. Will she be done away? vanish away? Yea, like a dream; Yea, like the shades that seem Somewhat, and lo! are nought by day. Alas for her amid man's helpless moan, Alas for her! She hath no comforter: In solitude of fire she sits alone. “O Lucifer, Son of the Morning!” Of fallen star! a darkened light, A glory hurtled from its car, Self-blasted from the holy height: Oh fallen star! Fallen beyond earth's utmost bar, Beyond return, beyond far sight Of outmost glimmering nebular. Now blackness, which once walked in white; Now death, whose life once glowed afar; Oh son of dawn that loved the night, Oh fallen star! [Alas, alas! for the self-destroyed] Alas, alas! for the self-destroyed Vanish as images from a glass, Sink down and die down by hope unbuoyed:— Alas, alas! Who shall stay their ruinous mass? Besotted, reckless, possessed, decoyed, They hurry to the dolorous pass. Saints fall a-weeping who would have joyed, Sore they weep for a glory that was, For a fulness emptied into the void, Alas, alas! [As froth on the face of the deep] As froth on the face of the deep, As foam on the crest of the sea, As dreams at the waking of sleep, As gourd of a day and a night, As harvest that no man shall reap, As vintage that never shall be, Is hope if it cling not aright, O my God, unto Thee. “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” In tempest and storm blackness of darkness for ever, A fire unextinguished, a worm's indestructible swarm; Where no hope shall ever be more, and love shall be never, In tempest and storm; Where the form of all things is fashionless, void of all form; Where from death that severeth all, the soul cannot sever In tempest and storm. [Toll, bell, toll. For hope is flying] Toll, bell, toll. For hope is flying Sighing from the earthbound soul: Life is sighing, life is dying: Toll, bell, toll. Gropes in its own grave the mole Wedding darkness, undescrying, Tending to no different goal. Self-slain soul, in vain thy sighing: Self-slain, who should make thee whole? Vain the clamour of thy crying: Toll, bell, toll. DIVERS WORLDS. TIME AND ETERNITY. [Earth has clear call of daily bells] Earth has clear call of daily bells, A chancel-vault of gloom and star, A rapture where the anthems are, A thunder when the organ swells: Alas, man's daily life—what else?— Is out of tune with daily bells. While Paradise accords the chimes Of Earth and Heaven, its patient pause Is rest fulfilling music's laws. Saints sit and gaze, where oftentimes Precursive flush of morning climbs And air vibrates with coming chimes. “Escape to the Mountain.” I peered within, and saw a world of sin; Upward, and saw a world of righteousness; Downward, and saw darkness and flame begin Which no man can express. I girt me up, I gat me up to flee From face of darkness and devouring flame: And fled I had, but guilt is loading me With dust of death and shame. Yet still the light of righteousness beams pure, Beams to me from the world of far-off day:— Lord, Who hast called them happy that endure, Lord, make me such as they. [I lift mine eyes to see: earth vanisheth.] I lift mine eyes to see: earth vanisheth. I lift up wistful eyes and bend my knee: Trembling, bowed down, and face to face with Death, I lift mine eyes to see. Lo, what I see is Death that shadows me: Yet whilst I, seeing, draw a shuddering breath, Death like a mist grows rare perceptibly. Beyond the darkness light, beyond the scathe Healing, beyond the Cross a palm-branch tree, Beyond Death Life, on evidence of faith: I lift mine eyes to see. “Yet a little while.” Heaven is not far, tho' far the sky Overarching earth and main. It takes not long to live and die, Die, revive, and rise again. Not long: how long? Oh, long re-echoing song! O Lord, how long? “Behold, it was very good.” All things are fair, if we had eyes to see How first God made them goodly everywhere: And goodly still in Paradise they be,— All things are fair. O Lord, the solemn heavens Thy praise declare; The multi-fashioned saints bring praise to Thee, As doves fly home and cast away their care. As doves on divers branches of their tree, Perched high or low, sit all contented there Not mourning any more; in each degree All things are fair. “Whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.” When all the overwork of life Is finished once, and fallen asleep We shrink no more beneath the knife, But having sown prepare to reap; Delivered from the crossway rough, Delivered from the thorny scourge, Delivered from the tossing surge, Then shall we find—(please God!)—it is enough? Not in this world of hope deferred, This world of perishable stuff; Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, Nor heart conceived that full “enough”: Here moans the separating sea, Here harvests fail, here breaks the heart; There God shall join and no man part, All one in Christ, so one—(please God!)—with me. [This near-at-hand land breeds pain by measure] This near-at-hand land breeds pain by measure: That far-away land overflows with treasure Of heaped-up good pleasure. Our land that we see is befouled by evil: The land that we see not makes mirth and revel, Far from death and devil. This land hath for music sobbing and sighing: That land hath soft speech and sweet soft replying Of all loves undying. This land hath for pastime errors and follies: That land hath unending unflagging solace Of full-chanted “Holies.” Up and away, call the Angels to us; Come to our home where no foes pursue us, And no tears bedew us; Where that which riseth sets again never, Where that which springeth flows in a river For ever and ever; Where harvest justifies labour of sowing, Where that which budded comes to the blowing Sweet beyond your knowing. Come and laugh with us, sing in our singing; Come, yearn no more, but rest in your clinging. See what we are bringing; Crowns like our own crowns, robes for your wearing; For love of you we kiss them in bearing, All good with you sharing: Over you gladdening, in you delighting; Come from your famine, your failure, your fighting; Come to full wrong-righting. Come, where all balm is garnered to ease you; Come, where all beauty is spread out to please you; Come, gaze upon Jesu. “Was Thy Wrath against the Sea?” The sea laments with unappeasable Hankering wail of loss, Lifting its hands on high and passing by Out of the lovely light: No foambow any more may crest that swell Of clamorous waves which toss; Lifting its hands on high it passes by From light into the night. Peace, peace, thou sea! God's wisdom worketh well, Assigns it crown or cross: Lift we all hands on high, and passing by Attest: God doeth right. “And there was no more Sea.” Voices from above and from beneath, Voices of creation near and far, Voices out of life and out of death, Out of measureless space, Sun, moon, star, In oneness of contentment offering praise. Heaven and earth and sea jubilant, Jubilant all things that dwell therein; Filled to fullest overflow they chant, Still roll onward, swell, Still begin, Never flagging praise interminable. Thou who must fall silent in a while, Chant thy sweetest, gladdest, best, at once; Sun thyself today, keep peace and smile; By love upward send Orisons, Accounting love thy lot and love thine end. [Roses on a brier] Roses on a brier, Pearls from out the bitter sea, Such is earth's desire However pure it be. Neither bud nor brier, Neither pearl nor brine for me: Be stilled, my long desire; There shall be no more sea. Be stilled, my passionate heart; Old earth shall end, new earth shall be: Be still, and earn thy part Where shall be no more sea. [We are those who tremble at Thy word] We are those who tremble at Thy word; Who faltering walk in darkness toward our close Of mortal life, by terrors curbed and spurred: We are of those. We journey to that land which no man knows Who any more can make his voice be heard Above the clamour of our wants and woes. Not ours the hearts Thy loftiest love hath stirred, Not such as we Thy lily and Thy rose:— Yet, Hope of those who hope with hope deferred, We are of those. “Awake, thou that sleepest.” The night is far spent, the day is at hand: Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, And let us put on the armour of light. Night for the dead in their stiffness and starkness! Day for the living who mount in their might Out of their graves to the beautiful land. Far, far away lies the beautiful land: Mount on wide wings of exceeding desire, Mount, look not back, mount to life and to light, Mount by the gleam of your lamps all on fire Up from the dead men and up from the night. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. [We know not when, we know not where] We know not when, we know not where, We know not what that world will be; But this we know: it will be fair To see. With heart athirst and thirsty face We know and know not what shall be: Christ Jesus bring us of His grace To see. Christ Jesus bring us of His grace, Beyond all prayers our hope can pray, One day to see Him face to Face, One day. “I will lift up mine eyes unto the Hills.” When sick of life and all the world— How sick of all desire but Thee!— I lift mine eyes up to the hills, Eyes of my heart that see, I see beyond all death and ills Refreshing green for heart and eyes, The golden streets and gateways pearled, The trees of Paradise. “There is a time for all things,” saith The Word of Truth, Thyself the Word; And many things Thou reasonest of: A time for hope deferred, But time is now for grief and fears; A time for life, but now is death; Oh, when shall be the time of love When Thou shalt wipe our tears? Then the new Heavens and Earth shall be Where righteousness shall dwell indeed; There shall be no more blight, nor need, Nor barrier of the sea; No sun and moon alternating, For God shall be the Light thereof; No sorrow more, no death, no sting, For God Who reigns is Love. “Then whose shall those things be?” Oh what is earth, that we should build Our houses here, and seek concealed Poor treasure, and add field to field, And heap to heap, and store to store, Still grasping more and seeking more, While step by step Death nears the door? “His Banner over me was Love.” In that world we weary to attain, Love's furled banner floats at large unfurled: There is no more doubt and no more pain In that world. There are gems and gold and inlets pearled; There the verdure fadeth not again; There no clinging tendrils droop uncurled. Here incessant tides stir up the main, Stormy miry depths aloft are hurled: There is no more sea, or storm, or stain, In that world. [Beloved, yield thy time to God, for He] Beloved, yield thy time to God, for He Will make eternity thy recompense; Give all thy substance for His Love, and be Beatified past earth's experience. Serve Him in bonds, until He set thee free; Serve Him in dust, until He lift thee thence; Till death be swallowed up in victory When the great trumpet sounds to bid thee hence. Shall setting day win day that will not set? Poor price wert thou to spend thyself for Christ, Had not His wealth thy poverty sufficed: Yet since He makes His garden of thy clod, Water thy lily, rose, or violet, And offer up thy sweetness unto God. [Time seems not short] Time seems not short: If so I call to mind Its vast prerogative to loose or bind, And bear and strike amort All humankind. Time seems not long: If I peer out and see Sphere within sphere, time in eternity, And hear the alternate song Cry endlessly. Time greatly short, O time so briefly long, Yea, time sole battle-ground of right and wrong: Art thou a time for sport And for a song? [The half moon shows a face of plaintive sweetness] The half moon shows a face of plaintive sweetness Ready and poised to wax or wane; A fire of pale desire in incompleteness, Tending to pleasure or to pain:— Lo, while we gaze she rolleth on in fleetness To perfect loss or perfect gain. Half bitterness we know, we know half sweetness; This world is all on wax, on wane: When shall completeness round time's incompleteness, Fulfilling joy, fulfilling pain?— Lo, while we ask, life rolleth on in fleetness To finished loss or finished gain. “As the Doves to their windows.” They throng from the east and the west, The north and the south, with a song; To golden abodes of their rest They throng. Eternity stretches out long: Time, brief at its worst or its best, Will quit them of ruin and wrong. A rainbow aloft for their crest, A palm for their weakness made strong! As doves breast all winds to their nest, They throng. [Oh knell of a passing time] Oh knell of a passing time, Will it never cease to chime? Oh stir of the tedious sea, Will it never cease to be? Yea, when night and when day, Moon and sun, pass away. Surely the sun burns low, The moon makes ready to go, Broad ocean ripples to waste, Time is running in haste, Night is numbered, and day Numbered to pass away. [Time passeth away with its pleasure and pain] Time passeth away with its pleasure and pain, Its garlands of cypress and bay, With wealth and with want, with a balm and a bane, Time passeth away. Eternity cometh to stay, Eternity stayeth to go not again; Eternity barring the way, Arresting all courses of planet or main, Arresting who plan or who pray, Arresting creation: while grand in its wane Time passeth away. “The Earth shall tremble at the Look of Him.” Tremble, thou earth, at the Presence of the Lord Whose Will conceived thee and brought thee to the birth, Always, everywhere, thy Lord to be adored: Tremble, thou earth. Wilt thou laugh time away in music and mirth? Time hath days of pestilence, hath days of a sword, Hath days of hunger and thirst in desolate dearth. Till eternity wake up the multicord Thrilled harp of heaven, and breathe full its organ's girth For joy of heaven and infinite reward, Tremble, thou earth. [Time lengthening, in the lengthening seemeth long] Time lengthening, in the lengthening seemeth long: But ended Time will seem a little space, A little while from morn to evensong, A little while that ran a rapid race; A little while, when once Eternity Denies proportion to the other's pace. Eternity to be and be and be, Ever beginning, never ending still, Still undiminished far as thought can see; Farther than thought can see, by dint of will Strung up and strained and shooting like a star Past utmost bound of everlasting hill: Eternity unswaddled, without bar, Finishing sequence in its awful sum; Eternity still rolling forth its car, Eternity still here and still to come. “All Flesh is Grass.” So brief a life, and then an endless life Or endless death; So brief a life, then endless peace or strife: Whoso considereth How man but like a flower Or shoot of grass Blooms an hour, Well may sigh “Alas!” So brief a life, and then an endless grief Or endless joy; So brief a life, then ruin or relief: What solace, what annoy Of Time needs dwelling on? It is, it was, It is done, While we sigh “Alas!” Yet saints are singing in a happy hope Forecasting pleasure, Bright eyes of faith enlarging all their scope; Saints love beyond Time's measure: Where love is, there is bliss That will not pass; Where love is, Dies away “Alas!” [Heaven's chimes are slow, but sure to strike at last] Heaven's chimes are slow, but sure to strike at last: Earth's sands are slow, but surely dropping thro': And much we have to suffer, much to do, Before the time be past. Chimes that keep time are neither slow nor fast: Not many are the numbered sands nor few: A time to suffer, and a time to do, And then the time is past. “There remaineth therefore a Rest to the People of God.” Rest remains when all is done, Work and vigil, prayer and fast, All fulfilled from first to last, All the length of time gone past And eternity begun! Fear and hope and chastening rod Urge us on the narrow way: Bear we now as best we may Heat and burden of today, Struggling, panting up to God. [Parting after parting] Parting after parting, Sore loss and gnawing pain: Meeting grows half a sorrow Because of parting again. When shall the day break That these things shall not be? When shall new earth be ours Without a sea, And time that is not time But eternity? To meet, worth living for; Worth dying for, to meet; To meet, worth parting for, Bitter forgot in sweet: To meet, worth parting before Never to part more. “They put their trust in Thee, and were not confounded.” I. Together once, but never more While Time and Death run out their runs: Tho' sundered now as shore from shore, Together once. Nor rising suns, nor setting suns, Nor life renewed which springtide bore, Make one again Death's sundered ones. Eternity holds rest in store, Holds hope of long reunions: But holds it what they hungered for Together once? II. Whatso it be, howso it be, Amen. Blessed it is, believing, not to see. Now God knows all that is; and we shall, then, Whatso it be. God's Will is best for man whose will is free. God's Will is better to us, yea, than ten Desires whereof He holds and weighs the key. Amid her household cares He guides the wren, He guards the shifty mouse from poverty; He knows all wants, allots each where and when, Whatso it be. [Short is time, and only time is bleak] Short is time, and only time is bleak; Gauge the exceeding height thou hast to climb: Long eternity is nigh to seek: Short is time. Time is shortening with the wintry rime: Pray and watch and pray, girt up and meek; Praying, watching, praying, chime by chime. Pray by silence if thou canst not speak: Time is shortening; pray on till the prime: Time is shortening; soul, fulfil thy week: Short is time. For Each. My harvest is done, its promise is ended, Weak and watery sets the sun, Day and night in one mist are blended, My harvest is done. Long while running, how short when run, Time to eternity has descended, Timeless eternity has begun. Was it the narrow way that I wended? Snares and pits was it mine to shun? The scythe has fallen, so long suspended, My harvest is done. For All. Man's harvest is past, his summer is ended, Hope and fear are finished at last, Day hath descended, night hath ascended, Man's harvest is past. Time is fled that fleeted so fast: All the unmended remains unmended, The perfect, perfect: all lots are cast. Waiting till earth and ocean be rended, Waiting for call of the trumpet blast, Each soul at goal of that way it wended,— Man's harvest is past. NEW JERUSALEM AND ITS CITIZENS. “The Holy City, New Jerusalem.” Jerusalem is built of gold, Of crystal, pearl, and gem: Oh fair thy lustres manifold, Thou fair Jerusalem! Thy citizens who walk in white Have nought to do with day or night, And drink the river of delight. Jerusalem makes melody For simple joy of heart; An organ of full compass she, One-tuned thro' every part: While not to day or night belong Her matins and her evensong, The one thanksgiving of her throng. Jerusalem a garden is, A garden of delight; Leaf, flower, and fruit make fair her trees, Which see not day or night: Beside her River clear and calm The Tree of Life grows with the Palm, For triumph and for food and balm. Jerusalem, where song nor gem Nor fruit nor waters cease, God bring us to Jerusalem, God bring us home in peace; The strong who stand, the weak who fall, The first and last, the great and small, Home one by one, home one and all. [When wickedness is broken as a tree] When wickedness is broken as a tree Paradise comes to light, ah holy land! Whence death has vanished like a shifting sand, And barrenness is banished with the sea. Its bulwarks are salvation fully manned, All gems it hath for glad variety, And pearls for pureness radiant glimmeringly, And gold for grandeur where all good is grand. An inner ring of saints meets linked above, And linked of angels is an outer ring; For voice of waters or for thunders' voice Lo! harps and songs wherewith all saints rejoice, And all the trembling there of any string Is but a trembling of enraptured love. [Jerusalem of fire] Jerusalem of fire And gold and pearl and gem, Saints flock to fill thy choir, Jerusalem. Lo, thrones thou hast for them; Desirous they desire Thy harp, thy diadem, Thy bridal white attire, A palm-branch from thy stem: Thy holiness their hire, Jerusalem. “She shall be brought unto the King.” The King's Daughter is all glorious within, Her clothing of wrought gold sets forth her bliss; Where the endless choruses of heaven begin The King's Daughter is; Perfect her notes in the perfect harmonies; With tears wiped away, no conscience of sin, Loss forgotten and sorrowful memories; Alight with Cherubin, afire with Seraphin, Lily for pureness, rose for charities, With joy won and with joy evermore to win, The King's Daughter is. [Who is this that cometh up not alone] Who is this that cometh up not alone From the fiery-flying-serpent wilderness, Leaning upon her own Beloved One: Who is this: Lo, the King of king's daughter, a high princess, Going home as bride to her Husband's Throne, Virgin queen in perfected loveliness. Her eyes a dove's eyes and her voice a dove's moan, She shows like a full moon for heavenliness: Eager saints and angels ask in heaven's zone, Who is this? [Who sits with the King in His Throne? Not a slave but a Bride] Who sits with the King in His Throne? Not a slave but a Bride, With this King of all Greatness and Grace Who reigns not alone; His Glory her glory, where glorious she glows at His side Who sits with the King in His Throne. She came from dim uttermost depths which no Angel hath known, Leviathan's whirlpool and Dragon's dominion worldwide, From the frost or the fire to Paradisiacal zone. Lo, she is fair as a dove, silvery, golden, dove-eyed: Lo, Dragon laments and Death laments, for their prey is flown: She dwells in the Vision of Peace, and her peace shall abide Who sits with the King in His Throne. Antipas. Hidden from the darkness of our mortal sight, Hidden in the Paradise of lovely light, Hidden in God's Presence, worshipped face to face, Hidden in the sanctuary of Christ's embrace. Up, O Wills! to track him home among the bless'd; Up, O Hearts! to know him in the joy of rest; Where no darkness more shall hide him from our sight, Where we shall be love with love, and light with light, Worshipping our God together face to face, Wishless in the sanctuary of Christ's embrace. “Beautiful for situation.” A lovely city in a lovely land, Whose citizens are lovely, and whose King Is Very Love; to Whom all Angels sing; To Whom all saints sing crowned, their sacred band Saluting Love with palm-branch in their hand: Thither all doves on gold or silver wing Flock home thro' agate windows glistering Set wide, and where pearl gates wide open stand. A bower of roses is not half so sweet, A cave of diamonds doth not glitter so, Nor Lebanon is fruitful set thereby: And thither thou, beloved, and thither I May set our heart and set our face and go, Faint yet pursuing, home on tireless feet. [Lord, by what inconceivable dim road] Lord, by what inconceivable dim road Thou leadest man on footsore pilgrimage! Weariness is his rest from stage to stage, Brief halting-places are his sole abode. Onward he fares thro' rivers overflowed, Thro' deserts where all doleful creatures rage; Onward from year to year, from age to age, He groans and totters onward with his load. Behold how inconceivable his way; How tenfold inconceivable the goal, His goal of hope deferred, his promised peace: Yea, but behold him sitting down at ease, Refreshed in body and refreshed in soul, At rest from labour on the Sabbath Day. “As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.” “Golden haired, lily white, Will you pluck me lilies? Or will you show me where they grow, Show where the limpid rill is? But is your hair of gold or light, And is your foot of flake or fire, And have you wings rolled up from sight And songs to slake desire?” “I pluck fresh flowers of Paradise, Lilies and roses red, A bending sceptre for my hand, A crown to crown my head. I sing my songs, I pluck my flowers Sweet-scented from their fragrant trees; I sing, we sing, amid the bowers And gather palm-branches.” “Is there a path to Heaven My stumbling foot may tread? And will you show that way to go, That bower and blossom bed?” “The path to Heaven is steep and straight And scorched, but ends in shade of trees, Where yet a while we sing and wait And gather palm-branches.” [Cast down but not destroyed, chastened not slain] Cast down but not destroyed, chastened not slain: Thy Saints have lived that life, but how can I? I, who thro' dread of death do daily die By daily foretaste of an unfelt pain. Lo, I depart who shall not come again; Lo, as a shadow I am flitting by; As a leaf trembling, as a wheel I fly, While death flies faster and my flight is vain. Chastened not slain, cast down but not destroyed:— If thus Thy Saints have struggled home to peace, Why should not I take heart to be as they? They too pent passions in a house of clay, Fear and desire, and pangs and ecstasies; Yea, thus they joyed who now are overjoyed. [Lift up thine eyes to seek the invisible] Lift up thine eyes to seek the invisible: Stir up thy heart to choose the still unseen: Strain up thy hope in glad perpetual green To scale the exceeding height where all saints dwell. —Saints, it is well with you?—Yea, it is well.— Where they have reaped, by faith kneel thou to glean: Because they stooped so low to reap, they lean Now over golden harps unspeakable. —But thou purblind and deafened, knowest thou Those glorious beauties unexperienced By ear or eye or by heart hitherto?— I know Whom I have trusted: wherefore now All amiable, accessible tho' fenced, Golden Jerusalem floats full in view. “Love is strong as Death.” As flames that consume the mountains, as winds that coerce the sea, Thy men of renown show forth Thy might in the clutch of death: Down they go into silence, yet the Trump of the Jubilee Swells not Thy praise as swells it the breathless pause of their breath. What is the flame of their fire, if so I may catch the flame; What the strength of their strength, if also I may wax strong? The flaming fire of their strength is the love of Jesu's Name, In Whom their death is life, their silence utters a song. “Let them rejoice in their beds.” Crimson as the rubies, crimson as the roses, Crimson as the sinking sun, Singing on his crimsoned bed each saint reposes, Fought his fight, his battle won; Till the rosy east the day of days discloses, All his work, save waiting, done. Far above the stars, while underneath the daisies, Resting, for his race is run, Unto Thee his heart each quiet saint upraises, God the Father, Spirit, Son; Unto Thee his heart, unto Thee his praises, O Lord God, the Three in One. [Slain in their high places: fallen on rest] Slain in their high places: fallen on rest Where the eternal peace lights up their faces, In God's sacred acre breast to breast:— Slain in their high places. From all tribes, all families, all races, Gathered home together; east or west Sending home its tale of gifts and graces. Twine, oh twine, heaven's amaranth for their crest, Raise their praise while home their triumph paces; Kings by their own King of kings confessed, Slain in their high places. “What hath God wrought!” The shout of a King is among them. One day may I be Of that perfect communion of lovers contented and free In the land that is very far off, and far off from the sea. The shout of the King is among them. One King and one song, One thunder of manifold voices harmonious and strong, One King and one love, and one shout of one worshipping throng. “Before the Throne, and before the Lamb.” As the voice of many waters all saints sing as one, As the voice of an unclouded thundering; Unswayed by the changing moon and unswayed by the sun, As the voice of many waters all saints sing. Circling round the rainbow of their perfect ring, Twelve thousand times twelve thousand voices in unison Swell the triumph, swell the praise of Christ the King. Where raiment is white of blood-steeped linen slowly spun, Where crowns are golden of Love's own largessing, Where eternally the ecstasy is but begun, As the voice of many waters all saints sing. “He shall go no more out.” Once within, within for evermore: There the long beatitudes begin: Overflows the still unwasting store, Once within. Left without are death and doubt and sin; All man wrestled with and all he bore, Man who saved his life, skin after skin. Blow the trumpet-blast unheard before, Shout the unheard-of shout for these who win, These, who cast their crowns on Heaven's high floor Once within. [Yea, blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection!] Yea, blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection! We mark well his bulwarks, we set up his tokens, we gaze, even we, On this lustre of God and of Christ, this creature of flawless perfection: Yea, blessed and holy is he. But what? an offscouring of earth, a wreck from the turbulent sea, A bloodstone unflinchingly hewn for the Temple's eternal erection, One scattered and peeled, one sifted and chastened and scourged and set free? Yea, this is that worshipful stone of the Wise Master Builder's election, Yea, this is that King and that Priest where all Hallows bow down the knee, Yea, this man set nigh to the Throne is Jonathan of David's delection, Yea, blessed and holy is he. [The joy of Saints, like incense turned to fire] The joy of Saints, like incense turned to fire In golden censers, soars acceptable; And high their heavenly hallelujahs swell Desirous still with still-fulfilled desire. Sweet thrill the harpstrings of the heavenly choir, Most sweet their voice while love is all they tell; Where love is all in all, and all is well Because their work is love and love their hire. All robed in white and all with palm in hand, Crowns too they have of gold and thrones of gold; The street is golden which their feet have trod, Or on a sea of glass and fire they stand: And none of them is young, and none is old, Except as perfect by the Will of God. [What are these lovely ones, yea, what are these?] What are these lovely ones, yea, what are these? Lo, these are they who for pure love of Christ Stripped off the trammels of soft silken ease, Beggaring themselves betimes, to be sufficed Throughout heaven's one eternal day of peace: By golden streets, thro' gates of pearl unpriced, They entered on the joys that will not cease, And found again all firstfruits sacrificed. And wherefore have you harps, and wherefore palms, And wherefore crowns, O ye who walk in white? Because our happy hearts are chanting psalms, Endless Te Deum for the ended fight; While thro' the everlasting lapse of calms We cast our crowns before the Lamb our Might. “The General Assembly and Church of the Firstborn.” Bring me to see, Lord, bring me yet to see Those nations of Thy glory and Thy grace Who splendid in Thy splendour worship Thee. Light in all eyes, content in every face, Raptures and voices one while manifold, Love and are well-beloved the ransomed race:— Great mitred priests, great kings in crowns of gold, Patriarchs who head the army of their sons, Matrons and mothers by their own extolled, Wise and most harmless holy little ones, Virgins who, making merry, lead the dance, Full-breathed victorious racers from all runs, Home-comers out of every change and chance, Hermits restored to social neighbourhood, Aspects which reproduce One Countenance, Life-losers with their losses all made good, All blessed hungry and athirst sufficed, All who bore crosses round the Holy Rood, Friends, brethren, sisters, of Lord Jesus Christ. “Every one that is perfect shall be as his master.” How can one man, how can all men, How can we be like St. Paul, Like St. John, or like St. Peter, Like the least of all Blessed Saints? for we are small. Love can make us like St. Peter, Love can make us like St. Paul, Love can make us like the blessed Bosom friend of all, Great St. John, tho' we are small. Love which clings and trusts and worships, Love which rises from a fall, Love which, prompting glad obedience, Labours most of all, Love makes great the great and small. [“As dying, and behold we live!”] “As dying, and behold we live!” So live the Saints while time is flying; Make all they make, give all they give, As dying; Bear all they bear without replying; They grieve as tho' they did not grieve, Uplifting praise with prayer and sighing. Patient thro' life's long-drawn reprieve, Aloof from strife, at peace from crying, The morrow to its day they leave, As dying. “So great a cloud of Witnesses.” I think of the saints I have known, and lift up mine eyes To the far-away home of beautiful Paradise, Where the song of saints gives voice to an undividing sea On whose plain their feet stand firm while they keep their jubilee. As the sound of waters their voice, as the sound of thunderings, While they all at once rejoice, while all sing and while each one sings; Where more saints flock in, and more, and yet more, and again yet more, And not one turns back to depart thro' the open entrance-door. O sights of our lovely earth, O sound of our earthly sea, Speak to me of Paradise, of all blessed saints to me: Or keep silence touching them, and speak to my heart alone Of the Saint of saints, the King of kings, the Lamb on the Throne. [Our Mothers, lovely women pitiful] Our Mothers, lovely women pitiful; Our Sisters, gracious in their life and death; To us each unforgotten memory saith: “Learn as we learned in life's sufficient school, Work as we worked in patience of our rule, Walk as we walked, much less by sight than faith, Hope as we hoped, despite our slips and scathe, Fearful in joy and confident in dule.” I know not if they see us or can see; But if they see us in our painful day, How looking back to earth from Paradise Do tears not gather in those loving eyes?— Ah, happy eyes! whose tears are wiped away Whether or not you bear to look on me. [Safe where I cannot lie yet] Safe where I cannot lie yet, Safe where I hope to lie too, Safe from the fume and the fret; You, and you, Whom I never forget. Safe from the frost and the snow, Safe from the storm and the sun, Safe where the seeds wait to grow One by one And to come back in blow. “Is it well with the child?” Lying a-dying. Have done with vain sighing: Life not lost but treasured, God Almighty pleasured, God's daughter fetched and carried, Christ's bride betrothed and married. Our tender little dove Meek-eyed and simple, Our love goes home to Love: There shall she walk in white, Where God shall be the Light, And God the Temple. [Dear Angels and dear disembodied Saints] Dear Angels and dear disembodied Saints Unseen around us, worshipping in rest, May wonder that man's heart so often faints And his steps lag along the heavenly quest, What while his foolish fancy moulds and paints A fonder hope than all they prove for best; A lying hope which undermines and taints His soul, as sin and sloth make manifest. Sloth, and a lie, and sin: shall these suffice The unfathomable heart of craving man, That heart which being a deep calls to the deep? Behold how many like us rose and ran When Christ, life-giver, roused them from their sleep To rise and run and rest in Paradise! “To every seed his own body.” Bone to his bone, grain to his grain of dust: A numberless reunion shall make whole Each blessed body for its blessed soul, Refashioning the aspects of the just. Each saint who died must live afresh, and must Ascend resplendent in the aureole Of his own proper glory to his goal, As seeds their proper bodies all upthrust. Each with his own not with another's grace, Each with his own not with another's heart, Each with his own not with another's face, Each dove-like soul mounts to his proper place:— O faces unforgotten! if to part Wrung sore, what will it be to re-embrace? “What good shall my life do me?” Have dead men long to wait?— There is a certain term For their bodies to the worm And their souls at heaven gate. Dust to dust, clod to clod, These precious things of God, Trampled underfoot by man And beast the appointed years.— Their longest life was but a span For change and smiles and tears. Is it worth while to live, Rejoice and grieve, Hope, fear, and die? Man with man, truth with lie, The slow show dwindles by: At last what shall we have Besides a grave?— Lies and shows no more, No fear, no pain, But after hope and sleep Dear joys again. Those who sowed shall reap: Those who bore The Cross shall wear the Crown: Those who clomb the steep There shall sit down. The Shepherd of the sheep Feeds His flock there, In watered pastures fair They rest and leap. “Is it worth while to live?” Be of good cheer: Love casts out fear: Rise up, achieve. SONGS FOR STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS. “Her Seed; It shall bruise thy head.” Astonished Heaven looked on when man was made, When fallen man reproved seemed half forgiven; Surely that oracle of hope first said, Astonished Heaven. Even so while one by one lost souls are shriven, A mighty multitude of quickened dead; Christ's love outnumbering ten times sevenfold seven. Even so while man still tosses high his head, While still the All-Holy Spirit's strife is striven;— Till one last trump shake earth, and undismayed Astonished Heaven. “Judge nothing before the time.” Love understands the mystery, whereof We can but spell a surface history: Love knows, remembers: let us trust in Love: Love understands the mystery. Love weighs the event, the long pre-history, Measures the depth beneath, the height above, The mystery, with the ante-mystery. To love and to be grieved befits a dove Silently telling her bead-history: Trust all to Love, be patient and approve: Love understands the mystery. [How great is little man!] How great is little man! Sun, moon, and stars respond to him, Shine or grow dim Harmonious with his span. How little is great man! More changeable than changeful moon, Nor half in tune With Heaven's harmonious plan. Ah, rich man! ah, poor man! Make ready for the testing day When wastes away What bears not fire or fan. Thou heir of all things, man, Pursue the saints by heavenward track: They looked not back; Run thou, as erst they ran. Little and great is man: Great if he will, or if he will A pigmy still; For what he will he can. [Man's life is but a working day] Man's life is but a working day Whose tasks are set aright: A time to work, a time to pray, And then a quiet night. And then, please God, a quiet night Where palms are green and robes are white; A long-drawn breath, a balm for sorrow, And all things lovely on the morrow. [If not with hope of life] If not with hope of life, Begin with fear of death: Strive the tremendous life-long strife Breath after breath. Bleed on beneath the rod; Weep on until thou see; Turn fear and hope to love of God Who loveth thee. Turn all to love, poor soul; Be love thy watch and ward; Be love thy starting-point, thy goal, And thy reward. “The day is at hand.” Watch yet a while, Weep till that day shall dawn when thou shalt smile: Watch till the day When all save only Love shall pass away. Then Love rejoicing shall forget to weep, Shall hope or fear no more, or watch or sleep, But only love and stint not, deep beyond deep. Now we sow love in tears, but then shall reap. Have patience as True Love's own flock of sheep: Have patience with His Love Who served for us, Who reigns for us above. “Endure hardness.” A cold wind stirs the blackthorn To burgeon and to blow, Besprinkling half-green hedges With flakes and sprays of snow. Thro' coldness and thro' keenness, Dear hearts, take comfort so: Somewhere or other doubtless These make the blackthorn blow. “Whither the Tribes go up, even the Tribes of the Lord.” Light is our sorrow for it ends tomorrow, Light is our death which cannot hold us fast; So brief a sorrow can be scarcely sorrow, Or death be death so quickly past. One night, no more, of pain that turns to pleasure, One night, no more, of weeping weeping sore; And then the heaped-up measure beyond measure, In quietness for evermore. Our face is set like flint against our trouble, Yet many things there are which comfort us; This bubble is a rainbow-coloured bubble, This bubble-life tumultuous. Our sails are set to cross the tossing river, Our face is set to reach Jerusalem; We toil awhile, but then we rest for ever, Sing with all Saints and rest with them. [Where never tempest heaveth] Where never tempest heaveth, Nor sorrow grieveth, Nor death bereaveth, Nor hope deceiveth, Sleep. Where never shame bewaileth, Nor serpent traileth, Nor death prevaileth, Nor harvest faileth, Reap. [Marvel of marvels, if I myself shall behold] Marvel of marvels, if I myself shall behold With mine own eyes my King in His city of gold; Where the least of lambs is spotless white in the fold, Where the least and last of saints in spotless white is stoled, Where the dimmest head beyond a moon is aureoled. O saints, my beloved, now mouldering to mould in the mould, Shall I see you lift your heads, see your cerements unrolled, See with these very eyes? who now in darkness and cold Tremble for the midnight cry, the rapture, the tale untold, “The Bridegroom cometh, cometh, His Bride to enfold.” Cold it is, my beloved, since your funeral bell was tolled: Cold it is, O my King, how cold alone on the wold. “What is that to thee? follow thou me.” Lie still, my restive heart, lie still: God's Word to thee saith, “Wait and bear.” The good which He appoints is good, The good which He denies were ill: Yea, subtle comfort is thy care, Thy hurt a help not understood. “Friend, go up higher,” to one: to one, “Friend, enter thou My joy,” He saith: To one, “Be faithful unto death.” For some a wilderness doth flower, Or day's work in one hour is done:— “But thou, could'st thou not watch one hour?” Lord, I had chosen another lot, But then I had not chosen well; Thy choice and only Thine is good: No different lot, search heaven or hell, Had blessed me fully understood; None other, which Thou orderest not. “Worship God.” Lord, if Thy word had been “Worship Me not, For I than thou am holier: draw not near:” We had besieged Thy Face with prayer and tear And manifold abasement in our lot, Our crooked ground, our thorned and thistled plot; Envious of flawless Angels in their sphere, Envious of brutes, and envious of the mere Unliving and undying unbegot. But now Thou hast said, “Worship Me, and give Thy heart to Me, My child:” now therefore we Think twice before we stoop to worship Thee: We proffer half a heart while life is strong And strung with hope; so sweet it is to live! Wilt Thou not wait? Yea, Thou hast waited long. “Afterward he repented, and went.” Lord, when my heart was whole I kept it back And grudged to give it Thee. Now then that it is broken, must I lack Thy kind word “Give it Me”? Silence would be but just, and Thou art just. Yet since I lie here shattered in the dust, With still an eye to lift to Thee, A broken heart to give, I think that Thou wilt bid me live, And answer “Give it Me.” “Are they not all Ministering Spirits?” Lord, whomsoever Thou shalt send to me, Let that same be Mine Angel predilect: Veiled or unveiled, benignant or austere, Aloof or near; Thine, therefore mine, elect. So may my soul nurse patience day by day, Watch on and pray Obedient and at peace; Living a lonely life in hope, in faith; Loving till death, When life, not love, shall cease. . . . . Lo, thou mine Angel with transfigured face Brimful of grace, Brimful of love for me! Did I misdoubt thee all that weary while, Thee with a smile For me as I for thee? [Our life is long. Not so, wise Angels say] Our life is long. Not so, wise Angels say Who watch us waste it, trembling while they weigh Against eternity one squandered day. Our life is long. Not so, the Saints protest, Filled full of consolation and of rest: “Short ill, long good, one long unending best.” Our life is long. Christ's word sounds different: “Night cometh: no more work when day is spent. Repent and work today, work and repent.” Lord, make us like Thy Host who day nor night Rest not from adoration, their delight, Crying “Holy, Holy, Holy,” in the height. Lord, make us like Thy Saints who wait and long Contented: bound in hope and freed from wrong They speed (may be) their vigil with a song. Lord, make us like Thyself: for thirty-three Slow years of toil seemed not too long to Thee, That where Thou art, there Thy Beloved might be. [Lord, what have I to offer? sickening fear] Lord, what have I to offer? sickening fear And a heart-breaking loss. Are these the cross Thou givest me? then dear I will account this cross. If this is all I have, accept even this Poor priceless offering, A quaking heart with all that therein is, O Thou my thorn-crowned King. Accept the whole, my God, accept my heart And its own love within: Wilt Thou accept us and not sift apart? —Only sift out my sin. [Joy is but sorrow] Joy is but sorrow, While we know It ends tomorrow:— Even so! Joy with lifted veil Shows a face as pale As the fair changing moon so fair and frail. Pain is but pleasure, If we know It heaps up treasure:— Even so! Turn, transfigured Pain, Sweetheart, turn again, For fair thou art as moonrise after rain. [Can I know it?—Nay.—] Can I know it?—Nay.— Shall I know it?—Yea, When all mists have cleared away For ever and aye.— Why not then today?— Who hath said thee nay? Lift a hopeful heart and pray In a humble way.— Other hearts are gay.— Ask not joy today: Toil today along thy way Keeping grudge at bay.— On a past May-day Flowers pranked all the way; Nightingales sang out their say On a night of May.— Dost thou covet May On an Autumn day? Foolish memory saith its say Of sweets past away.— Gone the bloom of May, Autumn beareth bay: Flowerless wreath for head grown grey Seemly were today.— Dost thou covet bay? Ask it not today: Rather for a palm-branch pray; None will say thee nay. “When my heart is vexed I will complain.” “The fields are white to harvest, look and see, Are white abundantly. The full-orbed harvest moon shines clear, The harvest time draws near, Be of good cheer.” “Ah, woe is me! I have no heart for harvest time, Grown sick with hope deferred from chime to chime.” “But Christ can give thee heart Who loveth thee: Can set thee in the eternal ecstasy Of His great jubilee: Can give thee dancing heart and shining face, And lips filled full of grace, And pleasures as the rivers and the sea. Who knocketh at His door He welcomes evermore: Kneel down before That ever-open door (The time is short) and smite Thy breast, and pray with all thy might.” “What shall I say?” “Nay, pray. Tho' one but say ‘Thy Will be done,’ He hath not lost his day At set of sun.” “Praying always.” After midnight, in the dark The clock strikes one, New day has begun. Look up and hark! With singing heart forestall the carolling lark. After mid-day, in the light The clock strikes one, Day-fall has begun. Cast up, set right The day's account against the on-coming night. After noon and night, one day For ever one Ends not, once begun. Whither away, O brothers and O sisters? Pause and pray. “As thy days, so shall thy strength be.” Day that hath no tinge of night, Night that hath no tinge of day, These at last will come to sight Not to fade away. This is twilight that we know, Scarcely night and scarcely day; This hath been from long ago Shed around man's way: Step by step to utter night, Step by step to perfect day, To the Left Hand or the Right Leading all away. This is twilight: be it so; Suited to our strength our day: Let us follow on to know, Patient by the way. [A heavy heart, if ever heart was heavy] A heavy heart, if ever heart was heavy, I offer Thee this heavy heart of me. Are such as this the hearts Thou art fain to levy To do and dare for Thee, to bleed for Thee? Ah, blessed heaviness, if such they be! Time was I bloomed with blossom and stood leafy How long before the fruit, if fruit there be: Lord, if by bearing fruit my heart grows heavy, Leafless and bloomless yet accept of me The stripped fruit-bearing heart I offer Thee. Lifted to Thee my heart weighs not so heavy, It leaps and lightens lifted up to Thee; It sings, it hopes to sing amid the bevy Of thousand thousand choirs that sing, and see Thy Face, me loving, for Thou lovest me. [If love is not worth loving, then life is not worth living] If love is not worth loving, then life is not worth living, Nor aught is worth remembering but well forgot; For store is not worth storing and gifts are not worth giving, If love is not; And idly cold is death-cold, and life-heat idly hot, And vain is any offering and vainer our receiving, And vanity of vanities is all our lot. Better than life's heaving heart is death's heart unheaving, Better than the opening leaves are the leaves that rot, For there is nothing left worth achieving or retrieving, If love is not. [What is it Jesus saith unto the soul?] What is it Jesus saith unto the soul? “Take up the Cross, and come and follow Me.” One word He saith to all men: none may be Without a cross yet hope to touch the goal. Then heave it bravely up, and brace thy whole Body to bear; it will not weigh on thee Past strength; or if it crush thee to thy knee Take heart of grace, for grace shall be thy dole. Give thanks today, and let tomorrow take Heed to itself; today imports thee more, Tomorrow may not dawn like yesterday: Until that unknown morrow go thy way, Suffer and work and strive for Jesus' sake:— Who tells thee what tomorrow keeps in store? [They lie at rest, our blessed dead] They lie at rest, our blessed dead; The dews drop cool above their head, They knew not when fleet summer fled. Together all, yet each alone; Each laid at rest beneath his own Smooth turf or white allotted stone. When shall our slumber sink so deep, And eyes that wept and eyes that weep Weep not in the sufficient sleep? God be with you, our great and small, Our loves, our best beloved of all, Our own beyond the salt sea-wall. “Ye that fear Him, both small and great.” Great or small below, Great or small above; Be we Thine, whom Thou dost know And love: First or last on earth, First or last in Heaven; Only weighted with Thy worth, And shriven. Wise or ignorant, Strong or weak; Amen; Sifted now, cast down, in want:— But then? Then,—when sun nor moon, Time nor death, finds place, Seeing in the eternal noon Thy Face: Then,—when tears and sighing, Changes, sorrows, cease; Living by Thy Life undying In peace: Then,—when all creation Keeps its jubilee, Crowned amid Thy holy nation; Crowned, discrowned, in adoration Of Thee. “Called to be Saints.” The lowest place. Ah, Lord, how steep and high That lowest place whereon a saint shall sit! Which of us halting, trembling, pressing nigh, Shall quite attain to it? Yet, Lord, Thou pressest nigh to hail and grace Some happy soul, it may be still unfit For Right Hand or for Left Hand, but whose place Waits there prepared for it. [The sinner's own fault? So it was.] The sinner's own fault? So it was. If every own fault found us out, Dogged us and hedged us round about, What comfort should we take because Not half our due we thus wrung out? Clearly his own fault. Yet I think My fault in part, who did not pray But lagged and would not lead the way. I, haply, proved his missing link. God help us both to mend and pray. [Who cares for earthly bread tho' white?] Who cares for earthly bread tho' white? Nay, heavenly sheaf of harvest corn! Who cares for earthly crown tonight? Nay, heavenly crown tomorrow morn! I will not wander left or right, The straightest road is shortest too; And since we hold all hope in view And triumph where is no more pain, Tonight I bid good night to you And bid you meet me there again. [Laughing Life cries at the feast,—] Laughing Life cries at the feast,— Craving Death cries at the door,— “Fish, or fowl, or fatted beast?” “Come with me, thy feast it o'er.”— “Wreathe the violets.”—“Watch them fade.”— “I am sunshine.”—“I am shade: I am the sun-burying west.”— “I am pleasure.”—“I am rest: Come with me, for I am best.” “The end is not yet.” Home by different ways. Yet all Homeward bound thro' prayer and praise, Young with old, and great with small, Home by different ways. Many nights and many days Wind must bluster, rain must fall, Quake the quicksand, shift the haze. Live hath called and death will call Saints who praying kneel at gaze, Ford the flood or leap the wall, Home by different ways. [Who would wish back the Saints upon our rough] Who would wish back the Saints upon our rough Wearisome road? Wish back a breathless soul Just at the goal? My soul, praise God For all dear souls which have enough. I would not fetch one back to hope with me A hope deferred, To taste a cup that slips From thirsting lips:— Hath he not heard And seen what was to hear and see? How could I stand to answer the rebuke If one should say: “O friend of little faith, Good was my death, And good my day Of rest, and good the sleep I took”? “That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is Man.” “Eye hath not seen:”—yet man hath known and weighed A hundred thousand marvels that have been: What is it which (the Word of Truth hath said) Eye hath not seen? “Ear hath not heard:”—yet harpings of delight, Trumpets of triumph, song and spoken word, Man knows them all: what lovelier, loftier might Hath ear not heard? “Nor heart conceived:”—yet man hath now desired Beyond all reach, beyond his hope believed, Loved beyond death: what fire shall yet be fired No heart conceived? “Deep calls to deep:”—man's depth would be despair But for God's deeper depth: we sow to reap, Have patience, wait, betake ourselves to prayer: Deep answereth deep. [Of each sad word which is more sorrowful] Of each sad word which is more sorrowful, “Sorrow” or “Disappointment”? I have heard Subtle inflections baffling subtlest rule, Of each sad word. Sorrow can mourn: and lo! a mourning bird Sings sweetly to sweet echoes of its dule, While silent disappointment broods unstirred. Yet both nurse hope, where Penitence keeps school Who makes fools wise and saints of them that erred: Wise men shape stepping stone, or curb, or tool, Of each sad word. “I see that all things come to an end.” I. No more! while sun and planets fly, And wind and storm and seasons four, And while we live and while we die,— No more. Nevertheless old ocean's roar, And wide earth's multitudinous cry, And echo's pent reverberant store Shall hush to silence by and bye: Ah, rosy world gone cold and hoar! Man opes no more a mortal eye, No more. “But Thy Commandment is exceeding broad.” II. Once again to wake, nor wish to sleep; Once again to feel, nor feel a pain! Rouse thy soul to watch and pray and weep Once again. Hope afresh, for hope shall not be vain: Start afresh along the exceeding steep Road to glory, long and rough and plain. Sow and reap: for while these moments creep, Time and earth and life are on the wane: Now, in tears; tomorrow, laugh and reap Once again. Sursam Corda. “Lift up your hearts.” “We lift them up.” Ah me! I cannot, Lord, lift up my heart to Thee: Stoop, lift it up, that where Thou art I too may be. “Give Me thy heart.” I would not say Thee nay, But have no power to keep or give away My heart: stoop, Lord, and take it to Thyself today. Stoop, Lord, as once before, now once anew Stoop, Lord, and hearken, hearken, Lord, and do, And take my will, and take my heart, and take me too. [O ye, who are not dead and fit] O ye, who are not dead and fit Like blasted tree beside the pit But for the axe that levels it, Living show life of love, whereof The force wields earth and heaven above: Who knows not love begetteth love? Love poises earth in space, Love rolls Wide worlds rejoicing on their poles, And girds them round with aureoles. Love lights the sun, Love thro' the dark Lights the moon's evanescent arc, Lights up the star, lights up the spark. O ye who taste that love is sweet, Set waymarks for all doubtful feet That stumble on in search of it. Sing notes of love: that some who hear Far off inert may lend an ear, Rise up and wonder and draw near. Lead life of love: that others who Behold your life, may kindle too With love, and cast their lot with you. [Where shall I find a white rose blowing?—] Where shall I find a white rose blowing?— Out in the garden where all sweets be.— But out in my garden the snow was snowing And never a white rose opened for me. Nought but snow and a wind were blowing And snowing. Where shall I find a blush rose blushing?— On the garden wall or the garden bed.— But out in my garden the rain was rushing And never a blush rose raised its head. Nothing glowing, flushing or blushing: Rain rushing. Where shall I find a red rose budding?— Out in the garden where all things grow.— But out in my garden a flood was flooding And never a red rose began to blow. Out in a flooding what should be budding? All flooding! Now is winter and now is sorrow, No roses but only thorns today: Thorns will put on roses tomorrow, Winter and sorrow scudding away. No more winter and no more sorrow Tomorrow. “Redeeming the Time.” A life of hope deferred too often is A life of wasted opportunities; A life of perished hope too often is A life of all-lost opportunities: Yet hope is but the flower and not the root, And hope is still the flower and not the fruit;— Arise and sow and weed: a day shall come When also thou shalt keep thy harvest home. “Now they desire a Better Country.” Love said nay, while Hope kept saying All his sweetest say, Hope so keen to start a-maying!— Love said nay. Love was bent to watch and pray; Long the watching, long the praying; Hope grew drowsy, pale and grey. Hope in dreams set off a-straying, All his dream-world flushed by May; While unslumbering, praying, weighing, Love said nay. A CASTLE-BUILDER'S WORLD. “The line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.” Unripe harvest there hath none to reap it From the misty gusty place, Unripe vineyard there hath none to keep it In unprofitable space. Living men and women are not found there, Only masks in flocks and shoals; Flesh-and-bloodless hazy masks surround there, Ever wavering orbs and poles; Flesh-and-bloodless vapid masks abound there, Shades of bodies without souls. “These all wait upon Thee.” Innocent eyes not ours Are made to look on flowers, Eyes of small birds and insects small: Morn after summer morn The sweet rose on her thorn Opens her bosom to them all. The least and last of things That soar on quivering wings, Or crawl among the grass blades out of sight, Have just as clear a right To their appointed portion of delight As Queens or Kings. “Doeth well . . . doeth better.” My love whose heart is tender said to me, “A moon lacks light except her sun befriend her. Let us keep tryst in heaven, dear Friend,” said she, My love whose heart is tender. From such a loftiness no words could bend her: Yet still she spoke of “us” and spoke as “we,” Her hope substantial, while my hope grew slender. Now keeps she tryst beyond earth's utmost sea, Wholly at rest, tho' storms should toss and rend her; And still she keeps my heart and keeps its key, My love whose heart is tender. [Our heaven must be within ourselves] Our heaven must be within ourselves, Our home and heaven the work of faith All thro' this race of life which shelves Downward to death. So faith shall build the boundary wall, And hope shall plant the secret bower, That both may show magnifical With gem and flower. While over all a dome must spread, And love shall be that dome above; And deep foundations must be laid, And these are love. “Vanity of Vanities.” Of all the downfalls in the world, The flutter of an Autumn leaf Grows grievous by suggesting grief: Who thought, when Spring was first unfurled, Of this? The wide world lay empearled; Who thought of frost that nips the world? Sigh on, my ditty. There lurk a hundred subtle stings To prick us in our daily walk: An apple cankered on its stalk, A robin snared for all his wings, A voice that sang but never sings; Yea, sight or sound or silence stings. Kind Lord, show pity. [The hills are tipped with sunshine, while I walk] The hills are tipped with sunshine, while I walk In shadows dim and cold: The unawakened rose sleeps on her stalk In a bud's fold, Until the sun flood all the world with gold. The hills are crowned with glory, and the glow Flows widening down apace: Unto the sunny hill-tops I, set low, Lift a tired face,— Ah, happy rose, content to wait for grace! How tired a face, how tired a brain, how tired A heart I lift, who long For something never felt but still desired; Sunshine and song, Song where the choirs of sunny heaven stand choired. [Scarce tolerable life, which all life long] Scarce tolerable life, which all life long Is dominated by one dread of death; Is such life, life? if so, who pondereth May call salt sweetness or call discord song. Ah me, this solitude where swarms a throng! Life slowly grows and dwindles breath by breath: Death slowly grows on us; no word it saith, Its cords all lengthened and its pillars strong. Life dies apace, a life that but deceives: Death reigns as tho' it lived, and yet is dead: Where is the life that dies not but that lives? The sweet long life, immortal, ever young, True life that wooes us with a silver tongue Of hope, much said and much more left unsaid. [All heaven is blazing yet] All heaven is blazing yet With the meridian sun: Make haste, unshadowing sun, make haste to set; O lifeless life, have done. I choose what once I chose; What once I willed, I will: Only the heart its own bereavement knows; O clamorous heart, lie still. That which I chose, I choose; That which I willed, I will; That which I once refused, I still refuse: O hope deferred, be still. That which I chose and choose And will is Jesus' Will: He hath not lost his life who seems to lose: O hope deferred, hope still. “Balm in Gilead.” Heartsease I found, where Love-lies-bleeding Empurpled all the ground: Whatever flowers I missed unheeding, Heartsease I found. Yet still my garden mound Stood sore in need of watering, weeding, And binding growths unbound. Ah, when shades fell to light succeeding I scarcely dared look round: “Love-lies-bleeding” was all my pleading, Heartsease I found. “In the day of his Espousals.” That Song of Songs which is Solomon's Sinks and rises, and loves and longs, Thro' temperate zones and torrid zones, That Song of Songs. Fair its floating moon with her prongs: Love is laid for its paving stones: Right it sings without thought of wrongs. Doves it hath with music of moans, Queens in throngs and damsels in throngs, High tones and mysterious undertones, That Song of Songs. “She came from the uttermost part of the earth.” “The half was not told me,” said Sheba's Queen, Weighing that wealth of wisdom and of gold: “Thy fame falls short of this that I have seen: The half was not told. “Happy thy servants who stand to behold, Stand to drink in thy gracious speech and mien; Happy, thrice happy, the flock of thy fold. “As the darkened moon while a shadow between Her face and her kindling sun is rolled, I depart; but my heart keeps memory green: The half was not told.” [Alleluia! or Alas! my heart is crying] Alleluia! or Alas! my heart is crying: So yours is sighing; Or replying with content undying, Alleluia! Alas! grieves overmuch for pain that is ending, Hurt that is mending, Life descending soon to be ascending, Alleluia! [The Passion Flower hath sprung up tall] The Passion Flower hath sprung up tall, Hath east and west its arms outspread; The heliotrope shoots up its head To clear the shadow of the wall: Down looks the Passion Flower, The heliotrope looks upward still, Hour by hour On the heavenward hill. The Passion Flower blooms red or white, A shadowed white, a cloudless red; Caressingly it droops its head, Its leaves, its tendrils, from the light: Because that lowlier flower Looks up, but mounts not half so high, Hour by hour Tending toward the sky. God's Acre. Hail, garden of confident hope! Where sweet seeds are quickening in darkness and cold; For how sweet and how young will they be When they pierce thro' the mould. Balm, myrtle, and heliotrope There watch and there wait out of sight for their Sun: While the Sun, which they see not, doth see Each and all one by one. “The Flowers appear on the Earth.” Young girls wear flowers, Young brides a flowery wreath, But next we plant them In garden plots of death. Whose lot is best: The maiden's curtained rest, Or bride's whose hoped-for sweet May yet outstrip her feet? Ah! what are such as these To death's sufficing ease? He sleeps indeed who sleeps in peace Where night and morning meet. Dear are the blossoms For bride's or maiden's head, But dearer planted Around our blessed dead. Those mind us of decay And joys that fade away, These preach to us perfection, Long love and resurrection. We make our graveyards fair, For spirit-like birds of air, For Angels may be finding there Lost Eden's own delection. “Thou knewest . . . thou oughtest therefore.” Behold in heaven a floating dazzling cloud, So dazzling that I could but cry Alas! Alas, because I felt how low I was; Alas, within my spirit if not aloud, Foreviewing my last breathless bed and shroud: Thus pondering, I glanced downward on the grass; And the grass bowed when airs of heaven would pass, Lifting itself again when it had bowed. That grass spake comfort; weak it was and low, Yet strong enough and high enough to bend In homage at a message from the sky: As the grass did and prospered, so will I; Tho' knowing little, doing what I know, And strong in patient weakness till the end. “Go in Peace.” Can peach renew lost bloom, Or violet lost perfume, Or sullied snow turn white as overnight? Man cannot compass it, yet never fear: The leper Naaman Shows what God will and can; God Who worked there is working here; Wherefore let shame, not gloom, betinge thy brow, God Who worked then is working now. “Half dead.” O Christ the Life, look on me where I lie Ready to die: O Good Samaritan, nay, pass not by. O Christ, my Life, pour in Thine oil and wine To keep me Thine; Me ever Thine, and Thee for ever mine. Watch by Thy saints and sinners, watch by all Thy great and small: Once Thou didst call us all,—O Lord, recall. Think how Thy saints love sinners, how they pray And hope alway, And thereby grow more like Thee day by day. O Saint of saints, if those with prayer and vow Succour us now. . . . It was not they died for us, it was Thou. “One of the Soldiers with a Spear pierced His Side.” Ah, Lord, we all have pierced Thee: wilt Thou be Wroth with us all to slay us all? Nay, Lord, be this thing far from Thee and me: By whom should we arise, for we are small, By whom if not by Thee? Lord, if of us who pierced Thee Thou spare one, Spare yet one more to love Thy Face, And yet another of poor souls undone, Another, and another—God of grace, Let mercy overrun. [Where love is, there comes sorrow] Where love is, there comes sorrow Today or else tomorrow: Endure the mood, Love only means our good. Where love is, there comes pleasure With or withouten measure, Early or late Cheering the sorriest state. Where love is, all perfection Is stored for heart's delection; For where love is Dwells every sort of bliss. Who would not choose a sorrow Love's self will cheer tomorrow? One day of sorrow, Then such a long tomorrow! [Bury Hope out of sight] Bury Hope out of sight, No book for it and no bell; It never could bear the light Even while growing and well: Think if now it could bear The light on its face of care And grey scattered hair. No grave for Hope in the earth, But deep in that silent soul Which rang no bell for its birth And rings no funeral toll. Cover its once bright head; Nor odours nor tears be shed: It lived once, it is dead. Brief was the day of its power, The day of its grace how brief: As the fading of a flower, As the falling of a leaf, So brief its day and its hour; No bud more and no bower Or hint of a flower. Shall many wail it? not so: Shall one bewail it? not one: Thus it hath been from long ago, Thus it shall be beneath the sun. O fleet sun, make haste to flee; O rivers, fill up the sea; O Death, set the dying free. The sun nor loiters nor speeds, The rivers run as they ran, Thro' clouds or thro' windy reeds All run as when all began. Only Death turns at our cries:— Lo, the Hope we buried with sighs Alive in Death's eyes! A Churchyard Song of Patient Hope. All tears done away with the bitter unquiet sea, Death done away from among the living at last, Man shall say of sorrow—Love grant it to thee and me!— At last, “It is past.” Shall I say of pain, “It is past,” nor say it with thee, Thou heart of my heart, thou soul of my soul, my Friend? Shalt thou say of pain, “It is past,” nor say it with me Beloved to the end? [One woe is past. Come what come will] One woe is past. Come what come will Thus much is ended and made fast: Two woes may overhang us still; One woe is past. As flowers when winter puffs its last Wake in the vale, trail up the hill, Nor wait for skies to overcast; So meek souls rally from the chill Of pain and fear and poisonous blast, To lift their heads: come good, come ill, One woe is past. “Take no thought for the morrow.” Who knows? God knows: and what He knows Is well and best. The darkness hideth not from Him, but glows Clear as the morning or the evening rose Of east or west. Wherefore man's strength is to sit still: Not wasting care To antedate tomorrow's good or ill; Yet watching meekly, watching with good will, Watching to prayer. Some rising or some setting ray From east or west, If not today, why then another day Will light each dove upon the homeward way Safe to her nest. “Consider the Lilies of the field.” Solomon most glorious in array Put not on his glories without care:— Clothe us as Thy lilies of a day, As the lilies Thou accountest fair, Lilies of Thy making, Of Thy love partaking, Filling with free fragrance earth and air: Thou Who gatherest lilies, gather us and wear. “Son, remember.” I laid beside thy gate, am Lazarus; See me or see me not I still am there, Hungry and thirsty, sore and sick and bare, Dog-comforted and crumbs-solicitous: While thou in all thy ways art sumptuous, Daintily clothed, with dainties for thy fare: Thus a world's wonder thou art quit of care, And be I seen or not seen I am thus. One day a worm for thee, a worm for me: With my worm angel songs and trumpet burst And plenitude an end of all desire: But what for thee, alas! but what for thee? Fire and an unextinguishable thirst, Thirst in an unextinguishable fire. “Heaviness may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning.” No thing is great on this side of the grave, Nor any thing of any stable worth: Whatso is born from earth returns to earth: No thing we grasp proves half the thing we crave: The tidal wave shrinks to the ebbing wave: Laughter is folly, madness lurks in mirth: Mankind sets off a-dying from the birth: Life is a losing game, with what to save? Thus I sat mourning like a mournful owl, And like a doleful dragon made ado, Companion of all monsters of the dark: When lo! the light cast off its nightly cowl, And up to heaven flashed a carolling lark, And all creation sang its hymn anew. While all creation sang its hymn anew What could I do but sing a stave in tune? Spectral on high hung pale the vanishing moon Where a last gleam of stars hung paling too. Lark's lay—a cockcrow—with a scattered few Soft early chirpings—with a tender croon Of doves—a hundred thousand calls, and soon A hundred thousand answers sweet and true. These set me singing too at unawares: One note for all delights and charities, One note for hope reviving with the light, One note for every lovely thing that is; Till while I sang my heart shook off its cares And revelled in the land of no more night. “The Will of the Lord be done.” O Lord, fulfil Thy Will Be the days few or many, good or ill: Prolong them, to suffice For offering up ourselves Thy sacrifice; Shorten them if Thou wilt, To make in righteousness an end of guilt. Yea, they will not be long To souls who learn to sing a patient song; Yea, short they will not be To souls on tiptoe to flee home to Thee. O Lord, fulfil Thy Will: Make Thy Will ours, and keep us patient still Be the days few or many, good or ill. “Lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven.” Treasure plies a feather, Pleasure spreadeth wings, Taking flight together,— Ah! my cherished things. Fly away, poor pleasure, That art so brief a thing: Fly away, poor treasure, That hast so swift a wing. Pleasure, to be pleasure, Must come without a wing: Treasure, to be treasure, Must be a stable thing. Treasure without feather, Pleasure without wings, Elsewhere dwell together And are heavenly things. “Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth.” “One sorrow more? I thought the tale complete.”— He bore amiss who grudges what he bore: Stretch out thy hands and urge thy feet to meet One sorrow more. Yea, make thy count for two or three or four: The kind Physician will not slack to treat His patient while there's rankling in the sore. Bear up in anguish, ease will yet be sweet; Bear up all day, for night has rest in store: Christ bears thy burden with thee, rise and greet One sorrow more. “Then shall ye shout.” It seems an easy thing Mayhap one day to sing Yet the next day We cannot sing or say. Keep silence with good heart, While silence fits our part: Another day We shall both sing and say. Keep silence, counting time To strike in at the chime: Prepare to sound,— Our part is coming round. Can we not sing or say? In silence let us pray, And meditate Our love-song while we wait. [Everything that is born must die] Everything that is born must die; Everything that can sigh may sing; Rocks in equal balance, low or high, Everything. Honeycomb is weighed against a sting; Hope and fear take turns to touch the sky; Height and depth respond alternating. O my soul, spread wings of love to fly, Wings of dove that soars on home-bound wing: Love trusts Love, till Love shall justify Everything. [Lord, grant us calm, if calm can set forth Thee] Lord, grant us calm, if calm can set forth Thee; Or tempest, if a tempest set Thee forth; Wind from the east or west or south or north, Or congelation of a silent sea, With stillness of each tremulous aspen tree. Still let fruit fall, or hang upon the tree; Still let the east and west, the south and north, Curb in their winds, or plough a thundering sea; Still let the earth abide to set Thee forth, Or vanish like a smoke to set forth Thee. Changing Chimes. It was not warning that our fathers lacked, It is not warning that we lack today. The Voice that cried still cries: “Rise up and act: Watch alway,—watch and pray,—watch alway,— All men.” Alas, if aught was lacked goodwill was lacked; Alas, goodwill is what we lack today. O gracious Voice, grant grace that all may act, Watch and act,—watch and pray,—watch alway.— Amen. “Thy Servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” Sorrow of saints is sorrow of a day, Gladness of saints is gladness evermore: Send on thy hope, send on thy will before To chant God's praise along the narrow way. Stir up His praises if the flesh would sway, Exalt His praises if the world press sore, Peal out His praises if black Satan roar A hundred thousand lies to say them nay. Devil and Death and Hades, threefold cord Not quickly broken, front thee to thy face; Front thou them with a face of tenfold flint: Shout for the battle, David! never stint Body or breath or blood, but proof in grace Die for thy Lord, as once for thee thy Lord. [Thro' burden and heat of the day] Thro' burden and heat of the day How weary the hands and the feet That labour with scarcely a stay, Thro' burden and heat! Tired toiler whose sleep shall be sweet, Kneel down, it will rest thee to pray: Then forward, for daylight is fleet. Cool shadows show lengthening and grey, Cool twilight will soon be complete: What matters this wearisome way Thro' burden and heat? “Then I commended Mirth.” “A merry heart is a continual feast.” Then take we life and all things in good part: To fast grows festive while we keep at least A merry heart Well pleased with nature and well pleased with art; A merry heart makes cheer for man and beast, And fancies music in a creaking cart. Some day, a restful heart whose toils have ceased, A heavenly heart gone home from earthly mart: Today, blow wind from west or wind from east, A merry heart. Sorrow hath a double voice, Sharp today but sweet tomorrow: Wait in patience, hope, rejoice, Tried friends of sorrow. Pleasure hath a double taste, Sweet today but sharp tomorrow: Friends of pleasure, rise in haste, Make friends with sorrow. Pleasure set aside today Comes again to rule tomorrow: Welcomed sorrow will not stay, Farewell to sorrow! [Shadows today, while shadows show God's Will.] Shadows today, while shadows show God's Will. Light were not good except He sent us light. Shadows today, because this day is night Whose marvels and whose mysteries fulfil Their course and deep in darkness serve Him still. Thou dim aurora, on the extremest height Of airy summits wax not over-bright; Refrain thy rose, refrain thy daffodil. Until God's Word go forth to kindle thee And garland thee and bid thee stoop to us, Blush in the heavenly choirs and glance not down: Today we race in darkness for a crown, In darkness for beatitude to be, In darkness for the city luminous. “Truly the Light is sweet.” Light colourless doth colour all things else: Where light dwells pleasure dwells And peace excels. Then rise and shine, Thou shadowed soul of mine, And let a cheerful rainbow make thee fine. Light, fountain of all beauty and delight, Leads day forth from the night, Turns blackness white. Light waits for thee Where all have eyes to see: Oh, well is thee, and happy shalt thou be! “Are ye not much better than they?” The twig sprouteth, The moth outeth, The plant springeth, The bird singeth: Tho' little we sing today Yet are we better than they; Tho' growing with scarce a showing, Yet, please God, we are growing. The twig teacheth, The moth preacheth, The plant vaunteth, The bird chanteth, God's mercy overflowing Merciful past man's knowing. Please God to keep us growing Till the awful day of mowing. “Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house.” Wisest of sparrows that sparrow which sitteth alone Perched on the housetop, its own upper chamber, for nest; Wisest of swallows that swallow which timely has flown Over the turbulent sea to the land of its rest: Wisest of sparrows and swallows, if I were as wise! Wisest of spirits that spirit which dwelleth apart Hid in the Presence of God for a chapel and nest, Sending a wish and a will and a passionate heart Over the eddy of life to that Presence in rest: Seated alone and in peace till God bids it arise. “I am small and of no reputation.” The least, if so I am; If so, less than the least, May I reach heaven to glorify the Lamb And sit down at the Feast. I fear and I am small, Whence am I of good cheer; For I who hear Thy call, have heard Thee call To Thee the small who fear. [O Christ my God Who seest the unseen] O Christ my God Who seest the unseen, O Christ my God Who knowest the unknown, Thy mighty Blood was poured forth to atone For every sin that can be or hath been. O Thou Who seest what I cannot see, Thou Who didst love us all so long ago, O Thou Who knowest what I must not know, Remember all my hope, remember me. [Yea, if Thou wilt, Thou canst put up Thy sword] Yea, if Thou wilt, Thou canst put up Thy sword; But what if Thou shouldst sheathe it to the hilt Within the heart that sues to Thee, O Lord? Yea, if Thou wilt. For if Thou wilt Thou canst purge out the guilt Of all, of any, even the most abhorred: Thou canst pluck down, rebuild, build up the unbuilt. Who wanders, canst Thou gather by love's cord? Who sinks, uplift from the under-sucking silt To set him on Thy rock within Thy ward? Yea, if Thou wilt. [Sweetness of rest when Thou sheddest rest] Sweetness of rest when Thou sheddest rest, Sweetness of patience till then; Only the Will of our God is best For all the millions of men. For all the millions on earth today, On earth and under the earth; Waiting for earth to vanish away, Waiting to come to the birth. [O foolish Soul! to make thy count] O foolish Soul! to make thy count For languid falls and much forgiven, When like a flame thou mightest mount To storm and carry heaven. A life so faint,—is this to live? A goal so mean,—is this a goal? Christ love thee, remedy, forgive, Save thee, O foolish Soul. [Before the beginning Thou hast foreknown the end] Before the beginning Thou hast foreknown the end, Before the birthday the death-bed was seen of Thee: Cleanse what I cannot cleanse, mend what I cannot mend, O Lord All-Merciful, be merciful to me. While the end is drawing near I know not mine end; Birth I recall not, my death I cannot foresee: O God, arise to defend, arise to befriend, O Lord All-Merciful, be merciful to me. [The goal in sight! Look up and sing] The goal in sight! Look up and sing, Set faces full against the light, Welcome with rapturous welcoming The goal in sight. Let be the left, let be the right: Straight forward make your footsteps ring A loud alarum thro' the night. Death hunts you, yea, but reft of sting; Your bed is green, your shroud is white: Hail! Life and Death and all that bring The goal in sight. [Looking back along life's trodden way] Looking back along life's trodden way Gleams and greenness linger on the track; Distance melts and mellows all today, Looking back. Rose and purple and a silvery grey, Is that cloud the cloud we called so black? Evening harmonizes all today, Looking back. Foolish feet so prone to halt or stray, Foolish heart so restive on the rack! Yesterday we sighed, but not today Looking back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME III I Separately Published Poems DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN. Chide not; let me breathe a little, For I shall not mourn him long. Tho' the life-cord was so brittle The love-cord was very strong. I would wake a little space Till I find a sleeping-place. You can go, I shall not weep; You can go unto your rest; My heart-ache is all too deep, And too sore my throbbing breast. Can sobs be, or angry tears, Where are neither hopes nor fears? Tho' with you I am alone, And must be so everywhere, I will make no useless moan; None shall say: “She could not bear;” While life lasts I will be strong, But I shall not struggle long. Listen, listen! everywhere A low voice is calling me, And a step is on the stair, And one comes ye do not see. Listen, listen! evermore A dim hand knocks at the door. Hear me: he is come again; My own dearest is come back. Bring him in from the cold rain; Bring wine, and let nothing lack. Thou and I will rest together, Love, until the sunny weather. I will shelter thee from harm, Hide thee from all heaviness; Come to me, and keep thee warm By my side in quietness. I will lull thee to thy sleep With sweet songs; we will not weep. Who hath talked of weeping? yet There is something at my heart Gnawing, I would fain forget, And an aching and a smart— Ah my Mother, 'tis in vain, For he is not come again. HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN. I did not chide him, tho' I knew That he was false to me: Chide the exhaling of the dew, The ebbing of the sea, The fading of a rosy hue, But not inconstancy. Why strive for love when love is o'er? Why bind a restive heart? He never knew the pain I bore In saying: “We must part; Let us be friends, and nothing more”:— Oh woman's shallow art! But it is over, it is done; I hardly heed it now; So many weary years have run Since then, I think not how Things might have been; but greet each one With an unruffled brow. What time I am where others be My heart seems very calm, Stone calm; but if all go from me There comes a vague alarm, A shrinking in the memory From some forgotten harm. And often thro' the long long night Waking when none are near, I feel my heart beat fast with fright, Yet know not what I fear. Oh how I long to see the light And the sweet birds to hear! To have the sun upon my face, To look up through the trees, To walk forth in the open space, And listen to the breeze, And not to dream the burial place Is clogging my weak knees. Sometimes I can nor weep nor pray, But am half stupified; And then all those who see me say Mine eyes are opened wide, And that my wits seem gone away:— Ah would that I had died! Would I could die and be at peace, Or living could forget; My grief nor grows nor doth decrease, But ever is:—and yet Methinks now that all this shall cease Before the sun shall set. Repining. She sat alway thro' the long day Spinning the weary thread away; And ever said in undertone: “Come; that I be no more alone.” From early dawn to set of sun Working, her task was still undone; And the long thread seemed to increase Even while she spun and did not cease. She heard the gentle turtle dove Tell to its mate a tale of love; She saw the glancing swallows fly, Ever a social company; She knew each bird upon its nest Had cheering songs to bring it rest; None lived alone, save only she; The wheel went round more wearily; She wept, and said in undertone: “Come; that I be no more alone.” Day followed day; and still she sighed For love, and was not satisfied; Until one night, when the moon-light Turned all the trees to silver white, She heard, what ne'er she heard before, A steady hand undo the door. The nightingale since set of sun Her throbbing music had not done, And she had listened silently; But now the wind had changed, and she Heard the sweet song no more, but heard Beside her bed a whispered word: “Damsel, rise up; be not afraid, “For I am come at last;” it said. She trembled tho' the voice was mild, She trembled like a frightened child, Till she looked up, and then she saw The unknown speaker without awe. He seemed a fair young man, his eyes Beaming with serious charities; His cheek was white, but hardly pale; And a dim glory, like a veil, Hovered about his head, and shone Thro' the whole room, till night was gone. So her fear fled; and then she said, Leaning upon her quiet bed: “Now thou art come I prithee stay, “That I may see thee in the day, “And learn to know thy voice, and hear “It evermore calling me near.” He answered: “Rise, and follow me.” But she looked upwards wonderingly: “And whither would'st thou go friend? stay “Until the dawning of the day.” But he said: “The wind ceaseth, Maid; “Of chill nor damp be thou afraid.” She bound her hair up from the floor, And passed in silence from the door. So they went forth together, he Helping her forward tenderly. The hedges bowed beneath his hand; Forth from the streams came the dry land As they passed over; evermore The pallid moonbeams shone before, And the wind hushed, and nothing stirred; Not even a solitary bird Scared by their footsteps fluttered by, Where aspen trees stood steadily. As they went on, at length a sound Came trembling on the air around; The undistinguishable hum Of life; voices that go and come Of busy men and the child's sweet High laugh, and noise of trampling feet. Then he said: “Wilt thou go and see?” And she made answer joyfully: “The noise of life, of human life, “Of dear communion without strife, “Of converse held 'twixt friend and friend; “Is it not here our path shall end?” He led her on a little way Until they reached a hillock: “Stay.” It was a village in a plain. High mountains screened it from the rain And stormy wind; and nigh at hand A bubbling streamlet flowed, o'er sand Pebbly and fine; and sent life up Green succous stalk and flower cup. Gradually, day's harbinger, A chilly wind began to stir. It seemed a gentle powerless breeze That scarcely rustled thro' the trees; And yet it touched the mountain's head, And the paths man might never tread. But hearken! in the quiet weather Do all the streams flow down together? No, 'tis a sound more terrible Than tho' a thousand rivers fell. The everlasting ice and snow Were loosened then, but not to flow; With a loud crash like solid thunder The avalanche came, burying under The village; turning life and breath And rest and joy and plans to death. “Oh let us fly, for pity fly, “Let us go hence friend, thou and I. “There must be many regions yet “Where these things make not desolate.” He looked upon her seriously; Then said: “Arise, and follow me.” The path that lay before them was Nigh covered over with long grass, And many slimy things and slow Trailed on between the roots below. The moon looked dimmer than before; And shadowy cloudlets floating o'er Its face, sometimes quite hid its light, And filled the skies with deeper night. At last, as they went on, the noise Was heard of the sea's mighty voice; And soon the ocean could be seen In its long restlessness serene. Upon its breast a vessel rode That drowsily appeared to nod As the great billows rose and fell, And swelled to sink, and sank to swell. Meanwhile the strong wind had come forth From the chill regions of the North; The mighty wind invisible. And the low waves began to swell; And the sky darkened overhead; And the moon once looked forth, then fled Behind dark clouds; while here and there The lightning shone out in the air; And the approaching thunder rolled With angry pealings manifold. How many vows were made; and prayers That in safe times were cold and scarce. Still all availed not; and at length The waves arose in all their strength, And fought against the ship, and filled The ship; then were the clouds unsealed, And the rains hurried forth and beat On every side and over it. Some clung together; and some kept A long stern silence; and some wept. Many, half crazed, looked on in wonder As the strong timbers rent asunder; Friends forgot friends; foes fled to foes; And still the water rose and rose. “Ah woe is me! whom I have seen “Are now as tho' they had not been. “In the earth there is room for birth, “And there are graves enough in earth; “Why should the cold sea, tempest torn, “Bury those whom it hath not borne?” He answered not, and they went on. The glory of the heavens was gone; The moon gleamed not, nor any Star; Cold winds were rustling near and far; And from the trees the dry leaves fell With a sad sound unspeakable. The air was cold; till from the South A gust blew hot like sudden drouth Into their faces, and a light Glowing and red shone thro' the night. A mighty city full of flame, And death, and sounds without a name! Amid the black and blinding smoke The people, as one man, awoke. Oh happy they who yesterday On the long journey went away; Whose pallid lips, smiling and chill, While the flames scorch them smile on still; Who murmur not, who tremble not When the bier crackles fiery hot; Who dying said in love's increase: “Lord, let Thy servant part in peace.” Those in the town could see and hear A shaded river flowing near. The broad deep bed could hardly hold Its plenteous waters calm and cold. Was flame wrapped all the city wall, The city gates were flame wrapped all. What was man's strength, what puissance then? Women were mighty as strong men. Some knelt in prayer believing still, Resigned unto a righteous will, Bowing beneath the chastening rod, Lost to the world, but found of God. Some prayed for friend, for child, for wife; Some prayed for faith; some prayed for life; While some, proud even in death, hope gone, Steadfast and still stood looking on. “Death, death! oh let us fly from death, “Where'er we go it followeth. “All these are dead; and we alone “Remain to weep for what is gone. “What is this thing, thus hurriedly “To pass into eternity? “To leave the earth so full of mirth? “To lose the profit of our birth? “To die and be no more? to cease, “Having numbness that is not peace? “Let us go hence: and even if thus “Death everywhere must go with us, “Let us not see the change, but see “Those who have been or still shall be.” He sighed, and they went on together. Beneath their feet did the grass wither; Across the heaven, high overhead, Dark misty clouds floated and fled; And in their bosom was the thunder; And angry lightnings flashed out under, Forkèd and red and menacing; Far off the wind was muttering; It seemed to tell, not understood, Strange secrets to the listening wood. Upon its wings it bore the scent Of blood of a great armament; Then saw they how on either side Fields were downtrodden far and wide; That morning at the break of day, Two nations had gone forth to slay. As a man soweth, so he reaps. The field was full of bleeding heaps; Ghastly corpses of men and horses That met death at a thousand sources; Cold limbs and putrifying flesh; Long love-locks clotted to a mesh That stifled; stiffened mouths beneath Staring eyes that had looked on death. But these were dead; these felt no more The anguish of the wounds they bore. Behold; they shall not sigh again, Nor justly fear, nor hope in vain. What if none wept above them; is The sleeper less at rest for this? Is not the young child's slumber sweet When no man watcheth over it? These had deep calm: but all around There was a deadly smothered sound, The choking cry of agony From wounded men who could not die. Who watched the black wing of the raven Rise like a cloud 'twixt them and heaven, And in the distance, flying fast, Beheld the eagle come at last. She knelt down in her agony: “O Lord, it is enough;” said she: “My heart's prayer putteth me to shame; “Let me return to whence I came. “Thou, Who for love's sake didst reprove, “Forgive me, for the sake of love.” NEW ENIGMAS. Name any gentleman you spy, And there's a chance that he is I; Go out to angle, and you may Catch me on a propitious day: Booted and spurred, their journey ended, The weary are by me befriended: If roasted meat should be your wish, I am more needful than a dish: I am acknowledgedly poor: Yet my resources are no fewer Than all the trades; there is not one But I profess, beneath the sun: I bear a part in many a game; My worth may change, I am the same. Sometimes, by you expelled, I roam Forth from the sanctuary of home. CHARADES. My first is no proof of my second, Though my second's a proof of my first: If I were my whole I should tell you Quite freely my best and my worst. One clue more: if you fail to discover My meaning, you're blind as a mole; But if you will frankly confess it, You show yourself clearly my whole. THE ROSE. O Rose, thou flower of flowers, thou fragrant wonder, Who shall describe thee in thy ruddy prime; Thy perfect fulness in the summer time; When the pale leaves blushingly part asunder And show the warm red heart lies glowing under? Thou shouldst bloom surely in some sunny clime, Untouched by blights and chilly Winter's rime, Where lightnings never flash, nor peals the thunder. And yet in happier spheres they cannot need thee So much as we do with our weight of woe; Perhaps they would not tend, perhaps not heed thee, And thou wouldst lonely and neglected grow; And He Who is All-Wise, He hath decreed thee To gladden earth and cheer all hearts below. The Trees' Counselling. I was strolling sorrowfully Thro' the corn fields and the meadows; The stream sounded melancholy, And I walked among the shadows; While the ancient forest trees Talked together in the breeze; In the breeze that waved and blew them, With a strange weird rustle thro' them. Said the oak unto the others In a leafy voice and pleasant: “Here we all are equal brothers, “Here we have nor lord nor peasant. “Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring, “Pass in happy following. “Little winds may whistle by us, “Little birds may overfly us; “But the sun still waits in heaven “To look down on us in splendour; “When he goes the moon is given, “Full of rays that he doth lend her: “And tho' sometimes in the night “Mists may hide her from our sight, “She comes out in the calm weather, “With the glorious stars together.” From the fruitage, from the blossom, From the trees came no denying; Then my heart said in my bosom: “Wherefore art thou sad and sighing? “Learn contentment from this wood “That proclaimeth all states good; “Go not from it as it found thee; “Turn thyself and gaze around thee.” And I turned: behold the shading But showed forth the light more clearly; The wild bees were honey-lading; The stream sounded hushing merely, And the wind not murmuring Seemed, but gently whispering: “Get thee patience; and thy spirit “Shall discern in all things merit.” “Behold, I stand at the door and knock.” Who standeth at the gate?—A woman old, A widow from the husband of her love: “O Lady, stay; this wind is piercing cold, Oh look at the keen frosty moon above; I have no home, am hungry, feeble, poor:”— “I'm really very sorry, but I can Do nothing for you, there's the clergyman,”— The Lady said, and shivering closed the door. Who standeth at the gate?—Way-worn and pale, A grey-haired man asks charity again: “Kind Lady, I have journeyed far, and fail Thro' weariness; for I have begged in vain Some shelter, and can find no lodging-place:”— She answered: “There's the Workhouse very near, Go, for they'll certainly receive you there:”— Then shut the door against his pleading face. Who standeth at the gate?—a stunted child, Her sunk eyes sharpened with precocious care: “O Lady, save me from a home defiled, From shameful sights and sounds that taint the air. Take pity on me, teach me something good;”— “For shame, why don't you work instead of cry?— I keep no young impostors here, not I;”— She slammed the door, indignant where she stood. Who standeth at the gate, and will be heard?— Arise, O woman, from thy comforts now: Go forth again to speak the careless word, The cruel word unjust, with hardened brow. But Who is This, That standeth not to pray As once, but terrible to judge thy sin? This, Whom thou wouldst not succour, nor take in, Nor teach, but leave to perish by the way?— “Thou didst it not unto the least of these, And in them hast not done it unto Me. Thou wast as a princess, rich and at ease, Now sit in dust and howl for poverty. Three times I stood beseeching at thy gate, Three times I came to bless thy soul and save: But now I come to judge for what I gave, And now at length thy sorrow is too late.” [Gianni my friend and I both strove to excel] Gianni my friend and I both strove to excel, But, missing better, settled down in well. Both fail, indeed; but not alike we fail— My forte being Venus' face, and his a dragon's tail. The Offering of the New Law, the One Oblation once Offered. “Sacrifice and Offering Thou wouldest not, but a BODY hast Thou prepared Me.” Once I thought to sit so high In the Palace of the sky; Now I thank God for His Grace, If I may fill the lowest place. Once I thought to scale so soon Heights above the changing moon; Now I thank God for delay— Today, it yet is called today. While I stumble, halt and blind, Lo! He waiteth to be kind; Bless me soon, or bless me slow, Except He bless, I let not go. Once for earth I laid my plan, Once I leaned on strength of man, When my hope was swept aside, I stayed my broken heart on pride: Broken reed hath pierced my hand; Fell my house I built on sand; Roofless, wounded, maimed by sin, Fightings without, and fears within: Yet, a tree, He feeds my root; Yet, a branch, He prunes for fruit; Yet, a sheep, these eves and morns, He seeks for me among the thorns. With Thine Image stamped of old, Find Thy coin more choice than gold; Known to Thee by name, recall To Thee Thy home-sick prodigal. Sacrifice and Offering None there is that I can bring; None, save what is Thine alone: I bring Thee, Lord, but of Thine Own— Broken Body, Blood Outpoured, These I bring, my God, my Lord; Wine of Life, and Living Bread, With these for me Thy Board is spread. The eleventh hour. Faint and worn and aged One stands knocking at a gate, Tho' no light shines in the casement, Knocking tho' so late. It has struck eleven In the courts of Heaven, Yet he still doth knock and wait. While no answer cometh From the heavenly hill, Blessed Angels wonder At his earnest will. Hope and fear but quicken While the shadows thicken; He is knocking knocking still. Grim the gate unopened Stands with bar and lock, Yet within the unseen Porter Hearkens to the knock. Doing and undoing, Faint and yet pursuing, This man's feet are on the Rock. With a cry unceasing Knocketh prayeth he:— “Lord, have mercy on me “When I cry to Thee.”— With a knock unceasing And a cry increasing:— “O my Lord, remember me.” Still the Porter standeth, Love-constrained He standeth near, While the cry increaseth Of that love and fear:— “Jesus look upon me; “Christ hast Thou foregone me? “If I must, I perish here.”— Faint the knocking ceases, Faint the cry and call: Is he lost indeed for ever, Shut without the wall?— Mighty Arms surround him, Arms that sought and found him, Held withheld and bore thro' all.— O celestial mansion Open wide the door: Crown and robes of whiteness, Stone inscribed before, Flocking Angels bear them; Stretch thy hand and wear them, Sit thou down for evermore. I know you not. O Christ the Vine with living Fruit, The twelvefold fruited Tree of Life, The Balm in Gilead after strife, The valley Lily and the Rose: Stronger than Lebanon, Thou Root, Sweeter than clustered grapes, Thou Vine; Oh Best, Thou Vineyard of red Wine Keeping Thy best Wine till the close. Pearl of great price Thyself alone And ruddier than the ruby Thou, Most precious lightening Jasper Stone, Head of the corner spurned before; Fair Gate of pearl, Thyself the Door, Clear golden Street, Thyself the Way, By Thee we journey toward Thee now Thro' Thee shall enter Heaven one day. I thirst for Thee, full Fount and Flood, My heart calls Thine as deep to deep: Dost Thou forget Thy sweat and pain, Thy provocation on the Cross? Heart pierced for me, vouchsafe to keep The purchase of Thy lavished Blood; The gain is Thine Lord if I gain, Or if I lose Thine Own the loss. At midnight, saith the parable, A cry was made, the Bridegroom came: Those who were ready entered in; The rest shut out in death and shame Strove all too late that feast to win Their die was cast and fixed their lot, A gulph divided heaven from hell, The Bridegroom said, ‘I know you not.’ But Who is This That shuts the door And saith ‘I know you not’ to them? I see the wounded Hands and Side, The Brow thorn-tortured long ago: Yea, This Who grieved and bled and died, This Same is He Who must condemn; He called, but they refused to know, So now He hears their cry no more. A Christmas Carol. Before the paling of the stars Before the winter morn Before the earliest cockcrow Jesus Christ was born: Born in a stable Cradled in a manger, In the world His Hands had made Born a Stranger. Priest and King lay fast asleep In Jerusalem, Young and Old lay fast asleep In crowded Bethlehem: Saint and Angel Ox and Ass Kept a watch together Before the Christmas daybreak In the winter weather. Jesus on His Mother's breast In the stable cold, Spotless Lamb of God was He Shepherd of the Fold: Let us kneel with Mary Maid With Joseph bent and hoary With Saint and Angel Ox and Ass To hail the King of Glory. Easter Even. There is nothing more that they can do For all their rage and boast; Caiaphas with his blaspheming crew, Herod with his host, Pontius Pilate in his judgment hall Judging their Judge and his, Or he who led them all and passed them all Arch-Judas with his kiss. The sepulchre made sure with ponderous stone Seal that same stone, O priest; It may be thou shalt block the Holy One From rising in the east: Set a watch about the sepulchre To watch on pain of death; They must hold fast the stone if One should stir And shake it from beneath. God Almighty He can break a seal, And roll away a stone; Can grind the proud in dust who would not kneel, And crush the mighty one. There is nothing more that they can do For all their passionate care, Those who sit in dust, the blessed few, And weep and rend their hair. Peter, Thomas, Mary Magdalen, The Virgin unreproved, Joseph with Nicodemus foremost men, And John the well-beloved. Bring your finest linen and your spice, Swathe the Sacred Dead, Bind with careful hands and piteous eyes The napkin round His Head; Lay Him in the garden rock to rest; Rest you the Sabbath length: The Sun That went down crimson in the west Shall rise renewed in strength. God Almighty shall give joy for pain, Shall comfort him who grieves: Lo, He with joy shall doubtless come again And with Him bring His sheaves. Come unto Me. Oh for the time gone by when thought of Christ Made His yoke easy and His burden light; When my heart stirred within me at the sight Of Altar spread for awful Eucharist; When all my hopes His promises sufficed; When my soul watched for Him by day by night; When my lamp lightened, and my robe was white, And all seemed loss except the Pearl unpriced. Yet since He calls me still with tender call, Since He remembers Whom I half forgot, I even will run my race and bear my lot: For Faith the walls of Jericho cast down, And Hope to whoso runs holds forth a crown, And Love is Christ, and Christ is All in all. Ash Wednesday. Jesus, do I love Thee? Thou art far above me, Seated out of sight Hid in heavenly light Of most highest height. Martyred hosts implore Thee, Seraphs fall before Thee, Angels and Archangels, Cherub throngs adore Thee; Blessed she that bore Thee!— All the Saints approve Thee, All the Virgins love Thee. I show as a blot Blood hath cleansed not, As a barren spot In Thy fruitful lot. I, figtree fruit-unbearing, Thou, Righteous Judge unsparing: What canst Thou do more to me That shall not more undo me? Thy Justice hath a sound: “Why cumbereth it the ground?” Thy Love with stirrings stronger Pleads: “Give it one year longer.” Thou giv'st me time: but who Save Thou, shall give me dew, Shall feed my root with Blood And stir my sap for good?— Oh by Thy gifts that shame me Give more lest they condemn me: Good Lord, I ask much of Thee, But most I ask to love Thee: Kind Lord, be mindful of me, Love me and make me love Thee. SPRING FANCIES. I. Gone were but the Winter, Come were but the Spring, I would go to a covert Where the birds sing Ding ding, ding a ding. Where in the whitethorn Singeth the thrush, And the robin sings In a holly bush With his breast ablush. Full of fresh scents Are the budding boughs, Arching high over A cool green house Where doves coo the arouse. There the sun shineth Most shadily; There sounds an echo Of the far sea, Tho' far off it be. II. All the world is out in leaf, Half the world in flower, Faint the rainbow comes and goes In a sunny shower; Earth has waited weeks and weeks For this special hour. All the world is making love; Bird to bird in bushes, Beast to beast in glades, and frog To frog among the rushes: Wake, O south wind sweet with spice Wake the rose to blushes. All the world is full of change; Tomorrow may be dreary: Life breaks forth, to right and left Pipe the woodnotes cheery— Nevertheless there lie the dead Fast asleep and weary— III. If it's weary work to live, It will rest us to lie dead, With a stone at the tired feet And a stone at the tired head. In the waxing April days Half the world will stir and sing, But half the world will slug and rot For all the sap of spring. “LAST NIGHT.” Where were you last night? I watched at the gate; I went down early, I stayed down late. Were you snug at home, I should like to know, Or were you in the coppice wheedling Kate? She's a fine girl, with a fine clear skin; Easy to woo, perhaps not hard to win. Speak up like a man and tell me the truth: I'm not one to grow downhearted and thin. If you love her best speak up like a man; It's not I will stand in the light of your plan: Some girls might cry and scold you a bit And say they couldn't bear it; but I can. Love was pleasant enough, and the days went fast; Pleasant while it lasted, but it needn't last; Awhile on the wax and awhile on the wane, Now dropped away into the past. Was it pleasant to you? to me it was; Now clean gone as an image from glass, As a goodly rainbow that fades away, As dew that steams upwards from the grass, As the first spring day, or the last summer day, As the sunset flush that leaves heaven grey, As a flame burnt out for lack of oil Which no pains relight or ever may. Good luck to Kate and good luck to you, I guess she'll be kind when you come to woo; I wish her a pretty face that will last, I wish her a husband steady and true. Hate you? not I, my very good friend; All things begin and all have an end. But let broken be broken; I put no faith In quacks who set up to patch and mend. Just my love and one word to Kate: Not to let time slip if she means to mate;— For even such a thing has been known As to miss the chance while we weigh and wait. PETER GRUMP. If underneath the water You comb your golden hair With a golden comb, my daughter, Oh, would that I were there. If underneath the wave You fill a slimy grave, Would that I, who could not save, Might share.FORSS. If my love Hero queens it In summer Fairyland, What would I be But the ring on her hand? Her cheek when she leans it Would lean on me:— Or sweet, bitter-sweet, The flower that she wore When we parted, to meet On the hither shore Anymore? nevermore. Helen Grey. Because one loves you, Helen Grey, Is that a reason you should pout And like a March wind veer about And frown and say your shrewish say? Don't strain the cord until it snaps, Don't split the sound heart with your wedge, Don't cut your fingers with the edge Of your keen wit: you may perhaps. Because you're handsome, Helen Grey, Is that a reason to be proud? Your eyes are bold, your laugh is loud, Your steps go mincing on their way: But so you miss that modest charm Which is the surest charm of all; Take heed; you yet may trip and fall, And no man care to stretch his arm. Stoop from your cold height, Helen Grey, Come down and take a lowlier place; Come down to fill it now with grace; Come down you must perforce some day: For years cannot be kept at bay, And fading years will make you old; Then in their turn will men seem cold, When you yourself are nipped and grey. If. If he would come today today today, Oh what a day today would be; But now he's away, miles and miles away From me across the sea. O little bird flying flying flying To your nest in the warm west, Tell him as you pass that I am dying, As you pass home to your nest. I have a sister, I have a brother, A faithful hound, a tame white dove; But I had another, once I had another, And I miss him my love, my love. In this weary world it is so cold so cold While I sit here all alone I would not like to wait and to grow old But just to be dead and gone. Make me fair when I lie dead on my bed, Fair where I am lying; Perhaps he may come and look upon me dead He for whom I am dying. Dig my grave for two with a stone to show it And on the stone write my name: If he never comes I shall never know it But sleep on all the same. Seasons. Oh the cheerful budding-time When thorn-hedges turn to green; When new leaves of elm and lime Cleave and shed their winter screen: Tender lambs are born and baa, North wind finds no snow to bring, Vigorous nature laughs Haha In the miracle of spring. Oh the gorgeous blossom-days When broad flag-flowers drink and blow; In and out in summer blaze Dragonflies flash to and fro: Ashen branches hang out keys, Oaks put forth the rosy shoot, Wandering herds wax sleek at ease, Lovely blossoms end in fruit. Oh the shouting harvest-weeks: Mother Earth grown fat with sheaves; Thrifty gleaner finds who seeks: Russet golden pomp of leaves Crowns the woods, to fall at length; Bracing winds are felt to stir, Ocean gathers up her strength, Beasts renew their dwindled fur. Oh the starving winter-lapse, Ice-bound, hunger-pinched and dim: Dormant roots recal their saps, Empty nests show black and grim, Short-lived sunshine gives no heat, Undue buds are nipped by frost, Snow sets forth a windingsheet And all hope of life seems lost. HENRY HARDIMAN, Aged 55. Affliction sore long time he bore, Physicians were in vain, Till God did please his soul release, And ease him of his pain. Within the Veil. She holds a lily in her hand, Where long ranks of Angels stand; A silver lily for her wand. All her hair falls sweeping down, Her hair that is a golden brown; A crown beneath her golden crown. Blooms a rose-bush at her knee, Good to smell and good to see; It bears a rose for her, for me: Her rose a blossom richly grown, My rose a bud not fully blown But sure one day to be mine own. Paradise: in a Symbol. Golden-winged, silver-winged, Winged with flashing flame, Such a flight of birds I saw, Birds without a name: Singing songs in their own tongue (Song of songs) they came. One to another calling, Each answering each, One to another calling In their proper speech: High above my head they wheeled, Far out of reach. On wings of flame they went and came With a cadenced clang, Their silver wings tinkled, Their golden wings rang, The wind it whistled thro' their wings Where in heaven they sang. They flashed and they darted Awhile before mine eyes, Mounting mounting mounting still In haste to scale the skies, Birds without a nest on earth, Birds of Paradise. Where the moon riseth not Nor sun seeks the west, There to sing their glory Which they sing at rest, There to sing their love-song When they sing their best: Not in any garden That mortal foot hath trod, Not in any flowering tree That springs from earthly sod, But in the garden where they dwell The Paradise of God. [In July] In July No goodbye; In Augùst Part we must. [Love hath a name of Death] Love hath a name of Death: He gives a breath And takes away. Lo we beneath his sway Grow like a flower; To bloom an hour, To droop a day, And fade away. [Alas my Lord] Alas my Lord, How should I wrestle all the livelong night With Thee my God, my Strength and my Delight? How can it need So agonized an effort and a strain To make Thy Face of Mercy shine again? How can it need Such wringing out of breathless prayer to move Thee to Thy wonted Love, when Thou art Love? Yet Abraham So hung about Thine Arm outstretched and bared, That for ten righteous Sodom had been spared. Yet Jacob did So hold Thee by the clenched hand of prayer That he prevailed, and Thou didst bless him there. Elias prayed, And sealed the founts of Heaven; he prayed again And lo, Thy Blessing fell in showers of rain. Gulped by the fish, As by the pit, lost Jonah made his moan; And Thou forgavest, waiting to atone. All Nineveh Fasting and girt in sackcloth raised a cry, Which moved Thee ere the day of grace went by. Thy Church prayed on And on for blessed Peter in his strait, Till opened of its own accord the gate. Yea, Thou my God Hast prayed all night, and in the garden prayed Even while, like melting wax, Thy strength was made. Alas for him Who faints, despite Thy Pattern, King of Saints: Alas, alas, for me, the one that faints. Lord, give us strength To hold Thee fast, until we hear Thy Voice Which Thine own know, who hearing It rejoice. Lord, give us strength To hold Thee fast until we see Thy Face, Full Fountain of all Rapture and all Grace. But when our strength Shall be made weakness, and our bodies clay, Hold Thou us fast, and give us sleep till day. AN ALPHABET. A is the Alphabet, A at its head; A is an Antelope, agile to run.

He'd been away a month and day Counting from morn to morn: And many buds had turned to leaves And many lambs were born And many buds had turned to flowers For Spring was in a glow, When she was laid upon her bed As white and cold as snow. “Oh let me kiss my baby once, “Once before I die; “And bring it sometimes to my grave “To teach it where I lie. “And tell my husband when he comes “Safe home from sea, “To love the baby that I leave “If ever he loved me: “And tell him, not for might or right “Or forsworn marriage vow “But for the helpless baby's sake, “I would have kissed him now.” MICHAEL F. M. ROSSETTI. Born April 22nd, 1881; Died January 24th, 1883. A holy Innocent gone home Without so much as one sharp wounding word: A blessed Michael in heaven's lofty dome Without a sword. Brief dawn and noon and setting time! Our rapid-rounding moon has fled: A black eclipse before the prime Has swallowed up that shining head. Eternity holds up her lookingglass:— The eclipse of Time will pass, And all that lovely light return to sight. I watch the showers and think of flowers: Alas, my flower that shows no fruit! My snowdrop plucked, my daisy shoot Plucked from the root. Soon Spring will shower, the world will flower, A world of buds will promise fruit, Pear trees will shoot and apples shoot Sound at the root. Bud of an hour, far off you flower; My bud, far off you ripen fruit; My prettiest bud, my straightest shoot Sweet at the root. The youngest bud of five, The least lamb of the fold,— Bud not to blossom, yet to thrive Away from cold. Lamb which we shall not see Leap at its pretty pranks, Our lamb at rest and full of glee On heavenly banks. A SICK CHILD'S MEDITATION Pain and weariness, aching eyes and head, Pain and weariness all the day and night: Yet the pillow's soft on my smooth soft bed, And fresh air blows in, and mother shades the light. Thou, O Lord, in pain hadst no pillow soft, In Thy weary pain, in Thine agony: But a cross of shame held Thee up aloft Where Thy very mother could do nought for Thee. I would gaze on Thee, on Thy patient face; Make me like Thyself, patient, sweet, at peace; Make my days all love, and my nights all praise, Till all days and nights and patient sufferings cease. [Love is all happiness, love is all beauty] Love is all happiness, love is all beauty, Love is the crown of flaxen heads and hoary, Love is the only everlasting duty, And love is chronicled in endless story And kindles endless glory. [A handy Mole who plied no shovel] A handy Mole who plied no shovel To excavate his vaulted hovel, While hard at work met in mid-furrow An Earthworm boring out his burrow. Our Mole had dined and must grow thinner Before he gulped a second dinner, And on no other terms cared he To meet a worm of low degree. The Mole turned on his blindest eye Passing that base mechanic by; The Worm entrenched in actual blindness Ignored or kindness or unkindness; Each wrought his own exclusive tunnel To reach his own exclusive funnel. A plough its flawless track pursuing Involved them in one common ruin. Where now the mine and countermine, The dined-on and the one to dine? The impartial ploughshare of extinction Annulled them all without distinction. “One swallow does not make a summer.” A Rose which spied one swallow Made haste to blush and blow: “Others are sure to follow:” Ah no, not so! The wandering clouds still owe A few fresh flakes of snow, Chill fog must fill the hollow, Before the bird-stream flow In flood across the main And winter's woe End in glad summer come again. Then thousand flowers may blossom by the shore, But that Rose never more. [Contemptuous of his home beyond] Contemptuous of his home beyond The village and the village pond, A large-souled Frog who spurned each byeway, Hopped along the imperial highway. Nor grunting pig nor barking dog Could disconcert so great a frog. The morning dew was lingering yet His sides to cool, his tongue to wet; The night dew when the night should come A travelled frog would send him home. Not so, alas! the wayside grass Sees him no more:—not so, alas! A broadwheeled waggon unawares Ran him down, his joys, his cares. From dying choke one feeble croak The Frog's perpetual silence broke: “Ye buoyant Frogs, ye great and small, Even I am mortal after all. My road to Fame turns out a wry way: I perish on this hideous highway,— Oh for my old familiar byeway!” The choking Frog sobbed and was gone: The waggoner strode whistling on. Unconscious of the carnage done, Whistling that waggoner strode on, Whistling (it may have happened so) “A Froggy would a-wooing go:” A hypothetic frog trolled he Obtuse to a reality. O rich and poor, O great and small, Such oversights beset us all: The mangled frog abides incog, The uninteresting actual frog; The hypothetic frog alone Is the one frog we dwell upon. A Word for the Dumb. Pity the sorrows of a poor old Dog Who wags his tail a-begging in his need: Despise not even the sorrows of a Frog, God's creature too, and that's enough to plead: Spare Puss who trusts us purring on our hearth: Spare Bunny once so frisky and so free: Spare all the harmless tenants of the earth: Spare, and be spared:—or who shall plead for thee? CARDINAL NEWMAN. “In the grave, whither thou goest.” O weary Champion of the Cross, lie still: Sleep thou at length the all-embracing sleep: Long was thy sowing day, rest now and reap: Thy fast was long, feast now thy spirit's fill. Yea, take thy fill of love, because thy will Chose love not in the shallows but the deep: Thy tides were springtides, set against the neap Of calmer souls: thy flood rebuked their rill. Now night has come to thee—please God, of rest: So some time must it come to every man; To first and last, where many last are first. Now fixed and finished thine eternal plan, Thy best has done its best, thy worst its worst: Thy best its best, please God, thy best its best. An Echo from Willowwood. “O ye, all ye that walk in Willowwood.” D. G. Rossetti. Two gazed into a pool, he gazed and she, Not hand in hand, yet heart in heart, I think, Pale and reluctant on the water's brink, As on the brink of parting which must be. Each eyed the other's aspect, she and he, Each felt one hungering heart leap up and sink, Each tasted bitterness which both must drink, There on the brink of life's dividing sea. Lilies upon the surface, deep below Two wistful faces craving each for each, Resolute and reluctant without speech:— A sudden ripple made the faces flow One moment joined, to vanish out of reach: So those hearts joined, and ah! were parted so. “YEA, I HAVE A GOODLY HERITAGE.” My vineyard that is mine I have to keep, Pruning for fruit the pleasant twigs and leaves. Tend thou thy cornfield: one day thou shalt reap In joy thy ripened sheaves. Or if thine be an orchard, graft and prop Food-bearing trees each watered in its place: Or if a garden, let it yield for crop Sweet herbs and herb of grace. But if my lot be sand where nothing grows?— Nay, who hath said it? Tune a thankful psalm: For tho' thy desert bloom not as the rose, It yet can rear thy palm. A Death of a First-born. January 14th, 1892. One young life lost, two happy young lives blighted, With earthward eyes we see: With eyes uplifted, keener, farther-sighted, We look, O Lord, to Thee. Grief hears a funeral knell: hope hears the ringing Of birthday bells on high; Faith, hope, and love make answer with soft singing, Half carol and half cry. Stoop to console us, Christ, Sole Consolation, While dust returns to dust; Until that blessed day when all Thy Nation Shall rise up of the Just. “FAINT, YET PURSUING.” 1. Beyond this shadow and this turbulent sea, Shadow of death and turbulent sea of death, Lies all we long to have or long to be:— Take heart, tired man, toil on with lessening breath, Lay violent hands on heaven's high treasury, Be what you long to be thro' life-long scathe: A little while hope leans on charity, A little while charity heartens faith. A little while: and then what further while? One while that ends not and that wearies not, For ever new whilst evermore the same: All things made new bear each a sweet new name; Man's lot of death has turned to life his lot, And tearful charity to love's own smile. 2. Press onward, quickened souls, who mounting move, Press onward, upward, fire with mounting fire; Gathering volume of untold desire Press upward, homeward, dove with mounting dove. Point me the excellent way that leads above; Woo me with sequent will, me too to aspire; With sequent heart to follow higher and higher, To follow all who follow on to love. Up the high steep, across the golden sill, Up out of shadows into very light, Up out of dwindling life to life aglow, I watch you, my beloved, out of sight;— Sight fails me, and my heart is watching still: My heart fails, yet I follow on to know. [What will it be, O my soul, what will it be] What will it be, O my soul, what will it be To touch the long-raced-for goal, to handle and see, To rest in the joy of joys, in the joy of the blest, To rest and revive and rejoice, to rejoice and to rest! [Lord, Thou art fulness, I am emptiness] Lord, Thou art fulness, I am emptiness: Yet hear my heart speak in its speechlessness Extolling Thine unuttered loveliness. [O Lord, I cannot plead my love of Thee] O Lord, I cannot plead my love of Thee: I plead Thy love of me;— The shallow conduit hails the unfathomed sea. [Faith and Hope are wings to Love] Faith and Hope are wings to Love, Silver wings to golden dove. A SORROWFUL SIGH OF A PRISONER. Lord, comest Thou to me? My heart is cold and dead: Alas that such a heart should be The place to lay Thy head! [“I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow”—] “I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow”— Yea, scarlet woman, today: but not yea at all tomorrow. Scarlet queen on a scarlet throne all today without sorrow, Bethink thee: today must end; there is no end of tomorrow. [Passing away the bliss] Passing away the bliss, The anguish passing away: Thus it is Today. Clean past away the sorrow, The pleasure brought back to stay: Thus and this Tomorrow. [Love builds a nest on earth and waits for rest] Love builds a nest on earth and waits for rest, Love sends to heaven the warm heart from its breast, Looks to be blest and is already blest, And testifies: “God's Will is alway best.” [Jesus alone:—if thus it were to me] Jesus alone:—if thus it were to me; Yet thus it cannot be; Lord, I have all things if I have but Thee. Jesus and all:—precious His bounties are, Yet He more precious far; Day's-eyes are many, one the Morning Star. Jesus my all:—so let me rest in love, Thy peaceable poor dove, Some time below till timeless time above. The Way of the World. A boat that sails upon the sea; Sails far and far and far away: Who sail in her sing songs of glee, Or watch and pray. A boat that drifts upon the sea Silent and void to sun and air: Who sailed in her have ended glee And watch and prayer. BOOKS IN THE RUNNING BROOKS. “It is enough, enough,” one said, At play among the flowers: “I spy a rose upon the thorn, A rainbow in the showers; I hear a merry chime of bells Ring out the passing hours.”— Soft springs the fountain From the daisied ground: Softly falling on the moss Without a sound. “It is enough,” she said, and fixed Calm eyes upon the sky: “I watch a flitting tender cloud Just like a dove go by; A lark is rising from the grass; A wren is building nigh.”— Softly the fountain Threads its silver way, Screened by the scented bloom Of whitest may. “Enough?” she whispered to herself, As doubting: “Is it so? Enough to wear the roses fair? Oh sweetest flowers that blow:— Oh yes, it surely is enough, My happy home below.”— A shadow stretcheth From the hither shore: Those waters darken More and more and more. “It is enough,” she says; but with A listless, weary moan: “Enough,” if mixing with her friends; “Enough,” if left alone. But to herself: “Not yet enough, This suffering, to atone?”— The cold black waters Seem to stagnate there; Without a single wave, Or breath of air. And now she says: “It is enough,” Half languid and half stirred: “Enough,” to silence and to sound, Thorn, blossom, soaring bird: “Enough,” she says; but with a lack Of something in the word.— Defiled and turbid See the waters pass; Half light, half shadow, Struggling thro' the grass. Ah, will it ever dawn, that day When calm for good or ill Her heart shall say: “It is enough, For Thou art with me still; It is enough, O Lord my God, Thine only blessed Will.”— Then shall the fountain sing And flow to rest; Clear as the sun track To the purple West. GONE BEFORE She was most like a rose, when it flushes rarest; She was most like a lily, when it blows fairest; She was most like a violet, sweetest on the bank: Now she's only like the snow cold and blank After the sun sank. She left us in the early days, she would not linger For orange blossoms in her hair, or ring on finger: Did she deem windy grass more good than these? Now the turf that's between us and the hedging trees Might as well be seas. I had trained a branch she shelters not under, I had reared a flower she snapped asunder: In the bush and on the stately bough Birds sing; she who watched them track the plough Cannot hear them now. Every bird has a nest hidden somewhere For itself and its mate and joys that come there, Tho' it soar to the clouds, finding there its rest: You sang in the height, but no more with eager breast Stoop to your own nest. If I could win you back from heaven-gate lofty, Perhaps you would but grieve returning softly: Surely they would miss you in the blessed throng, Miss your sweet voice in their sweetest song, Reckon time too long. Earth is not good enough for you, my sweet, my sweetest; Life on earth seemed long to you tho' to me fleetest. I would not wish you back if a wish would do: Only love I long for heaven with you Heart-pierced thro' and thro'. II Privately Printed Poems THE DEAD CITY. Once I rambled in a wood With a careless hardihood, Heeding not the tangled way; Labyrinths around me lay, But for them I never stood. On, still on, I wandered on, And the sun above me shone; And the birds around me winging With their everlasting singing Made me feel not quite alone. In the branches of the trees, Murmured like the hum of bees The low sound of happy breezes, Whose sweet voice that never ceases Lulls the heart to perfect ease. Streamlets bubbled all around On the green and fertile ground, Thro' the rushes and the grass, Like a sheet of liquid glass, With a soft and trickling sound. And I went, I went on faster, Contemplating no disaster; And I plucked ripe blackberries, But the birds with envious eyes Came and stole them from their master: For the birds here were all tame; Some with bodies like a flame, Some that glanced the branches thro' Pure and colourless as dew; Fearlessly to me they came. Before me no mortal stood In the mazes of that wood; Before me the birds had never Seen a man, but dwelt for ever In a happy solitude; Happy solitude, and blest With beatitude of rest; Where the woods are ever vernal, And the life and joy eternal, Without Death's or Sorrow's test. Oh most blessed solitude! Oh most full beatitude! Where are quiet without strife, And imperishable life, Nothing marred, and all things good. And the bright sun, life begetting, Never rising, never setting, Shining warmly overhead, Nor too pallid, nor too red, Lulled me to a sweet forgetting, Sweet forgetting of the time: And I listened for no chime Which might warn me to begone; But I wandered on, still on, 'Neath the boughs of oak and lime. Know I not how long I strayed In the pleasant leafy shade; But the trees had gradually Grown more rare, the air more free, The sun hotter overhead. Soon the birds no more were seen Glancing thro' the living green; And a blight had passed upon All the trees; and the pale sun Shone with a strange lurid sheen. Then a darkness spread around: I saw nought, I heard no sound; Solid darkness overhead, With a trembling cautious tread Passed I o'er the unseen ground. But at length a pallid light Broke upon my searching sight; A pale solitary ray, Like a star at dawn of day Ere the sun is hot and bright. Towards its faintly glimmering beam I went on as in a dream; A strange dream of hope and fear! And I saw as I drew near 'Twas in truth no planet's gleam; But a lamp above a gate Shone in solitary state O'er a desert drear and cold, O'er a heap of ruins old, O'er a scene most desolate. By that gate I entered lone A fair city of white stone; And a lovely light to see Dawned, and spread most gradually Till the air grew warm and shone. Thro' the splendid streets I strayed In that radiance without shade, Yet I heard no human sound; All was still and silent round As a city of the dead. All the doors were open wide; Lattices on every side In the wind swung to and fro; Wind that whispered very low: Go and see the end of pride. With a fixed determination Entered I each habitation, But they all were tenantless; All was utter loneliness, All was deathless desolation. In the noiseless market-place Was no care-worn busy face; There were none to buy or sell, None to listen or to tell, In this silent emptiness. Thro' the city on I went Full of awe and wonderment; Still the light around me shone, And I wandered on, still on, In my great astonishment, Till at length I reached a place Where amid an ample space Rose a palace for a king; Golden was the turreting, And of solid gold the base. The great porch was ivory, And the steps were ebony; Diamond and chrysoprase Set the pillars in a blaze, Capitalled with jewelry. None was there to bar my way— And the breezes seemed to say: Touch not these, but pass them by, Pressing onwards: therefore I Entered in and made no stay. All around was desolate: I went on; a silent state Reigned in each deserted room, And I hastened thro' the gloom Till I reached an outer gate. Soon a shady avenue Blossom-perfumed, met my view. Here and there the sun-beams fell On pure founts, whose sudden swell Up from marble basins flew. Every tree was fresh and green; Not a withered leaf was seen Thro' the veil of flowers and fruit; Strong and sapful were the root, The top boughs, and all between. Vines were climbing everywhere Full of purple grapes and fair: And far off I saw the corn With its heavy head down borne, By the odour-laden air. Who shall strip the bending vine? Who shall tread the press for wine? Who shall bring the harvest in When the pallid ears begin In the sun to glow and shine? On I went, alone, alone, Till I saw a tent that shone With each bright and lustrous hue; It was trimmed with jewels too, And with flowers; not one was gone. Then the breezes whispered me: Enter in, and look, and see How for luxury and pride A great multitude have died:— And I entered tremblingly. Lo, a splendid banquet laid In the cool and pleasant shade. Mighty tables, every thing Of sweet Nature's furnishing That was rich and rare, displayed; And each strange and luscious cate Practised Art makes delicate; With a thousand fair devices Full of odours and of spices; And a warm voluptuous state. All the vessels were of gold Set with gems of worth untold. In the midst a fountain rose Of pure milk, whose rippling flows In a silver basin rolled. In green emerald baskets were Sun-red apples, streaked, and fair; Here the nectarine and peach And ripe plum lay, and on each The bloom rested every where. Grapes were hanging overhead, Purple, pale, and ruby-red; And in panniers all around Yellow melons shone, fresh found, With the dew upon them spread. And the apricot and pear And the pulpy fig were there; Cherries and dark mulberries, Bunchy currants, strawberries, And the lemon wan and fair. And unnumbered others too, Fruits of every size and hue, Juicy in their ripe perfection, Cool beneath the cool reflection Of the curtains' skyey blue. All the floor was strewn with flowers Fresh from sunshine and from showers, Roses, lilies, jessamine; And the ivy ran between Like a thought in happy hours. And this feast too lacked no guest With its warm delicious rest; With its couches softly sinking, And its glow, not made for thinking, But for careless joy at best. Many banquetters were there, Wrinkled age, the young, the fair; In the splendid revelry Flushing cheek and kindling eye Told of gladness without care. Yet no laughter rang around, Yet they uttered forth no sound; With the smile upon his face Each sat moveless in his place, Silently, as if spell-bound. The low whispering voice was gone, And I felt awed and alone. In my great astonishment To the feasters up I went— Lo, they all were turned to stone. Yea they all were statue-cold, Men and women, young and old; With the life-like look and smile And the flush; and all the while The hard fingers kept their hold. Here a little child was sitting With a merry glance, befitting Happy age and heedless heart; There a young man sat apart With a forward look unweeting. Nigh them was a maiden fair; And the ringlets of her hair Round her slender fingers twined; And she blushed as she reclined, Knowing that her love was there. Here a dead man sat to sup, In his hand a drinking cup; Wine cup of the heavy gold, Human hand stony and cold, And no life-breath struggling up. There a mother lay, and smiled Down upon her infant child; Happy child and happy mother Laughing back to one another With a gladness undefiled. Here an old man slept, worn out With the revelry and rout; Here a strong man sat and gazed On a girl, whose eyes upraised No more wandered round about. And none broke the stillness, none; I was the sole living one. And methought that silently Many seemed to look on me With strange stedfast eyes that shone. Full of fear I would have fled; Full of fear I bent my head, Shutting out each stony guest:— When I looked again the feast And the tent had vanished. Yes, once more I stood alone Where the happy sunlight shone And a gentle wind was sighing, And the little birds were flying, And the dreariness was gone. All these things that I have said Awed me, and made me afraid. What was I that I should see So much hidden mystery? And I straightway knelt and prayed. The Water Spirit's Song. In the silent hour of even, When the stars are in the heaven, When in the azure cloudless sky The moon beams forth all lustrously, When over hill and over vale Is wafted the sweet-scented gale, When murmurs thro' the forest trees The cool, refreshing, evening breeze, When the nightingale's wild melody Is waking herb and flower and tree, From their perfumed and soft repose, To list the praises of the rose; When the ocean sleeps deceitfully, When the waves are resting quietly, I spread my bright wings, and fly far away To my beautiful sister's mansion gay: I leave behind me rock and mountain, I leave behind me rill and fountain, And I dive far down in the murmuring sea, Where my fair sister welcomes me joyously; For she's Queen of Ocean for ever and ever, And I of each fountain and still lake and river. She dwells in a palace of coral Of diamond and pearl; And in each jewelled chamber the fishes Their scaly length unfurl; And the sun can dart no light On the depths beneath the sea; But the ruby there shines bright And sparkles brilliantly; No mortal e'er trod on the surface Of the adamantine floor; No human being e'er passed the bound Of the pearl-encrusted door. But the mermaidens sing plaintively Beneath the deep blue ocean, And to their song the green fishes dance With undulating motion. And the cold bright moon looks down on us With her fixed unchanging smile; 'Neath her chilly glance the mermaids dance Upon each coral isle; And her beams she laves in the briny waves With loving constancy; And she never ceases with light caresses To soothe the swelling sea; All night on us she softly shines With a fond and tender gaze, Till the sun blushes red from his ocean bed And sends forth his warming rays. And then she flies to other skies Till the sun has run his race, And again the day to the night's soft sway To the moon and stars gives place. And when the bright sun doth arise, To tinge with gold the vaulted skies, When the nightingale no longer sings, And the blush rose forth its odour flings, When the breath of morn is rustling through The trees, and kissing away the dew, When the sea casts up its foam and spray, And greets the fresh gale that speeds away, I fly back to my home in the rushing cascade— By the silvery streamlet my dark hair I braid, And then when the sun once more sinks in the ocean, I glide with a floating and passionless motion, To my sister 'neath the boundless sea And with her till morn dwell joyously. The Song of the Star. I am a star dwelling on high In the azure of the vaulted sky. I shine on the land and I shine on the sea, And the little breezes talk to me. The waves rise towards me every one And forget the brightness of the sun: The growing grass springs up towards me And forgets the day's fertility. My face is light, and my beam is life, And my passionless being hath no strife. In me no love is turned to hate, No fulness is made desolate; Here is no hope, no fear, no grief, Here is no pain and no relief; Nor birth nor death hath part in me, But a profound tranquillity. The blossoms that bloomed yesterday Unaltered shall bloom on today, And on the morrow shall not fade. Within the everlasting shade The fountain gushing up for ever Flows on to the eternal river, That, running by a reedy shore, Bubbles, bubbles evermore. The happy birds sing in the trees To the music of the southern breeze; And they fear no lack of food, Chirping in the underwood; For ripe seeds and berried bushes Serve the finches and the thrushes, And all feathered fowls that dwell In that shade majestical. Beyond all clouds and all mistiness I float in the strength of my loveliness; And I move round the sun with a measured motion In the blue expanse of the skyey ocean; And I hear the song of the Angel throng In a river of extasy flow along, Without a pausing, without a hushing, Like an everlasting fountain's gushing That of its own will bubbles up From a white untainted cup. Countless planets float round me Differing all in majesty; Smaller some, and some more great, Amethystine, roseate, Golden, silvery, glowing blue, Hueless, and of every hue. Each and all, both great and small, With a cadence musical, Shoot out rays of glowing praise, Never ending, but always Hymning the Creator's might Who hath filled them full of light. Pealing through eternity, Filling out immensity, Sun and moon and stars together, In heights where is no cloudy weather; Where is nor storm, nor mist, nor rain; Where night goeth not to come again. On, and on, and on for ever, Never ceasing, sinking never, Voiceless adorations rise To the Heaven above the skies. We all chant with a holy harmony, No discord marreth our melody; Here are no strifes nor envyings, But each with love joyously sings, For ever and ever floating free In the azure light of infinity. Summer. Hark to the song of greeting! the tall trees Murmur their welcome in the southern breeze. Amid the thickest foliage many a bird Sits singing, their shrill matins scarcely heard One by one, but all together Welcoming the sunny weather. In every bower hums a bee Fluttering melodiously. Murmurs joy in every brook, Rippling with a pleasant look. What greet they with their guileless bliss? What welcome with a song like this? See in the south a radiant form, Her fair head crowned with roses; From her bright foot-path flies the storm; Upon her breast reposes Many an unconfinèd tress, Golden, glossy, motionless. Face and form are love and light, Soft ineffably, yet bright. All her path is strewn with flowers, Round her float the laughing Hours, Heaven and earth make joyful din, Welcoming sweet Summer in. And now she alights on the Earth To play with her children the flowers; She touches the stems, and the buds have birth, And gently she trains them in bowers. And the bees and the birds are glad, And the wind catches warmth from her breath, And around her is nothing sad, Nor any traces of death. See now she lays her down With roses for her crown, With jessamine and myrtle Forming her fragrant kirtle; Conquered by softest slumbers No more the hours she numbers, The hours that intervene Ere she may wing her flight At length she reached a lonely spot, . . . Why trembled she? why turned she pale? A ruined Cross stood in the midst Of a most quiet vale. A Cross o'ergrown with moss and flowers, A cross fast sinking to decay; The Cross she knew, the Cross she loved In childhood's happy day. And she had journeyed many miles, Morning and eve untiringly, To look again upon that Cross, To look again and die. She knelt within its sacred shade, And hung her garland on the stone; Her azure eyes were bright with tears Of love and joy unknown. And there she knelt, and there she prayed Until her heart was satisfied;— The ancient Cross is standing yet, The youthful wanderer died. Eva. (From Maturin's “Woman.”) Yes, I loved him all too well, And my punishment is just, But its greatness who can tell? Still I have a stedfast trust That the sorrow shall not last, And the trial shall be past, And my faith shall anchor fast. Lord, Thou knowest, I have said, All is good that comes from Thee; Unto Thee I bow my head. I have not repented me. Still, oh! still 'tis bitter ill; Still I have a stubborn will, And my heart is haughty still: Haughty in its humbleness; Proud in its idolatry; Let the loved heel gall and press On my neck: so it should be. 'Twas in madness that I spake it: Let him leave my heart or take it, Let him heal my heart or break it; But it still shall be for him, It shall love him only still.— Nay, it was no passing whim, But a woman's stedfast will. And this word is aye returning: And I cannot quell the yearning That in breast and brain is burning. Tears of mine may quench it never, Bitter tears shed all alone; Dropping, dropping, dropping ever For the thought of him that's gone: Dropping when none see or know. Woe is me! they only flow For the joys of long ago. Foolish one, were it not fitter For thyself to mourn and pray? Tho' thy Father's cup be bitter, Put it not from thee away. It is good and meet and right. Yea, if darksome be the night, The day dawn shall be more bright. Hast thou too much time, in sooth, For the work of penitence, That thou wastest tears and youth Mourning one who is gone hence? For thyself cry out and weep Ere that thou lie down and sleep, And for ever silence keep. Humbly strive to enter in By the strait and narrow gate; Strive the courts of Heaven to win, Where nought maketh desolate; Where are none to come and go; Where no tears may ever flow; Where nor death may be, nor woe. And in prayer think thou of him Who hath left thee sad and lone. Pray that earth's light may grow dim, So to him Heaven's light be shown. Pray that, all thy sins forgiven, Pray that, from his errors shriven, Ye may meet at length in Heaven. Love ephemeral. Love is sweet, and so are flowers Blooming in bright summer bowers; So are waters, clear and pure, In some hidden fountain's store; So is the soft southern breeze Sighing low among the trees; So is the bright queen of heaven, Reigning in the quiet even: Yet the pallid moon may breed Madness in man's feeble seed; And the wind's soft influence Often breathes the pestilence; And the waves may sullied be As they hurry to the sea; Flowers soon must fade away— Love endures but for a day. Burial Anthem. Flesh of our flesh—bone of our bone— (For thou and we in Christ are one) Thy soul unto its rest hath flown, And thou has left us all alone Our weary race to run In doubt, and want, and sin, and pain, Whilst thou wilt never sin again. For us remaineth heaviness; Thou never more shalt feel distress, For thou hast found repose Beside the bright eternal river That clear and pure flows on for ever, And sings as on it flows. And it is better far for thee To reach at once thy rest, Than share with us earth's misery, Or tainted joy at best; Brother, we will not mourn for thee, Although our hearts be weary Of struggling with our enemy, When all around is dreary. But we will pray that still we may Press onward in the narrow way With a calm thankful resignation, And joy in this our desolation. And we will hope at length to be With our Great Head, and, friend! with thee Beside that river blest. Sappho. I sigh at day-dawn, and I sigh When the dull day is passing by. I sigh at evening, and again I sigh when night brings sleep to men. Oh! it were better far to die Than thus for ever mourn and sigh, And in death's dreamless sleep to be Unconscious that none weep for me; Eased from my weight of heaviness, Forgetful of forgetfulness, Resting from pain and care and sorrow Thro' the long night that knows no morrow; Living unloved, to die unknown, Unwept, untended and alone. Tasso and Leonora. A glorious vision hovers o'er his soul, Gilding the prison and the weary bed Though hard the pillow placed beneath his head; Though brackish be the water in the bowl Beside him; he can see the planets roll In glowing adoration, without dread; Knowing how, by unerring wisdom led, They struggle not against the strong control. When suddenly a star shoots from the skies, Than all the other stars more purely bright, Replete with heavenly loves and harmonies; He starts:—what meets his full awakening sight? Lo! Leonora with large humid eyes, Gazing upon him in the misty light. ON THE DEATH OF A CAT, A Friend of Mine, Aged Ten Years and a Half. Who shall tell the lady's grief When her Cat was past relief? Who shall number the hot tears Shed o'er her, beloved for years? Who shall say the dark dismay Which her dying caused that day? Come, ye Muses, one and all, Come obedient to my call. Come and mourn, with tuneful breath, Each one for a separate death; And while you in numbers sigh, I will sing her elegy. Of a noble race she came, And Grimalkin was her name. Young and old full many a mouse Felt the prowess of her house: Weak and strong full many a rat Cowered beneath her crushing pat: And the birds around the place Shrank from her too close embrace. But one night, reft of her strength, She laid down and died at length: Lay a kitten by her side, In whose life the mother died. Spare her line and lineage, Guard her kitten's tender age, And that kitten's name as wide Shall be known as her's that died. And whoever passes by The poor grave where Puss doth lie, Softly, softly let him tread, Nor disturb her narrow bed. Mother and Child. “What art thou thinking of,” said the Mother, “What art thou thinking of my child?” “I was thinking of Heaven,” he answered her, And looked up in her face and smiled. “And what didst thou think of Heaven?” she said; “Tell me, my little one!” “Oh . . , I thought that there the flowers never fade, That there never sets the sun.” “And wouldst thou love to go thither, my child? Thither wouldst thou love to go? And leave the pretty flowers that wither, And the sun that sets below?” “Oh, I would be glad to go there, mother, To go and live there now; And I would pray for thy coming, mother, My mother, wouldst not thou?” FAIR MARGARET. “Fair Margaret sat in her bower window, Combing her yellow hair; There she spied sweet William and his bride As they were a riding near.” —Old Ballad. The faith of years is broken, The fate of years is spoken, Years past, and years to come; I pity and I scorn thee, I would not now adorn me For thy false bridal home. Yet thou, perfidious wooer, Thou yet mayst be the ruer, For thou mayst meet with one Who will not love thee really, But cast kind glances merely That thou mayst be undone. Soft eyes, and dark, and flashing, Thy hopes may yet be dashing, Thou yet mayst be deceived; And then think on her sadly, Whom once thou grievedst gladly, Ere thou thyself wast grieved. And if despair should seize thee, And urge thee to release thee From weariness and life, Oh! think on her who'll languish, Bearing the bitter anguish Of a heart's bitter strife. For, though I may not love thee, Though calm as heaven above me, My thoughts of thee must be, I cannot break so lightly The chain that bound me tightly, Once bound my soul to thee. Earth and Heaven. Water calmly flowing, Sun-light deeply glowing, Swans some river riding, That is gently gliding By the fresh green rushes; The sweet rose that blushes, Hyacinths whose dow'r Is both scent and flow'r, Skylark's soaring motion, Sun-rise from the ocean, Jewels that lie sparkling 'Neath the waters darkling, Sea-weed, coral, amber, Flow'rs that climb and clamber, Or more lowly flourish Where the earth may nourish; All these are beautiful, Of beauty Earth is full:— Say, to our promised Heaven Can greater charms be given? Yes; for aye in Heav'n doth dwell Glowing, indestructible, What here below finds tainted birth In the corrupted sons of Earth; For, filling there and satisfying Man's soul unchanging and undying, Earth's fleeting joys and beauties far above, In Heaven is Love. Love attacked. Love is more sweet than flowers, But sooner dying; Warmer than sunny hours, But faster flying; Softer than music's whispers Springing with day To murmur till the vespers, Then die away; More kind than friendship's greeting, But as untrue, Brighter than hope, but fleeting More swiftly too; Like breath of summer breezes Gently it sighs, But soon, alas! one ceases, The other dies; And like an inundation It leaves behind An utter desolation Of heart and mind. Who then would court Love's presence, If here below It can but be the essence Of restless woe? Returned or unrequited 'Tis still the same; The flame was never lighted, Or sinks the flame. Yet all, both fools and sages, Have felt its power, In distant lands and ages, Here, at this hour. Then what from fear and weeping Shall give me rest? Oh tell me, ye who sleeping At length are blest! In answer to my crying Sounds like incense Rose from the earth, replying, Indifference. Love defended. Who extols a wilderness? Who hath praised indifference? Foolish one, thy words are sweet, But devoid of sense. As the man who ne'er hath seen, Or as he who cannot hear, Is the heart that hath no part In Love's hope and fear. True, the blind do not perceive The unsightly things around; True, the deaf man trembleth not At an awful sound. But the face of Heaven and Earth, And the murmur of the main, Surely are a recompense For a little pain. So, tho' Love may not be free Always from a taint of grief, If its sting is very sharp, Great is its relief. Divine and Human Pleading. “I would the saints could hear our prayers! If such a thing might be, O blessed Mary Magdalene, I would appeal to thee! “For once in lowly penitence Thy head was bowed with shame; But now thou hast a glorious place, And hast an unknown name.” So mused a trembling contrite man, So mused he wearily; By angels borne his thoughts appeared Before the Throne on high. The calm, still night was at its noon, And all men were at rest, When came before the sleeper's eyes A vision of the blest. A woman stood beside his bed, Her breath was fragrance all; Round her the light was very bright, The air was musical. Her footsteps shone upon the stars, Her robe was spotless white; Her breast was radiant with the Cross, Her head with living light. Her eyes beamed with a sacred fire; And on her shoulders fair, From underneath her golden crown Clustered her golden hair. Yet on her bosom her white hands Were folded quietly; Yet was her glorious head bowed low In deep humility. Long time she looked upon the ground; Then raising her bright eyes Her voice came forth as sweet and soft As music when it dies. “O thou who in thy secret hour Hast dared to think that aught Is faulty in God's perfect plan, And perfect in thy thought! “Thou who the pleadings would'st prefer Of one sin-stained like me To His Who is the Lord of Life, To His Who died for thee! “In mercy I am sent from Heaven: Be timely wise, and learn To seek His love Who waits for thee, Inviting thy return. “Well know I His long-suffering And intercession's worth; My guilt was as a heavy chain That bound me to the earth. “It was a clog upon my feet, To keep me from Life's path; It was a stain upon my hands, A curse upon my hearth. “But there is mighty Power and Grace Can loose the heavy chain, Can free the feet, can cleanse the hands, Can purge the hearth again. “Weeping I sought the Lord of Life, Bowed with my shame and sin; And then unto my wondering heart Love's searching fire came in. “It was with deep repentance, I knelt down at His Feet Who can change the sorrow into joy, The bitter into sweet. “I had cast away my jewels And my rich attire; And my breast was filled with a holy flame, And my heart with a holy fire. “My tears were more precious Than my precious pearls;— My tears that fell upon His Feet As I wiped Them with my curls. “My youth and my beauty Were budding to their prime; But I wept for the great transgression, The sin of other time. “Trembling betwixt hope and fear, I sought the King of Heaven; Forsook the evil of my ways, Loved much, and was forgiven. “In hope and fear I went to Him, He broke and healed my heart; No man was there to intercede; As I was, so thou art.” TO MY FRIEND ELIZABETH. with some Postage Stamps towards a collection. Sweetest Elizabeth, accept I pray These lowly stamps I send in homage true; One hundred humble servants in their way Are not to be despised, though poor to view. Their livery of red and black, nor gay, Nor sober all, is typical of you, In whom are gravity and gladness mixed. Thought here, smiles there; perfection lies betwixt. Love and Hope. Love for ever dwells in Heaven, Hope entereth not there. To despairing man Love's given, Hope dwells not with despair. Love reigneth high, and reigneth low, and reigneth everywhere. In the inmost heart Love dwelleth, It may not quenchèd be; E'en when the life-blood welleth Its fond effects we see. In the name that leaves the lips the last, fades last from memory. And when we shall awaken Ascending to the sky, Tho' Hope shall have forsaken, Sweet Love shall never die. For perfect Love, and perfect bliss, shall be our lot on high. Serenade. Come, wander forth with me! the orange flowers Breathe faintest perfume from the summer bowers. Come, wander forth with me! the moon on high Shines proudly in a flood of brilliancy. Around her car each burning star Gleams like a beacon from afar; The night-wind scarce disturbs the sea As it sighs forth so languidly, Laden with sweetness like a bee; And all is still, below, above, Save murmurs of the turtle dove, That murmurs ever of its love: For now 'tis the hour, the balmy hour When the strains of love have chiefly power; When the maid looks forth from her latticed bower, With a gentle yielding smile, Donning her mantle all the while. Now the moon beams down on high From her halo brilliantly; By the dark clouds unencumbered That once o'er her pale face slumbered. Far from her mild rays flutters Folly, For on them floats calm Melancholy. A passionless sadness without dread, Like the thought of those we loved long dead, Full of hope and chastened joy, Heavenly without earth's alloy. Listen, dearest! all is quiet, Slumb'ring the world's toil and riot, And all is fair in earth and sky and sea, Come, wander forth with me! The Rose. Gentle, gentle river Hurrying along With a sparkle ever, And a murmured song, Pause in thine onward motion, Fast flowing toward the ocean, And give this rose from me To haughty Coralie. Tell her that love's symbol, The deep blushing rose, Doth in all resemble That it would disclose. Untended, shortly thriving There'll soon be no reviving; But nursed with kindliness 'T will cheer life's wilderness. Present and Future. What is life that we should love it, Cherishing it evermore, Never prizing aught above it, Ever loath to give it o'er? Is it goodness? Is it gladness? Nay, 'tis more of sin and sadness, Nay, of weariness 'tis more. Earthly joys are very fleeting— Earthly sorrows very long;— Parting ever follows meeting, Night succeeds to even-song. Storms may darken in the morning, And eclipse the sun's bright dawning, And the chilly gloom prolong. But though clouds may screen and hide it The sun shines for evermore; Then bear grief in hope: abide it, Knowing that it must give o'er: And the darkness shall flee from us, And the sun beam down upon us Ever glowing more and more. WILL THESE HANDS NE'ER BE CLEAN? And who is this lies prostrate at thy feet? And is he dead, thou man of wrath and pride? Yes, now thy vengeance is complete, Thy hate is satisfied. What had he done to merit this of thee? Who gave thee power to take away his life? Oh deeply-rooted direful enmity That ended in long strife! See where he grasped thy mantle as he fell, Staining it with his blood; how terrible Must be the payment due for this in hell! And dost thou think to go and see no more Thy bleeding victim, now the struggle's o'er? To find out peace in other lands, And wash the red mark from thy hands? It shall not be; for everywhere He shall be with thee; and the air Shall smell of blood, and on the wind His groans pursue thee close behind. When waking he shall stand before thee; And when at length sleep shall come o'er thee, Powerless to move, alive to dream, So dreadful shall thy visions seem That thou shalt own them even to be More hateful than reality What time thou stoopest down to drink Of limpid waters, thou shalt think It is thy foe's blood bubbles up From the polluted fountain's cup, That stains thy lip, that cries to Heaven For vengeance—and it shall be given. And when thy friends shall question thee, “Why art thou changed so heavily?” Trembling and fearful thou shalt say “I am not changed,” and turn away; For such an outcast shalt thou be Thou wilt not dare ask sympathy. And so thy life will pass, and day by day The current of existence flow away; And though to thee earth shall be hell, and breath Vengeance, yet thou shalt tremble more at death. And one by one thy friends will learn to fear thee, And thou shalt live without a hope to cheer thee; Lonely amid a thousand, chained though free, The curse of memory shall cling to thee: Ages may pass away, worlds rise and set— But thou shalt not forget. SIR EUSTACE GREY. See Crabbe. When I die, oh lay me low Where the greenest grasses grow; Where the happy stream meanders; Where the deer securely wanders; Where the sweet birds sit and sing In the branches quivering; Where the violets spring to die, And the breezes passing by, Laden with their fragrant breath, Scarcely seem to tell of death; Where the sun can dart no ray In the noon-tide of his day; Where upon the fertile ground Broods an everlasting shade, And a strange, mysterious sound By the rustling boughs is made, And all's quiet, meet for one Whose long, toilsome race is run. O'er my grave the turf extend, But beside me lay no friend, And above me place no stone; I would lie there all alone, Unremembered or unknown. Soon forgotten, none will taunt me; Soon forgetting, none will haunt me Of the ghosts of former pleasures Meted out with scanty measures. Resting from all human passion, From earth's hate and its compassion, From its hope and fear, from love Stedfast as the stars above, That shine clearly down for ever On some cold, unglowing river; By my faith and hope sure lighted Through the darkness of the tomb; And by Heavenly Love requited For whatever love was slighted, And whatever joy was blighted By earth's coldness and its gloom, In the grave I'll rest secure Till the appointed time is o'er, And the work of love is done, And the great sin; and the sun Sets in night to rise no more. What is life but toil and riot? What is death but rest and quiet? Life is but a dream of trouble, Death calm sleep from visions free; Life is but a bursting bubble, Death is immortality. THE TIME OF WAITING. Life is fleeting, joy is fleeting, Coldness follows love and greeting, Parting still succeeds to meeting. If I say, “Rejoice today,” Sorrow meets me in the way, I cannot my will obey. If I say, “My grief shall cease; Now then I will live in peace:” My cares instantly increase. When I look up to the sky, Thinking to see light on high, Clouds my searching glance defy. When I look upon the earth For the flowers that should have birth, I find dreariness and dearth. And the wind sighs on for ever, Murmurs still the flowing river, On the graves the sun-beams quiver. And destruction waxes bold, And the earth is growing old, And I tremble in the cold. And my weariness increases To an ache that never ceases, And a pain that ne'er decreases. And the times are turbulent, And the Holy Church is rent, And who tremble or repent? And loud cries do ever rise To the portals of the skies From our earthly miseries; From love slighted, not requited; From high hope that should have lighted All our path up, now benighted; From the woes of human kind; From the darkness of the mind; From all anguish undefined; From the heart that's crushed and sinking; From the brain grown blank with thinking; From the spirit sorrow drinking. All cry out with pleading strong: “Vengeance, Lord; how long, how long Shall we suffer this great wrong?” And the pleading and the cry Of earth's sons are heard on high, And are noted verily. When this world shall be no more, The Oppressors shall endure The great Vengeance, which is sure. And the sinful shall remain To an endless death and pain; But the good shall live again, Never more to be oppressed; Balm shall heal the bleeding breast, And the weary be at rest. All shall vanish of dejection, Grief, and fear, and imperfection, In that glorious Resurrection. Heed not then a night of sorrow, If the dawning of the morrow From past grief fresh beams shall borrow. Thankful for whate'er is given, Strive we, as we ne'er have striven, For love's sake to be forgiven. Then, the dark clouds opening, Ev'n to us the sun shall bring Gladness; and sweet flowers shall spring. For Christ's guiding Love alway, For the everlasting Day, For meek patience, let us pray. Charity. I praised the myrtle and the rose, At sunrise in their beauty vying; I passed them at the short day's close, And both were dying. The summer sun his rays was throwing Brightly; yet ere I sought my rest, His last cold ray, more deeply glowing, Died in the west. After this bleak world's stormy weather, All, all, save Love alone, shall die; For Faith and Hope shall merge together In Charity. The Dead Bride. There she lay so still and pale, With her bridal robes around her: Joy is fleeting—life is frail— Death had found her. Gone for ever: gone away From the love and light of earth; Gone for ever: who shall say Where her second birth? Had her life been good and kind? Had her heart been meek and pure? Was she of a lowly mind, Ready to endure? Did she still console the sad, Soothe the widow's anguish wild, Make the poor and needy glad, Tend the orphan child? Who shall say what hope and fear Crowded in her short life's span? If the love of God was dear, Or the love of man? Happy bride if single-hearted Her first love to God was given; If from this world she departed But to dwell in Heaven; If her faith on Heaven was fixed, And her hope; if love's pure worth Made her rich indeed, unmixed With the dross of earth. But alas! if tainted pleasure Won her heart and held it here, Where is now her failing treasure, All her gladness where? . . . . . Hush, too curious questioner; Hush and think thine own sins o'er: Little canst thou learn from her; For we know no more Than that there she lies all pale With her bridal robes around her: Joy is fleeting—life is frail— Death hath found her. LIFE OUT OF DEATH. “Now I've said all I would, mother; My head is on thy breast, And I feel I can die without a sigh, And sink into my rest. “And if ever you weep o'er my grave, mother, Weep not for doubt or sadness; I shall fall asleep in pain and in grief, But wake to perfect gladness.” Mourn not, thou mother of the dead, That in her youth she died; for He was with her then Who said: “Ye that in me abide, Ask what ye will, it shall be given; Faith, hope, and love on earth, and Love and Joy in Heaven.” The solitary Rose. O happy Rose, red Rose, that bloomest lonely Where there are none to gather while they love thee; That art perfumed by thine own fragrance only, Resting like incense round thee and above thee;— Thou hearest nought save some pure stream that flows, O happy Rose. What tho' for thee no nightingales are singing? They chant one eve, but hush them in the morning. Near thee no little moths and bees are winging To steal thy honey when the day is dawning;— Thou keep'st thy sweetness till the twilight's close, O happy Rose. Then rest in peace, thou lone and lovely flower; Yea be thou glad, knowing that none are near thee To mar thy beauty in a wanton hour, And scatter all thy leaves, nor deign to wear thee. Securely in thy solitude repose, O happy Rose. Lady Isabella. Lady Isabella, Thou art gone away, Leaving earth's darksome trouble, To rest until the Day. From thy youth and beauty, From each loving friend, Thou art gone to the land of sure repose, Where fears and sorrows end. Thou wert pure whilst with us; Now, we trust, in Heaven, All thy tears are wiped away, All thy sins forgiven. Who would wish thee back again But to share our sorrow? Who would grudge thine hour of rest, Ere the coming morrow? Let us rejoice the rather That thou hast reached that shore, Whilst yet thy soul was spotless, And thy young spirit pure. And if thy crown be brighter By but one little ray, Why wish to dim its lustre? . . Oh! rather let us pray That when we are most fitted We too may pass away. THE DREAM. Rest, rest; the troubled breast Panteth evermore for rest:— Be it sleep, or be it death, Rest is all it coveteth. Tell me, dost thou remember the old time We sat together by that sunny stream, And dreamed our happiness was too sublime Only to be a dream? Gazing, till steadfast gazing made us blind, We watched the fishes leaping at their play; Thinking our love too tender and too kind Ever to pass away. And some of all our thoughts were true at least What time we thought together by that stream; THY happiness has evermore increased,— MY love was not a dream. And now that thou art gone, I often sit On its green margin, for thou once wert there; And see the clouds that, floating over it, Darken the quiet air. Yes, oftentimes I sit beside it now, Harkning the wavelets ripple o'er the sands; Until again I hear thy whispered vow And feel thy pressing hands. Then the bright sun seems to stand still in heaven, The stream sings gladly as it onward flows, The rushes grow more green, the grass more even, Blossoms the budding rose. I say: “It is a joy-dream; I will take it; He is not gone; he will return to me.” What found'st thou in my heart that thou should'st break it?— How have I injured thee? Oh! I am weary of life's passing show,— Its pageant and its pain. I would I could lie down lone in my woe, Ne'er to rise up again; I would I could lie down where none might know; For truly love is vain. Truly love's vain; but oh! how vainer still Is that which is not love, but seems; Concealed indifference, a covered ill, A very dream of dreams. The Dying Man to his Betrothed. One word—'tis all I ask of thee; One word—and that is little now That I have learned thy wrong of me; And thou too art unfaithful—thou!— O thou sweet poison, sweetest death, O honey between serpent's teeth, Breathe on me with thy scorching breath! The last poor hope is fleeting now, And with it life is ebbing fast; I gaze upon thy cold white brow, And loathe and love thee to the last. And still thou keepest silence—still Thou look'st on me—for good or ill Speak out, that I may know thy will. Thou weepest, woman, and art pale! Weep not, for thou shalt soon be free; My life is ending like a tale That was—but never more shall be. O blessed moments, ye fleet fast, And soon the latest shall be past, And she will be content at last. Nay, tremble not—I have not cursed Thy house or mine, or thee or me; The moment that I saw thee first, The moment that I first loved thee, Curse them! alas!—I can but bless, In this mine hour of heaviness;— Nay, sob not so in thy distress! I have been harsh, thou sayst of me;— God knows my heart was never so; It never could be so to thee— And now it is too late—I know Thy grief—forgive me, love! 'tis o'er, For I shall never trouble more Thy life that was so calm before. I pardon thee—mayst thou be blest! Say, wilt thou sometimes think of me? Oh may I, from my happy rest, Still look with love on thine and thee, And may I pray for thee alway, And for thy Love still may I pray, Waiting the everlasting Day. Stoop over me—ah! this is death! I scarce can see thee at my side; Stoop lower—let me feel thy breath, O thou, mine own, my promised bride! Pardon me, love—I pardon thee, And may our pardon sealèd be Throughout the long eternity. The pains of death my senses cover:— Oh! for His Sake Who died for men, Be thou more true to this thy lover Than thou hast been to me—Amen! And if he chide thee wrongfully, One little moment think on me, And thou wilt bear it patiently. And now, O God, I turn to Thee: Thou Only, Father, canst not fail; Lord, Thou hast tried and broken me, And yet Thy Mercy shall prevail. Saviour, through Thee I am forgiven— Do Thou receive my soul, blood-shriven, O Christ, Who art the Gate of Heaven! The Martyr. See, the sun hath risen! Lead her from the prison; She is young and tender, lead her tenderly: May no fear subdue her, Lest the Saints be fewer, Lest her place in Heaven be lost eternally. Forth she came, not trembling, No, nor yet dissembling An o'erwhelming terror weighing her down—down; Little, little heeding Earth, but inly pleading For the strength to triumph and to win a crown. All her might was rallied To her heart; not pallid Was her cheek, but glowing with a glorious red, Glorious red and saintly, Never paling faintly, But still flushing, kindling still, without thought of dread. On she went, on faster, Trusting in her Master, Feeling that His Eye watched o'er her lovingly; He would prove and try her, But would not deny her, When her soul had pass'd, for His sake, patiently. “Christ,” she said, “receive me, Let no terrors grieve me, Take my soul and guard it with Thy heavenly cares: Take my soul and guard it, Take it and reward it With the Love Thou bearest for the love it bears.” Quickened with a fire Of sublime desire, She looked up to Heaven, and she cried aloud, “Death, I do entreat thee, Come! I go to meet thee; Wrap me in the whiteness of a virgin shroud.” On she went, hope-laden; Happy, happy maiden! Never more to tremble, and to weep no more: All her sins forgiven, Straight the path to Heaven Through the glowing fire lay her feet before. On she went, on quickly, And her breath came thickly, With the longing to see God coming pantingly: Now the fire is kindled, And her flesh has dwindled Unto dust;—her soul is mounting up on high: Higher, higher mounting, The swift moments counting, Fear is left beneath her, and the chastening rod: Tears no more shall blind her, Trouble lies behind her, Satisfied with hopeful rest, and replete with God. The End of Time. Thou who art dreary With a cureless woe, Thou who art weary Of all things below, Thou who art weeping By the loved sick-bed, Thou who art keeping Watches o'er the dead, Hope, hope! old Time flies fast upon his way, And soon will cease the night, and soon will dawn the day. The rose blooms brightly, But it fades ere night; And youth flies lightly, Yet how sure its flight! And still the river Merges in the sea, And death reigns ever Whilst old Time shall be; Yet hope! old Time flies fast upon his way, And soon will cease the night, and soon will dawn the day. All we most cherish In this world below, What tho' it perish? It has aye been so. So thro' all ages It has ever been To fools and sages, Noble men and mean: Yet hope, still hope! for Time flies on his way, And soon will end the night, and soon will dawn the day. All of each nation Shall that morning see With exultation Or with misery: From watery slumbers, From the opening sod, Shall rise up numbers To be judged by God. Then hope and fear, for Time speeds on his way, And soon must end the night, and soon must dawn the day. Resurrection Eve. He resteth: weep not! The living sleep not With so much calm: He hears no chiding And no deriding, Hath joy for sorrow, For night hath morrow, For wounds hath balm, For life's strange riot Hath death and quiet. Who would recall him Of those that love him? No fears appal him, No ills befal him; There's nought above him Save turf and flowers And pleasant grass. Pass the swift hours, How swiftly pass! The hours of slumber He doth not number; Grey hours of morning Ere the day's dawning: Brightened by gleams Of the sun-beams, By the foreseeing Of Resurrection, Of glorious being, Of full perfection, Of sins forgiven Before the face Of men and spirits; Of God in Heaven, The Resting Place That he inherits. ZARA. See Maturin's “Women.” Now the pain beginneth and the word is spoken;— Hark unto the tolling of the churchyard chime!— Once my heart was gladsome, now my heart is broken,— Once my love was noble, now it is a crime. But the fear is over; yea, what now shall pain me? Arm thee in thy sorrow, O most Desolate! Weariness and weakness, these shall now sustain me,— Pride and bitter grieving, burning love and hate. Yea, the fear is over, the strong fear and trembling; I can doubt no longer, he is gone indeed. Rend thy hair, lost woman, weep without dissembling; The heart torn forth from it, shall the breast not bleed? Happy she who looketh on his beauty's glory! Happy she who listeneth to his gentle word! Yet, O happy maiden, sorrow lies before thee; Greeting hath been given, parting must be heard. He shall leave thee also, he who now hath left me, With a weary spirit and an aching heart; Thou shalt be bereaved by him who hath bereft me; Thou hast sucked the honey,—feel the stinging's smart. Let the cold gaze on him, let the heartless hear him, For he shall not hurt them, they are safe in sooth: But let loving women shun that man and fear him, Full of cruel kindness and devoid of ruth. When ye call upon him, hope for no replying; When ye gaze upon him, think not he will look; Hope not for his pity when your heart is sighing; Such another, waiting, weeping, he forsook. Hath the Heaven no thunder wherewith to denounce him? Hath the Heaven no lightning wherewith to chastise? O my heart and spirit, O my soul, renounce him Who hath called for vengeance from the distant skies. Vengeance which pursues thee, vengeance which shall find thee, Crushing thy false spirit, scathing thy fair limb:— O ye thunders deafen, O ye lightnings blind me, Winds and storms from heaven, strike me but spare him. I forgive thee, dearest, cruel, I forgive thee;— May thy cup of sorrow be poured out for me; Though the dregs be bitter yet they shall not grieve me, Knowing that I drink them, O my love, for thee. [Soul rudderless, unbraced] Soul rudderless, unbraced, The Body's friend and guest, Whither away today? Unsuppled, pale, discased, Dumb to thy wonted jest. III Unpublished Poems Heaven. 1 What is heaven? 'tis a country Far away from mortal ken; 'Tis a land, where, by God's bounty, After death live righteous men. 2 That that blest land I may enter, Is my humble, earnest cry; Lord! admit me to Thy presence, Lord! admit me, or I die. Hymn. To the God Who reigns on high, To th'Eternal Majesty, To the Blessed Trinity Glory on earth be giv'n; In the sea, and in the sky, And in the highest heav'n. Corydon's Lament and Resolution. 1 I have wept and I have sighed; Chloe will not be my bride. I have sighed and I have wept, She hath not her promise kept. 2 I have grieved and I have mourned; She hath not my love returned. I have mourned and I have grieved; She hath not my pains relieved. 3 But her pride I'll mortify, For her love I will not die. Amaryllis fair I'll wed, Nor one tear for Chloe shed. Rosalind. She sat upon a mountain, And gazed upon the sea; Beside her crouched a stag-hound, A boy stood at her knee. She fixed upon the ocean An agonizèd stare— The ship is fast receding— Her husband off they bear. “Oh, robbers! take some pity Upon my helpless state: Restore him to my fond arms! Leave me not desolate!” They heed not her entreaties, They list not to her prayer; The ship is fast receding— Her husband off they bear. “Oh Captain! take these jewels That grace my hair of jet; And ne'er in my devotion To bless thee I'll forget.” Then sudden cried the pirate, “Lady, your prayers are vain; When as my bride I sought you, You heeded not my pain. “Now for the grief I suffered I'll compensated be”— He said; and hurled her husband Into the raging sea. Upon her snow-white bosom Sank down that Lady's head;— “I join thee, dearest Arthur”— Fair Rosalind is dead. The Faithless Shepherdess. 1 There once was a time when I loved, 'Tis gone to return never more; My shepherdess faithless has proved, The maiden I once did adore. 2 And now we are parted for ever, And gone are my hopes and my fears, To forget Phillis false I'll endeavour, And arrest all these fast-flowing tears. 3 Yet wherever I turn I must think Of her who is faithless to me; I stand by the rivulet's brink, And the play of its waters I see. 4 'Twas there I first told her my love, And she blushingly bade me hope still, And the moon looking down from above Seemed to smile on the murmuring rill; 5 On the rill that was murm'ring of love To its beautiful mistress in heaven, The moon seeming to speak far above Of the rays that in token she'd given; 6 In token of love never-ending, And pure as when first 'twas avowed, As long as that stream should be sending Soft sighs to its Queen in the cloud. 7 And false Phillis swore that she'd ever Keep faithful her pure heart to me, That she'd think of another love never, So long as the rill true should be. 8 The rill to its love true remains, The moon still smiles on it from heaven, But from you I've experienced sharp pains, That the rill to the moon ne'er has given. 9 And now we are parted for ever, And gone are my hopes and my fears; To forget Phillis false I'll endeavour, And arrest all these fast-flowing tears. Ariadne to Theseus. 1 Sunlight to the river, Moonlight to the sea, As false and as fleeting Thou hast been to me. 2 And I've been like the lily That to the summer clings, Or like the nightingale That to the sweet rose sings: 3 That wooing never ceases For her indifference, And never his beloved flower Reproaching will incense. 4 But thou more cruel than the rose Hast left me faithlessly, To mourn for ever and alone Over thy perfidy. 5 Soft breezes! waft him not Across the wide wide sea; Ingulph, just waves of Ocean! The wretch who flies from me. 6 Ah no! 'tis vain! Affection For my false love still remains: Blow, breezes! Peace, ye waters! Revenge not ye my pains! 7 May happiness attend thee, Who hast ta'en from me all joy! Be thine unmixèd pleasure; Be mine the sad alloy! On Albina. The roses lingered in her cheeks, When fair Albina fainted; Oh! gentle Reader, could it be That fair Albina painted? A Hymn for Christmas Day. The Shepherds watch their flocks by night, Beneath the moon's unclouded light, All around is calm and still, Save the murm'ring of the rill: When lo! a form of light appears, And on the awe-struck Shepherds' ears Are words, of peace and comfort flowing From lips with love celestial glowing. Spiritual forms are breaking Through the gloom, their voices taking Part in the adoring song Of the bright angelic throng. Wondering the Shepherds bend Their steps to Bethlehem, and wend To a poor and crowded inn:— Tremblingly their way they win To the stable, where they find The Redeemer of mankind, Just born into this world of danger, Lying in an humble manger. And they spread abroad each word Which that joyful night they'd heard, And they glorified the name Of their gracious God, Who came Himself to save from endless woe The offspring of this world below. Love and Death. “Our bark's on the water; come down, come down, I'll weave for thy fair head a leafy crown, And in it I'll blend the roses bright, With asphodel woven of faint sunlight. But more precious than these I'll twine the pearls In the flowing locks of thy chestnut curls; And the gem and the flow'r from wave and from tree Shall form a bright diadem, Bianca, for thee. The sea is calm, and I will guard thee; Oh what, sweet love, should thus retard thee? Descend, fairest maiden, descend to the sea, And sail o'er the motionless waters with me.” The sound of his last words was scarcely o'er, When beside him she stood on the ocean shore. Lightly she entered the gondola, And gaily her lover followed her— But for them it had been happier Had they quietly lain in their beds all night, Nor sailed forth 'neath the moonbeam's deceitful light. Smoothly, swiftly the gondolier rowed along, The splash of his oars keeping time to his song; 'Twas an old tale of hope and of fear and of danger, Of the loves of a noble princess and a stranger; How they fled, and were married one fine summer night, And their days glided on in one stream of delight. But oh! wherefore trembles that lady fair? The lightning gleams forth through the heavy air; The thunder peals loudly, the low wind is wailing, And the heart of the lady for terror is failing. But Gonsalvo around her his left arm clasped tightly, And he fought with the sea that was foaming so whitely; All vain are his struggles—the billows rise higher, The thunder is pealing, the sky seems on fire, The wild wind is howling, the lightning ne'er ceases— He still clasps his love, but his strength fast decreases— Fair Bianca has fainted; she hears not the wind, Nor the splash of the rain; to the lightning she's blind— She knows not that down to the depths of the sea She's dragging her love irresistibly: Gonsalvo's efforts have fainter grown, And she hangs on his arm like a heavy stone;— And now o'er them rolls each mighty wave— In the sea they have found a common grave. Despair. 1 Up rose the moon in glory, And glittered on the sea; Up rose the stars around her, Making the darkness flee. 2 The nightingale's wild warbling Rang in the far-off wood; When in his Father's castle A mournful figure stood. 3 His heart was almost bursting, He madly beat his breast; As, in low plaintive accents, His grief he thus exprest. 4 “Stars, shroud yourselves in darkness! Pale moon, withdraw thy light! Let darkness hide the ocean For ever from my sight; 5 “Hide cottage, town and city;— Appear no more, thou Sun! But let in foreign countries Thy cheering race be run. 6 “For I have lost my loved one! Low lies she in her grave! Speak not to me of pleasure, For her I could not save. 7 “Hark to the distant murmur As waves break on the shore”— When lo! a light came flashing Along the corridor. 8 The mystic form that bore it He scarcely could discern; Its flowing robe was blackness— Higher the flame doth burn— 9 He cried, “What art thou, Spirit So luminous and bright?” A voice said, “I'm the maid, Sir, A bringing in the light.” Forget Me Not. 1 “Forget me not! Forget me not!” The maiden once did say, When to some far-off battle-field Her lover sped away. 2 “Forget me not! Forget me not!” Says now the chamber-maid When the traveller on his journey No more will be delayed. Easter Morning. 1 The sun arises from the sea, And all around his rays is flinging, The flowers are opening on the lea, The merry birds are singing. 2 The summer breeze is rustling past, Sweet scents are gathering around it, The rivulet is flowing fast, Beside the banks that bound it. 3 All nature seemeth to rejoice, In the returning summer weather; Let us with nature raise our voice, And harmonise together. 4 But not alone for summer skies Shall praise unto our God be given: This day our Saviour did arise, And oped the gate of heaven. 5 To sinful man, if only he His errings will confess with sorrow, Then, after earth's night-misery, Shall dawn a glorious morrow: 6 A blissful bright eternity Bought by the rising of the Giver, To Whom all praise, all honour be, For ever and for ever. The Last Words of St. Telemachus. There is a sound of weeping; wherefore weep That I should sleep? Oh! wherefore mourn that I at last should be At liberty? One only grief yet lingers at my heart— That we must part: Part—! and perchance we never more may meet In converse sweet! The memory of all thy gentle ways, Kind without praise— And of thy loving acts, scarce seen before, Now numbered o'er, Weigh me to earth clinging about my heart— And must we part? Yet still my trust in God shall stedfast be— By faith I see Through the long vista of eternal years, Free from all fears, Thee by my side in calm unchanging rest, For ever blest! Lord Thomas and fair Margaret. 1 Fair Marg'ret sat in her bower, Unbraiding of her hair, When entered in Lord Thomas' ghost, And gave her greeting fair. 2 “Oh how pale thou art, my love,” she said, “Oh how pale thou art to see! Once thine eye was bright, and thy cheek was red; Why comest thou so to me?” 3 “Oh fair Marg'ret, oh sweet Marg'ret, I murderèd have been— They have ta'en my body for love of thee, And cast it in a stream. 4 “Oh fair Marg'ret, oh sweet Marg'ret, We aye maun parted be, If thou wilt not bind up thy yellow hair, And quickly follow me.” 5 Up and ris fair Marg'ret, And quickly followed him; As the moon was the colour of his face, And the colour of his limb. 6 The ghost he fled, the ghost he sped, The ghost he ran and glided, And still fair Margaret pursued, Though never to be brided. 7 The ghost he sped, the ghost he fled, Ploughed land and hillocks over, And still fair Margaret pursued. After her flying lover. 8 Away, away “without stop or stay,” Till they came to waters running, “I canna stay, I maun away, For fast the day is coming. 9 “Oh fair Marg'ret, oh sweet Marg'ret, We now maun parted be, If in the last trail thou shalt go through Thy heart should fail in thee.” 10 On glided the ghost, while the starry host Glittered down on the sleeping stream; O'er the waves glided he impalpably, Then vanished like a dream. 11 Fair Margaret still followed him, Till she sank amid the wave; Thus died for each other these lovers true, And were joinèd in the grave. Lines to my Grandfather. Dear Grandpapa, To be obedient, I'll try and write a letter; Which (as I hope you'll deem expedient) Must serve for lack of better. My muse of late was not prolific, And sometimes I must feel To make a verse a task terrific Rather of woe than weal. As I have met with no adventure Of wonder and refulgence, I must write plain things at a venture And trust to your indulgence. The apple-tree is showing Its blossom of bright red With a soft colour glowing Upon its leafy bed. The pear-tree's pure white blossom Like stainless snow is seen; And all earth's genial bosom Is clothed with varied green. The fragrant may is blooming, The yellow cowslip blows; Among its leaves entombing Peeps forth the pale primrose. The kingcup flowers and daisies Are opening hard by; And many another raises Its head, to please and die. I love the gay wild flowers Waving in fresh spring air; Give me uncultured bowers Before the bright parterre! And now my letter is concluded, To do well I have striven; And though news is well-nigh excluded, I hope to be forgiven. With love to all the beautiful, And those who cannot slaughter, I sign myself, your dutiful, Affectionate Granddaughter. Charade. My first may be the firstborn, The second child may be; My second is a texture light And elegant to see: My whole do those too often write Who are from talent free. Hope in Grief. Tell me not that death of grief Is the only sure relief. Tell me not that hope when dead Leaves a void that nought can fill, Gnawings that may not be fed. Tell me not there is no skill That can bind the breaking heart, That can soothe the bitter smart, When we find ourselves betrayed, When we find ourselves forsaken, By those for whom we would have laid Our young lives down, nor wished to waken. Say not that life is to all But a gaily coloured pall, Hiding with its deceitful glow The hearts that break beneath it, Engulphing as they anguished flow The scalding tears that seethe it. Say not, vain this world's turmoil, Vain its trouble and its toil, All its hopes and fears are vain, Long, unmitigated pain. What though we should be deceived By the friend that we love best? All in this world have been grieved, Yet many have found rest. Our present life is as the night, Our future as the morning light: Surely the night will pass away, And surely will uprise the day. Song. [I saw her; she was lovely] I saw her; she was lovely, And bright her eyes of blue, Whilst merrily her white white hands Over the harp-strings flew. I saw her and I loved her, I loved her for my pain, For her heart was given to another Not to return again. Again I saw her pacing Down the cathedral aisle; The bridal wreath was in her hair, And on her lips a smile; A quiet smile and holy, Meet for a holy place, A smile of certain happiness That lighted up her face. And once, once more I saw her, Kneeling beside a bed; The bright sun's rays were shining there, And shone upon the dead; From the body of her husband Earth's gloom they chased away, And she gazed on him without a tear, And hailed the coming day. Praise of Love. And shall Love cease? Ask thine own heart, O Woman, Thy heart that beats restlessly on for ever! All earthly things shall pass away and human, But Love's divine: annihilated never, It binds and nought shall sever. Oh! it is Love makes the world habitable, Love is a foretaste of our promised Heaven; Though sometimes robed in white, sometimes in sable, It still is Love, and still some joy is given, Although the heart be riven. And who would give Love's joy to 'scape its paining? Yea, who would lose its sorrow and its gladness? Then let us bear its griefs without complaining:— This only earthly passion is not madness, Nor leads to dearth and sadness. Love is all happiness, Love is all beauty, Love is the crown of flaxen heads and hoary, Love is the only everlasting duty, And Love is chronicled in endless story, And leads to endless glory. “I have fought a good fight.” “Who art thou that comest with a stedfast face Thro' the hushed arena to the burying-place?” “I am one whose footprints marked upon the sand Cry in blood for vengeance on a guilty land.” “How are these thy garments white as whitest snow Tho' thy blood hath touched them in its overflow?” “My blood cannot stain them, nor my tears make white; One than I more mighty, He hath made them bright.” “Say, do thy wounds pain thee open every one, Wounds that now are glowing clearer than the sun?” “Nay, they are my gladness unalloyed by grief; Like a desert fountain, or a long relief.” “When the lion had thee in his deadly clasp, Was there then no terror in thy stifled gasp?” “Tho' I felt the crushing, and the grinding teeth, He was with me ever, He Who comforteth.” “Didst thou hear the shouting, as of a great flood, Crying out for vengeance, crying out for blood?” “I heard it in silence, and was not afraid, While for the mad people silently I prayed.” “Did their hate not move thee? art thou heedless then Of the fear of children and the curse of men?” “God looked down upon me from the Heaven above, And I did not tremble, happy in His Love.” Wishes: Sonnet. Oh! would that I were very far away Among the lanes, with hedges all around, Happily listening to the dreamy sound Of distant sheep-bells, smelling the new hay And all the wild-flowers scattered in my way: Or would that I were lying on some mound Where shade and butterflies and thyme abound, Beneath the trees, upon a sunny day: Or would I strolled beside the mighty sea, The sea before, and the tall cliffs behind; While winds from the warm south might tell to me How health and joy for all men are designed:— But be I where I may, would I had thee, And heard thy gentle voice, my Mother kind. Eleanor. Cherry-red her mouth was, Morning-blue her eye, Lady-slim her little waist Rounded prettily; And her sweet smile of gladness Made every heart rejoice; But sweeter even than her smile The tones were of her voice. Sometimes she spoke, sometimes she sang; And evermore the sound Floated, a dreamy melody, Upon the air around; As tho' a wind were singing Far up beside the sun, Till sound and warmth and glory Were blended all in one. Her hair was long and golden, And clustered unconfined Over a forehead high and white That spoke a noble mind. Her little hand, her little foot Were ready evermore To hurry forth to meet a friend; She smiling at the door. But if she sang, or if she spoke, 'Twas music soft and grand, As tho' a distant singing sea Broke on a tuneful strand; As tho' a blessed Angel Were singing a glad song, Half way between the earth and Heaven Joyfully borne along. Isidora. /See Maturin's “Melmoth.”/ Love, whom I have loved too well, Turn thy face away from me; For I heed nor Heaven nor Hell While mine eyes can look on thee. Do not answer, do not speak, For thy voice can make me weak. I must choose 'twixt God and man, And I dare not hesitate: Oh how little is life's span, And Eternity how great! Go out from me; for I fear Mine own strength while thou art here. Husband, leave me; but know this: I would gladly give my soul So that thine might dwell in bliss Free from the accursed control, So that thou mightest go hence In a hopeful penitence. Yea, from Hell I would look up, And behold thee in thy place, Drinking of the living cup, With the joy-look on thy face, And the Light that shines alone From the Glory of the Throne. But how could my endless loss Be thine everlasting gain? Shall thy palm grow from my cross? Shall thine ease be in my pain? Yea, thine own soul witnesseth Thy life is not in my death. It were vain that I should die; That we thus should perish both; Thou would'st gain no peace thereby; And in truth I should be loath By the loss of my salvation To increase thy condemnation. Little infant, his and mine, Would that I were as thou art; Nothing breaks that sleep of thine, And ah! nothing breaks thy heart; And thou knowest nought of strife, The heart's death for the soul's life. None misdoubt thee; none misdeem Of thy wishes and thy will. All thy thoughts are what they seem, Very pure and very still; And thou fearest not the voice That once made thy heart rejoice. Oh how calm thou art, my child! I could almost envy thee. Thou hast neither wept nor smiled, Thou that sleepest quietly. Would I also were at rest With the one that I love best. Husband, go. I dare not hearken To thy words, or look upon Those despairing eyes that darken Down on me—but he is gone. Nay, come back; and be my fate As thou wilt—it is too late. I have conquered; it is done; Yea, the death-struggle is o'er, And the hopeless quiet won!— I shall see his face no more!— And mine eyes are waxing dim Now they cannot look on him. And my heart-pulses are growing Very weak; and thro' my whole Life-blood a slow chill is going:— Blessed Saviour, take my soul To Thy Paradise and care;— Paradise, will he be there? The Novice. I love one, and he loveth me: Who sayeth this? who deemeth this? And is this thought a cause of bliss, Or source of misery? The loved may die, or he may change: And if he die thou art bereft; Or if he alter, nought is left Save life that seemeth strange. A weary life, a hopeless life, Full of all ill and fear-oppressed; A weary life that looks for rest Alone after death's strife. And love's joy hath no quiet even; It evermore is variable. Its gladness is like war in Hell, More than repose in Heaven. Yea, it is as a poison cup That holds one quick fire-draught within; For when the life seems to begin The slow death looketh up. Then bring me to a solitude Where love may neither come nor go; Where very peaceful waters flow, And roots are found for food; Where the wild honey-bee booms by; And trees and bushes freely give Ripe fruit and nuts; there I would live, And there I fain would die. There Autumn leaves may make my grave, And little birds sing over it; And there cool twilight winds may flit And shadowy branches wave. Immalee: /See Maturin's “Melmoth.”/ Sonnet. I gather thyme upon the sunny hills, And its pure fragrance ever gladdens me, And in my mind having tranquillity I smile to see how my green basket fills. And by clear streams I gather daffodils; And in dim woods find out the cherry-tree, And take its fruit, and the wild strawberry, And nuts, and honey; and live free from ills. I dwell on the green earth, 'neath the blue sky, Birds are my friends, and leaves my rustling roof; The deer are not afraid of me, and I Hear the wild goat, and hail its hastening hoof; The squirrels sit perked as I pass them by, And even the watchful hare stands not aloof. Lady Isabella. Heart warm as Summer, fresh as Spring, Gracious as Autumn's harvesting, Pure as the Winter snows; as white A hand as lilies in sun-light; Eyes glorious as a midnight star; Hair shining as the chestnuts are; A step firm and majestical; A voice singing and musical; A soft expression, kind address; Tears for another's heaviness; Bright looks; an action full of grace; A perfect form, a perfect face; All these become a woman well, And these had Lady Isabelle. Night and Death. Now the sun-lit hours are o'er, Rise up from thy shadowy shore, Happy Night, whom Chaos bore. Better is the peaceful treasure Of thy musings without measure, Than the day's unquiet pleasure. Bring the holy moon; so pale She herself seems but a veil For the sun, where no clouds sail. Bring the stars, thy progeny; Each a little lamp on high To light up an azure sky. Sounds incomprehensible In the shining planets dwell Of thy sister Queen to tell. Of that sister Nature saith, She hath power o'er life and breath; And her name is written Death. She is fairer far than thou; Grief her head can never bow, Joy is stamped upon her brow. She is full of gentleness, And of faith and hope; distress Finds in her forgetfulness. In her arms who lieth down Never more is seen to frown, Tho' he wore a thorny crown. Whoso sigheth in unrest If his head lean on her breast Witnesseth she is the best. All the riches of the earth Weighed by her are nothing worth; She is the eternal birth. In her treasure-house are found Stored abundantly around Almsdeeds done without a sound; Long forbearance; patient will; Fortitude in midst of ill; Hope, when even fear grew still; Kindness given again for hate; Hearts resigned tho' desolate; Meekness, which is truly great; Bitter tears of penitence; Changeless love's omnipotence:— And nought lacketh recompense. In her house no tainted thing Winneth any entering; There the poor have comforting. There they wait a little time Till the angel-uttered chime Sound the eternal matin-prime. Then, upraised in joyfulness, They shall know her; and confess She is blessed and doth bless. When earth's fleeting day is flown All created things shall own, Death is Life, and Death alone. “Young men aye were fickle found Since summer trees were leafy.” Go in peace my Beloved; tho' never again Shall I feel in thy presence strange joy and sweet pain; Go in peace my Beloved; perhaps thou may'st yet Find a young heart to love thee that need not forget. In glory and beauty and smiles thou shalt go, And I shall remain in my wearisome woe. Oh! thine is the rose on a bright summer morn Full of perfume and blushes;—and mine is the thorn. And thine is the sun-light, and mine is the cloud; And thine is the feasting, and mine is the shroud. And thou shalt have gladness and honour's increase; And I in my cool silent grave shall have peace. But so it is fitting, and so let it be; The praise be thy portion, the shame be for me. Ah! why should I chide thee and struggle in vain? For love, once recalled, is not given again. Thy word is forgotten, and broken thy vow; If I pray or reproach thee thou heedest not now. I would I could hate thee, false love; but in truth How can I abhor the delight of my youth? Oh! happy the maiden whose beautiful strength Shall win thy proud heart and subdue it at length! Yet tho' she be true, what hath she more than I? She may live but for thee, and for thee I shall die. The faith which endures and is mighty in death Is more real, to my thinking, than words which are breath. There are many fair women will court thee and live; But who, broken-hearted, will die and forgive? By the love that I bear thee, the hopes that are flown, The heart that lies bleeding, the life left alone,— Remember, remember the dear vanished time, In thy far-distant country and sun-gladdened clime. The Lotus-Eaters: Ulysses to Penelope. In a far-distant land they dwell, Incomprehensible, Who love the shadow more than light, More than the sun the moon, Cool evening more than noon, Pale silver more than gold that glitters bright. A dark cloud overhangs their land Like a mighty hand, Never moving from above it; A cool shade and moist and dim, With a twilight-purple rim, And they love it. And sometimes it giveth rain, But soon it ceaseth as before, And earth drieth up again; Then the dews rise more and more, Till it filleth, dropping o'er; But no forked lightnings flit, And no thunders roll in it. Thro' the land a river flows; With a sleepy sound it goes; Such a drowsy noise, in sooth, Those who will not listen, hear not; But if one is wakeful, fear not; It shall lull him to repose, Bringing back the dream's of youth. Hemlock groweth, poppy bloweth In the fields where no man moweth; And the vine is full of wine And are full of milk the kine, And the hares are all secure, And the birds are wild no more, And the forest-trees wax old, And winds stir, or hot, or cold, And yet no man taketh care, All things resting everywhere. Sonnet from the Psalms. All thro' the livelong night I lay awake Watering my couch with tears of heaviness. None stood beside me in my sore distress;— Then cried I to my heart: If thou wilt, break, But be thou still; no moaning will I make, Nor ask man's help, nor kneel that he may bless. So I kept silence in my haughtiness, Till lo! the fire was kindled, and I spake Saying: Oh that I had wings like to a dove, Then would I flee away and be at rest: I would not pray for friends, or hope, or love, But still the weary throbbing of my breast; And, gazing on the changeless heavens above, Witness that such a quietness is best. Song. [The stream moaneth as it floweth] The stream moaneth as it floweth, The wind sigheth as it bloweth, Leaves are falling, Autumn goeth, Winter cometh back again; And the air is very chilly, And the country rough and hilly, And I shiver in the rain. Who will help me? Who will love me? Heaven sets forth no light above me; Ancient memories reprove me, Long-forgotten feelings move me, I am full of heaviness. Earth is cold, too cold the sea; Whither shall I turn and flee? Is there any hope for me? Any ease for my heart-aching? Any sleep that hath no waking? Any night without day-breaking? Any rest from weariness? Hark! the wind is answering: Hark! the running stream replieth: There is rest for him that dieth; In the grave whoever lieth Nevermore hath sorrowing. Holy slumber, holy quiet, Close the eyes and still the riot; And the brain forgets its thought, And the heart forgets its beating.— Earth and earthly things are fleeting, There is what all men have sought; Long, unchangeable repose, Lulling us from many woes. A Counsel. Oh weep for the glory departed That comes not again; And weep for the friends hollow-hearted Ye cared for in vain; And weep for the roses that perished Ere Summer had fled; For hopes that ye vainly have cherished;— But not for the dead. Nay mourn not for them: they have ended All labours and woes; Their hopes now of glory are blended With perfect repose. And tell me, this thing that is given, Shall it not suffice? They wait for the gladness of Heaven, And have Paradise. The World's Harmonies. Oh listen, listen; for the Earth Hath silent melody; Green grasses are her lively chords, And blossoms; and each tree, Chestnut and oak and sycamore, Makes solemn harmony. Oh listen, listen; for the Sea Is calling unto us; Her notes are the broad liquid waves Mighty and glorious. Lo, the first man and the last man Hath heard, shall hearken thus. The Sun on which men cannot look Its splendour is so strong; Which wakeneth life and giveth life Rolling in light along, From day-dawn to dim eventide Sings the eternal song. And the Moon taketh up the hymn, And the Stars answer all; And all the Clouds and all the Winds And all the Dews that fall And Frost and fertilizing Rain Are mutely musical. Fishes and Beasts and feathered Fowl Swell the eternal chant, That riseth through the lower air, Over the rainbow slant, Up through the unseen palace-gates, Fearlessly jubilant. Before the everlasting Throne It is acceptable; It hath no pause or faltering; The Angels know it well; Yea, in the highest heaven of heavens Its sound is audible. Yet than the voice of the whole World There is a sweeter voice, That maketh all the Cherubim And Seraphim rejoice; That all the blessèd Spirits hail With undivided choice; That crieth at the golden door And gaineth entrance in; That the palm-branch and radiant crown And glorious throne may win;— The lowly prayer of a poor man Who turneth from his sin. Lines given with a Penwiper. I have compassion on the carpeting, And on your back I have compassion too. The splendid Brussels web is suffering In the dimmed lustre of each glowing hue; And you the everlasting altering Of your position with strange aches must rue. Behold, I come the carpet to preserve, And save your spine from a continual curve. The last Answer. She turned round to me with her steadfast eyes: “I tell you I have looked upon the dead; “Have kissed the brow and the cold lips;” she said; “Have called upon the sleeper to arise; “He loved me, yet he stirred not; on this wise, “Not bowing in weak agony my head, “But all too sure of what life is, to dread, “Learned I that love and hope are fallacies.” She gazed quite calmly on me; and I felt Awed and astonished and almost afraid: For what was I to have admonished her? Then, being full of doubt and fear, I knelt, And tears came to my eyes even as I prayed: But she, meanwhile, only grew statelier. One of the Dead. Paler, not quite so fair as in her life, She lies upon the bed, perfectly still; Her little hands clasped with a patient will Upon her bosom, swelling without strife; An honoured virgin, a most blameless wife. The roses lean upon the window sill, That she trained once; their sweets the hot air fill, And make the death-apartment odour-rife. Her meek white hands folded upon her breast, Her gentle eyes closed in the long last sleep, She lieth down in her unbroken rest; Her kin, kneeling around, a vigil keep, Venting their grief in low sobs unrepressed:— Friends, she but slumbers, wherefore do ye weep? “The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.” Woe for the young who say that life is long, Who turn from the sun-rising to the west, Who feel no pleasure and can find no rest, Who in the morning sigh for evensong. Their hearts weary because of this world's wrong, Yearn with a thousand longings unexpressed; They have a wound no mortal ever drest, An ill than all earth's remedies more strong. For them the fount of gladness hath run dry, And in all nature is no pleasant thing; For them there is no glory in the sky, No sweetness in the breezes' murmuring; They say: The peace of heaven is placed too high, And this earth changeth and is perishing. “I do set My bow in the cloud.” The roses bloom too late for me; The violets I shall not see; Even the snowdrops will not come Till I have passed from home to home; From home on earth to home in heaven, Here penitent and there forgiven. Mourn not, my Father, that I seek One Who is strong when I am weak. Through the dark passage, verily, His rod and staff shall comfort me; He shall support me in the strife Of death, that dieth into life; He shall support me; He receive My soul when I begin to live, And more than I can ask for give. He from the heaven-gates built above Hath looked on me in perfect love. From the heaven-walls to me He calls To come and dwell within those walls; With Cherubim and Seraphim And Angels; yea, beholding Him. His care for me is more than mine, Father; His love is more than thine. Sickness and death I have from thee, From Him have immortality. He giveth gladness where He will, Yet chasteneth His belovèd still. Then tell me; is it not enough To feel that when the path is rough, And the sky dark, and the rain cold, His promise standeth as of old? When heaven and earth have passed away, Only His righteous word shall stay, And we shall know His will is best. Behold; He is a Haven Rest, A Sheltering Rock, a Hiding Place, For runners steadfast in the race; Who, toiling for a little space, Had light through faith when sight grew dim, And offered all their world to Him. “O Death where is thy Sting?” She sleepeth: would ye wake her if ye could? Is her face sad that ye should pity her? Did Death come to her like a messenger From a far land where is not any good? I tell ye nay: but, having understood That God is Love, Death was her harbinger[The rest of the manuscript is missing from the notebook.] Undine. She did not answer him again But walked straight to the door; Her hand nor trembled on the lock, Nor her foot on the floor, But as she stood up steadily She turned, and looked once more. She turned, and looked on him once more: Her face was very pale; And from her forehead her long hair Fell back like a thick veil; But, though her lips grew white, the fire Of her eyes did not fail. Then as she fixed her eyes on him Old thoughts came back again Of the dear rambles long ago Through meadow-land and lane, When all the woods were full of flowers, And all the fields of grain. When all the birds were full of song Except the turtle dove; And that sat cooing tenderly In the green boughs above; When they hoped the same hopes, and when He told her of his love. Old memories came back to her Of what once made her glad, Till her heart seemed to stand quite still, And every pulse she had: Then the blood rose up to her brain And she was almost mad. Yet still she stood there steadily And looked him in the face; There was no tear upon her cheek; Upon her brow no trace Of the agonizing strife within, The shame and the disgrace. And so she stayed a little while Until she turned once more, Without a single sob or sigh; But her heart felt quite sore: The spirit had been broken, and The hope of life was o'er. Lady Montrevor. (See Maturin's “Wild Irish Boy.”) I do not look for love that is a dream: I only seek for courage to be still; To bear my grief with an unbending will, And when I am a-weary not to seem. Let the round world roll on; let the sun beam; Let the wind blow, and let the rivers fill The everlasting sea; and on the hill The palms almost touch heaven, as children deem. And though young Spring and Summer pass away, And Autumn and cold Winter come again; And though my soul, being tired of its pain, Pass from the ancient earth; and though my clay Return to dust; my tongue shall not complain: No man shall mock me after this my day. Floral Teaching. O ye red-blushing summer roses, ye Who are like queens, crowned with a rich perfume, In whose deep heart there is no shade of gloom, Who are a pasture for the honey-bee; Surely your days and nights pass happily: And when the earth, your mother, doth resume Your little lives, do ye not think the tomb Is full of soft leaves and looks pleasantly? So be it with me: through life so may I deem That this world's course is ordered well, and give My help to others and my loving heed. Then when the day comes that it is decreed I am to die, may I not cease to live, But rest awhile waiting the morning beam. “Death is swallowed up in Victory.” “Tell me: doth it not grieve thee to lie here, And see the cornfields waving not for thee, Just in the waxing Summer of the year?” “I fade from earth; and lo! along with me The season that I love will fade away: How should I look for Autumn longingly?” “Yet Autumn beareth fruit whilst day by day The leaves grow browner with a mellow hue, Declining to a beautiful decay.” “Decay is death, with which I have to do, And see it near; behold, it is more good Than length of days and length of sorrow too.” “But thy heart hath not dwelt in solitude: Many have loved and love thee; dost not heed Free love, for which in vain have others sued?” “I thirst for love, love is mine only need, Love such as none hath borne me, nor can bear, True love that prompteth thought and word and deed.” “Here it is not: why seek it otherwhere? Nay, bow thy head, and own that on this earth Are many goodly things, and sweet, and fair.” “There are tears in man's laughter; in his mirth There is a fearful forward look; and lo! An infant's cry gives token of its birth.” “I mark the ocean of Time ebb and flow: He who hath care one day, and is perplext Tomorrow may have joy in place of woe.” “Evil becomes good; and to this annext Good becomes evil; speak of it no more; My heart is wearied and my spirit vext.” “Is there no place it grieves thee to give o'er? Is there no home thou lov'st, and so wouldst fain Tarry a little longer at the door?” “I must go hence and not return again; But the friends whom I have shall come to me, And dwell together with me safe from pain.” “Where is that mansion mortals cannot see? Behold the tombs are full of worms; shalt thou Rise thence and soar up skywards gloriously?” “Even as the planets shine we know not how, We shall be raised then; changed, yet still the same; Being made like Christ; yea, being as He is now.” “Thither thou goest whence no man ever came: Death's voyagers return not; and in Death There is no room for speech or sigh or fame.” “There is room for repose that comforteth; There weariness is not; and there content Broodeth for ever, and hope hovereth.” “When the stars fall, and when the graves are rent, Shalt thou have safety? shalt thou look for life When the great light of the broad sun is spent?” “These elements shall consummate their strife, This heaven and earth shall shrivel like a scroll And then be re-created, beauty-rife.” “Who shall abide it when from pole to pole The world's foundations shall be overthrown? Who shall abide to scan the perfect whole?” “He who hath strength given to him, not his own; He who hath faith in that which is not seen, And patient hope; who trusts in love alone.” “Yet thou! the death-struggle must intervene Ere thou win rest; think better of it; think Of all that is and shall be, and hath been.” “The cup my Father giveth me to drink, Shall I not take it meekly? though my heart Tremble a moment, it shall never shrink.” “Satan will wrestle with thee, when thou art In the last agony; and Death will bring Sins to remembrance ere thy spirit part.” “In that great hour of unknown suffering God shall be with me, and His arm made bare Shall fight for me: yea, underneath His wing I shall lie safe at rest and freed from care.” Death. “The grave-worm revels now” Upon the pure white brow, And on the eyes so dead and dim, And on each putrifying limb, And on the neck 'neath the long hair; Now from the rosy lips He damp corruption sips, Banquetting everywhere. Creeping up and down through the silken tresses That once were smoothed by her husband's caresses, In her mouth, and on her breast Where the babe might never rest In giving birth to whom she lost her life; She gave all and she gave in vain, Nor saw the purchase of her pain, Poor mother and poor wife. Was she too young to die? Nay, young in sorrow and in years, Her heart was old in faith and love; Her eyes were ever fixed above, They were not dimmed by tears. And as the time went swiftly by She was even as a stately palm Beside still waters, where a dove Broodeth in perfect calm. Yea, she was as a gentle breeze To which a thousand tones are given; To tell of freshness to the trees, Of roses to the honey-bees, Of Summer to the distant seas, And unto all of Heaven. They rest together in one grave, The mother and her infant child, The holy and the undefiled: Let none weep that ye could not save So much of beauty from the earth; It is not death ye see, though they Pass into foulness and decay; It is the second birth. A Hopeless Case. (Nydia.) All night I dream of that which cannot be: And early in the morning I awake My whole heart saddened for a vision's sake. I in my sleep have joy; but woe is me! Thro' the long day the shadowy pleasures flee And are not: wherefore I would gladly take Some warm and poppied potion that might make My slumbers long which pass so pleasantly. And if I slept and never woke again, But dreamed on with a happy consciousness Of grass and flowers and perfect rest from pain, I would leave hope a thousand times found vain, And own a twilight solitude doth bless Shut in from cold and wind and storm of rain. Ellen Middleton. Raise me; undraw the curtain; that is well. Put up the casement; I would see once more The golden sun-set flooding sea and shore; And hearken to the solemn evening-bell That ringeth out my spirit like a knell. The tree of love a bitter fruitage bore, Sweet at the rind but rotten at the core, Pointing to heaven and bringing down to hell. I will not name His name, lest the young life That dieth at my heart should live again; Strengthening me to renew the weary strife That ceaseth,—is this death? It is not pain. Write on my grave: Here lieth a lone wife Whose faith was hidden and whose love was vain. St. Andrew's Church. I listen to the holy antheming That riseth in thy walls continually, What while the organ pealeth solemnly And white-robed men and boys stand up to sing. I ask my heart with a sad questioning: “What lov'st thou here?” and my heart answers me: “Within the shadows of this sanctuary To watch and pray is a most blessed thing.” To watch and pray, false heart? it is not so: Vanity enters with thee, and thy love Soars not to Heaven, but grovelleth below. Vanity keepeth guard, lest good should reach Thy hardness; not the echoes from above Can rule thy stubborn feelings or can teach. Grown Cold. Sonnet. An old man asked me: What is Love? I turned In mirth away, and would not answer him; He filled a cup of wine up to the brim, And yet no sparkling in its depths discerned. Methought a death fire in his weak eyes burned While he beholding brightness called it dim; He sat and chuckled: 'twas a ghastly whim In one whose spirit had so little learned. So shall it be with me; but so not I Shall question: certainly the blessèd thought Of Love shall linger, when itself is gone. Oh nest of thorns for dove to brood upon! Oh painful throbbings of a heart untaught To rest when all its gladness goeth by! Zara. (see Maturin's “Women.”) The pale sad face of her I wronged Upbraids and follows me for ever: The silent mouth grows many-tongued To chide me; like some solemn river Whose every wave hath found a tone To reason of one truth alone. She loved and was beloved again: Why did I spoil her paradise? Oh fleeting joy and lasting pain! Oh folly of the heart and eyes! I loved him more than all; and he, He also hath forsaken me. How have I wearied thee false friend? Answer me, wherein have I erred That so our happy loves should end? Was it in thought, or deed, or word? My soul lay bare to thee; disclose The hidden fountain of my woes. The Lady Moon is all too bright Loftily seated in the skies. They say that love once dimmed her light, But surely such are poets' lies. Who knoweth that she ever shone On rosy cheeked Endymion? Narcissus looked on his own shade, And sickened for its loveliness. Grasping, he saw its beauties fade And stretch out into nothingness. He died, rejecting his own good, And Echo mourned in solitude. But wherefore am I left alone? What was my sin, to merit this? Of all my friends there is not one I slighted in my happiness, My joyful days—oh, very white One face pursues me day and night. She loved him even as I love, For she is dying for his sake. Oh happy hope that looks above! Oh happy heart that still can break! I cannot die, though hope is dead; He spurned me, and my heart but bled. Therefore because she did not speak, Being strong to die and make no sign; Because her courage waxed not weak, Strengthened with love as with new wine; Because she stooped not while she bore, He will return to her once more. Perhaps he still may bring her health, May call her colour back again; While I shall pine in fame and wealth, Owning that such as these are vain, And envying her happier fate:— And yet methinks it is too late. Thou doubly false to her and me, Boast of her death and my despair. Boast if thou canst: on land, on sea, I will be with thee everywhere; My soul, let loose by mine own deed, Shall make thee fear who would'st not heed. Come, thou glad hour of vengeance, come, When I may dog him evermore, May track him to his distant home: Yea, though he flee from shore to shore I will be there, the pallid ghost Of love and hope for ever lost. Old memories shall make him sad, And thin his hair and change his mien; He shall remember what he had, And dream of what he might have been, Till he shall long for death; yet shrink From the cold cup that I shall drink. Who drinketh of that potent draught May never set it down again. What matter if one wept or laughed? It killeth joy and numbeth pain: It hath sleep for the sorrowful, And for the sick a perfect lull. A drowsy lull, a heavy sleep: Haply it may give such to me: And if my grave place were dug deep Beneath the cold earth, verily Such quietness I would not break, Not for my cherished vengeance' sake. Bring me the cup: behold, I choose For all my portion nothingness. Bring me the cup: I would not lose One drop of its forgetfulness. On the grave brink I turn and think Of thee, before I stoop to drink. When the glad Summer time is past Shalt thou not weary of thy life And turn to seek that home at last Where never enters fear nor strife? Yea, at length, in the Autumn weather, Shall not we twain repose together? Ruin. Amid the shade of a deserted hall I stand and think on much that hath been lost. How long it is since other step has cross'd This time-worn floor; that tapestry is all Worm-eaten; and those columns rise up tall Yet crumbling to decay; where banners toss'd Thin spiders' webs hang now; and bitter frost Has even killed the flowers upon the wall. Yet once this was a home brim full of life, Full of the hopes and fears and love of youth, Full of love's language speaking without sound: Here honour was enshrined and kindly truth; Hither the young lord brought his blushing wife, And here her bridal garlands were unbound. I sit among green shady valleys oft Listening to echo-winds sighing of woe; The grass and flowers are strong and sweet below, Yea, I am tired and the smooth turf is soft. I sit and think and never look aloft Save to the tops of a tall poplar row That glisten in the wind, whispering low Of sudden sorrow reaching those who laughed. A very drowsy fountain bubbles near Catching pale sunbeams o'er it wandering; Its waters are so clear the stones look through:— Then sitting by its lazy stream I hear Silence more loud than any other thing, What time the trees weep o'er me honeydew. Listen, and I will tell you of a face Not lovely, but made beautiful by mind; Lighted up with dark eyes in which you find All womanly affections have their place; Upon her even brow there is no trace Of passion; many fragrant blossoms bind Her hair glossy and golden; like a blind It shadows her round cheeks blush full of grace. I know now how it is, but it was so: And when I think upon her bosom heaving, And her full glistening eyes looking on me When the poor bird was struggling; I still see The throbbing tenderness, the virgin glow, And dream on, not at rest and yet believing. Wouldst thou give me a heavy jewelled crown And purple mantle and embroidered vest? Dear Child, the colours of the glorious west Are far more gorgeous when the sun sinks down. The diadem would only make me frown With its own weight; nay, give me for my crest Pale violets dreaming in perfect rest, Or rather leaves withered to Autumn brown. A purple flowing mantle would but hinder My careless walk, and an embroidered robe Would shame me: what is the best man who stepped On earth, more than the naked worm that crept Over its surface? Earth shall be a cinder; Where shall be then the beauty of the globe? I said within myself: I am a fool To sigh ever for that which being gone Cannot return: the sun shines as it shone; Rejoice:—but who can be made glad by rule? My heart and soul and spirit are no tool To play with and direct; my cheek is wan With memory; and ever and anon I weep feeling life is a weary school. There is much noise and bustle in the street; It used to be so, and it is so now; All are the same, and will be many a year. Spirit, that canst not break and wilt not bow, Fear not the cold, thou who hast borne the heat;— Die if thou wilt; but what hast thou to fear? Methinks the ills of life I fain would shun; But then I must shun life which is a blank: Even in my childhood oft my spirit sank Thinking of all that had still to be done. Among my many friends there is not one Like her with whom I sat upon the bank Willow-o'er-shadowed; from whose lips I drank A love more pure than streams that sing and run. But many times that joy has cost a sigh; And many times I in my heart have sought For the old comfort, and not found it yet: Surely in that calm day when I shall die The painful thought will be a blessed thought, And I shall sorrow that I must forget. Strange voices sing among the planets which Move on for ever; in the old sea's foam There is a prophecy; in Heaven's blue dome Great beacon fires are lighted; black as pitch Is night, and yet star jewels make it rich; And if the moon lights up her cloudy home The darkness flees, and forth strange gleamings roam Lighting up hill and vale and mound and ditch. Earth is full of all questions that all ask; And she alone of heavy silence full Answereth not: what is it severeth Us from the spirits that we would be with? Or is it that our fleshly ear is dull, And our own shadow hides light with a mask? “Sleep, sleep, happy child; “All creation slept and smiled.” Blake. Sleep, sleep, happy one; Thy night is but just begun. Sleep in peace; still angels keep Holy watches o'er thy sleep. Softest breasts are pillowing, Softest wings are shadowing Thy calm slumber; little child, Sleep in thy white robes undefiled. There is no more aching now In thy heart or in thy brow. The red blood upon thy breast Cannot scare away thy rest. Though thy hands are clasped as when A man thou prayedst among men, Thy pains are lulled, thy tears are dried, And thy wants are satisfied. Sleep, sleep; what quietness After the world's noise is this! Sleep on, where the hush and shade Like a veil are round thee laid. At thy head a cross is hewn Whereon shines the Advent moon: Through all the hours of the night Its shadow rests on thee aright. In temptation thou wert firm; Now have patience with the worm. Yet a little while, and he And death and sin shall bow to thee. Yet a little while, and thou Shalt have a crown upon thy brow, And a palm branch in thy hand Where the holy angels stand. Sleep, sleep, till the chime Sound of the last matin prime: Sleep on until the morn Of another Advent dawn. What Sappho would have said had her leap cured instead of killing her. Love, Love, that having found a heart And left it, leav'st it desolate;— Love, Love, that art more strong than Hate, More lasting and more full of art;— O blessèd Love, return, return, Brighten the flame that needs must burn. Among the stately lilies pale, Among the roses flushing red, I seek a flower meet for my head, A wreath wherewith to bind my veil: I seek in vain; a shadow-pain Lies on my heart; and all in vain. The rose hath too much life in it; The lily is too much at rest. Surely a blighted rose were best, Or cankered lily flower more fit; Or purple violet, withering While yet the year is in its spring. I walk down by the river side Where the low willows touch the stream; Beneath the ripple and sun-gleam The slippery cold fishes glide, Where flags and reeds and rushes lave Their roots in the unsullied wave. Methinks this is a drowsy place: Disturb me not; I fain would sleep: The very winds and waters keep Their voices under; and the race Of Time seems to stand still, for here Is night or twilight all the year. A very holy hushedness Broods here for ever: like a dove That, having built its nest above A quiet place, feels the excess Of calm sufficient, and would fain Not wake, but drowse on without pain. And slumbering on its mossy nest Haply hath dreams of pleasant Spring; And in its vision prunes its wing And takes swift flight, yet is at rest. Yea, is at rest: and still the calm Is wrapped around it like a charm. I would have quiet too in truth, And here will sojourn for a while. Lo; I have wandered many a mile, Till I am foot-sore in my youth. I will lie down; and quite forget The doubts and fears that haunt me yet. My pillow underneath my head Shall be green grass; thick fragrant leaves My canopy; the spider weaves Meet curtains for my narrow bed; And the dew can but cool my brow That is so dry and burning now. Ah, would that it could reach my heart, And fill the void that is so dry And aches and aches;—but what am I To shrink from my self-purchased part? It is in vain; is all in vain; I must go forth and bear my pain. Must bear my pain, till Love shall turn To me in pity and come back. His footsteps left a smouldering track When he went forth, that still doth burn. Oh come again, thou pain divine, Fill me and make me wholly thine. On Keats. A garden in a garden: a green spot Where all is green: most fitting slumber-place For the strong man grown weary of a race Soon over. Unto him a goodly lot Hath fallen in fertile ground; there thorns are not, But his own daisies: silence, full of grace, Surely hath shed a quiet on his face: His earth is but sweet leaves that fall and rot. What was his record of himself, ere he Went from us? Here lies one whose name was writ In water: while the chilly shadows flit Of sweet Saint Agnes' Eve; while basil springs, His name, in every humble heart that sings, Shall be a fountain of love, verily. Have Patience. The goblets all are broken, The pleasant wine is spilt, The songs cease; if thou wilt, Listen, and hear truth spoken. We take thought for the morrow, And know not we shall see it; We look on death with sorrow, And cannot flee it. Youth passes like the lightning, Not to return again; Just for a little bright'ning The confines of a plain; Gilding the spires, and whitening The grave-stones and the slain. Youth passes like the odour From the white rose's cup, When the hot sun drinks up The dew that overflowed her: Then life forsakes the petals That had been very fair; No beauty lingers there, And no bee settles. But when the rose is dead, And the leaves fallen; And when the earth has spread A snow-white pall on; The thorn remains, once hidden By the green growth above it; A darksome guest unbidden, With none to love it. Manhood is turbulent, And old age tires; That, hath no still content, This, no desires. The present hath even less Joy than the past, And more cares fret it:— Life is a weariness From first to last:— Let us forget it. Fill high and deep:—but how? The goblets all are broken. Nay then, have patience now: For this is but a token We soon shall have no need Of such to cheer us: The palm-branches, decreed, And crowns, to be our meed, Are very near us. To Lalla, reading my verses topsy-turvy. Darling little Cousin, With your thoughtful look Reading topsy-turvy From a printed book English hieroglyphics, More mysterious To you, than Egyptian Ones would be to us;— Leave off for a minute Studying, and say What is the impression That those marks convey? Only solemn silence, And a wondering smile: But your eyes are lifted Unto mine the while. In their gaze so steady I can surely trace That a happy spirit Lighteth up your face. Tender, happy spirit, Innocent and pure; Teaching more than science, And than learning more. How should I give answer To that asking look? Darling little Cousin Go back to your book. Read on: if you knew it, You have cause to boast:— You are much the wisest, Though I know the most. Sonnet. [Some say that love and joy are one: and so] Some say that love and joy are one: and so They are indeed in heaven, but not on earth. Our hearts are made too narrow for the girth Of love, which is infinity; below The portion we can compass may bring woe; Of this the Church bears witness from her birth: And though a throne in heaven be more than worth Tears, it is pain that makes them overflow. Think of the utter grief that fell on them Who knew that they should see his face no more, When, strong in faith and love, he went before, Bound in the spirit, to Jerusalem, And yet the bitter parting scarcely bore, Though burning for a martyr's diadem. The last Complaint. Woe is me! an old man said Stretched upon his dying bed: Woe is me! for life is short; And one hour cannot be bought With great treasure or long thought. What have all my days been worth? Weary labour without gain, Pleasure ending in much pain, Planting that brought forth no fruit, Tree of life struck at the root, Were my portion from my birth: But my cold heart sickeneth Shrinking from the touch of death; And I fain would have again Toil and weariness and pain For a short time more on earth. Yet the time was troublesome, And the days lagged slowly on; Surely it is better so: And I cannot grieve to go Hence. How fast the shadows come:— Light and darkness both grow wan:— Is that fire? it is not heat. Cover up my face and feet; Stand back; do not speak to me: I would think how it will be When the sun is blotted from My existence, and the worm Dwells with me as friend with friend For a certain measured term. But his term will have an end: Then I shall be quite alone, Quite alone without a sound; For no wind beneath the ground Can come jarring bone with bone. Without eyes I shall behold Darkness, and shall feel the cold Without nerves, or brain, or flesh;— Oh sweet air that blowest fresh; Oh sweet stars that glimmer through The dim casement;—I shall soon Have a sod instead of you. Draw the curtains, while I wake Who shall sleep; and let me lie In the blackness, till I die; For I cannot bear to take My last look of the clear moon. Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten how one Summer night We wandered forth together with the moon, While warm winds hummed to us a sleepy tune? Have you forgotten how you praised both light And darkness; not embarrassed yet not quite At ease? and how you said the glare of noon Less pleased you than the stars? but very soon You blushed, and seemed to doubt if you were right. We wandered far and took no note of time; Till on the air there came the distant call Of church bells: we turned hastily, and yet Ere we reached home sounded a second chime. But what; have you indeed forgotten all? Ah how then is it I cannot forget? A Christmas Carol, (on the stroke of Midnight.) Thank God, thank God, we do believe, Thank God that this is Christmas Eve. Even as we kneel upon this day, Even so the ancient legends say Nearly two thousand years ago The stalled ox knelt, and even so The ass knelt full of praise which they Could not express, while we can pray. Thank God, thank God, for Christ was born Ages ago, as on this morn: In the snow-season undefiled God came to earth a little Child; He put His ancient glory by To live for us, and then to die. How shall we thank God? how shall we Thank Him and praise Him worthily? What will He have Who loved us thus, What presents will He take from us? Will He take gold, or precious heap Of gems, or shall we rather steep The air with incense, or bring myrrh? What man will be our messenger To go to Him and ask His Will? Which having learned we will fulfil Tho' He choose all we most prefer:— What man will be our messenger? Thank God, thank God, the Man is found, Sure-footed, knowing well the ground: He knows the road, for this the way He travelled once, as on this day. He is our Messenger; beside, He is our Door, and Path, and Guide; He also is our Offering, He is the Gift that we must bring. Let us kneel down with one accord And render thanks unto the Lord: For unto us a Child is born Upon this happy Christmas morn; For unto us a Son is given, Firstborn of God and Heir of Heaven. For Advent. Sweet sweet sound of distant waters falling On a parched and thirsty plain; Sweet sweet song of soaring skylark, calling On the sun to shine again; Perfume of the rose, only the fresher For past fertilizing rain; Pearls amid the sea, a hidden treasure For some daring hand to gain;— Better, dearer than all these Is the earth beneath the trees: Of a much more priceless worth Is the old, brown, common earth. Little snow-white lamb piteously bleating For thy mother far away; Saddest, sweetest nightingale retreating With thy sorrow from the day; Weary fawn whom night has overtaken, From the herd gone quite astray; Dove whose nest was rifled and forsaken In the budding month of May;— Roost upon the leafy trees; Lie on earth and take your ease: Death is better far than birth, You shall turn again to earth. Listen to the never pausing murmur Of the waves that fret the shore: See the ancient pine that stands the firmer For the storm-shock that it bore; And the moon her silver chalice filling With light from the great sun's store; And the stars which deck our temple's ceiling As the flowers deck its floor; Look and hearken while you may, For these things shall pass away: All these things shall fail and cease; Let us wait the end in peace. Let us wait the end in peace; for truly That shall cease which was before: Let us see our lamps are lighted, duly Fed with oil, nor wanting more: Let us pray while yet the Lord will hear us, For the time is almost o'er; Yea, the end of all is very near us; Yea, the Judge is at the door. Let us pray now while we may; It will be too late to pray When the quick and dead shall all Rise at the last trumpet call. Two Pursuits. A voice said: “Follow, follow:” and I rose And followed far into the dreamy night, Turning my back upon the pleasant light. It led me where the bluest water flows, And would not let me drink; where the corn grows I dared not pause, but went uncheered by sight Or touch; until at length in evil plight It left me, wearied out with many woes. Some time I sat as one bereft of sense: But soon another voice from very far Called: “Follow, follow:” and I rose again. Now on my night has dawned a blessèd star; Kind, steady hands my sinking steps sustain, And will not leave me till I shall go hence. Looking forward. Sleep, let me sleep, for I am sick of care; Sleep, let me sleep, for my pain wearies me. Shut out the light; thicken the heavy air With drowsy incense; let a distant stream Of music lull me, languid as a dream, Soft as the whisper of a Summer sea. Pluck me no rose that groweth on a thorn, Nor myrtle white and cold as snow in June, Fit for a virgin on her marriage morn: But bring me poppies brimmed with sleepy death, And ivy choking what it garlandeth, And primroses that open to the moon. Listen, the music swells into a song, A simple song I loved in days of yore; The echoes take it up and up along The hills, and the wind blows it back again.— Peace, peace, there is a memory in that strain Of happy days that shall return no more. Oh peace, your music wakeneth old thought, But not old hope that made my life so sweet, Only the longing that must end in nought. Have patience with me, friends, a little while: For soon where you shall dance and sing and smile, My quickened dust may blossom at your feet. Sweet thought that I may yet live and grow green, That leaves may yet spring from the withered root, And buds and flowers and berries half unseen; Then if you haply muse upon the past, Say this: Poor child, she hath her wish at last; Barren through life, but in death bearing fruit. Life hidden. Roses and lilies grow above the place Where she sleeps the long sleep that doth not dream. If we could look upon her hidden face Nor shadow would be there nor garish gleam Of light: her life is lapsing like a stream That makes no noise but floweth on apace Seawards; while many a shade and shady beam Vary the ripples in their gliding chase. She doth not see, but knows: she doth not feel, And yet is sensible: she hears no sound, Yet counts the flight of time and doth not err. Peace far and near; peace to ourselves and her: Her body is at peace in holy ground, Her spirit is at peace where Angels kneel. Queen Rose. The jessamine shows like a star; The lilies sway like sceptres slim; Fair clematis from near and far Sets forth its wayward tangled whim; Curved meadowsweet blooms rich and dim;— But yet a rose is fairer far. The jessamine is odorous; so Maid lilies are, and clematis; And where tall meadowsweet flowers grow A rare and subtle perfume is;— What can there be more choice than these?— A rose when it doth bud and blow. Let others choose sweet jessamine, Or weave their lily crown aright, And let who love it pluck and twine Loose clematis; or draw delight From meadowsweet's clustry downy white;— The rose, the perfect rose be mine. How one chose. “Beyond the sea, in a green land Where only rivers are;— Beyond the clouds, in the clear sky Close by some quiet star;— Could you not fancy there might be A home Beloved for you and me?” “If there were such a home my Friend Truly prepared for us Full of palm branches or of crowns Sun-gemmed and glorious, How should we reach it? let us cease From longing; let us be at peace.” “The nightingale sang yestereve; A sweet song singeth she: Most sad and without any hope And full of memory; But still methought it seemed to speak To me of home, and bid me seek.” “The nightingale ceased ere the morn: Her heart could not contain The passion of her song, but burst With the loud throbbing pain. Now she hath rest which is the best, And now I too would be at rest.” “Last night I watched the mounting moon: Her glory was too pale To shine thro' the black heavy clouds That wrapped her like a veil; And yet with patience she passed thro' The mists and reached the depths of blue.” “And when the road was travelled o'er And when the goal was won A little while and all her light Was swallowed by the sun: The weary moon must seek again; Even so our search would be in vain.” “Yet seek with me. And if our way Be long and troublesome, And if our noon be hot until The chilly shadows come Of evening;—till those shadows flee In dawn, think Love it is with me.” “Nay seek alone: I am no mate For such as you, in truth: My heart is old before its time; Yours yet is in its youth: This home with pleasures girt about Seek you, for I am wearied out.” Seeking rest. My Mother said: The child is changed That used to be so still; All the day long she sings, and sings, And seems to think no ill; She laughs as if some inward joy Her heart would overfill. My Sisters said: Now prithee tell Thy secret unto us: Let us rejoice with thee; for all Is surely prosperous, Thou art so merry: tell us Sweet: We had not used thee thus. My Mother says: What ails the child Lately so blythe of cheer? Art sick or sorry? nay, it is The Winter of the year; Wait till the Spring time comes again And the sweet flowers appear. My Sisters say: Come, sit with us, That we may weep with thee: Show us thy grief that we may grieve: Yea, haply, if we see Thy sorrow, we may ease it; but Shall share it certainly. How should I share my pain, who kept My pleasure all my own? My Spring will never come again; My pretty flowers have blown For the last time; I can but sit And think and weep alone. A Year Afterwards. Things are so changed since last we met: Come; I will show you where she lies. Doubtless the old look fills her eyes, And the old patient smile is set Upon her mouth: it was even so When last I saw her stretched and still, So pale and calm I could not weep: The steady sweetness did not go Thro' the long week she lay asleep, Until the dust was heaped on her. Now many-feathered grasses grow Above her bosom: come; I will Show you all this, and we can talk Going; it is a pleasant walk And the wind makes it pleasanter. This is the very path that she So often trod with eager feet Tho' weary. The dusk branches meet Above, making green fretted work, The screen between my saint and me. There, where the softest sunbeams lurk, Cannot you fancy she may be Leaning down to me from her rest; And shaking her long golden hair Thro' the thick branches to my face, That I may feel she still is mine?— Is not this wood a pleasant place? To me the faintest breath of air Seems here to whisper tenderly That she, mine own, will not forget. It may be selfishness; and yet I like to think her joy may not Be perfected, although divine In all the glory of the blest, Without me: that the greenest spot And shadiest, would not suffice, Without me, even in Paradise. But we must leave the wood to go Across the sunny fields of wheat; I used to fancy that the grass And daisies loved to touch her feet. This was the way we used to pass Together; rain nor wind nor snow Could hinder her, until her strength Failed utterly; and when at length She was too weak, they put her bed Close to the window; there she lay Counting the Church chimes one by one For many weeks: at last a day Came when her patient watch was done, And some one told me she was dead. Now we can see the Church tower; look, Where the old flaky yew trees stand. There is a certain shady nook Among them, where she used to sit When weary: I have held her hand So often there: one day she said That sometimes, when we sat so, she Could fancy what being dead must be, And long for it if shared by me:— She had no cause for dreading it, And never once conceived my dread. This path leads to the Western door Where the sun casts his latest beam, And hard beside it is her grave. I sowed those grasses there that wave Like down, but would sow nothing more, No flowers, as if her resting place Could want for sweetness; where she is Is sweetest of all sweetnesses. If you look closely, you can trace A Cross formed by the grass, above Her head: and sometimes I could dream She sees the Cross, and feels the love That planted it; and prays that I May come and share her hidden rest; May even lie where she doth lie, With the same turf above my breast, And the same stars and silent sky. Two thoughts of Death. 1 Her heart that loved me once is rottenness Now and corruption; and her life is dead That was to have been one with mine she said. The earth must lie with such a cruel stress On her eyes where the white lids used to press; Foul worms fill up her mouth so sweet and red; Foul worms are underneath her graceful head. Yet these, being born of her from nothingness These worms are certainly flesh of her flesh.— How is it that the grass is rank and green, And the dew dropping rose is brave and fresh Above what was so sweeter far than they? Even as her beauty hath passed quite away Their's too shall be as tho' it had not been. 2 So I said underneath the dusky trees: But because I still loved her memory I stooped to pluck a pale anemone And lo! my hand lighted upon heartsease Not fully blown: while with new life from these Fluttered a starry moth that rapidly Rose toward the sun: sunlighted flashed on me Its wings that seemed to throb like heart pulses. Far far away it flew far out of sight, From earth and flowers of earth it passed away As tho' it flew straight up into the light. Then my heart answered me: Thou fool to say That she is dead whose night is turned to day, And whose day shall no more turn back to night. Three Moments. The Child said: “Pretty bird “Come back and play with me.” The bird said: “It is in vain, “For I am free. “I am free, I will not stay, “But will fly far away, “In the woods to sing and play, “Far away, far away.” The Child sought her Mother: “I have lost my bird;” said she Weeping bitterly: But the Mother made her answer, Half sighing pityingly, Half smiling cheerily: “Tho' thy bird come nevermore “Do not weep; “Find another playfellow “Child, and keep “Tears for future pain more deep.” “Sweet rose do not wither,” The Girl said. But a blight had touched its heart And it drooped its crimson head. In the morning it had opened Full of life and bloom, But the leaves fell one by one Till the twilight gloom. One by one the leaves fell By summer winds blown from their stem; They fell upon the dewy earth Which nourished once now tainted them. Again the young Girl wept And sought her Mother's ear: “My rose is dead so full of grace, “The very rose I meant to place “In the wreath that I wear.” “Nay, never weep for such as this;” The Mother answered her: “But weave another crown, less fair “Perhaps, but fitter for thy hair. “And keep thy tears,” the Mother said: “For something heavier.” The Woman knelt; but did not pray Nor weep nor cry; she only said: “Not this, not this:” and clasped her hands Against her heart and bowed her head While the great struggle shook the bed. “Not this, not this:” tears did not fall: “Not this:” it was all She could say; no sobs would come; The mortal grief was almost dumb.— At length when it was over, when She knew it was and would be so, She cried: “Oh Mother, where are they, “The tears that used to flow “So easily? one single drop “Might save my reason now, or stop “My heart from breaking. Blessed tears “Wasted in former years!” Then the grave Mother made reply: “Oh Daughter mine be of good cheer, “Rejoicing thou canst shed no tear. “Thy pain is almost over now. “Once more thy heart shall throb with pain, “But then shall never throb again. “Oh happy thou who canst not weep, “Oh happy thou!” Once. She was whiter than the ermine That half shadowed neck and hand, And her tresses were more golden Than their golden band; Snowy ostrich plumes she wore Yet I almost loved her more In the simple time before. Then she plucked the stately lilies Knowing not she was more fair, And she listened to the skylark In the morning air. Then, a kerchief all her crown, She looked for the acorns brown, Bent their bough and shook them down. Then she thought of Christmas holly And of maybloom in sweet May; Then she loved to pick the cherries And to turn the hay. She was humble then and meek, And the blush upon her cheek Told of much she could not speak. Now she is a noble lady, With calm voice not overloud; Very courteous in her action, Yet you think her proud; Much too haughty to affect; Too indifferent to direct, Or be angry, or suspect; Doing all from self-respect. Three Nuns. 1. “Sospira questo core E non so dir perchè.” Shadow, shadow on the wall Spread thy shelter over me; Wrap me with a heavy pall, With the dark that none may see. Fold thyself around me; come: Shut out all the troublesome Noise of life; I would be dumb. Shadow thou hast reached my feet, Rise and cover up my head; Be my stainless winding sheet, Buried before I am dead. Lay thy cool upon my breast: Once I thought that joy was best, Now I only care for rest. By the grating of my cell Sings a solitary bird; Sweeter than the vesper bell, Sweetest song was ever heard. “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” E. B. Browning. Sing upon thy living tree: Happy echoes answer thee, Happy songster, sing to me. When my yellow hair was curled Though men saw and called me fair, I was weary in the world Full of vanity and care. Gold was left behind, curls shorn When I came here; that same morn Made a bride no gems adorn. Here wrapped in my spotless veil, Curtained from intruding eyes, I whom prayers and fasts turn pale Wait the flush of Paradise. But the vigil is so long My heart sickens:—sing thy song, Blithe bird that canst do no wrong. Sing on, making me forget Present sorrow and past sin. Sing a little longer yet: Soon the matins will begin; And I must turn back again To that aching worse than pain I must bear and not complain. Sing, that in thy song I may Dream myself once more a child In the green woods far away Plucking clematis and wild Hyacinths, till pleasure grew Tired, yet so was pleasure too, Resting with no work to do. In the thickest of the wood, I remember, long ago How a stately oak tree stood, With a sluggish pool below Almost shadowed out of sight. On the waters dark as night, Water-lilies lay like light. There, while yet a child, I thought I could live as in a dream, Secret, neither found nor sought: Till the lilies on the stream, Pure as virgin purity, Would seem scarce too pure for me:— Ah, but that can never be. 2. “Sospirerà d'amore, Ma non lo dice a me.” I loved him, yes, where was the sin? I loved him with my heart and soul. But I pressed forward to no goal, There was no prize I strove to win. Show me my sin that I may see:— Throw the first stone, thou Pharisee. I loved him, but I never sought That he should know that I was fair. I prayed for him; was my sin prayer? I sacrificed, he never bought. He nothing gave, he nothing took; We never bartered look for look. My voice rose in the sacred choir, The choir of Nuns; do you condemn Even if, when kneeling among them, Faith, zeal and love kindled a fire And I prayed for his happiness Who knew not? was my error this? I only prayed that in the end His trust and hope may not be vain. I prayed not we may meet again: I would not let our names ascend, No, not to Heaven, in the same breath; Nor will I join the two in death. Oh sweet is death; for I am weak And weary, and it giveth rest. The Crucifix lies on my breast, And all night long it seems to speak Of rest; I hear it through my sleep, And the great comfort makes me weep. Oh sweet is death that bindeth up The broken and the bleeding heart. The draught chilled, but a cordial part Lurked at the bottom of the cup; And for my patience will my Lord Give an exceeding great reward. Yea, the reward is almost won, A crown of glory and a palm. Soon I shall sing the unknown psalm; Soon gaze on light, not on the sun; And soon, with surer faith, shall pray For him, and cease not night nor day. My life is breaking like a cloud; God judgeth not as man doth judge.— Nay, bear with me; you need not grudge This peace; the vows that I have vowed Have all been kept: Eternal Strength Holds me, though mine own fails at length. Bury me in the Convent ground Among the flowers that are so sweet; And lay a green turf at my feet, Where thick trees cast a gloom around. At my head let a Cross be, white Through the long blackness of the night. Now kneel and pray beside my bed That I may sleep being free from pain: And pray that I may wake again After His Likeness, Who hath said (Faithful is He Who promiseth,) We shall be satisfied Therewith. 3. “Rispondimi, cor mio, Perchè sospiri tu? Risponde: Voglio Iddio, Sospiro per Gesù.” My heart is as a freeborn bird Caged in my cruel breast, That flutters, flutters evermore, Nor sings, nor is at rest. But beats against the prison bars, As knowing its own nest Far off beyond the clouded West. My soul is as a hidden fount Shut in by clammy clay, That struggles with an upward moan; Striving to force its way Up through the turf, over the grass, Up, up into the day, Where twilight no more turneth grey. Oh for the grapes of the True Vine Growing in Paradise, Whose tendrils join the Tree of Life To that which maketh wise. Growing beside the Living Well Whose sweetest waters rise Where tears are wiped from tearful eyes. Oh for the waters of that Well Round which the Angels stand. Oh for the Shadow of the Rock On my heart's weary land. Oh for the Voice to guide me when I turn to either hand, Guiding me till I reach Heaven's strand. Thou World from which I am come out, Keep all thy gems and gold; Keep thy delights and precious things, Thou that art waxing old. My heart shall beat with a new life, When thine is dead and cold: When thou dost fear I shall be bold. When Earth shall pass away with all Her pride and pomp of sin, The City builded without hands Shall safely shut me in. All the rest is but vanity Which others strive to win: Where their hopes end my joys begin. I will not look upon a rose Though it is fair to see: The flowers planted in Paradise Are budding now for me. Red roses like love visible Are blowing on their tree, Or white like virgin purity. I will not look unto the sun Which setteth night by night: In the untrodden courts of Heaven My crown shall be more bright. Lo, in the New Jerusalem Founded and built aright My very feet shall tread on light. With foolish riches of this World I have bought treasure, where Nought perisheth: for this white veil I gave my golden hair; I gave the beauty of my face For vigils, fasts and prayer; I gave all for this Cross I bear. My heart trembled when first I took The vows which must be kept; At first it was a weariness To watch when once I slept. The path was rough and sharp with thorns; My feet bled as I stepped; The Cross was heavy and I wept. While still the names rang in mine ears Of daughter, sister, wife; The outside world still looked so fair To my weak eyes, and rife With beauty; my heart almost failed; Then in the desperate strife I prayed, as one who prays for life, Until I grew to love what once Had been so burdensome. So now when I am faint, because Hope deferred seems to numb My heart, I yet can plead; and say Although my lips are dumb: “The Spirit and the Bride say, Come.” Song. [We buried her among the flowers] We buried her among the flowers At falling of the leaf, And choked back all our tears; her joy Could never be our grief. She lies among the living flowers And grass, the only thing That perishes;—or is it that Our Autumn was her Spring? Doubtless, if we could see her face, The smile is settled there Which almost broke our hearts, when last We knelt by her in prayer. When with tired eyes and failing breath And hands crossed on her breast Perhaps she saw her Guardian spread His wings above her rest. So she sleeps hidden in the flowers: But yet a little while And we shall see her wake, and rise Fair, with the selfsame smile. The Watchers. She fell asleep among the flowers In the sober Autumn hours. Three there are about her bed, At her side and feet and head. At her head standeth the Cross For which all else she counted loss: Still and steadfast at her feet Doth her Guardian Angel sit: Prayers of truest love abide Wrapping her on every side. The Holy Cross standeth alone, Beneath the white moon, whitest stone. Evil spirits come not near Its shadow, shielding from all fear; Once she bore it in her breast, Now it certifies her rest. Humble violets grow around Its base, sweetening the grassy ground, Leaf-hidden; so she hid from praise Of men her pious holy ways. Higher about it, twining close, Clingeth a crimson thorny rose; So from her heart's good seed of love Thorns sprang below, flowers spring above. Tho' yet his vigil doth not cease, Her Angel sits in perfect peace, With white folded wings; for she He watches, now is pure as he. He watches with his loving eyes For the day when she shall rise; When full of glory and of grace She shall behold him face to face. Tho' she is safe for ever, yet Human love doth not forget; But prays that in her deep Grave she may sleep a blessed sleep, Till when time and the world are past She may find mercy at the last. So these three do hedge her in From sorrow as death does from sin. So freed from earthly taint and pain May they all meet in Heaven. Amen. Annie. Annie is fairer than her kith And kinder than her kin; Her eyes are like the open heaven Holy and pure from sin; Her heart is like an ordered house Good fairies harbour in; Oh happy he who wins the love That I can never win. Her sisters stand as hyacinths Around the perfect rose: They bloom and open to the full, My bud will scarce unclose; They are for every butterfly That comes and sips and goes, My bud hides in the tender green Most sweet and hardly shows. Oh cruel kindness in soft eyes That are no more than kind, On which I gaze my heart away Till the tears make me blind. How is it others find the way That I can never find To make her laugh that sweetest laugh Which leaves all else behind? Her hair is like the golden corn A low wind breathes upon; Or like the golden harvest moon When all the mists are gone; Or like a stream with golden sands On which the sun has shone Day after day in summer time Ere autumn leaves are wan. I will not tell her that I love Lest she should turn away With sorrow in her tender heart Which now is light and gay. I will not tell her that I love Lest she should turn and say That we must meet no more again For many a weary day. A Dirge. She was as sweet as violets in the Spring, As fair as any rose in Summer time: But frail are roses in their prime And violets in their blossoming. Even so was she: And now she lies, The earth upon her fast closed eyes, Dead in the darkness silently. The sweet Spring violets never bud again, The roses bloom and perish in a morn: They see no second quickening lying lorn; Their beauty dies as tho' in vain. Must she die so For evermore, Cold as the sand upon the shore, As passionless for joy and woe?— Nay, she is worth much more than flowers that fade And yet shall be made fair with purple fruit; Branch of the Living Vine, Whose Root From all eternity is laid. Another Sun Than this of our's, Has withered up indeed her flowers But ripened her grapes every one. Song. [It is not for her even brow] It is not for her even brow And shining yellow hair, But it is for her tender eyes I think my love so fair; Her telltale eyes that smile and weep As frankly as they wake and sleep. It is not for her rounded cheek I love and fain would win, But it is for the blush that comes Straight from the heart within; The honest blush of maiden shame That blushes without thought of blame. So in my dreams I never hear Her song, although she sings As if a choir of spirits swept From earth with throbbing wings; I only hear the simple voice Whose love makes many hearts rejoice. A Dream. Oh for my love, my only love, Oh for my lost love far away!— Oh that the grass were green above Her head or mine this weary day:— The grass green in the morning grey. She lies down in a foreign land And in a foreign land doth rise. I cannot hold her by the hand; I cannot read her speaking eyes That turned mere spoken words to lies. This is the bough she leaned upon And watched the rose deep western sky, For the last sun rays almost gone: I did not hear the wind pass by, Nor stream; I only heard her sigh. I saw the tears that did not fall, I saw the blush upon her cheek, The trembling hand so white and small: She did not speak, I could not speak:— Oh that strong love should make us weak. Therefore we parted as we met, She on her way, and I on mine. I think her tender heart was set On holier things and more Divine:— We parted thus and gave no sign. Oh that the grass were green above Her head or mine; so I could pray In certain faith for her my love, Unchanging, all the night and day: Most near altho' most far away. “A fair World tho' a fallen.”— You tell me that the world is fair, in spite Of the old fall; and that I should not turn So to the grave, and let my spirit yearn After the quiet of the long last night. Have I then shut mine eyes against the light, Grief-deafened lest my spirit should discern? Yet how could I keep silence when I burn? And who can give me comfort?—hear the right. Have patience with the weak and sick at heart: Bind up the wounded with a tender touch. Comfort the sad, tear-blinded as they go:— For tho' I failed to choose the better part, Were it a less unutterable woe If we should come to love this world too much?— Advent. “Come,” thou dost say to Angels, To blessed Spirits, “Come”; “Come,” to the Lambs of Thine Own flock, Thy little Ones, “Come home.” “Come,” from the many-mansioned house The gracious word is sent, “Come,” from the ivory palaces Unto the Penitent. O Lord, restore us deaf and blind, Unclose our lips tho' dumb; Then say to us, “I come with speed,” And we will answer, “Come.” All Saints. They have brought gold and spices to my King, Incense and precious stuffs and ivory; O holy Mother mine, what can I bring That so my Lord may deign to look on me? They sing a sweeter song than I can sing, All crowned and glorified exceedingly; I, bound on earth, weep for my trespassing, They sing the song of love in Heaven, set free. Then answered me my Mother, and her voice, Spake to my heart, yea, answered in my heart: Sing, saith He, to the Heavens, to Earth, rejoice; Thou, also, lift thy heart to Him above; He seeks not thine, but thee, such as thou art, For lo! His banner over thee is Love. “Eye hath not seen.” Our feet shall tread upon the stars Less bright than we. The everlasting shore shall bound A fairer sea Than that which cold Now glitters in the sun like gold. Oh good, oh blest: but who shall say How fair, how fair, Is the Light-region where no cloud Darkens the air, Where weary eyes Rest on the green of Paradise? There cometh not the wind, nor rain, Nor sun, nor snow; The trees of Knowledge and of Life Bud there and blow, Their leaves and fruit Fed from an undecaying root. There Angels flying to and fro Are not more white Than Penitents some while ago, Now Saints in Light: Once soiled and sad; Cleansed now and crowned, fulfilled and glad. Now yearning thro' the perfect rest Perhaps they gaze Earthwards upon their best beloved In all earth's ways: Longing, but not With pain, as used to be their lot. The hush of that beatitude Is ages long, Sufficing Virgins, Prophets, Saints, Till the new song Shall be sent up From lips which drained the bitter cup. If but the thought of Paradise Gives joy on earth, What shall it be to enter there Thro' second birth? To find once more Our dearest treasure gone before? To find the Shepherd of the Sheep, The Lamb once slain, Who leads His Own by living streams. Never again To thirst, or need Aught in green pastures where they feed. But from the Altar comes a cry Awful and strong From martyred Saints: How long, they say, O Lord, how long Holy and True, Shall vengeance for our blood be due? Then the Lord gives them robes of white; And bids them stay In patience till the time be full For the last day: The day of dread When the last sentence shall be said. When heaven and earth shall flee away; And the great deep Shall render up her dead, and earth Her sons that sleep; And day of grace Be hid for ever from Thy Face. Oh hide us till Thy wrath be past, Our grief, our shame, With Peter and with Magdalene And him whose name No record tells Who by Thy promise with Thee dwells. St. Elizabeth of Hungary. When if ever life is sweet, Save in heart in all a child, A fair virgin undefiled Knelt she at her Saviour's feet; While she laid her royal crown, Thinking it too mean a thing For a solemn offering, Careless on the cushions down. Fair she was as any rose, But more pale than lilies white, Her eyes full of deep repose Seemed to see beyond our sight. Hush, she is a holy thing: Hush, her soul is in her eyes Seeking far in Paradise For her Light, her Love, her King. Moonshine. Fair the sun riseth, Bright as bright can be, Fair the sun shineth On a fair fair sea. “Across the water “Wilt thou come with me, “Miles and long miles, love, “Over the salt sea?”— “If thou wilt hold me “Truly by the hand, “I will go with thee “Over sea and sand. “If thou wilt hold me “That I shall not fall, “I will go with thee, “Love, in spite of all.” Fair the moon riseth On her heavenly way Making the waters Fairer than by day. A little vessel Rocks upon the sea, Where stands a maiden Fair as fair can be. Her smile rejoices Though her mouth is mute, She treads the vessel With her little foot. Truly he holds her Faithful to his pledge, Guiding the vessel From the water's edge. Fair the moon saileth With her pale fair light, Fair the girl gazeth Out into the night. Saith she: “Like silver “Shines thy hair, not gold;”— Saith she: “I shiver “In thy steady hold. “Love,” she saith weeping, “Loose thy hold awhile, “My heart is freezing “In thy freezing smile.” The moon is hidden By a silver cloud, Fair as a halo Or a maiden's shroud. No more beseeching, Ever on they go: The vessel rocketh Softly to and fro; And still he holds her That she shall not fall, Till pale mists whiten Dimly over all. Onward and onward, Far across the sea; Onward and onward, Pale as pale can be; Onward and onward, Ever hand in hand, From sun and moon light To another land. “The Summer is ended.” Wreathe no more lilies in my hair, For I am dying, Sister sweet: Or if you will for the last time Indeed, why make me fair Once for my windingsheet. Pluck no more roses for my breast, For I like them fade in my prime: Or if you will, why pluck them still That they may share my rest Once more, for the last time. Weep not for me when I am gone, Dear tender one, but hope and smile: Or if you cannot choose but weep A little while, weep on Only a little while. “I look for the Lord.” Our wealth has wasted all away, Our pleasures have found wings; The night is long until the day, Lord, give us better things: A ray of light in thirsty night And secret water springs. Our love is dead, or sleeps, or else Is hidden from our eyes: Our silent love, while no man tells Or if it lives or dies. Oh give us love, O Lord, above In changeless Paradise. Our house is left us desolate, Even as Thy word hath said. Before our face the way is great, Around us are the dead: Oh guide us, save us from the grave, As Thou Thy saints hast led. Lead us where pleasures evermore And wealth indeed are placed, And home on an eternal shore, And love that cannot waste; Where Joy Thou art unto the heart, And Sweetness to the taste. Song. [I have loved you for long long years Ellen] I have loved you for long long years Ellen, On you has my heart been set; I have loved you for long patient years, But you do not love me yet. Oh that the sun that rose that day Had never and never set, When I wooed and you did not turn away, Tho' you could not love me yet. I lay lands and gold at your feet Ellen, At your feet a coronet, I lay a true heart at your feet Ellen, But you do not love me yet. Oh when I too lie dead at your feet, And in death my heart is set, Will you love me then, cold proud Ellen, Tho' you will not love me yet?— A Discovery. “I thought your search was over.”—“So I thought.”— “But you are seeking still.”—“Yes, even so: Still seeking in mine own despite below That which in Heaven alone is found unsought; Still spending for that thing which is not bought.”— “Then chase no more this shifting empty show.”— “Amen: so bid a drowning man forego The straw he clutches; will he so be taught? You have a home where peace broods like a dove Screened from the weary world's loud discontent, You have home here, you wait for home above: I must unlearn the pleasant ways I went, Must learn another hope, another love, And sigh indeed for home in banishment.”— From the Antique. The wind shall lull us yet, The flowers shall spring above us; And those who hate forget, And those forget who love us. The pulse of hope shall cease, Of joy and of regretting: We twain shall sleep in peace, Forgotten and forgetting. For us no sun shall rise, Nor wind rejoice, nor river, Where we with fast closed eyes Shall sleep and sleep for ever. “The heart knoweth its own bitterness.” Weep yet a while Weep till that day shall dawn when thou shalt smile Watch till the day When all save only Love shall pass away. Weep, sick and lonely, Bow thy heart to tears, For none shall guess the secret Of thy griefs and fears. Weep, till the day dawn, Refreshing dew: Weep till the spring; For genial showers Bring up the flowers, And thou shalt sing In summer time of blossoming. Heart sick and silent, Weep and watch in pain. Weep for hope perished, Not to live again; Weep for love's hope and fear And passion vain. Watch till the day When all save only love shall pass away. Then love rejoicing Shall forget to weep; Shall hope or fear no more, Or watch, or sleep, But only love and cease not, Deep beyond deep. Now we sow love in tears, But then shall reap: Have patience as the Lord's Own flock of sheep: Have patience with His Love, Who died below, Who lives for thee above. “To what purpose is this waste?” A windy shell singing upon the shore: A lily budding in a desert place; Blooming alone With no companion To praise its perfect perfume and its grace: A rose crimson and blushing at the core, Hedged in with thorns behind it and before: A fountain in the grass, Whose shadowy waters pass Only to nourish birds and furnish food For squirrels of the wood: An oak deep in the forest's heart, the house Of black-eyed tiny mouse; Its strong roots fit for fuel roofing in The hoarded nuts, acorns and grains of wheat; Shutting them from the wind and scorching heat, And sheltering them when the rains begin: A precious pearl deep buried in the sea Where none save fishes be: The fullest merriest note for which the skylark strains his silver throat, Heard only in the sky By other birds that fitfully Chase one another as they fly: The ripest plum down tumbled to the ground By southern winds most musical of sound, But by no thirsty traveller found: Honey of wild bees in their ordered cells Stored, not for human mouths to taste:— I said, smiling superior down: What waste Of good, where no man dwells. This I said on a pleasant day in June Before the sun had set, tho' a white moon Already flaked the quiet blue Which not a star looked thro.’ But still the air was warm, and drowsily It blew into my face: So since that same day I had wandered deep Into the country, I sought out a place For rest beneath a tree, And very soon forgot myself in sleep: Not so mine own words had forgotten me. Mine eyes were opened to behold All hidden things, And mine ears heard all secret whisperings: So my proud tongue that had been bold To carp and to reprove, Was silenced by the force of utter Love. All voices of all things inanimate Join with the song of Angels and the song Of blessed Spirits, chiming with Their Hallelujahs. One wind wakeneth Across the sleeping sea, crisping along The waves, and brushes thro' the great Forests and tangled hedges, and calls out Of rivers a clear sound, And makes the ripe corn rustle on the ground, And murmurs in a shell; Till all their voices swell Above the clouds in one loud hymn Joining the song of Seraphim, Or like pure incense circle round about The walls of Heaven, or like a well-spring rise In shady Paradise. A lily blossoming unseen Holds honey in its silver cup Whereon a bee may sup, Till being full she takes the rest And stores it in her waxen nest: While the fair blossom lifted up On its one stately stem of green Is type of her, the Undefiled, Arrayed in white, whose eyes are mild As a white dove's, whose garment is Blood-cleansed from all impurities And earthly taints, Her robe the righteousness of Saints. And other eyes than our's Were made to look on flowers, Eyes of small birds and insects small: The deep sun-blushing rose Round which the prickles close Opens her bosom to them all. The tiniest living thing That soars on feathered wing, Or crawls among the long grass out of sight, Has just as good a right To its appointed portion of delight As any King. Why should we grudge a hidden water stream To birds and squirrels while we have enough? As if a nightingale should cease to sing Lest we should hear, or finch leafed out of sight Warbling its fill in summer light; As if sweet violets in the spring Should cease to blow, for fear our path should seem Less weary or less rough. So every oak that stands a house For skilful mouse, And year by year renews its strength, Shakes acorns from a hundred boughs Which shall be oaks at length. Who hath weighed the waters and shall say What is hidden in the depths from day? Pearls and precious stones and golden sands, Wondrous weeds and blossoms rare, Kept back from human hands, But good and fair, A silent praise as pain is silent prayer. A hymn, an incense rising toward the skies, As our whole life should rise; An offering without stint from earth below, Which Love accepteth so. Thus is it with a warbling bird, With fruit bloom-ripe and full of seed, With honey which the wild bees draw From flowers, and store for future need By a perpetual law. We want the faith that hath not seen Indeed, but hath believed His truth Who witnessed that His work was good: So we pass cold to age from youth. Alas for us: for we have heard And known, but have not understood. O earth, earth, earth, thou yet shalt bow Who art so fair and lifted up, Thou yet shalt drain the bitter cup. Men's eyes that wait upon thee now, All eyes shall see thee lost and mean, Exposed and valued at thy worth, While thou shalt stand ashamed and dumb.— Ah, when the Son of Man shall come, Shall He find faith upon the earth?— Next of Kin. The shadows gather round me, while you are in the sun; My day is almost ended, but yours is just begun: The winds are singing to us both and the streams are singing still, And they fill your heart with music, but mine they cannot fill. Your home is built in sunlight, mine in another day; Your home is close at hand, sweet friend, but mine is far away: Your bark is in the haven where you fain would be; I must launch out into the deep, across the unknown sea. You, white as dove or lily or spirit of the light; I, stained and cold and glad to hide in the cold dark night: You, joy to many a loving heart and light to many eyes; I, lonely in the knowledge earth is full of vanities. Yet when your day is over, as mine is nearly done, And when your race is finished, as mine is almost run, You, like me, shall cross your hands and bow your graceful head; Yea, we twain shall sleep together in an equal bed. “Let them rejoice in their beds.” The winds sing to us where we lie, They sing to us a pleasant song; Sweeter than song of mortal mouth, Spice laden from the sunny south. They say: This is not death you die; This slumber shall not hold you long. The north winds stir around our rest, Their whispers speak to us and say: Sleep yet awhile secure and deep, A little while the blessed sleep; For your inheritance is best, And night shall yet bring forth the day. The western winds are whispering too Of love, with faith and hope as yet, Of consummation that shall be, Of fulness as the unfathomed sea, When all creation shall be new And day arise that shall not set. But from the east a word is sent To which all other words are dumb: Lo, I come quickly, saith the Lord, Myself thy exceeding great Reward:— While we with thirsty hearts intent Answer: Yea, come, Lord Jesus, come. Portraits. An easy lazy length of limb, Dark eyes and features from the south, A short-legged meditative pipe Set in a supercilious mouth; Ink and a pen and papers laid Down on a table for the night, Beside a semi-dozing man Who wakes to go to bed by light. A pair of brothers brotherly, Unlike and yet how much the same In heart and high-toned intellect, In face and bearing, hope and aim: Friends of the selfsame treasured friends And of one home the dear delight, Beloved of many a loving heart And cherished both in mine, good night. Whitsun Eve. The white dove cooeth in her downy nest, Keeping her young ones warm beneath her breast: The white moon saileth thro' the cool clear sky, Screened by a tender mist in passing by: The white rose buds, with thorns upon its stem, All the more precious and more dear for them: The stream shines silver in the tufted grass, The white clouds scarcely dim it as they pass: Deep in the valleys lily cups are white, They send up incense all the holy night: Our souls are white, made clean in Blood once shed: White blessed Angels watch around our bed:— O spotless Lamb of God, still keep us so, Thou Who wert born for us in time of snow. What? Strengthening as secret manna, Fostering as clouds above, Kind as a hovering dove, Full as a plenteous river, Our glory and our banner For ever and for ever. Dear as a dying cadence Of music in the drowsy night; Fair as the flowers which maidens Pluck for an hour's delight, And then forget them quite. Gay as a cowslip meadow Fresh opening to the sun When new day is begun; Soft as a sunny shadow When day is almost done. Glorious as purple twilight, Pleasant as budding tree, Untouched as any islet Shrined in an unknown sea; Sweet as a fragrant rose amid the dew;— As sweet, as fruitless too. A bitter dream to wake from, But oh how pleasant while we dream; A poisoned fount to take from, But oh how sweet the stream. A Pause. They made the chamber sweet with flowers and leaves, And the bed sweet with flowers on which I lay; While my soul, love-bound, loitered on its way. I did not hear the birds about the eaves, Nor hear the reapers talk among the sheaves: Only my soul kept watch from day to day, My thirsty soul kept watch for one away:— Perhaps he loves, I thought, remembers, grieves. At length there came the step upon the stair, Upon the lock the old familiar hand: Then first my spirit seemed to scent the air Of Paradise; then first the tardy sand Of time ran golden; and I felt my hair Put on a glory, and my soul expand. Holy Innocents. Sleep, little Baby, sleep, The holy Angels love thee, And guard thy bed and keep A blessed watch above thee. No spirit can come near Nor evil beast to harm thee; Sleep, Sweet, devoid of fear Where nothing need alarm thee. The Love Which doth not sleep, The eternal Arms surround thee; The Shepherd of the sheep In perfect love hath found thee. Sleep thro' the holy night Christ-kept from snare and sorrow Until thou wake to light And love and warmth tomorrow. “There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God.” 1. “Ye have forgotten the exhortation”— Come blessed sleep, most full, most perfect, come; Come sleep, if so I may forget the whole; Forget my body and forget my soul, Forget how long life is and troublesome. Come happy sleep to soothe my heart or numb, Arrest my weary spirit or control; Till light be dark to me from pole to pole, And winds and echoes and low songs be dumb. Come sleep and lap me into perfect calm, Lap me from all the world and weariness: Come secret sleep that hidest us from harm, Safe sheltered in a hidden cool recess: Come heavy dreamless sleep, and close and press Upon mine eyes thy fingers dropping balm. 2. “Which speaketh unto you as unto children.” Art thou so weary then, poor thirsty soul? Have patience, in due season thou shalt sleep. Mount yet a little while, the path is steep; Strain yet a little while to reach the goal; Do battle with thyself, achieve, control: Till night come down with blessed slumber, deep As love, and seal thine eyes no more to weep Thro' long tired vigils while the planets roll. Have patience, for thou too shalt sleep at length, Lapped in the pleasant shade of Paradise. My Hands That bled for thee shall close thine eyes, My Heart That bled for thee shall be thy Rest: I will sustain with everlasting Strength, And thou, with John, shalt lie upon my Breast. Annie. It's not for earthly bread, Annie, And it's not for earthly wine, And it's not for all thou art, Annie, Nor for any gift of thine: It's for other food and other love And other gifts I pine. I long all night and day, Annie, In this glorious month of June, Tho' the roses all are blossoming And the birds are all in tune: I dream and long all night, Annie, Beneath the tender moon. There is a dearer home than this In a land that's far away, And a better crown than cankered gold, Or withering leaves of bay: There's a richer love than thine, Annie, Must fill an endless day. I long to be alone indeed, I long to sleep at last; To know the lifelong fever And sick weariness are past; To feel the night is come indeed, And the gate secure and fast. Oh gate of death, of the blessed night, That shall open not again On this world of shame and sorrow, Where slow ages wax and wane, Where are signs and seasons, days and nights, And mighty winds and rain. I long to dwell in silence, In twilight cool and dim: It may be sometimes seeing Soft gleams of Seraphim; It may be sometimes catching Faint echoes of their hymn. I am tired of all the shows And of all the songs of earth; I am sick of the cold sky overhead, And the cold land of my birth; I am sick for the home-land of delight And love and endless worth. Is the day wearing toward the west?— Far off cool shadows pass, A visible refreshment Across the sultry grass; Far off low mists are mustering, A broken shifting mass. I know there comes a struggle Before the utter calm, And a searching pain like fire Before the healing balm;— But the pain shall cease, and the struggle cease, And we shall take no harm. Doubtless the Angels wonder That we can live at ease While all around is full of change, Yea, full of vanities: They wonder we can think to fill Our hearts with such as these. Still in the deepest knowledge Some depth is left unknown; Still in the merriest music lurks A plaintive undertone; Still with the closest friend some throb Of life is felt alone. But vain it were to linger On the race we have to run, For that which was must be again Till time itself is done; Yea, there is nothing new we know At all beneath the sun. I am sick for love, and moan Like a solitary dove: Love is as deep as hell, Annie, And as high as heaven above; There's nothing in all the world, Annie, That can compete with love. Time's summer breath is sweet, his sands Ebb sparkling as they flow, Yet some are sick that this should end Which is from long ago:— Are not the fields already white To harvest in the glow?— God puts the sickle to the corn And reaps it when He will From every watered valley And from every fruitful hill: He holdeth time in His Right Hand, To check or to fulfil. There shall come another harvest Than was in days of yore: The reapers shall be Angels, Our God shall purge the floor:— No more seed-time, no more harvest, Then for evermore. Come, let us kneel together Once again love, I and thou; We have prayed apart and wept apart, But may weep together now: Once we looked back together With our hands upon the plough. A little while, and we must part Again, as on that day: My spirit shall go forth alone To tread the untried way; Then thou shalt watch alone once more, And kneel alone to pray. When the shadows thicken round me And the silence grows apace, And I cannot hear thy voice, Annie, Nor look upon thy face, Wilt thou kneel for me and plead for me Before the Throne of Grace?— So surely if my spirit Hath knowledge while it lies In the outer courts of Heaven, It shall watch with longing eyes And pray that thou mayest also come To dwell in Paradise. Seasons. In spring time when the leaves are young, Clear dewdrops gleam like jewels, hung On boughs the fair birds roost among. When summer comes with sweet unrest, Birds weary of their mother's breast, And look abroad and leave the nest. In autumn ere the waters freeze, The swallows fly across the seas:— If we could fly away with these!— In winter when the birds are gone, The sun himself looks starved and wan, And starved the snow he shines upon. [Thou sleepest where the lilies fade] Thou sleepest where the lilies fade, Thou dwellest where the lilies fade not; Sweet, when thine earthly part decayed Thy heavenly part decayed not. Thou dwellest where the roses blow, The crimson roses bud and blossom; While on thine eyes is heaped the snow, The snow upon thy bosom. [I wish I were a little bird] I wish I were a little bird That out of sight doth soar, I wish I were a song once heard But often pondered o'er, Or shadow of a lily stirred By wind upon the floor, Or echo of a loving word Worth all that went before, Or memory of a hope deferred That springs again no more. (Two parted.) “Sing of a love lost and forgotten, “Sing of a joy finished and o'er, “Sing of a heart core-cold and rotten, “Sing of a hope springing no more.”— —“Sigh for a heart aching and sore.”— “I was most true and my own love betrayed me, “I was most true and she would none of me. “Was it the cry of the world that dismayed thee? “Love, I had bearded the wide world for thee.” —“Hark to the sorrowful sound of the sea.”— “Still in my dreams she comes tender and gracious, “Still in my dreams love looks out of her eyes: “Oh that the love of a dream were veracious, “Or that thus dreaming I might not arise!” “Oh for the silence that stilleth all sighs.”— [All night I dream you love me well] All night I dream you love me well, All day I dream that you are cold: Which is the dream? ah, who can tell, Ah would that it were told. So I should know my certain doom, Know all the gladness or the pain; So pass into the dreamless tomb, Or never doubt again. (For Rosaline's Album.) Do you hear the low winds singing, And streams singing on their bed?— Very distant bells are ringing In a chapel for the dead:— Death-pale better than life-red. Mother, come to me in rest, And bring little May to see.— Shall I bid no other guest?— Seven slow nights have passed away Over my forgotten clay: None must come save you and she. [Care flieth] Care flieth, Hope and fear together, Love dieth In the Autumn weather. For a friend Even care is pleasant; When fear doth end Hope is no more present: Autumn silences the turtle dove;— In blank Autumn who could speak of love? (Epitaph.) [A slave yet wearing on my head a crown] A slave yet wearing on my head a crown, A captive from whose eyes no tears ran down, Bound with no chain, compelled to do no work, I fell a victim to the jealous Turk. The P. R. B. The P. R. B. is in its decadence:— for Woolner in Australia cooks his chops; And Hunt is yearning for the land of Cheops; D. G. Rossetti shuns the vulgar optic; While William M. Rossetti merely lops His B.s in English disesteemed as Coptic; Calm Stephens in the twilight smokes his pipe But long the dawning of his public day; And he at last, the champion, great Millais Attaining academic opulence Winds up his signature with A. R. A.:— So rivers merge in the perpetual sea, So luscious fruit must fall when over ripe, And so the consummated P. R. B. Seasons. Crocuses and snowdrops wither, Violets primroses together, Fading with the fading spring Before a fuller blossoming. O sweet summer pass not soon, Stay awhile the harvest moon; O sweetest summer do not go, For autumn's next and next the snow. When autumn comes the days are drear, It is the downfall of the year: We heed the wind and falling leaf More than the withered harvest sheaf. Dreary winter come at last, Come quickly, so be quickly past; Dusk and sluggish winter wane Till spring and sunlight dawn again. “Who have a form of godliness.” When I am sick and tired it is God's will; Also, God's will alone is sure and best:— So in my weariness I find my rest, And so in poverty I take my fill: Therefore I see my good in midst of ill, Therefore in loneliness I build my nest; And thro' hot noon pant toward the shady west, And hope in sickening disappointment still. So when the times of restitution come, The sweet times of refreshing come at last, My God shall fill my longings to the brim: Therefore I wait and look and long for Him; Not wearied tho' the work is wearisome, Nor fainting tho' the time be almost past. Ballad. [Soft white lamb in the daisy meadow] Soft white lamb in the daisy meadow, Come hither and play with me, For I am lonesome and I am tired Underneath the apple tree. There's your husband if you're lonesome, lady, And your bed if you want for rest, And your baby for a playfellow With a soft hand for your breast. Fair white dove in the sunshine, Perched on the ashen bough, Come and perch by me and coo to me While the buds are blowing now. I must keep my nestlings warm, lady, Underneath my downy breast; There's your baby to coo and crow to you While I brood upon my nest. Faint white rose come lie on my heart, Come lie there with your thorn; For I'll be dead at the vesper bell And buried the morrow morn. There's blood on your lily breast, lady, Like roses when they blow, And there's blood upon your little hand That should be white as snow; I will stay amid my fellows Where the lilies grow. But its oh my own own little babe That I had you here to kiss, And to comfort me in the strange next world Tho' I slighted you so in this. You shall kiss both cheek and chin, mother, And kiss me between the eyes, Or ever the moon is on her way And the pleasant stars arise; You shall kiss and kiss your fill, mother, In the nest of Paradise. A Study. (A Soul.) She stands as pale as Parian statues stand; Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay, And felt her strength above the Roman sway, And felt the aspic writhing in her hand. Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land, For dim beyond it looms the land of day; Her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand. She stands there like a beacon thro' the night, A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is; She stands alone, a wonder deathly white; She stands there patient, nerved with inner might, Indomitable in her feebleness, Her face and will athirst against the light. “There remaineth therefore a rest.” Very cool that bed must be Where our last sleep shall be slept: There for weary vigils kept, There for tears that we have wept, Is our guerdon certainly. Underneath the growing grass, Underneath the living flowers, Deeper than the sound of showers;— There we shall not count the hours By the shadows as they pass. No more struggling then at length, Only slumber everywhere; Nothing more to do or bear: We shall rest, and resting there Eagle-like renew our strength. In the grave will be no space For the purple of the proud, They must mingle with the crowd; In the wrappings of a shroud Jewels would be out of place. Youth and health will be but vain, Courage reckoned of no worth; There a very little girth Shall hold round what once the earth Seemed too narrow to contain. High and low and rich and poor, All will fare alike at last: The old promise standeth fast: None shall care then if the past Held more joys for him or fewer. There no laughter shall be heard, Nor the heavy sound of sighs; Sleep shall seal the aching eyes; All the ancient and the wise There shall utter not a word. Yet it may be we shall hear How the mounting skylark sings And the bell for matins rings; Or perhaps the whisperings Of white Angels sweet and clear. Sun or moon hath never shone In that hidden depth of night; But the souls there washed and white Are more fair than fairest light Mortal eye hath looked upon. The die cast whose throw is life— Rest complete; not one in seven— Souls love-perfected and shriven Waiting at the door of heaven, Perfected from fear of strife. What a calm when all is done, Wearing vigil, prayer and fast:— All fulfilled from first to last:— All the length of time gone past And eternity begun. Fear and hope and chastening rod Urge us on the narrow way: Bear we still as best we may Heat and burden of the day, Struggling panting up to God. “Ye have forgotten the exhortation.” Angel Bury thy dead, dear friend, Between the night and day; Where depths of summer shade are cool, And murmurs of a summer pool And windy murmurs stray:— Soul Ah, gone away, Ah, dear and lost delight, Gone from me and for ever out of sight. Angel Bury thy dead, dear love, And make his bed most fair above; The latest buds shall still Blow there, and the first violets too, And there a turtle dove Shall brood and coo:— Soul I cannot make the nest So warm, but he may find it chill In solitary rest. Angel Bury thy dead heart-deep; Take patience till the sun be set; There are no tears for him to weep, No doubts to haunt him yet: Take comfort, he will not forget:— Soul Then I will watch beside his sleep; Will watch alone, And make my moan Because the harvest is so long to reap. Angel The fields are white to harvest, look and see, Are white abundantly. The harvest moon shines full and clear, The harvest time is near, Be of good cheer:— Soul Ah, woe is me; I have no heart for harvest time, Grown sick with hope deferred from chime to chime. Angel But One can give thee heart, thy Lord and his, Can raise both thee and him To shine with Seraphim And pasture where the eternal fountain is. Can give thee of that tree Whose leaves are health for thee; Can give thee robes made clean and white, And love, and all delight, And beauty where the day turns not to night. Who knocketh at His door And presseth in, goes out no more. Kneel as thou hast not knelt before— The time is short—and smite Upon thy breast and pray with all thy might:— Soul O Lord, my heart is broken for my sin: Yet hasten Thine Own day And come away. Is not time full? Oh put the sickle in, O Lord, begin. Guesses. Was it a chance that made her pause One moment at the opened door, Pale where she stood so flushed before As one a spirit overawes:— Or might it rather be because She felt the grave was at our feet, And felt that we should no more meet Upon its hither side no more? Was it a chance that made her turn Once toward the window passing by, One moment with a shrinking eye Wherein her spirit seemed to yearn:— Or did her soul then first discern How long and rough the pathway is That leads us home from vanities, And how it will be good to die? There was a hill she had to pass; And while I watched her up the hill She stooped one moment hurrying still, But left a rose upon the grass: Was it mere idleness:—or was Herself with her own self at strife Till while she chose the better life She felt this life has power to kill? Perhaps she did it carelessly, Perhaps it was an idle thought; Or else it was the grace unbought, A pledge to all eternity: I know not yet how this may be; But I shall know when face to face In Paradise we find a place And love with love that endeth not. From the Antique. It's a weary life, it is; she said:— Doubly blank in a woman's lot: I wish and I wish I were a man; Or, better than any being, were not: Were nothing at all in all the world, Not a body and not a soul; Not so much as a grain of dust Or drop of water from pole to pole. Still the world would wag on the same, Still the seasons go and come; Blossoms bloom as in days of old, Cherries ripen and wild bees hum. None would miss me in all the world, How much less would care or weep: I should be nothing; while all the rest Would wake and weary and fall asleep. Three Stages. 1. I looked for that which is not, nor can be, And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth; But years must pass before a hope of youth Is resigned utterly. I watched and waited with a steadfast will: And though the object seemed to flee away That I so longed for; ever, day by day, I watched and waited still. Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more: My expectation wearies and shall cease; I will resign it now and be at peace:— Yet never gave it o'er. Sometimes I said: It is an empty name I long for; to a name why should I give The peace of all the days I have to live?— Yet gave it all the same. Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit For healthy joy and salutary pain; Thou knowest the chase useless, and again Turnest to follow it. 2. My happy happy dream is finished with, My dream in which alone I lived so long. My heart slept—woe is me, it wakeneth; Was weak—I thought it strong. Oh weary wakening from a life-true dream: Oh pleasant dream from which I wake in pain: I rested all my trust on things that seem, And all my trust is vain. I must pull down my palace that I built, Dig up the pleasure-gardens of my soul; Must change my laughter to sad tears for guilt, My freedom to control. Now all the cherished secrets of my heart, Now all my hidden hopes are turned to sin: Part of my life is dead, part sick, and part Is all on fire within. The fruitless thought of what I might have been Hauthing me ever will not let me rest: A cold north wind has withered all my green, My sun is in the west. But where my palace stood, with the same stone, I will uprear a shady hermitage; And there my spirit shall keep house alone, Accomplishing its age: There other garden beds shall lie around Full of sweet-briar and incense-bearing thyme; There I will sit, and listen for the sound Of the last lingering chime. 3. I thought to deal the death-stroke at a blow, To give all, once for all, but nevermore;— Then sit to hear the low waves fret the shore, Or watch the silent snow. “Oh rest,” I thought, “in silence and the dark; Oh rest, if nothing else, from head to feet: Though I may see no more the poppied wheat, Or sunny soaring lark. “These chimes are slow, but surely strike at last; This sand is slow, but surely droppeth thro'; And much there is to suffer, much to do, Before the time be past. “So will I labour, but will not rejoice: Will do and bear, but will not hope again; Gone dead alike to pulses of quick pain, And pleasure's counterpoise:” I said so in my heart, and so I thought My life would lapse, a tedious monotone: I thought to shut myself, and dwell alone Unseeking and unsought. But first I tired, and then my care grew slack; Till my heart slumbered, may-be wandered too:— I felt the sunshine glow again, and knew The swallow on its track; All birds awoke to building in the leaves, All buds awoke to fulness and sweet scent, Ah, too, my heart woke unawares, intent On fruitful harvest sheaves. Full pulse of life, that I had deemed was dead, Full throb of youth, that I had deemed at rest,— Alas, I cannot build myself a nest, I cannot crown my head With royal purple blossoms for the feast, Nor flush with laughter, nor exult in song;— These joys may drift, as time now drifts along; And cease, as once they ceased. I may pursue, and yet may not attain, Athirst and panting all the days I live: Or seem to hold, yet nerve myself to give What once I gave, again. Long looked for. When the eye hardly sees, And the pulse hardly stirs, And the heart would scarcely quicken Though the voice were hers: Then the longing wasting fever Will be almost past; Sleep indeed come back again, And peace at last. Not till then, dear friends, Not till then, most like, most dear, The dove will fold its wings To settle here. Then to all her coldness I also shall be cold, Then I also have forgotten Our happy love of old. Close mine eyes with care, Cross my hands upon my breast, Let shadows and full silence Tell of rest: For she yet may look upon me Too proud to speak, but know One heart less loves her in the world Than loved her long ago. Strew flowers upon the bed And flowers upon the floor, Let all be sweet and comely When she stands at the door: Fair as a bridal chamber For her to come into, When the sunny day is over At falling of the dew. If she comes, watch her not But careless turn aside; She may weep if left alone With her beauty and her pride: She may pluck a leaf perhaps Or a languid violet When life and love are finished And even I forget. Listening. She listened like a cushat dove That listens to its mate alone; She listened like a cushat dove That loves but only one. Not fair as men would reckon fair, Nor noble as they count the line; Only as graceful as a bough And tendrils of the vine; Only as noble as sweet Eve Your ancestress and mine. And downcast were her dovelike eyes, And downcast was her tender cheek, Her pulses fluttered like a dove To hear him speak. Zara (see Maturin's Women.) I dreamed that loving me he would love on Thro' life and death into eternity: I dreamed that love would be and be and be As surely as the sun shines that once shone. Now even that my dream is killed and gone, It sometimes even now returns to me; Not what it was, but half being memory, And half the pain that wears my cheek so wan. Oh bitter pain, what drug will lull the pain? Oh lying memory, when shall I forget? For why should I remember him in vain Who hath forgotten and rejoiceth still? Oh bitter memory, while my heart is set Oh love that gnaws and gnaws and cannot kill. The last look. Her face was like an opening rose, So bright to look upon; But now it is like fallen snows, As cold, as dead, as wan. Heaven lit with stars is more like her Than is this empty crust; Deaf, dumb and blind it cannot stir But crumbles back to dust. No flower be taken from her bed For me, no lock be shorn; I give her up, the early dead, The dead, the newly born: If I remember her, no need Of formal tokens set; Of hollow token lies, indeed, No need, if I forget. “I have a message unto thee.” (written in sickness.) Green sprout the grasses, Red blooms the mossy rose, Blue nods the harebell Where purple heather blows; The water lily, silver white, Is living—fair as light; Sweet jasmine branches trail A dusky starry veil: Each goodly is to see, Comely in its degree; I, only I, alas that this should be, Am ruinously pale. New year renews the grasses, The crimson rose renews, Brings up the breezy bluebell, Refreshes heath with dews; Then water lilies ever Bud fresh upon the river; Then jasmine lights its star And spreads its arms afar: I only in my spring Can neither bud nor sing; I find not honey but a sting Though fair the blossoms are. For me no downy grasses, For me no blossoms pluck; But leave them for the breezes, For honey bees to suck, For childish hands to pull And pile their baskets full: I will not have a crown That soon must be laid down; Trust me: I cannot care A withering crown to wear, I who may be immortally made fair Where autumn turns not brown. Spring, summer, autumn, Winter, all will pass, With tender blossoms And with fruitful grass. Sweet days of yore Will pass to come no more, Sweet perfumes fly, Buds languish and go by: Oh bloom that cannot last, Oh blossoms quite gone past, I yet shall feast when you shall fast, And live when you shall die. Your workday fully ended, Your pleasant task being done, You shall finish with the stars, The moon and setting sun. You and these and time Shall end with the last chime; For earthly solace given, But needed not in heaven. Needed not perhaps Thro' the eternal lapse: Or else, all signs fulfilled, What you foreshow may yield Delights thro' heaven's own harvest field With undecaying saps. Young girls wear flowers, Young brides a flowery wreath; But next we plant them In garden plots of death. Whose sleep is best?— The maiden's curtained rest, Or bride's whose hoped for sweet May yet outstrip her feet?— Ah, what are such as these To death's sufficing ease— How long and deep that slumber is Where night and morning meet. Dear are the blossoms For bride's or maiden's head, But dearer planted Around our happy dead. Those mind us of decay And joys that slip away; These preach to us perfection And endless resurrection. We make our graveyards fair For spirit-like birds of air; For Angels, may be, finding there Lost Eden's own delection. A blessing on the flowers That God has made so good, From crops of jealous gardens To wildlings of a wood. They show us symbols deep Of how to sow and reap; They teach us lessons plain Of patient harvest gain. They still are telling of God's unimagined love:— “Oh gift,” they say, “all gifts above, “Shall it be given in vain?— “Better you had not seen us “But shared the blind man's night, “Better you had not scented “Our incense of delight, “Than only plucked to scorn “The rosebud for its thorn: “Not so the instinctive thrush “Hymns in a holly bush. “Be wise betimes, and with the bee “Suck sweets from prickly tree “To last when earth's are flown; “So God well pleased will own “Your work, and bless not time alone “But ripe eternity.” Cobwebs. It is a land with neither night nor day, Nor heat nor cold, nor any wind, nor rain, Nor hills nor valleys; but one even plain Stretches thro' long unbroken miles away: While thro' the sluggish air a twilight grey Broodeth; no moons or seasons wax and wane, No ebb and flow are there along the main, No bud-time no leaf-falling there for aye, No ripple on the sea, no shifting sand, No beat of wings to stir the stagnant space, No pulse of life thro' all the loveless land: And loveless sea; no trace of days before, No guarded home, no toil-won restingplace No future hope no fear for evermore. Unforgotten. Oh unforgotten! How long ago? one spirit saith: As long as life even unto death, The passage of a poor frail breath. Oh unforgotten: An unforgotten load of love, A load of grief all griefs above, A blank blank nest without its dove. As long as time is— No longer? time is but a span The dalliance space of empty man; And is this all immortals can?— Ever and ever, Beyond all time, beyond all space;— Now, shadow darkening heart and face,— Then, glory in a glorious place. Sad heart and spirit Bowed now yea broken for a while, Lagging and toiling mile by mile Yet pressing toward the eternal smile. Oh joy eternal!— Oh youth eternal without flaw!— Thee not the blessed angels saw Rapt in august adoring awe. Not the dead have thee, Not yet O all surpassing peace; Not till this veiling world shall cease And harvest yield its whole increase. Not the dead know thee, Not dead nor living nor unborn: Who in the new sown field at morn Can measure out the harvest corn?— Yet they shall know thee; And we with them, and unborn men With us, shall know and have thee when The single grain shall wax to ten. An Afterthought. Oh lost garden Paradise:— Were the roses redder there Than they blossom otherwhere? Was the night's delicious shade More intensely star inlaid? Who can tell what memories Of lost beloved Paradise Saddened Eve with sleepless eyes?— Fair first mother lulled to rest In a choicer garden nest, Curtained with a softer shading Than thy tenderest child is laid in, Was the sundawn brighter far Than our daily sundawns are? Was that love, first love of all Warmer, deeper, better worth Than has warmed poor hearts of earth Since the utter ruinous fall?— Ah supremely happy once, Ah supremely broken hearted When her tender feet departed From the accustomed paths of peace: Catching Angel orisons For the last last time of all, Shedding tears that would not cease For the bitter bitter fall. Yet the accustomed hand for leading, Yet the accustomed heart for love; Sure she kept one part of Eden Angels could not strip her of. Sure the fiery messenger Kindling for his outraged Lord, Willing with the perfect Will, Yet rejoiced the flaming sword Chastening sore but sparing still Shut her treasure out with her. What became of Paradise? Did the cedars droop at all (Springtide hastening to the fall) Missing the beloved hand— Or did their green perfection stand Unmoved beneath the perfect skies?— Paradise was rapt on high, It lies before the gate of Heaven:— Eve now slumbers there forgiven, Slumbers Rachel comforted, Slumber all the blessed dead Of days and months and years gone by, A solemn swelling company. They wait for us beneath the trees Of Paradise that lap of ease: They wait for us, till God shall please. Oh come the day of death, that day Of rest which cannot pass away: When the last work is wrought, the last Pang of pain is felt and past And the blessed door made fast. To the end. There are lilies for her sisters— (Who so cold as they?)— And heartsease for one I must not name When I am far away. I shall pluck the lady lilies And fancy all the rest; I shall pluck the bright eyed heartsease For her sake I love the best, As I wander on with weary feet Toward the twilight shadowy west. Oh bird that fliest eastward Unto that sunny land Oh wilt thou 'light on lilies white Beside her whiter hand? Soft summer wind that breathest Of perfumes and sweet spice, Ah tell her what I dare not tell Of watchful waiting eyes Of love that yet may meet again In distant Paradise. I go from earth to Heaven A dim uncertain road, A houseless pilgrim thro' the world Unto a sure abode: While evermore an Angel Goes with me day and night, A ministering spirit From the land of light, My holy fellow servant sent To guide my steps aright. I wonder if the Angels Love with such love as our's, If for each other's sake they pluck And keep eternal flowers. Alone I am and weary, Alone yet not alone: Her soul talks with me by the way From tedious stone to stone, A blessed Angel treads with me The awful paths unknown. When will the long road end in rest, The sick bird perch and brood? When will my Guardian fold his wings At rest in the finished good?— Lulling lulling me off to sleep: While death's strong hand doth roll My sins behind His back, And my life up like a scroll, Till thro' sleep I hear kind Angels Rejoicing at the goal. If her spirit went before me Up from night to day, It would pass me like the lightning That kindles on its way. I should feel it like the lightning Flashing fresh from Heaven: I should long for Heaven sevenfold more, Yea and sevenfold seven; Should pray as I have not prayed before, And strive as I have not striven. She will learn new love in Heaven Who is so full of love, She will learn new depths of tenderness Who is tender like a dove. Her heart will no more sorrow, Her eyes will weep no more: Yet it may be she will yearn And look back from far before: Lingering on the golden threshold And leaning from the door. “Zion said.” O Slain for love of me, canst Thou be cold, Be cold and far away in my distress: Is Thy love also changed growing less and less That carried me thro' all the days of old?— O Slain for love of me, O Love untold, See how I flag and fail thro' weariness: I flag, while sleepless foes dog me and press On me; behold O Lord, O Love behold. I am sick for home, the home of love indeed; I am sick for Love, that dearest name for Thee: Thou Who hast bled, see how my heart doth bleed; Open Thy bleeding Side and let me in; Oh hide me in Thy Heart from doubt and sin, Oh take me to Thyself and comfort me. May. Sweet Life is dead.— Not so: I meet him day by day, Where bluest fountains flow And trees are white as snow For it is time of May. Even now from long ago He will not say me nay; He is most fair to see; And if I wander forth, I know He wanders forth with me. But Life is dead to me; The worn-out year was failing West winds took up a wailing To watch his funeral: Bare poplars shivered tall And lank vines stretched to see; 'Twixt him and me a wall Was frozen of earth like stone With brambles overgrown; Chill darkness wrapped him like a pall And I am left alone. How can you call him dead? He buds out everywhere: In every hedgerow rank, On every mossgrown bank I find him here and there. He crowns my willing head With may flowers white and red, He rears my tender heartsease bed; He makes my branch to bud and bear, And blossoms where I tread. River Thames (?). There are rivers lapsing down Lily-laden to the sea; Every lily is a boat For bees, one, two, or three: I wish there were a fairy boat For you, my friend, and me. We would rock upon the river, Scarcely floating by; Rocking rocking like the lilies, You, my friend, and I; Rocking like the stately lilies Beneath the statelier sky. But ah, where is that river Whose hyacinth banks descend Down to the sweeter lilies, Till soft their shadows blend Into a watery twilight?— And ah, where is my friend?— A chilly night. I rose at the dead of night And went to the lattice alone To look for my Mother's ghost Where the ghostly moonlight shone. My friends had failed one by one, Middleaged, young, and old, Till the ghosts were warmer to me Than my friends that had grown cold. I looked and I saw the ghosts Dotting plain and mound: They stood in the blank moonlight But no shadow lay on the ground; They spoke without a voice And they leapt without a sound. I called: “O my Mother dear,”— I sobbed: “O my Mother kind, Make a lonely bed for me And shelter it from the wind: “Tell the others not to come To see me night or day; But I need not tell my friends To be sure to keep away.” My Mother raised her eyes, They were blank and could not see; Yet they held me with their stare While they seemed to look at me. She opened her mouth and spoke, I could not hear a word While my flesh crept on my bones And every hair was stirred. She knew that I could not hear The message that she told Whether I had long to wait Or soon should sleep in the mould: I saw her toss her shadowless hair And wring her hands in the cold. I strained to catch her words And she strained to make me hear, But never a sound of words Fell on my straining ear. From midnight to the cockcrow I kept my watch in pain While the subtle ghosts grew subtler In the sad night on the wane. From midnight to the cockcrow I watched till all were gone, Some to sleep in the shifting sea And some under turf and stone: Living had failed and dead had failed And I was indeed alone. “Let patience have her perfect work.” I saw a bird alone, In its nest it sat alone, For its mate was dead or flown Tho' it was early spring. Hard by were buds half blown, With cornfields freshly sown; It could only perch and moan That used to sing: Droop in sorrow left alone A sad sad thing. I saw a star alone, In blue heaven it hung alone, A solitary throne In the waste of space: Where no moon glories are, Where not a second star Beams thro' night from near or far To that lone place. Its beauties all unknown, Its glories all alone Sad in heaven's face. Doth the bird desire a mate, Pine for a second mate Whose first joy was so great With its own dove? Doth the star supreme in night Desire a second light To make it seem less bright In the shrine of heavenly height That is above?— Ah, better wait alone, In nest or heaven alone, Forsaken or unknown; Till time being past and gone Full eternity rolls on, While patience reaps what it has sown In the harvest land of love. A Martyr. It is over the horrible pain, All is over the struggle and doubt, She's asleep tho' her friends stand and weep, She's asleep while the multitudes shout, Not to wake to her anguish again Not to wake until death is cast out. Stoop, look at the beautiful face, See the smile on the satisfied mouth, The hands crost—she hath conquered not lost, She hath drunk who was fevered with drouth. She shall sleep in her safe restingplace While the hawk spreads her wings toward the south. She shall sleep while slow seasons are given, While daylight and darkness go round; Her heart is at rest in its nest; Her body at rest in the ground: She has travelled the long road to heaven, She sought it and now she has found. Will you follow the track that she trod, Will you tread in her footsteps, my friend? That pathway is rough but enough Are the light and the balm that attend. Do I tread in her steps, O my God, Shall I joy with her joy in the end? In the Lane. When my love came home to me Pleasant Summer bringing Every tree was out in leaf Every bird was singing Every red rose burst the bud On its bramble springing. There I met her in the lane By those waters gleamy, Met her toward the fall of day Warm and dear and dreamy; Did I loiter in the lane? None was there to see me. Only roses in the hedge Lilies on the river Saw our greeting fast and fond, Counted gift and giver, Saw me take her to my home Take her home for ever. Acme. Sleep, unforgotten sorrow, sleep awhile; Make even awhile as tho' I might forget, Let the wound staunch thy tedious fingers fret Till once again I look abroad and smile Warmed in the sunlight: let no tears defile This hour's content, no conscious thorns beset My path; O sorrow slumber, slumber yet A moment, rouse not yet the smouldering pile. So shalt thou wake again with added strength O unforgotten sorrow, stir again The slackening fire, refine the lulling pain To quickened torture and a subtler edge: The wrung cord snaps at last; beneath the wedge The toughest oak groans long but rends at length. A bed of Forget-me-nots. Is love so prone to change and rot We are fain to rear forget-me-not By measure in a garden plot?— I love its growth at large and free By untrod path and unlopped tree, Or nodding by the unpruned hedge, Or on the water's dangerous edge Where flags and meadowsweet blow rank With rushes on the quaking bank. Love is not taught in learning's school, Love is not parcelled out by rule; Hath curb or call an answer got?— So free must be forget-me-not. Give me the flame no dampness dulls, The passion of the instinctive pulse, Love steadfast as a fixèd star, Tender as doves with nestlings are, More large than time, more strong than death: This all creation travails of— She groans not for a passing breath— This is forget-me-not and love. The Chiefest among ten thousand. When sick of life and all the world, How sick of all the earth but Thee, I lift mine eyes up to the hills, Eyes of my heart that truly see: I see beyond all death and ills Refreshing green for heart and eyes; The golden streets and gateways pearled, The living trees of paradise. Oh that a dove's white wings I had To flee away from this distress For Thou art in the wilderness Drawing and leading Thine Own love: Wherefore it blossoms like a rose, The solitary place is glad; There sounds the soft voice of the dove And there the spicy south wind blows. Draw us, we will run after Thee; Call us by name, the name we know; Call her beloved who was not so, Beulah and blessed Hepzibah: That where Thou art I too may be Bride of the Bridegroom heart to heart; Thou God, my Love, the Fairest art Where all things fair and lovely are. From north and south from east and west Thy sons and daughters all shall flock Who built their house upon the Rock And eagle-like renew their strength: How glad and glorious is their rest Whom Thou hast purged from fleshly scum,— The long-desired is come at length, The fulness of the time is come. Then the new heavens and earth shall be Where righteousness shall dwell indeed: There shall be no more blight nor need Nor barrier of the tossing sea; No sun and moon alternating For God shall be the Light thereof, No sorrow more no death no sting For God shall reign and God is Love. “Look on this picture and on this.” I wish we once were wedded,—then I must be true; You should hold my will in yours to do or to undo: But now I hate myself Eva when I look at you. You have seen her hazel eyes, her warm dark skin, Dark hair—but oh those hazel eyes a devil is dancing in:— You my saint lead up to heaven she lures down to sin. Listen Eva I repent, indeed I do my love: How should I choose a peacock and leave and grieve a dove?— If I could turn my back on her and follow you above. No it's not her beauty bloomed like an autumn peach, Not her pomp of beauty too high for me to reach; It's her eyes, her witching manner—ah the lore they teach You are winning, well I know it, who should know but I? You constrain me, I must yield or else must hasten by:— But she, she fascinates me, I can neither fight nor fly. She's so redundant, stately;—in truth now have you seen Ever anywhere such beauty, such a stature, such a mien? She may be queen of devils but she's every inch a queen. If you sing to me, I hear her subtler sweeter still Whispering in each tender cadence strangely sweet to fill All that lacks in music all my soul and sense and will. If you dance, tho' mine eyes follow where my hand I gave I only see her presence like a sunny wave I only feel her presence like a wind too strong to rave. If we talk: I love you, do you love me again?— Tho' your lips speak it's her voice I flush to hear so plain Say: Love you? yes I love you, love can neither change nor wane. But, you ask, “why struggle? I have given you up: Take again your pledges, snap the cord and break the cup: Feast you with your temptation for I in heaven will sup.”— Can I bear to think upon you strong to break not bend, Pale with inner intense passion silent to the end, Bear to leave you, bear to grieve you, O my dove my friend? One short pang and you would rise a light in heaven While we grovelled in the darkness mean and unforgiven Tho' our cup of love brimmed sevenfold crowns of love were seven. What shall I choose, what can I for you and her and me; With you the haven of rest, with her the tossing miry sea; Time's love with her, or choose with you love's all eternity.— Nay, you answer coldly yet with a quivering voice: That is over, doubt and struggle, we have sealed our choice; Leave me to my contentment vivid with fresh hopes and joys. Listening so, I hide mine eyes and fancy years to come: You cherished in another home with no cares burdensome; You straitened in a windingsheet pulseless at peace and dumb. So I fancy—The new love has driven the old away; She has found a dearer shelter a dearer stronger stay; Perhaps now she would thank me for the freedom of that day. Open house and heart barred to me alone the door; Children bound to meet her, babies crow before;— Blessed wife and blessed mother whom I may see no more. Or I fancy—In the grave her comely body lies; She is 'tiring for the Bridegroom till the morning star shall rise, Then to shine a glory in the nuptials of the skies. No more yearning tenderness, no more pale regret, She will not look for me when the marriage guests are set, She joys with joy eternal as we had never met. I would that one of us were dead, were gone no more to meet, Or she and I were dead together stretched here at your feet, That she and I were strained together in one winding sheet: Hidden away from all the world upon this bitter morn; Hidden from all the scornful world, from all your keener scorn; Secure and secret in the dark as blessed babe unborn. A pitiless fiend is in your eyes to tempt me and to taunt: If you were dead I verily believe that you would haunt The home you loved, the man you loved, you said you loved—avaunt. Why do you face me with those eyes so calm they drive me mad, Too proud to droop before me and own that you are sad? Why have you a lofty angel made me mean and cursed and bad? How have you the heart to face me with that passion in your stare Deathly silent? weep before me, rave at me in your despair— If you keep patience wings will spring and a halo from your hair. Yet what matters—yea what matters? your frenzy can but mock: You do not hold my heart's life key to lock and to unlock, The door will not unclose to you tho' long you wait and knock. Have I wronged you? nay not I nor she in deed or will: You it is alone that mingle the venomous cup and fill; Why are you so little lovely that I cannot love you still?— One pulse, one tone, one ringlet of her's outweighs the whole Of you, your puny graces puny body puny soul: You but a taste of sweetness, she an overrunning bowl. Did I make you, that you blame me because you are not the best? Not so, be wise, take patience, turn away and be at rest: Shall I not know her lovelier who is far loveliest?— See now how proud you are, like us after all, no saint; Not so upright but that you are bowed with the old bent; White at white-heat, tainted with the devil's special taint. Sit you still and wring the cup drop after loathsome drop: You have let loose a torrent it is not you can stop; You have sowed a noisome field-ful, now reap the stinging crop. Did you think to sit in safety, to watch me torn and tost Struggling like a mad dog, watch her tempting doubly lost? Howl you, you wretched woman, for your flimsy hopes are crost. Be still, tho' you may writhe you shall hear the branding truth: You who thought to sit in judgment on our souls forsooth, To sit in frigid judgment on our ripe luxuriant youth. Did I love you? never from the first cold day to this; You are not sufficient for my aim of life, my bliss; You are not sufficient, but I found the one that is. The wine of love that warms me from this life's mortal chill: Drunk with love I drink again, a thirst I drink my fill; Lapped in love I care not doth it make alive or kill. Then did I never love you?—ah the sting struck home at last; You are drooping, fainting, dying—the worst of death is past; A light is on your face from the nearing heaven forecast. Never?—yes I loved you then; I loved: the word still charms:— For the first time last time lie here in my heart my arms, For the first last time as if I shielded you from harms. I trampled you, poor dove, to death; you clung to me, I spurned; I taunted you, I tortured you, while you sat still and yearned:— Oh lesson taught in anguish but in double anguish learned. For after all I loved you, loved you then, I love you yet. Listen love I love you: see, the seal of truth is set On my face in tears—you cannot see? then feel them wet. Pause at heaven's dear gate, look back, one moment back to grieve; You go home thro' death to life; but I, I still must live: On the threshold of heaven's love, O love can you forgive?— Fully freely fondly, with heart truth above an oath, With eager utter pardon given unasked and nothing loth, Heaping coals of fire upon our heads forgiving both. One word more—not one: one look more—too late too late:— Lapped in love she sleeps who was lashed with scorn and hate; Nestling in the lap of love the dove has found a mate. Night has come, the night of rest; day will come, that day: To her glad dawn of glory kindled from the deathless ray; To us a searching fire and strict balances to weigh. The tearless tender eyes are closed, the tender lips are dumb: I shall not see or hear them more until that day shall come: Then they must speak, what will they say—what then will be the sum?— Shall we stand upon the left and she upon the right— We smirched with endless death and shame, she glorified in white: Will she sound our accusation in intolerable light? Be open-armed to us in love—type of another Love— As she forgave us once below will she forgive above, Enthroned to all eternity our sister friend and dove?— “Now they desire.” There is a sleep we have not slept Safe in a bed unknown; There hearts are staunched that long have wept Alone, or bled alone: Sweet sleep that dreams not, or whose dream Is foretaste of the truth; Sweet sleep whose sweets are what they seem Refreshing more than youth. There is a sea whose waters clear Are never tempest tost; There is a home whose children dear Are saved, not one is lost: There Cherubim and Seraphim And Angels dwell with Saints, Whose lustre no more dwindleth dim, Whose ardour never faints. There is a Love Which fills desire And can our love requite; Like fire It draws our lesser fire, Like greater light our light: For It we agonize in strife We yearn we famish thus— Lo, in the far off land of life Doth It not yearn for us?— “Oh fair oh fair Jerusalem,” How fair how far away, When shall we see thy Jasper Gem That gives thee light for day? Thy sea of glass like fire, thy streets Of glass like virgin gold, Thy royal Elders on their seats, Thy four Beasts manifold?— Fair city of delights, the bride In raiment white and clean, When shall we see thee loving eyed, Sun girdled, happy Queen? Without a wrinkle or a spot, Blood cleansed, blood purchased once: In how fair ground is fallen the lot Of all thy happy sons. Dove's eyes beneath thy parted lock, A dove's soft voice is thine; Thy nest is safe within the Rock, Safe in the Very Vine; Thy walls salvation buildeth them And all thy gates are praise Oh fair oh fair Jerusalem In sevenfold day of days. A Christmas Carol, for my Godchildren. The shepherds had an angel, The wise men had a star, But what have I, a little child, To guide me home from far, Where glad stars sing together And singing angels are?— Lord Jesus is my Guardian, So I can nothing lack: The lambs lie in His Bosom Along life's dangerous track; The wilful lambs that go astray He bleeding fetches back. Lord Jesus is my Guiding Star, My Beacon Light in heaven: He leads me step by step along The path of life uneven; He, True Light, leads me to that land Whose day shall be as seven. Those shepherds thro' the lonely night Sat watching by their sheep, Until they saw the heavenly host Who neither tire nor sleep All singing ‘Glory glory’ In festival they keep. Christ watches me His little lamb, Cares for me day and night, That I may be His Own in heaven: So angels clad in white Shall sing their ‘Glory, glory’ For my sake in the height. The wise men left their country To journey morn by morn With gold and frankincense and myrrh Because the Lord was born: God sent a star to guide them And sent a dream to warn. My life is like their journey, Their star is like God's Book, I must be like those good wise men With heavenward heart and look: But shall I give no gifts to God?— What precious gifts they took. Lord I will give my love to Thee, Than gold much costlier, Sweeter to Thee than frankincense, More prized than choicest myrrh: Lord make me dearer day by day, Day by day holier. Nearer and dearer day by day: Till I my voice unite And sing my ‘Glory, glory’ With angels clad in white, All ‘Glory, glory’ given to Thee Thro' all the heavenly height. “Not yours but you.” He died for me: what can I offer Him? Toward Him swells incense of perpetual prayer; His court wear crowns and aureoles round their hair; His ministers are subtle cherubim, Ring within ring, white intense seraphim Leap like immortal lightnings thro' the air: What shall I offer Him? defiled and bare My spirit broken and my brightness dim.— Give Me thy youth;—I yield it to Thy rod As Thou didst yield Thy prime of youth for me:— Give Me thy life;—I give it breath by breath As Thou didst give Thy life so give I Thee:— Give Me thy love;—So be it, my God, my God, As Thou hast loved me even to bitter death. An Answer. [The first page of the MS is missing from the notebook.] To make it glad with a goodly crop: Even so One Wiser deals with me:— Amen, say I: if He choose to lop Branch after branch of my leafèd tree, In its own ripe season more fruit shall be. Tenfold fruit in the time of fruit, In the time of corn and wine and oil, Sound at the core, firm at the root; Repaying the years and years of toil, Repaying the blood that fed the soil. Sir Winter. Sir Winter is coming across the wide sea, With his blustering companions, so wild and so free: He speeds on his way, like some bold buccaneer, And Day flies before him with faltering and fear. In the front of the battle new trophies to reap, Mid the howl of the tempest, the roar of the deep, Lo, he comes Down to the these verses are written by Mr. Jervis. with his noiseless-shod legions of snow And nips the last buds that were lingering to blow. Sweet blackbird is silenced with chaffinch and thrush, Only waistcoated robin still chirps in the bush: Soft sun-loving swallows have mustered in force And winged to the spice-teaming southlands their course. Plump housekeeper dormouse has tucked himself neat, Just a brown ball in moss with a morsel to eat; Armed hedgehog has huddled him into the hedge While frogs miss freezing deep down in the sedge. So sturdy Sir Winter has conquered us quite, He has ravaged our country to left and to right: Since we must bear his yoke for a season, we'd best Try to lighten its weight on ourselves and the rest. Soft swallows have left us alone in the lurch, But robin sits whistling to us from his perch: If I were red robin, I'd pipe you a tune Would make you despise all the beauties of June. But since that cannot be, let us draw round the fire, Munch chestnuts, tell stories, and stir the blaze higher: We'll comfort pinched robin with crumbs, little man, Till he sings us the very best song that he can. In an Artist's Studio. One face looks out from all his canvasses, One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans; We found her hidden just behind those screens, That mirror gave back all her loveliness. A queen in opal or in ruby dress, A nameless girl in freshest summer greens, A saint, an angel;—every canvass means The same one meaning, neither more nor less. He feeds upon her face by day and night, And she with true kind eyes looks back on him Fair as the moon and joyful as the light: Not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim; Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright; Not as she is, but as she fills his dream. Introspective. I wish it were over the terrible pain, Pang after pang again and again; First the shattering ruining blow, Then the probing steady and slow. Did I wince? I did not faint: My soul broke but was not bent; Up I stand like a blasted tree By the shore of the shivering sea. On my boughs neither leaf nor fruit, No sap in my uttermost root, Brooding in an anguish dumb On the short past and the long to come. Dumb I was when the ruin fell, Dumb I remain and will never tell: O my soul I talk with thee But not another the sight must see. I did not start when the torture stung, I did not faint when the torture wrung; Let it come tenfold if come it must But I will not groan when I bite the dust. “The heart knoweth its own bitterness.” When all the over-work of life Is finished once, and fast asleep We swerve no more beneath the knife But taste that silence cool and deep; Forgetful of the highways rough, Forgetful of the thorny scourge, Forgetful of the tossing surge, Then shall we find it is enough?— How can we say ‘enough’ on earth; ‘Enough’ with such a craving heart: I have not found it since my birth But still have bartered part for part. I have not held and hugged the whole, But paid the old to gain the new; Much have I paid, yet much is due, Till I am beggared sense and soul. I used to labour, used to strive For pleasure with a restless will: Now if I save my soul alive All else what matters, good or ill? I used to dream alone, to plan Unspoken hopes and days to come:— Of all my past this is the sum: I will not lean on child of man. To give, to give, not to receive, I long to pour myself, my soul, Not to keep back or count or leave But king with king to give the whole: I long for one to stir my deep— I have had enough of help and gift— I long for one to search and sift Myself, to take myself and keep. You scratch my surface with your pin; You stroke me smooth with hushing breath;— Nay pierce, nay probe, nay dig within, Probe my quick core and sound my depth. You call me with a puny call, You talk, you smile, you nothing do; How should I spend my heart on you, My heart that so outweighs you all? Your vessels are by much too strait; Were I to pour you could not hold, Bear with me: I must bear to wait A fountain sealed thro' heat and cold. Bear with me days or months or years; Deep must call deep until the end When friend shall no more envy friend Nor vex his friend at unawares. Not in this world of hope deferred, This world of perishable stuff;— Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, Nor heart conceived that full ‘enough’: Here moans the separating sea, Here harvests fail, here breaks the heart; There God shall join and no man part, I full of Christ and Christ of me. “Reflection”. Gazing thro' her chamber window Sits my soul's dear soul; Looking northward, looking southward, Looking to the goal, Looking back without control.— I have strewn thy path, beloved, With plumed meadowsweet, Iris and pale perfumed lilies, Roses most complete: Wherefore pause on listless feet?— But she sits and never answers; Gazing gazing still On swift fountain, shadowed valley, Cedared sunlit hill: Who can guess or read her will? Who can guess or read the spirit Shrined within her eyes, Part a longing, part a languor, Part a mere surprize, While slow mists do rise and rise?— Is it love she looks and longs for; Is it rest or peace; Is it slumber self-forgetful In its utter ease; Is it one or all of these? So she sits and doth not answer With her dreaming eyes, With her languid look delicious Almost Paradise, Less than happy, over wise. Answer me, O self-forgetful— Or of what beside?— Is it day dream of a maiden, Vision of a bride, Is it knowledge, love, or pride? Cold she sits thro' all my kindling, Deaf to all I pray: I have wasted might and wisdom, Wasted night and day: Deaf she dreams to all I say. Now if I could guess her secret Were it worth the guess?— Time is lessening, hope is lessening, Love grows less and less: What care I for no or yes?— I will give her stately burial, Tho', when she lies dead: For dear memory of the past time, Of her royal head, Of the much I strove and said. I will give her stately burial, Willow branches bent; Have her carved in alabaster, As she dreamed and leant While I wondered what she meant. A Coast-Nightmare. I have a friend in ghostland— Early found, ah me, how early lost!— Blood-red seaweeds drip along that coastland By the strong sea wrenched and tossed. In every creek there slopes a dead man's islet, And such an one in every bay; All unripened in the unended twilight: For there comes neither night nor day. Unripe harvest there hath none to reap it From the watery misty place; Unripe vineyard there hath none to keep it In unprofitable space. Living flocks and herds are nowhere found there; Only ghosts in flocks and shoals: Indistinguished hazy ghosts surround there Meteors whirling on their poles; Indistinguished hazy ghosts abound there; Troops, yea swarms, of dead men's souls.— Have they towns to live in?— They have towers and towns from sea to sea; Of each town the gates are seven; Of one of these each ghost is free. Civilians, soldiers, seamen, Of one town each ghost is free: They are ghastly men those ghostly freemen: Such a sight may you not see.— How know you that your lover Of death's tideless waters stoops to drink?— Me by night doth mouldy darkness cover, It makes me quake to think: All night long I feel his presence hover Thro' the darkness black as ink. Without a voice he tells me The wordless secrets of death's deep: If I sleep, his trumpet voice compels me To stalk forth in my sleep: If I wake, he hunts me like a nightmare; I feel my hair stand up, my body creep: Without light I see a blasting sight there, See a secret I must keep. ‘For one Sake.’ One passed me like a flash of lightning by To ring clear bells of heaven beyond the stars: Then said I: Wars and rumours of your wars Are dull with din of what and where and why; My heart is where these troubles draw not nigh: Let me alone till heaven shall burst its bars, Break up its fountains, roll its flashing cars Earthwards with fire to test and purify. Let me alone tonight, and one night more Of which I shall not count the eventide; Its morrow will not be as days before: Let me alone to dream, perhaps to weep; To dream of her the imperishable bride, Dream while I wake and dream on while I sleep. My old Friends. They lie at rest asleep and dead, The dew drops cool above their head, They knew not when past summer fled— Amen. They lie at rest and quite forget The hopes and fears that wring us yet; Their eyes are set, their heart is set— Amen. They lie with us, yet gone away Hear nothing that we sob or say Beneath the thorn of wintry may— Miserere. Together all yet each alone, Each laid at rest beneath his own Smooth turf or white appointed stone— Amen. When shall our slumbers be so deep, And bleeding heart and eyes that weep Lie lapped in the sufficient sleep?— Miserere. We dream of them: and who shall say They never dream while far away Of us between the night and day?— Sursum corda. Gone far away: or it may be They lean toward us and hear and see Yea and remember more than we— Amen. For wherefore should we deem them far Who know not where those spirits are That shall outshine both moon and star?— Hallelujah. Where check or change can never rise Deep in recovered Paradise They rest world-wearied heart and eyes— Jubilate. We hope and love with throbbing breast, They hope and love and are at rest: And yet we question which is best— Miserere. Oh what is earth, that we should build Brief houses here, and seek concealed Poor treasure, and add field to field And heap to heap and store to store, Still grasping, ever grasping more, While death stands knocking at our door?— Cui bono? But one will answer: Changed and pale And starved at heart, I thirst I fail For love, I thirst without avail— Miserrima. Sweet love, a fountain sealed to me: Mere love, the sole sufficiency For every longing that can be— Amen. Oh happy those alone whose lot Is love: I search from spot to spot; In life, in death, I find it not— Miserrima. Not found in life: nay, verily. I too have sought: come sit with me And grief for grief shall answer thee— Miserrima. Sit with me where the sapless leaves Are fallen and sere: to one who grieves What cheer have last year's harvest sheaves?— Cui bono? Not found in life: yet found in death. I sought life as but a breath There is a nest of love beneath The sod, a home prepared before; Our brethren whom one mother bore Live there, and toil and ache no more— Hallelujah. Dear friends and kinsfolk great and small; Not lost but saved both one and all: They watch across the parting wall (Do they not watch?) and count the creep Of time, and sound the shallowing deep, Till we in port shall also sleep— Hallelujah, Amen. “Yet a little while”. These days are long before I die: To sit alone upon a thorn Is what the nightingale forlorn Does night by night continually; She swells her heart to extasy Until it bursts and she can die. These days are long that wane and wax: Waxeth and wanes the ghostly moon Achill and pale in cordial June; What is it that she wandering lacks? She seems as one that aches and aches Most sick to wane most sick to wax. Of all the sad sights in the world The downfall of an Autumn leaf Is grievous and suggesteth grief: Who thought when Spring was fresh unfurled Of this? when Spring twigs gleamed impearled Who thought of frost that nips the world? There are a hundred subtle stings To prick us in our daily walk: A young fruit cankered on its stalk, A strong bird snared for all his wings, A nest that sang but never sings; Yea sight and sound and silence stings. There is a lack in solitude, There is a load in throng of life; One with another genders strife, To be alone yet is not good: I know but of one neighbourhood At peace and full; death's solitude. Sleep soundly, dears, who lulled at last Forget the bird and all her pains, Forget the moon that waxes, wanes, The leaf, the sting, the frostful blast; Forget the troublous years that past In strife or ache did end at last. We have clear call of daily bells, A dimness where the anthems are, A chancel vault of sky and star, A thunder if the organ swells: Alas our daily life—what else?— Is not in tune with daily bells. You have deep pause betwixt the chimes Of earth and heaven, a patient pause Yet glad with rest by certain laws: You look and long; while oftentimes Precursive flush of morning climbs And air vibrates with coming chimes. “Only believe.” I stood by weeping Yet a sorrowful silence keeping While an Angel smote my love As she lay sleeping.— Is there a bed above More fragrant than these violets That are white like death? White like a dove Flowers in the blessed islets Breathe sweeter breath All fair morns and twilights. Is the gold there More golden than these tresses? There heads are aureoled And crowned like gold With light most rare. Are the bowers of Heaven More choice than these? To them are given All odorous shady trees. Earth's bowers are wildernesses Compared with the recesses Made soft there now Nest-like twixt bough and bough. Who shall live in such a nest? Heart with heart at rest: All they whose troubles cease In peace: Souls that wrestled Now are nestled There at ease: Throng from east and west From north and south To plenty from the land of drouth. How long must they wait? There is a certain term For their bodies to the worm And their souls at Heaven-gate. Dust to dust, clod to clod These precious things of God; Trampled underfoot by man And beast the appointed years. Their longest life was but a span For birth, death, laughter, tears: Is it worth while to live, Rejoice and grieve, Hope, fear and die? Man with man, lie with lie, The slow show dwindles by: At last what shall we have Besides a grave? Lies and shows no more, No fear, no pain, But after hope and sleep Dear joys again. Those who sowed shall reap: Those who bore The cross shall wear the crown: Those who clomb the steep There shall sit down. The Shepherd of the sheep Feeds His flock there; [The rest of the poem is missing from the notebook.] “Rivals.” A Shadow of Saint Dorothea. “Golden haired, lily white, “Will you pluck me lilies; “Or will you show me where they grow, “Show where the summer rill is? “But is your hair of gold or light, “And is your foot of flake or fire, “And have you wings rolled up from sight, “And joy to slake desire?”— “I pluck young flowers of Paradise, “Lilies and roses red; “A sceptre for my hand, “A crown to crown my golden head. “Love makes me wise: “I sing, I stand, “I pluck palm branches in the sheltered land.”— “Is there a path to Heaven “My heavy foot may tread; “And will you show that way to go, “That rose and lily bed? “Which day of all these seven “Will lighten my heart of lead, “Will purge mine eyes and make me wise “Alive or dead?”— “There is a Heavenward stair— “Mount, strain upwards, strain and strain— “Each step will crumble to your foot “That never shall descend again. “There grows a tree from ancient root, “With healing leaves and twelvefold fruit, “In musical Heaven air: “Feast with me there.”— “I have a home on earth I cannot leave, “I have a friend on earth I cannot grieve: “Come down to me, I cannot mount to you.”— “Nay choose between us both, “Choose as you are lief or loath: “You cannot keep these things and have me too.”— A Yawn. I grow so weary: is it death This awful woful weariness? It is a weight to heave my breath, A weight to wake, a weight to sleep; I have no heart to work or weep. The sunshine teazes and the dark; Only the twilight dulls my grief: Is this the Ark, the strong safe Ark, Or the tempestuous drowning sea Whose crested coursers foam for me? Why does the sea moan evermore? Shut out from Heaven it makes its moan, It frets against the boundary shore: All earth's full rivers cannot fill The sea, that drinking thirsteth still. Sheer miracles of loveliness Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed: Salt passionless anemones Blow flower-like; just enough alive To blow and propagate and thrive. Shells quaint with curve or spot or spike, Encrusted live things argus-eyed, All fair alike yet all unlike, Are born without a pang and die Without a pang and so pass by. I would I lived without a pang: Oh happy they who day by day Quiescent neither sobbed nor sang; Unburdened with a what or why They live and die and so pass by. For H. P. On the land and on the sea, Jesus keep both you and me: Going out and coming in, Christ keep us both from shame and sin: In this world, in the world to come, Keep us safe and lead us home: Today in toil, tonight in rest, Be Best Beloved and love us best. “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another.” Friend I commend to thee the narrow way: Not because I, please God, will walk therein, But rather for the love-feast of that day The exceeding prize which whoso will may win. This world is old and rotting at the core Here death's heads mock us with a toothless grin Here heartiest laughter leaves us spent and sore. We heap up treasures for the fretting moth, Our children heap our fathers heaped before, But what shall profit us the cumbrous growth? It cannot journey with us, cannot save, Stripped in that darkness be we lief or loth Stripped bare to what we are from all we have, Naked we came, naked we must return To one obscure inevitable grave. If this the lesson is which we must learn Taught by God's discipline of love or wrath (To brand or purify His fire must burn)— Friend I commend to theee the narrow path That thou and I, please God, may walk therein, May taste and see how good is God Who hath Loved us while hating even to death our sin. “What good shall my life do me?” No hope in life; yet is there hope In death, the threshold of man's scope: Man yearneth (as the heliotrope For ever seeks the sun) thro' light Thro' dark for Love: all read aright Is Love for Love is infinite. Shall not this infinite Love suffice To feed thy dearth? Lift heart and eyes Up to the hills, grow glad and wise. The hills are glad because the sun Kisses their round tops every one Where silver fountains laugh and run: Smooth pebbles shine beneath; beside The grass, mere green, grows myriad-eyed With pomp of blossoms veined or pied. So every nest is glad whereon The sun in tender strength has shone; So every fruit he glows upon; So every valley depth, whose herds At pasture praise him without words; So the winged extasies of birds. If there be any such thing, what Is there by sunlight betters not?— Nothing except dead things that rot. Thou then who art not dead and fit Like blasted tree beside the pit But for the axe that levels it, Living show life of Love, whereof The force wields earth and heaven above: Who knows not Love begetteth Love?— Love in the gracious rain distils; Love moves the subtle fountain rills To fertilize uplifted hills And seedful vallies fertilize; Love stills the hungry lion's cries And the young raven satisfies; Love hangs this earth in space; Love rolls Fair worlds rejoicing on their poles And girds them round with aureoles; Love lights the sun; Love thro' the dark Lights the moon's evanescent arc; Same Love lights up the glow-worm's spark; Love rears the great; Love tends the small; Breaks off the yoke, breaks down the wall; Accepteth all, fulfilleth all. O ye who taste that Love is sweet, Set waymarks for the doubtful feet That stumble on in search of it. Sing hymns of Love, that those who hear Far off in pain may lend an ear Rise up and wonder and draw near. Lead lives of Love, that others who Behold your lives may kindle too With Love and cast their lots with you. The Massacre of Perugia. A trumpet pealed thro' France. Then Italy Stirred, shook, from sea to sea. Then many cities broke Their lawful yoke. Then in an evil hour Perugia on her fort-crowned hill [The rest of the poem is missing from the notebook.] [I have done with hope] I have done with hope; Have done with lies from sea to sea: How should I lie beneath the cope Of Heaven's star-blazoned verity? I will not wear your crown tonight, But mine own crown tomorrow morn: [The lines of the poem preceding and following the above are missing from the notebook.] Promises like Piecrust. Promise me no promises, So will I not promise you; Keep we both our liberties, Never false and never true: Let us hold the die uncast, Free to come as free to go; For I cannot know your past, And of mine what can you know? You, so warm, may once have been Warmer towards another one; I, so cold, may once have seen Sunlight, once have felt the sun: Who shall show us if it was Thus indeed in time of old? Fades the image from the glass And the fortune is not told. If you promised, you might grieve For lost liberty again; If I promised, I believe I should fret to break the chain: Let us be the friends we were, Nothing more but nothing less; Many thrive on frugal fare Who would perish of excess. By the waters of Babylon. By the waters of Babylon We sit down and weep, Far from the pleasant land Where our fathers sleep; Far from our Holy Place From which the Glory is gone; We sit in dust and weep By the waters of Babylon. By the waters of Babylon The willow trees grow rank: We hang our harps thereon Silent upon the bank. Before us the days are dark, And dark the days that are gone; We grope in the very dark By the waters of Babylon. By the waters of Babylon We thirst for Jordan yet, We pine for Jerusalem Whereon our hearts are set: Our priests defiled and slain, Our princes ashamed and gone, Oh how should we forget By the waters of Babylon? By the waters of Babylon Tho' the wicked grind the just, Our seed shall yet strike root And shall shoot up from the dust: The captive shall lead captive, The slave rise up and begone, And thou too shalt sit in dust O daughter of Babylon. Better so. Fast asleep, mine own familiar friend, Fast asleep at last: Tho' the pain was strong, Tho' the struggle long, It is past; All thy pangs are at an end. Whilst I weep, whilst death bells toll, Thou art fast asleep, With idle hands upon thy breast And heart at rest: Whilst I weep Angels sing around thy singing soul. Who would wish thee back upon the rough Wearisome dangerous road? Wish back thy toil-spent soul Just at the goal? My soul, praise God For one dear soul which hath enough. I would not fetch thee back to hope with me A sickening hope deferred, To taste the cup that slips From thirsty lips: Hast thou not heard What was to hear, and seen what was to see? I would not speak the word if I could raise My dead to life: I would not speak If I could flush thy cheek And rouse thy pulses' strife And send thy feet on the once-trodden ways. How could I meet the dear rebuke If thou should'st say: “O friend of little faith, Good was my lot of death, And good my day Of rest, and good the sleep I took”—? Our widowed Queen. The Husband of the widow care for her, The Father of the fatherless: The faithful Friend, the abiding Comforter, Watch over her to bless. Full twenty years of blameless married faith, Of love and honour questioned not, Joys, griefs imparted: for the first time Death Sunders the common lot. Christ help the desolate Queen upon her throne, Strengthen her hands, confirm her heart: For she henceforth must bear a load alone Borne until now in part. Christ help the desolate Woman in her home, Broken of heart, indeed bereft; Shrinking from solitary days to come, Beggared tho' much is left. Rise up, O Sons and Daughters of the Dead, Weep with your Mother where she weeps; Yet not as sorrowing without hope be shed Your tears: he only sleeps. Rise up, O Sons and Daughters of the realm, In pale reflected sorrow move; Revere the widowed hand that holds the helm, Love her with double love. In royal patience of her soul possess'd May she fulfill her length of days: Then may her children rise and call her bless'd, Then may her husband praise. In progress. Ten years ago it seemed impossible That she should ever grow so calm as this, With self-remembrance in her warmest kiss And dim dried eyes like an exhausted well. Slow-speaking when she has some fact to tell, Silent with long-unbroken silences, Centred in self yet not unpleased to please, Gravely monotonous like a passing bell. Mindful of drudging daily common things, Patient at pastime, patient at her work, Wearied perhaps but strenuous certainly. Sometimes I fancy we may one day see Her head shoot forth seven stars from where they lurk And her eyes lightnings and her shoulders wings. “Out of the deep.” Have mercy, Thou my God; mercy, my God; For I can hardly bear life day by day: Be I here or there I fret myself away: Lo for Thy staff I have but felt Thy rod Along this tedious desert path long trod. When will Thy judgement judge me, Yea or Nay? I pray for grace; but then my sins unpray My prayer: on holy ground I fool stand shod. While still Thou haunts't me, faint upon the cross, A sorrow beyond sorrow in Thy look, Unutterable craving for my soul. All faithful Thou, Lord: I, not Thou, forsook Myself; I traitor slunk back from the goal: Lord, I repent; help Thou my helpless loss. For a Mercy received. Thank God Who spared me what I feared! Once more I gird myself to run. Thy promise stands, Thou Faithful One. Horror of darkness disappeared At length; once more I see the sun, And dare to wait in hope for Spring, To face and bear the Winter's cold: The dead cocoon shall yet unfold And give to light the living wing; There's hidden sap beneath the mould. My God, how could my courage flag So long as Thou art still the same? For what were labour, failure, shame, Whilst Thy sure promise doth not lag And Thou dost shield me with Thy Name? Yet am I weak, my faith is weak, My heart is weak that pleads with Thee: O Thou That art not far to seek Turn to me, hearken when I speak, Stretch forth Thy Hand to succour me. Thro' many perils have I pass'd, Deaths, plagues, and wonders, have I seen: Till now Thy Hand hath held me fast: Lord help me, hold me, to the last; Still be what Thou hast always been. Open Thy Heart of Love to me, Give me Thyself, keep nothing back Even as I give myself to Thee. Love paid by Love doth nothing lack, And Love to pay Love is not slack. Love doth so grace and dignify That beggars sue as King with King Before the Throne of Grace on high: My God, be gracious to my cry; My God, accept what gift I bring: A heart that loves; tho' soiled and bruised, Yet chosen by Thee in time of yore: Who ever came and was refused By Thee? Do, Lord, as Thou art used To do, and make me love Thee more. Summer. Come, cuckoo, come; Come again, swift swallow; Come and welcome; where you come Summer's sure to follow. June, the month of months, Flowers and fruitage brings too; When green trees spread shadiest boughs, When each wild bird sings too. May is scant and crude, Generous June is riper; Birds fall silent in July, June has its woodland piper: Rocks upon the maple-top Homely-hearted linnet, Full in hearing of his nest And the dear ones in it. If the year would stand Still at June for ever, With no further growth on land Nor further flow of river, If all nights were shortest nights And longest days were all the seven,— This might be a merrier world To my mind to live in. A Dumb Friend. I planted a young tree when I was young; But now the tree is grown and I am old: There wintry robin shelters from the cold And tunes his silver tongue. A green and living tree I planted it, A glossy-foliaged tree of evergreen: All thro' the noontide heat it spread a screen Whereunder I might sit. But now I only watch it where it towers: I, sitting at my window, watch it tossed By rattling gale, or silvered by the frost; Or, when sweet summer flowers, Wagging its round green head with stately grace In tender winds that kiss it and go by: It shows a green full age; and what show I? A faded wrinkled face. So often have I watched it, till mine eyes Have filled with tears and I have ceased to see; That now it seems a very friend to me In all my secrets wise. A faithful pleasant friend, who year by year Grew with my growth and strengthened with my strength, But whose green lifetime shows a longer length: When I shall not sit here It still will bud in spring, and shed rare leaves In autumn, and in summer heat give shade, And warmth in winter; when my bed is made In shade the cypress weaves. Margery. What shall we do with Margery? She lies and cries upon her bed, All lily-pale from foot to head, Her heart is sore as sore can be; Poor guileless shamefaced Margery. A foolish girl, to love a man And let him know she loved him so! She should have tried a different plan; Have loved, but not have let him know: Then he perhaps had loved her so. What can we do with Margery Who has no relish for her food? We'd take her with us to the sea— Across the sea—but where's the good? She'd fret alike on land and sea. Yes, what the neighbours say is true: Girls should not make themselves so cheap. But now it's done what can we do? I hear her moaning in her sleep, Moaning and sobbing in her sleep. I think—and I'm of flesh and blood— Were I that man for whom she cares I would not cost her tears and prayers To leave her just alone like mud, Fretting her simple heart with cares. A year ago she was a child, Now she's a woman in her grief; The year's now at the falling leaf, At budding of the leaves she smiled; Poor foolish harmless foolish child. It was her own fault? so it was. If every own fault found us out Dogged us and snared us round about, What comfort should we take because Not half our due we thus wrung out? At any rate the question stands: What now to do with Margery, A weak poor creature on our hands? Something we must do: I'll not see Her blossom fade, sweet Margery. Perhaps a change may after all Prove best for her: to leave behind Those home-sights seen time out of mind; To get beyond the narrow wall Of home, and learn home is not all. Perhaps this way she may forget, Not all at once, but in a while; May come to wonder how she set Her heart on this slight thing, and smile At her own folly, in a while. Yet this I say and I maintain: Were I the man she's fretting for I should my very self abhor If I could leave her to her pain, Uncomforted to tears and pain. In Patience. I will not faint, but trust in God Who this my lot hath given; He leads me by the thorny road Which is the road to heaven. Tho' sad my day that lasts so long, At evening I shall have a song; Tho' dim my day until the night, At evening time there shall be light. My life is but a working day Whose tasks are set aright: A while to work, a while to pray, And then a quiet night. And then, please God, a quiet night Where Saints and Angels walk in white: One dreamless sleep from work and sorrow, But re-awakening on the morrow. Sunshine. “There's little sunshine in my heart Slack to spring, lead to sink; There's little sunshine in the world I think.”— “There's glow of sunshine in my heart (Cool wind, cool the glow); There's flood of sunshine in the world I know.”— Now if of these one spoke the truth, One spoke more or less: But which was which I will not tell;— You, guess. Meeting. If we shall live, we live; If we shall die, we die; If we live, we shall meet again; But tonight, good bye. One word, let but one be heard— What, not one word? If we sleep, we shall wake again And see tomorrow's light; If we wake, we shall meet again; But tonight, good night. Good night, my lost and found— Still not a sound? If we live, we must part; If we die, we part in pain; If we die, we shall part Only to meet again. By those tears on either cheek, Tomorrow you will speak. To meet, worth living for; Worth dying for, to meet; To meet, worth parting for; Bitter forgot in sweet. To meet, worth parting before Never to part more. “None with Him.” My God, to live: how didst Thou bear to live Preaching and teaching, toiling to and fro; Few men accepting what Thou hadst to give, Few men prepared to know Thy Face, to see the truth Thou camest to show? My God, to die: how didst Thou bear to die That long slow death in weariness of pain; A curse and an astonishment, passed by, Pointed at, mocked again, By men for whom Thy Blood was shed in vain? Whilst I do hardly bear my easy life, And hardly face my easy-coming death: I turn to flee before the tug of strife; And shrink with troubled breath From sleep, that is not death Thy Spirit saith. Under Willows. Under willows among the graves One was walking, ah welladay! Where each willow her green boughs waves Come April prime, come May. Under willows among the graves She met her lost love, ah welladay! Where in Autumn each wild wind raves And whirls sere leaves away. He looked at her with a smile, She looked at him with a sigh, Both paused to look awhile; Then he passed by, Passed by and whistled a tune; She stood silent and still: It was the sunniest day in June, Yet one felt a chill. Under willows among the graves I know a certain black black pool Scarce wrinkled when Autumn raves; Under the turf is cool; Under the water it must be cold; Winter comes cold when Summer's past; Though she live to be old, so old, She shall die at last. A Sketch. The blindest buzzard that I know Does not wear wings to spread and stir, Nor does my special mole wear fur And grub among the roots below; He sports a tail indeed, but then It's to a coat; he's man with men; His quill is cut to a pen. In other points our friend's a mole, A buzzard, beyond scope of speech: He sees not what's within his reach, Misreads the part, ignores the whole. Misreads the part so reads in vain, Ignores the whole tho' patent plain, Misreads both parts again. My blindest buzzard that I know, My special mole, when will you see? Oh no, you must not look at me, There's nothing hid for me to show. I might show facts as plain as day; But since your eyes are blind, you'd say: Where? What? and turn away. If I had Words. If I had words, if I had words At least to vent my misery:— But muter than the speechless herds I have no voice wherewith to cry. I have no strength to life my hands, I have no heart to lift mine eye, My soul is bound with brazen bands, My soul is crushed and like to die. My thoughts that wander here and there, That wander wander listlessly, Bring nothing back to cheer my care, Nothing that I may live thereby. My heart is broken in my breast, My breath is but a broken sigh— Oh if there be a land of rest It is far off, it is not nigh. If I had wings as hath a dove, If I had wings that I might fly, I yet would seek the land of love Where fountains run which run not dry; Tho' there be none that road to tell, And long that road is verily: Then if I lived I should do well, And if I died I should but die. If I had wings as hath a dove I would not sift the what and why, I would make haste to find out love, If not to find at least to try. I would make haste to love, my rest; To love, my truth that doth not lie: Then if I lived it might be best, Or if I died I could but die. What to do? Oh my love and my own own deary! What shall I do? my love is weary. Sleep, O friend, on soft downy pillow, Pass, O friend, as wind or as billow, And I'll wear the willow. No stone at his head be set, A swelling turf be his coverlet Bound round with a graveyard wattle; Hedged round from the trampling cattle And the children's prattle. I myself, instead of a stone, Will sit by him to dwindle and moan; Sit and weep with a bitter weeping, Sit and weep where my love lies sleeping While my life goes creeping. Young Death. Lying adying— Such sweet things untasted, Such rare beauties wasted: Her hair a hidden treasure, Her voice a lost pleasure; Her soul made void of passion; Her body going to nothing Though long it took to fashion, Soon to be a loathing: Her road hath no turning, Her light is burning burning With last feeble flashes; Dying from the birth: Dust to dust, earth to earth, Ashes to ashes. Lying adying— Have done with vain sighing: Life not lost but treasured, God Almighty pleasured, God's daughter fetched and carried, Christ's bride betrothed and married. Lo, in the Room, the Upper, She shall sit down to supper, New bathed from head to feet And on Christ gazing; Her mouth kept clean and sweet Shall laugh and sing, God praising: Then shall be no more weeping, Or fear, or sorrow, Or waking more, or sleeping, Or night, or morrow, Or cadence in the song Of songs, or thirst, or hunger; The strong shall rise more strong And the young younger. Our tender little dove Meek-eyed and simple, Our love goes home to Love; There shall she walk in white Where God shall be the Light And God the Temple. In a certain place. I found Love in a certain place Asleep and cold—or cold and dead?— All ivory-white upon his bed All ivory-white his face. His hands were folded On his quiet breast, To his figure laid at rest Chilly bed was moulded. His hair hung lax about his brow, I had not seen his face before; Or if I saw it once, it wore Another aspect now. No trace of last night's sorrow, No shadow of tomorrow; All at peace (thus all sorrows cease), All at peace. I wondered: Were his eyes Soft or falcon-clear? I wondered: As he lies Does he feel me near? In silence my heart spoke And wondered: If he woke And found me sitting nigh him And felt me sitting by him, If life flushed to his cheek, He living man with men, Then if I heard him speak Oh should I know him then? “Cannot sweeten.” If that's water you wash your hands in Why is it black as ink is black?— Because my hands are foul with my folly: Oh the lost time that comes not back!— If that's water you bathe your feet in Why is it red as wine is red?— Because my feet sought blood in their goings; Red red is the track they tread.— Slew you mother or slew you father That your foulness passeth not by?— Not father and oh not mother: I slew my love with an evil eye.— Slew you sister or slew you brother That in peace you have not a part?— Not brother and oh not sister: I slew my love with a hardened heart. He loved me because he loved me, Not for grace or beauty I had; He loved me because he loved me; For his loving me I was glad. Yet I loved him not for his loving While I played with his love and truth, Not loving him for his loving, Wasting his joy, wasting his youth. I ate his life as a banquet, I drank his life as new wine, I fattened upon his leanness, Mine to flourish and his to pine. So his life fled as running water, So it perished as water spilt: If black my hands and my feet as scarlet, Blacker redder my heart of guilt. Cold as a stone, as hard, as heavy; All my sighs ease it no whit, All my tears make it no cleaner Dropping dropping dropping on it. Of my life. I weary of my life Thro' the long sultry day, While happy creatures play Their harmless lives away:— What is my life? I weary of my life Thro' the slow tedious night, While earth and heaven's delight The moon walks forth in white:— What is my life? If I might I would die; My soul should flee away To day that is not day Where sweet souls sing and say.— If I might die! If I might I would die; My body out of sight, All night that is not night My soul should walk in white— If I might die! [Yes, I too could face death and never shrink] Yes, I too could face death and never shrink: But it is harder to bear hated life; To stive with hands and knees weary of strife; To drag the heavy chain whose every link Galls to the bone; to stand upon the brink Of the deep grave, nor drowse, though it be rife With sleep; to hold with steady hand the knife Nor strike home: this is courage as I think. Surely to suffer is more than to do: To do is quickly done; to suffer is Longer and fuller of heart-sicknesses: Each day's experience testifies of this: Good deeds are many, but good lives are few; Thousands taste the full cup; who drains the lees?— [Would that I were a turnip white] Would that I were a turnip white, Or raven black, Or miserable hack Dragging a cab from left to right; Or would I were the showman of a sight, Or weary donkey with a laden back, Or racer in a sack, Or freezing traveller on an Alpine height; Or would I were straw catching as I drown, (A wretched landsman I who cannot swim,) Or watching a lone vessel sink, Rather than writing: I would change my pink Gauze for a hideous yellow satin gown With deep-cut scolloped edges and a rim. [I fancy the good fairies dressed in white] I fancy the good fairies dressed in white, Glancing like moon-beams through the shadows black; Without much work to do for king or hack. Training perhaps some twisted branch aright; Or sweeping faded Autumn leaves from sight To foster embryo life; or binding back Stray tendrils; or in ample bean-pod sack Bringing wild honey from the rocky height; Or fishing for a fly lest it should drown; Or teaching water-lily heads to swim, Fearful that sudden rain might make them sink; Or dyeing the pale rose a warmer pink; Or wrapping lilies in their leafy gown, Yet letting the white peep beyond the rim.— [Some ladies dress in muslin full and white] Some ladies dress in muslin full and white, Some gentlemen in cloth succinct and black; Some patronise a dog-cart, some a hack, Some think a painted clarence only right. Youth is not always such a pleasing sight, Witness a man with tassels on his back; Or woman in a great-coat like a sack Towering above her sex with horrid height. If all the world were water fit to drown There are some whom you would not teach to swim, Rather enjoying if you saw them sink; Certain old ladies dressed in girlish pink, With roses and geraniums on their gown:— Go to the Bason, poke them o'er the rim.— Autumn. Fade tender lily, Fade O crimson rose, Fade every flower Sweetest flower that blows. Go chilly Autumn, Come O Winter cold; Let the green things die away Into common mould. Birth follows hard on death, Life on withering: Hasten, we shall come the sooner Back to pleasant Spring. By way of Remembrance. [Remember, if I claim too much of you] Remember, if I claim too much of you, I claim it of my brother and my friend: Have patience with me till the hidden end, Bitter or sweet, in mercy shut from view. Pay me my due; though I to pay your due Am all too poor and past what will can mend: Thus of your bounty you must give and lend Still unrepaid by aught I look to do. Still unrepaid by aught of mine on earth: But overpaid, please God, when recompense Beyond the mystic Jordan and new birth Is dealt to virtue as to innocence; When Angels singing praises in their mirth Have borne you in their arms and fetched you hence. [Will you be there? my yearning heart has cried] Will you be there? my yearning heart has cried: Ah me, my love, my love, shall I be there, To sit down in your glory and to share Your gladness, glowing as a virgin bride? Or will another dearer, fairer-eyed, Sit nigher to you in your jubilee; And mindful one of other will you be Borne higher and higher on joy's ebbless tide? —Yea, if I love I will not grudge you this: I too shall float upon that heavenly sea And sing my joyful praises without ache; Your overflow of joy shall gladden me, My whole heart shall sing praises for your sake And find its own fulfilment in your bliss. [In resurrection is it awfuller] In resurrection is it awfuller That rising of the All or of the Each: Of all kins of all nations of all speech, Or one by one of him and him and her? When dust reanimate begins to stir Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach; While every wave disgorges on its beach Alive or dead-in-life some seafarer. In resurrection, on the day of days, That day of mourning throughout all the earth, In resurrection may we meet again: No more with stricken hearts to part in twain; As once in sorrow one, now one in mirth, One in our resurrection songs of praise. [I love you and you know it—this at least] I love you and you know it—this at least, This comfort is mine own in all my pain: You know it and can never doubt again, And love's mere self is a continual feast. Not oath of mine nor blessing-word of priest Could make my love more certain or more plain:— Life as a rolling moon doth wax and wane O weary moon, still rounding, still decreased! Life wanes: and when love folds his wings above Tired joy, and less we feel his conscious pulse, Let us go fall asleep, dear Friend, in peace;— A little while, and age and sorrow cease; A little while, and love reborn annuls Loss and decay and death—and all is love. Valentines from C.G.R. [Fairer than younger beauties, more beloved] Fairer than younger beauties, more beloved Than many a wife,— By stress of Time's vicissitudes unmoved From settled calm of life,— Endearing rectitude to those who watch The verdict of your face, Raising &amp; making gracious those who catch A semblance of your grace:— With kindly lips of welcome, &amp; with pleased Propitious eyes benign, Accept a kiss of homage from your least Last Valentine. A Valentine, 1877. Own Mother dear, We all rejoicing here Wait for each other, Daughter for Mother, Sister for Brother, Till each dear face appear Transfigured by Love's flame Yet still the same,— The same yet new,— My face to you, Your face to me, Made lovelier by Love's flame But still the same; Most dear to see In halo of Love's flame, Because the same. 1878. Blessed Dear &amp; heart's Delight, Companion, Friend, &amp; Mother mine Round whom my fears &amp; love entwine,— With whom I hope to stand &amp; sing Where Angels form the outer ring Round singing Saints who, clad in white, Know no more of day or night Or death or any changeful thing, Or anything that is not love, Human love &amp; love Divine,— Bid me to that tryst above, Bless your Valentine. 1879. Mother mine Whom every year Doth endear, Before sweet Spring (That sweetest thing Brimfull of bliss) Sets all the throng Of birds a-wooing Billing &amp; cooing,— Your Valentine Sings you a song, Gives you a kiss. 1880. More shower than shine Brings sweet St. Valentine; Warm shine, warm shower, Bring up sweet flower on flower: Thro' shower &amp; shine Loves you your Valentine, Thro' shine, thro' shower, Thro' summer's flush, thro' Autumn's fading hour. St. Valentine's Day 1881. Too cold almost for hope of Spring Or firstfruits from the realm of flowers, Your dauntless Valentine, I bring One sprig of love, and sing “Love has no Winter hours”.— If even in this world love is love (This wintry world which felt the Fall), What must it be in Heaven above Where love to great and small Is all in all? A Valentine 1882. My blessed Mother dozing in her chair On Christmas Day seemed an embodied Love, A comfortable Love with soft brown hair Softened and silvered to a tint of dove, A better sort of Venus with an air Angelical from thoughts that dwell above, A wiser Pallas in whose body fair Enshrined a blessed soul looks out thereof. Winter brought Holly then; now Spring has brought Paler and frailer Snowdrops shivering; And I have brought a simple humble thought —I her devoted duteous Valentine—, A lifelong thought which thrills this song I sing, A lifelong love to this dear Saint of mine. February 14. 1883. A world of change &amp; loss, a world of death, Of heart &amp; eyes that fail, of labouring breath, Of pains to bear &amp; painful deeds to do:— Nevertheless a world of life to come And love; where you're at home, while in our home Your Valentine rejoices having you. 1884. Another year of joy &amp; grief, Another year of hope &amp; fear: O Mother, is life long or brief? We hasten while we linger here. But since we linger, love me still And bless me still, O Mother mine, While hand in hand we scale life's hill, You Guide, &amp; I your Valentine. 1885. St. Valentine's Day. All the Robin Redbreasts Have lived the winter thro', Jenny Wrens have pecked their fill And found a work to do, Families of Sparrows Have weathered wind &amp; storm With Rabbit on the stony hill And Hare upon her form. You &amp; I, my Mother, Have lived the winter thro', And still we play our daily parts And still find work to do: And still the cornfields flourish, The olive &amp; the vine, And still you reign my Queen of Hearts And I'm your Valentine. 1886 St. Valentine's Day. Winter's latest snowflake is the snowdrop flower, Yellow crocus kindles the first flame of the Spring, At that time appointed, at that day and hour When life reawakens and hope in everything. Such a tender snowflake in the wintry weather, Such a feeble flamelet for chilled St. Valentine,— But blest be any weather which finds us still together, My pleasure and my treasure O blessed Mother mine. [Ah welladay and wherefore am I here?] Ah welladay and wherefore am I here? I sit alone all day I sit &amp; think— I watch the sun arise, I watch it sink And feel no soul-light tho the day is clear Surely it is a folly; it is mere Madness to stand for ever on the brink Of dark despair &amp; yet not break the link That makes me scorned who cannot be held dear. I will have done with it; I will not stand And fear on without hope &amp; tremble thus Look for the break of day &amp; miss it ever Although my heart be broken they shall never Say: She was glad to sojourn among us Thankful if one would take her by the hand. [Along the highroad the way is too long] Along the highroad the way is too long Let us walk where the oak trees rise up thick I take a crab-, you take a cherry stick Let us go from among men to the throng Of belted bees: the wild roses smell strong And sweet; &amp; my old dog is fain to lick My hand: best so in good truth I am sick Of the world; &amp; hear silence as a song And you I think are changed friend you who once Would dance thro' the long night; a something called From your heart; into your hid brain it sunk; Oh listen silence maketh the air drunk I would not give these shades that have not palled On me, for the broad light of many suns. [And is this August weather? nay not so] And is this August weather? nay not so With the long rain the cornfield waxeth dark. How the cold rain comes pouring down &amp; hark To the chill wind whose measured pace &amp; slow Seems still to linger being loth to go. I cannot stand beside the sea and mark Its grandeur; it's too wet for that: no lark In this drear season cares to sing or show. And since its name is August all men find Fire not allowable; Winter foregone Had more of sunlight &amp; of glad warmth more I shall be fain to run upon the shore And mark the rain. Hath the sun ever shone Cheer up there can be nothing worse to mind. [From early dawn until the flush of noon] From early dawn until the flush of noon And from hot noon unto the hushèd night I look around beholding all things bright From the deep sun unto the silver moon My heart &amp; soul &amp; spirit are in tune. My sense is gladdened with an inward light. The very clouds above my head are white And glorious radiance shall disperse them soon. All trees &amp; bushes fruits &amp; flowers bear, The sea is full of life &amp; beauty, how The grand waves leap up—as tho' full of sense, A better day was not I think &amp; ne'er Was I so full of joy as I am now. Surely a chill shall come &amp; this go hence [I seek among the living &amp; I seek] I seek among the living &amp; I seek Among the dead for some to love; but few I find at last &amp; these have quite run through Their store of love &amp; friendship is too weak And cold for me; yet will I never speak Telling my heart want to cold listeners who Will wonder smiling; I can bear &amp; do No tears shall sully my unfurrowed cheek So when my dust shall mix with other dust When I shall have found quiet in decay And lie at ease &amp; cease to be &amp; rot Those whom I love thinking of me shall not Grieve with a measure, saying: Now we must Weep for a little ere we go &amp; play. [O glorious sea that in each climbing wave] O glorious sea that in each climbing wave Bearest great thoughts as in a wondrous book The ends of earth oft at thy presence shook And not denied when thou hast stooped to crave. Sometimes the mighty winds have dared to brave Thy potency; but with a single look Raising thy head forth from its ancient nook Thou hast recalled the quiet thou wouldst have. What is a ship save many a fragile stick? How should it brave thy terrors when they wear The lightning crest that maketh substance wither Yea though the planks be seasoned well &amp; thick Thine anger is too hard a thing to bear:— Thou sayest to men: go back &amp; come not hither. [Oh thou who tell'st me that all hope is over] Oh thou who tell'st me that all hope is over With lazy limbs that heavily recline On the soft cushions; flushed &amp; fair with wine Scarce seeming conscious of the scents that hover Round &amp; above thee: can thy heart recover So soon its quiet, while mine own shall pine? Thou who canst love &amp; not o'erstep the line Of comfort, art thou in good truth a lover O take away from me those chill calm glances As thou hast ta'en thy heart away; &amp; give My heart again that must forget to wander Thy words were worse than silence they were lances To poison all the life I have to live Stagnate the streams of life that should meander [Surely there is an aching void within] Surely there is an aching void within Man's spirit unto other men unknown And which were it unveiled and freely shown Would open to the sight so much of sin And folly &amp; a cry that at the din His overbearing pride &amp; overblown Would quite shrink down &amp; seem as it had grown Humble, content to lose &amp; not to win. Oh that we so could hide the grief of years From our own selves yea the whole guilt &amp; trouble And in our secret spirit look on grace; Yet death for ever sendeth messengers Before it conscience pricks, &amp; were these double They were not equal to our sin-stained face. [The spring is come again not as at first] The spring is come again not as at first For then it was my spring; &amp; now a brood Of bitter memories haunt me, &amp; my mood Is much changed from the time when I was nursed In the still country. Oh! my heart could burst Thinking upon the long ago: the crude Hopes all unrealised; the flowers that strewed My path, now changed to painful thorns &amp; curst. And though I know the kingcups are as fine As they were then, my spirit cannot soar As it did once: when shadows of a wood Or thinking of a blossom that soon should Unfold &amp; fill the air with scent, would pour Peace on my brow now marked with many a line. [Who shall my wandering thoughts steady &amp; fix] Who shall my wandering thoughts steady &amp; fix When I go forth into the world and gaze Around me, thinking on mens evil ways I wonder in myself to see how mix Evil &amp; good; beyond the Sleepy Styx All things shall be unravelled whoso lays These things to heart after the settled days Shall know all. Even as a dog that licks Your hand whom tears chide not away nor laughter So to your souls clingeth the taint of crime Shall it be ever so? &amp; if not why? The river bed is full of filthy slime And so our heart is lined with wonder: die And having died thou shalt see all things after. [You who look on passed ages as a glass] You who look on passed ages as a glass To shadow forth the future, in your home Peacefully dwelling little heeding some But loving many; as the visions pass Turn from them for a moment to the grass And solemn sun &amp; blue o'erarching dome And in the hush of nature think on Rome Not as it is now but as it once was. As of the mighty dead think without hope But if you will indulge a hopeful pile Yea if you will write about it in rhyme For if it once had a too mighty scope To be all as the sun fails not to smile It shall be nothing to the end of time. The Succession of Kings. William the Norman was brave in the field; And Rufus, his Son, in the chase was killed. Henry the first early lost his dear Son; And Stephen's battles were bravely won. Henry the second his kingdom increased. Richard the first led Crusades in the East. John signed Magna Charta at Runnymede. Henry the third put his seal to the deed. Brave Edward the first the Welsh did subdue. Weak Edward the second had foes not a few. Edward the third to France did aspire, Whose Son, the Black Prince, died before his Sire. Richard the second to weakness was prone; And Henry the fourth was placed on his throne. Fifth Henry at Agincourt won the field. Meek Henry the sixth was forced to yield, To Edward the fourth who abused his power. Edward the fifth found a grave in the Tower. Richard the third was a treacherous friend; By Henry the seventh he came to his end. Henry the eighth had six wives in succession. Edward the sixth was the hope of the nation; For ten days reigned his Cousin the Lady Jane. Queen Mary espoused King Philip of Spain. A reign glorious and long was Elizabeth's lot. James the first shrewdly guessed at the Gunpowder Plot. Charles the first on a scaffold lost his head; The Protector Cromwell ruled in his stead. Richard Cromwell from ruling with joy did retire. Charles the second beheld both the Plague and Fire. For his faith James the second the crown did lose; Which third William and Mary did not refuse. Marlborough fought under good Queen Anne. The Hanover Line with first George began. Second George overcame the second Pretender. In the reign of third George did Napoleon surrender. George the fourth was long Regent, but King at last. Under William the fourth the Reform Bill passed. Good Queen Victoria, the last King's Niece, Reigns over England beloved and at peace. A true Story. (continued.) In this great city now the haunt, Of priest and friar and monk Where reason sees her ill-starr'd bark, By superstition sunk; Where nature's voice by force repress'd, Its energy declares, In demon deeds of wickedness, When fear its dagger bares; In Rome itself there lately dwelt Two sister-maidens fair, Affianced both to noble youths, Of form and virtue rare. Preparing now for that great step, Of weal or woe the seal, Before they joyful give their hands, Where purest love they feel; (To be continued) [The two Rossettis (brothers they)] The two Rossettis (brothers they) And Holman Hunt and John Millais, With Stephens chivalrous and bland, And Woolner in a distant land, In these six men I awestruck see Embodied the great P.R.B. D. G. Rossetti offered two Good pictures to the public view: Unnumbered ones great John Millais, And Holman more than I can say William Rossetti calm and solemn Cuts up his brethren by the column. Imitated from the Arpa Evangelica: Page 121. My Lord, my Love! in pleasant pain How often have I said: Blessed that John, who on Thy Breast Laid down his head. It was that contact all Divine Transformed him from above, And made him amongst men the man To show forth holy love. Yet shall I envy blessed John? Nay, not so verily, Now that Thou, Lord, both Man &amp; God Dost dwell in me: Upbuilding with Thy Manhood's might My frail humanity; Yea, Thy Divinehood pouring forth In fulness filling me. Me, Lord, Thy temple consecrate, Even me to Thee alone; Lord reign upon my willing heart Which is Thy throne: To Thee the Seraphim fall down Adoring round Thy house; For which of them hath tasted Thee, My Manna &amp; my Spouse? Now that Thy Life lives in my soul And sways &amp; warms it thro', I scarce seem lesser than the world, Thy temple too. O God Who dwellest in my heart, My God Who fillest me, The broad immensity itself Hath not encompassed Thee. “T'amo; e fra dolci affanni”—. p. 121.— My Lord, my Love!—in love's unrest How often have I said: “Blessed that John who on Thy Breast Reclined his head.” Thy touch it was, Love's Pelican, Transformed him from above, And made him amongst men the man To show forth holy love! Yet shall I envy blessèd John? Nay, not so verily, While Thou indwellest as Thine own Me, even me: Upbuilding with Thy Manhood's worth My frail humanity; Yea, Thy Divinehood pouring forth, In fulness filling me. Me, Lord, Thy temple consecrate, Me unto Thee alone; Within my heart set up Thy state And mount Thy throne: The Seraphim in ecstasy Fall prone around Thy house, For which of them hath tasted Thee My Manna and my Spouse? Now Thou dost wear me for a robe And sway and warm me thro', I scarce seem lesser than the globe,— Thy temple too: O God Who for Thy dwelling place Dost take delight in me, The ungirt immensity of space Hath not encompassed Thee. [Mr. and Mrs. Scott, and I] Mr. and Mrs. Scott, and I, With Mr. Manson, Editor, And of the social Proctors four, Agreed the season to defy. We mustered forces at the Rail, Struck hands and made our interests one: Alas for absent Annie Hayle Who should have shared the fare and fun. Not neighbour Humble and her child —Tho' well-disposed of doubtful force— But Annie Hayle my verse deplores, Behatted plump alert and mild. From Newcastle to Sunderland Upon a misty morn in June We took the train: on either hand Grimed streets were changed for meadows soon. Umbrellas, tarts and sandwiches Sustained our spirits' temperate flow, With potted jam, and cold as snow Rough-coated sun-burnt oranges. [Gone to his rest] 1 Gone to his rest Bright little Bouby! Build green his nest Where sun and dew be, Nor snails molest 2 A cheerful sage, Simple, light-hearted: In ripe old age He had departed And ta'en his wage. 3 Dear for himself; Dear for another Past price of pelf; —(Ah, dearest Mother!)— Song-singing elf. 4 O daisies, grow Lightly above him, Strike root, and blow: For some who love him Would have it so. [I said “All's over”—&amp; I made my] I said “All's over”—&amp; I made my Thenceforward to keep silence &amp; From any hope or enterprise aga But as one certain day the sap Sun warmed &amp; solaced in its f So something stirred in me th And all my hardness broke And hope once more tended [illegible fragment] [I said good bye in hope] I said good bye in hope: But now we meet again I have no hope at all Of anything but pain, Our parting &amp; our meeting Alike in vain. Hope on thro' all your life Until the end, dear Friend. Live thro' your noble life Where joy &amp; promise blend: I too will live my life Until the end. Long may your vine entwine, Long may your figtree spread Their paradise of shade Above your cherished head: My shelter was a gourd, And it is dead. Yet when out of a grave We are gathered home at last, Then may we own life spilt No good worth holding fast:— Death had its bitterness But it is past. My Mouse. A Venus seems my Mouse Come safe ashore from foaming seas, Which in a small way &amp; at ease Keeps house. An Iris seems my Mouse, Bright bow of that exhausted shower Which made a world of sweet-herbs flower And boughs. A darling Mouse it is:— Part hope not likely to take wing, Part memory, part anything You please. Venus-cum-Iris Mouse From shifting tides set safe apart, In no mere bottle, in my heart Keep house. [Had Fortune parted us] Had Fortune parted us Fortune is blind, Had Anger parted us Anger unkind— But since God parts us Let us part humbly Bearing our burden Bravely &amp; dumbly. And since there is but one Heaven, not another, Let us not close that door Against each other. God's Love is higher than mine, Christ's tenfold proved, Yet even I would die For thee Beloved. Counterblast on Penny Trumpet. “When raged the conflict, fierce &amp; hot.” If Mr. Bright retiring does not please And Mr. Gladstone staying gives offence, What can man do which is not one of these? Use your own common sense. Yet he's a brave man who abjures his cause For conscience' sake: let byegones be byegones: Not this among the makers of our laws The least &amp; and last of Johns. If all our byegones could be piled on shelves High out of reach of penny-line Tyrtaeus! If only all of us could see ourselves As others see us! [A roundel seems to fit a round of days] A roundel seems to fit a round of days Be they the days of upright man or scoundrel: Allow me to construct then in your praise A roundel. [This flower of wit turns out a weed like groundsel: Yet deign to welcome it, as loftiest bays Grown on the shore of Girvan's ocean groundswell.] Accept the love that underlies the lays; Condone the barbarous rhymes that will not sound well In building up, all Poets to amaze, A roundel. [Heaven overarches earth and sea] Heaven overarches earth and sea, Earth-sadness and sea-bitterness; Heaven overarches you and me: A little while, and we shall be (Please God) where there is no more sea Or barren wilderness. Heaven overarches you and me And all earth's gardens and her graves: Look up with me, until we see The day break and the shadows flee; What tho' tonight wrecks you and me, If so tomorrow saves? [Sleeping at last, the trouble &amp; tumult over] Sleeping at last, the trouble &amp; tumult over, Sleeping at last, the struggle &amp; horror past, Cold &amp; white out of sight of friend &amp; of lover Sleeping at last. No more a tired heart downcast or overcast, No more pangs that wring or shifting fears that hover, Sleeping at last in a dreamless sleep locked fast. Fast asleep. Singing birds in their leafy cover Cannot wake her, nor shake her the gusty blast. Under the purple thyme &amp; the purple clover Sleeping at last. 4?? May morning. My carrier pigeon is a “fancy” pigeon, Less tangible than widgeon; A sympathetic love,—yet not a Cupid, Nor pert nor stupid, Heart-warm &amp; snug tho' May Day deal in zeroes, A well-known Eros. On windless wings by flight untired for ever Outspeed the speeding river, From Torrington remote to utmost Chelsea (—Do what I tells ye!—) Carry a heart of love &amp; thanks &amp; blisses, A beak of kisses, Past Piccadilly's hills &amp; populous valleys, Past every human head that more or less is Begirt with tawny tresses, Past every house, to sumptuous Bellevue Palace; There greet the courteous Courtneys with politeness, And the dear Scotts with an affectionate brightness, And give a kiss to dark-locked Alice. THE CHINAMAN. ‘Centre of Earth!’ a Chinaman he said, And bent over a map his pig-tailed head,— That map in which, portrayed in colours bright, China, all dazzling, burst upon the sight: ‘Centre of Earth!’ repeatedly he cries, ‘Land of the brave, the beautiful, the wise!’ Thus he exclaimed; when lo his words arrested Showed what sharp agony his head had tested. He feels a tug—another, and another— And quick exclaims, ‘Hallo! what's now the bother?’ But soon alas perceives. And, ‘Why, false night, Why not from men shut out the hateful sight? The faithless English have cut off my tail, and left me my sad fortunes to bewail. Now in the streets I can no more appear, For all the other men a pig-tail wear.’ He said, and furious cast into the fire His tail: those flames became its funeral-pyre. [‘Come cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer!’] ‘Come cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer!’ As the soldier remarked whose post lay in the rear. THE PLAGUE “Listen, the last stroke of death's noon has struck— The plague is come,” a gnashing Madman said, And laid him down straightway upon his bed. His writhèd hands did at the linen pluck; Then all is over. With a careless chuck Among his fellows he is cast. How sped His spirit matters little: many dead Make men hard-hearted.—“Place him on the truck. Go forth into the burial-ground and find Room at so much a pitful for so many. One thing is to be done; one thing is clear: Keep thou back from the hot unwholesome wind, That it infect not thee.” Say, is there any Who mourneth for the multitude dead here? [How many authors are my first!] How many authors are my first! And I shall be so too Unless I finish speedily That which I have to do. My second is a lofty tree And a delicious fruit; This in the hot-house flourishes— That amid rocks takes root. My whole is an immortal queen Renowned in classic lore: Her a god won without her will, And her a goddess bore. [Me you often meet] Me you often meet In London's crowded street, And merry children's voices my resting-place proclaim. Pictures and prose and verse Compose me—I rehearse Evil and good and folly, and call each by its name. I make men glad, and I Can bid their senses fly, And festive echoes know me of Isis and of Cam. But give me to a friend, And amity will end, Though he may have the temper and meekness of a lamb. [So I began my walk of life; no stop] So I began my walk of life; no stop Was possible; or else my will was frail; Or is it that the first stumblings entail Weakness no after strength has power to prop? The heart puts forth her boughs; and these we lop For very wantonness; until the gale Is rank with blood; then our life-portions fail And we are fain to share another's sop. At first my heart was true and my soul true, And then the outside world believed me false. Therefore my sweets grew bitter, and I thrust Life back, till it stood still and turned to must. Yet sometimes through the great stagnation calls Of spirits reach me: is it so with you? [So I grew half delirious and quite sick] So I grew half delirious and quite sick, And thro' the darkness saw strange faces grin Of Monsters at me. One put forth a fin, And touched me clammily: I could not pick A quarrel with it: it began to lick My hand, making meanwhile a piteous din And shedding human tears: it would begin To near me, then retreat. I heard the quick Pulsation of my heart, I marked the fight Of life and death within me; then sleep threw Her veil around me; but this thing is true: When I awoke the sun was at his height, And I wept sadly, knowing that one new Creature had love for me, and others spite. [On the note you do not send me] On the note you do not send me I have thought too long: adieu. Hope and fear no longer rend me:— Home is near: not news of you. CHARON In my cottage near the Styx Co. and Charon still combine Us to ferry o'er like bricks In a boat of chaste design. Cerberus, thou triple fair, Distance doth thy charms impair: Let the passage give to us Charon, Co., and Cerberus. CHORUS Now the passage gives us to Charon, Cerberus, and Co. FROM METASTASIO First, last, and dearest, My love, mine own, Thee best beloved, Thee love alone, Once and for ever So love I thee. First as a suppliant Love makes his moan, Then as a monarch Sets up his throne: Once and for ever— So love I thee. GOLDEN HOLLY Common Holly bears a berry To make Christmas Robins merry:— Golden Holly bears a rose, Unfolding at October's close To cheer an old Friend's eyes and nose. [I toiled on, but thou] I toiled on, but thou Wast weary of the way, And so we parted: now Who shall say Which is happier—I or thou? I am weary now On the solitary way: But art thou rested, thou? Who shall say Which of us is calmer now? Still my heart's love, thou, In thy secret way, Art still remembered now: Who shall say— Still rememberest thou? COR MIO Still sometimes in my secret heart of hearts I say “Cor mio” when I remember you, And thus I yield us both one tender due, Welding one whole of two divided parts. Ah Friend, too wise or unwise for such arts, Ah noble Friend, silent and strong and true, Would you have given me roses for the rue For which I bartered roses in love's marts? So late in autumn one forgets the spring, Forgets the summer with its opulence, The callow birds that long have found a wing, The swallows that more lately got them hence: Will anything like spring, will anything Like summer, rouse one day the slumbering sense? [My old admiration before I was twenty,—] My old admiration before I was twenty,— Is predilect still, now promoted to se'enty! My own demi-century plus an odd one Some weight to my judgment may fairly impart. Accept this faint flash of a smouldering fun, The fun of a heavy old heart. TO MARY ROSSETTI You were born in the Spring When the pretty birds sing In sunbeamy bowers: Then dress like a Fairy, Dear dumpling my Mary, In green and in flowers. TO MY FIOR-DI-LISA The Rose is Love's own flower, and Love's no less The Lily's tenderness. Then half their dignity must Roses yield To Lilies of the field? Nay, diverse notes make up true harmony, All-fashioned loves agree: Love wears the Lily's whiteness, and Love glows In the deep-hearted Rose. [Hail, noble face of noble friend!—] Hail, noble face of noble friend!— Hail, honoured master hand and dear!— On you may Christmas good descend And blessings of the unknown year So soon to overtake us here. Unknown, yet well known: I portend Love starts the course, love seals the end. Hymn O the bitter shame and sorrow That a time could ever be, When I let the Saviour's pity Plead in vain, and proudly answered “All of Self, and none of Thee.” Yet He found me; I beheld Him Bleeding on the accursed Tree; Heard Him pray “Forgive them, Father!” And my wistful heart said faintly “Some of Self, and some of Thee.” Day by day, His tender mercy, Healing, helping, full and free, Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient, Brought me lower, while I whispered “Less of Self, and more of Thee.” Higher than the highest Heaven, Deeper than the deepest sea, “Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered, Grant me now my soul's desire None of Self, and all of Thee.”</field>
