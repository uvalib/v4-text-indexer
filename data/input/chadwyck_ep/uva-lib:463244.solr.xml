Beholde you yonge Ladyes, of hyghe parentage And you yonge virgyns, of eche degre Here is a pamphlet, euen mete for your age Where as in a myrrour, you maye lerne and se. Howe vycyous loue, you shulde eschewe and fle Hauynge alway shamfastnes, ? your maydenly face Then can you neuer mysse, of vertue and grace. To loue I counceyll you, neuer enclyne Excepe onely, it be for maryage To the entent, to haue therby lyne yet in that case, take hede you not rage For hasty loue c?monly, ryght soone wyll aswage And beware that you loue not, before you be wyse Lest you repent you, more ofter than twyse. Yet dyuers in loue, hath had happy chaunce I speke by my selfe, and many one mo That of perfyte chaste loue, haue ben in the daunce And sped to our myndes, yet for to do so Thousandes haue myssed, and fynysshed in wo Therfore I rede you, take good aduysement Of good abydynge, none can repent. Called is the name, of this lytell boke The (Maydens dreme) whiche I hope shalbe For your erudycions, yf you therin loke Many a good instruccyon, here shall you se Howe vertue to ensue, and vyce for to fle For herein is contayned, both golde and glasse They that worke well, shall well brynge to passe. Thus to god, I do you c?myt Prayenge you to accept, this my lytell warke For that it is so rudely done, is but for lacke of wyt Howe be it euery man, can not be a clarke Nor euery byrde flye, so hyghe as the larke Ye wot what I meane, thus fare you well Happy be they, that folowe good councell. Thus endeth the Prologue. The Maydens Dreme In the lusty, fresshe moneth of may When the byrdes reioyse, euery glad speryte With theyr venerien voyces, ? the dawne of the day Then I whiche had not slept, of the hole nyght By Morpleus sodaynly, had lost my syght Whiche ? a golden slombre, right soone had me cast Recheles youth, oft slepyth still fast. As soone as I in, this slombre was brought Two persons me semyd, appered in my syght The one sayd (fayre loue) cha?ge you must your thought For come is the daye, passed is the nyght Of chyldysshe ygnoraunce, wherfore of ryght you must nowe lerne, what you are come to your yeres shall ensygne you, what you shall do. You are, she sayd, fayre, fresshe, and goodlye Of all your membres, well proporcyoned One of the mynyonest, vnder the skye Amyable, pleasaunt, and well fauored Wherfore you shulde do, a great mysded yf to your age, you applye not your reason For eche thynge ought, to be taken in season. I neuer knewe, a more goodly mayden More comely of body, ne fayrer of vysage In your apparell, so fresshely besene All correspondent, vnto your swete age Your whyte quauer?g dugges, wold make a m? rage Of nature and loue, you be the chefe marke, Good is the workman, that fortunatly doth warke, Of reason and wysdom, you haue suffycyent As a mayde, of tender an age In you there wanteth, none intendement You are both wyse, be dyscrete and sage You be also extracte, of noble lynage Yet all this we maye, as nothynge repute Onles in due season, be gathered the frute. Yf I were a man, beleue me for certayne To be my loue, I wolde you requyre For of all other, you be the most souerayne Of bewtye, fauoure, and fresshe attyre There is none lyuynge, but wolde you desyre Your excellent bewtye, wolde a saynt moue Ryght happy is he, that hath a fayre loue. The mayden. Then with that, made they a pawse These two semblaunces, that I haue of tolde The one approched nyghe, promotynge her cause The other was not, fully so bolde Her mynde yet to vtter, I parceyued she wolde Thus w? me ? my slombre, they wonderly wrought Sowndly they slepe, that taketh no thought. Thus as I was, slomberynge in my slepe The swete sygnyfia?ce, of my dreme I gan to deuyse Also what were these Ladyes, I toke busykepe That had with me reasoned, in so straunge wyse Then theyr apparell, I dyd well aduyse Wherin were gret letters, which I dyd rede w? ease Alwayes newe thynges, doth meruaylously please. These letters forthwith, I began for to spell And set them togyther, with all myne entent As a mayden that coulde not, rede very well yet at the last, I knewe what they ment The names of these ladyes, that were so gent In them were contryued, wherfore to my mynde He that well sercheth, shall alwaye well fynde. The one was named (Amours) a noble dame Rychely arayed, and it had ben a quene As a lady of great renowme and fame Whiche we call loue, so fresshely besene The other was shamfastnes, y? worketh loue moche tene To wycked loue contrary, euer she is bent Symple was her chere, and also her rayment. Loue then began, with me for to reason So dyd shamfastnes, when she se her tyme They tolde me many, a goodly sermon Comynge before me, as strayght as a lyne And gaue me great batayle, eche one in theyr tyme Assaylynge me with wordes, that persed my harte Great is the assaulte, where none wyll astarte. Loue. Loue spake fyrste, and to me she dyd saye My fayre mynyon doughter, so tender and yonge Acustome thy youth, to sporte and to playe To daunce and to lute, with many a swete songe To haunte wanton company, to daly amonge For fro me thou hast not, yet scaped the trase youth must aquyte her, or she from the passe. Shamefastnes. Then answered shamefastnes, in sentence shorte My fayre doughter, you shall not do so For euyll is the worlde, beware of reporte If you so offended, howe shulde you then do your louers wolde despyse you, and leue you in wo So shulde you be shamed, in euery towne Bewtye is nothynge, without good renowne. Loue. Shame whiche of feare, is engendryd &amp; spronge With this her doughter, Shamefastnes Neuer dyd good, to them that be yonge (Sayd loue) for youth to deceyue doughtelesse They are euermore redy, to put them in presse Beleue her not fayre mayde, for all her pratle For age can nothynge, but bable and tatle. Shamefastnes. Ha my dere dought, howe sore were you to blame If suche an euyll woman, you dyd byleue Not worth a festue, were then your good name For euery creature, then wolde you repreue Whiche at the laste, full sore shulde you greue Therfore beware, lose not your vyrgynyte A vyrgyn is a name, of great honour &amp; oygnyte. Loue. If you gyue credence, to this dastardly shame You shall neuer be set by, a putred oynyon Take nowe your pleasure, lyke a lusty yonge dame Or euer that youth be, departed and gone Wherfore chuse, some goodly companyon With whom you maye take, all your lust &amp; plesa?ce There is no treasure, without suffycyaunce. Shamefastnes, Suche lyght counceyll, so soone to byleue And after to take therby, some dysease With grat payne you shulde, your selfe then releue Wherfore I wyll tell, that shulde you best please Suche hasty loue, is not worth a pease To cast awaye your selfe, euyll were y? quayntaunce For hasty loue, engendreth repentaunce. Loue. To suche a yonge damoysell, it doth appertayne To be fryske, both ioyous, and Iolye And when in suche poynt, she doth her mayntayne To counte her amysse, it were a great folye For she that with youth, can daunce best and dalye Is counted most noble, be it mayden or wyfe We haue in this worlde, no more but a lyfe. Shamefastnes. Helas, aduyse the, or euer thou smarte Or els thou shalt be, lyke a marche hare Lyftynge thy hed vp, euyn lyke a harte That thorowe the worlde, is chased with care From suche foly, my doughter, alwaye beware Be sobre and symple, and kepe the at home A mayde is not set by, when her sadnes is gone. Loue. Yea thou art thy mothers onely darlynge Therfore thou mayste, loue secretely In goodnes and honour, care for nothynge Praysed therfore, thou shalt be hyghly At Bankettes and playes, be present dayly At great feastes &amp; tornays, where most people resorte To moche to be fearefull, doth greatly dyscomforte. Shamefastnes. To be tymorous in youth, as semeth me Is a sygne, greatly for to be praysed For feare with youth, alwaye shulde be For recheles youth is, to be dyspysed Wherfore drede is a sygne, as I haue deuysed Of puer and clene chastyte, in mayden and wyfe Eche noble harte, ought to drede a shamfull lyfe. Loue. Is it then shame, for to be Ioyous And for to please, the people therby What shulde we be, of other scrypulous Or for that ensueth, to care for so greatly Who that in youth, wyll lyue solytary Prouyth by reason, to haue a weke spyryte The assaye (at the laste) makyth the warke perfyte Shamefastnes. Other to auayle, thy selfe for to harme Is no great wysdome, as semeth me I swere to the, by this ryght arme If thou to loue assent, thou doest great folye For thoughe thou, to thous?des set forth thy beaute They wyll therfore esteme y?, but lyke a beest sauage Fylthy is the water, out of the ryuage. Loue. Thynkest thou it synne, for to beholde Upon theyr fresshe cousers, these galantes so gaye Betraped in sylke, syluer, and golde Whiche with speare &amp; sheld, at the iustes doth assaye Manfully to wyn, the pryse yf they maye Whiche won thorowe your loue, they gyue you the prayse Thus amorus hartes, reioysen alwayes. Shamefastnes. Thou canst not do, to be more defamed Then of a louer, to haue the name For sonest by hym, thou shalt be shamed That flaterynge in Amours, wyll call the his dame God kepe the from suche, perpetuall shame Or to be in suche a hasarde, for to desyre A grene bough wyll bren, yf it be in the fyre. Loue. Reknowlege the goodes, gyuen the by nature That so largely hath endued y?, w? vert? manyfolde And eke ther w? hath formed the, so fayre a creature That it is a great pleasure, the for to beholde Lease not therfore thy tyme, aduenture and be bolde Leste thou yelde accompt, at the daye of dome We ought to take hede, of that shall after come. Shamefastnes. The more goodly that nature, hath the formed And with the more bewtye, she hath the furnysshed So moche more w? grace, thou shuldest be endoctryned And with great vertues, for to be garnysshed For yf thy harte to euyll, then be enployed For euermore, thou shalt lose thy good name Well doth they watche, that flyeth fro shame. Loue. It were no nede (me thynke) the to warne If euer loue, had done the dyspleasure Or to moue the therto so it were for thy harme Rede the hystoryes, and thou shalt fynde I am sure What payne noble parsons, for loue wolde endure Yea were she neuer so hygh a prynces To loue or be loued, wolde put her in prees. Shamefastnes. Some ladyes I thynke, hath ben conuerted With dyssolute loue, them selfes to acquaynte Whiche after ryght sore hath them repented In makynge many a dolefull complaynte Better thou were of that to make restraynte Then forthwith to repent, as it were past and gone For a thynge that is done, remedye is none. Loue. Dyd not kynge Arthurs moste noble wyfe Ysode polixiene, and also medee And many mo ladyes of excellent lyfe To Amorus loue, gyue all theyr stude Whiche hath gyuen them a name of perpetuyte Nowe of this tell me, who can them reproue They neuer had Ioye, that neuer dyd loue. Shamefastnes. Who that wold serche, theyr storyes thorow out Shulde fynde theyr ende, to be nothynge honorable For dolorously all they endyd, without dout As god be vnto me fauorable Therfore be not to them agreable Of examples there be, mo then one or two Lascyuyous loue, doth fynysshe in wo. Loue. Narcissus that to loue, wolde neuer assent Was chaunged by a fountayn, as in Ouid we fynde By the goddes sharpe, and ryghtfull Iudgement Be neuer therfore, so hawte nor vnkynde But loue them agayne, whose harte y? hast &amp; mynde So shalt thou loue, for loue optayne Honorable loue, is neuer in vayne. Shamefastnes. Susanne for her chastyte, of god was preserued Bycause to folysshe loue, she wolde not condyscend Saued she was, from beynge defoyled Her honoure to kepe, she dyd euer entend Hard was her begynnynge, vyctoryous was the end Therfore lerne this of me, both mayden and wyfe To dred toffend god, is a blyssed lyfe. Loue. One maye well loue, without vyllanye Or that any dyshonour, therby shulde aryse For yf that any vyllayne, do thynke any folye God can correct hym, in sondery wyse In all honoure (my doughter) do not despyse To loue, as nature doth entend They that do as they ought, do not offend. Shamefastnes. Swete and atrayant, is the enterynge in to loue It is hony with gall, and myrre confycte The begynnynge dowse, the end bytter to proue For it wyl leue the assoone, as it seeth the discomfyte In wo and care, wherfore it were great profyte Neuer therin to enter, for all the kynde femynyne For in the tayle, lyeth all the venyme. Loue. When a secrete man, you do parceyue and fynde Hym truely to loue, you nede not to drede So that he be loyall, secrete and kynde In louynge suche one, you can not yll spede For eche of you shall haue to your mede All your pleasure togyther, with great Ioye &amp; solace One can not loue, in euery place. Shamefastnes. Nothynge there is, so secretely hyd But it is openly knowen, to all at the last There was neuer woman, so well assuryd That to couer her cryme, yet had the cast But out it must, by some euyll blast For feare to euery hascard, then must thou enclyne Loue can departe, when she seeth tyme. Loue. Herken (my swete loue) is it not great owtrage That is thus spoken, by this ypocryte Helas, what wylt thou do, with thy yonge age Shalt thou passe it ouer, as in the darke nyght And thus cowardly, to put loue to flyght Not payeng the trybute, of thy yonge dayes Warkes be not fynysshed, without the assayes. Shamefastnes. My syster to loue, without flaterynge Engendreth good loue, withouten fable But the stroke of the matrasse, aft losed is the stryng If it flye farre, is not very stable So cordiall loue, to all agreable If it be put to farre, at aduenture With payne can forget, suche is her nature. Loue. If nature wolde forfet, aboue yet is dame reason For to withdrawe, and in tyme to correct To thende that none shulde be deceyued at no season Therfore thou mayst loue, withouten suspect Of any creature, for to be detect If thou rule the by reason I swere by god on hye For reason doth gouerne, aboue the sterry skye. Shamefanes.

Shamefastnes Haue shame alwayes, before your iyes When you shall be to loue esprysed The worlde shall loue you, in the more goodly wyse And you shall not therby, of god be despysed Thus let alwaye your empryse, be wysely conduted To god I c?mende you, for done is my message Who good counceyll beleueth, is counted as sage.
