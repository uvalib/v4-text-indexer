      <field name="fulltext">âI named them, as they passed, and understood Their nature.â MILTON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LION. The gloomy forests fearful king; Symbol of Judah's tribe of yore: Man starts! and Beasts from sleep upspring Hearing at night, thy savage roar. THE LIONESS. Mate of the strong, the fierce, the free! A Mother's heart is found in thee: And for the Cubs that claim thy care, As bravely wilt thou âdo, and dareâ! THE LEOPARD. Can the Leopard change his spots? Or the Ethiop his skin? Then may those do good who bear Still an Unchang'd Heart within! THE WOLF. Ugly, cunning, fierce and cruel! Can the Poet say or do ill, If his only comment be May no Child resemble thee? THE BEAR. Though rugged be his coat and form, And homely be his face; The first, at least, looks very warm; Butâtrust not his embrace. THE POLAR BEAR. The large White Bears mid Polar Snows, In Winter sleep, in Summer roam; There they can wander or repose For God hath given them there a Home! THE FOX. The Fox is timid, cautious, sly; And keeps by day, the peace: But when dark night obscures the sky, Will steal Cocks, Hens, and Geese. THE JACKAL. Ranking the Dog and Wolf between, He wakes less love than dread; And may be called a beast unclean For preying on the dead ! THE BOAR. The Boar is savage, fierce, and strong; His tusks are sharp, his tusks are long: And when he turns and stands at bay, I had much rather be away! THE WILD ASS. The Desert's graceful Anchorite His form is comely swift his flight; And like the Anchorite he lives, On littleâwhich the Desert gives. HART &amp; HIND &amp;c. Stately and graceful Hart and Hind; Comely both Red and Fallow Deer; Pity it seems that sports unkind Should make you look on Man with fear. THE ELK. Thou bear'st thy branchy Antlers well, Which almost seem to me, Like Coral fans that grow and dwell Beneath the briny sea. REIN-DEER. The Laplander thy worth well knows, Thou bears't him o'er the frozen snows; He on thy milk, thy flesh is fed, Thy skin supplies his clothes and bed. THE IBEX. The high rocks are thy home As by Nature meant to be For thy foot alone to roam, And a refuge unto thee. THE ROEBUCK &amp;c. The Roebuck and the Antelope Of speed and beauty rare; What beast can with their swiftness cope? Or with their grace compare? THE CAMELOPARD. âCamelopardus browsing lifts Her lengthened neck and unassuming eye.â STRONG. THE ELEPHANT. Gigantic in thy height and girth, Of brutes by magnitude the king: Yet the same God who gave thee birth, Created every creeping thing. THE WILD OX. A wild, and fearful foe! Pity, his lot forlorn, Doom'd to endure one blow From either hoof, or horn! HARE &amp; WEASEL. The Hare, though timid, cautious, shy, By kindness has been tamed: The pilfering Weasel, subtle, sly, By art is unreclaimed. RABBITS. Unlike our own domestic pet, The eastern Coney's home Among the pathless rocks is set. Where he at will may roam. THE BADGER. The Badger can but give its skin! Our motto's meaning scan; His Offering will acceptance win. Who givesâwhate'er he can! THE CAMEL. Patient, temperate, useful beast! Well may nations of The East Gratefully assert thy worth, In the sandy desert's dearth. CAMEL FURNITURE. Sometimes deck'd in plumage gay, Bearing ladies on their way, Stately is its proud array. CAMEL FURNITURE. Sometimes in a plainer dress, Humbler travellers may bless, Equally its usefulness! ARAB HORSE. The Arab boasts a noble Steed, Matchless in beauty, and in speed; Who well repays, by merits rare, His master's kindness, and his care. THE MULE, AND THE ASS. Of quadrupeds a comely pair, Well fitted for man's use; Alas! that both so oft should bear His anger, and abuse! THE LABORING OX. In the olden time, with thee Husbandmen were wont to plough, And, at times, I like to see Thee, at thy old calling, now! THE COW. In the grassy vale, or mead, Let The Cow in quiet feed; That boys and girls at even-tide May be with her rich milk supplied. MANNER OF THRESHING. That simple process do not scorn, Which taught a precept all have read; The Ox that treadeth out thy corn, Shall, in his turn, be fed! EASTERN WAGGON. Most haste worse speedâold proverbs say, But slowly, surely, wins the day: Whate'er they did in ages past, We travel, and we liveâtoo fast. SHEEP. Remote the piping Shepherd see; Nearer behold each butting Ram; While underneath the branching tree, The Ewe gives suck unto her lamb. GOATS. Playful, frolicsome in Youth! Grave and solemn made by years, Even such, in sober truth, Boy and Man full oft appears. GREYHOUND &amp; TERRIER. The Greyhoundâgraceful, tall, and slim; The Terrierârough, of dwarfish limb; The first hath most to charm the eye, The lastâmost shrewd fidelity! NEWFOUNDLAND DOG. Form'd to dare the drifted snow, Or to breast the briny wave; Thine is merit passing show, Faithful, and acute, and brave! SWINE. Of filthy habits, and repulsive mien, I marvel not the Law, by Moses writ, Should have denounced thee as a beast unclean, For human food unfit! THE REEM. A by-gone beast; in days of old For strength, and fierceness famed; No moreâin forest, or in fold, Among us known, or named. THE RHINOCEROS. Beauty thou hast none to boast, Few uglier frequent the plain; But of natures countless host Not one was made in vain! THE HIPPOPOTAMUS, OR RIVER HORSE. Steed of the mazy, sedgy stream, That flows through Egypt's sands; Like some grim phantom of a dream Thy form colossal stands. THE LEVIATHAN, OR CROCODILE. Another monster of the Nile! The mailed and jointed Crocodile; He were, indeed a mighty man, Who dared to hook Leviathan! THE ICHNEUMON. The Ichneumon! The Ichneumon! Tis but a little thing; And yet it keeps in check the pride Of the Nile's scaly king. MICE: 1,COMMON, 2,DWARF, 3,WATER SHREW, 4,MOLE. Of Mice, or Moles, can bard indite Or long or lofty lays? Yet even these, beheld aright, Declare their Maker's praise! THE EAGLE. Of feather'd tribes the fearless king! Lofty, and swift of flight; Upsoaring on the buoyant wing To greet the orb of light. THE VULTURE. Fierce and ravenous foul-feeder! With scant grace to be thy pleader; Thee we might almost describe Of the fabled Harpy tribe. THE OSTRICH. The âCamel-Birdâ thou hast been styled; And in thy sandy deserts wild The fleetness of thy foot supplies All want of wings in air to rise. THE PELICAN. Moping, melancholy bird Of the lonely wilderness! In the Psalmist's plaint preferr'd A type of his distress. THE STORK. On lofty roof, or fir-tree high, With curious skill displayed, Thy nest, or âHouseâ arrests the eye, Of grass and sticks 'tis made. THE CRANE. The Crane and Swallow know their time! And doubt not, nor demur; While Man, tho' taught by Truth sublime, Is often wont to err. DOVES. Emblems of innocence, and love, On earth below: but heaven above Must perfectly exemplify True love, and spotless purity. PEA-FOWL &amp; SPARROWS. Peacock and Pea-hen charm the eye, And for our admiration call: With such dull Sparrows cannot vie; But God hath made them all. THE HERON. Bird of the lonely lake, And solitary stream; Patient for plunder's sake, And silent as a dream! QUAIL &amp; PARTRIDGE. The Quail in ancient days was sent To Israelâas a punishment: The Partridge unto us supplies One of our many luxuries. HAWK &amp; OWL. The Hawk, with active vigilance, Darts swiftly on his prey: The Owl, with solemn countenance Shrinks from the glare of day. BATS. Creeping thing, on dull wings flying. This thy attribute, at least, In Being's chain a link supplying Betwixt Bird and Beast. THE RAVEN. A Bird unclean! Omen of ill! Thou hast been said to be: Yet the Almighty's sovereign will His Prophet fed by thee. COCK &amp; HEN. âWhen the Cock crew, he weptâ! The words recall The Apostle's penitence, nor less his fall! The Hen, her young ones gathering 'neath her wings, His Master's pity to remembrance brings. THE WHALE. Giant Monarch of the Deep! Seas of ice, and cliffs of snow Cannot thee in safety keep: For there thy spoilers go! HORNED VIPER. Cunning, and ugly! I were loth To meet a reptile blending both; Nor would encounter for a bribe, This sample of the Serpent tribe. GREAT BOA OF SOUTH AMERICA. More of beauty thou may'st boast, Than the viper tribe can win; Yet I well should count the cost, Ere I slew thee for thy skin. SERPENT OF THE ISLE OF CELEBES. Sinuous monster! long and lithe, In thy fearful coil, Man, though he may briefly writhe, Soon becomes thy spoil. RATTLE-SNAKE &amp; FOX. Reynard! hearest thou that rattle! Think not thou of giving battle; Ere the reptile on thee rush, Use thy legs, and save thy brush! 1,FLEA, 2,SPIDERS, 3,ANTS, 4,FLY. Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard! Consider her ways, and be wise: But can we award such a tribute Unto Fleas, or Spiders, or Flies? 1,SCORPIONS, 2,WASP, 3,BEES, 4,GRASSHOPPER. The Scorpion and Wasp are too apt to sting. Favour to find with me; But I love to hear the Grasshopper sing. And the busy humming Bee! MOTHS, WITH THEIR CATERPILLARS &amp; AURELIAS. In the unsightly, crawling Worm, Or the Aurelia's husky cell, Who would think the hidden germ Of such loveliness could dwell? BUTTERFLIES. The Butterflyâfrom hour to hour, Flutters about from flower to flower, And, glistening in the sun's bright beams, Almost a winged flowret seems! BEETLE. Its mailed coat, and filmy wing Such contraries unite; That thoughts and fancies it may bring Of battle, or of flight. LOCUST, HORNET &amp; ANTS. Locusts, Hornets, waken fear, Ants to Industry are dear; Be not like the former two, But the latter's course pursue. WORMS &amp; SNAILS. Of Worm, or creeping thing, Like those depicted here, Could Poet hope to sing And find a listening ear? SNAIL &amp; FROG. Both Snail and Frog have rights to plead, And yet it might be wrong To praise the former for its speed, The latter for its song. SYCAMORE. The Tree by Zaccheus climb'd of yore, Sight of His Lord to win; The Lord he sought, by Gospel lore May now be found within. EGYPTIAN WHEAT. The seven-ear'd wheat of Egypt's land Dreamt of by Egypt's King; And well did Joseph understand That dream's fore-shadowing. SPIKENARD. Hypocrisy the waste deplor'd, When Spikenard on His head was pour'd; Yet still that box its perfume gives, And in undying fragrance lives. CAMPHIRE &amp; ROSE. The Camphire may disclose Beauty and fragrance round; But in the peerless Rose The garden's queen is found. PALM TREE &amp; VINE. The stately Palm, the fruitful Vine, Emblems of Grace and Glory shine; Of fruit borne unto God on high, And crown'd with immortality. THE FIG TREE &amp; ALMOND TREE. Though the Fig-tree should not blossom, Nor the Almond-tree bear fruit, Yet peace within the bosom Shall bid thankless thoughts be mute. POMEGRANATE. Of grateful fruit, of lovely flower; An emblem still thou art, Which grace divine alone has power To impress upon the heart. THE OLIVE, &amp; CEDAR. The labour of the Olive-tree May fail;âthe Cedar fade; But whoso trusts, O Lord! in thee, Need never be afraid. BARBARY APE &amp; OURAN OUTANG. Barbary Ape! Ouran Outang! Enough you Man resemble To give his Pride a moment's pang, And make his self-love tremble. PROBOSCIS &amp; HORNED MONKEY. Proboscis! Horned Monkey too! I've look'd quite long enough at you; And gladly bid you both adieu! SPOTTED MONKEY, &amp; LION-TAILED BABOON. A Monkey with spots, a Baboon lion-tail'd, Are neither good subjects for rhyme; So if in my tribute to both I have fail'd, It should hardly be counted a crime. BABOON &amp; APE. Enough of both Baboon, and Ape, They do not suit my taste; From either gladly I escape, On neither time would waste.</field>
