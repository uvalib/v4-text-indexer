      <field name="fulltext">THE TESTAMENT OF BEAUTY BOOK I INTRODUCTION Mortal Prudence, handmaid of divine Providence, hath inscrutable reckoning with Fate and Fortune: We sail a changeful sea through halcyon days and storm, and when the ship laboureth, our stedfast purpose trembles like as the compass in a binnacle. Our stability is but balance, and wisdom lies in masterful administration of the unforeseen. 'Twas late in my long journey, when I had clomb to where the path was narrowing and the company few, a glow of childlike wonder enthral'd me, as if my sense had come to a new birth purified, my mind enrapt re-awakening to a fresh initiation of life; with like surprise of joy as any man may know who rambling wide hath turn'd, resting on some hill-top to view the plain he has left, and see'th it now out-spredd mapp'd at his feet, a landscape so by beauty estranged he scarce wil ken familiar haunts, nor his own home, maybe, where far it lieth, small as a faded thought. Or as I well remember one highday in June bright on the seaward South-downs, where I had come afar on a wild garden planted years agone, and fenced thickly within live-beechen walls: the season it was of prodigal gay blossom, and man's skill had made a fair-order'd husbandry of that nativ pleasaunce: But had ther been no more than earth's wild loveliness, the blue sky and soft air and the unmown flowersprent lawns, I would have lain me down and long'd, as then I did, to lie there ever indolently undisturb'd, and watch the common flowers that starr'd the fine grass of the wold, waving in gay display their gold-heads to the sun, each telling of its own inconscient happiness, each type a faultless essence of God's will, such gems as magic master-minds in painting or music threw aside once for man's regard or disregard; things supreme in themselves, eternal, unnumber'd in the unexplored necessities of Life and Love. To such a mood I had come, by what charm I know not, where on thatt upland path I was pacing alone; and yet was nothing new to me, only all was vivid and significant that had been dormant or dead: as if in a museum the fossils on their shelves should come to life suddenly, or a winter rose-bed burst into crowded holiday of scent and bloom. I felt the domination of Nature's secret urge, and happy escape therein; as when in boyhood once from the rattling workshops of a great factory conducted into the engine-room I stood in face of the quiet driving power, that fast in nether cave seated, set all the floors a-quiver, a thousand looms throbbing and jennies dancing; and I felt at heart a kinship with it and sympathy, as children wil with amicable monsters: for in truth the mind is indissociable from what it contemplates, as thirst and generous wine are to a man that drinketh nor kenneth whether his pleasur is more in his desire or in the savor of the rich grape that allays it. Man's Reason is in such deep insolvency to sense, that tho' she guide his highest flight heav'nward, and teach him dignity morals manners and human comfort, she can delicatly and dangerously bedizen the rioting joys that fringe the sad pathways of Hell. Nor without alliance of the animal senses hath she any miracle: Lov'st thou in the blithe hour of April dawns—nay marvelest thou not—to hear the ravishing music that the small birdës make in garden or woodland, rapturously heralding the break of day; when the first lark on high hath warn'd the vigilant robin already of the sun's approach, and he on slender pipe calleth the nesting tribes to awake and fill and thrill their myriad-warbling throats praising life's God, untill the blisful revel grow in wild profusion unfeign'd to such a hymn as man hath never in temple or grove pour'd to the Lord of heav'n? Hast thou then thought that all this ravishing music, that stirreth so thy heart, making thee dream of things illimitable unsearchable and of heavenly import, is but a light disturbance of the atoms of air, whose jostling ripples, gather'd within the ear, are tuned to resonant scale, and thence by the enthron'd mind received on the spiral stairway of her audience chamber as heralds of high spiritual significance? and that without thine ear, sound would hav no report, Nature hav no music; nor would ther be for thee any better melody in the April woods at dawn than what an old stone-deaf labourer, lying awake o' night in his comfortless attic, might perchance be aware of, when the rats run amok in his thatch? Now since the thoughtless birds not only act and enjoy this music, but to their offspring teach it with care, handing on those small folk-songs from father to son in such faithful tradition that they are familiar unchanging to the changeful generations of men— and year by year, listening to himself the nightingale as amorous of his art as of his brooding mate practiseth every phrase of his espousal lay, and still provoketh envy of the lesser songsters with the same notes that woke poetic eloquence alike in Sophocles and the sick heart of Keats— see then how deeply seated is the urgence whereto Bach and Mozart obey'd, or those other minstrels who pioneer'd for us on the marches of heav'n and paid no heed to wars that swept the world around, nor in their homes were more troubled by cannon-roar than late the small birds wer, that nested and carol'd upon the devastated battlefields of France. Birds are of all animals the nearest to men for that they take delight in both music and dance, and gracefully schooling leisure to enliven life wer the earlier artists: moreover in their airy flight (which in its swiftness symboleth man's soaring thought) they hav no rival but man, and easily surpass in their free voyaging his most desperate daring, altho' he hath fed and sped his ocean-ships with fire; and now, disturbing me as I write, I hear on high his roaring airplanes, and idly raising my head see them there; like a migratory flock of birds that rustle southward from the cold fall of the year in order'd phalanx—so the thin-rankt squadrons ply, till sound and sight failing me they are lost in the clouds. Man's happiness, his flaunting honey'd flower of soul, is his loving response to the wealth of Nature. Beauty is the prime motiv of all his excellence, his aim and peaceful purpose; whereby he himself becoming a creator hath often a thought to ask why Nature, being so inexhaustible of beauty, should not be all-beauteous; why, from infinit resource, produce more ugliness than human artistry with any spiritual intention can allow? Wisdom wil repudiate thee, if thou think to enquire why things are as they are or whence they came: thy task is first to learn what is, and in pursuant knowledge pure intellect wil find pure pleasur and the only ground for a philosophy conformable to truth. And wouldst thou play Creator and Ordinator of things, be Nature then thy Chaos and be thou her God! Whereafter if in spirit dishearten'd and distress'd to find evil with good, ugly with beautiful proffer'd by Nature indifferently without shame, thou wilt proceed to judge, but in conning thy brief suspect the prejudice of human self-regard distinguishing moralities where never is none— thou art come round wrongfully again to question Nature, who by her own faculty in thee judgeth herself: to impugn thy verdict is to unseat thatt judge. And science vindicateth the appeal to Reason which is no less Nature's prescriptiv oracle for being in all her plan so small and tickle a thing: How small a thing! if things immeasurable allow a greater and less (and thought wil reckon some thoughts great, prolific, everlasting; other some again small and contemptible) say then, How small a part of Universal Mind can conscient Reason claim! 'Tis to the unconscious mind as the habitable crust is to the mass of the earth; this crust whereon we dwell whereon our loves and shames are begotten and buried, our first slime and ancestral dust: 'Tis, to compare, thinner than o'er a luscious peach the velvet skin that we rip off to engorge the rich succulent pulp: Wer but our planet's sphere so peel'd, flay'd of the rind that wraps its lava and rock, the solar satellite would keep its motions in God's orrery undisturb'd. Yea: and how delicat! Life's mighty mystery sprang from eternal seeds in the elemental fire, self-animat in forms that fire annihilates: all its selfpropagating organisms exist only within a few degrees of the long scale rangeing from measured zero to unimagin'd heat, a little oasis of Life in Nature's desert; and ev'n therein are our soft bodies vext and harm'd by their own small distemperature, nor could they endure wer't not that by a secret miracle of chemistry they hold internal poise upon a razor-edge that may not ev'n be blunted, lest we sicken and die. This Intellect, whereby above the other species Mankind assumeth genus in a rank apart, is nascent also in brutes, and of their bloodkinship as fair a warranty as our common passions are, our common bones and muscles, skin and nerves of sense. But because human sorrow springeth of man's thought, some men hav fal'n unhappily to envy the brutes who for mere lack of reason, love life and enjoy existence without care: and in some sort doubtless happier are they than many a miserable man, whether in disease or misfortune outclass'd from life or thru' the disillusion of Lust wreck'd in remorse: Corruption of best is ever the worst corruption. 'Tis true ther is no balance to weigh these goods and ills nor any measur of them, like as of colour and heat in their degrees; they are incommensurable in kind. 'Tis with mere pleasur and pain as if they, being so light, coud not this way or thatt deflect Life's monarch-beam; for howso deliberatly a man may wish for death still wil he instinctivly fight to the last for life. Yet with the burden of thought pains are of great moment, and sickening thought itself engendereth corporal pain: But likewise also of pleasure—here too Reason again, whether in prospect or memory, is the greater part; our hope is ever livelier than despair, our joy livelier and more abiding than our sorrows are, which leak away untill no taint remain; their seeds shriveling too thin to lodge in Memory's hustled sieve. Wherefore I assert:—if Reason's only function wer to heighten our pleasure, that wer vindication enough; For what wer pleasur if never contemplation gave a spiritual significance to objects of sense, nor in thought's atmosphere poetic vision arose? Brutes hav their keener senses far outrangeing ours nor without here and there some adumbration of soul: But the sensuous intuition in them is steril, 'tis the bare cloth whereon our rich banquet is spredd; and so the sorrowful sufferer who envied their state, wer he but granted his blind wish to liv as they —whether 'twer lark or lion, or some high-antler'd stag in startled pose of his fantastic majesty gazing adown the glade—he would draw blank, nor taste the human satisfaction of his release from care: as well be a sloven toad in his dark hole: Unlike those damn'd souls by the Harpies tantalized in Hell whose tortur it was to see their ostentatious feast snatch'd from their reach—but he sitting with the dainties out-spredd before him would see them, nor ever feel any desire nor memory of their old relish. This quarrel and dissatisfaction of man with Nature springeth of a vision which beareth assurance of the diviner principle implicit in Life: And mystic Vision may so wholly absorb a man that he wil loathe ev'n pleasure, mortifying the flesh by disciplin of discomfort so to strengthen his faith. Thus tho' 'twas otherwise than on Plato's ladder that Francis climb'd—rather his gentle soul had learn'd from taste of vanity and by malease of the flesh— he abjured as worthless ev'n what good men will call good, and standing forth, as chivalrous knight and champion of holiness, in his devotion of heart to God, all earthly sun-joys seem'd so transitory and vain that soon the unseen took shape to common eyes; the folk cumber'd him with servility, and his memory is beatified in the admiration of all mankind. Now his following in life and his fame thereafter confute the lower school of Ethick, which would teach that spiritual ideas are but dream-stuff in men: For Francis admitted no compromise nor gloss whereby the Church had thought to ease the easy yoke which he reshoulder'd as his Master had offer'd it, and espousing Poverty as the outcast widow of Christ would walk in Umbria as He walk'd in Galilee founding the kingdom of God among those angry Jews who made earthly rebellion against Caesar's empire: and in imitation and compassion of Jesus would touch nothing but what had been bless'd at his lips: For the morrow hav no more care than a lily hath— for his head less shelter than a beast of the field— no purse nor scrip for his journey and but one garment— and scorning intellect and pursuit of knowledge liv'd as a bare spirit in its low prison of flesh, until thru' tribulation he should win to peace, quam mundus nobis dare non potest pacem, in those eternal mansions where Dante found him among the Just. Yet ev'n Francis coud praise Nature, tho' from such altitude whatever pictur is drawn must be out of focus of our terrestrial senses. 'Twas thus he made, when he lay sick in Damian, his hymn in honour of God and praise of his creatures; All-first and specially of the Sun whom he calleth his honourable brother and symbol of Very God; and then the Moon his sister, and all the stars of heav'n the clouds and winds his kindred; and of the Earth he saith— Praisèd be thou, my Lord, for my sister, Mother Earth, who doth sustain and govern us and bringeth forth all manner of fruit and herb and flowers of myriad hue. In direst pain of body and despond of soul he ask'd but for this Bencitè to be sung by his bed, fleeing for sanctuary to the bond of Nature— “the inconceivable high works unfathomable whose aspect giveth the Angels strength, and men revere the gentle changes of the day.”— The sky's unresting cloudland, that with varying play sifteth the sunlight thru' its figured shades, that now stand in massiv range, cumulated stupendous mountainous snowbillowy up-piled in dazzling sheen, Now like sailing ships on a calm ocean drifting, Now scatter'd wispy waifs, that neath the eager blaze disperse in air; Or now parcelling the icy inane highspredd in fine diaper of silver and mother-of-pearl freaking the intense azure; Now scurrying close o'erhead, wild ink-hued random racers that fling sheeted rain gustily, and with garish bows laughing o'erarch the land: Or, if the spirit of storm be abroad, huge molten glooms mount on the horizon stealthily, and gathering as they climb deep-freighted with live lightning, thunder and drenching flood rebuff the winds, and with black-purpling terror impend til they be driven away, when grave Night peacefully clearing her heavenly rondure of its turbid veils layeth bare the playthings of Creation's babyhood; and the immortal fireballs of her uttermost space twinkle like friendly rushlights on the countryside. Them soon the jealous Day o'errideth to display Earth's green robe, which the sun fostereth for shelter and shower; The dance of young trees that in a wild birch-spinney toss to and fro the cluster of their flickering crests, as rye curtseying in array to the breeze of May; The ancestral trunks that mightily in the forest choirs rear stedfast colonnade, or imperceptibly sway in tall pinewoods to their whispering spires; The woodland's alternating hues, the vaporous bloom of the first blushings and tender flushings of spring; The slumbrous foliage of high midsummer's wealth; Rich Autumn's golden quittance, to the bankruptcy of the black shapely skeletons standing in snow: Or, in gay months of swelling pomp, the luxury of leisur'd gardens teeming with affection'd thought; the heartfelt secrecy of rustic nooks, and valleys vocal with angelic rilling of rocky streams, by rambling country-lanes, with hazel and thorn embower'd woodbine, bryony and wild roses; the landscape lure of rural England, that held glory in native art untill our painters took their new fashion from France. This spiritual elation and response to Nature is Man's generic mark. A wolf that all his life had hunted after nightfall neath the starlit skies should he suddenly attain the first inklings of thought would feel this Wonder: and by some kindred stir of mind the ruminants can plead approach—the look of it is born already of fear and gentleness in the eyes of the wild antelope, and hence by fable assign'd to the unseen unicorn reposed in burning lair— a symbol of majestic sadness and lonely pride: but the true intellectual wonder is first reveal'd in children and savages and 'tis there the footing of all our temples and of all science and art. Thus Rafaël once venturing to show God in Man gave a child's eyes of wonder to his baby Christ; and his Mantuan brother coud he hav seen that picture would more truly hav foreshadow'd the incarnation of God. 'Tis divinest childhood's incomparable bloom, the loss whereof leaveth the man's face shabby and dull. SEEKING unceasingly for the First Cause of All, in question for what special Purpose he was made, Man, in the unsearchable darkness, knoweth one thing that as he is, so was he made: and if the Essence and characteristic faculty of humanity is our conscient Reason and our desire of knowledge, thatt was Nature's Purpose in the making of man. But can there be any Will or Purpose in Nature? thatt Universe external to our percipient sense, which when we examin itself we think only to find a structur of blind atoms to their habits enslaved, or else, examining our senses, suspect to be a dream of empty appearance and vain imagery.— As a man thru' a window into a darken'd house peering vainly wil see, always and easily, the glass surface and his own face mirror'd thereon, tho' looking from another angle, or hooding his eyes he may discern some real objects within the room— some say 'tis so with us, and also affirm that they by study of their reflection hav discover'd in truth ther is nothing but thatt same reflection inside the house. See how they have made o' the window an impermeable wall partitioning man off from the rest of nature with stronger impertinence than Science can allow. Man's mind, Nature's entrusted gem, her own mirror cannot bë isolated from her other works by self-abstraction of its unique fecundity in the new realm of his transcendent life;— Not emotion or imagination ethic or art logic of science nor dialectic discourse, not even thatt supersensuous sublimation of thought, the euristic vision of mathematical trance, hath any other foundation than the common base of Nature's building:—not even his independence of will, his range of knowledge, and spiritual aim, can separate him off from the impercipient: Altho' his mind be such that it might seem as if true Individuality within the species were peculiar to man: So foolish is he, and wise,— despondent and hopeful, patient and complaining, courageous and cowardly, diffident and vain, cringing and commanding, industrious and idle, cruel and tenderhearted, truthful and perfidious, imaginativ or dull—one man how loveable another how hateful, alike man, brutal or divine. Whereamong hath the sceptic honourable place, thatt old iconoclast who coud destroy the gods soon as men made them, vain imagery and unworthy, low symbols of the Eternal that standeth unchanged. Like some medicinal root in pharmacy, whose juice is wholesom for purgation,—so is he—and if Truth be thatt which Omniscience would assert of all things, we may grant him his motto “Truth is not for man”. But from his sleepy castle he wil be tempted forth if ever a hunting horn echo in the woods around, for he loveth the chase, and, like a good sportsman, his hounds and his weapons as he loveth the prey. So musing all my days with unceasing wonder and encountering many phases of many minds, thru' kindly environment of my disposition I grew, as all things grow, in the pattern of Self; til stumbling early upon the mystic words, whereby —in the Semitic matrix of my father's creed— Jahveh reveal'd his secret Being to the Jews, and conning those large letters I AM THAT I AM I wonder'd finding only my own thought of myself, and reading there that man was made in God's image knew not yet that God was made in the image of man; nor the profounder truth that both these truths are one, no quibbling scoff—for surely as mind in man groweth so with his manhood groweth his idea of God, wider ever and worthier, untill it may contain and reconcile in reason all wisdom passion and love, and bring at last (may God so grant) Christ's Peace on Earth. Nor coud it ever dwell in my possible thought that whatsoever grew and groweth can be unlike in cause and substance to the thing it groweth on: Thus I saw Conscience as a natural flower-bud on its vigorous plant specialized to a function marvelously, a blossom first unique in design of beauty, in colour and form, thickening therefrom to a fruit productiv to infinit regeneration; and yet this bud—as any primer of botany can teach— is but a differentiation of the infertile leaf, which held all this miracle in intrinsic potence. Thus science would teach, and Heraclitus, I say, was not the least among the sages of Hellas, Nor those fire-worshippers foolish who, seeing the Sun to be the efficient cause of all life upon earth, welcomed his full effulgence for their symbol of God. And since we observe in all existence four stages— Atomic, Organic, Sensuous, and Self conscient— and must conceive these in gradation, it was no flaw in Leibnitz to endow his monad-atoms with Mind: tho' in our schools of thought “unconscious mind” is call'd a contradiction in terms; as if the embranglements of logic wer the prime condition of all Being, the essence of things; and man in the toilsom journey from conscience of nothing to conscient ignorance mistook his tottery crutch for the main organ of life. 'Tis laughable that man should fondle such surprise at animal behaviour, seeing some beetle or fly —whose very existence is so negligible and brief— act more intelligently than he might himself had he been there to advise with all his pros and cons, his cause, effect and means: Such conduct he wil style “Marvels of Instinct”, but what sort of wisdom is this that mistaketh the exception for the general rule and the rule for the exception? Since the animal world immeasurably outnumbereth the species of man, and wholly is ruled by Instinct: 'Tis the Reason of man that is the exception and marvel; nay, 'tis plain to see how, as our Life is animal so also our conduct is mainly instinctiv, while pure Reason left to herself relieth on axioms and essential premises which she can neither question nor resolve, things far beyond her, holding her anchor in eternal Mind, characteristic universals, the firm rock whereon her lofty watch-towers are planted, and all her star-gazing observatories built. Wise thinkers do homage to good fellow-thinkers, nor disregard the general commonsense of man —that untouch'd photograph of external Nature self-pictur'd for us nakedly on her own mirror:— and tho' common opinion may be assent in error ther is little or none accord in philosophic thought: this picklock Reason is still a-fumbling at the wards, bragging to unlock the door of stern Reality. Ask what is reasonable! See how time and clime conform mind more than body in their environment; what then and there was Reason, is here and now absurd; what I now chance to approve, may be or become to others strange and unpalatable as now appear to me the weighty sentences of the angelic Doctor: For I rank it among the unimaginables how Saint Thomas, with all his honesty and keen thought, toiling to found an irrefragable system of metaphysic, ethic and theologic truth, should with open eyes have accepted for main premiss the myth of a divine fiasco, on which to assure the wisdom of God; leading to a foregon conclusion of illachrymable logic, a monstrous scheme horrendum informe ingens cui Lumen ademptum. Some would say that the Saint himself held not the faith which universal credit compell'd him to assume if he would lead and teach the Church: But so to think (as tho' 'twas but the best gambit to open his game) wer to his acumen and his honesty alike unjust. I am happier in surmising that his vision at Mass —in Naples it was when he fell suddenly in trance— was some disenthralment of his humanity; for thereafter, whether 'twer Aristotle or Christ that had appear'd to him then, he nevermore wrote word neither dictated but laid by inkhorn and pen; and was as a man out of hearing on thatt day when Reynaldus, with all the importunity of zeal and intimacy of friendship, would hav recall'd him to his incompleted summa; and sighing he reply'd I wil tell thee a secret, my son, constraining thee lest thou dare impart it to any man while I liv. My writing is at end. I hav seen such things reveal'd that what I hav written and taught seemeth to me of small worth. And hence I hope in my God, that, as of doctrin ther wil be speedily also an end of Life! THER is no tradition among the lemmings of Norway how their progenitors, when their offspring increased, bravely forsook their crowded nestes in the snow, swarming upon the plains to ravage field and farm, and in unswerving course ate their way to the coast, where plunging down the rocks they swam in the salt sea to drowning death; nor hav they in acting thus today any plan for their journey or prospect in the event. But clerks and chroniclers wer many in Christendom, when France and Germany pour'd out the rabblement of the second Crusade, and its record is writ; its leaders' titles, kings and knights of fair renown, their resolve and design: and yet for all their vows, their consecrating crosses and embroider'd flags, the eloquent preaching of Saint Bernard, and the wiles of thatt young amorous amazon, Queen Eleanòr, they wer impell'd as madly, journey'd as blindly and perish'd as miserably as the thoughtless voles, by disease starvation and massacre, or enslaved by wrath of the folk whose homes they had wreckt and ravaged; til of the unnumber'd rout a poor remnant fled back, the shame of humanity for their folly and crimes. Reason, shamefast at heart and vain above measure, would look to find the firstfruits of intelligence showing some provident correction of man's estate to'ard social order, a wise discriminat purpose in clear contrast against the blind habits of brutes: And when our honest hope turneth away repell'd by the terror and superstition of savagery —wherein nascent Reason seemeth to hav hoodwink'd Mind,— if we read but of Europe since the birth of Christ, 'tis still incompetent disorder, all a lecture of irredeemable shame; the wrongs and sufferings alike of kings and clowns are a pitiful tale. Follow the path of those fair warriors, the tall Goths, from the day when they led their blue-eyed families off Vistula's cold pasture-lands, their murky home by the amber-strewen foreshore of the Baltic sea, and in the incontaminat vigor of manliness feeling their rumour'd way to an unknown promised land, tore at the ravel'd fringes of the purple power, and trampling its wide skirts, defeating its armies, slaying its Emperor, and burning his cities, sack'd Athens and Rome; untill supplanting Caesar they ruled the world where Romans reign'd before:— Yet from those three long centuries of rapin and blood, inhumanity of heart and wanton cruelty of hand, ther is little left, save the broken relic of one good bishop, and the record of one noble king, —who both had suck'd their virtue from the wither'd dugs of learning, where she lay sickening within the walls of rich Byzance:—Those Goths wer strong but to destroy; they neither wrote nor wrought, thought not nor created; but since the field was rank with tares and mildew'd wheat, their scything won some praise: Else have they left no trace, save for their share in that rich mingled character of Hebrew, Roman, Vandal, Mussulman and Kelt, that spoke the pride of Spain, to stand for ever alive in one grandesque effigy of ennobled folly, among fair Beauty's fairest offspring unreproved. Yet for this intellectual laughter—deem it not true Wisdom's panoply. The wise will live by Faith, faith in the order of Nature and that her order is good. 'Twer scepticism in them to cherish make-believe, creeds and precise focusings of the unsearchable: at such things they may smile; yet for man's ignorance and frailty the only saving consolation is faith, the which theologians tell us is the gift of God, as other good things are, and laughter is one of them; and sharing of man's Essence 'twil be at height in him when 'tis the laughter of Reason—enjoyable; and 'tis fit that he should show Nature this courtesy, and kindly make light of all the troubles that compel no tears: —Cervantes in misfortune when a galley-slave wept not—but where sorrow is sacred humour is dumb, and in full calamity it is madness: wherefore Hamlet himself would never hav been aught to us, or we to Hamlet, wer't not for the artful balance whereby Shakespeare so gingerly put his sanity in doubt without the while confounding his Reason. And tho' desire of perfection is Nature's promise we should not in the field of Reason look to find less vary and veer than elsewhere in the flux of Life: We may rather rejoice in the great abundance, the indigenous fruitage of our gay Paradise, that Persia, China and Babylon put forth their bloom, that India and Egypt wer seedplots of wisdom. The best part of our lives we are wanderers in Romance: Our fathers travel'd Eastward to revel in wonders where pyramid pagoda and picturesque attire glow in the fading sunset of antiquity; and now wil the Orientals make hither in return outlandish pilgrimage: their wiseacres hav seen the electric light i' the West, and come to worship; tasting romance in our unsightly novelties and scientific tricks; for all things in their day may hav opinion of glory: Glory is opinion, the vain doxology wherewith man would praise God. Time eateth away at many an old delusion, yet with civilization delusions make head; the thicket of the people wil take furtiv fire from irresponsible catchwords of live ideas, sudden as a gorse-bush from the smouldering end of any loiterer's match-splint, which, unless trodden out afore it spredd, or quell'd with wieldy threshing-rods wil burn ten years of planting with all last year's ricks and blacken a countryside. 'Tis like enough that men ignorant of fire and poison should be precondemn'd to sudden deaths and burnings, but 'tis mightily to the reproach of Reason that she cannot save nor guide the herd; that minds who else wer fit to rule must win to power by flattery and pretence, and so by spiritual dishonesty in their flurried reign confirm the disrepute of all authority— but only in sackcloth can the Muse speak of such things. WISDOM hath hewed her house: She that dwelleth alway with God in the Evermore, afore any world was, fashion'd the nascent Earth that the energy of its life might come to evolution in the becoming of Man, who, as her subject, should subjéct all to her rule and bring God's latest work to be a realm of delight. So she herself, the essential Beauty of Holiness, pass'd her creativ joy into the creature's heart, to take back from his hand her Adoration robes and royal crown of his Imagination and Love. And when she had made of men lovers and worshippers, these vied to enshrine her godhead in enduring fanes and architectur of stone, that high her pensiv towers might hallow their throng'd cities and, transfeaturing Nature's wild landscape to the sovranty of Mind, comfort his mortality with immortal grace. Yet not to those colossal temples where old Nile guideth a ribbon oasis thru' the Libyan sands, depositing a kingdom from his fabled fount —like thatt twin-sister stream of slothful thought, whose flood fertilized the rude mind of Egypt—not to these, nor those Cyclopean tombs, which hieroglyphic kings uprear'd to hide their mummies from the common death, whereto their folk dragging the slow burdensome stones wer driven and fed like beasts, untill the pyramid in geometrical enormity peak'd true— 'Tis not to these—nay nor in Gizeh to thatt Sphinx, grand solitary symbol of man's double nature, with lion body couchant and with human head gazing out vainly upon the desert—not to these look we with grateful pleasur or satisfaction of soul, wonderfine tho' they be, and indestructible against sandblast of time and spoliation of man— nor tho' with sixty centuries of knowledge pass'd still those primeval sculptors shame our paltry style:— Nay ev'n so, not to these look we to find comfort; Not yet was Wisdom justified of her children. Long had the homing bees plunder'd the thymy flanks of famed Hymettus harvesting their sweet honey: agelong the dancing waves had lapp'd the Ægean isles and promontories of the blue Ionian shore —where in her Mediterranean mirror gazing old Asia's dreamy face wrinkleth to a westward smile— and the wild olive, cleft-rooted in Attica, wreath'd but the rocks, afore the wandering Aryan tribes, whose Goddess was athena, met, and in her right knew themselves lords of Hellas and the Achean land whereto they had come fighting, for their children to win heritage of Earth's empire. 'Twas their youthful tongue that Wisdom sought when her Egyptian kingdom fail'd, and choosing to be call'd Athena daughter of Zeus motion'd the marble to her living grace, and took her dwelling in the high-templed Acropolis of the fair city that still hath her name. As some perfected flower, Iris or Lily, is born patterning heavenly beauty, a pictur'd idea that hath no other expression for us, nor coud hav: for thatt which Lily or Iris tell cannot be told by poetry or by music in their secret tongues, nor is discerptible in logic, but is itself an absolute piece of Being, and we know not, nay, nor search not by what creativ miracle the soul's language is writ in perishable forms— yet are we aware of such existences crowding, mysterious beauties unexpanded, unreveal'd, phantasies intangible investing us closely, hid only from our eyes by skies that will not clear; activ presences, striving to force an entrance, like bodiless exiled souls in dumb urgence pleading to be brought to birth in our conscient existence, as if our troubled lot wer the life they long'd for; even as poor mortals thirst for immortality:— And every divination of Natur or reach of Art is nearer attainment to the divine plenitude of understanding, and in moments of Vision the unseen company is the breath of Life:— By such happy influence of their chosen goddess the mind of Hellas blossom'd with a wondrous flow'r, flaming in summer season, and in its autumn fall ripening an everlasting fruit, that in dying scatter'd its pregnant seeds into all the winds of heav'n: nor ever again hath like bloom appear'd among men. Knowledge accumulateth slowly and not in vain; with new attainment new orders of beauty arise, in thought and art new values; but man's faculties were gifted once for all and stand, 'twould seem, at stay: Ther is now no higher intellect to brighten the world than little Hellas own'd; nay scarcely here and there liveth a man among us to rival their seers. So might we fear that such implicit unity, so friendly a passionat love for nature beauty and truth, such dignity of body tender of pride and shame, such lively accord of Sense, Instinct, Reason and Spirit as gazeth down on us with alien sovranty from all their statuesque literature and art, wer a grace (so might we fear) like the grace of childhood lost in growth, a glory of the past, not to return. Such 'twer vain to deplore; since true beauty of manhood outfeatureth childish charm, and whether in men or things Best is mature; tho' Beauty is neither growth nor strength; for ugliness also groweth proudly and is strong. Well might we ask what Beauty ever coud liv or thrive in our crowded democracy under governance of such politic fancy as a farmer would show who cultivated weeds in hope of good harvest: and yet hath modern cultur enrich'd a wasting soil; Science comforting man's animal poverty and leisuring his toil, hath humanized manners and social temper, and now above her globe-spredd net of speeded intercourse hath outrun all magic, and disclosing the secrecy of the reticent air hath woven a seamless web of invisible strands spiriting the dumb inane with the quick matter of life: Now music's prison'd raptur and the drown'd voice of truth mantled in light's velocity, over land and sea are omnipresent, speaking aloud to every ear, into every heart and home their unhinder'd message, the body and soul of Universal Brotherhood; whereby war faln from savagery to fratricide, from a trumpeting vainglory to a crying shame, stalketh now with blasting curse branded on its brow. And if the Greek Muses wer a graceful company yet hav we two, that in maturity transcend the promise of their baby-prattle in Time's cradle, Musick and Mathematick: coud their wet-nurses but see these foster-children upgrown in full stature, Pythagoras would marvel and Athena rejoice. And ev'n to Apollo's choir was a rich voice lacking in the great symphonies of the poetic throng who beneath Homer's crown enroll'd immortal names; for without later names the full compass of song had been unknown to man—nay and some English names, whose younger voices in the imagination of love swell'd to spiritual ecstasy, and emotion'd life with mystic inspiration of new lyric rapture: and 'twas the first alluring gleam of thatt vision that stole by virtue of novelty the world away from the philosophic concinnity of Greek art, to abjure the severe ordering of its antique folds. In love of fleshly prowess Hellas overesteem'd the nobility of passion and of animal strength, and the acclamation of their Olymic games outfaced spiritual combat;—as their forefathers wer they, those old seapirates, who with roving robbery built up their island lordships on the ruin of Crete, when the unforbearing rivalry of their free cities wreck'd their confederacy within the sevenscore years 'twixt Marathon and Issus; untill from the pride of routing Xerxes and his fabulous host, they fell to make that most memorable of all invasions less memorable in the glory of Alexander, under whose alien kingship they conspired to outreach their own ambition, winning dominions too wide for domination; and wer, with their virtue, dispersed and molten into the great stiffening alloy of Rome. So it was when Jesus came in his gentleness with his divine compassion and great Gospel of Peace, men hail'd him word of god, and in the title of Christ crown'd him with love beyond all earth-names of renown. For He, wandering unarm'd save by the Spirit's flame, in few years with few friends founded a world-empire wider than Alexander's and more enduring; since from his death it took its everlasting life. his kingdom is God's kingdom, and his holy temple not in Athens or Rome but in the heart of man. They who understand not cannot forget, and they who keep not his commandment call him Master and Lord. He preach'd once to the herd, but now calleth the wise, and shall in his second Advent, that tarried long, be glorified by the Greeks that come to the feast: But the great Light shineth in great darkness, the seed that fell by the wayside hath been trodden under foot, that which fell on the Rock is nigh wither'd away; While loud and louder thro' the dazed head of the sphinx the old lion's voice roareth o'er all the lands. BOOK II SELFHOOD The vision of the seer who saw the Spirit of Man. A chariot he beheld speeding twixt earth and heaven drawn by wing'd horses, and the charioteer thereon upright with eyes upon the goal and mind alert controlling his strong steeds, that spurn'd the drifted cloud as now they sank now mounted in their heav'nward flight. Thus Plato recordeth—how Socrates told it to Phædrus on a summer morning, as they sat beneath a lofty plane-tree by the grassy banks of the Ilissus, talking of the passions of men. The Vision of the Seer is Truth's Apocalypse, yet needeth for our aid a true interpreter. The names of the two horses are selfhood and breed, the charioteer is reason, and the whip in his hand is not to urge-on the steeds nor to incite their blood; their mettle is everlasting and they need no goad: He wieldeth it to make them ware of his presence and hold them obedient to the rein of his Will. But this picture drafted in Mind's creativ cave, and thence on the eye projected, thin is as the film of colour and shade on a canvas, ther is nought beneath: it telleth not who bred those wild horses, or broke their strong necks to the yoke, nor who builded the car, and harness'd them therto for its high heavenly flight; nor how reason ever mounted it in full career and took the reins, nor of what stuff intangible they are woven, those reins pictured so taut in his grasp; nay, for not he himself kenneth well of these things: Yet truly is he portray'd fearless and glad of heart, his lash circling o'erhead, as smiling on his steeds he speaketh to them lovingly in his praise or blame. Now these two horses, without which the wheels of Life would never hav had motion, and with them can hav no rest, are the animal instincts in the birthright of man; nor are they, as Plato fancied, one evil and one good: both are good, but of their wildness they are restiv both and wilful, nor wil yield mastery, unless they feel the hand of expert manage and good horsemanship. Selfhood is the elder and stronger; but Breed, once her foal is livelier and of limb finer and more mettlesome, her rival now, and both wil pull together as one. 'Tis first to tell of Selfhood, since the first one thing, if ever a first thing wer, was of the Essence of Self. Consider a plant—its life—how a seed faln to ground sucketh in moisture for its germinating cells, and as it sucketh swelleth, til it burst its case and thrusting its roots downward and spreading them wide taketh tenure of the soil, and from ev'ry raindrop on its dribbling passage to replenish the springs plundereth the freighted salt, while it pricketh upright with its flagstaff o'erhead for a place in the sun, anon to disengage buds that in tender leaves unfolding may inhale provender of the ambient air: and, tentacles or tendrils, they search not blindly but each one headeth straightly for its readiest prey; and haply, if the seed be faln in a place of darkness roof'd in by men—if ther should be any ray or gleam how faint soe'er, 'twil crane and reach its pallid stalk into the crevice, pushing ev'n to disrupt the stones. 'Tis of such absolute selfhood that it knoweth not parent nor offspring, and will abuse advantage of primogeniture, with long luxuriant boughs crowding in vain-glory to overshadow and quell its younger brethren; while, as for its own children that, cradled on its branches, fell from its fruitage, 'twil choke them when they strive to draw life at its feet. Look now upon a child of man when born to light, how otherwise than a plant sucketh he and clutcheth? how with his first life-breath he clarioneth for food! craving as the blind fledgelings in a thrush's nest that perk their naked necks, stiff as a chimney-stack. food-funnels, like as hoppers in a corn-mill gaping for what supply the feeder may shovel in their throats. How differeth the new-born child from plant or fledgeling? Among low organisms some are call'd animal for being unrooted, else inseparable from plants; yet each in his small motion is as a lion on prowl, or as a python gliding to seize and devour some weaker Self, whereby to fortify his own. And if Selfhood thus rule thru'out organic life 'tis no far thought that all the dumb activities in atom or molecule are like phenomena of individuat Selfhood in its first degrees. This Autarchy of Selfhood, which we blame not at all in plants and scarcely in brutes, is by Reason denounced heartless, and outlaw'd from the noble temper of man, the original sin and cause of half his woes and shames; whence Natur again would seem at variance with herself, misdoubting the foundation whereon she had built all, and seeing too late the fault threating to split her house would buttress it with the outwork of an afterthought. But tho 'tis only Reason can govern this horse, correction awaited not the human charioteer; Selfhood had of itself begotten its own restraint— like as small plague-microbes generate their own toxin in antidote of their own mischief (so 'tis said): Even among beasts of prey the bloody wolves, who found some selfish betterment from their hunting in packs, had thereby learn'd submission to a controlling will, their leader being so far charioteer of their rage; while pastoral animals, or ever a drover came to pen them for his profit, had in self-defence herded together; and on the wild prairies are seen when threaten'd by attack, congregating their young within their midst for safety, and then serrying their ranks in a front line compact to face the dreaded foe. And this parental instinct, tho' it own cousinship with Breed, was born of Selfhood. A nursing mammal, since she must feel her suckling a piece of herself, wil self-preserve and shelter it as herself; and oft 'tis hard to wean. So birds, by long brooding inured, wil watch their chickens heedfully, and fearfully attend their early excursions, guiding aiding and at need defending against danger. It is pretty to mark a partridge, when she hath first led forth her brood to run among the grass-tussocks or hay-stubbles of June, if man or beast approach them, how to usurp regard she counterfeiteth the terror of a wounded bird draggling a broken wing, and noisily enticeth or provoketh the foe to follow her in a vain chase; nor wil she desist from the ruse of her courage to effect her own escape in loud masterful flight, untill she hav far decoy'd hunter or blundering hoof from where she has bid her little ones to scatter and hide. In man this blind motherly attachment is the spring of his purest affection, and of all compassion,— the emotion most inimical to war: I deem its form of unimpeachable sincerity to be the mould wherein Friendship's full faith is cast. But richest fruits are tardy in ripening, and man's mind on the last topmost branch, fed from the deepest root, struggleth slowly to birth thru' long-enforced delay. See nature's habit now devolving upon man, and in his Reason her patience as virtue reborn. First wil be many months of bodily helplessness, then many years ere the fine budding spirit unclose. Wherewhile a new spiritual personality in its miraculous significance, the child is less the mother's own than a treasur entrusted, which she can never love too fondly or serve too well; Nay, rather is she possess'd by her own possession, and in her Vita nuova such things are reveal'd that all she hath thought or done seemeth to her of small worth. The unfathomable mystery of her awaken'd joy sendeth her daily to heaven on her knees in prayer: and watching o'er the charm of a soul's wondering dawn enamoureth so her spirit, that all her happiness is in her care for him, all hope in his promise; and his nobility is the dream-goal of her life. In the sunshine of her devotion, her peace and joy are mirror'd in the child's mind, and would leave thereon no place for sin, coud all be purified to attain; but in the most the mind is gross and the spirit bleak; and for a generation needing an outward sign of this transcendent mystery, 'twas well when Art fashioning a domestic symbol in worship of Christ pictured him as an infant in his Mother's arms, sharing with her his suffering and glory—it was well: Nor count I any scripture to be better inspired with eternal wisdom or by insight of man than the four words wherewith the sad penitent hymn calleth aloud on Mary standing neath the cross: eia mater, it saith, mater fons amoris. Leave Selfhood now in her fond sanctuary awhile with the unseen universe communing and entranced strangely:—As when a high moon thru' the rifted wrack gleameth upon the random of the windswept night; or as a sunbeam softly, on early worshippers at some rich shrine kneeling, stealeth thru' the eastern apse and on the clouded incense and the fresco'd walls mantleth the hush of prayer with a vaster silence, laden as 'twer with the unheard music of the spheres; —nay, incommunicable and beyond all compare are the rich influences of those moments of bliss, mocking imagination or pictured remembrance, as a divine dream in the vaulted slumber of life. Leave we Selfhood now secretly under thatt nimbus, fashioning by nurtur in a new selfhood of spirit whatever in the redemption of beauty and dignity ennobleth the society or the person of man— leave thatt nursery awhile, and ask how Nature wrought where she with-held from life the gift of Motherhood. The teeming progeny of such egg-breeding insects as multiply their children a thousandfold a day must lie close on the zero of parental bondage; nor can they be debar'd by ignominy of rank or unlikeness of kind from vouching in this case: For among Bees and Ants are social systems found so complex and well-order'd as to invite offhand a pleasant fable enough: that once upon a time, or ever a man was born to rob their honeypots, bees wer fully endow'd with Reason and only lost it by ordering so their life as to dispense with it; whereby it pined away and perish'd of disuse, which, whether it wer or no, if men can judge of Bees, well might be in their strange manner of life—so like it is with what our economical bee-minded men teach as the first intelligential principle of human government welfare and happiness;— Nay, some I hav seen wil choose a beehive for their sign and gloss their soul-delusion with a muddled thought, picturing a skep of straw, the beekeeper's device, a millowner's workshop, for totem of their tribe; Not knowing the high goal of our great endeavour is spiritual attainment, individual worth, at all cost to be sought and at all cost pursued, to be won at all cost and at all cost assured, not such material ease as might be attain'd for all by cheap production and distribution of common needs, wer all life level'd down to where the lowest can reach: Thus generating for ever in his crowded treadmills, man's life wer cheap as bees'; and we may see in them how he likewise might liv, if each would undertake the maximum of toil that is found tolerable upon a day-doled minimum of sustenance; and stay from procrëation at that just number of men, hard-workers and small-eaters, who coud crowd on earth under the shadow of this skeleton of happiness. And since life must lose value in diminution of goods, life-time must also itself be in due proportion abredged; and both diminishings must at some point be stay'd, lest by slow loss they come dwindling in the end to nought: then, when to each single life the allotted span is fix'd, the system wil be at balance, stable and perfected. The ground-root folly of this pitous philanthropy is thinking to distribute indivisibles, and make equality in things incommensurable: forged under such delusions, all Utopias are castles in the air or counsels of despair. So Plato, on whose infant lips—as it is told— bees settled where he lay slumbering in his cradle, and honour'd with their augury man's loan of praise— ev'n Plato, when he in fear and mistrust of Selfhood denyeth family life to his republicans, fell, bruized; tho' cautiously depicting Socrates reluctant to disclose the offensiv absurdum of his pretentious premiss—when, being forced to admit that in his free community of women and children no child would ken its parent, no parent his child, he sought to twist the bull's horns with a sophistry— arguing that mother's love and home-life being the source of such inestimable good, 'twer wise that law should forbid privat property in their benefits: Nay, so 'twould set his state above all other states, wer suchlike indispensable privileges rescued from ownership, and for the general use distributed equally among the citizens. For surely (said he) a bastard nursed in a bureau must love and reverence all women for its mothers; and likewise every woman, being in like default, would love all babies as her only son. May-be Plato was pleased to launch his whole Utopia safely in absolute dreamland; but poor Socrates, on whom he father'd it, was left in nubibus where Aristophanes in good jest had set him some twenty years afore: and our sophists, who lack claim to any shred of great Plato's glorious mantle of wisdom, have secured a good lien on his bluff. But yet to read the strange riddle of the hiving bees, their altruism and platonesque intelligence, 'tis enough to suppose that their small separat selves are function'd by the same organic socialism and vital telepathy as the corpuscles are whereof their little bodies are themselves composed: that this cell-habit, spredd thru'out to a general sense, inspireth them in their corporate community. Consider the tiny egg-cell whence the man groweth, how it proliferateth freely, as a queen-bee doth, and more surely than any animal or plant breedeth; how each new offspring cell is for some special work differentiated and functioneth spontaneously, and ev'n wil change its predetermin'd faculty when accidental environment maketh a call, leaving its proper sphere to amend what hath gone wrong: Consider then their task, those unimaginable infinit co-adaptations of function'd tissue correlated delicately in a ravel'd web of unknown sensibilities . . . how 'tis a task incomparable in complexity with whatsoe'er the bees can boast: nor do the unshapely cells behave with lesser show of will, nor of purpose and skill: Pass by the rarer achievements, yea, forget all fames, all works all art all virtue and knowledge—set them by, and still the solved problems must exhaust our wonder; Reason can bring no more; and it addeth nothing that the complete insect should in some part possess some of the faculties of its constituent cells. Or if this thing be deem'd in Natur anomalous, that perfect organisms with sense and motion endow'd should still behave to each other as link'd constructiv cells, yet outwardly to our eyes this freedom affordeth machinery wherupon common purpose can work: To the insect, order and disorder are exposed to sight; and so we think to see the little emmets confer and locking their antennæ immediately transmit the instinctiv calls which each and all can feel, whereas the mutual fellowship of distributed cells hath so confounded thought that explanation is fetch'd from chemic agency: because in that science the reaction of unknown forces is described and summ'd in mathematic formulæ pregnant of truth, and of such universal scope that, being call'd laws, their mere description passeth for Efficient Cause. Sometimes when slowly from the deep sleep of fatigue a man awakeneth, he lyeth for awhile amazed, aware of self and of his rested body, and yet knowing not where he is, bewilder'd, unable to interpret sight or sound, because the slumbering guards in Memory's Castle hav lagg'd at his summons for to let down the drawbridge and to uplift the gate: Anon with their deliverance he cometh again to usual cognisance of the things about him, life, and all his old familiar concepts of home. So 'tis with any Manchild born into the world, so wondereth he awhile at the stuff of his home, so, tho' slowly and unconsciently, he remembereth.— The senses ministrant on his apperception are predisposed to the terrestrial influences, adapted to the environment where they took shape: With ease of long habit his lungs inhale the air, his eyes and skin welcome the sun, and his palate findeth assurance taking to the mother's milk: His muffling wraps, his frill'd and closely curtain'd cot and silken apparel of wealth are stranger things to him than the rough contacts wherefrom they are thought to shield him, the everlasting companionships of his lang syne; nor later wil he meet with any older acquaintance than Bees are; for his ancestors ere they wer men had pillaged the wild combs, and thru' untold ages hive-honey in cave and palace hath sweeten'd man's food: not all the flooding syrup from the East-Indian cane foster'd in the Antilles, Ohio and Illinois, in Java, Demerara or Jamaica can drown Hybla's renown, nor cheapen the honey of Narbonne: A jar of Hymettan from a scholar in Athens regaled our English laurel above all gifts to me, who hav come to wiser affection in my regard for bees, learning the secret purpose wherefor Nature plann'd their industry, and controll'd its fashion to subserve the beauty and fertility of her vegetant life, to enrich her blooms with colour and fructify her fruits, —which never a bee can guess, nor that the unwholesomeness of mixy pollen (a thing that so concerneth bees) was by the flowers contrived for their own benefit:— Nay, whether it be in the gay apple-orchards of May, when the pink bunches spread their gold hearts to the sun, nor yet rude winds hav snow'd their petals to the ground; or when a dizzy bourdon haunteth the sweet cymes that droop at Lammas-tide the queenly foliage of a tall linden tree, where yearly by the wall of some long-ruin'd Abbey she remembereth her of glad thanksgivings and the gay choral Sabbaths, while in her leafy tower the languorous murmur floateth off heav'nward in a mellow dome of shade;— or when, tho' summer hath o'erbrim'd their clammy cells the shorten'd days are shadow'd with dark fears of dearth, bees ply the more, issuing on sultry noons to throng in the ivy-blooms—what time October's flaming hues surcharge the brooding hours, till passionat soul and sense blend in a rich reverie with the dying year;— when and wherever bees are busy, it is the flowers dispense their daily task and determin its field; the prime motiv, may-hap, of all bee-energy, as of bee-industry they are surely the whole stuff. Unwitting tho' it is, this great labor of love in such kindly intimacy with nature's workings hath a genial beauty, the charm whereof lacketh to the hireling drudgery of our huge city hives. So for their happy demeanour and sweet ministry they wer ever admired of man, and won immortal place in divine story and in poetic fable and rhyme: Deem'd heavenly visitants wer they, children of the air of no earthly engendering, under celestial laws living a life of wisdom pleasur and diligence, a model for the polity and society of men. Alas, we hav seen too near the poor life of the Bee, how of the swarming workers that cluster'd to found the springtide colony and project its waxen walls not one liveth to sing her nisi Dominus, nor to rest from her labour, nor to enjoy the fruits. Forty days, six unsabbath'd weeks of fever'd toil wasteth and wearieth out their little frames—in truth their eggs wer a mass-product, not design'd to endure, nor for themselves, but pennywise to serve a turn:— One by one they succumb on their lonely journeys, o'erladen above their strength, benighted or astray, entrapp'd by swooping beaks, or by hard hail laid low with broken wings, untill a frail remnant at last wearily welcoming the dim prescience of death seek their own cemetery, where their shriveling skins may lie together apart nor soil the hive; yet still ever and ever as they fail, perish and disappear, new shifts of younger workers, born of later eggs, take-up the unresting labour, each in their turn content to keep hive clean, eggs plenty, and storeroom full. Thus passeth summer, and with her draggled pageantry they too giv o'er, and stay all business in the hive, and huddling upon the foodstore in their dark den by numb stagnation husband the low flicker of life, sustain'd by an unheard promise that their prison again shall feel the sun, and they with the brave buds of March shall drink the valiance of his steepening rays, they too be hearten'd to revive, and venturing forth renew the well-worn round of toil; wherein ther is no one point of true accomplishment, since the sweet honeycomb for which man thanketh them, is but their furnishment, the larder and nursery and provisional shelter wherein their forlorn hope, their last shift may hold out thru' the long sleepless night of winter's starving gloom. And for their monarch Queen—an egg-casting machine, helpless without attendance as a farmer's drill, by bedels driven and gear'd and in the furrows steer'd, well-watch'd the while, and treated with respect and care so long as she run well, oil'd stoked and kept in trim; but if deranged she slacken in her depositing, she is dealt with as men scrap a worn-out seed-barrow, not worth the mending; new machines cost nought to bees. Now when this story is with man's tender sentiment foolishly travestied, Nature wil seem malign: But bees—unless the Selfhood of the hive can feel— lack conscience of emotion, or hav no more than when, call'd by the sun to swarm in a bright morn of May, their agitated clamour and frolic flight would shew that some levity hath prick'd their cores: even as with us who feel the exhilaration of the voluptuous air that surgeth in our flesh to flood the soul, and ease our stiff behaviour; and to such happy influences swarming bees are responsiv and forget to sting: in which, as in their stranger mockeries of mankind, they are truly less like us than we are like to them. So all barbaric tyrants, who secure their throne by murder of rivals, hav their model in the Queen-bee; and the class-hate that kindleth in disorder'd times, when prosperity hath set envy and desire at war— 'tis like the workers' annual massacre of the Drones: And even if some faint rebel mote of pleasure lurk in these fly-puppetries of human crime, 'tis plain that bees in their short life can hav so little joy and so much toil,—I say 'tis plain, that (if the things be comparable) then with the beehive compared the New-world slave-plantations wer abodes of bliss. Me-seemeth in my poem these poor hive-bees fare as with an old black bear that hath climb'd on their tree in the American Adirondacks or Asian Himalya, and clawing their comb, eateth it in, grubs, bees and honey and all: it is all one to him, for the brute is omnivorous and hath a sweet tooth. Conscient Reason, the channel of man's spiritual joy, hath such dominant function also in bodily feeling that 'tis the measur of suffering in all animals, in lower forms negligible, and in the lowest pain can be felt no more than mid the dancing waves a pleasure-boat feeleth the hand on her tiller that keepeth-up her head to th'wind and her sails full. And of spiritual pain the most cometh again thru' Reason, whether of frailty or of imperfection:— Savagery hath the throes; and ah! in tender years the mind of childhood knoweth torments of terror, fears incommunicable, unconsolable, vague shapes; tho' oft they be the dread boding of truth, against which man's full Reason at grips may wrestle in vain. Yet for the gift of his virgin intelligence a child is ever our nearest pictur of happiness: 'tis a delight to look on him in tireless play attentively occupied with a world of wonders, so rich in toys and playthings that naked Nature wer enough without the marvelous inventary of man; wherewith he toyeth no less, and learning soon the lore of cypher and alphabet anon getteth to con the fair uncial comment that science hath penn'd glossing the mazy hieroglyph of Nature's book; and as he ever drinketh of the living waters his spirit is drawn into the stream and, as a drop commingled therewith, taketh of birthright therein as vast an heritage as his young body hath in the immemorial riches of mortality. And now full light of heart he hath willingly pass'd out thru' the sword-gates of Eden into the world beyond: He wil be child no more: in his revel of knowledge all the world is his own: all the hope of mankind is sharpen'd to a spearpoint in his bright confidence, as he rideth forth to do battle, a Chevalier in the joyous travail of the everlasting dawn: There is nought to compare then, truly nought to compare: and wer not Fortune fickle in her lovingkindness, all wer well with a man—for his life is at flower, nor hath he any fear: ????? ??????? ??? ????????????? ?? ?? ???? ???????? But since her favor is inscrutable and uncertain, and of her multiplicity she troubleth not at the interaction of diverse self-consequences, ther wil be blastings and blightings of hope and love, and rude shocks that affray; yet to the enamour'd soul evil is irrelevant and will be brush'd aside: rather 'tis as with Art, wherein special beauty springeth of obstacles that hav been overcome and to graces transform'd; so the lover in life will make obstructions serve, and from all resistance gain strength: his reconcilement with suffering is eased by fellow-suffering, and in pride of his calling good warriorship welcometh the challenge of death. Beneath the spaceless dome of the soul's firmament he liveth in the glow of a celestial fire, fed by whose timeless beams our small obedient sun is as a cast-off satellite, that borroweth from the great Mover of all; and in the light of light man's little works, strewn on the sands of time, sparkle like cut jewels in the beatitude of God's countenance. But heav'nward tho' the chariot be already mounted, 'tis Faith alone can keep the charioteer in heart— Nay, be he but irresolute the steeds wil rebel, and if he looketh earthward they wil follow his gaze; and ever as to earth he neareth, and vision cleareth of all that he feareth, and the enemy appeareth waving triumphant banners on the strongholds of ill, his mirroring mind wil tarnish, and mortal despair possess his soul: then surely Nature hath no night dark as that black darkness that can be felt: no storm blind as the fury of Man's self-destructiv passions, no pestilence so poisonous as his hideous sins. Thus men in slavery of sorrow imagin ghastly creeds, monstrous devilry, abstractions of terror, and wil look to death's benumbing opium as their only cure, or, seeking proudly to ennoble melancholy by embracement, wil make a last wisdom of woe: They lie in Hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them; whose prophet sage and preacher is the old Ecclesiast pseudo-Solomon, who cryeth in the wilderness, calling all to baptism in the Slough of Despond: vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas. THE Spartan General Brasidas, the strenuous man, who earn'd historic favour from his conquer'd foe, once caught a mouse foraging in his messbasket among the figs, but when it bit him let it go, praising its show of fight in words that Plutarch judged worth treasuring; and since I redd the story at school unto this hour I hav never thought of Brasidas and cannot hear his name, but that I straightway see a table and an arm'd man smiling with hand outstretch'd above a little mouse that is scampering away. Why should this thing so hold me? and why do I welcome now the tiny beast, that hath come running up to me as if here in my cantos he had spied a crevice, and counting on my friendship would make it his home? 'Tis such a pictur as must by mere beauty of fitness convince natural feeling with added comfort. The soldier seeth the instinct of Selfhood in the mouse to be the same impulse that maketh virtue in him. For Brasidas held that courage ennobleth man, and from unworth redeemeth, and that folk who shrink from ventur of battle in self-defence are thereby doom'd to slavery and extinction: and so this mouse, albeit its little teeth had done him a petty hurt, deserved liberty for its courage, and found grace in man. I had disliked Brasidas if he had kill'd the mouse: needless taking of life putteth Reason to shame, and men so startle at bloodshed that all homicide may to a purist seem mortal pollution of soul; a mystical horror of it may rule in him so strong, that rather than be slayer he would himself be slain: But fatherhood dispenseth with this vain taboo: the duty of mightiness is to protect the weak: and since slackness in duty is unto noble minds a greater shame and blame than any chance offence ensuing on right conduct, this hath my assent,— that where ther is any savagery ther wil be war: the warrior therefore needeth no apology. Children, for all their innocency and gentleness, in their unreason'd Selfhood think no scorn of war, but practise mimicry of it in their merry games, like puppies that would learn their fighting tricks betimes; and a Duke's well-bred cubs win romantic escape from their palatial mansion, hiding in the woods where they may scream and weave their raw wigwams, and don the feathery tinsel and warpaint of the Cherokees. My little chorister, who never miss'd a note,— I mark'd him how when prayers wer ended he would take his Bible, and in his corner ensconced would sit and read with unassumed devotion. What was it fetch'd him? Matthew Mark Luke and John was it? The parables, the poetry and passion of Christ? Nay 'twas the bloody books of Jewish war, the story of their Judges and Kings; lured by those braggart annals, while he conn'd the page the parson's mild discourse pass'd o'er his head unheard. For Coverdale in his grand English truly built a temple fair as thatt Ionic fane, wherein neath his nine-column'd portico of all history Herodotus sitteth statued; and like the Jew the naive Greek chronicler discovereth God's purpose guiding his chosen race to terrestrial glory. Nor hath any other nation any better argument, whether it be forged or filch'd, invented or stolen; and their historians all are as children in this, and eagerly from battlefield to battlefield jaunt on their prancing pens after their man of war, who carveth the Earth into new kingdoms, as a cake is sliced for grabbing school-boys at a teaparty: and in their exaltation of dread and derringdo, prowess is magnified and cruelty condoned; whence smaller nations, as the Portuguese, require to multiply tenfold the tale of combatants, ere they deem any event worthy of their pictured pride. Parisian vanity reposeth thus today on Buonaparte's fame; for Alexander and he are kings of kings and lords of lords, the conquerors of conquerors all; dwarfing rude rivals whensoe'er, Alaric, Tamurlane, Attila and Zingis Khan, once names of terror and furious bombast, foremost men humbled, as wer the seventy kings who with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, finger'd the crumbs beneath Adonibezek's table, untill Jew Simeon came and did the same by him to my chorister's joy. And since all earthly Empire hath taken origin from bloody invasion, man for himself would fashion his sanction and examplar in the kingdom of heav'n; Thus legendary Titans, swarming from chaos to exalt the glory of Zeus, barricaded his throne, uprooting mountains in gigantic rebellion. So hath the Church utter'd like false moneys for Christ with Godhead's image stamp'd, and pass'd it on the folk who, shadow'd in the murk of vulgar vainglories, wil prick their ears to hear how “Ther was war in Heav'n, and Michael and his Angels (like knights of romance) fought with the Dragon”: tho' Almight hath nought to gain, and by sovran oppression exalteth only his foe in tragic sympathy, as with Milton's great devil, against infinit odds confronting undismay'd inevitable ruin; or old Methusalah who when the flood rose higher swam from peak to peak til, with the last wild beasts tamed in their fear, he sat watching the whelm of water on topmost Everest, as thatt too was submerged; while in his crowded ark Noah rode safely by: and sailors caught by storm on the wide Indian Ocean at shift of the monsoon, hav seen in the dark night a giant swimmer's head that on the sequent billows trailing silvery hair at every lightning flash reappeareth in place, out-riding the tempest, as a weather-bound barque anchor'd in open roadstead lifteth at the seas. And Poetry in her task of adorning spirit, trustful also and faithful to the instincts of man, honoureth ever the steeds above the charioteer. She once would favour Selfhood, but 'tis now the foal; and learning sapphic languor in the labour of love, the Muse hath doff'd her armour for a silken robe: yet in her swooning luxury she hath never match'd nor disthroned bearded Homer's great epic of war; altho' thatt siege of Troy was in the beginning wrath and concupiscence, and in the end thereof tragedy so tearful that no mind can approve, nor any gentle heart take comfort in the event. But these and all old tales of far-off things, bygones of long-ago whereof memory still holdeth shape, Time and the Muse hav purged of their unhappiness; with their bright broken beauty they pervade the abyss, peopling the Solitude with gorgeous presences: as those bare lofty columns, time-whiten'd relics of Atlanteän adoration, upstanding lone in Baalbec or Palmyra, proudly affront the waste and with rich thought atone the melancholy of doom. Yet since of all, whatever hath once been, evil or good, tho' we can think not of it and remember it not, nothing can wholly perish; so ther is no birthright so noble or stock so clean, but it transmitteth dregs, contamination at core of old brutality; inchoate lobes, dumb shapes of ancient terror abide: tho' fading still in the oceanic deeps of mind their eyeless sorrows haunt the unfathom'd density, dulling the crystal lens of prophetic vision, crippling the nerve that ministereth to trembling strength, distorting the features of our nobility: And we, living at prime, what is it now to us how our forefathers dream'd, suffer'd, struggled, or wrought? how thru' the obliterated æons of man's ordeal unnumber'd personalities separatly endured? Think not to explore, estimate and accumulate those infinit dark happenings into a single view that might affect feeling with true judgment of thought: Imagination, that would set science that task, is as the astronomer who, with peduncled eye screw'd here or there at some minutest angle-space of the wide heav'ns, thinketh by piecemeal reckoning to pictur and comprehend the illimitable worlds thronging eternity; his highest fantasy is like an athlete's dream that he hath lept off the globe, when all his waking power is to jump-up and fall the height of his own head—all that the best can do. Wer it not then well to enquire of Reason, ere we admit her condemnation of War, seeing it so firmly entrench'd in the immemorial practice and good favour of man, whence hath she fetch'd her high authority, her right of spiritual judgment? whence then cometh wisdom? But I was anger'd with myself to hav said this thing, seeing that my thought had wander'd; for Reason reply'd “This question is wrongly ask'd. Who is it that putteth “this question into my mouth, and biddeth me answer him?— “I who hav never doubted of my authority, “who am the consciousness of things judging themselves— “Hav I not learn'd that Selfhood is fundamental “and universal in all individual Being; “and that thru' Motherhood it came in animals “to altruistic feeling, and thence-after in men “rose to spiritual affection? What then am I “in my conscience of self but very consciousness “of spiritual affection upgrown to life in me? “Truly inscrutable and dark is the Wisdom of God, “but no man cometh unto wisdom but by me.” Then was I shamed: but still my thought went harking back on its old trail, whence Reason learn'd its troublous task to comprehend aright and wisely harmonise the speechless intuitions of the inconscient mind; which, though a naked babe (as men best pictured Christ) is yet in some sort nearer to the Omniscient than man's unperfect Reason, baulk'd as thatt must be by the self-puzzledom of introspection and doubt. Thatt dark mind with its potency is the stuff of life, nature's immutable provision: in some maybe, stagnant and poor, in some activ and rich, in each a given unique quantum of personality, a loan of so-much (as 'tis writ to one he gave five talents, to another two and to another one); a treasure that can be to good fortune assured by Reason, its determinant and inexplicable coefficient, that varieth also in power and worth. For I think not of Reason as men thought of Adam, created fullgrown, perfect in the image of God; but as a helpless nursling of animal mind, as a boy with his mother, unto whom he oweth more than he ever kenneth or stayeth to think, language, knowledge, grace, love and those ideal aims whereby his manly intelligence cometh to walk alone. But how, in this independence and pride, I ask, how can this younger born stand off so far apart, clear of all else, that by the mere conscience of things he can be judge of all and of himself to boot? For that I find him oftentimes servant and drudge: as 'tis seen in the true hermeneutic of art, whereof all excellence upspringeth of itself, like a rare fruit upon some gifted stock, ripening on its arch-personality of inborn faculty, without which gift creativ Reason is barren; altho' it will collaborate activly and eagerly with various governance, which appeareth in some as happy selection and delighted approval of spiritual nativities, that teem i' the mind, surging to escape, like to wild bubbles in a pot when the red fire beneath bristleth, and tortureth the water to airy ebullience;—or in another as toilsom evolution of larval germs, which yet transform while confidently it laböreth thereat slowly as a modeller in clay. How in its naked self Reason wer powerless showeth when philosophers wil treat of Art, the which they are full ready to do, having good intuition that their master-key may lie therein: but since they must lack vision of Art (for elsewise they had been artists, not philosophers) they miss the way; and ev'n the Greeks themselves, supreme in making as in thinking, never of their own art found the true hermeneutic; and the first insight of the twin-gifted Plato was to Aristotle a crude offence; for Plato said that earthly things, whether material objects or abstract notions, wer shadows of Ideas laid up in God's house, —a dainty dish for the sophistic banqueters. And yet this delicat doctrin, that held no shield to Zeno's lancing logic, took not hurt at heart from any mortal assault, but liveth in the schools with flourish'd head serene, high and invulnerable;— because the absurdity of indefinable forms is less than the denial of existence to thought: and truly if all existence is expression of Mind. ideas must themselves be truer existences than whatever else, and in such thought their nearest name. Powers unseen and unknown are the fountains of life: no animal but kenneth that sunlight is warm; no dog but shifteth posture with the shifting shade reasonably as we: but man maketh a dial for it to measur his day, and by his abstract intellect hath taken it for the source and very cause of life; then by science unraveling its physical rays he hath separated some, and found some properties; but of the whole he knoweth that his analysis hath not approach'd the secret of their living power. Nor hath man ever a doubt that mere objects of sense affect his mental states, nor that the mind in turn promoteth the action and function of his animal life in its organs and bones. The Greek astronomer, gazing with naked eye into the starry night, forgat his science and, in transport of spirit, his mortal lot. Then seem'd it to him as if his feet touch'd earth no longer: ???? ???? ???? ????, said he, in the treasur'd words that keep his joy from death, ?????????? ????????? ?????????. Now this imagination of awe and ecstasy, being proper and common in Man, and where lacking or dull so ready to suggestion, it seemeth as tho' the eye had some spiritual vision—as if the idea of Space and also of God existed in the midnight skies; and thus men came to think that their corporeal sense encounter'd reality in the appearance of things; and, stirr'd by influences that outreaching Reason kindled unknown desires, their awed souls fell to prayer that the great Maker of All would reveal his Being. If so be then that Reason, our teacher in all the schools, owneth to existences beyond its grasp, whereon its richer faculties depend, and that those powers are ever present influencing the unconscious mind in its native function to inspire the Will, 'twould seem that as the waken'd mind fashion'd to'ard intellect so the dark workings of his animal instincts faced in a new perspectiv to'ard spiritual sight; and thus man's trouble came of their divergency. For spiritual perception vague and uncontroll'd, being independent of the abstract intelligence, he is disconcerted twixt their rival promises, and doubtful of his road he wavereth following now one now the other: and thus I stand where I conclude that man's true wisdom were a reason'd harmony and correlation of these divergent faculties: this wer the bridge which all men who can see the abyss hav reasonably and instinctivly desired to build; and all their sacraments and mysteries whatsoe'er attempt to build it; from devout Pythagoras to th'last psychologist of Nancy or of Vienna. And between spiritual emotion and sensuous form the same living compact maketh our Art, wherein material appearances engage the soul's depth; and if in men untrain'd without habit of thought the ear is more æsthetic than the eye is, this cometh from thatt sense being the earlier endow'd in animals who, tho' they be all vacant in a picture-gallery nor see themselves in a mirror, attend to music and yield to fascination or vague wonder thereat. So if we, changing Plato's old difficult term, should rename his Ideas Influences, ther is none would miss his meaning nor, by nebulous logic, wish to refute his doctrin that indeed ther are eternal Essences that exist in themselves, supreme efficient causes of the thoughts of men. What is Beauty? saith my sufferings then.—I answer the lover and poet in my loose alexandrines: Beauty is the highest of all these occult influences, the quality of appearances that thru' the sense wakeneth spiritual emotion in the mind of man: And Art, as it createth new forms of beauty, awakeneth new ideas that advance the spirit in the life of Reason to the wisdom of God. But highest Art must be rare as nativ faculty is, and her surprise of magic winneth favor of men more than her inspiration: most are led away by fairseeming pretences, which being wrought for gain pursue the ephemeral fashion that assureth it; and their thin influences are of the same low grade as the unaccomplish'd forms; their poverty is exposed when they would stake their charm on ethic excellence; for then weak simulations of virtues appear, such as convention approveth, but not Virtue itself, tho' not void of all good: and (as I read) 'twas this that Benvenuto intended, saying that not only Virtue was memorable but things so truly done that they wer like to Virtue; and thus prefaced his book, thinking to justify both himself and his works. The authority of Reason therefor relieth at last hereon—that her discernment of spiritual things, the ideas of Beauty, is her conscience of instinct upgrown in her (as she unto conscience of all upgrew from lower to higher) to conscience of Beauty judging itself by its own beauteous judgment. And of War she would say: it ranketh with those things that are like unto virtue, but not virtue itself: rather, in the conscience of spiritual beauty, a vice that needeth expert horsemanship to curb, yet being nativ in the sinew of selfhood, the life of things, the pride of animals, and virtue of savagery, so long as men be savage such it remaineth; and mid the smoke and gas of its new armoury still, with its tatter'd colours and gilt swords of state, retaineth its old glory untarnish'd—heroism, self-sacrifice, disciplin, and those hardy virtues of courage honour'd in Brasidas, without which man's personality were meaner than the brutes. Who hath not known this pictur?—on a hot afternoon of our high summer in August at the country-seat of some vext politician, if in their flashing cars the county-folk gather to his holiday garden, where for their entertainment he hath outspredd the lawns with tents and furnish'd tables, flags and tennis-nets,— if haply he hav set up to dignify his grounds a classic statue of marble, fetch'd by ship from Greece, that standeth there in true ideal nakedness mid parasols and silks, how with blank shadow'd eyes it looketh off from all those aimless idlers there that flaunt around, now and again blurting perchance a shamefast shallow tribute to its beauteous presence! —'tis very like among common concourse of men, who twixt care of comfort and zeal in worldly affairs hav proved serving two masters the vanity of both, when a true soldier appeareth, one compact at heart of sterner virtues and modesty of maintenance, mute witness and martyr of spiritual faith, a man ready at call to render his life to keep his soul. All virtue is in her shape so lovely, that at sight her lover is enamour'd even of her nativ face. And here I part from Aristotle, agreeing else that a good disposition is Goddes happiest gift, without which, as he addeth, Virtue is unteachable, but in minds well-disposed may be by Reason upbuilt: “no man cometh (said she) unto wisdom but by me”; But when he would exalt this guiding principle to be thatt part whereby we are in likeness with God, whose Being (saith he) lieth in the unbroken exercise of absolute intellect—which for their happiness mankind should strive to attain—I halt thereat: and this marreth my full accord where, in a famous text he hath made Desire to be the Prime Mover of all: because the arch-thinker's heav'n cannot move my desire, nor doth his pensiv Deity make call on my love. I see the emotion of saints, lovers and poets all to be the kindling of some Personality by an eternizing passion; and that God's worshipper looking on any beauty falleth straightway in love; and thatt love is a fire in whose devouring flames all earthly ills are consumed, and at least flash of it, be it only a faint radiancy, the freed soul glimpseth, nay ev'n may think to hav felt, some initiat foretaste of that mystic rapture, the consummation of which is the absorption of Selfhood in the Being of God. Ideas and influences spiritually discern'd are of their essence pure: but in the lot of man nothing is wholly pure; yet all hindrance to good —be good and evil two in love or one in strife— maketh occasion for it, by contrast heightening, by challenge and revelly arousing Virtue to act. Hence 'twill not be with men only of contention and hate, nor only with the ambitious and disorderly that combat findeth favor; honest men good and true who seek peace and ensue it, seeing war as the field for exercise of spirit that else might fust unused, embrace the good, and cavil not the inherent terms, rather welcoming hardship; which by affraying cowards purgeth heroic ranks: and battle rallieth all keen-hearted sportsmen and the brave gamesters of life, adventurers whose joy danceth on peril's edge, for whom life hath no relish save in danger of death; who love sport for its hazard, and of all their sports where hazard is at highest look to find the best there on the field where hourly they may stake their all. And 'tis because they feel their spirit's ecstasy is owing in nought to Reason, but exultantly blendeth with the old Selfhood wherefrom it sprang—'tis thus they can be friendly at heart with nature's heartlessness, nor heed the wrongs and cruelties that come and pass, overlook'd as by men who hav suffer'd not nor seen. But we who hav seen, condemn'd in savage self-defence to train our peaceful folk in the instruments of death, and of massacre and mourning hav suffer'd four years— we hav no need to recount in vindication of peace, sorrows which no glory of heroism can atone, horrors which to forget wer cowardice and wrong, dishonesty of heart and repudiation of soul,— yet gladly might forget in the passing of pain; and memory is so complacent that we well may fear lest our children forget;—and see Nature already, regardless how her fractious babe had scratch'd her cheek, hath with her showy Invincibles retaken amain the trenches, and reclothed the devastated lands. See with how placid mien Athena unhelmeted rëentering hath possess'd her desolated halls; how her musical temples and grave schools are throng'd with fresh youth eager as ever with the old books and games, their live abounding mirth rëechoing from the walls, where among antique monuments their brothers' names in long death-roll await the mellowing touch of time. And why not we forget? How is't that we dare not wish to forget and cut this canker of memory from us, as men diseased in one part of their flesh find health in mutilation: as if our agony wer a boon to keep, when in its own happy riddance 'twould die off in the natural oblivion of things, and with our follies fade: so, each one for himself disbanding his self-share, Reason would dissipate its own delusion, and lay that spectre of our dismay, the accumulation of griefs; to which War hath no right prior or prerogative: miseries lay as thick and horrors worse when Plague invaded the cities, Athens or London, raging with polluted flood in every house, and with revolting torture rack'd the folk to loathsom deaths; nor men kenn'd as they fell, desperatly unrepentant to the “scourge of God”, how 'twas the crowded foulness of their own bodies punish'd them so:—alas then in what plight are we, knowing 'twas mankind's crowded uncleanness of soul that brought our plague! which yet we coud not cure nor stay; for Reason had lost control of his hot-temper'd steed and taken himself infection of the wild brute's madness; so when its fire slacken'd and the fierce fight wore out, our fever'd pulse show'd no sober return of health. Amid the flimsy joy of the uproarious city my spirit on those first jubilant days of armistice was heavier within me, and felt a profounder fear than ever it knew in all the War's darkest dismay. BOOK III BREED Having told of selfhood, ere now I tell of breed the younger of the two Arch-Instincts of man's nature, 'twer well here to remember how these pictured steeds are Ideas construed by the abstract Intellect. Whatever abode Philosophy thinketh to build, to erect a lofty temple that may shrine her faith, crowning the unvisited holiness of the hills, or thrust her fair facade amid the noisy dens of swarming Industry, to invite the sons of toil, all altitude expanse or grandeur of building subsisteth on foundations buried out of sight, which yet the good architect carrieth ever in mind, and keepeth the draft by him stored in his folios. So herein 'twas laid down what footing Reason plann'd;— divining Purpose in Natur, it abstracted first her main intentions, and subsumeth under each the old animal passions ancillary thereto, tho' in Nature's economy the same impulse may work to divers ends, as demonstrably is seen in the appetite of hunger, which prime in selfhood promoteth no less all living activities, so universal that some thinkers would make it a corner-stone, and mixing other like fabric build thereon confidently, albeit for such deep trust unfit, being in itself a thing of no substance. And truly pleasur in food, common to all animals that can feel pleasure, comforting the incessant toil of sustenance to enable their blind energies, when once it findeth conscience in the Reason of man is posited by folly as an end-in-itself; till by sensuous refinement it usurpeth rank beside his intellectual and spiritual joys,— a road whereon the brutes already had broken ground (trespassing somewhat haply on nature's allotments), for a Tyger, when once he hath tasted human flesh, in pursuit of his prey is more dangerous to men and chooseth daintily among them; like those cannibals who yet, for all their courtesy (so travellers tell) and Spartan stoicism, gaily devour their kind. From the terrifying jungle of his haunted childhood where prehistoric horror still lurketh untamed, man by slow steps withdrew, and from supply of need fell to pursuit of pleasur, untill his luxury supplanting brutality invented a new shame; for with civilization a caste of cooks was bred, not specialized in structure—as with bees or ants— but serviceable of either sex and disciplin'd in such cultured tradition that the grammar of it would stock a library; nor are their banquets spredd to please the palate only; the eye is invited by dainty disguises and the nostril with scents, nay even the ear is fed, and on the gather'd guests a trifling music playeth, dispelling all thought, that while they fill the belly, the empty mind may float lightly in the full moonshine of o'erblown affluence. Thus, when in London city a Guild of merchants dine, one dinner's cost would ease a whole bye-street of want, its broken meats outface Christ's thrifty miracle. But tho' of its mere sensual smirch the scene be cleansed at fashionable tables, where delicat guests sit and play with their food inattentively, as 'twer in their relaxation an accidental relish to the intellectual banter and familiar discourse of social entertainment—a thing overlook'd among the agreeable superfluities of life, trifles good in themselves, and no more censurable than the fine linen of Ulysses and the brooch that Penelope gave him, nor the rangled shroud that she wove for his sire, nor any work of price that humbly doeth honor unto any temple of God— yet this amenity of Mammon is to the epicure mere disgust, a farrago of incongruous kickshaws, a hazardous pampering, as barbarously remote from pleasure's goal as pothouse cheese and ale. For Reason once engaged on the æsthetic of food refineth every means, as those painters in oil who all their sunless days sat labouring to attain a chiaroscuro of full colour—so the epicure; nor planneth he his creation with a less regard to grandiose composition, in a scheme of morsels gradated to provoke and stimulate alike digestion and appetite; and each viand married with a congenial wine, and each wine in itself a sublimation of fancy, a radiant riotous juice, and of such priceless rarity as no man can come but by luck and genius to possess such bottles. And here the Voluptuary may think his anchor hath bitten on truth; for surely nothing in nature fulfilleth more various expectancies of sense than his wine doth; to the eye luminous as rich gems engendering thru' long æons in the bowels of earth; to the nostrils reminiscent as subtle odours of timorous wind-wavering flowers; to the taste beyond all savours ravishing, insatiable, yet wholesome as is the incense of forested pines, when neath their scorching screens they fume the slumberous air; and to the mind exhilarating, expelling care, even as those well-toned viols, matured by time, which once, when the Muse visited Italy to prepare a voice of beauty for the joy of her children, wer fashion'd by Amati and Stradivari and still, treasured in their mellow shapelinesses, fulfil the genius of her omnipotent destiny,— speaking with incantation of strange magic to charm the dreams that yet undreamt lurk in the unfathom'd deep of mind, unfeatured hopes and loves and dim desires, uttermost forms of all things that shall be. 'Tis thus by the live firework of his wine allured that the epicure thinketh he hath wherewithal to pave thru' palate and gullet a right path for his soul, each feast as a symphonic poem, preluding to melodious Andante Scherzo and final Fugue,— a microcosm, as those musical pæans are that perish not in the using, but persist strengthening their immortality while millions feed on their unquenchable loveliness evermore. In such fine artistry of his putrefying pleasures he indulgeth richly his time untill the sad day come when he retireth with stomach Emeritus to ruminate the best devour'd moments of life; like any old fox-hunter his good days with the hounds, any angler or cricketer, for he too hath follow'd his sport to himself, and each good day of sport (and thatt the dog knoweth and enjoyeth with his Master as well) is a thing in itself, whole even as life is one. This is the supreme ecstasy of the mountaineer, to whom the morn is bright, when with his goal in sight, some icepeak high i' the heav'ns, he is soul-bounden for it, prospecting the uncertain clue of his perilous step to scale precipices where no foot clomb afore, for good or ill success to his last limit of strength; his joy in the doing and his life in his hand he glorieth in the fortunes of his venturous day; 'mid the high mountain silences, where Poesy lieth in dream and with the secret strength of things that governs thought inhabiteth, where man wandereth into God's presence:—But what heav'nly or earthly Muse attendeth the epicure? Nay, what man deigneth ear to his grovelling tale? His gluttony rotteth and stinketh in the dust-bin of Ethic.—Howso that may be, the thing cometh of Self, as War doth; and hereby 'twer well to note how some would derive War from Breed, tho' sex is but the occasion, when jealousy of love provoketh Selfhood to anger: indeed Herodotus, seeking the root-cause of the implacable enmity 'twixt Hellenes and Asiatics to convey his book, dresseth up a frontispiece of four royal rapes, of Io and Medea, Europa and Helen of Troy, playing no doubt upon the flair of his hearers, who love him still for his good faith in his fables. Yet our distinction is proper and holdeth fast. Now breed is to the race as selfhood to the individual; and these two prime Instincts as they differ in purpose are independent each from other, and separat as are the organic tracts in the animal body whereby they function; and tho' Breed is needful alike to plants as to animals, yet its apparatus is found in animals of a more special kind; and since race-propagation might have been assured without differentiation of sex, we are left to guess nature's intention from its full effects in man: and such matter is the first that will follow hereon. Remembering my dissension from Spinoza here, I think of him, Bruno's pupil, ???????? ??????, in his pride at his bench intently shaping his lenses, and how he in thatt irksome toil to earn his bread, the while he ponder'd his great book, was perfecting the tool that invited science to ever minuter anatomy, untill she took skill to handle invisibles; and lately upon thatt path hath divined, in the observed fertilization of plants, atomic mechanism with unlimited power to vary the offspring in character, by mutual inexhaustible interchange of transmitted genes; a theory on such wide experiment upbuilt that the enrichment of species may be assumed to be the purpose of natur in the segregation of sex. Yet this new knowledge throweth no light on our way to a purposeful and wise selfbreeding of mankind which, coud it be, would then responsibly overrule all indiscriminat mating: tho' from such ordeal our hybrid wisdom well might shrink: rather we see complexity irresoluble in obscurity: So may we still follow our instinctiv preferences unrebuked, and in love of Beauty affirm our faith that our happiest espousals are nature's free gift. And the origin of sex lieth yet in thatt darkness where all origins are—since definition of links within our causal chain advanceth us no way in sensible approachment to the first Cause of all: we are happy in our discoveries as a child thinketh he is nearer to the Pole-star when he is put to bed: yet, tracing backwards in the story of sex, the steps of our carpeted staircase are familiar and strong. First among lowest types of life we think to find no separation of sex: plants in the next degree show differentiation at puberty with some signs of mutual approachment: next in higher animals an early differentiation, and at puberty periodic appetite with mutual attraction sometimes engaging Beauty: then at last in man all these same characters promoted and strengthen'd to a constant conscient passion, by Reason transform'd to an altruistic emotion and spiritual love. Breed then together with Selfhood steppeth in pair, for as Self grew thru' Reason from animal rage to vice of war and gluttony, but meanwhile uprose thru' motherly yearning to a profounder affection, so Breed, from like degrading brutality at heart, distilleth in the altruism of spiritual love to be the sublimest passion of humanity, with parallel corruption; in its supremacy confess'd of all, since all in their degree hav felt its divine exaltation and bestial abasement. It hath sanctified fools and degraded heroes; and tho' the warrior wil lightly leave his lady to join in battle (so the weight of the elder horse side-wrencheth at the yoke), he wil return to her more gladly, and often rue his infidelity. In higher natures, poetic or mystical, sense is transfigur'd quite; as once with Dante it was who saw the grace of a fair Florentine damsel as wisdom uncreate: for it happen'd to him in thatt awakening miracle of Love at first sight, which is to many a man his only miracle, his one divine Vision, his one remember'd dream— it happ'd to Dante, I say, as with no other man in the height of his vision and for his faith therein: the starry plenitude of his radiant soul, searching for tenement in the bounties of life, encounter'd an aspect of spiritual beauty at the still hour of dawn which is holier than day: as when a rose-bud first untrammeleth the shells of her swathing petals and looseneth their embrace, so the sunlight may enter to flush the casket of her virgin promise, fairer than her full bloom shall ever be, ere its glories lie squander'd in death:— 'Twas of thatt silent meeting his high vision came rapturous as any vision ever to poet given; since in thatt Sacrament he rebaptized his soul and lived thereafter in Love, by the merit of Faith toiling to endow the world: and on those feather'd wings his mighty poem mounted panting, and lieth now with all its earthly tangle by the throne of God. So to Lucretius also seeking Order in Chance some frenzy of Beauty came, neath which constraint he left his atoms in the lurch and fell to worshipping Aphroditè, the naked Goddess of man's breed; and waving the oriflamme of her divinity above the march of his slow-trooping argument, he attributeth to her the creation and being of all Beauty soe'er: nec sine te quicquam dias in luminis oras exoritur, neque fit laetum neque: amabile quicquam. So well did he in his rapture: such is Beauty's power physical or spiritual; and if it be the cause of spiritual emotion (as hath been said), 'tis plain that Beauty wil be engaged in man's love, in so far as 'tis a proper and actual attribute of man: first, as in animals, of his physical form, to which, when beauty of soul is added, the addition but marketh more specially its human character. Thus Shakespeare, in the sessions of sweet silent thought gathering from memory the idealization of love, when he launch'd from their dream-sheds those golden sonnets that swim like gondolas i' the wake of his drama, fashion'd for their ensignry a pregnant axiom, and wrote: From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby Beauty's Rose might never die; wherein he asserteth beauty to be of love the one motiv, and thatt in double meaning of object and cause. And tho' blind instinct wer full puissant of itself for propagation of man, yet the attraction of beauty bettereth the species, nor without it could ther hav been effect in spirit; and that the poet guarded this showeth in his lyric, where of Sylvia 'tis enquired why all the swains commend her, and he replyeth thereto Holy fair and wise is she, thus giving to Soul first place, thereafter to Body and last of the trine Intelligence; and thatt is their right order in Love. And this high beauty of spirit—in the conscience of it, in the love of it, and the appearances of it— tho' it hav no quarrel with thatt physical beauty whereof 'twas born, when once 'tis waken'd in the mind needeth no more support of the old animal lure, but absolute in its transmitted power and grace maketh a new beauty of its own appearances. Thus oft the full majesty and happiness of love is found in lovers whose corporeal presences would seem disloyalty to the gay worshippers of the goddess of grace, nor fit to approach her shrine: yet lightly wil Love rate the ridicule of them whose passion, subsisting in the flourish of flesh, outlasteth not its brief prime, but must fade and fade as thatt fadeth, and when it perisheth perish; and who themselves—save in the rout of their revel they hav perish'd immature—provide tales of despair, disease and madness; melancholy tragedies of ignobility unredeem'd, to scare mankind. But love's true passion is of immortal happiness, whereof the Greeks, maybe,—whose later poets told of a heav'nly Aphroditè—had some dim prescience before man ever arrived at thatt wisdom thru' Christ, and now teacheth to his children as their birthright,—a gift whose wealth is amplified by spending, and its charm rejuvenated by habit, that dulleth all else: nor needeth it for joy to look off from this earth and beyond, nor to sit on the schoolbench with them who dispute in argument the existence of God; being of eternity it overcometh evil as any nativ disposition is apt to do, but more surely and with its virtue more self-secure than the merry or sad heart is, that in laughter or tears wil keep unchanged its temper, whatsoe'er befall; so priketh hem Nature in hir corages. But think not Aphroditè therefor disesteem'd for rout of her worshippers, nor sensuous Beauty torn from her royal throne, who is herself mother of heavenly Love (so far as in human aspect eternal essence can hav mortal parentage), our true compass in art as our comfort in faith, our daily bread of pleasur;—enough that thus I deem of Beauty among Goddes best gifts, and even above the pleasur of Virtue accord it honour of men. The allure of bodily beauty is mutual in mankind as is the instinct of breed, which tho' it seem i' the male more activ, is i' the female more predominant, more deeply engaging life, grave and responsible. Thus while in either sex celibat lives are led without impoverishment of intellect or will, this thing is rare in women, whereas in the man virginity may seem a virile energy in its angelic liberty, prerequisit to the perfection of some high personality. And here we are driv'n to enquire of Reason how it came that bodily beauty is deem'd a feminin attribute, since not by science nor æsthetick coud we arrive at such a judgment. But not triflingly to trench on prehistoric problems, 'twil be enough to say that from the first it may not always hav been so, and primacy of beauty may hav once lain with the male, in days of pagan savagery, afore men left their hunting and took tillage of the fields in hand, superseding the women and all their moon-magic, to invent a reason'd labor of intensiv culture, as now 'tis seen;—whether in remotest orient lands whose cockcrow is our curfew, where Chineses swarm teasing their narrow plots with hand and hoe, carrying their own dung on their heads obsequiously as ants; or on our western farms where now machines usurp such manual labor, and hav with their strange forms dethroned the heraldry of the seasons, fair emblems of eld that seem'd the inalienable imagery of mankinde. How was November's melancholy endear'd to me in the effigy of plowteams following and recrossing patiently the desolat landscape from dawn to dusk, as the slow-creeping ripple of their single furrow submerged the sodden litter of summer's festival! They are fled, those gracious teams; high on the headland now squatted, a roaring engin toweth to itself a beam of bolted shares, that glideth to and fro combing the stubbled glebe: and agriculture here, blotting out with such daub so rich a pictur of grace, hath lost as much of beauty as it hath saved in toil. Again where reapers, bending to the ripen'd corn, were wont to scythe in rank and step with measured stroke, a shark-tooth'd chariot rampeth biting a broad way, and jerking its high swindging arms around in the air, swoopeth the swath. Yet this queer Pterodactyl is well, that in the sinister torpor of the blazing day clicketeth in heartless mockery of swoon and sweat, as 'twer the salamandrine voice of all parch'd things: and the dry grasshopper wondering knoweth his God. Or what man feeleth not a new poetry of toil, whenas on frosty evenings neath its clouding smoke the engin hath huddled up its clumsy threshing-coach against the ricks, wherefrom laborers standing aloft toss the sheaves on its tongue; while the grain runneth out, and in the whirr of its multitudinous hurry it hummeth like the bee, a warm industrious boom that comforteth the farm, and spreadeth far afield with throbbing power; as when in a cathedral awhile the great diapason speaketh, and the painted saints feel their glass canopies flutter in the heav'nward prayer. Thus hath man's Reason dealt since he took spade in hand, either by wit of the insect or of the engineer: and they who hav come to think that in remotest times Eve delved and Adam span, can show matriarchy of sorts had precedent in natur, ostensibly among birds, whose males more gaudily feather'd wil disport their charms and dance in coquetry to win the admiring hens: Verily it well may be that sense of beauty came to those primitiv bipeds earlier than to man. But howso in patriarchal times our code upgrew, it hath decretals honour'd in the courts of Love: 'tis the faith of all poets from the Troubadours to Shelley's broken amours, and that the fair Muses should hav masculin wooers was Apollo's will who favour'd his own sex. But had the god inspired poetesses many as poets—coud thatt hav been— follies had cancel'd out truly in the equation of love, and steadier fire of passion would hav warm'd the world. Today if any lady in her boudoir rhymeth, she is drown'd in man's tradition and disguiseth her tone, transposing her high music to the lower clef; or deemeth thatt the orthodoxy of the sapphic mode, because of the two love songs which pedantry hath saved of Sappho's complisht artistry, one by mischance, in thatt muliebrous dump which gave Catullus pause, hath this falsification of her true soprano. But 'twas the deeper voice that robed passion in song, with the masculin emotion that glorify'd it: and man, finding elation in physical beauty and in the passion of sex his chief transport of soul, ascribed supremacy of beauty to woman's grace, and she to'ardly accepted his idolatry. Yet if the passion had been identic in the twain, the woman surely had found her like ideal in man; but the motivs of Nature that determin life are hidden, and with the sexes they are unlike in love. For tho' true loves are mutual and of equal strength and their bodily communion is a sacrament— like those irrevocable initiations of yore whose occult ritual it was profane to disclose— and in its uttermost surrender of secrecies hallowing brute instinct, symbolizeth approach to satisfaction of unattainable desire; yet in fullest devotion and frankest abandon of eager and mutual mating, whether or no she ken, the woman's choice hath been by a deeper purpose led, whereof the mastering revelation awaiteth her in the reality of her Motherhood; wherefor, that her son may be noble, she will seek his sire where her ideal, howe'er vaguely imagin'd, lieth outside her sphere, beyond her—and so thinketh she less of thatt for which her mate praiseth and seeketh her, and longing evermore for what she most lacketh, in her thought of wisdom looketh for higher things, and for immortal Roses desireth increase. How Natur (as Plato saith) teacheth man by beauty, and by the lure of sense leadeth him ever upward to heav'nly things, and how the mere sensible forms which first arrest him take on ever more and more spiritual aspect,—yet discard not nor disown their sensuous beauty, since thatt is eternal and sure, the essence thereof being the reverent joy of life— this everywhere is seen and most overtly in Breed (too many in truth ther be who find it never elsewhere); yet man is slow to see that love's call to woman is graver and more solemn than it can be to him, by reason of her higher function and duty therein, and that all past attainment which his spirit hath won came to him thru' motherhood of the nursling boy;— yea, ev'n the dignity of his masculin intellect, that outreacheth her range, was first of her making and never coud hav fruited but for the devout fostering environment of her lovingkindness: nor can man's futur attainment forgo thatt shelter, wherewith her precocious girlhood accompanieth the evergrowing incumbency of his pupillage, as it grew in the brutes: . . . and here 'tis seen again how 'tis a backsliding and treason against nature when women wil unsex their own ideal of Love, and ignorantly aiming to be in all things as men, would make love as men make it—tho' Sappho did thatt, who rare among women for manly mastery of art, a Nonsuch of her kind, exceeded by default, nondescript, and for lack of the true feminin borrow'd effeminacy of men, the incontinents, who, ranking with gluttons in Aristotle's book, made a lascivious pleasure of their Lesbian loves; till in the event the euphony of her isle's fair name whisper'd an unspoken and else unspeakable shame. Nor can the ethic that here intrudeth be deny'd, since if man speak of morals 'tis of sex they think; forwhy the passion of it both transporteth their souls and troubleth daily life with problems of conduct. Now to the most who are like to read my English poem christian marriage wil seem a stablish'd ordinance, as universal, wholesome and needful to man as wheat is, which, ubiquitous, and sib to a weed that yet wil hamper its cultur, overruleth all else, weigheth our gold by single grains, and harvested measureth in sacks the peace and welfare of the world, our bread of life, and symbol of the food of the soul. But tho' monogamy had been by wise lawgivers coded with rights and duties and property, and thus by Jewish use or Roman held place in the Church, the instinct of sex was ever anathema to the Essenes whose thought handsel'd the faith; 'twas to thatt sect the accurst contamination of all spiritual purity: and only after tough battle against two mighty outbursts of Pagan Poetry coud marriage come in the end to its own, from being a tolerated discordancy to be an accepted harmony, and hallow'd as such within the Church, a sacrament. Of those two wars the story is long, and now 'tis here briefly to tell. The first War of the Essenes was with the poetry of selfhood, those sagas and epic rhapsodies which had burst forth to flood all Europe in the time of the northern invasions, when the hideous Huns, extending the right wing of their havoc, swept down on the old land of the Goths. Soon as their arrows prick'd our Teuton forefathers, a clash of arms and yell of battle arose, that in the unsearchable storage of earth's high firmament vibrateth to this day. The warriors, who in vain defence of home escaped the first mauling and massacre, wer driven forth and, pressing Westward desperatly, became in turn themselves ruthless invaders, live firebrands that spredd the blast of their contagion to Allemand and Frank, Burgundian, Vandal and Lombard, from Angle and Dane to furthest Kelt; and with the sword follow'd the song, an inextinguishable pæan of battle and blood. A sudden eruption of nature, as when earth quaketh and faltering along the edges of its wrinkling shell the mountains roar and crack, and vent their ruddy bowels in spume of molten lava; as oft hath been where now some gracious valley embosom'd in soft azurous hills smileth, an Eden as fair as Goddes love was feign'd to have planted for man's use—thatt lost garden regain'd, lost once thru' pride and now by long stooping regain'd,— a pictur and outward symbol of the comfort of them whose spirits dwell in the Eden that the Muse hath made, her garden of soul in the golden lapses of Time; and if, tracing to its source some Heliconian rill, its mossgrown cave is found in the black splinter'd rock, where thatt once cool'd and stay'd, a volcanic moraine to bank his blossom'd Paradise and feed his vines, ther-after to the poet all his joy will seem a strange mysterious dream, a thread of beauty eterne enwoven in mortal change, and he himself a flower fertilized awhile on the quench'd torrent of Hell. Now when Rome's mitred prelates ambled o'er the Alps to hold the Gallic provinces, whose overlords their missioners had won to the confession of Christ, the pagan folk submissiv to constraint wer driv'n in flocks to th'font, but got little washing therein. Whatever of kindliness Tacitus once had found sequester'd in the rude homesteads of Germany was burnt up in thatt fiery ordeal, which taught them the joy of frenzy and prowess, and the songs whereby they glorify'd the memory of successful lust, and stirr'd anew the fierce delight of battle and blood. A wilder strain maybe than the lost Bedouin songs, that seal'd the weird which the Angel in Araby foretold to the outcast bondwoman in the famishing desert, and she to her son,—that his horoscope was to range like the wild ass untameable, and his hand should be 'gainst ev'ry man, and ev'ry man's hand against him. Wherefor hitting for remedy on Plato's old plan, when he proscribed Homer from his Utopian schools— saying that morals wer unteachable to men who imputed mortal passions to the immortal gods—, the priests denounced the bards, and would hav stopp'd their mouths; but finding that forbiddance met with no regard they turn'd to assure their flock by amity, and to comb the fleece they might not shear: upon which way they wrought some mitigation, and growing reconciled to the art, and grudging to the heathen what might serve the Church, they took thought to divert it, and engaged the bards to make like stirring balladry of the Bible tales: wherein, joining themselves with good heart to the work, their first grains of allowance multiply'd to pounds; while with their clerkly skill they sat fast to transcribe the old pagan tales, redacted to the amended form in which we know them, with what other numberless wonder-lives of the Saints they wrote, symbolic masques of Christian orthodoxy, and later mystery-plays. So all these diverse stuffs thru' the dark centuries lay quietly a-soak together in the dye-vats, wherein our British Arthur was clandestinely christen'd and crown'd, and all his knights cleansed and respirited, reclothed as might be: for the dispossess'd devils had kindly accepted their rebate, content to find their old home swept and garnish'd; and tho' verily in their domestication, as 'tis with brutes, they had lost keenness of sense and true compact of character, they flourish to this day the darlings of our poets, who drape their model Arthur to their taste, whereas time was when good St. Andrew strode forth in plate-mail. While thus the Catechists made compromising peace with the poetry of selfhood, ere the fight was won in rescue of womanhood from the ravish of war, a new era had dawn'd and a new strain of song, the young poetry of breed; and the conflict therewith is in my story styled the second Essene War. 'Twas no Huns now that stirr'd the Frankish heart to sing, nay rather Athena's call, and the gracious emblems of Hellenic humanity, that long had drown'd where they had sunk o'erwhelm'd in the wreckage of Rome, undersuck'd in the wallow, when Cæsar's great ship founder'd with all its toys decadent in the deep, now again of their buoyancy up-struggling here and there to ride in sparkling dance on the desolate sea: Or what grave lore had refuged with the Ishmaelite was stealing back from exile to its western home, its mansion of birthright, and had now already inspired passionat Abelard, who with his ethnic books was heralding in Paris that full Renaissance which should illumin Europe, and plant her cities with Universities of learning, sanctuaries of spirit, our schools of thought and science to this day. Full Springtime was not yet surely, nor soon to be: 'twas as mayhap à ce jour de Saint Valentin que chacun doit choisir son per, or a later day of February, when in the shelter'd woodland the Sun with broadening smile thinketh to intercalate a glad red-letter'd feast in Winter's almanac, which the thrush boldly announceth—tho' the migrant birds hav yet made no return upon the balmy sprays, but the small homekeepers muster what choir they can: Not elsewise was thatt first impetuous raid that storm'd the rear of the dark ages prematurely; and yet the singers wer so many that man marveleth still whence they came, or by what spontaneous impulse sang. As well might be with one who wendeth lone his way beside the watchful dykes of the flat Frisian shore, what hour the wading tribes, that make their home and breed numberless on the marshy polders, creep unseen widely dispersed at feed, and silent neath the sun the low unfeatured landscape seemeth void of life— when without warning suddenly all the legion'd fowl rise from their beauties' ambush in the reedy beds, and on spredd wings with clamorous ecstasy carillioning in the air manœuvre, and where they wheel transport the broken sunlight, shoaling in the sky— with like sudden animation the fair fields of France gave birth to myriad poets and singers unknown, who in a main flight gathering their playful flock settled in Languedoc, on either side the Rhone within the court and county of Raymond of Toulouse. Nor wer these Troubadours hucksters of song who tuned their pipes for fee: some far glimpse of the heav'nly Muse had reach'd and drawn the soul by the irresistible magnet of love: as when in the blockish marble the sculptor's thought of beauty loometh into shape neath his rude hammerstrokes, ere the true form is seen; so had the monks' rough-hewing of the old pagan tales discover'd virtue:—an Ideal of womanhood had striven into outline; which, tho' passion heeded not yet art had grasp'd, divining fresh motiv for skill, whereby knights, churchmen, monks, courtiers and scholars all childishly wer enthrall'd: ev'n kings found honor in rhyme whose royalty is today its only honor, and to us would seem frivolity, knew we not that we watch beside the rocking-cradle of babes, whose prattling tongues should oust monarchic Latin from his iron throne— which not the slaughter of this one innocent coud save: Skysoarers should be hatch'd of such young flutterers; for whom two freaks of fortune happily conspired, a fine phantasy of spirit with light fabric of art; so the faint dream of chivalry, as it took-on form, tripp'd delicatly with the delicat music of the tentativ language, whose mincing metres imposed good manners on the articulation of speech. While in such play Count Raymond's folk lived joyfully, Provence seem'd to mankind the one land of delight,— a country where a man might fairly choose to dwell; tho' some would rather praise the green languorous isles, Hawaii or Samoa, and some the bright Azores, Kashmire the garden of Ind, or Syrian Lebanon and flowery Carmel; or wil vaunt the unstoried names of African Nairobi, where by Nyanza's lakes Nile hid his flooding fountain, or in the New World far Pasadena's roseland, whence who saileth home westward wil in his kalendar find a twin day. But I in England starving neath the unbroken glooms of thatt dreariest November which wrapping the sun, damping all life, had robb'd my poem of the rays whose wealth so far had sped it, I long'd but to be i' the sunshine with my history; and the names that held place in my heart and now shall hav place in my line wer Avignon, Belcaire, Montelimar, Narbonne, Béziers, Castelnaudary, Béarn and Carcasonne, and truly I coud hav shared their fancy coud I hav liv'd among those glad Jongleurs, living again for me, and had joy'd with them in thatt liberty and good-will which men call toleration, a thing so stiff to learn that to sceptics 'tis left and cynics. In Provence Jew quarrell'd not with Gentile; ther was peace and love 'twixt Saracen and Christian, Catalan and Frank; and (wonder beyond wonder) here was harbour'd safe, flourishing and multiplying, thatt sect of all sects abominable, persecuted and defamed, who with their Eastern chaffering and insidious talk had ferreted thru' Europe to find peace on earth with Raymond of Toulouse,—those ancient Manichees. Restless and impatient man's mind is ever in quest of some system or mappemond or safeguard of soul, and coming not at Truth—ev'n as a dry-athirst horse that drinketh eagerly of the first gilded puddle,— he espouseth delusion and sweareth fealty thereto: and since common conditions breed common opinion, nations lie fascinated in their swaddling clothes crampt, and atrophied with their infantile suctions. So in the inmost sanctum of the Hindu mind a milch-cow is enshrined: but those dour Manichees wer trifling with no symbols; their wild creed had grown deep-rooted on the prime obsession of savagery, thatt first terrifying nightmare of dawning conscience which, seeing in natur a power maleficent to man, estopp'd his growth in love: for these zealots ascribed this visible world to the work of a devil, from all time Goddes foe and enemy to all good: In hate of which hellpower so worthy of man's defiance they had lost the old fear, and finding internecine war declared twixt flesh and spirit in the authentic script of Paul of Tarsus, him they took for master, and styled themselves Paulicians the depositaries of Christ. Their creed—better than other exonerating God from blame of evil—and their austere asceticism shamed the half-hearted clerics, whose licence in sin confirm'd the uncompromising logic, which inferr'd a visible earthly Church to be Satan's device, the Pope his minister,—him, the third Innocent, who held his wide ambition for the will of God, his fulminating censure for the voice of Christ; and, troubled now that he coud neither cleanse nor cure, persuade not nor command, fell; and betray'd by zeal (as angry Peter once to serve Christ with the sword), preach'd a Crusade within the fold,—thatt bloody wrath label'd in history The Albigensian war, a sinking millstone heavy as ever pontiff tied round the neck of the Church. For the champions of Christ outdid the heathen Huns in cruelty, and in the end was Raymond's county ravaged to ruin and his folk massacred all or burnt alive, man woman and child, and their language wiped out, so that a man today reading Provençal song studieth in a dead tongue. Yet many Troubadours escaping from slaughter fled to the Italian cities where the New Learning gave kind asylum to their secret flame; and ere within the Church's precincts they had raised a song, Chivalry had won acceptance in the ideal of sex and, blending with the worship of the Mother of God, assured the consecration of marriage, still unknown save to the christian folk of Europe whence it sprang. Thus, as it came to pass, the second Essene War brought the New Life in which full soon Dante was born. The motive of Selfhood is common to all Being, the universal Mind informing existence, and had there been no beauty in life nor any joy beyond thatt ground-pleasure, which all creatures may feel in the inconscient functionings of their organisms and satisfaction of instinct—had thatt been, ev'n so nothing had lack'd to inspire the selfassertion of man: But since ther is beauty in nature, mankind's love of life apart from love of beauty is a tale of no count; and tho' he linger'd long in his forest of fear, or e'er his apprehensiv wonder at unknown power threw off the first night-terrors of his infant mind, the vision of beauty awaited him, and step by step led him in joy of spirit to full fruition. Now as with Selfhood so was it again with Breed; for the fashioning of sex was attended thru'out by necessary attractions—as tis seen in plant or animal, and these as they suffice in brutes suffice in man so far as he also is animal; but being specifically endow'd he must in course hav with the growth of reason outgrown the animal wont; and in perfection of kind he surely had lost his lure, had he not learn'd in beauty to transfigure love. Many shy at such doctrin: Science, they will say, knoweth nought of this beauty. But what kenneth she of color or sound? Nothing: tho' science measure true every wave-length of ether or air that reacheth sense, there the hunt checketh, and her keen hounds are at fault; for when the waves hav pass'd the gates of ear and eye all scent is lost: suddenly escaped the visibles are changed to invisible; the fine-measured motions to immeasurable emotion; the cypher'd fractions to a living joy that man feeleth to shrive his soul. How should science find beauty? Leibnitz rightly is held the most irrefutable of all philosophers, because he boldly excised the intrinse knot from the rope and, showing both ends free, proclaim'd no knot had been; imagining two independent worlds that move in pre-establish'd harmony twixt matter and mind; —a pleasant freak of man's godlike intelligence, vex'd by so vain a need; and thinking, with a thought so inconceivable, to save appearances. That ther is beauty in natur and that man loveth it are one thing and the same; neither can be derived apart as cause of the other: and here it is to tell how female beauty came to be the common lure in human marriage.—First in animal mating the physical attractions, as they evolved with sense, took-on beautiful forms, til beauty (as in bird-song) was recognized consciently and exploited by art, and after in man became that ladder of joy whereon slowly climbing at heaven he shall find peace with God, and beauty be wholly spiritualised in him, as in its primal essence it must be conceived. This ken we truly, that as wonder to intellect, so for the soul desire of beauty is mover and spring; whence, in whatever his spirit is most moved, a man wil most be engaged with beauty; and thus in his “first love” physical beauty and spiritual are both present mingled inseparably in his lure: then is he seen in the ecstasy of earthly passion and of heavenly vision to fall to idolatry of some specious appearance as if 'twer very incarnation of his heart's desire, whether eternal and spiritual, as with Dante it was, or mere sensuous perfection, or as most commonly a fusion of both—when if distractedly he hav thought to mate mortally with an eternal essence all the delinquencies of his high passion ensue. Verily if Hope wer not itself a happiness sorrow would far outweigh our mortal joy, but Hope incarnat in the blood kindleth its hue no less with every breath, to flood all the sluices of life long as the heart can beat. And yet in love-mating hope's ideal is so rich and fulfilment so rare, that common minds in trudge with common experience may think to amend their lot by renouncing life-vows, as a vain bondage perversiv of happiness. And coud man separate brutal from spiritual, and in things of the flesh live as animals do stealing their food and seizing the delight of the hour, thatt were reasonable enough and might be wise in man; but such divorcement being in the provision of things shut out, ther is no way left nor choice for him, unless he would make shipwreck, and of mere brutality fall to pieces—ther is no hope for him but to attune nature's diversity to a human harmony, and with faith in his hope and full courage of soul realizing his will at one with all nature, devise a spiritual ethic for conduct in life. Refusal of christian marriage is, as 'twer in art, to impugn the credit of the most beautiful things because ther are so few of them, and hold it folly to aim at excellence where so few can succeed; and where any success pincheth the happiness of the far greater number, who left to themselves might feel fuller content admiring common things or ugly, and be happier in whatever likings they can indulge. Altho' they know it not, this is the humanitarianism of democracy; and since ther is in the mass little good to look for but what instruction, authority and example impose, Ethick and Politick alike hav trouble in store. Now mere impulse of sex,—from animal mating to the vision of Dante—tho' strong in all degrees, is not the bond of marriage. Nay, if breeding ceased,— all motiv to it, liking for it and thought of it,— women and men would mate; and, whatever might lack, married life might be found a more congenial state, and marriage of true minds hav less impediment. Happiness which all seek is not composable of any summation of particular pleasures; the happiness in marriage dependeth for-sure not on the animal functions, but on qualities of spirit and mind that are correlated therewith. So 'twas not of false ethic or weak prudery when thatt old Hebrew poet, in his mighty myth of man's creation, imagin'd Eve's predestiny to be helpmate and comfort to God's perfect man; nor in thatt strange fashioning of her from Adam's rib fudged he his symbol; perfect man being in thatt theft imperfected by loss of an original part now personate in Eve, who should reveal to him what was in first design confused in his nature, and from thatt fleshly cleavage find true tally of flesh. This myth was law to th'Jew, and 'twas men of that ilk (those same Essenes whose creed prevail'd so long), who when Christ's mournful company wer by his death reft of their earthly dreams, took courage, and reset their disillusion'd hope bolder—to look no more for Rome and Cæsar's overthrow, but rather expect Jahveh's wrathful dissolution of all creation; that Christ would rëappear in pitiless Godhead full suddenly and full soon, to judge the world of sin, and with his angels gather up his living elect to his new Jerusalem, those few Saints undefiled, who had wash'd their robes to whiteness in the blood o' the Lamb. Now those stern Puritans who liv'd but in thatt faith, in whom motiv and lure of breed wer wholly extinct, execrating the body as other men flee death, had no fear of contamination or thought of ill in taking women in marriage, each man one to himself, as comrades indispensable, of spiritual aid. Truly myths so ancient and examples of life, fish'd up out of the old jumble-box of history, can find but little credit with this generation who, like to children absorb'd in the scientific toys of their high-kilted gossips, care not to ransack the nursery cupboard for their grand-dam's old playthings; tho' family relics are they, once loved, and may show how that in man's eternal quest of happiness, contempt of fleshly pleasur is as near to his spirit as is the love of it to his animal nature. Vestiges of his stony asceticism imbue all time, thick as the strewage of his flinty tools, disseminate wheresoe'er he hath dwelt; nor need we now, from where they sleep bedded on archæologic shelves, fetch down upon the lecture-table our specimens to teach what manners went to the making of man; having such living witness of harmonized life in the aristocracy of our English motherhood, whence the nobility of our sons came, and therewith precedence of their courtesy title in the world; a tradition of good-faith, humanity and courage, that year by year flowereth on the grafted stock of Saxon temperament; the which slow or dead to beauty, is but a dullard in spiritual sense. And so the character of our common folk, up-built in the commanding presence of this feminin grace, won therefrom (as I hold) its vulgar excellence; for finding their own conduct unconformable to beauty of so high grade, they guarded it apart submissiv in its own status, a kindly thing with nativ honesty and good commonsense convinced; and, easing embarrassment with the humour of life, paid due respect and honour where they felt 'twas due, so they might goodtemper'dly and in laughable wise hobnob with ugliness, and jest at frightfulness, and keep the farce up mirthfully in the face of death. If any see not this fractur in our midst, because the pieces are in place, 'tis pictured for him true in Shakespeare's drama, where ideal women walk in worship, and the baser sort find sympathy, and both are bravely stirr'd together as water and oil. But if 'tis ask'd to name what special function it was that fell sequester'd out of Adam in his lost rib, and which, when launch'd by Reason on his sea of troubles, should be his paregoric and comforting cure,— 'twas no unique, ultimately separable thing, as is a chemic element; far rather our moods, influences and spiritual affections are like those many organic substances which, tho' to sense wholly dissimilar and incomparable in kind, are yet all combinations of the same simples, and even in like proportions differently disposed; so that whether it be starch, oil, sugar, or alcohol 'tis ever our old customers, carbon and hydrogen, pirouetting with oxygen in their morris antics; the chemist booketh all of them as CHO, and his art is as mine, when I but figurate the twin persistent semitones of my Grand Chant. And 'twer but bookish, surely, in the fabric of mind to assume the disposition of vital elements under a few common names, alike in both sexes; 'tis easier thought that ther is no human faculty that hath not been in long elaboration of sex adjusted finely, and often to such richer ends that, tho' by correlation characters of sex, they are not held in subservience to the impulse of Breed,— as some deem, and impute precocious puberty to new-born babes, and all their after trouble in life to shamefast thwarting of inveterat lust. Now Woman took her jointure from the potency of spirit stored in flesh, the which, affined to her sex, became a property of intuition and grew in her, thru' mutual adaptation with the environments that wer its own effects, to a female character in worth alike and weakness distinct from the male: for while man's Reason drew him whither science led to walk with downcast eyes fix'd on the ground, and low incline his ear to catch the sermon-whisper of stones— whence now whole nations, by their treasure-trove enrich'd, crawl greedily on their knees nosing the soil like swine, and any, if they can twist their stiffen'd necks about, see the stars but as stones,—while men thus search'd the earth, stooping to pick up wisdom, women stood erect in honest human posture, from light's fount to drink celestial influences; and this was seen in them that worship'd Christ nor look'd, as then the apostles did, for some earthly prosperity or prospect, nor ask'd what chief seats might be theirs reserved in the Kingdom; his heavenly call drew them, and the Mary who sat at Christ's feet in devotion, heard from him her choice pronounced the one thing needful; and as 'twas for her, so is it nowaday for us to our happiness. For 'tis by such faith only a man can save his soul; since as his unique spirit cometh more and more out of slumber into vision, he loseth heart the more at the inhumanity of nature's omnipotence. Thatt first savage suspicion is now the last despair of earnest thinkers, who for love of truth refuse to blink dishonestly the tribulation of man, but deem it final truth, and see no cure thereof, nor solace save what brave distraction of thought may bring in further keen pursuit of knowledge, on the old path that hath hereby led them where the everlasting worm eateth their hearts . . . and yet man's Reason (as is confess'd) since 'tis of nature's fabric must share in her fault; and man's spiritual sense, which inspireth his grief, is equally of her giving: whence his complaint sheweth the strange perversity of creation's self-reproach; tho' nature the while is by beauty awakening her heavenly response to her heavenliest desire, and in spiritual joy sanctioneth to the full the claim of faith. To such despairers Christ out-spake in his rich poetry 'Tis better with one eye blinded to enter into the life of Goddes Realm than with both eyes to grieve in Hell. Be that not Truth, then there is something found for man better than Truth; which thought were the supreme vanity of vanities, at once a superhuman ambition and a poor pride, truly the last infirmity of his noble mind. From blind animal passion to the vision of Spirit all actual gradations come of natur, and each severally in time and place is answerable in man. As with the embryo which in normal growth passeth thru' evolutionary stages, at each stage consisting with itself agreeably, so Mind may be by observation in young changes waylaid, agreeable all, tho' no more congruous with themselves than what a baby thinketh of its naked feet, when first it is aware of them, is like the thought of piteous sympathy with which when an old man he wil come to regard them. So likewise of breed, youth and age hold their irreconcilable extremes, from him who deemeth sex to be the curse of man to him who findeth in it the only pleasur of life: then the four temperaments of blood possess of kind their different sensibilities, and every bias of education coloureth; while in abstract thought some would submit its energy to rule of state, to ethic duty some, others to personal health, to social propriety or the grace of good manners; climate can subjugate and religion constrain; national taste prescribe practice and fix ideals; yet howso no two men wil be found wholly alike, nor any one man always consonant in himself; the saint wil hav his days of humiliation and trial, the clown his rare moments of revelation and peace, while commonsense wil waver in its faith with fortune. Now as a physical object apparent to sense must in all its perspectivs be studied, tho' none be true wholly in itself, and reality is found by elimination of error, so 'twil be with Love, which, if it had no various aspects of feeling nor delusiv perspectivs to spiritual sight, neither coud it hav any essential property in the Wisdom of God: thus men, who mostly liv in the light of one aspect and convinced thereby, wil deem of love differently, and in as many ways as there be planes of spirit and faculties of mind: and the philosopher expecteth little audience of men school'd to the habit of their own liking, and wer he heaven-inspired he should not therefor look to win the general ear; yet, one proviso allow'd he may command agreement; so (saith he) if ther be any one scheme of Reason in the evolution of Mind preferable and probable—and without so much faith he would sit dumb—then thatt ideal wil be found in few, not in many, but potential in them, and in the best imperfect, a desire of all, an everlasting hope not everlastingly to be rebuff'd and baffled, rather prëordain'd by arch-creative Wisdom, as man groweth to find his Will in Goddes pleasur, his pleasur in Goddes Will; drawn to thatt happiness by the irresistible predominant attraction, which worketh secure in mankind's Love of Beauty and in the Beauty of Truth. Art is the true and happy science of the soul, exploring nature for spiritual influences, as doth physical science for comforting powers, advancing so to a sure knowledge with like progress: but lovers who thereto look for expression of truth hav great need to remember that no plastic Art, tho' it create ideals noble as are the forms that Pheidias wrought, can ever elude or wholly escape its earthly medium; nor in its adumbrations reach thatt detach'd suprasensuous vision, whereto Poetry and Music soar, nor dive down in the mine where cold philosophy diggeth her fiery jewels— or only by rare magic may it sometimes escape. And this was the intuition of our landscape-painters, whose venture seem'd humbled in renouncing the prize of the classic contest, when like truants from school they made off to the fields with their satchels, and came on nature's beauteous by-paths into a purer air: For the Art of painting, by triumph of colouring enticed to Realism, had confounded thereby its own higher intention, and in portrayal of spirit made way for Symbolism which, tho' it stand aloof, is outfaced in the presence of direct feeling: Sithence in presentation of feminin beauty the highest Art lost mastery of its old ideal; as in the great pictur of the two Women at a Well, where Titian's young genius, devising a new thing, employ'd the plastic power to exhibit at once two diverse essences in their value and contrast; for while by the æsthetic idealisation of form his earthly love approacheth to celestial grace, his draped Uranian figure is by symbols veil'd, and in pictorial Beauty suffereth defeat: Yea, despite all her impregnable confidence in the truth of her wisdom, as there she sitteth beside the fountain, dazzlingly apparel'd, enthroned, with thoughtful face impassiv, averting her head as 'twer for fuller attention so to incline an ear to the impartial hearing of the importunat plea of the other, who over-against her on the cornice-plinth posturing her wonted nakedness in sensuous ease, leaneth her body to'ards her, and with imploring grace urgeth the vain deprecation of her mortal prayer. Giorgione, his master, already had gone to death plague-stricken at prime, when Titian painted that picture, donning his rival's mantle, and strode to higher fame— yet not by this canvas; he who had it, hid it; nor won it public favour when it came to light, untill some mystic named it in the Italian tongue L'Amor Sacro e Profano, and so rightly divined; for tho' ther is no record save the work of the brush to tell the intention, yet what the mind wrought is there; and who looketh thereon may see in the two left arms the symbolism apportioning the main design; for while the naked figure with extended arm and outspredd palm vauntingly balanceth aloft a little lamp, whose flame lost in the bright daylight wasteth in the air, thatt other hath the arm bent down and oppositely nerved, and clencheth with gloved hand closely the cover'd vessel of her secret fire. Thus Titian hath pictured the main sense of my text, and this truth: that as Beauty is all with Spirit twined, so all obscenity is akin to the ugliness which Art would outlaw; whence cometh that tinsel honour and mimicry of beauty which is the attire of vice. Allegory is a cloudland inviting fancy to lend significance to chancey shapes; and here I deem not that the child, who playeth between the Loves at Titian's well, was pictured by him with purpose to show the first contact of love with boyhood's mind; and yet never was symbol more deftly devised: Mark how the child looking down on the water see'th only a reflection of the realities—as 'twas with the mortals in Plato's cave—nor more of them than Moses saw of God; he can see but their backs, save for a shifty glimpse of the pleading profil of earthly Love (which also is subtle truth); and most how in his play his plunged hand stirreth to and fro both images together in a confused dazzle of the dancing ripples as he gazeth intent. BOOK IV ETHICK Beauty, the eternal Spouse of the Wisdom of God and Angel of his Presence thru' all creation, fashioning her new love-realm in the mind of man, attempteth every mortal child with influences of her divine supremacy . . . ev'n as in a plant when the sap mounteth secretly and its wintry stalk breaketh out in the prolific miracle of Spring, or as the red blood floodeth into a beating heart to build the animal body comely and strong; so she in her transcendant rivalry would flush his spirit with pleasurable ichor of heaven: and where she hath found responsiv faculty in some richly favour'd soul— L'anima vaga delle cose belle, as saith the Florentine,—she wil inaugurate her feast of dedication, and even in thatt earliest onset, when yet infant Desire hath neither goal nor clue to fix the dream, ev'n then, altho' it graspeth nought and passeth in its airy vision away, and dieth out of remembrance, 'tis in its earnest of life and dawn of bliss purer and hath less of earthly tinge than any other after-attainment of the understanding: for all man's knowledge kenneth also of toil and flaw, and even his noblest works, tho' they illume the dark with individual consummation, are cast upon by the irrelevant black shadows of time and fate. Hence is the fascination of amateurs in art, who renouncing accomplishment attain the prize of their humbler devotion,—as Augustin saith, that fools may come at holiness where wise men miss, Facit enim hoc quaedam etiam stoliditas,— arriving by short-coming, like to homely birds of passage, nesting on the roofs of the workshops. And tho' of secret knowledge man's art is compáct, yet not the loving study of any master-work, nor longest familiarity can ever efface its birthday of surprisal; and great music to me is glorify'd by memory of one timeless hour when all thought fled scared from me in my bewilderment. So then the boy in first encounter with beauty, his nativ wonder awaken'd by the motion of love; as when live air, breathing upon a smother'd fire, shooteth the smouldering core with tiny flames—so he kindleth at heart with eternal expectancies, and the dream within him looketh out at his eyes. 'Twas thru' worship of Christ that this thing came to men, whereat, when art achieved portrayal of tenderness, the christian painters throng'd their heav'n with cherubims, little amorini, who with rebel innocence dispossess'd the tall angels; and Mary's young babe cast off his swaddling bands, and stood-up on her lap in grace of naked childhood for the image of God. But as 'tis with the Race, for which our hope draweth the only assurance of its high nobility from rare examples, holy men and wise, revered ev'n by the common folk, that none the less pursue their common folly interminably, and more and more pamper despair that is the giant sorrow of earth— so in the child this glimpse or touch of immanence, being a superlativ brief moment of glory, is too little to leaven the inveterate lump of life; and the instincts whose transform'd vitality should lust after spiritual things, return to their vomit and wallow in the mire of their animal ruts. Nature hath something truly of her promise in all: yet, in the infinit disposition of random seeds, her full potency is rare; as in the end of his book that maketh the old school-benches yet to sprout in green, Aristotle confesseth: where the teacher saith virtue cannot be taught to a mind not well disposed by natur, and he that hath thatt rarest excellence, ??? ????? ????? ??????, may be above all men styled truly fortunat; and with those four Greek words hath proudly prick'd to virtue many a sluggard soul. Forsooth the need of Fortune stayeth not here, alas! Ther is no assurance of stability or fair growth, unless she stand by faithfully and foster the soul, fending from all evil and encompassing with good, the while these intimations come to be understood and harmonized by Reason in the conduct of life. Now as Reason matured to the power of manhood, tutor'd by disciplin of natur, and ordering the accumulated scrutiny of physical flux in various sciences, so education of spirit, in the dignity of its creativ enthusiasms and honorable intelligence of Goddes gifts, mapp'd out its own science of conduct, aligning a pathway of happiness thru' the valley of death: and thatt science, call'd Ethick, dealing with the skill and manage of the charioteer in Plato's myth, rangeth up here in place for the parley of this book. Since all Ethick implyeth a sense of Duty in man, 'tis first to enquire whence that responsible ought arose; a call so universal and plain-spoken that some hav abstracted a special faculty, distinct from animal bias and underivable, whereby the creature kenneth the creator's Will, that, in stillness of sound speaking to gentle souls, dowereth all silence with the joy of his presence; but to men savage or superstitious a voice of horror, maleficent, inescapable, hounding them with fearful conviction of sin, as when Adam in Eden hid from the scour of God's eye. Which old tale of displeasur is true to life: because the imperativ obligation cannot be over-summ'd, being in itself the self-conscience of thatt Essence which is no other indeed than the prime ordinance that we call Law of Nature,—in its grade the same with the determin'd habit of electrons, the same with the determining instinct of unreasoning life, necessity become conscient in man—whereto all insubordination is imperfection in kind. Reality appeareth in forms to man's thought as several links interdependent of a chain that circling returneth upon itself, as doth the coil'd snake that in art figureth eternity. From Universal Mind the first-born atoms draw their function, whose rich chemistry the plants transmute to make organic life, whereon animals feed to fashion sight and sense and give service to man, who sprung from them is conscient in his last degree of ministry unto God, the Universal Mind, whither all effect returneth whence it first began. The Ring in its repose is Unity and Being: Causation and Existence are the motion thereof. Thru' out all runneth Duty, and the conscience of it is thatt creativ faculty of animal mind that, wakening to self-conscience of all Essences, closeth the full circle, where the spirit of man escaping from the bondage of physical Law re-entereth eternity by the vision of God. This absolution of Reason is not for all to see: But any man may picture how Duty was born, and trace thereafter its passage in the ethic of man. Ther is a young black ouzel, now building her nest under the Rosemary on the wall, suspiciously shunning my observation as I sit in the porch, intentiv with my pencil as she with her beak: Coud we discourse together, and wer I to ask for-why she is making such pother with thatt rubbishy straw, her answer would be surely: ‘I know not, but i must.’ Then coud she take persuasion of Reason to desist from a purposeless action, in but a few days hence when her eggs were to hatch, she would look for her nest; and if another springtide found us here again, with memory of her fault, she would know a new word, having made conscient passage from the must to the ought. I halt not then nor stumble at how the duteous call was gotten in course of nature, rather it lieth to show how it was after-shapen in man from physical to moral ends, and came no longer only to affirm but sometimes even to oppose the bidding of instinct, positing beside ought the equivalent ought nots, the stern forbiddances of those tables of stone that Moses fetch'd out of the thunder of Sinai. And since we see how man's judgment of Right and Wrong varieth with education—and thatt without effect to strengthen or weaken Duty—, we conclude therefrom that education shapeneth our moralities. And when and whereas Conscience transfigureth the Instincts —to affection, as aforesaid, from motherly selfhood, and to spiritual love from lust of breed—, we find Duty therewith extended in the moral field. Thus 'tis (as missionaries tell) that head-hunters who seek relish in refinement of cruelty, wil yet to soft feelings respond at gentle appeal: my dog would do as well, coud he understand my speech. Yet tho' we see how birds in catering for their young stint not their self-devotion, and punctiliously observe distributiv justice; and that dutiful dogs urged by conflicting calls wil stand awhile perplex'd in dumb deliberation—ne'ertheless, because the true spiritual combat is unknown to brutes, moralists teaching virtue as an end-in-itself repudiate any sanction from motivs engaged on animal welfare, and make utility a cant term of reproach; tho' on their higher plane spiritual conduct also is utilitarian: For virtue subserveth the soul's comfort and joy, therewithal no less useful, nay more requisit than is material comfort to our full happiness in self-realization of perfected nature; the which a sound doctrin of pleasur wil confirm. Denial of Use hath done our virtue wrong, while some belittle also our Ethick, saying the subject is of matter unknowledgeable in scientific sense, taking contingency from the imperfection of man. Granted, wer all men perfect, none would seek virtue; nor should I now debate of it; but neither again wer all omniscient, would any seek knowledge: yet go we hunting after truth insatiably as the Saints after holiness, who, comforted by least attainment, persevere,—Seeking the Lord whom they hav found: and if a check or fault show more in Ethick, 'tis that the hunter is on fuller cry after true happiness than after mental truth; or he thinketh at least to hav well nosed his desire, and he nameth his quarry ‘Satisfaction of soul.’ Whereas of absolute Truth, whatever that may be, or is, he hath not an inkling, nay nor any cause, save in spiritual faith, even to hope well of it. ('Tis for such lack of stand that deep thinkers, who plot intellectual approaches to the unknown, will lean unconsciously upon ethick, or in the end incline graciously towards it.) Now any deficiency is more discernible in an object known than in a thing unknown to us, and in the discussion of it ther is better likelihood of agreement. Altho' good disposition (as Aristotle hath it) may be by beauty educated, and aspire to theoretic wisdom (as Plato would teach) and Ethick therewithal claim honor of the same rank that ideal philosophy ascribeth to man, yet, if for lack of faith he sink that claim, I see a thing of hap without place in Reality. On no hand is't deny'd that terms of Right and Wrong are wholly pertinent to man's condition on earth; nor that, whatever his destiny may be, his origin was bestial and his first ethick a rudiment, that shifting ever and shaping in the story of man at every time is the index of his growth in grace; and, if the change of customs that the herd adopt for comfort and to insure what they most value in life, hath moral tendency upward, then that tendency is the animal sanction of virtue, and wil take honor as such. But Duty instill'd with order is so almighty of kind that 'twil make Law of Habit, whence all social codes outlast their turn and time, and in arrear of life hold the common folk backward from their nobler vaunt, lagging and dragging, whether as a garment outgrown tatter'd and foolish, or as strong fetters and chains wherein they lie fast-bound in misery and iron. Hence cometh all the need and fame of teachers, men of inborn nobility, call'd Prophets of God, Saviours of society, Seers of the promised land,— thatt white-filleted company that Aeneas found circled around Musæus in the Elysian fields, the loved and loveable whose names liv evermore, the sainted pioneers of salvation, unto whom all wisdom won and all man's future hope is due; and with inspiration of their ampler air we see our Ethick split up sheer and sharply atwain; two kinds diverse in kind ther be; the one of social need, lower, still holding backward in the clutch of earth, from old animal bondage unredeem'd; the other higher and spiritual, that by personal affiance with beauty hath made escape, soaring away to where the Ring of Being closeth in the Vision of God. Sticklers for equality wil hear nought of this, arguing that social is but a past-personal, personal a future-social, tenses of one verb, the amatum and amabo on the stem of ‘love,’ virtue's pure nativ stock which hath no need of graft; —a doctrin kindly at heart, that cajoleth alike diffidence of the ruler and conceit of the crowd, who in collusion float its credit; and awhile their ship of state runneth like the yacht in the race that with full bellying sail, for lack of seamanship, seemeth to forge ahead while it loseth leeway. No Politik admitteth nor did ever admit the teacher into confidence: nay ev'n the Church, with hierarchy in conclave compassing to install Saint Peter in Cæsar's chair, and thereby win for man the promises for which they had loved and worship'd Christ, relax'd his heav'nly code to stretch her temporal rule. For social Ethick with its legalized virtue is but in true semblance, alike for praise or blame, a friendly domestication of man's old wolf-foe, the adaptable subservient gentlemanly dog, beneath groom'd coat and collar in his passion unchanged. Thus 'tis that levellers, deeming all ethick one, and for being Socialists thinking themselves Teachers, can preach class-hatred as the enlighten'd gospel of love; but should they look to find firm scientific ground, whereon to found their creed in the true history of social virtue and of its progress hitherto, 'twil be with them in their research, as 'twas with him who yesteryear sat down in Mesopotamy to dig out Abram's birthplace in the lorn grave-yard of Asian monarchies;—and low hummocks of dust betray where legendary cities lie entomb'd, Chaldaean Kish and Ur; while for all life today poor nomads, with their sparse flotilla of swarthy tents and slow sand-faring camels, cruise listlessly o'erhead, warreners of the waste: Now this man duly unearth'd the walls whence Terah flitted, but beneath those walls more walls, and the elder buildings of a dynasty of wider rule than Abram knew, a nation extinct ere he was born: where-thru' sinking deeper their shafts the diggers came yet never on virgin soil, but still wondering on earlier walls, arches and masonry, a city and folk undremt of in archeology, trodden-under ere any story of man began; and there, happening on the king's tomb, they shovel'd from the dust the relics of thatt old monarch's magnificence— Drinking vessels of beaten silver or of clean gold, vases of alabaster, obsidian chalices, cylinder seals of empire and delicat gems of personal adornment, ear-rings and finger-rings, craftsmen's tools copper and golden, and for music a harp; withal in silver miniatur his six-oar'd skiff, a model in build and trim of such as ply today Euphrates' flowery marshes: all his earthly toys gather'd to him in his grave, that he might nothing lack in the unknown life beyond, but find ready to hand his jewel'd dice and gaming board and chamber-lamp, his toilet-box of paints and unguents—Therefore 'twas the chariot of his pride whereon he still would ride was buried with him; there lay yet the enamel'd film of the inlaid perish'd wood, and all the metal gauds that had emboss'd the rail: animal masks in gold, wild bulls and lions, and twin-figured on the prow great panther-heads to glare in silver o'er the course, impatient of their spring: and one rare master-work whose grace the old warrior wist not should outliv the name and fame of all his mighty doings, when he set it up thatt little nativ donkey, his mascot on the pole. 'Twas he who dug told me of these things and how, finding himself a housebreaker in the home of men who sixty hundred years afore, when they left life, had seal'd their tombs from sacrilege and there had lain, till from the secresy of their everlasting sleep he had torn the coverlet—his spirit, dazed awhile in wonder, suddenly was strick'n with great horror; for either side the pole, where lay the harness'd bones of the yoke-mated oxen, there beside their bones lay the bones of the grooms, and slaughter'd at their post all the king's body-guard, each liegeman spear in hand, in sepulchred attention; and whereby lay the harp the arm-bones of the player, as there she had pluck'd her dirge, lay mingled with its fragments; and nearby disposed, two rows of skeletons, her sisterly audience whose lavish ear-pendants and gold-filleted hair, the uniform decoration of their young service, mark'd them for women of the harem, sacrificed to accompany their lord, the day when he set forth to enter into the presence of the scepter'd shades congregated with splendour in the mansions of death. Leave Tigris now and Ur. Seek out our Aryan race by Gunga and Hydaspes in the teeming realm where Sakya Muni preach'd of gentleness and love, and took divinity before Christ came: see how at every Rajah's pyre, in Punjab or Kashmire, in Vijayanóggar, Kalikata and Udaipur, for liv-long centuries the mild Hindus hav burnt their multitudinous girl-concubines alive, and still beneath our lax imperial rule wil deem any honest outlawry of their ritual Suttee a tyrannous impiety of our western manners; which none the less withheld not of our island kings the last Henry, styled first Defendër of the Faith, from slaying his wives at will; nor was he for such crime less esteem'd of the folk; altho' judged as a man by pagan ethick or christian or by the insight of poet or historian, more despicable than we need to suppose that old monarch of Ur. See how cross-eyed the pride of our world-wide crusade against Nigerian slavery, while the London poor in their Victorian slums lodged closer and filthier than the outraged alien; and under liberty's name our Industry is worse fed and shut out from the sun.— In every age and nation a like confusion is found. IF DUTY held us long, now as in the old adage, Pleasure may follow after, taking like second rank in Plato's myth, as I twist it: wherein we traced Duty from the selfhood of individual life growing to reach communion with life eternal; while in the younger horse was pleasur intensified by love, until it issueth in the love of God. And yet hath pleasure truly its main stronghold in Self, because the greatest pleasure that man knoweth, is aye the pleasur of life, even as his chief displeasur is death. This Life-joy, like the breath-kiss of the all-ambient air unnoticed til the lack of it bring pain and death, is coefficient with the untrammel'd energy of nativ faculty, and the autometric scale of all functions and motions, which in the animal struggle for Self persistently against all hindrance: it is the lordly heraldry of the banner'd flower, in brutes the vaunt of vigour and the pose of pride, their wild impersonation of majesty; and in man the grace and ease of health alike in body and mind, thatt right congruity of his parts, for lack whereof his sanity is disabled maim'd and compromised. From personal pleasure then, seeing how good it is, and how a good man's pleasures all are good, it came an easy thought for men in quest of happiness to take it for their aim in all conduct, the account and logic of Ethick. So, flaunting their motto “Pleasure for pleasure's sake,” these doughty Hedonists, having got rid of whatsoever oldfashion'd king had ruled by right divine, chose out for his good looks and crown'd this gay pretender, against whose privilege men in the street and schoolmen are for once agreed; because none wil deny that some pleasures are bad, while all men honour them who for their honour's sake wil suffer pain, and risk the great displeasur of death. Pure Hedonism therefore is confuted off-hand; and its social pretension is but a will-o-the wisp; as if the honest pleasur of a wise man coud lie in furthering or conniving at the pleasur of them who know not ev'n their own unhappiness, nor how ere they can win happiness they must learn wisdom by paths difficult and to them unpleasurable. Nor is spiritual Hedonism in better plight, for some are found to take spiritual pleasur in crime. 'Twould seem then the prime task of Ethick to discern 'twixt pleasures good and bad: but first 'twer well to show how ever it came that Pleasure, being the champion of our integrity, should in the event appear virtue's insidious foe; for-sure ther is no knowledge in the wisdom of conduct cardinal as is this. Now in my thought the manner of it was on this wise— As Pleasure came in man to the conscience of self, his Reason abstracted it as an idea, and when he found the pleasur increasing with the conscience of it, he dwelt thereon, and seeking more and more to enrich his conscious pleasur, and bloating it with luxury, invented and indulged vices unknown to brutes. Thus was nature's intention thwarted: whereupon (seeing also how brooding upon sensual delight provoketh the desire, which, so long as the mind be but engaged healthily or distracted apart, would never rise to emotion) Moralists took fright, and Teachers banishing pleasure from Ethick, where they should hav been content with a danger-signal, posted a prohibition, and not only forbade pleasur as a motiv for any conduct, but ruled that any admixtur of intention or its chance presence deprived conduct of merit: whence pleasure with them, instead of being an in-itself absolute good as nature would have had it, and which man would wish to be always present and with his perfection increase, came to be bann'd as the pollution of virtue;—And so, when the young poet my companion in study and friend of my heart refused a peach at my hands, he being then a housecarl in Loyola's menie, 'twas that he fear'd the savor of it, and when he waived his scruple to my banter, 'twas to avoid offence. But I, upon thatt day which after fifty years is near as yesterday, was no stranger to fear of pleasure, but had grown fearful of thatt fear; yet since the sublimation of life whereto the Saints aspire is a self-holocaust, their sheer asceticism is justified in them; the more because the bent and nativ color of mind that leadeth them aloof, or driveth, is thatt very delicacy of sense, whereby a pinprick or a momentary whiff or hairbreadth motion freëth the detent of force that can distract them wholly from their high pursuit: wherefor they fly God's garden, whose forbidden fruit (seemeth to them) was sweeten'd by a fiend's desire to make them fond and foolish. Nature ne'ertheless singeth loud in her prison, and for all ecstasy these mystics find no language but to echo again the psalm of her captivity; nay, furthermore, the doctrin esoteric in their rapt divines and their diviner poets—this the novice knew— is the rëincarnation of their renounced desire. The repudiation of pleasur is a reason'd folly of imperfection. Ther is no motiv can rebate or decompose the intrinsic joy of activ life, whereon all function whatsoever in man is based. Consider how this mortal sensibility hath a wide jurisdiction of range in all degrees, from mountainous gravity to imperceptible faintest tenuities:—The imponderable fragrance of my window-jasmin, that from her starry cup of red-stemm'd ivory invadeth my being, as she floateth it forth, and wantoning unabash'd asserteth her idea in the omnipotent blaze of the tormented sun-ball, checquering the grey wall with shadow-tracery of her shapely fronds; this frail unique spice of perfumery, in which she holdeth monopoly by royal licence of Nature, is but one of a thousand angelic species, original beauties that win conscience in man: a like marvel hangeth o'er the rosebed, and where the honeysuckle escapeth in serpentine sprays from its dark-cloister'd clamber thru' the old holly-bush, spreading its joybunches to finger at the sky in revel above rivalry. Legion is their name; Lily-of-the-vale, Violet, Verbena, Mignonette, Hyacinth, Heliotrope, Sweet-briar, Pinks and Peas, Lilac and Wallflower, or such white and purple blooms that sleep i' the sun, and their heavy perfumes withhold to mingle their heart's incense with the wonder-dreams, love-laden prayers and reveries that steal forth from earth, under the dome of night: and tho' these blossomy breaths, that hav presumed the title of their gay genitors, enter but singly into our neighboring sense, that hath no panorama, yet the mind's eye is not blind unto their multitudinous presences:—I know that if odour were visible as color is, I'd see the summer garden aureoled in rainbow clouds, with such warfare of hues as a painter might choose to show his sunset sky or a forest aflame; while o'er the country-side the wide clover-pastures and the beanfields of June would wear a mantle, thick as when in late October, at the drooping of day the dark grey mist arising blotteth out the land with ghostly shroud. Now these and such-like influences of tender specialty must not—so fine they be— fall in neglect and all their loveliness be lost, being to the soul deep springs of happiness, and full of lovingkindness to the natural man, who is apt kindly to judge of good by comfortable effect. Thus all men ever hav judged the wholesomness of food from the comfort of body ensuing thereupon, whereby all animals retrieve their proper diet; but if when in discomfort 'tis for pleasant hope of health restored we swallow nauseous medicines, so mystics use asceticism, and no man readier than they to assert eventual happiness to justify their conduct. Whence it is not strange (for so scientific minds in search of truth digest assimilable hypotheses) they should extend their pragmatism, and from their happiness deduce the very existence and the natur of God, and take religious consolation for the ground of faith: as if the pleasur of life wer the sign-manual of Nature when she set her hand to her covenant. But man, vain of his Reason and thinking more to assure its independence, wil disclaim complicity with human emotion; and regarding his Mother deemeth it dutiful and nobler in honesty coldly to criticize than purblindly to love; and in pride of this quarrel he hath been led in the end to make distinction of kind 'twixt Pleasur and Happiness; observing truly enough how one may hav pleasure and yet miss happiness; but this warpeth the sense and common use of speech, since all tongues in the world call children and silly folk happy and sometimes ev'n brutes. The name of happiness is but a wider term for the unalloy'd conditions of the Pleasur of Life, attendant on all function, and not to be deny'd to th'soul, unless forsooth in our thought of nature spiritual is by definition unnatural. But I would not thus wrong nature; rather say I that as man realizeth his higher energies, the quality and value of his pleasures wil so change, that tho' the animal life-joy persist thru'out, yet his transported joy developing thereon cometh by excellence to need a special term. And Aristotle in his tenth book thus summeth it— “Whatso thatt faculty may be which hath in man “natural governance and apprehendeth things “noble and divine,—it is the energy (so saith he) “of thatt faculty in its proper excellence, which is “the Perfect Happiness;” and with his predicate he assumeth the less perfect also, and lower states. But these philosophers—their Ethick being concern'd with man's perfection—used the abstracted terms whereby they had pre-defined distinctions, which as they diverged in separat culmination obscured identity. 'Twas for that reason, I guess, that Aristotle himself so harpeth on his doctrin, as if he was aware that his conclusion had somehow miss'd its full premiss: But if we see Spiritual, Mental and Animal to be gradations merged together in growth and mix'd in their gradations, and that the animal pleasure runneth thru'out all grades heartening all energies, then Aristotle's wisdom goeth without saying; and the actual complexity of human conduct wil appear nature's order in the condition of growth; and so the trouble and wonderment of baulk'd insight may all be presently sponged from the treatises. Altho' in the distinction of pleasures good and bad the unparagon'd nobility of the great virtues standeth without controversy among them that know —who instill them as duties—, yet they hav writ no rule nor rubric whereby conduct can in lesser affairs accommodate these principles, when they conflict in upright personalities, nor square their use with the intricat contingencies that knit our lives, and the interaction of unrelated sequences. In that uncharted jungle a good man wil go right, while an ill disposition wil miss and go wrong: yet in the worst we still may find something to praise, in the lame child that stumbleth, or the canker'd bud; ev'n the poor blasted promise of desiderat fruit hath true relation to the absent beauty thereof. Forever on the asses bridge and in the ship of fools life is agog; and there the Muse hath set her stage, and in humorous compact with philosophy hideth her godlike face beneath a grinning mask, and donning the gay motley of idiotic man empersonateth him in his chance dilemmas; by the eternal comedy of the unfitness of things beguiling the disconsolat with sympathy and cheering contemplation with æsthetic mirth. Full many hav found happiness toiling all their time thus disporting with truth; and at carving such toys hav thru' love of children become Teachers of men: But here I wol nat han to do of swich matere. Since then all promise of spiritual advancement lieth in two things, good disposition and (as 'twas said) right education, it followeth here to speak of these. First then of Disposition.—Unless there truly be more good than bad absolutely in the make of man, ther is no security for him and little hope, except the inherent harmony and unity of good be such as must in the end outweigh the surplusage of all discordant enmity; and this well may be: but should we inquire if Nature hath by any means inclined man's disposition to the virtuous choice, we may find how she hath done this, and by the energy of the imitativ faculty hath assured her end. “For Mimicry is inborn in man from childhood up: “and in this differeth he from other animals, “being the most imitativ: and his first approach “to learning maketh he in mimicry, and hath delight “in imitations of all kinds.” I would indeed that Aristotle had set this pregnant verity in forefront of his Ethick also, as now 'tis found to stablish his Poetick; for the assumption of it here and there in the Morals escapeth notice, and all the consequences thereof are unseen. But if the cradled child imitateth the shows that happen around him, he for-sure will most attend to those that most attract, and must therefore be drawn and held by the inborn love of Beauty inconsciently of preference to imitate the more beautiful things. And because Virtue is an activity, and lieth not in doctrin and theory but in practice and conduct, co-ordinating potencies into energy, (and here 'tis Aristotle again speaketh, not I) the preferential imitation of right action is the habit of virtue: and thus a child well-bred in good environment, so soon as he is aware of personality, wil know and think himself a virtuous being and instinctivly, in the proud realization of Self common to all animals, becometh to be his own ideal, a such-a-one as would will and do this (saith he) and never do thatt, refraining there from shame, consenting here for love, winning new beauty of soul from the embrace of beauty, and strength by practised combat against folly and wrong, to perfect as he may his idea of himself. Spiritual life being thus imagin'd in the child thru' conscient personality and love of beauty, —which on so tender a plant budding hath power to bear the richest fruit of all creation, incomparable— ther is nought in all his nurtur of more intrinsic need than is the food of Beauty: as mammals milk to his flesh, which admitteth no proxy, so Beauty is to his soul, that calleth for this comforting of nature's breast, tho' its outcries be unheard when it pineth in pain: and since the hunger of mimicry is so strong in him, that in the lack of milk 'twil ravin gall, and draw infection and death from evil as quickly as life from good, the first intrinsic need in education is found. Thus Christ, who knew what was in man and taught man's perfect happiness to be the wonted realm of heav'n within his heart, spake thus Take h?de (he said) Se that ye offende not won of these litell wons: and once again on this wise, “If ther be any sin “unpardonable even in the wide compassion of God, “'tis the denial and blasphemy of his Holy Spirit, “and the quenching in others of its nascent flame.” Delicat and subtle are the dealings of nature, whereby the emotionable sense secretly is touch'd to awareness and by glimpse of heav'nly vision drawn within the attraction of the creativ energy that is the ultimat life of all being soe'er: While Science sitteth apart in her exile, attent on her other own invisibles; and working back to the atoms, she handleth their action to harness the gigantic forces of eternal motion, in serviceable obedience to man's mortal needs; and not to be interrupted nor call'd off her task, dreaming, amid the wonders of her sightly works, thru' her infinitesimals to arrive at last at the unsearchable immensities of Goddes realm. But while the intellectual faculty is yet unborn, spiritual things to children are even as Music is, thatt firstborn pleasur of animal conscience that now hath for its human honour its origin forgot; the which a child absorbeth readily and without thought, tho' in after years, if thatt initiation hav lack'd, scarce can a man by grammar come at the elements. Their twain affinity may be seen also in this, that both are companied by the same full delight of progress in performance, while the same method serveth for both; if but the teacher be himself virtuous or musical—an examplar as such, he wil be keenly follow'd, and often in his love that his pupil surpass him is his best reward. Of intellectual training 'tis not here to tell; thatt cometh later, and then the trouble is evermore the lack of teachers; yet wer teachers plentiful, and gentle environment as common as bramble-scrub, never coud human wit discern to accommodate the countless idiosyncracies of mind withal; indeterminable are they and never can be told. But 'twer well to consider in what a fusty crypt the awakening mind is caged when—like a butterfly that newly hath slipp'd its crysalis to sport i' the sun— it thrusteth out its finely adapted tentacles in their first palping movements to the encounter of life, with confidence exploring its nativ yearnings. How, when this apprehensiv expectancy is met by fenced obstruction! How, when ev'n the syllables which with such duteous pains the child had learn'd to tongue, the secret spell whereat the fabled treasure-house should open its doors—how, when thatt magic Sesamë hath proved a foreign jargon and, like a rusty key, by long mishandling already hath hamper'd the lock! How should not childish effort, thus thwarted and teased, recoil dishearten'd bruized and stupefy'd beneath the rough-shod inculcation of inculcated minds, case-harden'd by their own thoughtless reiterations? The mud-fish may be happy and at home in the pond, but live Imagination, conscient of its joy, ranketh oft with the dunces in such scholarship, finding its happiness in freedom to mature the personality of its nativ potency. Others in after-growth at heavy cost repair their early damage, since in intellectual things all errors are remediable; but 'tis not so in the spiritual life, nay ev'n the soul wash'd pure of absorb'd taint may take a strange gloss of the lye. Of two young thoro'breds galoping neck to neck I'd choose the colt that with least effort held his course. Of two runners abreast my liking would crown him who had greater grace of limb and show'd no trouble of face, tho' he by such complacency might miss the prize: But virtue in the soldier is the martyr's heart that, battling for supremacy, out-stayeth defeat, firing the citadel ere he yield it to the foe: and 'tis nobility that pulleth our favour upon the weaker side in any unequal match. Now in spiritual combat, altho' I must deem them the most virtuous who with least effort excell, yet, virtue being a conflict, moralisers hold that where conflict is hardest virtue must be at best; and in the rub of life and physical hindrance a man who has striven heroically and done great deeds, in spite of frailty or bodily disease or pain, may win more admiration and praise in the end than he who with comfort to himself, indolently as it wer, hath done as well; nay, for the very impediments may ev'n be envied, as old navigators were in the glory they had got to hav outridden their storms. And yet from Zion's hill-top to the Dead-Sea shore, between the Teacher sitting on the Mount and them, the nethermost unfortunats, that cannot learn,— in all the mid-mass crowding on the flowery slopes, hearers o' the Word, ther is little difference to be told: The same incarnat traitor routeth in all hearts; nay, since 'tis an æsthetic delicacy of mind that, refining the enticement of carnal pleasure, voideth the shame, the elect are oft in straits extreme: the mastery of warriorship, their apparent grace, was won by disciplin of deadly strife: in them ease is no indolence: indolence rather is theirs who, ill-disposed to training, are unexercised in good habit of war; and 'tis the lack thereof maketh the soldier unready and the conflict so hard, rather than any unwonted virulence or rage of the onslaught; for thatt same happeneth anon to all. AND here my thought plungeth into the darksome grove and secret penetralia of ethic lore, wherein I hav wander'd often and long and thought to know my way, and now shall go retracing my remember'd paths, tho' no lute ever sounded there nor Muse hath sung, deviously in the obscure shadows, and none follow me entering where erst I enter'd, and all enter free, at the great clearing made by Socrates of yore, when he said know thyself; for true to his chief premiss that ignorance is the root of all men's folly, he taught to turn the lamp of Reason inwardly upon the mind. And truly with thatt keen ????? ??????? of his was great felling of trees: for not Socrates knew nor any hath ever kenn'd how man thinketh; and less how thought thinketh itself; nor how in thatt province Reason hath right to rule; nor of what stuff the reins can be, wherewith the Charioteer bridled the steeds in that same vision of his which Plato saith he told to Phaedrus, as they sat together on the banks of the Ilissus talking of the passions of men. All terrestrial Life, in all functions and motions, operateth thru' alliance of living entities disparate in their structure but logically correlated in action under some final cause. Suchlike co-ordinations may be acquired in man with reason'd purpose consciently, as when a learner on viol or flute diligently traineth his hand to the intricat fingering of the stops and strings; or may be innate, as the spontaneous flight of birds; or antenatal and altogether inconscient, as the food-organs, call'd vegetativ because such cellular connivance is the life of plants. The main co-ordinations whereon life hangeth were ever automatous, and such states when acquired tend to become self-working as they are perfected, dropping out of our ken: the proverb truly spake Habit is second nature, and 'twil function best without superintendence, for the least brain-wave or timid rippling of self-consciousness can rob the bodily movements of their nativ grace. Now these perfected unify'd organities, whether of inconscient birth or such as when acquired proudly stand off from conscience, all act in response to external stimulants that vary in kind, and range from mere material contact to untraceable thought. Thus the digestiv kind is stirr'd by touch of food within the body, or by the sight or sound or smell of the object, or ev'n by the unconscious thought thereof; and thence thru' appetite by mere thought of the sense; and can decipher a message in the secret code of language, and prick up at sound of the symbol: For never can those privy-councilors in the brain withhold official knowledge from the corporat mind; ther is no deliberation or whisper'd thought, not ev'n unspoken intention among them, but it will leak out to thatt swarming intelligence where life began, and where ideas wander at liberty to find their procreativ fellowship; thatt fluid sea in which all problems, spiritual or logical æsthetic mathematic or practic, resolve melting as icebergs launch'd on the warm ocean-stream: and wheresoe'er this corporat alchemy is at best, 'tis call'd by all men genius, and its aptitudes like virtuous disposition may be inherited. Thus must all kind of stimulus hav come some way across the misty march-land, whereon men would fix their disputable boundary between Matter and Mind, —as every sensation must suffer translation ere it can mediate in the live machinery of any final cause or purpose: whence 'twould seem that science went astray thinking to appropriate some nervous reactions wholly to her material sphere, and rather should hav thought to extend the mental field. Now this spontaneous life oweth nought to Reason (the conscient faculty which Socrates invoked); and so her claim to be the “very consciousness of things judging themselves” is “vain above measure”: for every Essence hath its own Idea, and so cometh thereby to its own full conscient life in man: for-sure the idea of Beauty is not Reason's idea, nor hath Reason the idea of Courage or of Mirth, of Faith or Love or Poetry or of Music's delight; if Reason as an essence owneth to any idea, let her make good her claim and therewith be content: so be it; and surely Reason's property will be the idea of Order;—and ifso, I think to find how by the very natur of her own faculty she was deceived to imagin its universal scope; for since all natur is order'd (nor none will deny that 'tis by Reason alone we are of such order aware), all things must of their ordinance come in her court for judgment; and 'twas thus Pythagoras coud hold number to be the universal essence of things: nay, see the starry atoms in the seed-plot of heaven stripp'd to their nakedness are nothing but Number; and see how Mathematick rideth as a queen cheer'd on her royal progress thru'out nature's realm; see how physical Science, which is Reason's trade and high profession, booketh ever and docketeth all things in order and pattern; how Philosophy, shuttling out in the unknown like a hungry spider, blindly spinneth her geometric webs, testing and systematizing even her own disorders, her solipsism and her gossamer ontologies gnostic or cabbalist: and 'twas thus Socrates coud evoke Reason to order and disciplin the mind— the divine Logos that should shine in the darkness,— a good physician who must heal himself withal. [The assumed docility is by English moralists term'd the ‘Good Will’ and fetch'd in as 'twer from without; yet 'tis but the old animal instinct of selfhood to'ard realisation, which continueth on with the animal promoted to spiritual life; wherein desire for betterment is the promise and premiss of all virtue; or if the willingness be but desire of knowledge, thatt will find the goal where Truth and Virtue and Beauty are all as one.] Now seeing the aim of Socrates we must inquire what the Mind's cóntents are; how disorder'd; and why ther should in the good mind be any disorder at all. What the mind is, this thing bidden to know itself? First I bethink me naturally of every man as a unique creature, a personality in whom we lucidly distinguish body and mind, and talk readily of either tho' inseparable and mutually dependent, together or apart the created expression of Universal Mind. And of the body I think as the machinery of our terrestrial life evolving towards conscience in the Ring of Reality; and thence of the mind as thatt evolved conscience, the which in every-one is different, as the body differeth also in each. And human Intellect I see form'd and compact of the essential Ideas, wherewith soever each man hath come in contact personally, and in so far as he is kindly disposed to absorb their influences to build his personality; and since all ideas come to him thru' the senses, thatt old proviso nisi ipse intellectus is futile to me; for intellectus here seemeth to exclude itself, as being thatt all-receptiv conscient energy which is the mind of man; thatt ultimat issue of the arch-creativ potency of Being, wherefrom the senses took existence. Thus I come to think that if the mind held all ideas in plenitude 'twould be complete, at one with natur and harmonized with as good harmony as we may find in nature. Now as our optic science teacheth pure white light to be the consummation of all the colour-bands into which by diffraction it can be separated, whereof if any ray went missing, the sunlight wer impure and imperfect (or so we may think); a suchlike imperfection must be in all men's minds, because the complemental ideas parcel'd in each are incomplete, being only such as that one man may hav happ'd on, and those only in the measure whereby he is tuned to take cognisance of them: thus it is all men differ each from each, since neither environment nor disposition can ever in any two men be the same or alike, and therefor (as was said) true individuality within the species would seem reach'd in mankind. Again likewise 'tis seen how national mentalities are mutually incomprehensible and irreconcilable; since each group as it rose was determin'd apart by conditions of life which none other coud share, by climate, language, and historic tradition estranging evermore; nor are such obstinat bonds the weaker for any intrinsic absurdity: Nay, see the Armenian folk in their snow-burrows, as if distrustful of their high mountainous plateau between the seas, hav riveted their patriotism by stubborn adherence to an ancient heresy, a paradoxy anent the two natures of Christ, which some theologic bishop, peering in the fog of his own exhalations, thought pleasing to God; altho' no creature might possibly understand it. Again from this same cause it wil follow no less that men commonly run so near to the average; for the animal ideas are common property and, being the greatest common measure of all mankind, wil stand-out as the mean statistical features. Again we now may see—and 'tis pleasant to see— how simple characters hav such extreme beauty, for that the soul's nobility consisteth not in riches of imagination or intellect but in harmony of Essences, which hath full power where a few fundamentals in purity attain their self-cöordination; as honest pots and pans may for their unsophisticated beauty excell a prize diploma-picture of our academy: like as in music, when true voices blend in song, the perfect intonation of the major triad is sweetest of all sounds; its inviting embrace resolveth all discords; and all the ambitious flights of turbulent harmony come in the end to rest with the fulfilment of its liquidating cloze. Again we hence rebutt that old dilemma of Art, which would set man in lordly enmity against nature for that his pensiv play transcendeth her beauty; —as when Sebastian preludeth, all her voices that ever have reach'd our ears crest-fal'n and abash'd: for tho' man cannot wield her infinit resource of delicacy and strength, yet hath he in lieu thereof a range triumphant, where his exorbitant thought defying Space and Time hath power to blend all things visible and invisible, and freely redispose every essence that he knoweth, to parcel them at will— or so he thinketh—,like an occult magician whose summons all spirits must attend and obey, from the heart-blaze of heaven to the unvisited deep; tho' he hav no wizardry to exorcise them withal. Now this dilemma (I say) is rebutted hereby, because man's faculty of creation, rare in him and not at his command, is but Nature herself, who danceth in her garden at the blossoming-time 'mong the flowers of her setting; and tho' true it be that Art needeth as full devotion and diligence in the performance as doth Virtue, yet i' the mind of the artist Nature's method surely is on this wise;— the Ideas which thru' the senses hav found harborage, being come to mortal conscience work-out of themselves their right co-ordinations and, creativly seeking expression, draw their natural imagery from the same sensuous forms whereby they found entrance; thus linking up with all the long tradition of Art. The manner of this magic is purest in musick, but by the learner is seen more clearly in poetry, wherein each verbal symbol exposeth its idea; so that 'tis manifest by what promptings of thought the imaginativ landscape is built and composed, and how horizon'd: And the secret of a poem lieth in this intimat echo of the poet's life. Now in its selfcreativeness the manner of Art cannot be simulated, altho' Mimicry is Beauty's cradle: But, as in the Spirit of Man all manner of grades are found, so wil it be in his Art, with such disorder of thought as is not here to tell; for every man, whom Beauty hath laid beneath her spell, —tho' but by glimpse or dream, and him full ignorant of what idea hath moved him and even by what means;— wil feel about to express some mintage of himself, by imitation or birdlike hymeneal lilt, to fix his hold on joy, his cogito ergo sum. Thus may a jingle of words fasten his faith on God, as schoolboys memorize their lesson better in rhyme. Inasmuch then as the ideas in any one mind are a promiscuous company muster'd at random, ther wil be such disorder as Reason can perceive and may hav skill to amend; but tho' we grant her art valid in principle and salutary in effect, the debit of failure is heavy in her accounts. Yet we discredit not all Medicine because ther be incurable maladies that end in death,— nor yet because the leech, when he is call'd in to heal an indigestiv stomach, can hav no dealing directly with the embroil'd co-ordinating cells,— and, for the lack of any intelligent knowledge of their intimat bickerings, wil hav recourse to palliativs and sentimental assurances of favorable conditions, exercise and air, hoping thus to entice them to a better behaviour,— or observing some chemical excess in their chyme wil deftly neutralize it with a pinch of salt; so we shall also allow Reason her claim to rule: and to judge by oneself, as each man must, I find Reason wil diagnose the common ailment of Mind a lack of harmony; for with the Ideas at war —now one Idea in mastery and now another, acting at call o' the moment indiscriminatly,— the man is foolish, unreasonable as we say, inept, without set purpose, weak of will; whereas if all should work together in concert, he wil be determin'd and consistent: And I see man's Will is here no independent concentrated force, like the steel spring box'd up in a French clock and wound for local distribution, but is rather itself the concentrating of a predistributed intrinsic power;—the emotions, passions and desires, concurrent with the Ideas, being surely of themselves wilful enough, and able among themselves at strife to make a fool, and in co-ordination a sage. Will, then, in the good mind a sustain'd harmony, is in the bad a dissonance, or it may be a strange co-ordination, or the tyranny of one idea; from which our great civic convulsions mostly arise and popular rebellions, when the Demagog hath fulminated some mighty essential idea, which entereth wildly into the loose minds of the herd and, finding there no governance, runneth riot and, drawing all wilful authority to itself, wil seem the only live thing; like a firebrand at night flaring afar, that in the sunlight wer a troublous smoke: and if such insurrection by contagion attain predominance uncontrollable, to the overthrow of any existing rule, then the Will of the folk is dubb'd by history's pen the will of god. But since this over-mastering prevalent idea may be good in itself while it wreaketh but wrong, and since I see that all human activities may be order'd equally for ravage or defence, Reason herself here questioneth me how I trust her mere ordering of life to make for happiness— whereto my answer is my good faith in what I hav writ. How the mind of man from inconscient existence cometh thru' the animal by growth of reasoning to'ard spiritual conscience hath been duly told: And Reason—being essentially (as in place 'twas found) the idea of Order, and thus itself the appurtenance of essences, with them passing from physical unto spiritual order in a mind endued with conscience of the higher spiritual essences— Reason (say I) wil rise to awareness of its rank in the Ring of Existence, where man looketh up to the first cause of all; and wil itself decree and order discreetly the attitude of the soul seeking self-realization in the vision of God, becoming at the last thatt arch-conscience of all, to which the Greek sage who possess'd it made appeal. The attraction of this motion is our conscience of it, our love of wisdom and of beauty; and the attitude of those attracted wil be joyful obedience with reverence to'ard the omnificent Creator and First Cause, whose Being is thatt beauty and wisdom which is to be apprehended only and only approach'd by right understanding of his creation, and found in thatt habit of faith which some thinkers hav styled The Life of Reason; and this only true bond of love and reasonable relation (if relation ther be) 'twixt creature and creator, man and nature's God, the which we call Religion,—is fundamental, physically and metaphysically in fashion or force undistinguishable from Duty itself: sprung from the same primal reality, it also aborted in like dolorous superstition, when the first-born intimations of spiritual life scared man's animal mind, that in childish terror seeking protection from the unseen, fenced his dark cave with codes of fearful fantasy and—flush'd by the stir of the irresistible impulse which drave him (yea, still driveth) with fierce exultation (albeit we may deplore thatt barbarous aberration),—with credulous magic cloggeth his airy spirit and discrediteth his Reason and Faith alike . . . so old a trouble and great that the honest indictment of the Epicurean goeth unrefuted, and his famous verse tantum religio potuit suadere malorum yet ringeth true as when he thought to benefit mankind, and from his woes rescue him for ever, drowning the thought of God from off the face of the earth in his deluge of atoms; and made in the mind a second Void, the which his sect should keep inane by the inventiv levity of their enlightenment; til, as with animals that hav fasted too long and aking within for their emptiness wil eat too greedily, we see in our fellows today fresh recrudescence of forgonn superstition; the while our generation, sicken'd by the grime of murky slums, slagheaps and sooty bushes, wil plan garden-cities and for her soilure make reddition to Nature, replanting the fair lands which our industrial grandsires disaforested. This hankering after lost Beauty, in sickness of heart a disconsolat sentiment, is the remnant grace of nature's covenant, the starved germ athirst for God ev'n for the living God, that singeth in the psalm quemadmodum cervus, and now amidst the blank tyranny of ugliness maketh many a rebel pining for enlargement and plotting to recall thatt old arrant exile who, for all her mischief, hid neath her cloak the master-key of happiness. In truth “spiritual animal” wer a term for man nearer than “rational” to define his genus; Faith being the humanizer of his brutal passions, the clarifier of folly and medicine of care, the clue of reality, and the driving motiv of thatt self-knowledge which teacheth the ethick of life. And yet hath prayer, the heav'n-breathing foliage of faith, found never a place in ethick: for Philosophy filtering out delusions from her theory of life, in dread of superstition gave religion away to priests and monks, who rich in their monopoly furbish and trim the old idols, that they dare not break, for fear of the folk and need of good disciplin. But since all men alike, in any strain of heart or great emotion of soul, credulous or sceptic, fall instinctivly to prayer for thatt solace and strength which they who use the habit may be seen to hav found— nay, had Prayer no effect other than reverence for the self-knowledge, which the Greek enjoin'd, whereby 'tis sovran to bind character, concentrate Will, and purify intention—nay, ev'n so 'twould claim a place among the causes of determin'd flux. Ah! tho' it may be a simple thing in reach of all, Best ever is rare, a toilsome guerdon; and prayer is like those bodily exercises that athletes wil use, which each must humbly learn, and ere he win to power so diligently practice, and in such strict course as wil encroach unkindly on the agreements of life: whence men slouch in the laxity that they call ease, rather than rouse to acquiring thatt strength, without which the body cannot know the pleasur of its full ease, the leisur of strength in the hard labor of life. Now every emotion hath the bodily expression beseeming each; and since the body cannot be without some attitude, so Prayer wil hav its own: and here just as in any athletic exercise ther be postures and motions foolish in themselves and often undignified, so too the postur of prayer may shame our pride of spirit, which would grudge the limbs warrant of entry upon her sacred solitudes; albeit the body come there in full abject guize to do submission and pay fealty to the soul: And since our speech, in its mere vocal cries and calls, hath less natural beauty and true significance than the bodily gestures which convey our desires, so ev'n the words of prayer wil lack in dignity and seem impertinent; as full often they be, and ever had been, unless man's language had upgrown from makeshift unto mastery of his thought, and learn'd by its fine musing art to redeem for his soul the beauty of holiness, marrying creativly his best earthly delight with his heav'nliest desire, when he calleth on God, Send forth thy light and truth that they may lead me and bring me unto thy Holy Hill, to thatt fair place which is the joy of the whole earth. See! ther is never dignity in a concourse of men, save only as some spiritual gleam hearteneth the herd. Any idea whatsoe'er new-born to consciousness, if it infect the folk, taketh repetend life and exuberant difformity of disorder'd growth from physical communion of emotion and thought; and of its nascent appetency 'twil embrace affinity in its host, to stagger and eliminate all other ideas, thus improportionably surmounting its own province in Nature's order; so that unless itself it be a thing of Beauty, insurmountable of kind, more beauteous in excess— as when the glow reverberating in a golden cup multiplyeth the splendour,—it cometh that the herd, being in its empassionment ever irrational, wil even of harmless enthusiasm breed disgrace. Thus in our English sport, the spectacular games, where tens of thousands flock throttling the entrance-gates like sheep to th'pen, wherein they sit huddled to watch the fortune of the football, ther is often here and there mid the seething glomeration of thatt ugly embankment of gazing faces, one that came to enjoy the sight knowingly, and yet looketh never on the contest: to him the crowd is the spectacle; its wrestle and agony is more than the actors, and its contagion so thick and irresistible, that ere he feel surprise he too may find himself, yea philosophy and all, carried away—as when a strong swimmer in the sea who would regain the shore, is by the headlong surf toss'd out of action, and like a drifted log roll'd up breathless and unresisting on the roaring beach. But if he join the folk, when at the cloze of Lent they kneel in the vast dimness of a city church, while on the dense silence the lector's chant treadeth from cadence to cadence the long dolorous way of the great passion of Christ,—or anon when they rise to free their mortal craving in the exultant hymn that ringeth with far promise of eternal peace . . . or should it happen to him, in strange lands far from home, to watch the Moslem host, when at their hour of prayer they troop in wild accoutrement their long-drill'd line motionless neath the sun upon the Arabian sands, hush'd to th'Imám's solemnel invocation of God, as their proud tribal faith savagely draweth strength from the well-spring of life,—then at the full Amen of their deep-throated respond he wil feel his spirit drawn into kinship and their exaltation his own; the more that he himself can be no part thereof, incomprehensible because comprehending: —and they be muddied pools whereat the herd water. Such is the dignity of prayer in the common folk; and its humility is the robe of intellect. So whenever it hath been by some mystics renounced in sanctuary of their sublime abstraction—as if utter abnegation had left no manners else to abjure,— they appear to lack in use and duty of fellowship. Yet in such solitaries, pallid clerks of heaven, souls blanch'd for lack of sunjoys (as 'twould seem to hav been), their contemplation (it may be) of very intensity generateth ideas of higher irradiance; for ideas born to human personality, having their proper attractions like as atom or cell, from soul to soul pass freely; and 'twas this mystery, whereof they kenn'd the need who set that clause i' the creed, which, compelling belief in the communion of saints, foldeth the sheep in pastures of eternal life. Nor doubt I that as this thinking machinery perisheth with the body, so animal thought with all its whimper and giggle must perish therewith, with all shames, all vain ostentation and ugliness, and all personality of all other ideas; except it be that, like as in unconscient things whence conscience came, ther is also thru'out conscient life the same emergent evolution, persisting in our spiritual life to the goal of conscience. This mind perisheth with this body, unless the personal co-ordination of its ideas hav won to Being higher than animal life, at thatt point where the Ring cometh upward to reach the original creativ Energy which is God, with conscience entering into life everlasting. 'TWAS at thatt hour of beauty when the setting sun squandereth his cloudy bed with rosy hues, to flood his lov'd works as in turn he biddeth them Good-night; and all the towers and temples and mansions of men face him in bright farewell, ere they creep from their pomp naked beneath the darkness;—while to mortal eyes 'tis given, ifso they close not of fatigue, nor strain at lamplit tasks—'tis given, as for a royal boon to beggarly outcasts in homeless vigil, to watch where uncurtain'd behind the great windows of space Heav'n's jewel'd company circleth unapproachably— 'Twas at sunset that I, fleeing to hide my soul in refuge of beauty from a mortal distress, walk'd alone with the Muse in her garden of thought, discoursing at liberty with the mazy dreams that came wavering pertinaciously about me; as when the small bats, issued from their hangings, flitter o'erhead thru' the summer twilight, with thin cries to and fro hunting in muffled flight atween the stars and flowers. Then fell I in strange delusion, illusion strange to tell; for as a man who lyeth fast asleep in his bed may dream he waketh, and that he walketh upright pursuing some endeavour in full conscience—so 'twas with me; but contrawise; for being in truth awake methought I slept and dreamt; and in thatt dream methought I was telling a dream; nor telling was I as one who, truly awaked from a true sleep, thinketh to tell his dream to a friend, but for his scant remembrances findeth no token of speech—it was not so with me; for my tale was my dream and my dream the telling, and I remember wondring the while I told it how I told it so tellingly. And yet now 'twould seem that Reason inveigled me with her old orderings; as once when she took thought to adjust theology, peopling the inane that vex'd her between God and man with a hierarchy of angels; like those asteroids wherewith she later fill'd the gap 'twixt Jove and Mars. Verily by Beauty it is that we come at wisdom, yet not by Reason at Beauty: and now with many words pleasing myself betimes I am fearing lest in the end I play the tedious orator who maundereth on for lack of heart to make an end of his nothings. Wherefor as when a runner who hath run his round handeth his staff away, and is glad of his rest, here break I off, knowing the goal was not for me the while I ran on telling of what cannot be told. For not the Muse herself can tell of Goddes love; which cometh to the child from the Mother's embrace, an Idea spacious as the starry firmament's inescapable infinity of radiant gaze, that fadeth only as it outpasseth mortal sight: and this direct contact is't with eternities, this springtide miracle of the soul's nativity that oft hath set philosophers adrift in dream; which thing Christ taught, when he set up a little child to teach his first Apostles and to accuse their pride, saying, Unless ye shall receive it as a child, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. So thru' out all his young mental apprenticehood the child of very simplicity, and in the grace and beauteous attitude of infantine wonder, is apt to absorb Ideas in primal purity, and by the assimilation of thatt immortal food may build immortal life; but ever with the growth of understanding, as the sensible images are more and more corrupt, troubled by questioning thought, or with vainglory alloy'd, 'tis like enough the boy in prospect of his manhood wil hav cast to th'winds his Baptism with his Babyhood; nor might he escape the fall of Ev'ryman, did not a second call of nature's Love await him to confirm his Faith or to revoke him if he is wholly lapsed therefrom. And so mighty is this second vision, which cometh in puberty of body and adolescence of mind that, forgetting his Mother, he calleth it “first Love”; for it mocketh at suasion or stubbornness of heart, as the oceantide of the omnipotent Pleasur of God, flushing all avenues of life, and unawares by thousandfold approach forestalling its full flood with divination of the secret contacts of Love,— of faintest ecstacies aslumber in Nature's calm, like thought in a closed book, where some poet long since sang his throbbing passion to immortal sleep—with coy tendernesses delicat as the shifting hues that sanctify the silent dawn with wonder-gleams, whose evanescence is the seal of their glory, consumed in self-becoming of eternity; till every moment as it flyeth, cryeth “Seize! Seize me ere I die! I am the Life of Life.” 'Tis thus by near approach to an eternal presence man's heart with divine furor kindled and possess'd falleth in blind surrender; and finding therewithal in fullest devotion the full reconcilement betwixt his animal and spiritual desires, such welcome hour of bliss standeth for certain pledge of happiness perdurable: and coud he sustain this great enthusiasm, then the unbounded promise would keep fulfilment; since the marriage of true minds is thatt once fabled garden, amidst of which was set the single Tree that bore such med'cinable fruit that if man ate thereof he should liv for ever. Friendship is in loving rather than in being lov'd, which is its mutual benediction and recompense; and tho' this be, and tho' love is from lovers learn'd, it springeth none the less from the old essence of self. No friendless man ('twas well said) can be truly himself; what a man looketh for in his friend and findeth, and loving self best, loveth better than himself, is his own better self, his live lovable idea, flowering by expansion in the loves of his life. And in the nobility of our earthly friendships we hav all grades of attainment, and the best may claim perfection of kind; and so, since ther be many bonds other than breed (friendships of lesser motiv, found even in the brutes) and since our politick is based on actual association of living men, 'twil come that the spiritual idea of Friendship, the huge vastidity of its essence, is fritter'd away in observation of the usual habits of men; as happ'd with the great moralist, where his book saith that ther can be no friendship betwixt God and man because of their unlimited disparity. From this dilemma of pagan thought, this poison of faith, Man-soul made glad escape in the worship of Christ; for his humanity is God's Personality, and communion with him is the life of the soul. Of which living ideas (when in the struggle of thought harden'd by language they become symbols of faith) Reason builded her maze, wherefrom none should escape, wandering intent to map and learn her tortuous clews, chanting their clerkly creed to the high-echoing stones of their hand-fashion'd temple: but the Wind of heav'n bloweth where it listeth, and Christ yet walketh the earth, and talketh still as with those two disciples once on the road to Emmaus—where they walk and are sad; whose vision of him then was his victory over death, thatt resurrection which all his lovers should share, who in loving him had learn'd the Ethick of happiness; whereby they too should come where he was ascended to reign over men's hearts in the Kingdom of God. Our happiest earthly comradeships hold a foretaste of the feast of salvation and by thatt virtue in them provoke desire beyond them to out-reach and surmount their humanity in some superhumanity and ultimat perfection: which, howe'er 'tis found or strangely imagin'd, answereth to the need of each and pulleth him instinctivly as to a final cause. Thus unto all who hav found their high ideal in Christ, Christ is to them the essence discern'd or undiscern'd of all their human friendships; and each lover of him and of his beauty must be as a bud on the Vine and hav participation in him; for Goddes love is unescapable as nature's environment, which if a man ignore or think to thrust it off he is the ill-natured fool that runneth blindly on death. This Individualism is man's true Socialism. This is the rife Idea whose spiritual beauty multiplieth in communion to transcendant might. This is thatt excelent way whereon if we wil walk all things shall be added unto us—thatt Love which inspired the wayward Visionary in his dóctrinal ode to the three christian Graces, the Church's first hymn and only deathless athanasian creed,—the which “except a man believe he cannot be savèd”. This is the endearing bond whereby Christ's company yet holdeth together on the truth of his promise that he spake of his great pity and trust in man's love, Lo, I am with you always ev'n to the end of the world. Truly the Soul returneth the body's loving where it hath won it . . . and God so loveth the world . . . and in the fellowship of the friendship of Christ God is seen as the very self-essence of love, Creator and mover of all as activ Lover of all, self-express'd in not-self, without which no self were. In thought whereof is neither beginning nor end nor space nor time; nor any fault nor gap therein 'twixt self and not-self, mind and body, mother and child, 'twixt lover and loved, God and man: but one eternal in the love of Beauty and in the selfhood of Love.
