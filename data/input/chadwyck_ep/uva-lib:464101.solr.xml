      <field name="fulltext">Stultissimum credo ad imitandum non optima quæ? proponere. Plin. Secund. lib. 1. Epist. 5. Not to imitate the best example is the greatest folly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Dedication. Lord, my first fruits should have been sent to thee, For thou the tree That bare them, onely lentest unto me. But while I had the use, the fruit was mine, Not so divine As that I dare presume to call it thine. Before 'twas ripe, it fell unto the ground: And since I found It bruised in the dirt, nor cleane nor sound; Some I have wip'd and pickt, and bring thee now, Lord, thou know'st how: Gladly I would, but dare it not avow. Such as it is, 'tis here. Pardon the best, Accept the rest: Thy pardon and acceptance maketh blest. Subterliminare. A stepping-stone to the threshold of M? Herberts Church-porch. What Church is this? Christs Church. Who builds it? M?. George Herbert. Who assisted it? Many assisted: who, I may not say, So much contention might arise that way. If I say Grace gave all, Wit straight doth thwart, And sayes all that is there is mine: but Art Denies and sayes ther's nothing there but's mine: Nor can I easily the right define. Divide: say, Grace the matter gave, and Wit Did polish it, Art measured and made fit Each severall piece, and fram'd it all together. No, by no means: this may not please them neither. None's well contented with a part alone, When each doth challenge all to be his owne: The matter, the expressions, and the measures, Are equally Arts, Wits, and Graces treasures. Then he that would impartially discusse This doubtfull question, must answer thus: In building of this temple M?. Herbert Is equally all Grace, all Wit, all Art. Roman and Grecian Muses all give way: One English Poem darkens all your day. The Church-yard. Thou that intendest to the Church to day, Come take a turn or two, before thou go'st, In the Church-yard: the walk is in the way. Who takes best heede in going, hasteth most: But he that unprepared rashly ventures, Hastens perhaps to seale his deaths Indentures. The Church-stile. Seest thou that stile? observe then how it rises Step after step, and equally descends: Such is the way to winne celestiall prizes; Humility the course begins and ends. Would'st thou in grace to high perfection grow? Shoot thy roots deep, ground thy foundations low. Humble thy selfe, and God will lift thee up; Those that exalt themselves, he casteth down: The hungry he invites with him to sup, And cloaths the naked with his robe and Crown. Think not thou hast what thou from him would'st have; His labour's lost, if thou thy self canst save. Pride is the prodigalitie of grace, Which casteth all away by griping all: Humilitie is thrift, both keeps its place, And gaines by giving, rises by its fall. To get by giving, and to loose by keeping, Is to be sad in mirth, and glad in weeping. The Church-gate. Next to the stlie, see where the gate doth stand, Which turning upon hooks and hinges may Easily be shut or open'd with one hand, Yet constant in its center still doth stay; And fetching a wide compasse round about, Keeps the same course and distance, never out. Such must the course be that to Heaven tends: He that the gates of righteousnesse would enter, Must still continue constant to his ends, And fix himselfe in God as in his center. Cleave close to him by faith, then move which way Discretion leads thee, and thou shalt not stray. We never wander, till we loose our hold Of bim that is our way, our light, our guide: But when we grow of our own strength too bold, Vnhookt from him, we quickly turn aside. He holds us up, whilest in him we are found: If once we fall from him, we goe to ground. The Church-wals. Now view the Wals, the Church is compast round, As much for safety as for ornament: 'Tis an inclosure, and no common ground; 'Tis Gods freehold, and but our tenement. Tenants at will, and yet in taile we be: Our children have the same right to't as we. Remember there must be no glatts lest ope, Where God hath fenc'd for feare of false illusions: God will have all or none; allows no scope For sinnes incroachments, and mens own intrusions. Close binding locks his laws together fast: He that plucks out the first, puls down the last. Either resolve for all, or else for none; Obedience universall he doth claime: Either be wholly his, or all thine owne. At what thou canst not reach, at least take aime. He that of purpose looks beside the marke, Might as well hoodwinkt shoot, or in the darke. The Church. Lastly consider where the Church doth stand; As neer unto the middle as may be: God in his service chiefely doth command Above all other things sinceritie. Lines drawn from side to side within a round, Not meeting in the Center, short are found. Religion must not side with any thing That swerves from God, or else withdraws from him: He that a welcome sacrifice would bring, Must fetch it from the bottome, not the brim. A sacred Temple of the Holy Ghost Each part of man must be, but his heart most. Hypocrisie in Church is Alchymie, That casts a golden tincture upon brasse: There is no essence in it; 'tis a lye, Though fairely stampt for truth it often passe: Onely the Spirits aqua regia doth Discover it to be but painted froth. The Church-porch. Now ere thou passest further, sit thee down In the Church-porch, &amp; think what thou hast seen; Let due consideration either crown, Or crush thy former purposes. Between Rash undertakings and firme resolutions, Depends the strength or weaknesse of conclusions. Trace thy steps backward in thy memory, And first resolve of that thou heardest last: Sinceritie. It blots the historie Of all religious actions, and doth blast The comfort of them, when in them God sees Nothing but outsides of formalities. In earnest be religious, trifle not; And rather for Gods sake then for thine own: Thou hast rob'd him, unlesse that he have got By giving, if his glory be not grown Together with thy good. Who seeketh more Himself then God, would make his roofe his floore. Next to sinceritie remember still, Thou must resolve upon Integritie: God will have all thou hast; thy minde, thy will, Thy thoughts, thy words, thy works. A nullitie, It proves, when God, that should have all, doth finde That there is any one thing left behinde. And having given him all, thou must receive All that he gives. Meete his commandement, Resolve that thine obedience must not leave Vntill it reach unto the fame extent: For all his precepts are of equall strength, And measure thy performance to the length. Then call to minde that Constancy must knit Thine undertakings and thine actions fast: He that sets forth towards Heaven, and doth sit Down by the way, will be found short at last. Be constant to the end, and thou shalt have An heavenly garland, though an earthly grave. But he that would be constant, must not take Religion up by fits and starts alone; But his continuall practise must it make: His course must be from end to end but one. Bones often broken and knit up againe, Loose of their length, though in their strength they gaine. Lastly, remember that Humilitie Must solidate and keep all close together. What pride puffes up with vaine futilitie, Lyes open and expos'd to all ill weather. An empty bubble may faire colours carry; But blow upon it, and it will not tarry. Prize not thine own too high, nor under-rate Anothers worth, but deale indifferently; View the defects of thy spirituall state, And others graces with impartiall eye: The more thou deemest of thy selfe, the lesse Esteeme of thee will all men else expresse. Contract thy lesson now, and this is just The summe of all. He that desires to see The face of God, in his religion must Sincere, entire, constant, and humble be. If thus resolved, feare not to proceed; Else the more haste thou mak'st, the worse thou'lt speed. Invitation. Tvrn in, my Lord, turn in to mee: My heart's an homely place; But thou canst make corruption flee, And fill it with thy grace. So furnished, it will be brave; And a rich dwelling thou shalt have. It was thy lodging once before; It builded was by thee: But I to sinne set ope the doore, It rendred was by mee; And so thy building once defac'd, And in thy roome another plac'd. But he usurps, the right is thine: Oh dispossesse him, Lord. Doe thou but say, this heart is mine, He's gone at the first word. Thy word's thy will, thy will's thy power, Thy time is alwaies; now's mine hower. Now say to sinne, depart; And, sonne, give me thine heart. Thou; that by saying let it be, didst make it; Canst, if thou wilt, by saying give't me, take it. Comfort in extremitie. Alas! my Lord is going; Oh my woe! It will be mine undoing, If he goe. I'le runne and overtake him: If he stay, I'le cry aloud, and make him Look this way. Oh stay my Lord, my love; 'tis I. Comfort me quickly, or I dye. Cheere up thy drooping spirits; I am here. My all-sufficient merits Shall appeare Before the throne of glory In thy stead; I'le put into thy story, What I did. Lift up thine eyes, sad soule, and see Thy Saviour here. Loe, I am he. Alas! shall I present My sinfulnesse To thee? Thou wilt resent The loathsomnesse. Be not afraid, I'le take Thy sinnes on me; And all my favour make To shine on thee. Lord, what thou'lt have me, thou must make me. As I have made thee, now I take thee. Resolution and assurance. Lord, thou wilt love me. Wilt thou not? Be shrew that not; It was my sinne begot That question first: Yes Lord, thou wilt; Thy bloud was spilt To wash away my guilt. Lord, I will love thee. Shall I not? Be shrew that not. 'Twas deaths accursed plot To put that question. Yes I will, Lord, love thee still In spite of all my ill. Then life and love continue still; We shall and will My Lord and I, untill In his celestiall hill We love our fill When he hath purged all my ill. The Nativitie. Vnfold thy face, unmaske thy ray, Shine forth, bright Sunne, double the day: Let no malignant misty fume, Nor foggy vapour once presume To interpose thy perfect sight This day, which makes us love thy light For ever better that we could That blessed object once behold, Which is both the circumference And center of all excellence: Or rather neither, but a treasure Vnconfined without measure: Whose center and circumference Including all preheminence, Excluding nothing but defect, And infinite in each respect; Is equally both here and there, And now and then, and every where; And alwaies one himselfe the same, A beeing farre above a name. Draw neer then, and freely poure Forth all thy light into that houre Which was crowned with his birth, And made heaven envy earth. Let not his birth-day clouded be, By whom thou shinest, and we see. Vows broken and rewarded. Said I not so, that I would sinne no more? Witnesse my God, I did. Yet Iam runne againe upon the score, My faults cannot be hid. What shall I doe? Make vows and break them still? 'Twill be but labour lost: My good cannot prevaile against mine ill, The businesse will be crost. Oh! say not so; thou canst not tell, what strength Thy God may give thee at the length. Renew thy vowes, and if thou keep the last, Thy God will pardon all that's past. Vow whil'st thou canst; whil'st thou canst vow, tho may'st Perhaps performe it when thou thinkest least. Thy God hath not deny'd thee all, Whilest he permits thee but to call: Call to thy God for grace to keep Thy vowes; and if thou break them, weep. Weep for thy broken vowes, and vow againe: Vowes made with tears cannot bee still in vaine. Then once againe I vow to mend my wayes: Lord say Amen, And thine be all the praise. Confusion. Oh! how my minde is gravel'd! not a thought That I can finde, but's ravel'd all to nought. Short ends of threds, and narrow shreds of lists, Knots snarled ruffes, loose broken tufts of twists, Are my torne meditations ragged clothing; Which wound and woven shape a suit for nothing. One while I think, and then I am in paine To think how to unthink that thought againe. How can my soule but famish with this food? Pleasures full bowle tastes rammish, taints the blood: Profit picks bones, and chewes on stones that choak: Honour climbes hils; fats not, but fils with smoak. And whilst my thoughts are greedy upon these, They passe by pearles, and stoop to pick up pease. Such wash and draffe is fit for none but swine; And such I am not, Lord, if I am thine, Cloth me anew, and feed me then afresh: Else my soule dyes famisht and starv'd with flesh. A Paradox. The worse the better. Welcome my health: this sicknesse makes me well. Medicines adiew: When with diseases I have list to dwell, I'll wish for you. Welcome my strength: this weakenesse makes me able Powers adiew: When I am weary grown of standing stable, I'le wish for you. Welcome my wealth: this losse hath gain'd me more Riches adiew: When I again grow greedy to be poore, I'le wish for you. Welcome my credit: this disgrace is glory. Honours adiew: When for renown and fame I shall be sorry, I'le wish for you. Welcome content: this sorrow is my joy. Pleasures adiew: When I desire such griefes as may annoy, I'le wish for you. Health, strength, and riches, credit and content, Are spared best sometimes, when they are spent; Sicknesse and weaknesse, losse, disgrace and sorrow, Lend most sometimes, when they seeme most to borrow: Blest be that hand that helps by hurting, gives By taking, by forsaking me relieves. If in my fall my rising be thy will; Lord, I will say, the worse the better still. I'le speak the Paradox, maintaine thou it; And let thy grace supply my want of wit. Leave me no learning that a man may see, So I may be a scholar unto thee. Inmates. A house I had (a heart I mean) so wide And full of spatious roomes on every side, That viewing it I thought I might doe well (Rather then keep it voide and make no gaine Of what I could not use) to entertaine Such guests as came. I did. But what befell Me quickly in that course, I sigh to tell. A guest I had (alas! I have her still) A great big bellyed guest, enough to fill The vast content of hell, Corruption: By entertaining her, I lost my right To more then all the world hath now in sight; Each day, each houre almost she brought forth one, Or other base begot, Transgression. The charge grew great. I, that had lost before, All that I had, was forced now to score, For all the charges of their maintenance, In doomes-day book: who ever knew't would say, The least summe there was more then I could pay, When first 'twas due; beside continuance, Which could not choose but much the debt enhance. To ease me, first I wisht her to remove; But she would not. I sued her then above, And begg'd the Court of heaven, but in vaine, To cast her out. No, I could not evade The bargaine, which she pleaded I had made; That whilest both lived, I should entertaine At mine own charge both her and all her traine. No helpe then, but or I must die or she; And yet my death of no availe would be: For one death I had died already then, When first she liv'd in me; and now to die Another death againe, were but to tye And twist them both into a third; which, when It once hath seized on, never looseth men. Her death might be my life; but her to kill I of my selfe had neither power, nor will. So desperate was my case. Whil'st I delayd, My guest still teem'd, my debts still greater grew; The lesse I had to pay, the more was due: The more I knew, the more I was affraid; The more I mus'd, the more I was dismaid. At last I learnt, there was no way but one, A friend must doe it for me. He alone, That is the Lord of life, by dying can Save men from death, and kill Corruption: And many yeers agoe the deed was done; His heart was pierc'd, out of his side there ran Sinnes corrasives, restoratives for man. This precious balme I begg'd, for pities sake, At Mercies gate: where Faith alone may take, What Grace and Truth doe offer liberally. Bountie said, Come. I heard it, and beleeved None ever there complain'd but was relieved. Hope waiting upon Faith, said instantly, That henceforth I should live, Corruption dye. And so she dy'd, I live. But yet, alas! We are not parted. She is where she was; Cleaves fast unto me, still looks through mine eies Speaks in my tongue, and muses in my minde, Works with my hands: her body's left behinde, Although her soule be gone. My miseries All flow from hence; from hence my woes arise. I loath my selfe, because I leave her not; Yet cannot leave her. No, she is my lot Now being dead, that living was my choice; And still though dead, she both conceives and beares Many faults daily, and as many feares: All which for vengeance call with a loud voice, And drown my comforts with their deadly noise. Dead bodies kept unburied quickly stink, And putrifie: how can I then but think Corruption noysome, even mortify'd? Though such she were before, yet such to me She seemed not: Kind fooles can never see, Or will not credit, untill they have try'd, That friendly lookes oft false intents doe hide. But mortified Corruption lyes unmaskt, Blabs her own secret filthynesse unaskt, To all that understand her. That doe none, In whom she lives embraced with delight: She first of all deprives them of their sight; Then dote they on her as upon their owne, And she to them seems beautifull alone. But woe is me! one part of me is dead, The other lives. Yet that which lives, is led, Or rather carry'd captive unto sinne, By the dead part. I am a living grave, And a dead body I within me have. The worse part of the better oft doth win; And when I should have ended, I begin. The sent would choak me, were it not that grace Sometimes vouchsafeth to perfume the place With odors of the spirit, which doe ease me, And counterpoise Corruption. Blessed spirit, Although eternall torments be my merit, And of my self Transgressions onely please me, Adde grace enough being reviv'd to raise me. Challenge thine own: Let not intruders hold Against thy right, what to my wrong I sold. Having no state my selfe but tenancy, And tenancy at will, what could I grant That is not voided, if thou say avaunt? O speak the word, and make these inmates flee; Or which is one, take me to dwell with thee. The Curbe. Peace rebell Thought: do'st thou not know thy King, My God is here? Cannot his presence, if no other thing, Make thee forbeare? Or were he absent, all the standers by Are but his spyes: And well he knows, if thou should'st it deny, Thy words were lyes. If others will not, yet I must, and will My selfe complaine. My God, even now a base rebellious thought Began to move, And subt'ly twining with me would have wrought Me from thy love: Faine he would have me to believe, that sinne And thou might both Take up my heart together for your Inne, And neither loth The others company; a while sit still, And part againe. Tell me, my God, how this may be redrest: The fault is great, And I the guilty party have confest, I must be beat: And I refuse not punishment for this, Though to my paine, So I may learne to doe no more amisse, Nor sinne againe. Correct me, if thou wilt; but teach me then, What I shall doe. Lord of my life, me thinks I heare thee say, That labour's eas'd: The fault that is confest, is done away; And thou art pleas'd. How can I sinne againe, and wrong thee then That do'st relent, And cease thine anger straight, as soon as men Doe but repent? No rebell Thought: for if thou move againe, I'le tell thee too. The Losse. The match is made between my love and me: And therefore glad and merry now I'le be. Come Glorie, crowne my head, and pleasures drowne my bed of thornes in downe. Sorrow be gone, delight and joy alone befit my honey moone. Be packing now you comb'rous Cares and Feares: Mirth will allow no roome to sighs and teares. Whilst thus I lay as ravisht with delight, I heard one say, so fooles their friends requite. I knew the voyce, my Lords; and at the noise his words did make, arose. I lookt and spied each where, and lowdly cry'd, my deare; but none reply'd. Then to my griefe I found my love was gone, Without reliefe, leaving me all alone. The Search. Whither, oh! whither is my Lord departed? What can my Love, that is so tender hearted, Forsake the soule which once he thorow darted, As though it never smarted? No sure, my Love is here, if I could finde him: He that fils all can leave no place behinde him. But oh! my sences are too weak to winde him, Or else I doe not minde him. Oh! no, I mind him not so as I ought; Nor seek him so as I by him was sought, When I had lost my selfe; he dearely bought Me that was sould for nought. But I have wounded him, that made me sound; Lost him againe, by whom I first was found; Him, that exalted me, have cast to th'ground: My sinnes his bloud have drown'd. Tell me, oh! tell me (thou alone canst tell) Lord of my life, where thou art gone to dwell: For in thy absence heaven it selfe is hell; Without thee none is well. Or if thou beest not gone, but onely hidest Thy presence in the place where thou abidest; Teach me the sacred art, which thou providest For all them whom thou guidest, To seek and finde thee by: Else here I'le lye, Vntill thou finde me. If thou let me dye That onely unto thee for life doe cry, Thou dyest as well as I. For if thou live in me, and I in thee, Then either both alive or dead must be: At least, I'le lay my death on thee, and see If thou wilt not agree. For though thou be the judge thy selfe, I have Thy promise for it which thou canst not wave, That who salvation at thy hands doe crave, Thou wilt not faile to save. Oh! seek and finde me then, or else deny Thy truth, thy selfe. Oh! thou that canst not lye Shew thy selfe constant to thy word, draw nigh; Finde me. Loe, here I lye. The Returne. Loe, now my love appeares, My teares Have clear'd mine eyes. I see 'Tis he. Thanks blessed Lord, thine absence was my hell; And now thou art returned, I am well. By this I see I must Not trust My joyes unto my selfe: This shelfe Of too secure and presumptuous pleasure Had almost sunke my ship, and drown'd my treasure. Who would have thought a joy So coy, To be offended so And go So suddenly away? as though enjoying Full pleasure and contentment were annoying. Hereafter I had need Take heed: Joyes, amongst other things, Have wings, And watch their opportunities of flight; Converting in a moment day to night. But is't enough for me, To be Instructed to be wise? I'le rise, And reade a lecture unto them that are Willing to learn, how comfort dwels with care. He that his joyes would keepe, Must weepe, And in the brine of teares And feares Must pickle them. That powder will preserve: Faith with repentance is the soules conserve. Learne to make much of care: A rare And precious balsome 'tis For blisse; Which oft resides where mirth with sorrow meets. Heavenly joyes on earth are bitter-sweets. The Circumcision. Soorrow betide my sinnes! Must smart so soon Seaze on my Saviours tender flesh, scarce grown Vnto an eight dayes age? Can nothing else asswage The wrath of heaven but his infant blood? Innocent infant, infinitely good! Is this thy welcome to the world, great God: No sooner born but subject to the rod, Of sinne incensed wrath? Alas! what pleasure hath Thy Fathers justice to begin thy passion Almost together with thine incarnation? Is it to antidate thy death? Indite Thy condemnation himselfe? and write The coppie with thy bloud, Since nothing is so good? Or is't by this experiment to try, Whether thou beest borne mortall and canst dye? If man must needs draw blood of God, yet why Stayes he not till thy time be come to die? Didst thou thus early bleed For us, to shew what need We have to hasten unto thee as fast, And learne that all the time is lost that's past? 'Tis true we should doe so. Yet in this blood Ther's something else that must be understood: It seales thy covenant; That so we may not want Witnesse enough against thee, that thou art Made subject to the law to act our part. The Sacrament of thy regeneration It cannot be. It gives no intimation Of what thou wert, but we. Native impuritie, Originall corruption, was not thine; But onely as thy righteousnesse is mine. In holy Baptisme this is brought to mee, As that in Circumcision was to thee: And so thy losse and paine Did prove my joy and gaine. Thy Circumcision writ thy death in blood: Baptisme in water seales my livelyhood. Oh blessed change! yet rightly understood That blood was water, and this water's blood. What shall I give againe To recompence thy paine? Lord, take revenge upon me for this smart: To quit thy fore-skin, circumcise my heart. Inundations. We talke of Noahs flood as of a wonder; And so we may. The Scriptures say, The waters did prevaile. the hils were under, And nothing could be seen but sea. And yet there are two other floods surpasse That flood as farre, As heaven one starre: Which many men regard as little as The ordinariest things that are. The one is sinne, the other is salvation: And we must need Confesse indeed That either of them is an inundation, That doth the deluge farre exceed. In Noahs flood he and his houshold liv'd; And there abode A whole Ark-load Of other creatures, that were then repriev'd, All safely on the waters rode. But when sinne came, it overflowed all, And left none free: Nay, even he That knew no sinne, could not release my thrall; But that he was made sinne for me. And when salvation came, my Saviours blood Drown'd sinne againe With all its traine Of evils; overflowing them with good, With good that ever shall remaine. Oh! let there be one other inundation: Let grace overflow In my soule so, That thankfulnesse may levell with salvation, And sorrow sinne may overgrow. Then will I praise my Lord and Saviour so, That Angels shall Admire mans fall; When they shall see Gods greatest glory grow, Where Satan thought to root out all. Sinne. Sinne, I would faine define thee, but thou art An uncouth thing, All that I bring To shew thee fully, shews thee but in part. I call thee the transgression of the law. And yet I read, That sinne is dead Without the law; and thence it strength doth draw. I say thou art the fling of death. 'Tis true. And yet I finde Death comes behinde: The work is done before the pay be due. I say thou art the devils work. Yet hee Should much rather Call thee father: For he had been no devill but for thee. What shall I call thee then? If death and devill, Right understood, Be names too good; I'le say thou art the quintessence of evill. Travels at home. Oft have I wisht a traveller to be; Mine eyes did even itch the sights to see, That I had heard and read of. Oft I have Been greedy of occasion, as the grave That never sayes enough; yet still was crost When oportunities had promis'd most. At last I said: What meanst thou wandring else To straggle thus? Goe travell first thy selfe: Thy little world can shew thee wonders great; The greater may have more, but not more neat And curious pieces. Search, and thou shalt finde Enough to talk of. If thou wilt, thy minde Europe supplies, and Asia thy will, And Africk thine affections. And if still Thou list to travell further, put thy sences For both the Indies. Make no more pretences Of new discoveries, whilst yet thine own And neerest little world is still unknown. Away then with thy quadrants, compasses, Globes, tables, cards, and mappes, and minute glasses: Lay by thy journals and thy diaries, Close up thine annalls and thy histories: Studie thy selfe, and reade what thou hast writ In thine own book, thy conscience: Is it fit To labour after other knowledge so, And thine own neerest, dearest selfe not know? Travels abroad both deare and dangerous are, Whil'st oft the soule payes for the bodies fare: Travels at home are cheape and safe. Salvation Comes mounted on the wings of meditation, He that doth live at home, and learns to know God and himselfe, needeth no further goe. FINIS.</field>
