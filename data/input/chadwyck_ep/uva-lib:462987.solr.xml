      <field name="fulltext">The Recreations of his Age Of the kindes and frutes of good and yll. Knowen good devyded into three, Profytt, delighte, and honestye; And yll alsoe hathe three of name, Whiche all menn call, losse, payne, and shame, Whosoe the good by payne achyves, The payne passethe, the good revyves: Whosoe the yll by pleasure attaynes, The pleasure fades, the shame remaynes: Thus payne for good bringethe longe fame, Pleasure for yll bringethe longe shame. Agaynste Luste. To man lewde luste bringethe theis ylles, Councell it damnes, his mynde it kylles, Vertue it voydes, manners it marres, Vice it nursethe, his strengthe it starues, His wytte it dulles, and with sorrowe endes, A number of naughtes to manne it sendes. Of Fortune and wisdome. As ffortune good vayne pleasure breedes, Soe pleasure fonde to follye leades: ffor fortune blindes soe wisdomes state, That fewe be wise and fortunate: Therefore when fortune fawnethe moste, Lett reason then rule the hole roste: fflyeinge this fonde foolisshe devise, Better happye then to be wise. Of talke and felloweshippe. As tree by frute and goulde by fyer, Soe shewed by talke is hartes desyer: Thye nature aye is knowen alsoe By choyse of mates resorters to: For as thye talke and fellowes be, Soe thee inclined all menne maye se: Yea filthye talke and fellowes lewde Make the wise fooles and the good shrewde: And fellowes good and honeste speche To make naughte good is the beste Leeche. Amonge the thornes and thistelles thycke Harde to goe soe, but some will pricke: Therfore if thowe loueste honestee, By vse of theis, lett menn it see. Perilles followeinge fortune by Enuye and Malice. Like as the tree of frute moste puer To save from spoyle requires moste cuer, And as the grape of sweteste taste The Waspe and bee dothe cheifelye waste, Even soe the man that hathe greate store Of fortunes giftes muste thinke therefore. Like store of menn there lyes in wayte Of waspye kinde seekeinge suche bayte: And thoughe that wealthe can malice fence, Envye thereof takethe his Essence: ffor slye envye hathe moste delighte On the happye to spighte his spighte. Theis vices twooe are tormentours That poore and riche vexethe at all howers: The envyous freates beinge neglecte And malice threat by wealthe deiecte. Therefore councell woulde I my brother To save for thone and dispise thother. Agaynste Idlenes. What bringethe ruste to Iron smothe? Whye stynkethe water that dothe not moue? Whye dothe the grounde that fertell was Bare thorne and thistell in stede of grasse? What bredethe mothe, what bredethe moulde And thousandes like here lefte vntoulde? Noe cause but this when all is soughte, Neglecte throughe slothe thinges lye vnwroughte. Likewise of man bothe bodye and mynde By noe one thinge suche hurte dothe fynde As they doe by slowe Idlenes, Of all lewde vice the cheife foundres. Noe canker can Iron eate soe sore But Idlenes healthe hurtes muche more: Nor noe grownde growe soe wylde for tylthe As mannes mynde rude by Idle fylthe. The mothe the moulde in manners growe By suche shrewed seedes as it dothe sowe. The mynde well wroughte still forthe dothe bringe Some vertuous frute as his ofspringe. The Idle mynde whiche fleshe and luste Beinge vnwroughte nedes followe muste His fleshelye frute muste nedes oute blowe: Suche Carpenter suche chippes you knowe. A witte whiche earste quicke and sharpe was Throughe Idlenes is dulle as Asse, And memorye not exercised Growes slipperye, this is ofte tryed. The Idle mann is soe tender That strenghte thereby is full slender. Besides to mann it dothe forthe bringe Ill yrkesomenes moste lothesome thinge. Thus mynde and witte delighte and strenghte By Idlenes be loste at lenghte. In commendacion of the meane estate. The suereste state and beste degree Is to possesse mediocritye. By proofe we finde in everye storme The hier tree the sorer torne: The Seas rageinge with surges hye When the meane fludes reste quietlye. Agayne we see the thorne and shrubbe As thinges vyle all menn vppe stubbe: And where the brookes be over smale Menn stoppe them vppe, and therewithall The loweste hedge menn moste downe treade, The weake to wall ioynes in eche stede. Eschewe to creepe, seeke not to flye, To lowe for the Crowe, to hye for the Pye, Bene twooe extremes, and extremes all ffrom vertues bowndes to vyce doe fall. fflye them therefore as poyson stronge And singe the meane as moste swete songe. The mightie man the greate estate With thousande cares cumbers his pate, Whiche the wise man of meane degree ffor his estate nede not foresee: ffor their excesse makethe of vayne Ofte nedefull thinges pompe to maynetayne. And madde he is that makethe nede Of not nedefull vayne pompe to fede. ffor those vayne nedes are nedefullye To be foresene as necessarye, Wherewith his brayne he ofte perplexethe When the meane man noe suche thinge vexethe. His meate his slepe his other reste, Care dothe cumber his daylye geste: And what rewarde for this agayne But cappe and knee of Selye menne? Whiche whoe soe geves or else dothe take Of gayne or losse noe compte can make. But nowe one telles me in myne eare That this gaye man hathe muche gaye geare: Plentye he hathe of menn and horse And dayntye meates to franke his Cors, Venus at will beddes of delighte Preste all to sarve his appetyte, And appetyte still to contente Is merieste lyfe that can be spente. This tale and lyfe tendes all to one, Apparance muche Existence none. ffor he that setts ffelicitye In appetytes Satietye Withoute makeinge distinction When it is rulde by Reason And when onelye by luste and will Suche appetyte for to fullfille Hathe righte greate nede of the rable, The monster is soe variable. But where reason rulethe the roste She is full served with muche lesse coste And muche lesse care as you shall see In poyntes moste dere to eache degree. Good meate and drinke the meane state hase Inoughe to keepe healthe in good case. The mightie hathe suche dayntye store Phisicke muste heale ofte natures sore. The meane is cladde from hurte of ayer, The mightie is madde that his clothes fayer Be marde with mothes and loste with lyei nge, When the faulte is in his muche byeinge. As to the rowte of Sarveinge menne Of ffortye they vse well scante tenne: The reste doe naughte that greate men takes, But eate and drinke and fill the Jakes. A breede of theves for to saye trothe, A nurce of Idlenes and slothe. The meane mans menn snarre grudge or snufe, Doe all their thinges with spede to profe: And fewe well wroughte knoweinge to doe Will sarve them selves and mayster toe. Sounde slepe alsoe withoute dreameinge ffor natures ease to man dothe bringe Not surfettes chere but the meane dyett, Nor beddes softe but the bedde quyett. Venus delighte and tickelinge Luste By choyse and change nedes followe muste Their wanton lyfe and greate excesse: But what is that but bestelynes? The Cowe the Sowe the Bull the Bore Have for like luste like choyse like store. But natures dve whiche it dothe crave Of Venus rightes the man maye have: And to excede natures desyer Is to seeke heate where nedes noe fyer. Thus you see their pompe and pryde Standes by excesse from reason wyde: Whose countrye state is povertye Dwellinge throwe wante in miserye: Whiche to disswade I iudge but vayne, Menn flyeinge it as deadelye payne. Wherefore by righte I maye conclude Of thre estates twooe are escheude, As twooe extremes by reasons lore, And the meane state is sett before, Whoe bringes and bredes theis Juells three, Saftye, Quiette and Libertye. Agaynste a mynde not contented. Nothinge in earthe soe good I fynde As in a mann a contented mynde. Fewe thinges with this doe sarue alone, And without this all sarues as none. This breedes and makes in euerye state Longe life to haue mirthe for his mate: And wante of this makes carke and care Shrewed lyfe and shorte thorowe his ioyes rare. Agaynste Ambityon. Whie woulde the Knighte a Barron bee? Whie woulde the Barron an Earles degree? Whie woulde the Earle a Duke become? Whie woulde the Duke a Kinges rome? And yet a Kinge not soe contente But seekes increase of govermente. ffor hardde it is a Kinge to fynde That with one Realme contentes his mynde. And yet more hardd the truthe to tell To fynde one that one governes well. Nowe in this tumblinge tosseinge state There is smale reste I am suer of that, And saftye none but daunger muche. Nowe museinge what shoulde soe moue suche Noe cause of this can I invente But by desire mynde discontente. Agaynste Couetousnes. What is the cause the gredye manne With care to gett waxethe pale and wanne? Haueinge enoughe whye craues he more? Whye dothe desier growe with his store? A like disease to my thinkeinge As where thirste growes by muche drinkeinge. Whye makes he wante where plentye is And haueinge thinges their vse doe misse? Hee seekes with payne and keepes with care, Hee hordes and hydes and makethe rare. Thinges of that kynde shoulde common bee, Changeinge nature in hur degree. And yet by profe he sees at eye Thinges gotten thus spente willfullye. Noe cause of this can I inuente But thorowe desyre mynde discontente. Agaynste Luste. Whie dothe the man that hathe a wyfe Loueinge and fayer and chaste of lyfe Loue an other, withoute suche cause That settes by him not twooe good strawes? Whie dothe the Queyne and common drabbe Whiche bringethe shame losse payne and scabbe Delighte thee more then a wyfe good Whiche bringes the impes of thine owne blode? This breedes a frende, she breedes a foe, This bringes to thee, she pluckes thee froe, This sicke and hole seekes thee to please, Thother never but for hur ease. Wherefore agaynste reason and righte Done suche as soe sett their delighte. Noe cause of this can I invente But by lewde luste mynde discontente. Agaynste Inconstancye. The marchantes wishe the Lawyers trayne For hasarde smale and certeine gayne. The Lawyer dulled with sute and strife Wisshethe to lyue the marchantes lyfe: The Countrye mann in towne woulde dwelle To haue all thinges prouyded well. The countrye healthe for stinkeinge streete To chaunge the townesmenne thinkethe meete. To marrye the mayde thinkethe longe, But the wyfe singes an other songe. Thoman to rule a man woulde bee, The man for ease wisshethe hur degree. Eache age and state wisshethe a change Vnknowen for knowen, the whiche is strange. Noe cause of this can I inuente But mynde vnstayed still discontente. The conclusion. To ende I iudge pleasure but scante Where eache others case dothe wishe and wante. ffor pleasante lyfe there fyndes smale grace Where wishe and wante takethe suche place. Whiche eache man maye easelye eschewe Geueinge nature noe more then due, Whoe with fewe thinges is well contente By witte in mirthe pleasantelye spente. Thus by playne profe it dothe appere That thinges of all moste wisshed for here, Honor I meane wealthe nor bewtye Nor state of lyfe nor noe degree Can geve a man a pleasante lyfe, His mynde for more seekeinge with stryfe. ffor suche seekeinge puttethe to flyghte Solace and mirthe mannes cheife delighte. Agayne some menne we daylye see Of everye sorte state and degree Of thinges wisshed for haveinge smale store, Liueinge contente seekinge noe more, Prolongeinge their dayes with mirthe and ioye, Noe Lorde the lyke CÃ¦sar nor Roye. Wherefore for man nothinge I fynde Soe good as a contented mynde. Of hope feare and perswacion. To hope the beste or feare the worste Whiche is better harde to iudge iuste: For hopeinge good and happeninge soe Longe looked for ioye releuethe smale woe: And hopeinge good happeninge mischeife Suche happe besides hope increasethe greife: Feareinge the worste is it soe chaunce, Then greife is growen by feares continuaunce, Feareinge the worste happeninge the beste, Tyll that happe happed feare bredde smalle reste. Synce hope and feare inquyettes thye harte Vse thou therefore the contrarye parte. Perswade the worste in thinges to come As beste releife in myne opinyon: Perswadeinge the worste chaunceinge not soe: Then sodenn ioye redublethe greate woe: Perswadeinge the worste if the worste come, Yet payne is paste by that perswacyon. To conclude therefore he silde repentes That perswades the worste in all euentes. The strengthe of Education. If the false ffoxe geese and the gredye woolfe sheepe By payne in bringeinge vppe maye be taughte to keepe, What excuse for thee then if thye childe lacke nurture Synce thou seeste Education chaungethe nature? Agaynste occasion of Euell. As causer of the smoke is the kindeler of the fyer, Euen soe is wanton talke the cause of yll desyer: And as in this soe in the reste if thou wilte fle yll, Fle then all occasion that belongethe thereuntyll. An Ode of Horace turned at the desier of my Ladye his Lo: wyfe. The righteste course in lyfe to keepe Is not to presse alwayes to runne With sayles vppe hoyste in the mayne deepe, Nor yet for feare the storme shoulde come The crooked shore to nere to creepe. The golden meane whosoe loues well Shall safe and free thereby eschewe The lothesome howse with filthe and smelle And envious spighte the which is due To suche as in the Pallace dwell. The greate proude Pyne eache wynde dothe shake, The loftier tower mounted on hye The greater falle on grounde dothe make: The Lighteninge brime fallen from the Skye The mountaynes huge with flames dothe take. A mynde well taughte standes suer and faste, When fortune frownes hopeinge of better: And when she smiles it makes noe haste, Knoweinge that Jove oft with his Septer Brynges and removes the winters blaste. Althoughe nowe ill not ever be With lowringe looke and with bowe bente, Thoughe Phebus nowe dothe threate greate woe, Or it be longe with harpe full Jente His mirthe shall force all feare thee froe. In stormye tymes have courage stoute, And in forewyndes sayleinge at will Gather in thye sayles with wynde puffed oute, And thus thou shalte throwe rede and will Rvnne the righte race withoute all doute. The Prologe to the maske of myndes. This worldes madde maskerye I intende to disgrace Pluckeinge of the viser and the disguiseinge gere From this merye maskers soe as their open face Maye to the beholders euidentelye appeare, Whereby vyce and vertue all naked as it weare Shall singeleye and simpelye be open to thyne eye, Whiche disguiseinge hadd hydd in this madde maskerye. The maskerye of bodyes deuised for delighte Dothe the beholders eye but oute of knoweledge bringe, But this slye maske of myndes wherof I meane to wryte Bothe bleres and blyndes the beholders vnderstandeinge, Whiche breedes blynde error the moste pestilente thinge, For soe shall vice for vertue and vertue for vice Haue the beholders estymacion and pryce. Agayne the maske of bodyes hathe his game place smale, His maskers but fewe, his beholders somewhat moe: But for the maske of myndes the worlde vniuersalle Semes game place smale inowe and with the leaste alsoe The maskers are soe manye, and yet agayne loe The beholders but fewe that vnderstandes theis artes, With suche shrewde slilye wyles they vse to playe their partes. But manye blynde beholders of this maske there bee, Whoe seethe but perceyues not the maskers fyne sectes: Eache masker a beholder, soe maye you ofte see: And all this at one tyme to seuerall respectes Of error and ignorance, suche are the effectes Whiche beinge cleane banisshed oute of eache manns mynde Woulde make eache thinge appeare accordinge to his kynde. This error in decerninge growethe moste of this, That some vice and vertue in semblance are soe nere That the one for the other full ofte taken is, And to this tryme masker the more like the more dere: For hereof he shapes all his disguiseinge gere Soe fynelye soe craftelye that he that takes noe hede Shall quickelye amongeste theis spynne a folishe threde. When the prodigall liberall and the wylye wyse Thippocryte religious and the rashe semes corageous, When couetousnes is colored with frugalityes vyce, When the slothefull quyette and the playne outerageous, When licence for libertye is daylye taken by vs, Is it anye wonder trowe ye thoughe theis maskers excell, When suche madde maskeinge aparell becomes them soe well? Theis thinges well to decerne deuide and discouer, Althoughe it be hardd and will muche prouoke offence, Yet will I it assaye thereby to moue other My wante full to supplye bothe in worke and in sence: Of a maske strayte waye to make is not my pretence, But yet to guide the goer I will doe my beste, And in bonis you knowe voluisse sat est. Qualytyes belongeinge to sundrye persons. Lyberalitye in Nobles, in Lawyers eloquence, Scyence in spirituall menn, in Marchantes credence, Comelynes in womenn, in husbandemenn frugalitye, Thus to eache of theis belonges suche a qualytye. A Carolle.

Agayne ohe Lorde whoe canne compare Thye free geven giftes and those not rare, Provokeinge love eache daye and tyme, With their rewardes of synne and cryme, But with moyste eye and hevye harte Muste nedes repente his sinfull parte? Repentaunce thus grounded of love And hope of faythe dothe me nowe move On knees to fall and mercye crye: Mercye ohe Lorde mercye mercye: ffrom iustice Lorde I doe appeale To thye mercye myne onelye weale.

Defende me Lorde by grace this nighte ffrom all assautes of foe and fende, And thoughe daye lighte doe fayle my sighte Yet lighte of grace fayle not my mynde: And as thou doeste graunte this by kynde, Soe this to aske with voyce and thoughte With cappe and knee I knowe I oughte. Graunte Lorde that as I slepe to wynne Put of my clothes and all the reste, Euen soe my mynde vnclothed of synne Maye reste throughe grace within my breste, Soe as noe dreame maye fyle my neste: And thus to thee I mee betake Bothe when I slepe and when I wake.
