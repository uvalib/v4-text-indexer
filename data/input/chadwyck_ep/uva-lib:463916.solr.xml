      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT VIRTVOVS AND WORTHILY honoured Gentleman Richard Hvbert, Esquire. D. JVNII IVVENALIS Lib. I. Sat. 5. To Trebius. Labouring to bring him in dislike of his continued course of frequenting the Table of Virro, a great Lord of Rome. If of thy purpose yet, thou tak'st no shame, But keep'st thy minde (immutably) the same, That thou esteem'st it as a good in chiefe At others Trenchers to relieue thy life: If those things thou can'st find a backe to beare, That not Sarmentus, nor vile Galba were So base to put in patience of a guest, No, not for Cæsars far-exceeding feast: Feare will affect me to bleeue thy troth In any witnesse, though produc'd by oath. For nothing in my knowledge fals, that is More frugall then the belly: but say this That not enough food all thy meanes can find, To keepe thy gut from emptinesse and wind Is no Creeke void? no Bridge? no peece of shed Halfe, or not halfe? Would thy not being fed At Virro's Table be so foule a shame? Does hunger blow in thee so false a flame? As not to tast it nobler in as poore And vile a place as hath beene nam'd before? To quake for cold, and gnaw the mustiest grounds Of Barly-griest (bak'd purposely for hounds) First, take it for a Rule, that if my Lord Shall once be pleas'd to grace thee with his bord, The whole reuenewes that thy hopes inherit Rising from seruices of ancient merit, Jn this requitall amply paid will prooue. O 'tis the fruit of a transcendent loue, To giue one victuals; That, thy Table-King Layes in thy dish, though nere so thinne a thing, Yet that reproch, still in thine eares shall ring. If therefore after two moneths due neglect He deignes his poore dependant to respect, And lest the third bench faile to fill the ranck, He shall take thee vp to supply the blanck. Let's sit together Trebius (saies my Lord) See all thy wishes sum'd-vp in a word. What canst thou aske at Ioues hand after this? This grace to Trebius, enough ample is; To make him start from sleepe before the Larke, Poasting abroad vntrus'd, and in the darke Perplex'd with feare, lest all the seruile-rout Of his saluters, haue the round run-out Before he come; whiles yet the fixed Starre Shewes his ambiguous head; and heauens cold Car The slow Bootes wheeles about the Beare. And yet for all this, what may be the cheare? To such vile wine, thy throat is made the sinck As greasie woll, would not endure to drink, And we must shortly looke to see our guest Transform'd into a Berecynthian-Priest. Words make the Prologue to prepare the fray, And in the next Scene, Pots are taught to play The parts of weapons: Thy red Napkin now Descends to tell thee of thy broken-Brow: And such euents doe euermore ensue When you poore Guests, and Virro's seruing crue Grow to the heat of such vnciuill Warrs, The vile Wine made the Bellowes to your Iarrs. For Virro's-selfe, the wine he drinks was borne When Consuls (Phæbus-like) appear'd vnshorn, A Grape that long since in the wars was prest By our confederate-Marsians, and the rest Of which, no drop his longing-frend can git Though blowne in fume vp with a Cardiack fit. Next day he likes to taste another field, The Albane hills, or els the Setine yeeld Whose race and rich succession if you aske, Age hath decayd, and sicknesse of the caske, Such Thrasea &amp; Heluidius quaft, stil crownd When Brutus birth, and Cassius they renownd. Virro himselfe in solemn Bowles is seru'd Of Amber, and disparent Beryl keru'd; But to thy trust, no such Cup they commit, Or if they doe, a Spie is fix'd to it To tell the stones; whose firme eye neuer fayles To watch the close walks of thy vulturous nails, Giue leaue (saies Virro) and then takes the Cup, The famous Iasper in it lifting-vp Inglorious prayses: for 'tis now the guize Of him and others to transferre such prize Off from his fingers to his Bowl's; that were Wont to grace swords: &amp; our yong Troian Peere That made Iarbus iealous (since in loue Prefer'd past him by Dido) vs'd t'improue By setting them in fore-front of his sheath; But thy Bowle stands an infinite beneath And beares the Beneuentane-Coblers name, Whose Gallon drunke-off, must thy bloud enflame And is so craz'd, That they would let it passe To them that Matches giue, for broken Glasse; Now, if by fumes of wine, or fiery-meat His Lordships stomacke ouer-boyle with heat, Ther's a cold liquor broght that's made t'outvie The chill impressions of the North-East-skie. J formerly affirm'd, that you and he Were seru'd with wines of a distinct degree, But now remember it belongs to you To keepe your distance in your water too. And (in his Pages place) thy Cups are brought By a swarth foot man, from Getulia bought, Or some steru'd Negro, whose affrightfull sight Thou wouldst abhorre to meet in dead of night Passing the monuments of Latia, In his eye waites the flowre of Asia, A Iewell purchas'd at a higher rate Then Martiall Ancus, or King Tullus State. (Not to stand long) Then all the idle things That grac'd the Courts of all our Roman Kings Jf then thy Bowle his Nectars store shall neede Addresse thee to his Indian Ganymed. Thinke not his page, worth such a world, can skill Or does not scorne, for thred bare Coates to fill, And (to say truth) his forme and prime beside, May well allow him some few Graines of pride. But when does he, to what thou want'st descend? Or thy entreaties, not contemne t'attend? Supply of water craving, hot or cold: No, he (I tell you) in high scorne doth hold To stirre at euery stale dependants call; Or that thou call'st for anything at all, Or sit'st where his forc'd-Stand, his pride depraues; Houses of State abound with stately slaues. And see, another's proud disdaines resist His hand to set thee bread: And yet what is't But hoary cantles of vnbowlted grist? That would a iaw-tooth rowze; and not admit (Though nere so base) thy baser throat a bit: But for his bread, the pride of appetite, Tenderly soft, incomparably white; The first flowre of fine meale, subdu'd in paste, That's a peculiar for my Lords owne taste; See then thou keep'st thy fingers from offence, And giue the Pantler his due reuerence: Or say thou should'st be (malepertly) bold, Seest thou not slaues enough, to force thy hold From thy attempted prize, with taunts like these, Hands off, forward companion, will you please With your familiar Crible to be fed, And vnderstand the colour of your bread? Then grumbles thy disgrace: and is it this For which so oft I haue forborne the blisse Of my faire wife, to poast with earliest speed Vp to Mount Esculine, where agues breede? When my repaire did vernall Iove prouoke, To driue his wether through my winter cloake And in his bitter'st hailes, his murmurs broake? But let vs to our Cates, our course addresse Obserue that Lobster seru'd to Virro's messe, How with the length of his extended limbes He does surcharge the Charger: how the brims With lust-full Sperage are all ouer-stor'd? with what a taile, he ouer-tops the bord? Jn seruice first borne-vp betwixt the hands Of that vast Yeoman; But, for thee, there stands A puny-Cray-fish, pent in halfe a shell, The dish not feast enough for one in Hell. The fish he tastes, swimmes in an oyle that grew In Campany, and drank Venafrian Dew. But, for the Worts (poore snake) presented thee, Whose pale aspect, shewes their infirmity; They drinke an oyle, much of the Curriers stamp, Exquisite stuffe, that sauours of the lamp. For know, that for your Bord, is billeted An Oyle that from the Lybian Cane is shed The burthen of a sharpe Numidian Prow; An Oyle, for whose strength Romans disauow To Bathe with Boccharis: an Oyle whose smell 'Gainst Serpents, doth an Amulet excell. Next, for my Lord, a Mullet see seru'd-in, Sent from the Corsicke shore; or of a fin Bred in Sicilia's Taurominian-Rockes, All our Seas being exhausted: all our Flockes Spent and destroy'd, while our luxurious diet Makes hauocke, and our Kitchins neuer quiet Still with vnwearied nets, that no truce keepe Ransacke the entrayles of th' adioyning deepe; Nor respite our Etrurian Frie to grow, And now our markets, their chief purueiance owe To some remote, and ditionary coast; Thence come the Dainties, that our Kitchins boast. Such as to buie, the vulture Lenas deignes: Such as to sell, Aurelia enterteines. In messe with that, behold for Virro lies A Lamprey of an exemplary Size, That for dimension beares the price from all Which Gulphes Sicilian sent his Festiuall, For while the South conteynes himselfe; while he Lies close, and dries his feathers in his Lee, Our greedy Pursenets for their gaine despise The danger that in mid Charibdis lies. Now, for his Lamprey, thou art glad to take An Eele, neere cozen to a hideous Snake, Or els a freckled-Tiberine, bit with frost, And he, the poorest slaue of all the coast; Fed with the torrent of the common Sewer, And swims the towne-ditch, (where 'tis most impure. Here would I on himself a word haue spent, So he inclind an eare beneuolent: Nor doe we such beneuolences craue, As Seneca his meane acquaintance gaue; Such as good Piso; such as Cotta made To deale for Largesse; a familiar Trade; For times haue beene, that in the worlds account, The title of munificent did mount Aboue triumphant, or imperiall Baies: But our desire, in this due limit staies, That you will make, when you entreat a guest, Ciuill respect the Steward of your Feast: Doe this and be (as many Lords are more) Rich to your-selfe, and to your followers, poore. Before him see a huge Goose-liuer set, A Capon cramb'd, euen with that Goose; for great A whole wild Boare, hid in his smoaking heat That gold-lock't Meleagers dart deseru'd, And after all this, Virro's-selfe is seru'd With pure-dress'd Mushroms: be the spring then freed, And wished thunders, make his meales exceed. And then the Gully-gut (Aledius) cryes O Lybia, keepe with thee thy Wheates and Ries, And ease thy Oxen, sending these supplies. And that no indignation want to thee; (As bound t'obserue) the Caruer thou must see Dancing about his businesse: and he That teaches him the Lawes, to the true life Of caruing comely; with his flying knife Touching at euery ioynt he carues, before He dares th' attempt; till not a gesture more In all his dictates can deserue offence, Nor must your note faile, how huge difference There is 'twixt the vnlacing of your hare, And Hens dissection: 'gainst which, if you dare But whisper, like a three-nam'd Noble man, Like Cacus, struck by hands-Herculean, Thou shalt bee, by the heeles, drag'd forth the place: But when doth Virro then vouchsafe the grace To drinke to thee? Or touch the Cup that thou hast, with thy lippes prophan'd? Or which of you So desperate is? so lost? to bid the King Drinke to me Sir? No: there is many a thing, That thred-bare coates dare not for feare bring forth, But if some god, or god-like man; or worth Better then Fate, would Wealth bestow on thee, Fit to maintaime a Knight of Romes degree, How huge a peece of man should'st thou ascend Rais'd out of nothing? how much Virro's friend? Giue Trebius; Set to Trebius; Brother (now) Please you these puddings taste? O moneys, you He giues this honour: you, these Brother are, Yet notwithstanding, if thou please to share His Lordship with him; or become his King You must to Court no young Aeneas bring Nor daughter (though his daintier) to be Play-pheeres with Virro's daintiest progenie, But Childlesse be: a pleasing and deare friend A barren wife makes: but suppose she lend Thy lappe much issue (euen at one birth three) So thou be Rich, Virro will ioine with thee, Jn ioy of that thy prating progenie; And euer when the Infant Parasite Comes to the Table, asking his delight, Virro commands it, all his appetite To all his cheap-priz'd friends, they serue the bord With dangerous Toad-stooles: Mushroms for my Lord, But such as Claudius pleas'd to tast, before His wif's guift came, that made him tast no more. Virro commands for him, and all the rest Of the Virronian rancke, fruit of such Feast As thou shalt onely in their odour eat; Such as Phæacia's endlssse autumnes sweat; Or thou wouldst thinke got from the golden trees That grew in guard of the Atlantides, Where thou eat'st spaky fruit, of that sowre sort That fresh-traind-souldiers feed on in their fort, Bestow'd on them in practise of their Art At a stuft goat-skin, to bestow a dart, Fearing for their default, the scourges smart. Perhaps, for sauing cost, thou maist conceiue That Virro feeds thee so: No: 'tis to greeue Thy greedy liquorous appetite, because There is no Comedy of more applause, Nor any excellentest Zany can, More then a weeping-gut, delight a man: All is then done: (if we must teach thine eares) To make thee purge thy choler by thy teares, And liue still gnashing of thy great-eye-teeth, Thou think'st, he thinks thee free; &amp; not beneath Guests for his loue and Grace: but he knowes well Thee onely taken with his kitchins-smell: Nor thinks amisse: For who, so naked liues, That twice, on his entreates, attendance giues? Vaine hope of supping well, deceiues you all: But see (say you) that halfe-eat hare will fall Jn his guift, to our shares: Or of that bore Some little fragments, that his Hanches wore: Or sure that Cap'net; when, for all prepar'd; (Your musty bread par'd cleane) and no bit shar'd Of all those meats of marke, and long'd-for dishes Your vaine hopes vanish, and y'are mute as fishes. He's wise that serues thee so: for if thou can Beare all, thou shouldst: and he's no vniust-man That layes all on thee, euen to stoope thy head To the fooles Razor; and be buffeted: Which if thou dost, nor let'st thy Forage feare Besides to suffer Virro's whipping cheare, With all the sharpe Sauce, that he can extend, Thou'rt worthy such a feast, and such a friend.
