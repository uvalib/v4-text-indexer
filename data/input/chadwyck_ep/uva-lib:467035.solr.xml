      <field name="fulltext">“ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO ?” THE BATTLE OF THE “ANNUALS.” O Mars! thou God of Battles fierce!— O pugilistic Cribb! O guide my fist in this romance, And teach it how to—fib. “Come, gentle Spring!”—pride of the Ring, That oft a nose hast broke, Instruct my muse to make a “hit,” Eke with a playful “stroke.” And of thy spirit, in my mind Infuse a little drop, And lest my wit should run too fast, O! teach me where to “stop.” And ye, O small-beer Critics! stay Your pens, while I recite; For I too wield a lusty pen, That all my wrongs can—write! And now, my Public, list while I A wordy strife rehearse, And tell in verse, in merry turn, Of many a reverse. “The Battle of the Annuals” May yield at least some sport; The public voice their trumpet is, And verse and prose their—forte! 'Tis strange, but true, and right well known, They all are bitter foes,— No wonder yearly blossoms should From blossoms come to blows. For precedence they boldly strike, Nought can their warmth repress,— They all are volunteers, although The offspring of the “press.” In leather trappings some appear, While others silk reveal; And most, like knights of other days, Are arm'd with plates of steel. The lordly “Keepsake” lauds himself, And is “all vain enough;” But 'neath his silken robe there peeps A garb of—common stuff! In vain it boasts its gaudy hues, By men of rank drawn out;— That all his contributions are Rank nonsense, none can doubt. But lo! he marches to the ground, Prepar'd for the assault; Goosequills are bristling in the air, The lines, as usual—halt! The Critic thinks it some “review”— And quick his armour dons; He cons the prose, and cuts it up, With many pros and cons. Now from the “Heath” a band arise, An Amazonian train; The “Book of Beauty” leads them forth For conquest on the—plain! O! doubtless they can make a “head,” They march so firm “eyes right;” I'd send them all to L. E. L.— Their praises to indite. The “Landscape” boldly “takes the field,” Like hound upon the scent; They're all in tent:—the “Amulet” On preaching is intent. The “Literary Souvenir” too Appears with “lines” in lots; “What's in a name?” who cry, will find Taste in the name of Watts! Its numbers are so musical, Just like a “band” they chime— For though old Time hath verse improv'd, Yet Master Watts “beats time.” The “Comic Offering” unfolds Her banner to the breeze— Just like a satin pincushion All full of points—that please— But never wound!—the leader is Far too polite, that's poz! So honest too—some wish that she A “little sharper” was! The “Picturesque” appears in view, And not without his “tale;” He soars o'er mountains, and unlike A novice takes the “vale.” The “Friendship's Offering” comes forth:— The “Comic” cries, no doubt, “'Twill be a pleasant game, in which Two ‘Offerings’ are out!” And lo! the brave “Forget-me-not” Comes boldly in the van; Arm'd at all points, the skilful Muse Bids fair to hack her man! The “Oriental” surely doth On “elephant” appear; But in the rear it takes its “post,” And “foolscap's” doom'd to wear. “Though last, not least in our dear love!” The “Comic” comes to claim Its meed of praise,—as at a feast To meat succeeds the “game.” Each chief essays to win the palm By loud and vaunting boast; 'Tis evident there'll be a “broil” 'Mong those who'd “rule the roast.” “You know,” the “Comic Offering” cries, “I've made a noise, full well.” “A noise!” exclaims the “Comic;” “yes, Just like a muffled bell!” “Ah! I shall live,” she cries, “when thou On Styx art cut adrift—” “Yes, then,” the “Comic” cries, “the world With thee will make a shift! “But when I die ‘choice spirits’ shall Embalm me in the grave; But, O! whate'er thy faith may be, Thy ‘good works’ ne'er will save!” Deploying now upon the plain, Each leader shows his force, Resolving in the race of Fame To take the shortest course; And, like the valiant chiefs of old, Prepares to make a speech; And all his men, however “taut,” Determines now to teach. The noble “Keepsake,” with a bow, Steps forth, all clad in red, And cries—(with fingers in his curls)— “I've something in my head! “O yes! ye lords and ladies bright, Whom none in prose can match, Or sonnetteering—come with me, I'll lead you to the scratch. “I'll put my best leg foremost, and I'll nothing do by halves; If calves they call ye—I will hide ‘In crimson boots my calves!’ “In this wide field I'll never shrink With low-born, sneaking fear, For I (who 'm bound to many lords) Hold I'm bound to a-peer! “Then strike, my Tulips! never heed, But tip 'em like for like; For if we get the worst—why then, My lords, we can but—strike! “The base canaille in vain compete, For them there is no hope; Their prose will have a period soon— Their ‘lines’ deserve a rope! “Then ‘strike the light guitar!’ my lords, For you alone 'tis strung,— Your praises loud, throughout the land, How many belles have rung!” The “Landscape” cries, “Stand firm, my friends; Who can their aid refuse? For we must win:—I'm proud to say, The world approves our ‘views.’ “In war we are no novices, To us 'tis only sport; Cities we've ta'en with ease, and oft A battlemented fort! “An ‘Artist’ is our Treasurer— Whom we both praise and thank; For funds we ne'er shall want, for he Can draw on any bank! “Yes! he can blow, or paint a cloud, For no foe cares a rush; And though they hunt him like a fox, He'll never lose his brush! “The jealous foe may charge on foot Or horse with clanging hoofs, Howe'er our courage they may doubt, We'll quickly give them ‘proofs.’” The “Amulet,” in cassock drest, Steps forth with solemn gait; With eyes and body lowly bent, His force addresses straight:— “O Brethren! O Brethren! Let's forth and fight the fight; Our might is small, but 'twill increase, Just like the widow's mite! “Morality and virtue shield Our bosoms from the lance, Then let our ‘columns’ on, and dare The light of truth advance. The “Book of Beauty,” smiling sweet, Just like a rose arose! “O, lovely Amazons!” she cried, “We all can bend our—beaux! “Then nothing fear, I'll lead ye on, Like Dian in the hunt; Our foes shall quickly find we wear No—‘artificial front.’ “Yes, they shall fall, like autumn leaves, And”—adding while she laugh'd— “An arrow 'scape 'twill be to those Who shall avoid my shaft! “And should they rudely break our squares, And make us yield our ground; We'll ‘compass them, and quickly prove That we can fight—around!’ “Both right and left we'll pour our darts, Their terror to increase; We'll harass them;—we'll take their guns, And leave the foe—no piece! “But should they, heartless, still refuse To yield to Beauty's arms, Like witches we must have recourse To our unfailing charms!” Upon a huge white elephant The “Oriental” came; His look was wild, and all confess'd They never found him—tame! “Gems of the world!” he blandly cried, “Stand firm, whate'er betide; They'll never beat us in the field, We are too big—to hide! “Like ostrich eggs, we'll crack 'em all, And strew them on the sands! Like well-groom'd barbs they all shall be Well curried by our hands. “'Tis true, they roar like tigers fierce, And threaten us with wipes— O! if they must be tigers, we Will furnish them with stripes! “The fools deceive themselves, and think We cannot drill a corps; And when they see my elephant, Mistake him for a—bore! “But shrink not, I will lead ye on, Be stedfast to a man; And though they mock our diligence, They shall not mock our van! The “Comic Offering” appears, In muslin white array'd; Quite recherchée and à-la-mode, And well used to—parade! In look a hero!—and her wit So delicate and fine; Its point is quite invisible— 'Tis jest—in a decline! “When Greek meets Greek,” she smiling cries, “Then comes the tug of war!” As I have seen two sparrows fight All at the Beulah Spa! “The front shown by the enemy In me breeds no alarms; Arm'd cap-à-pié although it be, 'Tis but a—child in arms! “Yon rival, ‘Comic,’ (vulgar fool!) That plays such antic tricks, May boast his ‘cuts’—but I have learn'd To dance, and can ‘cut six.’ “Ye know he always lags behind; Aye, last upon the scene, Backward in coming forth—while I Have ever ‘forward’ been. “Yes, let them sneer; I've ‘troops of friends,’ Well arm'd with shafts of wit; Suppose they strike—they hit a-miss— While your miss proves a hit! “Nay, singly I dare take the field, And down my gauntlet fling; With any champion I'll engage, If he'll provide—the ring! “Because I'm of the softer sex They fancy I shall quake; But all their threaten'd beating ne'er Thy chief can ‘softer’ make! “Then, draw the sword, mes camarades! At least we'll try a pass; And soon we'll crop these boasting blades, As they were blades of grass!” “Bravo! bravo!”—the marshall'd foe, Her speech in mock'ry greet: She frowns, and cries, “These bravoes soon “With huzzas we will meet!” Now speaks the “Friendship's Offering” To his assembled band: “Bards! put your best leg foremost, for “Your feet will all be scann'd. “In a fine frenzy roll your eyes, And turn your collars down, For, oh! 'tis neck or nothing now, Which shall surprise the town. “Genius of Grub Street! lend your aid, (You cannot be a-verse!) Then vain shall Cockney critics cry, Your rhymes were never worse! “Ye prosing gentlemen, who've hacks, Round to their tails, pray, turn; Then (though there's none of you are swift) At least you'll look a-stern! “Ye sentimental sonnetteers, Whom all the ladies prize, In fustian dress'd, look big, and win The damsels by your—size! “Oh, Pathos! lead our cavalry, And none shall 'scape their fate; Heavy they all acknowledge you, And must yield to your weight. “Then let us forward, in their wheel We'll quickly put a spoke; With us, if they will ‘pick a crow,’ They speedily shall croak! “Forget-me-not!” the veteran, Shook back his silver locks; “This preaching's very fine,” he cried; “We'll answer them with knocks! “Unfurl our standard! march in peace! The coward only brags; None who beneath our banner fights, In spirit ever flags. “First in the field, we led the way To glory and to fame! We sought a name—we hit the mark, So true we took an aim! “The sun of favour smiled on us, And lo! these shadows came, As diff'rent from the substance as Vile maggots are to game! “They talk of striking!—save the mark! I heed not what they say; For, if they strike, like many more, 'Twill be—for lack of pay. They strike! yes, downwards they will strike, Like roots in garden lands; Or, like an eight-day clock, they'll strike, That is—not with their hands! “Then on, my comrades, bold and free, 'Gainst them we'll stand alone; Their trumpeters will surely be— Just like their trumpets—blown! “They've ta'en the field, but not the town; No! that is still our own; They'll change their note—like dog's-meat men— Unto a barrow-tone! “Then shout aloud, ‘Forget-me-not!’ And buckle on the targe; Wave brand and spear high in the air, And—like a lawyer—charge!” The “Picturesque” stood forth with grace, And cried, “The foe looks big! But all that meddle with our branch, Shall quickly ‘hop the twig.’ “O! soon these churls that are so free We will our pris'ners make; For them, like trees in winter keen, Without their leaves, we'll take. “Draw! draw! (they cry) enough to scare A park of nurs'ry maids! We have no need to shout, for we Are fam'd for—drawing blades! “I've ta'en a ‘bird's-eye view’ of them; They all are mighty fine! But soon the upstart fools shall find The ‘horizontal line.’ “They think they shall increase their fame, This is their ‘point of sight;’— Their ‘point’ must be the ‘vanishing,’ We'll prove in their despite. “We're Englishmen! all thorough-bred, (Where will they find the like?) Then fear no blows, for if they hit, They'll at ‘right Angles’ strike. “Our cause is just, then let us treat The jeering foe with scorn; They boast of their uprightness, but All on ‘one side’ they're drawn. “They're like unfinish'd sketches yet, However loud they talk; One good oil picture surely, lads, Is worth a score in chalk. “With such a prospect, let us on And press the puny corps; Soon in the ‘back-ground’ they will be, While we are in the ‘fore.’” The “Literary Souvenir” spoke In accents sweet and bland:— “Display your colours, friends, for we At least can boast—a stand! “The foe may vaunt their heavy horse, (They're only fit for drays,) But we ('tis not assuming much)— We too can boast our ‘bays!’ “Like flaring poppies, 'neath the scythe, Shall our opponents fall; They undertake, in vain, to please The undertaker's pall!’ “Like dew-drops, that begem the blades Of grass at early morn, Shall tears of sorrow overflow The face of all the lorn! “Pan may defy Apollo, but Compete with him ne'er can;— So will our foe's boast truly prove A mere flash in the pan. “As from the boughs the rime-frost flies, When Sol appears by times, So shall our dazzling brightness melt And dissipate their rhymes! “They fondly dream to win applause (I know their politics), But, oh! they'll never get a ‘notch,’ Unless they ‘cut their sticks.’” With lath in hand, and cap and bells, And coat of motley hue, The “Comic,” hearing others “crow,” Cried—“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” And pricking o'er the plain he came Upon a donkey's back— And said:—“Whatever others get My beast will have his—‘whack!’ “Courage, my boys! with placid smiles Let ev'ry phiz be deck'd; Calm let us be as summer sea— As if we nothing reck'd! “Fear nought from all this proud array, An awkward squad at best; And speedily these raw recruits Shall by our hands be dress'd! “They seek for fame, but History Will blink them, by the mass! Four words will suffice for the host; Just these: ‘It came—to pass!’ “Of their ‘crack’ regiments they may talk— Vain talk it is, alack! But I will match 'em, for I'll make My own with laughter crack.” “For all their grave and serious looks I do not care a pin; For though I wield a wooden sword, My cuts shall make them grin! “Yes! they may laugh at my ‘designs,’ While they design in vain; I'll ne'er retreat—or if I cut, I'll cut and come again. “Dare any singly meet me here, He surely will be spilt: For I can joust as well as jest, And I can—run a Tilt!” Loud rang the trumpets to assault, The colours waved on high— Those colours that were “warranted” Neither to “run nor fly.” “The Landscape” beat the “Picturesque;” “Souvenir” the “Keepsake” beat; “The Comic” beat the “Offering,” And she beat—a retreat! The “Amulet” preys! The “Oriental” 'tis plain, “another Daniel,” and a sugar-cane! The “Forget-me-not” no concession; a great impression. But how the Battle ended, we, O, reader! cannot say;— For “Volumes of Smoke” we could not see Who bore the palm away.</field>
