THE AUTHOR Wie nimmt ein leidenschaftlich Stammeln Geschrieben sich so seltsam aus! Nun soll ich gar von Haus zu Haus Die losen Blaetter alle sammeln Was eine lange weite Strecke Im Leben von einander stand, Das kommt nun unter Einer Decke Dem guten Leser in die Hand. Doch schaeme dich nicht der Gebrechen, Vollende schnell das kleine Buch; Die Welt ist voller Widerspruch, Und sollte sich's nicht widersprechen! Goethe BOOK I.CLIO. ??? ??????? ?????? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ???? ????????????? ????, ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ?? ???. —Plato. The solemn League and Covenant Cost Scotland blood, cost Scotland tears! But Faith sealed Freedom's sacred cause; If thou'rt a slave indulge thy sneers.—Burns. THE TWO MEEK MARGARETS. The brutal and unfeeling martyrdom of Margaret Wilson and Margaret M'Lauchlan on the eleventh of May 1685 will remain for ever in the minds of the Scottish people, as a memorial of that perverse and pig-headed generation of crowned formalists, who employed themselves for more than a ccntury in forcing Episcopacy upon a people essentially Presbyterian. See Macaulay, ch. iv. I have followed Wodrow. It fell on a day in the blooming month of May, When the trees were greenly growing, That a captain grim went down to the brim O' the sea, when the tide was flowing. Twa maidens he led, that captain grim, Wi' his red-coat loons behind him, Twa meek-faced maids, and he sware that he In the salt sea-swell should bind them. And a' the burghers o' Wigton town Came down, full sad and cheerless, To see that ruthless captain drown These maidens meek, but fearless. O what had they done, these maidens meek, What crime all crimes excelling, That they should be staked on the ribbed sea-sand, And drowned, where the tide was swelling? O wae's me, wae! but the truth I maun say! Their crime was the crime of believing Not man, but God, when the last false Stuart His Popish plot was weaving. O spare them! spare them! thou captain grim! No! no!—to a stake he hath bound them, Where the floods as they flow, and the waves as they grow, Shall soon be deepening round them. The one had threescore years and three; Far out on the sand they bound her, Where the first dark flow of the waves as they grow Is quickly swirling round her. The other was a maiden fresh and fair; More near to the land they bound her, That she might see by slow degree The grim waves creeping round her. O captain, spare that maiden grey, She's deep in the deepening water! No! no!—she's lifted her hands to pray, And the choking billow caught her! See, see, young maid, cried the captain grim, The wave shall soon ride o'er thee! She's swamped in the brine whose sin was like thine; See that same fate before thee! I see the Christ who hung on a tree When His life for sins He offered; In one of His members, even He With that meek maid hath suffered. O captain, save that meek young maid; She's a loyal farmer's daughter! Well, well! let her swear to good King James, And I'll hale her out from the water! I will not swear to Popish James, But I pray for the head of the nation, That he and all, both great and small, May know God's great salvation! She spoke; and lifted her hands to pray, And felt the greedy water, Deep and more deep, around her creep, Till the choking billow caught her! O Wigton, Wigton! I'm wae to sing The truth o' this waesome story; But God will sinners to judgment bring, And His saints shall reign in glory. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF JAMES RENWICK. James Renwick, the last of the noble Scottish band of protesters for liberty of conscience, suffered martyrdom in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh in the month of February 1688. This pure-minded, generous, and intrepid youth, of whom the then world of hirelings and time-servers was not worthy, publicly declared and subscribed the great principle of the Revolution of 1688, at a time when the majority of the best public men of that day were only beginning to dream of its possibility. Eternal honour to his name, the brave, the heroic, the unsullied! When our petty squabbles of Church politics shall have passed away from the hearing of Time, as a shallow din of tinkling cymbals, the name of Renwick shall live in the thoughts of the philosophical historian, as one of the greatest of the great. “Strongest minds Are often those of whom the noisy world Hears least.” Renwick was born in Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, near the beautiful little village of Minnyhive, where a neat little monument has recently been erected to his memory. Weep, Scotland, weep! Thy hills are sad to-day, But not with mist or rack that skirs the sky. The violent rule; the godless man holds sway; The young, the pure, the innocent must die! Weep, Scotland, weep! thy moors are sad to-day, Thy plaided people walk with tearful eye. For why? He dies upon a gallows-tree Who boldly blew God's trump for Freedom and for thee! 'Tis a known tale; it hath been so of old, And will be so again; yet must we weep! High on red thrones the blushless and the bold Hold state; the meek are bound in dungeons deep. Wolves watch the pen; the lion robs the fold, While on soft down the hireling shepherds sleep. God's holy church becomes a mart, where lies Pass free from knave to fool, but Christ's true prophet dies. A youth was Renwick, gentle, fair, and fine; In aspect meek, but firm as rock in soul; By pious parents nursed, and holy line, To steer by truth, as seamen by the pole. In Holland's learned halls the word divine He read, which to proclaim he made the whole Theme of his life; then back to Scotland came, At danger's call, to preach in blessed Jesus' name. They watched his coming, and the coast with spies Planted to trap him; but he 'scaped their snare. To the brown hills and glens of Kyle he hies, And with a stedfast few finds refuge there. On the black bogs, and 'neath the inclement skies, In rocky caves, on mist-wreathed mountains bare, The youthful prophet voiced God's tidings good, As free as Baptist John by Jordan's sacred flood. Fierce fumed the ruthless king. By statute law, To sing God's praise upon a purple hill Was treason. Courtly slaves with envy saw One unbought soul assert a manly will, And with his own hands from those fountains draw, Which sophists troubled with pretentious skill To make them clearer; as if God's own plan For fining human dross must beg a stamp from man! Wide o'er the moors now tramp the red dragoons, To hunt God's plaided saints from every nook; And from a court of bravoes and poltroons Goes forth the law which takes the blessed book From the free shepherds' hands, that hireling loons May spell it to a sense that kings may brook. Far raged o'er heath and hill the despot's sword, But faithful Renwick preached, and owned no human lord. Bold as when Peter in the temple stood With John, and, at the gate called Beautiful, Healed the lame man, and stirred the spiteful mood Of priest and high-priest, holding haughty rule; Witless! who weened that God's apostles should With human law and lawyers go to school: So boldly Renwick stood; and, undismayed, With firm unfaltering faith, God and not man obeyed. And faithful people loved him. From green Ayr, Nithsdale, Glencairn, Sanquhar, and founts of Ken, Free pilgrim feet o'er perilous pathways fare, To hear young Renwick preach in treeless glen; And mothers bring their new-born babes, to bear Baptismal blessings from his touch; and when Fearless he flings the glowing word abroad, Full many a noble soul is winged with fire from God. Yet must he die! The fangs of Law are keen; False Law, the smooth pretender of the Right, That still to knaves a sharp-edged tool hath been, To give a fair name to usurping Might! By Law round noble Hamilton, I ween, The faggot blazed to feed proud Beaton's spite; And now when Scotland's best, to please the Pope And Romish James, must die—'tis Law that knots the rope! Let loose your hounds, cold-blooded lawyers! pay The knave to trap the saint! Your work is done. Young Renwick falls, to venal spies a prey, And lawless Law kills Scotland's purest son. The grey Grassmarket heard him preach to-day, On the red scaffold's floor. His race is run. Now kings and priests, with brave light-hearted joy, May drain their cups, nor fear that bold truth-speaking boy! Weep! Scotland, weep! but only for a day; Frail stands the throne, whose props are glued with gore; For a short hour the godless man holds sway, And Justice whets her knife at Murder's door. Weep, Scotland! but let noble Pride this day Beam through thine eye with sorrow streaming o'er; For why?—Thy Renwick's dead, whose noble crime Gave Freedom's trumpet breath, an hour before the time! LINES WRITTEN IN WIGTON CHURCHYARD. The churchyard of Wigton is beautifully situated on a rising ground overlooking the lovely bay of Wigton. Immediately south of the town the river Bladnoch flows into the bay, at the mouth of which the two Margarets were drowned by the brutal dragoons of James II. The inscription on the tombs of the martyrs still exhibits the old inscription in characters particularly fresh and clear. On a rising ground behind the town an obelisk has very recently been erected in memory of the martyr maidens. Brave brother Scot, who in that name Nursest the pride that worth may claim, Come here; and let no Southron blame Thy free-shed sorrow O'er martyrs' graves, whence our true fame And strength we borrow! No pillared pomp enroofs the dead, Who for their country's freedom bled; No bannered hatchments overspread These grave-stones hoary; But tears with sacred virtue shed Keep green their glory. Look on those granite hills around, Strong, but more strong Scotch hearts were found, When to the cruel stake were bound Stout Galloway's daughters, And for dear Christ, his love, were drowned In briny waters. Meek womanhood, how strong art thou, When truth thee binds and holy vow! For thee no trumpet blows, I trow, Nor chariot rattles; But Love, throned on thy constant brow, Wins blameless battles. A curse dwell with your evil name, Strachan and Winram, Grierson, Graham! On hangman's hest unblest ye came To Wigton waters, And staked i' the swelling tide—O shame! Her high-souled daughters! Torn from sweet life, so young, so good, And cast to the devouring flood, For that your independent mood The Pope's crowned minion Spurned, when uncalled he dared intrude On Christ's dominion! Weep!—it is well to weep; for why? Not for their sakes who so did die, But, 'fore the righteous God on high, To find expression, For burning hate of tyranny, And damned oppression! Such tears make men. Let foplings sigh For pomp of dainty prelacy; But, while we read with streaming eye These grave-stones hoary, We'll train stout hearts to live and die For Christ, His glory. Wigton 1859. A SONG OF CARDINAL BEATON. —See Knox's History, vol. i. p.173, whom I have closely followed. The deed celebrated in the text took place in the year 1546. That it was not a murder in the criminal sense of the word, but a just retribution for wicked deeds, besides being politically a wise act, no impartial thinker can doubt. Beaton was a man who intruded into the Church of Christ, as his greatest admirers admit, from purely ambitious and worldly motives; and being seated in the seat of the Holiest, this godless and cruel man used his unsanctified power for the purpose of persecuting and annihilating the only men then existing who were faithfully preaching the truth of God in this land. In the eye of Heaven, Beaton was a traitor and a murderer. He murdered Wishart; and if he was murdered himself afterwards, he had no more right to complain than any other mortal who has been made to feel the eternal justice of that text, “Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed”. The talk about Law and Legitimate authority in such cases may amuse the shallow and console the coward; but it has no meaning to the consistent thinker. Those who talk with a pious horror of assassination ought to bear in mind, that when wolves in sheep's clothing exercise open force over the sheep, there is nothing for the faithful shepherd but to use secret force, when opportunity offers. The magistrate has no right to bear the sword in support of injustice; nor do Cardinals enjoy any sacred privilege to dye their stockings purple in the blood of just men. As to the policy of the act there can be no doubt. Beaton was the most talented and the most energetic captain of injustice and advocate of lies in those days; and his death gave the Reformation room to breathe and to grow, which otherwise might have been crushed under the squelch of his ruthless foot. The Cardinal slept in St Andrew's tower, 'Twixt the morning grey, and the midnight hour, And he dreamt of his leman, a lady fine, Who mingled sweet phrase with the sparkling wine, Whispering, whispering, daintily so— “Cardinal Beaton to Rome shall go, And wear the tiara, my priestly joe!” The Cardinal heard her sweet lips' flow, But he did not hear the chorus wild, That moaned through the night, with words not mild, Saying, Down to hell!—for so 'tis right— With Cardinal Beaton, the Pope's proud knight, Who murdered Wishart, the godly wight! Down—down—down—to hell With the Pope and Cardinal Beaton! The Cardinal slept in his strong sea-tower, When the sun rose bright in the morning hour, And he dreamt no more of his lady fine, But he heard strange sounds through the fumes of his wine. He heard a clatter, he heard a fall, He heard a clink, and an angry call, He heard a shout that rent the air, And he heard the tramp of a foot on the stair: But he did not hear the words of Fate, Deep-muttered from hell's black yawning gate, Saying, Down to hell!—for so 'tis right— With Cardinal Beaton, whose haughty spite Murdered Wishart, the godly wight! Down—down—down—to hell With the Pope and Cardinal Beaton! The Cardinal rose; from the window he cried, Who's there?—They've ta'en thy palace of pride! He ran to the postern-gate; but, lo! It was bolted and barred, and watched by the foe! Behind his chamber-door he made With chests and benches a barricade; But with smoking coals and wreathed flame They stormed the door,—and in they came! Ah! then he heard, but he heard too late, The grim death-chant of the vengeful Fate, Saying, Down to hell!—for so 'tis right— With blood-stained Beaton, whose haughty spite Murdered Wishart, the godly wight! Down—down—down—to hell With the Pope and Cardinal Beaton! The Cardinal staggered, and back in his chair He fell. They held their daggers bare. O spare me! spare my life! Shall I, A priest, be butchered?—fie! fie! fie! Full well we know that thou art a priest, A murderer foul, and a lecherous beast! They stabbed him once, and they stabbed him twice, And his soul went out, when they stabbed him thrice: And he heard in his ears, as in darkness he fell, The Chorus of judgment with rending yell, Saying, Blood for blood! for so 'tis right, Thou blood-stained Beaton, whose hand did smite The gentle Wishart, the godly wight! Blood cries for blood, in the nethermost hell, With the Pope and Cardinal Beaton! May 1859. SUNDAY AT ETTRICK KIRK. I recommend all persons who visit Abbotsford and Melrose To go on to Selkirk, from whence a pleasant pastoral walk of some twenty miles will take them up to the mountain church of Ettrick, where the famous theologian Thomas Boston lies buried. The scenery is full of green, quiet beauty, of a character very similar to the lovely vale of Newlands, between Buttermere and Derwentwater, in the Lake country. Who has not heard of Boston? I, When I was young, and lived on books, Upon his grave theology, With earnest heart and sober looks, Would pore long hours, while lighter youths Drew out the sleepy morn; nor now Hold cheap that form of close-linked truths, Which I did meekly then allow For sole true gospel. Flippant wits Sneer, and will sneer; but Calvin's plan With Scottish temper nicely fits, To form the iron-purposed man, Who fights for God, when God commands, Fearing nor frowns, nor smiles, nor tears Of man, and to light Pleasure's bands Who sternly stops his practised ears. So may it be!—soft Southern airs Belike may breed soft faiths; but, while The thistle in his cap he wears, For Calvin's creed on Scottish soil No Scotsman blush!—In Ettrick glen I'll pray this day with faith sincere, And worship with the plaided men, Who Boston's godly fame revere. What though no gilded domes uprise, Quaint arch, and curious-pillared tower, No painted lights to charm the eyes; Here men both preach and pray with power. What though no organ's skilful chimes Roll through long aisle or vaulted hall, The broad-browed shepherd, with grave rhymes From lusty heart on God doth call. No nice luxurious faith is here; No cushioned creed for ladies fine; No silken priest, in dainty ear Smoothly to lisp the sleepy line. Here let me worship. Mighty God! Whom our firm Fathers knew with fear, Make thou my heart the chaste abode Of faith, strong, manly, and severe! JOHN FRAZER. I took this story from Simpson's Traditions of the Covenanters, a well-known book, which, notwithstanding some faults of literary execution, gives the reader, by mere accumulation of similar cases, a more vivid idea of the bloody times of tyrannous Episcopacy in Scotland than the most elegant pages of Macaulay. The farm of Dalquhairn is beautifully situated in the mountain solitude, on the hill road between Sanquhar and Carsphairn. The whole of that country is sacred to the memory of our brave peasants, the untitled heroes of “times Whose echo rings in Scotland to this hour.” Happy the man who can drink the breezy mountain air in these green solitudes, and seek for no other company than the memory of these plaided protesters! John Frazer was a pious man, Who dwelt in lone Dalquhairn, Where huge hills feed the founts of Ken, 'Twixt Sanquhar and Carsphairn. King Charles, he was a despot fell; With harlots and buffoons He filled his court, and scoured the hills With troopers and dragoons. For he hated all the godly men, When, free on heather braes, Their hearts would brim with an holy hymn To their great Maker's praise. And he hated good John Frazer, And he bade his troopers ride Up dale and dell, by crag and fell, And snow-wreathed mountain side. One night in bleak December, When the snow was drifting down, John Frazer sate by his ingle-side With his good wife Marion. And they spake, as godly folk will speak, O' the kirk, and the kirk's concerns, Of hair-breadth 'scapes in thousand shapes, And they spake o' their bonnie bairns. Tramp, tramp!—Who's there?—'Tis they, O Heaven! The Devil's own errand loons! They've lifted the latch, and there they stand, Six striding stark dragoons! Too late, too late, thou crop-eared Whig! Too late to turn and flee! To-morrow thou'lt dance thy latest jig, High on a gallows-tree! They bound his arms and legs with thongs, As hard as they were able: Then took him where their horses stood, And locked him in the stable. Then back to the house they came, and bade The sorrowful gudewife pour The stout brown ale—for well they knew She kept a goodly store. The gudewife was a prudent dame: The stout brown ale brought she; They filled and quaffed, and quaffed and filled, And talked with boisterous glee. And many a ribald song they sang, And told in jeering strain How God's dear saints were seized and bound, And hounded o'er the main. And many an ugly oath they swore, That made the gudewife turn pale; But she smoothed her face with a decent grace, And still she poured the ale. And still they drank, and still they sang, And still they cursed and swore: The clock struck twelve! the clock struck one! And still they cried for more. The gudewife was a prudent dame, She broached her ripest store: The clock struck two! the clock struck three! And still the gudewife did pour. Then up and spake the first dragoon; Now mount and grip the reins, boys! It suits not well that a bold dragoon Should drink away his brains, boys! Then up they rose, and, with an oath, Went reeling to the stable; Their steeds bestrode, and off they rode As fast as they were able. With lamp in hand the gudewife rose And to the stable ran, And looked, and looked, till in a nook She found her own gudeman! “Now God be praised!—he's fresh and hale! A mighty work this day The Lord hath done!—the stout brown ale Hath stol'n their wits away.” Eftsoons she brought a huge sharp knife, And cut the thongs in tway; “Now run, gudeman, and save thy life! They'll be back by break o' day!” And off he ran, like a practised man— For oft for his life ran he— And lurked in the hills, till God cast down King Charles and his company. And lived to tell, when over the wave Went James with his Popish loons, How God by stout brown ale did save His life from the drunk dragoons. A SONG OF SCOTTISH HEROES. The title of this song suggests to me the propriety of stating, in a few short sentences, the grounds on which, as a philosophical student of history—for no one will suspect me of partizanship—I am convinced that the Covenanters, who have been so liberally abused by all sorts of fashionable writers, are the only true heroes of the Scottish history of the seventeenth century; and that all attempts to put the Cavaliers in their place must issue in ridiculous discomfiture. (1.) It is quite certain, according to the New Testament and the practice of the first centuries, that the Church of Christ does not mean the clerical order, but it means emphatically and prominently the Christian people, the assembly, the congregation, the body of the faithful. (2.) The Christian people, as such, have an inherent, divine, and inalienable right to act in religious matters according to the free verdict of their conscience, and not to be coerced into creeds or forms of worship by any extrinsic power, clerical or secular. (3.) Any distinct association of human beings, composing what we call a nation, and professing Christianity, is entitled to follow the conscience of the majority in making a national confession of faith, and to resist dictation in this matter, whether from priests or politicians, who, in so far as they attempt to debauch the free national conscience, are usurpers, and ought to be cast down. (4.) The Scottish people did, by many very manifest and indubitable acts, declare and profess their faith in Presbytery as the most scriptural form of church government, according to the best of their insight; and this their declaration was formally confirmed by the Act of Parliament 1560. (5.) Notwithstanding this public and constitutional declaration, King James VI., Kings Charles I. and II., and James II., did, in a most false and treacherous way, form a conspiracy to rob the Scottish people of this their freely chosen faith; and did, during a period of more than one hundred years, proceed to the execution of this conspiracy in a series of public acts, characterised by falsehood, fraud, force, and cruelty of the most atrocious description. (6.) That for these acts resistance to the government of these kings, so far from being criminal, was to be regarded as the highest heroism; and to the men who practised this heroism, in days of gross selfishness and cowardice, the Scottish people owe their independence, and all that is manly and worthy of admiration in their character. (7.) The Scottish Cavaliers, whatever might have been the personal virtues of some of them, or the brilliant qualities of others, were, as a body, engaged in the cause of falsehood, injustice, tyranny, and oppression, and therefore are justly regarded by all true Scotsmen with hatred, and by all philosophical thinkers with pity or contempt. (8.) The principles for which the Covenanters fought and bled, are the very principles which were established by the Revolution of 1688, and which lie at the bottom of the whole political constitution and social philosophy of Britain at the present hour. (9.) Any offensive peculiarities of doctrine or manners exhibited by individual Presbyterians, are no more to be made a ground of reproach against the whole body, than the licentiousness and corruption of the Court of Charles II. are to be set down to the accountof the whole body of the Cavaliers who supported him. (10.) Those who are fond to object to the Covenanters that they were intolerant, ought to bear in mind that toleration in matters of state-religion is an innovation only of yesterday, unknown alike to Plato, the greatest philosopher of ancient times, and to Calvin, one of the greatest theologians of modern times. Besides, toleration, which is a very pretty phrase in times of peace, can have no meaning in times of war. Soldiers do not tolerate one another; they cut one another's throats. So, in times of religious warfare, there can be no toleration, so long as the struggle lasts. We are learning to tolerate Popery only now; and even now not altogether. If the Covenanters were intolerant in those days of a life and death struggle, so were the Episcopalians; only the Covenanters, so long as they remained on Scottish ground, were in the right, and the Episcopalians in the wrong. If a man uses violence in word or deed, it is by no means a matter of indifference of what cause he is the champion, and whether he stands in a defensive or an aggressive position. To be over-zealous in a good cause may often be pardonable; while even a little zeal in the service of falsehood, fraud, and force, is a great sin. (Tune—The Garb of Old Gaul.) I'll sing you a song, if you'll hear me like men, Of the land of the mountain, the rock, and the glen, And the heroes who bled for the old Scottish cause, When the Southron insulted our kirk and our laws; For we'll make a stand for Scotland yet, the Wallace and the Bruce, Though frosty wits may sneer at home, and Cockneys pour abuse! With the fire of Robert Burns, and the faith of stout John Knox, We'll be more than a match for the smooth English folks! In the moor and the mountain, the strath, and the glen, Every rock tells a tale of the brave Scottish men, Of the high-hearted martyrs, who made the king pause, When he swindled our freedom, and tramped on our laws. For we'll make, etc. The king lost his head—fools may whimper and whine; But he lost it, believe me, by judgment divine, When he came, a crowned traitor, to pick wicked flaws In the Covenant, the bond of our old Scottish cause. For we'll make, etc. Our kings were the godly, the grey-plaided men, Who preached on the mountains, and prayed in the glen, When the weak shuffling Charles, who swore false to the cause, Sent his troopers to tramp on the old Scottish laws! For we'll make, etc. There are prigs who will sneer, there are snobs who will laugh, There are fools who will frown, when this bumper I quaff; But here's to the men, who, like grey granite wa's, Stood firm, when the Stuart down trampled our laws. For we'll make, etc. They bled on the bleak moor, they hung on a tree, They pined in black dungeons, were drowned in the sea; But their blood was the cement that soldered our laws, When they bled for their faith in the old Scottish cause. For we'll make, etc. Then here's to the men, who made monarchs to quail, Cargill and Cameron, Guthrie, M'Kail; Their fame shall be sounded with deathless applause, Who fought, bled, and died for our kirk and our laws! For we'll make, etc. THE MERRY BALLAD OF STOCK GEILL. In this ballad I have followed very closely the account given by our genial Reformer in his History, vol. I. p. 260, Laing. The word marmoset, signifying a sort of monkey, is applied by Knox to the idol. I put it into the mouth of the mob. Good lords and ladies, who refuse to bend before a log, I'll tell you of a merry gest, that gave the Pope a shog; A gest that chanced in Embro' town, and in the High Street old, Where Willock taught, and stout John Knox, that faithful preacher bold. Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! the tale I tell is true; We dashed his bones against the stones, and his stump in flinders flew! 'Twas the first day of September, and the priests were all agog, All through the town, with pomp to bear the newly-painted log; For the old Stock Geill, the silly god, was in the North Loch drowned, And they have beaten about about, till a new one they have found. Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! the old god and the new! We dashed his bones against the stones, and his stump in flinders flew! There goes a stir through all the streets, a buzz through all the town; With banners, flags, and crosses they are walking up and down; The Regent queen, the wily Guise, put on her proudest smile, And busked her in her brawest gown, to march with the young Stock Geill. Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! the old god and the new! We'll dash his bones against the stones, and shame the shaveling crew! A marmoset! a marmoset! the Devil work them sorrow! They've brought him from the Grey Friars, and nailed him to a barrow! Then on their heads they lift him, and with sounding pomp they come, With Latin rant, and snivelling chant, and pipe, and fife, and drum. Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! this day the priests shall rue! Against the stones we'll dash the bones o' the idol painted new! A marmoset! a marmoset! the puppet-god to show, West about, and East about, and round about they go; Along the Luckenbooths they trail, and down to big Jack's Close, And the bone of his arm, to work a charm, they kiss at the Abbey Cross! Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! this kissing ye shall rue! We'll dash your bones against the stones, though you're painted fresh and new! Now hold your god, ye shaveling loons!—for the queen she's gone to dine, Full weary from the march, I ween, with Sandy Carpentine; There brews a storm betwixt the Bows—the crowd looks black and grim! They rush!—they spring!—hold fast your god! they'll tear him limb from limb! Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! this dainty godling new! They mass their bands, and with strong hands they'll do! they'll do! they'll do! They rived the nails, they seized him by the feet,—I tell thee true— They dashed his head against the stones—his stump in flinders flew! Thou young Stock Geill, and wilt thou die, poor imp, and give no token? Thy father had a stouter skull, was not so lightly broken! Sing hey Stock Geill! and ho Stock Geill! the silly godling new! We dashed his bones against the stones, and his stump in flinders flew! Then hurly burly! light as straw the priests were blown asunder; They puffed and blew, they panted hot, they gaped with foolish wonder; Down go their crosses! up their skirts! their caps fly in the air; Their surplice flaps; they run as fast as them their legs can bear! Like crows at pop of gun, the grey and black stoled friars flew, Mid curse and sneer, and gibe and jeer, and merry wild halloo! And so this gest was bravely done that gave the Pope a shog, That now no stout Scotch knee might bend before a painted log! The Devil's lumber-room we swept—for thus John Knox did say: Pull down the rookery, and the rooks will quickly fly away! We left no trappings of Stock Geill; that day we ne'er shall rue, When we dashed his bones against the stones, and his stump in flinders flew! THE SONG OF MRS JENNY GEDDES. See Chambers' Annals of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 103, year and date as in the text. The learned author says, on the authority of Wodrow, that the name of this mettlesome dame was not Geddes, but Mean. But, however this be, Fame has baptized her into Geddes, and with that appellation she must live through the ages, and will be famous as long as Scotland and Scotsmen are remembered. (Tune—British Grenadiers.) Some praise the fair Queen Mary, and some the good Queen Bess, And some the wise Aspasia, beloved by Pericles; But o'er all the world's brave women, there's one that bears the rule, The valiant Jenny Geddes, that flung the three legged stool, With a row-dow—at them now!—Jenny fling the stool! 'Twas the twenty-third of July, in the sixteen thirty-seven, On Sabbath morn from high St Giles' the solemn peal was given: King Charles had sworn that Scottish men should pray by printed rule; He sent a book, but never dreamt of danger from a stool. With a row-dow—yes, I trow!—there's danger in a stool! The Council and the Judges, with ermined pomp elate, The Provost and the Bailies in gold and crimson state, Fair silken-vested ladies, grave Doctors of the school, Were there to please the King, and learn the virtue of a stool. With a row-dow—yes,I trow!—there's virtue in a stool! The Bishop and the Dean came in wi' mickle gravity, Right smooth and sleek, but lordly pride was lurking in their e'e; Their full lawn sleeves were blown and big, like seals in briny pool; They bore a book, but little thought they soon should feel a stool. With a row-dow—yes, I trow!—they'll feel a three legged stool! The Dean he to the altar went, and, with a solemn look, He cast his eyes to heaven, and read the curious-printed book: In Jenny's heart the blood upwelled with bitter anguish full; Sudden she started to her legs, and stoutly grasped the stool! With a row-dow—at them now! firmly grasp the stool! As when a mountain wild-cat springs on a rabbit small, So Jenny on the Dean springs, with gush of holy gall; Wilt thou say the mass at my lug, thou Popish-puling fool? No! no! she said, and at his head she flung the three legged stool. With a row-dow—at them now!—Jenny fling the stool! A bump, a thump! a smash, a crash! now gentle folks beware! Stool after stool, like rattling hail, came tirling through the air, With, Well done, Jenny! bravo, Jenny! that's the proper tool! When the Deil will out, and shows his snout, just meet him with a stool! With a row-dow—at them now!—there's nothing like a stool! The Council and the Judges were smitten with strange fear, The ladies and the Bailies their seats did deftly clear, The Bishop and the Dean went, in sorrow and in dool, And all the Popish flummery fled, when Jenny showed the stool! With a row-dow—at them now!—Jenny show the stool! And thus a mighty deed was done by Jenny's valiant hand, Black Prelacy and Popery she drave from Scottish land; King Charles he was a shuffling knave, priest Laud a meddling fool, But Jenny was a woman wise, who beat them with a stool! With a row-dow—yes, I trow!—she conquered by the stool! BOOK II.POLYHYMNIA. ?????????????? ????? ???? ????, ???? ????, ???? ?? ????? ???????????. —Pindar. Odi profanum vulgus et arceo.—Horace. HYMN TO HELIOS. ????? ???????? ????. —Plato. Beautiful orb, that rulest the sky, bright joy of creation, Helios! oldest of gods, when earth, with divinity teeming, Spake to the eye and the heart of a race that believed in their feelings Now they call thee a globe, a fiery sphere in the welkin, Blindly wheeled, the causer of light, but wheeling in blindness; Blindly wheeled by a law, with might despotic, compelling Atoms, and suns, and moons, the dust that turneth the balance, Clouds that float in the sky, and waves that swell in the ocean. Beautiful Sun! whom millions worshipped, bright joy of creation! Still let me deem thee a god!—or, if potent Science deny me This heart-worship, which lived when men had faith in their feelings, I from Philosophy borrow a name to baptize thee—be greeted, Light-giving eye of the God, whose soul is the life of the Cosmos! Eye not seeing, like vision of men, with tamely recipient Organ, but causing to see, creative, procreant, plastic; Eye in which Plato believed, and the broad-viewed thinkers of Hellas, Ere mechanical men, with curious lines and triangles, Measured the skies, and mapped the bald ungodded creation; Eye of the welkin, I praise thee! the glory that waked in the Persian Hymns of awful delight, and sent the Pelasgic Apollo Forth, a glorious youth, with golden locks down-flowing Over the shoulders that bore the quiver with arrows resounding: Me that glory inspires in the clime of the mist-wreathed mountain; Me thy deity stirs in the land, where a jealous theology Watches the words of the wise, and grudges free thought to the thinker. I will praise thee; inspire my heart with flooding emotion! Fill me with thoughts as rich as the leafy tree, which redundant Shakes her tresses around, and waves her beauty before me! Teach me to praise thee with skill, that whoso hears may adore thee, Helios! beautiful orb, the plastic eye of creation! Beautiful Sun! when the procreant breath on the primal waters Brooded, divinely stirring the crude and weltering Chaos, Water, and earth, and air, and fire, in dim elemental Strife inorganic convolved, and rolling in huge confusion, Then thou wert not, beautiful Sun! but evident darkness Struggled with fitfullest fire, in dismal yawning abysses Joyless. Forth from the thought of the all-creative Jehovah Walked thy luminous round with intelligential clearness. Chaos before thee fled; the vast convolutions of darkness Rolled away; the elements, freed from tangled embroilment, Grouped their atoms, and sought in kindred classes to mingle. Thou, bright eye of the world, didst order the infinite discord, Thou, first servant of God, the Supreme Causer of order! Moulded by thee in the slimy swathes of mud primeval, Struggled the formative life in the plant; thy ray calorific Fashioned the germs of growth, and shapes of exuberant beauty Sprang from the bursting clod with leafy splendour enfolden. Gently the blade of the grass came creeping over the meadow; Stately rose the tree; and in graceful rings symmetric, Spread the fresh-green fern its fan to the zephyr gigantic. Beautiful world! from year to year in gladness I greet thee; Yearly the power of the Spring, and the ray of the life-dispensing Glorious Sun invests the old and hoary creation Fresh in juvenile green; and yearly my heart within me Beats to the pulses that stirred, when Helios moulded the Cosmos. Beautiful trees! that with far-sent fangs securely rooted, Clasp the rock, and with rounded stems, erect and stable, Rise to the light; then swinging your arms with opulent leafage Broadly tufted, or finely needled, drooping or spreading, Sway to the breeze: ye forests, that wave with various grandeur, Dark with the veteran pine, or light with the tapering larch-tree, Stout with the bunchy plane, or soft with the fine-leaved linden, Smooth with beech, or rough with the large-flowered spears of the chestnut, Fragrant with pendulous birch, the white-stemmed pride of the dark brown Mountain torrent, that scoops the shelvy bed of the mica: Praised be the beauty of trees! them Helios brought from the darkness, Cherished their seeds in the rift of the rock, and lustily reared them, Richly with verdure to clothe the old grey sides of the mountain. Beautiful flowers! the joy of the meadow, the grace of the garden, Triumph of genial light, disparted in colour, and scattered Wide o'er the verdure of earth, with beneficent wild profusion, Wonderful! filling the eye with continuous feasts, and the heart with Thrills of dainty delight! Full oft in your quest I have wandered Deep into murkiest woods, and high where the pinnacled granite Shelters the snow through the summer, and far where the cataract thunders Over the storm-seamed brow of the grim-indented mountain: There the bell, and the cup, and the purple star have found me, Beautiful, crowning with life the forehead of bleak desolation, Smiling, like children's eyes, with miraculous light from the deep black Yawning chasm, that seemed an abode for barrenness only. Beautiful flowers! or gemming the snow-wreathed hills, or at random Spotting with vegetive gold the broad fat fields of the lowland, Nodding in airy clusters aloft, or broad as a buckler, Floating in lazy pride on the bosom of deep slow waters, 'Neath hot tropical suns; in lowliest guise, like the sorrel Shading its delicate tints 'neath the moss-grown stumps of the forest, Or in magnificent globes high-blown, with petal on petal, Closely-massed, and cunningly cut into curious splendour, Looking in face of the Sun with the vermeil pomp of the Summer; Lovely parade of beautiful growth, divinely unfolden World of colour, I bless thee, and praise the Creator who gave me Eyes to drink in the light, and share thy magical fountain, Helios, beautiful orb, the plastic eye of creation! Beautiful Earth! in vesture of various light enveloped, Glorious! ever to me thy beauty has been as a garden Gemmed with flowery delight, and breathing odorous sweetness! Ever new wonder hath thrilled my wondering eye, beholding Each soft line of thy grace, each ample front of thy grandeur. Oft with vagabond foot thy fields I have traversed at random, Free, with savage delight, by modes and fashions uncumbered, Nourishing thoughts as light as the gull that floats o'er the billow, Breezy and fresh as the Zephyr that tosses the green and plumy Glory of trees in the light, and pouring unsought and unhindered Hymns of vital delight! I praise thee, God, and thy sunlit Earth, the garden of man, as abroad I wander in fancy, Viewing again and again thy wealth of wonderful pictures, Hung in the halls of the soul by thy magical many-hued mirror, Memory, mother of Thought! And now my fantasy lifts me Far to the lands of the South, where Light, like a queen majestic, Sways with sovereign strength, and smiles with broad, diffusive, Liberal brightness unsullied; and there the bluff rock-forehead Stands in the flash of the sea, high-crowned with the nicely-measured Marble pillars, as white as the flower which bursts in the morning, Hung with memories of worship as fair as the light which surrounds them, Dian, or radiant Apollo, or she, the blue-eyed virgin, Daughter of Jove, strong-fathered, with weighty spear and buckler Bright, far-glancing, a sign to the worn sea-wandering sailor. There my fantasy lifts me, and there on sun-woven pictures Feeds and fattens with joy. Or me, with a turn of my musing, Suddenly thought transports to the castled crags of the Rhine stream, Terraced with vines, and brewing by mystic brewst of the sun-light Wine, which gladdens the heart: and there I see in the arbour Knots of men and women, the gentle, the kind, and the thoughtful, Feasting on sunny delights, and the sportive freak of the moment, Harmless-bubbling; or wandering far through mazes of leafy Copse-wood wild, and making the old grey ruin re-echo Free with songs, the voice of an easy sweet-blooded people, Plain, unbribed by the cumbersome pride which fetters the Briton. These thy pictures, O Sun! the living, the varied, the changing Ever, but ever the same, wide-spread in magnificent fulness Wonderful! Who can declare the wealth of luminous glory, Flowing in radiant oceans, where stars are wheeling in mazes Vast, uncounted, unscanned by the glass of the farsighted gazer? Me such glory confounds. I rather, with wise limitation, Feed on the shows of truth, and chiefly the sights of my dear-loved Strong Caledonian home, the land of the flood and the mountain. Beautiful Scotland! or where thy broad hills, smooth, green-mantled, Sink to the vale, far fringed with the pomp of mansion and villa, Rich, well-gardened; or where the might of thy Grampian rises High, far-sweeping, majestic, and flushing far with the purple Springy heather, deer-trodden. How blest to the foot is the labour, High from thy breezy heath to brush the dew, Caledonia! Whether pursuing the stag to his haunt on the lone, rock-girdled Mountain tarn, or regaling the eye with grandeur of high-piled Peak on peak, and feasting the ear with music of waters Rushing adown birch-glens, where the trout in the amber caldron Shoots as swift as a fresh young thought from the brain of the thinker. Here thy glories, O Sun, in the shifting play of the shadow, Thousandfold varied, appear, when the skirt of the delicate-floating Mist now rests on a crag, now round a black tremendous Precipice skirs, as swift as the rush of dreams in a dreamer. Oft on a broad bare mount, Bencleugh, or lofty Muicdhui, Sombre hangs a pall of dark dense cloud from the welkin; Sombre the traveller looks, the unwearied climber of mountains, All his prospect is dimmed, the glory of hills is departed. Sudden the curtain uprises; beneath the rim of the dark cloud Luminous shines the carpeted plain; the silvery landscape Glorious glistens along the line of the shimmering river; Castle and crag gleam out; the old grey-centuried turret Rises over the wood; the white-washed cottage is glinting Far through the dark-blue pine; the spire in the village is twinkling Bright in the Sun; the vents of the populous far-spreading city Shoot their white-blue fumes in beautiful scrolls to the welkin, Telling of labour and power, and thought, the mighty magician. Such thy glories, O Light, on the broad brown mountains of Scotland! Such thy wonderful sleight on the pictured face of the high-land, Helios, beautiful orb, the plastic eye of creation! Beautiful Light! the child from the rayless womb of its mother Sudden emerging, and claiming his lot in a larger existence, Free, self-rooted, self-centred, from thee, thou centre of gladness, Knows the beneficent thrill that quickens the sensuous nervlets, Delicate, timorous, soon to embrace with miraculous grasping Realms of measureless knowledge. By thee the full-grown thinker Nurses his ken, and learns to be wise by looking and loving, Clearly scanning the smallest, and widely surveying the largest Forms of exuberant life, with a full and ripe comprehension. Thine is the circle of Being; the bond art thou that unitest Nearest and farthest of things with a potent function, electric, Wonder-working. By Thee the Earth with the Heaven communeth, Knowing with known, and lover with loved; and through infinite spaces Star sends message to star, and comet shoots greeting to comet. Beautiful Light! with cunning disposal of lens and of mirror Science may torture thy forms, and question thy Protean splendour, Call thee a radiant matter, or feel thy quivering pulses, Telling of rise and of fall in the undulant flow of thy beauty. Me this beauty suffices. I look, and enjoy, and adore thee, Godlike, born of a God, with virtue divinest redundant! Father of lights, receive this lisping hymn of my worship; Thou first Sun of all suns, first glory of glories, and only Substance of all that seems, prime mover of all that moveth, Fill my heart with thy brightness, and teach me with open receptive Faculty ever to live on the fulness of beauty around me! Teach me ever to thrill to the breath of thy grace, as a well-tuned Harp responds to the touch of a subtle and dexterous harper. Thus no discord shall master my fate; and in harmony sweetest Human shall chime with divine. Thus teach me, O Father, to praise thee! Thee, the source of all life, and thy Sun, the joy of all living, High hung up for a sign in the hall of the glorious Cosmos, Helios! beautiful orb, the plastic eye of creation! THE WOOD-SORREL. —The wood-sorrel, oxalis acetosella, very abundant in our Scottish woods. From this plant oxalic acid is extracted. Fair flower, beneath the dark fir-tree Shaded in delicate pudency, I'll make a little rhyme to thee, (Some years I owe it): Pansies and lilies have their praises, Small celandines and broad-faced daisies; But thou, sweet sorrel of the woods, The tenderest grace of solitudes, I do not know it, If thou hast stirred the deeper moods Of any poet. Thou'rt like a maiden in the bud, Bashful, ere life's full-swelling flood Hath shot into the outer blood A bolder feeling. Thy trefoil shield thou spread'st before thee, That I to find thy flower bend o'er thee, And wonder how so lowly there Was set a gem so pure, so fair, Such charms concealing: For why should God create the fair But for revealing? Yet have I seen both fair and good I' the perfect bloom of womanhood, Who, like thyself, the light eschewed, Thou wood-nymph fairest! And wept to think how foplings shallow Left such deep quiet virtue fallow, To feed vain gaze on flaunting show Of painted things, in formal row, The coldest, barest; While thou, low-veiled, and nodding low, Wert blushing rarest. And God, who planted thee, was wise, I' the shade—no vulgar-vended prize For men, whose love is in their eyes, And goes no deeper: Better for thee, and such as thou art, To be the forest-nun thou now art, Than yoked to some loose-dangling mate Whom thou canst neither love nor hate, Thy body's keeper, But to thy sweet soul's estimate Blind, or a sleeper. Me may the God who sways the heart Wean more from each false flaring art, And still some modest truth impart Through thy revealing! As, yearly, sooty crowds eschewing, The fragrant fresh May-breezes wooing, My footed pilgrimage I make Through wood and wold, and passive take Each vagrant feeling, Which thou, and such as thou, can wake With balmy healing. SABBATH EVENING IN ETTRICK. How softly on the broad green hill The golden Eve is sleeping, While, through the vale below, how still The cool grey shade is creeping! The cuckoo's vesper from the wood Floats sweetly through the shadow; The stream, as mild as maidenhood, Is wimpling through the meadow, This Sabbath eve! O Thou, who workest peace from strife By organizing spirit, Whose eye hath fathomed all the life Which mortal men inherit, Soothe thou my thought, and in my mind Rule each distempered motion, That I may love thy law, and find Sweet peace with meek devotion, Each Sabbath eve! THE COTTAGE MANSE. —By the liberality for which the Free Church is so famous, very few of these cottage vicarages are now to be seen; but the verses in the text refer to a period shortly after the Disruption, when Free Church manses were not known. The little cot on the hill side So brown and bare, The lonely cot all white and trim, On the swift mountain torrent's brim, Where the old ash-tree's shattered pride Tells tales of many a storm defied— Who liveth there? Who liveth there? —no common man, A man of God. Though now within this lowly cot He shares the humble peasant's lot, Late, when a public-stationed man, A large house on a goodly plan Was his abode. A minister of sacred things, He bound together, By higher ties than human law, The men that shared his faith with awe, He had his seat at power's right hand, And lords and ladies of the land Did call him brother. But when a fatal strife arose, Hard choice compelling, Snapping old bonds of Church and State, Not with himself held he debate, But with a faithful foot unbought, He with his loved ones sadly sought This low-roofed dwelling. And here he lives, and serves his God On this bare spot; And, though no more in pride he stand Before the mighty of the land, A dear and a devoted few Surround with love, and service true, His humble cot. ELLISLAND. —The farm of Ellisland, occupied by Burns before he took up the gauger trade, lies on the west bank of the Nith, about six miles north of Dumfries. The whole country is passing beautiful, and well worthy of more frequent visits than it receives from our English tourists. To them, also, I recommend a trip into the neighbouring counties of Kirkcudbright and Wigton, districts full of unfrequented and unsuspected beauty. Fair Ellisland, thou dearest spot On Scottish soil to each true Scot, With wood and stream, and shining cot, Thy beauty sways me, And love is rash—O blame me not, If I shall praise thee! Wide waves the leafy June around, The banks with blossomy curls are crowned, Sweet flows with mild and murmurous sound The clear Nith river, And Peace holds all the grassy ground Now sacred ever. The poet's farm!—a fairer sight Ne'er filled my view with calm delight; Full fitly here our minstrel wight Did pitch his dwelling, With Beauty's green and gentle might Around him swelling! Here stands the house, the very wall Stout labour raised at Robin's call, A farmer's beild, which, low and small, No envy breedeth, Enough for comfort, and for all A poet needeth. And there the stack—yard, where he lay And gazed upon the starry ray, When pensive Memory's tender sway, With fingers fairy, Struck from his heart the sad sweet lay Of Highland Mary! And here the bank where he did sit, When once his quick and glancing wit Off—started on a racing fit With glorious canter, And forth with flashing hit on hit Flew Tam O'Shanter! And oft, I ween, to that green bower He walked, in placid evening hour, With bonnie Jean, whose smile had power To soothe his spirit, When fitful thoughts, and fancies sour, Might rudely stir it! Fair Ellisland, thou dearest spot To each true—hearted stalwarth Scot, When I forget thy small white cot And winding river, Sheer from my thought may Memory blot All trace for ever! THE JUNGFRAU OF THE LURLEI. —The Lurlei-rock, on the Rhine above Boppart, is well known to tourists. I took the materials of the legend from Schreiber's Handbuch fur Reisende am Rhein, an old guide- book. Henry Heine's song on the same subject is well known. (A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.) Who sails with pennant waving gay So swift adown the Rhine?— A chief I see with ostrich plume, A chief and boatmen nine. As swallow swift with dipping wing, So swift they glide along, And ever as they lift the oar They raise the merry song. It is the young Count Palatine That fares in that swift boat, And he a deed of strange intent Within his heart hath thought. For he hath heard of the Jungfrau That on the Lurlei stands, And he in haste is coming now On her to lay his hands. By Mary Mother hath he sworn, The maiden shall be mine— Now fresh to work, my merry men, And row we down the Rhine! The pilot was an aged man: Deep thought with blithe content Upon his weather-beaten brow And cheek was friendly blent. “I rede thee, young Count Palatine, I rede thee well,”quoth he, “I am a man of many years, Though but of low degree. “I rede thee well, Count Palatine, My spirit bodes no good Of this strange voyage that we sail; We do not as we should. “The virgin of the Lurlei rock, We know not what she be: She may be of the angel race; She is no bride for thee. “Or an Undine she may be, A daughter of the stream; Rough mortal hand to touch a maid So pure may not beseem. “For ofttimes at calm eventide, As native fishers tell, When mellow shines the parting light, And chimes the vesper bell, “She beckons with a friendly hand, And, pointing to the flood, There, if you fish, she seems to say, Your fishing will be good. “And whoso, with the rising sun, First casts where she hath shown, The choicest fish that Rhine can boast That day he calls his own. “I rede thee well, Count Palatine, My heart misgives me sore, I rede thee, turn from this Jungfrau, And think on her no more.” “Have thou no fear, my pilot true, Thou know'st I mean no harm, The maid shall grace my festal board, Shall rest within my arm. “And be she of Undine tribe, Or of the angel race, The Heaven that gave the heart to dare, Shall crown the deed with grace!” And to his words a loud halloo His merry comrades shouted; The pilot strove to smile in vain; He shook his head, and doubted. And plash, and plash, and hil-hilloa! Still gaily on it goes Adown the stream, till to their view The Lurlei rock uprose. And on that rock there shone a sheen Of mingled sun and moon, And as they nigher came, they heard A strange unearthly tune, But wondrous sweet. The Jungfrau sate Beside the silver sand, And held a string of amber-beads In her uplifted hand. And her the mellow-setting sun And mellow-rising moon Beshone, as moveless there she sate, And sang her witching tune. “Now, by high Heaven! that golden hair, That eye of blue is mine!”— So spake, and sprang with sudden leap The young Count Palatine; But sprang too soon. His hasty step Missed the deceiving shore: The whirling eddy sucked him down; He sank, and rose no more. “Saint Ursel, save us!”cried the men, And rowed them up the Rhine: The maid was seen no more that night, Nor more the moon did shine. The Count was wroth; he loved his son: Three trusty knights sent he, To seize that Jungfrau, and revenge Her wicked sorcerie. For he did deem the childe was drowned By cursed craft of hell; Three holy red-cross knights he sent, To break that fiendish spell. The three knights came. The Jungfrau read Their message on their face; “Touch me no mortal hand, for I Am of Undine race!” She said, and in the deep blue wave Her amber-beads she threw— “Come, father!—welcome, watery home; Ungrateful earth, adieu!” The waves did swell, the waves did roll, The waves did heave them high; Into twin foamy steeds their crests Did shape them fearfully. And on the one a king there sate, Old Kühleborn he hight; He wore an emerald mantle green, With pearls his crown was dight. A sceptre of the watery reed His outstretched arm did wave, And with an eye of ocean's blue, A strong command he gave. And she, the daughter of his love, Besprang the second steed, And louted low before her sire, Who helped her in her need. The waves fell back, the waves fell down; Into their caves they coil; As if by Jesu's voice rebuked, Their face lay calm as oil. The knights beheld it from the rock, Their knees sink down in prayer, And signing many a holy cross, Unto their boats they fare. And on the cradled wave upborne A silver shell they saw; A shining text was writ thereon, They read that text with awe. “Think twice, rash man, before thy foot Disturb a holy spot; The lovely shapes of earth and sky Behold—but touch them not!” THE COVENANTER'S LAMENT. O waly waly up the glen, And waly waly o'er the moor! The land is full of bloody men, Who hunt to death the friendless poor! We brook the rule of robbers wild; They tear the son from his father's lands, They tear the mother from her child, They tear the Bible from our hands! Last night, as I came o'er the moor, And stood upon the grey hill-crown, I saw the red flames rise wi' power Frae the lone house o' Alik Brown. The godless grim dragoons were there, And Clavers spake, that swearing loon, “So burn the nest, so smoke the lair Of all that dare to think wi' Brown!” O blessed Lord, who rul'st in Heaven, Who preached thy gospel to the poor, How long shall thy best friends be driven Like hunted hares from moor to moor? Arise, O Lord, thy saints deliver, This land from ruthless despots free! 'Neath wintry skies we sit and shiver, But times of gladness come from thee! SONG OF THE WINDS. Blow! blow! blow! By the eagle's rocky dwelling, From Fairfield to Helvellyn, Blow! blow! O'er the tempest's leafless track, From Helvellyn to Saddleback. Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! Where the thunder loud is pealing, Round the shepherd's lonely shieling, Blow! blow! Where the torrent wildly dashing, With white flail the rock is lashing, Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! O'er the grey and rocky ruin, Where black cloud is cloud pursuing, Blow! blow! Like demons, with sharp yell, When they hunt a soul to hell, Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! Where the traveller on the hill Wanders blindly without skill, Blow! blow! Whom suddenly a blast Down the sheer black wall shall cast, Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! Where the sapless leaves are whirling, Where the ruddy floods are swirling, Blow! blow! Where the farmer's yellow store Floats to sea with rush and roar, Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! Where the drowning man is calling Through the storm's relentless brawling, Blow! blow! Where with planks and drifted dead Wide the wreathed sands are spread, Blow! blow! Blow! blow! blow! With mist, and rain, and rack, From Scawfell to Saddleback, Blow! blow! Who shall check you in the hour, When God arms your wings with power? Blow! blow! THE SCOTSMAN'S VOCATION. Thou sturdy Scottish man, Still be first in labour's van! 'Tis the mission of the Highest, given visibly to Thee! With the hammer and the spade Ply thine earth-subduing trade, And thou shalt be a prince at home, and a king beyond the sea! Where the ragged thistle grows, There dig, and plant the rose, And make a blooming garden on the bare hill side! Beneath the leafy shade Which thine own hands have made, There claim thy sweatful honours, there nurse thy sturdy pride! By Thee the Titan steam Hove the wonder-working beam, Whose sway is like a thousand horses prancing in their pride! The smoking ships from Thee Went forth that flap the sea, Where the halls of merchant princes fringe the banks of busy Clyde. Thou sturdy Scottish man, Since the Earth to wheel began, There was heavy work to do by land, and heavy work by sea; Still be faithful to thy plan, And the God, who works by man, Hath many a task of world-transforming toil in store for Thee! TRUST IN GOD. Oft on the various-chequered Earth, When dulled with care or flushed with mirth, This feeble thought will force its birth, Tainting the heart with weariness— Why should weak mortals toil and sweat For goods, that vex the few who get, Why for light baubles vainly fret, That gleam through wastes of dreariness? Then the old Tempter, standing nigh, Mutters, our staggering faith to try, Go, Sinner, curse thy God and die, And leave this world of weariness! Father supreme, whose sleepless might Guides the vast planets in their flight, Who dost alternate stated night With light, and joy, and cheerfulness; Who mak'st thy verdurous grass to grow On hills, where sky-fed fountains flow, Still bringing Summer's glorious show From bleak-browed Winter's fearfulness! Thou, when such peevish thoughts intrude, Teach me to wait in mute mild mood, Till in my soul thee seemeth good To ope new founts of cheerfulness! SABBATH MORNING HYMN. (Written at Farnham, Surrey.) Fresh blows the Autumn breeze; wide waves The tawny-mantled corn; And wandering o'er far-stretching woods, The minstrel bell, With hollow swell, Proclaims the Sabbath morn. Hard-working England, hear the sound, And give thy panting heart Its weekly rest, well-earned by toil: Harsh cares dismiss, And learn what bliss God's Sabbath may impart To well-tuned souls. —Come cheerly forth From labour's grimy dens, Ye sternly striving, and behold The bright sun shine, With power divine, On the green glades and glens Of this fair Saxon land. Have time To breathe, and to employ The soul on its own wealth; unbind Your work-day mail, And blithely hail One day of thoughtful joy. Lo! where the white-smocked peasants flock To swell the morning prayer! 'Tis sweet to nurse high thoughts alone, But kindly wise, Not thou despise, The general hymn to share Of kindred human hearts. What though Their creed, mayhap, from thine Be far, one God, one heart, belongs To all the clan, Whose name is man, One common blood divine. Go thou, and join the song of love And brotherhood, and pray That pride and every prideful work Be far from us; And hallow thus Our English Sabbath-day. ODI PROFANUM VULGUS. (From Horace.) Hence ye profane, licentious throngs away! Cease from ill-omened speech, while I, this day, The Muse's priest, shall pour A song unheard before, To youths and spotless maids who own my chastened lay. Kings o'er their subject millions wield the rod; But kings of kings must quail before the god, Whose mighty arm o'erthrew The rebel Titan crew, Great Jove, who shakes sublime Olympus with his nod. This man more forest-belted roods may claim Than that; one suitor his fair plea will frame On lineage long and clear, To win the popular ear; Another on his life, and pure unspotted name Will stand; with banded clients at his gate A third shall force the votes; but soon or late What comes shall come to all; One doom to great and small Shall drop from the deep urn of still-revolving Fate. In vain Sicilian dainties goad his tongue To a forced relish, o'er whose head is hung The sword by one thin hair; In vain the birds prepare Sweet-warbled songs for him; in vain soft lyres are strung To invite sweet sleep. Sleep to the labouring man Comes lightly woo'd, nor scorns the narrow span That roofs the humble cot; The shade it scorneth not, Where Tempe's bosky banks the soft-winged Zephyrs fan. Seek thou enough. The man who seeks no more Nor turbid Hadria with enchafed roar Shall vex, nor, when they rise, The Kids, 'mid lowering skies, Nor when Arcturus' fall brings winter's stormy store. Nor blushing vineyards lashed with angry hail, Nor cheated hopes when fairest crops shall fail, Which or the burning star, Or watery power did mar, When mighty floods rolled down, and swept the corn clad vale. Vain pride! while with huge piers we block the main, Of straitened homes the finny fish complain; There, with his sweating bands, The master-mason stands Urging the work; with him the lord whose high disdain Scorns the dry land. But though he piles in air Tower upon tower, pale Fear shall find him there; Grim Terror shall bestride The strong-beaked trireme's pride; Behind the harnessed knight gaunt stalks the spectral Care. If then, nor Phrygian marble, nor the blaze Of purple brighter than the starry rays, Can soothe the sting of woe, Nor Persian nard, nor glow Of bright Falernian wines, where generous Bacchus sways; Why should I pile proud halls with pillars rare, And modish pomp, to court the envious stare Of foolish gazing men? Why change my Sabine glen For wealth that, got with toil, is kept with cumbrous care? BOOK III.ERATO. ??? ???? ??????? ????????, ??? ??????? ? ?? ????, ?? ??? ???? ??????. —Plato Oh Love, the song of life! Oh Love, The music of the world!— Dobell. THE BOW-WINDOW. As I came o'er from Patterdale To leafy Ambleside, 'Twas there I met the bonnie Scotch lass That soon should be my bride. She sate and looked from a bow-window, By the steepy steepy road; And down upon me, as I passed, Her queenly beauty flowed. I trudged along to Rydal mount, I came to green Grasmere, I sate beside the Poet's grave, I looked on the waters clear. But through the mount, and the mead, and the mere One sunny presence flowed, Of the maid that smiled from the bow-window At Ambleside on the road. I wandered up to lone Langdale, I clomb the lofty Fell, And the mist came down, and the storm did bray, And the floods did rudely swell. But through the mist, and the wind, and the rain, And the floods that savagely flowed, That fair face smiled from the bow-window At Ambleside on the road. I turned me back to Ambleside, I might no farther wander; I flung my guide-book in the beck, As I tracked its clear meander. And ever as I nearer came, More sweetly round me flowed That witching smile from the bow-window At Ambleside on the road. I lived a month at Ambleside, A month and nearly two, When hills were green, and streams were small, And skies were cloudless blue. And every night when the westering sun With mellowing radiance glowed, I walked not far from the bow-window At Ambleside on the road. How then from knowing liking grew, Let dainty silence cover; Till Autumn's ripening hour me found Her bosom's lord, her lover! 'Twas high in Scandale's ferny glen From her lips the sweet words flowed, That bade me share her bow-window At Ambleside on the road. And now—O Heaven!—what bliss is mine! I flung my books away, My Homer and my Sophocles, All papers grim and grey. For now I've found my nobler self, I'm nearer to man and to God, Since I live on her love in the bow-window At Ambleside on the road. MY LOVE IS LIKE A FLOWERING TREE. My love is like a flowering tree, Where strength combines with sweetness, And hard with soft doth well agree, To make one rich completeness! She's like a peach, whose soft skin fair And mellow pulp containeth The strong-ribbed, stony kernel, where The vital virtue reigneth. Meek dovelets I have known and loved, And cooed to their sweet cooing; Proud eagles, too, I wandering proved, Too high to stoop to wooing. But she is both—Eagle and Dove— And from her queenly station Now warms with summer breath of love, Now awes with admiration. By Heaven! I scarce believe the bliss That I for mine have won her, The witness of that burning kiss Which stamped my life with honour! Dear God, if she could look on me, And with her great heart love me, I'll grow more bold, and henceforth hold No post on Earth above me! LIKE TO LIKE. Love me, fair one, love me! I bring thee purest love; Thine own heart would reprove thee, Shouldst thou refuse my love. The God that rules above us, Source of life divine, Who to all good doth move us, Framed my heart for thine; Framed thy heart for mine, love; For, since creation's dawn, By force of law divine, love, Like to like is drawn. Thou seeest how the blossom, Many-hued and bright, Its beauty doth unbosom To the glowing light; How in summer weather Birds of kindred wing In leafy wood together Ope their throats, and sing. So, when with power to win me, Thy kindred beauty came, The smothered love within me Rose into a flame! Then love me, fair one, love me; And if thy tongue say, No! There is a Power above thee A wiser way will show. As step to step, where dancers Wheel measured mazes fine, So to my thought thine answers By harmony divine. For since creation's dawn, love, No other law might be, But like to like is drawn, love, As I am drawn to thee! DORA, HAST THOU EVER SEEN? Dora, hast thou ever seen How, from the sharp sheer-sided mountains, Down the slopes, so ferny green, Sundered flow the twin-born fountains? To diverse winds their course they take, As if to meet no more for ever; But oft some sudden bend they make, And mingled flow, one shining river! Dora, so my life from thine Through long, long years was diverse flowing; Twin souls were we, but law divine Had banned us from the bliss of knowing. But when His destined day came round, Whose will gives law to wind and weather, Our parted loves swift union found, And rushed like two full streams together. In an instant I was thine, And thou wert mine; no vows we plighted; Two halves by mystic law divine Were made one whole, when we united. And I no greater bliss can know From God, of all good things the Giver, Than that our mingled lives may flow In love, and truth, and joy for ever! WHEN A WANDERING ME LISTETH TO GO. When a wand'ring me listeth to go, Then lists me to wander alone, To look from an old grey crag, Or muse on an old grey stone. But, alone if me lists not to go, One only shall wander with me; And, if her fair name thou wouldst know, Thyself, lovely maiden, art she! For thou'rt a part of mine own heart, And I, when most alone, Am full of Thee, and my best thoughts Are less than half my own. When I sit on an old grey stone, And see the wild roses nod, So bright, so lucid, so pure, So fresh from the bosom of God, I look and I love them; for why? 'Tis a very small matter, a rose! But I look with a light from thine eye, And I love but thy bloom in the rose; For thou'rt a part, etc. When I sit on an old green hill, And see the fresh-bickering fountains Leap forth, and wander at will From the heart of the giant-ribbed mountains! I love the clear becks as they leap; But who will my fancy condemn, When I see thy bright thoughts ever keep A light-racing bicker with them? For thou'rt a part, etc. When I hear the blithe birds in the wood Their full-souled love-ditties indite, Making Heaven of green solitude, And thrilling sweet June with delight; Think I, all the Muses could never Invent fitter measures for me; For such are the ditties that ever My heart-strings are harping to thee! For thou'rt a part, etc. Then, maid, if thee listeth to go, Me listeth with thee, or alone, To look from an old grey crag, Or to muse on an old grey stone. But if thou don't love solitudes, Then work here at home like a bee, While I go and bring from the woods A bundle of songs made for thee! For thou'rt a part of mine own heart, And I, when most alone, Am full of Thee, and my best thoughts Are less than half my own! LOVELY DORA, HAST THOU SEEN? Lovely Dora, hast thou seen In the land of high-piled mountains, When in the night a storm hath been, A sudden gush of roaring fountains? Down the gorge, all foaming white, The rain-god leaps with rattling quiver, The rill becomes a beck of might, The beck becomes a rolling river. Dora, so my life did creep In the narrow groove of duty, Till thou didst come with queenly sweep, And touched me with the power of beauty. O then my soul gushed out with might, A tide of buoyant joy upbore me! All my thoughts were summer bright, All my words were song before thee! Lovely Dora, thou art gone, But dwells with me thy beauteous presence; Lives the seed which thou hast sown, Germs the thought of joy and pleasance. For I know thou art not far, And the thought of thy great beauty Turns to music every jar, In the dull refrain of duty! LET ME LOOK INTO THINE EYE! Let me look into thine eye, Through thine eye into thy soul, Draw the curtain from the sky, Where the living pictures roll! I am weary of smooth faces, Looks that play a pretty part, Shallow smiles and gay grimaces; Show me, show me, maid, thy heart! When in gay saloon I found thee Sailing proudly, like a queen, With an host of fops around thee, Through the fair and flaunting scene; Sure, I thought, this stately maiden Struts her hour with dainty art, But behind this masquerading Keeps, I'll swear, a guileless heart. Let me look into thine eye, Through thine eye into thy soul, Of deep thoughts and fancies high The living-ciphered book unroll! I am sick of polished faces, Smiles tricked out for fashion's mart; Worth a thousand practised graces, Show me, show me, maid, thy heart! O BLESSED ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE! O blessed atmosphere of Love, Thee now I fairly, fully prove! For not the balmy spring More sweet through bursting herb and tree Breathes genial-pulsing energy, Than me thy fragrant wing Fans constant; O the sweet repose From iron toils and thorny woes On gentle woman's breast! I will unmail me here. Go, boy, And make my sword a tinkling toy, And with my haughty crest Brush flies from pleasure's cheek! I will The stony-faced and Stoic skill To look on blood forbear. Here, on sweet woman's gentle breast, Be every sterner sin confessed, Thawed every frosty care! MY FANNY O! Air—“The Lass in yon Town.” O wat ye wha's in yon house, Yon stern and stately palace O? A forest flower's in yon house, Fresh frae the mountain valleys O! The city dames are nice and prim, Tight tied with laces many O; But she with love doth freely brim, And thinks nae harm, my Fanny O! O wat ye wha's in yon big house, And gars my rhymes sae jingle O? A lass—O would I had her crouse The queen of my blithe ingle O! O wat ye wha's in yon house, Yon proud and lordly palace O? Wha would expect in yon house The bloom o' mountain valleys O? Though fairer features I ha'e seen, And forms more slender many O; Yet twa sic frank and friendly een I only found in Fanny O! The learned may mark the lines of art, Split nice distinctions many O; But gi'e thou me the truthful heart, The open eye of Fanny O! Where Beaumont water glides wi' glee Frae Cheviot green and grassy O, There might I wander free wi' thee, My blithe, true-hearted lassie O! O shun the arts of city dames! Nae prickly fashion dress thee O! O sport not thou with fickle flames, Nae fopling false caress thee O! O shun the taint of pride and pelf, And, 'mid thy lovers many O, Choose him who loves the simple self Of fresh, free-hearted Fanny O! FANNY MACMURDOCH. Fanny MacMurdoch is blithe and bonnie, Fanny MacMurdoch is frank and free; God bless thee ever, Fanny MacMurdoch, Soothly thou art a joy to see! Fanny MacMurdoch, Fanny MacMurdoch, Blithe and blooming Fanny MacMurdoch! My heart was glad, and my heart was sad, When first I looked on Fanny MacMurdoch. Fanny MacMurdoch is truthful-hearted, Truth she wears in her bonnie blue e'e: Souls of children, where thou comest, Fanny MacMurdoch, come with thee! Fanny MacMurdoch, Fanny MacMurdoch, Truthful-hearted Fanny MacMurdoch! One look I gave, one look I got, And I lost my heart to Fanny MacMurdoch! O Fanny MacMurdoch, Fanny MacMurdoch, A wicked thought thou gav'st to me; I wish I were married twenty times over To thee, and all that's like to thee! O Fanny MacMurdoch, Fanny MacMurdoch, Blithe, brave-hearted Fanny MacMurdoch, I'm married already (and can't be divorced) In heart to thee, sweet Fanny MacMurdoch! O STANEHIVE IS A BONNIE, BONNIE TOUN! O Stanehive is a bonnie, bonnie toun, From its quiet bay bright peeping; 'Twixt the rocks sae hard and bare, Like a little Eden sleeping. There aince lived a bonnie, bonnie lass, And worthy was the man wha got her; She was like the bonnie toun, He the rocks of strong Dunottar. She was mine by rights—ae night In the starry clear December, She did press my hand sae warm, Looked sae kindly, I remember. But for want of needfu' cash, I was blate to tell my story; And see I lost my bonnie lass, And anither cam' afore me. Truth, she had a laughing e'e, And her mou' was made for kissing; Light her step, and when she spak' Ilka word did seem a blessing. O she was a bonnie, bonnie lass, Worthy was the man wha got her; Ne'er without a tear I pass Sweet Stanehive and strong Dunottar! LOVE'S LULLABY. Ye waters, wildly pouring, With hollow murmurs roaring, Plunging o'er the rocky steep With a furious foamy sweep, In the cavern'd caldron boiling, Turning, tumbling, twisting, toiling, Sounding from the glen's dark throat Old hymns of deep and drowsy note; Ye waters, hollow-roaring, Lull ye, lull my love asleep! Ye forests, dark-surrounding, With hollow whispers sounding, Breath that stirs the horrid woods, Voice of vasty solitudes, Like the sea, with murmurs swelling, Solemn, sacred, awe-compelling, Speaking to the pious ear Like God's guardian presence near; Ye forests, hollow-sounding, Lull ye, lull my love asleep! INVITATION. Not by Leman's lovely lake, Or Italy far away, Where the jocund Sun doth make Perpetual holiday; Not in fair and festal Rome, Or where Venice airy Piles the palace and the dome On her waters fairy; On my own, my Scottish braes, Where the tall pine darkly sways, O'er the fresh and purple heather Green-bedappled with the fern, Fondly, while we stray together, I will teach, if thou wilt learn, To love, sweet maid, to love! Freshly blows the Autumn breeze High over Clach-na-Ben, Fragrant wave the birchen trees At Dye-brig, low in the glen. There, if thou with me wilt stray, Bird in April weather Never was merrier on the spray Than we shall be together. Yes, fair maiden, thou wilt go! Such sweet silence ne'er meant NO. Thus my faithful fancy guesses These bright eyes might ne'er look stern, And who owns these golden tresses, She can teach, as well as learn, To love, sweet maid, to love! WHEREFORE NOW NOR SONG NOR SONNET? Wherefore now nor song nor sonnet Write I thee, Eliza dear? Love's a plant, the blossom on it Rhyme, child of the vernal year: With the full-grown time it ceases, Waning as the fruit increases, Therefore now nor song nor sonnet Write I thee, Eliza dear! Ever as I would be chiming Pretty pointed lines to thee, Seems a power to rein my rhyming, And it reasons thus with me: “Fool, why wilt thou still be prating? Truth that's known needs no debating!” Therefore I nor song nor sonnet Write, Eliza dear, to thee! I'VE MADE A COVENANT WITH MINE EYES. I've made a covenant with mine eyes To meet no more thy glances; Run he whose hand may seize the prize, Whose speed bright Hope enhances! But me—I'm sold to stern employ; I've sworn an oath to Duty, A soldier's oath; and dare not toy With tangling nets of Beauty! I've looked on thee too long!—thou hast A witching spell about thee; But God hath made me free at last; Now I can live without thee! Let every smooth, soft-bearded boy That flits on wings of leisure, Taste from thy smiles love's dainty joy! My work shall be my pleasure. Then fare thee well!—to grave and gay Dispense thy charmèd chalice; Spread harmless pleasures without pay, Sow sweet harm without malice! But I, whom thou hadst wounded sore, The pleasing-painful arrow Out from my quivering flesh I tore, And now am healed from sorrow! SPORT NOT WITH LOVE! Sport not with love, if thou art wise; Quick from such perilous pastime turn thee! The light that rays from beauty's eyes Shall grow into a flame to burn thee! If the fair maid may not be thine, In feeding love thou feedest sorrow; One short hour's bliss may make thee pine With a life-long wound to-morrow! 'Tis hard, I know, 'tis harsh; but take The friendly warning that I bring thee: This singing bird will turn a snake, And in thy bosom sorely sting thee! When the ripe peaches on the wall Are hung too high for thy endeavour, Even now thy lawless gaze recall, Or pine with fruitless greed for ever! Sport not with love, if thou art wise; Sport not with love!—a spark is pretty; But give it breath, and lo! it flies Rampant abroad, and flames a city! If the fair maid may not be thine, From love's luxurious pasture turn thee, Or these fair eyes that beam benign Shall grow a scorching flame to burn thee! JANET. I know a lass I will not name, For in this evil planet A thousand tongues my praise would blame, So I'll just call her Janet. A lass of such fine witching grace, That, but my sails are furled, I'd chase her at a rattling pace For love o'er half the world; This dainty Janet! Hast seen the swan, whose plumes avail For smoothest luxury's pillow, That sails and scarcely seems to sail Full-bosomed o'er the billow; So graceful she, so stately mild, So queenly, so majestic, Yet sportive as a very child, With kindly thoughts domestic, This rare young Janet! Thou know'st the yellow furze in May, Its odorous richness flinging Far o'er brown heath and grassy brae, When cuckoo's note is ringing; So rich in golden gleams is she, Such fragrance floateth from her, It makes me happy as a bee Drunk with the breath of Summer To look on Janet! Thou know'st the pure, pellucid lake, The mountain stream's fair daughter, Where tree and tower their image make In the soft-cradling water; So clear, so soft, fair Janet's eye Her heart's pure depth discloses, While eloquent smiles around her fly, Like hues from bursting roses, So true is Janet! Nor only true, but seeks for truth With careful, nice endeavour, And to this service yields her youth, With every gift God gave her. With the strong arms of love she clings To all Earth's living creatures, And worships in the meanest things The trace of God's own features, This high-souled Janet! Nor knows alone, but liberal throws The seeds of truth diffusive, And with sweet breath away she blows Each filmy mist delusive. O what a grace has truth, when she And such as she are preachers! To spurn God's law may guiltless be From harsh and thorny teachers, But not from Janet! The Earth is full of lovely things; Within this teeming planet To each a separate pleasure springs, But my delight is Janet. To ken a star, or gauge a storm, Some men will mountains move, But in my heart the blood grows warm When I behold and love This rare dear Janet! DINNA MIND MY GREY HAIRS. Dinna mind my grey hairs, Bonnie, bonnie lady! My heart is warm and glowing, My hand is sure and steady. But if you'll be mine ain wife, My heart's delight, my joy, You'll find the man with grey hairs A young and lusty boy. Dinna mind my grey hairs, Bonnie, bonnie lady! Like a goat or antelope I can climb a mountain; From my brain thoughts bright with hope Leap as from a fountain. I can foot it in a reel As light as finch or sparrow, And often in my heart I feel Sweet stings from Cupid's arrow. Dinna mind my grey hairs, Bonnie, bonnie lady! Dinna mind my grey hairs, Bonnie, bonnie lady! My blood is coursing freely, My wit is quick and ready. And if you let me circle you In love's enraptured arms, You'll find no youth of twenty-two More worthy of your charms. Take me with my grey hairs, Bonnie, bonnie lady! JENNY'S SOLILOQUY. O that my braw wooers would study their battle, A face of more meekness belike I might show them! But now they rush on with a reasonless rattle, And forget that before we can love we must know them. These hot-bloods, they think that we women are pikes, To devour a red rag, or a leaf of white metal; But a sensible maiden will look ere she likes, As a bee smells the flower in the breeze ere it settle. There's huge-whiskered Harry came swashing from town, On a pair of stout legs that full bravely did carry him; He thought a red coat with the fair must go down, So that very night he besought me to marry him. Quoth I, I can't tell, you might do very well, You have whiskers and legs, and your brave name is Harry, But my husband must know me, and Harry must show me His soul, if he has one, before I can marry! Then Tommy the student, a smooth-polished man, Who soon on his shoulders a surplice will carry, He thought a good wife should be part of his plan, So fresh from his Greek books he asked me to marry. Quoth I, you look sleek, and you're well read in Greek, And a logical thrust you can decently parry; But whether your soul's a man's or a mole's I must know, learnèd Tommy, before I can marry! Next, barrister Bobby came flouncing about, As keen as a hawk that will pounce on the quarry; He thought I must read my Lord Bob on his snout, So he said a few smart things, and asked me to marry. Quoth I, that you're clever no man doubted ever, With you for an answer no question needs tarry; But if you claim a part, learnèd sir, in my heart, You must show me your own first, then ask me to marry! And so they go bouncing and blundering on, The metal before it is hot always striking; And thus in the end I'll be left quite alone, Where no fancy has leisure to grow to a liking. But of one thing I'm sure, no mate I'll endure, Who thinks I can wed his mere beef and his bone; But he who would win me must first reign within me, By the right of a soul, the born lord of my own! THE BROWN GOWN. Jenny, what's this? There's something amiss About you to-day, though I can't tell what; 'Tis not in the grace Of your arch-smiling face, Nor yet in the beautiful bend of your hat. Yes! now I perceive, you who used to be drest, Like glorious June in her Sunday vest, Have doffed your colours, and donned a gown Of a muddy and meaningless snuffy old brown; C'est une grande bétise, ma chèere! Tell me, did you ever By lake or by river See brown primroses prinking the grass? And wouldn't it be silly, If rose or lily Were blooming in brown, when the meadow you pass? There are flowers of purple, and blue, and gold, And green is the carpet that covers the mould; But brown is no blossom, and why should you, The fairest of flowers, wear so dingy a hue? C'est une grande bétise, ma chèere! For brown is a colour No hue can be duller; Brown are green leaves when their glory is fled, The cold grey stone Calls the brown moss its own, And brown is the dust which we fling on the dead. Brown are the tadpoles in muddy abodes, Earwigs and beetles, and adders and toads; But that a fair maid should envelope her charms In brown, like a Venus in Pluto's grim arms, C'est une grande bétise, ma chèere! Then, Jenny, be wise, And don't vex my eyes With a gown of this muddy and meaningless hue; I'd as soon see Apollo Ride Heaven's blue hollow, Like a Capuchin monk, or an Old Clothes Jew. Put on the bright robe, the delight of young Cupid, When you look so clever, and men look so stupid; For not even you for a Grace will go down, When swathed in wide volumes of snuffy old brown. Laissez donc cette bétise, ma chèere! WHO'S THERE, JANET? Who's there, Janet? —Come and see! Come to the window, and peep with me! Look from the window, my dainty fair, I'll show you a sight that's somewhat rare. What you sought, since first you began To be a woman, I'll show you— a man; A man complete in body and soul, With every part that builds up a whole. There he stands, and leans on the wall, So firm, so strong, so noble, so tall. He looks on the village; he's rapt in the view— Or thinking, it may be, on something like you. Mark him, Jenny, and measure him well! Who knows what may yet be true? He's a perfect man, every inch of the ell, And made perhaps, just made for you! None of your perking, critical fops, Who go sniffling about the booksellers' shops, Smelling each work before publication, That they may give an account to the nation. Fellows who write in the weekly Reviews, With all men for their theme, and themselves for their Muse, Swaying with large, unfettered dominion The rambling realms of babbled opinion, Hanging this sign from the tip of their nose: “Ready to meet whate'er you propose In the shape of a YES with a legion of NOES!” Men so clever the world yet never Beheld their like, since the sophists of old Did Socrates wise to death deliver For speaking plain truth with raillery bold. Men who are ever strutting about With ready-made judgments on their snout, Who nothing in Heaven or Earth revere, But think God made all things for a sneer; On faults of their betters who daintily feed, As flies on ordure feast with greed, Thinking the readiest way for the small To grow great, is by lopping the heads of the tall, And weening they've turned—O wonderful men! The balance of fate by a snip of their pen; Forgetting that they, infallible guides, Themselves are only a straw on the tides, And, when they are wisest, direct the people, Just as the weather-cock does on the steeple! Who's there, Janet? —Come and see! Come to the window, and peep with me! Look from the window, my dainty fair, I'll show you a sight that's somewhat rare. What you sought, since first you began To be a woman, I'll show you—a man; A man complete in body and soul, With every part that builds up a whole. There he stands, and leans on the wall, So firm, so strong, so noble, so tall. He looks on the village; he's rapt in the view, Or thinking, it may be, on something like you. Mark him, Jenny, and measure him well! Who knows what may yet be true? He's a perfect man, every inch of the ell, And made, perhaps, just made for you. None of your butter-lipped clerical fops, All decently drilled in Tutorial shops Of Oxford and Cambridge, so proper and prim, With orthodox sentences crammed to the brim. Men who have eyes, but who never can look Beyond what their fathers for oracles took, But through sense and through nonsense will swear to a book. Greeklings well-furnished with learnèd quotation, To vamp an address, or patch an oration, Who lisp in elegant verse or prose What no one cares for, and every one knows, And think all common-places uncommonly clever, If them but a Greek or a Roman deliver. Men who patter their collects and creeds As glibly as Papists number their beads, Who with cross and candle, and cassock and cope, Help women and weaklings half-way to the Pope, And send a palsied old Duke or Duchess Limping to Heaven on priestly crutches; For such is the nature of man, he would fain Work out his faith, but it bothers his brain: So he hires a priest to think for him, Who prinks out a creed all decent and trim, That tickles his fancy and suits his whim; And so by this subtle device we inherit A charter of quibbles, and count it a merit. Of briars and brambles a bundle we cherish, And fret if a single prickle may perish, Till by hallowing time and long veneration Sheer nonsense becomes the sole sense of the nation. These are the men who make nonsense appear As proper as sense with logic so clear, You can't but think it a sin and a treason In matters so sacred to trust to your reason. You see the advantage of going to school, You can't but be right when you argue by rule: From erudite lips, so polite and so civil, Nought sounds in the pulpit more sweetly than drivel. Who's there, Janet? —Come and see! Come to the window, and peep with me! Look from the window, my dainty fair, I'll show you a sight that's somewhat rare; What you sought since first you began To be a woman, I'll show you—a man: A man complete in body and soul, With every part that builds up a whole. There he stands, and leans on the wall, So firm, so strong, so noble, so tall! He looks on the village; he's rapt in the view, Or thinking, it may be, on something like you. Mark him, Jenny, and measure him well! Who knows what may yet be true? He's a perfect man, every inch of the ell, And made, perhaps, just made for you! None of your moody, poetical fops, Who mingle their honey with gall and hops, Fumes of tobacco, and opiate drops. Men who think all things here out of joint, But God did to them this mission appoint, To dream broad-eyed for a day and a night, And maunder an Epos to set it all right, And beget upon clouds a new generation After their likeness, to model the nation. These are the men whose heart is broken, God knows how—but their verse is the token Who, because they do not find All things on Earth just made to their mind, Because the breeze will sometimes blow Just in their teeth, where they mean to go; Because a rose has ever a thorn, And dark clouds oft obscure the morn; Or because in a shadowless land A tree won't grow at the word of command; And an old house of course must stand, Till a new one is raised by the builder's hand; Or because a sheep must die, Before they can feast on a mutton-pie, Or because a fair girl with a jaunty bonnet Won't fetch a sigh, when they whimper a sonnet; Straightway swell with oracular rage, And blot with bile their fretful page, And in this beautiful world can see Nothing but mildew and misery; Who, when the birds in spring are singing, And all the woods with joy are ringing, Sit chiming creation's funeral knell, And say that the Earth is a seething hell, Where only devils and dunces dwell, Where a thousand fools are led by a knave, And the proudest is ever the foremost slave, Where a prize to the clown and the flunkey falls, But the Jove-born poet must sing to the walls! Who's there, Janet? —Come and see! Come to the window, and peep with me! Look from the window, my dainty fair, I'll show you a sight that's somewhat rare; What you sought since first you began To be a woman, I'll show you—a man: A man complete in body and soul, With every part that builds up a whole. Clear to see, and quick to discern, With a child-like eve ever looking to learn; With a heart where fervid oceans flow, A firm set will, and a sure-poised blow. This is a man whose wit never strands On shores forbid to human intruding, Nor wildly grasps with violent hands A mist, which he mistakes for a pudding. You'll never find him choking with books The fire within which freely glows, Nor fumbling in distant library nooks For what lies plainly before his nose. This is a man who leaves a trace, Where he plants his foot, that none may efface. He looks with wary consideration, Measures his ground, and ponders his plan; But, when he once has taken his station, Is true to his thought as a chief to his clan. This is a man whose eye discerns What each thing means in the scheme of Nature, Who wisely follows and lovingly learns, Each linked to each by the great Creator. In a star, or a tree, or a stone, He sees the secret virtue lurking; All things good he calls his own, And all rejoice to acknowledge his working. Plant him on a broad, bare hill, To-morrow the grass will there be growing! Give him a sandy waste to till, To-morrow the brook will there be flowing! Make him lord of a wildered parish, Where all the people are rude and bearish, He'll build a church, he'll build a school, And teach each workman to wield his tool. And, if you oppose him in anything good, He'll march right on with a conquering mood, Knowing that fools are fuel and food, By natural destiny made for the wise, To feed the flame of their victories. I've told you his type. What things he has done, What famous battles he hath won, Bloody and bloodless, at home and abroad, Like Paul, a fellow-worker with God, You'll hear from himself, I hope, very soon. He means to be here all the month of June; And if you and he don't come together, I am no judge of wind and weather. He was one of the first who began The close death-grapple at Inkermann; (You see the medal he worthily wears, Though many a snob that honour shares). When he came home and sheathed his sword, By an uncle's death he was made the lord Of a magnificent Highland estate, Worth some five or six thousand a-year, Where he lives on his property—strange to relate— And cares much more for the men than the deer. And now he leads the happiest life, And wants but one thing—that's a wife, Not quite unworthy of himself; For he won't marry for blood or pelf, Or ev'n for the grace—enough for many— Of a fair face without a penny; But he wants a woman whose soul gives a tone The natural concord of his own. So he told me. I said there are few Pitched on the same high key with you; But I know one who, I think, will do. And now, my dear Jenny, I've told you all. You may study him still where he leans on the wall, So firm, so strong, so noble, so tall. He looks on the village; he's rapt in the view, Or thinking, it may be, on something like you. Mark him, Jenny, and measure him well! Who knows what may yet be true? He's a perfect man, every inch of the ell, And made, I'll swear, just made for you. THE METAMORPHOSIS OF PLANTS. —This famous lyric stands single, within the compass of my reading, as a composition combining a great philosophical principle and accuracy of scientific detail with the highest poetical beauty. The measure of the original is elegiac; for which I agree with Bulwer (see his translations from Schiller) that our ballad measure of fourteen syllables is the best substitute. On Goethe's botanical philosophy, generally, the reader will consult the poet's Life, by Lewis, a work which will be long remembered as one of the great biographical masterpieces of the present age. My admiration of this poem of Goethe is so great, that I was induced to try another version of it in Latin, which the reader will find at the end of the present volume. (From the German of Goethe.) Why should it be, thou ask'st me well, so fair but to confound, This garden rich, that spreads it breadth of broidered beauty round? Names, learnèd names, thou hear'st, a host; a barbar-ous-sounding train They march, but still, as one comes in, the other leaves the brain. And yet, belovèd, 'tis one truth, not complex, not profound, One sacred simple truth, that rules this maze of tangled sound: The ever-varying flowery forms, their thousands are but one; There is a law that's like in all, but quite the same in none. O! my heart's chosen, if the thought that subtly stirs the brain, Can teach the tongue, I'll tell thee now this law, nor tell in vain. Behold the plant, by what nice rule, from the dark groping root Step after step it mounts the scale to blossom bright and fruit. Behold the seed, the little seed, with silent plastic might, How nurturing Earth the case unfolds, and to the genial light, The ever-moving holy light, the delicate frame commends, The slight, thin, leafy frame, that soon to gorgeous height ascends. Simple the power slept in the seed; a nascent type is there Of all that shall be, nicely wrapt, and swathed with curious care; Half-formed and colourless, root and stem, leaflet and leaf there slept, Their charmed life all safe from harm by the arid kernel kept, Till gentle dews and genial rain forth-draw the swell-ing might, That shoots elastic from its bed of circumambient night. But simple still the primal shoot; as in the boy the man, Here lies of the full tree immense, the unexpanded plan. But mark, anon an impulse new, knot tower'd on knot behold! And still as higher mounts the stalk, the primal type unrolled Repeats itself; like, not the same; for in the leafy show The upper floats with ampler pride than that which grew below. More deeply cut, and cleft, and carved, and fringed in various trim, The parts dispread, once closely-twined in the inferior limb. Thus step by step the growth proceeds, till perfect on the view It bursts, a wonder ever old, a wonder ever new; So giant-ribbed, so straggling free, in swelling breadth dilated, As Nature's self were weak to check the impulse she created. But she is wise; and reining here the pride o' the leafy veins, Gently prepares the higher change, where perfect beauty reigns; In narrower cells with milder pulse and calmer flow she lingers, And soon the delicate frame displays the working of her fingers. Back from the broad and leafy fringe the keen pulsa-tion flows, And buoyant now the topmost stem more light and graceful grows; Leafless the tender stalklet's grace shoots eagerly on high, And soon a shape of wonder bursts, and fills the studious eye. Leaflet with leaflet trimly paired, the counted, the untold, Rise, and, with nice adjustment ranged, their spread-ing wings unfold. The parted cup unbinds its charge, and free in sunny ray The million-coloured crowns aloft their blushing wealth display. Thus Nature triumphs in her work, and in full glory shows Each step i' the measured scale, through which to such fair height she rose; And wonder still detains the eye, oft as the breeze stirred blossom, On delicate stalklet perched sublime, nods o'er the leafy bosom. But not this gorgeous wealth remains: the strong creative power Lives in the core; the hand divine stirreth the conscious flower, And lo! with inward-curling force, each fine and slender thread Elastic springs to find its mate, and with its like to wed: And now they meet, the lovely pairs, and by a law divine, In nuptial rings they stand around the consecrated shrine, While Hymen hovers near, and wanton breezes odorous blow, And clouds of genial dust forth roll, and vital fountains flow. Asunder now, and cased apart, stands every swelling germ, Soft-bosomed in the pulpy fruit, that shields its growth from harm; And Nature here the circle ends of her eternal working, But still within the old the seed of a new life is lurking. Link unto link she adds; that thus, as countless ages roll, Part after part may share the pulse that stirs the mighty whole. Look now, belovèd, on this web of broidered beauty round, And feel it ne'er was woven thus so fair but to confound. Each leafy plant thou see'st declares the never changing laws, And every flower, loud and more loud, proclaims the Eternal Cause. Nor here alone: once recognised the Godhead's mystic trace, Thou'lt see through each most strange disguise the now familiar face; In creeping grub, in wingèd moth, in various man thou'lt know The one great soul that breathes beneath the curious-shifting show. Bethink thee, then, how, in the hours that first together drew Our hearts, from light acquaintance' germ familiar converse grew, From converse sweet by gentle change how potent friendship rose, Till perfect love within our breasts both flower and fruitage shows. And this, bethink, what woven web of blest emotions grew, Phase after phase of various love, the same but ever new! And learn to enjoy the hour! pure love still upward strives to float To that high sphere where wish to wish, and thought responds to thought, Where feeling blent with feeling, raptures thrilled with raptures rare, In bonds of a diviner life, unite the blissful pair. BOOK IV.EUTERPE. The Muse, nae poet ever fand her, Till by himsel' he learned to wander, Adown some trotting burn's meander, And no think lang; O sweet to stray, and pensive ponder The heart-felt sang! — Burns. Le bon Dieu me dit, chante, Chante, pauvre petit! — Beranger. MY VOCATION. Through life I went blundering on, Trying this thing and that for employ; But of trades and professions was none Would suit such a cross-witted boy. One day, when I strayed through the wood, All dark and despairing of good, I heard a sweet bird on the spray, And thus it seemed chirping to say— “Why don't you try to sing, sing, Cheerily, cheerily, poor little thing?” Of theology, warranted sound, I made a devout navigation, But the bigots soon ran me aground, With sulphurous blasts of damnation. Besides, I soon found that God's plan Was too vast for the small wit of man; So I took the sweet hint from the spray, And my heart with the bird 'gan to say— “Love man and his Maker, and sing, sing, Piously, piously, poor little thing!” I served with a lawyer some time, And I used the lithe trick of the jaw, But to me all their speeches sublime Seemed very like thrashing of straw. With words very deftly they wrangled, But the sense in the scuffle was strangled; So I went to the bird on the spray, And my heart with its song seemed to say— “Leave wrangling and jangling, and sing, sing, Peacefully, peacefully, poor little thing!” To combat the worst of our foes, With the Doctors I then did embark; The disease they were quick to expose, But the cure was to guess in the dark. So, being no friend of humbug, I threw away lancet and drug; And I went to the bird on the spray, And my heart with its song seemed to say— “The best of all cures is to sing, sing, Hopefully, hopefully, poor little thing!” And now I'm a minstrel by trade, And though I don't gather much money, Since the time when that bird I obeyed, My heart is a flower full of honey. From grim theological doctors, From lawyers and drug-concoctors, I'm free as a bird on the spray; And a voice in my heart still doth say— “Thy wisdom below is to sing, sing, Fearlessly, fearlessly, poor little thing!” MY WISH: AN IDYLL. “Tell me thy wish!”—Though wishes are foolish, yet sometimes a friend may Speak to a friend the thought, that in the back ground of his fancy Floats serenely, remote from the urgent spur of the moment. When my battle is fought—for I would live as a soldier, Gallantly shaping my life to the type of a noble con-ception, Fighting with faithless hearts, and brains of no specu-lation, Meagre formalists, men who swear by statute and parchment, Clogging with blocks from the past the glorious march of the future:— But when my Malakoff falls—or I am maimed in the storming— Then I know the spot, where I would build me a cot-tage, Neat and trim, with lancet-windows quaint, and a bulging Bow to the West, a porch to the South with stiff old ivy Roofed, and flanked on each side by a trellised veran-dah, bound with Roses and Traveller's Joy. Remote it lies in a mea-dow, Where the river, the son of the mountain, before with the briny Billow he mingles, around the base of the wooded enclosure Rushes with circular sweep, and leaves a plain in the middle. Silently then he gathers his strength, and sombrely winding Through a deep, dark chasm, is lost in the eddies of ocean. Here my cottage shall stand; and here, before my window, Densely massed shall the sycamore spread its bountiful shadow Over the daisied green, where the mill-stream winding clearly Circles me round with peace, and the twin-spired hoary cathedral Peeps through the trees. Here I, with my wife, my faithful companion, Lovingly quick to my faults, and jealously keen for my honour, Wisely would cherish the years that ripen the spirit for glory. Here, with a bevy of bright-eyed boys—my own or my sister's— I in the morning will rise, and sow the peas in the garden, Trim the hedges, or bind the rasps, or dig the potatoes. Here, in the heat of the day, my leisure shall know me, my study, Painted with dancing Graces, Mercuries, Pans, and Apollos, Shelved with books, and piled with papers of youthful remembrance. O! the luxury then to take my Foulis' Homer, Gift of Forbes, my friend, and spread before me its ample Large-typed beautiful page, and spout the wrath of Achilles Loud with rhythmical chaunt, as often in youthful fervour I, on the breezy brow of Morven or mighty Muicdhui, Shouted my Greek to the winds! or, should my humour be thoughtful, Then in my ear shall sound the melodious wisdom of Plato, Deep-mouthed, voicing the things that remain, when the pride of the Present Passes, and God is felt, the centre of deathless Being: Or, if the comical whim shall tickle my diaphragm, lightly Thou, Aristophanes then, with lusty humour redundant, Shaking thy blossoms of wit, like flowers in summer, shalt cheer me. Thus I'll muse o'er my books, till the slanting beam in the window Shows the sun half-way from his noon-day height to his setting. Then my faithful companion, my wife, with loving inquiry, Taps at my door, and a bevy of bright-eyed boys up-roarious Rushes behind. Abroad we sally, and carelessly wander Over the fields, or across the deep stream paddle the wherry: Many a flower we pluck, and many a fern from the shaded Root of the old grey crag, and with learned phrase botanical Daisy and crow-foot baptize, and the crimp-leaved blue-flowered speedwell; Stamens and pistils we count, and talk of loves and marriages Mystical-typed by God in the life of the leafy creation. Then my faithful companion, my wife, with thoughts of affection, Thinks of the poor and the sick. We visit the old schoolmaster, Call on the gardener's widow, and talk of her son, who so bravely Scaled the heights, and spiked the guns at glorious Alma; Leave a book for Tommy, the learned son of the ploughman, Who, his mother hath said, shall mount the pulpit, and, one day, Stir the hearts of the people, and thunder, as Guthrie thunders. Thus we roam till the westering sun with lengthening shadow Falls; and then return to the sound of the gong for dinner. Now to dinner we go—my dinner shall never be lonely— Me the minister, clerk of the Church by law established, Me the Dissenter shall know; one liberal board receives them. Hock and Claret shall whelm the sectarian hate in their bosoms, Drowned in mellow delight. Likewise the village physician I to my table will call, and every man whom the parish Honours, for virtue, or knowledge, or public spirit reputed. We with various talk will season the generous flowing Soul-discumbering wine—the battles of Tory and Whig men, Church and State, the Russian's wile, and the Prussian's weakness, Freedom down-trampled in France, and Popery nursled in Oxford: Science, religion, and art, theology, heresy, schism, Records of God in the rock, huge antediluvian reptiles, Mummied in beds of stone, with fishes and crabs gigantic; Maurice, and Lewis, and Kingsley, Macleod the jocund apostle, Thackeray, Dickens, and Browning, and Carlyle, king of the Titans; Hamilton, Hegel, and Kant, the Infinite and the Insoluble, Harsh-grained bigots at home, and cloud-brained mystics in Deutschland. Thus shall flow the discourse: the gentlemen then to the parlour Ripely retire; and there, with the clatter of saucers and tea-cups, Rattling dice, and thoughtful chess, and whist fourhanded, Critical talk with the ladies of Tennyson's Idylls and Balder, Adam Bede, and Miss Muloch, Macaulay, Massey, and Aytoun, Sermons at home and abroad, the fiery bray of the unkempt Gospelling Scot, and the smooth-lipped polish of gentleman priests, who Guide with innocuous grace the Cockney's silken devotions, Lightly the hour we beguile. Or, if the Squire's son, the lieutenant, Fresh from India, gaping about for a wife and a fortune, Deigns to know my roof, then he with the Doctor's daughter Lightly shall wheel the graceful waltz, or through the mettlesome Reel shall merrily tramp. Or Mary, the sunny-faced maiden, Eldest born of the Free Church minister, beautiful Mary, She at the landlord's call shall warble an old Scotch ballad, Banks o' Doon, or Auld Langsyne, or Wandering Willie; Or with a graver Muse shall lift the note of devotion, Angels bright and fair, thy jubilant pæan, St Asaph, Luther's hymn, or the prayer that Kœrner prayed in the battle. Then my faithful companion, my wife, with godly remembrance, Goes to the minister, clerk to the Church by law established, Whispers a word, and brings from the shelf the big old Bible. He unclaspeth the book, and gravely readeth a chapter, Weighty with wisdom of love, and consolation, and warning. Then he bendeth his knee, and prays to the mighty Creator; We with him give thanks to the bountiful Giver of all things, Gratefully reckon the joys of the day, and with pious assurance Find in the fruits of the Past the germ that pledges the Future. Here thou hast it, my friend: the wish of my heart is spoken; Wish not uttered before, and scarcely thought: for, believe me, Wishes belong not to man, but what God sends with a manly Courage to welcome, and firmly to grasp the good of the moment. THE WEE HERD LADDIE. —The hero of this little descriptive song is Sir Andrew Halliday, a native of Annandale, to the poetical aspect of whose character I was introduced by Dr Carlyle, when hospitably entertained by him in his snug little cell near Ecclefechan. About Sir Andrew's youth, see particularly “Poems by John Johnstone. Edinburgh, 1857;” a little work containing some interesting notices of Scottish peasant life, in the latter half of the last century. Little Andrew, lively Andrew, Herding of the kine, Looking 'neath thy curly locks Wi' bright and merry eyne! Stretched upon a furzy brae, Wi' bonnet, plaid, and crook, What should a wee herd laddie do Wi' a Greek and Latin book? There's mony a thought in Andrew's head; His fancy freely wanders North and South, and East and West, And still he reads and ponders. There's something brewing in his brain; Beneath his plain grey plaidie, Adventures beat in every vein O' the wee bare-footed laddie. And what's become of Andrew now? I hear he's gone to college; He saved a penny in the hills, To pay his fees of knowledge. And Andrew now is Doctor hight, And now the leech is gone, To serve their need who bravely bleed In Spain with Wellington. And Andrew's now a man of proof. At sacred Duty's call Brave Andrew never stands aloof; On him hang great and small. And now he's come from Waterloo, Wi' the Duke that ruled the wars, And they, who know his service true, Have gemmed his breast wi' stars. And now he's grown a belted knight, The wee bare-footed laddie, Wi' heart as pure and eye as bright As when he wore the plaidie. The mightiest Duke in a' the land Who scorns a wee herd laddie, Now shakes “Sir Andrew” by the hand— The knight that wore the plaidie! THE OLD SOLDIER OF THE GARELOCH HEAD. I've wander'd east and west, And a soldier I hae been; The scars upon my breast Tell the wars that I have seen. But now I'm old and worn, And my locks are thinly spread, And I'm come to die in peace, By the Gareloch Head. When I was young and strong, Oft a wandering I would go, By the rough shores of Loch Long, Up to lone Glencroe. But now I'm fain to rest, And my resting-place I've made, On the green and gentle bosom Of the Gareloch Head. 'Twas here my Jeanie grew, Like a lamb amid the flocks, With her eyes of bonnie blue, And her gowden locks. And here we often met, When with lightsome foot we sped, O'er the green and grassy knolls, At the Gareloch Head. 'Twas here she pined and died— O! the salt tear in my e'e Forbids my heart to hide What Jeanie was to me! 'Twas here my Jeanie died, And they scoop'd her lowly bed, 'Neath the green and grassy turf, At the Gareloch Head. Like a leaf in leafy June, From the leafy forest torn, She fell; and I'll fall soon, Like a sheaf of yellow corn. For I'm sere and weary now, And I soon shall make my bed With my Jeanie, 'neath the turf At the Gareloch Head. MAY SONG. O'er the brown heath far, by the steep red scaur, Where the yellow furze bloom is glowing; When the keen cold East, and the North hath ceased, And the soft-winged South is blowing; Away! away! away! Where bright shines the May, And the fields are green with growing! Where the dark old pine, in the bright sunshine, Its fresh green tips is trimming; Where the light feathered throng, with the airy song Of full-throated glee are brimming; Away! away! away! The lusty May Let us with them be hymning! Where the bright blue sky, on the pinnacle high Of dark Lochnagar, rests clearly; Where snows no more wreathe the frontlets hoar Of bleak Ben-Awn Written as pronounced, but properly spelled Avon. so drearly; Away! away! away! Hymn the lusty May, Where the streams are bickering cheerly! Like a ruddy-faced boy, with a vagabond joy, When the long school term is over; Like a bright-haired girl, with a light-tossed curl, When she runs to meet her lover; Away! away! away! So may the lusty May Still find me a lusty rover! POUR FORTH THE WINE. Pour forth the wine, the ruby wine! And with thine eye look into mine, Thou friend of olden days! Heap up the blazing logs! Not here On this grey ridge of granite drear, Boon April spends her flowery cheer, To wake the poet's lays. The East wind through the ungenial day Blows meagre, thin, and chill, And laggard Winter's freezing ray Gleams from the snow-patched hill. Pour forth the wine, the ruby wine! And with thine eye look into mine, Thou friend of olden days! Cheer me with love and truth: for I Oft seek in vain, beneath the sky, The true heart, from the open eye That looks with guileless gaze. A cold and caution-crusted race Here fans few joys in me; But when I see a clear, bright face, I flourish, and am free! Pour forth the wine, the ruby wine! And with thine eye look into mine, Thou friend of olden days! Speak of devotion's fiery breath, Friendship and love more strong than death, And high resolve, and manly faith, That walks in open ways. Look as thou didst long years ago, And read my heart with thine, That love and truth may freely flow, To bless the ruby wine! A SONG OF GLEN LUI BEG. With regard to the evils of the one-sided large farm system, and the wholesale expatriation of the Highlanders, I have seen no reason to change the opinions expressed by me in the Notes to my Lays and Legends, p. 360. The articles on this subject which appeared in the Edinburgh Review and elsewhere, merely played dexterously with the accidents of the question, and left the essence untouched. The impolicy of the large farm system is ad-mitted by a late practical writer, “Mackay on the Management of Landed Property in the Highlands of Scotland. Blackwood, 1858.” O the rare old pines of Glen Lui! With a shout I hailed them then, When first to the high Muichdhui I clomb, through the wild mountain glen. But where be the men that should people the glen? Where be the kilted brave Highlandmen? The men, to their king and their country true, Who stood like a wall at red Waterloo, And, with firm-rooted spears, Checked the mailed cuirassiers, When thrice to the charge, like a tempest, they flew? O where is the cot, with its smoke curling blue Through the rare old pines of Glen Lui? O the rare old pines of Glen Lui! Right blithely I greeted them then, When I whistled my way to Muichdhui, Through the folds of the green-winding glen. But where be the men that should people the glen? Woe's me for the kilted brave Highlandmen! Banished they live from their dear native shore, Beyond the Atlantic's broad billowy roar; For the Law hath a care Of a stag and a hare, And the red grouse that whirrs o'er the measureless moor; But the cottar it drives to a far foreign shore, From his home 'mid the pines of Glen Lui! AUSTRALIAN EMIGRANT'S SONG. (German Burschen Air—So nimmt ihn hin, etc.) Then fare thee well, thou land of Whig and Tory, Thou home of gold and glory, Thou famous British land, farewell! God knows the truth, I love thee well; But, since thou hast no place for me, I'll show no peevish face to thee; I'll seek a home in New South Wales. The world is wide: Hope is a gallant rider; God is a good provider: Faith's portion he appointeth sure. Farewell, my Scottish mount and moor! Where summer smiles more cheerily, Nor winter frowns so drearily; I'll find a home in New South Wales. Farewell, dim nooks! ye dark and dingy gables! Ye ancient inky tables, Where many a peaking penman pines, Where never blessed sun-light shines! The bullock I'll be chasing now Right stoutly I'll be racing now O'er hill and dale, in New South Wales. God save thee well, thou hectic and full-blooded, With millions overflooded, Where labour ill redeems from want, And giant weeds in purple flaunt! The healthy, brawny arm alone Is king, work is the charm alone, To bind the gods, in New South Wales. God heal thy strifes, thou land of partisanship, Of narrow caste and clanship, Where Nature shrinks from Fashion's ban, And all has rights, save only Man! No close noblesse shall class me now, No haughty Church harass me now, Where life is free in New South Wales. Then fare thee well, thou land of Whig and Tory! Thou home of gold and glory! Nor gold nor glory gav'st thou me; Yet not with cursing leave I thee. While here ye fight your quarrels out, My soul its free song carols out To wood and wold, in New South Wales. WORK AWAY. —The bird here referred to is one of the Caprimulgus or goatsucker tribe, well known to naturalists. Ye toiled ones who sigh for the down and the roses, While ye march to the beat of the drum, And deem that, when life's measured drudgery closes, A long taskless Sabbath shall come; I tell ye, in vain Ye sigh and complain, The disease and the cure are both whims of the brain; All things by deep labour are stirred; Work away! Work away! Work away! So cries the American bird. The flower-bulb may rest when dull Winter it beareth, But when Spring comes, and bright sunny sheen, When the many-hued flower, and ripe fruit it prepareth, It toils then unceasing, I ween. For no rest Nature knows, Where the heart warm glows, And in mystical currents the strong tide flows; With our labour our life is interred. Work away! Work away! Work away! So cries the American bird. In vain would ye break, with a fretful revulsion, The force that subdues soul to soul; Each power on the other a kindly compulsion Imposes, to perfect the whole. In his march Old Time, If you will not climb, Will leave you to gather the fruit of your crime; Whoso will not spur must be spurred. Work away! Work away! Work away! So cries the American bird. Leave ease to the idols of old Epicurus; Through danger, and doubt, and delay, To the word of the truth with strong faith we will moor us, And work, while 'tis called to-day; For God no repose In the wide world knows, But working and weaving His wise Spirit goes, And the voice of his preaching is heard, Work away! Work away! Work away! In the warning American bird. POOR CROW. As I came through the garden ground, I met a little crow, With short-clipt wing, in narrow bound, Hobbling, hobbling low. Who clipt thy wing, thou little crow? I wish that wight may die! 'Tis seemly when worms creeping go, But birds were made to fly, Poor crow! Who's like to thee?—A bard, whose thought Once spanned the welkin wide, But now he drags a heavy boat, Against life's muddy tide. Who's like to thee?—A king high-thron'd, Who ruled from sea to sea, But homeless now, an outcast thing, He creeps o'er Earth like thee, Poor crow! Then take my pity for thy plight, Thou poor misfortuned thing, And love me, while I hate the wight Who clipt thy venturous wing. So long thou hoppest on my rood, Thou hast a friend in me, And while I feed on mortal food, I'll keep a crumb for thee, Poor crow! THE CRICKET ON THE TREE. The cricket on the tree is the Latin Cicada, Italian Cicala, and the old Greek ??????. I heard it whirring away most musically in a very hot day in June, as I was wending up from the plain of Marathon, by the hill road, across to the Cephissus. It will be observed that all Greek words in ???—shortened into ?? by the modern Greeks—have the full accent on the last syllable, like our word engineer; though the Oxonians, perversely pronounce such words with the Latin accent on the antepenult. As I came up from Marathon, To high Pentelico, I heard a cricket on a tree Singing just so: Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Cricket on a tree! From morn to night, in sunny light, With mirth and jollity! Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Cricket on a tree! Burr—wurr—birr—wirr! What could more happy be? Quoth I, thou airy little thing, I much would like to know, Why from thy throat, or from thy wing, The sweet song whirreth so? Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Cricket on a tree, A merry spright, from morn to night, Thou singest pleasantly. Birry—birr—wirr, etc. Then spake to me that airy thing, Thou mortal, toiling low, Who hath not heard, both beast and bird, That man was born to woe? Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! The truth I tell to thee, I sing because I'm not a man, But a cricket on a tree! Birry—birr—wirr, etc. Quoth I, thou cricket sage and sweet, Men fret and fume, I know, But I'm a minstrel to my trade, And let contention go. Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Cricket on a tree! There's one on earth that shares thy mirth, The bard is kin to thee! Birry—birr—wirr, etc. The cricket spake—If thou art wise, Above the human rabble, I'll shelter thee, beneath my tree, From each unholy squabble. Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Poet, turn and flee From Church and State, in high debate, And find thy home with me! Birry—birr—wirr—burr—wurr! Cricket on a tree! The man is wise 'neath sunny skies Who hums a song with thee! JUMPING JANET. Rein me now thy vagrant speed, My bright-eyed girl, my sprightly Janet! I'll pen a rhyme for thee to read, Would these keen twinklers rest to scan it. Thou art airy, light, elastic, Ever moving, never stopping, With a squirrel's deft gymnastic, Ever springing, ever hopping. 'Tis well. Thou'rt nimble; so's a fly; But, for woman's proper training, Jumping Janet must apply To her wits a little reining. Nay, don't toss your head! 'tis fit, If the race you will be gaining, That your dancing blood submit, Like the generous steed's, to training. I am old and you are young, My advice you should not scoff it; Use your ears, and not your tongue, Janet, if you wish to profit. Every morning when you rise, That's my rule, my sprightly Janet, What to do before you lies, Clearly mark, and wisely plan it. Every hour its business knows, In a well-schemed day, my Janet, Like a watch that surely goes, Like a steady-wheeling planet. Map your hours, and with the clock, For the portioned work be ready; Like a limpet to a rock, Cleaving to your purpose steady. Work, as workmen work, indeed; Labour hard, and struggle stoutly, With a wisely-tempered speed, With an earnest heart devoutly. Would you know the trick to charm Pleasure from each seeming sorrow, Grasp thy task with lusty arm, Let the thing you do be thorough. And when idle fancies come— Girlish heads are full of fancies— Iridescent froth and scum, Bubble bright that gaily dances; Thoughts of things that will be soon, Handsome men, and pretty faces, Measured mountains in the moon, Ginghams, muslins, gimps, and laces; Balls and concerts, promenades, Winter wear, and summer dresses, Foppish youths, and prudish maids, Eagle eyes, and sable tresses; Horrid murders, Church and State, Metaphysics, and cosmogony, Granite slabs, and silver plate, Crimson curtains, old mahogany; Strange elopements, foolish marriages, Melting tales of love romantic, Sudden deaths, and sad miscarriages, Drownings in the deep Atlantic; Stupid sermons, pious novels, Bruits of war among the nations, Starving Celts in smoky hovels, Cumming on the Revelations: Such vain thoughts a motley train, With a gaudy gay parading, In a giddy-whirling brain, Find a place for masquerading. Such, when they shall hover nigh, Though they twinkle ne'er so brightly, Brush them from thee like a fly, Then buckle to thy work more tightly. Ban the spirits with the spell Of a pious imprecation; Ev'n as Luther banned them well, When he worked at his translation. Curb the whim, thy wit elastic To the work before thee chaining; Thou shalt know, by stern gymnastic, Thus the perfect woman's training. Hour by hour, and day by day, If thou thus shalt wisely plan it; When your work is done, you may Sport with grace, my sprightly Janet! STUDENT'S VACATION SONG. Dear Thomas, I'm told You're a student full bold, And your looks the pale reader betray, my boy! But I'm come now to call you, Ere worse shall befall you, To fling away books, and go play, my boy! A dull, plodding youth, A few grains of dry truth May pick in this marrowless way, my boy! But fresh feeling may never Flow out, like a river, From the parchment, so bloodless and grey, my boy! Think you the old bard, You are spelling so hard, Found his lusty, fresh song in this way, my boy? O no! his blithe spirit Strong joy did inherit From life, like the bird in the May, my boy! The truth must be told, You'll soon lie 'neath the mould, If you don't give your body fair play, my boy! What boots all your yearning For old Heathen learning, When you're down, with the worms, 'neath the clay, my boy! I've a house on the hill, With a loch and a rill, Where the troutlings still glancingly play, my boy! Come with me to Yarrow And fish away sorrow, Through the length of the bright summer day, my boy! THE WORKING MAN'S SONG. I am no gentleman, not I! No bowing, scraping thing! I bear my head more free and high Than titled count or king. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no, no! And only to one Lord on high My head I bow. I am no gentleman, not I! No vain and varnished thing! And from my heart without a die, My honest thoughts I fling. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no, no! Our stout John Knox was none—and why Should I be so? I am no gentleman, not I! No mincing, modish thing! In gay saloon a butterfly, Some wax-doll Miss to wing. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no, no! No moth, to sport in fashion's eye, A Bond Street beau! I am no gentleman, not I! No bully, braggart thing! With jockeys on the course to vie, With bull-dogs in the ring. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no, no! The working man might sooner die Than sink so low! I am no gentleman, not I! No star-bedizened thing! My fathers filched no dignity, By fawning to a king. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no, no! And to the wage of honesty My rank I owe! I am no gentleman, not I! No bowing, scraping thing! I bear my head more free and high Than titled count or king. I am no gentleman, not I! No, no no! And thank the blessed God on high, Who made me so! MAY SONG. On Ettrick bank the primrose grows, Where the stream is winding clearly O! Though the ash be grey, the birch is green, And the birds are chanting cheerly O! Thou weary heart, why nurse the smart Of a fruitless grief so drearily? What should thee stay, to greet the May, Like a bird on the wing, so cheerily? Cuckoo, cuckoo, far in the wood! Sweet mavis on gowany lea! O show me the trick of thy blithe May mood, And teach me to sing with thee! Blow, softly, softly breezes blow! For the wound is rankling greenly yet! And for him who is gone, whom I fear to name, The smart doth cut me keenly yet! I laid him low, when in March the snow O'er the sod was drifting drearily, And how shall I sing, like a bird on the wing, When the bright May sun shines cheerily? Cuckoo, cuckoo, far in the wood! Sweet mavis on gowany lea! I love the sweet trick of thy blithe May mood, But grief still dwells with me! APRIL SONG. (German Air.) Hark! the birds are blithely hymning! Leap, my heart! with glee be brimming! Spring light-racing, dark days chasing, Comes—God bless thee, gentle Spring! Though the ling'ring East be blowing, I can scent the power of growing. Where thou treadest, life thou spreadest; Bless thee, bless thee, gentle Spring! Poplar sprouts, the hedge is green now, Spiry larch in virgin sheen now, Gently swinging to the singing Of sweet mavis, greets the Spring. Pine upon the hoary mountain Greets thy coming; foamy fountain, With blithe bicker, quick and quicker, Ice-unshackled greets the Spring. Violet blue, the green bank sprinkling, Starry crow-flower golden twinkling, Primrose clustered, thickly muster'd Wind-flowers weave a wreath for Spring! Ha! my soul with songs is flooding! Teem glad thoughts in eager budding! Thou hast brought me wings to float me; Bless thee, bless thee, gentls Spring! TO TORQUATUS. (From Horace.) Thawed is the frost and the snow, the fields with green are fresh-coated, Green are the fresh-tufted trees; Earth is renewing her changes, the streams, with lessening waters, Gently are gliding along. Gaily the Graces come forth; with the Nymphs in harmony twining, Deftly their dances they lead. “Hope Immortality not” the year declares, and the hour speaks, Rapidly driving the day. Winter doth yield to the Spring, the Spring to Summer, the Summer Yieldeth to Autumn; and he, When he hath scattered his fruitage, retreats; and dreariest Winter Ruleth in dullness again. Thus revolving it turns;—the Moon repaireth her losses Speedily; we, when we go Down to the Shades with pious Æneas, rich Tullus, and Ancus, Dust and a shadow we are. Who can tell if the gods the sum, which to-day we have numbered, Will with to-morrow increase? Greedily what thou hast left thy heir possesses; but he, too, Quitteth how soon the bequest! Once departed, when over thy head the merciless Minos Solemnly passes his doom, Then, Torquatus, for thee shall birth, shall eloquence vainly, Vainly shall piety plead. Vainly would Dian the chaste Hippolytus free from the darkness; Chastely he sleeps with the dead. Theseus prevails not to break the bonds of Pirithous; Hades Stronger him holdeth than Love. THE GLENS OF NITHSDALE. O the bonnie, bonnie glens of Nithsdale, Where the clear rock-water flows, Where the light birch nods its fragrant plumes, And the fair green breckan grows! Glens, whose green folds were kind to hide The prophets of the hill, Then when the shepherd's arm defied The monarch's godless will. O the bonnie, bonnie glens of Nithsdale, And O the bonnie green glens! Soft o'er the hill I hear the note O' the peaceful, mild cuckoo! Not now as then, when o'er the muir Came the trooper's harsh halloo, Hunting the good and the godly men, Who preached the truth of God, Splashing with murder the bonnie green glen, And drenching with blood the sod! O the bonnie, bonnie glens o' Nithsdale, And O the bonnie green glens! O few are the houses that smoke on the hill, And the heirs of the godly are few! How rare in the glen are the sons of the men Whose hand to their heart was true! There's pride in a Duke, and there's pomp in a lord; But the glory of brave Scottish men Is the plaided cottar, who drew the sword For his faith, in the bonnie green glen! O the bonnie, bonnie glens o' Nithsdale, And O the bonnie green glens! DREAMING DAVIE. Davie was a quiet boy, Hating every boisterous joy, Slow of tongue, of temper slow, Never first a stone to throw. On the moor would sit alone, Brooding on an old grey stone, Or, wandering with a drooping head, Pluck butterworts from oozy bed; Surely there is something odd, All the people say, in Davie! Dreaming Davie! dandering Davie! What's in Davie we shall see. Listless, sitting in the school Master called him dreamy fool; Flies and spiders, buzzing gnats, Rabbits, ferrets, newts, and bats, Twittering swallows, cawing rooks, All had charms for him but books; Greeks and Romans long since dead Were never meant for Davie's head. Surely there is something odd, People say, about this Davie! Dreaming Davie! dandering Davie! What's in Davie we shall see. Davie's left the school—and lo! Davie roaming now will go; Probes the nooks of every glen, Scales the peaks of every Ben. In the sunshine, in the shower, Now a rock, and now a flower, Peering round with knowing eyes, Davie always finds a prize, Surely this is very odd, People say—Can this be Davie? Once so dreaming, now so scheming, Full of teeming plans is he. Davie now has wandered far, In lands beneath the burning star, Dredged the floor of every sea, Where strange finny monsters be, Crossed, by airy bamboo bridge, Clefts that part hoar Andes' ridge, Scaled Mont Blanc, and tented high On rosy snow, 'twixt Earth and sky. Surely this is very odd, People say—Can this be Davie? Daring Davie! dauntless Davie! Full of grand success is he. In the list of men who know, Europe now no name can show Like to Davie's; Earth contains Nought that's not in Davie's brains. Prince Albert and the Queen, I'm told, Hear Davie wisdom's stores unfold, Though the master in the school Called him little dreaming fool. Now men say, 'tis nothing odd He should have been a dreaming Davie! Well done, Davie! just so, Davie! Dreams beget great deeds, we see! CONFESSION OF FAITH FOR ALL MEN. What a sinful son of Adam Should believe, and how, In each heart 'tis graven, madam, Read, and know it now. 'Tis a gospel old and new, Tongues and tribes attest it true; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Nothing comes from nothing truly; God hath certainly Wisely framed and ordered duly All the things you see. Look and learn, vain babbling spare, Trace the true, and love the fair; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Satan rules the air; this wisely Doctors teach to spell, But here or there, or where precisely, Satan himself may tell. Crush the fiend that lurks within, Hydra-headed monster Sin; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Learning is not wisdom; fainly Doctors will dispute, But plies on plies the million vainly Vamp a mouldy boot. Woo the breeze, court sunny skies, Like a tree thy thought will rise; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Whoso scatters words with sorrows Sows an eager land; Wing thy speech like cunning arrows, Think with sword in hand. Watch and wait in quiet snare, Pluck, when it is ripe, the pear; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Know your ground and keep your footing, Battle not with air; When you know what thing you're shooting, Bravely do and dare. Turn the screw and drive the wedge, Every step the next will pledge; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! When you fall, remain not lying, Luck has many ways; Urge the hour, the chance be plying, Death is in delays. So Napoleon warred and won, By strong will earth's topmost son; And who denies this creed Is damned indeed! Greet the Devil when you fairly Meet him in the face! Scan him coolly o'er, and yarely He will run and race. Should he buckle for the fight, Beat him quite, or die outright; Whoso believes this creed Is saved indeed!</field>
