      <field name="fulltext">Tandem Phœbus adest, morsusque inferre parantem Congelat, et patulos, ut erant, indurat hiatus. Ovid. THE DUNCIAD: TO Dr. JONATHAN SWIFT. Remarks. The Dunciad, sic MS. It may well be disputed whether this be a right reading: Ought it not rather to be spelled Dunceiad, as the Etymology evidently demands? Dunce with an e, therefore Dunceiad with an e. That accurate and punctual Man of Letters, the Restorer of Shakespeare, constantly observes the preservation of this very Letter e, in spelling the Name of his beloved Author, and not like his common careless Editors, with the omission of one, nay sometimes of two ee's, [as Shakspear] which is utterly unpardonable. “Nor is the neglect of a Single Letter so trivial as to some it may appear; the alteration whereof in a learned language is an Atchievement that brings honour to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. Bentley will be remembered to posterity for his performances of this sort, as long as the world shall have any esteem for the remains of Menander and Philemon.” Theobald. This is surely a slip in the learned author of the foregoing note; there having been since produced by an accurate Antiquary, an Autograph of Shakspeare himself, whereby it appears that he spelled his own name without the first e. And upon this authority it was, that those most Critical Curators of his Monument in Westminster Abby erased the former wrong reading, and restored the true spelling on a new piece of old Ægyptian Granite. Nor for this only do they deserve our thanks, but for exhibiting on the same Monument the first Specimen of an Edition of an author in Marble; where (as may be seen on comparing the Tomb with the Book) in the space of five lines, two Words and a whole Verse are changed, and it is to be hoped will there stand, and outlast whatever hath been hitherto done in Paper; as for the future, our Learned Sister University (the other Eye of England) is taking care to perpetuate a Total new Shakespear, at the Clarendon press. Bentl. It is to be noted, that this great Critic also has omitted one circumstance; which is, that the Inscription with the Name of Shakspeare was intended to be placed on the Marble Scroll to which he points with his hand; instead of which it is now placed behind his back, and that Specimen of an Edition is put on the Scroll, which indeed Shakspeare hath great reason to point at. Anon. Though I have as just a value for the letter E, as any Grammarian living, and the same affection for the Name of this Poem as any Critic for that of his Author; yet cannot it induce me to agree with those who would add yet another e to it, and call it the Dunceiade; which being a French and foreign termination, is no way proper to a word entirely English, and vernacular. One e therefore in this case is right, and two e's wrong. Yet upon the whole I shall follow the Manuscript, and print it without any e at all; moved thereto by Authority (at all times, with Critics, equal, if not superior to Reason.) In which method of proceeding, I can never enough praise my good friend, the exact Mr. Tho. Hearne; who if any word occur, which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong, yet keeps he it in the Text with due reverence, and only remarks in the Margin sic MS. In like manner we shall not amend this error in the Title itself, but only note it obiter, to evince to the learned that it was not our fault, nor any effect of our ignorance or inattention. Scriblerus. This Poem was written in the year 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was published at Dublin, and reprinted at London in twelves; another at Dublin, and another at London in octavo; and three others in twelves the same year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in quarto; which was attended with Notes. Schol. Vet. It was expresly confessed in the Preface to the first edition, that this Poem was not published by the Author himself. It was printed originally in a foreign Country. And what foreign Country? Why, one notorious for blunders; where finding blanks only instead of proper names, these blunderers filled them up at their pleasure. The very Hero of the Poem hath been mistaken to this hour; so that we are obliged to open our Notes with a discovery who he really was. We learn from the former Editor, that this Piece was presented by the Hands of Sir Robert Walpole to King George II. Now the author directly tells us, his Hero is the Man ? who brings The Smithfield Muses to the ear of Kings. And it is notorious who was the person on whom this Prince conferred the honour of the Laurel. It appears as plainly from the Apostrophe to the Great in the third verse, that Tibbald could not be the person, who was never an Author in fashion, or caressed by the Great; whereas this single characteristic is sufficient to point out the true Hero; who, above all other Poets of his time, was the Peculiar Delight and Chosen Companion of the Nobility of England; and wrote, as he himself tells us, certain of his Works at the earnest Desire of Persons of Quality. Lastly, The sixth verse affords full proof; this Poet being the only one who was universally known to have had a Son so exactly like him, in his poetical, theatrical, political, and moral Capacities, that it could justly be said of him Still Dunce the second reign'd like Dunce the first. Bentl. Book the First. ARGUMENT TO Book the First. THE Proposition, the Invocation, and the Inscription. Then the Original of the great Empire of Dulness, and cause of the continuance thereof. The College of the Goddess in the City, with her private Academy for Poets in particular; the Governors of it, and the four Cardinal Virtues. Then the Poem hastes into the midst of things, presenting her, on the evening of a Lord Mayor's day, revolving the long succession of her Sons, and the glories past and to come. She fixes her eye on Bays to be the Instrument of that great Event which is the Subject of the Poem. He is described pensive among his Books, giving up the Cause, and apprehending the Period of her Empire: After debating whether to betake himself to the Church, or to Gaming, or to Party-writing, he raises an Altar of proper books, and (making first his solemn prayer and declaration) purposes thereon to sacrifice all his unsuccessful writings. As the pile is kindled, the Goddess beholding the flame from her seat, flies and puts it out by casting upon it the poem of Thulé. She forthwith reveals herself to him, transports him to her Temple, unfolds her Arts, and initiates him into her Mysteries; then announcing the death of Eusden the Poet Laureate, anoints him, carries him to Court, and proclaims him Successor. Remarks. Ver. 1. The Mighty Mother, and her Son, &amp;c.] The Reader ought here to be cautioned, that the Mother, and not the Son, is the principal Agent of this Poem: The latter of them is only chosen as her Collegue (as was anciently the custom in Rome before some great Expedition) the main action of the Poem being by no means the Coronation of the Laureate, which is performed in the very first book, but the Restoration of the Empire of Dulness in Britain, which is not accomplished 'till the last. Ibid. —her Son who brings, &amp;c.] Wonderful is the stupidity of all the former Critics and Commentators on this work! It breaks forth at the very first line. The author of the Critique prefixed to Sawney, a Poem, p. 5. hath been so dull as to explain the Man who brings, &amp;c. not of the Hero of the piece, but of our Poet himself, as if he vaunted that Kings were to be his readers; an honour which though this Poem hath had, yet knoweth he how to receive it with more modesty. We remit this Ignorant to the first lines of the Æneid, assuring him that Virgil there speaketh not of himself, but of Æneas: Arma virumque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit Littora: multum ille &amp; terris jactatus &amp; alto, &amp;c. I cite the whole three verses, that I may by the way offer a Conjectural Emendation, purely my own, upon each: First, oris should be read aris, it being, as we see Æn. ii. 513. from the altar of Jupiter Hercæus that Æneas fled as soon as he saw Priam slain. In the second line I would read flatu for fato, since it is most clear it was by Winds that he arrived at the shore of Italy. Jactatus, in the third, is surely as improperly applied to terris, as proper to alto; to say a man is tost on land, is much at one with saying he walks at sea: Risum teneatis, amici? Correct it, as I doubt not it ought to be, vexatus. Scriblerus The Mighty Mother, and her Son who brings Remarks. Ver. 2. The Smithfield Muses] Smithfield is the place where Bartholomew Fair was kept, whose shews, machines, and dramatical entertainments, formerly agreeable only to the taste of the Rabble, were, by the Hero of this poem and others of equal genius, brought to the Theatres of Covent-garden, Lincolns-inn-fields, and the Hay-market, to be the reigning pleasures of the Court and Town. This happened in the Reigns of King George I, and II. See Book 3.The Smithfield Muses to the ear of Kings, I sing. Say you, her instruments the Great! Remarks. Ver. 4. By Dulness, Jove, and Fate:] i. e. By their Judgments, their Interests, and their Inclinations.Call'd to this work by Dulness, Jove, and Fate; You by whose care, in vain decry'd and curst, Still Dunce the second reigns like Dunce the first; Say how the Goddess bade Britannia sleep, And pour'd her Spirit o'er the land and deep. In eldest time, e'er mortals writ or read, E'er Pallas issu'd from the Thund'rer's head, Dulness o'er all possess'd her ancient right, Remarks. Ver. 12. Daughter of Chaos, &amp;c.] The beauty of this whole Allegory being purely of the poetical kind, we think it not our proper business, as a Scholiast, to meddle with it: But leave it (as we shall in general all such) to the reader; remarking only, that Chaos (according to Hesiod's ????????) was the Progenitor of all the Gods. Scriblerus.Daughter of Chaos and eternal Night: Fate in their dotage this fair Ideot gave, Gross as her sire, and as her mother grave, Remarks. Ver. 15. Laborious, heavy, busy, bold, &amp;c.] I wonder the learned Scriblerus has omitted to advertise the Reader, at the opening of this Poem, that Dulness here is not to be taken contractedly for mere Stupidity, but in the enlarged sense of the word, for all Slowness of Apprehension, Shortness of Sight, or imperfect Sense of things. It includes (as we see by the Poet's own words) Labour, Industry, and some degree of Activity and Boldness: a ruling principle not inert, but turning topsy-turvy the Understanding, and inducing an Anarchy or confused State of Mind. This remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work; and without this caution he will be apt to mistake the Importance of many of the Characters, as well as of the Design of the Poet. Hence it is that some have complained he chuses too mean a subject, and imagined he employs himself, like Domitian, in killing flies; whereas those who have the true key will find he sports with nobler quarry, and embraces a larger compass; or (as one saith, on a like occasion) Will see his Work, like Jacob's ladder, rise, Its foot in dirt, its head amid the skies. Bentl.Laborious, heavy, busy, bold, and blind, Remarks. Ver. 16. She rul'd, in native Anarchy, the mind.] The native Anarchy of the mind is that state which precedes the time of Reason's assuming the rule of the Passions. But in that state, the uncontrolled violence of the Passions would soon bring things to confusion, were it not for the intervention of Dulness in this absence of Reason; who, though she cannot regulate them like Reason, yet blunts and deadens their Vigour, and, indeed, produces some of the good effects of it: Hence it is that Dulness has often the appearance of Reason. This is the only good she ever did; and the Poet takes particular care to tell it in the very introduction of his Poem. It is to be observed indeed, that this is spoken of the universal rule of Dulness in ancient days, but we may form an idea of it from her partial Government in later times.She rul'd, in native Anarchy, the mind. Remarks. Ver. 17. Still her old Empire to restore] This Restoration makes the Completion of the Poem. Vide Book 4.Still her old Empire to restore she tries, For, born a Goddess, Dulness never dies. O Thou! whatever title please thine ear, Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff, or Gulliver! Whether thou chuse Cervantes' serious air, Or laugh and shake in Rab'lais' easy chair, Remarks. Ver. 23.

Ver. 33. One Cell there is,] The cell of poor Poetry is here very properly represented as a little unendowed Hall in the neighbourhood of the Magnific College of Bedlam; and as the surest Seminary to supply those learned walls with Professors. For there cannot be a plainer indication of madness than in mens persisting to starve themselves and offend the public by scribling, Escape in Monsters, and amaze the town. when they might have benefited themselves and others in profitable and honest employments. The Qualities and Productions of the students of this private Academy are afterwards described in this first book; as are also their Actions throughout the second; by which it appears, how near allied Dulness is to Madness. This naturally prepares us for the subject of the third book, where we find them in union, and acting in conjunction to produce the Catastrophe of the fourth; a mad poetical Sibyl leading our Hero through the Regions of Vision, to animate him in the present undertaking, by a view of the past triumphs of Barbarism over Science.One Cell there is, conceal'd from vulgar eye, Remarks. Ver. 34. Poverty and Poetry] I cannot here omit a remark that will greatly endear our Author to every one, who shall attentively observe that Humanity and Candor, which every where appears in him towards those unhappy objects of the ridicule of all mankind, the bad Poets. He here imputes all scandalous rhymes, scurrilous weekly papers, base flatteries, wretched elegies, songs, and verses (even from those sung at Court to ballads in the streets) not so much to malice or servility as to Dulness; and not so much to Dulness as to Necessity. And thus, at the very commencement of his Satyr, makes an apology for all that are to be satyrized.The Cave of Poverty and Poetry. Keen, hollow winds howl thro' the bleak recess, Emblem of Music caus'd by Emptiness. Remarks. Ver. 37. Hence Bards, like Proteus] Sunt quibus in plures jus est transire figuras: Ut tibi, complexi terram maris incola, Proteu; Nunc violentus aper, nunc quem tetigisse timerent, Anguis eras, modo te faciebant cornua Taurum, Sape Lapis poteras. ? Ovid. Met. viii. Neither Palæphatus, Phurnutus, nor Heraclides give us any steddy light into the mythology of this mysterious fable. If I be not deceived in a part of learning which has so long exercised my pen, by Proteus must certainly be meant a hacknied Town scribler; and by his Transformations, the various disguises such a one assumes, to elude the pursuit of his irreconcilable enemy, the Bailiff. Proteus is represented as one bred of the mud and slime of Ægypt, the original soil of Arts and Letters: And what is a Town-scribler, but a creature made up of the excrements of luxurious Science? By the change then into a Boar is meant his character of a furious and dirty Party-writer; the Snake signifies a Libeller; and the Horns of the Bull, the Dilemmas of a Polemical Answerer. These are the three great parts he acts under; and when he has completed his circle, he sinks back again, as the last change into a Stone denotes, into his natural state of immoveable Stupidity. If I may expect thanks of the learned world for this discovery, I would by no means deprive that excellent Critic of his share, who discovered before me, that in the character of Proteus was designed Sophistam, Magum, Politicum, præsertim rebus omnibus sese accommodantem. Which in English is, A Political writer, a Libeller, and a Disputer, writing indifferently for or against every party in the State, every sect in Religion, and every character in private life.

A great Critic formerly held these clenches in such abhorrence, that he declared “he that would pun would pick a pocket.” Yet Mr. Dennis's works afford us notable examples in this kind: “Alexander Pope hath sent abroad into the world as many Bulls as his namesake Pope Alexander. —Let us take the initial and final letters of his Name, viz. A. P?E, and they give you the idea of an Ape.— Pope comes from the Latin word Popa, which signifies a little Wart; or from poppysma, because he was continually popping out squibs of wit, or rather Popysmata, or Popisms.” Dennis on Hom. and Daily Journal, June 11, 1728.Here one poor word an hundred clenches makes, Imitations.

See the Guardian, No. 40. parag. 6. See also Eusden's whole works, if to be found.

Ibid. But liv'd, in Settle's numbers, one day more.] Settle was poet to the City of London.

And Eusden eke out, &amp;c.] Laurence Eusden Poet laureate. Mr. Jacob gives a catalogue of some few only of his works, which were very numerous. Mr. Cook, in his Battle of Poets, saith of him, Eusden, a laurel'd Bard, by fortune rais'd, By very few was read, by fewer prais'd. Mr. Oldmixon, in his Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, p. 413, 414. affirms, “That of all the Galimatia's he ever met with, none comes up to some verses of this poet, which have as much of the Ridiculum and the Fustian in them as can well be jumbled together, and are of that sort of nonsense, which so perfectly confounds all ideas, that there is no distinct one left in the mind.” Farther he says of him, “That he hath prophecied his own poetry shall be sweeter than Catullus, Ovid, and Tibullus; but we have little hope of the accomplishment of it, from what he hath lately published.” Upon which Mr. Oldmixon has not spared a reflection, “That the putting the Laurel on the head of one who writ such verses, will give futurity a very lively idea of the judgment and justice of those who bestowed it.” Ibid. p. 417. But the well-known learning of that Noble Person, who was then Lord Chamberlain, might have screened him from this unmannerly reflection. Nor ought Mr. Oldmixon to complain, so long after, that the Laurel would have better become his own brows, or any others: It were more decent to acquiesce in the opinion of the Duke of Buckingham upon this matter: ? In rush'd Eusden, and cry'd, Who shall have it, But I, the true Laureate, to whom the King gave it? Apollo beg'd pardon, and granted his claim, But vow'd that 'till then he ne'er heard of his name. Session of Poets. The same plea might also serve for his successor, Mr. Cibber; and is further strengthened in the following Epigram, made on that occasion: In merry old England it once was a rule, The King had his Poet, and also his Fool: But now we're so frugal, I'd have you to know it, That Cibber can serve both for Fool and for Poet. Of Blackmore, see Book 2. Of Philips, Book 1. ver. 262. and Book 3. prope fin. Nahum Tate was Poet Laureate, a cold writer, of no invention; but sometimes translated tolerably when befriended by Mr. Dryden. In his second part of Absalom and Achitophel are above two hundred admirable lines together of that great hand, which strongly shine through the insipidity of the rest. Something parallel may be observed of another author here mentioned.And Eusden eke out Blackmore's endless line; She saw slow Philips creep like Tate's poor page, Remarks. Ver. 106. And all the mighty Mad] This is by no means to be understood literally, as if Mr. Dennis were really mad, according to the Narrative of Dr. Norris in Swift and Pope's Miscellanies, vol. 3. No—it is spoken of that Excellent and Divine Madness, so often mentioned by Plato; that poetical rage and enthusiasm, with which Mr. D. hath, in his time, been highly possessed; and of those extraordinary hints and motions whereof he himself so feelingly treats in his preface to the Rem. on Pr. Arth. [See notes on Book 2. ver. 268.] Remarks. Ver. 106. And all the mighty Mad in Dennis rage.] Mr. Theobald, in the Censor, vol. ii. N. 33. calls Mr. Dennis by the name of Furius. “The modern Furius is to be looked upon as more an object of pity, than of that which he daily provokes, laughter and contempt. Did we really know how much this poor man (I wish that reflection on poverty had been spared) “suffers by being contradicted, or, which is the same thing in effect, by hearing another praised; we should, in compassion, sometimes attend to him with a silent nod, and let him go away with the triumphs of his ill nature.—Poor Furius (again) when any of his cotemporaries are spoken well of, quitting the ground of the present dispute, steps back a thousand years to call in the succour of the Ancients. His very panegyric is spiteful, and he uses it for the same reason as some Ladies do their commendations of a dead beauty, who would never have had their good word, but that a living one happened to be mentioned in their company. His applause is not the tribute of his Heart, but the sacrifice of his Revenge,” &amp;c. Indeed his pieces against our poet are somewhat of an angry character, and as they are now scarce extant, a taste of his style may be satisfactory to the curious. “A young, squab, short gentleman, whose outward form, though it should be that of downright monkey, would not differ so much from human shape as his unthinking immaterial part does from human understanding.—He is as stupid and as venomous as a hunch-back'd toad.—A book through which folly and ignorance, those brethren so lame and impotent, do ridiculously look very big and very dull, and strut and hobble, cheek by jowl, with their arms on kimbo, being led and supported, and bully-back'd by that blind Hector, Impudence.” Reflect. on the Essay on Criticism, p. 26. 29, 30. It would be unjust not to add his reasons for this Fury, they are so strong and so coercive: “I regard him (saith he) as an Enemy, not so much to me, as to my King, to my Country, to my Religion, and to that Liberty which has been the sole felicity of my life. A vagary of Fortune, who is sometimes pleased to be frolicksome, and the epidemic Madness of the times have given him Reputation, and Reputation (as Hobbes says) is Power, and that has made him dangerous. Therefore I look on it as my duty to King George, whose faithful subject I am; to my Country, of which I have appeared a constant lover; to the Laws, under whose protection I have so long lived; and to the Liberty of my Country, more dear to me than life, of which I have now for forty years been a constant assertor, &amp;c. I look upon it as my duty, I say, to do—you shall see what—to pull the lion's skin from his little Ass, which popular error has thrown round him; and to shew that this Author, who has been lately so much in vogue, has neither sense in his thoughts, nor English in his expressions.” Dennis Rem. on Hom. Pref. p. 2. 91, &amp;c. Besides these public-spirited reasons, Mr. D. had a private one; which, by his manner of expressing it in p. 92. appears to have been equally strong. He was even in bodily fear of his life from the machinations of the said Mr. P. “The story (says he) is too long to be told, but who would be acquainted with it, may hear it from Mr. Curl, my bookseller.—However, what my reason has suggested to me, that I have with a just confidence said, in defiance of his two clandestine weapons, his Slander and his Poison.” Which last words of his book plainly discover Mr. D.'s suspicion was that of being poisoned, in like manner as Mr. Curl had been before him; of which fact see A full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge, by poison, on the body of Edmund Curl, printed in 1716, the year antecedent to that wherein these Remarks of Mr. Dennis were published. But what puts it beyond all question, is a passage in a very warm treatise, in which Mr. D. was also concerned, price two pence, called A true character of Mr. Pope and his writings, printed for S. Popping, 1716; in the tenth page whereof he is said “to have insulted people on those calamities and diseases which he himself gave them, by administring Poison to them;” and is called (p. 4.) “a lurking way-laying coward, and a stabber in the dark.” Which (with many other things most lively set forth in that piece) must have rendered him a terror, not to Mr. Dennis only, but to all christian people. For the rest; Mr. John Dennis was the son of a Sadler in London, born in 1657. He paid court to Mr. Dryden: and having obtained some correspondence with Mr. Wycherly and Mr. Congreve, he immediately obliged the public with their Letters. He made himself known to the Government by many admirable schemes and projects; which the Ministry, for reasons best known to themselves, constantly kept private. For his character, as a writer, it is given us as follows: “Mr. Dennis is excellent at Pindaric writings, perfectly regular in all his performances, and a person of sound Learning. That he is master of a great deal of Penetration and Judgment, his criticisms, (particularly on Prince Arthur) do sufficiently demonstrate.” From the same account it also appears that he writ Plays “more to get Reputation than Money.” Dennis of himself. See Giles Jacob's Lives of Dram. Poets, p. 68, 69. compared with p. 286.And all the mighty Mad in Dennis rage.

Bays, formd by Nature, &amp;c.] It is hoped the poet here hath done full justice to his Hero's Character, which it were a great mistake to imagine was wholly sunk in stupidity; he is allowed to have supported it with a wonderful mixture of Vivacity. This character is heightened according to his own desire, in a Letter he wrote to our author. “Pert and dull at least you might have allowed me. What! am I only to be dull, and dull still, and again, and for ever?” He then solemnly appealed to his own conscience, that “he could not think himself so, nor believe that our poet did; but that he spoke worse of him than he could possibly think; and concluded it must be merely to shew his Wit, or for some Profit or Lucre to himself.” Life of C.

Ver. 115. supperless the Hero sate,] It is amazing how the sense of this hath been mistaken by all the former commentators, who most idly suppose it to imply that the Hero of the poem wanted a supper. In truth a great absurdity! Not that we are ignorant that the Hero of Homer's Odyssey is frequently in that circumstance, and therefore it can no way derogate from the grandeur of Epic Poem to represent such Hero under a calamity, to which the greatest, not only of Critics and Poets, but of Kings and Warriors, have been subject. But much more refined, I will venture to say, is the meaning of our author: It was to give us, obliquely, a curious precept, or, what Bossu calls, a disguised sentence, that “Temperance is the life of Study.” The language of poesy brings all into action; and to represent a Critic encompassed with books, but without a supper, is a picture which lively expresseth how much the true Critic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body, one of which he always castigates, and often totally neglects for the greater improvement of the other. Scribl. But since the discovery of the true Hero of the poem, may we not add that nothing was so natural, after so great a loss of Money at Dice, or of Reputation by his Play, as that the Poet should have no great stomach to eat a supper? Besides, how well has the Poet consulted his Heroic Character, in adding that he swore all the time? Bentl.Swearing and supperless the Hero sate, Blasphem'd his Gods, the Dice, and damn'd his Fate. Then gnaw'd his pen, then dash'd it on the ground, Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound! Plung'd for his sense, but found no bottom there, Yet wrote and flounder'd on, in mere despair. Round him much Embryo, much Abortion lay, Much future Ode, and abdicated Play; Nonsense precipitate, like running Lead, That slip'd thro' Cracks and Zig-zags of the Head; All that on Folly Frenzy could beget, Fruits of dull Heat, and Sooterkins of Wit. Next, o'er his Books his eyes began to roll, In pleasing memory of all he stole, How here he sipp'd, how there he plunder'd snug And suck'd all o'er, like an industrious Bug. Remarks.

This Tibbald, or Theobald, published an edition of Shakespear, of which he was so proud himself as to say, in one of Mist's Journals, June 8, “That to expose any Errors in it was impracticable.” And in another, April 27, “That whatever care might for the future be taken by any other Editor, he would still give above five hundred Emendations, that shall escape them all.”There hapless Shakespear, yet of Tibbald sore, Remarks.

Settle was his Brother Laureate; only indeed upon half-pay, for the City instead of the Court; but equally famous for unintelligible flights in his poems on public occasions, such as Shows, Birth-days, &amp;c. 2. Banks was his Rival in Tragedy (tho' more successful in one of his Tragedies, the Earl of Essex, which is yet alive: Anna Boleyn, the Queen of Scots, and Cyrus the Great, are dead and gone. These he drest in a sort of Beggars Velvet, or a happy mixture of the thick Fustian and thin Prosaic; exactly imitated in Perolla and Isidora, Cæsar in Ægypt, and the Heroic Daughter. 3. Broome was a serving-man of Ben. Johnson, who once picked up a Comedy from his Betters, or from some cast scenes of his Master, not entirely contemptible.Well purg'd, and worthy Settle, Banks, and Broome. Remarks. Ver. 147. More solid Learning] Some have objected, that books of this sort suit not so well the library of our Bays, which they imagine consisted of Novels, Plays, and obscene books; but they are to consider, that he furnished his shelves only for ornament, and read these books no more than the Dry bodies of Divinity, which, no doubt, were purchased by his Father when he designed him for the Gown. See the note on v 200.But, high above, more solid Learning shone, The Classics of an Age that heard of none; Remarks. Ver. 149. Caxton] A Printer in the time of Ed. IV, Rich. III, and Hen. VII; Wynkyn de Word, his successor, in that of Hen. VII and VIII. The former translated into prose Virgil's Æneis, as a history; of which he speaks, in his Proeme, in a very singular manner, as of a book hardly known. “Happened that to my hande cam a lytyl book in frenche, whiche late was translated out of latyn by some noble clerke of fraunce, whiche booke is named Eneydos (made in latyn by that noble poete &amp; grete clerk Vyrgyle) whiche booke I sawe over and redde therein, How after the general destruccyon of the grete Troy, Eneas departed berynge his olde fader anchises upon his sholdres, his lytyl son yolas on his hande, his wyfe with moche other people followynge, and how he shipped and departed; wyth alle thystorye of his adventures that he had er he came to the atchievement of his conquest of ytalye, as all alonge shall be shewed in this present booke. In whiche booke I had grete playsyr, by cause of the fayr and honest termes &amp; wordes in frenche, whiche I never sawe to fore lyke, ne none so playsaunt ne so well ordred; whiche booke as me semed sholde be moche requysite to noble men to see, as wel for the eloquence as the hystoryes. How wel that many hondred yerys passed was the sayd booke of Eneydos wyth other workes made and lerned dayly in scolis, especyally in ytayle and other places, which historye the sayd Vyrgyle made in metre.”There Caxton slept, with Wynkyn at his side, One clasp'd in wood, and one in strong cow-hide; There, sav'd by spice, like Mummies, many a year, Dry Bodies of Divinity appear: Remarks.

Philemon Holland Doctor in Physic. He translated so many books, that a man would think he had done nothing else; insomuch that he might be called Translator general of his age. The books alone of his turning into English are sufficient to make a Country Gentleman a complete Library. Winstanl.And here the groaning shelves Philemon bends. Of these twelve volumes, twelve of amplest size, Redeem'd from tapers and defrauded pies, Inspir'd he seizes: These an altar raise: An hecatomb of pure, unsully'd lays That altar crowns: A folio Common-place Founds the whole pile, of all his works the base: Quartos, octavos, shape the less'ning pyre; A twisted Birth-day Ode completes the spire. Then he: Great Tamer of all human art! First in my care, and ever at my heart; Dulness! whose good old cause I yet defend, Imitations. Ver. 166.

Horat.With whom my Muse began, with whom shall end; Remarks. Ver. 167. E'er since Sir Fopling's Periwig] The first visible cause of the passion of the Town for our Hero, was a fair flaxen full-bottom'd Periwig, which, he tells us, he wore in his first play of the Fool in fashion. It attracted, in a particular manner, the Friendship of Col. Brett, who wanted to purchase it. “Whatever contempt (says he) Philosophers may have for a fine Periwig, my friend, who was not to despise the world but to live in it, knew very well that so material an article of dress upon the head of a man of sense, if it became him, could never fail of drawing to him a more partial Regard and Benevolence, than could possibly be hoped for in an ill-made one. This perhaps, may soften the grave censure which so youthful a purchase might otherwise have laid upon him. In a word, he made his attack upon this Periwig, as your young fellows generally do upon a lady of pleasure, first by a few familiar praises of her person, and then a civil enquiry into the price of it; and we finished our bargain that night over a bottle.” See Life, octavo p. 303. This remarkable Periwig usually made its entrance upon the stage in a sedan, brought in by two chairmen, with infinite approbation of the audience.E'er since Sir Fopling's Periwig was Praise, To the last honours of the Butt and Bays: O thou! of Bus'ness the directing soul! To this our head like byass to the bowl, Which, as more pond'rous, made its aim more true, Obliquely wadling to the mark in view: O! ever gracious to perplex'd mankind, Still spread a healing mist before the mind; And lest we err by Wit's wild dancing light, Secure us kindly in our native night. Or, if to Wit a coxcomb make pretence, Remarks. Ver. 178, 179. Guard the sure barrier—Or quite unravel, &amp;c.] For Wit or Reasoning are never greatly hurtful to Dulness, but when the first is founded in Truth, and the other in Usefulness.Guard the sure barrier between that and Sense; Or quite unravel all the reas'ning thread, And hang some curious cobweb in its stead! As, forc'd from wind-guns, lead itself can fly, And pond'rous slugs cut swiftly thro the sky; As clocks to weight their nimble motion owe, The wheels above urg'd by the load below: Me Emptiness, and Dulness could inspire, And were my Elasticity, and Fire. Some Dæmon stole my pen (forgive th'offence) And once betray'd me into common sense: Else all my Prose and Verse were much the same; This, prose on stilts; that, poetry fall'n lame. Did on the stage my Fops appear confin'd? My Life gave ampler lessons to mankind. Did the dead Letter unsuccessful prove? The brisk Example never fail'd to move. Imitations. Ver. 195. Had Heav'n decreed, &amp;c. Me si cœlicolæ voluissent ducere vitam, Has mihi servassent sedes. ? Virg. Æn ii.Yet sure had Heav'n decreed to save the State, Imitations. Ver. 196, 197. Could Troy be sav'd—This grey-goose weapon] ? Si Pergama dextra Defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent. Virg. ibid.Heav'n had decreed these works a longer date. Could Troy be sav'd by any single hand, This grey-goose weapon must have made her stand. Remarks. Ver. 199. my Fletcher] A familiar manner of speaking, used by modern Critics, of a favourite author. Bays might as justly speak thus of Fletcher, as a French Wit did of Tully, seeing his works in a library, “Ah! mon cher Ciceron! je le connois bien; c'est le même que Marc Tulle.” But he had a better title to call Fletcher his own, having made so free with him.What can I now? my Fletcher cast aside, Remarks. Ver. 200. Take up the Bible, once my better guide?] When, according to his Father's intention, he had been a Clergyman, or (as he thinks himself) a Bishop of the Church of England. Hear his own words: “At the time that the fate of King James, the Prince of Orange and Myself, were on the anvil, Providence thought fit to postpone mine, 'till theirs were determined: But had my father carried me a month sooner to the University, who knows but that purer fountain might have washed my Imperfections into a capacity of writing, instead of Plays and annual Odes, Sermons and Pastoral Letters?” Apology for his Life, chap. iii.Take up the Bible, once my better guide? Or tread the path by vent'rous Heroes trod, Imitations. Ver. 202. This Box my Thunder, this Right hand my God.] Dextra mihi Deus, &amp; telum quod missile libro. Virgil of the Gods of Mezentius.This Box my Thunder, this right hand my God? Remarks. V. 203. at White's amidst the Doctors] “These Doctors had a modest and fair Appearance, and, like true Masters of Arts, were habited in black and white; they were justly styled subtiles and graves, but not always irrefragabiles, being sometimes examined, laid open, and split.” Scribl. This learned Critic is to be understood allegorically: The Doctors in this place mean no more than false Dice, a Cant phrase used amongst Gamesters. So the meaning of these four sonorous Lines is only this, “Shall I play fair, or foul?”Or chair'd at White's amidst the Doctors sit, Teach Oaths to Gamesters, and to Nobles Wit? Or bidst thou rather Party to embrace? Remarks. Ver. 206. Ridpath—Mist.] George Ridpath, author of a Whig paper, called the Flying post; Nathanael Mist, of a famous Tory Journal.(A friend to Party thou, and all her race; 'Tis the same rope at different ends they twist; To Dulness Ridpath is as dear as Mist.) Shall I, like Curtius, desp'rate in my zeal, O'er head and ears plunge for the Commonweal? Remarks. Ver. 211. Or rob Rome's ancient geese of all their glories,] Relates to the well-known story of the geese that saved the Capitol; of which Virgil, Æn. viii. Atque hic auratis volitans argenteus anser Porticibus, Gallos in limine adesse canebat. A passage I have always suspected. Who sees not the antithesis of auratis and argenteus to be unworthy the Virgilian majesty? And what absurdity to say a goose sings? canebat. Virgil gives a contrary character of the voice of this silly bird, in Ecl. ix. ? argutos interstrepere anser olores. Read it, therefore, adesse strepebat. And why auratis porticibus? does not the very verse preceding this inform us, Romulcoque recens horrebat regia culmo. Is this thatch in one line, and gold in another, consistent? I scruple not (repugnantibus omnibus manuscriptis) to correct it auritis. Horace uses the same epithet in the same sense, ? Auritas fidibus canoris Ducere quercus. And to say that walls have ears is common even to a proverb. Scribl.Or rob Rome's ancient geese of all their glories, Remarks. Ver. 212. And cackling save the Monarchy of Tories?] Not out of any presence or affection to the Tories. For what Hobbes so ingenuously confesses of himself, is true of all Party-writers whatsoever: “That he defends the supreme powers, as the Geese by their cackling defended the Romans, who held the Capitol; for they favoured them no more than the Gauls their Enemies, but were as ready to have defended the Gauls if they had been possessed of the Capitol.” Epist. Dedic. to the Leviathan.And cackling save the Monarchy of Tories? Hold—to the Minister I more incline; To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine. Remarks. Ver. 219. Gazetteers] A band of ministerial writers, hired at the price mentioned in the note on book ii. ver. 316. who on the very day their Patron quitted his post, laid down their paper, and declared they would never more meddle in Politics.And see! thy very Gazetteers give o'er, Ev'n Ralph repents, and Henly writes no more. What then remains? Ourself. Still, still remain Remarks. Ver. 218. Cibberian forehead] So indeed all the MSS. read; but I make no scruple to pronounce them all wrong, the Laureate being elsewhere celebrated by our Poet for his great Modesty—modest Cibber—Read, therefore, at my peril, Cerberian forehead. This is perfectly classical, and, what is more, Homerical; the Dog was the ancient, as the Bitch is the modern, symbol of Impudence: (????? ?????? ????, says Achilles to Agamemnon) which, when in a superlative degree, may well be denominated from Cerberus, the Dog with three heads.— But as to the latter part of this verse, Cibberian brain, that is certainly the genuine reading. Bentl.Cibberian forehead, and Cibberian brain. This brazen Brightness, to the 'Squire so dear; This polish'd Hardness, that reflects the Peer; This arch Absurd, that wit and fool delights; This Mess, toss'd up of Hockley-hole and White's; Where Dukes and Butchers join to wreathe my crown, At once the Bear and Fiddle of the town. Remarks. Ver. 225. O born in sin, &amp;c.] This is a tender and passionate Apostrophe to his own works, which he is going to sacrifice, agreeable to the nature of man in great affliction; and reflecting like a parent on the many miserable fates to which they would otherwise be subject.O born in sin, and forth in folly brought! Works damn'd, or to be damn'd! (your father's fault) Go, purify'd by flames ascend the sky, Remarks. Ver. 228. My better and more christian progeny!] “It may be observable, that my muse and my spouse were equally prolific; that the one was seldom the mother of a Child, but in the same year the other made me the father of a Play. I think we had a dozen of each sort between us; of both which kinds some died in their Infancy,” &amp;c. Life of C. C. p. 217. 8vo edit.My better and more christian progeny! Imitations. Ver. 229. Unstain'd, untouch'd, &amp;c. ? Felix Priamëia virgo! Jussa mori: quae sortitus non pertulit ullos, Nec victoris heri tetigit captiva cubile! Nos, patria incensa, diversa per æquora vectæ, &amp;c. Virg. Æn. iii.Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets; While all your smutty sisters walk the streets. Remarks. Ver. 231. gratis given Bland—Sent with a Pass,] It was a practice so to give the Daily Gazetteer and ministerial pamphlets (in which this B. was a writer) and to send them Post-free to all the Towns in the kingdom.Ye shall not beg, like gratis-given Bland, Sent with a Pass, and vagrant thro' the land; Remarks. Ver. 233. —with Ward, to Ape-and-monkey climes,] “Edward Ward, a very voluminous Poet in Hudibrastic verse, but best known by the London Spy, in prose. He has of late years kept a public house in the City, (but in a genteel way) and with his wit, humour, and good liquor (ale) afforded his guests a pleasurable entertainment, especially those of the high-church party.” Jacob, Lives of Poets, vol. ii. p. 225. Great numbers of his works were yearly sold into the Plantations.—Ward, in a book called Apollo's Maggot, declared this account to be a great falsity, protesting that his public house was not in the City, but in Moorfields.Not sail, with Ward, to Ape-and-monkey climes, Where vile Mundungus trucks for viler rhymes; Not sulphur-tipt, emblaze an Ale-house fire; Not wrap up Oranges, to pelt your sire! O! pass more innocent, in infant state, Remarks. Ver. 238 &amp; 240. Tate—Shadwell] Two of his predecessors in the Laurel.To the mild Limbo of our Father Tate: Or peaceably forgot, at once be blest In Shadwell's bosom with eternal Rest! Imitations. Ver. 241. And thrice he lifted high the Birth-day brand,] Ovid of Althæa on a like occasion, burning her offspring: Tum conata quater flammis imponere torrem, Cœpta quater tenuit.Soon to that mass of Nonsense to return, Where things destroy'd are swept to things unborn. Remarks. Ver. 243. With that, a Tear (portentous sign of Grace!) &amp;c.] It is to be observed that our Poet hath made his Hero, in imitation of Virgil's, obnoxious to the tender Passions. He was indeed so given to weeping, that he tells ut, when Goodman the player swore, if he did not make a good actor, he'd be damn'd; “the surprise of being commended by one who had been himself so eminent on the stage, and in so positive a manner, was more than he could support. In a word (says he) it almost took away my breath and (laugh if you please) fairly drew tears from my eyes.” P. 149. of his Life, octavo.With that, a Tear (portentous sign of Grace!) Stole from the Master of the sev'nfold Face: And thrice he lifted high the Birth-day brand, And thrice he dropt it from his quiv'ring hand; Then lights the structure, with averted eyes: The rowling smokes involve the sacrifice. The op'ning clouds disclose each work by turns, Remarks. Ver. 250. Now flames the Cid, &amp;c.] In the first notes on the Dunciad it was said, that this Author was particularly excellent at Tragedy. “This (says he) is as unjust as to say I could not dance on a Rope.” But certain it is that he had attempted to dance on this Rope, and fell most shamefully, having produced no less than four Tragedies (the names of which the Poet preserves in these few lines) the three first of them were fairly printed, acted, and damned; the fourth suppressed, in fear of the like treatment. Imitations. Ver. 250. Now flames the Cid, &amp;c.] ? Jam Deïphobi dedit ampla ruinam Vulcano superante domus; jam proximus ardet Ucalegon. ?Now flames the Cid, and now Perolla burns; Great Cæsar roars, and hisses in the fires; King John in silence modestly expires: No merit now the dear Nonjuror claims, Remarks. Ver. 254. the dear Nonjuror—Moliere's old stubble] A Comedy threshed out of Moliere's Tartuffe, and so much the Translator's favourite, that he assures us all our author's dislike to it could only arise from disaffection to the Government; Qui meprise Cotin, n'estime point son Roi, Et n'a, selon Cotin, ni Dieu, ni foi, ni loi. Boil. He assures us, that “when he had the honour to kiss his Majesty's hand upon presenting his dedication of it, he was graciously pleased, out of his Royal bounty, to order him two hundred pounds for it. And this he doubts not grieved Mr. P.”Moliere's old stubble in a moment flames. Tears gush'd again, as from pale Priam's eyes Remarks. Ver. 256. When the last blaze sent Ilion to the skies.] See Virgil, Æn. ii. where I would advise the reader to peruse the story of Troy's destruction, rather than in Wynkyn. But I caution him alike in both to beware of a most grievous error, that of thinking it was brought about by I know not what Trojan Horse; there never having been any such thing. For, first, it was not Trojan, being made by the Greeks; and, secondly, it was not a horse, but a mare. This is clear from many verses in Virgil: ? Uterumque armato milite complent. ? Inclusos utero Danaos ? Can a horse be said Utero gerere? Again, ? Uteroque recusso, Insonuere cavæ ? ? Atque utero sonitum quater arma dedere. Nay, is it not expresly said Scandit fatalis machina muros Fœta armis ? How is it possible the word fœta can agree with a horse? And indeed can it be conceived that the chaste and virgin Goddess Pallas would employ herself in forming and fashioning the Male of that species? But this shall be proved to a demonstration in our Virgil restored. Scribl.When the last blaze sent Ilion to the skies. Rowz'd by the light, old Dulness heav'd the head; Remarks. Ver. 258. Thulè] An unfinished poem of that name, of which one sheet was printed many years ago, by Amb. Philips, a northern author. It is an usual method of putting out a fire, to cast wet sheets upon it. Some critics have been of opinion that this sheet was of the nature of the Asbestos, which cannot be consumed by fire: But I rather think it an allegorical allusion to the coldness and heaviness of the writing.Then snatch'd a sheet of Thulè from her bed, Sudden she flies, and whelms it o'er the pyre; Down sink the flames, and with a hiss expire. Her ample presence fills up all the place; A veil of fogs dilates her awful face: Imitations. Ver. 263. Great in her charms! as when on Shrieves and May'rs She looks and breathes herself into their airs.] Alma parens confessa Deam; qualisque videri Cœlicolis, &amp; quanta solet ? Virg. Æn. ii. Et lætos oculis afflavit honores. Id. Æn. i.Great in her charms! as when on Shrieves and May'rs She looks, and breathes herself into their airs. Remarks. Ver. 265. sacred Dome:] Where he no sooner enters, but he reconnoitres the place of his original; as Plato says the spirits shall, at their entrance into the celestial regions.She bids him wait her to her sacred Dome: Well pleas'd he enter'd, and confess'd his home. So Spirits ending their terrestrial race, Ascend, and recognize their Native Place. Remarks. Ver. 269. Great Mother] Magna mater, here applied to Dulness. The Quid-nuncs, a name given to the ancient members of certain political clubs, who were constantly enquiring quid nunc? what news? Imitations. Ver. 269. This the Great Mother, &amp;c.] Urbs antiqua fuit ? Quam Juno fertur terris magis omnibus unam Posthabita coluisse Samo: hic illius arma, Hic currus fuit: hic regnum Dea gentibus esse (Si qua fata sinant) jam tum tenditque fovetque. Virg. Æn. i.This the Great Mother dearer held than all The clubs of Quidnuncs, or her own Guild-hall: Here stood her Opium, her she nurs'd her Owls, And here she plann'd th'Imperial seat of Fools. Here to her Chosen all her works she shews; Prose swell'd to verse, verse loit'ring into prose: How random thoughts now meaning chance to find, Now leave all memory of sense behind: How Prologues into Prefaces decay, And these to Notes are fritter'd quite away: How Index-learning turns no student pale, Yet holds the eel of science by the tail: How, with less reading than makes felons scape, Less human genius than God gives an ape, Small thanks to France, and none to Rome or Greece, A past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new piece, 'Twixt Plautus, Fletcher, Shakespear, and Corneille, Remarks. Ver. 286. Tibbald,] Lewis Tibbald (as pronounced) or Theobald (as written) was bred an Attorney, and son to an Attorney (says Mr. Jacob) of Sittenburn in Kent. He was Author of some forgotten Plays, Translations, and other pieces. He was concerned in a paper called the Censor, and a Translation of Ovid. “There is a notorious Idiot, one hight Whachum, who, from an under-spur-leather to the Law, is become an under-strapper to the Play-house, who hath lately burlesqued the Metamorphoses of Ovid by a vile Translation, &amp;c. This fellow is concerned in an impertinent paper called the Censor.” Dennis Rem. on Pope's Hom. p. 9, 10. Ibid. Ozell.] “Mr. John Ozell (if we credit Mr. Jacob) did go to school in Leicestershire, where somebody left him something to live on, when he shall retire from business. He was designed to be sent to Cambridge, in order for priesthood; but he chose rather to be placed in an office of accounts, in the City, being qualified for the same by his skill in arithmetic, and writing the necessary hands. He has obliged the world with many translations of French Plays.” Jacob, Lives of Dram. Poets, p. 198. Mr. Jacob's character of Mr. Ozell seems vastly short of his merits, and he ought to have further justice done him, having since fully confuted all Sarcasms on his learning and genius, by an advertisement of Sept. 20, 1729. in a paper called the Weekly Medley, &amp;c. “As to my learning, every body knows that the whole bench of Bishops, not long ago, were pleased to give me a purse of guineas, for discovering the erroneous translations of the Common-prayer in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, &amp;c. As for my genius, let Mr. Cleland shew better verses in all Pope's works, than Ozell's version of Boileau's Lutrin, which the late Lord Halifax was so pleased with, that he complimented him with leave to dedicate it to him, &amp;c. &amp;c. Let him shew better and truer Poetry in the Rape of the Lock, than in Ozell's Rape of the Bucket (la Secchia rapita.) And Mr. Toland and Mr. Gildon publicly declared Ozell's translation of Homer to be, as it was prior, so likewise superior to Pope's.—Surely, surely, every man is free to deserve well of his country! John Ozell. We cannot but subscribe to such reverend testimonies, as those of the Bench of Bishops, Mr. Toland, and Mr. Gildon.Can make a Cibber, Tibbald, or Ozell.

Withers,] “George Withers was a great Pretender to Poetical Zeal, and abused the greatest Personages in power, which brought upon him frequent correction. The Marshalsea and Newgate were no strangers to him.” Winstanly, Lives of Poets. Ibid. Gildon] Charles Gildon, a writer of criticisms and libels of the last age, bred at St. Omer's with the Jesuits; but renouncing popery, he published Blount's books against the divinity of Christ, the Oracles of Reason, &amp;c. He signalized himself as a critic, having written some very bad plays; abused Mr. P. very scandalously in an anonymous pamphlet of the Life of Mr. Wycherley, printed by Curl; in another, called the New Rehearsal, printed in 1714; in a third, entituled the Complete Art of English Poetry, in two volumes; and others.Where wretched Withers, Ward, and Gildon rest, Remarks. Ver. 297. Howard,] Hon. Edward Howard, author of the British Princes, and a great number of wonderful pieces, celebrated by the late Earls of Dorset and Rochester, Duke of Buckingham, Mr. Waller, &amp;c.And high-born Howard, more majestic sire, With Fool of Quality compleats the quire. Thou Cibber! thou, his Laurel shalt support, Folly, my son, has still a Friend at Court. Lift up your Gates, ye Princes, see him come! Sound, sound ye Viols, be the Cat-call dumb! Bring, bring the madding Bay, the drunken Vine; The creeping, dirty, courtly Ivy join. And thou! his Aid de camp, lead on my sons, Light-arm'd with Points, Antitheses, and Puns. Let Bawdry, Bilingsgate, my daughters dear, Support his front, and Oaths bring up the rear: Remarks. Ver. 309, 310. Under Archer's wing,—Gaming, &amp;c.] When the Statute against Gaming was drawn up, it was represented, that the King, by ancient custom, plays at Hazard one night in the year; and therefore a clause was inserted, with an exception as to that particular. Under this pretence, the Groomporter had a Room appropriated to Gaming all the summer the Court was at Kensington, which his Majesty accidentally being acquainted of, with a just indignation prohibited. It is reported, the same practice is yet continued wherever the Court resides, and the Hazard Table there open to all the professed Gamesters in town. Greatest and justest Sov'reign! know you this? Alas! no more, than Thames' calm head can know Whose meads his arms drown, or whose corn o'erflow. Donne to Queen Eliz.And under his, and under Archer's wing, Gaming and Grub-street skulk behind the King. Remarks. Ver. 311. O when shall rise a Monarch, &amp;c.] Boileau, Lutrin, Chant. 2. Helas! qu'est devenu cet tems, cet heureux tems, Où les Rois s'honoroient du nom de Faineans: S'endormoient sur le trone, &amp; me servant sans honte, Laissoient leur sceptre au mains ou d'un mair, ou d'un comte: Aucun soin n'approchoit de leur paisible cour, On reposoit la nuit, on dormoit tout le jour, &amp;c.O! when shall rise a Monarch all our own, And I, a Nursing-mother, rock the throne, 'Twixt Prince and People close the Curtain draw, Shade him from Light, and cover him from Law; Fatten the Courtier, starve the learned band, And suckle Armies, and dry-nurse the land: 'Till Senates nod to Lullabies divine, And all be sleep, as at an Ode of thine.

But pious Needham] A Matron of great fame, and very religious in her way; whose constant prayer it was, that she might “get enough by her profession to leave it off in time, and make her peace with God.” But her fate was not so happy; for being convicted, and set in the pillory, she was (to the lasting shame of all her great Friends and Votaries) so ill used by the populace, that it put an end to her days.But pious Needham dropt the name of God; Remarks. Ver. 325.

So when Jove's block descended from on high Remarks. Ver. 328. —Ogilby)—God save king Log!] See Ogilby's Æsop's Fables, where, in the story of the Frogs and their King, this excellent hemistic is to be found. Our Author manifests here, and elsewhere, a prodigious tenderness for the bad writers. We see he selects the only good passage, perhaps, in all that ever Ogilby writ; which shews how candid and patient a reader he must have been. What can be more kind and affectionate than these words in the preface to his Poems, where he labours to call up all our humanity and forgiveness toward these unlucky men, by the most moderate representation of their case that has ever been given by any author? “Much may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets: What we call a genius is hard to be distinguished, by a man himself, from a prevalent inclination: And if it be never so great, he can at first discover it no other way than by that strong propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. He has no other method but to make the experiment, by writing, and so appealing to the judgment of others: And if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no sin in itself) he is immediately made the object of ridicule! I wish we had the humanity to reflect, that even the worst authors might endeavour to please us, and, in that endeavour, deserve something at our hands. We have no cause to quarrel with them, but for their obstinacy in persisting, and even that may admit of alleviating circumstances: For their particular friends may be either ignorant, or unsincere; and the rest of the world too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of.” But how much all indulgence is lost upon these people may appear from the just reflection made on their constant conduct, and constant fate, in the following Epigram: Ye little Wits, that gleam'd a while, When Pope vouchsaf'd a ray, Alas! depriv'd of his kind smile, How soon ye fade away! To compass Phœbus' car about, Thus empty vapours rise; Each lends his cloud, to put Him out, That rear'd him to the skies. Alas! those skies are not your sphere; There He shall ever burn: Weep, weep, and fall! for Earth ye were, And must to Earth return.(As sings thy great forefather Ogilby) Loud thunder to its bottom shook the bog, And the hoarse nation croak'd, God save King Log! The End of the First Book. Book the Second. ARGUMENT. The King being proclaimed, the solemnity is graced with public Games and sports of various kinds; not instituted by the Hero, as by Æneas in Virgil, but for greater honour by the Goddess in person (in like manner as the games Pythia, Isthmia, &amp;c. were anciently said to be ordained by the Gods, and as Thetis herself appearing, according to Homer, Odyss. 24. proposed the prizes in honour of her son Achilles.) Hither flock the Poets and Critics, attended, as is but just, with their Patrons and Booksellers. The Goddess is first pleased, for her disport, to propose games to the Booksellers, and setteth up the Phantom of a Poet, which they contend to overtake. The Races described, with their divers accidents. Next, the game for a Poetess. Then follow the Exercises for the Poets, of tickling, vociferating, diving: The first holds forth the arts and practices of Dedicators, the second of Disputants and fustian Poets, the third of profound, dark, and dirty Party-writers. Lastly, for the Critics, the Goddess proposes (with great propriety) an Exercise, not of their parts, but their patience, in hearing the works of two voluminous Authors, one in verse, and the other in prose, deliberately read, without sleeping: The various effects of which, with the several degrees and manners of their operation, are here set forth; 'till the whole number, not of Critics only, but of spectators, actors, and all present, fall fast asleep; which naturally and necessarily ends the games. Remarks. Two things there are, upon the supposition of which the very basis of all Verbal criticism is founded and supported: The first, that an Author could never fail to use the best word on every occasion; the second, that a Critic cannot chuse but know which that is. This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, first, that the author could never have used it; and, secondly, that he must have used that very one which we conjecture in its stead. We cannot, therefore, enough admire the learned Scriblerus for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the preceding book, which in all the former editions stood thus: Hoarse thunder to its bottom shook the bog, And the loud nation croak'd, God save king Log. He has, with great judgment, transposed these two epithets; putting hoarse to the nation, and loud to the thunder: And this being evidently the true reading, he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former; for which assertion of the just right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all sound Commentators.

Ibid. or Fleckno's Irish throne,] Richard Fleckno was an Irish priest, but had laid aside (as himself expressed it) the mechanic part of priesthood. He printed some plays, poems, letters, and travels. I doubt not our author took occasion to mention him in respect to the Poem of Mr. Dryden, to which this bears some resemblance, though of a character more different from it than that of the Æneid from the Iliad, or the Lutrin of Boileau from the Defait de Bouts rimées of Sarazin. It may be just worth mentioning, that the Eminence from whence the ancient Sophists entertained their auditors, was called by the pompous name of a Throne; —??? ?????? ????? ?????? ???? ?????????? ??? ???????.

Mr. Curl loudly complained of this note, as an untruth; protesting “that he stood in the pillory, not in March, but in February.” And of another on ver. 152. saying, “he was not tossed in a Blanket, but a Rug.” Curliad, duodecimo, 1729, p. 19, 25. Much in the same manner Mr. Cibber remonstrated that his Brothers at Bedlam, mentioned Book i. were not Brazen, but Blocks; yet our author let it pass unaltered, as a trifle, that no way lessened the Relationship.Or that where on her Curls the Public pours, All-bounteous, fragrant Grains and Golden show'rs, Great Cibber sate: The proud Parnassian sneer, The conscious simper, and the jealous leer, Mix on his look: All eyes direct their rays On him, and crowds turn Coxcombs as they gaze.

Rome in her Capitol saw Querno sit,] Camillo Querno was of Apulia, who hearing the great Encouragement which Leo X. gave to poets, travelled to Rome with a harp in his hand, and sung to it twenty thousand verses of a poem called Alexias. He was introduced as a Buffoon to Leo, and promoted to the honour of the Laurel; a jest which the court of Rome and the Pope himself entered into so far, as to cause him to ride on an elephant to the Capitol, and to hold a solemn festival on his coronation; at which it is recorded the Poet himself was so transported as to weep for joy See Life of C. C. chap. vi. p. 149.. He was ever after a constant frequenter of the Pope's table, drank abundantly, and poured forth verses without number. Paulus Jovius, Elog. Vir. doct. chap. lxxxii. Some idea of his poetry is given by Fam. Strada, in his Prolusions.Rome in her Capitol saw Querno sit, Thron'd on sev'n hills, the Antichrist of wit. And now the Queen, to glad her sons, proclaims By herald Hawkers, high heroic Games. They summon all her Race: An endless band Pours forth, and leaves unpeopled half the land.

Amid that area wide they took their stand, Where the tall may-pole once o'er-look'd the Strand; But now (so Anne and Piety ordain) A Church collects the saints of Drury-lane.

A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead;] i. e. A trifling head, and a contracted heart, as the poet, book 4. describes the accomplished Sons of Dulness; of whom this is only an Image, or Scarecrow, and so stuffed out with these corresponding materials. Scribl.A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead; And empty words she gave, and sounding strain, But senseless, lifeless! idol void and vain! Remarks. Ver. 47. Never was dash'd out, at one lucky hit,] Our author here seems willing to give some account of the possibility of Dulness making a Wit (which could be done no other way than by chance.) The fiction is the more reconciled to probability, by the known story of Apelles, who being at a loss to express the foam of Alexander's horse, dashed his pencil in despair at the picture, and happened to do it by that fortunate stroke. Imitations. The reader will observe how exactly some of these verses suit with their allegorical application here to a Plagiary: There seems to me a great propriety in this Episode, where such an one is imaged by a phantom that deludes the grasp of the expecting Bookseller.Never was dash'd out, at one lucky hit, A fool, so just a copy of a wit; So like, that critics said, and courtiers swore, Remarks. Ver. 50. and call'd the phantom More.] Curl, in his Key to the Dunciad, affirmed this to be James-More Smith esq. and it is probable (considering what is said of him in the Testimonies) that some might fancy our author obliged to represent this gentleman as a plagiary, or to pass for one himself. His case indeed was like that of a man I have heard of, who, as he was sitting in company, perceived his next neighbour had stolen his handkerchief. “Sir (said the thief, finding himself detected) do not expose me, I did it for mere want; be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again, and say nothing.” The honest man did so, but the other cry'd out, “See, gentlemen, what a thief we have among us! look, he is stealing my handkerchief!” The plagiarisms of this person gave occasion to the following Epigram: More always smiles whenever he recites; He smiles (you think) approving what he writes. And yet in this no vanity is shown; A modest man may like what's not his own. His only work was a Comedy called the Rival Modes; the town condemned it in the action, but he printed it in 1726/27, with this modest Motto, Hic cæstus artemque repono. Remarks. Ver. 50. the phantom More.] It appears from hence, that this is not the name of a real person, but fictitious. More from ?????, stultus, ?????, stultitia, to represent the folly of a plagiary. Thus Erasmus, Admonuit me Mori cognomen tibi, quod tam ad Moriæ vocabulum accedit quam es ipse a re alienus. Dedication of Moriæ Encomium to Sir Tho. More; the farewell of which may be our author's to his plagiary, Vale, More! &amp; moriam tuam gnaviter defende. Adieu, More! and be sure strongly to defend thy own folly. Scribl.A Wit it was, and call'd the phantom More. All gaze with ardour: Some a poet's name, Others a sword-knot and lac'd suit inflame. Remarks. Ver. 53. But lofty Lintot] We enter here upon the episode of the Booksellers: Persons, whose names being more known and famous in the learned world than those of the Authors in this poem, do therefore need less explanation. The action of Mr. Lintot here imitates that of Dares in Virgil, rising just in this manner to lay hold on a Bull. This eminent Bookseller printed the Rival Modes before mentioned.But lofty Lintot in the circle rose: “This prize is mine; who tempt it are my foes; With me began this genius, and shall end.” He spoke: and who with Lintot shall contend? Fear held them mute. Alone, untaught to fear, Remarks. Ver. 58. Stood dauntless Curl;] We come now to a character of much respect, that of Mr. Edmund Curl. As a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them, we shall only say of this eminent man, that he carried the Trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at; and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession. He possessed himself of a command over all authors whatever; he caused them to write what he pleased; they could not call their very Names their own. He was not only famous among these; he was taken notice of by the State, the Church, and the Law, and received particular marks of distinction from each. It will be owned that he is here introduced with all possible dignity: He speaks like the intrepid Diomed; he runs like the swift-footed Achilles; if he falls, 'tis like the beloved Nisus; and (what Homer makes to be the chief of all praises) he is favoured of the Gods; he says but three words, and his prayer is heard; a Goddess conveys it to the seat of Jupiter: Though he loses the prize, he gains the victory; the great Mother herself comforts him, she inspires him with expedients, she honours him with an immortal present (such as Achilles receives from Thetis, and Æneas from Venus) at once instructive and prophetical: After this he is unrivalled and triumphant. The tribute our author hore pays him is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations: Many weighty animadversions on the public affairs, and many excellent and diverting pieces on private persons, has he given to his name. If ever he owed two verses to any other, he owed Mr. Curl some thousands. He was every day extending his fame, and enlarging his Writings: Witness innumerable instances; but it shall suffice only to mention the Court Poems, which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer, a Lady of quality; but being first threatned, and afterwards punished for it by Mr. Pope, he generously transferred it from her to him, and ever since printed it in his name. The single time that ever he spoke to C. was on that affair, and to that happy incident he ow'd all the favours since received from him: So true is the saying of Dr. Sydenham, “that any one shall be, at some time or other, the better or the worse, for having but seen or spoken to a good or bad man.”Stood dauntless Curl; “Behold that rival here! “The race by vigour, not by vaunts is won; Imitations. Ver. 60. So take the hindmost, Hell.] Occupet extremum scabies; mihi turpe relinqui est. Horat. de Arte.“So take the hindmost, Hell.”—He said, and run. Imitations. Ver. 61. &amp;c. Something like this is in Homer, Il. x. v 220. of Diomed. Two different manners of the same author in his similies are also imitated in the two following; the first, of the Bailiff, is short, unadorned, and (as the Critics well know) from familiar life; the second, of the Water-fowl, more extended, picturesque, and from rural life. The 59th verse is likewise a literal translation of one in Homer.Swift as a bard the bailiff leaves behind, He left huge Lintot, and out-strip'd the wind. As when a dab-chick waddles thro' the copse Imitations. Ver. 64, 65. On feet and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops; So lab'ring on, with sholders, hands, and head, ?

Curl's Corinna] This name, it seems, was taken by one Mrs. T?, who procured some private letters of Mr. Pope's, while almost a boy, to Mr. Cromwell, and sold them without the consent of either of those Gentlemen to Curl, who printed them in 12mo, 1727. He discovered her to be the publisher, in his Key, p. 11. We only take this opportunity of mentioning the manner in which those letters got abroad, which the author was ashamed of as very trivial things, full not only of levities, but of wrong judgments of men and books, and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer. Imitations. Ver. 70. And Bernard! Bernard!] ? Ut littus, Hyla, Hyla, omne sonaret. Virg. Ecl. vi.Which Curl's Corinna chanc'd that morn to make: (Such was her wont, at early dawn to drop Her evening cates before his neighbour's shop,) Imitations. Ver. 73. Here fortun'd Curl to slide;] Labitur infelix, cæsis ut forte juvencis Fusus humum viridesque super madefecerat herbas— Concidit, immundoque fimo, sacroque cruore. Virg. Æn. v. of Nisus.Here fortun'd Curl to slide; loud shout the band, And Bernard! Bernard! rings thro' all the Strand. Remarks. Ver. 75. Obscene with filth, &amp;c.] Though this incident may seem too low and base for the dignity of an Epic poem, the learned very well know it to be but a copy of Homer and Virgil; the very words ????? and fimus are used by them, though our poet (in compliance to modern nicety) has remarkably enriched and coloured his language, as well as raised the versification, in this Episode, and in the following one of Eliza. Mr. Dryden in Mack-Fleckno, has not scrupled to mention the Morning Toast at which the fishes bite in the Thames, Pissing Alley, Reliques of the Bum, &amp;c. but our author is more grave, and (as a fine writer says of Virgil in his Georgics) tosses about his Dung with an air of Majesty. If we consider that the exercises of his Authors could with justice to be no higher than tickling, chattering, braying, or diving, it was no easy matter to invent such games as were proportioned to the meaner degree of Booksellers. In Homer and Virgil, Ajax and Nisus the persons drawn in this plight are Heroes; whereas here they are such with whom it had been great impropriety to have joined any but vile ideas; besides the natural connection there is between Libellers and common Nusances. Nevertheless I have heard our author own, that this part of his Poem was (as it frequently happens) what cost him most trouble and pleased him least; but that he hoped it was excusable, since levelled at such as understand no delicate satyr: Thus the politest men are sometimes oliged to swear, when they happen to have to do with porters and oyster-wenches.Obscene with filth the miscreant lies bewray'd, Fal'n in the plash his wickedness had laid: Then first (if Poets aught of truth declare) The caitiff Vaticide conceiv'd a pray'r. Hear Jove! whose name my bards and I adore, As much at least as any God's, or more; And him and his, if more devotion warms, Remarks. Ver. 82.

To me this instance seems unluckily chosen; if it be a satyr on any body, it must be on a bad paymaster, since the person to whom they have here applied it, was a man of fortune. Not but poets may well be jealous of so great a prerogative as non-payment; which Mr. Dennis so far asserts, as boldly to pronounce that “if Homer himself was not in debt, it was because nobody would trust him.” Pref. to Rem. on the Rape of the Lock, p. 15.That suit an unpay'd taylor snatch'd away.

Breval, Bond, Besaleel,] I foresee it will be objected from this line, that we were in an error in our assertion on ver. 50. of this book, that More was a fictitious name, since these persons are equally represented by the poet as phantoms. So at first sight it may seem; but be not deceived, reader; these also are not real persons. 'Tis true, Curl declares Breval, a captain, author of a piece called The Confederates; but the same Curl first said it was written by Joseph Gay: Is his second assertion to be credited any more than his first? He likewise affirms Bond to be one who writ a satyr on our poet: But where is such a satyr to be found? where was such a writer ever heard of? As for Besaleel, it carries forgery in the very name; nor is it, as the others are, a surname. Thou may'st depend upon it, no such authors ever lived: all phantoms.

Ver. 138. Cook shall be Prior,] The man here specified writ a thing called The Battle of Poets, in which Philips and Welsted were the Heroes, and Swift and Pope utterly routed. He also published some malevolent things in the British, London, and Daily Journals; and at the same time wrote letters to Mr. Pope, protesting his innocence. His chief work was a translation of Hesiod, to which Theobald writ notes and half-notes, which he carefully owned.Cook shall be Prior, Remarks. Ver. 138. and Concanen, Swift:] In the first edition of this poem there were only asterisks in this place, but the names were since inserted, merely to fill up the verse, and give ease to the ear of the reader. and Concanen, Swift: So shall each hostile name become our own, Remarks. Ver. 140. And we too boast our Garth and Addison.] Nothing is more remarkable than our author's love of praising good writers. He has in this very poem celebrated Mr. Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Barrow, Dr. Atterbury, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Congreve, Dr. Garth, Mr. Addison; in a word, almost every man of his time that deserved it; even Cibber himself (presuming him to be author of the Careless Husband.) It was very difficult to have that pleasure in a poem on this subject, yet he has found means to insert their panegyric, and has made even Dulness out of her own mouth pronounce it. It must have been particularly agreeable to him to celebrate Dr. Garth; both as his constant friend, and as he was his predecessor in this kind of satyr. The Dispensary attacked the whole body of Apothecaries, a much more useful one undoubtedly than that of the bad Poets; if in truth this can be a body, of which no two members ever agreed. It also did what Mr. Theobald says is unpardonable, drew in parts of private character, and introduced persons independent of his subject. Much more would Boileau have incurred his censure, who left all subjects whatever, on all occasions, to fall upon the bad poets (which, it is to be feared, would have been more immediately his concern.) But certainly next to commending good writers, the greatest service to learning is to expose the bad, who can only that way be made of any use to it. This truth is very well set forth in these lines addressed to our author: The craven Rook, and pert Jackdaw, (Tho' neither birds of moral kind) Yet serve, if hang'd, or stuff'd with straw, To shew us which way blows the wind. Thus dirty knaves, or chatt'ring fools, Strung up by dozens in thy lay, Teach more by half than Dennis' rules, And point instruction every way. With Ægypt's art thy pen may strive, One potent drop let this but shed, And ev'ry Rogue that stunk alive, Becomes a precious Mummy dead.And we too boast our Garth and Addison. Imitations. Ver. 141, 142. ? piteous of his case, Yet smiling at his rueful length of face.)] ? Risit pater optimus illi. ? Me liceat casum miserere insontis amici ?

Ver. 142. rueful length of face)] “The decrepid person or figure of a man are no reflections upon his Genius: An honest mind will love and esteem a man of worth, though he be deformed or poor. Yet the author of the Dunciad hath libelled a person for his rueful length of face!” Mist's Journal, June 8. This Genius and man of worth, whom an honest mind should love, is Mr. Curl. True it is, he stood in the Pillory, an incident which will lengthen the face of any man tho' it were ever so comely, therefore is no reflection on the natural beauty of Mr. Curl. But as to reflections on any man's face, or figure, Mr. Dennis saith excellently; “Natural deformity comes not by our fault; 'tis often occasioned by calamities and diseases, which a man can no more help than a monster can his deformity. There is no one misfortune, and no one disease, but what all the rest of mankind are subject to. —But the deformity of this Author is visible, present, lasting, unalterable, and peculiar to himself. 'Tis the mark of God and Nature upon him, to give us warning that we should hold no society with him, as a creature not of our original, nor of our species: and they who have refused to take this warning which God and nature have given them, and have in spite of it by a senseless presumption ventured to be familiar with him, have severely suffered, &amp;c. 'Tis certain his original is not from Adam, but from the Devil,” &amp;c. Dennis, Charact. of Mr. P. octavo, 1716. Admirably it is observed by Mr. Dennis against Mr. Law, p. 33. “That the language of Billingsgate can never be the language of charity, nor consequently of Christianity.” I should else be tempted to use the language of a Critic; for what is more provoking to a commentator, than to behold his author thus portrayed? Yet I consider it really hurts not him; whereas to call some others dull, might do them prejudice with a world too apt to believe it: Therefore, though Mr. D. may call another a little ass or a young toad, far be it from us to call him a toothless lion or an old serpent. Indeed, had I written these notes (as was once my intent) in the learned language, I might have given him the appellations of balatro, calceatum caput, scurra in triviis, being phrases in good esteem and frequent usage among the best learned: But in our mother-tongue, were I to tax any gentleman of the Dunciad, surely it should be in words not to the vulgar intelligible; whereby christian charity, decency, and good accord among authors, might be preserved. Scribl. The good Scriblerus here, as on all occasions, eminently shews his humanity. But it was far otherwise with the gentlemen of the Dunciad, whose scurrilities were always personal, and of that nature which provoked every honest man but Mr. Pope; yet never to be lamented, since they occasioned the following amiable Verses: While Malice, Pope, denies thy page Its own celestial fire, While Critics, and while Bards in rage, Admiring, won't admire: While wayward pens thy worth assail, And envious tongues decry; These times tho' many a Friend bewail, These times bewail not I. But when the World's loud praise is thine, And spleen no more shall blame, When with thy Homer thou shalt shine In one establish'd fame: When none shall rail, and ev'ry lay Devote a wreathe to thee; That day (for come it will) that day Shall I lament to see.Yet smiling at his rueful length of face) Remarks.

On Codrus' old, or Dunton's modern bed;] Of Codrus the poet's bed, see Juvenal, describing his poverty very copiously, Sat. iii. ver. 103, &amp;c. Lectus erat Codro, &amp;c. Codrus had but one bed, so short to boot, That his short Wife's short legs hung dangling out. His cupboard's head six earthen pitchers grac'd, Beneath them was his trusty tankard plac'd; And to support this noble plate, there lay A bending Chiron, cast from honest clay. His few Greek books a rotten chest contain'd, Whose covers much of mouldiness complain'd, Where mice and rats devour'd poetic bread, And on heroic verse luxuriously were fed. 'Tis true poor Codrus nothing had to boast, And yet poor Codrus all that nothing lost. Dryden. But Mr. Concanen, in his dedication of the letters, advertisements, &amp;c. to the author of the Dunciad, assures us that “Juvenal never satyrized the Poverty of Codrus.” John Dunton was a broken bookseller and abusive scribler; he writ Neck or Nothing, a violent satyr on some ministers of state; a libel on the Duke of Devonshire and the Bishop of Peterborough, &amp;c.On Codrus' old, or Dunton's modern bed; Instructive work! whose wry-mouth'd portraiture Display'd the fates her confessors endure.

See in the circle next, Eliza plac'd,] In this game is exposed, in the most contemptuous manner, the profligate licentiousness of those shameless scriblers (for the most part of that Sex, which ought least to be capable of such malice or impudence) who in libellous Memoirs and Novels, reveal the faults or misfortunes of both sexes, to the ruin of public fame, or disturbance of private happiness. Our good poet (by the whole cast of his work being obliged not to take off the Irony) where he could not shew his indignation, hath shewn his contempt, as much as possible; having here drawn as vile a picture as could be represented in the colours of Epic poesy. Scribl. Ibid. Eliza Haywood; this woman was authoress of those most scandalous books called the court of Carimania, and the New Utopia. For the two babes of love, see Curl, Key, p. 22. But whatever reflection he is pleased to throw upon this Lady, surely it was what from him she little deserved, who had celebrated Curl's undertakings for Reformation of manners, and declared herself “to be so perfectly acquainted with the sweetness of his disposition, and that tenderness with which he considered the errors of his fellow creatures; that, though she should find the little inadvertencies of her own life recorded in his papers, she was certain it would be done in such a manner as she could not but approve.” Mrs. Haywood, Hist. of Clar. printed in the Female Dunciad, p. 18.See in the circle next, Eliza plac'd, Imitations.

Mrs. H. is here treated with distinction, and acknowledged to be the more valuable of the two.“This China Jordan let the chief o'ercome “Replenish, not ingloriously, at home.” Remarks. Ver. 167. Osborne] A Bookseller in Grays-Inn, very well qualified by his impudence to act this part; and therefore placed here instead of a less deserving Predecessor. This man published advertisements for a year together, pretending to sell Mr. Pope's Subscription books of Homer's Iliad at half the price: Of which books he had none, but cut to the size of them (which was Quarto) the common books in folio, without Copper-plates, on a worse paper, and never above half the value. Upon this Advertisement the Gazetteer harangued thus, July 6, 1739. “How melancholy must it be to a Writer to be so unhappy as to see his works hawked for sale in a manner so fatal to his fame! How, with Honour to your self, and Justice to your Subscribers, can this be done? What an Ingratitude to be charged on the Only honest Poet that lived in 1738! and than whom Virtue has not had a shriller Trumpeter for many ages! That you were once generally admired and esteemed can be denied by none; but that you and your works are now despised, is verified by this fact:” which being utterly false, did not indeed much humble the Author, but drew this just chastisement on the Bookseller.Osborne and Curl accept the glorious strife, (Tho' this his Son dissuades, and that his Wife.)

Ver. 183. Thro' half the heav'ns he pours th'exalted urn;] In a manuscript Dunciad (where are some marginal corrections of some gentlemen some time deceased) I have found another reading of these lines, thus, And lifts his urn, thro' half the heav'ns to flow; His rapid waters in their passage glow. This I cannot but think the right: For first, though the difference between burn and glow may seem not very material to others, to me I confess the latter has an elegance, a je ne sçay quoy, which is much easier to be conceived than explained. Secondly, every reader of our poet must have observed how frequently he uses this word glow in other parts of his works: To instance only in his Homer: (1.) Iliad. ix. v 726.—With one resentment glows. (2.) Iliad. xi. v 626.—There the battle glows. (3.) Ibid. v 985.—The closing flesh that instant ceas'd to glow. (4.) Iliad. xii. v 45.—Encompass'd Hector glows. (5.) Ibid. v 475.—His beating breast with gen'rous ardour glows. (6.) Iliad. xviii. v 591.—Another part glow'd with refulgent arms. (7.) Ibid. v 654.—And curl'd on silver props in order glow. I am afraid of growing too luxuriant in examples, or I could stretch this catalogue to a great extent, but these are enough to prove his fondness for this beautiful word, which, therefore, let all future editions replace here. I am aware, after all, that burn is the proper word to convey an idea of what was said to be Mr. Curl's condition at this time: But from that very reason I infer the direct contrary. For surely every lover of our author will conclude he had more humanity than to insult a man on such a misfortune or calamity, which could never befal him purely by his own fault, but from an unhappy communication with another. This Note is half Mr. Theobald, half Scribl. Imitations. Et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu, Eridanus, quo non alius per pinguia culta In mare purpureum violentior effluit amnis.

Swift as it mounts, all follow with their eyes: Still happy Impudence obtains the prize. Remarks. Ver. 187. The high-wrought day,] Some affirm, this was originally, well p?st day; but the Poet's decency would not suffer it. Here the learned Scriblerus manifests great anger; he exclaims against all such Conjectural Emendations in this manner: “Let it suffice, O Pallas! that every noble Ancient, Greek or Roman, hath suffered the impertinent correction of every Dutch, German, and Switz Schoolmaster! Let our English at least escape, whose intrinsic is scarce of marble so solid, as not to be impaired or soiled by such rude and dirty hands. Suffer them to call their works their own, and after death at least to find rest and sanctuary from Critics! When these men have ceased to rail, let them not begin to do worse, to comment! Let them not conjecture into nonsense, correct out of all correctness, and restore into obscurity and confusion. Miserable fate! which can befal only the sprightliest wits that have written, and will befal them only from such dull ones as could never write!” Scribl.Thou triumph'st, Victor of the high-wrought day, And the pleas'd dame, soft-smiling, lead'st away. Osborne, thro' perfect modesty o'ercome, Crown'd with the Jordan, walks contented home. But now for Authors nobler palms remain; Room for my Lord! three jockeys in his train; Six huntsmen with a shout precede his chair: He grins, and looks broad nonsense with a stare. His Honour's meaning Dulness thus exprest, “He wins this Patron, who can tickle best.” He chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state: With ready quills the Dedicators wait; Now at his head the dextrous task commence, And, instant, fancy feels th'imputed sense; Now gentle touches wanton o'er his face, He struts Adonis, and affects grimace: Remarks. Ver. 203. Paolo Antonio Rolli, an Italian Poet, and writer of many Operas in that language, which, partly by the help of his genius, prevailed in England near twenty years. He taught Italian to some fine Gentlemen, who affected to direct the Operas.Rolli the feather to his ear conveys, Then his nice taste directs our Operas: Remarks. Ver. 205. Bentley his mouth, &amp;c. Not spoken of the famous Dr. Richard Bentley, but of one Thom. Bentley, a small critic, who aped his uncle in a little Horace. The great one was intended to be dedicated to the Lord Hallifax, but (on a change of the Ministry) was given to the Earl of Oxford; for which reason the little one was dedicated to his son the Lord Harley. A taste of this Classic Elocution may be seen in his following Panegyric on the Peace of Utrecht. Cupimus Patrem tuum, fulgentissimum illud Orbis Anglicani jubar, adorare. O ingens Reipublicæ; nostræ columen! O fortunatam tanto Heroe Britanniam! Illi tali tantoque viro Deum per Omnia adfuisse, manumque ejus &amp; mentem direxisse, Certissimum est. Hujus enim Unius ferme opera, æquissimis &amp; perhonorificis conditionibus, diuturno, heu nimium! bello, finem impositum videmus. O Diem æterna memoria dignissimam! qua terrores Patriæ omnes excidit, Pacemque diu exoptatam toti fere Europæ restituit, ille Populi Anglicani Amor, Harleius. Thus critically (that is verbally) translated: “Thy Father, that most refulgent star of the Anglican Orb, we much desire to adore! Oh mighty Column of our Republic! Oh Britain, fortunate in such an Hero! That to such and so great a Man God was ever present, in every thing, and all along directed both his hand and his heart, is a Most Absolute Certainty! For it is in a manner by the operation of this. Man alone, that we behold a War (alas! how much too long an one!) brought at length to an end, on the most just and most honourable Conditions. Oh Day eternally to be memorated! wherein All the Terrors of his Country were ended, and a Peace (long wish'd for by almost all Europe) was restored by Harley, the Love and Delight of the People of England.” But that this Gentleman can write in a different style, may be seen in a letter he printed to Mr. Pope, wherein several Noble Lords are treated in a most extraordinary language, particularly the Lord Bolingbroke abused for that very Peace which he here makes the single work of the Earl of Oxford, directed by God Almighty.Bentley his mouth with classic flatt'ry opes, And the puff'd orator bursts out in tropes. Remarks. Ver. 207. Welsted] Leonard Welsted, author of The Triumvirate, or a Letter in verse from Palæmon to Celia at Bath, which was meant for a satyr on Mr. P. and some of his friends, about the year 1718. He writ other things which we cannot remember. Smedley in his Metamorphosis of Scriblerus, mentions one, the Hymn of a Gentleman to his Creator: And there was another in praise either of a Cellar, or a Garret. L. W. characterized in the treatise ???? ??????, or the Art of Sinking, as a Didapper, and after as an Eel, is said to be this person, by Dennis, Daily Journal of May 11, 1728. He was also characterized under another animal, a Mole, by the author of the ensuing Simile, which was handed about at the same time: Dear Welsted, mark, in dirty hole, That painful animal, a Mole: Above ground never born to grow; What mighty stir it keeps below? To make a Mole-hill all this strife! It digs, pokes, undermines for life. How proud a little dirt to spread; Conscious of nothing o'er its head! 'Till, lab'ring on for want of eyes, It blunders into Light—and dies. You have him again in book 3. ver. 169.But Welsted most the Poet's healing balm Strives to extract from his soft, giving palm; Unlucky Welsted! thy unfeeling master, The more thou ticklest, gripes his fist the faster.

A youth unknown to Phœbus, &amp;c.] The satyr of this Episode being levelled at the base flatteries of authors to worthless wealth or greatness, concludes here with an excellent lesson to such men: That altho' their pens and praises were as exquisite as they conceit of themselves, yet (even in their own mercenary views) a creature unlettered, who serveth the passions, or pimpeth to the pleasures, of such vain, braggart, puft Nobility, shall with those patrons be much more inward, and of them much higher rewarded.

Whether Mr. Dennis was the inventor of that improvement, I know not; but it is certain, that being once at a Tragedy of a new author, he fell into a great passion at hearing some, and cried, “'Sdeath! that is my Thunder.”With Thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl, With horns and trumpets now to madness swell, Remarks.

This thought the only means of advancing Christianity was by the New-birth of religious madness; That, by the old death of fire and faggot: And therefore they agreed in this, though in no other earthly thing, to abuse all the sober Clergy. From the small success of these two extraordinary persons, we may learn how little hurtful Bigotry and Enthusiasm are, while the Civil Magistrate prudently forbears to lend his power to the one, in order to the employing it against the other.There Webster! peal'd thy voice, and Whitfield! thine.

All hail him victor in both gifts of song, Remarks. Ver. 268. Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long.] A just character of Sir Richard Blackmore knight, who (as Mr. Dryden expresseth it) Writ to the rumbling of his coach's wheels. and whose indefatigable Muse produced no less than six Epic poems: Prince and King Arthur, twenty books; Eliza, ten; Alfred, twelve; the Redeemer, six; besides Job, in folio; the whole Book of Psalms; the Creation, seven books; Nature of Man, three books; and many more. 'Tis in this sense he is styled afterwards the everlasting Balckmore. Notwithstanding all which, Mr. Gildon seems assured, that “this admirable author did not think himself upon the same foot with Homer.” Comp. Art of Poetry, vol. i. p. 108. But how different is the judgment of the author of Characters of the times? p. 25. who says, “Sir Richard Blackmore is unfortunate in happening to mistake his proper talents; and that he has not for many years been so much as named, or even thought of among writers.” Even Mr. Dennis differs greatly from his friend Mr. Gildon: “Blackmore's Action (saith he) has neither unity, nor integrity, nor morality, nor universality; and consequently he can have no Fable, and no Heroic Poem: His Narration is neither probable, delightful, nor wonderful; his Characters have none of the necessary qualifications; the things contained in his Narration are neither in their own nature delightful, nor numerous enough, nor rightly disposed, nor surprising, nor pathetic.”—Nay he proceeds so far as to say Sir Richard has no Genius; first laying down, that “Genius is caused by a furious joy and pride of soul, on the conception of an extraordinary Hint. Many Men (says he) have their Hints, without these motions of fury and pride of soul, because they want fire enough to agitate their spirits; and these we call cold writers. Others who have a great deal of fire, but have not excellent organs, feel the forementioned motions, without the extraordinary hints; and these we call fustian writers. But he declares that Sir Richard had neither the Hints, nor the Motions.” Remarks on Pr. Arth. octavo, 1696. Preface. This gentleman in his first works abused the character of Mr. Dryden; and in his last, of Mr. Pope, accusing him in very high and sober terms of profaneness and immorality (Essay on Polite Writing, vol. ii. p. 270.) on a mere report from Edm. Curl, that he was author of a Travestie on the first Psalm. Mr. Dennis took up the same report, but with the addition of what Sir Richard had neglected, an Argument to prove it; which being very curious, we shall here transcribe. “It was he who burlesqued the the Psalm of David. It is apparent to me that Psalm was burlesqued by a Popish rhymester. Let rhyming persons who have been brought up Protestants be otherwise what they will, let them be rakes, let them be scoundrels, let them be Atheists, yet education has made an invincible impression on them in behalf of the sacred writings. But a Popish rhymester has been brought up with a contempt for those sacred writings; now shew me another Popish rhymester but he.” This manner of argumentation is usual with Mr. Dennis; he has employed the same against Sir Richard himself, in a like charge of Impiety and Irreligion. “All Mr. Blackmore's celestial Machines, as they cannot be defended so much as by common received opinion, so are they directly contrary to the doctrine of the church of England; for the visible descent of an Angel must be a miracle. Now it is the doctrine of the Church of England that miracles had ceased a long time before Prince Arthur came into world. Now if the doctrine of the church of England be true, as we are obliged to believe, then are all the celestial machines in Prince Arthur unsufferable, as wanting not only human, but divine probability. But if the machines are sufferable, that is if they have so much as divine probability, then it follows of necessity that the doctrine of the Church is false. So I leave it to every impartial Clergyman to consider,” &amp;c. Preface to the Remarks on Prince Arthur.Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long.

Ver. 280. the Weekly Journals] Papers of news and scandal intermixed, on different sides and parties, and frequently shifting from one side to the other, called the London Journal, British Journal, Daily Journal, &amp;c. the concealed writers of which for some time were Oldmixon, Roome, Arnall, Concanen, and others; persons never seen by our author.“The stream, be his the Weekly Journals bound, “A pig of lead to him who dives the best; Remarks. Ver. 282. “A peck of coals a-piece] Our indulgent Poet, whenever he has spoken of any dirty or low work, constantly puts us in mind of the Poverty of the offenders, as the only extenuation of such practices. Let any one but remark, when a Thief, a Pick-pocket, an Highwayman, or a Knight of the post are spoken of, how much our hate to those characters is lessened, if they add a needy Thief, a poor Pick-pocket, an hungry Highwayman, a starving Knight of the post, &amp;c.“A peck of coals a-piece shall glad the rest.” Remarks. Ver. 283. In naked majesty Oldmixon stands,] Mr. John Oldmixon, next to Mr. Dennis, the most ancient Critic of our Nation; an unjust censurer of Mr. Addison in his prose Essay on Criticism, whom also in his imitation of Bouhours (called the Arts of Logic and Rhetoric) he misrepresents in plain matter of fact; for in p. 45. he cites the Spectator as abusing Dr. Swift by name, where there is not the least hint of it; and in p. 304. is so injurious as to suggest, that Mr. Addison himself writ that Tatler, N. 43. which says of his own Simile, that “'Tis as great as ever entered into the mind of man. In Poetry he was not so happy as laborious, and therefore characterised by the Tatler, N. 62. by the name of Omicron the Unborn Poet.” Curl, Key, p. 13. “He writ Dramatic works, and a volume of Poetry, consisting of heroic Epistles, &amp;c. some whereof are very well done,” faith that great Judge Mr. Jacob, in his Lives of Poets, vol. ii. p. 303. In his Essay on Criticism, and the Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, he frequently reflects on our Author. But the top of his character was a Perverter of History, in that scandalous one of the Stuarts, in folio, and his Critical History of England, two volumes, octavo. Being employed by bishop Kennet, in publishing the Historians in his Collection, he falsified Daniel's Chronicle in numberless places. Yet this very man, in the preface to the first of these books, advanced a particular Fact to charge three eminent persons of falsifying the lord Clarendon's History; which fact has been disproved by Dr. Atterbury, late bishop of Rochester, then the only survivor of them; and the particular part he pretended to be falsified, produced since, after almost ninety years, in that noble author's original manuscript. He was all his life a virulent Party-writer for hire, and received his reward in a small place, which he enjoyed to his death. He is here likened to Milo, in allusion to that verse of Ovid, ? Fletque Milon senior, cum spectat inanes Herculeis similes, fluidos pendere lacertos; either with regard to his Age, or because he was undone by trying to pull to pieces an Oak that was too strong for him. ? Remember Milo's end Wedg'd in that timber which he strove to rend. Lord Rosc.In naked majesty Oldmixon stands, And Milo-like surveys his arms and hands; Then sighing, thus, “And am I now three-score? Remarks. Ver. 286. “Ah why, ye Gods! should two and two make four?”] Very reasonably doth this ancient Critic complain: Without doubt it was a fault in the Constitution of things. For the World, as a great writer saith, being given to man for a subject of disputation, he might think himself mock'd with a penurious gift, were any thing made certain. Hence those superior masters of wisdom, the Sceptics and Academics, reasonably conclude that two and two do not make four. Scribl. But we need not go so far, to remark what the Poet principally intended, the absurdity of complaining of old age, which must necessarily happen, as long as we are indulged in our desires of adding one year to another.“Ah why, ye Gods! should two and two make four?” He said, and clim'd a stranded lighter's height, Shot to the black abyss, and plung'd down-right. The Senior's judgment all the crowd admire, Who but to sink the deeper, rose the higher. Remarks. Ver. 291. Next Smedley div'd;] The person here mentioned, an Irishman, was author and publisher of many scurrilous pieces, a weekly Whitehall Journal, in the year 1722. in the name of Sir James Baker; and particularly whole volumes of Billingsgate against Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope, called Gulliveriana and Alexandriana, printed in octavo, 1728.Next Smedley div'd; slow circles dimpled o'er The quaking mud, that clos'd, and op'd no more.

Then ? essay'd;] A Gentleman of genius and spirit, who was secretly dipt in some papers of this kind, on whom our Poet bestows a panegyric instead of a satyr, as deserving to be better employed than in Party-quarrels and personal invectives.Then ? essay'd; scarce vanish'd out of sight, He buoys up instant, and returns to light: He bears no token of the sabler streams, And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames. Remarks. Ver. 299. Concanen] Matthew Concanen, an Irishman, bred to the law. Smedley (one of his brethren in enmity to Swift) in his Metamorphosis of Scriblerus, p. 7. accuses him of “having boasted of what he had not written, but others had revised and done for him.” He was author of several dull and dead scurrilities in the British and London Journals, and in a paper called the Speculatist. In a pamphlet, called a Supplement to the Profund, he dealt very unfairly with our Poet, not only frequently imputing to him Mr. Broome's verses (for which he might indeed seem in some degree accountable, having corrected what that gentleman did) but those of the duke of Buckingham, and others: To this rare piece somebody humourously caused him to take for his motto, De profundis clamavi. He was since a hired scribler in the Daily Courant, where he poured forth much Billingsgate against the lord Bolingbroke, and others; after which this man was surprisingly promoted to administer Justice and Law in Jamaica.True to the bottom, see Concanen creep, A cold, long-winded, native of the deep: If perseverance gain the Diver's prize, Imitations.

And Monumental Brass this record bears, Remarks. Ver. 314. Gazetteers] We ought not to suppress that a modern Critic here taxeth the Poet with an Anachronism, affirming these Gazetteers not to have lived within the time of his poem, and challenging us to produce any such paper of that date. But we may with equal assurance assert, these Gazetteers not to have lived since, and challenge all the learned world to produce one such paper at this day. Surely therefore, where the point is so obscure, our author ought not to be censured too rashly. Scribl. Notwithstanding this affected ignorance of the good Scriblerus, the Daily Gazetteer was a title given very properly to certain papers, each of which lasted but a day. Into this, as a common sink, was received all the trash, which had been before dispersed in several Journals, and circulated at the public expence of the nation. The authors were the same obscure men; though sometimes relieved by occasional essays from Statesmen, Courtiers, Bishops, Deans, and Doctors. The meaner sort were rewarded with Money; others with Places or Benefices, from an hundred to a thousand a year. It appears from the Report of the Secret Committee for enquiring into the Conduct of R. Earl of O. “That no less than fifty-thousand, seventy-seven pounds, eighteen shillings, were paid to Authors and Printers of News-papers, such as Free-Britons, Daily-Courants, Corn-Cutter's Journals, Gazetteers, and other political papers, between Feb. 10, 1731. and Feb. 10, 1741.” Which shews the Benevolence of One Minister to have expended, for the current dulness of ten years in Britain, double the sum which gained Louis XIV. so much honour, in annual Pensions to Learned men all over Europe. In which, and in a much longer time, not a Pension at Court, nor Preferment in the Church or Universities, of any Consideration, was bestowed on any man distinguished for his Learning separately from Party-merit, or Pamphlet-writing. It is worth a reflection, that of all the Panegyrics bestowed by these writers on this great Minister, not one is at this day extant or remembred; nor even so much credit done to his Personal character by all they have written, as by one short occasional compliment of our Author. Seen him I have; but in his happier hour Of social pleasure, ill exchang'd for Pow'r! Seen him, uncumber'd by the Venal Tribe, Smile without Art, and win without a Bribe.“These are,—ah no! these were, the Gazetteers!” Not so bold Arnall; with a weight of skull, Furious he dives, precipitately dull. Remarks. Ver. 317. Arnall;] William Arnall, bred an Attorney, was a perfect Genius in this sort of work. He began under twenty with furious Party-papers; then succeeded Concanen in the British Journal. At the first publication of the Dunciad, he prevailed on the Author not to give him his due place in it, by a letter professing his detestation of such practices as his Predecessor's. But since, by the most unexampled insolence, and personal abuse of several great men, the Poet's particular friends, he most amply deserved a niche in the Temple of Infamy: Witness a paper, called the Free Briton, a Dedication intituled To the Genuine Blunderer, 1732, and many others. He writ for hire, and valued himself upon it; not indeed without cause, it appearing by the aforesaid Report, that he received “for Free Britons, and other writings, in the space of four years, no less than ten thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven pounds, six shillings, and eight pence, out of the Treasury.”Whirlpools and storms his circling arm invest, With all the might of gravitation blest. No crab more active in the dirty dance, Downward to climb, and backward to advance. He brings up half the bottom on his head, And loudly claims the Journals and the Lead. The plunging Prelate, and his pond'rous Grace, With holy envy gave one Layman place. When lo! a burst of thunder shook the flood. Slow rose a form, in majesty of Mud; Shaking the horrors of his sable brows, And each ferocious feature grim with ooze. Imitations. Ver. 329. Greater he looks, and more than mortal stares;] Virg.

Remarks. Ver. 349. And Milbourn] Luke Milbourn a Clergyman, the fairest of Critics; who, when he wrote against Mr. Dryden's Virgil, did him justice in printing at the same time his own translations of him, which were intolerable. His manner of writing has a great resemblance with that of the Gentlemen of the Dunciad against our author, as will be seen in the Parallel of Mr. Dryden and him. AppendAnd Milbourn chief, deputed by the rest, Gave him the cassock, surcingle, and vest. “Receive (he said) these robes which once were mine, “Dulness is sacred in a sound divine.” He ceas'd, and spread the robe; the crowd confess The rev'rend Flamen in his lengthen'd dress. Remarks. Ver. 355. Around him wide, &amp;c. It is to be hoped that the satyr in these lines will be understood in the confined sense in which the Author meant it, of such only of the Clergy, who, tho' solemnly engaged in the service of Religion, dedicate themselves for venal and corrupt ends to that of Ministers or Factions; and tho' educated under an entire ignorance of the world, aspire to interfere in the government of it, and, consequently, to disturb and disorder it; in which they fall short only of their Predecessors, when invested with a larger share of power and authority, which they employed indifferently (as is hinted at in the lines above) either in supporting arbitrary power, or in exciting rebellion; in canonizing the vices of Tyrants, or in blackening the virtues of Patriots; in corrupting religion by superstition, or betraying it by libertinism, as either was thought best to serve the ends of Policy, or flatter the follies of the Great.Around him wide a sable Army stand, A low-born, cell-bred, selfish, servile band, Prompt or to guard or stab, to saint or damn, Heav'n's Swiss, who fight for any God, or Man. Remarks. Ver. 359. Lud's fam'd gates,] “King Lud repairing the City, called it, after his own name, Lud's Town; the strong gate which he built in the west part he likewise, for his own honour, named Ludgate. In the year 1260. this gate was beautified with images of Lud and other Kings. Those images in the reign of Edward VI. had their heads smitten off, and were otherwise defaced by unadvised folks. Queen Mary did set new heads upon their old bodies again. The 28th of Queen Elizabeth the same gate was clean taken down, and newly and beautifully builded, with images of Lud and others, as afore.” Stow's Survey of London.Thro' Lud's fam'd gates, along the well-known Fleet Rolls the black troop, and overshades the street, 'Till show'rs of Sermons, Characters, Essays, In circling fleeces whiten all the ways: So clouds replenish'd from some bog below, Mount in dark volumes, and descend in snow.

It is impossible to any one, who has a poetical ear, to read them without perceiving the heaviness that lags in the verse, to imitate the action it describes. The simile of the Pines is very just and well adapted to the subject;” says an Enemy, in his Essay on the Dunciad, p. 21.Thro' the long, heavy, painful page drawl on; Soft creeping, words on words, the sense compose, At ev'ry line they stretch, they yawn, they doze. As to soft gales top-heavy pines bow low Their heads, and lift them as they cease to blow: Thus oft they rear, and oft the head decline, As breathe, or pause, by fits, the airs divine. And now to this side, now to that they nod, As verse, or prose, infuse the drowzy God. Remarks. Ver. 397. Thrice Budgel aim'd to speak,] Famous for his speeches on many occasions about the South Sea scheme, &amp;c. “He is a very ingenious gentleman, and hath written some excellent Epilogues to Plays, and one small piece on Love, which is very pretty.” Jacob, Lives of Poets, vol. ii. p. 289. But this gentleman since made himself much more eminent, and personally well-known to the greatest Statesmen of all parties, as well as to all the Courts of Law in this nation.Thrice Budgel aim'd to speak, but thrice supprest By potent Arthur, knock'd his chin and breast.

Remarks. Ver. 405. As what a Dutchman, &amp;c.] It is a common and foolish mistake, that a ludicrous parody of a grave and celebrated passage is a ridicule of that passage. The reader therefore, if he will, may call this a parody of the author's own Similitude in the Essay on Man, Ep. iv. As the small pebble, &amp;c. but will any body therefore suspect the one to be a ridicule of the other? A ridicule indeed there is in every parody; but when the image is transferred from one subject to another, and the subject is not a poem burlesqued (which Scriblerus hopes the reader will distinguish from a burlesque poem) there the ridicule falls not on the thing imitated, but imitating. Thus, for instance, when Old Edward's armour beams on Cibber's breast, it is, without doubt, an object ridiculous enough. But I think it falls neither on old king Edward, nor his armour, but on his armour-bearer only. Let this be said to explain our Author's Parodies (a figure that has always a good effect in a mock epic poem) either from profane or sacred writers.As what a Dutchman plumps into the lakes, One circle first, and then a second makes; What Dulness dropt among her sons imprest Like motion from one circle to the rest; So from the mid-most the nutation spreads Imitations.

Boyer the State, and Law the Stage gave o'er,] A. Boyer, a voluminous compiler of Annals, Political Collections, &amp;c.—William Law A. M. wrote with great zeal against the Stage; Mr. Dennis answered with as great: Their books were printed in 1726. Mr. Law affirmed, that “The Playhouse is the temple of the Devil; the peculiar pleasure of the Devil; where all they who go, yield to the Devil; where all the laughter is a laughter among Devils; and all who are there are hearing Music in the very Porch of Hell.” To which Mr. Dennis replied, that “There is every jot as much difference between a true Play, and one made by a Poetaster, as between two religious books, the Bible and the Alcoran.” Then he demonstrates, that “All those who had written against the Stage were Jacobites and Non-jurors; and did it always at a time when something was to be done for the Pretender. Mr. Collier published his Short View when France declared for the Chevalier; and his Dissuasive, just at the great storm, when the devastation which that hurricane wrought, had amazed and astonished the minds of men, and made them obnoxious to melancholy and desponding thoughts. Mr. Law took the opportunity to attack the Stage upon the great preparations he heard were making abroad, and which the Jacobites flattered themselves were designed in their favour. And as for Mr. Bedford's Serious remonstrance, though I know nothing of the time of publishing it, yet I dare to lay odds it was either upon the Duke d'Aumont's being at Somerset-house, or upon the late Rebellion.” Dennis, Stage defended against Mr. Law, p. ult.Boyer the State, and Law the Stage gave o'er, Remarks. Ver. 414. Morgan] A writer against Religion, distinguished no otherwise from the rabble of his tribe than by the pompousness of his Title; for having stolen his Morality from Tindal, and his Philosophy from Spinoza, he calls himself, by the courtesy of England, a Moral Philosopher. Ibid. Mandevil] This writer, who prided himself as much in the reputation of an Immoral Philosopher, was author of a famous book called the Fable of the Bees; which may seem written to prove, that Moral Virtue is the invention of knaves, and Christian Virtue the imposition of fools; and that Vice is necessary, and alone sufficient to render Society flourishing and happy.Morgan and Mandevil could prate no more; Remarks.

Ver. 418. And all was hush'd, as Folly's self lay dead.] Alludes to Dryden's verse in the Indian Emperor; All things are hush'd, as Nature's self lay dead.And all was hush'd, as Folly's self lay dead. Thus the soft gifts of Sleep conclude the day, And stretch'd on bulks, as usual, Poets lay.

How Henley lay inspir'd beside a sink, Remarks. Ver. 426. And to mere mortals seem'd a Priest in drink;] This line presents us with an excellent moral, that we are never to pass judgment merely by appearances; a lesson to all men who may happen to see a reverend Person in the like situation, not to determine too rashly: since not only the Poets frequently describe a Bard inspired in this posture, (On Cam's fair bank, where Chaucer lay inspir'd, and the like) but an eminent Casuist tells us, that “if a Priest be seen in any indecent action, we ought to account it a deception of sight, or illusion of the Devil, who sometimes takes upon him the shape of holy men on purpose to cause scandal.” Scribl.And to mere mortals seem'd a Priest in drink: Remarks.

Book the Third. ARGUMENT. After the other persons are disposed in their proper places of rest, the Goddess transports the King to her Temple, and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap; a position of marvellous virtue, which causes all the Visions of wild enthusiasts, projectors, politicians, inamoratos, castle-builders, chemists, and poets. He is immediately carried on the wings of Fancy, and led by a mad Poetical Sibyl, to the Elysian shade; where, on the banks of Lethe, the souls of the dull are dipped by Bavius, before their entrance into this world. There he is met by the ghost of Settle, and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place, and with those which he himself is destined to perform. He takes him to a Mount of Vision, from whence he shews him the past triumphs of the Empire of Dulness, then the present, and lastly the future: how small a part of the world was ever conquered by Science, how soon those conquests were stopped, and those very nations again reduced to her dominion. Then distinguishing the Island of Great-Britain, shews by what aids, by what persons, and by what degrees it shall be brought to her Empire. Some of the persons he causes to pass in review before his eyes, describing each by his proper figure, character, and qualifications. On a sudden the Scene shifts, and a vast number of miracles and prodigies appear, utterly surprising and unknown to the King himself, 'till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing. On this Subject Settle breaks into a congratulation, yet not unmixed with concern, that his own times were but the types of these. He prophesies how first the nation shall be over-run with Farces, Operas, and Shows; how the throne of Dulness shall be advanced over the Theatres, and set up even at Court: then how her Sons shall preside in the seats of Arts and Sciences: giving a glimpse, or Pisgah-sight of the future Fulness of her Glory, the accomplishment whereof is the subject of the fourth and last book. But in her Temple's last recess inclos'd, On Dulness' lap th'Anointed head repos'd. Him close she curtains round with Vapours blue, And soft besprinkles with Cimmerian dew. Remarks. Ver. 5, 6, &amp;c. Hereby is intimated that the following Vision is no more than the chimera of the dreamer's brain, and not a real or intended satyr on the present Age, doubtless more learned, more enlightened, and more abounding with great Genius's in Divinity, Politics, and whatever arts and sciences, than all the preceding. For fear of any such mistake of our Poet's honest meaning, he hath again at the end of the Vision repeated this monition, saying that it all past through the Ivory gate, which (according to the Ancients) denoteth Falsity. Scribl. How much the good Scriblerus was mistaken, may be seen from the Fourth book, which, it is plain from hence, he had never seen. Bent.Then raptures high the seat of Sense o'erflow, Which only heads refin'd from Reason know. Imitations. Ver. 7, 8.

Æn. viii.Hence, from the straw where Bedlam's Prophet nods, He hears loud Oracles, and talks with Gods: Hence the Fool's Paradise, the Statesman's Scheme, The air-built Castle, and the golden Dream, The Maid's romantic wish, the Chemist's flame, And Poet's vision of eternal Fame. And now, on Fancy's easy wing convey'd, The King descending, views th'Elysian Shade. Remarks. Ver. 15. A slip-shod Sibyl] This allegory is extremely just, no conformation of the mind so much subjecting it to real Madness, as that which produces real Dulness. Hence we find the religious (as well as the poetical) Enthusiasts of all ages were ever, in their natural state, most heavy and lumpish; but on the least application of heat, they run like lead, which of all metals falls quickest into fusion. Whereas fire in a Genius is truly Promethean, it hurts not its constituent parts, but only fits it (as it does well-tempered steel) for the necessary impressions of art. But the common people have been taught (I do not know on what foundation) to regard Lunacy as a mark of Wit, just as the Turks and our modern Methodists do of Holiness. But if the cause of Madness assigned by a great Philosopher be true, it will unavoidably fall upon the dunces. He supposes it to be the dwelling over long on one object or idea: Now as this attention is occasioned either by Grief or Study, it will be fixed by Dulness; which hath not quickness enough to comprehend what it seeks, nor force and vigour enough to divert the imagination from the object it laments.A slip-shod Sibyl led his steps along, In lofty madness meditating song; Her tresses staring from Poetic dreams, And never wash'd, but in Castalia's streams. Remarks. Ver. 19. Taylor,] John Taylor the Water-poet, an honest man, who owns he learned not so much as the Accidence: A rare example of modesty in a Poet! I must confess I do want eloquence, And never scarce did learn my Accidence; For having got from possum to posset, I there was gravel'd, could no farther get. He wrote fourscore books in the reign of James I. and Charles I. and afterwards (like Edward Ward) kept an Alehouse in Long-Acre. He died in 1654.Taylor, their better Charon, lends an oar, (Once swan of Thames, tho' now he sings no more.) Remarks. Ver. 21. Benlowes,] A country gentleman, famous for his own bad Poetry, and for patronizing bad Poets, as may be seen from many Dedications of Quarles and others to him. Some of these anagram'd his name, Benlowes into Benevolus: to verify which, he spent his whole estate upon them.Benlowes, propitious still to blockheads, bows; Remarks. Ver. 22.

Old Bavius sits,] Bavius was an ancient Poet, celebrated by Virgil for the like cause as Bays by our author, though not in so christian-like a manner: For heathenishly it is declared by Virgil of Bavius, that he ought to be hated and detested for his evil works; Qui Bavium non odit; whereas we have often had occasion to observe our Poet's great Good nature and Mercifulness thro' the whole course of this Poem. Scribl. Mr. Dennis warmly contends, that Bavius was no inconsiderable author; nay, that “He and Mævius had (even in Augustus's days) a very formidable party at Rome, who thought them much superior to Virgil and Horace: For (saith he) I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit.” Rem. on Pr. Arthur, part ii. c. 1. An argument which, if this poem should last, will conduce to the honour of the gentlemen of the Dunciad. Imitations. Ver. 24.

Ward in Pillory.] John Ward of Hackney Esq. Member of Parliament, being convicted of forgery, was first expelled the House, and then sentenced to the Pillory on the 17th of February 1727. Mr. Curl (having likewise stood there) looks upon the mention of such a Gentleman in a satyr, as a great act of barbarity, Key to the Dunc. 3d edit. p. 16. And another author reasons thus upon it. Durgen. 8vo. p. 11, 12. “How unworthy is it of Christian Charity to animate the rabble to abuse a worthy man in such a situation? what could move the Poet thus to mention a brave sufferer, a gallant prisoner, exposed to the view of all mankind! It was laying aside his Senses, it was committing a Crime, for which the Law is deficient not to punish him! nay, a Crime which Man can scarce forgive, or Time efface! Nothing surely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great Lady, &amp;c.” (to whom this brave, honest, worthy Gentleman was guilty of no offence but Forgery, proved in open Court.) But it is evident this verse could not be meant of him; it being notorious, that no Eggs were thrown at that Gentleman. Perhaps therefore it might be intended of Mr. Edward Ward the Poet when he stood there.As thick as eggs at Ward in Pillory. Wond'ring he gaz'd: When lo! a Sage appears, Remarks. Ver. 36. And length of ears,] This is a sophisticated reading. I think I may venture to affirm all the Copyists are mistaken here: I believe I may say the same of the Critics; Dennis, Oldmixon, Welsted have passed it in silence. I have also stumbled at it, and wondered how an error so manifest could escape such accurate persons. I dare assert it proceeded originally from the inadvertency of some Transcriber, whose head run on the Pillory, mentioned two lines before; it is therefore amazing that Mr. Curl himself should over-look it! Yet that Scholiast takes not the least notice hereof. That the learned Mist also read it thus, is plain from his ranging this passage among those in which our author was blamed for personal Satyr on a Man's face (whereof doubtless he might take the ear to be a part;) so likewise Concanen, Ralph, the Flying Post, and all the herd of Commentators. —Tota armenta sequuntur. A very little sagacity (which all these Gentlemen therefore wanted) will restore us to the true sense of the Poet, thus, By his broad shoulders known, and length of years. See how easy a change; of one single letter! That Mr. Settle was old, is most certain; but he was (happily) a stranger to the Pillory. This note partly Mr. Theobald's, partly Scribl.By his broad shoulders known, and length of ears, Remarks. Ver. 37. Settle] Elkanah Settle was once a Writer in vogue, as well as Cibber, both for Dramatic Poetry and Politics. Mr. Dennis tells us that “he was a formidable rival to Mr. Dryden, and that in the University of Cambridge there were those who gave him the preference.” Mr. Welsted goes yet farther in his behalf: “Poor Settle was formerly the Mighty rival of Dryden; nay, for many years, bore his reputation above him.” Pref. to his Poems, 8vo. p. 31. And Mr. Milbourn cried out, “How little was Dryden able, even when his blood run high, to defend himself against Mr. Settle!” Notes on Dryd. Virg. p. 175. These are comfortable opinions! and no wonder some authors indulge them. He was author or publisher of many noted pamphlets in the time of king Charles II. He answered all Dryden's political poems; and being cried up on one side, succeeded not a little in his Tragedy of the Empress of Morocco (the first that was ever printed with Cuts.) “Upon this he grew insolent, the Wits writ against his Play, he replied, and the Town judged he had the better. In short, Settle was then thought a very formidable rival to Mr. Dryden; and not only the Town but the University of Cambridge was divided which to prefer; and in both places the younger sort inclined to Elkanah.” Dennis Pref. to Rem. on Hom.Known by the band and suit which Settle wore (His only suit) for twice three years before: All as the vest, appear'd the wearer's frame, Old in new state, another yet the same.

For this our Queen unfolds to vision true Thy mental eye, for thou hast much to view:] This has a resemblance to that passage in Milton, book xi. where the Angel To nobler sights from Adam's eye remov'd The film; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue The visual nerve—For he had much to see. There is a general allusion in what follows to that whole Episode.For this our Queen unfolds to vision true Thy mental eye, for thou hast much to view: Old scenes of glory, times long cast behind Shall, first recall'd, rush forward to thy mind: Then stretch thy sight o'er all her rising reign, And let the past and future fire thy brain. Remarks. Ver. 67. Ascend this hill, &amp;c.] The scenes of this vision are remarkable for the order of their appearance. First, from ver. 67 to 73. those places of the globe are shewn where Science never rose; then from ver. 73 to 83, those where she was destroyed by Tyranny; from ver. 85 to 95, by inundations of Barbarians; from ver. 96 to 106, by Superstition. Then Rome, the Mistress of Arts, described in her degeneracy; and lastly Britain, the scene of the action of the poem; which furnishes the occasion of drawing out the Progeny of Dulness in review.Ascend this hill, whose cloudy point commands Her boundless empire over seas and lands. Remarks. Ver. 69. See round the Poles, &amp;c.] Almost the whole Southern and Northern Continent wrapt in ignorance.See, round the Poles where keener spangles shine, Where spices smoke beneath the burning Line, (Earth's wide extremes) her sable flag display'd, And all the nations cover'd in her shade!

Ver. 102. thund'ring against heathen lore;] A strong instance of this pious rage is placed to Pope Gregory's account. John of Salisbury gives a very odd encomium of this Pope, at the same time that he mentions one of the strangest effects of this excess of zeal in him: Doctor sanctissimus ille Gregorius, qui melleo prædicationis imbre totam rigavit &amp; inebriavit ecclesiam; non modo Mathesin jussit ab aula, sed, ut traditur a majoribus, incendio dedit probatæ lectionis scripta, Palatinus quæcunque tenebat Apollo. And in another place: Fertur beatus Gregorius bibliothecam combussisse gentilem; quo divinæ paginæ gratior esset locus, &amp; major authoritas, et diligentia studiosior. Desiderius Archbishop of Vienna was sharply reproved by him for teaching Grammar and Literature, and explaining the Poets; because (says this Pope) In uno se ore cum Jovis laudibus Christi laudes non capiunt: Et quam grave nesandumque sit Episcopis canere quod nec Laico religioso conveniat, ipse considera. He is said, among the rest, to have burned Livy; Quia in superstitionibus et sacris Romanorum perpetuo versatur. The same Pope is accused by Vossius, and others, of having caused the noble monuments of the old Roman magnificence to be destroyed, lest those who came to Rome should give more attention to Triumphal Arches, &amp;c. than to holy things. Bayle, Dict.Of arts, but thund'ring against heathen lore; Her grey-hair'd Synods damning books unread, And Bacon trembling for his brazen head.

Ver. 109. 'Till Peter's keys some christ'ned Jove adorn,] After the government of Rome devolved to the Popes, their zeal was for some time exerted in demolishing the heathen Temples and Statues, so that the Goths scarce destroyed more monuments of Antiquity out of rage, than these out of devotion. At length they spared some of the Temples, by converting them to Churches; and some of the Statues, by modifying them into images of Saints. In much later times, it was thought necessary to change the statues of Apollo and Pallas, on the tomb of Sannazarius, into David and Judith; the Lyre easily became a Harp, and the Gorgon's head turned to that of Holofernes.'Till Peter's keys some christ'ned Jove adorn, And Pan to Moses lends his pagan horn; See graceless Venus to a Virgin turn'd, Or Phidias broken, and Apelles burn'd.

With all thy Father's virtues blest, be born!] A manner of expression used by Virgil, Ecl. viii. Nascere! præque diem veniens, age, Lucifer ? As also that of patriis virtutibus, Ecl. iv. It was very natural to shew to the Hero, before all others, his own Son, who had already begun to emulate him in his theatrical, poetical, and even political capacities. By the attitude in which he here presents himself, the reader may be cautioned against ascribing wholly to the Father the merit of the epithet Cibberian, which is equally to be understood with an eye to the Son.With all thy Father's virtues blest, be born! And a new Cibber shall the stage adorn. A second see, by meeker manners known, And modest as the maid that sips alone; Imitations. Ver. 145.

Jacob, the scourge of Grammar, mark with awe,] “This Gentleman is son of a considerable Maltster of Romsey in Southamptonshire, and bred to the Law under a very eminent Attorney: Who, between his more laborious studies, has diverted himself with Poetry. He is a great admirer of Poets and their works, which has occasion'd him to try his genius that way.—He has writ in prose the Lives of the Poets, Essays, and a great many Law-Books, The Accomplish'd Conveyancer, Modern Justice, &amp;c.” Giles Jacob of himself, Lives of Poets, vol. 1. He very grossly, and unprovok'd, abused in that book the Author's Friend, Mr. Gay. Remarks. Ver. 149, 150. Jacob, the scourge of Grammar, mark with awe; Nor less revere him, blunderbuss of Law.] There may seem some error in these verses, Mr. Jacob having proved our author to have a Respect for him, by this undeniable argument. “He had once a Regard for my Judgment; otherwise he would never have subscribed Two Guineas to me, for one small Book in octavo.” Jacob's Letter to Dennis, printed in Dennis's Remarks on the Dunciad, pag. 49. Therefore I should think the appellation of Blunderbuss to Mr. Jacob, like that of Thunderbolt to Scipio, was meant in his honour. Mr. Dennis argues the same way. “My writings having made great impression on the minds of all sensible men, Mr. P. repented, and to give proof of his Repentance, subscribed to my two volumes of select Works, and afterward to my two Volumes of Letters.” Ibid. pag. 80. We should hence believe, the Name of Mr. Dennis hath also crept into this poem by some mistake. But from hence, gentle reader! thou may'st beware, when thou givest thy money to such Authors, not to flatter thyself that my motives are Good-nature or Charity.Jacob, the scourge of Grammar, mark with awe, Imitations.

Horneck and Roome] These two were virulent Party-writers, worthily coupled together, and one would think prophetically, since, after the publishing of this piece, the former dying, the latter succeeded him in Honour and Employment. The first was Philip Horneck, Author of a Billingsgate paper call'd The High German Doctor. Edward Roome was son of an Undertaker for Funerals in Fleetstreet, and writ some of the papers call'd Pasquin, where by malicious Innuendos he endeavoured to represent our Author guilty of malevolent practices with a great man then under prosecution of Parliament. P?le was the author of some vile Plays and Pamphlets. He published abuses on our author in a Paper called the Prompter.Horneck's fierce eye, and Roome's funereal Frown. Remarks. Ver. 153.

Whose tuneful whistling makes the waters pass:] There were several successions of these sort of minor poets, at Tunbridge, Bath, &amp;c. singing the praise of the Annuals flourishing for that season; whose names indeed would be nameless, and therefore the Poet slurs them over with others in general.Whose tuneful whistling makes the waters pass: Each Songster, Riddler, ev'ry nameless name, All crowd, who foremost shall be damn'd to Fame. Some strain in rhyme; the Muses, on their racks, Scream like the winding of ten thousand jacks: Some free from rhyme or reason, rule or check, Break Priscian's head, and Pegasus's neck; Down, down they larum, with impetuous whirl, The Pindars, and the Miltons of a Curl. Remarks. Ver. 165. Ralph] James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions, not known to our author till he writ a swearing-piece called Sawney, very abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and himself. These lines allude to a thing of his, intitled, Night, a Poem: ? Visit thus the glimpses of the Moon, Making Night hideous ? Shakesp. This low writer attended his own works with panegyricks in the Journals, and once in particular praised himself highly above Mr. Addison, in wretched remarks upon that Author's Account of English Poets, printed in a London Journal, Sept. 1728. He ended at last in the common Sink of all such writers, a political News-paper, to which he was recommended by his friend Arnall, and received a small pittance for pay.Silence, ye Wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls, And makes Night hideous—Answer him, ye Owls! Sense, speech, and measure, living tongues and dead, Remarks. Ver. 168. Morris] Besaleel, see Book 2.Let all give way—and Morris may be read. Remarks. Ver. 169. Flow Welsted, &amp;c.] Of this Author see the Remark on Book 2. ver. 209. But (to be impartial) add to it the following different character of him: Mr. Welsted had, in his youth, rais'd so great expectations of his future genius, that there was a kind of struggle between the most eminent in the two Universities, which should have the honour of his education. To compound this, he (civilly) became a member of both, and after having pass'd some time at the one, he removed to the other. From thence he return'd to town, where he became the darling Expectation of all the polite Writers, whose encouragement he acknowledg'd in his occasional poems, in a manner that will make no small part of the Fame of his protectors. It also appears from his Works, that he was happy in the patronage of the most illustrious characters of the present age—Encourag'd by such a Combination in his favour, he—publish'd a book of poems, some in the Ovidian, some in the Horatian manner, in both which the most exquisite Judges pronounce he even rival'd his masters—His Love verses have rescued that way of writing from contempt—In his Translations, he has given us the very soul and spirit of his author. His Ode—his Epistle—his Verses—his Love tale—all, are the most perfect things in all poetry. Welsted of Himself, Char. of the Times, 8vo 1728. pag. 23, 24. It should not be forgot to his honour, that he received at one time the sum of 500 pounds for secret service, among the other excellent authors hired to write anonymously for the Ministry. See Report of the Secret Committee, &amp;c. in 1742. Imitations. Ver. 199. Flow Welsted, flow! &amp;c.] Parody on Denham, Cooper's Hill.

Remarks. Ver. 173. Ah Dennis, &amp;c.] The reader, who has seen thro' the course of these notes, what a constant attendance Mr. Dennis paid to our Author and all his works, may perhaps wonder he should be mention'd but twice, and so slightly touch'd, in this poem. But in truth he look'd upon him with some esteem, for having (more generously than all the rest) set his Name to such writings. He was also a very old man at this time. By his own account of himself in Mr. Jacob's Lives, he must have been above three-score, and happily lived many years after. So that he was senior to Mr. Durfey, who hitherto of all our Poets enjoy'd the longest Bodily life.Ah Dennis! Gildon ah! what ill-starr'd rage Divides a friendship long confirm'd by age?

Nor glad vile Poets with true Critics gore. Remarks. Ver. 179. Behold yon Pair, &amp;c.] One of these was Author of a weekly paper call'd The Grumbler, as the other was concerned in another call'd Pasquin, in which Mr. Pope was abused with the Duke of Buckingham and Bishop of Rochester. They also joined in a piece against his first undertaking to translate the Iliad, intitled Homerides, by Sir Iliad Doggrel, printed 1715. Of the other works of these Gentlemen the world has heard no more, than it would of Mr. Pope's, had their united laudable endeavours discourag'd him from pursuing his studies. How few good works had ever appear'd (since men of true merit are always the least presuming) had there been always such champions to stifle them in their conception? And were it not better for the publick, that a million of monsters should come into the world, which are sure to die as soon as born, than that the Serpents should strangle one Hercules in his Cradle? After many Editions of this poem, the Author thought fit to omit the names of these two persons, whose injury to him was of so old a date. In the verses he omitted, it was said that one of them had a pious passion for the other. It was a literal translation of Virgil, Nisus amore pio pueri—and there, as in the original, applied to Friendship: That between Nisus and Euryalus is allowed to make one of the most amiable Episodes in the world, and surely was never interpreted in a perverse sense. But it will astonish the reader to hear, that on no other occasion than this line, a Dedication was written to that Gentleman to induce him to think something further. “Sir, you are known to have all that affection for the beautiful part of the creation which God and Nature design'd.—Sir, you have a very fine Lady—and, Sir, you have eight very fine Children,”—&amp;c. [Dedic. to Dennis Rem. on the Rape of the Lock.] The truth is, the poor Dedicator's brain was turn'd upon this article: He had taken into his head, that ever since some books were written against the Stage, and since the Italian Opera had prevail'd, the nation was infected with a vice not fit to be nam'd: He went so far as to print upon the subject, and concludes his argument with this remark, “That he cannot help thinking the Obscenity of Plays excusable at this juncture; since, when that execrable sin is spread so wide, it may be of use to the reducing mens minds to the natural desire of women.” Dennis, Stage defended against Mr. Law, p. 20. Our author solemnly declared, he never heard any creature but the Dedicator mention that Vice and this Gentleman together. Imitations. Ver. 179. Behold yon Pair, in strict embraces join'd;] Virg.

Remarks. Ver. 187. arede] Read, or peruse; though sometimes used for counsel. “Reade thy read, take thy Counsaile. Thomas Sternhold, in his translation of the first Psalm into English metre, hath wisely made use of this word, The man is blest that hath not bent To wicked read his ear. But in the last spurious editions of the singing Psalms the word read is changed into men. I say spurious editions, because not only here, but quite throughout the whole book of Psalms, are strange alterations, all for the worse; and yet the Title-page stands as it used to do! and all (which is abominable in any book, much more in a sacred work) is ascribed to Thomas Sternhold, John Hopkins, and others; I am confident, were Sternhold and Hopkins now living they would proceed against the innovators as cheats. —A liberty, which, to say no more of their intolerable alterations, ought by no means to be permitted or approved of by such as are for Uniformity, and have any regard for the old English Saxon tongue.” Hearne, Gloss. on Rob. of Gloc. artic. Rede. I do herein agree with Mr. Hearne: Little is it of avail to object, that such words are become unintelligible; since they are truly English, men ought to understand them; and such as are for Uniformity should think all alterations in a language, strange, abominable, and unwarrantable. Rightly therefore, I say, again, hath our Poet used ancient words, and poured them forth as a precious ointment upon good old Wormius in this place. Scribl. Ibid. myster wight,] Uncouth mortal.Right well mine eyes arede the myster wight, Remarks. Ver. 188. Wormius hight.] Let not this name, purely fictitious, be conceited to mean the learned Olaus Wormius; much less (as it was unwarrantably foisted into the surreptitious editions) our own Antiquary Mr. Thomas Hearne, who had no way aggrieved our Poet, but on the contrary published many curious tracts which he hath to his great contentment perused. Most rightly are ancient Words here employed, in speaking of such who so greatly delight in the same. We may say not only rightly, but wisely, yea excellently, inasmuch as for the like practice the like praise is given by Mr. Hearne himself. Glossar. to Rob. of Glocester, Artic. Behett; “Others say behight, promised, and so it is used excellently well by Thomas Norton, in his translation into metre of the 116th Psalm, ver. 14.

Remarks. Ver. 188. In Cumberland they say to hight, for to promise, or vow; but hight, usually signifies was called; and so it does in the North even to this day, notwithstanding what is done in Cumberland.” Hearne, ibid.On parchment scraps y-fed, and Wormius hight.

Wits, who, like owls, &amp;c.] These few lines exactly describe the right verbal critic: The darker his author is, the better he is pleased; like the famous Quack Doctor, who put up in his bills, he delighted in matters of difficulty. Some body said well of these men, that their heads were Libraries out of order.Wits, who like owls, see only in the dark, A Lumberhouse of books in ev'ry head, For ever reading, never to be read! But, where each Science lifts its modern type, Hist'ry her Pot, Divinity her Pipe, While proud Philosophy repines to show, Dishonest sight! his breeches rent below; Remarks. Ver. 199. lo! Henley stands, &amp;c.] J. Henley the Orator; he preached on the Sundays upon Theological matters, and on the Wednesdays upon all other sciences. Each auditor paid one shilling. He declaimed some years against the greatest persons, and occasionally did our Author that honour. Welsted, in Oratory Transactions, N. 1. published by Henley himself, gives the following account of him. “He was born at Melton-Mowbray in Leicestershire. From his own Parish school he went to St. John's College in Cambridge. He began there to be uneasy; for it shock'd him to find he was commanded to believe against his own judgment in points of Religion, Philosophy, &amp;c. for his genius leading him freely to dispute all propositions, and call all points to account, he was impatient under those fetters of the free-born mind. —Being admitted to Priest's orders, he found the examination very short and superficial, and that it was not necessary to conform to the Christian religion, in order either to Deaconship, or Priesthood.” He came to town, and after having for some years been a writer for Booksellers, he had an ambition to be so for Ministers of state. The only reason he did not rise in the Church, we are told, “was the envy of others, and a disrelish entertained of him, because he was not qualified to be a compleat Spaniel.” However he offered the service of his pen to two great men, of opinions and interests directly opposite; by both of whom being rejected, he set up a new Project, and styled himself the Restorer of ancient eloquence. He thought “it as lawful to take a licence from the King and Parliament at one place, as another; at Hickes's-hall, as at Doctors-commons; so set up his Oratory in Newport-market, Butcher-row. There (says his friend) he had the assurance to form a Plan, which no mortal ever thought of; he had success against all opposition; challenged his adversaries to fair disputations, and none would dispute with him; writ, read, and studied twelve hours a day; composed three dissertations a week on all subjects; undertook to teach in one year what schools and Universities teach in five; was not terrified by menaces, insults, or satyrs, but still proceeded, matured his bold scheme, and put the Church, and all that, in danger.” Welsted, Narrative in Orat. Transact. N. 1. After having stood some Prosecutions, he turned his rhetoric to buffoonry upon all public and private occurrences. All this passed in the same room; where sometimes he broke jests, and sometimes that bread which he called the Primitive Eucharist. —This wonderful person struck Medals, which he dispersed as Tickets to his subscribers: The device, a Star rising to the meridian, with this motto, ad summa; and below, inveniam viam aut faciam. This man had an hundred pounds a year given him for the secret service of a weekly paper of unintelligible nonsense, called the Hyp-Doctor.Imbrown'd with native bronze, lo!

Yet oh, my sons! &amp;c.] The caution against Blasphemy here given by a departed Son of Dulness to his yet existing brethren, is, as the Poet rightly intimates, not out of tenderness to the ears of others, but their own. And so we see that when that danger is removed, on the open establishment of the Goddess in the fourth book, she encourages her sons, and they beg assistance to pollute the Source of Light itself, with the same virulence they had before done the purest emanations from it.Yet oh, my sons! a father's words attend: (So may the fates preserve the ears you lend) 'Tis yours, a Bacon or a Locke to blame, A Newton's genius, or a Milton's flame: But oh! with One, immortal one dispense, The source of Newton's Light, of Bacon's Sense! Content, each Emanation of his fires That beams on earth, each Virtue he inspires, Each Art he prompts, each Charm he can create, Whate'er he gives, are giv'n for you to hate.

Discite justitiam moniti, &amp; non temnere divos! Ibid. “not to scorn your God”] See this subject pursued in Book 4.But, “Learn, ye Dunces! not to scorn your God.” Thus he, for then a ray of Reason stole Half thro' the solid darkness of his soul; But soon the cloud return'd—and thus the Sire: See now, what Dulness and her sons admire! See what the charms, that smite the simple heart Not touch'd by Nature, and not reach'd by Art. His never-blushing head he turn'd aside, Remarks. Ver. 232. (Not half so pleas'd when Goodman prophesy'd)] Mr. Cibber tells us, in his Life, p. 149. that Goodman being at the rehearsal of a play, in which he had a part, clapped him on the shoulder, and cried, “If he does not make a good actor, I'll be d?d—And (says Mr. Cibber) I make it a question, whether Alexander himself, or Charles the twelfth of Sweden, when at the head of their first victorious armies, could feel a greater transport in their bosoms than I did in mine.”(Not half so pleas'd when Goodman prophesy'd) Remarks. Ver. 233. a sable Sorc'rer] Dr. Faustus, the subject of a sett of Farces, which lasted in vogue two or three seasons, in which both Playhouses strove to outdo each other for some years.

Immortal Rich!] Mr. John Rich, Master of the Theatre Royal in Covent-garden, was the first that excelled this way.Immortal Rich! how calm he sits at ease 'Mid snows of paper, and fierce hail of pease; And proud his Mistress' orders to perform, Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm. But lo! to dark encounter in mid air Remarks. Ver. 266. I see my Cibber there!] The history of the foregoing absurdities is verified by himself, in these words (Life, chap. xv.) “Then sprung forth that succession of monstrous medleys that have so long infested the stage, which arose upon one another alternately at both houses, out-vying each other in expence.” He then proceeds to excuse his own part in them, as follows: “If I am asked why I assented? I have no better excuse for my error than to confess I did it against my conscience, and had not virtue enough to starve. Had Henry IV. of France a better for changing his Religion? I was still in my heart, as much as he could be, on the side of Truth and Sense; but with this difference, that I had their leave to quit them when they could not support me.—But let the question go which way it will, Harry IVth has always been allowed a great man.” This must be confest a full answer, only the question still seems to be, 1. How the doing a thing against one's conscience is an excuse for it? and, 2dly, It will be hard to prove how he got the leave of Truth and Sense to quit their service, unless he can produce a Certificate that he ever was in it.

Tho' long my Party] Settle, like most Party-writers, was very uncertain in his political principles. He was employed to hold the pen in the Character of a popish successor, but afterwards printed his Narrative on the other side. He had managed the ceremony of a famous Pope-burning on Nov. 17, 1680. then became a trooper in King James's army, at Hounslowheath. After the Revolution he kept a booth at Bartholomew-fair, where, in the droll called St. George for England, he acted in his old age in a Dragon of green leather of his own invention; he was at last taken into the Charter-house, and there died, aged sixty years.Tho' long my Party built on me their hopes, For writing Pamphlets, and for roasting Popes; Yet lo! in me what authors have to brag on! Reduc'd at last to hiss in my own dragon. Avert it Heav'n! that thou, my Cibber, e'er Should'st wag a serpent-tail in Smithfield fair! Like the vile straw that's blown about the streets, The needy Poet sticks to all he meets, Coach'd, carted, trod upon, now loose, now fast, And carry'd off in some Dog's tail at last. Happier thy fortunes! like a rolling stone, Thy giddy dulness still shall lumber on, Safe in its heaviness, shall never stray, But lick up ev'ry blockhead in the way. Remarks. Ver. 297. Thee shall the Patriot, thee the Courtier taste,] It stood in the first edition with blanks, ? and ?. Concanen was sure “they must needs mean no body but King GEORGE and Queen CAROLINE; and said he would insist it was so, 'till the poet cleared himself by filling up the blanks otherwise, agreeably to the context, and consistent with his allegiance.” Pref. to a Collection of verses, essays, letters, &amp;c. against Mr. P. printed for A. Moor, p. 6.Thee shall the Patriot, thee the Courtier taste, And ev'ry year be duller than the last. 'Till rais'd from booths, to Theatre, to Court, Her seat imperial Dulness shall transport.

Polypheme] He translated the Italian Opera of Polifemo; but unfortunately lost the whole jest of the story. The Cyclops asks Ulysses his name, who tells him his name is Noman: After his eye is put out, he roars and calls the Brother Cyclops to his aid: They enquire who has hurt him? he answers Noman; whereupon they all go away again. Our ingenious Translator made Ulysses answer, I take no name, whereby all that follow'd became unintelligible. Hence it appears that Mr. Cibber (who values himself on subscribing to the English Translation of Homer's Iliad) had not that merit with respect to the Odyssey, or he might have been better instructed in the Greek Pun-nology.Teach thou the warb'ling Polypheme to roar, And scream thyself as none e'er scream'd before! To aid our cause, if Heav'n thou can'st not bend, Remarks. Ver. 308, 309. Faustus, Pluto, &amp;c.] Names of miserable Farces which it was the custom to act at the end of the best Tragedies, to spoil the digestion of the audience.Hell thou shalt move; for Faustus is our friend: Pluto with Cato thou for this shalt join, And link the Mourning Bride to Proserpine.

Ver. 312. ensure it but from Fire.] In the farce of Proserpine a corn-field was set on fire: whereupon the other playhouse had a barn burnt down for the recreation of the spectators. They also rival'd each other in showing the burnings of hell-fire, in Dr. Faustus.Thy stage shall stand, ensure it but from Fire. Remarks. Ver. 313. Another Æschylus appears!] It is reported of Æschylus, that when his tragedy of the Furies was acted, the audience were so terrified that the children fell into fits, and the big-bellied women miscarried.Another Æschylus appears! prepare For new abortions, all ye pregnant fair!

On Poets Tombs see Benson's titles writ;] W?m Benson (Surveyor of the Buildings to his Majesty King George I.) gave in a report to the Lords, that their House and the Painted-chamber adjoining were in immediate danger of falling. Whereupon the Lords met in a committee to appoint some other place to sit in, while the house should be taken down. But it being proposed to cause some other builders first to inspect it, they found it in very good condition. The Lords, upon this, were going upon an address to the King against Benson, for such a misrepresentation; but the Earl of Sunderland, then secretary, gave them an assurance that his Majesty would remove him, which was done accordingly. In favour of this man, the famous Sir Christopher Wren, who had been Architect to the crown for above fifty years, who built most of the Churches in London, laid the first stone of St. Paul's, and lived to finish it, had been displac'd from his employment at the age of near ninety years.On Poets Tombs see Benson's titles writ! Remarks. Ver. 326. Ambrose Philips] He was (saith Mr. Jacob) “one of the wits at Button's, and a justice of the peace;” But he hath since met with higher preferment in Ireland: and a much greater character we have of him in Mr. Gildon's Complete Art of Poetry, vol. 1. p. 157. “Indeed he confesses, he dares not set him quite on the same foot with Virgil, lest it should seem flattery; but he is much mistaken if posterity does not afford him a greater esteem than he at present enjoys.” He endeavour'd to create some misunderstanding between our author and Mr. Addison, whom also soon after he abused as much. His constant cry was, that Mr. P. was an Enemy to the government; and in particular he was the avowed author of a report very industriously spread, that he had a hand in a party-paper call'd the Examiner: A falshood well known to those yet living, who had the direction and publication of it.Lo! Ambrose Philips is prefer'd for Wit! See under Ripley rise a new White-hall, Remarks. Ver. 328. While Jones' and Boyle's united labours fall:] At the time when this poem was written, the banquetting-house of White-hall, the church and piazza of Covent-garden, and the palace and chapel of Somerset-house, the works of the famous Inigo Jones, had been for many years so neglected, as to be in danger of ruin. The portico of Covent-garden church had been just then restor'd and beautified at the expence of the Earl of Burlington; who, at the same time, by his publication of the designs of that great Master and Palladio, as well as by many noble buildings of his own, revived the true taste of Architecture in this Kingdom.While Jones' and Boyle's united labours fall: While Wren with sorrow to the grave descends, Remarks. Ver. 330. Gay dies unpension'd, &amp;c.] See Mr. Gay's fable of the Hare and many Friends. This gentleman was early in the friendship of our author, which continued to his death. He wrote several works of humour with great success, the Shepherd's Week, Trivia, the What-d'ye-call-it, Fables, and lastly, the celebrated Beggars Opera; a piece of satyr which hit all tastes and degrees of men, from those of the highest quality to the very rabble: That verse of Horace Primores populi arripuit, populumque tributim, could never be so justly applied as to this. The vast success of it was unprecedented, and almost incredible: What is related of the wonderful effects of the ancient music or tragedy hardly came up to it: Sophocles and Euripides were less follow'd and famous. It was acted in London sixty-three days, uninterrupted; and renew'd the next season with equal applauses. It spread into all the great towns of England, was play'd in many places to the thirtieth and fortieth time, at Bath and Bristol fifty, &amp;c. It made its progress into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where it was performed twenty four days together: It was lastly acted in Minorca. The fame of it was not confined to the author only; the ladies carried about with them the favourite songs of it in fans; and houses were furnished with it in screens. The person who acted Polly, till then obscure, became all at once the favourite of the town; her pictures were engraved, and sold in great numbers; her life written, books of letters and verses to her, published; and pamphlets made even of her sayings and jests. Furthermore, it drove out of England, for that season, the Italian Opera, which had carried all before it for ten years. That idol of the Nobility and the people, which the great Critic Mr. Dennis by the labours and outcries of a whole life could not overthrow, was demolished by a single stroke of this gentleman's pen. This happened in the Year 1728. Yet so great was his modesty, that he constantly prefixed to all the editions of it this motto, Nos hæc novimus esse nihil.Gay dies unpension'd with a hundred friends, Remarks. Ver. 331. Hibernian Politics, O Swift! thy fate;] See book 1. ver. 26.Hibernian Politics, O Swift! thy fate; Remarks. Ver. 332. And Pope's ten years to comment and translate.] The author here plainly laments that he was so long employed in translating and commenting. He began the Iliad in 1713, and finished it in 1719. The Edition of Shakespear (which he undertook merely because no body else would) took up near two years more in the drudgery of comparing impressions, rectifying the Scenary, &amp;c. and the Translation of half the Odyssey employed him from that time to 1725.And Pope's, ten years to comment and translate. Remarks. Ver. 321. Proceed, great days! &amp;c.] It may perhaps seem incredible, that so great a Revolution in Learning as is here prophesied, should be brought about by such weak Instruments as have been [hitherto] described in our poem: But do not thou, gentle reader, rest too secure in thy contempt of these Instruments. Remember what the Dutch stories somewhere relate, that a great part of their Provinces was once overflowed, by a small opening made in one of their dykes by a single Water-Rat. However, that such is not seriously the judgment of our Poet, but that he conceiveth better hopes from the Diligence of our Schools, from the Regularity of our Universities, the Discernment of our Great men, the Accomplishments of our Nobility, the Encouragement of our Patrons, and the Genius of our Writers in all kinds (notwithstanding some few exceptions in each) may plainly be seen from his conclusion; where causing all this vision to pass through the Ivory Gate, he expressly, in the language of Poesy, declares all such imaginations to be wild, ungrounded, and fictitious. Scribl.Proceed, great days! 'till Learning fly the shore, 'Till Birch shall blush with noble blood no more, 'Till Thames see Eaton's sons for ever play, 'Till Westminster's whole year be holiday, 'Till Isis' Elders reel, their pupils sport, And Alma mater lie dissolv'd in Port! Enough! enough! the raptur'd Monarch cries; Imitations. Ver. 340. And thro' the Iv'ry Gate, &amp;c.] Sunt geminæ Somni portæ; quarum altera fertur Cornea, qua veris facilis datur exitus umbris; Altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto, Sed falsa ad cœlum mittunt insomnia manes. Virg. Æn. vi.And thro' the Iv'ry Gate the Vision flies. The End of the Third Book. Book the Fourth. Remarks. The Dunciad, Book IV.] This Book may properly be distinguished from the former, by the Name of the Greater Dunciad, not so indeed in Size, but in Subject; and so far contrary to the distinction anciently made of the Greater and Lesser Iliad. But much are they mistaken who imagine this Work in any wise inferior to the former, or of any other hand than of our Poet; of which I am much more certain than that the Iliad itself was the Work of Solomon, or the Batrachomuomachia of Homer, as Barnes hath affirmed. Bent. ARGUMENT. The Poet being, in this Book, to declare the Completion of the Prophecies mention'd at the end of the former, makes a new Invocation; as the greater Poets are wont, when some high and worthy matter is to be sung. He shews the Goddess coming in her Majesty, to destroy Order and Science, and to substitute the Kingdom of the Dull upon earth. How she leads captive the Sciences, and silenceth the Muses; and what they be who succeed in their stead. All her Children, by a wonderful attraction, are drawn about her; and bear along with them divers others, who promote her Empire by connivance, weak resistance, or discouragement of Arts; such as Half-wits, tasteless Admirers, vain Pretenders, the Flatterers of Dunces, or the Patrons of them. All these crowd round her; one of them offering to approach her, is driven back by a Rival, but she commends and encourages both. The first who speak in form are the Genius's of the Schools, who assure her of their care to advance her Cause, by confining Youth to Words, and keeping them out of the way of real Knowledge. Their Address, and her gracious Answer; with her Charge to them and the Universities. The Universities appear by their proper Deputies, and assure her that the same method is observ'd in the progress of Education; The speech of Aristarchus on this subject. They are driven off by a band of young Gentlemen return'd from Travel with their Tutors; one of whom delivers to the Goddess, in a polite oration, an account of the whole Conduct and Fruits of their Travels: presenting to her at the same time a young Nobleman perfectly accomplished. She receives him graciously, and indues him with the happy quality of Want of Shame. She sees loitering about her a number of Indolent Persons abandoning all business and duty, and dying with laziness: To these approaches the Antiquary Annius, intreating her to make them Virtuosos, and assign them over to him: But Mummius, another Antiquary, complaining of his fraudulent proceeding, she finds a method to reconcile their difference. Then enter a Troop of people fantastically adorn'd, offering her strange and exotic presents: Amongst them, one stands forth and demands justice on another, who had deprived him of one of the greatest Curiosities in nature: but he justifies himself so well, that the Goddess gives them both her approbation. She recommends to them to find proper employment for the Indolents before-mentioned, in the study of Butterflies, Shells, Birds-nests, Moss, &amp;c. but with particular caution, not to proceed beyond Trifles, to any useful or extensive views of Nature, or of the Author of Nature. Against the last of these apprehensions, she is secured by a hearty Address from the Minute Philosophers and Freethinkers, one of whom speaks in the name of the rest. The Youth thus instructed and principled, are delivered to her in a body, by the hands of Silenus; and then admitted to taste the Cup of the Magus her High Priest, which causes a total oblivion of all Obligations, divine, civil, moral, or rational. To these her Adepts she sends Priests, Attendants, and Comforters, of various kinds; confers on them Orders and Degrees; and then dismissing them with a speech, confirming to each his Privileges and telling what she expects from each, concludes with a Yawn of extraordinary virtue: The Progress and Effects whereof on all Orders of men, and the Consummation of all, in the Restoration of Night and Chaos, conclude the Poem. Remarks. Ver. 1, &amp;c.] This is an Invocation of much Piety. The Poet willing to approve himself a genuine Son, beginneth by shewing (what is ever agreeable to Dulness) his high respect for Antiquity and a Great Family, how dull, or dark soever: Next declareth his love for Mystery and Obscurity; and lastly his Impatience to be re-united to her. Scribl. Yet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light Remarks. Ver. 2. dread Chaos, and eternal Night!] Invoked, as the Restoration of their Empire is the Action of the Poem.Indulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night! Of darkness visible so much be lent, Remarks. Ver. 4. half to shew, half veil the deep Intent.] This is a great propriety, for a dull Poet can never express himself otherwise than by halves, or imperfectly. Scribl. I understand it very differently; the Author in this work had indeed a deep Intent; there were in it Mysteries or ????????? which he durst not fully reveal, and doubtless in divers verses (according to Milton) ? more is meant than meets the ear. Bent.As half to shew, half veil the deep Intent. Ye Pow'rs! whose Mysteries restor'd I sing, Remarks. Ver. 6. To whom Time bears me on his rapid wing,] Fair and softly, good Poet! (cries the gentle Scriblerus on this place.) For sure in spite of his unusual modesty, he shall not travel so fast toward Oblivion, as divers others of more Confidence have done: For when I revolve in my mind the Catalogue of those who have the most boldly promised to themselves Immortality, viz. Pindar, Luis Gongora, Ronsard, Oldham, Lyrics; Lycophron, Statius, Chapman, Blackmore, Heroics; I find the one half to be already dead, and the other in utter darkness. But it becometh not us, who have taken upon us the office of Commentator, to suffer our Poet thus prodigally to cast away his Life; contrariwise, the more hidden and abstruse is his work, and the more remote its beauties from common Understanding, the more is it our duty to draw forth and exalt the same, in the face of Men and Angels. Herein shall we imitate the laudable Spirit of those, who have (for this very reason) delighted to comment on the Fragments of dark and uncouth Authors, preferred Ennius to Virgil, and chosen to turn the dark Lanthorn of Lycophron, rather than to trim the everlasting Lamp of Homer. Scribl.To whom Time bears me on his rapid wing, Remarks. Ver. 7. Force inertly strong,] Alluding to the Vis inertiæ of Matter, which, tho' it really be no Power, is yet the Foundation of all the Qualities and Attributes of that sluggish Substance.Suspend a while your Force inertly strong, Then take at once the Poet and the Song. Now flam'd the Dog-star's unpropitious ray, Smote ev'ry Brain, and wither'd ev'ry Bay; Remarks. Ver. 11, 12. Sick was the Sun,—The moon-struck Prophet] The Poet introduceth this, (as all great events are supposed by sage Historians to be preceded) by an Eclipse of the Sun; but with a peculiar propriety, as the Sun is the Emblem of that intellectual light which dies before the face of Dulness. Very apposite likewise is it to make this Eclipse, which is occasioned by the Moon's predominancy, the very time when Dulness and Madness are in Conjunction; whose relation and influence on each other the poet hath shewn in many places, Book I. ver. 22. Book 3. ver. 5, &amp; seq.Sick was the Sun, the Owl forsook his bow'r, The moon-struck Prophet felt the madding hour: Then rose the Seed of Chaos, and of Night, Remarks. Ver. 14. To blot out Order, and extinguish Light,] The two great Ends of her Mission; the one in quality of Daughter of Chaos, the other as Daughter of Night. Order here is to be understood extensively, both as Civil and Moral, the distinctions between high and low in Society, and true and false in Individuals: Light, as Intellectual only, Wit, Science, Arts.To blot out Order, and extinguish Light, Remarks. Ver. 15. Of dull and venal.] The Allegory continued; dull referring to the extinction of Light or Science, venal to the destruction of Order, or the Truth of Things. Ibid. a new World] In allusion to the Epicurean opinion, that from the Dissolution of the natural World into Night and Chaos, a new one should arise; this the Poet alluding to, in the Production of a new moral World, makes it partake of its original Principles.Of dull and venal a new World to mold, Remarks. Ver. 16. Lead and Gold,] i. e. dull and venal.And bring Saturnian days of Lead and Gold. She mounts the Throne: her head a Cloud conceal'd, Remarks. Ver. 18. all below reveal'd,] Vet. Adag. The higher you climb, the more you shew your A? Verified in no instance more than in Dulness aspiring. Emblematized also by an Ape climbing and exposing his posteriors. Scribl.In broad Effulgence all below reveal'd, ('Tis thus aspiring Dulness ever shines) Remarks. Ver. 20. her Laureat son reclines.] With great judgment it is imagined by the Poet, that such a Collegue as Dulness had elected, should sleep on the Throne, and have very little share in the Action of the Poem. Accordingly he hath done little or nothing from the day of his Anointing; having past through the second book without taking part in any thing that was transacted about him, and thro' the third in profound Sleep. Nor ought this, well considered, to seem strange in our days, when so many King-consorts have done the like. Scribl. This verse our excellent Laureate took so to heart, that he appealed to all mankind, “if he was not as seldom asleep as any fool?” But it is hoped the Poet hath not injured him, but rather verified his Prophecy (p. 243. of his own Life, 8vo. ch. ix.) where he says “the Reader will be as much pleased to find me a Dunce in my Old age, as he was to prove me a brisk blockhead in my Youth.” Wherever there was any room for Briskness, or Alacrity of any sort, even in sinking, he hath had it allowed him; but here, where there is nothing for him to do but to take his natural rest, he must permit his Historian to be silent. It is from their actions only that Princes have their character, and Poets from their works: And if in those he be as much asleep as any fool, the Poet must leave him and them to sleep to all eternity. Bent. Ibid. her Laureat] “When I find my Name in the satyrical works of this Poet, I never look upon it as any malice meant to me, but Profit to himself. For he considers that my Face is more known than most in the nation; and therefore a Lick at the Laureate will be a sure bait ad captandum vulgus, to catch little readers.” Life of Colley Cibber, chap. ii. Now if it be certain, that the works of our Poet have owed their success to this ingenious expedient, we hence derive an unanswerable Argument, that this Fourth Dunciad, as well as the former three, hath had the Author's last hand, and was by him intended for the Press: Or else to what purpose hath he crowned it, as we see, by this finishing stroke, the profitable Lick at the Laureate? Bent.Soft on her lap her Laureat son reclines. Remarks. Ver. 21, 22. Beneath her footstool, &amp;c.] We are next presented with the pictures of those whom the Goddess leads in Captivity. Science is only depressed and confined so as to be rendered useless; but Wit or Genius, as a more dangerous and active enemy, punished, or driven away: Dulness being often reconciled in some degree with Learning, but never upon any terms with Wit. And accordingly it will be seen that she admits something like each Science, as Casuistry, Sophistry, &amp;c.Beneath her foot-stool, Science groans in Chains, And Wit dreads Exile, Penalties and Pains. There foam'd rebellious Logic, gagg'd and bound, There, stript, fair Rhet'ric languish'd on the ground; His blunted Arms by Sophistry are born, And shameless Billingsgate her Robes adorn. Remarks. Ver. 27. by her false Guardians drawn,] Morality is the Daughter of Astræa. This alludes to the Mythology of the ancient Poets; who tell us that in the Gold and Silver ages, or in the State of Nature, the Gods cohabited with Men here on Earth; but when by reason of human degeneracy men were forced to have recourse to a Magistrate, and that the Ages of Brass and Iron came on, (that is, when Laws were wrote on brazen tablets and inforced by the Sword of Justice) the Celestials soon retired from Earth, and Astræa last of all; and then it was she left this her Orphan Daughter in the hands of the Guardians aforesaid. Scribl. Morality, by her false Guardians drawn, Chicane in Furs, and Casuistry in Lawn, Gasps, as they straiten at each end the cord, Remarks. Ver. 30. gives her Page the word.] There was a Judge of this name, always ready to hang any man, of which he was suffered to give a hundred miserable examples during a long life, even to his dotage.— Tho' the candid Scriblerus imagined Page here to mean no more than a Page or Mute, and to allude to the custom of strangling State Criminals in Turkey by Mutes or Pages. A practice more decent than that of our Page, who before he hanged any person, loaded him with reproachful language. Scribl.And dies, when Dulness gives her Page the word. Remarks. Ver. 31. Mad Mathesis] Alluding to the strange Conclusions some Mathematicians have deduced from their principles concerning the real Quantity of Matter, the Reality of Space, &amp;c.Mad Mathesis alone was unconfin'd, Too mad for mere material chains to bind, Remarks. Ver. 33. pure Space] i. e. pure and defæcated from Matter.—extatic Stare, the action of men who look about with full assurance of seeing what does not exist, such as those who expect to find Space a real being.Now to pure Space lifts her extatic stare, Remarks. Ver. 34. running round the Circle, finds it square.] Regards the wild and fruitless attempts of squaring the Circle.Now running round the Circle, finds it square. But held in ten-fold bonds the Muses lie, Remarks. Ver. 36. Watch'd both by Envy's and Flatt'ry's eye:] One of the misfortunes falling on Authors, from the Act for subjecting Plays to the power of a Licenser, being the false representations to which they were expos'd, from such as either gratify'd their Envy to Merit, or made their Court to Greatness, by perverting general Reflections against Vice into Libels on particular Persons.Watch'd both by Envy's and by Flatt'ry's eye: There to her heart sad Tragedy addrest The dagger wont to pierce the Tyrant's breast; Remarks. Ver. 39. But sober History] History attends on Tragedy, Satyr on Comedy, as their substitutes in the discharge of their distinct functions: the one in high life, recording the crimes and punishments of the great; the other in low, exposing the vices or follies of the common people. But it may be asked, How came History and Satyr to be admitted with impunity to minister comfort to the Muses, even in the presence of the Goddess, and in the midst of all her triumphs? A question, says Scriblerus, which we thus resolve: History was brought up in her infancy by Dulness herself; but being afterwards espoused into a noble house, she forgot (as is usual) the humility of her birth, and the cares of her early friends. This occasioned a long estrangement between her and Dulness. At length, in process of time, they met together in a Monk's Cell, were reconciled, and became better friends than ever. After this they had a second quarrel, but it held not long, and are now again on reasonable terms, and so are like to continue. This accounts for the connivance shewn to History on this occasion. But the boldness of Satyr springs from a very different cause; for the reader ought to know, that she alone of all the sisters is unconquerable, never to be silenced, when truly inspired and animated (as should seem) from above, for this very purpose, to oppose the kingdom of Dulness to her last breath.But sober History restrain'd her rage, And promis'd Vengeance on a barb'rous age. There sunk Thalia, nerveless, cold, and dead, Had not her Sister Satyr held her head: Remarks. Ver. 43. Nor cou'd'st thou, &amp;c.] This Noble Person in the year 1737, when the Act aforesaid was brought into the House of Lords, opposed it in an excellent speech (says Mr. Cibber) “with a lively spirit, and uncommon eloquence.” This speech had the honour to be answered by the said Mr. Cibber, with a a lively spirit also, and in a manner very uncommon, in the 8th Chapter of his Life and Manners. And here, gentle Reader, would I gladly insert the other speech, whereby thou mightest judge between them: but I must defer it on account of some differences not yet adjusted between the noble Author and myself, concerning the True Reading of certain passages. Scribl.Nor cou'd'st thou, Chesterfield! a tear refuse, Thou wept'st, and with thee wept each gentle Muse. Remarks. Ver. 45. When lo! a Harlot form] The Attitude given to this Phantom represents the nature and genius of the Italian Opera; its affected airs, its effeminate sounds, and the practice of patching up these Operas with favourite Songs, incoherently put together. These things were supported by the subscriptions of the Nobility. This circumstance that Opera should prepare for the opening of the grand Sessions, was prophesied of in Book 3. ver. 304. Already Opera prepares the way, The sure fore-runner of her gentle sway.When lo! a Harlot form soft sliding by, With mincing step, small voice, and languid eye; Foreign her air, her robe's discordant pride In patch-work flutt'ring, and her head aside: By singing Peers up-held on either hand, She tripp'd and laugh'd, too pretty much to stand; Cast on the prostrate Nine a scornful look, Then thus in quaint Recitativo spoke. O Cara! Cara! silence all that train: Remarks. Ver. 54. let Division reign:] Alluding to the false taste of playing tricks in Music with numberless divisions, to the neglect of that harmony which conforms to the Sense, and applies to the Passions. Mr. Handel had introduced a great number of Hands, and more variety of Instruments into the Orchestra, and employed even Drums and Cannon to make a fuller Chorus; which prov'd so much too manly for the fine Gentlemen of his age, that he was obliged to remove his Music into Ireland. After which they were reduced, for want of Composers, to practise the patch-work above mentioned.Joy to great Chaos! let Division reign: Remarks. Ver. 55. Chromatic tortures] That species of the ancient music called the Chromatic was a variation and embellishment, in odd irregularities, of the Diatonic kind. They say it was invented about the time of Alexander, and that the Spartans forbad the use of it, as languid and effeminate.Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them hence, Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense: One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage, Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage; Remarks. Ver. 59. Thy own Phœbus reigns,] Tuus jam regnat Apollo. Virg. Not the ancient Phœbus, the God of Harmony, but a modern Phœbus of French extraction, married to the Princess Galimathia, one of the handmaids of Dulness, and an assistant to Opera. Of whom see Bouhours, and other Critics of that nation. Scribl.To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore, And all thy yawning daughters cry, encore. Another Phœbus, thy own Phœbus, reigns, Joys in my jiggs, and dances in my chains. But soon, ah soon Rebellion will commence, If Music meanly borrows aid from Sense: Strong in new Arms, lo! Giant Handel stands, Like bold Briareus, with a hundred hands; To stir, to rouze, to shake the Soul he comes, And Jove's own Thunders follow Mars's Drums. Arrest him, Empress; or you sleep no more— She heard, and drove him to th'Hibernian shore. Remarks. Ver. 71. Fame's posterior Trumpet] Posterior, viz. her second or more certain Report: unless we imagine this word posterior to relate to the position of one of her Trumpets, according to Hudibras: She blows not both with the same Wind, But one before and one behind; And therefore modern Authors name One good, and t'other evil Fame.And now had Fame's posterior Trumpet blown, And all the Nations summon'd to the Throne. The young, the old, who feel her inward sway, One instinct seizes, and transports away. Remarks. Ver. 75. None need a guide,—None want a place,] The sons of Dulness want no instructors in study, nor guides in life: they are their own masters in all Sciences, and their own Heralds and Introducers into all places.None need a guide, by sure Attraction led, Remarks. Ver. 76 to 101.] It ought to be observed that here are three classes in this assembly. The first of men absolutely and avowedly dull, who naturally adhere to the Goddess, and are imaged in the simile of the Bees about their Queen. The second involuntarily drawn to her, tho' not caring to own her influence; from ver. 81 to 90. The third of such, as, tho' not members of her state, yet advance her service by flattering Dulness, cultivating mistaken talents, patronizing vile scriblers, discouraging living merit, or setting up for wits, and Men of taste in arts they understand not; from ver 91 to 101. In this new world of Dulness each of these three classes hath its appointed station, as best suits its nature, and concurs to the harmony of the System. The first drawn only by the strong and simple impulse of Attraction, are represented as falling directly down into her; as conglobed into her substance, and resting in her centre. ? All their centre found, Hung to the Goddess, and coher'd around. The second, tho' within the sphere of her attraction, yet having at the same time a different motion, they are carried, by the composition of these two, in planetary revolutions round her centre, some nearer to it, some further off: Who gently drawn, and struggling less and less, Roll in her Vortex, and her pow'r confess. The third are properly excentrical, and no constant members of her state or system: sometimes at an immense distance from her influence, and sometimes again almost on the surface of her broad effulgence. Their use in their Perihelion, or nearest approach to Dulness, is the same in the moral World, as that of Comets in the natural, namely to refresh and recreate the Dryness and decays of the system; in the manner marked out from ver. 91 to 98.And strong impulsive gravity of Head: None want a place, for all their Centre found, Hung to the Goddess, and coher'd around. Not closer, orb in orb, conglob'd are seen The buzzing Bees about their dusky Queen. The gath'ring number, as it moves along, Involves a vast involuntary throng, Who gently drawn, and struggling less and less, Roll in her Vortex, and her pow'r confess. Not those alone who passive own her laws, But who, weak rebels, more advance her cause. Whate'er of dunce in College or in Town Sneers at another, in toupee or gown; Whate'er of mungril no one class admits, A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits. Nor absent they, no members of her state, Who pay her homage in her sons, the Great; Remarks. Ver. 93. false to Phœbus,] Spoken of the ancient and true Phœbus, not the French Phœbus, who hath no chosen Priests or Poets, but equally inspires any man that pleaseth to sing or preach. Scribl.Who false to Phœbus, bow the knee to Baal; Or impious, preach his Word without a call. Patrons, who sneak from living worth to dead, With-hold the pension, and set up the head; Or vest dull Flatt'ry in the sacred Gown; Or give from fool to fool the Laurel crown. Remarks. Ver. 99, 100. And (last and worst) with all the cant of wit, Without the soul, the Muse's Hypocit. ] In this division are reckoned up 1. The Idolizers of Dulness in the Great—2. Ill Judges,—3. Ill Writers,—4. Ill Patrons. But the last and worst, as he justly calls him, is the Muse's Hypocrite, who is as it were the Epitome of them all. He who thinks the only end of poetry is to amuse, and the only business of the poet to be witty; and consequently who cultivates only such trifling talents in himself, and encourages only such in others.And (last and worst) with all the cant of wit, Without the soul, the Muse's Hypocrit. There march'd the bard and blockhead, side by side, Who rhym'd for hire, and patroniz'd for pride. Narcissus, prais'd with all a Parson's pow'r, Look'd a white lilly sunk beneath a show'r. There mov'd Montalto with superior air; His stretch'd-out arm display'd a Volume fair; Courtiers and Patriots in two ranks divide, Thro' both he pass'd, and bow'd from side to side: But as in graceful act, with awful eye Remarks. Ver. 110. bold Benson] This man endeavoured to raise himself to Fame by erecting monuments, striking coins, setting up heads, and procuring translations, of Milton; and afterwards by a great passion for Arthur Johnston, a Scotch physician's Version of the Psalms, of which he printed many fine Editions. See more of him, Book 3. ver. 325.Compos'd he stood, bold Benson thrust him by: On two unequal crutches propt he came, Milton's on this, on that one Johnston's name. The decent Knight retir'd with sober rage, Remarks. Ver. 114, &amp;c. Sh?r's page?] An Edition of that Author, with his Text arbitrarily altered throughout, was at this time printing at the University Press by the encouragement of the Vice-Chancellor, and certain Heads of Houses, who subscribed for three hundred, to be taken off by the Gentlemen Commoners.“What! no respect, he cry'd, for Shakespear's page But (happy for him as the times went then) Appear'd Apollo's May'r and Aldermen, On whom three hundred gold-capt youths await, To lug the pond'rous volume off in state. Remarks. Ver. 119. “Thus revive, &amp;c.] The Goddess applauds the practice of tacking the obscure names of Persons not eminent in any branch of learning, to those of the most distinguished Writers; either by printing Editions of their works with impertinent alterations of their Text, as in the former instances, or by setting up Monuments disgraced with their own vile names and inscriptions as in the latter.When Dulness, smiling—“Thus revive the Wits!

Ibid. A Page,] Pagina, not Pedissequus. A Page of a Book, not a Servant, Follower, or Attendant; no Poet having had a Page since the death of Mr. Thomas Durfey. Scribl.A Page, a Grave, that they can call their own; But spread, my sons, your glory thin or thick, On passive paper, or on solid brick. Remarks. Ver. 131. So by each Bard an Alderman, &amp;c.] Vide the Tombs of the Poets, Editio Westmonasteriensis.So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit, A heavy Lord shall hang at ev'ry Wit, And while on Fame's triumphal Car they ride, Some Slave of mine be pinion'd to their side. Now crowds on crowds around the Goddess press, Each eager to present the first Address. Remarks. Ver. 137, 138. Dunce Scorning dunce beholds the next advance, But Fop shews Fop superior complaisance. ] This is not to be ascribed so much to the different manners of a Court and College, as to the different effects which a pretence to Learning, and a pretence to Wit, have on Blockheads. For as Judgment consists in finding out the differences in things, and Wit in finding out their likenesses, so the Dunce is all discord and dissension, and constantly busied in reproving, examining, confuting, &amp;c. while the Fop flourishes in peace, with Songs and Hymns of Praise, Addresses, Characters, Epithalamiums, &amp;c.Dunce scorning Dunce beholds the next advance, But Fop shews Fop superior complaisance.

Ver. 174. that Master-piece of Man.] viz. an Epigram. The famous Dr. South declared a perfect Epigram to be as difficult a performance as an Epic Poem. And the Critics say, “an Epic Poem is the greatest work human nature is capable of.”And South beheld that Master-piece of Man. Remarks. Ver. 175. Oh (cry'd the Goddess) &amp;c.] The matter under debate is how to confine men to Words for life. The instructors of youth shew how well they do their parts; but complain that when men come into the world they are apt to forget their Learning, and turn themselves to useful Knowledge. This was an evil that wanted to be redressed. And this the Goddess assures them will need a more extensive Tyranny than that of Grammar schools. She therefore points out to them the remedy, in her wishes for arbitrary Power; whose interest it being to keep menfrom the study of things, will encourage the propagation of words and sounds; and to make all sure, she wishes for another Pedant Monarch. The sooner to obtain so great a blessing, she is willing even for once to violate the fundamental principle of her politics, in having her sons taught at least one thing; but that sufficient, the Doctrine of Divine Right. Nothing can be juster than the observation here insinuated, that no branch of Learning thrives well under Arbitrary government but Verbal. The reasons are evident. It is unsafe under such Governments to cultivate the study of things of importance. Besides, when men have lost their public virtue, they naturally delight in trifles, if their private morals secure them from being vicious. Hence so great a Cloud of Scholiasts and Grammarians so soon overspread the Learning of Greece and Rome, when once those famous Communities had lost their Liberties. Another reason is the encouragement which arbitrary governments give to the study of words, in order to busy and amuse active genius's, who might otherwise prove troublesome and inquisitive. So when Cardinal Richelieu had destroyed the poor remains of his Country's liberties, and made the supreme Court of Parliament merely ministerial, he instituted the French Academy. What was said upon that occasion, by a brave Magistrate, when the letters-patent of its erection came to be verified in the Parliament of Paris, deserves to be remembered: He told the assembly, that this adventure put him in mind after what manner an Emperor of Rome once treated his Senate; who when he had deprived them of the cognizance of Public matters, sent a message to them in form for their opinion about the best Sauce for a Turbot.Oh (cry'd the Goddess) for some pedant Reign! Remarks. Ver. 176. Some gentle James &amp;c.] Wilson tells us that this King, James the first, took upon himself to teach the Latin tongue to Car, Earl of Somerset; and that Gondomar the Spanish Ambassador wou'd speak false Latin to him, on purpose to give him the pleasure of correcting it, whereby he wrought himself into his good graces. This great Prince was the first who assumed the title of Sacred Majesty, which his loyal Clergy transfer'd from God to Him. “The principles of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance (says the Author of the Dissertation on Parties, Letter 8.) which before his time had skulk'd perhaps in some old Homily, were talk'd, written, and preach'd into vogue in that inglorious reign.Some gentle James, to bless the land again; To stick the Doctor's Chair into the Throne, Give law to Words, or war with Words alone, Senates and Courts with Greek and Latin rule, And turn the Council to a Grammar School! Remarks. Ver. 181, 182. if Dulness sees a grateful Day, 'Tis in the shade of Arbitrary Sway.] And grateful it is in Dulness to make this confession. I will not say she alludes to that celebrated verse of Claudian, ? nunquam Libertas gratior extat Quam sub Rege pio ? But this I will say, that the words Liberty and Monarchy have been frequently confounded and mistaken one for the other by the gravest authors. I should therefore conjecture, that the genuine reading of the forecited verse was thus, ? nunquam Libertas gratior exstat Quam sub Lege pia ? and that Rege was the reading only of Dulness herself: And therefore she might allude to it. Scribl. I judge quite otherwise of this passage: The genuine reading is Libertas, and Rege: So Claudian gave it. But the error lies in the first verse: It should be Exit, not Exstat, and then the meaning will be, that Liberty was never lost, or went away with so good a grace, as under a good King: it being without doubt a tenfold shame to lose it under a bad one. This farther leads me to animadvert upon a most grievous piece of nonsense to be found in all the Editions of the Author of the Dunciad himself. A most capital one it is, and owing to the confusion above mentioned by Scriblerus, of the two words Liberty and Monarchy. Essay on Crit. Nature, like Monarchy, is but restrain'd By the same Laws herself at first ordain'd. Who sees not, it should be, Nature like Liberty? Correct it therefore repugnantibus omnibus (even tho' the Author himself should oppugn) in all the impressions which have been, or shall be, made of his works. Bentl.For sure, if Dulness sees a grateful Day, 'Tis in the shade of Arbitrary Sway. O! if my sons may learn one earthly thing, Teach but that one, sufficient for a King; That which my Priests, and mine alone, maintain, Which as it dies, or lives, we fall, or reign: May you, may Cam, and Isis preach it long! “The Right Divine of Kings to govern wrong.” Prompt at the call, around the Goddess roll Broad hats, and hoods, and caps, a sable shoal: Thick and more thick the black blockade extends, Remarks. Ver. 192. A hundred head of Aristotle's friends.] The Philosophy of Aristotle had suffered a long disgrace in this learned University: being first expelled by the Cartesian, which, in its turn, gave place to the Newtonian. But it had all this while some faithful followers in secret, who never bowed the knee to Baal, nor acknowledged any strange God in Philosophy. These, on this new appearance of the Goddess, come out like Confessors, and make an open profession of the ancient faith in the ipse dixit of their Master. Thus far Scriblerus. But the learned Mr. Colley Cibber takes the matter quite otherwise; and that this various fortune of Aristotle relates not to his natural, but his moral Philosophy. For speaking of that University in his time, he says, they seemed to have as implicit a Reverence for Shakespear and Johnson, as formerly for the Ethics of Aristotle. See his Life, p. 385. One would think this learned professor had mistaken Ethics for Physics; unless he might imagine the Morals too were grown into disuse, from the relaxation they admitted of during the time he mentions, viz. while He and the Players were at Oxford. Ibid. A hundred head, &amp;c.] It appears by this the Goddess has been careful of keeping up a Succession, according to the rule, Semper enim refice: ac ne post amissa requiras, Anteveni; &amp; sobolem armento sortire quotannis. It is remarkable with what dignity the Poet here describes the friends of this ancient Philosopher. Horace does not observe the same decorum with regard to those of another sect, when he says Cum ridere voles Epicuri de grege Porcum. But the word Drove, Armentum, here understood, is a word of honour, as the most noble Festus the Grammarian assures us, Armentum id genus pecoris appellatur, quod est idoneum opus armorum. And alluding to the temper of this warlike breed, our poet very appositely calls them a hundred head. Scribl.A hundred head of Aristotle's friends. Nor wert thou, Isis! wanting to the day, Remarks. Ver. 194. [Tho' Christ-church] This line is doubtless spurious, and foisted in by the impertinence of the Editor; and accordingly we have put it between Hooks. For I affirm this College came as early as any other, by its proper Deputies; nor did any College pay homage to Dulness in its whole body. Bentl.[Tho' Christ-church long kept prudishly away.] Each staunch Polemic, stubborn as a rock, Remarks. Ver. 196. still expelling Locke] In the year 1703 there was a meeting of the heads of the University of Oxford to censure Mr. Locke's Essay on Human Understanding, and to forbid the reading it. See his Letters in the last Edit.Each fierce Logician, still expelling Locke, Came whip and spur, and dash'd thro' thin and thick Remarks. Ver. 198. On German Crouzaz and Dutch Burgersdyck.] There seems to be an improbability that the Doctors and Heads of Houses should ride on horseback, who of late days, being gouty or unweildy, have kept their coaches. But these are horses of great strength, and fit to carry any weight, as their German and Dutch extraction may manifest; and very famous we may conclude, being honour'd with Names, as were the horses Pegasus and Bucephalus. Scribl.On German Crouzaz, and Dutch Burgersdyck. Remarks. Ver. 199. the streams] The River Cam, running by the walls of these Colleges, which are particularly famous for their skill in Disputation.As many quit the streams that murm'ring fall To lull the sons of Marg'ret and Clare-hall, Where Bentley late tempestuous wont to sport Remarks. Ver. 202. sleeps in Port.] viz. “now retired into harbour, after the tempests that had long agitated his society.” So Scriblerus. But the learned Scipio Maffei understands it of a certain Wine called Port, from Oporto a city of Portugal, of which this Professor invited him to drink abundantly. Scip. Maff. de Compotationibus Academicis.In troubled waters, but now sleeps in Port. Before them march'd that awful Aristarch; Plow'd was his front with many a deep Remark: Remarks. Ver. 205. His Hat, &amp;c.—So upright Quakers please both Man and God.] The Hat-worship, as the Quakers call it, is an abomination to that sect: yet, where it is necessary to pay that respect to man (as in the Courts of Justice and Houses of Parliament) they have, to avoid offence, and yet not violate their conscience, permitted other people to uncover them.His Hat, which never vail'd to human pride, Walker with rev'rence took, and lay'd aside. Imitations. Ver. 207. —He, kingly, did but nod;] Milton, ? He, kingly, from his State Declin'd not ?Low bow'd the rest: He, kingly, did but nod; So upright Quakers please both Man and God. Mistress! dismiss that rabble from your throne: Remarks. Ver. 210. Aristarchus] A famous Commentator, and Corrector of Homer, whose name has been frequently used to signify a complete Critic. The Compliment paid by our author to this eminent Professor, in applying to him so great a Name, was the reason that he hath omitted to comment on this part which contains his own praises. We shall therefore supply that loss to our best ability. Scribl. Imitations. Ver. 210. —is Aristarchus yet unknown?] ? Sic notus Ulysses? Virg. Dost thou not feel me, Rome? Ben. Johnson.Avaunt—is Aristarchus yet unknown? Thy mighty Scholiast, whose unweary'd pains Made Horace dull, and humbled Milton's strains. Turn what they will to Verse, their toil is vain, Critics like me shall make it Prose again. Imitations. Ver. 215. Roman and Greek Grammarians, &amp;c.] Imitated from Propertius speaking of the Æneid. Cedite, Romani scriptores, cedite Graii! Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade.Roman and Greek Grammarians! know your Better: Author of something yet more great than Letter; Remarks. Ver. 217, 218. While tow'ring o'er your Alphabet, like Saul,—Stands our Digamma,] Alludes to the boasted restoration of the Æolic Digamma, in his long projected Edition of Homer. He calls it something more than Letter, from the enormous figure it would make among the other letters, being one Gamma set upon the shoulders of another.While tow'ring o'er your Alphabet, like Saul, Stands our Digamma, and o'er-tops them all. 'Tis true, on Words is still our whole debate, Remarks. Ver. 220. of Me or Te,] It was a serious dispute, about which the learned were much divided, and some treatises written: Had it been about Meum or Tuum it could not be more contested, than whether at the end of the first Ode of Horace, to read, Me doctarum hederæ præmia frontium, or, Te doctarum hederæ ?Disputes of Me or Te, of aut or at, To sound or sink in cano, O or A, Remarks. Ver. 122. Or give up Cicero to C or K.] Grammatical disputes about the manner of pronouncing Cicero's name in Greek. It is a dispute whether in Latin the name of Hermagoras should end in as or a. Quintilian quotes Cicero as writing it Hermagora, which Bentley rejects, and says Quintilian must be mistaken, Cicero could not write it so, and that in this case he would not believe Cicero himself. These are his very words: Ego vero Ciceronem ita scripsisse ne Ciceroni quidem affirmanti crediderim. —Epist. ad Mill. in fin. Frag. Menand. et Phil.Or give up Cicero to C or K. Remarks. Ver. 223, 224. Freind,—Alsop] Dr. Robert Freind, master of Westminster-school, and canon of Christ-church—Dr. Anthony Alsop, a happy imitator of the Horatian style.Let Freind affect to speak as Terence spoke, And Alsop never but like Horace joke: For me, what Virgil, Pliny may deny, Remarks. Ver. 226. Manilius or Solinus] Some Critics having had it in their choice to comment either on Virgil or Manilius, Pliny or Solinus, have chosen the worse author, the more freely to display their critical capacity.Manilius or Solinus shall supply: For Attic Phrase in Plato let them seek, Remarks. Ver. 228, &amp;c. Suidas, Gellius, Stobæus] The first a Dictionary-writer, a collector of impertinent facts and barbarous words; the second a minute Critic; the third an author, who gave his Common-place book to the public, where we happen to find much Mince-meat of old books.I poach in Suidas for unlicens'd Greek. In ancient Sense if any needs will deal, Be sure I give them Fragments, not a Meal; What Gellius or Stobæus hash'd before, Remarks. Ver. 232. Or chew'd by blind old Scholiasts o'er and o'er.] These taking the same things eternally from the mouth of one another.Or chew'd by blind old Scholiasts o'er and o'er. The critic Eye, that microscope of Wit, Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit: How parts relate to parts, or they to whole, The body's harmony, the beaming soul, Are things which Kuster, Burman, Wasse shall see, When Man's whole frame is obvious to a Flea. Remarks. Ver. 239, 240. Ah, think not, Mistress, &amp;c.] By this it would seem the Dunces and Fops mentioned ver. 139, 140. had a contention of rivalship for the Goddess's favour on this great day. Those got the start, but these make it up by their Spokesmen in the next speech. It seem as if Aristarchus here first saw him advancing with his fair Pupil. Scribl.Ah, think not, Mistress! more true Dulness lies In Folly's Cap, than Wisdom's grave disguise. Remarks. Ver. 241, 242. Like buoys, &amp;c.—On Learning's surface, &amp;c.] So that the station of a Professor is only a kind of legal Noticer to inform us where the shatter'd hulk of Learning lies at anchor; which after so long unhappy navigation, and now without either Master or Patron, we may wish, with Horace, may lie there still. ? Nonne vides, ut Nudum remigio latus? ? non tibi sunt integra lintea; Non Dî, quos iterum pressa voces malo. Quamvis pontica pinus, Sylvæ filia nobilis, Jactes &amp; genus, &amp; nomen inutile. Hor. Scribl.Like buoys, that never sink into the flood, On Learning's surface we but lie and nod. Thine is the genuine head of many a house, Remarks. Ver. 244. And much Divinity without a ????.] A word much affected by the learned Aristarchus in common conversation, to signify Genius or natural acumen. But this passage has a farther view: ???? was the Platonic term for Mind, or the first Cause, and that system of Divinity is here hinted at which terminates in blind Nature without a ????: such as the Poet afterwards describes (speaking of the dreams of one of these later Platonists) Or that bright Image to our Fancy draw, Which Theocles in raptur'd Vision saw, That Nature ? &amp;c.And much Divinity without a ????. Remarks. Ver. 245, 246. Barrow, Atterbury,] Isaac Barrow Master of Trinity, Francis Atterbury Dean of Christ-church, both great Genius's and eloquent Preachers; one more conversant in the sublime Geometry, the other in classical Learning; but who equally made it their care to advance the polite Arts in their several Societies.Nor could a Barrow work on ev'ry block, Nor has one Atterbury spoil'd the flock. Remarks. Ver. 247. the heavy Canon] Canon here, if spoken of Artillery, is in the plural number; if of the Canons of the House, in the singular, and meant only of one: in which case I suspect the Pole to be a false reading, and that it should be the Poll, or Head of that Canon. It may be objected, that this is a mere Paranomasia or Pun. But what of that? Is any figure of Speech more apposite to our gentle Goddess, or more frequently used by her, and her Children, especially of the University? Doubtless it better suits the Character of Dulness, yea of a Doctor, than that of an Angel; yet Milton fear'd not to put a considerable quantity into the mouths of his. It hath indeed been observed, that they were the Devil's Angels, as if he did it to suggest the Devil was the Author as well of false Wit, as of false Religion, and that the Father of Lies was also the Father of Puns. But this is idle: It must be own'd a Christian practice, used in the primitive times by some of the Fathers, and in later by most of the Sons of the Church; till the debauch'd reign of Charles the second, when the shameful Passion for Wit overthrew every thing: and even then the best Writers admitted it, provided it was obscene, under the name of the Double entendre. Scribl.See! still thy own, the heavy Canon roll, Remarks. Ver. 248. And Metaphysic smokes, &amp;c.] Here the learned Aristarchus ending the first member of his harangue in behalf of Words; and entering on the other half, which regards the teaching of Things; very artfully connects the two parts in an encomium on Metaphysics, a kind of Middle nature between words and things: communicating, in its obscurity with Substance, and in its emptiness with Names. Scribl.And Metaphysic smokes involve the Pole. For thee we dim the eyes, and stuff the head With all such reading as was never read: For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it, And write about it, Goddess, and about it: So spins the silk-worm small its slender store, And labours till it clouds itself all o'er. Remarks. Ver. 255 to 271. What tho' we let some better sort of fool, &amp;c.] Hitherto Aristarchus hath displayed the art of teaching his Pupils words, without things. He shews greater skill in what follows, which is to teach things, without profit. For with the better sort of fool the first expedient is, ver. 254 to 258, to run him so swiftly through the circle of the Sciences that he shall stick at nothing, nor nothing stick with him; and though some little, both of words and things, should by chance be gathered up in his passage, yet he shews, ver. 255 to 260, that it is never more of the one than just to enable him to persecute with Rhyme, or of the other than to plague with Dispute. But, if after all, the Pupil will needs learn a Science, it is then provided by his careful directors, ver. 261, 262, that it shall either be such as he can never enjoy when he comes out into life, or such as he will be obliged to divorce. And to make all sure, ver. 263 to 268, the useless or pernicious Sciences, thus taught, are still applied perversely; the man of Wit petrified in Euclid, or trammelled in Metaphysics; and the man of Judgment married, without his parents consent, to a Muse. Thus far the particular arts of modern Education, used partially, and diversified according to the Subject and the Occasion: But there is one general Method, with the encomium of which the great Aristarchus ends his speech, ver. 266 to 268, and that is Authority, the universal Cement, which fills all the cracks and chasms of lifeless matter, shuts up all the pores of living substance, and brings all human minds to one dead level. For if Nature should chance to struggle through all the entanglements of the foregoing ingenious expedients to bind rebel wit, this claps upon her one sure and entire cover. So that well may Aristarchus defy all human power to get the Man out again from under so impenetrable a crust. The Poet alludes to this Master-piece of the Schools in ver. 501, where he speaks of Vassals to a name.What tho' we let some better sort of fool Thrid ev'ry science, run thro' ev'ry school? Never by tumbler thro' the hoops was shown Such skill in passing all, and touching none. He may indeed (if sober all this time) Plague with Dispute, or persecute with Rhyme. We only furnish what he cannot use, Or wed to what he must divorce, a Muse: Full in the midst of Euclid dip at once, Remarks. Ver. 264. petrify a Genius] Those who have no Genius, employ'd in works of imagination; those who have, in abstract sciences.And petrify a Genius to a Dunce: Or set on Metaphysic ground to prance, Show all his paces, not a step advance. With the same Cement, ever sure to bind, We bring to one dead level ev'ry mind. Then take him to devellop, if you can, Remarks. Ver. 270. And hew the Block off,] A notion of Aristotle, that there was originally in every block of marble, a Statue, which would appear on the removal of the superfluous parts.And hew the Block off, and get out the Man. But wherefore waste I words? I see advance Remarks. Ver. 272. lac'd Governor] Why lac'd? Because Gold and Silver are necessary trimming to denote the dress of a person of rank, and the Governor must be supposed so in foreign countries, to be admitted into Courts and other places of fair reception. But how comes Aristarchus to know by sight that this Governor came from France? Why, by the laced coat. Scribl. Ibid. Whore, Pupil, and lac'd Governor] Some Critics have objected to the order here, being of opinion that the Governor should have the precedence before the Whore, if not before the Pupil. But were he so placed, it might be thought to insinuate that the Governor led the Pupil to the Whore: and were the Pupil placed first, he might be supposed to lead the Governor to her. But our impartial Poet, as he is drawing their Picture, represents them in the order in which they are generally seen; namely, the Pupil between the Whore and the Governor; but placeth the Whore first, as she usually governs both the other.Whore, Pupil, and lac'd Governor from France. Walker! our hat—nor more he deign'd to say, Remarks. Ver. 274. stern as Ajax' spectre,] See Homer Odyss. xi. where the Ghost of Ajax turns sullenly from Ulysses. A Passage extremely admired by Longinus.But, stern as Ajax' spectre, strode away. In flow'd at once a gay embroider'd race, Remarks. Ver. 276. And titt'ring push'd, &amp;c..] Hor. Rideat &amp; pulset lasciva decentiùs ætas.And titt'ring push'd the Pedants off the place: Some would have spoken, but the voice was drown'd By the French horn, or by the op'ning hound. Remarks. Ver. 279. The first came forward, &amp;c.] This Forwardness or Pertness is the certain consequence, when the Children of Dulness are spoiled by too great fondness of their Parent.The first came forwards, with as easy mien, Remarks. Ver. 280. As if he saw St. James's,] Reflecting on the disrespectful and indecent Behaviour of several forward young Persons in the Presence, so offensive to all serious men, and to none more than the good Scriblerus.As if he saw St. James's and the Queen. Remarks. Ver. 281. th'attendant Orator] The Governor abovesaid. The Poet gives him no particular name; being unwilling, I presume, to offend or do injustice to any, by celebrating one only with whom this character agrees, in preference to so many who equally deserve it. Scribl.When thus th'attendant Orator begun. Receive, great Empress! thy accomplish'd Son: Thine from the birth, and sacred from the rod, Remarks. Ver. 284. A dauntless Infant! never scar'd with God.] Hor. ? sine Dis Animosus Infans.A dauntless infant! never scar'd with God. The Sire saw, one by one, his Virtues wake: The Mother begg'd the blessing of a Rake. Thou gav'st that Ripeness, which so soon began, Remarks. Ver. 288. he ne'er was Boy, nor Man.] Nature hath bestowed on the human species two states or conditions, Infancy and Manhood. Wit sometimes makes the first disappear, and Folly the latter; but true Dulness annihilates both. For, want of apprehension in Boys, not suffering that conscious ignorance and inexperience which produce the awkward bashfulness of youth, makes them assured; and want of imagination makes them grave. But this gravity and assurance, which is beyond boyhood, being neither wisdom nor knowledge, do never reach to manhood. Scribl.And ceas'd so soon, he ne'er was Boy, nor Man. Thro' School and College, thy kind cloud o'ercast, Remarks. Ver. 290. unseen the young Æneas past: Thence bursting glorious,] See Virg. Æn. 1. At Venus obscuro gradientes aëre sepsit, Et multo nebulæ circum Dea fudit amictu, Cernere ne quis eos;—1. neu quis contingere possit; 2. Molirive moram;—aut 3. veniendi poscere causas. Where he enumerates the causes why his mother took this care of him: to wit, 1. that no-body might touch or correct him: 2. might stop or detain him: 3. examine him about the progress he had made, or so much as guess why he came there.Safe and unseen the young Æneas past: Thence bursting glorious, all at once let down, Stunn'd with his giddy Larum half the town. Intrepid then, o'er seas and lands he flew: Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too. There all thy gifts and graces we display, Thou, only thou, directing all our way! To where the Seine, obsequious as she runs, Pours at great Bourbon's feet her silken sons; Or Tyber, now no longer Roman, rolls, Vain of Italian Arts, Italian Souls: To happy Convents, bosom'd deep in vines, Where slumber Abbots, purple as their wines: Remarks. Ver. 303. lilly-silver'd vales,] Tuberoses.To Isles of fragrance, lilly-silver'd vales, Diffusing languor in the panting gales: To lands of singing, or of dancing slaves, Love-whisp'ring woods, and lute-resounding waves. But chief her shrine where naked Venus keeps, Remarks. Ver. 308. And Cupids ride the Lyon of the Deeps;] The winged Lyon, the Arms of Venice. This Republic heretofore the most considerable in Europe, for her Naval Force and the extent of her Commerce; now illustrious for her Carnivals.And Cupids ride the Lyon of the Deeps; Where, eas'd of Fleets, the Adriatic main Wafts the smooth Eunuch and enamour'd swain. Led by my hand, he saunter'd Europe round, And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground; Saw ev'ry Court, hear'd ev'ry King declare His royal Sense, of Op'ra's or the Fair; The Stews and Palace equally explor'd, Intrigu'd with glory, and with spirit whor'd; Try'd all hors-d'œuvres, all liqueurs defin'd, Remarks. Ver. 318. greatly-daring din'd;] It being indeed no small risque to eat thro' those extraordinary compositions, whose disguis'd ingredients are generally unknown to the guests, and highly inflammatory and unwholsome.Judicious drank, and greatly-daring din'd; Dropt the dull lumber of the Latin store, Spoil'd his own language, and acquir'd no more; All Classic learning lost on Classic ground; Remarks. Ver. 322. And last turn'd Air, the Echo of a Sound!] Yet less a Body than Echo itself; for Echo reflects Sense or Words at least, this Gentleman only Airs and Tunes: ? Sonus est, qui vivit in illo. Ovid. Met. So that this was not a Metamorphosis either in one or the other, but only a Resolution of the Soul into its true Principles, its real Essence being Harmony; according to the Doctrine of Orpheus, the Inventor of Opera, who first perform'd to a choice assembly of Beasts. Scribl.And last turn'd Air, the Echo of a Sound! See now, half-cur'd, and perfectly well-bred, Remarks. Ver. 324. With nothing but a Solo in his head;] With nothing but a Solo? Why, if it be a Solo, how should there be any thing else? Palpable Tautology! Read boldly an Opera, which is enough of conscience for such a head as has lost all its Latin. Bentl.With nothing but a Solo in his head; As much Estate, and Principle, and Wit, Remarks. Ver. 326. Jansen, Fleetwood, Cibber,] Three very eminent persons, all Managers of Plays; who, tho' not Governors by profession, had, each in his way, concern'd themselves in the Education of Youth; and regulated their Wits, their Morals, or their Finances, at that period of their age which is the most important, their entrance into the polite world. Of the last of these, and his Talents for this end, see Book I. ver. 199, &amp;c.As Jansen, Fleetwood, Cibber shall think fit; Stol'n from a Duel, follow'd by a Nun, And, if a Borough chuse him, not undone; See, to my country happy I restore This glorious Youth, and add one Venus more. Remarks. Ver. 331. Her too receive, &amp;c.] This confirms what the learned Scriblerus advanced in his Note on ver. 272, that the Governor, as well as the Pupil, had a particular interest in this lady.Her too receive (for her my soul adores) Remarks. Ver. 332. So may the sons of sons, &amp;c.] Virg. Et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis. Æn. iii. Ibid. sons of whores,] For such have been always esteemed the ablest supports of the Throne of Dulness, even by the confession of those her most legitimate Sons, who have unfortunately wanted that advantage. The illustrious Vanini in his divine encomium on our Goddess, intitled De Admirandis Naturæ Reginæ Deæque mortalium Arcanis, laments that he was not born a Bastard: O utinam extra legitimum ac connubialem thorum essem procreatus! &amp;c. He expatiates on the prerogatives of a free birth, and on what he would have done for the Great Mother with those advantages; and then sorrowfully concludes, At quia Conjugatorum sum soboles his orbatus sum bonis.So may the sons of sons of sons of whores, Prop thine, O Empress! like each neighbour Throne, And make a long Posterity thy own. Pleas'd, she accepts the Hero, and the Dame, Wraps in her Veil, and frees from sense of Shame. Then look'd, and saw a lazy, lolling sort, Unseen at Church, at Senate, or at Court, Of ever-listless Loit'rers, that attend No Cause, no Trust, no Duty, and no Friend. Remarks. Ver. 341. Thee too, my Paridel!] The Poet seems to speak of this young gentleman with great affection. The name is taken from Spenser, who gives it to a wandering Courtly 'Squire, that travell'd about for the same reason, for which many young Squires are now fond of travelling, and especially to Paris.Thee too, my Paridel! she mark'd thee there, Remarks. Ver. 342, &amp;c. Stretch'd on the rack—And heard, &amp;c.] Virg. Æn. vi. Sedet, æternumque sedebit, Infelix Theseus, Phlegyasque miserrimus omnes Admonet ?Stretch'd on the rack of a too easy chair, And heard thy everlasting yawn confess The Pains and Penalties of Idleness. She pity'd! but her Pity only shed Benigner influence on thy nodding head. Remarks. Ver. 347. Annius,] The name taken from Annius the Monk of Viterbo, famous for many Impositions and Forgeries of ancient manuscripts and inscriptions, which he was prompted to by mere Vanity, but our Annius had a more substantial motive.But Annius, crafty Seer, with ebon wand, And well dissembled em'rald on his hand, False as his Gems, and canker'd as his Coins, Came, cramm'd with capon, from where Pollio dines. Soft, as the wily Fox is seen to creep, Where bask on sunny banks the simple sheep, Walk round and round, now prying here, now there; So he; but pious, whisper'd first his pray'r. Remarks. Ver. 355. grant me still to cheat!—O may thy cloud still cover the deceit!] Hor. ? Da, pulchra Laverna, Da mihi fallere ? Noctem peccatis &amp; fraudibus objice nubem. Ibid. still to cheat,] Some read skill, but that is frivolous, for Annius hath that skill already; or if he had not, skill were not wanting to cheat such persons. Bentl.Grant, gracious Goddess! grant me still to cheat, O may thy cloud still cover the deceit! Thy choicer mists on this assembly shed, But pour them thickest on the noble head. So shall each youth, assisted by our eyes, See other Cæsars, other Homers rise; Remarks. Ver. 361. hunt th'Athenian fowl,] The Owl stamp'd on the reverse of the ancient money of Athens. Which Chalcis Gods, and Mortals call an Owl is the verse by which Hobbes renders that of Homer, ??????? ??????????? ????, ?????? ?? ????????.Thro' twilight ages hunt th'Athenian fowl, Which Chalcis Gods, and mortals call an Owl, Remarks. Ver. 363. Attys and Cecrops.] The first Kings of Athens, of whom it is hard to suppose any Coins are extant; but not so improbable as what follows, that there should be any of Mahomet, who forbad all Images. Nevertheless one of these Annius's made a counterfeit one, now in the collection of a learned Nobleman.Now see an Attys, now a Cecrops clear, Nay, Mahomet! the Pigeon at thine ear; Be rich in ancient brass, tho' not in gold, And keep his Lares, tho' his house be sold; To headless Phœbe his fair bride postpone, Honour a Syrian Prince above his own; Lord of an Otho, if I vouch it true; Blest in one Niger, till he knows of two. Remarks. Ver. 371. Mummius] This name is not merely an allusion to the Mummies he was so fond of, but probably referred to the Roman General of that name, who burn'd Corinth, and committed the curious Statues to the Captain of a Ship, assuring him, “that if any were lost or broken, he should procure others to be made in their stead:” by which it should seem (whatever may be pretended) that Mummius was no Virtuoso.Mummius o'erheard him; Mummius, Fool-renown'd, Remarks. Ver. 372. Cheops] A King of Egypt, whose body was certainly to be known, as being buried alone in his Pyramid, and is therefore more genuine than any of the Cleopatra's. This Royal Mummy, being stolen by a wild Arab, was purchas'd by the Consul of Alexandria, and transmitted to the Museum of Mummius; for proof of which he brings a passage in Sandys's Travels, where that accurate and learned Voyager assures us that he saw the Sepulchre empty, which agrees exactly (saith he) with the time of the theft above mention'd. But he omits to observe that Herodotus tells the same thing of it in his time.Who like his Cheops stinks above the ground, Fierce as a startled Adder, swell'd, and said, Rattling an ancient Sistrum at his head. Remarks. Ver. 375. Speak'st thou of Syrian Princes? &amp;c.] The strange story following which may be taken for a fiction of the Poet, is justified by a true relation in Spon's Voyages. Vaillant (who wrote the History of the Syrian Kings as it is to be found on medals) coming from the Levant, where he had been collecting various Coins, and being pursued by a Corsaire of Sallee, swallowed down twenty gold medals. A sudden Bourasque freed him from the Rover, and he got to land with them in his belly. On his road to Avignon he met two Physicians, of whom he demanded assistance. One advis'd Purgations, the other Vomits. In this uncertainty he took neither, but pursued his way to Lyons, where he found his ancient friend, the famous Physician and Antiquary Dufour, to whom he related his adventure. Dufour first ask'd him whether the Medals were of the higher Empire? He assur'd him they were. Dufour was ravish'd with the hope of possessing such a treasure, he bargain'd with him on the spot for the most curious of them, and was to recover them at his own expence.Speak'st thou of Syrian Princes? Traitor base! Mine, Goddess! mine is all the horned race. True, he had wit, to make their value rise; From foolish Greeks to steal them, was as wise; More glorious yet, from barb'rous hands to keep, When Sallee Rovers chac'd him on the deep.

The Goddess smiling seem'd to give consent; So back to Pollio, hand in hand, they went. Remarks. Ver. 397. Then thick as locusts black'ning all the ground,] The similitude of Locusts does not refer more to the numbers than to the qualities of the Virtuosi: who not only devour and lay waste every tree, shrub, and green leaf in their Course, i. e. of experiments; but suffer neither a moss nor fungus to escape untouched. Scribl.Then thick as Locusts black'ning all the ground, A tribe, with weeds and shells fantastic crown'd, Each with some wond'rous gift approach'd the Pow'r, A Nest, a Toad, a Fungus, or a Flow'r. But far the foremost, two, with earnest zeal, And aspect ardent to the Throne appeal. The first thus open'd: Hear thy suppliant's call, Great Queen, and common Mother of us all! Imitations. Ver. 405. Fair from its humble bed, &amp;c] ? nam'd it Caroline: Each Maid cry'd, charming! and each Youth, divine! Now prostrate! dead! behold that Caroline: No Maid cries, charming! and no Youth, divine! These Verses are translated from Catullus, Epith. Ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis, Quam mulcent auræ, firmat Sol, educat imber, Multi illum pueri, multæ optavere puellæ: Idem quum tenui carptus defloruit ungui, Nulli illum pueri, nullæ optavere puellæ, &amp;c.Fair from its humble bed I rear'd this Flow'r, Suckled, and chear'd, with air, and sun, and show'r, Soft on the paper ruff its leaves I spread, Bright with the gilded button tipt its head, Remarks. Ver. 409. and nam'd it Caroline:] It is a compliment which the Florists usually pay to Princes and great persons, to give their names to the most curious Flowers of their raising: Some have been very jealous of vindicating this honour, but none more than that ambitious Gardiner at Hammersmith, who caused his Favourite to be painted on his Sign, with this inscription, This is My Queen Caroline.Then thron'd in glass, and nam'd it Caroline: Each Maid cry'd, charming! and each Youth, divine! Did Nature's pencil ever blend such rays, Such vary'd light in one promiscuous blaze? Now prostrate! dead! behold that Caroline: No Maid cries, charming! and no Youth, divine! And lo the wretch! whose vile, whose insect lust Lay'd this gay daughter of the Spring in dust. Oh punish him, or to th'Elysian shades Dismiss my soul, where no Carnation fades. He ceas'd, and wept. With innocence of mien, Th'Accus'd stood forth, and thus address'd the Queen. Imitations. Ver. 421. Of all th'enamel'd race,] The poet seems to have an eye to Spenser, Muiopotmos. Of all the race of silver-winged Flies Which do possess the Empire of the Air.Of all th'enamel'd race, whose silv'ry wing Waves to the tepid Zephyrs of the spring, Or swims along the fluid atmosphere, Once brightest shin'd this child of Heat and Air.

At last it fix'd, 'twas on what plant it pleas'd, And where it fix'd, the beauteous bird I seiz'd: Rose or Carnation was below my care; I meddle, Goddess! only in my sphere. I tell the naked fact without disguise, And, to excuse it, need but shew the prize; Whose spoils this paper offers to your eye, Fair ev'n in death! this peerless Butterfly. My sons!

Remarks. Ver. 453. O! would the Sons of men, &amp;c.] This is the third speech of the Goddess to her Supplicants, and completes the whole of what she had to give in instruction on this important occasion, concerning Learning, Civil Society, and Religion. In the first speech, ver. 119, to her Editors and conceited Critics, she directs how to deprave Wit and discredit fine Writers. In her second, ver. 175, to the Educators of Youth, she shews them how all Civil Duties may be extinguish'd, in that one doctrine of divine Hereditary Right. And in this third, she charges the Investigators of Nature to amuse themselves in Trifles, and rest in Second causes, with a total disregard of the First. This being all that Dulness can wish, is all she needs to say; and we may apply to her (as the Poet hath manag'd it) what hath been said of true Wit, that She neither says too little, nor too much.O! would the Sons of Men once think their Eyes And Reason giv'n them but to study Flies! See Nature in some partial narrow shape, And let the Author of the Whole escape: Learn but to trifle; or, who most observe, To wonder at their Maker, not to serve. Remarks. Ver. 459. a gloomy Clerk,] The Epithet gloomy in this line may seem the same with that of dark in the next. But gloomy relates to the uncomfortable and disastrous condition of an irreligious Sceptic, whereas dark alludes only to his puzzled and embroiled Systems.Be that my task (replies a gloomy Clerk, Sworn foe to Myst'ry, yet divinely dark; Whose pious hope aspires to see the day Remarks. Ver. 462. When Moral Evidence shall quite decay,] Alluding to a ridiculous and absurd way of some Mathematicians, in calculating the gradual decay of Moral Evidence by mathematical proportions: according to which calculation, in about fifty years it will be no longer probable that Julius Cæsar was in Gaul, or died in the Senate House. See Craig's Theologiæ Christianæ Principia Mathematica. But as it seems evident, that facts of a thousand years old, for instance, are now as probable as they were five hundred years ago; it is plain that if in fifty more they quite disappear, it must be owing, not to their Arguments, but to the extraordinary Power of our Goddess; for whose help therefore they have reason to pray.When Moral Evidence shall quite decay, And damns implicit faith, and holy lies, Prompt to impose, and fond to dogmatize:) Remarks. Ver. 465–68. Let others creep—thro' Nature led.] In these lines are described the Disposition of the rational Inquirer, and the means and end of Knowledge. With regard to his disposition, the contemplation of the works of God with human faculties, must needs make a modest and sensible man timorous and fearful; and that will naturally direct him to the right means of acquiring the little knowledge his faculties are capable of, namely plain and sure experience; which tho' supporting only an humble foundation, and permitting only a very slow progress, yet leads, surely, to the end, the discovery of the God of nature.Let others creep by timid steps, and slow, On plain Experience lay foundations low, By common sense to common knowledge bred, And last, to Nature's Cause thro' Nature led. All-seeing in thy mists, we want no guide, Mother of Arrogance, and Source of Pride! Remarks. Ver. 471. the high Priori Road,] Those who, from the effects in this Visible world, deduce the Eternal Power and Godhead of the First Cause tho' they cannot attain to an adequate idea of the Deity, yet discover so much of him, as enables them to see the End of their Creation, and the Means of their Happiness: whereas they who take this high Priori Road (such as Hobbs, Spinoza, Des Cartes, and some better Reasoners) for one that goes right, ten lose themselves in Mists, or ramble after Visions which deprive them of all sight of their End, and mislead them in the choice of wrong means.We nobly take the high Priori Road, Remarks. Ver. 472. And reason downward, till we doubt of God.] This was in fact the case of those who, instead of reasoning from a visible World to an invisible God, took the other road; and from an invisible God (to whom they had given attributes agreeable to certain metaphysical principles formed out of their own imaginations) reasoned downwards to a visible world in theory, of Man's Creation; which not agreeing, as might be expected, to that of God's, they began, from their inability to account for evil which they saw in his world, to doubt of that God, whose being they had admitted, and whose attributes they had deduced a priori, on weak and mistaken principles.And reason downward, till we doubt of God: Remarks. Ver. 473. Make Nature still] This relates to such as being ashamed to assert a mere Mechanic Cause, and yet unwilling to forsake it intirely, have had recourse to a certain Plastic Nature, Elastic Fluid, Subtile Matter, &amp;c.Make Nature still incroach upon his plan; And shove him off as far as e'er we can: Remarks. Ver. 475. Thrust some Mechanic Cause into his place, Or bind in Matter, or diffuse in Space.] The first of these Follies is that of Des Cartes, the second of Hobbs, the third of some succeeding Philosophers.Thrust some Mechanic Cause into his place; Or bind in Matter, or diffuse in Space. Remarks. Ver. 477. Or, at one bound, &amp;c.] These words are very significant: In their Physical and Metaphysical reasonings it was a Chain of pretended Demonstrations that drew them into all these absurd conclusions. But their errors in Morals rest only on bold and impudent Assertions, without the least shadow of proof, in which they o'er-leap all the laws of Argument as well as Truth.Or, at one bound o'er-leaping all his laws, Remarks. Ver. 478, &amp;c. Make God Man's Image, Man the final Cause, Find Virtue local, all Relation scorn, See all in Self ?] Here the Poet, from the errors relating to a Deity in Natural Philosophy, descends to those in Moral. Man was made according to God's Image; this false Theology, measuring his Attributes by ours, makes God after Man's Image. This proceeds from the imperfection of his Reason. The next, of imagining himself the Final Cause, is the effect of his Pride: as the making Virtue and Vice arbitrary, and Morality the imposition of the Magistrate, is of the Corruption of his heart. Hence he centers every thing in himself. The Progress of Dulness herein differing from that of Madness; one ends in seeing all in God, the other in seeing all in Self.Make God Man's Image, Man the final Cause, Find Virtue local, all Relation scorn, See all in Self, and but for self be born: Remarks. Ver. 481. Of nought so certain as our Reason still.] Of which we have most cause to be diffident. Of nought so doubtful as of Soul and Will: two things the most self-evident, the Existence of our Soul, and the Freedom of our Will.Of nought so certain as our Reason still, Of nought so doubtful as of Soul and Will. Oh hide the God still more! and make us see Remarks. Ver. 484. Such as Lucretius drew,] Lib. 1. ver. 57. Omnis enim per se Divom natura necesse'st Immortali ævo summa cum pace fruatur, Semota ab nostris rebus, summotaque longe— Nec bene pro meritis capitur, nec tangitur ira. From whence the two verses following are translated, and wonderfully agree with the character of our Goddess. Scribl.Such as Lucretius drew, a God like Thee: Wrapt up in Self, a God without a Thought, Regardless of our merit or default. Remarks. Ver. 487. Or that bright Image] Bright Image was the Title given by the later Platonists to that Idea of Nature, which they had form'd in their fancy, so bright, that they call'd it ????????)/ ??????, or the Self-seen Image, i. e. seen by its own light.Or that bright Image to our fancy draw, Remarks. Ver. 488. Which Theocles in raptur'd Vision saw.] Thus this Philosopher calls upon his Friend, to partake with him in these Visions: “To-morrow, when the Eastern Sun “With his first Beams adorns the front “Of yonder Hill, if you're content “To wander with me in the Woods you see, “We will pursue those Loves of ours, “By favour of the Sylvan Nymphs: and invoking first the Genius of the Place, we'll try to obtain at least some faint and distant view of the Sovereign Genius and first Beauty.” Charact. Vol. 2. pag. 245. This Genius is thus apostrophized (pag. 345.) by the same Philosopher: “? O glorious Nature! “Supremely fair, and sovereignly good! “All-loving, and all-lovely! all divine! “Wise Substitute of Providence! impower'd “Creatress! or impow'ring Deity, “Supreme Creator! “Thee I invoke, and thee alone adore. Sir Isaac Newton distinguishes between these two in a very different manner. [Princ. Schol. gen. sub fin.] —Hunc cognoscimus solummodo per proprietates suas &amp; attributa, &amp; per sapientissimas &amp; optimas rerum structuras, &amp; causas finales; veneramur autem &amp; colimus ob dominium.

Ver. 489. roves,—Or wanders wild in Acadenic Groves.] “Above all things I lov'd Ease, and of all Philosophers those who reason'd most at their Ease, and were never angry or disturb'd, as those call'd Sceptics never were.

Bland and familiar to the throne he came, Led up the Youth, and call'd the Goddess Dame. Remarks. Ver. 499, 500. —From Priest-craft happily set free, Lo! ev'ry finish'd Son returns to thee:] The learned Scriblerus is here very whimsical. It would seem, says he, by this, as if the Priests (who are always plotting and contriving mischief against the Law of Nature) had inveigled these harmless Youths from the bosom of their Mother, and kept them in open Rebellion to her, till Silenus broke the charm, and restored them to her indulgent arms. But this is so singular a fancy, and at the same time so unsupported by proof, that we must in justice acquit them of all suspicions of this kind.Then thus. From Priest-craft happily set free, Lo! ev'ry finish'd Son returns to thee: Remarks. Ver. 501. First slave to Words, &amp;c.] A Recapitulation of the whole Course of Modern Education describ'd in this book, which confines Youth to the study of Words only in Schools, subjects them to the authority of Systems in the Universities, and deludes them with the names of Party-distinctions in the World. All equally concurring to narrow the Understanding, and establish Slavery and Error in Literature, Philosophy, and Politics. The whole finished in modern Free-thinking; the completion of whatever is vain, wrong, and destructive to the happiness of mankind, as it establishes Self-love for the sole Principle of Action.First slave to Words, then vassal to a Name, Then dupe to Party; child and man the same; Bounded by Nature, narrow'd still by Art, A trifling head, and a contracted heart. Thus bred, thus taught, how many have I seen, Smiling on all, and smil'd on by a Queen. Mark'd out for Honours, honour'd for their Birth, To thee the most rebellious things on earth: Now to thy gentle shadow all are shrunk, All melted down, in Pension, or in Punk! So K? so B? sneak'd into the grave, A Monarch's half, and half a Harlot's slave. Poor W? nipt in Folly's broadest bloom, Who praises now? his Chaplain on his Tomb. Then take them all, oh take them to thy breast! Thy Magus, Goddess! shall perform the rest. Remarks. Ver. 517. With that a Wizard old, &amp;c.] Here beginneth the celebration of the greater Mysteries of the Goddess, which the Poet in his Invocation ver. 5. promised to sing. For when now each Aspirant, as was the custom, had proved his qualification and claim to a participation, the High-Priest of Dulness first initiateth the Assembly by the usual way of Libation. And then each of the Initiated, as was always required, putteth on a new Nature, described from ver. 518 to 529. When the High-Priest and Goddess have thus done their parts, each of them is delivered into the hands of his Conductor, an inferior Minister or Hierophant, whose names are Impudence, Stupesaction, Self-conceit, Self-interest, Pleasure, Epicurism, &amp;c. to lead them thro' the several apartments of her Mystic Dome or Palace. When all this is over, the sovereign Goddess, from ver. 565 to 600 conferreth her Titles and Degrees; rewards inseparably attendant on the participation of the Mysteries; which made the ancient Theon say of them—???????? ??? ???, ??? ??? ???????? ??????, ?? ????????? ????????. Hence being enriched with so many various Gifts and Graces, Initiation into the Mysteries was anciently, as well as in these our times, esteemed a necessary qualification for every high office and employment, whether in Church or State. Lastly the great Mother shutteth up the Solemnity with her gracious benediction, which concludeth in drawing the Curtain, and laying all her Children to rest. It is to be observed that Dulness, before this her Restoration, had her Pontiffs in Partibus; who from time to time held her Mysteries in secret, and with great privacy. But now, on her Re-establishment, she celebrateth them, like those of the Cretans (the most ancient of all Mysteries) in open day, and offereth them to the inspection of all men. Scribl. Remarks. Ver. 517. his Cup,—Which whoso tastes, &amp;c.] The Cup of Self-love, which causes a total oblivion of the obligations of Friendship, or Honour, and of the Service of God or our Country; all sacrificed to Vain-glory, Court-worship, or yet meaner considerations of Lucre and brutal Pleasures. From ver. 520 to 528.With that, a Wizard old his Cup extends; Imitations. Ver. 518. Which whoso tastes, forgets his former friends,—Sire, &amp;c] Homer of the Nepenthe, Odyss. 4. ?????) ?? ??? ????? ???? ????????, ????? ?????? ???????? ?? ?????? ??, ????? ???????? ???????.Which whoso tastes, forgets his former friends, Sire, Ancestors, Himself. One casts his eyes Up to a Star, and like Endymion dies: A Feather shooting from another's head, Extracts his brain, and Principle is fled, Remarks. Ver. 523, 524. Lost is his God, his Country—And nothing left but Homage to a King.] So strange as this must seem to a mere English reader, the famous Mons. de la Bruyere declares it to be the character of every good Subject in a Monarchy: “Where (says he) there is no such thing as Love of our Country, the Interest, the Glory and Service of the Prince supply its place.” De la Republique, Chap. 10.Lost is his God, his Country, ev'ry thing; And nothing left but Homage to a King! The vulgar herd turn off to roll with Hogs, To run with Horses, or to hunt with Dogs; But, sad example! never to escape Remarks. Ver. 528. still keep the human shape.] The Effects of the Magus's Cup are just contrary to that of Circe. Hers took away the shape, and left the human mind: This takes away the mind, and leaves the human shape.Their Infamy, still keep the human shape. Remarks. Ver. 529. But she, good Goddess, &amp;c.] The only comfort such people can receive, must be owing in some shape or other to Dulness; which makes some stupid, others impudent, gives Self-conceit to some, upon the Flatteries of their dependants, presents the false colours of Interest to others, and busies or amuses the rest with idle Pleasures or Sensuality, till they become easy under any infamy. Each of which species is here shadowed under Allegorical persons.But she, good Goddess, sent to ev'ry child Firm Impudence, or Stupefaction mild; And strait succeeded, leaving shame no room, Cibberian forehead, or Cimmerian gloom. Kind Self-conceit to some her glass applies, Which no one looks in with another's eyes: But as the Flatt'rer or Dependant paint, Beholds himself a Patriot, Chief, or Saint. On others Int'rest her gay liv'ry flings, Int'rest, that waves on Party-colour'd wings: Turn'd to the Sun, she casts a thousand dyes, And, as she turns, the colours fall or rise. Others the Syren Sisters warble round, And empty heads console with empty sound. No more, alas! the voice of Fame they hear, Remarks. Ver. 544. The balm of Dulness] The true Balm of Dulness, called by the Greek Physicians ????????, is a Sovereign remedy, and has its name from the Goddess herself. Its ancient Dispensators were her Poets; but it is now got into as many hands as Goddard's Drops or Daffy's Elixir. It is prepared by the Clergy, as appears from several places of this poem: And by ver. 534, 535, it seems as if the Nobility had it made up in their own houses. This, which Opera is here said to administer, is but a spurious sort. See my Dissertation on the Silphium of the Antients. Bent.The balm of Dulness trickling in their ear. Great C?, H?, P?, R?, K?, Why all your Toils? your Sons have learn'd to sing. How quick Ambition hastes to ridicule! The Sire is made a Peer, the Son a Fool.

The board with specious Miracles he loads, &amp;c.] Scriblerus seems at a loss in this place. Speciosa miracula (says he) according to Horace, were the monstrous Fables of the Cyclops, Læstrygons, Scylla, &amp;c. What relation have these to the transformation of Hares into Larks, or of Pigeons into Toads? I shall tell thee. The Læstrygons spitted Men upon Spears, as we do Larks upon Skewers: and the fair Pigeon turn'd to a Toad is similar to the fair Virgin Scylla ending in a filthy beast. But here is the difficulty, why Pigeons in so shocking a shape should be brought to a Table. Hares indeed might be cut into Larks at a second dressing, out of frugality: Yet that seems no probable motive, when we consider the extravagance before mention'd, of dissolving whole Oxen and Boars into a small vial of Jelly; nay it is expresly said, that all Flesh is nothing in his sight. I have searched in Apicius, Pliny, and the Feast of Trimalchio, in vain: I can only resolve it into some mysterious superstitious Rite, as it is said to be done by a Priest, and soon after called a Sacrifice, attended (as all ancient sacrifices were) with Libation and Song. Scribl. This good Scholiast, not being acquainted with modern Luxury, was ignorant that these were only the miracles of French Cookery, and that particularly Pigeons en crapeau were a common dish.The board with specious miracles he loads, Turns Hares to Larks, and Pigeons into Toads.

Ibid. Bladen, &amp;c.] The former Note of Bladen is a black man, is very absurd.

Some, deep Free-Masons, join the silent race] The Poet all along expresses a very particular concern for this silent Race: He has here provided, that in case they will not waken or open (as was before proposed) to a Humming-Bird or Cockle, yet at worst they may be made Free-Masons; where Taciturnity is the only essential Qualification, as it was the chief of the disciples of Pythagoras.Some, deep Free-Masons, join the silent race Worthy to fill Pythagoras's place: Some Botanists, or Florists at the least, Or issue Members of an Annual feast. Nor past the meanest unregarded, one Remarks. Ver. 576. a Gregorian, one a Gormogon.] A sort of Lay-brothers, Slips from the Root of the Free-Masons.Rose a Gregorian, one a Gormogon. The last, not least in honour or applause, Isis and Cam made Doctors of her Laws. Then blessing all, Go Children of my care! To Practice now from Theory repair. Remarks. Ver. 581. All my commands are easy, short, and full: My Sons be proud, be selfish, and be dull. ] We should be unjust to the reign of Dulness not to confess that her's has one advantage in it rarely to be met with in Modern Governments, which is, that the public Education of her Youth fits and prepares them for the observance of her Laws, and the exertion of those Virtues she recommends. For what makes men prouder than the empty knowledge of Words; more selfish than the Free-thinker's System of Morals; or duller than the profession of true Virtuosoship? Nor are her Institutions less admirable in themselves than in the fitness of these their several relations, to promote the harmony of the whole. For she tells her Sons, and with great truth, that “all her commands are easy, short, and full.” For is any thing in nature more easy than the exertion of Pride, more short and simple than the principle of Selfishness, or more full and ample than the sphere of Dulness? Thus Birth, Education, and wise Policy all concurring to support the throne of our Goddess, great must be the strength thereof.All my commands are easy, short, and full: My Sons! be proud, be selfish, and be dull. Guard my Prerogative, assert my Throne: Remarks. Ver. 584. each Privilege your own, &amp;c.] This speech of Dulness to her Sons at parting may possibly fall short of the Reader's expectation; who may imagine the Goddess might give them a Charge of more consequence, and, from such a Theory as is before delivered, incite them to the practice of something more extraordinary, than to personate Running-Foot-men, Jockeys, Stage Coachmen, &amp;c. But if it be well consider'd, that whatever inclination they might have to do mischief, her sons are generally render'd harmless by their Inability; and that it is the common effect of Dulness (even in her greatest efforts) to defeat her own design; the Poet, I am persuaded, will be justified, and it will be allow'd that these worthy persons, in their several ranks, do as much as can be expected from them.This Nod confirms each Privilege your own. The Cap and Switch be sacred to his Grace; With Staff and Pumps the Marquis lead the Race; From Stage to Stage the licens'd Earl may run, Pair'd with his Fellow-Charioteer the Sun; The learned Baron Butterflies design, Remarks.

Perhaps more high some daring son may soar, Proud to my list to add one Monarch more; And nobly conscious, Princes are but things Born for First Ministers, as Slaves for Kings, Tyrant supreme! shall three Estates command, And make one Mighty Dunciad of the Land! More she had spoke, but yawn'd—All Nature nods: Remarks. Ver. 606. What Mortal can resist the Yawn of Gods?] This verse is truly Homerical; as is the conclusion of the Action, where the great Mother composes all, in the same manner as Minerva at the period of the Odyssey.—It may indeed seem a very singular Epitasis of a Poem, to end as this does, with a Great Yawn; but we must consider it as the Yawn of a God, and of powerful effects. It is not out of Nature, most long and grave counsels concluding in this very manner: Nor without Authority, the incomparable Spencer having ended one of the most considerable of his works with a Roar, but then it is the Roar of a Lion, the effects whereof are described as the Catastrophe of his Poem.What Mortal can resist the Yawn of Gods? Remarks. Ver. 607. Churches and Chapels, &amp;c.] The Progress of this Yawn is judicious, natural, and worthy to be noted. First it seizeth the Churches and Chapels; then catcheth the Schools, where, tho' the boys be unwilling to sleep, the Masters are not: Next Westminster-hall, much more hard indeed to subdue, and not totally put to silence even by the Goddess: Then the Convocation, which tho' extremely desirous to speak, yet cannot: Even the House of Commons, justly called the Sense of the Nation, is lost (that is to say suspended) during the Yawn (far be it from our Author to suggest it could be lost any longer!) but it spreadeth at large over all the rest of the Kingdom, to such a degree, that Palinurus himself (tho' as incapable of sleeping as Jupiter) yet noddeth for a moment: the effect of which, tho' ever so momentary, could not but cause some Relaxation, for the time, in all public affairs. Scribl.Churches and Chapels instantly it reach'd; Remarks. Ver. 608. leader] An Epithet from the Age she had just then restored, according to that sublime custom of the Easterns, in calling new-born Princes after some great and recent Event. Scribl.(St. James's first, for leaden Gilbert preach'd) Then catch'd the Schools; the Hall scarce kept awake; Remarks. Ver. 610. The Convocation gap'd, but could not speak:] Implying a great desire so to do, as the learned Scholiast on the place rightly observes. Therefore beware Reader lest thou take this Gape for a Yawn, which is attended with no desire but to go to rest: by no means the disposition of the Convocation; whose melancholy case in short is this: She was, it is reported, infected with the general influence of the Goddess, and while she was yawning at her ease, a wanton Courtier took her at this advantage, and in the very nick clap'd a Gag into her mouth. Well therefore may she be distinguished by her gaping; and this distressful posture it is our poet would describe, just as she stands at this day, a sad example of the effects of Dulness and Malice unchecked and despised. Bent.The Convocation gap'd, but could not speak: Lost was the Nation's Sense, nor could be found, While the long solemn Unison went round: Wide, and more wide, it spread o'er all the realm; Remarks. Ver. 614, 618.] These Verses were written many years ago, and may be found in the State Poems of that time. So that Scriblerus is mistaken, or whoever else have imagined this Poem of a fresher date.Ev'n Palinurus nodded at the Helm: The Vapour mild o'er each Committee crept; Unfinish'd Treaties in each Office slept; And Chiefless Armies doz'd out the Campaign; And Navies yawn'd for Orders on the Main. O Muse! relate (for you can tell alone, Remarks. Ver. 620. Wits have short Memories,] This seems to be the reason why the Poets, whenever they give us a Catalogue, constantly call for help on the Muses, who, as the Daughters of Memory, are obliged not to forget any thing. So Homer, Iliad 2. ?????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?????????, ???? ???????, ?? ?? ??????????, ??????, ???? ????????? ?????????, ?????????? ? And Virgil. Æn. 7. Et meministis enim, Divæ, &amp; memorare potestis: Ad nos vix tenuis famæ perlabitur aura. But our Poet had yet another reason for putting this Task upon the Muse, that all besides being asleep, she only could relate what passed. Scribl.Wits have short Memories, and Dunces none) Relate, who first, who last resign'd to rest; Whose Heads she partly, whose completely blest; What Charms could Faction, what Ambition lull, Remarks. Ver. 624. The Venal quiet, and intrance the Dull;] It would be a Problem worthy the solution of Aristarchus himself, and (perhaps not of less importance than some of those weighty questions so long and warmly disputed amongst Homer's Scholiasts, as, in which hand Venus was wounded, and what Jupiter whisper'd in the ear of Juno) to inform us, which required the greatest effort of our Goddess's power, to intrance the Dull, or to quiet the Venal. For tho' the Venal may be more unruly than the Dull, yet, on the other hand, it demands a much greater expence of her Virtue to intrance than barely to quiet. Scribl.The Venal quiet, and intrance the Dull; 'Till drown'd was Sense, and Shame, and Right, and Wrong— O sing, and hush the Nations with thy Song! In vain, in vain,—the all-composing Hour Resistless falls: The Muse obeys the Pow'r. Remarks. Ver. 629. the sable Throne behold] The sable Thrones of Night and Chaos, here represented as advancing to extinguish the light of the Sciences, in the first place blot out the Colours of Fancy, and damp the Fire of Wit, before they proceed to their greater work.She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold Of Night Primæval, and of Chaos old! Before her, Fancy's gilded clouds decay, And all its varying Rain-bows die away. Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires, The meteor drops, and in a flash expires. As one by one, at dread Medea's strain, The sick'ning stars fade off th'ethereal plain; Imitations. Ver. 637. As Argus eyes, &amp;c.] Et quamvis sopor est oculorum parte receptus, Parte tamen vigilat ? ? Vidit Cyllenius omnes Succubuisse oculos, &amp;c. Ovid, Met. 2.As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand opprest, Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest; Thus at her felt approach, and secret might, Art after Art goes out, and all is Night. Remarks. Ver. 641. Truth to her old Cavern fled,] Alluding to the saying of Democritus, That Truth lay at the bottom of a deep well, from whence he had drawn her: Though Butler says, He first put her in, before he drew her out.See skulking Truth to her old Cavern fled, Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head! Remarks. Ver. 643. Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n] Philosophy has at length brought things to that pass, as to have it esteemed unphilosophical to rest in the first cause; as if its ends were an endless indagation of cause after cause, without ever coming to the first. So that to avoid this unlearned disgrace, some of the propagators of our best philosophy have had recourse to the contrivance here hinted at. For this Philosophy, which is founded in the principle of Gravitation, first considered that property in matter, as something extrinsical to it, and impressed immediately by God upon it. Which fairly and modestly coming up to the first Cause, was pushing natural enquiries as far as they should go. But this stopping, though at the extent of our ideas, was mistaken by foreign Philosophers as recurring to the occult qualities of the Peripatetics. To avoid which imaginary discredit to the new theory, it was thought proper to seek for the cause of gravitation in a certain elastic fluid, which pervaded all body. By this means, instead of really advancing in natural enquiries, we were brought back again by this ingenious expedient to an unsatisfactory second cause: For it might still, by the same kind of objection, be asked, what was the cause of that elasticity? See this folly censured, ver. 475. Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n before, Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more. Remarks. Ver. 645, 646. Physic of Metaphysic, &amp;c.—And Metaphysic calls, &amp;c.] Certain writers, as Malbranch, Norris, and others, have thought it of importance, in order to secure the existence of the soul, to bring in question the reality of body; which they have attempted to do by a very refined metaphysical reasoning: While others of the same party, in order to persuade us of the necessity of a Revelation which promises immortality, have been as anxious to prove that those qualities which are commonly supposed to belong only to an immaterial Being, are but the result from the sensations of matter, and the soul naturally mortal. Thus between these different reasonings, they have left us neither Soul nor Body: nor the Sciences of Physics and Metaphysics the least support, by making them depend upon and go a begging to one another. Physic of Metaphysic begs defence, And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense! Remarks. Ver. 647. See Mystery to Metaphysics fly!] A sort of men (who make human Reason the adequate measure of all Truth) having pretended that whatsoever is not fully comprehended by it, is contrary to it; certain defenders of Religion, who would not be outdone in a paradox, have gone as far in the opposite folly, and attempted to shew that the mysteries of Religion may be mathematically demonstrated; as the authors of Philosophic, or Astronomic Principles, natural and reveal'd.See Mystery to Mathematics fly! In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die. Remarks. Ver. 649. Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,] Blushing, not only at the view of these her false supports in the present overflow of dulness, but at the memory of the past; when the barbarous learning of so many ages was solely employed in corrupting the simplicity, and defiling the purity of Religion. Amidst the extinction of all other Lights, she is said only to withdraw hers; as hers alone in its own nature is unextinguishable and eternal. Religion blushing veils her sacred fires, Remarks. Ver. 650. And unawares Morality expires.] It appears from hence that our Poet was of very different sentiments from the Author of the Characteristics, who has written a formal treatise on Virtue, to prove it not only real but durable, without the support of Religion. The word unawares alludes to the confidence of those men who suppose that Morality would flourish best without it, and consequently to the surprize such would be in (if any such there are) who indeed love Virtue, and yet do all they can to root out the Religion of their Country.And unawares Morality expires. Nor public Flame, nor private, dares to shine; Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse divine! Lo! thy dread Empire, Chaos! is restor'd; Light dies before thy uncreating word: Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall; And Universal Darkness buries All. FINIS.</field>
