      <field name="fulltext">When Parish-Taxes shall be well apply'd, And Vestries lay their costly Feasts aside; Then shall Church-Ward'ns deal justly by the Poor, And be accounted Gutt'ling Knaves no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Parish Gutt'lers: OR, THE Humours of a Select Vestry. As Nations oft by cunning Knaves, Are made consenting Fools and Slaves, And tempted by delusive Arts, To wrong themselves with willing Hearts, Till Poverty creeps on at last, And minds them of their Follies past, Who then to late behold the Craft And Fraud of those they've rais'd aloft; So Vestries that are stil'd Select, Whom many blame, but few respect, Old surly Sots, and greedy Hounds, Whose Wisdom lies in Pence and Pounds, O'er injur'd Parishes preside, And all their suff'ring Neighbours ride, Oppress the Humble, wrong the Poor, And half the Parish-Dues devour, Feast their own Guts, like brawny Boars, And starve their hungry Pensioners, Frequent the Taverns Night and Day, And live in Pomp on Parish-Pay; Surfeit wirh Sausages and Fowls, And drown their poor neglected Souls In costly Wines, which few can drink, But those that deal in publick Chink. Nor are they thus content, alone, To guzzle down what's not their own, But mend their Fortunes, which is worse, By tamp'ring with the Parish-Purse. If Peggy, Betty, Nanny, Kather'n, Or any tallow-fac'd young Slattern, That pines at Heart, and grieves in Thought, For want of knowing what is what; If her old Father's Shop or Stall Stands but without the City-Wall, When he's Church-Ward'n, she need not fear A Husband in that joyful Year; And if a Dowry with his Daughter Be wanting, to cement the Matter, He'll raise a Bag, and richly cloath her, By some damn'd Over-rate or other. Nay! grind the Poor behind the Curtain, Rather than not advance a Fortune. And thus by Rogu'ry and Extortion, Make the whole Parish pay the Portion. So Bakers think it no Collusion, To raise, by way of Contribution, A Sunday's Pudding, by partaking Of ev'ry one that's brought to baking. From Gen'rals, which my sporting Muse Does only as a Proem use, She now descends to stand the Bears, And sing of late Particulars, That Fact may, in some measure, shew Her former Allegations true, And Parishes may see their Rulers Display'd in their Cameleon Colours, Who, Proteus-like, can change their Shapes, To Lyons, Asses, Wolves, or Apes, And for their Int'rest, and their Ease, Imploy two diff'rent Consciences, One very large, to rob the Spittle, The other very dark and little; The most capacious, to be sure, They use when they defraud the Poor, Because they never think, in such Affairs, they serve themselves too much. The same good Conscience gives Directions In all Assessments, and Collections, And dictates what they ought to do, In Vestry, and in Tavern too. In Acts of Friendship, or Compassion, Or Works that merit Commendation, In helping Widows in Distress, Or Orphans in a wretched Case, In serving God, or being just To those for whom they are in Trust, Then little Conscience doth appear, And gives the Rule by which they steer. Yet wise and honest Men deride 'em, Tho' they've two Consciences to guide 'em; Because their Actions shew, in troth, One good one's richly worth 'em both. As Spaniards with two Weapons swagger, A huge long Sword, and little Dagger, With which they guard themselves from Danger, But often wound the peaceful Stranger; So Vestry Bullies, when they please, Misuse their Double Consciences, Secure themselves, and Knaves that love 'em, But injure those that disapprove 'em. As modest Dames, with bashful Faces, When forc'd to speak in bawdy Cases, Make twenty Shuffles to evade Paw Words, which must at last be said: So my poor silly shame-fac'd Muse, Now here SubpÅna'd to accuse A Pack of Sots, and Capon-Eaters, Of many Crimes before their Betters, Seems backward to expose their Failings, As if avers'd to publick Railings. However, since she must declare The Knav'ries of this Grand Affair, She hopes, unblam'd, to say or sing The Truth. And so, GOD save the King. To all wise Men of London Town, And grave old Dunces, be it known, Without that Gate that bears the Title Of Rev'rendâleading to the Spittle, There lies an ancient, ill-pav'd, hobbling Out-Parish, fam'd of late for Squabbling, Which has more Courts and Allies in it, Than I could name by this Day se'ennight, Stuff'd with such People, and such Matter, That would disgrace the lowest Satyr. Not but each open Street abounds With Men of Sense, and Men of Pounds, But Gossips, Trulls, and Marshal's Baili's, Affect to dwell in Nooks and Allies; As Owls, and other Birds of Night, In Barns, and hollow Trees delight. This ancient Parish, partly nam'd Before, for present Discord fam'd, Is wisely govern'd by the Mastry Of those that call themselves a Vestry, Their Number, by their own Accounts, To about Twenty six amounts; A small Detachment out of which, More sly, more crafty, and more rich, Govern the rest by Tavern/Treats, And thus they carry on their Cheats. So Statesmen make whole Nations Fools, When Ays and Noes become their Tools. But whence these modern Vestries, call'd Select, derive the Pow'r they hold, Like many others, I'm inclin'd To think, is difficult to find; Tho', I confess, the most concise Account I ever heard, is this: A certain Goldsmith highly vex'd, To find himself unjustly tax'd, Did to the Parish-Dons complain; But could no Remedy obtain: Which caus'd him, in a scoffing Passion, To vent the following Exclamation. HAVE I, ye Scrubs, for Years untold, In Sterling dealt, and Standard Gold; Made Silver Tankards for your Vict'lers, And Spoons, and Salts, for Parish-Gutt'lers; Sold massy Bowls to grace your Houses, And Tea-Pots to oblige your Spouses; Furnish'd your Daughters, patch'd and painted, With precious Stones, those Toys they wanted; And to their prouder Mothers sold Gilt Watches, that have pass'd for Gold; Adorn'd their Ears with Rings, that ought To've been into their Noses put; And done to gratify your Pride, A Thousand useful Things beside: And must I now, ye Gutt'ling Crew, Be thus impos'd upon by you? From whence do you derive, GOD bless us! The Power to injure, and oppress us? Who conjur'd up that Parish-Sect, A Modern Vestry, call'd Select? An old Rebellious Name ? of late Reviv'd, that stinks of Forty Eight. Of all Tax-Masters you're the worst, A Pack of Tyrants, who were first Chose by the Devil, your eldest Brother, And now you all choose one another. So fare ye well, I'll curb my Tongue, But pray remember whence ye sprung. Demetrius being now withdrawn, And Vestry glad to find him gone, A grave Old Hunx, on this Occasion, Began the following wise Oration. Brethren, I say, on t'other Hand, It may be, you misunderstand The bitter Words this Man has utter'd, Or if you do not, I'll be butter'd; But let me see; where am I got? I say, that is, I vow I'm out; Good Brethren, help me in a little, I know his Meaning to a Tittle: Pray hear me, Sirs, I have spoke before Lord-May'rs, a dozen times, or more, Nay, Judges too, in Days of Yore. But many Words will never fill A Bushel, I remember still; And, therefore, to be short and plain, Must tell you, that this angry Man Is mad he doth not drink and eat His Share of ev'ry Parish-Treat; He means not to affront, or wrong us, But only wants to be among us; And thinks, because we don't invite him To e'ery Banquet, that we slight him: Therefore, in my Opinion, really, My honest Brethren, let me tell ye, The way to stop his clam'ring thus, Is e'en to make him one of us; Observe me, When a Member rails Against the Court he seldom fails Of some Preferment that prevents His further noisy Discontents; And when his Mouth's once stop'd with Riches, Farewell to all his biting Speeches; Therefore take my Advice, you'll find Our Neighbour soon will change his Mind. This florid pertinent Oration, Tho' spoke with no small Hesitation, Prevail'd so greatly with the rest, That the whole Vestry acquiess'd In his Opinion, and agreed To choose, with all convenient speed, Demetrius, knowing no Man fitter, To be install'd a Capon Eater, Who when Elected to the Sweets Of all their costly Parish Treats, Drew in his Horns when thus befriended, And so the mighty Quarrel ended. But finding now himself exalted Above each other Nighbour dolted, And growing proud of his Admission Into this Parish Inquisition, Was ask'd by a familiar Friend, What Notions now he entertain'd Of that Assembly which had been So long the Object of his Spleen. Demetrius with a shaking Head, Reply'd, Ah! Neighbour, what I said Before I knew them, I confess, Was but a wrong, ill-natur'd Guess, I own, I thought 'em then a Crew Of tricking, cheating, Knaves, 'tis true, But now I sit, and vote among 'em, The Lord forbid that I should wrong 'em; I find 'em, as I hope to thrive, The worthy'st Gentlemen alive; I did not think there could have been A Set of such wise, honest Men, I dare to swear they would not hurt A Worm that crawls upon the Dirt, Much less do any publick Wrong to The good old Parish they belong to. HEY day! reply'd his Friend, I find Of late you've strangely chang'd your Mind, It was but t'other Day you nos'd 'em, And as a Pack of Knaves expos'd 'em, But now they've won your good Affection, They're all turn'd Saints since your Election. Whence I conclude this must be true, You've mended them, or they've spoil'd you. Demetrius answer'd, Let 'em be What e'er they would, before they'd me, I can sincerely swear and vow, They're all good honest Mortals now. So Statesmen, out of publick Trust, Count others that are in, unjust; But when themselves are once embrac'd, And chosen in amongst the rest, They often prove as great Transgressors, As those that were their Predecessors. Nor are these Corm'rants of the Parish, Content to guttle, swill, and cherish Their own immod'rate Appetites, With costly Wines, and dainty Bits; But the Church-Ward'n, when e'ery Sinner Has cram'd his stretching Guts at Dinner, Must send the Remnants of each Goose, And other Fragments to his House, Which ought to be at Tavern Door Dispos'd of to the hungry Poor, Beaause their Money often pays Th'Expence of those devouring Days; And therefore, have undoubted Titles At Feasts, to all their broken Vict'als. Nay! if the Wretches had their Due, Should really sit at Table too; For they, whose Money makes the Feast, Should have an ample Share at least. But Slaves and Beggars always must Be wrong'd by those they're forc'd to trust. In Hospitals, if well endow'd, The Stewards all grow Rich and Proud, Whilst the poor Pensioners are fed, With Half their Due of Flesh and Bread, Nay! punish'd, if they scatter Words, Because their Servants are their Lords. Our Parish-Beadles, heretofore, Were Beggars, now they're Men in Pow'r; And, often by the Choice of Fools, Are made illit'rate Constables, Who with their mercenary Staves, Protect Night-walking Sluts, and Knaves For Bribes; and always are as ready T'oppress the Honest, and the Needy. Thus some who wear the Parish-Cloth, Sworn Constables, and Beadles both, Shall make by the Abuse of Pow'r, A Hundred Pounds a Year, or more; And in the Parish take more Freedom, Than those that pay to cloath and feed 'em, Can swear, forswear, present, indict, For Int'rest some, and some for Spight; And as Church-Ward'ns direct their Mouths, Can misapply both Lyes and Truths, To stem the Laws, or puzzle all The Justices at Hicks's-Hall; And by false Oaths convict, or save The poor old Bawd, or guilty Knave; And as their Palms are greas'd, can make Th'Offender either White, or Black. These are the Vestry-Lacquies, dress'd Like Apes, in Hats and Jackets lac'd; That when the Parish-Gluttons meet, O'er Pigs and Geese to swill and eat, Tom Gripe, in all his liv'ry Pomp, May wait at Mr. Church-Ward'ns Rump, And let his Tun-Gut Master see, What 'tis to dine like Quality; Besides, he is a useful Tool, To slide away a good fat Fowl, Or Slice of Ven'son, and a Bottle, To Mr. Church-Warden's Tittle-Tattle, Who sits at Home adorn'd, tho' old, With spreading Hoop, and Chain of Gold, One monstrous wide about her Placket, The other fasten'd by a Locket; As if these Gugaws, which the Fair, Around their Tails and Necks do wear, Are only meant to let us know, Tho' chain'd above, they're loose below. Thus English Wives are for submitting, To wear such Lockets as are fitting; But scorn, like tame Italian Hussies, To suffer their cross jealous Spouses To padlock up their Tuzzy-Muzzies. For British Ladies will defend Their ancient Rights from End to End, And will not be deny'd the Freedom Of Tongue, or Tail, when e're they need 'em. 'Tis true, some Men have been too free Of that dear Blessing, Liberty, And sold their native Rights for less, Than hungry Esau's dainty Mess; Fair Madams, therefore, be no Slaves To selling Fools, or buying Knaves; But wear the Breeches if you can, And tyrannize o'er silly Man, Who sure would, rather of the two, Be govern'd, and enslav'd by you, Than barrack'd by the Lord knows who. Reader, Excuse this short Digression, Forgiveness should succeed Confession. And now my careless Muse, who thus Has been misled by Pegasus, Shall of the Headstrong JadÃ© get Mast'ry, And once more spur her to the Vestry. Where merrily she means to take A transient View, for Justice Sake; That by one Sett of Parish-Rulers, Well painted in their proper Colours, The World may see how Fools are cheated, By Knaves on upper Benches seated, Who of their Betters learn the Way To wrong the Poor as well as they. And if we carefully inspect One modern Vestry, call'd Select, And give the Characters of those That lead the Parish by the Nose, The same may be apply'd to all The Vestries round the City-Wall; For Foxes will be Foxes still, And prey on Geese, live where they will. The first of this selected Crew, That stands expos'd to present View, Is an old hamm'ring Sot that deals In Culinary Utensils; And to indulge us in our Sins, Sells Tavern Pots, and Nipperkins, Huge Member-Mugs, call'd Looking-Glasses, Not for our Faces, but our A??ses; And useful Closet-Pans, design'd To ease us when we're loose behind, Or when venereal Symptoms call us To Breakfast upon Pills, or Bolus. Well may this cunning Fox grow rich, That furnishes both Mouth and Breech, With such Conveniencies that neither Can well be destitute of either. Besides, like Alchymists of old, Transmutes base Metal into Gold, Or can to Silver turn a Jordan, Which others buy to drop a T?d in, And this he does his Foes must own, Without the Philosophick Stone, Which none but South-Sea, to our cost, Could ever find, but now 'tis lost. One Excellency more does lodge in This old Rheumatical Curmudgeon, For tho' he feels in Change of Weather, Th'Effects of Vice and Age together, And hobbles when he creeps about, Like an old Stallion quite worn out; Yet he can act a Comic Part, With so much Nature, mix'd with Art, That all Spectators who behold His Monkey Gestures, now he's old, Must think he had been bred an Actor, Or Andrew to some German Doctor; For no Jack-Pudding, Playhouse Fool, Or Pickl'd-Herring, taught by Rule, Can move more Laughter, gain more Praise, Or from our Pewt'rer win the Bays, Especially, when nicely dress'd In an old Beggar-Woman's Vest, Whose Rags, and Party-colour'd Patches, Should plead for such distressed Wretches, Which none but an unthinking Fool, Would turn to Sport, and Ridicule. However, our wise Common-C?cil, Who drives all Mumpers from his Groundcil, Thinks it an Excellence to play The Begging Part as well as they; And therefore, at a publick Meeting, Thought it of late most wisely fitting, To dress himself in Rags and Tatters, Like one of these poor ancient Creatures, Whose humble Mein, and piteous Tone, Their Cough, and now and then a Groan, He mimick'd so extreamly well, That all allow'd him to excel The archest Fool, or merry Fellow, That e'er appear'd in Red and Yellow: A Talent that might rightly square With a young Rake, or strolling Play'r, But can't in Reason be allow'd A Gift, to make an Elder proud, A Vestry-Don of great Regard, And Common-Council in his Ward; A grave Old-Hunx, that hopes to wear A Chain, and live to be Lord-May'r. What! tho' he did his Servant wed, And finely brought himself to Bed; A Lord-Chief-Justice, to his Fame, Was once so wise to do the same. Therefore that Failing we'll excuse, And leave him to his loving Spouse, A Porter's Relict, who can bear, More active Love than he can spare. The next Caponian Fornicator That claims a Place in this dull Satyr, Is one that wears a Head almost As large as any Bull can boast, Whose spacious Mouth, when e'er it opens At roasted Sirloins, Geese, or Capons, Is so extensive that 'tis fit To gorge a Pound at e'ery Bit; Nor does his Belly shame his Face, But struts with such a Giant's Grace, As if his Guts, for their Relief, Were ne'er without two Stone of Beef, Besides some Pounds of Sausage Links, And white-leg'd Fowls, to stop the Chinks, Wash'd freely down, without all Question, With Quarts of Claret for Digestion. Thus Swills, and Crams, 'till grown a large Fat Monster, at the Parish Charge, As Courtiers grow profusely Great, By Taxes to support the State. Nor can a Bagpige make more Noise, Or drown his loud Stentorian Voice, Which deafens all that hear him Bawl, In Vestry, or in Common-Hall! Nor is he such a gifted Brother, To talk more wisely than another, Because in Sound, and not in Sense, Consists his loud-mouth'd Eloquence. His Charity is something more Than common, to the Parish Poor; For when he was their upper Guardian, Or in that Office call'd Church-Warden, When e'er distressed Objects came To ask Relief, in Heaven's Name, Instead of granting what might ease Their craving, sharp Necessities, He'd with indecent Answers fool 'em, And bow, and cringe to ridicule 'em; Ask 'em what Comfort they could have, Or Bus'ness on this side the Grave, Swearing he'd give 'em Alms to buy Them Coffins, if they wou'd but die. And thus dispatch'd the Sick and Old, Oppress'd with Hunger, and with Cold, Without the least Commiseration Of Objects worthy of Compassion. Such are the Drones that live at Ease, And rule, and ride whole Parishes. Upon a Time when this old Sinner Had over-gorg'd himself at Dinner, And greatly surfeited his Blood, With Fowls too fat, and Wines too good, The Poor grew joyful at his Sickness, And cry'd, Pray GOD increase his Weakness; But fear'd he only was discharging The white-leg'd Capons he'd been gorging, Enquiring daily in the Street, What! has not Old-Nick fetch'd him yet? And thus the Poor were pretty even With him that mock'd both them and Heav'n. This is that famous Maggot-monger, Who'll ne'r be wiser till he's younger; A Leader of the Vestry Crew, And one o'th' Common-Council too, Who close confin'd, for little reason, A Porter middle Leg in Prison; And for dispersing Papers there, Adorn'd with his own Character, Had sent him to that shameful Place, Where Whores beat Hemp, for want of Grace But knotty Tom escap'd that Jayl, By timely putting in good Bail. And thus the Porter, and his Friends Baffl'd his Adversary's Ends. This also was the Vestry-Don, That went of late before Sir John, To back the good Church-Ward'n in Matter Still to be canvas'd by their Betters. To th'Parish-Poor, before my Lord, They seem'd to have a great Regard, And therefore humbly hop'd and pray'd, His wiser Lordship would perswade, Or by the dint of Pow'r command The Overseers, out of hand, T'advance full sixty Pounds, no less, To serve the Poor in their Distress. But their Opponents, Men of Sence, Knowing their Plea was but Pretence, And that their Thirty Pounds a-piece Would half be spent in Pigs, and Geese, Refus'd t'advance so great a Sum, And so our Vestry-Men, hum, drum, Like Blockheads as they went, came home. The next Parochial Capon-Eater, That falls beneath the Lash of Satyr, Is a poor thin-jaw'd, ghastly Soul, That deals in Powder, and in Ball, Not such as bloody Soldiers use In Battle, to destroy their Foes; But wholsome, fragrant, Ammunition, That puts us in a sweet Condition; With which each Tonsor puffs, and cleans Our Wigs, and mundifies our Chins; Such as the sanguine Dame applies, To hide her Carrots from our Eyes, And such as all the cleanly Sex Sweeten their Hair with, and their Necks, And oft correct those Imperfections Which in nice Lovers raise Objections. This mortal Shadow of a Man, Whose Calves a single Hand may span, And whose lank Sides appear as lean As a poor Greyhound's, starv'd within, Tho' by his Belly, one would think He seldom us'd to eat or drink, But like an old dry Stallion looks, As if just risen from a Flux; Yet at a Parish-Feast, where Fowls Are sacrific'd to Kites and Owls, And noble Sirloins grace the Board, With Pigs, and other Dainties stor'd, At such a Meal he'll cram more Pullet, And other Poultry down his Gullet, Than two young Plowmen can devour, After hard Labour, in an Hour: Nor does he fail at such a Meeting, To drink according to his Eating, But in Proportion swills down Claret, Altho' he looks no better for it, Than if for Years he had been fed Scot-like, with Water, and Oat-Bread. So hungry Marriot, at a Meal, Would gorge five Stone of Beef, or Veal; That is, he'd eat twelve Hours, or longer, But ne'er the fatter grow, or stronger. Yet tho' our thin-jaw'd Powder Monkey, When dainty Bits are had for thank ye, Will stuff, and gormandize himself, Like greedy Hound, or rav'nous Wolf, I'th' Time that he presided o'er The Parish, and the Parish-Poor, He took more Caution than was fitting, To keep the last from over-eating; For if Powdero chanc'd to meet A Pensioner, in Lane, or Street, Without a Badge, he'd stop their Pay A Week, and make 'em Fast and Pray, Whilst he himself, without Remorse, Would to the Tavern have Recourse, And there mispending what was theirs, Deserve their Curses, not their Pray'rs. So Parish Rulers often stray From Church upon the Sabbath-Day, To punish e'ery Sot's Offence, Not for the Sin, but sake of Pence; Which, like our Skeleton, they spend I'th' House of some officious Friend; And thus commit, by their Neglect Of Church, worse Ills than they detect. So fare thee well, consumptive Mortal, Too thin and skinny to be Heart-whole, Would'st thou prolong a happy Life, With, once thy Servant, now thy Wife; Which Match, altho' it was no Crime, Postpon'd thy Honours for a time, And kept thee back from having Place A Vestry, to thy great Disgrace,) Take this Advice, swill Punch no more, Spend less, do Justice to the Poor; Nor be by too much Love berest Of that small Modicum that's lest; Thy feeble Loins, and slender Shanks, Were never form'd for am'rous Pranks; And tho' some Women are so fair That Flesh and Blood cannot forbear, Yet Skin and Bones should have a Care. Reader, Pray ope both Eyes and Ears, For now more Noise than Work appears, To one smart Stroke that hits the Nail O'th' Head, he strikes six more that fail, Yet makes th'Imployer pay as much For those that miss, as those that touch This also is a Parish Fox, That dives into the Pauper's Box; A craving mercenary Hunx, That does not only deal in Trunks, But has enlarg'd his noisy Trade To building Houses for the Dead, Which caus'd him to refuse free Quarter To a defunct poor Wretch, a Porter, Because his Brother had allow'd A good Elm Coffin, and a Shrowd; So that the Widow being driven To send back what her Broth'r'd given, Was forc'd to wrap the poor Cadaver, In Shrowd that scarce would hang together, And squeeze her quondam Husband into A Slit-deal-Coffin, old, and thin too, Which must be by the Church-Ward'n found, Before he'd grant the Bury'ng-Ground, For which he did vouchsafe to charge A Price extravagantly large, Having the Parish Purse in hand, To satisfy his own Demand; Which was no sooner made than paid. And thus to propagate his Trade, Wrong'd both the Living and the Dead. Once on a Time he turn'd Upholdster, And slily dealt in Bed and Bolster, Imploying, to his Gain, tho' Shame, His Servant to Appraise the same; By which, some Neighbours do attest, The Parish lost two Thirds at least; But since, he'as justly been rewarded, And by his best of Friends discarded, Who pass'd upon him too severe A Sentence to be mention'd here. Upon a Time when costly Meats And gen'rous Wines at Parish-Treats, Had chear'd his Spirits, warm'd his Veins, And strengthen'd his lascivious Reins, A certain Dame, of courteous Mein, Who had at Pray'rs been often seen, He tempted down into his Cellar, And made her there a Fellow-feeler Of something, which her tender Hand With no small Satisfaction span'd; But kindly off'ring to divide Her Legs against a Coffin side, So check'd her Female Inclinations, That all his pressing Instigations, Could not prevail with pious Dame, To quench his irreligious Flame, Because, as she herself declar'd, Her Lover so confus'd appear'd, And finding at her Back a Coffin, She could not do the Trick for Laughing: Conceiving that he might have found A better Place than under Ground, Among such Emblems of Mortality, To've exercis'd his Immorality. But Lust is of so vile a Nature, 'T has small Regard to Place or Creature. However, Phillis not approving Of such unseemly Coffin-shoving, Gave him the Slip, b'ing nimbly Jointed, And left her Lover disappointed To do, when she was thus sprung from him, What did not very well become him. A fair young Girl, some say a Maid, Much indispos'd, and sick in Bed, Our Knick-knock Warden living near, In Hopes to bury her, went to see her, Pretending kindly to assist Her Soul, as if he'ad been a Priest; But when her weeping Friends were gone, And all, except himself withdrawn, This hopeful Guide began to feel What is not modest to reveal; As if he fancy'd, from his Vileness, The real Cause of all her Illness Lay hid, where Female Honour lies Obscurely fenc'd from human Eyes; Attempted therefore to apply A base, tho' pleasing, Remedy. But she, not able to endure, In Sickness, such a boist'rous Cure, Cry'd out, e're he her Limbs had spread, And scar'd the Doctor from her Bed, Before his Lewdness had inclin'd her To take the Nostrum he design'd her: But she without it soon grew well, And liv'd to broach the merry Tale. To further shew how well he lov'd That Sport which is too much approv'd, His Wife, when living, had a Niece, Esteem'd a very charming Piece. This tempting Blossom of a Maid, Full ripe for Wedlock, tho' unwed, He lov'd, as Fame reports the Matter, Better than if she'ad been his Daughter, Which caus'd some jealous Fools, at last, To fancy that she grew too fast; He therefore fearing it might prove Some dropsical Effects of Love, Thought it right Season to provide her A careful 'Spouse to lie beside her, That tapping in due time might free The Lass from this sad Timpany; At least by Matrimonial cloaking, Prevent the Neighbours further Joking; Accordingly, at length, perswades His Man to wed this Maid of Maids, Who had not many Months enjoy'd The Charms of such a thriving Bride, But she was cur'd, by Means most proper, Us'd by no Quack, but Mother Groper. The Wife, who was before so plump About the Belly, and the Rump, To her fond Husband now appearing As thin as any shotten Herring, He blushing, very angry grew To see his 'Spouse thus split in two, And madly cursing his ill Luck, Transform'd himself into a Buck, Which sudden Change so griev'd his Wise, That she abhorr'd her anxious Life; And flying from her Home, soon a'ter, Forsook the Land for River Water, Wherein she perish'd in Despair, A sad Example to the Fair. When thus she'ad finish'd Female Folly, And gratify'd her Melancholy, Her Corps to'r Uncle was convey'd By whom she'd been unmade a Maid, Who only had one Coach to grace Her Fun'ral, to her Bury'ng-Place, In which he sat, and wept, no doubt, But made the Husband walk on Foot, Who, like a good Man, ne'er resented The Slight, but jog'd along contented; No Wonder, since we often find The Cuckold to his Maker kind, And humble Blockheads shew good Will To haughty Knaves that use 'em ill. No Mortal more expert than he In Cases of Mortality; For if a sick, consumptive Neighbour, Or pregnant Gossip near her Labour, Is swell'd so big she may be thought In Danger, when to Bed she's brought, When e'er they creep, or waddle by His Shop, he'as such a skilful Eye, That he can guess, or take their true Dimensions at one transient View; And make their Coffins at his Leisure, As well as if he'd taken Measure. So that when any Neighbour's dead, Their Coffin's always ready made, So firm, so strong, so very neat, That no defunct Possessor yet Could e'er complain they were unfit. Besides, it is by some allow'd, That he, by Art, can make one Shrowd Serve twenty Corps, by such a quick Conveyance, none can see the Trick, But, Jugler-like, can cheat the Eye Of e'ery watchful Stander by. Some Neighbours, merry o'er their Win Once form'd the following Design, In order to impose upon This Undertaking Parish-Don: The Plot was this: A Man was laid At length upon the Floor for dead, The rest most soberly disguis'd Their inward Mirth, and seem'd surpiz'd; Mean while, the archest of the Crew, Who well knew what to say, and do, Posted to Knick-knock in a Hurry, And told this lamentable Story: Lord! Mr. Church-Ward'n, what d'you think? 'Tis a sad Thing to die in Drink, But ? our Friend Fuddlecap, alas! Expir'd this Moment o'er the Glass, Stone dead at such a Tavern lies, To his Companions great Surprize; And when he sicken'd in his Chair, Had of his Soul so little Care, That falling thence upon the Boards, More Wine were his last dying Words. This said, he groan'd, and then, alas! Sneak'd slily off, and baulk'd his Glass. Pray therefore with a Coffin come, And help us to remove him home. Says Knick-knock, Since he lies so near, I'll step and take his Length, for fear My dull Remembrance of his Stature Should fail me in some trifling Matter. Accordingly they jogg'd together, To view the Corps and take right Measure, Both very wisely moralizing On Death so sudden, and surprizing; 'Till they had reach'd the Tavern, where These merry Wags had laid the Snare. Upstairs the Messenger advances, And after him Knick-knocky trances, Both gravely entering the Room, Where many Persons sat hum, drum, And by these solemn Toapers lay The dead Man, as a Man may say. The grave Church-Ward'n, in some Surprize, First lifting up his Hands, and Eyes, Struck with a sudden Inspiration, Flung out this short Ejaculation: Alas! What mortal Man is sure Of Life one transitory Hour! How oft have we together quaff'd, Told merry Stories, sip'd and laugh'd; But now, Dear Friend, thou'rt dead and gone, Thy Bottle's out, thy Glass is run; And I, that was some Years the elder, Am now become thy Coffin-Builder! Then stooping low with Hand and Head, To take true Measure of the Dead, The Corps reply'd, You lye, you Knave, I neither Coffin want, nor Grave. Then re-assuming all his Strength, And springing out his Leg at length, Gave Knocky such a mortal Thump Upon his Buttocks, near his Rump, That pitch'd him headlong on his Nose, So strenuous were the dead Man's Toes. Then those that had been thus contriving By shamming Death, to cheat the Living, At once turn'd all their seeming Sadness, To sudden Joy, next Kin to Madness, Whilst frighted Knick-knock run in Haste Down Tavern-Stairs, and left the rest To drink, and frolick o'er their Jest. Poor Knocky sneaking to another Tavern, there met a Vestry Brother, And other chosen Friends to treat, Charging whate'er they drank or eat, Good Wine, fat White-legs roast, and boil'd To one Dol. Gulpin, big with Child, A Faggot-Drab beneath their Care, That lives no mortal Man knows where Thus Ward'ns, like Captains, muster some Ne'er seen abroad, nor found at home; And keep in constant Pay, 'tis said, Others that have for Years been dead. Nor does this famous Coffin-maker, This over,âwell as Undertaker, Who first can kiss a pretty Maid To Death, and bury'r when she's dead, Prove kinder to the Sex in Want, When Age has made 'em Indigent, Than those Church-Ward'ns who ne'er had bin So guilty of the modish Sin; For if a poor old Parish-Dutchess, Applies for Alms upon her Crutches, Or fruitful Dame, o'erstock'd with Bearns, Who starve on what her Husband earns, Moves him with all due Condescension, To grant her a small weekly Pension; Perhaps, thro' his great Tenderness To such poor Wretches in Distress, Out of the Parish-Stock he grants Three Farthings, to relieve the Wants Of five or six, so very poor, The Children beg from Door to Door; And if they use one harsh Expression, Or mutter at the small Donation, By Aid of his robust Adherents, To th'Workhouse he commits the Parents Where they're confin'd, like Whore and Robb To hard unprofitable Labour: And if their Children are too little To be apply'd to Block and Beetle, He takes due Care to send 'em down To Enfield, or to Hartford Town, Where, in a little Time, in course, They're choak'd with Filth, or starv'd at Nurse. This, in his Ward'nship, has he done, By more poor Families than one. And when these Wretches on their due Submission to this Vestry-Jew, From their Confinement are enlarg'd, They are not totally discharg'd 'Till on their Knees, in open Street, They fall at Mr. Church-Ward'n's Feet, And for their Faults, before his Shop, Ask Pardon of this Parish-Pope. O shameful Insolence, and Pride, In Knaves that over Fools preside; Illit'rate, mercenary Swine, From Dunghils rais'd to Fowls and Wine; Brutes, that immoderately eat, And starve the very Poor they cheat; Gluttons, that in their Faces wear So dull, and porculent an Ayre, Especially, when rais'd aloft, By sensless Noise, and petty Craft, That their bluff Carriage, when they're drest For Sunday, or a Parish-Feast, Makes their Authority a Jest. The next that follows in his Turn, Is crusty G?, the Under-War'n; Who, by the W?mil o'er his Door, Discovers how he grinds the Poor; And by another in his Head, Grinds the whole Parish, as 'tis said; Brown G?e sometimes the People call him Because that Title does most gall him, Giv'n him by th'Poor, by whom he's curst For selling second Bread for first: Nor have the Pensioners the Freedom To buy their Loaves whene'er they need 'en Of any Baking-Hunx but G?ge, Whose Weight is seldom found too large; Therefore the Parish-Poor are paid, Not in hard Money, but coarse Bread. The Head Church-War'n he Tickets gives 'em To the Low'r Warden, who deceives 'em. And thus the Poor, to most Mens Wonder, Betwixt the Upper Crust, and Under, Are choak'd with Bread, as many think, For Want of Pence to purchase Drink: Whilst Madam, once the Baker's Maid, Whose Foot long since was brought to Bed, Adorn'd with massy Golden Chain, Grows wondrous lofty, proud, and vain; And, in his Absence, treats her Daughters, With Coffee, Tea, and Cordial Waters. Thus cunning Knaves that rob the Spittle, Maintain the Bottle, and Tea-Kettle, By coz'ning e'ery one a little. The next wise Ruler is a Meal-Man, Neither a good Man, nor an ill Man; But one that may be said to stand 'Twixt both, and lean on neither Hand; A Common-Council-Man, whose Tongue Is with such odious Language hung, That in his cross ill-natur'd Freaks, You'd think he rather Growls than Speaks; Each Sentence tags with Hah! or Hoh! As ramming Paviours do each Blow; From whence his Neighbours, to perplex him, Call him 'Squire Hoh, and then they vex him; Whose surly Nature may be seen In his grim Looks, and hoggish Mein, And his high Station easily read In the stern Motions of his Head. As Kings, and Judges may be known, By solemn Nods on Bench, or Throne. Money he hugs like any Miser, And thinks his Riches make him wiser, Does therefore in his Hands with-hold A five Years Debt of Orphans Gold; And, in Conjunction with his Brethren, Has sunk the Tax they've long been gathering, Humbly conceiving that to cheat The Cheaters, is no Fraud, but Wit. Yet, when he rides to Hartford-Heath, To ease his Lungs, and gain new Breath, No Man can be of Tongue more lavish, In blaming those that serve the Parish, Than he, who ne'er oblig'd his Friend, Or Neighbour, but for some bye End. As borrow'd Sums are often lent, By Knaves, to Fools, at Cent. per Cent. The promising fat Babe of Grace, Next lamely hobbles to his Place, As if the painful Gout had seiz'd him, Or that the Crinkums had diseas'd him: However, tho' he seems too young To be with Parish Honours hung; Yet from his Spices, and his Plumbs, He creeping to the Vestry comes, There looks as big, and talks more bold Than any Coxcomb twice as old; Altho' his Brains are full as bare Of Wisdom, as his Chin of Hair. But Parish-Offices, we know, Like Kissing, do by Favour go; Or, like Court Places, often fall To those whose Merits are but small. Nor can this spicy Mortal vaunt He'as been a long Inhabitant, Or from his Standing claim a Seat At Vestry-Board, among the Great; Because much wiser Men than he, And fitter for Authoritie, Grave old Parishioners, have been Postpon'd to bring this Whiffler in. Some Neighbours scruple not to tell ye, The Vestry chose him by his Belly; For his huge pamper'd Quag of Guts, Betray the Glutton, as he struts, And to the gazing World discover He's a true Gutt'ler, and a Lover Of any Parish-Trust, or Post, Where Men turn Swine at others Cost. In this fat Pasture let him feast His Guts, till grown a perfect Beast; And that his Body may be fed, 'Till equal to his Joulter-Head; Then might the Parish boast a large, Fat Monster bred at her own Charge. A Land-Tax-Gath'rer next appears, Imploy'd full Five and Twenty Years, Who by his Poundage, without wronging, And Perquisites thereto belonging, Makes it a sweeter Trade, with Care, Than selling Sugars to the Fair: His Tongue, altho' a Little Mortal, Is louder than a double-Curtel, And can excel th'expertest Dames, At Billingsgate, in calling Names. From Offices can save his Friends, When 'tis to serve his own bye-Ends, And slily can the same impose On others, whom he deems his Foes. Thus, like the Satyr fam'd of old, Blows, as he pleases, Hot, or Cold. The Vestry Silk-Worm, next in Turn, Advances, full of Pride and Scorn, Who, Hedge-Hog like, 'tis too well known Rowls himself up in his own Down, And unto the whole World beside Turns nothing but his prickly Hide, Loves no Man but himself alone, And is himself belov'd of none: Was never match'd in Carriage stately, But by his Man, and that but lately, Who, mimicking his Master's great Example, walks, and struts in State. âBut if the Man such Praise must have, âThen what must he that taught the Knave, Nor does his Master walk without A Pistol, which he wears to shoot Any vain Upstart that discovers More Pride than he exerts to others; Yet no Man need to have a Care, For all are safe but Lucifer. Count Tallard next appears among This Gormandizing, Vestry Throng Who smells as strong of Cheese and Bacon, As an old Trap where Mice are taken; Is also, if Report be true, Famous for Lies, and Swearing too; And tho' he'as been advanc'd of late To sit among the Fools in State, He's not too Stiff, or Proud to stoop To any forward Dam'sel's Hoop, But, Bona fide A Bye-Word he uses,, understands The Art of Groping with his Hands, As well as any Bawdy Jade, That has Five hundred Women laid. A Calliconian next appears, That deals in fine stain'd Cotton Wares; Such as our Buxom Ladies buy, To tempt, or charm, an am'rous Eye. Some Time ago no Man could be A greater Enemy than he, To Select Vestries, and their Banquets, And all Parochial costly Junkets, 'Till he was call'd to take a Post Among the rest that rule the Roast; And ever since he swears the Clan Are truly honest to a Man. (So the desirous Lass, before She's naught herself condemns the Whore, But when corrupted, and made common, She swears a Whore's an honest Woman.) Since chosen into this high Place, Good Claret much improves his Face, And makes his blushing Rubies shine So bright, when flush'd with Parish Wine, That in the darkest Nights that come, He needs no Boy to light him Home. Three honest Men among the rest Appear; and that you'll say's a Jest; The First is sorward to reveal Those Frauds the Vestry would conceal, And, loving Justice, never joins His Brethren in their base Designs, Will take no Share of Parish Plunder, But uses Conscience,âthat's a Wonder! Abhorring ev'ry ill Device, Bearing no Spleen, or Prejudice To any but to Rats, and Mice. The Second is a Man so just, His Motto is, Weave Truth with Trust. No costly Dainties can incline His squeamish Appetite to Dine, Or Sup, and swill down what the Poor Have much more Title to devour, But oft proposes, tho' in vain, To e'ery Gutt'ling Vestry-Man, That when they meet to glut, and for, Each pamper'd Swine should pay his Shot, And for the future never gorge, Their Bellies at the Parish Charge. But good Advice is thrown away, The Kites will still be Birds of Prey. The Third and last, but lately chosen A Vestry Counsellor, and Cousin, Thinking himself too young to be Advanc'd to such Authority, When some that had a prior Claim, Were thought unworthy of the same; And finding that the Parish paid For e'ery lavish Feast they made, Deserted all the Gutt'ling-Crew, And from the Vestry-Board withdrew. Rejecting, with Contempt, and Scorn, Their fair Entreaties to return; And does to publick Knowledge bring Their secret Ways of Managing. So be that's honest, and, by Chance, Falls among Knaves, thro' Ignorance, Will give their Frauds no Approbation, But wisely quit their Conversation. These latter conscientious Three Are from the Lash of Satyr free; But those that take the Rule upon 'em, O'th' Parish, till they've half undone 'em, From Satyr must expect no more Kind Usage than they give the Poor: Such selfish, surly, greedy Sots, Whose craving Guts, and thirsty Throats Swallow one half of what's collected To ease the Wants of the Dejected. These are the Vestry that expends Ten Pounds a Time, to treat their Friends, Yet grumble to divide in Bread, A Tythe 'mong Families decay'd. These are the Miscreants that draw The Parish into Suits of Law; And such, as by their strange surpizing Mismanagements, and Gomandizing, Have brought the Parish Stock of late, At least Two Thousand Pounds in Debt: And when they pass their vile Accounts, Shut out the best Inhabitants, Because their Frauds so naked are, Their Books will no Inspection bear. Yet some of these are call'd upon The Court of Conscience, tho' they've none Where their grave Wisdoms sit to do That Justice which they never knew. These are the Sots, that when they treat Themselves, swear, e'ery time they meet, To hear, and see, but nothing say; To eat, and drink, but nothing Pay. Should all their num'rous Faults be told, No Volume would their Knav'ries hold. But this small Version, tho' 'twas wrote By Fits, and Starts, with little Thought, Shews what each Parish must expect, From Guttl'ing Vestries call'd SELECT. FINIS.</field>
