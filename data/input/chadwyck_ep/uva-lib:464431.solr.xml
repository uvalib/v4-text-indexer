      <field name="fulltext">CARMEN-TERNARIUM SEMI-CYNICUM. A DOS, of RIME and REASON: Presented by Major Geo, Wither, to some of his noble Friends, Members of the most honourable House of Commons. 1 Friends, by your leave; and, in a Cynick-time, If I present you with a Doggrell-Rime, Impute it not, I pray you, as a crime: For, whatsoe're occasion her excites, My Muse weighs what, and unto whom she writes; And, though she grumbles, neither snarles, nor bites. 2 'Tis now, a Pentecost, and six weeks more, Since I was last a Suitor at your doore; For, 'twas your Christmasse Eves-Eve heretofore: Yea, 'twas the Morne that next ensu'd the day, Wherein you did convene to fast, and pray, That, what you now are planting, prosper may. 3 God grant your Suits may better thrive then mine; God give you of your hopes a better signe; And, more to you, then you to me incline: For, if much longer, I be now delay'd, My just Demands, to me had best been pay'd, If, at the first, they had been quite denay'd. 4 This, is (in print and writing) since th'Edition Of that, which first made knowne my sad condition, At least the twice ten hundreth Repetition; Yet, most Complaints, that I have tendered, Seem; as if neither heeded, heard, nor read, And, take effect, like Prayers to the Dead. 5 This, is above the six and thirti'th yeare, Since first, my Muses flung defiance, here, Against their waies, who now your foes appeare; Yet, they who slight your Cause, have better far'd; They, who destroy you, have had more regard, And, oft you heare them, when I am unheard. 6 This, is the nineth or tenth new-minted-way, By which, I've took occasion to assay, How, I might find acceptance, when I pray; Yet, nor choise Times, nor Seasons, Rimes nor Prose, Service to you, hot Suffrings, by your foes, Produce ought hitherto, but empty-showes. 7 This, is the seventh year, since I begun To suffer with you, and to be undone, For, being, to your Cause, a Faithfull-one; Yet, have my Foes prevailed, by their Charmes, To make my faithfulnesse increase my harms, And, crush'd me, nigh to death, ev'n in your Armes. 8 This, is the third moneth, since a hopefull signe, Made shew, as if you joyntly did incline To be aspitious to such plaints at mine: Yet, still, crosse accidents make vold my suit, With my estate, destroying my repute, And, I get nought, but blossoms without fruit. 9 Two twelve moneths since, and twice within that space, Your House, hath in compassion of my case, Referr'd the naming of me to some Place, That, till the Publike shall repay my debt, I, by my labours, might subsistence get; But, no effect thereof, appeareth, yet. 10 A place was once propos'd, for which, to cleare My debt, I offer made: But, one sate there, Who, whilst I beat the bush, did catch the Hare. Another, I was nam'd to; but, ere I Could get the same reported, they, who trie The surest course, found means to put me by. 11 To twenty other places, I of late Was nam'd, wherein, I might have serv'd the State, If, I, like other men, had Friends or Fate: But, they that have enough, must, yet, have more; They, who are needy, must be still kept poore, And, he gets most, that had too much before. 12 Nor would I grudge, might I my own receive, To misse the best preferments you could give; For, I can find my self work whilst I live: And, should be better pleased to possesse My self, in an obscured quietnesse, Then, in the greatest of your Offices. 13 And, peradventure, better thrive should I, If, I could still beleeve, undoubtingly, That, in this world, my portion doth not lie: For, whatsoever promise she doth make, Or, whatsoever likely course I take, I, either nothing win, or lose my stake. 14 Yea, whosoever are put out or in; Whether you feast, or fast, or lose, or win, My portion, to this day, the same hath been: And, neither Orders, Votes, nor Ordinances, Nor ought else, hitherto, my cause advances; But, multiplies, cost, troubles, and mischances. 15 They, who heed this; and, mark how long I sue For that, which you your selves acknowledge due, Suppose my Friends unkind, or, very few: And, so shall I think too; if, when I see The grand-affairs dispens'd withall may bee, You, more consider not, my wants and mee. 16 For, though the Publike cause should be preferr'd, Some houres, for private causes, must be spar'd, Lest, none be left, the Publike to regard. Your publike actings too, (as I conceive) Would better thrive, did you more oft relieve Their suffrings, whom, your long demurrers grieve. 17 Three moneths (at full) you have delay'd to heare All private pressures, how extreme soe're; Yea, though your faithfull friends the Suitors were: Yet, you could, then, allow spare time for those, Who were your wilfull and condemned Foes: And, grace you did vouchsafe, to some of those. 18 To none I grudg your mercy: yet, withall I wish, that you to mind would likewise call, How, to your friends, worse things then Death befall: For, Penitents condemned, can but die: Which, were it in my power, disdain would I, To ask, what any mortall could deny. 19 To see our selves, with many mischiefs hemn'd, Pursu'd by Foes, and of our Friends contemn'd, Is worse, then guiltlesly to be condemn'd. Yea, to behold their Families undone, Who, for the publike, did that hazzard run, Deserves more pity, then a dying-grone. 20 Although the Publike Wants, be very great, The Publike-Justice, it doth ill be fit That, some, large-Favour find; some, never a whit: That, some, should likewise have immediate pay; Some, interest at full, for all delay; Some others, nothing, after six years stay. 21 That he, to whom the State doth nothing owe, Should rich, by three or foure employments grow, Whilst they pine, who, thereon did all bestow: And, that those who have spent more pretious time, To serve you, then the whole earth can redeem, Should scarce find one half-houre, befriending them. 22 Consider, I beseech you, how ye may (Before all Opportunities are slipt away) Preserve their being, who assist you may; And, let them not be needlessely destroyd, By whom, your safety, may be best enjoyd; And, with whose hopes, yours, also, will be voyd. 23 Nor think your selves excus'd, if you deny To yeeld me at my need, a due supply; Because, five hundred want as much as I: For, no good Principle, they build upon Who shall resolve, they will be kind to none, Because, they cannot succour ev'ry one. 24 We who are Standers-by, do plainly see, That, if self-seekers might removed bee, (Or, would in just, and righteous things agree) Both Means, and Time enough might, yet, be found, To make the sick Republike, quickly sound, And, ease the smart of ev'ry private wound. 25 Yea, we perceive, that if division were Well made, of what the common purse may spare; (Of places, which at your disposure are) And, of your time and paines; you might have eas'd Your selves much more; your best friends, more have pleas'd, And, kept off troubles, which on us have seiz'd. 26 New States and Governments, best founded are By Justice, and by Mercy; and, to spare A Largesse too, it now convenient were: At least, we may expect, as well as you, Subsistence out of that which is our due, To keep us able, who were alwaies true, 27 For, what will it availe you, when your friends, Who, might be serviceable to your ends, Want means to further what the State intends? Or, with what courage, can those men go on, To help you, in that work which is begun, If, they must perish, e're it shall be done? 28 What can they hope for, when their Foe shall raign, Who, whilst their Friends rule, sue seven years, in vaine, (Not Favors) but, bare Justice to obtain? Yet, get nought visible, wherewith to cherish Their children (which through want are like to perish) Except perchance a Pension from their Parish. 29 My case is not so bad: But, if you thought How neere thereto, I'me drove; how low I'me brought, And, what hard lessons I am daily taught, You would excuse this discomposed-strain, Believe my head broke, e're you saw my brain; And, let me sue, and wait, no more in vain. 30 For, if extremities compell me should To summe up all, which I in scraps have told, (And justly might have added, if I would) They, who observe the love to me pretended, How known I am, and yet how ill befriended, Would quite despair, to see their troubles ended. 31 Fair promises, prove neither flesh nor fish; My gaines are, hitherto, not worth a rush; But that befalls me, which my Foes do wish. For, when to do me right, fit time there was, Some friends lackt power; some, were not then in place; And, some, that had the power, had not the grace. 32 Your Ordinance, the Lords concurrence lackt, And, my estate, and credit, will be crackt, Unlesse, with speed, you turn it to an Act: Few minutes may compleat it, which I pray Vouchsafe; For, by the late three moneths delay, I, six moneths interest, am like to pay. 33 Bis, dat, qui citò dat, the Proverb saies; And, 'tis as true, that, he, who long delaies A Favour or a Gift, nought gives, or paies. For, by delay, thus fareth it with most, That, by vexation, labour, time, and cost, The profits of slow Benefits, are lost. 34 But, I, this Theam, have long enough persude: Lest, therefore, it may tire you (to obtrude Much more upon your patience) Ile conclude: Yea, for a few daies, here Ile make a stop; And, if I then, accomplish not my hope, Ile play but one Card more; and, so, give up. 35 As much for others sakes, as for mine own This sense, of private suffrings, I have shown: And hope, it will with good effects be known, For, when I mind what work you have to do, And, how few, put their helping hands thereto, I can excuse you; and, have oft doue so.
