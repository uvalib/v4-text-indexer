      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS. ROBERT ARKWRIGHT, AS A SLIGHT TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FOR HER UNRIVALLED TALENTS, AND AS A TRIFLING TOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LINES WRITTEN AT NAPLES. Ye clear waves, with your murmuring, murmuring flow, Whence do you comeâand whither do ye go? You seem in gentle haste, as though to escape Some fast pursuer, which my thoughts can shape Fantastically and grotesquely now Into some Sea-God, with his furrowed browâ Into some rough old Sea-God's rugged form, Chief of the tides, and ruler of the stormâ Lord of the depths, and master of the wave, Liege of the rock, and monarch of the cave! Who, shaking back the deep locks from his face, Drives the light dancing waves with idle chace; Or, we might dream you onwards, onwards come To seek the shore as Exiles would their homeâ But like a keen fond hope, whose darling aim Is ever missedâye, vainly, wander tame Like shepherdless flocks, although in sooth ye reach That which appears your goalâthe shell-strewn beach; But when ye reach itâstill do ye recoil And but repeat your taskârenew your toil As though by disappointment faintly crossed, And while your end was gained, yourselves were lost. So in confusion sweet, ye seem to track Your own light watery footsteps softly back. Bear with yeâOh! ye wanderersâbear my thoughts, Mournful and faint, as Echo's dying notes!â But bear them with ye wheresoe'er ye go, So that no more unto myself they flow! Whither they may escape I little careâ To lose themâto forget themâis my pray'r, For heavy are they, sad and full of gloom, And make this Earth a universal tomb! Oh! could erazure be serenely made Of their dull traceriesâpainfully displayed Along this altered aspectâthat no more May wear that lightsome look which once it wore, Then might I hail the glory and the grace That lives on Nature's ever-changing face, Nor feel my hopeless, restless self the while Almost a blot upon her beam-bright smileâ A dull deep silence in that song of praise Which she doth ever in her gladness raiseâ Lone in her populous and stirring scenes, Whence the sick heart but dubious solace gleans; Dead in her lifeâand dark within her light, A spot upon her garments sheen and white, A drop of gall in her deep cup of blissâ And could it be I was reserved for this? Be still, vain thoughts; let soul, and ear, and eye, Drink in this slumberous monotony, This quiet of the Oceanâhushed and calm, That through the Existence sheds a blessed balmâ Aye! even despite of many griefs, through mine, And I will rouse me now and not repine. Yet could ye, could ye, little wandering waves, O'er whose light wreaths no rough'ning storm-gust raves, Could you but take my keen thoughts for your guests, And lull them as in ever-rocking nests, 'Mid your blue ripples, and soft rufflings mild, Till they, that were like vultures fierce and wild, As calm and still as halcyons even might grow, Forgetful of their fond and feverish woe; Or could you but far hence those vain thoughts bear, Oh! could ye waft them swiftlyâany where! E'en to the Horizon's aÃ«ry harbour dim, Where fails the eye to mark its shadowy rimâ Or to the Ocean's wide and wond'rous waste, Where Sea and Sky together seem embracedâ I care not where they may their dwelling find, So they are banished from my weary mind! The hour's enchantingâthe transcendent sky Is blue as Homer imaged Pallas' eye; Blueâblue, and bright even painfully! I turn My dazzled eyes away, that throb and burn, Fatigued by BeautyâBeauty ev'n will tire Eyes that have quenched in tears their pristine fire. I sit me down beside this lovely Sea, Fain to partake its pure tranquillity; How fair it is, how calm and smooth it lies, As 'twould not break the image of the Skies, So brightly painted on its polished breast, In all the placid loveliness of rest! How fair it is!âhow gently should those wild, Those fierce concussions of jarred thought sink mild Before such happy influences as here With tenderest power and soft prevailings dear Come consentaneously upon the Soul!â Still warblingâshining on, and warbling roll Ye waves of beauty then, and wile away The ills that cloud my spirit night and day, Till those sad visitors, dark Grief and Pain, (Wont, if we once receive them, to remain) And sick Depression with its half formed tear! And vain and passionate Regretâpale Fearâ And paler far Suspenseâlie down and sleep, And Memory, hushed and lulled, forgets to weep! Oh! could we keep our Spirits pure and fair, That Heaven might be serenely mirror'd there As now upon this glad and glassy tide Stamped with its face, with its complexion dyed, Nor break its blessed Image in our Soul, Where Pride's stern billows dark and threat'ning roll, Where Passion's stormy rufflings troublous spread, And terrors dire awake, and tumults dreadâ Then were we happyâthen most truly blestâ Then were our lot Earth's brightest and Earth's best. But mark how few do thusâAlas! how few, Though all believe 'tis Peace that they pursue The while anxieties of every kind They seek to plant within the unquiet mind, And rashly court to their own bitter grief Those ills from which they most should pray relief, Till all their Being's fountains, which should be Preserved in clear transparent purity, Are clouded o'er, disturbed, and dimmed, and stained, And no fair trace of Heaven is there retained! Wrapped round with gloom and darkness as a vest, With vile or troublous images impressed, How are the Soul's unfathomable deeps Lost to the peace the very Ocean reaps From time to timeâwhen winds forget to blow, And the Elements their hour of stillness know. Beautifulâbeautifulâthe purple floor Of Ocean is, as 'twere strewed brightly o'er With gems of old monarchic pomp; 'tis lit As if by melting starsâI pondering sitâ And let the Beauty that around me glows Sink through my gladdened spiritâfrom the rose These hours seem coloured, and too clear and bright Are they to be insulted in their flight, (Around them scattering visions of delight) By Sorrow's trembling accents and her tears, By Care's vain bodements and uneasy fears? No! we should chase our sorrows, and aside Should cast our inner weight, and closely hide Our cares within their secret, silent nest, At Nature's feast to move a fitting guest; Where all appear to triumph and rejoice, Shall we uplift a harsh discordant voice? Where all are smiling, shall we coldly frown, And dash the cup of proffered gladness down, And spurn the flowers presented by her hand, With kind allurement and persuasion bland? To throw the ashes of despair instead Upon the heavy and dejected head! And come into her glorious presence, drest As in a sombre and a mourning vest, As though to insult her with a proud neglect, And brave her with a pomp of disrespect! Paven with myriad Golden Lightnings keen Art thouâblue, bluest Mediterranean, seen! On this sweet day of sunlight, what a wealth Of splendours, without stain, or stint, or stealth, Hast thou accumulated hereâbright Sea! Challenging Earth with sweet rivality, Earth, that might tremble at the match despite Her ever-beauteous fixtures of Delight! Despite the wond'rous glory, and the pride Of her rich treasures scattered free and wide, Her violet-covered banks and sunny glades, Her verdurous pastures and her bowery shades, Her broad savannahs and her boundless woods, And soaring mountains capped with snow-white hoods. Yes! still despite of these, of all, bright Sea, Thou bravely battlest for supremacyâ Thou that art varying ever thine array, And altering thy fine aspect night and day; Thouâwhom no swiftly-passing minute leaves Unto the next unchanged, since ever heaves In ceaseless motion thy fair glittering breast, Restlessâyet in a rapture of deep rest! For ofttimes dost thou in thy strife ev'n seem Like one who lightly stirs him in his dreamâ Who feels the blessedness of Slumber's balm, And feeds upon the consciousness of calm! While every vein with soft enjoyment glows, And every pulse is telling of repose, Each breath is blissâeach sense is sooth'd with sleep, And heavenly languors through the lulled frame creep! So dost thou seem at times even in thy strife, As but luxuriating in glowing life. And though thou'rt changingâchanging evermore, Thy bright inconstancy we still adore; And even between thy most discrepant moods There are bless'd links and sweet similitudes; Or when thou'rt ploughed by sudden rising gale, Or when smooth summer clouds above thee sailâ Fair decked with all the beauty of the stars, Or warring midst the Elements wild wars, Or brightened by the Rainbow's coloured sheen, When peace presides o'er all the pleasant scene, Or blazoned by the Lightning's bickering flame, Ever art thou Another and the Same! All golden, golden melodies that dream Or sense can compass here commingling seem To crave attention with persuasion such As Hope might use to soften and to touch A heart that had perceived her dangerous power, And shrunk from her delirious rapturous shower Of quick emotions and enchanted dreamsâ For still with these her magic empire teems! Oh! let this soft and odorous-breathing air Make sweet erazure of the lines of care Drawn o'er this aching forehead, and no more Let hoarded fears and doubtsâa gloomy store Crush down the heart, which doth their freight contain, That vainly tries to battle with its pain! And let not now uneasy thoughts distract The mind, too long by their harsh discord racked; Nor fatal Reminiscences destroy The Soul's new Quiet ripening into Joy, Though imperceptibly, mid this bright scene Of splendour, where high Nature is the Queen! This wide and wonderous and eternal court, Where those who own her Sovereign Power resort. Yes! blow, kind winds! and make erazure sweet Of Grief's dull characters, and gently cheat These languid lips into a lingering smile, Though the stern Mistress harshly shall revile And roughly shall endeavour to retain Her shaken empire of puissant Pain! In pity, gentle winds, prevailing blow With all the grateful freshness ye bestow, With all your soft small harmonies, and wealth Of odours and delightsâand so by stealth Shall ye now win me from myself!âAlas! The happiest fortune that can come to pass For me, in these my melancholy years, To Grief's dark truths devoted, and to tears; For Fancy and gay Hope, and all their dreams, So bright, so glad, so lit by Heaven-caught beams, Have long deserted one whom ruthless Fate Hath bowed to Earth with Sorrow's leaden weight. Yes!âwin me from myself!âfor me were this The best of benefitsâthe brightest bliss, The most victorious and the proudest feat That could be compassed, since doth ever beat With all too much of trouble and distrust My weary heartâunto itself unjust, And almostâif, indeed, it so could beâ Unjust unto this world of misery!â For ever and anon even here we find Fair shows, and sunny scenes, and natures kindâ Nay, bright realitiesânot harshânot stern, But these to meetâah! whither shall I turn? For Life's realities to me seem still All that is gloomyâbitterâhard and chill. And ever doth my stubborn heart refuse All comfort, save the indulgence which it wooes In its own desolate and dreary griefâ From which it seeks not, nor expects relief; But win this weak heart from itself at last, And wean it from all memory of the Past, And wrest away each form stamped there before, And wring regret's black drop from out its core. Aye! win me from myselfâthe dearest boon That may be given, is sweet Oblivion, To marked and mourning Spirits, that essay Vainly to battle with the opposing clay That clogs, and curbs, and checks them every way. Nature! thou soothest thy children best in truth, Nay! it is thou alone who knowest to soothe; Thou only who canst medicine the o'er-wrought mind, And minister to morbid thoughts enshrined Deep in the bosom's hushed and haunted cell, Where vain regrets and mournful fancies dwell O'er the heart's woundsâthe spirit's achings sore, And the brain's tempest-throbbingsâthou canst pour A soothing and a most sufficient balm, And bless us with a bright and breathing calm. The o'erwhelming Passion-hurricanes that shake The Spirit to its centre, when they wake In all the deadly outburst of their power, In the full sweep of their prevailing hour, Thou canst, with silent and with 'suasive skill, Chain down to peaceâand soften and make still. And thou, too, canst uplift the fardels cold, That crush the very Soul's soul, and enfold In healing bands, that fevered, wildered brain, That makes a dim Religion of its Pain! Bright glowing Italy! thou want'st a charm Unto my yearning heartâwhich can disarm Thine aspect of its dazzling pomp and might, Its glory, and its witchery, and its light, By calling from its depths those treasured forms, How well preserved 'mid all Life's fearful storms. The forms it worshipped in the days of old, When it and they seemed cast in one bright mould, One mould celestialâperfect and supremeâ And this was but the mockery of a dream! But yet this mockery of a dream outweighs All that shines forth in Beauty's proudest blaze, And challengeth Reality to show Aught that may match with its display below. The forms, the scenes beloved in th' earlier times, Still haunt us through all changes and all climes. Yes, Italy! for me thou want'st one charm, To entrammel, and to enrapture, and to warm, The charm of the Old Associations dear, Which bid us most our Father Land revere, Where in glad childhood's cloudless faith we moved, And saw and worshipped, and believed and loved; Where, in the light of lovely thoughts, we walked, And dwelt with visions, and with Angels talked, Uncurbed in Fancy, as unchecked by Fear, And Earth was as a fair seraphic sphere! And, therefore, while I gaze and muse apart, That true magician, the all skilful heart, Can strip thee of thy dazzling glory's might, And bid a shadow fall upon thy light, And cloud thy splendour's overpowering pride, And half thy loveliness obscure and hide; And yet thou art most lovely and most fair, And glorious is thy sky, thine earth, thine air; There is a witchery in thy wildest scene, And still thou seem'st Heaven's Bride and Earth's crown'd Queen. How doth that Heaven with its own precious hues Thy lovely aspect radiantly suffuse, And seal thy forehead with its living Sun, As a bright symbol that thou'rt wooed and won; So dost thou seem its gorgeous Bride to stand Forth singled, Beauteous Oneâfrom every land. For where else doth the eternal boundless sky Shine down with such o'erpowering majesty? As when of old the dread Olympian Jove Sought, passion-swayed, to win his Danae's love, And in his proudest splendours shone arrayed, His glorious blaze revealed, his light displayed, When in his full celestial state he came, And put on all the God, her soul to inflame; So Heaven appears, with all its radiant powers, To greet thee with a stream of golden showers; A myriad and a myriad dyes and beams Still flash upon thy woods, and hills, and streams. Scarce, as we look upon the dazzling scene, In all its glorying glow and sparkling sheen, Can we distinguish clearly land from sky, All seems commixed in boundless majesty; One universal outstretched Heaven appears, To charm us wheresoe'er we look, and rears Triumphant Beauty here, an eye that drinks our tears! And yet I err, for though I sit beside Blue-rolling seas, upon whose glassy tide All glories shine retraced, of Heaven and Earth, Which they bring forth in yet diviner birthâ Upon a shore as fair as river-banks, Where brightly bloom, in starred and rainbowed ranks, The dewy children of the golden hours, The lovely marvels of resplendent flowers. Cannot dejected Memory fairer show, Recalling days of old, when with the glow Of Summer, and the royal, royal Rose Mingled the glow of Hope, whose brightness throws All else into the shadeâand whose decay Steals all its fairest radiance from the day. On light-swift pinions, Hope, sweet traitress! flies, And half the etherial beauty of the Skies, And glory of the Sun, away it bears, And Earth thenceforward a changed aspect wearsâ Aye! the third part of Heaven's rare splendours seem To share its wane, and wither beam by beam! As when, of old, the Serpent drew away A third part of Heaven's lights to dark decay. Now cares incessant trouble my repose, And dim despondencies and pallid woes, And sickening fears, do ofttimes darkly steal Delight awayâforbidding still to feel That loveliness which to behold must be Inevitableâwhen we dwell with thee, Maternal Nature! in a land like this, With beauty overflowing and with bliss! But doubts and woes, despondencies and fears, And care's vile troublings, and regret's vain tears, Shall all give way to thee ev'n now, awhile, Sweet Memory! with thy pensive song and smile. Yes! thou shalt gently every thought enchain, And come with thousand shadows for thy train! Now shalt thou make my heart's dulled pulses thrill! Days of my fair and fairy Childhood, fill With rapturous reminiscences my Soulâ Days, when my Heart was not a living Coal, My Brain was not a razed and withered Scroll, My Life was not a tempestâand a toil, My Thought was not a wrung and ravelled coil, My Soul was not a sun-scorched wildernessâ My Being not a burthen of Distress. Old Days! come back upon my Spirit now, Flush the re-kindling cheek and smoothe the brow, And thence unnumbered dark revealings chase, And softer, tenderer meanings lightly trace; With pleasurable tears mine eyes shall fill, My pulse confess a pleasurable thrill, And full of gentle strength, and trust, and joy, (The dearer for long seasons of annoy,) Shall sweet Sensations bless my heart once more, And Life and gladness for awhile restore! Those sweet sensations, neither cold nor dull, But quick and fine, and fresh and beautiful, That take on this material Earth no name, But whisper to the Spirit whence they came! Vague, strange, and indistinct, in truth they are, And with our mortal Natures seem at war. But oh! that precious indistinctness even Makes them more mind us of our distant Heaven. They are not wholly joy, nor wholly fear, Not wholly clouded, and not wholly clearâ Not wholly pleasure, and not wholly pain, But of all these partaking, they enchain, With countless links, the Soul o'er which they reign. England! I still must turn to theeâto thee, When I would walk the World of Memory! When I would 'midst its bowers of Beauty stray, And bask in its sweet dream-light, where each ray Is precious, consecrated, mystic, clear, Though trembling as the gleams from some far sphere, A sunny smileâand a transparent tear Together mingling there, together metâ Form that loved lightâwhich flows from Suns long set. England!âthine air, thy sky, thy well-known ground, For me with recollections blest, abound; And fates and feelings ne'er to be forgot, Are linked with many a scene and many a spot In thy maternal bosom, pure and fair, Which blights shall never blotânor tempests tear. Heaven's favoured and Earth's honoured land art thou, And mayst thou ever be as thou art now. Everâoh! best of tests!âmayst thou thus prove As hallowed by thy children's yearning love. England, thou mayst not boast of skies so blue As here are bent in lustre ever new, In splendour ever fresh and ever pure, Above our heads, to enchant and to allure. But Native Landâmy own bright Land beloved, At whose dear mention all my soul is moved, How true it is that Love's transpiercing eyes See Heaven far clearer through familiar skies! A mystery of sweet consciousness is thereâ They seem more open to our gaze and prayer, And less estranged from the encircled earth, When thus we view them from our place of birth. Love! Love! what is there that thou canst not do, Thou only perfect, only bright and true? Thou canst make Earth as holy as a shrineâ In its own self, as 'twere almost divine! And even make Heaven more heavenly through thy Power, In the sweet strength of thine enchanted hour! All things beneath thy touch become more fair, And the deep hues of thy own Beauty wear; All Nature craves from thee a costly gift, Or ere she can the expanding heart uplift, And light with fervent admiration's flameâ Yea! still she calls for aid upon thy name, Since all without thee is but cold and tame. Thou, even thou, immortal Power! canst lend Beauty sublime and Glory without end To things least lovelyâthink, oh! think but then What charms must Love impart to that which men Look on with swelling hearts and raptured eyes, Though unendeared by fond and fast-bound ties, Affections and associations old, And wonted habits closely-clinging fold, Even such a scene as this, now brightly spread Around me, who on ground enchanted tread, And breathe an air itself a Paradise, And gaze on glorious and magnific skies, And scent a thousand odorous balmy gales, That tell of fragrant haunts, delicious tales; For now the orange-flower in bowered retreats Is budding forthâa treasury of rich sweets, And sheds its perfumed tidings far around, Till the Ocean's deep pulsations ev'n seem bound In rapture and voluptuous glad amaze, While winds a thousand and a thousand ways The enthralling fragrance passing richly o'er The terraced slopes, the palaced streetsâthe shoreâ And floating o'er the bosom of the bay, As there alone it were content to stay. Then thinkâOh! think but then what charms supreme Must Love impart to every mount and stream, To every fountain and to every flower, To every 'broidered bank and every bower, In such a Land as thisâa fairy Land, Where Nature smiles for ever bright and bland. But yet, in sooth, I cannot envy those Who claim this Land of Rainbow and the Rose; Something there is more dear and holy yet Than dazzling suns in pomp that rise and set, And make Creation like one Glory round Their burning throne, whose splendour hath no boundâ Than flashing skies, that scarce seem to require That Sun to illume their depths of azure fire! Than waves of beauty, and than woods of balm, And glowing hours of dream, and light, and calmâ Than groves like those Hesperian gardens old That flamed with ever-clustering fruits of goldâ Than deep dyed flowers, and perfume-breathing trees, And singing fountain, and soft genial breeze. Something more dear and sacred far than these There surely is, howe'er they may inspire And light the spirit with poetic fireâ The inviolate altar, and the hallowed hearth, The free fair homeâthat dearest spot of Earth, The unsullied and the consecrated sod, By step of slave or foeman yet untrodâ The privileges pure, the established rights, The sacred bond, which still all hearts unitesâ The happy household blessings shared by all, The glorious freedom that ne'er knew a thrallâ The firm yet tolerant faithâthe enlightened viewsâ The unbroken peace that wears Heaven's own deep hues: These things beyond a doubt are nobly worth All the outward-glittering pomps of Heaven and Earth. And where may these so certainly be found As, England, on thy fair and favoured ground? Therefore it is, I little envy those Who claim these skies of gold, this land of rose, These airs of incense, and these waves of light, That thrill the senses, and that thrall the sight; Therefore it is, that while I wondering gaze On all this pride and show, and pomp and blaze, My thoughts, like passage birds, fly back to thee, My own dear country o'er the deep blue sea. What though ten thousand and ten thousand things Charm and enchant them hereâthey keep their wings! Those wings that bear them homeward evermore From this delicious but divided shore; Those wings that ever waft them back to thee, My Land! the dear, the happy, and the free! To thee and to mine own delightful home In thy calm bosom, and while still I roam More steadfastly transfixed my thoughts become In love to thee, my Englandâand not less To that sweet home of heart-stored happiness! Where all my soul's most cherished treasures dwell, Loved with affection words are weak to tell, That home in home!âthat Shrine within a Shrineâ That thrice-prized mine, amidst Earth's richest mineâ That star set in my England's star-bright skiesâ That Paradise within a Paradise! My child!âmy child!âI am not near thee now To part the hair that clusters o'er thy brow, And plant ten thousand kisses thereâto view Thy faÃ«ry joys, and ah! to share them too; To watch thy golden slumbers when thou'rt laid In Innocency's vesture pure arrayed, Like a tired bird within its warm sweet nest, And all thy raptures are composed to rest! And oh! to soothe thy little sorrows still, For infancy is not exempt from ill! Though soon effaced from its transparent thought The shadows there, by some slight grievance brought, While its expanding and upspringing mind Still forward flies, and leaves all pain behind. My child!âthe music of thy laughter now I dream ofâbut I hear notâo'er thy brow Wander ten thousand meanings new and sweet, I may not see themâmay not guide thy feet To spots of pleasantness, now that the Spring That calls to life each bright and blooming thing Is bursting over England's golden fields, Till every bank a wealth of blossoms yields For Childhood's dimpled hands!â'tis glorious here In this warm azure Italyâmost clear, Most exquisite the pure and perfumed air, The sky unshadowed, and the sunshine fair; And fair the almond-blossoms clustered close Upon the loaded boughâwhile many a rose Trails its resplendent wonder, richly bowed Beneath its beauty as beneath a cloud Along the trellised walk or fountain side, A dazzling trophyâNature's loveliest pride. But oh! my child, my child! I fain would be Now wandering 'midst our English haunts with thee, Amongst those cowslip-scattered fields so bright, They flash one glistening lake of living light, One deep and shining galaxy of gold, A glory and a luxury to behold, While their massed sunshine-hoards wave to and fro, Beneath the softest breezes that may blow! And load the air with sweets that greet the sense With sudden gusts of witching redolence. My feelings and my fancies are with ye, Haunts of my early daysâfar o'er the Sea! They are with yeâold woods of deepest shade, Where in my childhood's joyous hours I played With yeâye winding paths and hawthorn lanes, Where oft I listened to the bird's blithe strains, When most those strains of joy appeared to agree With mine own Spirit's unbroken melody!â With ye, ye violet-clustered banks, that pour A flood of sweetness from your fragrant storeâ With ye, ye fair fields, where the daisy-flower, The humblest offspring of the sunny hour, Is breaking like a star from the deep moss Which silvery dews so sparklingly emboss. Oh! happiest haunts of joyaunce and delight, To Memory's tearful vision far too bright: My feelings and my fancies are with ye, But I am distantâbarred by Land and Seaâ And but rejoin yeâwhen upon the wings Upborne, of my unchained imaginings But oh! so well ye are painted on my mind So clearly there, by unseen hand designed, That I 'mongst ye can find my wand'ring way, Lit by a light beyond the light of day!â Can pierce, unchecked, your old beloved retreats, And joyously retrack my well-known beats; My former paths can, step by step, retrace, And haunt in spirit each familiar place; Nayâcan at once those different scenes recall, And gather in one glowing Pictureâall!â And shed abroad the presence of my thought, The rapture-kindled and the joy-o'erfraught; O'er all those loved and lovely haunts distinct, But by the Heart so well and closely linked, Till, while the dear illusion gains and grows, One Picture and one Passion they compose! One outstretched viewâone vision they become, And I remain with pleased amazement dumb! Oh! Memory! thy sweet Omnipresence gives A tenfold joy which the o'erwrought Soul receives; Rapt in that rich imaginative trance Which sees a world of wonders at a glance; No limits can the dreaming sense surround, The exalted fancy knows no stubborn bound; The glowing, soaring, and creative mind, By no dull bars is circled or confined, All is contained within its wide embraceâ Tamer of Time and Sovereign over space!â It maketh its own Circumstance and Place; It biddeth the outward, actual world obey, Or shrink to nothing underneath its sway; Or it uprears a sweet world of its own, Where love and gladness can have part alone; But when with Memory and Affection twined, It may not leave its earthly sphere behind, And but sublimes, etherializes all, Which thus is bound in its triumphant thrall; Even so 'tis now with meâand it is wellâ And long in such glad mood I fain would dwell. Now, I at one blest Vision can behold A hundred happy haunts beloved of old; A hundred glowing prospects seem to be Conjoined in one enchanted Unity; A hundred smiling scenes appear to arise Before my lighted and enraptured eyes; A hundred lovely landscapes do unite Into one Paradise of perfect Light! Their various beauties blending into one, Like scattered Stars immingling to a Sun! Their charms distinct, at once divinely grow To one Perfectionâne'er beheld below Save by thy fine and vision-haunted eye, Bright FancyâVictor o'er Reality; So do an hundred separate leaves compose The full and finished beauty of a Rose. Sweet Memory! thy bright omnipresence 'tis That yields the Spirit thus a tenfold bliss! My own fair Home in England! fairer far Than loveliest image, or of Rose or Star; Lovely as Love itselfâthou the Unforgot! How well I knew each path of thineâeach spotâ How well I know, distinctly to recall Thy various scenesâthy different features all. No little knoll is thereâno tiny nook, On which even now I cannot clearly look! And nothing that belongs to thee but brings To me a joy that round my heart's core clings. And oh! no trivial circumstance and slight, But yields me some warm transport of delight: How well I know each dim and dewy bed Where the rathe snowdrop hangs its fragile head; Or where the frail anemone's meek flower Looks meet to grace a fairy's favourite bower; Or where the primrose constellations shine, On the mossed bank, or by the path's mazed line, In paly brilliancy soft, calm, serene, And throw a new enchantment o'er the scene; Or where the daffodils, in proud array, Blaze back the sunshine and bepaint the day, And where the rarer lily of the vale, Transparentlyâetherially pale, Cladâa sweet amazon in silvery mailâ And armed with shield of emeralds dark and deep, Doth all the air in softest fragrance steep; Or, dearer yet than theseâthan all beside, Where the surpassing violet doth abide! As the branched veins of Cytherea, blue, And with her musked sighs, pure perfume too. Even precious as the ambrosial-streaming hair, Whose cloud of Beauty veiled her shoulders fair. The violet! why the very name exhales An odour, and breathes forth delicious talesâ The violet! why the very thought appears To sun away the shadows of dark years, To give me back a world of Love and Hope, And make me half forget to doubt or droop; To bid the Actual and the True look fair, The Timeâthe Climeâa charm familiar wear; To bringâsince my chained step may move not free, My own bright happy England unto me! Nor let that place of beauty be forgot, That gentleâthat frequented favourite spot, Where the may-flower boughs, clustered sweet and close, And perfumed every zephyr as it rose; Nor the dear gardens with their shading bowers And rainbow-beds of choice and odorous flowers, Where the light summer-fly and honey-bee, Sang out their matin tunes so joyously! Be none forgotâbut all fair-imaged forthâ Oh! Dream of Gladness, what art thou not worth? In their own native beautyâand in all The charms that fancy to her aid can call? Oh Love and Memory, ye are wond'rous powers, And fair ye make this cloudy world of ours; But your consummate Visions may not lastâ They droop before the Truth's cold cutting blast; They die beneath the Present's crushing tread, And leave a heart as droopingâor as dead: And so my fleeting Happiness departs, Nor Fancy's self, with all her gentIest arts, Can now that withered Happiness restore, It was a rapture, but is now no more! Sea! lovely awful Seaâwhen the Earth is scared Unto our prejudiced and sick regard, As 'twere by sorrows we have suffered there, Gladly we turn to thee, thou ever fairâ Thou ever gloriousâyea we turn to thee, As thou our mighty Comforter couldest be; Our gracious Counsellor and our pitying Friend, On whom we might with fearless trust depend, And our sublime Companion!âas though thou From thy stupendous state couldst deign to bow, And lower thy voice of billows and of storms, And soften thy severe and glorious forms, To commune with a mortal yet more frail Than thy light foam-wreaths driven before the galeâ And petty as the sand-grains on thy shore, By new-piled heaps so quickly covered o'er. But yetâthou wond'rous and thou awful sea, The Earth-sick turn their weary eyes on thee; And truly, when thou will'st to smile serene, They look upon a deep and lovely scene. The weary ones of Earth to the Ocean turn, And struggle to forget to weep and mourn! Oh! ever lovelyâhowsoe'er it show, In sweeping tempest or in measured flow; Oh! ever lovely is that rolling main, And ever triumphing in beauty's reign; Oh! ever lovelyâwhether veiled in gloom, And darkly yawning like an opening tomb, Or blazoned with thy sweet reflections pale, Fair Moon! what time thou dost through Sky Land sail! Oh! ever lovelyâbut how beauteous now, When the blue Heaven might earthwards seem to bow In very love and peaceâwhen sea and shore Are flooded with one stream of brightness o'er, And o'er thy sunshine-fretted surface plays, Proud Oceanâthis rich restless crown of rays! The Angel of Consolations deign to be, Imperial Element! even now to me, Since thou hast thus serenely laid aside Thy startling awfulness and haughty pride, Yet ever awfulâwhatsoe'er thy mood, Thou never-fathomed, never-understoodâ Thou glorious mysteryâmighty and profound, Outstretched, sublime, without a bar or bound, We gaze with wonder and delight on thee, In thy triumphant greatness proud and free, And own that thou, transcendant Ocean! art A grand creationâmatchless and apart. Oh! ever awfulâin thine every state, Whether the Tempest-Genii round thee wait, And marshall forth their terrors at thy word, And watch the pleasure of their Sovran Lord; Or the light Zephyrs their soft wings unfurl, And scarcely dare thy slumbering waves to curl. Oh! ever awfulâon thy billowy throne, Though not thus wholly for thyself alone, But to the mind thy mighty aspect brings, A deep, deep thought of dread and glorious things. Thou seemest the noblest image here below, Of all the Soul doth seek to view and know, Of Glory, and of Majesty, and Power; And are not these thy attributes and dower, However in faint degree to thee they are lent, Compared with that thou seemest to represent? Oh! for awhile, yet lovely awful sea, The Angel of my Consolations be! How perfect is the dazzling water's hue, Whose exquisite and most etherial blue Is caught from Heavens without a cloud, whose smile From this vain world all shades of care should wile; How lustrous, on this clear and glowing day, The watery Empire's splendour of display! The Beauty of the far-extended scene Brings Dreams of Beauty, smiling and serene, Unto the enkindling and delighted thought, A world of glowing dreams, unwooedâunsoughtâ And many a gleaming vision pure and fair Floats by upon the blue enchanted air!â Arrayed in loveliest hues to inspire and bless, As Loveliness attracted Loveliness!â As though Enchantments from Enchantments sprung, And evermore a new-born brightness flungâ The Beautiful brought forth the Beautifulâ And nothing there might be of dark or dull! Oh! this delicious, calming, soothing sound, That calleth forth responses sweet around! This most antique and perfect melodyâ This everlasting Anthem of the Seaâ Whose glorious tones in the Elder ages sent A hushing awe with solemn gladness blent Through the rapt Listener's raised and chastened soul, While on his ear the sounds of beauty stole, That still, as deeply they unfailing float, (A Hymn in every organ-pealing note!) To all suggest exalted thoughts and pureâ They that the same for ever shall endure! Till that dread hour, when every sound shall be Even thine, thou proud and never-silenced Sea! Lost in that deep and dreadful Trumpet-call, Which shall in awful triumph roll o'er all! Yea! even thy voice of thundering might shall then Fail, like the smothered voice of fear-struck men, And not one murmur from thy breast arise Of all thy dread and echoing melodies! But let me list now to thy voice, which still Delights the sense, and with prevailing skill The hollow ear of Night can richly fill, And charm its rugged sternness all away, Heightening the heavenly Harmonies of Day With its unparalleled enchantment too, Old as Creation's selfâyet ever new! These seem but the echoes of that glorious voiceâ While thou dost in auspicious mood rejoice What time we hear themâlingering by thy side And watching theeâin thy triumphant pride! Thus in the peaceful hours of this sweet morn The various sounds from the inland places borne, Softened by distance down, appear to be Reverberations lowâOh! voiceful Sea! Of thine unceasing chaunt's deep harmony! All blent and all united to a strain, Which soothes the soul and stills the restless brain. I must not cast unheeding eyes on all The beauty here spread round me, though a pall Of inly-woven gloom may half obscure To me fair Nature's various portraiture! I should not cast unmindful thoughts on things Which ought to stir Life's deepest, purest springs, (And force a sense of sacred loveliness Even where all other feelings by distress Were crushed, and changed, and darkened, and o'erborne, By cares distracted, and by sufferings torn! By trials wasted, and by troubles worn! Till long-endured and never-ceasing care Assume the harsher features of Despair!) Nor do I thusâbut in a softened moodâ Though still at times vain fancies will intrude, I linger 'mid the bright perfections here, And chase afar the phantoms of my Fear. Yes! carefully and curiously I look On this fair prospectâtears, meanwhile, that shook My heart to shed but some few hours ago, Now softly and with soothing influence flowâ Most watchfully I thinkâand bind among My heavier feelings pure thoughts fresh and strong, Which though from the Earth upspringing, seem to shine Tinged with the finer hues of Heavenâdivine! Among my shadowy memories, Hopes I bind, Which shall not all be scattered on the wind; Most studiously and strenuously I strive From mine own dreams the darkening shades to drive, And still in some slight measure do succeed, And feel from many a galling fetter freed! There is a Joy in Sorrowâand in Woe A luxury, which all feeling natures knowâ There is a Joy in Sorrow!âand she hath Some lovely blossoms scattered o'er her path. Those who have never wept and mourned below Nor borne a dark reverse, nor felt a blow, Have but imperfect knowledge of Delight, Howe'er it seem for ever in their sight! Oh, Sorrow!âbright the prospects thou'st reveal'd, And deep the blessings are 'tis thine to yield, For not of this World are theyânot of thisâ Thy hints of happinessâthy beams of blissâ They come from other and serener spheres, Unchill'd by falsehood, and uncheck'd by fearsâ In thy deep mines are costly jewels found, In thy dark skies resplendent stars abound. Oh, Sorrow! thy chief blessing to the mind Is when thou lead'st it to leave Earth behindâ When thou dost wrench it from all worldly things, And bidd'st it soar upon immortal wings!â For all can prove but Vanity below, And gilded hollowness and empty showâ And though some loudly boast that they are blest, Oft aches a gloomy void within the breast; And still entangled 'midst their very joys, And bound to Pleasure's glare, and Folly's noise; And by their countless earthly ties enchained, And closely to the World's vain service trained; Absorbed in things that swiftly pass away, And firmly, deeply fettered to their clay, Without one lofty dream, one bright desire, To dwell amidst far happier things and higher, Without one glorious movement in the Soul To rise above cold Destiny's controulâ One breathing of a splendid discontentâ With rich expectancies profoundly blent They walk upon their smooth unchanging way, Nor from the accustomed paths attempt to stray. But thou canst teach far loftier things below, And noblest benefits canst thou bestow, Oh! mighty Sorrow! and 'tis thine to yield A golden harvest from no earthly field! There is a charm in Sorrow, when we spring Out of ourselves on thought's exulting wingâ There is a charm in Sorrow, when we rise Out of ourselves full gladlyâwith the Skies To hold a tongueless conferenceâand to learn Such truths as make the aspiring Spirit burn And pant to increase its knowledge' heav'nly store, And many a deeper secret to explore! There is a charm in sacred Sorrow still! For those who long have borne with mortal ill, And bowed to mortal suffering and dark Care, And breathed Dejection's dull and heavy airâ And battled with a harsh and bitter fate, And writhed beneath stern Misery's leaden weightâ Out of themselves with more delight can spring, And soar away from every mortal thing, With more of gladness and with more of zeal, While to their Soul the inspiring glow they feelâ Than those who find a thousand charms on Earth, And mingle most in its delight and mirth! Yea! we who deeply and who dearly know The shadowy paths and hidden depths of Woe, Who long have been afflicted, often tried, And much oppressed and grievedâcan cast aside Ourselves at once, more joyously than those Who thus dismiss not dim regrets and woesâ Who thus no miseries and no griefs dismiss, But bright realities of glowing blissâ But busy schemes, and hopes of restless aim, And all that most the entrammelled thoughts can claim, The affections and the passions of the heartâ Too dear and lovely to be laid apartâ The glad emotions of the unclouded mind, Which they would little wish to leave behindâ The engagements and light pleasures of the day, Which they can scarce desire to put away. Sorrow! a glorious privilege is thine, Known to the votaries of thy Shadowy Shrine! Thou hast a privilege and advantage still, And those who climb thy steep and rugged hill Behold a prospect wonderful and wide, Which far surpasseth Nature's noblest pride; But few would follow in thy solemn train, Few would endure thy yoke of gloom and pain, To prove the advantage and partake the good, To snatch the meed and share the exalted mood! Yet who can doubt that one rich glimpse and taste Midst this World's glare, and noise, and strife, and hasteâ Of things eternal and of things sublime, Things not terrestrial, not confined to timeâ Not of this petty lifeâthis mortal birthâ Not of these Elementsâthis changeful Earthâ But of the everlasting Worlds above, The Worlds of deathless joy and endless love, Where change can never come, nor death intrude, Nor evil enter, nor foul sin delude; Where bliss is not precarious or confined, But ample and eternal as the mindâ Is deeply, brightly, exquisitely worth All the vain pleasures and delights of Earth, All its poor comforts and its passing joys, Its glare and strife, its hurry and its noiseâ And that bright glimpse, that sweet and sacred taste, Most precious 'mid Life's wild and sterile waste, Can never be so rapturously enjoyed, So utterly unchecked, and unalloyed, As when the escaping and the exulting mind Leaves blights and shadows and regrets behindâ The cloudâthe stormâthe dungeon and the chainâ The rod of punishmentâthe rack of painâ Thenâthen indeed it is we gladly spring Out of ourselves at once with conquering wing, Out of ourselves at once in some blest hour Of peace renewed and renovated power; Out of ourselves at onceânor stay to throw One glance behind upon our World of Woe! Out of ourselves, to mingle and unite With the deep Universe of life and light; Out of ourselves, to mingle and to blend With things that have no limit and no end! Thenâthen we fling undoubtingly away The vain and vile enthralments of our clay, And throw, unhesitating, throw aside Our poor Mortality's encumbering pride; While other feelings, and while different ties, And fairer prospects opening to our eyesâ And new resources, and affections new, And fresh impressions and emotions tooâ New aims, hopes, interests, objects, and desires, And purer fervours and more hallow'd fires Fill and engage the whole enraptured Soul, While scenes divine before its view unroll! Loveliness dwells on every side!âaround Is matchless Beauty spread without a boundâ Beauty and Loveliness on every side! Immortal Nature in her state and pride! And all that is most smiling and most bland Salutes the Stranger in this peerless Land! And all that is most witching and most fair Arrests the Wanderer's footsteps every where! Yet Nature here, even here, 'tis certain, hath Her more appalling forms of gloom and wrath, And her more awful hintsâand sterner moodsâ While 'mid her own most glorious scenes she broods! Broods 'mid her own enchantmentsâyet, the while, Plots fearful mischief with a Circe's guile. The ground is hollow where the Wanderer treads, A Hell beneath its Heaven-like surface spreadsâ And direst terrors slumbering there are hid, Like Serpents foul, the fairest flowers amid. And let us turn our dazzled eyes to where Yon angry Mountain darkens up the Airâ A fearful Eminence!âYea, turn and look At those dense clouds of sunshine-blotting Smokeâ Those black and blasted sides, that threatening brow, So stern and gloomy and terrific nowâ And own that where the brightest Scenes are spread, There oft-times frown the darkest Forms of dread! Yet all is girt with peace, and nought disturbs That exquisite placidity which curbs To its most sweet Dominion all around, While floats a freshness from the dewy ground, A laughing light lives in the Sea and Sky, A breathing beauty o'er the scene doth lieâ A fettering fragrance streams upon the air, And all seems gladlyâinnocently fair! Then let us taste the rapture and the charm, Nor shrink with cold distrust and vain alarmâ Enjoy these bright hours in their tranquil flow, Nor image fearful scenes of future woeâ Nor cast a look of sorrowing, sick dismay Back to the horrors of a by-gone day. Oft-times we join in festal mirth, and yet Unnumbered Dangers round our paths are set; A thousand winged Deaths are hovering round, With treacherous Fates all elements abound, And hideous Perils gird us night and day, To ruin and o'erwhelm us and betray! Still, still 'twere surely weak and most unwise To close 'gainst every charm our careful eyes, Because the hidden ill may there be veiled By which we yet may darkly be assailed, Then shall we turn in shrinking doubt and fear From all the lavish splendours scattered here, Because concealed the glorious show beneath May dwell the forms of Danger and of Death? No! let us pluck and wreathe the Time's fair flowers, We count by years a Life that is of hours. The stilliness and balminess around Hath tranquillized my restlessness!âno sound That is not ministrant to gentlest peace Is heard on this fair shoreâso should you cease To heave in vain distrustfulness, my heart! To throb in fond disquietude and smart, And rock with troublous beatingsâyou would bring Your sorrows here too rashly, and would cling Too madly to your dull and moody cares, And slight the glory Nature's aspect wears.â Ah! surely such a glad and lovely spot Cannot be fitting haunt for one whose lot Is Griefâand whose dejected wayward will Is to abide by that dark sentence still, And in that heavy Shadow to remain, And abject bend before the powers of Pain! One who hath made that bitter choice, in sooth, Despite that still, inspired, and smiling Youth A faint soft light about her pathway flings, And throws a beauty o'er all earthly things; Since still doth Youth, 'midst Fate's o'ershadowing glooms, Bind these reluctant brows with some few blooms, Some scattered flowers, that, dim and pale of hue, Are fainting for the sunshine and the dew, With parched cups and colours half effaced, Such flowers as could but shine amid a waste; With broken stems, and with wan drooping leaves, Such flowers as only weeping Sorrow weaves To shed a pensive smile round recent Graves! So dull and scentless, and so fallen away From what they were ere Grief's o'er-clouding day. But shall I then, thus abjectly consent To dwell, beneath the yoke of Sorrow bent; And shall I make so harsh and dire a choice, And turn away from Hope's dear whisp'ring voice? And say with dark Distrust, or passionate Pride, âBy my own shadowy Lot will I abide.â No! Resignation's self should watch and wait To snatch a kind reprieve from frowning Fateâ It is not Resignation to bow down In still prostration underneath that frown, 'Gainst every brighter dream the eyes to close, And court the long continuance of our woes, Without an effort and without a hope, Content 'mid dull Dejection's shades to droop, And thus in dark ungracious mood to say, âI will not more be won from Grief away,â To embrace with shadows and with memories dwell, And fear the touch that yet might make us well; The stricken heart with stubborn Will to steel 'Gainst each soft touch that yet might soothe and healâ And still to murmur, in a proud despair, âWeepingâaye! endless weeping be my share;â And still to each kind questioning to reply, â'Tis Weepingâendless weeping till I die!â To encourage and to foster in the breast The impassioned Anguish and the sick Unrest; To enthrone even as an idol in the Soul That Grief to which we dedicate the Whole; And to enshrine for ever in the heart The Pain from which we thus refuse to part! This is not Resignation!â'tis a tide Of impious Passion and impetuous Prideâ 'Tis our Humanity's presumption still That must assert a choiceâand have a Will! Our fiery Stubbornnessâthrough weal or woeâ That will not thus far and no farther go. Our mortal Nature's weak and helpless ire, That leads us thus to heap our funeral pyre, And sacrifice ourselves to our distress In luxury of delirious recklessness. This is not Resignationâthis is not What thou serenely counsellestâsweet Spot! With all thy soft Air-breathings light and free, And Water-voices from the sounding Sea! And I will list to theseâand lull my mind, And strive to be in humble truth resigned, Nor deeper seek to plunge the envenomed dart Which Mercy's self would pluck from out my heartâ Nor boast that Resignation must be mine, Because my Soul to suffering I consign, And dare to dedicate my darkened years To vain regrets and unavailing tears! Nor rashly cry, with fixed obdurate will, âLet me abide by Grief's dark sentence still!â Naples, 1834. LINES ON MORNING. WRITTEN AT NAPLES. 'Tis Morning! she is a glad Reveller here: What time she speeds on her illumed career!â And makes all the Earth her Image!âwhile she seems Reflected from these rosy-running streams! And painted on the beauty of the flowers, And kindling 'mid the rich sheen of the bowersâ On Earth etherial, as amidst the sky A Lightâa Lifeâa Powerâa Majesty! But yet within that sky how wondrous fairâ How overpowering in her splendour there! While on her Forehead's Royalty is shown One JewelâOneâin its own self a Crown! One Jewelâbut how exquisite a one, The World-awakeningâspace-enlightening Sun! And where else glows that Sun so clearly bright?â Within the Heaven a living Heaven of Light! Morning! thou art a lovely reveller here; What time thou speedest upon thy glad career; Oh! wheresoe'er in watchful mood we turn, Her breath is breathing, and her glances burn. She makes all the Earth her Imageâwhile she fliesâ And to One Glory kindles all the skies! And fair and wide her boundless magic flings, As in an extacy of joy she springs O'er the flushed waters of this brightened sea, Which seems her Giant-Worshipper to be; While every wave is smiling back her smiles, And rolling golden round an hundred isles. Lo! how in freedom and in might she speeds (While nought delays her, and while nought impedes) Along the mountains, with a foot of fire, Buoyed by an Energy that ne'er can tire; Earth, Air, and Ocean, answer to her call, And bless her Presence Beatifical! And hail her in all homage and all love, While she doth in this light of Beauty move! There's not a little wreath of passing cloud That is not to her golden service vowed; And not a lowly flower that doth not wear Her colours nowâthat burn upon the air, And blaze along the Earth, free, clear, and far, Till all like rosesâcrimsoned roses are! And not a chrystal fount that murmuring plays, But, like a fount of fire, defies the gaze! The Enchantress Morningâhow as she proceeds On her sweet progress, and unpausing speedsâ Brightening and brighteningâfair and fairer still, O'er Land and Sea, o'er wood, and vale, and hillâ How doth sheâas with winged haste she springs Assert her Empire o'er all earthly things, And touch them as with keen Ithuriel spear, Till traced in bright distinctness they appear. Forth at her stroke they unresisting start, Distinguished, and developed, and apart; Forth at her stroke they startâbroad, clear, and plain, In true revealment of themselves again!â In their own shapes and forms stand boldly out, Nor leave the mind to wonder and to doubt! While in her sweepy sway and mystic might, Walks frowningly abroad the solemn Nightâ And spreads o'er all the mantle of her gloom, Dark as the clouds and shades of mortal doom. These things may be distortedâmaskedâdisguisedâ By the foiled Watcher vainly scrutinized! A thousand different objects they may seem, Vague and confused as visions of a dream; A thousand new appearances assume, While opening seem the portals of the tomb, To cast forth haunting shapes, uncouth and grim, And shadows that 'mongst circling shadows dim, As in a sea of floating darkness, swim; Such groupes fantastical are gathering round, Such wildering mockeries the sense confound! Here frown a host of phantoms in our path, There throng embodied forms of threat'ning wrath; Here dread and overwhelming barriers rise Before the doubting and deluded eyes; There startling prospects lenthening out extend, Still on and onâthat never find an end! And Nothing is, but as 'tis masked and marred By Conquering Nightâthe shadowed and the starred; All contrasts, contradictions, and extremes, Are mingling seen, as in a sick man's dreams. But when the enkindling and outshining Morn Is like a new-created Angel bornâ A new-created Angel brightly given Unto the enraptured and rejoicing Heaven, How are those forms, so changed and so disguised, At once disclosed, arranged, and harmonized; At once, when touched by her Ithuriel spear, Made to stand forthâin revelation clear! At once unveiled in that transcendant blaze, And opened out before the observer's gaze, Bare to the bright sky, to the sunshine bare, Exposed in all their true proportions there. Oh! could the Morning, with triumphant sway, Thusâas by stroke of magicâclear away The endless mists and shadows frowning round Man's Universal Heartâdeep, dark, profound; Could she command that masked and hidden Heart Forth in revealment of itself to startâ Aye! could she show, uncovered and revealed, All that for ages there hath lain concealed, (And much is there that is perforce even bowed Beneath the veil, the shadow, and the cloud; Much that weak language never could disclose, That outward action but distorted shows. Though Myriads share the Feeling and the Thought, By none to light and observation brought, Those Thoughts and Feelings of long centuries wear The Chain of Silence, and her dull yoke bear!) How newâhow awfulâand how deep and strange The World around wereâin that startling change! How wond'rousâhow o'erpowering would it be, Could the Great Heart of Our Humanity At once be laid in all its workings bare; Yet who to gaze on that dread Sight would dare? Yet who would dare to gaze on the unveiled Deep, The exposed Abyssâcould any Power but sweep The Shadows and the covering mists aside, And open forth the astounding Prospect wide, And with a stroke of more than Magic chase The clouds that claspâthe deep folds that embrace? And thus to curious observation yield That mighty and immeasurable field? Earth's countless, myriad mansions of the Deadâ Her crowded sepulchresâunbounded spreadâ At one wild instant open'd to the sight With all their hideous secrets bared to light, Might ne'er such awful fearful mysteries show 'Mongst all that lurks their lampless domes below! That Under-Worldâdiscovered to the view (As at the Judgement-hourâwhen graves burst through Shall give their tenants up in countless throngs, Men of all climes, and births, and stamps, and tongues) Might ne'er a more o'erpow'ring sight present Than would that World Unknownâif thus were rent Its shrouding veils of gloomâdense, deep, and black, And its dread curtains were e'en thus drawn back! But Morning! not thy keenest brightest ray Shall ever clear those covering clouds awayâ Disperse those shadowsâor display that scene. For that a ray must shineâfar, far more keen! Far, far more keen, more dazzling, and more bright Than any that compose thy crown of light. Those hidden depths thou never canst illume, Thou never canst pierce through those folds of gloom! Alone the Almighty and All-Seeing Eye Can dart through those dense shrouds of mystery! And doubtless it is rightâ'tis doubtless well That skill nor power should those thick shades dispel. What spectacles of awe should we behold! What unimagined scenes should be unrolled! The old laurelled Wars by fervent Poets sung, When kingly Chieftains mixed the Hosts amongâ When marshalled Nations trampling trod the field, And every breast with stern resolve was steeled, When slaughtered victims pressed the ploughed up ground, While clattering arms and thundering wheels rang round, And the scythed chariots drove with deadly haste Through those thinned ranksâby headlong ruin chased, Those mighty Wars, that left on Earth's changed face A terrible and sanguinary trace; Depopulating Realmsâat one fierce blow (So copiously the crimson tides did flow In their fast-swelling and unebbing stream, Appalling Earth with a new Deluge-dream!) Uprooting even whole Races of Mankind Before their fearful shockâfierce, desperate, blindâ And in their hideous and unnatural sway Heaven's bright Creationâin its fair array Heaven's bright Creationâthat hath proudly stood Since Heaven approvedâand blessedâand called it good! Dark plunging as with mad and savage aim (While fiery throes convulsed its startled frame) Into a Chaosâgloomier than before, All peace disturbed, all glory darkened o'er, All HÃ¡rmony derangedâall charm defacedâ All Energies destroyedâall forms displaced! Those mighty Wars, so stormy and so dread, Which black Destruction's gloom so widely spread. With all their horrors, all their tumults dire, (Such horrors as inspired the Homeric Lyre) With all their dreadful sounds and ghastly sights, Their barbarous revels and their murderous rites, Were but as harmless sportâas infant's play The pastime of a summer's holiday; With those compared that darkly fiercely rage In man's deep hidden heartâage after age, Could the rapt bard from these withdraw the veil And paint their truthâin terrible detail, How would those wars, that shook the world of old By lips and lyres inspired, so proudly told In insignificance obscurely sinkâ And fade, and vanish, and to nothing shrink. Aye! could the Bard those fields of Battle sing, And sound their terrors on his echoing string, Their fiery struggles and tempestuous shocksâ Their deadly strife, (whose wrath all picturing mocks) The laurelled Wars with all their fame of yore Would waneâthose dark unlaurelled Wars before! Alas! those hideous conflictsâwild and deepâ Thatâstorm-like through the inmost bosomâsweep; Broil kindling broilâand feud engendering feud, Still evermore with fiercer zeal renewed. Alas! the ills that spring from those wild broils, The wasteâthe blightâthe ruins and the spoils; The hopes obscuredâthe fair dreams overthrown, The gloomâthe desolation left alone. Alas! the fearful woundsâthe desperate scars, Which they must bear who fight in those stern wars! The heavy sufferance and the long despair, Which oftâtoo oft, is their appointed share; The aching wearinessâthe hollow void, The aims defeatedâand the bliss destroyed; The unblazoned doomâthe Untrophied Solitude, The dark regrets, unbidden, that intrude!â No deadly Conflicts may with these compare, Save those which once, Heaven's glorious regions fair, With uproar fierce and boundless fury shook, When hostile arms the Apostate Angel tookâ When wildly raged the accursed and rebel Host, With haughty threat and with blaspheming boast, Against the Embattelled Seraphim who rose, In radiant league, to overthrow their fated foes; While stormy Discord, with gigantic stride, Made way through those bright courts and mansions wideâ And startling Clamour, with distracting sound, Stirred fiercely all the Elysian Air around. Those dark and dreadful wars can match alone With the awful feuds to man's locked bosom known; The stern and savage conflicts that take place In that sealed spanâa span out-sweeping Space!â Where mighty Powers are met in stern array, And struggle sore for Conquest and for Sway; With deep and ardent aimâimpelledâinspired, With strong and strenuous purpose armed and firedâ Still battling step by stepâand hour by hour, Disputing inch by inchâPower ranged 'gainst Powerâ Without cessation battling wildly on, A field contested stillânow lostânow won; Now these confused and check'd, in doubt retreatâ Now once again the adverse forces meet; Now those in turn seem scattered and subdued, And hotly pressed, and hurryingly pursued, While still fresh Legions to the Combat pour, And but embroil the embroiled Confusion moreâ Add to the tumult and the struggle aid, And o'er the prospect cast a sterner shade, Till wild disorder, wrath, and fevered strife, Seem the conditions of this painful Lifeâ And in the bosom's torn and tortured core Wake new and worse commotion evermore. The impetuous passions and the imperious will, Raise their unhallowed standard boldly still, While myriad lesser instincts of the Soul Flock round that standard as its folds unroll; Allies by myriads, though of elfin size, Yet full of might and fearful influence, rise, And round the Banners of that Battle crowd; Wrapped in a dense impenetrable cloud, Surrounded by a close and guarded wall, That hides from view those mystic conflicts all; And it is wellâof trouble and of care Each hath enough in his own lot to bear, Each hath his own ordained and ample share! And dire and painful 'twere indeed to view The fiery sufferings borne by others too. Oh! if these mighty Wars resemble those 'Twixt Heaven's bright Seraphim and Heaven's foul foes, Would that a farther likeness they might claim, And evermore be found to end the same!â Would that the dark and Evil Powers might fall, And sink, and droop beneath a conquering thrallâ Would that the treacherous and rebellious Host Might flee awayâfor ever crushed and lost! And by the arms of Faith and Truth o'ercome, For ever bend unto a hopeless doom! But who shall rashly with presumption say That here, where Evil hath so dire a sway, Such glorious palmy triumphs oft befall, Though helps divine be proffered unto allâ Too oftâtoo oft the impious hosts of Sin Usurp the Empire and the Victory win! Make theirs the Masteryâand the advantage gain, And far and wide extend their fatal reign; The brighter, purer, holier Powers expell, And make the ruined Soul their lasting Hell, For where these darkening dwell, where these remain, There must be found a Hell of wrath and pain. Great Nature's mighty jars, when dark and wild, Dense thunder-clouds on thunder-clouds are piled, Till frowns the Firmamentâa solid night, And forth the Giant tempest stalks in might; When rave her hurricanes with headlong shocks, And prone to Earth, the old trees, that stood like rocks Through countless Winters, loudly-crashing fall, And bear their blighted foliage for a pall; When, fierce and high, her stern Volcanoes throw Their flame-wrought banners, waving to and fro, And light the World as to its ruin so! When her triumphant Seas impetuous wake, As o'er their stated bounds they sought to break, And whelm all Nature in Destruction dire, While sweep their bellowing Surges high and higher; When in the terrors of their licensed hour, Her swallowing Earthquakes tumble town and tower, And change at once the outward face of things With alteration such as time scarce brings Great Nature's mighty jars, though stern and dreadâ And though around a chilling awe they spread, Are but as dim-drawn traceries, faint and slight, Of those that in the fury of their might, In man's dark viewless bosom fiercely rage Through lapse of seasons, and through every age. Yea! they are but feeble shadowings forth, and frail Of those that there, distractingly prevail! ThereâHurricanes of more o'erpowering wing To instantaneous life impetuous spring; There Tempests of more dire and dangerous force Sweep all before them in their lawless course; And yet more terrible Volcanoes glow, And scatter round them Wrath and wasting Woe; And wilder Surges darkly swell on high, And roll in threatening gloom thick-thundering byâ Nor might the mountain-rocking Earthquake spread A fierce confusion half so deep or dread As do the fiery Passion heart-quakes there, That swallow all things in a stern despair. Oh! let the Veilâunrivenâunraised remain, And spare the Visionâthat were sadâand vain! If the clear promptings of our own deep hearts Can teach us not to act our human parts, Then neither would the hearts of others, shown (With all their mysteriesâall their dreamsâmade known) Suffice to lead us on our Earthly way, Or prompt the parts that we through Life should play! No! we should study closely evermore The secrets of our own sealed bosom's coreâ We have the Teacher and the Prophets thereâ Would we but mark them with assiduous care, And brood above their lessons day by day, Nor turn with thoughtless disrespect awayâ Then let the unlifted curtain, dark and deep, 'Twixt us and others' hidden Spirits sweep. Morning! thou lovely and thou radiant Time, Fairer than ev'n thyself, in this fair Clime! Thou'rt still the sweetest portion of our day, Howe'er the rest may shine with cloudless ray! Deep sultry Noon may passionately glow, And golden glories o'er all Nature throw, And burning Sunset flush the Earth and Sky With one supreme and dazzling crimson dye, What time that Sun puts all his splendours on, As though his Empire then were newly won!â And dwells surroundedâconscious and elateâ With all his gorgeous Royaltiesâand State! Morning thou still artâsweetest, fairest, bestâ Heaven's whisp'ring MessengerâEarth's welcomed guest! And oh! how lovely in this loveliest Land, Where thou bring'st hoards of treasure in thy handâ And sowest the common groundâthe common air, With diamond wealth and pearly riches rareâ Where each Elysian spotâeach flowery place, Breathes back new Beauty on thy beauteous Face! LINES ON A FINE PROSPECT AT NAPLES. This is a Prospect that must brightly preach The purest truths the ennobled Soul can reachâ That Thought by Thought its upward march must lead Unto a free and soaring height indeed! It speaks with tongues than trumpet-tongues more clear, Though to that Soul appealingânot to the earâ And pours instruction through its depths the while How sweetly, when a Sunbeam and a Smile Are its chief bright auxiliariesâand bear These lovely lessons deep, and pure, and rare, To the rapt Mind's recesses, where they shine Like glittering torches in some shadowy Mine, Thus fair illumined with its treasures all, And sparkling like some proud Enchanter's Hallâ That Sunbeam and that Smile so warmly smite The wakened sense with kindlings of delight! And what are those deep lessons?âwhat may be Those lofty truths, which Sky, and Land, and Sea, Join in unveiling to the Spirit nowâ To which it doth with trusting reverence bow? Those truths are such as lift the inner weight From off the Soulâand light and elevateâ And link it unto dreams of loftier birth Than any that belong to this chill Earth! For oh! can we with watchful ardour gaze On this enchanted and enchanting maze (A maze of Beauties and of wonders rare, But not without a plan profound and fairâ So that the different features of the Scene One Unity harmonious and serene With all their various hues of change compose, And smoothly fair the View consistent showsâ So that these scattered splendours mingling bright Form fixed Configurations of Delight!â) Can we indeed with careful gaze look down On this bright Prospectâsweetly made our ownâ Nor feelâthrough all our thrilled Existence feel The more than Knowledge which such scenes reveal, And rapturously acknowledgeâdoubting not The hallowed Admonitions of the Spot, And say unto ourselves with prayer-stilled voice, âRejoice, my Soul!âawake thee to rejoice!â Yea! such proud Scenes in tones o'erpow'ring speak (To those that love Instruction's hintsâand seek) With all their triumphs of surpassing show, Their fine free harmoniesâaboveâbelowâ Of dread Omnipotence on Nature's Throneâ Yet not of dread Omnipotence Alone!â Of perfect Wisdomâthat can have no bound Of Judgements strong, infallible, profoundâ Of Mercy, and of Goodness, and of Loveâ Such as alone can have their source Aboveâ Since here they have no likenessâhere no match On this dark Earth, where Sinners weep and watch!â Oh! Thouâwhose Heavenly and Omnific hand Formed these fine Scenes, and fashioned this fair Land, Arched these rich Skies, and armed them with all hues, Their warm vermilions, and celestial blues, And made them shine in beauty through all hours With varying Glory of Still-conquering Powersâ And reared these lovely Hills in graceful pride Above the azured chrystal of the Tideâ And spread these gilded and transparent Seas, And wrought yet myriad wonders fair as these. Oh! Thouâfrom whom all gifts of Good arise, 'Tis Thou that art Beneficent as Wiseâ Almighty as Beneficentâand Just As thou'rt Almightyâworthiest of all trust, Deserving of all homage and all zeal, Each throb of Gratitude the heart can feelâ Each strain of Adoration it can raiseâ Each glow of Pietyâeach gush of Praiseâ Thy mighty Works are telling still of Thee, And the great Heavens are lightening up the Seaâ Ten thousand blazing truths have they impressed On the broad tablet of its beamy breast, And from its depths, its billows, and its springs, That Sea responds with countless glorious things, The Hills unto the Plains unceasing cry, And the glad Plains with punctual zeal reply. The breezes whisper to the listening flowersâ The floating dews give warning to the bowersâ Till all the encircling and enkindled Space Which thought can travel, or the eye embrace, Is as a radiant temple without boundâ And thy great Works thy Worshippers are found, A Congregation of the Faithful met To pour the praise they never shall forget, A Congregation without spot or stain, To laud the Eternal King and bless His reign! No schismsâno doubtsâno wandering flights are thereâ The Atmosphere is all one breathless prayerâ Their hallowed Energies are still unspent, And still to one deep service they are bent!â And shall a wanderer, shall a stranger come, And pass the doorsâand press beneath the Domeâ Cold, dumb, and uninspiredâwhere all proclaim The living thunders of the Eternal Nameâ Move listlessly along the Holy Ground, Nor heed the sweetly solemn rites around, Amongst those Worshippers the only thing Untouchedâunwakenedâand unworshipping? And must that Wanderer and that Stranger beâ Of All thy Worksâthe one most blessed by Theeâ The one the most indebted to thy Graceâ Even Man, most bound to seek his Maker's face, Crown'd with thy Love, instructed by thy Word, And made thy proud Creation's mighty Lord. Bright glows the Sunâthe Sun of ruddy Morn, These scenes of boundless Beauty to adornâ The waves of other Seas may toss and hiss, But only sing and smile the waves of this!â The clouds of other Skies dark signs unfold, But these glow, steeped in purple and in goldâ The weeds of other Lands, uncouth and wild, May by the path in tangled knots lie piled, But even the very weeds of this are bright, And chain the ravished Sense, and charm the Sightâ The gales of other Airs may roughly blow, And shake the troubled foliage to and fro, But these still softly 'midst the flushed boughs wind, And shed abroad the scents which there they find, But these still gently 'mid the flower-beds wake, And but the incense from their sweet leaves shake. The hours of other climes may harshly change, But these still bring delights as sweet as strange. Morn, Noon, and Even, and the star-gemm'd Night, Vie with each other in their glorious flight! And now while brightly glows the Morning ray, How shines and smiles the Sun-enamoured Bay, Like an embodied flood of golden Day! Aye! here no roughened breakers foam on high, And hurl back threatenings at the threatening Sky; No angry surges that resounding sweep, Make one wide scene of terror of the Deep, The breakers, and the surges, and the foam, Which cloud tumultuous tides with wrath and gloom, These Waters of Enchantment may not know, So smooth and shining in their equal flow, The maddening Whirlwind and the darkening Storm, Which other Seas so hideously deform, Surely shall still be charmed away from theseâ Thus gently courted by the amorous breeze, Thus brightly painted by the admiring Sun, From earliest dawn, till his proud course is done. Yea! other Seas may frown and chafeâbut this 'Tis buried in too deep and full a bliss! Too bright the Heavens it hath to mirror back, Too sweet the airs that its clear surface track, Too warmly sheltering are the Hills that stand Round these glad shoresâa watchful guardian band, Those Hillsânot haughty as their brethren are, That pile their snows against the whitened star, But of a milder rise of gradual slope Than those high soaring towards Heaven's radiant copeâ And of a gentler and less proud ascent, More meekly reared beneath the Firmament, As though at first ambitiously they rose To leave their fair Earth in its green repose, And then repented them and stopped midwayâ Won by the beauties round in proud displayâ And sunk half back upon their Mother's lap, Which flowery folds and verdurous shades enwrap! Oh! what a Paradise of Wonders asks The Eye and Soul!âOh! how the Spirit basks In rapturous Admiration 'mid this wealth Of Loveliness, that seems to infuse new health, New vigour now throughout Existence' whole, And make each pulse a sense, each sense a Soul! Most lofty and most pure, and most unblaimed, The Admiration thus by Nature claimed In all her Gloryâand not claimed Alone, For her sole Selfâbut for a Mightier One! Heavens of outshining SplendourâSeas of Lightâ Islands of BeautyâMountains of fair heightâ Vineyards of rich luxurianceâAirs of balmâ Shores of ambrosial peace and dreamy calmâ And fields of teeming culture!âye conspire To enchantâto o'erpowerâto teach us how to admire! Well may ye lead the quick aspiring Mind, Fresh as the day-springâfree as the arrowy Windâ From strength to strengthâfrom tow'ring thought to thought, Till to the Heights of Contemplation brought!â Well may ye kindle every glorious dream, And teach the Soul victorious truths Supreme Untilâby ye first challenged and first charmed, First touched and thrilled, first wakened and first warmed, At length 'tis raised by Rapture and by Love, Ev'n your bright Excellencies far above, And darts away upon its franchised wings, High, high o'er temporal and terrestrial things, And leaves e'en your transcendant forms behind, While the unwearied and uplifted mind Soars far o'er Earth its miseries and its jars, To mix with Heaven's crown'd Seraphs and its Stars, And back at last in rapturous mood returns, (While fervently with unquenched zeal it burns!) To lend a thousand thousand glories more, To yeâye scenesâthat wakened it to adore! QUEEN JOANNA'S RUINED PALACE AT NAPLES. Fair walls, in ruins rising o'er the tide, Dismantledâbut with something of the pride Of other daysâye start from out the wave That threatens to become your shining grave, As might some Palace of the Ocean King, Built by the Sea-Powersâand those shapes that fling Bright Sea-flower-wreaths upon their locks of green, So stand'st thouâhanging o'er the Watery Scene. But then thou art in ruins!âdull Decay Is sternly mouldering stone by stone away, And that at once to mind profoundly brings A heavy thought of fragile Human things, That tell too plainly the old common tale Of fleeting works upreared by hands as frail! The Sunset streams through the dim fractured frames O' the ruinous windows like quick-rushing flames, With all its ruddy showers and kindling lights, Whose crimsoned glow the sense too keenly smites, Like Banners of Imperial Victory, Like mantles of emblazoned Regality, Those clear and coloured splendours richly stream, And sparkling break and brighten, beam by beam, Like glittering, quivering, and resplendent waves, Forth issuing from the shades of frowning caves, Like lamps outshining in a solemn tomb, (By contrast so redoubling its dun gloom,) Like chrystals in a cavern deep and dark, Which glisten brightly till we scarce can mark Their shapeâstill shifting as a subterfugeâ Like shining lightnings amid cloud-wreaths huge! Like gilded arrows stored in quivers old, Like glowing Sunflowers set in dusky mould; Like radiant jewels shrined in casket dim, Like bubbles sparkling o'er some dark cup's brim; Like ambered sheaves in shadowy places piled, Like sparkling swords in rent sheaths' dust defiled, They charm and rivet the half dazzled sight, Like meteors 'mid the Solemn Shades of Night; Or while they weave their beams in glittering wreath, Like young fresh smiles upon the face of Death! The ruined Palace still adorns the Scene, But where is the enthroned and worshipp'd Queen? These mouldering Walls some show of pride retain, But where is sheâwith all her courtly train! Goneâwith her pompsâher passions and her woesâ Gone with the extinguished Starâthe withered rose, The perished rainbowâand the vanished dew, And the winged breeze that once exulting blew! Joanna! I have seen thy pictured face, All bright with beauty and poetic grace. And I have read thy deep and clouded tale, And fain o'er both would draw Oblivion's veil; For the Annals fraught with darkening Mystery, But little with that lovely face agree; And that sweet faceâby contrast, shadows more A story that was all too dark before! INDIAN SONG OF FESTIVAL. 'Tis an Indian hour of Jubilee, Let the glad and the lovely assembled be! Come forthâall ye children of Beauty now, With glittering gems upon bosom and brow, Come with Coronals and with Carkanets, While the Day God over our dimm'd World sets. Those Carkanets and those Coronals Shall deck this fairest of Festivals! How the jewels wreathed round the Maiden's brows Illume their soft sheen with their coloured glows; How the gems clasped over her gentle heart With a fitful lustre, now heave and start To a keener radianceânow softly fade, As though faintly touched by a tender shade. 'Tis that every hue and that every ray, Responds to her innocent pulse's play! And in delicate language, mystic and sweet, The quivering gems their rich story repeat, And with every sparkle and tremour tell How those pulses sink, or those pulses swell. Lamps are gleaming o'er bower and o'er bannered bark, O'er bamboo-work tower and flower-filled ark, While the Dusk is now melting fast into the Dark. Come forthâOh! ye Children of India's Sun, Doth the gong not your wakening Senses stun? Tromp and cymbal announce too the revelry. Come forth!âcome ye forth to the Jubilee, 'Tis the first sweet Hour of a festal Nightâ Who would fly from Pleasure, and frown on Delight? THE SONG OF THE WANDERING TROUBADOUR. List ye unto my Minstrelsieâ A Warrior Troubadour, A Child of Song and Chivalry, Wanderer o'er Sea and Shore! Oh! I have been where turbanned throng Of the East's Beauties daze the eye! Where days all Sun, and nights all Song, Make LifeâFestivity! There, in the cool Chenaur tree groves, Nightingales die on their own notesâ Die for their bright and blushing Loves, The Rose. With the sweet sounds in their throats! There, dark-eyed Hourii breathe through flowers Their Soulsâall Love and Lightâ Fair as those blossoms of the Bowers, And Beautiful and Bright! So Beautifulâso Bright, are they, That the rich Rose is shamed, With all her pomp of proud array, The flower of flowers most famed! The Sovereignâthe Sultana Roseâ Whose State is all her ownâ A Queen with Heaven-anointed brows, Self-dowered with Globe and Crown. List all unto my roundelay, Each Country and each Clime, That laughs out to the light of day, Hath heard my rondeau-rhyme. I know thy splendid CourtâAllemaine! Full courtly dames smile there With the diamond coil, and the red gold chain, Wreathe they Stomachere and hair! In far-famed fair romantic Spain I have chaunted wonderous charms, And on its stormy Battle-plain Sung forth of War's alarms. Nor sung aloneâbut with good sword Dug my ensanguined way Where belted Knight and armoured Lord Have pressed the Empurpled Clay. List, Gallants!âto my Minstrelsies, I have traversed many a clime, And passed through far and fair Countries With roundelay and rhyme! And last the Troubadour hath come From gay and glowing Franceâ Where all is mirth, and light, and bloomâ The feastâthe songâthe dance. And last the Troubadour hath come From gay France, o'er the Seaâ But joy be thineâmine Island-Home! None dear as thou can be! Not Turkey-Land, nor proud Allemaine, Nor any Sun-kissed Coastâ Not vine-clad France, nor Spanish plain, Charms like thy charms can boast! List, list ye to my Minstrelsies!â Thus, girdled by the wave, And severed far and wide from these, None boasts of Sons so brave! Now list all to my fervent lay! Though warmer, lovelier Skies, And Suns of clearer, brighter ray, And bowers of richer dyes. Though sweeter dews, and softer days, And gales of tenderer air, May win for those far Lands more praise, None boast of Maids so fairâ None boasts of Daughters fair as thine, Proud Empire of the Wave! And all unmatchedâunpeered they shineâ Thy Beautifulâthy Brave! THE WANDERER'S RETURN. Ispahan! do I breathe thy spiced Zephyrs once more? Long, long, have I wandered o'er far foreign shore, But again through thy fields paved with Jonquilles I roam, And I claim thee my Cityâmy Countryâmy Home! Ispahan!â'tis with tears that I hail thee and greet, Yet with songs in my heart and with wings on my feet; For the present is joy, while the past perished years Wake the sadness of sighsâand the trouble of tears. Thus with softened dejection and tempered delight, I hail thee once moreâever glorious and brightâ And again through thy sweet Jonquille-fields though I tread, For my Brethren I weepâah! I weep for my Dead. I must mournâI must moan o'er the turbanned death-stone, And give deep thoughts to ties that are frittered and flownâ Yet, my fair Ispahan! thou art not the less dear, Since the Dead, not the Living, are all I love here. In my young golden days of delight and of love, My haunt was the glowing Pomegranate-lined grove, Where the Bulbul sings still in the Sun-brightened day, Though at night to the Cypress he wingeth his way! Ah! 'tis thus in Life's weary and desolate night, That we turn from the paths whose twined shades ev'n were bright, And bend our lone footsteps in deep pondering mood To the sunless, and scentless, and dark-shadowing Wood. To the Wood where the Death-trees, the Cypresses frown, Where the graves of our friends make us think of our own; And lone in the Shadow of Memory we dwell, And to Life's young delights bid a mournful farewell. Yet though thus solemn thoughts in my bosom will rise, And bring sighs to my lipâand a tear to mine eyesâ Those fond sighs they are stingless, those tears they are sweet, I have songs in my heartâI have wings on my feet. 'Twill be joyâ'twill be joy, each familiar old place With the yearnings of unchanged affection to trace, And to rest these tired eyes upon objects well-known, And call back all the years and the hopes that are flown. 'Twill be joyâ'twill be joy, to these scenes to return, And the long-unconned lessons of love to relearn! To relume each warm feelingârelink each sweet tie, And behold all the things most beloved ere I die! Though those feelings be fadedâthese ties may be torn, Yet still Memory's dear magic shall cheer the forlornâ So the dimmed shall be clearedâand the broken renewedâ And at one glorious Vision, the whole Past reviewed! But the things most beloved, shall I see them indeedâ Shall they rise to my callâshall they come at my need? Ah! the things most belovedâand regretted the mostâ Are the things that for ever are vanished and lost. Yes! the bower and the path still the same may remain, But the friends of my youth, what shall bring them again? Can even Memory restore themâthe scatteredâthe flownâ Can even Memory now make them once more all my own? Or if their dim forms for a moment she bringâ In a moment they are goneâon too swift-rushing wingâ Nor can fond prayers arrest them, nor wild plaints detain, And the pleasure is lost in the cold-crushing pain. Oh, Hope! I have known thee and found thee a reedâ And 'tis well from thy dangerous delights to be freed; But for Memory, sweet Memoryâit is but a glass, And the forms it reflects, all too rapidly pass. There bright images tracedâfor a while may appear To the Lifeâto the Truthâsoft, harmonious, and clear; But like clouds from the Spring-skies they vanish, alas! Ah! if Hope's but a reedâMemory! thou'rt but a glass! Thus, ye Silentâye Sleepingâmy thoughts turn to ye, Who lie hid beneath Death-stone and solemn Death-tree! Whose hearts (altered hearts!) have forgotten to beat At the approach of their loved Friend's swift hastening feet. Forgotten by them are those glad glowing hours, When together we met in our Kiosques and Bowers; Clustered flowers mark the feet, and carved turbans the head, For my Dear Ones I weepâAh! I weep for my Dead! Forgottenâforgottenâare all that they loved!â Lo! how can they lie there, so untouched and unmoved? How can they lie there, thus unfeeling and cold, When their loved friend rejoins them, the cherished of old? They are banished for everâand darkly are laid In the deep wormy pitâin the stillness and shadeâ And the Dead have no holdâand the Dead have no home, Save on my changeless bosomâsave in the grave's gloom. My brethrenâmy comradesâstill, still must I love, Your remembrance no change and no chance shall remove From a lone, world-worn heart that loves ye laid in death, Oh! far better than All that have Being and Breath. And thouâmy Nouzhetos!âlike winged Perii fair, Thou art still at my heartâstill thy deep home is there, Though I know thy dark eyes have lost all their glad light, That thy beauties are Nothingâthy dwelling isâNight! Mine own sweet Native Landâthou art dear unto me, Though the Shadow of all thou wert once wont to be, Though a charm is for ever withdrawn from thee now, And a change in thine aspect I sorrowing avow! Oh! how glorious thou wert in Youth's free tearless eyes, When Earth seemed the reflection of Sun-lighted Skies! Oh! how worshipped thou wert by this wild bounding Heart, And still glorious my Country, still blessed thou Art! But to eyes that have once known the dimness of tears, No scene shines so bright but some shade there appears; But to hearts that have once felt the sharp stings of Care, Wheresoever is LoveâSorrow's cloud too is there! My Brethren! the joy and the pride of my Soul!â Shadows, Night-born from Morn's mighty Rising may roll, But the Shadows of Death are eternal on Earth, YeaâDepartedâye have darkened my threshold and hearth. And with Ye half the sweet light seems banished of Day, Ye have borne with Ye half Life's dear blessings away; Though that light and those blessings fall not to your share, For you know them not, seek them not, need them notâthere. They are lost to the Deadâto the Living they are lostâ And alas! 'tis the Living must mourn them the most!â And for meâevery Scene that was loveliest of yore, Must more deepen the strife in my heart's wounded core. Yetâye sweet Jonquille-fieldsâand ye Pomegranate bowers, That have touches, and traces, and tones of past hours, Tho' no more ye may hold Earth's bright Hopes to mine Eyes, Breathe ye shouldâbreathe ye shallâof hopes shrined in the skies. For in Bowers far more lovelyâin fields far more bright, All o'erflowing with raptureâmagnific with light, With all blessingsâcharmsâtransportsâfor souls, hearts, and eyes, Shall I meet with my Deadâwhere Death cannot disguise! Then, ye bright Jonquille-fields and ye Pomegranate groves, Once the scenes of my Joys and the haunts of my Loves, Tho' Grief's heavy remembrance your sweet prospect mars, Breathe ye mayâbreathe ye doâof Hopes shrined 'mid the Stars! Ye remind me of prospects that yet shall unfold To the eye of my Soulâin resplendence unrolledâ The sublime golden mounts, and the starry-flowered plains, And the Bowers where the Sunshine that fadeth not reigns! There shall spread forth the Landscapes, still cloudless and bright, All ecstatic of transportâprolific of light, With all joys, pomps, and triumphs for sense, souls and hearts, Where the bloom ne'er decaysâwhence the bliss ne'er departs. Ispahan! oh, thy child hath returned to thy climeâ A weak war-beaten Wandererâthe toy of old Time; And again through thy bright Jonquille-fields though I tread, For my Brethren I weepâoh! I weep for my Dead. I weepâyes! I weepâyet 'tis strange that the while My flushed lip is upwreathed by a fond lingering smile, And my charmed senses kindleâmy cheered pulses beatâ I have songs in my heartâI have wings on my feet. A MOUNTAINOUS VIEW. 'Twas a Scene of dark terrorsâwild graces commixed! Of a rugged, yet Regal Magnificence tooâ And the eye of the Traveller at once was transfixed By the noble and exquisite charms of the view. There steeply arose the bleak broad-frowning hills, Uplifting their heads to the roof of the skiesâ 'Midst the cloudsâ'midst the starsâ'midst the storms and the chills, Amongst Evening's grey shadows, or Morn's purple dyes. And the Scene was not wanting in fair fertile spots, All arrayed in the beauty and gladness of smiles, So laugh 'mid the Desert the green grassy plots, So bloom in the Ocean the bright bowery isles. But those bleak rocky hillsâhung o'er fount and o'er grove, Those Giants of Graniteâthose strong Sombre Powers, Were like Life's sternest Ills rising steeply above The charm and the bloom of its best happiest hours. Aye! our Sorrows are Mountains! each Grief threatening swells, Like those walls and dread gates that round Paradise lowered, While our joys are like sweet sunken sunny-flushed dells, Too oft by their terrible neighbours o'erpowered! Still our Sorrows are Mountains that ruggedly rise To oppress all around them with far stretching shade, Like these dark Hills that now are displayed to mine eyesâ In their cold frowning barrenness sternly displayed. And yet to these Hills we may well think 'tis given, By the first and the last of the Sun to be crowned, And though bared to the blast, they are the nearer to Heaven Thus they shield all that's fairer, but frailer around. So in Life too, perchance, even the worst Forms of Ill May thus soar to the Sunlightâthe first and the last, And in stern savage Grandeur may shield the Soul still, Though it seem by the Strength of their Shadows o'ercast. There are Tempests more dire than those Shadows can be, With a thousand foul mischiefs that fearfully teem! While the bolt and the blast are winged fiercely and free, And dark dangers crowd thick as in Fever's wild dream. There's a fatal Fertility worseâoh! far worse Than the bare destitution, the bleakness, the dearthâ 'Tis a splendid destruction, an exquisite curse, From which Evils unnamed and unnumbered have birth! The fierce Storms of the Passionsâthe Tempests of Thought, Impetuous and chainlessâthat know not reposeâ With distraction aboundingâwith deep horrors fraught, These are worse than the shadowy oppression of woes. The dark fruitfulness gendering a host of vain thingsâ Proud Prosperity's childrenâthat spring up unchecked, Where the poisonous weed by the perfum'd flower springsâ This is worse than the waste by no lovely blooms decked. And our Sorrowsâlike Mountains though broad shades they throw, May ward off these wild tempests and shocks from the Soul, Our Passionsâour Thoughts may be tempered by Woe, And the storms overhead may less fatally roll. And these Mountain-like Sorrows may spread all around A calm temperate climateânot scorched like the wild; There no growths of redundance impure may abound, Stained and foulâby their own rank luxuriance defiled! Thus our Sorrowsâlike Mountains tho' rugged and bare, May yet cause a fertility glorious and pure; Blessed streams may flow thence, fresh and sparkling and fair, And a Harvest of stainless luxuriance ensure! Oh! our Sorrowsâlike Mountains may radiantly win Heavenly Sun-gifts to gild them and proudly to crownâ Those Sun-gifts undimmed by the low mists of sinâ That bright from their Source come triumphantly down! Then still let those Stern Forms in supremacy rise, And uprear their dread masses abrupt and immense, Like huge Giant Steps from the Earth to the Skiesâ They may yet prove our Shelterâour Strengthâour Defence! A CHINESE LOVE SONG. Oh! bright Yeang-tcheou!âOh! thou radiant one, With the lustrous, and loving, and almond-shaped eyes, 'Midst the depths of whose darkness there reigneth a Sun More Royal than that which hath Rule in the Skies. Now while wandering lone 'mongst thy columned halls, Where coloured lamps and rich vases outshineâ Or by shadowing trees and by bright waterfallsâ O speak! have I one thoughtânay, all thoughts of thine? Say! weepest thou beside those clear founts, mine own! Which free through thy Father's proud gardens play, Whilst I, where Caucasia's mountains frown, In unceasing grief pine my life away? Could thy Sire but my desolate Spirit behold, His haughty heart might be softened at last; Too ruggedly stern, and too rigidly cold, Through the long-lamented and bitter Past! Ah! why did he stamp my dark sorrowful doom, And make me a wandererâa wretch on the Earth? Because that I bear not the Peacock's proud plume, Nor boast the wrought breast-badge of rank and of birth? Because the stained ball I am forbidden to bear, And the costly pearl beads that high station proclaimâ Because these proud honours fall not to my share, And that low is my classâundistinguished my name? And yet tho' our dread Monarch ne'er raised me thus high, Nor sunned my poor fortunes with favours so rare, I will bless him, revere him, and serve till I die, With my leal heart of loveâmy doom'd heart of despair! And though thus unadvanced by our Sovereign's rich grace, Though poor my estate, and depressed my degree, My mind is not sordidâmy soul is not base, But even lofty as lovingâbold, faithful, and free! That proud Spirit no sorrow could wholly o'erwhelm, To my shoulders the far-streaming war-flag I slung, Hung high the dyed horse-hair, spear-fixed to my helm, And mingled the Host of armed Warriors among. Manyâmany have sunk down in death while I stoodâ Oft that flag hath waved free o'er the wild battle fieldâ Oft my red-fluttering plume hath grown redder with bloodâ The foe shrunk from the monster that scowled from my shield. And yet why do I liveâAh! why, why am I spared, Since I live to repine, and exist to regret? While my heart to the Vulture of Anguish lies bared, While the Star of my hope and my gladness is set! Oh! Being most radiantâmost beauteous, most fair, As if like the Air-flowerâthe precious and bright, Thou but livedst all on the Light and the Airâ Oh! alone on the delicate Air and the Light! Oh! thou Child of a high and a haughty birth, Our fortunes seem severed for ever to be; Yet still while I breathe on this desolate Earth My Life is my Country'sâmy Soul is for thee. Young, bright Yeang-tcheou!âOh! mine earliest Love, Thou peerless Chinese with the almond-shaped eyes! When my deep heart Death's fiery pang must prove, 'Tis for Glory and Thee that thy Lover dies! Oh! bright Yeang-tcheou!âOh! thou radiant one, Full of lustre and love are thy soft sleepy eyesâ In the depths of those dark eyes there reigneth a Sun More Royal than that which hath Rule in the Skies! AN EASTERN NIGHT. (ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN THE KEEPSAKE.) Here the manguasteens swellâthe magnolias bloom, Chenaur-tree, banana and palm, shield Earth's flowers; The tired musk-deer lie stretched 'neath the gum-tree's sweet gloom, The rich Paradise-birds wing their way to the bowers! The sweet winds whispering breathe while the faint twilight fades, And the fire-flies are gleaming like gems thro' the trees, And the humming birds'hues, shine like stars thro' the shades, As they float to their cinnamon nests on the breeze! Flowers filled with all odours now scent the rich airs, Where aloes, annanas, and orange-trees blow; The fierce forest-kings slumber sound in their lairs, Heaven above mirrored seems by a Heaven below. Bright glow the champaka The golden-coloured Champac flowers. and pomegranate flowers, Like stars that have fallen to Earth with a blush! And the wild bulbul's strains are prolonged thro' these hours, Till the zephyr streams by one rich musical gush! Oh! how this deep beautiful music of night Is stirring up echoes like spirits aroundâ Till the starsâthose great, glorious Creations of Lightâ Are listening like lovers to love's tenderest sound. 'Tis the time when blown roses commence their sweet reign, 'Tis the time when dew-diamonds light palm and pine bough, 'Tis the time when the Moon seems to weep o'er the Main, Tears trembling with light, while Heaven's crown wreathes her brow. 'Tis the time when the Love-God, the arch Manmadin, The Indian Cupid. Fills the air with his arrows, his soul searching darts, When the Moon through the Heavens doth her bright course begin, Straight this God begins his, through young passionate hearts! 'Tis the time for sweet thoughtsâall seems thinking around, The stars float in the skies like deep warm reveries; Nature seems e'en to shrink from a ray or a sound, Silence broods o'er the groves, heavens, savannahs, and seas. 'Tis a beautiful Night!âOh! the Sun hath bequeathed To the Moon his Sultana, all, all, but his blaze; His Life, Being and Soul he hath burned in and breathed Through the hush of an hour that requires not his rays. Oh! we hailed him with joy on his mighty noon-throne, While the World, like his Worshipper, blush'd at his gaze, And he trod through the Firmaments, lofty and lone, Till all seemed to be lost in the burst of his blaze. Oh! we worshipped him thenâand we worship him nowâ 'Tis his Spirit walks Earth in the reign of this Night; Our eyes saw his Noon-pompâDay's Crown on his brow, Now our Souls feel his Soul's flame, its strength, and its light. 'Neath this shadowy Bannyan's green Forest of Bowers, How sweet thus to commune with Nature and Nightâ To pass in such place the Stars' exquisite hours, Where those very Stars seem more o'erwhelmingly bright. The flamingoe hath folded the fires of his wings, Their crimsoning shadows no more flush the fountain, He is gone to his rest like all beautiful things, Save the Stars and the Moon, with her throne on Night's Mountain. That Mountain of Darkness which still seems to rise While our straining orbs strive to pierce Space with their gaze, Yet reach but their glorious boundariesâthe Skiesâ Oh! one Night of Beauty! thou art worth endless days. My heart now feels dying off into the Past With its faint broken musicâits Shadows, and Starsâ And I feel I could wish my dimmed Life but to last While this Night is thick-rolling her thousands of cars. REMEMBER ME! REMEMBER ME! (ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN THE KEEPSAKE.) When the sweet bulbul thrills the perfumed breeze, And crescent-crowned gleam those pomegranate trees, And thy Caique shoots through the slumbering Seas, Remember me! Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! When thou hast left this bright and blessed shore, Perhaps to breathe its heavenly airs no more, And home seems dearer than 'twas e'er before, Remember me! Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! When the last flash of daylight is declining, When Persian bowers are round thy head entwining, When Persian eyes are all about thee shining, Remember me! Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! When thou hast met with careless hearts and cold, Hearts that young love may touch, but never hold, Not changeless, like the loved and left of old, Remember me! Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! When this World's griefs shall come to cloud thy brow, When this World's smiles shall charm thee not as now, When LightâLifeâLoveâand all are dimmed below, Remember me! Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! When thy proud Soul its faults and follies mourns, And the altered heart in thy struck bosom burns, And Memory unto the pale Past returnsâ Then most, Oh! most, Remember me! I passionately pray of thee! ON THE LATE QUEEN OF PRUSSIA. Oh! thou! pale glorious Daughter of the Eagle! Thou Ermined Child of Empireâscarce of Earth, So bright of aspectâand of Soul so regal, More Royal in thy Death than in thy Birth! Thou stood'st sublimeâeven more and more exalted As Glory ebbed aroundâand Grandeur wanedâ Stood'stâwhen shocks Earthquake-like thy Realm assaulted To Earthâbut not to Circumstance enchained! Thou stood'st when Pomp decayed and Power departedâ When strength a Nation's Hosts and Councils leftâ Majesticalâthough bowedâthough broken-hearted, Imperial stillâthough baffledâand bereft. The Summer-sunbursts of thy blush are vanished, The Summer-lighnings of thy Smile are fled, And thou, the Queen of sceptered Queens, art banished Unto the funeral mansions of the Dead. But though the Sunbursts of that Blush are faded, And though the Lightnings of that Smile are past, The Martyr's palms with Beauty's myrtles braidedâ These wreathe a crown that even on Earth shall last! The Martyr's palms with Beauty's myrtles twining, These shall not droopâthough Empire's pride departs! And these thy radiant Memory streams enshrining How holily within our deepest hearts! SONG. [Another hourâanother hour] Another hourâanother hour, And fixed had been my hapless fateâ Escape no more within my power, Nayâeven Retreat had been too late. Another wordâanother word, And heart were crushed, or sense were gone, 'Twere the last strain upon the chordâ The last drop on the out-worn Stone! Another lookâanother look, And power were passed, or life were lost! The weakness from my Soul I shook, And left thee when I loved thee most! Another thoughtâanother thought, And all, even now, were void and vainâ The work unwroughtâthe task untaught, And I thy veriest Slave again! THE LOVER'S DEBT. Blessings about thee ever be! Thou that hast brightly thus for me Unlocked a Joy-fount deep and free! 'Midst Visions of Delight I move, And seem to tread yon fields aboveâ I liveâI breatheâI love!âI love! Gentlest Creatress!âthou hast wrought For me a good surpassing thoughtâ Supplied a treasureâyet unsought! With passionate Gratitude I burnâ Fain would I seek and strive to learn To make thee some well-matched return. But howâoh, how can I repay A gift so richâso gloriousâsay? Is there indeed on Earth a way? Ah me! there can but be one fee Worthy to erase this debt to theeâ To teach thee ev'n as thou hast taught me! MY HEAVENLY COUNTRY. My Heavenly Country!â'tis to thee My thoughts now ever gladly flee! Far from the tumult and the toilâ The stormâthe shadowâand the soilâ Far from the trouble and the tears Of mortal yokes and mortal years, My Heavenly Country!âbright and fair, All Love and Peaceâand Light and Air, Oh! for thy raptures and thy restâ Thy hallowed calm so deepâso blest; Thy myriad Harps with thrilling tones, Angelic throngs and starry thrones; Thy golden citiesâglittering towersâ And never fading changeless Bowers. Oh! for thy long and cloudless days, The bliss that droops not nor decaysâ The unfaltering strengthâthe unfailing youth, The Lightâthe Certainty,âthe Truth! Oh! for thy shining chrystal streams, Thy blessed breezesâbrilliant beams; Those beams uncrossed by mist or cloud, Which mantling Night may never shroud. Oh! for thy Crowns and for thy Palms, Thy glorious breathingsâprecious balms All wounds to sootheâall hearts to heal, Which here the Soul is quick to feel. Oh! for the triumphâfor the tranceâ The glories crowding on the glance. And for thy Scions and thy Shootsâ Thy deathless growthsâthy flowers and fruits; Thy living fountsâthy swelling strainsâ Thy radiant pathsâthy dazzling plains. Oh! for thy visions and thy views, Thy roseate lights, thy rainbow hues, Thy pure and perfect atmosphere, Serene, and exquisite, and clear. Ah, for what Prospects do I pine? My Heavenly, Heavenly Countryâthine! Bless'd Prospects thoseânot dale nor wood Not of the mount nor of the flood, Not of the rock nor of the field, There things more glorious shine revealed. When shall they spread before my gaze, In all their pomp, in all their blaze; When shalt thou charm my longing ken, My Heavenly, Heavenly Countryâwhen? And bless this wrung and darkened Soul, Which then shall reach its radiant Goal! My Heavenly Country! 'tis to thee That I am fain, how fain, to flee, To rest me from a thousand woes, And win at last the bright Repose Which only can be known and found On thy divine and distant ground, For I confess that all things here Are doubt, and weariness, and fear, And disappointment and distrust, And chaff and clay, and dross and dust, And desolation and decay, And dark despondence and dismay; Privation, failure, and constraint, And wrongs, and sufferings, and complaint; Illusion and Infirmity, And Mockeries that for ever flee; And Insufficiency and dearth, And groundless trust and graceless mirth; And strife and grief, and change and gloom, Pursuing illsâimpending gloom; Disquietude and sharp distress, And bitterness and heaviness; Monotony and cheerless waste, And heartless hope and helpless haste; And yearnings vain and torturing cares, And respites brief and long despairs; And Slavery and Subjection vile, And woes, and wants, and tears, and toil; Deep trials and temptations dire, And vain expectance and desire; Yea, all doth seem thus void and vainâ Distraction to the heart and brain; Yea, all things here thus gloomy seem, And allâthe Shadow of a Dream! All, all but Pain and Vanity, Save theeâMy Heavenly Countryâthee! THE OLDEN TIMES. The olden Timesâthe olden Times, When lofty thoughts were not deemed crimes Nor folliesâglorious deeds! When Valour and when Honour strove To glorify Romance and love, And sow Fame's splendid seeds! The days of oldâthe days of old, When triumph decked the true and bold, And Earth pealed out their name, When haughty feats of proud Emprize Were done for Beauty's sovereign eyes, And brought not scoff nor blame. When Crowned Enthusiasm upreared Her Altars, and sublimely steered Her blazing way through Earth! While with the wild-fire speed of Thought The Nations the Inspiration caught, And mighty Dreams had birth! When the fair feeâthe appointed meed Was little thought of near the deed Which could itself reward! When one brave impulse nobly fired, One glorious instinctâkeen-inspired, The WarriorâLoverâBard. The days of oldâthe days of old, Like dust dispersedâlike embers cold, They shall revive no more! But oh! could they one token sendâ One splendid Inspiration lend, To ours those Days of Yore! How would each weak and worldly aim, Each senseless cause, each selfish claim, In their true light appear; And every poor and paltry Dream, Each narrow strife, each nameless scheme, Their own dark colours wear! The olden Timesâthe olden Times, When, through all regions and all climes A glorious Spirit moved! And men with generous dealing dealt, And proudly thought, and strongly feltâ Atchievedâbelievedâand loved! OH! THEY WHOSE LIFE. Oh! they whose life doth early close, 'Tis little, little that they lose! In losing this dark world beneath, 'Tis little that they lose by Death! Envyings, repinings, groans, and sighs, Doubts, vanities, infirmities; And blame, and wrong, and toils, and tears, And failing hopes and waning years! And heavy griefs and haunting cares, And faulterings, faintings, and despairs; Pangs, miseries, sufferings, and regretsâ The dream that mocksâthe light that sets. The whirlwind and the crushing shock, The contact with the treacherous rock; The livelong piecemeal mouldering there, The drop by dropâthat worst shall wear. Theseâthese things 'tis that they must lose, Whose measured Life doth early close, To whom its dark years are denied, And things yet worse than those beside. The snares of sinâthe cloudsâthe chainsâ The stings of conscience, and the stains; The deep temptations evermore, The fearful trialsâsharp and sore. Oh! littleâlittle 'tis they lose, Save pains and fears, and sins and woes, Who early are withdrawn by Death From this tempestuous World beneath. And yet around the grave we creep And weepâand wipe our eyesâand weep And sorrow o'er the bless'd, the freedâ We that are worms and dust indeed! HOPE. The drowning Seaman grasps the empty air Above him in its hopeless clearness spread, Clutches the wave with desperation thereâ Still strivingâstruggling onâtill he is dead. So Hope, when nought substantial meets its grasp, Strains any Shadow fleeting faintly by, Nor knoweth wholly to withdraw its clasp, Till sweeping Ruin saith, âDespair and Die!â THE FIRST VIOLET. Sweet flower!âand sweeter far to me Since that my childhood joyed in thee; A Beauty bathes thy beauteous head, From Youth's own years of gladness shed. Not yet are spread before our eyes The splendours of the vernal skies. But flower!âenchanted flower!âthrough thee All Spring at once hath come to me! A magic charm for me thou'st wrought, A world of sumless treasure broughtâ Thou hast wafted on thy perfumed wing At once the whole sweet wealth of Spring! Yea! thou hast given, in rich excess, At once Spring's whole deliciousness; And verdure laughs around, and bloom And freshness, splendour, and perfume. But, lovely flower, not all thine own The Preciousness about thee thrown, A light and odour bathes thy head, From years of long-lost rapture shed! TO THE VIOLET AT NAPLES. Sweet Violet! ever with fresh delights teeming, Deep, deep, 'midst the moss droops thy delicate head; Thou might'st seem like some lovely One slumbering and dreaming, And thy leaves still are folded, yet Morn blushes red. Morn blushes red o'er the vineyard and mountain, The grove and the garden, the shore and the sea, Enkindling the pathway, illuming the fountain, And painting the stems of the green leafing tree. Wake, Violet! wake! hath some fairy spell bound thee While all things are wakeningâwhile Morn blushes red, The sweet Orange-trees whitening and blossoming around thee, Hang their crown-wreaths of Silver and Pearl o'er thy head. Ah! Spring scarce seems Spring, Flower of Beauty! without thee, For what with thy breath and thy hue may compareâ Such an Atmosphere streams of Enchantments about thee, So rich is thy vesture, thy fragrance so rare. Art thou matched by the lilies in all their pure splendour, Or the roses that shine like the golden-winged hours? No! thy tint is more beauteous, thy scent is more tenderâ Thou art fairest and first of the fair train of flowers. Thou art dyed of one hue with the clear Heavens above thee, Where their blue is the richest, their glory most bright; This Earth seems to greet thee, those proud Heavens to love thee, Thou flower of all Beautyâthou flower of delight. Wert thou snatched from those skies by some mystic translation, Since thou seem'st like their own lovely offspring to be? Or, say, at the first hour of flowery creation, Did some Seraph's sweet eyes pour their blue light on thee? Like a Seraph's sweet eye thou art celestially shining, When all thy deep charms are disclosed to the view, And oh! in Spring's chaplet no flower is entwining So perfect as thouâever lovely and new. But flowerâdarling flower!âI will own that Affection Hath lent thee a charm which nought else could have given; I look on thee still with a fond predilection, Till my heart wears thy huesâand those hues are of Heaven! In the days of my childhood, the bright, the enchanted, I made thee my treasure, and joyed in thee still; I knew the dear spots by thy sweet breathings haunted, And felt, as I neared them, my heart bound and thrill! Oh! think with what fullness of innocence glowing Was the heart that could thrill at so slender a call, Which could prize that pure treasure of Nature's bestowing Beyond all Earth's pompsâits proud pageantries all. Oh! the hues that it wore must have been fair and shining, Let it wear them again thenâthe hues of that hourâ But, alas! the dark dyes of strife, sin, and repining, Have too deeply o'erclouded the heart's canker'd flower. Yet Memoryâthe Enchantressâthe Embracingâthe Enthralling, Can the dreams e'en of Innocence bring once again The pure hallowed feelings so sweetly recalling, That Sin seems exorcisedâand Sorrowâand Pain! THE FELON'S GRAVE. A FRAGMENT. It was a Felon's Graveâthe spot seemed drear, And something stern and chilling lowered aroundâ The dark and sombre Presence lingered near, A troubling Shadow lengthened o'er the ground. There reigned the mysteries of a withering awe, There ruled the horrors of a sickening fearâ These warned the heedless wanderer to withdraw,â These checked the pious offering of a tear! There spread no pensive peaceâwhereunto clings The Heart so oft beneath Life's changeful Skiesâ No solemn sense of high and holy things, No atmosphere of sweet Humanities! And yet although the spot seemed drear and wild, Some reconciling features marked the scene, Where Earth embosomed her frail, erring Child, And Nature shed her influences serene. That grave was roofed by the eternal Sky, 'Twas open to the Sun and to the Showerâ 'Tis true there rose no deck'd memorials nigh, There sprung up from the sod no tribute-flower. That Grave was roofed by the resplendent Sky! And Nature round displayed her pride and powerâ Creation's Grand Cathedral wide and high Rose o'er itâglorious through each changeful hour. That Grand Cathedral not by frail hands built, Whose chrystal walls have yet known no decay, Whose splendid Dome with living Suns is gilt, Whose lamp's the everlasting Torch of Day. Whose never-closing Gates lift up their heads, That through the King of Glory's Pomp may passâ Which o'er the Universe still streams and spreads The Eternal Pomp, which all things share and glass! Yes! in that Grand Cathedral 'twas enshrined, The grave of one so branded, and unblessed! The admiredâthe abhorredâthe good and guilty find Alike their last long Home in Earth's deep breast! Nature repulseth not with disrespect The meanest or the vilest of mankind; Maternal Earth may spurn not nor reject The veriest outcast to her arms consigned. The World without may cast no shade of blame On mortal Manâthe Living or the Deadâ Passive, Creation's universal frame, Whate'er the curse piled on the Culprit's head! The same reception waits the worst and best, Though widely different were the paths they trod; Earth frowns not on her helpless clay-cold Guest, But leaves him to his Judge and to his God! 'Twere well if Man himself thus acted too! All here is but perplexity and doubt!â He boasts he reads his brother's history through, And knows as little as that World without! The Actions and the Conduct he may scan, But ne'er their springs detectâtheir cause assign. Be strict, be rigorous to thyselfâOh! Man! But leave thy brother to his Judge andâthine! Canst thou his trials and temptations know, And pierce the inmost counsels of his breast? Can Skill or Science the veiled motives show, Canst thou adjust the scalesâapply the test? And if by Human laws condemned to pay The forfeit of his crime or of his fault, Should'st thou uncharitably then essay To magnify that faultâthat crime to exalt? No, no! let Human pity sorrowing draw The curtain then o'er criminal and crimeâ No longer subject unto Earthly law! No longer brought before the bar of Time! To dread Eternity's tribunal borne, There shall the Child of Earth his doom receiveâ And all Earth's children at the appointed morn Must there appearâwhere shall be no reprieve! Then doth not meek indulgence best become Poor erring mortals towards their fellow men? And most when frowns between the sacred tombâ Oh! surely most must it become them then! This rude, lorn Graveâwhich for its tenant's sake I shunned at first with shudd'rings scarce suppress'd, Not in itself was't such as should awake Dismay and horror in the stranger's breast! From mine own knowledge of the truth there sprung A gloomy feeling and a chilling aweâ A heavy cloud around its precincts hung, But nothing there to appal or shock I saw. The dreariment that darkly seemed to brood Around that spot from mine own thoughts arose, And took its colour from mine own sad mood, There was but quiet silence, and repose! And when with calmer gaze I looked around, New feelings soon those feelings chased away; A voice spoke from the green and dewy ground, And bade me yet a little while delay. Nature's immortal finger there did trace Deep solemn truths to touch and teach the heart; I felt her glorious Presence in the place, And stood in silence and in thought apartâ And stood in silence and in thought, and felt How holy Charity indeed is blestâ 'Tis well to feel the softened Spirit melt, And gently bow to Mercy's mild behest. The sickening fear with all its horrors passed, The withering awe with all its mysteries fled, No more I shrunk, bewildered and aghast, From that lone Presence-chamber of the Dead! Ev'n, as I said before, the Grave was shrined In such a lofty Temple and august, It could not fail at last to impress the mind With deep and hallowed feelingsâclear and just. 'Twas fair surrounded like some honoured Grave By many lovely and outshining things; There, roll'd uncheck'd the Sunset's golden waveâ There, fluttered Morn's empearled and rainbowed wings. 'Twas visited like Innocency's Tomb, By tenderest Ambassage of breeze and starâ 'Twas watched thro' dreamy Midnight's purple gloom By the pale Moonâborne high on rolling car. Yea! through the lonely Night's most lonely hours (When nought the scenery's solemn show can mar) 'Twas watchedâas though by deep mysterious powersâ By Moonlight paleâand Passion paler far! For there, one, sorrowing and deploring knelt, Who loved the lost one with a perfect love, No transient sentiment it was she feltâ In that alone could she liveâbreatheâand move. Daughter of Sorrows! mourner tried and trueâ Thy heavy anguish is as still, as deep, Though thy chang'd cheek presents Death's shadowy hue, Thou dost not murmur, and thou canst not weep. Thine is no pomp of woeâno laboured griefâ Oh, no! 'tis Nature's ownâand Nature's allâ It seeks no sympathyâasks no reliefâ Content to abide by its own crushing thrall! 'Tis Nature's all, in soothâand Nature's ownâ Even like this solemn Sanctuary of death, Where rose no carven monumental stone, Where hung no chiselled scrollâno sculptured wreath. Her Grief is even as her Love had been, Deep as her Lifeâand single as her Soul!â Silent as 'tis profoundâand calm as keenâ It is her being's allâher feelings whole! Sorrows there are, so buried in the breast, They prompt no sigh, and they permit no tear; The Soul by deadening ills is stunned to rest, There dwells no wild suspense, no watchful fear! They wrestle briefly with the inward storm, Whose anguish thus all words are vain to speakâ Misery then earthwards weighs the Heavenliest form, And plucks the young rose from the loveliest cheek. They wrestle briefly with the inward storm, Whose Souls must thus, with speechless suff'ring acheâ For ever gnawed by Grief's undying wormâ The Heart's core crushedâthe Heart shall quickly break! It was a Felon's graveâwhat did she there?â That gentle, stricken, uncomplaining thing? How could his death cause her young heart's despair, And blight her smiling Season's opening Spring? Who can reveal that pale young mourner's tale, There kneeling speechless in her hopeless woeâ Or what would such slight chronicle availâ The Heart's profounder History who can know? To us that tale might seem mysterious still Without the clue to guide us through its maze, And would perchance but with fresh wonder fill, Since the deep truth lies veiled from mortal gaze. That Heart's strange workings nothing may unfold, Strong Feeling's young beginnings none descry, Eternal shadows still round these are rolled, Eternal shadows round them darkening lie! To her perhaps the Culprit might have shown Alone his better natureâswayed by Loveâ His Spirit's bright and sunny side alone, For few or none in utter darkness move. On her he might with gentlest fondness smile, For her become the being that he seemed, Fewânone are hopelessly and wholly vileâ O'er darkest minds some softening rays have beam'd. Or she might still have hoped on to the lastâ That by such love as her's he must be movedâ Must be reclaimedâand weaned from that dark Pastâ Cease, Dreamer! she was Womanâand she loved! And Love was surely sent unto our Earth To be for all of Heaven a voice and signâ And oh! when once he springs to radiant birth, He cannot dieâev'n from that birth divine! THE GEORGIAN SULTANA. She was a Georgian!âfair, and sweet, and young, That strayed among the fountains and the flowers; Yet listless strayed those flowers and founts among, Though these adorned and graced the Imperial Bowers. The young Sultana, with a vacant air, Wandered 'mid those fair founts and fragrant flowers, As though her heart and feeling were not there, But even with far off scenes and bye past hours. Still the more curiousâthe more scarce and choice The growths around, the less that eye they won; At length she lifted up a languid voice And murmuring spoke, while still she wandered on. âYes, all is beautiful and glorious here, What can I ask or needâwhat more require? A smile of other days or even a tearâ A freer air in freedom to respire! âSince though where'er I turnâall proudly round A thousand splendid objects are descried, Old memories seem to start up from the ground And say, âthy heart is formed for Love, not Pride.â âSince though the Imperial Crown now binds my brow, And though my form in dazzling robes is drest, Though diamonds o'er my listless heart may glow, And rubies burn along my ermined vest, âI feel I loved light wreaths of Georgian flowers Wove round my thoughtless head in sweet old days, One little dewdrop hung in Georgian bowers, Better than jewelled crowns, with all their blaze! âOh! sweet affectionsâOh! enchanted dreamsâ Oh! glowing visionsâever bright and newâ Oh! bless'd delights, that past like meteor-gleamsâ Oh! deep and darling hopes, that smiled and flew! âWhere are ye all?âor whereâOh! where am I? I yet might find yeâin my own sweet Land; But hereâI nightly groanâI daily die!â But haunted by your memoriesâparted band!â 'Twas thus she wailed among the founts and flowers, And murmuring wanderedâwandered murmuring on!â A Voice of Grief in those delightful bowers, A very Shadow in that dazzling Sun! Well might'st thou mourn! thou Slave of a proud Fate! Young fettered Gazelle!âpoor imprisoned Dove!â To thy true heart how dull seemed pomp and state, For ever parted from thy Land of Love! Yet change that mournful mienâthat sorrowing strain, And join at length the lightsome, festive throng; Why should thy youthful days be vowed to pain? Why should'st thou drag a hopeless life along? No! deck that lovely form with curious art, With studious care and skill come forth arrayed, And learn to act the proud Sultana's part, Devote thy thoughts to pomp and to parade! Ah! wretched counsel!âcould'st thou alter soâ Wert it a prosperous changeâa happy cure? Oh! no! 'twere but another kind of woe, Less lovely, and less sacred, and less pure! Dull Vanity and Pride have their own pains, With nothing or to exalt them or redeem! At times at least thou scap'st thy galling chains, Winged on a thought, and wrapped within a Dream! But their's are chains that ever, ever bind, That cankering close round the corroded breast, And rust themselves into the tainted mindâ Oh! could'st thou changeâSay! would'st thou thus be blest? SONG. [Oh! bright are the gems richly twined in thy hair] Oh! bright are the gems richly twined in thy hair, Like quick rays of light, wreath'd with clear threads of goldâ Scarce the eye may undazzled rest momently thereâ Oh! bright are those gems and those locks to behold! Yes! rich are the jewels that shine midst thy hair, And fair are the flowerets that laugh round thy brow; But thine eye dazzles deeper, thy cheek shows more fairâ Then what need of these foolish adornments hast thou? Oh! cast them away from theeâcast them away, Let the World see how little to them thou mayst owe; Let thy Lovers behold how in simplest array Thou surpassest divinely all beings below! Oh! rashâand unthinking! 'tis better by far We should deem that around thee some borrowed light's thrown! And think our proud Sun but a Glory-touched Star, Fed and lit with a splendour that is not its own! ON A PICTURE OF THE INFANT SAVIOUR. Was the hand not inspired that thus brightly could trace That pure Formâall a Heaven of deep Beauty and Love? Oh! that heavenliest Form, and that heavenliest Faceâ All the King and the Godâall the Child and the Dove! Oh! thou Beauteous Omnipotence! ne'er from this hour Be thine Image of Loveliness swept from my thoughtâ 'Tis all Majesty, Holiness, Mystery, and Powerâ To one Glory SupremeâBeatificalâwrought! Oh! thou Beauteous Omnipotence! ne'er from my mind Shall this Vision of Grace and of Power be effacedâ How mysteriously mixedâhow harmoniously twined Are the Might and the Meekness, there gloriously traced. And remembering this Form, can I ever forget That our God's chosen titleâall titles above, Writ in rays of the bright Sun that never shall set, Is the God of All Graceâand the God of All Love? A MEMORY'S MEMORY. Sweet Evening was hovering o'er hill and o'er vale, The Night's loveliest Sisterâsoft, shadowy, and pale, And gently and gradually won her mild way, And usurped the proud throne of the gay glaring day! And Nature was girt with a hush of repose, And still seemed new perfections and charms to disclose, While she lowered, by degrees, her rich sphere-jewelled veil, And bound on, her dark zoneâlit by dewy gems frail. Then were deepening all hues of the Earth and the Sky, Night-flower-odours were breathing through Zephyr's last sigh; And that last sigh was dying and dying away, Like the colouring of clouds which melts down with the day. In tranquillity every light leaf seemed to brood, In the green dewy hush of the hill-skirting wood, And the Darkness grew ever more dense and profound, And shed something of solemn sweet dreaminess round. One light Bark was on the blue far distant seaâ Even that seemed in enchanted quiescence to be, Like a Star on the breast of the Billows it shoneâ Oh! the Heavens had their thousandsâthe Seas had that one! Yet it charmed the quick eye from the others afar, For a sweet Human Feeling was linked with that Star. (Oh! how many a fond Heart, Love's long vigil might keep, Till that Star of its gladness gleamed out on the deep;â In its small sacred sphere what a priceless freight lies Of affections, and feelings, and dear hallowed ties. Oh! many a fond Heart might light Hope's kindling spark At the bright reappearance of that fragile bark, But the glory of Stars, in their regions above, May win awe, worship, homage, but not our Heart's Love!) The fair new-risen moon poured her young light around, And just yellowed the Horizonâjust silvered the ground, Then I mused on a moment long melted and gone, But that once like a moment of Paradise shownâ A moment when Life was divested of care, (When the deep Sphery Music of Heaven thrilled the air, And its pure Light Empyreal transcendantly played Through the Sunshine that brightly Creation arrayed, Yet was thrown by that clear Spirit-light into shade!) 'Twas when Joy and wild Hope were possessing my heart, 'Twas a moment too sure and too swift to depart, And to leave no sweet likeness nor relique behind, And yet then something seemed of that time to remind, Though how differentâand oh! how that difference was felt, For the heart in my bosom did sorrowingly melt, As I sadly contrasted the time that was fled With the pale actual Time that then flew o'er my head. Still that moment of Evening and Shadows became, To my deep sorrowing Heart, which no hopes could inflame, Strangely dear, with its soft gloom, beneath and above, 'Twas a moment to feelâ'twas a moment to love! All around was so peaceful, so breathless, so deep, 'Twas a moment to wish,â'twas a moment to weep; 'Twas a moment to suffer,âa moment to sighâ Oh! a moment to dream,âor a moment to die! For Life seem'd then like Nature, profoundly oppressed With a languor of silenceâa burthen of rest! And gentle and soft the transition had been To the cold dreamless sleep from the calm dreamy scene. And yet surely I do that deep moment some wrong, For to it did a force and a feeling belong Which made Life, if more hushed, more concentered and still, More like to the Life of free Spirit and Will! For it shook Earth's vile dust from its bright wings away, And was almost unconscious of chains and of clay; For it gathered its strength like a tempest its might, In that full brooding stillnessâin Silence and Night. And while Thought after Thought rose distinctly and clear, It felt its own Power, and it ruled its own Sphere. Oh! I wrong'd that deep momentâI did it much wrongâ It was full as 'twas calmâas 'twas silent 'twas strong; 'Twas a moment to think,âand a moment to trust, And a moment to fling down the fetters of dust; 'Twas a moment to give to the Pastâyet not grieve; 'Twas a moment to Loveâand a moment to Live. Since that time I have thought, I have felt, I have mourned, But, alas! such a moment hath never returned; Ne'er hath Memory my Spirit so witchingly bound, Nor exerted a sway so serene and profound; And if, then, I lamented and sorrowed in vain, O'er a moment of bliss that might ne'er come again, And if then with a lingering devotion I turned To a moment for which I so fervently yearnedâ Ah! since then but too oft have I fruitlessly longed For that time's sweet return which I slighted and wronged! And now, now, would I gladly be fettered once more By those bright links which Memory wove round my Heart's core. And though then that heart mourned o'er lost moments of bliss, Oh! that moment of Memory was bliss matched with this!â For her light wanes and sinks, and grows feeble and weak, And in vain for its past lovely brightness we seek. Yet I know few things brighter or fairer below Than that Memory's pale Memory, like moonlight on snow! Few things dearer I find in this dull World of care Than that Memory so faint, of a Memory so fair! And still amid Life's endless strife and loud stir, To that Dream of a flown Dream I fondly recur, And woo its wan images, clouded and changed, To the Heart from all other enjoyments estranged. Yes, I woo to my Heart,âby despondency bowed, That shade of a shade, and that cloud of a cloud; And it taketh the place, and it acteth the part Of a hope, and a charm, and a joy to that Heart; And its softness can soothe, and its witchery can win, From the bleak World without, and the blank World within; And it seems to my tearful and long-wearied sight Like a fair lovely vision of gentle delight; And it weareth the dyesâand it beareth the guise Of a happy illusion serene, to these eyes. Thusâthus as we farther and farther advance On Life's gloomy marchâwhile sweet forms that by chance Crossed our paths, to enchant and to gladden and cheer, Fade away to leave all things more dismal and drear.â Even at last we are taughtâoh! hard lesson and direâ While we view, spark by spark, smile by smile, thus expire, To cling as the wretch in the sinking wreck clings, To the things we ne'er trusted before, the frail things That but offer a longer continuance to woes That without their vain aid might more speedily close; And we wind the Heart's fibres round any faint dream, Lest that poor Heart should breakâhappiest doom we might deem!â When the true glowing joys it once knew are destroyed, And its Hope is a blank, and its World is a void; When its trust is betrayed, and its freshness is gone, And 'tis left on this cold Earth bereaved and alone; Then a Memory's pale Memory, with Shadows allied, Sufficeth the heart that disdained in its pride All that Life might desireâall that Youth should adore, All that Earth's wealth could furnish and proffer of yore. Ah! the rose, whose deep beauty the garden adorned, In its freshness and fulness of sweetness we scorned, But when hues, fragrance, brightness, and freshness depart, The pale, dull withered leaves we hoard up next our Heart. Thus, alas! the divinest of joys I have known, The divinest of moments, whose bliss was full blown, I scarce prized in possessionâscarce blessed on their flight, But even took as a tributeâreceived as a right, And but saw all their charms when for ever removed, Too estranged for enjoymentâtoo late to be loved. Yet the moments to Memory then fervently given, Had a glow and a bloomâsuch the clouds wear in Heaven When the deep mellow Sunset is flushing its face, And the Giant of Light doth repose from his race. Still I deemed I was wretched, and darkly complained Of the gloom and the sorrow around me that reigned; And I felt I was Grief's hapless Victim and Slave, And turned my dark thoughts to the Sleep of the Grave; And my Heart seemed to cry with a faint bitter cry, â'Tis a moment to dreamâand a moment to die!â But now, now I would gladly return to that time, For it shared the deep fervour of feeling's fresh prime, And while Fancy swift fluttered her many hued wings O'er the soft and the half-saddened aspect of things, And the Earth seemed a haunted and hallowed abode, By beloved apparitions thronged brightly and trod. I feltâoh! I feltâthough I owned it not then, A delight that I fear I may ne'er feel again! And 'tis now, I with grief and with fond shame confess That I then little knew of the truth of distress; And I feel that deep moment when Earth could appear Like a sweet haunted Regionâa love-hallowed Sphereâ And when Memory seemed almost as strong and as bright As Reality's fulnessâa Power and a Lightâ Aye! I feel that deep moment was happy and blessed, That 'twas such as would now be, like Rapture possessed!â That while Earth appeared linked to the calm Heaven above, 'Twas a moment to Liveâand a moment to Love! And to give to the days of the pastâyet not grieve, A sweet moment to Loveâa bright moment to Live! LOVE AND FREEDOM. 'Twas a warrior sheathed in shining arms, Equipped for the Battle's stern alarms, A Warrior Youth of the Sunbright East, With the lance in his handâthe mail on his breast. He mournfully leant, as in sorrowing mood, Beside a young Maidenâby anguish subdued, Whose quivering lip, and whose forehead pale, Told Love's story at onceâand her own sad tale! But the fire sprang sudden and fierce to his eyeâ He put on the frown, and he forced back the sigh, And he grasped his weapon with firmer hold, While he spoke in proud accents, far-thrilling and bold. âI go from the bowers of an ignoble rest, Now foremost in fight be my Egret crest; Ere noon hath faded, ere twilight's fallâ Haste!âbring me my banner and Atabal! âWe will never faulterâand never fly; We will greatly conquer or greatly die. Dost thou dare to weep, dost thou dare to show, HaidÃ©e!âthis passion of Woman's woe? âLet Pride in place of Affection spring, Or at least but forbear my Heart to wring! Wouldst thou see me a coward and traitor proveâ Oh! love me betterâor cease to love! âI have thought I loved theeânay, none shall say That I worshipped thee not by night and day; But my Love shall yet deeper and warmer be, When it burns in a Soul that is chainless and free! âFor oh! what is Love if it doth not spring From Earth to Heaven upon Liberty's wing: I call it not loving thee, dark-eyed HaidÃ©e, Till I love thee thusâwho can feel but the Free!â OH! HOW AT TIMES. Oh! how at times the reckless Heart Will bid each lingering Hope depart, And turn in harsh and angry mood, From every still remaining good. With stubborn agony it keeps Its vow, and its own Life-drops weeps; It strains to breakâit strives to dieâ In that stern, stubborn agony! SUNSHINE AND MOONLIGHT. Bright Virgin-Queen upon thine Opal Throne!â Sweet Conqueress of the Night!âwhose sable zone Is cast around thy soft and lovely Form, Thus proudly placed beyond the cloudâthe stormâ Beyond the reach of Earth-stain or of blight, As though by contrast with thy peerless light Only to make thee shine more fairly bright, Only to lend thee a more witching power To enhance thy charms in thy triumphant Hour. Bright Queen!âSweet Conqueress!âmany turn to thee When they would waken slumbering Memory, And fondly deem that thy pure hallowed ray Revealeth things that shun the glare of Day. Full many turn to thee, thou gentle Moon, And ask of thee a favour and a boonâ What time thy delicate and pearly beams Shine down upon the waves of quiet streams, Thy soft undazzling beams, that gently throw A dreamy radiance o'er all things belowâ With which long dallying those clear waves serene That wore Heaven's blueâor glassed their banks of green, Enamelled o'er with graceful wilding flowers, In the gay Sunshine's light and laughing hours, Shall change to silver sheen, and chrystal clear, And that Queen-Virgin's tintless livery wear. I crave not aid from theeâthou placid Moon! But worship at the shrine of fervent Noon! And most when glows the splendid Sky of Day I feel the solemn Past's deep silent swayâ Oh! 'tis beneath the golden, golden Sun My web of Memory is most richly spunâ Her aÃ«ry tapestries and clear tissues frail Are then best wroughtânor doth one fine thread fail; Her floating gossamers then charm my eyes, And catch a thousand glittering rainbowed dyes; And if they fluttering float 'twixt me and Heaven, By them a tenderer, purer, holier light seems given, Even to its lustrous arch and radiant dome, Where rose-tinged clouds like flowers of beauty bloom. 'Tis then to kindling Life around me start The forms most dear unto my eyes and heart, The forms beloved, admired, in other days, On whose cold dust the Earth now harshly weighs. Long have they absentâlong divided been, And oh! how welcome to Earth's softened scene. Far have they wanderedâlong in darkness strayed Through endless Wastes of Silence and of Shadeâ But thenâthey gathering round me brightly come, And call my wearied, wandering Spirit home; For ah! it is a wanderer too, and strays Full oft and long in far forbidden waysâ It too hath wanderedâand hath walked in gloom, Although on this side of the frowning tomb. But 'mid Life's various paths are some as drear, As full of shade, and mournfulness, and fear, As any that chill'd fancy can pourtray, Where the stern Grave yawns deep, and Death hath sway, My Spirit long hath darkly known to roam, And then it is that loved Ones call it home, And win it from the wildness and the waste, And the delusions vain it long hath chased. Yes! it hath been a restless wanderer too, And troublous mazes it hath travelled through, And tracked full many a rude and rugged path, And past o'er desert-wilds of howling wrathâ But then around, its lost Beloved Ones come, And claim it for their own, and call it Home, While that sweet Vision of familiar Forms Almost atones for Fate's worst, wildest storms. And oh! 'tis when shines forth the radiant Sun That Vision is beheldâthat Rapture won! 'Tis when the Beauty of his living rays O'er all the landscape in full glory plays, Those beams of splendour, that far glitt'ring shed A brightness on the lowliest weed's meek head, Upon the dreariest and least lovely spot!â Oh! wheresoe'er their sparkling smiles are shotâ The glorious, the supreme, the matchless Sun!â How proudly doth he rise his race to run, How brightly doth he shed his rich Light round, What time he touches on its measured bound. 'Tis when he flames in full effulgent pride That lovely Apparitions round me glideâ Beneath the dazzling splendour of his reign I hail the aÃ«ry Phantoms of the brain. Sunshine to me is hauntedâsoft and bright, Sweet Visions glance along the glancing light, And golden memories of old lovely hours Fill all my Soul among the noonlit bowers; Then 'tis I walk as in a circling cloud By feelingâlove and dear remembrance bowed; Then 'tis I calmly and serenely seem Wrapped in the deep enchantment of a dream. Yes! 'tis when Sunshine laughs o'er wood and plain, I court sweet Memory and her shadowy train; 'Tis when shines forth the golden, golden Sun, For me her web is ever fairest spun. Let others then thy silvery lustre blessâ Oh! Moonâand unto thee their prayer address, And ask thee for thy favour and thine aid When they would call from the deep Realms of Shade Some parted loved oneâsome lamented ghostâ Too long lamented, and too darkly lost. Let others lift to thee their suppliant eyes When on the air a brooding stillness lies, When not a sound of living gladness wakes, And not a smile o'er Nature's aspect breaks. But let me evermore devoutly turn, When richest Sunshine doth triumphant burn, To offer my deep homage to the Past, And court those Visions that must fade too fast. I ever blessed that bright victorious blaze!â Then Worlds of Magic opened on my gaze, Then Loved Ones were most lovedâHope shone more clear, Young Joy itself was fairer, and more dear, And every feeling more intensely glowed, Till all my Soul with passionate bliss o'erflowed; Therefore it is that now, through grief and ill, Sunshine to me is haunted, haunted still; Therefore it is that in the noontide hours I walk 'mid Visions deep and Mystic Powers;â 'Tis therefore in the Golden, Golden Sun, My Web of Memory is most sweetly spun! SOLITUDE. Where the old gorgeous Heavens in Pride expand O'er some uncultured, yet some lovely Landâ Or where they frown in stern and stormy gloom Above Wild Wastesâthat yet shall smile and bloom Unto the Emparadising Eye of Hopeâ For which fair Visions spread, bright Prospects opeâ The Emparadising Eye of Hope, Zeal, Love, Which lends to Earth beneath and Heav'n above A charm, a glory, and a wond'rous power, Through every Season, and through every hourâ Where ancient Forests stand that still have stood, By man's bold hand unthinned, a World of Wood, Till Earth beneath their burthening weight seems bowed, While huge they stretchâa solid Night of Cloudâ A mighty Darknessâa majestic gloomâ Black, stern, and frowning, as the Shades of Doomâ Or where the awful and triumphant Main Displays his glorious, wide-unfolding Plainâ Where the Great Waters and their Powers have scope (They that with Time and Change uninjured cope) Vast as their stern Sublimities demand, For Ocean reignsâthe grandest of the grandâ Where the Winds peal wild music, dread and loud, Creation's powerful Organists, and proud!â And there comes streaming from the wond'rous Stars, When nought the Beauty of their Mystery mars, A high, and deep, and Sovereign Consciousness, That steeps the Soul in its sublime excess; A Sovereign Consciousness that not dismays, But awes the Spirit into Prayer and Praise, But with a lovely and a tender awe, That chains the thoughts and doth the feelings draw, Till deepens into Happiness august, Fraught with a perfect peaceâa boundless trustâ That strong, and full, and Soul-absorbing sense, Which gathering grows intense and more intense.â (It is a Happiness that not from Earth May draw its mighty and its solemn birth, 'Tis worthy of a Mind and Spirit free, Worthy the Sons of Immortality! Worthy the Heirs of the Everlasting Heaven, The upraised, the blessed, the loved, and the forgiven! Unmixed with passion, unalloyed by fear!â The happiness of some diviner sphere, It well may with its sainted glow, appear! Oh! blessed beyond the happiness of thisâ Being and Feeling then are deepest Blissâ We draw in joy with every rapturous breath, And not the frail joy of this world beneath, Dashed with suspicionâdarkened with regretâ And joined with feelings we would fain forget.) Where the green Beauty of bright spicy Isles Smiles in lone Oceanâdeeply, gladd'ning smiles; Where those sweet knots of fairy Worlds apart Shine, like enchanted Edens of the heart; Or where the enormous rocks on some wild shore Rebellow, echoing to the tempest's roarâ Frown back its stormy shadows, and defy The thunders of the Sea and of the Sky! Where the dread Mountains stand, sublime and lone, Rising through each distinct and differing zone, (In those great, glorious, wide-extended Lands, Where the Everlasting Hills in Giant bands Sweep down from Sea to Sea, outstretched, immense, In their huge pomp of Stern Magnificence!) And while Earth at their feet shines bright and fair, Their cloud-raked foreheads tower all bald and bare, Uncrown'd of odoriferous flower or herbâ Yet in their haughty barrenness superb. All Climates, Seasons, Natures, they embrace, Summer and Beauty live around their baseâ Above, dim woody Regions intervene, And deeper features mark the changing scene, Then growths more scant and stunted, line the ground, And vegetation seems to languish round. And where the mighty Mount soars higher still, The air is edged with an eternal chill; Till at the farthest point, the loftiest crest, Perennial Winter dwells, in horror drest; While icy peaks, and domes of blinding snow, Glare coldly on the smiling World below.â Or where mad Cataracts come sweeping down, Whose deafening trumpets soundâfor ever blown Without a moment's pause, and shake the Skies, While still from Earth to Heav'n their loud notes rise Unchanged, as ev'n the Sphere's Dread Harmonies! The fearful Cataracts, that rush and rave, And thundering rollâa whitening World of Wave, Where Nature and where Solitude unfold Their glorious storesâtheir treasures spread unroll'd. By Mountain, or by Forest, or by Sea, Or Wildernessâor lonely Regions freeâ Or in far Islandsâor 'mid stubborn Rocksâ Or near the Cataractâwhose jarring shocks Disturb the solid Earthâwhose deafening roll Enters the eternalâthe immaterial Soul! There let the Poet-Spirit proudly be, For there alone shall it be glad and free! Let the Poetic Spirit hasten thereâ Let the rapt Mind to these make swift repairâ There shall it find its proud and lofty sphere, There shake off worldly care and worldly fearâ Thereâthere it shall cast down the chains of Earth, And burst at once into sublimer Birth! And break at once to purer Worlds away, And blaze to brighter Beingâfreed from clay, And live a Spirit's high and glorious life, With new delights and strange enchantments rife!â While streams a breathless Consciousness sublime Of things that own not the controul of Time Throughout the deep, wide, boundless Infinite, And the Soul's mighty thoughts are link'd and knit With wond'rous and unutterable things, And freely rise on glad and fearless wings! And far doth the unincarcerated Mind Leave narrow doubts and grovelling griefs behind; All truths, all glories, and all mysteries high, Seemed bared then to the Spirit's unseal'd eye, And the wide Earth and the o'er-roofing Skies Form one vast Universal Paradise!â The Dreamer's Paradiseâdivineâsupremeâ And oh! what Worlds may live within a Dream! Enchanted and Soul-kindling Solitude! By thee are hearts with Heavenly thoughts imbued; Thou yieldest a Bliss, pure, hallow'd, and refined, Attempering and aggrandizing the Mind, Heightening its aims, ennobling its desiresâ Thy peace can purify its wildest fires!â Its poor ambitions and vain cravings all Submit to that sublime and gracious thrall; Thou canst soothe down each harsh unequal mood, And bless the Soul with pure celestial good. Thereforeâwhere Solitude and Nature reign, Whose glorious annals are without a stainâ Where the' old and gorgeous Heavens shine down superb On the deep Waters that ne'er felt a curbâ Where the rough Wilderness doth wide expandâ Where flow bright Streams thro' some uncultured Landâ Where Mountains soar aloftâwhere Forests frownâ Where tumbling Cataracts roll thundering downâ Or lonely Islands smile amid the Seas, With emerald slopes, and with far feath'ring treesâ Or rocky Coasts resound with Ocean's roar, And Peace seems banish'd from the iron-bound shoreâ There let the bright Poetic Spirit fly, From Earth to Heavenâfrom Time to Eternity! THE DELIGHTS OF IMAGINATION. Oh! 'tis a deep Delight to conjure round (What time the Mind unburthened and unbound Springs to its native strengthâits natural sway) A lovely host of thingsâthat float away Only to yield their place to lovelier still, That Earth and Air with joy and beauty fill. Sweet Beings gaze on us with dream-soft eyes, Beneath whose lids a depth of sweetness lies, Fair eyes, that bluely gleam those lids below, Like half-blown violets breaking from sunn'd snow; And flute-like voices, faint and murmuring, wake Soft echoes in our hearts, that answer make Unto the music which themselves have wrought, The melodies of Feeling and of Thought! For those are fairy beings of the heart, And strong Imagination bids them start, Arrayed in Truth's fair formâTruth's vivid glow, To wean us from the graves and gloom below; And if bright Faith illume our mortal years, Those Beings smile like Visions from the Spheres, And every beam within their blissful eyes Then lights our every thought unto the skies; And every tone within their dulcet strain Lifts us above our earthly doom of Pain; For only, while from worldly things apart, In kindling mood swells high the fervent heartâ May we, the oppressed, the o'erwrought, the o'erwearied, know Serene Exemption from the stings of Woe! Imagination!âFairy of the Soul!â What golden clouds about thy pathway roll, And wrap us round as in a dazzling shroud, A Heavenly Privacy of Sun and Cloud! Since, oh! thy Clouds are made of Sunshine allâ A Heaven-like Privacyâa splendid thrallâ Even Passion, link'd with thee, leaves Earth behind, And soars on high with more of burning Mind, With less of dust and darknessâthan defiled Before his wond'rous nature, proud and wild; With less of dregs and drossâa mightier thing, More blest with pure, true Wealthâmore free of wingâ And though indeed the clay-swathed Child of Earth, Yet consecrating thatâhis place of birth, Until the Universal World he makes An Universal Shrine, o'er which there breaks A glorious Light from Heavenâanother Lightâ Another Sun than that which flames on sightâ A Light intense as clearâand deep as pure, That while the Soul exists shall still endure! Imagination!âSorceress of the Mind!â Set free by thee, the quick thoughts unconfined Shoot the dread gulphs that yawn and frown around (Those gulphs of mystery knowledge fails to sound) And all about themâo'er those gulphs so dread As o'er the fair World they encireleâshed Unsparingly their living treasures fair, Till all is radianceâall is Glory there, Pure, precious Sungiftsâdazzling rainbow dyesâ And many a Vision that sublimely vies With proud Creation's animated Scene, (When clouds and shadows frown not dark between Its pomps immortal and our mortal sight,) They scatter round themâstrong, and full, and bright!â So burst the freed thoughts from their icy bound, When thou dost wake them from a trance profound. When Night gives way to Morning's Beautyâhark, While thrills the clear air to the mounting lark, How mingle with his fine and happy strains, Yet loftier, livelier tonesâdiviner veins Of music that those harmonies unchecked, With finer, fuller breathings intersect! It is thy voice, Imaginationâthine, That bids new numbers with his strains entwine; In thine own self art thou a Seraph choir, Earth is thine instrument, high Heaven thy Lyre. How dost thou with thy matchless minstrelsies Outsing the rolling Spheres that thrill the Skies, The full-voiced Spheres, that take up with their Hymn The Strains of Cherubim and Seraphim!â When Sunset kindles all the blushing West, And Earth is wrapped as in a regal vest, Deep dyed with many crimsonsâwhose rich shades (For here the tint flames darklier, there it fades,) Burn with a changeful Beauty evermore, Till the bright hour rolls by and all is o'er, And Earth and Heaven mourn o'er the death of Day, Veiledâsolemn-suitedâgirdled round with gray!â How doth thy mighty spell, the deep and warm, With more than Magic suddenly transform The lifeless Pageantry of Clouds above, To living masses that breathe, act, and move. Perchance there seems to spread a Field of War, With staff and bannerâand with steed and car; There steel-girt Warriors' arms flash back the day (The crimson day, that dies in Heaven away!) And so profoundly dost thou rule the Mind, Till the Sense acts with thee and it, combined (O'erstepping thus its functionsâand thus won, To mix in that sweet treason thou hast begun) That not alone by thy rich trammels bound, Are we thus mocked by sight, but mocked by sound!â We seem to hear the clanging hosts engage On that far field, that wide and wond'rous stage, Till loud the Artillery pealsâDeath's hollow chimeâ The Battle-thunder's tumult pierced sublime By lofty Battle Music!ârolling proud Through the deep uproar, swelling long and loud, And the Air is thrill'd with conquering Harmony, And living Echoes leap along the Sky, Then ever and anon, with furious speed, Rings loud the stamp of the impetuous Steed, (Who feels the fiery war in every nerve, With panting chest and vein-swollen neck, whose curve Is as a living arch of triumph, decked With glittering trophies, while he bounds unchecked 'Mid the confusion, on his haughty course, With desperate energy and thundering force;) Then, on the sudden, all is changed; behold Some stir, some trifling movement unforetold, Hath instantaneously transformed the scene From what so lately it had brightly been. But lo! while that away is swiftly rolled, Another full as splendid doth unfold, Though haply more irregularly wild, While towers and tents appear together piled; The panting War-horse paws no longer there, But scaly Dragons cut the crimson air, And cumbrous Elephants, encumbered more With weighty trappings, whose raised trunks explore The troubled element as if in fear, In all their huge conspicuousness appear; And mighty monsters, nameless and unknown, 'Mid the confused and changeful scene are shown, Like the old Behemoth of boundless size, And join that fiery conflict in the skies! And evermore the bright disorder grows, Far, far and wide the unmeasured prospect glows, With all its tints of purple and of rose. Myriads of Warriors to the combat press, While fails the eye beneath that rich excess Of endless gloryâyet doth ever seize Fresh glimpse of objects stranger still than these, Till all the blazing scene grows grey and cold, And one dim wreck of splendour we behold! Oh! the unbounded Empire of the Mind, The wond'rous treasures in its holds enshrined! And, oh! the Infinite Sovereignties of Thought! To which Earth's noblest Kingdoms are as nought; With all their greatnessâall their proud display, Their wealth, their strength, their glory, and their sway! The Infinite, dazzling Sovereignties of Thought!â On Earth what wonders hath great Knowledge wrought!â How mighty Wisdom hath, with powers profound, The Secrets of Creation learned to soundâ How hath the indefatigable Mind The treasures reaped, in Nature's bosom shrined. But Thou! Imaginationâthough perchance Thou hast not pierced, with deep and thoughtful glance, The Mysteries of the Universe Sublime, Nor to proud Science's heights aspired to climb, Nor traced Great Nature's high Eternal laws Up to the point where Angels even might pause! Thou hast a Universe all, all thine ownâ A Shadowy Universeâthy Realm and Throne! For there thou brood'st in all thy boundless State (While thy winged Ministers beside thee wait) A Presence every where! and all around Thy Regal Canopy, without a bound, Doth gloriouslyâimmeasurably spread, In one unbroken splendour o'er thy head. Gorgeous and Infinite Sovereignties are thine, And sagest Thought may never pierce a mine More rich in costly spoils than that which thou, Imagination, with the star-wreathed brow, Claim'st for thine own, with unexhausted veins, Bright as the Galaxy in Heaven's lit plains; Rich as Hesperian fruitsâPactolian sandsâ For treasure grows beneath thy gathering hands! Thy Kingdoms are of Air and living Light, Clad in immortal Glory!âsmooth and bright; Outstretched like Summer Seas thy realms extend, Smooth, smooth and brightâon sweeping without end, Like Summer Seasâclear, glittering Summer Seasâ Yet, oh! far lovelier, far more fair than these, Without Horizon or surmounting Sky! Their own sweet Heavenâof Sunny radiancy! Gorgeous and Infinite Sovereignties are those O'er which thou reignest in glad and proud reposeâ But one stern Foe thou hastâworst Foe to theeâ A Host in strength and powerâReality! How doth her fatal dire approach destroy Thy stately triumphs and thy splendid joy; How do these Glorious Apparitions fade, Which crowded to thy call, in light array'dâ The Visions of another World and Lifeâ When she appearsâwith Joy and thee at strife!â When Dreams that erst so brightly seemed to be, Fair Crowning Revelationsâdeep and free, Of rich mysterious Truths fleet fast away, Like unreal Ghosts that fly the Light of Day!â Cold, strong Reality!âshe harshly brings Her frosty fetters for thy bubbling springs; She scatters far thy proud and priceless stores, And blights the Beauty of thy golden shores. How doth she veil at once thy rich Display, And sweep thy blest illusions all away, And check the flight of each far-soaring Thought, Rife with glad hopeâwith boundless rapture fraught, And through the dazzling Mazes of its Dream Lead back the Mindâshorn of each Magic beam; No more, like some deep Instrument, to raise Immortal Strains of Gladness and of Praise To the o'erruling Heaven, (whose Mighty Power Bestows the transports of its Crowning Hour), Those Strains that scarcely seem to be its own, Such lofty meaning breathes through every tone. Aye! listening to itself, it well may deem, Borne on that Harmony's deep rolling stream, That those triumphant songsâthose conquering lays, Which high the thoughts o'er Earthly things must raise, Are the Eternal Melodies that roll Through the Eternal Mansions of the Soulâ The Music of the Heavens!âthe Heavens aboveâ That almost melt to those deep strains of Loveâ The Music of the Heavens!âthat thrill and ringâ The Music consecrated to their King! Imagination! let me know once more Thy kindling presence as I knew before, Though dark Reality at length must come To chase thy glories with her own cold gloom! THE HAPPY LAND OF DREAMS. When we are wanderers in the Land of Dreams, The Land of cloudless stars and waveless streams, The Land of golden temples, chrystal towers, And bright enchanted fruits and deathless flowers, How do our floating thoughts appear to be Mixed to one Strain of perfect Harmony! Yes, then the quickened, unencumbered mind, That leaves its cares, and doubts, and fears behind, Rejoiceth in Itselfâand finds a voice To tell out to Itself it doth rejoice!â Then freed from Earth's sepulchral wastes and glooms, A Melody of Thoughts that Mind becomes! Till while it hearkens to its own sweet strain, Which gently doth enthrall it and enchain, It feels the rapture that ne'er knew a bound, And dreams of Angel-presences around! And who shall say that Angels may not stoop From Heaven and gather roundâa glorious groupeâ To listen to those thoughts, that, pure and free, Flow to one rich celestial Melody, Like that bright Saintâhaunted by Seraph throng, That loved the Echoes of a Mortal Songâ We may be circled round by Shapes divineâ While pours the Soul its deep-toned Music fine! What happy scenes to our rapt senses rise, While golden slumber on the tired lid lies, If Fancy and if Feeling strongly reign O'er the impassioned Heartâthe enkindling brain, Bright Heavenly Hopes with Earthly Memories sweet, There richly blend, and exquisitely meet. Yes! Heaven and Earth together mingling seem, In the dear rapture of that blessed Dream, When Earth wears hues of beauty to the eye, Caught from the glorious realms of Light on high,â And Heavenâthe glimpsed and glowing Heaven, the while A sweet familiar lookâan Earth-born smile! Ayeâby fair Visions of Elysium blessed Shall be the Soulâby Love and Faith possessed, By Fancy and by Feeling finely fraught, By Virtue tempered, and by Nature taught, When golden Slumber, in its beauty lies Upon the lids that shroud the wearied eyes! And still those Visions shall more clearly glow, And, crowned by wing'd Imagination, grow Lofty and beautiful as white-robed Truth, Pure as the Starsâe'en bright as the Heart's youth. (For that alone is Youth!âere one sweet light Hath been withdrawn into Affliction's night, Ere one deep feeling hath been crushed away In quick decrepitude and forced decay!â Oh! the Heart's youthâhow oft doth that depart While all is youngâexcept, except the Heart! How oft hath that irrevocably flown Ere Life's full strength and treasures are our own, Ere its more ripened Seasons have matured That frame where dwells the Immortal Soul immured)â Dreams! Summer-sunshine Pageants of the Heart!â JoyâGloryâHopeâLightâLoveâhow soon ye part, That should for ever stay, when actual things Are full of thorns, and cankers, and of stingsâ (Yet oft ye leaveâOh! golden Dreams!âbehind A glowing freshness, living through the Mind, And freshening o'er the fainting, failing Heart, That ceased alone beneath your smiles to smart!)â Lovely in your developements ye are! Restorers of the emotions pure, which Care May have subdued, or weakened, or repressed, Though once of glowing truth, and warmth possessed. Regenerators of Life's Energies!â Renewers of the Hope that hidden lies In the Heart's closest core, for, loath to part, Hope seeks the inmost chamber of that Heart, When storms are sternly gathering far around (What time harsh Disappointment comes to wound) And dwells therein unknown and unavowed, Like a young Sunbeam burning in a Cloudâ Till something calls it forthâonce more to play In light and lifeâto rend its shining way, And burst at once from Darkness into Day! Oft, oft by happy dreams 'tis thus call'd forth, Oh! happy Dreamsâwhat words can speak your worthâ What language can your loveliness unfoldâ Bright luxuriesânever to be bought by goldâ Peace to the troubled and the oppressed are ye, And rest to those long-toss'd on Life's rough Sea! Unnumbered fairy-gifts 'tis yours to grant, Love to the Lorn ye areâWealth unto Wantâ Health unto SicknessâBrightness unto Gloomâ A respite to the Wretch who shrinks from Doomâ Power to the Weakâand Cheer unto the Loneâ And freedom to the Slave, who lives to groanâ Balm unto PainâYouth unto Ageâand Sight Unto the Blindâand to the SadâDelight! DreamsâDreamsâOh! ye are most precious to the Soul, When to one Harmony ye wake the whole, A perfect melody of thoughts supremeâ While Heaven and Earth to us become a Dreamâ The Sun Eternal, and the Stars Sereneâ The Firmamentsâthe SeaâCreation's Sceneâ All Wonders, Glories, Elements, and Powers, Become the Vassals of its dreaming Hours! And the Universe within our deep thought lives, Robed in the splendour which that deep thought gives, Etherialized into a World of Soul, While yet the Spirit through whose regions roll, Those Mighty Visions in their boundless Pride Becomes as 'twere a Universe beside,â And acts Creation to Itselfâas though SunâStarsâEarthâHeavenâmight be transmuted so! Then 'tis that Angels stoopâor seem to stoopâ From yonder Heights, to form a radiant Groupe Around the Slumberer's placeâfrom realms above, The Realms of Triumph, Rapture, Life, and Loveâ Descending in their Beauty and their Might, To Sun themselves within these Dreams of Light, To hearken to these thoughtsâwhose deep, low song Vies with the strain of the Celestial Throngâ And so their Heaven awhile they deign to find Within the vast sphere of the Human Mindâ Within the precincts of a Mortal's thought, With kindling ardour and strong fervour fraughtâ Within the dreaming Spirit's glorious tranceâ The Spirit bowed before their burning glance!â And borne on its melodious thought's bright stream, To find or form a Heav'n within a Dream! DEATH AND INFANCY. My Baby-brother!â'tis long, long ago That I sawâbitter sight of dreariest woeâ Thy little form of pale beauty laid In Death, and in funeral robe arrayed! I gazed on theeâsweet one!âso pale and chill, Oh! breathlessly Beauteousâbut Beauteous still, And whispered thy name in thy senseless ear, I whispered, yet knew that thou couldst not hear! I kissed those sweet lips that poured no breath, Nor shrank from that contact with awful Death; Thy pale little pulseless hand I took,â Still mine own young nerves neither shrank nor shook. Oh, Death! though then I first looked on thee, Thou worest a Heavenly mien to meâ Nor fear chained my pulse, nor checked my breath, Tho' then 'twas I looked on thee first, O Death. My childish sorrow 'twas most I felt, As close by the coffin I weeping knelt; And thought 'twas the darkest and deadliest doom Thus soon to be borne to the dull deep tomb! And I trembled not, then though I sorrowed much, Nor shrank, O Death! from thy sight or touch; And still the heart in my bosom cried, âOh! Child!âsweet Child!âwould for thee I had died.â The Beauty thy lifeless aspect bore Made my Love yet deeper, my Sorrow more; And still I thought 'twas the heaviest doom To be borne thus soon to the Grave's dull gloom! My Baby-brotherânow things I know That may let me think no longer soâ The World I thought then a World of Light, I have found a World but of Death and Night! I sorrowed for theeâfor thee I mournedâ While the tears down my cheek fast flowing burnedâ Oh! had I known, all that now I know, For myself I had wept with a wiser woe! My Baby-brotherâto thee was given A cloudless Earth and an early Heaven; To meâmy Baby-brother!âto meâ All that hath taught me to envy thee! SWEET BOWER! Sweet Bower! to thee I haste once moreâ Long lovedâbut ne'er more loved before! For absenceâtrialsâgrief and fearâ TheseâChildhood's cherished things endear! When conversant with Life's harsh strife, And all the pangs and pains of Life, We learn then truly how to prize All Childhood viewed with loving eyes. 'Tis then we feelingly compare Its joys, so free from doubt and care, With those maturer joysâwhich still Are mingled with too much of ill. And all that then we prized and loved, Favoured and cherished and approved, We doubly loveâtill won from pain We learn to love Ourselves again! This heavy Heart may come no more Dancing and bounding as beforeâ But in its thoughtful stillness swells A Love that ne'er with Childhood dwells. Too many smiling things divert Sweet Childhood's light and leaping heartâ Joy, Hope, and Fancy, there abide, And many a beauteous Dream beside. But Joy, and Hope, and Fancy bright, And all beside that poured Delight, Forsake us as we onward move, And leaveâbehindâbut Love! deep Love! We loseâin all beside we lose, Exchanging for sweet pleasuresâwoes For hopesâdim fears, for smilesâdark tears, But gain in theeâOh! Loveâby years! No more with happy, thoughtless heart, Can I return as I could partâ And full as happy, thoughtless strainâ Yet, Bower, to thee I come again. Not now to sing thy starry flowers, Fostered by Sun and sunny showersâ Those living scentsâthose laughing bloomsâ Thy breezy hauntsâthy leafy gloomsâ No!âSummer other eyes may please, With beams, and birds, and buds, and bees; She hath a rival now with me, A Summer-shineâof Memory! Those singing birdsâthose blossomed treesâ Those flowering bordersâbuds and beesâ For me are now in vainâin vainâ At least they wake but loving pain! Those birds must vainly strain the throat, My heart responds with no light note; These flowers and rays must vainly smile, My heart is dark as Death the while. And thou too art not as thou wert, Changed, but not changed like my poor heart; Thou art not as thou wertâAlas!â I am notâthat which, once, I was! Sweet Bower! some altering hand hath been Too busy with thy still bright sceneâ Oh! still 'tis brightâthat scene; but hereâ Within this heartâall, all is drear! Thou art not changed like my poor heartâ But yetâthou art not as thou wert; Thou art not what thou wertâAlas! And IâI am not what I was! WAKING DREAMS. Sleep's Dreams are fair, but fairer Waking Dreams, When lost in its own self the Spirit seems To wander at its own glad willâfarâfarâ While here it finds a Cloud, and there a Starâ A gorgeous Cloud of Mysteryâa rich gloom, Flushed like the deepest Sunset's crimson bloom! A glorious Starâunknown, unseen before, That lights its way to thousand thousands more! Now doth it meet with some exhaustless Mine, Where treasures without name or number shine; Now with some ever fresh and living Spring, Which all around appears bright wealth to fling! Yes! fair are Slumber's Dreams, but lovelier still Those Waking Dreams, which we may shape at willâ Those Waking Dreams, crown'd, heightened, glorified, By the rich Sunshine kindling round in pride, Which melts itself through the unconscious thought, Till the Outward World and that Within are wrought Together to One Gloryâand the whole BecomesâOne Heavenly Universe of Soul! Moments grow then to bright Eternities, The thoughts roll on like stars through cloudless skies! Oh! Waking Dreamsâas we in Life advance More rare becomes the rich ecstatic trance, Stern, strong Realities around us close, And those Realities too oftenâWoes! Our thoughts become absorbed in other things, Each day some dark and mournful lesson brings, And we have countless claims upon our time, And moveâpoor Exiles of the Enchanted Climeâ The Sweet Enchanted Clime of Fancy thenâ Our Country is the Worldâour Comrades, Men!â We must resign the Starry Dream-Land fair, And the bright Beings that we met with there! Our hours are given to care, our heavy hours, Not told by diamond Sandsânor marked by folding Flowers. THE MOURNFUL GUEST. I passed through the Hallâ Bright and joyous seemed allâ But one Form drew my rapt looks there; Not all from the grace Of a matchless faceâ But the fixed look of frozen Despair! The look of Despair That aspect did wearâ It was that chained my long-lingering gaze; I turned from the rest To the pale, lorn Guestâ 'Twas my pity she wonânot my praise! I might not reveal What I learned to feel While I gazed on that joyless brow; No deep words could tell What I felt too well, What I strongly felt then, and now! But these fond alarms Sprang not from her charmsâ (Though perchance they might fan the fire) Nor the dazzling display Of her pompous arrayâ For all royal was her attire! Not her queen-like grace, Nor her beauteous face, Then so drew and so fixed my sightâ 'Twas to see her stand there, With that look of Despair, Like a shroud around Sunshine and Light! I turned from the gay That crowded the wayâ To that desolate Being I turnedâ In that proud festal room Fixed and sealed was my doom, And my heart with Love's fervency burn'd. With a tremulous tone Then I asked of oneâ Who had followed her steps thro' the Hallâ That pale Being's name Who had lighted the flame In a heart that had long scorn'd Love's thrall. How the accents did flow (Distinctlyâthough low)â Of the answer he gave to my wordsâ Through my Sense to my Soul, Till they maddened the whole, And thrilled harshly my heart's quiv'ring chords! Oh! the pale, mournful Guest Was the Queen of the Feastâ (Wretched Victim of cold heartless Pride!)â That lorn Being so fair, With her sad hopeless air, It was she, was the Palatine's Bride! Still she haunts this crushed heart, Which thro' Life will ne'er part With that Vision of Sorrow and Loveâ Still I see her stand there, With her look of Despair, Although now she's a freed Saint above! THE TWILIGHT TIME. It was a silent and a lovely Time, Earth, Air, and Skyâsteeped in a calm sublime, Appeared to lie as some vast Picture liesâ Like their own Images in lifeless guise, Yet in that Stillness void of stir and strifeâ In sooth there was Intensity of Life! Not such as lightly to the Surface springs, But such as dwells in the deep Heart of Thingsâ Fullâferventâwond'rousâsilentâunrevealed, And yet not chained, or weakened, or concealedâ But only to be felt and understood By one exalted to a rapturous mood, Then is such Silence loftiest Eloquence, And Revelation glorious and intense Such deep concentered Stillness! then we know And feel a Life which through our own doth flowâ A Life not such as on the surface plays E'en like the far-diverging scattered raysâ But like the Sun's deep quenchless heart of flame, That ever burnsâfull, perfect, and the sameâ This is the Life that strong, deep, mighty, lone, Flows keen through oursâAh! is it not our ownâ Our own Existence, that released from thrall, O'erflows the Universeâand quickens all? Such Beauteous MomentsâBeauteous Thoughts awake And from the Soul its Mortal burthen takeâ Then Visions are vouchsafed to watchful Eyesâ Deep Hearts thrill with mysterious Ecstacies! In the declining Twilight's shadowy hour There is a Truthâa Beauty and a Powerâ There is a solemnizing Influence deep, That wakes the Heartâyet lulls its Cares to Sleep! Then 'tis the Soul becomes a Spirit indeed!â And seems to put aside its Earthly weed, And shine out in its own sublime array, The Glory and the Brightness of the Day! Beyond our clouded Destinies we climbâ There is such Might in the still Twilight Time. Yea! Mighty Soul!âthen free and strong thou art, And quick to feel art thouâoh! fervent Heart! From heart and Soul are drawn, in that fine hour, Long-hidden feelings, full of truth and powerâ Press'd like the juice from ripe fruits of the Vine, From out the Soul is Inspiration's Wine!â The wine of rich Emotions strong and clear, Intense and pure as Love's first pearly tear, That sparkling living Wineâa spring unspentâ In no frail Earthly Vessel pour'd and pent!â There is a solemnizing influence sweet, In Twilight's lovely hourâso fair and fleetâ Then Fairy-treasures to the mind are given, And soothed is the opened Heartâlong bruised and riven; And Fairy-dews then quench its fevered thirst, And calm the doubts and fears it fondly nursed. Oh! no such power is in that radiant Timeâ The glowing hour of rich and rosy Prime, When wakes the World-rejoicing Lord of Light, To walk in all the rapture of his Might! What time the Lark mounts fearlessly on high, To flood the Air with ringing Melody, And clearly tunes his ever-grateful song, Whose living lightnings leap the skies along, (Keen Music-lightnings piercing heart and sense, Long-flashingâand far-spreading and intense; Arrows of silver soundâo'erpowering sound, That but with Ecstacy of Wonder wound!) That Music of the Monarch-sun which seems Brought forth from that veiled source which prompts his beams, As though the Harmony and Light were oneâ Together issuing from his burning throne! Oh! Twilight's hour is still a mightier hour Of deeper influence and of finer power!â Then, wond'rous Visitants around us come That surely never owned a Mortal Home, Fair as the Moon's young Majesty serene, Throned amongst Purple gloomsâa radiant Queenâ So beautifulâso exquisiteâso bright, With such deep looks of never-fading Light, That we might almost think from Worlds above Those Heavenly Spirits of undying Love, The matchless Seraphsâfirst and fairestâcame To kindle Earth with their own Holy Flameâ They whom no glorious Spirits can excel, Of all who in the Eternal Mansions dwellâ The Seraphsâwhose divine and deathless eyes Have evermoreâOh, wiser than the wise!â Streamed with a Fire of Adorations pureâ With Love that hath endured and shall endure; The Highest of the Heavenly Nations brightâ The purest of the perfect Sons of Light! Oh! do these haunts our Hearts to quicken there Deep Feelings such as they supremely share?â Till spiritualized our thrill'd Hearts grow, And our Imaginationsâas they flow Through all Creationsâtill most brightly shed Around our Lightâso darkâour Life so dead, A clear, transparent and transcendant glowâ A glorious Sense of Being here below Seems then to be!âand o'er ourselves we are raised, Because we have adored, and loved, and praised! Then o'er the ample tablet of the Mind Ten thousand forms of Beauty are designed, For ever there in lovely might to reignâ Stamped softly, yet for ever to remainâ As brightly traceableâand so our Thought For after timesâwith rich delight is fraught, And never wholly parts with all its gains, In such deep moments when 'tis freed from chainsâ When o'er our clouded Destinies we climb, Such Power there is in theeâsweet Twilight time. AH, ME! HOW MUCH I PITY THOSE. Ah, me! how much I pity those Who know not Love's delicious woesâ Who careless and indifferent move Through this dark Worldâbut lit by Love! Who know not how his griefs can be Worth every vain Felicity! Who think they walk in shining light, Wrapped all the while in clouds and Night! Ah, me! how much I pity those Who dwell in such abhorred repose, Who such a Peace ignoble shareâ A Peaceâthe feeling Heart's despair! I pity those who nothing know But selfish joy and selfish woe: How narrow their dull world must be; How little can they hear and see! For Love is still the Power, the Sense, Life, strength, Thought, knowledge, spring from thence; And if deep Love they may not know, Their Wisdom's noughtâtheir Weal is Woe. I pity those who dream of Bliss 'Mid shadows where no substance isâ Who want the smiles my Love gives me, To reach the Adored Reality! Ah, me! how much I pity those Who know not Love's too precious woesâ Who want the smiles my Love gives me, To reach his dear Reality. Those smiles worth all the worldâthose smilesâ Love's sweetest Lightsâhis richest wilesâ Worth all the boundless World to meâ Ye Lovelessâhow I pity ye! I TURN TO THEE. I turn to thee when I would weep, Mother of silent Sorrows deep;â Pale Memory! I must turn to thee When I would shed fond tears and free. For, oh! there is a weightâa chain Upon my heartâaround my brainâ And the stern Present, hard and cold, Such sweet relief doth still withhold! Let me remember how of yore I felt unto my Heart's quick core, While every feeling that I felt, In tears or smiles did glow or melt! And thus rememberingânot in vainâ (Freed from that weight and from that chain) Oh! let me pourâunfettered pourâ My long-crushed feelings forth once more. Mother of Mighty Sorrows deepâ Pale Memoryâteach me now to weepâ Let me upon thy bosom rest, And shed those tears too long suppress'd. THE CHERISHED LOT. My Lot is fixedâshall I complain If it be Joyâor it be Painâ Since oh!âif this or that it proveâ At least it ever must be Love. And ifâoh! Heavenly Providence, I am doomed to draw but Grief from thence, I feel I so shall love my Grief, I shall not wish e'en for relief! Be but that Bitterness mine all, Nor let o'er thee its shadow fall, And well the burthen I can bearâ Though darkeningâdarkening to Despair! Be all that Bitterness mine ownâ So long as Grief is mine aloneâ So long as it may touch not thee, What Grief can harm or trouble me? Then let me joy my Lot is fixed, Come wealâcome woeâcome both commixed, At least that cherished Lot shall prove One deathless Destiny of Love! THOUGHTS ON OTHER WORLDS. Oh! Thoughtsâoh! Dreamsâoh! communings supreme Above all mortal thoughtâall earthly Dreamâ Oh! Glorious VisitantsâEtherial Guestsâ Whose presence Love's quick consciousness attests, Bright Contemplationâproud Companionship, From our raised minds their worldly gloom to strip, To enfranchise and to illumine themâbehold Sovereign are Solitude and Nature old! Then we exist to nobler purpose far Than when engaged in Life's tumultuous Warâ Companionship and Contemplation proud! Which none enjoy amongst the Worldling Crowd. Oh! the deep Truth of Nature and the Light, The Beauty of Creation and the Might! The Eloquence and Mystery of the wholeâ The life, the force, the feeling, and the Soul. Nature! thy Scenesâthy Stores are ever new, Bathed in the freshness of Heaven's living dew, Anointed with the oil of Gladness still, What change shall mar thee with Decay's foul Ill? Thy mighty Fountains still exhaustless play, Thy glorious Flames are kindling day by day; Thy wond'rous pulses beat, nor know to pauseâ For evermore endure thy steadfast laws; And when we turn from Vanity and Strife To thee, and live in thy Stupendous Life, Unnumbered sources of Delight we find To exalt the Emotions and to melt the Mindâ The Emotions and the Affections to upraise, And melt the thoughts to gratitude and praise. Oh! mighty Sources of Supreme Delight, And endless Contemplation full of Might, Find weâto exalt, to purify, and bless, And cheer with high and boundless Happiness, Great Nature! in thy lofty paths and pureâ A Happiness which shall unchanged endure! Thenâthenâeven thou and all thou hast are oursâ The Elements and their undying Powers, The worlds of light and all their phases fair,â The worlds that sparkle through the azure air, The mighty Seasons and their mysteries all, These, these, and thouâeven thou our own we call. Thou'rt then our ownâand all that is of thineâ And our deep thought then makes thee more divine! Yesâwhen we walk forth in unworldly ways, And quit the busy sceneâthe social maze, Nature and all her attributes sublime, The lore, the treasures, and the works of Time, All truths, all charms, all mysteries, and all powers, Are then our ownâthe Universe is ours! In such deep moments we are surely blest, And the great Soul hath gladness for its guest! But oh! there is a loftier Joy than this There is a nobler and a deeper bliss; There is a Joy as pure and more profound, A Rapture deathless and without a bound, A trance of Gladness yet more rich and full, That never can exalt the cold and dullâ A grander, higher, heavenlier Happiness, Which is but lost in its own dread excess! It is of other Worlds the mystic sense, O'erpowering, and absorbing, and intenseâ That strange electrifying Consiousness Whose glorious fulness doth so richly bless!â The intoxicating Inspirations strong, Which bear the yielding Soul with them along, And all the Ecstacies that thus are brought Unto the adoring Heartâthe impassioned Thought; Keen Ecstacies, that never could from Earth On visible Nature draw their wond'rous birth; Keen Ecstacies, that lift us, as on wings, Above the influence of all mortal thingsâ Beginning and developing in Love, For things immortal, and for Worlds above. Of all the Visions that e'er cross'd the brain, Of all that o'er the Imagination reignâ That ever haunted the deep Human Heart, Which, which doth still the sweetest strength assert. Oh! brightest Vision, fairest, most divine Of all that o'er the raptured Mind can shine, Deep Vision of the Heavenly Kings of Loveâ This reigns supreme all other dreams above! The Seraphimâthe radiant Seraphim, By these all else seems lifelessâdull, and dim; The Seraphimâthose deathless Beings bright, For whom Love is the Life and Love the Light! Whose Immortality's of Love aloneâ The deepest Worshippers round Heaven's dread Throne, They pour their Spirit's mighty Melodies (Like waves exhaustless from unfathomed Seas) Incessantly that blazing Throne around, Till ring the Spheres with richer swells of sound! The Heavenliest of all the Heavenly Things That bear the immortal Crown and wear the wings! Their vast Existencesâthe deep and high, For ever deepeningâheightening gloriously!â Their keen Intensities of Feelings strong, All musicalâstill wreaked on rapturous Song!â Yet their great Love, so wond'rous and so wide Seems vain and void, a Mightier Love beside, The Love Almightyâfar beyond all thoughtâ Oh! who shall sum the triumphs it hath wrought! Those Beings who but breathe the breath supreme Of uttermost Adorationsâin one Dreamâ One burning Dream of zeal undying tranced, From Ecstacies to Ecstacies advancedâ They are but novices, but learners stillâ Howe'er they feel the Impulse and the Willâ But faint Reflectors of the Almighty Love, But panting Emulators of the Dove! The All Divine and Everlating Son, The blessed Saviour of a World undone. Though all their glorious Strength on Praise they wreak, And strive their Love to showâtheir Zeal to speak, Their breathlessness of Adoration deep, Is poor and light (howe'er their Souls it steep In rich bright fervours mighty and profound) Compared with that Almighty Loveâthe crowned With Sacrifice astounding and immense, A Love indeed unbounded and intense. Though on deep Worship all their Souls they wreak, Weak is their zeal, and its Revealment weak With that High Love comparedâall truth and lightâ Which passeth understanding in its mightâ The Love of Him who unto them hath given The Eternities of Happiness and Heaven, The power to worship, and the will to adoreâ And oh! to those less worthy, more, far more, A Gift beyond all Gifts, whose costly worth Makes all beside a darkness and a dearth! That GiftâHimself!âHimselfâOh! sacrificeâ Oh! Gift beyond all measure and all price! Yet though their Love must of such Love fall short, Those radiant Worshippers in Heaven's dread Court, Immeasurably adoreâintensely feel, And kindle with a bright and burning zeal, While their unfathomable smiles still prove How bless'd the precious labour of their Love! Systems and Ages melt like snow-flakes round, While they by that deep Love are girt and boundâ Their ecstacy of zeal can know no pause From all Creation, turning to its Cause!â From all the Universe for evermore Still to its Author, turning to adore! Round them unheeded Suns unnumbered shine, And Scenes are spreadâdeep, dazzling, and divine! Their Heaven is all withinâfor there they see The unshadowed Image still of Deity? Oh! grandest, loftiest, noblest Happiness!â Oh! glorious joyâin mystical excess! Triumph of Blissâsurpassing and supreme! To which all Earth's delights are as a Dreamâ Even those delights the uplifted Spirit knows When 'tis allowed to escape from worldly woesâ Received into great Nature's glad Repose! When all itself to her it brightly gives, And in her Life stupendousâbreathes and lives. Yea! even such bliss is left far, far behind By the unassisted, self-awakened Mind!â When borne on high by magic Powersâits ownâ It soars beyond the Visibleâthe Knownâ And dreams of other Worldsâne'er yet made clear To outward senseâbarred still from eye and ear. Oh! Joy, that doth most richly, purely bless, Keen, brain-electrifying Consciousness, Profoundest triumph of unfettered thought, To which its earthlier triumphs are as noughtâ Most glorious trance of Blissâwhich now can know Who wear the dull chains of the World belowâ Exalted Raptureâfresh from yon bright Skies When moments growâdivine Eternities! Each thought becomes a Worldâa living Star, And rolls in crowned Magnificence afar!â While all Creation but appears to be A Veil 'twixt us and the Infinite Mysteryâ Then do we feel, thro' Heart, and Mind, and Frame, A Joy, that hath in this World's tongues no name!â Oh! Joy beyond all Joys, in rich excessâ Oh! grand, and deep, and glorious Happiness! PITY AND LOVE. Child of the Sun!âhis brightest Child! And wouldest thou hear the Stranger's taleâ His wrongs so deepâhis griefs so wildâ Ah! no, 'twould make that rich cheek pale! And oh! bright Offspring of the Sun, I feel, if thou sweet Pity give, By thy compassion more undone, I yet again may love and live. Then let me the dark truth conceal, And struggle still, and suffer on, Again to learn to hope and feel, Would be again to be undone! âStranger, your sorrows will not last, Forget your Fate even now awhile; The Present must become the Past, Or if you weep, or if you smile! âYet tell me why thou seek'st our shore, Only to wail, and grieve, and sigh, While all beside admireâadore Our Clime, our Earth, our Air, and Sky!â âBright Sunlike Daughter of the Sun! Fair Child of these Enchanted Isles! May thy young Life by Fate be spun Into one lustrous web of smiles. âFor meâfor meâI can but weepâ Torn from my homeâmy Heaven of Light; No joy from thy fair Earth I reap, Though sweet its flow'ry stores and bright. âFor meâfor meâI must despair, Driven from my homeâmy Heaven of Love; I sorrowing breathe thy perfumed airâ Shrink from thy very Heavens above!â âAh! say, why leave thy native soil, Thy homeâthy Heaven of Love and Light? Sayâdid she frown on theeâwhose smile Made it a Heaven thus fair and bright?â âLady, I thought her lofty mind Was formed of lovely thoughts and grand, I thought her heart was soft and kind, Even as her beauteous looks were bland. âBut though on me she never frowned, But oh! far worseâdeceiving smiled, Her fickle faithlessness I found, Too long had my weak heart beguiled. âAnd then with tortured Soul I turned From those false wiles and looks so bland, And while with jealous wrath I burned, Forsook my fair, fair Fatherland!â âStranger! thy sorrows move my soul, Too dangerously and deeply move; Forgive these tears that downward roll, And show the Pity that I prove. âStranger! forgive these swelling sighs, Thou would'st not my compassion move!â Never before unto mine eyes Did Pity seem so like to Love!â âLady, I am indeed undoneâ Where'er thou art my Heaven is there; Thy smile must be my own bright Sun, Thy breathâthy breath my Native Air. âThou'st healedâto deeplier wound my heart Thy Pity hath my soul unmannedâ My Native Soil is where thou artâ My Countryâand my Fatherland!â IF GENTLEST SUFFERANCE. If gentlest sufferance and endurance meek Of cold neglect, or notice yet more cold; If fond humility that doth but seek Thy formâthy worshipp'd features to behold; If generous, deep, disinterested zeal, That ever seeks but thy all precious good; If fond devotion to thy dearer weal, And thoughts that but on thee unceasing brood; If an unbless'd but uncomplaining Love, A deep idolatry itself that scornsâ Still feeling the Idolâfar its flights above, While thus its own unworthiness it mourns; If these can win theeâNo, vain dream! begone, These cannot win theeâcannot touch thy heart; None are thus taught to Loveâand none thus won, Love's a spontaneous growthânot raised by art. HOPE! Once, once, how my Spirit triumphantly rose, And challenged Life's troublesâdefied its worst woes; But now Earth's desolations have weigh'd down its wings, Yet Hope's Nightingale still in the Wilderness sings. That Wilderness wild into which it hath sunk, This World's Wilderness cold, from which long, long it shrunk; How unlike the bright fields of the glad azure air, Which it haunted of old ere it struggled with Care! Once, once, how my Heart swelled, elated with youth, As openâas ardentâas cloudless as truth; But each pulse now is check'd by a stern icy hand, Yet Hope's Star still illumes it, that bright Star and bland. Once, once, how the Sunbeams of Gladness were mine, (Ah! in happier eyes still they laugh out and shine), Yet if Hope, Heav'nly Hope, but remaineth mine own, I will cease to regret all the dear raptures flown! THE LOVELY LAND. 'Twas a Land where Divinities (such as of yore The nations combined to exalt and adore) Might well walk in Beauty, enraptured and glad, In the smiles of their fair immortality clad! All blue were its Heav'nsâall clear was its Airâ And ten thousand enchantments and witcheries were there; But something seemed wanting to perfect the whole, It was like a fair Formâfairâbut lacking a Soul. There is one thingâall Sungifts and blue Heav'ns above, That floats round the Land like a Spirit of Love, That makes Earth one wide mantle of Sunniness wear, But that one thing, alas! it might not be found there! 'Tis the Spirit of Liberty, glorious and bright, A Spirit of Love, and a Spirit of Light; Ah! with that such sweet Land were too beauteous and fair, And the Paradise lostâwere restored to us there! A SWEET VOICE. A sweet voice, a clear voice, a soft voice, 'twas I heard, 'Twixt a whisper and warble seemed every dear word; It was soft as the Echo that haunts the lone shore, Oh! when shall I hear its low music once more! Strangeâhow strangeâthat a whisper like that should destroy All my peace, all my hopes, all my comfort and joy; The moment its sweet music first struck my ear, I felt 'twas the whisper of Fateâfull and clear! FAITHFUL LOVE. Were I borne to some purple and flowering Strand, Where fair Nature appears in her sweet unworn prime, Where the Beautiful blends with the glorious and grand, Where bright is the scenery and lovely the clime; Where cloudless and fervid shine still the clear skies, Where the beams of the sun seem more golden and bright, Aye! where Nature's rich draperies have yet lovelier dyes, And all is Enchantment, and Glory, and Light! Oh! were I now borne to so lovely a land, Would the haunts of my infancy e'er be forgot? Oh! dull were the fair clime, and bleak the bright strand, Compared with one favourite and long cherished spot. And canst thou e'er think, my Love!âcanst thou e'er think That a tie yet more sacred could ever be torn? That rent could the bond be, and shattered the link Which so long and so fondly my true Heart hath worn. Though the Brightest of Beings enchanted my sight, And the Fairest of Faces 'twas mine to beholdâ Like Natives of ParadiseâVisions of Lightâ Brightly cast in a pure and an exquisite mould. Though all Graces that charmâand all Beauty that warms To attract and to enthrall me, were radiantly met From the fairest of Facesâthe finest of Forms, Would I turn to the Loved One I ne'er can forget. Still! though others may charm for one moment the gaze, Yet, oh! yetâthough like all we deem Angels aboveâ Dim the cheek's roseate tintâdull the eye's sunny blaze, With the Memory compared of the features we love! Then fear not, Beloved One!âoh! no, never fear That the bright charms of others can win me from thee; I may smile back their smiles, but each thought, sigh, and tear, All for theeâever thineâmust unchangeably be! THE DEER OF THE FOREST. 'Twas a deer of the Forest rushed by fleet and lightâ In his fair antlered prideâin his free graceful might, And the Earth echoed not his step's fast beating rain, And mine eyes sought to follow his swift course in vain. I might scarce mark his beauteous and delicate form, As he passed like the lightning that gleams through the storm, While his eyes dark refulgence rolled, wild and more wild, As he bravely dashed by, like the whirlwind's wing'd child. 'Twas a Deer of the Forest!âI saw him again, But all ghastly with wounds and all feeble with pain; How heaved his proud chest, and how panted his sideâ Oh! where was his might and his brave fearless pride? Poor Deer of the Forest!âhow many like thee Go forth in the morningâglad, buoyant, and free, And ere night fall sore stricken, the spoiler's doomed preyâ Their strength and their joy but the tale of a day! MINSTREL FAME. Oh! a dangerous thing is Minstrel Fame, Its gifts the nothing of a nameâ And those dread crowns that twine the Lyre, Crowns wreathed of asphodel and fire! Deep are the sufferings which it brings To him who feeleth as he singsâ He who Earth's sympathy would claimâ Feeling for Feelingâfinds but Fame. Thoseâthose who trembleâthose who thrill O'er his impassioned pages, still Think of themselves, and not the Bardâ And Fame must be his cold reward. Dark is his Destinyâalas! While fast his glorious Visions pass; Too much he feelsâtoo much he knows, And strives with proud and splendid woes. Alas! he feels more than the rest, And wears deep Passion's venom'd vest, And breathes a nobler, fierier breath, To sink in one cold, common Death! ONCE! ONCE! OnceâOnceâAh! who on Earth but once must richly have been bless'd, Though now the Heart beats faintly in the sad and lonely breast; Onceâonce they revell'd in bright Hope, they nursed Joy's fairy dream, But Hopes are borne away by Timeâlike rose-leaves down a stream. Oh! the dear Once of our crushed Heartsâwhen all look'd bright belowâ The Once of our long-troubled Heartsâunfiredâunfreshened nowâ And lit but by a fevered glowâa fitful wavering Light, That doth but more recall the daysâwhen all was more than bright! Ayeâour unfiredâunfreshened Hearts!âfor sameness, dearth, and gloom, Make them in cold monotony, their own pale ghosts becomeâ No fervent hopes, no glorious dreams, to cheer these Hearts forlorn, At once they are haunted and they're loneâchilled, parched, and deeply worn. Darkâturbid, clouded, flow the streamsâLife's deep and mighty streams, Once, once so pictured o'er with Hopes, Enchantments, Triumphs, Dreamsâ Alas! Once, Onceâhow beauteouslyâhow brilliantly did Life Shine with bright Phantasms evermoreâwith every Promise rife! Once! Once!âAh, Folly, let the Soul in resignation rest, And let the deadened Heart remain unwakened in the breastâ OnceâOnce perchance more bless'd we wereâbut now we draw more near To that Eternal Home, where smiles are chased not by a tear! HAUNTS OF MY CHILDHOOD. Haunts of my ChildhoodâI retrace once more Your smiling pathsâand make them all mine own; But nowâo'er every scene so bright before, The shadows of a sorrowing heart are thrown! Allâevery thing is changedâthe flowers heaped there, Once made of Sunshine and of Beauty all, Something of gloom and dimness faintly wear, And fadeâfor me, they fade long ere they fall! The breezes that of old in Music played, In lovely Music and in loving Mirth, Now lend a heavier gloom unto the shade, Free galesâthat pierce all hidden spots of Earth! Whence comes the plaintive sadness of their tone, Each breathes some mournful message ere it partâ Methinks their mournfulness is scarce their own, Caught from the Echoes of a sighing Heart! They gladly run their fleet, far aÃ«ry race, And wake all Nature with their whispery call, And rifle every solitary place Of treasured sweets that else were wasted all! Winds! ye may pierce Earth's keyless holds, and thence Draw fragrant treasures that enshrouded lie; But to the heart, quick, fervid, and intense, Ye pierce not, save to mingle sigh with sigh! Haunts of my Childhoodâye were ever fair, But fairer still than ever now you seem, Despite the mournful gloom you faintly wear, Seen through the cloud of a departed Dream! Never hath Morning lit a spot more dear When shining forth in all her rosy grace; Nor Twilight smiledâfaint smile most like a tearâ Mysteriousâsolemnâo'er a lovelier Place. Haunts of my Childhood! ye are far more fairâ More Eloquence is from your Silence won, Because ye faintly catch and dimly wear The Shadowsâthe Echoes of a Heart undone! A FAIR SPOT. CloudsâClouds I pity ye, wing'd Clouds!âbecause ye must depart From this enchanted, lovely scene, this Temple of the Heart! How often have I envied ye, as ye shot and flew alongâ But now wing'd Clouds I pity ye, with a pity deep and strong. Say, on all your journeyings long, your breezy pilgrimages wide, Did ye ever mark a fairer spot in Spring's sweet vernal pride? In Heaven-touch'd mood, ye mourners comeâAh! hither come and kneel, Forget to doubt and grieve, yet not to loveâto loveâand feel! CloudsâClouds I pity ye, thus borne full rapidly away, Though proudly ye may shoot along in free and scornful play; But were I you, soft shadowy Cloud, that now in sight appears, I would melt down o'er this lovely spot in a shower of sparkling tears. It is a place where ever seems sweet Melancholy shrined, Yet here the Heart at once must feel both softened and resignedâ Oh! hither hasten, mourners sad! in Heav'n-touch'd mood to kneel, Forget to groan and weep, yet not to loveâto loveâand feel! COLD WORLD! Cold World! unkind thou art Unto the feeling Heartâ And leav'st it lorn and lone, Kinder thou'lt beâGrave-stone! Through rolling years, as hours, Thou'lt screen from Sun and Showersâ Through circling hours and years, Save from more wasting tears! Better thy frozen gloom, Oh! dark and dreamless Tomb! Than this World's Meteor-smiles, This World's vain, hollow wiles! Cold World! that Tomb shall yet Crush me and my regret, And turnâOh! pitying Skies! The tear-springs from mine eyes! Through rolling years and hours, 'Twill screen from outward showers; Through circling hours and years, From inward wasting tears! LIFE'S FIRST GRIEF. Oh! happy times!âOh! lovely years! When even the gush of rainbow tears Was void of wounding painâ When kindly words and gentle eyes Could rouse Affection's sympathies, And bind Love's tender chain! Too soon those seasons bright did pass, Stricken in golden youth, alas!â My heart was in its truth!â And Love grew coldâand Life grew old, And heavily its doomed hours rolledâ Stricken in golden youth! Oh! Love is full of wounding woe In this dark changeful world belowâ I joy his reign is o'er! Could I endure his sway again, This Heartâlong, long resigned to painâ Would tortured be once more! Poor Heart! so agonized before, That would'st be sacrificed once moreâ Bound to a Lot accursedâ Then hopelessâsilencedâlovelessâloneâ Remainâ'twas well to be undone By Life's first Grief and worst! I WOULD FORGET! Round me bright faces gently smile As one on me once smiledâ I would forget now for awhileâ And be awhile beguiled! Round me fair eyes all brightly shine As thine on me once shone, I would forgetâsince why repine? That I am all alone! When pleasures comeâtake pleasures still, And venomed pains resign, Oh! Heartânor strive with stubborn will To keep cold Sorrow thine! Round me young faces brightly smile (As once for me did one!) I would forget a little while That I am all alone! I would forgetâI would forgetâ Why brood o'er Life's harsh ill?â Poor Heartâthou throbbing answerest yet âI would remember still!â I HAVE ADMIRED THROUGH CIRCLING HOURS. I have admired through circling hours Thy Soul's fair gifts, thy Mind's rich powers; Butâever dearest as thou artâ I have adored thy angel heart! Thy flute-like tonesâthy star-bright smiles, Pure, artless artsâsweet, guileless wilesâ I have indeed admiredâapprovedâ But Oh!âthy meekness 'twas I loved! Let others bless those smiles so bright, Those rosy smilesâwith deep delightâ Thine eye its loveliest aspect wears For me when it shines soft through tears! Let others hail that voice so sweet, When it doth joy's light words repeatâ I love it moreâI love it most When in low broken sighs 'tis lost! Let others share thy gentle mirth, Thou best and brightest one on earthâ If my heart thy soft sadness shares, Be theirs thy smilesâthy sunshine theirs! Theirs be thy playfulness and mirth, Though these too have their own sweet worthâ Yet let those smiles on others shineâ Be but thy melancholy mine! But oh! if hallowed sadnessâsweet!â Thou shunn'st, in Youth's bright hours and fleet, Nor lov'st those deep leaves dark as death, Dim Cypress leaves 'midst Joy's fair wreathâ Oh! then be gayâBeloved, be gayâ There yet will come a cloudier dayâ When thoughtful shades shall veil that browâ Put on Joy's happiest aspect now! And I will stand aloofâand bless, Who cannot share thy happiness; Yet while Life's breath to me is given, Thy Happiness shall be my Heaven! WHEN HEARTS THAT LOVED. When Hearts that loved when smiles were bright, In seasons gay of young delight, Forgot to loveâand careless grow In times of trial and of woe; When those bright smiles are turned to sighs, Perchance thou mayest be taught to prize A pure and steadfast love like mine, That ne'er shall faulter nor decline! But if even then thou wilt refuse The love for which my fond heart sues, With others pass thy changeful hours, Or choaked with thornsâor crowned with flowers, For others smileâfor others sighâ With others liveâwith others die; And oh! be this wild prayer forgiven, Be mineâbe mine thy Love in Heaven! Then shalt thou know what Love can beâ A starry Immortalityâ A sainted feeling all divineâ Thy Love in Heaven shall still be mine! SONG. [And would'st thou have me hush these sighs] And would'st thou have me hush these sighs And dash the tear-drops from mine eyes? I know I love too muchâbut say, Should'st thou turn from that love away? And would'st thou have me laugh and smile, And glad and joyous be the whileâ Though fond anxieties and fears O'ercloud my deep and thoughtful years? And these I bear for Thee alone. Oh! mock me not with Mirth's light tone. I love too muchâtoo much I knowâ But oh, Beloved! should'st thou think so? My Heart is heavy with the Love It is so deeply doomed to prove; 'Tis crushed as by an iron band, But, lo!âI smile at thy command. It is an effort, and a taskâ But what is there that thou could'st ask And I would strive not to fulfil?â The creature of thy word and will! Forgive me if my fervent Heart, Wrapt in adoring dreams apart, Is all too full of Love's rich woe To let me Love's light homage show! And would'st thou have this heart less wild? Oh! when thou bidd'st me smile I smiled, And softened, and subdued, and still It yet shall lie if 'tis thy will! I will rebel against my doomâ My Nature strive for thee to o'ercome; For thee, mine only loveâfor thee Almost forget myself to be! THE WITHERED REED. And canst thou faithless prove indeed? What is my Love then?âwhat am I?â I am a bowed and withered reed, My love a rent and shivered tie! A withered reedâa shivered tieâ Can Life remain when all is fled? The Soul should live though dust may dieâ This Frame yet livesâthe Soul is dead! A dead Soul in a living Frameâ Oh! contradiction dark and dread; Oh! Agony without a nameâ What pangs must pierce the Living-Dead! To live this Deathâthis Life to dieâ Say, must my Fate be this indeed? Must my Love be a shivered tie, And must I be a broken reed? STRANGE IS THE POWER. Strange is the Power thou hast o'er me, And yet I love my tyrant still! My feelings may no more be free, And even my wishes serve thy will! I nothing askâI nothing hope, Save you encourage and inspire; Your frown condemns me still to droopâ Your smile relumes Hope's sinking fire! Turn not aside then that dear face, 'Tis all the Sun these eyes can see; And dark seems the Universal Space If that bless'd Sun shines not for me! And deem'st thou 'tis a worthy part To o'ercloud a Lover's trusting mindâ To crush a Lover's faithful heartâ Art thou so bigottedâso blind? So bigottedâso blind art thou As not to see Love's Heavenly Light? As still to keep cold Pride's dull vow, And turn from blissful Prospects bright? ONCE FROM GAY FOLLY'S PATHS. Once from gay Folly's paths you turned, And filled with tenderest Memories burnedâ With thoughts of Times destroyedâ Times when your heart was warm and true, And but Love's hallowed joy you knewâ To these you turned and sighed! And Hope once more played round my heart, Too ready still to take your part, And deem you pure and good; Alas! 'twas but a little while I basked in its delightful smile, Soon changed your fickle mood. Soon, soon did you relapse again, And shine the first in Folly's trainâ And I again despairedâ And darker shadows frown'd around, In chains yet heavier was I bound, And worse, far worse I fared! Go onâgo on in thy career Of Folly now, nor more appear What thou appeared'st before! Be careless stillâindifferentâvain, But be not like thyself againâ Oh, be thyself no more! All griefs but that I still can bear, And meekly bow to my Despairâ But thereâoh! there I fail; I loved so wellâthou wert so dearâ To see thee like thyself appear, Yet know thee false and frailâ Oh! that is worse than any woe Which Fortune can inflict below, 'Tis Mockery, Madness, Death! And well I feelâand know that thou Who once have broke Love's hallowed vow, Can ne'er breathe Truth's pure breath! Well, well and painfully I know That those who once can hardened grow, Must hardened still remain; Remain then thus, and never more Seem to be as thou wert beforeâ Seem like thyself again! EVENING THOUGHTS. From their wild fiery strength my thoughts subside In these soft hours of tranquil Eventide;â Deeper and deeper grows the spreading shade, Though the fair clouds are brightly still arrayed In those rich tints they ne'er again shall wear, When sets that Sun which makes them now so fair; Day shall bequeathe no gem gifts to the Nightâ She hath her own proud jewels deep and bright! I gaze with longing and admiring gaze Upon those light clouds in their ruddy blaze, Till, when I turn away at length mine eyes, The darkened Earth seems coloured like the skies, With all its lengthening shades of spreading gloom, And wears the lustre of a living bloom! So when the eye, the Vision-lighted eye, Turns inwardly to see the Pageantry And glorious show of Fancy's Pompâit views, Even when 'tis turned awayâthose beauteous hues, Stamped on Reality's hard forms, and cold, And seemeth still that glory to behold! And this soft hour of lovely Even seems The very hour of Visions and of dreams Not undelightfulâthough in sooth they wear An almost mournful tingeâyet soft and fair, (Not like the Dreams that round young Morning's throne Blaze out in dazzling splendoursâbroadâfull blown), These floating Visions that serenely rise Before the unslumbering and uncurtained eyesâ They seem with one faint hue of Beauty dyed, And yet not wholly undiversified; Each hath some separate charmâsome diff'ring grace, Like the fair stars that throng the depths of space, Which though at first with their faint silvery flame They seem to be unvaringly the same, Prove to the closer watch, the keener eye, Marked by some delicate diversity! My thoughts from their wild fiery strength subside In these calm hours of peaceful Eventide, For still a wild and fiery Strength have they, Though bowed by Disappointment and Dismay; Though Sorrow's cold Seal on my Soul is set, Her cold, cold Sealâ(and my dimmed eyes are wet With many tears)âstill they rejoicing feel A flush of Lifeâand powerâdespite that seal, Despite those tearsâand draw from Nature's store Treasures that make them worship and adore! Oh! in this World are glorious Pleasures old, Unfathomableâhidden, and untoldâ Unto the lip's weak language still unknown, Which the Heart makes and keeps still, all its own. Lyre of the Soul!âin this dull World below, The rich Strength of thy Strains none, none can know. The Bird that singeth in the echoing woods, Mingling its joy with joy of founts and floods, And leaves and windsâin all their stirring play, Sings not for Stranger Earsâby night or day, But sings unto itselfâand is at onceâ Since it nor needs assistance nor responseâ Its own orchestraâits own audience tooâ While loud it chaunts its Songs of Triumph through. Lyre of the Soul! so thine immortal Strains (The mighty language of thy Joys and Pains) Are not for Stranger senses utteredâNo! Unto thyself doth thy deep Music flow! Thy glorious Minstrelsyâuntil that time When Heaven shall echo to its sounds sublime, My thoughts! from your tempestuous strength and pride, In these soft dreamy hours of Eve subside, And gently float along in musing strain, Bound each to each, by Feeling's softest chain! MORNING THOUGHTS. Mountâmount, my thoughts!âand soar into the sky, With yon ascending lark, whose minstrelsy So charms the Emparadised and gladdened ear, A happy musicâfree, and wild, and clear. Mountâmount, my thoughtsâwith yon ascending lark, Round whom the Heavens seem openingâhark, O! hark, How gladly and victoriously he sings, While Joy and Liberty make strong his wings. Oh! how unlike yon captive in his cage, To whom each hour must seem a weary age; Poor Captive! for no crime, no fault confined, And severed from thy home and from thy kind, Thou Winged Captiveâthus more captive still Because thou feel'st the powerâthou ownest the will: And Nature gave intensely unto thee The mighty love of glorious Liberty! Those wings are worse than chains, since thou'rt debarr'd From their free useâOh! Fortune harsh and hard! All Nature gave, is torn from thee away, Child of the Air, the Cloudland, and the Day! No fair-crisp'd streams, dyed deep by Summer Evens, With all the lustre of their crimsoned Heavensâ No playful breezesâwandering lightly by With many a murmuring tone and odorous sigh, No floating clouds that in their chainless play Sail fleetly past and vanish swift away, Their various treasures offer unto thee As once, when thou like them wert glad and free. Oh! that I could unbind thee and release, And bid this harsh Captivity to cease, Then would I say to theeââBe free! depart! Amongst these clouds and breezes chainless dart, And mock their merry sport and give them chase Without a goal but Heavenâa bound but Space! Pour the clear river of thy lovely strain Through the green Woods' free Music-Seas again! Go forthâawayâdepart in joy! be free! Thou child of Light and boundless Libertyâ Mount as a Soul released from dust and Earth And bound into the freedom of thy Birth!â A MORNING WALK. Delightful 'tis in Morning's lovely hours To walk forth 'mongst the shadowy groves and bowers, And list, oh! lark, unto thy echoing strains That fall upon the soul like Summer rains Upon the earth refreshedâaye, thus they fall Freshening and kindling and awakening all That soul's world-worn emotionsâmade once more Lovely and mighty as they were before, While those sweet strains swell forth and spread and rise Those earth-electrifying melodies! How poureth forth thy rapture undefiled In storms of adoration free and wild! While the rich sunniness of youngest day Clothes all around in exquisite array, How dost thou seem in thy glad zeal to be Buoyedâstrengthened by thy joy's intensity! Oh! the sweet strains, that through the blue vault ring While thou dost proudly soar and gaily singâ The Heavenly tumult that thou mak'st of sound! The rich clear echoes that float swelling round! The multitudinous music deep and quick, Forth issuing from that little throat, whence thick And fast the notes pour out, till all the air Is shaken by their piercing sweetness rare; Thou chain'st all things with powerful melody, With silvery fetters linking Earth and Sky, When thou dost fearless and rejoicing rise Into the golden Temple of the skies, Far from the wastes and wildernesses here, The tangled wildsâthe wildernesses drearâ From the cold shadows of the Graves of Earth, And all the dimness there and all the dearth; Oh!âfreely dost thou soar and boldly range Beyond this gloomy world of Death and change, And thou canst lift into those realms above All who have sense to listenâhearts to love. Oh! Bird, how glorious is thy wond'rous power, How precious is thy privilege and dower. Thou bringest from or to the soul rich dreams, Sweet dream-like speculationsâglowing schemes And kindling phantasies that crowding rise And callest around strange shadowy companies, Shadowy but beauteousâfair ethereal throngs, Whose Heavenly lips seem joining in thy songs Thou bringest from or to the SoulâAh! there Inhabit all things glorious, all things fair; From its own wond'rous depths these visions spring, Thereâthere is hoarded every precious thing. And from the outward world, in truth, may nought More exquisiteâmore beautiful be brought Unto the Soul than lives in its own Thought! Sweet Bird, how dost thou still with zeal divine Lay thy transcendant gift on Morning's shrine! Oh! for thy thrilling throat and soaring wing, Thou fineâthou thought-electrifying thing. Oh! rather for thy free, pure, happy heart, Glad innocent adorer that thou art, And yet with thee, sweet minstrel, would I change? Ah! noâthough sometimes with despondence strange I may with thine my heavy lot compare, And mourn above the griefs I have to bear, With deep strange exultation oftener far I think how glorious even those keen griefs are; For here our very sufferings and our woe, Our origin sublime must prove and show. Cloud-landâthat exquisite Creation fair, The aÃ«rial Creation bright and rare, Triumphant Birdâthou nobly dost convert To an aÃ«rial cathedralâgirt With solemn mysteries mighty and profound, Solemn, but oh! how sweet, while wakes around A reverential sense of holier things Than this Earth knowsâdrawn from divinest springs. Triumphant Bird!âhow wond'rous is thy might Thou Sun-enkindling spark of living light! For thou dost set his dazzling Throne on fire, While thou dost like a rushing flame aspire! Burning with rapture and impassioned zeal, And teaching all things brightly how to feel. Winged Pilgrim or a shrine invisible, Thou knowest thy mystic airy path right well, And if light clouds obscure the opening day Still cloud by cloud thou trackest thy certain way, And leavest them to their breezy mirth and play, While thou dost press upon thy onward path Like one who but a sole deep object hath! Probationer of realms yet unexplored! Thou in the Heavens hast worshipped and adored, While we their great inheritors must be Content on Earth to bend the suppliant knee!â Thou might'st in ashes ev'n a spirit create, A block of adamant might'st animate! With thine impassioned and o'erpowering strains, That bind Creation up in golden chains; Those cataracts of Harmony sublime, More mighty than the Ocean's thunder-chime, Yet delicately fine, and rare, and clear, No sound of furyâand no sound of fear; Thy breezy ecstasies my Soul inspire, To wake once more a half forgotten lyre. 'Tis with keen joy and even severe delight My thoughts now join thee in thine upward flight; My heart keeps time and tune now, blessed Bird, With thy full music, felt as much as heard, And throbbing joins thy song's delicious din, Now that so deeplyâjoyously begin Thy thick precipitated notes to beat The Sea-like shadowless Blue with tumult sweet, My spirit soars in Freedom's might again, The heaviest link seems loosened of life's chain. Oh! 'tis delightful in young morning's hour To hail the proud display of Nature's power, To view her start as into sudden birth, And the out-shining Heavens, the awakening Earth, And then to join in those sweet notes of praise Which Nature's children to her Author raise. AN EVENING WALK. 'Tis sweet to walk forth in the Evening time, When Phantasies august and Dreams sublime Swell in the heart and kindle through the mind, And the half o'ershadowed Earth seems left behind, And that dim veil o'er Nature's features drawn, Permits new scenes upon the soul to dawn, Then oft that soul looks tremblingly within, With inborn horror at its inborn sin. Oh! could it, like clear streams at Even, lie And glance backâstar by starâthe whole rich sky, But in itself are darkness, clouds, and gloom, That spread like shadows of some frowning tomb; And yet at times, at these deep hours serene, It harmonizes with the harmonious scene; At times, while darkens round the world without, It kindles like a rich star brightening out, A sun-like star, that turns the shadowy Night To something lovelier than the Day's best lightâ That melts to gloryâtrembles into powerâ In Night's mysterious and congenial hour. It is in Evening's dreamy time and soft That Spirits to our Spirits seem to waft Deep messages of love and glorious cheer, That raise us high above our earthly sphere; Yet earthly things grow spiritual even Beneath the twilight-veiled religious Heaven. Each breeze hath some soft thrilling tale to tell, Each leaf is as a mystic chronicleâ Then Night flowers 'gin with gentle stealth to blow, And they too have a language soft and slow, That sinks into the heartâthe heart o'erwrought By Day with many a quick and busy thought; And Twilight's deepening now o'er Earth and Sky, And shineth forth in delicate majesty, The young clear Morn, like some bright queenly Bride In argent vesture pureâand pearled pride. Oft on the starry hosts sublime array I have gazed up with triumph-touched dismay, When in the noon of Night their splendours shine With a deep fulness almost too divineâ With triumph swelling in the silent Soul, To think that they, which ever glorious roll, Unharmed by Death and change, were yet arrayed In all their gloryâfashioned, formed, and made By the same hand that moulded our frail clay, So soon condemned to ruin and decay, So liable to accident and wrong, While glow in changeless pride that deathless throng, And with dismay o'erclouding the deep mind, To think what chains to this dull Earth still bind Earth's mortal childrenâprisonedâcheckedâconfinedâ And exiledâdarkly far, alas! how far From these resplendent realms of Sun and Star. But in the Evening's sweet and placid hour Bright thoughts are shed in many a golden shower Upon the softened Soulâpure thoughts and bright, That thrill us not with overpowering might, But with a mastery calm and deep controul The soothed, and gladdened, and consenting Soul; Not hurrying thoughts, that, while they elevate, Oppress the mindâquickâkeenâimportunateâ But such as win us from the world away, Yet lull the unquiet pulses feverish play, And still the restless workings of the brain, And chase Life's busy cares, the fond and vain, Till the outwearied Spirit, long distressed, Yields itself all to peacefulness and rest. LINES. [Ye bright, bright Stars that bind the brow of Night] Ye bright, bright Stars that bind the brow of Night As with a Victory-wreath of fulgent light; Ye full-blown Splendours of the Eternal Skies, Pure, meek, divine Infallibilities, That fall notâfail notânor can miss their way, That know not what it is to go astray. Of the Sky-ocean Music-murmuring Shells, Wherein deep harmony's own Spirit dwells; Ye worlds of immortality sublime, Our worn affections from the wastes of time, Still do ye deeply and serenely draw, And fill with admiration's richest aweâ Proud truths in glorious characters ye trace, And on an ample pageâthe unbounded Space; Unstained and inneffaceable they are, Those Heavenly Histories stamped on every Star;â Oh! let us read those histories clear and bright And steep our Souls in floods of living light! Oh! let us list to each high starry song, So shall we faint not on our journeyings long, Our journeyings long and steep, nor miss our way, Lit step by step by an immortal ray. Heaven-kindled-knowledge-kindling Stars of Night, Ye flood our souls with thoughts of strength and light, And still we hail when Heaven's Night Scene is fair, A Wilderness of worlds and wonders there, Ye glorious worlds that shine in pride and power, Ye make the noon of night, Earth's most imperial hour!â Ye bright divine Infallibilitiesâ Still teach us, guide us, prompt us from the skies! SONNET WRITTEN BY THE SEA SIDE.â1834. Ocean, thy foam-crown'd bulwarks round our Land, Thy mountain-wall of wavesâmust they be vain, To shield her from the curse, the scourge, the chain?â Shall she forget in palmy pride to stand?â Shall ruin spoil her with its red right hand? And must thy rolling ramparts, mightiest Main Prove weak to o'erwhelm her foes, or to restrain? Out upon those, the abhorred, the Unrighteous band. Alas! the Children of her bosom they Who to her heart the envenomed dagger hold, And to her lips the cup of sore dismay; By such shall England's golden days be told, Shall freedom's Land by such be bought and sold. Ocean! ere they become the traitors prey, Shroud up the Imperial Isles in thy hoar Surges old! SONNET ON THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. Honour to those who toweringly aspire, And wreak their energies on loftiest aim, Who seek to build a proud and deathless name, Nor know in steep adventure's paths to tire, August their aim, and pure their high desire. Honoured be all who urge so bright a claim, Whose spirits soar so gallantly for fame, Whose bosoms glow with such a sacred fire; But honour most to him who now at the height And summit of all proudest minds pursue, Still nobly doth his past atchievements slight, While aught of excellent remains to do; Him to whom Fame, whose flight mocks the Eagle's flight, Can bring no triumphs fresh, no honours new! STANZAS. [Wouldst thou call to my mind then, those sunny days flown] Wouldst thou call to my mind then, those sunny days flown, Wouldst thou seek to remind, too, by words and expressions, While my deep heart forgets not one thrill it hath knownâ My heart, that wild world of affections and passions. O! remind me not thusâI can never forget, But lightlyâah, lightly still touch on my sorrow, There are flowers born to fadeâthere are stars form'd to set, But they pass to give place to yet brighter to-morrow. But in Life 'tis not soâstill the bright things depart, And they leave but the dull or the painful behind, then; And we turn from the young glowing world of the heart, To dwell in the deep thoughtful world of the mind then. But spare me now, dear Oneâand let me move onâ Not fully rememberingânor wholly forgetting; Alas! when that Sun sank which once o'er me shone, How much of my Life's light set then with its setting. Away! it is over for everâ'tis done! All links have been shatteredâall sweet ties disevered, Still something, perchance, from affliction I wonâ From the bondage of breathless devotion delivered. Too muchâ'tis too muchâif in this mortal life We thus give all our souls up to passion's devotion, While we steep our Existence in sorrow and strife, And make that Existence one trance of emotion. Let the past in its own gloomy shadows lie veiled, Ah! my faint hand at least shall not seek to unshroud it; Once, once I endured, till my bursting heart failedâ Oh, Cruel! thou knew'dst it, though I ne'er avowed it. It was prideâit was doubtâ'twas despondence and fear, 'Twas the Excitement of Soulâ'twas the woman within me, That concealed every tremour, and check'd every tear, Till Love's self might not hope to confession to win me! No! I cannot forget while I live! but mayest thou Forget all that's pastâand forget I remember! Although still, shall I, ever remember as now, E'en till Life's varying Seasons wind up with December! Then seek not, I charge thee, seek not to remind, 'Twere far better to banish the vain retrospection; 'Twere far better to cast not one fond look behindâ Oh, far better to fly from regret and reflection! STANZAS. [I listen for thy steps alone] I listen for thy steps alone, I listen for thee, dearest one! With throbbing heart and straining ear, Lo! I await that step so dear. I listen for thee tremblingly, I start, I shrink, I shrink and sigh, Yet hope lives fluttering in my heart, Through every pulse, through every part. Yes, hope's delicious rapturous thrill, Wakes in mine anxious bosom still, But when that step indeed draws near, My hope is changed into a fear! Even so it is with fervent Love, Such strife the impassioned heart must prove; It longs, it hopes, it doubts, it dreads, And fast each fresh emotion spreads. Each fresh Emotion in the heart, Through every pulse, through every part, Full qÃ¹ickly wins its certain way, And makes that trembling heart its prey. Those we most Love, we most must dread Those o'er whom each fond thought is shed, For well their fearful power we know, To steep our souls in Joy or Woe. I weep, I watchâI start and shrink, And soon my throbbing pulses sink; To meet thee, Love, I may not dare, Yet how thine absence can I bear? It is a wild and wayward war, I pine for thee still when afar, And yet when thou indeed art near, My hope is changed into a fear! THE HEART. The heartâthe fervent heart, how many woes, In all their stern variety it knows; How oft it holds the most unto those things That pierce it most with keen and killing stings. The heartâthe mighty heart! how doth it cling To each long-lost, loved, sweet and precious thing, Nor knoweth to resign each cherished tie, Until it knoweth to despairâand die!â HOPE, THOU ART GONE. Hope, thou art gone, with all thy smiles and wreaths, And what is Life to me?âand what am I? Life, hour by hour, a million million deaths, But I the wretched thing that cannot die! That cannot wholly and completely die, Although a million million Deaths I prove; Each pulse a pang, each breath a bursting sighâ Oh, 'tis not Life nor Death! 'tis Love, all Love! IN THE SWEET SEASONS. In the sweet Seasons of Expectancy, How passed each fleeting sorrow swiftly by; Mine eye look forwardâforward even through tearsâ To hail the promise of new smiling years. Lightly I felt each griefâthough keenly too, But joys bright star seemed almost glimmering through, The clouds that crossed at times youth's brilliant sky In the sweet Seasons of Expectancy! MANUEL TO INEZ. Oh! tell not me of burning hearts intense That beat where Indian suns their beams dispense, Of Afric's glowing souls and bursting veinsâ The passionate natives of Numidian plains. My spirit is a wild and fiery zone, Where shines the Sun of Love on his own throne; I have a burning India, in my thought, With Passion's kindling ardours all o'erfraught; I have within my mind, clear, changeless, bright, A sultry Midsummer of cloudless light; I have a torrid Clime for my Soul's partâ And oh! a thousand Tropics at my Heart! THE LOVELY SONG. Oh! sing that lovely song once more, 'Twill make me all I was before; 'Twill raise my drooping heart and cheerâ Sing me again that song so dear. Oh! do I hear indeed again That long forgotten sweet old strain? That once my youthful ear could charm, That once my youthful heart could warm. Those lovely notes, these sweet, sweet words, How do they thrill fond Memory's chords, Till seem those tones too strangely sad, That wereâthat are so wild and glad! ART THOU CONTENT? I love thee as my soul, I love thee so That 'tis a fate, a fever, and a grief, That 'tis to me a burthen and a woe, And not to love thee, were a blest relief. I love thee as I loveâno! not my Soul, As it is tainted and debased on Earth; But as I trust, when Earth's clouds from it roll, I yet may love it, called to loftier birth! I love thee thusâoh! more, yet more, I loveâ Art thou content, sweet Ruler of my lot? Loved, worshipped, prized, adored, all things aboveâ Art thou content?âif thou art, I am not! WHY HAVE THEY TOLD ME THIS? They tell me thou hast loved me long, And I, blind fool, I knew it notâ That I have crushed with cruel wrong Thy heart, and shadowed o'er thy lot. They tell me none had ever moved That young and guileless heart before; That me alone it prized and loved, Me only, solely, did adore. That thy deep-thoughted, gentlest mind Was stored with endless dreams of me; That to my faults thou still wert blind, In me could but perfections see! They tell me thou would'st watch for hours, With breathless, speechless fondness watch; While from thine eye rained grief's dim showers, My passing shadow but to catch. That in the gay and laughing throng Thou look'dst alone for meâthough all Still followed as thou mov'dst along In beauty through the illumined hall. They tell me thisâand then, they add, Oh! dreadful blow of bitterest fate!â Oh! wordsâOh! thought to drive me mad, That they have told me this too late! That feeding on thy bright cheek now Consumption's deadly worm is seen; That faintness sits upon thy brow, And death is marked upon thy mien. And then they pity thee!âAlas!â Could I exchange my lot for thine! Oh! that with thee I now could pass To Death's dark vault and shadowy shrine! They pity thee!âAlas!âI feel That peace shall soon be gained for theeâ Oh! if they had not hearts of steel They mustâthy would more pity me! For I deserve their pity most, Who thus have stamped mine own dire fate; How utterly, how wildly lost, Heartâheartâthou sink'st beneath grief's weight! They tell me thouâso fairâso brightâ Art now so changed from what thou wert, That, oh!â'twould almost shock my sight, I feel 'twould wholly break my heart! Vain now my loveâmost wretched state!â And once I could thy heart enthrallâ Oh! since they told me this too late, Why have they told me this at all? THOU TELL'ST ME. Thou tell'st me that I love thee notâ And hast thou then indeed forgot All that for thee I have resigned?â Oh! cruelâheartlessâand unkind! This thou'st forgotten or disdained Haply because I ne'er complained; Since, oh! to give up all for thee Were worth all life's best joys for me! And deem'st thou that my love is weak Because that love I may not speak? Then thou must deem it so! for ne'er Can I disclose it or declare! 'Twere weak indeed could I impart To thee this madness of the heart! 'Twere weak, perchance, could I reveal All that for thee I felt and feel! LOVE'S SLAVERY. No Self withinâno World withoutâ Life all a shadow and a doubtâ A Riddle and a Mysteryâ SelfâLifeâthe Worldâallâonly thee. And this is mine Existence nowâ And dare I breathe this and avow? Alas! the only bliss I crave Is to remain Love's veriest slave. Let Life be still then but a doubtâ No Self withinâno World withoutâ All things I gladly can resign, So I remain Love's slave and thine. I know no other joy but this, I wish to know no other blissâ I ask of fate but still to be The slave of Loveâand oh! of thee! A CHANGEFUL LOT. The chain of my wild destiny Seems formed of opal gems to be, An endless changeâa strife of hues, Which still each other do suffuse. Still hour by hour at variance seems, A different light for ever streams From each new sun that gilds my days, Nayâdifferent even their separate rays! And yet, despite this change and strife, A light shines down upon my lifeâ A light, all strife, all change above, And oh! what can it be but Love? MANUEL'S COMPLAINT. (FROM INEZ.) The whirlwind-agonies I know Are mocked by the weak word of woeâ In the wide Earth's far-sweeping range I would with any wretch exchange, NayâI would even exchange with all, To be released from this worst thrall! Still though its doom be stamped and writ, My heart refuseth to submit! And dost thou, when I turn away From all thy consolations, say, âFull many a hapless sufferer shares Yet heavier griefsâyet deeper cares!â 'Tis not the griefsâit is the mind, In which they're bosomed and enshrined, That barbs the dart, and points the sting, And stamps the pitch of suffering; That all determines the degree Of the inly-working misery. 'Tis not the scattered thorns alone, It is the soil in which they're sown! 'Tis that which gives their rankling power To blightâto ruin in an hour. Oh! talk notâtell me not of those With sharper cares and sterner woes; Tell me of those with souls of fire, Those who but passion's breath respire; With minds of energies intense, With keenâquickâfinely-thrilling sense; With hearts all burning and o'erwrought, And Spirits with deep ardours fraught. But talk notâtell me not of those With harsher cares and heavier woes; Oh! let them give me all their care, So that they take my one Despair! Oh! let me bear their heavier part, So that they take my burning Heart! So that they pluck from out my breast This Heartâthat cannot breakânor rest! Give me their sufferings and their cares, And let my stormy soul be theirs! Then seek notâstrive not to controul The passionate movements of that Soul With those poor consolations vainâ That can but more augment my pain! Ah! no! but give mine anguish way, And let my sorrow have full swayâ The whirlwind-agonies I know Mock every other earthly woe! THE CAPRICE OF SORROW. Now would I draw my misery near And hug it to my aching breastâ Something must occupy us here, And what we dread the mostâis rest! Now would I banish it afar, And court some sweet delusion new, And enter in Life's struggling war, And fresh thorns o'er my pathway strew! Sorrow is a capricious thing, And wayward is the wounded heartâ While many moods doth Sorrow bring, That swiftly come and soon depart! Therefore it is, that changeful still, I now would crave bright Hope's return, And now would court those pangs that kill, And every brighter prospect spurn! THE SECRET OF THE SOUL. The Secret of my Soul, Beloved! thou hastâ Is that rich Secret precious unto thee? Or do I vainly, madly, weakly, waste My thoughts on one who little thinks on me? Ah! since thou hast the Secret of my Soul, Give me at least one passing thought of thineâ Since thou art Sovereign of my Being's whole, Let something of thy Spirit's love be mine! YEARS FLEET AWAY. Years fleet awayâand all things passâ And nothing is the same, alas!â New friendsânew hopesâthe world is newâ And we ourselves are altered tooâ Oh! we are altered most of all, And darker change o'er us doth fall. And this the secret heart must know, Though loath still to allow 'tis so! Yet one light wordâone fleeting word, Can touch on Memory's magic chord, And lo! our own Old World will start To life once moreâonce more to part! SONNET ON THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. (WRITTEN FOR FISHER'S DRAWING-ROOM SCRAP BOOK.) Oh! what a noble nature's stamp is there! Through these commanding featuresâthrough that eye, Shines forth a Soul, brave, generous, firm, and highâ A soul girt up to doâand steeled to bearâ Calm, principle-strengthened; free as the unchained air! On that proud forehead throned sits Victory! And on that countenance may we descry All bright expressions loftiests aspects wear. The Nation's whirlwind cry hath swelled thy name Up to Heaven's ringing heights, re-echoing round With wild shouts jubilant, and proud acclaim; But there's a still small whisper, whose faint sound To thee more precious is, I deem, than fame, Judging from that calm mienâclear, eloquent, and profound. STANZAS. [If thou art changed from what thou wert] If thou art changed from what thou wert, And if thou lovest me now no moreâ If thou canst bear so false a heart, Then all my love for thee is o'er! If thou art changedâI'm altered tooâ A mutual Infidelity! If thou art to thyself not true, Say, how can I be true to thee? If thou forget'st all precious ties And provest thyself weak, worldly, vainâ And scorn'st my sufferings and my sighs, Thy Lover can I still remain? No! no!âI loved a guileless Oneâ Kind, constant, gentle, meek, and pure; My heart's deep Love was hers alone, And oh! that Love must still endure. Still must I loveâeven more and more The Image in my Soul enshrined! Still must I cherish and adore That Idol throned within my Mind! And yet my Love for thee is o'er! My very Truth's Inconstancy! That Image pure I still adoreâ I love that stillâbut 'tis not thee! IT SHALL NOT BE. No! no! it shall not be, I will arouse me now, And set mine own soul free, And clear my clouded brow. It shall notâmust not be; I will do battle strong Against myself and thee, Dark Memoryânow ere long! It shall notâmust not be; Or if in truth it mustâ I may not live to seeâ Shrouded in senseless dust. No! no! it shall not beâ In Lifeâor Deathâ'tis o'er! From LoveâGriefâMemoryâfree, I will despair no more! SUMMER. The festal Summer comes to throw A glory o'er the Earth below; The World is changedâa radiant change, Bright, and exquisite, and strange. Young flowers do make the Earth beneathâ The air aroundâsweet with their breath; Nothing doth appear the same; A living robe of light and flame Girds the glowing Heavens around, Ten thousand rainbows stain the ground. To the most secluded spot Summer piercesâand hath shot Through the thickest twilight-woods Where a depth of shadow broods, And beneath the trees hath spread, Fresh moss and thyme for fairies' tread. Yes, festal Summer comes to throw A Glory o'er the Earth below, And light o'er our deep Hearts is thrown, And joy through our rapt Souls shed down! I LOOK FOR THEE. I look for theeâfor thee I look, And many another one appearsâ And scarce can I their gay smiles brook, While still I gaze on them through tears. For thee I lookâI look for thee, And thou comest not to cheer and blessâ Yet some men talk of constancy!â And some of Love's sweet Happiness!</field>
