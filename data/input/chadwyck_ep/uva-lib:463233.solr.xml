      <field name="fulltext">THE MUSES AND THE GRACES, BY THE hands of Orpheus Junior, doe here present this Treatise of the Golden Fleece at the Feet of the most Noble, Mightie, and hopefull King of Great Britaine. Great Monarch, though You with Apollo's lore, And with your Fathers rules are polisht more: Though You of riper Iudgements doe not want Proiectours rare, and full as elegant; Disdaine not yet to marke what we entend, And to Your Grace by Orpheus recommend. Though we no Gold, nor Precious Stones present, The value notwithstanding here is sent; King Gyges Ring to see the Cause of harmes, A New-found Fleece to rayse both Arts and Armes. Christ was wel pleas'd with the poore widowes mite; No lesse a Larke excels the greatest Kite. A little Part a wise King will preferre Of Practick Art before all Dreames, that erre. An Emperour, one of Your Name the fift Commines Bookes held as a peerelesse Gift. So did King Phillips valiant Sonne account Poore Homers Workes rich Iewels to surmount. This no Eutopia is, nor Common-wealth Which Plato faign'd. Wee bring Your Kingdomes health By true Receits; which You will rellish well, If Humours ranke by Physicke You expell. In pithy fresh Conceits Your mind may ioy, When sundry Troupes of weightie Cares annoy. In Commendation of the Golden Fleece produced by Orpheus Iunior. VVe need not now c?plaine for want of Trade, Sith fr? the West we golden wares may lade; Which Orpheus shewes in this his Golden Fleece, A Trade more rich, then Iason brought to Greece From Colchos Land; if by our slouthfull ease And wanton Peace we lose not the encrease. What I first chalkt two yeeres at Cuperts Coue, New Cambriols Planter sprung from golden-groue, Old Cambriaes Soile, vp to the Skies doth rayse. For which let Fame crown him with sacred Bayes. Iohn. Gvy. An Epigram vpon the Golden Fleece, moralized by the Authour for the good of Great BRITAINE. Orpheus but late our Woods did make to ring, And to his Harp great Charles his Carols sing. Since that he toucht vpon th' Italian shore, The New sound Politicke. Whence Boccalinies Newes of State he bore. But Orpheus now forsaking Easterne Greece, From Westerne Colchos brings the Golden Fleece; Which no Eutopia is, nor Fairy-land, Yet Colchos in Elisian Fields doth stand. Three luckie Births his Braine makes to appeare, Whereas most Creatures breed but once a yeare. Men Hercules among the Starres did put, 'Cause Hydraes triple Head He off had cut. Vnto the Spheare shall He aduanced bee? And our new Orpheus haue no high degree? Three-Monsters Heads that lops off at one blow, Errour, Vice, Want, which in our Country grow? The One foule mouthed Cerberus did quell, And chayning fast, him dragged about Hell: The Other Errour, which in Hell was bred, Hath by strong Reasons bound and Captiue led. The Augean Stables He of filth did cleanse: The Other Men, of vice and foule Offence. Th' Hesperian Apples He by waking got: But Orpheus greater Gaine doth vs allot. For which let Paris iudge, who now shall haue The Golden Apple, which the World doth craue? Stephen Berrier. In Honour of the Golden Fleece described by Orpheus Iunior. O how my heart doth leape with Ioy to heare, Our New-found Ile by Britaines prized deare! That hopefull Land, which Winters sixe I tri'd, And for our Profit meet, at full descri'd. If Hope of Fame, of quiet Life, or Gaine May kindle Flames within our minds againe: Then let vs ioyne to seeke this Golden Fleece, The like ne're came from Colchos into Greece. Orpheus remoues all Errours from the way, And how this Land shall thriue, he doth bewray. Thus ships &amp; coine increase, wh? least we thought, For Fish and Traines Exchange, and all vnbought, Iohn Mason. THE FIRST PART OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE, The verse has been extracted from prose chapters. Chapter headings are included only for those chapters that contain verse. Discouering the Errours of Religion with the remedies. Chap. I. [Since hired double Tongues grew in request] Since hired double Tongues grew in request, Nor Armes nor Arts could take their wonted Rest. Chap. IIII. [It seem'd a virgin full of liuing flame] It seem'd a virgin full of liuing flame, That would haue mou'd, if not with-held by shame So Art it selfe conceald. His Art admires. From th' Image drawes imaginarie fires, And often feeles it with his hands to try, If 'twere a Bodie or cold Iuorie. Nor could resolue. Who kissing thought it kist. He courts, embraces, wrings it by the wrist. Master Sands in Oxids Metæ. lib. 10. [He which kisses once receiu'd] He which kisses once receiu'd, Faint-hearted Gull is foule deceiu'd, If after fauours such he misse, To crop the flowre and rightly kisse. [The deuill himselfe dares not attempt that fact] The deuill himselfe dares not attempt that fact, Which the vnbridled Monke and Baud dare act. Chap. V. [A Poet by Vertues education] A Poet by Vertues education, Must chaste be in life and conuersation. But if his Verses light and wanton proue, They rellish best of Salt and gracefull loue. [The Comicke Muse makes this report] The Comicke Muse makes this report, Shee loues no more dishonest sport. For now she finds, that at her birth, She was ordain'd for harmelesse mirth. Chap. VI. [So meane perhaps, but Time brings alteration] So meane perhaps, but Time brings alteration, And a faire woman is a shrewd Temptation. [Were I disdainfull or vnkind] Were I disdainfull or vnkind, Or coy to learne, or dull of mind. But no such thing remaines in me To let mee learne my A. B. C. [Which shall I doe? or weepe, or sing?] Which shall I doe? or weepe, or sing? Neither of them will helpe mourning. The Treasure's stolne, the Thiefe is fled, And I lye bleeding in my bed. Chap. VIII. [Of late there rose a Sect of Caiphas kind] Of late there rose a Sect of Caiphas kind, Which great renowme with Pen &amp; tongue assign'd To Wedlock-bands, and with a large extent Confirm'd the same to be a Sacrament: Yet ne'rethelesse by quirks and tricks they push, As if they found a knot within a rush, Forbidding it to all the Clergy-men: A doctrine sure come from the Deuils den. But whats the fruit? Their bodies Lust inflames, That they doe burne, as scorcht in Ætnaes flames. Enamoured they wish for cruell death To end their watchfull cares, and wearied breath. Their mind runnes all on Loue. Loue moues the braine To muse vpon sweet Beauty dy'd in graine. This is the vpshot of their rash made vowes, Vnlesse the Baudy-house, which Rome allowes, Like to a Iakes, doe ease their pampred reines, Or like a Horse-leach suck their puft vp veines. Returne then, Marriage to thy free estate. Repent, yee Shauelings, ere it be too late. Vse lawfull meanes, and leaue of stolne pleasure, Account of Marriage as the Churches treasure. Christ easie yoke (yee need not stand in awe) Dissolues old vowes, and for Dianaes Law. Christs easie yoke yeelds Priests a freer life, That one man be the Husband of one wife. Chap. XIIII. [Euen as I wandred in a wro] Euen as I wandred in a wro, In a Wood beside a wall, Two Fowles saw I sit tho. The falser foule mought him befall. That one did plead on the Popes side A Griffon of a grimme stature, A Pellican withouten pride To these Lollers laid his lure: Hee mused his matter in measure: To counsell Christ euer gan he call. The Griffon shewed as sharpe as fire. But falshood foule mought him befall. The Pellican began to preach Both of mercie, and of meeknesse. And said Christ so gan vs teach, And meeke and mercifull gan blesse. The Euangelists doe beare witnesse, A Lambe he likeneth Christ ouer all, In tokening that he meekest was: Sith pride was out of Heauen fall. And so should euery Christian be Priests, Peters Successours Both humble and of low degree. And vsen none earthly honours, Neither Crowne nor curious couetours, Nor Pillour, nor other proud Pall. Nor ought to coffren vp great treasures, For falshood foule mought them befall, Priests should for no cattell pleade, But chasten them in charitee. Nor vnto battell should men leade, For enhaunsing of their owne degree. Not wilne sittings in high Sea, Nor Soueraigntie, in house, nor hall. All worldly worship defie and flee. For who so willeth Highnesse foule shall fall. Alas who may such Saints call, That wilneth weld earthly honour. As low as Lucifer such shall fall, In balefull blacknesse y builden their bowre, That eggeth the people to Errour. And maketh them to them thrall: To Christ I hold such one Traytour. As low as Lucifer shall fall. That willeth to be Kings Peeres, And higher then the Emperour. Some that were but poore Freeres, Now wolden waxe a Warriour. God is not their Gouernour, That holdeth no man his Permagall. While Couetise is their Counsellour, All such falshood mought need fall. With Pride they punish the poore, And some they sustaine with sale, Of holy Church making a Whoore. And glut their bellies with Wine and Ale, With Money they fill many a male: And chaffren Churches when they fall, And tellen the people a lewd tale. Such false faitours foule them befall. And Mitres more then one or two, Y perled as the Queenes head. A staffe of Gold and pirrie too, As heauie as it were made of lead: VVith Cloth of Gold both new and red: VVith glitter and Gold, as greene as gall. By doome they damne men to dead. All such faitours foule them befall. And Christs people proudly curse VVith broad Booke and braying Bell. To put pennies in their purse, They will sell both Heauen and Hell. And in their sentence thou wilt dwell: They willen gesse in their gay hall. And though the sooth thou of them tell, In great cursings shalt thou fall. Christs Ministers clepen they beene, And rulen all in robbery; But Antichrist they seruen cleane. Attired all in Tyranny: VVitnesse of Iohns Prophesie, That Anticrist is their Admirall, Tiffelers attired in Treacherie. All such faitours foule them fall. VVho saith that some of them may sinne, He shall be doomed to be dead. Some of them would gladly winne, Against that which God forbad. All Holy they clepen their Head, That of their Rule is Regall. Alas, that euer they eaten bread, For all such falshood will foule fall. Their Head loueth all Honour, And to be worshipped in word and deed. Kings must to him kneele and cour, To the Apostles which Christ forbad. To Popes Hests, such taken more heed, Then to keepe Christs Commandement. Of Gold and Siluer be their weed, Who hold him whole Omnipotent, He ordaineth by his Ordinance To Parish Priests a power. To another a greater aduaunce. A greater point to his mystery. But for he is Highest in Earth heere, To him reserueth he many a point. But to Christ, that hath no Peere, Reserueth he neither rib nor ioynt. So seemeth He aboue all, And Christ aboue him nothing, When he sitteth in his stall, Damneth and saueth, as him thinke. Such pride before God doth stinke. An Angell bad Iohn to him not kneele, But onely to God doe his bowing. Such willers of worship must needs fall. There was more mercy in Maximian, And in Nero, which neuer was good, Then is now in some of them, VVhen he hath on his furred Hood, They follow Christ, which shead his bloud, To Heauen, as Bucket to the wall. Such wretches be worse then wood, And all such faitours foule them fall. They maken Parsons for the penny, And of Canons their Cardinals. And Y scarce amongst them all is any, That hath not glozed the Gospell false. For Christ did neuer make Cathedrals Nor yet with him was Cardinall VVith a Red Hat, as vsen Minstrels: But falshood foule mought it befall. That say that Peter had the Key Of Heauen and Hell to haue and hold. I trow Peter tooke no Money For any mens Sinnes, which he sold. Such Successours be too bold, In winning all their wit they wrall. Their Conscience is waxen cold, And all such faitours foule them fall. Peter was neuer so great a foole, To leaue his Key with such a Lorrell, Or to take such a cursed toole: He was aduised nothing well. I trow they haue the Key of Hell, Their Master is of that place Marshall. For there they dressen them to dwell, And with false Lucifer there to fall. Christ had twelue Apostles heere; Now, say they, there may be but one That may not erre in no manner. Who loueth not this be lost each one. Peter erred: so did not Iohn: Why then is he clept the principall? Christ clept him Peter; but himselfe the Stone, All false faitours foule them befall. VVhat is Antichrist to say? But euen Christs Aduersary? Such hath now beene many a day, To Christs bidding full contrary, That from the Truth cleane vary. Out of the way they beene quite wend, And Christs people vntruly cary. God of his pittie it amend. They liue contrary to Christs life, In high pride against meeknesse. Against patience they vsen strife, And anger against sobernesse, Against wisdome wilfulnesse. To Christs words they little tend, Against measure outragiousnesse. But when God will it may amend. A token of Antichrists they be; His charactes now beene wide yknow. Receiued to preach shall no man be VVithout token of him I trow. Ech Christen Priest to preaching ow, From God aboue to them been send The Word, to all folk for to show, Sinfull man their sinnes to amend. Christ sent the poore for to preach, The Royall Rich he did not so. Now dare no poore the people teach, For Antichrist is all their Foe. Among the people he must goe, Whom he hath bid; But such suspend, Some hath he hent, and thinks yet mo. But all this God may well amend. The Emperour gaue the Pope sometime So high Lordship him about; That at the last the seely kime The proud Pope did pull him out. So of this Realme is in great doubt But, Lords beware, and them defend, For now these folk be wondrous stout. The King and Lords now this amend, Antichrist they seruen all: Who I pray you can say nay? With Antichrist such shall fall. They fellow him in deed and fay, They seruen him in rich array: To serue Christ they falsly faine. Why? at the dreadfull doomes-day Shall they not fellow him to paine? Popes, Bishops, and Cardinals, Chanons, Parsons, and Vicar In Gods Seruice I trow been false, That Sacraments sellen heere; And been as proud as Lucifere. Ech man looke whether that I lie. Who so speaketh against their power It shall be holden Heresie. The Griffon said, thou canst no good Thou neuer camst of Gentle kind Eyther I trow thou waxest wood, Or else thou hast lost thy mind. And the Pope were purely poore, Needy and nothing he had: He should be driuen from doore to doore, The wicked of him would not be dread: Of such a Head men would be sad. If the Pope and Prelates would So beg, and bid, bow, and borrow: Holy Church should stand full cold, Her seruants sit, and sup sorrow. The Pellican cast a huge cry, And said: Alas, why sayest thou so? Christ is our Head, that sits on high. Heads ought we not for to haue mo, We be his members both also. And Father he taught vs to cal him als, Masters to be called defended he tho. All other Maisters be wicked and false, That doe take maistry in his name Ghostly, all for earthly good. Kings and Lords should Lordships haue, And rule the people with mild moode Christ, for vs that shead his bloud, Bad his Priests no Mastership haue, Nor to carke for cloth, or for food. From euery mischiefe he would them saue. Their Clothing should be Righteousnesse, Their Treasure pure life should be. Charity should be their Riches: Their Lordship should be vnitee. Hope in God their Honestie: Their vessell cleane Conscience. Poore in spirit, and Humilitie Should be Holy Churches defence. The Griffon said, thou shalt abie, Thou shalt be burnt in balefull fire; And all thy Sect I shall destry. You shall be hanged by the swire. Ile cause you soone to hang and draw. VVho giueth you leaue for to preach: Or thus to speake against Gods Law? And the people thus false to teach? Thou shalt be cursed with Booke and Bell, And disseuer'd from Holy Church, And cleane y damned into Hell, Otherwise but you will worke. The Pellican said, I doe not dread. Your Cursing is of little value; Of God I hope to haue my meed, For it is falshood, which you shew. For you beene out of Charity, And would doe vengeance, as did Nero. To suffer I will ready be, I dread not that, what thou canst doe. Chap. XV. [By thy Tongues mightie Oracle.] By thy Tongues mightie Oracle. The World thou gouern'st all. On Earth thee without obstacle Of right a God wee call. THE SECOND PART OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. Chap. 3. [Why keepes one man three Offices alone] Why keepes one man three Offices alone, Another yet deseruing more, hath none? Eyther the Starres shoot out some crooked rayes, On this low world, or Fortune on it playes. Or else the Ayry Prince this busines guides: For surely God more equally diuides. More Offices then one, 'tis great pitty. That any in Countrey hold or Citty. One Charge, and yet I am no puritan, Will serue one man, and that a carefull man. Graces and Muses twelue in number are; Which for their Troupes looke equally to share. A Prince had need to marke, and well to know, On whom he doth great Offices bestow. In Horses race men looke into the Sires. Like Crow like Egge. The gracious Grace inspires. Sith with the Parents seed their manners slow, And in the Sonnes deriu'd by Birth due grow, Why doe some Lawyers prey on Labours hires, This Lesson they haue conn'd from Clownish Sires. Those Clowns their Sires, which hating Heau?ly right, Them from their Birth defil'd with Earths delight. Whereby their Sonnes so trained vp at first, By natures kinde commit that act accurst. Tis seldome seene, that one of Noble Race, Peruerts Tribunall Seates by trickes so base. Tis seldome seene that one of Noble bloud, Betrayes his King, or sels his Countries good. If one among a thousand such you finde, Some Treacher him seduced of Clownish kind. If any Lawyers play the Tyrants part, Thundring out fines, to make the vertuous smart, Or proue notorious for deceit and bribes, They are descended of base Clownish Tribes. Nothing more base then is the Ruling Clowne, Not Antichrist for fraud can put him downe. No change of manners, though he change his weed, He what his father wore, doth neuer heed. Whiles that such Moles in nought but Earth delight, They snort in ease, and snatch at others right. Nobles like Planets moue with noble thought. A Royall Virgin forth our Sauiour brought. The Commons should be rul'd, the Nobles rule, Lawes rule them both, as Bits the Horse and mule. Peeres plac't in Office, by their peerelesse King, Are iust, least blots they to their Honour bring. The vulgar Sort fit for Mechanick Trade, May helpe their country with the Plough and Spade. Chap. 4.

Chap. 5. [There is a time of earnest things to write] There is a time of earnest things to write, A time to talke of matters small &amp; light, A time to walk, to run, to ride, or praunce, A time to sit and laugh, or lead a Daunce. There is a time for men to fast and pray, And so a time to sing like Birds in May. Chap. VII. [Tis honour great abroad to settle peace] Tis honour great abroad to settle peace, But greater farre our countries broyles t'appease. Towards the Next true Loue must first begin. High things I begge. From iars defend Gods Kin. Though mangled we, you may vnite vs all, If you reforme the subtill pleading Hall. The Lawyer maskt with Law on vs doth feed. Few men escape. The Niggard stands in need. [King Iohn his Crowne did to the Pope expose] King Iohn his Crowne did to the Pope expose, Which, as you saw, poore Luther durst oppose. Both Skies and Seas with sundry motions rage; Yet now is come Astreaes Golden Age. A King of Denmarks Bloud Lawes out of ioynt, As there in written Bookes here shall appoint. None then shal wrest, as would K. Iames ordaine, A secret Law hatcht in one Lawyers braine. If he offend for Bribes, Fraud, or Delay, Twere fit that Noblemen or Bishops may Iudge him, where he shal not preuaile with gold, With Friendship, quirks, Demurres, nor facing bold. What differs it to see a Tyrant rule? Or a rau'nous Iudge riding on his Mule? A King may keepe his daring Foes in awe, With lesser charge then men doe spend in Law. Chap. VIII. [One's thunder strooke, Another's grac't amaine.] One's thunder strooke, Another's grac't amaine. The cause the same. Such is the force of Gaine. Without deare coine, the Lawyer sayes but mum: Yet when it sounds, the lawes th?selues are d?be. The tongue vowes hope, his mind losse. Doues turn'd Aspes. Sweet hony gall. How ill Loue Hatred claspes! Chap. IX. [Bright Light of Loue, which knowest the Originals] Bright Light of Loue, which knowest the Originals, And Principles of Supernaturals, Which measur'st Globes, &amp; the 7. w?dring Spheares, Inspire my heart. Let not subrustick Feares, Nor bashfulnesse of Virgins crimson hew Astonish me from speaking what is true; But that with free and lofty voice I sound Sweet Peace, which may strife, and not Lawes, confound. Doues build in holes of Rockes: but thou, my Doue, In holes of bloudied Rocke must build thy Loue. My Soule, like to a Doue with silver wings, Flies to Christ's wounds for feare of Vipers stings. He is my Rocke, my Sauiour, and Defence, While I stand cloth'd in Robes of innocence. Hee knowes my aime is faire, jarres to subdue And Charitie in Lawyers to renew. Some thinke it a hard taske, impossible; But unto God all things are possible. Others subiect mens fraile intelligence, And Reformations to Starres Influence: As though Errours waite on Reuolutions, Bald times pleasure, or Constellations. First, let th? learne; although the Suns cleere beames With his pale Sister, Lady of the streames, Doe rule the World, and worke in Trees and Flowers, Yet can they not controule Diuiner Powers, Such as our Spirits be, nor yet our wits, Which Policie refines with sacred Writs. Who can deny, but Craft's the cause of Euill? As Truth will shame Promooters and the Deuill? As Vnitie and Iustice I adore, So these turn'd topsie turuy I deplore. Of Old it was not so. Then, no Surmizes Could wrest Lawes, nor Pleas maskt in disguises. Few Sentences then served to unfold Great matters. Then they pleaded not for Gold; But eu'ry man in person to the Iudge, As vnto God, his Case shew'd without grudge. This made them quiet, and stor'd with Treasure, Where we spend, attending Misers leasure. We spend our Thrift, our Braines, and precious times By lewd mens counsels fild with heynous crimes In needlesse Suits, whom they hold for Clients, Or Tenants, like greedy Leaches Patients. Through thicke and thinne vp to the eares and chin, They make vs drudge to bring them mony in. But what's the end? Their Heires do seldom thriue. Although in Pomps their aged Starlings liue, And sucking Pidgeons bloud turne Cormorants: Yet neuer Apes will grow to Elephants; Nor will God suffer an Impostors Race To flourish long, nor wisdome, to embrace. Some Nations He plagues for their Drunkennesse With bloudy warres; some for their Beastlinesse With Famine of his Word. But vs He smites By letting double Tongues, vse base despites. Then friske like Foxes brisk, and squeak like Rats; Or barke like Curres, or caterwaule like Cats. Feare no thornes, lift vp your hornes; each Brother, Like juggling Gypsies, deceiue another. This man rake, him to the stake; hold your owne. Cheat kindly, my Maisters; There's Gold in Towne. By Hook or by Crook, by Right or by Wrong Cramme Purses with Curses. O dismall Song! All's Fish that comes to Net in Sea or Brooke. No surer angling then the Golden Hooke. Glad is false Iudas of his siluer pouch; Glad is fond Midas of his golden Touch, As Whales doe play vpon the lesser Fish, Till Harping-irons spoyle their latest wish; So These wound Christ againe through Neighbours sides, Till Earth deuoures her due, their hideous hides. O curuæ in terras Animæ Cœlestium inanes! O stooping Soules to Earthly trumperies, And quite deuoid of Heauenly Mysteries! Chap. XII. [Beware of Physicke mixt by Romish brood] Beware of Physicke mixt by Romish brood, Whom Mariane taught to let great Princes bloud. By Lopez learne by poyson hir'd to kill, What mind those haue a Christians bloud to spill. Tobacco, late which men haue brought fr? Spain, Is thought to taint the bloud, heart, lungs, &amp; brain. The Iesuits this teach, as a point of merit, To murther some, and Heauen to inherit. Lust creepes and Theft by opportunitie. Then cheere not Æsops Snake with iollitie. Chap. XI. [It matters not so much to weare the Horne] It matters not so much to weare the Horne, If that it might be free from others scorne. Hornes haue no cure, but when thy selfe art sped, To graffe those Hornes vpon anothers head. [Woe to thee, Tarleton, that euer thou wert borne] Woe to thee, Tarleton, that euer thou wert borne, Thy Wife hath made thee a Cuckold, and thou must weare the Horne, What and if she hath? Am I a whit the worse? She keeps me like a Gentleman with mony in my Purse. [O those faire starlike eyes of thine, one sayes] O those faire starlike eyes of thine, one sayes, When to my seeming she hath lookt nine wayes. And that sweet breath, when I thinke out upon it It would blast a flowre, if she breathed on it. Withers in his Satyrs. Chap. XII. [Who doth desire that chast his Wife should be] Sir Philip Sidney. Who doth desire that chast his Wife should be, First, be he true, for Truth doth Truth deserue. Then be he such as she his worth may see, And one man still credit with her preserue. Not toying kind, nor toyishly unkind: Not stirring thoughts, nor yet denying right: Nor spying faults, nor in plaine Errours blind: Neuer hard hand, nor euer reines too light: As farre from want, as farre from vaine expence: The one doth force, the latter doth entice. Allow good Company, but keepe from thence, All filthy mouthes, that glory in their vice. This done thou hast no more, but leaue the rest Vnto thy Fortune, time, and womans brest. Sir Iohn Harrington. Concerning wiues take this a certaine Rule, That if at first you let her haue the rule, Your selfe at length with her shall beare no rule, Except you let her euermore to rule. Yet in the house, as busie as a Bee, I am content my Wife sting all but me. Sir Thomas Ouerbery. O rather let me loue, then be in loue; So let me chuse as Wife and Friend to find. Let me forget her Sexe, when I approue. Beasts liknesse lies in shape, but ours in mind. Our Soules no Sexes haue. Their Loue is cleane. No Sexe, both in the better part are men. Domestick Charge doth best that Sex befit Contiguous businesse so to fixe the mind. That leasure space for fancies not admit. Their leisure tis corrupteth woman-kind Else being plast from many vices free, They had to Heau'n a shorter cut then we. Womens behauiour is a surer barre, Then is their No. That fairely doth deny Without denying; thereby kept they are Safe eu'n from hope. In part too blame is shee Which hath without Consent beene onely tride. He comes too neere that comes to be denide. Ariosto. Like a true Turtle with thine owne Doue stay, Else others twixt thy sheets may falsly play. If thou wilt haue her loue and honour thee, First, let her thine Affections largely see. What shee doth for thee kindly that respect, And shew how thou her loue dost well affect. Remember she is neighbour to thy heart, And not thy slaue: shee is thy better part. Thinke tis enough that her thou mighst command: Whilest she in Marriage bonds doth loyall stand, Although thy power thou neuer doe approue, For thats the way to make her leaue to loue. To goe to Feasts and Weddings 'mongst the Best, Tis not amisse: for their suspect is least. Nor is it meet that shee the Church refraine, Sith there is vertue, and her Noble Traine. [A puling Female Creature, which hath smiles] A puling Female Creature, which hath smiles Like Sirens Songs, and teares like Crocodiles. [As Mothers are, so will the Daughters be] As Mothers are, so will the Daughters be: Chast was Susannaes Mother, chaste was she. Baals Miracles she from her Cradle knew, As how vaines Tombes with Idols to eschew, She honour'd Abram, Moses, and the Saints; But vnto God she framed her Complaints. Bad Company she shunn'd, as Rockie shelues, And fear'd suspected Suiters worse then Elues. If Flesh and Bloud in her began to tickle, She mortified her thoughts, that were so fickle. She fasted oft, but oftner vs'd to pray; To which she ioyn'd some labour eu'ry day. No Day without a Line. She daily wrought, Somtimes on Needle, when she fitting thought. Or spunne by Distaffe, or the Wheele she rowld, Somtimes on Loome, her skil she would vnfold. At times she stirr'd more busie then the Bee, And was well pleas'd the Maids to ouer-see. Tir'd with houshold busines on Harp she playes Or Violl, which she tunes to Dauids Layes. One while she sings for her recreation. Of Noahs Arke, and the first Creation. Another whiles of Ægypts Miracles, Her Nation blest with Sinaes Oracles; Their wandring forty yeeres with Manna fed, And in the Desert by an Angell led. Now of their Wars she tels with warbling voice, Anon of Iewries fall with dolefull noyse. One while she reades, another while she writes; She writes those rules, which she herself endites. Some other time, to draw the Countries Aire, She went abroad, but neuer to a Faire. Least, Tortoiselike cub'd vp; shee might take harme, She goes abroad to see her Fathers Farme. The Fields shee likes, but more the Garden walkes, To note Gods workes in seedes, herbes, flowres, and stalkes, Yea, &amp; though seldome, she the Towne suruayes With her deere Mother witnesse of her wayes. Chap. XIIII. [What at this day doe Brittaines Tongues bewray?] What at this day doe Brittaines Tongues bewray? That by strong liquor some haue gone astray. Faiths Temple they pollute with Cup and Can, In Duties fayling towards God and Man. They spend their wealth, spoile their health, mar their wits By drinking more then sober men befits. Thus haue our bordring Dutchmen lately swill'd, Vntill their Pots with Neighbours bloud are fill'd, Repent, be wise in time by others harmes; Flie witching Cups for feare of after-harmes. If not: your King your Tauernes must destroy, Least suffring Sinne himselfe doe feele annoy. Chap. XV. [Three hundred thousand pounds yee yearely spend] Three hundred thousand pounds yee yearely spend In hastning griefes vnto a deadly end. Yee need not Hellebore. Tobaccoes fume From Court and Cottage wil expell the rheume. Alas fond Fooles! which spend your meanes and health, With Sathans ioy, and hurt to Common-wealth. Why come not in your Foes to doe you harme? The English faint, if they but heare Alarme. When Humors quaile, the Spirits moue but dul, When Subiects faile, th' Exchequer is not full. Let them, that loue the Smoake, fall with the smell. Tis true, Tobacconists; why do yee swell With anger at the truth? Ere seuen yeeres end Tobacco will the banefull force extend. It breeds a wheezing in a narrow breast, The Hecktick Feuer, or thick Fleame at least. A bastard heat within the veines it leaues, Which spoyles the Infant, if the Wife conceiues. Yet sipt with Hysops iuyce, or held in mouth, Or snuft, it cures the Lungs, and Tisickes growth. Chap. XVII.

THE THIRD PART OF The Golden Fleece. Chap. 11. [In ancient times they vsed much to Fast] In ancient times they vsed much to Fast, And what was spar'd they turn'd to Almes at last: But we the Sabbaths make Saturnall Feasts: On Holy dayes Drinke makes some worse then beasts. If men did Custome pay for Ale and Beere, Great Charles then Spaines King Philip richer were. Our blood's inflam'd: Diseases grow by Wine: Our Barnes waxe lesse: The Poore doe grone and pine. Chap. 12. [I long to sing of Charles his Waine] S?. Dauid. I long to sing of Charles his Waine, And with due praise to raise The Flowre deluce of Charle-le-maine. New dayes bring forth new Layes. O happy Starre! O hopefull daies! Braue Iasons Golden Age! Kinde Courtiers, heare S. Dauids Layes, Free from wiles, farre from rage. Who Cambriaes Ioyes then Cambers Son, Should for this match expresse? This match, whose Beames doe strike vpon Towers, Fields, and Wildernesse? Scoggins interruption. What wilt thou proue a Phaeton? Stand backe, and doe not presse: Among our wits a Coridon, Thy selfe a Swaine confesse. Base is thy tune, so seemes thy state In Courtlie Eagles eyes; None may come in at heauens Gate Without S. Peters Keyes. Without great meanes none out of Wales Shall greete our Noble King. Dar'st thou then come with Newfound tales? And them before him sing? Thy Cambria is a barren land For Goates and Satyres fram'd: Like to the Alpes, or that wild Strand, Which thou hast Cambrioll nam'd: Thy Nation meete to be still gull'd With Lawyers quirks and quips: Thy Muse vnholy, too much dull'd, No drop of life she sips. No Wedding Robe, hast thou on, Foole, Yet look'st here wedding Cheere: A Guest vnbid must bring his Stoole; Stand backe and draw not neere. S?. Dauid. Stand backe thy selfe, thou greedy Elfe, Shall Slugges the Hauen hold? And merry Greekes runne on a Shelfe From Colchos bearing Gold? Both Sea and Land in league conspire Rich Cambrioll to deface, If Argonautickes thou aspire To keepe from Courtly Grace. O how thy Midriffe swelles with Gall Against an Antient Race! Wee are no Slaues, true Britaines all May see his Highnesse face. If Cats may looke vpon a King, And Curres barke at the Moone: Arcadian Swaines like Swannes may sing, And Dauy begge one Boone. That Dauid which made Pagans bow To Christ, though Fiends repine. That man which made Polagians know Their faults, and truth to shine: That name, which through Great Britaines Land The first of March doth ring: If not; the fame of Newfound land Shall lead me to our King: Whose Heart I faine with Orpheus straine Would cheere; and then salute The Queene, which Fates for him ordaine With Violl and the Lute. The sacred Muses sent me heere, And, if Might quells not Right, I will draw neere, (O doe not ieere) The Light, their Angels sight. To whom Ile show what's yet vnshowne, My Countries griefe and neede; And in thy eare (although a Clowne) Ile whisper through a Reed. Our Cambria is a fertile soile Abounding with all store; Else would not her Hells-brokers spoile, And sucke her blood so sore. Had Cambria not more Drones then need, Her shoares would yeeld good ships: Her Land more wealth, where now we feed With honey needlesse lips. Till Hydra suits bee well restraind, Our Iarres will neuer cease: Our meanes grow meane, our honour stain'd, Voyd of Grace, voyd of peace. But if our King play Hercules, And daunt them with his Mace: Old Cambria shall with Cumbers lesse Sustaine new Cambriols case. And both together Tribute pay More store then Peru's Oare, Which at his feete they'll yearely lay, With some in hand before. S. George did kill, as Legends say, A Dragon fierce of prey: Next vnder God this Monster may None but our Soueraigne slay. Marke well my words, whose Pedegree Is fetch't from Cambers line; And with our Leekes who do'st agree Thy Roses to Combine. Take wares vnbought, a thing that's strange, Fish, Iron, Salt, and Pitch, Trayne, Skinnes, and Masts: or in Exchange Fruit, Wine, Gold, Silkes most rich. Our Seuerne goes not farre behinde The Thames for fruitfull ground: Nor this my Muse shall any finde Vnrelisht or vnsound. Let Friends or Fiends, or Momes accurst Taxe her for want of life: With sweet the best, with sowre the worst She payes to end the strife. I'st not folly? and vnholy For Bayards to discerne Of doubtfull colours suddenly, Before the right they learne? Although I am no Puritane, Pure kisses I commend. Pure iests I praise in any man, So they to goodnesse tend. I haue not read, I must confesse, Those bookes cald Lutherane: And thine, O Wickliffe, haue I lesse; Yet am not I profane. These Mysteries I leaue to such, Who pale with study teach: Or vnto such, whom ouermuch Wants Feare commands to preach. Skeltons interruption. Why dost thou smite, O busie wight, Our eares with thy discourse? Art thou a Iew, or Rome-a-Night, A bruitish Turke, or worse? Thy Song some Welsh Sidanens Loue May gaine to thy desire: But Courtly Dames will thee reproue, Fly from high beauties fire. Haunt thou Bride-Cakes, and Country cheere As fits a Cambrian Peere. Thy Mumsimus, thy murmurs here None will but dizzards heare. Bray there aloud, and roare complete Amidst thy Pipes and Ale: From Babels seat springs thy conceit, Thy sonnet is so stale. S. Dauid. I come not here for Belly-cheere, Nor for Tobaccoes fume. With mirth for mirrh my Soueraigne deare, To perfume, I presume. Whom mighty Ioue meanes to destroy, He lets them quaffe a while: And mads them with a smoaky toy, Themselues till they beguile. Bayte thou those Beasts: and Ile take leaue, To greet our Charles his waine: Whose rayes shoot on, as I conceaue, The stocke of Charle le-maine. Their Starre I saw from Cambria West: Which made me Gifts prepare, Leekes crownd with Pearles; yet to contest Against me still you dare. You gape for Fees, but a Gold Ring Suits not a Meazells snout. A Lambe shall wring your Adders sting And canuase all your rout. Rather then you should terme me Iew, Leane Bacon I will eat: Or Pudding nere so blacke of hew, or Hare, though beauties meat. But if you please and stand precise, Vpon those Iewish Lawes: Your double tongue Ile Circumcise, Which marres your Clyents cause. I worship not false Mahomet, Who barres the Ivy signe, As ignorant, how some haue met In wine the sisters nine. Nor Romes good will seeke I to winne, Which orders me to plow Red furrowes vp in naked skinne, And merits seed to sow. Such Grace let Popes graue on themselues, And leaue me as I am; Who brookes it worse then Egypts Elues The Diuell, or his Dam. I count that Church Baudes Pedlery, Which all for money cares; Sells Masses, Pardons, Letchery, Soules, Beads. ô precious wares! Though lack a dandy, when he houles, Frights children from the dugges: Will men giue bribes to keepe their soules From Purgatories bugges? Though Apes weare coates, and some birds prate, Not knowing weale from woe: Yet sober men (though somewhat late) Owles Mattins should forgoe. I hunt not for more miracles, The Gospell to confirme: Nor outward shewes, Gulls Spectacles, To hold my Inside firme. The Golden Calfe old Iewes averr'd With manly voice to crake: Christs body some are not afeard, From Gods right hand to rake: I like as ill the Cloister life, Vnlesse a Nunne I schoole. Let him that hates an honest wife Be gelt, or beg'd a foole. No Priest shall cozen me to fast To pull my courage downe, If once of Shrift my Wife had tast, Or lou'd a grasse-greene gowne. At Tombes and Shrines I dare not call, On Saints this match to guide: Nor Heauens Queene; let Idolls all Lye from this mariage wide. But vnto ONE, that's alway prone To pardon humane vice, I vow them both in Christ alone A liuing Sacrifice. The Stony-heart who can deny But vnion tender makes? Of diffring Tunes an Harmony, In spight of Hellish Snakes? No venome shall their soules defile, No dreames, no magicke spells: Nor Crocodile tempt them with guile. So sweet Loues Posie smells! No Beast shall touch their honey flowres, No flashing curse them sindge, What God hath set he weedes at houres; Gods knot let none infringe. With Oile of Gladnesse, Bathes of blisse Dipt shines free Maiestie In Albions Throne, where Thamesis Extolls their Amitie. The Crownes they weare, no Fiends can teare; S. Michaell guards his owne. The Golden Scepter which they beare With Lawes swayes Field and Towne. With might &amp; maine their mind contends The Dragon to put by, Who red with blood at last intends The westerne Monarchy. Yet let him reckon with his Oast For his warre-fares wages: Not all his Rents in Indiaes Coast Will pay th' arrerages. Let none wonder, if God Thunder Vengeance for our Iarres: While we vnder Sathan wander, Himselfe with Dauid warres. But reconcil'd he wils to fight His Battells valiantly. Though Dauids might Goliah slight, On God all Conquests lye. Couragious King, then bid vs smite Tyrants downe, Gyants growne; Downe with those Dons, which Britaines spight, Tara tantara downe. Me thinkes Lisbon I see now wonne, Th' Iles ransack't, th' Indies sack't, And sweet Eliza thought vndone; Rein-stald by vs awakt. In March, like Iune, their springs first light Reuiues our Garden beds With louely Roses, red and white, And Leekes with siluer'd heads. The Spirits Gardner will keepe greene With Buddes perpetually, Our Rosie King and Lillies Queene, On him if we relye. Whom last I pray, as Pageants gay, As Maskes, or Gemmes in Gold, My Muse to prize, though clad in gray, My Will, though too too bold. The conclusion of Orpheus Iunior to his Soueraigne the King of Great Britaine. If with kind words your Maiestie approue This Golden Fleece sprung from a subiects loue: Ile sweare you hold your Fathers worth by right, That from your lippes there shootes a quickning light. But if your mind more waighty cares withdraw, One fingers touch sufficeth me for Law. Ile dreame that you haue read, what I present, Or deem'd it meet for wisedomes Parliament, Or else Ile faine new fancies in my Braine, That to your state this worke might bring some gaine: Or that you doe of Vaughan well conceaue, But to your Cookes this as a prey you leaue: I care not, whilst crown'd Lillies you become, While Trade helpes Armes abroad, and Peace at home.
