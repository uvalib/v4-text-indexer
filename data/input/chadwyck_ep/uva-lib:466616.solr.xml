      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, TO LIEUT. COLONEL SIR AUGUSTUS S. FRAZER, K.C.B. &amp; F.R.S. COMMANDING THE ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY IN FRANCE. The din of arms hath ceas'd:âand as of yore The Knight, returning from war's wild uproar, Doff'd his plum'd helm, and, in the banner'd hall, Hanging his broad shield on the blazon'd wall, Exchang'd, well pleas'd, the trumpet's hoarser bray For the old Minstrel's rude and simple lay;â Thus could I wish that poetry of mine Might lend a charm to vacant hours of thine. And though, unlike the Harper's loftier song, Mine win no plaudits from a listening throng, It hath not flow'd in vain, if it beguile Thee of one weary hour, or Emma of one smile. Feb. 16th, 1818. THE VALLEY OF FERN. There is a lone valley, few charms it can number, Compar'd with the lovely glens north of the Tweed; No mountains enclose it where morning mists slumber, And it never hath echoed the shepherd's soft reed. No streamlet of crystal, its rocky banks laving, Flows through it, delighting the ear and the eye; On its sides no proud forests, their foliage waving, Meet the gales of the Autumn or Summer winds' sigh. Yet by me it is priz'd, and full dearly I love it, And oft my steps thither I pensively turn; It has silence within, Heaven's proud arch above it, And my fancy has nam'd it the Valley of Fern. O deep the repose which its calm recess giveth! And no music can equal its silence to me; When broken, 'tis only to prove something liveth, By the note of the sky-lark, or hum of the bee. On its sides the green fern to the breeze gently bending, With a few stunted trees, meet the wandering eye; Or the furze and the broom their bright blossoms extending, With the braken's soft verdure delightfully vie.â These are all it can boast; yet when Fancy is dreaming, Her visions, which Poets can only discern, Come crowding around, in unearthly light beaming, And invest with bright beauty the Valley of Fern. Sweet Valley! in seasons of grief and dejection, I have sought in thy bosom a shelter from care; And have found in my musings a bond of connexion With thy landscape so peaceful, and all that was there: In the verdure that sooth'd, in the flowers that brighten'd, In the blackbird's soft note, in the hum of the bee, I found something that lull'd, and insensibly lighten'd, And felt grateful and tranquil while gazing on thee. Yes! moments there are, when mute nature is willing To teach, would proud man but be humble and learn; When her sights and her sounds on the heart-strings are thrilling; And this I have felt in the Valley of Fern. For the bright chain of being, though widely extended, Unites all its parts in one beautiful whole; In which Grandeur and Grace are enchantingly blended, Of which GOD is the Centre, the Light, and the Soul! And holy the hope is, and sweet the sensation, Which this feeling of union in solitude brings; It gives silence a voiceâand to calm contemplation, Unseals the pure fountain whence happiness springs. Then Nature, most lov'd in her loneliest recesses, Unveils her fair features, and softens her stern; And spreads, like that Being who bounteously blesses, For her votary a feast in the Valley of Fern. And at times in its confines companionless straying, Pure thoughts born in stillness have pass'd through my mind; And the spirit within, their blest impulse obeying, Hath soar'd from this world on the wings of the wind:â The pure sky above, and the still scene around me, To the eye which survey'd them no clear image brought; But my soul seem'd entranc'd in the vision which bound me, As by magical spell, to the beings of thought! And to Him, their dread Author! the Fountain of Feeling! I have bow'd, while my heart seem'd within me to burn; And my spirit, contrited, for mercy appealing, Hath call'd on his name in the Valley of Fern. Farewell, lovely Valley!âwhen Earth's silent bosom Shall hold him who loves thee, thy beauties shall live;â And thy turf's em'rald tint, and thy broom's yellow blossom, Unto loiterers like him soothing pleasure may give. As brightly shall morning, thy graces investing With light, and with life, wake thy inmates from sleep; And as softly the moon, in still loveliness resting, To gaze on thy charms, thy lone landscape shall steep. Then, should friend of the bard, who hath paid with his praises The pleasure thou'st yielded, e'er seek thy sojourn, Should one tear for his sake fill the eye while it gazes, It may fall unreprov'd, in the Valley of Fern. VERSES, ADDRESSED TO WM. WORDSWORTH, ESQ. BEING A PARODY ON THE STANZAS PREFIXED TO THE âWHITE DOE.â There was a time, with spirits light and gay, When simple marvels pleas'd my young desire; Then, Wordsworth, in thy page from day to day, I found that rapture youthful minds require; And, with my elder Sister, o'er thy lay Ponder'd, beside our quiet parlour fire:â Still finding in thy legendary store, Some tale which oftener read, but pleas'd the more. Then unto virtue pleasing was the smart, And the tear precious in compassion shed, For her, who pierc'd by Poverty's keen dart, Did meekly bear the taunts unmerited, Utter'd by Harry Gill; until her heart Found vent in supplication, short and dread; Awfully mighty in her impotence, Trusting to One above for her defence. Visions I saw, call'd forth by magic spell; With fairy prospects were thy pages fraught; 'Till o'er the landscape chilling darkness fell;â And I was by cold, rigid critics taught That all my favourite lays were, (truth to tell) By reason scorn'd, by manhood reckon'd nought:â And thus was train'd to think, with fancied pride, Thy once lov'd page to childish lore allied. To me thy stream of fiction ceas'd to flow; To me thy matchless melody was mute; Awhile seduc'd by bards of loftier show, I sought 'mid flaunting flowers for richer fruit; But 'twas not their's such banquet to bestow:â So I desisted from the vain pursuit, And turn'd once more to share with thee, content, The blameless fruit of fancies innocent. It sooth'd me, it beguil'd me then to hear Thy Wanderer's pious, pure, and lofty strain, Address'd to him, who, losing all held dear, Retir'd from busy life as full of pain, Of pain unmingled;âwith attentive ear I heard that pensive moralist explain The Christian's comfort in Affliction's hour, With all the Poet's, and the Prophet's power. Then too thy Village Pastor's tales could please; Tales told of those now lull'd in dreamless sleep; Their trials past, their humble destinies, Gathering fresh interest from each grassy heap; Wakening with every tale those sympathies, Which in the inmost heart their dwelling keep; And link the loftiest to the lowliest doom, Alike the mouldering tenants of the tomb! Then could the tragic tale of Norton's fate Please and instruct; and o'er the mournful page, Which pictur'd that fair lady and her mate, Roving the earth in helpless pilgrimage; I hung delighted; pleas'd to contemplate Scenes which have rous'd a critic's harmless rage: But sweet to gentler readers, who would bless A happy hour with holier happiness. He serves the Muses erringly and ill, Whose aim is pleasure, light and fugitive; Wordsworth! 'tis thine the mandate to fulfil Which GOD and Nature to the Poet give; 'Tis thine with magic might, and syren skill, To bid our better feelings wake and live:â And for this cause thy hallow'd Muse shall claim Now, and while time shall last, enduring fame! MADAME LAVALETTE. Let Edinburgh critics o'erwhelm with their praises, Their Madame de Stael, and their fam'd L'Espinasse, Like a meteor at best proud Philosophy blazes, And the fame of a wit is as brittle as glass. But cheering the beam, and unfading the splendor, Of thy torch, wedded Love! and it never has yet Shone with lustre more holy, more pure, or more tender, Than it sheds on the name of the fair Lavalette. Then fill high the wine-cup! e'en Virtue shall bless it, And hallow the goblet which foams to her name; The warm lip of Beauty shall piously press it, And Hymen shall honour the pledge to her fame. To the health of the Woman, who freedom and life too Has risked for her husband, we'll pay the just debt; And hail with applauses the heroine and wife too, The constant, the noble, the fair Lavalette. Her foes have awarded in impotent malice, To their captive a doom which all Europe abhors; And turns from the slaves of the priest-haunted palace, While those who replac'd them there, blush for their cause. But in ages to come, when the blood-tarnished glory Of Dukes and of Marshals in darkness hath set; Hearts shall throb, eyes shall glisten, at reading the story Of the fond self-devotion of fair Lavalette. ON THE DEATH OF LABEDOYÃRE. Farewell, gallant Soldier! and peace to thy slumbers! Though nameless, thy tomb long remember'd shall be; Thou diedst as a traitor, and yet there are numbers Who shar'd in thy treason, unquestion'd, and free. Thy treason! say rather, thy patriot ardour!â It was love of thy country occasion'd thy fall; And thy fruitless endeavours to save and to guard her, Should lead every patriot to honour thy pall. Then think not, bold youth! when survivors shall name thee. That their cheek the base flush of dishonour shall wear; They appreciate thy motives too justly to blame thee, And are proud of the memory of brave LabedoyÃ¨re. No, thou art not with rebels and traitors confounded By the brave, the impartial, the wise, or the good; They saw treason with rank and with splendour surrounded, Impatient for vengeance, and thirsting for blood. They saw those who had clamour'd against usurpation; Combining in Priestcraft's and Tyranny's cause, Turn usurpers themselves; and, with just execration, They branded such,âtraitors to Liberty's laws:â But for thee, noble youth! and thy glory untarnish'd, The patriot and freeman breath'd many a prayer, Nor can flagrant injustice, though plausibly varnish'd, E'er sully the fame of the brave LabedoyÃ¨re. Farewell, gallant soldier! the country that bore thee May stoop to the yoke which her victors assign; Unhallow'd by priests be the turf which rests o'er thee, And tyrants decree their own rights are divine. But if France be not lost to all sense of true glory, If her sons yet are men whom no dangers appal; Whoever shall live to recount her strange story, Will proclaim the proud vengeance she took for her fall. Then, then in the hour when Freedom shall rally, When freemen indignant for combat prepare; Shall resound o'er each mountain, each mead, and each valley, The name of the martyr'd, the brave LabedoyÃ¨re. STANZAS, TO HER WHO CAN BEST UNDERSTAND THEM. Be it soâwe part for everâ Let the past as nothing be;â Had I only loved theeânever Thou hadst been thus dear to me. Had I lov'dâand thus been slighted, That I better could have borne; Love is quell'd, when unrequited, By the rising throbs of scorn. Pride may cool what passion heated; Time will tame the wayward will; But the heart in Friendship cheated, Throbs with woe's most madd'ning thrill. Had I lov'dâI now might hate theeâ In that hatred solace seek; Might exult to execrate thee, And in words my vengeance wreak. Butâthere is a silent sorrow, Which can find no vent in speech; Which disdains relief to borrow From the heights that verse can reach. Like a clankless chain enthralling; Like the sleepless dreams which mock; Like the frigid ice-drops falling, From the surf-surrounded rock;â Such the cold and sickening feeling Thou hast caus'd this heart to know; Stabb'd the deeper, by concealing From the world its bitter woe. Once it fondlyâproudly deem'd thee All that fancy's self could paint; Once it honour'd and esteem'd thee, As its idol and its saint. More than woman thou wast to me; Not as man I look'd on thee; Why like woman then undo me? Why heap man's worst curse on me? Wast thou but a fiend, assuming Friendship's smile, and woman's art? In thy borrow'd beauty blooming, Trifling with a trusting heart?â If soâwherefore should we sunder? Hast thou not my nature chang'd? Then regard me not with wonder, Through despair with demons rang'd! By that eye, which once could glisten With approving glance on me;â By that ear, which once could listen To each tale I told to thee;â By that lip, its smile bestowing, Which could soften sorrow's gush;â By that cheek once brightly glowing With pure friendship's well-feign'd blush;â By all these false charms united Thou hast wrought thy wanton will; And without compunction blighted, Though thou wouldst not kindly kill. Yet, I curse thee not:âin sadness, Still I feel how dear thou wert; And I would not, e'en in madness, Doom thee to thy just desert. Liveâand when my life is over, Should thy own be lengthen'd long, Thou mayst then too late discover By thy feelings, all my wrong. When thy beauties all are faded; When thy flatterers fawn no more; Ere the solemn shroud hath shaded Some regardless reptile's store; Ere that hourâfalse Syren! hear me;â Thou mayst feel what I do now; While my spirit, hovering near thee, Whispers friendship's broken vow. But 'tis useless to upbraid thee What thou wastâmy fancy made thee; What thou artâI know too late. THE DOUGLAS. I thought, when I saw her, of days when the standard Of Douglas wav'd high o'er the fields of the North; When the Slogan's The gathering cry of a clan. dread yell, both from borough and landward, To the âbloody heart'sâ The standard of the Douglas family. aid call'd her veterans forth. I thought of the days when fierce Archibald flourish'd, And bearded his minions to Royalty's face; Or exil'd, and outlaw'd, in solitude nourish'd, With spirit unbending, the pride of his race. With those dreams of the past, were by fancy connected, Scenes grand and terrific as Rosa might draw; Deep glens, cloud-capt mountains, and clansmen collected At the hest of the chieftain, whose word was their law. In fancy I saw the dread war-cross uprearing, Heard the shout of the vassals to conquer or die; Belted plaids, and blue bonnets, by hundreds appearing, And the target and claymore uplifted on high. Such the sights and the sounds, which, in chivalrous glory Rose bright to my vision on viewing the fair; But short time I gaz'd, ere the poet's proud story, With the splendors it usher'd, had melted in air! 'Twas a Douglas I own; and she might be descended From the haughtiest and bravest recorded of yore; But in her gentle glance were expressively blended Emotions which pleas'd and enchanted me more. 'Twas the kind glance of pity, so tenderly beaming Like the sun through a cloud on a chill April morn; Or like moonlight's meek smile, on a wintry lake gleaming, Which softens the landscape, else drear and forlorn. And thus look'd the Douglas, when hunger appealing To charity's aid, rais'd its uplifted eye; Though trivial the pittance, 'twas given with feeling, And for that feeling's sake stands recorded on high. Nor would I the bliss of the moment have barter'd, So dear is the pleasure compassion can yield, For all the bright visions which fancy uncharter'd Hath painted of Douglas in camp or in field. For thee, lovely Girl, who hast won from a stranger This tribute of praise;âblessings rest on thy head! May God be thy guardian through grief and through danger, And angels watch over the path thou shalt tread! The throbs of compassion still carefully cherish, As pledges of good to thy youthful heart given; Nor shall they with youth's cloudless happiness perish, But keep that heart pure for the visits of heaven! TO MY PEARL SNUFF-BOX. Memento of moments recurr'd to with pleasure; Of hours when fancy and friendship were free; Deposit most dear of a snuff-taker's treasure; Thou shalt not pass unsung or unhonour'd by me. Though nonsensical nicety dirty may deem thee, And finical folly survey thee with scorn, As a friend and companion I love and esteem thee; Like the rose in thy perfume, but lacking its thorn. And more to my partial taste to endear thee, Thou wast given me by one, whose remembrance must blend With my thoughts when I touch, and I feel when thou'rt near me, Thou'rt a talisman to put me in mind of a friend. But thy beauties alone might well purchase the praises Of a muse more melodious, more lofty than mine; For each way I turn thee, the eye, while it gazes, Sees varying shades on thy surface combine;â Now white as the wing of the dove is thy whiteness, Anon thou art yellowish, bluish, or green; One minute thou'rt dull; the next beaming with brightness, Like a light fleecy cloud is thy silvery sheen:â Fair Flora has fondly and sportively crown'd thee, With trophies engraven her triumphs to tell; Plutus provided the rim that runs round thee; And Neptune or Thetis has furnish'd thy shell. Combining such charms, and containing a treasure, Which the noseless or nerveless alone can disdain: I regard thee with feelings of pride and of pleasure, And at every fresh pinch I could praise thee again. Thou and I, though but recently known to each other, Are pledg'd not to sever âtill death us do part;â And we'll jog on together, as brother with brother, For I cannot but love thee, mere toy as thou art;â Why should I not love thee, and crown thee with laurel? Thou'rt a friend whom no censure or slander can touch, Ever prompt to give pleasure, too quiet to quarrel; Of how few amongst men can the Muse say as much! TO A DAISY. Meek mute memorial of that power, Who decks fair Summer's brightest bower With every lovely hue; Thus early venturing forth alone, Ere Winter's wildest blasts have blown, Accept, what justly is thine own, A tribute fond as true. Not in the blythe and budding Spring, When thousand flowers are blossoming All brightly in the sun; Can they, combin'd, afford to me The train of thoughts thou bring'st with thee;â Nor can they touch the tender key Of feeling, thou hast done. No, no! the very lavishness Of Nature, by its own excess, Cheapens the chaste delight, Which I admire and love thee for;â Since thou hast no competitor, No flaunting rival, to withdraw From thee our partial sight. In lonely loveliness and pride, Without one flowret by thy side, Thou brav'st bleak Winter's wrath; There's not one green leaf in the grove, But every branch is bare above, And wither'd leaves, as on I rove, Are scatter'd o'er my path. In that cold cheerless nook of thine Scarce can a struggling sunbeam shine, If such should venture forth; And when that wintry sun's last beam Hath shed its glimmering, transient gleam; The chill, cold moon, I scarce can deem Will recompense thy worth. Well may thy doubtful destiny Prompt pensive, boding thoughts in me, Thou frail and feeble elf; Beholding, in this lot of thine, Much similarity to mine, I can but view thee as a sign, And symbol of myself. Thus, thirty years and more ago, Into this world of varied woe, And on this very day; I, like thyself, a stranger came, Unconscious of a thought or aim, Which innocence might blush to name, Or virtue to betray. Like thee I was not born to shine; For humble was my lot, as thine; As shelter'd and obscure; But I have learnt, and thou mayst yet, Ere thrice yon Winter's sun is set, That all which lives incurs a debt Of misery, stern and sure. No nook so narrow, lot so low, Where man can flourish, flower can grow, Secure in happiness;â Mental or elemental strife, With ruthless desolation rife, Or soon, or late, will teach that life Is doom'd to wretchedness. Yet thou mayst boast, sweet transient Star! A happier doom than man's by far;â Thou reck'st not of thy doom:â Thou op'st thy bosom with delight, 'Mid wither'd leaves a spot of white;â Heedless how soon the chilling blight May blast thy transient bloom. Provided thou canst live thy hour, Thou hast no careâO happy flower! Were but man's lot like thine! Could he, like thee, no future dread; But know, that when his leaf was shed, With life, all hope and fear were fled, He need not then repine. But he as frail, less fair than thou, If doom'd, alas! to suffer now, Woes known to few or none;â And having suffer'd deeply here, Is haunted by that dreadful fear Which whispers to the Spirit's ear Of sufferings but begun! STANZAS, TO A LADY, WHO PROMISED THE AUTHOR TO SUBSCRIBE, IF IT WERE WITH HER LAST GUINEA. Thanks, Lady! for no one can surely deny Such a Patroness justly may claim them; And, the hopes of the Bard all his doubts may defy, When a promise like this comes to shame them. 'Tis not that the poet such language could take In its vulgar and literal meaning; 'Twould be paltry to throw for so precious a stake, And to lucre be servilely leaning. Nor should I that promise, so playful, have prized As a matter-of-fact declaration; But had I its spirit and meaning despised, It must have disgrac'd my vocation. It meant nothing more then, than, out of that hoard, On which some for its own sake had doated; Of those guineas which merely for trifles were stored, The last should to song be devoted. Then, thanks to thee, Lady! as fitting and fair; And beshrew the base churl who refuses To echo her praise, who from trifles will spare One guinea to give to the Muses! LINES, WRITTEN PREVIOUSLY TO THE PUBLICATION OF LALLA ROOKH. Sunshine and moonshine, by hook or by crook; With bowers and flowers, and many a brook; Fairy regions which never were dreamt of by Cook; Rosy lips, rosy cheeks too, and tresses, which shook By the amorous breezes, enchantingly look; With bright eyes which glance into every nook, Speaking language which might even puzzle Horne Tooke, If Purley his spirit from Pluto could hook;â In short you can't guess what you'll find in the book, Which Tom Moore has written, and call'd Lalla Rookh! TO THE GALLIC EAGLE. Fame's favorite minion! The theme of her story; How quail'd is thy pinion, How sullied its glory:â Where blood flow'd like water, Exulting it bore thee! Destruction and slaughter Behind and before thee. Where glory was blushing, Thy flight was the fleetest; Where death's sleep was hushing, Thy slumber was sweetest. When broad swords were clashing, Thy cry was the loudest; When deep they were gashing, Thy plume was the proudest. But,âtriumph is over;â No longer victorious;â No more shalt thou hover, Destructively glorious! Far from the battle's shock, Fate hath fast bound thee; Chain'd to the rugged rock, Waves warring round thee. Instead of the trumpet's sound, Sea-birds are shrieking;â Hoarse on thy rampart's bound, Billows are breaking. The standards which led thee Are trampled and torn now; The flatteries which fed thee, Are turn'd into scorn now. For ensigns unfurling, Like sunbeams in brightness; Are crested waves curling, Like snow-wreaths in whiteness. No sycophants mock thee With dreams of dominion; But rude tempests rock thee, And ruffle thy pinion. Thy last flight is taken, Hope leaves thee for ever; And victory shall waken Thy proud spirit,ânever! âTHEY TELL ME, LOVE, THOU'RT SLEEPING.â They tell me, Love, thou'rt sleeping In peace among the dead;â And cold night dews are steeping The green grass o'er thy head. It may be so;âand yet, Love,â While thought is fond and free, Remembrance and regret, Love, Turn tenderly to thee. They tell me, Love, thou hearest Nor sigh nor prayer of mine; That he, who once was dearest, Is now no longer thine:â And what if it be so,âLove, Can it improve my lot? Or lull my grief, to know, Love, That thou regard'st it not? O no, Love! let me think then Thy spirit holds me dear:â Nor shall I wholly sink, when I fancy thou art near. O thou! who wast while living My life's most lovely star;â In gloomy seasons giving Fresh brightness from afar:â How can I hopeless-hearted, Conceive that lovely light For ever hath departed, And set in endless night? No, no, my Love! 'tis near still; And in this world of woe, Its gentle beauties cheer still My path with twilight's glow. Nor would I, Love, surrender The bright and glorious boon Of its declining splendor,â For any other's noon! SONNET TO THE DEBEN. Thou hast thrown aside thy summer loveliness:â And those who sought thy banks are well content To spend at home in social merriment Their wintry day; no loitering footsteps press Thy cheerless border; yet I must confess I love thee still; and think an hour well spent In walking by thee; for thy winter dress To many a lonely hour a charm hath lent.â Instead of summer's sun; and rippling tide, Flowing so softly that it seem'd to creep In silence to thy banks; are now descried Dark gathering clouds; and o'er thy bosom sweep The wintry winds, until thou seemst to be To fancy's eye some little inland sea. STANZAS FOR MUSIC. The following Verses were written for a Benefit Concert, given on behalf of a Blind Performer. Spirit of Music! if from regions, where Sweet sounds, and hallow'd harps invite thy stay, We may invoke thee hither;âO, repair! And o'er our listening souls thy sceptre sway. Thine are the animating tones that thrill The chords of feeling, and the soul of sense; Whose potent power, and more than syren skill, Can rouse to passion, melt to penitence. And thine those fairy sounds, which, as they float In sportive playfulness that mocks control, Bear mirth on every laughter-loving note, And through the enraptur'd ear enchant the soul. Spirit of Music! &amp;c. How happy is he, to whom nature has granted To gaze on the glories which round him she spreads; On the foliage of forests her right hand has planted, Or gardens all gay with the beauties she sheds. When the rose in the sunbeams of morning is blushing, And shines through the dew-drops, like beauty in tears, He can gaze on her charms;âand, where fountains are gushing, He beholds in its brightness the streamlet that cheers. When Night in her radiance new worlds is revealing, He can lift up his eyes where those beams brightly blend; And O! above all, he can feast on the feeling, Which flows through the heart at the sight of a friend. Though fountains that gush, And roses that blush, Unseen and unheeded may be; Though the forest's dark gloom, And the garden's rich bloom, Unveil not their beauties to me. Though planets on high, Which spangle the sky, Unknown and unnotic'd may shine; And I know not the face Of the friend I embrace, Yet many sweet pleasures are mine. For I have long learnt to distinguish so clearly The accents which fall from the lips of a friend; That few can imagine how softly and dearly, Through my ear, to my heart, those lov'd accents descend. And none can conceive, but the blind who have tasted The bliss which my bosom now gratefully shares; How the magic of melody, too often wasted On the senses of others, can steal upon theirs. Spirit of Music! can thy votary be Unblest, while wakeful to thy sweetest notes, Which hover round him, breathing fresh from thee, While Echo on each dying murmur dotes? No, no, while love of thee around him brings A group like this; O! let him fancy still, He hears the fluttering of thy fairy wings; And drink the dear delights those sounds distil. For pure and sweet, as is the crystal stream; Soft as the sigh of love, when love is new; Delightful as the poet's morning dream; Thy empire isâsweet Spirit, then adieu! âTHE HEAVEN WAS CLOUDLESS.â The heaven was cloudless,âthe ocean was calm, For the breeze which blew o'er it scarce ruffled its breast; Not a sight, not a sound, that might waken alarm, Could the eye or the ear of the wand'rer molest. As I roam'd on the beach, to my memory rose The bliss I had tasted in moments gone by; When my soul could rejoice in a scene of repose, And my spirit exult in an unclouded sky. I thought of the past;âand while thinking, thy name Came uncall'd to my lips, but no language it found; Yet my heart felt how dear, and how hallow'd its claim, I could think, though my tongue dare not utter a sound. I did not forget how with thee I had paced On the shore I now trodâand how pleasant it seem'd; How my eye then sought thine, and how gladly it traced Every glance of affection which mildly it beam'd. The beginning and end of our loves were before me;â And both touch'd a chord of the tenderest tone; For thy spirit, then near, shed its influence o'er me, And told me that still thou wert truly my own. YesâI thought at the moment,âhow dear was the thought! That there still was a union which death could not break; And if with some sorrow the feeling was fraught, Yet even that sorrow was sweet for thy sake. Thus musing on thee,âevery object around Seem'd to borrow thy sweetness to make itself dear;â Each murmuring wave reach'd the shore with a sound As soft as the tone of thy voice to my ear. The lights and the shades on the surface of ocean Seem'd to give back the glimpses of feeling and grace Which once so expressively told each emotion Of thy innocent heart, as I gaz'd on thy face. And, when I look'd up to the beautiful sky, So cloudless and calm;âO, it harmoniz'd well With the gentle expression which spoke in thy eye, Ere the curtain of death on its loveliness fell! How proud is the prize which thy virtues have won, When their memory alone is so precious to me, That this world cannot give, what my soul would not shun, If it tore from my breast the remembrance of thee! TO THE STAR OF THE LEGION OF HONOUR. A PARODY. Star of Napoleon! wont to shed False glory round thy master's head; Thou radiant, but abhorr'd deceit, Which millions rush'd in arms to greet; Wild meteor of infernal birth! Rising from hell to set on earth! Souls of the murder'd form'd thy rays; And Nature shudder'd at thy blaze; The discord of thy frenzied sphere In groans vibrated on the ear; And thy light shone on human eyes, Like a volcano of the skies. Like lava roll'd thy stream of blood! And swept down empires in its flood. Earth shook, and tempests veil'd the sky, What time thy fiery orb roll'd by; And the bright star of peace suspended Her lustre, till thy course was ended. Around thee in thy orbit roll'd A halo, dreadful to behold; Three various tints, as emblems true, Combin'd in its portentous hue; For tyrant power had gather'd them, As fit thy lurid orb to gem. For one the hue of carnage dyed; One with splenetic vapours vied; One was a sickly, dingy white, Symbol too just of pallid fright:â The three, so mingled, did beseem The phantoms of a feverish dream. Star of Napoleon! thou hast set, And paid offended Freedom's debt. That circling halo, too, is gone, Which round thee in thy glory shone. Sweet Star of Peace, unveil thy light, Our tears and blood have wept thy night. O Freedom! bless its rising dawn, And usher in a glorious morn. For worshippers of Peace are they, Who most adore thy hallow'd ray; And may we, goddess! ever be Blest with the smiles of her, and thee! STANZAS, ON THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. Farewell to the hopes which the Nation hath cherish'd! To the visions of glory,ânow vanish'd in gloom! To the prospects which dawn'd,âand for ever have perish'd! To the feelings we foster'd,ânow chill'd in their bloom! The oak of our Fathers, which once flourish'd proudly, And struck deep its roots, and its branches spread wide; Which listen'd unmov'd, when the tempest roar'd loudly, No longer exults in its prosperous pride. Its stem, struck by lightning, hath long since been shiver'd; All its earliest boughs of their beauty been shorn;â And Fate's stern decree hath to death now deliver'd The last sapling shoot which wav'd bright in the morn! Not with lingering decline, or by gentle gradation, Did its loveliness wither, its leaves drop away;â At sunset it seem'd all secure in its station, And was torn from its stem ere the dawning of day! Butâadieu to such images!âours is a sorrow, Which can find in no image of fiction relief; And the depth of its anguish forbids us to borrow From the Bard's brightest fancies a balm for our grief. No! Charlotteâwe need not be taught to deplore thee By the poet's warm page, or the orator's arts; For the high hopes of thousands, who now sorrow o'er thee, Have been long turn'd to Thee in their innermost hearts. There are those who, at seasons, with fond expectation, To the future look'd forward: and fanciedâin Thee Might yet be fulfill'd every wish of a Nation, Both generous and faithful, both loyal and free. And well does each bosom's high-throbbing emotion Refute the base cant of the sycophant slave, Who would brand, as deficient in loyal devotion, An empire which mourns o'er thy premature grave. But it is not as Britons and Patriots only That we publicly grieve:âother feelings must glow In the hearts of the lovely, the lov'd, and the lonely; And thoughts the most tender our nature can know. O! many a Mother, but yesterday folding Her lov'd infant close to her bosom with joy, Believ'd with delightâher own cherub beholding, That such would, ere long, be thy blissful employ. But now! while the drops in her gentle eyes glisten, From the babe on her breast, for one moment forgot, She looks silently up, with reluctance to listen To the faltering tongue which relates thy sad lot. Farewell!âand when History, telling thy story To Britons unborn, shall thy destiny speak, They may turn from the record of grandeur and glory, With a sigh on each heart, and a tear on each cheek. And those of this age, while on earth they outlive thee, Shall, deeply regretting thy too early doom, With feelings of anguish that pure homage give thee, Which retires from the Throneâto repose on the Tomb! HAUNTS OF CHILDHOOD. âO long be my heart with such memories fill'd! Like the vase in which roses have once been distill'd; You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will, But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.â Moore. Who has not known and felt the soothing charm Of looking back to hours, so clear and calm, They seem as if they scarce were spent on earth, But ow'd to mere imagination birth? He most enjoys them, who in childhood slighted Their present bliss;âwhose eager eye delighted The shadowy joys of future years to scan, And sigh'd, most foolishly, to be a man! We need not sleep to dream.âI was not sleeping; But busy memory was her vigils keeping; And on my mind past images were thronging, Bringing those feelings to the past belonging; They came so thick about me, that at last, I fairly lost the present in the past; And, for a time, a happy boy again, I lost in memory's pleasure, manhood's pain. I stroll'd along a winding lane: a stream Flow'd on one side of it; the sun's bright beam Was here and there reflected, gaily glancing, As o'er its pebbly bed that brook was dancing: Sometimes, so narrow were its banks, the eye Could scarcely trace it in its revelry; Half hid by stunted bushes, on it flow'd; Now still, now murmuring sweetly on its road:â A wooden bridge then cross'd it, and I stood Awhile upon that bridge in pensive mood, To look around me. Straight before me rose A house, where all was hush'd in calm repose; For 'twas a summer morning, bright and fair, And none of human kind were near me there: Before the house there were some lofty trees, Whose topmost branches felt the morning breeze, And glisten'd in the sunbeams; these among Were numerous rooks, attending on their young, Whose clamorous cawings, as they hover'd round, Seem'd to my ear like Music's sweetest sound. Below, before the house, there was a space, Where in two rows were set, with bloomy grace, Orange and lemon trees; which to the sun Open'd their fragrant blossoms every one; And round them bees all busily were humming, Cheerily to their morning labours coming:â And in the centre of each space beside, An aloe spread its prickly leaves with pride. Now in the garden of that house I stray'd, Its flowers, its mossy turf, its walks survey'd; Explor'd each nook, and roam'd through each recess, With pleasure, and light-hearted carelessness: Nor was it long before I found a walk Where I could think, or to myself could talk;â A grassy walk, with lime trees on one side, Bordering a pond which yet they did not hide; For here and there upon its rippling bosom The water lily op'd her dewy blossom; And at the end of this sweet walk I found A grotto, where I listen'd to the sound Of turtle-doves, which in a room above, Were tremulously telling tales of love. But wherefore dwell upon these recollections, These hallow'd haunts of childhood's warm affections? Why? but because they rise with wings of healing, And hover round me; softly, sweetly stealing Its bitterest pang from pain, its sting from sorrow, And from past blessedness fresh blessings borrow. O! ere such dreams as these for ever leave me, Or manhood of such blameless bliss bereave me; Memory, and life itself, must both be past, For while I live, at times, must their remembrance last. TO THE MEMORY OF PETER GEDGE, ESQ. LATE EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF THE BURY AND NORWICH POST. When a prince, or a peer, to the grave hath descended, We hear with distrust the bard's eloquent song; Unconscious how far baser feelings are blended With those which to virtuous bosoms belong. When a friend, warmly lov'd, from this world hath departed, The eulogiums of friendship indulgence may claim; Yet with caution, which some may consider cold-hearted, We pause, ere we deem them decisive of fame. But when worth, which has undergone party's ordeal, Comes out of its furnace like gold from the fire; We cannot refuse to confess it is real;â We respect and esteem; we must love and admire. And such was thy worth, unto whom my muse raises This humble memorial thy virtues have won; Unpurchas'd at least, and untainted by phrases Of fulsome applause, which thy spirit would shun. May thy children yet shed on the name they inherit That lustre which birth-right alone cannot give; And be monuments still of thy memory and merit, That long in our eyes and our hearts thou mayst live. And may she, who, with feelings of pride and of sorrow, Oft recurs to the character thou hast bequeath'd; From its brightness a balm to her widow'd heart borrow, And forgive him whose verse with thy name is enwreath'd. SONNET, ADDRESSED TO ARTHUR BIDDELL, OF PLAYFORD, WITH A COPY OF THE FOREGOING. Accept, dear Arthur, for its subject's sake, This tribute to the name of one well known To thee;âto me by character alone. Stern Death with mortals stoops not terms to make, But does his errand;âyet he cannot take By his strong arm, however mighty shown, What boasts a power superior to his own, Thoughts which the silent dead alone can wake. And thus our better feelings, those on which True friendship feeds; although they may be rent, Will still endure; and livingly enrich The heart, by raising in some secret niche A sacred, soul-solacing monument To those with whom our happiest hours are spent. INTRODUCTORY VERSES TO THE TRIUMPH OF THE ORWELL; A BALLAD, WRITTEN TO COMMEMORATE THE LAUNCH OF THE ORWELL INDIAMAN. Daughters of Orwell! you to whom The stream I sing hath long been known; Who prize its banks when Spring's gay bloom In lavish loveliness is shown;â Or Summer's radiance rests upon Its breast, with bright and dazzling beam; Or Autumn's tints, of tenderer tone, Along its borders richly gleam:â By whom but you should Orwell's praise Be welcom'd with indulgent ear? From whom should minstrel, who essays To tell its triumphs, hope to hear Those plaudits, to the Poet dear, But You?âthen while the strain I wake, With favouring smiles vouchsafe to hear, Not for my own, but Orwell's sake. So may you, many a future Spring, Behold its beauteous banks supplied With renovated charms, which bring Admiring strangers to its side. Or when the Summer's fervid pride Invites you on its waves to sail; Be it yours to skim its flowing tide With sky serene, and gentle gale. Or if mild Autumn's mellow eve Should lure you on its banks to stray, Just when the sun is taking leave, And sheds aslant his softest ray On groves, and gardens, late so gay, Where varying tints still richly shine, And pensive gleams of brightness play, Attendant on the day's decline;â Then in that calm and peaceful hour, May you with chasten'd feelings bless The dear delight, the silent power. Of Nature's fading loveliness! And gazing, gratefully confess In voiceless extasy, how dear,â Far dearer than the gay can guess,â The parting glories of the year. Nor think such feelings will expire When wintry storms obscure the sky; No: oft beside the social fire Shall Memory bring them to your eye; And lonelier hours glide swiftly by, Beguil'd by those which sped before them,â Fancy shall make you feel them nigh, And Hope shall whisper, âI'll restore them.â FINIS.</field>
