Iacob. 4. [As I laye musing in my bedde alone] As I laye musing in my bedde alone My pyllowe remouinge. For slepe was gone So troubled was my spirite by greuous agonye Consideryng the state and staye of our beleue The ofte chaunging therof christen hartes doth greue Which standeth in no staye, it is the more pitie God geue vs grace our lyues to amende And true fayth in Englande agayne sende For lacke of grace we haue gone astraye Ensuing the steppes of wickednes alwaye Our soules and bodyes by synne is corrupted The thinges that of olde to God was begonne We fondely agayne haue them fordonne The badde for the good vnsemely placed Experience hath taught vs it is well knowen That euil men haue reped, that good men haue sowen Genes. 3.When Adam dyd lyue with Eue his wyfe The serpent begonne to sowe some stryfe Betwene our lorde and the soule of man Perswadyng the woman of the appell to eate Promysyng her wysedome therby to gette Where sinne was vnknow?, there then it began Thus by the breakyng of Gods c?maundement Mans soule was caught captyue by death to shent Genes. 9.When Abell and Cayne fyrst dyd begynne Of their fruites to offer y? then were growinge On the earth to the lorde in worthy sacrifyce Cayn slewe Abell there in that stede With the Iawe bone of an Asse as we reade Because the lorde dyd hys oblation despyse, When oblation and sacrifice here first beganne The deuill set stryfe betwene man and man As the people beganne to encrease in number, With vnclennes theyr soules they dyd inc?ber Genes. 6. 7.

Leuit. 9. Matth. 5. All creatures from the earth by glage or otherwise Then aultares was vsed as the bokes doth tel Of the Leuites, patriarkes, prophetes, &amp; gospel The Aungell to Abram from the lorde was sent That Isaac his sonne in sacrifice should present Genes. 10. Unto the lorde for so was his wyll Abram then stode not this message to reason But went with his sonne wyth all expedition Unto the mounte there Isaac to kyll To sacrifice his sonne, Abram was content As the lorde him selfe had geuen c?maundem?t Here maye you se thoughe some will prate The aulter and sacrifice was not deuised of late As the stories olde dothe truely tell 1. Regum. 1.When Hanna the baren dyd fast and praye And sacrifice to the lord as the storye doth saye He gaue hyr a sonne, that hyte Samuell With prayer and oblation God was pleased The troubled hart, he therfore hath eased Ionas.When the Citezins of Niniue wickedly did liue Ionas was sent them warning to geue Within fortye dayes there subuersion to be The Kyng in all the hast, sent commaundement then That all shoulde repent, both woman and man Their clothes not rendinge but their hartes inwardely Thus by repentaunce, the Citie was saued By prayer and fastynge, their paynes released 2.
