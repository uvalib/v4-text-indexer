ADVOCATE. Thy muse may tell, how, when at evening's close, To meet her love beneath the twilight shade, O'er many a broom-clad brae and heathy glade, In merry mood the village maiden goes: There, on a streamlet's margin as she lies, Chaunting some carol till her swain appears, With visage deadly pale, in pensive guise, Beneath a wither'd fir his form he rears! Shrieking and sad, she bends her speedy flight, When, mid dire heaths, where flits the taper blue, The whilst the moon sheds dim a sickly light, The airy funeral meets her blasted view! When trembling, weak, she gains her cottage low, Where magpies scatter notes of presage wide, Some one shall tell, while tears in torrents flow, That, just when twilight dimm'd the green hill's side, Far in his lonely sheil her hapless shepherd died. Let these sad strains to lighter sounds give place! Bid thy brisk viol warble measures gay; For see! recall'd by thy resistless lay, Once more the Brownie shews his honest face. Hail, from thy wanderings long, my much lov'd sprite! Thou friend, thou lover of the lowly, hail! Tell in what realms thou sport'st thy merry night, Trail'st the long mop, or whirl'st the mimic flail. Where dost thou deck the much disordered hall, While the tired damsel in Elysium sleeps? With early voice to drowsy workmen call, Or lull the dame while mirth his vigils keeps? 'Twas thus in Caledonia's domes, 'tis said, Thou ply'dst the kindly task in years of yore: At last, in luckless hour, some erring maid Spread in thy nightly cell of viands store; Ne'er was thy form beheld among their mountains more. Then wake (for well thou cans't) that wond'rous lay, How, while around the thoughtless matrons sleep, Soft o'er the floor the treacherous fairies creep, And bear the smiling infant far away: How starts the nurse, when, for her lovely child, She sees at dawn a gaping idiot stare! O snatch the innocent from demons wilde, And save the parents fond from fell despair! In a deep cave the trusty menials wait, When from their hilly dens, at midnight's hour, Forth rush the airy elves in mimic state, And o'er the moonlight heath with swiftness scour! In glittering arms the little horsemen shine: Last, on a milk-white steed, with targe of gold, A fay of might appears, whose arms entwine The lost lamented child! the shepherds bold The unconscious infant tear from his unhallowed hold. MINSTRELSY OF THE SCOTTISH BORDER. PART FIRST. HISTORICAL BALLADS. THE SANG OF THE OUTLAW MURRAY. Etricke foreste is a feir foreste, In it grows manie a semelie trie; There's hart and hynd, and dae and rae, And of a' wilde beastes grete plentie. There's a feir castelle, bigged wi' lyme and stane, O! gin it stands not pleasauntlie! In the forefront o' that castelle feir, Twa unicorns are bra' to see; There's the picture of a knight, and a ladye bright, And the grene hollin abune their brie. There an Outlaw keepis five hundred men, He keepis a royalle cumpanie; His merryemen are a' in ae liverye clad, O' the Linkome grene sae gae to see; He and his ladye in purple clad: O! gin they lived not royallie.— Word is gane to our nobil king, In Edinburgh, where that he lay, That there was an Outlaw in Etricke foreste, Counted him nought, nor a' his courtrie gay. —“I make a vowe,” then the gude king said, “Unto the man that deir bought me, I'se either be king of Etricke foreste, Or king of Scotlonde that Outlaw sall be!”— Then spak the lord, hight Hamilton, And to the nobil king said he, —“My sovereign prince, sum counsell take, First at your nobilis, syne at me. “I redd ye, send yon bra' Outlaw till, And see gif your man come will he: Desyre him cum and be your man, And hald of you yon foreste frie. “Gif he refuses to do that, We'll conquess baith his landis and he; Or else, we'll throw his castelle down, And make a widowe o' his gaye ladye.”— The king then call'd a gentleman, James Boyd, (the Erle of Arran his brother was he) When James he cam befor the king, He knelit befor him on his kné. —“Wellcum, James Boyd!” said our nobil king; “A message ye maun gang for me; Ye maun hye to Etricke foreste, To yon Outlaw where bydeth he: “Ask him of whom he haldis his landis; Or man, wha may his master be; And desyre him cum, and be my man, And hald of me yon foreste frie. “To Edinburgh to cum and gang, His safe warrant I sall gie; And, gif he refuses to do that, We'll conquess baith his landis and he. “Thou may'st vow I'll cast his castelle down, And mak a widowe o' his gaye ladye; I'll hang his merryemen, payr by payr, In ony frith where I may them see.”— James Boyd tuik his leave o' the nobil king, To Etricke foreste feir cam he; Down Birkendale brae whan that he cam, He saw the feir foreste wi' his ee. Baith dae and rae, and hart and hinde, And of a' wilde beastis great plentie; He heard the bows that bauldly ring, And arrows whidderan' hym neir bi. Of that feir castelle he got a sight, The like he neir saw wi' his ee! On the forefront o' that castelle feir, Twa unicorns were gaye to see; The picture of a knight and a ladye bright, And the grene hollin abune their brie. Thereat he spyed five hundred men, Shuting with bows on Newark lee; They were a' in ae liverye clad, O' the Lincome grene sae gae to see. The knight and his ladye in purple clad, O gin they lived right royallie! Thereby Boyd kend he was master man, And serv'd him in his ain degré. —“God mot thee save, brave Outlaw Murray! Thy ladye, and all thy chyvalrye!”— —“Marry, thou's wellcum, gentelman; Sum king's messenger thou seimis to be.”— —“The king of Scotlond sent me here, And, gude Outlaw, I am sent to thee; I wad wot of whom ye hald your landis? Or man, wha may thy master be?”— —“Thir landis are mine;” the Outlaw said; “I ken nae king in Christentie; Frae Soudron I this foreste wan, When the king nor his knightis were not to see.”— —“He desyres you'll cum to Edinburgh, And hauld of him this foreste frie; And, gif ye refuse to do this, He'll conquess baith thy landis and thee. He hath vowed to cast thy castelle down, And make a widowe o' thy gaye ladye; “He'll hang thy merryemen payr by payr, In ony frith where he may them finde.”— —“Aye, by my troth!” the Outlaw said, “Then wald I think me far behind. “E'er the king my feir country get, This land that's nativest to me! Mony o' his nobilis sall be cauld, Their ladyes sall be right wearie.”— Then spak his ladye, feir of face; She seyd “Without consent o' me, That an Outlaw suld cum befor a king; I am right rad o' treasonrie. Bid him be gude to his lordis at hame, For Edinburgh my lord sall nevir see.”— James Boyd tuik his leave o' the Outlaw kene, To Edinburgh boun is he; When James he cam befor the king, He knelit lowlie on his kné. —“Wellcum, James Boyd!” seyd our nobil king; “What foreste is Etricke foreste frie?”— —“Etricke foreste is the feirest foreste, That evir man saw wi' his ee. “There's the dae, the rae, the harte, the hynde, And of a' wilde beastis grete plentie; There's a pretty castelle of lyme and stane, O gif it stands not pleasauntlie! “There's in the forefront o' that castelle, Twa unicorns, sae bra' to see; There's the picture of a knight and a ladye bright, Wi' the grene hollin abune their brie. “There the Outlaw keepis five hundred men, He keepis a royalle cumpanie; His merryemen in ae liverye clad, O' the Lincome grene sae gaye to see: He and his ladye in purple clad, O gin they live not royallie! “He says, yon foreste is his awin; He wan it frae the Southronie; Sae as he wan it, sae will he keep it, Contrair all kingis in Christentie.”— —“Gar warn me Perthshire, and Angus baith! Fife up and down, and the Louthians three; And graith my horse!” said the nobil king, “For to Etricke foreste hie will I me.”— Then word is gane the Outlaw till, In Etricke foreste where dwelleth he, That the king was cumand to his cuntrie, To conquess baith his landis and he. —“I mak a vow,” the Outlaw said, “I mak a vow, and that trulie, Were there but three men to tak my pairt, Yon king's cumand full deir suld be!”— Then messengers he called forth, And bade them hie them speedilye— —“Ane of ye gae to Halliday; The laird of the Corehead is he. “He certain is my sister's son; Bid him cum quick and succour me! The king cums on for Etricke foreste, And landless men we a' will be.”— —“What news? what news?” said Halliday, “Man, frae thy master unto me?”— —“Not as ye wad; seeking your aid; The king's his mortal enemie.”— —“Aye, by my troth!” said Halliday, “Even for that it repenteth me; For gif he lose feir Etricke foreste, He'll tak feir Moffatdale frae me. “I'll meet him wi' five hundred men, And surely mair, if mae may be; And befor he gets the foreste feir, We a' will die on Newark lee!”— The Outlaw call'd a messenger, And bid him hie him speedilye, To Andrew Murray of Cockpool— —“That man's a dear cousin to me; Desyre him cum, and mak me ayd, With a' the power that he may be.”— —“It stands me hard,” Andrew Murray said, “Judge gif it stands nae hard wi' me; To enter against a king wi' crown, And set my landis in jeopardie. Yet, if I cum not on the day, Surely at night he sall me see.”— To Sir James Murray of Traquair, A message cam right speedilye— —“What news? what news?” James Murray said, “Man, frae thy master unto me?”— —“What needs I tell? for weel ye ken, The king's his mortal enemie; And now he is cumand to Etricke foreste, And landless men ye a' will be.”— —“And, by my trothe,” James Murray said, “Wi' that Outlaw will I live and die; The king has gifted my landis lang syne, It canna be nae warse wi' me.”— The king was cumand thro' Caddon ford, And full five thousand men was he; They saw the derke foreste them befor, They thought it awsome for to see. Then spak the lord, hight Hamilton, And to the nobil king said he; —“My sovereign liege, sum council tak, First at your nobilis, syne at me. “Desyre him mete thee at Penmanscore, And bring four in his cumpanie; Five Erles sall gang yoursell befor, Gude cause that you suld honour'd be. “And, gif he refuses to do that, We'll conquess baith his landis and he; There sall nevir a Murray, after him, Hald land in Etricke foreste frie.”— Then spak the kene laird of Buckscleuth, A stalworthye man, and sterne was he— —“For a king to gang an Outlaw till, Is beneath his state and his dignitie! “The man that wons yon foreste intill, He lives by reif and felonie; Wherefore, brayd on, my sovereign liege! Wi' fire and sword we'll follow thee; Or, gif your courtrie lords fa' back, Our borderers sall the onset gie.”— Then out and spak the nobil king, And round him cast a wilie ee— —“Now haud thy tongue, Sir Walter Scott, Nor speik of reif nor felonie: For had everye honeste man his awin kye, A right puir clan thy name wad be!”— The king then call'd a gentelman, Royalle banner bearer there was he; James Hop Pringle of Torsonse, by name; He cam and knelit upon his kné. —“Wellcum, James Pringle of Torsonse! A message ye maun gang for me; Ye maun gae to yon Outlaw Murray, Surely where bauldly bideth he. “Bid him mete me at Penmanscore, And bring four in his cumpanie; Five Erles sall cum wi' mysell; Gude reasoun I suld honour'd be. “And, gif he refuses to do that, Bid him luke for nae gude o' me! There sall nevir a Murray, after him, Have land in Etricke foreste frie.”— James cam before the Outlaw kene, And serv'd him in his ain degré— —“Wellcum, James Pringle of Torsonse! What message frae the king to me?”— “He bids ye mete him at Penmanscore, And bring four in your cumpanie; Five Erles sall gang himsell befor; Nae mair in number will he be. “And, gif you refuse to do that, (I freely here upgive wi' thee) He'll cast yon bonny castelle down, And mak a widowe o' that gaye ladye. “He'll loose yon bluidhound borderers, Wi' fire and sword to follow thee; There will never a Murray, after thysell, Have land in Etricke foreste frie.”— —“It stands me hard,” the Outlaw said, “Judge gif it stands na hard wi' me! Wha reck not losing of mysell, But a' my offspring after me. “My merryemen's lives, my widowe's teirs— There lies the pang that pinches me! When I am straught in bluidie eard, Yon castelle will be right dreirie. “Auld Halliday, young Halliday, Ye sall be twa to gang wi' me; Andrew Murray, and Sir James Murray, We'll be nae mae in cumpanie.”— When that they cam befor the king, They fell before him on their kné. —“Graunt mercie, mercie, nobil king! E'en for his sake that died on trie.”— —“Sicken like mercie sall ye have; On gallows ye sall hangit be!”— —“Over God's forebode!” quoth the Outlaw then; “I hope your grace will bettir be! “Thir landis of Etricke foreste feir, I wan them from the enemie; Like as I wan them, sae will I keep them, Contrair a' kings in Christentie.”— All the nobilis the king about, Said pitie it were to see him die— —“Yet graunt me mercie, sovereign prince! Extend your favour unto me! “I'll give thee the keys of my castelle, Wi' the blessing o' my gaye ladye, Gin thoul't mak me sheriffe of this foreste, And a' my offspring after me.”— —“Wilt thou give me the keys of thy castelle, Wi' the blessing of thy gaye ladye? I'se mak thee sheriffe of Etricke foreste, Surely while upwards grows the trie: If you be not traitour to the king, Forfaulted sall thou nevir be.”— —“But, prince, what sall cum o' my men? When I gae back, traitour they'll ca' me; I had rather lose my life and land, E'er my merryemen rebuked me.”— —“Will your merryemen amend their lives? And a' their pardons I graunt thee— Now, name thy landis where'er they lie, And here I render them to thee.”— —“Fair Philiphaugh, prince, is my ain, But and a part of the Newark lee, “The Tinnies, and the Hangingshaw, My liege, are native steeds to me. I have mony steads in the foreste shaw, But them by name I dinna knaw.”— The keys o' the castelle he gave the king, Wi' the blessing o' his feir ladye; He was made sheriffe of Etricke foreste, Surely while upwards grows the trie; And if he was na traitour to the king, Forfaulted he suld nevir be. Wha ever heard, in ony times, Sicken an Outlaw in his degré, Sic favour get before a king, As did the Outlaw Murray of the foreste frie? BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE. It fell about the Lammas tide, When husbandmen do win their hay, Earl Douglas is to the English woods, And a' with him to fetch a prey. He has chosen the Lindsays light, With them the gallant Gordons gay; The Earl of Fife, withouten strife, And Sir Hugh the Montgomery, upon a gray. They have harried Northumberland, And sae have they Bambro'shire; The Otterdale they have burned it haill, And set it a' in a blaze o' fire. Out then spoke a bonny boy, That served ane o' Earl Douglas' kin— —“Methinks I see an English host, A coming branking us upon.”— —“If this be true, thou little foot page, If this be true thou tells to me, The brawest bower in Otterbourne, Shall be thy morning's fee. “But if it be false, thou little boy! But and a lie thou tells to me, On the highest tree in Otterbourne, Wi' my ain hands, I'll hang thee hie!”— The boy has ta'en out his little penknife, That hung right low down by his gare, And he gave Lord Douglas a deadly wound, I wot a deep wound and a sare. Earl Douglas to the Montgomery said, —“Take thou the vanguard of the three: And bury me by the braken bush, That grows upon yon lilye lee.”— The Percy and Montgomery met, That either of other were fain, They swapped swords, and they twa swat, And aye the blude ran down between. “Yield thee, O yield thee, Percy!” he said, Or else I vow I'll lay thee low!” “Whom to shall I yield,” said Earl Percy, Now that I see it must be so!” “Thou shalt not yield to lord nor loun, Nor yet shalt thou yield to me, But yield thee to the braken bush, That grows upon yon lilye lee!” “I will not yield to a braken bush, Nor yet will I to a brier, But I would yield to Earl Douglas, Or Sir Hugh the Montgomery, if he were here.” As soon as he knew it was Montgomery, He stuck his sword's point in the gronde; And the Montgomery was a courteous knight, And quickly took him by the honde. This deed was done at Otterbourne, About the breaking of the day; Earl Douglas was buried at the braken bush, And the Percy led captive away. JOHNIE ARMSTRANG. Sum speikis of Lords, sum speikis of Lairds, And sick lyke men of hie degrie; Of a gentleman I sing a sang, Sum time called Laird of Gilnockie. The King he wrytes a luving letter, With his ain hand sae tenderly, And he hath sent it to Johnie Armstrang, To cum and speik with him speidily. The Eliots and Armstrangs did convene, They were a gallant cumpanie— “We'll ride and meit our lawful King, And bring him safe to Gilnockie.” “Make kinnen and capon ready then, And venison in great plentie, We'll wellcome here our Royal King, I hope he'll dine at Gilnockie!” They ran their horse on the Langhome howm, And brak their speirs wi' mickle main; The Ladies lukit frae their loft windows— “God bring our men weel back agen!” When Johnie came before the King, Wi' a' his men sae brave to see, The King he movit his bonnet to him, He ween'd he was a King as well as he. “May I find grace, my Sovereign Leige, Grace for my loyal men and me? For my name it is Johnie Armstrang, And subject of your's, my Liege,” said he. “Away, away, thou traitor strang! Out of my sight soon may'st thou be! I grantit never a traitor's life, And now I'll not begin wi' thee.”— “Grant me my life, my Liege, my King! And a bonny gift I'll gie to thee— Full four and twenty milk-white steids, Were a' foaled in a year to me. “I'll gie thee a' these milk-white steids, That prance and nicker at a speir; And as mickle gude Inglish gilt, As four of their braid backs dow bear.”— “Away, away, thou traitor strang! Out of my sight soon may'st thou be! I grantit nevir a traitor's life, And now I'll not begin wi' thee!”— “Grant me my life, my Liege, my King! And a bonny gift I'll gie to thee— Gude four and twenty ganging mills, That gang thro' a' the year to me. “These four and twenty mills complete, Shall gang for thee thro' a' the yeir; And as meikle of gude reid wheit, As a' thair happers dow to bear.”— “Away, away, thou traitor strang! Out of my sight sune may'st thou be! I grantit nevir a traitor's life, And now I'll not begin wi' thee.”— “Grant me my life, my Liege, my King! And a great gift I'll gie to thee— Bauld four and twenty sister's sons, Shall for thee ficht, tho' all should flee!” “Away, away, thou traitor strang! Out of my sight sune may'st thou be! I grantit nevir a traitor's life, And now I'll not begin wi' thee.”— “Grant me my life, my Liege, my King! And a brave gift I'll gie to thee— All between heir and Newcastle town, Shall pay their yeirly rent to thee.”— “Away, away, thou traitor strang! Out of my sight sune may'st thou be! I grantit nevir a traitor's life, And now I'll not begin wi' thee.”— “Ye leid, ye leid, now King,” he says, Altho' a King and Prince ye be! For I've luved naething in my life, I weel dare say it, but honesty— “Save a fat horse, and a fair woman, Twa bonny dogs to kill a deir; But England suld have found me meal and mault, Gif I had lived this hundred yeir! “Sche suld have found me meil and mault, And beif and mutton in all plentie; But never a Scots wyfe could have said, That e'er I skaithed her a pure flee. “To seik het water beneith cauld ice, Surely it is a greit folie— I have asked grace at a graceless face, But there is nane for my men and me! “But, had I kenn'd ere I cam frae hame, How thou unkind wadst been to me! I wad have keepit the Border side, In spite of all thy force and thee. “Wist England's King that I was ta'en, O gin a blythe man he wad be! For anes I slew his sister's son, And on his breist bane brake a trie.”— John wore a girdle about his middle, Imbroidered ower wi' burning gold; Bespangled wi' the same metal, Maist beautiful was to behold. There hang nine targats at Johnie's hat, And ilk ane worth three hundred pound— “What wants that knave that a King suld have, But the sword of honour, and the crown? “O whair gat thou these targats, Johnie, That blink sae brawly abune thy brie?” “I gat them in the field fechting, Where, cruel King, thou durst not be. “Had I my horse, and harness gude, And riding as I wont to be, It suld have been tald this hundred yeir, The meeting of my King and me! “God be with thee, Kirsty, my brother, Lang live thou Laird of Mangertoun; Lang mayst thou live on the Border syde, Ere thou see thy brother ride up and down! “And God be with thee, Kirsty, my son! Where thou sits on thy nurse's knee; But and thou live this hundred yeir, Thy father's better thoul't never be. “Farewell! my bonny Gilnock-hall, Where on Eske side thou standest stout! Gif I had lived but seven years mair, I wad hae gilt thee round about.” John murdered was at Carlinrigg, And all his gallant cumpanie; But Scotland's heart was near sae wae, To see sae mony brave men die— Because they saved their country deir, Frae Englishmen! Nane were sae bauld, Whyle Johnie lived on the Border syde, Nane of them durst cum near his hauld. JOHNIE OF BREADISLEE. AN ANCIENT NITHISDALE BALLAD. Johnie rose up in a May morning, Called for water to wash his hands— “Gar loose to me the gude graie dogs, That are bound wi' iron bands.” When Johnie's mother gat word o' that, Her hands for dule she wrang— “O Johnie! for my bennison, To the grenewood dinna gang! “Eneugh ye hae o' the gude wheat bread, And eneugh o' the blude-red wine, And therefore for nae vennison, Johnie, I pray ye, stir frae hame.” But Johnie's buskt up his gude bend bow, His arrows, ane by ane, And he has gane to Durrisdeer, To hunt the dun deer down. As he came down by Merriemass, And in by the benty line, There has he espied a deer lying, Aneath a bush of ling. Johnie he shot, and the dun deer lap, And he wounded her on the side; But, atween the water and the brae, His hounds they laid her pride. And Johnie has bryttled the deer sae weel, That he's had out her liver and lungs, And wi' these he has feasted his bludey hounds, As if they had been Erl's sons. They eat sae much o' the vennison, And drank sae much o' the blude, That Johnie and a' his bludey hounds Fell asleep as they had been dead. And by there cam a silly auld carle, An ill death mote he die! For he's awa to Hislinton, Where the Seven Foresters did lie. “What news, what news, ye gray headed carle? What news bring ye to me?”— —“I bring nae news,” said the gray headed carle, “Save what these eyes did see. “As I came down by Merriemass, And down amang the scroggs, The bonniest Childe that ever I saw, Lay sleeping amang his dogs. “The shirt that was upon his back, Was o' the holland fine; The doublet which was over that, Was o' the lincome twine. “The buttons that were on his sleeve, Were o' the gowd sae gude; The gude graie hounds he lay amang, Their mouths were dyed wi' blude.” Then out and spak the first forester, The heid man ower them a'— “If this be Johnie o' Breadislee, Nae nearer will we draw.” But up and spak the sixth forester, His sister's son was he; “If this be Johnie o' Breadislee, We soon shall gar him die!” The first flight of arrows the foresters shot, They wounded him on the knee; And out and spak the seventh forester, “The next will gar him die.” Johnie's set his back against an aik, His fute against a stane; And he has slain the seven foresters, He has slain them a' but ane. He has broke three ribs in that ane's side, But and his collar bane; He's laid him twa fald ower his steed, Bade him carry the tidings hame. “O is there na a bonnie bird, Can sing as I can say? Could flee away to my mother's bower, And tell to fetch Johnie away.” The starling flew to his mother's window stane, It whistled and it sang; And aye the ower word o' the tune Was—“Johnie tarries lang!” They made a rod o' the hazel bush, Another o' the slae thorn tree, And mony mony were the men At fetching our Johnie. Then out and spak his auld mother, And fast her teirs did fa'— “Ye wad nae be warn'd, my son Johnie, Frae the hunting to bide awa. “Aft hae I brought to Breadislee, The less gear and the mair, But I ne'er brought to Breadislee, What grieved my heart sae sair! “But wae betide that silly auld Carle, An ill death shall he die! For the highest tree on Merriemass, Shall be his morning's fee.” Now Johnie's gude bend bow is broke, And his gude graie dogs are slain; And his body lies dead in Durrisdeer, And his hunting it is done. THE LOCHMABEN HARPER. O heard ye na o' the silly blind harper, How lang he lived in Lochmaben town? And how he wad gang to fair England, To steal the Lord Warden's Wanton Brown? But first he gaed to his gude wyfe, Wi a' the haste that he could thole— “This wark,” quo' he, “will ne'er gae weel, Without a mare that has a foal.” Quo' she—“Thou hast a gude gray mare, That can baith lance o'er laigh and hie; Sae set thee on the gray mare's back, And leave the foal at hame wi' me.” So he is up to England gane, And even as fast as he may drie, And when he cam to Carlisle gate, O whae was there but the Warden, he? “Come into my hall, thou silly blind harper, And of thy harping let me hear”— “O by my sooth, “quo' the silly blind harper, I wad rather hae stabling for my mare!” The Warden look'd ower his left shoulder, And said unto his stable groom— “Gae take the silly blind harper's mare, And tie her beside my Wanton Brown.” Then aye he harped, and aye he carped, Till a' the Lordlings footed the floor; But an' the music was sae sweet, The groom had nae mind o' the stable door. And aye he harped, and aye he carped, Till a' the Nobles were fast asleep; Then quietly he took aff his shoon, And saftly down the stair did creep. Syne to the stable door he hied, Wi' tread as light as light could be, And when he opened and gaed in, There he fand thirty steeds and three. He took a cowt halter frae his hose, And o' his purpose he did na fail, He slipt it ower the Wanton's nose, And tied it to his gray mare's tail. He turned them loose at the castle gate, Ower muir and moss and ilka dale, And she ne'er let the Wanton bait, But kept him a-galloping hame to her foal. The mare she was right swift o' foot, She didna fail to find the way; For she was at Lochmaben gate, A lang three hours before the day. When she cam to the harper's door, There she gave mony a nicker and sneer— “Rise up,” quo' the wife, “thou lazy lass, Let in thy master and his mare.” Then up she rose, put on her cloathes, And keekit through at the lock-hole— “O! by my sooth,” then cried the lass, “Our mare has gotten a braw brown foal!” “Come, haud thy tongue, thou silly wench! The morn's but glancing in your ee”— —“I'll wad my hail fee against a groat, He's bigger than e'er our foal will be.” Now all this while, in merry Carlisle, The harper harped to hie and law; And the fiend thing dought they do but listen him to, Untill that the day began to daw. But on the morn, at fair day light, When they had ended a' their cheer, Behold the Wanton Brown was gane, And eke the poor blind harper's mare! “Allace! allace!” quo' the cunning auld harper, “And ever allace that I cam here! In Scotland I lost a braw cowt foal, In England they've stown my gude gray mare!” “Come! cease thy allacing, thou silly blind harper, And again of thy harping let us hear, And weel payd sall thy cowt foal be, And thou sall have a far better mare.” Then aye he harped, and aye he carped, Sae sweet were the harpings he let them hear! He was paid for the foal he had never lost, And three times ower for the gude Gray Mare. FAIR HELEN. PART FIRST. O! Sweetest sweet, and fairest fair, Of birth and worth beyond compare, Thou art the causer of my care, Since first I loved thee. Yet God hath given to me a mind, The which to thee shall prove as kind, As any one that thou shalt find, Of high or low degree. The shallowest water makes maist din, The deadest pool the deepest linn, The richest man least truth within, Tho' he preferred be. Yet nevertheless I am content, And never a whit my love repent, But think the time was a' weel spent, Tho' I disdained be. O! Helen sweet, and maist compleat, My captive spirit's at thy feet, Thinks thou still fit thus for to treat Thy captive cruelly. O! Helen brave, but this I crave, Of thy poor slave some pity have, And do him save that's near his grave, And dies for love of thee. PART SECOND. I wish I were where Helen lies, Night and day on me she cries, O that I were where Helen lies, On fair Kirconnell Lee! Curst be the heart that thought the thought, And curst the hand that fired the shot, When in my arms burd Helen dropt, And died to succour me. O think na ye my heart was sair, When my love dropt down and spak nae mair, There did she swoon wi' meikle care, On fair Kirconnell Lee. As I went down the water side, None but my foe to be my guide, None but my foe to be my guide, On fair Kirconnell Lee. I lighted down, my sword did draw, I hacked him in pieces sma, I hacked him in pieces sma, For her sake that died for me. O Helen fair, beyond compare, I'll make a garland of thy hair, Shall bind my heart for evermair, Untill the day I die. O that I were where Helen lies, Night and day on me she cries, Out of my bed she bids me rise, Says, “haste, and come to me!” O Helen fair! O Helen chaste! If I were with thee I were blest, Where thou lies low, and takes thy rest On fair Kirconnell Lee. I wish my grave were growing green, A winding sheet drawn ower my e'en, And I in Helen's arms lying On fair Kirconnell Lee. I wish I were where Helen lies, Night and day on me she cries, And I am weary of the skies, For her sake that died for me. JAMIE TELFER OF THE FAIR DODHEAD. AN ANCIENT BORDER BALLAD. It fell about the Martinmas tyde, Whan our Border steeds get corn and hay, The Captain of Bewcastle hath bound him to ryde, And he's ower to Tividale to drive a prey. The first ae guide that they met wi', It was high up in Hardhaughswire, The second guide that they met wi', It was laigh down in Borthwick water. “What tidings, what tidings, my trusty guide?”— —“Nae tidings, nae tidings, I hae to thee; But gin ye'll gae to the fair Dodhead, Mony a cow's cauf I'll let thee see.” And whan they cam to the fair Dodhead, Right hastily they clam the peel, They loosed the kye out, ane and a', And ranshakled the house right weel. Now Jamie Telfer's heart was sair, The tear aye rowing in his e'e, He pled wi' the Captain to hae his gear, Or else revenged he wad be. The Captain turned him round, and leugh, Said—“Man, there's naething in thy house, But ae auld sword without a sheath, That hardly now wad fell a mouse!” The sun was na up, but the moon was down, It was the gryming of a new fa'n snaw, Jamie Telfer has run ten myles a-foot, Between the Dodhead and the Stobs's Ha'. And whan he cam to the fair tower yate, He shouted loud, and cried weel hie, Till out bespak auld Gibby Elliot— “Whae's this that brings the fray to me?”— “It's I, Jamie Telfer o' the fair Dodhead, And a harried man I think I be! There's naething left at the fair Dodhead, But a waefu' wife and bairnies three.”— “Gar seek your succour at Branksome Ha', For succour ye'se get nane frae me! Gae seek your succour where ye paid black mail, For man! ye ne'er paid money to me.” Jamie has turned him round about, I wat the tear blinded his e'e— “I'll ne'er pay mail to Elliot again, And the fair Dodhead I'll never see! “My hounds may a' rin masterless, My hawks may fly frae tree to tree, My Lord may grip my vassal lands, For there again maun I never be!” He has turned him to the Tiviot side, E'en as fast as he could drie, Till he cam to the Coultart Cleugh, And there he shouted baith loud and hie. Then up bespak him auld Jock Grieve— “Whae's this that brings the fray to me?”— —“It's I, Jamie Telfer o' the fair Dodhead, A harried man I trew I be! “There's naething left in the fair Dodhead, But a greeting wife and bairnies three, And sax poor ca's stand in the sta', A' routing loud for their minnie.”— “Alack a wae!” quo' auld Jock Grieve, Alack! my heart is sair for thee! For I was married on the elder sister, And you on the youngest of a' the three.” Then he has ta'en out a bonny black, Was right weel fed wi' corn and hay, And he's set Jamie Telfer on his back, To the Catslockhill to tak the fray. And whan he cam to the Catslockhill, He shouted loud, and cried weel hie, Till out and spak him William's Wat— “O whae's this brings the fray to me?”— “It's I, Jamie Telfer o' the fair Dodhead, A harried man I think I be! The Captain o' Bewcastle has driven my gear, For God's sake, rise, and succour me!”— “Alas for wae!” quo' William's Wat, “Alack, for thee my heart is sair! I never cam bye the fair Dodhead, That ever I fand thy basket bare.” He's set his twa sons on coal-black steeds, Himsel' upon a freckled gray, And they are on wi' Jamie Telfer, To Branksome Ha' to tak the fray. And whan they cam to Branksome Ha', They shouted a' baith loud and hie, Till up and spak him auld Buccleuch, Said—“Whae's this brings the fray to me?”— “It's I, Jamie Telfer o' the fair Dodhead, And a harried man I think I be! There's nought left in the fair Dodhead, But a greeting wife, and bairnies three.”— “Alack for wae!” quo' the gude auld Lord, And ever my heart is wae for thee! But fye gar cry on Willie, my son, And see that he cum to me speedilie! “Gar warn the water, braid and wide, Gar warn it sune and hastilie! They that winna ride for Telfer's kye, Let them never look in the face o' me! “Warn Wat o' Harden, and his sons, Wi' them will Borthwick water ride; Warn Gaudilands, and Allanhaugh, And Gilmanscleugh, and Commonside. “Ride by the gate at Priesthaughswire, And warn the Currors o' the Lee; As ye cum down the Hermitage Slack, Warn doughty Willie o' Gorrinberry.”— The Scots they rade, the Scots they ran, Sae starkly and sae steadilie! And aye the ower-word o' the thrang Was—“Rise for Branksome readilie!” The gear was driven the Frostylee up, Frae the Frostylee unto the plain, Whan Willie has looked his men before, And saw the kye right fast driving. “Whae drives thir kye?” can Willie say, “To mak an outspeckle o' me?”— —“It's I, the Captain o' Bewcastle, Willie, I winna layne my name for thee.”— “O will ye let Telfer's kye gae back? Or will ye do aught for regard o' me? Or, by the faith of my body,” quo' Willie Scott, I'se ware my dame's cauf's skin on thee!”— “I winna let the kye gae back, Neither for thy love, nor yet thy fear, But I will drive Jamie Telfer's kye, In spite of every Scot that's here.”— “Set on them, lads!” quo' Willie than, “Fye, lads, set on them cruellie! For ere they win to the Ritterford, Mony a toom saddle there sall be!” Then till't they gaed wi' heart and hand, The blows fell thick as bickering hail, And mony a horse ran masterless, And mony a comely cheek was pale! But Willie was stricken ower the head, And through the knapscap the sword has gane, And Harden grat for very rage, Whan Willie on the grund lay slane. But he's taen aff his gude steel cap, And thrice he's waved it in the air— The Dinlay snaw was ne'er mair white Nor the lyart locks of Harden's hair. “Revenge! Revenge!” auld Wat can cry, “Fye, lads, lay on them cruellie! We'll ne'er see Tiviot side again, Or Willie's death revenged sall be.” O mony a horse ran masterless, The splintered lances flew on hie, But or they wan to the Kershope ford, The Scots had gotten the victory. John o' Brigham there was slane, And John o' Barlow, as I hear say; And thirty mae o' the Captain's men, Lay bleeding on the grund that day. The Captain was run through the thick of the thigh, And broken was his right leg bane, If he had lived this hundred years, He had never been loved by woman again. “Hae back thy kye!” the Captain said, “Dear kye, I trow, to some they be! For gin I suld live a hundred years, There will ne'er fair lady smile on me.” Then word is gane to the Captain's bride, Even in the bower where that she lay, That her Lord was prisoner in enemy's land, Since into Tividale he had led the way. “I wad lourd have had a winding sheet, And helped to put it ower his head, Ere he had been disgraced by the Border Scot, Whan he ower Liddel his men did lead!”— There was a wild gallant amang us a', His name was Watty wi' the Wudspurs, Cried—“On for his house in Stanegirthside, If ony man will ride with us!” Whan they cam to the Stanegirthside, They dang wi' trees, and burst the door, They loosed out a' the Captain's kye, And set them forth our lads before. There was an auld wife ayont the fire, A wee bit o' the Captain's kin— “Whae dare loose out the Captain's kye, Or answer to him and his men?”— “It's I, Watty Wudspurs, loose the kye! I winna layne my name frae thee! And I will loose out the Captain's kye, In scorn of a' his men and he.” Whan they cam to the fair Dodhead, They were a wellcum sight to see! For instead of his ain ten milk kye, Jamie Telfer has gotten thirty and three. And he has paid the rescue shot, Baith wi' gowd, and white monie, And at the burial o' Willie Scott, I wat was mony a weeping e'e. THE RAID OF THE REIDSWIRE. The seventh of July, the suith to say, At the Reidswire the tryst was set; Our Wardens they affixed the day, And as they promised, so they met. Alas! that day I'll ne'er forgett! Was sure sae feard and then sae faine— They came theare justice for to gett, Will never green to come again. Carmichael was our Warden then, He caused the country to conveen; And the Laird's Wat, that worthie man, Brought in that sirname weil beseen: The Armestranges, that aye hae been A hardie house, but not a hail, The Elliots' honnors to maintaine, Brought down the lave o' Liddesdale. Then Tividale came to wi' speid; The Sheriffe brought the Douglas down, Wi' Cranstane, Gladstain, good at need, Baith Rewle water, and Hawick town. Beanjeddart baldly made him boun, Wi' a' the Trumbills, stronge and stout; The Rutherfoords, with grit renown, Convoyed the town of Jedbrugh out. Of other clans I cannot tell, Because our warning was not wide. Be this our folks hae tane the fell, And planted down palliones their to bide. We looked down the other side, And saw come breasting ower the brae, Wi' Sir John Forster for their guyde, Full fiftene hundred men and mae. It grieved him sair that day, I trow, Wi' Sir George Hinrome of Schipsydehouse; Because we were not men enow, They counted us not worth a louse. Sir George was gentle, meek, and douse, But he was hail and hett as fire; And yet, for all his cracking crouse, He rewd the raid o' the Reidswire. To deal with proud men is but pain; For either must ye fight or flee, Or else no answer make again, But play the beast, and let them be. It was na wonder he was hie, Had Tindaill, Reedsdaill, at his hand, Wi' Cukdaill, Gladsdaill on the lee, And Hebsrime, and Northumberland. Yett was our meeting meek enough, Begun wi' merriment and mowes, And at the brae, aboon the heugh, The clark sate down to call the rowes. And some for kyne, and some for ewes, Called in of Dandrie, Hob, and Jock— We saw come marching ower the knows, Five hundred Fennicks in a flock. With jack and speir, and bowes all bent, And warlike weapons at their will: Although we were na weel content, Yet, be my trouth, we feard no ill. Some gaed to drink, and some stude still, And some to cairds and dice them sped, Till on ane Farnstein they fyled a bill, And he was fugitive and fled. Carmichaell bade them speik out plainlie, And cloke no cause for ill nor good; The other answering him as vainlie, Began to reckon kin and blood: He raise, and raxed him where he stood, And bade him match him with his marrows: Then Tindaill heard them reasun rude, And they loot off a flight of arrows. Then was there nought but bow and speir, And every man pulled out a brand; “A Schaftan and a Fenwick” thare: Gude Symington was slain frae hand. The Scotsmen cried on other to stand, Frae time they saw John Robson slain— What should they cry? the King's command Could cause no cowards turn again. Up rose the Laird to red the cumber, Which would not be for all his boast;— What could we doe with sic a number? Fyve thousand men into a host. Then Henry Purdie proved his cost, And very narrowlie had mischiefed him, And there we had our Warden lost, Wert not the grit God he reliev'd him. Another throw the breikes him bair, Whill flatlies to the grund he fell: Than thought I weel we had lost him there, Into my stomach it struck a knell! Yet up he raise, the treuth to tell ye, And laid about him dints full dour, His horsemen they raid sturdilie, And stude about him in the stoure. Then raise the slogan with ane shout— “Fy Tindaill, to it! Jedbrugh's here!” I trow he was not half sae stout, But anis his stomach was asteir. With gun and genzie, bow and speir, Men might see mony a cracked crown; But up amang the merchant geir, They were as busie as we were down. The swallow taill frae tackles flew, Five hundreth flain into the flight, But we had pestelets enow, And shot amang them as we might. With help of God the game gade right, Frae time the foremost of them fell; Then over the know, without goodnight, They ran with mony a shout and yell. But after they had turned backs, Yet Tindaill men they turned again; And had not been the merchant packs, There had been mae of Scotland slain. But Jesu! if the folks were fain To put the bussing on their thies; And so they fled, wi' a' their main, Down ower the brae like clogged bees. Sir Francis Russell ta'en was their, And hurt, as we hear men rehearse; Proud Wallinton was wounded sair, Albeit he be a Fennick fierce. But if ye wald a souldier search, Among them a' were ta'en that night, Was nane sae wordie to put in verse, As Colingwood, that courteous knight. Young Henry, scaiped home, is hurt; A souldier shot him with a bow: Scotland has cause to mak great sturt, For laiming of the Laird of Mow. The Laird's Wat did weel indeed, His freinds stood stoutlie by himsel', With little Gladstain, gude in need, For Gretein kend na gude be ill. The Sheriff wanted not gude will, Howbeit he might not fight so fast; Beanjeddart, Hundlie, and Hunthill, Three, on they laid weel at the last. Except the horsemen of the guard, If I could put men to availe, None stoutlier stood out for their laird, Nor did the lads of Liddesdail. But little harness had we there; But auld Badreule had on a jack, And did right weel, I you declare, With all his Trumbills at his back. Gude Ederstane was not to lack, Nor Kirktoun, Newtoun, noble men! Thir's all the specials I of speake, By others that I could not ken. Who did invent that day of play, We need not fear to find him soon; For Sir John Forster, I dare well say, Made us this noisome afternoon. Not that I speak preceislie out, That he supposed it would be perril; But pride, and breaking out of feuid, Garr'd Tindaill lads begin the quarrel. KINMONT WILLIE. O have ye na heard o' the fause Sakelde? O have ye na heard o' the keen Lord Scroop? How they hae ta'en bauld Kinmont Willie, On Hairibee to hang him up? Had Willie had but twenty men, But twenty men as stout as he, Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont ta'en, Wi' eight score in his companie. They band his legs beneath the steed, They tied his hands behind his back, They guarded him fivesome on each side, And they brought him ower the Liddel-rack. They led him thro' the Liddel-rack, And also thro' the Carlisle sands, They brought him to Carlisle castell, To be at my Lord Scroope's commands. —“My hands are tied, but my tongue is free! And whae will dare this deed avow? Or answer by the border law, Or answer to the bauld Buccleuch?”— —“Now haud thy tongue, thou rank reiver! There's never a Scot shall set ye free: Before ye cross my castle yate, I trow ye shall take farewell o' me.”— —“Fear na ye that, my Lord,” quo' Willie: “By the faith o' my bodie, Lord Scroop,” he said, “I never yet lodged in a hostelrie, But I paid my lawing before I gaed.”— Now word is gane to the bauld Keeper, In Branksome Ha' where that he lay, That Lord Scroope has ta'en the Kinmont Willie, Between the hours of night and day. He has ta'en the table wi' his hand, He garr'd the red wine spring on hie— —“Now Christ's curse on my head,” he said, “But avenged of Lord Scroop I'll be! “O is my basnet a widow's curch? Or my lance a wand of the willow tree? Or my arm a ladyes lilye hand, That an English Lord should lightly me! “And have they ta'en him, Kinmont Willie, Against the truce of border tide? And forgotten that the bauld Bacleuch Is Keeper here on the Scottish side? “And have they e'en ta'en him, Kinmont Willie, Withouten either dread or fear? And forgotten that the bauld Bacleuch Can back a steed, or shake a spear? “O were there war between the lands, As well I wot that there is none, I would slight Carlisle Castell high, Tho' it were builded of marble stone. “I would set that castell in a low, And sloken it with English blood! There's nevir a man in Cumberland, Should ken where Carlisle Castell stood. “But since nae war's between the lands, And there is peace, and peace should be; I'll neither harm English lad or lass, And yet the Kinmont freed shall be!”— He has call'd him forty Marchmen bauld, I trow they were of his ain name, Except Sir Gilbert Elliot call'd, The Laird of Stobs, I mean the same. He has call'd him forty Marchmen bauld, Were kinsmen to the bauld Buccleuch, With spur on heel and splent on spauld, And gleuves of green, and feathers blue. There were five and five, before them a', Wi' hunting horns and bugles bright; And five and five came wi' Buccleuch, Like Warden's men arrayed for fight; And five and five, like a mason gang, That carried the ladders lang and hie; And five and five, like broken men; And so they reached the Woodhouselee. And as we cross'd the bateable land, When to the English side we held, The first o' men that we met wi', Whae sould it be but fause Sakelde? —“Where be ye gaun, ye hunters keen?” Quo' fause Sakelde, “Come tell to me!”— —“We go to hunt an English stag Has trespassed on the Scots countrie.”— —“Where be ye gaun, ye marshal men?” Quo' fause Sakelde, “Come tell me true!”— —“We go to catch a rank reiver, Has broken faith wi' the bauld Buccleuch.”— —“Where are ye gaun, ye mason lads, Wi' a' your ladders lang and hie?”— —“We gang to herry a corbie's nest, That wons not far frae Woodhouselee.”— —“Where be ye gaun, ye broken men?” Quo' fause Sakelde, “Come tell to me!”— —Now Dickie of Dryhope led that band, And the never a word o' lear had he. —“Why trespass ye on the English side? Row-footed outlaws, stand!” quo' he,— The ne'er a word had Dickie to say, Sae he thrust the lance thro' his fause bodie. Then on we held for Carlisle toun, And at Staneshaw-bank the Eden we cross'd; The water was great and meikle of spait, But the nevir a horse nor man we lost. And when we reach'd the Staneshaw-bank, The wind was rising loud and hie; And there the Laird garr'd leave our steeds, For fear that they should stamp and nie. And when we left the Staneshaw-bank, The wind began full loud to blaw; But 'twas wind and weet, and fire and sleet, When we came beneath the castel wa'. We crept on knees and held our breath, Till we placed the ladders against the wa'; And sae ready was Buccleuch himsell To mount the first, before us a'. He has ta'en the watchman by the throat, He flung him down upon the lead— —“Had there not been peace between our lands, Upon the other side thou hadst gaed!” “Now sound out, trumpets!” quo' Buccleuch; “Lets waken Lord Scroope, right merrilie!”— Then loud the Warden's trumpets blew— “O whae dare meddle wi' me?”— Then speedilie to work we gaed, And raised the slogan ane and a', And cut a hole thro' a sheet of lead, And so we wan to the castel ha'. They thought King James and a' his men Had won the house wi' bow and speir; It was but twenty Scots and ten, That put a thousand in sic a stear! Wi' coulters, and wi' fore-hammers, We garr'd the bars bang merrilie, Untill we cam to the inner prison, Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie. And when we cam to the lower prison, Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie— —“O sleep ye, wake ye, Kinmont Willie, Upon the morn that thou's to die?”— —“O I sleep saft and I wake aft, It's lang since sleeping was fleyed frae me! Gie my service back to my wyfe and bairns, And a' gude fellows that speer for me.”— Then Red Rowan has hente him up, The starkest man in Teviotdale— —“Abide, abide now, Red Rowan, Till of my Lord Scroope I take farewell. “Farewell, farewell, my gude Lord Scroope! My gude Lord Scroope, farewell!” he cried— —“I'll pay you for my lodging maill, When first we meet on the border side.”— Then shoulder high, with shout and cry, We bore him down the ladder lang; At every stride Red Rowan made, I wot the Kinmont's airns play'd clang! —“O mony a time,” quo' Kinmont Willie, “I have ridden horse baith wild and wood, But a rougher beast than Red Rowan I ween my legs have ne'er bestrode. “And mony a time,” quo' Kinmont Willie, “I've pricked a horse out oure the furs, But since the day I backed a steed, I nevir wore sic cumbrous spurs!”— We scarce had won the Staneshaw-bank, When a' the Carlisle bells were rung, And a thousand men, in horse and foot, Cam wi' the keen Lord Scroope along. Buccleuch has turned to Eden water, Even where it flow'd frae bank to brim, And he has plunged in wi' a' his band, And safely swam them thro' the stream. He turned him on the other side, And at Lord Scroope his glove flung he— —“If ye like na my visit in merry England, In fair Scotland come visit me!”— All sore astonished stood Lord Scroope, He stood as still as rock of stane; He scarcely dared to trew his eyes, When thro' the water they had gane. —“He is either himsell a devil frae hell, Or else his mother a witch maun be; I wad na have ridden that wan water, For a' the gowd in Christentie.”— DICK O' THE COW. Now Liddesdale has layen lang in, There is nae riding there at a'; The horses are grown sae lither fat, They downa stur out o' the sta'. Fair Johnie Armstrang to Willie did say— “Billie, a riding we will gae; England and us have been lang at feid, Ablins we'll light on some bootie.”— Then they are come on to Hutton Ha'; They rade that proper place about; But the Laird he was the wiser man, For he had left nae gear without. For he had left nae gear to steal, Except sax sheep upon a lee: Quo' Johnie—“I'd rather in England die, Ere thir sax sheep gae to Liddesdale wi' me.”— —“But how ca' they the man we last met, Billie, as we cam ower the know?”— —“That same he is an innocent fule, And men they call him Dick o' the Cow.”— —“That fule has three as good ky of his ain, As there are in a' Cumberland, billie,” quo' he:— —“Betide me life, betide me death, These ky shall go to Liddesdale wi' me.”— Then they have come on to the poor fule's house, And they hae broken his wa's sae wide; They have loosed out Dick o' the Cow's three ky, And ta'en three co'erlets frae his wife's bed. Then on the morn when the day was light, The shouts and cries rase loud and hie: —“O had thy tongue, my wife,” he says, And o' thy crying let me be! “O had thy tongue, my wife,” he says, And o' thy crying let me be; And ay where thou hast lost ae cow, In gude suith I shall bring thee three.”— Now Dickie's gane to the gude Lord Scroop, And I wat a dreirie fule was he; —“Now had thy tongue, my fule,” he says, “For I may not stand to jest wi' thee.”— —“Shame fa' your jesting, my Lord!” quo' Dickie, “For nae sic jesting grees wi' me; Liddesdale's been in my house last night, And they hae awa my three ky frae me. “But I may nae langer in Cumberland dwell, To be your puir fule and your leal, Unless you gi' me leave, my Lord, To gae to Liddesdale and steal.”— —“I gi' thee leave! my fule,” he says— “Thou speakest against my honour and me; Unless thou gi' me thy trowth and thy hand, Thou'lt steal frae nane but whae sta' frae thee.”— —“There is my trowth and my right hand, My head shall hang on Hairibee; I'll ne'er cross Carlisle sands again, If I steal frae a man but whae sta' frae me.”— Dickie's ta'en leave o' lord and master, I wat a merry fule was he! He's bought a bridle and a pair of new spurs, And pack'd them up in his breek thie. Then Dickie's come on to Pudding-burn house, E'en as fast as he might drie; Then Dickie's come on to Pudding-burn, Where there were thirty Armstrangs and three. —“O what's this come o' me now?” quo' Dickie; “What mickle wae is this?” quo' he: “For here is but ae innocent fule, And there are thirty Armstrangs and three!”— Yet he has come up to the fair ha' board, Sae weil he's become his courtesie! —“Weil may ye be, my gude Laird's Jock! But the deil bless a' your cumpanie. “I'm come to plain o' your man, fair Johnie Armstrang, And syne o' his billie Willie,” quo' he; How they've been in my house last night, And they hae ta'en my three ky frae me.”— —“Ha!” quo' fair Johnie Armstrang, “we will him hang.”— —“Na,” quo' Willie, “we'll him slae.”— Than up and spak another young Armstrang, —“We'el gie him his batts and let him gae.”— But up and spak the gude Laird's Jock, The best falla in a' the cumpanie; —“Sit down thy ways a little while, Dickie, And a piece o' thy ain cow's hough I'll gie ye.”— But Dickie's heart it grew sae grit, That the ne'er a bit o't he dought to eat— Then was he aware of an auld peat house, Where a' the night he thought for to sleep. Then Dickie was ware of an auld peat house, Where a' the night he thought for to lye— And a' the prayers the pure fule prayed Were, “I wish I had amends for my gude three ky!”— It was then the use of Pudding-burn house, And the house o' Mangerton, all haill, Them that cam na at the first ca', Gat nae mair meat till the neist meal. The lads that hungry and weary were, Abune the door-head they threw the key; Dickie he took gude notice o' that, Says—“There will be a bootie for me.”— Then Dickie has into the stable gane, Where there stood thirty horses and three; He has tied them a' wi' St Mary's knot, A' these horses but barely three. He has tied them a' wi' St Mary's knot, A' these horses but barely three; He's loupen on ane, ta'en another in hand, And away as fast as he can hie. But on the morn, when the day grew light, The shouts and cries raise loud and hie— —“Ah! whae has done this?” quo' the gude Laird's Jock, “Tell me the truth and the verity.”— “Whae has done this deed?” quo' the gude Laird's Jock; —“See that to me ye dinna lie!”— —“Dickie has been in the stable last night, And has ta'en my brother's horse and mine frae me.”— —“Ye wad ne'er be tald,” quo' the gude Laird's Jock; Have ye not found my tales fu' leil? Ye ne'er wad out o' England bide, Till crooked, and blind, and a' would steal.”— —“But lend me thy bay,” Fair Johnie can say, “There's nae horse loose in the stable save he; And I'll either fetch Dick o' the Cow again, Or the day is come that he shall die.”— —“To lend thee my bay!” the Laird's Jock can say, “He's baith worth gowd and gude monie; Dick o' the Cow has awa twa horse, I wish na thou may make him three.”— He has ta'en the Laird's jack on his back, A twa handed sword to hang by his thie; He has ta'en a steil cap on his head, And galloped on to follow Dickie. Dickie was na a mile frae aff the town, I wat a mile but barely three, When he was o'erta'en by Fair Johnie Armstrang, Hand for hand, on Cannobie lee. —“Abide, abide, thou traitour thief! The day is come that thou maun die.”— Then Dickie look't ower his left shoulder, Said—“Johnie, hast thou nae mae in companie?— “There is a preacher in our chapell, And a' the live lang day teaches he: When day is gane, and night is come, There's ne'er ae word I mark but three. “The first and second is—Faith and Conscience; The third—Ne'er let a traitor free: But, Johnie, what faith and conscience was thine When thou took awa my three ky frae me? “And when thou had ta'en awa my three ky, Thou thought in thy heart thou wast not weil sped, Till thou sent thy billie Willie ower the know, To take thrie coverlets off my wife's bed!”— Then Johnie let a speir fa' laigh by his thie, Thought weil to hae slain the innocent, I trow; But the powers above were mair than he, For he ran but the puir fule's jerkin through. Together they ran, or ever they blan; This was Dickie the fule and he— Dickie could na win at him wi' the blade o' the sword, But feld him wi' the plummet under the e'e. Thus Dickie has feld Fair Johnie Armstrang, The prettiest man in the south country— —“Gramercy!” then can Dickie say, “I had but twa horse, thou hast made me thrie!”— He's tane the steil jack aff Johnie's back, The twa handed sword that hang low by his thie; He's ta'en the steil cap aff his head— —“Johnie, I'll tell my master I met wi' thee.”— When Johnie wakened out o' his dream, I wat a dreirie man was he: —“And is thou gane? Now, Dickie, than The shame and dule is left wi' me. “And is thou gane? Now, Dickie, than The deil gae in thy companie! For if I should live these hundred years, I ne'er shall fight wi' a fule after thee.”— Then Dickie's come hame to the gude Lord Scroope, E'en as fast as he might hie— —“Now, Dickie, I'll neither eat nor drink, Till hie hanged thou shalt be.”— —“The shame speed the liars, my Lord!” quo' Dickie; “This was na the promise ye made to me! For I'd ne'er gane to Liddesdale to steal, Had I not got my leave frae thee.”— —“But what garr'd thee steal the Laird's Jock's horse? And, limmer, what garr'd ye steal him?” quo' he; “For lang thou mightst in Cumberland dwelt, Ere the Laird's Jock had stown frae thee.”— —“Indeed I wat ye lied, my Lord! And e'en sae loud as I hear ye lie! I wan the horse frae Fair Johnie Armstrang, Hand to hand on Cannobie Lee.” “There is the jack was on his back, This twa handed sword hang laigh by his thie, And there's the steil cap was on his head; I brought a' these tokens to let thee see.”— —“If that be true thou to me tells, (And I think thou dares na tell a lie,) I'll gie thee fifteen punds for the horse, Weil tald on thy cloak lap shall be. “I'll gie thee ane o' my best milk ky, To maintain thy wife and children thrie; And that may be as gude, I think, As ony twa o' thine wad be.”— —“The shame speed the liars, my Lord!” quo' Dickie; “Trow ye ay to make a fule o' me? I'll either hae twenty punds for the gude horse, Or he's gae to Mortan fair wi' me.”— He's gien him twenty punds for the gude horse, A' in goud and gude monie; He's gien him ane o' his best milk ky, To maintain his wife and children thrie. Then Dickie's come down thro' Carlisle toun, E'en as fast as he could drie; The first o' men that he met wi' Was my Lord's brother, Bailiff Glozenburrie. —“Weil be ye met, my gude Ralph Scroope!”— —“Welcome, my brother's fule!” quo' he; “Where didst thou get Fair Johnie Armstrang's horse?”— —“Where did I get him? but steal him,” quo' he.— —“But wilt thou sell me the bonny horse? And, billie, wilt thou sell him to me?” quo' he:— —“Aye; if thoul't tell me the monie on my cloak lap: For there's never ae penny I'll trust thee.”— —“I'll gie thee ten punds for the gude horse, Weil tald on thy cloak lap they shall be; And I'll gie thee ane o' the best milk ky, To maintain thy wife and children three.”— “The shame speid the liars, my Lord!” quo' Dickie; “Trow ye ay to make a fule o' me? I'll either hae twenty punds for the gude horse, Or he's gae to Mortan fair wi' me.”— He's gien him twenty punds for the gude horse, Baith in goud and gude monie; He's gien him ane o' his best milk ky, To maintain his wife and children thrie. Then Dickie lap a loup fu' hie, And I wat a loud laugh laughed he— —“I wish the neck o' the third horse were broken, If ony of the twa were better than he.”— Then Dickie's come hame to his wife again, Judge ye how the poor fule had sped: He has gien her twa score English punds, For the thrie auld coverlets taen aff her bed. —“And tak thee these twa as gude ky, I trow as a' thy thrie might be; And yet here is a white footed nagie, I trow he'll carry baith thee and me. “But I may nae langer in Cumberland bide, The Armstrangs they would hang me hie.”— So Dickie's ta'en leave at lord and master, And at Burgh under Stanmuir there dwells he. JOCK O' THE SIDE. Now Liddesdale has ridden a raid, But I wat they had better hae staid at hame; For Michael o' Winfield he is dead, And Jock o' the Side is prisoner ta'en. For Mangerton house Lady Downie has gane, Her coats she has kilted up to her knee; And down the water wi' speed she rins, While tears in spaits fa' fast frae her e'e. Then up and spoke our gude auld Lord— —“What news? what news, sister Downie, to me?”— —“Bad news, bad news, my Lord Mangerton; Michael is killed, and they hae ta'en my son Johnie.”— —“Ne'er feir, sister Downie,” quo' Mangerton; —“I have yokes of ousen, eighty and three; My barns, my byres, and my faulds a' weil fill'd, And I'll part wi' them a' ere Johnie shall die. “Three men I'll send to set him free, A' harneist wi' the best o' steil; The English louns may hear, and drie The weight o' their braid swords to feel. “The Laird's Jock ane, the Laird's Wat twa, O Hobbie Noble, thou ane maun be! Thy coat is blue, thou hast been true, Since England banish'd thee to me.”— Now Hobbie was an English man, In Bewcastle dale was bred and born: But his misdeeds they were so great, They banished him ne'er to return. Lord Mangerton them orders gave, —“Your horses the wrang way maun be shod; Like gentlemen ye mauna seim, But look like corn caugers ga'en the road. “Your armour gude ye mauna shaw, Nor yet appear like men o' weir; As country lads be a' array'd, Wi' branks and brecham on each mare.”— Sae now their horses are the wrang way shod, And Hobbie has mounted his grey sae fine; Jock his lively bay, Wat's on his white horse, behind, And on they rode for the water of Tyne. At the Cholerford they all light down, And there, wi' the help of the light o' the moon, A tree they cut, wi' fifteen nogs on each side, To climb up the wa' of Newcastle toun. But when they cam to Newcastle toun, And were alighted at the wa', They fand their trie three ells ower laigh, They fand their stick baith short and sma'. Then up and spak the Laird's ain Jock, —“There's naething for't; the gates we maun force.”— But when they cam the gate untill, A proud porter withstood baith men and horse. His neck in twa the Armstrang's wrang, Wi' fute or hand he ne'er play'd pa! His life and his keys at anes they hae ta'en, And cast the body ahind the wa'. Now sune they reach Newcastle jail, And to the prisoner thus they call— —“Sleeps thou, wakes thou, Jock o' the Side, Or art thou weary of thy thrall?”— Jock answers thus, wi' dulefu' tone, —“Aft, aft, I wake—I seldom sleep: But whae's this kens my name sae weil, And thus to mese my waes does seik?”— Then out and spak the gude Laird's Jock, —“Now fear ye na, my billie,” quo' he; “For here are the Laird's Jock, the Laird's Wat, And Hobbie Noble come to set thee free.”— —“Now had thy tongue, my gude Laird's Jock, For ever alas! this canna be; For if a' Liddesdale was here the night, The morn's the day that I maun die. “Full fifteen stane o' Spanish iron, They hae laid a' right sair on me; Wi' locks and keys I am fast bound Into this dungeon dark and dreirie.”— —“Fear ye na' that,” quo' the Laird's Jock; “A faint heart ne'er wan a fair ladie; Work thou within, we'll work without, And I'll be sworn we'll set thee free.”— The first strong door that they cam at, They loosed it without a key; The next chain'd door that they cam at, They garr'd it a' to flinders flee. The prisoner now upon his back, The Laird's Jock has gotten up fu' hie; And down the stair, him, irons and a', Wi' nae sma' speid and joy, brings he. —“Now Jock, my man,” quo' Hobbie Noble, “Some o' his weight ye may lay on me.”— —“I wat weil no!” quo the Laird's ain Jock, “I count him lighter than a flee.”— Sae out at the gates they a' are gane, The prisoner's set on horseback hie; And now wi' speid they've ta'en the gate, While ilk ane jokes fu' wantonlie: —“O Jock! sae winsomely's ye ride, Wi' baith your feet upon ae side; Sae well ye're harneist, and sae trigg, In troth ye sit like ony bride!”— The night, tho' wat, they did na mind, But hied them on fu' merrilie, Until they cam to Cholerford brae, Where the water ran like mountains hie. But when they cam to Cholerford, There they met with an auld man; Says—“Honest man, will the water ride? Tell us in haste, if that ye can.”— —“I wat weel no,” quo' the gude auld man; “I hae lived here threty years and thrie, And I ne'er yet saw the Tyne sae big, Nor running anes sae like a sea.”— Then out and spak the Laird's saft Wat, The greatest coward in the companie— —“Now halt, now halt, we need na try't; The day is come we a' maun die!”— —“Puir faint hearted thief!” cried the Laird's ain Jock, “There'l nae man die but him that's fie; I'll guide ye a' right safely thro'; Lift ye the pris'ner on ahint me.”— Wi' that the water they hae ta'en, By anes and twa's they a' swam thro'; —“Here are we a' safe,” quo the Laird's Jock, “And puir faint Wat, what think ye now?”— They scarce the other brae had won, When twenty men they saw pursue; Frae Newcastle toun they had been sent, A' English lads baith stout and true. But when the Land-serjeant the water saw, —“It winna ride, my lads,” says he; Then cried aloud—“The prisoner take, But leave the fetters, I pray, to me.”— —“I wat weil no,” quo' the Laird's Jock; “I'll keep them a'; shoon to my mare they'll be: My gude bay mare—for I am sure She has bought them a' right dear frae thee.”— Sae now they are on to Liddesdale, E'en as fast as they could them hie; The prisoner is brought to's ain fire-side, And there o's airns they mak him free. —“Now Jock, my billie,” quo' a' the three, “The day is com'd thou was to die; But thou's as weil at thy ain ingle side Now sitting, I think, 'twixt thee and me.”— HOBBIE NOBLE. Foul fa' the breast first treason bred in! That Liddesdale may safely say: For in it there was baith meat and drink, And corn unto our geldings gay. And we were a' stout hearted men, As England she might often say; But now, we may turn our backs and flee, Since brave Noble is sold away. Now Hobbie was an Englishman, And born into Bewcastle dale; But his misdeeds they were sae great, They banished him to Liddesdale. At Kershope foot the tryst was set, Kershope of the lily lee; And there was traitor Sim o' the Mains, And with him a private companie. Then Hobbie has graithed his body fair, Baith wi' the iron and wi' the steil, And he has ta'en out his fringed grey, And there brave Hobbie he rade him weel. Then Hobbie is down the water gane, E'en as fast as he could hie; Tho' a' should hae bursten and broken their hearts, Frae that riding tryst he wad na be. —“Weel be ye met, my feres five! And now, what is your will wi' me?”— Then they cried a' wi' ae consent, —“Thou'rt welcome here, brave Noble, to me.— —“Wilt thou with us into England ride, And thy safe warrand we will be? If we get a horse worth a hundred pound, Upon his back thou sune shalt be.”— —“I dare not by day into England ride; The Land Serjeant has me at feid: And I know not what evil may betide, For Peter of Whitfield his brother is dead. “And Anton Shiel he loves not me, For I gat twa drifts o' his sheep; The great Earl of Whitfield loves me not, For nae geer frae me he e'er could keep. “But will ye stay till the day gae down— Until the night come o'er the grund? And I'll be a guide worth ony twa, That may in Liddesdale be found. “Tho' the night be black as pick and tar, I'll guide ye o'er yon hills sae hie; And bring ye a' in safety back, If ye'll be true and follow me.”— He has guided them o'er moss and muir, O'er hill and hope and mony a down; Until they cam to the Foulbogshiel, And there, brave Noble, he lighted down. But word is gane to the Land Serjeant, In Askerton where that he lay— —“The deer that ye hae hunted sae lang, Is seen into the waste this day.”— —“Then Hobbie Noble is that deer! I wat he carries the style fu' hie; Aft has he driven our bluidhounds back, And set ourselves at little lee. “Gar warn the bows of Hartlie-burn; See they sharp their arrows on the wa': Warn Willeva, and Speir Edom, And see the morn they meet me a'. “Gar meet me on the Rodric-haugh, And see it be by break o' day; And we will on to Conscouthart-green, For there, I think, we'll get our prey.” Then Hobbie Noble has dreimt a dreim, In the Foulbogshiel where that he lay; He dreimt his horse was aneath him shot, And he himself got hard away. The cocks could craw, the day could daw, And I wot so even fell down the rain; Had Hobbie na waken'd at that time, In the Foulbogshiel he had been ta'en or slain. —“Awake, awake, my feres five! I trow here makes a fu' ill day; Yet the worst cloak o' this company, I hope, shall cross the waste this day.”— Now Hobbie thought the gates were clear; But ever alas! it was na sae: They were beset by cruel men and keen, That away brave Hobbie might na gae. —“Yet follow me, my feres five, And see ye keip of me guid ray; And the worst cloak of this company Even yet may cross the waste this day.”— But the Land Serjeant's men came Hobbie befor, The traitor Sim came Hobbie behin', So had Noble been wight as Wallace was, Away, alas! he might na win. Then Hobbie had but a laddie's sword; But he did mair than a laddie's deed: For that sword had clear'd Conscouthart green, Had it not broke o'er Jerswigham's head. Then they hae ta'en brave Hobbie Noble, Wi's ain bowstring they band him sae; But his gentle heart was ne'er sae sair As when his ain five bound him on the brae. They hae ta'en him on for West Carlisle; They asked him if he kend the way? Tho' much he thought, yet little he said— He knew the gate as weel as they. They hae ta'en him up the Ricker-gate; The wives they cast their windows wide: And every wife to another can say, —“That's the man loosed Jock o' the Side!”— —“Fy on ye, women! why ca' ye me man? For its nae man that I'm used like; I am but like a forfoughen hound, Has been fighting in a dirty syke.”— They hae had him up thro' Carlisle toun, And set him by the chimney fire; They gave brave Noble a loaf to eat, And that was little his desire. They gave him a wheat loaf to eat, And after that a can of beer; And they a' cried, with one consent, —“Eat, brave Noble, and make gude cheir. “Confess my Lord's horse, Hobbie,” they said, “And to-morrow in Carlisle thou's na die.”— —“How can I confess them,” Hobbie says, “When I never saw them with my e'e?”— Then Hobbie has sworn a fu' great aith, Bi the day that he was gotten and born, He never had ony thing o' my Lord's, That either eat him grass or corn. —“Now fare thee weel, sweet Mangerton! For I think again I'll ne'er thee see: I wad hae betrayed nae lad alive, For a' the goud o' Christentie. “And fare thee weel, sweet Liddesdale! Baith the hie land and the law; Keep ye weel frae the traitor Mains! For goud and geir he'll sell ye a'. “Yet wad I rather be ca'd Hobbie Noble, In Carlisle where he suffers for his fau't— Than I'd be ca'd the traitor Mains, That eats and drinks o' the meal and maut.”— ARCHIE OF CA'FIELD. As I was walking mine alane, It was by the dawning of the day; I heard twa brithers make their mane, And I listened weel to what they did say The eldest to the youngest said, —“O dear brither, how maun this be? There were three brithren of us born, And ane of us is condemned to die.”— —“O chuse ye out a hundred men, A hundred men baith leal and free; And we'll awa' to Dumfries toun, And set our billy Archie free.—” —“A hundred men you cannot get, A hundred men baith leal and free: For some of them wad turn a-back, And other some but work for fee. “But chuse ye out eleven men, And we ourselves thirteen will be; And we'll awa to Dumfries toun, And borrow bonnie billy Archie.”— There was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching on the lee; Until they cam to Murraywhate And they lighted there right speedilie. —“A smith! a smith!” Dickie he cries, “A smith! a smith! right speedilie; To turn back the caukers of our horses' shoon; For its unkensome we wad be.”— There was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching upon the lee; Until they cam to Dumfries port, And they lighted there right speedilie. —“There's six of us will hold the horse, And other six will watchmen be: But wha's the man, amang ye a', Will gae to the Tolbooth door wi' me?”— O up then spak him Jockie Hall, (Frae the laigh Tiviotdale was he;) —“If it should cost my life this very night, I'll gae to the Tolbooth door wi' thee.”— —“Be of gude cheir! now, Archie, lad; Be of gude cheir! now, dear billie; Work thou within, and we without, And the morn thou'se dine at Ca'field wi' me. O Jockie Hall stepped to the door; And he bended low back his knee; And he made the bolts the door hang on, Loup frae the wa' right wantonlie. He took the prisoner on his back, And down the Tolbooth stair cam he; The gray colt stood ready at the door, I wot a foot ne'er sturred he. They laid the links out owre his neck, And that was his gold twist to be; And they cam down thro' Dumfries toun And wow but they cam speedily. There was horsing, horsing in haste, And there was marching upon the lee; Until they cam to the Murraywhate, And they lighted there right speedily. —“A smith! a smith!” then Dickie he cries; “A smith! a smith! right speedily; To file the irons frae my dear brither, For forward, forward we wad be.”— They had na filed a shackle of iron, A shackle of iron but barely thrie, When out and spak young Simon brave— —“O dinna ye see what I do see?” “Lo! yonder comes Lieutenant Gordon, Wi' a hundred men in his companie.”— —“O woes is me!” quo' Archie then, “For I am the prisoner, and I maun die!”— O there was mounting, mounting in haste, And there was marching upon the lee; Until they cam to Annan water, And it was flowing like the sea. —“The gude grey colt is but four year old, And he can amble like the wind; But when he comes to the belly deep, He lays himself down upon the ground. “But I have a mare, they ca' her Meg— And she's the best in Christentie; Set ye the prisoner me behind, There will nae man die but him that's fie.”— Now they did swim that wan water, And wow but they swam bonilie! Until they cam to the other side, And they wrang their cloathes right drunkily. —“Come thro', come thro', Lieutenant Gordon; Come thro' and drink some wine wi' me; For there is an ale-house here hard by, And it shall not cost thee ae penny.”— —“Throw me my irons,” quo' Lieutenant Gordon; “I wot they cost me dear aneugh.”— —“The shame a ma,” quo' Jockie Ha'; “They'll be gude shackles to my pleugh.”— —“Come thro', come thro', Lieutenant Gordon; Come thro' and drink some wine wi' me; Yestreen was I your prisoner, But now this morning am I free.” ARMSTRONG'S GOODNIGHT. This night is my departing night, For here nae langer must I stay; There's neither friend nor foe o' mine But wishes me away. What I have done thro' lack of wit, I never, never, can recall; I hope ye're a' my friends as yet, Goodnight, and joy be with you all! THE FRAY OF SUPORT. Sleep'ry Sim of the Lamb-hill, And Snoring Jock of Suport-mill, Ye are baith right het and fou';— But my wae wakens na you. Last night I saw a sorry sight— Nought left me, o' four and twenty gude ousen and ky, My weel ridden gelding, and a white quey, But a toom byre and a wide, And the twelve nogs on ilka side. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. Weel may ye ken Last night I was right scarce o' men: But Toppet Hob o' the Mains had guesten'd in my house by chance; I set him to wear the fore-door wi' the speir, while I kept the back door wi' the lance; But they hae run him thro' the thick o' the thie, and broke his knee-pan, And the mergh o' his shin bane has run down on his spur leather whang— He's lame while he lives, and where e'er he may gang. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. But Peenye, my gude son, is out at the Hagbut-head, His e'en glittering for anger like a fierye gleed; Crying—“Mak sure the nooks “Of Maky's-muir-crooks; “For the wily Scot takes by nooks, hooks, and crooks. “Gin we meet a' together in a-head the morn, “We'll be merry men.”— Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. There's doughty Cuddy in the Heugh-head, Thou was aye gude at a' need: With thy brock-skin bag at thy belt, Ay ready to mak a puir man help. Thou maun awa' out to the Calf-craigs, (Where anes ye lost your ain twa naigs) And there toom thy brock-skin bag. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' ta'en. Doughty Dan o' the Houlet Hirst, Thou was aye gude at a birst: Gude wi' a bow, and better wi' a speir, The bauldest march-man that e'er followed gear; Come thou here. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. Rise, ye Carle Coopers, frae making o' kirns and tubs, In the Nicol forest woods. Your craft has na left the value of an oak rod— But if you had had ony fear o' God, Last night ye had na slept sae sound, And let my gear be a' ta'en. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. Ah! lads, we'll fang them a' in a net, For I hae a' the fords o' Liddel set— The Dunkin, and the Door-loup, The Willie-ford, and the Water-slack, The Black-rack, and the Trout-dub o' Liddel; There stands John Forster wi' five men at his back, Wi' bufft coat and cap of steil: Boo! ca' at them e'en, Jock; That ford's sicker I wat weil. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' ta'en. Hoo! hoo! gar raise the Reid Souter, and Ringan's Wat, Wi' a brod elshin and a wicker; I wat weil they'll mak a ford sicker. Sae whether they be Elliots or Armstrangs, Or rough riding Scots, or rude Johnstons, Or whether they be frae the Tarras or Ewsdale, They maun turn and fight, or try the deeps o' Liddel. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. —“Ah! but they will play ye another jigg, For they will out at the big rig, And thro' at Fargy Grame's gap.”— —“But I hae another wile for that: For I hae little Will, and stalwart Wat, And lang Aicky, in the Souter moor, Wi' his sleuth dog sits in his watch right sure; Shou'd the dog gie a bark, He'll be out in his sark, And die or won. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. Ha! boys—I see a party appearing—wha's yon? Methinks it's the Captain of Bewcastle, and Jephtha's John, Coming down by the foul steps of Catlowdie's loan— They'll mak a' sicker, come which way they will. Ha lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' ta'en. Captain Musgrave, and a' his band, Are coming down by the Siller-strand, And the muckle town-bell o' Carlisle is rung: My gear was a' weel won, And before it's carried o'er the border, mony a man's gae down. Fy lads! shout a' a' a' a' a' My gear's a' gane. LORD MAXWELL'S GOODNIGHT. “Adieu! Madame, my mother dear, But and my sisters three; Adieu! fair Robert of Orchardstane, My heart is wae for thee. Adieu! the lilye and the rose, The primrose fair to see; Adieu! my ladye, and only joy, For I may not stay with thee. “Though I hae slain the Lord Johnstone, What care I for their feid? My noble mind their wrath disdains:— He was my father's deid. Both night and day I laboured oft Of him avenged to be; But now I've got what lang I sought, And I may not stay with thee. “Adieu! Drumlanrig, false wert aye, And Closeburn in a band; The laird of Lag, frae my father that fled, When the Johnstone struck aff his hand. They were three brethren in a band— Joy may they never see! Their treacherous art, and cowardly heart, Has twin'd my love and me. “Adieu! Dumfries, my proper place, But and Carlaverock fair! Adieu! my castle of the Thrieve, Wi' a' my buildings there: Adieu! Lochmaben's gates sae fair, The Langholm-holm where birks there be; Adieu! my ladye, and only joy, For, trust me, I may not stay wi' thee. “Adieu! fair Eskdale up and down, Where my puir friends do dwell; The Bangisters will ding them down, And will them sair compell. But I'll avenge their feid mysell, When I come o'er the sea; Adieu! my ladye, and only joy, For I may not stay wi' thee.”— —“Lord of the land!”—that ladye said, “O wad ye go wi' me, Unto my brother's stately tower, Where safest ye may be! There Hamiltons and Douglas baith, Shall rise to succour thee.”— —“Thanks for thy kindness, fair my dame, But I may not stay wi' thee.”— Then he tuik aff a gay gold ring, Thereat hang signets three; —“Hae take thee that, mine ain dear thing, And still hae mind o' me; But, if thou take another Lord, Ere I come ower the sea— His life is but a three days lease, Tho' I may not stay wi' thee.”— The wind was fair, the ship was clear, That good Lord went away; And most part of his friends were there, To give him a fair convey. They drank the wine, they did na spair, Even in that gude Lord's sight— Sae now he's o'er the floods sae gray, And Lord Maxwell has ta'en his Goodnight. THE LADS OF WAMPHRAY. 'Twixt Girth-head and the Langwood end, Lived the Galliard, and the Galliard's men; But and the lads of Leverhay, That drove the Crichton's gear away. It is the lads of Lethenha', The greatest rogues amang them a': But and the lads of Stefenbiggin, They broke the house in at the riggin. The lads of Fingland, and Hellbeck-hill, They were never for good but aye for ill; 'Twixt the Staywood-bush and Langside-hill, They stealed the broked cow and the branded bull. It is the lads of the Girth-head, The deil's in them for pride and greed; For the Galliard, and the gay Galliard's men, They ne'er saw a horse but they made it their ain. The Galliard to Nithside is gane, To steal Sim Crichton's winsome dun; The Galliard is unto the stable gane, But instead of the dun, the blind he has ta'en. —“Now Simmy, Simmy of the Side, Come out and see a Johnstone ride! Here's the bonniest horse in a' Nithside, And a gentle Johnstone aboon his hide.”— Simmy Crichton's mounted then, And Crichtons has raised mony a ane; The Galliard trowed his horse had been wight, But the Crichtons beat him out o' sight. As soon as the Galliard the Crichton saw, Behind the saugh-bush he did draw; And there the Crichtons the Galliard hae ta'en, And nane wi' him but Willie alane. —“O Simmy, Simmy, now let me gang, And I'll never mair do a Crichton wrang! O Simmy, Simmy, now let me be, And a peck o' gowd I'll give to thee! “O Simmy, Simmy, now let me gang, And my wife shall heap it with her hand.”— But the Crichton wad na let the Galliard be, But they hanged him hie upon a tree. O think then Willie he was right wae, When he saw his uncle guided sae; —“But if ever I live Wamphray to see, My uncle's death avenged shall be.”— Back to Wamphray he is gane, And riders has raised mony a ane; Saying—“My lads, if ye'll be true, Ye shall a' be clad in the noble blue.”— Back to Nithisdale they have gane, And awa' the Crichton's nowt hae ta'en; But when they cam to the Wellpath-head, The Crichtons bade them 'light and lead. And when they cam to the Biddess burn, The Crichtons bade them stand and turn; And when they cam to the Biddess strand, The Crichtons they were hard at hand. But when they cam to the Biddess law, The Johnstones bade them stand and draw; —“We've done nae ill, we'll thole nae wrang, But back to Wamphray we will gang.”— And out spoke Willy o' the Kirkhill, —“Of fighting, lads, ye'se hae your fill.”— And from his horse Willie he lap, And a burnished brand in his hand he gat. Out through the Crichtons Willie he ran, And dang them down baith horse and man; O but the Johnstones were wondrous rude, When the Biddess burn ran three days blood! —“Now, Sirs, we hae done a noble deed; We have revenged the Galliard's bleid: For every finger of the Galliard's hand, I vow this day I've killed a man.”— As they cam in at Evan-head, At Ricklaw-holm they spread abread; —“Drive on, my lads! it will be late; We'll hae a pint at Wamphray gate.”— For where'er I gang, or e'er I ride, The Lads of Wamphray are on my side; And of a' the lads that I do ken, A Wamphray lad's the king of men. THE LAIRD OF LAMINTON. There came the laird of Laminton Out frae the north countrie, To court a gallant gay ladye; And in presents entered he. He neither spared for gowd nor gear, For she was a weel fared may; And when he gat her friends' consent, He set the wedding day. She sent to the laird of Lauderdale, Gin he wad come to see; And he has sent word back again, Weel answered she suld be. And he has sent a messenger, Right quickly through the land; And raised mony an armed man, To be at his command. The bride looked out at a high window, Beheld baith dale and down; And she was aware of her first true love, With riders mony a one. She scoffed him, and scorned him, Upon her wedding day; And said—“It was the fairy court To see him in array! —“O come ye here to fight, young Lord, Or come ye here to play? Or come ye here to drink good wine, Upon the wedding day?”— —“I come na here to fight,” he said, “I come na here to play; I'll but lead a dance wi' the bonny bride, And mount and go my way.”— It is a glass of the blood-red wine, Was filled up them between; And aye she drank to Lauderdale, Wha her true love had been. He's ta'en her by the milk white hand, And by the grass green sleeve; He's mounted her hie behind himsell, At her kinsmen spear'd na leave. Then whingers flew frae gentles' sides, And swords flew frae the shea's, And red and rosy was the blood Ran down the lily braes. The blood ran down by Cowden bank, And down by Cowden brae; And, sighing, said the bonny bride— —“O waes me for foul play!”— My blessing on your heart, sweet thing: Wae to your willfu' will: There's mony a gallant gentleman Whae's blude ye have garr'd to spill. Now a' you that be norland men, And that be norland born, Come never south to seek a wife, For they will gie you the scorn. They'll haik ye up, and settle ye bye, Till on your wedding day; Then gie ye frogs instead of fish, And play ye foul foul play. THE LAIRD OF OCHILTRIE. O listen, gude people, to my tale, Listen to what I tell to thee; The King has ta'en a puir prisoner, The wanton laird of Ochiltrie. When news cam to our guidly queen, She sicht, and said right mournfullie— —“O what will cum of lady Margaret, Wha bears sic luve to Ochiltrie!”— Lady Margaret tore her yallow hair, When as the queen tald hir the saim: —“I wis that I had ne'er been born, Nor never had known Ochiltrie's naim.”— —“Fie na,” quoth the queen, “that maunna be; Fie na, that maunna be: I'll find ye out a better way To save the lyfe of Ochiltrie.”— The queen she trippet up the stair, And lowly knelt upon her knee:— —“The first boon which I cum to crave Is the lyfe of gentle Ochiltrie.”— —“O if ye had asked me castels and towirs, I wad hae gin them two or thrie: But a' the monie in fair Scotland Winna buy the lyfe of Ochiltrie.”— The queen she trippet down the stair, And down she gaed right mournfullie— —“It's a' the monie in fair Scotland Winna buy the lyfe of Ochiltrie.”— Lady Margaret tore her yallow hair, When as the queen tald hir the saim; —“I'll take a knife and end my lyfe, And be in the grave as soon as him.”— —“Ah na! fie na!” quoth the queen, —“Fie na! fie na! this maunna be; I'll set ye on a better way To loose and set him free.”— The queen she slippet up the stair, And she gaid up richt privatly, And she has stoun the prison-keys, And gane and set Ochiltrie frie. And she's gien him a purse of gowd, And another of whyt monie, She's gien him twa pistols by's side, Saying to him,—“Shute when ye win frie.”— And when he cam to the queen's window, Whaten a joyfou shute gae he! —“Peace be to our royal queen, And peace be in her companie!”— “O whaten a voice is that?” quoth the king; “Whaten a voice is that?” quoth he: “Whaten a voice is that?” quoth the king; “I think its the voice of Ochiltrie.”— —“Call to me a' my jailours, Call them by thirtie and by thrie; Whairfor the morn, at twelve a clock, Its hangit shall they ilk ane be.”— —“O didna ye send your keyis to us? Ye sent them be thirtie and by thrie; And wi' them sent a strait command, To set at large young Ochiltrie.”— —“Ah na! fie na!” quoth the queen, —“Fie, my dear luve! this maunna be: And if ye're gawn to hang theim a', Indeed ye maun begin wi' me.”— The tane was shippit at the pier of Leith, The ither at the Queensferrie; And now the lady has gotten hir luve, The winsom laird of Ochiltrie.

Green Flodden! on thy blood-stained head Descend no rain nor vernal dew; But still, thou charnel of the dead, May whitening bones thy surface strew! Soon as I tread thy rush-clad vale, Wild fancy feels the clasping mail; The rancour of a thousand years Glows in my breast; again I burn To see the bannered pomp of war return, And mark, beneath the moon, the silver light of spears. Lo! bursting from their common tomb, The spirits of the ancient dead Dimly streak the parted gloom, With awful faces, ghastly red; As once, around their martial king, They closed the death-devoted ring, With dauntless hearts, unknown to yield; In slow procession round the pile Of heaving corses, moves each shadowy file, And chaunts, in solemn strain, the dirge of Flodden field. What youth, of graceful form and mien, Foremost leads the spectred brave? While o'er his mantle's folds of green His amber locks redundant wave? When slow returns the fated day That viewed their chieftain's long array, Wild to the harp's deep, plaintive string, The virgins raise the funeral strain, From Ord's black mountain to the northern main, And mourn the emerald hue which paints the vest of spring. Alas! that Scotish maid should sing The combat where her lover fell! That Scotish bard should wake the string, The triumph of our foes to tell! Yet Teviot's sons, with high disdain, Have kindled at the thrilling strain That mourned their martial fathers' bier; And, at the sacred font, the priest Thro' ages left the master hand unblest, To urge, with keener aim, the blood-encrusted spear. Red Flodden! when thy plaintive strain, In early youth, rose soft and sweet, My life-blood, thro' each throbbing vein, With wild tumultuous passion beat. And oft, in fancied might, I trode The spear-strewn path to Fame's abode, Encircled with a sanguine flood; And thought I heard the mingling hum, When, croaking hoarse, the birds of carrion come Afar, on rustling wing, to feast on English blood. Rude border chiefs, of mighty name, And iron soul, who sternly tore The blossoms from the tree of fame, And purpled deep their tints with gore, Rush from brown ruins, scarred with age, That frown o'er haunted Hermitage; Where, long by spells mysterious bound, They pace their round with lifeless smile, And shake, with restless foot, the guilty pile, Till sink the mouldering towers beneath the burdened ground. Shades of the dead! on Alfer's plain Who scorned with backward step to move, But, struggling mid the hills of slain, Against the Sacred Standard strove; Amid the lanes of war I trace Each broad claymore and ponderous mace: Where'er the surge of arms is tost, Your glittering spears, in close array, Sweep, like the spider's filmy web, away The flower of Norman pride, and England's victor host. But distant fleets each warrior ghost, With surly sounds that murmur far; Such sounds were heard when Syria's host Roll'd from the walls of proud Samàr. Around my solitary head Gleam the blue lightnings of the dead, While murmur low the shadowy band— “Lament no more the warrior's doom: “Blood! blood alone, should dew the hero's tomb, “Who falls, mid circling spears, to save his native land.” END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. MINSTRELSY OF THE SCOTTISH BORDER. PART SECOND. ROMANTIC BALLADS. SCOTISH MUSIC. AN ODE. BY J. LEYDEN. TO IANTHE. Again, sweet Syren, breathe again That deep, pathetic, powerful strain; Whose melting tones, of saddest woe, Fall soft as evening's summer dew, That bathes the pinks and harebells blue Which in the vales of Tiviot blow. Such was the song that soothed to rest, Far in the green isle of the west, The Celtic warrior's parted shade; Such are the lonely sounds that sweep O'er the blue bosom of the deep, Where ship-wrecked mariners are laid. Ah! sure, as Hindú legends tell, When music's tones the bosom swell, The scenes of former life return; Ere, sunk beneath the morning star, We left our parent climes afar, Immured in mortal forms to mourn. Or if, as ancient sages ween, Departed spirits, half-unseen, Can mingle with the mortal throng; 'Tis when from heart to heart we roll The deep-toned music of the soul, That warbles in our Scotish song. I hear, I hear, with awful dread, The plaintive music of the dead: They leave the amber fields of day. Soft as the cadence of the wave That murmurs round the mermaid's grave, They mingle in the magic lay. Sweet Syren, breathe the powerful strain! Lochroyan's Damsel sails the main; The chrystal tower enchanted see! “Now break,” she cries, “ye fairy charms!”— As round she sails with fond alarms, —“Now break, and set my true love free!”— Lord Barnard is to greenwood gone, Where fair Gil Morrice sits alone, And careless combs his yellow hair; Ah! mourn the youth, untimely slain! The meanest of Lord Barnard's train The hunter's mangled head must bear. Or, change these notes of deep despair, For love's more soothing tender air: Sing, how, beneath the greenwood tree, Brown Adam's love maintained her truth, Nor would resign the exiled youth For any knight the fair could see. And sing the Hawk of pinion gray, To southern climes who winged his way, For he could speak as well as fly; Her brethren how the fair beguiled, And on her Scotish lover smiled, As slow she raised her languid eye. Fair was her cheek's carnation glow, Like red blood on a wreath of snow; Like evening's dewy star her eye: White, as the sea mew's downy breast, Borne on the surge's foamy crest, Her graceful bosom heaved the sigh. In youth's first morn, alert and gay, Ere rolling years had passed away, Remembered like a morning dream, I heard these dulcet measures float, In many a liquid winding note, Along the banks of Teviot's stream. Sweet sounds! that oft have soothed to rest The sorrows of my guileless breast, And charmed away mine infant tears: Fond memory shall your strains repeat, Like distant echoes, doubly sweet, That in the wild the traveller hears. And thus, the exiled Scotian maid, By fond alluring love betrayed, To visit Syria's date-crowned shore; In plaintive strains, that soothed despair, Did “Bothwell's banks that bloom so fair,” And scenes of early youth, deplore. Soft Syren! whose enchanting strain Floats wildly round my raptured brain, I bid your pleasing haunts adieu! Yet, fabling fancy oft shall lead My footsteps to the silver Tweed, Thro' scenes that I no more must view. THE GAY GOSS HAWK. —“O waly, waly, my gay goss hawk, Gin your feathering be sheen!”— —“And waly, waly, my master dear, Gin ye look pale and lean! “O have ye tint, at tournament, Your sword or yet your spear? Or mourn ye for the southern lass, Whom you may not win near?”— —“I have not tint, at tournament, My sword, nor yet my spear; But sair I mourn for my true love, Wi' mony a bitter tear. “But weel's me on ye, my gay goss hawk, Ye can baith speak and flee; Ye sall carry a letter to my love, Bring an answer back to me.”— —“But how sall I your true love find, Or how suld I her know? I bear a tongue, ne'er wi' her spake, An eye that ne'er her saw.”— —“O weel sall ye my true love ken, Sae sune as ye her see; For, of a' the flowers of fair England, The fairest flower is she. “The red, that's on my true love's cheik, Is like blood drops on the snaw; The white, that is on her breast bare, Like the down o' the white sea-maw. “And even at my love's bour door, There grows a flowering birk; And ye maun sit and sing thereon, As she gangs to the kirk. “And four and twenty fair ladyes Will to the mass repair; But weel may ye my ladye ken, The fairest ladye there.”— Lord William has written a love letter, Put it under his pinion gray; And he is awa to southern land, As fast as wings can gae. And even at that ladie's bour, There grew a flowering birk; And he sat down and sang thereon, As she gaed to the kirk. And weel he kent that ladye feir, Amang her maidens free; For the flower that springs in May morning Was not sae sweet as she. And first he sang a low low note, And syne he sang a clear; And aye the o'er word of the sang Was—“Your love can no win here.” —“Feast on, feast on, my maidens a': The wine flows you amang: While I gang to my shot window, And hear yon bonny bird's sang. “Sing on, sing on, my bonny bird, The sang ye sung yestreen; For weel I ken, by your sweet singing, Ye are frae my true love sen'.”— O first he sang a merry sang, And syne he sang a grave; And syne he peck'd his feathers gray, To her the letter gave. —“Have there a letter from Lord William; He says he's sent ye three: He canna wait your love langer, But for your sake he'll die.”— —“Gae bid him bake his bridal bread, And brew his bridal ale; And I sall meet him at Mary's kirk, Lang, lang, ere it be stale.”— The ladye's gane to her chamber, And a moanfu' woman was she; As gin she had ta'en a sudden brash, And were about to die. —“A boon, a boon, my father deir, A boon I beg of thee!”— —“Ask not that paughty Scotish lord, For him you ne'er shall see. “But, for your honest asking else, Weel granted it shall be.”— —“Then, gin I die in southern land, In Scotland gar bury me. “And the first kirk that ye come to, Ye's gar the mass be sung; And the next kirk that ye come to, Ye's gar the bells be rung. “And, when ye come to St Mary's kirk, Ye's tarry there till night.”— And so her father pledged his word, And so his promise plight. She has ta'en her to her bigly bour, As fast as she could fare; And she has drank a sleepy draught, That she had mixed wi' care. And pale, pale, grew her rosy cheek, That was sae bright of blee; And she seemed to be as surely dead, As any one could be. They drapt a drap o' the burning red gowd, They drapt it on her chin; —“And ever alas!” her mother cried, “There is nae life within!”— They drapt a drap o' the burning red gowd, They drapt it on her breast bane; —“Alas!” her seven bauld brothers said, “Our sister's dead and gane.”— Then up arose her seven brethren, And hew'd to her a bier; They hew'd it frae the solid aik, Laid it o'er wi' silver clear. Then up and gat her seven sisters, And sewed to her a kell; And every steek that they pat in, Sew'd to a siller bell. The first Scots kirk that they cam to, They gar'd the bells be rung; The next Scots kirk that they cam to, They gar'd the mass be sung. But when they cam to St Mary's kirk, There stude spearmen all on raw; And up and started Lord William, The chieftane amang them a'. —“Set down, set down, the bier,” he said; “Let me looke her upon:”— But as soon as Lord William touched her hand, Her colour began to come. She brightened like the lily flower, Till her pale colour was gone; With rosy cheek, and ruby lip, She smiled her love upon. —“A morsel of your bread, my lord, And one glass of your wine: For I hae fasted these three lang days, All for your sake and mine.— “Gae hame, gae hame, my seven bauld brothers; Gae hame and blaw your horn: I trow you wad hae gien me the skaith, But I've gien you the scorn.”— —“Ah! woe to you, you light woman! An ill death may you die! For we left father and mother at hame, Breaking their hearts for thee.”— BROWN ADAM. O wha wad wish the wind to blaw, Or the green leaves fa' therewith? Or wha' wad wish a lealer love Than Brown Adam the Smith? But they hae banished him, Brown Adam, Frae father and frae mother; And they hae banished him, Brown Adam, Frae sister and frae brother. And they hae banished him, Brown Adam, The flow'r o' a' his kin; And he's bigged a bour in gude green wood, Atween his ladye and him. It fell upon a summer's day, Brown Adam he thought lang; And for to hunt some venison, To green wood he wald gang. He has ta'en his bow his arm o'er, His bolts and arrows lang; And he is to the gude green wood, As fast as he could gang. O he's shot up, and he's shot down, The bird upon the brier: And he's sent it hame to his ladye, Bade her be of gude cheir. O he's shot up, and he's shot down, The bird upon the thorn; And sent it hame to his ladye, Said he'd be hame the morn. When he cam to his ladye's bour door, He stude a little forebye; And there he heard a fou' fause knight Tempting his gaye ladye. For he has ta'en out a gay goud ring, Had cost him mony a poun'— —“O grant me love for love, ladye, And this sall be thy own.”— —“I lo'e Brown Adam weel,” she said; “I trew sae does he me: I wadna gie Brown Adam's love For nae fause knight I see.”— Out has he ta'en a purse o' gowd, Was a' fou to the string— —“O grant me love for love, ladye, And a' this sall be thine.”— —“I loe Brown Adam weel,” she says; “I wot sae does he me: I wadna be your light lemman, For mair than ye could gie.” Then out he drew his lang bright brand, And flashed it in her een— —“Now grant me love for love, ladye, Or thro' ye this sall gang!”— Then, sighing, says that ladye fair— —“Brown Adam tarries lang!”— Then in and starts him Brown Adam, Says—“I'm just at your hand.”— He's gar'd him leave his bonny bow, He's gar'd him leave his brand, He's gar'd him leave a dearer pledge— —Four fingers o' his right hand. JELLON GRAME. O Jellon Grame sat in Silverwood, He sharp'd his broad sword lang, And he has call'd his little foot page, An errand for to gang. —“Win up, my bonny boy,” he says, “As quickly as ye may; For ye maun gang for Lillie Flower, Before the break of day.”— The boy has buckled his belt about, And thro' the green wood ran; And he came to the ladye's bower, Before the day did dawn. —“O sleep ye, wake ye, Lillie Flower? The red sun's on the rain: Ye're bidden come to Silverwood, But I doubt ye'll never win hame.”— She had na ridden a mile, a mile, A mile but barely three, Ere she cam to a new made grave, Beneath a green aik tree. O then up started Jellon Grame, Out of a bush there bye— —“Light down, light down, now, Lillie Flower, For it's here that ye maun lye.”— She lighted aff her milk-white steed, And kneel'd upon her knee— —“O mercy, mercy, Jellon Grame, For I'm no prepared to die! “Your bairn, that stirs between my sides, Maun shortly see the light; But to see it weltering in my blood, Would be a piteous sight.”— —“O should I spare your life,” he says, “Until that bairn were born, Full weel I ken your auld father Would hang me on the morn.”— —“O spare my life! now, Jellon Grame; My father ye need na dread: I'll keep my babe in gude green wood, Or wi' it I'll beg my bread.”— He took no pity on Lillie Flower, Tho' she for life did pray; But pierced her thro' the fair body, As at his feet she lay. He felt nae pity for Lillie Flower, Where she was lying dead; But he felt some for the bonny bairn, That lay weltering in her bluid. Up has he ta'en that bonny boy, Given him to nurses nine; Three to sleep, and three to wake, And three to go between. And he bred up that bonny boy, Call'd him his sister's son; And he thought no eye could ever see The deed that he had done. O so it fell, upon a day, When hunting they might be, They rested them in Silverwood, Beneath that green aik tree. And mony were the green wood flowers Upon the grave that grew, And marvell'd much that bonny boy To see their lovely hue. —“What's paler than the prymrose wan? What's redder than the rose? What's fairer than the lilye flower, On this wee know that grows?”— O out and answered Jellon Grame, And he spake hastilie— —“Your mother was a fairer flower, And lies beneath this tree. More pale she was, when she sought my grace, Than prymrose pale and wan; And redder than rose her ruddy heart's blood, That down my broad sword ran.”— Wi' that the boy has bent his bow, It was baith stout and lang; And thro' and thro' him, Jellon Grame, He gar'd an arrow gang. Says—“Lie ye there, now, Jellon Grame; My malisoun gang you wi'! The place my mother lies buried in Is far too good for thee.”— WILLIE's LADYE. Willie's ta'en him o'er the faem, He's wooed a wife, and brought her hame; He's wooed her for her yallow hair, But his mother wrought her meikle care: And meikle dolour gar'd her drie, For lighter she can never be, But in her bour she sits wi' pain, And Willie mourns o'er her in vain. And to his mother he has gane, That vile rank witch, o' vilest kind! He says—“My ladye has a cup, Wi' gowd and silver set about, This gudely gift sall be your ain, And let her be lighter o' her young bairn.”— —“Of her young bairn she's never be lighter, Nor in her bour to shine the brighter; But she sall die, and turn to clay, And you shall wed another May.”— —“Another May I'll never wed, Another May I'll never bring hame.”— But, sighing, said that weary wight— —“I wish my life were at an end! “Yet gae ye to your mother again, That vile rank witch, o' vilest kind! And say, your ladye has a steed, The like o' him's no in the land of Leed. “For he is silver shod before, And he is gowden shod behind; At every tuft of that horse main, There's a golden chess, and a bell to ring. This gudely gift sall be her ain, And let me be lighter o' my young bairn.”— —“Of her young bairn she's ne'er be lighter, Nor in her bour to shine the brighter; But she sall die, and turn to clay, And ye sall wed another May.”— —“Another May I'll never wed, Another May I'll ne'er bring hame.”— But, sighing, said that weary wight— —“I wish my life were at an end! “Yet gae ye to your mither again, That vile rank witch, o' rankest kind! And say, your ladye has a girdle, It is a' red gowd to the middle; “And aye, at ilka siller hem Hangs fifty siller bells and ten; This gudely gift sall be her ain, And let me be lighter o' my young bairn.”— —“Of her young bairn she's ne'er be lighter, Nor in your bour to shine the brighter; For she sall die, and turn to clay, And thou sall wed another May.”— —“Another May I'll never wed, Another May I'll never bring hame.”— But, sighing, said that weary wight— “I wish my days were at an end!”— Then out and spake the Billy-blind— (He spak ay in a gude time:) —“Yet gae ye to the market place, And there do buy a loaf of wace; Do shape it bairn and bairnly like, And in it twa glassen e'en you'll put; “And bid her your boy's christening to, Then notice weel what she shall do; And do ye stand a little away, To notice weel what she may saye.— —“O wha has loosed the nine witch knots That were amang that ladye's locks? And what's ta'en out the kaims o' care, That were amang that ladye's hair? “And wha has ta'en downe that bush o' woodbine, That hung between her bour and mine? And wha has kill'd the master kid, That ran beneath that ladye's bed? And wha has loosed her left foot shee, And let that ladye lighter be!!”— Syne, Willy's loosed the nine witch knots, That were amang that ladye's locks; And Willy's ta'en out the kaims o' care, That were into that ladye's hair; And he's ta'en down the bush o' woodbine, Hung atween her bour and the witch carline; And he has kill'd the master kid, That ran beneath that ladye's bed; And he has loosed her left foot shee, And latten that ladye lighter be; And now he has gotten a bonny son, And meikle grace be him upon. CLERK SAUNDERS. Clerk Saunders and May Margaret Walked ower yon garden green; And sad and heavy was the love That fell thir twa between. —“A bed, a bed,” Clerk Saunders said, “A bed for you and me.”— —“Fye na, fye na,” said May Margaret, “Till anes we married be. “For in may come my seven bauld brothers, Wi' torches burning bright; They'll say—“We hae but ae sister, And behold she's wi' a knight!”— —“Then take the sword frae my scabbard, And slowly lift the pin; And you may swear, and safe your aith, Ye never let Clerk Saunders in. “And take a napkin in your hand, And tie up baith your bonny een; And you may swear, and safe your aith, Ye saw me na since late yestreen.”— It was about the midnight hour, When they asleep were laid; When in and came her seven brothers, Wi' torches burning red. When in and came her seven brothers, Wi' torches shining bright; They said “We hae but ae sister, And behold her lying with a knight!”— Then out and spake the first o' them,— —“I bear the sword shall gar him die.”— And out and spake the second o' them,— —“His father has nae mair than he!”— And out and spake the third o' them,— —“I wot that they are lovers dear.”— And out and spake the fourth o' them,— —“They hae been in love this mony a year.”— Then out and spake the fifth o' them,— —“It were great sin true love to twain.”— And out and spake the sixth o' them,— —“It were shame to slay a sleeping man!”— Then up and gat the seventh o' them, And never a word spake he; But he has striped his bright brown brand Out thro' Clerk Saunders' fair bodye. Clerk Saunders he started, and Margaret she turned Into his arms as asleep she lay; And sad and silent was the night That was atween thir twae. And they lay still and sleeped sound, Until the day began to daw; And kindly to him she did say, —“It is time, true love, you were awa'.”— But he lay still, and sleeped sound, Albeit the sun began to sheen; She looked atween her and the wa', And dull and drowsie were his een. Then in and came her father dear, Said—“Let a' your mourning be: I'll carry the dead corpse to the clay, And I'll come back and comfort thee.”— —“Comfort weel your seven sons; For comforted will I never be: I ween 'twas neither knave nor lown Was in the bower last night wi' me.”— The clinking bell gaed thro' the town, To carry the dead corse to the clay; And Clerk Saunders stood at May Margaret's window, I wot, an hour before the day. —“Are ye sleeping, Margaret?” he says, “Or are ye waking presentlie? Gie me my faith and troth again, I wot, true love, I gied to thee.”— —“Your faith and troth ye sall never get, Nor our true love sall never twin, Until ye come within my bower, And kiss me cheik and chin.”— —“My mouth it is full cold, Margaret, It has the smell, now, of the ground; And, if I kiss thy comely mouth, Thy days of life will not be lang. “O cocks are crowing a merry mid night, I wot the wild fowls are boding day; Give me my faith and troth again, And let me fare me on my way.”— —“Thy faith and troth thou sall na get, And our true love sall never twin, Untill ye tell what comes of women, I wot, who die in strong traivelling?”— —“Their beds are made in the heavens high, Down at the foot of our good Lord's knee, Weel set about wi' gillyflowers: I wot sweet company for to see. “O cocks are crowing a merry mid night, I wot the wild fowl are boding day; The psalms of heaven will soon be sung, And I ere now will be missed away.”— Then she has ta'en a chrystal wand, And she has stroken her troth thereon; She has given it him out at the shot window, Wi' mony a sad sigh, and heavy groan. —“I thank ye, Marg'ret; I thank ye, Marg'ret; And aye I thank ye heartilie; Gin ever the dead come for the quick, Be sure, Marg'ret, I'll come for thee.” It's hosen and shoon, and gown alone, She climbed the wall and followed him, Untill she came to the green forest; And there she lost the sight o' him. —“Is there ony room at your head, Saunders, Is there ony room at your feet? Or ony room at your side, Saunders, Where fain, fain, I wad sleep.”— —“There's nae room at my head, Marg'ret, There's nae room at my feet; My bed it is full lowly now: Amang the hungry worms I sleep. “Cauld mould is my covering now, But and my winding sheet; The dew it falls nae sooner down, Than my resting place is weet.” EARL RICHARD. —“O lady, rock never your young son young, One hour langer for me; For I have a sweetheart, in Garlioch Wells, I love far better than thee. “The very sole o' that ladye's foot Than thy face is far mair white.”— —“But, nevertheless, now, Erl Richard, Ye will bide in my bower a' night?”— She birled him wi' the ale and wine, As they sat down to sup; A living man he laid him down. But I wot he ne'er rose up. Then up and spake the popinjay, That flew aboun her head;— —“Lady! keep weel your grene cleiding Frae gude Erl Richard's bleid.”— —“O better I'll keep my grene cleiding Frae gude Erl Richard's bleid, Than thou canst keep thy clattering toung, That trattles in thy head.”— She has call'd upon her bower maidens, She has call'd them ane by ane;— —“There lies a deid man in my bour: I wish that he were gane.”— They hae booted him, and spurred him. As he was wont to ride; A hunting horn tied round his waist, A sharp sword by his side, And they hae had him to the wan water, For a' men call it Clyde. Then up and spake the popinjay, That sat upon the tree— —“What hae ye done wi' Erl Richard? Ye were his gaye ladye.”— —“Come down, come down, my bonny bird, And sit upon my hand; And thou sall hae a cage o' gowd, Where thou hast but the wand.”— —“Awa! awa! ye ill woman: Nae cage o' gowd for me; As ye hae dune to Erl Richard, Sae wad ye do to me.”— O it fell anes, upon a day, The king was boun' to ride; And he has mist him, Erl Richard, Should hae ridden on his right side. The ladye turn'd her round about, Wi meikle mournfu' din— —“It fears me sair o' Clyde water, That he is drown'd therein.”— —“Gar douk, gar douk,” the king he cried, “Gar douk for gold and fee; O wha will douk for Erl Richard's sake. Or wha will douk for me?”— They douked in at ae weil-head, And out aye at the other— —“We can douk nae mair for Erl Richard, Altho' he were our brother.”— It fell that, in that ladye's castle, The king was boun' to bed; And up and spake the popinjay That flew abune his head. —“Leave off your douking on the day, And douk upon the night; And wherever that sackless knight lies slain. The candles will burn bright.”— —“O there's a bird, within this bower, That sings baith sad and sweet; O there's a bird within your bower, Keeps me frae my night's sleep.”— They left the douking on the day, And douked upon the night; And, where that sackless knight lay slain, The candles burned bright. The deepest pot in a' the linn, They fand Erl Richard in; A grene turf tyed across his breast, To keep that gude lord down. Then up and spake the king himsell, When he saw the deadly wound— —“O wha has slain my right hand man, That held my hawk and hound?”— Then up and spake the popinjay, Says—“What needs a' this din? It was his light lemman took his life, And hided him in the linn.”— She swore her by the grass sae grene, Sae did she by the corn, She had na' seen him, Erl Richard, Since Moninday at morn. —“Put na the wyte on me,” she said; “It was my may Catherine.”— Then they hae cut baith fern and thorn, To burn that maiden in. It wadna take upon her cheik, Nor yet upon her chin; Nor yet upon her yellow hair, To cleanse the deadly sin. Out they hae ta'en her, may Catherine, And put her mistress in: The flame tuik fast upon her cheik, Tuik fast upon her chin, Tuik fast upon her fair bodye— She burn'd like hollins grene. THE LASS OF LOCHROYAN. —“O wha will shoe my bonny foot, And wha will glove my hand? And wha will lace my middle jimp Wi' a lang lang linen band? “O wha will kame my yellow hair With a new made silver kame? And wha will father my young son, Till Lord Gregory come hame?”— —“Thy father will shoe thy bonny foot, Thy mother will glove thy hand, Thy sister will lace thy middle jimp, Till Lord Gregory come to land. “Thy brother will kame thy yellow hair With a new made silver kame; And God will be thy bairn's father, Till Lord Gregory come hame.”— —“But I will get a bonny boat, And I will sail the sea; And I will gang to Lord Gregory, Since he canna come hame to me.”— Syne she's gar'd build a bonny boat, To sail the salt salt sea: The sails were o' the light-green silk, The tows o' taffety. She hadna sailed but twenty leagues, But twenty leagues and three, When she met wi' a rank robber, And a' his company. —“Now whether are ye the queen hersell, (For so ye weel might be:) Or are ye the Lass of Lochroyan, Seekin' Lord Gregory?”— —“O I am neither the queen,” she said, “Nor sic I seem to be; But I am the Lass of Lochroyan, Seekin' Lord Gregory.”— —“O see na thou yon bonny bower? It's a' covered o'er wi' tin: When thou hast sailed it round about, Lord Gregory is within.”— And when she saw the stately tower, Shining sae clear and bright, Whilk stood aboon the jawing wave, Built on a rock of height; Says—“Row the boat, my mariners, And bring me to the land; For yonder I see my love's castle, Close by the salt sea strand.”— She sailed it round, and sailed it round, And loud, loud, cried she— —“Now break, now break, ye fairy charms, And set my true love free!”— She's ta'en her young son in her arms, And to the door she's gane; And long she knocked, and sair she ca'd, But answer got she nane. —“O open the door, Lord Gregory! O open, and let me in! For the wind blaws through my yellow hair, And the rain drops o'er my chin.”— —“Awa, awa, ye ill woman! Ye're no come here for good: Ye're but some witch, or wil warlock, Or mermaid o' the flood!”— —“I am neither witch nor wil warlock, Nor mermaid o' the sea; But I am Annie of Lochroyan; O open the door to me!”— —“Gin thou be Annie of Lochroyan, (As I trow thou binna she:) Now tell me some o' the love tokens That past between thee and me.”— —“O dinna ye mind, Lord Gregory, As we sat at the wine, We changed the rings frae our fingers? And I can shew thee thine. “O your's was gude and gude enough, But ay the best was mine; For your's was o' the gude red gowd, But mine o' the diamond fine. “And has na thou mind, Lord Gregory, As we sat on the hill, Thou twin'd me o' my maidenheid, Right sair against my will? “Now, open the door, Lord Gregory; Open the door, I pray! For thy young son is in my arms, And will be dead ere day.”— —“If thou be the Lass of Lochroyan, (As I kenna thou be;) Tell me some mair o' the love tokens Past between me and thee.”— Fair Annie turned her round about— —“Weel! since that it be sae, May never woman, that has borne a son, Hae a heart sae fu' o' wae. “Take down, take down, that mast o' gowd; Set up a mast o' tree: It disna become a forsaken lady To sail sae royallie.”— When the cock had crawn, and the day did dawn, And the sun began to peep, Then up and raise him, Lord Gregory, And sair sair did he weep. —“O I hae dreamed a dream, mother, —I wish it may prove true! That the bonny Lass of Lochroyan Was at the yate e'en now. “O I hae dreamed a dream, mother, —The thought o't gars me greet! That fair Annie o' Lochroyan Lay cauld dead at my feet.”— —“Gin it be for Annie o' Lochroyan, That ye make a' this din, She stood a' last night at your door; But I trow she wan na in.”— —“O wae betide ye, ill woman! An ill deid may ye die! That wadna open the door to her, Nor yet wad waken me.”— O he's gane down to you shore side, As fast as he could fare; He saw fair Annie in the boat, But the wind it tossed her sair. —“And hey Annie! and how Annie! O Annie, winna ye bide?”— But ay the mair he cried Annie, The braider grew the tide. —“And hey Annie! and how Annie! Dear Annie, speak to me!”— But ay the louder he cried Annie, The louder roared the sea. The wind blew loud, the sea grew rough, And dashed the boat on shore; Fair Annie floated through the faem, But the babie raise no more. Lord Gregory tore his yellow hair, And made a heavy moan; Fair Annie's corpse lay at his feet, Her bonny young son was gone. O cherry cherry was her cheek, And gowden was her hair; But clay cold were her rosy lips— Nae spark o' life was there. And first he kissed her cherry cheek, And syne he kissed her chin; And syne he kissed her rosy lips— There was nae breath within. —“O wae betide my cruel mother! An ill death may she die! She turned my true love frae my door, Wha came sae far to me. “O wae betide my cruel mother! An ill death may she die! She turned fair Annie frae my door, Wha died for love o' me.”— ROSE THE RED AND WHITE LILLY. O Rose the Red, and White Lilly, Their mother deir was dead; And their father has married an ill woman, Wished them twa little guid. But she had twa as gallant sons, As ever brake man's bread; And the tane o' them lo'ed her, White Lilly, And the tother Rose the Red. O bigged ha' they a bigly bour, Fast by the roaring strand; And there was mair mirth in the ladyes' bour, Nor in a' their father's land. But out and spake their step-mother, As she stude a little forebye— —“I hope to live and play the prank, Sall gar your loud sang lie.”— She's call'd upon her eldest son— —“Cum here, my son, to me: It fears me sair, my Bauld Arthur, That ye maun sail the sea.”— —“Gin sae it maun be, my deir mother, Ye're bidding I maun dee; But, be never waur to Rose the Red, Than ye hae been to me.’”— She's call'd upon her youngest son— —“Cum here, my son, to me: It fears me sair, my Brown Robin, That ye maun sail the sea.”— —“Gin it fear ye sair, my mother deir, Ye're bidding I sall dee; But, be never waur to White Lilly, Than ye hae been to me.”— —“Now haud your tongues, ye foolish boys! For small sall be their part: They ne'er again sall see your face, Gin their very hearts suld break.”— Sae Bauld Arthur's gane to our king's court, His hie chamberlain to be; But Brown Robin, he has slain a knight, And to grene wood he did flee. When Rose the Red, and White Lilly, Saw their twa loves were gane, Sune did they drop the loud loud sang. Took up the still mourning. And out then spake her White Lilly— —“My sister, we'll be gane: Why suld we stay in Barnisdale, To mourn our bour within?”— O cutted hae they their grene cloathing, A little abune their knee; And sae hae they their yellow hair, A little abune their bree. And left hae they that bonny bour, To cross the raging sea; And they hae ta'en to a holy chapel, Was christen'd by Our Ladye. And they hae changed their twa names, Sae far frae ony toun; And the tane o' them's hight Sweet Willie, And the tother's Rouge the Rounde. Between the twa a promise is, And they hae sworn it to fulfill; Whenever the tane blew a bugle horn, The tother suld cum her till. Sweet Willy's gane to the king's court, Her true love for to see; And Rouge the Rounde to gude grene wood, Brown Robin's man to be. O it fell anes, upon a time, They putted at the stane; And seven foot ayont them a', Brown Robin's gar'd it gang. She lifted the heavy putting stane, And gave a sad “O hon!”— Then out bespake him Brown Robin— —“But that's a woman's moan!”— —“O kent ye by my rosy lips, Or by my yellow hair; Or kent ye by my milk-white breast, Ye never yet saw bare?”— —“I kent na by your rosy lips, Nor by your yellow hair; But cum to your bour whaever likes, They'll find a ladye there.”— —“O gin ye come my bour within, Thro' fraud, deceit, or guile, Wi' this same brand, that's in my hand, I vow I will thee kill.”— —“Yet durst I cum into your bour, And ask nae leave,” quo' he; “And, wi' this same brand, that's in my hand, Wave danger back on thee.”— About the dead hour o' the night, The ladye's bour was broken; And, about the first hour o' the day, The fair knave bairn was gotten. When days were gane, and months were come, The lady was sad and wan; And aye she cried for a bour woman, For to wait her upon. Then up and spake him, Brown Robin— —“And what needs this?” quo' he: “Or what can woman do for you, That canna be done by me?”— —“'Twas never my mother's fashion,” she said, “Nor shall it e'er be mine, That belted knights should e'er remain While ladyes dree'd their pain. “But, gin ye take that bugle horn, And wind a blast sae shrill, I hae a brother in yonder court, Will cum me quickly till.”— —“O gin ye hae a brother on earth, That ye lo'e mair than me, Ye may blaw the horn yoursell,” he says, “For a blast I winna gie.”— She's ta'en the bugle in her hand, And blawn baith loud and shrill; Sweet William started at the sound, And cam her quickly till. O up and starts him, Brown Robin, And swore by Our Ladye— —“No man shall cum into this bour, But first maun fight wi' me.”— O they hae fought the wood within, Till the sun was going down; And drops o' blood, frae Rose the Red, Came pouring to the ground. She leant her back against an aik, Said—“Robin, let me be; For it is a ladye, bred and born, That has fought this day wi' thee.”— O seven foot he started back, Cried—“Alas and woe is me! For I wished never, in all my life, A woman's bluid to see: “And that all for the knightly vow I swore to Our Ladye; But mair for the sake o' ae fair maid, Whose name was White Lilly.”— Then out and spake her, Rouge the Rounde, And leugh right heartilie— —“She has been wi' you this year and mair, Though ye wistna it was she.”— Now word has gane thro' a' the land, Before a month was gane, That a forester's page, in gude grene wood, Had borne a bonny son.— The marvel gaed to the king's court, And to the king himsell— —“Now, by my fay,” the king did say, “The like was never heard tell!”— Then out and spake him, Bauld Arthur, And laugh'd right loud and hie— —“I trow some may has plaid the lown, And fled her ain countrie.”— —“Bring me my steid!” the king can say; My bow and arrows keen; And I'll gae hunt in yonder wood, And see what's to be seen.”— —“Gin it please your grace,” quo' Bauld Arthur, “My liege, I'll gang you wi'; And see gin I can meet a bonny page, That's stray'd awa frae me.”— And they hae chaced in gude grene wood, The buck but and the rae, Till they drew near Brown Robin's bour, About the close o' day. Then out and spake the king himsell, Says—“Arthur, look and see Gin yon be not your favourite page, That leans against yon tree.” O Arthur's ta'en a bugle horn, And blawn a blast sae shrill; Sweet Willy started to her feet, And ran him quickly till. —“O wanted ye your meat, Willie? Or wanted you your fee? Or gat ye e'er an angry word, That ye ran awa frae me?”— —“I wanted nought, my master dear; To me ye aye was good: I cam to see my ae brother, That wons in this grene wood.”— Then out bespake the king again— —“My boy, now tell to me, Who dwells into yon bigly bour, Beneath you grene aik tree?”— —“O pardon me,” said Sweet Willy; “My liege I dare na tell; And gang na near yon outlaw's bour, For feir they suld you kill.”— —“O haud your tongue, my bonny boy, For I winna be said nay; But I will gang yon bour within, Betide me weal or wae.”— They have lighted frae their milk-white steids, And saftly entered in; And there they saw her, White Lilly, Nursing her bonny young son. —“Now, by the mass,” the king he said, “This is a comely sight; I trow, instead of a forester's man, This is a ladye bright!”— O out and spake her, Rose the Red, And fell low on her knee: —“O pardon us, my gracious liege, And our story I'll tell thee. “Our father is a wealthy lord, Lives into Barnisdale; But we had a wicked step-mother, That wrought us meikle bale. “Yet had she twa as fu' fair sons, As e'er the sun did see; And the tane o' them lo'ed my sister deir, And the tother said he lo'ed me.”— Then out and cried him, Bauld Arthur, As by the king he stood, —“Now, by the faith of my body, This suld be Rose the Red!” The king has sent for robes o' grene, And girdles o' shining gold; And sae sune have the ladyes busked themselves, Sae glorious to behold. Then in and came him, Brown Robin, Frae hunting o' the king's deer; But when he saw the King himsell, He started back for fear. The king has ta'en Robin by the hand, And bade him nothing dread, But quit for aye the gude grene wood, And cum to the court wi' speed. The king has ta'en White Lilly's son, And set him on his knee; Says—“Gin ye live to wield a brand, My bowman thou sall be.”— They have ta'en them to the holy chapelle, And there had fair wedding; And when they cam to the king's court, For joy the bells did ring. FAUSE FOODRAGE. King Easter has courted her for her lands, King Wester for her fee; King Honor for her comely face, And for her fair bodie. They had not been four months married. As I have heard them tell, Untill the nobles of the land Against them did rebel. And they cast kevils them amang, And kevils them between; And they cast kevils them amang, Wha suld gae kill the king. O some said yea, and some said nay, Their words did not agree; Till up and got him Fause Foodrage, And swore it suld be he. When bells were rung, and mass was sung, And a' men bound to bed, King Honor and his gaye ladye In a hie chamber were laid. Then up and raise him, Fause Foodrage, When a' were fast asleep; And slew the porter in his lodge, That watch and ward did keep. O four and twenty silver keys Hang hie upon a pin; And aye, as ae door he did unlock, He has fastened it him behind. Then up and raise him, King Honor, Says—“What means a' this din? Or what's the matter, Fause Foodrage, Or wha has loot you in?”— —“O ye my errand weel shall learn, Before that I depart.”— Then drew a knife, baith lang and sharp, And pierced him to the heart. Then up and got the Queen hersell, And fell low down on her knee; —“O spare my life! now, Fause Foodrage, For I never injured thee. “O spare my life! now, Fause Foodrage, Untill I lighter be; And see gin it be lad or lass, King Honor has left me wi'.”— —“O gin it be a lass,” he says, “Weel nursed it shall be; But gin it be a lad bairn, He sall be hanged hie. “I winna spare for his tender age, Nor yet for his hie, hie, kin; But soon as e'er he born is, He shall mount the gallows pin.”— O four and twenty valiant knights Were set the Queen to guard; And four stood aye at her bour door, To keep both watch and ward. But when the time drew near an end, That she suld lighter be, She cast about to find a wile To set her body free. O she has birled these merry young men With the ale but and the wine, Untill they were as deadly drunk As any wild wood swine. —“O narrow, narrow, is this window, And big, big, am I grown!”— Yet, thro' the might of Our Ladye, Out at it she has gone. She wandered up, she wandered down, She wandered out and in; And at last, into the very swine's stythe, The Queen brought forth a son. Then they cast kevils them amang, Which sould gae seek the Queen; And the kevil fell upon Wise William, And he sent his wife for him. O when she saw Wise William's wife, The Queen fell on her knee; —“Win up, win up, Madame!” she says: “What needs this courtesie?”— —“O out o' this I winna rise, Till a boon ye grant to me; To change your lass for this lad bairn, King Honor left me wi'. “And ye maun learn my gay goss hawk Right weel to breast a steed; And I sall learn your turtle dow As weel to write and read. “And ye maun learn my gay goss hawk To wield baith bow and brand; And I sall learn your turtle dow To lay gowd wi' her hand. At kirk and market when we meet, We'll dare make nae avowe, But—“Dame, how does my gay goss hawk?”— —“Madame, how does my dow?”— When days were gane, and years came on, Wise William he thought lang; And he has ta'en King Honor's son A hunting for to gang. It sae fell out, at this hunting, Upon a simmer's day, That they came by a fair castell, Stood on a sunny brae. —“O dinna ye see that bonny castell, Wi' halls and towers sae fair? Gin ilka man had back his ain, Of it ye suld be heir.”— —“How I suld be heir of that castell In sooth I canna see; For it belangs to Fause Foodrage, And he is na kin to me.”— —“O gin ye suld kill him, Fause Foodrage, You would do but what was right; For I wot he kill'd your father dear, Or ever ye saw the light. “And gin ye suld kill him, Fause Foodrage, There is no man durst you blame; For he keeps your mother a prisoner, And she darna take ye hame.”— The boy stared wild like a gray goss hawk: Says—“What may a' this mean?”— —“My boy, ye are King Honor's son; And your mother's our lawful Queen.”— —“O gin I be King Honor's son, By Our Ladye I swear, This night I will that traitor slay, And relieve my mother dear!”— He has set his bent bow to his breast, And leaped the castell wa'; And soon has he seized on Fause Foodrage, Wha loud for help 'gan ca'.— —“O haud your tongue, now, Fause Foodrage! Frae me ye shanna flee.”— Syne, pierc'd him thro' the fause, fause, heart, And set his mother free. And he has rewarded Wise William Wi' the best half of his land; And sae has he the turtle dow, Wi' the truth o' his right hand. KEMPION. —“Cum heir, cum heir, ye freely feed, And lay your head low on my knee; The heaviest weird I will you read, That ever was read to gaye ladye. “O meikle dolour sall ye dree, And aye the salt seas o'er ye'se swim; And far mair dolour sall ye dree On Estmere crags, when ye them climb. “I weird ye to a fiery beast, And relieved sall ye never be, Till Kempion, the kingis son, Cum to the crag, and thrice kiss thee.”— O meikle dolour did she dree, And aye the salt seas o'er she swam; And far mair dolour did she dree On Estmere crags, e'er she them clamb. And aye she cried for Kempion, Gin he would but cum to her hand; Now word has gane to Kempion, That sicken a beast was in his land. —“Now, by my sooth,” said Kempion, “This fiery beast I'll gang and see.”— —“And, by my sooth,” said Segramour, “My ae brother, I'll gang wi' thee.”— Then bigged hae they a bonny boat, And they hae set her to the sea; But a mile before they reached the shore, Around them she gar'd the red fire flee. —“O Segramour, keep the boat afloat, And let her na the land o'er near; For this wicked beast will sure gae mad, And set fire to a' the land and mair.”— Syne has he bent an arblast bow, And aim'd an arrow at her head; And swore if she didna quit the land, Wi' that same shaft to shoot her dead. —“O out o' my stythe I winna rise, And it is not for the awe o' thee, Till Kempion, the kingis son, Cum to the crag, and thrice kiss me.” He has louted him o'er the dizzy crag, And gien the monster kisses ane: Awa she gaed and again she cam, The fieryest beast that ever was seen. —“O out o' my stythe I winna rise, And not for a' thy bow nor thee, Till Kempion, the kingis son, Cum to the crag, and thrice kiss me.”— He's louted him o'er the Estmere crags, And he has gien her kisses twa: Awa she gaed and again she cam, The fieryest beast that ever you saw. —“O out of my den I winna rise, Nor flee it for the feir o' thee; Till Kempion, that courteous knight, Cum to the crag, and thrice kiss me.”— He's louted him o'er the lofty craig, And he has gien her kisses three: Awa she gaed and again she cam, The loveliest ladye e'er could be! —“And by my sooth,” says Kempion, “My ain true love, (for this is she:) They surely had a heart o' stane, Could put thee to such misery. “O was it warwolf in the wood, Or was it mermaid in the sea? Or was it man, or vile woman, My ain true love, that mishaped thee?”— —“It was na warwolf in the wood, Nor was it mermaid in the sea; But it was my wicked step-mother, And wae and weary may she be!”— —“O a heavier weird shall light her on, Than ever fell on vile woman; Her hair shall grow rough, and her teeth grow lang, And on her four feet shall she gang. “None shall take pity her upon; In Wormeswood she aye shall won; And relieved shall she never be, Till St Mungo come over the sea.”— And sighing said that weary wight, —“I doubt that day I'll never see!”— LORD THOMAS and FAIR ANNIE. —“It's narrow, narrow, make your bed, And learn to lie your lane, For I'm ga'n o'er the sea, Fair Annie, A braw bride to bring hame; Wi' her I will get gowd and gear, Wi' you I ne'er got nane. “But wha will bake my bridal bread, Or brew my bridal ale; And wha will welcome my brisk bride, That I bring o'er the dale?”— —“It's I will bake your bridal bread, And brew your bridal ale; And I will welcome your brisk bride That you bring o'er the dale.”— —“But she that welcomes my brisk bride Maun gang like maiden fair; She maun lace on her robe sae jimp, And braid her yellow hair.”— —“But how can I gang maiden like, When maiden I am nane? Have I not borne seven sons to thee, And am with child again?”— She's ta'en her young son in her arms, Another in her hand; And she's up to the highest tower, To see him come to land. —“Come up, come up, my eldest son, And look o'er yon sea strand, And see your father's new come bride, Before she come to land.”— —“Come down, come down, my mother dear! Come frae the castle wa'; I fear, if langer ye stand there, Ye'll let yoursell down fa'.”— And she gaed down, and farther down, Her love's ship for to see; And the top-mast and the main-mast Shone like the silver free. And she's gane down, and farther down, The bride's ship to behold; And the topmast and the mainmast They shone just like the gold. She's ta'en her seven sons in her hand, I wot she didna fail; She met Lord Thomas and his bride, As they cam o'er the dale. —“You're welcome to your house, Lord Thomas, You're welcome to your land; You're welcome with your fair ladye, That you lead by the hand. “You're welcome to your ha's, ladye, You're welcome to your bowers; You're welcome to your hame, ladye, For a' that's here is your's.”— —“I thank thee, Annie, I thank thee, Annie, Sae dearly as I thank thee; You're the likest to my sitser, Annie, That ever I did see.— “There came a knight out o'er the sea, And steal'd my sister away; The shame scoup in his company, And land where'er he gae!”— She hang ae napkin at the door, Another in the ha'; And a' to wipe the trickling tears, Sae fast as they did fa'. And aye she served the lang tables, With white bread and with wine; And aye she drank the wan water, To had her colour fine. And aye she served the lang tables, With white bread and with brown, And aye she turned her round about, Sae fast the tears fall down. And he's ta'en down the silk napkin, Hung on a silver pin; And aye he wipes the tear trickling A' down her cheik and chin. And aye he turned him round about, And smil'd amang his men: Says—“Like ye best the old ladye, Or her that's new come hame?”— When bells were rung, and mass was sung, And a' men bound to bed, Lord Thomas and his new come bride, To their chamber they were gaed. Annie made her bed a little forebye, To hear what they might say; —“And ever alas!” fair Annie cried, “That I should see this day. “Gin my seven sons were seven young rats, Running on the castle wa', And I were a grey cat mysell, I soon would worry them a'. “Gin my seven sons were seven young hares, Running o'er yon lilly lee, And I were a grew hound mysell, Soon worried they a' should be.”— And wae and sad fair Annie sat, And drearie was her sang; And ever as she sobb'd and grat, —“Wae to the man that did the wrang.”— —“My gown is on,” said the new come bride, “My shoes are on my feet, And I will to fair Annie's chamber, And see what gars her greet.— “What ails ye, what ails ye, fair Annie, That ye make sic a moan? Has your wine barrels cast the girds, Or is your white bread gone? “O wha was't was your father, Annie, Or wha was't was your mother? And had ye any sister, Annie, Or had ye any brother?”— —“The Earl of Wemyss was my father, The Countess of Wemyss my mother; And a' the folk about the house, To me were sister and brother.”— —“If the Earl of Wemyss was your father, I wot sae was he mine, And it shall not be for lack o' gowd, That ye your love sall tine. “For I have seven ships o' mine ain, A' loaded to the brim, And I will gie them a' to thee, Wi' four to thine eldest son; But thanks to a' the powers in heaven, That I gae maiden hame.”— THE WIFE OF USHER's WELL. A FRAGMENT. There lived a wife at Usher's Well, And a wealthy wife was she; She had three stout and stalwart sons, And sent them o'er the sea. They hadna been a week from her, A week but barely ane, Whan word came to the carline wife, That her three sons were gane. They hadna been a week from her A week but barely three, Whan word came to the carlin wife, That her sons she'd never see. —“I wish the wind may never cease, Nor fishes in the flood, Till my three sons come hame to me, In earthly flesh and blood.”— It fell about the Martinmass, When nights are lang and mirk, The carlin wife's three sons came hame, And their hats were o' the birk. It neither grew in syke nor ditch, Nor yet in ony sheugh; But at the gates o' paradise, That birk grew fair eneugh. —“Blow up the fire, my maidens; Bring water from the well: For a' my house shall feast this night, Since my three sons are well.”— And she has made to them a bed, She's made it large and wide; And she's ta'en her mantle her about, Sat down at the bed-side. Up then crew the red red cock, And up and crew the gray; The eldest to the youngest said, —“'Tis time we were away.”— The cock he hadna craw'd but once, And clapp'd his wings at a', When the youngest to the eldest said, —“Brother, we must awa. “The cock doth craw, the day doth daw, The channerin' worm doth chide; Gin we be mist out o' our place, A sair pain we maun bide. “Fare ye weel, my mother dear! Fareweel to barn and byre! And fare ye weel, the bonny lass, That kindles my mother's fire.”— COSPATRICK. Cospatrick has sent o'er the faem, Cospatrick brought his ladye hame; And fourscore ships have come her wi', The ladye by the grenewood tree. There were twal' and twal' wi' baken bread, And twal' and twal' wi' gowd sae reid, And twal' and twal' wi' bouted flour, And twal' and twal' wi' the paramour. Sweet Willy was a widow's son, And at her stirrup he did run; And she was clad in the finest pall, But aye she let the tears down fall. —“O is your saddle set awrye? Or rides your steed for you owre high? Or are ye mourning, in your tide, That you suld be Cospatrick's bride?”— —“I am not mourning, at this tide, That I suld be Cospatrick's bride; But I am sorrowing, in my mood, That I suld leave my mother good. “But, gentle boy, come tell to me, What is the custom of thy countrye?”— —“The custom thereof, my dame,” he says, “Will ill a gentle ladye please. “Seven king's daughters has our lord wedded, And seven king's daughters has our lord bedded; But he's cutted their breasts frae their breast bane, And sent them mourning hame again. “Yet, gin you're sure that you're a maid, Ye may gae safely to his bed; But gif o' that ye be na sure, Then hire some damsell o' your bour.”— The ladye's call'd her bour maiden, That waiting was into her train; —“Five thousand merks I will gie thee, To sleep this night with my lord for me.”— When bells were rung, and mass was sayne, And a' men unto bed were gane, Cospatrick and the bonny maid, Into ae chamber they were laid. —“Now, speak to me, blankets, and speak to me, bed; And speak, thou sheet, inchanted web; And speak up, my bonny brown sword, that winna lie, Is this a true maiden that lies by me?”— —“It is not a maid that you hae wedded, But it is a maid that you hae bedded; It is a liel maiden that lies by thee, But not the maiden that it should be.”— O wrathfully he left the bed, And wrathfully his claiths on did: And he has ta'en him thro' the ha', And on his mother he did ca'. —“I am the most unhappy man, That ever was in christen land! I courted a maiden meik and mild, And I hae gotten naething but a woman wi' child.”— —“O stay my son into this ha', And sport ye wi' your merrymen a'; And I will to the secret bour, To see how it fares wi' your paramour. The carline she was stark and sture, She aff the hinges dang the dure; —“O is your bairn to laird or loun, Or is it to your father's groom?”— —“O! hear me, mother, on my knee, Till my sad story I tell thee: O we were sisters, sisters seven, We were the fairest under heaven. “It fell on a summer's afternoon, When a' our toilsome task was done, We cast the kavils us amang, To see which suld to the grene wood gang. “O hon! alas, for I was youngest, And aye my wierd it was the hardest; The kavil it on me did fa', Whilk was the cause of a' my woe. “For to the grene wood I maun gae, To pu' the red rose and the slae; To pu' the red rose and the thyme, To deck my mother's bour and mine. “I hadna pu'd a flower but ane, When by there came a gallant hende, Wi' high coll'd hose and laigh coll'd shoon, And he seem'd to be sum king's son. “And be I maid, or be I nae, He kept me there till the close o' day; And be I maid, or be I nane, He kept me there till the day was done. “He gae me a lock o' his yellow hair, And bade me keep it ever mair; He gae me a carknet o' bonny beads, And bade me keep it against my needs. “He gae to me a gay gold ring, And bade me keep it abune a' thing.”— —“What did ye wi' the tokens rare, That ye gat frae that gallant there?”— —“O bring that coffer unto me, And a' the tokens ye sall see.”— —“Now stay, daughter, your bour within, While I gae parley wi' my son.”— Oh she has ta'en her thro' the ha', And on her son began to ca'; —“What did you wi' the bonny beads, I bade ye keep against your needs? “What did you wi' the gay gowd ring, I bade ye keep abune a' thing?”— —“I gae them a' to a ladye gay, I met in grene wood on a day. “But I wad gie a' my halls and tours, I had that ladye within my bours; But I wad gie my very life, I had that ladye to my wife.”— —“Now keep, my son, your ha's and tours; Ye have that bright burd in your bours: And keep, my son, your very life; Ye have that ladye to your wife.”— Now or a month was cum and gane, The ladye bore a bonny son; And 'twas weel written on his breast bane, Cospatrick is my father's name: —“O rowe my ladye in satin and silk, And wash my son in the morning milk.”— PRINCE ROBERT. Prince Robert has wedded a gay ladye, He has wedded her with a ring; Prince Robert has wedded a gay ladye, But he daur na bring her hame. —“Your blessing, your blessing, my mother dear; Your blessing now grant to me!”— —“Instead of a blessing ye sall have my curse, And you'll get nae blessing frae me.”— She has called upon her waiting maid, To fill a glass of wine; She has called upon her fause steward, To put rank poison in. She has put it to her roudes lip, And to her roudes chin; She has put it to her fause fause mouth, But the never a drop gaed in. He has put it to his bonny mouth, And to his bonny chin, He's put it to his cherry lip, And sae fast the rank poison ran in. —“O ye hae poisoned your ae son, mother, Your ae son and your heir; O ye hae poisoned your ae son, mother, And sons you'll never hae mair.”— —“O where will I get a little boy, That will win hose and shoon; To run sae fast to Darlinton, And bid fair Eleanor come.”— Then up and spake a little boy, That wad win hose and shoon: “—O I'll away to Darlinton, And bid fair Eleanor come.”— O he has run to Darlinton, And tirled at the pin; And wha was sae ready as Eleanor's sell, To let the bonny boy in. —“Your gude-mother has made ye a rare dinour, She's made it baith gude and fine; Your gude-mother has made ye a gay dinour, And ye maun cum till her and dine.”— It's twenty lang miles to Sillertoun town, The langest that ever were gane; But the steed it was wight, and the ladye was light, And she cam linkin' in. But when she came to Sillertoun town, And into Sillertoun ha', The torches were burning, the ladies were mourning, And they were weeping a'. —“Oh! where is now my wedded lord, And where now can he be? Oh! where is now my wedded lord, For him I canna see.”— —“Your wedded lord is dead,” she says, “And just gane to be laid in the clay; Your wedded lord is dead,” she says, “And just gane to be buried the day. “Ye'se get nane o' his gowd, ye'se get nane o' his gear, Ye'se get nane thing frae me; Ye'se na get an inch o' his gude broad land, Tho' your heart suld burst in three.” —“I want nane of his gowd, I want nane of his gear, I want nae land frae thee; But I'll hae the ring that's on his finger, For them he did promise to me.”— —“Ye'se na get the ring that's on his finger, Ye'se na get them frae me; Ye'se na get the ring that's on his finger, An' your heart suld burst in three.”— She's turned her back unto the wa', And her face unto a rock; And there, before the mother's face, Her very heart it broke. The tane was buried in Marie's kirk, The tother in Marie's quair; And out o' the tane there sprang a birk, And out o' the tother a brier. And thae twa met, and thae twa plat, The birk but and the brier; And by that ye may very weel ken They were twa lovers dear. KING HENRIE. THE ANCIENT COPY. Let never man a wooing wend, That lacketh thingis thrie: A rowth o' gold, an open heart, And fu' o' courtesey. And this was seen o' King Henrie, For he lay burd alane; And he has ta'en him to a haunted hunt's-ha', Was seven miles frae a toun. He's chaced the dun deer thro' the wood, And the roe doun by the den, Till the fattest buck, in a' the herd, King Henrie he has slain. He's ta'en him to his hunting ha', For to make burly cheir; When loud the wind was heard to sound, And an earthquake rocked the floor. And darkness cover'd a' the hall, Where they sat at their meat: The gray dogs, youling, left their food, And crept to Henrie's feet. And louder houled the rising wind, And burst the fast'ned door; And in there came a griesly ghost, Stood stamping on the floor. Her head touched the roof-tree of the house; Her middle ye well mot span: Each frighted huntsman fled the ha', And left the king alone. Her teeth were a' like tether stakes, Her nose like club or mell; And I ken nae thing she appeared to be, But the fiend that wons in hell. —“Sum meat, sum meat, ye King Henrie; Sum meat ye gie to me.”— —“And what meat's in this house, ladye, That ye're nae wellcum tee?”— —“O ye's gae kill your berry brown steed, And serve him up to me.”— O when he killed his berry brown steed, Wow gin his heart was sair! She eat him a' up, skin and bane, Left naething but hide and hair. —“Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henrie; Mair meat ye gie to me.”— —“And what meat's i' this house, ladye, That ye're na wellcum tee?”— —“O ye do slay your gude gray houndes, And bring them a' to me.”— O when he slew his gude gray houndes, Wow but his heart was sair! She's ate them a' up, ane by ane, Left naething but hide and hair. —“Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henrie; Mair meat ye gie to me.”— —“And what meat's i' this house, ladye, That I hae left to gie?”— —“O ye do fell your gay goss-hawks, And bring them a' to me.”— O when he felled his gay goss-hawks, Wow but his heart was sair! She's eat them a' up, bane by bane, Left naething but feathers bare. —“Sum drink, sum drink, ye king Henrie; Sum drink ye gie to me.”— —“And what drink's in this house, ladye, That ye're nae wellcum tee?”— —“O ye sew up your horse's hide, And bring in a drink to me.”— O he has sew'd up the bluidy hide, And put in a pipe of wine; She drank it up a' at ae draught, Left nae a drap therein. —“A bed, a bed, ye king Henrie; A bed ye mak to me.”— —“And what's the bed i' this house, ladye, That ye're nae wellcum tee?— —“O ye maun pu' the green heather, And mak a bed to me.”— O pu'ed has he the heather green, And made to her a bed; And up he has ta'en his gay mantle, And o'er it he has spread. —“Now swear, now swear, ye king Henrie, To take me for your bride.”— —“O God forbid,”—king Henrie said, “That e'er the like betide! That e'er the fiend that wons in hell, Should streak down by my side.”— When day was come, and night was gane, And the sun shone through the ha', The fairest ladye, that e'er was seen, Lay atween him and the wa'. —“O weel is me!”—king Henrie said; “How long will this last wi' me?”— And out and spak that ladye fair— —“E'en till the day ye die. “For I was witched to a ghastly shape, All by my stepdame's skill, Till I should meet wi' a courteous knight, Wad gie me a' my will.”— ANNAN WATER. —“Annan water's wading deep, And my love Annie's wondrous bonnie; And I am laith she shuld weet her feet, Because I love her best of ony. “Gar saddle me the bonny black; Gar saddle sune, and make him ready: For I will down the Gatehope-slack, And all to see my bonny ladye.”— He has loupen on the bonny black, He stirr'd him wi' the spur right sairly; But, or he wan the Gatehope-slack, I think the steed was wae and weary. He has loupen on the bonnie gray, He rade the right gate and the ready; I trow he would neither stint nor stay, For he was seeking his bonnie ladye. The gray was a mare, and a right good mare; But when she wan the Annan water, She could na hae ridden a furlong mair, Had a thousand merks been wadded at her. The side was stey, and the bottom deep, Frae bank to brae the water pouring; And the bonnie gray mare did sweat for fear, For she heard the water kelpy roaring. O he has pou'd aff his dapperpy coat, The silver buttons glanced bonny; The waistcoat bursted aff his breast, He was sae full of melancholy. He has ta'en the ford at that stream tail; I wot he swam both strong and steady; But the stream was broad, and his strength did fail, And he never saw his bonny ladye. —“O wae betide the frush saugh wand! And wae betide the bush of briar! It brake into my true love's hand, When his strength did fail, and his limbs did tire. “And wae betide ye, Annan water! This night that ye are a drumlie river; For over thee I'll build a bridge, That ye never more true love may sever.”— THE CRUEL SISTER. There were two sisters sat in a bour; Binnorie, O Binnorie; There came a knight to be their wooer; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. He courted the eldest with glove and ring; Binnorie, O Binnorie; But he lo'ed the youngest aboon a' thing; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. He courted the eldest with broach and knife; Binnorie, O Binnorie; But he lo'ed the youngest aboon his life; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. The eldest she was vexed sair; Binnorie, O Binnorie; And sore envied her sister fair; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. The eldest said to the youngest ane, Binnorie, O Binnorie; —“Will ye go and see our father's ships come in?”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. She's tae'n her by the lilly hand, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And led her down to the river strand; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. The youngest stude upon a stane, Binnorie, O Binnorie; The eldest came and pushed her in; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. She took her by the middle sma', Binnorie, O Binnorie; And dashed her bonnie back to the jaw, By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“O sister, sister, reach your hand, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And ye shall be heir of half my land.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“O sister, I'll not reach my hand, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And I'll be heir of all your land: By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“Shame fa' the hand that I should take, Binnorie, O Binnorie; It's twin'd me, and my world's make.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“O sister, reach me but your glove, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And sweet William shall be your love.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“Sink on, nor hope for hand or glove, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And sweet William shall better be my love.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“Your cherry cheeks and your yellow hair, Binnorie, O Binnorie; Garr'd me gang maiden evermair.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. Sometimes she sunk, and sometimes she swam, Binnorie, O Binnorie; Untill she came to the miller's dam, By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“O father, father, draw your dam! Binnorie, O Binnorie; There's either a mermaid or a milkwhite swan.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. The miller hasted and drew his dam, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And there he found a drowned woman, By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. You could not see her yellow hair, Binnorie, O Binnorie; For gowd and pearls that were sae rare, By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. You could na see her middle sma', Binnorie, O Binnorie; Her gowden girdle was sae bra'; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. A famous harper passing by, Binnorie, O Binnorie; The sweet pale face he chanced to spy; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. And when he looked that ladye on, Binnorie, O Binnorie; He sighed and made a heavy moan; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. He made a harp of her breast bone, Binnorie, O Binnorie; Whose sounds would melt a heart of stone; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. The strings he framed of her yellow hair, Binnorie, O Binnorie; Whose notes made sad the listening ear; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. He brought it to her father's hall; Binnorie, O Binnorie; And there was the court assembled all; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. He laid this harp upon a stone, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And straight it began to play alone; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. —“O yonder sits my father, the king, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And yonder sits my mother, the queen; By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. “And yonder stands my brother Hugh, Binnorie, O Binnorie; And by him my William sweet and true.”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. But the last tune that the harp play'd then, Binnorie, O Binnorie; Was “Woe to my sister, false Helen!”— By the bonny milldams of Binnorie. LAMENT OF THE QUEEN'S MARIE. —“O ye mariners, mariners, mariners, That sail upon the sea, Let not my father nor mother to wit, The death that I maun die!”— When she cam to the Netherbow port, She laughed loud laughters three; But when she cam to the gallows foot, The tear blinded her e'e. —“Yestreen the queen had four Maries, The night she'll hae but three; There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beatoun, And Marie Carmichael, and me.”— THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST. [Part First.] I've heard them lilting, at the ewe milking, Lasses a' lilting, before dawn of day; But now they are moaning, on ilka green loaning; The flowers of the forest are a' wede away. At bughts in the morning, nae blithe lads are scorning; Lasses are lonely, and dowie and wae; Nae daffing, nae gabbing, but sighing and sabbing; Ilk ane lifts her leglin, and hies her awae. In har'st at the shearing, nae youths now are jearing; Bandsters are runkled, and lyart or gray; At fair, or at preaching, nae wooing, nae fleeching; The flowers of the forest are a' wede awae. At e'en, in the gloaming, nae younkers are roaming 'Bout stacks, with the lasses at bogle to play; But ilk maid sits dreary, lamenting her deary— The flowers of the forest are weded awae. Dool and wae for the order, sent our lads to the border! The English, for ance, by guile wan the day; The flowers of the forest, that fought aye the foremost, The prime of our land are cauld in the clay. We'll hear nae mair lilting at the ewe milking; Women and bairns are heartless and wae: Sighing and moaning on ilka green loaning— The flowers of the forest are a' wede awae. PART SECOND. I've seen the smiling of fortune beguiling, I've tasted her favours, and felt her decay; Sweet is her blessing, and kind her caressing, But soon it is fled—it is fled far away. I've seen the forest adorned of the foremost, With flowers of the fairest, both pleasant and gay: Full sweet was their blooming, their scent the air perfuming, But now they are wither'd, and a' wede away. I've seen the morning with gold the hills adorning, And the red storm roaring before the parting day; I've seen Tweed's silver streams, glittering in the sunny beams, Turn drumly and dark as they rolled on their way. O fickle fortune! why this cruel sporting? Why thus perplex us poor sons of a day? Thy frowns cannot fear me, thy smiles cannot cheer me, Since the flowers of the forest are a' wede away. THE LAIRD OF MUIRHEAD. Afore the king in order stude The stout laird of Muirhead, Wi' that sam twa-hand muckle sword That Bartram felled stark deid. He sware he wadna lose his right To fight in ilka field; Nor budge him from his liege's sight, Till his last gasp should yield. Twa hunder mair, of his ain name, Frae Torwood and the Clyde, Sware they would never gang to hame, But a' die by his syde. And wondrous weil they kept their troth; This sturdy royal band Rush'd down the brae, wi' sic a pith, That nane cou'd them withstand. Mony a bludy blow they delt, The like was never seen; And hadna that braw leader fallen, They ne'er had slain the king. THE YOUNG TAMLANE. O I forbid ye, maidens a', That wear gowd on your hair, To come or gae by Carterhaugh; For young Tamlane is there. There's nane, that gaes by Carterhaugh, But maun leave him a wad; Either goud rings, or green mantles, Or else their maidenheid. But up then spake her, fair Janet, The fairest o' a' her kin; —“I'll come and gang to Carterhaugh, And ask nae leave o' him.”— Janet has kilted her green kirtle, A little aboon her knee; And she has braided her yellow hair, A little aboon her bree. And she's away to Carterhaugh, And gaed beside the wood; And there was sleeping young Tamlane, And his steed beside him stood. She pu'd the broom flower frae the bush, And strewed it on's white hause bane; And that was to be a witter true, That maiden she had gane. —“O where was ye, my milk white steed, That I did love sae dear, That wadna watch, and waken me, When there was maiden here?”— —“I stamped wi' my foot, master, I gar'd my bridle ring; But no kin' thing would waken ye, Till she was past and gane.”— —“And wae betide ye, my gray goshawk, That I did love sae well; That wadna watch, and waken me, When my love was here hersell!”— —“I clapped wi' my wings, master, And ay my bells I rang; And ay cried, “waken, waken, master, Afore your true love gang.”— —“But haste, and haste, my good white steed, To come the maiden till; Or a' the birds, in good green wood, O' your flesh shall hae their fill.”— —“Ye needna burst your good white steed, By running o'er the howm; Nae hare runs swifter o'er the lea, Nor your love ran thro' the broom.”— Fair Janet, in her green cleiding, Returned upon the morn; And she met her father's ae brother, The laird of Abercorn. —“I'll wager, I'll wager, I'll wager wi' you, Five hunder merk and ten, I'll maiden gang to Carterhaugh, And maiden come again.”— She princked hersell, and prin'd hersell, By the ae light of the moon; And she's away to Carterhaugh, As fast as she could win. And whan she cam to Carterhaugh, She gaed beside the wall; And there she fand his steed standing, But away was himsell. She hadna pu'd a red red rose, A rose but barely three, Till up and starts a wee wee man, At Lady Janet's knee. Says—“Why pu' ye the rose, Janet? What gars ye break the tree? Or why come ye to Carterhaugh, Withoutten leave o' me!”— Says—“Carterhaugh it is mine ain; My daddie gave it me; I'll come and gang to Carterhaugh, And ask nae leave o' thee.”— He's ta'en her by the milk-white hand, And by the grass-green sleeve; He's led her to the Fairy ground, And spier'd at her nae leave. When she came to her father's ha', She looked pale and wan; They thought she'd dried some sair sickness, Or been wi' some leman. She didna comb her yellow hair, Nor make meikle o' her heid; And ilka thing, that lady took, Was like to be her deid. Its four and twenty ladies fair Were in her father's ha'; Whan in there came the fair Janet, The flower amang them a'. Four and twenty ladies fair Were playing at the chess; And out there came the fair Janet, As green as any grass. Out and spake an auld gray-headed knight, Lay o'er the castle wa'— —“And ever alas! for thee, Janet, But we'll be blamed a'.”— —“Now had your tongue, ye auld gray knight! And an ill deid may ye die! Father my bairn on whom I will, I'll father nane on thee.”— Out then spake her father dear, And he spoke meek and mild— —“And ever alas! my sweet Janet, I fear ye gae with child.”— —“And if I be with child, father, Mysell maun bear the blame; There's ne'er a knight, about your ha', Shall hae the bairnie's name. “If my love were an earthly knight, As he's an elfin grey, I wadna gie my ain true love For nae lord that ye hae.”— —“Is it to a man o' might, Janet, Or is it to a man o' mean? Or is it unto young Tamlane, That's wi' the Fairies gane?”— —“Twas down by Carterhaugh, father, I walked beside the wa; And there I saw a wee wee man, The least that e'er I saw. “His legs were skant a shathmont lang, Yet umber was his thie; Between his brows there was ae span, And between his shoulders, thrie. “He's ta'en and flung a meikle stane, As far as I could see; I could na, had I been Wallace wight, Hae lifted it to my knee. “O wee wee man, but ye be strang! Where may thy dwelling be?”— —“Its down beside yon bonny bower; Fair lady, come and see.”— “On we lap, and away we rade, Down to a bonny green; We lighted down to bait our steed, And we saw the Fairy Queen. “With four and twenty at her back, Of ladies clad in green; Tho' the King of Scotland had been there, The worst might hae been his Queen. “On we lap, and away we rade, Down to a bonny ha'; The roof was o' the beaten goud, The floor was of chrystal a'. “And there were dancing on the floor, Fair ladies jimp and sma'; But, in the twinkling o' an eye, They sainted clean awa'. “And, in the twinkling of an eye, The wee wee man was gane; And he says, gin he binna won by me, He'll ne'er be won by nane.”— Janet's put on her green cleiding, Whan near nine months were gane; And she's awa to Carterhaugh, To speak wi' young Tamlane. And when she came to Carterhaugh, She gaed beside the wall; And there she saw the steed standing, But away was himsell. She hadna pu'd a double rose, A rose but only twae, When up and started young Tamlane, Says—“Lady, thou pu's nae mae! “Why pu' ye the rose, Janet, Within this garden green? And a' to kill the bonnie babe, That we got us between.”— —“The truth ye'll tell to me, Tamlane; A word ye mauna lie; Gin e'er ye was in haly chapel, Or sained in Christentie.”— —“The truth I'll tell to thee, Janet; A word I winna lie; A knight me got, and a lady me bore, As well as they did thee. “Roxburgh was my grandfather; Took me with him to bide; And, as we frae the hunting came, This harm did me betide. “Roxburgh was a hunting knight, And loved hunting well; And, on a cauld and frosty day, Down frae my horse I fell. “The Queen o' Fairies keppit me, In yon green hill to dwell; And I'm a fairy, lyth and limb; Fair lady, view me well. “And pleasant is the fairy land; But, an eiry tale to tell! Ay, at the end o' seven years, We pay the teind to hell; And I'm sae fair and fu' o' flesh, I'm fear'd it be mysell. “This night is Hallowe'en, Janet; The morn is Hallowday; And, gin ye dare your true love win, Ye have nae time to stay. “The night it is good Hallowe'en, When fairy folk will ride; And they, that wad their true love win, At Miles Cross they maun bide.”— —“But how shall I thee ken, Tamlane? Or how shall I thee knaw? Amang so many unearthly knights, The like I never saw?”— —“The first company that passes by, Say na, and let them gae; The next company that passes by, Say na, and do right sae; The third company that passes by, Then I'll be ane o' thae. “First let pass the black, Janet, And syne let pass the brown; But grip ye to the milk-white steed, And pu' the rider down. “For I ride on the milk-white steed, And ay nearest the town; Because I was a christened knight, They gave me that renown. “My right hand will be gloved, Janet, My left hand will be bare; And thae's the tokens I gie thee, Nae doubt I will be there. “They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, An adder and a snake; But had me fast, let me not pass, Gin ye wad be my maik. “They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, An adder and an ask; They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, A bale that burns fast. “They'll turn me in your arms, Janet, A red hot gad o' iron; But had me fast, let me not pass, For I'll do you no harm. “First, dip me in a stand o' milk, And then in a stand o' water; But had me fast, let me not pass, I'll be your bairn's father. “And next they'll shape me in your arms, A toad, but and an eel; But had me fast, nor let me gang, As you do love me weel. “They'll shape me in your arms, Janet, A dove, but and a swan; And last they'll shape me in your arms, A mother-naked man: Cast your green mantle over me— I'll be mysell again.”— Gloomy, gloomy, was the night, And eiry was the way, As fair Janet, in her green mantle, To Miles Cross she did gae. About the dead hour o' the night, She heard the bridles ring; And Janet was as glad o' that, As any earthly thing! And first gaed by the black black steed, And then gaed by the brown; But fast she gript the milk-white steed, And pu'd the rider down. She pu'd him frae the milk-white steed, And loot the bridle fa'; —And up there raise an erlish cry— —“He's won amang us a'!”— They shaped him in fair Janet's arms, An esk, but and an adder; She held him fast in every shape, To be her bairn's father. They shaped him in her arms at last, A mother-naked man; She wrapt him in her green mantle, And sae her true love wan. Up then spake the Queen o' Fairies, Out o' a bush o' broom— —“She that has borrowed young Tamlane, Has gotten a stately groom.” Up then spake the Queen o' Fairies, Out o' a bush of rye— —“She's ta'en awa the bonniest knight, In a' my companie. “But, had I kenn'd, Tamlane,” she says, “A lady wad borrowed thee— I wad ta'en out thy twae gray een, Put in twae een o' tree. “Had I but kenn'd, Tamlane,” she says, “Before ye came frae hame— I wad ta'en out your heart o' flesh, Put in a heart o' stane. “Had I had but the wit yestreen, That I hae coft the day— I'd paid my kane seven times to hell, Ere you'd been won away!”— THOMAS THE RHYMER. PART FIRST. True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank: A ferlie he spied wi' his ee; And there he saw a lady bright, Come riding down by the Eildon Tree. Her shirt was o' the grass green silk, Her mantle o' the velvet fyne; At ilka tett of her horse's mane, Hang fifty siller bells and nine. True Thomas, he pull'd aff his cap, And louted low down to his knee— —“All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heav'n! For thy peer on earth I never did see.”— —“O no, O no, Thomas,” she said; “That name does not belang to me; I am but the Queen of fair Elfland, That am hither come to visit thee. “Harp and carp, Thomas,” she said; “Harp and carp along wi' me: And if ye dare to kiss my lips, Sure of your bodie I will be.”— —“Betide me weal, betide me woe, That weird shall never danton me.”— Syne he has kissed her rosy lips, All underneath the Eildon Tree. —“Now, ye maun go wi' me,” she said; “True Thomas, ye maun go wi' me: And ye maun serve me seven years, Thro' weal or woe as may chance to be.”— She mounted on her milk-white steed; She's ta'en true Thomas up behind; And aye, whene'er her bridle rung, The steed flew swifter than the wind. O they rade on, and further on; The steed gaed swifter than the wind; Untill they reached a desart wide, And living land was left behind. —“Light down, light down, now, true Thomas, And lean your head upon my knee: Abide and rest a little space, And I will shew you ferlies three. “O see ye not yon narrow road, So thick beset wi' thorns and briers? That is the path of righteousness, Tho' after it but few enquires. “And see not ye that braid braid road, That lies across that lily leven? That is the path of wickedness, Tho' some call it the road to heaven. “And see not ye that bonny road, That winds about the fernie brae? That is the road to fair Elfland, Where thou and I this night maun gae. “But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue, Whatever ye may hear or see; For, if you speak word in Elflyn land, Ye'll ne'er get back to your ain countrie.”— O they rade on, and farther on, And they waded thro' rivers aboon the knee; And they saw neither sun nor moon, But they heard the roaring of the sea. It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern light, And they waded thro' red blude to the knee; For a' the blude that's shed on earth, Rins thro' the springs o' that countrie. Syne they came on to a garden green, And she pu'd an apple frae a tree— —“Take this for thy wages, true Thomas; It will give the tongue that can never lie.”— —“My tongue is mine ain,” true Thomas said; “A gudely gift ye wad gie to me! I neither dought to buy nor sell, At fair or tryst where I may be. “I dought neither speak to prince or peer, Nor ask of grace from fair ladye.”— —“Now hold thy peace!” the lady said, “For, as I say, so must it be.”— He has gotten a cloth of the even cloth, And a pair of shoes of velvet green; And, till seven years were gane and past, True Thomas on earth was never seen. PART SECOND. When seven years were come and gane, The sun blinked fair on pool and stream; And Thomas lay on Huntlie bank, Like one awakened from a dream. He heard the trampling of a steed; He saw the flash of armour flee; And he beheld a gallant knight, Come riding down by the Eildon Tree. He was a stalwart knight, and strong; Of giant make he 'peared to be: He stirr'd his horse, as he were wode, Wi' gilded spurs of fashioun free. Says—“Well met, well met, true Thomas! Some uncouth ferlies shew to me.”— Says—“Christ thee save, Corspatrick brave! Thrice welcome, good Dunbar, to me. “Light down, light down, Corspatrick brave, And I will shew thee curses three; Shall gar fair Scotland greet and grane, And change the green to the black livery. “A storm shall roar, this very hour, From Rosse's Hills to Solway sea.”— —“Ye lied, ye lied, ye warlock hoar! For the sun shines sweet on fauld and lea.”— He put his hand on the Earlie's head; He shew'd him a rock, beside the sea, Where a king lay stiff, beneath his steed, And steel-dight nobles wiped their ee. —“The neist curse lights on Branxton hills: By Flodden's high and heathery side, Shall wave a banner, red as blude, And chieftains throng wi' meikle pride. “A Scotish king shall come full keen; The ruddy lion beareth he: A feather'd arrow sharp, I ween, Shall make him wink and warre to see. “When he is bloody, and all to bledde, Thus to his men he still shall say— —“For God's sake, turn ye back again, And give yon southern folk a fray! Why should I lose the right is mine? My doom is not to die this day.”— “Yet turn ye to the eastern hand, And woe and wonder ye sall see; How forty thousand spearmen stand, Where yon rank river meets the sea. “There shall the lion lose the gylte, And the libbards bear it clean away; At Pinkyn Cleuch there sall be spilt Much gentil blude that day.”— —“Enough, enough, of curse and ban; Some blessing shew thou now to me; Or, by the faith o' my bodie,” Corspatrick said, “Ye sall rue the day ye e'er saw me!”— —“The first of blessings I sall thee shew, Is by a burn, that's call'd of bread; Where Saxon men shall tine the bow, And find their arrows lack the head. “Beside that brigg, out ower that burn, Where the water bickereth bright and sheen, Shall many a falling courser spurn, And knights shall die in battle keen. “Beside a headless cross of stone, The libbards there shall lose the gree; The raven shall come, the erne shall go, And drink the Saxon blude sae free. The cross of stone they shall not know, So thick the corses there shall be.”— —“But tell me now,” said brave Dunbar, “True Thomas, tell now unto me, What man shall rule the Isle Britain, Even from the north to the southern sea?”— —“A French Queen shall bear the son, Shall rule all Britain to the sea: He of the Bruce's blude shall come, As near as in the ninth degree. “The waters worship shall his race; Likewise the waves of the farthest sea; For they shall ride ower ocean wide, With hempen bridles, and horse of tree.”— PART THIRD. When seven years more had come and gone, Was war thro' Scotland spread; And Ruberslaw shew'd high Dunyon, His beacon blazing red. Then all by bonny Coldingknow, Pitched palliouns took their room; And crested helms, and spears a rowe, Glanced gaily thro' the broom. The Leader, rolling to the Tweed, Resounds the ensenzie; They roused the deer from Caddenhead, To distant Torwoodlee. The feast was spread in Erceldoune, In Learmont's high and ancient hall; And there were knights of great renown, And ladies laced in pall. Nor lacked they, while they sat at dine, The music, nor the tale; Nor goblets of the blood-red wine, Nor mantling quaighs of ale. True Thomas rose, with harp in hand, When as the feast was done; (In minstrel strife, in Fairy Land, The elfin harp he won.) Hush'd were the throng, both limb and tongue, And harpers for envy pale; And armed lords lean'd on their swords, And hearken'd to the tale. In numbers high, the witching tale The prophet pour'd along; No after bard might e'er avail Those numbers to prolong. Yet fragments of the lofty strain Float down the tide of years; As, buoyant on the stormy main, A parted wreck appears. He sung King Arthur's table round: The warrior of the lake; How courteous Gawaine met the wound, And bled for ladie's sake. But chief, in gentle Tristrem's praise, The notes melodious swell; Was none excell'd, in Arthur's days, The Knight of Lionelle. For Marke, his cowardly uncle's right, A venom'd wound he bore; When fierce Morholde he slew in fight, Upon the Irish shore. No art the poison might withstand; No medicine could be found, Till lovely Isolde's lilye hand Had probed the rankling wound. With gentle hand and soothing tongue, She bore the leech's part: And, while she o'er his sick-bed hung, He paid her with his heart. O fatal was the gift, I ween! For, doom'd in evil tide, The maid must be rude Cornwall's Queen, His cowardly uncle's bride. Their loves, their woes, the gifted bard In fairy tissue wove; Where lords, and knights, and ladies bright, In gay confusion strove. The Garde Joyeuese, amid the tale, High rear'd its glittering head; And Avalon's enchanted vale In all its wonders spread. Brangwain was there, and Segramore, And fiend-born Merlin's gramarye; Of that fam'd wizzard's mighty lore, O who could sing but he? Thro' many a maze the winning song In changeful passion led, Till bent at length the listening throng O'er Tristrem's dying bed. His ancient wounds their scars expand; With agony his heart is wrung: O where is Isolde's lilye hand, And where her soothing tongue? She comes! she comes! like flash of flame Can lovers' footsteps fly: She comes! she comes!—she only came To see her Tristrem die. She saw him die: her latest sigh Joined in a kiss his parting breath: The gentlest pair that Britain bare, United are in death. There paused the harp:—its lingering sound Died slowly on the ear; The silent guests still bent around, For still they seem'd to hear. Then woe broke forth in murmurs weak; Nor ladies heaved alone the sigh; But, half ashamed, the rugged cheek Did many a gauntlet dry. On Leader's stream, and Learmont's tower, The mists of evening close; In camp, in castle, or in bower, Each warrior sought repose. Lord Douglas, in his lofty tent, Dreamed o'er the woeful tale; When footsteps light, across the bent, The warrior's ears assail. He starts, he wakes:—“What, Richard, ho! Arise, my page, arise! What venturous wight, at dead of night, Dare step where Douglas lies!”— Then forth they rush'd: by Leader's tide, A selcouth sight they see— A hart and hind pace side by side, As white as snow on Fairnalie. Beneath the moon, with gesture proud, They stately move and slow; Nor scare they at the gathering crowd, Who marvel as they go. To Learmont's tower a message sped, As fast as page might run; And Thomas started from his bed, And soon his cloaths did on. First he woxe pale, and then woxe red; Never a word he spake but three: —“My sand is run; my thread is spun; This sign regardeth me.”— The elfin harp his neck around, In minstrel guise he hung; And on the wind, in doleful sound, Its dying accents rung. Then forth he went; yet turned him oft To view his ancient hall; On the grey tower, in lustre soft, The autumn moonbeams fall. And Leader's waves, like silver sheen, Danced shimmering in the ray; In deepening mass, at distance seen, Broad Soltra's mountains lay. —“Farewell, my father's ancient tower! A long farewell,” said he: “The scene of pleasure, pomp, or power, Thou never more shalt be. “To Learmont's name no foot of earth Shall here again belong; And, on thy hospitable hearth, The hare shall leave her young. “Adieu! Adieu!” again he cried; All as he turned him roun'— —“Farewell to Leader's silver tide! Farewell to Erceldoune!”— The hart and hind approached the place, As lingering yet he stood; And there, before Lord Douglas' face, With them he cross'd the flood. Lord Douglas leaped on his berry-brown steed, And spurr'd him the Leader o'er; But, tho' he rode with lightning speed, He never saw them more. Some sayd to hill, and some to glen, Their wond'rous course had been; But ne'er in haunts of living men Again was Thomas seen. THE BONNY HYND. COPIED FROM THE MOUTH OF A MILKMAID, IN 1771. O May she comes, and May she goes, Down by yon gardens green; And there she spied a gallant squire, As squire had ever been. And May she comes, and May she goes, Down by yon hollin tree; And there she spied a brisk young squire, And a brisk young squire was he. —“Give me your green manteel, fair maid; Give me your maidenhead! Give ye winna give me your green manteel, Give me your maidenhead!”— —“Perhaps there may be bairns, kind Sir; Perhaps there may be nane; But, if you be a courtier, You'l tell me soon your name.”— —“I am nae courtier, fair maid, But new come frae the sea; I am nae courtier, fair maid, But when I court wi' thee. “They call me Jack, when I'm abroad; Sometimes they call me John; But, when I'm in my father's bower, Jock Randal is my name.”— —“Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny lad! Sae loud's I hear ye lee! For I'm Lord Randal's ae daughter, He has nae mair nor me.”— —“Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny May! Sae loud's I hear ye lee! For I'm Lord Randal's ae ae son, Just now come o'er the sea.”— She's putten her hand down by her gare, And out she's ta'en a knife; And she has put it in her heart's bleed, And ta'en away her life. And he has ta'en up his bonny sister, With the big tear in his een; And he has buried his bonny sister, Amang the hollins green. And syne he's hyed him o'er the dale, His father dear to see— —“Sing, Oh! and Oh! for my bonny hynd, Beneath yon hollin tree!”— —“What needs you care for your bonny hynd? For it you need na care; Take you the best, gi' me the warst, Since plenty is to spare.”— —“I care no for your hynds, my lord; I care no for your fee; But, Oh! and Oh! for my bonny hynd, Beneath the hollin tree!”— —“O were ye at your sister's bower, Your sister fair to see, You'l think nae mair o' your bonny hynd, Beneath the hollin tree.”— O GIN MY LOVE WERE YON RED ROSE. O gin my love were yon red rose, That grows upon the castle wa', And I mysell a drap of dew, Down on that red rose I would fa'. O my love's bonny, bonny, bonny; My love's bonny and fair to see: Whene'er I look on her weel far'd face, She looks and smiles again to me. O gin my love were a pickle of wheat, And growing upon yon lily lee, And I mysell a bonny wee bird, Awa wi' that pickle o' wheat I wad flee. O my love's bonny, &amp;c. O gin my love were a coffer o' gowd, And I the keeper o' the key, I wad open the kist whene'er I list, And in that coffer I wad be. O my love's bonny, &amp;c. O TELL ME HOW TO WOO THEE. If doughty deeds my ladye please, Right soon I'll mount my steed; And strong his arm, and fast his seat, That bears frae me the meed. I'll wear thy colours in my cap, Thy picture in my heart; And he that bends not to thine eye, Shall rue it to his smart. Then tell me how to woo thee, love; O tell me how to woo thee! For thy dear sake, nae care I'll take, Tho' ne'er another trow me. If gay attire delight thine eye, I'll dight me in array; I'll tend thy chamber door all night, And squire thee all the day. If sweetest sounds can win thy ear, These sounds I'll strive to catch; Thy voice I'll steal to woo thysell, That voice that nane can match. Then tell me how to woo thee, love, O tell me how to woo thee; For thy dear sake, nae care I'll take, Tho' ne'er another trow me. But if fond love thy heart can gain, I never broke a vow; Nae maiden lays her skaith to me, I never loved but you. For you alone I ride the ring, For you I wear the blue; For you alone I strive to sing, O tell me how to woo. O tell me how to woo thee, love, O tell me how to woo thee; For thy dear sake, nae care I'll take, Tho' ne'er another trow me. MINSRELSY OF THE SCOTTISH BORDER. PART THIRD. IMITATIONS OF THE ANCIENT BALLAD. THE EVE OF SAINT JOHN. The Baron of Smaylho'me rose with day: He spurr'd his courser on, Without stop or stay, down the rocky way That leads to Brotherstone. He went not with the bold Buccleuch, His banner broad to rear; He went not 'gainst the English yew, To lift the Scotish spear. Yet his plate-jack was braced, and his helmet was laced, And his vaunt-brace of proof he wore; At his saddle-gerthe was a good steel sperthe, Full ten pound weight and more. The Baron return'd in three days space, And his looks were sad and sour; And weary was his courser's pace, As he reached his rocky tower. He came not from where Ancram Moor Ran red with English blood; Where the Douglas true, and the bold Buccleuch, 'Gainst keen Lord Evers stood. Yet was his helmet hack'd and hew'd, His acton pierc'd and tore; His axe and his dagger with blood embrued, But it was not English gore. He lighted at the Chapellage, He held him close and still; And he whistled thrice for his little foot page, His name was English Will. —“Come thou hither, my little foot page; Come hither to my knee; Though thou art young, and tender of age, I think thou art true to me. “Come, tell me all that thou hast seen; And look thou tell me true! Since I from Smaylho'me tower have been, What did thy lady do?”— —“My lady, each night, sought the lonely light, That burns on the wild Watchfold; For, from height to height, the beacons bright Of the English foemen told. “The bittern clamour'd from the moss, The wind blew loud and shrill; Yet the craggy pathway she did cross, To the eiry beacon hill. “I watch'd her steps, and silent came Where she sate her on a stone; No watchman stood by the dreary flame; It burned all alone. “The second night I kept her in sight, Till to the fire she came; And, by Mary's might, an armed knight Stood by the lonely flame. “And many a word that warlike lord Did speak to my lady there; But the rain fell fast, and loud blew the blast, And I heard not what they were. “The third night there the sky was fair, And the mountain blast was still, As again I watched the secret pair, On the lonesome beacon hill. “And I heard her name the midnight hour, And name this holy eve; And say, “Come this night to thy lady's bower; “Ask no bold Baron's leave. “He lifts his spear with the bold Buccleuch; “His lady is all alone; “The door she'll undo, to her knight so true, “On the eve of good St John.”— —“I cannot come; I must not come; “I dare not come to thee; “On the eve of St John I must wander alone: “In thy bower I may not be.”— —“Now, out on thee, faint-hearted knight! “Thou should'st not say me nay; “For the eve is sweet, and when lovers meet, “Is worth the whole summer's day. “And I'll chain the blood-hound, and the warder shall not sound, “And rushes shall be strewed on the stair; “So, by the black rood-stone, and by holy St John, “I conjure thee, my love, to be there.”— —“Though the blood-hound be mute, and the rush beneath my foot, “And the warder his bugle should not blow, “Yet there sleepeth a priest in the chamber to the east, “And my footstep he would know.”— —“O fear not the priest, who sleepeth to the east! “For to Dryburgh the way he has ta'en; “And there to say mass, till three days do pass, “For the soul of a knight that is slayne.”— “He turn'd him around, and grimly he frown'd; Then he laugh'd right scornfully— —“He who says the mass-rite for the soul of that knight, “May as well say mass for me. “At the lone midnight hour, when bad spirits have power, “In thy chamber will I be.”— With that he was gone, and my lady left alone, And no more did I see.”— Then changed, I trow, was that bold Baron's brow, From the dark to the blood-red high; —“Now, tell me the mein of the knight thou hast seen, For, by Mary, he shall die!”— —“His arms shone full bright, in the beacon's red light; His plume it was scarlet and blue; On his shield was a hound in a silver leash bound, And his crest was a branch of the yew.”— —“Thou liest, thou liest, thou little foot-page! Loud dost thou lie to me! For that knight is cold, and low laid in the mould, All under the Eildon tree.”— —“Yet hear but my word, my noble lord! For I heard her name his name; And that lady bright, she called the knight, Sir Richard of Coldinghame.”— The bold Baron's brow then changed, I trow, From high blood-red to pale. —“The grave is deep and dark, and the corpse is stiff and stark, So I may not trust thy tale. “Where fair Tweed flows round holy Melrose, And Eildon slopes to the plain, Full three nights ago, by some secret foe, That gay gallant was slain. “The varying light deceiv'd thy sight, And the wild winds drown'd the name; For the Dryburgh bells ring, and the white monks do sing, For Sir Richard of Coldinghame!”— He pass'd the court-gate, and he oped the tower grate, And he mounted the narrow stair, To the bartizan-seat, where, with maids that on her wait, He found his lady fair. That lady sat in mournful mood; Look'd over hill and vale; Over Tweed's fair flood, and Mertoun's wood, And all down Tiviotdale. —“Now hail! now hail! thou lady bright!”— —“Now hail! thou Baron true! What news, what news, from Ancram fight? What news from the bold Buccleuch?”— —“The Ancram Moor is red with gore, For many a southern fell; And Buccleuch has charged us evermore, To watch our beacons well.”— The lady blush'd red, but nothing she said; Nor added the Baron a word: Then she stepp'd down the stair to her chamber fair, And so did her moody lord. In sleep the lady mourn'd, and the Baron toss'd and turn'd, And oft to himself he said— —“The worms around him creep, and his bloody grave is deep: It cannot give up the dead!”— It was near the ringing of matin bell, The night was well nigh done, When a heavy sleep on that Baron fell, On the eve of good St John. The lady looked through the chamber fair, By the light of a dying flame; And she was aware of a knight stood there— Sir Richard of Coldinghame! —“Alas! away! away!” she cried, “For the holy Virgin's sake.”— —“Lady, I know who sleeps by thy side; But, Lady, he will not awake. “By Eildon-tree, for long nights three, In bloody grave have I lain; The mass and the death-prayer are said for me, But, Lady, they are said in vain. “By the Baron's brand, near Tweed's fair strand, Most foully slain I fell; And my restless sprite on the beacon's height, For a space is doom'd to dwell. “At our trysting-place, for a certain space, I must wander to and fro; But I had not had power to come to thy bower, Hads't thou not conjured me so.”— Love master'd fear—her brow she cross'd; —“How, Richard, hast thou sped? And art thou saved, or art thou lost?”— The vision shook his head! —“Who spilleth life, shall forfeit life; So bid thy lord believe: That lawless love is guilt above, This awful sign receive.”— He laid his left hand on an oaken stand, His right hand on her arm: The lady shrunk, and fainting sunk, For the touch was fiery warm. The sable score of fingers four Remains on that board impress'd; And for evermore that lady wore A covering on her wrist. There is a nun in Dryburgh bower, Ne'er looks upon the sun: There is a monk in Melrose tower, He speaketh word to none. That nun, who ne'er beholds the day, That monk, who speaks to none— That nun, was Smaylho'mes Lady gay, That monk, the bold Baron. LORD SOULIS. Lord Soulis he sat in Hermitage castle, And beside him Old Redcap sly; —“Now tell me, thou sprite, who art meikle of might, The death that I must die?”— —“While thou shalt bear a charmed life, And hold that life of me, 'Gainst lance and arrow, sword and knife, I shall thy warrant be. “Nor forged steel, nor hempen band, Shall e'er thy limbs confine, Till threefold ropes of sifted sand, Around thy body twine. “If danger press fast, knock thrice on the chest, With the rusty padlocks bound; Turn away your eyes when the lid shall rise, And listen to the sound.”— Lord Soulis he sat in Hermitage castle, And Redcap was not by; And he called on a page who was witty and sage, To go to the barmkin high. —“And look thou east, and look thou west, And quickly come tell to me, What troopers haste along the waste, And what may their livery be.”— He looked o'er fell, and he looked o'er flat, But nothing, I wist, he saw; Save a pyot on every turret that sat, Beside a corby craw. The page he look'd at the skrieh of day, But nothing, I wist, he saw; Till a horseman gay, in the royal array, Rode down the Hazel-shaw. —“Say, why do you cross o'er moor and moss?”— So loudly cried the page; —“I tidings bring, from Scotland's king, To Soulis of Hermitage. “He bids me tell that bloody warden, Oppressor of low and high, If ever again his lieges complain, The cruel Soulis shall die.”— By traitorous slight, they seized the knight, Before he rode or ran, And through the key-stone of the vault, They plunged him horse and man. O May she came, and May she gaed, By Goranberry green; And May she was the fairest maid, That ever yet was seen. O May she came, and May she gaed, By Goranberry tower; And who was it but cruel Lord Soulis, That carried her from her bower? He brought her to his castle gray, By Hermitage's side; Says—“Be content, my lovely May, For thou shalt be my bride.”— With her yellow hair that glittered fair, She dried the trickling tear; She sighed the name of Branxholm's heir, The youth that loved her dear. —“Now be content, my bonny May, And take it for your hame; Or ever and ay shall ye rue the day, You heard young Branxholm's name. “O'er Branxholm tower, ere the morning hour, When the lift is like lead so blue; The smoke shall roll white on the weary night, And the flame shine dimly through.”— Syne he's ca'd on him Ringan Red, A sturdy kemp was he; From friend or foe, in border feid, Who never a foot would flee. Red Ringan sped, and the spearmen led, Up Goranberry slack; Aye, many a wight, unmatched in fight, Who never more came back. And bloody set the westering sun, And bloody rose he up; But little thought young Branxholm's heir, Where he that night should sup. He shot the roe-buck on the lee, The dun deer on the law; The glammer sure was in his ee, When Ringan nigh did draw. O'er heathy edge, through rustling sedge, He sped till day was set; And he thought it was his merry men true, When he the spearmen met. Far from relief, they seized the chief, His men were far away; Through Hermitage slack, they sent him back, To Soulis' castle gray; Syne onward fure, for Branxholm tower, Where all his merry-men lay. —“Now welcome, noble Branxholm's heir! Thrice welcome,” quoth Soulis, “to me! Say, dost thou repair to my castle fair, My wedding guest to be: And lovely May deserves, per fay, A brideman such as thee!”— And broad and bloody rose the sun, And on the barmkin shone: When the page was aware of Red Ringan there, Who came riding all alone. To the gate of the tower Lord Soulis he speeds, As he lighted at the wall; Says—“Where did ye stable my stalwart steeds, And where do they tarry all?”— —“We stabled them sure, on the Tarras Muir; We stabled them sure,” quoth he: “Before we could cross that quaking moss, They all were lost but me.”— He clenched his fist, and he knocked on the chest, And he heard a stifled groan; And, at the third knock, each rusty lock Did open one by one. He turned away his eyes, as the lid did rise, And he listen'd silentlie; And he heard breathed slow, in murmurs low: —“Beware of a coming tree!”— In muttering sound the rest was drowned; Nor other word heard he; But slow as it rose, the lid did close, With the rusty padlocks three. Now rose with Branxholm's ae brother, The Tiviot, high and low; Bauld Walter by name, of meikle fame, For none could bend his bow. O'er glen and glade, to Soulis there sped The fame of his array; And that Tiviotdale would soon assail His towers and castle gray. With clenched fist, he knocked on the chest, And again he heard a groan; And he raised his eyes as the lid did rise, But answer heard he none. The charm was broke, when the spirit spoke; And it murmur'd sullenlie, —“Shut fast the door, and for evermore, Commit to me the key. “Alas! that ever thou raised'st thine eyes, Thine eyes to look on me! Till seven years are o'er, return no more, For here thou must not be.”— Think not but Soulis was wae to yield His warlock chamber o'er; He took the keys from the rusty lock, That ne'er were ta'en before. He threw them o'er his left shoulder, With meikle care and pain; And he bade it keep them, fathoms deep, Till he returned again. And still when seven years are o'er, Is heard the jarring sound; When slowly opes the charmed door Of the chamber under ground. And some, within the chamber door, Have cast a curious eye; But none dare tell, for the spirits in hell, The fearful sights they spy. When Soulis thought on his merrie men now, A woeful wight was he; Says—“Vengeance is mine, and I will not repine! But Branxholm's heir shall die.”— Says—“What would ye do, young Branxholm, Gin ye had me, as I have thee?”— —“I would take you to the good greenwood, And gar your ain hand wale the tree.”— —“Now shall thine ain hand wale the tree, For all thy mirth and meikle pride; And May shall chuse, if my love she refuse, A scrog bush thee beside.”— They carried him to the good greenwood, Where the green pines grew in a row; And they heard the cry, from the branches high, Of the hungry carrion crow. They carried him on from tree to tree, The spiry boughs below; —“Say, shall it be thine, on the tapering pine, To feed the hooded crow?”— —“The fir-tops fall by Branxholm wall, When the night blast stirs the tree; And it shall not be mine to die on the pine, I loved in infancie.”— Young Branxholm turned him, and oft looked back, And aye he passed from tree to tree; Young Branxholm peeped, and puirly spake, —“O sic a death is no for me.”— And next they passed the aspin gray; Its leaves were rustling mournfullie: —“Now chuse thee, chuse thee, Branxholm gay; Say, wilt thou never chuse the tree?”— —“More dear to me is the aspin gray, More dear than any other tree; For beneath the shade that its branches made, Have past the vows of my love and me.”— Young Branxholm peeped, and puirly spake, Until he did his ain men see; With witch's hazel in each steel cap, In scorn of Soulis's gramarye; Then shoulder height, for glee he lap, —“Methinks I spye a coming tree!”— —“Aye, many may come, but few return;”— Quo' Soulis, the lord of gramarye; —“No warrior's hand in fair Scotland Shall ever dint a wound on me!”— —“Now, by my sooth,” quo' bauld Walter, “If that be true we soon shall see.”— His bent bow he drew, and the arrow was true, But never a wound or scar had he. Then up bespake him, true Thomas, He was the lord of Ersyltoun: —“The wizard's spell no steel can quell, Till once your lances bear him down.”— They bore him down with lances bright, But never a wound or scar had he; With hempen bands they bound him tight, Both hands and feet on the Nine-stane lea. That wizzard accurst, the bands he burst; They mouldered at his magic spell; And neck and heel, in the forged steel, They bound him against the charms of hell. That wizzard accursed, the bands he burst; No forged steel his charms could bide; Then up bespake him, true Thomas, —“We'll bind him yet, whate'er betide.”— The black spae-book from his breast he took, Impressed with many a warlock spell; And the book it was wrote by Michael Scot, Who held in awe the fiends of hell. They buried it deep, where his bones they sleep, That mortal man might never it see: But Thomas did save it from the grave, When he returned from Faerie. The black spae-book from his breast he took, And turned the leaves with curious hand; No ropes, did he find, the wizzard could bind, But threefold ropes of sifted sand. They sifted the sand from the Nine-stane burn, And shaped the ropes so curiouslie; But the ropes would neither twist nor twine, For Thomas true and his gramarye. The black spae-book from his breast he took, And again he turned it with his hand; And he bade each lad of Tiviot add The barley chaff to the sifted sand. The barley chaff to the sifted sand They added still by handfuls nine; But Redcap sly, unseen was by, And the ropes would neither twist nor twine. And still beside the Nine-stane burn, Ribbed like the sand at mark of sea; The ropes that would not twist nor turn, Shaped of the sifted sand you see. The black spae-book true Thomas he took; Again its magic leaves he spread; And he found that to quell the powerful spell, The wizzard must be boiled in lead. On a circle of stones they placed the pot, On a circle of stones but barely nine; They heated it red and fiery hot, Till the burnished brass did glimmer and shine. They rolled him up in a sheet of lead, A sheet of lead for a funeral pall; They plunged him in the cauldron red, And melted him, lead, and bones, and all. At the Skelf-hill, the cauldron still The men of Liddesdale can shew; And on the spot where they boiled the pot, The spreat and the deer-hair ne'er shall grow. THE COUT OF KEELDAR. The eiry blood-hound howled by night, The streamers flaunted red, Till broken streaks of flaky light O'er Keeldar's mountains spread. The ladye sigh'd as Keeldar rose: —“Come tell me, dear love mine, Go you to hunt where Keeldar flows, Or on the banks of Tyne?”— —“The heath-bell blows where Keeldar flows, By Tyne the primrose pale; But now we ride on the Scotish side, To hunt in Liddesdale.”— —“Gin you will ride on the Scotish side, Sore must thy Margaret mourn; For Soulis abhorred is Lyddall's lord, And I fear you'll ne'er return. “The axe he bears, it hacks and tears; 'Tis formed of an earth-fast flint; No armour of knight, tho' ever so wight, Can bear its deadly dint. “No danger he fears, for a charmed sword he wears; Of adderstone the hilt; No Tynedale knight had ever such might, But his heart-blood was spilt.”— —“In my plume is seen the holly green, With the leaves of the rowan tree; And my casque of sand, by a mermaid's hand, Was formed beneath the sea. “Then, Margaret dear, have thou no fear; That bodes no ill to me; Though never a knight by mortal might Could match his gramarye.”— Then forward bound both horse and hound, And rattle o'er the vale; As the wintry breeze, through leafless trees, Drives on the pattering hail. Behind their course the English fells In deepening blue retire; Till soon before them boldly swells The muir of dun Redswire. And when they reached the Redswire high, Soft beam'd the rising sun; But formless shadows seemed to fly Along the muir-land dun. And when he reached the Redswire high, His bugle Keeldar blew; And round did float, with clamorous note And scream, the hoarse curlew. The next blast that young Keeldar blew, The wind grew deadly still; But the sleek fern, with fingery leaves, Waved wildly o'er the hill. The third blast that young Keeldar blew, Still stood the limber fern; And a wee man, of swarthy hue, Up started by a cairn. His russet weeds were brown as heath, That clothes the upland fell; And the hair of his head was frizzly red, As the purple heather bell. An urchin, clad in prickles red, Clung cowring to his arm; The hounds they howl'd, and backward fled, As struck by fairy charm. —“Why rises high the stag-hound's cry, Where stag-hound ne'er should be? Why wakes that horn the silent morn, Without the leave of me?”— —“Brown dwarf, that o'er the muir-land strays, Thy name to Keeldar tell.”— —“The Brown Man of the Muirs, who stays Beneath the heather bell. “'Tis sweet, beneath the heather bell, To live in autumn brown; And sweet to hear the lav'rocks swell, Far far from tower and town. “But woe betide the shrilling horn, The chase's surly cheer; And ever that hunter is forlorn, Whom first at morn I hear.”— Says—“Weal nor woe, nor friend nor foe, In thee we hope nor dread.”— —But, ere the bugles green could blow, The Wee Brown Man had fled. And onward, onward, hound and horse, Young Keeldar's band have gone; And soon they wheel, in rapid course, Around the Keeldar Stone. Green vervain round its base did creep, A powerful seed that bore; And oft, of yore, its channels deep Were stained with human gore. And still, when blood-drops, clotted thin, Hang the grey moss upon, The spirit murmurs from within, And shakes the rocking stone. Around, around, young Keeldar wound, And called in scornful tone, With him to pass the barrier ground, The spirit of the stone. The rude crag rocked;—“I come for death! I come to work thy woe!”— And 'twas the Brown Man of the Heath That murmured from below. But onward, onward, Keeldar past, Swift as the winter wind; When, hovering on the driving blast, The snow flakes fall behind. They passed the muir of berries blae, The stone cross on the lee; They reached the green, the bonny brae, Beneath the birchen tree. This is the bonny brae, the green, Yet sacred to the brave, Where still, of ancient size, is seen Gigantic Keeldar's grave. The lonely shepherd loves to mark The daisy springing fair; Where weeps the birch of silver bark, With long dishevelled hair. The grave is green, and round is spread The curling lady fern; That fatal day the mould was red, No moss was on the cairn. And next they passed the chapel there; The holy ground was by, Where many a stone is sculptured fair, To mark where warriors lie. And here, beside the mountain flood, A massy castle frown'd; Since first the Pictish race in blood The haunted pile did found. The restless stream its rocky base Assails with ceaseless din; And many a troubled spirit strays The dungeons dark within. Soon from the lofty tower there hied A knight across the vale; —“I greet your master well,” he cried, “From Soulis of Liddisdale. “He heard your bugle's echoing call, In his green garden bower; And bids you to his festive hall, Within his ancient tower.”— Young Keeldar called his hunter train; —“For doubtful cheer prepare; And, as you open force disdain, Of secret guile beware. “'Twas here for Mangerton's brave lord, A bloody feast was set; Who weetless, at the festal board, The bull's broad frontlet met. “Then ever, at uncourteous feast, Keep every man his brand; And, as you mid his friends are placed, Range on the better hand. “And if the bull's ill omened head Appear to grace the feast, Your whingers, with unerring speed, Plunge in each neighbour's breast.”— In Hermitage they sat at dine, In pomp and proud array; And oft they filled the blood-red wine, While merry minstrels play. And many a hunting song they sung, And song of game and glee; Then tuned to plaintive strains their tongue, “Of Scotland's luve and lee.” To wilder measures next they turn: “The Black Black Bull of Norroway;” Sudden the tapers cease to burn, The minstrels cease to play; Each hunter bold, of Keeldar's train, Sat an enchanted man; For cold as ice, through every vein, The freezing life-blood ran. Each rigid hand the whinger wrung, Each gazed with glaring eye; But Keeldar from the table sprung, Unharmed by gramarye. He burst the door; the roofs resound; With yells the castle rung; Before him, with a sudden bound, His favourite blood-hound sprung. Ere he could pass, the door was barr'd; And, grating harsh from under, With creaking jarring noise, was heard A sound like distant thunder. The iron clash, the grinding sound, Announce the dire sword-mill; The piteous howlings of the hound The dreadful dungeon fill. With breath drawn in, the murderous crew Stood listening to the yell; And greater still their wonder grew, As on their ear it fell. They listen'd for a human shriek, Amid the jarring sound; They only heard, in echoes weak, The murmurs of the hound. The death-bell rung, and wide were flung The castle gates amain; While hurry out the armed rout, And marshal on the plain. Ah! ne'er before in border feud, Was seen so dire a fray; Through glittering lances Keeldar hewed A red corse-paven way. His helmet, formed of mermaid sand, No lethal brand could dint; No other arms could e'er withstand The axe of earth-fast flint. In Keeldar's plume the holly green, And rowan leaves, nod on; And vain Lord Soulis' sword was seen, Though the hilt was adderstone. Then up the Wee Brown Man he rose, By Soulis of Liddisdale; —“In vain,” he said, “a thousand blows Assail the charmed mail. “In vain by land your arrows glide, In vain your faulchions gleam— —No spell can stay the living tide, Or charm the rushing stream.”— And now young Keeldar reached the stream, Above the foamy linn; The border lances round him gleam, And force the warrior in. The holly floated to the side, And the leaf of the rowan pale: Alas! no spell could charm the tide, Nor the lance of Liddisdale. Swift was the Cout o' Keeldar's course, Along the lily lee; But home came never hound nor horse, And never home came he. Where weeps the birch with branches green, Without the holy ground, Between two old grey stones is seen The warrior's ridgy mound. And the hunters bold, of Keeldar's train, Within yon castle's wall, In a deadly sleep must ay remain, Till the ruined towers down fall. Each in his hunter's garb array'd, Each holds his bugle horn; Their keen hounds at their feet are laid, That ne'er shall wake the morn. GLENFINLAS, OR LORD RONALD's CORONACH. “For them the viewless forms of air obey, “Their bidding heed, and at their beck repair: “They know what spirit brews the stormful day, “And heartless oft, like moody madness, stare “To see the phantom train their secret work prepare.” O hone a rie'! O hone a rie'! The pride of Albin's line is o'er, And fallen Glenartney's stateliest tree; We ne'er shall see Lord Ronald more! O, sprung from great Macgillianore, The chief that never feared a foe, How matchless was thy broad claymore, How deadly thine unerring bow! Well can the Saxon widows tell, How, on the Teith's resounding shore, The boldest Lowland warriors fell, As down from Lenny's pass you bore. But o'er his hills, on festal day, How blazed Lord Ronald's beltane tree; While youths and maids the light strathspey So nimbly danced with Highland glee. Cheer'd by the strength of Ronald's shell, E'en age forgot his tresses hoar; But now the loud lament we swell, O ne'er to see Lord Ronald more! From distant isles a chieftain came, The joys of Ronald's halls to find; And chase with him the dark brown game, That bounds o'er Albin's hills of wind. 'Twas Moy; whom in Columba's isle The seer's prophetic spirit found, As, with a minstrel's fire the while, He waked his harp's harmonious sound. Full many a spell to him was known, Which wandering spirits shrink to hear; And many a lay of potent tone, Was never meant for mortal ear. For there, 'tis said, in mystic mood, High converse with the dead they hold; And oft espy the fated shroud, That shall the future corpse enfold. O so it fell, that, on a day, To rouse the red deer from their den, The chiefs have ta'en their distant way, And scour'd the deep Glenfinlas glen. No vassals wait their sports to aid, To watch their safety, deck their board; Their simple dress, the Highland plaid, Their trusty guard, the Highland sword. Three summer days, through brake and dell, Their whistling shafts successful flew; And still, when dewy evening fell, The quarry to their hut they drew. In grey Glenfinlas' deepest nook The solitary cabin stood, Fast by Moneira's sullen brook, Which murmurs through that lonely wood. Soft fell the night, the sky was calm, When three successive days had flown; And summer mist, in dewy balm, Steep'd heathy bank, and mossy stone. The moon, half hid in silvery flakes, Afar her dubious radiance shed, Quivering on Katrine's distant lakes, And resting on Benledi's head. Now in their hut, in social guise, Their sylvan fare the chiefs enjoy; And pleasure laughs in Ronald's eyes, As many a pledge he quaffs to Moy. —“What lack we here to crown our bliss, While thus the pulse of joy beats high? What, but fair woman's yielding kiss, Her panting breath, and melting eye? “To chase the deer of yonder shades, This morning left their father's pile The fairest of our mountain maids, The daughters of the proud Glengyle. “Long have I sought sweet Mary's heart, And dropp'd the tear, and heav'd the sigh: But vain the lover's wily art, Beneath a sister's watchful eye. “But thou may'st teach that guardian fair, While far with Mary I am flown, Of other hearts to cease her care, And find it hard to guard her own. “Touch but thy harp, thou soon shalt see The lovely Flora of Glengyle, Unmindful of her charge and me, Hang on thy notes, 'twixt tear and smile. “Or, if she choose a melting tale, All underneath the greenwood bough, Will good St Oran's rule prevail, Stern huntsman of the rigid brow?”— —“Since Enrick's fight, since Morna's death, No more on me shall rapture rise; Responsive to the panting breath, Or yielding kiss, or melting eyes. “E'en then, when o'er the heath of woe, Where sunk my hopes of love and fame, I bade my harp's wild wailings flow, On me the seer's sad spirit came. “The last dread curse of angry heaven, With ghastly sights, and sounds of woe, To dash each glimpse of joy, was given— The gift, the future ill to know. “The bark thou saw'st, yon summer morn, So gaily part from Oban's bay, My eye beheld her dash'd and torn, Far on the rocky Colonsay. “Thy Fergus too—thy sister's son, Thou saw'st with pride the gallant's power, As, marching 'gainst the lord of Downe, He left the skirts of huge Benmore. “Thou only saw'st their tartans wave, As down Benvoirlich's side they wound: Heard'st but the pibroch, answering brave To many a target clanking round. “I heard the groans, I mark'd the tears, I saw the wound his bosom bore, When on the serried Saxon spears He pour'd his clan's resistless roar. “And thou, who bidst me think of bliss, And bidst my heart awake to glee, And court, like thee, the wanton kiss— That heart, O Ronald, bleeds for thee! “I see the death damps chill thy brow; I hear thy warning spirit cry; The corpse-lights dance—they're gone, and now....! No more is given to gifted eye!”— —“Alone enjoy thy dreary dreams, Sad prophet of the evil hour! Say, should we scorn joy's transient beams, Because to-morrow's storm may lour? “Or false, or sooth, thy words of woe, Clangillian's chieftain ne'er shall fear; His blood shall bound at rapture's glow, Though doom'd to stain the Saxon spear. “E'en now, to meet me in yon dell, My Mary's buskins brush the dew;”— He spoke, nor bade the chief farewell, But call'd his dogs, and gay withdrew. Within an hour return'd each hound; In rush'd the rouzers of the deer; They howl'd in melancholy sound, Then closely couch'd beside the seer. No Ronald yet; though midnight came, And sad were Moy's prophetic dreams, As, bending o'er the dying flame, He fed the watch-fire's quivering gleams. Sudden the hounds erect their ears, And sudden cease their moaning howl; Close press'd to Moy, they mark their fears By shivering limbs, and stifled growl. Untouch'd, the harp began to ring, As softly, slowly, oped the door; And shook responsive every string, As light a footstep press'd the floor. And by the watch-fire's glimmering light, Close by the minstrel's side was seen An huntress maid, in beauty bright, All dropping wet her robes of green. All dropping wet her garments seem; Chill'd was her cheek, her bosom bare, As, bending o'er the dying gleam, She wrung the moisture from her hair. With maiden blush she softly said, —“O gentle huntsman, hast thou seen, In deep Glenfinlas' moon-light glade, A lovely maid in vest of green: “With her a chief in Highland pride; His shoulders bear the hunter's bow, The mountain dirk adorns his side, Far on the wind his tartans flow?”— —“And who art thou? and who are they?” All ghastly gazing, Moy replied: “And why, beneath the moon's pale ray, Dare ye thus roam Glenfinlas' side?”— —“Where wild Loch Katrine pours her tide, Blue, dark, and deep, round many an isle, Our father's towers o'erhang her side, The castle of the bold Glengyle. “To chase the dun Glenfinlas deer, Our woodland course this morn we bore, And haply met, while wandering here, The son of great Macgillianore. “O aid me, then, to seek the pair, Whom loitering in the woods I lost; Alone, I dare not venture there, Where walks, they say, the shrieking ghost.”— —“Yes, many a shrieking ghost walks there; Then first, my own sad vow to keep, Here will I pour my midnight prayer, Which still must rise when mortals sleep.”— —“O first, for pity's gentle sake, Guide a lone wanderer on her way! For I must cross the haunted brake, And reach my father's towers ere day.”— —“First, three times tell each Ave-bead, And thrice a Pater-noster say; Then kiss with me the holy reed: So shall we safely wind our way.”— —“O shame to knighthood, strange and foul! Go, doff the bonnet from thy brow, And shroud thee in the monkish cowl, Which best befits thy sullen vow. “Not so, by high Dunlathmon's fire, Thy heart was froze to faith and joy, When gaily rung thy raptured lyre, To wanton Morna's melting eye.”— Wild stared the minstrel's eyes of flame, And high his sable locks arose, And quick his colour went and came, As fear and rage alternate rose. —“And thou! when by the blazing oak I lay, to her and love resign'd, Say, rode ye on the eddying smoke, Or sailed ye on the midnight wind! “Not thine a race of mortal blood, Nor old Glengyle's pretended line; Thy dame, the Lady of the Flood, Thy sire, the Monarch of the Mine.”— He mutter'd thrice St Oran's rhyme, And thrice St Fillan's powerful prayer; Then turn'd him to the eastern clime, And sternly shook his coal-black hair. And, bending o'er his harp, he flung His wildest witch-notes on the wind; And loud, and high, and strange, they rung, As many a magic change they find. Tall wax'd the spirit's altering form, Till to the roof her stature grew; Then, mingling with the rising storm, With one wild yell, away she flew. Rain beats, hail rattles, whirlwinds tear; The slender hut in fragments flew; But not a lock of Moy's loose hair Was waved by wind, or wet by dew. Wild mingling with the howling gale, Loud bursts of ghastly laughter rise; High o'er the minstrel's head they sail, And die amid the northern skies. The voice of thunder shook the wood, As ceased the more than mortal yell; And, spattering foul, a shower of blood Upon the hissing firebrands fell. Next, dropp'd from high a mangled arm; The fingers strain'd an half-drawn blade: And last, the life-blood streaming warm, Torn from the trunk, a gasping head. Oft o'er that head, in battling field, Stream'd the proud crest of high Benmore; That arm the broad claymore could wield, Which dyed the Teith with Saxon gore. Woe to Moneira's sullen rills! Woe to Glenfinlas' dreary glen! There never son of Albin's hills Shall draw the hunter's shaft agen! E'en the tired pilgrim's burning feet At noon shall shun that sheltering den, Lest, journeying in their rage, he meet The wayward Ladies of the Glen. And we—behind the chieftain's shield, No more shall we in safety dwell; None leads the people to the field— And we the loud lament must swell. O hone a rie'! O hone a rie'! The pride of Albin's line is o'er; And fallen Glenartney's stateliest tree;— We ne'er shall see Lord Ronald more! END OF VOLUME SECOND.</field>
