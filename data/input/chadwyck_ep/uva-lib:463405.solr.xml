      <field name="fulltext">To the right Honourable sir William Webbe Knight, Lord Maior of the famous Citie of London, Richard Iohnson, wisheth health, with increase of honour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Gentlemen Readers. The Waters were his Winding sheete, the Sea was made his Toome; Yet for his fame the Ocean Sea, was not sufficient roome. England his hart; his Corps the Waters haue; And that which rays'd his fame, became his grave. The nine worthies of London, explayning the honourable exercise of Armes, the vertues of the valiant, and the innumerable attemptes of Magnanimious mindes. Sir William Wallworth Fishmonger, sometime Maior of London. What I shall speake, suppose it is not vaine, Nor thinke Ambition tunes my sounding voyce; It bootes not clay to stand on glorious gayne, An other place bereaues vs of that choyce: For when the Pompe of earthlie pleasures gone, Our goasts lie buried vnderneath a stone. Nor when I liu'd carpt I at Phœbus light My deeds did passe without comparing pride, Who shone the least (mee thought apear'd more bright) I wisht it secret what the world discride, Nor would now shewe (fayre Goddesse but for thee,) The charge beseemes an other and not mee. To ouerpasse then how I was instaul'd To weare the purple robe of Maiestrate, It shall suffice I su'de not, but was calde, Of Fortunes gifts let baser minds relate: In such a time it was my chaunce to sway, When riches quaild, and Vertue wonne the day. In Richards Raygne the second of that name Of Londons weale Liefetenant to his Grace, Wallworth was chose vnworthie of the same Within his hand to beare the Cities mace: To Fishmongers the honour did redownd, Whose brotherhood was my preferments grownd. These were not dayes of peace but broyling warre, Dissention spred hir venom through the land, And stird the Prince and subiect to a iarre Hated loue, Rigor dutie did withstand: In such a tempest of vnbridled force, As manie lost their liues without remorse. For by a taxe the King requirde to haue, The men of Kent and Essex did rebell, Their first Decree concluded none to saue But hauocke all, a heauie tale to tell: And so when they were gatherde to a head, Towards London were these gracelesse Rebels ledd. What spoyle they made in Countries as they came, How they did rob and tyrranize in pride, The widowes cries were patterns of their shame, And sanguin streames of infants blood beside: For like the sea when it hath caught a breach, So rusht these Traytors, past compassions reach. So desperate was their rage as they preuailde, And entered the Citie by the sword, The towre wals were mightely assayld, And prisoner there made headlesse at a word: Earles manner houses were by them destroyd, The Sauoy and S. Iones, by Smithfield spoyld. All men of law that fell into their hands They left them breathlesse weltering in their blood, Ancient records were turn'd to firebrands, Anie had fauour sooner then the good: So stout these cutthrotes were in their degree, That Noblemen must serue them on their knee. In burning and in slaughter long they toyld, That made the King and all his traine agast, Such rancour had their stomackes ouerboyld They hopte to get the Soueraignitie at last: In deede his Maiestie was young in yeares, Which brought distresse to him and to his Peeres. Yet with a loyall guard of bils and Bowes Collected of our tallest men of trade, I did protect his person from his foes, Where there presumption trembled to inuade: It yerkt my soule to see my Prince abusde, In whose defence no danger I refusde. In these extreames it was no boote to fight, The Rebbels marched with so huge an host, The King crau'd Parley by a noble Knight Of sterne Wat Tiler ruler of the rost: A countrie Boore, a goodlie proper swayne, To put his Countrie to such wretched payne. This Rustick scoft at first the Kings request Yet at the last he seem'd to giue consent, Aleaging he would come when he thought best: T'is well (quoth he) is all their courage spent: Ile make them on their bended knees intreat, Or cast their bodies in a bloodie sweat. Begirt with steele, our gownes were laid apart, Age hindred not, though feeble were my ioynts. T'would make a fearefull coward take a heart When Prince opprest a Countries cause appoynts: Who would refuse, and death or grieuous paine To follow him that is his Soueraygne? The place appoynted where to meete these mates (That like audatious pessants did prepare, As if their calling did concerne high states, With brasen lookes deuoyd of awfull care) Was Smithfeeld, where his Maiesty did stay, An howre ere these Rebels found the way. At last the leaders of that brutish rowt Iacke Straw, Wat Tiler, and a number more, Aproacht the place with such a yelling showt, As seldome had the like been heard before: The King spake faire, and bad them lay downe armes, And he would pardon all their former harmes. But as fierce Lions are not tam'd with words, Nor sauage Monsters conquered but by force, So gentlenesse vnshethes a Traitors sword, And fayre perswasions makes the wicked worse: His clemencie prouoakt, and not dismaide, Because of them, they thought the King affraide. And as a witnesse of their inward vice Their tongues beganne to taunt in sawsie sort, Obedience blusht, and Honour lost her price, A modest shame forbids the fowle report: How Presumption made these Caitifes swell, As if the Diuels did bellowfoorth of Hell. Their loathsome talke inkindle angers fire And fretting passions made my sinewes shake, T'was death to me to see the Base aspire: Such woundes would men in deadlie slumber wake. Yet I refrainde, my betters were in place, It were no maners Nobles to disgrace. But when I saw the Rebels pride encrease, And none controll and counterchecke thier rage, T'were seruice good (thought I) to purchase peace, And malice of contentious brags asswage: With this conceyt all feare had taken flight, And I alone prest to the traitors sight. Their multitude could not amaze my minde, Their bloudie weapons did not make me shrinke, True valour hath his constancie assignde, The Eagle at the Sunne will neuer winke: Amongst their troupes incenst with mortall hate, I did arest Wat Tiler on the pate. The stroke was giuen with so good a will, It made the Rebell coutch vnto the earth, His fellowes that beheld (t'is strange) were still It mard the manor of their former mirth: I left him not, but ere I did depart, I stabd my dagger to his damned heart. The rest perceiuing of their captaine slaine, Soone terrified did cast their weapons downe, And like to sheepe began to flie amaine, They durst not looke on Iustice dreadfull frowne. The king pursude, and we were not the last, Till furie of the fight were ouerpast. Thus were the mangled parts of peace recurde; The Princes falling state by right defended; From common weale all mischiefe quite abiurde, With loue and dutie vertue was attended. And for that deed that day before t'was night, My king in guerdon dubbed me a knight. Nor ceast he so to honour that degree. A costly hat his highnesse likewise gaue, That Londons maintenance might euer be, A sword also he did ordaine to haue, That should be caried still before the Maior, Whose worth deserude succession to that chaire, This much in age when strength of youth was spent, Hath Walworth by vnwonted valour gaind, T'was all he sought, his countrey to content. Successe hath fortune for the iust ordaind, And when he died, this order he began, Lord Maiors are knights their office being done. Sir Henrie Pitchard Knight. The potter tempers not the massie golde, A meaner substance serues his simple trade, His workemanship consistes of slimie molde, Where any plaine impression soone is made: His Pitchards haue no outward glittering pompe, As other mettels of a finer stampe. Yet for your vse as wholsome as the rest, Though their beginning be but homely found, And sometime they are taken for the best, If that be precious that is alwayes sound. From gould corrupting poysons do infect, Where earthen cups are free from all suspect. So censure of the Pitchard you behould, Whose glorie springes not of his lowlie frame, Though he be clay he may compare with gould His properties nere felt reproachfull shame: For when I first drew breath vpon the earth, My mind did beawtifie creations byrth. I dare not sing of Mars his bloodie scarres, It is a stile too high for my conceipt, Yet in my youth I serued in the warres, And followde him that made his foes entreat: Edward the third the Phœnix of his time, For life and prowes spotted with no crime. From France returnd, so well I thriu'd at home, As by permission of celestiall grace, I rose by that men termd blind Fortunes dome To such a loftie dignitie of place: As by election then it did appeare, I was Lord Maior of London for a yeare. I vsde not my promotion with disdaine, Nor suffred heapes of coyne to fret with rust, I knew the ende of such a noble gaine, And saw that riches were not giuen for lust: But for reliefe and comfort of the poore, Against the straunger not to shut my doore. I could repeate perhaps some liberall deedes, But that I feare vaine-glories bitter checke, His plenties want, his haruest is but weedes, That doth in wordes his proper goodnesse decke: It shall suffice he hath them in recorde, That keepes in store his stewards iust reward. Yet for aduauncement of faire Londons fame, I will omit one principall regarde, That such as heare may imitate the same, When auarice by bountie shall be barde: Rich men should thinke of honour more then pelfe, I liu'd as well for others as my selfe. When Edward triumpht for his victories, And helde three crownes within his conquering hand, He brought rich Trophies from his enemies, That were erected in this happie land: We all reioyc'd and gaue our God the praise, That was the authour of those fortunate dayes. And as from Douer with the prince his sonne, The King of Cypres, France, and Scots did passe, All captiue prisoners to this mightie one, Fiue thousand men, and I the leader was, All well preparde, as to defend a fort, Went foorth to welcome him in martiall sort. The riches of our armour, and the cost, Each one bestowd in honour of that day, Were here to be exprest but labour lost, Silke coates and chaines of golde bare little sway: And thus we marcht accepted of our King, To whom our comming seemd a gracious thing. But when the Citie pearde within our sights, I crau'd a boune submisse vpon my knee, To haue his Grace, those Kings, with Earles and knights, A day or two to banquet it with me: The king admirde, yet thankefully replide, Vnto thy house both I and these will ride. Glad was I that so I did preuaile, My heart reuiud, my parts (me thought) were young, For cheare and sumptuous cost no coine did faile, And he that talkt of sparing did me wrong: Thus at my proper charge I did retaine Foure kings, one prince, and all their royall traine. Yet lo this pompe did vanish in an houre, There is no trusting to a broken staffe, Mans carefull life doth wither like a flower, The destenies do stroy what we do graffe: For all his might, my gold wherewith I pleasde, Death tooke vs both and would not be appeasde. Of all there now remaines no more but this, What vertue got by toyling labours paine, To shrine our spotlesse soules in heauenlie blisse, Till to our bodies they returne againe. What else we find is vaine and worthlesse drosse, And greatest getting but the greatest losse. Sir William Seuenoake. My harmelesse byrth misfortune quite contemd, And from my pappe did make my youth a pray, So scarcely budd, my branches were vnstemd; My byrth howre was Deathes blacke and gloomie day: Had not the highest stretched forth his might The breake of day had beene the darkest night. Some Monster that did euie Natures worke (When I was borne in Kent) did cast me foorth In desert wildes, where though no Beast did lurke To spoyle that life, the Heauens made for woorth: Vnder seauen Oakes yet mischiefe flung me downe, Where I was found and brougha vnto a towne. Behold an ebbe that neuer thought to flowe; Behold a fall vnlikelie to recouer; Behold a shrub, a weed, that grew full lowe; Behold a wren that neuer thought to houer: Behould yet how the highest can commaund, And make a sand foundation firmelie stand. For when my infants time induste more yeares After some education in the schoole, And some discretion in my selfe appeares With labor to be taught with manuall toole: To learne to liue, to London thus being found, Apprentise to a Groser I was bound. To please the honest care my master tooke, I did refuse no toyle nor drudging payne, My handes no labor euer yet forsooke Whereby I might encrease my masters gayne: Thus Seuenoake liud (for so they cald my name,) Till Heauen did place mee in a better frame. In time my prentise yeares were quite expirde, And then Bellona in my homelie brest, My Countries honour with her flames had firde, And for a Souldior made my fortune prest: Henry the fift my King did warre with France, Then I with him his right to readuance. There did couragious men with loue compare And striue by armes to get their Prince renowne, There sillie I like thirstie soule did fare To drinke their fill, would venter for to drowne: Then did the height of my inhaunst desire, Graunt me a little leasure to aspire. The Dolphyne then of Fraunce a comelie Knight, Disguised, came by chaunce into a place, Where I well wearied with the heate of fight, Had layd me downe (for warre had ceast his chace) And with reproachfull words, as layzie swaine, He did salute me ere I long had layne. I knowing that he was mine enemie A bragging French-man (for we tearmd them so, Ill brookt the proud disgrace he gaue to me, And therefore lent the Dolphyne such a blow: As warmd his courage well to lay about, Till he was breathlesse (though he were so stout.) At last the noble Prince did aske my name, My birth, my calling, and my fortunes past, With admiration he did heare the same, And so a bagge of crownes to me he cast: And when he went away he saide to mee, Seauenoake be prowd the Dolphyn fought with thee. When English had obtainde the victorie, We crossed backe the grudging seas againe, Where all my friends supposed warre to be For vice and follie, virtues onelie bane: But see the simple how they are deceaude, To iudge that honour, Honour hath bereaud. For when my Souldiors fame was laid aside, To be a Grocer once againe I framde, And he which rules aboue my steps did guide, That through his wealth Seuenoake in time was famde To be Lord Maior of London by degree, Where iustice made me sway with equitie. Gray haires made period vnto honours call, And frostie death had furrowed in my face, Colde Winter gashes, and to Sommers fall, And fainting nature left my mortall place: For with the date of flesh my life decayde, And Seuenoake dide: (for euery flower must fade.) By Testament in Kent I built a towne, And briefly calde it Seuenoake from my name, A free schoole to sweete learning, to renowne I placde for those that playde at honours game: Both land and liuing to that towne I gaue, Before I tooke possession of my graue. Thither I bare my flesh, but leane my fame, To be a president for London wights, And you that now beholde faire Vertues maime, Thinke he is happie for his Countrey fights, For, for my guerdon to this pleasant field, My carkas did my dying spirit yeeld. [Where Fortune had her birth the Sunne sate downe] Where Fortune had her birth the Sunne sate downe, Yet gaue no liuing glorie to the childe, She grew and gaue the God a golden crowne, It pleased him not, for he was euer milde: Yet drew she disposition from his throne, That without her no wight can moue alone. Sir Thomas White. Whyte is my name, and milke white are my haires, White were my deedes, though vaine is proper praise, White for my countrie were my kind affayres, White was the rule that measurd all my dayes: Yet blacke the mould that coutcht me in my graue, By which more pure my present state I haue. I cannot sing of armes and blood-red warres, Nor was my colour mixt with Mars his hew: I honour those that ended Countrey iarres, For therein subiects shew that they are trew. But priuately at home I shewde my selfe, To be no louer of vaine worldly pelfe. My deedes haue tongues to speake though I surcease, My Orator the learned striue to bee, Because I twined paulmes in time of peace, And gaue such gifts that made faire learning free: My care did build them bowers of sweete content, Where many wise their golden time haue spent. A noyse of gratefull thankes within mine eares, Descending from their studies (glads my heart) That I began to wish with priuate teares, There liued more that were of Whites desert: But now I looke and spie that time is balde, And Vertue comes not, being seldome calde. But sith I am awaked not to waile, But to vnfolde to Fame my former life. I must on forward with my single tale, For sorrow will but breake the heart with strife, White is no warriour (as I sayd before,) Nor entred euer into daungers doore. The English Cities and incorporate townes, Doe beare me witnesse of my Countreys care, Where yearely I doe feede the poore with crownes, For I was neuer niggard yet to spare, And all chiefe Burrowes of this blessed land, Haue somewhat tasted of my liberall hand. He that did lend to me the grace of wealth, Did not bestow it for to choake with store, But to maintaine the needie poore in health, By which expence my wealth encreased more, The oyle of gladnesse euer chear'd my hart, Why should I not then pitie others smart. Lord Maior of London I was cal'd to bee, And Iustice ballance bare with vpright hand: I iudg'd all causes right in each degree, I neuer partiall in the law did stand: But as my name was White so did I striue, To make my deedes whilest yet I was aliue. But my prefixed fate had twinde my thread, And White it was, and therefore best she likt it, She set her web within a loome of lead, And with her baulme of grace she sweetly dight it: And with consent her sisters gaue this grace, That White should keepe his colour in this place. Sir Iohn Bonham knight. Let them that pull their quils from Griffons wings, And dippe them in the bloud of Pagans bane, Let them describe me from the brest that sings, A Poem of bloudie showers of raigne: And in my tale a mournefull Eleagie, To such as do the lawes of God denie. A gentleman I am of gentle blood, A Knight my Father was, yet thought no scorne To place his sonne within a prentise hood, For nature will appeare as she was borne: A Deuonshire man to London loe I came, To learne to traffique of a Marchant man. Shortelie from thence to Denmarke was I bound, Well shipt with ware my master gaue in charge, I deemd the water better then the ground, And on the seas a man might see at large: Me thought that Fortune there might flie her fill, And pitch and light vpon what place she will. Ariud at last, in Denmarke was I sett, Where Bonham did demeane himselfe so well, That though some strangers there had pitcht a nett To catch my feete, themselues therein soone fell: And such dishonour dropt vpon their head, As they their natiue Countrie quicklie fled. My worthlesse Fame vnto the King was brought, Who shewd himselfe both mild and debonare, A cause of gracious kindnes still he sought, And for my Countrey did commend my care: And though I say it, that might better cease, Bonham did purchase fame, and loues encrease. A vertuous Ladie, and a curteous prince, This famous king vnto his daughter had, Hir countenance did the baser sort conuince, Yet did she bare her gently to bad: Such was her beautie, such was her grace and fauour, That watchfull Enuy no way could depraue her. Excepting still the praise of Proserpine, I may a little glance vpon her grace, The words shee spake did euer seeme diuine, And Nature chose her alters in her face: Where in the day her golden flames do burne, And they that gaze shall frie except they turne. There bodies once consum'd, loue tooke their soules, And there satte binding them within her haire, She neede not frowne, her smoothest lookes controles, See how shee slayes, yet dooth the guiltlesse spare: Guiltlesse they are that dare not stay so long, To heare the musick of inchaunting song. Should I but speake the words vnto her face, Perhaps you would suppose I flatter her, If so I haue too long vpheld the chace, And negligentlie spard the pricking spurre: In whose sweete praise I end not yet begunne, Because my lame conceipt wants feete to runne. Who will not iudge the brauest Denmarke Knights, Will cracke their Lances in her proud defence, And now by this a troope of worthie wights Prepared Iustes, her beawtie to incence: And vnto me vnworthie me she gaue, A fauour to adorne my courage braue. I know your ielouslie will iudge me nowe, And say I prais'd her for her fauours sake, Alas he lookes not vp, is bound to bowe, A Ceader neuer springeth from a Brake: It pleasd her well, age not displeased mee, Why then should Enuie still with Honour bee. They that haue guiders cannot chuse but runne, Their Mistresse eyes doe learne them Chiualrie, With those commaunds these Turneys are begunne, And shiuerd Launces in the ayre do flie: No more but this, there Bonham had the best, Yet list I not to vaunt how I was blest. Each Knight had fauour bound to his desart, And euerie Ladie lent her loue a smile, There boldly did I not my selfe insert, Nor secret practise did my pride compile: But of her selfe the gentle Princesse gaue Rewarde of Honour vnto me her slaue. In fine my Masters shippe with goods were fraught, And I desirous to returne agayne, For all the fauours that my Fortune wrought, Vnto my Masters businesse was no mayne: But so occasion trusty friend to time, Prepard me steps, and made mee way to clime. Great Solimon the Turkish Emperor, Made sodaine warres against the Danish King, And most vnlike a noble Emperour Did spoyle and ruine to his confines bring: A thing vnlike, yet truth to witnesse call, And you shall finde hee made mee Generall. A puissant armie then was leuied straight, And skilfull pilats sent to guide my ship, Imagin but a Christians deadly hate, Against the heathen that our blood doth sip: Then thinke how Bonham bent against the Turke, Wrought wonders by the high almighties worke. Halfe of his armie smouldred with the dust, Lay slaughtred on the earth in gorie blood, And he himselfe compeld to quell his lust, By composition for his peoples good: Then at a parlie he admirde me so, He made me knight, and let his armie go. He gaue me costly robes, and chaines of golde, And garded with his Gallies sent me backe: For Fame vnto the Danish King had tolde, My gotten glorie, and the Turkish wracke: He gaue me gifts in guerdon of my fight, And sent me into England like a knight. How I was welcomd there t'were vaine to tell, For shortly after life had runne his race, And hither was I summoned to dwell, My other fellow Worthies to embrace: Thus gently borne, a Marchant by my trade, And in the field Bonham a knight was made. Sir Christopher Croker knight of London Vintner. It is not birth that makes a man renownde, Nor treasures store that purchaseth our fame, Bigge words are but an emptie vessels sound, And death is better then a life with shame. This proueth Croker in his trauailes made, Of London once a Vintner by his trade. In Gracious-streete there was I bound to serue, My masters name hight Stodie in his time, From whom in dutie I did neuer swarue, Nor was corrupted with detested crime: My education taught me so to liue, As by my paines my maisters purse might thriue. My fellow seruants lou'd me with their hearts; My friends reioyc'd to see me prosper so, And kind Doll Stodie (though for small deserts) On me vouchsaft affection to bestow: Whose constancie was such that for her sake, No toyle was grieuous I did vndertake. Such was my state as I my selfe could wish, Deuoid of care, not toucht with egre want, My sleepe secure, my foode choise bewties dish, Onely in this my pleasure seemed scant, That I vnable was her state to raise, That was the lengthner of my happie dayes. Whilst thus I was perplexed with that thought; Behold how Fortune fauourde my desire, Of sodaine warres the ioyfull newes was brought, And Edward ayde of Souldiors did require, Amongst the rest it fell vnto my chaunce, That I was prest to follow him to Fraunce. My master would haue sewd for my discharge, His daughter with her teares gan me assaile, On euery side they prayd and promist large, But nothing could in that respect preuaile: Such thirst of honour spurd my courage on, I would to warres although I went alone. My forwardnesse perceyu'd, my valour knowne, Ouer a band of Souldiors I was chiefe, Then sproute the seedes that were but lately sowne, My longing soule had quickly found reliefe: I sparde no cost, nor shrunke for any paine, Because I ment my Loue should reape the gaine. To proue my faith vnto my Countries stay, And that a prentice (though but small esteemd,) Vnto the stoutest neuer giueth way, If credite may by triall be redeemd: At Burdeaux siege when other came too late, I was the first made entrance through the gate. And when Don Peter driuen out of Spaine, By an vsurping Bastard of his line, He crau'd some helpe his crowne to reobtaine, That in his former glorie he might shine: Our king ten thousand seuerd from his host, My selfe was one, I speake it not in boast. With these Don Peter put the Bastard downe, Each Citie yeelded at our first approch, It was not long ere he had got the crowne, And taught his wicked brother to encroch: In these affaires so well I shewd my might, That for my labour I was made a knight. Thus labour neuer looseth his reward, And he that seekes for honour sure shall speed, What crauen mind was euer in regard? Or where consisteth manhood but in deed? I speake it that confirmd it by my life, And in the end Doll Stodie was my wife. Sir Iohn Haukwood knight. Who knowes my ofspring, doth not know my prime, Who knowes my birth, perhaps will scorne my deedes, My valour makes my vertue more then slime, For that suruiues though I weare deaths pale weedes: Ground doth consume the carkas vnto dust, Yet cannot make the valiants armour rust. After that eighteene yeares had toucht my head. Being a Printice boy in Lumbard streete, A Taylor by my trade, and I had lead A few wilde yeares for striplings farre vnmeete: A Souldior I was prest to serue in Fraunce, The Prince of Wales mine honour to inhaunce. I serude as priuate souldiour for awhile, Till courage made me greedie of renowne, And causde me giue a noble man the foile, That though with sturdie Launce did beare me downe, On foot that day my selfe did keepe in chace, Some worthie knights that feard to shew their face. That day the Prince of Wales surnamde the blacke, Did mount me on a gallant English steed. Where I bestirde me so vpon his backe, That none incountred me that did not bleed, It was not I, nor Fortune, nor my fate, His hand it was that seldome helpes to late. His be the honour then, and his the prayse, Yet haue I leaue to speake what Haukwood did, When noble Edward had disperst the rayes, And by his prowes of the French was rid. Three more then I (my selfe did make the fourth) The gentle Princes then dub'd knights of worth. His knights he tearmd vs still amongst the rest, And gaue vs honour fitting our estate, For England to be bound it seemd him best, Because the French had swallowed Edwards baite: I tooke my leaue, and begged on my knee, That I might wander other parts to see. The Prince inkindled with my honours heate; Discharging me, bestowde on me a chaine, For still fresh courage on my heart did beate, Which made me loue, and womens acts refraine: Hearing the Duke of Millaine was distrest, To Italie my voyage then was prest. The Seas I quickly past, and came to shore, With me were fifteene hundred English men, We marcht to Millaine walles, where we had more Of other nations to conioyne with them. There did the Italians tearme me Iohn Acute, Because I had their foes in such pursute. Castels and towers I had for my reward, And got enough to pay my men withall: But I to hired pay had no regarde, That prickt me on which climbs the highest wall, Honour and Fame, whereof they gaue me store, Which made me more audacious then before. Millaine thus peac'd, the Pope oppressed Spaine, Then thither was I sent to quell his pride: Which being done I did returne againe, And stoopt with age, in Padua Palace dide: And he that yet will heare of Iohn Acute, In Millaine shall not find the people mute. All warres you see do ende as well as peace, And then remaineth but a tumbe of dust, A voyce of Fame, a blacke and mourning hearce, To what then may we like this worldly lust: It is an euill vapouring smoke that fumes, Breaths in the braine, and so the life consumes. Sir Hugh Caluerey knight. Who feares to swim a riuer dreads the sea, But he that's best resolu'd dare venture both, The greatest lumpe doth not the greatest die, Base mettals to compare with golde are loth: And why my quiet wit refraines to speake, Is this because the tallest ship may leake. In England late yong Cauerley did liue, Silke-weauers honour merited by deedes, In forraine broyles continually I striue Of lasting memorie to sow the seedes: As by experience they in Poland may Expresse my English valour euery way. After my Princes seruice done in France, I was entreated to the Polish King, Where as the Frizeland horse doth breake the launce, And tamelesse beasts a valiant race doth bring: There Maximilian hunted with his Lords, Entangling mankind Beares in toyling cords. There did I bring a Boare vnto the bay, That spoyld the pleasant fields of Polonie, And ere the morning parted with her gray The foming beast as dead as clay did lie: The Ladies cheekes lookt red with chearefull blood, And I was much commended for that good. Some sayd I looked like Olympian Ioue, When as he crackt in two the Centaurs bow, As swiftly footed as the God of Loue, Or greene Syluanus when he chast the Roe: They brought me crownes of Lawrell wreathd with gold, The sweet and daintiest tongues my prayses told. These fauours fronted me with courage frowne, That like the yong Alcides I did looke, When he did lay the greedie Lion downe. No beast appeard when I the woodes forsooke, So that the King supposd I was some wight, Ordaind by heauen to expell their flight. In scarlet and in purple was I clad, And golden buskins put vpon my feete, A casket of the richest pearles I had, And euery Noble gently did me greete. So with the King I rode vnto the court, Where for to see me many did resort. At Iustes I euer was the formost man, In field still forward, Fame can witnesse it, And Cauerley at tilt yet neuer ran, But foming Steed so champed on the bit: But still my horse his masters valour shewd, When through my Beavir I with heat had blood. Yet men of armes, of wit, and greatest skill, Must die at last when deaths pale sisters please, But then for honour Fame remaineth still, When dead delights in graue shall find their ease: Ye long to know the truth in Fraunce I dide, When from the valiant Polands I did ride. Now honour let me lay me downe againe, And on thy pillow rest my wearie head, My passed prayse commaunds my soule remaine, Wheerin these rosie bowers, with sweet dew fed: Though I was valiant, yet my guiltlesse blood, In crueltie of warre I neuer stood. Henry Maleueret Grocer, surnamed Henrie of Cornhill. A precious cause hath still a rare effect, And deedes are greatest when the daungers most, It is no care that trauels dooth neglect, Nor loue that hath respect to idle cost: A Bramble neuer bringeth forth a Rose, Where fields are fruitfull there the Lillie growes. By this coniecture what may be the end, Of his defensiue force that fought for Christ, It is no common matter if we spend Both life and goods in quarrell of the hiest: The least desert dooth merit his reward, And best employde should haue not worst regard. No vaine presumption followes my deuise, For of my actions t'is in vaine to boast, Yet with the Pagans I encountred twise, To winne againe faire Sion that was lost: Vnto which warre I was not forst to go, T'was honours fire that did incense me so. For when the Iewes opprest with heathens pride, Of Christian princes craude some friendly ayd, In euery Countrey they were flat denide Saue that in England here their sute preuailde: Such was the farie of intestine strife, All Europe sought to spoyle each others life. And as in London there was order tane To make prouision for the holy land, My youthfull mind that fearde no forraine bane, Was so admirde by might of conquering hand: As for a single combate they did see, Th'ambassadours made speciall choyse of mee. Then for the Tankerd I did vse to beare And other things belonging to mine art, Mine hand did weeld Bellonas warlike speare, For I was armde in steele to play my part: A long we went to beard our daring foes, That soone were queld with terrour of our blowes. I neuer left the field, nor slept secure, Vntill I sawe Hierusalem regainde, To watch and labour I did still endure, What ist that diligence hath not obtainde? Yet grudging enuie valour to deface By treasons malice brought me indisgrace. The good that I had done was cleane forgot, Ingratitude preuailde agaynst my life, And nothing then but exile was my lot, Or else abide the stroke of fatall knife: For so the ruler of the Iewes concluded, His Grace by false reports was much deluded. There was no striuing in a forraine soyle, I tooke it patient though t'were causelesse done, And to auoyde the staine of such a foyle, That slaunderous tongues had wickedly begunne, Where to the holy well of Iacobs name, I found a caue to shroude me from their blame. And though my bodie were within their power, Yet was my minde vntouched of their hate. The valiant faint not, though that fortune lower, Nor are they fearefull at controlling fate: For in that water none could quench their thirst, Except he ment to combate with me first. By that occasion for my pleasures sake, I gaue both Knights and Princes heauie strokes, The proudest did presume a draught to take Was sure to haue his passeport seald with knocks: Thus liu'd I till my innocence was knowne, And then returnde, the king was pensiue growne. And for the wrong which he had offerd me, He vowde me greater friendship than before, My false accusers lost their libertie, And next their liues, I could not chalenge more: And thus with loue, with honour, and with fame, I did returne to London whence I came.
