      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MEMORY OF HIS DEARE BROTHER, Mr. Tho: Randolph. In such a solemn train of friends that sing Thy Dirge in pious lines, and sadly bring Religious Anthems to attend thy Hearse, Striving t'embalme thy name in precious verse: I, that should most, have no more power to raise Trophies to thee, or bring one grain of praise To crown thy Altar, then the Orbs dispense Motion without their sole Intelligence For I confesse that power which works in me Is but a weak resultance took from thee; And if some scatter'd seeds of heat divine Flame in my breast, they are deriv'd from thine: And these low sickly numbers must be such, As when steel moves, the Loadstone gives the touch: So like a spungy cloud that sucks up rain From the fat soil to send it back again, There may be now from me some language showne To urge thy merit, but 'twas first thy own: For though the Doners influence be past For new effects, the old impressions last; As in a bleeding trunk we oft discry Leaps in the head, and rowling in the eye, By vertue of some spirits, that alone Do tune those Organs, though the soul be gone. But siuce I adde unto this generall noise Onely weak sounds, and Eccho's of thy voice, Be this a taske for deeper mouthes, while I That cannot bribe the Phansy, thaw the eye: And on that Grave where they advance thy praise Do plant a sprigge of Cypresse, not of Baies. Yet flow these tears not that thy Reliques sit Fix't to their cell a constant Anchor it: Nor am I stirr'd that thy pale ashes have Ore the dark Climete of a private Grave No fair inscription: such distempers flow From poor lay-thoughts, whose blindnesse cannot know That to discerning Spirits the Grave can be But a large womb to immortallity: And a fair vertuous name can stand alone Brasse to the Tomb, and marble to the stone. No, 'tis that Ghostly progeny we mourne, Which carelesse you let fall into the Vrne: We had not flow'd with such a lauish tide Of tears and grief had not those Orphans dy'd. For what had been my losse, who reading thine, A Brother might have kiss'd in every line? These that are left, Posterity must have; VVhom a strict care hath reseu'd from the Grave To gather strength by Vnion; as the beams Of the bright Sun shot forth in severall streams, And thinly scatter'd, with lesse favour passe, Which cause aflame, contracted in a Glasse. These if they cannot much aduance thy fame, May stand dumb statues to preserve thy name: And like Sun-dialls to a day that's gone, Though poore in use, can tell there was a Sun. Yet if a fair confession plant no Bayes, Nor modest truth conceiv'd a lavish praise) I could to thy great glory tell this age Not one invenom'd line doth swell the page. VVith guilty legends; but so clear from all That shoot malicious noise, and vomit gall, That 'tis observ'd in every leafe of thine, Thou hast not scatter'd Snakes in any line. Here are no remnants tortur'd into rime, To gull the reeling judgements of the tuine. Nor any stale revesions patch thy writ, Glean'd from the reggs and frippery of wit. Each silable doth here as truely runne, Thine, as the light is proper to the Sunne. Nay in those feebler lines which thy last breath And labouring braines snatcht from the skirts of death, Though not so strongly pure, we may discry, The father in his last posterity, As clearly showne, as Virgins looks do passe Through a thinne Lawne, or shadows in the glasse: And in thy setting, as the suns, confesse. The fame large brightnesse, though the heat be lesse. Such native sweetnesse flowes in every line, The Reader cannot choose but sweare 'tis thine. Though I can tell, a rugged sect there is, Of some fly-wits will judge a squint on this; And from the easy flux of language guesse The fancies weak, because the noise is lesse; As if that Channel which doth smoothly glide With even streams, flow'd with a shallow tide. But let a quick discerning judgement look, And with a piercing eye untwist thy book In every loome, I know the second view Shall find more lustre then the first could do. For have you seen when gazing on the skies VVith strict survey, a new succession rise Of severall starrs, which do not so appear To every formall glance that shoots up there: So when the serious eye has firmly been Fix'd on the page, such large increase is seen Of various fancy, that each severall view, Makes the same fruitfull book a Mart of new. But I forbear this mention; since I must Ransack thy ashes, and revile thy dust With such low Characters, I mean to raise Thee to my contemplation, not my praise: And they that wish thy picture clearly showne In a true glasse, I wish would use thy own: VVhere I presume how ere thy vertues come Ill shap'd abroad, th'art fairly drest at home. RO. RANDOLPH, M.A. student of C. Church. [Blest Spirit, when I first did see] Blest Spirit, when I first did see The Genius of thy Poetrie, Nimble and fluent; in a strain Even with, if not beyond the brain Of Laureats that cround the stage. And liv'd the wonders of the age: And this but sparkles from a fire That flam'd up, and soar'd much higher, I gaz'd desirous to see VVhither thy wit would carry thee. Thy first rise was so high, that even As needs it must, the next was heaven. I. T. A. M. Vpon Mr. Randolph's Poems. Collected and published after his death. As when a swelling Cloud melted to showers, Sweetly deffuses fresh and active powers Into the shrunk and thirsty veines of earth; Blessing her barren womb with a new birth Of grain and fruit, and so redeems a land Of desperate people, from the destroying hand Of merc'lesse Plague, Famine or Death, and then Collects his streams into an Ocean: So thy deffusive soul, and fluent parts, (Great miracle of naturall wit, and Arts) Rapt up some Regions, bove our Sphear, did flow And shower their blessings down on us below: Whilst we dul earth, in extasies did sit Almost o'rewhelmed with thy flouds of wit. What bloud or verse, is pomp't from our dry brains Sprung like a tushing Torrent from thy Veines. When a long drought presag'd some fatall Dearth, Thy unexhausted Founts gave us new birth, Of wit and verse; when Cham or Isis fell, Thy opn'd floud gates made their Riv'lets swell Bove their proud Bancks: where planted by thy hand Th'resperian Orchards, Paphian Myrtles stand, And those sweete shades, where Lovers tell their blisses To th' whisp'ring leaves, and summe'em up in kisses. There in full Quire the Muses us'd to singe Melodious Odeshatching in Cham, their Spring. And all the Graces TOM, dwelt with thee too Crowning thy Front for old Citherons Brow. Nor were we rich alone, Climes far from hence Acknowledge you thy soveraigne influence: Sicillivis owe to thee their fruitfull Vale, And Cotswold Hill thy dewes created Dale All Lands and soyles from hence were fruitfull grown, And multipli'd the measures thou hast sown. Green-sword-untiled milk maids wish no blisses Beyond a stammell Petticoat, and kisses, And thy sweet Dowry: this alone, they cry, Will make our Beasts and milk to multiply. And the dull Fallow Clowns, who never thought Of God or Heaven, but in a floud or drought, Do gape and pray for Crops of Wit, and vow To make their Lads and Wenches, Poets now. For they can make their fields to laugh and sing To th' Muses Pipe, and Winter rihme to 'spring- They pray for the first curse; like Schollers now, To earn their livings by their sweaty Brow. Then the find Gardens of the Court are set With Flowers sprung from thy Muses Coronet. Those pretty Imps in Plush that on trust go For their fine clothes, and their fined Iudgements too, The frontispeece or Title page of Playes, Whose whole discourse is—As the Poet sayes. That Tauerns drain, (for Ivie is the sign Of all such sack-shop wits, as well as wine.) And make their verses dance on either hand With numerous feet, whilst they want feet to stand That score up jests for every glasse or cup, And the totall summe behinde the door cast up; These had been all dri'd up, and many more, That quaft up Helicon upon thy score. The sneaking Tribe, that drink and write by fits, As they can steale or borrow coyn or wits. That Panders fee for Plots, and then bely The paper with-An excelent Comedy, Acted (more was the pity) by th'Red Bull With great aplause, of some vain City-Gull: That damn Philosophy, and prove the curse Of emptinesse, both in the brain and Purse, These that scrape legs and trenchers to my Lord, Had starv'd, but for some scraps pickt from thy board. They had tri'd the Balladiers of Fidlers trade, Or a new Comedy at Tiburn made. Thus TOM thy pregnant Phancy crown'd us all With wealthy showers or minds Poeticall Nor did thy dewes distill in a cold raine But with a flash of Lightening op't thy braine. Which thaw'd our stupid spirits with lively heat, And from our frosts forc'd a Poetick sweat And now wits Common-wealth by thee repriv'd For its consumption shewes it not long liv'd, Thy far dispersed Streames divert their course Though some are damned up (toth' Muse Scourse This Ocean:—He that will fadome it By's Lines, shall sound an Ocean of wit. Not shallow, low, and troubled, but profound And vest, though in these narrow limits bound The tribute of our eyes or pens, all we can pay, Are some poor drops to thy Pactolus Sea. And first stoln thence, though now so muddy grown With our foul channels, they scarce seem thy own. Thus have I seen a peece of Coyn, which bore The Image of my King or Prince before, New cast into some Pesant, lose its grace; Yet's the same body with a fouler face. If our own store must pay; that gold which was Lent us in sterling, we must turn in brasse. Had'st thou write lesse or worse, then we might lay Some thing upon thy Vrn thou didst not say: But thou hast Phansies vast Monopolie, Our flock will scarce amount t'an Elegie, Yet all the Legacies thy fatall day Bequeath'd, thy sad Executor will pay. To late Divines (by will and Testament) A pæraphrase on each Commandement, In Morall Precepts, with a Disputacion Ending the Quarrells 'bout Predestination. To those that study how to spend the day, And yet grow wise—The Ethicks in a play, To Poets, 'cause there is no greater curse, Thou bequeathdst nothing, in thy empty purss, To City—Madams, that bespeak new faces For every Ploy or Feast, Thy Looking-glasses, And to their Chamber maids who only can Adorn their Ladies head: and dream of man. Th'ast left a Dowry; they tell now by stelth Writ only members of the Common-wealth. To Heaven thy Ravish't soul, (though who shall look, Will say it lives, in each line of thy Book) Thy Dust, unnaturall Reliques that could die, To earth; thy Fame, into eternitie. A Husband to thy VViddow'd Poetry, Not from the Court, but Vniversity. To thy sad Aunt, and now disparing mother, Thy little Orphans, and thy younger Brother; From all of which this free Confessions fit The younger Sister had the elder wit. [What need thy Book crave any other fame] What need thy Book crave any other fame, It is enough that it bears Randolphs name. VVho sees the title, and him understood Must much condemne himself, or say tis good. Go forth example to the Neophyte, VVho hence should learn to catechise his wit, And dresse his Phansy by this Glasse: whose Muse Wel favour'd is: should here her face peruse, It will not flatter, 'twill reflect the grace She takes from th'owner of a beautious face: But if a menstrous, and illiterate eye Blast her, the various specks shall soon descry The foul beholder, and proclaim her spoil Not to result from thence, but his own foil, ED. GAYTON. A. M. Ion [Immortall Ben is dead; and as that ball] Immortall Ben is dead; and as that ball On Ida toss'd, so is his Crown by all The infantry of wit. Vain Priests! that chair Is only fit for his trve Son and Heir. Reach here the Laurell. Randolph, 'tis thy praise Thy naked Scull shall well become the Bayes. See, Daphne, coures thy Ghost: and spite of fate, Thy Poems shall be Poet Laureat, G. W. Ioan. To his very worthy friend M. ROB. RANDOLPH of Chr, Ch. on the publishing of his Brothers Poems. We thank you worthy Sir, that tis our hap To praise even Randolph now without a clap, And give our sufferage yet, though not our voice, To shew the ods betwixt his fame and noyse: VVhose onely modesty we could applaud, That seldome durst presume to blush abroad; And bear his vast report, and setting forth His vertues, grow a suff'rer of his worth, Was scarce his own acquaintance, and did use To hear himself reported but as news, So distant from himself, that one might dare To say those two were nere familiar. Whose polishid phancy hath so smoothly wrought, That 'tis suspected, and might tempt our thought, To guesse it spent in every birth, so writ: Not as the gift Legacy of wit: Whose unbid brain drops so much flowing worth, That others are delivered, he brought forth; That did not course in wit, and beat at least Ten lines in fallow to put up one Iest; VVhich still prevents our thought, we need not stay To th'end, the Epigram is in the way. The Town might here grow Poet, nay tis se'd Some Mui'ors could hence as eas'ly rime as read; VVhose losse we so much weep, we cannot hear His very Comedyes without a tear: And when we read his mirth, are fain to pray Leave from our grief to call the work a Play: VVhere fancy playes with judgement, and so fits That'ts enough to make a guard of wits; VVhere lines fulfill themselves, and are so right That but a combats mention is a fight, His phrase does bring to passe, and he has lent Language enough, to give the things Event; The Lines pronounce themselves, and we may say The Actors were but Echoes to the Play: Me thinks the book does Act, and we not doubt To say it rather enters than comes out: VVhich even you seem to envy, whose device, Has made it viler even by its price. And taught its value, which we count so great That when we buy it cheapest we but cheat; And when upon one page we blesse our look, How ere wee bargain we have gain'd the book: Fresh-men in this are forc't to have their right, And tis no purchase though t'were sold in spight. So do we owe you still, that let us know He gave the world the Playes, and you the Show. IOS. HOWE. Trin. Col. Oxon. On his beloved friend the Author, and his ingenious Poems. What need these busie wits? who hath a Mine His own, thus rich, needs not the scatter'd shine Of lesser heaps: Day dims a Tapers light and Lamps are uselesse where there is no night Why this train of writers? forraign Verse Can adde no honour to a Poet's hearse, VVhose every line which he to paper lent, Builds for himself a lasting Monument. Brave Verse this priviledge hath; though all be dumb, That is the Authors Epitaph and Tomb. Which when ambitious Pyles, th'ostents of Pride To dust shall fall, and in their ruins hide Their then no more remembred Founders name: These (like Apollo ever young) shall fame The first composer, whose weigh'd works shall tell VVhat noble thoughts did in his bosome dwell. But now I find the cause: they that do praise Desert in others, for themselves plant Bayes: For he that praises merit loves it, thus Hee's good, for goodnesse that's solicitous. Else, though He diamonds keenly pointed write, Thay but proclaim a quainter Hypocrite: Thus in the future it shall honour be, Thet men shall read their names bound up with thee. So Countery Moles that would at Court appear Intrude some Camels train that does live there. So Creatures that had drown'd else, did imbark With Noah, and liv'd by being in his Ark Or if not thus; as when in royall state Nobles attend Kings to inagurate: Or as last year when you both Courts did see Beget joyes noon in 'th' Vniversity; All the learn'd tribe in reverend Habits meet, As if the Schools were turnd into the street; VVhere each one strove such duty to put on, As might give honour to their own Suns Sun. Such honour here our dimmer pens would have, In pomp to wait him to his solemn grave: Since what he was, his own fruits better show, Then those which planted here by others grow. Rich jewels in themselves such lustre cast, As gold about them, is no grace but wast. Such was his Genius, like the quick eyes wink, He could write sooner then another think. His play was Fancies flame, a lightning wit, So shot, that it could sooner pierce then hit. What e're he pleas'd, though but in sport to prove, Appear'd as true, as pity dwells with love. Had he said thus, That discreet zeale might stand Both with the Jesuite, and the Puritan, T'had been believ'd; That frost from heat proceeds, That chastity from ease, and fulnesse breeds; That women ought to woo, as Eve at first Woo'd Man, to make the world, and man accurst; All would be taken up for truth: and sense Which knew truth coming, would not going hence. Had he maintain'd Rich Lucans work had been Meer History; there would no pen be seen To call it Poem: If for Cæsar stood, Great Pompey should be neither weak, nor Good: Oh! had he liv'd to plead the craggy Law, Which now unsetled holds the world in awe; He would have met some Ostracisme, I fear, Lest he had charm'd the purple Judge to erre. Nor could he only in his natve speech Robe his ripe thoughts; but even the Copious, Rich, And lofty Greek, with Latine, did appear In him, as Orient in their proper sphear: That when in them, himself he pleas'd t'expresse, The ravisht hearer could not but confesse, He might as well old Rome, Athens Claim, For birth, as Britain, circl'd with the Main. Tis true, we have these languages still left; But spoken, as Apparrell got by theft. Is worn: disguis'd, and shadowed; Had he Liv'd but with us, till grave maturity; Though we should ever in his change have lost, We might have gain'd enough whereof to boast. Our nations better Genius; but now Our hopes are nip'ter' they began to blow. And sure I am, his losse must needs strike deep, For whom in verse, thus Englands eye doth weep. VVhose tears thus dew'd upon his mournful dust I will not longer trouble. They that must Carp though at best things, let them onely read: These Poems here will strike that humour dead. VVhich I should praise too: but in them I see There is one blemish, for he hath nam'd me: Else, Ile not think tbe Reader so distrest In wit, but that he will admire the rest. Concluding thence though in his forenoon-youth, (And what I now shall write is modest truth,) He knows not him, who doth so much excell, That could so quickly, do so much, so well. OVVEN FELTHAM. Gent. On the death of Mr. Randolph. When Donne, and Beaumount dyed, an Epitaph Some men (I well remember) thought unsafe; And said they did presume to write, unlesse They could their tears in their expression dresse. But love makes me more bold, and tells me I, In humble tearms to vent my piety May safely dare; and reason thinks not fit, For which I lov'd, I now should fear that wit, Respect looks like a bargain, if confin'd To rules precise; and is more just then kind, If by a poiz'd and equall testament It turnes good-will into a covenant Must every present offered to a prince Be just proportion'd to his eminence? Or ought my Elegy unjust be thought Because I cannot mourn thee as I ought? Such laws as these, (if any be so bold) Ought those unskilfull but proud souls to hold, VVho think they could and did, at a due rate Love thee, not me, whose love was passionate. And hath decreed, how ere the censure go, Thus much, although but thus, to let men know, I do admire no Coment did presage The mournfull period of thy wonder'd age, Or that no Sybill did thy death fore-tell, Since that by it alone more ill befel The Laurell. God, then when the day was come VVherein his Delphick-Oracle was dumb: In meaner wits that proverb chance may hold (That they who are soon ripe are seldom old) But t'was a poore one, and for thee unfit, VVhose infancy might teach their best years witt; Whose talk was exemplary to their pains, And whose discourse was tutor to their strains; If thou wert serious, then the audience Heard Plato's works in Tulli's eloquence: I said, the mourners knew no thrifty size In tears, but still cri'd out, oh lend more eyes. If merry, then the juyce of Comedy So sweetned every word, that we might see Each stander by having enough to do To temper mirth, untill some friend could wo Thee take the pains to write, that so that pressure Checking the souls quick motions, some small leasure Might be obtain'd to make provision Of breath, against the next Scen's action. I could go through thy works, which will surviue The funerall of time; and gladly strive Beyond my power, to make that love appear Which after death is best seen in a tear; But praising one, I should dispraise the rest, Since whatsoere thou didst, was still the best: Since then I am perswaded that in thee Wit at her acmie was, and we shall see Posterity not daring to aspire To equalize, but only to admire Thee as their Arch type: with thought of thee Henceforth I'le thus enrich my memory. While others count from Earth-quakes, and great frost; And say, i'th last dear year, t'would thus much cost: My time distinctions this shall be among, Since Wits-decay, or Randolphs death,—so long. R. Gostelovv. M. A. To the pious Memory of my deare Brother in-law, M. Thomas Randolph. Readers, prepare your Faith; who truly tells His History, must needs write miracles. He lisp'd Wit worthy th'Presse, as if that he Had us'd his Cradle as a Library. Some of these Fruits had birth, when other Boyes (His elders) playd with Nuts, Books were his Toyes. He had not long of Playes spectator been But his small Feet wore Socks sit for the Scene. He was not like those costive Wits, who blot A quire of Paper to contrive a Plot, And ere they name it, till it, crostr tit look Raced with wounds like an old mercers Book. What pleas'd this year, is next in pieces torn, It suffers many deaths ere it be born. For Humours to lie leidger they are seen Oft in a Tavern, and a bowling-green. They do observe each place, and company, As strictly as a Traveller or Spye. And deifying dung-hills seem t'adore The scum of people, Watch-man, Changling, Whore, To know the vice, and ignorance of all, With any Rags they'le drink a pot of Ale: Nay, what is more (a strange unusuall thing With Poets) they will pay the reckoning; And sit with patience an hour by the Heels To learn the Non-sense of the Constables. Such Jig-like flim-flams being got to make The Rable laugh, and Nut-cracking forsake, They go home (if th'have any) and there sit In Gown and night-cap looking for some wit. Ere they compose, they must for along space Be dieted as Horses for the race. They must not Bacon, Beef, or Pudding eat, A jest may chance be starv'd with such grosse meat. The good hour come, and their Brain tun'd they write But slow as dying men their wills indite. They pen by drams and scruples, from their quill Words (although dreggy) flow not, but distill. They state, and sower their faces; nay to vent The Brains, they eat their fingers excrement: And search their heads, as if they weer about (Their wit so hide-bound is) to pull it out. Every bald speech though Comicall it be To their rack't members, proves a Tragedie. When they have had the Councell of some friend, And of their begging Epilogue made an end. Their Play saluts the world, and claims the Stage For its inheritance being now of Age. But while They pomp't their Phancy day and night He nothing harder found then not to write. No diet could corrupt or mend his strain, All tempers were the best to his sure Brain. He could with raptures captivate the King, Yet not endanger Button, or Band-string. Poems from him gush't out so readily As if they'd onely been in's Memory? Yet are they with as marble fancies wrought, As theirs whose pen writes for the thirteenth thought. They erre who say, Things quickly done soon fade: Nature and hee, all in an instant made. Those that do measure Phansies by the glasse, And dote on such as cost more time, may passe In ranck with guls, whom folly doth intice To think that best that has the greatest price. Who poring on their spungy brain, still squeez, Neglect the cream, and onely save the Lees. Stopping their flying quill, they clip fames wing. Make Helicon a puddle, thats a Spring. Nor was his hast hood-winckt; his rage was wise His fury councell had, his rashnesse eyes. Though he (as Engins arrows) shot forth wit, Yet aym'd withall the proper marks to hit. His Ink nere stain'd the Surplice; he doth right That sometimes takes a care to misse the white. He turn'd no Scripture-phrase into a jest; He was inspir'd with raptures, not possest. Some Divelish Poets think their Muse does ill Vnlesse their verses do prophane or kill. They boldly write what I should fear to think, words that do pale their paper, black their Ink. The Titles of their Satyers fright some, more Then Lord have mercy, write upon a doore. Although his wit was sharp as anothers, yet It never wounded; thus a Razer set In a wise Barbars hand tickles the skin, And leaves a smooth, not carbonaded chin. So soveraigne was his phansy, that you'd think His quickening pen did Balsam drop, not Ink. Read's Elegies, and you will see his praise Doth many souls fore th' Resurection raise, No venoms in his book; his very Snake You may as safely as a flower take. There's none needs fear to furfet with his phrase, He has no Gyant raptures to amaze And torture weake capacities with wonder: He (by his Laurell guarded) ne're did thunder As those strong bumbast wits, whose Poetry Sounds like a Charm, or Spanish Pedigree. Who with their phancy towring 'bove the Sun, Have in their stile Babels confusion. If puny eyes do read their verses, they Will think 'tis Hebrew, writ the English way. His lines do run smooth as the feet of time; Each leafe though rich, swells not with gouty rime. Here is no thrum, or knot; Arachne ne're Weav'd a more even webb; and as they are Listed for smoothnesse, so in this again That each thread's spun and warp'd by his own brain. We have some Poetasters, who although They ne're beyond the writing school did go, Sit at Apollo's Table, when as they But Midwives are, not Parents to a Play. Were they betrai'd, they'd be each Coblers scoff, Laught at, as one whose Periwig's blown off. Their Brains lie all in Notes; Lord how they'd look If they should chance to lose their Table book! Their Bayes, like Ivy, cannot mount at all But by some neighbouring tree, or joyning wall. VVith what an extasie shall we behold This book, which is no Ghost of any old VVorm-eaten Author: here's no jest, or hint, But had his Head both for it's O're and Mint, VVer't not for some Translations, none could know VVhether he had e're look'd in book or no. He could discourse of any subject, yet No cold premeditated sense repeat; As he that nothing at the Table talks But what was cook'd in's study, or the walks, Whose wit (like a Sun-dill) onely can Go true in this, or that Miridian. Each Climate was to him his proper Sphear; You'd think he had been brought up everywhere. Was he at Court? his Complements would be Rich wrought with Phansies best embroidery, Which the spruse Gallants Echo like would speak So oft, as they'd be thred-bare in a week. They lov'd even his Abuses, the same jeer (So witty 'twas) would sting and please their ear. Read's flowry Pastoralls, and you will swear He was not Iohnsons onely, but Pans Heire. His smooth Amyntas would perswade even me To think he alwayes liv'd in Sicilie. Those happier Groves that shaded him, were all As Trees of knowledge, and Propheticall: Dodon's were but the type of them, Leaves were Bookes in old time, but became Schollers here. Had he lived till Westminster Hall was seen In Forrest Towns, perhaps he fin'd had been. Whilst others made Trees May poles, he could do As Orpheus did, and make them dancers too. But these were the light sports of his spare time, He was as able to dispute, as time And all (two gifts neere joyn'd before) out went As well in Syllogesme as Complement. Who lookes within his cleerer Glasse, will say At once he writ an Ethick Tract and Play. VVhen he in Cambridge Schools did Moderate, (Truth never found a subtler Advocate) He had as many Auditors, as those VVho preach, their mouthes being Silenc't, through the Nose. The Grave Divines stood gazing, as if there In words was colour, or in th eye an ear: To hear him they would penetrate each other, Embrace a throng, and love a noysome smother, Though plodding Pates much time and oyl had spent In beating out an obscure Argument. He could untie, not break, the subtlest knot Their puzeling Art could weave; nay he had got The trick on't so, as if that he had been Within each Brain, and the nice folding seen. Who went toh'Schools Peripateticks, came, If he disputed home in Plato's name. His Oppositions were as Text; some le'd With wonder, thought he had not urg'd but read. Nor was his judgement all Phillosophy; He was in points of deep Divinity. Onely Not Doctor; his true Catholique Brain The learning of a Councell did contain, But all his works are lost, his Fire is out These are but's Ashes, which were thrown about, And now rak'd up together, all we have With pious sacriledge snatch'd from his Grave. Are a few meteors, which may make it se'd That Tom is yet alive, but Randolph's dead. Thus when a Marchant's posting o're the sea With his rich loaden Sip is cast away. Some light small wares do swim unto the shore, But the great and solid prizes nere rise more. RIC WETS. Bac. of Arts, and student of Christs Church. ON THE INESTIMABLE Content he injoyes in the Muses; to those of his Friends that dehort him from Poetry Go sordid earth, and hope not to bewitch My high-born roule, that flies a nobler pitch Thou canst not tempt her with adulterate show, Shee bears no appetite that flags so low. Should both the Indies spread ther laps to me, And court mine eyes to wish my Treasurie, My better will they never could entice; Nor this with gold, nor that with all her spice. For what poore things had these possessions shown, When all were mine, but I were not mine own. Others in pompous wealth their thoughts may please. And I am rich in wishing none of these. For say, which happinesse would you beg first, Still to have drink, or never to have thirst. No servants on my beck attendant stand, Yet are my passions all at my command; Reason within me shall sole ruler be. And every sense shall weare his livery. Lord of my self in chief; when they that have More wealth, make that their Lord, which is my slave. Yet I as well as they, with more content Have in my self a Houshold government. My intellectuall soule hath there possest The Stuards place, to govern all the rest. When I go forth my Eyes two Vshers are, And dutifully walk before me bare, My Leggs run footmen by me. Go or stand My ready Arms wait close on either hand: My Lips are Porters to the dangerous dore: And either Ear a trusty Auditor. And when abroad I go, Fancy shall be My skilful Coach man, and shall hurry me Through Heaven and Earth, and Neptun's watry Plaine, And in a moment drive me back again. The charge of all my Cellar, Thirst, is thine; Thou Butler art, and Yeoman of my Wine. Stomack the Cook whose dishes best delight, Because their onely sawce is Appetite. My other Cook Digestion; where to me Teeth crave, and Palat will the Taster he. And the two Eye-lids, when I go to sleep, Like careful Grooms my silent chamber keep. Where lest a cold oppresse my vitall part, A gentle fire is kindled by the Heart. And lest too great a heat procure my pain, The Lungs fan wind to cool those parts again. VVithin the inner closset of my brain Attend the nobler members of my train. Invention Master of my Mint grows there, And Memory my faithfull Treasurer, And though in others tis a treacherous part, My tongue is Secretary to my heart. And then the Pages of my soul and sense, Love, Anger, Pleasure, Grief, Concupiscence, And all affections else, are taught t'obey, Like Subjects, not like favourites to sway. This is my Mannor house, and men shall see I here live Master of my family. Say then thou man of wealth; In what degree May thy proup fortunes, over-ballance me? Thy many Barks plough the rough Oceans back; And I am never frighted with a wrack. Thy flocks of sheep are numberlesse to tell, And with one fleece I can be cloth'd as well, Thou hast a thousand severall farmes to let, And I do feed on ne're a Tennnts sweat. Thou hast the Commons to Inclosure brought; And I have fixt a bound to my vast thought. Variety is sought for to delight Thy witty and ambitious Appetite, Three Elements, at least, dispeopled be, To satisfie juditious gluttony And yet for this I love my Commons here, Above the choicest of thy dainty cheer. No widows curse caters a dish of mine, I drink no tears of Orphans in my wine. Thou mayst perchance to some great office come, And I can rule a Common-wealth at home. And that preheminence injoy more free, Then thou puft up with vain Authority. VVhat boots it him a large command to have, Whose every part is some poor vices slave? Which over him as proudly Lords it there, As o're the rustick he can domineer. VVhilst he poor Swains doth threat, in his own eyes Lust and Concupiscence do Tyranize. Ambition wracks his heart with jealous fear, And bastard flattery captivates his ear. He on posterity may fix his care, And I can study on the times that were. He stands upon a pinacle, to show His dangerous hight? whilst I sit safe below. Thy father hords up gold for thee to spend, VVhen death will play the office of a friend, And take him hence, which yet he thinks too late: My nothing to inherit is a fate. Above thy birth-right, should it double be; No longing expectation tortures me. I can my fathers reverent head survay, And yet not wish that every hair were gray. My constant Genins sayes I happier stand, And richer in his, life then in his land. And when thou hast an heir that for thy gold VVill think each day makes thee a year too old; And ever gaping to possesse thy store, Conceives thy age to be above fourscore. 'Cause his is one and twenty, and will pray The too slow hours to hast, and every day Bespeak thy Coffin, cursing every bell, That he hears toll, 'cause 'tis anothers knell: (And justly at thy life he may repine, But his is but a wardship during thine.) Mine shall have no such thoughts, if I have one He shall be more a pupill then a sonne: And at my grave weep truth, and say deaths hand, That bountifully unto thine gave land, But rob'd him of a Tutor; Cursed store! There is no pietie, but amongst the poor. Go then confesse which of us fathers be The happier made in our posterity; I in my Orphan that hath nought beside His vertue, thou in thy rich parricide- Thou severall Artists dost imploy to show The measure of thy lands; that thou myst know How much of earth thou hast: while I do call My thoughts to scan how little 'tis in all Thou hast thy hounds to hunt the timorus Hare, The crafty Fox, or the more nobler Deer; Till at a fault, perchance thy Lordship be, And some poor city varlet hunt for thee. For 'is not poor Actæans fault alone: Hounds have devour'd more Masters sure then one. VVhilst I the while pursuing my content, VVith the quick Nostrels of a judgement, sent The hidden steps of nature, and there see Your game maintain'd by her Antipathye. Thou hast a Hawk, and to that hight doth flye Thy understanding if it sore too high: VVhile I my soul with Eagles Pinions wing. To stoop at Heaven, and in her Tallons bring A glorious constellation, sporting there VVith him whose belt of stars adornes the Sphear. Thou hast thy lant-skips, and the painters try, VVith all their skill to please thy wanton eye. Here shaddowy groves, and craggy mountains there; Here rivers headlong fall, there springs run cleer, The Heavens bright Raise through clouds most azure shrew Circuled about with Iris gawdy bow. And what of this? I reall Heavens do see, True springs, true gooves; whilst yours but shadows be. Nor of your houshold stuffe so proudly boast, Compos'd of curiosity and cost. Your two best chambers are unfurnished, Th' inner and upper roome, the breast and head. But you will say, The comfort of a life, Is in the partner of your joyes, a wife. You may have choice of birds, you need not wo, The rich, the faier; they both are profered you: But what fond virgin will my love prefer, That onely in Parnassus joyturs her? Yet thy base match I scorn, an honest pride I harbour here that scorns a market bride. Neglected beauty now is priz'd by gold; And sacred love is basely bought and sold. VVives are grown traffique, marriage is a trade, And when a numptiall of two hearts is made, There must of moneys to a wedding be, That coyn as well as men may multiply. O humane blindnesse! had we eyes to see, There is no wealth to valiant Poetry! And yet what want I Heaven or earth can yeeld? Methinks I now possesse the Elsim field. Into my chest the yellow Tagus flowes, VVhile my plate-fleet in bright Pactolas rowes. Th'Hesperian Orchard's mine: mine is all: Thus am I rich in wealth Poeticall. VVhy strive you then my friends to circumvent My soul, and rob me of my best content? VVhy out of ignorant love counsell you me To leave the Muses and my Poetry? Which should I leave and never follow more, I might perchance get riches and be poor. In anguem, qui Lycoris in dormientem amplexus est. Englished thus ???????????? The original Latin verse has been omitted here. The Spring was come, and all the fields grown fine; My flame Lycoris like young Proserpine Went forth to gather flowers, bettring their sent They took more sweetnesse from her, then they lent. Now loaden with her harvest, and o'represt With her sweet toyl, she laid her down to rest, Lillies did strow her couch, and proud were grown To bear a whitenesse purer then their own. Roses fell down soft pillows to her head, And blusht themselves into a deeper red To emulate her cheeks: Flora did set Her maids to work to weave the Violet Into a purple rugge, to shield the fair Lycoris from the malice of the Air; When lo a snake hid in the neighbour bowres (Ah who could think treason should lurk in flowrs?) Shoots forth her checker'd skin, and gently creeps O're my Lycoris that as gently sleeps. I saw it, and a sudden frost possest My frighted soule in my then troubled brest. What fears appear'd not to my mind and me? Thou first wert call'd bemoan'd Enridice, By Serpents envy forced to expire, From Orpheus rapt, and his death-conquering lyre: But when I found he wore a guiltlesse sting, And more of love did then of treason bring: How quickly could my former fear depart, And to a greater leave my jealous heart! For the smooth Viper every member scands, Africk he loaths now, and the barren sands That nurst him, wondring at the glorious sight Of thighes and belly, and the brests more white Then their own milk, Ah might I still (quoth he) Crawl in such fields, 'twixt two such mountains be! There me he spied, and fearing to be seen; Shrowds to her neck, thinking t'had Lillies been. But viewing her bright cheeks, he soon did cry. Under your Roses shall I safer lye. Thence did her fore-head with full veins appear, Good heaven (quoth he) what violets grow here On this clear Promontory? Hence he slides Vp to her locks, and through her tresses glydes, Her yellow tresses; dazel'd to behold A glistring grove, an intire wood of Gold. Th'Hesperian wood he thinks he now hath seen, That thought, but now, they had an Orchard been; For leaves and boughes the Archimenian Vine, The Dodan Oak, and the Thessalian Pine Must yeeld to these; no Trees so bright as they, Nor Paphian Myrtles, nor Pentian Bay! Joy now fill'd all his brest, no timerous fear Of danger could find room to harbour there. Down slips he, and about each limb he hurls His wanton body into numerous curles. And while his tail had thrown it self a chain About her neck, his head bears up again; With his black lips her warmer lips he greets, And there with kisses steept in Nectar meets. Thence Zephyrs breath he sucks, then doth he smell Perfumes that all th'Aræbian gums excell. And spices that do build the Phœnix Pyre, When she renews her youth in funerall fire. Nor seeks he poyson there, but like the Bee That on Mount Hybla plies her husbandry, He gathers honey thence, now, now I know With Aristeus Flocks a Snake may go. Ah cold at heart, I fear'd some heavenly sleight. And Iove my rivall; that his old deceit Had once again this borrowed shape put on To court my Nymph, as he Dedis won, Up lift the Snake his head (for pleasure now Held all his soul) and with erected brow To flatter's Love he sung; he strives to play, And hisses forth a well tun'd Rounde lay. This wakes the Nymph, her eyes admit the day; Here flowers, and there her scattered Garlands lay, Which as she picks up, and with Bents reties, She in her lap the speckled Serpent spies. The Nymph no sign of any terrour shows, (How bold is beauty when her strength she knows!) And in her hand the tender worm she grasp'd, While it sometime about her finger clasp'd A ring enamel'd, then her tender wast In manner of a girdle round imbrac'e, And now upon her a bracelet hung, Where for the greater ornament she flung His limber body into severall folds, And twenty winding figures, where it holds Her amorous pulse, in many a various twist, And many a Love-knot ties upon her wrist. Lycoris to the gods thou art too dear, And top too much of heaven belov'd I fear. This or that Nymph's the Red-sea spoyls may be. But Lybia ne're sent Jewels but to thee. What s're to us are deaths and poysons sent, Desire to be Lycoris Ornament: For that same little Spider that hangs up, Together with her web on the house top, When she beheld the Snake a bracelet made, Stuck with an evy, and a love; she said, And shall a Snake a Gemme Lycoris be, And such bright form receive no tires from me? Then flings her nets away, and throwing by Her subtle toyl she sets to catch the fly, To th'loom Arachne goes, and plyes it there To work a roab for my Lycoris weare. But thou, o Serpent, which so blest can be To reap those joyes for which I envy thee: That happy worm, upon her lip fast hung, Sucking in kisses with thy three fork'd tongue (So may'st thou age and skin together cast, And oft recall thy youth, when it is past,) Teach my Lycoris what your Arts may be, Let her th'Ingredients of thy Cordials see. That she may ne're grow old, that times dull plow May never print a wrinckle in her brow. I charge thee in thy powerfull Cupids name, May a new beauty alwayes and the same Lycoris shew; ne're may she in her glasse Look for her owne, ad find anothers face. Venus for beauty may she then appear When she has liv'd to old Sybilla's year; And when, dark Snake, thou wilt no more renew Thy youthfull vigour, bid base earth adiew; And glory to the night, or from his sphear Huge Python pull and fix thy torches there: Where like a river thou shalt bending go, And through the Orb a starry torrent flow. And thou Dycoris, when th'art pleas'd to take No more of life, next thy beloved Snake Shine forth a constellation, full, and bright; Blesse the poor heavens with more majestick light, Who in requitall shall present you there, Ariadnasses Crown, and Cassiopæis Chair. A complaint against Cupid, that he never made him in Love. How many of thy Captives (Love) complain Thou yoak'st thy slaves in too severe a chain? I have heard 'em their Poetique malice show, To curse thy Quiver, and blaspheme thy Bow. Calling thee Boy, and blind, threatning the rod; Prophanely swearing that thou art no god. Or if thou be; not from the starry place, But born below, and of the Stygian race. But yet these Atheists that thy shasts dislike, Thou canst be friendly too, and deign to strike. This on his Cloris spends his thoughts and time; That chaunts Corinna in his amorous rhime: A third speaks raptures, and hath gain'd a wit By praising Cælia; else had mist of it. But I that think there can no freedome be, (Cupid) so sweet as thy Captivity; I that could wish thy chains, and live content To wear them, not thy Gives, but ornament? I that could any ransome pay to thee, Not to redeem, but sell my liberty. I am neglected. Let the cause be known; Art thou a niggard of thy arrows grown, That were so prodigall; or dost thou please To set thy Pillars up with Hercules Weary of conquest? or should I disgrace Thy victories, if I were deign'd a place Amongst thy other Trophies? none of these, Witnesse thy daily triumphs: who, but sees Thou still pursuest thy game from high to low; No age, no Sex can scape thy powerfull bow. Decrepit age whose veins and bones may be An Argument against Phylosophy, To prove an emptinesse; that has no sense Left but his feeling, feels thy influence; And dying dotes: not babes thy shafts can misse; How quickly Infants can be taught to kisse! As the poor Apes being dumb these words would borrow I was born to day to get a babe to morrow. Each Plow-man thy propitious wounds can prove, Tilling the earth, and wishing 'twere his Love. Am I invulnerable? is the dart Rebeaten, which thou level'st at my heart? I'le rest my Parents bones, if they have done As Tethis once did to her god like son The great Achilles, dipt in Stygian lake: Though I am so, Cupid, thy arrows take, Try where I am not proof, and let me feel Thy archery, if not i'th heart, i'th heel. Perchance my heart lies there; who would not be A Coward, to be valiant made by thee. I cannot say thy blindnesse is the cause, That I am barr'd the freedome of thy laws; The wretched out-Law of thy Mothers Court, That place of comfort, Paradise of sport. For they may say, that say thou blind canst be, Eagles want eyes, and only moles can see. Not Argus with so many lights did shine, For each fair Ladies sparkling eyes are thine. Think'st thou because I do the Muses love, I in thy Camp would a faint souldier prove? How came Musæus and Anacreon then Into thy troops? how came Tibullus pen Amongst thy spears, and how came Ovid (say) To be enrol'd great Generall in thy pay? And doubt'st thou me? suspect you I will tell The hidden mysteries of your Paphian cell, To the strait lac't Diana? or betray The secrets of the night unto the day? No, Cupid, by thy Mothers doves I swear, And by her sparrows, 'tis an idle fear. If Philomel descend to sport with me, Know I can be (great Love) as dumb as she. Though she hath lost her tongue; in such delights All should be like her, only talk by nights: Make me thy Priest (if Poets truth divine) I'le make the Muses wanton, at thy shrine They all shall wait, and Dian's self shall be A votresse to thy Mothers Nunnery. When zeale with nature shall maintain no strife, Where none swear chastity, and single life. To Venus-Nuns an easier oath is read, She breaks her vow, that keeps her maiden-head. Reject not then your Flamin's ministry: Let me but Deacon in thy Temples be: And see how I shall touch my powerfull lyre, And more inspir'd with thine then Phœbus fire, Chaunt such a moving verse, as soone should frame Desire of dalliance in the coyest dame, Melting to amorous thoughts her heart of stone, And force her to untrusse her Virgin Zone. Is Lucrece or Penelope alive? Give me a Spartan Matron, Sabine Wife, Or any of the Vestalls hither call, And I wilil make them be thy converts all. Who like good Proselytes more in heart then show, Shall to thy origies all so zealous goe. That Thais shall, nor Helen such appear; As if they only Loves precians were. But now my Muse dull heavy numbers sings, Cupid 'tis thou alone giv'st verse her wings. The Lawrell wreath I never shall obtain, Unlesse thy torch illuminate my brain. Love Lawrell gives; Phœbus as much can say, Had not he lov'd, there had not been the Bay. Why is my Presentation then put by? Who is't that my Induction dares deny? Can any Lady say I am unfit? If so, I'le sue my Quare Impedit. I'm young enough, my spirits quick and good, My veins swell high with kind and active blood. Nor am I marble; when I see an eye Quick, bright, and full, rai'd round with majesty; I feel my heart with a strange heat opprest. As 'twere a lightning darted through my breast. I long not for the cherries on the Tree, So much as those which on a lip I see. And more affection bear I to the Rose That in a cheek, then in a garden grows. I gaze on beauteous Virgins with delight: And feel my temper vary at the sight; I know not why, but warmer streams do glide Thorow my veins, sure 'tis a wanton tide. But you perchance esteem my love the lesse, Because I have a foolish bashfulnesse, A shame-fac'd rose you find within my face, Whose modest blush frights you from my embrace; That's ready now to fall, if you'l but deign To pluck it once, it shall not grow again. Or do you therefore cast my love away, Because I am not expert in the play? My skil's not known till it be ventred on; I have not Aristotle read alone; I am in Ovid a proficient too; And if you'd heare my Lecture, could to you Analize all his Art, with so much more Judgment and skill then e're was taught before; That I might be chief Master, he, dull fool, The under-usher in the Cyprian Scool: For petty Pædagogue, poor pedant, he First writ the Art, and then the remedy: But I could set down rules of love so sure. As should exceed Art, and admit no cure. Pictures I could invent (Love, vvere I thine) As might stand Copies unto Aretine And such new dalliance study, as should frame Variety in that which is the same. I am not then uncapable (great Love) Would'st thou my skill but with one arrow prove, Give me a Mistresse in whose looks to joy, And such a Mistresse (Love) as will be coy. Not easily won, though to be won in time; That from her nicenesse I may store my thime: Then in a thousand sighs to thee I'le pay My Morning Orisons, and everyday Two thousand groans, and count these amorous prayers I make to thee, not by my Beads but tears. Besides, each day I'le write an Elegy, And in as lamentable Poetry As any Inns of Court-man, that hath gone To buy an Ovid with a Littleton. But (Love) I see you will not entertain Those that desire to live amidst your train; For death, and you have got a trick to flye From such poor wretches as do wish you nigh. You scorn a yeelding slave; and plainly show it, Those that contemn your power you make to know it. And such am I; I slight your proud commands; I marl you put a Bow into your hands; A Hobby-horse, or some such pretty toy, A rattle would befit you better, Boy. You conquer gods and men? how stand I free, That will acknowledg no supremacy Unto your churlishgod-head? does it cry? Give it a plum to still it's deity. Good Venus let it suck; that it may keep Lesse brawling; gentle Nurse rock it a sleep, Or if you be past Baby, and are now Come to wear breeches, must we then allow Your Boy-ship leave to shoot at whom you please? No, whip it for such wanton trics as these: If this do anger you, I'le send a Bee, Shall to a single duell challnege thee: And make you to your Mam run, and complain, The little serpent stung thee once again. Go hunt the Butter-flies, and if you can But catch 'em, make their wings into a fan. Wee'l give you leave to hunt, and sport at them, So you let me alone,—But I blaspheme (Great Love) I feare I have offended thee, If so, be mercifull—and punish me. A gratulatory to Mr. Ben Johnson, for adopting him to be his sonne. I was not born to Helicon, nor dare Presume to think my self a Muses heir. I have no title to Parnassus hill. Nor any Acre of it by the will Of a dead Ancestour, nor could I be Ought but a tenant unto Poetry. But thy Adoption quits me of all feare, And makes me challenge a childs portion there. I am a kinne to Heroes being thine, And part of my alliance is divine, Orphæus, Musæus, Homer too, beside Thy Brothers by the Roman Mothers side; As Ovid, Virgil, and the Latine Lyre, That is so like thee, Horace: the whole Quire Of Poets are by thy Adoption, all My Uncles: thou hast given me power to call Phœbus himself my Grandsire; by this graunt Each Sister of the nine is made my Aunt. Go you that reckon from a large descent Your lineall honours, and are well content To glory in the age of your great name, Though on a Heralds faith you build the same: I do not envy you, nor think you blest Though you may bear a Gorgon on your Crest By direct line from Persons; I will boast No farther then my Father, that's the most I can or should be proud of; and I were Unworthy his adoption, if that here I should be dully modest, boast I must Being son of his Adoption, not his lust. And to say truth, that which is best in me May call you Father, 'twas begot by thee. Have I a spark of that cælestiall flame Within me. I confesse I stole the same Promotheus like from thee; and may I feed His Vulture, when I dare deny the deed. Many more Moons thau hast, that shine by night All Bankrupts, wer't not for a borrow'd light; Yet can forswear it, I the debt confesse, And think my reputation ne're the lesse. For Father let me be resolv'd by you; It's a disparagement from rich Peru To ravish gold; or theft, for wealthy Ore To ransack Tagus, or Pactolus shore? Or does he wrong Alcinous, that for want Doth take from him a sprig or two, to plant A lesser Orchard? sure it cannot be: Nor is it theft to steale some flames from thee. Graunt this, and I'le cry guilty, as I am, And pay a filiall reverence to thy name. For when my Muse upon obedient knees Asks not her Fathers blessing, let her leese The fame of this Adoption; 'tis a curse I wish her 'cause I cannot think a worse. And here, as Piety bids me, I intreat Phœbus to lend thee some of his own heat, To cure thy Palsie; else I will complain He has no skill in hearbs; Poets in vain Make him the god of Physick, 'twere his praise To make thee as immortall as thy Bayes; As his own Daphne, 'twere a shame to see The god not love his Priest, more then his Tree. But if heaven take thee, envying us thy Lyre, 'Tis to pen Anthems for an Angels quire. In Lesbiam, &amp; Histrionem. I wonder what should Madam Lesbia mean To keep young Histrio, and for what scene So bravely she maintains him, that what sense He please to blesse, 'tis done at her expence! The play-boy spends secure; he shall have more, As if both Indies did supply his store. As if he did in bright Pactolus swim, Or Tagus yellow waves did water him, And yet has no revenews to defray These charges, but the Madam, she must pay 'Tis prodigall disbursments: Madams are To such as he, more then a treble share. She payes (which is more then she needs to do) For her own coming in, and for his too. This is reward due to the sacred sin; No charge too much done to the beardlesse chin Although she stint her poor old Knight Sir John To live upon his exhibition, His hundred marks per annum, when her joy, Her sanguine darling, her spruce active boy May scatter Angels; rub out silks, and shine In cloths of gold; cry loud the world is mine: Keep his Race-nags, and in Hide-park be seen Brisk as the best (as if the stage had been Crown the Courts Rivall) can to Brackly go, To Lincoln Race, and to New-market too; At each of these his hundred pounds has vie'd On Peggabrigs, or Shotten herrings side; And loses without swearing. Let them curse That neither have a Fortunatus purse, Nor such a Madam; if this world do hold (As very likely 'twill) Madams grown old Will be the best Monopolies; Histrio may At Maw, or Gleek, or at Primero play, Still Madam goes to stake, Histrio knows Her worth, and therefore dices too; and goes As deep, the Caster, as the only Son Of a dead Alderman, come to twenty one A whole week since: you'd know the reason why Lesbia does this, guesse you as well as I; Then this I can no better reason tell, 'Tis 'cause he playes the womans part so well. I see old Madams are not only toyle, No tilth so fruitfull as a barren soile. Ah poor day-labourers, how I pity you That shrink, and sweat to live with much ado! When had you wit to understand the right, 'Twere better wages to have work'd by night. Yet some that resting here, do only think That youth with age is an unequall link, Conclude, that Histrias task as hard must be, As was Mezentius bloody cruelty. Who made the living to embrace the dead, And so expire, but I am rather lead His bargain of the two the best to call, He at one game keeps her, she him at all. De Histrice, Ex Claudiano. Fam'd Stymphal, I have heard, thy birds in flight Shot showers of arrows forth, all levied right. And long the fable of those quils of steele Did seem to me a tale incredible. Now have I faith; the Porcupine I see, And then th'Herculean birds no wonders be. Her longer head like a swines snout doth show; Brisles like horns upon her fore head grow, A fiery heat glows from her flaming eye, Under her shaggy back the shape doth lye As 'twere a whelp: nature her Art hath try'd In this small beast so strangely fortified A threatning wood o're all her body stands, And stiffe with Pikes the speckled stalks in bands Grow to the warre; while under those doth rise An other troop, girt with alternate dies Of severall hue, which while a black doth fill The inward space ends in a solid quill. That lessening by degrees, doth in a while, Take a quick point, and sharpens to a Pile. Nor doth her squadrons like the hedg-hogs stand Fixt, but she darts them forth, and at command Farre off her members aims, shot through the skye From her shak'd side the Native Engines flye. Sometimes retiring, Parthian like, shee'l wound Her following foe, sometimes intrenching round, In battail form marshalling all her flanks, Shee'l clash her javelins to affright the ranks Of her poor enemies: lineing every side With spears to which she is her self allied, Each part of her's a souldier, from her back But stir'd, a horse a horrid noise doth crack, That one would think the trumpets did incite Two adverse Armies to begin to fight, So great a noise from one so small did rise, Then to her skill in Arms she is so wise As to add Policy, and a thrifty fear Of her own safety; she a wrath doth bear Not prodigall of weapons, but content With wary threatning, and hath seldome sent An arrow forth, caus'd by an idle strife, But spends 'em only to secure her life! And then her diligent stroke so certain is VVithout all errour, shee will seldome misse, No distance cozens her; the dumb skin aims right, And rules the levy of the skilfull sight. VVhat humane labour, though we boast it such, VVith all her reason can perform so much? They from the Cyetan Goats their horns must take, And after, those with fire must softer make. Bulls guts must bend their bows, and e're they fight Steel arms their darts, and feathers wing their flights. VVhen lo a little beast we armed see VVith nothing but her own Artilery: VVho seeks no forraign ayd, with her all go, She to her self is Quiver, darts, and bow. One Creature all the Arts of warfare knows; If from examples then the practise flows Of humane life, hence did th' Invention grow At distance to encounter with our foe. Hence the Cydonians instructed are Their stratagems and manner of their war. Hence did the Parthians learn to fight and fly, Taught by this bird their skilfull Archery. In Archimedis Sphæram, ex Claudiano. Iove saw the Heavens fram'd in a little glasse, And laughing, to the gods these words did passe: Comes then the power of mortall ears so far? In brittle Orbs my labours acted are. The statutes of the Poles, the fates of things, The laws of gods, this Syrasusian brings Hither by art: Spirits inclos'd attend Their severall sphears, and with set motions bend The living work: Each yeer the faigned Sun, Each month returns the counterfeited Moon, And viewing now her world, bold Industry Grows proud, to know the heavens her subjects be. Believe Salmonius hath false thunders thrown, For a poor hand is Natures rivall grown. De magnete, ex Claudiano. Who in the world with busie reason pries, Searching the seed of things, and there descries With what defect labours th' Eclipsed Moon, What cause commands a palenesse in the Sun, Whence ruddy Comets with their fatall hair, VVhence winds do slow, and what the Motions are That shake the bowels of the trembling Earth, VVhat strikes the lightning forth, whence clouds give birth To horrid thunders, and doth also know VVhat light lends lustre to the painted Bow: If ought of truth his soule doth understand, Let him resolve a question I'le demand. There is a stone which we the load-stone stile, Of colour ugly, dark, obscure, and vile: It never deck'd the sleiked locks of Kings, No Ornament, no gorgeous Tire it brings To virgins beauteous necks, it never shone A splendent buckle in their maiden Zone: But only hear the wonders I will tell, Of this black Peeble, and 'twill then excel All bracelets, and what e're the diving Moore 'Mongst the red weeds seeks for i'th Eastern shore: From Iron first it lives, Iron it eats, But that sweet feast it knows no other meats; Thence she renews her strength, vigor is sent Through all her nerves by that hard nourishment, VVithout that food she dies, a famine num's Her meager joynts, a thirst her veins consumes. Mars that frights Cities with his bloody sphears, And Venus that releases humane fears, Do both together in one Temple shine, Both joyntly honour'd in a common shrine; But different Statues, Mars a steel put on, And Venus figure was Magnetique stone. To them (as is the custome every yeer) The Priest doth celebrate a Nuptiall there. The torch the Quire doth lead, the threshold's green VTith hallowed Mirtles, and the beds are seen To smell with rosie flowers, the Geniall sheet Spread over with a purple Coverlet. But here (O strange!) the statues seem'd to move, And Cytheria runs to catch her Love: And like their former joyes in heaven possest, With wanton heat clings to her Mars's brest; There hangs a gratefull burden: then she throws Her arms about his helmet, to inclose Her Love in amorous Gives, lest he get our, Her live embraces chain him round about. He stird'd with love, breath'd gently through his veins, Is drawn by unseen links, and secret chains, To meet his spoused Gem; the ayr doth wed The steel unto the stone thus strangely led The deities their stoln delights replay'd, And onely Nature was the bridall-maid. What heat in these two metals did inspire Such mutuall league? what concords powerfull fire Contracted their hard minds? the stone doth move With amorous heat, the steel doth learn to love. So Venus oft the god of War withstood, And gives him milder looks; when hot with blood He rages to the fight, fierce with desire, And with drawn points whets up his active ire; She dares go forth alone, and boldly meet His foaming steeds, and with a winning greet The tumour of his high swoln brest asswage, Tempring with gentle flames his violent rage. Peace courts his soule, the fight he disavows, And his red plumes he now to kisses bows. Ah cruell boy, large thy dominions be, The gods and all their thunders yeeld to thee, Great jove to leave his heaven thou canst constrain, And midst the brinish waves to Love again. Now the cold Rocks thou strik'st, the senselesse stone, Thy weapon feels; a lustfull heat doth run Through veins of flint; the steel thy power can tame, And rigid Marble must admit thy flame. De Sene Veronensi: Ex Claudiano. Happy man that all his dayes hath spent VVithin his own grounds, and no farther went; VVhom the same house that did him erst behold A little Infant, sees him now grown old; That with his staffe walks where he crawl'd before, Counts th'age of one poor cottage and no more. Fortune ne're him with various tumult prest, Nor drank he unknown streams, a wandring guest. He fear'd no Merchants storms, nor drums of war, Nor ever knew the strifes of the hoarse Bar. VVho though to th'next Town he a stranger be, Yet heavens sweet prospect he enjoys more free. From fruits, not Consuls, computation brings, By Apples Autumns knows, by flowers the springs. Thus he the day by his own orb doth prize; In the same field his Sun doth set and rise. That knew an oak a twig, and walking thither Beholds a wood and he grown up together, Neighbouring Veron he may for India take, And think the red Sea is Benacus lake. Yet is his strength untam'd, and firm his knees; Him the third age a lusty Grandsire sees. Go seek who's will the far Ibrean shore, This man hath liv'd, though that hath travel'd more. The second. Epod. of Horace translated. Happy the man which farre from city care, (Such as ancient Mortals were) VVith his own oxen plows his fathers land, Free from Usurers griping hand. The souldiers trumpets never break his sleep, Nor angry seas that raging keep He shuns the wrangling Hall, nor foot doth set On the proud thresholds of the Great: His life is this (O life almost divine!) To marry Elmes unto the Vine; To prune unfruitfull branches, and for them To graft a bough of happier stem. Or else within the low couch'd vallies views His well cloath'd flocks of bleating ews. Sometimes his honey he in pots doth keep, Sometimes he shears his fleecy sheep. And when his fruits with Autumn ripened be, Gathers his Apples from the tree. And joyes to tast the Pears himself did plant, And Grapes that naught of purple want. Under an Oak sometimes he layes his head, Making the tender grasse his bed. Mean while the streams along their banks do float, And birds do chaunt with warbling throat, And gentle springs a gentle murmure keep, To lull him to a quiet sleep. When winter comes, and th'ayre doth chiller grow, Threatning showers, and shivering snow, Either with hounds he hunts the tusked swine That foe unto the corn and vine; Or layes his nets, or limes the unctious bush To catch the black-bird, or the thrush. Sometimes the Hare he courses, and one way Makes both a pleasure and a prey. But if with him a modest wife doth meet, To guide his house and children sweet, Such as the Sabine or Apulean wife, Something brown, but chast of life; Such as will make a good warm fire to burn, Against her wearied Mate's return, And shutting in her stalls her fruitfull Neat, Will make the kines distended Teats Fetching her husband of her self-brewd beer, And other wholsome Countrey cheer. Sup him with bread and cheese, Pudding or bye, Such dainties as they do not any: Give me but these, and I shall never care VVhere all the Lucrine Oisters are, These wholsome Country dainties shall to me Sweet as Tench or Sturgeon be. Had I but these, I well could be without The Carp, the Sammon, or the Traut: Nor should the Phænix selfe so much delight My not ambitions appetite, As should an Apple snatch'd from mine own trees Or honey of my labouring Bees. My Cattels udders should afford me food, My sheep my cloath, my ground my wood, Sometimes a lamb, snatch'd from the wolf shall be A banquet for my friend and me. Sometimes a Calf, ta'en from the lowing Cow, Or tender Issue of the Sow. Our gardens sallets yeeld, Mallows to keep Loose bodies, Lettice for to sleep. The cackliog Hen an egg for breakfast layes, And Duck that in our water playes. The Goose for us her tender plumes hath bred, To lay us on a softer bed. Our blankets are not dy'd with Orphans tears, Our pillows are not stuff'd with cares. To walk on our own ground a stomack gets, The best of sauce to cure our meats. In midst of such a feast 'tis joy to come And seel the well-fed Lambs at home. 'Tis pleasure to behold th'inversed Plow, The Languid necks of Oxen bow. And view th'industrious servants that will sweat Both at labour and at meat. Lord grant me but enough; I aske no more, Then will serve mine, and help the poore. An Elegy upon the Lady Venetian Digby. Death, whol'd not change prerogatives with thee That dost such rapes, yet maist not question'd be? Here cease thy wanton lust, be satisfi'd, Hope not a second, and so fair a bride. Where was her Mars, whose valiant arms did hold This Venus once, that thou durst be so bold By thy too nimble theft? I know 'twas fear, Lest he should come, that would have rescued her. Monster confesse, didst thou not blushing stand, And thy pale cheek turnd red to touch her hand? Did she not lightning like strike sudden heat Through thy cold limbs, and thaw thy frost to sweat? Well since thou hast her, use her kindly, Death, And in requitall of such preious breath Watch sentinell to guard her, do not see The worms thy rivals, for the gods will be. Remember Paris, for whose pettier sin, The Troian gates let the stout Grecian in: So when time ceases, (whose unthrifty hand Ha's now almost consum'd his stock of sand) Myriads of Angels shall in Armies come, And fetch (proud ravisher) their Helen home. And to revenge this rape, thy other store Thou shalt resign too, and shalt steal no more, Till then fair Ladies (for you now are fair, But till her death I fear'd your just despair,) Fetch all the spiees that Arabia yeelds, Distill the choysest flowers of the fields? And when in one their best perfections meet Embalm nor course that she may make them sweet. Whilst for an Epitaph upon her stone I cannot write, but I must weep her one. Epitaph. Beauty it self lies here, in whom alone, Each part enjoy'd the same perfection. In some the eyes we praise, in some the hair; In her the lips, in her the cheeks are fair; That Nymphs fine feet; her hands we beauteous call; But in this form we praise no part, but all. The ages past have many beauties shown, And I more plenty in our time have known: But in the age to come I look for none; Nature despairs because the pattern's gone, An Epitaph upon Mrs. J. T. Reader, if thou hast a tear, Thou canst not choose but pay it here, Here lies modesty, meeknesse, zeale, Goodnesse, Piety, and to tell Her worth at once, one that had shown All vertues that her sex could own, Nor dare my praise too lavish be, Lest her dust blush, for so would she. Hast thou beheld in the spring's bowers Tender buds break to bring forth flowers? So to keep vertues stock, pale death Took her to give her infant breath, Thus her accounts were all made even, She robb'd not earth, to add to heaven. An Epithalamium. Muse be a bride-maide? dost not heare How honoured Hunt, and his fair Deer, This day prepare her wedding cheer? The swiftest of thy pinions take, And hence a sudden journey make, To help 'em break their bridall Cake. Hast'em to Church, tell 'em love sayes, Religion breeds but fond delayes, To lengthen but the tedious dayes. Chide the slow Priest, that so goes on, As if he feard he should have done His Sermon, e're the glasse be run. Bid him post o're his words, as fast As if himself were now to tast The pleasure of so fair a wast. Now lead the blessed Couple home, And serve a dinner up for some, Their banquet is as yet to come. Maids dance as nimbly as your blood, VVhich I see swell a purple flood In emulation of that good The Bride possesseth; for I deeme VVhat she enjoyes will be the theme This night of every virgins dream. But envy not their blest content, The hasty night is almost spent, And they of Cupid will be shent. The Sun is now ready to ride, Sure 'twas the morning I espide, Or 'twas the blushing of the Bride. See how the lusty bridegrooms veins Swell, till the active torrent strains To break those o're-stretcht azure chains. And the fair bride ready to cry To see her pleasant losse so nigh, Pants like the scaled Pigeons eye. Put out the torch, Love loves no lights, Those that perform their mistick rites Must pay their Orisons by nights. Nor can that sacrifice be done By any Priest, or Nun alone, But when they both are met in one. Now you that tast of Hymens cheer, See that your lips do meet so neer, That Cockles might be tutor'd there. And let the whisperings of your love Such short and gentle murmurs prove, As they were Lectures to the dove. And in such strict embraces twine, As if you read unto the Vine, The Ivy and the Columbine. Then let your mutuall bosoms beat, Till they create by virtuall heat Mirrhe, Balme, and Spikenard in a sweat. Thence may there spring many a pair Of Sons and Daughters strong and fair: How soon the gods have heard my prair! Methinks already I espy The cradles rock, the babies cry, And drowsie Nurses Lullaby. An Epitaph upon his honoured friend Mr. War. Here lies the knowing head, the honest heart, Fair blood, and courteous hands, and every part Of gentle Warre, all with one stone content, Though each deserv'd a severall monument. He was (believe me Reader) for 'tis rare Vertuous though young, and learned though an heir. Not with his Blood, or Natures gifts content, He paid them both their tribute which they lent. His Ancestors in him fixed their pride, So with him all reviv'd, with him all dyed. This made death lingring come, asham'd to be, At once the ruine of a family. Learn Reader here, though long thy line hath stood, Time breeds consumptions in the noblest blood. Learn (Reader) here to what our Glories come, Here's no distinction 'twixe the House and Tomb, Upon the losse of his little finger. Arithmetique nine digits, and no more Admits of, then I still have all my store, For what mischance hath tane from my left hand, It seems did only for a cypher stand, But this I'le say for thee departed joynt, Thou wert not given to steal, to pick, nor point At any in disgrace, but thou didst go Untimely to thy Deeth, only to show The other members what they once must do. Hand arm, leg, thigh, and all must follow tool Oft didst thou scan my verse, where if I misse Henceforth I will impute the cause to this. A fingers losse (I speak it not in sport) VVill make a verse a Foot too short, Farewell dear finger, much I grieve to see How soon mischanse hath made a hand of thee. On the Passion of Christ What rends the temples vail, where is day gone? How can a generall darknesse cloud the Sun? Astrologers their skill in vain do try, Nature must needs be sick, when, God can dye. Necessary Observations. 1 Precept.

Pre. Thank those that do thee good, so shalt thou gain Their second help, if thou shouldst need again, 12. Pre. To doubtfull matters do not headlong run; What's well left off, were better not begun. 13. Pre. Be well advis'd, and wary counsell make, E're thou dost any action undertake, Having undertaken, thy indeavours bend To bring thy Action to a perfect end. 14. Pre. Safe in thy brest close lock up thy Intents, For he that knows thy purpose, best prevents. 15. Pre. To tell thy miseries will no comfort breed. Men help thee most that think thou hast no need. But if the world once thy misfortunes know, Thou soon shalt loose a friend, and finde a foe. 16. Pre. Keep thy friends goods, for should thy wants be known Thou canst not tell but they may be thy own. 17. Pre. To gather wealth through fraud do not presume, A little evill got will much consume. 18. Pre. First think, and if thy thoughts approve thy will Then speak, and after what thou speakst fulfill. 19. Pre. Spare not, nor spend to much; be this thy care, Spare but to spend, and onely spend to spare. Who spends too much may want, and so complain, But he spends best that spares to spend again. 20. Pre. Jf with a stranger thou discourse, first learn By strictest observations to discern, If he be wiser then thy self; if so Be dumb, and rather choose by him to know: But if thy self perchance the wiser be, Then do thou speak that he may learn by thee. 21. Pre. If thou dispraise a man let no man know, By any circumstance that he's thy foe: If men but once finde that, they'l quickly see Thy words from hate, and not from judgement be. If thou wouldst tell his vice, do what you can To make the world believe thou lov'st the man. 22. Pre. Reprove not in their wrath incensed men, Good councel comes clean out of season then. But when his fury is appeas'd and past, He will conceive his fault and mend at last. When he is cool and calm, then utter it, No man gives Physick in the midst oth' Fit, 23. Pre. Seem not too conscious of thy worth, nor be The first that knows thy own sufficiency. If to thy King and Countrey thy true care More serviceable is then others are, That blaze in Court; and every action sway As if the Kingdom on their shoulders lay. Or if thou serv'st a master, and dost see Others prefer'd of lesse Desert then thee. Do not complain, though such a plaint be true, Lords will not give their Favours as a due, But rather stay and hope: it cannot be But men at last must needs thy vertues see. So shall thy trust endure and greater grow, Whil'st they that are above thee, fall below. 24. Pre. Desire not thy mean fortunes for to set Next to the estately Manners of the Great. He will suspect thy labours, and oppresse, Fearing thy greatnesse makes his wealth the lesse. Great ones do love no equals: But must be Above the Terms of all comparity. Such a rich neighbour is compared best To the great Pike that eats up all the rest: Or else like Pharaohs Cow, that in an hour VVill seven of his fattest friends devour. Or like the sea whose vastnesse swallows clean All other streams, though no increase be seen. Live by the Poor, they do the Poor no harm; So Bees thrive best when they together swarm. Rich men are Bears, and Poor men ought to fear'em Like ravenous wolves, 'tis dangerous living near'em. 25. Pre. Each man three Devils hath; self born affliction, Th'unruly Tongue, the Belly, and Affections: Charme these, such holy Conjurations can Gain thee a frienship both of God and man. 26. Pre. So live with man, as if Gods curious Eye, Did every where into thine Actions prye. For never yet was sin so void of sence, So fully fac'd with brazen impudence. As that it durst before mens eyes commit Their beastly lusts, lest they should witnesse it. How dare they then offend, when God shall see, That must alone both Iudge and jury be? 27, Pre. Take thou no care how to defer thy death, And give more respite to this Mortall breath. Would'st thou live long? the onely means are these, 'Bove Galens dyet or Hypocrates. Strive to live well, tread in the upright wayes, And rather count thy Actions then thy dayes; Then thou hast liv'd enough amongst us here, For every day well spent I count a year. Live well, and then how soon so e're thou dye, Thou art of Age to claim Eternity. But he that out lives Nestor, and appears T'have past the date of grave Methusalem's years; If he his life to sloth and sin doth give, I say he onely Was, he did not Live. 28. Pre. Trust not a man unknown, he may deceive thee; And doubt the man thou know'st, for he may leave thee. And yet for to prevent exception too, 'Tis best not seem to doubt although you do. 29. Pre. Hear much but little speak, a wise man fears, And will not use his tongue so much as ears. The Tongue if it the hedge of Teeth do break Will others shame, and its own Ruin speak. I never yet did ever read of any Undone by hearing, but by speaking many. The reason's this, the Ears if chast and holly, Do let in wit, the Tongue doth let out folly. 30. Pre. To all alike be courteous, meek, and kinde, A win ning carriage with indifferent minde. But not familiar, that must be exempt, Grooms saucy love soon turns into contempt, Be sure he be at least as good as thee, To whom thy friendship shall familiar be. 31. Pre. Iudge not between two friends, but rather see If thou canst bring them friendly to agree. So shalt thou both their Loves to thee increase, And gain a blessing too for makig Peace, But if thou shouldst decide the cause 'ith'end, How e're thou judge thou sure shalt lose a friend. 32. Pre. Thy credit wary keep, 'tis quickly gone; Being got by many Actions, lost by one. 33. Pre. Unto thy Brother buy not, sell, nor lend, Such Actions have their own peculiar end; But rather chuse to give him, if thou see That thou hast power, and he necessity. 34. Pre. Spare in thy youth, lest Age should finde thee poor When time is past, and thou canst spare no more. No coupl'd misery is so great in either, As Age and VVant when both do meet together. 35. Pre. Fly Drunkennesse, whose vile incontinence Takes both away the reason and the sence. Till with Ciræ an Kups thy mind's possest Leaves to be man, and wholly turns a Beast. Think whilst thou swallowest the capacious Bowle, Thou let'st in Seas to wrack and drown the soule. That hell is open, to remembrance call, And think how subject drunkards are to fall. Consider how it soon destroyes the grace Of humane shape, spoiling the beauteous face: Puffing the cheeks, blearing the curious eye, Studding the face with vitious Heraldry. What Pearls and Rubies doth the wine disclose, Making the purse poor to enrich the Nose? How does it nurse disease, infect the heart, Drawing some sicknesse into every part! The Stomack over-cloy'd, wanting a vent, Doth up againe resend her excrement. And then (ô see what too much wine can do!) The very soul being drunk spews secrets too. The Lungs corrupted breath contagious ayr, Belching up fumes that unconcocted are, The brain o're warm'd (losing her sweet repose) Doth purge her filthy ordure through the nose, The veins do boyl glutted with vitious food, And quickly fevers the distemper'd blood. The belly swels, the foot can hardly stand Lam'd with the Gout; the Palsie shakes the Hand. And through the flesh sick waters sinking in, Do Bladder-like puffe up the dropsi'd skin. It weaks the Brain, it spoils the Memory, Hasting on Age, and wilful Poverty. It drowns thy better parts, making thy name To foes a laughter, to thy friends a shame. 'Tis vertues poyson, and the bane of rrust, The match of wrath, the fuel unto lust. Quite leave this vice, and turn not to't again, Upon presumption of a stronger brain. For he that holds more wine then others can, I rather count a Hogs-head then a man. 36. Pre. Let not thy impotent lust so powerfull be Over thy Reason, Soul, and Liberty. As to enforce thee to a married life, Er'e thou art able to maintain a wife. Thou canst not feed upon her lips and face, She cannot cloath thee with a poor imbrace, My self being yet alone, and but one still, With patience could endure the worst of ill. VVhen fortune frowns, one to the wars may go To fight against his foes, and fortunes too. But (ô) the grief were treble for to see Thy wretched Bride half pin'd with Poverty. To see thy infants make their dumb complaint, And thou not able to relieve their want. The poorest beggar when he's dead and gone, Is rich as he that sits upon the Throne, But he that having no estate is wed, Starves in his grave, being wretched when he's dead. 37. Pre. If e're I take a wife, I will have one Neither for beauty nor for portion, But for her vertues; and I'le married be Not for my lust, but for posterity. And when I am wed, I'le never jealous be, But make her learn how to be chast by me. And be her face what t'will, I'le think her faire If she within the house confine her care. If modest in her words, and cloaths she be, Not dawb'd with pride, and prodigality; If with her neighbours she maintains no strife, And beare her self to be a faithfull wife; I'de rather unto such a one be wed, Then clasp the choysest Helen in my bed. Yet though she were an Angell, my affection Should onely love, not dote on her perfection. A Platonik Eligie. Love, give me leave to serve thee, and be wise To keep thy torch in, but restore blinde eyes. I will a flame into my bosome take, That Martyrs Court when they embrace the stake: Not dull, and smoaky fires, but heat divine, That burns not to consume, but to refine. I have a Mistresse for perfections rare In every eye, but in my thoughts most fair. Like Tapers on the Altar shine her eyes; Her breath is the perfume of Sacrifice. And whereso'ere my fancy would begin, Still her perfection lets Religion in, I touch her like my Beads, with devout care, And come unto my Court-ship as my Prayer. VVe sit, and talk, and kisse away the houres As chastly as the morning dews kisse flowers. Go wanton Lover, spare thy sighs and tears, Put on the Livery which thy dotage wears, And call it Love, where heresie gets in Zeal's but a coal to kindle greater sin. VVe wear no flesh, but one another greet. As blessed souls in separation meet. Wer't possible that my ambitious sin, Durst commit rapes upon a Cherubin, I might have lust full thought? to her, of all Earths heav'nly Quire the most Angelicall. Looking into my breast, her form I finde That like my Guardian-Angells keeps my minde From rude attempts; and when affections stir, I calm all passions with one thought of her. Thus they whose reasons love, and not their sence, The Spirits love: thus one Intelligence Reflects upon his like, and by chast loves In the same sphear this and that Angell moves. Nor is this barren Love; one noble thought Begets another, and that still is brought To bed of more; Vertues and grace increase, And such a numerous issue ne're can cease, VVhere Children though great blessings, onely be Pleasures repriv'd to some posterity. Beasts love like men, if men in lust delight, And call that Love which is but appetite. When essence meets with essence, and souls joyn In mutual knots, that's the true Nuptial twine: Such, Lady, is my Love, and such is true. All other Love is to your Sex, not You. An Apologie for his false Prediction that his Aunt Lane would be deliver'd of a Son. ?? ??? ??????? ?? ??? ?? ????? ?????? The best Prophets are but good Guessers. Are then the Sybils dead? what is become Of the loud Oracles? are the Agures dumb? Live not the Magi that so oft reveal'd Natures intents? his Gipsisme quite repeal'd? In Fryar Bacon nothing but a name? Or is all Witchcraft brain'd with Doctor Lamb? Does not the learned Bungies soul inherit? Has Madam Davers dispossest her spirit? Or will the VVelchmen give me leave to say There is no faith in Merlin? none though they Daresware each letter Creed, and pawn their blood He prophesied an age before the flood Of holy Deo, which was as some have said, Ten generations ere the Ark was made. All your perdictions, but impostures are, And you but prophecy of things that were. And you Cœlestial juglars that pretend You are acquainted with the stars, and send Your spyes to search what's done in every sphear, Keeping your State-intelligencers there; Your art is all deceit, for now I see Against the Rules of deep Astrology, Girls may be got when Mars his power doth vaunt, And Boyes when Venus is Predominant. Nor doth the Moon though moist and cold she be Alwayes at full, work to produce the she: Had this been true I had foretold no lye, It was the Art was in the wrong, not I. Thence I so dully err'd in my belief, As to mistake an Adam for an Eve: O grosse mistake, and in the civill pleas Error personæ, Master Doctor saies, And may admit divorce, but farwell now You hungry star-fed Tribe, henceforth I vow Talmud, Albumazar, and Ptolomie, VVith Erra Pater shall no Gospel be. Nor will I ever after this! swear Through Dice upon the shepherds Calender. But why do I t'excuse my ignorance Lay blame upon the Art? no, no, perchance I have lost all my skill, for well I know My Physiognomy two years ago By the small Pox was mar'd, and it may be A fingers losse hath spoild my Palmistry. But why should I a grosse mistake confesse? No, I am confident I did but guesse The very truth; it was a male-childe then, But Aunt you staid till 'twas a wench agen. To see th'unconstancy of humane things, How little time great Alteration brings! All things are subject unto change we know, And if all things, then why not sexes too? Teresias we read a man was born Yet after did into a woman turn, Lovinus a Physitian of great fame, Reports that one at Paris did the same. And devout Papists say certain it is, One of their Popes by Metamorphosis Indur'd the same, else how could Ioan be heir To the succession of Saint Peters Chair. So I at Chairing Crosse have beheld one A Statue cut out of the Parian stone To figure great Alcides: which when well The Artist saw it was not like to sell, He takes his Chizell, and away he pares Part of his sinewy neck; shaving the haires Of his rough beard and face, smoothing the brow And making that look amorous, which but now Stood wrinkled with his anger; from his head He poles the shaggy locks, and had o're spread His brawny shoulders with a fleece of haire, And works instead more gentle tresses there; And thus his skill exactly to expresse, Soon makes a Venus of an Hercules. And can it then impossible appear, That such a change as this might happen here. For this cause therefore (gentle Aunt) I pray Blame not my Prophecy, but your delay. But this will not excuse me; that I may Directly clear my self, there is no way Unlesse the Jesuites will to me impart The secret depth of their mysterious art. Who from their halting Patriot learn to frame A Crutch for every word that fals out lame. That can the subtile difference descry Betwixt æquivocation and a lye. And a rare scape by sly distinction finde To swear the Tongue, and yet not swear the minde. Now arm'd with Arguments I nothing dread, But my own cause thus confidently plead. I said there was a boy within your womb, Not actually, but one in time to come. Or by Antiphrasis my words might be That ever understands the contrary: Or when I said you should a man-childe bear, You understood me of the sex I fear, When I did mean the minde; and thus define A woman but of spirit masculine. Or had I said it should a girl have been And it had prov'd a boy, you should have seen Me solve it thus; I meant a boy by fate But one that would have been effeminate. Or thus I had my just excuse begun, I said my Aunt would surely bring a son If not a daughter; what we seers foresee Is certain truth, unlesse it falshood be. Or I affirm because she brought forth one That will bring boyes, she hath brought forth a son: For do not we call Father Adam thus, Because that he got those that have got us. VVhatere I said by simple Affirmation, I meant the right by mental reservation. An Epithalamium to Mr. F. H. Franke when this Morne the harbinger of day Blush't from her Eastern pillow where she lay Clasp'd in her Pthons arms, red with those kisses Which being injoy'd by night, by day she misses: I walk'd the fields to see the teeming earth, VVhose womb now swels to give the flowers a birth VVhere while my thoughts with every object tane, In several contemplations wrapt my brain. A sudden lustre like the Sun did rise, And with too great a light eclips'd mine eyes. At last I spyed a Beauty, such another, As I have sometimes heard call thee her brother. But by the chariot, and her team of Doves, I guesse her to be Venus, Queen of Loves, VVith her a pretty boy I there did see, But for his wings I had thought it had been thee. At last when I beheld his quiver of darts, I knew t'was Cupid Emperour of our hearts. Thus I accosted them. Goddesse divine, Great Queen of Paphos, and Cytherian shrine: Whose Altars no man sees that can depart Till in those flames he sacrifice his heart; That conquer'st gods, and men, and heaven divine, Yea, and hell too: Bear witnesse Proserpine. And Cupid, thou that canst thy Trophies show Over all these, and o're thy mother too; Witnesse the night which when with Mars she lay, Did all her sports to all the gods betray: Tell me great Powers, what makes such glorious beams Visit the lowly banks of Ninus streams? Then Venus smil'd, and smiling bid me know Cupid and she must both to Weston go. I guesse the cause; for Hymen came behinde In saffron robes, his Nuptiall knots to binde, Then thus I pray'd: Great Venus by the Love Of thy Adonis; as thou hop'st to move Thy Mars to second kisses, and obtain Beauties reward, the Golden fruit again: Bow thy fair ears to my chast prayers, and take Such Orisons as purest Love can make. Thou, and thy boy I know are posting thither To tye pure hearts in purest bonds together. Cupid thou know'st the maid, I have seen thee lye VVith all thy arrows lurking in her eye. Venus thou know'st her love, for I have seen The time thou would'st have fain her Rivall been. O blesse then both! let their affections meet VVith happy Omens in the Geniall sheet. Both comely, beauteous both, both equal fair, Thou canst not glory in a fitter pair. I would not thus have prayed if I had seen Fourscore and ten, wed to a young fifteen. Death in such Nuptials seems with love to play, And January seems to match with May. Autumn to wed the Spring, Frost to desire To kisse the Sun, Ice to embrace the fire, Both these are young, both spritfull, both compleat, Of equal moysture, and of equal heat: And their desires are one; were all Loves such VVho would love solitary sheets so much? Virginity (whereof chast fools do boast; A thing not known what, 'tis, till it be lost) Let others praise, for me I cannot tell VVhat vertue 'tis to lead Baboons in hell. VVoman is one with man when she is brided; The same in kinde, onely in sex divided. Had all dy'd maids, we had been nothing then; Adam had been the first, and last of men. How none O Venus then thy power had seen? How then in vain had Cupids arrows been? My self whose cool thoughts feel no hot desires, That setve not Venus flames but Vesta's fires: Had I not vow'd the Cloysters, to confine My self to no more wives then onely Nine, Parnassus brood, those that hear Phœbus sing, Bathing their naked limbs in Thespian spring, I'de rather be an Owl of Birds, then one That is the Phœnix if she live alone. Two's the first of numbers, one naught can do, One then is good, when one is made of two. VVhich mystery is thine great Venus, thine, Thy union can two souls in one combine. Now by that power I charge thee blesse the sheets VVith happy issue where this couple meets. The maid's a Harvy, one that may compare VVith fruit Hesperian, or the Dragones care. Her Love a ward, not he that awed the seas: Frighting the fearfull Hamadriades, That Ocean terrour, he that durst out brave Dread Neptunes Trident. Amphitrites wave, This Ward a milder Pirat sure will prove, And onely sails the Hellespont of Love. As once Leander did: his theft is best That nothing steals but what's within the brest. Yet let that other Ward his thefts compare, And ransack all his treasures, let him beare The wealth of worlds, the bowels of the West, And all the richest treasures of the Last. The sands of Tagus, all Pactolus Ore, With both the Indies; yet this one gets more At once by Love, then he by force could get, Or ravish from the Marchants, let him set His Ores together; let him vainly boast Of spices snatch'd from the Canary coast, The Gums of Egypt, or the Tyrian fleece Dyed in his Native purple, with what Greece, Colchos, Arabia, or proud China yeelds, With all the Metals in Guina fields. When this has set all forth to boast his pride In various pomp, this other brings his Bride, And I'le be judg'd by all judicious eyes, If she alone prove not the richer prize. O let not death have power their Love to severe! Let them both love, and live, and dye together, O let their beds be chast, and banish thence As well all Iealousies, as all offence! For some men I have known, whose wives have been As chast as Ice: such as were never seen In wanton dalliance, such as untill death Never smelt any, but their husbands breath. Yet the Good-man still dream'd of horns, still fearing His forehead would grow harder; still appearing To his own fancy, Bull, or Stag, or more, Or Ox at least, that was an Asse before. If she would have new cloathes, he strait will fear She loves a Taylor; if she sad appear He guesses soon it is 'cause he's at home; If jocand, sure she has some friend to come, If she be sick, he thinks no grief she felt, But wishes all Physitians had been guelt, But ask her how she does, sets him a swearing, Feeling her pulse, is love-tricks past the bearing. Poor wretched wife, she cannot look a wry But without doubt, 'tis flat adultery. And jealous wives there be, that are afraid To entertain a handsome Chamber-maid, Far, far from them be all such thoughts I pray, Let their Loves prove eternal, and no day Adde date to their affections, (grant O Queen) Their Love like Nuptial-bayes be alwayes green. And also grant—but here she bid me stay, For well she knew what I had else to say. I ask'd no more, wish'd her hold on her race To joyne their hands and send them night apace. She smil'd to hear what I in sport did say, So whip'd her doves and smiling rid away. To M. Feltham on his booke of Resolves. In this unconstant Age when all mens mindes In various change strive to outvie the windes. VVhen no man sets his foot upon the square, But treads on globes and circles; when we are The Apes of fortune, and desire to be Resolved on as fickle wheels as she. As if the Plannets that our rulers are, Made the souls motion too irregular. When minds chang ofther then the Greek could dream, That made the Metempseucos'd soul his theam. Yea oft to beastly forms: when truth to say, Moons chang but once a Month, we twice a day. VVhen none resolves but to be rich, and ill; Or else resolves to be irresolute still. In such a tide of mindes, that every hour Do ebb and flow, by what inspiring power, By what instinct of grace I cannot tell, Dost thou resolve so much, and yet so well? While foolish men whose reason is their sence, Still wandring in the worlds circumference: Though holding passions reins with strictest hand Dost firm and fixed in the Center stand. Thence thou art setled, other-while they tend To rove about the circle finde no end. Thy book I read, and read it with delight, Resolving so to live as thou dost write. And yet I guesse thy life thy book produces, And but expresses thy peculiar uses. Thy manners dictate, thence thy writing came, So Lesbians by their works their rules do frame. Not by the rules the work: thy life had been Pattern enough, had it at all been seen, Without a book? books make the difference here, In them thou liv'st the same but every where. And this I guesse, though th'art unknown to me, By thy chast writing; else it could not be (Dissemble ne're so well) but here and there Some tokens of that plague would soon appear; Oft lurking in the skin a secret gout In books would sometimes blister, and break out. Contagious sins in which men take delight Must needs infect the paper when they write. But let the curious eyes of Lynceus look Through every nerve, and sinew of this book, Of which 'tis full: let the most diligent minde Pry thorow it, each sentence he shall finde. Season'd with chaste, not with an itching salt, More savouring of the Lamp then of the male. But now too many think no wit divine, Non worthy life, but whose luxurious line Can ravish Virgins thoughts; And is it fit To make a Pander, or a Baud of wit? But tell'em of it, in contempt they look, And ask in scorn if you would geld the book. As if th'effeminite brain could nothing do That should be chaste, and yet be masculine too. Such books as these (as they themselves indeed Truly confesse) men do not praise but read. Such idle books, which it perchance they can Better the brain, yet they corrupt the man. Thou hast not one bad line so lustfull bred, As to die maid, or matrons cheek in red. Thy modest wit, and witty honest letter Make both at once my wit, and me the better. Thy book a garden is, and helps us most To regain that, which we in Adam lost. Where on the tree of knowledge we may feed, But such as no forbidden fruits doth breed. Whose leaves like those whence Eve her coat did frame, Serve not to cover, but to cure our shame. Fraught with all flowers, not onely such as grows To please the eye, or to delight the nose. But such as may redeem lost healths again, And store of Hellebore to purge the brain. Such as would cure the surfeit man did take From Adams Apples, such as fain would make Mans second Paradise, in which should be The fruits of life, but no forbidden Tree. It is a garden; ha, I thus did say: And maids, and Matrons blushing run away. But maids re-enter these chast pleasing bowers, Chast Matrons here gather the purest flowers. Fear not, from this pure Garden do not flye. In it doth no obscence Pryapus lye. This is an Eden where no serpents be To tempt the womans imbecility. These lines rich sap the fruit to heaven doth raise; Nor doth the Cinnamon-bark deserve lesse praise, I mean the stile, being pure, and strong, and round, Not long, but Pithy: being short breath'd, but sound. Such as the grave, [illeg.]cute, wise Seneca sings, The best of Tutours to the worst of Kings. Not long and empty; lofty but not proud; Subtile but sweet, high but without a cloud. Well setled, full of nerves, in brief 'tis such That in a little hath comprized much. Like th'Iliads in a Nutshel. And I say Thus much for stile; though truth should not be gay In strumpets glittering robes, yet ne're the lesse She well deserves a Matrons comlinesse. Being too brave she would our fancies glut, But we should loath her being too much the slut, The reasonable soul from heaven obtain'd The best of bodies; and that man hath gain'd A double praise, whose noble vertues are Like to the face, in soul and body faire. Who then could have a nobler sentence clad In russet-thread-bare words, is full as mad As if Apelles should so fondly dote, As to paint Venus in old Baucys coat. They erre that would bring stile so basely under; The lofty language of the Law was thunder. The wisest 'pothecary knows 'tis skill Neatly to candy o're the wholesome pill. Best Physick then, when gaul with suger meets, Tempring Absinthian bitternesse with sweets. Such is thy sentence, such thy stile, being read Men see them both together happ'ly wed, And so resolve to keep them wed, as we Resolve to give them to posterity. 'Mongst thy resolves put my resolves in too; Resolve whose will, thus I resolve to do: That should my errours chuse anothers line Whereby to write, I mean to live by thine. In Natalem Augustissimi Principis Caroli. The original Latin verse has been omitted here. The first birth Mary was unto a tombe, And sad Lucina cheated thy blest wombe. To heav'n thou wert fruitful, now to earth, That canst give Saints as well as Kings a birth. Upon his Picture. When age hath made me what I am not now: And every wrinkle tells me where the plow. Of time hath furrowed; when an Ice shall flow Through every vein, and all my head be snow: When death displayes his coldnesse in my cheek, And I, my self in my own Picture seek, Not finding what I am, but what I was; In doubt which to beleeve, this, or my glasse: Yet though I alter, this remains the same As it was drawn, retains the primitive frame, And first complexion; here will still be seen Blood on the cheek, and down upon the chin. Here the smooth brow will stay, the lively eye, The ruddy Lip, and hair of youthfull dye. Behold what frailty we in man may see. Whose shadow is lesse given to change then he. An Ode to M. Anthony Stafford to hasten him into the Country. Come spurre away, I have no patience for a longer stay; But must go down, And leave the chargeable noise of this great Town. I will the Countrey see, Where old simplicity. Though hid in gray, Doth look more gay Then fopery in plush and scarlet clad. Farwell you Cirty-wits that are Almost at Civill-warre: 'Tis time that I grow wise, when all the world grows mad More of my dayes I will not spend to gain an Idiots praise; Or to make sport For some slight Puny of the Innes of Court. Then worthy Stafford, say, How shall we spend the day, With what delights, Shorten the nights? When from this tumult we are got secure; Where mirth with all her freedom goes, Yet shall no finger lose; Where every word is thought, and every thought is pure, There from the tree Wee'l cherries pluck, and pick the strawberry. And every day Go see the wholsome Countrey Girls make hay. Whose brown hath lovelier grace, Then any painted face, That I do know Hide-Parke can show. Where I had rather gain a kisse then meet (Though some of them in greater state Might court my love with plate) The beauties of the Cheap, and wives of Lumbardstreet. But think upon Some other pleasures, these to me are none, Why do I prate Of women, that are things against my fate. I never mean to wed That torture to my bed. My Muse is she My love shall be. Let Clowns get wealth, and heirs; when I am gone, And the great Bugbear, grisly death Shall take this idle breath. If I a Poem leave, that Poem is my Son. Of this no more; Wee'l rather tast the bright Pomono's store. No fruit shall scape Our pallats, from the damsen, to the grape, Then full wee'l seek a shade, And hear what musiques made: How Phylomell Her tale doth tell: And how the other Birds do fill the quire; The Thrush and Black-birds lend their throats Warbling melodious notes; We will all sports enjoy, which others but desire. Ours is the skye. Whereat what fowl we please out Hauk shall flye; Nor will we spare To hunt the crafty Fox, or timorous Hare; But let our hounds run loose In any ground they'l choose, The Buck shall fall The Stag and all: Our pleasures must from their own warrants be, For to my Muse, if not to mee, I'me sure all game is free; Heaven, Earth, are all but parts of her great Royalty, And when we mean To tast of Bacchus blessings now and then, And drink by stealth A cup or two to noble Barkleys health, I'le take my pipe and try The Phrygina melody; Which he that hears Lets through his ears A madnesse to distemper all the brain. Then I another pipe will take And Dorique musique make, To civilize with greater notes our wits again. An Answer to Mr. Ben Johnson's Ode to perswade him not to leave the stage. Ben do not leave the stage 'Cause 'tis a loathsome age; For Pride and impudence will grow to bold, When they shall hear it told They frighted thee: stand high as is thy cause, Their hisse is thy applause, More just were thy disdain, Had they approv'd thy vain. So thou for them, and they for thee were born, They to incense, and thou as much to scorn. Wilt thou engrosse thy store Of wheat, and powre no more, Because their Bacon-brains have such a tast As more delight in mast? No; set 'em forth a board of dainties, full As thy best Muse can cull; While they the while do pine And thirst, midst all their wine. What greater plague can hell it selfe devise, Then to be willing thus to tantalize? Thou canst not finde them stuffe That will be bad enough To please their pallats; let'em thine refuse For some Pye-corner Muse; She is too fair an hostesse, 'twere a sinne For them to like thine Inne: 'Twas made to entertain, Guests of a nobler strain, Yet if they will have any of thy store, Give'em some scraps, and send them from thy dore. And let those things in Plush, Till they be taught to blush, Like what they will, and more contented be With that Broome swept from thee. I know thy worth, and that thy lofty strains Write not to Cloaths but Brains: But thy great spleen doth rise Cause Moles will have no eyes; This onely in my Ben, I faulty finde He's angry, they'l not see him that are blinde. VVhy should the Scene be Mute Cause thou canst touch my Lute, And string thy Horace: let each Muse of nine Claim thee, and say thou art mine. 'Twere fond to let all other flames expire To sit by Pindar's fire: For by so strange neglect, I should my self suspect The Palsie were as well, thy brains disease; If they could shake thy Muse which way they please. And though thou well canst sing, The glorious of thy King; And on the wings of verse his chariot beare To heaven, and fix it there: Yet let thy Muse as well some wraptures raise, To please him as to praise. I would not have thee choose Onely a treble Muse; But have this envious ignorant Age to know, Thou that canst sing so high, canst reach as low. Thirsis. Lalage. A Dialogue. Th. My Lalage when I behold So great a cold. And not a sparke of heat in thy desire, I wonder what strange power of thine, Kindles in mine So bright a flame, and such a burning fire, Lal. Can Thirsis in Phylosophy A truant be, And not have learn'd the power of the Son; How he to sublunary things A fervour brings, Yet in himself is subject unto none? Thir. But why within thy eyes appear Never a tear. That cause from mine perpetuall showres to fall? Lal. Fool 'tis the power of fire you know To melt the snow. Yet has no moysture in it self at all. Thir. How can I be, dear Virgin show; Both fire and snow? Do you that are the cause, the reason tell; More then miracle to me It seems to be, That so much heat with so much cold should dwell. Lal. The reason I will render thee; Why both should be. Audacious Thirsis in thy love too bold, 'Cause thy saucinesse durst aspire To such a fire, Thy love is hot; but 'tis thy hope is cold. Thir. Let pitty move thy gentle brest To one opprest; This way, or that, give ease to my desire; And either let loves fire be lost In hopes cold frost, Or hopes cold frost be warm'd in loves quick fire. Lal. O neither Boy; neither of these Shall work thy ease. I'le pay thy rashnesse with immortal pain, As hope doth strive to freez thy flame, Love melts the same: As Love doth melt it, Hope doth freez't again. Thir. Come gentle swains lend me a groan To ease my moan. Chorus. Ah cruel Love, how great a power is thine? Under the Poles although we lye Thou mak'st us fry: And thou canst make us freez beneath the line. A Dialogue betwixt a Nymph and a Shepherd. Nym. Why sigh you swain? this passion is not common, I'st for your kids or Lamkins? Sh. for a woman. Nym. How fair is she that on so sage a brow Prints lowring looks? Shep. Iust such a toy as thou. Nymp. Is she a maid? Shep. What man can answer that? Nym. Or widow? Sh. No. Ny. What then? Sh. I know not what, Saint-like she looks, a Syren if she sing, Her eyes are starres, her minde is every thing. Nym. If she be fickle, Shepherd leave to woo Or fancy me. Sh. No thou art woman too; Nym. But I am constant. Sh. Then thou art not fair: Nym. Bright as the morning. Sh. Wavering as the Ayr. Ny. What grows upon this cheek? Sh. A pure Carnation. Ny. Come tast and kisse. Sh. O sweet ô sweet temptation. Chor. Ah Love, and canst thou never loose the field? Where Cupid layes the sieg, the Town must yeeld. He warmes the chiller blood with glowing fire, And thaws the Icy frost of cold desire. A Pastoral Ode. [Coy Cæla dost thou see] Coy Cæla dost thou see Yon hollow mountain tottering o're the plain, O're which a fatall Tree With treacherous shade betrayes the sleepy swain? Beneath it is a Cell, As full of horror as my breast of care, Ruine therein might dwell, As a fit room for guilt and black despair. Thence will I headlong throw This wretched weight, this heap of misery; And in the dust below, Bury my Carcasse; and the thought of thee: Which when I finisht have, O hate me dead as thou hast done alive; And come not neare my grave Least I take heat from thee, and so revive. A Song. [Musick thou Queen of souls, get up and string] Musick thou Queen of souls, get up and string Thy pow'rful Lute, and some sad requiem sing, Till Rocks require thy Eccho with a groan: And the dull clifts repeat the duller tone: Then on a sudden with a nimble hand Run gently o're the Chordes, and so command The Pine to dance, the Oak his Roots forgo, The Holme and aged Elme to soot it too; Mirtles shall caper, lofty Cedars run, And call the Courtly Palme to make up one; Then in the mid'st of all their Iolly train, Strike a sad note; and fix'em Trees again. The Song of Discord. Let Linus and Amphions Lute, With Orpheus Cittern now be mute. The harshest voyce the sweetest note; The Raven has the choycest throat. A set of frogs a quire for me, The Mandrake shall the chanter be, VVhere neither voyce nor tunes agree; This is discords Harmony. Thus had Orpheus learn'd to play The following trees had run away. To one Over-hearing his private discourse. I wonder not my Læda far can see Since for her eyes she might an Eagle be, And dare the Sun; but that she hears so well As that she could my private whisperings tell, I stand amaz'd; her ears are not so long, That they could reach my words, hence then it sprung; Love over-hearing fled to her bright ear, Glad he had got a tale to whisper there. Epigram: 47. ex decimo libro Martialis. These are things that being possest Will make a life that's truly blest: Estate bequeath'd, not got with toyl; A good hot fire, a grateful soil. No strife, warm cloaths, a quiet soule, A strength intire, a body whole, Prudent simplicity 'equal friends, A dyet that no Art commends A night not drunk, and yet secure; A bed not sad, yet chast and pure. Long sleeps to make the nights but short, A will to be but what thou art. Naught rather choose; contented lye, And neither fear, nor wish to dye. To the vertuous and noble Lady, the Lady Cotton. Tis not to force more tears from your sad eye, That we write thus; that were a Piety Turn'd guilt and sin; we onely beg to come And pay due tribute to his sacred tombe. The Muses hid divide his love with you, And justly therefore may be mourners too. In stead of Cypresse, they have brought fresh Bayes To crown his Urin, and every dirge his praise. But since with him the learned tongues are gone, Necessity here makes us use our own. Read in his praise your own, you cannot misse; For he was but our Wonder, you were his. An Elegie on the death of that Renowned &amp; noble Knight, Sir Rowland Cotton of Bellaport in Shropshire. Rich as was Cottons worth, I wish each line; And every verse I breath like him, a Mine, That by his vertues might created be A new strange miracle, wealth in Poetrie. But that invention cannot sure be poore, That but relates a part of his large store. His youth began as when the Sun doth rise Without a Cloud, and clearly trots the skies. And whereas other youths commended be, From conceiv'd Hopes, his was maturity, Where other springs boast blossoms fairly blown. His was a harvest, and had fruits full grown: So that he seem'd a Nector here to raign In wisdome Aeson like, turn'd young again. This, Royall Henry, whose majestique eye Saw thorow men, did from his Court descry, And thither call'd him, and then fix'd him there One of the prime stars in his glorious sphrar. And (Princely Master) witnesse this with me, He liv'd not there to serve himself but thee So Silk-worm Courtier, such as study there First how to get their cloathes, then how to weare. And though in favour high, he nere was known To promote others suits to pay for's own, He valued more his Master, and knew well, To use his love was noble; base to sell. Many there be live in the Court we know To serve for Pageants, and make up the show; And are not serviceable there at all But now and then at some great Festivall. He serv'd for nobler use, the secret cares Of Common-wealths, and mistique State affairs; And when great Henry did his maxims hear, He wore him as a Iewell in his Ear, Yet short he came not, nay he all out-went In what some call a Courtiers complement, An Active body that in subtile wise Turns pliable to any excuse. For when he leapt, the people dar'd to say He was born all of fire, and wore no clay: Which was the cause too that he wrestled, Tis not fires nature to be kept below. His course he so perform'd with nimble pace, The time was not perceiv'd measur'd the race, As it were true that some late Artists say, The Earth mov'd too, and run the other way, All so soon finish'd, when the match was won The gazers by ask'd why they not begun, When he in Masque us'd his harmonious feet, The Sphears could not in comlier order meet; Nor move more gracefull, whether they advance Their measures forward, or retire their dance. There we have seen him in our Henry's Court The glory and the envy of that sport. And capring like a constellation rise, Having fixt upon him all the Ladyes eyes, But these in him I would not vertues call, But that the world must know that he had all, When Henry dy'd) our universal wo) Willing was Cotton to dye with him too, And as near death he came as near could be; Himself he buried in obscurity, Entomb'd within his study walls, and there Onely the dead his conversation were. Yet was he not alone, for every day, Each Muse came thither with her sprig of Bay. The Graces round about him did appear, The Genii of all Nations, all met there. And while immur'd he sat thus close at home. To him the wealth of all the world did come. He had a language to salute the Sun, Where he unharnest, and where's team begun: The tongues of all the East to him were known As Naturall, as they were born his own. Which from his mouth so sweetly did entice, As with their language he had mix't their spice. In Greek so fluent, that with it compare Te' Athenian Olives, and they saplesse are. Rome did submit her Fasces, and confesse Her Tully might talk more, and yet speak lesse. All Sciences were lodg'd in his large brest, And in that Pallace thought themselves so blest They never meant to part, but he should be Sole Monarch, and dissolve their Heptarchie. But O how vain is mans frail Harmony! We all are Swans, he that sings best must dye. Death knowledge nothing makes, when we come there VVe need no Language, nor Interpreter. Who would not laugh at him now, that should seek In Cotton's Urn for Hebrew or for Greek? But his more heav'nly graces with him yet Live constant, and about him circled sit. A bright Retinue, and on each falls down A robe of Glory, and on each a Crown. Then Madam (though you have a losse sustain'd Both infinite, and ne're to be regain'd Here in this world) dry your sad eyes, once more You shall again enter the Nuptiall dore A spritely bride; where you shall cloathed be In garments weav'd of Immortality. Nor grieve because he left you not a Sonne, To Image Cotton forth now he is gone. For it had been a wrong to his great Name T'have liv'd in any thing but Heaven and Fame. Ausonii Epigram. 38 She which would not, I would choose: She which would, I would refuse. Venus could my minde but tame; But not satisfie the same. Inticements offer'd I despise, And deny'd I slightly price. I would neither glut my minde, Nor yet too much torment finde. Twice girt Diana doth not take me, Nor Venus naked joyful make me. The first no pleasure hath to joy me, And the last enough to cloy me. But a crafty wench I'de have That can sell the act I crave: And joyne at once in me these two, I will, and yet I will not do. On the Death of a Nightingale. Go solitary wood, and henceforth be Acquainted with no other Harmony, Then the Pyes chattering, or the shreeking note Of bodeing Owles, and fatall Ravens throat. The sweetest chanters dead, that warbled forth Layes that might tempests calm, and still the North, And call down Angels from their glorious Sphear To hear her Songs, and learn new Anthems there. That soul is fled, and to Elision gone; Thou art a poor desert left; go then and run, Beg there to stand a grove, and if she please To sing again beneath thy shadowy Trees; The souls of happy lovers crown'd with blisses Shall flock about thee, and keep time with kisses. Vpon the report of the King of Swedens death. I'le not beleeve't; if fate should be so crosse, Nature would not be silent of her losse. Can he be dead, and no portents appear? No pale Eclipse of th'Sun to let us fear What we should suffer, and before his light Put out, the world eveloped in Night. What thundring torrents the flulsh'd welkin tare? What apparitions kill'd him in the ayr? When Cæsar dy'd, there were convulsion fits; And nature seem'd to run out of her wits. At that sad object Tybers bosome swell'd, And scarce from drowning all by Jove withheld; And shall we give this mighty Conquerer That in a great and a more holy warre, Was pulling down the Empire which he reard, A fall unmourn'd of Nature, and unfear'd; A death (unlesse the league of heav'n withstood) Lesse wept then with an universal flood? If I had seen a Comet in the Ayr With glorious eye, and bright disheve'd hair, And on a sudden with his gilded train Drop down; I should have said that Sweden's slain; Shot like that star, or if the earth had shook Like a weak floor, the falling roof had broke; I should have said the mighty King is gone; Fell'd as the tallest tree in Libanon. A lasse if he were dead, we need no post, Very instinct would tell us what we lost. And a chill damp (as at the general doom) Creep through each brest, &amp; we should know for whom. His German conquests are not yet compleat, And when they are, there's more remayning yet, The world is full of sin, not every Land O're grown with schisme hath felt his purging hand. The Pope is not confounded, and the Turk; Nor was he sure design'd for a lesse work. But if our sins have stop'd him in the source, In mid'dst Career of his victorious course; And heaven would trust the dulnesse of our sence So far, not to prepare us with portents. 'Tis we that have the losse, and he hath caught His heav'nly garland e're his work he wrought. But I, before I'le undertake to grieve So great a losse, will choose not to believe. On Sir Robert Cotton the Antiquary. Posterity hath many fates bemoan'd, But Ages long since past for thee have groan'd, Times Trophies thou didst rescue from the grave, Who in thy death a second burial have. Cotton, deaths conquest now compleat I see, Who ne're had vanquisht all things but in thee. An Elegie. [Heav'n knows my love to thee, fed on desires] Heav'n knows my love to thee, fed on desires So hallowed, and unmixt with vulgar fires, As are the purest beams shot from the Sun At his full height, and the devotion Of dying Martyrs could not burn more clear, Nor innocence in her first robes appear Whiter then our affections; they did show Like frost forc'd out of flames, and fire from snow. So pure, the Phœnix when she did refine Her age to youth, borrowed no flames but mine. But now my day's o'recast, for I have now Drawn Anger like a tempest o're the brow Of my faire Mistresse; those your glorious eyes Whence I was wont to see my day-star rise, Threat like revengefull Meteors; and I feel My torment, and my guilt double my hell. 'Twas a mistake, and might have veniall been, Done to another, but it was made sin, And justly mortal too by troubling thee, Slight wrongs are treasons done to Majesty. O all ye blest Ghosts of deceased Loves, That now live Sainted in th'Blisian groves Mediate for mercy for me; at her shrine Meet with full quire, and joyne your prayers with mine. Conjure her by the merits of your kisses, By your past sufferings and your present blisses, Conjure her by your mutual hopes, and fears; By all your intermixed sighes and tears, To plead my pardon: go to her and tell That you will walk the guardian sentinell, My souls safe Genii, that she need not fear A mutinous thought, or one close rebell there. But what needs that, when she alone sits there Sole Angel of that Orbe? in her own sphere Alone she sits, and can secure it free From all irregular motions; onely she Can give the Balsom that must cure this sore; And the sweet Antidote to sin no more. ? ?????? ??? ??????? ??? ???????. From witty men and mad All Poetry conception had. No Sires but these will Poetry admit, Madnesse or wit. This definition Poetry doth fit, It is a witty madnesse, or mad wit. Onely these two Poetiques heat admits, A witty man, or one that's out of's wits. An Anicum Litigantem. Would you commence a Poet Sir, and be A graduate in the thredbare mystery? The Oxes ford will no man thither bring. Where the horse hoofe rais'd the Pegasian spring, Nor will the bridge through which low Cham doth run, direct you to the banks of Helicon. If in that art you mean to take degrees, Bedlam's the best of Universities. There study it, and when you would no more A Poet be, go drink some Hellebore. Which drug when I had tasted, soon I left The bare Parnassus, and the barren cleft; And can no more one of their Nation be, Because recover'd of my lunacy. But you may then succeed me in my place Of Poet, no pretence to make your grace Denyed you, for you go to law, 'tis said; And then 'tis ta'ne for granted you are mad. In Croydonem &amp; Corinnam. Paraphras'd. The original Latin verse has been omitted here. Ah wretch in thy Corinna's love unblest! How strang a fancy doth torment thy breast? When she desires to sport, thou sayest her nay; When she denyes then thou desir'st to play. Love burns you both (O 'tis a happy turn!) But 'tis at several times love doth both burn. When scorching heat hath Coridons heart possest, Then raigns a frost in cold Corinna's brest; And when a frost in Coridon doth raign, Then is Corinna's brest on fire again, And then with Coridon is it summer prime, When with Corinna it is winter time? Or why should then Corinna's summer be When it is winter, Coridon with thee? Can Ice from fire, or fire from Ice proceed? Ah jest not Love in so severe a deed! I bid thee not Coridons flame to blow Clean out; nor clean to melt Corinna's snow. burn both! freez both! let mutuall Fervour hold His and her brest, or his and her's a cold. To one admiring her self in a Looking-Glasse. Faire Lady when you see the Grace Of beauty in your Looking Glasse; A stately forehead, smooth and high, And full of Princely Majesty. A sparkling eye, no gem so fair, Whose lustre dims the Cyprian star. A glorious cheek divinely sweet, Wherein both Roses kindely meet. A cherry Lip that would entice Even gods to kisse at any price. You think no beauty is so rare That with your shadow might compare, That your reflection is alone, The thing that men most dote upon, Madam, alas your Glasse doth lye, And you are much deceiv'd; for I A beauty know of richer grace (Sweet be not angry) 'tis your face. Hence then O learn more milde to be, And leave to lay your blame on me; If me your reall substance move, When you so much your Shadovv love. Wise nature would not let your eye Look on her own bright Majesty, Which had you once but gaz'd upon, You could, except your self, love none: Whar then you cannot love, let me, That face I can, you cannot see. Now you have what you love, you'l say What then is left for me I pray? My face sweet-heart, if it please thee; That which you can, I cannot see: So either love shall gain his due. Your's sweet in me, and mine in you. A Eglogue occasion'd by two Doctors disputing upon Prædestination. Corydon. Ho jolly Thyrsis whether in such hast? I'st for a wager that you run so fast? Or past past your hour below yon Hawthorn-tree Doe's longing Gælatea look for thee? Thyrsis. No Corydon, I heard young Daphnis say Alexis challeng'd Tityrus to day Who best shall sing of Shepherds Art, and praise; But heark I hear 'em listen to their layes. Tityrus. Alexis read, what means this mystique thing? An Ewe I had two Lambs at once did bring; Th'one black as jet, the other white as snow? Say in just Providence how it could be so? Alexis. Will you Pan's goodnesse therefore partiall call, That might as well have given thee none at all? Tytirus. Were they not both and by the selfe-same Ewe? How could they ment then so different hue? Poor Lamb alas; and couldst thou, yet unborn, Sin to deserve the guilt of such a scorn! Thou hadst not yet fowl'd a religious spring, Nor fed on plots of hollowed grasse, to bring Stains to thy fleece; nor browz'd upon a tree Sacred to Pan, or Pales Deity. The gods are ignorant, if they not foreknow; And knowing, 'tis unjust to use thee so. Alexis. Tityr with me contend, or Corydon; But let the gods, and their high wils alone: For in our Flocks that freedom challenge wee; This Kid is sacrific'd, and that goes free. Tityrus. Feed where you will my Lambs, what boots it us To watch, and water, fold, and drive you thus. This on the barren mountains flesh can glean, That fed in flowry pastures will be lean. Alexis. Plow, sowe, and compasse, nothing boots at all, Unlesse the dew upon the Tilth's do fall. So labour silly Shepherds what we can All's vain, unlesse a blessing drop from Pan. Tityrus. I'll thrive thy Ewes if thou these lyes maintain. Alexis. And may thy Goats miscarry sawcy swain. Thyrsis. Fie, Shepherds fie! while you these strifes begin, Here creeps the Wolf, and there the Fox gets in. To your vaine piping on so deep a Reed The Lamkins listen, but forget to feed. It gentle swains befits of Love to sing, How Love left Heaven; and heavens immortall King. His Coeternal Father. O admire, Love is a Son as ancient as his Sire. His Mother was a Virgin: how could come A birth so great, and from so chast a womb? His cradle was a manger; Shepherds see True faith delights in poor simplicity. He pres'd no grapes, nor prun'd the fruitfull vine, But could of water make a brisker wine. Nor did he plow the earth, and to his Barn The harvest bring, nor thresh, and grinde the Corn. Without all these Love could supply our need, And with five Loavs, five thousand Hungers feed, More wonders did he, for all which suppose How he was crown'd, with Lilly or with Rose? The winding Ivy, or the glorious Bay, Or Mirtle, with the which Venus, they say, Girts her proud Temples? Shepherds none of them But wore (poor head) a thorny Diadem. Feet to the Lame he gave, with which they run To work their Surgeons last destruction. The blinde from him had eyes; but us'd that light Like Basilisques to kill him with their sight. Lastly he was betrai'd (O sing of this) How Love could be betrai'd! 'twas with a kisse. And then his innocent hands, and guiltlesse feet Were nail'd unto the crosse, striving to meet In his spread arms his Spouse, so milde in show He seem'd to court th'Imbraces of his foe. Through his pierc'd side, through which a sphear was sent, A torrent of all flowing Balsame went. Run Amorillis run: one drop from thence Cures thy sad soul, and drives all anguish hence. Go sun-burnt Thestylis, go, and repair thy beauty lost, and be again made fair, Love-sick Amyntas get a Phyltrum here, To make thee Lovely to thy truly dear. But coy Licoris take the Pearl from thine, And take the Blood-shot from Atexis eyne. Weare this an Amulet against all Syrens smiles, The stings of Snakes, and tears of Crocodiles, Now Love is dead: Oh no, he never dies; Three dayes he sleeps, and then again doth rise, (Like fair Aurora from the Eastern Bay) And with his beams drives all our clouds away: This pipe unto our flocks, this sonnet get. But ho, I see the Sun ready to set. Good night to all, for the great night is come: Flocks to your folds, and Shepherds high you home. Tomorrow morning, when we all have slept, Pan's Cornet's blowen, and the great Sheep-shears kept. An Eglogue to M. Johnson. Tityrus. Vnder this Beech why sits thou heere so sad Son Damon, that was erst Jovall lad? These groves were wont to Eccho with the sound Of thy shrill reed, while every Nymph danc'd round. Rouse up thy soul, Parnassus mount stands high, And must be clim'd with painfull industry, Damon. You Father on his forked top sit still, And see us panting up so steep a hill: But I have broke my reed, and deeply swore Never with wax, never to joynt it more. Tyt. Fond boy 'twas rashly done; I meant to thee, Of all the sons I have, by legacie To have bequeath'd my pipe, thee, thee of all I meant it should her second Master call. Dam. And do you think I durst presume to play Where Tytirus had worn his lips away! Live long thy self to tune it; 'tis from thee, It has not from it self such Harmony. But if we ever such disaster have As to compose our Tityrus in his grave; Yonder, upon yon aged Oak, that now Old trophies bears, on every sacred bow We'l hang it up a relick, we will do it, And learned swains shall pay devotion to it, Tyt. Canst thou farewell unto the Muses bid? Then Bees shall loath the Thyme, the new wean'd Kid Browze on the buds no more; the reeming ews Henceforth the tender fallows shall refuse. Dam. I by those Ladies now do nothing set; Let 'em for me some other servant get: They shall no more be Mistresses of mine, No, though my pipe had hope to equall thine, Thine which the floods have stopt their course to heare To which the spotted Linx hath lent an ear. Which while the severall Echo's would repeat, The Musick has been sweet, the Art so great That Pan himself amaz'd at thy deep aires, Sent thee of his own bowl to drown thy cares. Of all the gods Pan doth the pipe respect, The rest unlearned pleasures more affect. Pan ern distinguish what thy Raptures be From Bavius loose lascivious Minstralsie, Or Marvius windy Bagpipe, Mævius, he Whose wit is but a Tavern Tympany. If ever I flock of my own do feed, My fattest Lambs shall on his Altar bleed. Tyt Two Altars I will build him, and each year Will sacrifice two well-fed Bullocks there; Two that have horns, that while they butting stand Strike from their feet a cloud of numerous sand. But what can make thee leave the Muses, man, That such a Patron hast as mighty Pan? Whence is this fury? Did the partiall ear Of the rude Vulgar, when they late did hear Egon, and thee contend which best should play, Him Victour deem, and give thy kid away? Does Amarillis cause this high despair? Or Galatea's coynesse breed thy care? Dam. Neither of these, the Vulgar I contemn: Thy pipe, not always Tytirus wins with them: And as for Love, insooth I do not know Whether he wears a bow, and shafts or no. Or did I, I a way could quickly find, To win the beauteous Galatea's mind, Or Amarillis: I to both could send Apples that with Hesperian fruit contend: And on occasion could have quickly guest Where two fair Ring-doves built their amorous nest: Tyt. If none of these, my Damon then aread What other cause can so much passion breed! Dam. Father, I will, in those indulgent ears I dare unload the burden of my fears. The Reapers that with whetted sickles stand, Gathering the falling ears 'ith' other hand; Though they endure the scorching summers heat, Have yet some wages to allay their sweat: The Lopper that doth fell the sttudry Oke Labours, yet has good pay for every stroak. The Plowman is rewarded: onely we That sing are paid with our own melody; Rich churles have learnt to praise us, and admire, But have not learnt to think us worth the bite. So toiling Ants perchance delight to hear, The summer musick of the Grashopper. But after rather let him starve with pain, Then spare him from their store one single grain. As when great Iunos beauteous bird displayes Her starry tail, the boyes do run and gaze At her proud train; so look they now adaies On Poets: and do think if they but praise, Or pardon what we sing, enough they do: I, and tis well that they do so much too. My rage is swell'd so high I cannot speak it, Had I Pan's Pipe or thine I now should break it! Tyt. Let Moles delight in Earth; Swine dung-hils rake, Crowes prey on Carrion; Frogs a pleasure take In slimy Pools; and Niggards wealth admire; But we whose souls are made of purer fire, Have other aimes: whose songs for gain hath made, Has of a liberall Science fram'd a Trade. Hark how the Nightingale in yonder tree, Hid in the boughs, warbles melodiously Her various musique forth, while the whole Quire Of other birds flock round, and all admire! But who rewards her? will the ravenous Kite Part with her prey to pay for her delight? Or will the foolish, painted, prattling Iay Now turn'd a hearer, to requite her play Lend her a straw? or any of the rest Fetch her a fether when she builds her nest? Yet sings she ne're the lesse, till every den Do catch at her last notes: And shall I then His fortunes, Damon, 'bove my own commend, Who can more cheese into the market send: Clowns for posterite may cark and care, That cannot out-live death but in an Heir: By more then wealth we propogate our Names, That trust not to successions, but our Fames. Let hid-bound churles yoak the laboriug Ox, Milk hundred goates, and share a thousand flocks; Plant gainfull Orchards, and in silver shine; Thou of all fruits should'st onely prune the Vine, Whose fruit being tasted, might erect thy brain To teach some ravishing, high, and lofty strain; The double birth of Baccbus to express, First in the Grape, the second in the Presse. And therefore tell me boy, what is't can move Thy minde once fixed on the Muses Love? Dam. When I contented liv'd by Cham's fair streams, Without desire to see the prouder Thames, I had no flock to care for, but could sit Under a Willow covert, and repeat Those deep and learned layes, on every part Grounded on judgement, subtilty, and Art. That the great Tutor to the greatest King, The shepheard of Stagira, us'd to sing; The Shepheord of Stagira, that unfolds All natures Closet, shews what e're it holds The matter, forme, sence, motion, place, and measure Of every thing contain'd in her vast treasure. How Elements do change; What is the cause Of Generation; what the Rule and Laws The Orbs do move by; Censures every starre, Why this is fixt, and this irregular; Knows all the Heavens, as if he had been there, And help't each Angell turn about her sphear. The thirsty pilgrim travelling by land, When the fierce Dog-star doth the day command, Halfe choak'd with dust, parch't with the soultry heate, Tir'd with his journey, and o'recome with sweat, Finding a gentle spring, at her cool brink Doth not with more delight sit down and drink, Then I record his songs: we see a cloud, And fearing to be wet, do run and shroud Vnder a bush, when he would sit and tell The cause that made her misty womb to swell; Why it sometimes in drops of rain doth flow, Sometimes dissolves her selfe in flakes of snow: Nor gaz'd he at a Comet, but would frame A reason why it wore a beard of flame. Ah Tytirus, I would with all my heart, Even with the best of my carv'd mazers part, To hear him, as he us'd, divinely shew, What 'tis that paints the divers colour'd bow: Whence thunders are discharg'd, whence the winds stray, What foot through heaven hath worn the milky wayes And yet I let this true delight alone, Cal'd thence to keep the flock of Corydon. Ah wo is me anothers flock to keep; The care is mine, the master shears the sheep! A flock it was that would not keep together; A flock that had no fleece when it came hither, Nor would it learn to listen to my layes, For 'twas a flock made up of severall strayes: And now I would return to Cham, I hear A desolation frights the Muses there! With rustick swains I mean to spend my time; Teach me there father to preserve my rime. Tyt. To morrow morning I will counsell thee, Meet me at Faunus Beech; for now you see How larger shadows from the mountains fall, And Corydon doth Damon, Damon call. Damon, 'tis time my flock were in the fold, More then high time, did you not erst behold How Hesperus above yon clouds appear'd, Hesperus leading forth his bounteous heard? A Pastorall Courtship. Behold these woods, and mark my Sweet How all these boughes together meet! The Cedar his fair arms displayes; And mixes branches with the Bayes. The lofty Pine dains to descend, And sturdy Oaks do gently bend. One with another subt'ly weaves Into one loom their various leaves; As all ambitious were to be Mine and my Phyllis canopie! Let's enter, and discourse our Loves; These are, my dear, no tell-tale groves! There dwell no Pyes, nor Parrots there, To prate again the words they heare. Nor babling Echo, that will tell The neighbouring hills one syllable. Being enter'd lets together lye, Twin'd like the Zodiaks Gemini! How soon the flowers do sweeter smell? And all with emulation swell To be thy pillow? These for thee Were meant a bed, and thou for me, And I may with as just esteem Presse thee, as thou mayst lie on them. And why so coy? What dost thou fear? There lurks no speckled Serpent here. No Venemous snake makes this his rode, No Canker, nor the loathsome Toad. And yon poor spider on the tree, Thy spinster will, no poysoner be, There is no Frog to leap and fright Thee from my arms and break delight; Nor Snail that o're thy coat shall trace, And leave behind a slimy lace. This is the hallowed shrine of Love, No wasp nor hornet haunts this grove, Nor Pismire to make pimples rise Upon thy smooth and ivory thighes. No danger in these shades doth lye, Nothing that wears a sting: but I: And in it doth no venome dwell, Although perchance it make thee swell. Being set, let's sport a while my Fair, I will tie Love-knots in thy hair. See Zephyrus through the leaves doth stray, And has free liberty to play: And braids thy locks: And shall I find Lesse favour then a saucy winde? Now let me sit, and fix my eyes, On thee that art my Paradise. Thou art my all; the spring remains In the fair violets of thy vains: And that it is a summers day, Ripe Cherries in thy lips display. And when for Autumn I would seek. 'Tis in the Apples of thy cheek. But that which onely moves my smart, Is to see winter in thy heart. Strange, when at once in one appear All the four seasons of the year! I'le clasp that neck where should be set A rich and Orient Carkanet; But swains are poor, admit of then More naturall chains, the arms of men. Come let me touch those breasts, that swell Like two fair mountains, and may well Be stil'd the Alpes, but that I fear The snow has lesse of whitenesse there. But stay (my Love) a fault I spie, Why are these two fair fountains dry? Which if they run, no Muse would please To tast of any spring but these. And Ganymed employ'd should be To fetch his love Nectar from thee. Thou shalt be Nurse fair Venus swears, To the next Cupid that she bears. Were it not then discreetly done To ope one spring to let two run? Fy, fy, this Belly, Beauty's mint, Blushes to see no coyn stampt in't. Employ it then, for though it be Our wealth it is your royalty; And beauty will have currant grace That bears the image of your face. How to the touch the Ivory thighes Veil gently, and again do rise, As plyable to impression As Virgins wax, or Barian stone Dissolv'd to softnesse; plump, and full, More white and soft then Cotsall wool, Or Cotten from from the Indian Tree, Or prety silk-worms huswifery. These on two marble pillars rais'd Make me in doubt which should be prais'd; They, or their Columnes must; but when I view those feet that I have seen So nimbly tript it o're the Lawns, That all the Satyrs and the Fawns Have stood amaz'd, when they would passe Over the layes, and not a grasse Would feel the weight, nor rush, nor bent Drooping betray which way you went, O then I felt my hot desires Burn more, and flame with double fires. Come let those thighes, those legs those feet VVith mine in thousand windings meet. And woven in more subtle twines Then VVoodbine, Ivie, or the Vines. For when Love sees us circling thus He'le like no Arbour more then us. Now let us kisse, would you be gone? Manners at least allows me one. Blush you at this? pretty one stay, And I will take that kisse away, Thus with a second, and that too A third wipes off; so will we go To numbers that the stars out-run, And all the Atoms in the Sun. For though we kisse till Phœbus ray Sink in the seas, and kissing stay Till his bright beams return again, There can of all but one remain: And if for one good manners call, In one, good manners, grant me all. Are kisses all? they but fore-run Another duty to be done. What would you of that Minstrell say That tunes his pipes and will not play? Say what are blossoms in their prime, That ripen not in harvest time? Or what are buds that ne're disclose The long'd for sweetnesse of the rose? So kisses to a Lover's guest Are invitations, not the feast. See every thing that we espie Is fruitfull saving you and I: View all the fields, survey the bowers, The buds, the blossoms, and the flowers, And say if they so rich could be In barren base Virginity. Earth's not so coy as you are now, But willingly admits the Plow. For how had man or beast been fed, If she had kept her maiden-head? Cœlia once coy as are the rest Hangs now a babe on either breast, And Chloris since a man she took, Has lesse of greennesse in her look. Our Ewes have ean'd, and every damme Gives suck unto her tender Lamb. As by these groves we walk'd along, Some birds were feeding of their young. Some on their egges did brooding sit, Sad that they had not hatch'd them yet. Those that were slower then the rest, Were busie building of the nest. You only will not pay the fine, You vow'd and ow'd to Valentine. As you were angling in the brook With silken line and silver hook, Through Chrystall streams you might descry How vast and numberlesse a fry The fish hath spawn'd, that all along The banks were crowded with the throng. And shall fair Venus more command By water then she does by land? The Phænix chast, yet when she dies, Her selfe with her owne ashes lies. But let thy love more wisely thrive To do the act while th' art alive. 'Tis time we left our childish Love That trades for toyes, and now approve Our abler skill; they are not wise Look babies only in the eyes. That smoother'd smile shewes what you meant, And modest silence gives consent. That which we now prepare, will be Best done in silent secresie. Come do not weep, what is't you fear? Lest some should know what we did here. See not a flower you prest is dead, But re-erects his bended head; That whosoe're shall passe this way Knows not by these where Phyllis lay. And in your forehead there is none Can read the act that we have done. Phyllis. Poor credulous and simple maid! By what strange wiles art thou bearaid! A treasure thou hast lost to day For which thou canst no ransome pay. How black art thou, transform'd with sin! How strange a guilt gnaws me within? Grief will convert this red to pale; When every Wake, and Whitsund-ale Shall talk my shame; break, break sad heart There is no Medicine for my smart, No herb nor balm can cure my sorrow, Unlesse you meet again to morrow. Upon a very deformed Gentlewoman, but of a voyce incomparable sweet. I chanc'd sweet Lesbia's voyce to hear, O that the pleasure of the eare Contented had the appetite; But I must satisfie the sight: Where such a face I chanc'd to see From which good Lord deliver me. I'st not prophane if I should tell I thought her one of those that fell With Lucifers Apostate train Yet did her Angels voyce retain? A Cherubin her notes descri'd, A Devill every where beside. Ask the dark woods, and they'l confesse None did such Harmony expresse In all their bowers, from May to June Yet ne're was face so out of tune. Her Virginall teeth false time did keep, Her wrinkled forehead went too deep. Lower then Gammus sunk her eyes, 'Bove Ela though her nose did rise. I'le trust Musitians now that rest Best musick doth in discords dwell, Her ayres entic'd the gentle quire Of Birds to come, who all admire, And would with pleasure longer stay, But that her looks frights them away. Which for a good Priapus goes, And well may serve to scar the Crows. Her voyce might tempt th'immortall race But let her only shew her face. And soon she might extinguish thus The lusting of an Incubus. So have I seen a Lute o'reworn, Old and rotten, patcht, and torn, So ravish with a sound, and bring A close so sweet to every string, As would strike wonder in our ears, And work an envy in the Sphears. Say monster strange, what maist thou be? Whence shall I fetch thy Pedigree? VVhat but a Panthar could beget, A beast so foule, a breath so sweet? Or thou of Syrens issue art, If they be fish the upper part. Or else blind Homer was not mad Then, when he sung Vlisses had So strange a gift from Acolus, VVho odour-breathing Zephyrus In severall bottles did inclose; For certain thou art one of those Thy looks where other women place Their chiefest Pride, is thy disgrace. The tongue, a part which us'd to be VVorst in thy Sex, is best in thee. VVere I but now to choose my dear Not by my eye, but by my ear, Here would I dote; how shall I woo Thy voyce, and not thy body too? Then all the brood I get of thee, VVou'd Nightingales and Cygnets be: Cygnets betimes their throats to try, Born with more Musick then the dye. Say Lesbia, say, what god will blesse Our Loves with so much happinesse? Some women are all tongue, but o VVhy art nor thou my Lesbia so? Thy looks do speak thee witch; one spell To make thee but invisible, Or dye! resign thy selfe to death, And I will catch thy latest breath; But that the nose will scarce I feare Finde it so sweet as did the ear. Or if thou wouldst not have me coy, As was the self-enamour'd Boy, Turn only voyce, an Echo prove, Here, here, by heav'n, I'le fix my Love, If not, you gods, to ease my mind, Or make her dumb, or strike me blind; For grief, and anger in me rise, Whilst she hath tongue, or I have eyes. The Milk-maids Epithælamium Ioy to the Bridegroom and the Bride That lye by one anothers side! O fie upon the Virgin beds, No losse is gain but Maiden heads. Love quickly send the time may be When I shall deale my Rosemary! I long to simper at a feast, To dance, and kisse, and do the rest. When I shall Wed, and Bedded be O then the qualm comes over me, And tels the sweetnesse of a Theam That I nere knew but in a dream. You Ladies have the blessed nights, I pine in hope of such delights: And silly Damsell only can Milk the Cows teats, and think on man, And sigh and wish to tast and prove The wholsome Sillibub of Love. Make hast, at once twin-Brothers bear; And leave new matter for a star. Women and ships are never shown So fair as when their sails are blown ?!? Then when the Midwife heares your moane, I'le sigh for grief that I have none. And you deare Knight, whose every kisse Reaps the full crop of Cupids blisse, Now you have found, confesse and tell That single sheets do make up hell. And then so charitable be To get a man to pity me. An Eglogue on the noble Assemblies revived on Cotswold Hills, by M. Robert Dover. Collen. Thenot. What Clod-pates, Thenot, are our Brittish swains How Lubber-like they loll upon the plains? No life, no spirit in 'em; every Clown Soon as he layes his Hook and Tarbox down, That ought to take his Reed, and chant his layes, Or nimbly run the winding of the Maze, Now gets a bush to room himself, and sleep; 'Tis hard to know the shepherd from the sheep. And yet me thinks our English pastures be As flowry as the Lawns of Arcadie: Our Virgins blith as theirs, nor can proud Greece Boast purer aire, nor sheer a finer fleece. The. Yet view their outside, Collen, you would say They have as much brawn in their necks as they. Fair Tempa brags of lusty arms that swell With able sinewes, and might hurl as well The weighty sledg; their legs, and thighes of bone, Great as Colossus, yet their strength is gone, They look like yonder man of wood, that stands To bound the limits of the Parish-lands. Dost thou ken, Collen, what the cause might be Of such a dull and generall Lethargy? Col Swain, with their sports their souls were ta'ne away, Till then they all were active, every day They exercis'd to weild their limbs, that now Are numb'd to every thing, but flail and plow. Early in May up got the jolly rout Call'd by the Lark, and spread the fields about: One for to breath himself, would coursing be From this same Beech to yonder Mulberie. A second leapt, his supple nerves to try, A third was practising his Melody. This a new Jig was footing, others were Busied at wrestling, or to throw the Barre: Ambitious who should beare the Bell away, And kisse the Nut-brown Lady of the May. This stirr'd 'em up, a jolly swain was me Whom Peg and Susan after Victory Crown'd with a garland they had made, beset With Daisies, Pinks, and many a Violet, Cowslip, and Gilliflower. Rewards though small, Encourage vertue, but if none at all Meet her, she languisheth, and dies, as now Where worth's deny'd the honour of a bough. And, Thenot, this the cause I read to be Of such a dull and generall Lethargie. Th. Ill thrive the Lowt that did their mirth gain-say, Wolves haunt his flocks, that took those sports away! Col. Some melancholy swains about have gone To teach all zeale their own complexion: Choler they will admit sometimes I see, But Flegme, and Sanguine no Religions be. These teach that Dauncing is a Jezabell, And Barley-break the ready way to Hell. The Morice-Idols, Whitsun-ales can be But prophane Reliques of a Jubilee! These in a zeale, t'expresse how much they do The Organs hate, have silenc'd Bag-pipes too; And harmlesse May-poles, all are rail'd upon As if they were the towers of Babylon. Some think not fit there should be any sport I'th Countrey, 'tis a dish proper to the Court. Mirth not becomes 'em, let the Tawcy swain Eat Beefe, and Bacon, and goe sweat again. Besides, what sport can in their pastimes be When all is but ridiculous foppery? The. Collen, I once the famous Spain did see, A nation glorious for their gravity; Yet there a hundred Knights on warlike Steeds Did skirmish out a fight arm'd but with reeds; At which a thousand Ladies eyes did gaze, Yet 'twas no better then our Prison-base. What is the Barriers but a Courtly way Of our more down-right sport, the Cudgel-play? Foot-ball with us may be with them Baloome, As they at Tilt, so we at Quintain runne. And those old Pastimes relish best with me, That have least Art, and most simplicity. Collen. They say at Court there is an Art To dance a Ladies honour from her heart; Such wiles poor Shepheards know not, all their sense Is dull to any thing but Innocence. The Country Lasse, although her dance be good, Stirs not anothers Galliard in the Blood. And yet their sports by some controul'd have been, Who think there is no mirth but what is sin. O might I but their harmlesse Gambols see Restor'd unto an ancient liberty, Where spotlesse dalliance traces o're the Plains, And harmles Nymphs jet it with harmles swains; To see an age again of Innocent Loves Twine close as Vines, yet kisse as chast as Doves, Me thinks I could the Thracian lyre have strung, Or tun'd my whistle to the Mantum song. Coll. Then tune thy whistle boy, and string thy lyre That age is come again, thy brave desire Pan hath approv'd; dauncing shall be this yeer Holy as the motion of a Sphear. blew The. Col. with sweeter breath Fame never Her sacred Trump, if this good news be true! Coll. Knowest thou not Cotswold hills? Th. Through all the land No finer wool runnes through the spinsters hand. But silly Collen, ill thou dost divine, Canst thou mistake a Bramble for a Pine? Or think this Bush a Cedar? or suppose Young Hamlet, where to sleep each shepheard goes, In circuit, buildings, people, power and name Equalls the Bow string'd by the silver Thame? As well thou maist their sports with ours compare, As the soft wool of Lambs, with the Goats hair. Col. Last evening Lad, I met a noble swain, That spur'd his sprightfull Palfrey o're the plain, His head with ribbands crown'd, and deckt as gay As any Lasse upon her Bridall day: I thought (what easie faiths we shepheards prove) This, not the Bull, had been Europa's Love! I ask't the cause, they told me this was he, Whom this dayes triumph crown'd with victory; Many brave steeds there were, some you should finde So fleet as they had been sons of the winde: Others with hoofs so swift, beat o're the race As if some engine shot 'em to the place. So many, and so well-wing'd steeds there were As all the brood of Pegasus had been there. Rider, and horse could not distinguish'd be, Both seem'd conjoyn'd a Centaur's progeny, A numerous troop they were, yet all so light Earth never groan'd, nor felt 'em in their flight, Such Royall pastimes Cotswold mountains fill, When gentle swains visit her glorious hill: Where with such packs of hounds they hunting go As Cyrus nere did wind his Bugle to! Whose noise is musicall, and with full cries Beats o're the fields, and Ecchoes through the skies, Orion hearing wish'd to leave his sphere, And call his dog from heaven to sport it there. Watt though he fled for life, yet joy'd withall So brave a dirge sung forth his funerall. Not Syrens sweetlier rill, Hares as they flie Look back, as glad to listen, loth to die. Thes. No doubt but from the brave Heroick fire In the more noble hearts, sparks of desire May warm this colder boores, and emulous strife, Give the old Mirth and Innocence a new life. When thoughts of fame their quickned souls shall fill At every glaunce that shews them Cotswold hill. Coll. There Shepherd, there, the solemn games be plaid, Such as great Thesus, or Alcides made: Such as Apollo wishes he had seen, And Iove desires had his invention been! The Nemean, and the Istmian pastimes still Though dead in Greece, survive on Cotswold hill. The. Oh happy hill the gentle Graces now Shall trip o're Thine and leave Citherons brow: Parnasius clift shall sink below his spring, And every Muse shall on thy frontlet sing. The goddesses again in strife shall be, And from mount Ida make appeale to thee; Olympus pay thee homage, and in dread The aged Alpes shall bow his snowy head; Flora with all her store thy Temples Crown, Whose height shall reach the stars: gods looking down Shall blesse the Incense that thy flowers exhale, And make thee both a mountain and a Vale. How many Ladies on thy top shall meet, And presse thy tresses with their od'rous feet? Whose eyes when wandring men see from afar, They'l think thee Heaven, and each of them a star. But gentle Collen say what god or man Fame we for this great work, Daphnis, or Pan? Col. Daphnis is dead, and Pan hath broke his Reed, Tell all your flocks 'tis Joviall Dovers ded. Behold the shepherds in their ribbands go, And shortly all the Nymphs shall wear 'em to: Amaz'd to see such glory met together, Blesse Dovers pipe, whose Musick call'd 'em hither. Sport you my Rams at sound of Dovers name; Big-bellied Ews make hast to bring a Lamb For Dovers fold: Go Maids and Lillies get To make him up a glorious Coronet. Swains keep his holy-day, and each man swear To Saint him in the Shepheards-Calender. The Song of Orpheus. Haile sacred Deserts, whom kind nature made Only to shelter with a loving shade, The now neglected Musick, glad to see Lions afford her hospitality. And Tygers bid her welcome, with the rest Of savage beasts accept her for a guest, Since men refuse her, and scarce daign an eare To her high notes, or if they please to heare, 'Tis all; amongst my Pupills, you may see The birds that learn't their sweetest layes of me; Those that chant Carols in this thanklesse age To pleasure men, rewarded with a Cage. A Maske for Lydia. Sweet Lydia take this Maske, and shroud Thy face within thy silken cloud, And veil those powerfull Skies: For he whose gazing dares so high aspire, Makes burning-glasses of his eyes, And sets his heart on fire. Vaile, Lydia, vaile, for unto me There is no Basilisk but thee, Thy very looks do kill: Yet in those looks so fixt is my delight, Poor soule (alas) I languish still In absence of thy sight. Close up those eyes or we shall finde Too great a lustre strikes us blind! Or if a ray so good Ought to be seen, let it but then appear When Eagles do produce their brood, To try their young ones there. Or if thou would'st have me to know How great a brightnesse thou canst show, VVhen they have lost the Sun; Then do thou rise, and give the world this theme, Sol from th' Hesperides is run, And back hath whipt his teame. Yet through the Goat when he shall stray, Thou through the Crab must take thy way; For should you both shine bright In the same Tropick, we poor moles should get Not so much comfort by the light, As torment by the heat. VVhere's Lydia now? where shall I seek Her charming lip, her tempting cheek That my affections bow'd? So dark a sable hath eclipst my fair, That I can gaze upon the cloud, That durst not see the star. But yet me thinks my thoughts begin To say there lyes a white within, Though black her pride controule And what care I how black a face I see, So there be whitenesse in the soule, Still such an Ethiope be. A parley with his empty Purse. Purse who I not know you have a Poet been When he shall look and find no gold herein? What respect (think you) will there now be shown To this foule nest, when all the birds are flown? Unnaturall vacuum, can your emptinesse Answer to some slight questions such as these? How shall my debts be paid? or can my scores Be cleer'd with Verses to my Creditors? Hexamiter's no sterling, and I tear What the brain coins goes scarce for currant there. Can meeter cancell bonds? Is here a time Ever to hope to wipe out chalk with rime? Or if I were now hurrying to the jail Are the nine Muses held sufficient bail? Would they to any composition come, If we should morgage our Elisium, Tempe, Pernassus, and the golden streams Of Tagus, and Pactolus, those rich dreams Of active fancy? Can our Orpheus move Those rocks, and stones with his best strains of love? Should I (like Homer) sing in lofty tones To them Achylles, and his Myrmidons! Hector, and Ajax are but Sergeants names, They relish Bay-salt 'bove the Epigrams Of the most season'd brain, nor will they be Content with Ode, or paid with Elegy. Muse, burn thy Baies, and thy fond quill resigne, One crosse of theirs is worth whole books of mine. Of all the treasure which the Poets hold There's none at all they weigh, except our gold; And mine's return'd to th'indies, and hath swore Never to visit this cold climate more. Then crack your strings good Purse, for you need none; Gape on, as they do to bepayd, gape on. Upon love fondly refus'd for conscience sake. Nature, Creations law, is judg'd by sense, Not by the Tyrant conscience, Then our commission gives us leave to do, What youth and pleasure prompts us to: For we must question, else heavens great decree, And tax it with a treachery; If things made sweet to tempt our appetite Should with a guilt stain the delight. Higher powers rule us, our selves can nothing do; Who made us love, made'lawfull too. It was not love, but love transform'd to vice Ravish'd with envious Avarice, Made women first impropriate; All were free, Inclosures mens inventions be. I'th golden age no action could be found For trespasse on my neighbours ground: Twas just with any Fair to mix our blood; The best is most diffusive good. She that confines her beams to one mans sight, Is a dark-Lanthorn to a glorious light. Say, does the Virgin-spring lesse chast appeare Cause many thirsts are quenched there? Or have you not with the same odours met, When more have smelt your Violet? The Phoenix is not angry at her nest, Cause her perfumes make others blest: Though Incense to th'eternall gods be meant, Yet mortals Rivall in the sent. Man is the Lord of Creatures, yet we see That all his vassals loves are free. The severe wedlocks fetters do not binde The Pard's inflam'd, and amorous mind; But that he may be like a Bridegroom led Even to the Royall Lions bed. The birds may for a yeer their loves confine, But make new choise each Valentine. If our affections then more servile be Then are our slaves, wher's mans soveraignty? Why then by pleasing more, should you lesse please, And spare the sweets, being more sweet then these? If the fresh Trunk have sap enough to give That each insertive branch may live; The Gardner grafts not only Apples there, But adds the VVarden and the Peare, The Peach, and Apricock together grow, The Cherrie and the Damson too, Till he hath made by skilfull husbandry An intire Orchard of one tree So lest our Paradise perfection want, VVe may as well inoculate as plant. What's Conscience but a Beldams midnight theam? Or nodding Nurses idle dream? So feign'd, as are the Goblins, Elves, and Fairies, To watch their Orchards, and their Daries. For who can tell when first her reign begun? I'th' state of innocence was none: And since large Conscience (as the proverb shewes) In the same sense with bad one goes, The lesse the better then, whence this will fall, 'Tis to be perfect to have none at all. Suppose it be a vertue rich, and pure, 'Tis not for Spring, or Summer sure, Nor yet for Autumn? Love must have his prime, His warmer hearts, and harvest time. Till we have flourish'd, grown, and reap'd our wishes; What Conscience dares oppose our kisses? But when times colder hand leads us near home, Then let that winter vertue come: Frost is all then prodigious, we may do What youth and pleasure prompts us to. On Importunate Dunnes. Pox take you all, from you my sorrwes swell Your treacherous Faith makes me turn Infidell. Pray vex me not for Heavens sake, or rather For your poor Childrens sake, or for your Father. You trouble me in vain, what e're you say I cannot, will not, nay I ought not pay, You are Extortioners, I was not sent T'encrease your sins, but make you all repent That e're you trusted me, wee're even here, I bought too cheap, because you sold too dear. Learn Conscience of your VVives, for they I swear For the most part trade in the better ware. Heark Reader if thou never yet hadst one I'le shew the torments of a Cambridge Dun. He railes where e're he comes, and yet can say But this, that Randolph did not keep his day. VVhat? can I keep the Day, or stop the Sun From setting, or the Night from coming on. Could I have kept dayes, I had chang'd the doom Of Times and Seasons that had never come. These evill spirits haunt me every day And will not let me eat, study, or pray. I am so much in their Books that 'tis known I am too seldome frequent in my owne. VVhat damage given to my Doors might be If Doors might Actions have of Battery! And when they find their comming to no end They Dunne by proxie, and their Letters send, In such a stile as I could never finde In Tullies long, or Seneca's short wind. Good Master Randolph, Pardon me I pray If I remember you forget your day. I kindly dealt with you, and it would be Unkind in you, not to be kind to me. You know Sir, I must pay for what I have, My Creditors will be paid, therefore I crave Pay me as I pay them Sir, for one Brother Is bound in Conscience to pay another. Besides, my Landlord would not be content, If I should dodge with him for's quarters rent. My Wife lies in too, and I needs must pay The Midwife, lest the fool be cast away. And 'tis a second charge to me poor man To make the new born Babe a Christian. Besies the Churching a third charge will be In butter'd Haberdine &amp; frummely. Thus hoping you will make a courteous end, I rest (I would thou would'st) Your loving Friend. A.B.M H.T.B.H.L.I.O. I.F.M.G.P.VV. Nay I know You have the same stile all, and as for me Such as your stile is shall your payment be. Just all alike, see, what a cursed spell Charms Devils up, to make my Chamber hell. This some starv'd Prentice brings, one that does look With a face blurd more then her Masters book. One that in any chink can peeping lye More slender then the yard he measures by: When my poor stomack barks for meat, I dare Scarce humour it, they make me live by ayr, As the Camelions do; and if none pay Better then I have done, even so may they. When I would go to Chappell, they betray My zeal, and when I only meant to pray Unto my God, faith all I have to do Is to pray them, and glad they'l hear me too. Nay should I preach, the Rascals are so vext, They'd fee a Beadle to arrest my Text; And sue it such a sute might granted be; My Use and Doctrine to an Outlawry. This stings, yet what my gall most works upon Is that the hope of my revenge is gone. For were I but to deal with such as those, That knew the danger of my Verse or Prose I'de steep my Muse in Vineger and Gall Till the fierce scold grew sharp and hangd 'um all. But those I am to deal with are so dull. (Though got by Schollers) he that is most full Of understanding can but hither come Imprimis, Item, and the totall-sum. I do not wish them Egypts plagues, but even As bad as they; I'de add unto them seven. I wish not Grashoppers, Frogs, and Lice come down, But clouds of Moths in every shop i'th Tran. Then honest Devill to their Ink convey Some Aqua-fortis that may eat away Their books. To adde more torments to their lives Heaven I beseech thee send 'um handsome Wives. Such as will pox their flesh till sores grow in't That all their linnen may be spent in lint, And give them Children with ingenuous faces, Indued with all the Ornaments and Graces Of Soule and Body, that it may be known To others, and themselves they'r not their own. And if this vex 'um not, I'le grieve the Town With this curse, States put Trinity-Lecture down: But my last Imprecation this shall be, May they more debtors have, and like me. Aulico-politico Academico. A Character. Thou Cozen to great Madams and allyed, To all the Beauties that are Ladified, Thou Eagle of the Realm whose eyes can see, Th'invisible plots of forraign policie, Thou great and unknown Learning of the Nation Made not by study, but by inspiration! The Court, the State, the Schools together be By th'ears, and fight, and scratch, and all for thee. When I behold thee cringe in some faire Hall, And scrape proportions Mathematicall, Varying thy mouth as 'twere by Magick-spell To circle, ovall, square, and triangle, And take a Virgin by the Ivory hand Minting words to her, none can understand But in a vision, and some verse repeat So wellinchanted, none the sense can get, Till they have conjur'd in lines strange and many, To find what spirit it has, if it have any. To see thy feet (though nature made them splay) Screw in the toes to dance and force away To some smooth measure, as might justly vaunt Thou art turn'd Monsieur of an Elephant. Thy mother sure going to see some sport, Tilting, or Masque, conceav'd thee in the Court. But when I view thee gravely nod, and spit In a grave posture, shake the head, and fit Plots to bring Spain to England, and confine King Philips Indies unto Middletons Mine. When I read o're thy Comments sagely writ On the Currantoes, and with how much wit Thy profound Aphorismes do expound to us The Almanacks, and Gallobelgious; When I conceive what news thou wilt bring o're When thou return'st with thy Embassador, VVhat flops the Switzers wears to hide his joynts, How French, and how the Spanyard trusse their points, How ropes of Onions at Saint Omers goe, And whether Turks be Christians, yea or no. Then I believe one in deep points so able, VVas surely got under the Councell-table. But when I heare thee of Celarent write In Ferio, and Baralypton fight. Methinks my then Prophetick soule durst tell Thou must be born at Aristotles VVell. But shall I tell thee friend how thy blest fate By chance hath made thy name so fortunate The State-man thinks thou hast too much oth' Court, The Courtier thinks thy sager parts do sort Best for the State; as for the Ladies they Pos'd with the Medley of the language, say Th'art a meer Scholler, and the Scholler swears Thou art of any tribe rather then then theirs. One thinks thee this, one that, a third thinks either, Thou thinkst thy self th'art all, and I think neither. On the losse of his finger. How much more blest are trees then men? Their boughes lopt off will grow agen; But if the steel our limbs dissever, The joynt once lost is lost for ever. But fondly I dull fool complain, Our members shall revive again. And thou poor finger that art dust Before the other members, must Return as soon as hevens command, And reunited be to'th hand As those that are not ashes yet, VVhy dost thou then so envious sit, And malice Oaks that they to fate Are tenants of a longer date? Their leases do more years include But once expir'd, are nere renew'd. Therefore deare finger though thou be Cut from those muscles govern'd thee, And had thy motion at command, Yet still as in a margent stand, To point my thoughts to fix upon The hope of Resurrection: And since thou canst no finger be Be a deaths head to humble me, Till death doth threat her sting in vain. And we in heaven shake hands again. A paranicon to the truly noble Gentleman M. Endymion Porter. Goe bashfull Muse, thy message is to one That drinks and fils thy Helicon. Who when his quill a sportive number seeks, Plants Roses in the Ladies cheeks. And with a sad note from their eyes can call Pearl-showers to dew those buds withall, Whose layes when I by chance am blest to heare My soule climbs up into mine eare, And bids your sisters challenge from the Moon The Learned, as the fair Endymion. Sing of his faith to the bright soule that's fled, And left you all poor girls struck dead With just despair of any future men T'employ, or to reward a Pen. A soul that staying would have wonders wrought, High as himselfe, or his great thought, And full of dayes, and honours, (with our prayer In stead of Beads summ'd up with tears.) Might of her own free flight to heaven have gone, Offer what's heart, his hand, his sword had done, But sing not thou a tale of discontent To him whose joy is to lament. We ought to pay true tears upon the hearse, And lay some up in faithfull verse, And so cast off our black; for more then thus Troubles the saints for troubling us. Say to him Cupid being once too kind Wept out his eyes and so grew blind. For dead Adonis, grief being paid her due He turn'd Loves wanton god, and so do you. To a painted Mistriss. There are who know what once to day it was; Your eyes, your Conscience, and your morning glasse, How durst you venture that adulterate part Be labour'd with your Fucus, and best Art To the rude breath of every rash salute? What did your profer whisper? expect suit? You were too plyant with your eare, vno wisht Pomatum and Vermilion might be kiss'd, That lip, that cheek by man was never known, Those favours you bestow are not your own. Henceforth such kisses I'le defie, like thee, Which druggists sell to you, and you to me. Upon an Hermaphrodite. Sir, or Madam, choose you whether, Nature twists you both together. And makes thy soul to each confesse, Both petticoat and breeches dresse. Thus we chastise the god of Wine, VVith water that is feminine. Till the cooler Nimph abate, His wrath, and so incorporate, Adam till his rib was lost Had the sexes thus ingrost, VVhen providence our Sire did cleave, And out of Adam carved Eve. Then did man 'bout wedlock treat To make his body up compleat. Thus Matrimony speaks hut thee In a grave solemnity; For Man and VVife make but one right Canonicall Hermaphrodite. Ravell thy body, and I finde In every limb a double kind, VVho would not think that head a pair, That breeds such factions in the hair? One halfe's so churlish in the touch, That rather then endure so much I would my tender limbs apparell VVith Regulus his nailed barrell. And the other halfe so small, And so amorous with all, That Cupid thinks each hair to grow, A string for his invisible Bow. VVhen I look babies in thine eyes, Here Venus, there Adonis lies. And though thy beauty be high noon, Thy Orbs contain both Sun and Moon. How many melting kisses skip, Betwixt thy Male and Female lip, Betwixt thy upper brush of hair, And thy nether beards despair? VVhen thou speak'st (I would not wrong) Thy sweetnesse with a double tongue) But in every simple sound A perfect Dialogue is found. Thy breasts distinguish one another, This is the sister, that the brother. when thou joyn'st hands my ears struck, fancies The nuptiall sound, I John take Frances. Feel but the difference, soft and rough, This is a gauntlet, that a muffe. Had fly Vlisses at the sack Of Troy, brought thee his Pedlers-pack And weapon too, to know Achilles From King Nicomodes Phillis. His plot had fail'd; this hand would feel The needle, that, the warlike steel. VVhen musick doth thy pace advance Thy right leg takes thy left to dance. Nor is't a Galliard danc'd by one But a mixt dance although alone. Thus every Heteroclite part Changes gender, but the heart. And those which modesty can meane (And dare not speak) are Epicene. That Gamester needs must overcome That can play both Tyb and Tom. Thus did natures Mintage vary, Coyning thee both Philip and Mary. To his Wel Timbred Mistris. Sweet, heard you not fames latest breath rehearse How I left hewing blocks to hack a Verse, Now grown the Master-Log, while others be But shavings ane the chips of Poetry. And thus I Saw Deal-boerds of beauty forth, To make my Love a Ware-house of her worth. Her legs are heart of Oak, and columns stand To bear the amorous bulk; then Muse command That Beech be work'd for thighes unto those legs, Turn'd round and carv'd, and joyned fast with pegs. Contrive her belly round, a dining room, When Love and Beauty will a feasting come, Another story make from wast to chin With breasts like Pots to nest young sparrows in, Then place the Garret of her head above, Thatcht with a yellow hair to keep in Love. Thus have I finish'd Beauties master prize Were but the Glasier neer to make her eyes. Then Muse her out-work cease to raise To work within, and wainscot her with praise. On six maids bathing themselves in a River. When bashfull Day-light now was gone, And Night that hides a blush eame on. Six pretty Nymphs to wash away The sweating of a summers-day, In Chams fair streams did gently swim And naked bathe each curious limb. O who had this blest sight but seen Would think that they had Clœlia's been. A Scholler that a walk did take (Perchance for meditation sake) This better object chanc'd to finde, Streight all things else were out of minde; What sitter study in this life. For Practick or Contemplative. He thought poor soul what he had seen Dyana and her Nymphs had been, And therefore thought in piteous fear Acteons fortunes had been near. Or that the water Nymphs they were Together met to sport them there. And that to him such love they bore As unto Hilas once before. What could he think but that his eye Six Nymphs at once did there espie Rise from the waves? Or that perchance Fresh-water Syrens came to dance Upon the stream with tongue and look To tempt poor Schollers from their book? He could not think they Graces were Because their numbers doubled are. Nor can he think they Muses be Because (alas) there wanted three. I should have rather guest that there Another brood of Helens were. The maids betrai'd were in a fright And blusht, but 'twas not seen by night. At last all by the bank did stand, And he (kind heart) lent them his hand. VVhere 'twas his blisse to feel all o're Soft paps, smooth thighes, and something more. But envious night hid from his eyes The place where love and pleasure lies. Guesse lovers guesse, guesse you that dare VVhat then might be this Schollers prayer. That he had been a Cat to spy, Or had he now Tiberius eye. Yet since his wishes were in vain He helpt them d'on their cloaths again, Makes promise there should none be shent, So with them to the Tavern went. How they all night did sport and play Pardon my Muse, I dare not say, Guesse you that have a mind to know VVhether he were a foole or no. The Wedding Morne. Arise, come forth, but never to return To the same Center, 'tis thy virgin Urn, Bury in it those thoughts you did possesse Thee from thy Cradle, till this happinesse; VVhich but to think upon will make thy cheek, Fairer then is the Morn you so much seek In beauty to outvy; and be the pride Of all that ever had the name of bride. Up Maids and let your nimble fingers be True instruments of curiosity: Set not a pin amisse, nor let a pleat Be folded in her gown but what's in state. And when her Ivory-temples you would deck Forbear your Art, for Nature gives you check, There in the circuit of her radient haire See Cupid fetter'd in a golden snare. Mark the triumphant throne wherein the Boy Installed sits to give the Bridegroom joy. But when she's drest, and that her listning ear Is welcom'd by the Bridegrooms being neer, Look how he stands, and how her stedfast eye Is fix'd on him at's first discovery. Both being met, mark how their souls do strive To be in eithers joy contemplative. VVhose kisses raise betwixt them such a fire That should the Phoenix see, he to expire VVould shun the spicy mountain, and so take Himself between their lips a grave to make. In praise of women in Generall. He is a Paricide to his mothers name, And with an impious hand murthers her fame, That wrongs the praise of women, that dares write Libels on Saints, or with foule ink requite The milk they lent us; better Sex command To your defence my more religious hand At sword, or Pen; ours is the nobler birth, For you of man were made, man but of earth, The son of dust; and though your sin did breed His fall, again you rais'd him in your seed: Adam in's sleep a gainfull losse sustain'd That for one rib a better self regain'd. VVho had he not your blest creation seen, An Anchorite in Paradise had been Why in this work did the creation rest But that eternall providence thought you best Of all his six dayes labour: beasts should do Homage to man, but man should wait on you. You are of comlier sight, of daintier touch, A tender flesh, a colour bright, and such As Parians see in marble, skin more fair, More glorious head, and far more glorious hair, Eyes full of grace, and quicknesse, purer roses Blush in your cheeks, a milder white composes Your stately fronts, your breath more sweet then his Breaths spice, and Nectar drops at every kisse. Your skins are smooth, brisles on theirs do grow Like quills of Porcupines, rough wool doth flow O're all their faces, you approach more near The form of angels, they like beasts appear: If then in bodies where the souls do dwell You better us, do then our souls excell? No; we in souls equall perfection see There can in them nor male nor female be. Boast we of knowledg? You have more then we You were the first ventur'd to pluck the tree, And that more Rhetorick in your tongues doth lye Let him dispute against that dares deny Your least commands, and not perswaded be With Sampsons strength, and Davids piety, To be your willing Captives; vertue sure Were blind as fortune, should shee choose the poore Rough cottage man to live in, and despise To dwell in you the stately edifice. Thus you are prov'd the better sex, and we Must all repent that in our Pedigre. We chose the fathers name, where should we take The mothers, a more honour'd blood, 'twould make Our generation sure, and certain be, And I'de believe some faith in Heraldry! Thus perfect Creatures if detraction rise Against your sex dispute but with your eyes, Your hand, your lip, your brow, there will be sent So subtile and so strong an argument Will teach the Stoick his affection too, And call the Cinick from his Tub to woo. Thus mustring up your beauteous troops, go on The fairest is the valiant Amazon. To M.I. S. on his gratefull Servant. I cannot fulminate or tonitruate words To puzzle intellects, my ninth lasse affords No Lycophronian buskins, nor can strain Garaganturne lines to Gigantize thy vein, Nor make a jusjur and, that thy great plaies Are terr'del fo-gos, or incognitaes, Thy Pegasus in his admir'd career, Curvets no Capreols of Nonsence here. Wonder not friend, that I do entertain Such language, that both think &amp; speak so plain. Know, I applaud thy smooth and even strains, That will inform, and not confound our brains. Thy Helicon, like a smooth stream doth flow, VVhile others with disturbed channels go, And headlong, like Niles Cataracts do fall VVith a huge noyse, and yet not heard at all. VVhen thy intelligence on the Cock-pit stage Gives it a soule from the immortall rage. I heare the Muses birds with full delight Sing where the birds of Mars were wont to fight: Nor flatter I, thou knowest I do abhor it; Let others praise thy Play, I'le love thee for it; That he that knows my friend shall say, he has A friend as Gratefull as his servant was. FINIS. Amyntas. Pilumnus Epilogizes. All Loves are happy, none with us there be, Now sicke of coynesse, or unconstancy. The wealthy summes of kisses doe amount To greater scores then curious art can count! Each eye is fixt upon his Mistris face, And every Arme is lockt in some embrace: Each cheek is dimpled; every lip doth smile: Such happinesse I wish this blessed Isle, This little world of Lovers: and lest you Should thinke this blisse no reall joyes nor true, Would every Lady in this orbe might see Their loves as happy, as we say they be! And for your gentle youths, whose tender hearts Are not shot-proofe gainst love and Cupids darts; These are my Prayers (I would those prayers were charms) That each had here his Mistresse in his armes. True Lovers (for tis truth gives love delight) To you our Author onely meanes to write. If he have pleas'd) as yet he doubtfull stands) For his applause clap lips instead of Hands. He begs nor Bayes, nor Ivy; onely this, Seale his wisht Plaudite with an amorous Kisse. Exeunt Cantantes. FINIS. ARISTIPPVS, OR, THE IOVIALL PHILOSOPHER. Presented in a private Shew, The verse has been extracted from prose text. Omnis Aristippum decuit color, &amp; status &amp; res. Semel insanivimus. The Præludium Shewes having beene long intermitted, and forbidden by authority for their abuses, could not be raised but by conjuring. Enter Prologue in a Circle. Be not deceiv'd, I have no bended knees No supple tongue nor speeches steep'd in Oyle, No candied flattery, nor honied words, I come an armed Prologue: arm'd with arts, Who by my sacred charms and mystick skill, By vertue of this all commanding VVand Stolne from the sleepy Mercury, will raise From black Abisse and sooty hell, that mirth Which fits this long dead round. Thou long-dead Show, Breake from thy Marble prison, sleep no more In myrie darkenesse, henceforth I forbid thee To bathe in Lethe's muddy waves, ascend As bright as morning from her Tithons bed, And red with kisses that have stain'd thy cheeke, Grow fresh again: what? is my power contemned? Dost thou not heare my call, whose power extends To blast the bosome of our mother Earth? To remove heavens whole frame from of her hinges, As to reverse all Natures lawes? Ascend, Or I will call a band of Furies foorth. And all the torments wit of hell can frame Shall force thee up. Enter Show whipt by two Furies. Show. O spare your two officious whips a while, Give some small respit to my panting limbs. Let me have leave to speak, and truce to parlie, Whose powerfull voyce hath forc't me to salute This hated ayre! are not my paines sufficient, But you must torture me with the sad remembrance Of my deserts, the Causes of my exile? Prolog. This thy release I seeke, I come to file Those heavy shackles from thy wearied limbs, And give the leave to walke the Stage again, As free as vertue: Burne thy withered Bayes, And with fresh Laurell crowne thy sacred Temples, Cast off thy maske of darkenesse; and appeare As glorious as thy sister Comedy. But first with teares wash off that guilty sinne, Purge out those ill digested dregges of wit, That use their inke to blot a spotlesse fame, Let's have no one particular man traduc'd, But like a noble Eagle seaze on vice, As she flyes bold and open, spare the persons, Let us have simple mirth, and innocent laughter; Sweet smiling lips and such as hide no fangs, No venemous biting teeth, or forked tongues. Then shall thy freedome be restor'd again, And full applause be wages of thy paine. Show. Then from the depth of truth I here protest, I doe disclaime all petulant hate and malice, I will not touch such men as I know vicious, Much lesse the good: I will not dare to say, That such a one pay'd for his fellowship, And had no learning but in's purse; no Officer Need feare the sting of my detraction, I'le give all leave to fill their guts in quiet: I make no dangerous Almanacks, no gulls, No Posts with envious News and biting Packets, You need not feare this Show, you that are bad, It is no Parliament: you that nothing have Like Schollars, but a Beard and Gowne, for me May passe for good grand Sophies: all my skill Shall beg but honest laughter and such smiles As might become a Cato: I shall give No cause to grieve that once more yet I live. Prolog. Goe then and you Beagles of hell avant, Returne to your eternall plagues. Exeunt Furies. Prolog. Here take these purer robes, and clad in these, Be thou all glorious and instruct thy mirth With thy sweet temper, whilst my selfe intreate Thy friends that long lamented thy sad fates, To sit and taste, and to accept thy Cates. Exit Show. Prolog. Sir, see, and heare, and censure he that will, I come to have my mirth approv'd, not Skill: Your laughter all I begge, and where you see No jest worth laughing at, faith laugh at me. ARISTIPPUS Enter two Schollars. Slaves are they that heape up mountaines, Still desiring more and more, Still let's carouse in Bacchus fountaines, Never dreaming to be poore. Give us then a cup of liquor, Fill it up unto the brim, For then me thinks my wits grow quicker, When my braines in liquor swimme. 1. Schol. What ayles thou, thou musing man? Diddle diddle dooe. 2. Schol. Quench thy sorrowes in a Canne, Diddle diddle dooe. Aristippus: But come you Lads that love Canary, Let us have a mad segarie: Hether, hether, hether, hether, All good fellowes flocke together. Arist. I wish you all carefully, Drinke Sacke but sparingly, Spend your coyne thriftily, Keepe your health warily, Take heed of ebriety, Wine is an enemy, Good is sobriety, Fly baths and venery. 1 Schol. There is a drinke made of the Stygian Lake, Or else of the waters the Furies doe make, No name there is bad enough by which it to call, But yet as I wist, it is ycleped Ale; Men drinks it thick, and pisse it out thin, Mickle filth by Saint Loy that it leaves within, But I of complexion am wondrous sanguine, And will love by th' Marrow a cup of Wine, To live in delight was ever my wonne, For I was Epicurus his own sonne, That held opinion, that plainly delight Was very felicity perfite: A Bowle of Wine is wondrous ?boone? cheere To make one blythe, buxome, and deboneere, 'Twill give me such valour, and so much courage, As cannot be found 'twixt Hull and Carthage. 2 Schol. Fill me a Bowle of Sack with Roses crown'd. Fil't to the brim, I'l have my temples bound With flowry Chaplets, and this day permit My Genius to be free, and frolike it; Let me drinke deep, then fully warm'd with Wine I'l chaunt Æneas praise, that every line Shall prove immortall, till my moistned Quill Melt into Verses, and Nectar like distill; I'm sad, or dull, till Bowles brim-fil'd infuse New life in me, new spirit in my Muse: But once reviv'd with Sack, pleasing desires In my child hood kindle such active fires, That my gray haires seeme fled, my wrinkl'd face Growne smooth as Hebes, youth, and beæuties grace, To my shrunke veines, fresh blood and spirits bring, Warme as the Summer, sprightfull as the Spring; Then all the world is mine: Crœsus is poore, Compar'd with me, he is rich that askes no more: And I in Sack have all, which is to me My home, my life, health, wealth, and liberty, Then have I conquer'd all, I boldly dare My Trophies with the Pelean youth compare, Him I will equall, as his sword, my Pen My conquer'd world of cares, his world of men, Doe not Atrides, Nestors ten desire, But ten such drinkers as that aged sire, His streame of honied words flowed from the Wine, And Sack his Counsell was, as he was thine. Who euer purchast a rich Indian mine, But Bacchus first, and next the Spanish Wine? Then fill my bowle, that if I dye to morrow. Killing cares to day, I have out-liv'd my sorrow. Sim. Aristippus is better in every letter, Than Faber the Parisiensis. Then Scotus, Sencinas, and Thomas Aquinas, Or Gregory Gandavensis: Than Cardan and Ramus, than old Paludanus, Albertus and Gabriella, Than Pico Mercatus, or Scaliger Natus, Than Niphus or Zabarella, Hortado, Trombetus, were fooles with Toletus, Zanardus, and Will de Hales. With Occham, Iavellus, and mad Algazellus, Phyloponus, and Natalis; The Conciliatur was but a meere prater, And so was Apolinaris: Iandunus, Plotinus, the Dunce Eugubinus: With Mæsius, Savil, and Swarez, Fonseca, Durandus, Becanus, Holandus, Pererius, Avienture; Old Trisme gift us, whose Volumes have mist us. Ammonius, Bonaventure Mirandula, Comes, with Proclus and Somes, And Guido, the Carmelita: The nominall Schooles, and the Colledge of fooles, No longer is my delight a: Hang ?Beirewood? and Carter, in Crakenthorps Garter, Let Keckerman too bemoane us, Ile be no more beaten, for greasie Iacke Seaten, Or conning of Sandersonus. The censure of Cato's, shall never amate us, Their frosty beards cannot nip us: Your Ale is too muddy, good Sack is our study, Our Tutor is Aristippus. Aristip. We care not for money, riches, or wealth, Old Sack is our mony, old Sack is our health, Then let's flocke hither Like birds of a feather, To drinke, to fling, To laugh and sing, Conferring our notes together, Conferring our notes together. Come let us laugh, let us drinke, let us sing, The Winter with us is as good as the Spring, We care not a feather For wind, or for weather, But night and day We sport and play, Conferring our notes together Conferring our notes together. FINIS. THE PEDLER, AS It was presented in a strange SHOW. The verse has been extracted from prose text. I am a Pedler, and I sell my ware This brave Saint Barthol, or Sturbridge Faire, I'l sell all for laughter, that's all my gaines, Such Chapmen should be laught at for their paines. Come buy my wits which I have hither brought, For wit is never good till it be bought; Let me not beare all backe, buy some the while, If laughter be too deare, tak't for a smile; My trade is jesting now, or quible speaking, Strange trade you'l say, for it's set up with breaking? My Shop and I, am all at your command, For lawfull English laughter paid at hand, Now will I trust no more, it were in vaine To breake, and make a Craddocke of my braine: Halfe have not paid me yet, first there is one Owes me a quart for his declamation, Anothers morning draught, is not yet paid For foure Epistles at the election made, Nor dare I crosse him who do's owe as yet Three ells of jests to line Priorums wit. But here's a Courtier has so long a bill, 'Twill fright him to behold it, yet I will Relate the summes: Item, he owes me first, For an Imprimis: but what grieves me worst, A dainty Epigram on his Spaniels taile Cost me an houre, besides five pots of Ale. Item an Anagram on his Mistris name, Item the speech wherewith he courts his Dame, And an old blubbur'd scowling Elegy Vpon his Masters Dogs sad exequy, Nor can I yet the time exactly gather, When I was payd for an Epytaph on's Father, Besides he never yet gave me content For the new coyning of's last Complement, Should I speake all' b'es spoken to his praise, The totall summe is, what he think, or sayes, I will not let you runne so much o'th'score, Poore Duck-Lane braines, trust me, I'l trust no more; Shall's jest for nought, have you all conscience lost? Or do you think our Sacke did nothing cost? Well, then it must be done as I have said, I needes must be with present laughter paid: I am a free man, for by this sweet Rhyme, The fellowes know I have secur'd the time; Yet if you please to grace my poore adventures, I'm bound to you in more than ten Indentures. Who will not pitty Points, when each man sees To begging they are fallen upon their knees? Though I beg pitty, think I doe not feare Censuring Criticke whelps, no point Mounsier: If you hate Points, and these like merry speeches, You may want Points for to trusse up your Breeches. And from the close-stoole may he never move, What hating Points, doth clasps and keepers love; But if my Points have here at all offended, Ile tell you a way boy how all may be amended: Speak to the Point, and that shall answer friend, All is not worth a point, and there's an end. If any this Looking-Glasse disgrace, It is because he dares not see his face: Then what I am, I will not see (faith) say, 'Twas the whores Argument, when she threw't away. Come buy my braines, you ignorane Gulls, And furnish here your empty sculls; Pay you laughter, as it's fit, To the learned Pedlar of wit: Quickly come, and quickly buy, Or I'l shut my Shop, and fooles you'l dye If your Concomes you would quoddle, Here buy Braines to fill your noddle. Who buyes my braines, learnes quickly here To make a Probleme in a yeere; Shall understand the predicable, And the predicamentall Rabble: Who buyes them not, shall die a foole; An exotericke in the Schoole: Who has not these, shall ever passe For a great Acromaticall Asse: Buy then this Box of Braines; who buyes not it, Shall never surfet on too much wit. Come from thy Pallace, beauteous Queen of Greece, Sweet Hellen of the world, rise like the morne, Clad in the smocke of night, that all the stars May lose their eyes, and then grow blinde, Runne weeping to the man i'th' Moone, To borrow his Dogge to leade the Spheares a begging. Rare Empresse of our souls, whose Charcoale flames Burne the poore Colts foot of amazed hearts. Uiew the dumbe Audience thy beauty spyes, And then amaz'd with friefe, laugh out their eyes. Faire Madame, thee whose every thing Deserves the Close-stoole of a King: Whose head is faire as any bone, White and smooth as Pumice stone, Whose naturall baldnesse scornes to weare The needlesse excrements of haire, Whose fore-head streakes, our hearts commands, Like Dover Cliffs, or Goodwyn sands. While from those dainty Glo-worme eyes, Cupid shoots Plum pudding Pyes, While from the Arches of thy nose, A Creame-pot of white Nectar flowes. Faire dainty lips, so smooth, so sleeke, And truly Alabaster cheeke. Pure Saffron teeth, happy the meate That such pretty milnestones eàte. O let me heare some silent Song, Tun'd by the Iewes-Trumpe of thy tongue. Oh, how that Chin becomes thee well, Where never hairy Beard shall dwell; Thy Corall meke doth statlier bow, Than Ios, when she turn'd a Cow: O let me, or I shall ne'r rest, Sucke the blacke bottles of thy brest; Or lay my head, and rest me still On that dainty Hog magog hill. Oh curious, and unfathom'd Waste, As slender as the stateliest Mast: Thy fingers too breed my delight, Each Wart a naturall Margarite. Oh pitty then my dismall moane, Able to melt thy heart of Stone. Thou know'st how I lament and howle, Weepe, snort, condole, looke sad and scowle: Each night so great, my passions be, I cannot wake for thought of thee. Thy Gowne can tell how much I lov'd, Thy Petticoate to pitty moov'd. Then let thy Pedler mercy finde, To kisse thee once though it be behinde. Sweet kisse, sweet lips, delicious sense, How sweet a Zephyrus blowes from thence; Blest petticoat, more blest her Smocke, That daily busseth her Buttocke: For now the Proverbe true I finde, That the best part is still behind. Sweet dainty soule, daigne but to give The poore Pedler this hanging sleeve. And in thine honour, by this kisse, Ile daily weare my Packe in this And quickly so beare thee more fame, Than Quixot the Knight Errants Dame: So farewell sweet, daigne but to touch, And once againe re-blesse my Pouch. The Pedler calls for his Coltstaffe. Some friend must now perforce Make haste, and bid my Boy To saddle me my woodden Horse, For I meane to conquer Troy. FINIS.</field>
