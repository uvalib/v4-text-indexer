      <field name="fulltext">This was for youth, Strength, Mirth, and wit that Time Most count their golden Age; but t'was not thine Thine was thy later yeares, so much refind From youths Drosse, Mirth, &amp; wit; as thy pure mind Thought (like the Angels) nothing but the Praise Of thy Creator, in those last, best Dayes. Witnes this Booke, (thy Embleme) which begins With Love; but endes, with Sighes, &amp; Teares for sins. IZ: WA:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hexastichon Bibliopolæ. I See in his last preach'd, and printed booke, His Picture in a sheete; in Pauls I looke, And see his Statue in a sheete of stone, And sure his body in the grave hath one: Those sheetes present him dead, these if you buy, You have him living to Eternity. Jo. Mar. THE PROGRESSE OF THE SOULE. First Song. I I sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule, Whom Fate, which God made, but doth not controule, Plac'd in most shapes; all times before the law Yoak'd us, and when, and since, in this I sing. And the great world to his aged evening; From infant morne, through manly noone I draw. What the gold Chaldee, or silver Persian saw, Greeke brasse, or Roman iron, is in this one; A worke t'outweare Seths pillars, bricke and stone, And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none. II Thee, eye of heaven, this great Soule envies not, By thy male force, is all wee have, begot, In the first east, thou now begins to shine, Suck'st early balme, and Iland spices there, And wilt anon in thy loose-rein'd careere At Tagus, Po, Sene, Thames, and Danon dine. And see at night thy Westerne land of mine, Yet hast thou not more nations seene then shee, That before thee, one day beganne to be, And thy fraile light being quench'd, shall long, long out live thee. III Nor holy Ianus in whose soveraigne boate The Church, and all the Monarchies did floate; That swimming Colledge, and free Hospitall Of all mankinde, that cage and vivarie, Of fowles, and beasts, in whose wombe, Destinie Us, and our latest nephewes did install (From thence are all deriv'd, that fill this All) Did'st thou in that great stewardship embarke So diverse shapes into that floating parke, As have beene moved, and inform'd by this heavenly sparke. IV Great Destiny the commissary of God, That hast mark'd out a path and period For everything, who, where wee of-spring tooke, Our wayes and ends seest at one instant. Thou Knot of all causes, thou whose changelesse brow Ne're smiles nor frownes, O vouch-safe thou to looke And shew my story, in thy eternall booke. That (if my prayer be fit) I may 'understand So much my selfe, as to know with what hand, How scant, or liberall this my lifes race is spand. V To my sixe lusters almost now outwore, Except thy booke owe mee so many more, Except my legend be free from the letts Of steepe ambition, sleepie povertie, Spirit-quenching sicknesse, dull captivitie, Distracting businesse, and from beauties nets, And all that calls from this, and to others whets, O let me not launch out, but let mee save Th'expence of braine and spirit; that my grave His right and due, a whole unwasted man may have. VI But if my dayes be long, and good enough, In vaine this sea shall enlarge, or enrough It selfe; for I will through the wave, and some, And shall in sad love wayes, a lively spright Make my darke heavy Poëm light, and light. For though through many streights, &amp; lands I roame, I launch at paradise, and I saile towards home; The course I there began, shall here be staid, Sailes hoised there, stroke here, and anchors laid In Thames, which were at Tigrys, and Euphrates waide. VII For the great soule which here amongst us now Doth dwell, and moves that hand, and tongue, &amp; brow, Which as the Moone the sea, moves us, to heare Whose story, with long patience you will long; (For 'tis the crowne, and last straine of my song) This soule to whom Luther, and Mahomet were Prisons of flesh; this soule which oft did teare, And mend the wracks of th'Empire, and late Rome, And liv'd when every great change did come, Had first in paradise, a low, but fatall roome. VIII Yet no low roome, nor then the greatest, lesse, If (as devout and sharpe men fitly guesse) That Crosse, our joy, and griefe, where nailes did tye That All, which alwayes was all, every where Which could not sinne, and yet all sinnes did beare; Which could not die, yet could not chuse but die; Stood in the selfe same roome in Calvarie, Where first grew the forbidden learned tree, For on that tree hung in security This Soule, made by the Makers will from pulling free. IX Prince of the orchard, faire as dawning morne, Fenc'd with the law, and ripe as soone as borne That apple grew, which this Soule did Till the then climing serpent, that now creeps For that offence, for which all mankinde weepes, Tooke it, and t'her whom the first man did wive (Whom and her race, only forbiddings drive) He gave it, she, t'her husband, both did eate; So perished the eaters, and the meate: And wee (for treason taints the blood) thence die and sweat. X Man all at once was there by woman slaine, And one by one we'are here slaine o'er againe By them. The mother poisoned the well-head, The daughters here corrupts us, No smalnesse scapes, no greatnesse breake their nets, She thrust us out, and by them we are led Astray, from turning, to whence we are fled, Were prisoners Judges, t'would seeme rigorous, Shee sinn'd, we here, part of our paine is, thus To love them, whose fault to this painfull love yoak'd us. XI So fast in us doth this corruption grow, That now wee dare aske why wee should be so, Would God (disputes the curious Rebell) make A law, and would not have it kept? Or can His creatures will, crosse his? Of every man For one, will God (and be just) vengeance take? Who sinn'd? t'was not forbidden to the snake Nor her, who was not then made; nor i'st writ That Adam cropt, or knew the apple; yet The worme and she, and he, and wee endure for it. XII But snatch mee heavenly Spirit, from this vaine Reckoning their vanities, lesse is their gaine Then hazard still, to meditate on ill, Though with good minde, their reasons like those toyes Of glassie bubles, with the gamesome boyes Stretch to so nice a thinnes through a quill That they themselves breake, doe themselves spill, Arguing is heretiques game, and Exercise As wrastlers, perfect them; Not liberties Of speech, but silence; hands, not tongues, end heresies. XIII Just in that instant when the serpents gripe, Broke the slight veines, and tender conduit-pipe, Through which this soule from the trees root did draw Life, and growth to this apple, fled away This loose soule, old, one and another day. As lightning, which one scarce dares say, he saw, 'Tis so soone gone, (and better proofe the law Of sense, then faith requires) swiftly she flew To a darke and foggie Plot; Her, her fates threw There through th'earth-pores, and in a Plant hous'd her a new. XIV The plant thus abled, to it selfe did force A place, where no place was; by natures course As aire from water, water fleets away From thicker bodies, by this root thronged so His spungie confines gave him place to grow, Just as in our streets, when the people stay To see the Prince, and so fill'd the way That weesels scarce could passe, when she comes nere They throng and cleave up, and a passage cleare, As if, for that time, their round bodies flatned were. XV His right arme he thrust out towards the East, West-ward his left; th'ends did themselves digest Into ten lesser strings, these fingers were: And as a slumberer stretching on his bed; This way he this, and that way scattered His other legge, which feet with toes upbeare; Grew on his middle parts, the first day, haire, To show, that in loves businesse hee should still A dealer bee, and be us'd well, or ill: His apples kinde, his leaves, force of conception kill. XVI A mouth, but dumbe, he hath; blinde eyes, deafe eares, And to his shoulders dangle subtile haires; A young Colossus there hee stands upright, And as that ground by him were conquered A leafie garland weares he on his head Enchas'd with little fruits, so red and bright That for them you would call your Loves lips white; So, of a lone unhaunted place possest, Did this soules second Inne, built by the guest This living buried man, this quiet mandrake, rest. XVII No lustfull woman came this plant to grieve, But t'was because there was none yet but Eve: And she (with other purpose) kill'd it quite; Her sinne had now brought in infirmities, And so her cradled child, the moist red eyes Had never shut, nor sleept since it saw light, Poppie she knew, she knew the mandrakes might; And tore up both, and so coold her childs blood; Unvirtuous weeds might long unvex'd have stood; But hee's short liv'd, that with his death can doe most good. XVIII To an unfetterd soules quick nimble hast Are falling stars, and hearts thoughts, but slow pac'd: Thinner then burnt aire flies this soule, and she Whom foure new comming, and foure parting Suns Had found, and left the Mandrakes tenant, runnes Thoughtlesse of change, when her firme destiny Confin'd, and enjayld her, that seem'd so free, Into a small blew shell, the which a poore Warme bird orespread, and sat still evermore, Till her uncloath'd child kickt, and pick'd it selfe adore. XIX Outcrept a sparrow, this soules moving Inne, On whose raw armes stiffe feathers now begin, As childrens teeth through gummes, to breake with paine, His flesh is jelly yet, and his bones threds, All downy a new mantle overspreads, A mouth he opes, which would as much containe As his late house, and the first houre speaks plaine, And chirps alowd for meat. Meat fit for men His father steales for him, and so feeds then One, that within a moneth, will beate him from his hen. XX In this worlds youth wise nature did make hast, Things ripened sooner, and did longer last; Already this hot cocke in bush and tree In field and tent oreflutters his next hen, He asks her not, who did so tast, nor when, Nor if his sister, or his neece shee be, Nor doth she pule for his inconstancie If in her sight he change, nor doth refuse The next that calls; both liberty doe use; Where store is of both kindes, both kindes may freely chuse. XXI Men, till they tooke laws which made freedome lesse, Their daughters, and their sisters did ingresse, Till now unlawfull, therefore ill; t'was not So jolly, that it can move this soule; Is The body so free of his kindnesses, That selfe preserving it hath now forgot, And slackneth so the soules, and bodies knot, Which t?perance streightens; freely on his she friends He blood, and spirit, pith, and marrow spends, Ill steward of himself, himselfe in three yeares ends. XXII Else might he long have liv'd; man did not know Of gummie blood, which doth in holly grow How to make bird-lime, nor how to deceive With faind calls, his nets, or enwrapping snare The free inhabitants of the Plyant aire. Man to beget, and woman to conceive Askt not of rootes, nor of cock-sparrowes, leave: Yet chuseth hee, though none of these he feares, Pleasantly three, then streightned twenty yeares To live, and to encrease, himselfe outweares. XXIII This cole with overblowing quench'd and dead, The Soule from her too active organs fled T'a brooke; a female fishes sandie Roe With the males jelly, newly lev'ned was, For they intertouched as they did passe, And one of those small bodies, fitted so, This soule inform'd, and abled it to roe It selfe with finnie oares, which she did fit, Her scales seem'd yet of parchment, and as yet Perchance a fish, but by no name you could call it. XXIV When goodly, like a ship in her full trim, A swan, so white that you may unto him Compare all whitenesse, but himselfe to none, Glided along, and as he glided watch'd, And with his arched necke this poore fish catch'd. It mov'd with state, as if to looke upon Low things it scorn'd, and yet before that one Could thinke he sought it, he had swallowed cleare This, and much such, and unblam'd devour'd there All, but who too swift, too great, or well arm'd were XXV Now swome a prison in a prison put, And now this Soule in double walls was shut, Till melted with the Swans digestive fire, She left her house the fish, and vapour'd forth; Fate not affording bodies of more worth For her as yet, bids her againe retire T'another fish, to any new desire Made a new prey; For, he that can to none Resistance make, nor complaint, sure is gone. Weaknesse invites, but silence feasts oppression. XXVI Pace with the native streame, this fish doth keepe, And journeyes with her, towards the glassie deepe, But oft retarded, once with a hidden net Though with great windowes, for when need first taught These tricks to catch food, th? they were not wrought As now, with curious greedinesse to let None scape, but few, and fit for use to get, As, in this trap a ravenous pike was tane, Who, though himselfe distrest, would faine have slain This wretch; So hardly are ill habits left again. XXVII Here by her smallnesse shee two deaths orepast, Once innocence scap'd, and left the oppressor fast; The net through-swome, she keepes the liquid path, And whether she leape up sometimes to breath And suck in aire, or finde it underneath, Or working parts like mills, or limbecks hath To make the wether thinne, and airelike faith Cares not, but safe the Place she's come unto Where fresh, with salt waves meet, and what to doe She knowes not, but betweene both makes a boord or two XXVIII So farre from hiding her guests, water is That she showes them in bigger quantities Then they are. Thus doubtfull of her way, For game and not for hunger a sea Pie Spied through this traiterous spectacle, from high, The seely fish where it disputing lay, And t'end her doubts and her, beares her away, Exalted she'is, but to the exalters good, As are by great ones, men which lowly stood. It's rais'd, to be the Raisers instrument and food. XXIX Is any kinde subject to rape like fish? Ill unto man, they neither doe, nor wish: Fishers they kill not, nor with noise awake, They doe not hunt, nor strive to make a prey Of beasts, nor their yong sonnes to beare away; Foules they pursue not, nor do undertake To spoile the nests industruous birds do make; Yet them all these unkinde kinds feed upon, To kill them is an occupation, And lawes make fasts, &amp; lents for their destruction. XXX A sudden stiffe land-winde in that selfe houre To sea-ward forc'd this bird, that did devour The fish; he cares not, for with ease he flies, Fat gluttonies best orator: at last So long hee hath flowen, and hath flowen so fast That leagues o'er-past at sea, now tir'd hee lyes, And with his prey, that till then languisht, dies, The soules no longer foes, two wayes did erre, The fish I follow, and keepe no calender Of the other; he lives yet in some great officer. XXXI Into an embrion fish, our Soule is throwne And in due time throwne out againe, and growne To such vastnesse, as if unmanacled From Greece, Morea were, and that by some Earthquake unrooted, loose Morea swome, Or seas from Africks body had severed And torne the hopefull Promontories head, This fish would seeme these, and, when all hopes faile, A great ship overset, or without saile Hulling, might (when this was a whelp) be like this whale. XXXII At every stroake his brazen finnes do take More circles in the broken sea they make Then cannons voices, when the aire they teare: His ribs are pillars, and his high arch'd roofe Of barke that blunts best steele, is thunder-proofe, Swimme in him swallowed Dolphins, without feare, And feele no sides, as if his vast wombe were Some Inland sea, and ever as hee went Hee spouted rivers up, as if he ment To joyne our seas, with seas above the firmament. XXXIII He hunts not fish, but as an officer, Stayes in his court, at his owne net, and there All suitors of all sorts themselves enthrall; So on his backe lyes this whale wantoning, And in his gulfe-like throat, sucks every thing That passeth neare. Fish chaseth fish, and all, Flyer and follower, in this whirlepoole fall; O might not states of more equality Consist? and is it of necessity That thousand guiltlesse smals, to make one great, must die? XXXIV Now drinkes he up seas, and he eates up flocks, He justles Ilands, and he shakes firme rockes. Now in a roomefull house this Soule doth float, And like a Prince she sends her faculties To all her limbes, distant as Provinces. The Sunne hath twenty times both crab and goate Parched, since first lanch'd forth this living boate. 'Tis greatest now, and to destruction Nearest; There's no pause at perfection. Greatnesse a period hath, but hath no station. XXXV Two little fishes whom hee never harm'd, Nor fed on their kinde, two not throughly arm'd With hope that they could kill him, nor could doe Good to themselves by his death: they did not eate His flesh, nor suck those oyles, which thence outstreat, Conspir'd against him, and it might undoe The plot of all, that the plotters were two, But that they fishes were, and could not speake. How shall a Tyran wise strong projects breake, If wreches can on them the common anger wreake? XXXVI The flaile-find Thresher, and steel-beak'd Sword-fish Onely attempt to doe, what all doe wish. The Thresher backs him, and to beate begins; The sluggard Whale yeelds to oppression, And t'hide himselfe from shame and danger, downe Begins to sinke; the Swordfish upward spins, And gores him with his beake; his staffe-like finnes, So were the one, his sword the other plyes, That now a scoffe, and prey, this tyran dyes, And (his owne dole) feeds with himselfe all companies. XXXVII Who will revenge his death? or who will call Those to account, that thought, and wrought his fall? The heires of slaine kings, wee see are often so Transported with the joy of what they get, That they, revenge, and obsequies forget, Nor will against such men the people goe, Because h'is now dead, to whom they should show Love in that act. Some kings by vice being growne So needy of subjects love, that of their own They thinke they lose, if love be to the dead Prince shown. XXXVIII This Soule, now free from prison, and passion, Hath yet a little indignation That so small hammers should so soone downe beat So great a castle. And having for her house Got the streight cloyster of a wreched mouse (As basest men that have not what to eate, Nor enjoy ought, doe farre more hate the great Then they, who good repos'd estates possesse) This Soule, late taught that great things might by lesse Be slain, to gallant mischiefe doth herselfe addresse. XXXIX Natures great master-peece, an Elephant, The onely harmlesse great thing; the giant Of beasts; who thought, no more had gone, to make one wise But to be just, and thankfull, loth to offend, (Yet nature hath given him no knees to bend) Himselfe he up-props, on himselfe relies And foe to none, suspects no enemies, Still sleeping stood; vex't not his fantasie Blacke dreames, like an unbent bow, carelesly His sinewy Proboscis did remisly lie. XL In which as in a gallery this mouse Walk'd, and surveid the roomes of this vast house, And to the braine, the soules bedchamber, went, And gnaw'd the life cords there; Like a whole towne Cleane undermin'd, the slaine beast tumbled downe, With him the murtherer dies whom envy sent To kill, not scape, for, only hee that ment To die, did ever kill a man of better roome, And thus he made his foe, his prey, and tombe: Who cares not to turn back, may any whither come. XLI Next, hous'd this Soule a Wolves yet unborne whelp, Till the best midwife, Nature, gave it helpe, To issue. It could kill, as soone as goe, Abel, as white, and milde as his sheepe were, (Who in that trade of Church, and kingdomes, there Was the first type) was still infested soe, With this wolfe, that it bred his losse and woe; And yet his bitch, his sentinell attends The flocke so neere, so well warnes and defends, That the wolfe, (hopelesse else) to corrupt her, intends. XLII Hee tooke a course, which since, succesfully, Great men have often taken, to espie The counsels, or to breake the plots of foes, To Abels tent he stealeth in the darke, On whose skirts the bitch slept; ere she could barke, Attach'd her with streight gripes, yet hee call'd those, Embracements of love; to loves worke he goes, Where deeds move more then words; nor doth she show, Nor much resist, nor needs hee streighten so His prey, for, were shee loose, she would nor brake, nor goe. XLIII Hee hath engag'd her; his, she wholy bides; Who not her owne, none others secrets hides, If to the flocke he come, and Abell there, She faines hoarse barkings, but she biteth not, Her faith is quite, but not her love forgot. At last a trap, of which some every where Abell had plac'd, ends all his losse, and feare, By the Wolves death; and now just time it was That a quicke soule should give life to that masse Of blood in Abels bitch, and thither this did passe. XLIV Some have their wives, their sisters some begot, But in the lives of Emperours you shall not Reade of a lust the which may equall this; This wolfe begot himselfe, and finished What he began alive, when hee was dead, Sonne to himselfe, and father too, hee is A ridling lust, for which Schoolemen would misse A proper name. The whelpe of both these lay In Abels tent, and with soft Moaba, His sister, being yong, it us'd to sport and play. XLV Hee soone for her too harsh, and churlish grew, And Abell (the dam dead) would use this new For the field, being of two kindes made, He, as his dam, from sheepe drove wolves away, And as his Sire, he made them his owne prey. Five yeares he liv'd, and cosened with his trade, Then hopelesse that his faults were hid, betraid Himselfe by flight, and by all followed, From dogges, a wolfe; from wolves, a dogge he fled; And, like a spie to both sides false, he perished. XLVI It quickned next a toyfull Ape, and so Gamesome it was, that it might freely goe From tent to tent, and with the children play, His organs now so like theirs hee doth finde, That why he cannot laugh, and speake his minde, He wonders. Much with all, most he doth stay With Adams fift daughter Siphatecia, Doth gaze on her, and, where she passeth, passe, Gathers her fruits, and tumbles on the grasse, And wisest of that kinde, the first true lover was. XLVII He was the first that more desir'd to have One then another; first that ere did crave Love by mute signes, and had no power to speake; First that could make love faces, or could doe The valters sombersalts, or us'd to wooe With hoiting gambolls, his owne bones to breake To make his mistresse merry; or to wreake Her anger on himselfe. Sinnes against kinde They easily doe, that can let feed their minde With outward beauty, beauty they in boyes and beasts do find. XLVIII By this misled, too low things men have prov'd, And too high; beasts and angels have beene lov'd; This Ape, though else through-vaine, in this was wise, He reach'd at things too high, but open way There was, and he knew not she would say nay; His toyes prevaile not, likelier meanes he tries, He gazeth on her face with teare-shot eyes, And up lifts subtly with his russet pawe Her kidskinne apron without feare or awe Of nature; nature hath no gaole, though shee hath law. XLIX First she was silly and knew not what he ment, That vertue, by his touches, chaft and spent, Succeeds an itchie warmth, that melts her quite, She knew not first, now cares not what he doth, And willing halfe and more, more then halfe Tooth She neither puls nor pushes, but outright Now cries, and now repents; when Tethelemite Her brother, entred, and a great stone threw After the Ape, who, thus prevented, flew, This house thus batter'd downe, the Soule possest a new. L And whether by this change she lose or win, She comes out next, where the Ape would have gone in, Adam and Eve had mingled bloods, and now Like Chimiques equall fires, her temperate wombe Had stew'd and form'd it: and part did become A spungie liver, that did richly allow, Like a free conduit, on a high hils brow, Life keeping moisture unto every part, Part hardned it selfe to a thicker heart, Whose busie furnaces lifes spirits do impart. LI Another part became the well of sense, The tender well arm'd feeling braine, from whence, Those sinowie strings which do our bodies tie, Are raveld out, and fast there by one end, Did this Soule limbes, these limbes a soule attend, And now they joyn'd: keeping some quality Of every past shape, she knew treachery, Rapine, deceit, and lust, and ills enow To be a woman. Themech she is now, Sister and wife to Caine, Caine that first did plow. LII Who ere thou beest that read'st this sullen Writ, Which just so much courts thee, as thou dost it, Let me arrest thy thoughts, wonder with mee, Why plowing, building, ruling and the rest, Or most of those arts, whence our lives are blest, By cursed Cains race invented be, And blest Seth vext us with Astronomie, Ther's nothing simply good, nor ill alone, Of every quality comparison, The onely measure is, and judge, opinion. HOLY SONNETS. 1. La Corona. Deigne at my hands this crown of prayer and praise, Weav'd in my low devout melancholie, Thou which of good, hast, yea art treasury, All changing unchang'd Antient of dayes, But doe not, with a vile crowne of fraile bayes, Reward my muses white sincerity, But what thy thorny crowne gain'd, that give mee, A crowne of Glory, which doth flower alwayes; The ends crowne our workes, but thou crown'st our ends, For, at our end begins our endlesse rest, The first last end, now zealously possest, With a strong sober thirst, my soule attends. 'Tis time that heart and voice be lifted high, Salvation to all that will is nigh, 2 Annvnciation. Salvation to all that will is nigh, That All, which alwayes is All every where, Which cannot sinne, and yet all sinnes must beare, Which cannot die, yet cannot chuse but die, Loe, faithfull Virgin, yeelds himselfe to lye In prison, in thy wombe; and though he there Can take no sinne, nor thou give, yet he'will weare Taken from thence, flesh, which deaths force may trie. Ere by the spheares time was created, thou Wast in his minde, who is thy Sonne, and Brother, Whom thou conceiv'st, conceiv'd; yea thou art now Thy Makers maker, and thy Fathers mother, Thou'hast light in darke; and shutst in little roome, Immensity cloysterd in thy deare wombe. 3 Nativitie. Immensitie cloysterd in thy deare wombe, Now leaves his welbelov'd imprisonment, There he hath made himselfe to his intent Weake enough, now into our world to come; But Oh, for thee, for him, hath th'Inne no roome? Yet lay him in this stall, and from the Orient, Starres, and wisemen will travell to prevent Th'effects of Herods jealous generall doome; Seest thou, my Soule, with thy faiths eyes, how he Which fils all place, yet none holds him, doth lye? Was not his pity towards thee wondrous high, That would have need to be pittied by thee? Kisse him, and with him into Egypt goe, With his kinde mother, who partakes thy woe. 4 Temple. With his kinde mother who partakes thy woe, Ioseph turne backe; see where your child doth sit, Blowing, yea blowing out those sparks of wit, Which himselfe on the Doctors did bestow; The Word but lately could not speake, and loe It sodenly speakes wonders, whence comes it, That all which was, and all which should be writ, A shallow seeming child, should deeply know? His Godhead was not soule to his manhood, Nor had time mellowed him to this ripenesse, But as for one which hath a long taske, 'Tis good, With the Sunne to beginne his businesse, He in his ages morning thus began By miracles exceeding power of man. 5 Crvcifying. By miracles exceeding power of man, Hee faith in some, envie in some begat, For, what weake spirits admire, ambitious, hate; In both affections many to him ran, But Oh! the worst are most, they will and can, Alas, and do, unto the immaculate, Whose creature Fate is, now prescribe a Fate, Measuring selfe-lifes infinity to span, Nay to an inch, loe, where condemned hee Beares his owne crosse, with paine, yet by and by When it beares him, he must beare more and die; Now thou art lifted up, draw mee to thee, And at thy death giving such liberall dole, Moyst, with one drop of thy blood, my dry soule. 6 Resvrrection. Moyst with one drop of thy blood, my dry soule, Shall (though she now be in extreme degree Too stony hard, and yet too fleshly,) bee Freed by that drop, from being starv'd, hard, or foule, And life, by this death abled, shall controule Death, whom thy death slue; nor shall to mee Feare of first or last death, bring miserie, If in thy little booke my name thou enroule, Flesh in that long sleep is not putrified, But made that there, of which, and for which 'twas; Nor can by other meanes be glorified. May then sinnes sleep, and death soone from me passe, That wak't from both, I againe risen may Salute the last, and everlasting day. 7 Ascention. Salute the last and everlasting day, Joy at the uprising of this Sunne, and Sonne, Yee whose just teares, or tribulation Have purely washt, or burnt your drossie clay; Behold the Highest, parting hence away, Lightens the darke clouds, which hee treads upon, Nor doth hee by ascending, show alone, But first hee, and hee first enters the way, O strong Ramme, which hast batter'd heaven for mee, Mild lambe which with thy blood, hast mark'd the path; Bright torch, which shin'st, that I the way may see, Oh, with thy owne blood quench thy owne just wrath, And if thy holy Spirit, my Muse did raise, Deigne at my hands this crowne of prayer and praise. I. [As due by many titles I resigne] As due by many titles I resigne My selfe to thee, O God, first I was made By thee, and for thee, and when I was decay'd Thy blood bought that, the which before was thine, I am thy sonne, made with thy selfe to shine, Thy servant, whose paines thou hast still repaid, Thy sheepe, thine Image, and till I betray'd My selfe, a temple of thy Spirit divine; Why doth the devill then usurpe on mee? Why doth he steale nay ravish that's thy right? Except thou rise and for thine owne worke fight, Oh I shall soone despaire, when I doe see That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt'not chuse me. And Satan hates mee, yet is loth to lose mee. II. [Oh my blacke Soule! now thou art summoned] Oh my blacke Soule! now thou art summoned By sicknesse, deaths herald, and champion; Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done Treason, and durst not turne to whence hee is fled, Or like a thiefe, which till deaths doome be read, Wisheth himselfe delivered from prison; But damn'd and hal'd to execution, Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned; Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lacke; But who shall give thee that grace to beginne? Oh make thy selfe with holy mourning blacke, And red with blushing, as thou art with sinne; Or wash thee in Christs blood, which hath this might That being red, it dyes red soules to white. III. [This is my playes last scene, here heavens appoint] This is my playes last scene, here heavens appoint My pilgrimages last mile; and my race Idly, yet quickly runne, hath this last pace, My spans last inch, my minutes latest point, And gluttonous death, will instantly unjoynt My body, and my soule, and I shall sleepe a space, But my'ever-waking part shall see that face, Whose feare already shakes my every joynt: Then, as my soule, to'heaven her first seate, takes flight, And earth borne body, in the earth shall dwell, So, fall my sinnes, that all may have their right, To where they'are bred, and would presse me, to hell. Impute me righteous, thus purg'd of evill, For thus I leave the world, the flesh the devill. IV. [At the round earths imagin'd corners, blow] At the round earths imagin'd corners, blow Your trumpets, Angells, and arise, arise From death, you numberlesse infinities Of soules, and to your scattred bodies goe, All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow, All whom warre, death, age, agues, tyrannies, Despaire, law, chance, hath slaine, and you whose eyes, Shall behold God, and never tast deaths woe, But let them sleepe, Lord, and mee mourne a space, For, if above all these, my sinnes abound, 'Tis late to aske abundance of thy grace, When wee are there; here on this lowly ground, Teach mee how to repent; for that's as good As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon, with thy blood. V. [If poysonous mineralls, and if that tree] If poysonous mineralls, and if that tree, Whose fruit threw death on else immortall us, If lecherous goats, if serpents envious Cannot be damn'd; Alas; why should I bee? Why should intent or reason, borne in mee, Make sinnes, else equall, in mee, more heinous? And mercy being easie, and glorious To God, in his sterne wrath, why threatens hee? But who am I, that dare dispute with thee? O God, Oh! of thine onely worthy blood, And my teares, make a heavenly Lethean flood, And drowne in it my sinnes blacke memorie, That thou remember them, some claime as debt, I thinke it mercy, if thou wilt forget, VI. [Death be not proud, though some have called thee] Death be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe, For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow, Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee; From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee, Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow, And soonest our best men with thee doe goe, Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie Thou art slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, And doth with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell. And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well, And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then? One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally, And death shall be no more, death thou shalt die. VII. [Spit in my face you Jewes, and pierce my side] Spit in my face you Jewes, and pierce my side, Buffet, and scoffe, scourge, and crucifie mee, For I have sinn'd, and sinn'd, and onely hee, Who could do no iniquitie, hath dyed: But by my death can not be satisfied My sinnes, which passe the Jewes impiety: They kill'd once an inglorious man, but I Crucifie him daily, being now glorified; Oh let mee then, his strange love still admire: Kings pardon but he bore our punishment. And Iacob came cloth'd in vile harsh attire But to supplant, and with gainfull intent God cloth'd himselfe in vile mans flesh, that so Hee might be weake enough to suffer woe. VIII. [Why are wee by all creatures waited on?] Why are wee by all creatures waited on? Why doe the prodigall elements supply Life and food to mee, being more pure then I, Simple, and further from corruption? Why brook'st thou, ignorant horse, subjection? Why dost thou bull, and bore so seelily Dissemble weaknesse, and by'one mans stroke die, Whose whole kinde, you might swallow &amp; feed upon? Weaker I am, woe is mee, and worse then you, You have not sinn'd, nor need be timorous, But wonder at a greater wonder, for to us Created nature doth these things subdue, But their Creator, whom sin, nor nature tyed, For us, his Creatures, and his foes, hath dyed. IX. [What if this present were the worlds last night?] What if this present were the worlds last night? Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell, The picture of Christ crucified, and tell Whether his countenance can thee affright, Teares in his eyes quench the amasing light, Blood fills his frownes, which from his pierc'd head fell And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell, Which pray'd forgivenesse for his foes fierce spight? No, no; but as in my idolatrie I said to all my profane mistresses, Beauty, of pitty, foulnesse onely is A signe of rigour: so I say to thee, To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd, This beauteous forme assumes a pitious minde. X. [Batter my heart, three person'd God; for, you] Batter my heart, three person'd God; for, you As yet but knocke, breathe, shine, and seeke to mend; That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow mee, 'and bend Your force, to breake, blowe, burn and make me new. I, like an usurpt towne, to'another due, Labour to'admit you, but Oh, to no end, Reason your viceroy in mee, mee should defend, But is captiv'd, and proves weake or untrue, Yet dearely'I love you', and would be lov'd faine, But am betroth'd unto your enemie, Divorce mee, 'untie, or breake that knot againe, Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I Except you'enthrall mee, never shall be free, Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee. XI. [Wilt thou love God, as he thee! then digest] Wilt thou love God, as he thee! then digest, My Soule, this wholsome meditation, How God the Spirit, by Angels waited on In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy brest, The Father having begot a Sonne most blest, And still begetting, (for he ne'r begonne) Hath deign'd to chuse thee by adoption, Coheire to'his glory, 'and Sabbaths endlesse rest; And as a robb'd man, which by search doth finde His stolne stuffe sold, must lose or buy'it againe: The Sonne of glory came downe, and was slaine, Us whom he'had made, and Satan stolne, to unbinde. 'Twas much, that man was made like God before, But, that God should be made like man, much more. XII. [Father, part of his double interest] Father, part of his double interest Unto thy kingdome, thy Sonne gives to mee, His joynture in the knottie Trinitie, Hee keepes, and gives to me his deaths conquest. This Lambe, whose death, with life the world hath blest, Was from the worlds beginning slaine, and he Hath made two Wills, which with the Legacie Of his and thy kingdome, doe thy Sonnes invest, Yet such are these laws, that men argue yet Whether a man those statutes can fulfill; None doth, but thy all-healing grace and Spirit, Revive againe what law and letter kill, Thy lawes abridgement, and thy last command Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand! EPIGRAMS. Hero and Leander. Both rob'd of aire, we both lye in one ground, Both whom one fire had burnt, one water drownd. Pyramus and Thisbe. Two, by themselves, each other, love and feare Slaine, cruell friends, by parting have joyn'd here. Niobe. By childrens births, and death, I am become So dry, that I am now mine owne sad tombe. A burnt ship. Out of a fired ship, which, by no way But drowning, could be rescued from the flame, Some men leap'd forth, and ever as they came Neere the foes ships, did by their shot decay; So all were lost, which in the ship were found, They in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drown'd. Fall of a wall. Under an undermin'd, and shot-bruis'd wall A too-bold Captaine perish'd by the fall, Whose brave misfortune, happiest men envi'd, That had a towne for tombe, his bones to hide. A lame begger. I am unable, yonder begger cries, To stand, or moue; if he say true, hee lies. A selfe accuser. Your mistris, that you follow whores, still taxeth you: 'Tis strange that she should thus confesse it, though'it be true. A licentious person. Thy sinnes and haires may no man equall call, For, as thy sinnes increase, thy haires doe fall. Antiquary. If in his Studie he hath so much care To'hang all old strange things, let his wife beware. Disinherited. Thy father all from thee, by his last Will Gave to the poore; Thou hast good title still. Phryne. Thy flattering picture, Phryne, is like thee, Onely in this, that you both painted be. An obscure writer. Philo, with twelve yeares study, hath beene griev'd, To'be understood, when will hee be beleev'd. Klockius so deeply hath sworne, ne'r more to come In bawdie house, that hee dares not goe home. Raderus. Why this man gelded Martiall I muse, Except himselfe alone his tricks would use, As Katherine, for the Courts sake, put downe Stewes. Mercurius Gallo-Belgicus. Like Esops fellow-slaves, O Mercury, Which could do all things, thy faith is; and I Like Esops selfe, which nothing; I confesse I should have had more faith, if thou hadst lesse; Thy credit lost thy credit: 'Tis sinne to doe, In this case, as thou wouldst be done unto, To beleeve all: Change thy name: thou art like Mercury in stealing, but lyest like a Greeke. Compassion in the world againe is bred: Ralphius is sick, the broker keeps his bed. [Elegies.] ELEGIE. I. [Fond woman which would'st have thy husband die] Fond woman which would'st have thy husband die, And yet complain'st of his great jealousie; If swolne with poyson, hee lay in'his last bed, His body with a sere-barke covered, Drawing his breath, as thick and short, as can The nimblest crocheting Musitian, Ready with loathsome vomiting to spue His Soule out of one hell, into a new, Made deafe with his poore kindreds howling cries, Begging with few feign'd teares, great legacies, Thou would'st not weepe, but jolly, 'and frolicke bee, As a slave, which to morrow should be free, Yet weep'st thou, when thou seest him hungerly Swallow his owne death, hearts-bane jealousie. O give him many thanks, he'is courteous, That in suspecting kindly warneth us. Wee must not, as wee us'd, flout openly, In scoffing ridles, his deformitie; Nor at his boord together being satt, With words, nor touch, scarce lookes adulterate. Nor when he swolne, and pamper'd with great fare Sits downe, and snorts, cag'd in his basket chaire, Must wee usurpe his owne bed any more, Nor kisse and play in his house, as before. Now I see many dangers; for it is His realme, his castle, and his diocesse. But if, as envious men, which would revile Their Prince, or coyne his gold, themselves exile Into another countrie, 'and doe it there, Wee play'in another house, what should we feare? There we will scorne his houshold policies, His seely plots, and pensionary spies, As the inhabitants of Thames right side Do Londons Major, or Germans, the Popes pride. Elegie II. [Marry, and love thy Flavia, for, shee] Marry, and love thy Flavia, for, shee Hath all things, whereby others beautious bee, For, though her eyes be small, her mouth is great, Though they be Ivory, yet her teeth be jeat, Though they be dimme, yet she is light enough, And though her harsh haire fall, her skinne is rough; What though her cheeks be yellow, her haire's red, Give her thine, and she hath a maydenhead. These things are beauties elements, where these Meet in one, that one must, as perfect, please. If red and white and each good quality Be in thy wench, ne'r aske where it doth lye. In buying things perfum'd, we aske; if there Be muske and amber in it, but not where. Though all her parts be not in th'usuall place, She'hath yet an Anagram of a good face. If we might put the letters but one way, In the leane dearth of words, what could wee say? When by the Gamut some Musitions make A perfect song, others will undertake, By the same Gamut chang'd, to equall it. Things simply good, can never be unfit; She's faire as any, if all be like her, And if none bee, then she is singular. All love is wonder; if wee justly doe Account her wonderfull, why not lovely too? Love built on beauty, soone as beauty, dies, Chuse this face, chang'd by no deformities; Women are all like Angels; the faire be Like those which fell to worse; but such as shee, Like to good Angels, nothing can impaire: 'Tis lesse griefe to be foule, then to'have beene faire. For one nights revels, silke and gold we chuse, But, in long journeyes, cloth, and leather use. Beauty is barren oft; best husbands say There is best land, where there is foulest way. Oh what a soveraigne Plaister will shee bee If thy past sinnes have taught thee jealousie! Here needs no spies, nor eunuches; her commit Safe to thy foes; yea, to a Marmosit. When Belgiaes citties, the round countries drowne, That durty foulenesse guards, and armes the towne: So doth her face guard her; and so, for thee, Which, forc'd by businesse, absent oft must bee, Shee, whose face, like clouds, turnes the day to night, Who, mightier th? the sea, makes Moores seem white, Who, though seaven yeares, she in the Stews had laid, A Nunnery durst receive, and thinke a maid, And though in childbeds labour she did lie, Midwifes would sweare, 'twere but a tympanie, Whom, if shee accuse her selfe, I credit lesse Then witches, which impossibles confesse. One like none, and lik'd of none, fittest were, For, things in fashion every man will weare. Elegie III. [Although thy hand and faith, and good workes too] Although thy hand and faith, and good workes too, Have seal'd thy love which nothing should undoe, Yea though thou fall backe, that apostasie Confirme thy love; yet much, much I feare thee. Women, are like the Arts, forc'd unto none, Open to'all searchers, unpriz'd, if unknowne. If I have caught a bird, and let him flie, Another fouler using these meanes, as I, May catch the same bird; and, as these things bee, Women are made for men, not him, nor mee. Foxes and goats; all beasts change when they please, Shall women, more hot, wily, wild then these, Be bound to one man, and did Nature then Idly make them apter to'endure then men? They'are our clogges, not their owne; if a man bee Chain'd to a galley, yet the galley'is free; Who hath a plow-land, casts all his seed corne there, And yet allowes his ground more corne should beare; Though Danuby into the sea must flow, The sea receives the Rhene, Volga, and Po. By nature, which gave it, this liberty Thou lov'st, but Oh! canst thou love it and mee? Likenesse glues love: and if that thou so doe, To make us like and love, must I change too? More then thy hate, I hate'it, rather let mee Allow her change, then change as oft as shee, And soe not teach, but force my'opinion To love not any one, nor every one. To live in one land, is captivitie, To runne all countries, a wild roguery; Waters stincke soone, if in one place they bide, And in the vast sea are more putrifi'd: But when they kisse one banke, and leaving this Never looke backe, but the next banke doe kisse, Then are they purest; Change'is the nursery Of musicke, joy, life, and eternity. Elegie IV. [Once, and but once found in thy company] Once, and but once found in thy company, All thy suppos'd escapes are laid on mee; And as a thiefe at barre, is question'd there By all the men, that have beene rob'd that yeare, So am I, (by this traiterous meanes surpriz'd) By thy Hydroptique father catechiz'd. Though hee hath oft sworne, that hee would remove Thy beauties beautie, and food of our love, Hope of his goods, if I with thee were seene, Yet close and secret, as our soules, we'have beene. Though thy immortall mother which doth lye Still buried in her bed, yet will not dye, Takes this advantage to sleepe out day-light, And watch thy entries, and returnes all night, And, when she takes thy hand, and would seeme kind, Doth search what rings, and armelets she can finde, And kissing notes the colour of thy face, And fearing least thou'art swolne, doth thee embrace; To trie if thou long, doth name strange meates. And notes thy palenesse, blushing, sighs, and sweats; And politiquely will to thee confesse The sinnes of her owne youths ranke lustinesse; Yet love these Sorceries did remove, and move Thee to gull thine owne mother for my love. Thy little brethren, which like Faiery Sprights Oft skipt into our chamber, those sweet nights, And kist, and ingled on thy fathers knee, Were brib'd next day, to tell what they did see. The grim-eight-foot-high-iron-bound serving-man, That oft names God in oathes, and onely than, He that to barre the first gate, doth as wide As the great Rhodian Colossus stride, Which, if in hell no other paines there were, Makes mee feare hell, because he must be there: Though by thy father he were hir'd to this, Could never witnesse any touch or kisse; But Oh, too common ill, I brought with mee That, which betray'd mee to my enemie: A loud perfume, which at my entrance cryed Even at thy fathers nose, so were wee spied. When, like a tyran King, that in his bed Smelt gunpowder, the pale wretch shivered; Had it beene some bad smell, he would have thought That his owne feet, or breath, that smell had wrought. But as wee in our Ile emprisoned, Where cattell onely, 'and diverse dogs are bred, The pretious Vnicornes, strange monsters, call, So thought he good, strange, that had none at all. I taught my silkes, their whistling to forbeare, Even my opprest shoes, dumbe and speechlesse were, Onely, thou bitter sweet, whom I had laid Next mee, mee traiterously hast betraid, And unsuspected hast invisibly At once fled unto him, and staid with mee. Base excrement of earth, which dost confound Sense, from distinguishing the sicke from sound; By thee the seely Amorous sucks his death By drawing in a leprous harlots breath, By thee, the greatest staine to mans estate Falls on us, to be call'd effeminate; Though you be much lov'd in the Princes hall, There, things that seeme, exceed substantiall. Gods, when yee fum'd on altars, were pleas'd well, Because you'were burnt, not that they lik'd your smell, You'are loathsome all, being taken simply alone, Shall wee love ill things joyn'd, and hate each one? If you were good, your good doth soone decay; And you are rare, that takes the good away. All my perfumes, I give most willingly To'embalme thy fathers corse; What? will hee die? Elegie V. [Here take my Picture, though I bid farewell] Here take my Picture, though I bid farewell; Thine, in my heart, where my soule dwels, shall dwell. 'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more When wee are shadowes both, then 'twas before. When weather-beaten I come backe; my hand, Perhaps with rude oares torne, or Sun beams tann'd, My face and brest of hairecloth, and my head With cares rash sodaine stormes, being o'rspread, My body'a sack of bones, broken within, And powders blew staines scatter'd on my skinne; If rivall fooles taxe thee to'have lov'd a man, So foule, and course, as, Oh, I may seeme than, This shall say what I was: and thou shalt say, Doe his hurts reach mee? doth my worth decay? Or doe they reach his judging minde, that hee Should now love lesse, what hee did love to see? That which in him was faire and delicate, Was but the milke, which in loves childish state Did nurse it: who now is growne strong enough To feed on that, which to disus'd tasts seemes tough. Elegie VI. [On the L. C.] Sorrow, who to this house scarce knew the way: Is, Oh, heire of it, our All is his prey. This strange chance claimes strange wonder, and to us Nothing can be so strange, as to weepe thus; 'Tis well his lifes loud speaking workes deserve, And give praise too, our cold tongues could not serve: 'Tis well, hee kept teares from our eyes before, That to fit this deep ill, we might have store. Oh, if a sweet briar, climbe up by'a tree, If to a paradise that transplanted bee, Or fell'd, and burnt for holy sacrifice, Yet, that must wither, which by it did rise, As wee for him dead: though no familie Ere rigg'd a soule for heavens discoverie With whom more Venturers more boldly dare Venture their states, with him in joy to share Wee lose what all friends lov'd, him, he gaines now But life by death, which worst foes would allow, If hee could have foes, in whose practise grew All vertues, whose names subtile Schoolmen knew; What ease, can hope that wee shall see'him, beget, When wee must die first, and cannot dye yet? His children are his pictures, Oh they bee Pictures of him dead, senselesse, cold as he, Here needs no marble Tombe, since hee is gone, He, and about him, his, are turn'd to stone. Elegie VII. [Oh, let mee not serve so, as those men serve] Oh, let mee not serve so, as those men serve Whom honours smoakes at once fatten and sterve; Poorely enrich't with great mens words or lookes; Nor so write my name in thy loving bookes As those Idolatrous flatterers, which still Their Princes stiles, which many Realmes fulfill Whence they no tribute have, and where no sway. Such services I offer as shall pay Themselves, I hate dead names: Oh then let mee Favorite in Ordinary, or no favorite bee. When my Soule was in her owne body sheath'd, Nor yet by oathes betroth'd, nor kisses breath'd Into my Purgatory, faithlesse thee, Thy heart seem'd waxe, and steele thy constancie. So, carelesse flowers strow'd on the waters face, The curled whirlepooles suck, smack, and embrace, Yet drowne them; so, the tapers beamie eye Amorously twinkling, beckens the giddie flie, Yet burnes his wings; and such the devill is, Scarce visiting them, who are intirely his. When I behold a streame, which, from the spring, Doth with doubtfull melodious murmuring, Or in a speechlesse slumber, calmely ride Her wedded channels bosome, and then chide And bend her browes, and swell if any bough Do but stoop downe, or kisse her upmost brow: Yet, if her often gnawing kisses winne The traiterous banks to gape, and let her in, She rusheth violently, and doth divorce Her from her native, and her long-kept course, And rores, and braves it, and in gallant scorne, In flattering eddies promising retorne, She flouts the channell, who thenceforth is drie; Then say I; that is shee, and this am I. Yet let not thy deepe bitternesse beget Carelesse despaire in mee, for that will whet My minde to scorne; and Oh, love dull'd with paine Was ne'r so wise, nor well arm'd as disdaine. Then with new eyes I shall survay thee,'and spie Death in thy cheekes, and darknesse in thine eye; Though hope bred faith and love; thus taught, I shall As nations do from Rome, from thy love fall. My hate shall outgrow thine, and utterly I will renounce thy dalliance: and when I Am the Recusant, in that resolute state, What hurts it mee to be'excommunicate? Elegie VIII. [Natures lay Ideot, I taught thee to love] Natures lay Ideot, I taught thee to love, And in that sophistrie, Oh, thou dost prove Too subtile: Foole, thou didst not understand The mystique language of the eye nor hand: Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the aire Of sighes, and say, this lies, this sounds despaire. Nor by the'eyes water call a maladie Desperately hot, or changing feaverously. I had not taught thee then, the Alphabet Of flowers, how they devisefully being set And bound up, might with speechlesse secrecie Deliver arrands mutely, and mutually. Remember since all thy words us'd to bee To every suitor; I, if my friends agree. Since, houshold charmes, thy husbands name to teach, Were all the love trickes, that thy wit could reach; And since, an houres discourse could scarce have made One answer in thee, and that ill arraid In broken proverbs, and torne sentences. Thou art not by so many duties his, That from the worlds Common having sever'd thee, Inlaid thee, neither to be seene, nor see, As mine: who have with amorous delicacies Refin'd thee'into a blis-full paradise. Thy graces and good words my creatures bee, I planted knowledge and lifes tree in thee, Which Oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas Frame and enamell Plate, and drinke in glasse? Chafe waxe for others seales? breake a colts force And leave him then, beeing made a ready horse? THE STORME. To M? Christopher Brooke. Thou which art I, ('tis nothing to be soe) Thou which art still thy selfe, by these shalt know Part of our passage; And, a hand, or eye By Hilliard drawne, is worth an history, By a worse painter made; and (without pride) When by thy judgment they are dignifi'd, My lines are such. 'Tis the preheminence Of friendship onely to'impute excellence. England to whom we'owe, what we be, and have, Sad that her sonnes did seeke a forraine grave (For, Fates, or Fortunes drifts none can Southsay, Honour and misery have one face and way.) From out her pregnant intrailes sigh'd a winde Which at th'ayres middle marble roo me did finde Such strong resistance, that it selfe it threw Downeward againe; and so when it did view How in the port, our fleet deare time did leese, Withering like prisoners, which lye but for fees, Mildly it kist our sailes, and, fresh, and sweet, As, to a stomack sterv'd, whose insides meete, Meate comes, it came; and swole our sailes, when wee So joyd, as Sara'her swelling joy'd to see. But 'twas, but so kinde, as our countrimen, Which bring friends one dayes way, and leave them then. Then like two mighty Kings, which dwelling farre Asunder, meet against a third to warre, The South and West winds joyn'd, and, as they blew, Waves like a rowling trench before them threw. Sooner then you read this line, did the gale, Like shot, not fear'd, till felt, our sailes assaile; And what at first was call'd a gust, the same Hath now a stormes, anon a tempests name. Ionas, I pitty thee, and curse those men, Who when the storm rag'd most, did wake thee then; Sleepe is paines easiest salue, and doth fullfill All offices of death, except to kill. But when I wakt, I saw, that I saw not. I, and the Sunne, which should teach mee'had forgot East, West, day, night, and I could onely say, If'the world had lasted, now it had beene day. Thousands our noyses were, yet wee'mongst all Could none by his right name, but thunder call: Lightning was all our light, and it rain'd more Then if the Sunne had drunke the sea before; Some coffin'd in their cabbins lye, 'equally Griev'd that they are not dead, and yet must dye. And as sin-burd'ned soules from grave will creepe, At the last day, some forth their cabbins peepe: And tremblingly'aske what newes, and doe heare so, Like jealous husbands, what they would not know. Some sitting on the hatches, would seeme there, With hideous gazing to feare away feare. Then note they the ships sicknesses, the Mast Shak'd with this ague, and the Hold and Wast With a salt dropsie clog'd, and all our tacklings Snapping, like too-high-stretched treble strings. And from our totterd sailes, ragges drop downe so, As from one hang'd in chaines, a yeare agoe. Even our Ordinance plac'd for our defence, Strive to breake loose, and scape away from thence. Pumping hath tir'd our men, and what's the gaine? Seas into seas throwne, we suck in againe; Hearing hath deaf'd our saylers; and if they Knew how to heare, there's none knowes what to say. Compar'd to these stormes, death is but a qualme, Hell somewhat lightsome, and the' Bermuda calme. Darknesse, lights eldest brother, his birth-right Claim'd o'r this world, and to heaven hath chas'd light. All things are one, and that one none can be, Since all formes, uniforme deformity Doth cover, so that wee, except God say Another Fiat, shall have no more day. So violent, yet long these furies bee, That though thine absence sterve me, 'I wish not thee. THE CALME. Our storme is past, and that storms tyrannous rage, A stupid calme, but nothing it, doth swage. The fable is inverted, and farre more A blocke afflicts, now, then a storke before. Stormes chafe, and soone weare out themselves, or us; In calmes, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus. As steady'as I can wish, that my thoughts were, Smooth as thy mistresse glasse, or what shines there, The sea is now. And, as the Iles which wee Seeke, when wee can move, our ships rooted bee. As water did in stormes, now pitch runs out As lead, when a fir'd Church becomes one spout. And all our beauty, and our trimme, decayes, Like courts removing, or like ended playes. The fighting place now seamens ragges supply; And all the tackling is a frippery. No use of lanthornes; and in one place lay Feathers and dust, to day and yesterday. Earths hollownesses, which the worlds lungs are, Have no more winde then the upper valt of aire. We can nor lost friends, nor sought foes recover, But meteorlike, save that wee move not, hover. Onely the Calenture together drawes Deare friends, which meet dead in great fishes jawes: And on the hatches as on Altars lyes Each one, his owne Priest, and owne Sacrifice. Who live, that miracle do multiply Where walkers in hot Ovens, doe not dye. If in despite of these, wee swimme, that hath No more refreshing, then our brimstone Bath, But from the sea, into the ship we turne, Like parboyl'd wretches, on the coales to burne. Like Bajazet encag'd, the sheepheards scoffe, Or like slacke sinew'd Sampson, his haire off, Languish our ships. Now, as a Miriade Of Ants, durst th'Emperours lov'd snake invade, The crawlin Gallies, Sea-goales, finny chips, Might brave our venices, now bed-ridde ships. Whether a rotten state, and hope of gaine, Or, to difuse mee from the queasie paine Of being belov'd, and loving, or the thirst Of honour, or faire death, out pusht mee first, Hose my end: for here as well as I A desperate may live, and a coward die. Stagge, dogge, and all which from, or towards flies, Is paid with life, or pray, or doing dyes. Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay A scourge, 'gainst which wee all forget to pray, He that at sea prayes for more winde, as well Under the poles may begge cold, heat in hell. What are wee then? How little more alas Is man now, then before he was? he was Nothing; for us, wee are for nothing fit; Chance, or our selves still disproportion it. Wee have no power, no will, no sense; I lye, I should not then thus feele this miserie. To S? Henry Wotton. Sir, more then kisses, letters mingle Soules; For, thus friends absent speake. This ease controules The tediousnesse of my life: But for these I could ideate nothing, which could please, But I should wither in one day, and passe To'a botle'of Hay, that am a locke of Grasse. Life is a voyage, and in our lifes wayes Countries, Courts, Towns are Rockes, or Remoraes; They breake or stop all ships, yet our state's such, That though then pitch they staine worse, wee must touch. If in the furnace of the raging line, Or under th'adverse icy pole thou pine, Thou know'st two temperate Regions girded in, Dwell there: But Oh, what refuge canst thou winne Parch'd in the Court, and in the country frozen? Shall cities built of both extremes be chosen? Can dung, and garlike be'a perfume? or can A Scorpion, or Torpedo cure a man? Cities are worst of all three; of all three (O knottie riddle) each is worst equally. Cities are Sepulchers; they who dwell there Are carcases, as if no such they were. And Courts are Theaters, where some men play Princes, some slaves, all to one end, and of one clay. The Country is a desert, where no good, Gain'd, as habits, not borne, is understood. There men become beasts, and prone to more evils; In cities blockes, and in a lewd court, devills. As in the first Chaos confusedly Each elements qualities were in the'other three; So pride, lust, covetize, being severall To these three places, yet all are in all, And mingled thus, their issue incestuous. Falshood is denizon'd. Virtue is barbarous. Let no man say there, Virtues flintie wall Shall locke vice in mee, I'll do none, but know all. Men are spunges, which to poure out, receive, Who know false play, rather then lose, deceive. For in best understandings, sinne beganne, Angels sinn'd first, then Devills, and then man. Onely perchance beasts sinne not; wretched wee Are beasts in all, but white integritie. I thinke if men, which in these places live Durst looke in themselves, and themselves retrive, They would like strangers greet themselves, seeing then Utopian youth, growne old Italian. Be thou thine owne home, and in thy selfe dwell; Inne any where, continuance maketh hell. And seeing the snaile, which every where doth rome, Carrying his owne house still, still is at home. Follow (for he is easie pac'd) this snaile, Bee thine owne Palace, or the world's thy goale; And in the worlds sea, do not like corke sleepe Upon the waters face; nor in the deepe Sinke like a lead without a line: but as Fishes glide, leaving no print where they passe, Nor making sound; so, closely thy course goe, Let men dispute, whether thou breath, or no: Onely'in this one thing, be no Galenist. To make Courts hot ambitions wholesome, do not take A dramme of Countries dulnesse; do not adde Correctives, but as chymiques, purge the bad. But, Sir, I advise not you, I rather doe Say o'er those lessons, which I learn'd of you. Whom, free from German schismes, and lightnesse Of France, and faire Italies faithlesnesse, Having from these suck'd all they had of worth, And brought home that faith, which you carried forth, I throughly love. But if my selfe, I'have wonne To know my rules, I have, and you have Donne: The Crosse. Since Christ embrac'd the Crosse it selfe, dare I His image, th'image of his Crosse deny? Would I have profit by the sacrifice, And dare the chosen Altar to despise? It bore all other sinnes, but is it fit That it should beare the sinne of scorning it? Who from the picture would avert his eye, How would he flye his paines, who there did dye? From mee, no Pulpit, nor misgrounded law, Nor scandall taken, shall this Crosse withdraw, It shall not, for it cannot; for, the losse Of this Crosse, were to mee another Crosse. Better were worse, for, no affliction No Crosse is so extreme, as to have none; Who can blot out the Crosse, which th'instrument Of God, dew'd on mee in the Sacrament? Who can deny mee power, and liberty To stretch mine armes, and mine owne Crosse to be? Swimme, and at every stroake, thou art thy Crosse, The Mast and yard make one, where seas do tosse. Looke downe, thou spiest out Crosses in small things; Looke up, thou seest birds rais'd on crossed wings; All the Globes frame, and spheares, is nothing else But the Meridians crossing Parallels. Materiall Crosses then, good physicke bee, But yet spirituall have chiefe dignity. These for extracted chimique medicine serve, And cure much better, and as well preserve; Then are you your own physicke, or need none, When Still'd, or purg'd by tribulation. For when that Crosse ungrudg'd, unto you stickes, Then are you to your selfe, a Crucifixe. As perchance, Carvers do not faces make: But that away, which hid them there, do take. Let Crosses, soe, take what hid Christ in thee, And be his image, or not his, but hee. But, as oft, Alchimists doe coyners prove, So may a selfe-dispising, get selfe-love. And then as worst surfets, of best meates bee, Soe is pride, issued from humility, For, 'tis no child, but monster; therefore Crosse Your joy in crosses, else, 'tis double losse, And crosse thy senses, else, both they, and thou Must perish soone, and to destruction bowe. For if the'eye seeke good objects, and will take No crosse from bad, wee cannot scape a snake. So with harsh, hard, sowre, stinking, crosse the rest, Make them indifferent; call nothing best. But most the eye needs crossing, that can rome, And move; To th'other th'objects must come home. And crosse thy heart: for that in man alone Pants downewards, and hath palpitation. Crosse those dejections, when it downeward tends, And when it to forbidden heights pretends. And as the braine through bony walls doth vent By futures, which a Crosses forme present, So when thy braine workes, ere thou utter it, Crosse and correct concupiscence of witt. Be covetous of Crosses, let none fall. Crosse no man else, but crosse thy selfe in all. Then doth the Crosse of Christ worke faithfully Within our hearts, when wee love harmlesly The Crosses pictures much, and with more care That Crosses children, which our Crosses are. Elegie on the Lady Marckham. Man is the World, and death th'Ocean, To which God gives the lower parts of man. This Sea invirons all, and though as yet God hath set markes, and bounds, twixt us and it, Yet doth it rore, and gnaw, and still pretend, And breaks our banke, when ere it takes a friend. Then our land waters (teares of passion) vent; Our waters, then, above our firmament. (Teares which our Soule doth for her sins let fall) Take all a brackish tast, and Funerall. And even those teares, which should wash sin, are sin. We, after Gods Noe, drowne the world againe. Nothing but man of all invenom'd things Doth worke upon itselfe, with inborne stings. Teares are false Spectacles, we cannot see Through passions mist, what wee are, or what shee. In her this sea of death hath made no breach, But as the tide doth wash the slimie beach, And leaves embroderd workes upon the sand, So is her flesh refin'd by deaths cold hand. As men of China, 'after an ages stay Do take up Porcelane, where they buried Clay; So at this grave, her limbecke, which refines The Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, Pearles, &amp; Mines, Of which, this flesh was, her soule shall inspire Flesh of such stuffe, as God, when his last fire Annuls this world, to recompence it, shall, Make and name then, th'Elixar of this All. They say, the sea, when it galnes, loseth too; If carnall Death (the yonger brother) doe Usurpe the body, 'our soule, which subject is To th'elder death, by sinne, is freed by this; They perish both, when they attempt the just; For, graves our trophies are, and both, deaths dust. So, unobnoxious now, she'hath buried both; For, none to death sinnes, that to sinne is loth. Nor doe they die, which are not loth to die, So hath she this, and that virginity. Grace was in her extremely diligent, That kept her from sinne, yet made her repent. Of what small spots pure white complaines! Alas, How little poyson cracks a christall glasse? She sinn'd, but just enough to let us see That, extreme truth lack'd little of a lye, Making omissions, acts; laying the touch Of sinne, on things that sometimes may be such. As Moses Cherubines, whose natures doe Surpasse all speed, by him are winged too: So would her soule, already'in heaven, seeme then, To clyme by teares, the common staires of men. How fit she was for God, I am content To speake, that death his vaine hast may repent. How fit for us, how even and how sweet, How good in all her titles, and how meet, To have reform'd this forward heresie, That woman can no parts of friendship bee; How Morall, how Divine shall not be told, Lest they that heare her vertues, thinke her old. And lest we take Deaths part, and make him glad Of such a prey, and to his tryumph adde. Elegie on M??? Boulstred. Death I recant, and say, unsaid by mee What ere hath slip'd, that might diminish thee. Spirituall treason, atheisme 'tis, to say, That any can thy Summons disobey. Th'earths face is but thy Table; there are set Plants, cattell, men, dishes for Death to eate. In a rude hunger now hee millions drawes Into his bloody, or plaguy, or sterv'd jawes. Now hee will seeme to spare, and doth more wast, Eating the best first, well preserv'd to last. Now wantonly he spoiles, and eates us not, But breakes off friends, and lets us peecemeale rot. Nor will this earth serve him; he sinkes the deepe Where harmelesse fish monastique silence keepe. Who (were Death dead) by Roes of living sand, Might spunge that element, and make it land. He rounds the aire, and breakes the hymnique notes In birds, Heavens choristers, organique throats, Which (if they did not dye) might seeme to bee A tenth ranke in the heavenly hierarchie. O strong and long-liv'd death, how cam'st thou in? And how without Creation didst begin? Thou hast, and shalt see dead, before thou dyest, All the foure Monarchies, and Antichrist. How could I thinke thee nothing, that see now In all this All, nothing else is, but thou. Our births and life, vices, and vertues, bee Wastfull consumptions, and degrees of thee. For, wee to live, our bellowes weare, and breath, Nor are wee mortall, dying, dead, but death. And though thou beest, O mighty bird of prey, So much reclaim'd by God, that thou must lay All that thou kill'st at his feet, yet doth hee Reserve but few, and leaves the most to thee. And of those few, now thou hast overthrowne One whom thy blow, makes, not ours, nor thine own. She was more stories high: hopelesse to come To her Soule, thou'hast offer'd at her lower roome. Her Soule and body was a King and Court: But thou hast both of Captaine mist and fort. As houses fall not, though the King remove, Bodies of Saints rest for their soules above. Death gets 'twixt soules and bodies such a place As sinne insinuates 'twixt just men and grace, Both worke a separation, no divorce. Her Soule is gone to usher up her corse, Which shall be'almost another soule, for there Bodies are purer, then best Soules are here. Because in her, her virtues did outgoe Her yeares, would'st thou, O emulous death, do so? And kill her young to thy losse? must the cost Of beauty, 'and wit, apt to doe harme, be lost? What though thou found'st her proofe 'gainst sins of youth? Oh, every age a diverse sinne pursueth. Thou should'st have stay'd, and taken better hold, Shortly ambitious, covetous, when old, She might have prov'd: and such devotion Might once have stray'd to superstition. If all her vertues must have growne, yet might Abundant virtue'have bred a proud delight. Had she persever'd just, there would have bin Some that would sinne, mis-thinking she did sinne. Such as would call her friendship, love, and faine To sociablenesse, a name profane. Or sinne, by tempting, or, not daring that, By wishing, though they never told her what. Thus might'st thou' have slain more soules, had'st thou not crost Thy selfe, and to triumph, thine army lost. Yet though these wayes be lost, thou hast left one, Which is, immoderate griefe that she is gone. But we may scape that sinne, yet weepe as much, Our teares are due, because we are not such. Some teares, that knot of friends, her death must cost, Because the chaine is broke, but no linke lost. To S? Henry Goodyere. Who makes the Past, a patterne for next yeare, Turnes no new leafe, but still the same things reads, Seene things, he sees againe, heard things doth heare, And makes his life, but like a paire of beads. A Palace, when 'tis that, which it should be, Leaves growing, and stands such, or else decayes, But hee which dwels there, is not so; for hee Strives to urge upward, and his fortune raise; So had your body'her morning, hath her noone, And shall not better; her next change is night: But her faire larger guest, to'whom Sun and Moone Are sparkes, and short liv'd, claimes another right. The noble Soule by age growes lustier, Her appetite, and her digestion mend, Wee must not sterve, nor hope to pamper her With womens milke, and pappe unto the end. Provide you manlyer dyet, you have seene All libraries, which are Schools, Camps, &amp; Courts; But aske your Garners if you have not beene In harvests, too indulgent to your sports. Would you redeeme it? then your selfe transplant A while from hence. Perchance outlandish ground Beares no more wit, then ours, but yet more scant Are those diversions there, which here abound. To be a stranger hath that benefit, Wee can beginnings, but not habits choke. Goe, whither? hence; you get, if you forget; New faults, till they prescribe in us, are smoake. Our soule, whose country'is heaven, &amp; God her father, Into this world, corruptions sinke, is sent, Yet, so much in her travaile she doth gather, That she returnes home, wiser then she went; It payes you well, if it teach you to spare, And make you'asham'd, to make your hawks praise, yours, Which when herselfe she lessens in the aire, You then first say, that high enough she toures. However, keepe the lively tast you hold Of God, love him as now, but feare him more, And in your afternoones thinke what you told And promis'd him, at morning prayer before. Let falshood like a discord anger you, Else be not froward; But why doe I touch Things, of which none is in your practise new, And Tables, or fruit-trenchers teach as much; But thus I make you keepe your promise Sir, Riding I had you, though you still staid there, And in these thoughts, although you never stirre, You came with mee to Micham, and are here. To M? Rowland Woodward. Like one who'in her third widdowhood doth professe, Her selfe a Nunne, tyed to retirednesse, So'affects my muse now, a chast fallownesse. Since shee to few, yet to too many'hath showne How love-song weeds, and Satyrique thornes are growne Where seeds of better Arts, were early sown. Though to use, and love Poëtrie, to mee, Betroth'd to no'one Art, be no'adulterie; Omissions of good, ill, as ill deeds bee. For though to us it seeme, 'and be light and thinne, Yet in those faithfull scales, where God throwes in Mens workes, vanity weighs as much as sinne. If our Soules have stain'd their first white, yet wee May cloth them with faith, and deare honestie, Which God imputes, as native puritie, There is no Vertue, but Religion, Wise, valiant, sober, just, are names, which none Want, which want not Vice-covering discretion. Seeke wee then our selves in our selves; for as Men force the Sunne with much more force to passe, By gathering his beames with a christall glasse; So wee, If wee into ourselves will turne, Blowing our sparkes of vertue, may outburne The straw, which doth about our hearts sojourne. You know, Physitians, when they would infuse Into any'oyle, the Soules of Simples, use Places, where they may lie still warme, to chuse. So workes retirednesse in us; to rome Giddily and bee every where, but at home, Such freedome doth a banishment become. Wee are but termers of our selves, yet may, If we can stocke our selves, and thrive, uplay Much, much deare treasure for the great rent day. Manure thy selfe then, to thy selfe be'approv'd, And with vaine outward things be no more mov'd, But to know, that I love thee'and would be lov'd. To S? Henry Wootton. Here's no more newes, then vertue, 'I may as well Tell you Calis, or S? Michaels tale for newes, as tell That vice doth here habitually dwell. Yet, as to'get stomachs, we walke up and downe, And toyle to sweeten rest, so, may God frowne, If, but to loth both, I haunt Court, or Towne. For here no one is from the'extremitie Of vice, by any other reason free, But that the next to'him, still, is worse then hee. In this worlds warfare, they whom rugged Fate, (Gods Commissary,) doth so throughly hate, As in'the Courts Squadron to marshall their state. If they stand arm'd with seely honesty, With wishing prayers, and neat integritie, Like Indians 'gainst Spanish hosts they bee. Suspitious boldnesse to this place belongs, And to'have as many eares as all have tongues; Tender to know, tough to acknowledge wrongs. Beleeve mee Sir, in my youths giddiest dayes, When to be like the Court, was a playes praise, Playes were not so like Courts, as Courts'are like playes. Then let us at these mimicke antiques jeast, Whose deepest projects, and egregious gests Are but dull Moralls of a game at Chests. But now 'tis incongruity to smile, Therefore I end; and bid farewell a while, At Court, though from Court, were the better stile: To the Countesse of Bedford. Madame, Reason is our Soules left hand, Faith her right, By these wee reach divinity, that's you; Their loves, who have the blessings of your light, Grew from their reason, mine from faire faith grew. But as, although a squint lefthandednesse Be'ungracious, yet we cannot want that hand, So would I, not to encrease, but to expresse My faith, as I beleeve, so understand. Therefore I study you first in your Saints, Those friends, whom your election glorifies, Then in your deeds, accesses, and restraints, And what you reade, and what your selfe devize. But soone, the reasons why you'are lov'd by all, Grow infinite, and so passe reasons reach, Then backe againe to'implicite faith I fall, And rest on what the Catholique faith doth teach; That you are good: and not one Heretique Denies it: if he did, yet you are so. For, rockes, which high top'd and deep rooted sticke, Waves wash, not undermine, nor overthrow. In every thing there naturally growes A Balsamum to keepe it fresh, and new, If 'twere not injur'd by extrinsique blowes; Your birth and beauty are this Balme in you. But, you of learning and religion, And vertue, 'and such ingredients, have made A methridate, whose operation Keepes off, or cures what can be done or said. Yet, this is not your physicke, but your food, A dyet fit for you; for you are here The first good Angell, since the worlds frame stood, That ever did in womans shape appeare. Since you are then Gods masterpeece, and so His Factor for our loves; do as you doe, Make your returne home gracious; and bestow Thy life on that; so make one life of two. For so God helpe mee, 'I would not misse you there For all the good which you can do me here. To the Countesse of Bedford. Madame, You have refin'd mee, and to worthyest things Vertue, Art, Beauty, Fortune, now I see Rarenesse, or use, not nature value brings; And such, as they are circumstanc'd, they bee. Two ills can nere perplexe us, sinne to 'excuse; But of two good things, we may leave and chuse. Therefore at Court, which is not vertues clime, (Where a transcendent height, (as, lownesse mee) Makes her not be, or not show: all my rime Your vertues challenge, which there rarest bee; For, as darke texts need notes: there some must bee To usher vertue, and say, This is shee. So in the country'is beauty; to this place You are the season (Madame) you the day, 'Tis but a grave of spices, till your face Exhale them, and a thick close bud display. Widow'd and reclus'd else, her sweets she'enshrines As China, when the Sunne at Brasill dines. Out from your chariot, morning breaks at night, And falsifies both computations so; Since a new world doth rise here from your light, We your new creatures, by new recknings goe. This showes that you from nature lothly stray, That suffer not an artificiall day. In this you'have made the Court the Antipodes, And will'd your Delegate, the vulgar Sunne, To doe profane autumnall offices, Whilst here to you, wee sacrificers runne; And whether Priests, or Organs, you wee'obey, We sound your influence, and your Dictates say. Yet to that Deity which dwels in you, Your vertuous Soule, I now not sacrifice; These are Petitions, and not Hymnes; they sue But that I may survay the edifice. In all Religions as much care hath bin Of Temples frames, and beauty, 'as Rites within. As all which goe to Rome, doe not thereby Esteeme religions, and hold fast the best, But serve discourse, and curiosity, With that which doth religion but invest, And shunne th'entangling laborinths of Schooles, And make it wit, to thinke the wiser fooles: So in this pilgrimage I would behold You as you'are vertues temple, not as shee, What walls of tender christall her enfold, What eyes, hands, bosome, her pure Altars bee; And after this survay, oppose to all Bablers of Chappels, you th'Escuriall. Yet not as consecrate, but merely'as faire; On these I cast a lay and country eye. Of past and future stories, which are rare, I finde you all record, and prophecie. Purge but the booke of Fate, that it admit No sad nor guilty legends, you are it. If good and lovely were not one, of both You were the transcript, and originall, The Elements, the Parent, and the Growth And every peece of you, is both their All, So'intire are all your deeds, and you, that you Must do the same things still: you cannot two. But these (as nice thinne Schoole divinity Serves heresie to furder or represse) Tast of Poëtique rage, or flattery, And need not, where all hearts one truth professe; Oft from new proofes, and new phrase, new doubts grow, As strange attire aliens the men wee know. Leaving then busie praise, and all appeale, To higher Courts, senses decree is true, The Mine, the Magazine, the Commonweale, The story of beauty', in Twicknam is, and you. Who hath seene one, would both; As, who had bin In Paradise, would seeke the Cherubin. To S? Edward Herbert. at Iulyers. Man is a lumpe, where all beasts kneaded bee, Wisdome makes him an Arke where all agree; The foole, in whom these beasts do live at jarre, Is sport to others, and a Theater, Nor scapes hee so, but is himselfe their prey; All which was man in him, is eate away, And now his beasts on one another feed, Yet couple'in anger, and new monsters breed; How happy'is hee, which hath due place assign'd To'his beasts, and disaforested his minde? Empail'd himselfe to keepe them out, not in; Can sow, and dares trust corne, where they have bin; Can use his horse, goate, wolfe, and every beast, And is not Asse himselfe to all the rest. Else, man not onely is the heard of swine, But he's those devills too, which did incline Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse: For man can adde weight to heavens heaviest curse. As Soules (they say) by our first touch, take in The poysonous tincture of Originall sinne, So, to the punishments which God doth fling, Our apprehension contributes the sting. To us, as to his chickins, he doth cast Hemlocke, and wee as men, his hemlocke taste. We do infuse to what he meant for meat, Corrosivenesse, or intense cold or heat. For, God no such specifique poyson hath As kills we know not how; his fiercest wrath Hath no antipathy, but may be good At lest for physicke, if not for our food. Thus man, that might be'his pleasure, is his rod, And is his devill, that might be his God. Since then our businesse is, to rectifie Nature, to what she was, wee'are led awry By them, who man to us in little show, Greater then due, no forme we can bestow On him; for Man into himselfe can draw All, All his faith can swallow, 'or reason chaw. All that is fill'd, and all that which doth fill, All the round world, to man is but a pill, In all it workes not, but it is in all Poysonous, or purgative, or cordiall, For, knowledge kindles Calentures in some, And is to others jcy Opium. As brave as true, is that profession than Which you doe use to make; that you know man. This makes it credible, you have dwelt upon All worthy bookes; and now are such an one. Actions are authors, and of those in you Your friends finde every day a mart of new. To the Countesse of Bedford. T'have written then, when you writ, seem'd to mee Worst of spirituall vices, Simony, And not t'have written then, seemes little lesse Then worst of civill vices, thanklessenesse. In this, my doubt I seem'd loath to confesse, In that, I seem'd to shunne beholdingnesse. But 'tis not soe, nothing, as I am, may, Pay all they have, and yet have all to pay. Such borrow in their payments, and owe more By having leave to write so, then before. Yet since rich mines in barren grounds are showne, May not I yeeld (not gold) but coale or stone? Temples were not demolish'd, though prophane: Here Peter Ioves, there Paul have Dian's Fane. So whether my hymnes you admit or chuse, In me you'have hallowed a Pagan Muse, And denizend a stranger, who mistaught By blamers of the times they mard, hath sought Vertues in corners, which now bravely doe Shine in the worlds best part, or all, in you. I have beene told, that vertue'in Courtiers hearts Suffers an Ostracisme, and departs. Profit, ease, fitnesse, plenty, bid it goe, But whither, only knowing you, I know; Your, or you vertue, two vast uses serves, It ransomes one sex, and one Court preserves; There's nothing but your worth, which being true, Is knowne to any other, not to you. And you can never know it; To admit No knowledge of your worth, it some of it. But since to you, your praises discords bee, Stop others ills, to meditate with mee. Oh! to confesse wee know not what we should, Is halfe excuse, wee know not what we would. Lightnesse depresseth us, emptinesse fills, We sweat and faint, yet still goe downe the hills; As new Philosophy arrests the Sunne, And bids the passive earth about it runne, So wee have dull'd our minde, it hath no ends; Onely the bodie's busie, and pretends; As dead low earth ecclipses and controules The quick high Moone: so doth the body, Soules, In none but us, are such mixt engines found, As hands of double office: For, the ground We till with them; and them to heav'n wee raise; Who prayer-lesse labours, or, without this, prayes, Doth but one halfe, that's none; He which said, Plough And looke not back, to looke up doth allow. Good seed degenerates, and oft obeyes The soyles disease, and into cockle strayes. Let the minds thoughts be but transplanted so, Into the body, 'and bastardly they grow. What hate could hurt our bodies like our love? Wee but no forraigne tyrans could remove, These not ingrav'd, but inborne dignities Caskets of soules; Temples, and Palaces: For, bodies shall from death redeemed bee, Soules but preserv'd, not naturally free; As men to'our prisons, new soules to us are sent, Which learne it there, and come in innocent. First seeds of every creature are in us, What ere the world hath bad, or pretious, Mans body can produce, hence hath it beene That stones, wormes, frogges, and snakes in man are seene But who ere saw, though nature can worke soe, That, pearle, or gold, or corne in man did grow. We'have added to the world Virginia, 'and sent Two new starres lately to the firmament; Why grudge wee us (not heaven) the dignity T'increase with ours, those faire soules company. But I must end this letter, though it doe Stand on two truths, neither is true to you. Vertue hath some perversenesse; For she will Neither beleeve her good, nor others ill, Even in your vertues best paradise, Vertue hath some, but wise degrees of vice. Too many vertues, or too much of one Begets in you unjust suspition. And ignorance of vice, makes vertue lesse, Quenching compassion of our wrechednesse. But these are riddles; Some aspersion Of vice becomes well some complexion. Statesmen purge vice with vice, and may corrode The bad with bad, a spider with a toad: For so, ill thralls not them, but they tame ill And make her do much good against her will, But in your Commonwealth or world in you Vice hath no office, or good worke to doe. Take then no vitious purge, but be content With cordiall vertue, your knowne nourishment. To the Countesse of Bedford. On New-yeares day. This twilight of two yeares, not past nor next, Some embleme is of mee, or I of this, Who Meteor-like, of stuffe and forme perplext, Whose what, and where, in disputation is, If I should call mee any thing, should misse. I summe the yeares, and mee, and finde mee not Debtor to th'old, nor Creditor to th'new, That cannot say, My thankes I have forgot, Nor trust I this with hopes, and yet scarce true, This bravery is since these time shew'd mee you. In recompence I would show future times What you were, and teach them to'urge towards such, Verse embalmes vertue;'and Tombs, or Thrones of rimes, Preserve fraile transitory fame, as much As spice doth bodies from corrupt aires touch. Mine are short liv'd; the tincture of your name Creates in them, but dissipates as fast, New spirit: for, strong agents with the same Force that doth warme and cherish, us doe wast; Kept hot with strong extracts, no bodies last: So, my verse built of your just praise, might want Reason and likelihood, the firmest Base, And made of miracle, now faith is scant, Will vanish soone, and so possesse no place, And you, and it, too much grace might disgrace. When all (as truth commands assent) confesse All truth of you, yet they will doubt how I One corne of one low anthills dust, and lesse, Should name know or expresse a thing so high, And not an inch, measure infinity. I cannot tell them, nor my selfe, nor you, But leave, lest truth b'endanger'd by my praise, And turne to God, who knowes I thinke this true, And useth oft, when such a heart mis-sayes, To make it good, for, such a prayer prayes. Hee will best teach you, how you should lay out His stock of beauty, learning, favour, blood, He will perplex security with doubt, And cleare those doubts, hide from you, 'and shew you good, And so increase your appetite and food; Hee will teach you, that good and bad have not One latitude in cloysters, and in Court, Indifferent there the greatest space hath got, Some pitty'is not good there, some vaine disport, On this side, sinne; with that place may comport. Yet he as hee bounds seas, will fixe your houres, With pleasure, and delight may not ingresse, And though what none else lost, be truliest yours, Hee will make you, what you did not, possesse, By using others, not vice, but weakenesse. He will make you speake truths, and credibly, And make you doubt, that others doe not so: Hee will provide you keyes, and locks, to spie, And scape spies, to good ends, and hee will show What you may not acknowledge, what not know. For your owne conscience, he gives innocence, But for your fame, a discreet warinesse, And though to scape, then to revenge offence Be better, he showes both, and to represse Ioy, when your state swells, sadnesse when 'tis lesse. From need of teares he will defend your soule, Or make a rebaptizing of one teare; Hee cannot, (that's, he will not) dis-inroule Your name; and when with active joy we heare This private Ghospell, then 'tis our new yeare, To the Countesse of Huntingdon. Madame, Man to Gods image, Eve, to mans was made, Nor finde wee that God breath'd a soule in her, Canons will not Church functions you invade, Nor lawes to civill office you preferre. Who vagrant transitory Comets sees, Wonders, because they'are rare; But a new starre Whose motion with the firmament agrees, Is miracle; for, there no new things are; In woman so perchance milde innocence A seldome comet is, but active good A miracle, which reason scapes, and sense; For, Art and Nature this in them withstood. As such a starre, which Magi led to view The manger-cradled infant, God below. By vertues beames by fame deriv'd from you, May apt soules, and the worst may vertue know. If the worlds age, and death be argued well By the Sunnes fall, which now towards earth doth bend, Then we might feare that vertue, since she fell So low as woman, should be neare her end. But she's not stoop'd, but rais'd; exil'd by men She fled to heaven, that's heavenly things, that's you, She was in all men, thinly scatter'd then, But now amass'd, contracted in a few. She guilded us: But you are gold, and Shee, Us she inform'd, but transubstantiates you, Soft dispositions which ductile bee, Elixarlike, she makes not cleane, but new. Though you a wifes and mothers name retaine, 'Tis not as woman, for all are not soe, But vertue having made you vertue, 'is faine T'adhere in these names, her and you to show, Else, being alike pure, wee should neither see, As, water being into ayre rarify'd, Neither appeare, till in one cloud they bee, So, for our sakes you do low names abide; Taught by great constellations, which being fram'd, Of the most starres, take low names, Crab, and Bull, When single planets by the Gods are nam'd, You covet not great names, of great things full. So you, as woman, one doth comprehend, And in the vaile of kindred others see; To some ye are reveal'd, as in a friend, And as a vertuous Prince farre off, to mee. To whom, because from you all vertues flow, And 'tis not none, to dare contemplate you, I, which to you as your true subject owe Some tribute for that, so these lines are due, If you can thinke these flatteries, they are, For then your judgement is below my praise, If they were so, oft, flatteries worke as farre, As Counsels, and as farre th'endeavour raise. So my ill reaching you might there grow good, But I remaine a poyson'd fountaine still; But not your beauty, vertue, knowledge, blood Are more above all flattery, then my will. And if I flatter any, 'tis not you But my owne judgement, who did long agoe Pronounce, that all these praises should be true, And vertue should your beauty, and birth outgrow. Now that my prophesies are all fulfill'd, Rather then God should not be honour'd too, And all these gifts confess'd, which hee instill'd, Your selfe were bound to say thar which I doe. So I, but your Recorder am in this, Or mouth, or Speaker of the universe, A ministeriall notary, for 'tis Not I, but you and fame, that make this verse; I was your Prophet in your yonger dayes, And now your Chaplaine, God in you to praise. To M.I. W. All haile sweet Poët, more full of more strong fire, Then hath or shall enkindle any spirit, I lov'd what nature gave thee, but this merit Of wit and Art I love not but admire; Who have before or shall write after thee, Their workes, though toughly laboured, will bee Like infancie or age to mans firme stay, Or earely and late twilights to mid-day. Men say, and truly, that they better be Which be envyed then pittied: therefore I, Because I wish thee best, doe thee envie: O wouldst thou, by like reason, pitty mee, But care not for mee, I, that ever was In Natures, and in fortunes gifts, (alas, Before thy grace got in the Muses Schoole) A monster and a begger, am a foole. Oh how I grieve, that late borne modesty Hath got such root in easie waxen hearts, That men may not themselves, their owne good parts Extoll, without suspect of surquedrie, For, but thy selfe, no subject can be found Worthy thy quill, nor any quill resound Thy worke but thine: how good it were to see A Poëm in thy praise, and writ by thee. Now if this song be too'harsh for rime, yet, as The Painters bad god made a good devill, 'Twill be good prose, although the verse be evill. If thou forget the rime as thou dost passe, Then write, then I may follow, and so bee Thy debter, thy'eccho, thy foyle, thy zanee. I shall be thought, if mine like thine I shape, All the worlds Lyon, though I be thy Ape. To M.T. W. Hast thee harsh verse as fast as thy lame measure Will give thee leave, to him; My pain, &amp; pleasure I have given thee, and yet thou art too weake, Feete and a reasoning soule and tongue to speake. Tell him, all questions, which men have defended Both of the place and paines of hell, are ended; And 'tis decreed our hell is but privation Of him, at least in this earths habitation: And 'tis where I am, where in every street Infections follow, overtake, and meete: Live I or die, by you my love is sent, And you'are my pawnes, or else my Testament. To M.T. W. Pregnant again with th'old twins Hope, and Feare, Oft have I askt for thee, both how and where Thou wert, and what my hopes of letters were; As in our streets sly beggers narrowly Watch motions of the givers hand or eye, And evermore conceive some hope thereby. And now thy Almes is given, thy letter'is read, The body risen againe, the which was dead, And thy poore starveling bountifully fed. After this banquet my Soule doth say grace, And praise thee for'it, and zealously imbrace Thy love, though I thinke thy love in this case To be as gluttons, which say 'midst their meat, They love that best of which they most do eat. At once, from hence, my lines and I depart, I to my soft still walks, they to my Heart; I to the Nurse, they to the child of Art; Yet as a firme house, though the Carpenter Perish, doth stand: as an Embassadour Lyes safe, how e'r his king be in danger: So, though I languish, prest with Malancholy, My verse, the strict Map of my misery, Shall live to see that, for whose want I dye. Therefore I envie them, and doe repent, That from unhappy mee, things happy'are sent; Yet as a Picture, or bare Sacrament, Accept these lines, and if in them there be Merit of love bestow that love on mee. To M.C. B. Thy friend, whom thy deserts to thee enchaine, Urg'd by this unexcusable occasion, Thee and the Saint of his affection Leaving behinde, doth of both wants complaine; And let the love I beare to both sustaine No blott nor maime by this division, Strong is this love which ties our hearts in one, And strong that love pursu'd with amorous paine; But though besides thy selfe I leave behind Heavens liberall and earths thrice-faire Sunne, Going to where sterne winter aye doth wonne, Yet, loves hot fires, which martyr my sad minde, Doe send forth scalding sighes, which have the Art To melt all Ice, but that which walls her heart. To M.S. B. O thou which to search out the secret parts Of the India, or rather Paradise Of knowledge, hast with courage and advise Lately launch'd into the vast Sea of Arts, Disdaine not in thy constant travailing To doe as other Voyagers, and make Some turnes into lesse Creekes, and wisely take Fresh water at the Heliconian spring; I sing not, Siren like, to tempt; for I Am harsh, nor as those Scismatiques with you, Which draw all wits of good hope to their crew; But seing in you bright sparkes of Poetry, I, though I brought no fuell, had desire With these Articulate blasts to blow the fire. To M.B. B. Is not thy sacred hunger of science Yet satisfy'd? Is not thy braines rich hive Fulfil'd with hony which thou dost derive From the Arts spirits and their Quintessence? Then weane thy selfe at last, and thee withdraw From Cambridge thy old nurse, and, as the rest, Here toughly chew, and sturdily digest Th'immense vast volumes of our common law; And begin soone, lest my griefe grieve thee too, Which is, that that which I should have begun In my youthes morning, now late must be done; And I, as Giddy Travellers, must doe, Which stray or sleepe all day, and having lost Light and strength, darke and tir'd must then ride post. If thou unto thy Muse be marryed, Embrace her ever, ever multiply, Be far from me that strange Adulterie To tempt thee and procure her widdowhood, My nurse, (for I had one,) because I'am cold, Divorc'd her selfe, the cause being in me, That I can take no new in Bigamye, Not my will only but power doth withhold. Hence comes it, that these Rymes which never had Mother, want matter, aud they only have A little forme, the which their Father gave; They are prophane, imperfect, oh, too bad To be counted Children of Poetry Except confirm'd and Bishoped by thee. To M.R. W. If, as mine is, thy life a slumber be, Seeme, when thou read'st these lines, to dreame of me, Never did Morpheus nor his brother weare Shapes soe like those Shapes, whom they would appeare, As this my letter is like me, for it Hath my name, words, hand, feet, heart, minde and wit; It is my deed of gift of mee to thee, It is my Will, my selfe the Legacie. So thy retyrings I love, yea envie, Bred in thee by a wise melancholy, That I rejoyce, that unto where thou art, Though I stay here, I can thus send my heart, As kindly'as any enamored Patient His Picture to his absent Love hath sent. All newes I thinke sooner reach thee then mee; Havens are Heavens, and Ships wing'd Angels be, The which both Gospell, and sterne threatnings bring; Guyanaes harvest is nip'd in the spring, I feare; And with us (me thinkes) Fate deales so As with the Jewes guide God did; he did show Him the rich land, but bar'd his entry in, Our slownes is our punishment and sinne; Perchance, these Spanish businesse being done, Which as the Earth betweene the Moone and Sun Eclipse the light which Guyana would give, Our discontinued hopes we shall retrive: But if (as All th'All must) hopes smoake away, Is not Almightie Vertue'an India? If men be worlds, there is in every one Some thing to answere in some proportion All the worlds riches: And in good men, this Vertue, our formes forme and our soules soule is. To M.I. L. Of that short Roll of friends writ in my heart Which with thy name begins, since their depart, Whether in the English Provinces they be, Or drinke of Po, Sequan, or Danubie, There's none that sometimes greets us not, and yet Your Trent is Lethe', that past, us you forget, You doe not duties of Societies, If from the'embrace of a lov'd wife you rise, View your fat Beasts, stretch'd Barnes, and labour'd fields, Eate, play, ryde, take all joyes which all day yeelds, And then againe to your embracements goe: Some houres on us your frends, and some bestow Upon your Muse, else both wee shall repent, I that my love, she that her guifts on you are spent. To M.I. P. Blest are your North parts, for all this long time My Sun is with you, cold and darke'is our Clime; Heavens Sun, which staid so long from us this yeare, Staid in your North (I thinke) for she was there, And hether by kinde nature drawne from thence, Here rages chafes and threatens pestilence; Yet I, as long as shee from hence doth staie, Thinke this no South, no Sommer, nor no day. With thee my kinde and unkinde heart is run, There sacrifice it to that beauteous Sun: So may thy pastures with their flowery feasts, As suddenly as Lard, fat thy leane beasts; So may thy woods oft poll'd, yet ever weare A greene, and when thee list a golden haire; So may all thy sheepe bring forth Twins; and so In chace and race may thy horse all out goe; So may thy love and courage ne'r be cold; Thy Sonne ne'r Ward; Thy lov'd wife ne'r seem old; But maist thou wish great things, and them attaine, As thou telst her and none but her my paine. To E. of D. with six holy Sonnets. See Sir, how as the Suns hot Masculine flame Begets strange creatures on Niles durty slime, In me, your fatherly yet lusty Ryme (For, these songs are their fruits) have wrought the same; But though the ingendring force from whence they came Bee strong enough, and nature doe admit Seaven to be borne at once, I send as yet But six, they say, the seaventh hath still some maime; I choose your judgement, which the same degree Doth with her sister, your invention, hold, As fire these drossie Rymes to purifie, Or as Elixar, to change them to gold; You are that Alchimist which alwaies had Wit, whose one spark could make good things of bad. To Sir H. W. at his going Ambassador to Venice. After those reverend papers, whose soule is Our good and great Kings lov'd hand and fear'd name By which to you he derives much of his, And (how he may) makes you almost the same, A Taper of his Torch, a copie writ From his Originall, and a faire beame Of the same warme, and dazeling Sun, though it Must in another Sphere his vertue streame: After those learned papers which your hand Hath stor'd with notes of use and pleasures too, From which rich treasury you may command Fit matter whether you will write or doe: After those loving papers, where friends send With glad griefe, to your Sea-ward steps, farewel, Which thicken on you now, as prayers ascend To heaven in troupes at'a good mans passing bell: Admit this honest paper, and allow It such an audience as your selfe would aske; What you must say at Venice this meanes now, And hath for nature, what you have for taske. To sweare much love, not to be chang'd before Honour alone will to your fortune fit; Nor shall I then honour your fortune, more Then I have done your honour wanting it. But 'tis an easier load (though both oppresse) To want, then governe greatnesse, for wee are In that, our owne and onely businesse, In this, wee must for others vices care; 'Tis therefore well your spirits now are plac'd In their last Furnace, in activity; Which fits them (Schooles and Courts and warres o'rpast) To touch and test in any best degree. For mee, (if there be such a thing as I) Fortune (if there be such a thing as shee) Spies that I beare so well her tyranny, That she thinks nothing else so fit for mee; But though she part us, to heare my oft prayers For your increase, God is as neere mee here; And to send you what I shall begge, his staires In length and ease are alike every where. To M.M. H. Mad paper stay, and grudge not here to burne With all those sonnes whom my braine did create, At lest lye hid with mee, till thou returne. To rags againe, which is thy native state. What though thou have enough unworthinesse To come unto great place as others doe, That's much, emboldens, pulls, thrusts I confesse, But 'tis not all, thou should'st be wicked too. And, that thou canst not learne, or not of mee; Yet thou wilt goe, Goe, since thou goest to her Who lacks but faults to be a Prince, for shee, Truth, whom they dare not pardon, dares preferre. But when thou com'st to that perplexing eye Which equally claimes love and reverence. Thou wilt not long dispute it, thou wilt die; And, having little now, have then no sense. Yet when her warme redeeming hand, which is A miracle; and made such to worke more, Doth touch thee (saples leafe) thou grow'st by this Her creature; glorify'd more then before. Then as a mother which delights to heare Her early child mispeake halfe uttered words, Or, because majesty doth never feare Ill or bold speech, she Audience affords. And then, cold speechlesse wretch, thou diest againe, And wisely; what discourse is left for thee? For, speech of ill, and her thou must abstaine, And is there any good which is not shee? Yet maist thou praise her servants, though not her, And wit, and vertue, 'and honour her attend, And since they'are but her cloathes, thou shalt not erre If thou her shape and beauty'and grace commend. Who knowes thy destiny? when thou hast done, Perchance her Cabinet may harbour thee, Whither all noble ambitious wits doe runne, A nest almost as full of Good as shee. When thou art there, if any, whom wee know, Were sav'd before, and did that heaven partake, When she revolves his papers, marke what show Of favour, she alone, to them doth make. Marke, if to get them, she o'r skip the rest, Marke, if shee read them twice, or kisse the name; Marke, if she doe the same that they protest, Marke, if she marke whether her woman came. Marke, if slight things be'objected, and o'r blowne, Marke, if her oathes against him be not still Reserv'd, and that shee grieves she's not her owne, And chides the doctrine that denies Freewill. I bid thee not doe this to be my spie; Nor to make my selfe her familiar; But so much I doe love her choyce, that I Would faine love him that shall be lov'd of her. To the Countesse of Bedford. Honour is so sublime perfection, And so refinde; that when God was alone And creaturelesse at first, himselfe had none; But as of the elements, these which wee tread, Produce all things with which wee'are joy'd or fed, And, those are barren both above our head: So from low persons doth all honour flow; Kings, whom they would have honoured, to us show, And but direct our honour, not bestow. For when from herbs the pure part must be wonne From grosse, by Stilling, this is better done By despis'd dung, then by the fire or Sunne. Care not then, Madame, 'how low your prayses lye; In labourers balads oft more piety God findes, then in Te Deums melodie. And, ordinance rais'd on Towers so many mile Send not their voice, nor last so long a while As fires from th'earths low vaults in Sicil Isle. Should I say I liv'd darker then were true, Your radiation can all clouds subdue, But one, 'tis best light to contemplate you. You, for whose body God made better clay, Or tooke Soules stuffe such as shall late decay, Or such as needs small change at the last day. This, as an Amber drop enwraps a Bee, Covering discovers your quicke Soule; that we May in your through-shine front our hearts thoughts see. You teach (though wee learne not) a thing unknowne To our late times, the use of specular stone, Through which all things within without were shown. Of such were Temples; so and such you are; Beeing and seeming is your equall care, And vertues whole summe is but know and dare. But as our Soules of growth and Soules of sense Have birthright of our reasons Soule, yet hence They fly not from that, nor seeke presidence. Natures first lesson, so, discretion, Must not grudge zeale a place, nor yet keepe none, Not banish it selfe, nor religion. Discretion is a wisemans Soule, and so Religion is a Christians, and you know How these are one, her yea, is not her no. Nor may we hope to sodder still and knit These two, and dare to breake them; nor must wit Be colleague to religion, but be it. In those poore types of God (round circles) so Religions tipes, the peeclesse centers flow, And are in all the lines which alwayes goe. If either ever wrought in you alone Or principally, then religion Wrought your ends, and your wayes discretion. Goe thither stil, goe the same way you went, Who so would change, do covet or repent; Neither can reach you, great and innocent. To the Countesse of Bedford. Begun in France but never perfected. Though I be dead, and buried, yet I have (Living in you,) Court enough in my grave, As oft as there I thinke my selfe to bee, So many resurrections waken mee. That thankfullnesse your favours have forgot In mee, embalmes mee; that I doe not rot; This season as 'tis Easter, as 'tis spring, Must both to growth and to confession bring My thoughts dispos'd unto your influence, so, These verses bud, so these confessions grow; First I confesse I have to others lent Your stock, and over prodigally spent Your treasure, for since I had never knowne Vertue or beautie, but as they are growne In you, I should not thinke or say they shine, (So as I have) in any other Mine; Next I confesse this my confession, For, 'tis some fault thus much to touch upon, Your praise to you, where half rights seeme too much, And make your minds sincere complexion blush. Next I confesse my'impenitence, for I Can scarce repent my first fault, since thereby Remote low Spirits, which shall ne'r read you, May in lesse lessons finde enough to doe, By studying copies, not Originals, Desunt cætera. A Letter to the Lady Carey, and M?? Essex Riche, From Amyens. Madame, Here where by All All Saints invoked are, 'Twere too much schisme to be singular, And 'gainst a practise generall to warre. Yet turning to Saincts; should my'humility To other Sainct then you directed bee, That were to make my schisme, heresie. Nor would I be a Convertite so cold, As not to tell it; If this be too bold, Pardons are in this market cheaply sold. Where, because Faith is in too low degree, I thought it some Apostleship in mee To speake things which by faith alone I see. That is, of you, who is a firmament Of virtues, where no one is growne, or spent, They'are your materials, not your ornament. Others whom wee call vertuous, are not so In their whole substance, but, their vertues grow But in their humours, and at seasons show. For when through tastlesse flat humilitie In dow bak'd men some harmelessenes we see, 'Tis but his flegme that's Vertuous, and not Hee: Soe is the Blood sometimes; who ever ran To danger unimportun'd, he was than No better then a sanguine Vertuous man. So cloysterall men, who, in pretence of feare All contributions to this life forbeare, Have Vertue in Melancholy, and only there. Spirituall Cholerique Crytiques, which in all Religions find faults, and forgive no fall, Have, through their zeale, Vertue but in their Gall. We are thus but parcel guilt; to Gold we'are growne When Vertue is our Soules complexion; Who knowes his Vertues name or place, hath none. Vertue'is but aguish, when 'tis severall, By occasion wak'd, and circumstantiall. True vertue is Soule, Alwaies in all deeds All. This Vertue thinking to give dignitie To your soule, found there no infirmitie, For, your soule was as good Vertue, as shee; Shee therefore wrought upon that part of you Which is scarce lesse then soule, as she could do, And so hath made your beauty, Vertue too. Hence comes it, that your Beauty wounds not hearts, As Others, with prophane and sensuall Darts, But as an influence, vertuous thoughts imparts. But if such friends by the honor of your sight Grow capable of this so great a light, As to partake your vertues, and their might, What must I thinke that influence must doe, Where it findes sympathie and matter too, Vertue, and beauty of the same stuffe, as you? Which is, your noble worthie sister, shee Of whom, if what in this my Extasie And revelation of you both I see, I should write here, as in short Galleries The Master at the end large glasses ties, So to present the roome twice to our eyes, So I should give this letter length, and say That which I said of you, there is no way From either, but by the other not to stray. May therefore this be enough to testifie My true devotion, free from flattery; He that beleeves himselfe, doth never lie. To the Countesse of Salisbury. August, 1614. Faire, great, and good, since seeing you, wee see What Heaven can doe, and what any Earth can be: Since now your beauty shines, now when the Sunne Growne stale, is to so low a value runne, That his disshevel'd beames and scattered fires Serve but for Ladies Periwigs and Tyres In lovers Sonnets: you come to repaire Gods booke of creatures, teaching what is faire. Since now, when all is withered, shrunke, and dri'd, All Vertues ebb'd out to a dead low tyde, All the worlds frame being crumbled into sand, Where every man thinks by himselfe to stand, Integritie, friendship, and confidence, (Ciments of greatnes) being vapor'd hence, And narrow man being fill'd with little shares, Court, Citie, Church, are all shops of small-wares, All having blowne to sparkes their noble fire, And drawne their sound gold-ingot into wyre; All trying by a love of littlenesse To make abridgments, and to draw to lesse, Even that nothing, which at first we were; Since in these times, your greatnesse doth appeare, And that we learne by it, that man to get Towards him, thats infinite, must first be great. Since in an age so ill, as none is fit So much as to accuse, much lesse mend it, (For who can judge, or witnesse of those times Where all alike are guiltie of the crimes?) Where he that would be good, is thought by all A monster, or at best fantasticall: Since now you durst be good, and that I doe Discerne, by daring to contemplate you, That there may be degrees of faire, great, good, Through your light, largenesse, vertue understood. If in this sacrifice of mine, be showne Any small sparke of these, call it your owne. And if things like these, have been said by mee Of others; call not that Idolatrie. For had God made man first, and man had seene The third daies fruits, and flowers, and various greene He might have said the best that he could say Of those faire creatures, which were made that day: And when next day he had admir'd the birth Of Sun, Moone, Stars, fairer then late-prais'd earth, Hee might have said the best that he could say, And not be chid for praising yesterday: So though some things are not together true, As, that another is worthiest, and, that you: Yet, to say so, doth not condemne a man, If when he spoke them, they were both true than. How faire a proofe of this, in our soule growes? Wee first have soules of growth, and sense, and those, When our last soule, our soule immortall came, Were swallowed into it, and have no name. Nor doth he injure those soules, which doth cast The power and praise of both them, on the last; No more doe I wrong any; I adore The same things now, which I ador'd before, The subject chang'd, and measure; the same thing In a low constable, and in the King I reverence; His power to worke on mee; So did I humbly reverence each degree Of faire, great, good, but more, now I am come From having found their walkes, to finde their home. And as I owe my first soules thankes, that they For my last soule did fit and mould my clay, So am I debtor unto them, whose worth, Enabled me to profit, and take forth This new great lesson, thus to study you; Which none, not reading others, first, could doe, Nor lacke I light to read this booke, though I In a darke Cave, yea in a Grave doe lie; For as your fellow Angells, so you doe Illustrate them who come to study you. The first whom we in Histories doe finde To have profest all Arts, was one borne blind: He lackt those eyes beasts have as well as wee, Not those, by which Angels are seene and see; So, though I'am borne without those eyes to live, Which fortune, who hath none her selfe, doth give, Which are, fit meanes to see bright courts and you, Yet may I see you thus, as now I doe; I shall by that, all goodnesse have discern'd, And though I burne my librarie, be learn'd. An Epithalamion, Or mariage Song on the Lady Elizabeth, and Count Palatine being married on St. Valentines day. I Haile Bishop Valentine, whose day this is, All the Aire is thy Diocis, And all the chirping Choristers And other birds are thy Parishioners, Thou marryest every yeare The Lirique Larke, and the grave whispering Dove, The Sparrow that neglects his life for love, The household Bird, with the red stomacher, Thou mak'st the black bird speed as soone, As doth the Goldfinch, or the Halcyon; The husband cocke lookes out, and straight is sped, And meets his wife, which brings her feather-bed. This day more cheerfully then ever shine. This day, which might enfl?e thy self, Old Valentine. II Till now, Thou warmd'st with multiplying loves Two larkes, two sparrowes, or two Doves, All that is nothing unto this, For thou this day couplest two Phœnixes, Thou mak'st a Taper see What the sunne never saw, and what the Arke (Which was of foules, and beasts, the cage, and park,) Did not containe, one bed containes, through Thee, Two Phœnixes, whose joyned breasts Are unto one another mutuall nests, Where motion kindles such fires, as shall give Yong Phœnixes, and yet the old shall live. Whose love and courage never shall decline, But make the whole year through, thy day, O Val?tine. III Up then faire Phœnix Bride, frustrate the Sunne, Thy selfe from thine affection Takest warmth enough, and from thine eye All lesser birds will take their Jollitie. Up, up, faire Bride, and call, Thy starres, from out their severall boxes, take Thy Rubies, Pearles, and Diamonds forth, and make Thy selfe a constellation, of them All, And by their blazing, signifie, That a Great Princess falls, but doth nor die; Bee thou a new starre, that to us portends Ends of much wonder; And be Thou those ends, Since thou dost this day in new glory shine, May all men date Records, from this thy Valentine. IIII Come forth, come forth, and as one glorious flame Meeting Another, growes the same, So meet thy Fredericke, and so To an unseparable union goe, Since separation Falls not on such things as are infinite, Nor things which are but one, can disunite. You'are twice inseparable, great, and one; Goe then to where the Bishop staies, To make you one, his way, which divers waies Must be effected; and when all is past, And that you'are one, by hearts and hands made fast, You two have one way left, your selves to'entwine, Besides this Bishops knot, O Bishop Valentine. V But oh, what ailes the Sunne, that here he staies, Longer to day, then other daies? Staies he new light from these to get? And finding here such store, is loth to set? And why doe you two walke, So slowly pac'd in this procession? Is all your care but to be look'd upon, And be to others spectacle, and talke? The feast, with gluttonous delaies, Is eaten, and too long their meat they praise, The masquers come too late, and'I thinke, will stay, Like Fairies, till the Cock crow them away. Alas, did not Antiquity assigne A night, as well as day, to thee, O Valentine? VI They did, and night is come; and yet wee see Formalities retarding thee. What meane these Ladies, which (as though They were to take a clock in peeces,) goe So nicely about the Bride; A Bride, before a good night could be said, Should vanish from her cloathes, into her bed, As Soules from bodies steale, and are not spy'd. But now she is laid; What though shee bee? Yet there are more delayes, For, where is he? He comes, and passes through Spheare after Spheare. First her sheetes, then her Armes, then any where, Let not this day, then, but this night be thine, Thy day was but the eve to this, O Valentine. VII Here lyes a shee Sunne, and a hee Moone here, She gives the best light to his Spheare, Or each is both, and all, and so They unto one another nothing owe, And yet they doe, but are So just and rich in that coyne which they pay, That neither would, nor needs forbeare nor stay, Neither desires to be spar'd, nor to spare, They quickly pay their debt, and then Take no acquittance, but pay again; They pay, they give, they lend, and so let fall, No such occasion to be liberall. More truth, more courage in these two do shine, Then all thy turtles have, and sparrows, Valentine. VIII And by this act of these two Phenixes Nature againe restored is, For since these two are two no more, Ther's but one Phenix still, as was before. Rest now at last, and wee As Satyres watch the Sunnes uprise, will stay Waiting, when your eyes opened, let out day. Onely desir'd, because your face wee see; Others neare you shall whispering speake, And wagers lay, at which side day will breake, And win by'observing, then, whose hand it is That opens first a curtaine, hers or his; This will be tryed to morrow after nine, Till which houre, wee thy day enlarge, O Valentine. ECCLOGUE. [Vnseasonable man, statue of ice] 1613. December 26. Allophanes finding Idios in the country in Christmas time, reprehends his absence from court, at the mariage of the Earle of Sommerset, Idios gives an account of his purpose therein, and of his absence thence. Allophanes. Vnseasonable man, statue of ice, What could to countries solitude entice Thee, in this yeares cold and decrepit time? Natures instinct drawes to the warmer clime Even small birds, who by that courage dare, In numerous fleets, saile through their Sea, the aire. What delicacie can in fields appeare, Whil'st Flora'herselfe doth a freeze jerkin weare? Whil'st windes do all the trees and hedges strip Of leafes, to furnish roddes enough to whip Thy madnesse from thee; and all springs by frost Have taken cold, and their sweet murmures lost; If thou thy faults or fortunes would'st lament With just solemnity, do it in Lent; At Court the spring already advanced is, The Sunne stayes longer up; and yet not his The glory is, farre other, other fires. First, zeale to Prince and State; then loves desires Burne in one brest, and like heavens two great lights, The first doth governe dayes, the other nights. And then that early light, which did appeare Before the Sunne and Moone created were; The Princes favour is defus'd o'r all, From which all Fortunes, Names, and Natures fall; Then from those wombes of starres, the Brides bright eyes, At every glance, a constellation flyes, And sowes the Court with starres, and doth prevent In light and power, the all-ey'd firmament; First her eyes kindles other Ladies eyes, Then from their beames their jewels lusters rise, And from their jewels torches do take fire, And all is warmth, and light, and good desire; Most other Courts, alas, are like to hell, Where in darke places, fire without light doth dwell: Or but like Stoves, for lust and envy get Continuall, but artificiall heat; Here zeale and love growne one, all clouds disgest, And make our Court an everlasting East, And can'st thou be from thence? Idios. No, I am there As heaven, to men dispos'd, is every where, So are those Courts, whose Princes animate, Not onely all their house, but all their State, Let no man thinke, because he is full, he hath all, Kings (as their patterne, God) are liberall Not onely in fulnesse, but capacitie, Enlarging narrow men, to feele and see, And comprehend the blessings they bestow. So, reclus'd hermits often times do know More of heavens glory, then a worldling can. As man is of the world, the heart of man, Is an epitome of Gods great booke Of creatures, and man need no farther looke; So is the Country of Courts, where sweet peace doth, As their one common soule, give life to both, I am not then from Court. Allophanes. Dreamer, thou art, Think'st thou fantastique that thou hast a part In the Indian fleet, because thou hast A little spice, or Amber in thy taste? Because thou art not frozen, art thou warme? Seest thou all good because thou seest no harme? The earth doth in her inner bowels hold Stuffe well dispos'd; and which would faine be gold, But never shall, except it chance to lye, So upward, that heaven gild it with his eye; As, for divine things, faith comes from above, So, for best civill use, all tinctures move From higher powers; From God religion springs, Wisdome, and honour from the use of Kings. Then unbeguile thy selfe, and know with mee, That Angels, though on earth employd they bee, Are still in heav'n, so is hee still at home That doth, abroad, to honest actions come. Chide thy selfe then, O foole, which yesterday Might'st have read more then all thy books bewray; Hast thou a history, which doth present A Court, where all affections do assent Unto the Kings, and that, that Kings are just? And where it is no levity to trust. Where there is no ambition, but to'obey, Where men need whisper nothing, and yet may; Where the Kings favours are so plac'd, that all Finde that the King therein is liberall To them, in him, because his favours bend To vertue, to the which they all pretend. Thou hast no such; yet here was this, and more, An earnest lover, wise then, and before, Our little Cupid hath sued Livery, And is no more in his minority, Hee is admitted now into that brest Where the Kings Counsells and his secrets rest, What hast thou lost, O ignorant man? Idios. I knew, All this, and onely therefore I withdrew To know and feele all this, and not to have Words to expresse it, makes a man a grave Of his owne thoughts; I would not therefore stay At a great feast, having no grace to say, And yet I scap'd not here; for being come Full of the common joy; I utter'd some, Reade then this nuptiall song, which was not made Either the Court or mens hearts to invade, But since I'am dead, and buried I could frame No Epitaph, which might advance my fame, So much as this poore song, which testifies I did unto that day some sacrifice. [Thou art repriv'd old yeare, thou shalt not die] I. The time of the Mariage. Thou art repriv'd old yeare, thou shalt not die, Though thou upon thy death bed lye, And should'st within five dayes expire Yet thou art rescu'd by a mightier fire, Then thy old Soule, the Sunne, When he doth in his largest circle runne. The passage of the West or East would thaw, And open wide their easie liquid jawe To all our ships, could a Promethean art Either unto the Northerne Pole impart The fire of these inflaming eyes, or of this loving heart. II. Equality of persons. But undiscerning Muse, which heart, which eyes, In this new couple, dost thou prize, When his eye as inflaming is As hers, and her heart loves as well as his? Be tryed by beauty, and than The bridegroome is a maid, and not a man, If by that manly courage they be tryed, Which scornes unjust opinion; then the bride Becomes a man. Should chance or envies Art Divide these two, whom nature scarce did part? Since both have th'enflaming eye, and both the loving heart. III. Raysing of the Bridegroome. Though it be some divorce to thinke of you Single, so much one are you two, Let me here contemplate thee, First, cheerfull Bridegroome, and first let mee see, How thou prevent'st the Sunne, And his red foming horses dost outrunne, How, having laid downe in thy Soveraignes brest All businesses, from thence to reinvest Them, when these triumphs cease, thou forward art To shew to her, who doth the like impart, The fire of thy inflaming eyes, and of thy loving heart. IIII. Raising of the Bride. But now, to Thee, faire Bride, it is some wrong, To thinke thou wert in Bed so long, Since Soone thou lyest downe first, tis fit Thou in first rising should'st allow for it, Pouder thy Radiant haire, Which if without such ashes thou would'st weare, Thou, which, to all which come to looke upon, Are meant for, Phœbus, would'st be Phaëton, For our ease, give thine eyes, th'unusuall part Of joy, a Teare; so quencht, thou maist impart, To us that come, thy inflaming eyes, to him, thy loving heart. V. Her Apparrelling. Thus thou descend'st to our infirmitie, Who can the Sun in water see. Soe dost thou, when in silke and gold, Thou cloudst thy selfe; since wee which doe behold, Are dust, and wormes, 'tis just Our objects be the fruits of wormes and dust; Let every Jewell be a glorious starre, Yet starres are not so pure, as their spheares are. And though thou stoope, to'appeare to us, in part, Still in that Picture thou intirely art, Which thy inflaming eyes have made within his loving heart. VI. Going to the Chappell. Now from your Easts you issue forth, and wee, As men which through a Cipres see The rising sun, doe thinke it two, Soe, as you goe to Church, doe thinke of you, But that vaile being gone, By the Church rites you are from thenceforth one. The Church Triumphant made this match before, And now the Militant doth strive no more, Then, reverend Priest, who Gods Recorder art, Doe, from his Dictates, to these two impart All blessings, which are seene, Or thought, by Angels eye or heart. VII. The Benediction. Blest payre of Swans, Oh may you interbring Daily new joyes, and never sing, Live, till all grounds of wishes faile, Till honor, yea till wisedome grow so stale, That, new great heights to trie, It must serve your ambition, to die; Raise heires, and may here, to the worlds end, live Heires from this King, to take thankes, you, to give, Nature and grace doe all, and nothing Art, May never age, or error overthwart With any West, these radiant eyes, with any North, this heart. VIII. Feasts and Revells. But you are over-blest. Plenty this day Injures; it causeth time to stay; The tables groane, as though this feast Would, as the flood, destroy all fowle and beast. And were the doctrine new That the earth mov'd, this day would make it true; For every part to dance and revell goes. They tread the ayre, and fal not where they rose. Though six houres since, the Sunne to bed did part, The masks and banquets will not yet impart A sunset to these weary eyes, A Center to this heart. IX. The Brides going to bed. What mean'st thou Bride, this companie to keep? To sit up, till thou faine wouldst sleep? Thou maist not, when thou art laid, doe so. Thy selfe must to him a new banquet grow, And you must entertaine And doe all this daies dances o'r againe. Know that if Sun and Moone together doe Rise in one point, they doe not set so to. Therefore thou maist, faire Bride, to bed depart, Thou art not gone, being gone, where e'r thou art, Thou leav'st in him thy watchfull eyes, in him thy loving heart. X. The Bridegroomes comming. As he that sees a starre fall, runs apace, And findes a gellie in the place, So doth the Bridegroome hast as much, Being told this starre is falne, and findes her such, And as friends may looke strange, By a new fashion, or apparrells change, Their soules, though long acquainted they had beene, These clothes, their bodies, never yet had seene. Therefore at first shee modestly might start, But must forthwith surrender every part, As freely, as each to each before, gave either eye or heart. XI. The good-night. Now, as in Tullias tombe, one lampe burnt cleare, Unchang'd for fifteene hundred yeare, May these love-lamps we here enshrine, In warmth, light, lasting, equall the divine; Fire ever doth aspire, And makes all like it selfe, turnes all to fire, But ends in ashes, which these cannot doe, For none of these is fuell, but fire too. This is joyes bonfire, then, where loves strong Arts Make of so noble individuall parts One fire of foure inflaming eyes, and of two loving hearts. Idios. As I have brought this song, that I may doe A perfect sacrifice, I'll burne it too. Allophanes. No S?. This paper I have justly got, For, in burnt incense, the perfume is not His only that presents it, but of all, What ever celebrates this Festivall Is common, since the joy thereof is so. Nor may your selfe be Priest: But let me goe, Backe to the Court, and I will lay'it upon Such Altars, as prize your devotion. Epithalamion made at Lincolnes Inne. The Sun-beames in the East are spred, Leave, leave, faire Bride, your solitary bed, No more shall you returne to it alone, It nourseth sadnesse, and your bodies print, Like to a grave, the yielding downe doth dint; You and your other you meet there anon; Put forth, put forth that warme balme-breathing thigh, Which wh? next time you in these sheets wil smother There it must meet another, Which never was, but must be, oft, more nigh; Come glad from thence, goe gladder then you came, To day put on perfection, and a womans name. Daughters of London, you which bee Our Golden Mines, and furnish'd Treasurie, You which are Angels, yet still bring with you Thousands of Angels on your mariage daies, Help with your presence, and devise to praise These rites, which also unto you grow due; Conceitedly dresse her, and be assign'd, By you, fit place for every flower and jewell, Make her for love fit fewell As gay as Flora, and as rich as Inde; So may shee faire and rich, in nothing lame, To day put on perfection, and a womans name. And you frolique Patricians Some of these Senators wealths deep oceans, Ye painted courtiers, barrels of others wits, Yee country men, who but your beasts love none, Yee of those fellowships whereof hee's one, Of study and play made strange Hermaphrodits, Here shine; This Bridegroom to the Temple bring Loe, in yon path which store of straw'd flowers graceth, The sober virgin paceth; Except my sight faile, 'tis no other thing; Weep not nor blush, here is no griefe nor shame, To day put on perfection, and a womans name. Thy two-leav'd gates faire Temple unfold, And these two in thy sacred bosome hold, Till, mystically joyn'd, but one they bee; Then may thy leane and hunger-starved wombe Long time expect their bodies and their tombe, Long after their owne parents fatten thee; All elder claimes, and all cold barrennesse, All yeelding to new loves bee far for ever, Which might these two dissever, Alwaies, all th'other may each one possesse; For, the best Bride, best worthy of praise and fame, To day puts on perfection, and a womans name. Winter dayes bring much delight, Not for themselves, but for they soon bring night; Other sweets wait thee then these diverse meats, Other disports then dancing jollities, Other love tricks then glancing with the eyes; But that the Sun still in our halfe Spheare sweates; Hee flies in winter, but he now stands still, Yet shadowes turne; No one point he hath attain'd, His steeds will bee restrain'd, But gallop lively downe the Westerne hill; Thou shalt, when he hath come the worlds half frame, To night but on perfection, and a womans name. The amorous evening starre is rose, Why then should not our amorous starre inclose Her selfe in her wish'd bed? Release your strings Musicians, and dancers take some truce With these your pleasing labours, for great use As much wearinesse as perfection brings; You, and not only you, but all toyl'd beasts Rest duly; at night all their toyles are dispensed; But in their beds commenced Are other labours, and more dainty feasts; She goes a maid, who, least she turne the same, To night puts on perfection, and a womans name. Thy virgins girdle now untie, And in thy nuptiall bed [loves alter] lye A pleasing sacrifice; now dispossesse Thee of these chaines and robes which were put on T'adorne the day, not thee; for thou, alone, Like vertue'and truth, art best in nakednesse; This bed is onely to virginitie A grave, but, to a better state, a cradle; Till now thou wast but able To be what now thou art; then that by thee No more be said, I may bee, but, I am, To night put on perfection, and a womans name. Even like a faithfull man content, That this life for a better should be spent; So, shee a mothers rich stile doth preferre, And at the Bridegroomes wish'd approach doth lye, Like an appointed lambe, when tenderly The priest comes on his knees t'embowell her; Now sleep or watch with more joy; and O light Of heaven, to morrow rise thou hot, and early; This Sun will love so dearely Her rest, that long, long we shall want her sight; Wonders are wrought, for shee which had no maime, To night puts on perfection, and a womans name. Obsequies to the Lord Harringtons brother. To the Countesse of Bedford. Faire soule, which wast, not onely, as all soules bee, Then when thou wast infused, harmony, But did'st continue so; and now dost beare A part in Gods great organ, this whole Spheare: If looking up to God; or downe to us, Thou finde that any way is pervious, Twixt heav'n and earth, and that mans actions doe Come to your knowledge, and affections too, See, and with joy, mee to that good degree Of goodnesse growne, that I can studie thee, And, by these meditations refin'd, Can unapparell and enlarge my minde, And so can make by this soft extasie, This place a map of heav'n, my selfe of thee. Thou seest mee here at midnight, now all rest; Times dead-low water; when all mindes devest To morrows businesse, when the labourers have Such rest in bed, that their last Church-yard grave, Subject to change, will scarce be'a type of this, Now when the clyent, whose last hearing is To morrow, sleeps, when the condemned man, (Who when hee opes his eyes, must shut them than Againe by death,) although sad watch hee keepe, Doth practice dying by a little sleepe, Thou at this midnight seest mee, and as soone As that Sunne rises to mee, midnight's noone, All the world growes transparent, and I see Through all, both Church and State, in seeing thee; And I discerne by favour of this light, My selfe, the hardest object of the sight. God is the glasse; as thou when thou dost see Him who sees all, seest all concerning thee, So, yet unglorified, I comprehend All, in these mirrors of thy wayes, and end; Though God be our true glass, through which we see All, since the beeing of all things is hee, Yet are the trunkes which doe to us derive Things, in proportion fit by perspective, Deeds of good men, for by their living here, Vertues, indeed remote, seeme to be nere; But where can I affirme, or where arrest My thoughts on his deeds? which shall I call best? For fluid vertue cannot be look'd on, Nor can endure a contemplation; As bodies change, and as I do not weare Those Spirits, humors, blood I did last yeare, And, as if on a streame I fixe mine eye, That drop, which I looked on, is presently Pusht with more waters from my sight, and gone, So in this sea of vertues, can no one Bee'insisted on, vertues, as rivers, passe, Yet still remaines that vertuous man there was; And as if man feeds on mans flesh, and so Part of his body to another owe, Yet at the last two perfect bodies rise, Because God knowes where every Atome lyes; So, if one knowledge were made of all those, Who knew his minutes well, hee might dispose His vertues into names, and ranks; but I Should injure Nature, Vertue, and Destinie, Should I divide and discontinue so, Vertue, which did in one intirenesse grow. For as, hee that would say, spirits are fram'd Of all the purest parts that can be nam'd, Honours not spirits halfe so much, as hee Which sayes, they have no parts, but simple bee; So is't of vertue; for a point and one Are much entirer then a million. And had Fate meant to have his vertues told, It would have let him live to have beene old, So then, that vertue in season, and then this, We might have seene, and said, that now he is Witty, now wise, now temperate, now just: In good short lives, vertues are faine to thrust, And to be sure betimes to get a place, When they would exercise, lacke time, and space. So was it in this person, forc'd to bee For lack of time, his owne epitome. So to exhibit in few yeares as much, As all the long breath'd Chronicles can touch; As when an Angell down from heav'n doth flye, Our quick thought cannot keepe him company, Wee cannot thinke, now hee is at the Sunne, Now through the Moon, now he through th'aire doth run, Yet when he's come, we know he did repaire To all twixt Heav'n and Earth, Sunne, Moon, and Aire. And as this Angell in an instant, knowes, And yet wee know, this sodaine knowledge growes By quick amassing severall formes of things, Which he successively to order brings; When they, whose slow pac'd lame thoughts cannot goe So fast as hee, thinke that he doth not so; Just as a perfect reader doth not dwell, On every syllable, nor stay to spell, Yet without doubt, hee doth distinctly see And lay together every A, and B; So, in short liv'd good men, is'not understood Each severall vertue, but the compound good. For, they all vertues paths in that pace tread, As Angells goe, and know, and as men read. O why should then these men, these lumps of Balme Sent hither, the worlds tempest to becalme, Before by deeds they are diffus'd and spred, And so make us alive, themselves be dead? O Soule, O circle, why so quickly bee Thy ends, thy birth and death clos'd up in thee? Since one foot of thy compasse still was plac'd In heav'n, the other might securely'have pac'd In the most large extent, through every path, Which the whole world, or man, the abridgment hath. Thou knowst, that though the tropique circles have (Yea and those small ones which the Poles engrave,) All the same roundnesse, evennesse, and all The endlesnesse of the equinoctiall; Yet, when we come to measure distances, How here, how there, the Sunne affected is, When he doth faintly worke, and when prevaile, Onely great circles, then, can be our scale: So, though thy circle to thy selfe expresse All, tending to thy endlesse happinesse, And wee, by our good use of it may trye, Both how to live well young, and how to die, Yet, since we must be old, and age endures His Torrid Zone at Court, and calentures Of hot ambitions, irrelegions ice, Zeales agues; and hydroptique avarice, Infirmities which need the scale of truth, As well, as lust and ignorance of youth; Why did'st thou not for these give medicines too, And by thy doing tell us what to doe? Though as small pocket-clocks, whose every wheele Doth each mismotion and distemper feele, Whose hands get shaking palsies, and whose string (His sinewes) slackens, and whose Soule, the spring, Expires, or languishes, whose pulse, the flye, Either beates not, or beates unevenly, Whose voice, the Bell, doth rattle, or grow dumbe, Or idle, 'as men, which to their last houres come, If these clockes be not wound, or be wound still, Or be not set, or set at every will; So, youth is easiest to destruction, If then wee follow all, or follow none; Yet, as in great clocks, which in steeples chime, Plac'd to informe whole towns, to'imploy their time, An error doth more harme, being generall, When, small clocks faults, only'on the wearer fall. So worke the faults of age, on which the eye Of children, servants, or the State relie. Why wouldst not thou then, which hadst such a soule, A clock so true, as might the Sunne controule, And daily hadst from him, who gave it thee, Instructions, such as it could never be Disordered, stay here, as a generall And great Sun-dyall, to have set us All? O why wouldst thou be any instrument To this unnaturall course, or why consent To this, not miracle, but Prodigie, That when the ebbs, longer then flowings be, Vertue, whose flood did with thy youth begin, Should so much faster ebb out, then flow in? Though her flood was blowne in, by thy first breath, All is at once sunke in the whirle-poole death. Which word I would not name, but that I see Death, else a desert, growne a Court by thee. Now I grow sure, that if a man would have Good companie, his entry is a grave. Mee thinkes all Cities, now, but Anthills bee, Where, when the severall labourers I see, For children, house, Provision, taking paine, They'are all but Ants, carrying eggs, straw, and grain; And Church-yards are our cities, unto which The most repaire, that are in goodnesse rich. There is the best concourse, and confluence, There are the holy suburbs, and from thence Begins Gods City, New Jerusalem, Which doth extend her utmost gates to them; At that gate then Triumphant soule, dost thou Begin thy Triumph; But since lawes allow That at the Triumph day, the people may, All that they will, 'gainst the Triumpher say, Let me here use that freedome, and expresse My griefe, though not to make thy Triumph lesse. By law, to Triumphs none admitted bee, Till they as Magistrates get victorie, Though then to thy force, all youthes foes did yield, Yet till fit time had brought thee to that field, To which thy ranke in this state destin'd thee, That there thy counsailes might get victorie, And so in that capacitie remove, All jealousies, 'twixt Prince and subjects love, Thou could'st no title, to this triumph have, Thou didst intrude on death, usurp'st a grave. That (though victoriously) thou hadst fought as yet But with thine owne affections, with the heate Of youths desires, and colds of ignorance, But till thou should'it successefully advance Thine armes 'gainst forraine enemies, which are Both Envy, and acclamation popular, (For, both these engines equally defeate, Though by a divers Mine, those which are great,) Till then thy War was but a civill War, For which to Triumph, none admitted are; No more are they, who though with good successe, In a defensive war, their power expresse, Before men triumph, the dominion Must be enlarg'd, and not preserv'd alone; Why should'st thou then, whose battailes were to win Thy selfe, from those straits nature put thee in, And to deliver up to God that state, Of which he gave thee the vicariate. (Which is thy soule and body) as intire As he, who takes endeavours, doth require, But didst not stay, t'enlarge his kingdome too, By making others; what thou didst, to doe; Why shouldst thou Triumph now, when Heav'n no more Hath got, by getting thee, then t'had before? For, Heav'n and thou, even when thou livedst here, Of one another in possession were; But this from Triumph most disables thee, That, that place which is conquered, must bee Left safe from present warre, and likely doubt Of imminent commotions to breake out. And hath he left us so? or can it bee His territory was no more then Hee? No, we were all his charge, the Diocis Of ev'ry exemplar man, the whole world is, And he was joyned in commission With Tutelar Angels, sent to every one. But though this freedome to upbraid, and chide Him who Triumph'd, were lawfull, it was ty'd With this, that it might never reference have Unto the Senate, who this triumph gave; Men might at Pompey jeast, but they might not At that authoritie, by which he got Leave to Triumph, before, by age, he might; So, though triumphant soule, I dare to write, Mov'd with a reverentiall anger, thus, That thou so earely wouldst abandon us; Yet I am farre from daring to dispute With that great soveraigntie, whose absolute Prerogative hath thus dispens'd with thee, 'Gainst natures lawes, which just impugners bee Of early triumphs; And I (though with paine) Lessen our losse, to magnifie thy gaine Of triumph, when I say, It was more fit, That all men should lacke thee, then thou lack it. Though then in our time, be not suffered That testimonie of love, unto the dead, To die with them, and in their graves be hid, As Saxon wives, and French soldarii did; And though in no degree I can expresse, Griefe in great Alexanders great excesse, Who at his friends death, made whole townes devest Their walls and bullwarks which became them best: Doe not, faire soule, this sacrifice refuse, That in thy grave I doe interre my Muse, Who, by my griefe, great as thy worth, being cast Behind hand, yet hath spoke, and spoke her last. Elegie. [The Comparison.] As the sweet sweat of Roses in a Still, As that which fr? chaf'd muskats pores doth trill, As the Almighty Balme of th'early East, Such are the sweat drops of my Mistris breast. And on her necke her skin such lustre sets, They seeme no sweat drops, but pearle coronets. Ranke sweaty froth thy Mistresse's brow defiles, Like spermatique issue of ripe menstruous boiles. Or like the skumme, which, by needs lawlesse law Enforc'd, Sanserra's starved men did draw From parboild shooes, and bootes, and all the rest Which were with any soveraigne fatnes blest, And like vile stones lying in saffrond tinne, Or warts, or wheales, it hangs upon her skinne. Round as the world's her head, on every side, Like to the fatall Ball which fell on Ide, Or that whereof God had such jealousie, As, for the ravishing thereof we die. Thy head is like a rough-hewne statue of jeat, Where marks for eyes, nose, mouth, are yet scarce set; Like the first Chaos, or flat seeming face Of Cynthia, when th'earths shadowes her embrace. Like Proserpines white beauty-keeping chest, Or Joues best fortunes urne, is her faire brest. Thine's like worme eaten trunkes, cloth'd in seals skin, Or grave, that's dust without, and stinke within. And like that slender stalke, at whose end stands The wood-bine quivering, are her armes and hands, Like rough bark'd elmboughes, or the russet skin Of men late scurg'd for madnes, or for sinne, Like Sun-parch'd quarters on the citie gate, Such is thy tann'd skins lamentable state. And like a bunch of ragged carrets stand The short swolne fingers of her gouty hand; Then like the Chymicks masculine equall fire, Which in the Lymbecks warme wombe doth inspire Into th'earths worthlesse part a soule of gold, Such cherishing heat her best lov'd part doth hold. Thine's like the dread mouth of a fired gunne, Or like hot liquid metalls newly runne Into clay moulds, or like to that Ætna Where round about the grasse is burnt away. Are not your kisses then as filthy, and more, As a worme sucking an invenom'd sore? Doth not thy fearefull hand in feeling quake, As one which gath'ring flowers, still feares a snake? Is not your last act harsh, and violent, As where a Plough a stony ground doth rent? So kisse good Turtles, so devoutly nice Are Priests in handling reverent sacrifice, And nice in searching wounds the Surgeon is As wee, when wee embrace, or touch, or kisse. Leave her, and I will leave comparing thus, She, and comparisons are odious. The Autumnall. Elegie. No Spring, nor Summer Beauty hath such grace, As I have seen in one Autumnall face, Yong Beauties force our love, and that's a Rape, This doth but counsaile, yet you cannot scape. If t'were a shame to love, here t'were no shame, Affections here take Reverences name. Were her first yeares the Golden Age; That's true, But now they'are gold oft tried, and ever new. That was her torrid and inflaming time, This is her tolerable Tropique clyme. Faire eyes, who askes more heate, then comes from hence, He in a fever wishes pestilence. Call not these wrinkles, graves; If graves they were, They were Loves graves; for else he is no where. Yet lies not love dead here, but here doth sit Vow'd to this trench, like an Anachorit. And here, till hers, which must be his death, come, He doth not digge a Grave, but build a Tombe. Here dwells he, though he sojourne ev'ry where; In Progresse, yet his standing house is here. Here, where still Evening is; not noone, nor night; Where no voluptuousnesse,, yet all delight. In all her words, unto all hearers fit, You may at Revels, you at counsaile, sit. This is loves timber, youth his under-wood; There he, as wine in Iune, enrages blood, Which then comes seasonabliest, when our tast And appetite to other things, is past; Xerxes strange Lydian love, the Platane tree, Was lov'd for age, none being so large as shee, Or else because, being yong, nature did blesse Her youth with ages glory, Barrennesse. If we love things long sought, Age is a thing Which we are fifty yeares in compassing. If transitory things, which soone decay, Age must be lovelyest at the latest day. But name not Winter-faces, whose skin's slacke; Lanke, as an unthrifts purse; but a soules sacke; Whose Eyes seeke light within, for all here's shade; Whose mouthes are holes, rather worne out, then made Whose every tooth to a severall place is gone, To vexe their soules at Resurrection; Name not these living Deaths-heads unto mee, For these, not Ancient, but Antique be; I hate extreames; yet I had rather stay With Tombs, then Cradles, to weare out a day. Since such loves motion natural is, may still My love descend, and journey downe the hill, Not panting after growing beauties, so, I shall ebbe out with them, who home-ward goe. Elegie. [The Dream.] Image of her whom I love, more then she, Whose faire impression in my faithfull heart, Makes mee her Medall, and makes her love mee, As Kings do coynes, to which their stamps impart The value: goe, and take my heart from hence, Which now is growne too great and good for me: Honours oppresse weake spirits, and our sense, Strong objects dull, the more, the lesse wee see, When you are gone, and Reason gone with you, Then Fantasie is Queene and Soule, and all; She can present joyes meaner then you do; Convenient, and more proportionall. So, if I dreame I have you, I have you, For, all our joyes are but fantasticall. And so I scape the paine, for paine is true; And sleepe which locks up sense, doth lock out all After a such fruition I shall wake, And, but the waking, nothing shall repent; And shall to love more thankfull Sonnets make, Then if more honour, teares, and paines were spent. But dearest heart, and dearer image stay; Alas, true joyes at best are dreame enough; Though you stay here you passe too fast away: For even at first lifes Taper is a snuffe. Fill'd with her love, may I be rather grown Mad with much heart, then ideott with none. Elegie on Prince Henry. Looke to mee faith, and looke to my faith, God, For both my centers feele this period. Of waight one center, one of greatnesse is; And Reason is that center, Faith is this; For into'our reason flow, and there do end All, that this naturall world doth comprehend: Quotidian things, and equidistant hence, Shut in, for man, in one circumference. But for th'enormous greatnesses, which are So disproportion'd, and so angulare, As is Gods essence, place and providence, Where, how, when, what soules do, departed hence, These things (eccentrique else) on faith do strike; Yet neither all, nor upon all, alike. For reason, put to'her best extension, Almost meetes faith, and makes both centers one, And nothing ever came so nere to this, As contemplation of that Prince, wee misse. For all that faith might credit mankinde could, Reason still seconded, that this prince would. If then least moving of the center, make More, then if whole hell belch'd, the world to shake. What must this do, centers distracted so, That wee see not what to beleeve or know? Was it not well beleev'd till now, that hee, Whose reputation was an extasie, On neighbour States, which knew not why to wake, Till hee discover'd what wayes he would take; For whom, what Princes angled, when they tryed, Met a Torpedo, and were stupified; And others studies, how he would be bent, Was his great fathers greatest instrument, And activ'st spirit, to convey and tie This soule of peace, through Christianity; Was it not well beleev'd, that hee would make This generall peace, th'Eternall overtake, And that his times might have stretch'd out so farre, As to touch those, of which they emblems are? For to confirme this just beleefe, that now The last dayes came, wee saw heav'n did allow, That, but from his aspect and exercise, In peacefull times, Rumors of war did rise. But now this faith is heresie: we must Still stay, and vexe our great grand mother, Dust. Oh, is God prodigall? hath he spent his store Of plagues, on us, and onely now, when more Would ease us much, doth he grudge misery; And will not let's enjoy our curse; to dy. As, for the earth throwne lowest downe of all, T'were an ambition to desire to fall, So God, in our desire to dye, doth know Our plot for ease, in being wretched so. Therefore we live; though such a life wee have, As but so many mandrakes on his grave. What had his growth, and generation done, When, what we are, his putrefaction Sustaines in us; Earth, which griefes animate; Nor hath our world now, other Soule then that. And could griefe get so high as heav'n, that Quire, Forgetting this their new joy, would desire (With griefe to see him) hee had staid below, To rectifie our errours, They foreknow. Is th'other center, Reason, faster then? Where should we looke for that, now we'are not men? For if our Reason be'our connexion Of causes, now to us there can be none. For, as if all the substances were spent, 'Twere madnesse, to enquire of accident, So is't to looke for reason, hee being gone, The onely subject reason wrought upon. If Fate have such a chaine, whose divers links Industrious man discerneth, as hee thinks, When miracle doth come, and so steale in A new linke, man knowes not, where to begin At a much deader fault must reason bee, Death having broke off such a linke as hee. But now, for us, with busie proofe to come, That we'have no reason, would prove wee had some; So would just lamentations: Therefore wee May safelyer say, that we are dead, then hee. So, if our griefs wee do not well declare, We'have double excuse; he'is not dead; and we are. Yet I would not dy yet; for though I bee Too narrow, to thinke him, as hee is hee, (Our Soules best baiting, and midd-period, In her long journey, of considering God) Yet, (no dishonour) I can reach him thus, As he embrac'd the fires of love, with us. Oh may I, (since I live) but see, or heare, That she-Intelligence which mov'd this spheare, I pardon Fate, my life: who ere thou bee, Which hast the noble conscience, thou art shee, I conjure thee by all the charmes he spoke, By th'oathes, which onely you two never broke, By all the soules yee sigh'd, that if you see These lines, you wish, I knew your history. So much, as you, two mutuall heav'ns were here, I were an Angell, singing what you were. Psalme 137.The attribution of this poem is questionable. I By Euphrates flowry side We did bide, From deare Juda farre absented, Tearing the aire with our cryes, And our eyes, With their streames his streame augmented. II When, poore Syons dolefull state, Desolate; Sacked, burned, and inthrall'd, And the Temple spoil'd, which wee Ne'r should see, To our mirthlesse mindes wee call'd: III Our mute harpes, untun'd, unstrung, Up wee hung On greene willowes neere beside us, Where, we sitting all forlorne; Thus, in scorne, Our proud spoylers 'gan deride us. IV Come, sad Captives, leave your moanes, And your groanes Under Syons ruines bury; Tune your harps, and sing us layes In the praise Of your God, and let's be merry, V Can, ah, can we leave our moanes? And our groanes Under Syons ruines bury? Can we in this Land sing Layes In the praise Of our God, and here be merry? VI No; deare Syon, if I yet Do forget Thine affliction miserable, Let my nimble joynts become Stiffe and numme, To touch warbling harpe unable. VII Let my tongue lose singing skill, Let it still To my parched roofe be glewed, If in either harpe or voice I rejoyce, Till thy joyes shall be renewed VIII Lord, curse Edom's traiterous kinde, Beare in minde In our ruines how they revell'd, Sack, kill, burne, they cry'd out still, Sack, burne, kill, Downe with all, let all be levell'd. IX And, thou Babel, when the tide Of thy pride Now a flowing, growes to turning; Victor now, shall then be thrall, And shall fall To as low an ebbe of mourning. X Happy he who shall thee waste, As thou hast Us, without all mercy, wasted, And shall make thee taste and see What poore wee By thy meanes have seene and tasted. XI Happy, who, thy tender barnes From the armes Of their wailing mothers tearing, 'Gainst the walls shall dash their bones, Ruthlesse stones With their braines and blood besmearing. Resurrection, imperfect. Sleep sleep old Sun, thou canst not have repast As yet, the wound thou took'st on friday last; Sleepe then, and rest; The world may beare thy stay, A better Sun rose before thee to day, Who, not content to'enlighten all that dwell On the earths face, as thou, enlightned hell, And made the darke fires languish in that vale, As, at thy presence here, our fires grow pale. Whose body having walk'd on earth, and now Hasting to Heaven, would, that he might allow Himselfe unto all stations, and fill all, For these three daies become a minerall; Hee was all gold when he lay downe, but rose All tincture, and doth not alone dispose Leaden and iron wills to good, but is Of power to make even sinfull flesh like his. Had one of those, whose credulous pietie Thought, that a Soule one might discerne and see Goe from a body, 'at this sepulcher been, And, issuing from the sheet, this body seen, He would have justly thought this body a soule, If, not of any man, yet of the whole. Desunt cætera. An hymne to the Saints, and to Marquesse Hamylton. Whither that soule which now comes up to you Fill any former ranke or make a new, Whither it take a name nam'd there before, Or be a name it selfe, and order more Then was in heaven till now; (for may not hee Bee so? if every severall Angell bee A kind alone;) What ever order grow Greater by him in heaven, wee doe not so; One of your orders growes by his accesse; But, by his losse grow all our orders lesse; The name of Father, Master, Friend, the name Of Subject and of Prince, in one are lame; Faire mirth is dampt, and conversation black, The household widdow'd, and the garter slack; The Chappell wants an eare, Councell a tongue; Story, a theame; and Musicke lacks a song; Blest order that hath him, the losse of him Gangred all Orders here; all lost a limbe. Never made body such hast to confesse What a soule was; All former comelinesse Fled, in a minute, when the soule was gone, And, having lost that beauty, would have none, So fell our Monasteries, in one instant growne Not to lesse houses, but, to heapes of stone; So sent this body that faire forme it wore, Unto the spheare of formes, and doth (before His soule shall fill up his sepulchrall stone,) Anticipate a Resurrection; For, as in his fame, now, his soule is here, So, in the forme thereof his bodie's there; And if, faire soule, not with first Innocents Thy station be, but with the Pænitents, (And, who shall dare to aske then when I am Dy'd scarlet in the blood of that pure Lambe, Whether that colour, which is scarlet then, Were black or white before in eyes of men?) When thou rememb'rest what sins thou didst finde Amongst those many friends now left behinde, And seest such sinners as they are, with thee Got thither by repentance, Let it bee Thy wish to wish all there, to wish them cleane; Wish him a David, her a Magdalen. An Epitaph upon Shakespeare.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Chaucer lie a thought more nigh To rare Beaumond; and learned Beaumond lie A little nearer Spencer, to make roome For Shakespeare in your threefold fourefold tombe, To lie all foure in one bed make a shift, For, untill doomesday hardly will a fift Betwixt this day and that be slaine, For whom your curtaines need be drawne againe; But, if precedency of death doth barre A fourth place in your sacred sepulchre, Under this curled marble of thine owne Sleepe rare Tragedian Shakespeare, sleepe alone, That, unto Vs and others it may bee Honor, hereafter to be laid by thee. Sapho to Philænis. Where is that holy fire, which Verse is said To have, is that inchanting force decai'd? Verse that drawes Natures workes, from Natures law, Thee, her best worke, to her worke cannot draw. Have my teares quench'd my old Poetique fire; Why quench'd they not as well, that of desire? Thoughts, my mindes creatures, often are with thee, But I, their maker; want their libertie. Onely thine image, in my heart, doth sit, But that is waxe, and fires environ it. My fires have driven, thine have drawne it hence; And I am rob'd of Picture, Heart, and Sense. Dwells with me still mine irksome Memory, Which, both to keepe, and lose, grieves equally. That tells me'how faire thou art: Thou art so faire, As, gods, when gods to thee I doe compare, Are grac'd thereby; And to make blinde men see, What things gods are, I say they'are like to thee. For, if we justly call each silly man A litle world, What shall we call thee than? Thou art not soft, and cleare, and strait, and faire, As Down, as Stars, Cedars, and Lillies are, But thy right hand, and cheek, and eye, only Are like thy other hand, and cheek, and eye. Such was my Phao awhile, but shall be never, As thou, wast, art, and, oh, maist be ever. Here lovers sweare in their Idolatrie, That I am such; but Griefe discolors me. And yet I grieve the lesse, least Griefe remove My beauty, and make me'unworthy of thy love. Plaies some soft boy with thee, oh there wants yet A mutuall feeling which should sweeten it. His chinne, a thorny hairy unevennesse Doth threaten, and some daily change possesse. Thy body is a naturall Paradise, In whose selfe, unmanur'd, all pleasure lies, Nor needs perfection; why shouldst thou than Admit the tillage of a harsh rough man? Men leave behinde them that which their sin showes, And are, as theeves trac'd, which rob when it snows. But of our dallyance no more signes there are, Then fishes leave in streames, or Birds in aire. And betweene us all sweetnesse may be had; All, all that Nature yields, or Art can adde. My two lips, eyes, thighs, differ from thy two, But so, as thine from one another doe; And, oh, no more; the likenesse being such, Why should they not alike in all parts touch? Hand to strange hand, lippe to lippe none denies; Why should they brest to brest, or thighs to thighs? Likenesse begets such strange selfe flatterie, That touching my selfe, all seemes done to thee. My selfe I embrace, and mine owne hands I kisse, And amorously thanke my selfe for this. Me, in my glasse, I call thee; But alas, When I would kisse, teares dimme mine eyes, and glasse. O cure this loving madnesse, and restore Me to mee; shee, my halfe, my all, my more, So may thy cheekes red outweare scarlet dye, And their white, whitenesse of the Galaxy, So may thy mighty amazing beauty move Envy' in all women, and in all men, love, And so be change, and sicknesse, farre from thee, As thou by comming neere, keep'st them from me. The Annuntiation and Passion. Tamely fraile body'abstaine to day; to day My soule eates twice, Christ hither and away. She sees him man, so like God made in this, That of them both a circle embleme is, Whose first and last concurre; this doubtfull day Of feast or fast, Christ came, and went away; Shee sees him nothing twice at once, who'is all; Shee sees a Cedar plant it selfe, and fall, Her Maker put to making, and the head Of life, at once, not yet alive, yet dead; She sees at once the virgin mother stay Reclus'd at home, Publique at Golgotha. Sad and rejoyc'd shee's seen at once, and seen At almost fiftie, and at scarce fifteene. At once a Sonne is promis'd her, and gone, Gabriell gives Christ to her, He her to John; Not fully a mother, Shee's in Orbitie, At once receiver and the legacie; All this, and all betweene, this day hath showne, Th'Abridgement of Christs story, which makes one (As in plaine Maps, the furthest West is East) Of the'Angels Ave, 'and Consummatum est. How well the Church, Gods Court of faculties Deales, in some times, and seldome joyning these; As by the selfe-fix'd Pole wee never doe Direct our course, but the next starre thereto, Which showes where the'other is, and which we say (Because it strayes not farre) doth never stray; So God by his Church, neerest to him, wee know, And stand firme, if wee by her motion goe; His Spirit, as his fiery Pillar doth Leade, and his Church, as cloud; to one end both: This Church, by letting those daies joyne, hath shown Death and conception in mankinde is one. Or 'twas in him the same humility, That he would be a man, and leave to be: Or as creation he hath made, as God, With the last judgement, but one period, His imitating Spouse would joyne in one Manhoods extremes: He shall come, he is gone: Or as though one blood drop, which thence did fall, Accepted, would have serv'd, he yet shed all; So though the least of his paines, deeds, or words, Would busie a life, she all this day affords; This treasure then, in grosse, my Soule uplay, And in my life retaile it every day. Goodfriday, 1613. Riding Westward. Let mans Soule be a Spheare, and then, in this, The intelligence that moves, devotion is, And as the other Spheares, by being growne Subject to forraigne motion, lose their owne, And being by others hurried every day, Scarce in a yeare their naturall forme obey: Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit For their first mover, and are whirld by it. Hence is't, that I am carryed towards the West This day, wh? my Soules forme bends toward the East. There I should see a Sunne, by rising set, And by that setting endlesse day beget; But that Christ on this Crosse, did rise and fall, Sinne had eternally benighted all. Yet dare I'almost be glad, I do not see That spectacle of too much weight for mee. Who sees Gods face, that is selfe life, must dye; What a death were it then to see God dye? It made his owne Lieutenant Nature shrinke, It made his footstoole crack, and the Sunne winke. Could I behold those hands which span the Poles, And tune all spheares at once peirc'd with those holes? Could I behold that endlesse height which is Zenith to us, and our Antipodes, Humbled below us? or that blood which is The seat of all our Soules, if not of his, Made durt of dust, or that flesh which was worne By God, for his apparell, rag'd, and torne? If on these things I durst not looke, durst I Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye, Who was Gods partner here, and furnish'd thus Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us? Though these things, as I ride, be from mine eye, They'are present yet unto my memory, For that looks towards them; &amp; thou look'st towards mee, O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree; I turne my backe to thee, but to receive Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave. O thinke mee worth thine anger, punish mee, Burne off my rusts, and my deformity, Restore thine Image, so much, by thy grace, That thou may'st know mee, and I'll turne my face. THE LITANIE. The Father. Father of Heaven, and him, by whom It, and us for it, and all else, for us Thou madest, and govern'st ever, come And re-create mee, now growne ruinous: My heart is by dejection, clay, And by selfe-murder, red. From this red earth, O Father, purge away All vicious tinctures, that new fashioned I may rise up from death, before I'am dead. The Sonne. O Sonne of God, who seeing two things, Sinne, and death crept in, which were never made, By bearing one, tryed'st with what stings The other could thine heritage invade; O be thou nail'd unto my heart, And crucified againe, Part not from it, though it from thee would part, But let it be by applying so thy paine, Drown'd in thy blood, and in thy passion slaine. The Holy Ghost. O Holy Ghost, whose temple I Am, but of mudde walls, and condensed dust, And being sacrilegiously Halfe wasted with youths fires, of pride and lust, Must with new stormes be weatherbeat; Double in my heart thy flame, Which let devout sad teares intend; and let (Though this glasse lanthorne, flesh, do suffer maime) Fire, Sacrifice, Priest, Altar be the same. The Trinity. O Blessed glorious Trinity, Bones to Philosophy, but milke to faith, Which, as wife serpents diversly Most slipperinesse, yet most entanglings hath, As you distinguish'd undistinct By power, love, knowledge bee, Give mee a such selfe different instinct Of these let all mee elemented bee, Of power, to love, to know, you unnumbred three. The Virgin Mary. For that faire blessed Mother-maid, Whose flesh redeem'd us; That she-Cherubin, Which unlock'd Paradise, and made One claime for innocence, and disseiz'd sinne, Whose wombe was a strange heav'n, for there God cloath'd himselfe, and grew, Our zealous thankes wee poure. As her deeds were Our helpes, so are her prayers; nor can she sue In vaine, who hath such titles unto you. The Angels. And since this life our nonage is, And wee in Wardship to thine Angels be, Native in heavens faire Palaces Where we shall be but denizen'd by thee, As th'earth conceiving by the Sunne, Yeelds faire diversitie, Yet never knowes which course that light doth run, So let mee study, that mine actions bee Worthy their sight, though blinde in how they see. The Patriarches. And let thy Patriarches Desire (Those great Grandfathers, of thy Church, which saw More in the cloud, then wee in fire, Whom Nature clear'd more, then us grace and law, And now in Heaven still pray, that wee May use our new helpes right,) Be sanctified, and fructifie in mee; Let not my minde be blinder by more light Nor Faith by Reason added, lose her sight. The Prophets. Thy Eagle-sighted Prophets too, Which were thy Churches Organs, and did sound That harmony, which made of two One law, and did unite, but not confound; Those heavenly Poëts which did see Thy will, and it expresse In rythmique feet, in common pray for mee, That I by them excuse not my excesse In seeking secrets, or Poëtiquenesse. The Apostles. And thy illustrious Zodiacke Of twelve Apostles, which ingirt this All, From whom whosoever do not take Their light, to darke deep pits, throw downe, and fall, As through their prayers, thou'hast let mee know That their bookes are divine; May they pray still, and be heard, that I goe Th'old broad way in applying; O decline Mee, when my comment would make thy word mine. The Martyrs. And since thou so desirously Did'st long to die, that long before thou could'st, And long since thou no more couldst dye, Thou in thy scatter'd mystique body wouldst In Abel dye, and ever since In thine, let their blood come To begge for us, a discreet patience Of death, or of worse life: for Oh, to some Not to be Martyrs, is a martyrdome. The Confessors. Therefore with thee triumpheth there A Virgin Squadron of white Confessors, Whose bloods betroth'd, not marryed were; Tender'd, not taken by those Ravishers: They know, and pray, that wee may know, In every Christian Hourly tempestuous persecutions grow, Tentations martyr us alive; A man Is to himselfe a Dioclesian. The Virgins. The cold white snowie Nunnery, Which, as thy mother, their high Abbesse, sent Their bodies backe againe to thee, As thou hadst lent them, cleane and innocent, Though they have not obtain'd of thee, That or thy Church, or I, Should keep, as they, our first integrity; Divorce thou sinne in us, or bid it die, And call chast widowhead Virginitie. The Doctors. Thy sacred Academie above Of Doctors, whose paines have unclasp'd, and taught Both bookes of life to us (for love To know thy Scriptures tells us, we are wrought In thy other booke) pray for us there That what they have misdone Or mis-said, wee to that may not adhere, Their zeale may be our sinne. Lord let us runne Meane waies, and call them stars, but not the Sunne. XIV And whil'st this universall Quire, That Church in triumph, this in warfare here, Warm'd with one all-partaking fire Of love, that none be lost, which cost thee deare, Prayes ceaslesly, 'and thou hearken too (Since to be gratious Our taske is treble, to pray, beare, and doe) Heare this prayer Lord, O Lord deliver us Fr? trusting in those prayers, though powr'd out thus. XV From being anxious, or secure, Dead clods of sadnesse, or light squibs of mirth, From thinking, that great courts immure All, or no happinesse, or that this earth Is only for our prison fram'd, Or that thou art covetous To them whom thou lovest, or that they are maim'd From reaching this worlds sweet, who seek thee thus, With all their might, Good Lord deliver us. XVI From needing danger, to bee good, From owing thee yesterdaies teares to day, From trusting so much to thy blood, That in that hope, wee wound our soule away, From bribing thee with Almes, to excuse Some sinne more burdenous, From light affecting, in religion, newes, From thinking us all soule, neglecting thus Our mutuall duties, Lord deliver us. XVII From tempting Satan to tempt us, By our connivence, or slack companie, From measuring ill by vitious, Neglecting to choake sins spawne, Vanitie, From indiscreet humilitie, Which might be scandalous, And cast reproach on Christianitie, From being spies, or to spies pervious, From thirst, or scorne of flame, deliver us. XVIII Deliver us for thy descent Into the Virgin, whose wombe was a place Of midle kind, and thou being sent To'ungratious us, staid'st at her full of grace, And through thy poore birth, where first thou Glorifiedst Povertie, And yet soone after riches didst allow, By accepting Kings gifts in the Epiphanie, Deliver, and make us, to both waies free. XIX And though that bitter agonie, Which is still the agonie of pious wits, Disputing what distorted thee, And interrupted evennesse, with fits, And through thy free confession Though thereby they were then Made blind, so that thou might'st from th? have gone, Good Lord deliver us, and teach us when Wee may not, and we may blinde unjust men. XX Through thy submitting all, to blowes Thy face, thy clothes to spoile; thy fame to scorne, All waies, which rage, or Justice knowes, And by which thou could'st shew, that thou wast born, And through thy gallant humblenesse Which thou in death did'st shew, Dying before thy soule they could expresse, Deliver us from death, by dying so, To this world, ere this world doe bid us goe. XXI When senses, which thy souldiers are, Wee arme against thee, and they fight for sinne, When want, sent but to tame, doth warre And worke despaire a breach to enter in, When plenty, Gods image, and seale Makes us Idolatrous, And love it, not him, whom it should reveale, When wee are mov'd to seeme religious Only to vent wit, Lord deliver us. XXII In Churches, when the'infirmitie Of him which speakes, diminishes the Word, When Magistrates doe mis-apply To us, as we judge, lay or ghostly sword, When plague, which is thine Angell, raignes, Or wars, thy Champions, swaie, When Heresie, thy second deluge, gaines; In th'houre of death, the'Eve of last judgement day, Deliver us from the sinister way. XXIII Heare us, O heare us Lord; to thee A sinner is more musique, when he prayes, Then spheares, or Angels praises bee, In Panegyrique Allelujaes, Heare us, for till thou heare us, Lord We know not what to say. Thine eare to'our sighes, teares, thoughts gives voice and word. O Thou who Satan heard'st in Jobs sicke day, Heare thy selfe now, for thou in us dost pray. XXIV That wee may change to evennesse This intermitting aguish Pietie, That snatching cramps of wickednesse And Apoplexies of fast sin, may die; That musique of thy promises, Not threats in Thunder may Awaken us to our just offices, What in thy booke, thou dost, or creatures say, That we may heare, Lord heare us, when wee pray. XXV That our eares sicknesse wee may cure, And rectifie those Labyrinths aright, That wee by harkning, not procure Our praise, nor others dispraise so invite, That wee get not a slipperinesse, And senslesly decline, From hearing bold wits jeast at Kings excesse, To'admit the like of majestie divine, That we may locke our eares, Lord open thine. XXVI That living law, the Magistrate, Which to give us, and make us physicke, doth Our vices often aggravate, That Preachers taxing sinne, before her growth, That Satan, and invenom'd men Which well, if we starve, dine, When they doe most accuse us, may see then Us, to amendment, heare them; thee decline; That we may open our eares, Lord lock thine. XXVII That learning, thine Ambassador, From thine allegeance wee never tempt, That beauty, paradises flower For physicke made, from poyson be exempt, That wit, borne apt, high good to doe By dwelling lazily On Natures nothing, be not nothing too, That our affections kill us not, nor dye, Heare us, weake ecchoes, O thou eare, and cry. XXVIII Sonne of God heare us, and since thou By taking our blood, owest it us againe Gaine to thy selfe, or us allow; And let not both us and thy selfe be slaine; O lambe of God, which took'st our sinne Which could not stick to thee, O let it not returne to us againe, But Patient and Physition being free, As sinne is nothing, let it no where be. [[The Message.]] Send home my long strayd eyes to mee, Which (Oh) too long have dwelt on thee, Yet since there they have learn'd such ill, Such forc'd fashions, And false passions, That they be Made by thee Fit for no good sight, keep them still. Send home my harmlesse heart againe, Which no unworthy thought could staine, Which if it be taught by thine To make jestings Of protestings, And breake both Word and oath, Keepe it, for then 'tis none of mine. Yet send me back my heart and eyes, That I may know, and see thy lyes, And may laugh and joy, when thou Art in anguish And dost languish For some one That will none, Or prove as false as thou art now. A nocturnall upon S. Lucies day, Being the shortest day. Tis the yeares midnight, and it is the dayes, Lucies, who scarce seaven houres herself unmaskes, The Sunne is spent, and now his flasks Send forth light squibs, no constant rayes; The worlds whole sap is sunke: The generall balme th'hydroptique earth hath drunk, Whither, as to the beds-feet life is shrunke, Dead and enterr'd; yet all these seeme to laugh, Compar'd with mee, who am their Epitaph. Study me then, you who shall lovers bee At the next world, that is, at the next Spring: For I am every dead thing, In whom love wrought new Alchimie. For his art did expresse A quintessence even from nothingnesse, From dull privations, and leane emptinesse He ruin'd mee, and I am re-begot Of absence, darknesse, death; things which are not. All others, from all things, draw all that's good, Life, soule, forme, spirit, whence they beeing have, I, by loves limbecke, am the grave Of all, that's nothing. Oft a flood Have wee two wept, and so Drownd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow To be two Chaosses, when we did show Care to ought else; and often absences Withdrew our soules, and made us carcasses. But I am by her death, (which word wrongs her) Of the first nothing, the Elixer grown; Were I a man, that I were one, I needs must know, I should preferre, If I were any beast, Some ends, some means; Yea plants, yea stones detest, And love, all, all some properties invest, If I an ordinary nothing were, As shadow, a light, and body must be here. But I am None; nor will my Sunne renew. You lovers, for whose sake, the lesser Sunne At this time to the Goat is runne To fetch new lust, and give it you, Enjoy your summer all, Since shee enjoyes her long nights festivall, Let mee prepare towards her, and let mee call This houre her Vigill, and her eve, since this Both the yeares, and the dayes deep midnight is. Witchcraft by a picture. I fixe mine eye on thine, and there Pitty my picture burning in thine eye, My picture drown'd in a transparent teare, When I looke lower I espie, Hadst thou the wicked skill By pictures made and mard, to kill? How many wayes mightst thou performe thy will? But now I have drunke thy sweet salt teares, And though thou poure more I'll depart; My picture vanish'd, vanish feares, That I can be endamag'd by that art; Though thou retaine of mee One picture more, yet that will bee, Being in thine owne heart, from all malice free. [[The Bait.]] Come live with mee, and bee my love, And wee will some new pleasures prove Of golden sands, and christall brookes: With silken lines, and silver hookes. There will the river whispering runne Warm'd by thy eyes, more then the Sunne. And there the'inamor'd fish will stay, Begging themselves they may betray. When thou wilt swimme in that live bath, Each fish, which every channell hath, Will amorously to thee swimme, Gladder to catch thee, then thou him. If thou, to be so seene, beest loath, By Sunne, or Moone, thou darknest both, And if my selfe have leave to see, I need not their light, having thee. Let others freeze with angling reeds, And cut their legges, which shells and weeds, Or treacherously poore fish beset, With strangling snare, or windowie net: Let coarse bold hands, from slimy nest The bedded fish in banks out-wrest, Or curious traitors, sleavesicke flies Bewitch poore fishes wandring eyes. For thee, thou needst no such deceit, For thou thy selfe art thine owne bait, That fish, that is not catch'd thereby, Alas, is wiser farre then I. The Apparition. When by thy scorne, O murdresse, I am dead, And that thou thinkst thee free From all solicitation from mee, Then shall my ghost come to thy bed, And thee fain'd vestall in worse armes shall see; Then thy sicke taper will begin to winke, And he, whose thou art then, being tyr'd before, Will, if thou stirre, or pinch to wake him, thinke Thou call'st for more, And in false sleepe will from thee shrinke, And then poore Aspen wretch, neglected thou Bath'd in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lye A veryer ghost then I; What I will say, I will not tell thee now, Lest that preserve thee'; and since my love is spent, I had rather thou shouldst painfully repent, Then by my threatnings rest still innocent. The broken heart. He is starke mad, who ever sayes, That he hath beene in love an houre, Yet not that love so soon decayes, But that it can tenne in lesse space devour; Who will beleeve mee, if I sweare That I have had the plague a yeare? Who would not laugh at mee, if I should say, I saw a flaske of powder burne a day? Ah, what a trifle is a heart, If once into loves hands it come? All other griefes allow a part To other griefes, and aske themselves but some, They come to us, but us Love draws, Hee swallows us, and never chawes: By him, as by chain'd shot, whole rankes doe dye, He is the tyran Pike, our hearts the Frye. If 'twere not so, what did become Of my heart, when I first saw thee? I brought a heart into the roome, But from the roome, I carried none with mee; If it had gone to thee, I know Mine would have taught thine heart to show More pitty unto mee: but Love, alas At one first blow did shiver it as glasse. Yet nothing can to nothing fall, Nor any place be empty quite, Therefore I thinke my breath hath all Those peeces still, though they be not unite; And now as broken glasses show A hundred lesser faces, so My ragges of heart can like, wish, and adore, But after one such love, can love no more. A Valediction forbidding mourning. As virtuous men passe mildly away, And whisper to the soules, to goe, Whilst some of their sad friends doe say, The breath goes now, and some say, no. So let us melt, and make no noise, No teare-floods, nor sigh-tempests move, T'were prophanation of our joyes To tell the layetie our love. Moving of th'earth brings harmes and feares, Men reckon what it did and meant, But trepidation of the spheares, Though greater farre, is innocent. Dull sublunary lovers love (Whose soule is sense) cannot admit Absence, because it doth remove Those things which elemented it. But we by a love, so much refin'd, That our selves know not what it is, Inter-assured of the mind, Care lesse, eyes, lips, hands to misse. Our two soules therefore, which are one, Though I must goe, endure not yet A breach, but an expansion, Like gold to ayery thinnesse beate. If they be two, they are two so As stiffe twin compasses are two, Thy soule the fixt foot, makes no show To move, but doth, if the'other doe. And though it in the center sit, Yet when the other far doth rome, It leanes, and hearkens after it, And growes erect, as that comes home. Such wilt thou be to mee, who must Like th'other foot, obliquely runne. Thy firmnes makes my circle just, And makes me end, where I begunne. The good-morrow. I wonder by my troth, what thou, and I Did, till we lov'd, were we not wean'd till then? But suck'd on countrey pleasures, childishly? Or snorted we in the seaven sleepers den? T'was so; But this, all pleasures fancies bee. If ever any beauty I did see, Which I desir'd, and got, t'was but a dreame of thee. And now good morrow to our waking soules, Which watch not one another out of feare; For love, all love of other sights controules, And makes one little roome, an every where. Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, Let Maps to other, worlds on worlds have showne, Let us possesse one world, each hath one, and is one. My face in thine eye, thine in mine appeares, And true plaine hearts doe in the faces rest, Where can we finde two better hemispheares Without sharpe North, without declining West? What ever dyes, was not mixt equally; If our two loves be one, or, thou and I Love so alike, that none doe slacken, none can die. Song. [Goe, and catche a falling starre] Goe, and catche a falling starre, Get with child a mandrake roote, Tell me, where all past yeares are, Or who cleft the Divels foot, Teach me to heare Mermaides singing, Or to keep off envies stinging, And finde What winde Serves to advance an honest minde. If thou beest borne to strange sights, Things invisible to see, Ride ten thousand daies and nights, Till age snow white haires on thee, Thou, when thou retorn'st, wilt tell mee All strange wonders that befell thee, And sweare No where Lives a woman true, and faire. If thou findst one, let mee know, Such a Pilgrimage were sweet, Yet doe not, I would not goe, Though at next doore wee might meet, Though shee were true, when you met her, And last, till you write your letter, Yet shee Will bee False, ere I come, to two, or three. Womans constancy. Now thou hast lov'd me one whole day, To morrow when thou leav'st, what wilt thou say? Wilt thou then Antedate some new made vow? Or say that now We are not just those persons, which we were? Or, that oathes made in reverentiall feare Of Love, and his wrath, any may forsweare? Or, as true deaths, true maryages untie, So lovers contracts, images of those, Binde but till sleep, deaths image, them unloose? Or, your owne end to Justifie, For having purpos'd change, and falsehood; you Can have no way but falsehood to be true? Vaine lunatique, against these scapes I could Dispute, and conquer, if I would, Which I abstaine to doe, For by to morrow, I may thinke so too. [[The Undertaking.]] I have done one braver thing Then all the worthies did, And yet a braver thence doth spring, Which is, to keepe that hid. It were but madnes now t'impart The skill of specular stone, When he which can have learn'd the art, To cut it can finde none. So, if I now should utter this, Others (because no more Such stuffe to worke upon, there is,) Would love but as before. But he who lovelinesse within Hath found, all outward loathes, For he who colour loves, and skinne, Loves but their oldest clothes. If, as I have, you also doe Vertue' attir'd in woman see, And dare love that, and say so too, And forget the Hee and Shee; And if this love, though placed so, From prophane men you hide, Which will no faith on this bestow, Or, if they doe, deride: Then you have done a braver thing Then all the Worthies did. And a braver thence will spring Which is, to keepe that hid. The Sunne Rising. Busie old foole, unruly Sunne, Why dost thou thus, Through windowes, and through curtaines call on us? Must to thy motions lovers seasons run? Sawcy pedantique wretch, goe chide Late schoole boyes, and sowre prentices, Goe tell Court-huntsmen, that the King will ride, Call countrey ants to harvest offices, Love, all alike, no season knowes, nor clyme, Nor houres, dayes, moneths, which are the rags of time. Thy beames, so reverend, and strong Why shouldst thou thinke? I could eclipse and cloud them with a winke, But that I would not lose her sight so long: If her eyes have not blinded thine, Looke, and to morrow late, tell mee, Whether both the'India's of spice and Myne Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with mee. Aske for those Kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, And thou shalt heare, All here in one bed lay. She'is all States, and all Princes, I, Nothing else is. Princes doe but play us, compar'd to this, All honor's mimique; All wealth alchimie; Thou sunne art halfe as happy'as wee, In that the world's contracted thus. Thine age askes ease, and since thy duties bee To warme the world, that's done in warming us. Shine here to us, and thou art every where; This bed thy center is, these walls, thy spheare. The Indifferent. I can love both faire and browne, Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betraies, Her who loves lonenesse best, and her who maskes and plaies, Her wh? the country form'd, &amp; wh? the town, Her who beleeves, and her who tries, Her who still weepes with spungie eyes, And her who is dry corke, and never cries; I can love her, and her, and you and you, I can love any, so she be not true. Will no other vice content you? Wil it not serve your turn to do, as did your mothers? Or have you all old vices spent, and now would finde out others? Or doth a feare, that men are true, torment you? Oh we are not, be not you so, Let mee, and doe you, twenty know. Rob mee, but binde me not, and let me goe. Must I, who came to travaile thorow you, Grow your fixt subject, because you are true? Venus heard me sigh this song, And by Loves sweetest Part, Variety, she swore, She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more. She went, examin'd, and return'd ere long, And said, alas, Some two or three Poore Heretiques in love there bee, Which thinke to stablish dangerous constancie. But I have told them, since you will be true, You shall be true to them, who' are false to you. Loves Vsury. For every houre that thou wilt spare mee now, I will allow, Usurious God of Love, twenty to thee, When with my browne, my gray haires equall bee; Till then, Love, let my body raigne, and let Mee travell, sojourne, snatch, plot, have, forget, Resume my last yeares relict: thinke that yet We'had never met. Let mee thinke any rivalls letter mine, And at next nine Keepe midnights promise; mistake by the way The maid, and tell the Lady of that delay; Onely let mee love none, no, not the sport From country grasse, to comfitures of Court, Or cities quelque choses, let report My minde transport. This bargaine's good; if when I'am old, I bee Inflam'd by thee, If thine owne honour, or my shame, or paine, Thou covet most, at that age thou shalt gaine, Doe thy will then, then subject and degree, And fruit of love, Love I submit to thee, Spare mee till then, I'll beare it, though she bee One that loves mee. The Canonization. For Godsake hold your tongue, and let me love, Or chide my palsie, or my gout, My five gray haires, or ruin'd fortune flout, With wealth your state, your minde with Arts improve Take you a course, get you a place, Observe his honour, or his grace, Or the Kings reall, or his stamped face Contemplate, what you will, approve, So you will let me love. Alas, alas, who's injur'd by my love? What merchants ships have my sighs drown'd? Who saies my teares have overflow'd his ground? When did my colds a forward spring remove? When did the heats which my veines fill Adde one more, to the plaguie Bill? Soldiers finde warres, and Lawyers finde out still Litigious men, which quarrels move, Though she and I do love. Call us what you will, wee are made such by love; Call her one, mee another flye, We'are Tapers too, and at our owne cost die, And wee in us finde the'Eagle and the dove, The Phœnix ridle hath more wit By us, we two being one, are it. So, to one neutrall thing both sexes fit. Wee dye and rise the same, and prove Mysterious by this love. Wee can dye by it, if not live by love, And if unfit for tombes and hearse Our legends bee, it will be fit for verse; And if no peece of Chronicle wee prove, We'll build in sonnets pretty roomes; As well a well wrought urne becomes The greatest ashes, as halfe-acre tombes, And by these hymnes, all shall approve Us Canoniz'd for Love. And thus invoke us; You whom reverend love Made one anothers hermitage; You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage, Who did the whole worlds soule contract, &amp; drove Into the glasses of your eyes So made such mirrors, and such spies, That they did all to you epitomize, Countries, Townes, Courts: Beg frow above A patterne of our love. The triple Foole. I am two fooles, I know, For loving, and for saying so In whining Poëtry; But where's that wiseman, that would not be I, If she would not deny? Then as th'earths inward narrow crooked lanes Do purge sea waters fretfull salt away, I thought, if I could draw my paines, Through Rimes vexation, I should them allay, Griefe brought to numbers cannot be so fierce, For, he tames it, that fetters it in verse. But when I have done so, Some man, his art and voice to show, Doth Set and sing my paine, And, by delighting many, frees againe Griefe, which verse did restraine. To Love, and Griefe tribute of Verse belongs, But not of such as pleases when'tis read, Both are increased by such songs: For both their triumphs so are published, And I, which was two fooles, do so grow three; Who are a little wise, the best fooles bee. Lovers infinitenesse. If yet I have not all thy love, Deare, I shall never have it all, I cannot breath one other sigh, to move; Nor can intreat one other teare to fall. And all my treasure, which should purchase thee, Sighs, teares and oathes, and letters I have spent, Yet no more can be due to mee, Then at the bargaine made was ment, If then thy gift of love were partiall, That some to mee, some should to others fall, Deare, I shall never have Thee All. Or if then thou gavest mee all, All was but All, which thou hadst then, But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall, New love created bee, by other men, Which have their stocks intire, and can in teares, In sighs, in oathes, and letters outbid mee, This new love may beget new feares, For, this love was not vowed by thee, And yet is was, thy gift being generall, The ground, thy heart is mine, what ever shall Grow there, deare, I should have it all. Yet I would not have all yet, Hee that hath all can have no more, And since my love doth every day admit New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store, Thou canst not every day give me thy heart, If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it: Loves riddles are, that though thy heart depart, It stayes at home, and thou with losing savest it: But wee will have a way more liberall, Then changing hearts, to joyne them, so wee shall Be one, and one anothers All. Song. [Sweetest love, I do not goe] Sweetest love, I do not goe, For wearinesse of thee, Nor in hope the world can show A fitter Love for mee, But since that I Must dye at last, 'tis best, To use my selfe in jest Thus by fain'd deaths to dye; Yesternight the Sunne went hence, And yet is here to day, He hath no desire nor sense, Nor halfe so short a way: Then feare not mee, But beleeve that I shall make Speedier journeyes, since I take More wings and spurres then hee. O how feeble is mans power, That if good fortune fall, Cannot adde another houre, Nor a lost houre recall? But come bad chance, And wee joyne to 'it our strength, And wee teach it art and length, It selfe o'r us to'advance. When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not winde, But sigh'st my soule away, When thou weep'st, unkindly kinde, My lifes blood doth decay. It cannot bee That thou lov'st mee, as thou say'st, If in thine my life thou waste, Thou art the best of mee. Let not thy divining heart Forethinke me any ill, Destiny may take thy part, And may thy feares fulfill, But thinke that wee Are but turn'd aside to sleepe; They who one another keepe Alive, ne'r parted bee. The Legacie. When I dyed last, and, Deare, I dye As often as from thee I goe, Though it be but an houre agoe, And Lovers houres be full eternity, I can remember yet, that I Something did say, and something did bestow; Though I be dead, which sent mee, I should be Mine owne executor and Legacie. I heard mee say, Tell her anon, That my selfe, that's you, not I, Did kill me, and when I felt mee dye, I bid mee send my heart, when I was gone, But I alas could there finde none, When I had ripp'd me, 'and search'd where hearts did lye, It kill'd mee againe, that I who still was true, In life, in my last Will should cozen you. Yet I found something like a heart, But colours it, and corners had, It was not good, it was not bad, It was intire to none, and few had part. As good as could be made by art It seem'd, and therefore for our losses sad, I meant to send this heart in stead of mine, But oh, no man could hold it, for twas thine. A Feaver. Oh doe not die, for I shall hate All women so, when thou art gone, That thee I shall not celebrate, When I remember, thou wast one. But yet thou canst not die, I know, To leave this world behinde, is death, But when thou from this world wilt goe, The whole world vapors with thy breath. Or if, when thou, the worlds soule, goest, It stay, tis but thy carkasse then, The fairest woman, but thy ghost, But corrupt wormes, the worthyest men. O wrangling schooles, that search what fire Shall burne this world, had none the wit Unto this knowledge to aspire, That this her feaver might be it? And yet she cannot wast by this, Nor long beare this torturing wrong, For much corruption needfull is To fuell such a feaver long. These burning fits but meteors bee, Whose matter in thee is soone spent. Thy beauty, 'and all parts, which are thee, Are unchangeable firmament. Yet t'was of my minde, seising thee, Though it in thee cannot persever. For I had rather owner bee Of thee one houre, then all else ever. Aire and Angels. Twice or thrice had I loved thee, Before I knew thy face or name; So in a voice, so in a shapelesse flame, Angells affect us oft, and worship'd bee, Still when, to where thou wert, I came Some lovely glorious nothing I did see, But since, my soule, whose child love is, Takes limmes of flesh, and else could nothing doe, More subtile then the parent is, Love must not be, but take a body too, And therefore what thou wert, and who I bid Love aske, and now That it assume thy body, I allow, And fixe it selfe in thy lip, eye, and brow. Whilst thus to ballast love, I thought, And so more steddily to have gone, With wares which would sinke admiration, I saw, I had loves pinnace overfraught, Ev'ry thy haire for love to worke upon Is much too much, some fitter must be sought; For, nor in nothing, nor in things Extreme, and scattring bright, can love inhere; Then as an Angell, face, and wings Of aire, not pure as it, yet pure doth weare, So thy love may be my loves spheare; Just such disparitie As is twixt Aire and Angells puritie, 'Twixt womens love, and mens will ever bee. Breake of day. 'Tis true, 'tis day, what though it be? O wilt thou therefore rise from me? Why should we rise, because 'tis light? Did we lie downe, because 'twas night? Love which in spight of darknesse brought us hether, Should in despight of light keepe us together. Light hath no tongue, but is all eye; If it could speake as well as spie, This were the worst, that it could say, That being well, I faine would stay, And that I lov'd my heart and honor so, That I would not from him, that had them, goe. Must businesse thee from hence remove? Oh, that's the worst disease of love, The poore, the foule, the false, love can Admit, but not the busied man. He which hath businesse, and makes love, doth doe Such wrong, as when a maryed man doth wooe. The Anniversarie. All Kings, and all their favorites, All glory of honors, beauties, wits, The Sun it selfe, which makes times, as they passe, Is elder by a yeare, now, then it was When thou and I first one another saw: All other things, to their destruction draw, Only our love hath no decay; This, no to morrow hath, nor yesterday, Running it never runs from us away, But truly keepes his first, last, everlasting day. Two graves must hide thine and my coarse, If one might, death were no divorce, Alas, as well as other Princes, wee, (Who Prince enough in one another bee,) Must leave at last in death, these eyes, and eares, Oft fed with true oathes, and with sweet salt teares; But soules where nothing dwells but love; (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove This, or a love increased there above, When bodies to their graves, soules from their graves remove. And then wee shall be throughly blest, But now no more, then all the rest. Here upon earth, we'are Kings, and none but wee Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects bee; Who is so safe as wee? where none can doe Treason to us, except one of us two. True and false feares let us refraine, Let us love nobly, and live, and adde againe Yeares and yeares unto yeares, till we attaine To write threescore, this is the second of our raigne. A Valediction of my name, in the window. I My name engrav'd herein, Doth contribute my firmnesse to this glasse, Which, ever since that charme, hath beene As hard, as that which grav'd it, was, Thine eye will give it price enough, to mock The diamonds of either rock. II 'Tis much that Glasse should bee As all confessing, and through-shine as I, 'Tis more, that it shewes thee to thee, And cleare reflects thee to thine eye. But all such rules, loves magique can undoe, Here you see mee, and I am you. III As no one point, nor dash, Which are but accessaries to this name, The showers and tempests can outwash, So shall all times finde mee the same; You this intirenesse better may fulfill, Who have the patterne with you still. IIII Or if too hard and deepe This learning be, for a scratch'd name to teach, It, as a given deaths head keepe, Lovers mortalitie to preach, Or thinke this ragged bony name to bee My ruinous Anatomie. V Then, as all my soules bee, Emparadis'd in you, (in whom alone I understand, and grow and see,) The rafters of my body, bone Being still with you, the Muscle, Sinew, and Veine, Which tile this house, will come againe. VI Till my returne, repaire And recompact my scattered body so. As all the vertuous powers which are Fix'd in the starres, are said to flow, Into such characters, as graved bee When these starres have supremacie. VII So since this name was cut When love and griefe their exaltation had, No doore 'gainst this names influence shut, As much more loving, as more sad, 'Twill make thee; and thou shouldst, till I returne, Since I die daily, daily mourne. VIII When thy inconsiderate hand Flings ope this casement, with my trembling name, To looke on one, whose wit or land, New battry to thy heart may frame, Then thinke this name alive, and that thou thus In it offendst my Genius. IX And when thy melted maid, Corrupted by thy Lover's gold, and page, His letter at thy pillow'hath laid, Disputed it, and tam'd thy rage, And thou begin'st to thaw towards him, for this, May my name step in, and hide his. X And if this treason goe To an overt act, and that thou write againe; In superscribing, this name flow Into thy fancy, from the pane. So, in forgetting thou remembrest right, And unaware to mee shalt write. XI But glasse, and lines must bee, No meanes our firme substantiall love to keepe; Neere death inflicts this lethargie, And this I murmure in my sleepe; Impute this idle talke, to that I goe, For dying men talke often so. Twicknam garden. Blasted with sighs, and surrounded with teares, Hither I come to seeke the spring, And at mine eyes, and at mine eares, Receive such balmes, as else cure every thing, But O, selfe traytor, I do bring The spider love, which transubstantiates all, And can convert Manna to gall, And that this place may thoroughly be thought True Paradise, I have the serpent brought. 'Twere wholsomer for mee, that winter did Benight the glory of this place, And that a grave frost did forbid These trees to laugh and mocke mee to my face; But that I may not this disgrace Indure, nor yet leave loving, Love let mee Some senslesse peece of this place bee; Make me a mandrake, so I may grow here, Or a stone fountaine weeping out my yeare. Hither with chirstall vyals, lovers come, And take my teares, which are loves wine, And try your mistresse Teares at home, For all are false, that tast not just like mine; Alas, hearts do not in eyes shine, Nor can you more judge womens thoughts by teares, Then by her shadow, what she weares. O perverse sexe, where none is true but shee, Who's therefore true, because her truth kills mee. Valediction to his booke. I'll tell thee now (deare Love) what thou shalt doe To anger destiny, as she doth us, How I shall stay, though she Esloygue me thus And how posterity shall know it too; How thine may out-endure Sybills glory, and obscure Her who from Pindar could allure, And her, through whose helpe Lucan is not lame, And her, whose booke (they say) Homer did finde, and name. Study our manuscripts, those Myriades Of letters, which have past twixt thee and mee, Thence write our Annals, and in them will bee To all whom loves subliming fire invades, Rule and example found; There, the faith of any ground No schismatique will dare to wound, That sees, how Love this grace to us affords, To make, to keep, to use, to be these his Records. This Booke, as long-liv'd as the elements, Or as the worlds forme, this all-graved tome In cypher writ, or new made Idiome; Wee for loves clergie only'are instruments, When this booke is made thus, Should againe the ravenous Vandals and the Goths invade us, Learning were safe; in this our Universe Schooles might learne Sciences, Spheares Musick, Angels Verse. Here Loves Divines, (since all Divinity Is love or wonder) may finde all they seeke, Whether abstract spirituall love they like, Their Soules exhal'd with what they do not see, Or loth so to amuze, Faiths infirmitie, they chuse Something which they may see and use; For, though minde be the heaven, where love doth sit, Beauty a convenient type may be to figure it. Here more then in their bookes may Lawyers finde, Both by what titles, Mistresses are ours, And how prerogative these states devours, Transferr'd from Love himselfe, to womankinde. Who though from heart, and eyes, They exact great subsidies, Forsake him who on them relies And for the cause, honour, or conscience give, Chimeraes, vaine as they, or their prerogative. Here Statesmen, (or of them, they which can reade,) May of their occupation finde the grounds, Love and their art alike it deadly wounds, If to consider what 'tis, one proceed, In both they doe excell Who the present governe well, Whose weaknesse none doth, or dares tell; In this thy booke, such will there something see, As in the Bible some can finde out Alchimy. Thus vent thy thoughts; abroad I'll studie thee, As he removes farre off, that great heights takes; How great love is, presence best tryall makes, But absence tryes how long this love will bee; To take a latitude Sun, or starres, are fitliest view'd At their brightest, but to conclude Of longitudes, what other way have wee, But to marke when, and where the darke eclipses bee? [[Community.]] Good wee must love, and must hate ill, For ill is ill, and good good still, But these are things indifferent, Which wee may neither hate, nor love, But one, and then another prove, As wee shall finde our fancy bent. If then at first wise Nature had, Made women either good or bad, Then some wee might hate, and some chuse, But since shee did them so create, That we may neither love, nor hate, Onely this rests, All, all may use. If they were good it would be seene, Good is as visible as greene, And to all eyes it selfe betrayes, If they were bad, they could not last, Bad doth it selfe, and others wast, So, they deserve nor blame, nor praise. But they are ours as fruits are ours, He that but tasts, he that devours, And he that leaves all, doth as well, Chang'd loves are but chang'd sorts of meat, And when hee hath the kernell eate, Who doth not fling away the shell? Loves growth. I scarce beleeve my love to be so pure As I had thought it was, Because it doth endure Vicissitude, and season, as the grasse; Me thinkes I lyed all winter, when I swore, My love was infinite, if spring make'it more. But if this medicine, love, which cures all sorrow With more, not onely bee no quintessence, But mixt of all stuffes, paining soule, or sense, And of the Sunne his working vigour borrow, Love's not so pure, and abstract, as they use To say, which have no Mistresse but their Muse, But as all else, being elemented too, Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do And yet no greater, but more eminent, Love by the spring is growne; As, in the firmament, Starres by the Sunne are not inlarg'd, but showne, Gentle love deeds, as blossomes on a bough, From loves awakened root do bud out now. If, as in water stir'd more circles bee Produc'd by one, love such additions take, Those like so many spheares, but one heaven make, For, they are all concentrique unto thee, And though each spring doe adde to love new heate, As princes doe in times of action get New taxes, and remit them not in peace, No winter shall abate the springs encrease. Loves exchange. Love, any devill else but you, Would for a given Soule give something too. At Court your fellowes every day, Give th'art of Riming, Huntsmanship, or play, For them which were their owne before; Onely I have nothing which gave more, But am, alas, by being lowly, lower. I aske no dispensation now To falsifie a teare, or sigh, or vow, I do not sue from thee to draw A non obstante on natures law, These are prerogatives, they inhere In thee and thine; none should forsweare Except that hee Loves minion were. Give mee thy weaknesse, make mee blinde, Both wayes, as thou and thine, in eies and minde; Love, let me never know that this Is love, or, that love childish is. Let me not know that others know That she knowes my paines, least that so A tender shame make me mine owne new woe. If thou give nothing, yet thou'art just, Because I would not thy first motions trust; Small townes which stand stiffe, till great shot Enforce them, by warres law condition not. Such in loves warfare is my case, I may not article for grace, Having put love at last to shew this face. This face, by which he could command And change the Idolatrie of any land, This face, which wheresoe'r it comes, Can call vow'd men from cloisters, dead from tombes, And melt both Poles at once, and store Deserts with cities, and make more Mynes in the earth, then Quarries were before. For, this love is enrag'd with mee, Yet kills not; if I must example bee To future Rebells; If th'unborne Must learne, by my being cut up, and torne: Kill, and dissect me, Love; for this Torture against thine owne end is, Rack't carcasses make ill Anatomies. [[Confined Love.]] Some man unworthy to be possessor Of old or new love, himselfe being false or weake, Thought his paine and shame would be lesser, If on womankind he might his anger wreake, And thence a law did grow, One might but one man know; But are other creatures so? Are Sunne, Moone, or Starres by law forbidden, To smile where they list, or lend away their light? Are birds divorc'd, or are they chidden If they leave their mate, or lie abroad a night? Beasts doe no joyntures lose Though they new lovers choose, But we are made worse then those. Who e'r rigg'd faire ship to lie in harbors, And not to seeke new lands, or not to deale withall? Or built faire houses, set trees, and arbors, Only to lock up, or else to let them fall? Good is not good, unlesse A thousand it possesse, But doth wast with greedinesse. The Dreame. Deare love, for nothing lesse then thee Would I have broke this happy dreame, It was a theame For reason, much too strong for phantasie, Therefore thou wakd'st me wisely; yet My Dreame thou brok'st not, but continued'st it, Thou art so truth, that thoughts of thee suffice, To make dreames truths; and fables histories; Enter these armes, for since thou thoughtst it best, Not to dreame all my dreame, let's act the rest. As lightning, or a Tapers light, Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd mee; Yet I thought thee (For thou lovest truth) an Angell, at first sight, But when I saw thou sawest my heart, And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an Angels art, When thou knew'st what I dreamt, wh? thou knew'st wh? Excesse of joy would wake me, and cam'st then, I must confesse, it could not chuse but bee Prophane, to thinke thee any thing but thee. Comming and staying show'd thee, thee, But rising makes me doubt, that now, Thou art not thou. That love is weake, where feare's as strong as hee; 'Tis not all spirit, pure, and brave, If mixture it of Feare, Shame, Honor have; Perchance as torches which must ready bee, Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with mee, Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; Then I Will dreame that hope againe, but else would die. A Valediction of weeping. Let me powre forth My teares before thy face, whil'st I stay here, For thy face coines them, and thy stampe they beare, And by this Mintage they are something worth, For thus they bee Pregnant of thee, Fruits of much griefe they are, emblemes of more, When a teare falls, that thou falst which it bore, So thou and I are nothing then, when on a divers shore. On a round ball A workeman that hath copies by, can lay An Europe, Afrique, and an Asia, And quickly make that, which was nothing, All, So doth each teare, Which thee doth weare, A globe, yea world by that impression grow, Till thy teares mixt with mine doe overflow This world, by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so. O more then Moone, Draw not up seas to drowne me in thy spheare, Weepe me not dead, in thine armes, but forbeare To teach the sea, what it may doe too soone, Let not the winde Example finde, To doe me more harme, then it purposeth, Since thou and I sigh one anothers breath, Who e'r sighes most, is cruellest, and hasts the others death. Loves Alchymie. Some that have deeper digg'd loves Myne then I, Say, where his centrique happinesse doth lie: I have lov'd, and got, and told, But should I love, get, tell, till I were old, I should not finde that hidden mysterie; Oh, 'tis imposture all: And as no chymique yet th'Elixar got, But glorifies his pregnant pot, If by the way to him befall Some odoriferous thing, or medicinall, So, lovers dreame a rich and long delight, But get a winter-seeming summers night. Our ease, our thrift, our honor, and our day, Shall we, for this vaine Bubles shadow pay? Ends love in this, that my man, Can be as happy'as I can; If he can Endure the short scorne of a Bridegroomes play? That loving wretch that sweares, 'Tis not the bodies marry, but the mindes, Which he in her Angelique findes, Would sweare as justly, that he heares, In that dayes rude hoarse minstralsey, the spheares. Hope not for minde in women; at their best, Sweetnesse, and wit they'are, but, Mummy, possest. The Flea. Marke but this flea, and marke in this, How little that which thou deny'st me is; It suck'd me first, and now sucks thee, And in this flea, our two bloods mingled bee; Thou know'st that this cannot be said A sinne, nor shame nor losse of maidenhead, Yet this enjoyes before it wooe, And pamper'd swells with one blood made of two, And this, alas, is more then wee would doe. Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare, Where wee almost, yea more then maryed are. This flea is you and I, and this Our mariage bed, and mariage temple is; Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met, And cloysterd in these living walls of Jet. Though use make you apt to kill mee, Let not to that, selfe murder added bee, And sacrilege, three sinnes in killing three. Cruell and sodaine, hast thou since Purpled thy naile, in blood of innocence? Wherein could this flea guilty bee, Except in that drop which it suckt from thee? Yet thou triumph'st, and saist that thou Find'st not thy selfe, nor mee the weaker now; 'Tis true, then learne how false, feares bee; Just so much honor, when thou yeeld'st to mee, Will wast, as this flea's death tooke life from thee. The Curse. Who ever guesses, thinks, or dreames he knowes Who is my mistris, wither by this curse; His only, and only his purse May some dull heart to love dispose, And shee yeeld then to all that are his foes; May he be scorn'd by one, whom all else scorne, Forsweare to others, what to her he'hath sworne, With feare of missing, shame of getting torne; Madnesse his sorrow, gout his cramp, may hee Make, by but thinking, who hath made him such: And may he feele no touch Of conscience, but of fame, and bee Anguish'd, not that 'twas sinne, but that 'twas shee: In early and long scarcenesse may he rot, For land which had been his, if he had not Himselfe incestuously an heire begot: May he dreame Treason, and beleeve, that hee Meant to performe it, and confesse, and die, And no record tell why: His sonnes, which none of his may bee, Inherite nothing but his infamie: Or may he so long Parasites have fed, That he would faine be theirs, whom he hath bred, And at the last be circumcis'd for bread: The venom of all stepdames, gamsters gall, What Tyrans, and their subjects interwish, What Plants, Myne, Beasts, Foule, Fish, Can contribute, all ill, which all Prophets, or Poets spake; And all which shall Be annex'd in schedules unto this by mee, Fall on that man; For if it be a shee Nature before hand hath out-cursed mee. AN ANATOMIE OF THE WORLD. Wherein, By occasion of the untimely death of Mistris Elizabeth Drvry, the frailty and the decay of this whole World is represented. The first Anniversary. To the praise of the dead, and the Anatomie.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Well dy'd the World, that we might live to see This world of wit, in his Anatomie: No evill wants his good; so wilder heires Bedew their Fathers Tombes, with forced teares, Whose state requites their losse: whiles thus we gain, Well may wee walke in blacks, but not complaine. Yet how can I consent the world is dead While this Muse lives? which in his spirits stead Seemes to informe a World; and bids it bee, In spight of losse or fraile mortalitie? And thou the subject of this welborne thought, Thrice noble maid, couldst not have found nor sought A fitter time to yeeld to thy sad Fate, Then whiles this spirit lives, that can relate Thy worth so well to our last Nephews eyne, That they shall wonder both at his and thine: Admired match! where strives in mutuall grace The cunning pencill, and the comely face: A taske which thy faire goodnesse made too much For the bold pride of vulgar pens to touch; Enough is us to praise them that praise thee, And say, that but enough those prayses bee, Which hadst thou liv'd, had hid their fearfull head From th'angry checkings of thy modest red: Death barres reward and shame, when envy's gone, And gaine, 'tis safe to give the dead their owne. As then the wise Egyptians wont to lay More on their Tombes, then houses: these of clay, But those of brasse, or marble were: so wee Give more unto thy Ghost, then unto thee. Yet what wee give to thee, thou gav'st to us, And may'st but thanke thy selfe, for being thus: Yet what thou gav'st, and wert, O happy maid, Thy grace profest all due, where 'tis repayd. So these high songs that to thee suited bin Serve but to sound thy Makers praise and thine, Which thy deare soule as sweetly sings to him Amid the quire of Saints, and Seraphim, As any Angels tongue can sing of thee; The subjects differ, though the skill agree: For as by infant yeares men judge of age, Thy early love, thy vertues did presage, What high part thou bear'st in those best of songs, Whereto no burden, nor no end belongs. Sing on thou virgin Soule, whose lossfull gaine Thy lovesick parents have bewail'd in vaine; Never may thy Name be in our songs forgot, Till wee shall sing thy ditty and thy note. An Anatomy of the World. The first Anniversary. When that rich Soule which to her heaven is gone, Who all do celebrate, who know they have one, (For who is sure he hath a Soule, unlesse It see, and judge, and follow worthinesse, And by deeds praise it? hee who doth not this, May lodge an immate soule, but 'tis not his.) When that Queene ended here her progresse time, And, as t'her standing house to heaven did climbe, Where loath to make the Saints attend her long, She's now a part both of the Quire, and Song. This World, in that great earthquake languished; For in a common bath of teares it bled, Which drew the strongest vitall spirits out: But succour'd then with a perplexed doubt, Whether the world did lose, or gaine in this, (Because since now no other way there is, But goodnesse, to see her, whom all would see, All must endeavour to be good as shee.) This great consumption to a fever turn'd, And so the world had fits; it joy'd, it mourn'd; And, as men thinke, that Agues physick are, And th'Ague being spent, give over care. So thou sicke World, mistak'st thy selfe to bee Well, when alas, thou'rt in a Lethargie. Her death did wound and tame thee than, and than Thou might'st have better spar'd the Sunne, or man. That wound was deep, but 'tis more misery, That thou hast lost thy sense and memory. 'Twas heavy then to heare thy voyce of mone, But this is worse, that thou art speechlesse growne. Thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast Nothing but shee, and her thou hast o'rpast. For as a child kept from the Fount, untill A prince, expected long, come to fulfill The ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid, Had not her comming, thee her palace made: Her name defin'd thee, gave thee forme, and frame, And thou forgett'st to celebrate thy name. Some moneths she hath beene dead (but being dead, Measures of times are all determined) But long she'ath beene away, long, long, yet none Offers to tell us who it is that's gone. But as in states doubtfull of future heires, When sicknesse without remedie empaires The present Prince, they're loth it should be said, The Prince doth languish, or the Prince is dead: So mankinde feeling now a generall thaw, A strong example gone, equall to law; The Cyment which did faithfully compact, And glue all vertues, now resolv'd, and slack'd, Thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead, Or that our weaknesse was discovered In that confession; therefore spoke no more Then tongues, the Soule being gone, the losse deplore. But though it be too late to succour thee, Sicke World, yea, dead, yea putrified, since shee Thy'intrinsique balme, and thy preservative, Can never be renew'd, thou never live, I (since no man can make thee live) will try, What wee may gaine by thy Anatomy. Her death hath taught us dearely, that thou art Corrupt and mortall in thy purest part. Let no man say, the world it selfe being dead, 'Tis labour lost to have discovered The worlds infirmities, since there is none Alive to study this dissection; For there's a kinde of World remaining still, Though shee which did inanimate and fill The world, be gone, yet in this last long night, Her Ghost doth walke, that is, a glimmering light, A faint weake love of vertue, and of good, Reflects from her, on them which understood Her worth; and though she have shut in all day, The twilight of her memory doth stay; Which, from the carcasse of the old world, free, Creates a new world, and new creatures bee Produc'd: the matter and the stuffe of this, Her vertue, and the forme our practice is: And thought to be thus elemented, arme These creatures, from homeborne intrinsique harme, (For all assum'd unto this dignitie, So many weedlesse Paradises bee, Which of themselves produce no venemous sinne, Except some forraine Serpent bring it in) Yet because outward stormes the strongest breake, And strength it selfe by confidence growes weake, This new world may be safer, being told The sicknes of the WorldThe dangers and diseases of the old: For with due temper men doe then forgoe, Or covet things, when they their true worth know. Impossibility of healthThere is no health; Physitians say that wee, At best, enjoy but a neutralitie. And can there bee worse sicknesse, then to know That we are never well, nor can be so? Wee are borne ruinous: poore mothers cry, That children come not right, nor orderly; Except they headlong come and fall upon An ominous precipitation. How witty's ruine, how importunate Upon mankinde? it labour'd to frustrate Even Gods purpose; and made woman, sent For mans reliefe, cause of his languishment. They were to good ends, and they are so still, But accessory, and principall in ill; For that first marriage was our funerall: One woman at one blow, then kill'd us all, And singly, one by one, they kill us now. We doe delightfully our selves allow To that consumption; and profusely blinde, Wee kill our selves to propagate our kinde. And yet we do not that; we are not men: There is not now that mankinde, which was then, When as, the Sunne and man did seeme to strive, (Ioynt tenants of the world) who should survive. Shortnesse of life. When, Stagge, and Raven, and the long-liv'd tree, Compar'd with man, dy'd in minoritie, When, if a slow pac'd starre had stolne away From the observers marking, he might stay Two or three hundred yeares to see't againe, And then make up his observation plaine; When, as the age was long, the sise was great; Mans growth confess'd, and recompenc'd the meat; So spacious and large, that every Soule Did a faire Kingdome, and large Realme controule: And when the very stature, thus erect, Did that soule a good way towards heaven direct. Where is this mankinde now? who lives to age, Fit to be made Methusalem his page? Alas, we scarce live long enough to try Whether a true made clocke run right, or lie. Old Gransires talke of yesterday with sorrow: And for our children wee reserve to morrow. So short is life, that every pesant strives, In a torne house, or field, to have three lives. And as in lasting, so in length is man, Smalnesse of stature.Contracted to an inch, who was a spanne; For had a man at first in forrests stray'd, Or shipwrack'd in the Sea, one would have laid A wager, that an Elephant, or Whale, That met him, would not hastily assaile A thing so equall to him: now alas, The Fairies, and the Pigmies well may passe As credible; mankinde decayes so soone, We'are scarce our Fathers shadowes cast at noone: Onely death ads t'our length: nor are wee growne In stature to be men, till we are none. But this were light, did our lesse volume hold All the old Text; or had wee chang'd to gold Their silver, or dispos'd into lesse glasse Spirits of vertue, which then scatter'd was. But 'tis not so: w'are not retir'd, but dampt; And as our bodies so our mindes are crampt: 'Tis shrinking, not close weaving that hath thus, In minde, and body both bedwarfed us. Wee seeme ambitious, Gods whole worke t'undoe; Of nothing hee made us, and we strive too, To bring our selves to nothing backe; and wee Doe what wee can, to do't so soone as hee. With new diseases on our selves wee warre, And with new Physicke, a worse Engin farre. Thus man, this worlds Vice-Emperour, in whom All faculties, all graces are at home; And if in other creatures they appeare, They're but mans Ministers, and Legats there, To worke on their rebellions, and reduce Them to Civility, and to mans use. This man, whom God did wooe, and loth t'attend Till man came up, did downe to man descend, This man so great, that all that is, is his, Oh what a trifle, and poore thing he is! If man were any thing; he's nothing now: Helpe, or at least some time to wast, allow T'his other wants, yet when he did depart With her whom we lament, hee lost his heart. She, of whom th'Ancients seem'd to prophesie, When they call'd vertues by the name of shee; Shee in whom vertue was so much refin'd, That for allay unto so pure a minde Shee tooke the weaker Sex: shee that could drive The poysonous tincture, and the staine of Eve, Out of her thought, and deeds; and purifie All, by a true religious Alchymie; She, she is dead; shee's dead: when thou knowest this, Thou knowest how poore a trifling thing man is. And learn'st thus much by our Anatomie, The heart being perish'd, no part can be free. And that except thou feed (not banquet) on The supernaturall food, Religion: Thy better growth growes withered, and scant; Be more then man, or thou'rt lesse then an Ant. Then as mankinde, so is the worlds whole frame Quite out of joynt, almost created lame: For, before God had made up all the rest, Corruption entred, and deprav'd the best: It seis'd the Angells, and then first of all The world did in her cradle take a fall, And turn'd her braines, and tooke a generall maime, Wronging each joynt of th'universall frame. The noblest part, man, felt it first; and than Decay of nature in other parts.Both beasts and plants, curst in the curse of man, So did the world from the first houre decay, That evening was beginning of the day, And now the Springs and Sommers which we see, Like sonnes of women after fiftie bee. And new Philosophy calls all in doubt, The Element of fire is quite put out; The Sun is lost, and th'earth, and no mans wit Can well direct him where to looke for it. And freely men confesse that this world's spent, When in the Planets, and the firmament They seeke so many new; they see that this Is crumbled out againe to his Atomies. 'Tis all in peeces, all coherence gone; All just supply, and all Relation: Prince, Subject, Father, Sonne, are things forgot, For every man alone thinkes he hath got To be a Phœnix, and that then can bee None of that kinde, of which he is, but hee. This is the worlds condition now, and now She that should all parts to reunion bow, She that had all Magnetique force alone, To draw, and fasten sundred parts in one; She whom wise nature had invented then When she observ'd that every sort of men Did in their voyage in this worlds Sea stray, And needed a new compasse for their way; She that was best, and first originall Of all faire copies, and the generall Steward to Fate; she whose rich eyes, and breast, Guilt the West-Indies, and perfum'd the East, Whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow Spice on those Iles, and bad them still smell so, And that rich Indie which doth gold interre, Is but as single money coyn'd from her: She to whom this world must it selfe refer, As Suburbs, or the Microcosme of her, Shee, shee is dead; shee's dead: when thou knowest this Thou knowest how lame a criple this world is. And learn'st thus much by our Anatomy, That this worlds generall sicknesse doth not lie In any humour, or one certaine part; But as thou sawest it rotten at the heart, Thou seest a Hectique feaver hath got hold Of the whole substance, not to be contrould, And that thou hast but one way, not t'admit The worlds infection, to be none of it. For the worlds subtilst immateriall parts Feele this consuming wound, and ages darts. For the worlds beauty is decai'd, or gone, Disformity of parts.Beauty, that's colour, and proportion. We thinke the heavens enjoy their Sphericall Their round proportion embracing all, But yet their various and perplexed course, Observ'd in divers ages, doth enforce Men to finde out so many Eccentrique parts, Such divers downe right lines, such overthwarts, As disproportion that pure forme: It teares The Firmament in eight and forty sheires, And in these Constellations then arise New starres, and old doe vanish from our eyes: As though heav'n suffered earthquakes, peace or war, When new Towers rise, and old demolish't are. They have impal'd within a Zodiake The free-borne Sun, and keepe twelve Signes awake To watch his steps; the Goat and Crab controule, And fright him backe, who else to either Pole (Did not these tropiques fetter him) might runne: For his course is not round; nor can the Sunne Perfit a Circle, or maintaine his way One inch direct; but where he rose to day He comes no more, but with a couzening line, Steales by that point, and so is Serpentine: And seeming weary with his reeling thus, He meanes to sleepe, being now falne nearer us. So, of the Starres which boast that they doe runne In Circle still, none ends where he begun. All their proportion's lame, it sinkes, it swels. For of Meridians, and Parallels, Man hath weav'd out a net, and this net throwne Upon the Heavens, and now they are his owne. Loth to goe up the hill, or labour thus To goe to heaven, we make heaven come to us. We spur, we reine the starres, and in their race They're diversly content t'obey our peace. But keepes the earth her round proportion still? Doth not a Tenarus or higher hill Rise so high like a Rocke, that one might thinke The floating Moone would shipwrack there &amp; sinke? Seas are so deepe, that Whales being strucke to day, Perchance to morrow scarse at middle way Of their wish'd journies end, the bottome, die. And men, to sound depths, so much line untie, As one might justly thinke, that there would rise At end thereof, one of th'Antipodies: If under all, a vault infernall bee, (Which sure is spacious, except that we Invent another torment, that there must Millions into a straight hot roome be thrust) Then solidnesse, and roundnesse have no place. Are these but warts, and pockholes in the face Of th'earth; Thinke so: but yet confesse, in this The worlds proportion disfigured is; That those two legges whereon it doth rely, Disorder in the world. Reward and punishment are bent awry. And, Oh, it can no more be questioned, That beauties best, proportion, is dead, Since even griefe it selfe, which now alone Is left us, is without proportion. Shee by whose lines proportion should bee Examin'd, measure of all Symmetree, Whom had that Ancient seen, who thought soules made Of Harmony, he would at next have said That Harmony was shee, and thence infer That soules were but Resultances from her, And did from her into our bodies goe, As to our eyes, the formes from objects flow: Shee, who if those great Doctors truly said That the Arke to mans proportion was made, Had been a type for that, as that might be A type of her in this, that contrary Both Elements and Passions liv'd at peace In her, who caus'd all Civill war to cease. Shee, after whom, what forme soe'r we see, Is discord, and rude incongruitie; She, she is dead, she's dead; when thou know'st this, Thou knowest how ugly a monster this world is: And learn'st thus much by our Anatomie, That here is nothing to enamour thee: And that, not only faults in inward parts, Corruptions in our braines, or in our hearts, Poysoning the fountaines, whence our actions spring, Endanger us: but that if every thing Be not done fitly'and in proportion, To satisfie wise, and good lookers on, (Since most men be such as most thinke they bee) They're lothsome too, by this deformitie. For good, and well, must in our actions meet; Wicked is not much worse then indiscreet. But beauties other second Element, Colour, and lustre now, is as neere spent. And had the world his just proportion, Were it a ring still, yet the stone is gone. As a compassionate Turcoyse which doth tell By looking pale, the wearer is not well, As gold falls sicke being stung with Mercury, All the worlds parts of such complexion bee. When nature was most busie, the first weeke, Swadling the new borne earth, God seem'd to like That she should sport her selfe sometimes, and play, To mingle, and vary colours every day: And then, as though shee could not make enough, Himselfe his various Rainbow did allow, Sight is the noblest sense of any one, Yet sight hath only colour to feed on, And colour is decai'd: summers robe growes Duskie, and like an oft dyed garment showes. Our blushing red, which us'd in cheekes to spred, Is inward sunke, and only our soules are red. Perchance the world might have recovered, If she whom we lament had not beene dead: But shee, in whom all white, and red, and blew (Beauties ingredients) voluntary grew, As in an unvext Paradise; from whom Did all things verdure, and their lustre come, Whose composition was miraculous, Being all colour, all diaphanous, (For Ayre, and Fire but thick grosse bodies were, And liveliest stones but drowsie, and pale to her,) She, she is dead; shee's dead: when thou know'st this, Thou knowest how wan a Ghost this our world is: And learn'st thus much by our Anatomie, That it should more affright, then pleasure thee. And that, since all faire colour then did sinke, 'Tis now but wicked vanitie, to thinke Weaknesse in the want of correspondence of heaven and earth.To colour vicious deeds with good pretence, Or with bought colors to illude mens sense. Nor in ought more this worlds decay appeares, Then that her influence the heav'n forbeares, Or that the Elements doe not feele this, The father, or the mother barren is. The cloudes conceive not raine, or doe not powre, In the due birth time, downe the balmy showre; Th'ayre doth not motherly sit on the earth, To hatch her seasons, and give all things birth; Spring-times were common cradles, but are tombes; And false-conceptions fill the generall wombes; Th'ayre showes such Meteors, as none can see, Not only what they meane, but what they bee; Earth such new wormes, as would have troubled much Th'Ægyptian Mages to have made more such. What Artist now dares boast that he can bring Heaven hither, or constellate any thing, So as the influence of those starres may bee Imprison'd in an Hearbe, or Charme or Tree, And doe by touch, all which those stars could doe? The art is lost, and correspondence too. For heaven gives little, and the earth takes lesse, And man least knowes their trade and purposes. If this commerce twixt heaven and earth were not Embarr'd, and all this traffique quite forgot, She, for whose losse we have lamented thus, Would worke more fully, and pow'rfully on us: Since herbes, and roots, by dying lose not all, But they, yea ashes too, are medicinall, Death could not quench her vertue so, but that It would be (if not follow'd) wondred at: And all the world would be one dying swan, To sing her funerall praise, and vanish than. But as some Serpents poyson hurteth not, Except it be from the live Serpent shot, So doth her vertue need her here, to fit That unto us; shee working more then it. But shee, in whom to such maturity Vertue was growne, past growth, that it must die; She, from whose influence all impression came, But by receivers impotencies, lame, Who, though she could not transubstantiate All states to gold, yet guilded every state, So that some Princes have some temperance; Some Counsellers some purpose to advance The common profit; and some people have, Some stay, no more then Kings should give, to crave; Some women have some taciturnity, Some nunneries some graines of chastitie. She that did thus much, and much more could doe, But that our age was Iron, and rustie too, Shee, she is dead, she's dead; when thou knowst this, Thou knowst how drie a Cinder this world is. And learn'st thus much by our Anatomy, That 'tis in vaine to dew, or mollifie It with thy teares, or sweat, or blood: nothing Is worth our travaile, griefe, or perishing, But those rich joyes, which did possesse her heart, Of which she's now partaker, and a part. Conclusion.But as in cutting up a man that's dead, The body will not last out, to have read On every part, and therefore men direct Their speech to parts, that are of most effect; So the worlds carcasse would not last, if I Were punctuall in this Anatomy; Nor smels it well to hearers, if one tell Them their disease, who faine would think thy're well. Here therefore be the end: and, blessed maid, Of whom is meant what ever hath been said, Or shall be spoken well by any tongue, Whose name refines course lines, and makes prose song, Accept this tribute, and his first yeares rent, Who till his darke short tapers end be spent, As oft as thy feast sees this widowed earth, Will yearely celebrate thy second birth, That is, thy death; for though the soule of man Be got when man is made, 'tis borne but than When man doth die; our body's as the wombe, And, as a Mid-wife, death directs it home. And you her creatures, whom she workes upon, And have your last, and best concoction From her example, and her vertue, if you In reverence to her, do thinke it due, That no one should her praises thus rehearse, As matter fit for Chronicle, not verse; Vouchsafe to call to minde that God did make A last, and lasting'st peece, a song. He spake To Moses to deliver unto all, That song, because hee knew they would let fall The Law, the Prophets, and the History, But keepe the song still in their memory: Such an opinion, in due measure, made Me this great office boldly to invade: Nor could incomprehensiblenesse deterre Mee, from thus trying to emprison her, Which when I saw that a strict grave could doe, I saw not why verse might not do so too. Verse hath a middle nature, heaven keepes Soules, The Grave keepes bodies, Verse the Fame enroules. A Funerall Elegie. 'Tis lost to trust a Tombe with such a guest, Or to confine her in a marble chest, Alas, what's Marble, Jeat, or Porphyrie, Priz'd with the Chrysolite of either eye, Or with those Pearles, and Rubies, which she was? Joyne the two Indies in one Tombe, 'tis glasse; And so is all to her materials, Though every inch were ten Escurials; Yet she's demolish'd: can wee keepe her then In works of hands, or of the wits of men? Can these memorials, ragges of paper, give Life to that name, by which name they must live? Sickly, alas, short-liv'd, aborted bee Those carcasse verses, whose soule is not shee. And can shee, who no longer would be shee, Being such a Tabernacle, stoop to be In paper wrapt; or when shee would not lie In such a house, dwell in an Elegie? But 'tis no matter; wee may well allow Verse to live so long as the world will now, For her death wounded it. The world containes Princes for armes, and counsellors for braines, Lawyers for tongues, Divines for hearts, and more, The rich for stomackes, and for backs the poore; The officers for hands, merchants for feet, By which, remote and distant Countries meet. But those fine spirits which do tune, and set This Organ, are those peeces, which beget Wonder and love; and these were shee; and shee Being spent, the world must needs decrepit bee; For since death will proceed to triumph still, He can finde nothing, after her, to kill, Except the world it selfe, so great was shee. Thus brave and confident may Nature bee, Death cannot give her such another blow, Because shee cannot such another show. But must wee say she's dead? may't not be said That as a sundred clocke is peecemeale laid, Not to be lost, but by the makers hand Repollish'd, without errour then to stand, Or as the Affrique Niger streame enwombs It selfe into the earth, and after comes (Having first made a naturall bridge, to passe For many leagues) farre greater then it was, May't not be said, that her grave shall restore Her, greater, purer, firmer, then before? Heaven may say this, and joy in't, but can wee Who live, and lacke her, here, this vantage see? What is't to us, alas, if there have beene An Angell made a Throne, or Cherubin? Wee lose by't: and as aged men are glad Being tastlesse growne, to joy in joyes they had, So now the sick starv'd world must feed upon This joy, that we had her, who now is gone. Rejoyce then Nature, and this World, that you, Fearing the last fires hastning to subdue Your force and vigour, ere it were neere gone, Wisely bestow'd and laid it all on one; One, whose cleare body was so pure and thinne, Because it need disguise no thought within. 'Twas but a through-light scarfe, her minde t'inroule; Or exhalation breath'd out from her Soule. One, whom all men who durst no more, admir'd: And whom, who ere had worke enough, desir'd; As when a Temple's built, Saints emulate To which of them, it shall be consecrate. But, as when heaven lookes on us with new eyes, Those new starres every Artist exercise, VVhat place they should assigne to them they doubt, Argue, 'and agree not, till those starres goe out: So the world studied whose this peece should be, Till shee can be no bodies else, nor shee: But like a Lampe of Balsamum, desir'd Rather t'adorne, then last, she soone expir'd, Cloath'd in her virgin white integritie, For marriage, though it doth not staine, doth die. To scape th'infirmities which wait upon VVoman, she went away, before sh'was one; And the worlds busie noyse to overcome, Tooke so much death, as serv'd for opium; For though she could not, nor could chuse to dye, She'ath yeelded to too long an extasie: Hee which not knowing her said History, Should come to reade the booke of destiny, How faire, and chast, humble, and high she'ad been, Much promis'd, much perform'd, at not fifteene, And measuring future things, by things before, Should turne the leafe to reade, and reade no more, VVould thinke that either destiny mistooke, Or that some leaves were torne out of the booke. But 'tis not so; Fate did but usher her To yeares of reasons use, and then inferre Her destiny to her selfe, which liberty She tooke, but for thus much, thus much to die. Her modestie not suffering her to bee Fellow-Commissioner with Destinie, She did no more but die; if after her Any shall live, which dare true good prefer; Every such person is her deligate, T'accomplish that which should have beene her Fate. They shall make up that Booke and shall have thanks Of Fate, and her, for filling up their blankes. For future vertuous deeds are Legacies, VVhich from the gift of her example rise; And 'tis in heav'n part of spirituall mirth, To see how well the good play her, on earth. OF THE PROGRESSE OF THE SOULE. Wherein, By occasion of the Religious death of Mistris Elizabeth Drvry, the incommodities of the Soule in this life, and her exaltation in the next, are contemplated. The second Anniversary. The Harbinger to the PROGRESSE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Two Soules move here, and mine (a third) must move Paces of admiration, and of love; Thy Soule (deare virgin) whose this tribute is, Mov'd from this mortall Spheare to lively blisse; And yet moves still, and still aspires to see The worlds last day, thy glories full degree: Like as those starres which thou o'r-lookest farre, Are in their place, and yet still moved are: No soule (whiles with the luggage of this clay It clogged is) can follow thee halfe way; Or see thy flight, which doth our thoughts outgoe So fast, that now the lightning moves but slow: But now thou art as high in heaven flowne As heaven's from us; what soule besides thine owne Can tell thy joyes, or say he can relate Thy glorious Journals in that blessed state? I envie thee (Rich soule) I envy thee, Although I cannot yet thy glory see: And thou (great spirit) which hers follow'd hast So fast, as none can follow thine so fast; So far, as none can follow thine so farre, (And if this flesh did not the passage barre Hadst caught her) let me wonder at thy flight Which long agone hadst lost the vulgar sight, And now mak'st proud the better eyes, that they Can see thee less'ned in thine ayery way; So while thou mak'st her soule by progresse knowne Thou mak'st a noble progresse of thine owne. From this worlds carkasse having mounted high To that pure life of immortalitie; Since thine aspiring thoughts themselves so raise That more may not beseeme a creatures praise, Yet still thou vow'st her more; and every yeare Mak'st a new progresse, while thou wandrest here; Still upward mount; and let thy Makers praise Honor thy Laura, and adorne thy laies. And since thy Muse her head in heaven shrouds, Oh let her never stoope below the clouds: And if those glorious sainted soules may know Or what wee doe, or what wee sing below, Those acts, those songs shall still content them best Which praise those awfull Powers that make them blest. OF THE PROGRESSE OF THE SOULE. The second Anniversarie. Nothing could make me sooner to confesse That this world had an everlastingnesse, Then to consider, that a yeare is runne, Since both this lower world's, and the Sunnes Sunne, The Lustre, and the vigor of this all, Did set; 'twere blasphemie to say, did fall. But as a ship which hath strooke saile, doth runne By force of that force which before, it wonne: Or as sometimes in a beheaded man, Though at those two Red seas, which freely ranne, One from the Trunke, another from the Head, His soule he sail'd, to her eternall bed, His eyes will twinckle, and his tongue will roll, As though he beckned, and cal'd backe his soule, He graspes his hands, and he pulls up his feet, And seemes to reach, and to step forth to meet His soule; when all these motions which we saw, Are but as Ice, which crackles at a thaw: Or as a Lute, which in moist weather, rings Her knell alone, by cracking of her strings. So struggles this dead world, now shee is gone; For there is motion in corruption. As some daies are, at the Creation nam'd, Before the Sunne, the which fram'd daies, was fram'd: So after this Sunne's set, some shew appeares, And orderly vicissitude of yeares. Yet a new deluge, and of Lethe flood, Hath drown'd us all, All have forgot all good, Forgetting her, the maine reserve of all, Yet in this deluge, grosse and generall, Thou seest me strive for life; my life shall bee, To be hereafter prais'd, for praysing thee; Immortall maid, who though thou would'st refuse The name of Mother, be unto my Muse A Father, since her chast Ambition is Yearely to bring forth such a child as this. These Hymnes may worke on future wits, and so May great Grand children of thy prayses grow. And so, though not revive, embalme and spice The world, which else would putrifie with vice. For thus, Man may extend thy progeny, Untill man doe but vanish, and not die. These Hymnes thy issue, may encrease so long, As till Gods great Venite change the song. Thirst for that time, O my insatiate soule, A iust disestimation of this world. And serve thy thirst, with Gods safe-fealing Bowle. Be thirstie still, and drinke still till thou goe To th'only Health, to be Hydroptique so, Forget this rotten world; And unto thee Let thine owne times as an old storie bee Be not concern'd: studie not why nor when; Doe not so much as not beleeve a man. For though to erre, be worst, to try truths forth, Is far more businesse, then this world is worth. The world is but a carkasse; thou art fed By it, but as a worme, that carkasse bred; And why should'st thou, poore worme, consider more When this world will grow better then before, Then those thy fellow wormes doe thinke upon That carkasses last resurrection. Forget this world, and scarce thinke of it so, As of old clothes, cast off a yeare agoe. To be thus stupid is Alacritie; Men thus Lethargique have best Memory. Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state: We now lament not, but congratulate. Shee, to whom all this world was but a stage, Where all sat harkning how her youthfull age Should be emploi'd, because in all shee did, Some Figure of the Golden times was hid. Who could not lacke, what e'r this world could give, Because shee was the forme, that made it live; Nor could complaine, that this world was unfit To be staid in, then when shee was in it; Shee that first tried indifferent desires By vertue, and vertue by religious fires, Shee to whose person Paradise adher'd, As Courts to Princes, shee whose eyes ensphear'd Star-light enough, t'have made the South controule, (Had shee beene there) the Star-full Northerne Pole, Shee, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this, What fragmentary rubbidge this world is Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought; He honors it too much that thinkes it nought. Thinke then, my soule, that death is but a Groome, Contemplation of our state in our death-bed. Which brings a Taper to the outward roome, Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light, And after brings it nearer to thy sight: For such approaches doth heaven make in death. Thinke thy selfe labouring now with broken breath, And thinke those broken and soft Notes to bee Division, and thy happyest Harmonie. Thinke thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slacke; And thinke that, but unbinding of a packe, To take one precious thing, thy soule from thence. Thinke thy selfe patch'd with fevers violence, Anger thine ague more, by calling it Thy Physicke; chide the slacknesse of the fit. Thinke that thou hear'st thy knell and think no more, But that, as Bels cal'd thee to Church before, So this, to the Triumphant Church, calls thee. Thinke Satans Sergeants round about thee bee, And thinke that but for Legacies they thrust; Give one thy Pride, to'another give thy Lust: Give them those sinnes which they gave thee before, And trust th'immaculate blood to wash thy score. Thinke thy friends weeping round, &amp; thinke that they Weepe but because they goe not yet thy way. Thinke that they close thine eyes, and thinke in this, That they confesse much in the world, amisse, Who dare not trust a dead mans eye with that, Which they from God, and Angels cover not. Thinke that they shroud thee up, &amp; think from thence They reinvest thee in white innocence. Thinke that thy body rots, and (if so low, Thy soule exalted so, thy thoughts can goe,) Think thee a Prince, who of themselves create Wormes which insensibly devoure their State. Thinke that they bury thee, and thinke that right Laies thee to sleepe but a Saint Lucies night. Thinke these things cheerefully: and if thou bee Drowsie or slacke, remember then that shee, Shee whose complexion was so even made, That which of her ingredients should invade The other three, no Feare, no Art could guesse: So far were all remov'd from more or lesse. But as in Mithridate, or just perfumes, Where all good things being met, no one presumes To governe, or to triumph on the rest, Only because all were, no part was best. And as, though all doe know, that quantities Are made of lines, and lines from Points arise, None can these lines or quantities unjoynt, And say this is a line, or this a point: So though the Elements and Humors were In her, one could not say, this governes there, Whose even constitution might have woon Any disease to venter on the Sunne, Rather then her: and make a spirit feare, That hee too disuniting subject were. To whose proportions if we would compare Cubes, th'are unstable; Circles, Angular; She who was such a chaine as Fate employes To bring mankinde all Fortunes it enjoyes; So fast, so even wrought, as one would thinke, No accident could threaten any linke; Shee, shee embrac'd a sicknesse, gave it meat, The purest blood, and breath, that e'r it eate; And hath taught us, that though a good man hath Title to heaven, and plead it by his Faith, And though he may pretend a conquest, since Heaven was content to suffer violence, Yea though hee plead a long possession too, (For they're in heaven on earth who heavens workes do) Though hee had right and power and place, before, Yet death must usher, and unlocke the doore. Thinke further on thy selfe, my Soule, and thinke How thou at first wast made but in a sinke; Thinke that it argued some infirmitie, That those two soules, which then thou foundst in me, Thou fedst upon, and drewst into thee both My second soule of sense, and first of growth. Thinke but how poore thou wast, how obnoxious; Whom a small lumpe of flesh could poyson thus. This curded milke, this poore unlittered whelpe My body, could, beyond escape or helpe, Infect thee with Originall sinne, and thou Couldst neither then refuse, nor leave it now. Thinke that no stubborne sullen Anchorit, Which fixt to a pillar, or a grave, doth sit Bedded, and bath'd in all his ordures, dwels So fowly as our Soules in their first built Cels. Thinke in how poore a prison thou didst lie After, enabled but to suck, and crie. Thinke, when 'twas growne to most, 'twas a poore Inne, A Province pack'd up in two yards of skinne, And that usurp'd or threatned with a rage Of sicknesses, or their true mother, Age. But thinke that death hath now enfranchis'd thee, Her liberty by death.Thou hast thy'expansion now, and libertie; Thinke that a rustie Peece discharg'd is flowne In peeces, and the bullet is his owne, And freely flies: this to thy Soule allow, Thinke thy shell broke, thinke thy Soule hatch'd but now And think this slow-pac'd soule which late did cleave To'a body, and went but by the bodies leave, Twenty perchance or thirty mile a day, Dispatches in a minute all the way Twixt heaven, and earth; she stayes not in the ayre, To looke what Meteors there themselves prepare; She carries no desire to know, nor sense, Whether th'ayres middle region be intense; For th'Element of fire, she doth not know, Whether she past by such a place or no; She baits not at the Moone, nor cares to trie Whether in that new world, men live, and die. Venus retards her not, to'enquire, how shee Can, (being one starre) Hesper, and Vesper bee; Hee that charm'd Argus eyes, sweet Mercury, Workes not on her, who now is growne all eye; Who if she meet the body of the Sunne, Goes through, not staying till his course be runne; Who findes in Mars his Campe no corps of Guard; Nor is by Iove, nor by his father bard; But ere she can consider how she went, At once is at, and through the Firmament. And as these starres were but so many beads Strung on one string, speed undistinguish'd leads Her through those Spheares, as through the beads, a string, Whose quick successi? makes it still one thing: As doth the pith, which, left our bodies slacke, Strings fast the little bones of necke, and backe; So by the Soule doth death string Heaven and Earth; For when our Soule enjoyes this her third birth, (Creation gave her one, a second, grace,) Heaven is as neare, and present to her face, As colours are, and objects, in a roome Where darknesse was before, when Tapers come. This must, my Soule, thy long-short Progresse bee, To'advance these thoughts; Remember then that she, She, whose faire body no such prison was, But that a Soule might well be pleas'd to passe An age in her; she whose rich beauty lent Mintage to other beauties, for they went But for so much as they were like to her; Shee, in whose body (if we dare preferre This low world, to so high a marke as shee,) The Westerne treasure, Easterne spicetie, Europe, and Afrique, and the unknowne rest Were easily found, or what in them was best; And when w'have made this large discoverie Of all, in her some one part then will bee Twenty such parts, whose plenty and riches is Enough to make twenty such worlds as this; Shee, whom had they knowne who did first betroth The Tutelar Angels, and assigned one, both To Nations, Cities, and to Companies, To Functions, Offices, and dignities, And to each severall man, to him, and him, They would have given her one for every limbe; She, of whose soule, if wee may say, 'twas gold, Her body was th'Electrum, and did hold Many degrees of that; wee understood Her by her sight; her pure, and eloquent blood Spoke in her cheekes, and so distinctly wrought, That one might almost say, her body thought; Shee, shee, thus richly and largely hous'd, is gone: And chides us slow-pac'd snailes who crawle upon Our prisons prison, earth, nor thinke us well, Longer, then whil'st wee beare our brittle shell. But 'twere but little to have chang'd our roome, If, as we were in this our living Tombe Oppress'd with ignorance, wee still were so. Poore soule, in this thy flesh what dost thou know? Thou know'st thy selfe so little, as thou know'st not, How thou didst die, nor how thou wast begot. Thou neither know'st, how thou at first cam'st in, Nor how thou took'st the poyson of mans sinne. Nor dost thou, (though thou know'st, that thou art so) By what way thou art made immortall, know. Thou art too narrow, wretch, to comprehend Even thy selfe: yea though thou wouldst but bend To know thy body. Have not all soules thought For many ages, that our body'is wrought Of aire, and fire, and other Elements? And now they thinke of new ingredients. And one Soule thinkes one, and another way Another thinkes, and 'tis an even lay. Knowst thou but how the stone doth enter in The bladders cave, and never brake the skinne? Know'st thou how blood, which to the heart doth flow, Doth from one ventricle to th'other goe? And for the putrid stuffe, which thou dost spit, Know'st thou how thy lungs have attracted it? There are no passages, so that there is (For ought thou know'st) piercing of substances. And of those many opinions which men raise Of Nailes and Haires, dost thou know which to praise? What hope have wee to know our selves, when wee Know not the least things, which for our use be? Wee see in Authors, too stiffe to recant, A hundred controversies of an Ant; And yet one watches, starves, freeses, and sweats, To know but Catechismes and Alphabets Of unconcerning things, matters of fact; How others on our stage their parts did Act; What Cæsar did, yea, and what Cicero said, Why grasse is greene, or why our blood is red, Are mysteries which none have reach'd unto. In this low forme, poore soule, what wilt thou doe? When wilt thou shake off this Pedantery, Of being taught by sense, and Fantasie? Thou look'st through spectacles; small things seeme great Below; But up unto the watch-towre get, And see all things despoyl'd of fallacies: Thou shalt not peepe through lattices of eyes, Nor heare through Labyrinths of eares, nor learne By circuit, or collections to discerne. In heaven thou straight know'st all, concerning it, And what concernes it not, shalt straight forget. There thou (but in no other schoole) maist bee Perchance, as learned, and as full, as shee, Shee who all libraries had throughly read At home in her owne thoughts, and practised So much good as would make as many more: Shee whose example they must all implore, Who would or doe, or thinke well, and confesse That all the vertuous Actions they expresse, Are but a new, and worse edition Of her some one thought, or one action: She who in th'art of knowing Heaven, was growne Here upon earth, to such perfection, That she hath, ever since to Heaven she came, (In a far fairer point,) but read the same: Shee, shee not satisfied with all this waight, (For so much knowledge, as would over-fraight Another, did but ballast her) is gone As well t'enjoy, as get perfection. And cals us after her, in that shee tooke, (Taking her selfe) our best, and worthiest booke. Of our company in this life, and in the next. Returne not, my Soule, from this extasie, And meditation of what thou shalt bee, To earthly thoughts, till it to thee appeare, With whom thy conversation must be there, With whom wilt thou converse? what station Canst thou chose out, free from infection, That will not give thee theirs, nor drinke in thine? Shalt thou not finde a spungie slacke Divine, Drinke and sucke in th'instructions of great men, And for the word of God, vent them agen? Are there not some Courts (and then, no things bee So like as Courts) which, in this let us see, That wits, and tongues of Libellers are weake, Because they do more ill, then these can speake? The poyson's gone through all, poysons affect Chiefly the chiefest parts, but some, effect In nailes, and haires, yea excrements, will show; So lyes the poyson of sinne in the most low. Up, up, my drowsie Soule, where thy new eare Shall in the Angels songs no discord heare; Where thou shalt see the blessed Mother-maid Joy in not being that, which men have said. Where she is exalted more for being good, Then for her interest of Mother-hood. Up to those Patriarchs, which did longer sit Expecting Christ, then they'have enjoy'd him yet. Up to those Prophets, which now gladly see Their Prophesies growne to be Historie. Up to th'Apostles, who did bravely runne All the Suns course, with more light then the Sunne. Up to those Martyrs, who did calmly bleed Oyle to th'Apostles Lamps, dew to their seed. Up to those Virgins, who thought, that almost They made joyntenants with the Holy Ghost, If they to any should his Temple give. Up, up, for in that squadron there doth live She, who hath carried thither new degrees (As to their number) to their dignities. Shee, who being to her selfe a State, injoy'd All royalties which any State employ'd; For shee made warres, and triumph'd; reason still Did not o'rthrow, but rectifie her will: And she made peace, for no peace is like this, That beauty, and chastity together kisse: She did high justice, for she crucified Every first motion of rebellious pride: And she gave pardons, and was liberall, For, onely her selfe except, she pardon'd all: Shee coy'nd, in this, that her impression gave To all our actions all the worth they have: She gave protections; the thoughts of her brest Satans rude Officers could ne'r arrest. As these prerogatives being met in one, Made her a soveraigne State; religion Made her a Church; and these two made her all. She who was all this All, and could not fall To worse, by company, (for she was still More Antidote, then all the world was ill, Shee, shee doth leave it, and by Death, survive All this, in Heaven; whether who doth not strive The more, because shees there, he doth not know That accidentall joyes in Heaven doe grow. But pause, my soule; And study ere thou fall On accidentall joyes, th'essentiall. Still before Accessories doe abide Of essentiall joy in this life and in the next. A triall, must the principall be tride. And what essentiall joy can'st thou expect Here upon earth? what permanent effect Of transitory causes? Dost thou love Beauty? (And beauty worthy'st is to move) Poore cousened cousenor, that she, and that thou, Which did begin to love, are neither now; You are both fluid, chang'd since yesterday; Next day repaires, (but ill) last dayes decay. Nor are, (although the river keepe the name) Yesterdaies waters, and to daies the same. So flowes her face, and thine eyes; neither now That Saint nor Pilgrime, which your loving vow Concern'd, remaines; but whil'st you thinke you bee Constant, you'are hourely in inconstancie. Honour may have pretence unto our love, Because that God did live so long above Without this Honour, and then lov'd it so, That he at last made creatures to bestow Honour on him; not that he needed it, But that, to his hands, man might grow more fit. But since all Honours from inferiours flow, (For they doe give it; Princes doe but shew Whom they would have so honor'd) and that this On such opinions, and capacities Is built, as rise and fall, to more and lesse: Alas, 'tis but a casuall happinesse. Hath ever any man to'himselfe assign'd This or that happinesse to'arrest his minde, But that another man which takes a worse, Thinks him a foole for having tane that course? They who did labour Babels tower to'erect, Might have considered, that for that effect, All this whole solid Earth could not allow Nor furnish forth materialls enough; And that his Center, to raise such a place Was farre too little, to have beene the Base; No more affords this world, foundation To erect true joy, were all the meanes in one. But as the Heathen made them severall gods, Of all Gods benefits, and all his rods, (For as the Wine, and Corne, and Onions are Gods unto them, so Agues bee, and warre) And as by changing that whole precious Gold To such small Copper coynes, they lost the old, And lost their only God, who ever must Be sought alone, and not in such a thrust: So much, mankinde true happinesse mistakes; No Joy enjoyes that man, that many makes. Then, Soule, to thy first pitch worke up againe; Know that all lines which circles doe containe, For once that they the Center touch, doe touch Twice the circumference; and be thou such; Double on heaven thy thoughts on earth emploid; All will not serve; Only who have enjoy'd The sight of God, in fulnesse, can thinke it; For it is both the object, and the wit. This is essentiall joy, where neither hee Can suffer diminution, nor wee; 'Tis such a full, and such a filling good; Had th'Angels once look'd on him, they had stood. To fill the place of one of them, or more, Shee whom wee celebrate, is gone before. She, who had here so much essentiall joy, As no chance could distract, much lesse destroy; Who with Gods presence was acquainted so, (Hearing, and speaking to him) as to know His face in any naturall Stone, or Tree, Better then when in Images they bee: Who kept by diligent devotion, Gods Image, in such reparation, Within her heart, that what decay was growne, Was her first Parents fault, and not her owne: Who being solicited to any act, Still heard God pleading his safe precontract; Who by a faithfull confidence, was here Betroth'd to God, and now is married there; Whose twilights were more cleare, then our mid-day; Who dreamt devoutlier, then most use to pray; Who being here fil'd with grace, yet strove to bee, Both where more grace, and more capacitie At once is given: she to Heaven is gone, Who made this world in some proportion A heaven, and here, became unto us all, Joy, (as our joyes admit) essentiall. But could this low world joyes essentiall touch, Of accidentall joyes in both places. Heavens accidentall joyes would passe them much. How poore and lame, must then our casuall bee? If thy Prince will his subjects to call thee My Lord, and this doe swell thee, thou art than, By being greater, growne to bee lesse Man. When no Physitian of redresse can speake, A joyfull casuall violence may breake A dangerous Apostem in thy breast; And whil'st thou joyest in this, the dangerous rest, The bag may rise up, and so strangle thee. What e'r was casuall, may ever bee. What should the nature change? Or make the same Certaine, which was but casuall, when it came? All casuall joy doth loud and plainly say, Only by comming, that it can away. Only in Heaven joyes strength is never spent; And accidentall things are permanent. Joy of a soules arrivall ne'r decaies; For that soule ever joyes and ever staies. Joy that their last great Consummation Approaches in the resurrection; When earthly bodies more celestiall Shall be, then Angels were, for they could fall; This kinde of joy doth every day admit Degrees of growth, but none of losing it. In this fresh joy, 'tis no small part, that shee, Shee, in whose goodnesse, he that names degree, Doth injure her; ('Tis losse to be cal'd best, There where the stuffe is not such as the rest) Shee, who left such a bodie, as even shee Only in Heaven could learne, how it can bee Made better; for shee rather was two soules, Or like to full on both sides written Rols, Where eyes might reade upon the outward skin, As strong Records for God, as mindes within, Shee, who by making full perfection grow, Peeces a Circle, and still keepes it so, Long'd for, and longing for it, to heaven is gone, Where shee receives, and gives addition. Here in a place, where mis-devotion frames Conclusion. A thousand Prayers to Saints, whose very names The anci?t Church knew not, Heaven knows not yet: And where, what lawes of Poetry admit, Lawes of Religion have at least the same, Immortall Maide, I might invoke thy name. Could any Saint provoke that appetite, Thou here should'st make me a french convertite. But thou would'st not; nor would'st thou be content, To take this, for my second yeares true Rent. Did this Coine beare any other stampe, then his, That gave thee power to doe, me, to say this. Since his will is, that to posteritie, Thou should'st for life, and death, a patterne bee, And that the world should notice have of this, The purpose, and th'authoritie is his; Thou art the Proclamation; and I am The Trumpet, at whose voyce the people came. The Extasie. Where, like a pillow on a bed, A Pregnant banke swel'd up, to rest The violets reclining head, Sat we two, one anothers best; Our hands were firmely cimented With a fast balme, which thence did spring, Our eye-beames twisted, and did thred Our eyes, upon one double string, So to'entergraft our hands, as yet Was all the meanes to make us one, And pictures in our eyes to get Was all our propagation. As'twixt two equall Armies, Fate Suspends uncertaine victorie, Our soules, (which to advance their state, Were gone out,) hung 'twixt her, and mee. And whil'st our soules negotiate there, Wee like sepulchrall statues lay, All day, the same our postures were, And wee said nothing, all the day. If any, so by love refin'd, That he soules language understood, And by good love were growen all minde, Within convenient distance stood, He (though he knowes not which soule spake, Because both meant, both spake the same) Might thence a new concoction take, And part farre purer then he came. This Extasie doth unperplex (We said) and tell us what we love, Wee see by this, it was not sexe Wee see, we saw not what did move: But as all severall soules containe Mixture of things, they know not what, Love, these mixt soules, doth mixe againe, And makes both one, each this and that. A single violet transplant, The strength, the colour, and the size, (All which before was poore, and scant,) Redoubles still, and multiplies. When love, with one another so Interanimates two soules, That abler soule, which thence doth flow, Defects of lonelinesse controules. Wee then, who are this new soule, know, Of what we are compos'd, and made, For, th'Atomies of which we grow, Are soules, whom no change can invade. But O alas, so long, so farre Our bodies why doe wee forbeare? They are ours, though not wee, Wee are The intelligences, they the spheares. We owe them thankes, because they thus, Did us, to us, at first convay, Yeelded their senses force to us, Nor are drosse to us, but allay. On man heavens influence workes not so, But that it first imprints the ayre, For soule into the soule may flow, Though it to body first repaire. As our blood labours to beget Spirits, as like soules as it can, Because such fingers need to knit That subtile knot, which makes us man: So must pure lovers soules descend T'affections, and to faculties, Which sense may reach and apprehend, Else a great Prince in prison lies, To'our bodies turne wee then, that so Weake men on love reveal'd may looke; Loves mysteries in soules doe grow, But yet the body is his booke. And if some lover, such as wee, Have heard this dialogue of one, Let him still marke us, he shall see Small change, when we'are to bodies gone. Loves Deitie. I long to talke with some old lovers ghost, Who dyed before the god of Love was borne: I cannot thinke that hee, who then lov'd most, Sunke so low, as to love one which did scorne. But since this god produc'd a destinie, And that vice-nature, custome, lets it be; I must love her, that loves not mee. Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much: Nor he, in his young godhead practis'd it. But when an even flame two hearts did touch, His office was indulgently to fit Actives to passives. Correspondencie Only his subject was; It cannot bee Love, till I love her, that loves mee. But every moderne god will now extend His vast prerogative, as far as Jove. To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend, All is the purlewe of the God of Love. Oh were wee wak'ned by this Tyrannie To ungod this child againe, it could not beo I should love her, who loves not mee. Rebell and Atheist too, why murmure I, As though I felt the worst that love could doe? Love may make me leave loving, or might trie A deeper plague, to make her love mee too, Which since she loves before, I'am loth to see; Falshood is worse then hate; and that must bee, If shee whom I love, should love mee. Loves diet. To what a combersome unwieldinesse And burdenous corpulence my love had growne, But that I did, to make it lesse, And keepe it in proportion, Give it a diet, made it feed upon That which love worst endures, discretion. Above one sigh a day I'allow'd him not, Of which my fortune, and my faults had part; And if sometimes by stealth he got A she sigh from my mistresse heart, And thought to feast on that, I let him see 'Twas neither very sound, nor meant to mee; If he wroung from mee'a teare, I brin'd it so With scorne or shame, that him it nourish'd not; If he suck'd hers, I let him know 'Twas not a teare, which hee had got, His drinke was counterfeit, as was his meat; For, eyes which rowle towards all, weepe not, but sweat. What ever he would dictate, I writ that, But burnt my letters; When she writ to me, And that that favour made him fat, I said, if any title bee Convey'd by this, Ah, what doth it availe, To be the fortieth name in an entaile? Thus I redeem'd my buzard love, to flye At what, and when, and how, and where I chuse; Now negligent of sports I lye, And now as other Fawkners use, I spring a mistresse, sweare, write, sigh and weepe: And the game kill'd, or lost, goe talke, and sleepe. The Will. Before I sigh my last gaspe, let me breath, Great love, some Legacies; Here I bequeath Mine eyes to Argus, if mine eyes can see, If they be blinde, then Love, I give them thee; My tongue to Fame; to'Embassadours mine eares; To women or the sea, my teares; Thou, Love, hast taught mee heretofore By making mee serve her who'had twenty more, That I should give to none, but such, as had too much before. My constancie I to the planets give, My truth to them, who at the Court doe live; Mine ingenuity and opennesse, To Jesuites; to Buffones my pensivenesse; My silence to'any, who abroad hath beene; My mony to a Capuchin. Thou Love taught'st me, by appointing mee To love there, where no love receiv'd can be, Onely to give to such as have an incapacitie. My faith I give to Roman Catholiques; All my good works unto the Schismaticks Of Amsterdam; my best civility And Courtship, to an Universitie; My modesty I give to souldiers bare; My patience let gamesters share. Thou Love taughtst mee, by making mee Love her that holds my love disparity, Onely to give to those that count my gifts indignity. I give my reputation to those Which were my friends; Mine industrie to foes; To Schoolemen I bequeath my doubtfulnesse; My sicknesse to Physitians, or excesse; To Nature, all that I in Ryme have writ; And to my company my wit; Thou love, by making mee adore Her, who begot this love in mee before, Taughtst me to make, as though I gave, when I did but restore. To him for whom the passing bell next tolls, I give my physick bookes; my writen rowles Of Morall counsels, I to Bedlam give; My brazen medals, unto them which live In want of bread; to them which passe among All forrainers, mine English tongue. Thou, Love, by making mee love one Who thinkes her friendship a fit portion For yonger lovers, dost my gifts thus disproportion. Therefore I'll give no more; But I'll undoe The world by dying; because love dies too. Then all your beauties will bee no more worth Then gold in Mines, where none doth draw it forth. And all your graces no more use shall have Then a Sun dyall in a grave, Thou Love taughtst mee, by making mee Love her, who doth neglect both mee and thee, To'invent, and practise this one way, to'annihilate all three. The Funerall. Who ever comes to shroud me, do not harme Nor question much That subtile wreath of haire, which crowne, my arme; The mystery, the signe you must not touch, For'tis my outward Soule Viceroy to that, which unto heaven being gone, Will leave this to controule, And keepe these limbes, her Provinces, from dissolution. For if the sinewie thread my braine lets fall Through every part, Can tye those parts, and make mee one of all; Those haires which upward grew, and strength and art Have from a better braine, Can better do'it; except she meant that I By this should know my pain, As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condem'nd to die. What ere shee meant by'it, bury it by me, For since I am Loves martyr, it might breed idolatrie, If into others hands these reliques came; As 'twas humility To afford to it all that a Soule can doe, So, 'tis some bravery, That since you would have none of mee, I bury some of you. The Blossome. Little think'st thou, poore flower, Whom I have watch'd sixe or seaven dayes, And seene thy birth, and seene what every houre Gave to thy growth, thee to this height to raise, And now dost laugh and triumph on this bough, Little think'st thou That it will freeze anon, and that I shall To morrow finde thee falne, or not at all. Little think'st thou poore heart That labours yet to nestle thee, And think'st by hovering here to get a part In a forbidden or forbidding tree, And hop'st her stiffenesse by long siege to bow: Little think'st thou, That thou to morrow, ere that Sunne doth wake, Must with this Sunne, and mee a journey take. But thou which lov'st to bee Subtile to plague thy selfe, wilt say, Alas, if you must goe, what's that to mee? Here lyes my businesse, and here I will stay: You goe to friends, whose love and meanes present Various content To your eyes, eares, and tast, and every part. If then your body goe, what need your heart? Well then, stay here; but know, When thou hast stayd and done thy most; A naked thinking heart, that makes no show, Is to a woman, but a kinde of Ghost; How shall shee know my heart; or having none, Know thee for one? Practise may make her know some other part, But take my word, shee doth not know a Heart. Meet mee at London, then, Twenty dayes hence, and thou shalt see Mee fresher, and more fat, by being with men, Then if I had staid still with her and thee. For Gods sake, if you can, be you so too: I will give you There, to another friend, whom wee shall finde As glad to have my body, as my minde. The Primrose. Vpon this Primrose hill, Where, it Heav'n would distill A shoure of raine, each severall drop might goe To his owne primrose, and grow Manna so; And where their forme, and their infinitie Make a terrestriall Galaxie, As the small starres doe in the skie: I walke to finde a true Love; and I see That 'tis not a mere woman, that is shee, But must, or more, or lesse then woman bee. Yet know I not, which flower I wish; a sixe, or foure; For should my true-Love lesse then woman bee, She were scarce any thing; and then should shee Be more then woman, shee would get above All thought of sexe, and thinke to move My heart to study her, and not to love; Both these were monsters; Since there must reside Falshood in woman, I could more abide, She were by art, then Nature falsify'd. Live Primrose then, and thrive With thy true number five; And women, whom this flower doth represent, With this mysterious number be content; Ten is the farthest number, if halfe ten Belongs unto each woman, then Each woman may take halfe us men, Or if this will not serve their turne, Since all Numbers are odde, or even, and they fall First into this five, women may take us all. The Relique. When my grave is broke up againe Some second ghest to entertaine, (For graves have learn'd that woman-head To be to more then one a Bed) And he that digs it, spies A bracelet of bright haire about the bone, Will he not let'us alone, And thinke that there a loving couple lies, Who thought that this device might be some way To make their soules, at the last busie day, Meet at this grave, and make a little stay? If this fall in a time, or land, Where mis-devotion doth command, Then, he that digges us up, will bring Us, to the Bishop, and the King, To make us Reliques; then Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I A something else thereby; All women shall adore us, and some men; And since at such time, miracles are sought, I would have that age by this paper taught What miracles wee harmelesee lovers wrought. First, we lov'd well and faithfully, Yet knew not what wee lov'd, nor why, Difference of sex no more wee knew, Then our Guardian Angells doe, Comming and going, wee, Perchance might kisse, but not between those meales Our hands ne'r toucht the seales, Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free, These miracles wee did; but now alas, All measure, and all language, I should passe, Should I tell what a miracle shee was. The Dampe. When I am dead, and Doctors know not why, And my friends curiositie Will have me cut up to survay each part, When they shall finde your Picture in my heart, You thinke a sodaine dampe of love Will through all their senses move, And worke on them as mee, and so preferre Your murder, to the name of Massacre. Poore victories; But if you dare be brave, And pleasure in your conquest have, First kill th'enormous Gyant, your Disdaine, And let th'enchantresse Honor, next be slaine, And like a Goth and Vandall rize, Deface Records, and Histories Of your owne arts and triumphs over men, And without such advantage kill me then. For I could muster up as well as you My Gyants, and my Witches too, Which are vast Constancy, and Secretnesse, But these I neyther looke for, nor professe, Kill mee as Woman, let mee die As a meere man; doe you but try Your passive valor, and you shall finde than, In that you'have odds enough of any man. The Dissolution. Shee' is dead; And all which die To their first Elements resolve; And wee were mutuall Elements to us, And made of one another. My body then doth hers involve, And those things whereof I consist, hereby In me abundant grow, and burdenous, And nourish not, but smother. My fire of Passion, sighes of ayre, Water of teares, and earthly sad despaire, Which my materialls bee, But ne'r worne out by loves securitie, Shee, to my losse, doth by her death repaire, And I might live long wretched so But that my fire doth with my fuell grow. Now as those Active Kings Whose foraine conquest treasure brings, Receive more, and spend more, and soonest breake: This (which I am amaz'd that I can speake) This death, hath with my store My use encreas'd. And so my soule more earnestly releas'd, Will outstrip hers; As bullets flowen before A latter bullet may o'rtake, the pouder being more. A Ieat Ring sent. Thou art not so black, as my heart, Nor halfe so brittle, as her heart, thou art; What would'st thou say? shall both our properties by thee bee spoke, Nothing more endlesse, nothing sooner broke? Marriage rings are not of this stuffe; Oh, why should ought lesse precious, or lesse tough Figure our loves? Except in thy name thou have bid it say I'am cheap, &amp; nought but fashion, fling me'away. Yet stay with mee since thou art come, Circle this fingers top, which did'st her thombe. Be justly proud, and gladly safe, that thou dost dwell with me, She that, Oh, broke her faith, would soon breake thee. Negative love. I never stoop'd so low, as they Which on an eye, cheeke, lip, can prey, Seldome to them, which soare no higher Then vertue or the minde to'admire, For sense, and understanding may Know, what gives fuell to their fire: My love, though silly, is more brave, For may I misse, when ere I crave, If I know yet, what I would have. If that be simply perfectest Which can by no way be exprest But Negatives, my love is so. To All, which all love, I say no. If any who deciphers best, What we know not, our selves, can know, Let him teach mee that nothing; This As yet my ease, and comfort is, Though I speed not, I cannot misse. The Prohibition. Take heed of loving mee, At least remember, I forbade it thee; Not that I shall repaire my'unthrifty wast Of Breath and Blood, upon thy sighes, and teares, By being to mee then that which thou wast; But, so great Joy, our life at once outweares, Then, least thy love, by my death, frustrate bee, If thou love mee, take heed of loving mee. Take heed of hating mee, Or too much triumph in the Victorie. Not that I shall be mine owne officer, And hate with hate againe retaliate; But thou wilt lose the stile of conquerour, If I, thy conquest, perish by thy hate. Then, least my being nothing lessen thee, If thou hate mee, take heed of hating mee. Yet, love and hate mee too, So, these extreames shall ne'r their office doe; Love mee, that I may die the gentler way; Hate mee, because thy love is too great for mee; Or let these two, themselves, not me decay; So shall I live thy stay, not triumph bee; Lest thou thy love and hate and mee undoe To let mee live, Oh love and hate mee too. The Expiration. So, so, breake off this last lamenting kisse, Which sucks two soules, and vapors Both away, Turne thou ghost that way, and let mee turne this, And let our selves benight our happiest day, Wee aske none leave to love; nor will we owe Any, so cheape a death, as saying, Goe; Goe; and if that word have not quite kil'd thee, Ease mee with death, by bidding mee goe too. Oh, if it have, let my word worke on mee, And a just office on a murderer doe. Except it be too late, to kill me so, Being double dead, going, and bidding, goe. The Computation. For the first twenty yeares, since yesterday, I scarce beleev'd, thou could'st be gone away, For forty more, I fed on favours past, And forty'on hopes, that thou would'st, they might last. Teares drown'd one hundred, and sighes blew out two, A thousand, I did neither thinke, nor doe. Or not divide, all being one thought of you; Or in a thousand more, forgot that too. Yet call not this long life; But thinke that I Am, by being dead, Immortall; Can ghosts die? Elegie. [Death.] Language thou art too narrow, and too weake To ease us now; great sorrow cannot speake; If we could sigh out accents, and weepe words, Griefe weares, and lessens, that tears breath affords. Sad hearts, the lesse they seeme the more they are, (So guiltiest men stand mutest at the barre) Not that they know not, feele not their estate, But extreme sense hath made them desperate, Sorrow, to whom we owe all that we bee; Tyrant, in the fist and greatest Monarchy, Was't, that she did possesse all hearts before, Thou hast kil'd her, to make thy Empire more? Knew'st thou some would, that knew her not, lament, As in a deluge perish th'innocent? Was't not enough to have that palace wonne, But thou must raze it too, that was undone? Had'st thou staid there, and look'd out at her eyes, All had ador'd thee that now from thee flies, For they let out more light, then they tooke in, They told not when, but did the day beginne; She was too Saphirine, and cleare to thee; Clay, flint, and jeat now thy fit dwellings be; Alas, shee was too pure, but not too weake; Who e'r saw Christall Ordinance but would break? And if wee be thy conquest, by her fall Th'hast lost thy end, for in her perish all; Or if we live, we live but to rebell, They know her better now, that knew her well; If we should vapour out, and pine, and die; Since, shee first went, that were not miserie; Shee chang'd our world with hers; now she is gone, Mirth and prosperity is oppression; For of all morall vertues she was all, The Ethicks speake of vertues Cardinall; Her soule was Paradise; the Cherubin Set to keepe it was grace, that kept out sinne; Shee had no more then let in death, for wee All reape consumption from one fruitfull tree; God tooke her hence, left some of us should love Her, like that plant, him and his lawes above, And when wee teares, hee mercy shed in this, To raise our mindes to heaven where now she is; Who if her vertues would have let her stay Wee'had had a Saint, have now a holiday; Her heart was that strange bush, where, sacred fire, Religion, did not consume, but'inspire Such piety, so chast use of Gods day, That what we turne to feast, she turn'd to pray, And did prefigure here, in devout tast, The rest of her high Sabaoth, which shall last; Angels did hand her up, who next God dwell, (For she was of that order whence most fell) Her body left with us, left some had said, Shee could not die, except they saw her dead; For from lesse vertue, and lesse beautiousnesse, The Gentiles fram'd them Gods and Goddesses. The ravenous earth that now woes her to be, Earth too, will be a Lemnia; and the tree That wraps that christall in a wooden Tombe, Shall be tooke up spruce, fill'd with diamond; And we her sad glad friends all beare a part Of griefe, for all would waste a Stoicks heart. Elegie to the Lady Bedford. You that are she, and you that's double shee, In her dead face, halfe of your selfe shall see; Shee was the other part, for so they doe Which build them friendships, become one of two; So two, that but themselves no third can fit, Which were to be so, when they were not yet Twinnes, though their birth Cusco, and Musco take, As divers starres one Constellation make, Pair'd like two eyes, have equall motion, so Both but one meanes to see, one way to goe; Had you dy'd first, a carcasse shee had beene; And wee your rich Tombe in her face had seene; She like the Soule is gone, and you here stay Not a live friend; but thother halfe of clay; And since you act that part, As men say, here Lies such a Prince, when but one part is there; And do all honour: and devotion due; Unto the whole, so wee all reverence you; For, such a friendship who would not adore In you, who are all what both was before, Not all, as if some perished by this, But so, as all in you contracted is; As of this all, though many parts decay, The pure which elemented them shall stay; And though diffus'd, and spread in infinite, Shall recollect, and in one All unite: So madame, as her Soule to heaven is fled, Her flesh rests in the earth, as in the bed; Her vertues do, as to their proper spheare, Returne to dwell with you, of whom they were; As perfect motions are all circular, So they to you, their sea, whence lesse streames are; Shee was all spices, you all metalls; so In you two wee did both rich Indies know; And as no fire, nor rust can spend or waste One dramme of gold, but what was first shall last, Though it bee forc'd in water, earth, salt, aire, Expans'd in infinite, none will impaire; So, to your selfe you may additions take, But nothing can you lesse, or changed make. Seeke not in seeking new, to seeme to doubt, That you can can match her, or not be without; But let some faithfull booke in her roome be, Yet but of Iudith no such booke as shee. Elegie. [The Expostulation.] To make the doubt cleare, that no woman's true, Was it my fate to prove it strong in you? Thought I, but one had breathed purest aire, And must she needs be false because she's faire? Is it your beauties marke, or of your youth, Or your perfection, not to study truth? Or thinke you heaven is deafe, or hath no eyes? Or those it hath, smile at your perjuries? Are vowes so cheape with women, or the matter Whereof they are made, that they are writ in water, And blowne away with winde? Or doth their breath (Both hot and cold) at once make life and death? Who could have thought so many accents sweet Form'd into words, so many sighs should meete As from our hearts, so many oathes, and teares Sprinkled among, (all sweeter by our feares And the divine impression of stolne kisses, That seal'd the rest) should now prove empty blisses? Did you draw bonds to forfet? signe to breake? Or must we reade you quite from what you speake, And finde the truth out the wrong way? or must Hee first desire you false, would wish you just? O I prophane, though most of women be This kinde of beast, my thought shall except thee; My dearest Love, though froward jealousie, With circumstance might urge thy'inconstancie, Sooner I'll thinke the Sunne will cease to cheare The teeming earth, and that forget to beare, Sooner that rivers will runne back, or Thames With ribs of Ice in June would bind his streames; Or Nature, by whose strength the world endures, Would change her course, before you alter yours; But O that treacherous breast to whom weake you Did trust our Counsells, and wee both may rue, Having his falshood found too late, 'twas hee That made me cast you guilty, and you me, Whilst he, black wrech, betray'd each simple word Wee spake, unto the cunning of a third; Curst may hee be, that so our love hath slaine, And wander on the earth, wretched as Cain, Wretched as hee, and not deserve least pitty; In plaguing him, let misery be witty; Let all eyes shunne him, and hee shunne each eye, Till hee be noysome as his infamie; May he without remorse deny God thrice, And not be trusted more on his Soules price; And after all selfe torment, when hee dyes, May Wolves teare out his heart, Vultures his eyes, Swine eate his bowels, and his falser tongue That utter'd all, be to some Raven flung, And let his carrion coarse be a longer feast To the Kings dogges; then any other beast; Now have I curst, let us our love revive; In mee the flame was never more alive; I could beginne againe to court and praise, And in that pleasure lengthen the short dayes Of my lifes lease; like Painters that do take Delight, not in made worke, but whiles they make; I could renew those times, when first I saw Love in your eyes, that gave my tongue the law To like what you lik'd; and at maskes and playes Commend the selfe same Actors, the same wayes; Aske how you did, and often with intent Of being officious, be impertinent; All which were such soft pastimes, as in these Love was as subtilly catch'd, as a disease; But being got it is a treasure sweet, Which to defend is harder then to get: And ought not be prophan'd on either part, For though'tis got by chance, 'tis kept by art. [[The Paradox.]] No Lover saith, I love, nor any other Can judge a perfect Lover; Hee thinkes that else none can or will agree, That any loves but hee: I cannot say I lov'd, for who can say Hee was kill'd yesterday. Love with excesse of heat, more yong then old, Death kills with too much cold; Wee dye but once, and who lov'd last did die, Hee that saith twice, doth lye: For though hee seeme to move, and stirre a while, It doth the sense beguile. Such life is like the light which bideth yet When the lifes light is set, Or like the heat, which, fire in solid matter Leaves behinde, two houres after. Once I love and dyed; and am now become Mine Epitaph and Tombe. Here dead men speake their last, and so do I; Love-slaine, loe, here I dye. A Hymne to Christ, at the Authors last going into Germany. In what torne ship soever I embarke, That ship shall be my embleme of thy Arke; What sea soever swallow mee, that flood Shall be to mee an embleme of thy blood; Though thou with clouds of anger do disguise Thy face; yet through that maske I know those eyes, Which, though they turne away sometimes, They never will despise. I sacrifice this Hand unto thee, And all whom I lov'd there, and who lov'd mee; When I have put our seas twixt them and mee, Put thou thy seas betwixt my sinnes and thee. As the trees sap doth seeke the root below In winter, in my winter now I goe, Where none but thee, th'Eternall root Of true Love I may know. Nor thou nor thy religion dost controule, The amorousnesse of an harmonious Soule, But thou would'st have that love thy selfe: As thou Art jealous, Lord, so I am jealous now, Thou lov'st not, till from loving more, thou free My soule: Who ever gives, takes libertie: O, if thou car'st not whom I love Alas, thou lov'st not mee. Seale then this bill of my Divorce to All, On whom those fainter beames of love did fall; Marry those loves, which in youth scattered bee On Fame, Wit, Hopes (false mistresses) to thee. Churches are best for Prayer, that have least light: To see God only, I goe out of sight: And to scape stormy dayes, I chuse An Everlasting night. The Lamentations of Ieremy, for the most part according to Tremelius. Chap. I. 1 How sits this citie, late most populous, Thus solitary, and like a widdow thus? Amplest of Nations, Queene of Provinces She was, who now thus tributary is? 2Still in the night shee weepes, and her teares fall Downe by her cheekes along, and none of all Her lovers comfort her; Perfidiously Her friends have dealt, and now are enemie. 3Unto great bondage, and afflictions Juda is captive led; Those nations With whom shee dwells, no place of rest afford, In streights shee meets her Persecutors sword. 4Emptie are the gates of Sion, and her waies Mourne, because none come to her solemne dayes. Her Priests doe groane, her maides are comfortlesse, And shee's unto her selfe a bitternesse. 5Her foes are growne her head, and live at Peace, Because when her transgressions did increase, The Lord strooke her with sadnesse: Th'enemie Doth drive her children to captivitie. 6From Sions daughter is all beauty gone, Like Harts, which seeke for Pasture, and find none, Her Princes are, and now before the foe Which still pursues them, without strength they go. 7Now in their daies of Teares, Jerusalem (Her men slaine by the foe, none succouring them) Remembers what of old, shee esteemed most, Whiles her foes laugh at her, for what she hath lost. 8Jerusalem hath sinn'd, therefore is shee Remov'd, as women in uncleannesse bee; Who honor'd, scorne her, for her foulnesse they Have seene, her selfe doth groane, and turne away. 9Her foulnesse in her skirts was seene, yet she Remembred not her end; Miraculously Therefore shee fell, none comforting: Behold O Lord my affliction, for the Foe growes bold. 10Upon all things where her delight hath beene, The foe hath stretch'd his hand, for shee hath seene Heathen, whom thou command'st, should not doe so, Into her holy Sanctuary goe. 11And all her people groane, and seeke for bread; And they have given, only to be fed, All precious things, wherein their pleasure lay: How cheape I'am growne, O Lord, behold, and weigh. 12All this concernes not you, who passe by mee, O see, and marke if any sorrow bee Like to my sorrow, which Jehova hath Done to mee in the day of his fierce wrath? 13That fire, which by himselfe is governed He hath cast from heaven on my bones, and spred A net before my feet, and mee o'rthrowne, And made me languish all the day alone. 14His hand hath of my sinnes framed a yoake Which wreath'd, and cast upon my neck, hath broke My strength. The Lord unto those enemies Hath given mee, from whence I cannot rise. 15He underfoot hath troden in my sight My strong men; He did company invite To breake my young men, he the winepresse hath Trod upon Juda's daughter in his wrath. 16For these things doe I weepe, mine eye, mine eye Casts water out; For he which should be nigh To comfort mee, is now departed farre, The foe prevailes, forlorne my children are. 17There's none, though Sion do stretch out her hand To comfort her, it is the Lords command That Iacobs foes girt him. Ierusalem Is as an uncleane woman amongst them. 18But yet the Lord is just, and righteous still, I have rebell'd against his holy will; O heare all people, and my sorrow see, My maides, my young men in captivitie. 19I called for my lovers then, but they Deceiv'd mee, and my Priests, and Elders lay Dead in the citie; for they sought for meat Which should refresh their soules, they could not get. 20Because I am in streights, Iehova see My heart return'd, my bowells muddy bee, Because I have rebell'd so much, as fast The sword without, as death within, doth wast. 21Of all which heare I mourne, none comforts mee, My foes have heard my griefe, and glad they be, That thou hast done it; But thy promis'd day Will come, when, as I suffer, so shall they. 22Let all their wickednesse appeare to thee, Doe unto them, as thou hast done to mee, For all my sinnes: The sighs which I have had Are very many, and my heart is sad. Chap. II. 1 How over Sions daughter hath God hung His wraths thicke cloud? and from heaven hath flung, To earth the beauty of Israel, and hath Forgot his foot-stoole in the day of wrath? 2The Lord unsparingly hath swallowed All Jacobs dwellings, and demolished To ground the strengths of Iuda, and prophan'd The Princes of the Kingdome, and the land. 3In heat of wrath, the horne of Israel hee Hath cleane cut off, and lest the enemie Be hindred, his right hand he doth retire, But is towards Iacob, All-devouring fire. 4Like to an enemie he bent his bow, His right hand was in posture of a foe, To kill what Sions daughter did desire, 'Gainst whom his wrath, he poured forth, like fire. 5For like an enemie Iehova is, Devouring Israel, and his Palaces, Destroying holds, giving additions To Iuda's daughters lamentations. 6Like to a garden hedge he hath cast downe The place where was his congregation, And Sions feasts and sabbaths are forgot; Her King, her Priest, his wrath regardeth not. 7The Lord forsakes his Altar, and detests His Sanctuary, and in the foes hands rests Palace, and the walls, in which their cries Are heard, as in the true solemnities. 8The Lord hath cast a line, so to confound And levell Sions walls unto the ground, He drawes not back his hand; which doth oreturne The wall, and Rampart, which together mourne. 9Their gates are sunke into the ground, and hee Hath broke the barre; their King and Princes bee Amongst the heathen, without law, nor there Unto their Prophets doth the Lord appeare. 10There Sions Elders on the ground are plac'd, And silence keepe; Dust on their heads they cast, In sack cloth have they girt themselves, and low The Virgins towards ground, their heads do throw. 11My bowells are growne muddy, and mine eyes Are faint with weeping: and my liver lies Pour'd out upon the ground, for miserie That sucking children in the streets doe die. 12When they had cryed unto their Mothers, where Shall we have bread, and drinke? they fainted there And in the street like wounded persons lay Till 'twixt their mothers breasts they went away. 13 Daughter Ierusalem, Oh what may bee A witnesse, or comparison for thee? Sion, to ease thee, what shall I name like thee? Thy breach is like the sea, what help can bee? 14For, the vaine foolish things thy Prophets sought, Thee, thine iniquities they have not taught, Which might disturne thy bondage: but for thee False burthens, and false causes they would see. 15The passengers doe clap their hands, and hisse And wag their head at thee, and say, Is this That citie, which so many men did call Joy of the earth, and perfectest of all? 16Thy foes doe gape upon thee, and they hisse, And gnash their teeth, and say, Devoure wee this, For this is certainly the day which wee Expected, and which now we finde, and see. 17The Lord hath done that which he purposed, Fulfill'd his word of old determined; He hath throwne downe, and not spar'd, and thy foe Made glad above thee, and advanc'd him so. 18But now, their hearts against the Lord do call, Therefore, O walls of Sion, let teares fall Downe like a river, day and night; take thee No rest, but let thine eye incessant be. 19Arise, cry in the night, poure, for thy sinnes, Thy heart, like water, when the watch begins; Lift up thy hands to God, lest children dye, Which, faint for hunger, in the streets doe lye. 20Behold O Lord, consider unto whom Thou hast done this; what, shall the women come To eate their children of a spanne? shall thy Prophet and Priest be slaine in Sanctuary? 21On ground in streets, the yong and old do lye, My virgins and yong men by sword do dye; Them in the day of thy wrath thou hast slaine, Nothing did thee from killing them containe. 22As to a solemne feast, all whom I fear'd Thou call'st about mee; when his wrath appear'd, None did remaine or scape, for those which I Brought up, did perish by mine enemie. Chap. III. 1 I am the man which have affliction seene, Under the rod of Gods wrath having beene, 2He hath led mee to darknesse, not to light, 3And against mee all day, his hand doth fight. 4Hee hath broke my bones, worne out my flesh and skinne, 5Built up against mee; and hath girt mee in With hemlocke, and with labour; 6. and set mee In darke, as they who dead for ever bee. 7Hee hath hedg'd me lest I scape, and added more To my steele fetters, heavier then before, When I crie out, he out shuts my prayer: 9 And hath Stop'd with hewn stone my way, &amp; turn'd my path. 10And like a Lion hid in secrecie, Or Beare which lyes in wait, he was to mee, 11He stops my way, teares me, made desolate, 12And hee makes mee the marke he shooteth at. 13Hee made the children of his quiver passe Into my reines, 14 I with my people was All the day long, a song and mockery. 15Hee hath fill'd mee with bitternesse, and he Hath made me drunke with wormewood. 16 He hath burst My teeth with stones, and covered mee with dust; 17And thus my Soule farre off from peace was set, And my prosperity I did forget. 18My strength, my hope (unto my selfe I said) Which from the Lord should come, is perished. 19But when my mournings I do thinke upon, My wormwood, hemlocke, and affliction, 20My Soule is humbled in remembring this; 21My heart considers, therefore, hope there is, 22'Tis Gods great mercy we'are not utterly Consum'd, for his compassions do not die; 23For every morning they renewed bee, For great, O Lord, is thy fidelity. 24The Lord is, saith my Soule, my portion, And therefore in him will I hope alone. 25The Lord is good to them, who on him relie, And to the Soule that seeks him earnestly. 26It is both good to trust, and to attend (The Lords salvation) unto the end: 27'Tis good for one his yoake in youth to beare; 28He fits alone, and doth all speech forbeare, Because he hath borne it. 29 And his mouth he layes Deepe in the dust, yet then in hope he stayes. 30He gives his cheekes to whosoever will Strike him, and so he is reproched still. 31For, not for ever doth the Lord forsake, 32But when he'hath strucke with sadnes, hee doth take Compassion, as his mercy'is infinite; 33Nor is it with his heart, that he doth smite, 34That underfoot the prisoners stamped bee, 35That a mans right the Judge himselfe doth see To be wrong from him. 36 That he subverted is In his just cause; the Lord allowes not this: 37Who then will say, that ought doth come to passe, But that which by the Lord commanded was? 38Both good and evill from his mouth proceeds; 39Why then grieves any man for his misdeeds? 40Turne wee to God, by trying out our wayes; 41To him in heaven, our hands with hearts upraise. 42Wee have rebell'd, and falne away from thee, Thou pardon'st not. 43 Usest no clemencie; Pursuest us, kill'st us, coverest us with wrath, 44Cover'st thy selfe with clouds, that our prayer hath No power to passe. 45 And thou hast made us fall As refuse, and off-scouring to them all. 46All our foes gape at us. 47, Feare and a snare With ruine, and with waste, upon us are. 48With water rivers doth mine eye oreflow For ruine of my peoples daughters so; 49Mine eye doth drop downe teares incessantly, 50Untill the Lord looke downe from heaven to see. 51And for my city daughters sake, mine eye Doth breake mine heart. 52 Causles mine enemy, Like a bird chac'd me. 53 In a dungeon They have shut my life, and cast me on a stone. 54Waters flow'd o'r my head, then thought I, I am Destroy'd; 55 I called Lord, upon thy name Out of the pit. 56 And thou my voice didst heare; Oh from my sigh, and crye, stop not thine eare. 57Then when I call'd upon thee, thou drew'st nere Unto mee, and said'st unto mee, do not feare. 58Thou Lord my Soules cause handled hast, and thou Rescuest my life. 59 O Lord do thou judge now, Thou heardst my wrong. 60 Their vengeance all they have wrought; 61How they reproach'd, thou hast heard, and what they thought, 62What their lips uttered, which against me rose, And what was ever whisper'd by my foes. 63I am their song, whether they rise or sit, 64Give them rewards Lord, for their working fit, 65Sorrow of heart, thy curse. 66 And with thy might Follow, and from under heaven destroy them quite. Cap. IV. 1 How is the gold become so dimme? How is Purest and finest gold thus chang'd to this? The stones which were stones of the Sanctuary, Scattered in corners of each street do lye. 2The pretious sonnes of Sion, which should bee Valued at purest gold, how do wee see Low rated now, as earthen Pitchers, stand, Which are the worke of a poore Potters hand. 3Even the Sea-calfes draw their brests, and give Sucke to their young; my peoples daughters live By reason of the foes great cruelnesse, As do the Owles in the vast Wildernesse. 4And when the sucking child doth strive to draw, His tongue for thirst cleaves to his upper jaw. And when for bread the little children crye, There is no man that doth them satisfie. 5They which before were delicately fed, Now in the streets forlorne have perished, And they which ever were in scarlet cloath'd, Sit and embrace the dunghills which they loath'd. 6The daughters of my people have sinned more, Then did the towne of Sodome sinne before; Which being at once destroy'd, there did remaine No hands amongst them, to vexe them againe. 7But heretofore purer her Nazarite Was then the snow, and milke was not so white; As carbuncles did their pure bodies shine, And all their polish'dnesse was Seraphine. 8They are darker now then blacknes, none can know Them by the face, as through the street they goe, For now their skin doth cleave unto their bone, And withered, is like to dry wood growne. 9Better by sword then famine 'tis to dye; And better through pierc'd, then by penury, 10Women by nature pitifull, have eate Their children drest with their owne hand for meat. 11 Iehova here fully accomplish'd hath His indignation, and powr'd forth his wrath, Kindled a fire in Sion, which hath power To eate, and her foundations to devour. 12Nor would the Kings of the earth, nor all which live In the inhabitable world beleeve, That any adversary, any foe Into Ierusalem should enter so; 13For the Priests sins, and Prophets, which have shed Blood in the streets, and the just murthered: 14Which when those men, whom they made blinde, did stray Thorough the streets, defiled by the way With blood, the which impossible it was Their garments should scape touching, as they passe, 15Would cry aloud, depart defiled men, Depart, depart, and touch us not, and then They fled, and strayd, and with the Gentiles were, Yet told their friends, they should not long dwell; there, 16For this they are scattered by Jehovahs face VVho never will regard them more; No grace Unto their old men shall the foe afford, Nor, that they are Priests, redeeme them from the sword. 17And wee as yet, for all these miseries Desiring our vaine helpe, consume our eyes: And such a nation as cannot save, VVe in desire and speculation have. 18They hunt our steps, that in the streets wee feare To goe: our end is now approached neere, Our dayes accomplish'd are, this the last day, Eagles of heaven are not so swift as they 19VVhich follow us, o'r mountaine tops they flye At us, and for us in the desart lye. 20The annointed Lord, breath of our nostrils, hee Of whom we said, under his shadow, wee Shall with more ease under the Heathen dwell, Into the pit which these men digged, fell 21Rejoyce O Edoms daughter, joyfull bee Thou which inhabitst her, for unto thee This cup shall passe, and thou with drunkennesse Shalt fill thy selfe, and shew thy nakednesse. 22And then thy sinnes O Sion, shall be spent, The Lord will not leave thee in banishment. Thy sinnes O Edoms daughter, hee will see, And for them, pay thee with captivitie. Cap. V. 1 Remember, O Lord, what is fallen on us See, and marke how we are reproached thus, 2For unto strangers our possession Is turn'd, our houses unto Aliens gone, 3Our mothers are become as widowes, wee As Orphans all, and without fathers be; 4Waters which are our owne, wee drunke, and pay, And upon our owne wood a price they lay, 5Our persecutors on our necks do sit, They make us travaile, and not intermit, 6We stretch our hands unto th'Egyptians To get us bread; and to the Assyrians. 7Our Fathers did these sinnes, and are no more, But wee do beare the sinnes they did before. 8They are but servants, which do rule us thus, Yet from their hands none would deliver us. 9With danger of our life our bread wee gat; For in the wildernesse, the sword did wait. 10The tempests of this famine wee liv'd in, Black as an Ocean colour'd had our kinne: 11In Iudaes cities they the maids abus'd By force, and so women in Sion us'd. 12The Princes with their hands they hung; no grace Nor honour gave they to the Elders face. 13Unto the mill our yong men carried are, And children fell under the wood they bare. 14Elders, the gates; youth did their songs forbeare, Gone was our joy; our dancings, mournings were. 15Now is the crowne falne from our head; and woe Be unto us, because we'have sinned so. 16For this our hearts do languish, and for this Over our eyes a cloudy dimnesse is. 17Because mount Sion desolate doth lye, And foxes there do goe at libertie: 18But thou O Lord art ever, and thy throne From generation, to generation. 19Why should'st thou forget us eternally? Or leave us thus long in this misery? 20Restore us Lord to thee, that so we may Returne, and as of old, renew our day. 21For oughtest thou, O Lord, despise us thus 22And to be utterly enrag'd at us? SATYRES. Satyre I. [Away thou fondling motley humorist] Away thou fondling motley humorist, Leave mee, and in this standing woodden chest, Consorted with these few bookes, let me lye In prison, and here be coffin'd, when I dye; Here are Gods conduits; grave Divines, and here Natures Secretary, the Philosopher. And jolly Statesmen, which teach how to tie The sinewes of a cities mistique bodie; Here gathering Chroniclers, and by them stand Giddie fantastique Poëts of each land. Shall I leave all this constant company, And follow headlong, wild uncertaine thee? First sweare by thy best love in earnest (If thou which lov'st all, canst love any best) Thou wilt not leave mee in the middle street, Though some more spruce companion thou dost meet, Not though a Captaine do come in thy way Bright parcell gilt, with forty dead mens pay, Not though a briske perfum'd piert Courtier Deigne with a nod, thy courtesie to answer. Nor come a velvet Justice with a long Great traine of blew coats, twelve, or fourteen strong, Wilt thou grin or fawne on him, or prepare A speech to Court his beautious sonne and heire? For better or worse take mee, or leave mee: To take, and leave mee is adultery. Oh monstrous, superstitious puritan, Of refin'd manners, yet ceremoniall man, That when thou meet'st one, with enquiring eyes; Dost search, and like a needy broker prize The silke, and gold he weares, and to that rate So high or low, dost raise thy formall hate: That wilt consort none, untill thou have knowne What lands hee hath in hope, or of his owne, As though all thy companions should make thee Jointures, and marry thy deare company. Why should'st thou that dost not onely approve, But in ranke itchie lust, desire, and love The nakednesse and barrennesse to enjoy, of thy plumpe muddy whore, or prostitute boy Hate vertue, though shee be naked, and bare, At birth, and death, our bodies naked are; And till our Soules be unapparrelled Of bodies, they from blisse are banished. Mans first blest state was naked, when by sinne Hee lost that, yet hee was cloath'd but in beasts skin, And in this course attire, which I now weare With God, and with the Muses I conferre. But since thou like a contrite penitent, Charitably warm'd of thy sinnes, dost repent These vanities, and giddinesses, loe I shut my chamber doore, and come, lets goe, But sooner may a cheape whore, who hath beene Worne by as many severall men in sinne, As are black feathers, or musk-colour hose, Name her childs right true father, 'mongst all those: Sooner may one guesse, who shall beare away The infant of London, Heire to an India, And sooner may a gulling weather Spie By drawing forth heavens Sceanes tell certainly What fashioned hats, or ruffes, or suits next yeare Our subtile wittied antique youths will weare; Then thou, when thou depart'st from mee, can show Whither, why, when, or with whom thou wouldst go. But how shall I be pardon'd my offence That thus have sinn'd against my conscience. Now we are in the street; He first of all Improvidently proud, creepes to the wall, And so imprisoned, and hem'd in by mee Sells for a little state high libertie, Yet though he cannot skip forth now to greet Every fine silken painted foole we meet, He then to him with amorous smiles allures, And grins, smacks, shrugs, and such an itch endures, As prentises, or schoole-boyes which doe know Of some gay sport abroad, yet dare not goe. And as fidlers stop lowest, at highest sound, So to the most brave, stoopt hee nigh'st the ground. But to a grave man, he doth move no more Then the wise politique horse would heretofore, Now leaps he upright, Joggs me, &amp; cryes, Do you see Yonder well favoured youth; Which? Oh, 'tis hee That dances so divinely; Oh, said I, Stand still, must you dance here for company? Hee droopt, wee went, till one (which did excell Th'Indians, in drinking his Tobacco well) Met us, they talk'd; I whispered, let us goe, 'T may be you smell him not, truely I doe; He heares not mee, but, on the other side A many-coloured Peacock having spide, Leaves him and mee; I for my lost sheep stay; He followes, overtakes, goes on the way, Saying, him whom I last left, s'all repute For his device, in hansoming a sute, To judge of lace, pinke, panes, print, cut, and plight, Of all the Court, to have the best conceit; Our dull Comedians want him, let him goe; But Oh, God strengthen thee, why stoop'st thou so? Why, he hath travailed long? no, but to me Which understand none, he doth seeme to be Perfect French, and Italian; I replyed, So is the Poxe; He answered not, but spy'd More men of sort, of parts, and qualities; At last his Love he in a windowe spies, And like light dew exhal'd, he flings from mee Violently ravish'd to his liberty; Many were there, he could command no more; Hee quarrell'd, fought, bled; and turn'd out of dore Directly came to mee hanging the head, And constantly a while must keepe his bed. Satyre II. [Sir; though (I thanke God for it) I do hate] Sir; though (I thanke God for it) I do hate Perfectly all this towne, yet there's one state In all ill things so excellently best, That hate, toward them, breeds pitty towards the rest; Though Poëtry indeed be such a sinne As I thinke that brings dearth, and Spaniards in, Though like the Pestilence and old fashion'd love, Ridlingly it catch men; and doth remove Never, till it be sterv'd out; yet their state Is poore, disarm'd, like Papists, not worth hate: One, (like a wretch, which at Barre judg'd as dead, Yet prompts him which stands next, and cannot reade, And saves his life) gives ideot actors meanes (Starving himselfe) to live by his labor'd sceanes. As in some Organ, Puppits dance above And bellows pant below, which th? do move. One would move Love by rithmes; but witchchrafts charms Bring not now their old feares, nor their old harmes. Rammes, and slings now are seely battery, Pistolets are the best Artillerie. And they who write to Lords, rewards to get, Are they not like singers at doores for meat? And they who write, because all write, have still That excuse for writing, and for writing ill; But hee is worst, who (beggarly) doth chaw Others wits fruits, and in his ravenous maw Rankly digested, doth those things out-spue, As his owne things; and they are his owne, 'tis true, For if one eate my meate, though it be knowne The meate was mine, th'excrement is his owne: But these do mee no harme, nor they which use To out-doe [Dildoes]This word was censored in the 1633 edition and is added here from the 1635 edition., and out-usure Jewes; To out-drinke the sea, to out-sweare the [Litany];This word was censored in the 1633 edition, but also omitted in the 1635 edition.

But these punish themselves; the insolence Of Coscus onely breeds my just offence, Whom time (which rots all, and makes botches poxe, And plodding on, must make a calfe an oxe) Hath made a Lawyer; which was alas of late But scarce a Poët, jollier of this state, Then are new benefic'd ministers, he throwes Like nets, or lime-twigs, wheresoever he goes, His title of Barrister, on every wench, And wooes in language of the Pleas, and Bench: A motion, Lady, Speake Coscus; I have beene In love, ever since tricesimo of the Queene, Continuall claimes I have made, injunctions got To stay my rivals suit, that hee should not Proceed, spare mee; In Hillary terme I went, You said, If I Returne next size in Lent, I should be in remitter of your grace; In th'interim my letters should take place Of affidavits: words, words, which would teare The tender labyrinth of a soft maids eare.

For as a thrifty wench scrapes kitching-stuffe, And barrelling the droppings, and the snuffe, Of wasting candles, which in thirty yeare (Reliquely kept) perchance buyes wedding geare; Peecemeale he gets lands, and spends as much time Wringing each Acre, as men pulling prime. In parchment then, large as his fields, hee drawes Assurances, bigge, as gloss'd civill lawes, So huge, that men (in our times forwardnesse) Are Fathers of the Church for writing lesse. These hee writes not; nor for these written payes, Therefore spares no length; as in those first dayes When Luther was profest, He did desire Short Pater nosters, saying as a Fryer Each day his beads, but having left those lawes, Addes to Christs prayer, the Power and glory clause. But when he sells or changes land, he'impaires His writings, and (unwatch'd) leaves out, ses heires As slily as any Commenter goes by, Hard words, or sense; or in Divinity As controverters, in vouch'd Texts, leave out Shrewd words, which might against them cleare the doubt: Where are those spred woods which cloth'd hertofore Those bought lands? not built, nor burnt within dore.

Is not our Mistresse faire Religion, As worthy of all our Soules devotion, As vertue was in the first blinded age? Are not heavens joyes as valiant to asswage Lusts, as earths honour was to them? Alas, As wee do them in meanes, shall they surpasse Us in the end, and shall thy fathers spirit Meete blinde Philosophers in heaven, whose merit Of strict life may be imputed faith, and heare Thee, whom hee taught so easie wayes and neare To follow, damn'd? O if thou dar'st, feare this. This feare great courage, and high valour is; Dar'st thou ayd mutinous Dutch, and dar'st thou lay Thee in ships woodden Sepulchers, a prey To leaders rage, to stormes, to shot, to dearth? Dar'st thou dive seas, and dungeons of the earth? Hast thou couragious fire to thaw the ice Of frozen North discoueries, and thrise Colder then Salamanders? like divine Children in th'oven, fires of Spaine, and the line, Whose countries limbecks to our bodies bee, Canst thou for gaine beare? and must every hee Which cryes not, Goddesse, to thy Mistresse, draw, Or eate thy poysonous words, courage of straw!

Know thy foe, the foule devill h'is, whom thou Strivest to please: for hate, not love, would allow Thee faine, his whole Realme to be quit; and as The worlds all parts wither away and passe, So the worlds selfe, thy other lov'd foe, is In her decrepit wayne, and thou loving this, Dost love a withered and worne strumpet; last, Flesh (it selfe death) and joyes which flesh can taste, Thou lovest; and thy faire goodly soule, which doth Give this flesh power to taste joy, thou dost loath; Seeke true religion, O where? Mirreus Thinking her unhous'd her, and fled from us, Seekes her at Rome, there, because hee doth know That shee was there a thousand yeares agoe, He loves the ragges so, as wee here obey The statecloth where the Prince sate yesterday. Crants to such brave Loves will not be inthrall'd, But loves her onely, who at Geneva is call'd Religion, plaine, simple, sullen, yong, Contemptuous, yet unhansome. As among Lecherous humors, there is one that judges No wenches wholsome, but course country drudges: Graius stayes still at home here, and because Some Preachers, vile ambitious bauds, and lawes Still new like fashions, bids him thinke that shee Which dwels with us, is onely perfect, hee Imbraceth her, whom his Godfathers will Tender to him, being tender, as Wards still Take such wives as their Guardians offer, or Pay valewes. Carelesse Phrygius doth abhorre All, because all cannot be good, as one Knowing some women whores, dares marry none. Graccus loves all as one, and thinkes that so As women do in divers countries goe In divers habits, yet are still one kinde; So doth, so is Religion; and this blind- nesse too much light breeds; but unmoved thou Of force must one, and forc'd but one allow; And the right; aske thy father which is shee, Let him aske his; though truth and falshood bee Neare twins, yet truth a little elder is; Be busie to seeke her, beleeve mee this, Hee's not of none, nor worst, that seekes the best. To adore, or scorne an image, or protest, May all be bad; doubt wisely, in strange way To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; To sleepe, or runne wrong, is: on a huge hill, Cragg'd, and steep, Truth stands, and hee that will Reach her, about must, and about must goe; And what the hills suddennes resists, winne so; Yet strive so, that before age, deaths twilight, Thy Soule rest, for none can worke in that night, To will, implyes delay, therefore now doe Hard deeds, the bodies paines; hard knowledge to The mindes indeavours reach, and mysteries Are like the Sunne, dazling, yet plaine to all eyes; Keepe the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand In so ill case, that God hath with his hand Sign'd Kings blanck-charters to kill whom they hate, Nor are they Vicars, but hangmen to Fate. Foole and wretch, wilt thou let thy Soule be tyed To mans lawes, by which she shall not be tryed At the last day? Will it then boot thee To say a Philip, or a Gregory, A Harry, or a Martin taught thee this? Is not this excuse for mere contraries, Equally strong cannot both sides say so? That thou mayest rightly obey power, her bounds know; Those past, her nature, &amp; name is chang'd to be, Then humble to her is idolatrie; As streames are, Power is, those blest flowers that dwell At the rough streames calme head, thrive and do well, But having left their roots, and themselves given To the streames tyrannous rage, alas are driven Through mills, &amp; rockes, &amp; woods, and at last, almost Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost: So perish Soules, which more chuse mens unjust Power from God claym'd, then God himselfe to trust. Satyre IIII. [Well; I may now receive, and die; My sinne] Well; I may now receive, and die; My sinne Indeed is great, but I have beene in A Purgatorie, such as fear'd hell is A recreation, and scant map of this. My minde, neither with prides itch, nor yet hath been Poyson'd with love to see, or to bee seene, I had no suit there, nor new suite to shew, Yet went to Court; But as Glaze which did goe To Masse in jest, catch'd, was faine to disburse The hundred markes, which is the Statutes curse; Before he scapt, So'it pleas'd my destinie (Guilty of my sin of going,) to thinke me As prone to all ill, and of good as forget- full, as proud, as lustfull, and as much in debt, As vaine, as witlesse, and as false as they Which dwell in Court, for once going that way. Therefore I suffered this; Towards me did runne A thing more strange, then on Niles slime, the Sunne E'r bred, or all which into Noahs Arke came: A thing, which would have pos'd Adam to name, Stranger then seaven Antiquaries studies, Then Africks Monsters, Guianaes rarities, Stranger then strangers; One, who for a Dane, In the Danes Massacre had sure beene slaine, If he had liv'd then; And without helpe dies, When next the Prentises'gainst Strangers rise. One, whom the watch at noone lets scarce goe by, One, to whom, the examining Justice sure would cry, Sir, by your priesthood tell me what you are. His cloths were str?ge, though coarse; &amp; black, though bare; Sleevelesse his jerkin was, and it had beene Velvet, but 'twas now (so much ground was seene) Become Tufftaffatie; and our children shall See it plaine Rashe awhile, then nought at all. This thing hath travail'd, and saith, speakes all tongues And only knoweth what to all States belongs, Made of th'Accents, and best phrase of all these, He speakes one language; If strange meats displease, Art can deceive, or hunger force my tast, But Pedants motley tongue, souldiers bumbast, Mountebankes drugtongue, nor the termes of law Are strong enough preparatives, to draw Me to beare this, yet I must be content With his tongue: in his tongue, call'd complement: In which he can win widdowes, and pay scores, Make men speake treason, cosen subtlest whores, Out-flatter favorites, or outlie either Jovius, or Surius, or both together. He names mee, and comes to mee; I whisper, God! How have I sinn'd, that thy wraths furious rod, This fellow chuseth me? He saith, Sir, I love your judgement; Whom doe you prefer, For the best linguist? And I seelily Said, that I thought Calepines Dictionarie; Nay, but of men, most sweet Sir. Beza then, Some Jesuites, and two reverend men Of our two Academies, I named; There He stopt mee, and said; Nay, your Apostles were Good pretty linguists, and so Panirge was; Yet a poore gentleman; All these may passe By travaile. Then, as if he would have sold His tongue, he praised it, and such words told That I was faine to say, If you'had liv'd, Sir, Time enough to have beene Interpreter To Babells bricklayers, sure the Tower had stood. He adds, If of court life you knew the good, You would leave lonelinesse; I said, not alone My lonelinesse is, but Spartanes fashion, To teach by painting drunkards, doth not last Now; Aretines pictures have made few chast; No more can Princes courts, though there be few Better pictures of vice, teach me vertue; He, like to a high stretcht lute string squeakt, O Sir, 'Tis sweet to talke of Kings. At Westminster, Said I, The man that keepes the Abbey tombes, And for his price doth with who ever comes, Of all our Harries, and our Edwards talke, From King to King and all their kin can walke: Your eares shall heare nought, but Kings; your eyes meet Kings only; The way to it, is Kingstreet. He smack'd, and cry'd, He's base, Mechanique, coarse, So are all your Englishmen in their discourse. Are not your Frenchmen neate? Fine, as you see, I have but one frenchman, looke, hee followes mee. Certes they are neatly cloth'd. I, of this minde am, Your only wearing is your Grogaram; Not so Sir, I have more. Under this pitch He would not flie; I chaff'd him; But as Itch Scratch'd into smart, and as blunt iron grown'd Into an edge, hurts worse: So, I foole found, Crossing hurt mee; To fit my sullennesse, He to another key, his stile doth addresse. And askes, what newes? I tell him of new playes. He takes my hand, and as a Still, which staies A Sembriefe, 'twixt each drop, he nigardly, As loth to enrich mee, so tells many a lie, More then ten Hollensheads, or Halls, or Stowes, Of triviall houshold trash; He knowes; He knowes When the Queene frown'd, or smil'd, and he knowes what A subtle States-man may gather of that; He knowes who loves; whom; and who by poyson Hasts to an Offices reversion; He knowes who'hath sold his land, and now doth beg A licence, old iron, bootes, shooes, and egge- shels to transport; Shortly boyes shall not play At span-counter, or blow-point, but shall pay Toll to some Courtier; And wiser then all us, He knowes what Ladie is not painted; Thus He with home-meats tries me; I belch, spue, spit, Looke pale, and sickly, like a Patient; Yet He thrusts on more; And as if he'undertooke To say Gallo-Belgicus without booke Speakes of all States, and deeds, that hath been since The Spaniards came, to the losse of Amyens. Like a bigge wife, at sight of loathed meat, Readie to travaile: So I sigh, and sweat To heare this Makeron talke in vaine: For yet, Either my humour, or his owne to fit, He like a priviledg'd spie, whom nothing can Discredit, Libells now 'gainst each great man. He names a price for every office paid; He saith, our warres thrive ill, because delai'd; That offices are entail'd, and that there are Perpetuities of them, lasting as farre As the last day; And that great officers, Doe with the Pirates share, and Dunkirkers. Who wasts in meat, in clothes, in horse, he notes; Who loves Whores, who boyes, and who goats. I more amas'd then Circes prisoners, when They felt themselves turne beasts, felt my selfe then Becomming Traytor, and mee thought I saw One of our Giant Statutes ope his jaw To sucke me in, for hearing him. I found [That as burnt venome Leachers doe grow sound]These two and a half lines were censored in the 1633 edition and are added here from the 1635 edition. [By giving others their soares, I might grow] [Guilty, and he free:] Therefore I did shew All signes of loathing; But since I am in, I must pay mine, and my forefathers sinne To the last farthing; Therefore to my power Toughly and stubbornly I beare this crosse; But the 'houre Of mercy now was come; He tries to bring Me to pay a fine to scape his torturing, And saies, Sir, can you spare me; I said, willingly; Nay, Sir, can you spare me a crowne? Thankfully I Gave it, as Ransome; But as fidlers, still, Though they be paid to be gone, yet needs will Thrust one more jigge upon you: so did hee With his long complementall thankes vexe me. But he is gone, thankes to his needy want, And the prerogative of my Crowne: Scant His thankes were ended, when I, (which did see All the court fill'd with more strange things then hee) Ran from thence with such or more hast, then one Who feares more actions, doth hast from prison; At home in wholesome solitarinesse My precious soule began, the wretchednesse Of suiters at court to mourne, and a trance Like his, who dreamt he saw hell, did advance It selfe on mee, Such men as he saw there, I saw at court, and worse, and more; Low feare Becomes the guiltie, not the accuser; Then, Shall I, nones slave, of high borne, or rais'd men Feare frownes? And, my Mistresse Truth, betray thee To huffing, braggart, puft Nobility. No, no, Thou which since yesterday hast beene Almost about the whole world, hast thou seene, O Sunne, in all thy journey, Vanitie, Such as swells the bladder of our court? I Thinke he which made your waxen garden, and Transported it from Italy to stand With us, at London, flouts our Presence, for Just such gay painted things, which no sappe, nor Tast have in them, ours are, And naturall Some of the stocks are, their fruits, bastard all. 'Tis ten a clock and past; All whom the Mues, Baloune, Tennis, Dyet, or the stewes, Had all the morning held, now the second Time made ready, that day, in flocks, are found In the Presence, and I, (God pardon mee.) As fresh, and sweet their Apparrells be, as bee The fields they sold to buy them; For a King Those hose are, cry the flatterers; And bring Them next weeke to the Theatre to sell; Wants reach all states; Me seemes they doe as well At stage, as court; All are players, who e'r lookes (For themselves dare not goe) o'r Cheapside books, Shall finde their wardrops Inventory; Now, The Ladies come; As Pirats, which doe know That there came weak ships fraught with Cutchannel, The men board them; and praise, as they thinke, well, Their beauties; they the mens wits; Both are bought. Why good wits ne'r weare scarlet gownes, I thought This cause, These men, mens wits for speeches buy, And women buy all reds which scarlets die. He call'd her beauty limetwigs, her haire net. She feares her drugs ill laid, her haire loose set; Would not Heraclitus laugh to see Macrine, From hat, to shooe, himselfe at doore refine, As if the Presence were a Moschite, and lift His skirts and hose, and call his clothes to shrift, Making them confesse not only mortall Great staines and holes in them; but veniall Feathers and dust, wherewith they fornicate. And then by Durers rules survay the state Of his each limbe, and with strings the odds tries Of his neck to his legge, and wast to thighes. So in immaculate clothes, and Symetrie Perfect as circles, with such nicetie As a young Preacher at his first time goes To preach, he enters, and a Lady which owes Him not so much as good will, he arrests, And unto her protests protests protests So much as at Rome would serve to have throwne Ten Cardinalls into the Inquisition; And whisperd by Jesu, so often, that A Pursevant would have ravish'd him away For saying of our Ladies psalter; But 'tis fit That they each other plague, they merit it. But here comes Glorius that will plague them both, Who, in the other extreme, only doth Call a rough carelessenesse, good fashion; Whose cloak his spurres teare; whom he spits on He cares not, His ill words doe no harme To him; he rusheth in, as if arme, arme, He meant to crie; And though his face be as ill As theirs which in old hangings whip Christ, yet still He strives to looke worse, he keepes all in awe; Jeasts like a licenc'd foole, commands like law. Tyr'd, now I leave this place, and but pleas'd so As men from gaoles to'execution goe, Goe through the great chamber (why is it hung With the seaven deadly sinnes) being among Those Askaparts, men big enough to throw Charing Crosse for a barre, men that doe know No token of worth, but Queenes man, and fine Living barrells of beefe, flaggons of wine. I shooke like a spyed Spie; Preachers which are Seas of Wits and Arts, you can, then dare, Drowne the sinnes of this place, for, for mee Which am but a scarce brooke, it enough shall bee To wash the staines away; though I yet With Macchabees modestie, the knowne merit Of my worke lessen: yet some wise man shall, I hope, esteeme my writs Canonicall. Satyre V. [Thou shalt not laugh in this leafe, Muse, nor they] Thou shalt not laugh in this leafe, Muse, nor they Whom any pitty warmes; He which did lay Rules to make Courtiers, (hee being understood May make good Courtiers, but who Courtiers good?) Frees from the sting of jests all who in extreme Are wreched or wicked: of these two a theame Charity and liberty give me. What is hee Who Officers rage, and Suiters misery Can write, and jest? If all things be in all, As I thinke, since all, which were, are, and shall Bee, be made of the same elements: Each thing, each thing employes or represents, Then man is a world; in which, Officers, Are the vast ravishing seas; and Suiters, Springs; now full, now shallow, now drye; which, to That which drownes them, run: These selfe reasons do Prove the world a man, in which, officers Are the devouring stomacke, and Suiters The excrements, which they voyd; all men are dust, How much worse are Suiters, who to mens lust Are made preyes. O worse then dust, or wormes meat, For they do eate you now, whose selves wormes shall eate. They are the mills which grinde you, yet you are The winde which drives them; and a wastfull warre Is fought against you, and you fight it; they Adulterate lawe, and you prepare their way Like wittals, th'issue your owne ruine is; Greatest and fairest Empresse, know you this? Alas, no more then Thames calme head doth know Whose meades her armes drowne, or whose corne o'rflow: You Sir, whose righteousnes she loves, wh? I By having leave to serve, am most richly For service paid, authorized, now beginne To know and weed out this enormous sinne. O Age of rusty iron! Some better wit Call it some worse name, if ought equall it; The iron Age that was, when justice was sold, now Injustice is sold deerer farre; allow All demands, fees, and duties; gamsters, anon The mony which you sweat, and sweare for, is gon Into other hands: So controverted lands Scape, like Angelica, the strivers hands. If Law be in the Judges heart, and hee Have no heart to resist letter, or fee, Where wilt thou appeale? powre of the Courts below Flow from the first maine head, and these can throw Thee, if they sucke thee in, to misery, To fetters, halters; But if the injury Steele thee to dare complaine; Alas, thou goest Against the stream, when upwards: when thou art most Heavy and most faint; and in these labours they, 'Gainst whom thou should'st complaine, will in the way Become great seas, o'r which, when thou shalt bee Forc'd to make golden bridges, thou shalt see That all thy gold was drown'd in them before; All things follow their like, only, who have, may have more Judges are Gods; he who made and said them so, Meant not that men should be forc'd to them to goe, By meanes of Angels; When supplications We send to God, to Dominations, Powers, Cherubins, and all heavens Court, if wee Should pay fees as here, Daily bread would be Scarce to Kings; so 'tis, would it not anger A Stoicke, a coward, yea a Martyr, To see a Pursivant come in, and call All his cloathes, Copes; Bookes, Primers; and all His Plate, Challices; and mistake them away, And lack a fee for comming; Oh, ne'r may Faire lawes white reverend name be strumpeted, To warrant thefts: she is established Recorder to Destiny, on earth, and shee Speakes Fates words, and tells who must bee Rich, who poore, who in chaires, who in jayles: Shee is all faire, but yet hath foule long nailes, With which she scracheth Suiters; In bodies Of men; so in law, nailes are extremities, So Officers stretch to more then Law can doe, As our nailes reach what no else part comes to. Why barest thou to yon Officer? Foole, Hath hee Got those goods, for which men bared to thee? Foole, twice, thrice, thou hast bought wrong, and now hungerly Beg'st right; But that dole comes not till these dye. Thou had'st much, &amp; lawes Urim and Thummim trie Thou wouldst for more; and for all hast paper Enough to cloath all the great Carricks Pepper. Sell that, and by that thou much more shalt leefe, Then Haman, when he sold his Antiquities. O wretch that thy fortunes should moralize Esops fables, and make tales, prophesies. Thou art the swimming dog whom shadows cosened, And div'st, neare drowning, for what vanished. A Hymne to God the Father I Wilt thou forgive that sinne where I begunne, which was my sin, though it were done before? Wilt thou forgive that sinne; through which I runne, And do run still: though still I do deplore? When thou hast done, thou hast not done, For, I have more. II Wilt thou forgive that sinne which I have wonne Others to sinne? and, made my sinne their doore? Wilt thou forgive that sinne which I did shunne A yeare, or two: but wallowed in, a score? When thou hast done, thou hast not done, For I have more. III I have a sinne of feare, that when I have spunne My last thred, I shall perish on the shore; But sweare by thy selfe, that at my death thy sonne Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore; And, having done that, Thou haste done, I feare no more. Elegies upon the Author TO THE MEMORIE OF MY EVER DESIRED FRIEND D?. Donne To have liv'd eminent, in a degree Beyond our lofty'st flights, that is, like Thee, Or t'have had too much merit, is not safe; For, such excesses finde no Epitaph. At common graves we have Poetique eyes Can melt themselves in easie Elegies, Each quill can drop his tributary verse, And pin it, like the Hatchments, to the Hearse: But at Thine, Poeme, or Inscription (Rich soule of wit, and language) we have none. Indeed a silence does that tombe befit, Where is no Herald left to blazon it. Widow'd invention justly doth forbeare To come abroad, knowing Thou art not here, Late her great Patron; Whose Prerogative Maintain'd, and cloth'd her so, as none alive Must now presume, to keepe her at thy rate, Though he the Indies for her dowre estate. Or else that awfull fire, which once did burne In thy cleare Braine, now falne into thy Urne Lives there, to fright rude Empiricks from thence, Which might prophane thee by their Ignorance. Who ever writes of Thee, and in a stile Unworthy such a Theme, does but revile Thy precious Dust, and wake a learned Spirit Which may revenge his Rapes upon thy Merit. For, all a low pitch't phansie can devise, Will prove, at best, but Hallow'd Injuries. Thou, like the dying Swanne, didst lately sing Thy Mournfull Dirge, in audience of the King; When pale lookes, and faint accents of thy breath, Presented so, to life, that peece of death, That it was fear'd, and prophesi'd by all, Thou thither cam'st to preach thy Funerall. O! had'st Thou in an Elegiacke Knell Rung out unto the world thine owne farewell, And in thy High Victorious Numbers beate The solemne measure of thy griev'd Retreat; Thou might'st the Poets service now have mist As well, as then thou did'st prevent the Priest; And never to the world beholding bee So much, as for an Epitaph for thee. I doe not like the office. Nor is 't fit Thou, who did'st lend our Age such summes of wit, Should'st now re-borrow from her bankrupt Mine, That Ore to Bury Thee, which once was Thine. Rather still leave us in thy debt; And know (Exalted Soule) more glory't is to owe Unto thy Hearse, what we can never pay, Then, with embased Coine those Rites defray. Commit we then Thee to Thy selfe: Nor blame Our drooping loves, which thus to thy owne Fame Leave Thee Executour. Since, but thine owne, No pen could doe Thee Justice, nor Bayes Crowne Thy vast desert; Save that, wee nothing can Depute, to be thy Ashes Guardian. So Jewellers no Art, or Metall trust To forme the Diamond, but the Diamonds dust, H. K. To the deceased Author, Upon the Promiscuous printing of his Poems, the Looser sort, with the Religious. When thy Loose raptures, Donne, shall meet with Those That doe confine Tuning, unto the Duller line, And sing not, but in Sanctified Prose; How will they, with sharper eyes, The Fore-skinne of thy phansie circumcise? And feare, thy wantonnesse should now, begin Example, that hath ceased to be Sin? And that Feare fannes their Heat; whilst knowing eyes Will not admire At this Strange Fire, That here is mingled with thy Sacrifice: But dare reade even thy Wanton Story, As thy Confession, not thy Glory. And will so envie Both to future times, That they would buy thy Goodnesse, with thy Crimes. Tho: Browne. On the death of D? Donne. I cannot blame those men, that knew thee well, Yet dare not helpe the world, to ring thy knell In tunefull Elegies; there's not language knowne Fit for thy mention, but 'twas first thy owne; The Epitaphs thou writst, have so bereft Our tongue of wit, there is not phansie left Enough to weepe thee; what henceforth we see Of Art or Nature, must result from thee. There may perchance some busie gathering friend Steale from thy owne workes, and that, varied, lend, Which thou bestow'st on others, to thy Hearse, And so thou shalt live still in thine owne verse; Hee that shall venture farther, may commit A pitied errour, shew his zeale, not wit. Fate hath done mankinde wrong; vertue may aime Reward of conscience, never can, of fame, Since her great trumpet's broke, could onely give Faith to the world, command it to beleeve; Hee then must write, that world define thy parts: Here lyes the best Divinitie, All the Arts. Edw. Hyde. On Doctor Donne, By D? C. B. of O. Hee that would write an Epitaph for thee, And do it well, must first beginne to be Such as thou wert; for, none can truly know Thy worth, thy life, but he that hath liv'd so; He must have wit to spare and to hurle downe: Enough, to keepe the gallants of the towne. He must have learning plenty; both the Lawes, Civill, and Common, to judge any cause; Divinity great store, above the rest; Not of the last Edition, but the best. Hee must have language, travaile, all the Arts; Judgement to use; or else he wants thy parts. He must have friends the highest, able to do; Such as Mecœnas, and Augustus too. He must have such a sicknesse, such a death; Or else his vaine descriptions come beneath; Who then shall write an Epitaph for thee, He must be dead first, let'it alone for mee. An Elegie upon the incomparable D? Donne. All is not well when such a one as I Dare peepe abroad, and write an Elegie; When smaller Starres appeare, and give their light, Phœbus is gone to bed: Were it not night, And the world witlesse now that Donne is dead, You sooner should have broke, then seene my head. Dead did I say? Forgive this Injury I doe him, and his worthes Infinity, To say he is but dead; I dare averre It better may be term'd a Massacre, Then Sleepe or Death; See how the Muses mourne Upon their oaten Reeds, and from his Vrne Threaten the World with this Calamity, They shall have Ballads, but no Poetry. Language lyes speechlesse; and Divinity, Lost such a Trump as even to Extasie Could charme the Soule, and had an Influence To teach best judgements, and please dullest Sense. The Court, the Church, the Vniversitie, Lost Chaplaine, Deane, and Doctor, All these, Three. It was his Merit, that his Funerall Could cause a losse so great and generall. If there be any Spirit can answer give Of such as hence depart, to such as live: Speake, Doth his body there vermiculate, Crumble to dust, and feele the lawes of Fate? Me thinkes, Corruption, Wormes, what else is foule Should spare the Temple of so faire a Soule. I could beleeve they doe; but that I know What inconvenience might hereafter grow: Succeeding ages would Idolatrize, And as his Numbers, so his Reliques prize. If that Philosopher, which did avow The world to be but Motes, was living now: He would affirme that th'Atomes of his mould Were they in severall bodies blended, would Produce new worlds of Travellers, Divines, Of Linguists, Poets: sith these severall lines In him concentred were, and flowing thence Might fill againe the worlds Circumference. I could beleeve this too; and yet my faith Not want a President: The Phœnix hath (And such was He) a power to animate Her ashes, and herselfe perpetuate. But, busie Soule, thou dost not well to pry Into these Secrets; Griefe, and Iealousie, The more they know, the further still advance, And finde no way so safe as Ignorance. Let this suffice thee, that his Soule which flew A pitch of all admir'd, known but of few, (Save those of purer mould) is now translated From Earth to Heavên, and there Constellated. For, if each Priest of God shine as a Starre, His Glory is as his Gifts, 'bove others farre. Hen. Valentine. An Elegie upon D? Donne. Is Donne, great Donne deceas'd? then England say Thou'hast lost a man where language chose to stay And shew it's gracefull power. I would not praise That and his vast wit (which in these vaine dayes Make many proud) but as they serv'd to unlock That Cabinet, his minde: where such a stock Of knowledge was repos'd, as all lament (Or should) this generall cause of discontent. And I rejoyce I am not so severe, But (as I write a line) to weepe a teare For his decease; Such sad extremities May make such men as I write Elegies. And wonder not; for, when a generall losse Falls on a nation, and they slight the crosse, God hath rais'd Prophets to awaken them From stupifaction; witnesse my milde pen, Not us'd to upbraid the world, though now it must Freely and boldly, for, the cause is just. Dull age, Oh I would spare thee, but th'art worse, Thou art not onely dull, but hast a curse Of black ingratitude; if not, couldst thou Part with miraculous Donne, and make no vow For thee and thine, successively to pay A sad remembrance to his dying day? Did his youth scatter Poetrie, wherein Was all Philosophie? Was every sinne, Character'd in his Satyres? made so foule That some have fear'd their shapes, &amp; kept their soule Freer by reading verse? Did he give dayes Past marble monuments, to those, whose praise He would perpetuate? Did hee (I feare The dull will doubt:) these at his twentieth yeare? But, more matur'd: Did his full soule conceive, And in harmonious-holy-numbers weave A Crowme of sacred sonets, fit to adorne La Corona. A dying Martyrs brow: or, to be worne On that blest head of Mary Magdalen: After she wip'd Christs feet, but not till then? Did hee (fit for such penitents as shee And hee to use) leave us a Litany? Which all devout men love, and sure, it shall, As times grow better, grow more classicall. Did he write Hymnes, for piety and wit Equall to those great grave Prudentius writ? Spake he all Languages? knew he all Lawes? The grounds and use of Physicke; but because 'Twas mercenary wav'd it? Went to see That blessed place of Christs nativity? Did he returne and preach him? preach him so As none but hee did, or could do? They know (Such as were blest to heare him know) 'tis truth, Did he confirme thy age? convert thy youth? Did he these wonders? And is this deare losse Mourn'd by so few? (few for so great a crosse.) But sure the silent are ambitious all To be Close Mourners at his Funerall; If not; In common pitty they forbare By repetitions to renew our care; Or, knowing, griefe conceiv'd, conceal'd, consumes Man irreparably, (as poyson'd fumes Do waste the braine) make silence a safe way To'inlarge the Soule from these walls, mud and clay, (Materialls of this body) to remaine With Donne in heaven, where no promiscuous paine Lessens the joy wee have, for, with him, all Are satisfyed with joyes essentiall. My thoughts, Dwell on this Ioy, and do not call Griefe backe, by thinking of his Funerall; Forget he lov'd mee; Waste not my sad yeares; (Which haste to Davids seventy) fill'd with feares And sorrow for his death;) Forget his parts, Which finde a living grave in good mens hearts; And, (for, my first is daily paid for finne) Forget to pay my second sigh for him: Forget his powerfull preaching; and forget I am his Convert. Oh my frailtie! let My flesh be no more heard, it will obtrude This lethargie: so should my gratitude, My vowes of gratitude should so be broke; Which can no more be, then Donnes vertues spoke By any but himselfe; for which cause, I Write no Encomium, but an Elegie. Iz. Wa. An Elegie upon the death of the Deane of Pauls, D?. Iohn Donne: By M?. Tho: Carie. Can we not force from widdowed Poetry, Now thou art dead (Great Donne) one Elegie To crowne thy Hearse? Why yet dare we not trust Though with unkneaded dowe-bak't prose thy dust, Such as the uncisor'd Churchman from the flower Of fading Rhetorique, short liv'd as his houre, Dry as the sand that measures it, should lay Upon thy Ashes, on the funerall day? Have we no voice, no tune? Did'st thou dispense Through all our language, both the words and sense? 'Tis a sad truth; The Pulpit may her plaine, And sober Christian precepts still retaine, Doctrines it may, and wholesome Uses frame, Grave Homilies, and Lectures, But the flame Of thy brave Soule, that shot such heat and light, As burnt our earth, and made our darknesse bright, Committed holy Rapes upon our Will, Did through the eye the melting heart distill; And the deepe knowledge of darke truths so teach, As sense might judge, what phansie could not reach; Must be desir'd for ever. So the fire, That fills with spirit and heat the Delphique quire, Which kindled first by thy Promethean breath, Glow'd here a while, lies quench't now in thy death; The Muses garden with Pedantique weedes O'rspred, was purg'd by thee; The lazie seeds Of servile imitation throwne away; And fresh invention planted, Thou didst pay The debts of our penurious bankrupt age; Licentious thefts, that make poëtique rage A Mimique fury, when our soules must bee Possest, or with Anacreons Extasie, Or Pindars, not their owne; The subtle cheat Of slie Exchanges, and the jugling feat Of two-edg'd words, or whatsoever wrong By ours was done the Greeke, or Latine tongue, Thou hast redeem'd, and open'd Us a Mine Of rich and pregnant phansie, drawne a line Of masculine expression, which had good Old Orpheus seene, Or all the ancient Brood Our superstitious fooles admire, and hold Their lead more precious, then thy burnish't Gold, Thou hadst beene their Exchequer, and no more They each in others dust, had rak'd for Ore. Thou shalt yield no precedence, but of time, And the blinde fate of language, whose tun'd chime More charmes the outward sense; Yet thou maist claime From so great disadvantage greater fame, Since to the awe of thy imperious wit Our stubborne language bends, made only fit With her tough-thick-rib'd hoopes to gird about Thy Giant phansie, which had prov'd too stout For their soft melting Phrases. As in time They had the start, so did they cull the prime Buds of invention many a hundred yeare, And left the rifled fields, besides the feare To touch their Harvest, yet from those bare lands Of what is purely thine, thy only hands (And that thy smallest worke) have gleaned more Then all those times, and tongues could reape before; But thou art gone, and thy strict lawes will be Too hard for Libertines in Poetrie. They will repeale the goodly exil'd traine Of gods and goddesses, which in thy just raigne Were banish'd nobler Poems, now, with these The silenc'd tales o'th'Metamorphoses Shall stuffe their lines, and swell the windy Page, Till Verse refin'd by thee, in this last Age, Turne ballad rime, Or those old Idolls bee Ador'd againe, with new apostasie; Oh, pardon mee, that breake with untun'd verse The reverend silence that attends thy herse, Whose awfull solemne murmures were to thee More then these faint lines, A loud Elegie, That did proclaime in a dumbe eloquence The death of all the Arts, whose influence Growne feeble, in these panting numbers lies Gasping short winded Accents, and so dies: So doth the swiftly turning wheele not stand In th'instant we withdraw the moving hand, But some small time maintaine a faint weake course By vertue of the first impulsive force: And so whil'st I cast on thy funerall pile Thy crowne of Bayes, Oh, let it crack a while, And spit disdaine, till the devouring flashes Suck all the moysture up, then turne to ashes. I will not draw the envy to engrosse All thy perfections, or weepe all our losse; Those are too numerous for an Elegie, And this too great, to be express'd by mee. Though every pen should share a distinct part, Yet art thou Theme enough to tyre all Art; Let others carve the rest, it shall suffice I on thy Tombe this Epitaph incise. Here lies a King, that rul'd as hee thought fit The universall Monarchy of wit; Here lie two Flamens, and both those, the best, Apollo's first, at last, the true Gods Priest. An Elegie on D?. Donne: By Sir Lucius Carie. Poets attend, the Elegie I sing Both of a doubly-named Priest, and King: In stead of Coates, and Pennons, bring your Verse, For you must bee chiefe mourners at his Hearse, A Tombe your Muse must to his Fame supply, No other Monuments can never die; And as he was a two-fold Priest; in youth, Apollo's; afterwards, the voice of Truth, Gods Conduit-pipe for grace, who chose him for His extraordinary Embassador, So let his Liegiers with the Poets joyne, Both having shares, both must in griefe combine: Whil'st Johnson forceth with his Elegie Teares from a griefe-unknowing Scythians eye, (Like Moses at whose stroke the waters gusht From forth the Rock, and like a Torrent rusht.) Let Lawd his funerall Sermon preach, and shew Those vertues, dull eyes were not apt to know, Nor leave that Piercing Theme, till it appeares To be good friday, by the Churches Teares; Yet make not griefe too long oppresse our Powers, Least that his funerall Sermon should prove ours. Nor yet forget that heavenly Eloquence, With which he did the bread of life dispense, Preacher and Orator discharg'd both parts With pleasure for our sense, health for our hearts, And the first such (Though a long studied Art Tell us our soule is all in every part,) None was so marble, but whil'st him he heares, His Soule so long dwelt only in his eares. And from thence (with the fiercenesse of a flood Bearing downe vice) victual'd with that blest food Their hearts; His seed in none could faile to grow, Fertile he found them all, or made them so: No Druggist of the Soule bestow'd on all So Catholiquely a curing Cordiall. Nor only in the Pulpit dwelt his store, His words work'd much, but his example more, That preach't on worky dayes, His Poetrie It selfe was oftentimes divinity, Those Anthemes (almost second Psalmes) he writ To make us know the Crosse, and value it, (Although we owe that reverence to that name Wee should not need warmth from an under flame.) Creates a fire in us, so neare extreme That we would die, for, and upon this theme. Next, his so pious Litany, which none can But count Divine, except a Puritan, And that but for the name, nor this, nor those Want any thing of Sermons, but the prose. Experience makes us see, that many a one Owes to his Countrey his Religion; And in another, would as strongly grow, Had but his Nurse and Mother taught him so, Not hee the ballast on his Judgement hung; Nor did his preconceit doe either wrong; He labour'd to exclude what ever sinne By time or carelessenesse had entred in; Winnow'd the chaffe from wheat, but yet was loath A too hot zeale should force him, burne them both; Nor would allow of that so ignorant gall, Which to save blotting often would blot all; Nor did those barbarous opinions owne, To thinke the Organs sinne, and faction, none; Nor was there expectation to gaine grace From forth his Sermons only, but his face; So Primitive a looke, such gravitie With humblenesse, and both with Pietie; So milde was Moses countenance, when he prai'd For them whose Satanisme his power gainsaid; And such his gravitie, when all Gods band Receiv' his word (through him) at second hand, Which joyn'd, did flames of more devotion move Then ever Argive Hellens could of love. Now to conclude, I must my reason bring, Wherefore I call'd him in his title King, That Kingdome the Philosophers beleev'd To excell Alexanders, nor were griev'd By feare of losse (that being such a Prey No stronger then ones selfe can force away) The Kingdome of ones selfe, this he enjoy'd, And his authoritie so well employ'd, That never any could before become So Great a Monarch, in so small a roome; He conquer'd rebell passions, rul'd them so, As under-spheares by the first Mover goe, Banish't so farre their working, that we can But know he had some, for we knew him man. Then let his last excuse his first extremes, His age saw visions, though his youth dream'd dreams. On D?. Donnes death: By M?. Mayne of Christ-Church in Oxford. Who shall presume to mourn thee, Donne, unlesse He could his teares in thy expressions dresse, And teach his griefe that reverence of thy Hearse, To weepe lines, learned, as thy Anniverse, A Poëme of that worth, whose every teare Deserves the title of a severall yeare. Indeed so farre above its Reader, good, That wee are thought wits, when 'tis understood, There that blest maid to die, who now should grieve? After thy sorrow, 'twere her losse to live; And her faire vertues in anothers line, Would faintly dawn, which are made Saints in thine. Hadst thou beene shallower, and not writ so high, Or left some new way for our pennes, or eye, To shed a funerall teare, perchance thy Tombe Had not beene speechlesse, or our Muses dumbe; But now wee dare not write, but must conceale Thy Epitaph, lest we be thought to steale, For, who hath read thee, and discernes thy worth, That will not say, thy carelesse houres brought forth Fancies beyond our studies, and thy play Was happier, then our serious time of day? So learned was thy chance; thy haste had wit, And matter from thy pen flow'd rashly fit, What was thy recreation turnes our braine, Our rack and palenesse, is thy weakest straine. And when we most come neere thee, 'tis our blisse To imitate thee, where thou dost amisse, Here light your muse, you that do onely thinke, And write, and are just Poëts, as you drinke, In whose weake fancies wit doth ebbe and flow, Just as your recknings rise, that wee may know In your whole carriage of your worke, that here This flash you wrote in Wine, and this in Beere, This is to tap your Muse, which running long Writes flat, and takes our eare not halfe so strong; Poore Suburbe wits, who, if you want your cup, Or if a Lord recover, are blowne up. Could you but reach this height, you should not need To make, each meale, a project ere you feed, Nor walke in reliques, clothes so old and bare, As if left off to you from Ennius were, Nor should your love, in verse, call Mistresse, those, Who are mine hostesse, or your whores in prose; From this Muse learne to Court, whose power could move A Cloystred coldnesse, or a Vestall love, And would convey such errands to their eare, That Ladies knew no oddes to grant and heare; But I do wrong thee, Donne, and this low praise Is written onely for thy yonger dayes. I am not growne up, for thy riper parts, Then should I praise thee, through the Tongues, and Arts, And have that deepe Divinity, to know, What mysteries did from thy preaching flow, Who with thy words could charme thy audience, That at thy sermons, eare was all our sense; Yet have I seene thee in the pulpit stand, Where wee might take notes, from thy looke, and hand; And from thy speaking action beare away More Sermon, then some teachers use to say. Such was thy carriage, and thy gesture such, As could divide the heart, and conscience touch. Thy motion did confute, and wee might see An errour vanquish'd by delivery. Not like our Sonnes of Zeale, who to reforme Their hearers, fiercely at the Pulpit storme, And beate the cushion into worse estate, Then if they did conclude it reprobate, Who can out pray the glasse, then lay about Till all Predestination be runne out. And from the point such tedious uses draw, Their repetitions would make Gospell, Law. No, In such temper would thy Sermons flow, So well did Doctrine, and thy language show, And had that holy feare, as, hearing thee, The Court would mend, and a good Christian bee. And Ladies though unhansome, out of grace, Would heare thee, in their unbought lookes, &amp; face, More I could write, but let this crowne thine Urne, Wee cannot hope the like, till thou returne. Upon M? J. Donne, and his Poems. Who dares say thou art dead, when he doth see (Unburied yet) this living part of thee? This part that to thy beeing gives fresh flame, And though th'art Donne, yet will preserve thy name. Thy flesh (whose channels left their crimson hew, And whey-like ranne at last in a pale blew) May shew thee mortall, a dead palsie may Seise on't, and quickly turne it into clay; Which like the Indian earth, shall rise refin'd: But this great Spirit thou hast left behinde, This Soule of Verse (in it's first pure estate) Shall live, for all the World to imitate, But not come neer, for in thy Fancies flight Thou dost not stoope unto the vulgar sight, But, hovering highly in the aire of Wit, Hold'st such a pitch, that few can follow it; Admire they may. Each object that the Spring (Or a more piercing influence) doth bring T'adorne Earths face, thou sweetly did'st contrive To beauties elements, and thence derive Unspotted Lillies white; which thou did'st set Hand in hand, with the veine-like Violet, Making them soft, and warme, and by thy power, Could'st give both life, and sense, unto a flower. The Cheries thou hast made to speake, will bee Sweeter unto the taste, then from the tree. And (spight of winter stormes) amidst the snow Thou oft hast made the blushing Rose to grow. The Sea-nimphs, that the watry cavernes keepe, Have sent their Pearles and Rubies from the deepe To deck thy love, and plac'd by thee, they drew More lustre to them, then where first they grew, All minerals (that Earths full wombe doth hold Promiscuously) thou couldst convert to gold, And with thy flaming raptures so refine, That it was much more pure then in the Mine. The lights that guild the night, if thou did'st say, They looke like eyes, those did out-shine the day; For there would be more vertue in such spells, Then in Meridians, or crosse Parallels: What ever was of worth in this great Frame, That Art could comprehend, or Wit could name, It was thy theme for Beauty; thou didst see, Woman, was this faire Worlds Epitomie. Thy nimble Satyres too, and every straine (With nervy strength) that issued from thy brain, Will lose the glory of their owne cleare bayes, If they admit of any others praise. But thy diviner Poëms (whose cleare fire Purges all drosse away) shall by a Quire Of Cherubims, with heavenly Notes be set (Where flesh and blood could ne'r attaine to yet) There purest Spirits sing such sacred Layes, In Panegyrique Alleluiaes. Arth. Wilson. In memory of Doctor Donne: By M? R. B. Donne dead? 'Tis here reported true, though I Ne'r yet so much desir'd to heare a lye, 'Tis too too true, for so wee finde it still, Good newes are often false, but seldome, ill: But must poore fame tell us his fatall day, And shall we know his death, the common way, Mee thinkes some Comet bright should have foretold The death of such a man, for though of old 'Tis held, that Comets Princes death foretell, Why should not his, have needed one as well? Who was the Prince of wits, 'mongst whom he reign'd, High as a Prince, and as great State maintain'd? Yet wants he not his signe, for wee have seene A dearth, the like to which hath never beene, Treading on harvests heeles, which doth presage The death of wit and learning, which this age Shall finde, now he is gone; for though there bee Much graine in shew, none brought it forth as he, Or men are misers; or if true want raises The dearth, then more that dearth Donnes plenty praises. Of learning, languages, of eloquence, And Poësie, (past rauishing of sense,) He had a magazine, wherein such store Was laid up, as might hundreds serve of poore. But he is gone, O how will his desire Torture all those that warm'd them by his fire? Mee thinkes I see him in the pulpit standing, Not eares, or eyes, but all mens hearts commanding, Where wee that heard him, to our selves did faine Golden Chrysostome was alive againe; And never were we weari'd, till we saw His houre (and but an houre) to end did draw. How did he shame the doctrine-men, and use, With helps to boot, for men to beare th'abuse Of their tir'd patience, and endure th'expence Of time, O spent in hearkning to non-sense, With markes also, enough whereby to know, The speaker is a zealous dunce, or so. 'Tis true, they quitted him, to their poore power, They humm'd against him; And with face most sowre Call'd him a strong lin'd man, a Macaroon, And no way fit to speake to clouted shoone, As fine words [truly] as you would desire, But [verily,] but a bad edifier. Thus did these beetles slight in him that good, They could not see, and much lesse understood. But we may say, when we compare the stuffe Both brought; He was a candle, they the snuffe. Well, Wisedome's of her children justifi'd, Let therefore these poore fellowes stand aside; Nor, though of learning he deserv'd so highly, Would I his booke should save him; Rather slily I should advise his Clergie not to pray, Though of the learn'dst sort; Me thinkes that they Of the same trade, are Judges not so fit, There's no such emulation as of wit. Of such, the Envy might as much perchance Wrong him, and more, then th'others ignorance. It was his Fate (I know't) to be envy'd As much by Clerkes, as lay men magnifi'd; And why? but 'cause he came late in the day, And yet his Penny earn'd, and had as they. No more of this, least some should say, that I Am strai'd to Satyre, meaning Elegie. No, no, had Donne need to be judg'd or try'd, A Jury I would summon on his side, That had no sides, nor factions, past the touch Of all exceptions, freed from Passion, such As nor to feare nor flatter, e'r were bred, These would I bring, though called from the dead: Southampton, Hambleton, P?brooke, Dorsets Earles, Huntingdon, Bedfords Countesses (the Pearles Once of each sexe.) If these suffice not, I Ten decem tales have of Standers by: All which, for Donne, would such a verdict give, As can belong to none, that now doth live. But what doe I? A diminution 'tis To speake of him in verse, so short of his, Whereof he was the master; All indeed Compar'd with him, pip'd on an Oaten reed. O that you had but one 'mongst all your brothers Could write for him, as he hath done for others: (Poets I speake to) When I see't, I'll say, My eye-sight betters, as my yeares decay, Meane time a quarrell I shall ever have Against these doughty keepers from the grave, Who use, it seemes their old Authoritie, When (Verses men immortall make) they cry: Which had it been a Recipe true tri'd, Probatum esset, Donne had never dy'd. For mee, if e'r I had least sparke at all Of that which they Poetique fire doe call, Here I confesse it fetched from his hearth, Which is gone out, now he is gone to earth. This only a poore flash, a lightning is Before my Muses death, as after his. Farewell (faire soule) and deigne receive from mee This Type of that devotion I owe thee, From whom (while living) as by voice and penne I learned more, then from a thousand men: So by thy death, am of one doubt releas'd, And now beleeve that miracles are ceas'd. Epitaph. Heere lies Deane Donne; Enough; Those words alone Shew him as fully, as if all the stone His Church of Pauls contains, were through inscrib'd Or all the walkers there, to speake him, brib'd. None can mistake him, for one such as Hee Donne, Deane, or Man, more none shall ever see. Not man? No, though unto a Sunne each eye Were turn'd, the whole earth so to overspie. A bold brave word; Yet such brave Spirits as knew His Spirit, will say, it is lesse bold then true, Epitaph upon D?. Donne, By Endy: Porter. This decent Urne a sad inscription weares, Of Donnes departure from us, to the spheares; And the dumbe stone with silence seemes to tell The changes of this life, wherein is well Exprest, A cause to make all joy to cease, And never let our sorrowes more take ease; For now it is impossible to finde One fraught with vertues, to inrich a minde; But why should death, with a promiscuous hand At one rude stroke impoverish a land? Thou strict Attorney, unto stricter Fate, Didst thou confiscate his life out of hate To his rare Parts? Or didst thou throw thy dart, With envious hand, at some Plebeyan heart; And he with pious vertue stept betweene To save that stroke, and so was kill'd unseene By thee? O 'twas his goodnesse so to doe, Which humane kindnesse never reacht unto. Thus the hard lawes of death were satisfi'd, And he left us like Orphan friends, and di'de. Now from the Pulpit to the peoples cares, Whose speech shall send repentant sighes, and teares? Or tell mee, if a purer Virgin die, Who shall hereafter write her Elegie? Poets be silent, let your numbers sleepe, For he is gone that did all phansie keepe; Time hath no Soule, but his exalted verse; Which with amazements, we may now reherse. FINIS</field>
