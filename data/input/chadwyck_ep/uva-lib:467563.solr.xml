      <field name="fulltext">[Dear Maid, to whom I sent last year] Dear Maid, to whom I sent last year My Meadowsweet. By blossoms asking thee to hear, In hours of wheat And staring poppies, all I needâ My love's unswerving cross and creed Take, for a pity comes again, These Violets. Scentless, perchance, and torn by rain When rain forgets On angry days to spare the soft Green stem that bears the blue aloft So let my flowers come to thee In sweet content; And may thy heart one moment be Their firmament. That when they fade, at fair things must, No god shall rank them common dust A LOVE SONG. Thou art to me like wells in wildernesses That save the thirsty from consuming skies; Thy hand, thy voice, thine ev'ry gesture blessesâ I know thee mine, and I am thine! I kiss thy lips and live in paradiseâ I feel thy heart proclaim it paradise! Tho' summer fall and grass be dead at even, Art thou not here, my love with angel eyes? Tho' stars and gods alike should fall from heaven Thou still art mine, and I am thine! Thy head is on my breast in paradiseâ Thy lips on mine proclaim it paradise! A TRAGEDY. He lies upon a bloody rock Down, down a thousand dizzy feet, A man before the fatal shock, Who now is only eagles' meat! An avalanche? A careless pace? No, none of these!âa woman's face! His wife is in a chamber, far Beyond the horror down below, Upon her head a diamond star, And at her feet the dead man's foe! God! how the hasty vultures dart To scratch his eyes and tear his heart! One with its claws upon his mouth Strikes at the torn and gory coat; While she who slew him, in the south, Bares all the brilliance of her throat To trap the liar's kiss, and says, Thank God he's gone! O worldâO ways! LULLABY. Sleep, my angels, side by side Till the morrow's coming; Till the rosebuds open wide At the brown bee's humming: Clover-spice and butterfly, Faithful in the meadows, Stay where mottled cattle sigh In the cooling shadows. Angel rosebuds, dream and wait Till the sun is peeping At my maid and at her mate, Rosebud angels, sleeping. UNHEEDED. With all the words that love could hope to wake I strove to aid my soul's divine endeavour; But Ruth would never listen. How I ache To speak no more again, no more for ever! O saffron tulips in the heart-shaped bed, Her coldness could not understand my crying; And now I would (for joy and hope are sped) That I, ere ye are dead, might lay a-dying! KISMET. The Moslem squatting on his mat, The Persian praying on his rug, Has this upon his tongue full patâ Life is a grave already dug. And what if on the peach we find The silver trail of midnight slug? Death is the fruit, the world the rindâ Life is a grave already dug. Put by the idol at your side, The pearl you prize, the gold you hug; Remember most the churchyard rideâ Life is a grave already dug. So nipping winds and changing friends Are worth at most a shoulder-shrug; And peace begins when breathing endsâ Life is a grave already dug. I CARE NOT NOW. I care not now as once I cared When Time retain'd and Mercy spar'd The whiteness of her breast; But now that she has been forgiven The curse of living out of heaven Let me lie down and rest. Nor shall I heed if Fortune smite My patient cheek in sullen spite; Nor shall I moan the pain Of seeing ev'ry joy rush past So I may learn the peace at last Of touching her again. For she was tender, tried and true, And lulled me when the tempest blew Where lulling is the best; And now that Death has robbed my head, For (Christ accept her!) she is deadâ Let me lie down and rest. PASSING. O gather round me, fond and few! 'Tis eventime, and ere the dew Has hung its diamond on the rue Or on the sorrel leaf, My soul, so long a restless bird Whose wings upon the cage God heard, Shall win its sunshine, undisturbed, And sing farewell to grief. Is Laura here? Ah, angel-friend, My life had made a bitter end Without your hands and lips to send The traveller on his road! If God to us who die denies All faces far from Paradise I will not, Love, forget your eyes That helped me bear my load. Will you remember for my sake The islet of the girdled lake Whose mountains in the water make A dim, inverted range? These giants through the gaping crust Of earth Time's hand may haply thrust, But memories of the pearl of trust Serve no fine laws of change. I will remember lanes we trod, The lark that made divine its clod, Aye, at the very feet of God I will remember you! So urgent that my soul might pass From slender songs of bud and grass To forge the chant should soundâalas!â Far up the aisles of blue! Oh, if the modest little lyre, My plaything, ever did aspire To strike a sudden verse of fire Your spirit smote the strings! While fervour lingered in your face, Like western glows of evening grace, I sought my hauntsâsome secret placeâ And babbled with the springs. Your spirit, rarer than the lone Great star that clasps Creation's zone, Dreamed in a cloudland of its own Obeying no behest: Apollo gave my rustic muse One only choiceâSing not, or choose Lyrics of cherries, corn and yewsâ And these are in your breast! Tho' singing but the shy and sweet Untrod by multitudes of feet, Songs bounded by the brook and wheat, I have not failed in thisâ The only lure my woodland note, To win all England's whitest throat! O bards in gold and fire who wrote, Be yours all other bliss! Noble it is to lead the van, And make man tenderer to man; Noble to preach some shining plan Of changing men to gods! I felt the honours of the task, But, looking backward, loved to bask Content to learn, to only ask Laura, my birds, my clods! Dearest, you know two brothers' strife Warred round the rapture of your life; For either craved you as his wife, And well you loved them both: On me the marvel of you came, Whereat my brother's heart was flame; Years have not served his wrath to tame, For he was sorely wroth. But now the ancient rancour fliesâ Melting affection in his eyes, He weeps because his brother diesâ Thank Death who brings me this! You love him, Laura. For my sake Let me, tho' dying, live to make This man my heir, that he may take Your brow, your breast, your kiss. And when you pause amid the lakes To worship where the mountain shakes In rainbow-film and foamy flakes, The waters from its flanks, Pray that my soul may live to see Joy springing from this trinity; For all its flower and fruit must be My heritage of thanks. Come closer, brother! Clasp her hand. The while they fallâthese grains of sandâ I am a monarch whose command Evokes a swift consent. When I am dead, and on my mound Daisies and drops of rain abound, Remember me as one who found In sacrifice content. Ah, surely, having birds and shades And dewy violets in the glades Which, stolen from their dark green blades, May sweeten Laura's lace, You will at eve when upward springs The glory of her voice that rings More clearly than the skylark sings Forgive my honoured face. And if the years be stern or mild Pour out upon my widowed child A love almighty, undefiledâ This is the wage I crave! And sometimes (for I shall be dead) Oh, let her come with roses red! And on the cross above my head Carve this to keep my grave:â He sang a simple forest song; To him the day was never long Amid the blooms and feathered throng He loved with all his heart: He took the hand he knew was pure; He preached the faith he felt was sure; God taught him how he should endure And gird him to depart. Our FatherâAh, I cannot seeâ Forgive our trespasses as we Forgive in memory of Theeâ A bird! She sings my knell! O wealth of rapture all too late, My little lyre, the spoil of fate, To speechlessness is consecrate! Laura, my love, farewell! LATE-COMING. Then, like a dove descending, from her eyes Came Love, and sank upon my anxious breast: 'Twas strange in him to leave his paradise And deep blue mansions in serener skies To flutter down, the answer of my cries, And makeâso late, so lateâmy heart his nest! Shall I all rudely hewn and all unmild Rock him and lull him that he please to stay? O heavy hands, be tender with the child! Tho' lacking purple pillows softly piled I know a heart can house him, strong and wild, A heart to break when he shall wing away! LOVE. Love that is love Defies all rule and measure; Love that is love Is time and life and treasure And peace and pain And restlessness and leisure; But not, poor fool, A sweet perpetual pleasure! PERVERSITY. In the yellow pit Of a rose's heart, Half hid from view A diamond shone That was made of dew! But none had wit To want the stone That flashed apart, Alight, alone, In the yellow cup Of a rose's heart. But silver vein And mass of gold With endless pain And toil untold They strove to win For years and years, That they might reap A crop of tears. [They gamble in that house, my friend] âSome rhymster it may be whose bitter pen Shall pay them their mudstains with interest again.â They gamble in that house, my friend, And gamble, too, with lives So anxious do they seem to turn Their daughters into wives! They shuffle with men's hopes and hearts, And mark the game with tears; And trifle with the love that soils Or sanctifies our years. The gamblers sit and subtly stake With false united cares Sweet Delia, dancing in the hall, And Daphne, on the stairs: And if so be that Love is poor In land and golden sheaves They play against his poverty, With long suits up their sleeves. Ah, friend, when Daphne's lips confessed Beneath the moonlit may; And that rare bosom rose and sank, More eloquent than they, You took her face between your hands, And, gazing in her eyes, Said, Daphne, you are Eve, and all This garden Paradise. Ah, lovers' songs and lovers' sighs And lovers' golden lute! Ah, where's an Eden serpentless, With unforbidden fruit? Sir Plutus with his money-bags Soon jingled her away Whose beating heart was close to yours Beneath the moonlit may! Of all the plots that ever thrive By lying, sword, or dart Thrice-cursed be those some mothers make To burst, and break a heart! Small marvel, friend, that you should write A truth my spirit shares:â The while I slept (Ah Love, my Love!) An enemy sowed tares! My dog, tho' kennelled for a year, Had not forgot so soon; A baby, sobbing for its ball, Or crying for the moon! I will not herd with little hearts That barter smiles for pelfâ God keep me from such narrow ways A world unto myself! Could you believe that, as it were, In ashes and in rags, These plotters would have had me cheat Sir Plutus Money-bags? Sir Plutus with his front of brass Was yet too fine a clay To take the shape of hands that broke My branch of moonlit may! And so they would have had me hurl The king from out her heart! But should I stab him with a blade Of which I knew the smart? No! She shall see me in her home And from her husband's breast, Where mischief-makers trouble not And weary, she shall rest! They played with tools of sharpest edge, And when they found them keen Imagined I would be the knaveâ A dirty go-between! But Daphne, shrinking from their kiss And honeyed words, was sure My life would cast out love to keep A conscience nobly pure. They gamble in that house, my friend, And gamble, too, with lives, So anxious do they seem to turn Their daughters into wives! They try to measure hopes and hearts Like inches, feet, and yards; And wince not if they chance to find A blood-stain on the cards! Friends of a June no longer June, To you it has occurred To whip a dreamer from his dreams, And stir his singing-bird. For red-rose days in dumb years dead Your payment is a wrong; So, in his larger charity, He pays you with a song! DESPAIR. Ah, when I think that all is gone, Thy presence and thy comforting, I would my soul were as a stone The urchin drops into a springâ A stone to sink and not again Feel the boy's hand or break the rain! I would renounce my lease of mind, And be a fruitless garden-clod Too base for maids on me to find The simplest blossom of their God. O that I ever thought or loved, Hoped, and so melancholy proved! A DRINKING SONG. There's an inch or so's canary In the bottom of the cup, So, my comrades, pass it round to me again! I can quaff till Dawn is coming With her rosy cheeks, and humming As she flits across the vineyards in the plain. Drink, fine fellows! Rare wine mellows Pith And sinew, Brawn And thews! Nought of foreign's In your goblets Save Aurora's slender dews! There's a health or so for pledging Ere the channel of the cup Runs as dry as thrifty streamlets in the heat. Let us pray the summer vintage To be prodigal of mintage That shall jingle in our hearts and heads and feet! Drink, fine fellows! Rare wine mellows Pith And sinew, Brawn And thews! Nought of foreign's On your whiskers Save Aurora's slender dews! STREPHON TO CHLORIS. Chloris, unbend that gathered brow! 'Twas but a straying touch or twain That followed on this slope of snow The azure runnel of a vein! Come, sweet, be neither saint nor shrewâ The heart behind the hand was true. Now had I stormed thy garter-knot I would not christen thee unkind! But nought of pure hath been forgot, So kiss me, dear, and change thy mind. Be nun-like nowâI care no groat So I am shepherd for thy throat!</field>
