      <field name="fulltext">THE SEAMAN'S CHILDREN. âThe seas have made more orphans than the wars.â Such words the widow Mary Barton said: Whose husband perished on the coast of gold Six years ago, sea-captain of a brig. And bitterly she looked upon her son And daughter at some pastime on the lawn, Resuming, âLord of land and sea, behold How bitter is the portion of my days. My hands are weary with forsaken toil: And all my soul is broken with my care. Thou, Thou canst smooth the trouble of my years Like troubled waves in Galilee: restore That sense of joy and purpose in the earth, That strength in weakness, resolute to face The tears beyond in all nobility, Which light the tender forehead of the bride Who leaves the porch and hears her marriage-bells. There on her husband's arm the future glows In avenues of splendour, glorified With mighty blossom, and sweet stately joys. Ay me, the picture! âCan the waves restore The cold dear hand whose ring is on my own So wasted? there the still and noble brow Sleeps under sea-weed forests; coiling stems To which the upper turmoil of the storms Is but a lazy motion, and great fish Are nested in their branches. âHusband, love, Sustain me in the thought that thou art near In spirit, let me feel thy watchful eyes Upon me in my narrow trivial cares. Let me consider, that the meanest thing, A mother's love devises for her child, To keep the burthen of her widowhood As much as may be from the innocent face That laughs all day into her desolate eyesâ Ascends an incense, more than prayer, to touch The eternal throne. âAnd these my children thrive, I thank high grace that these my children thrive; I trust the years have made them good and fair, For these have nearly put their childhood by. And he, my son, must face the perilous world, And learn to trust himself, and keep his heart Simple as childhood to the evil smile Of ill suggestion; wearing like a charm The thought of home to shield him in the hour When rule and maxim are but shattered reeds. He shall not waver in his loyal soul: Until his merchant masters, testing out His faithful ways and more than youthful trust, Shall give the keys of thousands of his hands. And she my girl remains when he is gone, Our days will not be lonely, nor unsweet In comforting each other; and in time She too shall leave me for the sacred bond And take her matron duty in her turn, To bring hereafter nurselings of her love To warm, before I die, my ancient lips With baby kisses, till I nearly dream I hold again their mother on my knee.â So ending called her children, for the shrubs Were dewed, and night prevailed about the sky, Save that one orange ember-cloud was moved In cold and olive twilight. Mary kissed Her children as they entered: and the three Sat earnest in a parliament of love On William and his fortunes half the night, And all his large success that was to be. And still they talked, until they came to plan The ways and means of spending to the best This wealth colossal but unrealised; Half fearing the responsibilities Of phantom wishes and of fairy gold. Till their lean candle, lower than its ring, Lay gasping out its melancholy life, And sent them flushed with fancy to their rest; Where still the gentle sister in her dream, Mixing the Sunday lesson with their talk, Dreamt that she saw her brother set on high, Like one of old in Egypt, but he gave The people from his sacks not corn but gold. But with the spreading morrow chance secured An answer and an omen to her dream; For as they walked at noon-day in the close Of that cathedral city near their home, And trod the crisp turf of the minster square, And loitered in the archway's dusty cool; And watched the cloister restless with the swift, And heard its little scream-note, as it flash'd Among the weathered faces of grim saints, And mythic flowers that only bloom in stone. Here as they walked they came upon a friend, And kinsman, second cousin or the like, Whose brother was a man of mighty means, Banker and merchant in the inmost smoke Of London: but the poorer brother dwelt Of choice among the fields in indolence, And farmed a little homestead to pretend An occupation; but his drowsy life Was eaten to the core with slothful days; He shuddered at the touch of energy, As some bent sallow's limp and flaccid leaves Shudder and trail about the current's edge. And something came upon the widow's mind To speak, and move this easy-natured drone To make his wealthy brother take her son As clerk, or what he would, into his house. Were they not both her kinsmen and the lad's? But he, annoyed at her still vehement voice And earnest iteration, and the vast Pathetic human passion of her eyes, Shrunk back into his shell of apathy; As the snail shrinks when its nice tentacles Retractile light with hateful substances. Yet still the mother voice importunate Beat on his armour of reserve, until He promised everything to be at rest From her emotion, jarring on his mood; And thought one letter penned a slender price To be again as he had been, before Her serious voice, among his easy dreams. Long was the week they waited for reply, And longer yet another. No result Or answer: till the widow, in suspense Of failure for her paper embassage, Became down-hearted: till the summer filled With fuller green the spaces of the boughs, The skies were softer, and the grass in flower; When Agnes, on a still and crystal morn When the trees smoked with dew, and all the hills Were glazed in tremulous distance; early-risen Laid in her mother's fingers as she slept The letter with the mighty city's mark Above the latticed wax of busied men. The widow read it with dim eyes: it ran Coldly and to the point in some few lines, From the great banker. âThat he counted not The bond of kinship binding him to fill The idle hands of kinsmen. Boys and girls Talk love and marry, live from hand to mouth, Have children more than CrÅsus could maintain, And throw them on the parish of the world. He would not take the boy for cousinship, Yet, since a clerk was wanted, he might come. The boy would find such treatment as the rest, Nor worse nor better, but if he required A special favour, in the counting-house He will not find it: he must stay at home.â Thus the hard man: but long the widow's heart Revolted at his insolent charity, His heartless and didactic opulence; But still her son was dearer than her pride. So wrote the banker humble thanks, and told Her children all was settled for the best, And William in a week must face his toil. So went the women drooping to their cares Of preparation: otherwise the lad: The word to go was music to his heart; And the great voice of labour came to him From some delicious land and city of dreams The more delicious since it was unknown. The instinct of the swallow hardly fledged A month ago, that never flew beyond The practice flights about its native eave, To make the sea its pathway to the sun. Then through the tenor of their household calm Throbbed for a week the turmoil of farewell; Familiar hands to touch, and haunts to tread In greeting ere he go: neglected things Prized in a sudden value at the end, And last the bared room and the boxes closed, And one more walk together in the fields. When Mary held her son's hand all the way And hardly spoke for fear that she should weep; As all the land was waste before her eyes, And the rich river-eases black with drought; The corn-stem seemed all strengthless for its ear, And weary with its wavings in the sun. And still she found a sorrow where she went; And a faint burden in the broken stirs And eddies of an irritable wind: In clouds that lay in ruinous heaps before The disc of evening, cold with bosomed rain: In faded masses of the summer green, Like the grey hairs that come before their time. But William went at day-break: one cold kiss To Agnes, and his mother at the gate, As, shivering with their sorrow and the air Of morn, they came to watch him climb the mail; Another moment and their boy was gone Far in the dusty whirl that rose behind The clattering team: and then the women wept Without restraint, and all the house was still: And all that day they crept from room to room As if that some one in the house lay dead. And William stinted not at first to write Whole reams of wonders from the giant town, âThis was the place for every one to thrive: He could not think how any soul remained To till the country, when the world's great mart Lay wide for all; whose mighty river's side Garner'd the wealth of empires on its wharves, And reapt in gold the harvest of the earth.â But after certain months more seldom came His letters, and less hopeful. She, that kept Them all, comparing with the first these last, Became uneasy; and besought her son, Writing from time to time without avail, To tell her all his grief, if grief he knew. But the boy fought it off in his replies, Evading or ignoring all she said. And to increase her evil days there grew A trouble touching Agnes, her meek child, Who never gave her troubled thought before. For so it chanced a rustic flower-show near Had drawn their steps; where, in a steamy booth Of low hot canvas, ranged elaborate rows Of painful dahlias blown by line and rule, And petall'd to a hair's-breadth intricate: Where pear and pippin, bean and cauliflower, Turnip and melon, herb and artichoke, As Mieris drew them, spread from door to door. And all the place smelt hot of trodden grass, And a band throbbed outside at intervals. Here as they walked they came on Edward Mayne, Son of a wealthy neighbour baronet: Successful too at college lately, he, All things to all men, smoothly affable, Could turn his hand to anything he chose, Scan a Greek chorus or break in a horse. But evil tales were current in the shire Against him: and the mother's instinct feared Seeing his eyes on Agnes: and the girl Flushed at his notice not displeased, as he Found pretext in the pushing of the crowd To do some service and to speak some words, Trivial enough, if he meant nothing more. But Agnes met him afterwards by chance, By chance she thought it, in the maple lane A furlong from her threshold: the low sun Full in her face: a gloom of woods beyond, And glistenings on the pasture and the cloud. But he with an assumed and faltering mien, Beginning in a snaky deference, As he that in the new world tempted Eve, So wrought upon her nature, tone by tone; The man of subtle brain and selfish aim, Of large experience, wealth, and intellect, Acting the scholar to a country girl To touch the woman instinct vanity; Mysterious mainspring of that intricate heart Divine in weakness, that indwelling flaw, Fault-like, that moves in nobly-natured men Forbearance, but is pastime to the fiends. After a while he left her dazed and strange, With the new purple breaking on her eyes Of love's horizon, depths of crystal dawn, Aurorean, limpid, purer than a dream: Mistrust should never stain that amber sky, Or stay the fuller morning yet to be. So tremulous home she went: yet could not tell Her mother: wherefore tell her? Was she sure As yet that she had anything to say? Yet duty whispered tell her. So she told Half, that he met her merely; but withheld The serpent words at whose delicious tone Her hands were trembling still, like delicate chords Wrought by the wind to music. Mary heard Sadly, the mother heard exceeding pale, Her eyes with love and anguish eloquent, And reached her eager arms about her child, And spake impetuous love, âNo, Agnes, no, My tender child, my best and innocent dove, Let this at least be spared my widowed days; I do not think that God can mean so much Of desolation for us; but beware: There is no thing more pitiful on earth Than one weak creature with a wounded heart. Believe, my girl, all love impossible Between you; now believe it, ere one word Of love is spoken, easier: but if chance Hereafter, God forbid it! make you hear Such words of Edward Mayne, believe he lies And mocks the sacred passion with false lips, As false to you, as false elsewhere before. His house is proud and noble, we are poor: He could not, if he would, mean well by you, The seaman's daughter could not sit a bride Beneath the ancestral portraits of his line: The seaman's daughter is too good and proud To be the mistress of his idle hour.â But Agnes answered nothing save the old Womanly answer of a flood of tears. But Mary judged it kinder to speak out In time and harshly: for she feared the man Exceedingly, and fainted in her soul, Remembering all the trouble she had known. And Agnes passed in silence to her rest. But could not sleep and set her casement wide. The air was very slow, the clouds came not, One leaned and faltered in the stagnant night. Her mother's words were cruel and unjust; She thought unjust to him, unjust to her She knew them: mothers hardened with their years, Believed in nothing save in commonplace: And yet romance was current in the world, Marring the calculations of the old; And there were flowers and April, spite of prose That only saw the winter of the earth. How could her mother judge of Edward Mayne? She heard the farmer tattle on the great, And took it all for gospel: Was there one As noble or as handsome that escaped The housewives' gossip? Granting that he meant The half he said, that little he had said Was mended easily, no mischief done. Her life was lonely with her brother gone: And must she mope in-doors all day, from fear Of meeting some one in the lanes, who talked A pleasant twenty minutes at her side? And thus the touching arrogance of youth Believed its special dream divinely true Thro' all exceptions of recorded wrong And all the hackney'd falsehood, day by day, Scored to the devil's credit in this world. But on that night and at that very hour, When Agnes leant into the fragrant dark And thought upon him, Edward Mayne at home Sat with a comrade late into the night Beside their wine; talked freely, and forgot The varnish and the smooth conventional mask He wore before the steady-going world; And the men talked their natures, friend to friend: But Edward railed in heartless ironies At all things, sparing nothing, crushing down The sanctuaries of thought and ritual. Cheapening man's soul, and carping at the scheme Of nature, praising nothing save the power To see the utter worthlessness of all. Until his comrade, better of the twain, Grew half impatient at his ironies, And said in banter, âTell me any thing That you believe in, this perpetual blame Is grown monotonous, try another key.â And Edward answered with an evil smile, âBelieve in nothing? Oh, I believe in much. I do believe it were an infinite sport, To follow the first pretty girl we meet In some quaint quiet village of the land, That looks demure enough about the lips To give a zest of trouble to the thing; And fill her head with all the trash boys use, Half pirated from novels, half believed, About eternal passion, adding scraps Of Byron, sound and words and common forms. Flash on her with your money and fine clothes, Make her despise the contrast of her home; And charm her with elaborate display Of surface manners, airy courtesies, Which one, thank God, a gentleman can use For his own purpose and put off at will: And these poor girls dote on a gentleman: They miss his polish in their kindred boors, Brothers and shopmen suitors. She is yours After a little trouble, if you add The fear of compromise. Play out the dream And leave it: there is nought on this poor earth So worth the trouble: your philosopher, Give him his chance, is childish as a child Before the snare of passion. To the winds His books and papers, if he thinks a girl, A mere child waiting with an April face, Would, if he came not, weep some shallow tears: Can thinking on the fossil and the star Suffice the man, or weed his nature out? His best ambition is but as the clown's, If his pride loses this, he loses all.â And as they talked the sultry air began To stir itself for sunrise: the large woods Were crisp and cloudy, ere the crystal grew, Upon the olive-shadow'd ridge beyond In sacred dawn upon an evil world. But Agnes slept, and in her peaceful rest No angel whisper'd caution to her dream. And days went on, and Agnes' walks became A thing of custom now with Edward Mayne. And, since the first, she had not dared to tell Her mother: and one evening at their meal, Had Mary with unreal carelessness, But anxious for an answer at her heart, Touched upon Edward, asked, had he been seen Lately? whereon her daughter, unprepared To break it then, and flustered, all confused, Denied that she had seen him, hurriedly, Of instinct more than forethought, and before She well knew what she said, or what to say: But in her lonely chamber afterwards Wept somewhat at the falsehood told, but thought The mother's asking chiefly blameable. The vital airs of summer, her light gleams, Were failing in the red October's gray: The few last petals of the latest flowers Were stain'd and stricken with a living doom. The torn nest's ragged shreds in the bare thorn, The iron look about the gusty fields, Told that another summer of the world Ended, had turned another hair to gray Upon the forehead of Eternity. And winter deepened, and the widow's woes Deepened with winter. William silent long Had written from the bank a hasty scrawl, Unlike himself, and begged impetuously For money to stave off some pressing needs: Indeed she could not send him all he sought: She sent him half, and added piteous prayers That he should trust her: she had right besides, A mother's, to be trusted: what was wrong? Mere debt was evil curable with time: He must come home, retrench with them, resign His clerkship, if needs be, start fair again With new experience in a year or more. But neither thanks nor answer came to this: She wrote again more urgently: again A week of silence. Lastly, in despair And terrified for William utterly, With hasty preparation came herself To London; and, because she doubted much To take the girl or leave her, Agnes stayed With one a neighbour chancing at the time To have no children of her own at home. And now the widow, after many years, At night-fall, worn and jaded, stood again Among the labyrinths of humanity, A stranger to the mighty city's ways. And the low restless never-ceasing flow, The radiation of a myriad threads Of purpose, toiling round her, made her pause And falter in her journey, with a dazed Sense of her utter insignificance; As if her individual agony Were nothing in this chaos of the world. And the sleet fell, and the street gases flared, Angry, tenacious of their life against The gust surprisals: but she struggled on And asked her way, in patience resolute, Until she reached the street, and found the door, And read the brasses with her kinsman's name, But all was barr'd, and banking hours were done. And so in utter weariness she turned Her patient face again upon the night To seek some shelter till the day should come. It chanced an ancient porter of the bank Had seen her feeble hand upon the door, Her evident trouble and her rainy clothes; Who came in kindness after her, and learnt Her name and whom she sought for. He, kind man, Knowing some further evil of her son, Because he could not break it in the street, Put off her question vaguely, yet besought That she would rest awhile, or, if she chose, The night at his poor lodging, where his wife Would tell her more than he could: so she went. And here that honest couple tenderly Softened as best they might the bitter news, Which came in brief to this; that now ten days Her son had not been heard of at the house, And that another clerk had gone with him; And there were missing monies of the bank Not much in totalâ But the widow heard No longer, for a darkness on her brain Swept out her world of sorrow, and her sense Failed, and the old wife saw her slipping down And caught her; and she nursed her senses back, And laid her in a quiet chamber, bare And homely, still her best one; chafed her hands, Sat by the bed-side all the night, and heard The low continual sobbings all night long, So tended her till daybreak patiently: Till the new light smote on the stricken face Like anodyne, and then the widow slept. Strengthened she woke: the trouble still was there, But she was stronger now to reason it And do the best: there would be time to weep Enough hereafter: something yet remained, And still one child was worthy of her love. First would she see the banker: she was bound To see him, hear him, thank him; at the least Bear his rich scorn with fortitude, and shew That if her son has faltered, so not she, âThat one at least is honest of his kin: The house is honest if the son is lost. And I will see this kinsman, and endure His scornful eyes to tell him to his face, That last of all the poor man loses pride, Much we have lost, still lords of honest pride; And honour is not sealed in bags of gold; That I, too proud to beg for honesty, Will never beg for wrong, and scorn to screen A felon, though that felon be my son.â And so she faced the fog and oozy ways, And found the man of money in his hold, His Mammon citadel, and palace of dustâ For this god loves not gewgaw shows, prefers Stained walls foursquare and cobwebs for his house Of adoration.âHere the banker sate Hedged in with mighty ledgers, and around The iron boxes lettered with great names, And parchment piles: and ever from beyond The glass division came a clink and crash, And battering down of bags and shovelled gold, Or turn of crisping note-sides one by one. He hardly raised his eyelids as she came, Shewed no surprise, no anger, merely chill And hard indifference: pausing in his words With insolent precision, he began, âMadam, you come to make a scene of tears, To beg the boy from justice, whom I took Into my trust from idiot charity, One who has well repaid me: I account Myself both rightly served in this, and more Befall me, if I ever take again A mother's commendation of her child As worth an empty nut-shell: my resolve Is to go through with this and track him out: Shall I cheat justice as he cheated me? And you will see the reason of my course, And take a quiet answer. For yourself I hold you clear of all, extend my hand To shew I do not shirk our distant kin; But the less said between us of the lad The better now and always.â Thus he flowed, In secret triumph that his charity, To one who ill repaid it, warranted Henceforth a rigid abstinence in alms: And made the man determine with himself To sin no more against his wealth again, Nor vex his idol more. Then Mary touched Her kinsman's hand and answered, âIf the lad I trained in honest training at my knee Has faltered from his honourable trust, Then were I worst of Christians in this world, Demanding mercy in our kindred name. I do not think to speak for such a one If I were more than mother to his shame, And you the nearest of my house in blood. Make only certain that this thing is done, Then will I thank you for his punishment.â So she replied, and left him at his desk, Returning to her bare and vacant room; And still her eyes were steady in the street To all who met her, and it bore her up, Not to have wept before his hard grey eyes And calculating forehead: still she thought, âMy duty I have spoken, not my heart: And I am braver than the thing I knew.â So gained her dwelling, where the woman broke Her self-command and sobbed upon her hands; Accusing all her harshness of the day, And wailing that she had not cast her length On the bank's dusty floors, and knelt to him, And wrung a pardon from the stern old man. But she had done her duty: still remained A daughter to her love. Hereafter all Her life should be her daughter's: she would leave This town of all misfortune: she might feel Her sorrow less in the sweet country airs, And she was fevered for the sight of home, And Agnes' voice about her in the room. Therefore, her scanty preparations made, She left the porter's kindly room, and set Her face to leave the city: but, because The crowded ways at noontide hinder'd her, She stood upon the pavement waiting time To cross a waggon-crowded thoroughfare; A gaudy carriage grazing through the throng Went by, all brass and lacquer, to the speed Of lofty-going horses, as they sent The mire to right and left among the crowd; And then the widow raised her eyes, and saw Within the carriage seated side by side Agnes, her daughter once, and Edward Mayne. That night a message reached the porter's wife, To come at once in charity and speed To some poor woman in the hospital Brought nameless in that forenoon from the street, Who named her as her only friend in town. And who in certain hours would be beyond The reach of friendship: and the porter's wife Went on the instant, knowing in her mind That this must be the widow; and her tears Flowed as she went. But Mary Barton lay In the last ward; and night was on the place. And now she moaned a little, now she spake, But did not know the woman at her side. After an hour a change possessed her face, And made her speech impetuous at the last. âMerciful God, up with Thy saints in Heaven, Who gavest me my children to my breast, Beautiful baby faces, innocent: Thine hours increased in strength their strengthless hands, Which I have joined and made them hear me pray, And take at least the attitude of prayer, Till their young sense could for itself ask Heaven. âMerciful God! is evil in the wind, Is evil in the pure beam on the grass? I cannot find contagion in my love, That only thought to rear them good and pure: They found not any falsehood in the fields: I shewed them pictures from the sacred Book. How is it they are gone the evil way? How have they chosen darkness for the sun? âToo young and bright for shame, too young for shame: She gave me trouble too, a weakly child. I nearly lost her twice in cradle days, And prayed, and prayed, that she might live to me. Fool, blind, to meddle with the ways of God: O Lord, undo the past, and strike her dead Here at my breast: so better, there, let be: Straighten the limbs, and kiss the small dead face; And I will put her in a little grave, Deep in the mould, where this same horrible dream Of shame shall never reach or find her out. âYes, children come to deathbeds; but for mine I do not think to see them any more. I know them they are hard and mercenary: They will not even come to see me die. They might have done this, and have done with me: They lay in mine no comfortable hand, Give me no lipsâone touch for the old days: I loved them then, they do not love me now. They love not me, or God, or anything. Who trained them up to this? O God, not I! âNay, this is not my son, his clothes are fine: There is a new look grown about his eyes Since he left home: he speaks not like my boy: My son would never laugh so in his shame. Although an angel told me this is he, Should I believe that angel? Yet I know That I am very weak and very near My end, and cannot sunder false from true. Nay, Lord, Thou knowest my burthen is not light. Thou wilt not be extreme to mark, if I Have faltered with immeasurable load. I would bear up, but on my heart is spread A numbness, and my limbs are weak as dust: And, I believe, thou call'st me to Thy rest. âThere is a sickly thought which comes and goes: I have forgot its meaning, but I know, When I have seen it standing at my bed, How greatly best it is that I should die; For something has been lost upon the earth Which, I suppose, I could breathe without.â And, as she spake, the great concluding hand Touched her sharp face: the voice fell, and the eyes Looked strangely for a moment. In that pause Of seconds time had ended in a heart Of infinite emotion: infinite rest, Sudden and vast, came; as the sudden day Brake in the hospital; and her kind friend Looked towards the bed and then knelt down by it, Seeing an orient silence on the face, To which all now was even in the world, Sorrow and mirth, and blame and recompense. PALINGENESIS. I The sacred earth in her delight Steams under April's wheeling sun. The kingcup spreads his amber might, The clouds in triumph melt and run, And nimble titlarks flock in sight. II And here and there a piercing bud, The herald of the costlier year, Folds sweet the warmth within its blood, And strengthens out each petal clear. The flushed merle screams about the wood. III The shower is sweet upon the ground. Smooth-headed robins ruffle out Their plumage. Spring, in every sound Divine and sudden, sheds about Her green dilation at a bound. IV The sap in old blind things is warm'd: The eager palm outruns its leaves: The tufty birches, silver-armed, Lie coiling on their crystal eaves: Comes peering crocus turf-embalmed. V The larch blushed out at finger tips: They say love-whispers of the spring Ran through her fibre on the lips Of March winds, heard like falling ring Of rain-drops down the bladed slips. VI And daffodils hold the snow-drops' room, Like amber flashes on the sea, The treasure of the violet's gloom Dividing with her. Can it be, Those steady purples, aspen bloom? VII O glory of the dim green bough, O April floors of primrose zone: It seems as if the gray world now Had done for ever all her moan Of raving winds and barren snow. ACIS TO GALATEA. The lonely burthen of a purple cloud: The peaks of Ãtna tremulous between The disunited vapour: zone on zone The girdling vineyard: and, beyond, the blue Of long Tyrrhenian waters with their isles Of old HephÃ¦stus, where the rosy space Of ether draws to olive depth, or holds The gate of light in violet waves of fire. O let me hear thee speak, that I may feel This mighty dream is real as the touch Of thy sweet hand that calms me. Bend thine eyes With all their light and spirit into my brain, And make thy lips assurance yet once more, Lest I should fear delusion, and awake Hereafter weeping for a phantom joy. What have I done that thou should'st love me so, Immortal as thou art? Unworthy I To kneel before thy rosy feet, or touch The cistus they have broken on our cliffs, Or press the thymy clusters in thy track, And feign a double fragrance from thy tread. Wonder of Eros, this and thus was I, The dull mute thing whose weakness at thy face Fell prone in adoration; nor endured Thy glance, whose thrill brake on him like a fire And dazed his feeble nature down in pain. Marvel of love, how altered, late so low; Since thou hast deigned to raise me, as a cloud Is sucked into the glories of the sun, Earthborn in heavenly ardours lost and veiled. Thy love is like a silence of warm air: And more than all monotony of sound To feel thy spirit brooding in serene Completeness, deep as noon and pure as heaven. Beyond all glory then to see thee rise And soothe my burning forehead with thine hand: Or, in caress, thread back thy heavy locks Disordered; leaning in a silent care To smile before thy lips are moved to mine, Lest I should lose thy smile, as men have lost From over-nearness some exceeding light: So leaning, drink my spirit into thine, With thy sweet arm about me, and between A murmuring breath in whisper, like the talk Of mated swallows when their nest is laid. Oh, but to take thy softness in these arms, And weave delirious kisses, like a God: And kiss and thirst more kisses, this were wine As never yet Silenus in his dream Pressed at the vine of Hellas: so to dwell Thy serious eyes upon me, so to dream And dream, as Gods have dreamt, the stately joy That makes our years immortal. So thy voice Should give me sweetest breath, as asphodel From meadows where the mighty hearts have made Heroic calm for always. Whisper me In living silence: thy smooth cheek on mine: And let thy ringlet flakes efface the day, With clustered ripples from my glowing eyes. And so remain as radiant as of yore, Mysterious in thy beauty; hold thine arms About thine Acis, till this mortal heart Dissolve to equal thine, and pulse with thine In larger beatings, as a God's that loves,â And take arterial ichors for the stream Of puny life within him. Till he drain Enormous inspiration from thy lips, And be divine as thou, for surely they That love are equal; and thy love shall draw My faltering soul, invested with thy power, Beyond the limit of our ebbing years, To larger cons than the breed of clay Consume, before their children bind their urn A year or twain with garland: children's eyes Weep nothing long, and these shall put away The old man's thought, to reap in turn their joys, In turn forgot as though they had not been. Forgive, divinest, this my mortal thought. I question not beyond thee. Love is more Than time: thine eyes are on me, and thy palm Is wound with mine: thy lucid orbs resume Old tenderness, and wean me from the thought Beyond thine arms: thy love is more than all Hereafter: leave me this, that I may hear The breathings of thy bosom, hear thy sighs, Drawn out in sweet suppression from thy soul, To tell me more than language all thy love. Leave this, I question not while this endure: Enough as now to linger, so to watch The wave, the vineyard, and the flaky heads Of Ãtna, slendered up in amber sky. RUTH AND LUCY, OR CROSS-PURPOSES. A winding lane of elder, hip, and sloe, Led to the thatcher Abel Nixon's home: A cottage squared in white and beamed in dark, A bee-hive and a dahlia row beyond, A cornered croft with twisted apple-trees, A field-gate to the right and one bar gone; The near ground poached and roughened by the hooves Of lazy crowded pasture-going beeves: Pasture on pasture laid until the verge, And nothing nearer heaven than hedge or tree: A shire of milk as even as a mere. Now Abel Nixon had one daughter Ruth, And fostered up a niece beside his child; And made her as a daughter in his home. For he had pledged his sister near her death That he would love the child and shelter it. But Lucy Moore was elder of a year Than Ruth: and these together in one nest, Each orphan of her mother, throve and grew. And now the tranquil, secret influence Of day and year and season, like the air And wind and sunny blue that set the bud, Moulded the cottage maidens, like a dream, Into the fragrant germ of womanhood. The farmer of the pastures at their door Was Andrew Eden: Andrew Eden's son, Not less was Andrew: Lucy Moore had been His foster-sister, for the mother died After his birth, so Lucy's rear'd the child; Since she was poor, and wedded to a man As constant to the alehouse as its sign. And Andrew in the autumn ploughed the fields, And Andrew sowed the seed in early spring; But, fall or seed-time, ever at his task His face was turning towards the cottage door: The flutter of a garment stopped his team, The glitter of an arm withheld his hand, And left a sterile patch to tell its tales Among the coming harvest's reedy crowd. So after Sunday service in the porch He loitered anxious, near the mounded rests Of those who loitered as he loitered now, Poor hearts of mould, in their day: with as warm An expectation, and as deep a throb, When their young loves stept from the porch of prayer With rare and lucid morning in their eyes. And so perchance would Andrew, if he dared, For his young love was fearful as a hare That trembles at the grating of dead leaves, Walk side by side with Lucy and with Ruth; And hold their church-books for them by the way, And see them to the cottage garden gate Ere he was fully master of his tongue. So on a week-day often with pretence His beasts had strayed, or that his fences stood Unmended on the apple orchard side, He would contrive to see them day by day: And what he mended of his fence by day, As often he would pull it down at night That he might come and mend it up again; Like the old dame of story at her web. Silently coming under silent stars He heard the hedges heavy with the wind: As the low morning with a hint of dawn Drew right and left the leaning clouds, an hour Before the real sunrise branched in rose. He saw the gleamy casement where she slept: And if among the creepers of the wall A moth, with moon-light wakened, flustered out, His heart became a vocal tremulous chord Of agonized vibration. The moved shade Of foliage on the rafters made him stoop Behind the bushes fearing to be known, Or sent him creeping like a felon home. Now Andrew's heart was wholly bent on Ruth; But since he talked with Lucy more than Ruth, With her he loved not more than her he loved, From that excessive tenderness and awe With which his fancy had environed Ruth: And since that he, more wholly at his ease With Lucy, talked to Lucy, looked at Ruth; It came in very truth the girls believed That Lucy was his sweet-heart: she herself Believed it; and the perfect sister love Of Ruth, in Lucy's welfare chiefly blest, Strove that their suit should prosper: since she knew Andrew was good and gentle, one to make Her Lucy happy. Bitter at the first Had this thing been to Ruth with all her love For Lucy; Ruth had guess'd not how she cared For Andrew till she fancied he had made His choice in Lucy: then since love denied Is bitter always, though a dearest hand Reap in our own misfortune; for a time She lost the light and colour in her cheek: But patiently she conquered it at last And nobly beat it down; in nobleness Indignant at her weakness, for she mused, âShall sister be to sister traitress then, Shall I, the next to him of all the world, In love and trust with Lucy, come between And spoil it all in utter selfishness? And reap myself, save hatred, no reward At either of their hands whom I would slave A lifetime long to prosper.â When she found That she was wholly mistress of herself, She went to Lucy, and she kissed her brow, And took her hand and talked of Andrew then; And how that she would come and live with them When they were man and wife, aid in the house And tend the children. Then and afterwards The girls would talk together in this strain: And neither doubted Lucy should be wed To Andrew in the bloomy days to be. And so the journey of the world went on, Until a day when Lucy and when Ruth Gathered a harvest in the orchard grass Of apple and of damson: overnight The gale had strown them: Andrew too was there Upon some pretext: and by chance it came That Lucy went away into the house, And Ruth and Andrew gathered on alone. Then suddenly a power upon his heart, A strange constraining impulse vehement, Like the fierce flash of sun-fire on a day Of fleeting showers and wild alternate lightsâ Made him speak out abruptly: though before He came, he had not dreamt to speak to her: But when he looked into her eyes, and found Her eyes so near him, vehement he spoke. âO Ruth, my Ruth, we two have surely been Together many years, whose every day Has only gone to me in this one dream, That one fair noon, like this on which we speak, I might come to you, as I came to-day, And say the thought of yearsâRuth, be my wife!â But as she heard him to the very core She trembled: bitter mist was on her eyes, And something vapour-like swept out the world: As a cloud takes the climber on an Alp, And he is all alone within the cloud Without an inch of vision: so her world Failed from her eyes, Andrew, the orchard, all Withered and was not; yet she heard his voice Still pleading, but it seemed a distant thing That spoke to some one in the far away, Nothing to her and stranger than a dream: Whereon she graspt a low bough at her side In falling: yet she fell not, for the bough Sustained her till the fuller sense of pain Came back; and then the battle of her life Passed in an instant. All her old girl love, Which she had schooled and conquered, flashed and flared And would not be forgotten; when it heard The voice, that first had called it to this world, Telling that only she was dearest now. But still she conquered all for Lucy's sake, And calmly answered him, exceeding pale; âO Andrew, this you shall not speak to me: These words are Lucy's, for her heart is yours. Indeed, if yonder cloud had rained down dust, I should have wondered less, than at your mouth To hear the words I never should have heard. Indeed, believe me, Lucy loves you well. You spoke not much to me before to-day, To Lucy speaking often: how should I Think more about you than an old dear friend? Nothing beyond; but she, I have heard her wake When the gray dawn was on the pane, and call The name of Andrew: I have seen her sit And weep an hour in twilight: is not this True love, or else true love is but a name? âNow therefore let these words of yours to-day Be as unsaid: forget them: you and I Have heard them only: let no mortal soul Hear them of either: they shall never pass My lips, and yours they will not any more. And I entreat you for the love of heaven, By all our ancient kindness that has been About these fields since we were each so young, To try and love poor Lucy in return. For she is worthy this, and worthy more Than any man can give her of his love.â And then she turned and left him where he stood, Fled to the cottage with no word besides, Because she could not further trust herself. And Andrew, dazed and sorrowful, alone Pondered awhile: then homewards, step on step, As slowly went as the laborious team Divides the fallows with their forward toil Of hoof and straining shoulder. He a week Touched not the cottage latch: and more each day The sadness and the strangeness of the thing Perplexed him: he had lost, utterly lost Her love he cared for; but in wooing one Had gained another. Lucy indeed was sweet And gentle: in some sort he loved her too, But not like Ruth who held his love so vile: And Ruth would hate him more, unless he strove To make return to Lucy, as he could, For her devotion. Life indeed he knew Was but the art of bending to the best Familiar evil: he would face his doom, And, for sheer love of Ruth, would try to take Her council in repaying Lucy's love. And now ten days were gone, and Andrew stood Again beneath the twisted orchard boughs. But change had fallen on the happy place, And common light unsplendoured with decay The precincts of its glory. But no change Of sorrow that, which in poor Lucy's eyes Brightened to hail him with an innocent joy After his absence: plain at length he saw How truly Ruth had spoken: in his soul He pitied Lucy: saw her day by day: But Ruth would speak alone with him no more Thereafter: Lucy often was alone With Andrew: till at length he came to think Of Ruth that she must surely love elsewhere: And then his hope fell dead, though sick before. And still the gentle Lucy's plaintive eyes Retold their earnest story to his own: The light pathetic tremor of the hand, More eloquent than speech, assured him well That some one still cared for him in the world; The chance that lost his dearest, gave him this, A gentle heart; why should this also go, Why drag unloved his solitary years? So in a month Lucy and he were wed: But Ruth remained at home and did not come To the altar with them: and they thought her strange And somewhat cold when she would not be there. Henceforward Lucy at her husband's farm Dwelt on: but Ruth remained to keep the house For her old father; querulous was he, Broken with labour, and complainingly Flared out his socket end of feeble years. But Ruth nor failed nor faltered in her love, So tended him with patience: her chief joy Was when at evening Lucy's children ran Across the fields to see her: then Ruth sat And wound them in her arms and told them tales; While large and long the shadows of the leaves Fell on the baby foreheads, as a glow Like rippling waters moved them, and one said, âDear aunt, the sunset fills your eyes with tears.â A WINTER SERENADE. Ere, sweeting, dim November pine Her leaves away at winter's door, Bring thy great eyes across the shine Of yellow gusty woodland floor, And sit thee down by where the squirrel Ascends the stories of his pine. When only redbreast chirps thee on, And fingered chestnut-leaves are hoar: And lately green is come to wan On lime and beech and sycamore; And paths are sown with mast and acorn, And shrew-mice gather winter-store When plovers tremble up to cloud In flights with starling dust bestrown, And redwing nations restless-loud O'er fallows left and right are sown, And labyrinths of tree-branch network Are black on banks of primrose zone. The winds, all summer idly dead, Give prelude to their winter tune: Gray hoar-frost hears them, from his bed Lays out white hands and wakens soon, And laughs, as soughing elm-trees shed Old homes of breeding rooks in June.
