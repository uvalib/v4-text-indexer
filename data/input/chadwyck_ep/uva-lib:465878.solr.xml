      <field name="fulltext">ORIGINAL POEMS AND TRANSLATIONS: Never before Publish'd. By M. D. Bellamy. The Languishing LOVER: OR, An Invocation to SLEEP. A Musical Interlude: SCENE. A Shady Grove. Enter Damon, Thirsis, and Alexis. Da. Rise, Gentle God of SLEEP, Arise, With Downy Slumbers close my Eyes, And give my Restless Thoughts a Kind Reprieve: For whilst my Lovely Celia's gone, I must Her Tedious Absence moan; Without my Better Half 'tis Pain to live. Thyr. Bring here thy Pow'rful, Magic Wand; Close by Poor Damon's Temples stand, And wave it gently o're his slumb'ring Soul: Tho' bound within thy Peaceful Chains, He will be Free from All those Pains, Those Anxious Pains with which his Heart is full. Morpheus rises Half-Asleep. Mor. Ye Gentle Swains, my Aid invoking, Your Faithful Friendship I approve: In Pleasing Slumbers, Dreams provoking, I'll reward Young Damon's Love. Da. Yet tho' I would Thy Captive be, I'd have my Mimic Fancy free, And with an Unconfined Motion rove; And All her Pretty Pastimes play, That She may to my Eyes convey The Dear Idea of the NYMPH I love. Mor. Her Lovely Image soon I'll send, Her Beauties All-displaying; A Thousand Cupids shall attend, And in Her Eyes be playing: (Morpheus waves his Hand over Damon's Head, and descends. Damon falls asleep. Alex. Oh! FANCY, Wakeful Goddess, now Inquire thro' Morpheus' Realms below, For the Dear Treasure of his Heart that's lost: If there the Nymph Thou can'st not find, Yet bring th' Idea to his Mind Of One, that may resemble Celia most. Thyr. But if No Draught be treasur'd there Of One so Exquisitely Fair; Let Fancy paint the Charmer All anew: From every Goddess steal a Grace; Let it be Fancy's Master-piece; Not Fancy's Self can Celia's Charms outdo. Alex. If All her Art shall not avail, (Nor shall I wonder if She fail) To draw a Piece of so much Eminence: Let her Content with Damon rest, 'Till She beholds his Waking Breast; She'll find Her Image never stray from thence. Damon wakes. Da. Oh! Sleep, resume thy feeble Pow'r; Betray my flutt'ring Heart no more, Nor e're pretend to sooth my Cares again: E're Celia shall forsake my Breast, Ne're shall my Eyes incline to Rest, But wake with Endless Joy, in Endless Pain. CHORUS. No more, Ye Swains, no more employ Dull Morpheus' Pow'r to ease your Pain: The Absent Lover's Darling Joy Is still to Wake, and still Complain. CANTATA I. The Presumptuous BEE. Rec. As, on a Sultry Summer's Day, The God of Love went out to play; A Wanton Bee was on the Wing; And touch'd the Stripling with his Sting. Soon as he felt the Raging Pain; He thus to VENUS did complain. Air. See, Mamma, see, How I do swell! See, how the Blood does start! Oh! I can never, never bear The Aching, Raging Smart. A Little Dragon round me flew, Then settl'd on my Breast; His Fatal Sting with Fury drew, And robb'd me of my Rest. Rec. The Queen of Beauty, when She found There was no Danger in the Wound; Found that his Pain was almost gone; Thus with a Smile address'd her Son. Air. If such a Little Animal Can vex my Cupid so; If but a Bee can wound Thee thus, Think what Thy Sting can do. O! Think, my Pretty, Little Boy, How Raging is the Smart, Which the Poor, Slighted Lover feels, When You transfix his Heart. CANTATA II. JUPITER and DANAE: OR, The Power of GOLD. Rec. When Heav'n's Gay God essay'd to move The Chast, Coy Danae to Love, A Thousand Artful Tales He told, But Nothing pleas'd He found like GOLD. Therefore (resolv'd to win the Maid) He chang'd t' a Golden Show'r, and said. Air. O! Lovely Charmer, Beauteous Maid, See, humbly at thy Feet JOVE lies! Thy Mortal Charms transport Him more Than All the Beauties of the Skies. See, Fair One, all this Yellow Flood To Thee I'll give, if Thou'lt comply. O! Do not to a Suppliant GOD His Wish'd for Happiness deny. Rec. The pleasant Prospect look'd so gay, 'Twou'd Chastity Herself betray: Her Virtue soon began to nod, And thus the Maid bespoke the GOD. Air. No more shall Danae to JOVE, Prove like a Vestal Cold: The Shafts of Love resistless are, When tipt with Sacred Gold. CANTATA III. VENUS in Tears for the Death of ADONIS. Rec. As Beauty's Goddess chanc'd to rove Around her Favourite, Shady Grove; Surpriz'd, a While She speechless stood, To find the Grass all stain'd with Blood. But when She cast her Eyes around, And saw Adonis on the Ground, Saw his Deep, Ghastly, Gaping Wound; With hideous Cries She fill'd the Air, And thus express'd her deep Dispair. Air. Ah! Dear Adonis, Lovely Boy, My Soul's Delight, my Only Joy! Since Thee Untimely Fate has slain: (Could I) How freely would I dye! And to thy Parted Spirit fly! For Immortality's a Pain. CANTATA IV. The Agreable MISTAKE: OR, VENUS Discarded. Rec. Within a Shady, Pleasant Grove, By Nature form'd Alone for Love, Asleep the Fair Ophelia laid, While Fanning Cupids round Her play'd. The God of War the Virgin spies, And swiftly thro' the Grotto flies. The Rustling Noise Her Slumbers broke, And thus the GOD the Maid bespoke. Air. Rise, Beauteous Cytharea, Rise, This Happy Hour improve; While Vulcan, and his Smutty Train Are forging Bolts for JOVE: Let us beneath this Shade lye down, And there renew our Flame; Let us, possess'd of Present Joys, Forget our Former Shame. Rec. Ophelia trembl'd when She heard This Amorous Pray'r to Her preferr'd; And, like a Virgin, free from Stain, Repuls'd Her Lover with Disdain. The GOD, un-us'd to be deny'd, In Moving Accents thus reply'd. Air. Why, Lovely Charmer, dost Thou stop The Rapid Current of my Joy? Oh! Whence proceeds this suddain Change? Venus ne're us'd to be so Coy. Rec. Ophelia still maintain'd the Field, And Modestly refus'd to yield; Still strove, and struggl'd to be gone, And fain wou'd from his Arms have run: Tho' proud to be so close pursu'd, And thought a Venus by a GOD. A Thousand Ways Fond Mars essay'd To soften the Relentless Maid: With Many a Sigh He told his Pain, And dropp'd a Thousand Tears in vain: Tho' Sighs and Tears, they say, will move, And pass for Eloquence in Love. At last the Amorous God of War (Unable such Repulse to bear) Resolv'd by Dint of Force to gain What He by Art had sought in vain. Then, like a Soldier, seiz'd his Bliss, And ravish'd from the Fair a Kiss. The GOD all-over Transport, swore Venus ne're charm'd him so before. But when more closely he survey'd This Mortal Beauty, British Maid, Well-pleas'd with His Mistake, He said. Air. Henceforth, Fair Nymph, will I no more Be Sport for all the Skies; But Thy Superior Charms adore, And Venus, tho' Love's Queen, despise. APOLLO and DAPHNE: A Dialogue SONG. Apol. My Dearest Daphne, Charming Maid, Ah! Ease my Amorous Pain: Can'st thou the God of Day reject, And let Him sue in vain. Daph. I scorn Thee, tho' a GOD Thou art; Offensive is Thy Light: Perhaps, Thy Suit I might have heard, Had'st Thou been God of Night. On a Young Gentleman, and His Sister, who, by an Accident at Play, lost each of them an Eye. From AUSONIUS. Thyrsis, and CHLOE, on One Fatal Night Lost each an Eye: The Nymph her Left, the Swain his Right. In Forming Both Heav'n took Unusual Care, Both mov'd with an Inimitable Air; And Both, were like the GODS, Divinely Fair. THYRSIS, no more what CHLOE asks deny; But in Her Face transplant thy Lovely Eye. The Generous Action will the Nymph delight, And amply recompence thy Loss of Sight. Thou wilt, when Blind, a New Born Cupid prove, And She, with Two Such Eyes, the Queen of Love. A DIALOGUE between a Passenger, and a Turtle-Dove. From Mr. Pays. Passen. Why, Pretty Turtle, dost thou mourn Within this shady Grove? Dove. I've lost, alas! my Faithful Mate, The Partner of my Love. Passen. An't you afraid the Fowler's Hand Your Blood, like hers, should spill. Dove. Oh! no: For if he kills me not, Incessant Sorrow will. On Hearing AURELIA sing One Evening in the Park. I When Fair Aurelia tun'd her Voice, The List'ning Trees advanc'd, (As when of Old Amphion play'd) And in due Order danc'd. II The Feather'd Choir around her stood, Attentive to Her Song, And, as they catch'd Her Charming Notes, Would imitate 'em as they flew along. III Not the Soft Musick of The Nine, Or of th' Harmonious Spheres; Not the Soft Notes of Dying Swans Were Half so sweet as Hers. IV Sure 'twas Fair VENUS in Disguise, With Sweet APOLLO's Tongue: So much She like a Goddess lock'd, So like a GOD She sung. A SIMILE. From GUARINI. As the Fair, Tender, Budding ROSE, Which in some Curious Garden grows; Whilst Sable Night involves the Sky, Close in her Mother Stalk does lye: But when those Shades are drove away By the more Chearful Dawn of Day, She blows apace; Those Sweets reveals, From whence the Bee his Nectar steals. At last, when PhÅbus mounts the Skies, And views her with a Lover's Eyes, All her whole Bosom is o'respread With an Inimitable Red: But then, if on her Stalk She grows, 'Till the GOD half his Journey goes; Before his Race is fully run, Her Blushing Pride, and Glory's gone. A Pale, and Life-less Form She wears, And nothing like Herself appears. So a Young Virgin lives secure, Whilst in her Guardian Mother's Pow'r. No Danger of Delusion runs, Whilst She all Others Converse shuns: But if a Lover haply spies The Killing Lustre of her Eyes, And finds a Lucky Hour alone, To make his Ardent Passion known. Soon does Her Heart incline to prove The Joys of Hymeneal Love. But if thro' Modesty, or Fear, She durst not Her Chast Wish declare; Love's Scorching Fires within Her burn, And All Her Charms to Paleness turn. In Floods of Tears She wasts Her Eyes, A VIRGIN lives, a VIRGIN dies. The Bashful SHEPHERD: From GUARINI. I Why does my Timorous Soul start back, And meanly-fly away, Whene're I gaze on CELIA's Charms, Which far out-shine the Day? II Why does my Tongue its Motion lose, Which should my Pains reveal? Why, when so warm a Sun is near, Does my Heart's Blood congeal? III What is't such Terror can create, So much thy Soul surprize?â Has CELIA frown'd, and hast Thou felt The Lightning of Her Eyes? IV 'Tis soâBut Thou, my Coward Heart, Unjustly dost complain: For Such a Death should be esteem'd A Pleasure, not a Pain. To the Scornful CELIA. From TASSO. I See, CELIA, how the Lovely ROSE Buds with the Dawning Light! And, as the Day comes rowling on, Looks doubly Gay, and Bright! II But when the Night begins to spread Her Sable Horrors round; See, how She fades, and drooping lies All wither'd on the Ground! III No longer then with Killing Frowns Torment Your Faithful Swain; No more, like a Coy Vestal, fly, And wast Your Bloom in vain. IV Art Thou still Deaf?âStill with Disdain Dost Thou behold my Sorrow?â But know, tho' Thou art Fair to Day, Sickness may blast Thy Charms To Morrow. LOVE and DESPAIR: OR, The Disconsolate Shepherd. From Guarini's PASTOR FIDO. Enter Myrtillo and Ergasto. Myr Obdurate Maid! whose Comprehensive Name Amaryllis. Shews that the Sweets of Love are dash'd with Gall: More Beauteous art thou than the Blushing Rose, Fairer than Lillies, Gayer than the Morn; But deaf, alas! to All my Sighs and Tears; Deaf as the Winds, the Waters, or the Weather. Since then my Words have lost the Pow'r to please, Like Ravens Notes, sound harsh unto thine Ears, In solemn Silence I will dye before thee; Without a Groan will at thy Feet expire.â Yet All in vainâThere's not a Hill, or Vale, Or Murmuring Tree in Yonder Shady Grove (On which so often I have carv'd thy Name, To which I have so oft reveal'd my Passion) But will proclaim my Cruel Fate aloud. Each Rill shall shed a Sympathising Tear, Each Zephyr fills with Sighs the Ambient Air. Pity and Grief shall in my Eyes be read, And my Unhappy Cause by Turns shall plead. At last,â If All my Wrongs can no Compassion move My Death itself to all the World shall prove, I fell a Victim to the God of Love. Erga. Love is, my Friend, a Pain unspeakable; But to suppress it still augments my Pain. As the Hot Courser, when he feels the Curb, With double Speed scow'rs o're the Dusty Plain: So Love restrain'd, and in the Breast confin'd, With double Fury burns, and wrecks the Sense: In vain Thou striv'st to hide the Secret from me; For I have look'd into thy Artless Bosom, And view'd the Hurry which thy Soul is in. How often have I said Myrtillo loves, But will not tell the Object he adores! Myr. Nor would I now reveal my Luckless Passion, Did not Necessity extort it from me. What is my Happiness compar'd to her's? Rather I'd drag this Load of Life in Pain, Than in the least disturb my Fair One's Quiet. 'Tis whisper'd, my Ergasto, thro' our Plain, (And Oh! the News strikes thro' my trembling Heart) That Hymen will to Morrow join the Hands Of Amaryllis, and some Happy Swain; But who, as yet, my Friend, I cannot learn: Nor dare I ask, least I reveal my Flame, And find the Truth of what my Soul abhors. I know, alas! too well my Abject State, (For Love has not so far my Reason blinded) Ever to hope that Heav'n would bless my Arms With Such a Nymph, so exquisitely form'd, Adorn'd with every Grace, that Nature's Hand Could lavishly with all her Art bestow: Whose Mind is still superior to those Charms, And speaks its Essence to be All Divine. NoâSome ill Planet rul'd when I was born.â I'm doom'd to love, but never to enjoy. 'Tis Death, and Death alone can heal my Sorrows: And since my Fate's to be in Love with Death, With Utmost Pleasure I'd this Life forego; With Extacy expire, so that the Lovely Charmer Would bless me with her Eyes, and seal my Fate. I have but This, This Only Boon to ask, That She would hear her poor Myrtillo speak, Before She gives herself away for ever. Now Generous Youthâ If I am One in whom thy Soul takes Pleasure, Since Passion overbears me, plays the Tyrant, And hurries my Unstable, Flitting Soul To Madness and Despair;âPity my Sorrows, And lend me, if thou can'st, thy helping Hand. Erg. A small Request for a poor, dying Lover; Yet to accomplish what thy Soul desires, Is a hard Task, and of the Last Importance. Should the Fair Nymph's Stern Father chance to hear His Daughter listen'd to thy Love-sick Story, Or should the Fatal News once reach the Ears Of the High Priest Montano, (Silvio's Father) The Darling of thy Soul is lost for ever. For This, and This alone perhaps She flies thee: Her Frowns perhaps may prove but Artifice, And her Fond Heart may pity thee in Private: Women are more inclin'd to Love than Men; But with more Art conceal the Raging Pain. Grant this Suggestion trueâTell me, Myrtillo, Hasn't She Reason to deny thy Visit? In vain She listens to her Lover's Tale, Who wants the Power his wounded Soul to heal: Admits him to her Presence but in vain, When the soft Interview will but augment his Pain. And He, Myrtillo, doubtless is to blame, Who loves, despairs, and yet still fans the Flame. Myr. O! Could I once but entertain that Thought, My Anxious Pain would prove the Greatest Pleasure. But, my Dear Friend, (so may the Gods smile on thee) Do not conceal the Fatal Secret from me. Confirm my Fate, and boldly name the Swain, The Happy Swain, the Darling of the Stars. Erg. Dost thou not know the Rich, the Gallant Silvio, Montano's Only Son?â'Tis he. Myr. Thrice happy Swain! To have thy Stars dart down Their gentle Influence so early thee! Forgive me, if thou hear'st my tender Sighs; I envy not thy Fate, but mourn my own. Erg. Thou shouldstn't envy him, indeed, Myrtillo, He claims thy Pity rather. Myr. What! Pity, say'st thou. Erg. Yes, thy Pity; for he cannot love her. Myr. Is he a Man? and is his Heart untouch'd? Can he be blind to such a World of Charms? Or has her Eyes shot all their Fires at me, And left no Dart for any other Breast? But why must such a Glorious, Matchless Prize Be thrown into the Arms of One, who scorns, Or values not the Inestimable Blessing? Erg. Soon as their Nuptial Rites shall be perform'd, Indulgent Heav'n has promis'd to avert The direful Judgments that attend Arcadia. Hast thou not heard how our Offended Goddess Each Year demands a Spotless Virgin's Blood, (A Barbarous Tribute!) from our guilty Land. Myr. Never, Ergastoâ Nor blame, nor wonder at my Ignorance, Since tis but lately that I came amongst you; And since (so Love and Fate decreed) 'till now I've been The Constant Tenant of the Shady Groves. But sayâ What Heinous Crime has Arcadie committed, To draw such Vengeance on her guilty Head, And rouse such Fury in a Goddess' Breast? Erg. Since then Thou hast not heard the Fatal Story, I'll tell thee such a Mournful, Horrid Tale, Would rend ev'n Rocks, and soften knotted Oaks, Much more incline thy tender Soul to Pity.â Before the Sacred Priesthood was confin'd To One peculiar Age; A Gallant Youth, Diana's Favourite Priest (by Name Amyntas) Confess'd the Triumph of Lucrina's Eyes. The God of Love shot all his Fires from thence Into his Soul, and his whole Heart receiv'd them. The Nymph was made in Nature's purest Mould Without Alloy; her Form was all Divine. Heav'n, Heav'n itself was seated in her Eyes, But Hell, all Hell in her false treacherous Heart. For a long Time She crown'd Amynta's Pains With gentle Smiles, and seem'd at least to burn With mutual Flames; long fed his Hopes with Vows. Of Everlasting Truth, and Constant Love: And (while no Rival came t' oppose his Wishes) He reign'd sole Monarch of her Faithless Heart. But (Curse on the Jilt!) soon as Another Swain. Whisper'd his Love-sick Story in her Ears; The Treacherous Nymph transported at her Conquest, And raging with a Flood of New Desires, Forgot the Numerous Vows She made Amyntas, And seal'd his Ruin e're he knew the Cause; With utmost Detestation shun'd his Presence, And swore She'd see the Hated Youth no more. If now, Ingratitude so black as this, Should raise a Tempest in his troubl'd Soul, And drive him to Despair, thou best canst judge, Who knows a Lover's Pains by sad Experience. Myr. Oh! 'Tis beyond the Power of Words to pain: Distress like his. Erg. âAt last th' Unhappy Youth (Finding her deaf to all his Sighs and Tears, Deaf as the Winds, and as the Rocks unshaken) All prostrate at Diana's Sacred Altar, With trembling Accent thus bespoke his Goddess. If with an Upright Heart, and Guiltless Hand, I ever offer'd Sacrifice before Thee; If e're my Service has been grateful to Thee, Then from thy Awful Seat above look down, Assert my Cause, and plead It as thy Own. Pour down thy Vengeance on the Guilty Head Of that too Lovely Fair, but Cruel Maid, Who with her perjur'd Breath my honest Heart betray'd. With good Success the Youth preferr'd his Pray'rs. Cynthia look'd down, and heard his heavy Sighs, Saw all his Tears, and pity'd his Distress. Her Pity kindled in her Breast Revenge, And fann'd the Furious Flame; so strait She took Her Fatal Bow in her All-pow'rful Hand; Out of her Quiver drew her keenest Arrows, And shot them in the Bosom of Arcadia. Swift as the Forky Light'ning round they flew, Unerring, and Unseen; and Sure Destruction Attended every Dart. No Age, no Sex they spar'd, Relentless, did perform their dire Commission. In vain to Distant Rocks th' Arcadian flies, Within the Rocks the dire Contagion lies. Fruitless are Antidotes with Skill apply'd; The Artist falls by his weak Patient's Side. Man's utmost Efforts now prove ineffectual, And Heav'n alone can mitigate his Sorrows. So to the Nearest Oracle he flies, To know what Terms the Angry Gods propound; What Tribute they expect t' avert the Judgment. Soon from the Sacred Shrine this Answer came, This Shocking Answer, horrible to Nature. That Cynthia was provok'd, and to appease Her kindl'd Wrath, and seal Arcadia's Peace, Lucrina on her Altar must be laid, Or in Her Stead, some False, but Beauteous Maid, And by the Hands of Wrong'd Amyntas bleed. Fruitless are all her Sighs, and flowing Tears; In vain She flies to her New Lover's Arms, And with her Melting Eyes implores his Aid In vain, to save her from Approaching Ruin. The Beauteous Nymph, like a Gay Bride adorn'd, Was to Diana's Temple strait conducted, In all the Splendour, and the Solemn Pomp Religion could devise.âSoon as the Victim came, All-Pale, and Trembling to the Sacred Altar, (Her Lovely Eyes all-drown'd in Floods of Sorrow) Prostrate She fell before her Injur'd Lover, Expecting from his Hands the Stroak of Death. Boldly the Youth his Sacred Dagger drew; His Breast with Indignation seem'd to burn, His Brows to knit, his Angry Eyes to roll With Glowing Vengeance, Fury, and Despair. At last, with a Deep Sigh (Death's Harbinger) And Looks compos'd, he thus bespoke the Maid. O! Thou too Lovely, Faithless, Perjur'd Nymph, Judge of my Wrongs by this Tremendous Blow. This saidâHe plung'd the Fatal Weapon deep Into his Sacred Breast; and at Her trembling Feet The Victim, and the Priest fell down together. Like One that stands upon the Verge of Life, Confounded, and surpriz'd, Lucrina shiver'd, Doubtful as Yet, which had transfix'd her Heart, Excess of Sorrow, or the Dread of Death Soon as her scatter'd Senses were recall'd, And her lost Speech return'd; She, sighing, said. O, Generous Youth! I know thy wond'rous Worth, Thy Constancy, and Love, Alas! too late. The Sight of Thee thus dying by my Side, At Once revives; and wounds my Bleeding Heart. If I have sinn'd, (as doubtless I have sinn'd) In flying from the Embrace of One so Good; My Life shall make Attonement for th' Offence, And my Freed Soul shall dwell with thine for ever. With that She drew the Ponyard from his Breast, Warm with his Precious Blood, and plung'd it deep Into Her own.âTrembling, and Faint, She fell Into His dying Arms, who just had Life, Feebly to fold the Fair, and dye with Pleasure. Thus fell the too Indulgent, Constant Swain, Thus was the Nymph undone by Her Disdain. Myr. Unhappy Youth!âYet Happy in thy Love. What Opportunity more Great, more Glorious Could'st Thou have had, to shew th' Unshaken Faith? Who wouldn't dye to melt the Scornful Fair?â But what became of the distress'd Arcadians? Did the Contagion cease? Was Cynthia's Anger Perfectly appeas'd? Erg. The Storm, indeed, abated for a Time; But Oh! We never had a Perfect Calm. In the same Month of the Ensuing Year It rag'd with Greater Fury than before. With Speed again to Cynthia's Shrine we flew, But soon receiv'd an Answer more surprizing, More Horrible to Nature than the First. That Cynthia did expect to be obey'd; That then, and every Year, a Bride, or Maid, (Not Twenty) on Her Altar should be laid. This, when comply'd with, and the Victim slain, The Goddess would remove our Raging Pain. Nor was this All: The Goddess to torment Th' Unhappy Sex, prescrib'd this Cruel Law. A Law (which if we weigh their Natures well) We know they ne'r can keep; a Law that's wrote Without Remorse, in Characters of Blood. That every Bride, or Virgin, who should prove Inconstant to the Swain She Once did love, Should without Mercy in an Instant dye, Unless some Friend would the Nymph's Place supply. This National Calamity now Old Montano Hopes to remove by this Intended Match. For when again We to the Shrine apply'd, To know what Remedy the Heav'ns prescrib'd, To heal the Anxious Griefs Our Land groan'd under; After some Pause, This Answer was return'd. Cynthia will never smile, Nor hush the Raging Storm; 'Till Two of Race Divine Shall Hymen's Rites perform: 'Till some Fair, Generous Maid Shall bless her Faithful Swain; With Constancy Attonement make For the False Nymph's Disdain. Now, throughout All Arcadia, None are left Who claim a Title to Celestial Birth, But Silvio and Amaryllis: She The Daughter of the Mighty Pan, and He Alcides' Son. Nor has there met 'till now, (So much the harder our Unhappy Fate!) Two Branches of those Lines of Different Sex. Not without Grounds Montano therefore hopes (Tho' what the Sacred Oracle foretold Is not as Yet in every Point accomplish'd.) To find Our Remedy in This Alliance. This is the Fundamental Part; the Rest Lies hid at present in the Breast of Fate. Which, when the Nuptial Rites shall be perform'd, Will visibly appear. Myr. Never was Swain so wretched sure as I am! What Combination's here! What Pow'rs conspire To ruin One, half-dead with Grief already! Is't not enough the Pangs of Love to bear, That I must wage with Fate Unequal War? Erg. Cease thy Complainings, cease thy Flowing Tears; Tears will not cool, but fan Love's Raging Fires. Chear up, my Friend, and let's to Yonder Grove, Some Stratagem Ergasto will devise, (E're yet the Sun shall in the Ocean set) To introduce Thee to thy Charmer's Presence. With Sighs Thou striv'st to sooth thy Griefs in vain, Thy Sighs will prove but an Addition to thy Pain. So when a Fire a Field of Corn does seize, If the Wind's hush, it burns by Slow Degrees: But if a Furious Tempest chance to rise, At Once the Flame does the Whole Field surprize, And mounts with Fury to the Distant Skies.
