      <field name="fulltext">Written in a window at Greenhithe Ince Grice (now called Ingress) a place once belonging to the priory of Dartford, very agreeably situated near the Thames. It then belonged to Jonathan Smith, esq; who, with his brother Capt. Nathaniel Smith resided there, and made considerable improvements in the house and gardens. See “Harris's history of Kent,” p. 309. See also letter v of this collection, p. 20. It is now the seat of John Calcraft, esq; member of parliament for Rochester.. Great president of light and eye of day, As through this glass you cast your visual ray, And view with nuptial joys two brothers blest, And see us celebrate the genial feast, Confess, that, in your progress round the sphere, You've found the happiest youths and brightest beauties here. 1708. The TOASTERS. While circling healths inspire your sprightly wit, And on each glass some beauty's praise is writ, You ask, my friends, how can my silent muse To Montagu's Mary dutchess of Montagu, (born in 1689,) youngest daughter of John Duke of Marlborough, and mother to the present dutchess of Montagu. soft name a verse refuse? Bright though she be, of race victorious sprung, By wits ador'd, and by court-poets sung, Unmov'd I hear her person call'd divine, I see her features uninspiring shine; A softer fair my soul to transport warms, And, she once nam'd, no other nymph has charms. 1709. TOFTS Mrs. Tofts took her first grounds of music here in her own country, before the Italian taste had so highly prevailed.—Whatever defect the fashionably skilful might find in her manner, she had, in the general sense of her spectators, charms that few of the most learned singers ever arrive at. The beauty of her fine proportioned figure, and exquisitely sweet silver tone of her voice, with the peculiar rapid softness of her throat, were perfections not to be imitated by art or labour. “Cibber's apology, &amp;c. p. 319.” and MARGARITA Signora Margarita de L'Epine, afterwards married to Dr. Pepusch. She performed the part of Calypso in Mr. Hughes's “opera,” and in his “ode to the memory of the duke of Devonshire” Signora Margarita performed Britannia, and Mrs. Tofts Augusta. She also sung in several of his “cantatas” set by Dr. Pepusch.. Music has learn'd the discords of the state, And concerts jar with whig and tory hate. Here Somerset and Devonshire attend The British Tofts, and every note commend, To native merit just, and pleas'd to see We've Roman arts, from Roman bondage free. There fam'd L'Epine does equal skill employ, While list'ning peers crowd to th' ecstatic joy: Bedford, to hear her song, his dice forsakes, And Nottingham is raptur'd when she shakes: Lull'd statesmen melt away their drowsy cares Of England's safety in Italian airs. Who would not send each year blank passes o'er, Rather than keep such strangers from our shore? The WANDERING BEAUTY. 1 The graces and the wand'ring loves Are fled to distant plains, To chase the fawns, or in deep groves To wound admiring swains. With their bright mistress there they stray, Who turns her careless eyes From daily triumphs; yet, each day, Beholds new triumphs in her way And conquers while she flies. 2 But see! implor'd, by moving prayers, To change the lover's pain, Venus her harness'd doves prepares, And brings the fair again. Proud mortals, who this maid pursue, Think you, she'll e'er resign? Cease, fools, your wishes to renew, Till she grows flesh and blood like you, Or you, like her, divine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS In the year 1709, Mr. Hughes was concerned in a periodical work, entitled “The monthly amusement,” printed for Midwinter and Lintot. His translation of Moliere's “Misantrope” [see p. 44] was the second number, May 1709. “The fair-maid “of the inn” was translated by him, from Cervantes, for the same purpose, but not printed. These songs were inserted in it. They are “original,” but so artfully drawn up, as to give occasion for the same critical remarks that Cervantes makes on his “own” songs. Many years after, Mr. Jabez Hughes translated the same “novel,” probably without having seen or heard of his brother's translation. The songs are there closely traced from Cervantes, which was a work of some difficulty. It is inserted among “The select collection of novels and histories,” printed for Watts, 1729, vol. ii, p. 173.. I. Thy origin's divine, I see, Of mortal race thou can'st not be; Thy lip a ruby lustre shows; Thy purple cheek outshines the rose; And thy bright eye is brighter far Than any planet, any star. Thy sordid way of life despise, Above thy slavery, Sylvia, rise; Display thy beauteous form and mien. And grow a goddess, or a queen. II. 1 Constantia, see, thy faithful slave Dies of the wound thy beauty gave! Ah! gentle nymph, no longer try From fond pursuing love to fly. 2 Thy pity to my love impart, Pity my bleeding aching heart, Regard my sighs and flowing tears, And with a smile remove my fears. 3 A wedded wife if thou would'st be, By sacred Hymen join'd to me, Ere yet the western sun decline, My hand and heart shall both be thine. III. Thrice lov'd Constantia, heavenly fair, For thee a servant's form I wear; Though blest with wealth, and nobly born, For thee, both wealth and birth I scorn: Trust me, fair maid, my constant flame For ever will remain the same; My love, that ne'er will cease, my love Shall equal to thy beauty prove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Translated from PERSIAN VERSES, Alluding to the custom of women being buried with their husbands, and men with their wives. Eternal are the chains, which here The generous souls of lovers bind, When Hymen joins our hands, we swear To be for ever true and kind; And when, by death, the fair are snatch'd away, Lest we our solemn vows should break, In the same grave our living corps we lay, And willing the same fate partake. ANOTHER. My dearest spouse, that thou and I May shun the fear which first should die, Clasp'd in each others arms we'll live, Alike consum'd in love's soft fire, That neither may at last survive, But gently both at once expire. On ARQUEÄNASSA of COLOPHOS. From the Greek of Plato. Arqueänassa's charms inspire Within my breast a lover's fire; Age, its feeble spite displaying, Vainly wrinkles all her face, Cupids, in each wrinkle playing, Charm my eyes with lasting grace: But before old Time pursued her, Ere he sunk these little caves, How I pity those who view'd her, And in youth were made her slaves! On FULVIA, the wife of ANTONY. From the Latin of Augustus Cæsar. While from his consort false Antonius flies, And doats on Glaphyra's The poetical name for Citheris, an actress, of whom Antony was enamoured. Virgil consoles Gallus for her infidelity (in the xth eclogue) under the name of “Lycoris.” This epigram is preserved by Martial. far brighter eyes, Fulvia, provok'd, her female arts prepares, Reprisals seeks, and spreads for me her snares. “The husband's false”—But why must I endure This nauseous plague, and her revenge procure? What though she ask!—How happy were my doom, Should all the discontented wives of Rome Repair in crowds to me, when scorn'd at home! “'Tis war,” she says, “if I refuse her charms:” Let's think—She's ugly—Trumpets sound to arms! HUDIBRAS IMITATED. Written in the year 1710. O blessed time of reformation, That's now beginning through the nation! The Jacks bawl loud for church triumphant, And swear all whigs shall kiss the rump on't. See how they draw the beastly rabble With zeal and noises formidable, And make all cries about the town Join notes to roar fanatics down! As bigots give the sign about, They stretch their throats with hideous shout. Black tinkers bawl aloud “to settle “Church-privilege”—for “mending kettle.” Each sow-gelder, that blows his horn, Cries out “to have dissenters sworn.” The oyster-wenches lock their fish up, And cry, “No presbyterian bishop!” The mouse-trap men lay save-alls by, And 'gainst “low church men” loudly cry, A creature of amphibious nature, That trims betwixt the land and water, And leaves his mother in the lurch, To side with rebels 'gainst the church! Some cry for “penal laws,” instead Of “pudding-pies, and gingerbread:” And some, for “brooms, old boots, and shoes,” Roar out, “God! bless our commons house! Some bawl “the votes” about the town, And wish they'd “vote dissenters down.” Instead of “kitchen-stuff,” some cry, “Confound the late whig-ministry!” And some, for “any chairs to mend,” The commons late address commend. Some for “old gowns for china ware,” Exclaim against “extempore prayer:” And some, for “old suits, cloaks, or coats,” Cry, “D?n your preachers without notes!” He that cries “coney-skins, or onions.” Blames “toleration of opinions.” Blue-apron whores, that sit with furmety, Rail at “occasional conformity.” Instead of “cucumbers to pickle,” Some cry aloud, “No conventicle!” Masons, instead of “building houses,” To “build the church,” would starve their spouses, And gladly leave their trades, for storming The meeting-houses, or informing. Bawds, strumpets, and religion-haters, Pimps, pandars, atheists, fornicators, Rogues, that, like Falstaff, scarce know whether A church's inside's stone or leather, Yet join the parsons and the people To cry “the church,”—but mean “the steeple.” If, holy mother, such you'll own For your true sons, and such alone, Then heaven have mercy upon you, But the de'il take your beastly crew! The HUE and CRY. O yes!—Hear, all ye beaux and wits, Musicians, poets, 'squires, and cits, All, who in town or country dwell! Say, can you tale or tidings tell Of Tortorella's Mrs. Barbier, a celebrated actress and singer, who had then eloped from her father's house with a gallant. Mr. Hughes first recommended her to the notice of the public in the “Spectator,” vol. iii, numb. 231, for “her more than ordinary concern on her first appearance, in the opera of ‘Almahide,’ no less than her agreeable voice and just performance.” She performed the part of Telemachus in Mr. Hughes's opera of “Calypso,” and Daphne in his masque of “Apollo and Daphne.” A late noble lord, who knew her well, expressed his opinion of her as follows: “She never could rest long in a place; her affectations increased with her years. I remember her in the parts of Turnus and Orontes, when the operas of Camilla and Thomyris were represented at Lincoln's-inn-fields. She loved change so well, that she liked to change her sex.” hasty flight? Why in new groves she takes delight, And if in concert, or alone, The cooing murmurer makes her moan? Now learn the marks, by which you may Trace out and stop the lovely stray! Some wit, more folly, and no care, Thoughtless her conduct, free her air; Gay, scornful, sober, indiscreet, In whom all contradictions meet; Civil, affronting, peevish, easy, Form'd both to charm you and displease you; Much want of judgment, none of pride, Modish her dress, her hoop full wide; Brown skin, her eyes of sable hue, Angel, when pleas'd, when vex'd, a shrew. Genteel her motion, when she walks, Sweetly she sings, and loudly talks; Knows all the world, and its affairs, Who goes to court, to plays, to prayers, Who keeps, who marries, fails, or thrives, Leads honest, or dishonest, lives; What money match'd each youth or maid, And who was at each masquerade; Of all fine things in this fine town, She's only to herself unknown. By this description, if you meet her, With lowly bows, and homage greet her; And if you bring the vagrant beauty Back to her mother and her duty, Ask for reward a lover's bliss, And (if she'll let you) take a kiss; Or more, if more you wish and may, Try if at church the words she'll say, Then make her, if you can—“obey.” 1717. The MORNING APPARITION. Written at Wallington-house The seat of Mr. Bridges. in Surry. All things were hush'd, as noise itself were dead; No midnight mice stirr'd round my silent bed; Not ev'n a gnat disturb'd the peace profound; Dumb o'er my pillow hung my watch unwound; No ticking death-worm told a fancy'd doom, Nor hidden cricket chirrup'd in the room; No breeze the casement shook, or fann'd the leaves, Nor drops of rain fell soft from off the eaves; Nor noisy splinter made the candle weep, But the dim watch-light seem'd itself asleep, When tir'd I clos'd my eyes—How long I lay In slumber wrapp'd, I list not now to say: When hark! a sudden noise—See! open flies The yielding door—I, starting, rubb'd my eyes, Fast clos'd awhile; and as their lids I rear'd, Full at my feet a tall thin form appear'd, While through my parted curtains rushing broke A light like day, ere yet the figure spoke. Cold sweat bedew'd my limbs—nor did I dream; Hear, mortals, hear! for real truth's my theme. And now, more bold, I rais'd my trembling bones To look—when lo! 'twas honest master Jones The butler.; Who wav'd his hand, to banish fears and sorrow, Well charg'd with toast and sack, and cry'd “Good morrow!” 1719.</field>
