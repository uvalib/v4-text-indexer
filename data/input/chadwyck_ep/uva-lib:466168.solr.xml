      <field name="fulltext">“The story Truth now brings to light Has long, too long, lain hid in night, But she, bright goddess, shall reveal it; And though My Lord his head may shake, By Jupiter! I would not take Five hundred guineas to conceal it.” A POEM, &amp;c. I. Angels, and ministers of grace, defend us From ex-officio writs tremendous! From Garrow, Plomer, and Judge Gibbs. I've got a tale, whose lightest part Will freeze thy blood, distract thy heart, And make it knock against thy ribs! II. Attend unto it's secret birth, Ye Kings, and Princes of the earth! Ye mortals both above, and under us; No tale of demons, ghosts, and caverns, Or bloods in scuffles kill'd at taverns, Is half so dreadful, dark, and wond'rous! III. The story, Truth now brings to light, Has long, too long, lain hid in night, But she, bright goddess, shall reveal it; And tho' my Lord his head may shake, By Jupiter, I would not take Five hundred guineas to conceal it! IV. In ancient times, when freedom smil'd On Gotham's favor'd prosp'rous land, When cheerfully the ploughman toil'd, And plenty blest his lab'ring hand, V. There reign'd a Prince, a noble youth, Whose praises oft' were loudly caroll'd, Pattern of constancy and truth, Not like that idle rogue, “Childe Harold,” Who to reform would ne'er begin, 'Till it grew troublesome to sin. VI. His court was fill'd with beauteous dames, Who burn'd with Cupid's fiercest flames, I wish I could disclose their names, Tho' that perhaps might breed some tattle: Suffice it, that the nymphs who burn'd, Had all their passions well return'd, By chiefs who much applause had earn'd, In various bloody fields of battle. VII. No harricot, or French ragout, No dainty hash, delicious stew, No fish that swam, no bird that flew, But grac'd his free and plenteous table; Good fellowship and glorious cheer, In Gotham reign'd throughout the year, And guests were all invited here, To cram as long as they were able. VIII. Bright sparkling draughts of gen'rous wine, That fill the soul with thoughts divine, And manly hearts to love incline, Inspir'd the chiefs with deeds of arms; While many a toast would conquer those Who ne'er were conquer'd by their foes, Undaunted men! who live on blows, And thrive the best 'midst war's alarms. IX. Nor did sweet music's softer power Refuse to crown the festive hour, Apollo left his sacred bower, To fill with harmony the scene: Some tender soft and plaintive air, Which spoke the lover's anxious care, Alternate hope, and deep despair, With dying symphonies between. X. The airy dance and jovial song, By turns solac'd the courtly throng, And merrily they tripp'd along To hautboy dulcimer and fiddle; While some to give their wit a handle, Sat down to chocolate and scandal, Conundrum, forfeit, jest, and riddle. XI. And I might tell, as bards have done— Of those that lost, and those that won, How many curs'd the morning sun, (Such curses heav'n ne'er bring upon us!) How fair ones took their partners in, (A common case with those who win,) And lady Roundabout M'Flinn Was six by cards, and four by honors. XII. It was propos'd at council board, By many a sage, and many a lord, Who Gotham, and it's Prince ador'd, That some fair nymph of honor peerless Should glad their monarch's royal arms, And fill his breast with fond alarms, As life unbless'd with beauty's charms, Is dreary, barren, cold, and cheerless. XIII. Twelve noble peers in robes of state, Exulting sought the palace gate, Big with the kingdom's future fate, (For which, good souls! they were assembled:) In solemn pace they march'd along, With wigs magnificently long, Amazement seiz'd the vulgar throng, They gaz'd with awe, with fear they trembled. XIV. Thrice did these loyal men of wonder Assail the gate, with knocks like thunder, Which at their bidding flew asunder: And now the palace yard they enter; In time they reach the council hall, Where fifty yeoman stout and tall, Stood ready, at their prince's call, Whose throne imperial grac'd the centre. XV. So low they kneel'd with awe profound, Their huge full-bottoms swept the ground, With duty, rev'rence, and submission; But soon encourag'd by His Highness, They with true magisterial dryness Disclos'd the object of their mission. XVI. The Prince he started, gap'd, look'd weazen, The nobles with sufficient reason, Were fearful they had utter'd treason, And whispering “Sure the Prince will scold us!” Besought in supplicating strain, Their heads might not be cut in twain, But be permitted to remain Just where they stood—upon their shoulders. XVII. Loud laugh'd the Prince to hear them croak, His Highness much enjoy'd the joke, And thus in gentle accents spoke, “Good gentlemen! may I be pounded In some apothecary's mortar, Or stand up, by the head the shorter, Be kill'd by land, or drown'd by water, But that your fears are idly grounded. XVIII. 'Tis true, I started and was dumb, To see your rev'rend worships come Upon an embassy so rum, With long bag-wigs, and robes of ermine; And, (to add comfort to my life) Beseech me thus to take a wife, (Heav'n guard me from the nuptial strife!) A thing I ne'er could yet determine. XIX. “For women are such noisy cattle, Their pretty tongues go tittle tattle, Just like a fine three-farthing rattle, Which we may buy at fair of Bart'lemy; And then the thought is most appalling, Of wives hallooing, children squalling, Such matrimonial caterwauling I think is quite enough to startle me. XX. “And then you'll own (for nought more sure is,) That ladies tho' in beauty houries, In temper may be downright furies, And make their husbands in the room sticks; And in the sight of ev'ry neighbour, Their backs indignantly belabor, And make them dance without a tabor, To little instruments call'd broomsticks. XXI. “And tell me, nobles, would it pleasure ye To see me rob the royal treasury, To furnish this expensive goddess? For she must have her caps, and veils, Her furbelows, and farthingales, Her golden stomacher, and bodice. XXII. “And she must have her box of paint, Or else her ladyship would faint, Swear you were stingy, I were cruel; And then (good people, have compassion!) In some accursed whim of fashion, She'd sell my kingdom for a jewel. XXIII. “And she must have quite snug and handy, A private thimble-full of brandy, To cure the mulligrubs, so stitching; And, though a nymph of peerless honor, The habit p'r'aps may steal upon her, For liquor's mightily bewitching. XXIV. “And sure 'twould shock my tender feeling To see her Majesty a-reeling, Drunk as the sow of good King David; And if (an accident not rare,) My royal wife should curse and swear, Lord, how the multitude would stare, To see their Queen so ill-behaved! XXV. “And she must have to wait upon her, Grooms, pages, aye, and maids of honor, A mob impertinent and lazy; And then a coxcomb hot from France To teach her gracefully to dance, Or curl and dress her auburn jazey. XXVI. “And she must have her balls and plays, And chambermaids to lace her stays, And birth-day suits for gala days, Hoop-petticoats, and silks and flounces; And then to make her sweet and fair, Three pound of powder in her hair, Pomatum, Russia oil, so rare, And huile antique, full twenty ounces. XXVII. “Besides some pompous poor relation To steal my cash, and starve my nation, Who'd of my subjects match the tallest; While some huge whisker'd German chief Will swallow me six pounds of beef, And prove his stomach not the smallest. XXVIII. “And sure such vile infernal cramming In Gotham's land would breed a famine, Or else I'm grievously mistaken; And 'twould much discontent produce To give five shillings for a goose, Or six-pence for a pound of bacon. XXIX. “And if ('tis no impossibility,) This lovely pattern of gentility, To prove herself of true nobility, When in the marriage noose we're buckled, (It is an ill which most I fear, As women's taste is sometimes queer,) Should fancy some tall grenadier, And make your faithful Prince a cuckold. XXX. “Lord, how the boys would hoot, and hollo, The fishwomen my footsteps follow, E'en the blind children of Apollo Would pester me with filthy ditties; While some with bowels of compassion, As horns are now so much the fashion, Perhaps would moderate their passion, And cry, “Oh! 'tis a thousand pities.” XXXI. “Now though with love the sex may tickle us, I think it mightily ridiculous That men of sense should thus be duped; And tho' I'm gallant to the marrow, I ne'er was wounded by the arrow Of that sly vagabond, young Cupid. XXXII. “Such ills must surely have great weight To warn me from the marriage state, For they in time might prove my own; And you perhaps would rue the hour A faithless woman shar'd the power Of Gotham's Prince, and Gotham's throne. XXXIII. “But still, if I could chance to meet A nymph with every grace replete, In mind and body, quite complete, I promise—by the foot of Pharaoh, That, vanquish'd by her matchless charms, Dispelling all these dread alarms, And rushing to her virgin arms I'd wed her—and be proud to wear her.” XXXIV. Thus spake the Prince—as I have sung— The hall with acclamation rung, His praises dwelt on ev'ry tongue, His eloquence was past resistance; “Heaven bless his Highness!” was the call, From young, and old—from great and small, The words re-echoed through the hall, And folks could hear at ten miles distance. XXXV. When lo! a voice was heard to say “Great Monarch, whom we all obey, Thrice blessed be the happy day That thus confirms our humble claim!— A peerless damsel we have found For all these virtues much renown'd, She dwells far hence on foreign ground, And Carolina is her name. XXXVI. “No princess can with her compare, Her mind is as her body fair, For ev'ry charm is center'd there, That man can love, and heart desire; Her beauteous form and winning grace, On Gotham's throne deserve a place, And truly noble is her race, A dauntless monarch is her sire. XXXVII. “For her our ships shall cross the seas, And boldly face the northern breeze, To fetch the nymph whom all adore; May gentle winds, and prosperous gales Impel the waves, and fill the sails, And waft her safe to Gotham's shore.” XXXVIII. One tedious moon in silence pass'd, The happy day arriv'd at last, That all their anxious wishes crown'd; The Prince beheld the lovely dame, Her beauty soon his heart o'ercame, And feeling both a mutual flame, In Hymen's silken chains were bound. XXXIX. And now descend, ye tuneful Choir, The poet's towering verse inspire, And O! impart your sacred fire And make him equal to the theme: Let gay description's lively hand The hymeneal scene expand, Sublime, magnificent, and grand, More beauteous than a fairy dream. XL. The morn was bright—the radiant sun In joy his daily course begun, And smil'd upon the royal pair; The warbling birds on every spray With music usher'd in the day, And sweetest flowers perfum'd the air. XLI. The merry bells rang loud and strong, And hail'd them as they pass'd along, Nor were the drums and trumpets mute; Twelve virgins in apparel neat, Strew'd pinks and roses 'neath their feet, And minstrels touch'd the harp and lute. XLII. Two hundred horsemen rode in sight, On milk-white steeds, in armour bright, With lances ready for the fight, Which mock'd the sun's meridian rays: Fair Gotham's nobles grac'd the scene, And ladies all superbly sheen, In honor to their king and queen, Appear'd in grandeur's brightest blaze. XLIII. The Prince in costly robes was drest, A diamond glitter'd on his breast, The crown his royal temples prest, Th'imperial crown of Gotham's land; The sword of state a herald bore, Who rode triumphantly before, But that of peace the monarch wore, The princely sceptre grac'd his hand. XLIV. And next him sat his youthful Bride, A blooming nymph, in beauty's pride, To truth and modesty allied, The star that most adorn'd his throne: Her rich attire, majestic mien, And graceful air, bespoke the queen, Gems, rubies, on her dress were seen, And India's brightest diamonds shone. XLV. And now the trumpet's brazen throat, Pours forth a loud and warlike note, And minstrels sweep the tuneful string; A thousand voices rend the air, They loudly bless the royal pair, And thus their hymeneals sing. Hymeneal. XLVI. Hail to the Bride with her golden lac'd stomacher, Breathing delightful Arabia's perfume! And hail to the Prince who'll triumphantly rummage her, Grac'd with his gorget, and high-waving plume. Matchless is he, for good sense and politeness, Her sparkling eyes are unrivall'd for brightness, And fam'd in the dance is her foot for it's lightness, Long may they reign in health, beauty, and bloom! XLVII. Strike up the tabors! and let us have noise enough, Bless their dear faces! how sweetly they smile; Tight little Hymen will soon bring 'em boys enough, The glory, the boast, and the pride of our isle! Skip it, and trip it, in merry cotillion O! A day like the present, is sure worth a million O! See how they gallop, for Cupid's postillion O! Wriggling, and giggling and blushing the while! LXVIII. Ten thousand men with streamers gay Loud cheering, clos'd the long array, And hail'd with joy th'auspicious day That rose so full of cheering beams: Nor did sweet mirth resign his power In homely cot, or lordly tower, 'Till sleep stole on the festive hour, Which soon return'd in pleasing dreams. LXIX. A year roll'd on—and scarcely more— The Queen a smiling Cherub bore, (And now the Muse would fain be dumb:) Ah! little thought she 'twas her last, That grief would soon her life o'ercast, Her hours of happiness were past, Her days of sorrow all to come. L. In Gotham's court there liv'd a Dame, Who (void of grace remorse, and shame,) Burn'd with a foul, unhallow'd flame, And one, whom scandal oft' would peck at: The Furies saw her youthful mind To lust, and infamy inclin'd, They form'd her well to plague mankind, And call'd the bellweather—Fitzhecat. LI. Her face, which marks of beauty bore, Was now with wrinkles furrow'd o'er, And on her breast a cross she wore. Tho' stain'd with guilt, and foul within: Her locks were grey—her eyes were dim— Palsy had seiz'd each tottering limb, Eye scarce beheld a form so grim, Sad monument of death and sin. LII. Her artful leer, and wanton air, (Tho' time had silver'd ev'ry hair,) Bespoke the harlot still was there, The verriest hag of Cyprian shade; And while her num'rous beads she told, Her blinking eyes lascivious roll'd, For she was amorous, tho' old, And thought of coxcombs while she pray'd. LIII. Each rising morn, the courtly beaux, With flaxen wig—and birth-day cloaths, And borrow'd teeth in ivory rows, She strove to charm—what pious knavery! Her eye-brows artfully were plac'd, Her wither'd cheeks bedaub'd with taste, Her wrinkles well fill'd up with paste, And scents she us'd for smells unsavory. LIV. She cast her eye on Gotham's Pride, And envied much his lovely Bride, And Satan's blackest arts she tried To win him from her constant arms; And many a pow'rful magic spell The belldam knew, and practis'd well, And Gotham's Prince untimely fell A victim to her fiendlike charms. LV. His court a scene of vice became, And crimes too horrible to name In Gotham's land were held no shame, In male or female, prince or peer; The grey Seducer, curst of God, Receiv'd the Prince's smile and nod, He held a white official rod, And poison'd oft' the monarch's ear. LVI. Husbands would prostitute their wives, To live like courtiers all their lives, (When folly rules, injustice thrives, For one's base interest is the other's:) Fitzhecat reign'd with one accord O'er mistress, people, prince, and lord, Supreme procuress, queen, and bawd, And sons were found to sell their mothers. LVII. The laws, which Gotham's bulwark stood, For which she'd shed her bravest blood, Attorneys vile betray'd in court; Her judges, truth and wisdom lack'd, Her juries all were basely pack'd, And oaths, and verdicts held in sport. LVIII. Poor scribbling rogues (there hangs a tale) Were banish'd to some distant jail, Because they told plain truths, call'd libels! And plund'rers, of no small dimensions Were granted sinecures and pensions, And plays were more in vogue than bibles. LIX. Yet not Fitzhecat's charms alone Detach'd the Monarch from his throne, For him no virgin loos'd her zone, But view'd the profligate with heavings; And Gotham's Prince in life's last stage, To satisfy his amorous rage, Took up with ugliness and age His servants' worn out loathsome leavings. LX. There was a portly nymph of sin, Whose stomach almost reach'd her chin, Call'd Lady Roundabout M'Flinn, Of figure, face, and bulk, uncommon: A graceless harlot run to seed, Whom ev'ry one that saw, agreed, Was surely of the monster breed, More a hermaphrodite, than woman. LXI. The Prince her husband's brows t'adorn, Had planted there a golden horn, And plac'd his lordship in the palace; Where well-bred cuckolds, pimps, and peers, And letchers, old in sin, and years, Kept sinking Gotham in arrears, Defying all the shafts of malice. LXII. Her credit sunk, her taxes rose, She saw her sons borne down with woes, Herself encompass'd by her foes, Who brav'd her threats, her strength defied; And Gotham, who triumphant bore Her arms to ev'ry distant shore, No longer heard her cannons roar, Or saw her ships the ocean ride. LXIII. Her armies, fam'd for valor's meed, She saw a weak commander lead, Who ne'er achiev'd one warlike deed, Or gave his country's foes a trimming; A swaggering, proud, unwieldy lubber, Well known for cowardice, and blubber, And only fit to play a rubber With simp'ring chiefs, or bilk the women. LXIV. Thus have I told in faithful rhymes, (A warning to the present times) How Gotham was debas'd by crimes Of men, who held the highest stations; And let no future bard proclaim The direful story of her shame, But may her lost, degraded name Be blotted from the list of nations. LXV. Thrice happy Britain! favor'd isle, Where justice, peace, and plenty smile, Thy praise demands my votive song; Art thou, like Gotham, fall'n, accurst, Plagu'd by a monarch deem'd the worst?— Ah no! thy Prince by virtue nurs'd, Abhors the me an, and vicious throng. LXVI. Thy court, for merit passing rare, No gamesters, cuckolds, pimps, are there, But gentle lords, and ladies fair, Sipping their coffee, wine, and sherbet; There's Y?m?th's lord, who from his birth Has prov'd a miracle of worth, And H?t?d, fairest nymph on earth, Except that matchless star, Fitzherbert. LXVII. There's Headfort, Nature's choice production, An enemy to base seduction, The pink of dukes, of knights, and peers; No wretch is he of pimping fame, No hoary letcher, lost to shame, Whose passions age can never tame, But one whose virtues grace his years. LXVIII. And let me sing without rebuke, The praises of each royal duke, (Not like unhappy Gotham's gabies;) But Princes who can write and read, And emulous of glory's meed, Of ev'ry vile dishonest deed As innocent, as new-born babies. LXIX. And let me sing in nice rotation, The num'rous worthies of the nation, Whose fame smells sweetly, like geranium; But hold—good folks—for so much sense I can't afford for eighteen-pence, You'd fancy I hold cheap, from thence, The labors of my pericraneum. LXX. But yet again, in merry strain, I'll prove Britannia's loyal herald; Ye Muses fire me—ye Gods inspire me. With stanzas worthy of Fitzgerald! LXXI. Heav'n bless the Regent and his Mother, Each sister, minister, and brother, His daughter more than any other; And grant her beauty, health, prosperity; And thou my country! land divine Oh! ne'er may Gotham's fate be thine, Long may thy Prince in virtue shine And truly great, be proud to merit thee.
