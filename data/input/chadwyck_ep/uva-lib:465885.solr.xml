      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I [THE SEASONS.] TO MR. THOMSON, DOUBTFUL TO WHAT PATRON HE SHOULD ADDRESS HIS POEM CALLED WINTER. Some peers, perhaps, have skill to judge, 'tis true; Yet no mean prospect bounds the Muse's view. Firm in your native strength, thus nobly shown, Slight such delusive props, and stand alone; Fruitless dependance oft has found too late That greatness rarely dwells among the great. Patrons are Nature's nobles, not the state's, And wit's a title no broad seal creates: E'en kings, from whose high source all honours flow, Are poor in power when they would souls bestow. Heedless of fortune then look down on state, Balanced within by reason's conscious weight: Divinely proud of independent will, Prince of your passions, live their sovereign still. He who stoops safe beneath a patron's shade Shines, like the moon, but by another's aid; Free truth should open and unbias'd steer, Strong as heaven's heat, and as its brightness clear. O, swell not then the bosoms of the vain With false conceit that you protection gain; Poets, like you, their own protectors stand, Placed above aid from pride's inferior hand. Time, that devours the lord's unlasting name, Shall lend her soundless depth to float your fame. On verse like yours no smiles from power expect, Born with a worth that doom'd you to neglect; Yet, would your wit be noised, reflect no more, Let the smooth veil of flattery silk you o'er; Aptly attach'd, the court's soft climate try, Learn your pen's duty from your patron's eye. Ductile of soul, each pliant purpose wind, And, tracing interest close, leave doubt behind: Then shall your name strike loud the public ear; For through good fortune virtue's self shines clear. But, in defiance of our taste, to charm! And fancy's force with judgment's caution arm! Disturb, with busy thought, so lull'd an age! And plant strong meanings o'er the peaceful page! Impregnate sound with sense! teach nature art! And warm e'en Winter till it thaws the heart! How could you thus your country's rules transgress, Yet think of patrons, and presume success? A. Hill. TO MR. THOMSON, ON HIS BLOOMING WINTER. Oh gaudy summer, veil thy blushing head, Dull is thy sun, and all thy beauties dead: From thy short nights, and noisy mirthful day, My kindling thoughts, disdainful, turn away. Majestic Winter with his floods appears, And o'er the world his awful terrors rears: From north to south his train dispreading slow, Blue frost, bleak rain, and fleecy-footed snow. In thee, sad Winter, I a kindred find, Far more related to poor human kind; To thee my gently drooping head I bend, Thy sigh my sister, and thy tear my friend; On thee I muse, and in thy hastening sun, See life expiring e'er 'tis well begun. Thy sickening ray and venerable gloom Show life's last scene, the solitary tomb; But thou art safe, so shaded by the bays, Immortal in the noblest poet's praise; From time and death he will thy beauties save; Oh may such numbers weep o'er Mira's grave! Secure and glorious would her ashes lie, Till Nature fadeâand all the Seasons die. Mira. TO MR. THOMSON, ON HIS PUBLISHING THE SECOND EDITION OF HIS POEM, CALLED WINTER. Charm'd and instructed by thy powerful song, I have, unjust, withheld my thanks too long; This debt of gratitude at length receive, Warmly sincere, 'tis all thy friend can give. Thy worth new lights the poet's darken'd name, And shows it, blazing, in the brightest fame. Through all thy various Winter full are found, Magnificence of thought and pomp of sound, Clear depth of sense, expression's heightening grace, And goodness, eminent in power and place! For this, the wise, the knowing few commend With zealous joyâfor thou art virtue's friend: Even age and truth severe, in reading thee, That Heaven inspires the muse, convinced agree. Thus I dare sing of merit faintly known, Friendlessâsupported by itself alone: For those whose aided will could lift thee high In fortune, see not with discernment's eye. Nor place nor power bestows the sight refined, And wealth enlarges not the narrow mind. How couldst thou think of such and write so well? Or hope reward by daring to excel! Unskilful of the age! untaught to gain Those favours which the fawning base obtain! A thousand shameful arts to thee unknown, Falsehood and flattery must be first thy own. If thy loved country lingers in thy breast, Thou must drive out the unprofitable guest; Extinguish each bright aim that kindles there, And centre in thyself thy every care. But hence that vilenessâpleased to charm mankind, Cast each low thought of interest far behind: Neglected into noble scornâaway From that worn path where vulgar poets stray; Inglorious herd! profuse of venal lays! And by the pride despised they stoop to praise! Thou, careless of the statesman's smile or frown, Tread that straight way that leads to fair renown. By virtue guided, and by glory fired, And by reluctant envy slow admired, Dare to do well, and in thy boundless mind Embrace the general welfare of thy kind; Enrich them with the treasures of thy thought, What Heaven approves and what the Muse has taught Where thy power fails, unable to go on, Ambitious, greatly will the good undone. So shall thy name, through ages, brightening shine, And distant praise from worth unborn be thine. So shalt thou, happy! merit Heaven's regard, And find a glorious, though a late reward. D. Malloch SPRING. Et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos, Nunc frondent silvÃ¦, nunc formosissimus annus. VIRG.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF HERTFORD. ARGUMENT. The subject proposed. Inscribed to the Countess of Hertford. The Season is described as it affects the various parts of Nature, ascending from the lower to the higher; with digressions arising from the subject. Its influence on inanimate Matter, on Vegetables, on brute Animals, and last on Man; concluding with a dissuasive from the wild and irregular passion of Love, opposed to that of a pure and happy kind. Come, gentle Spring! ethereal Mildness! come, And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud, While music wakes around, veil'd in a shower Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend. O Hertford, fitted or to shine in courts With unaffected grace, or walk the plain With innocence and meditation join'd In soft assemblage, listen to my song, Which thy own Season paints; when Nature all Is blooming and benevolent, like thee. And see where surly Winter passes off, Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts: His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill, The shatter'd forest, and the ravaged vale; While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch, Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost, The mountains lift their green heads to the sky. As yet the trembling year is unconfirm'd, And Winter oft at eve resumes the breeze, Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets Deform the day delightless: so that scarce The bittern knows his time, with bill ingulf'd, To shake the sounding marsh; or from the shore The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath, And sing their wild notes to the listening waste At last from Aries rolls the bounteous sun, And the bright Bull receives him. Then no more The expansive atmosphere is cramp'd with cold But, full of life and vivifying soul, Lifts the light clouds sublime, and spreads then thin, Fleecy, and white, o'er all-surrounding heaven. Forth fly the tepid airs: and unconfined, Unbinding earth, the moving softness strays. Joyous, the impatient husbandman perceives Relenting Nature, and his lusty steers Drives from their stalls, to where the well used plough Lies in the furrow, loosen'd from the frost. There, unrefusing, to the harness'd yoke They lend their shoulder, and begin their toil, Cheer'd by the simple song and soaring lark. Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining share The master leans, removes the obstructing clay, Winds the whole work, and sidelong lays the glebe While through the neighbouring fields the sowe stalks, With measured step, and liberal throws the grain Into the faithful bosom of the ground; The harrow follows harsh, and shuts the scene. Be gracious, Heaven! for now laborious Man Has done his part. Ye fostering breezes, blow! Ye softening dews, ye tender showers, descend! And temper all, thou world-reviving sun, Into the perfect year! Nor ye who live In luxury and ease, in pomp and pride, Think these lost themes unworthy of your ear: Such themes as these the rural Maro sung To wide-imperial Rome, in the full height Of elegance and taste, by Greece refined. In ancient times the sacred plough employ'd The kings and awful fathers of mankind: And some, with whom compared your insect-tribes Are but the beings of a summer's day, Have held the scale of empire, ruled the storm Of mighty war; then, with unwearied hand, Disdaining little delicacies, seized The plough, and greatly independent lived. Ye generous Britons, venerate the plough! And o'er your hills, and long withdrawing vales, Let Autumn spread his treasures to the sun, Luxuriant and unbounded: as the sea, Far through his azure turbulent domain, Your empire owns, and from a thousand shores Wafts all the pomp of life into your ports; So with superior boon may your rich soil, Exuberant, Nature's better blessings pour O'er every land, the naked nations clothe, And be the exhaustless granary of a world! Nor only through the lenient air this change, Delicious, breathes; the penetrative sun, His force deep-darting to the dark retreat Of vegetation, sets the steaming Power At large, to wander o'er the verdant earth, In various hues; but chiefly thee, gay green! Thou smiling Nature's universal robe! United light and shade! where the sight dwells With growing strength, and ever-new delight. From the moist meadow to the wither'd hill, Led by the breeze, the vivid verdure runs, And swells, and deepens, to the cherish'd eye. The hawthorn whitens; and the juicy groves Put forth their buds, unfolding by degrees, Till the whole leafy forest stands display'd, In full luxuriance to the sighing gales; Where the deer rustle through the twining brake, And the birds sing conceal'd. At once array'd In all the colours of the flushing year, By Nature's swift and secret working hand, The garden glows, and fills the liberal air With lavish fragrance; while the promised fruit Lies yet a little embryo, unperceived, Within its crimson folds. Now from the town Buried in smoke, and sleep, and noisome damps, Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields, Where freshness breathes, and dash the trembling drops From the bent bush, as through the verdant maze Of sweetbriar hedges I pursue my walk; Or taste the smell of dairy; or ascend Some eminence, Augusta, in thy plains, And see the country, far diffused around, One boundless blush, one white-empurpled shower Of mingled blossoms; where the raptured eye Hurries from joy to joy, and, hid beneath The fair profusion, yellow Autumn spies. If, brush'd from Russian wilds, a cutting gale Rise not, and scatter from his humid wings The clammy mildew; or, dry-blowing, breathe Untimely frost; before whose baleful blast The full-blown Spring through all her foliage shrinks, Joyless and dead, a wide-dejected waste. For oft, engender'd by the hazy north, Myriads on myriads, insect armies warp Keen in the poison'd breeze; and wasteful eat, Through buds and bark, into the blacken'd core, Their eager way. A feeble race! yet oft The sacred sons of vengeance; on whose course Corrosive Famine waits, and kills the year. To check this plague, the skilful farmer chaff And blazing straw before his orchard burns; Till, all involved in smoke, the latent foe From every cranny suffocated falls: Or scatters o'er the blooms the pungent dust Of pepper, fatal to the frosty tribe: Or, when the envenom'd leaf begins to curl, With sprinkled water drowns them in their nest; Nor, while they pick them up with busy bill, The little trooping birds unwisely scares. Be patient, swains; these cruel seeming winds Blow not in vain. Far hence they keep repress'd Those deepening clouds on clouds, surcharged with rain, That o'er the vast Atlantic hither borne, In endless train, would quench the summer-blaze, And, cheerless, drown the crude unripen'd year. The north-east spends his rage; he now shut up Within his iron cave, the effusive south Warms the wide air, and o'er the void of Heaven Breathes the big clouds with vernal showers distent. At first a dusky wreath they seem to rise, Scarce staining ether; but by swift degrees, In heaps on heaps, the doubling vapour sails Along the loaded sky, and mingling deep Sits on the horizon round a settled gloom: Not such as wintry-storms on mortals shed, Oppressing life; but lovely, gentle, kind, And full of every hope and every joy, The wish of Nature. Gradual sinks the breeze Into a perfect calm; that not a breath Is heard to quiver through the closing woods, Or rustling turn the many-twinkling leaves Of aspin tall. The' uncurling floods, diffused In glassy breadth, seem through delusive lapse Forgetful of their course. 'Tis silence all And pleasing expectation. Herds and flocks Drop the dry sprig, and mute-imploring eye The falling verdure. Hush'd in short suspense, The plumy people streak their wings with oil, To throw the lucid moisture trickling off: And wait the approaching sign to strike, at once, Into the general choir. E'en mountains, vales, And forests seem, impatient, to demand The promised sweetness. Man superior walks Amid the glad creation, musing praise, And looking lively gratitude. At last, The clouds consign their treasures to the fields; And, softly shaking on the dimpled pool Prelusive drops, let all their moisture flow, In large effusion, o'er the freshened world. The stealing shower is scarce to patter heard, By such as wander through the forest walks, Beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves. But who can hold the shade, while Heaven descends In universal bounty, shedding herbs, And fruits, and flowers, on Nature's ample lap? Swift Fancy fired anticipates their growth; And, while the milky nutriment distils, Beholds the kindling country colour round. Thus all day long the full-distended clouds Indulge their genial stores, and well-shower'd earth Is deep enrich'd with vegetable life; Till, in the western sky, the downward sun Looks out, effulgent, from amid the flush Of broken clouds, gay-shifting to his beam. The rapid radiance instantaneous strikes The illumined mountain, through the forest streams, Shakes on the floods, and in a yellow mist, Far smoking o'er the interminable plain, In twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems. Moist, bright, and green, the landscape laughs around. Full swell the woods; their every music wakes, Mix'd in wild concert with the warbling brooks Increased, the distant bleatings of the hills, And hollow lows responsive from the vales, Whence blending all the sweeten'd zephyr springs. Meantime, refracted from yon eastern cloud, Bestriding earth, the grand ethereal bow Shoots up immense; and every hue unfolds, In fair proportion running from the red To where the violet fades into the sky. Here, awful Newton, the dissolving clouds Form, fronting on the sun, thy showery prism; And to the sage instructed eye unfold The various twine of light, by thee disclosed From the white mingling maze. Not so the boy; He wondering views the bright enchantment bend, Delightful o'er the radiant fields, and runs To catch the falling glory; but amazed Beholds the amusive arch before him fly, Then vanish quite away. Still night succeeds, A softened shade, and saturated earth Awaits the morning-beam, to give to light, Raised through ten thousand different plastic tubes, The balmy treasures of the former day. Then spring the living herbs, profusely wild, O'er all the deep-green earth, beyond the power Of botanist to number up their tribes: Whether he steals along the lonely dale, In silent search; or through the forest, rank With what the dull incurious weeds account, Bursts his blind way; or climbs the mountain rock, Fired by the nodding verdure of its brow. With such a liberal hand has Nature flung Their seeds abroad, blown them about in winds, Innumerous mix'd them with the nursing mould, The moistening current, and prolific rain. But who their virtues can declare? who pierce, With vision pure, into these secret stores Of health, and life, and joy? the food of Man, While yet he lived in innocence, and told A length of golden years; unflesh'd in blood, A stranger to the savage arts of life, Death, rapine, carnage, surfeit, and disease; The lord, and not the tyrant, of the world. The first fresh dawn then waked the gladden'd race Of uncorrupted Man, nor blush'd to see The sluggard sleep beneath its sacred beam; For their light slumbers gently fumed away; And up they rose as vigorous as the sun, Or to the culture of the willing glebe, Or to the cheerful tendance of the flock. Meantime the song went round; and dance and sport, Wisdom and friendly talk, successive, stole Their hours away: while in the rosy vale Love breath'd his infant sighs, from anguish free, And full replete with bliss; save the sweet pain, That inly thrilling, but exalts it more. Not yet injurious act, nor surly deed, Was known among those happy sons of Heaven; For reason and benevolence were law. Harmonious Nature too look'd smiling on. Clear shone the skies, cool'd with eternal gales, And balmy spirit all. The youthful sun Shot his best rays, and still the gracious clouds Dropp'd fatness down; as o'er the swelling mead The herds and flocks, commixing, play'd secure. This when, emergent from the gloomy wood, The glaring lion saw, his horrid heart Was meeken'd, and he join'd his sullen joy; For music held the whole in perfect peace: Soft sigh'd the flute; the tender voice was heard, Warbling the varied heart; the woodlands round Applied their quire; and winds and waters flow'd In consonance. Such were those prime of days. But now those white unblemish'd manners, whence The fabling poets took their golden age, Are found no more amid these iron times. These dregs of life! now the distemper'd mind Has lost that concord of harmonious powers, Which forms the soul of happiness; and all Is off the poise within: the passions all Have burst their bounds; and reason half extinct, Or impotent, or else approving, sees The foul disorder. Senseless, and deform'd, Convulsive anger storms at large; or pale, And silent, settles into fell revenge. Base envy withers at another's joy, And hates that excellence it cannot reach. Desponding fear, of feeble fancies full, Weak and unmanly, loosens every power. E'en love itself is bitterness of soul, A pensive anguish pining at the heart; Or, sunk to sordid interest, feels no more That noble wish, that never cloy'd desire, Which, selfish joy disdaining, seeks alone To bless the dearer object of its flame. Hope sickens with extravagance; and grief, Of life impatient, into madness swells; Or in dead silence wastes the weeping hours. These, and a thousand mixt emotions more, From ever changing views of good and ill, Form'd infinitely various, vex the mind With endless storm: whence, deeply rankling, grows The partial thought, a listless unconcern, Cold, and averting from our neighbour's good; Then dark disgust, and hatred, winding wiles, Coward deceit, and ruffian violence: At last, extinct each social feeling, fell And joyless inhumanity pervades And petrifies the heart. Nature disturb'd Is deem'd vindictive, to have chang'd her course. Hence, in old dusky time, a deluge came: When the deep-cleft disparting orb, that arch'd The central waters round, impetuous rush'd, With universal burst, into the gulf, And o'er the high-piled hills of fractured earth Wide dash'd the waves, in undulation vast; Till, from the centre to the streaming clouds, A shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe. The Seasons since have, with severer sway, Oppress'd a broken world: the Winter keen Shook forth his waste of snows; and Summer shot His pestilential heats. Great Spring, before, Green'd all the year; and fruits and blossoms blush'd, In social sweetness, on the selfsame bough. Pure was the temperate air; an even calm Perpetual reign'd, save what the zephyrs bland Breathed o'er the blue expanse: for then nor storms Were taught to blow, nor hurricanes to rage; Sound slept the waters; no sulphureous glooms Swell'd in the sky, and sent the lightning forth; While sickly damps and cold autumnal fogs Hung not, relaxing, on the springs of life. But now, of turbid elements the sport, From clear to cloudy tost, from hot to cold, And dry to moist, with inward-eating change, Our drooping days are dwindled down to nought, Their period finish'd ere 'tis well begun. And yet the wholesome herb neglected dies; Though with the pure exhilarating soul Of nutriment and health, and vital powers, Beyond the search of art, 'tis copious blest. For, with hot ravine fired, ensanguined man Is now become the lion of the plain, And worse. The wolf, who from the nightly fold Fierce drags the bleating prey, ne'er drunk her milk, Nor wore her warming fleece: nor has the steer, At whose strong chest the deadly tiger hangs, E'er plough'd for him. They too are temper'd high, With hunger stung and wild necessity; Nor lodges pity in their shaggy breast. But man, whom Nature form'd of milder clay, With every kind emotion in his heart, And taught alone to weep; while from her lap She pours ten thousand delicacies, herbs, And fruits, as numerous as the drops of rain Or beams that gave them birth: shall he, fair form! Who wears sweet smiles, and looks erect on Heaven, E'er stoop to mingle with the prowling herd, And dip his tongue in gore? The beast of prey, Blood-stain'd, deserves to bleed: but you, ye flocks, What have you done; ye peaceful people, what, To merit death? you, who have given us milk In luscious streams, and lent us your own coat Against the Winter's cold? and the plain ox, That harmless, honest, guileless animal, In what has he offended? he, whose toil, Patient and ever ready, clothes the land With all the pomp of harvest; shall he bleed, And struggling groan beneath the cruel hands E'en of the clown he feeds? and that, perhaps, To swell the riot of the autumnal feast, Won by his labour? Thus the feeling heart Would tenderly suggest: but 'tis enough, In this late age, adventurous, to have touch'd Light on the numbers of the Samian sage. High Heaven forbids the bold presumptuous strain, Whose wisest will has fix'd us in a state That must not yet to pure perfection rise. Now when the first foul torrent of the brooks, Swell'd with the vernal rains, is ebb'd away, And, whitening, down their mossy-tinctured stream Descends the billowy foam: now is the time, While yet the dark-brown water aids the guile, To tempt the trout. The well-dissembled fly, The rod fine-tapering with elastic spring, Snatch'd from the hoary steed the floating line, And all thy slender watry stores prepare. But let not on thy hook the tortured worm, Convulsive, twist in agonizing folds; Which, by rapacious hunger swallow'd deep, Gives, as you tear it from the bleeding breast Of the weak helpless uncomplaining wretch, Harsh pain and horror to the tender hand. When with his lively ray the potent sun Has pierced the streams, and roused the finny-race, Then, issuing cheerful, to thy sport repair; Chief should the western breezes curling play, And light o'er ether bear the shadowy clouds, High to their fount, this day, amid the hills, And woodlands warbling round, trace up the brooks; The next, pursue their rocky-channel'd maze, Down to the river, in whose ample wave Their little naiads love to sport at large. Just in the dubious point, where with the pool Is mix'd the trembling stream, or where it boils Around the stone, or from the hollow'd bank Reverted plays in undulating flow, There throw, nice-judging, the delusive fly; And as you lead it round in artful curve, With eye attentive mark the springing game. Straight as above the surface of the flood They wanton rise, or urged by hunger leap, Then fix, with gentle twitch, the barbed hook: Some lightly tossing to the grassy bank, And to the shelving shore slow dragging some, With various hand proportion'd to their force. If yet too young, and easily deceived, A worthless prey scarce bends your pliant rod, Him, piteous of his youth and the short space He has enjoy'd the vital light of Heaven, Soft disengage, and back into the stream The speckled captive throw. But should you lure From his dark haunt, beneath the tangled roots Of pendent trees, the monarch of the brook, Behoves you then to ply your finest art. Long time he, following cautious, scans the fly; And oft attempts to seize it, but as oft The dimpled water speaks his jealous fear. At last, while haply o'er the shaded sun Passes a cloud, he desperate takes the death, With sullen plunge. At once he darts along, Deep-struck, and runs out all the lengthened line; Then seeks the farthest ooze, the sheltering weed, The cavern'd bank, his old secure abode; And flies aloft, and flounces round the pool, Indignant of the guile. With yielding hand, That feels him still, yet to his furious course Gives way, you, now retiring, following now Across the stream, exhaust his idle rage: Till floating broad upon his breathless side, And to his fate abandon'd, to the shore You gaily drag your unresisting prize. Thus pass the temperate hours; but when the sun Shakes from his noon-day throne the scattering clouds, Even shooting listless langour through the deeps; Then seek the bank where flowering elders crowd, Where scatter'd wild the lily of the vale Its balmy essence breathes, where cowslips hang The dewy head, where purple violets lurk, With all the lowly children of the shade: Or lie reclined beneath yon spreading ash, Hung o'er the steep; whence, borne on liquid wing, The sounding culver shoots; or where the hawk, High, in the beetling cliff, his eyry builds. There let the classic page thy fancy lead Through rural scenes; such as the Mantuan swain Paints in the matchless harmony of song. Or catch thyself the landscape, gliding swift Athwart imagination's vivid eye: Or by the vocal woods and waters lull'd, And lost in lonely musing, in the dream, Confused, of careless solitude, where mix Ten thousand wandering images of things, Soothe every gust of passion into peace; All but the swellings of the soften'd heart, That waken, not disturb, the tranquil mind. Behold yon breathing prospect bids the Muse Throw all her beauty forth. But who can paint Like Nature? Can imagination boast, Amid its gay creation, hues like hers? Or can it mix them with that matchless skill, And lose them in each other, as appears In every bud that blows? If fancy then Unequal fails beneath the pleasing task, Ah, what shall language do? Ah, where find words Tinged with so many colours; and whose power, To life approaching, may perfume my lays With that fine oil, those aromatic gales, That inexhaustive flow continual round? Yet, though successless, will the toil delight. Come then, ye virgins and ye youths, whose hearts Have felt the raptures of refining love; And thou, Amanda, come, pride of my song! Form'd by the Graces, loveliness itself! Come with those downcast eyes, sedate and sweet, Those looks demure, that deeply pierce the soul, Where, with the light of thoughtful reason mix'd, Shines lively fancy and the feeling heart: Oh come! and while the rosy-footed May Steals blushing on, together let us tread The morning dews, and gather in their prime Fresh-blooming flowers, to grace thy braided hair, And thy loved bosom that improves their sweets. See, where the winding vale its lavish stores, Irriguous, spreads. See, how the lily drinks The latent rill, scarce oozing through the grass, Of growth luxuriant; or the humid bank, In fair profusion, decks. Long let us walk, Where the breeze blows from yon extended field Of blossom'd beans. Arabia cannot boast A fuller gale of joy, than, liberal, thence Breathes through the sense, and takes the ravished soul. Nor is the mead unworthy of thy foot, Full of fresh verdure, and unnumber'd flowers, The negligence of Nature, wide, and wild; Where, undisguised by mimic Art, she spreads Unbounded beauty to the roving eye. Here their delicious task the fervent bees, In swarming millions, tend: around, athwart, Through the soft air, the busy nations fly, Cling to the bud, and, with inserted tube, Suck its pure essence, its ethereal soul; And oft, with bolder wing, they soaring dare The purple heath, or where the wild thyme grows, And yellow load them with the luscious spoil. At length the finish'd garden to the view Its vistas opens, and its alleys green. Snatch'd through the verdant maze, the hurried eye Distracted wanders; now the bowery walk Of covert close, where scarce a speck of day Falls on the lengthen'd gloom, protracted sweeps: Now meets the bending sky; the river now Dimpling along, the breezy ruffled lake, The forest darkening round, the glittering spire, The ethereal mountain, and the distant main. But why so far excursive? when at hand, Along these blushing borders, bright with dew, And in yon mingled wilderness of flowers, Fair-handed spring unbosoms every grace; Throws out the snowdrop and the crocus first; The daisy, primrose, violet darkly blue, And polyanthus of unnumber'd dyes; The yellow wall-flower, stain'd with iron brown; And lavish stock that scents the garden round: From the soft wing of vernal breezes shed, Anemones; auriculas, enriched With shining meal o'er all their velvet leaves; And full ranunculas, of glowing red. Then comes the tulip-race, where Beauty plays Her idle freaks; from family diffused To family, as flies the father-dust, The varied colours run; and, while they break On the charm'd eye, the exulting florist marks, With secret pride, the wonders of his hand. No gradual bloom is wanting; from the bud, Firstborn of Spring, to Summer's musky tribes: Nor hyacinths, of purest virgin white, Low-bent, and blushing inward; nor jonquils, Of potent fragrance; nor Narcissus fair, As o'er the fabled fountain hanging still; Nor broad carnations, nor gay-spotted pinks; Nor, shower'd from every bush, the damask-rose. Infinite numbers, delicacies, smells, With hues on hues expression cannot paint, The breath of Nature, and her endless bloom. Hail, Source of Being! Universal Soul Of Heaven and earth! Essential Presence, hail! To Thee I bend the knee; to Thee my thoughts, Continual, climb; who, with a master-hand, Hast the great whole into perfection touched. By Thee the various vegetative tribes, Wrapt in a filmy net, and clad with leaves, Draw the live ether, and imbibe the dew: By Thee disposed into congenial soils, Stands each attractive plant, and sucks, and swells The juicy tide; a twining mass of tubes. At Thy command the vernal sun awakes The torpid sap, detruded to the root By wintry winds; that now in fluent dance, And lively fermentation, mounting, spreads All this innumerous-colour'd scene of things. As rising from the vegetable world My theme ascends, with equal wing ascend, My panting Muse; and hark, how loud the woods Invite you forth in all your gayest trim. Lend me your song, ye nightingales! oh, pour The mazy-running soul of melody Into my varied verse! while I deduce, From the first note the hollow cuckoo sings, The symphony of Spring, and touch a theme Unknown to fame,âthe passion of the groves. When first the soul of love is sent abroad, Warm through the vital air, and on the heart Harmonious seizes, the gay troops begin, In gallant thought, to plume the painted wing; And try again the long-forgotten strain, At first faint-warbled. But no sooner grows The soft infusion prevalent, and wide, Than, all alive, at once their joy o'erflows In music unconfined. Up-springs the lark, Shrill-voiced, and loud, the messenger of morn; Ere yet the shadows fly, he mounted sings Amid the dawning clouds, and from their haunts Calls up the tuneful nations. Every copse Deep-tangled, tree irregular, and bush Bending with dewy moisture, o'er the heads Of the coy quiristers that lodge within, Are prodigal of harmony. The thrush And wood-lark, o'er the kind-contending throng Superior heard, run through the sweetest length Of notes; when listening Philomela deigns To let them joy, and purposes, in thought Elate, to make her night excel their day. The black-bird whistles from the thorny brake; The mellow bullfinch answers from the grove: Nor are the linnets, o'er the flowering furze Pour'd out profusely, silent. Join'd to these Innumerous songsters, in the freshening shade Of new-sprung leaves, their modulations mix Mellifluous. The jay, the rook, the daw, And each harsh pipe, discordant heard alone, Aid the full concert: while the stock-dove breathes A melancholy murmur through the whole. 'Tis love creates their melody, and all This waste of music is the voice of love; That even to birds, and beasts, the tender arts Of pleasing teaches. Hence the glossy kind Try every winning way inventive love Can dictate, and in courtship to their mates Pour forth their little souls. First, wide around, With distant awe, in airy rings they rove, Endeavouring by a thousand tricks to catch The cunning, conscious, half-averted glance Of the regardless charmer. Should she seem Softening the least approvance to bestow, Their colours burnish, and by hope inspired, They brisk advance; then, on a sudden struck, Retire disorder'd; then again approach; In fond rotation spread the spotted wing, And shiver every feather with desire. Connubial leagues agreed, to the deep woods They haste away, all as their fancy leads, Pleasure, or food, or secret safety prompts; That Nature's great command may be obey'd: Nor all the sweet sensations they perceive Indulged in vain. Some to the holly-hedge Nestling repair, and to the thicket some; Some to the rude protection of the thorn Commit their feeble offspring. The cleft tree Offers its kind concealment to a few, Their food its insects, and its moss their nests. Others apart far in the grassy dale, Or roughening waste, their humble texture weare. But most in woodland solitudes delight, In unfrequented glooms, or shaggy banks, Steep, and divided by a babbling brook, Whose murmurs soothe them all the live-long day, When by kind duty fix'd. Among the roots Of hazel, pendent o'er the plaintive stream, They frame the first foundation of their domes; Dry sprigs of trees, in artful fabric laid, And bound with clay together. Now 'tis nought But restless hurry through the busy air, Beat by unnumber'd wings. The swallow sweeps The slimy pool, to build his hanging house Intent. And often, from the careless back Of herds and flocks, a thousand tugging bills Pluck hair and wool; and oft, when unobserved, Steal from the barn a straw: till soft and warm, Clean and complete, their habitation grows. As thus the patient dam assiduous sits, Not to be tempted from her tender task, Or by sharp hunger, or by smooth delight, Though the whole loosen'd Spring around her blows, Her sympathizing lover takes his stand High on the opponent bank, and ceaseless sings The tedious time away; or else supplies Her place a moment, while she sudden flits To pick the scanty meal. The appointed time With pious toil fulfill'd, the callow young, Warm'd and expanded into perfect life, Their brittle bondage break, and come to light, A helpless family, demanding food With constant clamour: O what passions then, What melting sentiments of kindly care, On the new parents seize! Away they fly Affectionate, and undesiring bear The most delicious morsel to their young; Which equally distributed, again The search begins. Even so a gentle pair, By fortune sunk, but form'd of generous mould, And charm'd with cares beyond the vulgar breast, In some lone cot amid the distant woods, Sustain'd alone by providential Heaven, Oft, as they weeping eye their infant train, Check their own appetites, and give them all. Nor toil alone they scorn: exalting love, By the great Father of the Spring inspired, Gives instant courage to the fearful race, And to the simple art. With stealthy wing, Should some rude foot their woody haunts molest, Amid a neighbouring bush they silent drop, And whirring thence, as if alarm'd, deceive The unfeeling schoolboy. Hence, around the head Of wandering swain, the white-wing'd plover wheels Her sounding flight, and then directly on In long excursion skims the level lawn, To tempt him from her nest. The wild-duck, hence, O'er the rough moss, and o'er the trackless waste The heath-hen flutters, pious fraud! to lead The hot pursuing spaniel far astray. Be not the Muse ashamed, here to bemoan Her brothers of the grove, by tyrant Man Inhuman caught, and in the narrow cage From liberty confined, and boundless air. Dull are the pretty slaves, their plumage dull, Ragged, and all its brightening lustre lost; Nor is that sprightly wildness in their notes, Which, clear and vigorous, warbles from the beech. O then, ye friends of love and love-taught song, Spare the soft tribes, this barbarous art forbear; If on your bosom innocence can win, Music engage, or piety persuade. But let not chief the nightingale lament Her ruin'd care too delicately framed To brook the harsh confinement of the cage. Oft when, returning with her loaded bill, The astonish'd mother finds a vacant nest, By the hard hand of unrelenting clowns Robb'd, to the ground the vain provision falls; Her pinions ruffle, and low-drooping scarce Can bear the mourner to the poplar shade; Where, all abandon'd to despair, she sings Her sorrows through the night; and, on the bough, Sole-sitting, still at every dying fall Takes up again her lamentable strain Of winding woe; till, wide around, the woods Sigh to her song, and with her wail resound. But now the feather'd youth their former bounds, Ardent, disdain; and, weighing oft their wings, Demand the free possession of the sky: This one glad office more, and then dissolves Parental love at once, now needless grown. Unlavish Wisdom never works in vain. Tis on some evening, sunny, grateful, mild, When nought but balm is breathing through the woods, With yellow lustre bright, that the new tribes Visit the spacious heavens, and look abroad On Nature's common, far as they can see, Or wing, their range and pasture. O'er the boughs Dancing about, still at the giddy verge Their resolution fails; their pinions still, In loose libration stretch'd, to trust the void Trembling refuse: till down before them fly The parent guides, and chide, exhort, command, Or push them off. The surging air receives Its plumy burden; and their self-taught wings Winnow the waving element. On ground Alighted, bolder up again they lead, Farther and farther on, the lengthening flight; Till vanish'd every fear, and every power Roused into life and action, light in air The acquitted parents see their soaring race, And once rejoicing never know them more. High from the summit of a craggy cliff, Hung o'er the deep, such as amazing frowns On utmost Kilda's The farthest of the western islands of Scotland. shore, whose lonely race Resign the setting sun to Indian worlds, The royal eagle draws his vigorous young, Strong-pounced, and ardent with paternal fire. Now fit to raise a kingdom of their own, He drives them from his fort, the towering seat, For ages, of his empire; which, in peace, Unstain'd he holds, while many a league to sea He wings his course, and preys in distant isles. Should I my steps turn to the rural seat, Whose lofty elms, and venerable oaks, Invite the rook, who high amid the boughs, In early Spring, his airy city builds, And ceaseless caws amusive; there, well-pleased, I might the various polity survey Of the mix'd household kind. The careful hen Calls all her chirping family around, Fed and defended by the fearless cock; Whose breast with ardour flames, as on he walks, Graceful, and crows defiance. In the pond, The finely checker'd duck, before her train, Rows garrulous. The stately-sailing swan Gives out his snowy plumage to the gale; And, arching proud his neck, with oary feet Bears forward fierce, and guards his osier-isle, Protective of his young. The turkey nigh, Loud-threatening, reddens; while the peacock spreads His every-colour'd glory to the sun, And swims in radiant majesty along. O'er the whole homely scene, the cooing dove Flies thick in amorous chase, and wanton rolls The glancing eye, and turns the changeful neck. While thus the gentle tenants of the shade Indulge their purer loves, the rougher world Of brutes, below, rush furious into flame, And fierce desire. Through all his lusty veins The bull, deep-scorch'd, the raging passion feels. Of pasture sick, and negligent of food, Scarce seen, he wades among the yellow broom, While o'er his ample sides the rambling spray Luxuriant shoot; or through the mazy wood Dejected wanders, nor the inticing bud Crops, though it presses on his careless sense. And oft, in jealous madening fancy wrapt, He seeks the fight; and, idly-butting, feigns His rival gored in every knotty trunk. Him should he meet, the bellowing war begins: Their eyes flash fury; to the hollow'd earth, Whence the sand flies, they mutter bloody deeds, And groaning deep, the impetuous battle mix: While the fair heifer, balmy-breathing, near, Stands kindling up their rage. The trembling steed, With this hot impulse seized in every nerve, Nor heeds the rein, nor hears the sounding thong; Blows are not felt; but tossing high his head, And by the well-known joy to distant plains Attracted strong, all wild he bursts away; O'er rocks, and woods, and craggy mountains flies; And, neighing, on the aÃ«rial summit takes The exciting gale; then, steep-descending, cleaves The headlong torrents foaming down the hills, E'en where the madness of the straiten'd stream Turns in black eddies round: such is the force With which his frantic heart and sinews swell. Nor undelighted by the boundless Spring Are the broad monsters of the foaming deep: From the deep ooze and gelid cavern roused, They flounce and tumble in unwieldy joy. Dire were the strain, and dissonant to sing The cruel raptures of the savage kind: How by this flame their native wrath sublimed, They roam, amid the fury of their heart, The far-resounding waste in fiercer bands, And growl their horrid loves. But this the theme I sing, enraptured, to the British Fair, Forbids, and leads me to the mountain-brow, Where sits the shepherd on the grassy turf, Inhaling, healthful, the descending sun. Around him feeds his many-bleating flock, Of various cadence; and his sportive lambs, This way and that convolved, in friskful glee, Their frolics play. And now the sprightly race Invites them forth; when swift, the signal given, They start away, and sweep the massy mound That runs around the hill; the rampart once Of iron war, in ancient barbarous times, When disunited Britain ever bled, Lost in eternal broil: ere yet she grew To this deep-laid indissoluble state, Where Wealth and Commerce lift their golden heads; And o'er our labours, Liberty and Law, Impartial, watch; the wonder of a world! What is this mighty breath, ye sages, say, That, in a powerful language, felt, not heard, Instructs the fowls of Heaven; and through their breast These arts of love diffuses? What, but God? Inspiring God! who boundless Spirit all, And unremitting Energy, pervades, Adjusts, sustains, and agitates the whole. He ceaseless works alone; and yet alone Seems not to work: with such perfection framed Is this complex stupendous scheme of things. But, though conceal'd, to every purer eye The informing Author in his works appears: Chief, lovely Spring, in thee, and thy soft scenes, The Smiling God is seen; while water, earth, And air attest his bounty; which exalts The brute creation to this finer thought, And annual melts their undesigning hearts Profusely thus in tenderness and joy. Still let my song a nobler note assume, And sing the infusive force of Spring on man; When heaven and earth, as if contending, vie To raise his being, and serene his soul. Can he forbear to join the general smile Of Nature? Can fierce passions vex his breast, While every gale is peace, and every grove Is melody? hence! from the bounteous walks Of flowing Spring, ye sordid sons of earth, Hard, and unfeeling of another's woe; Or only lavish to yourselves; away! But come, ye generous minds, in whose wide thought, Of all his works, creative Bounty burns With warmest beam; and on your open front And liberal eye, sits, from his dark retreat Inviting modest Want. Nor, till invoked, Can restless goodness wait: your active search Leaves no cold wintry corner unexplored; Like silent-working Heaven, surprising oft The lonely heart with unexpected good. For you the roving spirit of the wind Blows Spring abroad; for you the teeming clouds Descend in gladsome plenty o'er the world; And the sun sheds his kindest rays for you, Ye flower of human race! in these green days, Reviving Sickness lifts her languid head; Life flows afresh; and young-eyed Health exalts The whole creation round. Contentment walks The sunny glade, and feels an inward bliss Spring o'er his mind, beyond the power of kings To purchase. Pure serenity apace Induces thought, and contemplation still. By swift degrees the love of Nature works, And warms the bosom; till at last sublimed To rapture, and enthusiastic heat, We feel the present Deity, and taste The joy of God to see a happy world! These are the sacred feelings of thy heart, Thy heart inform'd by reason's purer ray, O Lyttelton, the friend! thy passions thus And meditations vary, as at large, Courting the Muse, through Hagley Park thou stray'st; The British TempÃ©! there along the dale, With woods o'erhung, and shagg'd with mossy rocks, Whence on each hand the gushing waters play, And down the rough cascade white-dashing fall, Or gleam in lengthened vista through the trees, You silent steal; or sit beneath the shade Of solemn oaks, that tuft the swelling mounts Thrown graceful round by Nature's careless hand, And pensive listen to the various voice Of rural peace: the herds, the flocks, the birds, The hollow-whispering breeze, the plaint of rills, That, purling down amid the twisted roots Which creep around, their dewy murmurs shake On the soothed ear. From these abstracted oft, You wander through the philosophic world; Where in bright train continual wonders rise, Or to the curious or the pious eye. And oft, conducted by historic truth, You tread the long extent of backward time: Planning, with warm benevolence of mind, And honest zeal unwarp'd by party-rage, Britannia's weal; how from the venal gulf To raise her virtue, and her arts revive. Or, turning thence thy view, these graver thougths The Muses charm: while, with sure taste refined, You draw the inspiring breath of ancient song; Till nobly rises, emulous, thy own. Perhaps thy loved Lucinda shares thy walk, With soul to thine attuned. Then Nature all Wears to the lover's eye a look of love; And all the tumult of a guilty world, Tost by ungenerous passions, sinks away. The tender heart is animated peace; And as it pours its copious treasures forth, In varied converse, softening every theme, You, frequent-pausing, turn, and from her eyes, Where meeken'd sense, and amiable grace, And lively sweetness dwell, enraptured, drink That nameless spirit of ethereal joy, Unutterable happiness! which love, Alone, bestows, and on a favour'd few. Meantime you gain the height, from whose fair brow The bursting prospect spreads immense around: And snatch'd o'er hill and dale, and wood and lawn, And verdant field, and darkening heath between, And villages embosom'd soft in trees, And spiry towns by surging columns mark'd Of household smoke, your eye excursive roams: Wide-stretching from the hall, in whose kind haunt The Hospitable Genius lingers still, To where the broken landscape, by degrees, Ascending, roughens into rigid hills; O'er which the Cambrian mountains, like far clouds That skirt the blue horizon, dusky rise. Flush'd by the spirit of the genial year, Now from the virgin's cheek a fresher bloom Shoots, less and less, the live carnation round; Her lips blush deeper sweets; she breathes of youth; The shining moisture swells into her eyes, In brighter flow; her wishing bosom heaves, With palpitations wild; kind tumults seize Her veins, and all her yielding soul is love. From the keen gaze her lover turns away, Full of the dear ecstatic power, and sick With sighing languishment. Ah then, ye fair! Be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts: Dare not the infectious sigh; the pleading look, Down-cast and low, in meek submission dress'd, But full of guile. Let not the fervent tongue, Prompt to deceive, with adulation smooth, Gain on your purposed will. Nor in the bower, Where woodbines flaunt, and roses shed a couch, While Evening draws her crimson curtains round, Trust your soft minutes with betraying Man. And let the aspiring youth beware of love, Of the smooth glance beware; for 'tis too late, When on his heart the torrent-softness pours; Then wisdom prostrate lies, and fading fame Dissolves in air away; while the fond soul, Wrapp'd in gay visions of unreal bliss, Still paints the illusive form; the kindling grace; The inticing smile; the modest-seeming eye, Beneath whose beauteous beams, belying Heaven, Lurk searchless cunning, cruelty, and death: And still false-warbling in his cheated ear, Her siren voice, enchanting, draws him on To guileful shores, and meads of fatal joy. E'en present, in the very lap of love Inglorious laid; while music flows around, Perfumes, and oils, and wine, and wanton hours; Amid the roses fierce Repentance rears Her snaky crest: a quick returning pang Shoots through the conscious heart; where honour still, And great design, against the oppressive load Of luxury, by fits, impatient heave. But absent, what fantastic woes, aroused, Rage in each thought, by restless musing fed, Chill the warm cheek, and blast the bloom of life? Neglected fortune flies; and sliding swift, Prone into ruin fall his scorn'd affairs. 'Tis nought but gloom around: the darken'd sun Loses his light. The rosy-bosom'd Spring To weeping fancy pines; and yon bright arch, Contracted, bends into a dusky vault. All Nature fades extinct: and she alone, Heard, felt, and seen, possesses every thought, Fills every sense, and pants in every vein. Books are but formal dulness, tedious friends; And sad amid the social band he sits, Lonely, and unattentive. From his tongue The unfinish'd period falls: while borne away On swelling thought, his wafted spirit flies To the vain bosom of his distant fair; And leaves the semblance of a lover, fix'd In melancholy site, with head declined, And love-dejected eyes. Sudden he starts, Shook from his tender trance, and restless runs To glimmering shades, and sympathetic glooms; Where the dun umbrage o'er the falling stream, Romantic, hangs; there through the pensive dusk Strays, in heart-thrilling meditation lost, Indulging all to love: or on the bank Thrown, amid drooping lilies, swells the breeze With sighs unceasing, and the brook with tears. Thus in soft anguish he consumes the day, Nor quits his deep retirement, till the Moon Peeps through the chambers of the fleecy east, Enlightened by degrees, and in her train Leads on the gentle Hours; then forth he walks, Beneath the trembling languish of her beam, With soften'd soul, and woos the bird of eve To mingle woes with his: or, while the world And all the sons of Care lie hush'd in sleep, Associates with the midnight shadows drear; And, sighing to the lonely taper, pours His idly-tortured heart into the page, Meant for the moving messenger of love; Where rapture burns on rapture, every line With rising frenzy fired. But if on bed Delirious flung, sleep from his pillow flies. All night he tosses, nor the balmy power In any posture finds; till the grey Morn Lifts her pale lustre on the paler wretch, Exanimate by love: and then perhaps Exhausted Nature sinks a while to rest, Still interrupted by distractÃ¨d dreams, That o'er the sick imagination rise, And in black colours paint the mimic scene. Oft with the enchantress of his soul he talks; Sometimes in crowds distress'd; or if retired To secret winding flower-enwoven bowers, Far from the dull impertinence of Man, Just as he, credulous, his endless cares Begins to lose in blind oblivious love, Snatch'd from her yielded hand, he knows not how, Through forests huge, and long untravel'd heaths With desolation brown, he wanders waste, In night and tempest wrapp'd: or shrinks aghast, Back, from the bending precipice; or wades The turbid stream below, and strives to reach The farther shore; where succourless, and sad, She with extended arms his aid implores; But strives in vain; borne by the outrageous flood To distance down, he rides the ridgy wave, Or whelm'd beneath the boiling eddy sinks. These are the charming agonies of love, Whose misery delights. But through the heart Should jealousy its venom once diffuse, 'Tis then delightful misery no more, But agony unmix'd incessant gall, Coroding every thought, and blasting all Love's paradise. Ye fairy prospects, then, Ye beds of roses, and ye bowers of joy, Farewell! ye gleamings of departed peace, Shine out your last! the yellow-tinging plague Internal vision taints, and in a night Of livid gloom imagination wraps. Ah then! instead of love-enliven'd cheeks, Of sunny features, and of ardent eyes With flowing rapture bright, dark looks succeed Suffused and glaring with untender fire; A clouded aspect, and a burning cheek, Where the whole poison'd soul, malignant, sits, And frightens love away. Ten thousand fears Invented wild, ten thousand frantic views Of horrid rivals, hanging on the charms For which he melts in fondness, eat him up With fervent anguish, and consuming rage. In vain reproaches lend their idle aid, Deceitful pride, and resolution frail, Giving false peace a moment. Fancy pours, Afresh, her beauties on his busy thought, Her first endearments twining round the soul, With all the witchcraft of ensnaring love. Straight the fierce storm involves his mind anew Flames through the nerves, and boils along the veins; While anxious doubt distracts the tortured heart For e'en the sad assurance of his fears Were ease to what he feels. Thus the warm youth Whom love deludes into his thorny wilds, Through flowery tempting paths, or leads a life Of fever'd rapture or of cruel care; His brightest aims extinguish'd all, and all His lively moments running down to waste. But happy they! the happiest of their kind! Whom gentler stars unite, and in one fate Their hearts, their fortunes, and their beings blend. 'Tis not the coarser tie of human laws, Unnatural oft and foreign to the mind, That binds their peace, but harmony itself, Attuning all their passions into love; Where friendship full-exerts her softest power, Perfect esteem enliven'd by desire Ineffable, and sympathy of soul; Thought meeting thought, and will preventing will, With boundless confidence: for nought but love Can answer love, and render bliss secure. Let him, ungenerous, who, alone intent To bless himself, from sordid parents buys The loathing virgin, in eternal care, Well-merited, consume his nights and days: Let barbarous nations, whose inhuman love Is wild desire, fierce as the suns they feel; Let eastern tyrants, from the light of Heaven, Seclude their bosom-slaves, meanly possess'd Of a mere lifeless, violated form: While those whom love cements in holy faith, And equal transport, free as Nature live, Disdaining fear. What is the world to them, Its pomp, its pleasure, and its nonsense all? Who in each other clasp whatever fair High fancy forms, and lavish hearts can wish; Something than beauty dearer, should they look Or on the mind, or mind-illumined face; Truth, goodness, honour, harmony, and love, The richest bounty of indulgent Heaven. Meantime a smiling offspring rises round, And mingles both their graces. By degrees, The human blossom blows; and every day, Soft as it rolls along, shows some new charm, The father's lustre, and the mother's bloom. Then infant reason grows apace, and calls For the kind hand of an assiduous care. Delightful task! to rear the tender thought, To teach the young idea how to shoot, To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind, To breathe the enlivening spirit, and to fix The generous purpose in the glowing breast. Oh, speak the joy! ye, whom the sudden tear Surprises often, while you look around, And nothing strikes your eye but sights of bliss, All various Nature pressing on the heart: An elegant sufficiency, content, Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books, Ease and alternate labour, useful life, Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven! These are the matchless joys of virtuous love; And thus their moments fly. The Seasons thus, As ceaseless round a jarring world they roll, Still find them happy; and consenting Spring Sheds her own rosy garland on their heads: Till evening comes at last, serene and mild; When after the long vernal day of life, Enamour'd more, as more remembrance swells With many a proof of recollected love, Together down they sink in social sleep; Together freed, their gentle spirits fly To scenes where love and bliss immortal reign. SUMMER. Jam clarus occultum AndromedÃ¦ pater Ostendit ignem: jam Procyon furit, Et stella vesani Leonis, Sole dies referente siccos. Jam pastor umbras cum grege languido, Rivumque fessus quÃ¦rit, et horridi Dumeta Sylvani: caretque Ripa vagis taciturna ventis. HOR. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MR. DODINGTON, ONE OF THE LORDS OF HIS MAJESTY'S TREASURY, ETC. ARGUMENT. The subject proposed. Invocation. Address to Mr. Dodington.

The whole concluding with the praise of Philosophy. From brightening fields of ether fair disclosed, Child of the Sun, refulgent Summer comes, In pride of youth, and felt through Nature's depth: He comes attended by the sultry Hours, And ever fanning breezes, on his way; While, from his ardent look, the turning Spring Averts her blushful face; and earth, and skies, All-smiling, to his hot dominion leaves. Hence, let me haste into the mid-wood shade, Where scarce a sunbeam wanders through the gloom; And on the dark-green grass, beside the brink Of haunted stream, that by the roots of oak Rolls o'er the rocky channel, lie at large, And sing the glories of the circling year. Come, Inspiration! from thy hermit-seat, By mortal seldom found: may Fancy dare, From thy fix'd serious eye, and raptured glance Shot on surrounding Heaven, to steal one look Creative of the Poet, every power Exalting to an ecstasy of soul. And thou, my youthful Muse's early friend, In whom the human graces all unite: Pure light of mind, and tenderness of heart; Genius, and wisdom; the gay social sense, By decency chastised; goodness and wit, In seldom-meeting harmony combined; Unblemish'd honour, and an active zeal For Britain's glory, liberty, and Man: O Dodington! attend my rural song, Stoop to my theme, inspirit every line, And teach me to deserve thy just applause. With what an awful world-revolving power Were first the unwieldy planets launch'd along The illimitable void! thus to remain, Amid the flux of many thousand years, That oft has swept the toiling race of men, And all their labour'd monuments away, Firm, unremitting, matchless, in their course; To the kind-temper'd change of night and day, And of the seasons ever stealing round, Minutely faithful: such the All-perfect hand! That poised, impels, and rules the steady whole. When now no more the alternate Twins are fired, And Cancer reddens with the solar blaze, Short is the doubtful empire of the night; And soon, observant of approaching day, The meek'd-eyed Morn appears, mother of dews, At first faint-gleaming in the dappled east: Till far o'er ether spreads the widening glow; And, from before the lustre of her face, White break the clouds away. With quicken'd step, Brown Night retires: young Day pours in apace, And opens all the lawny prospect wide. The dripping rock, the mountain's misty top Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn. Blue, through the dusk, the smoking currents shine; And from the bladed field the fearful hare Limps, awkward: while along the forest-glade The wild deer trip, and often turning gaze At early passenger. Music awakes The native voice of undissembled joy; And thick around the woodland hymns arise. Roused by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves His mossy cottage, where with Peace he dwells; And from the crowded fold, in order, drives His flock, to taste the verdure of the morn. Falsely luxurious! will not Man awake; And, springing from the bed of sloth, enjoy The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour, To meditation due and sacred song? For is there ought in sleep can charm the wise? To lie in dead oblivion, losing half The fleeting moments of too short a life; Total extinction of the enlightened soul! Or else to feverish vanity alive, Wilder'd, and tossing through distemper'd dreams? Who would in such a gloomy state remain Longer than Nature craves; when every Muse And every blooming pleasure wait without, To bless the wildly-devious morning-walk? But yonder comes the powerful King of Day, Rejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud, The kindling azure, and the mountain's brow Illumed with fluid gold, his near approach Betoken glad. Lo! now, apparent all, Aslant the dew-bright earth, and colour'd air, He looks in boundless majesty abroad; And sheds the shining day, that burnish'd plays On rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams, High gleaming from afar. Prime cheerer, Light! Of all material beings first, and best! Efflux divine! Nature's resplendent robe! Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt In unessential gloom; and thou, O Sun! Soul of surrounding worlds! in whom best seen Shines out thy Maker! may I sing of thee? 'Tis by thy secret, strong, attractive force, As with a chain indissoluble bound, Thy system rolls entire: from the far bourne Of utmost Saturn, wheeling wide his round Of thirty years, to Mercury, whose disk Can scarce be caught by philosophic eye, Lost in the near effulgence of thy blaze. Informer of the planetary train! Without whose quickening glance their cumbrous orbs Were brute unlovely mass, inert and dead, And not, as now, the green abodes of life! How many forms of being wait on thee! Inhaling spirit; from the unfetter'd mind, By thee sublimed, down to the daily race, The mixing myriads of thy setting beam. The vegetable world is also thine, Parent of Seasons! who the pomp precede That waits thy throne, as through thy vast domain, Annual, along the bright ecliptic road, In world-rejoicing state, it moves sublime. Meantime the expecting nations, circled gay With all the various tribes of foodful earth, Implore thy bounty, or send grateful up A common hymn: while, round thy beaming car, High-seen, the Seasons lead, in sprightly dance Harmonious knit, the rosy-finger'd Hours, The Zephyrs floating loose, the timely Rains, Of bloom ethereal the light-footed Dews, And softened into joy the surly Storms. These, in successive turn, with lavish hand, Shower every beauty, every fragrance shower, Herbs, flowers, and fruits; and, kindling at thy touch, From land to land is flush'd the vernal year. Nor to the surface of enliven'd earth, Graceful with hills and dales, and leafy woods, Her liberal tresses, is thy force confined: But, to the bowel'd cavern darting deep, The mineral kinds confess thy mighty power. Effulgent, hence the veiny marble shines; Hence Labour draws his tools; hence burnish'd War Gleams on the day; the nobler works of Peace Hence bless mankind, and generous Commerce binds The round of nations in a golden chain. The unfruitful rock itself, impregn'd by thee, In dark retirement forms the lucid stone. The lively diamond drinks thy purest rays, Collected light, compact; that, polish'd bright, And all its native lustre let abroad, Dares, as it sparkles on the fair-one's breast, With vain ambition emulate her eyes. At thee the ruby lights its deepening glow, And with a waving radiance inward flames. From thee the sapphire, solid ether, takes Its hue cerulean; and, of evening tinct, The purple-streaming amethyst is thine. With thy own smile the yellow topaz burns. Nor deeper verdure dyes the robe of Spring, When first she gives it to the southern gale, Than the green emerald shows. But, all combined, Thick through the whitening opal play thy beams; Or, flying several from its surface, form A trembling variance of revolving hues, As the site varies in the gazer's hand. The very dead creation, from thy touch, Assumes a mimic life. By thee refined, In brighter mazes the relucent stream Plays o'er the mead. The precipice abrupt, Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood, Softens at thy return. The desert joys, Wildly, through all his melancholy bounds. Rude ruins glitter; and the briny deep, Seen from some pointed promontory's top, Far to the blue horizon's utmost verge, Restless, reflects a floating gleam. But this, And all the much-transported Muse can sing, Are to thy beauty, dignity, and use, Unequal far; great delegated source Of light, and life, and grace, and joy below! How shall I then attempt to sing of Him! Who, Light Himself, in uncreated light Invested deep, dwells awfully retired From mortal eye, or angel's purer ken; Whose single smile has, from the first of time, Fill'd, overflowing, all those lamps of Heaven, That beam for ever through the boundless sky: But, should he hide his face, the astonish'd sun, And all the extinguish'd stars, would loosening reel Wide from their spheres, and Chaos come again. And yet was every faltering tongue of Man, Almighty Father! silent in thy praise; Thy Works themselves would raise a general voice, E'en in the depth of solitary woods By human foot untrod; proclaim thy power, And to the quire celestial Thee resound, The eternal cause, support, and end of all! To me be Nature's volume broad display'd; And to peruse its all instructing page, Or, haply catching inspiration thence, Some easy passage, raptured, to translate, My sole delight; as through the falling glooms Pensive I stray, or with the rising dawn On Fancy's eagle-wing excursive soar. Now, flaming up the heavens, the potent sun Melts into limpid air the high-raised clouds, And morning fogs, that hover'd round the hills In party-colour'd bands; till wide unveil'd The face of Nature shines, from where earth seems, Far-stretch'd around, to meet the bending sphere. Half in a blush of clustering roses lost, Dew-dropping Coolness to the shade retires; There, on the verdant turf, or flowery bed, By gelid founts and careless rills to muse; While tyrant Heat, dispreading through the sky, With rapid sway, his burning influence darts On man, and beast, and herb, and tepid stream. Who can unpitying see the flowery race, Shed by the morn, their new-flush'd bloom resign, Before the parching beam? so fade the fair, When fevers revel through their azure veins. But one the lofty follower of the sun, Sad when he sets, shuts up her yellow leaves, Drooping all night; and, when he warm returns, Points her enamour'd bosom to his ray. Home, from his morning task, the swain retreats; His flock before him stepping to the fold: While the full-udder'd mother lows around The cheerful cottage, then expecting food, The food of innocence and health! the daw, The rook, and magpie, to the grey-grown oaks That the calm village in their verdant arms, Sheltering, embrace, direct their lazy flight; Where on the mingling boughs they sit embower'd, All the hot noon, till cooler hours arise. Faint, underneath, the household fowls convene; And, in a corner of the buzzing shade, The house-dog, with the vacant greyhound, lies, Out-stretch'd, and sleepy. In his slumbers one Attacks the nightly thief, and one exults O'er hill and dale; till, waken'd by the wasp, They starting snap. Nor shall the Muse disdain To let the little noisy summer race Live in her lay, and flutter through her song: Not mean though simple; to the sun ally'd, From him they draw their animating fire. Waked by his warmer ray, the reptile young Come wing'd abroad; by the light air upborne, Lighter, and full of soul. From every chink And secret corner, where they slept away The wintry storms; or rising from their tombs, To higher life; by myriads, forth at once, Swarming they pour; of all the varied hues Their beauty-beaming parent can disclose. Ten thousand forms, ten thousand different tribes, People the blaze. To sunny waters some By fatal instinct fly; where on the pool They, sportive, wheel: or, sailing down the stream, Are snatch'd immediate by the quick-eyed trout, Or darting salmon. Through the green-wood glade Some love to stray; there lodged, amused, and fed, In the fresh leaf. Luxurious, others make The meads their choice, and visit every flower, And every latent herb: for the sweet task, To propagate their kinds, and where to wrap, In what soft beds, their young yet undisclosed, Employs their tender care. Some to the house, The fold, and dairy, hungry bend their flight; Sip round the pail, or taste the curdling cheese; Oft, inadvertent, from the milky stream They meet their fate; or, weltering in the bowl, With powerless wings around them wrapt, expire. But chief to heedless flies the window proves A constant death; where, gloomily retired, The villain spider lives, cunning, and fierce, Mixture abhorr'd! amid a mangled heap Of carcasses, in eager watch he sits, O'erlooking all his waving snares around. Near the dire cell the dreadless wanderer oft Passes, as oft the russian shows his front; The prey at last ensnared, he dreadful darts, With rapid glide, along the leaning line; And, fixing in the wretch his cruel fangs, Strikes backward grimly pleased; the fluttering wing And shriller sound declare extreme distress, And ask the helping hospitable hand. Resounds the living surface of the ground: Nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum, To him who muses through the woods at noon; Or drowsy shepherd, as he lies reclined, With half-shut eyes, beneath the floating shade Of willows grey, close crowding o'er the brook. Gradual, from these what numerous kinds descend, Evading e'en the microscopic eye? Full Nature swarms with life; one wondrous mass Of animals, or atoms organized, Waiting the vital breath, when parent Heaven Shall bid his spirit blow. The hoary fen, In putrid steams, emits the living cloud Of pestilence. Through subterranean cells, Where searching sunbeams scarce can find a way, Earth animated heaves. The flowery leaf Wants not its soft inhabitants. Secure, Within its winding citadel, the stone Holds multitudes. But chief the forest boughs, That dance unnumber'd to the playful breeze, The downy orchard, and the melting pulp Of mellow fruit, the nameless nations feed Of evanescent insects. Where the pool Stands mantled o'er with green, invisible, Amid the floating verdure millions stray. Each liquid too, whether it pierces, soothes, Inflames, refreshes, or exalts the taste, With various forms abounds. Nor is the stream Of purest crystal, nor the lucid air, Though one transparent vacancy it seems, Void of their unseen people. These, conceal'd By the kind art of forming Heaven, escape The grosser eye of man: for, if the worlds In worlds inclosed should on his senses burst, From cates ambrosial, and the nectar'd bowl, He would abhorrent turn; and in dead night, When silence sleeps o'er all, be stunn'd with noise. Let no presuming impious railer tax Creative Wisdom, as if ought was form'd In vain, or not for admirable ends. Shall little haughty Ignorance pronounce His works unwise, of which the smallest part Exceeds the narrow vision of her mind? As if upon a full proportion'd dome, On swelling columns heaved, the pride of art! A critic fly, whose feeble ray scarce spreads An inch around, with blind presumption bold, Should dare to tax the structure of the whole. And lives the man, whose universal eye Has swept at once the unbounded scheme of things; Mark'd their dependance so, and firm accord, As with unfaltering accent to conclude That this availeth nought? Has any seen The mighty chain of beings, lessening down From Infinite Perfection to the brink Of dreary nothing, desolate abyss! From which astonish'd thought, recoiling, turns? Till then alone let zealous praise ascend, And hymns of holy wonder, to that Power, Whose wisdom shines as lovely on our minds, As on our smiling eyes his servant-sun. Thick in yon stream of light, a thousand ways, Upward, and downward, thwarting, and convolved, The quivering nations sport; till, tempest-wing'd, Fierce Winter sweeps them from the face of day. E'en so luxurious men, unheeding, pass An idle summer life in fortune's shine, A season's glitter! thus they flutter on From toy to toy, from vanity to vice; Till, blown away by death, oblivion comes Behind, and strikes them from the book of life. Now swarms the village o'er the jovial mead: The rustic youth, brown with meridian toil, Healthful and strong; full as the summer-rose Blown by prevailing suns, the ruddy maid, Half naked, swelling on the sight, and all Her kindled graces burning o'er her cheek. E'en stooping age is here; and infant hands Trail the long rake, or, with the fragrant load O'ercharged, amid the kind oppression roll. Wide flies the tedded grain; all in a row Advancing broad, or wheeling round the field, They spread the breathing harvest to the sun, That throws refreshful round a rural smell: Or, as they rake the green-appearing ground, And drive the dusky wave along the mead, The russet hay-cock rises thick behind, In order gay. While heard from dale to dale, Waking the breeze, resounds the blended voice Of happy labour, love, and social glee. Or rushing thence, in one diffusive band, They drive the troubled flocks, by many a dog Compell'd, to where the mazy-running brook Forms a deep pool; this bank abrupt and high, And that fair-spreading in a pebbled shore. Urged to the giddy brink, much is the toil, The clamour much, of men, and boys, and dogs, Ere the soft fearful people to the flood Commit their woolly sides. And oft the swain, On some impatient seizing, hurls them in: Embolden'd then, nor hesitating more, Fast, fast, they plunge amid the flashing wave, And panting labour to the farthest shore. Repeated this, till deep the well-wash'd fleece Has drunk the flood, and from his lively haunt, The trout is banish'd by the sordid stream; Heavy, and dripping, to the breezy brow Slow more the harmless race: where, as they spread Their swelling treasures to the sunny ray, Inly disturb'd, and wondering what this wild Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints The country fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock, Incessant bleatings run around the hills. At last, of snowy white, the gather'd flocks Are in the wattled pen innumerous press'd, Head above head: and ranged in lusty rows The shepherds sit, and whet the sounding shears. The housewife waits to roll her fleecy stores, With all her gay-drest maids attending round. One, chief, in gracious dignity enthroned, Shines o'er the rest, the pastoral queen, and rays Her smiles, sweet-beaming, on her shepherd-king; While the glad circle round them yield their souls To festive mirth, and wit that knows no gall. Meantime, their joyous task goes on apace: Some mingling stir the melted tar, and some, Deep on the new-shorn vagrant's heaving side, To stamp the master's cypher ready stand; Others the unwilling wether drag along; And, glorying in his might, the sturdy boy Holds by the twisted horns the indignant ram. Behold where bound, and of its robe bereft, By needy man, that all-depending lord, How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies! What softness in its melancholy face, What dumb complaining innocence appears! Fear not, ye gentle tribes, 'tis not the knife Of horrid slaughter that is o'er you waved; No, 'tis the tender swain's well-guided shears, Who having now, to pay his annual care, Borrow'd your fleece, to you a cumbrous load, Will send you bounding to your hills again. A simple scene! yet hence Britannia sees Her solid grandeur rise: hence she commands The exalted stores of every brighter clime, The treasures of the Sun without his rage: Hence, fervent all, with culture, toil, and arts, Wide glows her land: her dreadful thunder hence Rides o'er the waves sublime, and now, e'en now, Impending hangs o'er Gallia's humbled coast; Hence rules the circling deep, and awes the world. 'Tis raging noon; and, vertical, the sun Darts on the head direct his forceful rays. O'er heaven and earth, far as the ranging eye Can sweep, a dazzling deluge reigns; and all From pole to pole is undistinguish'd blaze. In vain the sight, dejected, to the ground Stoops for relief; thence hot-ascending steams And keen reflection pain. Deep to the root Of vegetation parch'd, the cleaving fields And slippery lawn an arid hue disclose, Blast Fancy's bloom, and wither e'en the soul. Echo no more returns the cheerful sound Of sharpening scythe: the mower sinking heaps O'er him the humid hay, with flowers perfumed; And scarce a chirping grasshopper is heard Through the dumb mead. Distressful Nature pants. The very streams look languid from afar; Or, through the unshelter'd glade, impatient, seem To hurl into the covert of the grove. All-conquering Heat, oh intermit thy wrath! And on my throbbing temples potent thus Beam not so fierce! incessant still you flow, And still another fervent flood succeeds, Pour'd on the head profuse. In vain I sigh, And restless turn, and look around for night; Night is far off; and hotter hours approach. Thrice happy he! who on the sunless side Of a romantic mountain, forest-crown'd, Beneath the whole collected shade reclines: Or in the gelid caverns, woodbine-wrought, And fresh bedew'd with ever-spouting streams, Sits coolly calm; while all the world without, Unsatisfied, and sick, tosses in noon. Emblem instructive of the virtuous man, Who keeps his temper'd mind serene and pure, And every passion aptly harmonized, Amid a jarring world with vice inflamed. Welcome, ye shades! ye bowery thickets, hail! Ye lofty pines! ye venerable oaks! Ye ashes wild, resounding o'er the steep! Delicious is your shelter to the soul, As to the hunted hart the sallying spring, Or stream full-flowing, that his swelling sides Laves, as he floats along the herbaged brink. Cool, through the nerves, your pleasing comfort glides; The heart beats glad; the fresh-expanded eye And ear resume their watch; the sinews knit; And life shoots swift through all the lighten'd limbs. Around the adjoining brook, that purls along The vocal grove, now fretting o'er a rock, Now scarcely moving through a reedy pool, Now starting to a sudden stream, and now Gently diffused into a limpid plain; A various group the herds and flocks compose, Rural confusion! on the grassy bank Some ruminating lie; while others stand Half in the flood, and often bending sip The circling surface. In the middle droops The strong laborious ox, of honest front, Which incomposed he shakes; and from his sides The troublous insects lashes with his tail, Returning still. Amid his subjects safe, Slumbers the monarch-swain; his careless arm Thrown round his head, on downy moss sustain'd; Here laid his scrip, with wholesome viands fill'd; There, listening every noise, his watchful dog. Light fly his slumbers, if perchance a flight Of angry gad-flies fasten on the herd; That startling scatters from the shallow brook, In search of lavish stream. Tossing the foam, They scorn the keeper's voice, and scour the plain, Through all the bright severity of noon; While, from their labouring breasts, a hollow moan Proceeding, runs low-bellowing round the hills. Oft in this season too the horse, provoked, While his big sinews full of spirits swell, Trembling with vigour, in the heat of blood, Springs the high fence; and, o'er the field effused, Darts on the gloomy flood, with steadfast eye, And heart estranged to fear: his nervous chest, Luxuriant, and erect, the seat of strength! Bears down the opposing stream: quenchless his thirst; He takes the river at redoubled draughts; And with wide nostrils, snorting, skims the wave. Still let me pierce into the midnight depth Of yonder grove, of wildest largest growth: That, forming high in air a woodland quire, Nods o'er the mount beneath. At every step, Solemn and slow, the shadows blacker fall, And all is awful listening gloom around. These are the haunts of Meditation, these The scenes where ancient bards the inspiring breath, Ecstatic, felt; and, from this world retired, Conversed with angels, and immortal forms, On gracious errands bent: to save the fall Of virtue struggling on the brink of vice; In waking whispers, and repeated dreams, To hint pure thought, and warn the favour'd soul For future trials fated to prepare; To prompt the poet, who devoted gives His muse to better themes; to soothe the pangs Of dying worth, and from the patriot's breast (Backward to mingle in detested war, But foremost when engaged) to turn the death; And numberless such offices of love, Daily, and nightly, zealous to perform. Shook sudden from the bosom of the sky, A thousand shapes or glide athwart the dusk, Or stalk majestic on. Deep-roused, I feel A sacred terror, a severe delight, Creep through my mortal frame; and thus, me-thinks, A voice than human more, the abstracted ear Of fancy strikes:ââBe not of us afraid, Poor kindred man! thy fellow-creatures, we From the same Parent-Power our beings drew, The same our Lord, and laws, and great pursuit. Once some of us, like thee, through stormy life, Toil'd, tempest-beaten, ere we could attain This holy calm, this harmony of mind, Where purity and peace immingle charms. Then fear not us; but with responsive song, Amid these dim recesses, undisturb'd By noisy folly and discordant vice, Of Nature sing with us, and Nature's God. Here frequent, at the visionary hour, When musing midnight reigns or silent noon, Angelic harps are in full concert heard, And voices chanting from the wood-crown'd hill, The deepening dale, or inmost sylvan glade: A privilege bestow'd by us, alone, On Contemplation, or the hallow'd ear Of poet, swelling to seraphic strain.â And art thou, Stanley, A young lady, who died at the age of eighteen, in the year 1738, upon whom Thomson wrote an Epitaph. of that sacred band? Alas, for us too soon! though raised above The reach of human pain, above the flight Of human joy; yet, with a mingled ray Of sadly pleased remembrance, must thou feel A mother's love, a mother's tender woe: Who seeks thee still, in many a former scene; Seeks thy fair form, thy lovely beaming eyes, Thy pleasing converse, by gay lively sense Inspired: where moral wisdom mildly shone, Without the toil of art; and virtue glow'd, In all her smiles, without forbidding pride. But, O thou best of parents! wipe thy tears; Or rather to Parental Nature pay The tears of grateful joy, who for a while Lent thee this younger self, this opening bloom Of thy enlighten'd mind and gentle worth. Believe the Muse: the wintry blast of death Kills not the buds of virtue; no, they spread, Beneath the heavenly beam of brighter suns, Through endless ages, into higher powers. Thus up the mount, in airy vision wrapt, I stray, regardless whither; till the sound Of a near fall of water every sense Wakes from the charm of thought: swift-shrinking back, I check my steps, and view the broken scene. Smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood Rolls fair, and placid; where collected all, In one impetuous torrent, down the steep It thundering shoots, and shakes the country round. At first, an azure sheet, it rushes broad; Then whitening by degrees, as prone it falls, And from the loud-resounding rocks below Dash'd in a cloud of foam, it sends aloft A hoary mist, and forms a ceaseless shower. Nor can the tortured wave here find repose: But, raging still amid the shaggy rocks, Now flashes o'er the scatter'd fragments, now Aslant the hollow channel rapid darts; And falling fast from gradual slope to slope, With wild infracted course, and lessen'd roar, It gains a safer bed, and steals, at last, Along the mazes of the quiet vale. Invited from the cliff, to whose dark brow He clings, the steep-ascending eagle soars, With upward pinions through the flood of day; And, giving full his bosom to the blaze, Gains on the sun; while all the tuneful race, Smit by afflictive noon, disorder'd droop, Deep in the thicket; or, from bower to bower Responsive, force an interrupted strain. The stock-dove only through the forest cooes, Mournfully hoarse; oft ceasing from his plaint, Short interval of weary woe! again The sad idea of his murder'd mate, Struck from his side by savage fowler's guile, Across his fancy comes; and then resounds A louder song of sorrow through the grove. Beside the dewy border let me sit, All in the freshness of the humid air: There in that hollow'd rock, grotesque and wild, An ample chair moss-lined, and over head By flowering umbrage shaded; where the bee Strays diligent, and with the extracted balm Of fragrant woodbine loads his little thigh. Now, while I taste the sweetness of the shade, While Nature lies around deep-lull'd in noon, Now come, bold Fancy, spread a daring flight, And view the wonders of the torrid zone: Climes unrelenting! with whose rage compared, Yon blaze is feeble, and yon skies are cool. See, how at once the bright effulgent sun, Rising direct, swift chases from the sky The short-lived twilight; and with ardent blaze Looks gaily fierce through all the dazzling air: He mounts his throne; but kind before him sends, Issuing from out the portals of the morn, The general breeze Which blows constantly between the tropics from the east, or the collateral points, the north-east and south-east; caused by the pressure of the rarefied air on that before it, according to the diurnal motion of the sun from east to west., to mitigate his fire, And breathe refreshment on a fainting world. Great are the scenes, with dreadful beauty crown'd And barbarous wealth, that see, each circling year, Returning suns and double seasons In all climates between the tropics, the sun, as he passes and repasses in his annual motion, is twice a year vertical, which produces this effect. pass: Rocks rich in gems, and mountains big with mines, That on the high equator ridgy rise, Whence many a bursting stream auriferous plays: Majestic woods, of every vigorous green, Stage above stage, high waving o'er the hills; Or to the far horizon wide diffused, A boundless deep immensity of shade. Here lofty trees, to ancient song unknown, The noble sons of potent heat and floods Prone-rushing from the clouds, rear high to Heaven Their thorny stems, and broad around them throw Meridian gloom. Here, in eternal prime, Unnumber'd fruits of keen delicious taste And vital spirit, drink amid the cliffs, And burning sands that bank the shrubby vales, Redoubled day, yet in their rugged coats A friendly juice to cool its rage contain. Bear me, Pomona! to thy citron groves; To where the lemon and the piercing lime, With the deep orange, glowing through the green, Their lighter glories blend. Lay me reclined Beneath the spreading tamarind that shakes, Fann'd by the breeze, its fever-cooling fruit. Deep in the night the massy locust sheds, Quench my hot limbs; or lead me through the maze, Embowering endless, of the Indian fig; Or thrown at gayer ease, on some fair brow, Let me behold, by breezy murmurs cool'd, Broad o'er my head the verdant cedar wave, And high palmetos lift their graceful shade. Or stretch'd amid these orchards of the sun, Give me to drain the cocoa's milky bowl, And from the palm to draw its freshening wine! More bounteous far than all the frantic juice Which Bacchus pours. Nor, on its slender twigs Low-bending, be the full pomegranate scorn'd; Nor, creeping through the woods, the gelid race Of berries. Oft in humble station dwells Unboastful worth, above fastidious pomp. Witness, thou best Anana, thou the pride Of vegetable life, beyond whate'er The poets imaged in the golden age: Quick let me strip thee of thy tufty coat, Spread thy ambrosial stores, and feast with Jove! From these the prospect varies. Plains immense Lie stretch'd below, interminable meads, And vast savannahs, where the wandering eye, Unfix'd, is in a verdant ocean lost. Another Flora there, of bolder hues, And richer sweets, beyond our garden's pride, Plays o'er the fields, and showers with sudden hand Exuberant spring: for oft these valleys shift Their green embroider'd robe to fiery brown, And swift to green again, as scorching suns, Or streaming dews and torrent rains, prevail. Along these lonely regions, where, retired From little scenes of art, great Nature dwells In awful solitude, and nought is seen But the wild herds that own no master's stall, Prodigious rivers roll their fattening seas: On whose luxuriant herbage, half-conceal'd, Like a fallen cedar, far diffused his train, Cased in green scales, the crocodile extends. The flood disparts: behold! in plaited mail Behemoth The hippopotamus, or river-horse. rears his head. Glanced from his side, The darted steel in idle shivers flies: He fearless walks the plain, or seeks the hills; Where, as he crops his varied fare, the herds, In widening circle round, forget their food, And at the harmless stranger wondering gaze. Peaceful, beneath primeval trees, that cast Their ample shade o'er Niger's yellow stream, And where the Ganges rolls his sacred wave; Or mid the central depth of blackening woods, High raised in solemn theatre around, Leans the huge elephant: wisest of brutes! O truly wise, with gentle might endow'd, Though powerful, not destructive! here he sees Revolving ages sweep the changeful earth, And empires rise and fall; regardless he Of what the never-resting race of men Project: thrice happy! could he 'scape their guile, Who mine, from cruel avarice, his steps; Or with his towery grandeur swell their state, The pride of kings! or else his strength pervert, And bid him rage amid the mortal fray, Astonish'd at the madness of mankind. Wide o'er the winding umbrage of the floods, Like vivid blossoms glowing from afar, Thick swarm the brighter birds. For Nature's hand, That with a sportive vanity has deck'd The plumy nations, there her gayest hues Profusely pours. In all the regions of the torrid zone the birds, though more beautiful in their plumage, are observed to be less melodious than ours. But, if she bids them shine, Array'd in all the beauteous beams of day, Yet frugal still, she humbles them in song. Nor envy we the gaudy robes they lent Proud Montezuma's realm, whose legions cast A boundless radiance waving on the sun, While Philomel is ours; while in our shades, Through the soft silence of the listening night, The sober-suited songstress trills her lay. But come, my Muse, the desert-barrier burst, A wild expanse of lifeless sand and sky: And, swifter than the toiling caravan, Shoot o'er the vale of Sennar; ardent climb The Nubian mountains, and the secret bounds Of jealous Abyssinia boldly pierce. Thou art no ruffian, who beneath the mask Of social commerce comest to rob their wealth; No holy fury thou, blaspheming Heaven, With consecrated steel to stab their peace, And through the land, yet red from civil wounds, To spread the purple tyranny of Rome. Thou, like the harmless bee, mayst freely range, From mead to mead bright with exalted flowers, From jasmine grove to grove mayst wander gay, Through palmy shades and aromatic woods, That grace the plains, invest the peopled hills, And up the more than Alpine mountains wave. There on the breezy summit, spreading fair, For many a league; or on stupendous rocks, That from the sun-redoubling valley lift, Cool to the middle air, their lawny tops; Where palaces, and fanes, and villas rise; And gardens smile around, and cultured fields; And fountains gush; and careless herds and flocks Securely stray; a world within itself, Disdaining all assault: there let me draw Ethereal soul, there drink reviving gales, Profusely breathing from the spicy groves, And vales of fragrance; there at distance hear The roaring floods, and cataracts, that sweep From disembowel'd earth the virgin gold; And o'er the varied landscape, restless, rove, Fervent with life of every fairer kind: A land of wonders! which the sun still eyes With ray direct, as of the lovely realm Enamour'd, and delighting there to dwell. How changed the scene! in blazing height of noon, The sun, oppress'd, is plunged in thickest gloom. Still horror reigns, a dreary twilight round, Of struggling night and day malignant mix'd. For to the hot equator crowding fast, Where, highly rarefied, the yielding air Admits their stream, incessant vapours roll, Amazing clouds on clouds continual heap'd; Or whirl'd tempestuous by the gusty wind, Or silent borne along, heavy, and slow, With the big stores of steaming oceans charged. Meantime, amid these upper seas, condensed Around the cold aÃ«rial mountain's brow, And by conflicting winds together dash'd, The thunder holds his black tremendous throne; From cloud to cloud the rending lightnings rage; Till, in the furious elemental war Dissolved, the whole precipitated mass Unbroken floods and solid torrents pours. The treasures these, hid from the bounded search Of ancient knowledge; whence, with annual pomp, Rich king of floods! o'erflows the swelling Nile. From his two springs, in Gojam's sunny realm, Pure-welling out, he through the lucid lake Of fair Dambea rolls his infant stream. There, by the naiads nursed, he sports away His playful youth, amid the fragant isles, That with unfading verdure smile around. Ambitious, thence the manly river breaks; And gathering many a flood, and copious fed With all the mellow'd treasures of the sky, Winds in progressive majesty along: Through splendid kingdoms now devolves his maze, Now wanders wild o'er solitary tracts Of life-deserted sand; till, glad to quit The joyless desert, down the Nubian rocks From thundering steep to steep, he pours his urn, And Egypt joys beneath the spreading wave. His brother Niger too, and all the floods In which the full-form'd maids of Afric lave Their jetty limbs; and all that from the tract Of woody mountains stretch'd through gorgeous Fall on Cor'mandel's coast, or Malabar; From Menam's The river that runs through Siam: on whose banks a vast multitude of those insects, called fire-flies, make a beautiful appearance in the night. orient stream, that nightly shines With insect-lamps, to where Aurora sheds On Indus' smiling banks the rosy shower: All, at this bounteous season, ope their urns, And pour untoiling harvest o'er the land. Nor less thy world, Columbus, drinks, refresh'd, The lavish moisture of the melting year. Wide o'er his isles, the branching Oronoque Rolls a brown deluge; and the native drives To dwell aloft on life-sufficing trees, At once his dome, his robe, his food, and arms. Swell'd by a thousand streams, impetuous hurl'd From all the roaring Andes, huge decends The mighty Orellana. The river of the Amazons. Scarce the Muse Dares stretch her wing o'er this enormous mass Of rushing water; scarce she dares attempt The sea-like Plata; to whose dread expanse, Continuous depth, and wondrous length of course, Our floods are rills. With unabated force, In silent dignity they sweep along, And traverse realms unknown, and blooming wilds, And fruitful deserts, worlds of solitude, Where the sun smiles and seasons teem in vain, Unseen and unenjoy'd. Forsaking these, O'er peopled plains they fair-diffusive flow, And many a nation feed, and circle safe, In their soft bosom, many a happy isle; The seat of blameless Pan, yet undisturb'd By christian crimes and Europe's cruel sons. Thus pouring on they proudly seek the deep, Whose vanquish'd tide recoiling from the shock, Yields to the liquid weight of half the globe; And Ocean trembles for his green domain. But what avails this wondrous waste of wealth? This gay profusion of luxurious bliss? This pomp of Nature? what their balmy meads, Their powerful herbs, and Ceres void of pain? By vagrant birds dispersed and wafting winds, What their unplanted fruits? what the cool draughts, The ambrosial food, rich gums, and spicy health, Their forests yield? their toiling insects what? Their silky pride, and vegetable robes? Ah! what avail their fatal treasures, hid Deep in the bowels of the pitying earth, Golconda's gems, and sad Potosi's mines; Where dwelt the gentlest children of the sun? What all that Afric's golden rivers roll, Her odorous woods, and shining ivory stores? Ill-fated race! the softening arts of Peace, Whate'er the humanizing Muses teach; The godlike wisdom of the temper'd breast; Progressive truth, the patient force of thought; Investigation calm, whose silent powers Command the world; the light that leads to Heaven; Kind equal rule, the goverment of laws, And all-protecting Freedom, which alone Sustains the name and dignity of man: These are not theirs. The parent sun himself Seems o'er this world of slaves to tyrannize; And, with oppressive ray, the roseate bloom Of beauty blasting, gives the gloomy hue, And feature gross: or worse, to ruthless deeds, Mad jealousy, blind rage, and fell revenge, Their fervid spirit fires. Love dwells not there, The soft regards, the tenderness of life, The heart-shed tear, the ineffable delight Of sweet humanity: these court the beam Of milder climes; in selfish fierce desire, And the wild fury of voluptuous sense, There lost. The very brute-creation there This rage partakes, and burns with horrid fire. Lo! the green serpent, from his dark abode, Which even Imagination fears to tread, At noon forth-issuing, gathers up his train In orbs immense, then, darting out anew, Seeks the refreshing fount; by which diffused, He throws his folds: and while, with threatening tongue And deathful jaws erect, the monster curls His flaming crest, all other thirst appall'd, Or shivering flies or check'd at distance stands, Nor dares approach. But still more direful he, The small close-lurking minister of fate, Whose high-concocted venom through the veins A rapid lightning darts, arresting swift The vital current. Form'd to humble man, This child of vengeful Nature! there, sublimed To fearless lust of blood, the savage race Roam, licensed by the shading hour of guilt, And foul misdeed, when the pure day has shut His sacred eye. The tiger darting fierce Impetuous on the prey his glance has doom'd: The lively shining leopard, speckled o'er With many a spot, the beauty of the waste; And, scorning all the taming arts of man, The keen hyena, fellest of the fell. These, rushing from the inhospitable woods Of Mauritania, or the tufted isles, That verdant rise amid the Libyan wild, Innumerous glare around their shaggy king, Majestic, stalking o'er the printed sand; And, with imperious and repeated roars, Demand their fated food. The fearful flocks Crowd near the guardian swain; the nobler herds, Where round their lordly bull, in rural ease They ruminating lie, with horror hear The coming rage. The awaken'd village starts; And to her fluttering breast the mother strains Her thoughtless infant. From the pyrate's den, Or stern Morocco's tyrant fang escaped, The wretch half wishes for his bonds again: While, uproar all, the wilderness resounds, From Atlas eastward to the frighted Nile. Unhappy he! who from the first of joys, Society, cut off, is left alone Amid this world of death. Day after day, Sad on the jutting eminence he sits, And views the main that ever toils below; Still fondly forming in the farthest verge, Where the round ether mixes with the wave, Ships, dim-discover'd dropping from the clouds; At evening, to the setting sun he turns A mournful eye, and down his dying heart Sinks helpless; while the wonted roar is up, And hiss continual through the tedious night. Yet here, e'en here, into these black abodes Of monsters, unappall'd, from stooping Rome, And guilty CÃ¦sar, Liberty retired, Her Cato following through Numidian wilds: Disdainful of Campania's gentle plains, And all the green delights Ausonia pours; When for them she must bend the servile knee, And fawning take the splendid robber's boon. Nor stop the terrors of these regions here. Commission'd demons oft, angels of wrath, Let loose the raging elements. Breathed hot From all the boundless furnace of the sky, And the wide glittering waste of burning sand, A suffocating wind the pilgrim smites With instant death. Patient of thirst and toil, Son of the desert! e'en the camel feels, Shot through his wither'd heart, the fiery blast. Or from the black-red ether, bursting broad, Sallies the sudden whirlwind. Straight the sands, Commoved around, in gathering eddies play: Nearer and nearer still they darkening come; Till, with the general all-involving storm Swept up, the whole continuous wilds arise; And by their noonday fount dejected thrown, Or sunk at night in sad disastrous sleep, Beneath descending hills, the caravan Is buried deep. In Cairo's crowded streets The impatient merchant, wondering, waits in vain, And Mecca saddens at the long delay. But chief at sea, whose every flexile wave Obeys the blast, the aÃ«rial tumult swells. In the dread ocean, undulating wide, Beneath the radiant line that girts the globe, The circling Typhon Typhon and Ecnephia, names of particular storms or hurricanes, known only between the tropics., whirl'd from point to point, Exhausting all the rage of all the sky, And dire Ecnephia Typhon and Ecnephia, names of particular storms or hurricanes, known only between the tropics. reign. Amid the heavens, Falsely serene, deep in a cloudy speck Called by sailors the Ox-eye, being in appearance at first no bigger. Compress'd, the mighty tempest brooding dwells: Of no regard, save to the skilful eye, Fiery and foul, the small prognostic hangs Aloft, or on the promontory's brow Musters its force. A faint deceitful calm, A fluttering gale, the demon sends before, To tempt the spreading sail. Then down at once, Precipitant, descends a mingled mass Of roaring winds, and flame, and rushing floods. In wild amazement fix'd the sailor stands. Art is too slow: by rapid fate oppress'd, His broad-winged vessel drinks the whelming tide, Hid in the bosom of the black abyss. With such mad seas the daring Gama Vasco de Gama, the first who sailed round Africa, by the Cape of Good Hope, to the East Indies. fought, For many a day, and many a dreadful night, Incessant, labouring round the stormy Cape; By bold ambition led, and bolder thirst Of gold. For then from ancient gloom emerged The rising world of trade: the Genius, then, Of navigation, that, in hopeless sloth, Had slumber'd on the vast Atlantic deep, For idle ages, starting, heard at last The Lusitanian Prince; Don Henry, third son to John the First, King of Portugal. His strong genius to the discovery of new countries was the chief source of all the modern improvements in navigation. who, Heaven-inspired, To love of useful glory roused mankind, And in unbounded commerce mix'd the world. Increasing still the terrors of these storms, His jaws horrific arm'd with threefold fate, Here dwells the direful shark. Lured by the scent Of steaming crowds, of rank disease, and death, Behold! he rushing cuts the briny flood, Swift as the gale can bear the ship along; And, from the partners of that cruel trade, Which spoils unhappy Guinea of her sons, Demands his share of prey; demands themselves. The stormy fates descend: one death involves Tyrants and slaves; when straight, their mangled limbs Crashing at once, he dyes the purple seas With gore, and riots in the vengeful meal. When o'er this world, by equinoctial rains Flooded immense, looks out the joyless sun, And draws the copious stream: from swampy fens, Where putrefaction into life ferments, And breathes destructive myriads; or from woods, Impenetrable shades, recesses foul, In vapours rank and blue corruption wrapt, Whose gloomy horrors yet no desperate foot Has ever dared to pierce; then, wasteful, forth Walks the dire Power of pestilent disease. A thousand hideous fiends her course attend, Sick Nature blasting, and to heartless woe, And feeble desolation, casting down The towering hopes and all the pride of Man. Such as, of late, at Carthagena quench'd The British fire. You, gallant Vernon, saw The miserable scene; you, pitying, saw To infant-weakness sunk the warrior's arm; Saw the deep-racking pang, the ghastly form, The lip pale quivering, and the beamless eye No more with ardour bright: you heard the groans Of agonizing ships, from shore to shore; Heard, nightly plunged amid the sullen waves, The frequent corse; while on each other fix'd, In sad presage, the blank assistants seem'd, Silent, to ask, whom Fate would next demand. What need I mention those inclement skies, Where, frequent o'er the sickening city, Plague, The fiercest child of Nemesis divine, Descends? From Ethiopia's poison'd woods, From stifled Cairo's filth, and fetid fields With locust-armies putrefying heap'd, This great destroyer sprung. Her awful rage The brutes escape: Man is her destined prey, Intemperate Man! and, o'er his guilty domes, She draws a close incumbent cloud of death; Uninterrupted by the living winds, Forbid to blow a wholesome breeze; and stain'd With many a mixture by the sun, suffused, Of angry aspect. Princely wisdom, then, Dejects his watchful eye; and from the hand Of feeble justice, ineffectual, drop The sword and balance: mute the voice of joy, And hush'd the clamour of the busy world. Empty the streets, with uncouth verdure clad; Into the worst of deserts sudden turn'd The cheerful haunt of men: unless escaped From the doom'd house, where matchless horror reigns, Shut up by barbarous fear, the smitten wretch, With frenzy wild, breaks loose; and, loud to Heaven Screaming, the dreadful policy arraigns, Inhuman, and unwise. The sullen door, Yet uninfected, on its cautious hinge Fearing to turn, abhors society: Dependants, friends, relations, Love himself, Savaged by woe, forget the tender tie, The sweet engagement of the feeling heart. But vain their selfish care: the circling sky, The wide enlivening air is full of fate; And, struck by turns, in solitary pangs They fall, unblest, untended, and unmourn'd. Thus o'er the prostrate city black Despair Extends her raven wing: while, to complete The scene of desolation, stretch'd around, The grim guards stand, denying all retreat, And give the flying wretch a better death. Much yet remains unsung: the rage intense Of brazen-vaulted skies, of iron fields, Where drought and famine starve the blasted year: Fired by the torch of noon to tenfold rage, The infuriate hill that shoots the pillar'd flame; And, roused within the subterranean world, The expanding earthquake, that resistless shakes Aspiring cities from their solid base, And buries mountains in the flaming gulf. But 'tis enough; return, my vagrant Muse: A nearer scene of horror calls thee home. Behold, slow-settling o'er the lurid grove Unusual darkness broods; and growing gains The full possession of the sky, surcharged With wrathful vapour, from the secret beds, Where sleep the mineral generations, drawn. Thence nitre, sulphur, and the fiery spume Of fat bitumen, steaming on the day, With various-tinctured trains of latent flame, Pollute the sky, and in yon baleful cloud, A reddening gloom, a magazine of fate, Ferment; till, by the touch ethereal roused, The dash of clouds, or irritating war Of fighting winds, while all is calm below, They furious spring. A boding silence reigns, Dread through the dun expanse; save the dull sound That from the mountain, previous to the storm, Rolls o'er the muttering earth, disturbs the flood, And shakes the forest-leaf without a breath. Prone, to the lowest vale, the aÃ«rial tribes Descend: the tempest-loving raven scarce Dares wing the dubious dusk. In rueful gaze The cattle stand, and on the scowling heavens Cast a deploring eye; by man forsook, Who to the crowded cottage hies him fast, Or seeks the shelter of the downward cave. 'Tis listening fear, and dumb amazement all: When to the startled eye the sudden glance Appears far south, eruptive through the cloud; And following slower, in explosion vast, The Thunder raises his tremendous voice. At first, heard solemn o'er the verge of Heaven, The tempest growls; but as it nearer comes, And rolls its awful burden on the wind, The lightnings flash a larger curve, and more The noise astounds: till over head a sheet Of livid flame discloses wide; then shuts, And opens wider; shuts and opens still Expansive, wrapping ether in a blaze. Follows the loosen'd aggravated roar, Enlarging, deepening, mingling; peal on peal Crush'd horrible, convulsing heaven and earth. Down comes a deluge of sonorous hail, Or prone-descending rain. Wide-rent, the clouds Pour a whole flood; and yet, its flame unquench'd, The unconquerable lightning struggles through, Ragged and fierce, or in red whirling balls, And fires the mountains with redoubled rage. Black from the stroke, above, the smouldring pine Stands a sad shatter'd trunk; and, stretch'd below, A lifeless group the blasted cattle lie: Here the soft flocks, with that same harmless look They wore alive, and ruminating still In fancy's eye; and there the frowning bull, And ox half-raised. Struck on the castled cliff, The venerable tower and spiry fane Resign their aged pride. The gloomy woods Start at the flash, and from their deep recess, Wide-flaming out, their trembling inmates shake. Amid Carnarvon's mountains rages loud The repercussive roar: with mighty crush, Into the flashing deep, from the rude rocks Of Penmanmaur heap'd hideous to the sky, Tumble the smitten cliffs; and Snowden's peak, Dissolving, instant yields his wintry load. Far seen, the heights of heathy Cheviot blaze, And ThulÃ¨ bellows through her utmost isles. Guilt hears appall'd, with deeply troubled thought. And yet not always on the guilty head Descends the fated flash. Young Celadon And his Amelia were a matchless pair; With equal virtue form'd, and equal grace, The same, distinguish'd by their sex alone: Hers the mild lustre of the blooming morn, And his the radiance of the risen day. They lov'd: but such the guileless passion was, As in the dawn of time inform'd the heart Of innocence and undissembling truth. 'Twas friendship, heighten'd by the mutual wish; The enchanting hope, and sympathetic glow, Beam'd from the mutual eye. Devoting all To love, each was to each a dearer self; Supremely happy in the awaken'd power Of giving joy. Alone, amid the shades, Still in harmonious intercourse they lived The rural day, and talk'd the flowing heart, Or sigh'd and look'd unutterable things. So pass'd their life, a clear united stream, By care unruffled; till, in evil hour, The tempest caught them on the tender walk, Heedless how far and where its mazes stray'd, While, with each other blest, creative love Still bade eternal Eden smile around. Presaging instant fate, her bosom heaved Unwonted sighs, and stealing oft a look Of the big gloom, on Celadon her eye Fell tearful, wetting her disorder'd cheek. In vain assuring love, and confidence In Heaven, repress'd her fear; it grew, and shook Her frame near dissolution. He perceived The unequal conflict, and as angels look On dying saints, his eyes compassion shed, With love illumined high. âFear not,â he said, âSweet innocence! thou stranger to offence, And inward storm! He, who yon skies involves In frowns of darkness, ever smiles on thee With kind regard. O'er thee the secret shaft That wastes at midnight, or the undreaded hour Of noon, flies harmless: and that very voice, Which thunders terror through the guilty heart, With tongues of seraphs whispers peace to thine. 'Tis safety to be near thee sure, and thus To clasp perfection!â From his void embrace, (Mysterious Heaven!) that moment, to the ground, A blacken'd corse, was struck the beauteous maid. But who can paint the lover, as he stood, Pierced by severe amazement, hating life, Speechless, and fix'd in all the death of woe! So, faint resemblance! on the marble tomb, The well-dissembled mourner stooping stands, For ever silent and for ever sad. As from the face of Heaven the shatter'd clouds Tumultuous rove, the interminable sky Sublimer swells, and o'er the world expands A purer azure. Through the lighten'd air A higher lustre and a clearer calm, Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign Of danger past, a glittering robe of joy, Set off abundant by the yellow ray, Invests the fields; and nature smiles revived. 'Tis beauty all, and grateful song around, Join'd to the low of kine, and numerous bleat Of flocks thick-nibbling through the clover'd vale. And shall the hymn be marr'd by thankless Man, Most-favour'd! who with voice articulate Should lead the chorus of this lower world; Shall he, so soon forgetful of the Hand That hush'd the thunder, and serenes the sky, Extinguish'd feel that spark the tempest waked, That sense of powers exceeding far his own, Ere yet his feeble heart has lost its fears? Cheer'd by the milder beam, the sprightly youth Speeds to the well-known pool, whose crystal depth A sandy bottom shows. Awhile he stands Gazing the inverted landscape, half afraid To meditate the blue profound below; Then plunges headlong down the circling flood. His ebon tresses, and his rosy cheek Instant emerge; and through the obedient wave, At each short breathing by his lip repell'd, With arms and legs according well, he makes, As humour leads, an easy-winding path; While, from his polish'd sides, a dewy light Effuses on the pleased spectators round. This is the purest exercise of health, The kind refresher of the summer-heats; Nor when cold Winter keens the brightening flood, Would I weak-shivering linger on the brink. Thus life redoubles, and is oft preserved, By the bold swimmer, in the swift elapse Of accident disastrous. Hence the limbs Knit into force; and the same Roman arm, That rose victorious o'er the conquer'd earth, First learn'd, while tender, to subdue the wave. Even from the body's purity the mind Receives a secret sympathetic aid. Close in the covert of a hazel copse, Where, winded into pleasing solitudes, Runs out the rambling dale, young Damon sat, Pensive, and pierced with love's delightful pangs. There to the stream that down the distant rocks Hoarse-murmuring fell, and plaintive breeze that play'd Among the bending willows, falsely he Of Musidora's cruelty complain'd. She felt his flame; but deep within her breast In bashful coyness, or in maiden pride, The soft return conceal'd; save when it stole In sidelong glances from her downcast eye, Or from her swelling soul in stifled sighs. Touch'd by the scene, no stranger to his vows, He framed a melting lay, to try her heart; And, if an infant passion struggled there, To call that passion forth. Thrice happy swain! A lucky chance, that oft decides the fate Of mighty monarchs, then decided thine. For lo! conducted by the laughing Loves, This cool retreat his Musidora sought: Warm in her cheek the sultry season glow'd; And, robed in loose array, she came to bathe Her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream. What shall he do? In sweet confusion lost, And dubious flutterings, he a while remain'd: A pure ingenuous elegance of soul, A delicate refinement, known to few, Perplex'd his breast, and urged him to retire: But love forbade. Ye prudes in virtue, say, Say, ye severest, what would you have done? Meantime, this fairer nymph than ever blest Arcadian stream, with timid eye around The banks surveying, stripp'd her beauteous limbs, To taste the lucid coolness of the flood. Ah then! not Paris on the piny top Of Ida panted stronger, when aside The rival-goddesses the veil divine Cast unconfined, and gave him all their charms, Than, Damon, thou; as from the snowy leg, And slender foot, the inverted silk she drew; As the soft touch dissolved the virgin zone: And, through the parting robe, the alternate breast, With youth wild-throbbing, on thy lawless gaze In full luxuriance rose. But, desperate youth, How durst thou risk the soul-distracting view, As from her naked limbs of glowing white, Harmonious swell'd by Nature's finest hand, In folds loose floating fell the fainter lawn; And fair exposed she stood, shrunk from herself, With fancy blushing, at the doubtful breeze Alarm'd, and starting like the fearful fawn? Then to the flood she rush'd; the parted flood Its lovely guest with closing waves received; And every beauty softening, every grace Flushing anew, a mellow lustre shed: As shines the lily through the crystal mild; Or as the rose amid the morning dew, Fresh from Aurora's hand, more sweetly glows, While thus she wanton'd, now beneath the wave But ill-conceal'd; and now with streaming locks, That half-embraced her in a humid veil, Rising again, the latent Damon drew Such madening draughts of beauty to the soul, As for a while o'erwhelm'd his raptured thought With luxury too daring. Check'd, at last, By love's respectful modesty, he deem'd The theft profane, if aught profane to love Can e'er be deem'd; and, struggling from the shade, With headlong hurry fled: but first these lines, Traced by his ready pencil, on the bank With trembling hand he threw:ââBathe on, my fair, Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt, To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot, And each licentious eye.â With wild surprise, As if to marble struck, devoid of sense, A stupid moment motionless she stood: So stands the statue The Venus of Medici. that enchants the world, So bending tries to veil the matchless boast, The mingled beauties of exulting Greece. Recovering, swift she flew to find those robes Which blissful Eden knew not; and, array'd In careless haste, the alarming paper snatch'd. But, when her Damon's well known hand she saw, Her terrors vanish'd, and a softer train Of mix'd emotions, hard to be described, Her sudden bosom seized: shame void of guilt, The charming blush of innocence, esteem, And admiration of her lover's flame, By modesty exalted: e'en a sense Of self-approving beauty stole across Her busy thought. At length a tender calm Hush'd by degrees the tumult of her soul; And on the spreading beech, that o'er the stream Incumbent hung, she with the sylvan pen Of rural lovers this confession carved, Which soon her Damon kiss'd with weeping joy: âDear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean, By fortune too much favour'd, but by love, Alas! not favour'd less, be still as now Discreet: the time may come you need not fly.â The sun has lost his rage: his downward orb Shoots nothing now but animating warmth And vital lustre; that with various ray Lights up the clouds, those beauteous robes of Heaven, Incessant roll'd into romantic shapes, The dream of waking fancy! broad below, Cover'd with ripening fruits, and swelling fast Into the perfect year, the pregnant earth And all her tribes rejoice. Now the soft hour Of walking comes: for him who lonely loves To seek the distant hills, and there converse With Nature; there to harmonize his heart, And in pathetic song to breathe around The harmony to others. Social friends, Attuned to happy unison of soul; To whose exalting eye a fairer world, Of which the vulgar never had a glimpse, Displays its charms; whose minds are richly fraught With philosophic stores, superior light; And in whose breast, enthusiastic, burns Virtue, the sons of interest deem romance; Now call'd abroad enjoy the falling day: Now to the verdant Portico of woods, To Nature's vast Lyceum forth they walk; By that kind School where no proud master reigns, The full free converse of the friendly heart, Improving and improved. Now from the world, Sacred to sweet retirement, lovers steal, And pour their souls in transport, which the Sire Of love approving hears, and calls it good. Which way, Amanda, shall we bend our course? The choice perplexes. Wherefore should we choose? All is the same with thee. Say, shall we wind Along the streams? or walk the smiling mead? Or court the forest glades? or wander wild Among the waving harvests? or ascend, While radiant Summer opens all its pride, Thy hill, delightful Shene? The old name of Richmond, signifying in Saxon, Shining, or Splendor. Here let us sweep The boundless landscape: now the raptured eye, Exulting swift, to huge Augusta send, Now to the Sister-Hills Highgate and Hampstead. that skirt her plain, To lofty Harrow now, and now to where Majestic Windsor lifts his princely brow. In lovely constrast to this glorious view Calmly magnificent, then will we turn To where the silver Thames first rural grows. There let the feasted eye unwearied stray: Luxurious, there, rove through the pendent woods That nodding hang o'er Harrington's retreat; And, stooping thence to Ham's embowering walks, Beneath whose shades, in spotless peace retired, With Her the pleasing partner of his heart, The worthy Queensberry yet laments his Gay, And polish'd Cornbury woos the willing Muse, Slow let us trace the matchless vale of Thames; Fair winding up to where the Muses haunt In Twit'nam's bowers, and for their Pope implore The healing God; In his last sickness. to royal Hampton's pile, To Clermont's terraced height, and Esher's groves, Where in the sweetest solitude, embraced By the soft windings of the silent Mole, From courts and senates Pelham finds repose. Inchanting vale! beyond whate'er the Muse Has of Achaia or Hesperia sung! O vale of bliss! O softly swelling hills! On which the Power of Cultivation lies, And joys to see the wonders of his toil. Heavens! what a goodly prospect spreads around, Of hills, and dales, and woods, and lawns, and spires, And glittering towns, and gilded streams, till all The stretching landscape into smoke decays! Happy Britannia! where the Queen of Arts, Inspiring vigour, Liberty abroad Walks, unconfined, even to thy farthest cots, And scatters plenty with unsparing hand. Rich is thy soil, and merciful thy clime; Thy streams unfailing in the Summer's drought; Unmatch'd thy guardian oaks; thy valleys float With golden waves: and on thy mountains flocks Bleat numberless! while, roving round their sides, Bellow the blackening herds in lusty droves. Beneath, thy meadows glow, and rise unquell'd Against the mower's scythe. On every hand Thy villas shine. Thy country teems with wealth; And property assures it to the swain, Pleased and unwearied, in his guarded toil. Full are thy cities with the sons of Art; And trade and joy, in every busy street, Mingling are heard; e'en Drudgery himself, As at the car he sweats, or dusty hews The palace stone, looks gay. Thy crowded ports, Where rising masts an endless prospect yield, With labour burn, and echo to the shouts Of hurried sailor, as he hearty waves His last adieu, and loosening every sheet, Resigns the spreading vessel to the wind. Bold, firm, and graceful are thy generous youth, By hardship sinew'd, and by danger fired, Scattering the nations where they go; and first Or on the listed plain, or stormy seas. Mild are thy glories too, as o'er the plans Of thriving peace thy thoughtful sires preside; In genius, and substantial learning, high; For every virtue, every worth renown'd; Sincere, plain-hearted, hospitable, kind; Yet like the mustering thunder when provoked, The dread of tyrants, and the sole resource Of those that under grim oppression groan. Thy sons of Glory many! Alfred thine, In whom the splendour of heroic war, And more heroic peace, when govern'd well, Combine; whose hallow'd name the Virtues saint, And his own Muses love; the best of kings! With him thy Edwards and thy Henries shine, Names dear to fame; the first who deep impress'd On haughty Gaul the terror of thy arms, That awes her genius still. In statesmen thou, And patriots, fertile. Thine a steady More, Who, with a generous though mistaken zeal, Withstood a brutal tyrant's useful rage, Like Cato firm, like Aristides just, Like rigid Cincinnatus nobly poor, A dauntless soul erect, who smiled on death. Frugal and wise, a Walsingham is thine, A Drake, who made thee mistress of the deep, And bore thy name in thunder round the world. Then flamed thy spirit high: but who can speak The numerous worthies of the Maiden Reign? In Raleigh mark their every glory mix'd; Raleigh, the scourge of Spain! whose breast with all The sage, the patriot, and the hero burn'd, Nor sunk his vigour, when a coward-reign The warrior fetter'd, and at last resign'd, To glut the vengeance of a vanquish'd foe. Then active still and unrestrain'd, his mind Explored the vast extent of ages past, And with his prison-hours enrich'd the world; Yet found no times, in all the long research, So glorious, or so base, as those he proved, In which he conquer'd, and in which he bled. Nor can the Muse the gallant Sidney pass, The plume of war! with early laurels crown'd, The lover's myrtle, and the poet's bay. A Hampden too is thine, illustrious land, Wise, strenuous, firm, of unsubmitting soul, Who stemm'd the torrent of a downward age To slavery prone, and bade thee rise again, In all thy native pomp of freedom bold. Bright, at his call, thy Age of Men effulged, Of Men on whom late time a kindling eye Shall turn, and tyrants tremble while they read. Bring every sweetest flower, and let me strew The grave where Russel lies; whose temper'd blood With calmest cheerfulness for thee resign'd, Stain'd the sad annals of a giddy reign; Aiming at lawless power, though meanly sunk In loose inglorious luxury. With him His friend, the British Cassius, Algernon Sidney. fearless bled; Of high determined spirit, roughly brave, By ancient learning to the enlighten'd love Of ancient freedom warm'd. Fair thy renown In awful sages and in noble bards; Soon as the light of dawning Science spread Her orient ray, and waked the Muses' song. Thine is a Bacon; hapless in his choice, Unfit to stand the civil storm of state, And through the smooth barbarity of courts, With firm but pliant virtue, forward still To urge his course: him for the studious shade Kind Nature form'd, deep, comprehensive, clear, Exact, and elegant: in one rich soul, Plato, the Stagyrite, and Tully join'd. The great deliverer he! who from the gloom Of cloister'd monks, and jargon-teaching schools, Let forth the true Philosophy, there long Held in the magic chain of words and forms, And definitions void: he led her forth, Daughter of Heaven! that slow-ascending still, Investigating sure the chain of things, With radiant finger points to Heaven again. The generous Ashley Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury. thine, the friend of man; Who scann'd his nature with a brother's eye, His weakness prompt to shade, to raise his aim, To touch the finer movements of the mind, And with the moral beauty charm the heart. Why need I name thy Boyle, whose pious search Amid the dark recesses of his works, The great Creator sought? And why thy Locke, Who made the whole internal world his own? Let Newton, pure intelligence, whom God To mortals lent, to trace His boundless works From laws sublimely simple, speak thy fame In all philosophy. For lofty sense, Creative fancy, and inspection keen Through the deep windings of the human heart, Is not wild Shakespeare thine and Nature's boast? Is not each great, each amiable Muse Of classic ages in thy Milton met? A genius universal as his theme; Astonishing as chaos, as the bloom Of blowing Eden fair, as Heaven sublime! Nor shall my verse that elder bard forget, The gentle Spenser, Fancy's pleasing son; Who, like a copious river, pour'd his song O'er all the mazes of enchanted ground: Nor thee, his ancient master, laughing sage, Chaucer, whose native manners-painting verse, Well moralized, shines through the gothic cloud Of time and language o'er thy genius thrown. May my song soften, as thy daughters I, Britannia, hail! for beauty is their own, The feeling heart, simplicity of life, And elegance, and taste: the faultless form, Shaped by the hand of harmony; the cheek, Where the live crimson, through the native white Soft-shooting, o'er the face diffuses bloom, And every nameless grace; the parted lip, Like the red rose bud moist with morning dew, Breathing delight; and, under flowing jet, Or sunny ringlets, or of circling brown, The neck slight-shaded, and the swelling breast; The look resistless, piercing to the soul, And by the soul inform'd, when dress'd in love She sits high-smiling in the conscious eye. Island of bliss! amid the subject seas, That thunder round thy rocky coasts, set up, At once the wonder, terror, and delight Of distant nations; whose remotest shores Can soon be shaken by thy naval arm; Not to be shook thyself, but all assaults Baffling, as thy hoar cliffs the loud sea-wave. O Thou! by whose Almighty nod the scale Of empire rises, or alternate falls, Send forth the saving Virtues round the land, In bright patrol: white Peace, and social Love; The tender-looking Charity, intent On gentle deeds, and shedding tears through smiles; Undaunted Truth, and Dignity of mind: Courage composed, and keen; sound Temperance, Healthful in heart and look; clear Chastity, With blushes reddening as she moves along, Disorder'd at the deep regard she draws; Rough Industry; Activity untired, With copious life inform'd, and all awake: While in the radiant front, superior shines That first paternal virtue, Public Zeal; Who throws o'er all an equal wide survey, And, ever musing on the common weal, Still labours glorious with some great design. Low walks the sun, and broadens by degrees, Just o'er the verge of day. The shifting clouds Assembled gay, a richly gorgeous train, In all their pomp attend his setting throne. Air, earth, and ocean smile immense. And now, As if his weary chariot sought the bowers Of AmphitritÃ¨, and her tending nymphs, (So Grecian fable sung) he dips his orb; Now half-immersed; and now a golden curve Gives one bright glance, then total disappears. For ever running an enchanted round, Passes the day, deceitful, vain, and void; As fleets the vision o'er the formful brain, This moment hurrying wild the impassion'd soul, The next in nothing lost. 'Tis so to him, The dreamer of this earth, an idle blank: A sight of horror to the cruel wretch, Who all day long in sordid pleasure roll'd, Himself a useless load, has squander'd vile, Upon his scoundrel train, what might have cheer'd A drooping family of modest worth. But to the generous still-improving mind, That gives the hopeless heart to sing for joy, Diffusing kind beneficence around, Boastless, as now descends the silent dew; To him the long review of order'd life Is inward rapture, only to be felt. Confess'd from yonder slow-extinguish'd clouds, All ether softening, sober Evening takes Her wonted station in the middle air; A thousand shadows at her beck. First this She sends on earth; then that of deeper dye Steals soft behind; and then a deeper still, In circle following circle, gathers round, To close the face of things. A fresher gale Begins to wave the wood, and stir the stream, Sweeping with shadowy gust the fields of corn; While the quail clamours for his running mate. Wide o'er the thistly lawn, as swells the breeze, A whitening shower of vegetable down Amusive floats. The kind impartial care Of Nature nought disdains: thoughtful to feed Her lowest sons, and clothe the coming year, From field to field the feather'd seeds she wings. His folded flock secure, the shepherd home Hies, merry-hearted; and by turns relieves The ruddy milk-maid of her brimming pail; The beauty whom perhaps his witless heart, Unknowing what the joy-mix'd anguish means, Sincerely loves, by that best language shown Of cordial glances, and obliging deeds. Onward they pass, o'er many a panting height, And valley sunk, and unfrequented; where At fall of eve the fairy people throng, In various game, and revelry, to pass The summer night, as village-stories tell. But far about they wander from the grave Of him, whom his ungentle fortune urged Against his own sad breast to lift the hand Of impious violence. The lonely tower Is also shunn'd; whose mournful chambers hold, So night-struck Fancy dreams, the yelling ghost. Among the crooked lanes, on every hedge, The glowworm lights his gem; and through the dark A moving radiance twinkles. Evening yields The world to Night; not in her winter-robe Of massy stygian woof, but loose array'd In mantle dun. A faint erroneous ray, Glanced from the imperfect surfaces of things, Flings half an image on the straining eye; While wavering woods, and villages, and streams, And rocks, and mountain-tops, that long retain'd The ascending gleam, are all one swimming scene, Uncertain if beheld. Sudden to Heaven Thence weary vision turns; where, leading soft The silent hours of love, with purest ray Sweet Venus shines; and from her genial rise, When day-light sickens till it springs afresh, Unrival'd reigns, the fairest lamp of Night. As thus the effulgence tremulous I drink, With cherish'd gaze, the lambent lightnings shoot Across the sky; or horizontal dart In wondrous shapes: by fearful murmuring crowds Portentous deem'd. Amid the radiant orbs, That more than deck, that animate the sky, The life-infusing suns of other worlds; Lo! from the dread immensity of space Returning, with accelerated course, The rushing comet to the sun descends; And as he sinks below the shading earth, With awful train projected o'er the heavens, The guilty nations tremble. But, above Those superstitious horrors that enslave The fond sequacious herd, to mystic faith And blind amazement prone, the enlighten'd few, Whose godlike minds Philosophy exalts, The glorious stranger hail. They feel a joy Divinely great; they in their powers exult, That wondrous force of thought, which mounting spurns This dusky spot, and measures all the sky; While, from his far excursion through the wilds Of barren ether, faithful to his time, They see the blazing wonder rise anew, In seeming terror clad, but kindly bent To work the will of all-sustaining Love: From his huge vapoury train perhaps to shake Reviving moisture on the numerous orbs, Through which his long ellipsis winds; perhaps To lend new fuel to declining suns, To light up worlds, and feed the eternal fire. With thee, serene Philosophy, with thee, And thy bright garland, let me crown my song! Effusive source of evidence, and truth! A lustre shedding o'er the ennobled mind, Stronger than summer-noon; and pure as that, Whose mild vibrations soothe the parted soul, New to the dawning of celestial day. Hence through her nourish'd powers, enlarged by thee, She springs aloft, with elevated pride, Above the tangling mass of low desires, That bind the fluttering crowd; and, angel-wing'd, The heights of science and of virtue gains, Where all is calm and clear; with Nature round, Or in the starry regions, or the abyss, To Reason's and to Fancy's eye display'd: The First up-tracing, from the dreary void, The chain of causes and effects to Him, The world-producing Essence, who alone Possesses being; while the Last receives The whole magnificence of heaven and earth, And every beauty, delicate or bold, Obvious or more remote, with livelier sense, Diffusive painted on the rapid mind. Tutor'd by thee, hence Poetry exalts Her voice to ages; and informs the page With music, image, sentiment, and thought, Never to die! the treasure of mankind! Their highest honour, and their truest joy! Without thee what were unenlighten'd Man? A savage roaming through the woods and wilds, In quest of prey; and with the unfashion'd fur Rough-clad; devoid of every finer art, And elegance of life. Nor happiness Domestic, mix'd of tenderness and care, Nor moral excellence, nor social bliss, Nor guardian law were his; nor various skill To turn the furrow, or to guide the tool Mechanic; nor the heaven-conducted prow Of navigation bold, that fearless braves The burning line or dares the wintry pole; Mother severe of infinite delights! Nothing, save rapine, indolence, and guile, And woes on woes, a still-revolving train! Whose horrid circle had made human life Than non-existence worse: but, taught by thee, Ours are the plans of policy and peace; To live like brothers, and conjunctive all Embellish life. While thus laborious crowds Ply the tough oar, Philosophy directs The ruling helm; or like the liberal breath Of potent Heaven, invisible, the sail Swells out, and bears the inferior world along. Nor to this evanescent speck of earth Poorly confined, the radiant tracts on high Are her exalted range; intent to gaze Creation through; and, from that full complex Of never ending wonders, to conceive Of the Sole Being right, who spoke the Word, And Nature moved complete. With inward view, Thence on the ideal kingdom swift she turns Her eye; and instant, at her powerful glance, The obedient phantoms vanish or appear; Compound, divide, and into order shift, Each to his rank, from plain perception up To the fair forms of Fancy's fleeting train: To reason then, deducing truth from truth; And notion quite abstract; where first begins The world of spirits, action all, and life Unfetter'd, and unmixt. But here the cloud, (So wills Eternal Providence) sits deep. Enough for us to know that this dark state, In wayward passions lost and vain pursuits, This Infancy of Being, cannot prove The final issue of the works of God, By boundless Love and perfect Wisdom form'd, And ever rising with the rising mind. AUTUMN. INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ARTHUR ONSLOW, ESQ. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. ARGUMENT. The subject proposed. Addressed to Mr. Onslow. A prospect of the Fields ready for Harvest. Reflections in praise of Industry raised by that view. Reaping. A Tale relative to it. A Harvest Storm. Shooting and Hunting; their barbarity. A ludicrous account of Foxhunting. A view of an Orchard. Wall Fruit. A Vineyard. A description of Fogs, frequent in the latter part of Autumn; whence a digression, inquiring into the rise of Fountains and Rivers. Birds of season considered, that now shift their Habitation. The prodigious number of them that cover the Northern and Western Isles of Scotland. Hence a view of the Country. A prospect of the discoloured, fading Woods. After a gentle dusky day, Moonlight. Autumnal Meteors. Morning: to which succeeds a calm, pure, sunshiny Day, such as usually shuts up the season. The Harvest being gathered in, the Country dissolved in joy. The whole concludes with a Panegyric on a philosophical Country Life. Crown'd with the sickle and the wheaten sheaf, While Autumn, nodding o'er the yellow plain, Comes jovial on; the Doric reed once more, Well pleased, I tune. Whate'er the wintry frost Nitrous prepared; the various blossom'd Spring Put in white promise forth; and Summer-suns Concocted strong, rush boundless now to view, Full, perfect all, and swell my glorious theme. Onslow! the Muse, ambitious of thy name, To grace, inspire, and dignify her song, Would from the public voice thy gentle ear A while engage. Thy noble cares she knows, The patriot virtues that distend thy thought, Spread on thy front, and in thy bosom glow; While listening senates hang upon thy tongue, Devolving through the maze of eloquence A roll of periods, sweeter than her song. But she too pants for public virtue, she, Though weak of power, yet strong in ardent will, Whene'er her country rushes on her heart, Assumes a bolder note, and fondly tries To mix the patriot's with the poet's flame. When the bright Virgin gives the beauteous days, And Libra weighs in equal scales the year; From Heaven's high cope the fierce effulgence shook Of parting Summer, a serener blue, With golden light enliven'd, wide invests The happy world. Attemper'd suns arise, Sweet-beam'd, and shedding oft through lucid clouds A pleasing calm; while broad, and brown, below Extensive harvests hang the heavy head. Rich, silent, deep, they stand; for not a gale Rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain: A calm of plenty! till the ruffled air Falls from its poise, and gives the breeze to blow. Rent is the fleecy mantle of the sky; The clouds fly different; and the sudden sun By fits effulgent gilds the illumined field, And black by fits the shadows sweep along. A gaily chequer'd heart-expanding view, Far as the circling eye can shoot around, Unbounded tossing in a flood of corn. These are thy blessings, Industry! rough power! Whom labour still attends, and sweat, and pain; Yet the kind source of every gentle art, And all the soft civility of life: Raiser of human kind! by Nature cast, Naked, and helpless, out amid the woods And wilds, to rude inclement elements; With various seeds of art deep in the mind Implanted, and profusely pour'd around Materials infinite, but idle all. Still unexerted, in the unconscious breast, Slept the lethargic powers; Corruption still, Voracious, swallow'd what the liberal hand Of bounty scatter'd o'er the savage year: And still the sad barbarian, roving, mix'd With beasts of prey; or for his acorn-meal Fought the fierce tusky boar; a shivering wretch! Aghast, and comfortless, when the bleak north, With Winter charged, let the mix'd tempest fly, Hail, rain, and snow, and bitter-breathing frost: Then to the shelter of the hut he fled; And the wild season, sordid, pined away. For home he had not; home is the resort Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where, Supporting and supported, polish'd friends, And dear relations mingle into bliss. But this the rugged savage never felt, E'en desolate in crowds; and thus his days Roll'd heavy, dark, and unenjoy'd along: A waste of time! till Industry approach'd, And roused him from his miserable sloth: His faculties unfolded; pointed out, Where lavish Nature the directing hand Of art demanded; show'd him how to raise His feeble force by the mechanic powers, To dig the mineral from the vaulted earth, On what to turn the piercing rage of fire, On what the torrent, and the gather'd blast; Gave the tall ancient forest to his axe; Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the stone, Till by degrees the finish'd fabric rose; Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur, And wrapt them in the woolly vestment warm, Or bright in glossy silk, and flowing lawn; With wholesome viands fill'd his table, pour'd The generous glass around, inspired to wake The life-refining soul of decent wit: Nor stopp'd at barren bare necessity; But still advancing bolder, led him on To pomp, to pleasure, elegance, and grace; And, breathing high ambition through his soul, Set science, wisdom, glory, in his view, And bade him be the Lord of all below. Then gathering men their natural powers combined, And form'd a Public; to the general good Submitting, aiming, and conducting all. For this the Patriot-Council met, the full, The free, and fairly represented Whole; For this they plann'd the holy guardian laws, Distinguish'd orders, animated arts, And with joint force Oppression chaining, set Imperial Justice at the helm; yet still To them accountable: nor slavish dream'd That toiling millions must resign their weal, And all the honey of their search, to such As for themselves alone themselves have raised. Hence every form of cultivated life In order set, protected, and inspired, Into perfection wrought. Uniting all, Society grew numerous, high, polite, And happy. Nurse of art! the city rear'd In beauteous pride her tower-encircled head; And, stretching street on street, by thousands drew, From twining woody haunts, or the tough yew To bows strong-straining, her aspiring sons. Then Commerce brought into the public walk The busy merchant; the big warehouse built; Raised the strong crane; choked up the loaded street With foreign plenty; and thy stream, O Thames, Large, gentle, deep, majestic, king of floods! Chose for his grand resort. On either hand, Like a long wintry forest, groves of masts Shot up their spires; the bellying sheet between Possess'd the breezy void; the sooty hulk Steer'd sluggish on; the splendid barge along Row'd, regular, to harmony; around, The boat, light-skimming, stretch'd its oary wings; While deep the various voice of fervent toil From bank to bank increased; whence ribb'd with oak, To bear the British thunder, black, and bold, The roaring vessel rush'd into the main. Then too the pillar'd dome, magnific, heaved Its ample roof; and Luxury within Pour'd out her glittering stores: the canvass smooth, With glowing life protuberant, to the view Embodied rose; the statue seem'd to breathe, And soften into flesh; beneath the touch Of forming art, imagination-flush'd. All is the gift of Industry; whate'er Exalts, embellishes, and renders life Delightful. Pensive Winter cheer'd by him Sits at the social fire, and happy hears The excluded tempest idly rave along; His harden'd fingers deck the gaudy Spring; Without him Summer were an arid waste; Nor to the Autumnal months could thus transmit Those full, mature, immeasurable stores, That, waving round, recall my wandering song. Soon as the morning trembles o'er the sky, And, unperceived, unfolds the spreading day; Before the ripen'd field the reapers stand, In fair array, each by the lass he loves, To bear the rougher part, and mitigate By nameless gentle offices her toil. At once they stoop, and swell the lusty sheaves; While through their cheerful band the rural talk, The rural scandal, and the rural jest, Fly harmless, to deceive the tedious time, And steal unfelt the sultry hours away. Behind the master walks, builds up the shocks; And, conscious, glancing oft on every side His sated eye, feels his heart heave with joy. The gleaners spread around, and here and there, Spike after spike, their scanty harvest pick. Be not too narrow, husbandmen! but fling From the full sheaf, with charitable stealth, The liberal handful. Think, oh grateful think! How good the God of Harvest is to you; Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields; While these unhappy partners of your kind Wide-hover round you, like the fowls of heaven, And ask their humble dole. The various turns Of fortune ponder; that your sons may want What now, with hard reluctance, faint, ye give. The lovely young Lavinia once had friends; And Fortune smiled, deceitful, on her birth. For, in her helpless years deprived of all, Of every stay, save Innocence and Heaven, She with her widow'd mother, feeble, old, And poor, lived in a cottage, far retired Among the windings of a woody vale; By solitude and deep surrounding shades, But more by bashful modesty, conceal'd. Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn Which virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet From giddy passion and low-minded pride: Almost on Nature's common bounty fed; Like the gay birds that sung them to repose, Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare. Her form was fresher than the morning rose, When the dew wets its leaves; unstain'd and pure As is the lily, or the mountain snow. The modest Virtues mingled in her eyes, Still on the ground dejected, darting all Their humid beams into the blooming flowers: Or when the mournful tale her mother told, Of what her faithless fortune promised once, Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy star Of evening, shone in tears. A native grace Sat fair-proportion'd on her polish'd limbs, Veil'd in a simple robe, their best attire, Beyond the pomp of dress; for loveliness Needs not the foreign aid of ornament, But is when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most. Thoughtless of beauty, she was Beauty's self, Recluse amid the close-embowering woods. As in the hollow breast of Appenine, Beneath the shelter of encircling hills, A myrtle rises, far from human eye, And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild; So flourish'd blooming, and unseen by all, The sweet Lavinia; till, at length, compell'd By strong Necessity's supreme command, With smiling patience in her looks, she went To glean Palemon's fields. The pride of swains Palemon was, the generous, and the rich; Who led the rural life in all its joy And elegance, such as Arcadian song Transmits from ancient uncorrupted times; When tyrant custom had not shackled man, But free to follow Nature was the mode. He then, his fancy with autumnal scenes Amusing, chanced beside his reaper-train To walk, when poor Lavinia drew his eye; Unconcious of her power, and turning quick With unaffected blushes from his gaze: He saw her charming, but he saw not half The charms her down-cast modesty conceal'd. That very moment love and chaste desire Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown; For still the world prevail'd and its dread laugh, Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn, Should his heart own a gleaner in the field; And thus in secret to his soul he sigh'd:â âWhat pity! that so delicate a form, By beauty kindled, where enlivening sense And more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell, Should be devoted to the rude embrace Of some indecent clown! She looks, methinks, Of old Acasto's line; and to my mind Recalls that patron of my happy life, From whom my liberal fortune took its rise; Now to the dust gone down; his houses, lands, And once fair-spreading family, dissolved. 'Tis said that in some lone obscure retreat, Urged by remembrance sad, and decent pride, Far from those scenes which knew their better days, His aged widow and his daughter live, Whom yet my fruitless search could never find. Romantic wish! would this the daughter were!â When, strict inquiring, from herself he found She was the same, the daughter of his friend, Of bountiful Acasto; who can speak The mingled passions that surprised his heart, And through his nerves in shivering transport ran? Then blazed his smother'd flame, avow'd, and bold; And as he view'd her, ardent, o'er and o'er, Love, gratitude, and pity wept at once. Confused, and frighten'd at his sudden tears, Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom, As thus Palemon, passionate and just, Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul: âAnd art thou then Acasto's dear remains? She, whom my restless gratitude has sought, So long in vain? O heavens! the very same, The soften'd image of my noble friend; Alive his every look, his every feature, More elegantly touch'd. Sweeter than Spring! Thou sole surviving blossom from the root That nourish'd up my fortune! say, ah where, In what sequester'd desert hast thou drawn The kindest aspect of delighted Heaven? Into such beauty spread, and blown so fair; Though Poverty's cold wind and crushing rain Beat keen and heavy on thy tender years? O let me now into a richer soil Transplant thee safe! where vernal suns and showers Diffuse their warmest, largest influence; And of my garden be the pride and joy! Ill it befits thee, oh, it ill befits Acasto's daughter, his, whose open stores, Though vast, were little to his ampler heart, The father of a country, thus to pick The very refuse of those harvest fields, Which from his bounteous friendship I enjoy. Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand, But ill applied to such a rugged task; The fields, the master, all, my fair, are thine; If to the various blessings which thy house Has on me lavish'd, thou wilt add that bliss, That dearest bliss, the power of blessing thee!â Here ceased the youth: yet still his speaking eye Express'd the sacred triumph of his soul, With conscious virtue, gratitude, and love, Above the vulgar joy divinely raised. Nor waited he reply. Won by the charm Of goodness irresistible, and all In sweet disorder lost, she blush'd consent. The news immediate to her mother brought, While, pierced with anxious thought, she pined away The lonely moments for Lavinia's fate; Amazed, and scarce believing what she heard, Joy seized her wither'd veins, and one bright gleam Of setting life shone on her evening-hours: Not less enraptured than the happy pair; Who flourish'd long in tender bliss, and rear'd A numerous offspring, lovely like themselves, And good, the grace of all the country round. Defeating oft the labours of the year, The sultry south collects a potent blast. At first, the groves are scarcely seen to stir Their trembling tops; and a still murmur runs Along the soft-inclining fields of corn. But as the aÃ«rial tempest fuller swells, And in one mighty stream, invisible, Immense, the whole excited atmosphere Impetuous rushes o'er the sounding world; Strain'd to the root, the stooping forest pours A rustling shower of yet untimely leaves. High beat, the circling mountains eddy in, From the bare wild, the dissipated storm, And send it in a torrent down the vale. Exposed, and naked, to its utmost rage, Through all the sea of harvest rolling round, The billowy plain floats wide; nor can evade, Though pliant to the blast, its seizing force; Or whirl'd in air, or into vacant chaff Shook waste. And sometimes too a burst of rain, Swept from the black horizon, broad, descends In one continuous flood. Still over head The mingling tempest weaves its gloom, and still The deluge deepens; till the fields around Lie sunk, and flatted, in the sordid wave. Sudden, the ditches swell; the meadows swim. Red, from the hills, innumerable streams Tumultuous roar; and high above its banks The river lift; before whose rushing tide Herds, flocks, and harvests, cottages, and swains, Roll mingled down; all that the winds had spared In one wild moment ruin'd; the big hopes, And well earn'd treasures of the painful year. Fled to some eminence, the husbandman Helpless beholds the miserable wreck Driving along; his drowning ox at once Descending, with his labours scatter'd round, He sees; and instant o'er his shivering thought Comes Winter unprovided, and a train Of claimant children dear. Ye masters, then, Be mindful of the rough laborious hand That sinks you soft in elegance and ease; Be mindful of those limbs in russet clad, Whose toil to yours is warmth and graceful pride; And, oh! be mindful of that sparing board, Which covers yours with luxury profuse, Makes your glass sparkle, and your sense rejoice! Nor cruelly demand what the deep rains And all-involving winds have swept away. Here the rude clamour of the sportsman's joy, The gun fast-thundering, and the winded horn, Would tempt the muse to sing the rural game: How in his mid-career the spaniel struck, Stiff, by the tainted gale, with open nose, Outstretch'd and finely sensible, draws full, Fearful and cautious, on the latent prey; As in the sun the circling covey bask Their varied plumes, and watchful every way, Through the rough stubble turn the secret eye. Caught in the meshy snare, in vain they beat Their idle wings, entangled more and more: Nor on the surges of the boundless air, Though borne triumphant, are they safe; the gun, Glanced just, and sudden, from the fowler's eye, O'ertakes their sounding pinions: and again, Immediate, brings them from the towering wing, Dead to the ground; or drives them wide dispersed, Wounded, and wheeling various, down the wind. These are not subjects for the peaceful Muse, Nor will she stain with such her spotless song; Then most delighted, when she social sees The whole mix'd animal-creation round Alive and happy. 'Tis not joy to her, The falsely cheerful barbarous game of death, This rage of pleasure, which the restless youth Awakes, impatient, with the gleaming morn: When beasts of prey retire, that all night long, Urged by necessity, had ranged the dark, As if their conscious ravage shunn'd the light, Ashamed. Not so the steady tyrant Man, Who with the thoughtless insolence of power Inflamed, beyond the most infuriate wrath Of the worst monster that e'er roam'd the waste, For sport alone pursues the cruel chase, Amid the beamings of the gentle days. Upbraid, ye ravening tribes, our wanton rage, For hunger kindles you, and lawless want; But lavish fed, in Nature's bounty roll'd, To joy at anguish, and delight in blood, Is what your horrid bosoms never knew. Poor is the triumph o'er the timid hare! Scared from the corn, and now to some lone seat Retired: the rushy fen; the ragged furze, Stretch'd o'er the stony heath; the stubble chapt; The thistly lawn; the thick entangled broom; Of the same friendly hue, the wither'd fern; The fallow ground laid open to the sun, Concoctive; and the nodding sandy bank, Hung o'er the mazes of the mountain brook. Vain is her best precaution; though she sits Conceal'd, with folded ears; unsleeping eyes, By Nature raised to take the horizon in; And head couch'd close betwixt her hairy feet, In act to spring away. The scented dew Betrays her early labyrinth; and deep, In scatter'd sullen openings, far behind, With every breeze she hears the coming storm. But nearer, and more frequent, as it loads The sighing gale, she springs amazed, and all The savage soul of game is up at once: The pack full-opening, various; the shrill horn Resounded from the hills; the neighing steed, Wild for the chase; and the loud hunter's shout; O'er a weak, harmless, flying creature, all Mix'd in mad tumult, and discordant joy. The stag too, singled from the herd, where long He ranged the branching monarch of the shades, Before the tempest drives. At first, in speed He, sprightly, puts his faith; and, roused by fear, Gives all his swift aÃ«rial soul to flight; Against the breeze he darts, that way the more To leave the lessening murderous cry behind: Deception short! though fleeter than the winds Blown o'er the keen-air'd mountain by the north, He bursts the thickets, glances through the glades, And plunges deep into the wildest wood; If slow, yet sure, adhesive to the track Hot-steaming, up behind him come again The inhuman rout, and from the shady depth Expel him, circling through his every shift. He sweeps the forest oft; and sobbing sees The glades, mild opening to the golden day; Where, in kind contest, with his butting friends He wont to struggle, or his loves enjoy. Oft in the full-descending flood he tries To lose the scent, and lave his burning sides: Oft seeks the herd; the watchful herd, alarm'd, With selfish care avoid a brother's woe. What shall he do? His once so vivid nerves, So full of buoyant spirit, now no more Inspire the course; but fainting breathless toil, Sick, seizes on his heart: he stands at bay; And puts his last weak refuge in despair. The big round tears run down his dappled face; He groans in anguish: while the growling pack, Blood-happy, hang at his fair jutting chest, And mark his beauteous chequer'd sides with gore. Of this enough. But if the sylvan youth, Whose fervent blood boils into violence, Must have the chase; behold, despising flight, The roused up lion, resolute, and slow, Advancing full on the protended spear, And coward band, that circling wheel aloof. Slunk from the cavern, and the troubled wood, See the grim wolf; on him his shaggy foe Vindictive fix, and let the ruffian die: Or, growling horrid, as the brindled boar Grins fell destruction, to the monster's heart Let the dart lighten from the nervous arm. These Britain knows not; give, ye Britons, then Your sportive fury, pitiless, to pour Loose on the nightly robber of the fold; Him, from his craggy winding haunts unearth'd, Let all the thunder of the chase pursue. Throw the broad ditch behind you; o'er the hedge High bound, resistless; nor the deep morass Refuse, but through the shaking wilderness Pick your nice way; into the perilous flood Bear fearless, of the raging instinct full; And as you ride the torrent, to the banks Your triumph sound sonorous, running round, From rock to rock, in circling echoes tost; Then scale the mountains to their woody tops; Rush down the dangerous steep; and o'er the lawn, In fancy swallowing up the space between, Pour all your speed into the rapid game. For happy he! who tops the wheeling chase; Has every maze evolved, and every guile Disclosed; who knows the merits of the pack; Who saw the villain seized, and dying hard, Without complaint, though by a hundred mouths Relentless torn: O glorious he, beyond His daring peers! when the retreating horn Calls them to ghostly halls of gray renown, With woodland honours graced; the fox's fur, Depending decent from the roof: and spread Round the drear walls, with antic figures fierce, The stag's large front: he then is loudest heard, When the night staggers with severer toils, With feats Thessalian Centaurs never knew, And their repeated wonders shake the dome. But first the fuel'd chimney blazes wide; The tankards foam; and the strong table groans Beneath the smoking sirloin, stretch'd immense From side to side; in which, with desperate knife, They deep incision make, and talk the while Of England's glory, ne'er to be defaced While hence they borrow vigour: or amain Into the pasty plunged, at intervals, If stomach keen can intervals allow, Relating all the glories of the chase. Then sated Hunger bids his Brother Thirst Produce the mighty bowl; the mighty bowl, Swell'd high with fiery juice, steams liberal round A potent gale, delicious, as the breath Of Maia to the love-sick shepherdess, On violets diffused, while soft she hears Her panting shepherd stealing to her arms. Nor wanting is the brown October, drawn, Mature and perfect, from his dark retreat Of thirty years; and now his honest front Flames in the light refulgent, not afraid E'en with the vineyard's best produce to vie. To cheat the thirsty moments, Whist a while Walks his dull round beneath a cloud of smoke, Wreath'd, fragrant, from the pipe; or the quick dice, In thunder leaping from the box, awake The sounding gammon: while romp-loving miss Is haul'd about, in gallantry robust. At last these puling idlenesses laid Aside, frequent and full, the dry divan Close in firm circle; and set, ardent, in For serious drinking. Nor evasion sly, Nor sober shift, is to the puking wretch Indulged apart; but earnest, brimming bowls Lave every soul, the table floating round, And pavement, faithless to the fuddled foot. Thus as they swim in mutual swill, the talk, Vociferous at once from twenty tongues, Reels fast from theme to theme; from horses, hounds, To church or mistress, politics or ghost, In endless mazes, intricate, perplex'd. Meantime, with sudden interruption, loud, The impatient catch bursts from the joyous heart; That moment touch'd is every kindred soul; And, opening in a full-mouth'd cry of joy, The laugh, the slap, the jocund curse go round; While, from their slumbers shook, the kennel'd hounds Mix in the music of the day again. As when the tempest, that has vex'd the deep The dark night long, with fainter murmurs falls; So gradual sinks their mirth. Their feeble tongues, Unable to take up the cumbrous word, Lie quite dissolved. Before their maudlin eyes, Seen dim and blue, the double tapers dance, Like the sun wading through the misty sky. Then, sliding soft, they drop. Confused above, Glasses and bottles, pipes and gazetteers, As if the table e'en itself was drunk, Lie a wet broken scene; and wide, below, Is heap'd the social slaughter: where astride The lubber Power in filthy triumph sits, Slumbrous, inclining still from side to side, And steeps them drench'd in potent sleep till morn. Perhaps some doctor, of tremendous paunch, Awful and deep, a black abyss of drink, Outlives them all; and from his buried flock Retiring, full of rumination sad, Laments the weakness of these latter times. But if the rougher sex by this fierce sport Is hurried wild, let not such horrid joy E'er stain the bosom of the British Fair. Far be the spirit of the chase from them! Uncomely courage, unbeseeming skill; To spring the fence, to rein the prancing steed; The cap, the whip, the masculine attire; In which they roughen to the sense, and all The winning softness of their sex is lost. In them 'tis graceful to dissolve at woe; With every motion, every word, to wave Quick o'er the kindling cheek the ready blush; And from the smallest violence to shrink Unequal, then the loveliest in their fears; And by this silent adulation, soft, To their protection more engaging Man. O may their eyes no miserable sight, Save weeping lovers, see! a nobler game, Through love's enchanting wiles pursued, yet fled, In chase ambiguous. May their tender limbs Float in the loose simplicity of dress! And, fashion'd all to harmony, alone Know they to seize the captivated soul, In rapture warbled from love-breathing lips; To teach the lute to languish; with smooth step, Disclosing motion in its every charm, To swim along, and swell the mazy dance; To train the foliage o'er the snowy lawn; To guide the pencil, turn the tuneful page; To lend new flavour to the fruitful year, And heighten Nature's dainties: in their race To rear their graces into second life; To give society its highest taste; Well order'd home man's best delight to make; And by submissive wisdom, modest skill, With every gentle care-eluding art, To raise the virtues, animate the bliss, And sweeten all the toils of human life: This be the female dignity, and praise. Ye swains, now hasten to the hazel bank; Where, down yon dale, the wildly winding brook Falls hoarse from steep to steep. In close array, Fit for the thickets and the tangling shrub, Ye virgins, come. For you their latest song The woodlands raise; the clustering nuts for you The lover finds amid the secret shade; And, where they burnish on the topmost bough, With active vigour crushes down the tree; Or shakes them ripe from the resigning husk, A glossy shower, and of an ardent brown, As are the ringlets of Melinda's hair: Melinda! form'd with every grace complete; Yet these neglecting, above beauty wise, And far transcending such a vulgar praise. Hence from the busy joy-resounding fields, In cheerful error, let us tread the maze Of Autumn, unconfined; and taste, revived, The breath of orchard big with bending fruit, Obedient to the breeze and beating ray, From the deep-loaded bough a mellow shower Incessant melts away. The juicy pear Lies, in a soft profusion, scatter'd round. A various sweetness swells the gentle race; By Nature's all-refining hand prepared; Of temper'd sun, and water, earth, and air, In ever changing composition mix'd. Such, falling frequent through the chiller night, The fragrant stores, the wide projected heaps Of apples, which the lusty-handed Year, Innumerous, o'er the blushing orchard shakes. A various spirit, fresh, delicious, keen, Dwells in their gelid pores; and, active, points The piercing cyder for the thirsty tongue: Thy native theme, and boon inspirer too, Philips, Pomona's bard, the second thou Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfetter'd verse, With British freedom sing the British song: How, from Silurian vats, high sparkling wines Foam in transparent floods; some strong, to cheer The wintry revels of the labouring hind; And tasteful some, to cool the summer hours. In this glad season, while his sweetest beams The sun sheds equal o'er the meeken'd day; Oh lose me in the green delightful walks Of, Dodington, thy seat, serene and plain; Where simple Nature reigns; and every view, Diffusive, spreads the pure Dorsetian downs, In boundless prospect; yonder shagg'd with wood, Here rich with harvest, and there white with flocks! Meantime the grandeur of thy lofty dome, Far splendid, seizes on the ravish'd eye. New beauties rise with each revolving day; New columns swell; and still the fresh Spring finds New plants to quicken, and new groves to green. Full of thy genius all! the Muses' seat: Where in the secret bower, and winding walk, For virtuous Young and thee they twine the bay. Here wandering oft, fired with the restless thirst Of thy applause, I solitary court The inspiring breeze: and meditate the book Of Nature ever open; aiming thence, Warm from the heart, to learn the moral song. Here, as I steal along the sunny wall, Where Autumn basks, with fruit empurpled deep, My pleasing theme continual prompts my thought: Presents the downy peach; the shining plum: The ruddy, fragrant nectarine; and dark, Beneath his ample leaf, the luscious fig. The vine too here her curling tendrils shoots; Hangs out her clusters, glowing to the south; And scarcely wishes for a warmer sky. Turn we a moment Fancy's rapid flight To vigorous soils, and climes of fair extent; Where, by the potent sun elated high, The vineyard swells refulgent on the day; Spreads o'er the vale; or up the mountain climbs, Profuse; and drinks amid the sunny rocks, From cliff to cliff increased, the heighten'd blaze. Low bend the weighty boughs. The clusters clear, Half through the foliage seen, or ardent flame, Or shine transparent; while perfection breathes White o'er the turgent film the living dew. As thus they brighten with exalted juice, Touch'd into flavour by the mingling ray; The rural youth and virgins o'er the field, Each fond for each to cull the autumnal prime, Exulting rove, and speak the vintage nigh. Then comes the crushing swain; the country floats, And foams unbounded with the mashy flood; That by degrees fermented, and refined, Round the raised nations pours the cup of joy: The claret smooth, red as the lip we press In sparkling fancy, while we drain the bowl; The mellow-tasted burgundy; and quick, As is the wit it gives, the gay champagne. Now, by the cool declining year condensed, Descend the copious exhalations, check'd As up the middle sky unseen they stole, And roll the doubling fogs around the hill. No more the mountain, horrid, vast, sublime, Who pours a sweep of rivers from his sides, And high between contending kingdoms rears The rocky long division, fills the view With great variety; but in a night Of gathering vapour, from the baffled sense Sinks dark and dreary. Thence expanding far, The huge dusk, gradual, swallows up the plain: Vanish the woods: the dim-seen river seems Sullen, and slow, to roll the misty wave. E'en in the height of noon oppress'd, the sun Sheds weak, and blunt, his wide-refracted ray; Whence glaring oft, with many a broaden'd orb, He frights the nations. Indistinct on earth, Seen through the turbid air, beyond the life Objects appear; and, wilder'd, o'er the waste The shepherd stalks gigantic. Till at last Wreath'd dun around, in deeper circles still Successive closing, sits the general fog Unbounded o'er the world; and, mingling thick, A formless grey confusion covers all. As when of old (so sung the Hebrew Bard) Light, uncollected, through the chaos urged Its infant way; nor Order yet had drawn His lovely train from out the dubious gloom. These roving mists, that constant now begin To smoke along the hilly country, these, With weightier rains, and melted Alpine snows, The mountain-cisterns fill, those ample stores Of water, scoop'd among the hollow rocks; Whence gush the streams, the ceaseless fountains play, And their unfailing wealth the rivers draw. Some sages say, that, where the numerous wave For ever lashes the resounding shore, Drill'd through the sandy stratum, every way, The waters with the sandy stratum rise; Amid whose angles infinitely strain'd, They joyful leave their jaggy salts behind, And clear and sweeten as they soak along. Nor stops the restless fluid, mounting still, Though oft amidst the irriguous vale it springs; But to the mountain courted by the sand, That leads it darkling on in faithful maze, Far from the parent-main, it boils again Fresh into day; and all the glittering hill Is bright with spouting rills. But hence this vain Amusive dream! why should the waters love To take so far a journey to the hills, When the sweet valleys offer to their toil Inviting quiet, and a nearer bed? Or if by blind ambition led astray, They must aspire; why should they sudden stop Among the broken mountain's rushy dells, And, ere they gain its highest peak, desert The attractive sand that charm'd their course so long? Besides, the hard agglomerating salts, The spoil of ages, would impervious choke Their secret channels; or, by slow degrees, High as the hills protrude the swelling vales: Old Ocean too, suck'd through the porous globe, Had long ere now forsook his horrid bed, And brought Deucalion's watery times again. Say then, where lurk the vast eternal springs, That, like creating Nature, lie conceal'd From mortal eye, yet with their lavish stores Refresh the globe, and all its joyous tribes! O thou pervading Genius, given to man, To trace the secrets of the dark abyss, O lay the mountains bare! and wide display Their hidden structure to the astonish'd view! Strip from the branching Alps their piny load; The huge incumbrance of horrific woods From Asian Taurus, from Imaus stretch'd Athwart the roving Tartar's sullen bounds; Give opening Hemus to my searching eye, And high Olympus pouring many a stream! O from the sounding summits of the north, The Dofrine hills, through Scandinavia roll'd To farthest Lapland and the frozen main; From lofty Caucasus, far seen by those Who in the Caspian and black Euxine toil; From cold Riphean rocks, which the wild Russ Believes the stony girdle The Moscovites call the Riphean Mountains Weliki Camenypoys, that is, the great stony Girdle: because they suppose them to encompass the whole earth. of the world: And all the dreadful mountains, wrapp'd in storm, Whence wide Siberia draws her lonely floods; O sweep the eternal snows! hung o'er the deep, That ever works beneath his sounding base, Bid Atlas, propping heaven, as poets feign, His subterranean wonders spread! unveil The miny caverns, blazing on the day, Of Abyssinia's cloud-compelling cliffs, And of the bending Mountains A range of mountains in Africa, that surround all Monomotapa. of the Moon! O'ertopping all these giant sons of earth, Let the dire Andes, from the radiant line Stretch'd to the stormy seas that thunder round The southern pole, their hideous deeps unfold! Amazing scene! Behold! the glooms disclose; I see the rivers in their infant beds! Deep, deep I hear them, labouring to get free; I see the leaning strata, artful ranged; The gaping fissures to receive the rains, The melting snows, and ever dripping fogs. Strow'd bibulous above I see the sands, The pebbly gravel next, the layers then Of mingled moulds, of more retentive earths The gutter'd rocks and mazy-running clefts; That, while the stealing moisture they transmit, Retard its motion, and forbid its waste. Beneath the incessant weeping of these drains, I see the rocky siphons stretch'd immense, The mighty reservoirs, of harden'd chalk, Or stiff compacted clay, capacious form'd: O'erflowing thence, the congregated stores, The crystal treasures of the liquid world, Through the stirr'd sands a bubbling passage burst; And welling out, around the middle steep, Or from the bottoms of the bosom'd hills, In pure effusion flow. United, thus, The exhaling sun, the vapour-burden'd air, The gelid mountains, that to rain condensed These vapours in continual current draw, And send them, o'er the fair-divided earth, In bounteous rivers to the deep again, A social commerce hold, and firm support The full-adjusted harmony of things. When Autumn scatters his departing gleams, Warn'd of approaching Winter, gather'd, play The swallow-people; and toss'd wide around, O'er the calm sky, in convolution swift, The feather'd eddy floats: rejoicing once, Ere to their wintry slumbers they retire; In clusters clung, beneath the mouldering bank, And where, unpierced by frost, the cavern sweats. Or rather into warmer climes convey'd, With other kindred birds of season, there They twitter cheerful, till the vernal months Invite them welcome back: for, thronging, now Innumerous wings are in commotion all. Where the Rhine loses his majestic force In Belgian plains, won from the raging deep, By diligence amazing, and the strong Unconquerable hand of Liberty, The stork-assembly meets; for many a day, Consulting deep, and various, ere they take Their arduous voyage through the liquid sky: And now their route design'd, their leaders chose, Their tribes adjusted, clean'd their vigorous wings; And many a circle, many a short essay, Wheel'd round and round, in congregation full The figured flight ascends; and, riding high The aÃ«rial billows, mixes with the clouds. Or where the Northern ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked melancholy isles Of farthest Thule, and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides; Who can recount what transmigrations there Are annual made? what nations come and go? And how the living clouds on clouds arise? Infinite wings! till all the plume-dark air, And rude resounding shore are one wild cry. Here the plain harmless native his small flock, And herd diminutive of many hues, Tends on the little island's verdant swell, The shepherd's sea-girt reign; or, to the rocks Dire-clinging, gathers his ovarious food; Or sweeps the fishy shore! or treasures up The plumage, rising full, to form the bed Of luxury. And here a while the Muse, High hovering o'er the broad cerulean scene, Sees Caledonia, in romantic view: Her airy mountains, from the waving main, Invested with a keen diffusive sky, Breathing the soul acute; her forests huge, Incult, robust, and tall, by Nature's hand Planted of old; her azure lakes between, Pour'd out extensive, and of watery wealth Full; winding deep, and green, her fertile vales; With many a cool translucent brimming flood Wash'd lovely, from the Tweed (pure parent stream, Whose pastoral banks first heard my Doric reed, With, silvan Jed, thy tributary brook) To where the north-inflated tempest foams O'er Orca's or Betubium's highest peak: Nurse of a people, in Misfortune's school Train'd up to hardy deeds; soon visited By Learning, when before the gothic rage She took her western flight. A manly race, Of unsubmitting spirit, wise, and brave; Who still through bleeding ages struggled hard, (As well unhappy Wallace can attest, Great patriot-hero! ill requited chief!) To hold a generous undiminish'd state; Too much in vain! Hence of unequal bounds Impatient, and by tempting glory borne O'er every land, for every land their life Has flow'd profuse, their piercing genius plann'd, And swell'd the pomp of peace their faithful toil. As from their own clear north, in radiant streams, Bright over Europe bursts the boreal morn. Oh! is there not some patriot, in whose power That best, that godlike luxury is placed, Of blessing thousands, thousands yet unborn, Through late posterity? some, large of soul, To cheer dejected industry? to give A double harvest to the pining swain? And teach the labouring hand the sweets of toil? How, by the finest art, the native robe To weave; how white as hyperborean snow, To form the lucid lawn; with venturous oar How to dash wide the billow; nor look on, Shamefully passive while Batavian fleets Defraud us of the glittering finny swarms, That heave our friths, and crowd upon our shores; How all-enlivening trade to rouse, and wing The prosperous sail, from every growing port, Uninjured, round the sea-encircled globe; And thus, in soul united as in name, Bid Britain reign the mistress of the deep? Yes, there are such. And full on thee, Argyle, Her hope, her stay, her darling, and her boast, From her first patriots and her heroes sprung, Thy fond imploring country turns her eye; In thee with all a mother's triumph, sees Her every virtue, every grace combined, Her genius, wisdom, her engaging turn, Her pride of honour, and her courage tried, Calm, and intrepid, in the very throat Of sulphurous war, on Tenier's dreadful field. Nor less the palm of peace inwreathes thy brow: For, powerful as thy sword, from thy rich tongue Persuasion flows, and wins the high debate; While mix'd in thee combine the charm of youth, The force of manhood, and the depth of age. Thee, Forbes, too, whom every worth attends, As truth sincere, as weeping friendship kind, Thee, truly generous, and in silence great, Thy country feels through her reviving arts, Plann'd by thy wisdom, by thy soul inform'd; And seldom has she known a friend like thee. But see the fading many-colour'd woods, Shade deepening over shade, the country round Imbrown; a crowded umbrage, dusk, and dun, Of every hue, from wan declining green To sooty dark. These now the lonesome Muse, Low whispering, lead into their leaf-strown walks, And give the Season in its latest view. Meantime, light shadowing all, a sober calm Fleeces unbounded ether: whose least wave Stands tremulous, uncertain where to turn The gentle current: while illumined wide, The dewy-skirted clouds imbibe the sun, And through their lucid veil his soften'd force Shed o'er the peaceful world. Then is the time, For those whom Wisdom and whom Nature charm, To steal themselves from the degenerate crowd, And soar above this little scene of things: To tread low-thoughted Vice beneath their feet; To soothe the throbbing passions into peace; And woo lone Quiet in her silent walks. Thus solitary, and in pensive guise, Oft let me wander o'er the russet mead, And through the sadden'd grove, where scarce is heard One dying strain, to cheer the woodman's toil. Haply some widow'd songster pours his plaint, Far, in faint warblings, through the tawny copse: While congregated thrushes, linnets, larks, And each wild throat, whose artless strains so late Swell'd all the music of the swarming shades, Robb'd of their tuneful souls, now shivering sit On the dead tree, a dull despondent flock; With not a brightness waving o'er their plumes, And nought save chattering discord in their note. O let not, aim'd from some inhuman eye, The gun the music of the coming year Destroy; and harmless, unsuspecting harm, Lay the weak tribes a miserable prey, In mingled murder, fluttering on the ground! The pale-descending year, yet pleasing still, A gentler mood inspires; for now the leaf Incessant rustles from the mournful grove; Oft startling such as, studious, walk below, And slowly circles through the waving air. But should a quicker breeze amid the boughs Sob, o'er the sky the leafy deluge streams; Till choked, and matted with the dreary shower, The forest walks, at every rising gale, Roll wide the wither'd waste, and whistle bleak. Fled is the blasted verdure of the fields; And, shrunk into their beds, the flowery race Their sunny robes resign. E'en what remain'd Of stronger fruits falls from the naked tree; And woods, fields, gardens, orchards, all around The desolated prospect thrills the soul. He comes! he comes! in every breeze the Power Of Philosophic Melancholy comes! His near approach the sudden starting tear, The glowing cheek, the mild dejected air, The soften'd feature, and the beating heart, Pierced deep with many a virtuous pang, declare. O'er all the soul his sacred influence breathes! Inflames imagination; through the breast Infuses every tenderness; and far Beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought. Ten thousand thousand fleet ideas, such As never mingled with the vulgar dream, Crowd fast into the mind's creative eye. As fast the correspondent passions rise, As varied, and as high: Devotion raised To rapture, and divine astonishment; The love of Nature unconfined, and, chief, Of human race; the large ambitious wish, To make them blest; the sigh for suffering worth Lost in obscurity; the noble scorn Of tyrant pride; the fearless great resolve; The wonder which the dying patriot draws, Inspiring glory through remotest time; The awaken'd throb for virtue, and for fame; The sympathies of love, and friendship dear; With all the social offspring of the heart. Oh! bear me then to vast embowering shades, To twilight groves, and visionary vales; To weeping grottos, and prophetic glooms; Where angel forms athwart the solemn dusk, Tremendous sweep, or seem to sweep along; And voices more than human, through the void Deep sounding, seize the enthusiastic ear? Or is this gloom too much? Then lead, ye powers, That o'er the garden and the rural seat Preside, which shining through the cheerful hand In countless numbers blest Britannia sees; O lead me to the wide extended walks, The fair majestic paradise of Stowe! The seat of Lord Cobham. Not Persian Cyrus on Ionia's shore E'er saw such sylvan scenes; such various art By genius fired, such ardent genius tamed By cool judicious art; that, in the strife, All beauteous Nature fears to be outdone. And there, O Pitt, thy country's early boast, There let me sit beneath the shelter'd slopes, Or in that Temple The Temple of Virtue in Stowe Gardens. where, in future times, Thou well shalt merit a distinguish'd name; And, with thy converse blest, catch the last smiles Of Autumn beaming o'er the yellow woods. While there with thee the enchanted round I walk, The regulated wild, gay Fancy then Will tread in thought the groves of attic land; Will from thy standard taste refine her own, Correct her pencil to the purest truth Of Nature, or, the unimpassion'd shades Forsaking, raise it to the human mind. Or if hereafter she, with juster hand, Shall draw the tragic scene, instruct her, thou, To mark the varied movements of the heart, What every decent character requires, And every passion speaks: O through her strain Breathe thy pathetic eloquence! that moulds The attentive senate, charms, persuades, exalts, Of honest Zeal the indignant lightning throws, And shakes Corruption on her venal throne. While thus we talk, and through Elysian vales Delighted rove, perhaps a sigh escapes: What pity, Cobham, thou thy verdant files Of order'd trees shouldst here inglorious range, Instead of squadrons flaming o'er the field, And long embattled hosts! when the proud foe, The faithless vain disturber of mankind, Insulting Gaul, has roused the world to war; When keen, once more, within their bounds to press Those polish'd robbers, those ambitious slaves, The British youth would hail thy wise command, Thy temper'd ardour and thy veteran skill. The western sun withdraws the shorten'd day; And humid Evening, gliding o'er the sky, In her chill progress, to the ground condensed The vapours throws. Where creeping waters ooze, Where marshes stagnate, and where rivers wind, Cluster the rolling fogs, and swim along The dusky-mantled lawn. Meanwhile the Moon Full-orb'd, and breaking through the scatter'd clouds, Shows her broad visage in the crimson'd east. Turn'd to the sun direct, her spotted disk, Where mountains rise, umbrageous dales descend, And caverns deep, as optic tube descries, A smaller earth, gives us his blaze again, Void of its flame, and sheds a softer day. Now through the passing cloud she seems to stoop, Now up the pure cerulean rides sublime. Wide the pale deluge floats, and streaming mild O'er the sky'd mountain to the shadowy vale, While rocks and floods reflect the quivering gleam, The whole air whitens with a boundless tide Of silver radiance, trembling round the world. But when half blotted from the sky her light, Fainting, permits the starry fires to burn With keener lustre through the depth of heaven; Or near extinct her deaden'd orb appears, And scarce appears, of sickly beamless white; Oft in this season, silent from the north A blaze of meteors shoots; ensweeping first The lower skies, they all at once converge High to the crown of heaven, and all at once Relapsing quick, as quickly reascend, And mix, and thwart, extinguish, and renew, All ether coursing in a maze of light. From look to look, contagious through the crowd, The panic runs, and into wondrous shapes The appearance throws: armies in meet array, Throng'd with aÃ«rial spears, and steeds of fire; Till the long lines of full extended war In bleeding fight commix'd, the sanguine flood Rolls a broad slaughter o'er the plains of heaven. As thus they scan the visionary scene, On all sides swells the superstitious din, Incontinent; and busy frenzy talks Of blood and battle; cities overturn'd, And late at night in swallowing earthquake sunk, Or hideous wrapt in fierce ascending flame; Of sallow famine, inundation, storm; Of pestilence, and every great distress; Empires subversed, when ruling fate has struck The unalterable hour: e'en Nature's self Is deem'd to totter on the brink of time. Not so the man of philosophic eye, And inspect sage; the waving brightness he Curious surveys, inquisitive to know The causes, and materials, yet unfix'd, Of this appearance beautiful and new. Now black, and deep, the night begins to fall, A shade immense! Sunk in the quenching gloom, Magnificent and vast, are heaven and earth. Order confounded lies; all beauty void; Distinction lost; and gay variety One universal blot: such the fair power Of light, to kindle and create the whole. Drear is the state of the benighted wretch, Who then, bewilder'd, wanders through the dark, Full of pale fancies, and chimeras huge; Nor visited by one directive ray, From cottage streaming, or from airy hall. Perhaps impatient as he stumbles on, Struck from the root of slimy rushes, blue, The wildfire scatters round, or gather'd trails A length of flame deceitful o'er the moss: Whither decoy'd by the fantastic blaze, Now lost and now renew'd he sinks absorb'd, Rider and horse, amid the miry gulf: While still, from day to day, his pining wife And plaintive children his return await, In wild conjecture lost. At other times, Sent by the better Genius of the night, Innoxious, gleaming on the horse's mane, The meteor sits; and shows the narrow path, That winding leads through pits of death, or else Instructs him how to take the dangerous ford. The lengthen'd night elapsed, the Morning shines Serene, in all her dewy beauty bright, Unfolding fair the last autumnal day. And now the mounting sun dispels the fog; The rigid hoar frost melts before his beam; And hung on every spray, on every blade Of grass, the myriad dew-drops twinkle round. Ah, see where, robb'd and murder'd, in that pit Lies the still heaving hive! at evening snatch'd, Beneath the cloud of guilt-concealing night, And fix'd o'er sulphur: while, not dreaming ill, The happy people, in their waxen cells, Sat tending public cares, and planning schemes Of temperance, for Winter poor; rejoiced To mark, full flowing round, their copious stores. Sudden the dark oppressive steam ascends; And, used to milder scents, the tender race, By thousands, tumble from their honey'd domes, Convolved, and agonizing in the dust. And was it then for this you roam'd the Spring, Intent from flower to flower? for this you toil'd Ceaseless the burning Summer heats away? For this in Autumn search'd the blooming waste, Nor lost one sunny gleam? for this sad fate? O Man! tyrannic lord! how long, how long Shall prostrate Nature groan beneath your rage, Awaiting renovation? when obliged, Must you destroy? of their ambrosial food Can you not borrow; and, in just return, Afford them shelter from the wintry winds; Or, as the sharp year pinches, with their own Again regale them on some smiling day? See where the stony bottom of their town Looks desolate, and wild; with here and there A helpless number, who the ruin'd state Survive, lamenting weak, cast out to death. Thus a proud city, populous and rich, Full of the works of peace, and high in joy, At theatre or feast, or sunk in sleep, (As late, Palermo, was thy fate) is seized By some dread earthquake, and convulsive hurl'd Sheer from the black foundation, stench-involved, Into a gulf of blue sulphureous flame. Hence every harsher sight! for now the day, O'er heaven and earth diffused, grows warm, and high; Infinite splendour! wide investing all. How still the breeze! save what the filmy thread Of dew evaporate brushes from the plain. How clear the cloudless sky? how deeply tinged With a peculiar blue! the ethereal arch How swell'd immense! amid whose azure throned The radiant sun how gay! how calm below The gilded earth! the harvest-treasures all Now gather'd in, beyond the rage of storms, Sure to the swain; the circling fence shut up; And instant Winter's utmost rage defied. While, loose to festive joy, the country round Laughs with the loud sincerity of mirth, Shook to the wind their cares. The toil-strung youth By the quick sense of music taught alone, Leaps wildly graceful in the lively dance. Her every charm abroad, the village-toast, Young, buxom, warm, in native beauty rich, Darts not unmeaning looks; and, where her eye Points an approving smile, with double force, The cudgel rattles, and the wrestler twines. Age too shines out; and, garrulous, recounts The feats of youth. Thus they rejoice; nor think That, with to-morrow's sun, their annual toil Begins again the never ceasing round. Oh, knew he but his happiness, of men The happiest he! who far from public rage, Deep in the vale, with a choice few retired, Drinks the pure pleasures of the Rural Life. What though the dome be wanting, whose proud gate, Each morning, vomits out the sneaking crowd Of flatterers false, and in their turn abused? Vile intercourse! what though the glittering robe Of every hue reflected light can give, Or floating loose, or stiff with mazy gold, The pride and gaze of fools! oppress him not? What though, from utmost land and sea purvey'd, For him each rarer tributary life Bleeds not, and his insatiate table heaps With luxury, and death? What though his bowl Flames not with costly juice; nor sunk in beds, Oft of gay care, he tosses out the night, Or melts the thoughtless hours in idle state? What though he knows not those fantastic joys That still amuse the wanton, still deceive; A face of pleasure, but a heart of pain; Their hollow moments undelighted all? Sure peace is his; a solid life, estranged To disappointment, and fallacious hope: Rich in content, in Nature's bounty rich, In herbs and fruits; whatever greens the Spring, When heaven descends in showers; or bends the bough, When Summer reddens, and when Autumn beams; Or in the wintry glebe whatever lies Conceal'd, and fattens with the richest sap: These are not wanting; nor the milky drove, Luxuriant, spread o'er all the lowing vale; Nor bleating mountains; nor the chide of streams, And hum of bees, inviting sleep sincere Into the guiltless breast, beneath the shade, Or thrown at large amid the fragrant hay; Nor aught besides of prospect, grove, or song, Dim grottos, gleaming lakes, and fountain clear. Here too dwells simple Truth; plain Innocence; Unsullied Beauty; sound unbroken Youth, Patient of labour, with a little pleased; Health ever blooming; unambitious Toil; Calm Contemplation, and poetic Ease. Let others brave the flood in quest of gain, And beat, for joyless months, the gloomy wave. Let such as deem it glory to destroy Rush into blood, the sack of cities seek; Unpierced, exulting in the widow's wail, The virgin's shriek, and infant's trembling cry. Let some, far distant from their native soil, Urged or by want or harden'd avarice, Find other lands beneath another sun. Let this through cities work his eager way, By legal outrage and establish'd guile, The social sense extinct; and that ferment Mad into tumult the seditious herd, Or melt them down to slavery. Let these Insnare the wretched in the toils of law, Fomenting discord, and perplexing right, An iron race! and those of fairer front, But equal inhumanity, in courts, Delusive pomp and dark cabals, delight; Wreathe the deep bow, diffuse the lying smile, And tread the weary labyrinth of state. While he, from all the stormy passions free That restless men involve, hears, and but hears, At distance safe, the human tempest roar, Wrapp'd close in conscious peace. The fall of kings, The rage of nations, and the crush of states, Move not the man, who, from the world escaped, In still retreats and flowery solitudes, To Nature's voice attends, from month to month, And day to day, through the revolving year; Admiring, sees her in her every shape; Feels all her sweet emotions at his heart; Takes what she liberal gives, nor thinks of more. He, when young Spring protrudes the bursting germs, Marks the first bud, and sucks the healthful gale Into his freshen'd soul; her genial hours He full enjoys; and not a beauty blows, And not an opening blossom breathes in vain. In Summer he, beneath the living shade, Such as o'er frigid TempÃ¨ wont to wave, Or Hemus cool, reads what the Muse, of these, Perhaps, has in immortal numbers sung; Or what she dictates writes: and, oft an eye Shot round, rejoices in the vigorous year. When Autumn's yellow lustre gilds the world, And tempts the sickled swain into the field, Seized by the general joy, his heart distends With gentle throes; and, through the tepid gleams Deep musing, then he best exerts his song. E'en Winter wild to him is full of bliss. The mighty tempest, and the hoary waste, Abrupt and deep, stretch'd o'er the buried earth, Awake to solemn thought. At night the skies, Disclosed, and kindled, by refining frost, Pour every lustre on the exalted eye. A friend, a book, the stealing hours secure, And mark them down for wisdom. With swift wing O'er land and sea imagination roams; Or truth, divinely breaking on his mind, Elates his being, and unfolds his powers; Or in his breast heroic virtue burns. The touch of kindred too and love he feels; The modest eye, whose beams on his alone Ecstatic shine; the little strong embrace Of prattling children, twined around his neck, And emulous to please him, calling forth The fond parental soul. Nor purpose gay, Amusement, dance, or song, he sternly scorns; For happiness and true philosophy Are of the social, still, and smiling kind. This is the life which those who fret in guilt, And guilty cities, never knew; the life, Led by primeval ages, uncorrupt, When Angels dwelt, and God himself, with Man! Oh Nature! all-sufficient! over all! Enrich me with the knowledge of thy works! Snatch me to Heaven; thy rolling wonders there, World beyond world, in infinite extent, Profusely scatter'd o'er the blue immense, Show me; their motions, periods, and their laws Give me to scan; through the disclosing deep Light my blind way: the mineral strata there; Thrust, blooming, thence the vegetable world; O'er that the rising system, more complex, Of animals; and higher still, the mind, The varied scene of quick-compounded thought, And where the mixing passions endless shift; These ever open to my ravish'd eye; A search, the flight of time can ne'er exhaust! But if to that unequal; if the blood, In sluggish streams about my heart, forbid That best ambition; under closing shades, Inglorious, lay me by the lowly brook, And whisper to my dreams. From Thee begin, Dwell all on Thee, with Thee conclude my song; And let me never, never stray from Thee! WINTER. ?Horrida cano Bruma gelu.? TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR SPENCER COMPTON. ARGUMENT. The subject proposed. Address to the Earl of Wilmington. First approach of Winter. According to the natural course of the Season, various Storms described. Rain. Wind. Snow. The driving of the Snows: a Man perishing among them; whence reflections on the Wants and Miseries of Human Life. The Wolves descending from the Alps and Appeniues. A Winter Evening described; as spent by Philosophers; by the Country People; in the City. Frost. A view of Winter within the Polar Circle. A Thaw. The whole concluding with moral reflections on a Future State. See, Winter comes, to rule the varied year, Sullen and sad, with all his rising train; Vapours, and clouds, and storms. Be these my theme, These! that exalt the soul to solemn thought, And heavenly musing. Welcome, kindred glooms, Congenial horrors, hail! with frequent foot, Pleased have I, in my cheerful morn of life, When nursed by careless Solitude I lived, And sung of Nature with unceasing joy, Pleased have I wander'd through your rough domain; Trod the pure virgin-snows, myself as pure; Heard the winds roar, and the big torrent burst; Or seen the deep-fermenting tempest brew'd, In the grim evening sky. Thus pass'd the time, Till through the lucid chambers of the south Look'd out the joyous Spring, look'd out, and smiled. To thee, the patron of her first essay, The Muse, O Wilmington! renews her song. Since has she rounded the revolving year: Skimm'd the gay Spring; on eagle-pinions borne, Attempted through the Summer-blaze to rise; Then swept o'er Autumn with the shadowy gale; And now among the wintry clouds again, Roll'd in the doubling storm, she tries to soar; To swell her note with all the rushing winds; To suit her sounding cadence to the floods; As is her theme, her numbers wildly great: Thrice happy could she fill thy judging ear With bold description, and with manly thought. Nor art thou skill'd in awful schemes alone, And how to make a mighty people thrive; But equal goodness, sound integrity, A firm, unshaken, uncorrupted soul, Amid a sliding age, and burning strong, Not vainly blazing for thy country's weal, A steady spirit regularly free; These, each exalting each, the statesman light Into the patriot; these, the public hope And eye to thee converting, bid the Muse Record what envy dares not flattery call. Now when the cheerless empire of the sky To Capricorn the Centaur Archer yields, And fierce Aquarius stains the inverted year; Hung o'er the farthest verge of Heaven, the sun Scarce spreads through ether the dejected day. Faint are his gleams, and ineffectual shoot His struggling rays, in horizontal lines, Through the thick air; as clothed in cloudy storm, Weak, wan, and broad, he skirts the southern sky; And, soon-descending, to the long dark night, Wide-shading all, the prostrate world resigns. Nor is the night unwish'd; while vital heat, Light, life, and joy, the dubious day forsake. Meantime, in sable cincture, shadows vast, Deep-tinged and damp, and congregated clouds, And all the vapoury turbulence of Heaven, Involve the face of things. Thus Winter falls, A heavy gloom oppressive o'er the world, Through Nature shedding influence malign, And rouses up the seeds of dark disease, The soul of man dies in him, loathing life, And black with more than melancholy views. The cattle droop; and o'er the furrow'd land, Fresh from the plough, the dun discolour'd flocks, Untended spreading, crop the wholesome root. Along the woods, along the moorish fens, Sighs the sad Genius of the coming storm; And up among the loose disjointed cliffs, And fractured mountains wild, the brawling brook And cave, presageful, send a hollow moan, Resounding long in listening Fancy's ear. Then comes the father of the tempest forth, Wrapt in black glooms. First joyless rains obscure. Drive through the mingling skies with vapour foul; Dash on the mountain's brow, and shake the woods, That grumbling wave below. The unsightly plain Lies a brown deluge; as the low-bent clouds Pour flood on flood, yet unexhausted still Combine, and deepening into night, shut up The day's fair face. The wanderers of Heaven, Each to his home, retire; save those that love To take their pastime in the troubled air, Or skimming flutter round the dimply pool. The cattle from the untasted fields return, And ask, with meaning low, their wonted stalls, Or ruminate in the contiguous shade. Thither the household feathery people crowd, The crested cock, with all his female train, Pensive, and dripping; while the cottage-hind Hangs oe'r the enlivening blaze, and taleful there Recounts his simple frolic: much he talks, And much he laughs, nor recks the storm that blows Without, and rattles on his humble roof. Wide o'er the brim, with many a torrent swell'd, And the mix'd ruin of its banks o'erspread, At last the roused-up river pours along: Resistless, roaring, dreadful, down it comes, From the rude mountain, and the mossy wild, Tumbling through rocks abrupt, and sounding far; Then o'er the sanded valley floating spreads, Calm, sluggish, silent; till again, constrain'd Between two meeting hills, it bursts away, Where rocks and woods o'erhang the turbid stream; There gathering triple force, rapid, and deep, It boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders through. Nature! great parent! whose unceasing hand Rolls round the seasons of the changeful year, How mighty, how majestic, are thy works! With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul! That sees astonish'd! and astonish'd sings! Ye too, ye winds! that now begin to blow With boisterous sweep, I raise my voice to you. Where are your stores, ye powerful beings! say, Where your aÃ«rial magazines reserved, To swell the brooding terrors of the storm? In what far distant region of the sky, Hush'd in deep silence, sleep ye when 'tis calm? When from the pallid sky the sun descends, With many a spot, that o'er his glaring orb Uncertain wanders, stain'd; red fiery streaks Begin to flush around. The reeling clouds Stagger with dizzy poise, as doubting yet Which master to obey: while rising slow, Blank, in the leaden-colour'd east, the moon Wears a wan circle round her blunted horns. Seen through the turbid fluctuating air, The stars obtuse emit a shiver'd ray; Or frequent seem to shoot athwart the gloom, And long behind them trail the whitening blaze. Snatch'd in short eddies, plays the wither'd leaf; And on the flood the dancing feather floats. With broaden'd nostrils to the sky upturn'd, The conscious heifer snuffs the stormy gale. E'en as the matron, at her nightly task, With pensive labour draws the flaxen thread, The wasted taper and the crackling flame Foretell the blast. But chief the plumy race, The tenants of the sky, its changes speak. Retiring from the downs, where all day long They pick'd their scanty fare, a blackening train, Of clamorous rooks thick urge their weary flight And seek the closing shelter of the grove; Assiduous, in his bower, the wailing owl Plies his sad song. The cormorant on high Wheels from the deep, and screams along the land. Loud shrieks the soaring hern; and with wild wing The circling seafowl cleave the flaky clouds. Ocean, unequal press'd, with broken tide And blind commotion heaves; while from the shore, Eat into caverns by the restless wave, And forest-rustling mountain, comes a voice, That solemn sounding bids the world prepare. Then issues forth the storm with sudden burst, And hurls the whole precipitated air Down in a torrent. On the passive main Descends the ethereal force, and with strong gust Turns from its bottom the discolour'd deep. Through the black night that sits immense around, Lash'd into foam, the fierce conflicting brine Seems o'er a thousand raging waves to burn: Meantime the mountain-billows, to the clouds In dreadful tumult swell'd, surge above surge, Burst into chaos with tremendous roar, And anchor'd navies from their stations drive, Wild as the winds across the howling waste Of mighty waters: now the inflated wave Straining they scale, and now impetuous shoot Into the secret chambers of the deep, The wintry Baltic thundering o'er their head. Emerging thence again, before the breath Of full exerted Heaven they wing their course, And dart on distant coasts; if some sharp rock, Or shoal insidious break not their career, And in loose fragments fling them floating round. Nor less at hand the loosen'd tempest reigns. The mountain thunders; and its sturdy sons Stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade. Lone on the midnight steep, and all aghast, The dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils, And, often falling, climbs against the blast. Low waves the rooted forest, vex'd, and sheds What of its tarnish'd honours yet remain; Dash'd down, and scatter'd, by the tearing wind's Assiduous fury, its gigantic limbs. Thus struggling through the dissipated grove, The whirling tempest raves along the plain; And on the cottage thatch'd, or lordly roof, Keen-fastening, shakes them to the solid base. Sleep frighted flies; and round the rocking dome, For entrance eager, howls the savage blast. Then too, they say, through all the burden'd air, Long groans are heard, shrill sounds, and distant sighs, That, utter'd by the Demon of the night, Warn the devoted wretch of woe and death. Huge uproar lords it wide. The clouds commix'd With stars swift gliding sweep along the sky. All Nature reels. Till Nature's King, who oft Amid tempestuous darkness dwells alone, And on the wings of the careering wind Walks dreadfully serene, commands a calm; Then straight, air, sea, and earth are hush'd at once. As yet 'tis midnight deep. The weary clouds, Slow meeting, mingle into solid gloom. Now, while the drowsy world lies lost in sleep, Let me associate with the serious Night, And Contemplation her sedate compeer; Let me shake off the intrusive cares of day, And lay the meddling senses all aside. Where now, ye lying vanities of life! Ye ever tempting ever cheating train! Where are you now? and what is your amount? Vexation, disappointment, and remorse: Sad, sickening thought! and yet deluded man, A scene of crude disjointed visions past, And broken slumbers, rises still resolved, With new-flush'd hopes, to run the giddy round. Father of light and life! thou Good Supreme! O teach me what is good! teach me Thyself! Save me from folly, vanity, and vice, From every low pursuit! and feed my soul With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure; Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss! The keener tempests rise: and fuming dun From all the livid east, or piercing north, Thick clouds ascend; in whose capacious womb A vapoury deluge lies, to snow congeal'd. Heavy they roll their fleecy world along; And the sky saddens with the gather'd storm Through the hush'd air the whitening shower descends, At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes Fall broad, and wide, and fast, dimming the day, With a continual flow. The cherish'd fields Put on their winter-robe of purest white. 'Tis brightness all; save where the new snow melts Along the mazy current. Low the woods Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun Faint from the west emits his evening ray, Earth's universal face, deep hid, and chill, Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide The works of man. Drooping, the labourer-ox Stands cover'd o'er with snow, and then demands The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of Heaven, Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around The winnowing store, and claim the little boon Which Providence assigns them. One alone, The redbreast, sacred to the household gods, Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky, In joyless fields and thorny thickets, leaves His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man His annual visit. Half afraid, he first Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights On the warm hearth; then, hopping o'er the floor, Eyes all the smiling family askance, And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is; Till more familiar grown, the table-crumbs Attract his slender feet. The foodless wilds Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare, Though timorous of heart, and hard beset By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs, And more unpitying men, the garden seeks, Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind Eye the bleak Heaven, and next the glistening earth, With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed, Dig for the wither'd herb through heaps of snow. Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind, Baffle the raging year, and fill their pens With food at will; lodge them below the storm, And watch them strict: for from the bellowing east, In this dire season, oft the whirlwind's wing Sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains At one wide waft, and o'er the hapless flocks, Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills, The billowy tempest whelms; till, upward urged, The valley to a shining mountain swells, Tipp'd with a wreath high-curling in the sky. As thus the snows arise; and foul, and fierce, All Winter drives along the darken'd air: In his own loose revolving fields, the swain Disaster'd stands; sees other hills ascend, Of unknown joyless brow; and other scenes, Of horrid prospect, shag the trackless plain: Nor finds the river, nor the forest, hid Beneath the formless wild; but wanders on From hill to dale, still more and more astray; Impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps, Stung with the thoughts of home; the thoughts of home Rush on his nerves, and call their vigour forth In many a vain attempt. How sinks his soul! What black despair, what horror fills his heart! When for the dusky spot, which fancy feign'd His tufted cottage rising through the snow, He meets the roughness of the middle waste, Far from the track and bless'd abode of man; While round him night resistless closes fast, And every tempest, howling o'er his head, Renders the savage wilderness more wild. Then throng the busy shapes into his mind, Of cover'd pits, unfathomably deep, A dire descent! beyond the power of frost; Of faithless bogs; of precipices huge, Smooth'd up with snow; and, what is land, unknown, What water, of the still unfrozen spring, In the loose marsh or solitary lake, Where the fresh mountain from the bottom boils. These check his fearful steps; and down he sinks, Beneath the shelter of the shapeless drift, Thinking o'er all the bitterness of death; Mix'd with the tender anguish nature shoots Through the wrung bosom of the dying man, His wife, his children, and his friends unseen. In vain for him the officious wife prepares The fire fair-blazing, and the vestment warm; In vain his little children, peeping out Into the mingling storm, demand their sire, With tears of artless innocence. Alas! Nor wife, nor children more shall he behold, Nor friends, nor sacred home. On every nerve The deadly Winter seizes; shuts up sense; And, o'er his inmost vitals creeping cold, Lays him along the snows, a stiffen'd corse, Stretch'd out, and bleaching in the northern blast. Ah! little think the gay licentious proud, Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround; They who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth, And wanton, often cruel, riot waste; Ah! little think they, while they dance along, How many feel, this very moment, death, And all the sad variety of pain. How many sink in the devouring flood, Or more devouring flame. How many bleed, By shameful variance betwixt man and man. How many pine in want, and dungeon glooms; Shut from the common air, and common use Of their own limbs. How many drink the cup Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread Of misery. Sore pierced by wintry winds, How many shrink into the sordid hut Of cheerless poverty. How many shake With all the fiercer tortures of the mind, Unbounded passion, madness, guilt, remorse; Whence tumbled headlong from the height of life, They furnish matter for the tragic Muse. E'en in the vale, where Wisdom loves to dwell, With friendship, peace, and contemplation join'd, How many, rack'd with honest passions, droop In deep retired distress. How many stand Around the deathbed of their dearest friends, And point the parting anguish. Thought fond Man Of these, and all the thousand nameless ills, That one incessant struggle render life, One scene of toil, of suffering, and of fate, Vice in his high career would stand appall'd, And heedless rambling Impulse learn to think; The conscious heart of Charity would warm, And her wide wish Benevolence dilate; The social tear would rise, the social sigh; And into clear perfection, gradual bliss, Refining still, the social passions work. And here can I forget the generous band The jail Committee in the year 1729., Who, touch'd with human woe, redressive search'd Into the horrors of the gloomy jail? Unpitied, and unheard, where misery moans; Where sickness pines; where thirst and hunger burn, And poor misfortune feels the lash of vice. While in the land of Liberty, the land Whose every street and public meeting glow With open freedom, little tyrants raged; Snatch'd the lean morsel from the starving mouth; Tore from cold wintry limbs the tatter'd weed; E'en robb'd them of the last of comforts, sleep; The free-born Briton to the dungeon chain'd, Or, as the lust of cruelty prevail'd, At pleasure mark'd him with inglorious stripes; And crush'd out lives, by secret barbarous ways, That for their country would have toil'd or bled. O great design! if executed well, With patient care, and wisdom-temper'd zeal. Ye sons of Mercy! yet resume the search; Drag forth the legal monsters into light, Wrench from their hands oppression's iron rod, And bid the cruel feel the pains they give. Much still untouch'd remains; in this rank age, Much is the patriot's weeding hand required. The toils of law (what dark insidious men Have cumbrous added to perplex the truth, And lengthen simple justice into trade) How glorious were the day! that saw these broke, And every man within the reach of right. By wintry famine roused, from all the tract Of horrid mountains which the shining Alps, And wavy Appenine, and Pyrenees, Branch out stupendous into distant lands; Cruel as death, and hungry as the grave! Burning for blood! bony, and gaunt, and grim! Assembling wolves in raging troops descend; And, pouring o'er the country, bear along, Keen as the north-wind sweeps the glossy snow. All is their prize. They fasten on the steed, Press him to earth, and pierce his mighty heart. Nor can the bull his awful front defend, Or shake the murdering savages away. Rapacious, at the mother's throat they fly, And tear the screaming infant from her breast. The godlike face of man avails him nought. E'en beauty, force divine! at whose bright glance The generous lion stands in soften'd gaze, Here bleeds, a hapless undistinguish'd prey. But if, apprized of the severe attack, The country be shut up, lured by the scent, On churchyards drear (inhuman to relate!) The disappointed prowlers fall, and dig The shrouded body from the grave; o'er which, Mix'd with foul shades, and frighted ghosts, they howl. Among those hilly regions, where embraced In peaceful vales the happy Grisons dwell; Oft, rushing sudden from the loaded cliffs, Mountains of snow their gathering terrors roll. From steep to steep, loud-thundering down they come, A wintry waste in dire commotion all; And herds, and flocks, and travellers, and swains, And sometimes whole brigades of marching troops, Or hamlets sleeping in the dead of night, Are deep beneath the smothering ruin whelm'd. Now, all amid the rigours of the year, In the wild depth of Winter, while without The ceaseless winds blow ice, be my retreat, Between the groaning forest and the shore Beat by the boundless multitude of waves, A rural, shelter'd, solitary, scene; Where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join, To cheer the gloom. There studious let me sit, And hold high converse with the mighty Dead; Sages of ancient time, as gods revered, As gods beneficent, who bless'd mankind With arts, with arms, and humanized a world. Roused at the inspiring thought, I throw aside The long-lived volume; and, deep-musing, hail The sacred shades, that slowly rising pass Before my wondering eyes. First Socrates, Who, firmly good in a corrupted state, Against the rage of tyrants single stood, Invincible! calm Reason's holy law, That Voice of God within the attentive mind, Obeying, fearless, or in life, or death: Great moral teacher! Wisest of mankind! Solon the next, who built his common-weal On equity's wide base; by tender laws A lively people curbing, yet undamp'd; Preserving still that quick peculiar fire, Whence in the laurel'd field of finer arts And of bold freedom, they unequal'd shone, The pride of smiling Greece, and human-kind. Lycurgus then, who bow'd beneath the force Of strictest discipline, severely wise, All human passions. Following him, I see, As at ThermopylÃ¦ he glorious fell, The firm devoted chief, Leonidas. who proved by deeds The hardest lesson which the other taught. Then Aristides lifts his honest front; Spotless of heart, to whom the unflattering voice Of freedom gave the noblest name of Just; In pure majestic poverty revered; Who, e'en his glory to his country's weal Submitting, swell'd a haughty Rival's Themistocles. fame. Rear'd by his care, of softer ray appears Cimon sweet-soul'd; whose genius, rising strong, Shook off the load of young debauch; abroad The scourge of Persian pride, at home the friend Of every worth and every splendid art; Modest, and simple, in the pomp of wealth. Then the last worthies of declining Greece, Late call'd to glory, in unequal times, Pensive appear. The fair Corinthian boast, Timoleon, happy temper! mild, and firm, Who wept the brother while the tyrant bled. And, equal to the best, the Theban Pair, Pelopidas and Epaminondas. Whose virtues, in heroic concord join'd, Their country raised to freedom, empire, fame. He too, with whom Athenian honour sunk, And left a mass of sordid lees behind, Phocion the Good; in public life severe, To virtue still inexorably firm; But when, beneath his low illustrious roof, Sweet peace and happy wisdom smooth'd his brow, Not friendship softer was, nor love more kind. And he, the last of old Lycurgus' sons, The generous victim to that vain attempt, To save a rotten state, Agis, who saw E'en Sparta's self to servile avarice sunk, The two Achaian heroes close the train: Aratus, who awhile relumed the soul Of fondly lingering liberty in Greece; And he her darling as her latest hope, The gallant PhilopÅmen; who to arms Turn'd the luxurious pomp he could not cure; Or toiling in his farm, a simple swain; Or, bold and skilful, thundering in the field. Of rougher front, a mighty people come! A race of heroes! in those virtuous times Which knew no stain, save that with partial flame Their dearest country they too fondly loved: Her better Founder first, the light of Rome, Numa, who soften'd her rapacious sons: Servius the king, who laid the solid base On which o'er earth the vast republic spread. Then the great consuls venerable rise. The public Father Marcus Junius Brutus. who the private quell'd, As on the dread tribunal sternly sad. He, whom his thankless country could not lose, Camillus, only vengeful to her foes. Fabricius, scorner of all-conquering gold; And Cincinnatus, awful from the plough. Thy willing victim, Regulus. Carthage, bursting loose From all that pleading Nature could oppose, From a whole city's tears, by rigid faith Imperious call'd, and honour's dire command. Scipio, the gentle chief, humanely brave, Who soon the race of spotless glory ran, And, warm in youth, to the poetic shade With Friendship and Philosophy retired. Tully, whose powerful eloquence a while Restrain'd the rapid fate of rushing Rome. Unconquer'd Cato, virtuous in extreme: And thou, unhappy Brutus, kind of heart, Whose steady arm, by awful virtue urged, Lifted the Roman steel against thy friend. Thousands besides the tribute of a verse Demand; but who can count the stars of Heaven? Who sing their influence on this lower world? Behold, who yonder comes! in sober state, Fair, mild, and strong, as is a vernal sun: 'Tis PhÅbus' self, or else the Mantuan Swain! Great Homer too appears, of daring wing, Parent of song! and equal by his side, The British Muse: join'd hand in hand they walk, Darkling, full up the middle steep to fame, Nor absent are those shades, whose skilful touch Pathetic drew the impassion'd heart, and charm'd Transported Athens with the moral scene; Nor those who, tuneful, waked the enchanting lyre. First of your kind! society divine! Still visit thus my nights, for you reserved, And mount my soaring soul to thoughts like yours. Silence, thou lonely power! the door be thine; See on the hallow'd hour that none intrude, Save a few chosen friends, who sometimes deign To bless my humble roof, with sense refined, Learning digested well, exalted faith, Unstudied wit, and humour ever gay. Or from the Muses' hill will Pope descend, To raise the sacred hour, to bid it smile, And with the social spirit warm the heart? For though not sweeter his own Homer sings, Yet is his life the more endearing song. Where art thou, Hammond? thou, the darling pride, The friend and lover of the tuneful throng! Ah why, dear youth, in all the blooming prime Of vernal genius, where disclosing fast Each active worth, each manly virtue lay, Why wert thou ravish'd from our hope so soon? What now avails that noble thirst of fame, Which stung thy fervent breast? that treasured store Of knowledge early gain'd? that eager zeal To serve thy country, glowing in the band Of youthful patriots, who sustain her name; What now, alas! that life-diffusing charm Of sprightly wit? that rapture for the Muse, That heart of friendship, and that soul of joy, Which bade with softest light thy virtues smile? Ah! only show'd, to check our fond pursuits, And teach our humbled hopes that life is vain! Thus in some deep retirement would I pass The winter-glooms, with friends of pliant soul, Or blithe, or solemn, as the theme inspired: With them would search, if Nature's boundless frame Was call'd, late-rising from the void of night, Or sprung eternal from the Eternal Mind; Its life, its laws, its progress, and its end. Hence larger prospects of the beauteous whole Would, gradual, open on our opening minds; And each diffusive harmony unite In full perfection, to the astonish'd eye. Then would we try to scan the moral world, Which, though to us it seems embroil'd, moves on In higher order; fitted and impell'd By Wisdom's finest hand, and issuing all In general good. The sage historic Muse Should next conduct us through the deeps of time: Show us how empire grew, declined, and fell, In scatter'd states; what makes the nations smile, Improves their soil, and gives them double suns; And why they pine beneath the brightest skies, In Nature's richest lap. As thus we talk'd, Our hearts would burn within us, would inhale That portion of divinity, that ray Of purest Heaven, which lights the public soul Of patriots and of heroes. But if doom'd, In powerless humble fortune, to repress These ardent risings of the kindling soul; Then, even superior to ambition, we Would learn the private virtues; how to glide Through shades and plains, along the smoothest stream Of rural life: or snatch'd away by hope, Through the dim spaces of futurity, With earnest eye anticipate those scenes Of happiness and wonder; where the mind, In endless growth and infinite ascent, Rises from state to state, and world to world. But when with these the serious thought is foil'd, We, shifting for relief, would play the shapes Of frolic fancy; and incessant form Those rapid pictures, that assembled train Of fleet ideas, never join'd before, Whence lively Wit excites to gay surprise; Or folly-painting Humour, grave himself, Calls Laughter forth, deep-shaking every nerve. Meantime the village rouses up the fire; While well attested, and as well believed, Heard solemn, goes the goblin story round; Till superstitious horror creeps o'er all. Or, frequent in the sounding hall, they wake The rural gambol. Rustic mirth goes round; The simple joke that takes the shepherd's heart, Easily pleased; the long loud laugh, sincere; The kiss, snatch'd hasty from the side-long maid, On purpose guardless, or pretending sleep: The leap, the slap, the haul; and, shook to notes Of native music, the respondent dance. Thus jocund fleets with them the winter-night. The city swarms intense. The public haunt, Full of each theme and warm with mix'd discourse, Hums indistinct. The sons of riot flow Down the loose stream of false enchanted joy, To swift destruction. On the rankled soul The gaming fury falls; and in one gulf Of total ruin, honour, virtue, peace, Friends, families, and fortune, headlong sink. Upsprings the dance along the lighted dome, Mix'd and evolved, a thousand sprightly ways. The glittering court effuses every pomp; The circle deepens: beam'd from gaudy robes, Tapers, and sparkling gems, and radiant eyes, A soft effulgence o'er the palace waves: While, a gay insect in his summer-shine, The fop, light fluttering, spreads his mealy wings. Dread o'er the scene, the ghost of Hamlet stalks; Othello rages; poor Monimia mourns; And Belvidera pours her soul in love. Terror alarms the breast; the comely tear Steals o'er the cheek: or else the Comic Muse Holds to the world a picture of itself, And raises sly the fair impartial laugh. Sometimes she lifts her strain, and paints the scenes Of beauteous life; whate'er can deck mankind, Or charm the heart, in generous Bevil A character in the Conscious Lovers, by Sir R. Steele. show'd. O Thou, whose wisdom, solid yet refined, Whose patriot-virtues, and consummate skill To touch the finer springs that move the world, Join'd to whate'er the Graces can bestow, And all Apollo's animating fire, Give thee, with pleasing dignity, to shine At once the guardian, ornament, and joy, Of polish'd life; permit the rural Muse, O Chesterfield, to grace with thee her song! Ere to the shades again she humbly flies, Indulge her fond ambition, in thy train, (For every Muse has in thy train a place) To mark thy various full-accomplish'd mind: To mark that spirit, which, with British scorn, Rejects the allurements of corrupted power; That elegant politeness, which excels, E'en in the judgment of presumptuous France, The boasted manners of her shining court; That with the vivid energy of sense, The truth of Nature, which with Attic point And kind well temper'd satire, smoothly keen, Steals through the soul, and without pain corrects. Or rising thence with yet a brighter flame, O let me hail thee on some glorious day, When to the listening senate, ardent, crowd Britannia's sons to hear her pleaded cause. Then dress'd by thee, more amiably fair, Truth the soft robe of mild persuasion wears: Thou to assenting reason givest again Her own enlighten'd thoughts; call'd from the heart, The obedient passions on thy voice attend; And e'en reluctant party feels a while Thy gracious power: as through the varied maze Of eloquence, now smooth, now quick, now strong, Profound and clear, you roll the copious flood. To thy loved haunt return, my happy Muse: For now, behold, the joyous winter days, Frosty, succeed; and through the blue serene, For sight too fine, the ethereal nitre flies; Killing infectious damps, and the spent air Storing afresh with elemental life. Close crowds the shining atmosphere; and binds Our strengthen'd bodies in its cold embrace, Constringent; feeds, and animates our blood; Refines our spirits, through the new-strung nerves, In swifter sallies darting to the brain; Where sits the soul, intense, collected, cool, Bright as the skies, and as the season keen. All Nature feels the renovating force Of Winter, only to the thoughtless eye In ruin seen. The frost-concocted glebe Draws in abundant vegetable soul, And gathers vigour for the coming year, A stronger glow sits on the lively cheek Of ruddy fire: and luculent along The purer rivers flow; their sullen deeps, Transparent, open to the shepherd's gaze, And murmur hoarser at the fixing frost. What art thou, frost? and whence are thy keen stores Derived, thou secret all-invading power, Whom e'en the illusive fluid cannot fly? Is not thy potent energy, unseen, Myriads of little salts, or hook'd, or shaped Like double wedges, and diffused immense Through water, earth, and ether? hence at eve, Steam'd eager from the red horizon round, With the fierce rage of Winter deep suffused, An icy gale, oft shifting, o'er the pool Breathes a blue film, and in its mid career Arrests the bickering stream. The loosen'd ice, Let down the flood, and half dissolved by day, Rustles no more; but to the sedgy bank Fast grows, or gathers round the pointed stone, A crystal pavement, by the breath of Heaven Cemented firm; till, seized from shore to shore, The whole imprison'd river growls below. Loud rings the frozen earth, and hard reflects A double noise; while, at his evening watch, The village dog deters the nightly thief; The heifer lows; the distant water-fall Swells in the breeze; and, with the hasty tread Of traveller, the hollow-sounding plain Shakes from afar. The full ethereal round, Infinite worlds disclosing to the view, Shines out intensely keen; and, all one cope Of starry glitter, glows from pole to pole. From pole to pole the rigid influence falls, Through the still night, incessant, heavy, strong, And seizes Nature fast. It freezes on; Till Morn, late-rising o'er the drooping world, Lifts her pale eye unjoyous. Then appears The various labour of the silent night: Prone from the dripping eave, and dumb cascade, Whose idle torrents only seem to roar, The pendent icicle; the frost-work fair, Where transient hues, and fancied figures rise; Wide-spouted o'er the hill, the frozen brook, A livid tract, cold-gleaming on the morn; The forest bent beneath the plumy wave; And by the frost refined the whiter snow, Incrusted hard, and sounding to the tread Of early shepherd, as he pensive seeks His pining flock, or from the mountain top, Pleased with the slippery surface, swift descends. On blithsome frolics bent, the youthful swains, While every work of man is laid at rest, Fond o'er the river crowd, in various sport And revelry dissolved; where mixing glad, Happiest of all the train! the raptured boy Lashes the whirling top. Or, where the Rhine Branch'd out in many a long canal extends, From every province swarming, void of care, Batavia rushes forth; and as they sweep, On sounding skates, a thousand different ways, In circling poise, swift as the winds, along, The then gay land is madden'd all to joy. Nor less the northern courts, wide o'er the snow, Pour a new pomp. Eager, on rapid sleds, Their vigorous youth in bold contention wheel The long-resounding course. Meantime to raise The manly strife, with highly blooming charms, Flush'd by the season, Scandinavia's dames, Or Russia's buxom daughters, glow around. Pure, quick, and sportful is the wholesome day; But soon elapsed. The horizontal sun, Broad o'er the south, hangs at his utmost noon: And, ineffectual, strikes the gelid cliff: His azure gloss the mountain still maintains, Nor feels the feeble touch. Perhaps the vale Relents awhile to the reflected ray: Or from the forest falls the cluster'd snow, Myriads of gems, that in the waving gleam Gay-twinkle as they scatter. Thick around Thunders the sport of those, who with the gun, And dog impatient bounding at the shot, Worse than the Season, desolate the fields; And, adding to the ruins of the year, Distress the footed or the feather'd game. But what is this? our infant Winter sinks, Divested of his grandeur, should our eye Astonish'd shoot into the frigid zone; Where, for relentless months, continual Night Holds o'er the glittering waste her starry reign. There, through the prison of unbounded wilds, Barr'd by the hand of Nature from escape, Wide roams the Russian exile. Nought around Strikes his sad eye, but deserts lost in snow; And heavy-loaded groves; and solid floods, That stretch athwart the solitary waste, Their icy horrors to the frozen main; And cheerless towns far distant, never bless'd, Save when its annual course the caravan Bends to the golden coast of rich Cathay, The old name for China. With news of human-kind. Yet there life glows; Yet cherish'd there, beneath the shining waste, The furry nations harbour: tipp'd with jet, Fair ermines, spotless as the snows they press; Sables, of glossy black; and dark-embrown'd, Or beauteous freak'd with many a mingled hue, Thousands besides, the costly pride of courts. There, warm together press'd, the trooping deer Sleep on the new-fallen snows; and, scarce his head Raised o'er the heapy wreath, the branching elk Lies slumbering sullen in the white abyss. The ruthless hunter wants nor dogs nor toils, Nor with the dread of sounding bows he drives The fearful flying race; with ponderous clubs, As weak against the mountain-heaps they push Their beating breast in vain, and piteous bray, He lays them quivering on the ensanguined snows, And with loud shouts rejoicing bears them home. There through the piny forest half-absorp'd, Rough tenant of these shades, the shapeless bear, With dangling ice all horrid, stalks forlorn; Slow-paced, and sourer as the storms increase, He makes his bed beneath the inclement drift, And, with stern patience, scorning weak complaint, Hardens his heart against assailing want. Wide o'er the spacious regions of the north, That see BoÃ¶tes urge his tardy wain, A boisterous race, by frosty Caurus North-west wind. pierced, Who little pleasure know and fear no pain, Prolific swarm. They once relumed the flame Of lost mankind in polish'd slavery sunk; Drove martial horde on horde, The wandering Scythian clans. with dreadful sweep Resistless rushing o'er the enfeebled south, And gave the vanquish'd world another form. Not such the sons of Lapland: wisely they Despise the insensate barbarous trade of war; They ask no more than simple Nature gives, They love their mountains, and enjoy their storms. No false desires, no pride-created wants, Disturb the peaceful current of their time; And through the restless ever tortured maze Of pleasure, or ambition, bid it rage. Their reindeer form their riches. These their tents, Their robes, their beds, and all their homely wealth Supply, their wholesome fare and cheerful cups. Obsequious at their call, the docile tribe Yield to the sled their necks, and whirl them swift O'er hill and dale, heap'd into one expanse Of marbled snow, as far as eye can sweep With a blue crust of ice unbounded glazed. By dancing meteors then, that ceaseless shake A waving blaze refracted o'er the heavens, And vivid moons, and stars that keener play With doubled lustre from the glossy waste, E'en in the depth of polar night, they find A wondrous day: enough to light the chase, Or guide their daring steps to Finland fairs. Wish'd Spring returns; and from the hazy south, While dim Aurora slowly moves before, The welcome sun, just verging up at first, By small degrees extends the swelling curve! Till seen at last for gay rejoicing months, Still round and round, his spiral course he winds, And as he nearly dips his flaming orb, Wheels up again, and reascends the sky. In that glad season from the lakes and floods, Where pure Niemi's M. de Maupertuis, in his book on the Figure of the Earth, after having described the beautiful lake and mountain of Niemi, in Lapland, says, âFrom this height we had opportunity several times to see those vapours rise from the lake, which the people of the country call Haltios, and which they deem to be the guardian spirits of the mountains. We had been frighted with stories of bears that haunted this place, but saw none. It seemed rather a place of resort for fairies and genii, than bears.â fairy mountains rise, And fringed with roses Tenglio The same author observes, âI was surprised to see upon the banks of this river (the Tenglio) roses of as lively a red as any that are in our gardens.â rolls his stream, They draw the copious fry. With these, at eve, They cheerful loaded to their tents repair; Where, all day long in useful cares employ'd, Their kind unblemish'd wives the fire prepare. Thrice happy race! by poverty secured From legal plunder and rapacious power: In whom fell interest never yet has sown The seeds of vice: whose spotless swains ne'er knew Injurious deed, nor, blasted by the breath Of faithless love, their blooming daughters woe. Still pressing on, beyond Tornea's lake, And Hecla flaming through a waste of snow, And farthest Greenland, to the pole itself, Where, failing gradual, life at length goes out, The Muse expands her solitary flight; And, hovering o'er the wild stupendous scene, Beholds new seas beneath another sky. The other hemisphere. Throned in his palace of cerulean ice, Here Winter holds his unrejoicing court; And through his airy hall the loud misrule Of driving tempest is for ever heard: Here the grim tyrant meditates his wrath; Here arms his winds with all subduing frost; Moulds his fierce hail, and treasures up his snows, With which he now oppresses half the globe. Thence winding eastward to the Tartar's coast, She sweeps the howling margin of the main; Where undissolving, from the first of time, Snows swell on snows amazing to the sky; And icy mountains high on mountains piled, Seem to the shivering sailor from afar, Shapeless and white, an atmosphere of clouds. Projected huge, and horrid o'er the surge, Alps frown on Alps; or rushing hideous down, As if old Chaos was again return'd, Wide-rend the deep, and shake the solid pole. Ocean itself no longer can resist The binding fury: but, in all its rage Of tempest taken by the boundless frost, Is many a fathom to the bottom chain'd, And bid to roar no more: a bleak expanse, Shagg'd o'er with wavy rocks, cheerless, and void Of every life, that from the dreary months Flies conscious southward. Miserable they! Who, here entangled in the gathering ice, Take their last look of the descending sun; While, full of death, and fierce with tenfold frost, The long long night, incumbent o'er their heads, Falls horrible. Such was the Briton's Sir Hugh Willoughby, sent by Queen Elizabeth to discover the north-east passage. fate, As with first prow, (what have not Britons dared!) He for the passage sought, attempted since So much in vain, and seeming to be shut By jealous Nature with eternal bars. In these fell regions, in Arzina caught, And to the stony deep his idle ship Immediate seal'd, he with his hapless crew Each full exerted at his several task, Froze into statues; to the cordage glued The sailor, and the pilot to the helm. Hard by these shores, where scarce his freezing stream Rolls the wild Oby, live the last of men; And half enliven'd by the distant sun, That rears and ripens man, as well as plants, Here human nature wears its rudest form. Deep from the piercing season sunk in caves, Here by dull fires, and with unjoyous cheer, They waste the tedious gloom. Immersed in furs, Doze the gross race. Nor sprightly jest nor song, Nor tenderness they know; nor aught of life, Beyond the kindred bears that stalk without, Till morn at length, her roses drooping all, Sheds a long twilight brightening o'er their fields, And calls the quiver'd savage to the chase. What cannot active government perform, New-moulding man? Wide-stretching from these shores, A people savage from remotest time, A huge neglected empire, one vast mind, By Heaven inspired, from gothic darkness call'd. Immortal Peter! first of monarchs! he His stubborn country tamed, her rocks, her fens, Her floods, her seas, her ill-submitting sons; And while the fierce barbarian he subdued, To more exalted soul he raised the man. Ye shades of ancient heroes, ye who toil'd Through long successive ages to build up A labouring plan of state, behold at once The wonder done! behold the matchless prince! Who left his native throne, where reign'd till then A mighty shadow of unreal power; Who greatly spurn'd the slothful pomp of courts; And roaming every land, in every port His sceptre laid aside, with glorious hand Unwearied plying the mechanic tool, Gather'd the seeds of trade, of useful arts, Of civil wisdom, and of martial skill. Charged with the stores of Europe home he goes! Then cities rise amid the illumined waste; O'er joyless deserts smiles the rural reign; Far distant flood to flood is social join'd; The astonish'd Euxine hears the Baltic roar; Proud navies ride on seas that never foam'd With daring keel before; and armies stretch Each way their dazzling files, repressing here The frantic Alexander of the north, And awing there stern Othman's shrinking sons. Sloth flies the land, and Ignorance, and Vice, Of old dishonour proud: it glows around, Taught by the Royal Hand that roused the whole, One scene of arts, of arms, of rising trade: For what his wisdom plann'd, and power enforced, More potent still, his great example show'd. Muttering, the winds at eve, with blunted point, Blow hollow blustering from the south. Subdued, The frost resolves into a trickling thaw. Spotted the mountains shine; loose sleet descends, And floods the country round. The rivers swell, Of bonds impatient. Sudden from the hills, O'er rocks and woods, in broad brown cataracts, A thousand snow-fed torrents shoot at once; And, where they rush, the wide resounding plain Is left one slimy waste. Those sullen seas, That wash'd the ungenial pole, will rest no more Beneath the shackles of the mighty north; But, rousing all their waves, resistless heave. And hark! the lengthening roar continuous runs Athwart the rifted deep: at once it bursts, And piles a thousand mountains to the clouds. Ill fares the bark with trembling wretches charged, That, toss'd amid the floating fragments, moors Beneath the shelter of an icy isle, While night o'erwhelms the sea, and horror looks More horrible. Can human force endure The assembled mischiefs that besiege them round? Heart-gnawing hunger, fainting weariness, The roar of winds and waves, the crush of ice, Now ceasing, now renew'd with louder rage, And in dire echoes bellowing round the main. More to embroil the deep, leviathan And his unwieldy train, in dreadful sport, Tempest the loosen'd brine, while through the gloom, Far from the bleak inhospitable shore, Loading the winds, is heard the hungry howl Of famish'd monsters, there awaiting wrecks. Yet Providence, that ever waking eye, Looks down with pity on the feeble toil Of mortals lost to hope, and lights them safe, Through all this dreary labyrinth of fate. 'Tis done! dread Winter spreads his latest glooms, And reigns tremendous o'er the conquer'd Year. How dead the vegetable kingdom lies! How dumb the tuneful! horror wide extends His desolate domain. Behold, fond man! See here thy pictured life; pass some few years, Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer's ardent strength, Thy sober Autumn fading into age, And pale concluding Winter comes at last, And shuts the scene. Ah! whither now are fled Those dreams of greatness? those unsolid hopes Of happiness? those longings after fame? Those restless cares? those busy bustling days? Those gay-spent, festive nights? those veering thoughts, Lost between good and ill, that shared thy life? All now are vanish'd! Virtue sole survives, Immortal never failing friend of man, His guide to happiness on high. And see! 'Tis come, the glorious morn! the second birth Of heaven and earth! awakening Nature hears The new creating word, and starts to life, In every heighten'd form, from pain and death For ever free. The great eternal scheme, Involving all, and in a perfect whole Uniting, as the prospect wider spreads, To reason's eye refined clear up apace. Ye vainly wise! ye blind presumptuous! now, Confounded in the dust, adore that Power And Wisdom oft arraign'd: see now the cause, Why unassuming worth in secret lived, And died, neglected: why the good man's share In life was gall and bitterness of soul: Why the lone widow and her orphans pined In starving solitude; while luxury, In palaces, lay straining her low thought, To form unreal wants: why heaven-born truth, And moderation fair, wore the red marks Of superstition's scourge: why licensed pain, That cruel spoiler, that embosom'd foe, Embitter'd all our bliss. Ye good distress'd! Ye noble few! who here unbending stand Beneath life's pressure, yet bear up a while, And what your bounded view, which only saw A little part, deem'd evil is no more: The storms of Wintry Time will quickly pass, And one unbounded Spring encircle all. HYMN. These, as they change, Almighty Father, these Are but the varied God. The rolling year Is full of Thee. Forth in the pleasing Spring Thy beauty walks, thy tenderness and love. Wide flush the fields; the softening air is balm; Echo the mountains round; the forest smiles; And every sense, and every heart is joy. Then comes thy glory in the Summer-months, With light and heat refulgent. Then thy sun Shoots full perfection through the swelling year: And oft thy voice in dreadful thunder speaks: And oft at dawn, deep noon, or falling eve, By brooks and groves, in hollow-whispering gales Thy bounty shines in Autumn unconfined, And spreads a common feast for all that lives. In Winter awful Thou! with clouds and storms Around Thee thrown, tempest o'er tempest roll'd. Majestic darkness! on the whirlwind's wing, Riding sublime, Thou bidst the world adore, And humblest Nature with thy northern blast. Mysterious round! what skill, what force divine, Deep felt, in these appear! a simple train, Yet so delightful mix'd, with such kind art, Such beauty and beneficence combined; Shade, unperceived, so softening into shade; And all so forming an harmonious whole; That, as they still succeed, they ravish still. But wandering oft, with brute unconscious gaze, Man marks not Thee, marks not the mighty hand, That, ever busy, wheels the silent spheres; Works in the secret deep; shoots, steaming, thence The fair profusion that o'erspreads the Spring: Flings from the sun direct the flaming day; Feeds every creature; hurls the tempest forth; And, as on earth this grateful change revolves, With transport touches all the springs of life. Nature attend! join, every living soul, Beneath the spacious temple of the sky, In adoration join; and, ardent, raise One general song! To Him, ye vocal gales, Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness breathes: Oh, talk of Him in solitary glooms! Where, o'er the rock, the scarcely waving pine Fills the brown shade with a religious awe. And ye, whose bolder note is heard afar, Who shake the astonish'd world, lift high to heaven The impetuous song, and say from whom you rage. His praise, ye brooks, attune, ye trembling rills; And let me catch it as I muse along. Ye headlong torrents, rapid, and profound; Ye softer floods, that lead the humid maze Along the vale; and thou, majestic main, A secret world of wonders in thyself, Sound His stupendous praise; whose greater voice Or bids you roar, or bids your roarings fall. Soft roll your incense, herbs, and fruits, and flowers, In mingled clouds to Him; whose sun exalts, Whose breath perfumes you, and whose pencil paints, Ye forests, bend, ye harvests, wave, to Him; Breathe your still song into the reaper's heart, As home he goes beneath the joyous moon. Ye that keep watch in heaven, as earth asleep Unconscious lies, effuse your mildest beams, Ye constellations, while your angels strike, Amid the spangled sky, the silver lyre. Great source of day! best image here below Of thy Creator, ever pouring wide, From world to world, the vital ocean round, On Nature write with every beam His praise. The thunder rolls: be hush'd the prostrate world: While cloud to cloud returns the solemn hymn. Bleat out afresh, ye hills: ye mossy rocks, Retain the sound: the broad responsive low, Ye valleys, raise; for the Great Shepherd reigns; And his unsuffering kingdom yet will come. Ye woodlands all, awake: a boundless song Burst from the groves! and when the restless day, Expiring, lays the warbling world asleep, Sweetest of birds! sweet Philomela, charm The listening shades, and teach the night His praise. Ye chief, for whom the whole creation smiles, At once the head, the heart, and tongue of all, Crown the great hymn; in swarming cities vast, Assembled men, to the deep organ join The long resounding voice, oft-breaking clear, At solemn pauses, through the swelling base; And, as each mingling flame increases each, In one united ardour rise to heaven. Or if you rather choose the rural shade, And find a fane in every sacred grove; There let the shepherd's flute, the virgin's lay, The prompting seraph, and the poet's lyre, Still sing the God of Seasons, as they roll! For me, when I forget the darling theme, Whether the blossom blows, the summer-ray Russets the plain, inspiring Autumn gleams; Or Winter rises in the blackening east; Be my tongue mute, may fancy paint no more, And, dead to joy, forget my heart to beat! Should fate command me to the farthest verge Of the green earth, to distant barbarous climes, Rivers unknown to song; where first the sun Gilds Indian mountains, or his setting beam Flames on the Atlantic isles; 'tis nought to me: Since God is ever present, ever felt, In the void waste as in the city full; And where He vital breathes there must be joy. When even at last the solemn hour shall come, And wing my mystic flight to future worlds, I cheerful will obey; there, with new powers, Will rising wonders sing: I cannot go Where Universal Love not smiles around, Sustaining all yon orbs, and all their sons; From seeming Evil still educing Good, And better thence again, and better still, In infinite progression. But I lose Myself in Him, in Light ineffable! Come then, expressive Silence, muse his praise.</field>

This poem being writ in the manner of Spenser, the obsolete words, and a simplicity of diction in some of the lines, which borders on the ludicrous, were necessary to make the imitation more perfect. And the style of that admirable poet, as well as the measure in which he wrote, are, as it were, appropriated by custom to all allegorical Poems writ in our language; just as in French, the style of Marot, who lived under Francis the First, has been used in tales, and familiar epistles, by the politest writers of the age of Louis the Fourteenth. CANTO I. The castle hight of Indolence, And its false luxury; Where for a little time, alas! We lived right jollily. I O mortal man, who livest here by toil, Do not complain of this thy hard estate; That like an emmet thou must ever moil, Is a sad sentence of an ancient date: And, certes, there is for it reason great; For, though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail, And curse thy star, and early drudge and late; Withouten that would come a heavier bale, Loose life, unruly passions, and diseases pale. II In lowly dale, fast by a river's side, With woody hill o'er hill encompass'd round, A most enchanting wizard did abide, Than whom a fiend more fell is no where found. It was, I ween, a lovely spot of ground; And there a season atween June and May, Half prankt with spring, with summer half imbrown'd, A listless climate made, where, sooth to say, No living wight could work, ne cared even for play. III Was nought around but images of rest: Sleep-soothing groves, and quiet lawns between; And flowery beds that slumbrous influence kest, From poppies breathed; and beds of pleasant green, Where never yet was creeping creature seen. Meantime, unnumber'd glittering streamlets play'd, And hurled every where their waters sheen; That, as they bicker'd through the sunny glade, Though restless still themselves, a lulling murmur made. IV Join'd to the prattle of the purling rills Were heard the lowing herds along the vale, And flocks loud bleating from the distant hills, And vacant shepherds piping in the dale: And, now and then, sweet Philomel would wail, Or stock-doves plain amid the forest deep, That drowsy rustled to the sighing gale; And still a coil the grasshopper did keep; Yet all these sounds yblent inclined all to sleep. V Full in the passage of the vale, above, A sable, silent, solemn forest stood; Where nought but shadowy forms was seen to move, As Idless fancied in her dreaming mood: And up the hills, on either side, a wood Of blackening pines, aye waving to and fro, Sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood; And where this valley winded out, below, The murmuring main was heard, and scarcely heard, to flow. VI A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass, For ever flushing round a summer-sky: There eke the soft delights, that witchingly Instil a wanton sweetness through the breast, And the calm pleasures always hover'd nigh; But whate'er smack'd of noyance, or unrest, Was far, far off expell'd from this delicious nest. VII The landscape such, inspiring perfect ease, Where Indolence (for so the wizard hight) Close-hid his castle mid embowering trees, That half shut out the beams of PhÅbus bright, And made a kind of checker'd day and night; Meanwhile, unceasing at the massy gate, Beneath a spacious palm, the wicked wight Was placed; and to his lute, of cruel fate And labour harsh, complain'd, lamenting man's estate. VIII Thither continual pilgrims crowded still, From all the roads of earth that pass there by: For, as they chaunced to breathe on neighbouring hill, The freshness of this valley smote their eye, And drew them ever and anon more nigh; Till clustering round the enchanter false they hung, Ymolten with his syren melody; While o'er the enfeebling lute his hand he flung, And to the trembling chords these tempting verses sung; IX âBehold! ye pilgrims of this earth, behold! See all, but man, with unearn'd pleasure gay: See her bright robes the butterfly unfold, Broke from her wintry tomb in prime of May! What youthful bride can equal her array? Who can with her for easy pleasure vie? From mead to mead with gentle wing to stray, From flower to flower on balmy gales to fly, Is all she has to do beneath the radiant sky. X âBehold the merry minstrels of the morn, The swarming songsters of the careless grove, Ten thousand throats! that, from the flowering thorn, Hymn their good God, and carol sweet of love, Such grateful kindly raptures them emove: They neither plough, nor sow; ne, fit for flail, E'er to the barn the nodden sheaves they drove; Yet theirs each harvest dancing in the gale, Whatever crowns the hill, or smiles along the vale. XI âOutcast of nature, man! the wretched thrall Of bitter dropping sweat, of sweltry pain, Of cares that eat away the heart with gall, And of the vices, an inhuman train, That all proceed from savage thirst of gain: For when hard-hearted interest first began To poison earth, AstrÃ¦a left the plain; Guile, violence, and murder seized on man, And, for soft milky streams, with blood the rivers ran. XII âCome, ye, who still the cumbrous load of life Push hard up hill; but as the furthest steep You trust to gain, and put an end to strife, Down thunders back the stone with mighty sweep, And hurls your labours to the valley deep, For ever vain: come, and withouten fee, I in oblivion will your sorrows steep, Your cares, your toils; will steep you in a sea Of full delight: O come, ye weary wights, to me! XIII âWith me, you need not rise at early dawn, To pass the joyless day in various stounds; Or, louting low, on upstart fortune fawn, And sell fair honour for some paltry pounds; Or through the city take your dirty rounds, To cheat, and dun, and lie, and visit pay, Now flattering base, now giving secret wounds; Or prowl in courts of law for human prey, In venal senate thieve, or rob on broad highway. XIV âNo cocks, with me, to rustic labour call, From village on to village sounding clear; To tardy swain no shrill-voiced matrons squall; No dogs, no babes, no wives, to stun your ear; No hammers thump; no horrid blacksmith sear, Ne noisy tradesman your sweet slumbers start, With sounds that are a misery to hear: But all is calm, as would delight the heart Of Sybarite of old, all nature, and all art. XV âHere nought but candour reigns, indulgent ease, Good-natured lounging, sauntering up and down. They who are pleased themselves must always please; On others' ways they never squint a frown, Nor heed what haps in hamlet or in town: Thus, from the source of tender Indolence, With milky blood the heart is overflown, Is sooth'd and sweeten'd by the social sense; For interest, envy, pride, and strife are banish'd hence. XVI âWhat, what is virtue, but repose of mind, A pure ethereal calm, that knows no storm; Above the reach of wild ambition's wind, Above those passions that this world deform, And torture man, a proud malignant worm? But here, instead, soft gales of passion play, And gently stir the heart, thereby to form A quicker sense of joy; as breezes stray Across the enliven'd skies, and make them still more gay. XVII âThe best of men have ever loved repose: They hate to mingle in the filthy fray; Where the soul sours, and gradual rancour grows, Imbitter'd more from peevish day to day. E'en those whom fame has lent her fairest ray, The most renown'd of worthy wights of yore, From a base world at last have stolen away: So Scipio, to the soft CumÃ¦an shore Retiring, tasted joy he never knew before. XVIII âBut if a little exercise you choose, Some zest for ease, 'tis not forbidden here: Amid the groves you may indulge the Muse, Or tend the blooms, and deck the vernal year; Or softly stealing, with your watery gear, Along the brooks, the crimson-spotted fry You may delude: the whilst, amused, you hear Now the hoarse stream, and now the zephyr's sigh, Attuned to the birds, and woodland melody. XIX âO grievous folly! to heap up estate, Losing the days you see beneath the sun; When, sudden, comes blind unrelenting fate, And gives the untasted portion you have won With ruthless toil, and many a wretch undone, To those who mock you, gone to Pluto's reign, There with sad ghosts to pine, and shadows dun: But sure it is of vanities most vain, To toil for what you here untoiling may obtain.â XX He ceased. But still their trembling ears retain'd The deep vibrations of his witching song; That, by a kind of magic power, constrain'd To enter in, pell-mell, the listening throng. Heaps pour'd on heaps, and yet they slipt along, In silent ease; as when beneath the beam Of summer-moons, the distant woods among, Or by some flood all silver'd with the gleam, The soft-embodied fays through airy portal stream: XXI By the smooth demon so it order'd was, And here his baneful bounty first began: Though some there were who would not further pass, And his alluring baits suspected han. The wise distrust the too fair-spoken man. Yet through the gate they cast a wishful eye: Not to move on, perdie, is all they can: For do their very best they cannot fly, But often each way look, and often sorely sigh. XXII When this the watchful wicked wizard saw, With sudden spring he leap'd upon them straight; And soon as touch'd by his unhallow'd paw, They found themselves within the cursed gate; Full hard to be repass'd, like that of fate. Not stronger were of old the giant crew, Who sought to pull high Jove from regal state; Though feeble wretch he seem'd, of sallow hue: Certes, who bides his grasp, will that encounter rue. XXIII For whomsoe'er the villain takes in hand, Their joints unknit, their sinews melt apace; As lithe they grow as any willow-wand, And of their vanish'd force remains no trace: So when a maiden fair, of modest grace, In all her buxom blooming May of charms, Is seized in some losel's hot embrace, She waxeth very weakly as she warms, Then sighing yields her up to love's delicious harms. XXIV Waked by the crowd, slow from his bench arose A comely, full-spread porter, swoln with sleep: His calm, broad, thoughtless aspect breathed repose; And in sweet torpor he was plunged deep, Ne could himself from ceaseless yawning keep; While o'er his eyes the drowsy liquor ran, Through which his half-waked soul would faintly peep: Then taking his black staff, he call'd his man, And roused himself as much as rouse himself he can. XXV The lad leap'd lightly at his master's call: He was, to weet, a little roguish page, Save sleep and play who minded nought at all, Like most the untaught striplings of his age. This boy he kept each band to disengage, Garters and buckles, task for him unfit, But ill becoming his grave personage, And which his portly paunch would not permit; So this same limber page to all performed it. XXVI Meantime, the master-porter wide display'd Great store of caps, of slippers, and of gowns; Wherewith he those who enter'd in array'd Loose, as the breeze that plays along the downs, And waves the summer-woods when evening frowns: O fair undress, best dress! it checks no vein, But every flowing limb in pleasure drowns, And heightens ease with grace. This done, right fain, Sir porter sat him down, and turn'd to sleep again. XXVII Thus easy robed, they to the fountain sped That in the middle of the court up-threw A stream, high spouting from its liquid bed, And falling back again in drizzly dew; There each deep draughts, as deep he thirsted, drew; It was a fountain of nepenthe rare; Whence, as Dan Homer sings, huge pleasance grew, And sweet oblivion of vile earthly care; Fair gladsome waking thoughts, and joyous dreams more fair. XXVIII This right perform'd, all inly pleased and still, Withouten tromp, was proclamation made: âYe sons of Indolence, do what you will; And wander where you list, through hall or glade; Be no man's pleasure for another staid; Let each as likes him best his hours employ, And cursed be he who minds his neighbour's trade! Here dwells kind ease and unreproving joy: He little merits bliss who others can annoy.â XXIX Straight of these endless numbers, swarming round, As thick as idle motes in sunny ray, Not one eftsoons in view was to be found, But every man stroll'd off his own glad way, Wide o'er this ample court's blank area, With all the lodges that thereto pertain'd, No living creature could be seen to stray; While solitude, and perfect silence reign'd; So that to think you dreamt you almost was constrain'd. XXX As when a shepherd of the Hebrid-Isles, Those isles on the W. coast of Scotland, called the Hebrides. Placed far amid the melancholy main, (Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles; Or that aÃ«rial beings sometimes deign To stand, embodied, to our senses plain) Sees on the naked hill, or valley low, The whilst in ocean PhÅbus dips his wain, A vast assembly moving to and fro: Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show. XXXI Ye gods of quiet, and of sleep profound! Whose soft dominion o'er this castle sways, And all the widely silent places round, Forgive me, if my trembling pen displays What never yet was sung in mortal lays. But how shall I attempt such arduous string? I who have spent my nights, and nightly days, In this soul-deadening place loose-loitering: Ah! how shall I for this uprear my moulted wing? XXXII Come on, my muse, nor stoop to low despair, Thou imp of Jove, touch'd by celestial fire! Thou yet shalt sing of war, and actions fair, Which the bold sons of Britain will inspire; Of ancient bards thou yet shalt sweep the lyre; Thou yet shalt tread in tragic pall the stage, Paint love's enchanting woes, the hero's ire, The sage's calm, the patriot's noble rage, Dashing corruption down through every worthless age. XXXIII The doors, that knew no shrill alarming bell, Ne cursed knocker plied by villain's hand, Self-open'd into halls, where, who can tell What elegance and grandeur wide expand; The pride of Turkey and of Persia land? Soft quilts on quilts, on carpets carpets spread, And couches stretch'd around in seemly band; And endless pillows rise to prop the head; So that each spacious room was one full-swelling bed; XXXIV And every where huge cover'd tables stood, With wines high-flavour'd and rich viands crown'd; Whatever sprightly juice or tasteful food On the green bosom of this earth are found, And all old ocean 'genders in his round: Some hand unseen these silently display'd, Even undemanded by a sign or sound; You need but wish, and, instantly obey'd, Fair ranged the dishes rose, and thick the glasses play'd. XXXV Here freedom reign'd, without the least alloy; Nor gossip's tale, nor ancient maiden's gall, Nor saintly spleen durst murmur at our joy, And with envenom'd tongue our pleasures pall. For why? there was but one great rule for all; To wit, that each should work his own desire, And eat, drink, study, sleep, as it may fall, Or melt the time in love, or wake the lyre, And carol what, unbid, the muses might inspire. XXXVI The rooms with costly tapestry were hung, Where was inwoven many a gentle tale; Such as of old the rural poets sung, Or of Arcadian or Sicilian vale: Reclining lovers, in the lonely dale, Pour'd forth at large the sweetly tortured heart; Or, sighing tender passion, swell'd the gale, And taught charm'd echo to resound their smart; While flocks, woods, streams around, repose and peace impart. XXXVII Those pleased the most, where, by a cunning hand, Depainted was the patriarchal age; What time Dan Abraham left the Chaldee land, And pastured on from verdant stage to stage, Where fields and fountains fresh could best engage. Toil was not then: of nothing took they heed, But with wild beasts the silvan war to wage, And o'er vast plains their herds and flocks to feed: Bless'd sons of nature they! true golden age indeed! XXXVIII Sometimes the pencil, in cool airy halls, Bade the gay bloom of vernal landscapes rise, Or Autumn's varied shades imbrown the walls: Now the black tempest strikes the astonish'd eyes; Now down the steep the flashing torrent flies; The trembling sun now plays o'er ocean blue, And now rude mountains frown amid the skies; Whate'er Lorraine light-touch'd with softening hue, Or savage Rosa dash'd, or learned Poussin drew. XXXIX Each sound too here to languishment inclined, Lull'd the weak bosom, and induced ease: AÃ«rial music in the warbling wind, At distance rising oft, by small degrees, Nearer and nearer came, till o'er the trees It hung, and breathed such soul-dissolving airs, As did, alas! with soft perdition please: Entangled deep in its enchanting snares, The listening heart forgot all duties and all cares. XL A certain music, never known before, Here lull'd the pensive, melancholy mind; Full easily obtain'd. Behoves no more, But sidelong, to the gently waving wind, To lay the well tuned instrument reclined; From which, with airy flying fingers light, Beyond each mortal touch the most refined, The god of winds drew sounds of deep delight: Whence, with just cause, the harp of Ãolus it hight. The Ãolian harp, here designated, has been greatly improved in its structure by a kindred poet, the author of âThe Farmer's Boy.â XLI Ah me! what hand can touch the string so fine? Who up the lofty diapasan roll Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine, Then let them down again into the soul: Now rising love they fann'd; now pleasing dole They breathed, in tender musings, thro' the heart; And now a graver sacred strain they stole, As when seraphic hands a hymn impart: Wild warbling nature all, above the reach of art! XLII Such the gay splendour, the luxurious state, Of Caliphs old, who on the Tygris' shore, In mighty Bagdat, populous and great, Held their bright court, where was of ladies store; And verse, love, music, still the garland wore: When sleep was coy, the bard, The Arabian Caliphs had poets among the officers of their court, whose office it was to do what is here described. in waiting there, Cheer'd the lone midnight with the muse's lore; Composing music bade his dreams be fair, And music lent new gladness to the morning air. XLIII Near the pavilions where we slept, still ran Soft tinkling streams, and dashing waters fell, And sobbing breezes sigh'd, and oft began (So work'd the wizard) wintry storms to swell, As heaven and earth they would together mell: At doors and windows, threatening, seem'd to call The demons of the tempest, growling fell, Yet the least entrance found they none at all; Whence sweeter grew our sleep, secure in massy hall. XLIV And hither Morpheus sent his kindest dreams, Raising a world of gayer tinct and grace; O'er which were shadowy cast elysian gleams, That play'd, in waving lights, from place to place, And shed a roseate smile on nature's face. Not Titian's pencil e'er could so array, So fleece with clouds the pure ethereal space; Ne could it e'er such melting forms display, As loose on flowery beds all languishingly lay. XLV No, fair illusions! artful phantoms, no! My Muse will not attempt your fairy land: She has no colours that like you can glow: To catch your vivid scenes too gross her hand. But sure it is, was ne'er a subtler band Than these same guileful angel-seeming sprights, Who thus in dreams voluptuous, soft, and bland, Pour'd all the Arabian heaven upon our nights, And bless'd them oft besides with more refined delights. XLVI They were, in sooth, a most enchanting train, Even feigning virtue; skilful to unite With evil good, and strew with pleasure pain. But for those fiends, whom blood and broils delight; Who hurl the wretch, as if to hell outright, Down down black gulfs, where sullen waters sleep, Or hold him clambering all the fearful night On beetling cliffs, or pent in ruins deep; They, till due time should serve, were bid far hence to keep. XLVII Ye guardian spirits, to whom man is dear, From these foul demons shield the midnight gloom: Angels of fancy and of love, be near, And o'er the blank of sleep diffuse a bloom: Evoke the sacred shades of Greece and Rome, And let them virtue with a look impart: But chief, a while, O! lend us from the tomb Those long lost friends for whom in love we smart, And fill with pious awe and joy-mix'd woe the heart. XLVIII Or are you sportiveâBid the morn of youth Rise to new light, and beam afresh the days Of innocence, simplicity, and truth; To cares estranged, and manhood's thorny ways. What transport, to retrace our boyish plays, Our easy bliss, when each thing joy supplied; The woods, the mountains, and the warbling maze Of the wild brooks!âbut, fondly wandering wide, My Muse, resume the task that yet doth thee abide. XLIX One great amusement of our household was, In a huge crystal magic globe to spy, Still as you turn'd it, all things that do pass Upon this ant-hill earth; where constantly Of idly busy men the restless fry Run bustling to and fro with foolish haste, In search of pleasures vain that from them fly, Or which, obtain'd, the caitiffs dare not taste:â When nothing is enjoy'd, can there be greater waste? L âOf vanity the mirror,â this was call'd: Here, you a muckworm of the town might see, At his dull desk, amid his ledgers stall'd, Eat up with carking care and penury; Most like to carcase parch'd on gallow-tree. âA penny saved is a penny got:â Firm to this scoundrel maxim keepeth he, Ne of its rigour will he bate a jot, Till it has quench'd his fire, and banished his pot. LI Straight from the filth of this low grub, behold! Comes fluttering forth a gaudy spendthrift heir, All glossy gay, enamel'd all with gold, The silly tenant of the summer air, In folly lost, of nothing takes he care; Pimps, lawyers, stewards, harlots, flatterers vile, And thieving tradesmen him among them share: His father's ghost from limbo lake, the while, Sees this, which more damnation doth upon him pile. LII This globe pourtray'd the race of learned men, Still at their books, and turning o'er the page, Backwards and forwards: oft they snatch the pen, As if inspired, and in a Thespian rage; Then write, and blot, as would your ruth engage: Why, authors, all this scrawl and scribbling sore? To lose the present, gain the future age, Praised to be when you can hear no more, And much enrich'd with fame, when useless worldly store. LIII Then would a splendid city rise to view, With carts, and cars, and coaches roaring all: Wide-pour'd abroad behold the giddy crew: See how they dash along from wall to wall! At every door, hark how they thundering call! Good lord! what can this giddy rout excite? Why, on each other with fell tooth to fall; A neighbour's fortune, fame, or peace, to blight, And make new tiresome parties for the coming night. LIV The puzzling sons of party next appear'd, In dark cabals and nightly juntos met; And now they whisper'd close, now shrugging rear'd The important shoulder; then, as if to get New light, their twinkling eyes were inward set. No sooner Lucifer The Morning star. recalls affairs, Than forth they various rush in mighty fret; When lo! push'd up to power, and crown'd their cares, In comes another set, and kicketh them down stairs. LV But what most show'd the vanity of life Was to behold the nations all on fire, In cruel broils engaged, and deadly strife: Most christian kings, inflamed by black desire, With honourable ruffians in their hire, Cause war to rage, and blood around to pour; Of this sad work when each begins to tire, Then sit them down just where they were before, Till for new scenes of woe peace shall their force restore. LVI To number up the thousands dwelling here, A useless were, and eke an endless task; From kings, and those who at the helm appear, To gipsies brown in summer-glades who bask. Yea many a man, perdie, I could unmask, Whose desk and table make a solemn show, With tape-tied trash, and suits of fools that ask For place or pension laid in decent row; But these I passen by, with nameless numbers moe. LVII Of all the gentle tenants of the place, There was a man of special grave remark; A certain tender gloom o'erspread his face, Pensive, not sad; in thought involved, not dark; As soot this man could sing as morning lark, And teach the noblest morals of the heart: But these his talents were yburied stark; Of the fine stores he nothing would impart, Which or boon nature gave, or nature-painting art. LVIII To noontide shades incontinent he ran, Where purls the brook with sleep-inviting sound; Or when Dan Sol to slope his wheels began, Amid the broom he bask'd him on the ground, Where the wild thyme and camomile are found: There would he linger, till the latest ray Of light sat trembling on the welkin's bound; Then homeward through the twilight shadows stray, Sauntering and slow. So had he passed many a day. LIX Yet not in thoughtless slumber were they past: For oft the heavenly fire, that lay conceal'd Beneath the sleeping embers, mounted fast, And all its native light anew reveal'd: Oft as he traversed the cerulean field, And mark'd the clouds that drove before the wind, Ten thousand glorious systems would he build, Ten thousand great ideas fill'd his mind; But with the clouds they fled, and left no trace behind. LX With him was sometimes join'd, in silent walk, (Profoundly silent, for they never spoke) One Conjecture has applied this to Dr. Armstrong, the poet. shyer still, who quite detested talk: Oft, stung by spleen, at once away he broke, To groves of pine, and broad o'ershadowing oak; There, inly thrill'd, he wander'd all alone, And on himself his pensive fury wroke, Ne ever utter'd word, save when first shone The glittering star of eveââThank heaven! the day is done.â LXI Here lurk'd a wretch, who had not crept abroad For forty years, ne face of mortal seen; In chamber brooding like a loathly toad: And sure his linen was not very clean. Through secret loop holes, that had practised been Near to his bed, his dinner vile he took; Unkempt, and rough, of squalid face and mien, Our Castle's shame! whence, from his filthy nook, We drove the villain out for fitter lair to look. LXII One day there chanced into these halls to rove A joyous youth, who took you at first sight; Him the wild wave of pleasure hither drove, Before the sprightly tempest tossing light: Certes, he was a most engaging wight, Of social glee, and wit humane though keen, Turning the night to day and day to night: For him the merry bells had rung, I ween, If in this nook of quiet bells had ever been. LXIII But not e'en pleasure to excess is good: What most elates, then sinks the soul as low: When springtide joy pours in with copious flood, The higher still the exulting billows flow, The further back again they flagging go, And leave us groveling on the dreary shore: Taught by this son of joy, we found it so; Who, whilst he staid, he kept in gay uproar Our madden'd castle all, the abode of sleep no more. LXIV As when in prime of June a burnish'd fly, Sprung from the meads, o'er which he sweeps along, Cheer'd by the breathing bloom and vital sky, Tunes up amid these airy halls his song, Soothing at first the gay reposing throng: And oft he sips their bowl; or nearly drown'd, He, thence recovering, drives their beds among, And scares their tender sleep, with trump profound; Then out again he flies, to wing his mazy round. LXV Another guest George, Lord Lyttelton. there was, of sense refined, Who felt each worth, for every worth he had; Serene yet warm, humane yet firm his mind, As little touch'd as any man's with bad: Him through their inmost walks the Muses lad, To him the sacred love of nature lent, And sometimes would he make our valley glad; Whenas we found he would not here be pent, To him the better sort this friendly message sent: LXVI âCome, dwell with us! true son of virtue, come! But if, alas! we cannot thee persuade To lie content beneath our peaceful dome, Ne ever more to quit our quiet glade; Yet when at last thy toils but ill apaid Shall dead thy fire, and damp its heavenly spark, Thou wilt be glad to seek the rural shade, There to indulge the muse, and nature mark: We then a lodge for thee will rear in Hagley Park.â LXVII Here whilom ligg'd the Esopus Mr. Quin. of the age; But call'd by fame, in soul ypricked deep, A noble pride restored him to the stage, And roused him like a giant from his sleep. Even from his slumbers we advantage reap: With double force the enliven'd scene he wakes, Yet quits not nature's bounds. He knows to keep Each due decorum: now the heart he shakes, And now with well urged sense the enlighten'd judgment takes. LXVIII A bard here dwelt, more fat than bard beseems; Who, The following lines of this stanza were writ by a friend of the author (since understood to have been Lord Lyttelton), and were designed to portray the character of Thomson. void of envy, guile, and lust of gain, On virtue still, and nature's pleasing themes, Pour'd forth his unpremeditated strain: The world forsaking with a calm disdain, Here laugh'd he careless in his easy seat; Here quaff'd, encircled with the joyous train, Oft moralizing sage: his ditty sweet He loathed much to write, ne cared to repeat. LXIX Full oft by holy feet our ground was trod, Of clerks good plenty here you mote espy. A little, round, fat, oily man The Rev. Mr. Murdoch, Thomson's friend and biographer. of God, Was one I chiefly mark'd among the fry: He had a roguish twinkle in his eye, And shone all glittering with ungodly dew, If a tight damsel chanced to trippen by; Which when observed, he shrunk into his mew, And straight would recollect his piety anew. LXX Nor be forgot a tribe, who minded nought (Old inmates of the place) but state-affairs: They look'd, perdie, as if they deeply thought; And on their brow sat every nation's cares; The world by them is parcel'd out in shares, When in the Hall of Smoke they congress hold, And the sage berry, sun-burnt Mocha bears, Has clear'd their inward eye: then, smoke-enroll'd, Their oracles break forth mysterious as of old. LXXI Here languid Beauty kept her pale-faced court: Bevies of dainty dames, of high degree, From every quarter hither made resort; Where, from gross mortal care and business free, They lay, pour'd out in ease and luxury. Or should they a vain shew of work assume, Alas! and well-a-day! what can it be? To knot, to twist, to range the vernal bloom; But far is cast the distaff, spinning-wheel, and loom. LXXII Their only labour was to kill the time; (And labour dire it is, and weary woe) They sit, they loll, turn o'er some idle rhyme; Then, rising sudden, to the glass they go, Or saunter forth, with tottering step and slow: This soon too rude an exercise they find; Straight on the couch their limbs again they throw, Where hours on hours they sighing lie reclined, And court the vapoury god, soft breathing in the wind. After this stanza, the following one was introduced, in the edition of 1746: One nymph there was, methought, in bloom of May, On whom the idle Fiend glanced many a look, In hopes to lead her down the slippery way To taste of Pleasure's deep deceitful brook: No virtues yet her gentle mind forsook: No idle whims, no vapours fill'd her brain, But Prudence for her youthful guide she took, And Goodness, which no earthly vice could stain, Dwelt in her mind; she was ne proud I ween or vain. LXXIII Now must I mark the villany we found, But ah! too late, as shall eftsoons be shown. A place here was, deep, dreary, under ground; Where still our inmates, when unpleasing grown, Diseased, and loathsome, privily were thrown: Far from the light of heaven, they languish'd there, Unpitied uttering many a bitter groan; For of these wretches taken was no care: Fierce fiends, and hags of hell, their only nurses were. LXXIV Alas! the change! from scenes of joy and rest, To this dark den, where sickness toss'd alway. Here Lethargy, with deadly sleep oppress'd, Stretch'd on his back, a mighty lubbard, lay, Heaving his sides, and snored night and day; To stir him from his traunce it was not eath, And his half-open'd eyne he shut straightway; He led, I wot, the softest way to death, And taught withouten pain and strife to yield the breath. LXXV Of limbs enormous, but withal unsound, Soft-swoln and pale, here lay the Hydropsy: Unwieldy man; with belly monstrous round, For ever fed with watery supply; For still he drank, and yet he still was dry. And moping here did Hypochondria sit, Mother of spleen, in robes of various dye, Who vexed was full oft with ugly fit; And some her frantic deem'd, and some her deem'd a wit. LXXVI A lady proud she was, of ancient blood, Yet oft her fear her pride made crouchen low: She felt, or fancied in her fluttering mood, All the diseases which the spittles know, And sought all physic which the shops bestow, And still new leaches and new drugs would try, Her humour ever wavering to and fro: For sometimes she would laugh, and sometimes cry, Then sudden waxed wroth, and all she knew not why. LXXVII Fast by her side a listless maiden pined, With aching head, and squeamish heart-burnings; Pale, bloated, cold, she seem'd to hate mankind, Yet loved in secret all forbidden things. And here the Tertian shakes his chilling wings; The sleepless Gout here counts the crowing cocks, A wolf now gnaws him, now a serpent stings; Whilst Apoplexy cramm'd Intemperance knocks Down to the ground at once, as butcher felleth ox. The four concluding stanzas were claimed by Doctor Armstrong, and inserted in his Miscellanies. CANTO II. The knight of arts and industry, And his achievements fair; That, by this Castle's overthrow, Secured, and crowned were. I Escaped the castle of the sire of sin, Ah! where shall I so sweet a dwelling find? For all around, without, and all within, Nothing save what delightful was and kind, Of goodness savouring and a tender mind, E'er rose to view. But now another strain, Of doleful note, alas! remains behind: I now must sing of pleasure turn'd to pain, And of the false enchanter Indolence complain. II Is there no patron to protect the Muse, And fence for her Parnassus' barren soil? To every labour its reward accrues, And they are sure of bread who swink and moil; But a fell tribe the Aonian hive despoil, As ruthless wasps oft rob the painful bee: Thus while the laws not guard that noblest toil, Ne for the Muses other meed decree, They praised are alone, and starve right merrily. III I care not, Fortune, what you me deny: You cannot rob me of free Nature's grace; You cannot shut the windows of the sky, Through which Aurora shows her brightening face; You cannot bar my constant feet to trace The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve: Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace, And I their toys to the great children leave: Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave. IV Come then, my Muse, and raise a bolder song; Come, lig no more upon the bed of sloth, Dragging the lazy languid line along, Fond to begin, but still to finish loath, Thy half-writ scrolls all eaten by the moth: Arise, and sing that generous imp of fame, Who with the sons of softness nobly wroth, To sweep away this human lumber came, Or in a chosen few to rouse the slumbering flame. V In Fairy Land there lived a knight of old, Of feature stern, Selvaggio well yclep'd, A rough unpolish'd man, robust and bold, But wondrous poor: he neither sow'd nor reap'd, Ne stores in summer for cold winter heap'd; In hunting all his days away he wore; Now scorch'd by June, now in November steep'd, Now pinch'd by biting January sore, He still in woods pursued the libbard and the boar. VI As he one morning, long before the dawn, Prick'd through the forest to dislodge his prey, Deep in the winding bosom of a lawn, With wood wild fringed, he mark'd a taper's ray, That from the beating rain, and wintry fray, Did to a lonely cot his steps decoy; There, up to earn the needments of the day, He found dame Poverty, nor fair nor coy: Her he compress'd, and fill'd her with a lusty boy. VII Amid the greenwood shade this boy was bred, And grew at last a knight of muchel fame, Of active mind and vigorous lustyhed, The Knight of Arts and Industry by name: Earth was his bed, the boughs his roof did frame; He knew no beverage but the flowing stream; His tasteful well earn'd food the sylvan game, Or the brown fruit with which the woodlands teem: The same to him glad summer, or the winter breme. VIII So pass'd his youthly morning, void of care, Wild as the colts that through the commons run: For him no tender parents troubled were, He of the forest seem'd to be the son, And, certes, had been utterly undone; But that Minerva pity of him took, With all the gods that love the rural wonne, That teach to tame the soil and rule the crook; Ne did the sacred Nine disdain a gentle look. IX Of fertile genius him they nurtured well, In every science, and in every art, By which mankind the thoughtless brutes excel, That can or use, or joy, or grace impart, Disclosing all the powers of head and heart: Ne were the goodly exercises spared, That brace the nerves, or make the limbs alert, And mix elastic force with firmness hard: Was never knight on ground mote be with him compared. X Sometimes, with early morn, he mounted gay The hunter steed, exulting o'er the dale, And drew the roseate breath of orient day; Sometimes, retiring to the secret vale, Yclad in steel, and bright with burnish'd mail, He strain'd the bow, or toss'd the sounding spear, Or darting on the goal, outstripp'd the gale, Or wheel'd the chariot in its mid career, Or strenuous wrestled hard with many a tough compeer. XI At other times he pried through nature's store, Whate'er she in the ethereal round contains, Whate'er she hides beneath her verdant floor, The vegetable and the mineral reigns; Or else he scann'd the globe, those small domains, Where restless mortals such a turmoil keep, Its seas, its floods, its mountains, and its plains; But more he search'd the mind, and roused from sleep Those moral seeds whence we heroic actions reap. XII Nor would he scorn to stoop from high pursuits Of heavenly truth, and practise what she taught: Vain is the tree of knowledge without fruits! Sometimes in hand the spade or plough he caught, Forth calling all with which boon earth is fraught; Sometimes he plied the strong mechanic tool, Or rear'd the fabric from the finest draught; And oft he put himself to Neptune's school, Fighting with winds and waves on the vex'd ocean pool. XIII To solace then these rougher toils, he tried To touch the kindling canvass into life; With nature his creating pencil vied, With nature joyous at the mimic strife: Or, to such shapes as graced Pygmalion's wife He hew'd the marble; or, with varied fire, He roused the trumpet, and the martial fife, Or bad the lute sweet tenderness inspire, Or verses framed that well might wake Apollo's lyre. XIV Accomplish'd thus, he from the woods issued, Full of great aims, and bent on bold emprise; The work, which long he in his breast had brew'd, Now to perform he ardent did devise; To wit, a barbarous world to civilize. Earth was till then a boundless forest wild; Nought to be seen but savage wood, and skies; No cities nourish'd arts, no culture smiled, No government, no laws, no gentle manners mild. XV A rugged wight, the worst of brutes, was man; On his own wretched kind he, ruthless, prey'd: The strongest still the weakest overran; In every country mighty robbers sway'd, And guile and ruffian force were all their trade. Life was a scene of rapine, want, and woe; Which this brave knight, in noble anger, made To swear he would the rascal rout o'erthrow, For, by the powers divine, it should no more be so! XVI It would exceed the purport of my song To say how this best sun, from orient climes, Came beaming life and beauty all along, Before him chasing indolence and crimes. Still as he pass'd, the nations he sublimes, And calls forth arts and virtues with his ray: Then Egypt, Greece, and Rome their golden times, Successive, had; but now in ruins grey They lie, to slavish sloth and tyranny a prey. XVII To crown his toils, Sir Industry then spread The swelling sail, and made for Britain's coast. A silvan life till then the natives led, In the brown shades and green-wood forest lost, All careless rambling where it liked them most: Their wealth the wild deer bouncing through the glade; They lodged at large, and lived at nature's cost; Save spear and bow, withouten other aid; Yet not the Roman steel their naked breast dismay'd. XVIII He liked the soil, he liked the clement skies, He liked the verdant hills and flowery plains: âBe this my great, my chosen isle, (he cries) This, whilst my labours Liberty sustains, This queen of ocean all assault disdains.â Nor liked he less the genius of the land, To freedom apt and persevering pains, Mild to obey, and generous to command, Temper'd by forming Heaven with kindest firmest hand. XIX Here, by degrees, his master-work arose, Whatever arts and industry can frame: Whatever finish'd agriculture knows, Fair queen of arts! from heaven itself who came, When Eden flourish'd in unspotted fame; And still with her sweet innocence we find, And tender peace, and joys without a name, That, while they ravish, tranquillize the mind: Nature and art at once, delight and use combined. XX Then towns he quicken'd by mechanic arts, And bade the fervent city glow with toil; Bade social commerce raise renowned marts, Join land to land, and marry soil to soil; Unite the poles, and without bloody spoil Bring home of either Ind the gorgeous stores; Or, should despotic rage the world embroil, Bade tyrants tremble on remotest shores, While o'er the encircling deep Britannia's thunder roars. XXI The drooping muses then he westward call'd, From the famed city Constantinople. by Propontic sea, What time the Turk the enfeebled Grecian thrall'd; Thence from their cloister'd walks he set them free, And brought them to another Castalie, Where Isis many a famous nursling breeds; Or where old Cam soft-paces o'er the lea In pensive mood, and tunes his doric reeds, The whilst his flocks at large the lonely shepherd feeds. XXII Yet the fine arts were what he finished least. For why? They are the quintessence of all, The growth of labouring time, and slow increased; Unless, as seldom chances, it should fall That mighty patrons the coy sisters call Up to the sunshine of uncumber'd ease, Where no rude care the mounting thought may thrall, And where they nothing have to do but please: Ah! gracious God! thou know'st they ask no other fees. XXIII But now, alas! we live too late in time: Our patrons now e'en grudge that little claim, Except to such as sleek the soothing rhyme; And yet, forsooth, they wear MÃ¦cenas' name, Poor sons of puft-up vanity, not fame. Unbroken spirits, cheer! still, still remains The eternal patron, Liberty; whose flame, While she protects, inspires the noblest strains: The best and sweetest far, are toil-created gains. XXIV When as the knight had framed, in Britain-land, A matchless form of glorious government, In which the sovereign laws alone command, Laws stablish'd by the public free consent, Whose majesty is to the sceptre lent; When this great plan, with each dependent art, Was settled firm, and to his heart's content, Then sought he from the toilsome scene to part, And let life's vacant eve breathe quiet through the heart. XXV For this he chose a farm in Deva's vale, Where his long alleys peep'd upon the main: In this calm seat he drew the healthful gale, Here mix'd the chief, the patriot, and the swain. The happy monarch of his silvan train, Here, sided by the guardians of the fold, He walk'd his rounds, and cheer'd his blest domain: His days, the days of unstain'd nature, roll'd Replete with peace and joy, like patriarchs of old. XXVI Witness, ye lowing herds, who gave him milk; Witness, ye flocks, whose woolly vestments far Exceed soft India's cotton, or her silk; Witness, with Autumn charged the nodding car, That homeward came beneath sweet evening's star, Or of September-moons the radiance mild. O hide thy head, abominable war! Of crimes and ruffian idleness the child! From Heaven this life ysprung, from hell thy glories viled! XXVII Nor from his deep retirement banish'd was The amusing care of rural industry. Still, as with grateful change the seasons pass, New scenes arise, new landscapes strike the eye, And all the enlivened country beautify: Gay plains extend where marshes slept before; O'er recent meads the exulting streamlets fly; Dark frowning heaths grow bright with Ceres' store, And woods imbrown the steep, or wave along the shore. XXVIII As nearer to his farm you made approach, He polish'd Nature with a finer hand: Yet on her beauties durst not art encroach; 'Tis Art's alone these beauties to expand. In graceful dance immingled, o'er the land, Pan, Pales, Flora, and Pomona play'd: Here, too, brisk gales the rude wild common fann'd, A happy place; where free, and unafraid, Amid the flowering brakes each coyer creature stray'd. XXIX But in prime vigour what can last for aye? That soul-enfeebling wizard Indolence, I whilom sung, wrought in his works decay: Spread far and wide was his cursed influence; Of public virtue much he dull'd the sense, E'en much of private; eat our spirit out, And fed our rank luxurious vices: whence The land was overlaid with many a lout; Not, as old fame reports, wise, generous, bold, and stout. XXX A rage of pleasure madden'd every breast, Down to the lowest lees the ferment ran: To his licentious wish each must be bless'd, With joy be fever'd; snatch it as he can. Thus Vice the standard rear'd; her arrier-ban Corruption call'd, and loud she gave the word, âMind, mind yourselves! why should the vulgar man, The lacquey be more virtuous than his lord? Enjoy this span of life! 'tis all the gods afford.â XXXI The tidings reach'd to where, in quiet hall, The good old knight enjoy'd well earn'd repose: âCome, come, Sir Knight! thy children on thee call; Come, save us yet, ere ruin round us close! The demon Indolence thy toils o'erthrows.â On this the noble colour stain'd his cheeks, Indignant, glowing through the whitening snows Of venerable eld; his eye full speaks His ardent soul, and from his couch at once he breaks. XXXII âI will, (he cried) so help me, God! destroy That villain Archimage.ââHis page then straight He to him call'd; a fiery-footed boy, Benempt Dispatch:ââMy steed be at the gate; My bard attend; quick, bring the net of fate.â This net was twisted by the sisters three; Which, when once cast o'er harden'd wretch, too late Repentance comes: replevy cannot be From the strong iron grasp of vengeful destiny. XXXIII He came, the bard, a little druid wight, Of wither'd aspect; but his eye was keen, With sweetness mix'd. In russet brown bedight, As is his sister The Nightingale. of the copses green, He crept along, unpromising of mien. Gross he who judges so. His soul was fair, Bright as the children of yon azure sheen! True comeliness, which nothing can impair, Dwells in the mind: all else is vanity and glare. XXXIV âCome (quoth the knight), a voice has reach'd mine ear: The demon Indolence threats overflow To all that to mankind is good and dear: Come, Philomelus; let us instant go, O'erturn his bowers, and lay his castle low. Those men, those wretched men! who will be slaves, Must drink a bitter wrathful cup of woe: But some there be, thy song, as from their graves, Shall raise.â Thrice happy he! who without rigour saves. XXXV Issuing forth, the knight bestrode his steed, Of ardent bay, and on whose front a star Shone blazing bright: sprung from the generous breed, That whirl of active day the rapid car, He pranced along, disdaining gate or bar. Meantime, the bard on milk-white palfrey rode; An honest sober beast, that did not mar His meditations, but full softly trode: And much they moralized as thus yfere they yode. XXXVI They talk'd of virtue, and of human bliss. What else so fit for man to settle well? And still their long researches met in this, This Truth of Truths, which nothing can refel: âFrom virtue's fount the purest joys outwell, Sweet rills of thought that cheer the conscious soul; While vice pours forth the troubled streams of hell, The which, howe'er disguised, at last with dole Will through the tortured breast their fiery torrent roll.â XXXVII At length it dawn'd, that fatal valley gay, O'er which high wood-crown'd hills their summits rear: On the cool height awhile our palmers stay, And spite even of themselves their senses cheer; Then to the vizard's wonne their steps they steer. Like a green isle, it broad beneath them spread, With gardens round, and wandering currents clear, And tufted groves to shade the meadow-bed, Sweet airs and song; and without hurry all seem'd glad. XXXVIII âAs God shall judge me, knight! we must forgive (The half-enraptured Philomelus cried) The frail good man deluded here to live, And in these groves his musing fancy hide. Ah! nought is pure. It cannot be denied, That virtue still some tincture has of vice, And vice of virtue. What should then betide, But that our charity be not too nice? Come, let us those we can, to real bliss entice.â XXXIX âAy, sicker, (quoth the knight) all flesh is frail, To pleasant sin and joyous dalliance bent; But let not brutish vice of this avail, And think to 'scape deserved punishment. Justice were cruel weakly to relent; From Mercy's self she got her sacred glaive: Grace be to those who can, and will, repent; But penance long, and dreary, to the slave, Who must in floods of fire his gross foul spirit lave.â XL Thus, holding high discourse, they came to where The cursed carle was at his wonted trade; Still tempting heedless men into his snare, In witching wise, as I before have said. But when he saw, in goodly geer array'd, The grave majestic knight approaching nigh, And by his side the bard so sage and staid, His countenance fell; yet oft his anxious eye Mark'd them, like wily fox who roosted cock doth spy. XLI Nathless, with feign'd respect, he bade give back The rabble rout, and welcomed them full kind; Struck with the noble twain, they were not slack His orders to obey, and fall behind. Then he resumed his song; and unconfined, Pour'd all his music, ran through all his strings: With magic dust their eyne he tries to blind, And virtue's tender airs o'er weakness flings. What pity base his song who so divinely sings! XLII Elate in thought, he counted them his own, They listen'd so intent with fix'd delight: But they instead, as if transmew'd to stone, Marvel'd he could with such sweet art unite The lights and shades of manners, wrong and right. Meantime, the silly crowd the charm devour, Wide pressing to the gate. Swift, on the knight He darted fierce, to drag him to his bower, Who backening shunn'd his touch, for well he knew its power. XLIII As in throng'd amphitheatre, of old, The wary Retiarius A gladiator, who made use of a net, which he threw over his adversary. trapp'd his foe; E'en so the knight, returning on him bold, At once involved him in the Net of Woe, Whereof I mention made not long ago. Inraged at first, he scorn'd so weak a jail, And leap'd, and flew, and flounced to and fro; But when he found that nothing could avail, He sat him felly down, and gnaw'd his bitter nail. XLIV Alarm'd, the inferior demons of the place Raised rueful shrieks and hideous yells around; Black stormy clouds deform'd the welkin's face, And from beneath was heard a wailing sound, As of infernal sprights in cavern bound; A solemn sadness every creature strook, And lightnings flash'd, and horror rock'd the ground: Huge crowds on crowds outpour'd, with blemish'd look, As if on Time's last verge this frame of things had shook. XLV Soon as the short-lived tempest was yspent, Steam'd from the jaws of vex'd Avernus' hole, And hush'd the hubbub of the rabblement, Sir Industry the first calm moment stole: âThere must, (he cried) amid so vast a shoal, Be some who are not tainted at the heart, Not poison'd quite by this same villain's bowl: Come then, my bard, thy heavenly fire impart; Touch soul with soul, till forth the latent spirit start.â XLVI The bard obey'd; and taking from his side, Where it in seemly sort depending hung, His British harp, its speaking strings he tried, The which with skilful touch he deftly strung, Till tinkling in clear symphony they rung. Then, as he felt the Muses come along, Light o'er the chords his raptured hand he flung, And play'd a prelude to his rising song: The whilst, like midnight mute, ten thousands round him throng. XLVII Thus, ardent, burst his strain.ââYe hapless race, Dire labouring here to smother reason's ray, That lights our Maker's image in our face, And gives us wide o'er earth unquestion'd sway; What is the adored Supreme Perfection, say?â What, but eternal never resting soul, Almighty Power, and all-directing day; By whom each atom stirs, the planets roll; Who fills, surrounds, informs, and agitates the whole. XLVIII âCome, to the beaming God your hearts unfold! Draw from its fountain life! 'Tis thence, alone, We can excel. Up from unfeeling mould, To seraphs burning round the Almighty's throne, Life rising still on life, in higher tone, Perfection forms, and with perfection bliss. In universal nature this clear shown, Not needeth proof: to prove it were, I wis, To prove the beauteous world excels the brute abyss. XLIX âIs not the field, with lively culture green, A sight more joyous than the dead morass? Do not the skies, with active ether clean, And fann'd by sprightly zephyrs, far surpass The foul November fogs, and slumbrous mass With which sad Nature veils her drooping face? Does not the mountain stream, as clear as glass, Gay-dancing on, the putrid pool disgrace? The same in all holds true, but chief in human race. L âIt was not by vile loitering in ease, That Greece obtain'd the brighter palm of art; That soft yet ardent Athens learn'd to please, To keen the wit, and to sublime the heart, In all supreme! complete in every part! It was not thence majestic Rome arose, And o'er the nations shook her conquering dart: For sluggard's brow the laurel never grows; Renown is not the child of indolent Repose. LI âHad unambitious mortals minded nought, But in loose joy their time to wear away; Had they alone the lap of dalliance sought, Pleased on her pillow their dull heads to lay, Rude nature's state had been our state to-day; No cities e'er their towery fronts had raised, No arts had made us opulent and gay; With brother-brutes the human race had grazed; None e'er had soar'd to fame, none honour'd been, none praised. LII âGreat Homer's song had never fired the breast To thirst of glory, and heroic deeds; Sweet Maro's muse, sunk in inglorious rest, Had silent slept amid the Mincian reeds: The wits of modern time had told their beads, And monkish legends been their only strains; Our Milton's Eden had lain wrapt in weeds, Our Shakespeare stroll'd and laugh'd with Warwick swains, Ne had my master Spenser charm'd his Mulla's plains. LIII âDumb too had been the sage historic muse, And perish'd all the sons of ancient fame; Those starry lights of virtue, that diffuse Through the dark depth of time their vivid flame, Had all been lost with such as have no name. Who then had scorn'd his ease for others' good? Who then had toil'd rapacious men to tame? Who in the public breach devoted stood, And for his country's cause been prodigal of blood? LIV âBut should to fame your hearts unfeeling be, If right I read, you pleasure all require: Then hear how best may be obtain'd this fee, How best enjoy'd this nature's wide desire. Toil and be glad! let industry inspire Into your quicken'd limbs her buoyant breath! Who does not act is dead; absorpt entire In miry sloth, no pride, no joy he hath: O leaden-hearted men, to be in love with death! LV âAh! what avail the largest gifts of Heaven, When drooping health and spirits go amiss? How tasteless then whatever can be given? Health is the vital principle of bliss, And exercise of health. In proof of this, Behold the wretch, who slugs his life away, Soon swallow'd in disease's sad abyss; While he whom toil has braced, or manly play, Has light as air each limb, each thought as clear as day. LVI âO who can speak the vigorous joys of health! Unclogg'd the body, unobscured the mind: The morning rises gay, with pleasing stealth, The temperate evening falls serene and kind. In health the wiser brutes true gladness find: See! how the younglings frisk along the meads, As May comes on, and wakes the balmy wind; Rampant with life, their joy all joy exceeds: Yet what but high-strung health this dancing pleasaunce breeds? LVII âBut here, instead, is foster'd every ill, Which or distemper'd minds or bodies know. Come then, my kindred spirits! do not spill Your talents here: this place is but a show, Whose charms delude you to the den of woe. Come, follow me, I will direct you right, Where pleasure's roses, void of serpents, grow, Sincere as sweet; come, follow this good knight, And you will bless the day that brought him to your sight. LVIII âSome he will lead to courts, and some to camps; To senates some, and public sage debates, Where, by the solemn gleam of midnight lamps, The world is poised, and managed mighty states; To high discovery some, that new creates The face of earth; some to the thriving mart; Some to the rural reign, and softer fates; To the sweet muses some, who raise the heart: All glory shall be yours, all nature, and all art! LIX âThere are, I see, who listen to my lay, Who wretched sigh for virtue, but despair: âAll may be done, (methinks I hear them say) E'en death despised by generous actions fair; All, but for those who to these bowers repair, Their every power dissolved in luxury, To quit of torpid sluggishness the lair, And from the powerful arms of sloth get free: 'Tis rising from the deadâAlas!âit cannot be!â LX âWould you then learn to dissipate the band Of the huge threatening difficulties dire, That in the weak man's way like lions stand, His soul appal, and damp his rising fire? Resolve, resolve, and to be men aspire. Exert that noblest privilege, alone, Here to mankind indulged; control desire: Let godlike reason, from her sovereign throne, Speak the commanding word âI will!â and it is done. LXI âHeavens! can you then thus waste, in shameful wise, Your few important days of trial here? Heirs of eternity! yborn to rise Through endless states of being, still more near To bliss approaching, and perfection clear; Can you renounce a fortune so sublime, Such glorious hopes, your backward steps to steer, And roll, with vilest brutes, through mud and slime? No! no!âYour heaven-touch'd hearts disdain the sordid crime!â LXII âEnough! enough!â they criedâstraight, from the crowd, The better sort on wings of transport fly: As when amid the lifeless summits proud Of Alpine cliffs where to the gelid sky Snows piled on snows in wintry torpor lie, The rays divine of vernal PhÅbus play; The awaken'd heaps, in streamlets from on high, Roused into action, lively leap away, Glad warbling through the vales, in their new being gay, LXIII Not less the life, the vivid joy serene, That lighted up these new created men, Than that which wings the exulting spirit clean, When, just deliver'd from this fleshly den, It soaring seeks its native skies agen: How light its essence! how unclogg'd its powers, Beyond the blazon of my mortal pen! E'en so we glad forsook these sinful bowers, E'en such enraptured life, such energy was ours. LXIV But far the greater part, with rage inflamed, Dire-mutter'd curses, and blasphemed high Jove: âYe sons of hate! (they bitterly exclaim'd) What brought you to this seat of peace and love? While with kind nature, here amid the grove, We pass'd the harmless sabbath of our time, What to disturb it could, fell men, emove Your barbarous hearts? Is happiness a crime? Then do the fiends of hell rule in yon Heaven sublime.â LXV âYe impious wretches, (quoth the knight in wrath) Your happiness behold!ââThen straight a wand He waved, an anti-magic power that hath, Truth from illusive falsehood to command. Sudden the landscape sinks on every hand; The pure quick streams are marshy puddles found; On baleful heaths the groves all blacken'd stand; And o'er the weedy foul abhorred ground, Snakes, adders, toads, each loathsome creature crawls around. LXVI And here and there, on trees by lightning scathed, Unhappy wights who loathed life yhung; Or, in fresh gore and recent murder bathed, They weltering lay; or else, infuriate flung Into the gloomy flood, while ravens sung The funeral dirge, they down the torrent roll'd: These, by distemper'd blood to madness stung, Had doom'd themselves; whence oft, when night control'd The world, returning hither their sad spirits howl'd. LXVII Meantime a moving scene was open laid; That lazar-house, I whilom in my lay Depainted have, its horrors deep display'd, And gave unnumber'd wretches to the day, Who tossing there in squalid misery lay. Soon as of sacred light the unwonted smile Pour'd on these living catacombs its ray, Through the drear caverns stretching many a mile, The sick upraised their heads, and dropp'd their woes awhile. LXVIII âO Heaven! (they cried) and do we once more see Yon blessed sun, and this green earth so fair? Are we from noisome damps of pesthouse free? And drink our souls the sweet ethereal air? O thou! or Knight, or God? who holdest there That fiend, oh keep him in eternal chains! But what for us, the children of despair, Brought to the brink of hell, what hope remains? Repentance does itself but aggravate our pains. LXIX The gentle Knight, who saw their rueful case, Let fall adown his silver beard some tears. âCertes (quoth he) it is not e'en in grace, To undo the past, and eke your broken years: Nathless, to nobler worlds repentance rears, With humble hope, her eye; to her is given A power the truly contrite heart that cheers; She quells the brand by which the rocks are riven; She more than merely softens, she rejoices Heaven. LXX âThen patient bear the sufferings you have earn'd, And by these sufferings purify the mind; Let wisdom be by past misconduct learn'd: Or pious die, with penitence resign'd; And to a life more happy and refined, Doubt not, you shall, new creatures, yet arise. Till then, you may expect in me to find One who will wipe your sorrow from your eyes, One who will soothe your pangs, and wing you to the skies.â LXXI They silent heard, and pour'd their thanks in tears: âFor you (resumed the Knight with sterner tone) Whose hard dry hearts the obdurate demon sears, That villain's gifts will cost you many a groan; In dolorous mansion long you must bemoan His fatal charms, and weep your stains away; Till, soft and pure as infant goodness grown, You feel a perfect change: then, who can say What grace may yet shine forth in Heaven's eternal day?â LXXII This said, his powerful wand he waved anew: Instant, a glorious angel-train descends, The Charities, to wit, of rosy hue; Sweet love their looks a gentle radiance lends, And with seraphic flame compassion blends. At once, delighted, to their charge they fly: When lo! a goodly hospital ascends; In which they bade each lenient aid be nigh, That could the sick-bed smooth of that sad company. LXXIII It was a worthy edifying sight, And gives to human kind peculiar grace, To see kind hands attending day and night, With tender ministry, from place to place. Some prop the head; some, from the pallid face Wipe off the faint cold dews weak nature sheds; Some reach the healing draught: the whilst, to chase The fear supreme, around their soften'd beds, Some holy man by prayer all opening Heaven dispreds. LXXIV Attended by a glad acclaiming train, Of those he rescued had from gaping hell, Then turn'd the Knight; and, to his hall again Soft-pacing, sought of peace the mossy cell: Yet down his cheeks the gems of pity fell, To see the helpless wretches that remain'd, There left through delves and deserts dire to yell; Amazed, their looks with pale dismay were stain'd, And spreading wide their hands they meek repentance feigned. LXXV But ah! their scorned day of grace was past: For (horrible to tell!) a desert wild Before them stretch'd, bare, comfortless, and vast; With gibbets, bones, and carcasses defiled. There nor trim field, nor lively culture smiled; Nor waving shade was seen, nor fountain fair; But sands abrupt on sands lay loosely piled, Through which they floundering toil'd with painful care, Whilst PhÅbus smote them sore, and fired the cloudless air. LXXVI Then, varying to a joyless land of bogs, The sadden'd country a grey waste appear'd; Where nought but putrid streams and noisome fogs For ever hung on drizzly Auster's beard; Or else the ground, by piercing Caurus sear'd, Was jagg'd with frost, or heap'd with glazed snow; Through these extremes a ceaseless round they steer'd, By cruel fiends still hurried to and fro, Gaunt Beggary, and Scorn, with many hell-hounds moe. LXXVII The first was with base dunghill rags yclad, Tainting the gale, in which they flutter'd light; Of morbid hue his features, sunk and sad; His hollow eyne shook forth a sickly light; And o'er his lank jawbone, in piteous plight, His black rough beard was matted rank and vile; Direful to see! a heart-appalling sight! Meantime foul scurf and blotches him defile; And dogs, where'er he went, still barked all the while. LXXVIII The other was a fell despightful fiend; Hell holds none worse in baleful bower below: By pride, and wit, and rage, and rancour, keen'd; Of man alike, if good or bad, the foe: With nose upturn'd, he always made a show As if he smelt some nauseous scent; his eye Was cold, and keen, like blast from boreal snow; And taunts he casten forth most bitterly. Such were the twain that off drove this ungodly fry. LXXIX E'en so through Brentford town, a town of mud, A herd of bristly swine is prick'd along; The filthy beasts, that never chew the cud, Still grunt, and squeak, and sing their troublous song, And oft they plunge themselves the mire among: But aye the ruthless driver goads them on, And aye of barking dogs the bitter throng Makes them renew their unmelodious moan; Ne ever find they rest from their unresting fone. BRITANNIA. ? Et tantas audetis tollere moles? Quos egoâsed motos prÃ¦stat componere fluctus. Post mihi non simili pÅna commissa luetis. Maturate fugam, regique hÃ¦c dicite vestro: Non illi imperium pelagi, sÃ¦vumque tridentem, Sed mihi sorte datum.? VIRGIL. As on the sea-beat shore Britannia sat, Of her degenerate sons the faded fame, Deep in her anxious heart, revolving sad: Bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale, That, hoarse and hollow, from the bleak surge blew; Loose flow'd her tresses; rent her azure robe. Hung o'er the deep from her majestic brow She tore the laurel, and she tore the bay. Nor ceased the copious grief to bathe her cheek; Nor ceased her sobs to murmur to the main. Peace discontented nigh, departing, stretch'd Her dove-like wings: and War, though greatly roused, Yet mourns his fetter'd hands. While thus the queen Of nations spoke; and what she said the muse Recorded, faithful, in unbidden verse. âE'en not yon sail, that, from the sky-mixt wave, Dawns on the sight, and wafts the Royal Youth, Frederick Prince of Wales, then lately arrived. A freight of future glory to my shore; E'en not the flattering view of golden days, And rising periods yet of bright renown, Beneath the Parents, and their endless line Through late revolving time, can soothe my rage; While, unchastised, the insulting Spaniard dares Infest the trading flood, full of vain war Despise my navies, and my merchants seize; As, trusting to false peace, they fearless roam The world of waters wild; made, by the toil, And liberal blood of glorious ages, mine: Nor bursts my sleeping thunder on their head. Whence this unwonted patience? this weak doubt? This tame beseeching of rejected peace? This meek forbearance? this unnative fear, To generous Britons never known before? And sail'd my fleets for this; on Indian tides To float, inactive, with the veering winds? The mockery of war! while hot disease, And sloth distemper'd, swept off burning crowds, For action ardent; and amid the deep, Inglorious, sunk them in a watery grave. There now they lie beneath the rolling flood, Far from their friends, and country, unavenged; And back the drooping war ship comes again, Dispirited and thin; her sons ashamed Thus idly to review their native shore; With not one glory sparkling in their eye, One triumph on their tongue. A passenger, The violated merchant comes along; That far sought wealth, for which the noxious gale He drew, and sweat beneath equator suns, By lawless force detain'd; a force that soon Would melt away, and every spoil resign, Were once the British lion heard to roar. Whence is it that the proud Iberian thus, In their own well asserted element, Dares rouse to wrath the masters of the main? Who told him, that the big incumbent war Would not, ere this, have roll'd his trembling ports In smoky ruin? and his guilty stores, Won by the ravage of a butcher'd world, Yet unattoned, sunk in the swallowing deep, Or led the glittering prize into the Thames? âThere was a time (Oh let my languid sons Resume their spirit at the rousing thought!) When all the pride of Spain, in one dread fleet, Swell'd o'er the labouring surge; like a whole heaven Of clouds, wide roll'd before the boundless breeze. Gaily the splendid armament along Exultant plough'd, reflecting a red gleam, As sunk the sun, o'er all the flaming Vast; Tall, gorgeous, and elate; drunk with the dream Of easy conquest; while their bloated war, Stretch'd out from sky to sky, the gather'd force Of ages held in its capacious womb. But soon, regardless of the cumbrous pomp, My dauntless Britons came, a gloomy few, With tempests black, the goodly scene deform'd, And laid their glory waste. The bolts of fate Resistless thunder'd through their yielding sides; Fierce o'er their beauty blazed the lurid flame; And seized in horrid grasp, or shatter'd wide, Amid the mighty waters, deep they sunk. Then too from every promontory chill, Rank fen, and cavern where the wild wave works, I swept confederate winds, and swell'd a storm. Round the glad isle, snatch'd by the vengeful blast, The scatter'd remnants drove; on the blind shelve, And pointed rock, that marks the indented shore, Relentless dash'd, where loud the northern main Howls through the fractured Caledonian isles. âSuch were the dawnings of my watery reign; But since how vast it grew, how absolute, E'en in those troubled times, when dreadful Blake Awed angry nations with the British name, Let every humbled state, let Europe say, Sustain'd, and balanced, by my naval arm. Ah, what must those immortal spirits think Of your poor shifts? Those, for their country's good, Who faced the blackest danger, knew no fear, No mean submission, but commanded peace. Ah, how with indignation must they burn? (If aught, but joy, can touch ethereal breasts) With shame? with grief? to see their feeble sons Shrink from that empire o'er the conquer'd seas, For which their wisdom plann'd, their councils glow'd, And their veins bled through many a toiling age. âOh, first of human blessings! and supreme! Fair Peace! how lovely, how delightful thou! By whose wide tie the kindred sons of men Like brothers live, in amity combined And unsuspicious faith; while honest toil Gives every joy, and to those joys a right, Which idle, barbarous rapine but usurps. Pure is thy reign; when, unaccursed by blood, Nought, save the sweetness of indulgent showers, Trickling distils into the vernant glebe; Instead of mangled carcasses, sad-seen, When the blithe sheaves lie scatter'd o'er the field; When only shining shares, the crooked knife, And hooks imprint the vegetable wound; When the land blushes with the rose alone, The falling fruitage and the bleeding vine. Oh, Peace! thou source and soul of social life; Beneath whose calm inspiring influence, Science his views enlarges, Art refines, And swelling Commerce opens all her ports; Bless'd be the man divine who gives us thee! Who bids the trumpet hush his horrid clang, Nor blow the giddy nations into rage; Who sheaths the murderous blade; the deadly gun Into the well piled armory returns; And every vigour, from the work of death, To grateful industry converting, makes The country flourish, and the city smile. Unviolated, him the virgin sings; And him the smiling mother to her train. Of him the shepherd, in the peaceful dale, Chants; and, the treasures of his labour sure, The husbandman of him, as at the plough, Or team, he toils. With him the sailor soothes, Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave; And the full city, warm, from street to street, And shop to shop, responsive, rings of him. Nor joys one land alone: his praise extends Far as the sun rolls the diffusive day; Far as the breeze can bear the gifts of peace, Till all the happy nations catch the song. âWhat would not, Peace! the patriot bear for thee? What painful patience What incessant care? What mix'd anxiety? What sleepless toil? E'en from the rash protected what reproach? For he thy value knows; thy friendship he To human nature: but the better thou, The richer of delight, sometimes the more Inevitable war; when ruffian force Awakes the fury of an injured state. E'en the good patient man, whom reason rules, Roused by bold insult, and injurious rage, With sharp and sudden check the astonish'd sons Of violence confounds; firm as his cause, His bolder heart; in awful justice clad; His eyes effulging a peculiar fire: And, as he charges through the prostrate war, His keen arm teaches faithless men, no more To dare the sacred vengeance of the just. âAnd what, my thoughtless sons, should fire you more Than when your well earn'd empire of the deep The least beginning injury receives? What better cause can call your lightning forth? Your thunder wake? your dearest life demand? What better cause, than when your country sees The sly destruction at her vitals aim'd? For oh! it much imports you, 'tis your all, To keep your trade entire, entire the force And honour of your fleets; o'er that to watch, E'en with a hand severe, and jealous eye. In intercourse be gentle, generous, just, By wisdom polish'd, and of manners fair; But on the sea be terrible, untamed, Unconquerable still: let none escape, Who shall but aim to touch your glory there. Is there the man into the lion's den Who dares intrude, to snatch his young away? And is a Briton seized? and seized beneath The slumbering terrors of a British fleet? Then ardent rise! Oh, great in vengeance rise! O'erturn the proud, teach rapine to restore: And as you ride sublimely round the world, Make every vessel stoop, make every state At once their welfare and their duty know. This is your glory: this your wisdom; this The native power for which you were design'd By fate, when fate design'd the firmest state, That e'er was seated on the subject sea; A state, alone, where Liberty should live, In these late times, this evening of mankind, When Athens, Rome, and Carthage are no more, The world almost in slavish sloth dissolved. For this, these rocks around your coast were thrown; For this, your oaks, peculiar harden'd, shoot Strong into sturdy growth; for this, your hearts Swell with a sullen courage, growing still As danger grows; and strength, and toil for this Are liberal pour'd o'er all the fervent land. Then cherish this, this unexpensive power, Undangerous to the public, ever prompt, By lavish nature thrust into your hand: And, unencumber'd with the bulk immense Of conquest, whence huge empires rose, and fell Self-crush'd, extend your reign from shore to shore, Where'er the wind your high behests can blow; And fix it deep on this eternal base. For should the sliding fabric once give way, Soon slacken'd quite, and past recovery broke, It gathers ruin as it rolls along, Steep rushing down to that devouring gulf, Where many a mighty empire buried lies. And should the big redundant flood of trade, In which ten thousand thousand labours join Their several currents, till the boundless tide Rolls in a radiant deluge o'er the land; Should this bright stream, the least inflected, point Its course another way, o'er other lands The various treasure would resistless pour, Ne'er to be won again; its ancient tract Left a vile channel, desolate, and dead, With all around a miserable waste. Not Egypt, were her better heaven, the Nile, Turn'd in the pride of flow; when o'er his rocks, And roaring cataracts, beyond the reach Of dizzy vision piled, in one wide flash An Ethiopian deluge foams amain; (Whence wondering fable traced him from the sky) E'en not that prime of earth, where harvests crowd On untill'd harvests, all the teeming year, If of the fat o'erflowing culture robb'd, Were then a more uncomfortable wild, Steril, and void; than of her trade deprived, Britons, your boasted isle: her princes sunk; Her high built honour moulder'd to the dust; Unnerved her force; her spirit vanish'd quite; With rapid wing her riches fled away; Her unfrequented ports alone the sign Of what she was; her merchants scatter'd wide; Her hollow shops shut up; and in her streets, Her fields, woods, markets, villages, and roads, The cheerful voice of labour heard no more. âOh, let not then waste luxury impair That manly soul of toil which strings your nerves, And your own proper happiness creates! Oh, let not the soft, penetrating plague Creep on the freeborn mind! and working there, With the sharp tooth of many a new-form'd want, Endless, and idle all, eat out the heart Of liberty; the high conception blast; The noble sentiment, the impatient scorn Of base subjection, and the swelling wish For general good, erasing from the mind: While nought save narrow selfishness succeeds, And low design, the sneaking passions all Let loose, and reigning in the rankled breast. Induced at last, by scarce perceived degrees, Sapping the very frame of government, And life, a total dissolution comes; Sloth, ignorance, dejection, flattery, fear. Oppression raging o'er the waste he makes; The human being almost quite extinct; And the whole state in broad corruption sinks. Oh, shun that gulf: that gaping ruin shun! And countless ages roll it far away From you, ye heaven-beloved! May liberty, The light of life! the sun of humankind! Whence heroes, bards, and patriots borrow flame, E'en where the keen depressive north descends, Still spread, exalt, and actuate your powers! While slavish southern climates beam in vain. And may a public spirit from the throne, Where every virtue sits, go copious forth, Live o'er the land! the finer arts inspire; Make thoughtful Science raise his pensive head, Blow the fresh bay, bid Industry rejoice, And the rough sons of lowest labour smile. As when, profuse of Spring, the loosen'd West Lifts up the pining year, and balmy breathes Youth, life, and love, and beauty, o'er the world. âBut haste we from these melancholy shores, Nor to deaf winds, and waves, our fruitless plaint Pour weak; the country claims our active aid; That let us roam; and where we find a spark Of public virtue, blow it into flame. Lo! now, my sons, the sons of freedom! meet In awful senate; thither let us fly; Burn in the patriot's thought, flow from his tongue In fearless truth; myself, transform'd, preside, And shed the spirit of Britannia round.â This said; her fleeting form and airy train Sunk in the gale; and nought but ragged rocks Rush'd on the broken eye; and nought was heard But the rough cadence of the dashing wave. LIBERTY. PART I. ANCIENT AND MODERN ITALY COMPARED TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK, PRINCE OF WALES.. CONTENTS. The following Poem is thrown into the form of a Poetical Vision. Its scene, the ruins of ancient Rome. The Goddess of Liberty, who is supposed to speak through the whole, appears, characterized as British Liberty. Gives a view of ancient Italy, and particularly of republican Rome, in all her magnificence and glory. This contrasted by modern Italy; its valleys, mountains, culture, cities, people: the difference appearing strongest in the capital city Rome. The ruins of the great works of Liberty more magnificent than the borrowed pomp of Oppression; and from them revived Sculpture, Painting, and Architecture. The old Romans apostrophized, with regard to the several melancholy changes in Italy: Horace, Tully, and Virgil, with regard to their Tibur, Tusculum, and Naples. That once finest and most ornamented part of Italy, all along the coast of BaiÃ¦, how changed. This desolation of Italy applied to Britain. Address to the Goddess of Liberty, that she would deduce from the first ages, her chief establishments, the description of which constitute the subject of the following parts of this Poem. She assents, and commands what she says to be sung in Britain; whose happiness, arising from freedom, and a limited monarchy, she marks. An immediate Vision attends, and paints her words. Invocation. O my lamented Talbot! while with thee The Muse gay roved the glad Hesperian round, And drew the inspiring breath of ancient arts; Ah! little thought she her returning verse Should sing our darling subject to thy Shade. And does the mystic veil, from mortal beam, Involve those eyes where every virtue smiled, And all thy Father's candid spirit shone? The light of reason, pure, without a cloud; Full of the generous heart, the mild regard; Honour disdaining blemish, cordial faith, And limpid truth, that looks the very soul. But to the death of mighty nations turn My strain; be there absorpt the private tear. Musing, I lay; warm from the sacred walks, Where at each step imagination burns: While scatter'd wide around, awful, and hoar, Lies, a vast monument, once glorious Rome, The tomb of empire! Ruins! that efface Whate'er, of finish'd, modern pomp can boast. Snatch'd by these wonders to that world where thought Unfetter'd ranges, Fancy's magic hand Led me anew o'er all the solemn scene, Still in the mind's pure eye more solemn dress'd: When straight, methought, the fair majestic Power Of Liberty appear'd. Not, as of old, Extended in her hand the cap, and rod, Whose slave-enlarging touch gave double life: But her bright temples bound with British oak, And naval honours nodded on her brow. Sublime of port: loose o'er her shoulder flow'd Her sea-green robe, with constellations gay. An island-goddess now; and her high care The Queen of Isles, the mistress of the main. My heart beat filial transport at the sight; And, as she moved to speak, the awaken'd Muse Listen'd intense. Awhile she look'd around, With mournful eye the well known ruins mark'd, And then, her sighs repressing, thus began: âMine are these wonders, all thou seest is mine; But ah, how changed! the falling poor remains Of what exalted once the Ausonian shore. Look back through time: and, rising from the gloom, Mark the dread scene, that paints whate'er I say. âThe great Republic see! that glow'd, sublime, With the mix'd freedom of a thousand states; Raised on the thrones of kings her curule chair, And by her fasces awed the subject world. See busy millions quickening all the land, With cities throng'd, and teeming culture high: For Nature then smiled on her free-born sons, And pour'd the plenty that belongs to men. Behold, the country cheering, villas rise, In lively prospect; by the secret lapse Of brooks now lost, and streams renown'd in song; In Umbria's closing vales, or on the brow Of her brown hills that breathe the scented gale: On BaiÃ¦'s viny coast; where peaceful seas, Fann'd by kind zephyrs, ever kiss the shore; And suns unclouded shine, through purest air: Or in the spacious neighbourhood of Rome; Far shining upward to the Sabine hills, To Anio's roar, and Tibur's olive shade; To where PrenestÃ¨ lifts her airy brow; Or downward spreading to the sunny shore, Where Alba breathes the freshness of the main. âSee distant mountains leave their valleys dry, And o'er the proud Arcade their tribute pour, To lave imperial Rome. For ages laid, Deep, massy, firm, diverging every way, With tombs of heroes sacred, see her roads; By various nations trod, and suppliant kings; With legions flaming, or with triumph gay. âFull in the centre of these wondrous works, The pride of earth! Rome in her glory see! Behold her demigods, in senate met; All head to counsel, and all heart to act: The commonweal inspiring every tongue With fervent eloquence, unbribed, and bold; Ere tame Corruption taught the servile herd To rank obedient to a master's voice. âHer Forum see, warm, popular, and loud, In trembling wonder hush'd, when the two Sires, Lucius Junius Brutus, and Virginius. As they the private father greatly quell'd, Stood up the public fathers of the state. See Justice judging there, in human shape. Hark! how with freedom's voice it thunders high, Or in soft murmurs sinks to Tully's tongue. âHer tribes, her census, see; her generous troops, Whose pay was glory, and their best reward Free for their country and for me to die; Ere mercenary murder grew a trade. âMark, as the purple triumph waves along, The highest pomp and lowest fall of life. âHer festive games, the school of heroes, see; Her Circus, ardent with contending youth: Her streets, her temples, palaces, and baths, Full of fair forms, of Beauty's eldest born, And of a people cast in virtue's mould: While sculpture lives around, and Asian hills Lend their best stores to heave the pillar'd dome: All that to Roman strength the softer touch Of Grecian art can join. But language fails To paint this sun, this centre of mankind; Where every virtue, glory, treasure, art, Attracted strong, in heighten'd lustre met. âNeed I the contrast mark? unjoyous view! A land in all, in government and arts, In virtue, genius, earth, and heaven, reversed, Who but these far famed ruins to behold, Proofs of a people, whose heroic aims Soar'd far above the little selfish sphere Of doubting modern life; who but inflamed With classic zeal, these consecrated scenes Of men and deeds to trace; unhappy land, Would trust thy wilds, and cities loose of sway? âAre these the vales, that, once, exulting states In their warm bosom fed? The mountains these, On whose high-blooming sides my sons, of old, I bred to glory? These dejected towns, Where, mean and sordid, life can scarce subsist, The scenes of ancient opulence and pomp? âCome! by whatever sacred name disguised. Oppression, come! and in thy works rejoice! See nature's richest plains to putrid fens Turn'd by thy fury. From their cheerful bounds, See razed the enlivening village, farm, and seat. First, rural toil, by thy rapacious hand Robb'd of his poor reward, resign'd the plough; And now he dares not turn the noxious glebe. 'Tis thine entire. The lonely swain himself, Who loves at large along the grassy downs His flocks to pasture, thy drear champaign flies. Far as the sickening eye can sweep around, 'Tis all one desert, desolate, and grey, Grazed by the sullen buffalo alone; And where the rank uncultivated growth Of rotting ages taints the passing gale. Beneath the baleful blast the city pines, Or sinks enfeebled, or infected burns. Beneath it mourns the solitary road, Roll'd in rude mazes o'er the abandon'd waste; While ancient ways, ingulf'd, are seen no more. âSuch thy dire plains, thou self-destroyer! foe To humankind! thy mountains too, profuse, Where savage nature blooms, seem their sad plaint To raise against thy desolating rod. There on the breezy brow, where thriving states And famous cities, once, to the pleased sun, Far other scenes of rising culture spread, Pale shine thy ragged towns. Neglected round, Each harvest pines; the livid, lean produce Of heartless labour: while thy hated joys, Not proper pleasure, lift the lazy hand. Better to sink in sloth the woes of life, Than wake their rage with unavailing toil. Hence, drooping art almost to nature leaves The rude unguided year. Thin wave the gifts Of yellow Ceres, thin the radiant blush Of orchard reddens in the warmest ray. To weedy wildness run, no rural wealth (Such as dictators fed) the garden pours, Crude the wild olive flows, and foul the vine; Nor juice CÃ¦cubian, or Falernian, more, Streams life and joy, save in the Muse's bowl. Unseconded by art, the spinning race Draw the bright thread in vain, and idly toil. In vain, forlorn in wilds, the citron blows; And flowering plants perfume the desert gale. Through the vile thorn the tender myrtle twines: Inglorious droops the laurel, dead to song, And long a stranger to the hero's brow. âNor half thy triumph this: cast, from brute fields, Into the haunts of men thy ruthless eye. There buxom Plenty never turns her horn; The grace and virtue of exterior life, No clean convenience reigns; e'en sleep itself, Least delicate of powers, reluctant, there, Lays on the bed impure his heavy head. Thy horrid walk! dead, empty, unadorn'd, See streets whose echoes never know the voice Of cheerful hurry, commerce many-tongued, And art mechanic at his various task, Fervent, employ'd. Mark the desponding race, Of occupation void, as void of hope; Hope, the glad ray, glanced from Eternal Good, That life enlivens, and exalts its powers, With views of fortuneâmadness all to them! By thee relentless seized their better joys, To the soft aid of cordial airs they fly, Breathing a kind oblivion o'er their woes, And love and music melt their souls away. From feeble Justice, see how rash Revenge, Trembling, the balance snatches; and the sword, Fearful himself, to venal ruffians gives. See where God's altar, nursing murder, stands, With the red touch of dark assassins stain'd. âBut chief let Rome, the mighty city! speak The full-exerted genius of thy reign. Behold her rise amid the lifeless waste, Expiring nature all corrupted round; While the lone Tiber, through the desert plain, Winds his waste stores, and sullen sweeps along. Patch'd from my fragments, in unsolid pomp, Mark how the temple glares; and artful dress'd, Amusive, draws the superstitious train. Mark how the palace lifts a lying front, Concealing often, in magnific jail, Proud want; a deep unanimated gloom! And oft adjoining to the drear abode Of misery, whose melancholy walls Seem its voracious grandeur to reproach. Within the city bounds the desert see. See the rank vine o'er subterranean roofs, Indecent, spread; beneath whose fretted gold It once, exulting, flow'd. The people mark, Matchless, while fired by me; to public good Inexorably firm, just, generous, brave, Afraid of nothing but unworthy life, Elate with glory, an heroic soul Known to the vulgar breast: behold them now A thin despairing number, all-subdued, The slaves of slaves, by superstition fool'd, By vice unmann'd and a licentious rule; In guile ingenious, and in murder brave. Such in one land, beneath the same fair clime, Thy sons, Oppression, are; and such were mine. âE'en with thy labour'd Pomp, for whose vain show Deluded thousands starve; all age-begrimed, Torn, robb'd, and scatter'd in unnumber'd sacks, And by the tempest of two thousand years Continual shaken, let my ruins vie. These roads that yet the Roman hand assert, Beyond the weak repair of modern toil; These fractured arches, that the chiding stream No more delighted hear; these rich remains Of marbles now unknown, where shines imbibed Each parent ray; these massy columns, hew'd From Afric's farthest shore; one granite all, These obelisks high-towering to the sky, Mysterious mark'd with dark Egyptian lore; These endless wonders that this sacred Via Sacra. way Illumine still, and consecrate to fame; These fountains, vases, urns, and statues, charged With the fine stores of art-completing Greece. Mine is, besides, thy every later boast: Thy Buonarotis, thy Palladios mine; And mine the fair designs, which Raphael's Michael Angelo Buonaroti, Palladio, and Raphael d'Urbino; the three great modern masters in sculpture, architecture, and painting. soul O'er the live canvass, emanating, breathed. âWhat would you say, ye conquerors of earth! Ye Romans! could you raise the laurel'd head; Could you the country see, by seas of blood, And the dread toil of ages, won so dear; Your pride, your triumph, your supreme delight! For whose defence oft, in the doubtful hour, You rush'd with rapture down the gulf of fate, Of death ambitious! till by awful deeds, Virtues, and courage, that amaze mankind, The queen of nations rose; possess'd of all Which nature, art, and glory could bestow: What would you say, deep in the last abyss Of slavery, vice, and unambitious want, Thus to behold her sunk? your crowded plains, Void of their cities; unadorn'd your hills; Ungraced your lakes; your ports to ships unknown; Your lawless floods, and your abandon'd streams; These could you know; these could you love again? Thy Tiber, Horace, could it now inspire, Content, poetic ease, and rural joy, Soon bursting into song: while through the groves Of headlong Anio, dashing to the vale, In many a tortured stream, you mused along? Yon wild retreat, Tusculum is reckoned to have stood at a place now called Grotta Ferrata, a convent of monks. where superstition dreams, Could, Tully, you your Tusculum believe? And could you deem yon naked hills, that form, Famed in old song, the ship-forsaken bay, The bay of Mola (anciently FormiÃ¦) into which Homer brings Ulysses and his companions. Near FormiÃ¦ Cicero had a villa. Your Formian shore? Once the delight of earth, Where art and nature, ever smiling, join'd On the gay land to lavish all their stores. How changed, how vacant, Virgil, wide around, Would now your Naples seem? disaster'd less By Black Vesuvius thundering o'er the coast His midnight earthquakes, and his mining fires, Than by despotic rage: Naples, then under the Austrian government. that inward gnaws A native foe; a foreign, tears without. First from your flatter'd CÃ¦sars this began: Till, doom'd to tyrants an eternal prey, Thin peopled spreads, at last, the syren plain, Campagna Felice, adjoining to Capua. That the dire soul of Hannibal disarm'd; And wrapt in weeds the shore The coast of BaiÃ¦, which was formerly adorned with the works mentioned in the following lines; and where, amidst many magnificent ruins, those of a temple erected to Venus are still to be seen. of Venus lies. There BaiÃ¦ sees no more the joyous throng; Her bank all beaming with the pride of Rome: No generous vines now bask along the hills, Where sport the breezes of the Tyrrhene main: With baths and temples mix'd, no villas rise; Nor, art-sustain'd amid reluctant waves, Draw the cool murmurs of the breathing deep: No spreading ports their sacred arms extend: No mighty moles the big intrusive storm, From the calm station, roll resounding back. An almost total desolation sits, A dreary stillness, saddening o'er the coast; Where, All along this coast the ancient Romans had their winter retreats; and several populous cities stood. when soft suns and tepid winters rose, Rejoicing crowds inhaled the balm of peace; Where citied hill to hill reflected blaze; And, where, with Ceres Bacchus wont to hold A genial strife. Her youthful form, robust, E'en Nature yields; by fire, and earthquake rent: Whole stately cities in the dark abrupt Swallow'd at once, or vile in rubbish laid, A nest for serpents; from the red abyss New hills, explosive, thrown; the Lucrine lake A reedy pool: and all to Cuma's point, The sea recovering his usurp'd domain, And pour'd triumphant o'er the buried dome. âHence, Britain, learn; my best establish'd, last, And more than Greece, or Rome, my steady reign; The land where, King and People equal bound By guardian laws, my fullest blessings flow; And where my jealous unsubmitting soul, The dread of tyrants! burns in every breast: Learn hence, if such the miserable fate Of an heroic race, the masters once Of humankind; what, when deprived of me, How grievous must be thine? in spite of climes, Whose sun-enliven'd ether wakes the soul To higher powers; in spite of happy soils, That, but by labour's slightest aid impell'd, With treasures teem to thy cold clime unknown; If there desponding fail the common arts, And sustenance of life: could life itself, Far less a thoughtless tyrant's hollow pomp, Subsist with thee? against depressing skies, Join'd to full spread oppression's cloudy brow, How could thy spirits hold? where vigour find, Forced fruits to tear from their unnative soil? Or, storing every harvest in thy ports, To plough the dreadful all producing wave?â Here paused the Goddess. By the cause assured, In trembling accents thus I moved my prayer: âOh first, and most benevolent of powers! Come from eternal splendours, here on earth, Against despotic pride, and rage, and lust, To shield mankind; to raise them to assert The native rights and honour of their race: Teach me, thy lowest subject, but in zeal Yielding to none, the progress of thy reign, And with a strain from thee enrich the Muse. As thee alone she serves, her patron, thou, And great inspirer be! then will she joy, Though narrow life her lot, and private shade: And when her venal voice she barters vile, Or to thy open or thy secret foes; May ne'er those sacred raptures touch her more, By slavish hearts unfelt! and may her song Sink in oblivion with the nameless crew! Vermin of state! to thy o'erflowing light That owe their being, yet betray thy cause.â Then, condescending kind, the heavenly Power Return'd:ââWhat here, suggested by the scene, I slight unfold, record and sing at home, In that bless'd isle, where (so we spirits move) With one quick effort of my will I am. There Truth, unlicensed, walks; and dares accost E'en kings themselves, the monarchs of the free! Fix'd on my rock, there, an indulgent race O'er Britons wield the sceptre of their choice: And there, to finish what his sires began, A Prince behold! for me who burns sincere, E'en with a subject's zeal. He my great work Will parent-like sustain; and added give The touch the Graces and the Muses owe. For Britain's glory swells his panting breast; And ancient arts he emulous revolves: His pride to let the smiling heart abroad, Through clouds of pomp, that but conceal the man; To please his pleasure; bounty his delight; And all the soul of Titus dwells in him.â Hail, glorious theme! but how, alas! shall verse, From the crude stores of mortal language drawn, How faint and tedious, sing, what, piercing deep, The Goddess flash'd at once upon my soul. For, clear precision all, the tongue of gods Is harmony itself; to every ear Familiar known, like light to every eye. Meantime disclosing ages, as she spoke, In long succession pour'd their empires forth; Scene after scene, the human drama spread; And still the embodied picture rose to sight. Oh thou! to whom the Muses owe their flame; Who bidd'st, beneath the pole, Parnassus rise, And HippocrenÃ¨ flow; with thy bold ease, The striking force, the lightning of thy thought, And thy strong phrase, that rolls profound and clear; Oh, gracious Goddess! reinspire my song; While I, to nobler than poetic fame Aspiring, thy commands to Britons bear. PART II. GREECE. CONTENTS. Liberty traced from the pastoral ages, and the first uniting of neighbouring families into civil government. The several establishments of Liberty, in Egypt, Persia, PhÅnicia, Palestine, slightly touched upon, down to her great establishment in Greece. Geographical description of Greece. Sparta and Athens, the two principal states of Greece, described. Influence of Liberty over all the Grecian states; with regard to their Government, their Politeness, their Virtues, their Arts, and Sciences. The vast superiority it gave them, in point of force and bravery, over the Persians, exemplified by the action of ThermopylÃ¦, the battle of Marathon, and the retreat of the Ten Thousand. Its full exertion, and most beautiful effects in Athens. Liberty the source of free Philosophy. The various schools which took their rise from Socrates. Enumeration of Fine Arts: Eloquence, Poetry, Music, Sculpture, Painting, and Architecture; the effects of Liberty in Greece, and brought to their utmost perfection there. Transition to the modern state of Greece. Why Liberty declined, and was at last entirely lost among the Greeks. Concluding Reflection. Thus spoke the Goddess of the fearless eye; And at her voice, renew'd, the Vision rose: âFirst, in the dawn of time, with eastern swains, In woods, and tents, and cottages, I lived; While on from plain to plain they led their flocks, In search of clearer spring, and fresher field. These, as increasing families disclosed The tender state, I taught an equal sway. Few were offences, properties, and laws. Beneath the rural portal, palm-o'erspread, The father senate met. There Justice dealt, With reason then and equity the same, Free as the common air, her prompt decree; Nor yet had stain'd her sword with subjects' blood. The simpler arts were all their simple wants Had urged to light. But instant, these supplied, Another set of fonder wants arose, And other arts with them of finer aim; Till, from refining want to want impell'd, The mind by thinking push'd her latent powers, And life began to glow, and arts to shine. âAt first, on brutes alone the rustic war Launch'd the rude spear; swift, as he glared along, On the grim lion, or the robber wolf. For then young sportive life was void of toil, Demanding little, and with little pleased: But when to manhood grown, and endless joys, Led on by equal toils, the bosom fired; Lewd lazy rapine broke primeval peace, And, hid in caves and idle forests drear, From the lone pilgrim, and the wandering swain, Seized what he durst not earn. Then brother's blood First, horrid, smoked on the polluted skies. Awful in justice, then the burning youth, Led by their temper'd sires, on lawless men, The last worst monsters of the shaggy wood, Turn'd the keen arrow, and the sharpen'd spear. Then war grew glorious. Heroes then arose; Who, scorning coward self, for others lived, Toil'd for their ease, and for their safety bled. West, with the living day, to Greece I came: Earth smiled beneath my beam: the Muse before Sonorous flew, that low till then in woods Had tuned the reed, and sigh'd the shepherd's pain; But now, to sing heroic deeds, she swell'd A nobler note, and bade the banquet burn. âFor Greece my sons of Egypt I forsook; A boastful race, that in the vain abyss Of fabling ages loved to lose their source, And with their river traced it from the skies. While there my laws alone despotic reign'd, And king, as well as people, proud obey'd; I taught them science, virtue, wisdom, arts; By poets, sages, legislators sought; The school of polish'd life, and human kind. But when mysterious Superstition came, And, with her Civil Sister Civil Tyranny. leagued, involved In studied darkness the desponding mind; Then Tyrant Power the righteous scourge unloosed: For yielded reason speaks the soul a slave. Instead of useful works, like nature's, great, Enormous, cruel wonders crush'd the land; And round a tyrant's tomb, The Pyramids. who none deserved, For one vile carcass perish'd countless lives. Then the great Dragon, The Tyrants of Egypt. couch'd amid his floods, Swell'd his fierce heart, and cried, âThis flood is mine, 'Tis I that bid it flow.â But, undeceived, His frenzy soon the proud blasphemer felt; Felt that, without my fertilizing power, Suns lost their force, and Niles o'erflow'd in vain. Nought could retard me: nor the frugal state Of rising Persia, sober in extreme, Beyond the pitch of man, and thence reversed Into luxurious waste: nor yet the ports Of old PhÅnicia; first for letters famed, That paint the voice, and silent speak to sight; Of arts prime source, and guardian! by fair stars, First tempted out into the lonely deep; To whom I first disclosed mechanic arts, The winds to conquer, to subdue the waves, With all the peaceful power of ruling trade; Earnest of Britain. Nor by these retain'd; Nor by the neighbouring land, whose palmy shore The silver Jordan laves. Before me lay The promised Land of Arts, and urged my flight. âHail, Nature's utmost boast! unrival'd Greece! My fairest reign! where every power benign Conspired to blow the flower of human kind, And lavish'd all that genius can inspire. Clear sunny climates, by the breezy main, IÃ¶nian or Ãgean, temper'd kind: Light, airy soils: a country rich, and gay; Broke into hills with balmy odours crown'd, And, bright with purple harvest, joyous vales: Mountains, and streams, where verse spontaneous flow'd; Whence deem'd by wondering men the seat of gods, And still the mountains and the streams of song. All that boon Nature could luxuriant pour Of high materials, and my restless Arts Frame into finish'd life. How many states, And clustering towns, and monuments of fame, And scenes of glorious deeds, in little bounds? From the rough tract of bending mountains, beat By Adria's here, there by Ãgean waves; To where the deep adorning Cyclade Isles In shining prospect rise, and on the shore Of farthest Crete resounds the Libyan main. âO'er all two rival cities rear'd the brow, And balanced all. Spread on Eurotas' bank, Amid a circle of soft rising hills, The patient Sparta one: the sober, hard, And man-subduing city; which no shape Of pain could conquer, nor of pleasure charm. Lycurgus there built, on the solid base Of equal life, so well a temper'd state; Where mix'd each government, in such just poise; Each power so checking, and supporting each; That firm for ages, and unmoved, it stood, The fort of Greece! without one giddy hour, One shock of faction, or of party rage. For, drain'd the springs of wealth, Corruption there Lay wither'd at the root. Thrice happy land! Had not neglected art, with weedy vice Confounded, sunk. But if Athenian arts Loved not the soil; yet there the calm abode Of wisdom, virtue, philosophic ease, Of manly sense and wit, in frugal phrase Confined, and press'd into Laconic force. There too, by rooting thence still treacherous self, The Public and the Private grew the same. The children of the nursing Public all, And at its table fed; for that they toil'd, For that they lived entire, and even for that The tender mother urged her son to die. âOf softer genius, but not less intent To seize the palm of empire, Athens rose. Where, with bright marbles big and future pomp, Hymettus A mountain near Athens. spread, amid the scented sky, His thymy treasures to the labouring bee, And to botanic hand the stores of health; Wrapt in a soul-attenuating clime, Between Ilissus and Cephissus Two rivers, betwixt which Athens was situated. glow'd This hive of science, shedding sweets divine, Of active arts, and animated arms. There, passionate for me, an easy moved, A quick, refined, a delicate, humane, Enlighten'd people reign'd. Oft on the brink Of ruin, hurried by the charm of speech, Inforcing hasty counsel immature, Totter'd the rash Democracy; unpoised, And by the rage devour'd, that ever tears A populace unequal; part too rich, And part or fierce with want or abject grown. Solon at last, their mild restorer, rose: Allay'd the tempest; to the calm of laws Reduced the settling whole; and, with the weight Which the two senates The Areopagus, or Supreme Court of Judicature, which Solon reformed and improved: and the council of Four Hundred, by him instituted. In this council all affairs of state were deliberated, before they came to be voted in the assembly of the people. to the public lent, As with an anchor fix'd the driving state. âNor was my forming care to these confined. For emulation through the whole I pour'd, Noble contention! who should most excel In government well poised, adjusted best To public weal: in countries cultured high: In ornamented towns, where order reigns, Free social life, and polish'd manners fair: In exercise, and arms; arms only drawn For common Greece, to quell the Persian pride: In moral science, and in graceful arts. Hence, as for glory peacefully they strove, The prize grew greater, and the prize of all. By contest brighten'd, hence the radiant youth, Pour'd every beam; by generous pride inflamed, Felt every ardour burn: their great reward The verdant wreath, which sounding Pisa Or Olympia, the city where the Olympic games were celebrated. gave. âHence flourish'd Greece; and hence a race of men, As gods by conscious future times adored: In whom each virtue wore a smiling air, Each science shed o'er life a friendly light, Each art was nature. Spartan valour hence, At the famed pass, The Straits of ThermopylÃ¦. firm as an isthmus stood; And the whole eastern ocean, waving far As eye could dart its vision, nobly check'd. While in extended battle, at the field Of Marathon, my keen Athenians drove Before their ardent band a host of slaves. âHence through the continent ten thousand Greeks Urged a retreat, whose glory not the prime Of victories can reach. Deserts, in vain, Opposed their course; and hostile lands, unknown; And deep rapacious floods, dire bank'd with death; And mountains, in whose jaws destruction grinn'd; Hunger, and toil; Armenian snows, and storms; And circling myriads still of barbarous foes. Greece in their view, and glory yet untouch'd, Their steady column pierced the scattering herds, Which a whole empire pour'd; and held its way Triumphant, by the sage-exalted Chief Xenophon. Fired and sustain'd. Oh light and force of mind, Almost almighty in severe extremes! The sea at last from Colchian mountains seen, Kind-hearted transport round their captains threw The soldiers' fond embrace; o'erflow'd their eyes With tender floods, and loosed the general voice To cries resounding loudââThe sea! The sea!â âIn Attic bounds hence heroes, sages, wits, Shone thick as stars, the milky way of Greece! And though gay wit, and pleasing grace was theirs, All the soft modes of elegance, and ease; Yet was not courage less, the patient touch Of toiling art, and disquisition deep. âMy spirit pours a vigour through the soul, The unfetter'd thought with energy inspires, Invincible in arts, in the bright field Of nobler Science, as in that of Arms. Athenians thus not less intrepid burst The bonds of tyrant darkness, than they spurn'd The Persian chains: while through the city full Of mirthful quarrel and of witty war, Incessant struggled taste refining taste, And friendly free discussion, calling forth From the fair jewel Truth its latent ray. O'er all shone out the great Athenian Sage, Socrates. And Father of Philosophy: the sun, From whose white blaze emerged, each various sect Took various tints, but with diminish'd beam. Tutor of Athens! he, in every street, Dealt priceless treasure: goodness his delight, Wisdom his wealth, and glory his reward. Deep through the human heart, with playful art, His simple question stole; as into truth, And serious deeds, he smiled the laughing race; Taught moral happy life, whate'er can bless, Or grace mankind; and what he taught he was. Compounded high, though plain, his doctrine broke In different Schools: the bold poetic phrase Of figured Plato; Xenophon's pure strain, Like the clear brook that steals along the vale; Dissecting truth, the Stagyrite's keen eye; The exalted Stoic pride; the Cynic sneer; The slow-consenting Academic doubt; And, joining bliss to virtue, the glad ease Of Epicurus, seldom understood. They, ever candid, reason still opposed To reason; and, since virtue was their aim, Each by sure practice tried to prove his way The best. Then stood untouch'd the solid base Of Liberty, the liberty of mind: For systems yet, and soul-enslaving creeds, Slept with the monsters of succeeding times. From priestly darkness sprung the enlightening arts Of fire, and sword, and rage, and horrid names. âO Greece! thou sapient nurse of finer arts! Which to bright science blooming fancy bore; Be this thy praise, that thou, and thou alone, In these hast led the way, in these excell'd, Crown'd with the laurel of assenting Time. âIn thy full language, speaking mighty things; Like a clear torrent close, or else diffused A broad majestic stream, and rolling on Through all the winding harmony of sound: In it the power of Eloquence, at large, Breathed the persuasive or pathetic soul; Still'd by degrees the democratic storm, Or bade it threatening rise, and tyrants shook, Flush'd at the head of their victorious troops. In it the Muse, her fury never quench'd, By mean unyielding phrase, or jarring sound, Her unconfined divinity display'd; And, still harmonious, form'd it to her will: Or soft depress'd it to the shepherd's moan, Or raised it swelling to the tongue of gods. âHeroic song was thine; the Fountain Bard, Homer. Whence each poetic stream derives its course. Thine the dread moral scene, thy chief delight! Where idle Fancy durst not mix her voice, When Reason spoke august; the fervent heart Or plain'd, or storm'd; and in the impassioned man, Concealing art with art, the poet sunk. This potent school of manners, but when left To loose neglect, a land-corrupting plague, Was not unworthy deem'd of public care, And boundless cost, by thee; whose every son, E'en last mechanic, the true taste possess'd Of what had flavour to the nourish'd soul. âThe sweet enforcer of the poet's strain, Thine was the meaning music of the heart. Not the vain trill, that, void of passion, runs In giddy mazes, tickling idle ears; But that deep-searching voice, and artful hand, To which respondent shakes the varied soul. âThy fair ideas, thy delightful forms, By Love imagined, by the Graces touch'd, The boast of well pleased Nature! Sculpture seized, And bade them ever smile in Parian stone. Selecting Beauty's choice, and that again Exalting, blending in a perfect whole, Thy workmen left e'en Nature's self behind. From those far different, whose prolific hand Peoples a nation; they for years on years, By the cool touches of judicious toil, Their rapid genius curbing, pour'd it all Through the live features of one breathing stone. There, beaming full, it shone; expressing gods: Jove's awful brow, Apollo's air divine, The fierce atrocious frown of sinewed Mars, Or the sly graces of the Cyprian Queen. Minutely perfect all! Each dimple sunk, And every muscle swell'd, as nature taught. In tresses, braided gay, the marble waved; Flow'd in loose robes, or thin transparent veils; Sprung into motion; softened into flesh; Was fired to passion, or refined to soul. âNor less thy pencil, with creative touch, Shed mimic life, when all thy brightest dames, Assembled, Zeuxis in his Helen mix'd. And when Apelles, who peculiar knew To give a grace that more than mortal smiled, The soul of beauty! call'd the Queen of Love, Fresh from the billows, blushing orient charms. E'en such enchantment then thy pencil pour'd, That cruel-thoughted War the impatient torch Dash'd to the ground; and, rather than destroy The patriot picture, When Demetrius besieged Rhodes, and could have reduced the city, by setting fire to that quarter of it where stood the house of the celebrated Protogenes; he chose rather to raise the siege, than hazard the burning of a famous picture called Jasylus, the masterpiece of that painter. let the city scape. âFirst, elder Sculpture taught her sister art Correct design; where great ideas shone, And in the secret trace expression spoke: Taught her the graceful attitude; the turn, And beauteous airs of head; the native act, Or bold, or easy; and, cast free behind, The swelling mantle's well adjusted flow. Then the bright Muse, their eldest sister, came; And bade her follow where she led the way: Bade earth, and sea, and air, in colours rise; And copious action on the canvass glow: Gave her gay Fable; spread Invention's store; Enlarged her View; taught Composition high, And just Arrangement, circling round one point, That starts to sight, binds and commands the whole. Caught from the heavenly Muse a nobler aim, And scorning the soft trade of mere delight, O'er all thy temples, porticos, and schools, Heroic deeds she traced, and warm display'd Each moral beauty to the ravish'd eye. There, as the imagined presence of the god Aroused the mind, or vacant hours induced Calm contemplation, or assembled youth Burn'd in ambitious circle round the sage, The living lesson stole into the heart, With more prevailing force than dwells in words. These rouse to glory; while, to rural life, The softer canvass oft reposed the soul. There gayly broke the sun-illumined cloud; The lessening prospect, and the mountain blue, Vanish'd in air; the precipice frown'd, dire; White, down the rock, the rushing torrent dash'd; The sun shone, trembling, o'er the distant main; The tempest foam'd, immense; the driving storm Sadden'd the skies, and, from the doubling gloom, On the scath'd oak the ragged lightning fell; In closing shades, and where the current strays, With Peace, and Love, and innocence around, Piped the lone shepherd to his feeding flock: Round happy parents smiled their younger selves; And friends conversed, by death divided long. âTo public virtue thus the smiling arts, Unblemish'd handmaids, served; the Graces they To dress this fairest Venus. Thus revered, And placed beyond the reach of sordid care, The high awarders of immortal fame, Alone for glory thy great masters strove; Courted by kings, and by contending states Assumed the boasted honour of their birth. âIn Architecture too thy rank supreme! That art where most magnificent appears The little builder man; by thee refined, And, smiling high, to full perfection brought. Such thy sure rules, that Goths of every age, Who scorn'd their aid, have only loaded earth With labour'd heavy monuments of shame. Not those gay domes that o'er thy splendid shore Shot, all proportion, up. First unadorn'd, And nobly plain, the manly Doric rose; The Ionic then, with decent matron grace, Her airy pillar heaved; luxuriant last, The rich Corinthian spread her wanton wreath. The whole so measured true, so lessen'd off By fine proportion, that the marble pile, Form'd to repel the still or stormy waste Of rolling ages, light as fabrics look'd That from the magic wand aÃ«rial rise. âThese were the wonders that illumined Greece, From end to endââHere interrupting warm, âWhere are they now? (I cried) say, goddess, where? And what the land, thy darling thus of old?â âSunk! (she resumed) deep in the kindred gloom Of Superstition, and of Slavery, sunk! No glory now can touch their hearts, benumb'd By loose dejected sloth and servile fear: No science pierce the darkness of their minds; No nobler art the quick ambitious soul Of imitation in their breast awake. E'en to supply the needful arts of life, Mechanic toil denies the hopeless hand. Scarce any trace remaining, vestige grey, Or nodding column on the desert shore, To point where Corinth, or where Athens stood. A faithless land of violence, and death! Where commerce parleys, dubious, on the shore; And his wild impulse curious search restrains, Afraid to trust the inhospitable clime. Neglected nature fails; in sordid want Sunk, and debased, their beauty beams no more. The sun himself seems, angry, to regard, Of light unworthy, the degenerate race; And fires them oft with pestilential rays: While earth, blue poison steaming on the skies, Indignant, shakes them from her troubled sides. But as from man to man, Fate's first decree, Impartial Death the tide of riches rolls, So states must die and Liberty go round. âFierce was the stand, ere Virtue, Valour, Arts, And the soul fired by me (that often, stung With thoughts of better times and old renown, From hydra-tyrants tried to clear the land) Lay quite extinct in Greece, their works effaced And gross o'er all unfeeling bondage spread. Sooner I moved my much reluctant flight, Poised on the doubtful wing: when Greece with Greece Embroil'd in foul contention fought no more For common glory, and for common weal: But false to Freedom, sought to quell the free; Broke the firm band of Peace, and sacred Love, That lent the whole irrefragable force; And, as around the partial trophy blush'd, Prepared the way for total overthrow. Then to the Persian power, whose pride they scorn'd, When Xerxes pour'd his millions o'er the land, Sparta, by turns, and Athens, vilely sued; Sued to be venal parricides, to spill Their country's bravest blood, and on themselves To turn their matchless mercenary arms. Peaceful in Susa, then, sat the Great King; So the kings of Persia were called by the Greeks. And by the trick of treaties, the still waste Of sly corruption, and barbaric gold, Effected what his steel could ne'er perform. Profuse he gave them the luxurious draught, Inflaming all the land: unbalanced wide Their tottering states; their wild assemblies ruled, As the winds turn at every blast the seas: And by their listed orators, whose breath Still with a factious storm infested Greece, Roused them to civil war, or dash'd them down To sordid peaceâPeace! The peace made by Antalcidas, the Lacedemonian admiral, with the Persians; by which the Lacedemonians abandoned all the Greeks established in the lesser Asia, to the dominion of the King of Persia. that, when Sparta shook Astonish'd Artaxerxes on his throne, Gave up, fair-spread o'er Asia's sunny shore, Their kindred cities to perpetual chains. What could so base, so infamous a thought In Spartan hearts inspire? Jealous, they saw Respiring Athens Athens had been dismantled by the Lacedemonians, at the end of the first Peloponnesian war, and was at this time restored by Conon to its former splendour. rear again her walls: And the pale fury fired them, once again To crush this rival city to the dust. For now no more the noble social soul Of Liberty my families combined; But by short views, and selfish passions, broke, Dire as when friends are rankled into foes, They mix'd severe, and waged eternal war: Nor felt they, furious, their exhausted force; Nor, with false glory, discord, madness blind, Saw how the blackening storm from Thracia came. Long years roll'd on, The Peloponnesian war. by many a battle stain'd, The blush and boast of Fame! where courage, art, And military glory shone supreme: But let detesting ages, from the scene Of Greece self-mangled, turn the sickening eye. At last, when bleeding from a thousand wounds, She felt her spirits fail; and in the dust Her latest heroes, Nicias, Conon, lay, Agesilaus, and the Theban friends: Pelopidas and Epaminondas. The Macedonian vulture mark'd his time, By the dire scent of CheronÃ¦a The battle of CheronÃ¦a, in which Philip of Macedon utterly defeated the Greeks. lured, And, fierce descending, seized his hapless prey. âThus tame submitted to the victor's yoke Greece, once the gay, the turbulent, the bold; For every grace, and muse, and science born; With arts of War, of Government, elate; To tyrants dreadful, dreadful to the best; Whom I myself could scarcely rule: and thus The Persian fetters, that inthrall'd the mind, Were turn'd to formal and apparent chains. âUnless Corruption first deject the pride, And guardian vigour of the free-born soul, All crude attempts of Violence are vain; For firm within, and while at heart untouch'd, Ne'er yet by Force was freedom overcome. But soon as Independence stoops the head, To Vice enslaved, and vice-created Wants; Then to some foul corrupting hand, whose waste These heighten'd wants with fatal bounty feeds: From man to man the slackening ruin runs, Till the whole state unnerved in Slavery sinks.â PART III. ROME. CONTENTS. As this part contains a description of the establishment of Liberty in Rome, it begins with a view of the Grecian Colonies settled in the southern parts of Italy, which with Sicily constituted the Great Greece of the Ancients. With these colonies, the Spirit of Liberty, and of Republics, spreads over Italy. Transition to Pythagoras and his philosophy, which he taught through those free states and cities. Amidst the many small Republics in Italy, Rome the destined seat of Liberty. Her establishment there dated from the expulsion of the Tarquins. How differing from that in Greece. Reference to a view of the Roman Republic given in the First Part of this Poem: to mark its Rise and Fall the peculiar purport of this. During its first ages, the greatest force of Liberty and Virtue exerted. The source whence derived the Heroic Virtues of the Romans. Enumeration of these Virtues. Thence their security at home; their glory, success, and empire abroad. Bounds of the Roman empire geographically described. The states of Greece restored to Liberty, by Titus Quintus Flaminius, the highest instance of public generosity and beneficence. The loss of Liberty in Rome. Its causes, progress, and completion in the death of Brutus. Rome under the emperors. From Rome the Goddess of Liberty goes among the Northern Nations; where, by infusing into them her Spirit and general principles, she lays the groundwork of her future establishments; sends them in vengeance on the Roman empire, now totally enslaved; and then, with Arts and Sciences in her train, quits earth during the dark ages. The celestial regions, to which Liberty retired, not proper to be opened to the view of mortals. Here melting mixed with air the ideal forms That painted still whate'er the goddess sung. Then I, impatient.ââFrom extinguish'd Greece, To what new region stream'd the Human Day?â She softly sighing, as when Zephyr leaves, Resign'd to Boreas, the declining year, Resumed.ââIndignant, these last scenes I fled; The last struggles of Liberty in Greece. And long ere then, Leucadia's cloudy cliff, And the Ceraunian hills behind me thrown, All Latium stood aroused. Ages before, Great mother of republics! Greece had pour'd, Swarm after swarm, her ardent youth around. On Asia, Afric, Sicily, they stoop'd, But chief on fair Hesperia's winding shore; Where, from Lacinium A promontory in Calabria. to Etrurian vales, They roll'd increasing colonies along, And lent materials for my Roman reign. With them my spirit spread; and numerous states, And cities rose, on Grecian models formed; As its parental policy and arts Each had imbibed. Besides, to each assign'd A guardian Genius, o'er the public weal, Kept an unclosing eye; tried to sustain, Or more sublime, the soul infused by me: And strong the battle rose, with various wave, Against the tyrant demons of the land. Thus they their little wars and triumphs knew; Their flows of fortune, and receding times, But almost all below the proud regard Of story vow'd to Rome, on deeds intent That Truth beyond the flight of Fable bore. âNot so the Samian sage; Pythagoras. to him belongs The brightest witness of recording Fame. For these free states his native isle Samos, over which then reigned the tyrant Polycrates. forsook, And a vain tyrant's transitory smile, He sought Crotona's pure salubrious air; And through Great Greece The southern parts of Italy and Sicily, so called because of the Grecian colonies there settled. his gentle wisdom taught; Wisdom that calm'd for listening years His scholars were enjoined silence for five years. the mind, Nor ever heard amid the storm of zeal. His mental eye first launch'd into the deeps Of boundless ether; where unnumber'd orbs, Myriads on myriads, through the pathless sky Unerring roll, and wind their steady way. There he the full consenting choir beheld; There first discern'd the secret band of love, The kind attraction, that to central suns Binds circling earths, and world with world unites. Instructed thence, he great ideas form'd Of the whole-moving, all-informing God, The Sun of beings! beaming unconfined Light, life, and love, and ever active power: Whom nought can image, and who best approves The silent worship of the moral heart, That joys in bounteous Heaven, and spreads the joy. Nor scorn'd the soaring sage to stoop to life, And bound his reason to the sphere of man. He gave the four yet reigning virtues The four cardinal virtues. name; Inspired the study of the finer arts, That civilize mankind, and laws devised Where with enlighten'd justice mercy mix'd. He e'en, into his tender system, took Whatever shares the brotherhood of life: He taught that life's indissoluble flame, From brute to man, and man to brute again, For ever shifting, runs the eternal round; Thence tried against the blood-polluted meal, And limbs yet quivering with some kindred soul, To turn the human heart. Delightful truth! Had he beheld the living chain ascend, And not a circling form but rising whole. âAmid these small republics one arose On yellow Tiber's bank, almighty Rome, Fated for me. A nobler spirit warm'd Her sons; and, roused by tyrants, nobler still It burn'd in Brutus; the proud Tarquins chased, With all their crimes; bade radiant eras rise, And the long honours of the Consul-line. âHere from the fairer, not the greater, plan Of Greece I varied; whose unmixing states, By the keen soul of emulation pierced, Long waged alone the bloodless war of arts, And their best empire gain'd. But to diffuse O'er men an empire was my purpose now: To let my martial majesty abroad; Into the vortex of one state to draw The whole mix'd force, and liberty, on earth; To conquer tyrants, and set nations free. âAlready have I given, with flying touch, A broken view of this my amplest reign. Now, while its first, last, periods you survey, Mark how it labouring rose, and rapid fell. âWhen Rome in noon-tide empire grasp'd the world, And, soon as her resistless legions shone, The nations stoop'd around; though then appear'd Her grandeur most; yet in her dawn of power, By many a jealous equal people press'd, Then was the toil, the mighty struggle then; Then for each Roman I a hero told; And every passing sun, and Latian scene, Saw patriot virtues then, and awful deeds, That or surpass the faith of modern times, Or, if believed, with sacred horror strike. âFor then, to prove my most exalted power, I to the point of full perfection push'd, To fondness and enthusiastic zeal, The great, the reigning passion of the free. That godlike passion! which, the bounds of self Divinely bursting, the whole public takes Into the heart, enlarged, and burning high With the mix'd ardour of unnumber'd selves; Of all who safe beneath the voted laws Of the same parent state, fraternal, live. From this kind sun of moral nature flow'd Virtues, that shine the light of humankind, And, ray'd through story, warm remotest time. These virtues too, reflected to their source, Increased its flame. The social charm went round, The fair idea, more attractive still, As more by virtue mark'd; till Romans, all One band of friends, unconquerable grew. âHence, when their country raised her plaintive voice, The voice of pleading Nature was not heard; And in their hearts the fathers throbb'd no more; Stern to themselves, but gentle to the whole. Hence sweeten'd Pain, the luxury of toil; Patience, that baffled fortune's utmost rage; High-minded Hope, which at the lowest ebb, When Brennus conquer'd, and when CannÃ¦ bled, The bravest impulse felt, and scorn'd despair. Hence Moderation a new conquest gain'd: As on the vanquish'd, like descending heaven, Their dewy mercy dropp'd, the bounty beam'd, And by the labouring hand were crowns bestow'd. Fruitful of men, hence hard laborious life, Which no fatigue can quell, no season pierce. Hence, Independence, with his little pleased Serene, and self-sufficient, like a god; In whom Corruption could not lodge one charm, While he his honest roots to gold preferr'd; While truly rich, and by his Sabine field, The man maintain'd, the Roman's splendour all Was in the public wealth and glory placed: Or ready, a rough swain, to guide the plough; Or else, the purple o'er his shoulder thrown, In long majestic flow, to rule the state, With Wisdom's purest eye; or, clad in steel, To drive the steady battle on the foe. Hence every passion, e'en the proudest, stoop'd To common good: Camillus, thy revenge; Thy glory, Fabius. All submissive hence, Consuls, Dictators, still resign'd their rule, The very moment that the laws ordain'd. Though Conquest o'er them clapp'd her eagle-wings, Her laurels wreath'd, and yoked her snowy steeds To the triumphal car; soon as expired The latest hour of sway, taught to submit, (A harder lesson that than to command) Into the private Roman sunk the chief. If Rome was served, and glorious, careless they By whom. Their country's fame they deem'd their own; And above envy, in a rival's train, Sung the loud IÃ¶s by themselves deserved. Hence matchless courage. On Cremera's bank, Hence fell the Fabii; hence the Decii died; And Curtius plunged into the flaming gulf. Hence Regulus the wavering fathers firm'd, By dreadful counsel never given before; For Roman honour sued, and his own doom. Hence he sustain'd to dare a death prepared By Punic rage. On earth his manly look Relentless fix'd, he from a last embrace, By chains polluted, put his wife aside, His little children climbing for a kiss; Then dumb through rows of weeping, wondering friends, A new illustrious exile! press'd along. Nor less impatient did he pierce the crowds Opposing his return, than if, escaped From long litigious suits, he glad forsook The noisy town a while and city cloud, To breathe Venafrian, or Tarentine air. Need I these high particulars recount? The meanest bosom felt a thirst for fame; Flight their worst death, and shame their only fear. Life had no charms, nor any terrors fate, When Rome and glory call'd. But, in one view, Mark the rare boast of these unequal'd times. Ages revolved unsullied by a crime: Astrea reign'd, and scarcely needed laws To bind a race elated with the pride Of virtue, and disdaining to descend To meanness, mutual violence, and wrongs. While war around them raged, in happy Rome All peaceful smiled, all save the passing clouds That often hang on Freedom's jealous brow; And fair unblemish'd centuries elapsed, When not a Roman bled but in the field. Their virtue such, that an unbalanced state, Still between Noble and Plebeian tost, As flow'd the wave of fluctuating power, Was then kept firm, and with triumphant prow Rode out the storms. Oft though the native feuds, That from the first their constitution shook, (A latent ruin, growing as it grew,) Stood on the threatening point of civil war Ready to rush: yet could the lenient voice Of wisdom, soothing the tumultuous soul, Those sons of virtue calm. Their generous hearts Unpetrified by self, so naked lay And sensible to Truth, that o'er the rage Of giddy faction, by oppression swell'd, Prevail'd a simple fable, and at once To peace recover'd the divided state. But if their often cheated hopes refused The soothing touch; still, in the love of Rome, The dread Dictator found a sure resource. Was she assaulted? was her glory stain'd? One common quarrel wide inflamed the whole. Foes in the forum in the field were friends, By social danger bound; each fond for each, And for their dearest country all, to die. âThus up the hill of empire slow they toil'd: Till, the bold summit gain'd, the thousand states Of proud Italia blended into one; Then o'er the nations they resistless rush'd, And touch'd the limits of the failing world. âLet Fancy's eye the distant lines unite. See that which borders wild the western main, Where storms at large resound, and tides immense; From Caledonia's dim cerulean coast, And moist Hibernia, to where Atlas, lodged Amid the restless clouds and leaning heaven, Hangs o'er the deep that borrows thence its name. Mark that opposed, where first the springing morn Her roses sheds, and shakes around her dews: From the dire deserts by the Caspian laved, To where the Tigris and Euphrates, join'd, Impetuous tear the Babylonian plain; And bless'd Arabia aromatic breathes. See that dividing far the watery north, Parent of floods! from the majestic Rhine, Drunk by Batavian meads, to where, seven-mouth'd, In Euxine waves the flashing Danube roars; To where the frozen Tanais scarcely stirs The dead Meotic pool, or the long Rha, The ancient name of the Volga. In the black Scythian sea The Caspian Sea. his torrent throws. Last, that beneath the burning zone behold: See where it runs, from the deep-loaded plains Of Mauritania to the Libyan sands, Where Ammon lifts amid the torrid waste A verdant isle, with shade and fountain fresh; And farther to the full Egyptian shore, To where the Nile from Ethiopian clouds, His never drain'd ethereal urn, descends. In this vast space what various tongues, and states! What bounding rocks, and mountains, floods, and seas! What purple tyrants quell'd, and nations freed! âO'er Greece, descended chief, with stealth divine, The Roman bounty in a flood of day: As at her Isthmian games, a fading pomp! Her full-assembled youth innumerous swarm'd. On a tribunal raised, Flaminius sat: A victor he, from the deep phalanx pierced Of iron-coated Macedon, and back The Grecian tyrant The King of Macedonia. to his bounds repell'd. In the high thoughtless gaiety of game, While sport alone their unambitious hearts Possess'd; the sudden trumpet, sounding hoarse Bade silence o'er the bright assembly reign. Then thus a herald:ââTo the states of Greece The Roman people, unconfined, restore Their countries, cities, liberties, and laws: Taxes remit, and garrisons withdraw.â The crowd astonish'd half, and half inform'd, Stared dubious round; some question'd, some exclaim'd, (Like one who dreaming, between hope and fear, Is lost in anxious joy,) âBe that again, Be that again proclaim'd, distinct, and loud.â Loud, and distinct, it was again proclaim'd; And still as midnight in the rural shade, When the gale slumbers, they the words devour'd. A while severe amazement held them mute, Then bursting broad, the boundless shout to Heaven From many a thousand hearts ecstatic sprung. On every hand rebellow'd to their joy The swelling sea, the rocks, and vocal hills: Through all her turrets stately Corinth The Isthmian games were celebrated at Corinth. shook; And, from the void above of shatter'd air, The flitting bird fell breathless to the ground. What piercing bliss, how keen a sense of fame, Did then, Flaminius, reach thy inmost soul! And with what deep-felt glory didst thou then Escape the fondness of transported Greece? Mix'd in a tempest of superior joy, They left the sports; like Bacchanals they flew, Each other straining in a strict embrace, Nor strain'd a slave; and loud acclaims till night Round the Proconsul's tent repeated rung. Then, crown'd with garlands, came the festive hours; And music, sparkling wine, and converse warm, Their raptures waked anew. âYe gods! (they cried) Ye guardian gods of Greece! and are we free? Was it not madness deem'd the very thought? And is it true? How did we purchase chains? At what a dire expense of kindred blood? And are they now dissolved? And scarce one drop For the fair first of blessings have we paid? Courage, and conduct, in the doubtful field, When rages wide the storm of mingling war, Are rare indeed; but how to generous ends To turn success, and conquest, rarer still: That the great gods and Romans only know. Lives there on earth, almost to Greece unknown, A people so magnanimous, to quit Their native soil, traverse the stormy deep, And by their blood and treasure, spent for us, Redeem our states, our liberties, and laws! There does! there does! Oh saviour, Titus! Rome!â Thus through the happy night they pour'd their souls, And in my last reflected beams rejoiced. As when the shepherd, on the mountain-brow, Sits piping to his flocks and gamesome kids; Meantime the sun, beneath the green earth sunk, Slants upward o'er the scene a parting gleam: Short is the glory that the mountain gilds, Plays on the glittering flocks, and glads the swain; To western worlds irrevocable roll'd, Rapid, the source of light recalls his ray.â Here interposing IââOh, Queen of men! Beneath whose sceptre in essential rights Equal they live; though placed for common good, Various, or in subjection or command; And that by common choice: alas! the scene, With virtue, freedom, and with glory bright, Streams into blood, and darkens into woe.â Thus she pursued:ââNear this great era, Rome Began to feel the swift approach of fate, That now her vitals gain'd: still more and more Her deep divisions kindling into rage, And war with chains and desolation charged. From an unequal balance of her sons These fierce contentions sprung: and, as increased This hated inequality, more fierce They flamed to tumult. Independence fail'd; Here by luxurious wants, by real there; And with this virtue every virtue sunk, As, with the sliding rock, the pile sustain'd. A last attempt, too late, the Gracchi made, To fix the flying scale, and poise the state. On one side swell'd aristocratic Pride; With Usury, the villain! whose fell gripe Bends by degrees to baseness the free soul; And Luxury rapacious, cruel, mean, Mother of vice! While on the other crept A populace in want, with pleasure fired; Fit for proscriptions, for the darkest deeds, As the proud feeder bade; inconstant, blind, Deserting friends at need, and duped by foes; Loud and seditious, when a chief inspired Their headlong fury, but of him deprived, Already slaves that lick'd the scourging hand. âThis firm republic, that against the blast Of opposition rose; that (like an oak, Nursed on ferocious Algidum, A town of Latium, near Tusculum. whose boughs Still stronger shoot beneath the rigid axe,) By loss, by slaughter, from the steel itself, E'en force and spirit drew; smit with the calm, The dead serene of prosperous fortune, pined. Nought now her weighty legions could oppose; Her Carthage. terror once, on Afric's tawny shore, Now smoked in dust, a stabling now for wolves; And every dreaded power received the yoke. Besides, destructive, from the conquer'd East, In the soft plunder came that worst of plagues, That pestilence of mind, a fever'd thirst For the false joys which Luxury prepares. Unworthy joys! that wasteful leave behind No mark of honour, in reflecting hour, No secret ray to glad the conscious soul; At once involving in one ruin wealth, And wealth-acquiring powers: while stupid self, Of narrow gust, and hebetating sense, Devour the nobler faculties of bliss. Hence Roman virtue slacken'd into sloth; Security relax'd the softening state; And the broad eye of government lay closed. No more the laws inviolable reign'd, And public weal no more: but party raged; And partial power, and license unrestrain'd, Let Discord through the deathful city loose. First, mild Tiberius, Tiberius Gracchus. on thy sacred head The fury's vengeance fell; the first, whose blood Had since the consuls stain'd contending Rome. Of precedent pernicious! with thee bled Three hundred Romans; with thy brother, next, Three thousand more: till, into battles turn'd Debates of peace, and forced the trembling laws, The Forum and Comitia horrid grew, A scene of barter'd power, or reeking gore. When, half-ashamed, Corruption's thievish arts, And ruffian force begin to sap the mounds And majesty of laws; if not in time Repress'd severe, for human aid too strong The torrent turns, and overbears the whole. âThus Luxury, Dissension, a mix'd rage Of boundless pleasure and of boundless wealth, Want-wishing change, and waste-repairing war, Rapine for ever lost to peaceful toil, Guilt unatoned, profuse of blood Revenge, Corruption all avow'd, and lawless Force, Each heightening each, alternate shook the state. Meantime Ambition, at the dazzling head Of hardy legions, with the laurels heap'd And spoil of nations, in one circling blast Combined in various storm, and from its base The broad republic tore. By Virtue built It touch'd the skies, and spread o'er shelter'd earth An ample roof: by Virtue too sustain'd, And balanced steady, every tempest sung Innoxious by, or bade it firmer stand. But when, with sudden and enormous change, The first of mankind sunk into the last, As once in Virtue, so in Vice extreme, This universal fabric yielded loose, Before Ambition still; and thundering down, At last, beneath its ruins crush'd a world. A conquering people, to themselves a prey, Must ever fall; when their victorious troops, In blood and rapine savage grown, can find No land to sack and pillage but their own. âBy brutal Marius, and keen Sylla, first Effused the deluge dire of civil blood, Unceasing woes began, and this, or that, Deep-drenching their revenge, nor virtue spared, Nor sex, nor age, nor quality, nor name; Till Rome, into a human shambles turn'd, Made deserts lovely.âOh, to well earn'd chains, Devoted race!âIf no true Roman then, No ScÃ¦vola there was, to raise for me A vengeful hand: was there no father, robb'd Of blooming youth to prop his wither'd age? No son, a witness to his hoary sire In dust and gore defiled? no friend, forlorn? No wretch that doubtful trembled for himself? None brave, or wild, to pierce a monster's heart, Who, heaping horror round, no more deserved The sacred shelter of the laws he spurn'd? No:âSad o'er all profound dejection sat; And nerveless fear. The slave's asylum theirs: Or flight, ill-judging, that the timid back Turns weak to slaughter; or partaken guilt. In vain from Sylla's vanity I drew An unexampled deed. The power resign'd, And all unhoped the commonwealth restored, Amazed the public, and effaced his crimes. Through streets yet streaming from his murderous hand Unarm'd he stray'd, unguarded, unassail'd, And on the bed of peace his ashes laid; A grace, which I to his demission gave. But with him died not the despotic soul. Ambition saw that stooping Rome could bear A master, nor had virtue to be free. Hence, for succeeding years, my troubled reign No certain peace, no spreading prospect knew. Destruction gather'd round. Still the black soul, Or of a Catiline, or Rullus, Publius Servilius Rullus, tribune of the people, proposed an Agrarian Law, in appearance very advantageous for the people, but destructive of their liberty: and which was defeated by the eloquence of Cicero, in his speech against Rullus. swell'd With fell designs; and all the watchful art Of Cicero demanded, all the force, All the state-wielding magic of his tongue; And all the thunder of my Cato's zeal. With these I linger'd; till the flame anew Burst out, in blaze immense, and wrapt the world. The shameful contest sprung; to whom mankind Should yield the neck: to Pompey, who conceal'd A rage impatient of an equal name; Or to the nobler CÃ¦sar, on whose brow O'er daring vice deluding virtue smiled, And who no less a vain superior scorn'd. Both bled, but bled in vain. New traitors rose. The venal will be bought, the base have lords. To these vile wars I left ambitious slaves; And from Philippi's field, from where in dust The last of Romans, matchless Brutus! lay, Spread to the north untamed a rapid wing. âWhat though the first smooth CÃ¦sars arts caress'd, Merit, and virtue, simulating me? Severely tender! cruelly humane! The chain to clinch, and make it softer sit On the new-broken still ferocious state. From the dark Third, Tiberius. succeeding, I beheld The imperial monsters all.âA race on earth Vindictive, sent the scourge of humankind! Whose blind profusion drain'd a bankrupt world; Whose lust to forming nature seems disgrace; And whose infernal rage bade every drop Of ancient blood, that yet retain'd my flame, To that of PÃ¦tus, Thrasea PÃ¦tus, put to death by Nero. Tacitus introduces the account he gives of his death, thus:ââAfter having inhumanly slaughtered so many illustrious men, he (Nero) burned at last with a desire of cutting off virtue itself in the person of Thrasea,â &amp;c. in the peaceful bath, Or Rome's affrighted streets, inglorious flow. But almost just the meanly patient death, That waits a tyrant's unprevented stroke. Titus indeed gave one short evening gleam; More cordial felt, as in the midst it spread Of storm, and horror. The delight of men! He who the day, when his o'erflowing hand Had made no happy heart, concluded lost; Trajan and he, with the mild sire Antoninus Pius, and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, afterwards called Antoninus Philosophus. and son, His son of virtue! eased awhile mankind; And arts revived beneath their gentle beam. Then was their last effort: what sculpture raised To Trajan's glory, following triumphs stole; And mix'd with Gothic forms, (the chisel's shame) On that triumphal arch, Constantine's arch, to build which, that of Trajan was destroyed, sculpture having been then almost entirely lost. the forms of Greece. âMeantime o'er rocky Thrace, and the deep vales Of gelid HÃ¦mus, I pursued my flight; And, piercing farthest Scythia, westward swept Sarmatia, The ancient Sarmatia contained a vast tract of country running all along the north of Europe and Asia. traversed by a thousand streams. A sullen land of lakes, and fens immense, Of rocks, resounding torrents, gloomy heaths, And cruel deserts black with sounding pine; Where nature frowns: though sometimes into smiles She softens; and immediate, at the touch Of southern gales, throws from the sudden glebe Luxuriant pasture, and a waste of flowers. But, cold-compress'd, when the whole loaded heaven Descends in snow, lost in one white abrupt, Lies undistinguish'd earth; and, seized by frost, Lakes, headlong streams, and floods, and oceans sleep. Yet there life glows; the furry millions there Deep dig their dens beneath the sheltering snows: And there a race of men prolific swarms, To various pain, to little pleasure used; On whom, keen-parching, beat RiphÃ¦an winds; Hard like their soil, and like their climate fierce, The nursery of nations!âThese I roused, Drove land on land, on people people pour'd; Till from almost perpetual night they broke, As if in search of day; and o'er the banks Of yielding empire, only slave-sustain'd, Resistless raged; in vengeance urged by me. âLong in the barbarous heart the buried seeds Of Freedom lay, for many a wintry age; And though my spirit work'd, by slow degrees, Nought but its pride and fierceness yet appear'd. Then was the night of time, that parted worlds. I quitted earth the while. As when the tribes AÃ«rial, warn'd of rising winter, ride Autumnal winds, to warmer climates borne; So, arts and each good genius in my train, I cut the closing gloom, and soar'd to Heaven. âIn the bright regions there of purest day, Far other scenes, and palaces, arise, Adorn'd profuse with other arts divine. All beauty here below, to them compared, Would, like a rose before the midday sun, Shrink up its blossom; like a bubble break The passing poor magnificence of kings. For there the King of Nature, in full blaze, Calls every splendour forth; and there his court, Amid ethereal powers, and virtues, holds: Angel, archangel, tutelary gods, Of cities, nations, empires, and of worlds. But sacred be the veil, that kindly clouds A light too keen for mortals; wraps a view Too softening fair, for those that here in dust Must cheerful toil out their appointed years. A sense of higher life would only damp The schoolboy's task, and spoil his playful hours. Nor could the child of Reason, feeble man, With vigour through this infant-being drudge; Did brighter worlds, their unimagined bliss Disclosing, dazzle and dissolve his mind.â PART IV. BRITAIN. CONTENTS. Difference betwixt the Ancients and Moderns slightly touched upon. Description of the dark ages. The Goddess of Liberty, who during these is supposed to have left earth, returns, attended with Arts and Science. She first descends on Italy. Sculpture, Painting, and Architecture fix at Rome, to revive their several arts by the great models of antiquity there, which many barbarous invasions had not been able to destroy. The revival of these arts marked out. That sometimes arts may flourish for a while under despotic governments, though never the natural and genuine production of them. Learning begins to dawn. The Muse and Science attend Liberty, who in her progress towards Great Britain raises several free states and cities. These enumerated. Author's exclamation of joy, upon seeing the British seas and coasts rise in the vision, which painted whatever the Goddess of Liberty said. She resumes her narration. The Genius of the Deep appears, and addressing Liberty, associates Great Britain into his dominion. Liberty received and congratulated by Britannia, and the Native Genii or Virtues of the island. These described. Animated by the presence of Liberty, they begin their operations. Their beneficent influence contrasted with the works and delusions of opposing Demons. Concludes with an abstract of the English history, marking the several Advances of Liberty, down to her complete establishment at the Revolution. Struck with the rising scene, thus I amazed: âAh, Goddess, what a change! is earth the same? Of the same kind the ruthless race she feeds? And does the same fair sun and ether spread Round this vile spot their all-enlivening soul? Lo! beauty fails; lost in unlovely forms Of little pomp, magnificence no more Exalts the mind, and bids the public smile: While to rapicious interest Glory leaves Mankind, and every grace of life is gone.â To this the Power, whose vital radiance calls From the brute mass of man an order'd world: âWait till the morning shines, and from the depth Of Gothic darkness springs another day. True, Genius droops; the tender ancient taste Of Beauty, then fresh blooming in her prime, But faintly trembles through the callous soul; And Grandeur, or of morals, or of life, Sinks into safe pursuits, and creeping cares. E'en cautious Virtue seems to stoop her flight, And aged life to deem the generous deeds Of youth romantic. Yet in cooler thought Well reason'd, in researches piercing deep Through nature's works, in profitable arts, And all that calm Experience can disclose, (Slow guide, but sure), behold the world anew Exalted rise, with other honours crown'd; And, where my Spirit wakes the finer powers, Athenian laurels still afresh shall bloom. âOblivious ages pass'd; while earth, forsook By her best Genii, lay to Demons foul, And unchain'd Furies, an abandon'd prey. Contention led the van; first small of size, But soon dilating to the skies she towers: Then, wide as air, the livid Fury spread, And high her head above the stormy clouds, She blazed in omens, swell'd the groaning winds With wild surmises, battlings, sounds of war: From land to land the maddening trumpet blew, And pour'd her venom through the heart of man. Shook to the pole, the North obey'd her call. Forth rush'd the bloody power of Gothic war, War against human kind: Rapine, that led Millions of raging robbers in his train: Unlistening, barbarous Force, to whom the sword Is reason, honour, law: the foe of arts By monsters follow'd, hideous to behold, That claim'd their place. Outrageous mix'd with these Another species of tyrannic Church power, or ecclesiastical tyranny. rule, Unknown before, whose cankerous shackles seized The envenom'd soul; a wilder Fury, she Even o'er her Elder Sister Civil tyranny. tyrannized; Or, if perchance agreed, inflamed her rage. Dire was her train, and loud: the sable band, Thundering;ââSubmit, ye Laity! ye profane! Earth is the Lord's, and therefore ours; let kings Allow the common claim, and half be theirs; If not, behold! the sacred lightning flies!â Scholastic Discord, with a hundred tongues, For science uttering jangling words obscure, Where frighted reason never yet could dwell: Of peremptory feature, cleric Pride, Whose reddening cheek no contradiction bears; And holy Slander, his associate firm, On whom the lying Spirit still descends: Mother of tortures! persecuting Zeal, High flashing in her hand the ready torch, Or poniard bathed in unbelieving blood; Hell's fiercest fiend! of saintly brow demure, Assuming a celestial seraph's name, While she beneath the blasphemous pretence Of pleasing Parent Heaven, the Source of Love! Has wrought more horrors, more detested deeds, Than all the rest combined. Led on by her, And wild of head to work her fell designs, Came idiot superstition; round with ears Innumerous strow'd, ten thousand monkish forms With legends ply'd them, and with tenets, meant To charm or scare the simple into slaves, And poison reason; gross, she swallows all, The most absurd believing ever most. Broad o'er the whole her universal night, The gloom still doubling, Ignorance diffused. âNought to be seen, but visionary monks To councils strolling, and embroiling creeds; Banditti Saints, Crusades. disturbing distant lands; And unknown nations, wandering for a home. All lay reversed: the sacred arts of rule Turn'd to flagitious leagues against mankind, And arts of plunder more and more avow'd; Pure plain Devotion The corruptions of the church of Rome. to a solemn farce; To holy dotage Virtue, even to guile, To murder, and a mockery of oaths; Brave ancient Freedom to the rage of slaves, Vassalage, whence the attachment of clans to their chief. Proud of their state, and fighting for their chains; Dishonour'd Courage to the bravo's trade, Duelling. To civil broil; and Glory to romance. Thus human life, unhinged, to ruin reel'd, And giddy Reason totter'd on her throne. âAt last Heaven's best inexplicable scheme, Disclosing, bade new brightening eras smile. The high command gone forth, Arts in my train, And azure-mantled Science, swift we spread A sounding pinion. Eager pity, mix'd With indignation, urged her downward flight. On Latium first we stoop'd, for doubtful life That panted, sunk beneath unnumber'd woes. Ah, poor Italia! what a bitter cup Of vengeance hast thou drain'd? Goths, Vandals, Huns, Lombards, barbarians broke from every land, How many a ruffian form hast thou beheld? What horrid jargons heard, where rage alone Was all thy frighted ear could comprehend? How frequent by the red inhuman hand, Yet warm with brother's, husband's, father's blood, Hast thou thy matrons and thy virgins seen To violation dragg'd, and mingled death? What conflagrations, earthquakes, ravage, floods, Have turn'd thy cities into stony wilds; And succourless, and bare, the poor remains Of wretches forth to Nature's common cast? Added to these the still continued waste Of inbred foes that on thy vitals prey, The Hierarchy. And, double tyrants, seize the very soul. Where hadst thou treasures for this rapine all? These hungry myriads, that thy bowels tore, Heap'd sack on sack, and buried in their rage Wonders of art; whence this grey scene, a mine Of more than gold becomes and orient gems, Where Egypt, Greece, and Rome united glow. âHere Sculpture, Painting, Architecture, bent From ancient models to restore their arts, Remain'd. A little trace we how they rose. âAmid the hoary ruins, Sculpture first, Deep digging, from the cavern dark and damp, Their grave for ages, bid her marble race Spring to new light. Joy sparkled in her eyes, And old remembrance thrill'd in every thought, As she the pleasing resurrection saw. In leaning site, respiring from his toils, The well known Hero, The Hercules of Farnese. who deliver'd Greece, His ample chest, all tempested with force, Unconquerable rear'd. She saw the head, Breathing the hero, small, of Grecian size, Scarce more extensive than the sinewy neck: The spreading shoulders, muscular, and broad; The whole a mass of swelling sinews, touch'd Into harmonious shape; she saw, and joy'd. The yellow hunter, Meleager, raised His beauteous front, and through the finish'd whole Shows what ideas smiled of old in Greece. Of raging aspect, rush'd impetuous forth The Gladiator: Fighting Gladiator. pitiless his look, And each keen sinew braced, the storm of war, Ruffling, o'er all his nervous body frowns. The dying other Dying Gladiator. from the gloom she drew: Supported on his shorten'd arm he leans, Prone, agonizing; with incumbent fate, Heavy declines his head; yet dark beneath The suffering feature sullen vengeance lours, Shame, indignation, unaccomplish'd rage, And still the cheated eye expects his fall. All conquest-flush'd, from prostrate Python, came The quiver'd God. Apollo of Belvidere.

Goddess, forgive!âMy heart, surprised, o'erflows With filial fondness for the land you bless.â As parents to a child complacent deign Approvance, the celestial brightness smiled; Then thusââAs o'er the wave resounding deep, To my near reign, the happy isle, I steer'd With easy wing; behold! from surge to surge, Stalk'd the tremendous Genius of the Deep. Around him clouds, in mingled tempest, hung; Thick flashing meteors crown'd his starry head; And ready thunder reddened in his hand, Or from it stream'd compress'd the gloomy cloud. Where'er he look'd, the trembling waves recoil'd. He needs but strike the conscious flood, and shook From shore to shore, in agitation dire, It works his dreadful will. To me his voice (Like that hoarse blast that round the cavern howls, Mix'd with the murmurs of the falling main,) Address'd, beganââBy Fate commission'd, go, My Sister-Goddess now, to yon bless'd isle, Henceforth the partner of my rough domain. All my dread walks to Britons open lie. Those that refulgent, or with rosy morn, Or yellow evening, flame; those that, profuse, Drunk by equator suns, severely shine; Or those that, to the poles approaching, rise In billows rolling into Alps of ice. E'en, yet untouch'd by daring keel, be theirs The vast Pacific; that on other worlds, Their future conquest, rolls resounding tides. Long I maintain'd inviolate my reign; Nor Alexanders me, nor CÃ¦sars braved. Still, in the crook of shore, the coward sail Till now low crept; and peddling commerce ply'd Between near joining lands. For Britons, chief, It was reserved, with star-directed prow, To dare the middle deep, and drive assured To distant nations through the pathless main. Chief, for their fearless hearts the glory waits, Long months from land, while the black stormy night Around them rages, on the groaning mast With unshook knee to know their giddy way; To sing, unquell'd, amid the lashing wave; To laugh at danger. Theirs the triumph be, By deep Invention's keen pervading eye, The heart of Courage, and the hand of Toil, Each conquer'd ocean staining with their blood, Instead of treasure robb'd by ruffian war, Round social earth to circle fair exchange, And bind the nations in a golden chain. To these I honour'd stoop. Rushing to light A race of men behold! whose daring deeds Will in renown exalt my nameless plains O'er those of fabling earth, as hers to mine In terror yield. Nay, could my savage heart Such glories check, their unsubmitting soul Would all my fury brave, my tempest climb, And might in spite of me my kingdom force.â Here, waiting no reply, the shadowy power Eased the dark sky, and to the deeps return'd: While the loud thunder rattling from his hand, Auspicious, shook opponent Gallia's shore. âOf this encounter glad, my way to land I quick pursued, that from the smiling sea Received me joyous. Loud acclaims were heard; And music, more than mortal, warbling, fill'd With pleased astonishment the labouring hind, Who for a while the unfinish'd furrow left, And let the listening steer forget his toil. Unseen by grosser eye, Britannia breathed, And her aÃ«rial train, these sounds of joy. For of old time, since first the rushing flood, Urged by almighty power, this favour'd isle Turn'd flashing from the continent aside, Indented shore to shore responsive still, Its guardian sheâthe Goddess, whose staid eye Beams the dark azure of the doubtful dawn. Her tresses, like a flood of soften'd light Through clouds imbrown'd, in waving circles play. Warm on her cheek sits Beauty's brightest rose, Of high demeanour, stately, shedding grace With every motion. Full her rising chest; And new ideas, from her finish'd shape, Charm'd Sculpture taking might improve her art. Such the fair Guardian of an isle that boasts, Profuse as vernal blooms, the fairest dames. High shining on the promontory's brow, Awaiting me, she stood; with hope inflamed, By my mixed spirit burning in her sons, To firm, to polish, and exalt the state. âThe native Genii, round her, radiant smiled. Courage, of soft deportment, aspect calm, Unboastful, suffering long, and, till provoked, As mild and harmless as the sporting child; But, on just reason, once his fury roused, No lion springs more eager to his prey: Blood is a pastime; and his heart, elate, Knows no depressing fear. That Virtue known By the relenting look, whose equal heart For others feels, as for another self: Of various name, as various objects wake, Warm into action, the kind sense within: Whether the blameless poor, the nobly maim'd, The lost to reason, the declined in life, The helpless young that kiss no mother's hand, And the grey second infancy of age, She gives in public families to live, A sight to gladden Heaven! whether she stands Fair beckoning at the hospitable gate, And bids the stranger take repose and joy: Whether, to solace honest labour, she Rejoices those that make the land rejoice: Or whether to Philosophy, and Arts, (At once the basis and the finish'd pride Of government and life) she spreads her hand; Nor knows her gift profuse, nor seems to know, Doubling her bounty, that she gives at all. Justice to these her awful presence join'd, The mother of the state! no low revenge, No turbid passions in her breast ferment: Tender, serene, compassionate of vice, As the last woe that can afflict mankind, She punishment awards; yet of the good More piteous still, and of the suffering whole, Awards it firm. So fair her just decree, That, in his judging peers, each on himself Pronounces his own doom. O happy land! Where reigns alone this justice of the free! Mid the bright group Sincerity his front, Diffusive, rear'd; his pure untroubled eye The fount of truth. The thoughtful Power, apart, Now, pensive, cast on earth his fix'd regard, Now, touch'd celestial, launch'd it on the sky. The Genius he whence Britain shines supreme, The land of light, and rectitude of mind. He, too, the fire of fancy feeds intense, With all the train of passions thence derived: Not kindling quick, a noisy transient blaze, But gradual, silent, lasting, and profound. Near him Retirement, pointing to the shade, And Independence stood: the generous pair, That simple life, the quiet-whispering grove, And the still raptures of the free-born soul, To cates prefer by Virtue bought, not earn'd, Proudly prefer them to the servile pomp, And to the heart-embitter'd joys of slaves. Or should the latter, to the public scene Demanded, quit his silvan friend awhile; Nought can his firmness shake, nothing seduce His zeal, still active for the commonweal; Nor stormy tyrants, nor corruption's tools, Foul ministers, dark-working by the force Of secret-sapping gold. All their vile arts, Their shameful honours, their perfidious gifts, He greatly scorns; and, if he must betray His plunder'd country, or his power resign, A moment's parley were eternal shame: Illustrious into private life again, From dirty levees he unstain'd ascends, And firm in senates stands the patriot's ground, Or draws new vigour in the peaceful shade. Aloof the bashful virtue hover'd coy, Proving by sweet distrust distrusted worth. Rough Labour closed the train: and in his hand Rude, callous, sinew-swell'd, and black with toil, Came manly Indignation. Sour he seems, And more than seems, by lawless pride assail'd; Yet kind at heart, and just, and generous, there No vengeance lurks, no pale insidious gall: Even in the very luxury of rage, He softening can forgive a gallant foe; The nerve, support, and glory of the land! Nor be Religion, rational and free, Here pass'd in silence; whose enraptured eye Sees Heaven with earth connected, human things Link'd to divine: who not from servile fear, By rights for some weak tyrant incense fit, The God of Love adores, but from a heart Effusing gladness, into pleasing awe That now astonish'd swells, now in a calm Of fearless confidence that smiles serene; That lives devotion, one continual hymn, And then most grateful, when Heaven's bounty most Is right enjoy'd. This ever cheerful Power O'er the raised circle ray'd superior day. âI joy'd to join the Virtues, whence my reign O'er Albion was to rise. Each cheering each, And, like the circling planets from the sun, All borrowing beams from me, a heighten'd zeal Impatient fired us to commence our toils, Or pleasures rather. Long the pungent time Pass'd not in mutual hails; but, through the land Darting our light, we shone the fogs away. âThe Virtues conquer with a single look. Such grace, such beauty, such victorious light, Live in their presence, stream in every glance, That the soul won, enamour'd, and refined, Grows their own image, pure ethereal flame. Hence the foul Demons, that oppose our reign, Would still from us deluded mortals wrap; Or in gross shades they drown the visual ray, Or by the fogs of prejudice, where mix Falsehood and truth confounded, foil the sense With vain refracted images of bliss. But chief around the court of flatter'd kings They roll the dusky rampart, wall o'er wall Of darkest pile, and with their thickest shade Secure the throne. No savage Alp, the den Of wolves, and bears, and monstrous things obscene, That vex the swain and waste the country round, Protected lies beneath a deeper cloud. Yet there we sometimes send a searching ray, As, at the sacred opening of the morn, The prowling race retire; so, pierced severe, Before our potent blaze these Demons fly, And all their works dissolveâthe whisper'd tale, That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows. Fair-faced Deceit, whose wily conscious eye Ne'er looks direct. The tongue that licks the dust, But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting: Smooth crocodile Destruction, whose fell tears Ensnare. The Janus-face of courtly Pride; One to superiors heaves submissive eyes, On hapless worth the other scowls disdain: Cheeks that for some weak tenderness, alone, Some virtuous slip, can wear a blush. The laugh Profane, when midnight bowls disclose the heart, At starving Virtue, and at Virtue's fools. Determined to be broke, the plighted faith; Nay more, the godless oath, that knows no ties. Soft-buzzing Slander; silky moths, that eat An honest name. The harpy hand, and maw, Of avaricious Luxury; who makes The throne his shelter, venal laws his fort, And, his service, who betrays his king. âNow turn your view, and mark from Celtic Great Britain was peopled by the CeltÃ¦ or Gauls. night To present grandeur how my Britain rose. âBold were those Britons, who, the careless sons Of Nature, roam'd the forest-bounds, at once Their verdant city, high-embowering fane, And the gay circle of their woodland wars: For by the Druid The Druids, among the ancient Gauls and Britons, had the care and direction of all religious matters. taught, that death but shifts The vital scene, they that prime fear despised; And, prone to rush on steel, disdain'd to spare An ill saved life that must again return.

On the contrary, all who gave themselves to warlike actions and enterprises, to the conquest of their neighbours and the slaughter of their enemies, and died in battle, or of violent deaths upon bold adventures or resolutions, went immediately to the vast hall or palace of Odin, their god of war, who eternally kept open house for all such guests, where they were entertained at infinite tables, in perpetual feasts and mirth, carousing in bowls made of the skulls of their enemies they had slain; according to the number of whom, every one in these mansions of pleasure was the most honoured and best entertained.

Till then, history makes no mention of them; whence a very strong argument may be drawn, to fix the original of the House of Commons to that era. rose The fort of Freedom! Slow till then, alone, Had work'd that general liberty, that soul Which generous nature breathes, and which, when left By me to bondage, was corrupted Rome, I through the northern nations wide diffused. Hence many a people, fierce with freedom, rush'd From the rude iron regions of the North, To Libyan deserts swarm protruding swarm, And pour'd new spirit through a slavish world. Yet, o'er these Gothic states, the King and Chiefs Retain'd the high prerogative of war, And with enormous property engross'd The mingled power. But on Britannia's shore Now present, I to raise my reign began By raising the Democracy, the third And broadest bulwark of the guarded state. Then was the full the perfect plan disclosed Of Britain's matchless constitution, mix'd Of mutual checking and supporting powers, King, Lords, and Commons; nor the name of free Deserving, while the vassal-many droop'd: For since the moment of the whole they form, So, as depress'd or raised, the balance they Of public welfare and of glory cast. Mark from this period the continual proof. âWhen Kings of narrow genius, minion-rid, Neglecting faithful worth for fawning slaves; Proudly regardless of their people's plaints, And poorly passive of insulting foes; Double, not prudent, obstinate, not firm, Their mercy fear, necessity their faith; Instead of generous fire, presumptuous, hot, Rash to resolve, and slothful to perform; Tyrants at once and slaves, imperious, mean, To want rapacious joining shameful waste; By counsels weak and wicked, easy roused To paltry schemes of absolute command, To seek their splendour in their sure disgrace, And in a broken ruin'd people wealth: When such o'ercast the state, no bond of love, No heart, no soul, no unity, no nerve, Combined the loose disjointed public, lost To fame abroad, to happiness at home. âBut when an Edward, Edward III. and a Henry Henry V. breathed Through the charm'd whole one all-exerting soul: Drawn sympathetic from his dark retreat, When wide-attracted merit round them glow'd: Then counsels just, extensive, generous, firm, Amid the maze of state, determined kept Some ruling point in view: when, on the stock Of public good and glory grafted, spread Their palms, their laurels; or, if thence they stray'd, Swift to return, and patient of restraint: When regal state, pre-eminence of place, They scorn'd to deem pre-eminence of ease, To be luxurious drones, that only rob The busy hive: as in distinction, power, Indulgence, honour, and advantage, first; When they too claim'd in virtue, danger, toil, Superior rank; with equal hand, prepared To guard the subject, and to quell the foe: When such with me their vital influence shed, No mutter'd grievance, hopeless sigh, was heard; No foul distrust through wary senates ran, Confined their bounty, and their ardour quench'd: On aid, unquestion'd liberal aid was given: Safe in their conduct, by their valour fired, Fond where they led victorious armies rush'd; And Cressy, Poitiers, Agincourt The famous battles, gained by the English over the French. proclaim What Kings supported by almighty Love, And People fired with Liberty, can do. âBe veil'd the savage reigns, During the civil wars, betwixt the families of York and Lancaster. when kindred rage The numerous once Plantagenets devour'd, A race to vengeance vow'd! and, when oppress'd By private feuds, almost extinguish'd lay My quivering flame. But, in the next, behold! A cautious tyrant Henry VII. lend it oil anew. âProud, dark, suspicious, brooding o'er his gold, As how to fix his throne he jealous cast His crafty views around; pierced with a ray, Which on his timid mind I darted full, He mark'd the Barons of excessive sway, At pleasure making and unmaking kings; The famous Earl of Warwick, during the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV. was called the âKing Maker.â And hence, to crush these petty tyrants, plann'd A law, Permitting the Barons to alienate their lands. that let them, by the silent waste Of luxury, their landed wealth diffuse, And with that wealth their implicated power. By soft degrees a mighty change ensued, E'en working to this day. With streams, deduced From these diminish'd floods, the country smiled. As when impetuous from the snow-heap'd Alps, To vernal suns relenting, pours the Rhine; While, undivided, oft, with wasteful sweep, He foams along; but through Batavian meads, Branch'd into fair canals, indulgent flows; Waters a thousand fields; and culture, trade, Towns, meadows, gliding ships, and villas mix'd, A rich, a wondrous landscape rises round. His furious son Henry VIII. the soul-enslaving chain, Of papal dominion. Which many a doting venerable age Had link by link strong twisted round the land, Shook off. No longer could be borne a power, From Heaven pretended, to deceive, to void Each solemn tie, to plunder without bounds, To curb the generous soul, to fool mankind; And, wild at last, to plunge into a sea Of blood and horror. The returning light, That first through Wickliff John Wickliff, doctor of divinity, who, towards the close of the fourteenth century, published doctrines very contrary to those of the church of Rome, and particularly denying the papal authority. His followers grew very numerous, and were called Lollards. streak'd the priestly gloom, Now burst in open day. Bared to the blaze, Forth from the haunts of Superstition Suppression of monasteries. crawled Her motley sons, fantastic figures all; And, wide dispersed, their useless fetid wealth In graceful labour bloom'd, and fruits of peace. âTrade, join'd to these, on every sea display'd A daring canvass, pour'd with every tide A golden flood. From other worlds The Spanish West Indies. were roll'd The guilty glittering stores, whose fatal charms, By the plain Indian happily despised, Yet work'd his woe; and to the blissful groves, Where Nature lived herself among her sons, And Innocence and Joy for ever dwelt, Drew rage unknown to pagan climes before, The worst the zeal-inflamed barbarian drew. Be no such horrid commerce, Britain, thine! But want for want, with mutual aid, supply. âThe Commons thus enrich'd, and powerful grown, Against the Barons weigh'd. Eliza then, Amid these doubtful motions, steady, gave The beam to fix. She! like the secret Eye, That never closes on a guarded world, So sought, so mark'd, so seized the public good, That self-supported, without one ally, She awed her inward, quell'd her circling foes. Inspired by me, beneath her sheltering arm, In spite of raging universal sway The dominion of the house of Austria. And raging seas repress'd, the Belgic states, My bulwark on the continent, arose. Matchless in all the spirit of her days! With confidence, unbounded, fearless love Elate, her fervent people waited gay, Cheerful demanded the long threaten'd fleet, The Spanish Armada. Rapin says, that after proper measures had been taken, the enemy was expected with uncommon alacrity. And dash'd the pride of Spain around their isle. Nor ceased the British thunder here to rage: The deep, reclaim'd, obey'd its awful call; In fire and smoke Iberian ports involved, The trembling foe even to the centre shook Of their new conquer'd world, and, skulking, stole By veering winds their Indian treasure home. Meantime, Peace, Plenty, Justice, Science, Arts, With softer laurels crown'd her happy reign. As yet uncircumscribed the regal power, And wild and vague prerogative remain'd; A wide voracious gulf, where swallow'd oft The helpless subject lay. This to reduce To the just limit was my great effort. âBy means that evil seem to narrow man, Superior Beings work their mystic will: From storm and trouble thus a settled calm, At last, effulgent, o'er Britannia smiled. âThe gathering tempest, Heaven-commission'd, came, Came in the prince, James I. who, drunk with flattery, dreamt His vain pacific counsels ruled the world; Though scorn'd abroad, bewilder'd in a maze Of fruitless treaties; while at home enslaved, And by a worthless crew insatiate drain'd, He lost his people's confidence and love: Irreparable loss! whence crowns become An anxious burden. Years inglorious pass'd: Triumphant Spain the vengeful draught enjoy'd: Abandon'd Frederick Elector Palatine, and who had been chosen King of Bohemia, but was stripped of all his dominions and dignities by the Emperor Ferdinand, while James the First, his father-in-law, being amused from time to time, endeavoured to mediate a peace. pined, and Raleigh bled. But nothing that to these internal broils, That rancour, he began; while lawless sway He, with his slavish Doctors, tried to rear On metaphysic, The monstrous and till then unheard-of doctrines of divine indefeasible hereditary right, passive obedience, &amp;c. on enchanted ground, And all the mazy quibbles of the schools: As if for one, and sometimes for the worst, Heaven had mankind in vengeance only made. Vain the pretence! not so the dire effect, The fierce, the foolish discord The parties of Whig and Tory. thence derived, That tears the country still, by party rage And ministerial clamour kept alive. In action weak, and for the wordy war Best fitted, faint this prince pursued his claim: Content to teach the subject herd, how great, How sacred he! how despicable they! âBut his unyielding son Charles I. these doctrines drank, With all a bigot's rage; (who never damps By reasoning his fire) and what they taught, Warm, and tenacious, into practice push'd. Senates, in vain, their kind restraint applied: The more they struggled to support the laws, His justice-dreading ministers the more Drove him beyond their bounds. Tired with the check Of faithful Love, and with the flattery pleased Of false designing Guilt, the fountain Parliaments. he Of Public Wisdom and of Justice shut. Wide mourn'd the land. Straight to the voted aid Free, cordial, large, of never failing source, The illegal imposition follow'd harsh, With execration given, or ruthless squeezed From an insulted people, by a band Of the worst ruffians, those of tyrant power. Oppression walk'd at large, and pour'd abroad Her unrelenting train: informers, spies, Bloodhounds, that sturdy Freedom to the grove Pursue; projectors of aggrieving schemes, Commerce to load for unprotected seas, Ship-money. To sell the starving many to the few, Monopolies. And drain a thousand ways the exhausted land, E'en from that place, whence healing Peace should flow, And Gospel truth, inhuman bigots shed Their poison The raging High-Church sermons of these times, inspiring a spirit of slavish submission to the court, and of bitter persecution against those whom they call Church and State Puritans. round; and on the venal bench, Instead of justice, party held the scale, And violence the sword. Afflicted years, Too patient, felt at last their vengeance full. âMid the low murmurs of submissive fear And mingled rage, my Hambden raised his voice, And to the laws appeal'd; the laws no more In judgment sat, behoved some other ear. When instant from the keen resentive North, By long oppression, by religion roused, The guardian army came. Beneath its wing Was call'd, though meant to furnish hostile aid, The more than Roman senate. There a flame Broke out, that clear'd, consumed, renew'd the land. In deep emotion hurl'd, nor Greece, nor Rome, Indignant bursting from a tyrant's chain, While, full of me, each agitated soul Strung every nerve and flamed in every eye, Had e'er beheld such light and heat combined! Such heads and hearts! such dreadful zeal, led on By calm majestic wisdom, taught its course What nuisance to devour; such wisdom fired With unabating zeal, and aim'd sincere To clear the weedy state, restore the laws, And for the future to secure their sway. âThis then the purpose of my mildest sons. But man is blind. A nation once inflamed (Chief, should the breath of factious fury blow, With the wild rage of mad enthusiast swell'd) Not easy cools again. From breast to breast, From eye to eye, the kindling passions mix In heighten'd blaze; and, ever wise and just, High Heaven to gracious ends directs the storm. Thus in one conflagration Britain wrapt, And by Confusion's lawless sons despoil'd, King, Lords, and Commons, thundering to the ground, Successive, rush'dâLo! from their ashes rose, Gay beaming radiant youth, the PhÅnix State. At the Restoration. âThe grievous yoke of vassalage, the yoke Of private life, lay by those flames dissolved; And, from the wasteful, the luxurious king, Charles II. Was purchased Court of Wards. that which taught the young to bend. Stronger restored, the Commons tax'd the whole, And built on that eternal rock their power. The Crown, of its hereditary wealth Despoil'd, on senates more dependent grew, And they more frequent, more assured. Yet lived, And in full vigour spread that bitter root, The passive doctrines, by their patrons first, Opposed ferocious, when they touch themselves. âThis wild delusive cant; the rash cabal Of hungry courtiers, ravenous for prey; The bigot, restless in a double chain To bind anew the land; the constant need Of finding faithless means, of shifting forms, And flattering senates, to supply his waste; These tore some moments from the careless prince, And in his breast awaked the kindred plan. By dangerous softness long he mined his way; By subtle arts, dissimulation deep; By sharing what corruption shower'd, profuse; By breathing wide the gay licentious plague, And pleasing manners, fitted to deceive. âAt last subsided the delirious joy, On whose high billow, from the saintly reign, The nation drove too far. A pension'd king, Against his country bribed by Gallic gold; The Port Dunkirk. pernicious sold, the Scylla since And fell Charybdis of the British seas; Freedom attack'd abroad, The war in conjunction with France, against the Dutch. with surer blow To cut it off at home; the saviour league The Triple Alliance. Of Europe broke; the progress e'en advanced Of universal sway, Under Lewis XIV. which to reduce Such seas of blood and treasure Britain cost; The millions, by a generous people given, Or squander'd vile, or to corrupt, disgrace, And awe the land with forces A standing army, raised without the consent of parliament. not their own. Employ'd; the darling church herself betray'd; All these, broad glaring, oped the general eye, And waked my spirit, the resisting soul. âMild was, at first, and half ashamed, the check Of senates, shook from the fantastic dream Of absolute submission, tenets vile! Which slaves would blush to own, and which reduced To practice, always honest nature shock. Not e'en the mask removed, and the fierce front Of tyranny disclosed; nor trampled laws; Nor seized each badge of freedom The charters of corporations. through the land; Nor Sidney bleeding for the unpublish'd page; Nor on the bench avowed corruption placed, And murderous rage itself, in Jefferies' form; Judge Jefferies. Nor endless acts of arbitrary power, Cruel, and false, could raise the public arm. Distrustful, scatter'd, of combining chiefs Devoid, and dreading blind rapacious war, The patient public turns not, till impell'd To the near verge of ruin. Hence I roused The bigot king, James II. and hurried fated on His measures immature. But chief his zeal, Out-flaming Rome herself, portentous scared The troubled nation: Mary's horrid days To fancy bleeding rose, and the dire glare Of Smithfield lighten'd in its eyes anew. Yet silence reign'd. Each on another scowl'd Rueful amazement, pressing down his rage: As, mustering vengeance, the deep thunder frowns, Awfully still, waiting the high command To spring. Straight from his country Europe saved, To save Britannia, lo! my darling son, Than hero more! the patriot of mankind! Immortal Nassau came. I hush'd the deep By demons roused, and bade the listed winds, The Prince of Orange, in his passage to England, though his fleet had been at first dispersed by a storm, was afterwards extremely favoured by several changes of wind. Still shifting as behoved, with various breath, Waft the deliverer to the longing shore. See! wide alive, the foaming channel Rapin, in his History of England.âThe third of November the fleet entered the Channel, and lay by between Calais and Dover, to stay for the ships that were behind. Here the Prince called a council of war. It is easy to imagine what a glorious show the fleet made. Five or six hundred ships in so narrow a channel, and both the English and French shores covered with numberless spectators, are no common sight. For my part, who was then on board the fleet, I own it struck me extremely. bright With swelling sails, and all the pride of war, Delightful view! when justice draws the sword: And mark! diffusing ardent soul around, And sweet contempt of death, My streaming flag. The Prince placed himself in the main body, carrying a flag with English colours, and their highnesses' arms surrounded with this motto, âThe Protestant Religion and the Liberties of England;â and underneath the motto of the house of Nassau, âJe Maintiendrai, I will maintain. âRapin. E'en adverse navies The English fleet. bless'd the binding gale, Kept down the glad acclaim, and silent joy'd. Arrived, the pomp, and not the waste of arms His progress mark'd. The faint opposing host The king's army. For once, in yielding their best victory found, And by desertion proved exalted faith: While his the bloodless conquest of the heart, Shouts without groan, and triumph without war. âThen dawn'd the period destined to confine The surge of wild prerogative, to raise A mound restraining its imperious rage, And bid the raving deep no farther flow. Nor were, without that fence, the swallow'd state Better than Belgian plains without their dykes, Sustaining weighty seas. This, often saved By more than human hand, the public saw, And seized the white-wing'd moment. Pleased By the Bill of Rights and the Act of Succession. to yield Destructive power, a wise heroic prince William III. E'en lent his aidâThrice happy! did they know Their happiness, Britannia's bounded kings. What though not theirs the boast, in dungeon glooms, To plunge bold freedom; or, to cheerless wilds, To drive him from the cordial face of friend; Or fierce to strike him at the midnight hour, By mandate blind, not justice, that delights To dare the keenest eye of open day. What though no glory to control the laws, And make injurious will their only rule, They deem it. What though, tools of wanton power, Pestiferous armies swarm not at their call. What though they give not a relentless crew Of civil furies, proud oppression's fangs! To tear at pleasure the dejected land, With starving labour pampering idle waste. To clothe the naked, feed the hungry, wipe The guiltless tear from lone affliction's eye; To raise hid merit, set the alluring light Of virtue high to view; to nourish arts, Direct the thunder of an injured state, Make a whole glorious people sing for joy, Bless humankind, and through the downward depth Of future times to spread that better sun Which lights up British soul: for deeds like these, The dazzling fair career unbounded lies; While (still superior bliss!) the dark abrupt Is kindly barr'd, the precipice of ill. O luxury divine! O poor to this, Ye giddy glories of despotic thrones! By this, by this indeed, is imaged Heaven, By boundless good without the power of ill. âAnd now behold! exalted as the cope That swells immense o'er many-peopled earth, And like it free, my fabric stands complete, The palace of the laws. To the four heavens Four gates impartial thrown, unceasing crowds, With kings themselves the hearty peasant mix'd, Pour urgent in. And though to different ranks Responsive place belongs, yet equal spreads The sheltering roof o'er all; while plenty flows, And glad contentment echoes round the whole. Ye floods, descend! Ye winds, confirming, blow! Nor outward tempest, nor corrosive time, Nought but the felon undermining hand Of dark Corruption, can its frame dissolve, And lay the toil of ages in the dust.â PART V. THE PROSPECT. CONTENTS. The author addresses the Goddess of Liberty, marking the happiness and grandeur of Great Britain, as arising from her influence. She resumes her discourse, and points out the chief Virtues which are necessary to maintain her establishment there. Recommends, as its last ornament and finishing, Sciences, Fine Arts, and Public Works. The encouragement of these urged from the example of France, though under a despotic government. The whole concludes with a prospect of future times, given by the Goddess of Liberty: this described by the author, as it passes in vision before him. Here interposing, as the Goddess paused;â âO bless'd Britannia! in thy presence bless'd, Thou guardian of mankind! whence spring, alone, All human grandeur, happiness, and fame; For toil, by thee protected, feels no pain; The poor man's lot with milk and honey flows; And, gilded with thy rays, even death looks gay. Let other lands the potent blessings boast Of more exalting suns. Let Asia's woods, Untended, yield the vegetable fleece: And let the little insect-artist form, On higher life intent, its silken tomb. Let wondering rocks, in radiant birth, disclose The various tinctured children of the sun. From the prone beam let more delicious fruits, A flavour drink, that in one piercing taste Bids each combine. Let Gallic vineyards burst With floods of joy; with mild balsamic juice The Tuscan olive. Let Arabia breathe Her spicy gales, her vital gums distil. Turbid with gold, let southern rivers flow; And orient floods draw soft, o'er pearls, their maze. Let Afric vaunt her treasures; let Peru Deep in her bowels her own ruin breed, The yellow traitor that her bliss betray'd,â Unequal'd blissâand to unequal'd rage! Yet nor the gorgeous East, nor golden South, Nor, in full prime, that new discover'd world, Where flames the falling day, in wealth and praise, Shall with Britannia vie; while, Goddess, she Derives her praise from thee, her matchless charms. Her hearty fruits the hand of freedom own; And warm with culture, her thick clustering fields Prolific teem. Eternal verdure crowns Her meads; her gardens smile eternal spring. She gives the hunter-horse, unquel'd by toil, Ardent, to rush into the rapid chase: She, whitening o'er her downs, diffusive, pours Unnumber'd flocks: she weaves the fleecy robe, That wraps the nations: she, to lusty droves, The richest pasture spreads; and, hers, deep-wave Autumnal seas of pleasing plenty round. These her delights: and by no baneful herb, No darting tiger, no grim lion's glare, No fierce-descending wolf, no serpent roll'd In spires immense progressive o'er the land, Disturb'd. Enlivening these, add cities, full Of wealth, of trade, of cheerful toiling crowds: Add thriving towns; add villages and farms, Innumerous sow'd along the lively vale, Where bold unrival'd peasants happy dwell: Add ancient seats, with venerable oaks Embosom'd high, while kindred floods below Wind through the mead; and those of modern hand, More pompous, add, that splendid shine afar. Need I her limpid lakes, her rivers name, Where swarm the finny race? Thee, chief, O Thames! On whose each tide, glad with returning sails, Flows in the mingled harvest of mankind? And thee, thou Severn, whose prodigious swell, And waves, resounding, imitate the main? Why need I name her deep capacious ports, That point around the world? and why her seas? All ocean is her own, and every land To whom her ruling thunder ocean bears. She too the mineral feeds: the obedient lead, The warlike iron, nor the peaceful less, Forming of life art-civilized the bond; And that Tin. the Tyrian merchant sought of old, Not dreaming then of Britain's brighter fame. She rears to freedom an undaunted race: Compatriot zealous, hospitable, kind, Hers the warm Cambrian: hers the lofty Scot, To hardship tamed, active in arts and arms, Fired with a restless, an impatient flame, That leads him raptured where ambition calls: And English merit hers; where meet, combined, Whate'er high fancy, sound judicious thought, An ample generous heart, undrooping soul, And firm tenacious valour can bestow. Great nurse of fruits, of flocks, of commerce, she! Great nurse of men! by thee, O Goddess, taught, Her old renown I trace, disclose her source Of wealth, of grandeur, and to Britons sing A strain the Muses never touch'd before. âBut how shall this thy mighty kingdom stand? On what unyielding base? how finish'd shine?â At this her eye, collecting all its fire, Beam'd more than human; and her awful voice, Majestic thus she raised: âTo Britons bear This closing strain, and with intenser note Loud let it sound in their awaken'd ear: âOn virtue can alone my kingdom stand, On public virtue, every virtue join'd. For, lost this social cement of mankind, The greatest empires, by scarce-felt degrees, Will moulder soft away; till, tottering loose, They, prone at last, to total ruin rush. Unbless'd by virtue, government a league Becomes, a circling junto of the great, To rob by law; religion mild, a yoke To tame the stooping soul, a trick of state To mask their rapine, and to share the prey. What are, without it, senates; save a face Of consultation deep and reason free, While the determined voice and heart are sold? What boasted freedom, save a sounding name? And what election, but a market vile Of slaves self-barter'd? Virtue! without thee, There is no ruling eye, no nerve, in states; War has no vigour, and no safety peace: E'en justice warps to party, laws oppress, Wide through the land their weak protection fails, First broke the balance, and then scorn'd the sword. Thus nations sink, society dissolves; Rapine and guile and violence break loose, Everting life, and turning love to gall; Man hates the face of man, and Indian woods And Libya's hissing sands to him are tame. âBy those three virtues be the frame sustain'd Of British freedom; independent life; Integrity in office; and, o'er all Supreme, a passion for the commonweal. âHail! Independence, hail! Heaven's next best gift, To that of life and an immortal soul! The life of life! that to the banquet high And sober meal gives taste; to the bow'd roof Fair-dream'd repose, and to the cottage charms. Of public freedom, hail, thou secret source! Whose streams, from every quarter confluent, form My better Nile, that nurses human life. By rills from thee deduced, irriguous, fed, The private field looks gay, with nature's wealth Abundant flows, and blooms with each delight That nature craves. Its happy master there, The only freeman, walks his pleasing round: Sweet-featured peace attending; fearless truth; Firm resolution; goodness, blessing all That can rejoice; contentment, surest friend; And, still fresh stores from nature's book derived, Philosophy, companion ever new. These cheer his rural, and sustain or fire, When into action call'd, his busy hours. Meantime true judging moderate desires, Economy and taste, combined, direct His clear affairs, and from debauching fiends Secure his little kingdom. Nor can those Whom fortune heaps, without these virtues reach That truce with pain, that animated ease, That self-enjoyment springing from within; That independence, active or retired, Which make the soundest bliss of man below: But, lost beneath the rubbish of their means, And drain'd by wants to nature all unknown, A wandering, tasteless, gaily wretched train, Though rich, are beggars, and though noble, slaves. âLo! damn'd to wealth, at what a gross expense They purchase disappointment, pain, and shame. Instead of hearty hospitable cheer, See! how the hall with brutal riot flows; While in the foaming flood, fermenting, steep'd, The country maddens into party rage. Mark! those digraceful piles of wood and stone; Those parks and gardens, where, his haunts betrimm'd, And nature by presumptuous art oppress'd, The woodland genius mourns. See! the full board That steams disgust, and bowls that give no joy; No truth invited there, to feed the mind; Nor wit, the wine-rejoicing reason quaffs. Hark! how the dome with insolence resounds, With those retain'd by vanity to scare Repose and friends. To tyrant fashion, mark! The costly worship paid, to the broad gaze Of fools. From still delusive day to day, Led an eternal round of lying hope, See! self-abandon'd, how they roam adrift, Dash'd o'er the town, a miserable wreck! Then to adore some warbling eunuch turn'd, With Midas' ears they crowd; or to the buzz Of masquerade unblushing: or, to show Their scorn of nature, at the tragic scene They mirthful sit, or prove the comic true. But, chief, behold! around the rattling board, The civil robbers ranged; and e'en the fair, The tender fair, each sweetness laid aside, As fierce for plunder as all-licensed troops In some sack'd city. Thus dissolved their wealth, Without one generous luxury dissolved, Or quarter'd on it many a needless want, At the throng'd levee bends the venal tribe; With fair but faithless smiles each varnish'd o'er, Each smooth as those that mutually deceive, And for their falsehood each despising each; Till shook their patron by the wintry winds, Wide flies the wither'd shower, and leaves him bare. O far superior Afric's sable sons, By merchant pilfer'd, to these willing slaves! And rich, as unsqueezed favourite, to them, Is he who can his virtue boast alone! âBritons! be firm!ânor let corruption sly Twine round your heart indissoluble chains! The steel of Brutus burst the grosser bonds By CÃ¦sar cast o'er Rome; but still remain'd The soft enchanting fetters of the mind, And other CÃ¦sars rose. Determined, hold Your independence; for, that once destroy'd, Unfounded, Freedom is a morning dream, That flits aerial from the spreading eye. âForbid it, Heaven! that ever I need urge Integrity in office on my sons! Inculcate common honourânot to robâ And whom?âthe gracious, the confiding hand, That lavishly rewards? the toiling poor, Whose cup with many a bitter drop is mix'd; The guardian public; every face they see, And every friend; nay, in effect themselves. As in familiar life, the villain's fate Admits no cure; so, when a desperate age At this arrives, I the devoted race Indignant spurn, and hopeless soar away. âBut, ah too little known to modern times! Be not the noblest passion past unsung; That ray peculiar, from unbounded love Effused, which kindles the heroic soul; Devotion to the public. Glorious flame! Celestial ardour! in what unknown worlds, Profusely scatter'd through the blue immense, Hast thou been blessing myriads, since in Rome, Old virtuous Rome, so many deathless names From thee their lustre drew? since, taught by thee, Their poverty put splendour to the blush, Pain grew luxurious, and e'en death delight? O wilt thou ne'er, in thy long period, look, With blaze direct, on this my last retreat? â'Tis not enough, from self right understood Reflected, that thy rays inflame the heart: Though virtue not disdains appeals to self, Dreads not the trial; all her joys are true, Nor is there any real joy save hers. Far less the tepid the declaiming race, Foes to corruption, to its wages friends, Or those whom private passions, for a while, Beneath my standard list; can they suffice To raise and fix the glory of my reign? âAn active flood of universal love Must swell the breast. First, in effusion wide, The restless spirit roves creation round, And seizes every being: stronger then It tends to life, whate'er the kindred search Of bliss allies: then, more collected still, It urges human kind; a passion grown, At last, the central parent public calls Its utmost effort forth, awakes each sense, The comely, grand, and tender. Without this, This awful pant, shook from sublimer powers Than those of self, this Heaven-infused delight, This moral gravitation, rushing prone To press the public good, my system soon, Traverse, to several selfish centres drawn, Will reel to ruin: while for ever shut Stand the bright portals of desponding fame. âFrom sordid self shoot up no shining deeds, None of those ancient lights, that gladden earth, Give grace to being, and arouse the brave To just ambition, virtue's quickening fire! Life tedious grows, an idly bustling round, Fill'd up with actions animal and mean, A dull gazette! The impatient reader scorns The poor historic page; till kindly comes Oblivion, and redeems a people's shame. Not so the times when, emulation-stung, Greece shone in genius, science, and in arts, And Rome in virtues dreadful to be told! To live was glory then! and charm'd mankind, Through the deep periods of devolving time, Those, raptured, copy; these, astonish'd, read. âTrue, a corrupted state, with every vice And every meanness foul, this passion damps. Who can, unshock'd, behold the cruel eye? The pale inveigling smile? the ruffian front? The wretch abandon'd to relentless self, Equally vile if miser or profuse? Powers not of God, assiduous to corrupt? The fell deputed tyrant, who devours The poor and weak, Lord Molesworth, in his account of Denmark, says, âIt is observed, that in limited monarchies and commonwealths, a neighbourhood to the seat of the government is advantageous to the subjects; whilst the distant provinces are less thriving, and more liable to oppression.â at distance from redress? Delirious faction bellowing loud my name? The false fair-seeming patriot's hollow boast? A race resolved on bondage, fierce for chains, My sacred rights a merchandize alone Esteeming, and to work their feeder's will By deeds, a horror to mankind, prepared, As were the dregs of Romulus of old? Who these indeed can undetesting see?â But who unpitying? to the generous eye Distress is virtue; and, though self-betray'd, A people struggling with their fate must rouse The hero's throb. Nor can a land, at once, Be lost to virtue quite. How glorious then! Fit luxury for gods! to save the good, Protect the feeble, dash bold vice aside, Depress the wicked, and restore the frail. Posterity, besides! the young are pure, And sons may tinge their father's cheek with shame. âShould then the times arrive (which Heaven avert!) That Britons bend unnerved, not by the force Of arms, more generous and more manly, quell'd, But by corruption's soul-dejecting arts, Arts impudent! and gross! by their own gold, In part bestow'd, to bribe them to give all. With party raging, or immersed in sloth, Should they Britannia's well fought laurels yield To slily conquering Gaul; e'en from her brow Let her own naval oak be basely torn, By such as tremble at the stiffening gale, And nerveless sink while others sing rejoiced, Or (darker prospect! scarce one gleam behind Disclosing) should the broad corruptive plague Breathe from the city to the farthest hut, That sits serene within the forest shade; The fever'd people fire, inflame their wants, And their luxurious thirst, so gathering rage, That, were a buyer found, they stand prepared To sell their birthright for a cooling draught. Should shameless pens for plain corruption plead; The hired assassins of the commonweal! Deem'd the declaiming rant of Greece and Rome, Should public virtue grow the public scoff, Till private, failing, staggers through the land: Till round the city loose mechanic want, Dire prowling nightly, makes the cheerful haunts Of men more hideous than Numidian wilds, Nor from its fury sleeps the vale in peace; And murders, horrors, perjuries abound: Nay, till to lowest deeds the highest stoop; The rich, like starving wretches, thirst for gold; And those, on whom the vernal showers of Heaven All-bounteous fall, and that prime lot bestow, A power to live to nature and themselves, In sick attendance wear their anxious days, With fortune, joyless, and with honours, mean. Meantime, perhaps, profusion flows around, The waste of war, without the works of peace; No mark of millions in the gulf absorpt Of uncreating vice, none but the rage Of roused corruption still demanding more. That very portion, which (by faithful skill Employ'd) might make the smiling public rear Her ornamented head, drill'd through the hands Of mercenary tools, serves but to nurse A locust band within, and in the bud Leaves starved each work of dignity and use. âI paint the worst. But should these times arrive, If any nobler passion yet remain, Let all my sons all parties fling aside, Despise their nonsense, and together join; Let worth and virtue scorning low despair, Exerted full, from every quarter shine, Commix'd in heighten'd blaze. Light flash'd to light, Moral, or intellectual, more intense By giving glows. As on pure winter's eve, Gradual, the stars effulge; fainter, at first, They, straggling, rise; but when the radiant host, In thick profusion pour'd, shine out immense, Each casting vivid influence on each, From pole to pole a glittering deluge plays, And worlds above rejoice, and men below. âBut why to Britons this superfluous strain?â Good nature, honest truth e'en somewhat blunt, Of crooked baseness an indignant scorn, A zeal unyielding in their country's cause, And ready bounty, wont to dwell with themâ Nor only wontâwide o'er the land diffused, In many a bless'd retirement still they dwell. âTo softer prospect turn we now the view, To laurel'd science, arts, and public works, That lend my finish'd fabric comely pride, Grandeur and grace. Of sullen genius he! Cursed by the Muses! by the Graces loathed! Who deems beneath the public's high regard These last enlivening touches of my reign. However puff'd with power, and gorged with wealth, A nation be; let trade enormous rise, Let East and South their mingled treasure pour, Till, swell'd impetuous, the corrupting flood Burst o'er the city and devour the land: Yet these neglected, these recording arts, Wealth rots, a nuisance; and, oblivious sunk, That nation must another Carthage lie. If not by them, on monumental brass, On sculptured marble, on the deathless page, Impress'd, renown had left no trace behind: In vain, to future times, the sage had thought, The legislator plann'd, the hero found A beauteous death, the patriot toil'd in vain. The awarders they of Fame's immortal wreath, They rouse ambition, they the mind exalt, Give great ideas, lovely forms infuse, Delight the general eye, and, dress'd by them, The moral Venus glows with double charms. âScience, my close associate, still attends Where'er I go. Sometimes, in simple guise, She walks the furrow with the consul-swain, Whispering unletter'd wisdom to the heart, Direct; or, sometimes, in the pompous robe Of fancy dress'd, she charms Athenian wits, And a whole sapient city round her burns. Then o'er her brow Minerva's terrors nod: With Xenophon, sometimes, in dire extremes, She breathes deliberate soul, and makes retreat The famous Retreat of the Ten Thousand was chiefly conducted by Xenophon. Unequal'd glory: with the Theban sage, Epaminondas, first and best of men! Sometimes she bids the deep-embattled host, Above the vulgar reach, resistless form'd, March to sure conquestânever gain'd before! Epaminondas, after having beat the Lacedemonians and their allies, in the battle of Leuctra, made an incursion, at the head of a powerful army, into Laconia. It was now six hundred years since the Dorians had possessed this country, and in all that time the face of an enemy had not been seen within their territories. âPlutarch in Agesilaus. Nor on the treacherous seas of giddy state Unskilful she: when the triumphant tide Of high-swoln empire wears one boundless smile, And the gale tempts to new pursuits of fame, Sometimes, with Scipio, she collects her sail, And seeks the blissful shore of rural ease, Where, but the Aonian maids, no sirens sing; Or should the deep-brew'd tempest muttering rise, While rocks and shoals perfidious lurk around, With Tully she her wide-reviving light To senates holds; a Catiline confounds, And saves awhile from CÃ¦sar sinking Rome. Such the kind power, whose piercing eye dissolves Each mental fetter, and sets reason free; For me inspiring an enlightened zeal, The more tenacious as the more convinced How happy freemen, and how wretched slaves. To Britons not unknown, to Britons full The Goddess spreads her stores, the secret soul That quickens trade, the breath unseen that wafts To them the treasures of a balanced world. But finer arts (save what the Muse has sung In daring flight, above all modern wing,) Neglected droop the head; and public works, Broke by corruption into private gain, Not ornament, disgrace; not serve, destroy. âShall Britons, by their own joint wisdom ruled Beneath one Royal Head, whose vital power Connects, enlivens, and exerts the whole; In finer arts, and public works, shall they To Gallia yield? yield to a land that bends Depress'd, and broke, beneath the will of one? Of one who, should the unkingly thirst of gold, Or tyrant passions, or ambition, prompt, Calls locust-armies o'er the blasted land: Drains from its thirsty bounds the springs of wealth, His own insatiate reservoir to fill: To the lone desert patriot-merit frowns, Or into dungeons arts, when they, their chains, Indignant, bursting; for their nobler works All other license scorn but truths and mine. Oh shame to think! shall Britons, in the field Unconquer'd still, the better laurel lose? E'en in that monarch's reign, Lewis XIV. who vainly dreamt, By giddy power, betray'd, and flatter'd pride, To grasp unbounded sway; while, swarming round, His armies dared all Europe to the field; To hostile hands while treasure flow'd profuse, And, that great source of treasure, subjects' blood, Inhuman squander'd, sicken'd every land; From Britain, chief, while my superior sons, In vengeance rushing, dash'd his idle hopes, And bade his agonizing heart be low: E'en then, as in the golden calm of peace, What public works, at home, what arts arose! What various science shone! what genius glow'd! â'Tis not for me to paint, diffusive shot O'er fair extents of land, the shining road; The flood-compelling arch; the long canal, The Canal of Languedoc. Through mountains piercing and uniting seas; The dome The hospitals for foundlings and invalids. resounding sweet with infant joy, From famine saved, or cruel-handed shame; And that The hospitals for foundlings and invalids. where valour counts his noble scars, The land where social pleasure loves to dwell, Of the fierce demon, Gothic duel, freed; The robber from his farthest forest chased; The turbid city clear'd, and, by degrees, Into sure peace the best police refined, Magnificence, and grace, and decent joy. Let Gallic bards record, how honour'd arts, And science, by despotic bounty bless'd, At distance flourish'd from my parent-eye. Restoring ancient taste, how Boileau rose: How the big Roman soul shook, in Corneille, The trembling stage. In elegant Racine; How the more powerful though more humble voice Of nature-painting Greece, resistless, breathed The whole awaken'd heart. How Moliere's scene, Chastised and regular, with well judged wit, Not scatter'd wild, and native humour, graced, Was life itself. To public honours raised, How learning in warm seminaries The Academies of Sciences, of the Belles Lettres, and of Painting. spread; And, more for glory than the small reward, How emulation strove. How their pure tongue Almost obtain'd what was denied their arms. From Rome, awhile, how Painting, courted long, With Poussin came; ancient design, that lifts A fairer front, and looks another soul. How the kind art, Engraving. that, of unvalued price, The famed and only picture, easy, gives, Refined her touch, and, through the shadow'd piece, All the live spirit of the painter pour'd. Coyest of arts, how Sculpture northward deign'd A look, and bade her Girardon arise. How lavish grandeur blazed; the barren waste, Astonish'd, saw the sudden palace swell, And fountains spout amid its arid shades. For leagues, bright vistas opening to the view, How forests in majestic gardens smiled. How menial arts, by their gay sisters taught, Wove the deep flower, the blooming foliage train'd In joyous figures o'er the silky lawn, The palace cheer'd, illumed the storied wall, And with the pencil vied the glowing loom. The tapestry of the Gobelins. âThese laurels, Lewis, by the droppings raised Of thy profusion, its dishonour shade, And, green through future times, shall bind thy brow; While the vain honours of perfidious war Wither abhorr'd, or in oblivion lost. With what prevailing vigour had they shot, And stole a deeper root, by the full tide Of war-sunk millions fed? Superior still, How had they branch'd luxuriant to the skies, In Britain planted, by the potent juice Of Freedom swell'd? Forced is the bloom of arts, A false uncertain spring, when Bounty gives, Weak without me, a transitory gleam. Fair shine the slippery days, enticing skies Of favour smile, and courtly breezes blow; Till arts, betray'd, trust to the flattering air Their tender blossom: then malignant rise The blights of Envy, of those insect clouds, That, blasting merit, often cover courts: Nay, should, perchance, some kind MÃ¦cenas aid The doubtful beamings of his prince's soul, His wavering ardour fix, and unconfined Diffuse his warm beneficence around; Yet death, at last, and wintry tyrants come, Each sprig of genius killing at the root. But when with me imperial Bounty joins, Wide o'er the public blows eternal spring; While mingled autumn every harvest pours Of every land; whate'er Invention, Art, Creating Toil, and Nature can produce.â Here ceased the Goddess; and her ardent wings, Dipt in the colours of the heavenly bow, Stood waving radiance round, for sudden flight Prepared, when thus, impatient, burst my prayer: âOh forming light of life! O better sun! Sun of mankind! by whom the cloudy north, Sublimed, not envies Languedocian skies, That, unstain'd ether all, diffusive smile: When shall we call these ancient laurels ours? And when thy work complete?â Straight with her hand, Celestial red, she touch'd my darken'd eyes. As at the touch of day the shades dissolve, So quick, methought, the misty circle clear'd, That dims the dawn of being here below: The future shone disclosed, and, in long view, Bright rising eras instant rush'd to light. âThey come! great Goddess! I the times behold! The times our fathers, in the bloody field, Have earn'd so dear, and, not with less renown, In the warm struggles of the senate fight. The times I see! whose glory to supply, For toiling ages, Commerce round the world Has wing'd unnumber'd sails, and from each land Materials heap'd, that, well employ'd, with Rome Might vie our grandeur, and with Greece our art. âLo! Princes I behold! contriving still, And still conducting firm some brave design; Kings! that the narrow joyless circle scorn, Burst the blockade of false designing men, Of treacherous smiles, of adulation fell, And of the blinding clouds around them thrown: Their court rejoicing millions; Worth, alone, And Virtue dear to them; their best delight, In just proportion, to give general joy; Their jealous care thy kingdom to maintain; The public glory theirs; unsparing love Their endless treasure; and their deeds their praise. With thee they work. Nought can resist your force: Life feels it quickening in her dark retreats: Strong spread the blooms of Genius, Science, Art; His bashful bounds disclosing Merit breaks; And, big with fruits of glory, Virtue blows Expansive o'er the land. Another race Of generous youth, of patriot sires, I see! Not those vain insects fluttering in the blaze Of court, and ball, and play; those venal souls, Corruption's veteran unrelenting bands, That, to their vices slaves, can ne'er be free. âI see the fountains purged! whence life derives A clear or turbid flow; see the young mind Not fed impure by chance, by flattery fool'd, Or by scholastic jargon bloated proud, But fill'd and nourish'd by the light of truth. Then, beam'd through fancy the refining ray, And pouring on the heart, the passions feel At once informing light and moving flame; Till moral, public, graceful action crowns The whole. Behold! the fair contention glows, In all that mind or body can adorn, And form to life. Instead of barren heads, Barbarian pedants, wrangling sons of pride, And truth-perplexing metaphysic wits, Men, patriots, chiefs, and citizens are form'd. âLo! Justice, like the liberal light of Heaven, Unpurchased shines on all; and from her beam, Appalling guilt, retire the savage crew, That prowl amid the darkness they themselves Have thrown around the laws. Oppression grieves; See! how her legal furies bite the lip, While Yorkes and Talbots their deep snares detect, And seize swift justice through the clouds they raise. âSee! social Labour lifts his guarded head, And men not yield to government in vain. From the sure land is rooted ruffian force, And, the lew'd nurse of villains, idle waste; Lo! raised their haunts, down dash'd their maddening bowl, A nation's poison! beauteous order reigns! Manly submission, unimposing toil, Trade without guile, civility that marks From the foul herd of brutal slaves thy sons, And fearless peace. Or should affronting war To slow but dreadful vengeance rouse the just, Unfailing fields of freemen I behold! That know, with their own proper arm, to guard Their own bless'd isle against a leaguing world. Despairing Gaul her boiling youth restrains, Dissolved her dream of universal sway: The winds and seas are Britain's wide domain; And not a sail, but by permission, spreads. âLo! swarming southward on rejoicing suns, Gay colonies extend; the calm retreat Of undeserved distress, the better home Of those whom bigots chase from foreign lands. Nor built on rapine, servitude, and woe, And in their turn some petty tyrant's prey; But, bound by social Freedom, firm they rise; Such as, of late, an Oglethorpe has form'd, And crowding round, the charm'd Savannah sees. âHorrid with want and misery, no more Our streets the tender passenger afflict. Nor shivering age, nor sickness without friend, Or home, or bed to bear his burning load; Nor agonizing infant, that ne'er earn'd Its guiltless pangs; I see! the stores, profuse, Which British bounty has to these assign'd, No more the sacrilegious riot swell Of cannibal devourers! right applied, No starving wretch the land of freedom stains: If poor, employment finds; if old, demands, If sick, if maim'd, his miserable due; And will, if young, repay the fondest care. Sweet sets the sun of stormy life; and sweet The morning shines, in Mercy's dews array'd. Lo! how they rise! these families of Heaven! That! chief, The Founding Hospital. (but whyâye bigots!âwhy so late?) Where blooms and warbles glad a rising age; What smiles of praise! and, while their song ascends, The listening seraph lays his lute aside. âHark! the gay muses raise a nobler strain, With active nature, warm impassion'd truth, Engaging fable, lucid order, notes Of various string, and heart-felt image fill'd. Behold! I see the dread delightful school Of temper'd passions, and of polish'd life, Restored: behold! the well dissembled scene Calls from embellish'd eyes the lovely tear, Or lights up mirth in modest cheeks again. Lo! vanish'd monster land. Lo! driven away Those that Apollo's sacred walks profane: Their wild creation scatter'd, where a world Unknown to nature, Chaos more confused, O'er the brute scene its Ouran-Outangs pours; A creature which, of all brutes, most resembles man. See Dr. Tyson's Treatise on this animal. Detested forms! that, on the mind impress'd, Corrupt, confound, and barbarize an age. âBehold! all thine again the Sister-Arts, Thy graces they, knit in harmonious dance. Nursed by the treasure from a nation drain'd Their works to purchase, they to nobler rouse Their untamed genius, their unfetter'd thought; Of pompous tyrants, and of dreaming monks, The gaudy tools, and prisoners, no more. âLo! numerous domes a Burlington confess: For kings and senates fit, the palace see! The temple breathing a religious awe; E'en framed with elegance the plain retreat, The private dwelling. Certain in his aim, Taste, never idly working, saves expense. âSee! silvan scenes, where Art alone pretends To dress her mistress, and disclose her charms: Such as a Pope in miniature has shown; At his Twickenham Villa. A Bathurst o'er the widening forest Okely woods, near Cirencester. spreads; And such as form a Richmond, Chiswick, Stowe. âAugust, around, what public works I see! Lo! stately streets, lo! squares that court the breeze, In spite of those to whom pertains the care, Ingulfing more than founded Roman ways, Lo! ray'd from cities o'er the brighten'd land, Connecting sea to sea, the solid road. Lo! the proud arch (no vile exactor's stand) With easy sweep bestrides the chasing flood. See! long canals, and deepen'd rivers join Each part with each, and with the circling main The whole enliven'd isle. Lo! ports expand, Free as the winds and waves, their sheltering arms. Lo! streaming comfort o'er the troubled deep, On every pointed coast the lighthouse towers; And, by the broad imperious mole repell'd, Hark! how the baffled storm indignant roars.â As thick to view these varied wonders rose, Shook all my soul with transport, unassured, The Vision broke; and, on my waking eye, Rush'd the still ruins of dejected Rome. TO THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHT HON. LORD TALBOT, LATE CHANCELLOR OF GREAT BRITAIN. ADDRESSED TO HIS SON. While with the public, you, my Lord, lament A friend and father lost; permit the Muse, The Muse assign'd of old a double theme, To praise dead worth and humble living pride, Whose generous task begins where interest ends; Permit her on a Talbot's tomb to lay This cordial verse sincere, by truth inspired, Which means not to bestow but borrow fame. Yes, she may sing his matchless virtues nowâ Unhappy that she may.âBut where begin? How from the diamond single out each ray, Where all, though trembling with ten thousand hues, Effuse one dazzling undivided light? Let the low-minded of these narrow days No more presume to deem the lofty tale Of ancient times, in pity to their own, Romance. In Talbot we united saw The piercing eye, the quick enlighten'd soul, The graceful ease, the flowing tongue of Greece, Join'd to the virtues and the force of Rome. Eternal Wisdom, that all-quickening sun, Whence every life, in just proportion, draws Directing light and actuating flame, Ne'er with a larger portion of its beams Awaken'd mortal clay. Hence steady, calm, Diffusive, deep, and clear, his reason saw, With instantaneous view, the truth of things; Chief what to human life and human bliss Pertains, that noblest science, fit for man: And hence, responsive to his knowledge, glow'd His ardent virtue. Ignorance and vice, In consort foul, agree; each heightening each; While virtue draws from knowledge brighter fire. What grand, what comely, or what tender sense, What talent, or what virtue was not his; What that can render man or great, or good, Give useful worth, or amiable grace? Nor could he brook in studious shade to lie, In soft retirement, indolently pleased With selfish peace. The Syren of the wise, (Who steals the Aonian song, and, in the shape Of Virtue, woos them from a worthless world) Though deep he felt her charms, could never melt His strenuous spirit, recollected, calm, As silent night, yet active as the day. The more the bold, the bustling, and the bad, Press to usurp the reigns of power, the more Behoves it virtue, with indignant zeal, To check their combination. Shall low views Of sneaking interest or luxurious vice, The villain's passions, quicken more to toil, And dart a livelier vigour through the soul, Than those that mingled with our truest good, With present honour and immortal fame, Involve the good of all? An empty form Is the weak Virtue, that amid the shade Lamenting lies, with future schemes amused, While Wickedness and Folly, kindred powers, Confound the world. A Talbot's, different far, Sprung ardent into action: action, that disdain'd To lose in deathlike sloth one pulse of life, That might be saved; disdain'd for coward ease, And her insipid pleasures, to resign The prize of glory, the keen sweets of toil, And those high joys that teach the truly great To live for others, and for others die. Early, behold! he breaks benign on life. Not breathing more beneficence, the spring Leads in her swelling train the gentle airs: While gay, behind her, smiles the kindling waste Of ruffian storms and Winter's lawless rage. In him Astrea, to this dim abode Of ever wandering men, return'd again: To bless them his delight, to bring them back From thorny error, from unjoyous wrong, Into the paths of kind primeval faith, Of happiness and justice. All his parts, His virtues all, collected, sought the good Of humankind. For that he, fervent, felt The throb of patriots, when they model states: Anxious for that, nor needful sleep could hold His still-awaken'd soul; nor friends had charms To steal, with pleasing guile, one useful hour; Toil knew no languor, no attraction joy. Thus with unwearied steps, by Virtue led, He gain'd the summit of that sacred hill, Where, raised above black Envy's darkening clouds, Her spotless temple lifts its radiant front. Be named, victorious ravagers, no more! Vanish, ye human comets! shrink your blaze! Ye that your glory to your terrors owe, As, o'er the gazing desolated earth, You scatter famine, pestilence, and war; Vanish! before this vernal sun of fame; Effulgent sweetness! beaming life and joy. How the heart listen'd while he, pleading, spoke! While on the enlighten'd mind, with winning art, His gentle reason so persuasive stole, That the charm'd hearer thought it was his own. Ah! when, ye studious of the laws, again Shall such enchanting lessons bless your ear? When shall again the darkest truths, perplex'd, Be set in ample day? when shall the harsh And arduous open into smiling ease? The solid mix with elegant delight? His was the talent with the purest light At once to pour conviction on the soul, And warm with lawful flame the impassion'd heart. That dangerous gift with him was safely lodged By HeavenâHe, sacred to his country's cause, To trampled want and worth, to suffering right, To the lone widow's and her orphan's woes, Reserved the mighty charm. With equal brow, Despising then the smiles or frowns of power, He all that noblest eloquence effused, Which generous passion, taught by reason, breathes: Then spoke the man; and, over barren art, Prevail'd abundant nature. Freedom then His client was, humanity and truth. Placed on the seat of justice, there he reign'd, In a superior sphere of cloudless day, A pure intelligence. No tumult there, No dark emotion, no intemperate heat, No passion e'er disturb'd the clear serene That round him spread. A zeal for right alone, The love of justice, like the steady sun, Its equal ardour lent; and sometimes raised Against the sons of violence, of pride, And bold deceit, his indignation gleam'd, Yet still by sober dignity restrain'd. As intuition quick, he snatch'd the truth, Yet with progressive patience, step by step, Self-diffident, or to the slower kind, He through the maze of falsehood traced it on, Till, at the last, evolved, it full appear'd, And e'en the loser own'd the just decree. But when, in senates, he, to freedom firm, Enlighten'd Freedom, plann'd salubrious laws, His various learning, his wide knowledge, then, His insight deep into Britannia's weal, Spontaneous seem'd from simple sense to flow, And the plain patriot smooth'd the brow of law. No specious swell, no frothy pomp of words Fell on the cheated ear; no studied maze Of declamation, to perplex the right, He darkening threw around: safe in itself, In its own force, all-powerful Reason spoke; While on the great the ruling point, at once, He stream'd decisive day, and show'd it vain To lengthen further out the clear debate. Conviction breathes conviction; to the heart, Pour'd ardent forth in eloquence unbid, The heart attends: for let the venal try Their every hardening stupifying art, Truth must prevail, zeal will enkindle zeal, And Nature, skilful touch'd, is honest still. Behold him in the councils of his prince. What faithful light he lends! How rare, in courts, Such wisdom! such abilities! and join'd To virtue so determined, public zeal, And honour of such adamantine proof, As e'en corruption, hopeless, and o'erawed, Durst not have tempted! yet of manners mild, And winning every heart, he knew to please, Nobly to please; while equally he scorn'd Or adulation to receive, or give. Happy the state, where wakes a ruling eye Of such inspection keen, and general care! Beneath a guard so vigilant, so pure, Toil may resign his careless head to rest, And ever jealous freedom sleep in peace. Ah! lost untimely! lost in downward days! And many a patriot-counsel with him lost! Counsels, that might have humbled Britain's foe, Her native foe, from eldest time by fate Appointed, as did once a Talbot's arms. Let learning, arts, let universal worth, Lament a patron lost, a friend and judge, Unlike the sons of vanity, that veil'd Beneath the patron's prostituted name, Dare sacrifice a worthy man to pride, And flush confusion o'er an honest cheek. When he conferr'd a grace, it seem'd a debt Which he to merit, to the public, paid, And to the great all-bounteous Source of good! His sympathizing heart itself received The generous obligation he bestow'd. This, this indeed, is patronizing worth. Their kind protector him the Muses own, But scorn with noble pride the boasted aid Of tasteless vanity's insulting hand. The gracious stream, that cheers the letter'd world, Is not the noisy gift of summer's noon, Whose sudden current, from the naked root, Washes the little soil which yet remain'd, And only more dejects the blushing flowers: No, 'tis the soft-descending dews at eve, The silent treasures of the vernal year, Indulging deep their stores, the still night long; Till, with returning morn, the freshen'd world, Is fragrance all, all beauty, joy, and song. Still let me view him in the pleasing light Of private life, where pomp forgets to glare, And where the plain unguarded soul is seen. There, with that truest greatness he appear'd, Which thinks not of appearing; kindly veil'd In the soft graces of the friendly scene, Inspiring social confidence and ease. As free the converse of the wise and good, As joyous, disentangling every power, And breathing mix'd improvement with delight, As when amid the various-blossom'd spring, Or gentle beaming autumn's pensive shade, The philosophic mind with nature talks. Say ye, his sons, his dear remains, with whom The father laid surperfluous state aside, Yet raised your filial duty thence the more, With friendship raised it, with esteem, with love, Beyond the ties of love, oh! speak the joy, The pure serene, the cheerful wisdom mild, The virtuous spirit, which his vacant hours, In semblance of amusement, through the breast Infused. And thou, O Rundle! Dr. Rundle, Bishop of Derry in Ireland. See the Memoir. lend thy strain, Thou darling friend! thou brother of his soul! In whom the head and heart their stores unite: Whatever fancy paints, invention pours, Judgment digests, the well tuned bosom feels, Truth natural, moral, or divine, has taught, The virtues dictate, or the Muses sing. Lend me the plaint, which, to the lonely main, With memory conversing, you will pour, As on the pebbled shore you, pensive, stray, Where Derry's mountains a bleak crescent form, And mid their ample round receive the waves, That from the frozen pole, resounding, rush, Impetuous. Though from native sunshine driven, Driven from your friends, the sunshine of the soul, By slanderous zeal, and politics infirm, Jealous of worth; yet will you bless your lot, Yet will you triumph in your glorious fate, Whence Talbot's friendship glows to future times, Intrepid, warm; of kindred tempers born; Nursed, by experience, into slow esteem, Calm confidence unbounded, love not blind, And the sweet light from mingled minds disclosed, From mingled chymic oils as bursts the fire. I too remember well that cheerful bowl, Which round his table flow'd. The serious there Mix'd with the sportive, with the learn'd the plain; Mirth soften'd wisdom, candour temper'd mirth; And wit its honey lent, without the sting. Not simple nature's unaffected sons, The blameless Indians, round their forest-cheer, In sunny lawn or shady covert set, Hold more unspotted converse; nor, of old, Rome's awful consuls, her dictator swains, As on the product of their Sabine farms They fared, with stricter virtue fed the soul: Nor yet in Athens, at an Attic meal, Where Socrates presided, fairer truth, More elegant humanity, more grace, Wit more refined, or deeper science reign'd. But far beyond the little vulgar bounds Of family, or friends, or native land, By just degrees, and with proportion'd flame, Extended his benevolence: a friend To humankind, to parent nature's works. Of free access, and of engaging grace, Such as a brother to a brother owes, He kept an open judging ear for all, And spread an open countenance, where smiled The fair effulgence of an open heart; While on the rich, the poor, the high, the low, With equal ray, his ready goodness shone: For nothing human foreign was to him. Thus to a dread inheritance, my Lord, And hard to be supported, you succeed: But, kept by virtue, as by virtue gain'd, It will, through latest time, enrich your race, When grosser wealth shall moulder into dust, And with their authors in oblivion sunk Vain titles lie, the servile badges oft Of mean submission, not the meed of worth. True genuine honour its large patent holds Of all mankind, through every land and age, Of universal reason's various sons, And e'en of God himself, sole perfect Judge! Yet know these noblest honours of the mind On rigid terms descend: the high-placed heir, Scann'd by the public eye, that, with keen gaze, Malignant seeks out faults, cannot through life, Amid the nameless insects of a court, Unheeded steal: but, with his sire compared, He must be glorious, or he must be scorn'd. This truth to you, who merit well to bear A name to Britons dear, the officious Muse May safely sing, and sing without reserve. Vain were the plaint, and ignorant the tear That should a Talbot mourn. Ourselves, indeed, Our country robb'd of her delight and strength, We may lament. Yet let us, grateful, joy That we such virtues knew, such virtues felt, And feel them still, teaching our views to rise Through ever brightening scenes of future worlds. Be dumb, ye worst of zealots! ye that, prone To thoughtless dust, renounce that generous hope, Whence every joy below its spirit draws, And every pain its balm: a Talbot's light, A Talbot's virtues claim another source, Than the blind maze of undesigning blood; Nor when that vital fountain plays no more, Can they be quench'd amid the gelid stream. Methinks I see his mounting spirit, freed From tangling earth, regain the realms of day, Its native country: whence to bless mankind, Eternal goodness on this darksome spot Had ray'd it down a while. Behold! approved By the tremendous Judge of heaven and earth And to the Almighty Father's presence join'd, He takes his rank, in glory, and in bliss, Amid the human worthies. Glad around Crowd his compatriot shades, and point him out, With joyful pride, Britannia's blameless boast. Ah! who is he, that with a fonder eye Meets thine enraptured?â'Tis the best of sons! The best of friends!âToo soon is realized That hope, which once forbad thy tears to flow! Meanwhile the kindred souls of every land, (Howe'er divided in the fretful days Of prejudice and error) mingled now, In one selected never jarring state, Where God himself their only monarch reigns, Partake the joy; yet, such the sense that still Remains of earthly woes, for us below, And for our loss, they drop a pitying tear. But cease, presumptuous Muse, nor vainly strive To quit this cloudy sphere, that binds thee down: 'Tis not for mortal hand to trace these scenesâ Scenes, that our gross ideas groveling cast Behind, and strike our boldest language dumb. Forgive, immortal shade! if aught from earth, From dust low warbled, to those groves can rise, Where flows celestial harmony, forgive This fond superfluous verse. With deep-felt voice, On every heart impress'd, thy deeds themselves Attest thy praise. Thy praise the widow's sighs, And orphan's tears embalm. The good, the bad, The sons of justice and the sons of strife, All who or freedom or who interest prize, A deep-divided nation's parties all, Conspire to swell thy spotless praise to Heaven. Glad Heaven receives it, and seraphic lyres With songs of triumph thy arrival hail. How vain this tribute then! this lowly lay! Yet nought is vain that gratitude inspires. The Muse, besides, her duty thus approves To virtue, to her country, to mankind, To ruling nature, that, in glorious charge, As to her priestess, gives it her to hymn Whatever good and excellent she forms. TO THE MEMORY OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HON. SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. Shall the great soul of Newton quit this earth, To mingle with his stars; and every Muse, Astonish'd into silence, shun the weight Of honours due to his illustrious name? But what can man?âE'en now the sons of light, In strains high warbled to seraphic lyre, Hail his arrival on the coast of bliss. Yet am not I deterr'd, though high the theme, And sung to harps of angels, for with you, Ethereal flames! ambitious, I aspire In Nature's general symphony to join. And what new wonders can ye show your guest! Who, while on this dim spot, where mortals toil Clouded in dust, from Motion's simple laws, Could trace the secret hand of Providence, Wide-working through this universal frame. Have ye not listen'd while he bound the suns And Planets, to their spheres! the unequal task Of humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd O'er erring man the year, and oft disgraced The pride of schools, before their course was known Full in its causes and effects to him, All-piercing sage! Who sat not down and dream'd Romantic schemes, defended by the din Of specious words, and tyranny of names; But, bidding his amazing mind attend, And with heroic patience years on years Deep-searching, saw at last the system dawn, And shine, of all his race, on him alone. What were his raptures then! how pure! how strong! And what the triumphs of old Greece and Rome, By his diminish'd, but the pride of boys In some small fray victorious! when instead Of shatter'd parcels of this earth usurp'd By violence unmanly, and sore deeds Of cruelty and blood, Nature herself Stood all subdued by him, and open laid Her every latent glory to his view. All intellectual eye, our solar round First gazing through, he by the blended power Of Gravitation and Projection saw The whole in silent harmony revolve. From unassisted vision hid, the moons To cheer remoter planets numerous form'd, By him in all their mingled tracts were seen. He also fix'd our wandering Queen of Night, Whether she wanes into a scanty orb, Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadowy light, In a soft deluge overflows the sky. Her every motion clear-discerning, He Adjusted to the mutual Main, and taught Why now the mighty mass of water swells Resistless, heaving on the broken rocks, And the full river turning: till again The tide revertive, unattracted, leaves A yellow waste of idle sands behind. Then breaking hence, he took his ardent flight Through the blue infinite; and every star, Which the clear concave of a winter's night Pours on the eye, or astronomic tube, Far stretching, snatches from the dark abyss; Or such as further in successive skies To fancy shine alone, at his approach Blazed into suns, the living centre each Of an harmonious system: all combined, And ruled unerring by that single power, Which draws the stone projected to the ground. O unprofuse magnificence divine! O wisdom truly perfect! thus to call From a few causes such a scheme of things, Effects so various, beautiful, and great, A universe complete! And O, beloved Of Heaven! whose well purged penetrative eye The mystic veil transpiercing, inly scann'd The rising, moving, wide-establish'd frame. He, first of men, with awful wing pursued The Comet through the long eliptic curve, As round innumerous worlds he wound his way; Till, to the forehead of our evening sky Return'd, the blazing wonder glares anew, And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay. The heavens are all his own; from the wild rule Of whirling Vortices, and circling Spheres, To their first great simplicity restored. The schools astonish'd stood; but found it vain To combat still with demonstration strong, And, unawaken'd dream beneath the blaze Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled, With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd, When Newton rose, our philosophic sun! The aÃ«rial flow of Sound was known to him, From whence it first in wavy circles breaks, Till the touch'd organ takes the message in. Nor could the darting beam of speed immense Escape his swift pursuit, and measuring eye. E'en Light itself, which every thing displays, Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind Untwisted all the shining robe of day; And, from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze, Collecting every ray into his kind, To the charm'd eye educed the gorgeous train Of parent colours. First the flaming Red Sprung vivid forth; the tawny Orange next; And next delicious yellow; by whose side Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing Green. Then the pure Blue, that swells autumnal skies, Ethereal play'd; and then, of sadder hue, Emerged the deepen'd Indico, as when The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost. While the last gleamings of refracted light Dyed in the fainting violet away. These, when the clouds distil the rosy shower, Shine out distinct adown the watery bow; While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends Delightful, melting on the fields beneath. Myriads of mingling dyes from these result, And myriads still remain; infinite source Of beauty, ever blushing, ever new. Did ever poet image aught so fair, Dreaming in whispering groves, by the hoarse brook! Or prophet, to whose rapture heaven descends? E'en now the setting sun and shifting clouds, Seen, Greenwich, from thy lovely heights, declare How just, how beauteous the refractive law. The noiseless tide of Time, all bearing down To vast eternity's unbounded sea, Where the green islands of the happy shine, He stemm'd alone; and to the source (involved Deep in primeval gloom) ascending, raised His lights at equal distances, to guide Historian, wilder'd on his darksome way. But who can number up his labours? who His high discoveries sing? when but a few Of the deep-studying race can stretch their minds To what he knew: in fancy's lighter thought, How shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme? What wonder thence that his devotion swell'd Responsive to his knowledge? For could he, Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw The finish'd university of things, In all its order, magnitude, and parts, Forbear incessant to adore that power Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole? Say, ye who best can tell, ye happy few, Who saw him in the softest lights of life, All unwithheld, indulging to his friends The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind, Oh, speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calm, How greatly humble, how divinely good; How firm establish'd on eternal truth; Fervent in doing well, with every nerve Still pressing on, forgetful of the past, And panting for perfection: far above Those little cares, and visionary joys, That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart Of ever cheated, ever trusting man. And you, ye hopeless gloomy-minded tribe, You who, unconscious of those nobler flights That reach impatient at immortal life, Against the prime endearing privilege Of Being dare contend,âsay, can a soul Of such extensive, deep, tremendous powers, Enlarging still, be but a finer breath Of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile, And then for ever lost in vacant air? But hark! methinks I hear a warning voice, Solemn as when some awful change is come, Sound through the worldââ'Tis done!âThe measure's full; And I resign my charge.ââYe mouldering stones, That build the towering pyramid, the proud Triumphal arch, the monument effaced By ruthless ruin, and whate'er supports The worship'd name of hoar antiquity, Down to the dust! what grandeur can ye boast While Newton lifts his column to the skies, Beyond the waste of time. Let no weak drop Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child, These are the tombs that claim the tender tear, And elegiac song. But Newton calls For other notes of gratulation high, That now he wanders through those endless worlds He here so well descried, and wondering talks, And hymns their author with his glad compeers. O Britain's boast! whether with angels thou Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow-bless'd, Tho joy to see the honour of their kind; Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing, Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs, Comparing things with things, in rapture lost, And grateful adoration, for that light So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below, From light himself; Oh, look with pity down On humankind, a frail erroneous race! Exalt the spirit of a downward world! O'er thy dejected Country chief preside, And be her Genius call'd! her studies raise, Correct her manners, and inspire her youth. For, though depraved and sunk, she brought thee forth, And glories in thy name; she points thee out To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star: While in expectance of the second life, When time shall be no more, thy sacred dust Sleeps with her kings, and dignifies the scene. ON THE DEATH OF MR. AIKMAN. Mr. Aikman was born in Scotland, and was designed for the profession of the law; but went to Italy, and returned a painter. He was patronized in Scotland by the Duke of Argyle, and afterwards met with encouragement to settle in London; but falling into a long and languishing disease, he died at his house in Leicester Fields, June 1731, aged 50. Boyse wrote a panegyric upon him, and Mallet an epitaph. See Walpole's Anecdotes, vol. iv. p. 41. Oh, could I draw, my friend, thy genuine mind, Just as the living forms by thee design'd; Of Raphael's figures none should fairer shine, Nor Titian's colours longer last than mine. A mind in wisdom old, in lenience young, From fervent truth where every virtue sprung; Where all was real, modest, plain, sincere; Worth above show, and goodness unsevere: View'd round and round, as lucid diamonds throw Still as you turn them a revolving glow, So did his mind reflect with secret ray, In various virtues, Heaven's internal day; Whether in high discourse it soar'd sublime And sprung impatient o'er the bounds of Time, Or wandering nature through with raptured eye, Adored the hand that turn'd yon azure sky: Whether to social life he bent his thought, And the right poise of mingling passions sought, Gay converse bless'd; or in the thoughtful grove Bid the heart open every source of love: New varying lights still set before your eyes The just, the good, the social, or the wise. For such a death who can, who would refuse The friend a tear, a verse the mournful muse? Yet pay we just acknowledgment to heaven, Though snatch'd so soon, that Aikman e'er was given. A friend, when dead, is but removed from sight, Hid in the lustre of eternal light: Oft with the mind he wonted converse keeps In the lone walk, or when the body sleeps Lets in a wandering ray, and all elate Wings and attracts her to another state; And, when the parting storms of life are o'er, May yet rejoin him in a happier shore. As those we love decay, we die in part, String after string is sever'd from the heart; Till loosen'd life at lastâbut breathing clay, Without one pang, is glad to fall away. Unhappy he who latest feels the blow, Whose eyes have wept o'er every friend laid low, Dragg'd lingering on from partial death to death; And dying, all he can resign is breath. EPITAPH ON MISS STANLEY, See an allusion to this Lady in âSummer,â p. 81. IN HOLYROOD CHURCH, SOUTHAMPTON. E. S. Once a lively image of human nature, Such as God made it When he pronounced every work of his to be good. To the memory of Elizabeth Stanley, Daughter of George and Sarah Stanley; Who to all the beauty, modesty, And gentleness of nature, That ever adorned the most amiable woman, Joined all the fortitude, elevation, And vigour of mind, That ever exalted the most heroical man; Who having lived the pride and delight of her parents, The joy, the consolation, and pattern of her friends, A mistress not only of the English and French, But in a high degree of the Greek and Roman learning, Without vanity or pedantry, At the age of eighteen, After a tedious, painful, desperate illness, Which, with a Roman spirit, And a Christian resignation, She endured so calmly, that she seemed insensible To all pain and suffering, except that of her friends, Gave up her innocent soul to her Creator, And left to her mother, who erected this monument, The memory of her virtues for her greatest support; Virtues which, in her sex and station of life, Were all that could be practised, And more than will be believed, Except by those who know what this inscription relates. Here, Stanley, rest! escaped this mortal strife, Above the joys, beyond the woes of life, Fierce pangs no more thy lively beauties stain, And sternly try thee with a year of pain; No more sweet patience, feigning oft relief, Lights thy sick eye, to cheat a parent's grief: With tender art to save her anxious groan, No more thy bosom presses down its own: Now well earn'd peace is thine, and bliss sincere: Ours be the lenient, not unpleasing tear! O born to bloom, then sink beneath the storm; To show us virtue in her fairest form; To show us artless reason's moral reign, What boastful science arrogates in vain; The obedient passions knowing each their part; Calm light the head, and harmony the heart! Yes, we must follow soon, will glad obey; When a few suns have roll'd their cares away, Tired with vain life, will close the willing eye: 'Tis the great birthright of mankind to die. Bless'd be the bark! that wafts us to the shore, Where death-divided friends shall part no more: To join thee there, here with thy dust repose, Is all the hope thy hapless mother knows. ON THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER. See the Memoir. Ye fabled Muses, I your aid disclaim, Your airy raptures, and your fancied flame: True genuine woe my throbbing breast inspires, Love prompts my lays, and filial duty fires; My soul springs instant at the warm design, And the heart dictates every flowing line. See! where the kindest, best of mothers lies, And death has closed her ever watching eyes; Has lodged at last in peace her weary breast, And lull'd her many piercing cares to rest. No more the orphan train around her stands, While her full heart upbraids her needy hands! No more the widow's lonely fate she feels, The shock severe that modest want conceals, The oppressor's scourge, the scorn of wealthy pride, And poverty's unnumber'd ills beside. For see! attended by the angelic throng, Through yonder worlds of light she glides along, And claims the well earn'd raptures of the sky: Yet fond concern recalls the mother's eye; She seeks the helpless orphans left behind; So hardly left! so bitterly resign'd! Still, still! is she my soul's diurnal theme, The waking vision, and the wailing dream: Amid the ruddy sun's enlivening blaze O'er my dark eyes her dewy image plays, And in the dread dominion of the night Shines out again the sadly pleasing sight. Triumphant virtue all around her darts, And more than volumes every look impartsâ Looks, soft, yet awful; melting, yet serene; Where both the mother and the saint are seen. But ah! that nightâthat torturing night remains; May darkness dye it with the deepest stains, May joy on it forsake her rosy bowers, And streaming sorrow blast its baleful hours, When on the margin of the briny flood, Chill'd with a sad presaging damp I stood, Took the last look, ne'er to behold her more, And mix'd our murmurs with the wavy roar; Heard the last words fall from her pious tongue, Then, wild into the bulging vessel flung, Which soon, too soon, convey'd me from her sight, Dearer than life, and liberty, and light! Why was I then, ye powers, reserved for this? Nor sunk that moment in the vast abyss? Devour'd at once by the relentless wave, And whelm'd for ever in a watery grave?â Down, ye wild wishes of unruly woe!â I see her with immortal beauty glow; The early wrinkle, care-contracted, gone, Her tears all wiped, and all her sorrows flown; The exalting voice of Heaven I hear her breathe, To soothe her soul in agonies of death. I see her through the mansions blest above, And now she meets her dear expecting Love. Heart-cheering sight! but yet, alas! o'erspread By the dark gloom of Grief's uncheerful shade. Come then, of reason the reflecting hour, And let me trust the kind o'erruling Power, Who from the right commands the shining day, The poor man's portion, and the orphan's stay. THE HAPPY MAN. He's not the happy man, to whom is given A plenteous fortune by indulgent Heaven; Whose gilded roofs on shining columns rise, And painted walls enchant the gazer's eyes: Whose table flows with hospitable cheer, And all the various bounty of the year; Whose valleys smile, whose gardens breathe the spring, Whose carved mountains bleat, and forests sing? For whom the cooling shade in summer twines, While his full cellars give their generous wines; From whose wide fields unbounded autumn pours A golden tide into his swelling stores: Whose winter laughs; for whom the liberal gales Stretch the big sheet, and toiling commerce sails; When yielding crowds attend, and pleasure serves; While youth, and health, and vigour string his nerves. E'en not all these, in one rich lot combined, Can make the happy man, without the mind; Where judgment sits clear-sighted, and surveys The chain of reason with unerring gaze; Where fancy lives, and to the brightening eyes, His fairer scenes, and bolder figures rise; Where social love exerts her soft command, And lays the passions with a tender hand, Whence every virtue flows, in rival strife, And all the moral harmony of life. Nor canst thou, Dodington, this truth decline, Thine is the fortune, and the mind is thine. A PARAPHRASE ON THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTH CHAPTER OF ST. MATTHEW. When my breast labours with oppressive care, And o'er my cheek descends the falling tear; While all my warring passions are at strife, O, let me listen to the words of life! Raptures deep-felt His doctrine did impart, And thus He raised from earth the drooping heart. âThink not, when all, your scanty stores afford, Is spread at once upon the sparing board; Think not, when worn the homely robe appears, While, on the roof, the howling tempest bears; What further shall this feeble life sustain, And what shall clothe these shivering limbs again! Say, does not life its nourishment exceed? And the fair body its investing weed? âBehold! and look away your low despairâ See the light tenants of the barren air: To them, nor stores, nor granaries belong, Nought, but the woodland, and the pleasing song; Yet, your kind heavenly Father bends his eye On the least wing that flits along the sky, To him they sing, when Spring renews the plain, To him they cry, in Winter's pinching reign; Nor is their music, nor their plaint in vain; He hears the gay and the distressful call, And with unsparing bounty fills them all. âObserve the rising lily's snowy grace, Observe the various vegetable race; They neither toil, nor spin, but careless grow, Yet see how warm they blush! how bright they glow! What regal vestments can with them compare! What king so shining! or what queen so fair! If ceaseless thus the fowls of Heaven he feeds, If o'er the fields such lucid robes he spreads: Will he not care for you, ye faithless, say? Is he unwise? or are ye less than they? ON ÃOLUS'S HARP. Ethereal race, inhabitants of air, Who hymn your God amid the secret grove; Ye unseen beings, to my harp repair, And raise majestic strains, or melt in love. Those tender notes, how kindly they upbraid, With what soft woe they thrill the lover's heart! Sure from the hand of some unhappy maid, Who died for love, these sweet complainings part. But hark! that strain was of a graver tone, On the deep strings his hand some hermit throws; Or he, the sacred Bard, Jeremiah. who sat alone In the drear waste, and wept his people's woes. Such was the song which Zion's children sung, When by Euphrates' stream they made their plaint; And to such sadly solemn notes are strung Angelic harps, to soothe a dying saint. Methinks I hear the full celestial choir, Through Heaven's high dome their awful anthem raise; Now chanting clear, and now they all conspire To swell the lofty hymn from praise to praise. Let me, ye wandering spirits of the wind, Who, as wild fancy prompts you, touch the string, Smit with your theme, be in your chorus join'd, For till you cease, my Muse forgets to sing. HYMN ON SOLITUDE. Hail, mildly pleasing Solitude, Companion of the wise and good; But, from whose holy, piercing eye, The herd of fools, and villains fly. Oh! how I love with thee to walk, And listen to thy whisper'd talk, Which innocence and truth imparts, And melts the most obdurate hearts. A thousand shapes you wear with ease, And still in every shape you please. Now wrapt in some mysterious dream, A lone philosopher you seem; Now quick from hill to vale you fly, And now you sweep the vaulted sky; A shepherd next, you haunt the plain, And warble forth your oaten strain. A lover now, with all the grace Of that sweet passion in your face: Then, calm'd to friendship, you assume The gentle looking Hertford's bloom, As, with her Musidora, she (Her Musidora fond of thee) Amid the long-withdrawing vale, Awakes the rival'd nightingale. Thine is the balmy breath of morn, Just as the dew-bent rose is born; And while meridian fervors beat, Thine is the woodland dumb retreat; But chief, when evening scenes decay, And the faint landscape swims away, Thine is the doubtful soft decline, And that best hour of musing thine. Descending angels bless thy train, The virtues of the sage, and swain; Plain Innocence in white array'd Before thee lifts her fearless head; Religion's beams around thee shine, And cheer thy glooms with light divine: About thee sports sweet Liberty; And wrapt Urania sings to thee. Oh, let me pierce thy secret cell! And in thy deep recesses dwell; Perhaps from Norwood's oak-clad hill, When meditation has her fill, I just may cast my careless eyes, Where London's spiry turrets rise, Think of its crimes, its cares, its pain, Then shield me in the woods again. TO SERAPHINA. The wanton's charms, however bright, Are like the false illusive light, Whose flattering unauspicious blaze To precipices oft betrays: But that sweet ray your beauties dart, Which clears the mind, and cleans the heart, Is like the sacred queen of night, Who pours a lovely gentle light Wide o'er the dark, by wanderers blest, Conducting them to peace and rest. A vicious love depraves the mind, 'Tis anguish, guilt, and folly join'd; But Seraphina's eyes dispense A mild and gracious influence; Such as in visions angels shed Around the heaven-illumined head. To love thee, Seraphina, sure Is to be tender, happy, pure; 'Tis from low passions to escape, And woo bright virtue's fairest shape; 'Tis ecstasy with wisdom join'd; And heaven infused into the mind. VERSES ADDRESSED TO AMANDA. Amanda, as is stated in the Memoir, was a Miss Young, who married Vice Admiral Campbell. Ah, urged too late! from beauty's bondage free, Why did I trust my liberty with thee? And thou, why didst thou, with inhuman art, If not resolved to take, seduce my heart? Yes, yes, you said, for lovers' eyes speak true; You must have seen how fast my passion grew: And, when your glances chanced on me to shine, How my fond soul ecstatic sprung to thine! But mark me, fair oneâwhat I now declare Thy deep attention claims and serious care: It is no common passion fires my breast; I must be wretched, or I must be blest! My woes all other remedy deny; Or, pitying, give me hope, or bid me die! TO THE SAME, WITH A COPY OF THE âSEASONS.â Accept, loved Nymph, this tribute due To tender friendship, love, and you: In another MS. the first two lines read: Accept, dear Nymph! a tribute due To sacred friendship and to you; But with it take what breathed the whole, O take to thine the poet's soul. If Fancy here her power displays, And if a heart exalts these laysâ You, fairest, in that fancy shine, And all that heart is fondly thine. SONGS. A NUPTIAL SONG. Come, gentle Venus! and assuage A warring world, a bleeding age. For nature lives beneath thy ray, The wintry tempests haste away, A lucid calm invests the sea, Thy native deep is full of thee: The flowering earth where'er you fly, Is all o'er spring, all sun the sky. A genial spirit warms the breeze; Unseen among the blooming trees, The feather'd lovers tune their throat, The desert growls a soften'd note, Glad o'er the meads the cattle bound, And love and harmony go round. But chief into the human heart You strike the dear delicious dart; You teach us pleasing pangs to know, To languish in luxurious woe, To feel the generous passions rise, Grow good by gazing, mild by sighs; Each happy moment to improve, And fill the perfect year with love. Come, thou delight of heaven and earth! To whom all creatures owe their birth; Oh, come, sweet smiling! tender, come! And yet prevent our final doom. For long the furious god of war Has crush'd us with his iron car, Has raged along our ruin'd plains, Has foil'd them with his cruel stains, Has sunk our youth in endless sleep, And made the widow'd virgin weep. Now let him feel thy wonted charms, Oh, take him to thy twining arms! And, while thy bosom heaves on his, While deep he prints the humid kiss, Ah, then! his stormy heart control, And sigh thyself into his soul. TO AMANDA. This song was obligingly contributed to this edition by William Henry, present Lord Lyttelton, from a copy in Thomson's own hand, and is printed for the first time. [Come, dear Amanda, quit the town] Come, dear Amanda, quit the town, And to the rural hamlets fly; Behold! the wintry storms are gone; A gentle radiance glads the sky. The birds awake, the flowers appear, Earth spreads a verdant couch for thee; 'Tis joy and music all we hear, 'Tis love and beauty all we see. Come, let us mark the gradual spring, How peeps the bud, the blossom blows; Till Philomel begins to sing, And perfect May to swell the rose. E'en so thy rising charms improve, As life's warm season grows more bright; And opening to the sighs of love, Thy beauties glow with full delight. TO AMANDA. [Unless with my Amanda bless'd] Unless with my Amanda bless'd, In vain I twine the woodbine bower; Unless to deck her sweeter breast, In vain I rear the breathing flower. Awaken'd by the genial year, In vain the birds around me sing; In vain the freshening fields appear:â Without my love there is no Spring. TO FORTUNE. [For ever, Fortune, wilt thou prove] For ever, Fortune, wilt thou prove An unrelenting foe to love, And when we meet a mutual heart, Come in between, and bid us part: Bid us sigh on from day to day, And wish, and wish the soul away; Till youth and genial years are flown, And all the love of life is gone? But busy, busy still art thou, To bind the loveless joyless vow, The heart from pleasure to delude, And join the gentle to the rude. For pomp, and noise, and senseless show, To make us Nature's joys forego, Beneath a gay dominion groan, And put the golden fetter on! For once, O Fortune, hear my prayer, And I absolve thy future care; All other blessings I resign, Make but the dear Amanda mine. COME, GENTLE GOD. [Come, gentle God of soft desire] Come, gentle God of soft desire, Come and possess my happy breast, Not fury-like in flames and fire, Or frantic folly's wildness drest; A MS. copy of this song has the following variations: In rapture, rage, and nonsense drest. These are the vain disguise of love, And, or bespeak dissembled pains; Or else a fleeting fever prove, The frantic passion of the veins. But come in friendship's angel-guise; Yet dearer thou than friendship art, More tender spirit in thy eyes, More sweet emotions at thy heart. O, come with goodness in thy train, With peace and pleasure void of storm, And wouldst thou me for ever gain, Put on Amanda's winning form. TO HER I LOVE. Tell me, thou soul of her I love, Ah! tell me, whither art thou fled; To what delightful world above, Appointed for the happy dead? Or dost thou, free, at pleasure, roam, And sometimes share thy lover's woe; Where, void of thee, his cheerless home Can now, alas! no comfort know? Oh! if thou hover'st round my walk, While, under every well known tree, I to thy fancied shadow talk, And every tear is full of thee: Should then the weary eye of grief, Beside some sympathetic stream, In slumber find a short relief, Oh, visit thou my soothing dream! TO THE GOD OF FOND DESIRE. One day the God of fond desire, On mischief bent, to Damon said, âWhy not disclose your tender fire, Not own it to the lovely maid?â The shepherd mark'd his treacherous art, And, softly sighing, thus replied: âTis true, you have subdued my heart, But shall not triumph o'er my pride. âThe slave, in private only bears Your bondage, who his love conceals; But when his passion he declares, You drag him at your chariot-wheels.â THE LOVER'S FATE. Hard is the fate of him who loves, Yet dares not tell his trembling pain, But to the sympathetic groves, But to the lonely listening plain. Oh! when she blesses next your shade, Oh! when her footsteps next are seen In flowery tracts along the mead, In fresher mazes o'er the green: Ye gentle spirits of the vale, To whom the tears of love are dear, From dying lilies waft a gale, And sigh my sorrows in her ear. Oh! tell her what she cannot blame, Though fear my tongue must ever bind; Oh, tell her, that my virtuous flame Is, as her spotless soul, refined. Not her own guardian-angel eyes With chaster tenderness his care, Not purer her own wishes rise, Not holier her own sighs in prayer. But if, at first, her virgin fear Should start at love's suspected name, With that of friendship soothe her earâ True love and friendship are the same. TO THE NIGHTINGALE. O Nightingale, best poet of the grove, That plaintive strain can ne'er belong to thee, Bless'd in the full possession of thy love: O lend that strain, sweet Nightingale, to me! 'Tis mine, alas! to mourn my wretched fate: I love a maid who all my bosom charms, Yet lose my days without this lovely mate; Inhuman fortune keeps her from my arms. You, happy birds! by nature's simple laws Lead your soft lives, sustain'd by nature's fare; You dwell wherever roving fancy draws, And love and song is all your pleasing care: But we, vain slaves of interest and of pride, Dare not be bless'd, lest envious tongues should blame: And hence, in vain, I languish for my bride! O mourn with me, sweet bird, my hapless flame. TO MYRA. O thou, whose tender serious eyes Expressive speak the mind I love; The gentle azure of the skies, The pensive shadows of the grove: O mix their beauteous beams with mine, And let us interchange our hearts; Let all their sweetness on me shine, Pour'd through my soul be all their darts. Ah! 'tis too much! I cannot bear At once so soft, so keen a ray: In pity then, my lovely fair, O turn those killing eyes away! But what avails it to conceal One charm, where nought but charms I see? Their lustre then again reveal, And let me, Myra, die of thee! SONGS IN THE MASQUE OF âALFRED.â TO PEACE. O Peace! the fairest child of Heaven, To whom the sylvan reign was given, The vale, the fountain, and the grove, With every softer scene of love: Return, sweet Peace! and cheer the weeping swain! Return, with Ease and Pleasure in thy train. The Masque of Alfred was the joint composition of Thomson and Mallet; hence the authorship of the following songs is somewhat doubtful. TO ALFRED. FIRST SPIRIT. Hear, Alfred, father of the state, Thy genius Heaven's high will declare! What proves the hero truly great, Is never, never to despair: Is never to despair. SECOND SPIRIT. Thy hope awake, thy heart expand, With all its vigour, all its fires. Arise! and save a sinking land! Thy country calls, and Heaven inspires. BOTH SPIRITS. Earth calls, and Heaven inspires. âSWEET VALLEY, SAY.â Sweet valley, say, where, pensive lying, For me, our children, England, sighing, The best of mortals leans his head. Ye fountains, dimpled by my sorrow, Ye brooks that my complainings borrow, O lead me to his lonely bed: Or if my lover, Deep woods, you cover, Ah whisper where your shadows o'er him spread. 'Tis not the loss of pomp and pleasure, Of empire or of tinsel treasure, That drops this tear, that swells this groan: No; from a nobler cause proceeding, A heart with love and fondness bleeding, I breathe my sadly pleasing moan, With other anguish, I scorn to languish, For love will feel no sorrows but his own. âFROM THOSE ETERNAL REGIONS.â From those eternal regions bright, Where suns, that never set in night, Diffuse the golden day: Where Spring, unfading, pours around, O'er all the dew-impearled ground, Her thousand colours gay: O whether on the fountain's flowery side, Whence living waters glide, Or in the fragrant grove, Whose shade embosoms peace and love, New pleasures all our hours employ, And ravish every sense with every joy! Great heirs of empire! yet unborn, Who shall this island late adorn; A monarch's drooping thought to cheer, Appear! appear! appear! CONTENTMENT. If those, who live in shepherd's bower, Press not the rich and stately bed: The new-mown hay and breathing flower A softer couch beneath them spread. If those, who sit at shepherd's board, Soothe not their taste by wanton art; They take what Nature's gift afford, And take it with a cheerful heart. If those who drain the shepherd's bowl, No high and sparkling wines can boast, With wholesome cups they cheer the soul, And crown them with the village toast. If those who join in shepherd's sport, Gay dancing on the daisied ground, Have not the splendour of a court; Yet love adorns the merry round. RULE, BRITANNIA! WITH VARIATIONS. When Britain first, at Heaven's command, Arose from out the azure main, This was the charter of the land, And guardian angels sung this strain: âRule, Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never will be slaves.â The nations, not so bless'd as thee, Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall; While thou shalt flourish great and free, The dread and envy of them all. âRule,â &amp;c. Still more majestic shalt thou rise, More dreadful from each foreign stroke; As the loud blast that tears the skies Serves but to root thy native oak. âRule,â &amp;c. Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame: All their attempts to bend thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame, But work their woe, and thy renown. âRule,â &amp;c. To thee belongs the rural reign; Thy cities shall with commerce shine: All thine shall be the subject main: And every shore it circles thine. âRule,â &amp;c. The Muses, still with freedom found, Shall to thy happy coast repair: Bless'd isle! with matchless beauty crown'd, And manly hearts to guard the fair: âRule, Britannia, rule the waves, Britons never will be slaves.â TO THE REVEREND PATRICK MURDOCH, RECTOR OF STRADISHALL, IN SUFFOLK. 1738. Thus safely low, my friend, thou canst not fall: Here reigns a deep tranquillity o'er all; No noise, no care, no vanity, no strife; Men, woods, and fields, all breathe untroubled life. Then keep each passion down, however dear; Trust me, the tender are the most severe. Guard, while 'tis thine, thy philosophic ease, And ask no joy but that of virtuous peace; That bids defiance to the storms of fate: High bliss is only for a higher state! TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES. While secret-leaguing nations frown around, Ready to pour the long-expected storm; While she, who wont the restless Gaul to bound, Britannia, drooping, grows an empty form; While on our vitals selfish parties prey, And deep corruption eats our soul away: Yet in the Goddess of the Main appears A gleam of joy, gay-flushing every grace, As she the cordial voice of millions hears, Rejoicing, zealous, o'er thy rising race: Straight her rekindling eyes resume their fire, The Virtues smile, the Muses tune the lyre. But more enchanting than the Muse's song, United Britons thy dear offspring hail: The city triumphs through her glowing throng, The shepherd tells his transport to the dale; The sons of roughest toil forget their pain, And the glad sailor cheers the midnight main. Can aught from fair Augusta's gentle blood, And thine, thou friend of liberty! be born: Can aught save what is lovely, generous, good; What will, at once, defend us, and adorn? From thence prophetic joy new Edwards eyes, New Henries, Annas, and Elizas rise. May fate my fond devoted days extend, To sing the promised glories of thy reign! What though, by years depress'd, my Muse might bend; My heart will teach her still a nobler strain: How, with recover'd Britain, will she soar, When France insults, and Spain shall rob no more. TO DR. DE LA COUR, IN IRELAND. ON HIS âPROSPECT OF POETRY.â Hail gently warbling De la Cour, whose fame, Spurning Hibernia's solitary coast, Where small rewards attend the tuneful throng, Pervades Britannia's well discerning isle: In spite of all the gloomy-minded tribe That would eclipse thy fame, still shall the muse, High soaring o'er the tall Parnassian mount With spreading pinionsâsing thy wondrous praise, In strains attuned to the seraphic lyre. Sing unappall'd, though mighty be the theme! O! could she in thy own harmonious strain, Where softest numbers smoothly flowing glide In trickling cadence; where the milky maze Devolves in silence; by the harsher sound Of hoarser periods still unruffled, could Her lines but like thine own Euphrates flowâ Then might she sing in numbers worthy thee. But what can language do, when fancy finds Herself unequal to the lovely task? Can feeble words thy vivid colours paint, Or show the sweets which inexhaustive flow? Hearken, ye woods, and long-resounding groves; Listen, ye streams, soft purling through the meads; And hymning horrid, all ye tempests, roar. Awake, ye woodlands! sing, ye warbling, larks, In wildly luscious notes! But most of all, Attend, ye grateful fair, attend the youth Who sweetly sings of nature and of you: From you alone his conscious breast expects Its soft rewards, by sordid love of gain Unbias'd, undebased; to meaner minds Belong such narrow views; his nobler soul, Transported with a generous thirst of fame, Sublimely rises with expanded wings, And through the lucid empyrean soars. So the young eagle wings its rapid way Through heaven's broad azure; sometimes springs aloft, Now drops, now cleaves with even-waving wings The yielding air, nor seas nor mountains stop Its flight impetuous, gazing at the sun With irretorted eye, whilst he pervades A trackless void, and unexplored before. Long had the curious traveller strove to find The ruins of aspiring Babylonâ In vainâfor nought the nicest eye could trace Save one wide, watery, undistinguish'd waste: But you with more than magic art have raised Semiramis's city from its grave; You have reversed the scripture curse, which said, Dragons shall here inhabit; in your page We view the rising spires; the hurried eye Distracted wanders through the verdant maze; In middle air the pendant gardens hang, Tremendous ceiling!âwhilst no solar beam Falls on the lengthen'd gloom beneath; the woods Project above a steep-alluring shade; The finish'd garden opens to the view Wide stretching vistas, while the whispering wind Dimples along the breezy-ruffled lake. Now every tree irregular and bush Are prodigal of harmony: the birds Frequent the aerial wood, and nature blushes, Ashamed to find herself outdone by art: These and a thousand beauties could I sing, Collecting like the evertoiling bee From yonder mingled wilderness of flowers The aromatic sweets; while you, great youth! O'er thy decaying country chief preside; Be thou her genius call'd, inspire her youth With noble emulation to arrive At Helicon's fair font, which few, alas! Save you, have tasted of Hibernian youth. Thy country, though corrupted, brought thee forth, And deem'd her greatest ornament; and now Regards thee as her brightest northern star. Long may you reign as such; and should grim Time, With iron teeth, deprive us of our Pope, Then we'll transplant thy blooming laurels fresh From your bleak shore to Albion's happier coast. HYMN TO GOD'S POWER. Hail! Power Divine, who by thy sole command, From the dark empty space, Made the broad sea and solid land Smile with a heavenly grace. Made the high mountain and firm rock, Where bleating cattle stray; And the strong, stately, spreading oak, That intercepts the day. The rolling planets thou madest move, By thy effective will; And the revolving globes above Their destined course fulfill. His mighty power, ye thunders, praise, As through the heavens you roll; And his great name, ye lightnings, blaze, Unto the distant pole. Ye seas, in your eternal roar, His sacred praise proclaim; While the inactive sluggish shore Reechoes to the same. Ye howling winds, howl out his praise, And make the forests bow; While through the air, the earth, and seas, His solemn praise ye blow. O yon high harmonious spheres, Your powerful mover sing; To him your circling course that steers, Your tuneful praises bring. Ungrateful mortals, catch the sound, And in your numerous lays, To all the listening world around, The God of nature praise. A POETICAL EPISTLE TO SIR WILLIAM BENNET, BART. OF GRUBBAT. This was written at a very early period of Thomson's life, probably before he was sixteen; and the reason for inserting it is, that the first productions of genius are objects of rational curiosity. My trembling muse your honour does address, That it's a bold attempt most humbly I confess; If you'll encourage her young fagging flight, She'll upwards soar and mount Parnassus' height, If little things with great may be compared, In Rome it so with the divine Virgil fared; The tuneful bard Augustus did inspire, Made his great genius flash poetic fire; But if upon my flight your honour frowns, The muse folds up her wings, and dyingâjustice owns. ON MRS. MENDEZ' BIRTHDAY, WHO WAS BORN ON VALENTINE'S DAY. Thine is the gentle day of love, When youths and virgins try their fate; When, deep retiring to the grove, Each feather'd songster weds his mate. With temper'd beams the skies are bright, Earth decks in smiles her pleasing face; Such is the day that gave thee light, And speaks as such thy every grace. AN ELEGY UPON JAMES THERBURN, IN CHATTO. Now, Chatto, you're a dreary place, Pale sorrow broods on ilka face; Therburn has run his race, And now, and now, ah me, alas! The carl lies dead. Having his paternoster said, He took a dram and went to bed; He fell asleep, and death was glad That he had catch'd him; For Therburn was e'en ill bested, That none did watch him. For had the carl but been aware, That meagre death, who none does spare, T'attempt sic things should ever dare, As stop his pipe; He might have come to flee or skare; The greedy gipe. How he'd had but a gill or twae, Death wou'd nae got the victory sae, Nor put poor Therburn o'er the brae, Into the grave; The MS. is imperfect in this place. The fumbling fellow, some folks say, Should be jobb'd on baith night and day; She had without'en better play, Remained still, Barren for ever and for aye, Do what he will. Therefore they say he got some help In getting of the little whelp; But passing that, it makes me yelp, But what remead? Death lent him sic a cursed skelp, That now he's dead. Therburn, for evermore farewell, And be thy grave both dry and deep; And rest thy carcass soft and well, Free from no night Disturb ON THE REPORT THAT A WOODEN BRIDGE WAS TO BE BUILT AT WESTMINSTER. By Rufus' hall, where Thames polluted flows, Provoked, the Genius of the river rose, And thus exclaim'd: âHave I, ye British swains, Have I for ages laved your fertile plains? Given herds, and flocks, and villages increase, And fed a richer than a golden fleece? Have I, ye merchants, with each swelling tide, Pour'd Afric's treasure in, and India's pride? Lent you the fruit of every nation's toil? Made every climate yours, and every soil? Yet, pilfer'd from the poor, by gaming base, Yet must a wooden bridge my waves disgrace? Tell not to foreign streams the shameful tale, And be it publish'd in no Gallic vale.â He said; and plunging to his crystal dome, While o'er his head the circling waters foam. THE INCOMPARABLE SOPORIFIC DOCTOR. Dr. Patrick Murdoch. Sweet, sleeky Doctor! dear pacific soul! Lay at the beef, and suck the vital bowl! Still let the involving smoke around thee fly, And broad-look'd dullness settle in thine eye. Ah! soft in down these dainty limbs repose, And in the very lap of slumber doze; But chiefly on the lazy day of grace, Call forth the lambent glories of thy face; If aught the thoughts of dinner can prevail, And sure the Sunday's dinner cannot fail. To the thin church in sleepy pomp proceed, And lean on the lethargic book thy head. These eyes wipe often with the hallow'd lawn, Profoundly nod, immeasurably yawn. Slow let the prayers by thy meek lips be sung, Now let thy thoughts be distanced by thy tongue; If ere the lingerers are within a call, Or if on prayers thou deign'st to think at all. Yetâonly yetâthe swimming head we bend; But when serene, the pulpit you ascend, Through every joint a gentle horror creeps, And round you the consenting audience sleeps. So when an ass with sluggish front appears, The horses start, and prick their quivering ears; But soon as e'er the sage is heard to bray, The fields all thunder, and they bound away. LISY'S PARTING WITH HER CAT. The dreadful hour with leaden pace approach'd, Lash'd fiercely on by unrelenting fate, When Lisy and her bosom Cat must part: For now, to school and pensive needle doom'd, She's banish'd from her childhood's undash'd joy, And all the pleasing intercourse she kept With her grey comrade, which has often soothed Her tender moments, while the world around Glow'd with ambition, business, and vice, Or lay dissolved in sleep's delicious arms; And from their dewy orbs the conscious stars Shed on their friendship influence benign. But see where mournful Puss, advancing, stood With outstretch'd tail, casts looks of anxious woe On melting Lisy, in whose eye the tear Stood tremulous, and thus would fain have said, If nature had not tied her struggling tongue: âUnkind, O! who shall now with fattening milk, With flesh, with bread, and fish beloved, and meat, Regale my taste? and at the cheerful fire, Ah, who shall bask me in their downy lap? Who shall invite me to the bed, and throw The bedclothes o'er me in the winter night, When Eurus roars? Beneath whose soothing hand Soft shall I purr? But now, when Lisy's gone, What is the dull officious world to me? I loathe the thoughts of life:â thus plain'd the Cat, While Lisy felt, by sympathetic touch, These anxious thoughts that in her mind revolved, And casting on her a desponding look, She snatch'd her in her arms with eager grief, And mewing, thus began:ââO Cat beloved! Thou dear companion of my tender years! Joy of my youth! that oft hast lick'd my hands With velvet tongue ne'er stain'd by mouse's blood. Oh, gentle Cat! how shall I part with thee? How dead and heavy will the moments pass When you are not in my delighted eye, With Cubi playing, or your flying tail. How harshly will the softest muslin feel, And all the silk of schools, while I no more Have your sleek skin to soothe my soften'd sense? How shall I eat while you are not beside To share the bit? How shall I ever sleep While I no more your lulling murmurs hear? Yet we must partâso rigid fate decreesâ But never shall your loved idea, dear, Part from my soul, and when I first can mark The embroider'd figure on the snowy lawn, Your image shall my needle keen employ. Hark! now I'm call'd away! O direful sound! I comeâI come, but first I charge you allâ Youâyouâand you, particularly you, O, Mary, Mary, feed her with with the best, Repose her nightly in the warmest couch, And be a Lisy to her!ââHaving said, She sat her down, and with her head across, Rush'd to the evil which she could not shun, While a sad mew went knelling to her heart! ON THE HOOP. The hoop, the darling justly of the fair, Of every generous swain deserves the care. It is unmanly to desert the weak, 'Twould urge a stone, if possible, to speak; To hear stanch hypocrites bawl out, and cry, âThis hoop's a whorish garb, fie! ladies, fie!â O cruel and audacious men, to blast The fame of ladies more than vestals chaste; Should you go search the globe throughout, You'll find none so pious and devout; So modest, chaste, so handsome, and so fair, As our dear Caledonian ladies are. When awful beauty puts on all her charms, Nought gives our sex such terrible alarms, As when the hoop and tartan both combine To make a virgin like a goddess shine. Let quakers cut their clothes unto the quick, And with severities themselves afflict; But may the hoop adorn Edina's street, Till the south pole shall with the northern meet. STANZAS WRITTEN BY THOMSON ON THE BLANK LEAF OF A COPY OF HIS âSEASONSâ SENT BY HIM TO MR. LYTTELTON, SOON AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE. Go, little book, and find our Friend, Who nature and the Muses loves, Whose cares the public virtues blend With all the softness of the groves. A fitter time thou canst not choose, His fostering friendship to repay; Go then, and try, my rural muse, To steal his widow'd hours away. ON MAY. Among the changing months, May stands confest The sweetest, and in fairest colours drest! Soft as the breeze that fans the smiling field; Sweet as the breath that opening roses yield; Fair as the colour lavish Nature paints On Virgin flowers free from unodorous taints!â To rural scenes thou tempt'st the busy crowd, Who, in each grove, thy praises sing aloud! The blooming belles and shallow beaux, strange sight, Turn nymphs and swains, and in their sports delight. THE MORNING IN THE COUNTRY. When from the opening chambers of the east The morning springs, in thousand liveries drest, The early larks their morning tribute pay, And, in shrill notes, salute the blooming day. Refreshed fields with pearly dew do shine, And tender blades therewith their tops incline. Their painted leaves the unblown flowers expand, And with their odorous breath perfume the land. The crowing cock and chattering hen awakes Dull sleepy clowns, who know the morning breaks. The herd his plaid around his shoulders throws, Grasps his dear crook, calls on his dog, and goes Around the fold: he walks with careful pace, And fallen clods sets in their wonted place; Then opes the door, unfolds his fleecy care, And gladly sees them crop their morning fare! Down upon easy moss he lays, And sings some charming shepherdess's praise. ON A COUNTRY LIFE. This, and the two following poems, were written by Thomson, when at the University, and were published in the Edinburgh Miscellany, 12mo. 1720. I hate the clamours of the smoky towns, But much admire the bliss of rural clowns; Where some remains of innocence appear, Where no rude noise insults the listening ear; Nought but soft zephyrs whispering through the trees, Or the still humming of the painful bees; The gentle murmurs of a purling rill, Or the unwearied chirping of the drill; The charming harmony of warbling birds, Or hollow lowings of the grazing herds; The murmuring stockdoves melancholy coo, When they their loved mates lament or woo; The pleasing bleatings of the tender lambs, Or the indistinct mum'ling of their dams; The musical discord of chiding hounds, Whereto the echoing hill or rock resounds; The rural mournful songs of lovesick swains, Whereby they soothe their raging amorous pains; The whistling music of the lagging plough, Which does the strength of drooping beasts renew. And as the country rings with pleasant sounds, So with delightful prospects it abounds: Through every season of the sliding year, Unto the ravish'd sight new scenes appear. In the sweet spring the sun's prolific ray Does painted flowers to the mild air display; Then opening buds, then tender herbs are seen, And the bare fields are all array'd in green. In ripening summer, the full laden vales Gives prospect of employment for the flails; Each breath of wind the bearded groves makes bend, Which seems the fatal sickle to portend. In Autumn, that repays the labourer's pains, Reapers sweep down the honours of the plains. Anon black Winter, from the frozen north, Its treasuries of snow and hail pours forth; Then stormy winds blow through the hazy sky, In desolation nature seems to lie; The unstain'd snow from the full clouds descends, Whose sparkling lustre open eyes offends. In maiden white the glittering fields do shine; Then bleating flocks for want of food repine, With wither'd eyes they see all snow around, And with their fore feet paw and scrape the ground: They cheerfully do crop the insipid grass, The shepherds sighing, cry, Alas! alas! Then pinching want the wildest beast does tame; Then huntsmen on the snow do trace their game; Keen frost then turns the liquid lakes to glass, Arrests the dancing rivulets as they pass. How sweet and innocent are country sports, And, as men's tempers, various are their sorts. You, on the banks of soft meandering Tweed, May in your toils ensnare the watery breed, And nicely lead the artificial flee, Anglice, fly. Which, when the nimble, watchful trout does see, He at the bearded hook will briskly spring; Then in that instant twieth your hairy string, And, when he's hook'd, you, with a constant hand, May draw him struggling to the fatal land. Then at fit seasons you may clothe your hook, With a sweet bait, dress'd by a faithless cook; The greedy pike darts to't with eager haste, And being struck, in vain he flies at last; He rages, storms, and flounces through the stream, But all, alas! his life cannot redeem. At other times you may pursue the chase, And hunt the nimble hare from place to place. See, when the dog is just upon the grip, Out at a side she'll make a handsome skip, And ere he can divert his furious course, She, far before him, scours with all her force: She'll shift, and many times run the same ground; At last, outwearied by the stronger hound, She falls a sacrifice unto his hate, And with sad piteous screams laments her fate. See how the hawk doth take his towering flight, And in his course outflies our very sight, Bears down the fluttering fowl with all his might. See how the wary gunner casts about, Watching the fittest posture when to shoot: Quick as the fatal lightning blasts the oak, He gives the springing fowl a sudden stroke; He pours upon't a shower of mortal lead, And ere the noise is heard the fowl is dead. Sometimes he spreads his hidden subtile snare, Of which the entangled fowl was not aware; Through pathless wastes he doth pursue his sport, Where nought but moor-fowl and wild beasts resort. When the noon sun directly darts his beams Upon your giddy heads, with fiery gleams, Then you may bathe yourself in cooling streams; Or to the sweet adjoining grove retire, Where trees with interwoven boughs conspire To form a grateful shade;âthere rural swains Do tune their oaten reeds to rural strains; The silent birds sit listening on the sprays, And in soft charming notes do imitate their lays. There you may stretch yourself upon the grass, And, lull'd with music, to kind slumbers pass: No meagre cares your fancy will distract, And on that scene no tragic fears will act; Save the dear image of a charming she, Nought will the object of your vision be. Away the vicious pleasures of the town; Let empty partial fortune on me frown; But grant, ye powers, that it may be my lot To live in peace from noisy towns remote. ON HAPPINESS. Warm'd by the summer sun's meridian ray, As underneath a spreading oak I lay Contemplating the mighty load of woe, In search of bliss that mortals undergo, Who, while they think they happiness enjoy, Embrace a curse wrapt in delusive joy, I reason'd thus: Since the Creator, God, Who in eternal love makes his abode, Hath blended with the essence of the soul An appetite as fixed as the pole, That's always eager in pursuit of bliss, And always veering till it points to this, There is some object adequate to fill This boundless wish of our extended will. Now, while my thought round nature's circle runs (A bolder journey than the furious sun's) This chief and satiating good to find The attracting centre of the human mind, My ears they deafen'd, to my swimming eyes His magic wand the drowsy God applies, Bound all my senses in a silken sleep, While mimic fancy did her vigils keep; Yet still methinks some condescending power Ranged the ideas in my mind that hour. Methought I wandering was, with thousands more, Beneath a high prodigious hill, before, Above the clouds whose towering summit rose, With utmost labour only gained by those Who groveling prejudices throw away, And with incessant straining climb'd their way; Where all who stood their failing breath to gain, With headlong ruin tumbled down amain. This mountain is through every nation famed, And, as I learned, Contemplation named. O happy me! when I had reach'd its top Unto my sight a boundless scene did ope. First, sadly I survey'd with downward eye, Of restless men below the busy fry, Who hunted trifles in an endless maze, Like foolish boys, on sunny summer days, Pursuing butterflies with all their might, Who can't their troubles, in the chase requite. The painted insect, he who most admires, Grieves most when it in his rude hand expires; Or should it live, with endless fears is toss'd, Lest it take wing and be for ever lost. Some men I saw their utmost art employ How to attain a false deceitful joy, Which from afar conspicuously did blaze, And at a distance fix'd their ravish'd gaze, But nigh at hand it mock'd their fond embrace. When lo! again it flashed in their eyes, But still, as they drew near, the fond illusion dies. Just so I've seen a water-dog pursue An unflown duck within his greedy view, When he has, panting, at his prey arrived, The coxcomb foolingâsuddenly it dived; He, gripping, is almost with water choked, And grieves that all his towering hopes are mock'd. Then it emerges, he renews his toil, And o'er and o'er again he gets the foil. Yea, all the joys beneath the conscious sun, And softer ones that his inspection shun, Much of their pleasures in fruition fade. Enjoyment o'er them throws a sullen shade. The reason is, we promise vaster things And sweeter joys than from their nature springs: When they are lost, we weep the apparent bliss, And not what really in Fruition is; So that our griefs are greater than our joys, And real pain springs from fantastic toys. Though all terrene delights of men below Are almost nothing but a glaring show; Yet if there always were a virgin joy When t'other fades to soothe the wanton boy, He somewhat might excuse his heedless course, Some show of reason for the same enforce: But frugal nature wisely does deny To mankind such profuse variety; Has what is needful only to us given, To feed and cheer us in the way to Heaven; And more would but the traveller delay, Impede and clog him in his upward way. I from the mount all mortal pleasures saw Themselves within a narrow compass draw: The libertine a nauseous circle run, And dully acted what he'd often done. Just so when Luna darts her silver ray, And pours on silent earth a paler day: From Stygian caves the flitting fairies scud, And on the margent of some limpid flood, Which by reflected moonlight darts a glance, In midnight circles range themselves and dance. To-morrow, cries he, will us entertain: Pray what's to-morrow but to-day again? Deluded youth, no more the chase pursue, So oft deceived, no more the toil renew. But in a constant and a fix'd design Of acting well there is a lasting mine Of solid satisfaction, purest joy, For virtue's pleasures never, never cloy: Then hither come, climb up the steep ascent, Your painful labour you will ne'er repent, From Heaven itself here you're but one remove, Here's the prÃ¦ludium of the joys above, Here you'll behold the awful Godhead shine, And all perfections in the same combine; You'll see that God, who, by his powerful call, From empty nothing drew this spacious all, Made beauteous order the rude mass control, And every part subservient to the whole; Here you'll behold upon the fatal tree The God of nature bleed, expire, and die, For such as 'gainst his holy laws rebel, And such as bid defiance to his hell. Through the dark gulf, here you may clearly pry 'Twixt narrow Time and vast Eternity. Behold the Godhead just, as well as good, And vengeance pour'd on tramplers on his blood: But all the tears wiped from his people's eyes, And, for their entrance, cleave the parting skies. Then sure you will with holy ardours burn, And to seraphic heats your passion turn; Then in your eyes all mortal fair will fade, And leave of mortal beauties but the shade; Yourself to him you'll solemnly devote, To him, without whose providence you're not; You'll of his service relish the delight, And to his praises all your powers excite; You'll celebrate his name in heavenly sound, Which well pleased skies in echoes will rebound; This is the greatest happiness that can Possessed be in this short life by man. But darkly here the Godhead we survey, Confined and cramped in this cage of clay. What cruel band is this to earth that ties Our souls from soaring to their native skies? Upon the bright eternal face to gaze, And there drink in the beatific rays: There to behold the good one and the fair, A ray from whom all mortal beauties are? In beauteous nature all the harmony Is but the echo of the Deity, Of all perfection who the centre is, And boundless ocean of untainted bliss; For ever open to the ravish'd view, And full enjoyment of the radiant crew Who live in raptures of eternal joy, Whose flaming love their tuneful harps employ In solemn hymns Jehovah's praise to sing, And make all heaven with hallelujahs ring. These realms of light no further I'll explore, And in these heights I will no longer soar: Not like our grosser atmosphere beneath, The ether here's too thin for me to breathe. The region is unsufferable bright, And flashes on me with too strong a light. Then from the mountain, lo! I now descend, And to my vision put a hasty end. VERSES ON RECEIVING A FLOWER FROM HIS MISTRESS. Madam, the flower that I received from you, Ere I came home, had lost its lovely hue: As flowers deprived of the genial day, Its sprightly bloom did wither and decay; Dear, fading flower, I know full well, said I, The reason why you shed your sweets and die; You want the influence of her enlivening eye. Your case is mineâAbsence, that plague of love! With heavy pace makes every minute move: It of my being is an empty blank, And hinders me myself with men to rank; Your cheering presence quickeneth me again, And new-sprung life exults in every vein. PROLOGUE TO TANCRED AND SIGISMUNDA. Bold is the man! who, in this nicer age, Presumes to tread the chaste corrected stage. Now, with gay tinsel arts, we can no more Conceal the want of Nature's sterling ore. Our spells are vanish'd, broke our magic wand, That used to wast you over sea and land. Before your light the fairy people fade, The demons flyâthe ghost itself is laid. In vain of martial scenes the loud alarms, The mighty prompter thundering out to arms, The playhouse posse clattering from afar, The close-wedged battle, and the din of war. Now, e'en the senate seldom we convene: The yawning fathers nod behind the scene. Your taste rejects the glittering false sublime, To sigh in metaphor, and die in rhyme. High rant is tumbled from his gallery throne: Description dreamsânay, similies are gone. What shall we then? to please you how devise Whose judgment sits not in your ears and eyes? Thrice happy! could we catch great Shakespeare's art, To trace the deep recesses of the heart; His simple plain sublime, to which is given To strike the soul with darted flame from heaven: Could we awake soft Otway's tender woe, The pomp of verse and golden lines of Rowe. We to your hearts apply; let them attend; Before their silent candid bar we bend. If warm'd, they listen, 'tis our noblest praise; If cold, they wither all the Muse's bays. EPILOGUE TO TANCRED AND SIGISMUNDA. Cramm'd to the throat with wholesome moral stuff, Alas! poor audience! you have had enough. Was ever hapless heroine of a play In such a piteous plight as ours to-day? Was ever woman so by love betray'd? Match'd with two husbands, and yetâdie a maid. But bless me!âholdâWhat sounds are these I hear!â I see the Tragic Muse herself appear. The back scene opens, and discovers a romantic sylvan landscape; from which Mrs. Cibber, in the character of the Tragic Muse, advances slowly to music, and speaks the following lines: Hence with your flippant epilogue, that tries To wipe the virtuous tear from British eyes; That dares my moral, tragic scene profane, With strainsâat best, unsuiting, light and vain. Hence from the pure unsullied beams that play In yon fair eyes where virtue shinesâAway! Britons, to you from chaste Castalian groves, Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy loves! Where shades of heroes roam, each mighty name, And court my aid to rise again to fame; To you I come, to Freedom's noblest seat, And in Britannia fix my last retreat. In Greece and Rome, I watch'd the public weal, The purple tyrant trembled at my steel: Nor did I less o'er private sorrows reign, And mend the melting heart with softer pain. On France and you then rose my brightening star, With social rayâThe arts are ne'er at war. O, as your fire and genius stronger blaze, As yours are generous Freedom's bolder lays, Let not the Gallic taste leave yours behind, In decent manners and in life refined; Banish the motley mode to tag low verse, The laughing ballad to the mournful hearse. When through five acts your hearts have learnt to glow, Touch'd with the sacred force of honest woe; O keep the dear impression on your breast, Nor idly loose it for a wretched jest. EPILOGUE TO AGAMEMNON. Our bard, to modern epilogue a foe, Thinks such mean mirth but deadens generous woe; Dispels in idle air the moral sigh, And wipes the tender tear from Pity's eye: No more with social warmth the bosom burns; But all the unfeeling selfish man returns. Thomson observes, âAnother epilogue was spoken after the first representation of the play, which began with the first six lines of this; but the rest of that epilogue having been very justly disliked by the audience, this was substituted in its place.â Thus he began:âAnd you approved the strain; Till the next couplet sunk to light and vain. You check'd him there.âTo you, to reason just, He owns he triumph'd in your kind disgust. Charm'd by your frown, by your displeasure graced, He hails the rising virtue of your taste. Wide will its influence spread as soon as known: Truth, to be loved, needs only to be shown. Confirm it, once, the fashion to be good: (Since fashion leads the fool, and awes the rude) No petulance shall wound the public ear; No hand applaud what honour shuns to hear: No painful blush the modest cheek shall stain; The worthy breast shall heave with no disdain. Chastised to decency, the British stage Shall oft invite the fair, invite the sage: Both shall attend well pleased, well pleased depart; Or if they doom the verse, absolve the heart. PROLOGUE TO MALLET'S MUSTAPHA. Since Athens first began to draw mankind, To picture life, and show the impassion'd mind; The truly wise have ever deem'd the stage The moral school of each enlighten'd age. There, in full pomp, the tragic Muse appears, Queen of soft sorrows, and of useful fears. Faint is the lesson reason's rules impart: She pours it strong, and instant through the heart. If virtue is her theme, we sudden glow With generous flame; and what we feel, we grow. If vice she paints, indignant passions rise; The villain sees himself with loathing eyes. His soul starts, conscious, at another's groan, And the pale tyrant trembles on his throne. To-night, our meaning scene attempts to show What fell events from dark suspicion flow; Chief when it taints a lawless monarch's mind, To the false herd of flattering slaves confined. The soul sinks gradual to so dire a state; E'en excellence but serves to feed its hate: To hate remorseless cruelty succeeds, And every worth, and every virtue bleeds. Behold, our author at your bar appears, His modest hopes depress'd by conscious fears. Faults he has manyâbut to balance those, His verse with heart-felt love of virtue glows: All slighter errors let indulgence spare, And be his equal trial full and fair. For this best British privilege we call, Thenâas he merits, let him stand or fall. PSALM CIV. PARAPHRASED. This was one of Thomson's earliest pieces. See the Memoir, p. xi. and the Addenda. To praise thy Author, Soul, do not forget; Canst thou, in gratitude, deny the debt? Lord, thou art great, how great we cannot know; Honour and majesty do round thee flow. The purest rays of primogenial light Compose thy robes, and make them dazzling bright; The heavens and all the wide spread orbs on high Thou like a curtain stretch'd of curious dye; On the devouring flood thy chambers are Establish'd; a lofty cloud's thy car; Which quick through the ethereal road doth fly, On swift wing'd winds, that shake the troubled sky. Of spiritual substance angels thou didst frame, Active and bright, piercing and quick as flame. Thou'st firmly founded this unwieldy earth; Stand fast for aye, thou saidst, at nature's birth. The swelling flood thou o'er the earth madest creep, And coveredst it with the vast hoary deep: Then hills and vales did no distinction know, But level'd nature lay oppress'd below. With speed they, at thy awful thunder's roar, Shrinked within the limits of their shore. Through secret tracts they up the mountains creep, And rocky caverns fruitful moisture weep, Which sweetly through the verdant vales doth glide, Till 'tis devoured by the greedy tide. The feeble sands thou'st made the ocean's mounds, Its foaming waves shall ne'er repass these bounds, Again to triumph over the dry grounds. Between the hills, grazed by the bleating kind, Soft warbling rills their mazy way do find; By him appointed fully to supply, When the hot dogstar fires the realms on high, The raging thirst of every sickening beast, Of the wild ass that roams the dreary waste: The feather'd nations, by their smiling sides, In lowly brambles, or in trees abide; By nature taught, on them they rear their nests, That with inimitable art are dress'd. They for the shade and safety of the wood With natural music cheer the neighbourhood. He doth the clouds with genial moisture fill, Which on the [shr]ivel'd ground they bounteously distil, And nature's lap with various blessings crowd: The giver, God! all creatures cry aloud. With freshest green he clothes the fragrant mead, Whereon the grazing herds wanton and feed. With vital juice he makes the plants abound, And herbs securely spring above the ground, That man may be sustain'd beneath the toil Of manuring the ill producing soil; Which with a plenteous harvest does at last Cancel the memory of labours past; Yields him the product of the generous vine, And balmy oil that makes his face to shine: Fills all his granaries with a loaden crop, Against the bare barren winter his great prop. The trees of God with kindly sap do swell, E'en cedars tall in Lebanon that dwell, Upon whose lofty tops the birds erect Their nests, as careful nature does direct. The long neck'd storks unto the fir trees fly, And with their cackling cries disturb the sky. To unfrequented hills wild goats resort, And on bleak rocks the nimble conies sport. The changing moon he clad with silver light, To check the black dominion of the night: High through the skies in silent state she rides, And by her rounds the fleeting time divides. The circling sun doth in due time decline, And unto shades the murmuring world resign. Dark night thou makest succeed the cheerful day, Which forest beasts from their lone caves survey: They rouse themselves, creep out, and search their prey. Young hungry lions from their dens come out, And, mad on blood, stalk fearfully about: They break night's silence with their hideous roar, And from kind heaven their nightly prey implore. Just as the lark begins to stretch her wing, And, flickering on her nest, makes short essays to sing, And the sweet dawn, with a faint glimmering light, Unveils the face of nature to the sight, To their dark dens they take their hasty flight. Not so the husbandman,âfor with the sun He does his pleasant course of labours run: Home with content in the cool e'en returns, And his sweet toils until the morn adjourns. How many are thy wondrous works, O Lord! They of thy wisdom solid proofs afford: Out of thy boundless goodness thou didst fill, With riches and delights, both vale and hill: E'en the broad ocean, wherein do abide Monsters that flounce upon the boiling tide, And swarms of lesser beasts and fish beside: 'Tis there that daring ships before the wind Do send amain, and make the port assign'd: 'Tis there that Leviathan sports and plays, And spouts his water in the face of day; For food with gaping mouth they wait on thee, If thou withhold'st, they pine, they faint, they die. Thou bountifully opest thy liberal hand, And scatter'st plenty both on sea and land. Thy vital spirit makes all things live below, The face of nature with new beauties glow. God's awful glory ne'er will have an end, To vast eternity it will extend. When he surveys his works, at the wide sight He doth rejoice, and take divine delight. His looks the earth into its centre shakes; A touch of his to smoke the mountains makes. I'll to God's honour consecrate my lays, And when I cease to be I'll cease to praise. Upon the Lord, a sublime lofty theme, My meditations sweet, my joys supreme. Let daring sinners feel thy vengeful rod, May they no more be known by their abode. My soul and all my powers. O bless the Lord, And the whole race of men with one accord. LINES ON MARLE FIELD. What is the task that to the muse belongs? What but to deck in her harmonious songs The beauteous works of nature and of art, Rural retreats that cheer the heavy heart? Then Marle Field begin, my muse, and sing; With Marle Field the hills and vales shall ring. O! what delight and pleasure 'tis to rove Through all the walks and alleys of this grove, Where spreading trees a checker'd scene display, Partly admitting and excluding day; Where cheerful green and odorous sweets conspire The drooping soul with pleasure to inspire; Where little birds employ their narrow throats To sing its praises in unlabour'd notes. To it adjoin'd a rising fabric stands, Which with its state our silent awe commands. Its endless beauties mock the poet's pen; So to the garden I'll return again. Pomona makes the trees with fruit abound, And blushing Flora paints the enamel'd ground. Here lavish nature does her stores disclose, Flowers of all hue, their queen the bashful rose, With their sweet breath the ambient air's perfumed, Nor is thereby their fragrant stores consumed. O'er the fair landscape sportive zephyrs scud, And by kind force display the infant bud. The vegetable kind here rear their head, By kindly showers and heaven's indulgence fed: Of fabled nymphs such were the sacred haunts, But real nymphs this charming dwelling vaunts. Now to the greenhouse let's awhile retire, To shun the heat of Sol's infectious fire: Immortal authors grace this cool retreat, Of ancient times, and of a modern date. Here would my praises and my fancy dwell; But it, alas, description does excel. O may this sweet, this beautiful abode Remain the charge of the eternal God. ON BEAUTY. Beauty deserves the homage of the muse: Shall mine, rebellious, the dear theme refuse? No; while my breast respires the vital air, Wholly I am devoted to the fair. Beauty I'll sing in my sublimest lays, I burn to give her just immortal praise. The heavenly maid with transport I'll pursue To her abode, and all her graces view. This happy place with all delights abounds, And plenty broods upon the fertile grounds. Here verdant grass their waving And hills and vales in sweet confusion lie: The nibbling flock stray o'er the rising hills, And all around with bleating music fills: High on their fronts tall blooming forests nod, Of sylvan deities the blest abode: The feather'd minstrels hop from spray to spray, And chant their gladsome carols all the day; Till dusky night, advancing in her car, Makes with declining light successful war. Then Philomel her mournful lay repeats, And through her throat breathes melancholy sweets. Still higher yet wild rugged rocks arise, And strike beholders with a dread surprise. This paradise these towering hills surround, That thither is one only passage found. Increasing brooks roll down the mountain's side, And as they pass the opposing pebbles chide. But vernal showers refresh the blooming year. Their only season is eternal spring, Which hovers o'er them with a downy wing: Blossoms and fruits at once the trees adorn With glowing blushes, like the rosy morn: The way that to this stately palace goes Of myrtle trees, lies 'twixt two even rows, Which, towering high, with outstretch'd arms display'd, Over our heads a living arch have made. To sing, my muse, the bold attempt begin, Of awful beauties you behold within: The Goddess sat upon a throne of gold, Emboss'd with figures charming to behold; Here new made Eve stood in her early bloom, Not yet obscured with sin's sullen gloom; Her naked beauties do the soul confound, From every part is given a fatal wound; There other beauties of a meaner fame Oblige the sight, whom here I shall not name. In her right hand she did a sceptre sway, O'er all mankind ambitious to obey: Her lovely forehead and her killing eye, Her blushing cheeks of a vermilion dye, Her lip's soft pulp, her heaving snowy breast, Her well turn'd arm, her handsome slender waist, And all below veil'd from the curious eye; Oh! heavenly maid! makes all beholders cry. Her dress was plain, not pompous as a bride, Which would her sweeter native beauties hide. One thing I mind, a spreading hoop she wore, Than nothing which adorns a lady more. With equal rage, could I its beauties sing, I'd with the hoop make all Parnassus ring. Around her shoulders, dangling on her throne, A bright Tartana carelessly was thrown, Which has already won immortal praise, Most sweetly sung in Allan Ramsay's lays; The wanton Cupids did around her play, And smiling loves upon her bosom stray; With purple wings they round about her flew, And her sweet lips tinged with ambrosial dew: Her air was easy, graceful was her mien, Her presence banish'd the ungrateful spleen; In short, her divine influence refined Our corrupt hearts, and polished mankind. Of lovely nymphs she had a smiling train, Fairer than those e'er graced Arcadia's plain. The British ladies next to her took place, Who chiefly did the fair assembly grace. What blooming virgins can Britannia boast, Their praises would all eloquence exhaust. With ladies there my ravish'd eyes did meet, That oft I've seen grace fair Edina's street, With their broad hoops cut through the willing air, Pleased to give place unto the lovely fair: Sure this is like those blissful seats above, Here is peace, transporting joy, and love. Should I be doom'd by cruel angry fate In some lone isle my lingering end to wait, Yet happy I! still happy should I be, While bless'd with virtue and a charming she; With full content I'd fortune's pride despise, And die still gazing on her lovely eyes. May all the blessings mortals need below, May all the blessings heaven can bestow, May every thing that's pleasant, good, or rare, Be the eternal portion of the Fair. A COMPLAINT ON THE MISERIES OF LIFE. I loathe, O Lord, this life below, And all its fading fleeting joys; 'Tis a short space that's fill'd with woe, Which all our bliss by far outweighs. When will the everlasting morn With dawning light the skies adorn? Fitly this life's compared to night, When gloomy darkness shades the sky; Just like the morn's our glimmering light Reflected from the Deity. When will celestial morn dispel These dark surrounding shades of hell? I'm sick of this vexatious state, Where cares invade my peaceful hours; Strike the last blow, O courteous fate, I'll smiling fall like mowed flowers; I'll gladly spurn this clogging clay, And, sweetly singing, soar away. What's money but refined dust? What's honours but an empty name? And what is soft enticing lust, But a consuming idle flame? Yea, what is all beneath the sky But emptiness and vanity? With thousand ills our life's oppress'd, There's nothing here worth living for In the lone grave I long to rest, And be harass'd here no more: Where joy's fantastic, grief's sincere, And where there's nought for which I care. Thy word, O Lord, shall be my guide, Heaven, where thou dwellest is my goal; Through corrupt life grant I may glide With an untainted upward soul. Then may this life, this dreary night, Dispelled be by morning light. AN ELEGY ON PARTING. It was a sad, ay 'twas a sad farewell, I still afresh the pangs of parting feel; Against my breast my heart impatient beat, And in deep sighs bemoan'd its cruel fate; Thus with the object of my love to part, My life! my joy! 'twould rend a rocky heart. Where'er I turn myself, where'er I go, I meet the image of my lovely foe; With witching charms the phantom still appears, And with her wanton smiles insults my tears; Still haunts the places where we used to walk, And where with raptures oft I heard her talk: Those scenes I now with deepest sorrow view, And sighing bid to all delight adieu. While I my head upon this turf recline, Officious sun, in vain on me you shine; In vain unto the smiling fields I hie; In vain the flowery meads salute my eye; In vain the cheerful birds and shepherds sing, And with their carols make the valleys ring; Yea, all the pleasure that the country yield Can't me from sorrow for her absence shield; With divine pleasure books which one inspire, Yea, books themselves I do not now admire. But hark! methinks some pitying power I hear, This welcome message whisper in my ear: âForget thy groundless griefs, dejected swain, You and the nymph you love shall meet again; No more your muse shall sing such mournful lays, But bounteous heaven and your kind mistress praise.â SONG. [When ] When blooming spring Always the laughing fields in green, Then flowers in open air are seen, And warbling birds are heard to sing, Almighty love Doth sweetly move All nature through; Then tell me, Chloe, why are you Averse thereto; When blooming charms Invite your lover's circling arms? O be no longer coy To love and share of joy. A PASTORAL BETWIXT DAVID, THIRSIS, AND THE ANGEL GABRIEL, UPON THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR. DAVID. What means yon apparition in the sky, Thirsis, that dazzles every shepherd's eye? I slumbering was when from yon glorious cloud Came gliding music heavenly, sweet, and loud, With sacred raptures which my bosom fires, And with celestial joy my soul inspires; It soothes the native horrors of the night, And gladdens nature more than dawning light. THIRSIS. But hold, see hither through the yielding air An angel comes: for mighty news prepare. ANGEL GABRIEL. Rejoice, ye swains, anticipate the morn With songs of praise; for lo! a Saviour's born. With joyful haste to Bethlehem repair, And you will find the almighty infant there; Wrapp'd in a swaddling band you'll find your king, And in a manger laid, to him your praises bring. CHORUS OF ANGELS. To God who in the highest dwells, Immortal glory be; Let peace be in the humble cells Of Adam's progeny. DAVID. No more the year shall wintry horrors bring; Fix'd in the indulgence of eternal spring, Immortal green shall clothe the hills and vales, And odorous sweets shall load the balmy gales; The silver brooks shall in soft murmurs tell The joy that shall their oozy channels swell. Feed on, my flocks, and crop the tender grass, Let blooming joy appear on every face; For lo! this blessed, this propitious morn, The Saviour of lost mankind is born. THIRSIS. Thou fairest morn that ever sprang from night, Or deck'd the opening skies with rosy light, Well mayst thou shine with a distinguish'd ray, Since here Emmanuel condescends to stay. Our fears, our guilt, our darkness to dispel, And save us from the horrid jaws of hell. Who from his throne descended, matchless love! To guide poor mortals to bless'd seats above: But come without delay, let us be gone, Shepherd, let's go, and humbly kiss the Son. A PASTORAL BETWEEN THIRSIS AND CORYDON, UPON THE DEATH OF DAMON, BY WHOM IS MEANT MR. W. RIDDELL. Thir. Say, tell me true, what is the doleful cause That Corydon is not the man he was? Your cheerful presence used to lighten cares, And from the plains to banish gloomy fears. Whene'er unto the circling swains you sung Our ravish'd souls upon the music hung; The gazing, listening flocks forgot their meat, While vocal grottos did your lays repeat: But now your gravity our mirth rebukes, And in your downcast and desponding looks Appears some fatal and impending woe; I fear to ask, and yet desire to know. Cor. The doleful news, how shall I, Thirsis, tell! In blooming youth the hapless Damon fell: He's dead, he's dead, and with him all my joy; The mournful thought does all gay forms destroy: This is the cause of my unusual grief, Which sullenly admits of no relief. Thir. Begone all mirth! begone all sports and play, To a deluge of grief and tears give way. Damon the just, the generous, and the young, Must Damon's worth and merit be unsung? No, Corydon, the wondrous youth you knew How as in years so he in virtue grew; Embalm his fame in never dying verse, As a just tribute to his doleful hearse. Cor. Assist me, mighty grief, my breast inspire With generous heats and with thy wildest fire, While in a solemn and a mournful strain Of Damon gone for ever I complain. Ye muses, weep; your mirth and songs forbear, And for him sigh and shed a friendly tear; He was your favourite, and by your aid In charming verse his witty thoughts array'd; He had of knowledge, learning, wit, a store, To it denied he still press'd after more. He was a pious and a virtuous soul, And still press'd forward to the heavenly goal; He was a faithful, true, and constant friend, Faithful, and true, and constant to the end. Ye flowers, hang down and droop your heads, No more around your grateful odours spread; Ye leafy trees, your blooming honours shed, Damon for ever from your shade is fled; Fled to the mansions of eternal light, Where endless wonders strike his happy sight. Ye birds, be mute, as through the trees you fly, Mute as the grave wherein my friend does lie. Ye winds, breathe sighs as through the air you rove, And in sad pomp the trembling branches move. Ye gliding brooks, O weep your channels dry, My flowing tears them fully shall supply; You in soft murmurs may your grief express, And yours, you swains, in mournful songs compress. I to some dark and gloomy shade will fly, Dark as the grave wherein my friend does lie; And for his death to lonely rocks complain In mournful accents and a dying strain, While pining echo answers me again. A PASTORAL ENTERTAINMENT. While in heroic numbers some relate The amazing turns of wise eternal fate; Exploits of heroes in the dusty field, That to their name immortal honour yield; Grant me, ye powers, by the limpid spring The harmless of the plain to sing, A wreath of flowers cull'd from the Is all the my humble muse demands. Now blithsome shepherds, by the early dawn, Their new shorn flocks drive to the dewy lawn; While, in a bleating language, each salutes The welcome morning and their fellow brutes: Then all prepared for the rural feast, And in their finest Sunday habits drest; The crystal brook supplied the mirror's place, they bathed and viewed their cleanly face, and nymphs resorted to the fields pomp the country yields. The place appointed was a spacious vale, Fann'd always by a cooling western gale, Which in soft breezes through the meadows stray, And steals the ripened fragrancies away; Here every shepherd might his flocks survey, Securely roam and take his harmless play; And here were flowers each shepherdess to grace, On her fair bosom courting but a place. How in this vale, beneath a grateful shade, By twining boughs of spreading made, On seats of homely turf themselves they place, And cheerfully enjoyed the rural feast, Consisting of the produce of the fields, And all the luxury the country yields. No maddening liquors spoil'd their harmless mirth, But an untainted spring their thirst allayed, Which in meadows through the valley strayed. Thrice happy swains who spend your golden days In pastime; and when night displays Her sable shade, to peaceful huts retire; Can any man a sweeter bliss desire? In ancient times so pass'd the smiling hour, When our first parents lived in Eden's bower, E'er care and trouble were pronounced, Or sin had blasted the creation THE END.</field>
