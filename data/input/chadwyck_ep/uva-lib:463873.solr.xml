      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND POEMSSquare brackets denote editorial additions or emendations SONGS APPENDED TO SIDNEY'S ASTROPHEL AND STELLA CANTO PRIMO. Harke, all you Ladies that doo sleepe: The Fairie Queene Proserpina Bids you awake, and pitie them that weepe: You may doo in the darke What the day doth forbid: Feare not the doggs that barke, Night will have all hid. But if you let your Lovers mone, The Fairie Queene Proserpina Will send abroad hir Fairies everie one, That shall pinch blacke and blew Your white hands and faire armes, That did not kindly rewe Your Paramours harmes. In myrtle arbours on the downes, The Fairie Queene Proserpina, This night by Moone shine leading merrie rounds, Holds a watch with sweete Love; Downe the dale, up the hill, No plaints nor grieves may move Their holy vigill. All you that will hold watch with Love, The Fairie Queene Proserpina Will make you fairer than Dianas Dove; Roses red, Lillies white, And the cleere damaske hue, Shall on your cheekes alight: Love will adorne you. All you that love, or lov'd before, The Fairie Queene Proserpina Bids you increase that loving humour more: They that have not yet fed On delight amorous, She vowes that they shall lead Apes in Avernus. CANTO SECUNDO. What faire pompe have I spide of glittering Ladies; With locks sparckled abroad, and rosie Coronet On their yvorie browes, trackt to the daintie thies With roabs like Amazons, blew as Violet, With gold Aglets adornd, some in a changeable Pale, with spangs wavering, taught to be moveable. Then those Knights that a farre off with dolorous viewing Cast their eyes hetherward: loe, in an agonie, All unbrac'd, crie aloud, their heavie state ruing: Moyst cheekes with blubbering, painted as Ebonie Blacke; their feltred haire torne with wrathfull hand: And whiles astonied, starke in a maze they stand. But hearke, what merry sound! what sodaine harmonie! Looke, looke neere the grove where the Ladies doe tread With their knights the measures waide by the melodie! Wantons, whose travesing make men enamoured! Now they faine an honor, now by the slender wast He must lift hir aloft, and seale a kisse in hast. Streight downe under a shadow for wearines they lie With pleasant daliance, hand knit with arme in arme; Now close, now set aloof, they gaze with an equall eie, Changing kisses alike; streight with a false alarme, Mocking kisses alike, powt with a lovely lip. Thus drownd with jollities, their merry daies doe slip. But stay! now I discerne they goe on a Pilgrimage Toward Loves holy land, faire Paphos or Cyprus. Such devotion is meete for a blithesome age; With sweet youth it agrees well to be amorous. Let olde angrie fathers lurke in an Hermitage: Come, weele associate this jollie Pilgrimage! CANTO TERTIO. My Love bound me with a kisse That I should no longer staie; When I felt so sweete a blisse, I had lesse power to passe away: Alas, that women do not knowe, Kisses make men loath to goe. CANTO QUARTO. Love whets the dullest wittes, his plagues be such; But makes the wise, by pleasing, doat as much. So wit is purchast by this dire disease: Oh let me doat, so Love be bent to please. CANTO QUINTO. A daie, a night, an houre of sweete content Is worth a world consum'd in fretfull care. Unequall Gods, in your Arbitrement To sort us daies whose sorrowes endles are! And yet what were it? as a fading flower: To swim in blisse a daie, a night, an hower. What plague is greater than the griefe of minde? The griefe of minde that eates in everie vaine, In everie vaine that leaves such clods behind, Such clods behind as breed such bitter paine, So bitter paine that none shall ever finde What plague is greater than the griefe of minde. Doth sorrowe fret thy soule? o direfull spirit! Doth pleasure feede thy heart? o blessed man! Hast thou bin happie once? o heavie plight! Are thy mishaps forepast? o happie than! Or hast thou blisse in eld? o blisse too late! But hast thou blisse in youth? o sweete estate! Finis. CONTENT. A BOOKE OF AYRES, Set foorth to be song to the Lute, Orpherian, and Base Violl, by Philip Rosseter Lutenist: And are to be solde at his house in Fleetstreete neere to the Gray-hound. 1601 TO THE RIGHT VERTUOUS AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR THOMAS MOUNSON. I. [My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love] My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love, And, though the sager sort our deedes reprove, Let us not way them: heav'ns great lampes doe dive Into their west, and strait againe revive, But, soone as once set is our little light, Then must we sleepe one ever-during night. If all would lead their lives in love like mee, Then bloudie swords and armour should not be, No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleepes should move, Unles alar'me came from the campe of love: But fooles do live, and wast their little light, And seeke with paine their ever-during night. When timely death my life and fortune ends, Let not my hearse be vext with mourning friends, But let all lovers, rich in triumph, come, And with sweet pastimes grace my happie tombe; And, Lesbia, close up thou my little light, And crowne with love my ever-during night. II. [Though you are yoong and I am olde] Though you are yoong and I am olde, Though your vaines hot and my bloud colde, Though youth is moist and age is drie, Yet embers live when flames doe die. The tender graft is easely broke, But who shall shake the sturdie Oke? You are more fresh and faire then I, Yet stubs doe live, when flowers doe die. Thou that thy youth doest vainely boast, Know buds are soonest nipt with frost; Thinke that thy fortune still doth crie, Thou foole, tomorrow thou must die. III. [I care not for these Ladies] I care not for these Ladies That must be woode and praide, Give me kind Amarillis The wanton countrey maide; Nature art disdaineth, Her beautie is her owne; Her when we court and kisse, She cries, forsooth, let go: But when we come where comfort is, She never will say no. If I love Amarillis, She gives me fruit and flowers, But if we love these Ladies, We must give golden showers; Give them gold that sell love, Give me the Nutbrowne lasse, Who when we court and kisse, She cries, forsooth, let go: But when we come where comfort is, She never will say no. These Ladies must have pillowes, And beds by strangers wrought, Give me a Bower of willowes, Of mosse and leaves unbought, And fresh Amarillis, With milke and honie fed, Who when we court and kisse, She cries, forsooth, let go: But when we come where comfort is, She never will say no. IV. [Followe thy faire sunne, unhappy shaddowe] Followe thy faire sunne, unhappy shaddowe: Though thou be blacke as night, And she made all of light, Yet follow thy faire sunne, unhappie shaddowe. Follow her whose light thy light depriveth: Though here thou liv'st disgrac't, And she in heaven is plac't, Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth. Follow those pure beames whose beautie burneth, That so have scorched thee, As thou still blacke must bee, Til her kind beames thy black to brightnes turneth. Follow her while yet her glorie shineth: There comes a luckles night, That will dim all her light; And this the black unhappie shade devineth. Follow still since so thy fates ordained: The Sunne must have his shade, Till both at once doe fade, The Sun still prov'd, the shadow still disdained. V. [My love hath vowd hee will forsake mee] My love hath vowd hee will forsake mee, And I am alreadie sped. Far other promise he did make me When he had my maidenhead. If such danger be in playing, And sport must to earnest turne, I will go no more a-maying. Had I foreseene what is ensued, And what now with paine I prove, Unhappie then I had eschewed This unkind event of love: Maides foreknow their own undooing, But feare naught till all is done, When a man alone is wooing. Dissembling wretch, to gaine thy pleasure, What didst thou not vow and sweare? So didst thou rob me of the treasure Which so long I held so deare; Now thou prov'st to me a stranger, Such is the vile guise of men When a woman is in danger. That hart is neerest to misfortune That will trust a fained toong; When flattring men our loves importune, They entend us deepest wrong; If this shame of loves betraying But this once I cleanely shun, I will go no more a-maying. VI. [When to her lute Corrina sings] When to her lute Corrina sings, Her voice revives the leaden stringes, And doth in highest noates appeare As any challeng'd eccho cleere; But when she doth of mourning speake, Ev'n with her sighes the strings do breake. And, as her lute doth live or die, Led by her passion, so must I: For when of pleasure she doth sing, My thoughts enjoy a sodaine spring; But if she doth of sorrow speake, Ev'n from my hart the strings doe breake. VII. [Turne backe, you wanton flyer] Turne backe, you wanton flyer, And answere my desire With mutuall greeting; Yet bende a little neerer, True beauty stil shines cleerer In closer meeting. Harts with harts delighted Should strive to be united, Either others armes with armes enchayning: Harts with a thought, rosie lips With a kisse still entertaining. What harvest halfe so sweete is As still to reape the kisses Growne ripe in sowing, And straight to be receiver Of that which thou art giver, Rich in bestowing? There's no strickt observing Of times, or seasons changing, There is ever one fresh spring abiding: Then what we sow with our lips Let us reape, loves gaines deviding. VIII. [It fell on a sommers day] It fell on a sommers day, While sweete Bessie sleeping laie In her bowre, on her bed, Light with curtaines shadowed; Jamy came, shee him spies, Opning halfe her heavie eies. Jamy stole in through the dore, She lay slumbring as before; Softly to her he drew neere, She heard him, yet would not heare; Bessie vow'd not to speake, He resolv'd that dumpe to breake. First a soft kisse he doth take, She lay still, and would not wake; Then his hands learn'd to woo, She dreamp't not what he would doo, But still slept, while he smild To see love by sleepe beguild. Jamy then began to play, Bessie as one buried lay, Gladly still through this sleight Deceiv'd in her owne deceit; And, since this traunce begoon, She sleepes ev'rie afternoone. IX. [The Sypres curten of the night is spread] The Sypres curten of the night is spread, And over all a silent dewe is cast. The weaker cares by sleepe are conquered; But I alone, with hidious griefe agast, In spite of Morpheus charmes a watch doe keepe Over mine eies, to banish carelesse sleepe. Yet oft my trembling eyes through faintnes close, And then the Mappe of hell before me stands, Which Ghosts doe see, and I am one of those Ordain'd to pine in sorrowes endles bands, Since from my wretched soule all hopes are reft And now no cause of life to me is left. Griefe, ceaze my soule, for that will still endure When my cras'd bodie is consum'd and gone; Beare it to thy blacke denne, there keepe it sure, Where thou ten thousand soules doest tyre upon: Yet all doe not affoord such foode to thee As this poore one, the worser part of mee. X. [Follow your Saint, follow with accents sweet] Follow your Saint, follow with accents sweet, Haste you, sad noates, fall at her flying feete; There, wrapt in cloud of sorrowe, pitie move, And tell the ravisher of my soule I perish for her love. But if she scorns my never-ceasing paine, Then burst with sighing in her sight, and nere returne againe. All that I soong still to her praise did tend, Still she was first, still she my songs did end. Yet she my love and Musicke both doeth flie, The Musicke that her Eccho is, and beauties simpathie; Then let my Noates pursue her scornefull flight: It shall suffice that they were breath'd, and dyed, for her delight. XI. [Faire, if you expect admiring] Faire, if you expect admiring, Sweet, if you provoke desiring, Grace deere love with kinde requiting. Fond, but if thy sight be blindnes, False, if thou affect unkindnes, Flie both love and loves delighting. Then when hope is lost and love is scorned, Ile bury my desires, and quench the fires that ever yet in vaine have burned. Fates, if you rule lovers fortune, Stars, if men your powers importune, Yield reliefe by your relenting. Time, if sorrow be not endles, Hope made vaine, and pittie friendles, Helpe to ease my long lamenting. But if griefes remaine still unredressed, I'le flie to her againe, and sue for pitie to renue my hopes distressed. XII. [Thou art not faire, for all thy red and white] Thou art not faire, for all thy red and white, For all those rosie ornaments in thee; Thou art not sweet, though made of meer delight, Nor faire nor sweet, unlesse thou pitie mee. I will not sooth thy fancies: thou shalt prove That beauty is no beautie without love. Yet love not me, nor seeke thou to allure My thoughts with beautie, were it more devine; Thy smiles and kisses I cannot endure, I'le not be wrapt up in those armes of thine. Now shew it, if thou be a woman right: Embrace, and kisse, and love me, in despight. XIII. [See where she flies enrag'd from me] See where she flies enrag'd from me, View her when she intends despite: The winde is not more swift then shee, Her furie mov'd such terror makes As, to a fearfull guiltie sprite, The voice of heav'ns huge thunder cracks. But, when her appeased minde yeelds to delight, All her thoughts are made of joyes, Millions of delights inventing: Other pleasures are but toies To her beauties sweete contenting. My fortune hangs upon her brow, For, as she smiles or frownes on mee, So must my blowne affections bow; And her proude thoughts too well do find With what unequall tyrannie Her beauties doe command my mind. Though, when her sad planet raignes, froward she bee, She alone can pleasure move, And displeasing sorrow banish: May I but still hold her love, Let all other comforts vanish. XIV. [Blame not my cheeks, though pale with love they be] Blame not my cheeks, though pale with love they be; The kindly heate unto my heart is flowne, To cherish it that is dismaid by thee, Who art so cruell and unsteedfast growne: For nature, cald for by distressed harts, Neglects and quite forsakes the outward partes. But they whose cheekes with careles blood are stain'd Nurse not one sparke of love within their harts, And, when they woe, they speake with passion fain'd, For their fat love lyes in their outward parts: But in their brests, where love his court should hold, Poore Cupid sits and blowes his nailes for cold. XV. [When the God of merrie love] When the God of merrie love As yet in his cradle lay, Thus his wither'd nurse did say: Thou a wanton boy wilt prove To deceive the powers above; For by thy continuall smiling I see thy power of beguiling. Therewith she the babe did kisse, When a sodaine fire out came From those burning lips of his, That did her with love enflame; But none would regard the same, So that, to her daie of dying, The old wretch liv'd ever crying. XVI. [Mistris, since you so much desire] Mistris, since you so much desire To know the place of Cupids fire, In your faire shrine that flame doth rest, Yet never harbourd in your brest; It bides not in your lips so sweete, Nor where the rose and lillies meete, But a little higher, but a little higher: There, there, O there lies Cupids fire. Even in those starrie pearcing eyes, There Cupids sacred fire lyes; Those eyes I strive not to enjoy, For they have power to destroy; Nor woe I for a smile, or kisse, So meanely triumph's not my blisse; But a little higher, but a little higher, I climbe to crowne my chast desire. XVII. [Your faire lookes enflame my desire] Your faire lookes enflame my desire: Quench it againe with love. Stay, O strive not still to retire, Doe not inhumane prove. If love may perswade, Loves pleasures, deere, denie not; Heere is a silent grovie shade: O tarrie then, and flie not. Have I seaz'd my heavenly delight In this unhaunted grove? Time shall now her furie requite With the revenge of love. Then come, sweetest, come, My lips with kisses gracing: Here let us harbour all alone, Die, die in sweete embracing. Will you now so timely depart, And not returne againe? Your sight lends such life to my hart That to depart is paine. Feare yeelds no delay, Securenes helpeth pleasure: Then, till the time gives safer stay, O farewell, my lives treasure! XVIII. [The man of life upright] The man of life upright, Whose guiltlesse hart is free From all dishonest deedes, Or thought of vanitie, The man whose silent dayes In harmeles joyes are spent, Whome hopes cannot delude, Nor sorrow discontent, That man needes neither towers Nor armour for defence, Nor secret vautes to flie From thunders violence. Hee onely can behold With unafrighted eyes The horrours of the deepe, And terrours of the Skies. Thus, scorning all the cares That fate, or fortune brings, He makes the heav'n his booke, His wisedome heev'nly things, Good thoughts his onely friendes, His wealth a well-spent age, The earth his sober Inne, And quiet Pilgrimage. XIX. [Harke, al you ladies that do sleep] Harke, al you ladies that do sleep: the fayry queen Proserpina Bids you awake and pitie them that weep; you may doe in the darke What the day doth forbid: feare not the dogs that barke, Night will have all hid. But if you let your lovers mone, the Fairie Queene Proserpina Will send abroad her Fairies ev'rie one, that shall pinch blacke and blew Your white hands, and faire armes, that did not kindly rue Your Paramours harmes. In Myrtle Arbours on the downes, the Fairie Queene Proserpina, This night by moone-shine leading merrie rounds, holds a watch with sweet love; Downe the dale, up the hill, no plaints or groanes may move Their holy vigill. All you that will hold watch with love, the Fairie Queene Proserpina Will make you fairer then Diones dove; Roses red, Lillies white, And the cleare damaske hue, shall on your cheekes alight: Love will adorne you. All you that love, or lov'd before, the Fairie Queene Proserpina Bids you encrease that loving humour more: they that yet have not fed On delight amorous, she vowes that they shall lead Apes in Avernus. XX. [When thou must home to shades of under ground] When thou must home to shades of under ground, And there ariv'd, a newe admired guest, The beauteous spirits do ingirt thee round, White Iope, blith Hellen, and the rest, To heare the stories of thy finisht love, From that smoothe toong whose musicke hell can move: Then wilt thou speake of banqueting delights, Of masks and revels which sweete youth did make, Of Turnies and great challenges of knights, And all these triumphes for thy beauties sake: When thou hast told these honours done to thee, Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murther me. XXI. Come, let us sound with melody the praises Come, let us sound with melody the praises Of the kings king, th'omnipotent creator, Author of number, that hath all the world in Harmonie framed. Heav'n is his throne perpetually shining, His devine power and glorie thence he thunders, One in all, and all still in one abiding, Both Father, and Sonne. O sacred sprite, invisible, eternall, Ev'ry where, yet unlimited, that all things Canst in one moment penetrate, revive me, O holy Spirit. Rescue, O rescue me from earthly darknes, Banish hence all these elementall objects, Guide my soule that thirsts to the lively Fountaine Of thy devinenes. Cleanse my soule, O God, thy bespotted Image, Altered with sinne so that heav'nly purenes Cannot acknowledge me but in thy mercies, O Father of grace. But when once thy beames do remove my darknes, O then I'le shine forth as an Angell of light, And record, with more than an earthly voice, thy Infinite honours. FINIS. TWO BOOKES OF AYRES. THE FIRST Contayning Divine and Morall Songs: THE SECOND, Light Conceits of Lovers. To be sung to the Lute and Viols, in two, three, and foure Parts: or by one Voyce to an INSTRUMENT. Composed By Thomas Campian. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, BOTH in Birth and Vertue, FRANCIS, Earle of CUMBERLAND. What Patron could I chuse, great Lord, but you? Grave words your years may challenge as their owne, And ev'ry note of Musicke is your due, Whose House the Muses pallace I have knowne. To love and cherish them, though it descends With many honours more on you, in vaine Preceding fame herein with you contends, Who have both fed the Muses, and their trayne. These Leaves I offer you, Devotion might Her selfe lay open, reade them, or else heare How gravely with their tunes they yeeld delight To any vertuous, and not curious eare. Such as they are accept them, Noble Lord; If better, better could my zeale afford. Your Honors, THOMAS CAMPIAN. THE FIRST BOOKE [Songs of 4. Parts.] I. [Author of light, revive my dying spright] Author of light, revive my dying spright, Redeeme it from the snares of all-confounding night. Lord, light me to thy blessed way: For, blinde with worldly vaine desires, I wander as a stray. Sunne and Moone, Starres and underlights I see, But all their glorious beames are mists and darknes, being compar'd to thee. Fountaine of health, my soules deepe wounds recure, Sweet showres of pitty raine, wash my uncleannesse pure. One drop of thy desired grace The faint and fading hart can raise, and in joyes bosome place. Sinne and Death, Hell and tempting Fiends may rage; But God his owne will guard, and their sharp paines and griefe in time asswage. II. [The man of life upright] The man of life upright, Whose chearfull minde is free From waight of impious deedes, And yoake of vanitee, The man whose silent dayes In harmelesse joyes are spent: Whom hopes cannot delude, Nor sorrowes discontent, That man needes neyther towres, Nor armour for defence: Nor vaults his guilt to shrowd From thunders violence; Hee onely can behold With unaffrighted eyes The horrors of the deepe, And terrors of the Skies. Thus, scorning all the cares That fate or fortune brings, His Booke the Heav'ns hee makes, His wisedome heav'nly things. Good thoughts his surest friends, His wealth a well-spent age, The earth his sober Inne, And quiet pilgrimage. III. [Where are all thy beauties now, all harts enchayning?] Where are all thy beauties now, all harts enchayning? Whither are thy flatt'rers gone with all their fayning? All fled; and thou alone still here remayning. Thy rich state of twisted gold to Bayes is turned; Cold as thou art, are thy loves that so much burned: Who dye in flatt'rers armes are seldome mourned. Yet, in spight of envie, this be still proclaymed, That none worthyer then thy selfe thy worth hath blamed: When their poore names are lost, thou shalt live famed. When thy story, long time hence, shall be perused, Let the blemish of thy rule be thus excused: None ever liv'd more just, none more abused. IV. [Out of my soules deapth to thee my cryes have sounded] Out of my soules deapth to thee my cryes have sounded: Let thine eares my plaints receive, on just feare grounded. Lord, should'st thou weigh our faults, who's not confounded? But with grace thou censur'st thine when they have erred, Therefore shall thy blessed name be lov'd and feared: Ev'n to thy throne my thoughts and eyes are reared. Thee alone my hopes attend, on thee relying; In thy sacred word I'le trust, to thee fast flying, Long ere the Watch shall breake, the morne descrying. In the mercies of our God who live secured, May of full redemption rest in him assured; Their sinne-sicke soules by him shall be recured. V. [View mee, Lord, a worke of thine] View mee, Lord, a worke of thine: Shall I then lye drown'd in night? Might thy grace in mee but shine, I should seeme made all of light. But my soule still surfets so On the poysoned baytes of sinne, That I strange and ugly growe, All is darke and foule within. Clense mee, Lord, that I may kneele At thine Altar, pure and white: They that once thy Mercies feele Gaze no more on earths delight. Worldly joyes like shadowes fade, When the heav'nly light appeares; But the cov'nants thou hast made, Endlesse, know nor dayes, nor yeares. In thy word, Lord, is my trust, To thy mercies fast I flye; Though I am but clay and dust, Yet thy grace can lift me high. VI. [Bravely deckt, come forth, bright day] Bravely deckt, come forth, bright day, Thine houres with Roses strew thy way, As they well remember. Thou receiv'd shalt be with feasts: Come, chiefest of the British ghests, Thou fift of November. Thou with triumph shalt exceede In the strictest ember; For by thy returne the Lord records his blessed deede. Britaines, frolicke at your bourd, But first sing praises to the Lord In your Congregations. Hee preserv'd your state alone, His loving grace hath made you one Of his chosen Nations. But this light must hallowed be With your best Oblations; Prayse the Lord, for onely great and mercifull is hee. Death had enter'd in the gate, And ruine was crept neare the State; But heav'n all revealed. Fi'ry Power hell did make, Which, ready long the flame to take, Lay in shade concealed. God us helpt of his free grace, None to him appealed; For none was so bad to feare the treason or the place. God his peacefull Monarch chose, To him the mist he did disclose, To him, and none other; This hee did, O King, for thee, That thou thine owne renowne might'st see, Which no time can smother. May blest Charles thy comfort be, Firmer then his Brother: May his heart the love of peace, and wisedome learne from thee. VII. [To Musicke bent is my retyred minde] To Musicke bent is my retyred minde, And faine would I some song of pleasure sing: But in vaine joyes no comfort now I finde: From heav'nly thoughts all true delight doth spring. Thy power, O God, thy mercies to record Will sweeten ev'ry note, and ev'ry word. All earthly pompe or beauty to expresse, Is but to carve in snow, on waves to write. Celestiall things, though men conceive them lesse, Yet fullest are they in themselves of light: Such beames they yeeld as know no meanes to dye: Such heate they cast as lifts the Spirit high. VIII. [Tune thy Musicke to thy hart] Tune thy Musicke to thy hart, Sing thy joy with thankes, and so thy sorrow: Though Devotion needes not Art, Sometime of the poore the rich may borrow. Strive not yet for curious wayes: Concord pleaseth more, the lesse 'tis strained; Zeale affects not outward prayse, Onely strives to shew a love unfained. Love can wondrous things effect, Sweetest Sacrifice, all wrath appeasing; Love the highest doth respect, Love alone to him is ever pleasing. IX. [Most sweet and pleasing are thy wayes, O God] Most sweet and pleasing are thy wayes, O God, Like Meadowes deckt with Christall streames and flowers: Thy paths no foote prophane hath ever trod, Nor hath the proud man rested in thy Bowers. There lives no Vultur, no devouring Beare, But onely Doves and Lambs are harbor'd there. The Wolfe his young ones to their prey doth guide; The Foxe his Cubbs with false deceit endues; The Lyons Whelpe suckes from his Damme his pride; In hers the Serpent malice doth infuse: The darksome Desart all such beasts contaynes, Not one of them in Paradice remaynes. X. [Wise men patience never want] Wise men patience never want, Good men pitty cannot hide: Feeble spirits onely vant Of revenge, the poorest pride. Hee alone forgive that can Beares the true soule of a man. Some there are, debate that seeke, Making trouble their content, Happy if they wrong the meeke, Vexe them that to peace are bent: Such undooe the common tye Of mankinde, societie. Kindnesse growne is, lately, colde; Conscience hath forgot her part; Blessed times were knowne of old, Long ere Law became an Art: Shame deterr'd, not Statutes then, Honest love was law to men. Deeds from love, and words, that flowe Foster like kinde Aprill showres; In the warme Sunne all things grow, Wholsome fruits and pleasant flowres; All so thrives his gentle rayes, Where on humane love displayes. XI. [Never weather-beaten Saile more willing bent to shore] Never weather-beaten Saile more willing bent to shore, Never tyred Pilgrims limbs affected slumber more, Then my weary spright now longs to flye out of my troubled brest. O come quickly, sweetest Lord, and take my soule to rest. Ever-blooming are the joyes of Heav'ns high paradice, Cold age deafes not there our eares, nor vapour dims our eyes; Glory there the Sun outshines, whose beames the blessed onely see: O come quickly, glorious Lord, and raise my spright to thee. XII. [Lift up to heav'n, sad wretch, thy heavy spright] Lift up to heav'n, sad wretch, thy heavy spright, What though thy sinnes thy due destruction threat? The Lord exceedes in mercy as in might; His ruth is greater, though thy crimes be great. Repentance needes not feare the heav'ns just rod, It stayes ev'n thunder in the hand of God. With chearefull voyce to him then cry for grace, Thy Faith, and fainting Hope, with Prayer revive; Remorce for all that truely mourne hath place; Not God, but men of him themselves deprive: Strive then, and hee will help; call him, hee'll heare: The Sonne needes not the Fathers fury feare. XIII. [Loe, when backe mine eye] Loe, when backe mine eye, Pilgrim-like, I cast, What fearefull wayes I spye, Which, blinded, I securely past! But now heav'n hath drawne From my browes that night; As when the day doth dawne, So cleares my long imprison'd sight. Straight the caves of hell Drest with flowres I see, Wherein false pleasures dwell, That, winning most, most deadly be. Throngs of masked Feinds, Wing'd like Angels, flye, Ev'n in the gates of Friends; In faire disguise blacke dangers lye. Straight to Heav'n I rais'd My restored sight, And with loud voyce I prais'd The Lord of ever-during light. And, since I had stray'd From his wayes so wide, His grace I humbly pray'd Hence-forth to be my guard and guide. XIV. [As by the streames of Babilon] As by the streames of Babilon, Farre from our native soyle we sat, Sweet Sion, thee we thought upon, And ev'ry thought a teare begat. Aloft the trees that spring up there Our silent Harps wee pensive hung: Said they that captiv'd us, Let's heare Some song which you in Sion sung. Is then the song of our God fit To be prophan'd in forraine land? O Salem, thee when I forget, Forget his skill may my right hand! Fast to the roofe cleave may my tongue, If mindelesse I of thee be found: Or if, when all my joyes are sung, Jerusalem be not the ground. Remember, Lord, how Edoms race Cryed in Jerusalems sad day, Hurle downe her wals, her towres deface; And, stone by stone, all levell lay. Curst Babels seede! for Salems sake Just ruine yet for thee remaines! Blest shall they be, thy babes that take, And 'gainst the stones dash out their braines! XV. [Sing a song of joy] Sing a song of joy, Prayse our God with mirth: His flocke who can destroy? Is hee not Lord of heav'n and earth? Sing wee then secure, Tuning well our strings: With voyce, as Eccho pure, Let us renowne the King of Kings. First who taught the day From the East to rise? Whom doth the Sunne obey When in the Seas his glory dyes? Hee the Starres directs That in order stand: Who heav'n and earth protects, But hee that fram'd them with his hand? Angels round attend, Wayting on his will; Arm'd millions he doth send To ayde the good or plague the ill. All that dread his Name, And his Hests observe, His arme will shield from shame: Their steps from truth shall never swerve. Let us then rejoyce, Sounding loud his prayse: So will hee heare our voyce, And blesse on earth our peacefull dayes. XVI. [Awake, awake, thou heavy spright] Awake, awake, thou heavy spright, That sleep'st the deadly sleepe of sinne; Rise now, and walke the wayes of light: 'Tis not too late yet to begin. Seeke heav'n earely, seeke it late, True Faith still findes an open gate. Get up, get up, thou leaden man: Thy tracks to endlesse joy or paine Yeelds but the modell of a span; Yet burnes out thy lifes lampe in vaine. One minute bounds thy bane, or blisse, Then watch, and labour while time is. [Songs of 3. Parts.] XVII. [Come, chearfull day, part of my life, to mee] Come, chearfull day, part of my life, to mee: For, while thou view'st me with thy fading light, Part of my life doth still depart with thee, And I still onward haste to my last night. Times fatall wings doe ever forward flye, Soe ev'ry day we live, a day wee dye. But, O yee nights ordain'd for barren rest, How are my dayes depriv'd of life in you, When heavy sleepe my soule hath dispossest, By fayned death life sweetly to renew! Part of my life, in that, you life denye: So ev'ry day we live, a day wee dye. XVIII. [Seeke the Lord, and in his wayes persever] Seeke the Lord, and in his wayes persever: O faint not, but as Eagles flye, For his steepe hill is high; Then, striving, gaine the top, and triumph ever. When with glory there thy browes are crowned, New joyes so shall abound in thee, Such sights thy soule shall see, That wordly thoughts shall by their beames be drowned. Farewell, World, thou masse of meere confusion, False light with many shadowes dimm'd, Old Witch with new foyles trimm'd, Thou deadly sleepe of soule, and charm'd illusion. I the King will seeke of Kings adored, Spring of light, tree of grace and blisse, Whose fruit so sov'raigne is That all who taste it are from death restored. XIX. [Lighten, heavy hart, thy spright] Lighten, heavy hart, thy spright, The joyes recall that thence are fled; Yeeld thy brest some living light: The man that nothing doth is dead. Tune thy temper to these sounds, And quicken so thy joylesse minde; Sloth the worst and best confounds: It is the ruine of mankinde. From her cave rise all distasts, Which unresolv'd Despaire pursues; Whom soone after Violence hasts, Her selfe ungratefull to abuse. Skies are clear'd with stirring windes, Th'unmoved water moorish growes; Ev'ry eye much pleasure findes To view a streame that brightly flowes. XX. [Jacke and Jone, they thinke no ill] Jacke and Jone, they thinke no ill, But loving live, and merry still; Doe their weeke dayes worke, and pray Devotely on the holy day; Skip and trip it on the greene, And help to chuse the Summer Queene; Lash out, at a Country Feast, Their silver penny with the best. Well can they judge of nappy Ale, And tell at large a Winter tale; Climbe up to the Apple loft, And turne the Crabs till they be soft. Tib is all the fathers joy, And little Tom the mothers boy. All their pleasure is content; And care, to pay their yearely rent. Jone can call by name her Cowes, And decke her windowes with greene boughs; Shee can wreathes and tuttyes make, And trimme with plums a Bridall Cake. Jacke knowes what brings gaine or losse, And his long Flaile can stoutly tosse; Make the hedge, which others breake, And ever thinkes what he doth speake. Now, you Courtly Dames and Knights, That study onely strange delights, Though you scorne the home-spun gray, And revell in your rich array; Though your tongues dissemble deepe, And can your heads from danger keepe; Yet, for all your pompe and traine, Securer lives the silly Swaine. [Songs of 2. Parts.] XXI. [All lookes be pale, harts cold as stone.] All lookes be pale, harts cold as stone. For Hally now is dead, and gone, Hally, in whose sight, Most sweet sight, All the earth late tooke delight. Ev'ry eye, weepe with mee, Joyes drown'd in teares must be. His Iv'ry skin, his comely hayre, His Rosie cheekes, so cleare and faire, Eyes that once did grace His bright face, Now in him all want their place. Eyes and hearts, weepe with mee, For who so kinde as hee? His youth was like an Aprill flowre, Adorn'd with beauty, love, and powre; Glory strow'd his way, Whose wreaths gay Now are all turn'd to decay. Then againe weepe with mee, None feele more cause then wee. No more may his wisht sight returne, His golden Lampe no more can burne; Quencht is all his flame, His hop't fame Now hath left him nought but name. For him all weepe with mee, Since more him none shall see. THE SECOND BOOKE OF AYRES. Containing Light Conceits of Lovers. TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, AND VERTUOUS, HENRY LORD CLIFFORD, Sonne and Heyre to the Right Honourable, FRANCIS, Earle of CUMBERLAND. Such dayes as weare the badge of holy red Are for devotion markt, and sage delight; The vulgar Low-dayes, undistinguished, Are left for labour, games, and sportfull sights. This sev'rall and so diff'ring use of Time Within th'enclosure of one weeke wee finde; Which I resemble in my Notes and Rime, Expressing both in their peculiar kinde. Pure Hymnes, such as the seaventh day loves, doe leade; Grave age did justly chalenge those of mee: These weeke-day workes, in order that succeede, Your youth best fits, and yours, yong Lord, they be: As hee is, who to them their beeing gave; If th'one, the other you of force must have. Your Honors, THOMAS CAMPIAN. TO THE READER. That holy Hymnes with Lovers cares are knit Both in one Quire here, thou maist think't unfit; Why do'st not blame the Stationer as well, Who in the same Shop sets all sorts to sell? Divine with stiles prophane, grave shelv'd with vaine; And some matcht worse, yet none of him complaine. [Songs of 3. Parts.] I. [Vaine men, whose follies make a God of Love] Vaine men, whose follies make a God of Love, Whose blindnesse beauty doth immortall deeme: Prayse not what you desire, but what you prove, Count those things good that are, not those that seeme: I cannot call her true that's false to me, Nor make of women more then women be. How faire an entrance breakes the way to love! How rich of golden hope, and gay delight! What hart cannot a modest beauty move? Who, seeing cleare day once, will dreame of night? Shee seem'd a Saint, that brake her faith with mee, But prov'd a woman, as all other be. So bitter is their sweet, that true content Unhappy men in them may never finde; Ah, but without them, none; both must consent, Else uncouth are the joyes of eyther kinde. Let us then prayse their good, forget their ill: Men must be men, and women women still. II. [How eas'ly wert thou chained] How eas'ly wert thou chained, Fond hart, by favours fained! Why liv'd thy hopes in grace, Straight to dye disdained? But, since th'art now beguiled By Love that falsely smiled, In some lesse happy place Mourne alone exiled. My love still here increaseth, And with my love my griefe, While her sweet bounty ceaseth, That gave my woes reliefe. Yet 'tis no woman leaves me, For such may prove unjust: A Goddesse thus deceives me, Whose faith who could mistrust? A Goddesse so much graced That Paradice is placed In her most heav'nly brest, Once by love embraced; But love, that so kinde proved, Is now from her removed, Nor will he longer rest Where no faith is loved. If Powres Celestiall wound us And will not yeeld reliefe, Woe then must needs confound us, For none can cure our griefe. No wonder if I languish Through burden of my smart; It is no common anguish From Paradice to part. III. [Harden now thy tyred hart with more then flinty rage] Harden now thy tyred hart with more then flinty rage; Ne'er let her false teares henceforth thy constant griefe asswage. Once true happy dayes thou saw'st, when shee stood firme and kinde, Both as one then liv'd, and held one eare, one tongue, one minde. But now those bright houres be fled, and never may returne: What then remaines, but her untruths to mourne? Silly Tray-tresse, who shall now thy carelesse tresses place? Who thy pretty talke supply? whose eare thy musicke grace? Who shall thy bright eyes admire? what lips triumph with thine? Day by day who'll visit thee and say, th'art onely mine? Such a time there was, God wot, but such shall never be: Too oft, I feare, thou wilt remember me. IV. [O what unhop't for sweet supply!] O what unhop't for sweet supply! O what joyes exceeding! What an affecting charme feele I, From delight proceeding! That which I long despair'd to be, To her I am, and shee to mee. Shee that alone in cloudy griefe Long to mee appeared, Shee now alone with bright reliefe All those clouds hath cleared. Both are immortall, and divine, Since I am hers, and she is mine. V. [Where shee her sacred bowre adornes] Where shee her sacred bowre adornes, The Rivers clearely flow: The groves and medowes swell with flowres, The windes all gently blow: Her Sunne-like beauty shines so fayre, Her Spring can never fade: Who then can blame the life that strives To harbour in her shade? Her grace I sought, her love I wooed; Her love though I obtaine, No time, no toyle, no vow, no faith Her wished grace can gaine. Yet truth can tell my heart is hers, And her will I adore: And from that love when I depart, Let heav'n view me no more. Her roses with my prayer shall spring; And when trees I praise, Their boughs shall blossome, mellow fruit Shall straw her pleasant wayes. The words of harty zeale have powre High wonders to effect; O why should then her Princely eare My words, or zeale neglect? If shee my faith misdeemes, or worth, Woe-worth my haplesse fate: For, though time can my truth reveale, That time will come too late. And who can glory in the worth That cannot yeeld him grace? Content in ev'ry thing is not, Nor joy in ev'ry place. But, from her bowre of Joy since I Must now excluded be, And shee will not relieve my cares, Which none can helpe but shee: My comfort in her love shall dwell, Her love lodge in my brest; And though not in her bowre, yet I Shall in her temple rest. VI. [Faine would I my love disclose] Faine would I my love disclose, Aske what honour might denye; But both love and her I lose, From my motion if shee flye. Worse then paine is feare to mee: Then hold in fancy, though it burne; If not happy, safe Ile be, And to my clostred cares returne. Yet, o yet, in vaine I strive To represse my school'd desire; More and more the flames revive, I consume in mine owne fire. She would pitty, might shee know The harmes that I for her endure: Speake then, and get comfort so: A wound long hid growes past recure. Wise shee is, and needs must know All th'attempts that beauty moves: Fayre she is, and honour'd so That she, sure, hath tryed some loves. If with love I tempt her then, 'Tis but her due to be desir'd: What would women thinke of men, If their deserts were not admir'd? Women, courted, have the hand To discard what they distaste: But those Dames whom none demand Want oft what their wils imbrac't. Could their firmnesse iron excell, As they are faire, they should be sought: When true theeves use falsehood well, As they are wise, they will be caught. VII. [Give beauty all her right] Give beauty all her right, Shee's not to one forme tyed; Each shape yeelds faire delight, Where her perfections bide. Hellen, I grant, might pleasing be; And Ros'mond was as sweet as shee. Some the quicke eye commends, Some smelling lips and red; Pale lookes have many friends, Through sacred sweetnesse bred. Medowes have flowres that pleasure move, Though Roses are the flowres of love. Free beauty is not bound To one unmoved clime: She visits ev'ry ground, And favours ev'ry time. Let the old loves with mine compare, My sov'raigne is as sweet, and fayre. VIII. [O deare, that I with thee might live] O deare, that I with thee might live, From humane trace removed: Where jealous care might neither grieve, Yet each dote on their loved. While fond feare may colour finde, Love's seldome pleased; But much like a sicke mans rest, it's soone diseased. Why should our mindes not mingle so, When love and faith is plighted, That eyther might the others know, Alike in all delighted? Why should frailtie breed suspect, when hearts are fixed? Must all humane joyes of force with griefe be mixed? How oft have wee ev'n smilde in teares, Our fond mistrust repenting? As snow when heav'nly fire appeares, So melts loves hate relenting. Vexed kindnesse soone fals off, and soone returneth: Such a flame the more you quench, the more it burneth. IX. [Good men, shew, if you can tell] Good men, shew, if you can tell, Where doth humane pittie dwell? Farre and neere her would I seeke, So vext with sorrow is my brest. She (they say) to all is meeke, And onely makes th'unhappie blest. Oh! if such a Saint there be, Some hope yet remaines for me: Prayer or sacrifice may gaine From her implored grace reliefe, To release mee of my paine, Or at the least to ease my griefe. Young am I, and farre from guile; The more is my woe the while: Falshood with a smooth disguise My simple meaning hath abus'd, Casting mists before mine eyes, By which my senses are confus'd. Faire he is, who vow'd to me That he onely mine would be: But, alas, his minde is caught With ev'ry gaudie bait he sees. And too late my flame is taught That too much kindnesse makes men freese. From me all my friends are gone, While I pine for him alone; And not one will rue my case, But rather my distresse deride: That I thinke there is no place Where pittie ever yet did bide. X. [What harvest halfe so sweet is] What harvest halfe so sweet is, As still to reape the kisses Growne ripe in sowing? And straight to be receiver Of that which thou art giver, Rich in bestowing? Kisse then, my harvest Queene, Full garners heaping; Kisses, ripest when th'are greene, Want onely reaping. The Dove alone expresses Her fervencie in kisses, Of all most loving: A creature as offencelesse As those things that are sencelesse And void of moving. Let us so love and kisse, Though all envie us: That which kinde, and harmelesse is, None can denie us. XI. [Sweet, exclude mee not, nor be divided] Sweet, exclude mee not, nor be divided From him that ere long must bed thee: All thy maiden doubts Law hath decided; Sure wee are, and I must wed thee. Presume then yet a little more: Here's the way, barre not the dore. Tenants, to fulfill their Land-lords pleasure, Pay their rent before the quarter: 'Tis my case, if you it rightly measure; Put mee not then off with laughter. Consider then a little more: Here's the way to all my store. Why were dores in loves despight devised? Are not Lawes enough restrayning? Women are most apt to be surprised Sleeping, or sleepe wisely fayning. Then grace me yet a little more: Here's the way, barre not the dore. XII. [The peacefull westerne winde] The peacefull westerne winde The winter stormes hath tam'd, And nature in each kinde The kinde heat hath inflam'd. The forward buds so sweetly breathe Out of their earthy bowers, That heav'n, which viewes their pompe beneath, Would faine be deckt with flowers. See how the morning smiles On her bright easterne hill, And with soft steps beguiles Them that lie slumbring still. The musicke-loving birds are come From cliffes and rockes unknowne, To see the trees and briers blome That late were over-flowne. What Saturne did destroy, Loves Queene revives againe; And now her naked boy Doth in the fields remaine: Where he such pleasing change doth view In ev'ry living thing, As if the world were borne anew To gratifie the Spring. If all things life present, Why die my comforts then? Why suffers my content? Am I the worst of men? O beautie, be not thou accus'd Too justly in this case: Unkindly if true love be us'd, 'Twill yeeld thee little grace. XIII. [There is none, O none but you] There is none, O none but you, That from mee estrange your sight, Whom mine eyes affect to view Or chained eares heare with delight. Other beauties others move, In you I all graces finde: Such is the effect of love, To make them happy that are kinde. Women in fraile beauty trust, Onely seeme you faire to mee; Yet prove truely kinde and just, For that may not dissembled be. Sweet, afford mee then your sight, That, survaying all your lookes, Endlesse volumes I may write, And fill the world with envyed bookes: Which when after ages view, All shall wonder, and despaire, Woman to finde man so true, Or man a woman halfe so faire. XIV. [Pin'd I am, and like to die] Pin'd I am, and like to die, And all for lacke of that which I Doe ev'ry day refuse. If I musing sit, or stand, Some puts it daily in my hand, To interrupt my muse. The same thing I seeke, and flie, And want that which none would denie. In my bed, when I should rest, It breeds such trouble in my brest That scarce mine eyes will close: If I sleepe, it seemes to be Oft playing in the bed with me, But, wak't, away it goes. Tis some spirit, sure, I weene, And yet it may be felt, and seene. Would I had the heart and wit To make it stand, and conjure it, That haunts me thus with feare. Doubtlesse tis some harmlesse spright, For it by day, as well as night, Is ready to appeare. Be it friend, or be it foe, Ere long Ile trie what it will doe. XV. [So many loves have I neglected] So many loves have I neglected Whose good parts might move mee, That now I live of all rejected, There is none will love me. Why is mayden heate so coy? It freezeth when it burneth, Looseth what it might injoy, And, having lost it, mourneth. Should I then wooe, that have been wooed, Seeking them that flye mee? When I my faith with teares have vowed, And when all denye mee, Who will pitty my disgrace, Which love might have prevented? There is no submission base Where error is repented. O happy men, whose hopes are licenc'd To discourse their passion, While women are confin'd to silence, Loosing wisht occasion. Yet our tongues then theirs, men say, Are apter to be moving: Women are more dumbe then they, But in their thoughts more roving. When I compare my former strangenesse With my present doting, I pitty men that speake in plainenesse, Their true hearts devoting; While wee with repentance jest At their submissive passion: Maydes, I see, are never blest That strange be but for fashion. XVI. [Though your strangenesse frets my hart] Though your strangenesse frets my hart, Yet may not I complaine: You perswade me, 'tis but Art, That secret love must faine. If another you affect, 'Tis but a shew t'avoid suspect. Is this faire excusing? O no, all is abusing. Your wisht sight if I desire, Suspitions you pretend; Causelesse you your selfe retire, While I in vaine attend. This a Lover whets, you say, Still made more eager by delay. Is this faire excusing? O no, all is abusing. When another holds your hand, You sweare I hold your hart: When my Rivals close doe stand And I sit farre apart, I am neerer yet then they, Hid in your bosome, as you say. Is this faire excusing? O no, all is abusing. Would my Rival then I were, Some els your secret friend: So much lesser should I feare, And not so much attend. They enjoy you, ev'ry one, Yet I must seeme your friend alone. Is this faire excusing? O no, all is abusing. XVII. [Come away, arm'd with loves delights] Come away, arm'd with loves delights, Thy sprightfull graces bring with thee: When loves longing fights, They must the sticklers be. Come quickly, come, the promis'd houre is wel-nye spent, And pleasure, being too much deferr'd, looseth her best content. Is shee come? O, how neare is shee? How farre yet from this friendly place? How many steps from me? When shall I her imbrace? These armes Ile spred, which onely at her sight shall close, Attending as the starry flowre that the Suns noone-tide knowes. XVIII. [Come, you pretty false-ey'd wanton] Come, you pretty false-ey'd wanton, Leave your crafty smiling: Thinke you to escape me now With slipp'ry words beguiling? No; you mock't me th'other day, When you got loose, you fled away; But, since I have caught you now, Ile clip your wings for flying: Smothring kisses fast Ile heape, And keepe you so from crying. Sooner may you count the starres, And number hayle downe pouring, Tell the Osiers of the Temmes, Or Goodwins Sands devouring, Then the thicke-showr'd kisses here Which now thy tyred lips must beare. Such a harvest never was, So rich and full of pleasure, But 'tis spent as soone as reapt, So trustlesse is loves treasure. Would it were dumb midnight now, When all the world lyes sleeping: Would this place some Desert were, Which no man hath in keeping. My desires should then be safe, And when you cry'd then would I laugh; But if ought might breed offence, Love onely should be blamed: I would live your servant still, And you my Saint unnamed. XIX. [A secret love or two, I must confesse] A secret love or two, I must confesse, I kindly welcome for change in close playing: Yet my deare husband I love ne'erthelesse, His desires, whole or halfe, quickly allaying, At all times ready to offer redresse. His owne he never wants, but hath it duely, Yet twits me, I keepe not touch with him truly. The more a spring is drawne, the more it flowes; No Lampe lesse light retaines by lighting others: Is hee a looser his losse that ne're knowes? Or is he wealthy that wast treasure smothers? My churle vowes no man shall sent his sweet Rose: His owne enough and more I give him duely, Yet still he twits mee, I keepe not touch truly. Wise Archers beare more then one shaft to field, The Venturer loads not with one ware his shipping: Should Warriers learne but one weapon to weilde? Or thrive faire plants ere the worse for the slipping? One dish cloyes, many fresh appetite yeeld: Mine owne Ile use, and his he shall have duely, Judge then what debter can keepe touch more truly. XX. [Her rosie cheekes, her ever smiling eyes] Her rosie cheekes, her ever smiling eyes, Are Spheares and beds where Love in triumph lies: Her rubine lips, when they their pearle unlocke, Make them seeme as they did rise All out of one smooth Currall Rocke. Oh, that of other Creatures store I knew More worthy, and more rare: For these are old, and shee so new, That her to them none should compare. Oh, could she love, would shee but heare a friend, Or that shee onely knew what sighs pretend. Her lookes inflame, yet cold as Ice is shee. Doe or speake, all's to one end, For what shee is, that will shee be. Yet will I never cease her prayse to sing, Though she gives no regard: For they that grace a worthlesse thing Are onely greedy of reward. [Songs of 2. Parts.] XXI. [Where shall I refuge seeke, if you refuse mee?] Where shall I refuge seeke, if you refuse mee? In you my hope, in you my fortune lyes; In you my life, though you unjust accuse me, My service scorne, and merit underprise. Oh bitter griefe, that exile is become Reward for faith, and pittie deafe and dumbe. Why should my firmnesse finde a seate so wav'ring? My simple vowes, my love you entertain'd, Without desert the same againe disfav'ring; Yet I my word and passion hold unstain'd. Oh wretched me, that my chiefe joy should breede My onely griefe, and kindnesse pitty neede. FINIS. Songs of Mourning: BEWAILING the untimely death of Prince Henry. Worded by THO. CAMPION. And set forth to bee sung with one voyce to the Lute, or Violl: By JOHN COPRARIO. 1613 AN ELEGIE upon the untimely death of Prince Henry. Reade, you that have some teares left yet unspent, Now weepe your selves hart sicke, and nere repent: For I will open to your free accesse The sanctuary of all heavinesse, Where men their fill may mourne, and never sinne: And I their humble Priest thus first beginne. Fly from the Skies, yee blessed beames of light; Rise up in horrid vapours, ugly night, And fetter'd bring that ravenous monster Fate, The fellon and the traytour to our state. Law-Eloquence wee neede not to convince His guilt; all know it, 'tis hee stole our Prince, The Prince of men, the Prince of all that bore Ever that princely name; O now no more Shall his perfections, like the Sunne-beames, dare The purblinde world: in heav'n those glories are. What could the greatest artist, Nature, adde T'encrease his graces? devine forme hee had, Striving in all his parts which should surpasse; And like a well tun'd chime his carriage was Full of coelestiall witchcraft, winning all To admiration and love personall. His Launce appear'd to the beholders eyes, When his faire hand advanc't it in the skyes, Larger then truth, for well could hee it wield, And make it promise honour in the field. When Court and Musicke cal'd him, off fell armes, And, as hee had beene shap't for loves alarmes, In harmony hee spake, and trod the ground In more proportion then the measur'd sound. How fit for peace was hee, and rosie beds! How fit to stand in troopes of iron heads, When time had with his circles made complete His charmed rounds! All things in time grow great. This feare, even like a commet that hangs high, And shootes his threatning flashes through the skye, Held all the eyes of Christendome intent Upon his youthfull hopes, casting th'event Of what was in his power, not in his will: For that was close conceal'd, and must lye still, As deepely hid as that designe which late With the French Lyon dyed. O earthly state, How doth thy greatnesse in a moment fall, And feastes in highest pompe turne funerall! But our young Henry, arm'd with all the arts That sute with Empire, and the gaine of harts, Bearing before him fortune, power, and love, Appear'd first in perfection, fit to move Fixt admiration; though his yeeres were greene, Their fruit was yet mature: his care had beene Survaying India, and implanting there The knowledge of that God which hee did feare: And ev'n now, though hee breathlesse lyes, his sayles Are strugling with the windes, for our avayles T'explore a passage hid from humane tract, Will fame him in the enterprise or fact. O Spirit full of hope, why art thou fled From deedes of honour? why's that vertue dead Which dwelt so well in thee? a bowre more sweet, If Paradise were found, it could not meete. Curst then bee Fate that stole our blessing so, And had for us now nothing left but woe, Had not th'All-seeing providence yet kept Another joy safe, that in silence slept: And that same Royall workeman, who could frame A Prince so worthy of immortall fame, Lives; and long may hee live, to forme the other His exprest image, and grace of his brother, To whose eternall peace wee offer now Guifts which hee lov'd, and fed: Musicks that flow Out of a sowre and melancholike vayne, Which best sort with the sorrowes wee sustaine. 1. TO THE MOST SACRED King James. O Griefe, how divers are thy shapes wherein men languish! The face sometime with teares thou fil'st, Sometime the hart thou kill'st With unseene anguish. Sometime thou smil'st to view how Fate Playes with our humane state: So farre from surety here Are all our earthly joyes, That what our strong hope buildes, when least wee feare, A stronger power destroyes. O Fate, why shouldst thou take from KINGS their joy and treasure? Their Image if men should deface, 'Twere death, which thou dost race Even at thy pleasure. Wisedome of holy Kings yet knowes Both what it hath, and owes. Heav'ns hostage, which you bredd And nurst with such choyce care, Is ravisht now, great KING, and from us ledd When wee were least aware. 2. TO THE MOST SACRED Queene Anne. Tis now dead night, and not a light on earth Or starre in heaven doth shine: Let now a mother mourne the noblest birth That ever was both mortall and divine. O sweetnesse peerelesse! more then humane grace! O flowry beauty! O untimely death! Now, Musicke, fill this place With thy most dolefull breath: O singing wayle a fate more truely funerall Then when with all his sonnes the sire of Troy did fall. Sleepe Joy, dye Mirth, and not a smile be seene, Or shew of harts content: For never sorrow neerer touch't a QUEENE, Nor were there ever teares more duely spent. O deare remembrance, full of ruefull woe! O ceacelesse passion! O unhumane hower! No pleasure now can grow, For wither'd is her flower. O anguish doe thy worst, and fury Tragicall, Since fate in taking one hath thus disorder'd all. 3. TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY Prince Charles. Fortune and Glory may be lost and woone, But when the worke of Nature is undone That losse flyes past returning; No helpe is left but mourning. What can to kinde youth more despightfull prove Then to be rob'd of one sole Brother? Father and Mother Aske reverence, a Brother onely love. Like age and birth, like thoughts and pleasures move: What gayne can he heape up, though showers of Crownes descend, Who for that good must change a brother and a friend? Follow, O follow yet thy Brothers fame, But not his fate: lets onely change the name, And finde his worth presented In thee, by him prevented. Or, past example of the dead, be great, Out of thy selfe begin thy storie: Vertue and glorie Are eminent, being plac't in princely seate. Oh, heaven, his age prolong with sacred heate, And on his honoured head let all the blessings light Which to his brothers life men wish't, and wisht them right. 4. TO THE MOST PRINCELY AND VERTUOUS the Lady Elizabeth. So parted you as if the world for ever Had lost with him her light: Now could your teares hard flint to ruth excite, Yet may you never Your loves againe partake in humane sight: O why should love such two kinde harts dissever As nature never knit more faire or firme together? So loved you as sister should a brother, Not in a common straine, For Princely blood doeth vulgar fire disdaine: But you each other On earth embrac't in a celestiall chaine. Alasse for love, that heav'nly borne affection To change should subject be, and suffer earths infection. 5. TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND MIGHTY Fredericke the fift, Count Palatine of the Rhein. How like a golden dreame you met and parted, That pleasing straight doth vanish: O, who can ever banish The thought of one so princely and free harted! But hee was pul'd up in his prime by fate, And love for him must mourne, though all too late. Teares to the dead are due, let none forbid Sad harts to sigh: true griefe cannot be hid. Yet the most bitter storme to height encreased By heav'n againe is ceased: O time, that all things movest, In griefe and joy thou equall measure lovest: Such the condition is of humane life, Care must with pleasure mixe, and peace with strife: Thoughts with the dayes must change; as tapers waste, So must our griefes; day breakes when night is past. 6. To the Most Disconsolate Great Brittaine. When pale famine fed on thee With her insatiate jawes; When civill broyles set murder free, Contemning all thy lawes; When heav'n, enrag'd, consum'd thee so With plagues, that none thy face could know, Yet in thy lookes affliction then shew'd lesse Then now for ones fall all thy parts expresse. Now thy highest States lament A sonne, and Brothers losse; Thy nobles mourne in discontent, And rue this fatall crosse; Thy Commons are with passion sad To thinke how brave a Prince they had: If all thy rockes from white to blacke should turne, Yet couldst thou not in shew more amply mourne. 7. To the World. O poore distracted world, partly a slave To Pagans sinnefull rage, partly obscur'd With ignorance of all the meanes that save; And ev'n those parts of thee that live assur'd Of heav'nly grace, Oh how they are devided With doubts late by a Kingly penne decided! O happy world, if what the Sire begunne Had beene clos'd up by his religious Sonne! Mourne all you soules opprest under the yoake Of Christian-hating Thrace: never appear'd More likelyhood to have that blacke league broke, For such a heavenly prince might well be fear'd Of earthly fiends. Oh, how is Zeale inflamed With power, when truth wanting defence is shamed! O princely soule, rest thou in peace, while wee In thine expect the hopes were ripe in thee. FINIS. THE THIRD AND FOURTH BOOKE OF AYRES: Composed BY Thomas Campian. So as they may be expressed by one Voyce, with a Violl, Lute, or Orpharion. THE THIRD BOOKE TO MY HONOURABLE FRIEND, Sr. THOMAS MOUNSON, KNIGHT AND BARONET. Since now those clouds, that lately over-cast Your Fame and Fortune, are disperst at last: And now since all to you fayre greetings make, Some out of love, and some for pitties sake: Shall I but with a common stile salute Your new enlargement? or stand onely mute? I, to whose trust and care you durst commit Your pined health, when Arte despayr'd of it? I, that in your affliction often view'd In you the fruits of manly fortitude, Patience, and even constancie of minde, That Rocke-like stood, and scorn'd both wave and winde? Should I, for all your ancient love to me, Endow'd with waighty favours, silent be? Your merits, and my gratitude, forbid That eyther should in Lethean Gulfe lye hid. But how shall I this worke of fame expresse? How can I better, after pensivenesse, Then with light straynes of Musicke, made to move Sweetly with the wide-spreading plumes of love? These youth-borne Ayres, then, prison'd in this Booke, Which in your Bowres much of their beeing tooke, Accept as a kinde offring from that hand Which, joyn'd with heart, your vertue may command. Who love a sure friend, as all good men doe, Since such you are, let those affect you to: And may the joyes of that Crowne never end, That innocence doth pitty, and defend. Yours devoted, THOMAS CAMPIAN. I. [Oft have I sigh'd for him that heares me not] Oft have I sigh'd for him that heares me not, Who absent hath both love and mee forgot. Oh yet I languish still through his delay: Dayes seeme as yeares, when wisht friends breake their day. Had hee but lov'd as common lovers use, His faithlesse stay some kindnesse would excuse: O yet I languish still, still constant mourne For him that can breake vowes, but not returne. II. [Now let her change and spare not] Now let her change and spare not; Since she proves strange I care not: Fain'd love charm'd so my delight That still I doted on her sight. But she is gone, new joies imbracing And my desires disgracing. When did I erre in blindnesse? Or vexe her with unkindnesse? If my cares serv'd her alone, Why is shee thus untimely gone? True love abides to th'houre of dying; False love is ever flying. False, then farewell for ever: Once false proves faithfull never. Hee that boasts now of thy love Shall soone my present fortunes prove: Were he as faire as bright Adonis, Faith is not had where none is. III. [Were my hart as some mens are, thy errours would not move me] Were my hart as some mens are, thy errours would not move me: But thy faults I curious finde, and speake because I love thee; Patience is a thing divine and farre, I grant, above mee. Foes sometimes befriend us more, our blacker deedes objecting, Then th'obsequious bosome guest, with false respect affecting: Friendship is the glasse of Truth, our hidden staines detecting. While I use of eyes enjoy, and inward light of reason, Thy observer will I be, and censor, but in season: Hidden mischiefe to conceale in State and Love is treason. IV. [Maydes are simple, some men say] Maydes are simple, some men say: They, forsooth, will trust no men. But, should they mens wils obey, Maides were very simple then. Truth a rare flower now is growne, Few men weare it in their hearts; Lovers are more easily knowne By their follies, then deserts. Safer may we credit give To a faithlesse wandring Jew Then a young mans vowes beleeve When he sweares his love is true. Love they make a poore blinde childe, But let none trust such as hee: Rather then to be beguil'd, Ever let me simple be. V. [So tyr'd are all my thoughts, that sence and spirits faile] So tyr'd are all my thoughts, that sence and spirits faile; Mourning I pine, and know not what I ayle. O what can yeeld ease to a minde, Joy in nothing that can finde? How are my powres fore-spoke? what strange distaste is this? Hence, cruell hate of that which sweetest is: Come, come delight, make my dull braine Feele once heate of joy againe. The lovers teares are sweet, their mover makes them so; Proud of a wound the bleeding Souldiers grow: Poore I alone, dreaming, endure Griefe that knowes nor cause, nor cure. And whence can all this grow? even from an idle minde, That no delight in any good can finde. Action alone makes the soule blest: Vertue dyes with too much rest. VI. [Why presumes thy pride on that, that must so private be] Why presumes thy pride on that, that must so private be Scarce that it can good be cal'd, though it seemes best to thee, Best of all that Nature fram'd, or curious eye can see? Tis thy beauty, foolish Maid, that like a blossome growes, Which who viewes no more enjoyes then on a bush a Rose; That by manies handling fades, and thou art one of those. If to one thou shalt prove true, and all beside reject, Then art thou but one mans good, which yeelds a poore effect; For the common'st good by farre deserves the best respect. But if for this goodnesse thou thy selfe wilt common make, Thou art then not good at all; so thou canst no way take But to prove the meanest good, or else all good forsake. Be not then of beauty proud, but so her colours beare That they prove not staines to her that them for grace should weare: So shalt thou to all more fayre then thou wert borne appeare. VII. [Kinde are her answeres] Kinde are her answeres, But her performance keeps no day, Breaks time, as dancers From their own Musicke when they stray: All her free favors And smooth words wing my hopes in vaine. O did ever voice so sweet but only fain? Can true love yeeld such delay, Converting joy to pain? Lost is our freedome When we submit to women so: Why doe wee neede them, When in their best they worke our woe? There is no wisedome Can alter ends by Fate prefixt: O why is the good of man with evill mixt? Never were dayes yet cal'd two, But one night went betwixt. VIII. [O griefe, O spight, to see poore Vertue scorn'd] O griefe, O spight, to see poore Vertue scorn'd, Truth far exil'd, False arte lov'd, Vice ador'd, Free Justice sold, worst causes best adorn'd, Right cast by Powre, Pittie in vaine implor'd! O who in such an age could wish to live, When none can have or hold, but such as give? O times! O men! to Nature rebels growne, Poore in desert, in name rich, proud of shame, Wise but in ill: your stiles are not your owne, Though dearely bought; honour is honest fame. Old Stories onely goodnesse now containe, And the true wisedome that is just, and plaine. IX. [O never to be moved] O never to be moved, O beauty unrelenting! Hard hart, too dearely loved; Fond love, too late repenting! Why did I dreame of too much blisse? Deceitfull hope was cause of this. O heare mee speake this, and no more: Live you in joy, while I my woes deplore. All comforts despayred Distaste your bitter scorning; Great sorrowes unrepayred Admit no meane in mourning: Dye, wretch, since hope from thee is fled; He that must dye is better dead. O deare delight, yet, ere I dye, Some pitty shew, though you reliefe deny. X. [Breake now my heart and dye! Oh no, she may relent.] Breake now my heart and dye! Oh no, she may relent. Let my despaire prevayle! Oh stay, hope is not spent. Should she now fixe one smile on thee, where were despaire? The losse is but easie which smiles can repayre. A stranger would please thee, if she were as fayre. Her must I love or none, so sweet none breathes as shee; The more is my despayre, alas, shee loves not mee: But cannot time make way for love through ribs of steele? The Grecian, inchanted all parts but the heele, At last a shaft daunted, which his hart did feele. XI. [If Love loves truth, then women doe not love] If Love loves truth, then women doe not love; Their passions all are but dissembled shewes; Now kinde and free of favour if they prove, Their kindnes straight a tempest overthrowes. Then as a Sea-man the poore lover fares: The storme drownes him ere hee can drowne his cares. But why accuse I women that deceive? Blame then the Foxes for their subtile wile: They first from Nature did their craft receive: It is a womans nature to beguile. Yet some, I grant, in loving stedfast grow; But such by use are made, not nature, so. O why had Nature power at once to frame Deceit and Beauty, traitors both to Love? O would Deceit had dyed when Beauty came With her divinesse ev'ry heart to move! Yet doe we rather wish, what ere befall, To have fayre women false, then none at all. XII. [Now winter nights enlarge] Now winter nights enlarge The number of their houres, And clouds their stormes discharge Upon the ayrie towres; Let now the chimneys blaze And cups o'erflow with wine, Let well-tun'd words amaze With harmonie divine. Now yellow waxen lights Shall waite on hunny Love, While youthfull Revels, Masks, and Courtly sights, Sleepes leaden spels remove. This time doth well dispence With lovers long discourse; Much speech hath some defence, Though beauty no remorse. All doe not all things well: Some measures comely tread, Some knotted Ridles tell, Some Poems smoothly read. The Summer hath his joyes, And Winter his delights; Though Love and all his pleasures are but toyes, They shorten tedious nights. XIII. [Awake, thou spring of speaking grace, mute rest becomes not thee] Awake, thou spring of speaking grace, mute rest becomes not thee; The fayrest women, while they sleepe, and Pictures equall bee. O come and dwell in loves discourses, Old renuing, new creating. The words which thy rich tongue discourses Are not of the common rating. Thy voyce is as an Eccho cleare which Musicke doth beget, Thy speech is as an Oracle which none can counterfeit: For thou alone, without offending, Hast obtain'd power of enchanting; And I could heare thee without ending, Other comfort never wanting. Some little reason brutish lives with humane glory share; But language is our proper grace, from which they sever'd are. As brutes in reason man surpasses, Men in speech excell each other: If speech be then the best of graces, Doe it not in slumber smother. XIV. [What is it that all men possesse, among themselves conversing?] What is it that all men possesse, among themselves conversing? Wealth or fame, or some such boast, scarce worthy the rehearsing? Women onely are mens good, with them in love conversing. If weary, they prepare us rest; if sicke, their hand attends us; When with griefe our hearts are prest, their comfort best befriends us: Sweet or sowre, they willing goe to share what fortune sends us. What pretty babes with paine they beare, our name and form presenting! What we get, how wise they keepe, by sparing, wants preventing; Sorting all their houshold cares to our observ'd contenting. All this, of whose large use I sing, in two words is expressed: Good wife is the good I praise, if by good men possessed; Bad with bad in ill sute well, but good with good live blessed. XV. [Fire that must flame is with apt fuell fed] Fire that must flame is with apt fuell fed, Flowers that wil thrive in sunny soyle are bred; How can a hart feele heate that no hope findes? Or can hee love on whom no comfort shines? Fayre, I confesse there's pleasure in your sight: Sweet, you have powre, I grant, of all delight: But what is all to mee, if I have none? Churle that you are, t'injoy such wealth alone. Prayers move the heav'ns, but finde no grace with you; Yet in your lookes a heavenly forme I view: Then will I pray againe, hoping to finde, As well as in your lookes, heav'n in your minde. Saint of my heart, Queene of my life, and love, O let my vowes thy loving spirit move: Let me no longer mourne through thy disdaine, But with one touch of grace cure all my paine. XVI. [If thou longst so much to learne (sweet boy) what 'tis to love] If thou longst so much to learne (sweet boy) what 'tis to love, Doe but fixe thy thought on mee, and thou shalt quickly prove. Little sute, at first, shal win Way to thy abasht desire, But then will I hedge thee in, Salamander-like, with fire. With thee dance I will, and sing, and thy fond dalliance beare; Wee the grovy hils will climbe, and play the wantons there; Other whiles wee'le gather flowres, Lying dalying on the grasse, And thus our delightfull howres Full of waking dreames shall passe. When thy joyes were thus at height, my love should turne from thee; Old acquaintance then should grow as strange as strange might be; Twenty rivals thou should'st finde Breaking all their hearts for mee, When to all Ile prove more kinde And more forward then to thee. Thus thy silly youth, enrag'd, would soone my love defie; But, alas, poore soule, too late: clipt wings can never flye. Those sweet houres which wee had past, Cal'd to minde, thy heart would burne; And, could'st thou flye ne'er so fast, They would make thee straight returne. XVII. [Shall I come, sweet Love, to thee] Shall I come, sweet Love, to thee, When the ev'ning beames are set? Shall I not excluded be? Will you finde no fained lett? Let me not, for pitty, more, Tell the long houres at your dore. Who can tell what theefe or foe, In the covert of the night, For his prey, will worke my woe, Or through wicked foule despight: So may I dye unredrest, Ere my long love be possest. But, to let such dangers passe, Which a lovers thoughts disdaine, 'Tis enough in such a place To attend loves joyes in vaine. Doe not mocke me in thy bed, While these cold nights freeze me dead. XVIII. [Thrice tosse these Oaken ashes in the ayre] Thrice tosse these Oaken ashes in the ayre, Thrice sit thou mute in this inchanted chayre; Then thrice three times tye up this true loves knot, And murmur soft, shee will, or shee will not. Goe burne these poys'nous weedes in yon blew fire, These Screech-owles fethers, and this prickling bryer, This Cypresse gathered at a dead mans grave: That all thy feares and cares an end may have. Then come, you Fayries, dance with me a round, Melt her hard hart with your melodious sound. In vaine are all the charmes I can devise: She hath an Arte to breake them with her eyes. XIX. [Be thou then my beauty named] Be thou then my beauty named, Since thy will is to be mine: For by that am I enflamed, Which on all alike doth shine. Others may the light admire, I onely truely feele the fire. But, if lofty titles move thee, Challenge then a Sov'raignes place: Say I honour when I love thee, Let me call thy kindnesse grace. State and Love things divers bee, Yet will we teach them to agree. Or, if this be not sufficing, Be thou stil'd my Goddesse then: I will love thee sacrificing, In thine honour Hymnes Ile pen. To be thine, what canst thou more? Ile love thee, serve thee, and adore. XX. [Fire, fire, fire, fire!] Fire, fire, fire, fire! Loe here I burne in such desire That all the teares that I can straine Out of mine idle empty braine Cannot allay my scorching paine. Come Trent, and Humber, and fayre Thames, Dread Ocean, haste with all thy streames: And, if you cannot quench my fire, O drowne both mee and my desire. Fire, fire, fire, fire! There is no hell to my desire: See, all the Rivers backward flye, And th'Ocean doth his waves deny, For feare my heate should drinke them dry. Come, heav'nly showres, then, pouring downe; Come, you that once the world did drowne: Some then you spar'd, but now save all, That else must burne, and with mee fall. XXI. [O sweet delight, O more then humane blisse] O sweet delight, O more then humane blisse, With her to live that ever loving is; To heare her speake, whose words so well are plac't, That she by them, as they in her are grac't; Those lookes to view, that feast the viewers eye; How blest is he that may so live and dye! Such love as this the golden times did know, When all did reape, yet none tooke care to sow: Such love as this an endlesse Summer makes, And all distaste from fraile affection takes. So lov'd, so blest, in my belov'd am I; Which, till their eyes ake, let yron men envy. XXII. [Thus I resolve, and time hath taught me so] Thus I resolve, and time hath taught me so: Since she is fayre and ever kinde to me, Though she be wilde and wanton-like in shew, Those little staines in youth I will not see. That she be constant, heav'n I oft implore; If pray'rs prevaile not, I can doe no more. Palme tree the more you presse, the more it growes: Leave it alone, it will not much exceede. Free beauty if you strive to yoke, you lose, And for affection strange distaste you breede. What Nature hath not taught, no Arte can frame: Wilde borne be wilde still, though by force made tame. XXIII. [Come, O come, my lifes delight] Come, O come, my lifes delight, Let me not in langour pine: Love loves no delay: thy sight, The more enjoy'd, the more divine. O come, and take from mee The paine of being depriv'd of thee. Thou all sweetnesse dost enclose, Like a little world of blisse: Beauty guards thy lookes: the Rose In them pure and eternall is. Come then, and make thy flight As swift to me as heav'nly light. XXIV. [Could my heart more tongues imploy] Could my heart more tongues imploy Then it harbors thoughts of griefe, It is now so farre from joy That it scarce could aske reliefe. Truest hearts by deedes unkinde To despayre are most enclin'd. Happy mindes, that can redeeme Their engagements how they please, That no joyes or hopes esteeme Halfe so pretious as their ease! Wisedome should prepare men so As if they did all foreknow. Yet no Arte or Caution can Growne affections easily change; Use is such a Lord of Man That he brookes worst what is strange. Better never to be blest Then to loose all at the best. XXV. [Sleepe, angry beauty, sleep, and feare not me] Sleepe, angry beauty, sleep, and feare not me, For who a sleeping Lyon dares provoke? It shall suffice me here to sit and see Those lips shut up that never kindely spoke. What sight can more content a lovers minde Then beauty seeming harmlesse, if not kinde? My words have charm'd her, for secure shee sleepes, Though guilty much of wrong done to my love; And in her slumber, see! shee close-ey'd weepes! Dreames often more then waking passions move. Pleade, sleepe, my cause, and make her soft like thee, That shee in peace may wake and pitty mee. XXVI. [Silly boy, 'tis ful Moone yet, thy night as day shines clearely] Silly boy, 'tis ful Moone yet, thy night as day shines clearely; Had thy youth but wit to feare, thou couldst not love so dearely. Shortly wilt thou mourne when all thy pleasures are bereaved; Little knowes he how to love that never was deceived. This is thy first mayden flame, that triumphes yet unstayned; All is artlesse now you speake, not one word yet is fayned; All is heav'n that you behold, and all your thoughts are blessed: But no Spring can want his Fall, each Troylus hath his Cresseid. Thy well-order'd lockes ere long shall rudely hang neglected; And thy lively pleasant cheare reade griefe on earth dejected. Much then wilt thou blame thy Saint, that made thy heart so holy, And with sighs confesse, in love, that too much faith is folly. Yet, be just and constant still; Love may beget a wonder, Not unlike a Summers frost, or Winters fatall thunder: Hee that holds his Sweet-hart true unto his day of dying Lives, of all that ever breath'd, most worthy the envying. XXVII. [Never love unlesse you can] Never love unlesse you can Beare with all the faults of man: Men sometimes will jealous bee Though but little cause they see, And hang the head, as discontent, And speake what straight they will repent. Men that but one Saint adore Make a shew of love to more: Beauty must be scorn'd in none, Though but truely serv'd in one: For what is courtship, but disguise? True hearts may have dissembling eyes. Men, when their affaires require, Must a while themselves retire: Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawke, And not ever sit and talke. If these, and such like, you can beare, Then like, and love, and never feare. XXVIII. [So quicke, so hot, so mad is thy fond sute] So quicke, so hot, so mad is thy fond sute, So rude, so tedious growne, in urging mee, That faine I would with losse make thy tongue mute, And yeeld some little grace to quiet thee: An houre with thee I care not to converse, For I would not be counted too perverse. But roofes too hot would prove for men all fire, And hils too high for my unused pace; The grove is charg'd with thornes and the bold bryer; Gray Snakes the meadowes shrowde in every place: A yellow Frog, alas, will fright me so, As I should start and tremble as I goe. Since then I can on earth no fit roome finde, In heaven I am resolv'd with you to meete; Till then, for Hopes sweet sake, rest your tir'd minde, And not so much as see mee in the streete: A heavenly meeting one day wee shall have, But never, as you dreame, in bed, or grave. XXIX. [Shall I then hope when faith is fled?] Shall I then hope when faith is fled? Can I seeke love when hope is gone? Or can I live when Love is dead? Poorely hee lives, that can love none. Her vowes are broke, and I am free; Shee lost her faith in loosing mee. When I compare mine owne events, When I weigh others like annoy, All doe but heape up discontents That on a beauty build their joy. Thus I of all complaine, since shee All faith hath lost in loosing mee. So my deare freedome have I gain'd Through her unkindnesse and disgrace; Yet could I ever live enchain'd, As shee my service did embrace. But shee is chang'd, and I am free: Faith failing her, Love dyed in mee. THE FOURTH BOOKE TO MY WORTHY FRIEND, Mr. JOHN MOUNSON, Sonne and Heyre to Sir Thomas Mounson, Knight and Baronet. On you th'affections of your Fathers Friends, With his Inheritance by right descends; But you your gracefull youth so wisely guide, That his you hold, and purchase much beside. Love is the fruit of Vertue, for whose sake Men onely liking each to other take. If sparkes of vertue shin'd not in you then, So well how could you winne the hearts of men? And, since that honour and well-suted Prayse Is Vertues Golden Spurre, let mee now rayse Unto an act mature your tender age, This halfe commending to your Patronage: Which from your Noble Fathers, but one side, Ordain'd to doe you honour, doth divide. And so my love betwixt you both I part, On each side placing you as neare my heart. Yours ever, THOMAS CAMPIAN. I. [Leave prolonging thy distresse] Leave prolonging thy distresse: All delayes afflict the dying. Many lost sighes long I spent, to her for mercy crying; But now, vaine mourning, cease: Ile dye, and mine owne griefes release. Thus departing from this light To those shades that end all sorrow, Yet a small time of complaint, a little breath Ile borrow, To tell my once delight I dye alone through her despight. II. [Respect my faith, regard my service past] Respect my faith, regard my service past; The hope you wing'd call home to you at last. Great prise it is that I in you shall gaine, So great for you hath been my losse and paine. My wits I spent and time for you alone, Observing you and loosing all for one. Some rais'd to rich estates in this time are, That held their hopes to mine inferiour farre: Such scoffing mee, or pittying me, say thus, Had hee not lov'd, he might have liv'd like us. O then, deare sweet, for love and pitties sake, My faith reward, and from me scandall take. III. [Thou joy'st, fond boy, to be by many loved] Thou joy'st, fond boy, to be by many loved, To have thy beauty of most dames approved. For this dost thou thy native worth disguise And play'st the Sycophant t'observe their eyes. Thy glasse thou councel'st more t'adorne thy skin, That first should schoole thee to be fayre within. 'Tis childish to be caught with Pearle, or Amber, And woman-like too much to cloy the chamber; Youths should the Field affect, heate their rough Steedes, Their hardned nerves to fit for better deedes. Is't not more joy strong Holds to force with swords, Then womens weakenesse take with lookes or words? Men that doe noble things all purchase glory: One man for one brave Act hath prov'd a story: But if that one tenne thousand Dames o'ercame, Who would record it, if not to his shame? 'Tis farre more conquest with one to live true Then every houre to triumph Lord of new. IV. [Vaile, love, mine eyes, O hide from me] Vaile, love, mine eyes, O hide from me The plagues that charge the curious minde: If beauty private will not be, Suffice it yet that she proves kinde. Who can usurp heav'ns light alone? Stars were not made to shine on one. Griefes past recure fooles try to heale, That greater harmes on lesse inflict; The pure offend by too much zeale, Affection should not be too strict. Hee that a true embrace will finde To beauties faults must still be blinde. V. [Ev'ry Dame affects good fame, what ere her doings be] Ev'ry Dame affects good fame, what ere her doings be, But true prayse is Vertues Bayes, which none may weare but she. Borrow'd guise fits not the wise, a simple look is best; Native grace becomes a face, though ne'er so rudely drest. Now such new found toyes are sold, these women to disguise, That, before the yeare growes old, the newest fashion dyes. Dames of yore contended more in goodnesse to exceede Then in pride to be envi'd for that which least they neede: Little Lawne then serv'd the Pawne, if Pawne at all there were; Home-spun thread, and houshold bread, then held out all the yeare. But th'attyres of women now weare out both house and land; That the wives in silkes may flow, at ebbe the Good-men stand. Once agen, Astraea, then, from heav'n to earth descend, And vouchsafe in their behalfe these errours to amend: Aid from heav'n must make all eev'n, things are so out of frame, For let man strive all he can, hee needes must please his Dame. Happy man, content that gives, and what hee gives enjoyes; Happy Dame, content that lives, and breakes no sleepe for toyes. VI. [So sweet is thy discourse to me] So sweet is thy discourse to me, And so delightfull is thy sight, As I taste nothing right but thee. O why invented Nature light? Was it alone for beauties sake, That her grac't words might better take? No more can I old joyes recall: They now to me become unknowne, Not seeming to have beene at all. Alas, how soone is this love growne To such a spreading height in me As with it all must shadowed be! VII. [There is a Garden in her face] There is a Garden in her face, Where Roses and white Lillies grow; A heav'nly paradice is that place, Wherein all pleasant fruits doe flow. There Cherries grow, which none may buy Till Cherry ripe themselves doe cry. Those Cherries fayrely doe enclose Of Orient Pearle a double row, Which when her lovely laughter showes, They looke like Rose-buds fill'd with snow. Yet them nor Peere nor Prince can buy, Till Cherry ripe themselves doe cry. Her Eyes like Angels watch them still; Her Browes like bended bowes doe stand, Threatning with piercing frownes to kill All that attempt with eye or hand Those sacred Cherries to come nigh, Till Cherry ripe themselves doe cry. VIII. [To his sweet Lute Apollo sung the motions of the Spheares] To his sweet Lute Apollo sung the motions of the Spheares, The wondrous order of the Stars, whose course divides the yeares, And all the Mysteries above: But none of this could Midas move, Which purchast him his Asses eares. Then Pan with his rude Pipe began the Country-wealth t'advance, To boast of Cattle, flockes of Sheepe, and Goates on hils that dance, With much more of this churlish kinde: That quite transported Midas minde, And held him rapt as in a trance. This wrong the God of Musicke scorn'd from such a sottish Judge, And bent his angry bow at Pan, which made the Piper trudge: Then Midas head he so did trim That ev'ry age yet talkes of him And Phoebus right revenged grudge. IX. [Young and simple though I am] Young and simple though I am, I have heard of Cupids name: Guesse I can what thing it is Men desire when they doe kisse. Smoake can never burne, they say, But the flames that follow may. I am not so foule or fayre To be proud, nor to despayre; Yet my lips have oft observ'd, Men that kisse them presse them hard, As glad lovers use to doe When their new met loves they wooe. Faith, 'tis but a foolish minde, Yet, me thinkes, a heate I finde, Like thirst longing, that doth bide Ever on my weaker side, Where they say my heart doth move. Venus, grant it be not love. If it be, alas, what then? Were not women made for men? As good 'twere a thing were past, That must needes be done at last. Roses that are over-blowne Growe lesse sweet, then fall alone. Yet nor Churle, nor silken Gull Shall my Mayden blossome pull: Who shall not I soone can tell; Who shall, would I could as well: This I know, who ere hee be, Love hee must, or flatter me. X. [Love me or not, love her I must or dye] Love me or not, love her I must or dye; Leave me or not, follow her needs must I. O, that her grace would my wisht comforts give: How rich in her, how happy should I live! All my desire, all my delight should be Her to enjoy, her to unite to mee: Envy should cease, her would I love alone: Who loves by lookes, is seldome true to one. Could I enchant, and that it lawfull were, Her would I charme softly that none should heare. But love enforc'd rarely yeelds firme content; So would I love that neyther should repent. XI. [What meanes this folly, now to brave it so] What meanes this folly, now to brave it so, And then to use submission? Is that a friend that straight can play the foe? Who loves on such condition? Though Bryers breede Roses, none the Bryer affect, But with the flowre are pleased. Love onely loves delight and soft respect: He must not be diseased. These thorny passions spring from barren breasts, Or such as neede much weeding. Love onely loves delight and soft respect; But sends them not home bleeding. Command thy humour, strive to give content, And shame not loves profession. Of kindnesse never any could repent That made choyse with discretion. XII. [Deare, if I with guile would guild a true intent] Deare, if I with guile would guild a true intent, Heaping flattries that in heart were never meant, Easely could I then obtaine What now in vaine I force; Fals-hood much doth gaine, Truth yet holds the better course. Love forbid that through dissembling I should thrive, Or, in praysing you, my selfe of truth deprive: Let not your high thoughts debase A simple truth in me; Great is beauties grace, Truth is yet as fayre as shee. Prayse is but the winde of pride, if it exceedes; Wealth, pris'd in it selfe, no outward value needes. Fayre you are, and passing fayre; You know it, and 'tis true: Yet let none despayre But to finde as fayre as you. XIII. [O Love, where are thy Shafts, thy Quiver, and thy Bow?] O Love, where are thy Shafts, thy Quiver, and thy Bow? Shall my wounds onely weepe, and hee ungaged goe? Be just, and strike him, to, that dares contemne thee so. No eyes are like to thine, though men suppose thee blinde, So fayre they levell when the marke they list to finde: Then strike, o strike the heart that beares the cruell minde. Is my fond sight deceived? or doe I Cupid spye Close ayming at his breast, by whom despis'd I dye? Shoot home, sweet Love, and wound him, that hee may not flye! O then we both will sit in some unhaunted shade, And heale each others wound which Love hath justly made: O hope, o thought too vaine, how quickly dost thou fade! At large he wanders still, his heart is free from paine, While secret sighes I spend, and teares, but all in vaine: Yet, Love, thou know'st, by right I should not thus complaine. XIV. [Beauty is but a painted hell] Beauty is but a painted hell: Aye me, aye me, Shee wounds them that admire it, Shee kils them that desire it. Give her pride but fuell, No fire is more cruell. Pittie from ev'ry heart is fled, Aye me, aye me; Since false desire could borrow Teares of dissembled sorrow, Constant vowes turne truthlesse, Love cruell, Beauty ruthlesse. Sorrow can laugh, and Fury sing, Aye me, aye me; My raving griefes discover I liv'd too true a lover: The first step to madnesse Is the excesse of sadnesse. XV. [Are you what your faire lookes expresse?] Are you what your faire lookes expresse? Oh then be kinde: From law of Nature they digresse Whose forme sutes not their minde: Fairenesse seene in th'outward shape Is but th'inward beauties Ape. Eyes that of earth are mortall made, What can they view? All's but a colour or a shade, And neyther alwayes true. Reasons sight, that is eterne, Ev'n the substance can discerne. Soule is the Man; for who will so The body name? And to that power all grace we owe That deckes our living frame. What, or how, had housen bin, But for them that dwell therein? Love in the bosome is begot, Not in the eyes; No beauty makes the eye more hot, Her flames the spright surprise: Let our loving mindes then meete, For pure meetings are most sweet. XVI. [Since she, ev'n shee, for whom I liv'd] Since she, ev'n shee, for whom I liv'd, Sweet she by Fate from me is torne, Why am not I of sence depriv'd, Forgetting I was ever borne? Why should I languish, hating light? Better to sleepe an endlesse night. Be 't eyther true, or aptly fain'd, That some of Lethes water write, 'Tis their best med'cine that are pain'd All thought to loose of past delight. O would my anguish vanish so! Happy are they that neyther know. XVII. [I must complain, yet doe enjoy my Love] I must complain, yet doe enjoy my Love; She is too faire, too rich in lovely parts: Thence is my grief, for Nature, while she strove With all her graces and divinest Arts To form her too too beautifull of hue, Shee had no leasure left to make her true. Should I, agriev'd, then wish shee were lesse fayre? That were repugnant to mine owne desires: Shee is admir'd, new lovers still repayre; That kindles daily loves forgetfull fires. Rest, jealous thoughts, and thus resolve at last: Shee hath more beauty then becomes the chast. XVIII. [Think'st thou to seduce me then with words that have no meaning?] Think'st thou to seduce me then with words that have no meaning? Parats so can learne to prate, our speech by pieces gleaning: Nurces teach their children so about the time of weaning. Learne to speake first, then to wooe: to wooing much pertayneth: Hee that courts us, wanting Arte, soone falters when he fayneth, Lookes a-squint on his discourse, and smiles when hee complaineth. Skilfull Anglers hide their hookes, fit baytes for every season; But with crooked pins fish thou, as babes doe that want reason; Gogians onely can be caught with such poore trickes of treason. Ruth forgive me, if I err'd from humane hearts compassion When I laught sometimes too much to see thy foolish fashion: But, alas, who lesse could doe that found so good occasion? XIX. [Her fayre inflaming eyes] Her fayre inflaming eyes, Chiefe authors of my cares, I prai'd in humblest wise With grace to view my teares: They beheld me broad awake, But, alasse, no ruth would take. Her lips with kisses rich, And words of fayre delight, I fayrely did beseech To pitty my sad plight: But a voyce from them brake forth As a whirle-winde from the North. Then to her hands I fled, That can give heart and all; To them I long did plead, And loud for pitty call: But, alas, they put mee off With a touch worse then a scoffe. So backe I straight return'd, And at her breast I knock'd; Where long in vaine I mourn'd, Her heart so fast was lock'd: Not a word could passage finde, For a Rocke inclos'd her minde. Then downe my pray'rs made way To those most comely parts That make her flye or stay, As they affect deserts: But her angry feete, thus mov'd, Fled with all the parts I lov'd. Yet fled they not so fast As her enraged minde: Still did I after haste, Still was I left behinde, Till I found 'twas to no end With a Spirit to contend. XX. [Turne all thy thoughts to eyes] Turne all thy thoughts to eyes, Turne all thy haires to eares, Change all thy friends to spies, And all thy joyes to feares: True Love will yet be free, In spite of Jealousie. Turne darknesse into day, Conjectures into truth, Beleeve what th'envious say, Let age interpret youth: True love will yet be free, In spite of Jealousie. Wrest every word and looke, Racke ev'ry hidden thought, Or fish with golden hooke, True love cannot be caught: For that will still be free, In spite of Jealousie. XXI. [If any hath the heart to kill] If any hath the heart to kill, Come rid me of this wofull paine. For while I live I suffer still This cruell torment all in vaine: Yet none alive but one can guesse What is the cause of my distresse. Thanks be to heav'n, no grievous smart, No maladies my limbes annoy; I beare a sound and sprightfull heart, Yet live I quite depriv'd of joy: Since what I had, in vaine I crave, And what I had not, now I have. A Love I had, so fayre, so sweet, As ever wanton eye did see. Once by appointment wee did meete; Shee would, but ah, it would not be: She gave her heart, her hand shee gave; All did I give, shee nought could have. What Hagge did then my powers forespeake, That never yet such taint did feele? Now shee rejects me as one weake, Yet am I all compos'd of steele. Ah, this is it my heart doth grieve: Now though shee sees, shee'le not believe! XXII. [Beauty, since you so much desire] Beauty, since you so much desire To know the place of Cupids fire: About you somewhere doth it rest, Yet never harbour'd in your brest, Nor gout-like in your heele or toe; What foole would seeke Loves flame so low? But a little higher, but a little higher, There, there, o there lyes Cupids fire. Thinke not, when Cupid most you scorne, Men judge that you of Ice were borne; For, though you cast love at your heele, His fury yet sometime you feele; And where-abouts if you would know, I tell you still, not in your toe: But a little higher, but a little higher, There, there, o there lyes Cupids fire. XXIII. [Your faire lookes urge my desire] Your faire lookes urge my desire: Calme it, sweet, with love. Stay, o why will you retire? Can you churlish prove? If Love may perswade, Loves pleasures, deare, deny not: Here is a grove secur'd with shade; O then be wise, and flye not. Harke, the Birds delighted sing, Yet our pleasure sleepes. Wealth to none can profit bring, Which the miser keepes: O come, while we may, Let's chayne Love with embraces; Wee have not all times time to stay, Nor safety in all places. What ill finde you now in this? Or who can complaine? There is nothing done amisse, That breedes no man payne. 'Tis now flowry May, But ev'n in cold December, When all these leaves are blowne away, This place shall I remember. XXIV. [Faine would I wed a faire yong man that day and night could please mee] Faine would I wed a faire yong man that day and night could please mee, When my mind or body grieved, that had the powre to ease mee. Maids are full of longing thoughts that breed a bloudlesse sickenesse, And that, oft I heare men say, is onely cur'd by quicknesse. Oft have I beene woo'd and prai'd, but never could be moved: Many for a day or so I have most dearely loved, But this foolish mind of mine straight loaths the thing resolved. If to love be sinne in mee, that sinne is soone absolved. Sure, I thinke I shall at last flye to some holy Order; When I once am setled there, then can I flye no farther. Yet I would not dye a maid, because I had a mother: As I was by one brought forth, I would bring forth another. FINIS. OCCASIONAL POEMS In honour of the Author by Tho: Campion Doctor in Physicke.

Prefixed to Ayres (1609) by Alfonso Ferrabosco the Younger (ca. 1580–1628). Musicks maister, and the offspring Of rich Musicks Father, Old Alfonso's Image living, These faire flowers you gather Scatter through the Brittish soile; Give thy fame free wing, And gaine the merit of thy toyle: Wee, whose loves affect to praise thee, Beyond thine owne deserts can never raise thee. By T. Campion, Doctor in Physicke. Of this Ensuing Discourse. Prefixed to A Briefe Discourse of the true (but neglected) use of Charact'ring the Degrees by their Perfection, Imperfection, and Diminution in Measurable Musicke, against the Common Practise and Custome of these Times, published in 1614 by Thomas Ravenscroft (ca. 1582–1635) Markes that did limit Lands in former times None durst remove; so much the common good Prevail'd with all men; 'twas the worst of crimes. The like in Musicke may be understood, For That the treasure of the Soule is, next To the rich Store-house of Divinity: Both comfort Soules that are with care perplext, And set the Spirit Both from passions free. The Markes that limit Musicke heere are taught, So fixt of ould, which none by right can change, Though Use much alteration hath wrought, To Musickes Fathers that would now seeme strange. The best embrace, which herein you may finde, And th'Author praise for his good Worke and Minde. THO: CAMPION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Poems and Songs from the Masques] To the most puisant and Gratious James King of great Britaine. The disunited Scithians, when they sought To gather strength by parties, and combine That perfect league of freends which, once beeing wrought, No turne of time or fortune could untwine, This rite they held: a massie bowle was brought, And ev'ry right arme shot his severall blood Into the mazar till 'twas fully fraught. Then having stird it to an equall floud They quaft to th'union, which till death should last, In spite of private foe, or forraine feare; And this blood sacrament being knowne t'have past, Their names grew dreadfull to all far and neere. O then, great Monarch, with how wise a care Do you these bloods devided mixe in one, And with like consanguinities prepare The high, and everliving Union Tweene Scots and English: who can wonder then If he that marries kingdomes, marries men? An Epigram. Merlin, the great King Arthur being slaine, Foretould that he should come to life againe, And long time after weild great Brittaines state More powerfull ten-fould, and more fortunate. Prophet, 'tis true, and well we find the same, Save onely that thou didst mistake the name. To the Right Noble and Vertuous Theophilus Howard, Lorde of Walden, sonne and Heire to the right Honorable the Earle of Suffolke. If to be sprong of high and princely blood, If to inherite vertue, honour, grace, If to be great in all things, and yet good, If to be facill, yet t'have power and place, If to be just and bountifull, may get The love of men, your right may chalenge it. The course of forraine manners far and wide, The courts, the countries, Citties, townes and state, The blossome of your springing youth hath tried, Honourd in ev'ry place and fortunate, Which now grown fairer doth adorne our Court With princelie revelling, and timely sport. But if th'admired vertues of your youth Breede such despairing to my daunted muse, That it can scarcely utter naked truth, How shall it mount, as ravisht spirits use, Under the burden of your riper dayes, Or hope to reach the so far distant bayes? My slender Muse shall yet my love expresse, And by the faire Thames side of you sheele sing; The double streames shall beare her willing verse Far hence with murmur of their ebbe and spring. But if you favour her light tunes, ere long Sheele strive to raise you with a loftier song. To the Right Vertuous, and Honorable, the Lord and Lady HAYES. Should I presume to separate you now, That were so lately joyn'de by holy vow, For whome this golden dreame which I report Begot so many waking eyes at Court, And for whose grace so many nobles chang'd Their names and habites, from themselves estrang'd? Accept together, and together view This little worke which all belongs to you, And live together many blessed dayes, To propagate the honour'd name of HAYES. Song [Now hath Flora rob'd her bowers] Now hath Flora rob'd her bowers To befrend this place with flowers; Strowe aboute, strowe aboute, The Skye rayn'd never kindlyer Showers. Flowers with Bridalls well agree, Fresh as Brides, and Bridgromes be: Strowe aboute, strowe aboute, And mixe them with fit melodie. Earth hath no Princelier flowers Then Roses white, and Roses red, But they must still be mingled. And as a Rose new pluckt from Venus thorne, So doth a Bride her Bride-groomes bed adorne. Divers divers Flowers affect For some private deare respect; Strowe about, strowe about, Let every one his owne protect. But hees none of Floras friend That will not the Rose commend. Strow about, strow about, Let Princes Princely flowers defend. Roses, the Gardens pride, Are flowers for love and flowers for Kinges, In courts desir'd and Weddings. And as a Rose in Venus bosome worne, So doth a Bridegroome his Brides bed adorne. The song in forme of a Diaglogue. CAN. Who is the happier of the two, A maide, or wife? TEN. Which is more to be desired. Peace or strife? CAN. What strife can be where two are one, Or what delight to pine alone? BAS. None such true freendes, none so sweet life, As that betweene the man and wife. TEN. A maide is free, a wife is tyed. CAN. No maide but faine would be a Bride. TEN. Why live so many single then? Tis not, I hope, for want of men. CAN. The bow and arrow both may fit, And yet tis hard the marke to hit. BAS. He levels faire that by his side Laies at night his lovely Bride. CHO. Sing Io, Hymen: Io, Io, Hymen. Song. [Move now with measured sound] Move now with measured sound, You charmed grove of gould, Trace forth the sacred ground That shall your formes unfold. To the Reader. Neither buskin now, nor bayes Challenge I: a Ladies prayse Shall content my proudest hope. Their applause was all my scope, And to their shrines properly Revels dedicated be: Whose soft eares none ought to pierce But with smooth and gentle verse. Let the tragicke Poeme swell, Raysing raging feendes from hell; And let Epicke Dactils range Swelling seas and Countries strange: Little roome small things containes; Easy prayse quites easy paines. Suffer them whose browes do sweat To gaine honour by the great: Its enough if men me name A Retailer of such fame. A Song and Dance of sixe, two Keepers, two Robinhood-men, the fantastick Traveller, and the Cynick. 1 Dance now and sing the joy and love we owe: Let chearfull voices and glad gestures showe, The Queene of grace is shee whom we receive; Honour and State are her guides, Her presence they can never leave. Then in a stately Silvan forme salute Her ever flowing grace. Fill all the Woods with Ecchoed welcomes, And strew with flowers this place: Let ev'ry bow and plant fresh blossomes yeeld, And all the aire refine. Let pleasure strive to please our Goddesse, For shee is all divine. 2 Yet once againe, let us our measures move, And with sweet notes record our joyfull love. An object more divine none ever had. Beautie, and heav'n-borne worth, Mixt in perfection never fade. Then with a dance triumphant let us sing Her high advanced praise, And ev'n to heav'n our gladsome welcomes With wings of musick raise; Welcome, O welcome, ever-honoured Queene, To this now-blessed place, That grove, that bowre, that house is happy Which you vouchsafe to grace. A Song of a treble and base, sung by the Gardiners boy and man, to musicke of Instruments, that was readie to second them in the Arbour. 1 Welcome to this flowrie place, Faire Goddesse and sole Queene of grace: All eyes triumph in your sight, Which through all this emptie space Casts such glorious beames of light. 2 Paradise were meeter farre To entertaine so bright a Starre: But why erres my folly so? Paradise is where you are: Heav'n above, and heav'n below. 3 Could our powers and wishes meete, How well would they your graces greete. Yet accept of our desire: Roses, of all flowers most sweete, Spring out of the silly brier. [O Joyes exceeding!] 1 O Joyes exceeding! From love, from power of your wisht sight proceeding! As a faire morne shines divinely, Such is your view, appearing more divinely. 2 Your steppes ascending, Raise high our thoughts for your content contending; All our hearts of this grace vaunting, Now leape as they were moved by inchaunting. A Song of three Voyces with divers Instruments. 1 Night as well as brightest day hath her delight. Let us then with mirth and Musicke decke the night; Never did glad day such store Of joy to night bequeath: Her Starres then adore, Both in Heav'n and here beneath. 2 Love and beautie, mirth and Musicke, yeeld true joyes, Though the Cynickes in their folly count them toyes. Raise your spirits nere so high, They will be apt to fall: None brave thoughts envie, Who had ere brave thought at all. 3 Joy is the sweete friend of life, the nurse of blood, Patron of all health, and fountaine of all good: Never may joy hence depart, But all your thoughts attend; Nought can hurt the heart That retaines so sweete a friend. A Song of three voices continuing while the presents are delivered and received. 1 Can you, the Author of our joy, So soone depart? Will you revive, and straight destroy, New mirth to teares convert? O that ever cause of gladnesse Should so swiftly turne to sadnesse! 2 Now as we droupe, so will these flowers, Bard of your sight, Nothing availe them heav'nly showres Without your heav'nly light. When the glorious Sunne forsakes us, Winter quickly over-takes us. 3 Yet shall our praiers your waies attend, When you are gone; And we the tedious time will spend, Remembring you alone. Welcome here shall you heare ever, But the word of parting never. A Song. [Come away; bring thy golden theft] 1 Come away; bring thy golden theft, Bring, bright Prometheus, all thy lights; Thy fires from Heav'n bereft Shew now to humane sights. Come quickly, come: thy stars to our stars straight present, For pleasure, being too much defer'd, loseth her best content. What fair dames wish should swift as their own thoughts appeare; To loving and to longing harts every houre seemes a yeare. 2 See how faire: O how faire they shine; What yeelds more pompe beneath the skies? Their birth is yet divine, And such their forme implies. Large grow their beames, their nere approch afford them so; By nature sights that pleasing are, cannot too amply show. O might these flames in humane shapes descend this place, How lovely would their presence be, how full of grace! A Song. [Advance your Chorall motions now] 1 Advance your Chorall motions now, You musick-loving lights; This night concludes the nuptiall vow, Make this the best of nights: So bravely Crowne it with your beames, That it may live in fame, As long as Rhenus or the Thames Are knowne by either name. 2 Once move againe, yet nearer move Your formes at willing view; Such faire effects of joy and love None can expresse but you: Then revell midst your ayrie Bowres Till all the clouds doe sweat, That pleasure may be powr'd in showres On this triumphant Seat. 3 Long since hath lovely Flora throwne Her Flowers and Garlands here; Rich Ceres all her wealth hath showne, Prowde of her daintie cheare. Chang'd then to humane shape, descend, Clad in familiar weede, That every eye may here commend The kinde delights you breede. A full Song. Supported now by Clouds descend, Divine Prometheus, Hymens friend: Leade downe the new transformed fires, And fill their breasts with loves desires; That they may revell with delight, And celebrate this nuptiall night, So celebrate this nuptiall night, That all which see may stay: They never viewed so faire a sight, Even on the cleerest day. The Song. [Wooe her, and win her, he that can] 1 Wooe her, and win her, he that can: Each woman hath two lovers, So shee must take and leave a man, Till time more grace discovers; This doth Jove to shew that want Makes beautie most respected; If faire women were more skant, They would be more affected. 2 Courtship and Musicke suite with love, They both are workes of passion; Happie is he whose words can move, Yet sweete notes helpe perswasion. Mixe your words with Musicke then, That they the more may enter; Bold assaults are fit for men, That on strange beauties venture. The second Invocation to the tune of the first. Powerfull Jove, that hast given fower, Raise this number but once more, That, complete, their numerous feet May aptly in just measures meet. [Breath you now, while Io Hymen] Breath you now, while Io Hymen To the Bride we sing: O how many joyes, and honors, From this match will spring! Ever firme the league will prove, Where only goodnesse causeth love. Some for profit seeke What their fancies most disleeke: These love for vertues sake alone: Beautie and youth unite them both in one. CHORUS. Live with thy Bridegroome happy, sacred Bride; How blest is he that is for love envi'd. The Maskers second dance. Breath againe, while we with musicke Fill the emptie space: O but do not in your dances Your selves only grace. Ev'ry one fetch out your Pheare, Whom chiefely you will honor heere. Sights most pleasure breed, When their numbers most exceed: Chuse then, for choice to all is free; Taken or left, none discontent must bee. A Song. [Cease, cease you Revels, rest a space] Cease, cease you Revels, rest a space; New pleasures presse into this place, Full of beautie and of grace. A SONG. [Come triumphing, come with state] Come triumphing, come with state, Old Sibilla, reverend Dame; Thou keep'st the secret key of fate, Preventing swiftest fame. This night breath onely words of joy, And speake them plaine, now be not coy. A Song and dance triumphant of the Maskers. 1 Dance, dance, and visit now the shadowes of our joy, All in height, and pleasing state, your changed formes imploy. And as the bird of Jove salutes, with loftie wing, the morn, So mount, so flie, these Trophees to adorne. Grace them with all the sounds and motions of delight, Since all the earth cannot expresse a lovelier sight. View them with triumph, and in shades the truth adore: No pompe or sacrifice can please Ioves greatnesse more. 2 Turne, turne, and honor now the life these figures beare; Loe, how heav'nly natures farre above all art appeare; Let their aspects revive in you the fire that shin'd so late, Still mount and still retaine your heavenly state. Gods were with dance, and with musick serv'd of old, Those happy daies deriv'd their glorious stile from gold: This pair, by Hymen joyn'd, grace you with measures then, Since they are both divine, and you are more then men. The Song. No longer wrong the night Of her Hymenaean right; A thousand Cupids call away, Fearing the approching day; The Cocks alreadie crow: Dance then and goe. [Vanish, vanish hence, confusion] CHORUS. Vanish, vanish hence, confusion; Dimme not Hymens goulden light With false illusion. The Fates shall doe him right, And faire Eternitie, Who passe through all enchantements free. ETERNITIE SINGES ALONE. Bring away this Sacred Tree, The Tree of Grace and Bountie, Set it in Bel-Annas eye, For she, she, only she Can all Knotted spels unty. Pull'd from the Stocke, let her blest Hands convay To any suppliant Hand, a bough, And let that Hand advance it now Against a Charme, that Charme shall fade away. Toward the end of this Song the three destinies set the Tree of Golde before the Queene. CHORUS. Since Knightly valour rescues Dames distressed, By Vertuous Dames let charm'd Knights be released. A Song while the Squires descend with the bough toward the Scene. Goe, happy man, like th'Evening Starre, Whose beames to Bride-groomes well-come are: May neither Hagge nor Feind withstand The pow're of thy Victorious Hand. The Uncharm'd Knights surrender now, By vertue of thy raised Bough. Away, Enchauntements, Vanish quite, No more delay our longing sight: 'Tis fruitelesse to contend with Fate, Who gives us pow're against your hate. Brave Knights, in Courtly pompe appeare, For now are you long-look't for heere. The third Song of three partes, with a Chorus of five partes, sung after the first Daunce. While dancing rests, fit place to musicke graunting, Good spels the Fates shall breath, al envy daunting, Kind eares with Joy enchaunting, chaunting. CHORUS. Io, Io Hymen. Like lookes, like hearts, like loves are linck't together: So must the Fates be pleas'd, so come they hether, To make this Joy persever ever. CHORUS. Io, Io Hymen. Love decks the spring, her buds to th'ayre exposing: Such fire here in these bridall Breasts reposing We leave with charmes enclosing, closing. CHORUS. Io, Io Hymen. The fourth Song, a Dialogue of three, with a Chorus after the second Daunce. 1 Let us now sing of Loves delight, For he alone is Lord to night. 2 Some friendship betweene man and man prefer, But I th'affection betweene man and wife. 3 What good can be in life, Whereof no fruites appeare? 1 Set is that Tree in ill houre, That yeilds neither fruite nor flowre. 2 How can man Perpetuall be, But in his owne Posteritie? CHORUS. That pleasure is of all most bountifull and kinde, That fades not straight, but leaves a living Joy behinde. [Come a shore, come, merrie mates] Come a shore, come, merrie mates, With your nimble heeles and pates: Summon ev'ry man his Knight, Enough honour'd is this night. Now, let your Sea-borne Goddesse come, Quench these lights, and make all dombe. Some sleepe; others let her call: And so Godnight to all, godnight to all. [Hast aboord, hast now away] Hast aboord, hast now away: Hymen frownes at your delay. Hymen doth long nights affect; Yeild him then his due respect. The Sea-borne Goddesse straight will come, Quench these lights, and make all dombe. Some Sleepe; others she will call: And so godnight to all, godnight to all. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TREATISES The Writer to his Booke. Whether thus hasts my little booke so fast? To Paules Churchyard. What? in those cels to stand, With one leafe like a riders cloke put up To catch a termer? or lye mustie there With rimes a terme set out, or two before? Some will redeeme me. Fewe. Yes, reade me too. Fewer. Nay love me. Now thou dot'st, I see. Will not our English Athens arte defend? Perhaps. Will lofty courtly wits not ayme Still at perfection? If I graunt? I flye. Whether? To Pawles. Alas, poore Booke, I rue Thy rash selfe-love; goe, spread thy pap'ry wings: Thy lightnes can not helpe, or hurt my fame. The second Chapter, declaring the unaptnesse of Rime in Poesie. [Goe, numbers, boldly passe, stay not for ayde] Goe, numbers, boldly passe, stay not for ayde Of shifting rime, that easie flatterer Whose witchcraft can the ruder eares beguile. Let your smooth feete, enur'd to purer arte, True measures tread. What if your pace be slow, And hops not like the Grecian elegies? It is yet gracefull, and well fits the state Of words ill-breathed, and not shap't to runne. Goe then, but slowly, till your steps be firme; Tell them that pitty or perversely skorne Poore English Poesie as the slave to rime, You are those loftie numbers that revive Triumphs of Princes, and sterne tragedies: And learne henceforth t'attend those happy sprights Whose bounding fury height and waight affects. Assist their labour, and sit close to them, Never to part away till for desert Their browes with great Apollos bayes are hid. He first taught number, and true harmonye; Nor is the lawrell his for rime bequeath'd. Call him with numerous accents paisd by arte, He'le turne his glory from the sunny clymes, The North-bred wits alone to patronise. Let France their Bartas, Italy Tasso prayse; Phaebus shuns none, but in their flight from him. The fifth Chapter, of the Iambick Dimeter, or English march. [Raving warre, begot] Raving warre, begot In the thirstye sands Of the Lybian Iles, Wasts our emptye fields; What the greedye rage Of fell wintrye stormes Could not turne to spoile, Fierce Bellona now Hath laid desolate, Voyd of fruit, or hope. Th'eger thriftye hinde, Whose rude toyle reviv'd Our skie-blasted earth, Himselfe is but earth, Left a skorne to fate Through seditious armes: And that soile, alive Which he duly nurst, Which him duly fed, Dead his body feeds: Yet not all the glebe His tuffe hands manur'd Now one turfe affords His poore funerall. Thus still needy lives, Thus still needy dyes Th'unknowne multitude. An example Lyrical. Greatest in thy wars, Greater in thy peace, Dread Elizabeth; Our muse only Truth, Figments cannot use, Thy ritch name to deck That it selfe adornes: But should now this age Let all poesye fayne, Fayning poesye could Nothing faine at all Worthy halfe thy fame. An example Epigrammaticall. Kind in every kinde, This, deare Ned, resolve, Never of thy prayse Be too prodigall; He that prayseth all Can praise truly none. The sixt Chapter, of the English Trochaick verse. The first Epigramme. Lockly spits apace, the rhewme he cals it Lockly spits apace, the rhewme he cals it, But no drop (though often urgd) he straineth From his thirstie jawes; yet all the morning And all day he spits, in ev'ry corner; At his meales he spits, at ev'ry meeting; At the barre he spits before the Fathers; In the Court he spits before the Graces; In the Church he spits, thus all prophaning With that rude disease, that empty spitting: Yet no cost he spares, he sees the Doctors, Keepes a strickt diet, precisely useth Drinks and bathes drying, yet all prevailes not. 'Tis not China (Lockly), Salsa Guacum, Nor dry Sassafras can helpe, or ease thee; 'Tis no humor hurts, it is thy humor. The second Epigramme. Cease, fond wretch, to love, so oft deluded Cease, fond wretch, to love, so oft deluded, Still made ritch with hopes, still unrelieved. Now fly her delaies; she that debateth Feeles not true desire; he that, deferred, Others times attends, his owne betrayeth: Learne t'affect thy selfe, thy cheekes deformed With pale care revive by timely pleasure, Or with skarlet heate them, or by paintings Make thee lovely; for such arte she useth Whome in vayne so long thy folly loved. The third Epigramme. Kate can fancy only berdles husbands Kate can fancy only berdles husbands, Thats the cause she shakes off ev'ry suter, Thats the cause she lives so stale a virgin, For, before her heart can heate her answer, Her smooth youths she finds all hugely berded. The fourth Epigramme. All in sattin Oteny will be suted All in sattin Oteny will be suted, Beaten sattin (as by chaunce he cals it); Oteny sure will have the bastinado. The fift Epigramme. Tosts as snakes or as the mortall Henbane Tosts as snakes or as the mortall Henbane Hunks detests when huffcap ale he tipples, Yet the bread he graunts the fumes abateth: Therefore apt in ale, true, and he graunts it; But it drinks up ale, that Hunks detesteth. The sixt Epigramme. What though Harry braggs, let him be noble What though Harry braggs, let him be noble; Noble Harry hath not halfe a noble. The seaventh Epigramme. Phoebe all the rights Elisa claymeth Phoebe all the rights Elisa claymeth, Mighty rivall, in this only diff'ring That shees only true, thou only fayned. The eight Epigramme. Barnzy stiffly vowes that hees no Cuckold Barnzy stiffly vowes that hees no Cuckold, Yet the vulgar ev'rywhere salutes him With strange signes of hornes, from ev'ry corner; Wheresoere he commes, a sundry Cucco Still frequents his eares; yet hees no Cuccold. But this Barnzy knowes that his Matilda, Skorning him, with Harvy playes the wanton. Knowes it? nay desires it, and by prayers Dayly begs of heav'n, that it for ever May stand firme for him; yet hees no Cuccold. And tis true, for Harvy keeps Matilda, Fosters Barnzy, and relieves his houshold, Buyes the Cradle, and begets the children, Payes the Nurces, ev'ry charge defraying, And thus truly playes Matildas husband: So that Barnzy now becomes a cypher, And himselfe th'adultrer of Matilda. Mock not him with hornes, the case is alterd; Harvy beares the wrong, he proves the Cuccold. The ninth Epigramme. Buffe loves fat vians, fat ale, fat all things Buffe loves fat vians, fat ale, fat all things, Keepes fat whores, fat offices, yet all men Him fat only wish to feast the gallous. The tenth Epigramme. Smith, by sute divorst, the knowne adultres Smith, by sute divorst, the knowne adultres Freshly weds againe; what ayles the mad-cap By this fury? euen so theeves by frailty Of their hemp reserv'd, againe the dismall Tree embrace, againe the fatall halter. The eleventh Epigramme. His late losse the Wiveless Higs in order His late losse the Wiveless Higs in order Ev'rywere bewailes to friends, to strangers; Tels them how by night a yongster armed Saught his Wife (as hand in hand he held her) With drawne sword to force; she cryed; he mainely Roring ran for ayde, but (ah) returning Fled was with the prize the beawty-forcer, Whome in vaine he seeks, he threats, he followes. Chang'd is Hellen, Hellen hugs the stranger, Safe as Paris in the Greeke triumphing. Therewith his reports to teares he turneth, Peirst through with the lovely Dames remembrance; Straight he sighes, he raves, his haire he teareth, Forcing pitty still by fresh lamenting. Cease, unworthy, worthy of thy fortunes, Thou that couldst so faire a prize deliver, For feare unregarded, undefended, Hadst no heart I thinke, I know no liver. The twelfth Epigramme. Why droopst thou, Trefeild? Why droopst thou, Trefeild? Will Hurst the Banker Make dice of thy bones? By heav'n he can not. Can not? whats the reason? Ile declare it: Th'ar all growne so pockie, and so rotten. The seaventh Chapter, of the English Elegeick verse. An Elegye. Constant to none, but ever false to me, Traiter still to love through thy faint desires, Not hope of pittie now nor vaine redresse Turns my griefs to teares, and renu'd laments. Too well thy empty vowes, and hollow thoughts Witnes both thy wrongs, and remorseles hart. Rue not my sorrow, but blush at my name; Let thy bloudy cheeks guilty thoughts betray. My flames did truly burne, thine made a shew, As fires painted are which no heate retayne, Or as the glossy Pirop faines to blaze, But, toucht, cold appeares, and an earthy stone. True cullours deck thy cheeks, false foiles thy brest, Frailer then thy light beawty is thy minde. None canst thou long refuse, nor long affect, But turn'st feare with hopes, sorrow with delight, Delaying, and deluding ev'ry way Those whose eyes are once with thy beawty chain'd. Thrice happy man that entring first thy love Can so guide the straight raynes of his desires, That both he can regard thee, and refraine: If grac't, firme he stands, if not, easely falls. Example of Epigrams, in Elegeick verse. The first Epigramme. Arthure brooks only those that brooke not him Arthure brooks only those that brooke not him, Those he most regards, and devoutly serves: But them that grace him his great brav'ry skornes, Counting kindnesse all duty, not desert: Arthure wants forty pounds, tyres ev'ry friend, But finds none that holds twenty due for him. The second Epigramme. If fancy can not erre which vertue guides If fancy can not erre which vertue guides, In thee, Laura, then fancy can not erre. The third Epigramme. Drue feasts no Puritans Drue feasts no Puritans; the churles, he saith, Thanke no men, but eate, praise God, and depart. The fourth Epigramme. A wiseman wary lives, yet most secure A wiseman wary lives, yet most secure, Sorrowes move not him greatly, nor delights. Fortune and death he skorning, only makes Th'earth his sober Inne, but still heav'n his home. The fift Epigramme. Thou telst me, Barnzy, Dawson hath a wife Thou telst me, Barnzy, Dawson hath a wife: Thine he hath, I graunt; Dawson hath a wife. The sixt Epigramme. Drue gives thee money, yet thou thankst not him Drue gives thee money, yet thou thankst not him, But thankst God for him, like a godly man. Suppose, rude Puritan, thou begst of him, And he saith God help, who's the godly man? The seaventh Epigramme. All wonders Barnzy speakes, all grosely faind All wonders Barnzy speakes, all grosely faind: Speake some wonder once, Barnzy, speake the truth. The eight Epigramme. None then should through thy beawty, Lawra, pine None then should through thy beawty, Lawra, pine, Might sweet words alone ease a love-sick heart: But your sweet words alone, that quit so well Hope of friendly deeds, kill the love-sick heart. The ninth Epigramme. At all thou frankly throwst At all thou frankly throwst, while, Frank, thy wife Bars not Luke the mayn; Oteny, barre the bye. The eight Chapter, of Ditties and Odes. The English Sapphick. Faiths pure shield, the Christian Diana, Englands glory crownd with all devinenesse, Live long with triumphs to blesse thy people At thy sight triumphing. Loe, they sound; the Knights in order armed Entring threat the list, adrest to combat For their courtly loves; he, hees the wonder Whome Eliza graceth. Their plum'd pomp the vulgar heaps detaineth, And rough steeds; let us the still devices Close observe, the speeches and the musicks Peacefull arms adorning. But whence showres so fast this angry tempest, Clowding dimme the place? Behold, Eliza This day shines not here; this heard, the launces And thick heads do vanish. The Example. [Rose-cheekt Lawra, come] Rose-cheekt Lawra, come, Sing thou smoothly with thy beawties Silent musick, either other Sweetely gracing. Lovely formes do flowe From concent devinely framed; Heav'n is musick, and thy beawties Birth is heavenly. These dull notes we sing Discords neede for helps to grace them; Only beawty purely loving Knowes no discord: But still mooves delight, Like cleare springs renu'd by flowing, Ever perfect, ever in them- selves eternall. The Example. [Just beguiler] Just beguiler, Kindest love, yet only chastest, Royall in thy smooth denyals, Frowning or demurely smiling, Still my pure delight. Let me view thee With thoughts and with eyes affected, And if then the flames do murmur, Quench them with thy vertue, charme them With thy stormy browes. Heav'n so cheerefull Laughs not ever, hory winter Knowes his season, even the freshest Sommer mornes from angry thunder Jet not still secure. The ninth Chapter, of the Anacreontick Verse. [Follow, followe] Follow, followe, Though with mischiefe Arm'd, like whirlewind, Now she flyes thee; Time can conquer Loves unkindnes; Love can alter Times disgraces; Till death faint not Then, but followe. Could I catch that Nimble trayter, Skornefull Lawra, Swift foote Lawra, Soone then would I Seeke avengement. Whats th'avengement? Even submissely Prostrate then to Beg for mercye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DOUBTFUL POEMS A BOOKE OF AYRES, PART II I.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Sweete, come againe] Sweete, come againe; Your happie sight, so much desir'd, Since you from hence are now retir'd, I seeke in vaine. Stil must I mourn And pine in longing paine, Till you, my lives delight, againe Vouchsafe your wisht returne. If true desire, Or faithfull vow of endles love, Thy heart enflam'd may kindly move With equall fire; O then my joies, So long destraught, shall rest, Reposed soft in thy chast brest, Exempt from all annoies. You had the power My wandring thoughts first to restraine, You first did heare my love speake plaine, A child before: Now it is growne Confirm'd, do you it keepe, And let it safe in your bosome sleepe, There ever made your owne. And till we meete, Teach absence inward art to find, Both to disturbe and please the mind. Such thoughts are sweete, And such remaine In hearts whose flames are true; Then such will I retaine, till you To me returne againe. II.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [And would you see my Mistris face?] And would you see my Mistris face? it is a flowrie garden place, Where knots of beauties have such grace that all is worke and nowhere space. It is a sweete delicious morne, where day is breeding, never borne, It is a Meadow yet unshorne, whome thousand flowers do adorne. It is the heavens bright reflexe, weake eies to dazle and to vexe, It is th'Idaea of her sexe, envie of whome doth world perplexe. It is a face of death that smiles, pleasing, though it killes the whiles, Where death and love in pretie wiles each other mutuallie beguiles. It is faire beauties freshest youth, it is the fain'd Eliziums truth: The spring that winter'd harts renu'th; and this is that my soule pursu'th. III.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [No grave for woe, yet earth my watrie teares devoures] No grave for woe, yet earth my watrie teares devoures; Sighes want ayre, and burnt desires kind pitties showres: Stars hold their fatal course, my joies preventing: The earth, the sea, the aire, the fire, the heav'ns vow my tormenting. Yet still I live, and waste my wearie daies in grones, And with wofull tunes adorne dispayring mones. Night still prepares a more displeasing morrow; My day is night, my life my death, and all but sence of sorrow. IV.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [If I urge my kinde desires] If I urge my kinde desires, She unkind doth them reject; Womens hearts are painted fires To deceive them that affect. I alone loves fires include, Shee alone doth them delude. Shee hath often vow'd her love, But, alas, no fruit I finde. That her fires are false I prove, Yet in her no fault I finde: I was thus unhappy borne, And ordain'd to be her scorne. Yet if humane care, or paine, May the heav'nly order change, She will hate her owne disdaine, And repent she was so strange: For a truer heart then I Never liv'd, or lov'd to die. V.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [What harts content can he finde] What harts content can he finde, What happy sleepes can his eies embrace, That beares a guiltie minde? His tast sweet wines wil abhorre: No musicks sounde can appease the thoughts That wicked deeds deplore. The passion of a present feare Stil makes his restles motion there; And all the day hee dreads the night, And all the night, as one agast, hee feares the morning light But he that loves to be lov'd, And in his deedes doth adore heavens power, And is with pitie mov'd; The night gives rest to his heart, The cheerefull beames do awake his soule, Revived in everie part. He lives a comfort to his friendes, And heaven to him such blessing sendes That feare of hell cannot dismaie His stedfast hart that is enurd the truth still to obey VI.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Let him that will be free and keep his hart from care] Let him that will be free and keep his hart from care, Retir'd alone, remaine where no discomforts are. For when the eie doth view his griefe, or haplesse eare his sorrow heares, Th'impression still in him abides, and ever in one shape appeares. Forget thy griefes betimes; long sorrow breedes long paine, For joie, farre fled from men, will not returne againe; O happie is the soule which heaven ordained to live in endles peace: His life is a pleasing dreame, and everie houre his joyes encrease. You heavie sprites, that love in sever'd shades to dwell, That nurse despaire, and dreame of unrelenting hell, Come sing this happie song, and learne of me the Arte of true content, Loade not your guiltie soules with wrong, and heaven then will soone relent. VII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Reprove not love, though fondly thou hast lost] Reprove not love, though fondly thou hast lost Greater hopes by loving: Love calms ambicious spirits, from their brests Danger oft removing: Let lofty humors mount up on high, Down againe like to the wind, While privat thoughts, vow'd to love, More peace and pleasure find. Love and sweete beautie makes the stubborne milde, And the coward fearelesse, The wretched misers care to bountie turnes, Cheering all thinges cheerelesse; Love chaines the earth and heaven, Turnes the Spheares, guides the yeares in endles peace; The flourie earth through his power Receiv's her due encrease. VIII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [And would you faine the reason know] And would you faine the reason know why my sad eies so often flow? My heart ebs joy when they doe so, and loves the moone by whom they go. And will you aske why pale I looke? tis not with poring on my booke: My Mistris cheeke my bloud hath tooke, for her mine owne hath me forsooke. Doe not demaund why I am mute: loves silence doth all speech confute. They set the noat, then tune the Lute, harts frame their thoughts, then toongs their suit. Doe not admire why I admire: my fever is no others fire; Each severall heart hath his desire, els proofe is false, and truth a lier. If why I love you should see cause: love should have forme like other lawes; But fancie pleads not by the clawes, tis as the sea, still vext with flawes. No fault upon my love espie, for you perceive not with my eie; My pallate to your tast may lie, yet please it selfe deliciously. Then let my sufferance be mine owne: sufficeth it these reasons showne; Reason and love are ever knowne to fight till both be overthrowne. IX.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [When Laura smiles her sight revives both night and day] When Laura smiles her sight revives both night and day, The earth and heaven viewes with delight her wanton play, And her speech with ever-flowing musicke doth repaire The cruell wounds of sorrow and untam'd despaire. The sprites that remaine in fleeting aire Affect for pastime to untwine her tressed haire, And the birds thinke sweete Aurora, mornings Queene, doth shine From her bright sphere, when Laura shewes her lookes devine. Dianas eyes are not adorn'd with greater power Then Lauras, when she lists awhile for sport to loure: But when she her eyes encloseth, blindnes doth appeare The chiefest grace of beautie, sweetlie seated there. Love hath no fire but what he steales from her bright eyes, Time hath no power but that which in her pleasure lyes: For she with her devine beauties all the world subdues, And fils with heav'nly spirits my humble muse. X.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Long have mine eies gaz'd with delight] Long have mine eies gaz'd with delight, Conveying hopes unto my soule; In nothing happy, but in sight Of her, that doth my sight controule: But now mine eies must loose their light. My object now must be the aire, To write in water words of fire, And teach sad thoughts how to despaire: Desert must quarrell with desire. All were appeas'd were she not faire. For all my comfort, this I prove, That Venus on the Sea was borne: If Seas be calme, then doth she love, If stormes arise, I am forlorne: My doubtfull hopes like wind doe move. XI.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Though far from joy, my sorrowes are as far] Though far from joy, my sorrowes are as far, And I both betweene: Not too low, nor yet too high Above my reach, would I bee seene. Happy is he that so is placed, Not to be envi'd, nor to bee disdain'd or disgraced. The higher trees, the more stormes they endure, Shrubs be troden downe: But the meane, the golden meane, Doth onely all our fortunes crowne: Like to a streame that sweetely slideth Through the flourie banks, and still in the midst his course guideth. XII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Shal I come, if I swim? wide are the waves, you see] Shal I come, if I swim? wide are the waves, you see: Shall I come, if I flie, my deere love, to thee? Streames Venus will appease, Cupid gives me winges: All the powers assist my desire Save you alone, that set my wofull heart on fire. You are faire; so was Hero that in Sestos dwelt; She a priest, yet the heate of love truly felt. A greater streame then this did her love devide, But she was his guide with a light: So through the streames Leander did enjoy her sight. XIII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Aye me, that love should natures workes accuse!] Aye me, that love should natures workes accuse! Where cruell Laura still her beautie viewes, River, or cloudie jet, or christall bright, Are all but servants of her selfe-delight. Yet her deformed thoughts she cannot see, And thats the cause she is so sterne to mee. Vertue and duetie can no favour gaine: O griefe, a death, to live and love in vaine! XIV.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Shall then a traiterous kis or a smile] Shall then a traiterous kis or a smile All my delights unhappily beguile? Shall the vow of fayned love receive so ritch regard, When true service dies neglected, and wants his due reward? Deedes meritorious soone be forgot, But one offence no time can ever blot; Every day it is renu'd, and every night it bleedes, And with bloudy streames of sorrow drownes all our better deedes. Beautie is not by desert to be woon, Fortune hath all that is beneath the Sunne; Fortune is the guide of love, and both of them be blind: All their waies are full of errors, which no true feete can find. XV.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [If I hope, I pine; if I feare, I faint and die] If I hope, I pine; if I feare, I faint and die; So betweene hope and feare I desp'rat lie, Looking for joy to heaven, whence it should come: But hope is blinde, joy deafe, and I am dumbe. Yet I speake and crie, but alas with words of wo; And joy conceives not them that murmure so. He that the eares of joy will ever pearse Must sing glad noates, or speake in happier verse. XVI.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Unlesse there were consent twixt hell and heaven] Unlesse there were consent twixt hell and heaven That grace and wickednes should be combind, I cannot make thee and thy beauties even; Thy face is heaven, and torture in thy minde: For more then worldly blisse is in thy eie, And hellish torture in thy minde doth lie. A thousand Cherubins flie in her lookes, And hearts in legions melt upon their view: But gorgeous covers wall up filthie bookes; Be it sinne to saie, that so your eyes do you: But sure your mind adheres not with your eies, For what they promise, that your heart denies. But O, least I religion should misuse, Inspire me thou, that ought'st thy selfe to know, Since skillesse readers reading do abuse, What inward meaning outward sence doth show: For by thy eies and heart, chose and contem'd, I waver, whether saved or condemn'd. XVII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [If she forsake me, I must die] If she forsake me, I must die: Shall I tell her so? Alas, then strait she will replie, No, no, no, no, no. If I disclose my desp'rat state, She will but make sport thereat, And more unrelenting grow. What heart can long such paines abide? Fie uppon this love. I would adventure farre and wide, If it would remove. But love will still my steppes pursue, I cannot his wayes eschew: Thus still helpeles hopes I prove. I doe my love in lines commend, But, alas, in vaine; The costly gifts that I doe send She returnes againe: Thus still is my despaire procur'd, And her malice more assur'd: Then come, death, and end my paine. XVIII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [What is a day, what is a yeere] What is a day, what is a yeere Of vaine delight and pleasure? Like to a dreame it endlesse dies, And from us like a vapour flies: And this is all the fruit that we finde, Which glorie in worldly treasure. He that will hope for true delight With vertue must be graced; Sweet follie yeelds a bitter tast, Which ever will appeare at last: But if we still in vertue delight, Our soules are in heaven placed. XIX.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Kinde in unkindnesse, when will you relent] Kinde in unkindnesse, when will you relent And cease with faint love true love to torment? Still entertain'd, excluded still I stand, Her glove stil holde, but cannot touch the hand. In her faire hand my hopes and comforts rest: O might my fortunes with that hand be blest, No envious breaths then my deserts could shake, For they are good whom such true love doth make. O let not beautie so forget her birth That it should fruitles home returne to earth: Love is the fruite of beautie, then love one; Not your sweete selfe, for such selfe love is none. Love one that onely lives in loving you, Whose wrong'd deserts would you with pity view: This strange distast which your affections swaies Would relish love, and you find better daies. Thus till my happie sight your beautie viewes, Whose sweet remembrance stil my hope renewes, Let these poore lines sollicite love for mee, And place my joyes where my desires would bee. XX.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [What thing is love but mourning?] What thing is love but mourning? What desire, but a selfe-burning? Till shee that hates doth love returne, Thus will I mourne, thus will I sing, Come away, come away, my darling. Beautie is but a blooming, Youth in his glorie entombing; Time hath a wheel which none can stay: Then come away, while thus I sing, Come away, come away, my darling. Sommer in winter fadeth, Gloomie night heav'nly light shadeth, Like to the morne are Venus flowers; Such are her howers: then will I sing, Come away, come away, my darling. XXI.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Whether men doe laugh or weepe] Whether men doe laugh or weepe, Whether they doe wake or sleepe, Whether they die yoong or olde, Whether they feele heate or colde, There is, underneath the sunne, Nothing in true earnest done. All our pride is but a jest; None are worst, and none are best; Griefe, and joy, and hope, and feare Play their Pageants every where: Vaine opinion all doth sway, And the world is but a play. Powers above in cloudes doe sit, Mocking our poore apish wit That so lamely, with such state, Their high glorie imitate: No ill can be felt but paine, And that happie men disdaine. FINIS. THE AYRES THAT WERE SUNG AND PLAYED, at Brougham Castle in Westmerland, in the Kings Entertainment: Given by the Right Honourable the EARLE of CUMBERLAND, and his Right Noble Sonne the LORD CLIFFORD. COMPOSED BY Mr. GEORGE MASON, and Mr. JOHN EARSDEN. I. A DIALOGUE SUNG THE FIRST NIGHT, The King being at supper. CANTUS. Tune thy chearefull voyce to mine, Musicke helpes digesting. TENOR. Musicke is as good as wine, And as fit for feasting. CANT. Melodie now is needfull here, It will helpe to mend our cheare. BOTH. Joyne then, one joy expressing. CANT. Here is a guest for whose content All excesse were sparing. TEN. All to him present, Hourely new delights preparing. CHORUS. Joy at thy board, health in thy dish, Mirth in thy cup, and in thy bed Soft sleepe and pleasing rest wee wish. CANT. Earth and ayre and Sea consent In thy entertaining. TEN. All is old which they present, Yet all choice contayning. CANT. Musick alone the soule can feast, It being new and well exprest; BOTH. Joyne then, sweet cords enchaining. CANT. Could we to our wisht ends aspire, Joy should crowne thy dishes. TEN. Proud is our desire, If thou dost accept our wishes. CHORUS. Joy at thy board, health in thy dish, Mirth in thy cup, and in thy bed Soft sleepe and pleasing rest wee wish. II. Another Dialogue, to be sung at the same time. CANT. Now is the time, now is the hower When joy first blest this happy Bower: TEN. Here is a sight that sweetens every sower. CANT. So shines the Moon by night, TEN. So looks the Sun by day; CANT. Heavenly is his light, TEN. And never shal decay. CHORUS. There is no voice enough can sing The praise of our great King. CANT. Fal, showers of sweet delight; TEN. Spring, flowers of plesant mirth; CANT. What heaven hath beams that shine more bright? TEN. Here heven is now, stars shine on earth. CANT. In one all honor groweth, TEN. From one all comfort floweth: BOTH. Dutie saith that to this one all it hath it oweth. CHORUS. Let then that one of all be praised That hath our fortunes raised. III. The Kings Good-night. Welcome, welcome, King of guests With thy Princely traine, With joyfull Triumphs and with Feasts Be welcom'd home againe. Frolicke mirth, The soule of earth, Shall watch for thy delight: Knees shall bend From friend to friend While full cups doe thee right: And so, great King, good-night. Welcome, welcome as the Sunne When the night is past: With us the day is now begunne, May it for ever last. Such a morne Did nere adorne The Roses of the East, As the North Hath now brought forth: The Northerne morne is best. And so, best King, good rest. IV. [Come follow me, my wandring mates] Come follow me, my wandring mates, Sonnes and daughters of the Fates: Friends of night, that oft have done Homage to the horned Moone, Fairely march, and shun not light, With such stars as these made bright; Yet bend you low your curled tops, Touch the hallowed earth, and then Rise agen with anticke hops Unus'd of men. Here no danger is, nor feare, For true Honour harbours here, Whom Grace attends. Grace can make our foes our friends. V. A Ballad. Dido was the Carthage Queene And lov'd the Trojan Knight, That wandring many coasts had seene And many a dreadfull fight: As they on hunting road, a shower Drave them, in a loving hower, Downe to a darksome cave: Where Aeneas with his charmes Lockt Queene Dido in his armes And had what hee could have. Dido Hymens Rites forgot, Her love was wing'd with haste: Her honour shee considered not, But in her breast him plac't. And, when her love was new begunne, Jove sent downe his winged Sonne To fright Aeneas sleepe; Bad him by the breake of day From Queene Dido steale away: Which made her waile and weepe. Dido wept, but what of this? The Gods would have it so: Aeneas nothing did amisse, For hee was forc't to goe. Learne, Lordings, then, no faith to keepe With your Loves, but let them weepe: 'Tis folly to be true. Let this Story serve your turne, And let twenty Didoes burne So you get daily new. VI. The Dance. CANT. Robin is a lovely Lad, No Lasse a smother ever had. BASS. Tommy hath a looke as bright As is the rosie morning light. BASS. Tib is darke and browne of hue, But, like her colour, firme and true. TEN. Ginny hath a lip to kisse Wherein a spring of Nectar is. TEN. Simkin well his mirth can place, And words to win a womans grace. TEN. Sib is all in all to me, There is no Queene of Love but she. ALL. Let us in a lovers round Circle all this hallowed ground. Softly, softly trip and goe: The light foot Fairies jet it so. Forward, then, And backe againe; Here and there, And everywhere, Winding to and winding fro, Skipping hye and lowting low. CHORUS. And, like lovers hand in hand, March a round and make a stand. VII. A Song. The shadowes darkning our intents Must fade, and Truth now take her place, Who, in our right Aegyptian race, A chaine of Prophecies presents With which the starry Skye consents, And all the under-Elements. Thou that art all divine, give eare, And grace our humble Songs That speak what to thy State belongs Unmasked now and cleare; Which wee in severall straines divide, And heaven-borne Truth our Notes shall guide, One by one, while wee relate That which shall tye both Time and Fate. VIII. [Truth, sprung from heaven, shall shine] CANT. Truth, sprung from heaven, shall shine, With her beames divine, On all thy Land, And there for ever stedfast stand. BASS. Lovely peace, Spring of increase, Shall like a precious gemme Adorne thy Royall Diademe. TEN. Love, that bindes Loyall mindes, Shall make all hearts agree To magnifie thy state and thee. TEN. Honour, that proceeds Out of noble deeds, Shall waite on thee alone, And cast a sacred light about thy Throne. BASS. Long shall thy three Crownes remaine, Blessed in thy long-liv'd raigne. Thy age shall like fresh youth appeare, And perpetuall Roses beare. TEN. Many on earth thy dayes shall be, But endlesse thy posteritie, And matchlesse thy posteritie. CHORUS. Truth, Peace, Love, Honour, and Long-life attend Thee, and all those that from thy loynes descend: With us the Angels in this Chorus meet: So humbly prostrate at thy sacred feet, Our nightly sports and prophesies wee end. IX. The Farewell Song. O stay! sweet is the least delay, When parting forceth mourning: O Joy! too soone thy flowers decay, From Rose to Bryer returning. Bright beames that now shine here, When you are parted, All will be dimme, all will be dumbe, And every breast sad hearted. Yet more, for true love may presume, If it exceede not measure. O griefe! that blest houres soone consume, But joylesse pass at leasure. Since wee this light must lose, Our love expressing: Farre may it shine, long may it live, To all a publique blessing. X. The Lords Welcome, sung before the Kings Good-night. Welcome is the word, The best love can afford: For what can better be? Welcome, Lords, the time drawes neare When each one shall embrace his deare, And view the face hee longs to see. Absence makes the houre more sweet When divided lovers meet. Welcome once againe, Though too much were in vaine: Yet how can love exceed? Princely Guests, wee wish there were Joves Nectar and Ambrosia here, That you might like immortals feed, Changing shapes like full-fed Jove In the sweet pursuit of love. FINIS. POEMS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES 1. [What if a day, or a month, or a yeare] What if a day, or a month, or a yeare Crown thy delights with a thousand sweet contentings? Cannot a chance of a night or an howre Crosse thy desires with as many sad tormentings? Fortune, honor, beauty, youth Are but blossoms dying; Wanton pleasure, doating love, Are but shadowes flying. All our joyes are but toyes, Idle thoughts deceiving; None have power of an howre In their lives bereaving. Earthes but a point to the world, and a man Is but a point to the worlds compared centure: Shall then a point of a point be so vaine As to triumph in a seely points adventure? All is hassard that we have, There is nothing biding; Dayes of pleasure are like streames Through faire meadowes gliding. Weale and woe, time doth goe, Time is never turning: Secret fates guide our states, Both in mirth and mourning. 2. A Hymne in praise of Neptune. Of Neptunes Empyre let us sing, At whose command the waves obay: To whom the Rivers tribute pay, Downe the high mountaines sliding. To whom the skaly Nation yeelds Homage for the Cristall fields Wherein they dwell; And every Sea-god paies a Jem, Yeerely out of his watry Cell, To decke great Neptunes Diadem. The Trytons dauncing in a ring, Before his Pallace gates, doo make The water with their Ecchoes quake, Like the great Thunder sounding: The Sea-Nymphes chaunt their Accents shrill, And the Syrens taught to kill With their sweet voyce, Make ev'ry ecchoing Rocke reply, Unto their gentle murmuring noyse, The prayse of Neptunes Empery.This Hymne was sung by Amphitryte, Thamesis, and other Sea-Nimphes in Grayes-Inne Maske, at the Court. 1594. Th. Campion. 3. [Shadowes before the shining sunne do vanish] Shadowes before the shining sunne do vanish, The iron forcing Adamant doth resigne His vertues where the Diamond doth shine; Pure holines doth all enchantment banish, And cullors of false Principallity Do fade in presence of true majesty. Sheapheards sometymes in Lyons skins were cloathde, But when the Royall Lyon did appeare, What wonder though the sylly swaynes for feare Theyr bravery and princely pale have loathed? The Lyons skinn that graict our vanity Falls down in presence of your Majesty. 4. Dolus Thou shalt not love mee, neither shall these eyes Shine on my soule shrowded in deadly night. Thou shalt not breath on me thy spiceryes Nor rocke mee in the quavers of delight. Hould of thy hands, for I had rather dye Then have my life by thy coye touch reprived. Smile not on me, but frowne thou bitterly; Slaye me out right: no lovers are long liv'de. As for those lippes reserv'd so much in store, Their rosy verdure shall not meete with myne. Withhould thy proude embracements evermore, I'le not be swadled in those arms of thyne. Now shew it if thou be a woman right: Embrace and kisse and love mee in despight. finis Tho: Camp: 5. [Thrice tosse those oaken ashes in the ayer] Thrice tosse those oaken ashes in the ayer, And thrice three tymes tye up this true-lovs Knott; Thrice sitt you downe in this inchanted chaire And murmure softe, Shee will or shee will not. Goe burne those poysoned weeds in that blew fyre, This Cypres gathered out a dead mans grave, These Scretchowles fethers and the prickling bryer That all thy Thornye cares an end may have. Then come you fairyes, daunce with mee a round, Daunce in a Circle, let my Love be Center. Melodiously breath an inchanted sound, Melt her hard harte, that some remorse may enter. In vayne are all the Charmes I can devise: She hath an arte to breake them with her eyes. finis Idem. 6. Beautie without Love deformitie Thou art not fayer for all thy red and white, For all those Rosye temperatures in thee; Thou art not sweet, though made of meere delight, Nor fayer nor sweet unlesse thou pittie mee. Thyne eyes are blacke and yet their glittering brightnes Can night enlumine in her darkest den; Thy hands are bloudy thoughts contriv'd of whitnes, Both blacke and blooddy if they murder men. Thy browe wheron my good happe doth depend Fayerer then snow or lyllie in the springe, Thy Tongue which saves at every sweete words end, That hard as Marble, This a mortall sting. I will not soothe thy follyes: thou shalt prove That Beautie is no Beautie without Love. finis Idem. 7. [Do not, O do not prize thy beauty at too high a rate] Do not, O do not prize thy beauty at too high a rate: Love to be lov'd whilst thou art lovely, least thou love too late; Frownes print wrincles in thy browes, At which spightfull age doth smile, Women in their froward vowes Glorying to beguile. Wert thou the onely worlds admired, thou canst love but one; But many have before beene lov'd, thou art not lov'd alone: Couldst thou speake with heavenly grace, Sapho might with thee compare; Blush the Roses in thy face, Rozamond was as fair. Pride is the canker that consumeth beautie in her prime, They that delight in long debating feele the curse of time. All things with the time do change That will not the time obey; Some even to themselves seeme strange Thorowe their owne delay. 8. [Some can flatter, some can faine] Some can flatter, some can faine; Simple trueth shall pleade for mee. Let not beautie trueth disdaine: Trueth is even as faire as shee. But, since Paires must equall prove, Let my strength her youth oppose: Love her beautie, faith her love; On ev'n terms so may we close. Corke or Leade in equall waight Both one just proportion yeeld; So may breadth be pays'd with height, Steepest mount with plainest field. Vertues have not all one kind, Yet all vertues merits bee: Divers vertues are combind, Diff'ring so Deserts agree. Let then love and beautie meete, Making one divine concent, Constant as the sounds, and sweete, That enchant the firmament. 9. [My deerest mistrisse, let us live and love] My deerest mistrisse, let us live and love, And care not what old doting fools reprove. Let us not feare their censures, nor esteeme What they of us and of our loves shall deeme. Old ages critticke and censorious brow Cannot of youthful dalliance alow, Nor ever could endure that we should tast Of those delights which they themselves are past. 10. [Art thou that shee then whome noe fayrer is?] Art thou that shee then whome noe fayrer is? Art thou that shee desier soe strives to kisse? Say I am, how then? Maids may not kisse Such wanton humord men. Art thou that shee the world commends for witt? Art thou soe wise, and makst noe use of it? Say I am, how then? My witt doth teach me shun Such foolish foolish men. 11. [As on a day Sabina fell asleepe] As on a day Sabina fell asleepe, Into her bower by stealth then I did creepe: And first spake softe, then loude unto my deare; And still Sabina heard, but would not heare. Then to my selfe more courage did I take. When I preceiv'd shee did both winke and wake, Then downe I lay'd mee by her on the ground, And still awake, asleepe, Sabina found. Then shew'd her sightes more strange to her then mee, Yet still Sabina sawe, but would not see. Now when as I had try'd all waies but one, I lookt about, and found my selfe alone. Then thought it best, the best waie for to wooe, And still Sabina did, but would not doe: Then did I touch each part from head to heele, Yet still Sabina felt but would not feele. Nowe from the doer whie should shee have hid it, Yf it be true that twas Sabina did it? But shee saies nay; I sweare and saie soe too: Shee did both heare, and see, and feele, and doe. 12. [The peacefull westerne winde the wintrye stormes hath calmde] The peacefull westerne winde the wintrye stormes hath calmde, And nature hath in every kinde the vitall heate inflam'de; The flowers so sweetlye breathe out of the earthlye bowers That heaven, which seeth their pompe benethe, would faine be decte with flowers; To grace the lyvely springe let all the shepheards singe, Fa la la la. See how the morninge smyles out of the easterne Cell, And, softly stealinge forthe, beguiles them that in sleepe do dwell; The frolicke birds do come from cliffs and Rocks unknowne To see the treese and briers blow that late were overflowene: All things do us invite to sing with sweete delite, Fa la la la. What Nature did destroye renewes, revives againe, And now the wanton naked boye doth in the woods remain: Where he such Change doth Vewe in everye livinge thinge As if the worlde were borne a newe to gratifie the springe. To Cynthia then lett us recorde our musicke thus: Fa la la la. 13. [Could my poore hart whole worlds of toungs employ] Could my poore hart whole worlds of toungs employ, The greifes it ownes that number would out goe; Its so enured to greife, s' estranged from joy, That it knows not how it releife should know. Discurteous facts are cor'sives to true hearts, And those are pronest to dispayring smarts. Noe caution, thought, nor alteration can Assume affections place; change harder is Fancied to be; use Lords it soe ore man That it brooks worst what's strange as being amisse. And soe much witt should men in this age have As they should chuse what's good and what's not leave. Those men are blest that can their freedom get Whensoere they will, and free themselves from thrall; That hope disdaines, on joy a rate doth set Inferiour far to th'blisse that ease men call: A blest estate had better nere been knowne Then from the height thereof downe to be throwne. 14. [Whether away my sweetest deerest?] Whether away my sweetest deerest? Whether away will you depart? Will you from mee that should bee neerest, Will you from mee that have my hart? No, no, no, no: bee with mee ever, For on you my joyes do all relie; Say then, o say, you'l leve mee never, For if you forsake mee I must dye. 15. [Hide not, sweetest Love, a sight so pleasing] Hide not, sweetest Love, a sight so pleasing As those smalls so light composed, Those fair pillars your knees gently easing, That tell wonders, being disclosed. O show me yet a little more: Here's the way, bar not the door. How like sister's twines these knees are joined To resist my bold approaching! Why should beauty lurk like mines uncoined? Love is right and no encroaching. O show me yet a little more: Here's the way, bar not the door.</field>
