      <field name="fulltext">The Virgine Maries conception. Ovr second Eue puts on her mortall shrowde, Earth breeds a heauen, for Gods new dwelling place, Now riseth vp Elias little clowde That growing, shall distill the showre of grace: Her being now begins, who ere she end, Shall bring our good that shall our ill amend, Both Grace and Nature did their force vnite, To make this babe the summe of all their best, Our most, her least, our million, but her mite: She was at easiest rate worth all the rest, What grace to men or Angells God did part, Was all vnited in this infants heart. Foure onely wights, bred without fault are namde, And all the rest conceiued were in sinne, Without both man and wife was Adam framde Of man, but not of wife did Eue beginne, Wife without touch of man Christs mother was, Of man and wife this babe was borne in grace. Her Natiuitie. Ioy in the rising of our Orient starre, That shall bring forth the Sunne that lent her light, Ioy in the peace that shall conclude our warre, And soone rebate the edge of sathans spight, Load-starre of all inclosed in worldly waues, The care and compasse that from ship-wracke saues, The patriarchs and Prophets were the flowers, Which Time by course of ages did distill, And cal'd into his little clowde the showers, Whose gratious drops the world with ioy shall fill, Whose moisture suppleth euery soule with grace, And bringeth life to Adams dying race. For God on earth she is the royall throne, The chosen cloth to make his mortall weede, The quarry to cut out our corner stone, Soile ful of fruite, yet free from mortall seede, For heauenly flowre she is the Iessa rod, The child of man, the parent of a god. Her Spousalls. Wife did she liue, yet virgine did she die, Vntaught of man, yet mother of a sonne, To saue her selfe and child from fatall lie, To end the web whereof the thred was spon In marriage knots to Ioseph she was tide Vnwonted workes with wonted wiles to hide, God lent his Paradise to Iosephs care Wherein he was to plant the tree of life, His sonne of Iosephs child the title bare: Iust cause to make the mother Iosephs wife O blessed man betroth'd too much a spouse, More bless'd to liue with such a child in house, No carnall loue his sacred league procurde, All vaine delights were farre from their assent, Though both themselues in wedlocke bands assurde, Yet chaste by vow they seald their chaste intent Thus had the Virgins, wiues, and widows crowne, And by chaste child-birth dubled their renowne. The virgins salutation. Spell Eua backe, and Aue shall you finde, The first began, the last reuerst our harmes, An Angels Aue disinchants the charmes, Death first by womans weaknes entred in, In womans vertue life doth now begin. O Virgins breast, the heauens to thee incline, In thee they ioy, and soueraigne they agnize, Too meane their glorie is to match with thine, Whose chaste receit God more then heauen did prize, Haile fairest heauen, that heauen and earth doe blisse, Where vertues starre, Gods sunne of iustice is, With hauty mind to godhead man aspirde, And was by pride from place of pleasure chac'de, With louing mind our manhood God desired, And vs by loue in greater pleasure plac'de, Man labouring to ascend procurde our fall, God yeelding to discend cut off our thrall. The Visitation. Proclaimed Queene and mother of a God, The light of earth, the soueraigne of Saints, With Pilgrim foote, vp tyring hils she trod, And heauenly stile with handmaids toile acquaints, Her youth to age, her selfe to sicke she lends, Her heart to God, to neighbour hand shee bends. A prince she is, and mightier prince doth beare, Yet pompe of princely traine she would not haue, But doubtlesse heauenly Quires attendant were, Her child from harme her selfe from fall to saue, Word to the voice, song to the tune she brings, The voice her word, the tune her ditty sings, Eternall lights inclosed in her breast, Shot out such piercing beames of burning loue, That when her voice her cosens cares possest, The force thereof did force her babe to moue, With secret signes the children greet each other, But open praise each leaueth to his mother. His circumcision. The head is launst to worke the bodies cure, With angry salue it smarts to heal our wo?d To faultlesse sonne from all offences pure, The faulty vassals scourges do redound, The Iudge is cast the guiltie to acquite, The sunne defac'd to lend the starre his light, The vine of life distilleth drops of grace, Our rocke giues issue to an heauenly spring, Teares from his eies, bloud runnes from wounded place Which showers to heauen of ioy a haruest bring, This sacred dew let angels gather vp, Such dainty drops best fit their nectared cup, With weeping eies his mother rewd his smart, If bloud from him, teares came from her as fast, The knife that cut his flesh did pierce his heart, The paine that Iesus set did Mary taste, His life and hers hung by one fatall twist, No blow that hit the sonne the mother mist. The Epiphanie. To blaze the rising of this glorious sunne A glittering starre appeareth in the East,’ Whose sight to pilgrims toile three sages wun; To seeke the light they long had in request, And by this starre to nobler starre they pace, Whose armes did their desired sinne imbrace: Stall was the skie wherein those plannets shinde, And want the clowd that did eclipse their raies, Yet through this clowd their light did passage finde, And pierc'd these sages hearts by secret waies, Which made them know the ruler of the skies, By infant tongue and lookes of babish eies, Heauen at her light, earth blusheth at her pride, And of their pompe these peeres ashamed be, Their crownes, their robes, their traines they set aside When Gods poore cottage, clouts, and crew they see, All glorious things their glory now despise Sith God Contempt doth more then Glory prise, Three gifts they bring, three gifts they beare away For incense, mirre, and gold; faith, hope, and loue, And with their gifts the giuers hearts do stay Their mind from Christ, no parting can remoue His humble state, his stall, his poore retinew They fancy more then all their rich reuenew. The Presentation. To be redeemde the worlds Redeemer brough, Two seely turtle doues for ransome paies, O wares with empires worthie to be bought, This easie rate doth sound, not drowne thy praise, For sith no prise can to thy worth amount, A doue, yea loue, due price thou doest account, Old Simeon, cheape pennie worth and sweete, Obteind when thee in armes he did imbrace, His weeping eies thy smiling lookes did meete, Thy loue his heart, thy kisses blest his face, O eies, O heart, meane sights and loues auoyde, Base not your selues, your best you haue enioyde, O virgine pure thou dost those doues present, As due to law, not as an equall price, To buy such ware thou wouldst thy selfe haue spent, The world to reach his worth could not suffice, If God were to be bought, not worldly pelfe, But thou wert fittest price next God himselfe. The flight into Egypt. Alas our day is forst to flie by night, Light without light, and sunne by silent shade, O nature blush, that suffrest such a wight, That in thy sunne thy darke eclipse hast made Day to his eies, light to his steps denie, That hates the light which graceth euery eie, Sunne being fled the starres do loose their light, And shining beames, in bloudy streames they drench. A cruell storme of Herods mortall spight, Their liues and lights with bloudy showres do quench, The tyrant to be sure of murdring one, For feare of sparing him doth pardon none. O blessed babes, first flowers of christian spring, Who though vntimely cropt faire garlandes frame, With open throats and silent mouthes you sing His praise, whom age permits you not to name, Your tunes are teares, your instruments are swordes, Your dittie death, and bloud in liew of wordes. Christs returne out of Egypt. When death and hell their right in Herod claime, Christ from exile returnes to natiue soile: There, with his life more deepely death to maime Then death did life by all the infants spoile. He shewed the parents that the babes did mone, That all their liues were lesse then his alone. But hearing Herods sonne to haue the crowne, The impious offspring of a bloudy sire, To Nazareth (of heauen beloued) towne, Flowre to a flowre he fitly doth retire. For he is a flower and in a flower he bred, And from a throne now to a flowre he fled. And wel deseru'd this flower his fruit to vew Where he inuested was in mortal weede, Where first into a tender bud he grew In virgin branch vnstaind with mortall seede. Young flower, with flowers, in flower well may he be: Ripe fruit he must with thornes hang on a tree. Christs bloody sweat. Fat soile, full spring, sweete oliue, grape of blisse, That yeelds, that streams, that powers, that dost distil Vntild, vndrawne, vnstampt, vntoucht of presse, Deare fruit, cleare brookes, faire oyle, sweete wine at wil: Thus Christ vnforst, preuents in sheeding blood The whips, the thornes, the naile, the speare, and roode. He Pelicans, he Phenix fate doth proue, Whom flames consume when streames enforce to die, How burneth bloud, how bleedeth burning loue? Can one in flame, and streame both bathe and frie? How would hee ioine a Phenix fiery paines, In fainting Pelicans still bleeding vaines? Christs sleeping friends. When Christ with care &amp; pangs of death opprest From frighted flesh a bloody sweate did raine, And full of feare without repose or rest In agonie did watch and pray in vaine, Three sundrie times hee his disciples findes With heauy eies, but farre more heauy mindes, With milde rebuke he warned them to wake: Yet sleepe did still their drowsie sences hold: As when the sunne the brightest shew doth make, In darkest shroudes the night birdes them infolde, His foes did watch to worke their cruell spight, His drousie friendes slept in his hardest night, As Ionas iayled once from Iappaes shoare A boystrous tempest in the aire did broile, The waues did rage, the thundring heau'ns did roare, The stormes, the rocks, the lightnings threatned spoile, The ship was billowes game, and chaunces pray, Yet carelesse Ionas mute and slumbring lay: So now though Iudas like a blustring gust, Doe stirre the furious sea of Iewish ire, Though storming troopes in quarrels most vniust Against the barke of all our blisse conspire, Yet these disciples sleeping lie secure, As though their wonted calme did still endure. So Ionas once his heauy limmes to rest, Did shrowd himselfe in iuy pleasant shade, But lo, while him a heauy sleepe opprest, His shadowy bowre, to withered stalke did fade, A cankered worme did gnaw the roote away, And brought the glorious branches to decay. O gratious plant, O tree of heauenly spring, The paragon for leafe, for fruit and flower, How sweete a shadow did thy branches bring To shrowd these soules that chose thee for their bower? But now while they with Ionas fall asleepe, To spoile their plant an enuious worme doth creepe. Awake you slumbring wights lift vp your eies, Marke Iudas how to teare your roote he striues, Alas the glorie of your arbor dies, Arise and guarde the comforte of your liues. No Ionas iuy, no Zacheus tree, Were to the world so great a losse as he. The virgin Mary to Christ on the Crosse. What mist hath dimd that glorious face, what seas of griefe my sun doth tosse? The golden raies of heauenly grace lies now ecclipsed on the crosse. Iesus my loue, my sonne, my God, behold thy mother washt in teares: Thy bloudie woundes be made a rod, to chasten these my latter yeares. You cruell Iewes come worke your ire, vpon this worthlesse flesh of mine: And kindle not eternall fire, by wounding him which is diuine. Thou messenger that didst impart, his first discent into my wombe, Come helpe me now to cleaue my heart, that there I may my sonne intombe. You Angels all that present were, to shew his birth with harmonie, Why are you not now readie here, to make a mourning symphony. The cause I know you waile alone and shed your teares in secresie, Least I should moued be to mone, by force of heauie companie. But waile my soule, thy comfort dies, my wofull wombe lament thy fruit, My heart giue teares vnto my eies, let sorrow string my heauy lute. A holy Hymne. Praise, O Sion, praise thy Sauiour, Praise thy Captaine, and thy pastour, With hymnes and solemne harmony. What power affords performe indeede, His workes all praises farre exceede: No praise can reach his dignity. A speciall theame of praise is read, A liuing and life giuing bread Is on this day exhibited Within the supper of our Lord, To twelue disciples at his bord, As doubtlesse twas deliuered. Let our praise be lou'd and free, Full of ioy and decent glee, With minds and voices melody. For now solemnize we that day, Which doth with ioy to vs display, The priuie vse of this mistery, At this bord of our new ruler, Of new law, new pascal order. The ancient rite abolisheth, Old decrees, by new annill'd, Shadowes are in truth fulfill'd, Day former darknesse finisheth, That at supper Christ performed To be done he straightly charged, For his eternall memorie. Guided by his sacred orders, Bread and wine vpon our altars To sauing host we sanctifie, Christians are by faith assured That to flesh the bread is changed, The wine to bloud most precious, That no wit nor sence conceiueth Firme and grounded faith belieueth In strange affects not curious. Vnder kindes two in appearance, Two in shew but one in substance, Be things beyond comparison: Flesh is meat, blood drinke most heauenly: Yet is Christ in each kinde wholy, Most free from all diuision. None that eateth him doth chew him, None that takes him, doth diuide him: Receiued, he whole perseuereth, Be there one or thousands housoled. One as much as all receiued, He by no eating perisheth. Both the good and bad receiue him, But effects are diuers in them, True life, or true destruction, Life to the good, death to the wicked: Marke how both alike receiued, With farre vnlike conclusion. When the priest the hoast deuideth, Know that each part abideth, All that the whole hoast couered: Forme of bread, not Christ is broken, Not of Christ, but of his token, Is state or stature altered. Angels bread made Pilgrims feeding, Truely bread for childrens eating, To dogs not to be offered: Sign'd by Isack on the altar, By the Lambe and pascall supper, And in the manna figured, Iesu foode and feeder of vs Here with mercie feede and friend vs, Then grant in heauen felicitie, Lord of all whom here thou feedest, Fellow heires, guests with thy dearest, Make vs in heauenly companie. S. Peters afflicted mind. If that the sicke may grone, Or Orphane mourne his losse: If wounded wretch may rue his harmes, Or caitife shew his crosse: If heart consumde with care, May vtter signes of paine, Then may my breast be sorrowes home, And tongue with cause complaine. My maladie is sinne, And langour of the mind, My body but a lazars couch, Wherein my soule is pinde. The care of heauenly kind Is dead to my releefe, Forlorne and left like Orphan childe; With sighes I feede my griefe. My wounds with mortall smart, My dying soule torment, And prisoner to mine owne mishaps, My follies I repent. My heart is but the haunt Where all dislikes do keepe: And who can blame so lost a wretch, Though teares of bloud he weepe? S. Peters remorse. Remorse vpbraids my faults, Selfe blaming conscience cries, Sinne claimes the hoast of humbled thoughts, And streames of weeping eies. Let penance Lord preuaile, Let sorrow sue release, Let loue be vmpier in my cause, And passe the doome of peace. If doome go by desert, My least desert is death That robs from soule immortall ioyes, From body mortall breath. But in so high a God, So base a wormes annoy, Can adde no praise vnto thy power, No blisse vnto thy ioy. Well may I frie in flames Due fuell to hell fire, But on a wretch to wreake thy wrath Can not be worth thine ire. Yet sith so vile a woorme Hath wrought his greatest spight, Of highest treason well thou maist, In rigor him indite. But mercy may relent And temper iustice rod, For mercy doth as much belong, As Iustice to a God. If former time or place More right to mercy winne, Thou first wert author of my selfe, Then vmpier of my sinne. Did mercy spin the thread, To weaue in iustice loome, Wert thou a father to conclude, With dreadfull Iudges doome, It is a small releefe To say I was thy child, If as an ill deseruing foe From grace I am exilde. I was, I had, I could, All wordes importing want: They are but dust of dead supplies, Where needefull helpes are scant. Once to haue beene in blisse That hardly can returne, Doth but bewray from whence I fell, And wherefore now I mourne. All thoughts of passed hopes Encrease my present crosse: Like ruines of decayed ioyes, They still vpbraide my losse, O milde and mighty Lord, Amend that is amisse: My sinne my soare, thy loue my salue, Thy cure my comfort is. Confirme thy former deedes, Reforme that is defilde: I was, I am, I will remaine, Thy charge, thy choise, thy childe. Man to the wound in Christs side. O pleasant port, O place of rest, O royal rift, O worthy wound, Come harbour me a weary guest, That in the world no ease haue found. I lie lamenting at thy gate, Yet dare I not aduenture in: I beare with me a troublous mate, And cumbred am with heape of sinne, Discharge me of this heauy loade, That easier passage I may find, Within this bowre to make aboade, And in this glorious toomb be shrin'd. Here must I liue, here must I die, Here would Tutter all my griefe: Here would I all those paines descrie, Which here did meete for my releefe. Here would I view that bloudy sore, Which dint of spiteful speare did breed: The bloudy woundes laid there in store Would force a stony heart to bleede. Here is the spring of trickling teares, The mirror of all mourning wights, With dolefull tunes, for dumpish cares, And solemne shewes for sorrowed sights. O happie soule that flies so hie, As to attaine this sacred caue: Lord send we wings that I may flie, And in this harbour quiet haue. Vpon the Image of death. Before my face the picture hangs, That daily should put me in mind, Of those cold names and bitter pangs, That shortly I am like to find: But yet alas full little I Do thinke here on that I must die. I often looke vpon a face Most vgly, grisly, bare and thinne, I often view the hollow place, Where eies and nose, had sometimes bin, I see the bones acrosse that lie: Yet little thinke that I must die. I reade the Labell vnderneath That telleth me where to I must, I see the sentence eake that saith, Remember man that thou art dust: But yet alas but seldome I, Doe thinke indeede that I must die. Continually at my beds head, A hearse doth hang which doth me tel, That I ere morning may be dead, Though now I feele my selfe ful well: But yet alas, for all this I Haue little minde that I must die. The gowne which I do vse to weare, The knife wherewith I cut my meate, And eke that old and ancient chaire, Which is my onely vsuall seate: All those do tel me I must die, And yet my life amend not I. My ancestors are turnd to clay, And many of my mates are gone, My yongers daily drop away, And can I thinke to scape alone? No, no, I know that I must die, And yet my life amend not I. Not Salomon for al his wit, Nor Samson though he were so strong, No king nor person euer yet Could scape, but death laid him along: Wherefore I know that I must die, And yet my life amend not I. Though all the East did quake to heare, Of Alexanders dreadfull name, And all the West did likewise feare, To heare of Iulius Cæsars fame, Yet both by death in dust now lie, Who then can scape but he must die? If none can scape deaths dreadfull dart, If rich and poore his becke obey, If strong, if wise, if all do smart, Then I to scape shall haue no way. Oh grant me grace O God that I, My life may mend sith I must die. A vale of teares. A vale there is enwrapt with dreadfull shades, Which thicke of mourning pines shrouds from the sunne Where hanging clifts yeld short &amp; dumpish glades, And snowy flouds with broken streames do runne, Where eie-roume is from rocke to cloudie skie, From thence to dales which stormy ruines shrowd, Then to the crushed waters frothie frie, Which tumbleth from the tops where snow is thow'd: Where eares of other sound can haue no choice, But various blustring of the stubborne wind, In trees, in caues, in straits with diuers noise, Which now doth hisle, now howle, now roare by kind: Where waters wrastle with encountering stones, That breake their streames, and turne them into foame, The hollow clowds ful fraught with thundering groans With hideous thumps discharge their pregnant wombe. And in the horror of this fearefull quier, Consists the musicke of this dolefull place: All pleasant birds their tunes from thence retire, Where none but heauy notes haue any grace. Resort there is of none but pilgrim wights, That passe with trembling foote and panting heart, With terrour cast in cold and shuddring frights, And all the place to terror framde by art: Yet natures worke it is of arte vntoucht, So strait indeede, so vast vnto the eie, With such disordred order strangely coucht, And so with pleasing horror low and hie, That who it viewes must needes remaine agast, Much at the worke, more at the makers might, And muse how Nature such a plot could cast, Where nothing seemed wrong, yet nothing right: A place for mated mindes, an onely bower, Where euerie thing doth sooth a dumpish mood. Earth lies forlorne, the cloudie skie doth lower, The wind here weepes, her sighes, her cries aloude: The strugling floud betweene the marble grones, Then roaring beates vpon the craggie sides, A little off a midst the pibble stones, With bubling streams a purling noise it glides. The pines thicke set, hie growne, and euer greene, Still cloath the place with shade and mourning vaile. Here gaping cliffes, there mosse growne plaine is seene, Here hope doth spring, and there againe doth quaile. Huge massie stones that hang by tickle stay, Still threaten foule, and seeme to hang in feare, Some withered trees ashamde of their decay, Beset with greene, and forcde gray cotes to weare. Here christall springs crept out of secret vaine, Straite findes some enuious hole that hides their graine Here seated tufts lament the wants of grace, There thunder wracke giues terror to the place. All pangs and heauie passions here may find A thousand motiues suitly to their griefes, To feede the sorowes of their troubled mind, And chase away dame pleasures vaine releefes. To plaining thoughts this vaile a rest may bee, To which from worldly toyes they may retire, Where sorrow springs from water, stone, and tree, Where euerie thing with mourners doth conspire. Sit here my soule, mourne streames of teares afloate, Here all thy sinfull foyles alone recount, Of solemne tunes make thou the dolefulst note, That to thy ditties dolor may amount. When Eccho doth repeate thy painefull cries, Thinke that the verie stones thy sinnes bewray, And now accuse thee with their sad replies, As heauen and earth shall in the latter day, Let former faults be fuell of the fire, For griefe in Limbecke of thy heart to still. Thy pensiue thoughts, and dumps of thy desire, And vapour teares vp to thy eies at will. Let teares to tunes, and paines to plaints be prest, And let this be the burthen to thy song, Come deepe remorse, possesse my sinfull brest: Delights adue, I harbored you too long. The prodigall childs soule wracke. Disankerd from a blisfull shore, and lancht into the meane of cares, Grown rich in vice, in vertue poore, from freedom falne in fatal snares, I found my selfe on euerie side enwrapped in the waues of wo, And tossed with a toilesome tide, could to no port for refuge go. The wrastling windes with raging blasts still hold me in a cruell chace: They breake my anchors, saue, and masts permitting no reposing place. The boistrous seas with swelling flouds, on euery side did worke their spight, Heauen ouercast with stormie clouds, denide the Planets guiding light. The hellish furies lay in wait, to winne my soule into their power, To make me bite at euery bast, wherein my bane I might deuoure. Thus heauen and hell, thus sea and land, thus stormes and tempests did conspire, With iust reuenge of scourging hand, to witnesse Gods deserued ire. I plunged in this heauie plight found in my faults iust cause to feare: My darkenes taught to know my light, the losse thereof enforced teares. I felt my inward bleeding sores my festred wounds began to smart, Stept far within deaths fatall doores, the pangs thereof were nere my hart. I cried truce: I craued peace, a league with death I would conclude, But vaine it was to sue release, subdue I must or be subdude. Death &amp; deceit had pitcht their snares and put their wonted proofes in vre To sinke me in despairing cares, or make me stoupe to pleasures bare: They sought by their bewitching charmes, so to enchant my erring sense, That when they sought my greatest harmes, I might neglect my best defence. My dazled eies could take no view, no heed of their receiuing shifts, So often did they alter hew, and practise new deuised drifts: With Syrens songs they fed mine eares, till luld asleepe on errors lap, I found their tunes turnd into tears, and short delights to long mishap. For I inticed to their lore, and soothed with their idle toies, Was trained to their prison doore the end of all such flying ioies: Where chaind in sinne I lay in thrall, next to the dungeon of despaire, Till mercy raisde me from my fall, and grace my ruines did repaire. Mans ciuill warre. My houering thoughts would flie to heauen, and quiet nestle in the skie, Faine would my ship in vertues shore without remoue at anchor lie: But mounted thoughts are hailed downe with heauie poise of mortall load, And blustring stormes denie my ship in vertues hauen sure aboade. When inward eie to heauenly sights doth draw my longing harts desire, The world with lesses of delight, would to her pearch my thoughts retire, Fond fancie traines to pleasures lure, though reason stiffely do repine. Though reason wooe me to the saint, yet sense would win me to the shrine: Where wisedome loathes, there fancie loues, and euer rules the captiue will Foes senses, and to vertues lore, they draw the wit their wish to fill. Neede craues consent of soule to sense, yet diuers bents breeds ciuill fray, Hard hap where halues must disagree, or trust of halues the whole betray. O cruell fight where fighting frend with loue doth kill a fauoring foe, Where peace with sense is warre with God, and selfe delight the seed of woe, Dame pleasures drugges are steept in sinne, their sugred taste doth breede anoy, O fickle sense beware her ginne, sell not thy soule for brittle ioy. Seeke flowers of heauen. Soare vp my soule vnto thy rest, cast off this loathsome loade, Long is the date of thy exile, too long the strickt abode. Graze not on worldly withered weede, it fittetth not thy taste, The flowers of euerlasting spring, doe grow for thy repast. Their leaues are staind in beauties die and blazed with their beams Their stalks enameld with delight, and limbde with glorious gleams, Life giuing iuice of liuing loue, their sugred veines doth fill, And watred with eternall showers, they nectared drops distill. These flowers do spring from fertile soile, though from vnmanurde field, Most glittring gold in lieu of globe, these fragrant flowers do yeeld: Whose soueraigne sent surpassing sense, so rauisheth the minde. That worldly weedes needs must he loath that can these flowers find. FINIS.</field>
