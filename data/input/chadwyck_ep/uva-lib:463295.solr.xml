      <field name="fulltext">To the worshipfull, his verie louing Cowsen M. Edwarde Eliotte Esquier, the Queenes Maiesties Surueyour of all her Honours Manours, Landes and possessions within her highnes County of Essex. The Authours minde vpon the matter of this his litle Booke. A publicque peace our highe Iehoue hath wrought: A priuate warre, with hate tweene man and man Doth Sathan breede. Good state, but life right nought: Alas alas, what wretches are we than? A Vineyard fenst, well fenced from decay, A State preseru'd, but people frowarde ay. Ah most vnkinde that neuer wyll obay. Thorowe me doe Kinges reigne: thorowe mee, Counsaylours make iust lawes: thorowe mee do Princes beare rule, and all the Iudges of the earth execute iudgement. Prou. 8. b Deut. 17. a Because of sinne the lande doth oft chaunge her Prince. But through men of vnderstandinge and wisedome a Realme endureth longe. Prou. 28. a. Leuit. 26. e. Where the Prince is without vnderstanding, there is great oppression and wronge. But if he be such a one as hateth couetousnes, he shal longe raigne. Prou. 28. c. A Commemoration of the most prosperous and peaceable Reigne of our gratious and deere Soueraygne Lady Elizabeth, by the grace of God, of England, Fraunce and Ireland Queene &amp; c. Iehoua, with our ioyned hands, and hartes replete with ioye, Wee prayse thee for our noble Queene, the shield of our annoye. Not wee, not wee (oh greate Iehoue) not wee, but thy right hande Hath wrought this calme and quiet state, in this our English lande. Great Bulles of Basan roare abroad, great curse from Balac commes, Eache Foreyn eare is fild with fight and sownde of fearfull droommes. Woe, woe, waymenting woes and feare through forein Soyle doth raunge: No Coast so clere where face of warre ne makes the cruell chaunge. Blood, blood is shed in monstrous wise: each forein State doth iarre, And open Murthers wanting Law, in forein Countreies are. Fowle fraude &amp; faithlesse fawning wordes in forein Coastes do dwell: High Seates of sway in forein Soyles of fraude and falshod smell. Men, Beastes, &amp; fieldes, lawes, loue &amp; truth there fall from former states: Each thing, each Sexe vncertaine standes and honest order hates. No course kept right, no seasons knowne, nought there, in sauety lyes. Each good growth yl, each yll growth worse each worse to worste doth rise. There, Soyles lie sackt, there, Mountaines quake there loftie Hilles downe sway: There, pleasant plots yeelde filthy weede, where Fragrant odoures lay. The plowed Fields, are there layde waste there, fertile grounds lye baard Eache Meadow there, lieth cleane defaste, no plotte of pleasure spaard: No lofty Pallace stands vpright, no place where vertue dwelt, Standth there so sownd which of the dinte of Battaile hath not felt. No Seate in sauety, nothing helps: no dewe Regarde preuailes: No right of cause there frees from force: no Sexe of sorrow fayles. Each noble face ly'th there forlorne, each mighty head brought lowe: Each valeaunt visage sprente with bloude there, through the Streates they throw. No law relieues: no iustice helpes, no truthe from daunger frees: None there, that liues in godly feare, true hope of sauetie sees. The aged man there drowpth in woe, the younge and lustie Rowte Are there sent foorth to leade their life in pyllage round aboute. The armed Knights with treasons trapt, the Sages of the land, In suspense lodge to liue or die: thus each ones case doth stand. There, wronged wights with sil?ce smart and there, th' opprest want ayde There, Lawes wherby the iust shuld liue, doe make the iuste afrayde. There dwelles no sounde of sacred songes that sweetely sende forth health: But there, both dowle and double plaints waymenting sorowes telth. No Fountaine there stands free from filth: no christall Spring runnes cleare: In steede of streaming Flouds of life, deepe dampes of Death are there. And whilst these woes do wander thus, as forein coastes haue tride, Thine english People, Lord, dwell safe: with them doth peace abide. With them doth liue a louing Queene who like a Mother raignes, And like a chosen sacred Impe immortall glory gaines. Her handes shee holdes not foorth to warre, her hart doth rest in peace: Shee Ioyes to see her peoples wealth and wayles their harmes increase. Thy gospelles sownde shee sendes abroade: shee stoppes no wholsome Spring: But popishe Puddles dammes shee vp which noysome humours bring. A Prince of price, most worthy prayse for thee and in thy name Of all that euer Scepter bare, of all that euer came From Englishe loynes to royall Seate: I say, none worthy more Amongst the race of Englishe kings that euer Scepter bore. I would conteine my feruent Muse, Ah Iemme, thy name denyes. My prayse nor all the Poetes pennes thy merite can suffise. And highest kinge that Welkin weeldst if hence thy glory come, That of a virgin Queene whom thou hast set in sacred Roome, Thy peoples peace should be sustainde, thy Gospell should be spred, Why should my burning Muse lye still? why should my penne lye dead? Is hand of fleshe her firmest force? is frowning face her swaye? Doth subtile drifts drawe forth her peace, or vaunting glory? Nay: Of Fleshe, the feeblest Sexe by kinde: of face not Iunoes feere: But mylde Susanna in her lookes and Hester in her cheere. The worke is thine, tis thine Iehoue: no iote begonne by man: Thou fram'dst her onely for thy praise: by thee her dayes began: All onely thou Iehoua, thou hast wrought her for thy praise: All onely thou hast made her deedes a wonder to our daies. From thee therfore, what so shee hath, from thee her vertues came, And her wee praise as gifte of thine and glory to thy name. So planted is her souereigne Seate, so fixed is her Throne, That thicke and threefold wronged wights there lay abroade their mone. Truth, mercy, peace, and loue possesse her Chayre of royall State: No Subiect Soule complaining griefe, goes helplesse from her gate. And what shee Rules, by loue shee Rules. No Force, where loue may winne. First friendly warnings-sendes shee forth Eare smarting Lawes beginne. Her Subiectes bloud shee seekes to saue as Apple of her eye: They lyne and shall, saue such as law and Iustice bids to dye. They liue and Ioye, her Foes and all, full many kept from Death: No ease to her, but griefe of minde, is losse of Subiectes breath. Her Subiects goodes shee neuer seekes: none lyues whom shee hath spoyld Her very Foes are free from force: no Foe with force is foyld. Yea foes and all, they sow and reape: they plant and eate the fruit, They build and buye, no losse they take vnlesse by lawfull suite. Each wight within her royall Realme possesseth as his owne, Such substaunce as by lotte he hath and vnto him is growne. With quiet course in equall sorte, each man in his degree, Draw'th forth his daies and spend'th his time full orderly to see. Wrong resteth no mannes right by might wher Princes ayde is crau'de: The poore with ritche contend a like: by Law their Rights bee sau'de. No Law lockt vp, no Iustice stopt, no one through her takes wrong. O noble Prince, and hast thou liu'de a vertuous Queene so longe? And hath thy name Elyzabeth, so many yeares sustainde The cause of Trueth, and runne that race that vertue hath ordeinde? Now, blessed be those daies of thine: Thrise blessed be our God, By whom our Queene Elyzabeth those vertuous steppes hath trod. Not force of Fleshe hath held her vp, not sharpe deuise of man, Not crafte, not skill, not worldly shifte her blessed state beganne. Before her raigne, bereaft of peace, bereaft of outwarde Ioy: Pursude to death by Romishe beastes still seeking her annoy: Whose foamy frothye murthrous Iawes, with stomackes stuft with guile Each day deuisde her graces death and sacred state to foyle. Whome high Iehoue preserued hath in spite of Sathans rage, To liue a Queene in blessed peace: to lyue an happye age. Oh, graunt her God, an hart to prayse and magnifie thy name: And as thou hast preseru'de her life, so still preserue the same. Let dewe remembraunce neuer slippe from forth her royall brest, But let her alwayes beare in minde how thou hast wrought her rest. 17. Nouemb. an. 18. Elizabeth R. Full seauenteene yeares this day her grace hath raign'de with vs a Queene: No Treasons force hath yet preuaild, that euer could be seene. No drift, deuise, no deuils deede, no falshod fetchte from hell Hath yet tane place: in sauetie yet her noble grace doth dwell. Thyne hand Iehoue hath founde them out, thine owne right hand hath broughte Each darke deuise to open viewe and treasons guile to nought. Thine hand hath held her kingdome faste: thine owne right hand hath stayde The running rage of rancour bent, and made her foes afrayde. Of wisdome hast thou lent her stoare to guide thy folcke aright: What giftes of grace haue Princes more obtayned in thy sight? Graue counsaile guiding all by Truth thou Lorde, with her hast plaste Whose careful works for common wealth can neuer be defaste. Whose mindes to rigoure they ne bende: no hartes they haue to harme: No woe they worke to any wight: to none they cry Alarme. No lawe they wrest to worke their willes no sleightes they doe impose, No burthen on her Subiectes backes obtruded is by those. They enuy not her peoples good: no trappes they laye to traine Nor subtile baytes by pinching lawes at any time ordeyne. Their Princes wrath they whet not on: no wayte they lay for blood. Oh noble wightes, and haue you liu'de to worke your Countreyes good? Haue all your Foes fownde endlesse bale that sought your honors spoyle? And stande you yet in Countreys sight, to seeke fowle Treasons foyle? With teares we hold our hands to heauen, and from our hartes we crie Lyue, liue you noble Counsayllers, liue liue and neuer dye. Let Princes loue remayne on you, and loue you her againe. So shall no treasons drifte disioynte our englishe peace in twaine. So shall you gaine a guerdon iuste for your so noble deedes, And so shall wee poore Subiecte sortes still sticke to you at needes. Lorde, blessed be thy name alwaies, thrise blessed by thy name, That guyd'st to good their graue attemptes dyrecting still the same. These giftes for thine we doo proclame euen all these giftes for thine, A gratious Queene with Counsayle graue: that to thy will encline: A noble race of royall wittes a Senate surely knit, A prudent sort of polishte heads who neuer (haplesse) yet Attempted ought that might redownd to wealth of Englishe soyle Who neuer yet emprised ought wherein they tooke the foyle. By thee wee still enioy her grace: by thee this Counsayle so: By thee the same doe plant good lawes all vice to ouerthrow. And for those lawes such Iudges set as Iustice well maintayne, Such Iudges, some, as doubtlesse yet no former times could gayne: Not moody sorte of wandring heades not hartes corrupt with guyle, Not wrangling wittes, not bribinge hands our Iudgementes Seates defile. But seemely sortes of sacred heads but Sages sownde and graue, But goodly viewe of learned wittes our Iudgement places haue. Where, looke what Lawe and Iustice wil, that Iudges doo pronounce: Where, looke what lawe and Iustice nill, that, Iudges doo renounce. Where, hee (my Lorde) amongs the rest, whose handes regard no meede, Whose harte Dyes no deceyte at all, with honour doth proceede (As others eke) in soundest sort to Ioyne together aye, With Mercy, Truth: with Iustice, Peace: in firme and perfecte staye. Ah hawtie Hall with honours deckt, ah Roofes of royall viewe, Ah Seates possest with Iustice self, with peace and Iudgements trewe. Sith laude, sith thankes, sith endlesse praise be dewe vnto thy name: Sweet lord, sweet Christ, for these thy gifts we magnifie the same. Lord, blesse therfore these benefittes, Lord, giue them large increase, Lord, let thy mercies still endure, Lord, let them neuer cease. Lord, blesse our Queene, Lord prosper her, Lord, leade her with thine hand: Lord teach her aye thy will to know and worde to vnderstand. Lord, graunt that shee in harte maye loue thy law and thy decree: That shee may knowe how all these giftes proceede good Lord from thee. And for thy works of wonder done, let her extoll thy praise: Let her in truth and holy lyfe continewe all her dayes. Let (Lorde) her graces eyes so pearce into thy Churches state, That she with Iudgement sound and pure remooue from thence debate. And let her (Lorde) so loue to heare thy godly Preachers voyce, That shee reiecte not what they teache, but take the best in choyse. Let pompous state be vnto her no stoppe of dew regarde, Ne let the faults of faythlesse mates, at any time be sparde. Let all her royall howsholde so reformed be from sinne, That they to all the worlde may showe what vertue is therein. That shee may bring a lasting praise and glory to thy name: That life and doctrine fownde alike, her foes may suffer shame. Lorde giue her Iudgement to discerne, and that with Counsayle graue Shee may finde out what sownde redresse our common wealth should haue. To cut of crafte from wholsome lawes: and (chiefly) to supplant From place of Rule and Iustice, such as sownde profession want. Whose handes how hurtfull they shall be in times of troublous state Our sondry sortes of troublous heades expressed haue of late. Lorde, graunt therefore that Lawes be had to bynde each place to choose To office, such as loue thy worde, and others to refuse. That whensoeuer forein driftes or home deuise shall rise, Such men of trust prepared so, may treasons guile surprise. Lorde, finally, with humbled mindes, and Sowles we thee desire Unite both Prince and Peoples harts with loue and zeale entire. That th' one with vpright course may rule. the other so obaye, As Prince may be her peoples Ioye, and people Princes staye. Lorde graunt that none within this Lande no one that beareth breath. Refuse in harte to crie God saue Our Queene Elizabeth. Amen. The Authour most humblie to all the Queenes highnes most honourable Counsaylers. Though Poets pennes in these our later daies In works of waite gaine credit neare a deale, Because that some seduced many waies, Their fond affectes and fancies do reueale In rymyng frames, wherein they do conceale No want of wyt, nor learning dew regarde, As in their Bookes full many haue declarde: Yet hope I must that truth may take no harme Where she is cloathd with cloake of simple Ryme Deuoyd of dark deuise and Poets charme: Which learned wits full rifelye in our time Haue set to view as sootest hearbes in Prime, Although the blunt and bitter byting brayne, Each rymed truth doth blot with black disdayne. You noble wights that win immortall fame By gyding well our english common wealth, To you I wryte, as one that loues the same And ioyes in heart to see your Honours health: Reiect him not that riming fancies telth: But beare him out where he deserues no blame, And heere such termes as he in truth shall name. Your godly, graue, and prouident foresightes These passed times and blisfull daies forespent Haue so preferd in peace vnto your mightes, That calmer daies of yoare were neuer lent. Your God therfor that so your harts hath bent, Extolle with praise, and watch to worke his wyll: Seeke tresons foyle and loue your countrey still. Beware of forrein fraude and false pretensed loue: Accept goodwill, but secreat woorks preuent: So ioy in league, that close compacts you proue: So liue in peace, as you to warre were bent. Yeeld trust, but try, for feare ye do repent. Geue heede to peace, but lyue not vnpreparde. The strongest state the longest time is sparde. And as you watch, each one in your degree, T'establish peace, and plant right wholsome lawes, So, noble wights, (as you true noble be) Keepe men opprest from rage of ramping pawes. Pluck, pluck y? spoyle from foorth deuouring iawes And let not Crewes of cruell wasting wightes Thus prank in pride w? spoile of pore mens rights. To taxe the Trades that wickednes findes out, To touch the liues that lewdnesse hath begonne, To blase the pride y? runnes the Realme throughout To preach y? Spoyles y? priuate gaine hath wonne, To shew the shifts that poore men haue vndone, O noble wights, and honourable all, No pen of mine hath force or euer shall. Men craue, you graunt: men pray, you pardon stil: Men sweare, you trust: men crouche, you think them mylde: Ah, out alas heerein is errour styll: Heerein your godly meanings are begilde. Herein the wastful Crewes &amp; lusty heads wax wyld Heerein the trades that wickednesse doth breed On Common welth with priuate pawnche do feed. Heerein the pompe of Pride withouten end, Hath put it selfe in prease, and vaunting spreddes With daring face, where none should dare offende: No Cæsars looke nor Princes eye it dreddes: In frank outrage alas it trampling treddes Heerein, the rowtes of cutting roysters grow, And bankes of peace with braules do ouerflow. Heerein, the bloudy papistes do conspire, And begging broodes of bankrowts (in their kind) Do take the course to set our peace on fire, By fawnyng force a filthy fetch to finde, A few to raise with ryches yll assygnd, Though thousands thence doe reape their endlesse neede Whence, hate for loue in consequence doth breede. Heerein, (to fine) the fewest sorts do right: Heerein, the lawes that godlynes haue fixt, Heerein, the peace appearing in our sight, By pryuate heades with wickednes are mixt, And this our peace hath dangers drawne betwixt. Heerein, therefore to finde redresse with speede Shal make your names true noble still indeede, In most humble wise. Edward Hake.</field>
