      <field name="fulltext">Christmas Roses. White-faced Winter Roses, O'er the grave I plant you Where the dead reposes, That a soul may haunt you, And your ghostly whiteness In the Winter gloom, Seem some spirit-brightness Shining from the tomb! The Call. Hark! 'tis the rush of the horses, The crash of the galloping gun! The stars are out of their courses; The hour of Doom has begun. Leap from thy scabbard, O sword! Leap! 'Tis the Day of the Lord! Prate not of peace any longer, Laughter and idlesse and ease! Up, every man that is stronger! Leave but the priest on his knees! Quick, every hand to the hilt! Who striketh notâhis the guilt! Call not each man on his brother! Cry not to Heaven to save! Thou art the manânot anotherâ Thou, to off glove and out glaive! Fight, ye who ne'er fought before! Fight, ye old fighting-men more! Oh, but the thrill and the splendour! The sudden new knowledgeâI can! To fawn on no hireling defender, But fight one's own fight as a man! On woman's love won we set store; To win one's own manhood is more. Who hath a soul that will glow not, Set face to face with the foe? âIs life worth living?â I know not; Death is worth dying, I know. Aye, I would gamble with Hell, Andâlosing such stakesâsay, 'Tis well! âAll's Well.â Watchman, watchman, what of the night, What of the night to tell? The heavens are dark, and never a light But the far-off flicker of Hell. But the steed is in the stall, Unsleeping; And the warder on the wall, Watch-keeping; And the granary is stored, And ready gun and sword. In the name of the Lord, All's well! Watchman, watchman, what of the night, What of the night to tell? The wind blows fierce, and the foam flies white, And the waters moan and swell. But the foes to haven keep, Safe hiding; And our ships are on the deep, Sure riding; And the gallant hearts on board Keep ceaseless watch and ward. In the name of the Lord, All's well! Watchman, watchman, what of the night, What of the night to tell? There are widows weeping, and babes affright, And a ceaseless burial bell. But the hand that holds the gun Still shakes not; And the line drops one by one, Yet breaks not. Of the blood so nobly poured There shall surely be reward. In the name of the Lord, All's well! False Gods. Gods of Berserker and Viking, Thor and Odin, rise again; Loki laughs to see the Red Cock crowing from the cross-topped fane. Steely-crested waves of battle, breaking in a crimson foam, Drench with blood the smiling cornland, drown in tears the happy home. Where is resting-place or refuge from the fear that compasseth, When the heavens drop destruction, and the seas are sown with death? For the sons of Light are fallen, fall'n thro' pride, as angels fell; And the Morning-star becometh Lucifer, the Prince of Hell. To the false gods of thy fathers bend in vain thy recreant knee! They who smote Napoleon's eagles will not flinch for thine or thee! Now of forty years of iron, Europe sees thro' tears the end: As a foe we fear no longer, though we feared thee as a friend. Often have we half believed thee, fain to grasp the grisly hand, Steel-enwrapped, that hid Death's fingersâtrust the mask-face smiling bland. Fallen is that mask for everâfull revealed the felon head, And the proud-winged Prussian eagle prov'n a vulture, carrion-fed. As the day of Armageddon deadly shall the conflict be. Flesh is clothingâbreath is quickeningâthe dry bones of chivalry. Arthur rides again to battle; there is Galahad the pure; Loyal Lancelot, gallant Gawain, fight with us: the End is sure. Sure the victory. Else how vain-imagined are millennial yearsâ Love victoriousâTruth triumphantâceased the flow of helpless tears! Sure the End is. Else Eternal Love must come again to die; Peter shall forswear, and Judas kiss, and Pilate crucify. The Song of the Guns. Thunder of cannon and shrieking of shell! Gallop, ye gunners! the bugle is calling. Yon post is to reach, 'tho' 'tis portal of Hell. Gallop, ye gunners! your comrades are falling. Striving of horses and straining of wheels! Gallop, ye gunners! so near is disaster. The heaven is darkened, the earth rocks and reels. Gallop, ye gunners! for Death rideth faster. What is this shrilling and buzzing of bees? Gallop, ye gunners! the bullets are hailing. What is this rushing like wind in the trees? Gallop, ye gunners! fear nothing but failing! Hark, how they cheer in the trenches ahead! Gallop, ye gunners! their hands yet they wave them. See, yet they stand, 'mid the dying and dead! Gallop, ye gunners! unlimber and save them! The Debt Unpayable. What have I given, Bold sailor on the sea, In earth or heaven, That you should die for me? What can I give, O soldier, leal and brave, Long as I live, To pay the life you gave? What tithe or part Can I return to thee, O stricken heart, That thou shouldst break for me? Yon fiery breath For you has slain life's flowers; It withereth (God grant!) all weeds in ours. The Coming of the Oversea Armies. Ye who have died for England, o'er whose graves Move unfamiliar stars and alien waves, Rest now content! ye have not died in vain. This day beholds the guerdon of your pain; The cause victorious that ye died to win; The harvest of your sowing gathered in. For justice and for righteousness ye wrought Unflinching and unfailing, though ye fought Unholpen, and your own stout heart was all, The single fortalice to stand or fall; Though vain your life seemed, by false dreams deceived; Your death to annul the little work achieved. Oh, if some land of clearer light there be, From whose far hills this world ye yet may see; If there life single-purposed, past the break Of Death, still hold that purpose, nor forsake The fellowship of earth though far away: Assuaging gladness should be yours to-day, To know full-crowned the labours of your hand. This day all round the world your Motherland Sees all her children rise and call her blessed. This day with one voice have her sons confessed Before the nations that for no false gain Of gold or lands, no tyranny to attain For selfish purpose or luxurious ease, Has England held the empire of the seas, And flown her flag in every continent. Peace she ensued, on righteousness was bent, Freedom for all men, and an equal world For great or little. Therefore see unfurled To-day the banners of a thousand tribes, Hired not for lucre nor base-won by bribes, That rise uncalled respondent to her need, Her own free sons, and races she has freed Or kept in freedom! Listen! with one mouth From East and West they cry, from North and South: âWe are as thou art, and our sons as thine! Our arms, our wealth, our manhood we assign!â O lion-heart of England, tried and true! Leap at the messageâleap, and beat anew With fearless faith, and hope assured, and will Unfaltering, thy long labour to fulfil, Till every wave repeat and every wind: âPeace upon earth! goodwill to all mankind!â A Lamentation over Belgium. Oh, weep for the Land that is weeping for her dead! Who sits, a maid deflowered, with mourning-robes outspread, With the iron in her soul and the dust upon her head! Oh, weep for the Land, and the pleasant ways that were! Her cities were as flowers that adorn a rich parterre; She smiled as a maiden delighting to be fair. Alas, alas, her cities! They are falln or burnt with fire, Like flowers rent and ruined which men no more desire; Her face is marred with blood and her bosom foul with mire. Oh, weep for the Land, and her men that are no more! Oh, weep for the Land, and her widows weeping sore, And her children begging bread from door to alien door! She was nursed among the nations, a daughter fair to see, A little last-born darling, a nursling of the knee, The darling of the nations, free-born among the free. They stood, the war-girt nations, in arms around her then, And swore to defend her, a maiden among men; They swore an oath confederate, and confirmed it with the pen. Oh, shame upon the false head, that held not by his troth! Oh, shame upon the false hand, that signed and brake the oath! More shame upon the false lips that feigned the hand was loth! But woe for the Land, that sat in selfish ease, And stored plenteous garners, and played on pleasant leas, And mocked at the menace of storm across the seas! Oh, woe for the Land, that remembered not her word, Nor heeded darkening heavens or far-off thunder heard, Nor looked to her armour, nor kept her house prepared! âSufficient,â so she laughed, âis the evil to the day! When the foe is at the gate we can fight instead of play.â And remembered not her friends in forefront of the fray. âArise! 'tis the tempest! It is on us! Save us now!â We heard the cry of anguish and bethought us of our vow; And answered: âEngland's honour is England's soul, we trow. Fear not! we keep our promise; we make this war our own!â Alas, for the idle boast, the empty trumpet blown! Alas, for the plighted word redeemed in words alone! Alas, for the sword in the scabbard left to rust! Alas, for the spear not sharpened for the thrust! Alas, for the unready who in untried armour trust! What worth were oaths unbroken, when walls and cities brake? What mattered we forsook not, when these must all forsake? What profits England's waking? Can Belgium's dead awake? Was England's name upheld when the towers of Louvain fell? Was England's honour proved in the havoc of the shell? Was England's word made good in the hurricane of Hell? For they who brake that covenant delight in men of deed; And we who kept that covenant to men of words give heed; And the harvest is to all as the sowing of the seed. Oh, what shall be the ending? Can smitten Belgium rise, When the smoke of her burning ascendeth to the skies, And nought is left her children except their weeping eyes? Oh, what shall be the end to her? What comfort of her pain? Her cities, who will build them, her fields who plant again? And who will raise up sons to her heroic as her slain? Her fortune who may tell her? Our hands may turn indeed The blackened pages of the Past, but who the Future read? Save this: The blood of heroes of noble lives is seed. A hundred years have passed away since Waterloo was won. A hundred years shall pass again, and all our days be done For whom the dreadful hours now like drops of life-blood run. And when our children's children shall walk that blood-drenched soil, Where scarce is field to ravage or city left to spoil, And see the cattle grazing and townsfolk at their toil; Then shall they say of Belgium, in language soft with tears, âShe was a lesser star whom fire made bright above her peers, To be the shining lodestar by which all honour steers.â And Peace, at last set surely on guard around the girth Of this war-tortured planet in air and sea and earth, When numbering the nations, and weighing each his worth, Shall take with love most tender this wounded land to her, Ev'n as a mother doth the child of suffering prefer; And say before her prouder sons, nor find one gainsayer: âLo, she hath given more than all, this little one, to me! For they gave of their plenty, the wealth of land and sea; But she has given all she was, and all she hoped to be! Here: and There. September, 1914. Here. Soft benediction of September sun; Voices of children, laughing as they run; Green English lawns, bright flowers and butterflies And over all the blue embracing skies. There. Tumult and roaring of the incessant gun; Dead men and dying, trenches lost and won; Blood, mud, and havoc, bugles, shoutings, cries; And over all the blue embracing skies. Lord Roberts. Great, in a day of teeming littlenesses; Clear-visioned, in a day of clouds and gloom; Strong, in a day of weakness and distresses; In days of lightness, earnest as the Doom! Thy name all England and her Empire blesses, Whose sons shall make their Mecca of thy tomb.</field>
