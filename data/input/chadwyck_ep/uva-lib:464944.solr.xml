      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME the Second. A Soliloqui in HAMLET, Imitated. The attribution of this poem is questionable.To Marry or Live single! That's the Question! Whether 'tis happier, in the Mind to stifle, The Heats and Tumults, of outragious Love, Or with some prudent Fair in solemn Contract Of Matrimony joyn? To have and hold! No more! and in a trice to say we end. The Heart ake, and the Thousand love sick Pains; Which CÃ¦libacy yields! A Consumation: Devoutly to be wished. In Nuptial Bands To joyn till Death dissolve ay there's the Rub, For in that space what dull remorse may come, When we have taken our solemn leave of Liberty, Must give us pause. There's the respect That slacks our Speed in suing for a Change: For who wou'd bear the Scorn and Sneers which Batchelors When aged feel, the Pains and Fluttering fears Which each new Face gives to the Roving lover, When he at once, might rid himself of all By Marriage Knot? Who cou'd with patience bear To fret and Linger out a single Life, But that the Dread of something yet unseen, Some hazard in a State from whose strict Bonds Death only can release, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others which perhaps are greater; Thus Cool Reflection makes us Slow and Wary, Filling the dubious Mind with dreadfull Thoughts Of future Discords Jealousies and Costs Extravagantly great, entail'd on Wedlock: Which to avoid, the Lover cheeks his Passion, And rather dies a Batchelor. [The tragick muse full twice a thousand years] The attribution of this poem is questionable. The tragick muse full twice a thousand years, In lofty scenes has rais'd our hopes and fears; By unexpected turns she gives surprise, New joys she gives, then fils with tears our eyes; A war of passions in their breasts they feel As the muse fires, who have not hearts of Steel. Old Aschilus in tragick numbers bold, The griefs of mortals, and immortals, told; He leaving nature and terrestial plains, Sung Joves revenge, and bound a God in chains. Next Sophocles majestick in his rage, To admiration charms a knowing age; In all the pomp of words he greatly sings, The wreck of empires and the woes of Kings. Euripides sententious and serene, Bright tho' not blazing, grac'd the tragick scene; Proud Rome that gather'd of old greece their store, Compar'd with her, in tragedy was poor; In Nero's reign the moralizing sage Drew but faint lines of the Greecian page. To these succeeds a race of monkish days, In which no learned bard was crown'd with bays; One dismal cent'ry to another yeilds, No sound is heard but the loud clash of shields; Hums, Goths and Sandals, from the northern clime, Swarm on the Earth, and fright the land of rhime; Mute are the nine, virtue and learning sleep Whilst war and zeal their wakeful vigils keep. At length the tragick muse again appears, And gives the promise of successful years; Britain and France the sacred influence feel, From Shakespear, Fletcher, and the great Corneile. Their bright examples other bards inspire, And emulous of fame, their bosoms fire; In virtue's cause the sons of verse engage, And most instructing, most they charm the age. This night our bard the glorious tract persues, New to the Stage he courts the tragick muse; By an invented tale, a tale of love, Without the guilt of blood, he strives to move; To their own peace he shews the parents blind, Who disunite the hearts which love has join'd; With candour he intreats you to attend And hopes your favour, as he's virtues friend. June, 1731. To the Memory of Mat. Concanen, Esq; late Attorney General of Jamaica. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Friendship began in unexperienc'd Youth, In Honour founded, and secur'd by Truth, In distant Climes, and various Fortunes try'd, Not Death, the grand Destroyer, can divide: True to thine honest Fame, which long shall live, This last just Tribute, to thy worth I give. A Humour pleasing, and a Wit refin'd, Knowledge, and Judgment clear, enrich'd your Mind; In you, to full Perfection met the Pow'rs, Which sweeten, and adorn, the social Hours; In Fancy's flow'ry Gardens when you stray'd, If you invok'd the Muse, she gave her aid: Nor, covetous, nor negligent, of Fame, You've gain'd a fair, deserv'd a lasting Name. To The Right Rev. Benjamin Lord Bishop of Winchester, on his Collection of Sermons published in in the Year, 1754. The attribution of this poem is questionable.In early Days of Manhood you began, To prove yourself th'impartial Friend of Man; With reason arm'd, you broke the Tyrant's Rod, And shew'd that freedom's Foes were Foes to God: You from our civil Right expel'd the Storm, And drew Religion in an Angel's form: Gladly we see the same Pursuits engage, Thine active Soul in thy declining Age: Proceed, as you began, the Friend of Truth, The Comfort of the Old, and guide of Youth. In thy rewards contented shall thou rest, Bless'd in thy labours, in thine Offspring bless'd. Yet, farther yet, throw thy discerning Eye, And see thy Lot beneath a purer Sky; Where doubts no more the restless Mind employ, Where all is Health, and Harmony, and Joy. An ODE, to Son of Andrew Stone, Esq; Member of Parliament for Hasting in Sussex. Master Stone, not a Day old. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Happy Infant of a Day, Safe from ev'ry flatt'ring Lay, 'E're thou yet hast seen the Sky, Where thy latest Glorys lye, 'E're thou hast arriv'd at Noon, Take the Muse's early Boon. Millions unregarded pass, As beneath the Scythe the Grass, For of Millions, from their Birth, Few are little more than Earth. As thy future Days encrease, 'E're thou know'st the Stores of Greece, Or hast hear'd the Roman Lyre, All familiar to thy Sire, May'st thou lisp this faithful Lay, Which to thee and Truth I pay. Thro' thy young and sportive Hours, May'st thou bloom like vernal Flow'rs, Which no sudden Blights, or Storm, Ever shrivel or deform: Never may thy spritely Years, Fill thy Mother's Eyes with Tears; But may all thy joyful Days Win thy Father's Love and Praise: Then a Bard, as yet unborn, May thy Name and Worth adorn, While the Poet of thy Spring, Form'd by Nature now to sing, Sleeps with Worms beneath the Ground, And with Kings whom Death uncrown'd. To the Memory of the Right Hon. Henry Pelham, Esq The attribution of this poem is questionable.When Death at random throws his ebon Dart, He wounds a Friend's, perhaps a Lover's heart, This Day unweep'd a slothful Prelate fell, The Mitre fits another's Brow as well; Commons and Nobles undistinguish'd fall; And unconcern'd their Heirs succeed them all; But, when the Fury lays a Pelham low, A Nation weeps, a Nation feels the Blow. To the Right Honourable John Earl of Westmoreland, On his return from France, in the Year, 1752. The attribution of this poem is questionable.To foreign Climes, illustrious Fame, you roan, In search of Health you could not gain at Home; Yet, gen'rous man, thou no Relief could'st find For the Disorder of thy troubled Mind, Again return'd to thy lov'd native Shore, Let state afflictions rack thine Heart no more: Hail Patriot true! Long on the Kentish Plains, On thy Paternal Lands where Plenty reigns, With thy lov'd Consort may'st thou live, possess'd, Of the fair Cherub Health, compleatly bess'd. Like the great Censor in the Sabine Ground Enjoy thy Lot, in Quietude renown'd, While the just muse, true to thy virtuous Fame, Shall to thy Countrymen proclaim thy Name. An Answer to the above Letter.The preceeding letter has been omitted. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Dear Sylph, You always please me when you flatter, Tho' now you very idly chatter: I drop my Glove it's true, what then? Such things are private Hints to Men; And amongst other female Arts, We drop our Gloves, to pick up Hearts. Like Champions whom Poet's sing, I threw my Gauntlet, in the Ring: Nor can the Girl deserve rebuke, That Challenge, and gains a Duke. A POEM, on the Death of Edward Dawson, Esq; of Vaux-Hall, June 19, 1755. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Farewel departed and lamented shade, Whose work no song of flatt'ry shall degrade; I've known thy virtues long, and known them well; Which none can more esteem, or better tell. Malice, or envy, never broke thy rest; For honour always occupy'd thy breast: Thy friends were many, and thy foes were few; Only the foes of truth were foes to you. Some to the grave descend for arms renown'd, And have for conquests been with glory crown'd: On these the muse has long bestow'd her praise And with heroic worth adorn'd her lays, While the pacifick arts neglected lye, And milder virtues pass unheeded by, Like flow'rs which rise to deck the lonely glades, And fade unseen in unfrequented shades. Be mine the task thy praises to prolong To after ages in recording song, To give, as right decrees, thy fav'rite name To, what thro' life you shun'd, the voice of fame. Proud Venice long had triumph'd in her store Of treasure rising from her chrystal ore, Long from from her fiery cells the liquid mass Transparent flow'd, and harden'd into glass; Of all the nations round she got the start, Without a rival in the lucid art, Till noble George Villiers, the second Duke of Buckingham of that Name, founded the Plate-Glass-Houses at Vauxhall, and brought Artificers with him from Venice, the Manufactory of which was brought to Perfection by the late Mr. Edward Dawson. Villiers rose with projects fraught, And the grand alchymy to England brought; Which, to thy country's profit, now we see Improv'd, and to perfection brought by thee: The mirrour now to nature adds a grace, Gives back a lovelier form, and fairer face. As thro' the peaceful vale of life you trod, And daily there walk'd humbly with your god, The virgin Faith attendant at your side, And fair Benevolence your constant guide, Whene'er you met the painful sons of care, You from their bosoms drove the fiend despair, With salutary counsel sooth'd their grief, And to their wants extended due relief Oft have you clear'd the wrinkled brow of need, The naked cloth'd, and bad the hungry feed, Pleas'd unexpected blessings to dispense, While they who had them had, but knew not whence: So the parch'd Indian from the sultry plain, Where all the wither'd herbage thirsts for rain, Sees, as he travels thro' the tedious way, Where the smooth gliding winding currents stray; With eager eyes the friendly stream he views; And thro' his breast new joys themselves diffuse; With the refreshing draught he cures his pains, But stranger to the fountain-head remains. For truth, for honour, and for ev'ry worth, You was a constant advocate on earth, To ev'ry vice, to ev'ry breach of trust Severe, but never more severe than just: Had thine own son been from all virtues free. That son no more had found a sire in thee. Thro' all thy life thy fortitude of heart Could baffle pain and blunt the tyrant's dart: With the same firmness you resign'd your breath, In purer worlds to triumph over death. An ODE to the Right Honourable Sir John Ligonier, occasioned by the several Accounts in the public Papers of his Death. The attribution of this poem is questionable. I The carrion crow, that hovers o'er The armies on the blood-stain'd shore, The vilest of the feather'd race, Is like the scribling crew which run, From morning to the setting sun, Collecting praises and disgrace. II The virgin's triumphs in her bloom, Her early passage to the tomb, Or her lamented follies pass'd, Her pains, her transports, or her ease, Alike the servile wretches please, Whose breath is like the eastern blast. III On falshood or on truth they prey, The ministers of rumour they, Creeping in darkness and in light: Vermin like them none can be found, In water, air, or under ground, Detestable to human sight. IV Often the brazen lye they fling From the nocturnal raven's wing, Pointed with anguish and despair, Heedless whose gentle breast they rend: Nor lover they regard, nor friend, The brave, the virtuous, nor the fair. V E'en now, dear Ligonier, the dart Of rumour rancles in my heart, Which spread the tydings of thy fall: Still hangs the chrystal on my eye, Still in my bosom heaves a sigh, Obedient they to friendship's call. VI And is he gone my sorrows cry'd, In camps, in courts more dang'rous try'd? Then break the warlike spear in twain; Turn loose the gallant martial steed, To neigh thro' Cobham's flow'ry mead, For he'll a second lord disdain. VII These were the words of grief; but now With roses will I bind my brow, And offer at Minerva's shrine, (Who still her soldier's life regards With glory who his worth rewards,) The cheerful juices of the vine. BENEDICITEâ O all ye Works of God bless ye, &amp;c. I Ye works of God on him alone, (In earth his footstool, heav'n his throne) Be all your praise bestow'd; Whose hand the beauteous fabrick made, Whose eye the finish'd world survey'd, And saw that all was good. II Ye angels, who with loud acclaim Admiring view'd the new born frame, And hail'd th'eternal king, Again proclaim your maker's praise, Again your thankful voices raise, And touch the tuneful string. III Praise him ye bright etherial plains, Where in full majesty he deigns To fix his awful throne; Ye waters, that above them roll From orb to orb, from pole to pole, Oh! make his praises known. IV Thrones, dominations, virtues, powers, Oh! join your joyful songs with ours, With us your voices raise; From age to age extend the lay, To heav'ns eternal monarch pay Hymns of eternal praise. V CÃ¦lestial orb, whose pow'rful ray Opes the glad eye-lids of the day, Whose influence all things own, Praise him whose courts effulgent shine With light as far excelling thine, As thine the paler moon. VI Ye glitt'ring planets of the sky, Whose beams the absent sun supply, With him the song pursue; And let himself submissive own, He borrows from a brighter sun The light he lends to you. VII Ye show'rs and dews, whose moisture shed Calls into life the op'ning seed, To him your praises yield; Whose influence makes the genial birth, Drops fatness on the pregnant earth, And crowns the laughing field. VIII Ye winds that oft tempestuous sweep The ruffled surface of the deep, With us confess your God: See thro' the heav'ns the king of kings, Up-born on your extended wings, Comes flying all abroad. IX Ye floods of fire where e're ye flow, With just submission humbly bow, To his superior pow'r, Who stops the tempest on its way, Or bids the flaming deluge stray, And gives it strength to roar. X Ye summer's heat, and winter's cold, By turns in long succession roll'd, The drooping world to chear; Praise him who gave the sun and moon, To lead the various seasons on, And guide the circling year. XI Ye frosts that bind the wat'ry plain, Ye silent show'rs of fleecy rain, Peruse the heavenly theme; Praise him who sheds the driving snow, Forbids the harden'd wave to flow, And stops the rapid stream. XII Ye days and nights that swiftly born From morn to eve, from eve to morn, Alternate glide away; Praise him whose never varying light Absent adds horror to the night, But present gives the Day. XIII Light, from whose rays all beauty springs, Darkness, whose wide extended wings Involve the dusky globe; Praise him who when the heav'ns he spread Darkness his thick pavilion made, And light his regal robe. XIV Praise him ye lightnings as ye fly Wing'd with hot vengeance thro' the sky, And red with wrath divine, Praise him ye clouds, that wand'ring stray, Or, fix'd by him in close array, Surround his awful shrine. XV Exalt O earth thy heavenly king, Who bids the plants, that from the spring Renew their annual bloom; Whose frequent drops of kindly rain Prolifick swell the rip'ning grain, And bless thy fertile womb. XVI Ye mountains that ambitious rise, And lift your summits to the skies, Revere his awful nod; Think how ye once affrighted fled, While Jordan sought his fountain head, And own'd th'approaching God! XVII Ye trees that fills the rural scene, Ye flow'rs that o'er th'enamell'd green, In native beauty reign, Oh! praise the ruler of the skies, Whose hand the genial sap supplies, And cloathes the thankful plain. XVIII Ye secret springs, and gentle rills That murm'ring rise among the Hills, Or fill the humbler vale, Praise him at whose almighty nod The rugged rock dissolving flow'd, And form'd a springing well. XIX Praise him ye floods, and seas profound, Whose waves the spacious earth surround, And roll from shore to shore; Aw'd by his voice, ye seas subside, Ye floods within your channels glide, And tremble and adore. XX Ye whales that stir the boiling deep, Or in its dark recesses sleep Remote from human eye; Praise him by whom ye all are fed, Praise him without whose heav'nly aid Ye sicken, faint, and die. XXI Ye birds exalt your maker's name: Begin, and with th'important theme Your artless lays improve, Wake with your songs the rising day, Let musick sound from ev'ry spray, And fill the vocal grove XXII Praise him ye beasts that nightly roam Amid' the solitary gloom, Th'expected prey to seize; Ye slaves of the laborious plough, Your stubborn necks submissive bow And bend your wearied knees. XXIII Ye sons of men, his praise display, Who stamp'd his image on your clay, And gave it pow'r to move; Ye that on Judah's confines dwell, From age to age successive tell The wonders of his love. XXIV Let Levi's tribe the lay prolong, Till angels listen to the song, And bend attentive down; Let wonder seize the heav'nly train, Pleas'd while they hear a mortal strain, So sweet, so like their own. XXV And ye your thankful voices join, That oft have bow'd before his shrine, On Sion's sacred hill; Where erst th'effulgent glory stood, And utter'd from the mystick cloud, The dictates of his will. XXVI Ye Spirits of the just and good, That eager for the blest abode, To heav'nly mansions soar; Oh! let your songs his praise display, Till heav'n itself shall melt away, And time shall be no more XXVII Praise him, ye meek and humble train, Ye saints, whom his decrees ordain The boundless bliss to share; Oh! praise him till you take your way To regions of eternal day, And reign for ever there. XXVIII Let us who now impassive stand, Plac'd by the tyrant's stern command Amid' the fiery blaze; While thus we triumph in the flame, Rise, and our maker's love proclaim In hymns of endless praise. The End of the Second Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Genealogy of Christ, as it is painted on the East Window of the College Chapel at Winchester. The attribution of this poem is questionable. At once to raise our Rev'rence, and Delight To elevate the Mind, and please the Sight, To pour in Virtue at the attentive Eye, And waft the Soul on Wings of Extasie; For this the Painter's Art with Nature vies, And bids the visionary Saint arise. Who views the sacred Form in Thought aspires, Catches pure Zeal, and as he gazes fires; Feels the same Ardour to his Breast convey'd, Is, what he sees, and emulates the Shade. Thy Strokes, great Artist, so sublime appear, They check our Pleasure with an awful Fear: While thro' the mortal Line the God you trace, Author himself, and Heir of Jesse's Race; In Raptures we admire the bold Design, And as the Subject, own the Hand divine. While thro' thy Work the rising Day shall stream, So long shall last thy Honour, Praise, and Name; And may thy Labour to the Muse impart Some Emanation to its Sister Art, To animate the Verse, and bid it shine In Colours easy, strong, and bright as Thine. Supine on Earth an awful Figure lies, While softest Slumbers seem to seal his Eyes; The hoary Sire Heav'n's guardian Care demands, And at his Feet the watchful Angel stands: Here Amnon glories, proud, incestuous Lord; This Hand sustains the Robe, and that the Sword: Frowning, and Fierce, with haughty Steps he tow'rs, And on his horrid Brow Defiance low'rs. There Absalom the ravish'd Sceptre sways, And his stol'n Honour all his Shame displays; The base usurping Youth, who joins in one The rebel Subject, and ungrateful Son. Amid the royal Race see Nathan stand, Fervent he seems to speak, and lifts his Hand, His looks th'Emotion of his Soul disclose, And Eloquence from ev'ry Gesture flows. Such, and so stern he came ordain'd to bring The dreadful Mandate to the guilty King; When, at his dreadful Voice, a sudden Smart Shot thro' the trembling Monarch's conscious Heart, From his own Lips condemn'd, severe Decree! Had his God prov'd so stern a Judge as he: But Man to frailty is ally'd by Birth; Consummate Purity ne'er dwelt on Earth: Thro' all his Soul, tho' Virtue hold her reign, Beat at his Heart, and spring in ev'ry Vein; Yet ever from the clearest Source have ran Some gross Allay, some Tincture of the Man. But who is he deep musing in his Mind, Who seems to weigh in Reason's Scale Mankind? Fix'd Contemplation holds his steady Eyes: I know the Sage, the Wisest of the Wise; Blest with all Man cou'd wish, or Prince obtain, Yet his great Heart pronounce those Blessings vain. And lo! bright glitt'ring in his sacred Hands In miniature the glorious Temple stands. Effulgent Frame! stupendous to behold, Gold the strong Valves, the Roof of burnish'd Gold. The wandring Ark, in that bright Dome enshrin'd, Spreads the strong Light, eternal, unconfin'd; Above that venerable Glory plays, Presence divine! and the full streaming Rays Pour thro' reluctant Clouds intollerable Blaze. But stern Oppression rends Re'boam's Reign; See the gay Prince, injurious, proud, and vain: Th'imperial Sceptre totters in his Hand, And proud rebellion triumphs o'er the Land; Cur'st with Confusion's ever fruitful Spring A beardless Senate, and a haughty King. There Asa good, and great, the Sceptre bears; Justice attends his Peace, Success his Wars. While Virtue was his Sword, and Heav'n his Sheild, Without Controul the Warrior swept the Field: Loaded with Spoils, triumphant he return'd, And half her Swarthy Sons sad Ãthiopia mourn'd. But since thy flagging Piety's decay'd, And God's Defence exchang'd for human Aid, See those fair Laurels wither on thy Brow, Nor Herbs, nor healing Arts avail thee now. Nor is Heav'n chang'd, apostate Prince but thou, No mean Attonement does this Lapse require, But see the Son, you must forgive the Sire. He, the just Prince, with ev'ry Virtue blest, He reign'd, and Goodness all the Man possest. Around his Throne fair Happiness and Peace Smooth'd ev'ry Brow, and smil'd in ev'ry Face. As when along the burning Waste he stray'd Where no pure Stream in bubling Mazes play'd, Where Drought incumbent on the thirsty Ground, Long since had breath'd her scorching Blasts around, The Prophet calls; th'obedient Floods repair To the parch'd Fields; for Josaphat was there. The new sprung Waves in many a gurgling Vein Trickle luxurious thro' the sucking Plain: Fresh Honours the reviving Fields adorn, And o'er the Desert Plenty pours her Horn. So from his Throne his Influence he sheds, And bids the Virtues raise their languid Heads. Where're he goes attending Truth pervails, Oppression flies, and Justice lifts the Scales. See on his Arm the royal Eagle stand; Great Type of Conquest, and supreme Command: Th'exulting Bird distinguish'd Triumph brings, And greets the Monarch with expanded Wings: Fierce Moab's Sons prevent th'impending Blow, Rush on themselves, and fall without a Foe. The pious Heroe vanquish'd Heav'n by Pray'r His Faith an Army, and his Vows the War. Thee too Uriah Fate indulgent blest, And thy Days shone in brightest Action drest, Till that rash Hand by some blind Frenzy sway'd, Unclean the sacred Office durst invade, Quick o'er thy Limbs the scurvy Venom ran, And hoary Filth besprinkled all the Man. Transmissive worth adorns the pious Son, The Fathers Virtue, with the Fathers Throne. Lo there he stands; he who the Rage subdued Of Amnon's Sons, and drenched his Sword in Blood. And dost thou Ahaz, Judah's Scourge, disgrace With thy vile Front the Glories of thy Race? See the base King his iron Sceptre bear, His only Praise attends his pious Heir. He in whose Soul the Virtues all conspire, The best good Son from the worst wicked Sire: And, lo! in Hezekiah's golden Reign Long exil'd piety returns again; In genuine Purity again she shines, And with her Presence gilds the long-neglected Shrines. Ill-starr'd does proud Assyria's impious Lord Bid Heav'n to Arms, and vaunt his dreadful Sword. His own vain Threats th'insulting King o'erthrow, And breath new Courage on the gen'rous Foe. Th'avenging Angel, by divine Command, The fiery Sword full blazing in his Hand, Leapt down from Heav'n, amid the Storm he rode, March'd Pestilence before him, as he trode Pale Desolation bath his Steps in Blood. Thick wrapt in Night thro' the proud Host he pass'd Dispensing Death, and drove a furious Blast; Nor bad Destruction give her Revels o'er, Till the gorg'd Sword was drunk with human Gore. But what avails thee, pious Prince, in vain Thy Sceptre rescued, and Assyrians slain, E'en now thy Soul maintains its latest Strife, And Death's chill Grasp congeals the Font of Life; Yet see kind Heav'n renews the brittle Thread, And rolls full fifteen Summers o'er thy Head: Lo! the receding Sun repeats his Way, And like thyself, prolongs the falling Day. Tho' Nature her inverted Course forgo, The Day forget to rest, the Time to flow; Yet shall Jehovah's Servants stand secure, His Mercy fixt eternal shall endure, On them for ever healing Rays shall shine, More mild, more bright, more sure, O Sun, than thine. At length the long expected Prince behold, The last good King, in ancient Days foretold; When Bethel's Altar spake his future Fame, Rent to its Base at good Josiah's Name. Blest happy Prince, o'er whose lamented Urn In plaintive Song all Judah's Daughters mourn: For when sad Sion's softest Sorrows flow, And Jeremiah pours his sweet melodious Woe. But now fall'n Sion, once the Fair, and Great, Sits deep in Dust, abandon'd, desolate. Bleeds her sad Heart, and ever stream her Eyes, And Anguish tears her with convulsive Sighs. The mournful Captive spreads her Hands in vain, Her Hands that rattle with the servile Chain; Till the great Chief, in Heav'ns appointed Time, Leads back her Children to their native Clime: Fair Liberty revives, with all her Joys, And bids her envy'd Walls securely rise. And thou great hollow Dome in Ruin spread, Again shalt raise sublime thy sacred Head: But, ah! with weeping Eyes the Ancients view A faint Resemblance of the old in you. No more th'effulgent Glory of the God Speak awful answers from the mystick Cloud: No more the Altars blaze with Fire divine, And Heav'n has left thy solitary Shrine. Yet in thy Courts hereafter shalt thou see Presence immediate of the Deity: The Light himself reveal'd, the God confest in thee. And now, at length, the fated Term of Years The World's Desire hath brought; and, lo! the God appears. The heav'nly Babe the Virgin Mother bears, And her fond Looks confess the Parents Cares. The pleasing Burden on her Breast she lays, Hangs o'er his Charms, and with a Smile surveys. The Infant smiles, to her fond Bosom prest And wantons sportive in the Mother's Breast. A radiant Glory speaks him all divine, And in the Child the Beams of Manhood shine. But now, alass! far other Views disclose The blackest, comprehensive Scene of Woes. See where Man's voluntary Sacrifice Bows his meek Head, and God eternal dies: Fix'd to the Cross his healing Arms are bound, While copious Mercy streams from ev'ry Wound. Mark the Blood drops that Life exhausting Roll, And the strong Pangs that rend the strugling Soul, As all Death's Tortures, with severe Delay, Exult, and Riot in their noblest prey. And canst thou, stupid Man, those Horrors see, Nor share the Auguish which he bears for thee? Canst thou? while Nature smarts in ev'ry Wound, And each Pang cleaves the Sympathetic Ground, Thy Sins for which his sacred Flesh is torn, Point ev'ry Nail, and sharpen ev'ry Thorn. Lo! the black Sun his Chariot backward driv'n Blots out the Day, and perishes from Heav'n: Earth trembling from her Entrails bears her Part And the rent Rocks upbraid Man's stubborn Heart. The yawning Grave reveals her gloomy Reign, And the cold clay-clad Dead start into Life again. And thou, O Tomb, once more shalt wide display Thy satiate Joys, and give up all their prey. Thou Earth shalt heave absorb'd in Floods of Flame As the last Pangs convulse thy lab'ring Frame, When the same God unshrouded thou shalt see, Wrapt in full Blaze of Power, and Majesty, Ride on the Clouds, while as his Chariot flies; The bright Effusion streams thro' all the skies: Then shall the proud, dissolving Mountains glow, And yielding Rocks in fiery Rivers flow. The molten Deluge round the Globe shall roar, And all Mens Arts, and Labours be no more. Then shall the splendour of th'enliven'd Glass Sink undistinguish'd in the burning Mass; And oh! till Earth, and Sea, and Heav'n decay, Ne'er may that fair Creation fade away: May Winds and Storms those beauteous Colours spare Sill may they last, as permanent, as fair. And the vain Rage of wasting Time repel, And his Tribunal see, whose Cross they paint so well. A true Tale of a certain eminent Physician. The attribution of this poem is questionable.A Humorous Friend of the physical Tribe, For a funeral Sermon, a Parson would bribe. Talk'd of Gloves, and of Scarfs, and of Rings, and a Will, In which he should find a Reward for his Skill. So my Domine Doctor, says he, when I die, Get into your Tub, and say something that's high. To be high, quoth the Priest, on a Subject so low, Is a difficult Task brother Doctor, you know, Of a Creature so odd, O what can I say, Or how earn what I want, and you proffer to pay: O where is your Merit, good Nature, or Grace, Or for what are you known but for playing a Farce. You've Letters, 'tis true, and the Honours possess, Of L. M. or M. D. or perhaps F. R. S. But what are all these for a pulpit Oration, Which after you're gone may travel the Nation. For where is the Man that a Tester won't pay, To see what of you, I could possibly say? Live or die, then my Friend, think no more of this Matter, Unmerited Praise is the keenest of Satyr, Nor oblige me to rail, nor tempt me to flatter.</field>
