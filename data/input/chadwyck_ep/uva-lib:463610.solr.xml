It neuer vexeth me a whit That this man hath more welth or wit: Euery one hath where he may sit. Horat: Serm: Lib. I. The Author in praise of his owne Booke. Commend my Selfe? No! But my Booke I may! And boldly (blamelesse) 'tis Praise-worthy say. How so? The sencelesse Substance well may plead My Selfe I was not, when the Booke I made. Of his deare Friend the Author, H. F. Of what is heere thou'lt not haue any write Prayses: that willing, would: and iustly might, Permit me then! For Ile Praise what I see Deficient heere (thy name Fitz-Ieoffery,) Where English Fitz aright, and I ha'done So rightly art thou called Ieofferyes-Sonne. Then adde time Age but to thy industry, In thee againe will liue Old-Ieoffery. Nath: Gvrlyn. The Author's Answer. Of what is Heere I forbid any Write Praises. Why? Nothing Heere can merite it: Yet Ile Permit thee. Thoul't but Praise my Name. And that's Deficient. Then Praise not for shame Where do (Fitz) right: Write, place it to y? minde: Stil rightly must (Fitz) Ieofferyes come behind wrought: French must turne English first, (strange wonders) (Olde) be a new Borne: The (Sonne) brought to nought. [The First Booke of Satyricall Epigrams] Nvnc satis est dixisse, Ego mira poemata pango: Occupet extremum scabies! Horat: De Arte Poeti. AnglicÃ¨ sic Now 'tis inough to speake, I wondrous Poemes make: Then, Diuell the hindmost take. Satyra prima. Lib: I. VVho'd not at venture Write? So many waies A man may proue a Poet now a daies? Does Nature witt afford to breake a Iest? This is a Poet: and his friends protest He is to blame he Writes not: when (indeed,) Th' Illiterate Gull can neither write nor read. Let Nature faile! Takes he but so much Paine, To write obscurely: adding so much Braine. As end his crabbed sencelesse verse in Rime: This might a Poet beene in Perseus time. And more! (Though Horace in his book reherses) (Nature and Arte are both requir'd in Uerses.) There are those, of their Poetry will vaunt, Which do (God wote) both Wit &amp; Learning want: I know them! Such as they at Table sit Each Iest you speake, will to a Metre fit. And thus your Witt's sell for their priuate gaine And bee accouted Poets for their paine. Others there are, that Others workes suruay, And must from all thinges some thing filtch away. Who if to weaker Braines they can vnfolde A Learned Author: nick a Phrase thats olde: Or change but one word in a line or two: Straight all's their owne, they write, who doubts it so? When I wood scarce beleeu't, though they, in fine, To euery Verse subscribe: By Ioue 'tis mine. Nor is't inough they this in priuate show, But these are Poets, all the world must know. 'Tis strange to see what stretching is of Wits, What spare of speech this plentious Presse begets. Some (if you keepe them company) you'l finde As choise to breake a Iest as to bteake winde. And what's the reason thinke ye? Onely this: All they can speak's too little for the Presse. Where 'tis not losse of Friend, Life, Libertie, Shall cause them keepe a Iest in secrecy. Others haue helpes: when their Inuention faile, Straight they begin abusiuely to raile. Then out comes Whelps of the olde Dog: for sport: Shall barke at Great ones: bite the meaner sort: When the On-setters (after all their paine: For feare, woo'd gladly call them in againe. And these will Poets bee accounted too: Because they Dare doe more then others doe. Though they their Verses write, (a man may say:) As Clown's get Bastards, and straight runne away. Montanus needes will bee a Poet! why? Because the Muses on a Mountaine hy Inhabited. Peto for that his Name Denotes him Poet in the Anagrame: And Quaint Castilio: (since his Father dy'd!) Who many Volumes publish't: and beside Diuers neglected, Left vnto his Son: Which dubbes him Poet, by prÃ¦scription. True! And Castilio will approued bee, Or he will Print his Fathers Legacy. And marke Crisippo, but what shifts he'l finde, Ere he'l bee counted once to come behinde, In euery Booke he will bespeake afore: The comming out, roome for halfe a score Or a dozen Verses, which he'l hugely puffe With commendations of the Authors stuffe. And in Hyperbolyes his Name extoll Yond Homer, Virgill, Ouide, Iuuenall. Vouching no better Volume, ere was Writ, And that himselfe hath had a Hand in it. Oh this vaine-Praise-Affecting Poetry Is a bewitching-itching Leoprosie: That makes men Rub, scrub, rouz and touz their Braine, Pump their Pates dry for Iests: and all to gaine So much Report: might serue to make them vaunt, They are Applauded (though of Ignorant.) They'l snatch, and scratch, and scrape (though nere so ill) And rather smart then holde their fingers still: Be there a Citty show: or sight at Court: Of Acts Heroicke: or of Princely sport: which right to write of, or in Type to tell: Might taxe a Daniels or a Spencers quill.) Marke how these hungerbit Inuentions scud To eye! to spy! All for no other good Then onely this! poore this! But to obtaine: Some fodder for their needy greedy straine. See then how (Enuy) gin's her eyes to fat On dainties plenty, and repines thereat: How muttering Momus (that knowes not to bite,) Grumbles and mumbles mouthfuls out of spite. How currish (Critticks) most seuerely harke: Ready at each sound of applause to barke. How all together, and how each a part Stretch, retch, faine, strain, Inuention, Iudgement Art, Raile, Lybell: what not? Rather then labour loose Iest on your Gesture: or be-lye your cloathes. A subiect fitter for a Beadles fist Then the tart lines of a smart Satyrist. Let Natures causes (which are too profound For euery blockish sottish Pate to sound.) Produce some monster: some rare spectacle: Some seauen yeares Wonder: Ages miracle: Bee it a worke of nere so sleight a waight, It is recorded vp in Metre straight, And counted purchase of no small renowne, To heare the Praise sung in a Market-towne. How many Volumes lye neglected thrust In euery Bench-hole? euery heape of dust? Which from some Gowries practise, Powder plot, Or Tiburne Lectur's, all their substance got: Yet tosse our Time-stalles youll admire the rout Of carelesse fearelesse Pamphlets flye about. Bookes, made of Ballades: Workes: of Playes, Sightes, to be Read: of my Lo: Maiors day's: Post's, lately set forth: Bearing (their Backe at) Letters, of all sorts: An intollerable Packet. Villains discouery, by Lanthorn and Candle-light: (strange if the author should not see it to h?dle right) A Quest of Inquirie: (Iacke a Douer's) The Iests of Scoggin: and diuers others (which no man Better the Stationer knowes) Wonderfull Writers; Poets in Prose. What poste pin'd Poets that on each base Theame, With Inuocations vexe Apollo's name. Springes for Woodcockes: Doctor Merriman: Rub and a good Cast: Taylor the Ferriman. Fennor, with his Vnisounding Eare word; The vnreasonable Epigramatist of Hereford: Rowland with his Knaues a murniuall; Non worth the calling for, a fire burne em all: And number numberlesse that march (vntolde) Mongst Almanacks and Pippins, to be solde. Apologie. These Ill which berter Dare th? know to wright, Makes those (I know) not dare w? better might; For who ist now attempts to Print, but knowes, He must be one or censured on, of Those! For my part (Gallants) it was nere my hap, On high Pernassus Top, to take a nap: Or the Diuine Nine sisters Fount to see: Whence I might steale a sip of Poetry. These Idle Uerses (which I Idle made) None but the Idle I request to read: Then what Applause looke I for, all may guesse, When none may looke for Praise from Idlenes. Finis Saty: Prima. Satyra Secunda. A Morall Satyre. Qvidam Sunt Videntur &amp; non Sunt Videntur. ProÃ¦mium. I taxe no Times, I beare no Furyes scourge: I bring no powerfull Fountaine springes to purge This vicefull Lerna, this Angean slye, From long neglected noysome filthery. Vaunt Varlots then: Grizely Tartarian curres: Vice-Pack-horses: Swaines of inchanting pleasures: Wallow in Lake of Leaudnesse: racket: yell And all the world with thundring vproare fill, Till angry Ioue his Chaos drench agen And a new nature of milde molde begin. Yet knowe (Earths Of-scums) I haue force, and woo'd Vncase, vnlase, your Leaudnes: make ye scud: Lash at Lines length: and instrike such a print, Shu'd make ye startle, had ye hartes of flint, Coo'd I finde Patrons to maintaine me in't. Satyra. Bvt range my Muse! find out some fresher Game, Some Mayden matter, some vnchased Theame. Beat through y? throwes of these disordered times. The thorny thickets of contagious crimes, And rouz from squat, pursue with Ã¦ger cry, The lurking Leaudnesse, strong scent villany, Of those close Foxes, who (in milder skins) Inuey, and guesse inuectiuely at Sinnes: Bite with sharpe censure: and seuerely scan The inward Vertues, by the outward man. Beshrow mee (Sirs) if I dare strout in street, Winke at a Window: A God-dam-me greet: Vsher a Lady: but salute her Gloue: Or Kisse a Maide for manners more then Loue: Cringe to a Seriuener: be conuersing seene In Ludgate, with a broken Citizen: Turne oft in Pauls: call for a stoole o'th Stage: Or walke atended with my Hackney Page: Pace Turnball, Shorditch, Long-lane: or Pickt-hatch, Least I be taken by this heedfull watch. These pickthanke Pesants; that with Lynceus eye, Inspect mans Actions too Iniuriously. First to yon Masse of man: yon loade of Guts, That all he handles in his belly puts: Who euery meales meate makes a Masse cry, Of Shambles, Poultry, Sea variety. How on the Table he his Panch doth rest, And stuffes it as a Wallet of the best. Yet close his Buttockes rammes vp as in Pound For feare o'th worst, to'th' good-behauiour bound. Snorts at mid-day: yet startles at the sturre, Of a betraying Boote, or tel-tale Spurre: Cryes out of Fashions, as of Fasting-dayes, Rebukes Excesse: gainst Vanityes inueyes: Hates Vice as Hunger: and abhorres to stand In sight of a (Sir reuerence) Saffron-band. Tell him his Worship is too strictly wise: His closest Trounces, full as full of vice. As wide from Vertues meane as Largest size. Next to yon Prester Iohn, that Learned Clarke: Who after all my closest acts doth harke. A man, that for a Wise one sure woo'd passe, Shu'd there but 6. bee, as there 7. was: Hee heretofore (out of his Loue exceeding) Woo'd euer bee examining my Reading: Now (more Officious) euer Checking is: A strickt Remembrancer of all amisse. Bid him bee lesse in Office: more in Loue: Least he ere long Iacke out of Office proue. Laugh, Laugh, Democritus! who can hold to heare Socraticke Doctors, Catoes most austeer. Roule vp the Records of Antiquity, To frame Abridgements for youth's Liberty. Accuse Wits folly. Times strange alterations: The vaine expence of cloth consuming fashions, When their allowance was (themselues can tell) At least vnto a Codpisse halfe an Ell. Lend me Athenian but a while thy light: To scowre the scoutes, the Lurking holes of Spite, And execrable Enuy: see the rout Of Rascals: venome Vermin, I'le finde out: Cankermouth'd Catchpoles, that in Ambush lye, To wreck, to seck Vertues Ã¦ternitie: With poysnous blast of miscreant Infamy. (Iustinian) is too Fortunate to beare The name of Iust: (Flora) too Curtious farre To harbour Honesty: (Varro) held to bee Vaine, for his skilfull vaine in Poetry. (Fantasticke) cannot with his Flaunders feete Lock'd in his foure-wheele-casket vex the street: Knocke in a Tauerne, but his Father heares, Some 20 Leagues off. Luxurio feares Retaine a seruant fairer then his wife: Nor will Lorella in despaire of Life Tell of her side-stitch or the Belly-ake, Least she bee said Lucinas ayde to lacke. Who is from scourge of Censure can scape free, Yea (Temperate Nature) men will jerke at thee! How suffer some but for a Sanguin Nose? A Scarlet sconce? when each Logitian knowes 'Tis Vertues colour. How enuy some at A Stirrill Chin? Or a top naked Pate? Emblem of Truth, and Graces. What reproofe Goes with a Limping Leg? Or Vulcan Hoofe? Yea some so farre presume, as to define Knaues, by their Bunch-back's, and their Goggle-eyne When Accidents (affirmes the Stagerite) Not Naturall cause no note but in Spirit. Peace then Melampus, peace Albertus, Cocles: PtolÅmie, Rasis, and Auerroes. Gallon, Palemon: hence be silent all, Or proue the cunning Huperphisicall. And all lesse learn'd in Rules of Phisnomy: That Natures notes, holde markes of Infamy. Else (mincing Madam's) why doe we (alas!) Pine at your Pencill and conspiring Glasse? Your Curles, Purles, Perriwigs, your Whal eb one wheels: That shelter all defects from head to heeles. Making but Good what these count Vicious: Yet not iniustly termed odious. To strout in Purple or rich Scarlet dye With siluer barres begarded thriftily: To set in print the Haire: Character the Face: Or dye in graine the Ruffe for Visage grace. To clog the Eare with plummets: clag the wrests With Busk-points, Ribbons, or Rebato-Twists: From Barbors tyranny to saue a locke, His Mistris wanton fingers to prouoke: Such Trifles, Toyes: in these sharpe Crittitks view, Throwes vs in number of the damued Crue.

To the worthy Author vpon these Epigrams. Let me not whilst I praise an Epigram, Deserue a Satyre: Let not me who am As nice in praising as dispraisiug still, Commend your worke as trading Poets will: For then I might praise Bookes I neuer read, Bookes sencelesse, at least not Interpreted, And sweare I know them good. Thus many doe Commend and yet maintaine, their credits too: Which, my poore Innocence hath much admir'd, Till I perceiu'd these Poets who are hir'd, In all respects are Shop-keepers: And they Grow Bankroupts, if forsworne but once a day: So these in wit grow beggerly whose sloath Hath nothing but a Wager, or an Oath To proue their owne or other mens desert: And did not my per-vsall now conuert My Iudgement to consider what I praise: I might (as they) approue, and many wayes Recant hereafter: But I giue them leaue To Write vpon me, when they shall perceiue Such scorn'd Inconstancie; and if they please To doo't in Epigrams, Let them first learne These. Which if they can learne, they may truely boast, They haue aduantage gotten with the most. Io: Stephens. The Third Booke of Humours: Intituled Notes from Black-Fryers. Epigram.

Tush! mooue me not: yet (doubtles) tis rare stuff And may Take, why not? if so! Good inough. How ere (Nat) Patronize it, thou canst tell, (If ought mislike:) I meant, and wish all well. Then, Good: or Bad: heer (Sirs!) on liking take it If Good, 'tis I: If Bad: tis you that make it. Notes from Black-Fryers. What (friend Philemo) let me thy corpes Imbrace! So jumpe met in this vnfrequented place? Then, faith! 'lets Frolique't: pre'thee whats y? Play? (The first I visited this twelue monthes day.) (They say)A new Inuented Toy of Purle That ieoparded his Necke, to steale a Girle Of 12: And (lying fast impounded for't) Hath hither sent his Beard, to Act his part. Against all those in open Malice bent, That would not freely to the Theft consent. Faines all to's wish, and in the Epilogue, Goes out applauded for a famous ? Now hang me if I did not looke at first, For some such stuffe by the fond peoples thrust. Then stay! Ile see't, and sit it out (what ere) Had I at comming forth tooke a Glister: Had Fate fore-read me in a Croude to dye: To bee made Adder-deafe with Pippin-crye. Come let's bethink our selues what may be found To deceiue Time with, till the second sound: Out with these matches fore-runners of Smoake, This Indian pastime I could neuer brooke. See (Captaine Martin) he ith' Renounce me Band That in the middle Region doth stand Woth' reputation steele! Faith! lets remoue, Into his Ranke, (if such discourse you Loue) Hee'l tell of Basilisks, Trenches, Retires: Of Pallizadoes, Parepets, Frontires: Of Cnluerins, and Baricadoes too: What to bee Harquebazerd: to lye in Perdue: How many men a Souldier ought to slay For a Lieutenant-ship: or Twelue month Pay. Hee'l read a Lecture (by his skill exceeding) O Reputation: when it lyes a Bleeding: When Tutcht: when Ingaged: when quite Dead, Or How none may euer Fight once Baffled. What satisfaction for the Lye: and when Quarrels are mortall: when Seconds may come in. Then of the Nether-lands! what Passes there: What stout Performances: wherein hee'l sweare As many weekely fall but for the Lye, As did in hottest time of Sicknesse dye. Last for his Manhood: how in furie (crost) For a false reckoning once he slew his Host. And late in England, (since his comming o're) Into the Channell flung an Oyster-whoore. For taking th' wall of him: seeme but to doubt (The least) of these: straight he will plucke ye out Handfuls of Reputation: gain'd of those That dared not his Valour counterpose. But wronging him: and call'd to account for't In Satisfaction from their Hands woo'd part. Which he puts vp, and gloriously puts forth In Ordinaries to proclaime his worth, Thinking to get (what common sence denyes) Credit: by Pocketting vp Iniuryes. Then Learne of him, he'l teach you how yee might Be counted Valiant, and neuer Fight. Look next to him to, One we both know well, (Sir Iland Hunt) a Trauailer that will tell Of stranger Things then Tatterd Tom ere li't of, Then Pliny, or Heroditus e're writ of: How he a remnant lately brought with him Of Iacobs Ladder from Ierusalem: At the Barmodies how the Fishes fly. Of Lands inriched by a Lottery. Of Affricke, Ãgypt: with strange Monsters fild, Such as nere Noahs Arke: nere Eden held. And rarer Rarities, then all of these: Iust now to bee discouered (if yee please!) Such as woo'd make a Blind-man fond to see: Conuicted Gallants loose their hopes and flie, Most younger Brothers fell their Lands to buy, Guyanian Plumes: like Icarus to fly. Bvt stay! see heere (but newly Entred,) A Cheapside Dame, by th' Tittle on her head! Plot (Villain!) plot! Let's lay our heads together! We may deuise perchance to get her hither. (If wee to-gether cunniningly compact) Shee'l holde vs dooing till the Latter Act. And (on my life) Inuite vs Supper home, Wee'l thrust hard for it. but wee'l finde her rome, Heer Mis? (pox ont! she's past, she'l not come ore, Sure shee's bespoken for a box before. Knowest thou yon world of fashions now comes in In Turkie colours carued to the skin. Mounted Pelonianly vntill hee reeles, That scornes (so much) plaine dealing at his heeles. His Boote speakes Spanish to his Scottish Spurres, His Sute cut Frenchly, round bestucke with Burres. Pure Holland is his Shirt, which proudly faire, Seemes to out-face his Doublet euery where, His Haire like to your Moor's or Irish Lockes, His chiefest Dyet, Indian minced Dockes. What Countrey may-game might wee this suppose, Sure one woo'd thinke a Roman by his Nose. No! In his Habite better vnderstand, Hee is of England by his Yellow Band. Now Mars defend vs! seest thou who comes yonder? Monstrous! A Woman of the masculine Gender. Looke! thou mayst well descry her by her groath, Out, point not man! Least wee be beaten both. Eye her a little, marke but where shee'l goe, Now (by this hand) into the Gallants Roe. Let her alone! What ere she giues to stand, Shee'l make her selfe a gayner, By the Hand. What think'st thou of yon plumed Dandebrat, Yon Ladyes Shittle-cocke, Egyptian Rat: Yon Musk-ball, Milke-sop: yon French Sincopace: That Vshers in, with a Coranto grace. Yon Gilded March-pane: yon All Verdingall, This is the Puppet, which the Ladyes all Send for of purpose and solicite so To daunce with them. Pray (Sir) a step or two. A Galliard or a Iigg: Pox ont! cryes hee, That ere I knew this Toyling faculty. Yet marke! No sooner shall the Cornets blow, But ye shall haue him skipping too and fro. A Stoole and Cushion! Enter Tissue slop! Vengeance! I know him well, did he not drop. Out of the Tyring-house? Then how (the duse) Comes the mishapen Prodigall so spruse, His year's Reuenewes (I dare stand vnto't,) Is not of worth to purchase such a Sute. Tush! is it now to question Gallantry, When No-land for a rich Gratuity, May Seale as deepe as can Auaro's Heire, That may dispend fiue hundred a yeare? When Tradesmen take by whole sale all they can, Venting it out, on day, to any Man. And then themselues for Twelu-pence in y? pound, Will in the payment of the Debt be bound And escape free by Breaking. This an age To feare preferment? When a Rascall Page An Abiect outside shall presume to Woe Rich bruted (Cashia:) and hope better too, Then hee that of the Of-scums of his Braine, Can a man better then the (Vice) maintaine. (Tut! 'tis the Mothers plot! Now she shall see The Court sometimes! Oh Carnall Pollicy!) Then who in Studdy woo'd spend Time in vaine? Omit youth's pleasures for a fruitlesse paine? Or for an Ayrie puffe of Enuy'd Praise, Liue bound to th' Good-behauiour all his dayes. Hang't! Let's be Iouiall! Braue it whilst we can! Whats Coyne ordain'd for, but the vse of Man? To Borrow is a Vertue, when to Lend, Is to beget an euerlasting freind: And may a man haue more said in his grace, Then to bee Credited in euery place? Hee's not a Gentleman I dare maintaine, Whose Word runnes not as Current as his Coyne. A Pipe heere (Sirra) no Sophistocate. (Villain) the best: what ere you prize it at. Tell yonder Lady, with the Yellow fan, I shall be proude to Vsher her anon: My Coach stands ready. Lord how me thinkes I long! To carue the inside of a dry'd Neats-tong. England cannot afford a kinder relish, For Backragg, Deale, or your more pleasing Renish When shall we make a pleasant cut to Douer, In a mad merry Humor? And send ouer? A Laugh shall rouz the Hage: shake Lesbon walls: And raisd in Armes the fearfull Portugalls. Say Gallants (faith) shall's neuer see the day, When wee shall Fish-street once againe suruey. A butterd Crab or Lobsters leg to get, O Venus! How a Life I sauour it? Who woo'd not all his Land spend had hee more, Then in a day a Kite could hoouer ore. T'inioy the pleasant Harmony that wee Finde in this Microcosme, Man's societie. When all is gone, tis weaknesse to dispaire, Are there not wealthy Widdowes eu'ry where. Ambitious Sick, woo'd part from all their Good, To crowne their latter dayes with a French-hood? Are there not Pates, in strange discoueries teaching where mountains are of Gold? s'fut, tis but fetching! Twenty such Fetches hath the (Sharke) to moue Gallants of the first Head, but to approue His swaggering Humor, vowes that all he spends, He getteth brauely by his Fingers ends. There's not a Cheapside Mercer (if he looke) That will not sweare to't deeply on his booke. No noted Notary in Cornwell row, But is subscribed Witnesse there too. Silkmen. Haberdashers, Tradesman all: Inamor'd on him, for his Custome call, And he takes all of them But woe to him If he bee taken but by one of Them. :Want it for Women woe shu'd all be men. I cannot present better instance, then In yon Spruse Coxcombe, yon Affecting Asse, That neuer walkes without his Looking-glasse, In a Tobacco box, or Diall set, That he may priuately conferre with it. How his Band jumpeth with his Peccadilly, Whether his Band strings ballance equally: Which way his Feather wagg's: And (to say truth) What wordes in vtterance best become his mouth. Oh! Hadst thou yesterday beheld the Valour I saw him exercising on his Taylour. How, out of measure, hee the Ruscall beat, Not fitting to his minde his Doublet. Lord! how I laught to see the witlesse Noddy, Durst not reply, he meant it to his Body. See Villain, Rogue! (And in he shrinks his brest) Oh Heauens! Too wide a handfull at the least, Straight it is Cut! And then proues (being try'd) As much too little on the other side. But what skil't! Hee'l haue an attractiue Lace, And Whalebone-bodyes, for the better grace. Admit spare dyet, on no sustnance feed, But Oatmeale, Milke, and crums of Barly-bread. Vse Exercise vntill at last hee fit: (With much adoe) his Body vnto it. Hee'l not approach a Tauerne, no nor drinke ye To saue his life Hot-water, (wherefore thinke ye,) For heating's Liuer! Which some may suppose Scalding hote, by the Bubbles on his Nose. Hee'l put vp any publique foule disgrace, Rather then hazzard cutting of his Face. If in his Element you'd haue the (Foole!) Aske him when he came from the Dauncing-school Whereas much Leather he doth dayly waste In the French Cringe, which Ieremy brought last. And more, then Coriat (I dare maintaine) In going to the Alpes and backe againe. Whereof, that all the world may notice take, See! euery step an Honor hee doth make That Ladyes, may denote him with their Fan, As he goes by, with a Lo: Hee's the man. Is't not a thing to bee admired at That any man should Sing himselfe in debt. Then who'd not giue as willingly a groate, To heare (Fantasticks) admirable note? :As see a Mandrake, or a Sea-monster: :Edwards blade: with the Tombes at Westminster. The Eagle at the Tower: St. Iames's Rarityes: The Estrich, or Beauer, that woo'd worrey Trees? (Amorous Fantasticke) that did neuer ayme at A smaller Rise, then Ela in the Gamat. That ne're conuersed but with men of Note, Your Crotchet Pate, and your Organick Throat. Neuer Ambitious more then to be able, But to attaine vnto a Chamber Treble. Wondrous proficient! See how the Gentlewomen Throng to his Chamber doore, but dare not come in, Why? least he rauish them! Tush! Laugh ye not, H'as done (I wosse) as great exploites as that. (Or else he cracks) the sweetnesse of his voyce Ore-heard of Ladyes, hath procur'd him choyse Of Matches: Noble, Rich: but hee'l not meddle, And why (I pray?) for cracking of his Treble. No! hee'l with better industry make tryall, If hee can Match his Treble to the Uioll. Gainst when, hee hath proclaim'd throughout the Citty, To All your Witts, an Angell for a Ditty: Faith! was he heere wee'd bargain for a Rime, And heere he comes. So truely he keepes Time. Bvt h'st! with him Crabbed (Websterio) The Play-wright, Cart-wright: whether? either! hoâ No further. Looke as yee'd bee look't into: Sit as ye woo'd be Read: Lord! who woo'd know him? Was euer man so mangl'd with a Poem? See how he drawes his mouth awry of late, How he scrubs: wrings his wrests: scratches his Pate. A Midwife! helpe! By his Braines coitus, Some Centaure strange: some huge Bucephalus, Or Pallas (sure) ingendred in his Braine, Strike Vulcan with thy hammer once againe. This is the Crittick that (of all the rest) I'de not haue view mee, yet I feare him least, Heer's not a word cursiuely I haue Writ, But hee'l Industriously examine it. And in some 12. monthes hence (or there about) Set in a shamefull sheete, my errors out. But what care I it will be so obscure, That none shall vnderstand him (I am sure.) Others may chance (that know me not a right,) Report (iniuriously) all my delight, And strength of studdy I doe wholly bend To this Losse-labour and no other end. To these I wish my scandald Muse reply In as plaine tearmes as may bee 'Tis a lye. Heer's but Pate-pastime: Play-house Obseruation, Fruits of the vacants howers of a Vacation. Then (say all what they can) I am sure of this, That for Play-time it is not spent amisse. Semel insaniuimus omnes. Once wee haue all Beene Iouiall. FINIS To his worthy Friend, H. F. vpon his Notes from Black-Fryers. Had the Black-Fryers beene still vn-suppressd, I cannot thinke their Cloysters had bin blessd With better contemplations: Seeing now Lesse may be gleand from Puritanes then you Haue gathered from the Play-house. And I must (Though't bee a Players vice to be vniust, To Verse not yeelding coyne) let Players know They cannot recompence your labour: Though They grace you with a Chayre vpon the Stage, And take no money of you nor your Page. For now the Humours which oppresse Playes most, Shall (if the owners can feele shame) be lost: And when they so conuerted doe allow, What they dislik'd once, Players must thanke you, And Poets too: for both of them will saue Much in true Verse, which hisses might depraue: Since you haue so refin'd their Audience, That now good Playes will neuer neede defence. Io: Stephens Epilogue. The Author for Himselfe. I am no Poet! (yet I doe not know Why I should not: or why I should be so.) I can (I must confesse) a Metre scan: And Iudge of Verses as an other man. I haue been Trayn'd vp'mongst the Muses: (more!) The sacred Name of PhÃ¦bus I adore. Yet I no Poet am! (I'de haue ye know) I am no Poet (as the world goes now.) :My Muse cannot a Note so poorly frame, :As Inuocate a Penny-Patrons name. :I cannot speake and vnspeake (as I lift:) :Exchange a sound friend for a broken Iest: :Conferre with Fountaines: or conuerse with Tree: :Admit in my discourse Hyperbolyes. I cannot highly praise Those highest are Because they sit in Honours lofty chayre. Nor make their States in Sonnets happy knowne, Being (perchance) lesse happy then mine owne. I cannot sing my Mistris shee is Faire: Tell her of her Lilly Hand: her golden Haire, Fetch a Comparison (beyond the Moone,) To proue her constant in Affection. :I dare not Her so much as Louely call: :Or say I have a Mistris at all. :Why? Ere too morrow, she will changed bee: :And leave me laught at for my Poetry. Had I of Scoggins Crowes writ: or set out In Womans Praises what I was about. I am perswaded (yet I cannot tell) I had a Poet prou'd against my will. Yet (ye vnproued good) blame not because I yet as (doubtfull on your merits) pause. I will produce and Patronize it too: Finde I but one amongst so many true. But Faine I cannot, heere is not a word, Which I dare not maintaine true with my sword. Poets men Lyers call. If so! Then (know it) Hee is a Poet, doth mee call a Poet. Post-script to his Book-binder. Stationer) A Good turne to thee I owe: Heere! I will pay thee now in Folio. But stay! Not soe: that I woo'd haue thee put Mee in the Folio: or the Quarto cut. Rather contriue mee to the Smallest size, Least I bee eaten vnder Pippin-pyes. Or in th' Apothicaryes shop bee seene To wrap Drugg's: or to dry Tobacco in. First (might I chuse) I would be bound to wipe, Where he discharged last his Glister-pipe. The Character I care not, Great, or Small, So I bee plainly vnderstood of all. Onely preserue mee from the sight of Those, That cannot but must Read me in the Nose. Then care to cast mee: not ith' Learned Roe, Least I the Learned censure vndergoe. Not lay me with scald Poets least I titch, And so become infected with Their itch. Let not each Pesant, each Mecannick Asse, That neer knew further then his Horn-booke crosse. Each rauin-Rusticke: each illiterate Gull: Buy of my Poesie, by pocket full. Bookes like made-Dishes may for Daintyes goe, Yet will not euery pallate taste 'em so: Then were it good, I should inioyne the Sell. Mee vnto none but those that loue me well. If any Puff-paste, Bumbaste Iobernole, Wrapt in the Hangings of a Brokers-stall. A halfe-Nose: or a Carbonado'd face: Of a suspitious subtill Serpents pace. Trust to a Basket-hilt: chances to drop, But for a Resting-roome into thy shop. And catches in his fatall hand my Rime. To lurke in it, vntill hee see his Time. Thrust him out head-long, for (beleiue him not) Now (by the Mace) it is a Counter-plot. If thou behold a Courtcast Satten-show, Fallen from the Fashion a Degree or two. One as goes purueying vp and downe for Tales, To Iest his hungry stomacke into meales. That with a merry pocket-Pamphlet will, For a weeke after Laugh his Belly full. Send him to Sojourne with Duke Humfrey, Let him starue ere hee get a bitt of mee. Least lying (Read) neglected in his Slop, I bee conueyed vnto the Brokers-shop. Or by his theeuish Page discouered: Quickly conuerted into Ginger-bread. If any Younger Brother, that noe more Hath then a Daggle-tayl'd Sheep-skin kept in store: Whose Annuall fleece will but bare meanes afford, And with the Echer of his Brothers bord. That sits a Ledger at his Fathers Table: My Booke woo'd foudly purchase: (hardly able,) To win, the presence by the Fiers side, Of Mrs. Sis, or Sue the Dary-maide. Or chooke the Rusticke Leather-lobs with laughter Bid him goe studdy how to liue hereafter: Read where more sollid substance hee may get To Live vpon, or learne to goe in Debt. Ye, ye, Braue Gallants: Patrons of liuely mirth: Ye, the young hopefull Land-Lords of the Earth: The youth of youth! That read most liberally, More out of Pastime then necessity. Yee worthy Worthyes! None elss (might I chuse) Doe I desire my Poesie peruse. For to saue charges: ere the Playes begin: Or when the Lord of Libertie comes in. And if a Booke must needs a Patron haue, Yours is the onely Patronage I craue. Others I wish the Stationer fore-warne. With a Hand's off: It is not for your turne. FINIS.</field>
