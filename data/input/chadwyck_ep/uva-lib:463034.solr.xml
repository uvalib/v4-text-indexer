      <field name="fulltext">THE RECOVERIE OF HIERVSALEM OF S?. TORQVATO TASSO, The first Song. I sing the godly armes, and that Chieftaine, Who great Sepulchre of our Lord did free, Much with his hande, much wrought he with his braine: Much in his glorious conquest suffred hee: And hell in vaine hit selfe opposde, in vaine The mixed troopes Asian and Libick flee To armes, for heauen him fauour'd, and he drew To sacred ensignes his straid mates a new. O Muse, thou that thy head not compassest, With fading bayes, which Helicon doth beare: But boue in skyes, amids the Quyers blest, Dost golden crowne of starres immortall weare, Celestiall flames breath thou into my brest, Enlighten thou my Song, and pardon where, I fainings weaue with truth, and verse with art, Of pleasings deckt, wherein thou hast no part. Thou knowst, where luring Parnase most poures out His sweetenesse, all the world doth after runne, And that truth season'd with smoth verse, from doubt, The waywardst (flocking) to beleeue hath wonne, So cup, his brimmes earst liquorisht about With sweete, we giue to our diseased Sonne. Beguilde he drinkes some bitter iuyce the while, And doth his life receiue from such a guile. Thou noble minded Alfonse, who dost saue From Fortunes furie, and to port dost steare Me wandring pilgrime, midst of many a waue, And many a rocke betost, and drencht welneare, My verse with friendly grace t'accept vouchsaue, Which as in vow, sacred to thee I beare. One day perhaps, my pen forehalsening, Will dare, what now of thee tis purposing. If euer Christians to agreement growe, And with their Nauy, and their force by land, A pray so great and wrong, from Turkish foe Seeke to regaine, dew reason doth command, That of that soyle the Scepter they bestowe, Or of those seas, if so thy pleasure stand, On thee, thou Godfreys countermate, my rime Attend, and armes prouide in this meane time. Since Christian campe for high exploit to th'East Had past, the last of sixe yeares on now ranne, And Nice by force, and Antioch not least Of power, by warlike policie they wanne. Wheregainst when Persians passing number preast, In battaile bold they hit defended thanne. And Tortose gat, which done, to winters raigne They yeelde, and stay the comming yeere againe. The season, by his kind enclinde to weat, Which layes vp armes, welnie his course now ends, When Sire eternall from his loftie seat, Which in the purest part of heauen extends, And from the lowest hell, what space is great To starres, so farre aboue the starres ascends, Lookes downe, and in one blinck, and in one vew, Comprizeth all what so the world can shew. Ech thing he viewes, and then he fixt his eye On Syria, where Christian Princes stay, And with that sight, which percingly can spy, What closest vp humaine affections lay, He Godfrey sees, who Panims lewd to fly From sacred Citie would enforce away. And full of faith, and full of zeale in heart, All worldly wealth, rule, glory, layes apart. But he in Baldwyn sees a greedie vaine, Which bent to humaine greatnesse high aspires, He Tancred sees, his life hold in disdaine, So much a fond loue him afflicting fires, And Boemund he sees, for his new raigne, Of Antioch, foundations deepe desires To ground, and lawes enacts, and orders layth, And arts brings in, and plants the Christen fayth. And in this course he entred is so farre, That ought but that, hit seemes of nought he weyes, He skryes Rinaldos mind, addict to warre, And working spirits, much abhorring ease, No lust of gold in him, no thoughts there are Of rule, but great and much enflam'd of prayse, He skryes that at the mouth he hangs of Gwelfe: And old examples rare frames to himselfe. When inmost sense of these and other sprights, The King of all the world had vnfould: He calles him to, of the Angelicke lights, Him that mongst first, the second ranck doth hould: A faithfull Truchman, Gabriell that hights, A Nuntio glad, twixt Soules of better mould, And God to vs downe heau'ns decrees who shoes, And vp to heau'n who with mens prayers goes. God to his Nuntio said, seeke Godfrey out, And tell him in my name, why stands he still? The warres againe why goes he not about? Hierusalem opprest to free from ill: Captaines to counsell let him call, and rout Of sluggards rayse, that he be chiefe I will: I here him chuse, and those below that are Tofore his mates, shall be his men of warre. So spake he: Gabriel himselfe addrest, Swift to performe the things in charge he takes, His shape vnseene, with aire he doth inuest, And vnto mortall sence hit subiect makes, Mans lims, mans looke, t'apparence he possest, Which yet celestiall maiestie pertakes: Twixt youth and childhood bounded seeme his dayes, His golden lockes he doth adorne with rayes. He puts on siluer wings, yfrendg'de with gold, Wearilesse nymble, of most plyant sway, With these he partes the winds, and clouds, and hold Doth flight with these aloft the earth and sea: Attyred thus, to worlds lower mould, This messenger of skyes directes his way: On Liban mountaine hou'ring first he stayd, And twixt his egall wings himselfe he wayd. There hence againe, to pastures of Tortose, Plump downe directly leuels he his flight. From easterne coast the new sunne then arose, Part vp, but of more part waues hid the sight: And earely Godfrey that mornetide bestowes In prayre to God, as aye his vsage hight. When like the Sunne, but farre and far more cleare Th'Angell to him doth from the East appeare. And thus bespake, Godfrey, now season tides, That best with warriours seruice doth agree: Why thwart you lingring then, while fast it slides? And not Hierusalem from thraldome free? Do thou to counsaile call the peoples guides, Do thou the slow their worke to finish see. God for their Chiefetaine thee hath deemed fit, And glad at once they shall themselues submit. God me this message sent, and I reueale To thee his mind in his owne name, how great A hope of victorie to haue? a zeale How great, of host thy charge hooues thee to heat? He ceast, and vanisht flew to th'vpper deale, And purest portion of the heauenly seat. Godfrey those words, and that his shining bright Daz'led in eyes, and did in heart affright. But fright once gone, and hauing well bethought, Who came, who sent, and what to him was said: Of earst he wisht, he now a fire hath cought To end the warre whose charge God on him laid. Not for the heau'ns him sole this honour brought, Ambitions winde puffing his stomacke swaid: But all his will did more in will enflame, Of his deare Lord, as sparke becomes a flame. Then his Heroicke mates disperst about, But not farre off, t'assemble he inuites: Letter to letter, message on message out He sendes, aduice with praier he vnites. What so may slocke or pricke a courage stout, What skill dull vertue to awake endites: Seemes all he findes, with efficacie such, As he enforceth, yet contenteth much. The leaders came, the rest ensew'd also Boemund alone doth from this meeting stay: Part campt abroad, part them in circuit stowe, Another part within Tortosa lay. The nobles of the campe to counsell goe, (A glorious Senate) on a solemne day. Then godly Godfrey thus makes silence breach; Goodly of countnance, and as shrill of speach. Champions of God chosen by king of sky, Of his true faith the damage to restore, Whom midst of armes, and midst of guiles, safely He rul'de and guided both at sea and shore: So as of rebell realmes many and many In so few yeares through vs him now adore. And mongst the Nations vanquisht and subdew'd, His ensignes are aduanst, his name renew'd. We haue not left our pledges sweete, nor neast Natiue to vs (if I beleeue aright) Nor sold our liues to trustlesse seas beheast, And to the perill of farre distant fight, To gaine of fames short blast the vulgar feast, Or that Barbarians land, we claime our right. For our deseigns in straight bounds th? were pent, Slender our hire gainst soules or bloud yspent. But vtmost purpose which our thoughts did beare, Was Sions noble wals by force to gaine: And Christen brothers to enfranchize there, From yoake vnworthy of their thralled paine, In Palestine a kingdome new to reare, Where safely plast, might godlines sustaine. That holy Pilgrims farre from dread of way, That great Tombe might adore, and vowings pay. Our deedes till this, for perill haue beene great, For trauell more then great, for honour small, For our mayn purpose nought, if we as yeat Make stop, or bent of armes elsewhere doe call. What bootes it out of Europe to haue fett Fewell of force, and Asia fire withall? When as at last of these huge sturres we wend, Not kingdomes rays'd, but ruin'd are the end. He buildeth not, who so his soueraigntie On worldly ground-plots vp to raise hath care: Where midst vnnumbred troopes of Paganie, Strangers in faith, few of his Countrey are, Where of the Greekes he hopes no loyaltie, And westerne succours can ariue so spare. But ruynes he procures, with which opprest, Sole for himselfe a Sepulchre he drest. Turkes, Persians, Antioch, noble matters be, In name magnificent, and in effect: Yet workes not ours, but heauens largesse we Them deeme: Conquests of wonder vnexpect. Now if the giuer them wrong turned see, And misemployed from their course direct: I feare he'l reaue them quite, and honour past So great, will waxe the peoples scorne at last. Ah be there none (for loue of God) that guifts So pleasing, to bad vses turne and spill, To web of these so high attempting drifts, Let threed and end of worke be suited still: Now that the season to our seruice shifts, Now that ech passage we haue free at will, Why to the Citie runne we not? thats set Our conquests bound: who ist that can vs let? My Lords I do protest, and that which I Do thus protest, the present world shall heare, And that to come shall heare, and Saints on hie Do heare, the time long since did ripe appeare: And yet fits our exploit, but lie you still, And t'will most doubtfull fall that now is cleare. I prophesie if our course be delayde, The Palestine from Egypt shall haue ayde. He spake, his speech a muttring short befell, Next after solitarie Peter rose, Though priuate, mongst the princes at counsell, As he from whom that voyage chiefly groes, What Godfrey doth exhort, I say aswell, No doubt here fals, the truth so certaine shoes, It skryes hit selfe, he plaine demonstrance gaue, Th'allowance longs to you, sole t'adde I haue. If I remember well the brawles and shame, As t'were of purpose by you made and borne, Your froward counsels and proceedings lame, Which midst of working made your works forlorne, I gesse that from another head there came The cause of all these stops, and concord torne, Namely th'authoritie in many wits, And many men that equall peyzed sits. Where onely one doth not command, from whom Iudgement of paines and prices may depend: From whom may offices and charges come, There still the rule to eyther side will bend: Ah of these members friendly ioyn'd, in some One bodie make, and make a head to wend And guide the rest, let one the Scepter beare, And let him rule as King and Prince he weare. The olde man silenst here. What thoughts? what breasts? Are shut fr? thee breath sacred! heat diuine! Thou in the Hermite dost enspire these heasts, And in the knights harts thou the same dost shrine, Th'ingraft, th'inborne affections thou outwrests Of rule, of libertie, of honours signe. So as both Gwelfe and Guillam chiefe in place, Did Godfrey first with name of Chieftaine grace. The rest allowance gaue, henceforth must be Their part t'aduise, the others to direct: Conditions to the conquer'd grant shall hee, Warre, peace, when, where he please elect, The rest now brought to becke, earst equall free, The charge of his commandments are t'effect. This so agreed, the fame out flies, and wide Spreading it self through tongs of men doth glide. To Souldiers then he goes, him worthy they Deeme of the high estate, that giu'n they haue, And greetings glad, and warlick showts they pay, Which he receiues with countnance mildly graue: Thus when to showes of minds humble t'obay, And deere in loue, he sitting answere gaue: He points in field of scope muster to take, To th'ensewing day what force the camp can make. The sunne from out the east return'd againe So bright, and fairely lightsome, as but seeld: Wh? with the new daies beams came forth the traine, And vnder Ensignes splayd their weapons weeld, At Bullions hands ech seeking praise to gaine, Beyond his mates, whil'string they cast in feeld: Both horse and foote marshald in warlicke bands, Before him on do march, where firme he stands. Thou minde, of yeeres and of obliuion foe, Of what so is, guardaine and steward trew: Afford thy reasons helpe that I may showe This camps ech Captaine, and ech band to view: Let their old fame new sound, and ample growe, On which late yeeres the vayle of silence drew: Adorne my speech from out thy store to fet, What eu'ry age may heare, and none forget. The Franckes did muster first, of whom tofore Hugo had charge, a brother to their king. From Ile of France issewd this warlicke store, A soile faire, large, on foure streames bordering. When Hue deceast, th'ensigne that Lilies bore Of gold, Clotared still them conducting They followed, who Captaine great in fame, That nought might want, possest a royall name. Of complet armed they are hundreds ten, So many more of horse next them aduance, So like the first, as twixt them none may ken, In ordring, nature, armes, a variance: Normands they be, and Robert leades the men, Their natiue prince borne and bred vp in France. Their squadrons next William and Ademere, Two Pastors of the people mustred there. The tone and t'other of them who but late An holy office in Gods seruice beare, Now playted lockes pressing with cap of plate, Haue manly vse of armes falne to their share. Orenge Citie and confines of that state, Foure hundred warriours to the first do spare. The second those of Poggio doth guide, Equall in tale, nor lesse in value tride. Then Baldwyn makes his muster next in feeld, With Bulleyners tofore his brothers band, For his good brother them contents to yeeld: Now he on Captaines Captaine doth command: Th'ensewing roome th'Earle of Carnute helde, Mightie in counsell, valiant of hand. Foure hundred with him march, a treble force Vnder his Cornet Baldwyn leades of horse. Gwelfe occupies the bordring circuit, one Whose merit his high fortune egalleth, By Latine Sire, of Estine graundsires gone, A bedroll long and trew he reckoneth: But he vnto the great house of Gwelfon, Germayn in name, and Lordship succeedeth. Corinthia he rules, and neere the streames Of Rhine and Isther, Sweue and Rhetian realmes. To this liuelode that from his mother came, Conquests he winned, glorious and great: Thence brought he m?, who made (he bidding) game To march where death they were assur'd to geat: They winters cold by stooues to temper frame, And with inuitings glad pertake their meat. Fiue thousand came from home, but hardly tho He could the thirds (the Persians reliques) show. White skins, and yealow locks next people haue, Twixt Francks and Germans and the Sea bestowde, Where bancks oreflow doth Mose and Rhenish waue, Land that of graine and beasts, beares fruitfull lode: Eke Iland men, whom Oceans swellings braue, Gainst which they force vp rampires high &amp; brode. Ocean that not on wares alone hath power And ships, but townes &amp; kingdomes doth deuour. These that a thousand are and other are, Vnder another Robert make one band, A greater squadron is the British farre, Committed by their king, to Williams hand, His yonger sonne, their bowes these English bare, And people bring the pole that neerer stand. Whom Ireland placed at the worlds end, Doth from his wildwoods with locks shaggy send. Then Tancred comes, there's none amongst the rout (Regnald except) a brauer warrier, Nor of a stomacke noble more or stout, Nor countnance and conditions more faire, If cloud of blame wrapt his deserts about Them dimme, loues folly sole the fault must beare, Aboue twixt battailes borne, bred of short sight, Fed with afflictions, still accreeuing might. Fame tells what day the Francks with glory great, The Persian troopes discomfited in fight, After that Tancred in victorious heat Chasing those runawayes, was tir'de outright, Some cooly easefull place he sought to geat, For his scorcht lips, and lims deuoide of might, And drew whereas inuiting him to shade, Closde with greene banks, a fresh spring issue made. Vnthought of there appeares to him a Dame, All saue her face in complet armour dight: Shee was a Painim, and she also came Like rest to gaine in like betyred plight: Her feature he beheld, he held the same Most faire, he likes, his liking fire doth light. Of loue, O wonder! loue then scarcely bred Grew great, and flew and in armes triumphed. On goes her helme, and she th'assaylers part Had playd, saue others there by chance arriue: The haughtie Dame doth from her thrall depart, Who of sole force becomes a fugitiue: But he her warlike image farre in hart Preserued so as hit presents aliue. The chance, the place, how, wher she came in view, In restlesse thought still feeding flame a new. His looke was looke that did his folke to ware In letters large, he burn'd of hope deuoyd, So full of sighes he went, and so he bare His eye-lids vayled downe and sadly cloyd: Th'eight hundred horse which vnder-went his care, Campanias pleasant fields tofore enioyd, Dame natures greatest pompe, and hils that lay Mellow, fertill, woode by the Tirhene Sea. Two hundred followed of the Greekish tong, Who yron armour none in manner bring, Their hooked swords vpon the toneside hong, Their bowes and quiuers at their backes do ring, Their light horse seruice doth to gallop long, For trauaile tough, spare in their dyeting, Readie t'assayle and to retire at will, Disordred, scattred, fled, yet fight they still. Latine that Cornet led, and only he Of Greece the Latine armes accompanide. O shame! O foule misdeede! and had not ye O Greekes! these warres eu'n sticking in yourside? Yet (as at games) sluggards you sit to see What issue will to these great actes betide: Now if a slaue thou serue, this thy bondage (Doe not complaine) is iustice, not outrage. A squadron next there comes in order last, But first for honour, valure and for art: Inuict Heroick ventrers here are plaste, Asias terrour, and Mars thunder dart: Cease Argos, Arther cease, vaine shootes you waste, Knights saylers, and knights errants acts t'impart, For old exployts comparde with these are winde. Where shall we then for them fit Chieftaine finde. Dudon of Consa is their head, because Hard t'was of bloud and vertue doome to geeue, They all agree to vnder go his lawes, Who did of all know most, and most atcheeue, And graue of manlines and ripe of sawes: He showes in hoarie lockes of strength the preeue. He showes of wounds not foule the printed skarres, The worthy steps of honour wonne in warres. Eustace is next amongst the chiefe, whose owne Prayse makes him great, but brother Boglion more, From stocke of Norway kings eke Gernand growne, On Scepters, titles, crownes, him proud he bore: Roger of Balnauil mongst best is knowne: Old fame, and Eugerlan do there him score. Eke with the brauest they solemnize doo One Genton, one Rambald, and Gerards too. Vbald also, and Rosomond is praysd Of Dutchy great of Lancaster the heire, Nor can Obize the Tuscane downe be peyzd By him that memories away doth beare, Nor Lombard brothers three will be disseyzd, Achilles, Sforza, Palamede, of their Cleare fame, nor Otto strong that wonne the shield Where Serpents mouth sends forth a naked child. Nor Guasco nor Rudolfo left behinde, Nor th'one nor th'other Guido, famous both, Nor Eurard, nor Gernier must slip my mind, To passe in gratelesse silence more then loth, Whither do you louers and spouses kind? Gildip and Edward hale him, now that grow'th Of numbring wearie? O consorts in warre! Though dead, disioynd you neuer shalbe farre. What can there not be learnd in schooles of loue? There was she taught to waxe a warrier bolde, To his deere side still cleaues she, and aboue One destiny, his and her life doth holde: No blow that hurts but one, they euer proue, But ech wounds smart encreast is doublefold, And oft the one is hit the other playnes, Tone bleedes at soule, the tother at the vaynes. But youth Rinaldo farre surpasseth these, And passeth all that to the muster went, Most sweetly fierce, vp should you see him rayse His royall looke and all lookes on it spent: He hope oregoes, he ouergrowes his dayes, When bud was thought but bloome, out fruit he sent: To such as armes him thundring saw embrace, Mars he did seeme: Loue, if he shew'd his face. Him on the banck of Adige foorth brought Sofia to Bertold, Sofia the faire, To Bertold the puissant when newly rought From mothers teat, and yet vnwayn'd welneare, Maued would him haue, and nurst him, &amp; him tought In princely skils, and kept him still with her, Vntill his youthly minde plight his beheast, T'ensew the trump that sounded from the East. Then he thrice fiue of yeares could scantly skore, Yet fled alone and walkt through vncouth wayes, He past th' Egean Sea and Greekish shore, And at the campe arriues, where far hit stayes, Most noble flight, well worthy that once more, Some Nephew chiualrous make like assayes: Three yeeres are spent, and he in wars when now His chyns soft downe, could scarce a beard auow. The horsemen past, the muster next doth grow Of men on foot, and Reymond leades the way, Tholouse he rulde, and brought his souldiers fro Mount Piren, Garon streame, and Ocean Sea, Of thousands foure, well arm'd, well trayn'd, a show He makes, whom toyle or want could not affray: Tall were the men, and led they could not be By one more strong, or better skil'd then he. But thousands fiue doth Stephen from Amboise And Blois and Tours vnto the seruice bring: Though sorted bright in armes and weapons choice, For strength or paine not worth the valewing: The soyle is tender, light, shapte to reioyce, And like it selfe his dwellers fostering: In battaile first they giue an onsett bold, But soone waxt faint, and in their courage cold. Alcasto commeth third (as Thebes by Was Capaneus once) of visage grim: Sixe thousand Swizzers commons, fierce, hardy, From Alpine castles leuide come with him, Who yron wont to plowes and clots t'apply, To new shapes now and worthier vses trim. And with the hand that kept the ragged heard, Seemes kingdomes to defie, are not afeard. He after saw the loftie Standard splayd, With Peters Diademe and with his keyes, These thousands seu'n doth good Camillus lead, Footmen in armour bright, and huge of peyze, He glad the heau'ns so great a charge obeyd, There to renew his graundsires auncient prayse, Or shew at least that to valure Latine, Or nothing lackes, or onely discipline. But now the squadrons all in musters faire, Were marching on, and this of all the last, When Godfrey calles the greatest Captaines neare, And by his words gaue of his meaning taste: To morow when the dawning shall appeare, I will that light and prest the hoast do haste, So as vnto the sacred Citie we May come vnlookt, as much as much may be. Prepare you all both to the iourney than, And to the fight, and to the victorie, This hardie speech of so discreet a man Gaue ech one care, and vaunst his courage hie, All prest march on, when the first ray began To sprout, loth them broad day should there deskry, But Bollion prouident wants not his feare, Though close conceald it in his breast he beare. For he by newes, for certaine vnderstood Th' Egyptian king was now vpon his way To Gaza ward, a foretresse strong and good, Which frontier-wise to Sirian kingdoms lay, Nor could he thinke a man of restlesse mood, In high exploits, would trifle time away, But him sharpe foe attends: and sayeth this To Henryck a true messenger of his. Vnto some Frigate light get thee aboord, And toward Greekish soyle no sayling slake, There shall you meet (so haue I written woord, From one who newes of lyes will neuer make) A royall youth, none brauer guirt with sword, That part with vs in warre pretends to take: He is the Prince of Danes, and leades a band From where the Pole is Zenith to the land. But for the Greekish Emp'rour fraught with guile, With him perhaps will vse his wonted art, To turne him backe or bend his course the while, Farre off from vs vnto some forraine part: My messenger and counsler true as stile, Do thou in my behalfe dispose his hart, To our and his owne good, and bid him speed, For stay were now his most vnseemely deed. Come not with him thy selfe, but tarry there With Greekish king so to procure vs ayde, Which more then once he hath vs promisde faire, And by our league thus ought not be delayde, So speakes he, so informes, and giues to beare Letters, the which with greetings credence prayd. Henryck for speed, a present congey takes, And with his thoughts a truce time Godfrey makes. Th'ensewing day when of the lightsome east, The gates are opned to the Sunnes approch, The Drums and Trumpets gaue the eare no rest, Exhorting warriours on the way t'encroch, Thunder in heat is no such welcome guest, Which hope of nere showre to the world doth broch. As all the hardy souldiers pleasing found, Of warlicke instruments this shrilly sound. Straightway ech one pricked with great desire, Clothed his lims with his oft-worne spoyles, Straightway ech one musters in complet tire, Straightway ech one to his chieftaine recoyles, And the well-marshald army ioyned nyre His ensignes all displayes to Eols broyles. And the Emperiall Standard stately-large, A crosse triumphant ouer all doth charge. This while the Sunne, which in the heau'nly ground Still vauntage winnes, and vp ascendeth hie, On th'armour beates and flashes makes rebound, And quaking lightnings cleere, which bleare the eye: The aire with sparckles seemes enflamed round, And shines like burning fire that vp doth flie: And with the neighings fierce accordes the noyse Of clashing armour and the fields accloyes. The generall, who from the en'mies snares, Desires his troups in safetie may remaine, Store of light horse from the maine armie pares, And round to scoure the coast employes their paine, And Pioners to send before he cares, So for his campe an easie march to gaine, The pits to fil, the cragges away to take, And passages foreclosde wide ope to make. There are no Painim forces leauide yet, No walles enuironed with trenches steepe, No riuer broad, no combrous hill to get, No forrest thicke their voyage backe to keepe, Eu'n so the king of streames on priding set, When as he growes past measure high and deepe: Beyond his banckes abroad all wrackfull goes, And nought is found that dare it selfe oppose. Onely the King of Trypoli, who kept Within well guarded walles, coyne, men and armes, Athwart the Frankish army might haue stept, Yet durst he not by warre to stirre vp harmes: But he by presents to their fauour crept, And by his fires at home them gladly warmes. And such conditions of a peace doth take As vertuous Godfrey likes with him to make. There from Mount Seyr which vplifted hie, Neere to the Citie stands on easterne side Of true beleeuing wights a companie, Mingled in age and Sexe downe slocking hide, And Christens presents brought for victorie, And glad them view, and with them talking bide, Admiring vncouth armes, and to Godfrey They prou'd true faithfull guides to shew the way. He euer butting on the salt-sea waue, By wayes directest doth conduct his hoast, Well weeting that th'associat shipping haue, Resolu'd to sayle still hard aboord the coast, Which course vnto his armie plenty gaue Of vittaile, and what else was needfull most: For him ech Ile of Greece their haruest rept, And Creete and rocky Scio vintage kept. The bordering Sea vnder the waight did grone Of the tall ships, and of the lightest pines, So as safe passage there was open none In Midland Sea to any Saracines: For mand out not from Marck and George alone, In the Venetian and the Gene confines Came fleetes: But England, France, &amp; Holland some Do send, and some from fruitfull Sicil come. And these which now together are combinde With soundest knot of loue in one consent, At diuers shores had loden in ech kind What by the Campe should needfully be spent. So when the frontire coast they freed finde From en'mies shipping, which are close vp pent: With canvas spred at full they thither goe, Where Christ for mortall men bare mortall woe. But fame foreran, the ready carrier Of true reports, and rumours fraught with lyes, That safe is ioyn'd the army conquerer, And now sets forth and all delaying flyes, She of ech band, makes a perticular, She showes their names whose prayse doth highest rise, She showes their vaunts, and terrible of face Sions vsurpers ceasles doth menace. And ill lookt for perhaps brings greater ill, Then selfe ill doth, when it is present, beare, On ech vncertaine breath of rumour still Doubtfull hangs eu'ry mind, and eu'ry eare, Muttring confusde, within, without doth fill The fields, and dolefull Citie all with feare. But th'aged King neere perill of such losse, Counsels sauage in doubtfull hart doth tosse. Aladine is his name who of that realme Newe Soueraigne liued in continuall thought: A man earst cruell, but that mood extreame His riper age part had to mildnesse wrought: He that conceau'd whereat the Latines ayme, Who of his towne the walles to batter sought. To auncient feare adioyneth new suspectes, And dreads his foes, and dreadeth his subiectes. For in one Citie mingled dwellings fall, Of people contrarie in faith, the lesse And weaker part on Christ their Sauiour call: The great and stronger Mahomet professe. But when the king first conquer'd Sion wall, And there his seat to stablish did addresse, From common taskes the Painims he set free, And double lodes the Christians miserie. The thought of this his natiue sauage mood, Which couched lay, and languisht cold with yeares, Angring eneigres and it makes new wood, That thirst of bloud now more then aye appeares, So gentle seemd a while, the Snakish brood, That to his fiercenesse turnes as Sommer neares. And so the tamed Lion takes againe His natiue fury, if he wrong sustaine. I see, sayes he, of new conceiued ioy, Vndoubted signes in this vnfaithfull race: What their sole good that proues our chiefe annoy, Sole they do laugh in this our common case Of woe, and now perhaps their wits employ To guile and treason, and discourse apace, How me to slay, or to consorted mates, Mine enemies, how they may d'ope the gates. But soft not so, I will preuent (I trow) Their wicked purposes, I'le glut my will, I'l hew them downe, I'l sharpe examples show, I'l sucklings in their mothers bosoms kill, I'l fire in ech their house and temples throw, Such funerals shall their death rights fulfill: I'l offer on that Sepulchre of theirs, Their Priests for sacrifice amid their Preyrs. So did this tyrant reason in his mind, But thought so ill conceiu'd tooke no successe: Yet if these innocents a pardon finde, Base hart, not pittie doth him thereto presse. For if one feare to crueltie him tinde, Another greater doubt bridles no lesse. He dreads all wayes of concord to debarre, And armes of conqu'ring foes t'incense too farre. This fellon then his mad rage tempereth, Or rather seekes elsewhere the same to wrake, The countrey houses downe he ruyneth, And places well manur'd, a pray doth make To flames: Nought leaues he whole or so?d vnneath, Where any Franck may food or lodging take: The springs and brooks he soyles, &amp; waters sound With deadly poysons he doth all confound. He spitefull warie is, ne ought foreslackes Hierusalem with new force to supply, On three sides strong before no helpe it lackes, Onely the North part least assur'd doth lye, But from his first suspect the same he backes, On that his weaker flancke with rampires hye, And numbers great of Souldiers cul'd in haste, Hirelings and subiects by him there are plaste. The end of this first Song. THE SECOND SONG OF THE RECOVERIE OF HIERVSALEM. While thus the Tyrant doth prouide to arme, Ismen one day comes to him all alone, Ismen that from the Tombes can draw, and warme Life, breath, and sence giue corps whence they were gone: Ismen that by the sound of mumbled charme, Can Pluto in his Court cast feare vpon: And all his Diuels employ in charges bad, And bind, and looze, as if them slaues he had. Mahound he serues, that once did Christ professe, Yet former rites wholy can not forgo, But oft to vse of foulest wickednesse, Confounds both lawes, though wel he neither know: And now from caues where farre off common presse, He wonts in hidden arts his time bestow: He comes, in publicke perill of his Lord, To wicked king a Counsler more abhord. My Liege (he sayes) the Campe doth hither speede His march, that conquering hath so dismayd: But let vs do what vs to do may steede, The skyes, the world, will giue the hardy ayd. Tis well that Kings, and Captaines store at neede You haue, and for all wants foreorder layd. If that all other ply their charges so, This land for Sepulchre shall serue your foe. As for my selfe I come my helpe t'impart, Compagnion both of perill, and of paine, What counsell best lyes stor'd in aged hart, What Magicke skill I promise eu'ry graine. I will constraine to beare of toyle their part, Th'angels earst banisht from the heau'nly raine. But how I meane these my enchantments frame, And by what meanes, now will I shew the same. An altar hid in Christian Temple lyes, Lowe vnder ground and her caru'd picture there, On whom as Goddesse vulgar sort relyes, And mother that their bury'd God did beare, Wrapt in a vayle it is, nor euer dyes, The Lampe that shines before the image cleare. A long in rankes there hang hit round about, The offred vowes of credulous deuout. This Image now from them bereft away, I will that you transport with your owne hand, And in your great Meschita safe vplay, Then I by charme will shape so sure a band, That whiles it there doth dewly guarded stay, By it ech gate shall fatall fenced stand, Your Empire so twixt walles impregnable, This rare new secret shall make durable. He sayd, and swayd: then with impatience The King vnto the house of God him hyes, And forst the Priests, and voyde of reuerence, On that chast picture seyz'd in rau'ning wise, And bare hit to that Church, whereof offence Of fond and wicked rites prouokes the skyes: On sacred image in that place profane, Th'enchaunter whispered his blasphemous bane. But when new dawning peered in the sky, The Sexten who this Temple (most vncleene) Receiu'd in guard, the image cannot spy, Nor where he sought, nor where it plast had beene: Straight he enformes the king, whom egerly This so vnwelcome newes incenst with teene: And tooke conceipt t'was stolne by some of those, Who Christ profest, and now conceale it close. Were it the deede of some beleeuing wight, Or wear't the heau'n that here his power displayd: And for his Queene, and Goddesse tooke despight, In so vile place to see her image layd: (For fame as yet vncertaine doth endight, Where this, or mans, or Gods worke may be sayd) Godly it is that zeale and godlinesse, Of man giue place, and hit heau'ns deede confesse. The King doth cause with search importunest, Ech house, ech Church, view'd and review'd to bee, And him that hides, or maketh manifest The theese, or theft, proffers great paine, and fee: Th'enchaunter giues to all his arts no rest, To hunt the truth, but all in vaine hunts hee, Fr? where from heau'n or earth the practise came, Heau'n close it kept, to this Enchaunters shame. But when the cruell king saw vnespyde, That which he deem'd the faithfuls only feat, Gainst them a fellon hate he tooke, and fryde In wrath, and rage immoderate and great, Respect he quite forgets, what so betyde, Vengeance he'l take, and quench his furies heat: Th'vnknowen theese (sayth he) shall yet be slaine In common wracke, nor my wrath tane in vaine. So that the guiltie be not sau'd, let die The iust and innocent, but which is iust? Ech blame deserues, nor mongst them all see I So much as one, whom we as friend may trust: If some with this new fault haue none ally, It serues old faults abuy new penance must. Vp vp my loyals, vp in hand goe take Both fire &amp; sword, burne, &amp; huge slaughter make. So he his folke bespake, when forth ech where, Straightwayes this fame amongst the faithfull flyes, Who grew astonisht, so doth them the feare Of death in eye now present quite surpryze, Nor is there one that dew excuse, or preyre, Or iust defence, or flight, once dares or tryes. But these so faint, and vnresolu'd of mind, Where least they hoped, did their safetie find. Amongst them was a mayd of maidenhed To ripenesse growne, of high and noble thought: Of bewtie rare, but bewtie valewed, Or nought or sole, for it to vertue brought Accompt, most priz'd because straight cabyned, Twixt wals her prices great to hide she sought. And of her wooers vnbepranct and sole, Both from the laud, and from the lookes she stole. But guard is none that wholy can conceale, Bewtie of worth likt and admirde to be, Nor loue consent will giue, but it reueale Vnto a young mans hote desires doth hee, Loue that now blinde, now Argos, now with vaile Dost blind thine eyes, now open wide dost see, Thou through a thousand watchers into chast Maides lodgings others sight conueyed hast. Sofronia shee, Olindo he hath name, One Citie both, and one faith both they haue, For modest he, for faire she carries fame, Desire much, little hope, nought he doth craue, Nor can it show, or dares not do the same, And she or scornes, or seeth not, or gaue No semblance, so till then par thrall he peakt, Or not seene, or ill knowne, or smally reakt. This while runnes out the bruit, how there is prest A wretched slaughter of this seely flocke, Shee that is equall noble and honest, Bethinkes what way to shield them from the shocke, Valiance her great minde moues, shame it arrest, And maidens modestie doth thwart a blocke. Valiance orecomes, rather accordes, whiles she Shamefast her selfe, shame valiant makes to be. This maide alone through preace of vulgar went, Bewty she couers not, nor sets to sight, Shadow'd her eyes, in vayle her bodie pent, With manner coy, yet coy in noble plight, I note where car'de, or carelesse ornament, Where chance, or art her fairest countnance dight. Friended by heau'ns, by nature, and by loue, Her meere neglects most artificiall proue. Lookt on by ech the stately Ladie goes, But lookes on none, and to the King she came, Nor for he angry seemes, one steppe she slowes, But his grim sight fearelesse endures the Dame. I come my Lord, sayth she, (your wrath forclose The while I pray, and your people reclame) I come to show, and to you bound to gieue The wight you seeke, and did you so aggrieue. At t'honest boldnesse, at the vnforethought Glympes of her bewtie, stately, and diuine, As if confusde, as conquer'd he were cought, He bridles rage, and sterne looke doth incline, Had he a mind; or she a countnance brought Ought lesse seuere, loue had him snar'd in line. But wayward bewtie, wayward hart to moue Serues farre vnfit, kindnes is bait of loue. T'was stonishment, t'was rarenesse, t'was delite, If t'were not loue that stir'd his villaine hart: Declare (sayes he) the whole, no farder smite Shall any sword to Christen peoples smart: Then she here standes the guiltie of thy spite, This hand (O King) did play this theeuish part, Th'image I tooke away, and I am she, That so thou seekst, and punisht ought to be. Thus to the publicke fate her hautie hed She offered, and sole on her it tooke, Most noble lye, when so embellished, As thee t'exceede, can truth selfe euer looke? Suspenst a while and not so sodaine led To wrath, this Tyrant fierce patience forsooke, Then he reioyns thereto, I will thou show, Who did aduise, and who did helpe bestow. Of this my glorie I would not pertake One onely myte to any else (she sayd) My selfe I sole did hereto priuie make, My selfe sole counsaile gaue, sole gaue I ayde: Then on thee sole (he out replying brake) Shall all the wrath of my reuenge be layde: Tis iust (quoth she) to me it so pertaynes, At honour sole, sole will I be in paynes. Fresh rage in Tyrant then beginnes accrew, And asketh her: where is the image hid? Not hid (quoth she) but I in fire it threw, To fire the same most praysefull deeme I did: For so at least, that myscreants hands a new Might worke it farder wrong, all feare I rid. Seeke you the theefe, or seeke you (Sir) the theft, Her here you see, that aye from sight is rest. Albe nor mine is theft, nor theefe am I, Tis iust regayn'd, that wrongfully was got, The hearing this doth force the Tyrant gry, With threatfull sound, and raynes to wrath allot, Noble visage, hart shamefast, stomach hye, Now out may hope of finding pardon blot: And loue in vaine against so cruell wrake, Of deintie bewtie seekes a shield to make. Arrested, and condemned is that faire Dame, by that fellon King, in flames to die, And now her vayle and mantle chaste they teare Away, and with hard wythes armes tender tye, She silent stands, and still stout hart doth beare, No whit dismayd, though somewhat moou'd therby, And her faire face is taynted with a hew, That doth not palenesse, but a whitnesse shew. Now this great case is knowne, and thither packt Huge preace of people, and Olindo came, The person doubtfull is, certaine the fact, He came as deeming it might be his Dame, When as the prisner faire he found in act Not of accusde, but cast to be the same. And Sergeants busie bout hard office spide, Therewith he headlong shooues the presse aside. And cryes (O King) she is not guiltie, she Not of this theft, through folly vaunts she it, She thought it not, she durst it not, who see Did e're lone woman, and vnskild commit Such act? could watch by her beguiled be? Had she to steale the sacred image wit? If yes, tell how? my Lord, my selfe it was, So loue not louing loued he alas. He added then, I there where aire, and day, Your stately builded Meschite in doth let, By night vp clammer'd, and ech vncouth way Assaying, through that narrow hole did get, Mine only is this prayse, me onely slay You ought, nor she vsurpe my penall det, Mine are these chaines, for me you are too light, These flames, this pile, is nones but mine of right. Sofronia mildely lifting vp her sight, With eyes of pittie looketh him vpon, Whereto comest thou, O wretched guiltles wight? What counsaile, or what furie leades thee on? Or drawes thee foorth? without thee want I might, To beare the waight of humaine wrath alone? I eke haue hart that thinkes for once to die, It selfe can serue and craues no companie. She louer so bespake, but not dispose Him can, t'vnsay his words, or change his minde, Oh rare example where contention growes Twixt noble vertue, and a loue as kinde, Where winners onely price is life to lose, And harme of vanquisht is safetie to finde, But feller waxt the king that she and he, Ech to condemne themselues so constant be. He thinkes himselfe scorned by them to see, Who for despiting him, despise the paynes: Beleeue we both (he sayes) both I agree, Shall winne, but conquest such as best pertaynes: To Sergeants then he beckes, that readie bee The youth to binde with their prepared chaynes. Both to one stake they tye, and so them place, As backe to backe is turn'd, not face to face. Then was the pile fram'd vp about them round, And now the bellowes kindle ginnes the flame, When as the youth to layes of dolefull sound Brake, and bespake his fellow tyed Dame, Is this the cord I hoped should haue bound Vs two copemates of life? and is this same The fire I deemed should in ech our hart, An equall heat of equall flames impart? Flames other, other knots loue promised, But diffrent much, our hard lot doth prepare, Farre, ah too farre, it earst vs sundered, And bitter now conioynes in dying care, It likes me yet since I am destyned, So strange a death, this stake with thee to share: That bed I did not, thy fate sorrow I, And not mine owne, since by thy side I die. And oh most happy death that could betide! Oh fortunate these sweetest torments mine! If I obtaine that breast to breast allyde, My soule breath out into that mouth of thine, And thee with me, so deaths selfe instant guyde, As thy last sighes thou into me resigne, So sayd he playning, she againe replyes Sweetly, and with these words doth him aduise. Friend other thoughts, and plaints of other kind, For cause more vrgent this time doth require, Bethinke you of your sinnes, and call to mind What God he is, who good giues ample hire, Suffer for him, so paynes sweet shall you find, And glad to the supernall seat aspire: Behold how faire heau'n showes, the sunne behold You seemes t'inuite, and comforts to vnfold. The Painims lift their playning voyce aloft, And faithfull plaine, but in a lower sound, I wot nere what vnused earst, and soft, To kings hard hart, seemes hath a passage found, Him it foretels, and scornes, nor will be broft To bend, but turnes his eyes, and left the ground, Thou sole Sofronia dost not pertake This common dole, nor plaint dost playned make. In such their plight a Knight comes ryding loe, (For so they ghesse) of goodly woorth and port, Whom stranger by the armes and tire they tro, That from farre parts, now thither made resort: The Tygre which on helme for crest doth show, Drawes on ech eye, as badge of rare report, A badge in battaile by Clorinda vsde, They thinke it's she, nor is their thought abusde. Of womens fashions and their vsuall guise, Eu'n from her greenest yeares she takes disdaine, Proud hand doth with Arachnes worke despise, With Spindle, or with needle it selfe to staine: Gay clothing, and close cabbanes eke she flyes, For goodnes eu'n in fields may safe remaine: She armes with pride her looke, and holds a bent, Sterne it to make, yet sterne it doth content. Tender as yet with daintie hand she straines, And slips the raines vnto some courser braue, She handles speare, and sword in armes she traines, Enduring breath, and lims enur'd to haue: Then through the wildest woods, and on mountaines Chase to the Lions fierce, and Beares she gaue, She warre ensewes, in which, and in forreasts, Men sauage her, man her deeme sauage beasts. From Persian Realmes she hither iourneyed, That Christens to her power resist she may, Albe tofore their members scattered She had in fields, and mixt their bloud with sea, Now here arriu'd, first sight was offered Of those, who debt to death were prest to pay, Willing to see, and know what fault did force Them to such end, she forward spurres her horse. The preace giues place, she doth some stay pretend, The tyed paire more neerely to suruay: She markes t'one silent, t'other sighes out send, And sexe lesse strong more courage to display: She sees him wayle, as one that pittie bends, Not dole, or dole not for himselfe doth sway. And silent her, with eyes so fixt on sky, As parted hence, she seemes before she dy. Clorinda moody grew, and griefe doth take For both their sakes, and teares her visage taint, Yet more bemones her that no mone doth make, The silence moues her more, lesse the complaint: Without long stay a man she thus bespake, Whose haire old age did with new colour paint, Ah tell me what are these, and to this death What fate, or fault of theirs them conducteth? So him she prayd, and he short answered, But full exprest what she to learne was bent, She wonders much, and soone imagined, That both these wights were equall innocent: Straight to forbid their death she purposed, So farre as prayre, or force could make extent, She nyres the flame, she bids take it away, (That fast approcht) and doth to Sergeants say: Not one amongst you once so hardy bee, This office hard, yet harder to pursew, Till with the King I speake, and trust you mee, This lingring shall none your annoyance brew, The Sergeants yeeld, as moued much to see, That her so stately port, and royall hew, Then to the king she goes, and met him there Midway, he going likewise towards her. I am (quoth she) Clorinda, you my name Perhaps haue heard, and for defence Of our beliefe, and of your raygne I came Like prest for ech exploit, do you dispence What I shall vndertake, I neither shame The base, nor dread of highest daunts my sence, Will you in open field, or will you vse My seruice closde in walles? I none refuse. She peac'd, what land so wide, the king replyes, From Asia standes, or from the course of Sunne, Where (glorious maide) thy honour great not flyes, Or where thy fame hath not arriuall wonne, Now that thy sword his edge with mine allyes, My feare is past, and comfort is begunne, Not if an armie great my part should take, My hope more sured could that army make. Now now, me seemes, Godfrey beyond his dew Protractes the time, and where you please, demaund Employd to be, sole fit I deeme for you Exploytes, where hazard hath most honour pawnd, To you the charge of all my martiall crew I here assigne: tis law what you commaund, So spake the king, she courteous money payes, Of thankes for prayse, and then thus farder sayes. A strange case may it seeme to ech ones sense, That seruice vnperform'd should guerdon haue: Your bounty yet me cheeres, for recompence Of seruice ment, those two condemn'd I craue: Though if the fault do want sure euidence, T'was cruell reason that such iudgement gaue: But this I silence, and I silence signes Expresse, through which their innocency shines. I only say ech one holdes vaine to doubt, That Christians haue this image stolne away, But from you I dissent, ne am without Sound reason, whereon this my gheasse I stay: Th'enchanter, who this practise went about, A pranke vnreu'rend gainst our law did play, It not beseemes to make our Church a neast For Idols, and for others Idols least. To Mahound rather I impure aboue This straungy myracle, and he it wrought, To shew into his temples did behooue, No new defilde religion be brought: Let Ismen his enchauntments vtmost prooue, He that in stead of armes with charmes hath fought To handle steele is of vs Knights the scope, This is our trade, this is our only hope. This sayd, she ceast, and though an irefull hart To pittie hardly can be drawne, yet would The King her gratifie, and reason part Perswades, part sway of her intreatie could Him moue, haue they of life, and freedome mart, (Quoth he) no nay, finde such an asker should. Be it pardon, or be it iustice dew, Guiltlesse I quit, guiltie I giue them you. So were they looz'd of all haps happiest, The fate was certes, that Olinda prou'd: What act could show that in a noble brest, Loue in the end another loue hath mou'd? From stake to wedding goes he, Spowse addrest, Of one condemn'd, not sole of louer lou'd: He would with her haue dyde, her will doth giue, Since with her he dyde not, with him to liue. But this suspitious King doth parlous iudge, So great vnited vertuous neighbour-hed: And giues straight charge that both to exile trudge, Beyond the bounds that Iury lymited: Then following his earst resolued grudge, Some faithfull he confines, some banished: Oh! how the auncient syres, surpryz'd with woe, Their tender younglings, and sweete beds forgoe. (A seu'rance hard) he driues them sole away, That strong of bodie, and are stout of mind, But pawnd as hostages, doth force to stay The milder Sexe, and weaker yeares behind: Many went wandring, some the rebels play, Wh? more then feare could quench, anger doth tind. These ioynd with Frankes, and them encountered, Selfe day when they Emaus entered. Emaus is a Citie, which small space Doth from royall Hierusalem depriue, And he that for his pleasure walkes soft pace, Parting at morne, may there at nine arriue: Oh! how to Frankes this newes seemes full of grace, Oh! how their longing doth to hasting driue? But for the Sunne was now from South declinde, The Captaine there to pitch his tents assignde. And pitcht they were, and Phebus fostring light, From Ocean was remou'd but litle space, When two great Barons in strange vesture dight, And of a port as strange approch in place: Their fashions framed to a peacefull plight, Witnesse of Captaines friends they beare a face: Ambassadours from great Egyptian king, They come, and store of Squires, and Pages bring. Aletes is the one, from worthles rabble Mongst basest commons dregs who vp did spring: Yet him to kingdoms highest honours able, Did these: a speech, fly, currant, carrying Fashions pliant, demeanure variable, In faining prompt, skilfull in cousening: A biter at the backe by such quaint wayes, As when he carpeth most, he seemes to prayse. The tother is Circassian Argant cald, Who stranger first, did court of Egypt haunt, But now is mongst th'imperiall nobles stald, And may of martiall chiefe preferments vaunt: Vntreatable, vnpatient, vnappald, In armes linelesse, and peerelesse valiaunt: Despiser of ech God, alike as one That law and right sets in his sword alone. These crauing audience, straight vnto the fight Of famous Godfrey, by admittance drew, Whom on low seat, and in meane vesture dight, Sitting amidst his Coronets they view: But very valure, though in recklesse plight, Doth to it selfe sufficing grace accrew. Argant a signe but slight of honour sparde, As one of great estate, and small reguarde. But right hand layd Aletes on his brest, And bow'd his head, and cast to ground his eyes, And honour'd him in eu'ry sort at best, As of his nation can import the guise, Then he began, and from his mouth sweetest Riuers of eloquence flow hony-wise. And for the Frankes, now Sirian speech had learnd, That which he sayd, was perfectly discernd. O worthy sole, whom deigne may to obey This famous troup of ech Heroicke Knight, Who conquests past, &amp; Realmes that now they sway, Knowledge as your, and your aduices right, Within Alcides boundes your name to stay Brookes not, but eu'n mongst vs takes farder flight, And fame hath through ech part of Egypt spred The tidings cleare of your great manlihed. Nor of so many any one not lent, (As men to maruailes vse) hath listning eare, But them, my king, not with astonishment Alone, but with like great delight doth heare, And glad in their report oft time hath spent, Louing in you, what they enuy and feare. He loues your valure, and doth free elect With you to ioyne in loue, if not in sect. So faire occasion him doth onward guide, With you of friendship and of peace to treat, And that ech sure may rest to other tyde, If faith cannot, let vertue worke it yeat: But for he learnes, you force of armes prouide, His friend to chase from out his royall seat. He chose ere any farder harme might growe, We should you make his mind at full to knowe. His mind is this, if pleasde you will remaine, With what the warre already yours hath made, Nor Iury seeke, nor th'other parts t'obtaine, Which he with fauour of his raigne doth shade: He promise plights you to assure againe, Your yet not settled rule, if double blade Of yours be ioynde, the hope is out of date, For Turkes or Persians to regaine estate. My Lord, great things in smal space haue you wrought Which in obliuion long age cannot cast, Armies, Cities vanquisht, destroyd to nought, Wayes earst vntrode, distresses ouerpast: So by your fame to fright, and stoyning brought Are Realmes about, both farre and neerely plast. And though more kingdomes rest as yet to gaine, To gaine more glory you aspire in vaine. Your glory highest top hath wonne, tis dew Henceforth you fly of warre the doubtfull chaunce, By winning you can onely state accrew, But no way more your glory ought aduaunce, Where all is lost that earst you did subdew, And honour too, if Fortune looke askaunce: Tis game of Fortune, fond and bold away, Gainst small vncertaine, certaine much to play. But somes aduice, whom it perhaps imports, That others farder conquests theirs assure, And end to ech attempt that lucky sorts, And that instinct which feruent doth enure, High flaming harts to more and more efforts, Whereby thral'd people may their yoke endure: Will (peraduenture) make you fly as farre From hauing peace, as others do the warre. They will exhort you to ensew the way, That is by fate so largely opened, And not aside this famous sword to lay, Whose edge hath conquest still ascertained, Till Mahounds sect be brought to full decay, Till Asia be quite abandoned: Sweete things to heare, entrappings very sweet, Which yet not feel'd extreamest dammage meet. But if that courage blindfold not your sight, Nor in you darken reasons clearest ray, You shall perceiue in making choice to fight, Well feare of much, but little hope you may: For Fortune here below oft changeth plight, While haps now good, now bad do ioy or sray, And those who ouer high and hasty flye, To steepest downefals come the sooner nye. Tell me if to thy dammage Egypt rise, In gold, in armes, in counsell great of might, If Persian, Turke, Cassans sonne likewise Conspirde in one, hap to renew the fight, What force gainst such a fury can suffize? What place giue scape to such a parlous plight? May be you on the Greekes lewd king affie, Whom sacred league of cou'nants doth allie. Who knoweth not in Greeks what faith there raines? Yet by one treason ghesse the residew, Nay by a thousand, for with thousand traines Brewd hath your bane, that myser faithlesse crew, Then who to stop your passage earst tooke paines, Prepares he now his life to spend for you? Who bare high wayes common to all that liue, Denide, will he his proper bloud you giue? May be you placed haue your hope alone In bandes, of which this circuit maketh showe, And whom disperst you vanquisht, knit in one, Now eke assoone to ouercome you trowe, Though of your troopes that store is scald and gone Through wars and want, your selfe do see and knowe. And though new foes against you still encrease, Egyptians, Persians, Turkes, a hugy prease. But as thing fatall grant we this pretence, That neuer weapon shall your force subdew, Graunt that the heau'ns thereof giue euidence, And as your selfe expound, so be it trew, Yet famine shall you vanquish: what defence? What refuge gainst this ill (for God) haue you? Against this set your launce in rest, go trie Your sword, and faine your selfe the victorie. The fields about burnt and destroy'd to nought, Hath the inhabitants fore-seeing hand, And to closde walles, and to high turrets rought, And stowd their fruites ere you approcht the land, Now you that (hardy) haue them hither brought, Whence hope you feede, ech foot and horsed band? You'll say our Nauy shall vs vittailes send, And doth your liuing then on windes depend? And doth your fortune then commaund the windes? And bind and looze them, as you best may please? The Sea whom ech at plaints, and prayers findes, Still deafe, sole heres it you? sole you obeyes? Or when a league the Turke, or Persian bindes With warlicke force of ours, then cannot these Assembly make of such a mightie fleete, As is t'oppose against your Nauie meete? My Lord, a double victorie you neede, If you expect the honour of this warre, Whereas one onely losse will doubtles breede Great shame to you, but dammage greater farre, For if then yours, our Nauie better speede, Foorthwith in Campe you hunger-starued are; And if your losse light on the land, in vaine Your shipping shall a fruitlesse conquest gaine. Now if in this estate you yet refuse A peace and truce with great Egyptian King, (Pardon the truth) to other your vertues This your counsaile is no way answering: But heau'ns vouchsafe that newer thoughts you chuse If old liktwarre, and diuers end they bring, That Asias waylments so take breath at last, And of your conquests you the fruit may tast. Nor you, who of the perill and the paines, And of the glory are with him consort, Be not so farre mis-led by fortunes traines, That to new warres she powerfull you exhort, But like the Pilot, who from sea, where raignes Mis-hap, hath brought his ship to wished port: So strike you now the sayles you hoysed hie, And do no more in ruthlesse flouds affie. Aletes peac'd, his speech doth straight ensew, A murmur soft of that Heroicke race, And well their actions disdainefull shew, How much against their bent his tale did trace, The generall about him castes his view, And his lookes thrice or fouretimes in the face, And then his eye on tothers countnance stayd Who answere did attend, and thus he sayd. Your Kings message sweetly you haue exprest, Part with a milde, and part with threatfull grace, If I in loue, or deedes in price doe rest With him, t'is kind, and I his loue embrace: But where (Ambassadour) you do protest Vnited warre of Painims in this case, I answere will, as still mine vse affordes, Franke senses in as single meaning wordes. Know that till now, thus much we suffered At sea, on land, by day, and in the night, Only a way to haue recouered, To sacred walles of most respected sight, That merit might with God be fauoured, Of freeing them from such hard thralled plight: Nor can he grieuous seeme for so good end, This worldly honour, life, and raigne to spend. For no ambitious bent or couetise To this exployt edgde on, or vs addrest, Purge from our breasts, O father of the skies, So dismall plague if it in any nest, Ne suffer it may spread infecting wise Sweete venom, which bids death, as pleasures ghuest, But let his hand that hardest harts gently Doth pierce, them both vnstone and mollifie. This hand vs raysd, this hath vs forwardded, From perils vs, from vs remouing stayes, This playnes the hils, and dries ech riuers bed, The Summers heat and Winters cold allayes, Calmes flouds of Sea, with tempests billowed, This fast and loose with windes in Lybume playes: From it are highest walles pierst and reuerst, From it the armed rankes slaine and disperst. Courage from it, from it our hope doth breed, Not from our forces, frayle and tyred out, Not from our Nauie, nor from those, whom feed Doth Greece, nor from the armes of Frankish rout, Let that not faile, nor vs forsake at neede, All other wants we lesse then nothing doubt, Who knowes how this defends, and how it strikes, Like this no succour for his perill likes. But if through secret iudgement he denie, Or for our sinnes the aide from him we craue, Who ist of vs will there a buriall flie? Where earst our God his bodie layd in graue? Die will we, nor the liuing ought enuie, Die will we, nor our death vnuenged haue, Nor Asia shall at our mischance reioice, Nor ours our death, mone with one wailing voice. Thinke not that we flie farre from peacefull ease, As mortall warre-men fled and feared see: Much would the friendship of your king vs please, Nor with him to ally ought grieuous bee, But where or no, Iury his rule obeyes, You know, why then thereof such care hath hee? Strange Realmes to winne let him vs not gainesay, And his safe, glad, in peace long mote he sway. So answer'd he, and this his answere knowne, Pearst Argants hart with pricking furious, Nor it conceald he, but with lips vp blowne, Forth to the Captaine steps, replying thus: Who list not peace, warre take he as his owne, For store of brawles was neuer penurous: And well you show that farre from peace you flie, Since our first speech you cannot pacifie. Then by the edge he doth his mantle take, He bowes it, plaites it, reacheth towards him The plait, and to these farder speeches brake, More then tofore, of visage spitefull grim, O thou that scorne of hardest brunts dost make! I peace and warre bring in this plaited brim, Thine be the choice, thy selfe well counsell now, And stailesse take, which thou dost best allow. At this fierce act, and speech they all betooke Themselues to call for warre, conioyn'd in cry, Nor stay could for their noble Chiefetaine brooke, That Godfrey in his owne words might reply: He fell vnfolds the plait, and mantle shooke, And sayd, to mortall warre I you defye: He sayd it in so fierce and fellon sort, That seem'd he op'ned Ianus Temple port. Seem'd he the plait op'ning, thence haled came Besotted rage, and discord cruellest, And in his skowling eyes bigge torches flame, Of hags Alecto and Megera rest, That Giant earst, who raysd that loftie frame Of errour gainst the heauens, may such be ghest: And in such semblant him saw Babel great Vaunce vp his forehead, and the starres to threat. Godfrey adioynes, now to your King resort, And bid him come, and bid him hast a pace, For we except your threatned warres effort, And if he come not, looke he in short space For vs at Nyle, in milde and gratefull sort, Them licence giue, and with choice guifts them grace He doth, Aletes hath a helme of price, Which mongst the bootie he had wonne at Nice. A sword he Argant giues of gold and stone, The hilts and pommell wrought so curiously By workmans skill, that valew there is none In that rich substance, if with forme it try, When his long busie sight had skand vpon The temper, richnesse, trymming thoroughly, Argant to Bolleyn sayd, soone shall you newes Heare, how your guift I haue the skill to vse. Then leaue receiu'd he to his fellowe spake, Now will we ech of vs a diuers way, I to Hierusalem, you t'Egypt take, You with new Sunne, I with the nightly ray, My letter or my presence nothing make, Ought needfull whither you are faring may: Beare you the answere backe, hence I depart Will not where is of armes proclaymd a mart. Thus of a messenger he growes a foe, Be it a timelesse, or a ripened hast, Where law of Nations he offend or no, Or old vse breake, no doubts he list to cast, Answere not reakt, friended by silence so Of twinckling starres, to those high walles he past, Brooking no stoppe, the t'other eke that stayd, What ere might linger, makes as ill apayd. Now was it night, when in deepe rest enrold Are waues &amp; windes, and mute the world doth show Weari'd the beasts, and those that bottome hold, Of billow'd Sea, and of moyst streames that flow, And who are lodgde in caue, or pend in fold, And painted flyers in obliuion low, Vnder their secret horrours silenced, Stilled their cares, and their harts suppelled. But neyther faithfuls Campe, nor Francks Chieftaine Betake themselues to sleepe, nor t'ease apply, So much they long to see once shine againe Th'expected gladsome dawning in the sky: That it may show the way, and guide the traine To towne, where doth of their great passage lye The bound, now and now prying if there peere One ray, or darke of night beginne to cleere. The end of the second Song. THE THIRD SONG. Dawnyng th'Embassadresse was ris'ne from bed, Tydings to beare, how now grey morne annies, The whiles she trimmes her selfe, and golden hed Beflowres with Roses culd in Paradize, When from the Campe to armes which buskelled, Doth voice of murmur shrill and loftie rise, And Trumpets blast preuents, Tr?pets now found Then earst, more cherefull &amp; more cleare of sound. Th'aduised Chieftaine with a gentle bit Guideth, and seconds their so bent desire, To turne the course more easie seemeth hit, Of winding waue that rouls Caribdis nire, Or Boreas when at Sea he ships doth slit, Or scoures Mount Penine backe to make retire. He rancks them, leades them, &amp; alone them swayes Swiftly, but swiftnes such as order stayes. Winges to ech heart, winges to ech heele are tide, Nor his so speedie march the Souldier knowes, But when the Sunne with glowing beames had fride The chapped fieldes, and now to height arose: Behold Hierusalem t'appeare is spide, Behold Hierusalem ech finger showes, Behold in one a thousand voices meete, And all Hierusalem are heard to greete. So hardy ging of Marriners forth blowne, In venture to deskry some straungy shore, Who in wild Seas, and vnder Pole vnknowne, Proue waues deceitfull, and windes faithles more: If eye at last the coast desirde can owne, With glad showt gre'th it, their approch tofore, And t'one to t'other showes it, and forgets Old noyse, the while and all ore passed lets. To pleasure great which sight thus first affixt, Did breath most sweetly into eu'ry brest, Succeedes a deepe contrition, that doth mixt With fearefull, reuerend affection rest, Scarce dare they looke vp now and then betwixt, To towne which Christ as his choice bowre possest. Where he deceast, where he was buryed, Where he with limmes himselfe new parrelled. Lowe accents, silent words, broken sobbings, And fearefull sighings of this warlike rout, Mingling at once both ioyes and sorrowings, A murmur make whirle in the aire about, As in thicke forrests heard are soft whistlings, When through the bowes the wind breathes calmely out: Or as amongst the rockes, or neere the shore, The driuen waue doth hisse and hoarsely rore. Bare footed ech, him to the way addrest, For Dukes example mooues the residew: Trimming of silke or gold, proud plume, or crest, Not one there is, who not from head withdrew: All do their hearts of stately thoughts deuest, And cheekes with skalding teares deuout embrew: Yet as to plaint foreclosed were the way, Ech gainst himselfe doth this accusall lay. Then where thou with a thousand streames, O Lord, Bloody didst leaue the earth besprinckelled, Of bitter plaints at so grieuous record, Least wise two quicke-springs now can I not shed, O frozen hart! these eyes that hast not gord, And into drops of teares thy selfe melted! Hard heart of mine why splintst? why breakst not thou? Wayle motst thou aye, if thou waile nothing now. This while one in the Citie, who descries Both hils and plaines, an high Towre guarding there Markes from below, a dust vpward to rise, So as it seemes great cloud to print in aere, It seemes that cloud lightens and burnes in guise, As flames and flashes it did childing beare, Then he the shining of the mettall cleare Discernes, and tryes both men and horse appeare. And loud he cryes, O what a dust I vew, Spread in the aire! Oh how it seemeth bright! Arme, arme to your defence you Citie crew, Ech speede to armes, and to the walles you dight, The en'my comes, and then he cryes anew, Ech one make haste, ech furnisht be to fight: The en'my (see) is come, the dust behold, Vnder yon horrid cloud the sky to fold. Then seely children, and vnarmed old, And womens rout of feare ypaled hew, To strike or fend, who can no weapons hold, Sad and suppliant to ech Meschite drew: The rest more firme of lims and stomacke bold, Tofore on backe hasty their armour threw: Some runne to gates, and some vnto the wall, King goes about, and sees and carkes for all. He order giues, and then retires them fro, Where twixt two gates a Turret doth arise: So neere he is at neede, and thence more low, The playnes and mountaines round about he skries, With him he would there should Erminia go: Erminia faire, whom he in courteous wise Receiu'd to Court, when Chistian squadrons gaine Did Antioch, and King her Sire was slaine. This while Clorinda gainst the Frankes is hide, Store with her goes, and she before them all, But at a posterne gate on t'other side, Argant for reskons stands at readie call: The noble Dame her followers affide, With words and with a looke that scornd to pall: By some braue onset, vs behooues (quoth she) This day the hope of Asia founded be. While she her men bespake, not farre she spyes A band of Frankes their rusticke prayes driuing, Who coast for bootie skourde (as is the guyse) Were now to Campe with flocks and heards turning, She towards them, and towards her there hyes Their Captaine, who her saw to him comming: Gard is the Captaine nam'd, a mightie man, But might not such as her resist he can. This fierce encounter Gardo ouerthrowes In sight of Frankes, and Painims on the plaine, Who all one outcry made, so lucky showes This token of the warre, yet proued vaine, Then with the rest in spurring gins she close, Her hand the price from thousand hands doth gaine, Her men her follow, by the way she made Plaine with her shockes, and open with her blade. Soone from the prayer she doth pray retake, The troope of Frankes now step by step retire, Till on the top of hill a stand they make, Where place to armes, new forces gan acquire: Then as a tempest doth resoluing crake, And from the clouds downe falles the airy fire: Good Tancred so at Godfreys bidding prest, His Squadron moues, and maine yard doth arrest. So strong great launce he beares, and in such guyse This youth comes on, both fierce and faire in sight: That King who from aloft his port descryes, Him deemes amongst the best a chosen Knight, And sayes to her, who in next seat him nyes, And now her hart feeles in a panting plight: Through so long vse you may to me declare Ech Christen, though in armes they closed are. What then is he that doth so seemely frame Himselfe to iust, and so fierce semblance beare, Vnto the Ladie for an answere came, On lips a sigh, and in her eyes a teare, But breath and weeping backe she doth reclame, Though so as yet they make some muster theare, For her swolne eyes, a purple circle faire, Tainted and hoarse halfe sight brake forth to aire. Then sithens she contriues, and seekes to hide Another longinge vnder cloke of hate, Alas I know him well, cause doth betide, Why mongst a thousand I should know his state: For oft the fields, and oft deepe dikes I skride, Him fill with bloud of vassals mine of late: Ah how in striking fell he is? to wound He giues in herbes, or spels no helpe is found. The Prince Tancred it is, ah once that hee My prisner were, but yet aliue, not sleine I would him haue, that fierce desire in mee Of sweete reuenge might so some comfort geine: This sayd she, and her words by hearers bee Wrong turned from right sence, as she did meane. And this last speech a mingled sigh out brought, Which to suppresse, but all in vaine she sought. Tancreds assault this while Clorinda plyes T'encounter, and in rest her Launce bestowes: Ech t'others beauer hits, the splints to skyes Vp start, and she in part disarmed showes: For buckles broke, foorthwith the Helmet flyes From off her head, (a blow whence wonder growes) And golden lockes vnto the wind displayd, She midst the field appeares a youthly mayd. Her eyes do flash, her lookes do lighten bright, Sweete eu'n in wrath, in laughter then what grace They hold? Tancred whereon thinkst thou? thy sight Where bendst thou? knowst thou not this noble face? This is that visage faire whence thou in light Flames burnst, thy hart (her pictures shrine) the case Can show, this same is she whom quenching thirst At solitarie spring thou sawest first. He that of painted shield, and of her crest Tooke earst no keepe, now seeing her doth grow A stone, she bared head couers, as best She may, and him assayles, he gets her fro, And fell blade whirling makes against the rest, Yet at her hand peace cannot purchase so: But threatfull him pursewes, and turne she cries, And to deathes twaine at once she him defies. Stroken this Knight, no strokes againe replyes, Nor so from sword himselfe to guard attends, As to regard her cheekes and fairest eyes, From whence his bow, loue vneschewed bends, T'himselfe he sayes, ech blow vnharmefull dyes, Which force of her right hand (though armed) lends, But neuer blow from her faire naked face Falles vaine, but in my heart findes lighting place. Last he resolues, though pitty hope he none, As louer hid, not silent to decease, That she her prisner strikes, to her make knowne He will, trembling, vnarm'd, sewing for peace, And sayes, O thou, that for thy foe alone Seem'st me to take among so great a preace: Let vs forsake this thrust, so may aside My force with thine, thy force with mine be tride. So better shall be seene if my prowesse Thine counteruaile, she th'offer not gain-said, And as she were of wanted helme recklesse, Forth bold she goes, on followes he dismaid: Now to the combat had this warriouresse Plighted her selfe, and on some blowes now laid, When he sayes stay, and of the fight lets make The cou'nants, ere we vs to fight be take. The stops and him of fearefull earst, hardy Now makes, a loue conuerted to dispaire: The cou'nants are (quoth he) since so you fly, All peace with me that out my hart you teare, My heart, no longer mine which glad will dy, If of his farder life dislike you beare: Long time it hath beene yours, now time is fit The same you reaue, forbid I may not it. Behold mine armes downe held you I present, Fencelesse my brest, why stay you it to cleaue? Will you dispatch the worke? now, now content Of curets go, if corps that bare I leaue, You bid Tancred with threedes of more lament, His woe (poore wretch) perhaps preparde to weaue: But presse vntimely that still fast arriu'd, Some his, some Painims farder time depriu'd. The Palestines by Christens chaced, gan Giue ground, were it for guile, or were it feare, When of the chacers an vnmanly man Wau'd by the wind, skrying her sparckled heare, Lifts vp his hand as at her backe he ran, And where she naked show'd, stroke at her there: But Tancred cryed out thereof aware, And with his sword that great blow off he bare. Yet all in vaine not lights, but on the bound Her hitt, twixt whitest necke and fairest hed, And her beguiled lockes this slightest wound, With some few drops, such wise betainted red, As gold growes ruddie, which (some rubyes ground By skilfull workeman set) doth sparkles shed: But furious grew this Prince, and onward made Against this villaine, and drew out his blade. T'other avoides, and wrath enkindled hee Pursewes, they go through aire as arrow-fares, Suspenst, she stayes a while and both doth see, Now parted farre, nor them to follow cares: But backe retires with those of hers that flee, And now showesface, nor Frankes t'assaile she spares, Now turnes she, now returns, now fight, now flight She makes, nor chac'd, nor chacer term'd aright. Right so fierce Bull sometimes in market place, If hornes to dogges he turne, from whence he fled, They there retire, and if to flight he pace, Ech makes returne to chace emboldened: At backe Clorinda (whiles she flight doth trace) High holds her shield, and guards thereby her hed: Defenced in Monseo pastimes so, From balles against them throwne, the flyers go. While these pursew, and those pursewed fly To the high walles, they now approching drew, When on the sodaine with a ghastly cry Vpraysde, backe on them comes the Painim crew: First wheeling farre aloofe, then turning ny, At backe and sides return'd they fight renew: Meane space Argante downe the mountaine led, His band t'assault them also on the hed. The fierce Circassian from the troup out went, That his blow first the enimy might gall: And whom he strooke he topsie-turuie hent To ground, in plumpe both man and horse withall: And ere his launce was into shiuers rent, Many claim'd fellowship in th'others fall: Then drawes his sword, and where it home doth come, Still killes or felles, or least-wise woundeth some. Clorind his countermate of life reaued Ardelio strong, who farre in yeares did creepe, But of old age, as yet vnmastered, And fenst by two bigge sonnes, who safe him keepe Could not, for from his fathers care sundred Th'eldest Alcandro was, by wound full deepe, And Poliferno who neere him abid, Could scarce and scarce himselfe from perill rid. But Tancred when he could not ouer-get That villaine, who his horse had swifter pac'd, Lookt backe and saw his hardy men had fet Too farre a course, while sole headlong they chac'd: He saw them hemd, he spurres to courser set, Turning the raynes, and thither speedes in haste: Nor he alone brought succour to his band, But eke that troupe which made for neede a stand. That troup aduenturer which Dudon led, Heroicke flowre, the Campes sinewes and might, Regnold shapt fairest, noblest couraged, Fore-runnes them all, lightning takes slower flight, Erminia soone his port, soone th'azured Shield had deskryde with siluer Eagle dight: And sayes to King that on him fixt his eye, Ther's he that beares on brauest masterye. For trenchant blade he hath of equall prize, Or few or none, yet but a child in age, If but such sixe were mongst our enemies, Ere now had Syria stoupt to seruiceage, Ere now had neighbour-realmes, where Sun doth rise, And Realmes that Southmost lye, endur'd bondage: And Nile perhaps in vaine, from yoke should hide His head farre distant, nor as yet deskride. Regnold he's called, and his wrathfull hand More then all engines force the walles do feare, Now turne your eyes where I am pointing, and Mark him whose armes green with gold mixed beare, That's Dudon, and by him is led this band, This band which hath to name th'Aduenturer: A warriour who well borne and well expert, Exceedes in yeeres, nor wanteth in desert. That great one seene with blacke becouered so, Gernand he hight, brother to Norway King, A prouder man the whole earth cannot shoe, This sole the price of his acts shadowing, Those two, who thus in one conioyned goe, And parrell white, white haue their furnishing, Gildip and Edward loues, and spouses are In loyaltie, and martiall prowesse rare. So spake she, and they saw downe on the plaine, How slaughter still encreaseth more and more, For Tancred and Reynold brake through the traine, That thicke of men and armes enringde tofore, And then the band which Dudon led, amaine Comes in, and on them likewise chargeth sore. Argant, Argant himselfe at shocke such wise, Reynold orethrew that scant he could arise. Nor had he ris'ne perhaps, saue that the horse Of Bertolds sonne, that instant tooke a fall, And hauing vnder-caught his foot, did force For plucking it thereout some stay withall: The Painim troupe this while seekes to endorce, Defeated, flying, chac'd the Citie wall: Sole Argant and Clorinda bancke and barre, Gainst fury that at backe orefloweth, are. Last rancke they guard, &amp; brunt at heeles some space, Vpon them makes a stay, and is represt, So as those folke with lesse endaunger'd case Might fly, who first to flight themselues addrest: Dudon fierie through victorie giues chase To flyers, and the fierce Tygran opprest, With shocke of horses &amp; then with drawne blade, His body headlesse kisse the ground he made. Nor Algazzar good of tough Corslet tooke, Nor mightie Corban of his strong Helmet, For in the nape and backe them he so strooke, That wound to face and brest did passage get: And by his hand eke their sweet lodge forsooke, The soules of Amurate and Mehemet, And of fell Almansor, nor great Circasse, One step by him can vnannoyed passe. Argant frets to himselfe, and est he makes A stand, and turnes, and then retires againe, At last so suddaine turnd, to him he rakes, And rought his side with a reuerse so maine, That deepe the blade it bathes therein, and takes Life by that blow from Frankish Capitaine: He falles, and eyes that scarce could open looke, An yron sleepe, and hardest quiet tooke. Thrice he them opens, and the heau'ns sweete rayes Sought to enjoy, and on his arme arose, And thrice he fell, and his eyne ouer-layes A darkesome vayle: in th'end weari'd they close, His limmes dissolue, dead, cold, a sweat displayes, And sensibly a sencelesse stifnes growes, Vpon the corps (now dead) no longer stay Fierce Argant brookes, but hies forth on his way. Yet for all that though going keepe no stay, He turn'd to Frankes, and (O ye Knights) he cride, This bloudie sword is that, with which the day Last past your Lord in guift me gratifide: Tell him how now thereof I tooke assay, For glad he would this newes be certifide: And deere must take it that his Present faire Is knowne by proofe, so great a worth to beare. Tell him henceforth account he looking make, In his owne guts the same more sure to proue, And if t'assaile no ouer speede he take, I'le come vnlookt, be he the ground aboue: The Christians angred at so fell a crake, From all sides with all hands against him moue, But mongst the rest he was too safety ronne, And for his guard had wall befriending wonne. The guarders busie, straight themselues addresse, To haile downe stones aloft from garrets so, And with such fast supply the numberlesse Quiuers with arrowes stuffed eu'ry bow, That to retrait forst is of Frankes the presse, And Saracins into the Citie go. But Reynold now from groueling horses side, His foot out hauing pluckt, was thither hide. He came on the Barbarian homicide, A sharpe reuenge for Dudons death to take, And being come to his, aloud he cride, What looke you for? what lingring ist you make? Since slaughtred lies the Knight that was our guide, Why running haste we not his death to wrake? In so great cause of iust displeasure can A brittle wall thwart vs a stoppage than? No not if double ire or Adamant, This walling high not to be pierced were, From higher prowesse yours, that fierce Argant With begged safetie should him neastle there: Goe we vnto th'assault, and selfe instant, Before the rest (so said) first doth he steare, For his vndaunted courage ought affright, Nor arrowes showre, nor storme all stony might. He tossing his stout head lifts vp his face, Full of so terrible an hardiment, That to the hearts of those, who guard the place, An ycy cold of feare vnwonted went: Whiles some he cheeres, and some he doth menace, In commeth one, who slakes his eger bent: For Godfrey to them sent the good Sigiere, Of his graue charges messenger seuere. Who in his name their ouer-hardinesse Vncries, and straight to turne doth straight impose, Returne he sayes, for to your wrathfulnesse Nor place serues fit, nor season tidie growes, Godfrey commaunds it you this word expresse, Regnold now raines, who earst was spurre to those: Though inward much he frets, and out reueald More signes then one of anger ill conceald. Backe turne the bandes, nor their returne at all Was by the counterwayting foe distrest, Nor Dudons corps of his last funerall, In any portion did defrauded rest: Vpon their kindest armes his friends loyall Him beare, a burden deere and nobellest, Bulleyn the while viewes from an higher part, Of that strong Citie both the site and art. Hierusalem vpon two hils is set, Of height vneuen, and turnde front to frount, His middle part a lowly vale doth fret, Which it deuides and t'one from t'other mount, Three sides are coasted with a combrous let, Fourth easie way, nor to ascend they count: But with high raysed walles it selfe defends, The playner part which gainst the North extends. Within the Citie sundry Cesterns are, Raine to receiue, and brookes and liuing springs: Without the earth about of grasse is bare, Fountaines or lakes (barraine) none forth it brings: Nor is it seene gladsome, or proud to fare With trees, nor yeelds gainst Suns rayes shadowings: Saue where some sixe miles off a wood vpgrowes With noysome bugbears, that dark ghastly showes. That side where rising first appeares the day, The noble waue of happy Iordan flankes, And on the westerne part of Midland Sea, It buts vpon the sandy strowed bankes, The North Betel (to golden calfe, where they An alter raysd) and eke Samaria rankes: Bethlem is plast where South brings showry cloud, Whose hap was earst in lap great birth to shrowd. While Godfrey now both of the towne, and land The loftie rampires, and the site surueyes, And him bethinkes where best his campe may stand, And where foes weakest wall t'assaile with ease, Erminia skryes him, and with stretched hand Him points to Painim King, and farder sayes: That Godfrey is, who clad in purple pall, Beares port so king-like and maiesticall. He (certes) borne seemes a Soueraigne, So th'arts to rule, and to command he knowes: Nor is he meaner Knight then Capitaine, But all the points of double valure owes, Nor man more warlike this so great a traine Mongst all then him, nor more aduised showes: In counsell Raymond sole, and sole in warre Reynold and Tancred his coegals are. The Painym King replies, him well I beare In minde, as earst seene at great Court of France, When I Egyptian messenger was there, In noble iusts I saw him ply his launce, And though his yeeres, which then young springing were, No tire of downe did on his cheekes aduaunce: Yet both his words, &amp; workes, and semblant braue Of greatest hopes eu'n then foretoken gaue. Foretoken ah too true, with that troubled Ey-lids downe clines he, then them reares anew, And sayes, tell me; whats he coat-armoured, Whom weare, and t'others match to march we vew, Oh how by this he is resembelled! Though seemes to want a part of stature dew, Thats Baldwyn answer'd she, to him showes he, Brother by face, but more by facts to be. Next marke the man on t'other side in guize, That stands of one who counsaile doth endite, He Reymond hights, whom I to you for wise, Did so commend, a man all hoary white, Skild to contriue more warlicke policies, Theres neither Frankish nor Italian sprite, But he that with guilt-helme doth farder stand, Good William is, Kings sonne of Brittish land. With him is Gwelfe and equall striues to goe, In braue deedes, in great bloud, in high calling, Full well by those square shoulders him I knowe, And by that breast whole cheasted vp rysing, But mongst these squadrons mine owne greatest foe (Though wide I looke) to sight I cannot bring: I meane that Boemund, that murderer, Of my bloud royall cruell rauiner. So talked they, the whiles the Capitaine, When he the walles had viewd, to his descends, And for he deemes the Citie should in vaine Assault receiue, where steepenesse most ascends: Against the Northerne gate, he on the plaine, That with it ioynes, his pitched tents extends: And thence proceeding neere the towre below, Cald Angolar, the rest he doth bestow. The circuit of the Campe might neere comprize The Cities third part, or but little lesse, For to enclose it round the same suffize At full could not, such was her hugynesse: But all the wayes (at least) which might supplyes Afford, Godfrey to stop gan him addresse: And causeth to be seiz'd ech passage fit, That seru'd to come, and go too and from it. A charge he giues his Tents should fortefide With diches deepe, and with strong trenches bee: Which it from Townesmens sallyes on th'oneside, And straunge assaults might on the tother free: Then after these dew workes to end were hide, Dudons carcasse he tooke a mind to see, And thither went where that good Captaine ded, With sad and tearefull troupe was compassed. His faithfull friends adorned his great Beare With noble pompe, where plast aloft he lyes: When Godfrey enters, and the people reare More dolefull playning and more tatling cryes, But with a looke nor troubled nor yet cleare, Good Bulleyn bridles his affects, and tyes His tongue, then when his sight on him had stayd, Fixed in muse somewhile at last he sayd. To thee nor plaint, nor dole are dew, for death, If world thee sent, heau'n giues thee birth againe, And here where off thou threwest thy mortall sheath, Steps of thy glory printed deepe remaine: Thou liu'dst as Champion of the Christen faith, And so thou did'st, now ioyest thou, and faine In God dost feede thine eyes, O soule of blisse, And crownd, and palmd thy well deseruing is. Blessed liue thou for our condition, Not thy mis-hap inuites these teares to fall: Sith at thy parting parts a portion Of vs, most worthy and most strong withall: But if from vs an earthly aide is gon, Depriu'd by that, which death the vulgar call: An heau'nly aide for vs thy suit may gaine, For mongst th'elect thee heau'n doth entertaine. And as we saw for our aduantage thee, Earst mortall man, these mortall armes to weeld, So (sprite diuine) our hope assures to see, With fatall armes of heau'n thou wilt vs sheeld: Learne now the prayers to receiue which wee Thee send, and succour to our euils yeeld: Thence conquest I denounce, deuout we will Triumphant vowes at Church to thee fulfill. So spake he, and by this the Euening darke Had quenched all the rayes of lightsome day, And with obliuion of ech noysome carke, Did truce on teares, and on lamentings lay: But Godfrey warlicke engins want doth marke, Which vnsupplide, t'were vaine the wals t'assay: He casts where beames to get, and how to make The engins frames, and small rest can he take. Vp with the Sunne he rose, and follow will Himselfe the pompe of solemne funerall, To Dudon at the foot of rysing hill, A Sepulchre of Cipresse sweete they stall, Their Barricados neere, and highest spill Of Palme tree, with his boughs orespreads it all: There was he layd, the whiles the Priestly throng, Rest to his soule do pray for in their song. Amongst the boughes, where hang'd vp here &amp; there Ensignes, and prisond armes of diuers sort, From Syrians and Persians that were Earst wonne by him, with better sped effort: The armes and curets which he vsde to weare, Did cloth the tronke, and tronke did them support: Where after was ygrau'd: Here lyes Dudon, Yeeld honours dew to this braue Champion. But godly Bulleyn hauing brought to end This worke so dolorous and so deuout, The Carpenters of all the Campe doth send, With souldiers conuoy to the forrest out: It lyes twixt valleyes hidden, and a friend Of Syria made it knowne to Frankish rout: March thither they to cut downe engines take, Gainst which the Citie no defence may make. Ech on his mate to fell the plants doth call, And gainst the wood to worke vnusde outrage, Hewne by the yrons piercing edge, downe fall The sacred Palme-trees, and th'Ashes sauage, The Maples, Pines, the Cipresse funerall, High Firres, Beeches, and Holmes of thicke bowage: The husband Elmes, to which the vine sometimes Leanes, and with wrythed foot to heauen climes. Somes strokes in Ewes, somes are in Okes enchac'd, Which haue a thousand times their lockes renewd, And thousand times (at ech encounter fast) The wrath of windes repulsed and subdewd: And some on ratling wheeles the burdens plac'd, Of Ornes and Ceders with sweete sent imbewd: At sound of armes, at diuers cry the beasts, And birdes forsake their caues, and fly their neasts. The end of the third Song. THE FOVRTH SONG. Whilst on so faire exploytes they bend their mind, Which to effect vse may employ with haste, He that graund foe was aie to humaine kind, His wannish eyes doth on the Christians cast: Whom for they ioyfull and contented find, Both lips through rage he champs, and gnaweth fast: And his fell griefe, as some begoared Bull, Roaring and sighing, out he belkes at full. Then hauing tossed ech deuise in braine, Which might the Christians wrap in wretched case, He giues commaund that gathred be his traine: (A ghastly Senate) to his royall place, As t'were, O foole, attempt of easie paine, Against the will diuine t'oppose thy face: Foole, that compares with heauens, and forgeates How Gods incenst right hand doth th?der threats. The dwellers of th'eternall shades he calles, By hellish trumpet of hoarse iarring sound, At such a dynne the wide darke vaulted walles, All quake the misty thicke aire gan rebound: Nor whistling so the flash downe euer falles From vpper regions of the sky to ground, Nor shogged earth so euer bideth throwes, When bigge in wombe she doth the vapours close. The Deities of the deepe from all about, In diuers troupes soone meete at t'haughty gates, How strangy shapes them (oh) how vgly clout? What dread, what death in their fell eyes amates? With sauage insteps some the soyle bestrout, With lockes of wrythed snakes some tire their pates: A Dragging hugy tayle their croupper bindes, Which as a rod oft foldes and oft vnwindes. There thousands vncleane Harpyes might you vew, And thousands Centaures, Sphinges, Gorgons pale, And gulsfy Scillaes an huge barcking crew: There Serpents hisse, and Hidras whistle bale, And sootie sparckles vp Chimer as spew: Eke Gerions, Poliphems an vgly tale: And in new monsters not earst heard or seene, Confusde and mixt in one hewes sundry beene. Part on the right, part on the left this band Siedgeth it selfe, their wreakfull king before, Pluto sits in the mids, and with right hand His rusty waightie Scepter vp he bore, Not rocke in sea so much, nor cragge at land, Nor Calp or Atlas great high vaunceth more: Yea matcht with him they but as hillockes shoe, So his great front, so his great hornes vp goe. In his fierce looke an horred maiestie Encreaseth terrour, and more proud it makes, Ruddy his eyes and plaguefull venomy: His countenance as lucklesse Comete flakes, A beard bigge, bushy, knotted gristelly: Fr? wrapped muzzle down his rough bosom strakes, And as a gulfe where bottome none is vewd, He yawnes his iawes with clottie bloud embrewd. Like as the sulphure fumes encroaching flame, And stinke, and thunder vp from Etna steeme, From his fell mouth such blacky belches came, And such the sent, and such the sparckles seeme, The helhounds barcking (while he spake) became Silent, his voice mute made men Hidra deeme, Cocytus flowed backe the deepes appall, When his loud roarings to these speeches fall. You hellish powres, whose birth-right shold aduance, High boue the Sun your there deserued troane, And whom from realmes so blest that great mischance Earst to this ghastly denne with me hath throwne: Both others old suspects and fierce vengeance, And our braue on-set ouer well are knowne, At pleasure now on starres empyreth he, And we as rebell soules condemned be. And in the liew of faire and clearest day Of gold-bright Sunne, and of the faring starres, In this darke depth he vs confines to stay, And from aspiring to earst honour barres, Then (ah this thought how heauie doth it way: This tis which sharpely wounds a new my skarres) To those faire heauenly seats he man hath cauld, Vile man from vilest durt on earth ycrauld. Nor this suffizde, but did his Sonne betake In pray to death to worke our greater skath, He came, and downe th'infernall gates he brake, And in our kingdomes durst new tread a path, And fetcht the soules which lot our owne did make, And so rich spoyles to sky conueyed hath, Triumphant victour, and vs to vpbrayd Of vanquisht hell, th'ensignes he there displayd. But why do I by speech reuiue my woe? Who hath not earst told of our wrongs the skore? Where was the place? or who the time can shoe? When euer he his vsed prankes forbore: Our thoughts no longer backe to th'old must goe, But cast to cure more then one present sore: Ah! see you not hither his drifts to fall, That eu'ry Nation on his name may call? Shall we still sluggards then waste day and howre? Nor any worthy carke our courage wake? And shall we brooke that hourely greater powre His faithfull people may in Asia take? That Iury he subdew? that his honour, And that his name more large and great he make? That other tongs it sound? that other verse It write? new brasse and marble it reherse? That all our Idols downe to th'earth be throwne? To him our alters by the world turned? To him the vowes vp-hangd? to him alone All incense burnt? gold and mirrhe offered? That where to vs earst closde was temple none, Now to our artes no way rest opened? That of so many soules the wonted pay Ceast? and an emptie Realme Dan Pluto sway? Ah be it farre, of that first woorth as yet In you the sprites quite are not vnder brought, When round with steele, and haughty flames beset, Against celestiall empire earst we fought, We could (I not deny) no conquest get, Yet valure did adorne so great a thought: Be what it will that victory him gaue, Of hearts inuict we yet the glory haue. But why thus linger I? oh you my crew! Goe trusty on. oh you my power and might! Goe hastie on, and these caitiues subdew, Ere their stoupt forces rise to higher flight, Ere whole consumed be the Realme Hebrew, Of this encroaching flame quench out the light: Amongst them preace, and to their vtter harme, Now heds with wiles, now h?ds with forces arme. My will shall dest'ny be disperst, let some A wandring walke, let slaughter some vprake, Let some with carkes of fond loue ouercome, A sweete glance, a coy smile, their Idoll make, Let weapons some against their leader clomme, Let them grow mutinous, and parties take: Let Campe with losse, and ruine be accloyd, And eu'n his markes rest with it selfe destroyd. Gods rebell soules stay could no longer barre, That these last words might sort vnto an end, But flying foorth a new to view ech starre, From their deepe plunged might abroad they wend, Much like the stormes of broylly whistling iarre, Whom natiue caues foorth from their intrayls send, To darke the welkin and a warre to band, Against the great Realmes, both of sea and land. Full soone to sundry coasts with wings displaide, These thorough the world made their diuers starts, And of entrappings straunge, and new they laid, Sly framed plots, and gan apply their arts: But of their first annoyes (O Muse) me aide, To shew how source they tooke, and from what parts, Thou wotst it well, fame brings thus farre vnneath, Of so great workes to vs a feeble breath. A famous noble wisard Hidraote Ruled Damascus, and the Cities neere, Who from his youth to arts of vncouth note Addict, did day by day them more endeere: But whereto booted this, if they ne mote Of these vncertaine broyles the issue cleere? Nor of the fixt or wandring starres th'aspect? Nor hels swart cunning could to truth direct? His iudgement led, ah blindest humaine minde! How vaine and wrested wrong thy iudgements are? That to the Campe of westerne armes combinde The sky sole death, and ruines did prepare, So deeming Palme for this attempt assignde, Should in the end fall to th'Egyptians share: He sought a portion on his people might, Of victory and gaines, and glory light. But for Frankes valure high he holds in price, And harmes of bloody victorie doth feare, He casts his penworths by some queint deuice, The Christians force peecemeale-wise to impaire, So as them downe more easly at a trice, His and th'Egyptians armes vnite may beare: In this conceit the Angell blacke him neeres, And more him pricks, &amp; more him onward steeres. He counsell endeth, and affords the meanes, Which may to this exploit giue easie passe, There dwelt a wench whose peereles bewty steines Ech easterne Ladie, and his Neice she was: The cunningst spels, and fardest fetched treines, Of witch or womans skill well couth the lasse: He her doth call, he her of counsell makes, And vnto her the whole charge he betakes. My deere he sayes, who vnder golden haire, And with a looke so delicate in show, Dost aged wit, and manly stomacke beare: And in mine owne skils farre my selfe outgo, Thy seconding my huge conceiu'd affeyre, Will to our hopes cause glad successes flow. Weaue thou the web begun by my deuice, Of warie age as bold executrice. Goe to the en'mies Campe, and there employ Ech womans wild, which loue may serue to slocke, Let plants with prayres bedewd beare sweet alloy, Let broken wordes with deepe sighes entershocke, Let dolefull bewties pityed annoy, Winne to thy will eu'n harts of stiffest blocke: Thy too much boldnes shadow vnder shame, And cloke of truth vnto thy leazings frame. Catch (if it may be) Godfrey with the traine Of thy sweete lookes, and of thy speeches faire, That warre begun, the mans besotted braine May loath, and it diuert some other where: If this faile others of the greatst enchaine, And leade where all returne they may despeire: Then he his counsels sorts, and endeth thus, For faith and countrey nought misseemeth vs. The faire Armida priding in her hew, And in th'endowments of her sexe and age, This charge takes on her, and as eu'ning drew, Doth part, and to close wayes her steps engage: Stout harts she hopes, and arm'd hands to subdew With her tresses, and wenches equippage: But of her parting diuers tales are spred By set deuice, t'amuze the peoples hed. Within few dayes this Dame her iourney ends, There where the Frankes their large pauillions spred, Whose bewtie rare at his apparence lends: Babling to tongues and eyes a gazing led, As when some Starre or Comete strange ascends, And in cleere day through sky his beames doth shed: They stocke in plumps this pilgrim faire to vew, And to be wizde what cause her thither drew. Not Argos, Cyprus, Delos ere present, Paternes of shape, or bewtie could so deere, Gold are her lockes, which in white shadow pent, Eft do but glimpse, eft all disclosde appeare, As when new clensde we see the element, Sometimes the Sun shines through white cloud vncleere, Somtimes fr? cloud out gone his raies more bright He sheads abroad, dubling of day the light. The winde new crisples makes in her loose haire, Which nature selfe to waues recrispelled, Her sparing looke a coy regard doth beare, And loues treasures, and hers vp wympelled, Sweete Roses colour in that visage faire, With yuorie is sperst and mingelled, But in her mouth whence breath of loue out goes, Ruddy alone and single bloomes the Rose. Her bosome faire musters his naked snow, Whence fire of loue is nourisht and reuiues, Her pappes bitter vnripe in part doe show, And part th'enuious weed from sight depriues: Enuious, but though it close passage so To eyes, loues thought vnstaid yet farder striues: Which outward bewty taking not for pay, Eu'n to his secrets hid endeeres a way. As through water or Christall sound the ray Passeth, and it deuides or parteth not, So piercing through her closed robe a way, His daring thought to part forbodden got, It roameth there, there true it doth furuay, Of so great maruailes part by part the plot: Then to desire it tels, and it descriues, And in his breast the flames more quicke reuiues. Eyed and praysd Armida past the while Through the desirefull troupes, and wist it well, But makes no show, though in her heart she smile, And there deseignes of spoiles and conquests swell, As thus some guide she craues with doubtfull stile, For her safe conduct to the Coronel: Eustace her meetes, who claymes a brother-hed In him, that chiefe those armed forces led. As Fly at flame, so he about turned At the brightnes of this bewtie deuine, And neere those lights to view he coueted, Whom modest fashion sweetly can encline, And cought great flame, and close it fostered, As neered tinder doth the sparckle shrine: And to her sayd: for hart and hardiment The heat of yeares, and loue vnto him lent. Lady, if you at least so base a name Beseeme, who nothing earthly represent, Nor euer skyes on daughter of Adame, Of their faire light so large a treasure spent. What ist you seeke? whence is it that you came? What fortune yours, or ours you hither bent? Make me know who you are, make me not misse To yeeld you right, and do what reason is. Your prayse too loftie mounts, she answering sayth, Nor to such height our merit can arriue: You see one Sir, not subiect sole to death, But dead to ioy, onely to woe aliue: My hard mis-hap me hither carryeth, A pilgrim mayden poore and fugitiue: I seeke good Godfrey, and in him affy, Such fame about doth of his bountie fly. Doe you to Captaine mine accesse obtaine, If kinde and courteous (as you seeme) you be, That to the one the t'other brothers paine You guide, and him entreat tis meete, quoth he, Faire maide you haue not made recourse in vaine, Nor in the meanest grace he holdeth me: At your best liking all is yours to spend, What so his Scepter, or my sword may frend. He ends and guides her where good Bulleyn stald Twixt Worthies great, stolne from the vulgar was, Lowly she bendeth, and with shame appald, No word from out her lips could winne a passe: But those blushings the Champion recald To boldnes, and from feare assurde the lasse; So as conceiu'd harmes she vnfoldes at last, With tune which senses in sweete fetters cast: Victorious Prince (she sayd) whose greatest name With so rich furniture adorned flyes, That Kings and Countries, whom subdew and tame Thou dost in warre it as their glory prayse: Well is thy valour knowne, and as the same Is lou'd and praysd eu'n by thine enimies: So it affies, and them inuites againe Aide at thy hands to beg and to obtaine. And I borne in a faith so wide from thine, As it thou quaylst, and now seek'st to oppresse; Yet hope by thee that noble seat of mine; And parents royall mace to repossesse: And where kynnes, and others to craue encline Gainst strangers fury, which workes their distresse: I, since in them dew pittie beares no stroke, Against my bloud mine en'mies armes inuoke. On thee I call, in thee I hope alone, In height (whence I was thrown) thou canst me place Nor ought thy right hand show it selfe lesse prone, Me to vp-rayse, then others to abase, Nor yet lesse prayse doth vaunt of pittie owne, Then when triumphant thou gieu'st en'my chace: And as thou couldst their realmes from many rend, So mine restord will equall glory lend. But if our diuers faith perhaps thee moue Mine honest prayre to scorne, let faith profest Sole on thy pitie to relie approue My suit, twere hard it should deluded rest, Witnesse (O God) like good to all aboue, Your iuster aide to none was euer prest: But that the whole may in your knowledge fall, Here my mis-haps, and others fraudes withall. I daughter am to Arbylan, that raygn'd On faire Damascus, though of meanely race: But he Cariclia faire to spowse obtain'd, And she him graced with th'imperiall mace: On her fell death well neere the mastry gain'd, Ere I had birth, for she did it embrace, As I forsooke her wombe, one fatall day Doth death to her, and me to life conuay. But the fifth yeare had scarce fulfild his date, From time that she her mortall vayle off threw, When as my father yeelding vnto fate, In heau'n perhaps with her allyde anew, Leauing the charge of me, and of the state To brother, whom he bare a loue so trew: As if goodnes in mortall breast remaine, He might be sure of his true faith againe. He then thus to my gouernment ordaynd, Of my well-doing mustred such a care; As price and prayse he wanne of faith vnstaynd, And of a fathers loue and kindnesse rare; Weart that his inward thought with malice staynd, Then vnder other cloake conceyld he bare; Or that his will as yet iust meaning led, Because he ment me with his sonne to wed. I grew, and his sonne grew, but neuer ought Of knightly parts, or noble artes he reakes, Nothing thats rare, no gentleman like thought Buside his head, nor too much wit it breakes, Vnder deform'd shape he a mind of nought, And proud hart bare, addict to gluttish freakes, In clownish acts, and fashions such an elfe, As sole for vices he could match himselfe. Now my good guardein, with so braue a mate In wedlockes bondes resolues me fast to knit, And him of bed, and of my royall state Consort to make, and oft he told me it: He vsde his tongue, and traines he vsde his pate, That wisht effect might to his purpose fit: Yet could he neuer me to promise sway, But sowre still held my peace, or gaue a nay. At last he parts with looke darke clouded so, As cleere there through his fellon hart shined, And well the story of my future woe, In his forehead (me seem'd) I written red, Then were my night rests, when to couch I goe, With strange dreames still and bugbeares troubelled, And in my soule a fatall horrour pight, Was of my harmes a halsner ouer right. My mothers ghoast did oft it selfe present, A paly image, and of dolefull plight, Alas! how farre from that hew different? Which elsewhere purtrayd earst had pleasd my sight: Fly daughter, fly thy now, now imminent And cruell death, (she sayd) make speedy flight: I see (loe poyson) to thy wracke preparde By the fell tyrant, and his weapon barde. But what auaylde it; ah! that such presage Of neering perill warning gaue my mind, If that surprizde with feare my tender age, All vnresolued could on nothing bind, My flight to wilfull exile to engage; And naked leaue my natiue Realme behind: So grieuous seem'd as lesse I reckoned Eyes there to close, where first I opened. Alas! I feared death, and yet (who ere Wist of the like) had not the hart to fly? A frayd I was eu'n to disclose my feare, Least haste might life sooner to death affy; So restlesse and turmoyld my dayes out weare In neuer ceasing martyrdome did I, Like him that lookes ech stond with bared necke, When cruell axe shall his liues warrant checke: In such my state, were it my friendly hap, Or that for worse, me on my destny led, One, whom in Court, eu'n from his mothers lap, In neere seruice my father vp had bred, To me bewrayes that of my fatall clap Approcht the time, by tyrant limited, And that selfe day he promisde had the beast By poysoning me to complish his beheast. And farder addes, that of my running dayes, I onely could prolong the course by flight: And since I hopte for aide none other wayes, Prompt his owne paines vnto my helpe he plight, Whose comforts so my drooping courage rayse, As bit of feare lost his restrayning might: And I resolu'd that night with him to go, Flying mine Vnckle and my Countrey fro. Vprose the night more darke then wonted was, Whose well befriending shadowes vs protect, So safely foorth with damsels twaine I passe, For my downe fallen fortune mates elect, But backe to Countrey walles mine eyes, alas! Bayned with teares, I turning oft direct: Nor euer of my natiue soyle the sight, Me throughly satisfie at parting might. The eye and thought both walked backe that way, The foot much gainst his liking forward went, Like ship from loued shore, where safe it lay, Which some fierce sodaine storme hath wrackful rent, That night we farde, and all th'ensewing day, Through couerts where step earst was neuer bent: And to a Castle we arriu'd at last; Vpon the confines of my kingdome plast. Aront the Castle ownd, Aront his name Was, who me drew and kept this perill fro: But when the traytour saw the deadly frame Of his wiles falne, and me escaped so, Kindled with rage his owne deserued blame, On our two backes he labours backe to throw: And vs to charge with that mis-doing sought, Which he himselfe against me wold haue wrought. He sayes how Aront I with guifts did bribe, To spice his cup with iuyce enuenomed, That he once gone, none might thenceforth prescribe A law, or raine my will vnbridelled; And then would hoyting wanton to a tribe Of loues my body haue abandoned; Ah! first let flame from sky on me descend, Sacred vertue, ere I thy lawes offend. That hungry teene of gold, and thirst withall Of mine vnharmefull bloud her sell hath cought, It sorely grieues, yet more my hart doth gall, That my cleere honour he to blemish sought, The wretch whom feares of peoples brunt appall, With such embellishment his leasings wrought, That doubtfull of the troth, and in suspence, The towne rose not in armes for my defence. Nor for he now is stalled in my seate, And on his crowne my royall Crowne doth shine, An end vnto my shame and harmes so great, His still on pricking fiercenes will assigne: But Aront in his fort to burne doth threat, Vnlesse in prison vp himselfe he shrine; And to my consorts, and poore soule to me, Not warre, but wracks, and deaths denounceth he. This he pretends to do, as if he thought, So from his face to wash away the shame; And to restore dew place, whence I it rought, To th'onour of my bloud and princely name: But feare it causde, least Scepter might be cought, Him fro, I being true heire to the same: For onely if I fall, a setled stay Plant on my ruines for his rayne he may. And eu'n such end will iump with fell desire, Whereto the tyrants mind is fully bent, And by my bloud shall quenched be his ire, Which at my teares would neuer yet relent: If thou let not, to thee I fly (O Sire) A wench, a wretch, orphane, and innocent: Let this plaint, which mine eyes shed at thy feet, Vayle me that bloud from vaines not also fleet. By these legs which the proud and lewd down tread, By this hand which assisteth aie the right, By thine high victories, and by the aide, Thou hast, and dost those holy temples plight, Do thou my suit, that sole art able, stead; Let both to life, and Realme thy pittie dight: One helpe for all yet voyde let pittie bee; If right and reason also moue not thee. Thou whom the sky graunted, and gaue in fate To will whats iust, and what thou will t'obtaine, Mayst saue my life, and winne thy selfe a state, For thine it shall be, if it I regaine, Ten onely Champions of the brauest rate, I seeke to cull amidst so great a traine: For with my fathers friends and subiectes trew, The'yll serue to roost me in my nest a new. Yea more one of the chiefe, whose loyaltee With guard is trusted of a secret port: It promiseth by night to d'ope, and mee Into his pallace let, and doth exhort That only some small aide I begge of thee; And thereon more rely for sound comfort: Then if I had huge troup of other freakes, So much thine ensigne, and sole name he reakes. This sayd, she peac'd, and his answere attends, In act which silent doth both speake and pray: Godfrey his doubtfull mind tossing suspends Twixt diuers thoughts, ne wots which side to sway; He dreads Barbarians wiles, and well comprends; Man findes no faith where God receiues a nay: But t'other side a milde ruth him awakes, Which in a worthy mind sleepe neuer takes: Nor sole his natiue pitie vsde tofore, Willeth that her of helpefull grace he deygne, But profit moues him eke for profit store, T'will bring that in Damascus such do reygne, As may on him depend, and ope the dore, And plaine the path to euery his deseigne: And men may minister, and armes, and gold Against th'Egyptians, and his party hold. Whilst doubtfull thus his looke on ground he bends, And in deepe thought reuolues, and tosseth carkes, The Dames fixt eye on his countnance depends, And all his acts obserues, and heedy markes, And for delay time past her deeming spends, With feares and sighes she for his answere harkes: At last the craued grace he her denies, But th'answere gaue in kind and gentle wise. If in Gods seruice, who vs thereto chose, Our swords were not employed here to be; On them you safely might your hope repose, And you not pittie sole, but aide would we: But till that these his flockes, and till that those Oppressed walles we turne to libertie, It is not iust that forces sent away, On course of victory we thwart a stay. I promise, yet do you my faith receiue As noble pawne, and safe thereon rely; If euer we may yoake vnworthy reaue From those walles sacred, and most deere to sky, As pitie bids vs we no care will leaue, To winne againe your forlorne soueraigntie: But pitie now my pietie would blot, If first his right to God I render not. At this speech downe the Lady cast, and stayd Her eyes on th'earth, and stood vnmou'd a space, Then them bedewed, vp she lifts, and sayd, Accompaning her plaint with ruefull grace, Ah wretch on whom hath sky els euer layd A life so grieuous, and vnchangde to trace? That others nature rather change, and mind, Then my hard fortune should a changing find. No farder hope is left, I wayle in vaine, In humaine brest prayers haue no longer force: How may I thinke the tyrant fell my paine Will rew, which could in thee worke no remorse? Yet will I not of thy hard hart complaine, Which from my helpe doth this small aide diuorse: But plaint gainst heauen my harms cause addresse, Which makes in thee eu'n pitie pitilesse. Not you my Lord, not such is your bountie, But tis my dest'ny, which me aie denies; Dest'ny dismall, fell fatall destinie, Yeeld eke my hated life to death a prize: Was it (aye me) a slender iniurie, To close in youthes flowre my deere parents eyes? That thou must also see my kingdome rest? And thrald to th'axe as sacrifice me left? For since of vertues, law the dew respect Brookes not, that here I trifle longer stay, Where shall I fly the while? who shall protect? What ah yeeld refuge gainst the tyrant may? No place is vnder sky so closely deckt, Which gold not opes: then why do I delay? Death preast I see, which since to fly is vaine, This hand shall go, and fetch and entertaine. There silenc'd she, and seemed a disdaine Royall, and noble flamed in her face: Then turning steps, she showes to part againe, With port all framde to sad despiteous grace, Her ceaselesse mone in such a tune doth plaine, As is begot when wrath and woe embrace: And her new borne teares for they to see, Gainst sunny rayes, Christall and pearle bee. Her cheekes with those life humours sprinckelled, Which trickling dropt down on her vestures hemme, Seem'd entermingled roses white and red; If so a dewy cloud do water them, When to calme breath their closed lap they spred, What time first peered dawning takes his stemme, And morne which them beholds &amp; in them ioyes, Proud with their ornament her lockes accoyes. But that cleere humour which embellisheth Her bosome and faire cheekes with drops so thicke, Workes the effect of fire, and close creepeth Into a thousand breasts, and there doth sticke: O miracle of loue! which sparckes draweth From teares, and harts in water kindles quicke With flames, past nature still his powre extends, But in her vertue boue it selfe ascends. This fained sorrow drew from many a freake True teares, and harts vnstoand most hardened, Ech with her walles, and to himselfe doth speake, By Godfreys ruth if thy suit be not sped, His nurse some raging Tygre was, and eake On rugged Alpes some hideous cragge him bred; Or some sea waue which breakes, &amp; froth vpcastes, Fell man that broyles, and such a bewtie wastes. But Eustace gallant youth, whom fierie brand Of pitie and of loue, more feruent fride; Whiles ech else mutters, or doth silent stand, Steps foorth, and tongue to these bold words allide, My Lord and brother, with too straight a band Your stiffe minde is to your first purpose tide, If ioynt consent, which doth intreat and pray, To plyant bent, it somewhat cannot sway. I say not that the Princes, who their care Owe to these troopes, as they to them their awe, Should from this siedge with steps backe-turned fare, Or from their duetie their regard withdrawe: But mongst our selues, who Knights aduentrous are, Deuoyde of proper charge, nor bent to lawe, That others vnderly you safely might Cull out some ten to patronize her right. For from Gods seruice not bereft is hee, Who doth a Virgin innocent defende, And deere those spoyles vnto the heauens bee, Which of a slaughtred Tyrant any sende: If then to this attempt the profit mee Not swayd, which thence assured we attende: Yet duetie would me moue by dueties right, Our order doth our aide to Ladies plight. Ah be it farre (for-god) that any say, In Fraunce or where-so else raignes courtesie, That for a cause, which on a ground doth stay So iust, and good, perill or paine we fly, My selfe here downe my helme and curets lay; Here I my sword vngird, nor more will I My Courser manage, nor beare armes in fight, Nor eare henceforth vsurpe the name of Knight. So spake he, and with him his fellowes all, Concording iangle in a shrilly sound, And his aduice bootfull and good they call, And Captaine presse with prayers, and around I yeeld, then sayed he, me vanquish shall So manies concourse, so together bound: Graunt we her boon, if so your will encline, But be it your aduice, and none of mine. But if that Godfreys credit ought you prize, Some measure yet on your affections place: This sole he spake, and this can them suffize, For what he graunted, ech gan soone embrace: Now what worke not a faire Dames pewling eyes? And in tongue amarous words hony grace? From her sweet lips issues a golden chaine, Which soules doth captiue, and at pleasure raine. Eustace her calleth backe, and cease (he sayes) Lady of bewtie, this your drooping cheere, For we will yeeld such, and within few dayes, As for your feare shall more then iust appeare: Armida then vnshrowdes her cloudie rayes, And countnance doth with such a smile endeere, As her bewtie enamoureth the skyes, Whilst with her precious vayle she wipes her eyes. Her selfe then yeeldes she in notes deerely sweet, Gratefull for so large graces they bestow, Which printed in her hart thence neuer fleet; But them for euer shall the world know: And what the tongue t'expresse appeares vnmeet, Dumbe eloquence doth in her gestures show, And close she hideth vnder borow'd looke, That thought whereof no one suspition tooke. Then seeing fortune fauour with a smile The great beginning of her fraudfull parts, Ere her conceipt be forst to vary stile, This wicked worke she'll end, and more then th'arts Of Circe or Medea could beguile: Her sweet showes and faire lookes shall beizle harts, And with well tuned voyce of Syrens kind, A slumber cast on the most wakefull mind. The wench ech art employes so to infold Some new-come louer with out-spreaded net, Nor alwayes, nor withall selfe looke doth hold, But changde on face, and grace in season set, Sometimes her basht eye seemes by shame controld, Sometimes with wishfull roules abroad to iet, With these the rod, with those she plyes the bit, As for their swift or slow loue seemeth fit. When any soule she from her loue espies Retire, and thoughts to bridle by despeires, To him kinde smile she opes, to him her eyes Sweet blinck, loues message cleare and cheery beares, The dastard sluggardly desires thus wyse She spurres, and doubtfull hope t'affiance reares, And kindling flames in wils enamored, Thaweth the yce by frozen feare ybred. Againe to some who hardly ouergo Dew bounds, led by their Chieftaine rash and blind, Sweet lookes and louely words more sparely flow, Whilst feare to reu'rence doth them prentise bind, Yet when disdaine her countnance changed so, Glimpsing therethrough some ray of pitie shind, That feare they may, but not dispaire they need, And she more longing doth more stately breed. Somewhile she gets her selfe elsewhere a part, And fashions frames, and doth a visage faine, As woe begunne, and from her eyes out-start Forst teares full oft, which in she drawes againe, The whiles to weepe in deede by such her art, A thousand simple soules she does constraine, And shafts of loue seasons in pities fire, That armes so strong may hart giue death to hire. Then as she would stealing away beguile Those thoughts, and new hope did awake her mind, Towards her louers bent she steps and stile, And in ioyes seemely weede her face she shrinde, And her bright hew and faire celestiall smile, Seem'd as a double Sunne, that gleaming shinde, On thicke and mystie clowds of sorrow sad, Which bout their breasts tofore it gathred had. But whiles she sweetly speakes, and laughes sweetly, And with this two-fold sweetnes luls the sense, Well neere she makes the soule from bodie fly, As gainst so rare delites voyde of defence, Ah cruell loue that slayth vs equally, Where wormewood thou or hony do dispence, And equall deadly at all seasons bee Mischiefes and medcines, which proceede of thee. Twixt tempers crossing thus in frost and flame, In plaint and laughter, and midst hope and feare, The wylie wench them makes her gleefull game, And more her state doth to assurance reare, And if some one dare tongue all trembling frame, With hoarse voyce witnesse of his paynes to beare, She faines as one vnskild in louers trade, Not see the mind whose words it ouert made. Or she her shamefast, and downe clyned eyes With tire and taint of honesty embowres, So as her gayest verdure vayled lyes Vnder the Rose, which her faire face beflowres, As at first birth we see the morning ryse, In his fresh blooming, and betimely howres, And blush of scorne fellowd with that of shame, Forth both at once, mixt and confused came. But if she any by his fashions spy, Bent to reueile his harts in burning paine, Now steale and fly him fro, now meanes supply Of speech she doth, and straight them reaues againe, So tyrde and skornd all day he treads awry, And at the last his hope she chops a twayne, Like hunter that at eu'ning leeseth vew Of Deere, whom long in chace he did pursew. These were the arts, with which she could surprize A thousand thousand soules by theeuish trade, Rather the armes with which in robbing wise, To force of loue them humble slaues she made; What maruaile then if fierce Achilles lyes, Or Hercules or Theseus to blade, Of loue a pray, if who for Christ it draw; The naughtie-packe sometimes do catch in paw. The end of the fourth Song. THE FIFTH SONG. While as Armida treacherous, thus-wise The Knight entyceth her loues maze to tread, Nor on the promisde ten alone relyes, But trusts her stealth should more a gadding lead: On whom to charge this daung'rous enterprize, Which she must guide, Godfrey wist not a read: For ventrers store, and worth in generall Breedes doubt, nor lesse their bent in speciall. At last he orders with well-ware foresight, That choyce of one from out themselues they take, Who should succeede to noble Dudons right, And this election at his pleasure make, That so no one with iust exception might Complaine, or he their causefull wrath awake: And show with all, how this most worthy band With him, in price doth of high valew stand. Then he them to him cals, and gan to say, You haue already vnderstood my minde, Which for the Damsels aide gaue not a nay, But to a riper season it assignde, This I propound a new, and well it may A dew assent of your opinions finde: For in the world light and chaungeable, T'is constance oft t'ensew thoughts variable. But if yet still you deeme it foully staine This your degree, such perils to refuse, And if your noble courage seeme disdaine, What so a counsell ouersafe ensewes, I will you not against your wils retaine, Nor calling backe my graunt, my faith abuse: But with you be it, as to be is right, The bridle of our rule gentle and light. To go then or to stay, content I rest, That on your pleasure freely it depend, Yet will, that first you make to Duke decest New successour, who may your charge attend, And mongst you ten out-cull, as likes him best, But take of ten expirde the choice shall end: For herein I reserue my sou'raignty, In all els, franke be his authority. So Godfrey spake, and th'answere to impart, Ech ones consent vpon his brother threw: Like as (O Captaine) this farre seeing art Of lingring vertue best beseemeth you, So vigour of the hand and of the hart Of vs is lookt, as debet by vs dew: And that ripe firmenesse, which in others case Is prouidence, in vs were vilety base. And since light harmes, which from this perill grow, Weyd with the profit, make the ballance rise: Your liking had, the chosen ten shall go With this Damsell to that braue enterprise: Thus he concludes, and with guile tyred so, Seekes close to vayle the minde, which inly fries With colour'd zeale; honours desire did moue The rest (as seem'd) but t'was desire of loue. But youngest Bulleyn with repining eye Vpon the Sonne, who of Sophia leeres, Whose vertue he admires enuiously, Which in fine feature more it selfe endeeres, His mateship nould, and suttle iealously, Wary conceipts vp in his fancie steeres, Whence he his counterstriuer drawne apart Arraisons him with this besmoothing art. O of great Sire, thou greater Sonne that art! Who young in price of armes bearst highest fame Of this braue band, whereof we make a part, Who shall be graced with commanders name? I that to famous Dudon, scarce my hart Sole for the honour of his age could frame T'obey, I Godfreys brother cannot see, Whom I should yeeld to saue alone to thee. Thee whose high lynage egals all the rest, Whose glory me, and merit hath out-gon, Nor lesse himselfe, in price of martiall quest To hold, disdaynes the greater Boglion: Thee I for Captaine craue, if in thee nest No will to be this Squadrons Champion, Ne thinke I thou wilt for that honour carke, Which may proceed from deeds obscure &amp; darke. Nor here wants place where you may bewtify Your haughtie valour with fames brighter ray, Now I'le procure (if you it not deny) This chiefe honour, the rest on you shall lay, But for I wot not well, what way to ply My hart, which plants in doubts his fickle stay: Let me obtaine that Armide at my will I follow may, or with thee tarry still. Here Eustace held his peace, nor vttered These later accents without blushing face, And his hot burning thoughts ill couered T'other well spide, and smiled at the case: But for loues slower stroakes, scarcely perced The vtter rinde, which did his brest embrace, Nor at a countermate he takes offence, Nor to pursew the wench he makes pretence. But deepely grau'd in holdfast thought abides Dudons sharpe death, whom long to ouer-liue, That it audacious Argant so betides, He counts will blemish of dishonour giue, And part into his eares with pleasing slides This speech, which him doth to dew honour driue: And his young courage ioyes and well appayes, In the sweet sound of his true tuned prayse. Whence thus he answerd, I hold more desire, Chiefe places to deserue then to obtaine, And if I may to vertues height aspire, Enuy I neede not others haughty raigne, Yet to this honour, as my fitting hire, If you me call, I will not curchy straine, But deere repute, that you so plaine a signe Expresse, how your good wils to me encline. Thus I it not desire, nor yet refuse, And I made Duke, you shall be of th'elect, So Eustace leaues him, and gins trauaile vse, This with his mates good liking to effect: But for selfe roome Prince Gernand hotly sewes, Whom though Armidas poisned shafts enfect, Yet in proud hart, lesse Ladies loue preuailes, Then thirst of honour, which more sharpe assailes. From Norway great Kings Gernand came of yore, Who many Realmes swayd with Emperiall blade; Which store of Crownes, and royall Scepters store Of Sire and Graundsires, him much haughtie made: Th'other on his owne worth him haughtie bore, More then on acts of elders noble trade, Albe of hundred yeares many a leace, They were renownd in warre, &amp; knowne in peace. But the Barbarian Lord, who measur'de sole, So farre as gold and rule can stretch the line, And deem'd ech vertue darke as quenched cole, Wherein some royall title did not shine, In no wise brookes that to the craued gole, The Knights like merit should their course combine: And growes so teasty, that by teeny spite, Past reasons bounds he is transported quite. So as the sprite malignant of the deepe, Who open in him saw this largy gate, Into him gan with couert silent creepe, And at the helme of his thoughts fleeing sate, And there his wrath ginnes more in hate to steepe, And more his hart to pricke, and more to grate, And worketh so that in his soule still sounds A voice, which reasons such to him propounds. Doth Reynold iust with thee? beares his vaine ranke Of elder worthies such Nobilitie? Then let him show (since thee he mates so cranke) The Nations thralled to his soueraigntie, Shew he his Realmes, his dead ones let him flanke, With thine that liue in royall dignitie, Ah how this Lord presumes of worthlesse rate Lord borne in Italy of thrald estate! Winne he or leese he, he is victor yet, Eu'n since he was thy countermate at first, What will the world say (and saying set His prayse a flaunt) with Gernand match he durst, That roome to thee some fame and credit get Well might, which noble Dudons glory nurst: But yet thy selfe wouldst it no lesse a grace, Where he by crauing it, doth it abase. And if they, who no longer breath or speake, To our affaires their knowing thoughts apply, Into what noble flame of wrath out breake Doth good old Dudon (thinke you) boue in sky? Whiles he aduiseth this, our copy freake, And on his sawcy boldnesse bends his eye, Who eu'n with him (scorning his worth and age) Dares to compare fond ouer-weening Page. Yea dares, and it attempts, and beares away In liew of chasticement, honour and laud, And some there are, who for him do and say, (O common shame) and vnto him applaud: But if Godfrey it see, and pleasde appay, That of what is thy dew he thee defraud, Bear't not, nor it to beare it is thy part, But shew him what thou canst, and who thou art. At such a speeches sound vpflames disdaine, And as a tossed brand in him it growes, Nor stuft and swollen heart it can containe, But out through eyes, and at the tongue it goes, What so blamefull, vndew, he deemes may staine Rinaldos honour, he doth all disclose: Him proud and vaine he faines, and his manhood He termes by name of rashnes, fond and wood. And what so of a great and haughty hart, Of loftie, and of noble, in him shinde, All this (shading the truth with euill art) He blames, as it were vice, and fault doth finde: And prateth so, as fame it gan impart To counter-knight by vulgars blabbing winde: Nor yet his wrath he slakte, or bridelled The blindfold bent, which should to death him wed. For that lewd feend, who mouing rulde his tong, In steede of breath and all his words did frame, Him made renew ech his outragious wrong, Still beeting fewell to his bosomd flame, Wide place there was in Camp, where seemly throng Of choicest persons euer flocking came: Where ioynd in wrastling and in turneyment, More vigour, and more skill, their lims they bent. Now there what time thickest encreast the preace, He (as his dest'ny gaue) Reynold accusde, And like keene shaft, against him gan addresse His tongue, in venom of Auerne infusde, And of his speech Reynold was my witnesse, Nor longer could restraine his wrath vnusde, But cryes thou lyest, and on him sets amaine, And in right hand doth naked weapon straine. His voice a thunder seemd, lightning his blade, Which tidings bringeth of the falling flash, He quakes, nor sees how fly, or how euade He may deathes present vneschewed lash, Yet since the whole Campe witnesse stood, he made Semblant, as nought him could dismay or bash: And his great foe attends, and weapon barde (Close setled for defence) he lyes at warde. Seene fiery swords wel-neere a thousand are That time at once to flame, for there around In flockt, and shoou'd, and prest of folke vnware A diuers troope, and through the aire rebound And whirle of voices that vncertaine fare, And of confused accents doth the sound: As at sea shore is heard when wind and waue, Murmures diuers in one confounded haue. But not a whit for others voices slakes, Th'offended warriour eyther brunt or ire, Fences and cryes he scornes, or what so brakes A stop, and to reuenge doth whole aspire: And through the men, &amp; through their armes he rakes, And whirles about his sword of flashy fire: So as to thousand guarders shame all lets Away he thrusts, and on Gernando sets. And with a hand, eu'n angry skild in fight, A thousand blowes quartring on him he layes, Now in the brest, now in the head, now right, Now left side, busie he to wound assayes: And his right hand so wimble was and wight, That eyes and art came short of his sly wayes: So as vnseene, and vnaduisde it lights, And strikes, &amp; foines, where least his feare affrights. Nor euer ceast, till in his brest plunged, Once and againe he had his fierce Morglay, The wretch fals groueling on his wound, and shed Foorth soule and spirits, by that dubble way: The vanquisher his sword yet sprinckelled With bloud, vpsheathes, nor there brooks longer stay: But turnes elsewhere, and casteth off withall His cruell mood, and his incensed gall. Good Godfrey to this tumult drawne the while, Findes dismall sight of vnexpected case, Gernand out stretcht his haire, and mantle vile, And moyst with bloud, and full of death his face: He heares the sighes and plaints, and diuers stile Of moanes, for warriour slaughtred in the place: Stonisht he queres, here where tis most forbid, Who ist that so much durst, and so much did? Arnalt one deerest to the Prince deceast, The case tels, and it telling gan augment, How Reynold slew him, and how thereto prest He was, by slight cause of a braine-sicke bent: And how the sword which guirded was to quest Of Christi gainst Christen Champions now he hent, And how he scornde his rule, and fore-restraint, And how herewith all did themselues acquaint. And that death to his guilt by law is dew, And ought (as was proclaimde) be punished, Both for the fault selfe beares a heynous hew, As for in such a place it happened, For if his errour such pardon accrew, More by his sample will be couraged, And that the wronged will to vengeance band Themselues, which now th'attend at Iudges hand, Which discord will beget, and bring forth blowes, Twixt such as part with tone and tother take, The dead mans merits vp he rips and showes, What so may pitie or disdaine awake, But Tancred it denies, and doth oppose Himselfe, and skusing forth accused spake: Godfrey listneth, and with a face seueare, Small cause affords of hope, but more of feare. Tancred then addes, my wise Lord, please it you, What and who Reynold is, in mind to call, What honour in his owne regard is dew, Both for his stocke renowmed, and royall, And for his Vnckle Guelfe, nor ought ensew, From rulers doome, on ech a paine equall: In diuers callings, one offence appeeres Diuers, and eu'nesse sole is iust with pheeres. The lower shall (answerd the Captaine) learne, By sample of the higher to obay, Tancred, you counsell ill, and ill discerne To thinke, Ile beare with greats vnruly sway, What were my rule, if sole with vulgar sterne, On none but base, and vile commaund I may? A powrelesse Scepter, a charge full of shame, If such law gaue it, I renounce the same. But franke and awfull it was giuen mee, Nor this authoritie shall any bate, And well I know, where, and when ought to bee Now price and paines, imposde of diuers rate, Now keeping tenour of equalitee, Not lowest seuer'd from the highest state: So spake he, t'other answere none affords, As vanquisht by the reu'rence of his words. Raymond a follower of the seuere, And sterne antiquitie, his speech commends, With these arts (sayes he) who so well doth beare His rule, the subiects to his reu'rence bends: For discipline is neuer soundest, where The guilty pardon more then paine attends: Downe fals ech Realme, ech mercy ruineth, Which on the base of feare not fasteneth. So spake he, and Tancred did well aduise These words, nor there time longer spent, But to Rinaldo-ward foorthwith him hies On steed, who seemed winged as he went: Reynold, when from fierce foe he had thus wise Rest, pride and soule returned to his tent: There Tancred found him, and makes full report, What sayd and answerd was, in eu'ry sort. Then he adioynes, albe no outward show, As faithfull witnes of the hart I prize, For in too inward part, and too hollow The thought of mortall wights conceiled lies: Yet dare I vouch by that on sight I know, In the Chieftaine (nor it he whole denies) That to the common law for guilt ordaind, He'll haue you thrald, and in his power restrainde. Rinaldo somewhat smilde, and with a face, In which twixt laughter, flashed a disdaine, Let him (quoth he) in bonds goe plead his cace, Thats bond, and fit for bondage hath a graine, I free was borne, and liue, and free in place Will die, ere base cord hand or foot astraine: Vsde to my sword, and vsed Palmes to beare, Is this right hand, and scornes vile gyues to weare. But if for my deserts such recompence Godfrey will yeeld, and me in prison cast, As I of vulgar were, and beare pretence In common fetters to vptie me fast, Then let him come or send, I will not hence: Twixt vs shall chance, and armes be Iudges plast, Ile of a dismall Tragedy the shoe Present for pastime to our forraine foe. This said, he cals for armes, and head and brest, In steele of finest choice most seemely shrines, And with his waighty shield his arme he prest, And fatall blade vnto his side combines, And with a semblant braue and nobellest, (As lightning wonts) he in his armour shines, Mars he resembles thee, when from fift heau'n Thou comst down guirt with ire &amp; ghastly leau'n. Tancred this while his fierce sprites doth procure, And hart vpswolne with pride to mollifie: Inuict young man (he sayes) to your valure, I know, ech hard and tough attempt will plie With ease, I know, that euer most secure Midst armes and terrour stands your vertue hie: But God forbid you make it such appeere, So cruelly to our annoyance heere. Tell me, what meane you do? will you go staine Your yet cleane hands in bloud of ciuill warre? And with Christens vnworthy wounds, againe Peirce Christ, of whom we part and members are? And shall respects of fading honour vaine? (Which like sea waues soone flow, and ebbe as farre) Worke more with you, then either faith or zeale? Which glory bring of heauens endlesse weale? Ahno (for God) conquer your selfe, and kill This fiercenesse of your ouer haughty minde, Giue place, it is no feare but holy will: For Palme is to your giuing place assignde, And in my yeeres of young vnripened skill, If any may sutewoorth example finde, I also was prouokt, yet neuer grew Gainst faithfull fierce, but did my selfe subdew. For when Cilicia Realme, by mine effort I wanne, and Christen Ensignes there addrest, Baldwyn comes on, and in vnworthy sort It straightwayes seizd, and made a base conquest: Whilst bearing of a friend ech way the port, At his so greedy bent I neuer ghest, Yet seeke thereof recouery by fight I nould, though it perhaps performe I might. And if you also prisonment refuse, And fetters fly, as waight vnmoble fro, And th'uses rather and th'opinions chuse, On which men name of honours lawes bestow, Let me alone, Ile you to Captaine skuse, Do you to Boemund at Antioch goe, That he you out in this first brunt may beare, So gainst his sentence safe bide shal you theare. Soone will it hap, if the Egyptian state, Or other Painim troope against vs warre, That clearer much your valour of high rate Will shine, while that from hence it bideth farre, And Campe will seeme (you wanting) out of date, As corps whose arme and hand off chopped are, Here Guelfe comes in, &amp; doth this speech approue, And wils that thence he speedily remoue. To their aduises the disdainefull hart, Of this audacious youth, beturning plies, So as foorthwith from thence aside to start, To such well-willers he no more denies, Friends store (the while) flocke in from euery part, And with him craue to goe in earnest wise, He thankes them all, and for attendants chose Two only Squires, and so to horse he goes. He parts, and of high glory a large bent Pertakes, the spurre and rod of noble sprite: His hart all vowd t'exploits magnificent, Doth none but workes of rarest price endite, Midst foes (as champion of the faith) he ment, That Palme or Cypresse should his paines acquite: He'll Egypt scoure, and pierce eu'n to the hole, Where from his vncouth spring Nile doth outrole. But Guelfe, when as the fierce young man thus wise, Prest to depart, had bid them all adew: There brookes no longer stay, but speedy hies, Where guesse might Godfrey soonest yeeld to vew, Who spying him, with voyce of higher size, Said (Guelfe) this very time I wisht for you, And sent but late to sundry wheres about, Some of our Herhaults to enquire you out. Then makes all els withdraw, and turning low, Begins with him a graue speech to contriue, Your Nephew verily (my friend Guelfo) To headlong runnes, where heats his courage driue, And of his deede (I deeme) can hardly show Some cause, that may to iust pretence arriue: Deere would I hold that so it might befall, But Godfrey stands an equall Duke withall. And will, of what so lawfull is and right, In ech case guardeine and defender bee, Preseruing still from tyrant passions might, His vnsubdewed hart in iudging free, Now if that Reynold by constraint him dight, To wrong th'edict, and sacred maiestee Of discipline, as some alleage, behooues He can, and take our doome, &amp; make his prooues. Come he to his restraint in liberty, What may be to his merits I consent, But if he this disdaine, and stand stiffely, (Well wot I his vntamed hardiment) Do you to bring him your best care apply, Least he force one of slow and gentle bent, Seuere auenger be of his Empire, And of the lawes, as reason doth require. So did he speake, and Guelfe replyed thus, No minde that shames what iustly may defame, Can speeches heare of scorne iniurious, And not repulse them backe from whence they came, If wrongers slaughter then the wrong discusse, Who ist that bounds can to iust furie frame? Who can his blowes, and what to fault is dew, In heat of bickring wey, and measure trew? But that the youth should come in, and obay Your sou'raigne iudgement, as you now require, Me greeues, it cannot be, for farre away He straight his steps did from the hoast retire, Yet this right hand a gage of proofe I lay, Gainst him that blew this false accusals fire, Or who so els beares like malicious hed, That shame vniust, he iustly punished. I say, with reason he Gernando hault, Downe forst the hornes of his stout pride to bend, Your broken charge (if any) was his fault, This sole I sorrow, nor will it commend: He peac'd, let him (quoth Godfrey) fetch his sault, And brawles beare other where, nor I intend, That you more seede here of new quarrels sow, Ah no (for-God) let old strifes also go. This while her proffred succour to procure, The lewd deceitfull wench no time forslowes, All day she spends in prayres, and puts in vre, What helpe from art, or wit, or bewtie growes, But when the night spreading her robe obscure, The day light in the West gan vp to close, Twixt her two Knights, and matrons twaine aside, Where her pauilion pitched was, she hide. But though for art of wiles the price she bare, And kind her port were, and her manners quent, And she so faire as neuer greater share The heau'ns tofore on any woman spent, So as in Campe most of the Champions rare, She with a strong and holdfast pleasure hent, Yet on the bayt of any her delite, No tycing could good Godfrey winne to bite. In vaine she sought to slocke, or with mortall Sweetnings t'enroll him in Cupidos pay: For as a gorged Hawke stoupes not at call Of Faulkners lure, vpon his traine to pray; So he full of the world, frayle pleasures all Scornes, and mounts to the sky by vncouth way: And what so snares, vnfaithfull loue contriues, Gainst his faire flight he of effect depriues. Nor any let could make his steps retrace From path, which God points holy thoughts t'ensew, With him a thousand arts she tryes, and face Of thousand formes him showes (as Prote new) Well might her gestures sweet, and seemely grace Wake loue, where cold sleepe did it most imbew: But here (mercy the Lord) ech proffer vaine Proued, ne bootes it to beginne againe. The faire Dame who to kindle did suppose Ech chasest hart with onely blincke of eye: O how she haultnes (now) and pride forgoes! How this her spite with meruaile gan ally, At last, where lesse doubt of gainestriuing shoes, She new resolues her forces to apply, Like tyred Captaine, who leaues siedge of fort Impregnable, and makes elsewhere resort. But gainst this wenches armes his hart no lesse Inuict to be, Tancredi will approue, For other longings his whole brest possesse, Nor any new heat may the old remoue, For as one venom vseth to represse The tothers force, so tone doth tother loue, These sole, not much or little could she gaine, Ech els, her fairest fire enflamde amaine. She though it greeu'd, that not a thorow sway, Fortune allowd her purpose and her art, Yet of so many Champions a pray So noble, somedeale comforteth her hart: And ere some one her fraudes discouer may, Thinkes to conduct them to a safer part: Where them she will in other chaines enfold Then those, wher with th? thral she now doth hold So when the tearme was present come, that dayd The Captaine had, some succour her to yeeld, Before him reu'rent she appeares, and sayd, Time out doth date (Sir) of your promise weeld, And if sell Tirant learne, that vnder ayd Of these your armes, I seeke my selfe to sheeld, He will prepare his forces for defence, Nor we shall easly compasse our pretence. Then ere the newes hereof, some certaine spy Him beare, or flying flames vncertaine winde: Let of your valiantst men by your pitty, Some few with me to march be straight assignde: For if the heau'ns view not with froward eye Mens workes, nor innocence cast out of minde, I shall my Realme regaine, and Towne and field, In peace and warre shall you still tribute yeeld. So said she, and the Captaine to her woordes Graunteth what could not be denyde, Though whiles to parture she no stay affoordes, He sees himselfe to this election tyde, But of the ten, ech one the number boordes, And with strange instance to be chosen plyde: And emulation, which in them awakes, More in the suit importunate them makes, She, that in them wide open sees the hart, It hauing seene, takes a new argument, And iealousies grim feare lasheth a part On their haunches, as scourge of dire torment: Well weeting that at last without such art, Loue waxeth old and slow, and slaketh bent, Much like a Steede who neuer gallops swift, Vnlesse some after, some tofore him shift. And in such wise she can her words allot, And her entycing looke and louely smile, That none there is, who t'other enuies not, Nor so they feare, but that they hope the while, Thus the fond rout of ech inamourd sot, Spurd on by show of hew all shapte to guile, Vnbridled runs, nor shame restraines them ought, And Captaine backe to rayne them vainly sought. He that to please ech partie doth aspire, With equall bent, and leanes to neither side, Though somewhat now with shame, &amp; now with ire, At these his Knights such peeuishnes he fride: Yet since so obstinate grew their desire, On a new fetch (t'accord them) he relide, Write you your names, and in a vessell place Me them, (quoth he) and lots shall try the cace. Foorthwith then ech ones name is papered, And in small pitcher cast, and all too shooke, And drawne by hap, and first that issued, Artemedoro was, Earle of Pembrooke, Next Gherards name fild eares that listened, And passage after these Wincelay tooke, Wincelay who so graue and sage tofore, Now old is louer, and a princox hore. O how these three that first were chosen, haue Their countnance mery, and their eyes with child Of ioy, which doth from brinefull hart out-waue, Fortune (loues friend) speede eu'ry plot they build, The rest whose names the pitcher held in graue, Showd doubt, and iealousie were not exilde, And at his mouth they hang, whose h?d forth drew The opned briefes, and red the residew. Guasco the fourth came forth, to whom succeedes Ridolfo, and to Ridolfe, Olderick, Then of Ronciglio he Gulielmo reedes, And Eurard the Bauier, and Francke Henrick, Rambaldo was the last, who changing creedes, Made choice gainst Iesus damned foe to kick, Eu'n so much loue could do, tennes number he There closed vp, the rest excluded be. Which rest with wrath, enuie and iealousy Enflamde, fortune vniust, and brothell call, And blame thee loue that didst her not deny, Within thy Realme her iudgement throne to stall: But for engraffed in mankind we try, That most forbidden, most we couet all: In spite of fortune many them dispose, To follow her when darke the welkin growes. They will her follow still, in Sunne and shade, And for her (fighting) hazard life and soule, She spares some becks, &amp; with chopt words that wade Halfe-way, and with sweet sighes them on doth toule: And that them left, her parture must be made, With tone and tother eft she gan condoule: Buskled in armes this while, them readie make The ten Knights, and of Godfrey congey take. This wise man ech one monisheth a part, How Painims faith vncertaine is and light, And ill assured pledge, and by what art Men snares may shunne, and haps of heauy plight: But with the wind his words away do start, Nor loue brookes counsell of aduised wight, At last he giues them licence, and the Dame Stayes not her parting till the morrow came. The conqueresse departs, and her before, Those riuals she in Triumph marshalled, As prisoners, and to harmes hugy store, The rest of all her loues abandoned, But vnder wings, when night out issew'd, bore Silence, and sweums roaming idlehed, Then secretly (as loue them counsell lent) Tracing Armidas steps, full many went. Eustace her followes first, who scarce abide Could, till nights shadow day-light had yshrinde, But hasty hyes where him best pleasd to guide, Through blind darkenes, a Chieftaine all as blind: That faire coole night his wandring way he plide, But when the ioyous light appearing shinde, Armide appeared likewise with her troope, Where a burgage had beene their lodging coope. To her-ward fast he fares, and by his crest Rambaldo soone him knowes, and asking cryde, Why there he came, and what he had in quest: I come to follow (answerd he) Armide, Nor (if vnscornd) lesse shall mine aide be prest, Nor lesse my faith be in her seruice tryde: T'other replies, so great honour to proue, Who hath thee chosne? and he reioyned, loue. Loue chused me, thee Fortune, now decree Who choicest right, from iustest chuser hath Quoth Rambalt then, nothing auayleth thee, This title false, these arts are way to skath, Nor mongst her lawfull Champions, mayst thou bee Allow'd to trace this royall Virgins path, Seruant of lawlesse rate, and who (replies The youth now waxeth hoat) it me denies? I it forfend, then answer'd he againe, And with that word against him marching went, And holding will of equalling disdaine, T'other him moues with equall hardiment, But here her hand out stretcht a twixt them twaine, Steps their soules Tyrant midst their furious bent, And sayes to th'one, ah this your grudging cease, That you compagnion I a champion crease. If you my safety loue, why me depriue, In such neede, do you, of this new supply? Then sayes to him, you fit and thankt arriue, On whose defence my fame, my life, rely, No reason would that I should packing driue So welcome and so noble company, Thus talking, whiles on way they vantage win, Some new come Champion hourely droppeth in. Some come from th?ce, &amp; some fr? hence, ne knowes Tone of the tother, but ech lookes a skance, She glad them entertaines, and all she showes, For such their comming, mirth and iouyssance, But when the dimmy ayre now cleerer growes, Godfrey gate of their parture cognisance, And his mind (which their damage did foregeeue) At some their future ill, seem'd to aggreeue. Whilst more hereon he casts, there doth appeere A messenger, dusty, panting, with grace All sad, and port, which newes of heauy cheere Brings, and beares sorrow written in his face, My Lord (quoth he) there will at sea appeere Th'Egyptian great fleete within little space: William (to whom the Gene ships subiect bee) This fresh aduiso sendeth you by mee. He addes, whiles a conuoy was conducted Of vittailes to the Campe-ward from the fleet: Their horse and Camels heauy burdened, Amids the way a grieuous cumber meet: So as guarders all slau'd, or slaughtered In fight, none could his fellowes safety greet, And that th'Arabian theeues, at front and backe, Them in a vale assayling, wrought this wracke. And how the mad rage and licentiousnesse Of those Barbarian rogues, so greatly grow, That like a hugy floud past all redresse, Around they spred, and ech place ouer-flow: Whence needs (to th'end some awe may th? represse) A band of men gainst them be sent to go: Who from the sands of Palestina sea, Scowring, may to the Campe assure the way. From one to th'other language straight the fame Hereof passeth, and soone extendeth wide, And common Souldier to himselfe doth frame Great feare of famine, which will soone betide, The Generall discreete, who findes now lame The haughtie courage wont in them to bide, Doth by this cheerefull looke and words, procure Their drooping to reuiue and reassure. Oh you that with me past haue here and there A thousand perils, and a thousand woes, Champions of God, whom his faith to repaire Euen from your birth, deere Christians he chose, You that Greeke guiles, and Persian armes ech where Vanquisht, and hils, and seas, and winter throwes, And thirst, and pinching famines hard distresse, Shall daunting feare your spirits now possesse? Can then the Lord, who you doth stirre and guide, Well knowen earst in oft more grieuous case, Not now assure you? as if turn'd aside His hand of mercy were, or holy face? One day t'will ioy to thinke what harmes betide Vs did, and vowes to pay to th'eauenly grace, Now hold couragious on, and keepe I pray, Your selues to fortune of a better day. With these words he their minds, tofore dismaide Comforts, and with a cleere and cheerefull looke, But yet amid his brest, in heapes vplaide A thousand sad sharpe cares their lodging tooke, How he so many men may feed and aide, Twixt want &amp; dearth his thoughtfull mind it shooke. How he may fleete at Sea withstand, and how Th'Arabian robbers he may breake or bow. FINIS.</field>
