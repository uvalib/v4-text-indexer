      <field name="fulltext">LANDSCAPES IN VERSE. ARGUMENT. Absence of Cleone:âIts Effects on Theodorus, an Enthusiast.âThe Imagery chiefly sought by, and most desirable to, separated Lovers.âAddress to the Muses.âInvocation to Fancy:âHer Power variously illustrated;âFavours Theodorus by painting Cleone as present.âLandscapes:âMorning; âthe Cliffâthe Mountainâthe Meadâthe Styleâthe Riverâthe Orchardâthe Cottage and Cottagersâthe Fir-Groveâthe different Objects and Scenery descriptive of and belonging to each.âAgenor and Fanny, an Episode.âSunshine and Cloud:âHappiness and Misery.âTheodorus continues his LandscapesâThe Lake, &amp;c. &amp;c.âThe Power and Influence of the Lyre upon the Imagination and the Passions:âAmbitionâRevenge âJealousyâGeniusâFriendship and LoveâConsolatory Ode; &amp;c. &amp;c. Cleone lost!âthough lost but till the moon, On her blue throne with crescent ray shall shine, (O space eternal to th'enamour'd heart!) Young Theodorus,âof his passion proud, And fondly nursing ev'ry woe it brings, Proud of the sacred lyre,âAffection's friendâ Sorrow and Love's associateâfrom the world Withdrawnâthus tun'd th'enthusiast lay,â Sun, veil thy beams! nor with unwelcome light Pierce the deep solitude my soul has found Sacred to Love, to Silence, to Cleone. Arch over arch let woven verdure spread: Thicken thy darkest foliage round my bower, O Nature, Goddess of this green recess! Folly, obtrude not on my virtuous sighs, Sighs, from which Folly ever must be free, For when did Folly love? or when shall know The cherish'd Grief that shuns society, Feeds on her faithful tears, and finds a charm, Where Folly fears to tread, but Love delights (In absence of the nymph ador'd) to dwell. Passion's pale haunts, all hail!âThe forest glooms, Whose tenfold umbrage midst the blaze of noon Sheds utter darkness:âThe chill cell of Him, Who holds no farther converse with the world:â The cavern'd rock, which opes its shaggy jaws Beside the main, to drink the foaming wave:â The hut of shepherd on the blasted heath, Where Pleasure's eye turns frighted from the waste, And the keen winds, which here find no controul, Tear up the hardy Thistle by its root, Tho' native of the desert:âThe scath'd tree, Black with the passing lightnings:âThe deep dell Bushy and unfrequented, where the streams Work their slow passage thro' the tangled grass:â The cypress grove:âThe church-yard guarding yews Waving o'er recent graves, ev'n while the moon Shines on the grassy bed of mouldering friend, Where oft we chill our bosoms with the dews That bathe his turf:âThe sudden-opening tomb That shews to Fancy's eye the shivering form, Dead and alive at once, of her who late Fill'd our bereaved arms:âPassion's pale haunts, Again, all hail!â Here Theodorus paus'd, But soon to Melancholy's softer note, Suiting his lyre, th'attemper'd strain began. Ah me! with what a leaden pace the hours Lag on, retarding with their cumbrous wings, When first divided from the nymph we love! Yet fleeter than the trackless lightning's flame, Speed the quick minutes when we court their stay; And ere th'impassion'd vow, at morning seal'd On fair Cleone's lip, can be enshrin'd Upon my heart, Love's faithful register, The warning watch-bell from yon jealous tower, Tolls out the parting knell. But now, alas! Ah! that his pinion faster than the light Could post to our next meeting!âSurly Time Across his shoulder hangs the vacant scythe Upon his idle crutch suspended leans, And with the lingering step of stooping age Lengthens each flagging moment to a year! Come then, ye Muses, sorrow-soothing Maids, Ye who can pencil high the future joy! Come, with Imagination's pregnant store Of young ideas, tender-tinted flowers Of fragrance heavenly sweet, and hue divine, Come, with soft Consolation:âO, descend, And bring along, companion ever-lov'd Fancyâthe brightest of th'Ã¦therial host, She, who in visionary robes of light, Sky-woven, and of texture exquisite, Finer than threaded sun-beamsâknow'st to dress Anew, that parted bliss, which in the urn Of yesterday was clos'd; she who revives What Time has torn away; who can restore The dead,âthe buriedâsuch is transport lost:â Blessed enchantress! who by Mem'ry's aid Canst bid the raptures of the past arise, Unblemish'd from the tomb, in all their charms. Fancy, attend! for thou, magician fair, The angel form of her my soul adores, Canst place before my eyes. And soft: methinks, Led on by thee, I have her in my view; Lo! there her gracious image! we trace back, By thee assisted, O seraphic guide! Each hallow'd step to recollection dear: And tho' the space of many a gloomy league Cruel divides me from her gentle hand, Benignant Thou hast lock'd it fast in mine, And bids it give me back the thrilling touch That speaks a kind return; or lays it soft Upon the breast which scarcely holds the heart, That in sweet tumult trembles at the pressure. And now, again, by thy celestial power We taste together morning's balmy gale, And dash the early dew-drop from the thorn; We mark the maiden verdure of the spring Just bursting from the budsâher violets cull Where blue they bloom in fair humilityâ Emblems of virgin grace and modest worthâ The loveliest tenants of the lowliest hedge Yet sweeter than the proudest flower, that grows, Child of ambition, on the mountain's top. Now slow along the blossom'd dale we go Wooing sequester'd Silence, where she sits Embow'r'd with shrubs (impervious to the ken Of eyes which keep their worship for the world) Refuge of tender hearts, who still must fear (So delicately white th'unsullied gloss Of innocence in love and faith engag'd) To âspot its snowy mantle, Sterne.â should it mix With the mad multitude, where passions fell, And strangers to their bosom, enter wild, Like Sin and Death in Paradise, to jar On the soft music of according souls! Together now we climb th'aspiring brow Of yonder tow'ring cliff, where zephyrs bland Come fresh from heav'n to greet us:âthere arriv'd, Ev'n at the skyey summit, far from men And near the breath of Gods, we rest awhile;â Ah! pause to memory precious; grac'd, perchance, With ev'ry fond endearment honest Love Dare ask, or innocent Affection give:â The joy of admiration undisturb'd;â The ardent gaze of fondness o'er the face That blooms a thousand graces on the look, As deep attention draws the varying blush;â The thrilling glance, that in the trembling heart Stirs the deep sigh, and pierces ev'ry sense With aching rapture Love alone can feel;â The touch which holiest Innocence allows, A touch, tho' lighter than the gossamer, Or the thin down that from the thistle flies When summer zephyrs sport, can shake the frame More than the hurricane the bending reed;â The faultering accent;âPassion's lavish praise, Ah! gracious Flattery!âSilence too, that pleads Beyond what Tully spokeâan eloquence Unborrow'd of the tongue, which every heart In love interprets, feels conviction strong, That language never yet (tho' breath'd from lips Where Science dwelt, and Harmony her seat Had fix'd, to win and to inform the ear) Could boastâthe silent Eloquence of Love. Again he paus'd: again renew'd the song. But soft! methinks we now delighted trace The varied beauties of the vale below, Where art and nature rival wonders give, Each prodigal of objects meet to lure The roving eye, which travels o'er the whole. Lo! Fancy now is seated on the hill, To etch the vernal landscape, as it spreads In one unbounded prospect from the bower And neighb'ring fount, sacred to Love sincere: Ev'n there, methinks, we now together stand At radiant morn, charm'd with these varied views: The dwindled city half conceal'd in smoke:â Mortals diminish'd,âto the blush of prideâ Hurrying like busy emmets thro' the street:â The cultur'd gardens glittering in the dew:â The scarce-distinguish'd husbandman, who bends To dress the grateful soil:âThe quiet sheep Which on th'adjacent mountain seem to hang Their fleeces on its sides:âThe dusky car, The intersecting roads, whose whit'ning gleam Contrast the verdure of the smiling meads:â The river, like a serpent, twining fair In many a lucid labyrinth, glowing now With Morn's reflected beam, now sombrous made By darkling shadows as they flit along Swifter than gliding spectres:âThe small cots, Abodes of wholesome labourâwhere we see How few, how cheap, and easily supply'd The real wants of man:âThe pillar'd domes, Abodes of wealth and grandeurâwhich display Necessities that nature never form'd:â A gorgeous waste of proud magnificence!â And last we note the intermixing fanes, Abodes of rapt devotionâwhich the sun, As conscious of their sanctity, invests With orient light, that like a glory plays Upon the holy spire, and sainted tower! Next, Fancy wanders with us down the slope, In variegated blooms and verdure rich, To yonder path, that in the bottom lies, Which clad in tenderest green, scarce shews the print Of Love's light step, beneath whose pressure smooth Springs many a flower, which in life's beaten road Refuse to grow, or shed their modest sweets Too fragrant for the world.âNo sounds are here But low of heifer, bleat of lambkin mild, Matin of warbling bird, or lapse of rill, Whose scarce-heard murmur, like the tender plaint Of some fond youth just parted from his nymph, Wailing a moment's absence, sighs so soft 'Tis tearful pleasure. Now we view the stile, A simple branch of maple plac'd aslant, Rustic and unadorn'd; near which the May-bush waves Its virgin blossoms, while beneath its shade Wild flow'rs, in love with water, faintly lend Their scanty essence, bathed in the brook Which, by the foot-stone, trickles to the verge Of the fair river, who with easy flow Glides silent on, and oft, in passing, greets His aged willows, that in waiting seem To bow their bare and venerable heads Along his tufted banks. Ah! spot serene! Here by the various charm of nature bound, Each object stealing swift into the heart, By potent Truth impell'd, by Fancy fir'd, Soften'd by Love, by all in union met, That fills the eye with Passion's blissful tear, The breast with transport, and the soul with joys, Which few of this bad world, alas! shall feel, Cleone tries her pencil, sketching fair The Paradise she shares:âThe landscape lives Beneath her magic touch:âAnd lo! the glen Skirting the lucid stream, where flow'ring shrubs, The hawthorn hedge, and many an orchard tree, Whose antique trunks, with mossy coats are wrapt, While from their arms, irregular and old, Bursts the young blossom, like the ruddy bloom That temperance fixes in the wholesome cheek Of blameless age:âSoft peers, thro' foliage deep, The russet dwelling of an antient pair, Who thrice ten smiling years, beneath its roof, (Blush gay and great ones of a jarring world!) Have led a virtuous life of wedded Love! In days of nuptial dissonance and strife, This pattern, rare and high, Cleone views, And plucking soft the unadorned latch, Enters the cot, where love with nature reigns Far from the city artifice:âthe pair We find, with all their progeny around, In goodly rows assembled at the board Of buxom health, who spreads the light repast, Which hospitality, (such as of yore Our Antient Britons, lov'd, ere courtier pomp The once wide opening door insidious clos'd) With importunings sweet, invites to share. Their offer'd boon accepted, we survey Silvan Simplicity her graces lend To clear Content, who in the herdsman's hut (Which scorns the gilding of felicity) Resides with real Happiness a friend, Ev'n as an Houshold Goddess, ever near With gentle hand, to bless this couple blythe, To pour the spirit of the freshest gale Upon the modest rose that humbly blows Around their dwelling small:âfrom the clean spring That lends its little tide, the purest stream To draw, for use or pleasure:âo'er the couch To shed the sweetest sleep from night till morn, Light as the silent dews that fall in both. And now we listen to the honest tale Of cottage fondness, and of cottage faith Told by the matron, while the shepherd swain (Instructed well to read the secret heart) Traces with skill, even to its rosy source, The crimson flush that paints Cleone's cheek, As, by the scene subdued, I seem more close To fold her tender form:âThis counsel kind Distill'd at length like honey from his lip: âYes, youth and maiden, I can see your hearts âTwine round each other like your circling arms:â âBehold! in us, a pair grown old together, âOur morning tender, and our evening true; âThen live and love, as we have lov'd and liv'd;â âGo with our mutual blessing on your heads; âAnd when in richer domes, ye see pale Care âLift her proud crest to cheat the gaping croud âWith specious shews of rapture, seldom found âIn palace or in hutâthen softly say, âAs many a year remote when we are laid âBeneath the verdant turf, ye hither come, âHere dwelt the Couple of the Cot;âhere oft âWe sat us down in courtship's blooming hour, âAnd swore, if Hymen e'er should join our hands, âTo live as faithful, and to love as long.â All these, and yet a thousand more, of power To charm the fond enthusiast, Fancy lends:â And now again she bears us on her wings, Glossy with dyes, more vivid than the hues Which in the rainbow vary, to fresh scenes. Under her guidance, soon, secure we reach, Ah! sweet remembrance! yonder breezy down Stretch'd like a lawn, full many a verdant rood Of velvet sod compos'd;âhard by a grove Of all-enduring firs, their ample rows Extend in fair array;âthither we speed, There woo the umbrage, whose immortal leaves Outlive the wintry blast;âalong the grass Unsunn'd, of darkest green, and hung with dew That chills the length'ning glade, pensive we go, Pensive, yet pleas'd; for gentle Love attends Our pilgrim steps: and where Love deigns to lead, Smooth is the rock, and midnight darkness smiles. At length upon a seat of mossy stone Resting, we listen to the whisper'd gale That sighs amongst the trees;âlo! now it plays On my Cleone's cheek, or sportive hides In her luxuriant tresses, meriting Th'Ã¦therial visitant;âand hark! we hear Another guest assorted to the scene, The widow'd Turtle mourns amongst the boughs, That echo to her sobs; and from the vale The village bell with melancholy sound Rings out the knell of death:âat every pause The dismal tone admits, my throbbing heart Suggests to Fancy's startled ear, the hour, When she who is now seated by my side (On the due motion of whose wholesome pulse My being hangs) shall wake a note like this! O as I turn affrighted thought this way, Horror its icy tear upon my cheek Congeals; I draw the object of my griefs More near my breast, on which the last cold drop Of my Cleone's life appears to fall, And the soft orbs, which now their gentle beams Lambent with love, dart on my inmost soul The light of tenderness, shall shine no more. Alas! the blood that feeds my mourning heart Seems wrested from its course:âStrange shudders seize My lab'ring frame, and in her fate, my own Glooms in dark characters upon my brow: Cleone feels the change;âand in her eye, Of unaffected sympathy the shrine, Where nature's genuine incense sweetly flows In scorn of artâher imitation vileâ Springs the soft tear that hurries to her lip, On which it hangs like dew-drops on the rose. I'll kiss it off. âO frail mortality! âThy flowrets bloom about the human heart âLike slender blossoms on the slightest stem âWhich Flora's breath may wound! ev'n as the leaf âOf aspin young, that shivers in the gale âWith which Aurora plays, when first she sheds, âAt earliest tinge of aromatic dawn, âFresh gather'd fragrance over earth and heav'n! âOh! of what silken texture hast thou wove âMan's proudest hopes! to which, the waving film âWhose light web floats across the glowing mead, âThe radiant net-work of a summer day, âIs as a massive chain, compact and strong! âO frail! O weak! O poor Mortality!â Ev'n in this self-same spot, (by memory hung With deepest glooms)âthis melancholy spotâ Now many a variegated year elaps'd, On autumn's verge and at the evening hour, Such were the accents bursting on my ear, As from a voidâfor no apparent form Th'astonish'd eye that search'd the scene around Could traceââO frail mortality!â The breeze resum'd, in repetition strong, Distinct and awefulââFrail mortality!â Re-echo'd thro' the hollow of the grove, That grove, of late so redolent of bliss, Whisp'ring the voice of love.âAt length I saw, From the surrounding foliage rushing forth Into the darkest path, a sable form In mourning garmentsâhis disorder'd locks Half veil'd his visageâvehement and loud, Temperate and sad, by turns, he wept, or rav'd; Ev'n as some ghost had burst th'unquiet vault Haunting the murderer. Oft he quicker strode, Spurning the ground; and as he swept along Would rend th'opposing branchesâlash the air With the torn boughs, then throw them as in scorn Upon the sounding earthâthen raise his armsâ Then clench his hands in horror; till his grief, Like some vast bed of waters, fathomless, Flow'd silent, in the depths of agony For clamour too profound:â'Twas dumb despair. Anon the passing bell with sullen tone Knoll'd thro' the firs:âthe falling shades of night Began to thicken round:âthe swelling winds Bore the dead notes upon their viewless wings Piercing the man of sorrow, who aghast Broke short his step, and, as by light'ning smote, Stood fix'd, with palms uplifted:âwith soft voice I spakeâhe heard notâwith a gentle step I cross'd his pathâhis eyes were bent on heav'n:â He saw me notâhis vision was above!â And next appear'd, winding th'eventful avenue, Nearest the church-way, a sepulchral train Amidst the torches light; which to the view Disclos'd a coffin, whose deep-folded pall Six weeping damsels held, while six sad youths Beneath, in sable robes, their burthen bent, Noting the funeral of some gentle maid, Like the sweet snow-drop, earliest child of spring, By the first gale, untimely swept away. The man of sorrow saw, and shudd'ring fell. Ev'n at the bare foot of yon aged tree, The wither'd monument that marks the scene. The stranger lay, cold as the corpse he mourn'd, That corpse so lov'd, so honour'd, so deplor'd! But O! if thou canst pity, hear the tale: If thou canst love, give to th'historic muse Thy list'ning soul, while she in anguish paints Thy changeful dayââO frail mortality!â In Fanny's form, the graces of her heart Were painted fair: her beauty and her worth, Each of excelling kind, were all her dow'r: To fortune born, and not of humble birth. Birth, fortune, and the summer friends they bring, The fools they buy, or flatteries they bribe, By the strong arm of sharp adversity That on her father press'd, were all destroy'd: A narrow cottage, and an ample soul, That would a palace fill with generous deeds, Were now her sire's possessionsâsave a wife, Choice of his youth, and honour of his age, That grac'd his silver hairâsave this fair maid, Pledge of their mutual faith, their mutual joy; Who like a precious gem, from ocean sav'd, Amidst the general wreck, with virtuous hand Lin'd the parental couch with filial down More white, more soft, than what the cygnet drops Upon the summer stream. In hope's fair May, While yet the prospect smil'd, Agenor lov'd, And spoke his welcome flame:âthe blooming youth Was by the blooming maid belov'd again:â But when he saw the smiling prospect low'r, And Fanny's golden hopes upon the wing Of the dark tempest toss'd in desert air, Shrunk he away?âSay, dost thou think he flew Fast as that drenching storm, like the vile slave Whose soul for ever grovels in the dross That stains the mine?âO no! he lov'd the more: And as the chilling gale began to blow, The clouds to gather, and the rain to pour, He drew her nearer to his shelt'ring breast, And spread more wide the refuge of his arms. Who ever purchas'd love, by aught but love? Blush, bankrupt gold, at what is ev'n beyond Thy giant grasp:âHe woo'd her gentle heart, He woo'd and won it:âBy their parents bless'd, Bless'd in themselves, and in their love too bless'd,â Unspotted love,âthey wait the festal hour, That festal hour all redolent with bliss, For which young Fancy twines her fairest wreathe. It comes, it comes! its odorous plumes prepare To spread abroadâfor on the morrow's dawn, (Which soon shall see a blushing rival bloom In Fanny's cheek) all things were fix'd to wed. Ah interval of every soft excess The human heart can prove! suspence divine! Fill'd with each ardent hope and roseate fear, Where Pleasure meets her antient foe, meets Pain, With such unwonted smiles upon his brow, His temples bound with sweet-briar, to denote As well the fragrant leaf as pointed thorn, (Emblem of wedded bliss and misery) Pleasure herself the mystic garland takes, And grants a truce, and is in league with Pain: So soft the sigh, so sweet the tear he brings, When virgin Innocence by manly Truth Is led to Hymen's altar. And ah! see, Behold! the meek eve, that foreruns that morn: âYet, yet awhile, a few thin shades between, âAnd thou art mine for ever;â cried the youth. Meanwhile th'approving sire and aged dame Bestir themselves, with all a parent's zeal, To deck the bridals, and to dress the bower, Fit to receive whom Eden might admit, Where Raphael, with the first betrothed pair Was wont to sit in blissful Paradise Commission'd from above. The redd'ning west Announc'd the setting sun, and mellower tints Painted the firmament: Sirius all day His flaming car had driven along the sky With kindling rage. But now the Breeze of eve, From her cool grotto, ventur'd forth to dip Her feathers in the rill, and in the air To take her twilight circuit: as she shook Her humid pinions, nature felt restor'd Thro' all her works; for valley, hill, and stream, Bird, beast, and man, the balmy essence hail'd! Season of universal calm! all breath'd Ambrosia.âAh! what an hour for loveâ Now almost wedded loveâto steal unseen From all eyes but their own!âSuch sweets to taste, Walk'd forth Agenor and his destin'd bride. Now tell their happiness, ye blessed few Who e'er have felt true passion, felt your hearts Beat quick with transport at the coming dawn, Ev'n as ye seem to reach the dearest point Of all your Fancy ever imag'd fair:â O tell the extacy which now they shar'd, Beneath the lustre of the rising moon, Arm wreath'd in arm, and soul to soul conjoin'd! But who, alas! may trust the coming dawn? Or, for the joys which Fancy paints so fair, Rely upon to-morrow? Who could yet Chain up the tempest? Who, when not a breeze Disturbs the azure surface of the main, Can say, To-morrow shall be calm?âAh me! The goodly hopes of earth, and air, and seas, Are on the mercy of a moment flung; And oftenâwhen their prospects shine most bright, And the believing heart their promises Like nectar quaffs, eager as drinks the lark The sun's first ray, whlle moist with morning dewâ The sweeping whirlwind is most near:âIt comes, (Tears up the cherish'd flower we fondly nurs'd Ev'n in our bosoms, where we saw it bloom With Hope's soft tears bedewing it) it comes, And all is dust:ââO frail humanity!â Lur'd by the song of Philomel, who pour'd Into their souls her solitary chaunt, (Which seem'd to mourn some dear Agenor lost) The lovers wander'd long, and sighing drank Each sorrowing plaint; but as the cadence clos'd, Homeward they wended; yet whene'er the lay, Responsive to the murm'ring of the stream That flow'd beside, renew'd the tuneful woe, As if by spell attracted tow'rds the spot, They linger'd on the brinkâwhen swift the clouds Resum'd the sultry powerâa dead'ning heat Without a sound, and night without a star, Its raven vest and raven omens spread; Trembling the breeze, trembling the moon withdrew: Big, burning drops, where clashing elements, Water and fire, (as if incorporate) Appear'd to blendâthe storm's fierce ministers, Wild, savage winds, fell lightnings, and the powers Of rolling thunder, their dire pastime took In the astonish'd air.âOf nature's works Tremendous, these, to Fanny's gentle soul The mostâher soul tho' innocent and pure As skies without a cloudâfrom the dread shock Of sulphurous combustion she shrunk appall'd. Loud rav'd the hurricane: the first keen flash, Shuddering she saw descend in spiral flame, Then mount and settle on Agenor's breast, Which like a comet stream'd:âa second came, And 'thwart his visage shot a livid glare Corse-like and horrible to human view. âHave mercy, heav'n,â she cried:ââhe dies!âhe dies!â Then shriek'd and ranâran whither? darkness wrapt The troubled pool, save when at intervals, The lightning blaz'dâAgenor mad'ning call'd Th'affrighted fugitive, but call'd in vain, For soon a plunge in the contiguous stream (That stream so placid late, where zephyr bath'd) Was heard, and next a piteous voice that plain'd For instant aid:âthat instant aid to give, Agenor dash'd into th'accursed brook, With piercing tone exclaimingââGod of earth, âOf waters, and of heav'n! O help to save âThis drowning lilly!ââThen with eager stretch That shook the pool he swam, uttering more loud âI come, my soul, I come! O hither turnâ âThis faithful bosom be thy plank to shore, âThese arms extended to their utmost vergeâ âYet ah! they reach thee notâthy safeguard sure!â Mysterious Providence! a different way Poor Fanny floated!âbut at length, with voice Like dying martyr's sweet, she faintly cried, âWhere art thou, love? alas! thy Fanny dies, âBut dies Agenor'sâon his bosom then, âIn his dear arms, O let me breathe my last!â Directed by the sound, the youth now sprung Swifter than light can travel thro' the flood; Her shivering formâin agony of grief, Mix'd with faint hope, he caught, he felt the heart Beat in those faithful armsâthose faithful arms Held, as he reach'd the bank, his Fanny's corpse! Then while he kiss'd the cold clay o'er and o'er, Wild hurrying to the cotâraving, he cried, âO that this vital warmth into thy frame âCould be infus'd, my Fannyâthat this air âWhich feeds my hated life could thine restoreâ âAh! as I breathe into thy pale, pale lip, âRe-animated Beingâdead! quite dead!ââ Prone on the earth, ev'n with her lovely corpse In his embrace, he fellâthen starting rose And hasted onward.âFrantic, to the hut He bore his watry burthenâon the bedâ (By a fond matron's hands so late prepar'd To fold a virtuous pairâwith flow'rets gay, May blooms, and all the incense of the spring, Cull'd by a father's hand) frantic, he laid This lovelier flower than ever Eden grew, Or Paradise could boastâfrantic, he clung Around the breathless body of the maid, In death as life ador'dâand frantic still, Alas! he livesâif life it may be call'd, From fair society shut outâthe pride Of man's supremacy shook from its seat, Yet memory left to tremble o'er the past:â If this be life, he lives; in yonder dome Thou may'st behold the ruins of Agenor, Ruins that ask no fetter, clank no chain: His rage is fledâsad Melancholy's power Has made his breast her mansionâthere she broods And rears her gloomy throneâand mixes sighs, And mingles tears, and blends her groans with his. While Melancholy seems, alas! to love Whom thus she grieves: but he, poor luckless youth, Soften'd by suffering, finds a charm in woe; And oft he calls upon his Fanny lost, And oft in mystic characters he carves Her fancied image on the walls around; Then tells how blest he is, if chance he shapes From straw-made pillow, or from rushy couch, Some gift or garland that may speak his love. Hail to the happier parents!âthey are laid In their pure graves, beside their angel child: And seest thou not, that He whom late we left, At the dread sound of Fanny's passing bell, At the dread view of Fanny's coffin'd pall, Sunk on the bare foot of yon aged tree, Was poor Agenor's self, who phrenzied fled Ere Fanny for her last home from the cot Was mov'd along the firs, where first began Our tender tale:âO frail mortalily! Yet from our tender tale this moral glean:â Ah learn! even in the bosom of delight, To take each proffer'd good with pious awe: Should fair Felicity inviting hold Her nectar'd cup full flowing to thy lip, Let not pale Fear reject the smiling boon, Lest evils may ensueâbut should they come, Should Hope's gay sun which suckles every flower In life's mix'd garden, his bless'd beams withdraw, (Even as the blossoms promise golden fruit) O think on Fanny's and Agenor's life; By their try'd faith and goodness shape thine own; Then, tho' like theirs, thy death be terrible, As dark upon thy startled soul it strike, Here thou mayst suffer:âbut there is no heaven, ( âAnd that there is, all nature cries aloud.â Addison.And that there is, earth, skies, and deeps, declare) There is no God, if goodness such as theirs Meet not eternal recompence above. Cleone sooth'd, and Fancy still a friend, Young Theodorus thus pursued his lay:â Fir-grove farewell!âfor homeward now we bend Our matin step, along the down-hill path That steals into the town: We view the wall, Along whose top the deathless laurel shews Its glossy foliage, sacred to the lyre. With verdure old o'ergrown we note the gate Of Gothic arching, mantled in the moss, With clinging ivy crown'd, and many a shrub That, spurning culture, vegetates on stone, Mineral or spar, or bloom-forbidding rock! Sturdy companions of the barren waste, That artless blossom where the tender flower, Helpless and delicate, would fade and die: Like the soft nursling lillies of the world, That ask the mildest soil, the gentlest breeze, The fondest care, and wither in the storm, Which hardier plants, accustom'd to the wild And season'd to the elements of life, Would brave. Lo! in perspective fair, Contrasting yonder poplars' vivid rows, Where well-arrang'd the vista shines complete, The clust'ring yew-trees wave the funeral branch Of never-changing green;âwhile ancient oaks, Forefathers of the shade, their patriarch arms Stretch 'thwart the dell, where many a fathom down Glooms the still lake, across whose surface dun, Haunted by pensive water-fowl alone, The sable moor-hen housing in the sedge, Or querulous sparrow of the humid reeds) Slopes the sad willow, weeping as she dips, In the dark stream her melancholy boughs. Amidst this varied scenery we sit A world within ourselvesâtill forc'd at last To seek the city, the fair landscape fades Till morning blooms:âSuch, Fancy, are thy gifts; Thus thou redeem'st remembrance of the past, At once delicious, dreadful, sadly dear, Commixture strong of agony and joy, Transcendent both, and cherish'd both by love, Whose very griefs are precious:âTake then, take Thy vot'ry's thanks, pour'd from the fervid heart, And in the desolate hour of absence dear, Be ever present, and be ever kind! Nor deem, ye Maids Pierian, that I slight Your gentle visitations:âye who oft, In the drear hour of dark adversity Have help'd my trembling hands to tune the lyre, And chear'd my pensive spirit with your strains, Sweet as the sounds, and dulcet as the voice Of melting loveâYe whose Ã¦therial harps, Tun'd to the music of your native spheres, Oft, when the passions blew their loudest storm, And keen afflictions roll'd their blackest wave, Have wak'd Compassion's pang-relieving tones, Honied as voice of cherubim, and smoothe As the dove's plumageâev'n the Dove of Peace; Upon whose downy breast, the troubled soul, Lull'd by thy magic song, forgets its rage, Feels it griefs hush'd, and sinks subdu'd to rest. Hail! holy Nine! ye progeny of heav'n! Daughters of Light and Love! fair as the orb That opes the soul of day,âwhose orient beam, With tuneful inspiration fraught, ye quaff, O ever throbbing to your touch divine, Which paints the vest of Spring with brighter hues, Her lily's cup in purer white arrays, Tinges with tenderer pale her cowslip's bell; And on her rose-buds fresher vermeil throws, Beats my fond heart!â'Tis ye, who round the sun, The sun your parentâbind with filial care, A zone more radiant, and from ye the moon Borrows a mellower tint, the air a balm More soft, ocean a greener robe, and earthâ Thro' all her rich domain of wood and stream, Cloud-piercing mountain, and exuberant vale, Fantastic water-fall, and vaulted cave, The glowing powers that gem her central mines, And ev'ry flow'r which on her surface bloomsâ To ye owe grace and beautyâChief your sway Th'obedient Passions feel:âHumanity, Thro' all her wond'rous mazes, to the Muse Heaps tribute large and holy, catching, charm'd, Lofty enthusiasm from her raptur'd lyre. Rous'd by the spirit, breathing in her shell, Forth from the panting heart, her votive train With incense to her beauteous shrine advance; Ambition, as he rushes up the steeps Of tow'ring life, in pride of youthful days, To win the warrior, or the patriot wreath, Midway in his career suspends his step, List'ning the note that swells to honest praise, Then onward presses to the sunny brow, Where Fame awaits to crown him:âMad Revenge, Aw'd by the threat'ning lyre, awakes from dreams, Where his vex'd spirit thro' the troublous night Had toss'd thro' seas of blood, while Murder drew In vision dire th'assassin's reeking bladeâ Soul-soften'd, see he drops the instrument, And weeps upon the breast he meant to stain:â Ev'n Jealousy, that maniac of the mind, His pale lip quiv'ring to his dark intents,â Intents which mark for death the maid he loves,â (Haply for glance misdeem'd, or dubious word, Tortur'd to sense perfidious) should thy voice, Like to th'Almighty fiat, bid the storm Forbear to rage;âO should thou touch the chord, And thro' thy melting lute bid Pity breathe Her softest music of forgiving loveâ The furious youth like one entranced stands, Till streams of tenderest anguish o'er his cheek, Like gentle showers upon the with'ring shrub Smote by the torrid beams of sultry noon, Begin to flow, till lily'd Constancy (That flower of Paradise while bless'd) adorns The idol of his heartâand soon he flies With fond repentance to her faithful arms. Fir'd by th'Ã¦therial Muse, young Genius soars An eagle flight to crop thy own-lov'd plant, Where, foster'd midst the regions of the sun, And water'd by the consecrated stream, It grows to crown the favor'd bard, who wins Thy partial smileâO universal power, 'Tis thine to gild pale Poverty's chill hut, Smooth the dark brow that glooms on wan disease, Thine is the tear of woe, the smile of joy, Of social life thine ev'ry gracious charm; Untutor'd Nature, midst her savage wilds, Carols with artless note thy wond'rous praise; In friendship's sacred bower, and in the path Of rosy love, thy flow'rets sweet diffuse Immortal fragrance, and immortal bloom. Descend then, O inhabitants of heav'n, In all the colours of the glowing morn, When May with fragrance fills the vernal gale! And softâin robes of variegated light, Where blended tints of azure and of gold, With many a silver clouding, forms a couch In yonder sky, I see the train Parnassean, With each the symbol of her magic sway, (Still Fancy grac'd and Honour as their chief) Sit in assemblage fairâLo! now they spread Their burnish'd pinions, by the air upborn; And hark! what music from their vocal shell, Floats on the downy bosom of the breeze: NO more, fond youth the strains prolong, Break off, break off, the plaintive song; With mandate high from spheres above, Our golden harps are strung to Love! In ev'ry flow'r that nature blows, Breeze that fans, and wave that flows; On earth, in ocean, and in air, Love is the sov'reign bliss, the universal prayer. 'Tis Love sustains the starry choir, Love is the elemental fire; Ah! naught in thy mortality, Nor ev'n in our eternity, Like Love can charm, like Love can bless, The sun and soul of happiness; Love is to ev'ry Muse allied, Touches each tuneful chord, and spreads the chorus wide. 'Tis ours to waft the Lover's sighs, Swift to the Nymph for whom they rise; And gently as we strike the string, Convey the Nymph's on rosy wing. Absence, tho' it wounds, endears, Soft its sorrows, sweet its tears; Pains that please, and joys that weep, Trickle like healing balm, and o'er the bosom creep. Love and Sorrow, Twins, were born On a shining show'ry morn, 'Twas in prime of April weather, When it shone and rain'd together; He who never Sorrow knew, Never felt Affections true; Never felt true Passion's power, Love's sun and dew combine, to nurse the tender flow'r. Here ended they their chauntâhere Fancy too Rode on the parting sun-beam: for the moon On her blue throne began with crescent ray To shine, and raptur'd Theodorus now Saw his Cleone speeding to his arms. Thus in the absence of his plumy love, Tender of heart, the Turtle tunes his voice To plainings gentle, and the interval Soothes with a soft consolatory song, While on the tow'ring tree's supremest bough Waving he sits to ken his wand'ring mate: But, lo! at length she cuts the blue profound With wing precipitate and fond, while all The glowing purple of her glossy neck Sun-burnish'd glitters in the beam of day, Then glad he gives his plumage to the breeze, And springs along to welcome her return.</field>
