      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. MISCELLANIES. Christabel. The Introduction to Part the Third. Listen! Ye know that I am mad, And ye will listen!—wizard dreams Were with me—all is true that seems! From dreams alone can truth be had— In dreams divinest lore is taught, For the eye, no more distraught, Rests most calmly; and the ear, Of sound unconscious, may apply Its attributes unknown, to hear The Music of Philosophy! Thus am I wisest in my sleep, For thoughts and things which daylight brings Come to the spirit sad and single; But verse and prose, and joys and woes, Inextricably mingle When the hushed frame is silent in repose! Twilight and moonlight, mist and storm, Black night, and fire-eyed hurricane, And crested lightning, and the snows That mock the sunbeams, and the rain Which bounds on earth with big drops warm, All are round me while I spell The legend of sweet Christabel! —Part Third. Nine moons have waxed, and the tenth in its wane Sees Christabel struggle in unknown pain! For many moons was her eye less bright, For many moons was her vest more tight. And her cheek was pale, save when, with a start, The life-blood came from the panting heart And, fluttering o'er that thin fair face, Past with a rapid, nameless pace; And at moments a big tear filled the eye, And at moments a short and smothered sigh Swelled her breast with sudden strain, Breathed half in grief and half in pain, For hers are pangs on the rack that wind The outward frame and the inward mind. And when at night she did visit the oak, She wore the Baron's scarlet cloak (That cloak which, happy to hear and to tell, Was lined with the fur of the leopard well). And as she wandered down the dell, None said 'twas the Lady Christabel. Some thought 'twas a weird and ugsome elf; Some deemed 'twas the sick old Baron himself, Who wandered beneath the snowy lift To count his beads in solemn shrift (For his shape below was wide to see, All bloated with the hydropsie). Oh, had her old father the secret known, He had stood as stark as the statue of stone That stands so silent and white and tall At the upper end of his banquet-hall! Am I asleep, or am I awake? In very truth I oft mistake, As the stories of old come over my brain, And I build in spirit the mystic strain. Ah! would to the Virgin that I were asleep! But I must wake, and I must weep! Sweet Christabel, it is not well That a lady, pure as the sunless snow That lies so oft on the mountain's brow, That a maiden of sinless chastity In child-birth pangs should be doomed to die, Or live with a name of sorrow and shame, And hear the words of blemish and blame! For the world that smiles at the guilt of man Places woman beneath its ban. Alas! that scandal thus should wreak Its vengeance on the warm and weak; That the arrows of the cold and dull Should wound the heart of the beautiful! Of the things that be, did we know but half, Many and many would weep who laugh! Tears would darken many an eye, Or that deeper grief (when its orb is dry, When it cannot dare the eye of day) O'er the clouded heart would stray Till it crumbled like desert dust away! But here we meet with grief and grudge, And they who cannot know us judge! Thus souls on whom good angels smile Are scoffed at in our world of guile. Let this, Ladie, thy comfort be: Man knows not us; good angels know The things that pass in the world below. And scarce, methinks, it seems unjust That the world should view thee with mistrust; For who that saw that child of thine, Pale Christabel, who could divine That its sire was the Ladie Geraldine? But in I rush, with too swift a gale, Into the ocean of my tale! Not yet, young Christabel, I ween Of her babe hath lighter been. —'Tis the month of the snow and the blast, And the days of Christmas mirth are past, When the oak-roots heaped on the hearth blazed bright, Casting a broad and dusky light On the shadowy forms of the warriors old, Who stared from the wall, most grim to behold; On shields where the spider his tapestry weaves, On the holly boughs and the ivy leaves, The few green glories that still remain To mock the storm and welcome the rain, Brighter and livelier 'mid tempest and shower, Like a hero in the battle hour! Brave emblems o'er the winter hearth, They cheered our fathers' hours of mirth! Twelve solar months complete and clear The magic circle of the year! Each (the ancient riddle saith) Children two times thirty hath! Three times ten are fair and white, Three times ten are black as Night; Three times ten hath Hecatè, Three times ten the God of Day: Thus spoke the old hierophant (I saw her big breast, swelling, pant) What time I dreamed, in ghostly wise, Of Eleusinian mysteries; For I am the hierarch Of the mystical and dark, And now, if rightly I do spell Of the Lady Christabel, She hates the three times ten so white, And sickens in their searching light; And woe is hers—alas! alack! She hates the three times ten so black; As a mastiff bitch doth bark, I hear her moaning in the dark! 'Tis the month of January: Why, lovely maiden, light and airy, While the moon can scarcely glow Through the plumes of falling snow, While the moss upon the bark Is withered all, and damp and dark, While cold above the stars in doubt Look dull, and scarcely will stay out, While the snow is heavy on beechen bower, And hides its namesake, the snowdrop flower, Why walk forth thus mysteriously? Dear girl, I ask thee seriously. Thy cheek is pale, thy locks are wild— Ah, think how big thou art with child! Though the baron's red cloak through the land hath no fellow, Thou shouldst not thus venture without an umbrella! Dost thou wander to the field of graves Where the elder its spectral branches waves; And will thy hurried footsteps halt Where thy mother sleeps in the silent vault? Where the stranger pauses long to explore The emblems quaint of heraldic lore, Where, though the lines are tarnished and dim, Thy mother's features stare gaunt and grim, And grinning skull and transverse bone, And the names of warriors dead and gone, Mark Sir Leoline's burial-stone: Thither go not, or I deem almost That thou wilt frighten thy mother's ghost! Or wilt thou wend to the huge oak-tree, And, kneeling down upon thy knee, Number the beads of my rosary? Nine beads of gold and a tenth of pearl, And a prayer with each, my lovely girl, Nine and one shalt thou record; Nine to the Virgin and one to the Lord! The pearls are ten times one to behold, And ten times nine are the beads of gold: Methinks 'tis hard of the friar to ask On a night like this so weary a task! 'Tis pleasant, 'tis pleasant, in summer time, In the green wood to spell the storied rhyme, When the light winds above 'mong the light leaves are singing, And the song of the birds through your heart is ringing; 'Tis pleasant, 'tis pleasant when happily humming To the flowers below the blythe bee is coming!— When the rivulet, coy and ashamed to be seen, Is heard where it hides 'mong the grass-blades green, When the light of the moon and each starry islet Gives a charm more divine to the long summer twilight, When the breeze o'er the blossomy hawthorn comes cheerful, 'Tis pleasant—with heart, ah! how happy though fearful— With heaven-beaming eyes where tears come while smiles glisten To the lover's low vows in the silence to listen! 'Tis pleasant too on a fine spring day (A month before the month of May) To pray for a lover that's far away! But, Christabel, I cannot see The powerful cause that sways with thee Thus, with a face all waxen white, To wander forth on a winter night. The snow hath ceased, dear lady meek, But the night is chill and bleak; And clouds are passing swift away Below the moon so old and grey— The crescent moon, like a bark of pearl, That lies so calm on the billowy whirl; Rapidly, rapidly With the blast Clouds of ebony Wander fast. And one the maiden hath fixed her eye on Hath passed o'er the moon and is near the horizon! Ah, Christabel, I dread it, I dread it, That the clouds of shame Will darken and gather O'er the maiden's name, Who chances unwedded To give birth to a child, and knows not its father! One—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven!— Tempest or calm, in moonshine or shower, The castle clock still tolls the hour, And the cock awakens, and echoes the sound, And is answered by the owls around; And at every measured tone You may hear the old baron grunt and groan. 'Tis a thing of wonder, of fright, and fear, The mastiff bitches' moans to hear; And the aged cow in her stall that stands, And is milked each morning by female hands (That the baron's breakfast of milk and bread May be brought betimes to the old man's bed, Who often gives, while he is dressing, His Christabel a father's blessing)— That aged cow, as each stroke sounds slow, Answers it with a plaintive low! And the baron old, who is ill at rest, Curses the favourite cat for a pest; For let him pray, or let him weep, She mews through all the hours of sleep, Till the morning comes with its pleasant beams, And the cat is at rest, and the baron dreams. Let it rain however fast, Rest from rain will come at last, And the blaze that strongest flashes Sinks at last, and ends in ashes! But sorrow from the human heart, And mists of care—will they depart? I know not, and I cannot tell, Saith the Lady Christabel; But I feel my bosom swell! In my spirit I behold A lady—call her firm, not bold— Standing lonely by the burn: Strange feelings through her breast and brain Shoot with a sense of madness and pain. Ah, Christabel, return, return; Let me not call on thee in vain! Think, lady dear, if thou art drowned, That thy body will be found. What anguish will thy spirit feel When it must to all reveal What the spell binds thee to conceal! How the baron's heart will knock 'gainst his chest When the stake is driven into thy breast, When thy body to dust shall be carelessly flung, And over the dead no dirge be sung, No friend in mourning vesture dight, No lykewake sad—no tapered rite! Return, return, thy home to bless, Daughter of good Sir Leoline; In that chamber a recess, Known to no other eye than thine, Contains the powerful wild flower wine That often cheered thy mother's heart; Lady, lovely as thou art, Return and, ere thou dost undress And lie down in thy nakedness, Repair to thy secret and favourite haunt And drink the wine as thou art wont, Hard to uncork and bright to decant! My merry girl—she drinks—she drinks; Faster she drinks and faster; My brain reels round as I see her whirl: She hath turned on her heel with a sudden twirl, Wine, wine is a cure for every disaster; For when sorrow wets the eye, Yet the heart within is dry. Sweet maid, upon the bed she sinks: May her dreams be light, and her rest be deep; Good angels guard her in her sleep! Billy Routing. A LYRICAL BALLAD. Fit subject for heroic story, I sing a youth of noble fame; Town and country, ten miles round, Awaken at the glowing sound Of gallant Billy Routing's name! Who wanders 'mid the summer landscape, To scare the crows, for ever shouting? Who makes that sweet harmonious noise, Surpassing far the raven's voice? By heavens 'tis he, 'tis Billy Routing! Billy Routing walketh lamely— Lamely, lamely walketh he; Billy Routing cannot work; You'd swear his leg is made of cork (I never saw him bend his knee). The doctors say he's paralytic Fair certificate he showeth; Billy limpeth through the town, Hawking ballads up and down; Up and down, where'er he goeth. Billy Routing hath a staff, Measuring inches forty-three: Its head is smooth; with leathern string I've seen it from his button swing— (Some say it grew upon a tree!!!) Billy Routing is a sportsman: In summer I have seen him trouting. A poet also is the youth; A player too, for I, in truth, In country barns have heard him spouting. Billy hath a goodly great-coat, I'll take my oath it once was green, Though now it shines of many a hue; A lovelier coat, I'm certain, you On human back have never seen. Now to my tale:—It chanced that Billy Was seven months from his home away; And no one of him heard or saw, Till on the top of blue Skiddaw He landed on a summer day. It chanced on that eventful morning, While walking forth upon the plain, I saw him with my telescope, I saw him on the mountain top, Holding a donkey by the mane! Oh! where have you been, Billy Routing? We dreaded much that thou wast lost; Long did we drag each pond and river, Fearing that thou wert gone for ever, And stuck handbills on every post. And hast thou been in Fairyland, This many a month, this many a day? And hast thou seen the Danish boy? The idiot lad, or Betty Foy? Old Goody Blake, or Lucy Gray? Or hast thou been in Nor-ro-way, Among the mountains gathering leeches? That is a lovely beast of thine; I'm sure its skin would make a fine Soft easy pair of leathern breeches. Now Billy, tell me all your tidings, Now Billy, haste and tell me true. What was his answer, can you tell? With the bold front of Peter Bell, He crowed aloud, “Tu-whit, too-whoo!!!” Note.—Further to illustrate this interesting subject, I have only to observe, that Mr. Routing was a person of an “aspetto nobile;” in his youth he suffered a severe attack of the “eruptio popularis,” commonly hight smallpox; which, it must be confessed, had somewhat impaired the “contorno del suo viso.” From being so much in the sun, his countenance had acquired a tawny—I had almost said—a colour. The most objectionable feature of his inward man, was the “auri sacra fames,” which sometimes “????? ?????” to make free with “les oiseaux domestiques” about farmyards. I remember on speaking to him on this subject, in a friendly manner, he defended himself with this quotation from Plato de Republica, lib. 2. cap. 4, “??? ?????? ??????, ?????? ??????.” I have always chimed in with that opinion, that the sayings of great men, however trivial, are worthy of eternal commemoration. Vide Boswell's Life of Johnson, Hayley's Cowper, &amp;c. Rydal Mount. W. W. “THAT I LOVE THEE, CHARMING MAID,” To its own tune. That I love thee, charming maid, I a thousand times have said, And a thousand times more I have sworn it; But 'tis easy to be seen in the coldness of your mien That you doubt my affection, or scorn it. Ah me! Not a single pile of sense is in the whole of these pretences For rejecting your lover's petitions; Had I windows in my bosom, oh! how gladly I'd expose 'em To undo your phantastic suspicions. Ah me! You repeat I've known you long, and you hint I do you wrong In beginning so late to pursue ye; But 'tis folly to look glum because people did not come Up the stairs of your nursery to woo ye. Ah me! In a grapery one walks without looking at the stalks, While the bunches are green that they're bearing; All the pretty little leaves that are dangling at the eaves Scarce attract even a moment of staring. Ah me! But when time has swell'd the grapes to a richer style of shapes, And the sun has lent warmth to their blushes, Then to cheer us and to gladden, to enchant us and to madden, Is the ripe ruddy glory that rushes. Ah me! Oh 'tis then that mortals pant, while they gaze on Bacchus' plant, Oh 'tis then—will my simile serve ye? Should a damsel fair repine, though neglected like a vine? Both ere long shall turn heads topsy-turvy. Ah me! Song in Praise of Wastle and North. Where'er Odoherty with casual foot Winds through this weary world his varied way, Still be it his with vigour to recruit His toil-worn frame, and moistify his clay With—any potent dram his taste will suit, To toast the health of friends beside the Forth— The dauntless Wastle and the peerless North! Let Southey sing of Thalaba and Roderick, And Scott chaunt forth his epic strains, to tell How Bruce's vessel left the Bay of Broderick, And how, at Flodden, Scotland's ensign fell; Let simple Wordsworth tune on Peter Bell; And Coleridge curdle blood, and stiffen hair, Telling how spirits plagued the Mariner. Let Crabbe rhyme on 'bout vagabonds and flunkeys, Tailors and cobblers, gipsies and their brats, Riding on wicker creels or half-starved donkeys, Their black eyes glancing 'neath their bits of hats; Let Wilson roam to Fairyland: but that's An oldish story; I'll lay half a crown The tiny elves are smothered by his gown. Let missions go to Greenland with Montgomery; Let green-sick ladies sonnetize with Bowles; Let Leigh Hunt sing of cabbages and flummery, And currant-bushes blooming on green knowls; Let Keats draw out his whinings into growls; Let Corney Webbe write sonnets by the score, “And trample wounded Time upon the floor.” Let Shelley sing of darknesses and devilry, Till earth grows Pandemonium at his touch; Let Tommy Moore, that son and soul of revilry, Praise Indians and fire-worshippers, and such: To stretch our thoughts so far is rather much; Although to spend an hour we do not grudge With Twopenny Post-bags, Crib, and Betty Fudge. Let Mrs. Hemans chaunt historic tales Till Cader Idris echoes back the strain; Let Missy Mitford spread adventurous sails Far south, and sing Cristina of the Main; Miss Horford now may visit Falkirk plain In safety; as the only danger there Is meeting with wild cattle at the fair. Let Mrs. Opie sing of orphan boys, Whose sires were shot with slug at Trafalgar; Let Lady Morgan cant, and make a noise, With Lindley Murray and good sense at war; Miss Baillie no doubt is a shining star: But unto none I will attend, unless— What is the sine quâ non? Only guess. Unless in Blackwood's pine-tree grove he flourish, Writing an article for every number, With fun and frolic. These are things that nourish The heart of man, and keep his eyes from slumber. I like none of your melancholy lumber, Your sonnets and your sentimental tales, As tardy of digestion as brass nails. You see I'm tainted with the metromanie, And not a little proud of innovation: I'll have original verse as well as any, And not think there's any great occasion To write like Frere and Byron. When the nation Talks of the seven-line stanza, they shall cry— Aye! that's the stanza of Odoherty! POCOCURANTE [Here's a health to thee, Margaret] Here's a health to thee, Margaret, Here's a health to thee; The drinkers are gone, And I am alone, So here's a health to thee. Chevy Chase; A POEM— 1. The Percy out of Northumberland, I have modernised the spelling of the old ballad. And a vow to God made he, That he would hunt in the mountains Of Cheviot within days three, In the mauger of doughty Douglas, And all that with him be. 2. The fattest harts in Cheviot He said he'd kill and carry away: “By my faith,” said doughty Douglas, “I'll let that hunting if I may.” 3. The Percy out of Bamborough came, With him a mighty meany; With fifteen hundred archers bold; They were chosen out of shires three. 4. This began on Monday at morn, In Cheviot the hills so high; The child may rue that is unborn; It is the more pity! 5. The drivers through the woods went, For to raise up the deer; Bowmen bickered upon the bent With their broad arrows clear. 6. Then the wild through the woods went, On every side sheer; Greyhounds through the groves glent, For to kill their deer. 7. This began in Cheviot the hills above, Early on a Monday; By that it drew to the hour of noon, A hundred fat harts dead there lay. 8. They blew a mort upon the bent; They 'sembled on sides sheer: To the quarry then the Percy went, To see the brittling of the deer. 9. He said—“It was the Douglas' promise This day to meet me here, But I wist he would fail verament:” A great oath the Percy sware. 10. At last a squire of Northumberland Looked at his hand full nigh— He was ware of the Douglas coming, With him a mighty meany; 11. Both with spear, bill, and brand, It was a mighty sight to see; Hardier men of heart and hand Were not in Christianity. 12. They were twenty hundred spearmen good, Withouten any fail; They were borne along by the water of Tweed, In the bounds of Tividale. 13. “Leave off the brittling of the deer,” he said, “And to your bows take heed; For never since you were on your mothers born Had ye such meikle need.” 14. The doughty Douglas on a steed He rode his men beforne; His armour glittered as did a glede— A bolder bairn was never born. 15. “Tell me what men ye are,” he says, “Or whose men that ye be; Who gave ye leave to hunt in this Cheviot Chase in spite of me?” 16. The first man that an answer made, It was the Lord Percy— “We will not tell what men we are, Nor whose men that we be; But we will hunt here in this chase, In spite of thine and thee. 17. “The fattest harts in Cheviot We have killed, and cast to carry away.” “By my troth,” said the doughty Douglas, “Therefore the one of us shall die this day.” 18. Then said the doughty Douglas Unto the Lord Percy, “To kill all these guiltless men, Alas! it were great pity. 19. “But, Percy, thou art a lord of land, I am an earl in my own country; Let all our men upon a party stand, And do the battle of thee and me.” 20. “Now Christ's curse on his crown,” said the Lord Percy, “Whosoever thereto says nay! By my troth, doughty Douglas,” he says, “Thou shalt never see that day, 21. “Neither in England, Scotland, nor France, Nor for no man of woman born; But an fortune be my chance, I dare meet him one for one.” 22. Then bespake a squire of Northumberland, Rog. Witherington was his name— It shall never be told in South England To King Harry the Fourth for shame, 23. “I wot ye be great lords two, I am a poor squire of land, I will never see my captain fight in a field And look on myself and stand; In Bishop Percy—“And stand myself and look on.” But correct it, meo periculo. But while I may my weapon wield, I will not fail both heart and hand.” 24. That day, that day, that dreadful day— The first fytte here I find; An ye will hear more of the hunting of Cheviot, Yet there is more behind. FINIS PARTIS PRIMÆ. Second Fytte. 1. I have, as before, modernised the spelling of the old ballad, and in a few places the language.—W. M. The English men had their bows bent, Their hearts were good enow, The first i.e., first flight. Percy.—W. M. of arrows that they shot off, Seven score spearmen they slew. 2. Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent, A captain good enough: And that was seen verament, For he wrought them wo and wouch. 3. The Douglas parted his host in three, Like a chief chieftain of pride; With sure spears of mighty tree, They came in on every side. 4. Through our English archery Gave many a wound full wide; Many a doughty they made to die, Which gained them no pride. 5. The English men let their bows be, And pulled out brands that were bright; It was a heavy sight to see Bright swords on helmets light. 6. Through rich mail and myne-ye-ple “Perhaps many plies or folds. Monyple is still used in this sense in the north, according to Mr. Lambe.” Bp. Percy. I have followed him.— W. M. Many stern they struck down straight; Many a ficke that was full free There under foot did light. 7. At last the Douglas and the Percy met, Like two captains of might and main; They swept together, till they both sweat, With swords of fine Milain. Swords made of Milan steel. Percy.—W. M. 8. These worthy fickes for to fight, Thereto they were full fain, Till the blood out of their helmets sprung, As ever did hail or rain. 9. “Hold thee, Percy,” said the Douglas, “And i' faith I will thee bring, Where thou shalt have an earl's wages Of James, our Scottish king: 10. “Thou shalt have thy ransom free— I bid thee hear this thing; For the manfullest man art thou, That ever I conquered in field-fighting.” 11. “Nay, then,” said the Lord Percy, “I told it thee beforne, That I would never yielded be To no man of woman born.” 12. With that there came an arrow hastily Forth of a mighty one; It hath stricken the Earl Douglas In at the breast-bone. 13. Through liver and lungs both The sharp arrow is gone; That never after in his life days He spake more words than one: From this it appears that Jerry-Benthamism is of an older date than the superficial commonly imagine. Fight-you-my-merry-men-while-you- may-for-my-life-days-are-gone; or, as the original has it, Fyghte-ye-my- merry-men-whylles-ye-may-for-my-lyff-days-ben-gan, is as pretty a single word as any we can find in the lucid pages of this most Euphuistical radical, and most radical Euphuist, who commonly passes in our days for the inventor of the many-words-clubbing-to-make-one style. We have here a much older authority; so that Jerry must be set down as one of the servum pecus in that instance.—W. M. “Fight ye my merry men while you may, For my life days are gone.” 14. The Percy leant upon his brand, And saw the Douglas die; He took the dead man by the hand, And said, “Woe is me for thee. 15. “To have saved thy life I'd have parted with My lands for years three; For a better man of heart nor hand Was not in all the north country.” 16. Of all that saw a Scottish knight, Was named Sir Hugh Montgomery; He saw the Douglas to death was dight; He spanned a spear a trusty tree. 17. He rode upon a courser Through an hundred archery; He never stinted nor never stopped Till he came to the good Lord Percy. 18. He set upon Lord Percy A dint that was full sore, With a sure spear of a trusty tree, Clean through the body he the Percy bore. 19. At the other side that a man might see A large cloth-yard and mare. Two better captains were not in Christianty Than that day slain was there. 20. An archer of Northumberland Saw slain was the Lord Percy; He bare a bent bow in his hand, Was made of trusty tree. 21. An arrow that a cloth-yard long, To the hard steel haled he; A dint that was both sad and sore He set on Sir Hugh Montgomery. 22. The dint it was both sad and sore That he on Montgomery set; The swan-feathers that his arrow bore With his heart's-blood were wet. 23. There was never a ficke one foot would fly, But still in storm did stand, Hewing on each other while they might drie With many a baleful band. 24. This battle began on Cheviot, An hour before the noon, And when even song-bell was rung, The battle was not half done. 25. They took on, on either hand, By the light of the moon; Many had no strength to stand, In Cheviot the hills aboun. 26. Of fifteen hundred archers of England Went away but fifty and three: Of twenty hundred spearmen of Scotland But even five and fifty. 27. But all were slain, Cheviot within, They had no strength to stand on high; The child may rue that is unborn; It was the more pity. 28. There was slain with the Lord Percy Sir John of Agerstone, Sir Roger, the kind Hartley, Sir William the bold Heron. 29. Sir George the worthy Lovel, A knight of great renown, Sir Ralph, the rich Rokeby, With dints were beaten down. 30. For Withrington my heart is wo, That ever he slain should be: For when his legs were hewn in two, He knelt, and fought upon his knee. 31. There was slain with the doughty Douglas Sir Hugh Montgomery, Sir David Liddel, that worthy was, His sister's son was he. 32. Sir Charles Murray in that place, That never a foot would fly; Sir Hugh Maxwell, a lord that was, With the Douglas did he die. 33. So on the morrow they made them biers Of birch and hazel gray; Many widows, with weeping tears, Came to fetch their mates away. 34. Tividale may carp of care! Northumberland may make great moan! For two such captains, as slain were there, Of the march party shall never be none. 35. Word is come to Edinburgh, To James the Scottish king, That doughty Douglas, lieutenant of the march, He lay slain Cheviot within. 36. His hands did he weal and wring, He said, “Alas! and wo is me! Such another captain Scotland within,” He said, “I'faith shall never be.” 37. Word is come to lovely London, To the Fourth Harry our king, That Lord Percy, lieutenant of the marches, He lay slain Cheviot within. 38. “God have mercy on his soul,” says King Harry, “Good Lord if thou will it be! I have a hundred captains in England As good as ever was he. But, Percy, an I brook my life, Thy death well quit shall be.” 39. As our noble king made his avow, Like a noble prince of renown, For the death of the Lord Percy, He did the battle of Humbledown. 40. Where six-and-thirty Scottish knights On a day were beaten down; Glendale glittered with their armour bright, O'er castle, tower, and town. 41. (This Bp. Percy suspects these two verses, 41, 42, to be spurious. So do I, as they stand at present; but I think we might make a good verse out of the two, thus:This was the hunting of the Cheviot, Upon a Monday; There was the doughty Douglas slain, The Percy never went away. This will get off the confusion with regard to the battle of Otterburn, and strange language of these verses. Percy's interpretation of “That tear began this spurn,” is, “That tearing or pulling occasioned this spurn or kick.” I have followed him, though I confess I am not satisfied with it. —W. M. was the bunting of the Cheviot; That tear began this spurn; Old men, that knew the ground well enough, Call it the battle of Otterburn. 42. At Otterburn began this spurn Upon a Monday; There was the doughty Douglas slain, The Percy never went away.) 43. There never was a time on the march parties, Since the Douglas and the Percy met, But it was marvel an the red blood ran not As the rain does on the street. 44. Jesus Christ our i.e. Better our bales, remedy our evils. Bp. Percy.—W.M. bales bete, And to the bless us bring! This was the hunting of the Cheviot; God send us all good ending! Expliceth Richard Sheale The author of this ballad, as the reader may see by the expliceth, is Richard Sheale, a gentleman not to be confounded, as honest old Tom Hearne has done, with a Richard Sheale who was living in 1588. Nor is he to be confounded with a Richard Sheil who is alive in 1820, writing tragedies and other jocose performances. I waive the objection arising from Chronology, as that is a science I despise, therein imitating Lady Morgan, the Edinburgh Reviewers, Major Cartwright, and various other eminent persons. For (to take one instance from the works of the firstcited authority) might not Mr. Richard Sheil of 1820 be as capable of writing a ballad in the days of Henry VI. as the wife of the Grand Condè of intriguing with a king who was dead before she was born? (See, if extant, Lady Morgan's France.) My objections to their identity are of a graver and more critical nature. 1st, Richard Sheil of Chevy Chase is an original writer, which nobody accuses Richard Sheil of Evadne of being. 2ndly, Although in verse 33, Second Fytte, the ballad-monger had an opportunity of bringing up the children with their mothers, to serve as a clap trap, he has not done so; an omission of which the tragedy-monger of Ballemira would never have been guilty. 3dly, The people in the poem of the rhymester are decent men, who talk plain language; whereas the people in The Apostate are stalking-talking rogues, who discourse in the most sarsenet phraseology. 4thly and lastly, The ballad of the Percy and Douglas (teste Sir P. Sidney) moves the heart like the sound of a trumpet, whereas the tragedy of Adelaide puts one to sleep more effectually than a double dose of diacodium. Wherefore I am of opinion that Mr. R. Sheil now extant is not the author of Chevy Chase. Q. E. D.—W. M. temp. Henr. VI. END OF VOL. I</field>

PROEMIUM. 1 The poet flabbergasted by ane strange apparition. As I was sitting on the Shannon side, Lulled by the sound of that majestic flood, A horseman on a sudden I espied, Galloping by as quickly as he could. I hailed him, but he slackened not his pace, Still urging on his steed, a gallant grey, Until he passed me; then he turned his face, Back towards his horse's tail, and thus did say: “I ride express with news to strike you dumb. Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth is come!” 2 Which leaveth him in ane awkward doldrum, after the manner of W. Words-worth, Esq. He scarce had spoken ere away he passed Out of my sight as rapid as a bird, And left me there in much amazement cast, Looking, perhaps, in some degree absurd. The noble river rolling calmly by, The horse, the hasty rider, all did seem, Even to the vision of my outward eye, Like the thin shadowy figments of a dream. I felt, in short, as Wordsworth did, when he Chanced the leech-gatherer on the moor all by himself to see. 3 Shaketh it off, and marcheth homewards. By the exertion of judicious thought, At last I from this mental trance awoke, Marvelling much how in that lonely spot Upon my eyes so strange a vision broke; From the green bank immediately I went, And into Limerick's ancient city sped. During my walk, with puzzled wonderment I thought on what the rapid horseman said; And, as is commonly the case, when I Feel any way oppressed in thought, it made me very dry. 4 Turnethstargazer. When I arrived in brick-built George's Street, Instinctively I there put forth my hand To where a bottle, stored with liquid sweet, Did all upon an oaken table stand; Then turning up my little finger strait, I gazed like Doctor Brinkley on the sky, Whence heavenly thought I caught—pure and elate Of holy harpings of deep poesy; And, ere a moment its brief flight could wing, I threw the empty bottle down, to chant about the King. Ode. 1 He calleth upon Ireland to rejoice in the fashion of a pot of porter. A very glorious day this is indeed! This is indeed a very glorious day! For now our gracious monarch will proceed On Irish ground his royal foot to lay. Rejoice, then, O my country, in a tide Of buoyant, foaming, overflowing glee; As swells the porter o'er the gallon's side, So let your joy swell up as jovially. Shout, great and little people, all and some, Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come! 2 Inviteth the mountains to ane saraband. Come down, ye mountains, bend your numbsculls low, Ye little hills run capering to the shore, Now on your marrow-bones, all in a row, From all your caves a royal welcome roar. Howth is already at the water-side, Such is that loyal mountain's duteous haste; Come then to join him, come with giant stride, Come, I repeat, there's little time to waste. In your best suits of green depart from home, For now our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come! 3 Maketh of them ane catalogue most musical. Down should despatch Morne's snowy-vested peaks, And Tipperary, Knocksheogowna's Which, being interpreted, signifies, the hill of the fairy calf; there is many a story about it.—M. OD. hill, Kerry, the great Macgillycuddy's reeks, Cork, the Galtees, studded with many a still. Gallop from Wicklow, Sugarloaf the sweet! From Wexford, bloody Vinegar Vinegar Hill, where a decisive battle was fought in 1798 with the rebels, who were totally defeated.—M. OD. the sour! Croagh Croagh-Patrick, in Mayo.—M. OD. must be there, from whose conspicuous seat St. Patrick made the snakes from Ireland scour: All, all should march, tramp off to beat of drum, For now our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come! 4 A word of advice to the rivers, in the style of Master Edmund Spenser, late of Kilcolman. Rivers, dear rivers, in meandering roll Move to your Sovereign merrily along; Ye whom the mighty minstrel of old Mole Spenser, who dwelt beneath old father Mole,(Mole hight that mountain gray That walls the north side of Armulla vale.) Collin Cloutt's come home again. He has catalogued our rivers in the Faëry Queen, B. 4. Cant. 2. St. 40-44. —M. OD. Has all embalmed in his enchanting song; Liffey shall be your spokesman, roaring forth A very neat Address from either Bull, In Dublin Bay are two sand-banks, called the North and South Bulls. Not far from them is a village called Ring's-End, which gives occasion to the facete to say that you enter Dublin between two bulls and a blunder. —M. OD.

But all the other loughs, where'er they be, From mighty Neagh, Est aliud stagnum quod facit ligna durescere in lapides; homines autem findunt ligna, et postquam formaverunt in eo usque ad caput anni, et in capite anni lapis invenitur, et vocatur Loch-Each, ac (Lough Neagh). See Mirab. Hib.—M. OD. the stone-begetting lake, To Corrib, Swilly, Gara, Dearg, or Rea, Or Googaun-Barra, i.e. The hermitage of St. Finbar, who lived there as a recluse. He was first Bishop of Cork. It is a most beautiful and romantic lake, containing a pretty island. It is a great place of pilgrimage.—M. OD. when the Lee doth take Its lively course, join in the general hum: “Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” 6 Lealty of the bogs. O ye blest bogs, Everybody has heard of the movement of the Irish bogs.—M. OD. true sons of Irish soil, How can I e'er your loyal zeal express? You have already risen, despising toil, And travelled up, your Sovereign to address. Clara has led the way, immortal bog, Now Killmalady follows in his train; Allen himself must soon to join them jog From Geashil barony with might and main, In turfy thunders, shouting as they roam: “Our Sovereign has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” 7 Ane caution to the Giant's Causeway not to tread upon the learned weavers of Belfast. Ha! what's this woful thumping that I hear? Oh! 'tis the Giant's Causeway moving on, Heavily pacing, with a solemn cheer, On clumsy hoofs of basalt octagon. (Gigantic wanderer! lighter be your tramp, Or you may press our luckless cities down; 'Twould be a pity, if a single stamp Smashed bright Belfast—sweet linen-vending town). Why have you travelled from your sea-beat dome? “Because our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come!” 8 Showinghow Cape Clear becometh ane Marcus Tullius. Last slopes in, sailing from the extremest south, Gallant Cape Clear, a most tempestuous isle; Certain am I that, when she opes her mouth, She will harangue in oratoric style. So North and South, and East and West combine, Ulster, The five ancient kingdoms of Ireland.—M. OD. and Connaught, Leinster, Munster, Meath, To hail the King, who, first of all his line, Was ever seen old Ireland's sky beneath. All shall exclaim, for none shall there be mum: “Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” L'Envoy. 1 Mocke commendation on various folk. How living people joy, I shall not tell, Else I should make my song a mile in length; Plebeian bards that theme may answer well, Chanting their lays with pertinacious strength: They may describe how all, both man and beast, Have in the general glee respective shares; How equal merriment pervades the breast Of sharks and lawyers—asses and Lord Mayors— Of whelps and dandies—orators and geese— In short, of every living thing, all in their own degrees. 2 Where it is earnestly requested of the poets of Dublin, not to slay the King after the fashion of Ankerstroem or Ravaillac. But ye, remorseless rhymesters, spare the King! Have some compassion on your own liege Lord! Oh! it would be a most terrific thing Were he to death by Dublin poets bored. See! Three sweet singers out of College bray, And all the aldermen have hired a bard; The Castle, too, its ode, I ween, will pay, And the newspapers have their pens prepared. Be silent, then, and mute, ye unpaid fry! Let none attempt to greet the King save such great bards as I. II.A WELCOME TO HIS MAJESTY. Tune—Groves of Blarney. 1 You're welcome over, my royal rover, Coming in clover to Irish ground; You'll never spy land like this our island, Lowland or Highland, up or down! Our hills and mountains, our streams and fountains, Our towns and cities all so bright, Our salt-sea harbours, our grass-green arbours, Our greasy larders will glad your sight. 2 'Tis here you'll eat, too, the gay potato, Being a root to feed a king; And you'll get frisky upon our whisky, Which, were you dumb, would make you sing; And you'll see dashers, and tearing slashers, Ready to face ould Beelzebub, Or the devil's mother, or any other Person whom you desire to drub. 3 Just say the word, and you'll see a riot Got up so quiet and polite, At any minute you'd please to wish it, Morning or evening, noon or night. I'll lay a wager, no other nation Such recreation to you could show As us, all fighting with great good manners, Laying one another down so low. 4 And as for music, 'tis you'll be suited With harp or bagpipe, which you please; With woful melting, or merry lilting, Or jovial quilting your heart to raise. Sweet Catalani won't entertain you With so much neatness of warbling tone, As those gay swipers, or bold bagpipers, Chanting in splendour over their drone. 5 Then there's our speaking, and bright speech-making, Which, when you hear, 'twill make you jump; When in its glory it comes before you, 'Twould melt the heart of a cabbage stump. 'Tis so met'phoric and paregoric, As fine as Doric or Attic Greek, 'Twould make Mark Tully look very dully, Without a word left in his cheek. 6 If any ladies they should invade us, The darling creatures in your suite, To be pronounced Hibernically—shoot. We'll so amuse them, and kindly use them, That in ould Ireland they'll take root. Our amorous glances, modest advances, And smiling fancies, and all that, Will so delight them that they'll be crying, Were you to part them away from Pat. 7 The mayors and sheriffs, in paunchy order, And the recorders will go down To gay Dunleary, all for to cheer ye, And give you welcome to the town; But though their speeching it may be pleasing, All written out in comely paw, 'Twon't be so hearty as when all parties With million voices roar Huzza! 8 God bless your heart, sir, 'tis you will start, sir, At that conspicuous thundering shout, When Ireland's nation, with acclamation, To hail their Sovereign will turn out. England shall hear us, though 'tis not near us, And the Scotch coast shall echo ring, When we, uproarious, joining in chorus, Shout to the winds, God Save the King! III. ODOHERTY'S IMPROMPTU. My landlady enter'd my parlour, and said, “Bless my stars, gallant Captain, not yet to your bed? The kettle is drain'd and the spirits are low, Then creep to your hammock, O go, my love, go! Derry down, &amp;c. “Do look at your watch, sir, 'tis in your small pocket, 'Tis three, and the candles are all burned to the socket: Come move, my dear Captain, do take my advice, Here's Jenny will pull off your boots in a trice. Derry down,” &amp;c. Jenny pull'd off my boots, and I turned into bed, But scarce had I yawned twice, and pillowed my head, When I dreamed a strange dream, and what to me befell I'll wager a crown you can't guess ere I tell. Derry down, &amp;c. Methought that to London, with sword at my side, On my steed Salamanca in haste I did ride, That I enter'd the Hall, 'mid a great trepidation, And saw the whole fuss of the grand Coronation. Derry down, &amp;c. Our Monarch, the King, he was placed on the throne, 'Mid brilliants and gold that most splendidly shone; And around were the brave and the wise of his Court, In peace to advise, and in war to support. Derry down, &amp;c. First Liverpool moved at his Sovereign's command; Next Sidmouth stepped forth with his hat in his hand; Then Canning peeped round with the archness of Munden, And last, but not least, came the Marquis of London- derry down, &amp;c. Then Wellington, hero of heroes, stepped forth; Then brave Graham of Lynedoch, the cock of the north; Then Hopetoun he followed, but came not alone, For Anglesey's leg likewise knelt at the throne. Derry down, &amp;c. But the King looked around him, as fain to survey, When the warlike departed, the wise of the day; And he whisper'd the herald to summon in then The legion of Blackwood, the brightest of men! Derry down, &amp;c. Oh noble the sight was, and noble should be The strain that proclaims, mighty legion, of thee! The tongue of an angel the theme would require, A standish of sunbeams, a goose-quill of fire. Derry down, &amp;c. Like old Agamemnon, resplendent came forth, In garment embroidered, great Christopher North: He knelt at the throne, and then turning his head,— “These worthies are at the King's service,” he said. Derry down, &amp;c. “Oh, Sire! though your will were as hard to attain As Gibraltar of old to the efforts of Spain, The men who surround you will stand, and have stood, To the last dearest drop of their ink and their blood. Derry down, &amp;c. “From the Land's End to far Johnny Groat's, if a man, From Cornwall's rude boots to the MacAllister's clan, Dare raise up his voice 'gainst the Church or the State, We have blisters by dozens to tickle his pate, Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Morris, the potent physician of Wales, And Tickler, whose right-handed blow never fails, And him who from loyalty's path never wander'd, Himself, swate Odoherty, knight of the standard. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have sage Kempferhausen, the grave and serene; And Eremus Marischall from far Aberdeen; Hugh Mullion, the Grassmarket merchant so sly, With his brethren Malachi and Mordecai. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have also James Hogg, the great shepherd Chaldean, As sweetly who sings as Anacreon the Teian; We have Delta, whose verses as smooth are as silk; With bold William Wastle, the laird of that ilk. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Dr. Pendragon, the D.D. from York, Who sports in our ring his huge canvas of cork; And General Izzard, the strong and the gruff, Who despatches his foes with a kick and a cuff. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Seward of Christchurch, with cap and with gown, A prizeman, a wrangler, and clerk of renown; And Buller of Brazen-nose, potent to seek A blinker for fools, from the mines of the Greek. Derry down, &amp;c. “Nicol Jarvie from Glasgow, the last and the best Of the race who have worn a gold chain at their breast; And Scott, Jamie Scott, Dr. Scott, a true blue, Like the steel of his forceps as tough and as true. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Cicero Cowden, who sports by the hour, Of all the tongue-waggers the pink and the flower; And Jennings the bold, who has challenged so long All the nation for brisk soda-water and song.” Derry down, &amp;c. Methought that the king looked around him and smiled; Every phantom of fear from his breast was exiled, For he saw those whose might would the demagogue chain, And would shield from disturbance the peace of his reign. Derry down, &amp;c. But the best came the last, for with duke and with lord Methought that we feasted, and drank at the board, Till a something the bliss of my sweet vision broke— 'Twas the watchman a-bawling, “'Tis past ten o'clock.” Derry down, &amp;c. But, before I conclude, may each man at his board Be as glad as a king, and as drunk as a lord; There's nothing so decent, and nothing so neat, As, when rising is past, to sit down on your seat. Derry down, &amp;c. [“? How comes this hair undone?] “? How comes this hair undone? Its wandering strings must be what blind me so, And yet I tied it fast!!? The sunshine on the floor is black! The air Is changed to vapours, such as the dead breathe In charnel pits! Poh! I am choked! There creeps A clinging, black, contaminating mist About me—'tis substantial, heavy, thick. I cannot pluck it from me, for it glues My fingers and my limbs to one another, And eats into my sinews, and dissolves My flesh to a pollution,” &amp;c. &amp;c. [“And in its depths there is a mighty rock] “And in its depths there is a mighty rock, Which has, from unimaginable years, Sustained itself with terror and with toil! Over a gulph, and with the agony With which it clings, seems slowly coursing down; Even as a wretched soul, hour after hour, Clings to the mass of life, yet clinging leans, And, leaning, makes more dark the dread abyss In which it fears to fall. Beneath this crag, Huge as despair, as if in weariness, The melancholy mountain yawns below,” &amp;c. &amp;c. [“O weep for Adonais! He is dead!] “O weep for Adonais! He is dead! Weep, melancholy mother, wake and weep; Yet wherefore? quench within their burning bed Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep, Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep, For he is gone, where all things wise and fair Descend! Oh dream not that the amorous deep Will yet restore him to the vital air. Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.” [“Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down] “Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down Her kindling buds, as if the Autumn were, Or they dead leaves, since her delight is flown, For whom would she have waked the sullen year? To Phœbus was not Hyacinth so dear, Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both, Thou, Adonais; wan they stand, and sere, Amid the drooping comrades of their youth, With dew all turned to tears, odour to sighing ruth.” Absurdity. The green lizard, and the golden snake, Like unimprisoned flowers out of their trance awake. An hour— Say, with me Died Adonais, till the Future dares Forget the Past—his fate and fame shall be An echo and a light to all eternity. Whose tapers yet burn there the night of Time, For which suns perished! Echo,—pined away Into a shadow of all sounds. That mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit! Comfortless! As silent lightning leaves the starless night. Live thou whose infamy is not thy fame! Thou noteless blot on a remembered name! We in mad trance strike with our spirit's knife Invulnerable nothings! Where lofty thought Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair, And love, and life, contend in it—for what Shall be its earthly doom—The dead live there, And move, like winds of light, on dark and stormy air. Who mourns for Adonais—oh! come forth, Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright, Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth! Dart thy spirit's light Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might Satiate the void circumference! Then sink Even to a point within our day and night, And keep thy heart light, lest it make thee sink, When hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the brink. A light is past from the revolving year; And man and woman, and what still is dear Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither. That benediction which th' eclipsing curse Of birth can quench not, that sustaining love Which, through the web of being blindly wove By man, and beast, and earth, and air, and sea, Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of The fire for which all thirst. [He is, “The coming bulk of Death,”] He is, “The coming bulk of Death,” Then “Death feeds on the mute voice.” A clear sprite Reigns over Death— Kingly Death Keeps his pale court. Spreads apace The shadow of white Death. The damp Death Quenched its caress— Death Blushed to annihilation! Her distress Roused Death. Death rose and smiled— He lives, he wakes, 'tis Death is dead! The Writer Tam. By T. Dromedary. The Writer Tam, from Hungryland, See Jack Wilkes' Prophecy of Famine, a poem, as Tom himself observes, amusing to a Scotchman from its extravagance. To oblige him, therefore, the name is adopted here.—M. OD. Comes, famed for lays of arms, The Mariners of England, The British Grenadiers, The Battle of the Baltic, &amp;c.—M. OD. And, writing chaunts of chivalry, The Cockney ladies charms. While other hands write Balaam, he, In editorial gloom, In Colburn's magazinary, Gives each his destined room. Two Sonnets on a late Soaring Expedition to the Lords. BY SIR MORGAN ODOHERTY, BART. I.ON SPRING RICE, IN THE CHARACTER OF GANYMEDE. When, as the poets sing, high-judging Jove In plenitude of premiership decreed To give, with grace, his favourite Ganymede From earth—the lower House—a kindly shove, In pitchfork fashion, to the House above, He sent his own brave bird, with hastiest speed, Upon that noble mission to proceed: Down swooping from the sky the eagle drove, And caught the youth, and upward towered again, Into Jove's court of peers. As fine a flight Has Rice, the soaring Superficial, ta'en At Melbourne's bidding. Therefore doth the wight, In order that his name should be en règle, Choose Ganymede as type, and write himself Monteagle. II.ON SPRING RICE, IN THE CHARACTER OF DANIEL O'ROURKE. But not alone to Ganymede in fame Is our up-springing statesman like. Another Proud hero of romance, an Irish brother (See Crofty Croker), Dan O'Rourke by name, Has in his flying match done much the same. Dan, from a dirty bog where he was sticking, Bothering and sweating, bungling, blundering, kicking —A mock to all, a thing of jeer and game— Mounted an eagle, and so reached the moon: So Spring, all floundering in the dismal mass Of his Exchequer blundering, hailed the boon Which his Mount-Eagle sent him in distress. But better Rice than Rourke has done the trick, Because John Bull, not he, has played the lunatic.</field>
