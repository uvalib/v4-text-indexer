      <field name="fulltext">To my esteemed friend JAMES HOBARTE of Hales in the County of Norfolke, Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Muse. Tell me presumptuous Muse how dar'st thou treat Upon a Subject so sublime, so great! Alas how dare thy infancy aspire So high as Heaven, where the cælestial quire Of soul-enchanting Angels, howrely sing, Anthems of Joy to their mellifluous King! This is a task that invocates the best And loftiest quils; Heav'ns love must b'exprest With wanton language: he that shall presume To labour in this worke, must first perfume His Soul With true Divinity, and breathe Celestial ayres, that Readers may perceive Their Authour labours with a serious heart T'embalm his actions with divinest art; This is a field whose spacious bounds extend Themselves to infinite; who strives to end Shall still begin, and having once begun This pleasing progress, must not cease to run Untill he stops in Heaven, there lyes the gain, Who runs with Faith is certain to obtain. If then my Muse, thou canst divinely mount This Sacred Stage, thou needst not fear t'account Thy actions prosperous, strive thou to stand Guarded with Faith, and Heav'n will lend a hand To prop thee up, his power will infuse Sufficient matter for an active Muse To work upon, his wisdome will direct Thy painfull hand, his mercies will correct Thy rambling thoughts, and teach thee to proclaim Th'unsumm'd up glories of his Royall Name; Abandon earth, and bid vain thoughts adieu Thou canst not serve thy God and Mammon too; Rouse then, and let thy well-prun'd Eagles Wings Mount thee aloft, let not terrestiall things Disturb thy resolutions, let them all Evade thy minde; thy thoughts must grow too tall For such low toies: stirre up thy zealous fire, And what thou canst not well expresse, admire. DIVINE MEDITATIONS Upon severall subjects. I. [Groans, midnight groans, usurp the Commonwealth] Groans, midnight groans, usurp the Commonwealth, Oh my infringed Soule! I know no health, Nor feel no pleasure, all my joyes are fled I know not where, and I am worse than dead. Heav'n-shouldring Atlas, if compar'd to me Beares nothing, mines a weighty misery. II. [Ah me, can nothing cure me, is my grief] Ah me, can nothing cure me, is my grief So much insanable, that no relief Can flow from Gilead? doe my sins obstruct Those tydes of grace which usually conduct Refreshments to me? Oh most dismall fate! He feels a plague too soon, that grieves too late. III. [Cimmerian mists, alas! and what are they?] Cimmerian mists, alas! and what are they? (Compar'd to me) lesse than a glorious day. The sense of my own blindnesse makes me know The blindnesse of my senses. Can a woe Be more exub'rous? Here's a griefe refin'd, A seeing Body, and a Soule that's blind. IV. [The sight-deprived wretch, whose darkned fate] The sight-deprived wretch, whose darkned fate Makes day and night (as 'twere) incorporate, And knows no diff'rence, but still gropes about, And finds his Day within, his Night without: But I, sad I, being muffled up in sin, Find Day without, alas! but Night within. V. [Saddest of thoughts! Oh that I could espie] Saddest of thoughts! Oh that I could espie One gracious Sun-beame, that my willing eye, Might, like the dawning of the Infant-day, Grow by degrees, and at the last display Some glorious rayes to my undarkned heart, I'de hug that light, and never let it part. VI. [But I, unhappy I, whose former dayes] But I, unhappy I, whose former dayes Consum'd in ill, have quite expell'd the rayes Of future happinesse; and now I see All evill is epitomiz'd in me. Too late I grieve, for what I feele too soone; The Sun lets fall his fiercest rayes at noone. VII. [Though foggy vapours oftentimes ascend] Though foggy vapours oftentimes ascend, Being exhaled by a Solar friend, From Earths chill breast, and for a season shroud Themselves within an entertaining cloud: Yet at the last, (unwilling to remaine) Discloud themselves, and fall to Earth againe. VIII. [But ah! my sin-exhaling soule is fill'd] But ah! my sin-exhaling soule is fill'd With noysome fogs that cannot be distill'd; They keep a forc'd possession, and encrease Within me, nay, and riot out my peace. Needs must the Empire of a troubled brain Feel store of torments where such Neroes raign. IX. [Corporeall griefs, comparatively, merit] Corporeall griefs, comparatively, merit The name of Pleasures to a troubled spirit: Martyrs have taught, that temporary pains (If well improv'd) swell into future gaines. Griefe's banisht quite from him that dyes forgiven; A Storme on earth portends a Calme in heaven. X. [As woe and trouble commonly await] As woe and trouble commonly await Upon the frailty of a humane state; So Grace and Mercy evermore are found Attending, where Divinity sits crown'd. Ah! would it not be undiscreetly done, To sit in darknesse to avoid the Sun? XI. [If Heaven should please to banish from our sight] If Heaven should please to banish from our sight His glorious lamp, whose most diffusive light Gives life to nature, all things would retire Into a Chaos, and the world expire. The Soul's a World-Divine, and Christ's the Sun, Who shining not, the world is chang'd, not done. XII. [We may observe, when happinesse concludes] We may observe, when happinesse concludes, How soone the sad and fatall interludes Of Misery appeare: For Griefe and Joy Are initiators. When our sins destroy The happinesse we had, Ah then appeares Mischief attended with an hoast of fears. XIII. [Adam (unhappy man!) with what a grace] Adam (unhappy man!) with what a grace Could he present himselfe before the face Of his well-pleas'd Creator, till the heat Of his owne lust compell'd him to retreat From Gods commands. Ah then, his new-bred fear Made him afraid to see, as well as heare. XIV. [Let but the apples of the tender eye] Let but the apples of the tender eye Receive a sudden touch, and by and by The sympathizing part will quickly be Frighted (as 'twere) into a mutiny. So when the Sin-toucht soule begins to smart, The sentiate faculties must beare a part. XV. [Courage in Sin, is but a Sin enlarg'd] Courage in Sin, is but a Sin enlarg'd; Which like a deep-mouth'd Cannon over charg'd Recoyles or breaks. Had Peter found no vent For his denying-sins, his soule had rent It selfe in pieces. Blest is he and wise, That can discharge his sorrow at his eyes. XVI. [Sins that doe float in teares, are often drown'd] Sins that doe float in teares, are often drown'd In their own floods; When reall sighs abound, They raise a tempest, and our sins are tost Against the rocks of Mercy, till they'r lost. When sins beleaguer us with hostile feares, There's no Artillery like Davids teares. XVII. [Curst (like the Fig-tree) is that barren eye] Curst (like the Fig-tree) is that barren eye That in a flood of sins is alwayes dry. Teares are the choicest Jewels which are set Like Orient Pearls in Heavens's rich Cabinet. When Faith implores, th'Almighty One that lent A vent for Tears, will send us teares to vent. XVIII. [Faith is the Souls best Orator; 'tis knowne] Faith is the Souls best Orator; 'tis knowne, There is no musick like a faithfull groane. A Whisp'ring faith will find a ready eare, When a loud-thundring faithlesse voice must steere From whence it came, no audience will be given, A soft tongue Faith on Earth, speaks loud in Heaven. XIX. [Faith feeds the hungry, and it safe-guards those] Faith feeds the hungry, and it safe-guards those, That feare the danger of incensed Foes. Tis Heavens proof-Armor, he that wears this shield, May safely meet Goliah in the Field. 'Tis heavenly mirth to heare a David sing; 'Twas Faith that kill'd Goliah, not a sling. XX. [The pretious balsome of a sound beliefe] The pretious balsome of a sound beliefe, Expels the poyson of a raging griefe. The Womans bloody issue could not be Cur'd, but by Faiths Divine Chirurgery. When grief assailes, the Patient must be sure. T'apply warm prayers, and Faith will end the cure. XXI. [Reason and Faith are combatants, the One] Reason and Faith are combatants, the One Demands a (why) the Other will be known Without a reason, for the powerfull hand Of Faith can fight, where reason cannot stand. He that believes whats possible, can straine His Faith no higher than a humane braine. XXII. [Faith is the mindes establisher, should we] Faith is the mindes establisher, should we Believe but what we understand, and see, We should prove Infidels: had Abraham try'd His Faith by humane sence, his Faith had dy'd. But barren Sarah, when her time was run, Blest aged Abraham with a smiling Son. XXIII. [When our estranged ashes, shall lye hid] When our estranged ashes, shall lye hid In their corruptions, reason will forbid Their re-uniting, but a faithfull eye Sees them inclining to their unity. If we observe, we shall be sure to finde That Faith sees best, when humane reason's blinde. XXIV. [A well-deserving eye, shall alwayes finde] A well-deserving eye, shall alwayes finde Faith and Theology, as close combin'd As Marth' and Mary were; who strive to smother The one, must needs extirpate the other. Accurst be they that separate such friends: Destroy the consort, and the musick ends. XXV. [Th'inflamed Lamp shines in a darksome night] Th'inflamed Lamp shines in a darksome night, And fills each corner with a trembling light; But when extinguisht our benighted eye, Leaves every object in obscurity. So shining Faith (snuft out by sinne) expires And leaves us mufl'd in our darke desires. XXVI. [Faith's a Monoculist, and can descry] Faith's a Monoculist, and can descry The Sun of glory with a single eye. It comprehendeth all things, every place Where she aboads, is beautifi'd with grace, Hee's like a pregnant Land, that knows no dearth, But brings forth many off-springs at one birth. XXVII. [Faith can unnaturalize a Lion, and] Faith can unnaturalize a Lion, and Make him lye subject to a strict command, Or Daniel had not liv'd, his Lamb had power, To make the Lions tremble, not devoure: Be pleas'd Oh Lord, to look upon our Sion, And send this Lamb to chase away our Lion. XXVIII. [When once despised Faith is laid aside] When once despised Faith is laid aside, Needs must the Fabrick of Religion slide. An unpropt-house, with danger is enjoy'd, And Pallaces prove rubbish when destroy'd. Oh how unblest is that declining Nation, Where Faith's quite lost, Religion's out of fashion. XXIX. [Faith and Religion like the Turtle-dove] Faith and Religion like the Turtle-dove, Having lost her first, admits no second love, The troubled Ocean is not eas'ly still'd, 'Tis far more easie to destroy than build. When Faction thrives, Religion starves at nurse, Who sins with Ægypt, must have Ægypts curse. XXX. [Sure sad Religion, cannot chuse but groane] Sure sad Religion, cannot chuse but groane Under deformity, when every one Shall dresse her at his pleasure: is it good To cancel that, which Martyrs seal'd with blood? Sure no it is not, blessings are despis'd, When pure Religion's so much Proteuniz'd. XXXI. [I'd rather want a blessing, than abuse] I'd rather want a blessing, than abuse The blessing that I have, th'apostate Jewes Can evidence this truth, for whilst they stood To save the evill, they destroy'd the good. Did it not adde to Pilates sin, who cry'd, I finde no fault, and yet our Saviour dy'd? XXXII. [Had Judas knowne the blessings he possest] Had Judas knowne the blessings he possest, In being private to our Saviours breast, [illeg.]e then his most inordinate desires, Had found no fuell to maintaine his fires. Best things in their corruption prove the worst, Truth speaks aloud, for Judas was accurst. XXXIII. [Alas how fondly did our thoughts despise] Alas how fondly did our thoughts despise These sacred joyes, which now we chiefly prize Because we want them, and we sadly prove The want of blessings tutors us to love The blessings that we had, if I transgresse, Let David witnesse what my thoughts expresse. XXXIV. [Th'unfathom'd gulfe of mans unsatiate minde] Th'unfathom'd gulfe of mans unsatiate minde Proves most outragious, when 'tis most confin'd. I could perswade my selfe, If 'twere a sinne Not to be sinfull, Man would soon begin To practice goodnesse, for the flesh would be Oppugnant to the spirits faculty. XXXV. [The raging fire, the more it is deprest] The raging fire, the more it is deprest The more it burnes, our Parent Eve transgrest Because she was forbid, although she knew What unavoided danger would accrew. Yet her unsatisfi'd desires were such, She could not chuse but taste as well as touch. XXXVI. [Factions the worst of Evills, 'tis a sinne] Factions the worst of Evills, 'tis a sinne Beyond addition; when we once begin To fall to Heresie, we know not how Nor what to act, alas we can allow A firme respect to nothing, for to day, We hug, what we to morrow cast away. XXXVII. [If we observe, it may be quickly seen] If we observe, it may be quickly seen How great a disproportion is between The Schools of God, and Nature, we conceive In Natures Schooles, before we can believe; But in the Schools of God we must aspire, First to believe, conceive, and then admire, XXXVIII. [Affliction is the Christians badge, who knowes] Affliction is the Christians badge, who knowes Earths greatest pleasure, finde her greatest woes, Alas what are th'injoyments of this life, But fleeting shadowes which denote a strife? If Davids troubles sojourne in my breast, Lord give me Davids heart, and I am blest. XXXIX. [He that indures Affliction, must abide] He that indures Affliction, must abide The harsh directions of his knowing guide: For they that travell in this world must take Affliction by the hand, or else they'l make A fruitlesse journey. He's a senslesse slave, That dances with Earth's musick te his grave. XL. [Affliction is sins Nursery, and they] Affliction is sins Nursery, and they That kill the Brat, must take the Nurse away; If not, they must expect what's much more worse, For sin is known to be the Devills nurse. Then may they cry with lamentable breath, No wages will content the Nurse, but death. XLI. [Wouldst thou prevent affliction? then draw near] Wouldst thou prevent affliction? then draw near, I'le tell thee how, when sin begins t'appeare: Drown it in teares, teares of a heavenly race, He that includes a sin, excludes a Grace. Sin often growes too aged for reliefe: There is no danger like a non-ag'd griefe. XLII. [The wise man grieves not, that he undergoes] The wise man grieves not, that he undergoes Affliction, but because he fully knowes So many sins deserv'd as many more, Ten times doubl'd, than he did before. Patience in things adverse, like Stars, shine bright, And most transparent in the darkest night. XLIII. [[illeg.]s good to be afflicted, or else he] [illeg.]s good to be afflicted, or else he That spoke it, took delight in Misery. [illeg.]Davids sins infect thee, let thy heart [illeg.]bath'd in Davids tears, and then thou art Endeared unto Heaven: for he that lent Much time to sinne, must borrow to repent. XLIIII. [Repentance leads to Heav'n, if we expect] Repentance leads to Heav'n, if we expect Future blessing, we must not neglect His present businesse, which if we delay, He'l want to morrow, what we lost to day: But let's consider e're our time be spent, How soon we sin, and yet how late repent. XLV. [He that delayes repentance, makes great haste] He that delayes repentance, makes great haste To his owne ruine, and commits a waste Upon his Soul, for every houre we spend And not repent, we wilfully befriend Our adversary, Hell, whose Ginnes being set, He lyes and watches, when to draw the net. XLVI. [The net being drawn, well may we run about] The net being drawn, well may we run about, And make our selves more fast, attempting out. Then our betrayed Soule may sadly say Had we repented, when 'twas said, to day, This net had not insnar'd us, nor we cry, We that did ever sinne, must ever dye. Gods Love, and Mans Unworthinesse. [[THE FIRST BOOK.]] God! how that word hath thunder-clapt my Soul Into a ravishment; I must condole My forward weakness; Ah, where shall I find Sufficient Metaphors t'express my mind? Thou heart-amusing word, how hast thou fil'd My Soul with Halelujahs, and distil'd Wonders into me! Oh, that I could break My heart in pieces, and divinely speak My mind in Raptures, that the frantique Earth May bath it selfe in these sweet streams of mirth, Then rouze my Soul, and practise how to turn Thy wonders into language; do not burn Thy sacred fuel in a place where none Can have the benefit but thee alone. Hoist up thy Sails, and let thy speedy motion Hurry thee hence into the boundless Ocean: Observe thy compass, keep a constant pace, And Heav'n will steer thee to the Port of Grace. 'Tis strange to think, how the Almighty can (That is so pure) love such a thing as Man, Whose primitive corruption makes him worse Then nothing, whose Rebellion claims a curse, More then affection: How can Heav'n endure A thing that can be nothing but impure? Man (like a word that's voyd of reason) sounds In every ear, his very name expounds A misery; at best, he needs must be But vain; And how can Heav'n love vanitie? Man (like a shadow) flies before the Sun Of his afflictions, and is still undone By his own doing, he's his own pursuer; And how can Heav'n love such a self-undoer? Man (like a naked worm) is often found Digging himself into the loathsome ground Of ruine, he's a Traytor to his Bliss; And how can Heav'n love such a worm as this? Man (like a flash of lightning) courts the world With lavish flames, and by and by is hurl'd Into that Nothing, whence it first he came; Then how can God love such a short-liv'd flame? Man (like a Reed) is evermore inclind To shake, and totter with each blast of wind; He's alwayes running to the ground with speed: And how can Heav'n love such an earthly Reed? Man (like the dust) is always blown, and tost From place to place, and flies, till it has lost Its Center; never resting in one place: Then how can Heav'n love that which flies in's face? Man (like a Fly) still buzzes up and down From cup to cup, and sips on, till he drown Himself in pleasure; fears no stander by: And how can Heav'n love such a drunken Fly? Man (like a Rain-bow) oftentimes appears Clothed in colours, but can claim no years, No days, nay hardly hours, but must decay; And how can heav'n love that which loves no stay? Man (like a bubble) floats upon the waves Of his desires, whilst every blast enslaves His brittle substance, fill'd with windy troubles; And how can heav'n love such unc?stant bubbles? Man (like the froth) spew'd from the Oceans brest, Is tyded up and down, but knows no rest, Nor perpetuity; and can betroth It self to nothing: Heav'n loves no such froth. Man (like the wind) is every moment flying To every place, and hates to be complying Or resting any where: how can it be? That Heav'n can love so much inconstancie? Man (like a swallow) loves the fragrant Spring Of Earths delights, but with a spreading wing Flies from the Winters more congealed brest; And how can Heav'n love such a Summer guest? Man (like a smoak) presumptuously aspires Into the air, and by and by retires Himself to nothing, nothing's his conclusion; And how can Heav'n love such a base confusion? Man (like a fire) whose green and scragged fuel Denies to burn, until it fight a duel With the incount'ring Bellows, which at last Obtains the conquest, then it burns as fast, And seems as 'twere, ambitious to expire; Then how can Heav'n love such a raging fire? Man (like an arrow) being once let go Out from the Archers well commanded bow, Affronts the Clouds; at last, having spent the store Of his smal strength, fals down, and seemst' adore Th'inferior Earth, which, with a welcome, hides His down-cast head within her wounded sides, Where he remains, and scorns to be withstood: Man can be any thing, but what is good. And cannot Man be good? strange kind of tone! What? has he wept himselfe into a stone, Like Niobie? no sure; I fear his eyes Were never loaded with such large supplies: Ah, could he weep a flood, Heav'n that prepares His eares to hear, would bottle up his tears In his remembrance; every drop should shine Like Pearls absconded in a golden Myne: His sins command a deluge; could his head Be turn'd into a fountaine, could he shed An Ocean at a drop, it could not cover His sins (which are mountainous) from the Lover Of real drops for he would soon discry Those sand excelling crimes, where ere they lie: Yet would his Soul so much compassionate The flowing sorrows of his wat'ry state, That with a calming hand he would remove His rocky sins, and hide them with his Love; He would have pity, and with speed consent T'express his love, when all our tears are spent. Should Heav'n, who justly may, for every sin Drop down a plague, and make it live within Mans guilty Soul, the world would quickly be Transform'd, and chang'd into a leprosie. Let none dispair, for Heav'ns known mercies can Out-infinite the greatest sins of man. Oh love beyond degree! Shall Heav'n indulge Himselfe to Man? and shall not Man divulge A gratefulness to him, whose hand prepares To wipe away his sin-polluted cares? Ungrateful Miscreant, how canst thou view Thy former miseries, and not renew Thy thanks to him, whose power set thee free, And brought thee back from thy captivity? Hast thou abandon'd Love? Wilt thou imprint Thy Soul with baseness? Ah, what obvious flint Hath turn'd Affections edg? What, art thou bent To shoot at him, that labours to prevent The arrows of thy ruine, which will fly Into thy brest, except he puts them by? Hast thou transform'd thy heart into a rock That will not move? Shall mercy call and knock, And thou not hear? What? hast thou arm'd thy heart With sensless marble, that no flaming dart Of love can enter? Hast thou vow'd to stand In opposition? Cannot Gods Command Force thee to bow? Art thou resolv'd to sport With thy destruction, and not yeild the Fort? Oh yeild be times; do not resolve to be Too much a slave to Infidelitie: For know (frail wretch) thy str?gth consists in clay; When Mercy's lost, then Judgment finds the way. Rally thy thoughts together, and throw down Thy brazen walls, thy yeilding yeilds a Crown: For 'tis in vain to oppose an arm that can Out-grasp the measure of so small a span, Alas, Alas! it may be quickly seen What a large disproportion is between Thy God, and thee: Consider, he is all, And thou art nothing; what can be more small? Or what more great? for he is infinite, And thou art finite: He is full of light, And thou of darkness; He is fill'd with love, And thou art stuff'd with baseness; He's a Dove, And thou a Worm: Thus, thus thou mayst discry His firmness, and thine own infirmity. Then be not obstinate, but strike the sails Of thy desires to him that never fails; And know, 'tis easie in an inch of time To take a worm ingarrison'd with slime; For such a thing thou art, and all thy power Must yeild to Heav'ns assaults; thy April showre Has no continuance: therefore do not strive Against a God, whose Wisdom can contrive What pleases him: Alas! thy state is grounded Upon contingencies, thou art compounded Of nothing but uncertainties; thy arm Assumes no power, except it be to harm Thy wilful self: Then why wilt thou contend With him that importunes to be thy friend? Thy friend, (soul-saving word) what higher bliss Can crown a heart, then such a Friend as this? Oh life of Ravishment! how can it be A God, a worm, and yet a sympathie? Strange condescention! was the like e're known, Or spoke by any mouth, except his own? His balmy breath declares, that he will save And succor those that faithfully do crave His blest assistance: Hark, and hear him say, Ye that are heavy loaded, come away, Oh come to me, I am content to bear Your burthens, and extenuate your care. What higher note of love was ever strain'd To any ear? Oh how hath man obtain'd So great a friendship! 'Tis a happy lot, Nay, and a wonder not to be forgot. And yet it is not strange, that he should prove So true a Lover, that's compos'd of Love, And can do nothing else: If he correct, 'Tis for thy crimes; he only has th'effect Of anger: for his grieved Spirit moans To punish sinners, and to hear their groans. His Soul takes no delight to crush to death The offending pris'oners of th'inferior Earth: He is the rich Exchequor of all good, And is by nothing (except man) withstood. All things perform what they was made to do, But only man, that strives to prove untrue To his Creator: nothing can be found Within thy breast, but that which is unsound. How sad it is to hear th'Almighty say, I've nourish'd children, that are gone astray, And scorn to own me! Oh rebellious dust! That hate my paths, because my ways are just. The Ox will know his Owner, and the Ass His Masters crib; but Israel, alas, Will not acknowledg me, but have destroy'd Themselves, &amp; made their understandings voyd: Was not my fury then just cause to swell, Because they can do nothing but rebel? Nefandeous Creature, how canst thou endure Thy wretched self? Ah, why wilt thou procure Thine own destructions? Shall all creatures be Obedient to their owners, only thee? And wilt thou not acknowledg him that gave Large blessings to thee, and desires to save Thy soul from torments, if thou wouldst incline Thy will to his, whose thoughts are all divine? Forget obduracy, and learn the art Of loving him, that loves an upright heart: Go ruminate upon thy base estate, And be, unto thy self, compassionate. Yeild to thy Maker with a cheerful brow? First know what 'tis to love, and after, how. Love is the Laws fulfiller; he that will Love God aright, must practise how to fill His Soul with true affection; for the ways Of Heav'n are pav'd with Love: Immortal praise Attend his Courts; He that forgets to Love Forgets his God: They that desire to prove Heav'ns amatorious Guests, must first admire How such a spark as Man came to aspire To such a flame, and how he came to be, Not only Earths, but Heav'ns, Epitomie: Be serious then, and let thy thoughts reflect Upon Heav'ns goodness, and thy disrespect. God out of Nothing (except Love) compil'd This spacious World, as if some princely child Were to be born: His providential care Was (as it were) ambitious to prepare The quintessence of pleasures to invite Some stately Guest to banquet with delight. First he extracted from a darksom Cell A glorious Light, whose beauty pleas'd him well Then he prepar'd a Canopie, inlayd With glittring pearl, whose twinkling luster made Heav'nly shew; and afterwards his hand Pusht back the waters from the naked Land: Then he commanded, that the Earth, being come Out from the Oceans new delivered womb, Would be adorn'd with an imbroidered Gown, That so her new-warm'd bowels might abound With several fruits.— —Thus having playd his part Upon this Theatre, this life of art, [illeg.]sher'd in a thing, which pleas'd him best, (He made the Feast, and after made the Guest;) Call'd by the name of Man, a naked, small, And dusty, shiftless Creature; this was all, And all this nothing, but a lump of death, Until inspir'd by Heav'ns all-quickning breath. [illeg.]in, simple wretch; ah, how could'st thou behave Thy self before a Judg, so great, so grave? Hadst thou but seen thy self, thou would'st have cry'd Thy self to death, and with a blush, defy'd Thy base estate, to think that thou should'st be Natures most rude and base Anatomie. Wouldst thou expect that Heav'n would entertain Nothing so poor? so weak? so vile? so vain? Which, like a spark blown from a new-made fire Can only shew it self, and then expire, Was it for this the All-Creator made Such large Provision? Was't for this he layd Such rich Foundations? Was't for this his Power Deckt this well-pleasing odoriferous Bower? Was it for this (this little world) he form'd A world so great? Was it for this he warm'd The Earths chill bosom? Was't for this he spent His six days labour? Was't for this intent He made a Paradise? where Flora spread Her fragrant Off-spring, and made Earth a bed Of rare compounded Pleasures, where he plac'd This new-come Guest, whose very looks disgrac'd The face of beauty, to whose thriftless hand He gave that Government, with this Command Of all the trees that here thou dost behold, Thy lips being authoriz'd, thou mayst be bold To taste with freedom, only one, which I Conjure thee from, therefore restrain thine eye From lusting after it; if not, thy breath Shall glut it self in everlasting death: Forget not my Commands, but let thy brest Be always faithful, and thou shalt be blest. Thus the Recorder having spoke at large This well-deliv'red (although ill-kept) Charge He after said; It is not good that man should be alone Without a help, Ile therefore make him one. Oh sacred prudence! Here we may discern A sweet Conjunction; here our Souls may learn Wisdom and Love, both which, if not enjoy'd, Pleasures prove vanities, and blessings voyd. Heav'n, whose unidle art-ful hand had set Man, as Jewell, in his Cabinet, Thought it unfit, that those delights which he Had made by his most powerfull Love, should be Monopoliz'd by one, he therefore laid Adam asleep, and having done, he made Out of a crooked rib (strange kind of art) A woman, fair, compleat, in every part; Nay, and a helper too: for in conclusion She helpt poore Adam to his own confusion. Oh most detested deed! Unconstant wife, To prove a Traytor to thy husbands life As soon as made: Fond wretch, could nothing suit With thy nice pallate, but forbidden fruit? Oh, could thy longing lie no longer hid? What? did'st thou long, because thou wert forbid? Was there no tree that could content thy eye, But only that which was forbidden? Fie, Oh shame to think thou shouldst so quickly waste Thine hours of pleasure for a minutes taste: Couldst thou not like, or fall in love with any But that? Heav'n had but one, &amp; thou hadst many Wherewith to please thine appetite; and yet Wouldst thou prove so ambitious, as to sit Upon the highest twigg? Ah, could th'advice Of Satan tempt thee to this avarice With so much ease, and make thee rashly do So foul a deed, and tempt thy Adam too? Preposterous wretch, how hast thou spread a cloud Over thy head? What? didst thou think to shroud Thy self from vengeance? Having eat thy death Couldst thou expect to live? Oh no, thy breath Offended Heav'n: but ah, hadst thou but thought (Before thy heart had entertain'd a fault So great as this) what 'twas to dye, thy mind Had made thee more abstemious, and confin'd Thy base inordinate desires; thy meat Had prov'd delightful, and thy comforts great But now, unhappy now, thy crimes have made Thy Soul Deaths debtor, and thou art betray'd By thine own self; therefore prepare to meet Thy wrathful Judg: 'tis said, stoln goods are sweet But thine prov'd sour, the fruits w?? thou hast stole Sugar'd thy mouth, but worm woodiz'd thy soul When thou hadst eaten, Ah! why didst thou not Tremble to death, to think thou hadst forgot Thy Gods Commands, &amp; that his Judgments must Follow thy soul, and blow thee into dust? Thus Eve, thus Adam, having vilipended Their Gods Commands, their happines soon ended; Their joys were turn'd to mourning, &amp; their light Was turn'd to darkness, and their day to night: Both being too much conscious, fled with speed To hide themselves from God, but not the deed. Even as some poor distressed wretch desires To hide himself from the enraged fires Of his incensed Foe, runs up and down To shun the rage of a condemned frown; At last observing his enquiring Foe Approach the place, lies still, and dares not blow, For fear the wordless Eccho of his breath Should soon betray him to a sudden death: Being at last discry'd, his throbbing heart Gives an Alarum to each trembling part; Fear, like an Earthquake, then begins to shake His loos'ned joynts, he knows not how to make A ready answer to his foes demands; [illeg.], as a sad convicted man, he stands Abjected to his will, that can dispence With nothing, but with death, to calm th'offence. Even so guilt-loaded Adam having done A deed so foul, prepares himself to run To some close shelter, where he might immure His naked body, and repose secure: But ah, in vain, in vain he strove to hide Himselfe from God, that need implore no guide To teach him where his sad offender lay; He needs must find, when sin hath chalk'd th'way But when Heav'ns shril-enquiring voyce surrounded The ears of Adam, Adam was confounded With deep distress, his heart began to call His quivering Senses to a Funerall: Fear, like a powerfull fire, began to thaw His frozen thoughts, and keep his Soul in awe He breath'd in a Dilemma, and could find No Sanctuary for a perjur'd mind: At last the language of th'eternal God Storm'd his sin-armed Soul, and like a Rod Whipt him from his security, and cry'd, Adam, where art thou? Adam thus reply'd, I heard thee walking in the pleasing shade Of the cool ev'ning, and I was afraid, And hid my self, because I must confess, I blusht to see my shameful nakedness. GOD. Tell me, thou trembling wretch, how dost thou know That thou art naked? say, who told thee so? What? has thy lips usurp'd the fruit which I Conjur'd thee not to touch? if so, reply. Adam. The woman which thou gav'st me, gave to me, And I did eat of the forbidden tree. GOD. Unconstant woman! Ah, why hast thou run Beyond thy bounds? what's this that thou hast done? Woman. The Serpents flowing language swel'd too great For my low banks: he tempted, and I eat. Gods Curse against the Serpent. Because thou hast thus subtilty deluded The lustful woman, thou shalt be excluded From future good; more shall thy curses yield Then all the beasts and cattle in the field: Thy belly shall (because thou hast done this) Give to the earth a life-remaining kiss; Thou shalt not taste of any thing that's good, Dust shall supply the place of wholesome food. Curst be thy ways, thou shalt no more be seen By me: I will put enmity between Thy seed and hers; hereafter thou shalt feel A bruised head, and she a bruised heel. Gods Curse against the woman. And as for thee, oh Woman, I'le enlarge Thy grief and thy conception; I'le discharge Thy joys, and load thee with a weighty grief; Thy pains in child-bed shall find no relief: Thou shalt desire thy husband, and his hand Shall over-rule thee with a strict command. Adams Curse. Rebellious Adam, unto thee I'le give A life as bad as death, for thou shalt live To see thy sorrows more and more abound, And for thy sake I'le curse the loathed ground; For thou hast hark'ned to the conquering voyce Of thy frail wife, and made my fruit thy choyce And sepulchred my words within the grave Of thy false heart; begon, thou selfe-made slave The thorny ground shall give a large increase To thy laborious hand; the name of Peace Shall prove a stranger to thy ears, and thou Shalt eat thy bread with a sweat-dropping brow I'le murther all thy joys; thy brest shall burn With flaming care, untill thy corps return To the bowels of th'inclusive earth, From whence thou hadst thy substance, and thy birth: But base thou art, and therefore thou shalt be Food for gnawing worms, and not for me: As thou art dust, to dust thou shalt retire; Hereafter let not dust presume't aspire. Change alteration! Oh pernicious Fate! So quickly bred in such an infant-state! He that but even now enioy'd a life Balanc'd with pleasures, now is fill'd with strife: He whose majestick Soul was lately crown'd With blest content, is now ingulf'd, and drown'd In Sorrows Ocean; He, which was before Touch'd with happiness, is now as poor As poverty can make him; He, which had The countenance of Heav'n to make him glad, Is now eclipst; he knows not where to run, [illeg.] having interpos'd between the Sun And his dark Soul, the Center of whose rest Now remov'd, and he survives unblest: [illeg.] which but even now had leave to dwell [illeg.]d revel in Heav'ns eye, desires a Cell [illeg.] entertaine him; he, which liv'd in Peace, Now thrown down, and forfeited his lease: [illeg.]at was his Crime, great was his sudden Fall, [illeg.]at was his Tenement, his rent but small: Poor Adam's taken by his own decoys; Sin is the Sequestrator of all joys. Sad Pilgrim of the world, where wilt thou find (In the unpathed earth) a place so kind To entertain thee? Ah, where wilt thou keep (Thus tumbled from a Precipice so steep) Thy sad unpeopl'd randezvouz? Oh where Wilt thou procure a hand that will unsnare Th'intangled Soul? Alas thy wearied life Hath two most sad companions; first a Wife, Then a bad Conscience; what two greater crosse Can hang upon a brest, whose cares, whose losse Are grown so infinit, that no relief, But what distils from Heav'n, can ease their grief Thou wert the first of men that entertain'd So grand a sorrow, thou the first that stain'd So pure a colour, thou the first that dwelt In Edens garden, thou the first that felt The scourge of fury; hadst not thou transgrest, Vengeance had found no hand, nor grief a breast Ah, hadst not thou offended, sin had found No habitation, nor thy Soul a wound: Had not thy hand so wilfully unlock'd The door of Death, Destruction had not knock'd At thine impenetrable gates, or ventur'd T'approach so near, but being open'd, enter'd Bold Customer of fate, that sought about To come within, and turn poor Adam out; Thy str?gth outstrengthd his str?gth, &amp; made him weak A vessel crack'd, how can it chuse but leak? [illeg.]n prov'd Deaths father, &amp; mans heart the womb That brought it forth; this death shall find a tomb When the Determiner of time hath hurl'd [illeg.] finis to the volume of the world; [illeg.] then, man (mortaliz'd by sin) must be [illeg.] subject unto Deaths Soveraigntie. Poor man, in what a wilderness of sorrow Dost thou now ramble in; where wilt thou borrow A minutes rest; On what inclining ear Wilt thou expend thy groans? what canst thou hear [illeg.]t dialects of misery to vex Thy bankrupt thoughts? The fatal disrespects Of Heav'n will blow and toss thee up and down From place to place, his still-renewed frown Will follow thee; therefore provide t'endure The hot pursutes of such a fierce pursuer: Canst thou expect that this thy grand abuse Which runs beyond the limits of excuse) Can be forgotten; Dost thou think t'out-live Thy long-liv'd crimes, or hope for power to give [illeg.]e satisfaction to thy God, whose rage Thy heart cannot endure, much less asswage? Most lachrymable state! What canst thou do, Oh man that may ingratiate or renew Thy former love? Alas, thy base condition Makes thee incapable of a Petition. Prepare thy selfe, see if thou canst invade His Soul with pray'rs, see if thou canst perswade His Heart to yeeld unto thy sad request, And re-inthorne thee with thy former rest; Dissect thy Soul with groans, anatomize Thy heart with sighs, and let thy winged cries Fly through the angles of his sacred ear And breed a harmony within the sphere Of his blest Soul; be circumspect, and lay The best foundation; hear what Heav'n will say. Adams Petition to God. Incensed Father of eternal light, Permit a darkened Soul t'approach the sight Of thine incomparable eye; unmask Thy anger-clouded Soul, and let me ask Forgiveness for those loading Crimes which press My stagg'ring Soul, I know not whom t'address My apostate self unto, but only thee, Whom I offended; Please to pity me: I have no pleasing Sacrifice t'attone Thy wrathful Brest, except a hearty groan That's quadrupl'd with grief; Oh deign to look Upon the lines of my all-blotted book: Although I'm full of most detested spots, Yet Lord, I know that thou canst read my blots; Oh read them then, and let thy mercies run With thy progressive eye; I am undone, If not forgiven; Lord I thee implore To shew some mercy to me, thou hast store, Discipher all my sins, and let them not Bear record in thy rouls, but rest forgot; Revoke this Act of death, that I may sing Th'admired mercies of so blest a King. Oh lift me up, that now am thrown below; Make not my Soul the Custom-house of woe. Oh hear these bitter groans that I have spent, And send some comfort from thy Parliament. Gods Reply. Thou skelleton of baseness, hie thee hence, Disturb me not; return, I say, from whence Thou cam'st at first; thou shalt as soon remove A mountain, as my mind: I cannot love, No nor I will not, nothing shall intreat My resolutions, for my fury's great. Begone, proud Rebel, do not think thy prayers, Thy vows, thy groans, thy sighs, thy sobs, thy tears Shall make my brest their receptacle; No: How can I be a friend to such a foe? Surcease thy importunities, let fall Thy high desires, I will not hear thee call, Thy sins have barr'd my ears; I'le not be won With thy base airy words, for thou hast spun The thread of thy destruction, therefore wear What thou hast labour'd for, and so forbear T'intrench upon my patience; 'tis in vain To seek for that which thou shalt not obtain. And is it thus, that Heav'n will not regard My cries? Ah me! and must my groans be heard With disrespect by him, whose tongue affords Nothing but grief, involv'd with bitter words? Alas, alas! what greater woe can crowd Into a brest then to be disavow'd By Gods high Voyce, whose most enraged breath Darts forth the arrows of eternal death? What shall I doe? Oh, whither shall I run To hide my selfe, until the glorious Sun Of his affections usher in the day Of welcom Joy? Oh, whither shall I stray? If I am silent, then my silence turns My thoughts to fire; If speak my speech returns Trebbl'd with wo, into the brazen Tower Of my sad heart, my language has no power To work upon his ears, my words (like balls [illeg.]nded, and thrown against th'obdurate walls Unyielding brest) bounds back againe, and breaks [illeg.]to my heart, and every sorrow speaks [illeg.] volume at a word; yet, yet must I Return unheard; 'tis misery to dye, And pain to live; thus in despair I draw The loathsom air: Destruction knows no Law. Grief rains a flood of doubt into my Soul; [illeg.] me! I can do nothing but condole: [illeg.]m despis'd; and if I bend the force Of my desires to him, he will divorce All thoughts of pity, and with rage re-double Th'unsum'd up sums of my infringing trouble. [illeg.] sail into the Straits, both wind and tyde Prevail against me, and I have no guide To Pilot me unto the long'd-for Port Of pleasing happiness; I am a sport To threating Ruine, whose presumptuous waves Out-dares my Soul, whilst every blast enslaves My reeling Pinnace: If I strive to go Towards Scylla, Scylla will contemn my wo. [illeg.]as in vain I can expect relief, Scylla will bark at my unbridled grief; [illeg.]r if my head-long vessel chance to hit Against Charybdis; I am torn and split Into ten thousand pieces; Oh hard hap! Thus am I tossed in Destructions lap. Where shall I find a heart that will advise My friendless Soul, and audiate my cries? I will not thus desist, I must implore, He that's lost once, sure can be lost no more. Adams Petition to God. Once more, thou Metropolitan of all The spacious world, I here presume to call Upon thy mercy; Oh let me inherit The pleasing fruits of thy re-pleased Spirit: I am thy fabrick. Oh some pity take, Preserve the building for the Builders sake. Clothe not thy brow with frowns, but let thine eye (That rests inshrin'd with glorious Majesty) Reflect upon my sorrows; Oh encline Thy willing ears to hear this grief of mine: Oh doe not say I shall as soon remove A mountain as thy heart, thou canst not love; Let not such harsh, imbitter'd language flow Out of a mouth so sweet; I know I know, Thou art as good as great; oh therefore bow Thy sacred ears to hear, oh hear me now: Bestow some scraps on me, that have deserv'd Nothing but stripes; for I have fondly swerv'd From thy commands, &amp; have committed treason Against thy Majesty: Great God of Reason, View my in-humbled Soul, see how it lies Before thy sight, a weeping Sacrifice. I know thou knowst I am a hainous sinner, Yet pity me, that am a young beginner In this rich art of begging: Do not slight My real prayers; I know thou tak'st delight In being merciful; Oh let me not Return unanswer'd, or my prayers forgot: Oh hear the sorrows of my bleeding state, Let my complaints make thee compassionate, And let the fervor of my language turn Thy thoughts to pity; quench these flames that burn My wasting Soul; speak peace to me, that find A civil war in my uncivil mind: Oh I have tasted of thy hot displeasure Too much, Ah shall thy vengeance know no measure? Say 'tis enough; though (Lord) I must confess I have deserved more, yet give me less. Thus with a melting heart I end my Suit, Ah me! how bitter is forbidden fruit! Gods Reply. Thou bold-fac'd Orator, how dar'st thou come Before me, or be otherwise then dumb? Tell me, how dar'st thou interrupt my brest? I hate to see thee, or hear thy Request. Audacious wretch, what, has my Judgmentt made Thy heart grow peremptory? Have I layd Too small a burthen on thee? if I have, I'le lay a greater, thou apostate slave: I will not note thee, nor I will not hear Thy words, which have usurp'd my deafned ear: Love thee, for what? be't known, sad wretch, I scorn To love a thing so base, so vile, forlorn; And if I cannot love, how can it be, That I can pity such a worm as thee? I'le neither love, nor pity, for my heart Is adamantine; thou shalt feel the smart Of my displeasure: Go, my Soul disdains To look upon thee; thou art fill'd with stains, And smel'st too much of fruit to find respect, Thou art the subject of my great neglect: Thou art a barren soil, nothing will grow Upon thy heart, except the seeds of woe. Tell me, from what conceit dost thou derive Thy working confidence, that thou dar'st drive Thy language to my ears, and be so bold T'approach my sight, and wilt not be controul'd? Art thou resolv'd to make (what dost thou mean) My ears thy stage, and every word a scean? Sum up thy small, thy weak deserts, and see What large respects thou hast deserv'd from me. I plac'd thee in a garden, not to eat The fruit forbidden, but to keep it neat: Had not the violation of my Laws Mov'd me to anger, thou hadst had no cause T'ave felt the burthen of my weighty stroke, Or live thus much subjected to the yoke Of thine own sins; most shameful is that loss That's crown'd with negligence, &amp; great the cross That's made with a self-hand; and they that clime Above their strengths impropriate a crime To their own Souls; Destruction is the end Of all rebellion: Ruine knows no friend. Suppose I should invest and intertain Your Soul with love, and call thee back again, The tree is still the same, the fruit as sweet, Thy appetite as great, and thou mayst meet A Serpent too, whose oratorious skill May soon entreat thee to enact his will: He has a voyce to tempt, and thou an ear Will re-assume the priviledg to hear: He has a hand to give, and thou another Freely to take: thus wouldst thou quickly smother Thy new delights; therefore I will not trust A heart that can be nothing but unjust. Thou great Mugul of baseness, cease to plead, Thy tongue's a canker, and thy words are lead; Thy sins have made thee not deserve the air Thou entertain'st; hadst thou imploy'd thy care To serve me, when I lov'd thee, thou hadst had My heart-delighting joys to make thee glad; But now expect no favour, for no art Of thine shall ever captivate my heart. Hie thee unto the shades of grief, bewail Thy sequestrated happiness, no bail Of thy procuring will I take to set Thy Soul at liberty; I will not let The vision of a comfort creep within Thy rambling thoughts, thou art a slave to sin: Hadst thou but lov'd or fear'd me at the first, Th'adst been as happy, as th'art now accurst: If now thou lov'st me, I shall quickly prove It is for fear alone, and not for love. Thy heart is steel'd with wickedness, thy faults Are sparks enlivened by thy flinty thoughts. Breathe out thy groans unto a sensless rock, And let thy sighs (like hammers) beat and knock Against her scragged sides, thou shalt as soon Have her consent, as mine, to grant thy boon: 'Tis therefore vain to multiply thy words, For ah, my brest, my hardened brest, affords Thy Soul no pity: and the more thy cry Attempts my ear, the less I will reply, Alas! thy guilt-o're-burth'ned words renew Fresh thoughts of rage, I cannot hear thee sue Without impatiency; for ah the longer Thou crav'st, thou mak'st my fury grow the stronger. Avoid my presence, for I will no more Give audience to thy voyce, then cease t'implore. Adams Lamentation. Undone, undone! what mountain now will hide My lothed body from the swelling tyde Of raging Vengeance? Whither shall I fly T'involve my Soul with true security? Stretch, stretch my lungs, and roar unto the deep [illeg.] entertain me: Oh that I might sleep Within her wavey bowels, till the blast Of Heav'ns all-shaking thundring Voyce were past. Oh that some rock would hear my sad request, And give me burial in her frigid brest! Oh that my grief extended voyce could cleave The soild Earth, and make her to receive My wretched limbs! Oh that some ranging beast Would prove so courteous to devovr, and feast Upon my corps! Oh that I could contrive A way to live, and yet not be alive! Ah, thus my sorrow-shaken fancy flies And envies at impossibilities. I fain would dye, but that I have no heart To kill my self, and yet I feel a smart Transcending death; I see I cannot shun The wrath of Heav'n: Ah, thus I am undone By my own doing, this it is to eat Forbidden fruit: Oh most pernicious meat! I was too rash, and rashly have I taken A deadly fall, and falling, am forsaken: I'm bruis'd to death, and yet I cannot dye; Ah, what can be so much unblest as I? I am inflamed, and I dayly drench My Soul with tears and yet I cannot quench My raging fires; the more I strive t'asswage And mitigate my pains, the more they rage. What shall I do, or whither shall I go, To hide me from this Labyrinth of Wo? I am compos'd of sorrow, and my veins, Instead of blood, are fill'd with griping pains. Curst be these eyes of mine, which have let in The lawless tyrant of imperious Sin: Curst be these lips of mine, which at the suit Of my fond wife receiv'd forbidden fruit: Curst be these ears, that entertain'd the charms Of that inchantress, which procur'd my harms Curst be these hands of mine, which took, and fed My greedy Soul, and struck my Conscience dead: And now my lips, my ears, my hands, my eyes, Must see, hear, taste, and feel, my miseries. Oh sad condition! Since there's no relief, I must be subject to perpetual grief. Here we will leave poor Adam in the state Of woe, and thus begin to ruminate. Are there not many in this toilsom age That meditate themselves into a rage, And wonder how a Serpent could express Himself, and reason with such readiness. Being by nature brute, nay and the worst Of living creatures, that he should at first Perswade and conquer, and instruct his will, How to determine both of good and ill? It would seem strange, if Reason were without Her wings, and could flie above this doubt: We may (and yet not stain the truth) declare It was the work of Satan to ensnare Frail Eve; although he was not nam'd at all By Moses in the Hist'ry of the Fall, It may not trouble us, for we must know, The bending Serpent was the Devils bow, By which he shot the arrows of his spite, Which did [Oh grief to speak it!] flie too right: And he that dares so high a Crime to act (Though by another) needs must own the fact: And this our tongues may never cease to tell, The Serpent was the Instrument of Hell, Tun'd to the Devils voice: thus we may see His fraud, his malice, and his subtiltie. First when he saw he could not over-turn The great Creator, he begun to burn With flames of envy, lab'ring to invade, And so disturb that order God had made In the Creation, and to change the features Of his own Image in the best of Creatures, That so he may by his too sooth delusion Make man run headlong to his own confusion: Thus having laid the platform of his work, He then begun to agitate, and lurk For opportunity, which was effected As soon, nay if not sooner, than expected; He gave the blow, and by that blow he found The weakest vessel had the weakest sound; But yet it strongly eccho'd to the voice Of his desires, and made him love his choice. Even as some bold-fac'd General, that dares To storm a well-man'd Town; at first prepares A potent Army, which he soon sets down Before the Walls of the alarum'd Town; He after views the ruine-threatning-Fort, Which speaks defiance, and begins to sport Their severall shots, and with a sad delight Ingage each other in a bloody fight: Then if the fierce Besiegers once perceive Themselves out-strength'd, they think it fit to leave So hot a work, and for a little space Desist, and fall upon a weaker place, Where finding smaller opposition, venture With greater courage, and at last they enter The yielding Town, and cruelly begin To take revenge of them that are within. Even so the grim-look'd, malice-armed Devil, The base-resolved Generall of Evill, Perceiving, that he could by no meanes take The sublime Fort of Heav'n, plots how to make A fresh attempt, upon a weaker part, And so prepares to storme the flexive heart Of unresisting Eve; that could not grapple With such a Foe, but yielded for an Apple To those most false Alarums which surrounded Her, much obedient, and soon confounded Her inward parts, and gave her Soul a wound, Which cannot be by time or art made sound, Except the grand Physitian please to slake His swelling fury, and some pity take. Thus are our conquer'd parents sadly left In a deplor'd condition, and bereft Of all their comforts; they which have enjoy'd The life of happinesse, are now destroy'd; And man (his wretched off-spring) must be made Sorrowes sad heir, and Peace must not be said T'inhabit in him. Adams actuall sin Made ours originall; for we begin, As soon as made, to entertain the guests Of sin, and lodge them in our infant-brests. Now may our weak and despicable eyes Behold in them, our ample miseries: Now we may glut the Air with this sad cry, The root being dead, the branches needs must dye For Adam's gone beyond all humane call: Rebellion never ends without a Fall. But stay my Muse, here let us rest a while; Our Journey's long, and 'tis not good to toil Too much at first, for Reason sayes 'tis best To pause a time, and take a little rest: Know then (kind Reader) that my Muse shall meet Thy serious eyes within another sheet. The end of the first Book. THE SECOND BOOK OF GODS LOVE, AND Mans Unworthiness. Are all hopes fled? and is there no relief? Must man still wander in the shades of grief? Will not the eye of Heav'n be pleas'd to shine Upon his Soul, but leave him in the brine Of his own sins? Is there no warbling voice Can charm his ears, and woo him to rejoice In being pitifull? Will nothing move The much incensed Soul of Heav'n to love? Man [Map of Misery] who can prevail In thy requests? Or who cut off th'entail Of thy distresse? 'Tis not a writ of Error Can satisfie, or guard thee from the terror Of thine own Conscience, which will alway stare Upon thy face, and load thee with dispair: 'Tis not a Habeas Corpus will remove The body of thy sin, none can disprove The Will of God, what he resolves to doe Must neither be withstood, nor div'd into: It lyes beyond thy power to perswade Thy God to pity, whom thy sins have made A wrathfull Judge; what he intends, must be Derived from himself, and not from thee; For thou hast nothing in thee worth the name Of good, because thy glory's turn'd to shame: Thou art corrupt and vile in every part, And who can know the evill of thy heart; Which like the Ocean, that no art nor eye Can search her bottome, or her banks discry: Therefore till heav'n shall please to change the state Of thy condition; Reason bids thee wait; For be assur'd, the promis'd seed will spread It selfe abroad, and bruise the Serpents head. Even as the Fountain, whose exuberous brest Is alwaies fluent, and admits no rest; But with a cheerfull willingnesse she sends Her crystal tokens to her smaller friends. Even so our God distilleth from above The healing streams of his refreshing love; For ah the lustre of his Sun-bright eye Is drown'd in tears, when our sad Souls prove dry! Oh admiration! that a God so just Should rain down floods upon a heap of dust! Oh Mercy! that so much incens'd a God Should send forth Mercy, and keep in his Rod! His Soul is fill'd with pity, and his eyes Begin to view th'unsatiate miseries Of Adams down-cast off-spring: Though his ear Seems unto us resolved not to hear Their bitter cries, nor note the sad Devotions Of their contristed hearts; yet by the Motions Of his blest Soul, he sends his Son and Heir Into this wretched world, that he might bear The Cross of our Transgressions, and expell The clouds of sin, and conquer Death and Hell: Thus by his death we liv'd, and by his grief Our new-calm'd Souls were furnisht with relief. Oh sudden change! That winde which did before Drive wretched man upon the threat'ning shore Of unavoiding ruine, fills the sails Of his desires with milde and prosperous gales; The Boreas of his sin does now surcease His full-mouth'd blasts, and Zephyrus speaks peace Unto his shipwrack'd Soul, and now he rides Upon the new-tam'd backs of pleasing Tydes. Oh that my tongue were able to rehearse The Love of God with an Angelike Verse! Oh that some heav'nly Deity would fill The black mouth'd concave of my wandring quill With pure celestial Ink, that I might write In heav'nly characters, and learn t'indite Jehovahs praises in a style as high As my desires, and make the lofty Skie Eccho with Hallelujahs, that the Earth May (like a Midwife) hug the joyful birth Of every word, and make each corner ring (With peals of Joy) the Glories of our King: Is man deliver'd from the painful womb Of his foul sin, and raised from the tomb Of everlasting death? and shall not we Applaud that hand which set such pris'ners free? What, shall we be afraid to crack and break The chains of silence, and attempt to speak The dialects of Angels? No: let's call Upon his name, that rais'd us from a Fall. Let's stretch our lungs, and with a warbling breath [illeg.]ng to the life, how we were rais'd from death: And when our tongues are wearied, let's express By heav'nly signs our real thankfulness. But stay, where runs my quill? what, have I lost My self in raptures? or else am I tost Into the air of pleasure by the winde Of true delight? If Passion proves so kinde, I am content, Oh may I alwaies rest Adorn'd and crown'd with a Heav'n-ravisht brest! O love ineffable! Must wretched Man, The spawn of baseness, and the unmeasur'd span Of everlasting infancy, be made Loves object? Must th'Almighty's love be said To dwell in Man, whose tongue cannot deliver The least of thanks unto so great a Giver? Will the Sun-gazing Eagle, that soars high, Descend t'assist the web-infolded Fly? Will he that hearkens with a willing ear To pleasing musick, turn away to hear Confounding discords? or will any woo A perjur'd enemy to come and go Unto his Courts? will any hand forbear To strike at him that labours to impair His worth, and contumeliously upbraid His upright deeds? Will he that is betray'd Affect the Traytor, and with patience sue For reconcilement, when as death is due? All this blest Heav'n will doe, that he might place Vain man within the Covenant of Grace. Consider man, how often hath this mirror Of pure affection woo'd thee from thine error? Thou unconsiderate dust, which every winde Can puff away, how canst thou prove unkinde To such a Lover, that delights to spin His bowels out, to nourish thee within His milky bosom? Shall his bounty crave Thy base acceptance? shall he be a slave To his own slaves? Ah, shall thy God implore, And beg of beggars to receive his store? Does he, whom Heav'n and Earth cannot contain, No nor the heav'n of heav'ns, stoop down to gain Thy dull respects? And ah, wilt thou not raise Thy stupid Soul an inch to give him praise? Thy fervent prayers he alwaies will admit, Then how canst thou remember to forget A God so mindfull? How canst thou forbear To numerate his love without a tear? How can thine eyes (when thou observ'st the Sun) Refuse to weep to see him daily run His painfull progress, and rejoice to greet The earth with lustre to direct thy feet, Thy sinfull feet, which every moment slide Into Rebellion, loaded with thy pride; How canst thou choose, when thou behold'st the ground Whereon thou tread'st, but voluntary drown'd Thy self in briny floods, to think what care Indulgent Heav'n hath taken to prepare For thee, before thou wert, and how his hand Hath for thy profit, fertiliz'd the Land? How can thy rocky heart refuse to vent A stream of blood, when thou behold'st th'extent Of the unbounded Ocean, how it hides Within the bosome of her swelling Tydes, Diversities of fish, which live to feed Thy gulf of gluttony at time of need? Uncloud thy thoughts (O Man) and thou shalt see He who ordained all these things for thee, Created thee for him, that thou may'st give The praise to him, that lends thee leave to live. Be serious Man, consider how thou hast Converted all these blessings into waste: Know that the great Edificer of things Furnish'd thy Soul with Reason, gave thee wings To fly above all mortals, and hath crown'd Thy head with heaps of honour, and hath bound Inferior creatures, prentice to thy will; And this he did, because thou should'st fulfill Thy Gods Commands; but thou that wert the best Hast made thy self more loathsome than the rest, And by thy most detested deviation Abus'd thy glory, of thy free Creation: Though the Majestick Eagles will despise To be assistants to th'intangled Flies; Yet Heav'n will from his lofty Throne descend, And with a speedy cheerfulnesse defend The sons of men, who daily are betray'd By those insiduous snares which Satan lay'd T'intrap their Souls: Alas, how voyd of care Is heedlesse man! How subject to a snare! But he, whose more than superficiall love Is alwayes active, lab'ring to improve Our hearts with thankfulnesse, denies to let Our Souls be taken in th'eternall net Of unconceived misery, and live In lasting death, not having power to give The least of drops unto our howling tongues, But suck the flames, untill our sulphurous lungs Crackle, and belch forth brimstone, till we tire Our Carbonado'd members in a fire That's inextinct; the more we strive to turn Our parched Souls, still more and more they burn. Resolve these things within thy serious mind; Oh Man! let Love instruct thee to be kind To him that's loving; doe not disrespect A God, whose Soul so dearly can affect: Pour out thy thoughts, and practice to relent, And let thy thoughts induce thee to repent: Grasp opportunity, Time's alwayes flying; God's alwayes living, and thou alwayes dying: Dye then, before thou dy'st, redeem the time, Because thy dayes are evill; learn to clime Jacobs erected ladder; thou shalt set Th'adst better clime a Ladder, than a Tree, As Judas did: Be wise, and doe not fan Thy Soul with air; remember what a span Thou art; remember whose inspired breath Made thee a Soul; forget not whose sad death Made thee alive; be mindfull that thou art Th'Epitomy of Heav'n; inure thy heart To love the best of loves, so shall thy brest Be fill'd with comfort, and thy Soul with rest: Prepare and know, the very fowls delight To prune their wings before they take their flight. Although terrestiall Kings will not permit A Traytor to his Courts, nor let him sit Before his presence, though they will not hear A Malefactors prayers; yet Heav'ns blest ear Is alwayes open, and his tongue invites Repentant sinners, for his eye delights To view them in his Courts when they appear; For muddy waters, may at last prove dear; 'Tis not unlike; ill scented dunghills may At last bear flowers; that which is foul to day, To morrow may prove fair; the thing that cost Millions of silver, may as well be lost, As things of smaller value; Heav'n can spy A mite, as well as mountains; for his eye Is lodg'd in every cranny of mans heart, And he knowes all, that searches every part. Where breathes that Mortall that can comprehend The wayes and thoughts of God, who knowes the end Of his beginning?— He that can break a rocky heart in twain, And re-unite it (if he please) again; He that can part the boiling waves, and stand Upon the Seas, as on the dryest Land; He whose celestiall power can make the graves To open, and command their slumb'ring slaves To rise; nay more, to stand; nay more, to walk; Nay more (if more then this may be) to talk: He that can make a Whale to entertain A Jonah, and to spue him out again; He whose Almighty power can unlock The flinty bowels, of a scragged Rock, And make her headlong-gushing streams abound To wash the bosom of the thirsty ground; He that can transmutate by power divine The poorest water into richest Wine; He that can curb rude Boreas, and asswage The lawless passion of the Oceans rage; He that can rain-down Manna to supply The craving stomacks of mortality; He that can, like an all-commanding God, Make Almonds flourish from a sapless rod; He that can make the Sun and Moon stand still, Or run according to his sacred Will; He that sav'd a Daniel from the paws Of Lyons, and can muzzle up their jaws; He that can make the greedy Ravens carry Food to his Servants like a Commissary; He that can, with an unresisted hand, Dash fire into Ice, and counter-mand The wanton flames, and charm them, that they dare But burn his servants cords, and not their hair; He that can cause ten thousand to be fed With two small fishes, and five loaves of bread; He that can clothe himself with fire, and name Himself, I AM, and make a bush to flame Without consuming; He that can convert A Rod into a Serpent, and not hurt; He that can make his visage shine so bright, That not a Moses can behold the light; He that can strike a hand with leprosie, And cure it in the twinkling of an eye; He that can in a moment cut and break Tongue-tying cords, and make the dumb to speak; He that can out of unregarded stones Raise unto Abraham many little ones; He that can heal the Cripple with a touch, And free him from the thraldom of his Crouch; He that can cure the deaf, and can expell A thousand Devils in despite of Hell; He that can perfect what he first begun, Expects that man should say, Thy will be done. Consider Man, and thou shalt finde it true, Heav'n can doe all, but what he will not doe: Think not, because thou art of low estate, That he will scorn to love, and love to hate: Remember Dives, whose unsumm'd up store Improv'd so much, untill he prov'd as poor As ever Job was: Job! unhappy I To speak it, he was rich in poverty; Heav'n made poor Job so rich, that Satans wealth Could purchase nothing from him, but his health, And that corporeal too; he could not boast His bargain, for 'twas Job that purchas'd most. Happy is he that can at last inherit Riches obtain'd by an impov'rish'd spirit: We'd better lick with Lazarus the crumbs, Then gripe with Dives for Soul-damning sums. Welth cannot bride the flames, yet scraps may feed The hungry wretch; he that has wealth, may need The crumbs of comfort: David did condole Th'abundant famine of his hungry Soul: Gods love's not mercenary, to be sold For brain-distracting, heart-confounding gold. Hast thou not heard (O man) the heav'nly cry Of him that says, Ye that are poor, come buy, Come buy of me; your pen'worth shall be such, That for a little you shall purchase much. Here's Love that's spun unto the smallest thred, Tho thou want'st mony, yet thou maist have bread: Do thou but ask, thou shalt not fail to have; For God's more free to give, then thou to crave: Fear not to ask of him, whose ready ear, Before thy tongue can ask, is apt to hear. Heav'n loves the language of a broken heart, And he will harken, and with joy impart His love unto thee, and his milk and wine, Without the price of mony shall be thine. Th'ingrated pris'ner, whose dull tongue is whet With sharp'ned hunger, will not fear to let His language fly to every eare that comes Within his audience; and he alwayes sums The totalls of his grief in hungry words, Whilst thousands passe along, but few affords The blessing of an Alms perhaps they'l grieve, And seem to pity, but will not relieve Yet will he not desist, but hourly cry, Bread, bread, for Heav'ns sake bread, or else I dye. Hard hearted Man, why wilt thou not relent To hear thy brother, almost hunger-spent, Craving thy succour? Where's thy love become? Because th'art deaf, ah! woldst thou have him dumb? Or dost thou think, because thy panch is fill'd, He cannot hunger? He that first distill'd Those mercies on thy head, expects that thou Shouldst feed thy brother with a cheerfull brow; Say not thou canst not give, thy treasure's light: But let thy heart record the widowes mite, So Heav'n will fill thy Cisterns to the brim, And feed thy Soul, because thou hast fed him. Should the Grandfather of true Charity Passe by the gates, and heare thee beg and cry, And not relieve thee; should he slight thy prayers, And scorn to take a survey of thy tears; Wouldst thou not grieve, and pine thy self to dust, And almost say thy God was much unjust, To turn away his ears from thy complaint, And disrespect thy pray'rs, and let thee faint For want of Food? Ah, whither wouldst thou fly To feed thy famish'd Soul, should Heav'n deny? But ah he cannot, for his melting Soul Is alwayes free, and willing to condole The sad conditions of distressed Man, Who only strives to doe, but what he can To contradict him; yet he'l heare our grief: In multitudes of mercies lies relief. When our impris'ned Souls peep through the grates Of this corrupting Earth, our God dilates Himself unto us, and he sends us meat From the rich store-house of his lofty Seat; He hears; and hearing pitties; pittying, sends; And sending, blesses; and with blessing ends. Even as the Sun, which every day surrounds The sublime Globe, and pries into the bounds Of this dark Center; lets his Beams reflect Upon a molehill with as much respect As on a Mountaine; for his glorious Beams Shine alwayes with equivalent extreams. Even so the great and powerfull three in one, That sits upon his all-inlight'ning Throne, Does not deny to let his mercy crown The poorest Peasant with as much renown As the most stateliest Emperor; though he Invests his body with more dignitie, Yet he's but earth, and must at last decay, For Prince and Peasant go the self-same way; Their earth must turn to earth, their Souls return To him that gave them, or for ever burn; There's no distinction, one infused breath Made them alike, and both must live in death, Or everlasting life; both must commence Divines in Heav'n; ther's no preheminence, But all equality, all must express, With equal Joy, their equal Happiness. Rouze up dull man, and let thy wak'ned Soul Be vigilate; oh let thy thoughts enroul The love of God, engrave it in thy brest, That his resounding tongue may read thee blest. O let thy sighs, like Pens, and let thy tears Like Ink, transcribe the Love, th'indulgent cares Of thy Creator, that himselfe may find (Within th'unblotted volume of thy mind) Himselfe recorded, so will he imbrace Thy spotless Soul, and fill thee with his grace. Incline thine ears, and let thy heart rejoyce To hear the strains of his harmonious voyce: Harken, and thou shalt hear his Prophets sing Th'admired Mercies of the glorious King. Thus saith the great, and ever-living One, That rules the heav'ns, &amp; governs earth alone, Thus saith the Lord, that takes delight to dwel Amongst his Saints, that formed Israel, Created Jacob, let thy sorrows flee Out of thy brest, I have redeemed thee: 'Twas I that made thy clouded visage shine, And call'd thee by my Name, for thou art mine. I will be with thee, when thy feet shall wade Thorow the waters; I will be thy aid: Ile make thee walk thorow rivers, and the waves Shall prove ambitious to become thy slaves: And when thou walkest through the raging fire, Th'unruly flames shall not presume t'aspire Or kindle on thy garments. I alone The Lord thy God, and Israels holy One, And thy dear Saviour, that was always true, Gave Egypt, Seba, and Ethiopia too, To ransom thee; for thou wert my delight, And always Pretious in my gratious sight: Honors were heap'd upon thee, and thou wert The tender love of my affecting heart; Therefore even I, that am well pleas'd, will give People for thy dear sake, that thou mayst live. Fear not, for I am with thee, and Ile stand In thy defence, and my all-grasping hand Shall bring thy seed from the remotest places, And fill thee with my satisfying graces. 6. My tongue shall call unto the North, and say Unto the South, Give, and they shall obey; Bring from a far my sons and daughters all, Hear my loud voyce, be active when I call. 7. I have created them, and I proclaime They shall be call'd and honour'd by my Name. I'le usher forth the blind, and make them see The splendent Glories of my Majestie: I'le cure the deaf, and make their hearts rejoyce To hear the Ecchoes of my warbling voyce. Thus hath our God unty'd the tongues, and broke His Prophets lips; thus have his Prophets spoke: And wilt thou be (O Man) so much obdure, As not to credit him that will assure Perpetuall happinesse? Thou canst not ask That which he cannot give; do but unmask Thy shamefac'd Soul, that so thou mayst discry Jehovahs mercies with a faithfull eye: Descant upon his promises, advise With thine own thoughts, let Reason make thee wise; Inspect thy self, weigh well thine own condition, And thou shalt find thou want'st a good Physition To cure thy maculated Soul: Alas! Thou art like water stop'd up in a glass, So weakly fortify'd, and fenc'd about, That one weak knock soon lets the pris'ner out. Vaine lump of vanity, what can this Earth Afford thy thoughts more then a short-liv'd mirth? A mirth that fills thee with deluding toyes, And like a Tyrant afterwards destroyes. Dot'st thou on Earth? For what? Because her pleasure Can guild thy wanton eye? Because her treasure Can cram thy bags? Because her Sirens song Can ravish thee? Because her power can throng Thy Soul with luxury? Because her charms Can court thee with delight? Because her arms Can pleasingly imbrace thee, and impost Thy heart with gold, and lull thee, when th'ast lost Thy self in sleep? Is this the little All That this great world can boast of? Must we call These things our pleasures? No, they'l prove our cares, Our golden fetters, and our silken snares These are the Joyes we love, these are the things That make us fly with our Icarian wings Up to Ambitions Court, and there presume To gaze so long, untill our waxen plume Dissolve with heat, and like presumptuous slaves Tumble our selves into the raging waves Of speedy Ruine; Ruine's all that we Must hope t'obtaine from Earths base treasurie. Let's scorn her wealth, and say, O Earth, thou art A painted Mistresse with a rotten heart: Let's hate to love, that we may love to hate Th'unconstant glory of her fickle state. Even as the subtle Crocodile prepares Her flatt'ring heart, and eye-commanding tears, To wooe her prey to come within the power Of her command, that so she may devour With more facility, and make her jaws To execute by her tyrannike Laws: Even so this World, whose Crocodile-like eyes Are always flowing, wanting no supplies Of gliding tears to wash the rugged faces Of her designs with falsifying graces, That so she may by her too smooth delusion Make Man the Author of his own confusion. Frail flesh and blood, how canst thou take delight To love this world, that cannot give a mite Of comfort to thee, but will still intrap, And daily lull thee in her lustful lap. Shee'l rock thy soul to ruine, and shee'l spawn Basenesse into thee; shee'l deceive, and fawn Upon thy heart, and with her guilded baits Shee'l hook thy Soul unto the worst of fates: There's nothing in her that deserves the name Of Constancie; her glory is her shame. Smile at her tears, for every drop she vents Harbors ten thousand thousand discontents: Believe her not; but when she speaks the best, Believe the worst; and if she promise rest, Assure thy selfe of trouble; if she chance To promise treasure, let thy thoughts advance Above her promises, contemn her dross, For what thou gain'st from her will be thy loss: Let not her wealthy Do natives perswade Thy heart t'accept; when once thou art betray'd There's no resistance: They that well advise Before they act, deserve the name of wise: But they that study in her frantick Schools May prove her wise men; but Heav'ns out-cast fools. Aske her the way to Bliss: try if her skill Can give directions, aske her if she will Fill thee with blest Eternity, conjure Her helpless aid, see if she can assure A safety to thee, ask her if she can Prescribe a cure for a despairing Man; Tell her thy Soul is sick, thou canst not live A minute longer; see if she can give A Cordial to thee, see if she can heal A broken heart; see if she can reveal Celestial Joys unto thee, and impart A heav'nly comfort to thy grieved heart: If so, cheer up, and prosecute thy mirth, And say there is no other Heaven but Earth, Do thus (fond Man) and thou shalt quickly see A baffl'd World, that cannot answer thee, But must be silent, for she cannot plead For her own self; she knowes she cannot lead The way to Heav'n, she's but a bad director, A base Believer, and a worse Protector. Thus shalt thou make her envy swell and burst, And, like the Basilisk, discover'd first, She needs must dye; but if she should discover Thee first, farewell, th'art murder'd by thy lover. Then shalt thou heare the Soul-amazing tone Of him that sits on his immortall Throne, Pronounce against thee at the dreadfull day Of thy accounts; thus shalt thou hear him say: Depart, ye cursed off-springs of a father As curst as you, avoyd my sight, go gather The fruits of your deserts; you have forgot The God that made you, and I know ye not: See if the world, within whose folding arms You alwayes slept, can quit thee from the harms That must ensue; see if her flatt'ring power Can shelter thee, from the o're-flowing shower Of my fast-dropping rage; see if her brest Can entertain thee with eternall rest. Begone, begone, my fury hates to see Such Miscreants; had you remember'd me, I now had known you; had you made me eat When I was forc'd to importune for meat, I now would blesse you with celestiall dyet, And crown your Souls with everlasting quiet: Had you but quench'd my raging thirst, or gave A single drop, that very drop should save Your death-adjudged Souls, and you should sup Abundant comforts from my streaming cup: Had you (sad sons of vengeance) but supply'd My nakednesse with garments, when I cry'd And call'd upon your charity to send Reliefe unto me, I had been your friend; Or had your (more then marble) hearts reliev'd M'impris'ned body, now ye had not griev'd: Had you, you world-affined Souls, addrest Your selves unto me when I was opprest With ling'ring sicknesse, then I would have fed Your Souls (which now are starv'd) with heav'nly bread; But since you have not done it unto those Which I esteem'd, ye'ave prov'd your selves my foes: Therefore begone, let darknesse be your lot, Learn to remember that ye have forgot My mercies; go, and let my judgments dwell Within your guilty hearts; let black-mouth'd Hell Plague you with torments, let him always lash Your hearts with flames, until ye howl, and gnash Your teeth together; Go, depart my sight, And taste the fruits of everlasting night. But as for you, whose better deeds have found Acceptance in my heart, ye shall be crown'd With unremoved happinesse, because Ye have obsequiously perform'd my Laws; You fed my craving stomach, and you cloath'd My naked body, and you have not loath'd To visit me; and when I was a stranger, Ye took me in, and guarded me from danger: Go then my Lambs, and let your Oratory Proclaim the greatnesse of your Fathers glory: Go revel in my Courts; no discontent Shall breed a faction in my Parliament: Ile passe an Act of Peace, and it shall be Sign'd by the hand of my Eternitie. My tongue shall style you blessed, and my voyce Shall raise your Souls, and teach you to rejoyce: Your unexcised pleasures shall abound To infinite; your ravisht hearts shall sound The depth of my delights; all things shall move Within the sphere of uncontrouled Love: Be well assur'd, your pleasures shall be great; Then fly from Judgement to my Mercy-seat, And there rejoyce with a triumphant mirth; My Love shall live with them that hated Earth. Obdurate Man, here, here thou mayst descry Judgment and Mercy, one to terrifie, The other to perswade; and yet wilt thou Prove adamantine, and refuse to bow To thy Redeemer? Canst thou ruminate Upon his Love, and yet wilt not delate Thy Soul unto him? Is thy brazen heart Impenetrable? Will no flaming dart Of true affection enter? Hast thou vow'd To stop thy ears? Shall Mercy call aloud, And thou not hear? Shall thund'ring Judgments rattle About thy ears, and yet wilt thou imbattle Against the Lord of Hosts? Wilt thou invoke Perpetual Vengeance to intail a stroke Upon thy stubborn heart? What, dost thou think Hell's voyd of flames, or that thy God will wink At thine enormities? Go, rally all Thy thoughts together, and discreetly fall Into a serious study.— —Let thy mind Be absolute, and really enclin'd To meditation; contradict the rage Of thine own passion: labour to asswage The fire of lust, that so thou mayst behold, With more serenity, how manifold His mercies are, that every day prevents The sad incursions of deprav'd events. Think but in what a most defam'd condition Thy Soul was in, before the grand Physitian Of Heav'n and Earth spontaniously sent down A balm from his own Gilliard to Crown The sons of grief: Think what he did endure, Before his wounds had perfected thy cure. Remember how undauntedly he stood, And sweat himself into a Crimson flood To ransom thee; remember how his woes Were asperated by his raging foes; Remember how his sacred temples wore A spiny Crown; remember how it tore His sublime Front; remember how they broach'd His brest with Spears, and shamefully reproach'd His spotless fame; remember how they nail'd His spreading hands, remember how they scal'd His Ivory walls, remember how they spawl'd Upon his face, remember how they bawl'd And banded at his Agony, whilst he Prov'd patient Martyr to thair tyranny; Remember when he came unto the brink Of death, they gave him vinegar to drink: Nay more (because they vow'd to empty all Their poys'ned malice out) they gave him Gall. Oh bitter deed! Oh most abhorred Crimes! Too nearly paralleld in these our times.) Thus having put a period to their plots, They thought it good to cast their hellish lots For his (I dare not say mean) clothes; I know They were our Saviours, to whose worth we owe Perpetuall thanks; 'twas his well finished breath Redeem'd our Souls from everlasting death. Here's Love (O man) that does as far transcend Thy thoughts as thy deserts, that Heav'n should send His Son and Heir to be incarnated, And suffer death for thee, that wert as dead As sin could make thee; 'twas for thy offence He dy'd; Ah, how, how canst thou recompence Such high-bred Favours! Favours unexpected Deserve to be imbrac'd, and not neglected. Do not (rash Soul) like Cleopatra nurse Embosom'd vipers; blessings prove a curse, If once abus'd; Ingratitude cuts off Th'intail of Love; it is a shame to scoff At Benefactors; after thou art fed, Wilt thou contemn the hand that gave thee bread? Wouldst thou not love that friend that should bestow A superanuated crust, and shew Respect unto thee, when the ebbing tyde Of Fortune runs so low, that thou mayst ride Upon the sands of Poverty? Fond man, Strive to be gratefull, study how to scan The mercies of thy God; remember how He feeds thy Soul with Manna; learn to bow Th'unruly thoughts; (with admiration) think How often, and how much imbitter'd drink Thy Saviour drank; with what a doleful cry He beg'd of God to let that cup pass by; But knowing that his pleasure must be done, He prov'd himselfe his most obedient Son. And wilt thou not (coy wretch) drink one poor sup Of bitter drink for him, that drank a cup To sweeten thine? thou need'st not fear nor scorn To tast, because Heav'ns sacred Unicorn Hath purg'd the waters, and they must be sweet Except they're reimpoys'ned by thy feet: If so, what wilt thou do? where wilt thou find An Antidote for an invenom'd mind? It is reported, if the Spider chance To meet the obvious Toad, they'l both advance Their inward force, and mutually proclaim An open War; brave combatants of Fame! And having summon'd their imbowel'd might, March boldly on, and both incens'd, they fight: The Toad being heavy loaded, cannot go, Or wheel about, like his encountring foe, But keeps his ground, and makes a small resistance: The Spider scorning to be kept at distance, Falls in upon him, and with nimble rage Assaults his foe, who now begins t'asswage His former fury, and would fain retreat From his small foe, whose strength is grown too great For opposition; being thus distress'd He crawls away, and with a crop-sick brest Seeks for relief, and by and by discrys A Planton leafe, within whose veins there lies A secret Antidote, which did at length Expel his poyson, and renew his strength: Having disgorg'd himselfe, he soon returns Into the camp, where for a time he burns To be in action, and at last he sees The crafty Spider creeping by degrees To seize upon him, then his courage fails, He knows not what to do, his foe assails With all his might, constraning him to yield The conquest, and with shame to quit the field: Then he begins to seek, and hunt about, To find the soveraign healing Planton out, Which had before reliev'd him, and supply'd His wants; but that being gone, he burst, and dy'd Even so, if Hells black Spider chance to crawl From his infernal Web into the Hall Of this all-dusty World, he soon prepares Himselfe to fight, and suddenly declares, That he, the grim-look'd General of Hel, Dares to encounter any Souls that dwell Within the limits of the spacious Earth, And in a momemt qualifie their mirth: Thus Satan boasts, and if he chance to meet A single Soul, he'l thus begin to greet. A DIALOGUE Between the Soul and Satan. Sat. Soul, th'art well met. Sou. 'Tis true, for I am well. Sat. Say, wither art thou going? So. Not to Hel. Sat. Pish, talk no more of that, but tel me whither Thou go'st; come, prethee let's go both together. Sou. A pretty motion; when I want a guide Ile send for thee, till then thou art deny'd To be my Usher. Sat. Prethee tell me why Thou art so obstinate, as to deny So free a courtesie as I have shewn; Mischance oft falls to them that walk alone: Be not so much averse as to neglect This opportunity; I can protect Thy feet from sliding; dangers still attend Those that despise the favors of a friend. Sou. A friend! how canst thou prove that title? Sat. How? As thus; because I'm willing to allow The best assistance of my ready arm To guide, nay and protect thee from all harm; Therefore a friend. So. What you pretend to shew Is but external; he that can bestow Internal friendship on a Soul distress'd Is a true friend; no matter for the rest. If Heav'n will guide my Soul I shall not stray, Or fear the evils of a dangerous way: But as for you, I needs must borrow leave To say, your friendship's only to deceive; Confusion paths your ways, and if I run By your advise, I needs must be undon. God bids me fly from sin if I refuse Obedience to his will, I shall abuse His just commands; then will my sorrows cry, When Mercy stops, Judgment begins to fly. Sat. Desist (fond Soul) and labour to divorce Thy lips from this too fabulous discourse; Guild not thy words with vanity, perswade These thoughts (which are erronious) to evade Thy serious mind; advise, and thou shalt see My ways are best, be principl'd by me: Let not the swing of passion strike thee down, But follow me, 'tis I must give a Crown To thy deserts, 'tis I that can advance Thy down-cast Soul above the reach of chance; 'Tis I (mistaken Soul) 'tis I alone That must conduct thee to the sublime throne Of true Salvation; 'tis my hand must bring Thy trembling Soul before th'all-judging King Of Heaven and Earth; it is my power can fill Thy heart with joy; believe me, and I will. Trust not the babling languages of those That seem thy friends, but are thy greatest foes; They're great to thy destruction, they'l connive And fawn, nay almost bury thee alive; They'l talk of Heav'n and Hell, they tell thee stories Of endless, boundless, unconceived glories; They'l tell thee of Eternity, and woo Thy Soul out of thy ears, if thou'lt bestow Thy pains to hear them; they'l infuse, and brew Their own designs, and tell thee all is true That they declare; they'l tell thee that they're sent As Messengers from Heav'ns high Parliament. Believe me Soul, 'tis I that can display The Gospels Colours better far then they; There's nothing in that volume so obstruce, But I can winde and twist it to my use: And there is nothing in this world can be Stil'd worth a work, but can be done by me: I can do all, it lies within my power To make thee Poor or rich in half an hour: I can command whole Legions to attend Upon my honour: Say, what nobler friend Canst thou imbrace; I'le be a friend to all That will give audience to my faithful call; I'le make them swell with riches, they shall have As much, nay if not more, then they can crave: Am I not rare, and rich, and high, and great, Incomprehensible? Is not my seat The throne of happiness? Yet cannot I Invite thee to my sweet eternity? Come gentle Soul into my twining arms, I'le hug thee, I'le delight thee with my charms, I'le shew thee all my Joys, nothing shall lie Hid from the view of thy all-gazing eye: Happy, beyond expression. Sou. Satan, stay The Progress of thy tongue, and give me way, That I may vent my thoughts, for you have spoke At large already; and is this the stroke Which you intend shall wound me? Be assur'd, The blows but small, and well may be endur'd. Sat. What, mov'd to passion! Is thy mind disturb'd With foul mistrust? pray let those thoughts be curbd: What, dost thou think I am perfidious? Fie; 'Tis folly to condemn before you try. Alas, alas! what Profit can accrue To me by wronging such a Soul as you? What I express is onely for your good, But what is more (then grave advice) withstood? I doubt these weak, these empty thoughts presage A tempest, guarded with a storm of rage: Well then, storm on, and when thy storm is spent, Sit down and meditate, and then repent. Sou. Repent, Oh happy word! although exprest By a foul mouth; those that repent are blest. How dare thy hellish lips usurp a word Fill'd with divinity, but will afford No rest, no comfort, to thy horrid Soul? Begone, begone; and if thou canst condole Thy selfe, thou art (if Logick prove but true) Curst in the Major, and the Minor too. Bless me, O Heav'n: What blust'ring stormy weather Drove such a vile prodigious Monster hither? Touch-stone of baseness, dost thou come to prove Whether I'm gold, or dross? thou mayst remove Thy forward hopes, because I hope to be Metal at last for Heav'n, and not for thee. Begone, fallacious wretch, I cannot brook Thy golden baits, I have descry'd thy hook: Father of lyes, thy policy is built Upon the sands, and plaster'd o're with guilt: Thy tongue foretels a storm; if so, be sure Thy sand-built policy shall not endure: Flattery's the life of baseness, and that art Is well imprinted in thy subtile heart: Dost thou believe that I can entertain Belief from thee? Or dost thou think to raign Within my brest? No, no; thy cloudy powers Are at the best but falsifying showers: Be satisfi'd, I cannot give the least Of credit to thee, nor I dare not feast My thoughts with such uncertainties; I know Thy dyet must and will corrupt to woe. Thou bidst me not condemn! before I make Some tryal of thy trust; If I should take Such green advise, I quickly should undo My wretched selfe; and in condemning yo What profit could I have; or what reliefe Could I expect to mitigate my grief, My accusations would be blown as dust Before the wind; I'le neither try, nor trust. Sat. Nor try, nor trust? Art thou resolv'd to cross My real motions? Do, and see whose loss Will prove most weighty; if I lose the heat Of thy weak love, my loss will not be great; But if I should withdraw my love from thee, How like a map of well-drawn misery Wouldst thou appear? Be wise, corect thy thoughts; Neglected favors prove the greatest faults. Take my instructions, for 'tis I must bring Content unto thee; 'tis a glorious thing To be immortal: prethee Soul decline Thy former ways; say, shall I call thee mine? Mine; mine thou art; I'le load thee with renown; Let me but conquer, thou shalt wear the crown. How pleasing are my joys! how full of peace Are all my ways! my glories still increase: I'm great and good, I take delight to win Distressed Souls, and lead them from their sin: I cannot choose but pity those that lie Upon the beds of sensuality; My melting Soul is always free to give Comfort to them that study how to live. Alas, the care and trouble that I take Is more for their content, then my own sake: My gates are always open, they that venture To com to me shall (with a welcom) enter; And when they call, and cry, I will appeare My self unto them, and rejoyce to hear Their sad complaints; I will not hide my face From them that seek the glory of my grace: I cannot be unconstant; I must grieve To hear their sorrows, and I will relieve. I will be pitifull to them that trust In me alone, I cannot be unjust; I cannot, no I cannot; Earth shall move Sooner then I will falsifie my love: I am eternal; they that will endeavor To gain my love, shall have my heart for ever. Sou. 'Tis not your empty words shall make my brest Stoop to the flatt'ry of thy vain request; Though I have ears to hear, I have a mind That will not shake at the hard breathing wind Of your discourse; what you pretend for reason Is nothing but the froth of private treason: 'Tis not your multiloquious tongue can turn The Bias of my Soul, or make me spurn At holy Writs; 'tis not your fond conceit Of being good, shall make me to retreat From Heav'ns Commands; 'tis not your promis'd joys Can make me cheerfull: or your painted toys Can lure me to your fist; 'tis not the dart Of your vain love can penetrate my heart; 'Tis not your seeming clemency can make My Soul to love you, for your Pities sake; 'Tis not your always-open gates that shall Intice my steps to your large Guilded Hall; 'Tis not your selfe-appearance shall invite My well-composed thoughts to your delight; 'Tis not your greatness that shall make me yield To your desires; Religion is my sheild: Ile neither fear nor love your rash evasions, Nor give attendance to your smooth perswasions: 'Tis difficult to serve two Masters well; Who strays from Heav'n must needs approach to Hell. I am advis'd to shun the broad-path'd ways That lead to ruine; what the Scripture says I must believe; 'Tis dangerous to fly Without the wings of true divinity: The Scriptures are my way, my light, my guide, And they that go without them needs must slide: The paths are strait in which I ought to run The course of grace, untill my days are done; And they that change a virtue for a vice, Deserve no fruit from Heav'ns blest Paradise. Sat. Surcease those fond conceits, thou dost but spin Thine own destructions, and connive at sin: Urge not the Scriptures, for I dare maintain My paths are best, and other ways are vain: Thy Scripture-conscience will at last confound Th'amazed thoughts, and give thy Soul a wound That hates a cure, then shalt thou prove unblest, Whilst others find the plainest road's the best. Suppose thou wert (I speak it for thy sake) Mov'd by occasions, forc'd to undertake A long-way'd journey, woulst thou not enquire The readiest way, but run into the mire? If thou shouldst act a crime so fouly bad, Folly would stile thee fool, and Wisdome mad. Stray not into the wilderness of grief, But come to me, take courage, and be brief In thy designs; perswade thy selfe, that I Am both thy light, thy way, and best supply In time of need; I am thy prop, thy stay; Therefore resolve, and trifle not away Thy thriftless Soul, be not thy selfe-destroyer; I'le be thy love, and thou my Loves enjoyer: Know that my real brest contrives no end, But what may merit so divine a friend As thine own selfe: Folly and wisdom lies Before thy face; be either fool, or wise: Protract no time, but make a speedy choyce, Thy welfare shall instruct me to rejoyce; Observe my actions, pry into my parts, Let's know each other by exchange of hearts; I'le give thee mine, and for my love restore Thine unto me; grant this, Ile ask no more. Be free to give, as I am free to crave; Th'adst better live my friend, than dye my slave: For if thou shalt deny what I desire, Ile make my bellows to advance the fire Of thy distress, and sorrows shall corrode Thy stubborn heart, and care shall make abode Within thy breast; perpetuated grief Shall find a voyce, but ramble from relief. Ile gripe thee, till I make thee understand The fiery language of my furious hand: Sighings, and groaning, sobs, and tears, and cries, Shall be thy sad Concomitants; thine eyes Shall stare upon (well may I call them new And horrid) lights, such lights as shall renew Thy growing torments; every thing shall be Thy fellow-slaves in servile miserie: I'le yoke thee with distress, nay and I'le chain Thy struggling Soul with everlasting pain: I'le crow'd thee full of sorrows, and I'le double Thy unconceived, uncontrouled trouble, Whilst I, triumphing I, will sit aloft, And be ador'd, and scoffe to see thee scofft: Pity shall be a stranger to my brest; My care shall be to make thy Soul unblest: The tydes of woe shall overflow thy thoughts, And be equivalent unto thy faults; Be sure, that what extremity can be Thought worth the using, shall be us'd on thee: Now I have spoke, if thou wilt not repent I'le cease to speake, and study to torment. Sou. How full of poyson's every word that flows Out of thy mouth? What trust can I repose In such a flatterer? I dare not try, Or throw my selfe upon thy courtesie: I know thou canst not answer my request; There is no trust in a selfe-praising brest. If I should dive into the deep abyss Of thy black thoughts, what glory, or what bliss Should I discern? Or if I should deliver My heart to thee, thou'dst disrespect the giver; Though at the first perhaps thou wouldst express A seeming-unbeseeming thankfulness, Yet at the last I know thou wouldst decline Thy promis'd ways, and stile me to be thine. Fair words find easie passage, they proceed But from the tongue, th'event stil crowns the deed. Three things denote a friend; first to conceal A secret speech: the next is, to reveal A private good; the last is, to advise The safest way t'obtain an enterprise: And he that can do this, as you pretend, Deserves the title of a real friend: But my Religion tutors me to say, (Nay and affirm,) You neither can, nor may; I'm sure it is (if reason dare prove true) One thing to speak, another thing to do. Your words are airy messengers, which fly Into my ears, and there enroul a lye: Many untruths have broke the common Goal Of thy foul mouth; thou sayst thou canst prevail To make me glorious, and thou canst encrease My Joys, and crown me with eternal peace: Thou sayst th'art good and great, &amp; that thy paths Lead to Salvation; thou declar'st thy Laws To be most just: if all these things be true, I needs must call the Scriptures false, or you: Truth bids me tell thee boldly, when thou cry'st Th'art great, and good, and rich, and rare, thou ly'st: If thou art good and great, pray tell me why Thou wilt behold so vile a wretch as I? These things bespeak thee humble, unto which Thou plead'st not guilty; and if thou art rich, How can it be, that thou wilt condescend To feed my wants, that am so poor a friend? Strange is that charity, which seems to shine From such a diabolick brest as thine. If my beliefe could keep an equal pace With thy swift tongue, how full of Faith &amp; Grace Should I appear? Such Faith as would devast My wanton Soul, and make me weep as fast. It is impossible to find a Sion That has no Governor, except a Lyon. The Souls Petition to God. Oh Heav'n, I crave that thou wouldst keep me still From this most vile Progenitor of Ill; Suffer him not t'infold me in his arms, Or overcome me with his wanton charms: Oh make my heart obdure, that he may knock Upon my Soul, as on a Marble Rock; Be thou my Fort, and then I shall endure His furious on-sets, and repose secure: Give me thy grace, that I may be content; Make me as strong, as he is impudent. Now let the spring-tyde of thy fierce desires Flow to the height, thou shalt not quench my fires: Know Satan, know, my heart reserves no place For thy abode, I scorn thee to thy face: The well-dy'd colours of my Soul declares Defiance to thee, and my brest prepares To give thee battle; strike, I fear thee not; Who's arm'd with Faith, needs fear no Cannon shot. Sat. What impious tongue is that which dares defie My power with so much boldnesse? So. Wretch, 'tis I; 'Tis I (infernall Traytor) that will spend My strength to prove thou art a flatt'ring friend. Sat. Move me to anger, do, and thou shallt find A courteous friend at last may prove unkinde: Have I not woo'd thee almost night and day To goe to Heaven? Sou. The quite contrary way. Sat. Have I not labour'd like a watchfull father To nourish thee? Sou. Or like a Devill rather. Sat. Have I not alwayes taken great delight? Soul. To take away good gold, and give me light. Sat. How much nocturnall and diurnall care Have I sustain'd for thee? Sou. True, t'insnare. Sat. Have I not been assiduous to await Upon thy pleasure? Sou. and corrupt my state. Sat. Have I not proffer'd all that can be given To a sick Soul? Sou. To drive my Soul from Heaven. Sat. Did I not promise to be true and just? Sou. Did I not say, I'de neither try nor trust? Sat. Did I not promise that I'de make thee wise? Sou. Did I not say thou wert compos'd of lyes? Sat. Did I not promise to encrease thy store? Sou. Did I not say such wealth would make me poor? Sat. Did I not promise to advance thy flame? Sou. Did I not say thy honours were thy shame? Sat. Did I not promise to uphold thy peace? Sou. Did I not say such warres would never cease? Sat. Did I not promise thee a Crown of life? Sou. Did I not say that Crown would Crown my strife? Sat. Did I not promise thee eternall glory? Sou. Did I not say that promise was a story? Sat. Did I not promise I would give thee all? Sou. Did I not say such promises were small? Sat. Did I not tell thee I was great and good? Sou. Did I not answer 'twas in shedding blood? Sat. Did I not tell thee that my wayes were best? Sou. Did I not answer that they were unblest? Sat. Did I not tell thee that thou shouldst have joy? Sou. Did I not answer such as would destroy? Sat. Did I not tell thee that I did lament? Sou. Did I not answer that I was content? Sat. Did I not tell thee what a friend I'd prove? Sou. Did I not answer that I could not love? Sat. Thus by fair terms I labour'd to obtain, Sou. Thus in foul terms I told thee 'twas in vain. Sat. Then I begin to threaten thee with grief, Sou. And then I fled to Heav'n, and found relief. Sat. I threatened to afflict thee with large pains, Sou. I told thee such afflictions were my gains. Sat. I told thee more than now I will expresse, Sou. My answers made thee wish I had spoke lesse. Sat. But now I see my real words can find No rest within the center of thy mind; For 'tis in vain to sow the seeds of life In a dead heart that is manur'd with strife: Ile therefore cease my importuning love, I'le shew my Serpent, and keep close my Dove. Do, doe thy worst, vile wretch, I'le make thee know Griefes abstract, and the quintessence of woe; I'le load thee with extremities, thy brest Shall alwayes crave, but find no place of rest: Had but my grave advise receiv'd a place Within thy heart, thou hadst been fill'd with grace; But now the inundations of thy trouble Shall overflow thee, and I will redouble My new contrived plagues; I'le make thee feel My melting heart is now transform'd to steel: Thy tongue shall (like a bolt of thunder) roul And roar within thy mouth; thy sulphurous Soul Shall flash forth lightening, and thy blood-red eyes Shall blaze like Comets in the troubled Skies; Thy teeth shall gnash, as if they scorn'd to be Concomitants in so much misery: Oh how I'le carbonado every part, And fill thy body with increasing smart; Thy Soul shall lure for death, but that shall hate To pierce upon thee, and contemn thy state: Life shall be still incroaching, but thy breath Shall scorn that life, and hate it unto death; Thy flesh shall drop forth brimstone, and thy bones Shall court each other in their crackling tones; Horror shall be thy watchman, curses shall Possess thy tongue, one torment still shall call Upon another; when thy voyce shall cry But for a drop; Confusion shall reply, No, no, thou shalt not; if a golden Myne Could buy a drop, that drop should not be thine: Then shalt thou say, if thou hadst been at first Advis'd by me, thou hadst not been accurst: Thus in this sad Dilemma shalt thou roar, And crave my succour, but I'le not deplore Thy woful state, because thou wert averse To goodness, after folly comes a curse: Then shalt thou know and find I will exile All thoughts of pity, and I'le rather smile Than grieve at thy distress; ah know, tis hard To force an entrance where the gates are bar'd: Fond Soul, be serious, let thy thought reflect On my indulgency, and give respect Unto my clemency; believe I will Be good to thee, do but forsake thy ill; Forsake, forsake that evill which will turn To thy destruction; do not, do not burn The precious fuel of thy chaste desires In idle, wanton, all consuming fires The post of Time is swift: and knows no stay; Tis time to go when Reason calls away: Protraction's dangerous; it is not good To strive with that which scorns to be withstood. Then do not thou procrastinate, but take This opportunity, do but forsake Thy former ways, and readily incline Thy selfe to me, and I will make thee shine With so much lustre, that all eyes shall gaze Upon thy brightnes, and admire with praise: Oh may my language teach thee to believe, That so my torments may not make thee grieve In utter darknesse, that thou mayst imbrace Those glories, which adorn my peaceful place: Repent, (dear Soul) repent what thou hast done, Then call me father, and Ile love my son: Thus having told thee all, I'le here desist; Be thou more apt to yield than to resist. Sou. I find, I find you first inflict a wound And then with balsom strive to make it sound: You make me smile at first, but after groan; One hand incloses bread, the other stone; I fain would take the bread, but that I stand In fear and danger of the stony hand: Therefore, to shun all danger, I'le despise Your fond advise, and practise to be wise: If all should prove, that you have told me, true, I know the best and worst that thou canst doe; As for your threatnings, they shall not disturb My peacefull thoughts, my faith shall be their curb: Urge me no more, but let me rest in quiet, Strong is that stomack can digest thy diet. Sat. And is it so? Will no perswasions work Upon thy thoughts? Those pregnant crimes that lurk Within thy brest, will, like to Scorpions, gnaw Thy groaning heart; such sorrow knowes no Law; But since thou wilt not be advis'd, expect To find reward, as I have found neglect. Ah, why fond wretch, why dost thou thus provide Thy feeble self to strive against the tyde? Alas, alas! why art thou lull'd asleep In follies lap? Rouze up for shame, and weep For thine infirmities; be not thus cross To him that would preserve thee from a losse: 'Tis time to cast away the works of night And cloath thee with the shining robes of light. Sou. If your strong Oratory had the skill To make me yield to your unsatiate will, It were enough; what more could you desire, Than a bad period to your bad desire? But stay (bold friend) I'le meditate and see What fruit will spring from thine infernal tree. Sat. What, must I stay (vile wretch) till you dispute And prove the goodnesse of my pleasing fruit? Must I be alwayes waiting on the train Of your desires, and spend my time in vaine? No, no, I will not; for it is unfit I should attend, if you will not submit: Th'incensed fury of my spirits burn To be in action, I will not adjourn A minute longer; goe, and hug thy vice, Thou lov'st the bargain, but abhor'st the price: Urge me no more, away, I have forgot All thoughts of friendship, and I know thee not: And here I leave thee to the lawlesse power Of thine own passion; cursed be that hour That brought thee forth; if all this will not do, May all men curse thee, and I'le curse thee too. Sou. And can the spring of thy affections find So soon an Autumn? Canst thou be unkind With so much ease? And can your real brest (As you so call't) be so soon dispossest Of love and patience? Oh how bad and strange Is the effect of such a sudden change! 'Tis disputable, for I know not whether Anger, or policy, or both together, Wharft thee to these extreams: well then pursue Thine owne desires, and I will bid adue To all thy follies; yet my heart begun T'expand it selfe before the glim'ring Sun Of thy perswasions; if thy sharp'ned rage Had not so soon exploded me the stage, I fear, I fear, I have before this hour Been prostituted to thy tamelesse power: Begone, begone; but stay, hark Satan, hark, Go boast you shot, but fairly miss'd the mark. Sat. Why dost thou bid me goe? I'm sure you speak (As I have done) in jest, thou wilt not break The bonds of friendship; though thou hast exprest Thy selfe in anger, yet thou art in jest: Those good conceits that live in th'inner places Of my close heart, tells me th'art fill'd with graces: But there is none that can proclaim and cry They're free from rage, no not so much as I: When I am angry, then my heart is pleas'd, Because I'm satisfy'd; my mind is eas'd Of a most pressing load, which seems to tire And waste me with a brest-consuming fire. “A wise mans eare must alwayes entertain “Things spoke in passion to be void and vaine: “The tongue's a restlesse member, and oft-times “Out-runs the wit, and then it flyes and climbs Above all sense: “When Reason finds divorce, “The tongue proves subject to a headlong course. What I have spoke observe, and thou shalt find Proceeded from my passion, not my minde: The misconstruction of a word may make The dearest friends to vary, and forsake The plains of friendship, though their hearts are free From the curst evills of Inconstancy: Therefore mistake me not, nor doe not thou Construe my words with an incensed brow: Smile on me then, and cheerfully impart The loving chidings of a friendly heart; Then shalt thou see with what a willing arm I will conduct and guide thee from all harm: Believe me Soul, I am not come to scatter Uncertain stories, but a reall matter; What I hold forth unto thee, is the stem Of a pure heart, thou art the onely Jem Shall grow upon it; come, and let's combine, I shall rejoyce to see thee prove divine. Sou. The Bias of thy Love runs now so strong, That I much feare 'twill not continue long; I finde, I finde thou hast the art to saile With any winde; thou labour'st to prevail, But 'tis in vain, for know, I'le trust thee not, My zealous heart is fearfull of a plot: I cannot be so foolish as to trust Without assurance that thou wilt be just: Wilt thou be true? Speak with a real breath. Sat. I will be just (believe me) unto death; I will, I will; oh may I never be True to my self, if I am false to thee. Sou. If thou art just and constant, tell me where Thy seat is plac'd, aud who is Prince of th'air; Be true in this, and thou shalt find that I, According to thy answer, will reply. Sat. I'le tell thee then (because I'le now fulfill The vast desires of thy enquiring will) Where my refulgent Seat is plac't; prepare Thy ears to hear, I'le speedily declare. The large extent of my unbounded grace Cannot be comprehended in one place, Because I am immortall, unconfin'd To time or place; I live in every mind That's truly real, and not disagreeing To my known Lawes; I have no local Being: The World's a spacious Body, I the Soul Which lives in every part compleat and whole: Thus this dispute is easily decided, For what's immortal cannot be divided. Nay more, because I'le fill thee with content, I say I'm Prince of every Element, Therefore of Air: Now if thou canst enquire Any thing more, I'le answer thy desire. Sou. Before I suffer my swift thoughts to slide Into more questions, I'le be satisfy'd In what is past: If so it be, you have No local Being, how then will you save Those Hosts of Souls which you intend shall be Seal'd with the Signet of Eternitie? Did you not tell me, that your peacefull Seat Was rich, sublime, (and without measure) great? If thus it be, as 'tis exprest by you, 'Tis more than strange that 'tis not local too: Clear but this doubt, and thou shalt quickly find Those duties that attend an honest mind Flow from my brest, till then I'le rest in peace, As you perform, so shall my love encrease. Sat. Ambiguous Soul, why dost thou thus connive At thine own follies? Why dost thou deprive Thy self of comfort, comforts that will heal Th'exulcerous sores of thy distemper'd weal? Why art thou thus inquisitive? the thing That thou desir'st to know (if known) will bring Small satisfaction to thy dubious brest; He's wise enough that knowes he shall be blest: If you enquire in such a doubtfull case, You'l loose your rest in seeking out the place. Surcease thy thoughts, and do not proudly knock Thy self in pieces, now thou knowst the rock: Pry not too far, let secret things alone, My Zodiack has more signs than must be known: 'Tis not the Heav'n of Heav'ns that can contain Me, the Creator, and my glorious train: I am even what I please, and I will be Even where I will. So. Where's that? Sa. What's that to thee? The knowledg of my Seat does no way tend To thy salvation, therefore cease to spend Such fruitlesse thoughts, cast by this needlesse care, Learn to know what I am, no matter where. Sou. I must confesse, it is not good to pry In things that suit not the capacity; But seeing 'twas your pleasure to expresse So much of friendship, I made bold t'addresse My self unto you; pardon then my crimes, You know that wisest men may doubt sometimes: Your weights are light, or else your courage fail's, You have not strength enough to turn the scales Of my affections, yet you had almost Droven my ill man'd ship upon your Coast, The winds of your perswasions rage and roar Within my brest I cannot find a shoar For my desires; I'm tost from wave to wave, And am become a most distracted slave: Those heavenly thoughts which formerly frequented The closet of my brest are now prevented By base bred fancies, fancies that arise From a foule brain and makes me to despise Almost my self; I know not what to do, I dare not, oh I dare not yeild to you; And yet I hardly can believe thou wilt Burthen thy conscience with so foul a guilt As to betray me, sure thou art more kind Than to abuse a well-affected mind; But yet I dare not trust a Soul pursuer, Because thou kill'st when thou pretend'st to cure. I reel I reel (if not sustain'd) I shall Receive a sudden and a deadly fall; What shall I do in this deplor'd condition? I feare, I fear I've lost my best Physician: Try Satan, try, and see what may be done For a sick Soul, that foolishly has run Beyond it self; oh see what thou canst do To give me ease, and then I'le call thee true. Sat. Now Soul I love thee; rouze, bid grief depart, Thou hast the symptomes of an honest heart: Me thinks I could, with much content, afford To say thou speak'st a Christian at a word; Cheer up, and know that many troubles wait Upon the changes of an ancient State: The work of Reformation alwayes brings Trouble at first, but afterwards it sings Anthems of Peace, whose fortunate event Will more than countervail thy discontent. He that has spent the treasure of his dayes Under one roof, has reason to dispraise The troubles of removing; yet at last (When his defatigating cares are past) He may declare himself to be a debter To fortune, and confesse that life the better. Even so mayst thou (dear soul) hereafter say, Blest be that hand which led thee from the way And paths of Ignorance, although at first ['Tis often known, beginnings are the worst] Thou feel'st a private nakednesse within, Because thou hast uncloth'd thy self of sin: Although, I must confesse, there cannot be A vacuum in nature, yet in thee There is an emptinesse, and must be still, For what is empty, craves a time to fill. If he whose stomack hath sustain'd the rage Of sharp'ning hunger, should at first asswage His appetite with fulnesse, would it not Produce a surfeit, and impose a blot Upon his wisdome, raising such a strife Within his Microcosmus, that his life Would be endanger'd? Therefore learn by rote, That moderation is the chiefest note: In all my Gammut, none can sing so high A note as moderation, only I. If I should let thee make too large a meale Of my rich Joyes at first, I should reveale Too much of folly; for if thou shouldst take A surfeit at the first, It needs must make Thee fear, nay hate, to entertain my diet; 'Tis better far to spare at first then riot: Moreover, should I let thee taste thy fill At first, I know the reins of thy fierce will Would scorn a hand, 'tis dangerous to trust; Presumptions spur can never want for rust: Come soul, let Reason rule thee, doe not stain Thy well-dy'd judgment, 'tis a greater pain To fear, than suffer; come, I long to see Thee wanton with me in Eternitie; Then doubt no more, resolve, and let's away, There is no greater grief than to delay A happinesse; be well inform'd of this, Procrastination is a foe to Bliss. Sou. Thy words imposthumate my heart, I feel A greater pain than ever Ixions wheel Knew how t'inflict, extremities still crowd Into my thoughts; my sorrowes call aloud, And none will heare; what shall I do; for I Unworthy am to live, unfit to dye; Except th'all ruling power above will please T'inspect my Soule, and furnish me with ease, To whose blest ears I'le recommend my suit. My sorrows will not let my tongue be mute. Great Auditor of groans, oh let my cryes, My sighs, my tears, invite thine eares, thine eyes To hear, and view me; for I must confesse, My crimes are great, and I am nothing lesse Than what is least; alas! and nothing better Than what is worst, oh pardon me thy debter: I'm tost with grief, and know not where to steer My ship wrack'd self, but still my sins appear Before my face, whose looks almost affright, And make me start into eternall night: What shall I do? or whither shall I flee, That am an alien (Lord) except to thee? From thee I cannot, and I am too vile To come unto thee, having made a spoyl Of those most sacred mercies, which thy hand Confer'd upon me; there is no Command But I have broke; yet, gracious Lord, I know That thy abounding mercies can o'reflow My sand excelling sins, which cannot lie Absconded from thine all-surveying eye. With shame I must confesse the subtile art Of Satan hath impoysoned my heart; Oh I am sick to death, I swell, I burst Never was any soul so much accurst. There's none but thee, thou sacred antidote Can cure my grief, be therefore pleas'd to note My sad condition, let my sorrowes lye Before thy face, oh heare me when I cry; Grant me the shield of faith, that I may stand In opposition to the powerfull hand Of active Satan, weaken (Lord) his power And add unto my strength; let every hour Afford new mercies, mercies that may sail Into my breast, ah should my Foe prevail, Oh, then I perish, shorten (Lord) his chaine And lengthen out my patience, oh make vaine His fierce attempts, that he may feel, and see When he is strongest, I'm as strong as he, Then shall my lips extoll thee, and proclaime The greatnesse of thy glory, and his shame. Give but thy grace unto me (Lord) and then Say what thou wilt, my tongue shall say Amen. Let everlasting plagues and horror dwell Within so fit a soul, let black-mouth'd Hell Remove his scituation, and take An everlasting Lease, oh let him make A Ten'ment of thee; dost thou think that I Will heare thy prayers? oh no, I scorn thee, fye Away, begon— Sou. What voyce is this, that makes this bold intrusion Into my eares, and grumbles out confusion? Me thinks I see a storme-portending cloud, Bowel'd with thunder, and I hear a loud And horrid noise, a noyse that will confound A well-prepared eare, to heare the sound; Who would not quake at such a voice as this That roares forth Malice, with an Emphasis? My thoughts are interrupted, and amasement, Flashes light Lightning through the brittle casement Of my ill glased-brest; It cannot be The voice of Heav'n, a God so pure as he Hates to be envious, malice cannot spring From such a good (and love-composed) King: Although his voyce (made terrible) oft-times By the addition of mans dayly crimes Thunders against a sinner, yet his breath Can take no pleasure in a sinners death. Hereafter (Lord) when malice findes a voyce To speak, my understanding shall rejoyce, In knowing who it is, this heart of mine Shall never quake at any voyce but thine; Then let hels deep-mouth'd blood-hound, roar &amp; thunder Ile neither fear, nor love, nor quake, nor wonder. For 'tis not strange to heare a Lyon roare That wants his prey, the more he has, the more He seeks for more, imploying still his power In seeking how, and whom he may devour: Know therefore Sathan, that I am prepar'd To meet thee, and I will not be out-dar'd; Tis not thy false malifluous tongue shall tempt My heart to love, no, nor thy rage exempt My thoughts from heav'n, although thy craft still lurks For opportunity to stop good works; When I compose my self, and strive to pray, Thou seek'st to turn my thoughts another way. Thou great corrupter of Diviner parts, Thou watchfull thief that steal'st into the hearts Of filly mortals, think not to devour My armed heart, with thy pursuing power. Sat. Will nothing move thee? wilt thou still mistrust? If faire meanes will not move thee, foul meanes must, What dost thou think, my arm is grown so short It cannot reach thee? dost thou think to sport With my commands? say, thou imperious mite Who gave thee being, who created light, Who made the Heav'ns, the earth, the sea, reply Audacious wretch, speak, was it thee, or I? Thou vain contender, dost thou think to gaine By striving with me, any thing but paine, Oh no, thou shalt not, for I'le still renue Thy pinching sorrows, therefore bid adue To all thy comforts, for thou shalt no more Inioy those blessings thou inioyd'st before, Oh how thy horrid tongue shall roar and cry With Dives for a drop, but no supply Shall dare t'appear; the more thou crav'st, the less Thou shalt be heard, for nothing shall expresse The least of pleasure to thy per-boyl'd heart, Thy chiefest food shall be perpetuall smart. Be well assured that thy eares, thy eyes Shall hear, nor see, nought but extremities, Begon, begon, my fury hates delay, Hell, and damnation be thy lot, away. Sou. Experience makes me understand thou art A lively actor, of a deadly part, I find the greatnesse of your swelling rage; Your Prologue speaks 'twould be a bloudy stage If you might act as King, but Heav'n prevent The cursed plots of your accurst intent; I fear thee not, because I know thy power Is limitted, and thou canst not devoure Without commission, therefore do thy worst, And let thy envie swell untill it burst And fall to nothing, my Creator gives Me faith to say that my Redeemer lives, And will protect me from the rage of those That are my known and secret deadly Foes. Thy thundring words shall not make me complying For he's unwise that dyes for fear of dying; Thus being guarded with the shield of grace Ile spit defiance in thine impious face. Thou art a Lyon, and thou seek'st for blood How bad'ds that soul that dares to think thee good; Urge me no more, cashiere thy fruitlesse trouble, The more thou striv'st, the more Ile strive to double My resolutions, for I dare not venture To rest my heart on such a bloody center, Oh no I dare not; he that shall let goe, A certain friend, for a most certain foe, Justly deserves, to have no other fame, But what reproach can build upon his name; Should I permit my rambling thoughts to glance Upon thy love, the Plea of Ignorance Could not be prevalent, because 'tis known Unto the blest-united three in one That I (by his assistance) have discry'd Thy real flat'ry, and thy humble pride; I dare affirm no greater pride can be Then that that's acted with humility, But here I'le stop and leave thee to inherit Th'effects of a diabolique spirit. Sat. Accursed chatiffe, dost thou think to scape The fury of my hand, or make a rape Upon my goodnesse? no, the Sun and Moon Shall stop their usuall progresses as soon As I will change my mind; vengeance is mine And I'le repay it, on that Soul of thine. Begon, begon, expect thy sudden doom, It is thy sins, give punishment a room: Let everlasting Plagues, and horrour dwell Within so fit a Soul; let black-mouth'd Hell Remove his scituation, and so take A still continuing Lease, oh let him make A ten'ment of thee, dost thou think that I Will hear thy Prayers? oh no I scorn thee, fye Away, begon— Sou. If words could kill, I had been ere this time Worded to death, but now I hope to clime Above the reach of words in thy despight, Where thou may'st grumble at me, but not bite Even as the surly blood desiring dog Ty'd with a chain, or loaded with a clog Growes fiercer with restraint, and stands in awe Of nothing but his master, to whose law He must submit and keep within his list; For fear will not permit him to resist: But if some wandring passenger should chance To walk along, he quickly would advance His watchfull head, and running too and fro From place to place, he tuggs but cannot goe Beyond his bounds, but labours still in vaine (With fruitlesse biting of his senslesse chaine) To free himself, but when he finds his strength Is not sufficient to out goe the length Of his well-fastned chain, he soon divides His sharp fang'd jawes, and bauls untill his sides And lungs are weary, then he runs the round Untill he layes himself upon the ground: Where he remaineth much displeas'd and vext, Seeming to threaten ruin to the next. So you (hels ty dog) if thou couldst but strain And quit thy self from heaven's fast holding chain What Soul could scape thy jawes, or be possest Of lasting peace, or comfortable rest? How sad, how miserable had it been For patient Job, had but thy power been seen Upon his heart; but Heaven that will controul In spight of malice, chain'd thee from his soul: Alas, alas! Thy chain is not so long, To reach a soul, nor is thy power so strong To break it at thy pleasure, thou mayst baul And bark forth envy, but not hurt at all; If thou art God [as thou pretendest] why, Why dost thou suffer such a thing as I T'expostulate so long, and dost not show Thy judgements in my speedy overthrow? Sat. It is my goodnesse, and not thy desert That breeds forbearance in my tender heart, Alas, alas, what honour would acrue To me in conquering such a thing as you, I could within a moments time asswage, (But that my clemency out-vies my rage) Thy swelling fury, for I could discharge Vollies of wrath, and easily inlarge Thy restlesse torments, I could make thee run (Like morning mists before the rising Sun) Out of my presence, If I should but say The word begon, alas thou couldst not stay, But, ah, I cannot, for I hate to harme, Love guides my strength, &amp; that strength guides my arm. So. Even as the Sheepheard with bedewed locks Watches the feeding of his harmlesse flocks For fear the bold-fac'd Wolf should chance to peep Into the coasts of his beloved sheep, And like a lawlesse Tyrant, soon commence (Against those Emblems, of pure innocence) A bloody action, which would soon incite The Sheepheards grief, to see so sad a sight, So I th'eternall Sheepheard daily watch My wel fed Lambs, for fear Hels wolf should catch Or fright (not being fearfull to be bold) My gentle flocks from their delightfull fold; I am beloved, and mine own, will own My sacred Name, my voyce is not unknown Unto my Sheep, they alwayes will be all Firmly obedient to my cheerfull call, For which obedience they shall find reward Nay such a one, as alwayes shall accord To their desires, thrice happy shall they be In truly calling, and in owning me To be their Sheepheard, nothing can more please M' indulgent soul, then such dear flocks as these, I will preserve them, and no wolf shall dare To seize upon them, or presume to teare Their downy fleeces, nothing shall be nearer Unto my heart, and nothing shall be dearer In my affections, for I will affect Even where, and when I finde a true respect. What strange contusions hath thy language bred Within my serious thoughts? how hast thou fed My ears with flatteries, but it is in vaine; Because my heart hath vow'd not to retaine Thy fain'd expressions, nothing shall remove My love from God, nor nothing make me love Thy wretched self; then be content, and cease To urge my mind, or interrupt my Peace. Go, doe thy worst, And when that worst is done Sit downe as wisely, as thou hast begun. Sat. Art thou resolv'd? Well then, let vengance light Upon thy cursed head, begon, thou mite (Nay lesse) of goodnesse, go, make haste t'inherit Those plagues that wait upon so damn'd a spirit. Sou. May this be call'd a farewell, if it be, The self same farewell must attend on thee; I hate, nay, scorn to bid farewell to you, Tis charity enough to bid, adieu. The Souls Thankefulnesse, and Request to God. Most gracious God, I having lately felt The fervour of thy mercies, needs must melt Into a thankfulnesse, Ah should I be Ungratefull to so blest a God as thee 'Twere pity, ah 'twere pity, that the ayr Should give me breath, or thy fierce hand forbear To throw me headlong to the deep abiss Of speedy ruine, where no comfort is: Oh glorious Lord, be pleased to inflame My heart with raptures, to extoll thy name; Alas I'm weak, and if thou shouldst deny Thy ayde, nothing could be more weak than I. If thou wilt help me, I shall be so strong That nothing can prevail to doe me wrong. Lord, I am blind, oh therefore let thy light Expell those clouds, that thus eclipse my sight; Be thou my guide, my strength, my sight, my way, Or else (being weak) I shall, or fall, or stray; Oh leave me not, but as thou hast begun To shew me mercy, let thy mercy run With my desires, and grant that I may be A true forgetter of all things, but thee: And rather then I should forget thy call, Oh let me have no memory at all; Wean me, oh wean me from this nursing earth, Make it my sorrow, and thy Throne my mirth. Let every morning make me know, and say Thy Lawes are Just, or let me know no day; Let every ev'ning, or make me take delight In thy commands, or let me know no night. Inspire my heart [O God] and make it glad Alwayes in thee, or make it alwayes sad; If thou afflict'st me, make me understand, Thou hast a storming, and a calming hand; If Poverty oppresse me, whilst I live, Oh let thy mercy send me friends to give; Or if thy goodnesse please to send me store O give me grace to think I may be poor. It matters not, O Lord, how poor I be Unto the world, if I am rich to thee: If I am hungry, ô be thou my meat, If I am weary, ô be thou my seat; Or if I feast, O Lord, be thou my guest; If I am restlesse, Lord, be thou my rest; If I am thirsty, Lord, be thou my spring; If I am subject, Lord, be thou my King; If I have vertue, make me dote upon her; If Honourable, be thou my honor: And if I cannot know that which I would, Be pleas'd to make me know, Lord, what I should Then shall my ready lips expresse and show I know no more, then thou wouldst have me know My unty'd tongue shall evermore proclaime Th'attendant glories of thy sacred Name.
