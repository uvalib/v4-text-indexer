To Edinburgh about vj. houris at morne, As I was passand, pansand, out the way, Ane bony boy was soir makand his mone; His sory sang was oche and wallaway! That euer I sould byde to se that day! Ane King at euin, with Sceptur, Sword, &amp; Crown, At morne bot ane deformit lumpe of clay, With tratouris strang sa cruellie put downe. Than drew I neir sum tythingis for to speir, And said; âmy freind, quhat makis the sa way?â âBludie Bothwell hes brocht our King to beir, And flatter and fraude with dowbill Dalyday.â I studeit still, and nathing could I say, My mynde was full of admiratioun: âMy bony boy, tell me without delay The Kingis maneris, forme, and fassioun.â âNarratioun, shir, gif I do tell, His cruell murther ?e will call monsterous; For in meiknes he did all men excell, And vnto na man was he odious. To meit his marrow he was audatious, On sturdie steid, with craftie feat of weir; Mars fauourit him as fair Ascanius, Ãneas sone, that weill ane steid could steir. âIn deidis he soulde haue bene lyke Deiphoebus, Had fein?eit Fortoun fauourit him to Ring, Or Theseus, or gentill Julius, In gentill featis ferand for ane King: Dartis about him swyftlie could he fling, And rin ane rais and shortlie turne ane steid; Cunning of Crosbow, cutthrot, and culuering; Ane flaine lat fle with bow in tyme of neid. âIn gamis glaid he was rycht weill asswetit, Rycht featlie on the fluire alswa could dance; Bot Dalila vnto him was vanlatit, Quhilk causit him oft to be sad and pance; ?it neuer did sho se his maik in France Off royall bluid, to fang to be hir feir: Not hir fyrst spous, for all his greit puissance, In portratour and game mycht be his peir. âCunning of Clergy, of musick meruelus, The louing leid of Latine could declair; Sangis set with diuers tunis expres, With Instrument maist sweit into the eir. With hundis hunt he could baith Da and Deir; The faid also rycht feltlie could he set; Ane gay gois Halk vpone his hand to beir; Ane Falcowne fle to se he thocht delyte. âWith Romaine hand he could weill leid ane pen, And storyis wryte of auld antiquitie; Nobill him self and Nobill of Ingyne, And louit weill concord and vnitie. He swoumit in the fluidis of Poetrie, And did exerse the science liberall; The facund Phrase did vse of oratrie: His gude Ingyne was rycht celestiall. âIn pulchritude to Paris perigall, With browis brent and twinkland Cristell eine, Of face formois and vult heroycall, He mycht haue bene ane marrow to ane Quene. At ten houris on Sonday lait at euin, Quhen Dalila and Bothwell bad gudnycht, Off hir finger fals sho threw ane Ring, And said, âmy Lord, ane taikin I ?ow plycht.â âScho did depairt than with ane vntrew traine, And than in haist ane Culuering they leit crak, To teiche thair feiris to knaw the appoint tyme About the Kingis lugeing for to clap. To dance that nycht thay said sho sould not slak, With leggis lycht to hald the wedow walkane, And baid fra bed vntill sho hard the crak, Quhilk was ane signe that hir gude Lord was slane. âAnd Maddie meinis sho did in Seto? sing: Full weill was hir that day that sho was fre, And into ioy and out of tray and tene, So frely fred from all aduersitie. O Stewartis stout, ha! benedicitie! War ?e not Royis in this Regioun, And ay did vse Justice and equitie? And now ?our glas of honestie is run. âUnles ?e now sharplie shuit out ?our handis, And trewlie try the gyltie of this blude, ?e wilbe repuite Lowreis ouer all landis, And fais to Christ [that] deit on the Rude. My Lordis, thairfoir, I think for ?ow gude, The tresoun try and puneis equallie: Lat not ?our landis defylit be with blude, And gif ?e do, God shaw his Maiestie! âQuhen Dauie deit our Quene rycht potentlie Into this Realme did rais ane ryall rout, Out of this Regioun Lordis gart sho flie: Tresoun to try sho was that tyme maist stout; But sho is slak to try this tresoun out, And to him Dauy was na perigall: Dauy and his, thair state was wont shone clout: Our cumly King was of the blude royall. âFor dowbill Dauy sho did ?ow expell; Think on, thairfoir, quhill ?e haue sic ane cryme, And ?e defend the cruell Jesabell, Than Baallis Preistis will cal ?ow verray kynde. Now, euerie Dowglas of ane hartsum mynde, Think on dame Margaret sumtyme in the towre, And of ?oung Charles prudent of Ingyne: I pray God lat thame se ane ioyfull houre. âO ?e that dois profes Godis worde deuyne! Se that ?e sclander not his haly Name; Remember Jesus Judas put to pyne, For slak regaird of Godlynes and blame. God he is all that layis ane stumling stane, Quhilk may the cause be of our bretheringis fall: Restoir againe ?our foule polluted fame, Gif ?e fauoure Christ Jesus trew Gospell. âThe buik of Josua as I did reid, And thairin ane exampill did I find, How Acan tuik the excommunicat guid: All Israell war threitnit for that sin. The fauour of God be na way could he win, Quhill trewlie tryit war faultouris of the faill, Quhome Josua in flambis fell did burne, And than did ceis Godis wraith celestiall. âGif God was wraith at ane small pegrall stouth, And for ainis fault ane multitude did shoir, Gif diligence to mak the giltie couth, Or he will do to ?ow as he befoir. ?e knaw ?our cryme is wors ane greit daill moir Nor hunders twa of sicklis siluer fyne, To pull ane King fra his hie potent gloir, Quhome God did place be ordinance dewyne. âO ?e that to our Kirk hes done subscriue, Thir Ecanis try alsweill traist I may, Gif ?e do not, the tyme will cum beliue That God to ?ow will rais sum Josuay, Quhilk sall ?our bairnies gar sing wallaway, And ?e ?our selfis be put downe with shame: Remember on the vgsum latter day, Quhen ?e rewaird sall ressaif for ?oure blame. âI ken rycht weill ?e knaw ?our dewtie; Gif ?e do not purge ?ow ane and all, Than sall I wryte in prettie poetrie, In Latine leid, in style Rethoricall, Quhilk throw all Europe sall ring lyke ane bell, In the contempt of ?our malignitie: Fy! fle fra Clitemnestra fell, For sho was neuer lyke Penolopie. âWith Clitemnestra I do not fane to fletche, Quhilk slew hir spous the greit Agamemnon: Or with ony that Nynos wyfe dois matcheâ Semiramus, quha brocht hir gude Lord downe. Quha dow abstene fra litigatioun, Or from his paper hald aback the pen, Except he hait our Scottis Natioun, Or than stand vp and tratouris deidis commend? âNow all the wois that Ouid in Ibin Into his pretty lytill buik did wryte, And mony mo be to oure Scottis Quene, For sho the cause is of my wofull dyte. Sa mot hir hart be fillit full of syte, As Herois was for Leanderis deth, Hir self to slay for wo quha thocht delyte: For Henryis saik to lyke our Quene war laith. âThe doloure als that peirsit Diddis hart, Quhen King Enee from Carthage tuik the flycht, For the Quhilk cause vnto ane brand sho start, And slew hir self, quhilk was ane sory sycht. Sa mot sho die as did Creusa brychtâ The worthy wyfe of dowchtie Duik Jason, Quha brint was in ane garment wrocht be slycht Off Medea throw incantation. âHir lauchter lycht be lyke to trim Thysbie, Quhen Pyramus sho fand deid at the well; In langour lyke vnto Penolopie, For Vlyssis quha lang at Troy did dwell.

Heir followis the testament and tragedie of vmquhile King Henrie Stewart of gude memorie. I Henrie Stewart, vmquhile of Scotland King, Sum tyme in houpe with reuerence to Ring Within this Realme in dew obedience, Traisting with ane, attoure all eirdlie thing, Quha was the ruite quhair of I did spring, In honour to liue be Kyndelie allyance, Putand in hir sic faith and confidence, Ingland I left, seducit be ignorance: Scotland I socht in houpe for to get hir, Quhilk I may rew, as now is cum the chance, And vthers learne by me experience: In tyme be war fra ainis the work misset hir. Sum tyme sho thocht I was sa amiabill, Sa perfect, plesand, and sa delectabill, Lancit with luif she luid me by all wycht; Sum tyme, to shaw effectioun fauorabill, Gratifeit me with giftis honorabill, Maid me, ?e knaw, baith Lord, Duik, Erle and Knycht; Sum tyme in mynde sho praisit me sa hycht, Leifand all vther, hir bedfellow brycht Chesit me to be, and maid me ?our King: Than was I thocht happy into menis sycht, And puir anis did pryse thair Maker of mycht, That send thame ane Stewart sa Kyndelie to Ring. Thus, quhen sho had auancit me in estate, Hir for to pleis I set my haill consait, Quhilk now is cause of my rakles ruyne. Hir licherous luife, quhilk kindlit ouer hait, Cauld hes it cuild and sylit me with dissait, Plungeit my corps into this present pyne, Not onelie ?ow, Lordis, causand me to tyne, Bot als, allace! fra my trew God declyne, Quhome I imbrasit for plesoure of hir Mes: Justlie, thairfoir, I haue deseruit this fyne, Quha for hir saik denyit the God deuine, That did me bring fra plesoure to distres. Backwart fra God my Spirite fra sho wylit, Daylie with darknes my sycht sho ouersylit: My Princelie pretence began to decay; Vaine houpe in hir my ressoun exilit; My truethles toung my honoure defylit; My doing in deid sho gart me deny; Fra credite I crakit Kyndnes brak ray; No man wald trow the worde I did say; My leigis me left persauand hir Ire; Ingland I left, and help was away; God maid hir scurge to plaigue me for ay: Be war the scurge he cast not in the fyre. Thus was I than to doloure destinat, Miserabill man and Prince infortunat; Quhomlit in sorow and plungeit in cair, Sum tyme in mynde with anger agitat, Sum tyme in Spirit pansiue and fatigat, Musand the meine mycht meis hir euer mair; Sum tyme with doloure drewin in dispair, Wariand the warld, welth, and weilfair, Deid I desirid, hir falset to fle; Sum tyme in mynd thinkand the contrare, Sum vncouth vaiage I purpoisit prepare, Bot not sa vncouth as was preparit for me. Into the tyme of this my extasie, Quhen I was in this fearfull fantasie, With feinzeit fair and wylie wordis discreit Scho come to me with greit humilitie, Lamentand sair my greit calamitie, My langsum lyfe and sair tormentit Spirite, Promittand, with ane faithfull hart contreit, In tyme to cum, with reuerence me treit To my degre, in honoure, luife, and peace. Traistand into hir wylie wordis sweit My hart and lyfe into hir handis compleit I put, and past vnto the Sacrifice. Quhat sall I wryte how I was troublit thair? I wat it wald mak ony haill hairt sair For to reuolue my tristsum tragidie. How that thay bucheouris blew me in the air And stranglit me, I shame for to declair, Nouther to God nor honoure hauand Ee. I houpit weill to haue na ennymie Into this Realme; fra my natiuitie Thair was na man quhome to I did offend. Dissauit far I fand the contrarie: Off Tygeris quholpis, fosterit in tyrannie, Ane treuthles troup hes drewin me to this end. O faithles flock, denuide of godlynes! O Serpentis seid, nurisheit in wicketnes! Fostararis of falset, huirdome, and harlatrie, Mantenaris of murther, witchecraft expres, Tresoun amang ?ow dois daylie incres; Lawtie is banist, Justice, and equitie. Quhat sall I wryte of ?oure wyle vanitie? On falset is foundit ?our haill felicitie; ?our Castellis nor townis sall not ?ow defend; God hes persauit ?our infidelitie, And schortlie will plaigue ?our crewell tyrannie: Of ?our schort solace sorow salbe the end. Quhat hairt so hard for petie will not bleid? Quhat breist can beir bot man lament my deid? Quhat toung sa thrall in silence suir can rest? To se ane saule in sorow sowsit but feid, Ane saikles Lambe, ane innocent but dreid, Taine be consent of thame he luiffit best Furth of his bed, with doloure to be drest, By thrawart malice and murther manifest; Jugeit by Law, and hangit syne but dome: Sair it was to se ?oure Prince with murther prest; Sairar, I say, him, in his place possest, The deid that did; than Burrio, now Brydegrome. O wickit wemen, vennomus of nature! Serpentis of Kynde, thocht cumlie seme ?our statuire! Vnstabill ioy, full of aduersitie! In mynde malicious attoure all creatuire! Quhais malice taine for euir dois induire: Teichit be experience, sa may I testifie. ?our craftie consaitis cloikit with flatterie, And mylde meiknes sylit with subtilitie, Ar Medeais helters to bring vs in ?our net. Gude deidis of auld gois furth of memorie; The ruite of euill remaines but remedie Ay in ?oure mynde, sum vengance quhill ?e get. For Dawyis deid, in Maryis mynde sa prentit, Consauit haitrent daylie mair augmentit; Meik war hir wordis, thocht greit was hir greuance; Oft at command, to mak hir weill contentit, In pouertie and paine my self fra court absentit: Paine could not pleis hir, nor ?it obedience: Persaue of lust the malice and mischance; Quhair Venus anis gettis in hir gouernance Sic sylit subiectis felterit in hir snair, Wisdome is exilit and prudent puruoyance; Nobilnes and honour defacit be ignorance; And vertew banist, fra shame pas shed of hair. This sentence trew we may persaue in deid In sindrie authoris, quha lykis for to reid. In luiffis raige, as storyis dois reheirs, The crewell work of wretheit womanheid We may persaue in Scylla to succeid: For Minos luife, hir Father gaif na grace. Deianira hir husband Hercules, For Nessus saik, maist crewellie, allace! Brocht to mischeif, for all his vassalage. And Clytemnestra, for Egistus face, Agamemnon, the mychtie King of Greice, Hir husband, slew: so vyle was hir vsage. Off Ancus Martius we reid the greit mischance, Quha rang in Rome in proude preheminance, Slaine be Lucinio at Tanaquillis procuire: Samson also, for manheid and prudence, All Israell that had in gouernance, Dalila desauit in vnder couertoure: Quhairfoir, lat men be war, and keip thame suire Fra wemenis vennome vnder faithles figure, And gif na wyfe thair counsall for to keip: For as the woirme that workis vnder cuire At lenth the tre consumis that is duire, So wemen men, fra thay in credite creip. I speik not but pruife, quhilk I may sairlie rew: Quhat lyfe did thoill, my deid dois try it trew. My fragill fortowne sa faithles hes bene heir, Wald God the day that I thee, Scotland, knew, Atropus the threid had cut Lachesis drew. So sould not felt the change of Fortownes cheir: My Kingdome cair, my wealth was ay in weir: My state vnstabill me drew fra Godis feir: My plesoure prikis my paine ay to prouoke: My solace, sorow, sobbing to asteir; My ryches powertie, power to empire: My wratchet wyfe hes now put out the smoke. Quhat warldlie ioy in earth may lang induire? Or quhat estate may heir him self assuire For to conserue his lyfe in sicernes? Quha may sustene the perillous auentuire Off fals fortowne, inconstant and vnsuire? Or quhair sall men find steidfast Stabilnes? All warldlie blis is mixt with bitternes, Springand with ioy, endand with wretchitnes, As heir my end reheirsit dois record. Quhairfoir let Princes pryde thame not expres In warldlie welth, in pomp nor worthynes, Bot stablishe thair strenth, with Dauid, on the Lord. In earth, thairfoir, sen nocht is permanent, My soule to God I leif omnipotent; My Bab and Childe vnder the Counsallis cuire. To ?ow, my Lordis, of my deid Innocent, For to reuenge I leif in Testament My saikles bluid, my murther and iniure; Thocht Princes wald be falset ?ow alluire, Hurt not ?our honouris, the samin to smuire. First luik to God, syne to ?our libertie. Think weill: suppois my death ?e wald induire, Gif Rubbers Ring, na subiect salbe suire Mair nor the sheip in Foxis companie.

Throw the ma Kinge than ane dois ring, Throw the all Tratoure blythlie sing, Throw the is kendlit ciuill weir, Throw the murther wald beir the swing, Throw the to graif is gone my deir. Throw the is raisit sturtsum stryfe, Throw the the vitall breith of lyfe Is him bereft did with the beir, Quhen Gallow pin or cutting Knyfe Suld stranglit the, and saift my deir. Ungraitfull grome, sic recompence Was not condigne to thyne offence; With glowing gunne that man to teir From doggis deith was thy defence: To the sic mercie schew my deir. O cursit Cain! o hound of hell! O bludie bairne of Ishmaell! Gedaliah quhen thow did steir, To vicis all thow rang the bell, Throw cruell murther of my deir. Allace! my deir did not foirsie, Quhen he gaif pardone vnto the, Maist wickit wretche! to men sinceir Quhat paine he brocht and miserie, With reuthfull ruine to my deir. But trew it is, the godly men Quhilk think na harme nor falset ken, Nor haitrent dois to vthere beir, Ar sonest brocht to deithis den, As may be sene be this my deir. Thairfoir to the I say no moir, Bot I traist to the King of Gloir, That thow and thyne sall ?it reteir ?our Campe, with murning mynde richt soir, For cruell murther of my deir.

Reuenge his deith with ane assent, With ane hart, will, mynde, and Intent; In faithfull freindschip perseueir; God will ?ou fauour and thame schent, Be work or word that slew my deir. Be crous, ?e commouns! in this cace, In auenture ?e cry, allace! Quhen murtherars the swinge sall beir, And from ?our natiue land ?ow chace, Unles that ?e reuenge my deir. Lat all that fische be trapt in net, Was counsall, art, part, or reset, With thankfull mynde and hartie cheir, Or ?it with helping hand him met, Quhen he to graif did bring my deir. Defend ?our King and feir ?our God, Pray to auoyde his feirfull rod, Lest in his angrie wraith austeir ?e puneist be, baith euin and od, For not reuenging of my deir. And do not feir the number small, Thocht ?e be few, on God ?e call With faithfull hart, and mynde sinceir: He will be ay ?our brasin wall, Gif ?e with speid reuenge my deir. Remuif all sluggische slewth away; Lat lurking Inuy clene decay; Gar Commoun weill ?our Baner beir, And peace and concord it display, Quhen ?e pas to reuenge my deir. With sobbing sych I to ?ou send This my complaint, with dew commend, Desyring ?ow all without feir Me, pure Scotland, for to defend, Sen now to graif is gone my deir. Finis. V. Heir followis ane Exhortatioun to the Lordis. My Lordis, now, gif ?e be wyse, Knaw weil the grace y?

Think it is nouther strenth nor fors, That hes set ?ow a fuite befoir: Think weill that nouther men nor hors Off sic ane act sould get the gloir: Bot he that ringis euer moir Hes luikit on ?oure quarrell rycht: Gif him all thankis now thairfoir, And pryse his name with all ?our micht. I grant ?our interpryse was gude, ?our purpose worthy till allow; Bot I considder how it stude, And how the cais is cumin now. Had thay keipit thame self fra ?ow, And langer taryit in thair strenth, Thocht ?our curage was gude, I trow, ?e had ?it irkit at the lenth. Think weil thair wit was thame bereft, Quh? fulishlie thay tuik the plane; Think thay war to thair foly left, Quhen thay in feild come ?ow agane; Think weill ?e aucht for to be faine, But bluid, to win the vpper hand, Quhair nouther m? was hurt nor slane, To get the Jewell in ?our hand. Sen ?e it haue, thairof be suire, Or els ?e ar rycht far to blame; Gif ?e hir till eschaip enduire, Think ?e sall haue baith skaith &amp; shame. Quha babishlie bourdis with his dame, It war weill wairit he gat his quhippis; Think neuer agane to dwell at hame, Gif ?e lat ga that is in ?our grippis. Gif sho had not cum in the feild, For to defend the tratoure kene, And not laubourit, with speir and sheild, His wickit quarrell to sustene, ?e had done wrang, as sum men mene, Hir to withald agane hir will; Bot now, quhill trew tryall be sene, Sho moste be keipit or all will spill. Pas fordwart in ?our interpryse, Reuenge in haist the cruell act; Spair not to gif thame all ane syse, Quhome ?e beleif the King did sact. Be bauld and na way turne abak, Spair nouther midling, greit, nor small; With wysdome syne gude tryall tak, And cause sum ane confes thame all. Proclaime that all quha ocht dois knaw, To mak probatioun euident, With diligence thay cum and shaw In oppin and in place patent, That sinners shortlie may be shent And gude men fred from all defame: Sen God hes to ?ow power lent, Gif ye be lashe ye ar to blame. The heid traytoure, quhair euer he be, Gif ye haue fors, se ye persew; Thocht he fra hoill to hoill do fle, At last he can not weill eschew. Lat him be slaine your King that slew, Bring ainis his fylthie lyfe till end; Quha wickitlie this beir did brew, Wa worth the tyme that sho him kend! Syne on your self ye tak gud keip, And lat na ennimeis heir resort; Be walkryfe and fall not on sleip, Baith day &amp; nycht gar walk your port. Lat gude quarrell your hartis comfort: The wark is greit ye haue on hand; Think weill it is not play nor sport, Bot outher man ye die or stand. For Godis saik, aboue all thing, Keip clene your handis fra wr?gus geir; Gif ye wald haue his trew blissing, Schaw first that ye the Lord do feir. Exerce your selfis in gentill weir, And fle from fylthie auarice, Quhilk is, as I in Scriptuire leir, The verray ruite of euerie vice. ?our brether of the Nobill race With all meiknes desyre concur; And your querrell in this cace, Quhilk I dout not, will be ane spur, So that your pride cause thame not stur, Bot your gude gyding thame alluire: To cause thame enter, mak ane duire, Gif ye do swa, ye may be suire. Tak Godis quarrell als in hand, And purge vs from Ipocrasie, And than ye sall haue in your band The townis and communitie. Prouyde als for the Ministerie; Reforme the Justice gif ye can; Than sall tryumph your memorie Aboue all sen this Realme began. Sen Fergus first come in this land, Sic gude beginning neuer was sene, That gentilnes, at thair awin hand, Sa iust ane quarrell did sustene. Reuoltis hes bene ma nor fyftene, And Princes in strang presoun set: Quhair all from bluid was keipit clene, Skantlie can I exampill get. Think th? ?e wil performe the work That now dois your beginning blis, And thocht your ennimeis seme stark, He will cause thame thair purpose mis: That all war ane, faine wald I wis; Bot ?it thocht sum againis yow faill, This actioun haill sa honest is, With Godis grace it sall preuaill. Lat na man throuch yow harmit be, And than ye sall na hartis tyne; Gif euerie ane his awin degre; Excluid na man out of his lyne. Set all at rest, and efter syne With all the rest concur togidder, To mak ane ordour gude and fyne, As your wisdomis can best considder. Keip weil your Prince, &amp; for him pray That God indew him with his grace, That he incres may day be day, To be the best of all his race: The trew Religioun syne imbrace; Fra vice to vertew tak the traine, His pepill weill in perfyte peace, And lang in helth with thame remaine. All vitious wycht fra him exclude; Be walkryfe, wyse, and diligent: Gif ony be wald him na gude, Lat thame na way be thair present. To teich him vertew tak gude tent; Lat not his ?outheid be infectit: Greit is the gift God hes yow lent; Sair sall ye rew gif ye neglect it. And thus yow shortlie till exhort, My Lordis all, I thocht it gude; For men oftyme of meinest sort, That raknit war of ressoun rude, Seing the cais and how it stude, Hes geuin gude counsall to the wyse: So wald I now, and, to conclude, God blis you and your interpryse.

Quhohes set aboue vs for to Ring, Will quhat I am, hes tane on hand, Sa bre, rashely in thair Court to thring, By thomission lyke Johne vpaland. T?aine thair plesand flowre of Poyetrie With rurall termis, and sentences denude Of trym figuris, and painted oratrie: From airt poetick heir I it exclude, Desyrand ?our Lordshippes to be sa gude To mark the sentence rather nor the style, And take it in gude pairt, thocht it be rude: Will God the nixt sall haue ane sharper fyle. To call to mynde, I think not necessair, The warkes of God within this cuntrie shawin, Within thir seuin ?eiris or lytill mair, Sen Christis trumpet throw this l?d was blawin. Unto baith pure and riche it is weill knawin, And als ?our selfes, my Lordis, may cleirly se That God wil haue the pride of m? doune thrawin, Thocht he war neuer exalted so hie. ?it with myself considdering the estate Off ?ow, my Lord Regent, quhome God preserue! And all the rest, I thocht gude to repeate Sum thingis that to ?oure interprise mycht serue, Knawing that man is reddy for till swerue, Without continuall admonitionis be: Man of his awin nature is so proterue, Thairfoir I pray ?oure Lordshippes, beir with me. How potent was that hornit byke of hell Into this land, quhen God did ?ow vpsteir, It is weill knawin; ?e will confesse your sell ?our strength to thairis on na way mycht be peir. ?it God Almychtie did ?our baner beir, And all thair mycht and prydfull pomp ouerthrew. Because the Lord of Hostis they did not feir, Thairis did decay, and ay ?oure honour grew; Quhill that, allace! ?e begouth to neglect The gloir of God, and sa did seik ?our sell; The maist pairt, I mein, that did infect, From feruencie within proces ?e fell. Quhilk Godis seruandis from tyme to tyme did tel, And shew that God wald not sic thingis ouerse. ?e gaif deif earis, bot God did ?ow compell To find his worde effectuall to be. ?e knaw my minde; I neid not be mair plane; ?e se all warldly gloir for to be slidder: Quhen God is greuit, than he spairis nane: King, Quene, and Lord, thay pas into ane fidder. Thairfoir I warne ?ow, ane and all togidder, To put ?our stay vpone the leuing Lord, And all his warkis into this land considder, Continuing in obeying of his word. ?e doing this, ?e neid not for till feir Deu. 28.The boisting of ?our ennemeis without: The Lord will blis ?ow baith in peace and weir, Leui. 26.And all ?our enemeis rudely ruit out. ?e sall haue freindis of them that dwellis about, Jos. 24.Bot, gif that ?e grow slak or negligent, The clene contrare sall cum to pas but dout: Thairfoir, I pray ?ow, to ?our selfis tak tent.

If Momus children seek to know My name and where I dwell, I am Tom Truth, and my aboad I list not it to tell; For wise men love not to enquire Who, where, but what is said, And hold themselves therewith content Till further proof be made. THE DOUBLE DEALINGS OF THE REBELS IN SCOTLAND. If tongue coud tell or pen coud write The craftie cloaked case, Or yet the treasons to recite Of this new Regents grace, Then Tullies style, or Virgils verse, Of God sure woud I crave, His shameless acts here to rehearse, As he deserves to have. But that were far above my reach, And more than well could be; Sith he all others doth excell In craft and crueltie. Yet can I not with silence pass His vices strange and rare, But that I must sett forth the same, The truth least I should spare. And now, since that it is my luck, Unfittest tho I be, This Cacos offspring to advance, As seems, to his degree, I pray you, take it in good part Whats'ever I shall say, In setting forth his shameless acts Whose shame shall not decay. Yet can I not sett furth the same, Nor in such wise express, As fittest were for one past shame, And past all godliness. This traytor tyrant of our time, This Satans seed, I mean This rebel regent that his prince To mate doth not disdain; This perfect pattern of deceipt, Whose high and haughty mind Is pufft so full of pride, that hard It were the like to find; This sinfull seed of loathsome love, This bastard past all grace, At Glocester that traytor vile A perfect pattern chase. Who, to obtain the kingly seat Of this most worthy land, His brothers sonsâhis nephews dearâ To guide he took in hand; The Lambs, alass! unto the wolf To guide committed were, Who murderd them to have their place, As storys well declare. But shall I say this traitor now At him did learn his lore, Who doth surpass his wilie wit A thousand fold and more? A scholar, sure, of pregnant wit, And apt for such a place, Who trained up was in the school Of lying Satans grace; Where he hath learnd a finer feat Than Richard earst did see, To do the deed, and lay the blame On those that blameless be. For he and his companions eke, Agreeing all in one, Did kill the King, and lay the blame The sakeless Queen upon; And, that this deed in each mans sight Might seem to be most plain, They drew her from her spouse that night, By craft and subtile train; And feigned that her sucking son Was in great danger brought, Wherefore with speed to visit him The messenger besought. Which subtile shift, so feately wrought, Was cause men thought it true, That she of purpose parted hence, And of the murder knew. For if that both at once had been There murderd at that time, Then might each babe with half an eye Have spyed who did the crime. And, this suspicion to encrease, They found a new devise, That Bothwel, cheifest murderer, Was tryed by assi?e, And found not guilty by his peers, Of whom the cheifest be Such as the Kings death did conspire, And knew as well as he. They cleard him eke by Parliament, O traytors false and vile! That they their good and vertuous Queen Might sooner so beguile. And when that he was cleared both By size and parliament, To marry then they went about To have her to consent, And said that she, the realme, and they Should so most safest be From danger of all civil strife, And outward enemy. Alack! good Queen! what hap hadst thou So oft thy foes to trust? Coudst thou not shun those biting beasts Whom thou hadst tryd unjust? But who, I pray you, was the man They willed her to take? Forsooth, the cheifest murderer Whom they most clear did make; And that their purpose, once begun, Might come unto an end, They caused traitor Lethington On her still to attend, That this false Machivilian Might tempt her evry day, Whose poysond words so sugard were That she coud not say nay, But did consent to their request, Suspecting nothing less Than they such false deceipt to mean, And use such doubleness. But, when the woefull wedding day Was finished and past, Their boiling malice that lay hid In rageing sort outbrast. For they, that were of council both To murdring of the King, And to the marriage, gan to spread How Bothwel did the thing; And how he took away the Queen By force against her will, And sought himself to reigne as King, And eke the prince to spill. But, bastard! now the truth is known, How that thy self it was That thought to spill both prince and Queen, And to possess their place. But when among the simple sort This rumour once was brought, It ran abroad from place to place More swift than can be thought. So they, not privy to the sleight, Did think it for most sure, That she to wed the murderer The murther did procure. And thus this simple Queen each way Was wrapt in woe and care, For they that have not skill of craft Are soonest caught in snare. And then the traitor Ledingtone, In treason never slack, At hand, like pickpurse still before, Began to start now back, And fled unto her faithless ffoes Her secrets to betray: âLike will to like,â the proverb sais: You know the old said sa. Then Murray, that of long before This murder did devise, Did void the land, the rather so To blind the simples eyes. And then his fellow traitors all, The more their cause to clear, Did rise in arms against their Queen, As though she guilty were. But she, to save the sakeless blood, Not willing to offend, Did leave her power and offerd them All things amiss to mend. The traitors, not therewith content, Did lead her home away, And changed all her brave attire Into a ffrock of grey. That done, they lead her forth by night Unto Lochlevin hold, And kept her here in prison close That no man see her could; And when they had thus brought to pass Their traiterous, false desire, They send with speed to bastard James, And willd him to retire. Who, coming home for love he bare The Prince, as he did say, Did take in hand to rule the realm, Lest it fell in decay. How well this traytor loves this child, Committed to his gaurd, Is plain in that the mother dear He kept in cruel ward, And caused her there, by forced fact, The present death to shun, Her Royal crown for to resign Unto her tender son, And make this minion Murray eik Cheif Regent of the land, Untill the Prince, of lawfull age, The same shall take in hand. Which while he woud, as Richard did, If he might have his will, His nephew young, his sister's son, By secret means to spill, And then he woud usurp the crown, As next heir to the same, Which does appear in that he doth His ffather so defame; And saieth his mother precontract Was in most solemn wise Unto the King, before that he Was married to the Guise; Although that wise men know the truth This sorceress how she wrought By rings and witchcraft from the Queen The Kings mind to have brought; And thus this traytor doth debase The Queen in all he can, That from her grace withdraw he might The hearts of every man. A cowle, a cowle for such a Greek Were fitter for to wear, Than this Apostate deacon shoud Such princely rule to bear! But where is now true discipline? Dare no man take on hand To teach such false Apostate monks Their faults to understand? And make this base born Deacon come Home to his former state, From whence the Lither Lozell fled Lest he shoud live too straight? But, sure, no marvel tho Gods rodd Hath plagued this noble dame, That gave to monks shoud serve in church Such place of worldly fame. Yet he, not all unmindfull of This Ladies gratefull deed, Did purpose with a cruel death To quick her for her need. But God Almighty, in whose hands The hearts of princes be, Preservd her from these false attempts, And vile captivity. And when this noble prey was past This brothers bloody might, He raged like a tyger fell Ffor sorrow and for spite. So seeing that he coud not then His noble Queen to spill, Upon her faithfull subjects he Began to work his will. Ffor some he cast in prison deepâ No cause at all theretoâ And some he thurst out of the realm, To work them greater woe. And some he put to cruel death His rage for to fulfill: No means he unattempted left Her subjects lives to spill. Yet, not content in this great rage On men to play his part, In spight of God, against his Christ He gan to shew his art, And pulled thence both bells and lead, With jewels many one, That he and his companions might More braver therein gone. Ffor sure I am that some of them, Amongst this traiterous train, Have on their back more lead at once Than covereth churches twain; So that no hardend heart of brass But woud lament right sore To see prophaning of each place As served God in yore. And, when he had this sacriledge Committed every where, On lofty towers and castles strong His rage did then appear. On Dunbar first he spued his spightâ A castle fair and strong; And there he wrought both day and night Till it was laid along; Then hasteth furth, and Lochnivar So seemly to the viewâ He spoiled them first and sackd them then: Who coud more cruel do? The Laird of Skirlings house likewise Did feel the former chance, Which traiterously he did deface, His glory to advance. Then Rosslin Bower, of brave attire, Which Sinclair doth possess, Most shamefully he ransackt so To work him more distress. Lord Herris landsâthat Baron bold Who let him of his will, When he was gone throughout the same, He did both robb and spill. But what shoud I here longer stay Each place here to recite, Since few there are but that his rage Hath now defaced quite? When he had wrought his wicked will And had his false intent, To blind the eyes of simple men He calld a parliament, Where flockd his fellow traytors all, Both Morton and M'Gill, With Lindsay, Mar, and Lethingtone, Yea, Balfour lay not still, With others of this fruitless flock, And falsely did invent That all things here concluded were By full and whole consent. Thus sinfull Satan workd his will, Through these his children dear, That falsehood reigns instead of right, As here it doth appear. Yet have they not so slilely wrought, Tho Satan was their guide, But that their treason evry deal At last is well espyd. For they, to seem more innocent Of this most heinous deed, Did catch four of the murderers, And put to death with speed; Whereby they hopd to make men think Therein that they were clear, Sith justice they did execute On some that guilty were: As Hepburn, Dalgleish, Powrie too; John Hay made up the mass; Which four, when they were put to death, The treason did confess, And said that Murray, Morton too, With others of their rout, Were guilty of the murder vile, Tho now they look full stout. Yet some perchance do think that I Speak for affection here, Tho I woud so, three thousand can Herein true witness bear, Who present were, as well as I, At the execution time; And heard how these, in conscience prickd, Confessd who did the crime. Therefore, all princes, take good head Let this for warning stand; And try before you trust, I warn, Lest check be near at hand. But though this check it seems so sure That mate is now at hand, Yet may his Queen such guard procure As shall his force withstand; And then she may, as he began, Bid check and mate with thee, And warn him, since his force is done, To yeild or else to flee: To yeild, I mean, from false attempt, And fly such vain request, And guard himself with reasons rule, And set his heart at rest, And spend no more his time in vain Such false attempts to try, Lest, if they use them over oft, He'l climb, I fear, to high. And thus I cease, and make an end, And wish him to beware No more such checks and taunts to give, Lest he be caught in snare. Finis q? Tom Trowth. XLVI.

Sen drunkardis, gluttonis, and contentious men, Shedderis of blude, and subiectis gevin to greid, May no? posses the hevinly gloir, ?e ken, As in the bybill dalie do we reid; Lat thir be wyit allyk till every leid, Syne fornicatioun plasit amangis the laif: Exemp ?our self throw all the toun in deid, Than luke how mony ?e onmerkit haif.

On causs thair is thay can no? be convict; ?e had na power fra the sone wes sett; The provest gaif na power to Gilbert Dick, The speciall thing that sowld no? bene for?ett; Thay war nocht theivis, nor ?it condempt in dett, Nor ridhand tane, quhilk was na causs, ?e knaw; Bot ?e latt rukis and ravynis rin throw the nett, And saikles dowis makis subiect to Ã¾e law. ?our parciall Juge, we may declyne him, to; Bot sett me doun the persone Pennycuke; Or Sanderis Guthrie, lat see quhat he can do: He k?nis the caice, and keipis ?our awin court buke.

As for his wyf, I wald ?e sowld forbid hir Hir eyndling toyis: I trow thair be no denger, Becauss his lome is larbour grown and lidder, But vndirstanding now to treit ane strenger.

Ane Tragedie, in forme of ane Diallog betwix Honour, Gude Fame, and the Authour heirof in a Trance. In Januar the thre and twentie day, Befoir midnycht, in Lythquo as I lay, Tumbling sum tyme on bed abon the clais, Now heir, now thair, quhylis doun, quhylis up I rais; Till at the last, in tuinkling of ane Ee, Schir Morpheus the Mair assail?eit me, With all his sluggische Suldarts out of number, Quhilk led me Captiue vnto Maister Slumber, Quha softly said: âGar keip this pure Catiue, And tak from him his speiche and wittis fiue.â Than come Dame Dreming, all clad in blak Sabill, With Sweyning Nymphis in cullouris variabill; Amangis the quhilkis, befoir me thair appeiris Ane woundit man, of aucht and threttie ?eiris, Paill of the face, baith blaiknit, blude and ble, Deid eyit, dram lyke, disfigurat was he; Nakit and bair, schot throw pudding and panche, Abone the Nauil, and out abone the hanche. Na word he said, quhairthrow I did misknaw him, Because in sic ane stait I neuer saw him. I wes agast, and sa begouth to feir Bot suddanly with him thair did appeir Twa graif lyke persounis of greit maiestie, And with gude countenance thay said to me: âWe ar cum heir to the, o wofull wycht! To cause the write that thing thou seis this nycht; For we ar knit, in band maryit togidder, And to this woundit wycht father and mother; We him begat within thir twentie ?eiris, Thocht deid lyke now he so to the appeiris; We brocht him vp, as our deir Sone and air, And he to serue vs na traueil did spair: Thocht Atropus hes maid his Corps decay, ?it Immortall in heuin his corps dois stay, And, als Immortall, he sall with vs rest, And we with him, sa lang as warld may lest.â âGude Schir,â quod I, âand ?e also, Madame, Be not offendit that I speir ?our Name, How thay call ?ow, that talkis sa hamely with me, And quhat is he that first appeirit vnto meâ That woundit man, quhome ?e do call ?our chylde? Quhat is ?our Names, lat se how ar ?e stylde?â Quod thay: âMy Sone, of that we think na schame; Honour I am, heir with my Spous, Gude Fame: This woundit chylde of ouris thow may lament, He was thy Maister ainis, and ?our Regent.â âMy Maister ainis!â quod I, â?it is he so.â âNay, nay,â quod thay, âhe is with vs ago; We haif him taine out of that wickit lyfe, And red him of all miserie and stryfe; Because ?e wordlingis ar ane Cursit Clan: ?e war not worthie of this godly man.â âAllace!â quod I, âdeid lyke he dois appeir.â âBe still,â quod thay, âand to our sayingis heir: Speid, speid, go to: tak pen, Ink, paper and wryte As we, Honour and Gude Fame, sall Indyte. âFirst thow sall wit, he was sone natural To James the Fyft, ?our King and Prince Royal; Thocht, beand ?oung, to Kirkis he was promotit, ?it we his hart with Martiall deidis dotit; For than the Lord sa blissit his affairis, That furth of Fyfe he chaist his aduersairis, With help of gentill men and subiectis to him, The quhilkis war willing all seruice to do him: Thair we begat him, and maid him our awin, As he is, was, and sa sall euer be knawin. âSyne, efter that, he passit into France, Quhair he did vs, and we did him auance: Than, hauing leirnit thair sum Frenche langage, He brocht agane with vs his pucelage. âNow, to be schort, it war lang to discerne The godly giftis that this our Sone did lerne; For as in age he daily did Incres, In vertew sa grew he and lawlynes: First he did leirne to lufe God abone all, And syne his Nichtbour with lufe mutuall: Trew Faith he leirnit of gude Abraham, With hoip and cheritie knit to the same: He leirnit als of Salomon the wisdome, How with the feir of God to reule ane Kingdome: Of strang Sampsone he had also the fors For to resist Gods foes on fute and hors; Thocht thir tratours, that drest him in this cace, Durst not present thair force befoir his face: He had lykewyse the Justice of Iethro, And als the Chastitie of Scipio: He had of Dauid the beningnitie, And of Titus the liberalitie. Quhat wald thou moir? To tell of all his vertus, For commoun welthis he did excell Camillus: Quhen pleisit God to send ?ow Scottis ye treuth, The same to further at Leith he was not sleuth; Reforming first his awin with diligence, In euerie quarter quhair he had puissence; Than was he stylit Lord James at that tyde, To quhome ?our Lordis gaif sum reule and gyde. âSone efter that, ?our Quene ane wedow was, The quhilk to bring in Scotland he did pas; In France he went, and brocht that Lady hame Quha efterwart agane changit his name; Bot ?it we maryit him, quhen we thocht gude, Unto ane Lady of hie kyn and blude: Than did ?our Quene make him baith Erle and lord Of Murray land, to quhilk we did accord; Sa condiscendit all ?our Lordis togidder, That, nixt ?our Quene, he suld reule abone vther. Bot than, allace, he did sum thing without vs, Howbeit that all his lyfetyme he did dout vs: He did permit ?our Quene to haif ane Mes, Throw quhilk at l?th scho grew in greit proudnes; Sa did the Papistis all, athort this land, Aganis the Lord his will, law, and command, That ?e almaist amangis ?ow wer deuydit, Wer not be him all wes the better gydit. âSa lang in Court as our Sone had the steir, And that ?our Quene wald his gude counsail heir, Sa lang all thing ?eid weill and wes weill drest, In quyetnes, peace, policie, and rest: Nane durst rebell on ather syde of Forth, Ouir all this cuntrie, Eist, West, South and North. The hiest of thame all he maid full law, That did rebell aganis Justice and Law. Than did ?our Quene sum tyme with vs abyde; In France, and Scotland baith, we did her gyde. Bot at the last, in hir tranquillitie, Scho did vs all abandoun wantounlie, And turnit day in nycht, and nycht in day, All the nycht lang to sport, sing, dance and play; Till at the last, baith Cupido and Venus Furth of ye Court gart baneis, chais, and stane vs. Than come dishonour and Infame, our fais, And brocht in ane to reule with raggit clais: Thocht he wes blak and Moriane of hew, In credite sone and gorgius clais he grew: Thocht he wes forraine, and borne in Piemont, ?it did he Lords of ancient blude surmont: He wes to hir baith secreit, trew, and traist, With her estemit mair nor all the raist. In yis mene tyme, cam hame yan my lord Darlie, Of quhais rair bewtie scho did sumpart farlie, The fairest sycht, scho thocht, that euir scho saw; Hir bewtie als did him in hir snair draw. For, to be schort, thay lufit sa togidder, That thay culd not be hour of day but vther. At last scho said, and caist in to hir mynde, âQuhat, quhat, sall I be thus with Cupide pynde? That will I not, bot go to my purpois; ?it first I will my mynde to sum disclois:â Than with gude vult, and visage meik and mylde, âBrother,â (quod scho) scho said vnto our Chylde: âWill not ?e weill that I marie ane man, Baith of our Surname, kynreid, blude, and clan? Lo! this is he standing befoir ?our face, Lustie, gude lyke, and cum of Royall race; Him will I marie and nane vther wycht, Witnes heirof, to him my treuth I plycht In ?our presence, desyring ?ow lykewyse That ?e be witnes to this Interpryse.â âQuhat wald thow mair? without all friends c?sent, This Lord scho maryit quhen they wer absent, Quha was bot ?oung, and culd not reull the Ring, And thay disperst that suld haif done sic thing.

It wald be lang on this mater to stand, Our Sone thay chaist syne efter in Ingland With sindrie vther Lordis that went vnto him, The quhilkis wer all of ane opinioun with him. Be this Dauid ?our Lordis did this sustene; Be him ?our King was lychtlyit with ?our Quene; Be him all thing was reulit in the Court; For him cum all this cummer, stryfe and stourt; Throw him, in him, be him, ?our Court was gydit, Quhill that ?our King and Lordis culd not abyde it; The quhilkis schortly in co?sall did c?fidder, And with ane mynde thay did consent togidder Dauid to slay, quhair euer thay mycht haif him. Concluding thus, on nycht thay did persaue him, At supper tyme, quhair he was in hir Chalmer; Than come ?our king and sum Lords with ane glamer, And reft him from hir in spyte of his nois, Syne schot him furth quicklie amang his fois, Quha stickit him, withouttin proces moir; Bot all this mischeif come sensyne thairfoir. Howbeit scho was sone closit vp beliue, Hir Gairdis defendit and hir self Captiue; ?it culd scho not in hart sic thing for?et, Bot baid her tyme, quhill scho hir tyme mycht get. âThan come thir Lords, the nixt morne efter, hame, And maist humblie our Sone halsit that Dame, Quha was with Chylde &amp; neir sax monethis gone, And him forgaif, and maid to him hir mone, Sayand: âBrother, allace, had ?e bene heir, I had not cum in all this sturt and steir; My Secretar is slane in my presence, Oh, oh, brother, allace, quhat greit offence!â âMadame,â quod he, âcair not, that is small tynsall; He wes our fo, and gaif ?our grace euill co?sall.â âWeill, weill,â quod scho, âat leist, brother, lat se Gif ?e can set me at full libertie; For I am keipit as in Presoun heir, And na servand of myne dar cum me neir.â âWith hir fair wordis, he sat hir clene at fredome, By our aduyse, quhilk was bot lytill wysdome; For to Dunbar that nycht scho raid in haist Behind ane man in poist, as scho war chaist. Thair come till her anew of men fra hand, Quhilks chaist ?our Lords sone efter in Ingland, Quhair thay remanit baneist and absent, Quhill France and Ingland maid thappoyntment. This, quhen we thocht ilk thing wes weill aggreit, ?it wes ?our Quenis hart na wayis satisfeit, Bot with Bothwell scho maid conspiracie, Seikand the way to cause hir husband die. Heir we lat pas greit tressounis thay committit, Quhilks, for schortnes of tyme, we haif omittit. Bot of ?our King, schortly for to declair, Bothwell with pulder blew him in the air At hir requeist, quhilk is ane thing weill knawin, As sen syne tauld sum seruands of thair awin; The quhilk Bothwell, for all his fylthie body, Maryit he was vnto ane Nobill Lady; Bot ?it ?our Quene, be wrang law falslie forsit, Maid him and hir from vther be devorsit. âThan went our Sone schortly in France agane, Quhair that we thre togidder did remane. Sa, in our absence, maryit scho Bothwell, Quha did hir husband kill, as thow hard tell. Of this ?our Nobills culd not be content; With burghis and C?mounis fordwarts furth thay w?t, Quhair thay met vther vpon Carberrie hil; Tuke hir; he fled, and na blude thay did spill. Than in Lochleuin scho wes put as in waird, Thocht efterwart scho had ane sleuthfull gaird. ?it did ?our Lords auyse thame of ane thing, To crowne hir Sone ?our Prince and mak him King; Quhilk act thay did, with his Motheris consent, Confirmit be the Lords in Parliament; And than, because he wes ouer ?oung to gouerne, Amangis thame selfis wyslie thay did discerne, For to elect our Sone, in his absence, Regent to be vnto ?our ?oungly Prence: Than did ?our Lords send for him to cum hame; With him come we, baith Honour and Gude Fame. All burghs and c?mounis, halelie did yai loif him, Bot sindrie said, that thay wald haif nane of him: Sa gydit he, ane quhyle, with pacience, Quhill he mycht to his fais mak resistence. Bot at the last ?our Quene wes lattin furth, Conuoyit away be sum wes lytill gude worth; And spedelie to Hammiltoun scho went, Quhair scho fand men anew Incontinent, The quhilks dispysit vs, Honour and Fame, Thairfoir all turnit to thair vtter schame. Our sone and we wer than in Glasgow towne; To hald the airis in thay parts he was bowne: Than come scho fordwart, with hir strenth &amp; fors, Ma than seuin thowsand, quhat on fute and hors; ?ea, twa for ane, we think thay wer agane vs: The towne to leaue, yai thocht than to c?strane vs: Bot we the Langsyde hill befoir thame wan, And, be Gods grace, disconfeist thame: ilk man We tuke and slew; Scho fled into Ingland, Quhair scho is ?it, not at hir awin command. Our sone cryit out, âLat na mair blude be sched, Bot tak and saif the rest that now be fled.â In deid, yat day, yair wes slane, in yat place, Ma Hammiltounis nor ony vther race. Howbeit the rest of thame, maist gratiouslie, He did intreit with pardoun and mercie: Thay him rewardit with Ingratitude, And traterously this nycht hes sched his blude. âEfter this feild our Sone in Ingland went: We left him not, bot wes with him present. Than did sum Lords lyft vp yair hornis on hie, Quhilks did withstand ?our Kingis authoritie; Bot he come hame agane or euer thay wist, And ?air Rebellioun schortly did resist. Sone efter him did cum hame my Lord Duke; For Ciuil weir yan euerie man did luke. Bot God the Lord brocht all sa weill to pas, That, without blude, all weill aggreit was; Except my Lords the Duke and Hereis baith Wer put in waird, yair wes na vther skaith; Quhair thay ar ?it, vnto yis tyme and tyde, And will be thair quhill sum men get ye gyde. âSone efter this to Liddisdaill he went, Quhairof the theifis, and sic, war not content; For to thair Chyftanis he maid biggingis bair, As efterwart thay did repent full sair. Than come he north schortly, he tuke na rest, Till all that countrie had componit and drest. The hiest of thame all, that wald Rebell, He maid him stoup and als to knaw himsell. This being done, amang all vther thing, He maid thame all subscriue vnto the King, Baith far and neir, of hie and law degree, Acknawledgeing the Kingis authoritie. Except Lord Fleming, nane war in this land, Bot to the Kingis grace had thay geuin thair band. âSa hauing stablischt all thing in this sort, To Liddisdaill agane he did resort; Throw Ewisdaill, Esdaill and all the Daills raid he, And also lay thre nychtis in Cannabie, Quhair na Prince lay thir hundreth ?eiris befoir: Na theif durst steir, thay did him feir so soir. And that thay suld na mair thair thift alledge, Thre scoir and twelf he brocht of thame in pledge, Syne wardit yam, quhilk maid ye rest keip ordour; Than mycht the Rasche bus keip ky on ye bordour. âQuhen he this thocht till haif bene at his eais, In come on him the Quene of Inglandis fais, The quhilks to seik he tuke purpois fra hand; Without delay he gat Northumberland; He socht him so, and fand him at the last, And pat him in Lochleuin, quhair he is fast. âThan went he suddanly to Dunbartane, In snaw, sleit, drift, wind, froist, hailstanis &amp; rane. In deid, lyke snaw, thair words wer soft and fair, Lyke sleit, quhylis scharp, with promysis maist bair; Lyke drift also thay did driue of the tyme, Til ane fals tratour suld commit this cryme. Lyke as the froist dois freis vp all fresche watter, Thay freisit him in Stirling on this mater. Windie it was, and windie was the sessoun; As is ye Fr?che Prouerb, âgrand vant, gr?d tressoun.â With scharp hailstanis thay schot him traterouslie; Lyke rane in greit wind, syne fled suddanlie: Sa may we weill the tyme to deid compair, For all wes trublit, baith se, land, and air. âOn Sonday than, the quhilk wes ?isterday, Vnto this towne he come, soupit, and lay, Dynit this day, and, just at aleuin houris, Thair wes ane knaif of his Conspiratourisâ Ane Hammiltoun, within the bischoppis stair, Quhilk schot him, as thow seis, withouttin mair; Syne at the bak ?et suddanlie he fled; Sum saw him weill, and followit his hors tred; Quhilk hors was knawin bel?ging to Lord Johne, Quha with the rest this act maid to be done. Bot to our Sone we keipit cumpanie, Quhilk in our armes within this hour did die. Than deit with him all vertus Cardinall, Than deit with him Justice Imperiall: For in his tyme Gods word was trewly preichit, And in his tyme Collegis rychtlie teichit. Not only lufit he vprychteousnes, Bot als he hatit vice and vitiousnes: Not only did he lufe God, and him ken, Bot als he hatit all vngodly men. To sessioun als, ilk day he went to se Gif Justice wes thair Ministrate trewlie. The riche and pure, he did alyke regaird, Puneist the euill and did the gude rewaird. He wald not lat the Papists cause ga bak, Gif it wer Just, bot wald be for him frak: He wald not thoill the proud oppres the pure, Sa far as he had regiment and cure: He did disdane pryde and ambitioun: He lufit men meik of Conditioun: He did disdane all foull and fylthie word, In ony sort, outher in eirnist or bourd: Maist diligent he wes to ryn athort To gif the wedow and fatherles confort: Maist diligent to heir the pure m?nis bill, And gif answer according to Gods will. Sober he wes in meit, in drink, and claithis, He wald not thoill blaspheming, nor na aithis; Reddy to heir quhen ony man spak to him, Mistraisting not yat ony wald vndo him. Peace and concord ouer all for to mantene: The pure durst leif yair bestiall on the grene. For slauchter mercy wald he neuer grant; Baith murtheraris, theifis, and Witches he did dant. For to be schort, lay all ?our heidis togidder, Gif ?e can find amang ?ow sic ane vther.â âGet vp,â quod thay, âit is almaist midnycht;â With yat, all thre, thay went out of my sycht. Because ane man wes knoking at the ?et, Quhair I did ly, and had myself for?et, Sa rais I vp, all clad in bute and spur: âQuhais yat,â quod I, âyat knokis at the dur?â âI, ?our gude freind and nychtbour,â answerit he; âGar oppin the ?et, gude brother, now lat se.â âBrother,â quod I, âhow dois my Lord, I pray ?ow?â âDepartit, oh!â quod he, âand deid, I say ?ow.â âAllace!â quod I, âI find my Dreme ouer trew, And that, full sair, all Scotland sone will rew.â Than to the palice went I and ?eid in; Thair weiping vocis hard I making din. Within the chalmer I went quhair he departit, Quhilk sycht to se, God wait, maid me sair hartit. Than come I furthe agane, and saw my Lady, Quhais horsis at the foir ?et wer alreddy. To Edinburgh scho went with hart full soir. Reuenge his deith, ?e Lords! I say na moir. Epitaphe. Heir lyis the Corps, gude pepill, of a Prince, Quhois Saule in heuin with God is glorifeit: James Regent was murdreist without offence Be ane false tratour, sa knawin and notifeit, XIII. The Deploratioun of the Cruell Murther of Iames Erle of Murray, vmquhile Regent of Scotland, togidder with ane admonitioun to the Hammiltounis committaris thairof, and to all thair Fortifearis, Mantenaris, or assistance, with ane Exhortatioun to the Lordis and Nobilitie, keiparis and defendaris of our Kingis Grace Maiestie. Quhile as with flesche and blude we go about, The wondrous warkis of God for to discriue, Pans quhil we pleis, we sal not find yame out, Bot sall Judge God aganis all ressoun striue, Quhen as he tholis proude Pelours to depriue The lyuis from sic as halelie wes his, Be cruell murther thame reuthles for to riue? The flesche of man can neuer considder this. Bot quha that wald the mater vnderstand, He man luke lawer, and enter in the Spreit, And than he sall persaif the cause fra hand, That God wirks na thing bot as a Judge discreit. Quhen as the pepill with sinnis ar repleit Without remors, as thay ar at thir houris, Than, to that end his plages he may compleit, He takis from thame thair godly Gouernouris. And this he vsis mony sindrie sortis, Sumtyme be seiknes in to thair beddis to de, Sum slaine by tratouris bot not for thair confortis, Bot to that end thay suld distroyit be, And rutit furth clene out of memorie. He tholis sic wickit, proude Conspiratouris To execute thair lurking traytorie, And bring to deith thair godly Gouernouris. 1. Jo. 3.We se also the wickit of the warld Still beir the godly at deidly Indignatioun; Sum tyme be tratouris ar Innocentis ouerharld, And, thocht trew men, haif heir bot tribulatioun. We suld not haif sic thingis in admiratioun, As gif it wer ane new thing chansit of man, For sa it wes euin from the first Creatioun, And still hes bene sen that this warld began. This mortall feid, this haitrent and Inuie, Did first begin, as Gods awin buke dois tell, Gen. 4.As in the Genesis we may plainly spie, Betuix twa brether, Cain and Abell. Cain aganis his brother did Rebell, And susseit not to sched his saikles blude; And for this cause, I pray ?ow mark it well, His warkis war euill, and faithfull Abells gude. And of thir twa this haill warld did discend, Quhilk neuer can amangis thame selfis aggrie, Bot baith thair Ofspringis may be cleirly kend, Curst Cains Clan be thair Impietie, And Abells seid for richt and equitie. And thus all murtherars ar discendit doun Of curst Cain and his posteritie, As is the tyrane and tratour Hammiltoun. For, luke how Justice was the verray cause To curst Cain his brother for to kill; Sa is it ?it, but dout, th[e] only clause That moues the wickit vnto thair Raging still. Thay gloir na thing, bot euer in to Ill, And makis thame euer but mercy to maligne; And, quhen thay may thair wickit wayis fulfill, Thay will not thole ane godly man to Rigne. The Probatioun heirof. To preif this part I plainly mycht propone Exemples seir, maist Notabill and trew; Bot for thame all I will bot vse heir one Of our deir Maister and Sauiour, Christ Jesew, In quhome na spot of sin it neuer grew, ?it nocht theles the Bischoppis micht not byde him, Quhill on a Croce on lenth and breid him drew, And hangit vp for spyte twa theuis besyde him. For to mak mentioun of the marterdome Of Gods Prophets, it wer sum thing to lang; And for to reckin the reuthles Rage of Rome, Quhair sindrie godly thay dulefully doun dang, It were prolixt; thairfoir I let thir gang, And to my purpois, but proces mair, proceid, How wickit men delytis ay in to wrang, And may not suffer to haif ane godly heid. Sen sa it wes that Christ, baith God and man, With his Apostills and Prophets gat na rest, Bot euer hatit be Cain and his clan, As Gods trew word dois mak it manifest, We suld not grudge howbeit we be opprest, As wes our Maister and brethrene vs beforne, Bot be assurit it will cum for the best, And better to thame that thay had neuer bene borne. I mene not heir that thay suld pas vnpunissit For thair trespas, nor neuer sic thing thocht: For than suld Justice and lufe be clene diminissit, Gif thay war spairit this wickit wark hes wrocht, That our gude gyde to bailfull beir hes brocht. Lat vs assemble thairfoir with curage stout, And lat thay tratouris out throw this land be socht, And neuer leif thame till thay be ruitit out. Ane Admonitioun to all the Hammilto?is and thair assistaris, counsallaris, and pertakeris of this maist vile and abhominabill Murther. O Teinfull tratouris! quhy did ?e him deuoir Maist schamefullie, that puneist euerie vice, Quha wes the cheif mantenar of Gods gloir In to this Realme, and lufit all Justice? ?our bailfull blude can neuer pay the price Of his deir deith, wrocht be ?our wickitnes, Wa worth ?ow Uillanis that slew that Prince maist wise For na cause ellis bot for his rychteousnes! For sen ?e first in to this Realme began, ?e wer ay callit for ?our tyrannie Strypis of the Schyre, the maist vnworthie clan That euer wes bred, or sene in this countrie, As schawis weill be ?our Genalogie: For thift and murther, reif and oppressiounis, With Guldis and Rukis blasit equallie, Is the auld armes of the Hammiltounis. And quha wald seik ane man but conscience, Ane Renegat for to deny his Creid, To tak ane pure man vnder his credence, Syne cut his throt and toung out of his heid; To put ane hundreth for to beg thair breid, And bring Just men vnto confusioun; To do ane horrible and ane vnworthie deid? Seik neuer farther than ane Hammiltoun. Ane midding tuil?our but manheid at assay; Ane vail?eand tyrane, ane febill Campioun, Ane wyfe with Childe that manfully can slay; Ane noysum nychtbour proude in oppressioun; Ane teinfull tratour of rycht successioun, To Crucifie Christ that compts not a feg; I say to ?ow for schort conclusioun: Come neuer a gude byrde of the Deuillis eg. How horriblie ?e spul?eit vnder nycht In his awin hous, maist schamefull for till heir, Ane Nobill Lord, James, of Torphichen Knycht, He can declair gif ony man lyst speir. ?e left him nocht ane Mal?e nor Deneir, Syne, vnder truste, neir schot him and his wyfe, And Tymothie wes in ane felloun feir, Bot, prasit be God, they chaipit with thair lyfe. Our Kingis Gr?dschir at Lighquo feild ?e slew; Baneist his Gudschir from his kynde heritage; His Fatheris murther also ?e cleirly knew, Myschantly hangit, ane wickit vassalage. Thir are ?our warks euin fra ?our first barnage, God wait gif ?e be Jaips to hald in stoir, Or bony byrdis to keip in to ane Cage: Christ keip our King out of ?our handis heirfoir! ?e slew our Regent because his warks wer gude, Quha wes the Lampe of lycht in to this land: As houngrie tykis ?e thristit for his blude, Nu. 35.That sauit ?ow quhen ?e wer in his hand, Gal. 5.Quhen ?e culd not resist his forcie wand; Joa. 3.Ane suithfast sentence heirfoir I sall ?ow tell, Gen. 9.Pronuncit be God, I lat ?ou vnderstand: Apo. 23.All Murtherars thay sall Inhereit hell. Ane admonitioun to the assistaris, counsallaris, by lyaris, and Reioysaris in this maist detestabill murther. Nocht only thay, bot all that sic assistis, Or fortefeis, or ony wayis manteins, Incurris his Curse: now luke Gods buik quha listis, For it is not mans Judgement sa yat deims. And quha that this seir sentence small esteims, The tyme sall cum that he sall weip and murne, Quhen hiddeous Hell, with greuous glow?d gleims, Baith body and Saule for euer mair sall burne. Moirouer, all thay of that Genalogie, And of that Surname, we mak thame Intimatioun, Thay salbe repute of this foule cryme gyltie, Quha nocht compeiris to mak Purgatioun; Farther, all thay geuis consultatioun, Or thame assistis in to this fylthie fact, And not compeiris to our Conuentioun: Thay salbe haldin pertakeris of this act. Be war, heirfoir, and be effrayit of this: Lat sic tryit tratouris defend thair awin curst cause; Tyne not ?our landis and als the heuinis blis, Bot be obeysant to God and mans Lawis; And be not flatterit with thair vaine wordis &amp; sawis, For thay can not of this foule fact be clengit. Thocht m? wald wink, ?it God, yat all thing knawis, He will not leif this vile wark vnreuengit. The Exhortatioun to the Lordis and Nobilitie persewaris of this cruell Murther, and defendaris of our King. Psal. 5.God sayis, my Lords, he will be aduersair To bludy boucheris that stand of him na feir. My Lords, thir wordis suld curage ?ow far mair Nor the haill help of man baith far and neir. Fall to, heirfoir, with blyith and mirrie cheir. We ar anew, thairfoir heis vp ?our hartis, And fordwarts marche, sa sall we se and heir Quhat lurkand lubers will tak thir Lymmers parts. Thay fylde the feilds befoir quh? first yai faucht, Quhair we for ane, thay wer in number thre; We trowit from thence thay suld haif sittin saucht, And suld haif tyrit of all thair tyrannie. Bot now, allace! the contrare we may se: Our vaine pietie hes maid vs this fals traine. Gods Curse thairfoir lycht on thame all for me, That outher hes pietie or reuth on thame againe. Gif ?e do nocht Reuenge this fylthie fact, ?e will be schamit, ?e may weill vnderstand; And will be namit ane fals and febill pack, That euer regned in ony Realme or land. With curage, heirfoir, now be the baner stand, And wyn for euer honour and Renoun: Do ?e not this ?e ar ane bailfull band, And seruis nocht ells bot Goddis malesoun. For Gods Curse, his vengance, and maledictio?, Sall neuer from ?ou, nor fra ?our seid depart; ?e sall sustene maist sorrowfull afflictioun, That euer tholde men in ony land or airt. Sic hauie harme sall happin to ?our hart. Gif this foule murther with silence be ouer past, Thir same tratouris sall mak ?our selfis to smart, And salbe ?our distructioun at the last. And gif sa hapnis, ?e may rycht weill considder, This plaigue maist Justly of Gods hands ?e craif. Far better it is thairfoir to ryse togidder, For to reuenge the Murther with the laif, Nor Gods seir wraith abone ?our heidis to haif, For the ouerseing of sic a fylthie cryme; For Gods plaigues approchis, I persaif, Gif ?e defer schort quhyle and suffer tyme. Fall to thame fraklie, to fecht thay haif na faces; Persew thame peirtly and ?e sall se thame fle; Rune is thair glas, and gone now is thair graces, In to respect of this foule tratorie. XII. The Regentis Tragedie ending with ane exhortatioun. Iames, Earle of Murray, Regent of Renoun, Now lyis deid and dulefullie put doun, Murdreist but mercy, murnand for remeid, Quha lost his lyfe in Lythquo with ane loun (Giltles, God wait, betraist in to that toun, Slane with ane schot, and saikles put to deid;) Feit be our fais throw fellonie and feid; Hangman to Hary, now Burrio to hir brother: Weill may this murther manifest the tother! Quhat leid in lyfe wald nocht lament his lose? Wais me to want him! is the commoun voce: For sic ane Prince sall neuer pure man haif, Tint be ane Tratour steilling vp ane close, Possest in purpois, lyfe for lyfe to cose, Bot na compair, ane Kings Sone to ane knaif. Sen he is gone agane my will to graif, Throw all this Realme I dar weill mak this ruse: Rang nocht his maik sen buryit was the Bruse. To keip gude reule he raid, and tuke na rest, Baith South and North, and sumtyme eist &amp; west, All to decoir our commoun weill, ?e knaw. Be quhome, lat se, wes Pirats sa opprest? Or ?it the theiffis sa dantonit, dung, and drest? Argyle and Huntlie hid thame baith for aw; And, quhen he mycht, he myst nocht in the Law Twyse on the day, and sleipit nocht in sleuth, To se na buddis suld beir thame by the treuth. Of this foule fact suppois our fais be fane, ?it efter Moysis Josua come agane To gyde the pepill, geuand the gloir to God. Suld thay succeid that hes him saikles slane? Be war with that, I wald ?e war not vane To haif ?our waik anis wirryit with the tod: Think ?e with ressoun thay suld reule the rod, With double murther maid vs all ado, And with our King wald play Cowsauly to? Pray, gif ?e pleis, I warne ?ow ?e haif neid To keip our King fra cankrit Ked?ochis seid, That daylie wayis Inuentis to put him doun; His Grandschir slane at Lythquo gif I leid; His gudschir thryse hes left this land in deid; Hary at midnycht murdreist in this toun; His Cousing last, and ?it thay clame the Crown: Blynd Jok may ges gif thir be godly deidis: Brunt be ?one Bischop in quhome this barret breidis! Cut of that Papist, Prothogall of partis, That with his lesingis all the laif peruertis; Syne Joyne ?our forces to the feildis but feir, Because ?e tak ?our stoutnes all in startis. To Hammiltoun in haist quhill ?e haif hartis; Deuyse sum way to pay ?our men of weir, Fra he be gane ?e neid nocht gather geir: Fecht weill and war yame and wyn the ryches yair, And gif ?e de, in deid ?e neid na mair. Curst be ?e baith, bischop and Bothwell-hauch! For this foule deid ?our seid man rak ane sauch; Gif ?e twa want the widdie now thay wrang ?ow; Lythquo, lament, ?our burges may luke bauch, In beir seid tyme ?our burrow rudis ly fauch Cause of this murther laitly maid amang ?ow; Or, gif I trowit it helpit ocht to hang ?ow, Sa suld ?e die; and syne ?our towne in fyre, Sum part for sythment to asswage our Ire. Ouer thir twa housis, for thair deids inding, The hand of God dois ouer thair heidis hing Thame to distroy; I dout not, in our dayis, Hepburnis will wraik for wyrrying of the King. Bot Hammiltounis! fy! this was ane foular thing. Is this ?our ferme Religioun? ?ais? ?ais? Sic tyme sall cum, I trow, as Thomas sayis: Hirdmen sall hunt ?ow vpthrow Garranis gyll, Castand thair Patlis, and lat the pleuch stand still. Apperandly thir plaigis ar powrit out To wraik this warld, and wait ?e quhair about? Because we want na vice vnder the heuin; Sen double murther markis to reule the rout, With Niniueitis lat vs ga cry and schout, For to retreit ?one sentence Justly geuin: ?it thow, gude Lord, that Judgis all thingis euin, Seand the perrell that ouer the pepill standis, Lat nocht thair blude be socht at saikles handis. Now Lordis &amp; Lairdis assemblit in this place, Ouer lang we talk of Tragedeis, allace! Away with cair, with confort now conclude; As gude in paper as speik it in ?our face: Gif murtherars for geir get ony grace, ?e will be schent: think on, I say, for gude; Sen art and part ar gyltie of his blude, Quhy suld ?e feir or fauour thame for fleiching? ?e hard ?our self quhat Knox spak at the preiching. First on the feildis mak schortly to, lat se, We want bot ane, and quhat the war ar we, Sen God wes pleist to pas him out of pyne? All men on mold ar markit for to de, With tyme and place appointit: sa wes he. Lat nocht in cair ?our curages declyne, For want of ane I wald nocht all suld tyne. Gar reid at Roxburgh quhen the King was slane, And ?it ane woman wan the hous agane. Sen than be wemen douchtie deidis were done, Barronis, be blyith, and hald ?our hartis abone, And lat vs heir quhairfoir ?e hapnit hidder: Thay ar na partie and ?e speid ?ow sone. Albeit that Boyd be daylie in Denone, Lang or Argyle be gadderit in togidder. Quhen all is done, the counsall may considder Quhat is the maist ?one murtheraris may do, Suppois that Huntlie wald cum help thame to. Had we ane heid wald stoutly vndertak it, The Barronis sayis thay suld be bauldly bakit, Mycht thay for tyritnes trauell of thir tounis: Quhy stand ?e aw of Tratouris twyse detractit? Think ?e not schame to heir ?our Lordschipis lakit? S? feiris yair flesche, sum grenis to gadder crounis, S? happis yair heidis, s? beltis yame vp in gounis. Luke gif ?our partie prydis yame in thair spurring, Keipand the feildis, and fryis not in thair furring. Wa worth the wyfis that fostred ?ow and fed! ?e dow not ly vnles ?e haif ane bed; Keip ?ow fra cauld, haif claith within ?our scho: I think greit ferly how ?e can be red, Or fray at thame that last befoir ?ow fled Wantand thair Quene, syne God agane thame to. Quhy ly ?e heir with lytill thing ado? The Barronis biddis ?ow schortly byde or gang: Curage decayis fra Scottis men tarie lang. Haue Lyounis lukis, and than mak me ane lear; Be Hanniballis, and heis ?our hartis sum hear; Bot keip not Capua quhil ?one Knaifis incluse ?ow: He neidis not work that hes ane gude ouersear. Nane neid ?e fetch, swa that ?our hairtis war frear, Bot, be my saule, my self culd neuer ruse ?ow: I knaw weill for this cryme Christ sall accuse ?ow; For spairing Agag Saull was puneist sair, Swa sall he ?ow, I dar nocht say na mair. The Lord of Hostes that heuin' &amp; eirth c?mandis, To keip our King from all vnhappy handis, The Quene of Ingland and her Counsall to. ?e feir the Frenchemen suld ouerlay thir landis, Bot I heir say be sum that vnderstandis, The Doctouris doutis bot thay haif mair ado: Our Quene is keipit straitly, thair standis scho: Ingland will help ?ow and ?e help ?our sellis, And, be the contrair, craif thame nathing ellis. This fair ?e weill: I flait not to offend ?ow In sempill veirs, this Schedull that I send ?ow; Beseikand ?ow to schort it gif ?e may. Steill ?e away, the wyfis will vilipend ?ow, And, gif ?e byde, the burrowis will c?mend ?ow. Best wer, I think, mycht we preuene ?one day. Thair Semblie beis on Sonday, I heir say, In Glasgow towne, thinkand to fecht or fle: It lukis weill, thair, ?e get na mair of me. Finis. The Tragedeis Lenuoy. As men recordis, in deid, my Lordis, I schrink not for to schaw; Suppois ?e crak, ?e ly abak, And lybellis be the Law. ?e mak not to, as men suld do, I trow ?e stand sum aw: Suppois ?e hecht, to se ?ow fecht That day will neuer daw.

Mak of the towne, and cow thame downe, Now or ?our curage cule: For Maddie sayis, byde ?e aucht dayis, ?e be not thair quhill ?ule.

And sum thair bene waittis on the Quene, Bot gaip ay quhill thay get hir: And war scho heir, I tak na feir, The Feynd aby we set hir. For we ar now als stark, I trow, As farn?er quhen we met hir; Quhen all is done thay start ouer sone To boist and not the better. I think it best ?e tak na rest, Gif ?e durst vnder tak it; And we be trew, we ar anew, ?e salbe bauldly bakit.

This warld it waggis I wat not how, And na man may ane vther trow, And euerie man dois pluke and pow, And that the pure may finde: Our Court it is decayit now: The cruikit leidis the blinde. Althocht the warldlie wise be cruikit, This commoun weill he hes miscuikit, Our Lordis ar blinde and dois ouerluik it: He gydes thame as he list. Tak thay not tent he will not huik it, To gyde thame in the mist. He halds our Lords at variance, He garris the tane put esperance Thay will get daylie help of France; This he garris thame confide: Sayis Ingland will bring mony Lance Vnto the vther side. Our Lords ar now delt in twa sydis, And euerie faction in him confydis: ?e will heir tell how he thame gydis, And ?e leif ?eiris few: Sen he hes maid sa mony slydis Trow ?e he can be trew? Fra he in Court in credite grew He did ay change the Court anew, The Quene his doingis sair did rew, And richt sa did hir Mother: The counsall kennis gif he was trew To him that was hir Brother. In Edinburgh quhen thay conuene, Our Lords to him thay gang bedene; As he was outher King or Quene He hes thame at his bidding: His craftie counsall will be sene, Quh? Doggs barkis on ye midding. Albeit he haif the Feuer quartane, He suld be made Knycht of the Gartane; He rewlis Edinburgh and Dunbartane, As Maddie dois me tell: Gif he war Pape, I am richt certane, He wald reule heuin and hell. Gif he gar Athol do sic schame, As to consent to bring hir hame, And gif the gyding to Madame, They will put downe the King: The Crowne will alter fra that Name, Than murderars may sing. He hes gart Hume begin to tyre, Althocht that he gat his desyre; Bot he will leid him in the myre Thocht he hecht to defend him: And Ingland set his lands in fyre I wat not quha will mend him. Als he gat Setoun out of hands, From forfalting he sauit his lands, Thocht he be lyand vnder bands He will not knaw the King: Sen ?e ken how the mater stands, Suld he haif leif to fling? Our richt Regent, quha was our targe, Laid sindrie things vnto his charge, The quhilk in deid war verray large, As is kend with anew: ?e haif geuin him ane plane discharge, And sayis it was not trew. I wat ?e saw neuer ane styme, And wantit baith ressoun and ryme, Quhen ?e forgaif him all his cryme, And maid his oddis euin: Thocht he be fristit at this tyme, He will not be forgeuin. I pray ?ow, Lordis, on ather syde, That ?e his sawis do not confyde, For I will sweir ?ow be Sanct Bryde, He susseis not thre strais Quha suld be rewlar nor our gyde, May he bruke that he hais. All thir maters he dois bot mock; He hes deuysit mony sic block; He can begyle ane Landwart Jock, Except he ken him weill; Thay say he can baith quhissill and cloik, And his mouth full of meill. My Lordis, quhat is this that ?e mene? I thinke the holkis ouergangis ?our ene; I wald sum man wald scheir ?ow clene, That ?e micht se thir faultis, And be not blinde as ?e haif bene, Nor led with thame that haultis.

Gif wicked vice first sen the world began Had age be age, but punishment, Increst, In eirth lang syne yair had been nothing than, Saif only vice and malice manifest; Bot to thir dayis sic meanis God ay drest, Aganis vice that vertew ay hes streuin: Thocht ather vther be tyme hes oft opprest, Last Justice Judge bure ay the ballance euin. Sa of his plesure it plesit him prouyde Us to exerce as ship vnder the saill, Sum tyme in storme, sum tyme in temperate tyde, To let vs knaw this warld is but fraill; Betuix gude and euill markand our trauaill, In euills flude not menand our nawfrage, Princes be Justice he ordanit, in this vaill, Us to conduct as Pilats dois their Barge. And sa we se, in Storeis as we reid, Ay to thir dayis sum Magistrates did ring: Sum gude, some euill, be tyme as did succeid, At quhais plesure vertew did fade or spring. The gude did vertew, the wicked vice vpbring; Quhat plesis them, the same the pepill suittis; And sa we se the maners of the King Is ay the mark quhairat his subiectis shuittis. This part to preif be yair particular liues, It war to lang in vulgare veirs expres it At lenth, the same sen Cronickles discriues, And als experience will cause vs to confes it. And, last of all, how wicked vice Incresit Amang our selues throw Mareis negligence, And how the same began to be suppressit, Be Murrayis meane, we haif experience. Quhat vice rais vp, reuolue into ?our minds; Quhat sin, quhat shame in hir last dayis did reil, That prudent Prince, gif yat he tuik sum pynis That mys to mend, I hope ?e haif ane feill. Gif ocht he socht except ane commoun weill, The gloir of God, and Kingis obedience, And in that cause maid Justice ay his sheild: I seik na Judge but ?our awin conscience. His awin estate he cairit ay to knaw; For pompe nor pryde can na man say he preist. Societie he socht and keipit curage law, Thinkand alwayis that mesure was ane feist; His peple luifit, and cairit for the leist; For profite panst not nor his commoditie; In trouble trauellit; his c?mer neuer ceistâ Ay to his wraik and our vtilitie. Thus be his prudence vertew was erectit; In him the pure oppressed had releif; Throw him Idolatrie and vice was eiectit; Throw him Godis Kirk and peple fand releif; Throw him wes vinqueist the veildars of yis greif; Throw him yis realme fand s? stabilitie; Throw him was baneist thift, murther, &amp; reif; Piracie puneist, and deuillishe sorcerie. Sa vertew sprang, and vice began to faide; Oppressioun fled and Justice tuik the place; His godly lyfe all godly men may aide, Be his exemple, vertew to imbrace. And als his lyfe may, in ane other cace, All Princes warne heirefter to succeid, Thair foes to flatter that hes ane double face, And to be war to clap ane traytours heid. Euen as the man, the quhilk be musik playis, Mistonit stringis castis not away, we se, But peice and peice, be sundrie wrestis &amp; layis, Ilk ane with vther be tyme causis agre. Euen so that Prince thocht be humilitie His peple wyn, and concord to contrake; Bot as sum stringis will rather brek nor be, Euen so the wickit be mercy will not make. His mercy wan, bot mair his mercy tint: Not he, bot we his mercy now may rew: His mercy loist, we wan the swordis dint: His mercy saifit be murther that him slew. Suppose his mercy this bergane to vs brew, ?it mene I not but men suld mercy vse To penitents, quha myndis not vice renew, Bot nane to sic continewis in abuse. His mercy saifit quha mercy not deseruit; His mercy did preserue the arrogant; His mercy sum amangis us hes preseruit, Thocht thay seme holy in deid yat ar na sanct. His mercy saifit we wer the better want: Thair Serpents seid to tyrans wald vs thral: Because sic peple in tyme he did not dant, But warldly mercy Christ sufferit him to fall. For mortall malice and curst couetice, With wickit Inuy, commonit all in Ire; And prydefull arrogance, the mother of all vice, Aganis that Prince did cruelly conspire; His fais hartis Inflamit all in fyre, His blude to seik, Inuyfull of his gloir; Saikles to shuit him ane harlet feit for hyre, Hangman to Hary that traitouris wes befoir. O bludy bouchour, bastard of Balials blude! Quha to this Realme had nother lufe nor ?eill; O tressonable tratour! be tress? yat thocht gude Murdreis the Prince, preseruer of this weill. O sorrowfull shot! thy poysoun did doun steill Not only him quhom wofully thow woundit; Bot pure &amp; riche thy vennoume hes gart feill, Of his deir deith the stoundis him confoundit. That schot, allace! yis realme hes shot in tway; That shot to vice the portis hes oppinit plane; That shot hes Justice and vertew shot away; That shot Idolatrie is shuitand vp agane. Sic shottis vnpuneist gif l?g time yat remane, Vice sall be vertew, and vertew sall be vice: Wrang sall be richt, and richt salbe thocht vane: Ilk ane vnpuneist sall pleis thair awin deuice. That shot hes sinderit quhilk was togidder knit; That shot hes cuillit our curage as ye leid; That shot hes feiblit our manly force and wit; That shot our sichts hes blindit all in deid. We se and spyis not our sorrowis to succeid; We meint &amp; meinis this wickitnes correck; We wald and will not hank yame be ye heid, Quha hes preparit the swordis for our nek. Vagabounds we wander in miserie &amp; wo, As ship but Ruther, sa ga we now but gyde: We skail, we scatter, we wait not quhair we go, Spyis not the rock quhair? we rashe our syde. We haif na grace nor power to prouyde Aganis this rage, and crueltie remeid; Bot willingly, allace! throw arrogance &amp; pryde Offers this Realme as Sacrifice to deid. In place of peace now murther weir vprasis; In place of lufe Inuy amangis vs springis; In place of Faith his friend falset betrasis; In place of rest Rebellioun with vs ringis; In place of ane we haue so mony Kingis, The Crownit King gettis na obedience. S? France for aide &amp; sum Ingland inbringis, The ane for wrak, the tother for defence. And so this Realme, quhilk enemeis oft sayit With cruell weir and sturdie stormis fell, Quhilk feirful force of Ingland neuer frayit, Of France the feir, nor Spaine in iust quarrel, Quhilk to thir dayis vnuenqueist buir ye bell, Sall now, allace! be fatell destenie, As Aiax wes, be vanquer of the sell, On proper knyfe constraynit for to die. Quhat wald, allace! our Kings &amp; elders say, Gif in thir dayis from heuin yai now discendit, To se this Realme so dulefully decay, In quhais defence yair lusty lyuis thay endit? Thay wald, I trust, repent yair time sa spendit; Thay wald, I wait, yair labouris loist forthink, To se yair Babes ye blude quhilk yai defendit Aganis nature sa cruelly vpdrink. Justlie yis plague I dout not we deseruit, Seikand the menis of our awin mischeif. Bakwart from God because we haif sueruit, Thairfoir we taist his punischment in greif. ?it, in his mercy haifand ay beleif, Still sall I pray his deuine Maiestie Aganis this rage to send vs releif, Our King to saif, and his Nobilitie. Lenuoye. Go, bony bill, deploir Of deith the dolent stound, Quhilk did our Prince deuoirâ James, Regent of Renoun. I pray the go, declair the wo, Sen syne that dois abound: I gif command, throw burgh and land The same ?ow gar resound. Our cair may moue the stonis And hauie rockis to rair: Swa mony stormes at onis Struke neuer land sa sair.

O worthy wicht, most vail?eant, war, &amp; wyse! O Capitane, ay constant to the King! O Lustie Lord, that will na wayis maling! O Barroun bauld, of Cheualry the floure! O perfyte Prouest, but maik into this Ring! O gudely Grange, but spot vnto this houre! I the beseik to call to memorie The worthie deids done be that Prince sinceir, King James the Fyft, quha restis in heuin so hie, To the quha was his tender seruand deir; How in the day he vsit the as his peir, And luifit the so as man culd lufe ane vthir, At nicht in bed his fellow and his feir, Esteming the as thow had bene his brother; And how his Sone, our Regent of Renoun, That restis with God, quha did thir thingis persaif, Thocht he be gone and with his fais put doun, ?it in his lyfe he luifit the by the laif; Ay geuing the quhat thing that thow wald haif, Denying nocht that lay into his handis: For thy seruice thy fie was not to craif, Bot recompancit with gold, with geir, and landis. And quhen the Duke put the to banischment, And from the held thy landis mony ?eir, Thow knawis thy self gif he was diligent To get thy peax, and slaik the of that weir, And to the get thy lands, thy guds, and geir. Thocht thair was sum that tuik thy rowmis in few, ?it he to the gat thame, as is maist cleir, To preif he was to the ane Maister trew. Fra tyme the Lord did call him to that cure, Into this Realme that he suld ring allone, He the estemit of steidfast faith most sure, Thairfoir that hauld, and worthie hous of stone He gaif to the with Jowallis mony one, As vnto him that he luiffit by the rest, The quhilk in deid he wald haue done to none Of all his brether that he luiffit best. Seytoun, Schir James, bot &amp; the Schiref of Air, Efter the feild he gaif thame in thy cure; The Duke him self and Hereis thow had thair, For in thy handis he thocht thame ay most sure. Sum said to him thairin he did Iniure To put sa mony greit men in thy bandis: His answer was, quhill that he might Indure, His lyfe and all he wald put in thy handis. Hauing this hauld, as I haue done declair, In Counsell hous the Toun, with ane consent, Cheissit the to be thair Prouest and thair Mair, As man thairto meit and conuenientâ Quhilk office is in deid richt ancientâ Under the King this Burgh to reull and steir. During thy office, culd thow stand content, Thow micht to Lordis be perigall and peir. Thir officis the farther did promote, It neidis na preif, thy self will testifie, Amang the Lordis thow gat baith place and vote, At Secreit Counsall, in materis most hie; Lyke as thame selfis sa thay estemit the Into thair caus baith bent, Just, and vpricht. Quhen tyme requyris, it suld Reuengit be: Think on his deith, that brocht the to sic hicht. In humbill wyse heirfoir I the Exhort, With tentyue eir vnto my taill attend: I the desyre thre thingis in termis schort, First, in Gods caus be constant to the end; Syne nixt, our King with all thy micht defend, Himself, his lawis, his libertie, and Croun; Thirdly, vnto the warld thow mak it kend, He was thy Maister Bothwell-hauch put doun. Into Religioun thow was richt feruent; God gif the grace thairin to perseueir! That tyme at Leith thair was na man mair bent; During that Seige I saw the prick full neir. Of lyfe nor landis that tyme thow tuik na feir, Ay venturand quhair greitest war the dangeris, For to set furth the word of God most cleir, And for to freith thy Natiue Realme fra strangeris. And now thow seis how mony dois maling, Baith tyme and tyde schawand thair force &amp; micht, To that Intent that Jesabell suld Ring, Quha wald suppres the word of God most bricht, And from our King (allace) wald reif his richt, Quhome to thay swore thay suld be alwayis trew; Als dois defend with force baith day and nicht Thay Tratouris strang, our Royall Regent slew. The word of God for euer sall preuaill, And als his Kirk sall haue the ouer hand. Pharo and his he brocht in mekill baill, Quhen he led Israell saif throw se and sand. And als the Kingis Authoritie sall stand, As Dauids did, thocht Saull did him molest: Sa sall our King at lenth posses this land, As vtheris hes, in quyetnes and rest. This godly caus did euer prosper still, Sen he was King, our Gouernour, and gyde. Baith at Carbarry and the Langsyde hill, The michtie God was euer on his syde. Now in the North his fais thay durst nocht byde, Quhair throw that pak did lois thair men of weir, And, quhen thay war the last tyme vpon Clyde, Thair durst na fa into thair sicht appeir. Murther thow knawis will not vnpuneist be, Nor neuer was sen Cayn Abell slew; The Scripture plane the same dois testifie That murtherars Gods wraith sall not eschew. Sall thay eschaip murdreist our Regent trew, Of vertewis well, of euerie vice denude? Thocht thair war nane his deith that wald persew, The michtie God he wald Reuenge his blude. Dois thow not se ye hand of God agane yame, Wirking thair wrak for breking his command? Thocht Lethingtoun with tratling he do trane thame, Garring thame trow the Frenche men is at hand, And Duke De Alb ay reddy for to land, With mony Hulk, on hicht of Arthure sait: Quhill that tyme cum we sall lay on the wand, And gar our fais gif clene ouir all debait. Quhat neids ye skar, thocht Ingl?d do support vs, To puneis sic as proudly dois Rebell? That tyme at Leith thow knawis that did comfort vs, And maid vs fre quhen strangers did vs quell, And neuer socht na proffite to thame sell: Thow neids not feir, that hous thay neuer craifit: The Regent sayis, sa far as I heir tell, Wald thow be trew thair can na better haif it. Thocht at this tyme thow haif that warlyke craig, And is in hart curagious and bald, God will nocht mys to scurge the with a plaig, Gif in his caus thow lat thy curage cald. As thow may se, thick scurgis monyfald Lich vpon thame that proudly dois disdane. Except the Lord be watche man of the hald, Quha walkis the same, thair laubour is in vane. Thow hes bene ane sen first this caus began, And als hes sene how God gart it proceid, Heirfoir, I pray, ?it do the thing thow can Into Gods caus, and to Reuenge his deid.

Mak to, lyke m?, sen ye haif ordinance, Ding Draffen do?, yat hald quhairin yai pryde yame: Bring in ye north with b?vart, bow, &amp; Lance; Gif thay rebell, with fyre and sword ouir ryde yame. How &amp; quhat way ye suld appost your bordour, Maddeis counsall is verray excellent; Scho did prescriue ane gude &amp; godly ordour, That to performe, had ye been diligent: Hard ye the pure, I wait, ye wald lament, Sa cruelly thay Tyranis dois oppres thame, Slaying yame selfis; yair gudis, reit, and rent, For feir of God, I pray yow to redres thame. Quhat m? did hoip of Gr?ge now dois appeir: His cloikit craft of malice dois outspring, As in his Proclamatiouns ye may heir: He dois Rebell and will not serue the King. Traitours yai ar agane yow to maling, He being Crownit in lauchfull Parliament: Quha dances fastest with him into yat Ring, To his Crowning baith sweir &amp; gaif consent. Quhen the Regent gaif him that hauld, ye saw He was the Kingis &amp; sweir theirfoir to stand, Albeit yat now his grace he will nocht knaw, Nor ?it Lennox for Regent of this land. ?it Robert Hepburne being in his hand, And saifly enterit within that place, He said he was reset by his command, And send Robert to my Lord Regents grace. Quhill yat he gat yat hauld and hous in hand, Into this caus he was baith bent and bauld; Bot fra thyne furth than he gaif ouir yat band, And in this caus he leit his curage cauld. This is the treuth, as trew men to me tauld; That samin tyme his maister was on lyue, He wald not lat him enter in that hauld, With na seruands bot outher four or fyue. He hes not onlie sueruit fra our actioun, Bot dowbill murther he dois fortifie, Desyring bargane of ony of our factioun Of his degre, estait, and qualitie. We haue nane sic, ye knaw, in cumpanie, Him for to match quhilk playit ye dowbil Knaif; For first he slew ane Maister cruellie, And syne betraist the last, ye may persaif. Bot ?it I knaw yair is ane hundreth heir Of gentill men, and cum of Royal Race, On hors or fute with quhinger, sword, or speir, Dar weill him matche &amp; meit him face for face, And preif him fals and Tratour in this cace: He dar not fecht, for this is his refuge, He wald compeir at euery tyme and place, Gif that he had ane vnsuspectit Judge. And als ye see, he planely dois accuse The Regents grace of cruell Tyrannie Aganis his fais, quhilk he dois schaw and vse, In casting doun baith place and policie. Sen thay misknaw thair Just Authoritie, And will not serue, nor ?it obey commands, ?e may be Law subuert thair places hie, Syne tak fra thame yair lyuis, geir, and lands. I knaw thir letters ye fand into Dunbartane, Quhilk dois declair his dowbil deids Inding, Is only caus, I am baith sure and certane, Quhilk garris him mak yis boist &amp; manassing. Bot ?it ye knaw it is ane commoun thing, For, weill I wait, ye haue sene mony sic: Tuiche anis the gaw &amp; yan the hors wil fling, Fra tyme ye spur and hit him on the quik. It is your hous that maks him be sa bauld, Agane baith God and King for to disdane: Except the Lord be watchman of the hauld, The Psalmist sayis thair watching is in vane. As ye haue sene, within thir monethis twane, Ane greiter strenth ye gat, as I record, Swa will ye ?one, to God gif ye be bane, And swa commits your wisdomis to the Lord.

All Boreas bitter blastis are no? blawin; I feir sum boide and bobbis be behind; Be tyde and tempest thow may be o?thrawin, And mony fairlie fortounes thow may find, As channellis, craigges, beddis, and bankis blind, Leckand, wanlukis quhairby thow may be loist, Bewar thairfoir w? wadder, waw, and wind, With oncouth coursis, and onknawin coist. Be war w? strangearis in thy sterne to steir; Thocht on ane courss we can no? condiscend, Suppois sum ?ntt perrell now appeir, And sum hes wyritt and will no? with us wend, Be meitar meaines thow mon thatt make mend, Nor daingeris be ye doubill to divertt: Thairfoir, I pray the, prudentlie ?end, And putt not all in perell ffor a pairt. Thow will putt all intill apperand perell, Gif Inglis forcis In Ã¾is realme repair; Sic ar not meitt ffor to decide our querrell, Thocht farlandis fulis seme to have fedderis fair.

Calling to mynde the mutabiliteis Of this Inconstant warld sa variabill, Lyke to ane Schip that saillis on the seis, Tost with winds &amp; wallis Innauigabill; Bot sen I se na plesure permanabill, Bot as the weid it widderis sone away, Lat vs go seik the gloir Inestimabill, Quhair we man pas perpetually for ay. With spreit opprest, this plungit in to cair, Remembring me quhat mater to compyle, Endlang ane Park I past without repair Be Snawdoun syde, the seuint day of Apryle; And as I walkit, wandering not ane myle, Ane pieteous spreit appeirit to my thocht, Sayand: âallace! and waryit be the quhyle That I was borne, or in this warld vpbrocht!â Can I nocht tell gif be Illutioun, Or gif be feir sic fantaseis we tak; Bot this he said in schort conclusioun, Deplorit ane plaint, and planelie to me spak: âPoetis of me hes mater for to mak, In tragedie, quhat tyme I heir remanit.â And with that word I went sum thing abak, And bad say on, and, with God saif me, sanit. âI was,â said he, âane Lord leuand on lyfe, Ane bastard barne, that can I not deny: My Father was ane Erle and had ane wyfe, Thocht he abusit his body, and lay by.

A first quhen the newis begouthe to ryse, gretly thai maid me wondre, Quhow that so grett a gospellar so fellounly could fondre; Bott, seing quhow all erdly thingis wor subiect to mutatioun, Than fand I it no grett mervall, albeit the congregatioun wor no les than Ã¾e puir Papistis Inclynit to fornicatioun. Now is the cours Platonian completit haillely: the sone and Mone and sevin sterris reuoluit in Ã¾e sky, That mokis the wordle tourne top o? taill, &amp; will resson to ryde, The plewche befoir the oxin go, the best the man to gyde, And all things to misrewlit be, owte of all tyme and tyde.

Thow emptie pen! pas but experience, with dull indyte, and do thy diligence, This pure c?plaint with pietie to deploir. Of Muses vane I ask na Eloquence, Bot only God, of his greit Excellence, Him to ressaif in Euerlasting gloir, Quhome dolent deith hes laitly done deuoir; Unlukellie, allace! gif man micht mend it: Slane with ane schot: sa is the gude Lord endit. Methwen may murne, and all the bounds about, For Hary Stewart, that was bauld and stout, Constant and kynd, with qualiteis conding. In smallest danger, nane beleuand dout, Inuyous Fortoun swa did waill him out, Lyke as at Roxburgh raid scho slew our King, Ane greit foirtakin of ane weill war thing. To se the saikles puneist sa with roddis: The scharper scurge is c?mand for the Toddis. Sic is thair craft in clymming to the Crowne, The pure King Hary pieteously put downe, Nocht be thair force bot fyring of ane trane; The Erle of Murray murdreist with ane lowne, And Lennox last, ?e saw, in Striuiling Towne; Gude George Ruthuen with thay rebalds slane; Garleis, Dundas, quhilk wer baith trew &amp; plane; Dowglas of Lyntoun &amp; gude Westiraw was last, with lytill meaning, fra the men be past. Bot to my taill and Tragedie returne: The gude Lord Methuen makis me to murne, That all my senses sudd?nly doun fais.

Gif that our Lords wald craib for ony cais, wa worth the tyme he went about ?one wais! wa worth the Towne, the Castell, and the craig! Sic tyme sall cum that God sall pour his plaig. wa worth his weirds (gif ony weirds can be!) Parcas, Lacheses, Atrapus, all thre! Fy on the, Fortoun, with thy fen?eit smyle! war deid substantiall maid of stane or tre, I suld not rest, bot me reuenge on the. Micht thow not spair yat Lord to liue a quhyle? Ane of the best was borne in all this Ile. Gif it wald rute to reckin out sic taillis, Gude to be war, quhen wickitness preuaillis. Of twentie ?eiris, ?ing, and sa discreit, Meik of his maners, mansuetude, and sweit, Lord lyke, allace! he had our lytill feir; Aganis his fais ay formest on his feit, With l?mis vult, and with ane Lyouns spreit, Quha had mair grace to gouerne men of weir? And, gif I spak of Culuering, bow, and speir, He was not borne was better of sic playis, (war he not Lord) nor lyke him of his dayis. ?ing, lusty, lufesum, liberall, and large, Ane greit defender of our chosin Barge; In trublous time yow micht haif steirt ye ruther: Few better heir bene Chiftane to haue charge, Aganis Lord Greid, to beir the goldin Targe; In all this land thow left not sic ane vther. The S?cts of God may say thay want ane brother, Sic as at na tyme can thay get for graith, Sa frak, sa fordwart to defend thair faith. In the was wit, wisdome, and worthynes; In the was grace, groundit with godlynes; In the was meiknes and humilitie; In the was fredome, force, and ferynes; In the was manly mowis and maryness, with mercy, science, and Ciuilitie. To the Dame nature gaue abilitie, Pringnant of wit, of policie but peir, Rype of ingyne, with iudgement perqueir. In honest pastyme was thy haill delyte: Thow bure the toung that neuer spak dispyte; Walkryfe in weirs, and watcheman to the rest: For na offence culd thow be forsit to flyte Aganis thy seruandis, thocht thay wer to wyte; But with thy wysdome weyit it at the best: Thy houshald trim and treit weill, thay confest, Quhairfoir thay mys the mair nor all the laif, Quhen thay remember on the giftis thow gaif.

May not thir murthers mufe thy hart to Ire? Gif thow had mettall, man, to bring the to! Thy dowbill faith may not abyde the fyre, Swa misbeleif sall leif the in the myre. Or hes thy wyfe the wyte of it? quhair is scho? Defend the caus, man, quhill the King cum to: Gif naturall kyndnes kindillis vp thy breist, We, beand doun, na dout thow salbe neist. God saue King James, thow may say, allace! Exceptand only God mon gyde thy grace; For temporall Lords, thay leif the few on lyue; Thy Father murdreist in ane mischant place, Syne baith thy Regents of ane Royall race, with sindrie vther Nobills four or fyue; And, last of all, I laith wer to discryue The manly Methwen mischantly put downe, Slane for thy saik for sauing of thy Crowne. For the mantenance of thy lyfe and law I note bot few, or nane, with sic ouirthraw, As only Ruthwen: this my ressoun quhy: His Father first, gif I the suith suld schaw, Deit in exyle for honest caus, ?e knaw; His douchtie brothers deith can nane deny; Now Methwen last, beleuand sorrow by, Quhilk hes mair barrat to his breist inbrocht, Nor all the laif, gif he culd leif his thocht. Thocht we be subiect to mortalitie, ?it God Indewis vs with sic qualitie That naturall kyndnes causis vs to cair; Bot let na Carnall Corporalitie Conplane on Christ for partialitie, To tak his awin men outher lait or air: Lat deid to deid, and die not in dispair; Ryse and reuenge the Ruthwen on ?one rout: Quhat will it mend to murne thy senses out? As to the Lords that hes begun this actio?, I feir thair tyme be turnand to detractioun, Gif thay repent not this I spak befoir; Exame thair conscience of particular pactioun, Gif thay be fauourers of the tother factioun, (And gif swa be,) thair mys mon be the moir; God will not be abusit with sic vane gloir: The storme approches quhen ye Poills are fairest, The langer spairit, the plaigue is ay the sairest. The day is neir, as I dar weill deplane ?ow, The wraith of God is lyke to gang aganis ?ow For spairing men of Macheuillus Scuillis: How may ?e saue ?one smaiks yat wald haif slane ?ow? And ?e wer in yair h?ds, yai wald not hane ?ow; Thay play the men &amp; ?e the febill fuillis: Quhat is the caus, let se, ?our curage cuillis? Particular proffeit, durst I speik it out, ?it thay ar daylie murdreist doun thay dout. To mak sic change, ?e wair ?our wit in vane, As thairs for ouris, and ouris for thairs agane: Thair m? ?e grant yair gro?d all gude as ?ours; Bot, quhair ?e gat thame, wald ?e flour the grane? That beand done, na dout thay wald be fane For to renounce thair Law and cum to ours; Do ?e not sa, ?e sall thoill scharper schours, Sic vane excambion can I not considder, As marrow tratours and the trew togidder. I dar be bauld to say sen this began, Had we bot vsit the victorie we wan, With gloir to God that gaif thame in our hands, we nedit not or now to want ane man. Bot quhen we tak thame, solistatioun than Dois clap thair heid; the counsall sa commandis: Quhairfoir I feir that God sal burne ye wandis, As, for exempill, I can let ?ow seit, For spairing sinfull, how the saikles deit. As Quheit is strukin for the stra besyde, And siluer fyne mon to the Furnes glyde, To get the dros deuydit, as we se, Thocht King Josias did in Christ confyde, Befoir the plaigue come, God will sa prouyde: He will not thoill the iust with thame to die; Bot, quhair he takis away sic men as he, The riche, the wyse, the Capitane, or the gyde, Thair sall the pepill punischment abyde. Quhat nedit Noy for sin to suffer wrak? Nor faithfull Lot, bot for the wickits saik? Caleb and Josua in c?ming to the land? For Ophny and Phines, that the battell straik, The Innocent Ely all his banis braik; The Ark of God was caryit of thair hand, And ?it thair fais micht better haue lattin it stand: Suppois the saikles slane was for offences, ?it did the Phelistims faill of thair pretences. And gredy Acan, for the geir he hidâ Twa golden braislettisâlytill thing he did: ?it was the pepill puneist for sic playis. Haue we sic wrangous geirâna, God forbeidâ As Crowats, Sensours, or ane Challeis leid? Quhilk will be found na fault now heir a dayis. For spairing Agag, as the Scripture sayis, The hous of Saule was puneist, and his seid, Not spairing Jonathan for his douchtie deid. Siclyke King Dauid thoillit pane and greif: His wickit barnetyme brocht him to mischeif: His Capitane, Joab, Absolone forbure; Bot far ma Joabs heir, for thair releif, with solistatioun, quhen we tak ane theif, Suppois ?e wist he wrocht ?our self iniure, Swa sum beleuis, haue baith the sydes sa sure; And ?it I hope thay sall not want thair hyre, As Absolone set Joabs corne in fyre. The King Roboam raschely did ouirluik The auld wyse counsall, and the fulische tuik; Quhairfoir he tynt his kyndlie Trybes ten. And Jeroboam, in that samin buik, Set vp new Idols and his God forsuik, Quhill Abiah slew fyue hundreth thousand men: Swa Bennadab was Captiue, as ye ken, Bot, quhair the iust dois ioyne thame with forsakin, Be war thay get not wickit Acabs takin. Quhat dois it proffeit Poetrie prophane? Sen trew Preicheours speikis it to ?ow plane, ?it neuer mercy in your mynd remordis: As fruteles seid it neuer growis a grane. Bot to my taill heir I returne agane: This Tragedie may staik, to tell the Lordis, Ane thousand fyue hundreth Sempill sa recordis Thre scoir and twelf, suppois the veirse be vane, The thrid of marche was worthy Methw? slane. Finis with the Dytone Quod Sempill.

For it is ouirgane with a flude Of murther, and of saikles blude: Allace! for leif to flyte!

For innoc?ts ar murtherit downe, without remors, in land and towne: Quhat leid may leif on lyfe? And thay hald gait, I trow, frahand Sic murther salbe, in all land, Of Children, man, an wyfe; That seis als greit as Noyis flude Sall drowne ye warld of m?is blude: Quhat mischeif do thay mene? ?one cursit battell, as I trow, Quhilk thay at Trent did all auow, Thay think now to sustene.

Bot gif yat thay grow proud &amp; heich, And skar at ?ow as thay wer skeich, And on na wayis will bow thame, Let yame pas on to thair defensis, It salbe on thair awin expensis, Or all be done, I vow thame.

Away, sum sayis, to Veneis is he gone, Or to the Swisches, as thay do suppone, Quhair he is saif from danger, hurt, or skaith; Heir wald he deit of cauld and hounger baith. Thus am I left as wedow in distres For commoun-weill: my bairnis left Fatherles. Children I had, in all vertewis perfyte: To peice and Justice was thair haill delyte. Sum of displesure deit for wo and cair; Sum wyrreit was, and blawin in the air; And sum in Stirling schot was to the deid, That mair was geuin to peice nor Ciuile feid. Bot ane was slane, vnto my skaith and schame, Becaus he socht to fetch my husband hame: He was my deir and best belouit Sone; All that he did, for my weilfair was done.

My Lace and Mail?eis tane be Variance; My Stomak worne is be dissimulance; My belt is cuttit of pure Gluttonie; My leggs and feit now schod with Pouertie; My hart is seik; my stomach keipis na meit; My bowells Rumbills as thay wald vther eit. Now for to couer all this villannie, Ane Cloik thay gif me of authoritie. Authoritie, (alaik!) na les thay mene, For thay desyre neuer to se thair Quene; Bot that thay may in hir Name bruik offices, With power to cleik vp the benefices. Nane I excuse on ather syde; for quhy Ilk ane his awin hous seikis to edify, And nane dois cair for Commoun-weill ane prene. I grant I had ane Douchter was ane Quene, Baith gude and fair, gentill and Liberall, Dotit with vertewis and wit Naturall; Prignant in Spreit, in all things honourabill, Lusty, gude lyke, to all men fauourabill; Schamefull to euill, baith honest, meik and law; Thir vertewis all scho had, quhyls scho stude aw Of God Eterne, as of hir Gouernour, And quhen scho did regaird hir hie Honour. Bot at the last, throw filthy speiche and Counsell, That scho did heir of sum curst Kittie vnsell, Fra scho gaif eir to sic vyle bawderie, God, Schame, and honour, scho for?et all thre. It wer to lang the vices to reheirse, Quhairin from thyne scho did hir self exerce: The Reidar wald thame think maist Insolent, Bot I thame leif, becaus thay ar Recent: For quhilks scho was thocht vnworthy to Ring, Ane Crowne to bruik or ony Royall thing: Sa all my Children, with hir awin consent, Deposit hir in oppin Parliament. Than wald scho that thay suld hir awin sone crowne, Quhilk thing thay did sa Syce vp and Sink downe: God saue his Grace: for quhy the same is he In me that hes the trew authoritie. Praisit be God, I haue, fre at command, That fair ?oung Prince in Stirling, my richt hand. Wer not in hope I leif to se that day, That he sall purge thir foull humouris away, And me restoir agane vnto my helth, ?ea, caus my Children flurische in all welth: Wer not he is brocht vp in all gude thing Affeiring to ane Godly Prince and King, Be gude Lord Deddy, my trew faithfull freind, Cum of ane race of men to me maist kynd; For Lady Minnie, I dar tak in hand, Happy is he hes sic ane gouernand: Wer not thir thingis that maks me leif in hope, At libertie to se this Lyoun scope, One day to Rore and Ramp vpon his fois, To bring thame law, that now sa proudly gois: Wer not thir thingis, I say, and vthers mo, I wald dispair, and die for pane and wo. To ?ow, Vapouris, and watters in the air, And seyis sa deip, I downe my plaint declair. ?e seyis, I say, gif passage, and ?e can, Till sum faithfull to bring hame my gude-man. And ?e, my Kirk, my Faithfull Mother deir, That purgit art of Channoun, Monk, and Freir, Of Papist Priest, Papist, and Papistrie, Bot not, allace, clene of Hypocrasie, Of auarice, pryde and ambitioun, Thocht ?e haue left all Superstitioun: I grant the word of God is trewlie Preichit, And in the schuills Exercise trewlie teichit; ?it, sayis the Commounis, ?e do not ?our office, For vpaland thay haue not dew seruice: The rowmis appointit pepill to confidder, To heir Gods word, quhair thay suld pray togidder, Ar now conuertit in scheip Coits and Fauldis, Or ells ar fallin, becaus nane thame vphauldis; The Parische Kirkis, I mene, thay sa misgyde That nane for wynd and rane thairin may byde: Thairfoir na plesure tak thay of the tempill; Nor ?it to cum quhair nocht is to contempill Bot Crawis and Dowis cryand and makand beir, That nane throuchly the Minister may heir; Baith Fedders, Fylth, and Doung dois ly abrod, Quhair folk suld sit to heir the word of God; Quhilk is occasioun to the aduersaryes To mok and scorne sic things befoir ?our eyes. Thus to disdane the hous of Orisoun Dois mak folk cauld to thair Deuotioun. And als thay do disdane to heir Gods word, Thinking the same to be ane Jesting bourd; Thay go to labour, drinking, or to play, And not to ?ow vpon the Sabboth day: Sa thay prouoke the wraith of God, allace! Quhilk hes maid me to fall in this distres. ?it suld I not blame ?ou, that sic dois perische, Bot Lords, and Lairds, &amp; C?mouns of ilk Parische, The quhilk wer wont for to caus euerie pleuch, In vphalding the Kirk, to pay aneuch. To do the same ?e suld thame ?it exhort, Togidder that thay suld the pure support. The Prouerb is: of Palice, Kirk and brig, Better in tyme to beit nor efter to big. ?e collegis and Uniuersitie, That to all vthers suld exempill be, I se ?our tempills cassin downe and reuin: The maist part are bot theikit with the heuin. This, quhilk to ?ow I do sa planely wryte, The commounis speiks of ?ow and dois bakbyte.

Quhat haue ?e wyn sensyne? lat se ?our ganis: Gar pryse ?our proffeit, &amp; esteme ?our panis. The panis, I wait, the proffeit will surmont, A greit daill moir nor ?e can mak ?our compt. I find, sensyne the ?ow hes borne the bell, Wyfis Maisters bene in geuing haill Counsell To Lords and Lairds; I speik generallie, As may be sene, allace! ouir weill on me. Hume, Huntly, Grange, and all ?e of that syde, Behald now how ?e do the mater gyde, To caus my Sisters France and Ingland scorne ?ow, That walterars of Courts ?e lat suborne ?ow: ?it ?e and thay did sweir with aithis conding, And did subscryue to be trew to the King. In takin quhairof, with all ?e did aggre, To Crowne and place him in authoritie. Gif ?e wirk weill, ?our deids ane day will schaw, For raising fyre aganis my actis and law, In halding towns and strenths ?our King aganis, Putting the rest of ?our brether to panis; Quhome I excuse not, as I said befoir, For I persaif, ambitioun and vane gloir And gredynes to reule dois blind ?ow baith, Quhilk dois redound to my greit hurt and skaith. ?our tennents plen?eis that thay ar opprest Be ?ow and ?ours, that dois thame soir molest. ?e hicht yair maills; yair pleuchs ?e dowbil on yame; Thay tyne thair tyme at sic things to opone yame; For na rest will ?e get into ?our raggs, Gif sum sect knaw that thay haue geir or baggs; ?our Nichtingaills will sing sa in ?our eiris, That ?e sall nichtly haue Domestik weiris. â?on carle,â quod scho, âmy Joy, dois beinly dwell, And all prouisioun hes within himsell, In barne or byre, in hall, Girnell, and Seller; His wyfe weiris weluot on hir Gowne and Coller; Thay ar sa riche, that thay do vs misknaw; Than better sone to drag nor lait to draw.â Sone in his Gersum hichtit, and his Maillis; Him self grows waik, his geir and houshald faillis: Quhair sic wer wont to haue Guse, Cok, and Hen, Breid, drink, and bedding, to treit honest men, Now drink thay Mylk and Swaits in steid of Aill, And glaid to get Peis breid and watter Caill: Quhair sic wer wont to ride furth to the weir, With Jak and Sword, gude hors, Knapscull, &amp; speir; Quhair sic wer wont brauely to mak thame bowne, With Lord or Laird to ryde to Burrowis towne; Quhair sic wer wont at all Games to be reddy, To schuit or loup, for to exerce thair body: Now mon thay wirk and labour, pech and pant, To pay thair Maisters Maillis exhorbitant; Ryue out the Mures; the bestialls gers intak: Thay ar sa waik thay dow not beir a Jak, And gets waik bairns, euill nureist, in distres: Sa be sic wayis my Commouns dois dicres. My torment sair constrynis me this to speik; Na merweil quhy, for I am wondrous seik; Beseiking ?ow my seiknes to remeid, Quhilk may be done, ceissing ?our Ciuile feid To follow Christ and his Commandement, Quha said, befoir his last department; âIlk one lufe vther with sic freindly lufe, That ?e may be the bairnis of God abufe; And cleith ?ow with fair Garments clene &amp; quhyte, Without malice, contentioun, or dispyte, Aganis my c?ming quhilk trewly salbe, Quhen ?e leist wene, in twinkling of an Ee.â Thus said the Lord to ?ow, and to all men, That be thir marks thay sall God's children ken. Heirfoir, my Nobills, seik peice, do that ?e can To follow Christ, and chais away Sathan, With his Supposts, and all that taks in hand For to diuorse me from my gude husband. Now ?e, my Burges, Craftis, &amp; Merchand men, And ?e, my Commounis, with my hynd ?emen, To ?ow I haue sum purpois for to say, How, quhen, and quhy, my husband fled away. First, thair come in, lurkand vpon ?our gait, Pryde and Inuy, with Falset and Dissait. Thir four socht ludgeing all the towne about. Quhat suld thay seik? Lang time thay lay thairout, Till ane ?ule euin ?our wyfes to counsall went; Than spak ane Lawers wyfe, baith trym and gent: âC?mers,â quod scho, âit is a pietie to se Folk in a towne for cauld and hounger die; It is mair schame in Burgh for to se beggers Nor is it skaith in Crawmont to want dreggers: Quhairof dois serue our greit cheir and fair bigging, Bot for to help the pure that gais a thigging? Quhairof dois serue our husbands gold and rent, Bot to sustene the pure and Indigent? ?it lat vs ludge ?one twa that gais befoir, Pryde and Inuy, gif we will do no moir; And gif our husbands speirs quhy did we so, Answer we may, we left them vther two. Now gif ?e pleis, Cummers, I sall begin This same cauld nicht to tak ane of thame in.â âWe knaw thame not,â quod thay; âbot tak ?e ane, We must not leif the vther bird alane.â So thay did skaill; and scho tuke with hir Pryde; And on the morne scho come furth lyke ane bryde, With hir new Gaist, als proud as ane Paycok, And in hir hart scho did hir cummers mok: Quhilk quhen thay saw, with speid thay ran in hy, And for dispyte amangs thame ludgit Inuy, In counterfuting hir in all kin things, Courche, Coller, Cloik, Belt, Braislets, &amp; Rings. Then wox the Lawers wyfe richt proud in hart; Bot ?it hir cummers callit scho apart, Saying, âCummers, quhat is the caus, and quhy, That, in dispyte of me, ?e treit Inuy?â âBecaus,â quod thay, âthat ?e alone tuik Pryde, And thocht that we suld not marche ?ow besyde; Thairfoir we thocht in that point ?e did wrang vs:â âAggre,â quod scho, âand ludge thame baith amang vs.â Quhilk thing thay did, and all did condiscend To treit and keip thame to the warlds end. Thus hes ?our wyfis thir twa tane to be thairs, And left the vther twa for ?our affairs. Quhilk seing ?e and ?our wairs gros and grof, And with ?our wyfis thir two so muche maid of; ?e gros geir left, and went for wyne and spyces, Frenche claith and silks, for to cleith vp thir vyces: Quhilks for to out with dowbill met and mesure, The vther tway ?e ludgeit at thair plesure. Quhat wald ?e moir? ?e wait weill quhat I mene: Disludge thame now, and chais thame from ?ow clene. ?e Hammer men, ?e that maks schois and claiths, ?e treit thir twa with mony manesworne aiths; And ?e lykewise, all Crafts in Generall, Alaik, I feill ?ow to thame bound and thrall: Mairouir, ?our drinking Extraordinair Maks oft ?our wyfis and bairns euill to fair: Quhen ?e wald drink in hous, ?e may be bauld To do the same at hame with ?our houshald: All byganis mend: in tyme to cum, luick ?e Begyle na man, bot wirk ?our wark trewlie. To ?ow, my Commouns, quhat mair can I say? I pietie ?ow as far furth as I may; Now pure ?e ar, ?it purer wald ?e be For vsing proud pure Prodigalitie. Thair is na Lord nor Laird in all this land, Bot ?e man counterfait in claiths fra hand, Fra top to ta, thocht ?e suld beg and borrow. Johne, ga ?our way, for it will not be for ?ow: ?e suld ?our ground grube with Simplicitie, And mak ?our claiths conforme to ?our degre; Bot ?e, ?our wyfe, and bairns, can tak na rest, Without ?e counterfait the worthyest: Buft brawlit hois, Coit, Dowblet, sark, and scho: ?our wyfe and bairns conforme mon be thairto. Leif of, and leirne ?our bairns to saw and teill: Sic doings chaist away the Commoun-weill. All thir foirfalts that I haue done reheirs, That Lords, Lairds, Ladys, and Lawers dois exerce, Kirk, Burges, Merchand, C?mouns, Crafts and all, Hes haill the wyte of this my wofull fall. Amend heirfoir and call to God for Grace, Beseiking him to gif vs rest and peace, In our lyfe tyme, that we may trewly knaw Ane God Eterne, ane Faith, ane King, ane Law; And at the last to bring vs to his gloir, To Ring with him in blys for euer moir. Amen. The Conclusion be P.R. to all and Sum. All that this reids, the mater sad will think; Sum that this heirs, I wait, will discommend it; Thocht all and sum heir at partly do schrink, ?it sory I that thay suld be offendit; Heirfoir, I wald that this wer blythlie endit. For to mak all or sum lauch at the last, Than all and sum sall heir, in tyme bypast Quhen Fornicatioun haldin was na cryme, How that sum prelats did walk, pray, and fast, And serue in Kirk according to that tyme. A prelat ane day in his bed, to sport him, Did clap his lufe with kisses soft and sweit; In this meane tyme, thair was, to recomfort him, Peirtryks and pleuers pyping on the speit. Then vp he rais, and made him for thame meit, With gude quhyte wyne and all the partinence. Quhen he had tane this on his conscience, He gaif ane greit pech, lyke ane weill fed stirk, âOch, Lord,â quod he, âNow gif me patience! Quhat stres thoill we to serue thy haly Kirk!â Imprentit at Sanctandrois be Robert Lekpreuik. Finis. XXXVIII. Ane new Ballet set out be ane fugitiue Scottisman that fled out of Paris at this lait Murther.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Now Katherine de Medicis hes maid sic a gyis, To tary in Paris the papistes ar tykit: At Bastianes brydell, howbeit scho denyis, Giue Mary slew Hary, it was not vnlykit: ?it a man is nane respectand this number; I dar not say wemen hes wyte of this cummer. ?one mask the Quene Mother hes maid thame in France, Was maikles and saikles and schamfully slane; Bot Mary conuoyit and come with ane dance, Quhill princes in sences was fyrit with ane trane; Baith tressonabill murtheris the ane and the vther: I go not in masking mair with the Quene Mother. Italianes ar tyranis and tressonabill tratoris; For gysours, deuysours, the Guysianis ar gude; Bot Frenche men ar trew men, and not of thair natouris; Than, Charlie, I farlie thow drank thy awin blude: I wyte bot thy mother wit, wemen ar vane, I greis neir to Gan?elon nor grit Charlie Mane. Thy style was Treschristien, maist Cristen King, Baith hiest and friest, and neist the impyre; Bot now Prouest Marschell in playing this spring; And ressoun for tressoun prouokis God to ire, Beleuis thow this trumprie sall stablische thy style? Our God is not deed, ?it be doand ane quhyle. Suppois that the Papistes deuysit this at Trent, To ding vs and bring vs with mony lowd lauchter, With sic cruell murther is Christ sa content, To take the and make the ane Sanct for our slauchter? Albeit he correct vs and scurge vs in ire, Be war with the wand syne he wapis in the fyre. For better is pure men nor princes periurit; Baith schameles and fameles, we find thame sa fals; With sangis lyke the seryne our lyfis thow allurit; Ouirsylit vs, begylit vs, with baitis in our hals; Or as the fals fowler, his fang for to get, Deuoiris the pure volatill he wylis to the net. In Ilis nor in Orknay, in Ireland Oneill, Thay dar not, thay gar not thair lieges be stickit: Solyman, Tamerlan, nor yit the mekle Deill, Proud Pharao, nor Nero, was neuer sa wickit: Nouther Turk nor Infidell vsis sic thing As be their awin burreo, being ane king. Baith auld men, and wemen with babis on thair breist, Not luking nor huking, to hurll thame in Sane! All beand murdreist downe, quhat do ?e neist? Processioun, confession, and vp Mes agane: Proud King Antiochus was sum tyme als haly, And yet our God guschit out the guttis of his belly. Thy syster thou maryit, thy saces was sour; Sic cuikrie for luikrie was euill interprisit; ?e maid vs the Reid Freiris, and rais in an hour, Abhorring na gorring that micht be deuisit: Thou playit the fals hypocreit fen?eing the fray, But inwart ane rageing wolf waitand thy pray. That France was confidderat with Scotland, I grant, Baith actit, contractit, and keipit in deid; The kyndnes of cutthrottis we cure not to want, Denyis thame, defyis thame, and al thair fals seid: It was bot with honest men we maid the band, And thou hes left leifand bot few in that land. Our faith is not warldly, we feir not thy braulis, Thocht hangmen ouirgang men, for gaddaring our geir, ?e kill bot the carcase, ?e get not our saulis, Not douting our shouting is hard in Goddis eir. The same God from Pharo defendit his pepill, And not ?one round Robene that standis in ?our stepill. Now, wyse Quene Elizabeth, luik to yourself, Dispite them, and wryte thame ane bill of defyance; The Papistis and Span?ards hes partit ?our pelf, As newly and trewly was tald me thir tythance: Beleue thay to land heir and get vs for nocht, Will ?e do as we do, it sall be deir bocht. Giue pleis God we gre sa, and hald vs togidder, Baith surely, and sturely, and stoutly gainstand thame; They culd not weill conqueis vs, culd ?e considder, For our men are dour men, and likis weill to land thame: Quhen Cesar himself was chaist, haue ?e for?et? And baith the realmes be aggreit, tak that thay get. For better it is to fecht it, defendant our lyfis, With speir men and weir men, and ventour our sellis, Nor for to se Frenchemen deflorand our wyfis, Displace vs, and chace vs, as thay haue done ellis; I meane, quhen the Inglismen helpit at Leith, And gart thame gang hame agane, spyte of thair teith. I cannot trow firmely that Frenchemen ar cummen, Persayfand thame haifand thameselfis into parrell: The Lord saue Elizabeth, thair ane gude woman, That cauldly and bauldly debait will our quarrell, With men and with money, baith armour and graith, As scho hes befoir tyme defendit this Faith. Thocht France for thair falset be drownit in dangeris, For causis and pausis thay plait into Pareis; ?it we ar in war estait, waitand on strangeris, Not gyding, deuyding our awin men from Mareis: So weid the calf from the corn, calk me thair dures, And slay or ?e be slane, gif sic thing occures. Bot how can ?e traist thame that trumpit ?ow ellis, Decoir thame, do for thame, or foster thair seid? And thay may anis se thair time, tent to ?oursellis, Baith haitfull, dissaitfull, ?e deill with, in deid; Anis wod and ay the war, wit quhat ?e do, And mak thame fast in the ruit gif thay cum to. God blis ?ow, my brether, and biddis ?ow gud nicht; Obey God, go say God, with prayer and fasting; Christ keip this pure ile of ouris in the auld richt, Defend vs, and send vs the life euerlasting: The Lord send vs quyetnes, and keip our ?oung king, The Quene of Inglands Maiestie, and lang mot thai ring! Finis. Quod Simpell. Imprintit at Sanctandrois be Robert Lekpriuik. Anno Do. 1572. XLIII. Ane Complaint vpon Fortoun.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Inconstant warld, fragill and friuolus, With fein?eit Fortoun! quha confides in the, Sall finde his lyfe cairfull and cruellus, Led in this vale of wofull miserie; Quhat potent princes in prosperitie Hes sho deposd from their imperiall places! Hir craft quotidian we may cleirly se, As men in mirrouris may behauld their faces. The worthie Bocas, in his morall buke, The Fall of Princes plainly dois compyle; Amangs thame all quha euer lykes to luke, Sall finde Dame Fortounis fauour for a quhyle; For with the one eye sho can lauch and smyle, And with the vther lurke and play the loun; Sum to promotioun, and some to plaine exile, Lyke draw-well bukkets dowkand vp and doun. That variable witch makis all the warld ado! Quhat kingis and countreis hes sho brocht to end! Assyrians, Persians, Grekes, and Romains to: The monarches foure micht not hir force defend. Bulworkis nor battellis bydis her nocht a bend; Quha may withstand her straik quhan sho list stryke? This nicht aneuch, the morne nathing to spend! Imago in Luna, and sho lukis baith alyke. To pen the speciallis it passis mony a hunder, And makis the tyme ouer tidious to declare; Sum sho promouis, and sum sho puttis, to, vnder, And sum rewardes with wandring heir and thair; And sum incastrat captiues in the snair, And sum for flatrie dois hir freindship find; To all estates vntruethfull, quhat sould mair, Turnand her volt lyke woddercok in wind? To paint her out it passis mine ingyne, How wonderfully she wirkes in all thir thingis! Sum fra thair birth brocht vp with doggis and swine, Tane fra the pleuch, and placit in sait of kingis. The brutell beist, ane barbour wolfe, vpbringis The first borne Romain, callit Romulus, Quhais blude as ?it into that regioun ringis, By expectatioun of auld Amelius. Cyrus siclyke was be ane bitche vpbrocht, Cround as a king, ane cruell man of weir. Pareis in Troy, that all the toun forthocht, Preseruit from slauchter be souking of a beir. And swa was Thylaphus with ane hinde, I heir; Medas with imates, and maid ane michtie prince; Plato with beis, quha did sic prudence leir, That all men meruelled of his eloquence. Without respect to blude royall, or clan, Pureanis promouit that na man wald presume; Torquinius Priscus, a baneist marchant man, Chaist out of Corinth, and cround a king in Rome. Siclyke was Seruius from ane shipherd grome; And Tullus Hostilius fand her fauour neist; Is, was, and salbe quhill the day of dome, Sic doubill dealing in Dame Fortounis breist! Quha findis hir freindship of fauour hes aneuch; To warldly glore sho gydes them all the gait; Tuke sho not Gordias from the spaid and pleuch, And quickly placit him in a princes sait? How far may Darius bragge of her debait, Tane fra the stabil ouer Persia to ring! Pure Agathocles, from a law estait, Ane potteris boy, to be ane potent King! Of Justine, the suinehird, sho maid ane empriour, Ouer Constantinople ane king, and cround him thair; Gyges the gait-hird, ane michtie conquerour, To Lydia land she maid him lord and aire; And Wallancianus from his landwart fair, Tane fra the pleuch to place imperiall; Cambyses, Nero, be the contrair clair, Was thair awin burreois to thair buriall. Sa Fortoun mountit neuer man sa hie, Fostered with folie, suppose she make them faine, Bot with ane tit sho turnis the quheill, ?e sie, Doun gois their heid, vp gois their heillis againe! Of Alexander to write I war bot vaine; Ouer fifty landis he lord was, at the leist; ?it threttie dayis lay efter he was slaine, Unbureit in Babell, lyke a brutell beist. Xerxes, quhose armeis maid the riueris dry, And schippis subumbragit all the seyis on breid, Did sho not wait him with sic foule inuy, Pray to Pericles, that put him to his speid? Of Julius Cesar gif thow lykes to reid, In his triumphant toun victorious, Slaine be his Senatis, schamefully in deid, By his awin kinsmen Brutus and Cassus. Sum auld exemples heir I man induce, To bring my purpose to more speciall; Quha was mair worthie, gif I wald make ruse, More stout, more trew, nor hardy Hanniball? Danter of Romaines, to Carthage ane castell wall, The onely thing quhairin he maist reioysit; Do quhat he docht in deidis marciall, By his awin pepill petiously deposed. Sicklyk was Sipio saiklesly schot furth, That vinqueist Hanniball lyke a warriour wicht, His valiant workes was weyit bot litill worth, Quhen he was baneist with a bair gude nicht; Not lyke a captaine nor a kindly knicht, Bot lyke ane beggar baneist in exile; Sa Fortoun montit neuer man on hicht, Bot sho can law him within a litill quhyle. Alchebead of Athenis was Duke, Of princely parents and ane royall race, To keip his toun sic trauell undertuke, He maid his fo-men fle befoir his face; To his rewarde he gat nane vther grace, Ingraitly baneist, to their awin grit skaith; And Tymistocles in that samin place: By their awin burgessis thay wer baneist baith. Experience teiches me not to flyte with Fortoun, With auld examples that dois na thing belang vs; Marke James of Dowglas, present Erle of Morton, And of the best that euer was borne amang vs; Danter of theuis that dayly dois ouer-gang vs, Key of this countrie that kepit vs from skaith; I speik na farther in feir thay sould gar hang vs: Preichouris and poiettis are put to silence baith. Few things wer done bot Mortoun interprisit them, Dumbar, and Brichane, and mony vthair bloke; Speik quhat thay pleis, he wrocht them and deuisit them; He and his freindis ay formest in the flocke; He faucht ?our querrell as kein as ony cok, Reuengit ?our murthers ma nor twa or thrie; Ane nobillman and of ane ancient stoke, His valiant deidis demereitis not to die. Ane of the speciallis did mentene ?our croun, ?our ferme protectour in ?our tender ?eiris; He maid ?ow vp and all ?our fo-men doun, His marciall manheid did mentein ?our weiris; Gif he did wrang, rewarde him as effeiris; Gif he did gud, God wald he sould be tret; Bot as the prouerbe speikis, it plaine appeiris, Auld men will die, and barnes will sone for?et. Was he not rewler ouer ?our realme and rigioun, Quhill all was pacifeit be his prudent wit? Stude he not stoutly be the true religioun, Ane of the first that maid the freiris to flit? Franke on the feildis, and formest at the bit, Without respect to baggis or bodie to; ?our faithfull subiect, and sua he sal be ?it, To do gude seruice, as I haue seene him do. Than at Carbarrie hill he held a day, With litill bludeshed Bothwell was put a-bake, Quha slew ?our father and fibilly fled away, Syne socht ?ourselfe to bring this realme to sake. How mony clawbackes than, suppose thay crak, Conuenit with Mortoun quhan Bothwel tuk the chase? Try or ?e tine him, and trow not all thay spak; Lat workes beir witnes: vaine wordis sould haue na place. Sone efter that the Counsell cround ?oursell, Quhan godly Murray as a regent rang; ?it thair was some that bauldly did rebell, That to ?our lawis wald nouther ryde nor gang. Quha thair conuenit for to reuenge ?our wrang, Albeit ?our action was thocht innocent? It was the Dowglassis douchtaly them dang, And pleit ?our proces in that parliament. Quha could declare our langsum lyfe in Leith, Fechtand all day, and syne lay in our clais? Gif Lindesay lykes, that Lord can tell ?ow eith Quha was ?our friendis, or quha ?our mortall fais, Or quha gaid formest breistand vp the braies. I dar not pen the speciallis, I do plaine ?ow; Bot, weill I wait, howeuer the warld now gais, Thai find maist freindship, was fardest than again ?ow. Syne at [the] Langsyde feild ?our grace may ken, Mortoun was thair ane man amang the rest; In Striuiling toun, out of his dowie den, Maist lyke a fox thay fyrit him in his nest. In Edinburgh Castell quhair thay war possest, He them desplaced that purposit to undo ?ow. Quhan ?e grow auld, I wait ?e will confest, Mortoun hes bene ane faithfull saruand to ?ow. Quhan Regentis deit, and all the lytes inlaikit, The Counsell did conuene and set ane day; Thay cheisit him Regent in that rowme that waikit, With sad adwise, for few or nane said nay; Bot ?it I think thay playit ?our grace foule play, Gif he was knawin than of thir crymes conuict; Gif he be saikles, surely I dar say, They haue defamit him with ane fulich trick. To dant the theuis had he nocht mekill ado, Abandoned the borders that na man durst rebell? The Armestrangis, Elliottis, and the Johnestons, to, With twentie vther clans I can not tellâ During his dayis thai durst not ryde ane ell; The hirdis and hinde men in their labeis lay; Bot thair estait, as now ?e sie ?oursell, All nicht to walke, and fane to wirk all day. Aganis grit lordis committing small offence, With iniust challenge thay aucht na man to chessoun; Mortoun hes ay bene vpricht with his prince, But spot of cryme, or ony point of tressoun. Albeit gude saruice be not tane in seasoun, His workes may witnes he neuer sparit for perrell; Laitly accusit but outher ryme or ressoun, As sindrie schawis me, for a saikles querrell. Daft fulis defyis him because thay finde him sage, And cowartis contrarious for his hardiment; Young men for glaikrie can not agrie with age, And waisteris inuyis him for his gouernement. And sacreit counsell can not be content To suffer lordshippis in equalitie; ?it I beseik ?our grace, of gude intent, To play the prince but parcialitie. Adwise ?ow weill, sen he hes not offendit; To keip sic senattis it sall decore ?our land; Of rasche decreitis cums rew and may not mend it, As Scottismens wisdome dois behinde the hand. Wyse lordis are ill ta make, I vnderstand, And crewelty in kingis is to abhorre: This sempill counsall, syr, is na command, Bot wald to God that na man louit ?ow war. Finis, quod Sempill.

Heir followis The Legend of the Bischop of St Androis Lyfe, callit Mr Patrik Adamsone, alias Cousteane.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Preface. All fay?full brether that on the Lord dependis, Mark weill this schedule that I have send you heir, Pestiferus prelatis that Papistrie pretendis, Sic dewils but dout sall in o? dayis appeir; Yit God forwairns you, be the weidis they weir, To ken the lupus in a lamb skyn lappit, Makand thair gode of warldlie gudis and geir, The flock new foundit, and they in furringis happit. Veneriall pasto???, in vomiting thair fay?, Lyk to ane tyke return?g to it agane, Filling thair purses with the spirituall grathe, Plucking the pellotis or ever the scheip be slane, Goddis true preceptis and preiching to prophane, Layand thair cuires in warldlie busines: Thir are the propheitis, I speik it to you plane, Coverit with coule of clockit holines. Lyk to the scrybes, closing the yeattis of heawin, Sayand the Pope sic power to thame gave; Hyding the keyis was trulie to th? gewin, Thinking y? Christians shall na entres have. A scabbit scheip wald fane infect the lave, Causing seditione into the kirk to ryse. Heirfoir, bewar what sermond ye resave: In rottin bosses no balme liquor lyes. To Bischop Balaam, brecking the law of God, They may succeid weill as his sone and air; Or Corah, Dathan, reving Aarons rod, With thair vsurped preisthood playit no mair. To Amasias I may th? weill c?pair, Sleayand the fay?full flock w?out offences; Tane and incarcerat, kepit heir and there, Beggit and banist, bearing the wraith of princes. In Maccabeis wha ever lykis to luike, By Alchimas and Jason they may leir, Mensuorne byschops that Moses law forsuike, Ren?cing God for warldlie gudis and geir, With Kingis vnchristned c?and to the weir, Contrair thair c?sci?ce and their kyndlie freindis. What dois our bischops now, may I no? speir? Servandis to Sathan for his takkis and teindis. I may c?pair th? to a painted fyre, But heit to warm you in the winteris cauld; Or to a visorne cled with trym attyre, Covering a skyn vncomlie to behald. The plesant plane-trie will the leavs vnfauld With fairest schaddow to save the sone in s?merâ Be thir lait bischops may this teall be tauldâ Beirand no fruite bot barren blockis of tymber. Vntruethfull teachers, in thir tymes bypast, Some hes bene sene from yeir to yeir; Bot in this latter aige they flock so fast, That I beleive in deid the day be neir. Judas Iscariot, for a gleib of geir, Betrayed his Maister lyk a trayto? tod. Annas and Caiphas, gif they both war heir, Culd doe no mair to slea the sanctis of God. Blind Baals bischops, provocking God to yire, Your sinfull leaving hes the scheip oversyled; Compared to swyne return?g to the myre, In thair awin filthes to get thair fames defyled. Albeit they be now Tulchin bischops stylit, Having proude kingis and co?sallis to decoir th?, Auld God is God, and will not be begylit, When Plutois palice beis provydit for them. May Scotland beir sic bischops for the gallous, St Androis, Glasgou, for y? gait anes grantit; What have ye lost? forloppen, leying fellowes, Fraudulent fellowes, that tuyse there fay? rec?ted. The spreit of God was anes into th? planted, Preiching his doctrine, as indeid they did, But, fra they gat the drapping grise they wanted, Thair clocked knaverie culd no moir be hid. Vngratious guydis, y? God hes never anoynted Lyk to our fay?full pasto??? past befoir, But be the devile, I dout not, heir appoyntit, Godis holie scripto? for to cloik and smoir. For no rewarde they work but warldlie gloir, Plaing âplaceboâ into princes faces; With leys and letters doing thair devoir, Pynand true preicho??? for to possess there places. Voratious woulfis, I wish you to rewolk, Ere in the den of darkness ye most lye; Of Godis true mercies, lyk to mercat focke, Selling for lucre, quha so lykis to by; Libidinous dr?ckardis they dowe no? to denye; May no m? had th? be thair yeis and nayis. Thir are the propheitis, planelie ye may espye, The Lord called lyers in the latter dayis. Thair maister, Pluto, hes there spreitis possest, Who with his Lord in lyk c?tritione fell; Thinkand his wit and beautie by the rest, Against the word of God he wald rebell. Through his pres?ptous pryde he past to hell, Leaving the heavinlie harbrie whair he satt. Gif they repent no? sone, assure they sall Receave sic mercie as thair maister gat. This Adamsone may weill be borne of Eve, Takand hir vices of his wicked mother; Likkest to father Adam, I beleive, Surpassing Cain cursed, or ony vther: For he slew nothing bot his onlie brother; And this hes drowned hole dioceis, ye sie. Wanting the grace, when he shuld guyde the ruther, He lattis his scheip tak in at luife and lie. Reforme thair faythis gif they be found astray, From thair vocatione cleane degenerat; Preis not to enter be the wrangous way, As bastard brethrene, being reprobat; With hart c?treit, and handis elevat, Seik thair salvatione of the samyn sort; They will not find the father obstinat, When synners knocke, in casting vp the port. Heirfore, deir Brethrene, I wish you to bewar: Sen ye are wairned, I wald not ye were blekkit; To thair deceatfull doctrine come no? nar, Singand lyk syrens to deceave the elected; Both art and part of Papistrie suspectit, As ye may see be thair workis inventit. To Edinburgh baillies my buike salbe directed, Desyrand lycence to gett live to prent it. Ground you on God, the rocke and corner stane, As Paull dois speik to the Corrinthians. Swa live thir lyars and thair lawis allane, Packand thair penche lyk Epicurians; Contrair to Christ lyk Antichristians; The plane polluters of his holie t?ple; Lyk to Scrybes and fals Pharisians; Bellie god bischops: Quoth your brother Semple. A Lenvoye. Now, paper, pass; and gif they speir who send the, Tell thame, a true m? bay? to King and Croun. Curious poyetis, I knawe, will vilipend the, Saying, thou fares but of ane saucie lowne. Yit, with the rascall people vp and downe, Finding our freindis, c?fess to be myne, From the New Castle c?ing to this towne: Concluding this, we toome a tass of wyne. The Legend or Discourss of the Lyfe and C?versatione and Qualiteis of the Tulchene Bischope of Sanctandrois. Set furth by R. S. To all and sundrie be it sene, Mark weill this mater quhat I meine, The legend of a lymmeris lyfe, Our Metropolitane of Fyffe; Ane schismatyke, and gude swyne hogge, Come of the tryb Gog Magoge; Ane elphe, ane elvasche incubus, Ane lewrand lawrie licherous, Ane fals, forloppen, fenyeit freir, Ane r?ungard for greid of geir; Still daylie drinckand or he dyne, A wirriare of the gude sweit wyne; Ane baxters sone, ane beggar borne, That twyse his surname hes mensworne; To be called C?stene he tho? schame: He tuke vp C?stantine to name. Some to the schoolis this knave c?voyes; Beggand his breid amonges the boyes, He come to letters at the lenth; Then, when he grew to witt and strength, He tuike the ministrie on hand, And servit at Syres vp a land. Bot, through pres?ptious height and pryde, He layed that office sone asyde; Manna and quales he tho? no fude, The pottis of Egypt was tuyse as gude. Thinking that poore professione vaine, He changed his surname over agane; Now Docto? Adamsone at last. Whairthrow he ower to Paris past As pedagoge to young M'Gill, Imploying ay his spreit to ill. To lerne disceat and subtile sawis, He studeis long tyme in the lawis; Ilk day devysing sindrie wylis, Not ane nor tua that he beguyles: Thair was no Scotism? dwelland thair Bot he deceaved them les or mair: Maitland, Melwill, and Matchevellous, Learned never mair knaifrie in a scholehous; Which tua resembles, as I suppone, Achitophell, and fals Triphone. Then finding out ane new fas cast, Amongis the prentars is he past, And promeist to set foorth a buike. Grit sowmes of money from them he tuike; Bot Bacchus, and the bordall toe, Maid him sic busines adoe, That he my? gett na buikis c?pyld; And sua the prentars were beguyld. Now Holyglass, return?g hame, To play the sophist thought no schame; Through sindrie realmes tho? he had ranged, Yit nathing in his maners changed. Men heiring tell how Lowrie landit, The c?gregatione him c?mandit To serve a kirk and keip a cure. Persaving thair professione pure, He tho? it but ane vaine vocatione. He thristed, ane easiare occupatione, Amongis the lawers for to lyve; Bot fra that rang not in his sleyve, He wald with thame no mair remane, Bot maid him for the court agane. The erle of Lennox, levand then, Our regent, and a worthie man, Vnto his brother h? directed, With secreit earrandis vnsuspectit, For pois to pay his men of weir; Bot how, alace! as ye shall heir, Betrayed thame bay? with a tryme c?voy. Makand his bargand with a boy, Was ower to Flaunders fled and ferreit, Cryand out, harmesay! he was herreat, Lam?ting sair his losse and skayth, And this gait he beguylit thame bay?: Bot yet with tyme his trickis were tryed; He had nea toung for to denye it. Than, gif he had not fled for feir, Gude Matchewell had mist his meir. To tell how he bestowit his poise, The faice is weill sene on his noise; For, be his craig, ye may weill ken Gif he be ane of Bacchus men. Than, when he had na vther vaine, He maid him for the kirk againe; Bot for to tell what text he tuike, Dysertis Duschet was the buike; And maid ane sermone, some confydis, To pleso? fock on bayth the sydis. His mynd was mair on heich promotione, Groundit on geir, nor gude devotione, Without respect of true religione, As we have manie in this regione. Yit in the pulpet we saw him greit, Playand the publict hypocreit; Then men, beholding his c?tritione, Beleavand he had changit c?ditione. Then through to Paislay he was send, Lascivous maners for to amend. What fruite come of his ganging thair? Sic preist, sic pariche: what suld mair? For, neather with preiching nor w? reiding, Tuke he that faythless flock in feiding; Bot meit in campo did c?mand them, And left th? ffarre war nor he fand them. To tell you quhat this c?po meins, Thair daylie to the drink c?veins The obstinat papistis of the toun; This pasto? with his scheip sat doun, Bot maid no work, I mak you plane, To bring the lost scheip bak agane. To copowt c?plene there he calld thame, But never findis whair he forbade thame Thair vglie aithis abhominable. They finding him so favorable, They thankat God that they had f?d him. Ecce qu? bon? et qu? jucund? Est habitare fratres in un?! Freir Jhonstoun and Maquhane about him, Tua pallartis that the Pope professis, Rysing at mydnycht to there messis; Vidi, scivi, sed non audiebam, Potum mer? c? fletu miscebam, Carruse, and hald the c?nikin clinking; Yit wha ware there to sie thair drinking, They hald it still vp for a mocke, How Maister Patrik fedd his flock. Then to the court this craftie lown To be a bytescheip maid him boun; Becaus St Androis then dependit, To heich promotione he pretendit. The kirk began to tak suspitione, Then knawing weill the knaifis c?ditione, They callit him into thair assemblie, Bot not so welcome thair as hamelie. Grit oethes he sweirs, w? feinyit face, That he suld never inioy that place; And bad thame hald him vnsuspect, He was not gewin to that effect. Bot better packet afternone, The foullest turne that ever was done, Ben ower the barr he gave a brocht, And laid among them sic a lochet, With eructavit cor me?, He hosted thair a hude full fra him; For laik of rowme, that rubiature Bespewit vp the moderator; While the assemblie thocht grit schame, Saying he was seik, and send him hame; And laid him backwardis in a bed, But not so weill nurtorit as fed. Sone efter that, inc?tin?t, Erle of Mortoun gat the regim?t, Then sett he to, with saill and ayre, To seik some lowner harbore thayre, And caist his anckers on the raid, And long tyme with the lord abaid. His towes, I find, hes bene so fyne, For all the stormes hes bene sensyne, His schip come never on the schalde, But stak still on the ancker halde. His office daylie was, indeid, The chapter to expone and reid. When he that sermone celebrat, He had a worde accustomat: âThe propheit meins this, gif ye mark it;â Auld Captane Kirkburne to him harkit, Perceaving weill St Androis vaikit, And syne how sone the knave was staikit, âTo all men levand he c?plenis; I watt now what the propheit menis.â This foirsaid bischope beand deid, Maister Ihone W?rome was maid heid, For sowmes of silwer that he had lent th?; Bot he besoght thame to c?tent th?: He cravit na digniteis prophane, But his awin silver hame agane. Fra Holiglass sone hard this thing, He toned his dussie for a spring, And held the Regent so in hand, And maid him weill to vnderstand That he sould pay the foirsaid sowme, Gif he were enterit in the rowme; And mair, as he wald bid him doe, To give his servantis pensiones toe. Sua, with his craft, this carlingis pett Hes fangit ane grit fisch in his nett. Bot fra he was a byschope stylit, M? Jhone Wyndrome was beguylit, Had he no? had a sure probatione, And cald him on his obligatione. Bot Docto? Patrik still replyed, With trickis and delatouris he denyed, And maid manifest to men of law That he had his discharge to schaw. Bot how this discharge was gotten! When Holieglass is deid and rotten, His smaikrie sall nocht be forgett, How Docto? Patrik payit his debt. Ane new c?ceat this knaif hes tane; To Willie Vylie he hes gane, The Regents awin cubicular, His servant and his secretare, And him besought to lat him see Off missive wrytingis tuo or thrie, Fra Maister Jhone Wydrome to my Lord, And hecht him crownes for to accord. This simple boy, suspecting nocht, Thrie of the wrytingis to him brought; Ane of thame law subscryvit, ye ken, As custome is to noble men: He cutted off the bill abone, And filled the blank with falset sone, Dischargine him the foirsaid sowmes. It c?and in the Sessiones thowmes, To Maister Wyndrome they c?pleanet, Wha swair that he had never sene it, And tuike in hand for to impryve it. Thair Matchewell had bene mischevit, Were not his falsett was c?fesst, And sic a moyen with him dresst; Five h?dreth merkis he to him gave, And tuik in hand to pay the leave, At certane dayis, thair was no doubt; Bot, fra he fand the tyme ryn out, He pat him off with mowis and mockis, And had no will to louse the boxe. The superintendent saw na better, Bot raid agane, and raist a letter, And gat the harlat to the horne. Bot Howliglass, lang or the morne, New falsat forged out for to defend him: Ane fair suspentione he hes send him. The vther to the Sessione pleinyeit, And said it was both fals and feinyeit, And socht inspectione for impriving. The lymmer, feiring lyfe and leving, He saw na bute but bagis to louse, And swoir he maid it but in mowis, As Maister Andro Wilsoune wrocht it, And secreitlie said he forthoght it; Beseikand him to keip it close, Or word ran to the c?mon woice. The vther wald na mair reprive him, But all men he forbade beleive him, Or ever to trow ane word he spak, But Holiglass behind thair back. So in Sanctandrois happened then Ane callit Scot, a mareit man, Nocht verie riche in worldlie guddis, Save tuo pure aikers of borrow ruddis; Yit with the glaikis he was owergane, And in adulterie he was tane; Maid to be punissit for his paik; But he was stubburne in his talk; Iniurit the elders, what suld mair? This bischop, beand present thair, Desyrit him hame, and he suld seay Gif he culd lerne him to obey; For all his crackis, doe what he can To knaw the law of God and man. Sua to his castell tuik him hame: This duble drunckerd thought no schame; Foorth secreitlie he callis him syne, And fillit him fow with aill and wyne; Persuading him to sell his land, And gat his letters in his hand. This beand done, as I have said, Vpon his duschet vpe he played, Gevand the man so mony terro???, That brocht him in a thousand erro???, That for his lyfe was no remeid, Gif he abaid the law, but deid. The pure m?, being fleid for feir, Gave him the land, and gat na geir; Maid sayle syne to the Easter sees, And, lyk ane dyver, thair he deis. Whairto this bischop tuik reguard, And enterit sone to Naboths yaird. The sillie wedew a quhyle defendit, But scho grew pure, and so scho endit, And left hir malisone, c?sider, To Lowrie, and the land together. Whidder hir malisone tuike effect, Or gif it was the gude wyne sect, Or surfesting of sundrie spyces, Or then a scurge for clockit vyces; Bot sic ane seiknes hes he tane, That all men trowit he had bene gaine; For leitches my? mak no remeid: Thair was na bute to him bot deid. He seing weill he wald not mend, For Phetanissa hes he send, With sorcerie and incantationes, Reasing the devill with invocationes, With herbis, stanes, buikis and bellis, Menis m?bers, and south rinn?g wellis; Palme croces, and knottis of strease, The paring of a preistis auld tees; And, in principio, sought out syne, That vnder ane alter of stane had lyne, Sanct Jhones nutt, and the fo?? levit claver, With taill and mayn of a baxter aver, Had careit hame heather to the oyne, Cutted off in the cruik of the moone; Halie water, and the l?ber beidis, Flyntworthe, and fourtie vther weidis: Whairthrough the charm?g tuik sic force, They laid it on his fatt whyte horse. As all men saw, he sone deceissit: Thair Saga slew ane saikles beast. This wald not serve: he sought ane vther, Ane devill duelling in Anstruther, Exceading Circes in c?ceattis, For chaungene of Wlisses meatis: Medusas craftis scho culd declair, In making eddars of hir hair: Medeas practicques scho had plane, That could mak auld men young agane, By Achates, the witches god. Mercurius, with his charmed rod, The aunci?t King of Bactria, That first inventit magica, Could not so weill of stowen geir tell, As could this vglie hund of hell. With this the word yead through the toun, How lurcan Lowrie played the lowne. Heiring how witches wrang abusit him, The Kirkmen calld him and accused him, And scharplie of theis pointis reproved him; That he in sorcerie beleavit him, Whairthrough his saule my? come to skay?. The witche and he c?nfessing bayth Scho tuike some part of white wyne dreggis, Wounded rayne, and blak hen eggis, And maid him droggis that did him gude. His ansr. being rashe and rude: âSuppoise the devill maid that graith, The seiknes sua ouersett my fayth, At that tyme, to asswage my sair, I wald have tane it, I tauld thame thair:â Then did the elders him desyre, Vpon the morne, to mak a fyre, To burne the witches both to deid; Bot or the morne he fand remeid. He dred sa sair they suld have schawin How his knaverie was to th? vnknawin; Laich in a lymbus, whair they lay, Then Lowrie lowsit th? long or day, And had no will they were corrected; Yit with the people he was suspected, Trowing the teallis befoir was spocken, Becaus they saw no presone brocken. There was his pretticques weill espyed, But with his ansr. he replyit, And said, na man, at his c?mand, Wald tak the presone hous in hand; Into that d?geon was sic din, As Beel?ebub had bene therin, That never a man durst stire q?? day; And sua he neckit thame with nay, And brocht the teale bravelie about, How Pluto come and pullit th? out. Yit few or nane this Lowrie beleavit, Becaus they culd not get it previt: They prayit him to amend his lyfe, And trow na witchcraft in a wife. For oght the kirk culd him forbid, He sped him sone, and gat the thrid; Ane carling of the Quene of Phareis, That ewill win geir to elphyne careis. Through all Braid Abane scho hes bene On horsback, on Hallow ewin; And ay in seiking, certayne nyghtis, As scho sayis, with our sillie wychtis; And names out ny?bo??? sex or sewin, That we belevit had bene in heawin. Scho said scho saw thame weill aneugh, And speciallie gude auld Balcleuch, The secretare, and sindrie vther; Ane William Symsone, hir mother brother, Whome fra scho hes resavit a buike, For ony herb scho lykis to luike: It will instruct hir how to tak it; In sawis and sillubs how to mak it; With stones that mekle mair can doe, In leich craft, whair scho layis them toe. A thowsand maladeis scho hes m?dit. Now being tane and apprehendit, Scho, being in the bischops cure, And kepit in his castell sure, Without respect of warldlie glamer He past into the witchis chalmer, Closing the dure behind his bak, And quyetlie to hir he spak, And said his work lome was no? worthe: Lowsing his poyntis he laid it furth. Scho sayned it with hir halie hand, The pure pith of the pryo??? wand: To help that raipfull scho hes rest him, Whairfore, ye say, my ladie left him. For scho had sayned it tuyss or thrise, His rubigo began to ryiss: Then said the bischop to Jhone Bell, Goe, tak the first seye of hir yo?sell. The witche to him hir weschell gave, The Bischops blissing to resave. What dayis of pardone then scho wan! The relicques of that holie man Micht save hir saule from purgatorie. His wyfe, c?ceaving jelowsie, Cryed out his deid when it was done, Ran through the tovne, and tauld it sone. Ane syiss was socht sone to the wyfe, Whairas ane aunci?t laird of Fyiffe, Of gude report, that may be trowit, Befoir this Bischope weill awowit, Eather at Semblie or at Sessione, As he wha hard the wyffis c?fessione, That this was suirlie thair proceiding. Whair sic men gettis a flock in feeding, The sillie scheip wilbe devorit, And Goddis true doctrine daylie smorit. This beand done, he thocht sic shame, He my? not tarie weill at hame, But ower to Edinburgh he hes past, Procured a licence, at the last, To ryde to Londoun with a letter, Becaus they culd not get a better. Wist ye what his c?missione bure, He my? weill serve for sic a cuire. Sic lipps, sic lattouce; lordis and lownes: Auld creased workis payit w? crackit crownes. Bot heir I will no mair remane, Return?g to my text agane. It may not be no mair forborne, How he beguylit pure David Horne, Ane honest man, ane messinger, And was St Androis pensioner. To all the Bischops thair befoir He doing daylie his devoir, He gat allowance, being leill, Ane pensione of a chalder of meill. Our to this Bischop now is he gane; His letter of tak hes with him tane, Sayand, âye man be gude, my Lord, And to yo? man misericord. This angle noble in my neife Vnto yo? Lordschip I will gife, To cause you to renew my tackis.â The vther little answer makis. The Angle noble first he tuike, And syne the letters for to luike: With y? his byknyfe furth hes tane, And maid him tu?tie tackis of ane; In litle crownes began to cut them; The vther gaid hame backwards but them, Sichand, and durst say no mair, And left his angle noble thair. With thir, and mony sic lyke trickis, The haill co?trie this loun c?victis. The pure men plentis y? duellis besyde him, How he creipis in a hoill to hyde him, And barris them fast w?out the yettis, When they come there to crave thair debtis; For kaill, candle, and knocked beir, Herbis to the pot, and all sic geir, He never payis ane p?ny he takkis. To heir the mone the pure folk makkis, What malisones are to him gevin, Cryand, âa wengance from the hewin Come doun on this deceatfull Lowrie!â I wald not for all the carse of Gowrie To be a bischop in his esteat; To heir, when he gangis throw the gait, How everie wyfe on vther puttis, Bidding the bischop pay for his guttis, And cryes, âgar pay me for my eall,â Ane vther for candle, the thrid for caill; The fourt cryis out for knocked beir; âHow dar this dastard had our geir? A vengeance fall his fein?it fay?, For poinding of the pure folkis graith!â Efter my Lord this larowme ringis For this and mony sic lyk thingis. Suppose it stude on all thair lyffis, He will not get amonges the wyffes Ane pynt of aill in all the tovne, Except the silver be laid doun. Then gif ye knew his duble tackis Amonges the co?trie men he mackis, With feinyeit seillis and antideatis, And tuentie vther tryme c?ceatis, Setting the co?trie be the earis, And takis no tho? of ny?bo??? weiris, So he be sure to fill his hand, How mekle blood be in the land. Gif siclyk bischops be admittit, Grit God and all the warld sall wit it; This makis his trickis, his feinyeit toyes, What clocked knaverie he c?voyes, His wattir drincking, his seiknes feinyeit, Fearand the kirk shuld on him pleinyeid. It c?es to licht now, at the last, Fra tyme the ministers are past, The trick of Guisians devysit, He hes bene ane to interpryse it; Ane waikryfe devill daylie to wirk, To saw seditione in the kirk, Learn?g a lessone at ald Frogmortene, As he c?fessit at his departing. To co?terfute that fals c?ceat, And speik the Quenis Grace be the gait, He fand his seiknes was so sair Throw all his bodie heir and thair, That nathing my? his panes repell, Except it were some sacred well In Lorane, or the well of Spaa; But his c?missione na man saa: Which text c?tenit na vther thing, Bot c?mendationes fra our kyng Vnto the Quene of Englandis Grace, Beseikand hir to help his case, And to send new support againe him. âMortone,â sayis he, âthe lawis hes slaine him, And Gowrie hes gottin a c?digne syse, Conform?g to his interpryse, With sindrie vtheris that loves thair factione, That daylie dois menteane y? actione, As Anguse, Mar, and Maister of Glames; Tak thir thrie for na saikles lambes, But proude ambitious bangesters, With some seditious ministers, C?tempneris of our authoritie, Subscryvit aganist our Maiestie, For to destroy our realme and regione, Without respect of true religione; Beleivand we shuld bring hame the mess. Luke what religione ye profess; I salbe b?de therby to byde: Under grit God ye salbe guyde, My tutrix in my tender yeiris, Sen none in earth to me so deir is As ye, my kyndlie cusines. Gif I had gritter bussines, I think ye aucht for to defend me With succo?, and support to send me. To bring this mater to ane end, My sacred bischop I have send, As Semple sayis, ane subtile tod, To bring me hame the word of God From Italie and Almainie; In Geneva and Germanie To seik the trew experi?ce For libertie of c?science. Give ye think gud, I hald it best That bay? our realmes my? live in rest.â With this and vther siclyk wairis, Befoir the co?sall he declairis A fals, deceatfull, feinyeit taill, Bot alwayis for thair awin availl. Bot yit, or he bound to the read, How y? his packm?tie was maed, I think it best for to declair. His blew clock beand worne so bair, He causit an talyeo? turne it and mak it Into wich maill: a frind he packit it, His sarkis, his schone, his ganging gowne, Ane fitt case for a feinyeit lowne. Na dentie geir this Doctor seikis; Of tottis russet his ryding breikis; Ane hamelie hat; a cott of kelt Weill beltit in ane lethrone belt; A bair clock, and a bachlane naig; His ruffe curfufled about his craig; The one end to his belt hang doun; The vther stude above his crovne. Thair was a brave embassado? Befoir so noble ane audito?, The Quene of Englandis Maiestie, Hir co?sall, and nobilitie, In hir tryvmphand palice placit. May sic fellowis be defacit! Alace! that Scotland had no schame, To send sic howfing carles from hame! Now o? embassado? is boune With bag and bagage off the toun: All ny? in Seytoun he remaned, Whair wyne and aill was nothing hayned; And fra my Lord he gat a letter, To cause him to be treat the better, To Monsier, to mak him speid, The Frenche embassado? indeid, That daylie yit in Londoun lyis, Wha can ane evill turne weill devise; And syne to Berwick on the morne, Whair all men leuch my Lord to scorne. Na mulettis there his cofferis careis, Bot lyk a court of auld cashmareis, Or cadyers c?ing to ane fair; And yit some honest men gaid thair For fewis and takkis y? he sic sett thame, Beleivand in y? towne to get thame, Bot may gaip lang or he get them: As they have sped, ye may speir at them. Tuiching his awin tryne, ye shall heir: The Vicar of Dunbuge on a meir, That wonder weill can turne a can, A ganeand maister for sic a man, With vthere fellowis tuo or thrie; Gude Robert Melwene of Carnebie I shuld not racken in with thea: Of honest men he had na mea. But he may ruse him of his ryding, In Londoun for his longsome byding. Thair Holieglas begane his gaidis, As he was learned, amangis the laidis. To Maist: Hanam sone he past, And sowmes of silver fra him ast In borrowing, while he come bak. The man, beleivand it he spak, Vnto this sophist sone c?sentit; But he had efterward repentit, Were not a man amongis th? sell, Whose c?science causit him to tell; And quyetlie his co?sall gave him, That Holieglas wald sone deceave him. The man, perceaving it was sua, Gave him the gek, and lute him gea, Thankand his God and gud men baith For his delyvering of y? skeath. O Holyglas! thought thou no schame, And thou but laitlie come frome hame? Vpon the secund day at morrow Suld our embassado? gea borrow, And want or ever he wyn ower Tweid? Bot, God be praisit, he come no speid. To Londoun Lowrie tuke the geat, With traine my? staik for his esteat; His wantone vicare on a meir; Twa vther fellowis to turse his geir; Bot never ane honest man had he, Save Robert Melwene of Carnebie, That with that bischop went about, To sett his feinyeit falsett out; Bot als gude he had sittin ydle, As there ower land to leid his brydle, Considering what reward he gatt. Still on his owne cott taill he satt, As shalbe tauld you or we tuyne, In loco quo it shall come in. To tell all ludgene whair he lay, And ay on be the brek of day, Wald be ower langsome to collect: I wilbe breif in that respect. Bot yit the menstrallis and the bairdis, Thair trowand to obtene rewardis, About his ludgene loudlie played; Bot menstrallis, serving man, and maid, Gat Mitchell in ane auld pocke nucke; Save dira adew his leive he tuik; Then be the gait with murmo? passis, âAllace! I haue forgot the lasses! Bot yit they shall not want a plak, Will God give I returne abak.â This was to cloik his waine c?ceat For he come home ane vther gait; As Culen Kyngis that Christ adorned, Per aliam viam he returned. In Londone he ane ludgene tuike, A inkeiper, ane c?mone cuike, Ane tapster bay? of aill and wyne, That weill my? staik for sic a tryne. Vnto the court the word is gane, That he had sic ane ludgene tane. Little they said, what ever they thought. Vnto this bischop there was brought Ane new-maid coische for to decore him, Ane serving gentlem? send for him, That stude ane lang ho? at his yeatt, Or he could ony entres geatt, While he was grathed into his geir Siclyke as he was wont to weir, As I befoir have specifeit, And Maister Willie will verefeit. The man that was his messinger, The Quenis Grace Latin secretare, Being eschamit fra ever he saw him, Said to himself, âa vengeance faa him! Is this our brave embassado?, Whome to we doe sic hono?, That I am send for to hir Graceâ A bewe bust in a bischops place?â Yit in the cosche he lap at last. Into the palice are they past, Which callit is the fair White hall; His pintle against the palice wall Puld out to piss, and wald no? spair, Which is a thing inhibit thair. Ane porter sone did him persave, And to the bischop his blissing gave, Betuixt the schoulders a royall route, Turn?g him wodderschins about. To scape the fray he was so fane, He put vp club in scheith agane. C?ing to presence of the Quene, Becaus he had not sic thingis seine, He wist not weill how to behave him, But as some vthers co?sall gave him; And that was of a semple sort, As I can tell by true report Of gentlemen that stude besyde him, That he had na mair grace to guyde him Nor it had bene ane hieland quow, Lurcane and lowring, I wat not how. Then his c?missione being red, Out of the palice he was sped, Then to the wall agane gois he To pischâhis part of honestie. The portars publictlie reprovit him, And doubtles they had thair mischevit him, Were not the gentle men excused him, And thame forbade to stryke a stranger. He beand scapit of that danger, Hame through he past, and wald not spair: They maid a midwyfe of him thair. They bring thame farre on ?beling foiles, Bot send thame hame throw on thair soilles. Tuo moneth he tareit efter that, But never presence agane he gat. With bischops he began to fleich, Desyring licence for to preich. Of his auld sermon he had perqueir, Bot they had never hard thame heir. Of omnigatherine now his glose: He maid it lyk a Wealchm? hose: Tempora mutantur was his text. The bischops vicar being vext, To ruse his maister, and set him out, Sayand to thame y? stude about, âGif ye his preiching could persave, My maister is a lerned knaif:â Placebois part, behind his bak, Vnto the people this he spak. The preiching done, the chapter red, They baith gaid fow aneuch to bed. This poysoned preicheo? of Godis word Is not vnlyk ane suple suord; For in the fyire when ye have heat it, To ony syde you lyk to sett it, It will go worth, and stand therto, So will this duble docto? doe. For greid of geir, and warldly graith, On baith the gaitis he gr?dis his fayth. For daylie we may se his dress, When Monseir gaid vnto his mess, Into ane gallerie neir besyde; Thair wald this halie bischope byde, Saying, forsuith, it was not smittell. I think he weyit the mater litle How mony messis there was done, Sa he were packed weill at none: For daylie thair he gaid to dyne, To gett his fill of gude white wyne. The denner done, he wald not spair, Downe to a house, tuo myle and mair, To Lambeth, bischope of Canterberrie, Vpon his feit, but not be ferrie; For archness to had in a grote, He had no will to fie a bote; Bot or he come neir hand the yeatt, Vpon ane dyke doun was he sett Into a secreit out of sicht, And sat thair till his schone wes dicht. He gave thame leive to dicht his schone; To sponge his cloak durst not be done. It hurt the woole, and wrought it bair, Puld off the mottes, and did no mair: He had na will to weir his cleathis. Then to that bischop in he geas. With mony flattering taill and fals He held that bischop in the hals, Seiking the secreit of his wittis, And ay besydis he fillis his guttis, Wachting the wyne, for it was wicht. Then, when this turne cott tuke gude ny?, Half way hameward vp the calsay, Said to his servandis for a quha say, âAlace! the porter is foryett;â But sorrow mair the men my? gett. Then to a sowters chope he past, And for a pair of schone he ast. Bot or he sperit the price to pay th?, His thovmbis was on the soillis to say them; Then with his knockles he on them knockit; Eftir that he had long time blockit, With grit difficultie he tuik thame, And pat thame on: ewill mocht he bruik them! With Monsier then he moyen maid, Lam?ting sair his lang abaid, Thinking to borrow a hundreth pundis, And oblist him for to be bund To pay or he past off the toun. The vther, na dowt, had laid it downe, Were not bechance he had a man, That with his maister roundit than: âMy Lord, I kend yone lowne in Parise; He weill betydis that sometymes careis; Ane c?digne docto? to all lownes, My mother lent him fyftene crownes; Besydis some vtheris, nychbo??? thair, Some lent him less, some lent him mair. Work what we will, it was in vaine, We culd nevir gett a grote agane.â The vther said nothing for schame, But held his toung while he turned hame. Ten pundis stirling furth he tuike, And knit it in a neapkyn nucke, Saying: âforsuith, I have no mair Now at this present I may spair.â But when he gettis y? geir agane, Thair will na river ryse for raine; And, peitie, porter of hellis yeattis, That day this docto? payis his debtis. This wald not serve his turne, he tho?; Some vther moyen sone he socht. The Scottis merchandis were lyand thair, I find he maid thair baggis all bair, And promised, vnder pane of schame, To pay so sone as he come hame. Bot as he payit, ye may speir, Gif Gilbert Donaldsone were heir; Or Patrik Quhyt, he weill can tell, Sayand thair is no devill in hell Could find sic falset for to deceave him, As he, when ever he come to crave him. Ane vther Lunden paik he playit, Sending some letters, as he said, With Patrik Quhyte, as he declairis, Bearing the wecht of grit effairis, To come in Scotland to the King. The man mensueris he saw sic thing. Suppose the teale be fals and feinyeit, Yit to the Kingis Grace he hes pleinyeit. Havand the court at his c?mand, He gart the pure m? leave the land: For all the fyve bairnes and the wyffe, This Metropolitane of Fyiffe Is enterit on his hous and geir; But how this happened ye sall heir, Thought it be tedious for to tell. The m? duellis in St Androis sell: He lent this lowne thrie hundreth marke, Bot when he craveth Cok his clerk, He culd not find ane vther gait, Bot fred him with this fals c?ceat. Gif this be weill, the warld shall ken, To raise sic schiftis on saikles men. Than Robert Melwin, hame to gang, On his awin charges lyand lang, Sayand, âthis burgh I may not bruik,â His precept of pensione furth he tuike, Biddand my Lord subscryve ane letter, And swa he did, but not the better. Hame to the prowest it was directit; But ye shall heir whow he was geckit. Hame to the prowest when he past, It greived him, and he was agast; Who tuke him by the lap and lewch: âYe ken his knaverie weill aneuche. Of all his teyndis, both meill and beir, I have discharges for a yeir. He gart me pay thame or I ledd thame:â The vther tuke thame vp and redd thame. He sayned him, but he said no mair: Tak up his Londone wsayage thair. Ane burges m? there beand bound, Having a trvme schop in the toun, Vnto this Bichope sone he socht To get a licence, gif he mocht, For fortie last of Inglis beir; Said: âten pund Stirveling I have heir, And mair, when misteris, you c?mand.â The Bischop tuke it weill on hand: To Secretare Welschingame gois he, The pearle and flowre of courtasie; With signito? in neif alreddie, He send him to his Soverane Ladie For fourtie last of Englis beir: Bot what ane leesing maid he heir! He said, to serve his house at hame, But it was sauld in want of schame, And not with him that he began; He happened on ane vther man, And tuentie pund Stirveling fra him tuke: The first merchant he cleane forsuike, Gave him the geck, and lat him gea: Gud threttie pundis he c?queist sea. Amongis the Bischopis of the towne, He played the beggar vp and downe, Without respect of honestie, Or office of embassadrie. Ane scaffing warlot, wanting schame, Thrie of thair haiknes he tuik hame. He beggit buikis, he beggit bowis; Tacking in earnest, asking in mowes; As Maister Jhone Dowglass weill can tell, How slealie he deceavit him sell; Borrowing ane coffer to keip his claythis, Bot with this baggage hame he geas. This turne cott now return?g bak, Trowand some great reward to tak; Bot Englis men are not so daft Bot they perceaved his clocked craft. They knew him for a sembling baird, Whome to they wald give no rewarde; Considering as he sett him furth, They gave him mair then he was worthe. Seing his copburde come to nocht, Tua leathering bosses he hes bought. âThay will not brek albeit they fall: Thir strapis of trie destroyis vs all; They brek so mony, I may no? byde it:â Heir all the inspraich he provydit. Return?g hame, as ye hard tell, He baid behind a day him sell, The simple servantis to beguyle, Sayand, he wald ride furth a whyle, To seay a bow that was s?thing wicht, Syne come agane and tak gud nycht; Bot on lap he and went to wair. Fairweill: adewe: they gat na mair. Gif this be honest, ye may ken, And, namelie, to sic honest men, Our Legat Lord in primacie, Besydis, his grit embassadrie To vse swa in vncouth places. Litle merwell in t?porall cases He had na will to give reward, That to his saule had no regard. For, lying in periculo mortis, Tua of the kirk to him resortis; Balcanquhall, as ane Christiane brother, And Maister Andro Melwill was the other: Both being fay?full, fearing God, Went to persuade this subtile tod Lascivous maneris to amend, Sen na m? knawis the ho? nor end. This, at the lenth, he lent them eiris And brusted out in a blus of tearis. âBrether,â he sayis, âI schame to tell Sa oft as I misvsit my sell, In guyding of the giftis of grace: Gif God wald lend me tyme and space, Twa ho??? in pulpit to deploir it, My synfull lyfe sall no? be smorit:â With this agane begane to greit. The brethrene, seing him c?treit, Gave thankis to God for his repentance; But now, for all his auld acqu?tance, He playis the turnecot to deceave them, Denyand plane that ever he spak them. To George Durrie he played a juike, That will not be foryet this oulke: Foure hundreth merkis he gart him get him, For tackis of kirkis he hecht to set him, And syne set vther men the teindis. The vther, having force of freindis, Concludit schortlie for to slea him, For vyling of his syluer fra him: As they had done, no doubt, in deid, Were not he sped him there with speid, And fand sic moyen for to meis them, Promissand proffeit for to pleis them. Whairto it turnes I can no? tell: But sua the sophist savit him sell. To him I can find na c?pair, Save anes in France when I was there, Gud Clemet Marit had a lowneâ A knaif that c?bart all the towne, With spreitis employed to everie vice, As whoredome, drincking, cartis, and dyce; To sweir, to ban, to steill and tak: Ane never my? trow a word he spak; In everie ludgene whair he wald licht, Taking his leive without gud nych[t,] Garring the wyffis sing wallaway, Lyk to the Bischop of Galloway: But he was sum thing pure and needie; And this is feinyet, fals, and griedie. Galloway with no mater meld him, Except necessitie c?peld him, Taking the warld as God wald send it, Having ane noble hart to spend it. Bot ay the mair this smatcher gettis, The closser garris he keip the yettis; Feiding his bellie and his bryde, Begging and borrowing ay besyde. Galloway was a man of gude, Discendit of a noble blude, Franck with his freind, fordward and stout, Having gude maneris to set them out: And this is but ane carle, ye sie, Ane baxteris sone of bas degrie, Feable and fleid and nothing worth, Wanting a face to set him furth. What suld I lyble of this lowne? Not all the paper of this towne, And blek it baith vnder and abone, May had the half that he hes done. Wha could cleirlie descryve his cases In Parise, and in vther places, Gif men my? tyme and laser get? Some thingis, indeid, I have forget. Perceaving that he was scant of clathis, To Londone Bischop sone he geathis, Desyring the borrowing of a gowne, He said, to preich in through the towne. The Bischop, obeying the first c?mand, Send for his wardrop man fre hand. Tuiching that part I m? c?mend him; Ane deligat gowne, indeid, he send him: Bot when that gowne comes hame agane, Winter salbe butt wind and raine. Albeit I was not there to see, He weiris it yit, to verefie; Growgraine of silk, bot it is gray; When ever ye see it, siris, ye may say He gat that gowne, with this ingyne, Weill lyned with costlie furringis fyne. How he beguylit Jhone Harper of York, Ane Scottis tailyeo? lives on his work, Aff fra a merchant he gart him tak New breikis and dowblat, for to mak, Of Turkie taffatieâna war geir: Bot as he payeth him, ye sall heir. This turne cott with his trickis begane, Growand familiar with the man, Sayand, âforsuith my siluer is done; But Londone will me releive sone. For in this toun I tak na cair: The Scottis merchantis will meit me thair With monie als mekle as I will tak. Whairfore, to my return?g back, Ye wald doe weill gif ye wald thrist me, And at this present not molest me. Ye salbe payit: tak ye no thought: Your tristene sall not be for nought At our nixt meiting.â What suld mair? The vther saw him speik so fair, To crave him forder he thoght schame. But turne cott, now return?g hame, Fand out some vther gait to gea: Sewin pund he payit this pure m? sea. Some sayes he played ane fouller thing, Bespewed the pulpett befoir the King; Or ever the preiching was midpart done He neather held vnder nor abone. Na ferlie; his c?tagious stomack Was sa owersett with Burdeous dr?make; And George Gipsones Iskie bae Had all the wyte he womit sae. Sone efter that, for sowmes of debt, A meas? vpon the gait him mett, Gewing him charges to obey, To enter in warde, or els to pay. This lowrie little ans? mackis, Bot on a gray bonnet he tackis; A scheip hewit clock to cover his cleathis; But lad or boy to Ley? he geathis; Lapp in a bott, and maid him boun; Sen syne he come not in the toun. Ane vther trick, as I remember; The threttene day of this November, Vnto his bed he bownit so fow, Sleipping and snoring lyk a sow; Dreamand some devill he had sene, Out of the bed he wald have bene; But on the flure he gat a fall, While doun come Cannabie and all Vpon his bellie with sic a brattle, The houshold, hearing sic a rattle, Mervelit mekle what it suld be; Lychtit candles, and came to sie, And fand him lyand lyk a swyne, Bayth bak and syde bespewit with wyne. Seing it rid, they waxt so red, Beleiving it had bene blood he bled, Cryand out, harmesay, he was stickit, While ane pat doun his hand and lickit: âThis is not blude, tho? it be hewit, But Burdeous wyne that he hes spewit.â With schame and lack, I will not lane, They laid him in his bed agane. Therfore I wald ye vnderstude We have na tyme for to c?clude: Far ay the longare Lowrie leivis, As fassione is of feinyit theives, They wilbe daylie for doing ill. Ewin sa I will augment my bill, As I gett witt in mair and mair Of his proceidingis heir and thair. I sall leave blankis for to imbrew thame, That he a nosebitt may beleive thame Whometo my buik salbe directit. Being in Paris lait suspectit For art and part of m?bling messis, Thought he hypocrysie professis: Albeit this be not weill set furth, Becaus the mater was no? worth, Desyre the Bischope to be c?tent, Becaus I am no? eloquent. I have tane trawell for his saik, And ryme may for a raipfull staik. Mend ye thir heidis that I rehers, I sall not faill to mend my vers. Finis. QUOD R. S. XXXIX. The Sege of the Castel of Edinburgh.The attribution of this poem is questionable.

To call to mynd hir mony fauld gude dedis: First, scho reformit the fals Idolatrie. I am in dout, in ony realme quha redis Of sa lang tyme with sic tranquillitie, Sic faithful iustice with ciuillitie, Sic frendschip keipit to hir fais sa lang: Scotland may say, for oure vtilitie, That neuer ane bettir prince in Ingl?d rang. That beand done, scho did conferme a pace, And maid th? freindis y? l?g tyme had bene fois, With stanche?g bludesched wes not eith to ceice, That men may pas, not sperand quhair he gois. Syne at the sege of Leith scho sparit ane pois, And dang the frenchm?, quhilk we docht not do; Quhill hame thay past in spyt of all thair nois, With lose of men, and left munitioun to. Quhat toung hes langage to declair at lenth Thair greit artal?erie, nor thair men of weir? France wes not able to withstand thair strenth, For powder and bullet, bowis, and vther geir. Quhat chargis wes hir schipis at, may I speir? Surmonting fiftie hunder thowsand frankis; And ?it, for all the graith hir grace send heir, Ingraitfull people gaue hir lytill thankis.

That panefull progres I think ill to tell, Sen thay ar bowit and bruderit in our band; Bot at this present tyme, exem ?our sell, Quhat confort hes thair Quene send to this land. Is not the cannones cum at ?our c?mand, Strecht to distroy the tratoures wald ouir gang vs? Commonis may crye, âlang mot that frendschip stand,â And blis hir banis sic blythnes broucht amang vs. At Leith thay landit harmeles in the Heuin, With powder and bullet, gunnis, and vther geir; Drest all thair platfurmes in to dayis seuin, Not laiking na thing that belangit to weir. Sum workmen had we or the camp cum heir; Jacques Gelliam, gangand lyke ane besy be, The gabiounes makand, kaist the trinschis neir: Quha micht do mair but ordinance nor we? The walis wes heich, we culd not weil persew thame, Bot quhen we gat thame doun, full deir thay bocht it: Be syde the woll at syndrie tymes we slew thame; That euer thay saw vs, sum of thame forthocht it. Ane poysonit woll to drink quhat docht it? Infekit watter sowllit thame, cheik and chin: Persauing that, sorrow mair thay socht it, Bot keppit standfulis at the sklatis thair in. The castell segit, and all beset about With fowseyis wyde, inueronit be slycht; Montanis and myndis leit neuer man luik out, For ordinance thay dung at day and nycht By weirlyk volyis: thocht the wallis wes wycht, ?it dowbell battrie brak thame al in inschis: Of Daueis toure, in all the toune menis sycht, Thay riggein stanes cum tumland ouir the trinschis. The vehement schot ?eid in at ather syde, By threttie Cannonis plasit at partis seuin, Quhill thay thair in mycht not thair heidis hyde For Pot Gun pellettis falland from the heuin. The Bumbard stanis derectlie fell sa euin, That in to dykis by dint it deidly dang thame, Quhill all the houssis in the place wes reuin: The bullatis brak sa in to bladis amang thame. Continewand this ane dosand of dayis or mair, Quhill tyme apointit, neuer man durst steir; The larum rang, the Regent self wes thair, My Lord Ambassat, to, stuid uerry neir; The manlie Generall, lyke the god of weir, Not vsit to sleip quhen sic thingis ar a do; Our Cronall als, quha is ane freik bot feir, With all his Capitanes reddie to ga to. Schir Harie Leis wes present at that charge; My Lord Burlayis sone, to, stuid besyde; Cottoun and Dyar saw the sowt at large; And Schir George Carie, âon the knauis!â he cryde: ?it Hume and Crafurde to the laue wes gyde, With certane Soiouris of the garysoun; Four Capitanis followit at thair bak to byde, Sempill and Hectour, Ramsay and Robesoun. Bot Hume wes first that ouir the walis wan, As I heir sayâI wes not thair my sell: The Generall sayis he playit the vail?eant man, With prayssis mo nor I intend to tell. Thocht Crafurdis ledder wes to schort ane ell, ?it ouir the walis he wan, I wat not how; Dunbartan, to, quhen sic lyke fortoun fell, Thir wes the men that wan it, I tell ?ow. The Generallis band come bauldlie at thair bak: Schir Frances Russall, with ane gudlie grace; ?axlie and Erintoun, nather of thame wes slak; Twa vther Careis, Knowis, and Capitane Kace. Than wes persewand at ane uther place Breikwell and Lammy, Mechell &amp; Capitan Game; Bauld Capitane Reid, that euir held to his face, Pickman and Wood did vail?eantly the same. Spreill, Spadyn, Traill, Hutsoun, and all the laue, Bartoun and Stirlie, Capitan Duberie slane; Thoise at the bak wall wes the brasche thay gaue; For lake of lederis thair thay wrocht in uane, The men within maid sic defence agane, Thay schot gude Manfrild in athort the throit, Quhill force did faill, and than I saw thame fane To cry âPeccauiâ with the waithman noit. Halyburtoun, Strauchan, with thair standarts stuid; Seirburne &amp; Schaftoun hes followit on thame fast; Aueris and Barrat baith wer men of gude; Gresseone and Hanis wes laith for to be last; Crippis and Cantrell to the parrell past; Auld Capit? Leirmount with ane luik to bang thame; Gude M. Setoun maid thair grumis agast: He gart the Cannones ga sa thik amang thame. Out gais the Hergbut, in the Cannon glydis, Brak al in bladdis, thay docht not weil abyde thame: Trottar and fiftie fell, and loste the hydis; The laue sa fleit, thay wist not quheir to hyde thame; Dismontit cannones slew the men besyde thame; The Suddartis swarfit, and said thay wald not sar; The house wes gud, had thay had grace to gyde thame: Quhen all wes done, we had not bene the nar. Let na man lipin in to warldlie strenth; Bot Godlie ground thay may na thing induir: Tratouris and treasone salbe tryit at lenth, Quhen men wald fanest all thair vices smuir. Sa Grange beleuit the madin Castell suir, Haueand sic forssis to defend his touris; Bot mell with madenis quhen thay play the huir: Win anis the entrie, and than the house is ?ouris. The Madene Castell it wes callit lang, With honour ay that nobill style it buir; With wemenis will ?e do thame lytill wrang; To iaip thame sa, I think it na iniuir. Na mair our Madene Castell playit the huir, Bot tuik appointm?t quhen thair wes na parel. Smaikis had the wyte: I say the hous wes suir, Had thay bene gratious with ane godlie quarel. Thay micht not byde it for the greit munitioun, Bot drew in factiones quhan the larum rang: Sum thocht it gude to cum and seik remissioun, And sum said: âbest the Secreter to hang. To his ilusiones we beleuit owir lang: Ane cruikit Ethnik, and ane crewall Tod, Inuentand wichecraft, ay deuysand wrang: Lat nane geue credance to ane drytand God.â Th? Grange grew fleyit &amp; wald na mair def?d it, For want of watter, with ane poysonit well: His men wes slane, and mekle powder spendit, And wantit force to fill the wallis that fell. Thair febill smaikrie I think ill to tell, With luik lyke Lyounes, and sa lytill done. Fy, drukin dastartis! ?e haue schamit ?oursell, That said sa weill, and syne gaue our sa sone. Dur?g this pointm?t thair wes change of graith: S? gat ane butiene for thair being thair. Greit wes the credence geuin to suddartis faith, Baith gold and siluer and of Marchand wair. Be thair expenssis for thair cuming hidder; Than on the morne thay maid the pluk vp fair; Baith Scottis &amp; Inglis syne all ?eid togidder. Vpone that spuil?e I will spend na tyme, Thay socht na taile?ours for to busc thair breikis. The suddartis luiffis wes sa ouirlaid w? lyme, Sum gripit gold and gat the thing he seikis; S? stuid beside and gat not worth twa leikis, As I heir sayâI wes not thair to se; S? gat thair handfull of thir half mark steikis Will haue na mair within ane ?eir nor we. Thay schot na keyis to brek the coffiris than, Ane day of blythnes for the men of weir: Sum stuid besyde ane wondderous sorie man, Ane duilfull day for thame that loist thair geir, First saw it tane, and syne thay durst not steir. Thair wes compleit the prophecie of Knox: âDoun fra that Crage Kirkcaldy sall reteir, With schame and scl?der lyke ane hundit fox.â With gild of pepile sa thay brocht thame doun, As birdis but plumis, spuli?eit of the nest: Part cryde: âquhair is he? lat vs se the loun; Go to and staen him; lat him tak na rest.â Quh? thay y? buir him saw thame selfis opprest, Thay cryit for succour for to saue thair lyuis: The Generallis lugeing, thair thay thocht it best, Thay led him in, thay war sa red for wyuis. The Regent then gart mak ane inhibitioun To leue the spuil?e, under pane of deid: He carit for [na] thing bot the Kingis munitioun; As for the leue, thair wes bot lytill leid. To tak the hous, thair wes na mair remeid, With all the faultis mycht follow he wes fane; Aganis ane Haiknay I sall wed my heid, Grange beis not Capitan of that Craig agane. With this the Generall wes reterit a bak; Went doun to Leith quhair he had bene befoir: Speik as ?e pleis, it wes ane vail?eant ak, And Drurie deulie did his ful deuoir. God gatand th?kis, the Quene suld haue y? gloir: We thank hir Maieste, as the mater standis: God saue hir grace! hes scho not gart restoir ?one captiue rebellis in the Regentis handis? By expectatioun of the commoun speiking, Wes it not thocht that Ingland suld begyle vs? And sum allegit it wes the Regents seiking, To sell the King, and sa thay wald ouirsyle vs, Creip in our strenthis, and suddanelie exyle vs. O Rurall pepill, rusticall, and rude! We ar the men that all the warld dois style vs, Remembring ill, and geue na thankis for gude. Ingratious pepill! ignorant and vane! Quhy do ?e noit ?our nychtboris ay with ill? Wer thay not blyith for to get hame agane, Thocht sum beleuit thay wald haue tareit still? To do ?ow plesour, thay haue schauin gude will, Baith spent thair lyues, &amp; largelie of thair geir. Alace, my Joyis! ?e had bot lytill skill, That trowit that Ingl?d wald haue tareit heir. Quhat danger wes to bring sa greit munitioun In forane landis with sic ane force indeid! The only caus wes to auoyid suspitioun, That men suld say thay come not heir for greid. Thocht sum thair be of cankreit Cain seid, Sawaris of discorde dois na vther thing: Speik as thay pleis, schame fal thair lippis y? leid! Thay mene na thing bot to mantene the King. Haif thay not thre tymes in this threttene ?eir, Ay quhen we socht th?e, send thair forces hedder, Baitht Schippis &amp; G?nis &amp; martial m? of weir, To win our kyndnes, geue we culd considdir? And now the last tyme quhen we send to bid hir, Hes scho not helpit to holk out ?one Tod? Long moit thir countreis leue in pace togidder, And grow in freinschip to the feir of God! The Lenuoy to the Regent. O richteous Regent of ane Royall race! Tratours may trimbill to behald thy face, Fering thy furie for thair foull offencis. Geue gloir to God that hes the geuin sic grace, Riches with reasoun for to reuill that place. Thow beand plantit in the sait of Prencis, Geue thow wald prosper in thy iust pretencis, Beir equall ballanis baith to riche and puir: That beand done, lang mot thy dayis induir. Sen God hes wrocht it, I am weill content To mak of the that onlie instrument To caus this countrie for to knaw the king. It wes the leuing Lord Omnipotent That maid the Barrones sa obedient, And not the force that thow to send may bring; Did neuir Regent in this Realme sic thing, Considdering alwayis as the mater stude, And maid sic greance with sa lytill blude. To speik of Regentes, we haue had sic thre, Sen God wes borne, thair micht na bettir be For wisdome, manheid, and for Godlynes: Quhairfor hes God now laid this charge on the. Bot lat vs ken that it is onlie He That rewlis the Realme, &amp; not thy richteousnes. Remember Ahab, for his febilnes, Quha gart King Benhadab in his scherat go, Quhilk wes his wrak: be war ?e do not so. Quhairfor put God the powar in ?our hand? To puneis lounes that hes ourlaid this land By murthour, treasoun, done fra ?eir to ?eir. Geue ?e obey not, brekand that Command, I am in dout geue ?our estait sall stand, Bot sone be rutit fra this Realme, I feir. Spair neuer Agag for na brybe of geir. Quhat come of Saull with his fatt Oxin thair? Ga, reid the Bybill: it will sone declair. To seik exampillis of that samin tone, My Lord of Murray wes degradit sone For not fulfiling of the Lordis desyre. First, God promouit him in the place abone; Bot fra he saw that Justice wes not done, He leit the wickit cast the wand in fyre. Be war sic materis moue not God to yre; Geue ?e be myndit on this mold remaine, And plesit God, I wald not change agane. Lanuoy to the Ambassade. My Lord Ambassade I haue lang for?et, Quhairfor indeid I haue not done my det; And he, sa cairfull for oure countrie men, For wit and wisdome worthie to be tret: In baith the landis thair is bot few to get, That wrocht sa Godlie in this cause, ?e ken. My dull indyte can not direct my pen, And thocht I culd, it wald contene ane buik To put in paper all the panis he tuk. He is not borne of better qualytie, Of quiet speiche, with greit moralytie: Swering nor bairdrie may he nan abyde, Detestand pryde and prodigalitie: As equall Juge, but persealytie, For feid or fauour, vnto ather syde; Abone all vices subiect leist to pryde; Ferme in his faith, and full of Godlynes; With marciall hart inclynit to mykenes. Weill micht the Counsels beir the gude c?mend, That sic Ambassade in to Scotland send, To speik vprichtlie and the treuth declair; For na expensis did he spair to spend, Quhill pece wes brocht vnto ane finall end. Quhar as he fand vs at the plukup fair, With walkryfe labour and expensis sair, God knawis in Scotland quhat he had ado With baith the sydis, or he culd bring vs to. In winter weddiris baith in wind and rane, Sum tyme with seiknes sa ourset with pane, He raid throw montanes many, mose, and myre. In frost and snaw, quhen all the folkis ar fane With double bonattis for to hap thair brane, Then wes he worsland our ane wondie swyre, Sum tymes at nycht, syne not to se ane fyre. Ar we addettet to sa trew ane strangear, That for our proffeit put him self in danger? As Caleb send wes for to se the land, The gydis that come gart Moyses vnderstand The land wes feirfull, and the pepill strang: Because he knew it wes the Lordis c?mand He wald not stay, bot stoutlie tuik on hand Richt vnabasitlie all that gait to gang, Ourthrew thair castellis, &amp; thair gyantis dang, Brocht th?e to miserie maid ane mynt to wr?g vs: He wes y? Caleb sen he come am?g vs. I dar be bald to say, this hundreth ?eir, He wes not strangear borne mair welcum heir, Nor plesit the Preichours half sa weill as he. On pure nor riche he neuer sparit his geir; And, geue ane Suddart had bene schot in weir, He soin?eit not to ga him self and se: Quha with this countrie culd sa weill agre To play the wise m? quhen he wes with Lordis, Syne help the puiranis, as the cause recordis? Sen reason wald that ?e returne a bak, We thank ?ow hartlie of the Godlie ak ?e wrocht amang vs, for to saif our blude. I ?ow beseik thir sempill wersis tak, With als gude will as ony man can mak. Because ?e knaw my cunning is not gude, ?e man excuse my rurall rymis rude. God saif our King, and send him lytill ado, The Quene of Ingland, and hir Counsall, to! Finis. Quod Sempill.
