      <field name="fulltext">AN EQUESTRIAN EPISTLE IN VERSE, TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF JERSEY, MASTER OF THE HORSE TO THE Prince of Wales. I who erewhile in Hymeneal strain Shew'd what love taught, and prov'd that books It is by no means insinuated here, that my late hero, the Rev. Dr. Randolph, English Preceptor to H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, has applied himself to the study of books in vain; or that, when learning was first introduced into the Doctor's brain, a fermentation ensued, till the whole was exhausted, and left it in a state of nature; but the allusion is simply to the little use there is in booking a packet in a mail-coach designed for a Princess, of which much has been said and sung. See my Epistle to Dr. R. or rather the original, in the Correspondence. are vain; Mark'd how a Doctor's graver cares combine With the brisk dalliance of a fond Divine; And like the bird of night, in accent clear, Sung spousal in my Randolph's am'rous ear; Now from celestial —Put synonimously for any Doctor in Divinity's wife; but here, by way of eminence, for Mrs. Randolph. Psyche is a pleasing term of endearment, ??? ??? ????, as the Doctor (Dr. Randolph) knows. For I really think, since the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, no union, or consummation of the tenderest wedded love ever attracted the public interest and affection so much as that of the Rev. Dr. R. and his spouse.—See my Epistle again, or the Doctor's own fond thoughts and words, in his Correspondence with Lady Jersey. Psyche's charms withdrawn, I quit the prospect “a view of something distant.” —See Dr. Johnson. of the churchman's lawn. (in Dr. Johnson's words) signifies “Fine Linen, remarkable for being used in the sleeves of Bishops.”—I am not acquainted with any Bishop-milliner in London or Bath, or I would recommend her to Dr. R. on a prospect of this fine linen being put in requisition for him. Warm with the theme, and conscious of the time, Trappings of nobler prose await my rhyme; While proudly rising in my royal course, I sing the Master of the Cambrian Horse; And bid my humbler Pegasus at home O'er Jersey dash his light poetic foam. Hail envied Peer! round whose patrician bow'rs Content distils her dews in drowsy show'rs, Where no distrust, no care, no baneful strife, Perplex the husband and the faithful wife; No doubt alarms, no luscious sweetness cloys The blest endearment of your mutual joys; Where scarce a soft vicissitude is known, Save letter'd fears, and letters not your own; While on Elysium oft your fancy dreams, Of groves unfading and Lethean streams, Where, from the Prince i.e. The Prince of Troy, Æneas. Refugit In nemus umbriferum, conjux ubi pristinus illi Respondet curis, œquatque Sichæus amorem. Æn. 6. apart, the Tyrian Dame Sichæus sought, and fann'd his equal flame.

It is impossible for me to pay a higher respect to the Earl of Jersey, than by thinking of Jupiter, Callimachus, and his Lordship at the same time. the Muse shall celebrate, Your Lady's resignation, or your fate? Your prudence, or the honours of your head; Or patience, shewn alike at board and bed? Nor think, my Jersey, lost your classic taste, That unobserv'd your periods run to waste, Or that alone to Randolph may belong The gleams of wit, or music of my song. When with the Packet fir'd, and news from “A Squire he had, whose name was Ralph, i. e. Ra?lph by Syncope for Ra(ndo)lph. Who in th'adventure went his half; Tho' writers, for more stately tone, To call him Ralpho, 'tis all one.” Hudibras, P. i. C. 1. Ralph, Who in this rare adventure went his half, (But hold, not Ralph, I speak in statelier tone, Yet should I call him Randolph, 'tis all one) Convinc'd I read your clear mellifluous lay, Where prose to metre wins its easy way, “Hear me, ye Pow'rs, who smile on Hymen's bands, “It never was in Lady Jersey's hands!” Hear my Lord's own words. “The paragraphs alluded to refer to a Packet, consigned to the care of a gentleman, the Rev. Dr. Randolph, to be conveyed to Brunswick: It never was in Lady Jersey's hands! but given to him by Her Royal Highness herself!”—Lord Jersey's Introduction to the Correspondence, p. 3.—The reader sees the necessity of a declaration from a modern writer, whether he actually writes in verse or prose, as his Lordship has supplied me with the most emphatical verse in either of my epistles, when a superficial observer would have thought Lord Jersey was only writing prose. And when detraction opes her brazen throat, You hurl defiance See the opening of Lord Jersey's Introduction. “Great pains having been taken, &amp;c. &amp;c. accusing the Countess of Jersey of having opened a letter, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do now take upon me to assert unequivocally, and without the possibility of a contradiction, that such insinuations are founded solely in malice, and not in truth, and fabricated for the most wicked purposes.” p. 1 and 2. See also the letter, or rather the Cartel de defiance from Lord Jersey to Dr. Randolph, p. 24. “It now becomes my duty to call upon you, and I do require it of you, that an explicit narrative be laid before the public; it is a justice She is entitled to; a justice Lady Jersey's Character claims, and which she has, and you have acknowledged she has, a right to demand at your hands. Your silence on this occasion I shall consider as countenancing that calumny, which the false representations of business have so shamefully and unjustly drawn upon Lady Jersey.” p. 24.—See also the end of the Introduction by Lord. J. “However indignant Lady Jersey may feel at the atrocity and fasehood of such a charge, and to be called upon to make any answer to it, it is my duty to see her character justified; and for that purpose I do lay before the public all the particulars of the transaction, as they could be collected.” Introd. p. 3. in its boldest note; A lady's right, and husband's duty join, Justice and Jersey rumble thro' the line; You throw the glove with such impassion'd art, That Dymock's Mr. Dymock is the Champion of England.—But I trust England has a champion in every hand and heart to defend her in this awful hour, whatever may be the shades of political opinions. Indeed our country has never appeared so dignified and so powerful as in the moments of the greatest danger: in the American contest and the present war with the Republic of France. “Utrumne Secundis, An magis adversis staret Romana propago? Scilicet adversis: nam quam defendier armis Suadet amor patriæ, et captiva penatibus uxor, Convenit ut—” But I should be ashamed to say what is proper to be done: my country has decided, and she will maintain it. Edmund Burke will read these noble lines of a Roman Poetess, this mascula Sappho, with that rapture which threescore winters have not subdued or diminished. Surely I may be excused if on such an occasion I add some lines, from the same poem, perhaps not generally known: “Quidnam pater Ille Deorum Cogitat? an terras et patria sæcula mutat, Quasque dedit quondam morientibus eripit artes, Invidus? an frustra, mendaxne Diespiter olim “Imperium sine fine dedi,” dixisse probatur?” Such again are the words, and such the tone of this gallant Female, who could at once deplore the extinction of learning and philosophy in the Empire, and recall the memory of ancient valour in the day of depression. If there ever was a time in these our kingdoms, of awe, of terror, of recollection, of diligence, and of seriousness, but not of despondency, it is the present hour. May it pass from us! We have to contend with a foe, cruel, powerful, inhuman, and implacable; terrible alike to every neutral state, and every pretended ally. Policy and safety are now one and the same word, and I trust every overture consistent with them will be made for peace, and no more. Experience was designed for the guide of all who are placed in similar circumstances. Had the states of the German empire offered voluntarily to their common defender, their gallant and honest Emperor, when he requested them, but half the treasures which have been extorted from them by the common plunderers and banditti of Europe, their constitution, their safety, and their happiness might have been preserved! self from you might learn his part. Nor circumscrib'd your zeal; your ardent care Rides on the whirlwind of infected air, Till all things shall cohere with time and place, Vestige on vestige tread, “An object I shall never leave uninvestigated.” Lord Jersey. —Correspondence p. 37. in Lord Jersey's Epilogue on Peroration. and trace on trace: Yet still forgive your pensive Poet's fear, What's past is past, and nothing will appear.

So far Horace: now hear Lady Jersey: “I think you will agree with me, that defending myself from the charge of opening a letter, is pretty much the same as if I was to prove that I had not picked a pocket.” Lady Jersey's Letter to Dr. R. Correspondence, p. 18. “For who unblushing could a letter ope, “Pockets might pick, and soon deserve a rope;” And sure, if truth and sense to verse belong, Horace and she go hand in hand in song.

What cannot paragraphs?—there all appear, Large is their bounty, and their zeal sincere; They give, they take, they lend, they beg, they steal, Their force, at Dunkirk, Chancellors can feel; Arm'd in his sagum Loughb'rough's form they draw, The blunderbuss at once of war and law, And on his woolsack paint the hated wall, And York's retreat, and gallant Moncrief's fall.

Sometimes they paint, how Chom'ley dreams intent On quarter'd bills, first tax'd by Timmy Brent; While, at your call when grooms the steeds adorn, The Prince comes forth, and blushes like the morn, What time she first unbars the purple doors Rich from the East, and o'er the regal floors With lavish hand the gifts of nature throws, Flow'rs of all hues, and, with some thorns, the rose.

For me—no breezy shore, no cooling bow'r, No Vallombrosa sooths my lonely hour, Written in the middle of August in the heats of London. While brooding o'er my bleeding country's cries, Damps of domestic melancholy rise, And all my balm of life would fain consume; Still my firm soul, superior o'er the gloom, Fortune to others leaves, still proud to own The muse, her hope, and studious cares alone. Hence in my chosen themes, if chance I write, No words are dark from your excess of light, Nor reason's rules, once taught in Plato's grove, Bend, like fond Randolph's, in the cause of love. Simplicity's my aim; whate'er I tell, I call no rhymes from the profound of See “A Poem written towards the close of the year 1794, upon a Prospect of the Marriage of the Prince of Wales,” by The Rev. J. Hurdis, B. D. Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford.”—The Professor may appropriate to himself the “De Profundis Clamavi,” as appears by almost all his verses, but most in the following: “Though Hell “Her murky legions round about him pour, “Hell fire his ramparts, Hell in her own smoke “Cloud his recoiling bastions, Hell direct “His molten sleet, Hell show'r upon his foe “His pond'rous hail intense, yet, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Hola! Indeed before I perceived that the Oxford Poetry-Professor was speaking of the French, as I now imagine he is, (for one may be well lost in the bathos of the subject, and the ???????????? of the Tartarian images) I was fearful he was about to say to some illustrious personage or other, “Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee there;” whereas it should be the peculiar office of all Professors of Poetry and and Divinity to keep him from it, if possible. Mr. Hurdis is certainly no rival to the Dean, so celebrated for “never naming hell to ears polite;” for he out-Satans Satan. The boldness of Oxford exceeds that of Florence; and the infernal poetry of Mr. Professor Hurdis will soon supersede Dante. Yet I own I was surprised, when Mr. Professor was about to sing of royal nuptials, that the idea of Paradise should not rather have opened to his view. But alas, “Fate had fast bound him with Styx nine times round him;” and so I leave Mr. Professor Hurdis to be exorcised by all his Brother Conjurors in the University in a solemn incantation at the opening of the term, in the Sheldonian theatre, or under the dome of Radcliffe, with the high mass of “Serus in cœlum redeat!” —N.B. The University of Oxford trusts many faculties and sciences to their various Professors for life, but with the greatest propriety (hoc populus sapiens et justus in uno) will never trust her Poetry for a longer term than seven years to any of her chosen Laureats.—From what I have seen of poetical animals, and from conversation with Sir John Sinclair and the Board of Agriculture, I think it is sometimes proper to change the pasture of a poet, in order to produce different kinds of verses, and sometimes even to cross the breed in the Universities. For when a Professor has been shut up and fed on hard dry meat in a college for a long time, he naturally acquires a viscidity in his juices, and moves stiff, which can only be removed by turning him out to grass.—I do not mean to recommend this to Poets near London, as we want all the grass for the cows; but perhaps the Ranger, Lord Euston (one of the best-natured and very best tempered men in the kingdom I ever knew) might be prevailed upon to allow a poet to frisk a little in the Green Park before Lord Grenville, to try what he could get. hell, Nor will with Oxford's deep-ton'd Laureat think; I sail before the breeze, but never sink. Nor on th'embattled storm ascending, bring Stones from high heav'n, with cloud-compelling ???????????? ????.—See a very ingenious treatise just published in 4to entitled, “Remarks concerning Stones, said to have fallen from the Clouds, both in these days and in ancient times, By Edward King, Esq. F.R.S. and F.A.S.”—Much curious information is collected and brought into one point of view on a singular subject.—But all I mean to say is this; I neither go down to Hell, nor up to the clouds, for my subjects, as I wish to be intelligible upon earth; and wish all authors would have no higher ambition. “Indocilis privata loqui,” is the great bane and pest of modern language, in speaking and in writing. King, Nor yet with Stutz, or Blagden, move awhile Distorted mouths with many a scoffing smile. Abbè Stutz, Assistant in the Imperial cabinet of curiosities at Vienna, has described some of the stones, &amp;c. &amp;c. and Sir Charles Blagden has fairly translated part of his account, “About the origin “of which many mouths have been distorted with scoffing laughter.” Mr. King's R. p. 23. Yet I am sure I have no objection to any account of these stones “verified by Wolfgang Kukulyewich, Spiritual Vicar of Francis Baron Clobuschiczky Bishop of Agram.” p. 24. for whom I have a great respect; but I must own I have some distrust of the propriety of the German-Anglo phrases introduced by Sir Charles in his translation. I am also rather uneasy, as I have a suspicion that the King of Prussia may have been tampering with Sir Charles Blagden (when he was on his tour) and persuading him to introduce this sartago of speech into England, first among the Royal Society Philosophers, thence to the Linnæans, thence to the Board of Agriculture, thence to, &amp;c. &amp;c. Indeed there is no trusting his Majesty of Prussia in any thing, from a treaty to a grammar: he dupes the Minister, and confounds the philologist. Nor is my mansion by th'oblivious streams; I mark where fortune's sons, in golden dreams, Bask in the fields of ministerial day, Know their own Largior hic campos æther, et lumine vestit Purpureo, solemque suum, sua sidera norunt.

Or chance to Weymouth's favour'd bay resort, Round Ocean's King where guardian Nereids sport: Oh, may no felon blast assault the sail, When proud Fiorenzo St. Fiorenzo is the name of the ship in which the King takes the diversion of sailing at Weymouth. (in 1796) “Sic te Diva potens Cypri, Ventorumque regat Pater, Navis, quæ tibi creditum Debes Brunsvicium! finibus, ah, suis Reddas incolumem, precor, Et serves patriæ dimidium meæ!” rides before the gale; Yet think how faithless is the billowy realm, Death's on the prow, though pleasure's at the helm: Pause on that shore, great Brunswick! trust the muse; Nor give your kingdom for a morning's cruize!— It is to be hoped H.M. will deeply consider the consequences of “A royal captivity among inhuman foes!” and the nature, or perhaps the impossibility, of a ransom or a Redemption, amidst the agony and affection of his brave and loyal people. I sometimes strive to paint, with Cowper's skill, Where The Young Wantons sport on Anna's Hill; Where with wild nature Fox Mr. Fox's summer amusements this year (1796) at St. Anne's Hill, Surry, have been most judiciously and happily divided between the study of botany, the harp of young Meyer, the wit of Aspasia, and the pleasantest of all romances, the Odyssy of Homer in the original Greek.

I believe no man enters into the spirit of Homer more deeply or more accurately than Mr. Fox. I shall never, to the latest hour of my life, forget the impression which his commentary on some lines of Homer, at the summing up of one of the charges against Mr. Hastings in Westminster Hall, made upon me. It was the rapture of Longinus tempered by the reasoning of the Stagyrite. in angel notes recall His own sad Indian bill, and hapless fall; While entertain'd with odorous sweets and flow'rs, Calypso's charms marine and Circe's bow'rs, Homer to Charles presents a happier plan, And sooths the lot of the much suffering man.

Sometimes I mark where Lansdown tells his tale, As once Umbritius in th'Egerian vale, “Hic tunc Umbritius; quando artibus, inquit, honestis Nullus in urbe locus, nulla emolumenta, &amp;c.” Juv.

Loud thunder shakes the Commons! Doctors Commons. The prospect of the influence which Dr. Randolph's fondness will have over the whole island of Great Britain, and that unshaken fidelity which will be the consequence of it, however pleasing to the world in general, is rather terrifying to the advocates and judges in the celebrated courts of Doctors Commons.
