      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. âIt is a weary and a bitter hour, When first the real disturbs the poet's world, And he distrusts the future. Not for that Should cold despondency weigh down the soul, It is a glorious gift, bright Poetry, And should be thankfully and nobly used. Let it look up to Heaven!â âL. E. L. HAPPY HOURS. Where are theyâthose happy hours, Link'd with everything I see, With the colour of the flowers, With the shadow of the tree! Still the golden light is falling, As when first I saw the place; I can hear the sweet birds calling To their young and callow race. Still the graceful trees are bending, Heavy with the weight of bloom, Lilae and laburnum blending With the still more golden broom; Still the rosy May hath bowers With her paler sister made; Where, where are the happy hours I have pass'd beneath their shade? Ah! those hours are turn'd to treasures Hidden deep the heart within; That heart has no deeper pleasures Than the thought of what has been. Every pleasure in remembrance, Is like coined gold, whose claim Rises from the stamp'd resemblance Which bestows a worth and name. Still doth memory inherit All that once was sweet and fair, Like a soft and viewless spirit Bearing perfume through the air; Not a green leaf, doom'd to wither, But has link'd some chain of thoughtâ Not a flower by spring brought hither, But has some emotion brought. Let the lovely ones then perish, They have left enough behind, In the feelings that we cherish, Thoughts that link'd them with the mind. Summer haunts of summer weather, Almost is it sweet to part; For ye leave the friends together, To whom first ye link'd my heart. May 31, 1836. TO MRS. ? My own kind friend, long years may pass Ere thou and I shall meet, Long years may pass ere I again Shall sit beside thy feet. My favourite place!âI could look up, And meet in weal or woe The kindest looks I ever knewâ That I shall ever know. How many hours have pass'd away In that accustom'd place, Thy answer lighting, ere it came, That kind and thoughtful face. How many sorrows, many cares, Have sought thee like a shrine! Thoughts that have shunn'd all other thoughts, Were trusted safe to thine. How patient, and how kind thou wert! How gentle in thy words! Never a harsh one came to mar The spirit's tender chords. In hours of bitter suffering, Thy low, sweet voice was near; And every day it grew more kind, And every day more dear. The bitter feelings were assuaged, The angry were subdued, Ever thy gentle influence Call'd back my better mood. Am I too happy now?âI feel Sometimes as if I were; The future that before me lies, Has many an unknown care. I cannot choose but marvel too, That this new love can be More powerful within my heart, Than what I feel for thee. Didst thou, thyself, once feel such love So strong within the mind, That for its sake thou wert content To leave all else behind? And yet I do not love thee lessâ I even love thee more; I ask thy blessing, ere I go Far from my native shore! How often shall I think of thee, In many a future scene! How can affection ever be To me, what thine has been. How many words, scarce noticed now, Will rise upon my heart, Touch'd with a deeper tenderness, When we are far apart! I do not say, forget me not, For thou wilt not forget; Nor do I say, regret me not, I know thou wilt regret. And bitterly shall I regret The friend I leave behind, I shall not find another friend So careful and so kind. I met thee when my childish thoughts Were fresh from childhood's hours, That pleasant April time of life, Half fancies and half flowers. Since then how many a change and shade, In life's web have been wrought! Change has in every feeling been, And change in every thought. But there has been no change in thee, Since to thy feet I came, In joy or sorrow's confidence, And still thou wert the same. Farewell, my own beloved friend! A few years soon pass by; And the heart makes its own sweet home Beneath a stranger sky. A home of old remembrances Where old affections dwell; While Hope, that looks to other days, Soothes even this farewell. Strong is the omen at my heart, That we again shall meet; God bless thee, till I take, once more, My own place at thy feet! Letitia Elizabeth Landon. THE POLAR STAR. This star sinks below the horizon in certain latitudes. I watched it sink lower and lower every night, till at last it disappeared. A star has left the kindling skyâ A lovely northern lightâ How many planets are on high, But that has left the night! I miss its bright familiar face; It was a friend to me, Associate with my native place And those beyond the sea. It rose upon our English sky, Shone o'er our English land, And brought back many a loving eye And many a gentle hand. It seem'd to answer to my thought, It called the past to mind, And with its welcome presence brought All I had left behind. The voyage, it lights no longer, ends Soon on a foreign shore; How can I but recall the friends Whom I may see no more? Fresh from the pain it was to partâ How could I bear the pain? Yet strong the omen in my heart That saysâWe meet again. Meet with a deeper, dearer love; For absence shows the worth Of all from which we then remove, Friends, home, and native earth. Thou lovely polar star! mine eyes Still turned the first on thee, Till I have felt a sad surprise That none look'd up with me. But thou hast sunk below the wave, Thy radiant place unknown; I seem to stand beside a grave, And stand by it alone. Farewell!âah, would to me were given A power upon thy light, What words upon our English heaven Thy loving rays should write! Kind messages of love and hope Upon thy rays should be; Thy shining orbit would have scope Scarcely enough for me. Oh, fancy, vain as it is fond, And little needed too; My friends! I need not look beyond My heart to look for you. L. E. L. NIGHT AT SEA. The lovely purple of the noon's bestowing Has vanish'd from the waters, where it flung A royal colour, such as gems are throwing Tyrian or regal garniture among. 'Tis night, and overhead the sky is gleaming, Thro' the slight vapour trembles each dim star; I turn awayâmy heart is sadly dreaming Of scenes they do not light, of scenes afar. My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me, as I think of you? By each dark wave around the vessel sweeping, Farther am I from old dear friends removed; Till the lone vigil that I now am keeping, I did not know how much you were beloved. How many acts of kindness little heeded, Kind looks, kind words, rise half reproachful now! Hurried and anxious, my vex'd life has speeded, And memory wears a soft accusing brow. My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me, as I think of you? The very stars are strangers, as I catch them Athwart the shadowy sails that swell above; I cannot hope that other eyes will watch them At the same moment with a mutual love. They shine not there, as here they now are shining; The very hours are changed.âAh, do ye sleep? O'er each home pillow midnight is decliningâ May some kind dream at least my image keep! My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me, as I think of you? Yesterday has a charm, To-day could never Fling o'er the mind, which knows not till it parts How it turns back with tenderest endeavour To fix the past within the heart of hearts. Absence is full of memory, it teaches The value of all old familiar things; The strengthener of affection, while it reaches O'er the dark parting, with an angel's wings. My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me as I think of you? The world, with one vast element omittedâ Man's own especial element, the earth; Yet, o'er the waters is his rule transmitted By that great knowledge whence has power its birth. How oft on some strange loveliness while gazing Have I wish'd for you,âbeautiful as new, The purple waves like some wild army raising Their snowy banners as the ship cuts through. My friends, my absent friends; Do you think of me, as I think of you? Bearing upon its wings the hues of morning, Up springs the flying fish like life's false joy, Which of the sunshine asks that frail adorning Whose very light is fated to destroy. Ah, so doth genius on its rainbow pinion Spring from the depths of an unkindly world; So spring sweet fancies from the heart's dominion,â Too soon in death the scorched-up wing is furl'd. My friends, my absent friends! Whate'er I see is linked with thoughts of you. No life is in the air, but in the waters Are creatures, huge and terrible and strong; The sword-fish and the shark pursue their slaughters, War universal reigns these depths along. Like some new island on the ocean springing, Floats on the surface some gigantic whale, From its vast head a silver fountain flinging, Bright as the fountain in a fairy tale. My friends, my absent friends! I read such fairy legends while with you. Light is amid the gloomy canvas spreading, The moon is whitening the dusky sails, From the thick bank of clouds she masters, shedding The softest influence that o'er night prevails. Pale is she like a young queen pale with splendour, Haunted with passionate thoughts too fond, too deep; The very glory that she wears is tender, The eyes that watch her beauty fain would weep. My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me, as I think of you? Sunshine is ever cheerful, when the morning Wakens the world with cloud-dispelling eyes; The spirits mount to glad endeavour, scorning What toil upon a path so sunny lies. Sunshine and hope are comrades, and their weather Calls into life an energy, like spring's; But memory and moonlight go together, Reflected in the light that either brings. My friends, my absent friends! Do you think of me, then? I think of you. The busy deck is hush'd, no sounds are waking But the watch pacing silently and slow; The waves against the sides incessant breaking, And rope and canvas swaying to and fro. The topmast sail, it seems like some dim pinnacle Cresting a shadowy tower amid the air; While red and fitful gleams come from the binnacle, The only light on board to guide usâwhere? My friends, my absent friends, Far from my native land, and far from you. On one side of the ship, the moonbeam's shimmer In luminous vibration sweeps the sea, But where the shadow falls, a strange pale glimmer Seems, glow-worm like, amid the waves to be. All that the spirit keeps of thought and feeling, Takes visionary hues from such an hour; But while some phantasy is o'er me stealing, I startâremembrance has a keener power. My friends, my absent friends! From the fair dream I start to think of you. A dusk line in the moonlight I discover, What all day long vainly I sought to catch; Or is it but the varying clouds that hover Thick in the air, to mock the eyes that watch? No; well the sailor knows each speck, appearing, Upon the tossing waves, the far-off strand; To that dusk line our eager ship is steering. Her voyage doneâto-morrow we shall land. August 15. L. E.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. CASTRUCCIO CASTRUCANI; OR, THE TRIUMPH OF LUCCA. A TRAGEDY. BY L. E. L. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. MEN. Castruccio CastrucaniâLeader of the popular party in Lucca Count GonsalviâEnvoy from Florence. Count Arreziâone of the secretly opposed Nobles. Count Leoniâhis Nephew, just relurned from travel. CesarioâSecretary to Castruccio. Nobles, Citizens, Soldiers, &amp;c.WOMEN. BiancaâDaughter of Count Arrezi, betrothed to Castruccio. Clarichaâan orphan dependant in the house of Arrezi. Ladies, Attendants, &amp;c. Scene lies in Lucca. ACT I. Scene I. âA Market-place. Citizens grouped together, talking earnestly. 1ST CITIZEN. How was he taken? for he would have fought A dozen single handed. 2ND CITIZEN. Last night, returning from the Count Arrezi, To whose fair daughter he has been betrothed, He was surrounded by those foreign bandits That wear Count Ludolph's colours. 1ST CITIZEN. Work fitting to their mercenary hands. 2ND CITIZEN. I saw the whole, for I was late at work. Castruccio pass'd me as I hurried home; Dark as it was, I knew his stately form! He cross'd the street, and out of ambush sprung The secret enemy. I saw him fling His cloak upon the groundâout flash'd his bladeâ But the dark night was lit with glittering steel, And twenty swords were drawn to meet but one. I heard the clash, then a fierce struggleâoathsâ And he was hurried past: the moon shone out, And there lay on the ground a broken sword, But red with blood. Enter Cesario. 1ST CITIZEN. Here comes his young and trusted officer, The Count Cesario; he will tell us more. 2ND CITIZEN. What of Castruccio's fateâwhat of our chief? CESARIO. The treachery of the nobles has prevail'd. Castruccio lies within the city prison, Thither convey'd by Ludolph's foreign band; A thousand dangers circle him around, The secret dagger, and the open scaffold. 2ND CITIZEN. Well, now we have no friend! CESARIO. He was your friend; the meanest citizen Found, in the shadow of Castruccio's name, His best security. 2ND CITIZEN. He never wrung from us our hard-earn'd gains. 1ST CITIZEN. Our lives were precious to him; must he die? 2ND CITIZEN. The nobles are too strong. CESARIO. 'Tis for your sake they are his enemies. He might have shared their power, and kept ye slaves. 2ND CITIZEN. We have been much oppress'd; until he came, No one could sit in quiet at his door. Money and blood were the perpetual cry Of our small tyrants. CESARIO. So will it be again, If your protector perish. ALL. He shall not die! CESARIO. The nobles will not listen to your prayers. 1ST CITIZEN. We will try threats. CESARIO. Threats are as vain as prayersâye must try deeds. 2ND CITIZEN. What can we do? We are unarm'd and weak! CESARIO. But strong in your good cause. Oh, ye are strong, If ye would know your strength! 2ND CITIZEN. When he was free, we could defy the world. CESARIO. Then give him what ye owe himâliberty. 2ND CITIZEN. All Lucca will rise up! 1ST CITIZEN. Before this, I have fought upon his side; Up! let our watch-word be Castruccio's name. CESARIO. Let the high Heaven hear it; will ye stand Meek, pitiful spectators of his death? 2ND CITIZEN. The nobles will not shed Castruccio's blood. 1ST CITIZEN. When have they been so merciful to spare? 2ND CITIZEN. They will not spare from mercy, but from fear. CESARIO. Who should they fear? 2ND CITIZEN. The oppress'd and desperate. CESARIO. Not if oppression find relief in words. 1ST CITIZEN. There's not a street in Lucca but should run Red with our blood before Castruccio die! CESARIO. 'Tis well, if ye dare act upon these words. ALL. We dare. CESARIO. Let each one to his neighbours instantly; Gather what force ye can; by two and threes Return, and then we'll try the prison's strength. 2ND CITIZEN Three of the nobles come this way. CESARIO. We must disperse until the hour arrive, What time the nobles seek the Senate-house. 2ND CITIZEN. Where they will meet to doom Castruccio's death. CESARIO. Short space is ours, be silent, and away. In one half hour seek ye the market-place; Castruccio Castrucani is the word. â[Exeunt. Enter Nobles. 1ST NOBLE (putting two of the Citizens aside). Out of the way, ye loiterers. 2ND NOBLE. What do ye here, wasting what ye call time, And then complain of want? 1ST CITIZEN (Aside). Our time will come. â[Exit. 1ST NOBLE. What said the knave? 2ND NOBLE. Good saints, I know as little as I care. I do not share Castruccio's sympathy For those who are the dust beneath my feet. 1ST NOBLE. 'Tis pity of him; for more gallant knight Ne'er led the foremost, still himself the first. I grudge the yielding to the Florentines That now must follow. 2ND NOBLE. Better submission to the distant power Than that within our gates; the citizens, Stirr'd by Castruccio, talk of their rights: Time was, a creditor, grown troublesome, Might hang, a useful warning, at our door; But Castrucani has so changed the state, That not a knave who walks the market-place But holds his life as precious as our own. Why Lucca is as quiet as a bower. 1ST NOBLE. We have had stirring times outside our walls, Victory on victory o'er the Florentines. 2ND NOBLE. And this has dazzled ye: ye have not mark'd How stronger, hour by hour, has grown his sway. Among ourselves, if it were left to him, We should not have a single privilege Beyond the meanest citizen. Enter the Count Leoni, as if from a journey, speaking to his Page as he enters. See all your charges safe: then follow me, Bringing the casket where my cousin's name Is work'd in pearls. 1ST NOBLE. Welcome again to Lucca, Count Leoni. (All gather round him.) LEONI. Kind greeting to you all: I am right glad To see my friends and native walls again. 2ND NOBLE. You're come upon us in a stirring time. 1ST NOBLE. Tell him at once Castruccio is our prisoner. 2ND NOBLE. You're over hasty; for the count may be One of Castruccio's partisans. 1ST NOBLE. Arrezi always liked the strongest side, And hence betrothed his daughter to Castruccio. LEONI. What, to my cousinâto the fair Bianca? 1ST NOBLE. You do not look as if you liked the news. 2ND NOBLE. Will you go with us to the Senate-house? Your uncle will be there. LEONI. As yet I am too new to join your councils. 2ND NOBLE. We may not loiter, even now awaits The envoy sent from Florence. LEONI. Make ye what terms ye canâsecure yourselves: The Florentines will gladly aid your cause. They hate Castruccioâhate, because they fear. 2ND NOBLE. We are too late: farewell, we meet anon. [Exeunt. LEONI (Solus). Well, fortune, thou hast stood my friend at last! I came to struggle with mine enemy, And, lo! he is subdued. Castruccio lies A prisoner at the mercy of his foes. For him there is one only ransomâdeath! Soon will these hasty nobles want a head: The power and wealth of our most ancient house Point to Arrezi as the nobles' chief, And he will be a cypher in my hands. Now will my secret trafficking with Florence Stand in good stead: my path is clear before me. The odium of the Castrucani's death, And the inglorious peace they now must make, Rests with the nobles. Fortune, now thy tide Is on the turnâI dare to ride thy waves. Strange that Castruccio, who through life has been My too successful rival, now should make My first step in the ladder of ambition. Now must I seek my cousin, fair Bianca, So nearly lost; how will she greet me now? Castruccio's sway has been right absolute, Or never had Arrezi let his child Link with our house's ancient enemy. [Exit. Scene II. âThe Senate-house. Count Gonsalvi, Count Arrezi, Nobles, Attendants, &amp;c. GONSALVI (taking a seat). Henceforward Florence claims your fealty; She will secure you in all ancient rights, Immunity, and privilege: her sword Will stand between ye and your enemies. For this a yearly tribute must be paid Of twenty thousand florins. 2ND NOBLE. Our treasury's low, my lord. GONSALVI. And so is ours, Exhausted by the late vexatious war. 2ND NOBLE. Urged by the Count Castruccio, not ourselves. GONSALVI. It must be paid. 2ND NOBLE. Well, well, The goldsmiths round our market-place are rich. The citizens, too, better being poor, As more obedient, right that they should pay The penalty of their rebellious spirit. GONSALVI (rising). I leave you till to-morrow, when I bring The treaty ready for your signatures, And will receive your homage and your oaths. â[Exit. 1ST NOBLE. Homage and tributeâthese are bitter words! 2ND NOBLE. Less bitter than the Castrucani's sway. 1ST NOBLE. To-day must fix his fate. What is his doom? SEVERAL NOBLES. Death! ARREZI. Rather say exile. 2ND NOBLE. Yes, and one week sees him again our chief! ARREZI. He may be kept strict prisoner. 2ND NOBLE. And keep perpetual terror o'er our heads. SEVERAL NOBLES. His scaffold is our safety. ARREZI. We dare not raise that scaffold. SEVERAL NOBLES. Dare not! ARREZI. The citizens would rise in his defence. 1ST NOBLE. Not with our swords to teach them what they are. 2ND NOBLE. Why risk a tumult that we well may spare, While Lucca has a dagger? 1ST NOBLE. He shall not perish by the assassin's hand. 2ND NOBLE. So that he perish, little matters how. ARREZI. The tumult would be fearful. 1ST NOBLE. Even now The people gather fiercely in the streets. 2ND NOBLE. Let them not see him, they will soon forget. ARREZI. Hark to the shouts! 1ST NOBLE. I have a useful knave, who, give him gold, Stabs and forgets; I'll send him to the prison. 2ND NOBLE. The noise approaches, look ye to your swords. 1ST NOBLE. Delay is fatalâlet Castruccio die! (While he is speaking the doors are burst open, and Castruccio enters, armed and attended. CASTRUCCIO. Not yet, nor by your hand! Thanks, gentlemen, For an indifferent lodging. I have learnt That prisons, tenanted with thoughts of death, Is not a punishment to order lightly; Therefore, ye shall not fill my vacant place. 2ND NOBLE. The game is yoursâI, for one, ask not mercy! CASTRUCCIO. And, therefore, worthier to have unask'd. Ye do mistake me, signors: all my thoughts To ye are grateful ones. But for your rash And ill-advised attempt, I had not known How true the love on which my power is builtâ How strong the cause the people trust with me! Re-enter Count Gonsalvi. GONSALVI. I must demand some escort: for the streets Are fill'd with people, and unwillingly Would I shed blood. What! Castrucani here? CASTRUCCIO. Ready to give the Count Gonsalvi audience, And ask, what are the terms he brings from Florence? GONSALVI. With these, the representatives of Lucca, I have arranged our treaty. CASTRUCCIO. On what terms? GONSALVI. That ye submit yourselves, and pledge your faith True vassals unto Florence: and each year Remit your tributeâtwenty thousand florins! CASTRUCCIO. Tribute and homage! can they sink so low, Men who have met ye bravely in the field? Now hear me, Count Gonsalvi: Lucca rather Would see her walls dismantled, than consent To yield such base submission! GONSALVI. These are her chiefsâin their consent she yields. CASTRUCCIO You see that they are silent. By my voice Does Lucca speak: she would be glad of peace, An equal, sure, and honourable peaceâ To terms like these she has but one replyâdefiance. GONSALVI. Florence will teach you better in the field! CASTRUCCIO. This to your conqueror: not three weeks have pass'd Since, in the field, we met. I think you found More service from your spurs than from your swords. GONSALVI. 'Twas an unlucky chance of war. CASTRUCCIO. Not so, my lord; there was a higher causeâ The right against the wrong. Your army came, A mercenary and a selfish band, Some urged by false ambition, some for spoil. No noble motive noble impulse gave: Ye were aggressors, and ye fought like such. I tell you, count, with not a third your numbers I chased your flying hosts within your gates. GONSALVI. I came not for a boast but for an answerâ War or submission. CASTRUCCIO. War or submission! sad such choice and stern: Vast is the sufferingâgreat the wrong of war! Butâand all Lucca speaketh in these wordsâ Rather we take the suffering; and the wrong Rests on the oppressor's head, than we submit. Not while one hand can strike on Lucca's side, Not while one stone is left of Lucca's walls, Not while one heart beats in our country's cause, Will Lucca stoop beneath a foreign yoke. Ye only fight for conquest or for spoil: We for our homes, our rights, our ancient walls! The sword is drawnâGod be the judge between us! GONSALVI. Have ye no other answer? CASTRUCCIO. None! Cesario is your escort to the gates. GONSALVI. I take your answerâwar, then, to the death. â[Exit. 2ND NOBLE. Are ye not rash in this? how weak our state, Compared with Florence. CASTRUCCIO. Twice have we met them in the open field, Each time they fled before us. Oh! my friends, If I may call ye such, we are not weak Who have our own good swords, and urge a war Just in the sight of heaven. Our weakness lies In our dissension, in the small base aims That disunite us from the common cause. Lucca were strong, had Lucca but one heart! Why should ye be mine enemies? I seek Yours in the general good. I stand between Ye and a people whom ye would oppress. Know ye not, love has stronger rule than fear? A country, fill'd with tyrants and with slaves, What waits upon her history?âcrime and shame! But the free state, where every rank is knit By general blessings, freedom shared by all, There is prosperityâthere those great names Whose glory lingers though themselves be gone. It is not I ye serve, it is your country! â(Applause.) 2ND NOBLE. (Aside). I see that we must yield, or seem to yield; He's master now. CASTRUCCIO. And for this base submission To your hereditary enemies, There is no yoke so galling as the yoke Foreign invaders place upon your neck! The heavy and the arbitrary sway That ye would fix upon your countrymen, Would soon be on yourselves. Lucca is free; To keep her so is trusted to your swords! I march to meet the Florentines to-morrow; Will ye not follow me for Lucca's sake? NOBLES. We will. CASTRUCCIO. Now must I forth to thank the citizens. (Sees Arrezi.) The Count Arrezi here! ARREZI. I came here as your friend. CASTRUCCIO. Then bear but hence my greetings to your daughter. ARREZI. My lord, she is much honour'd! (Shouts without.) CASTRUCCIO. The people are impatient, let us forth: I am impatient, too, to thank their love. We will go forth together, and with them Make common cause. [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. Scene I. âApartment in the Arrezi Palace. CLARICHA. (Seated at an embroidering-frame.) The past it is my world: ah! but for that, How could I bear the present? In the past Is garner'd all most precious to my soul. It is not true that love decays or dies With time or absence: years have pass'd away, Yet still my dreams are faithful to one thought. One voice makes secret music in my ear, Distinct as when it breathed its earliest vow. Long since hath hope grown faint, but weary never! Fate may have said that we shall meet no more! But rather would I live upon the love Whose only food is memory, than forget, And ask oblivion for its cold content. Enter Leoni. LEONI. Nay, I must not disturb you: pray resume Your graceful task. CLARICHA. Pardon me, sir. â(Goingâhe detains her.) LEONI. 'Tis long since I have seen so fair a face, And cannot part with it so readily. CLARICHA. I will announce your coming to my lady. LEONI. She knows it, sweet, and will be here anon. The time will not seem long with those dark eyes To count the minutes by. CLARICHA. You must excuse my stay. [Snatches her hand from himâexit. Leoni (Solus). Women exaggerate all thingsâmost of all Our flatteries and their power. Foolish girl! She might have pass'd my waiting pleasantly. But soft! here comes my uncle. Enter Arrezi. ARREZI. Welcome, fair nephew, once again to Lucca. LEONI. Thanks, my kind kinsman; but, before I say A word of greeting, tell me of your news. ARREZI. This 'twixt ourselvesâI bring the very worst. Castruccio is again the lord of Lucca. LEONI. It cannot be. ARREZI. The people rose and freed him from his prison, Bore him in triumph to the senate-house, And, once among us, all gave way before him. LEONI. What! did ye yield, so many as ye were? ARREZI. What could we do? strong as the angry sea, The people gather'd fiercely at the gates, And many of the younger nobles lean'd Towards his side, chafed at the thoughts of peace Bought by submission to the Florentines. LEONI (Aside). Cowards and traitors to themselves.(Aloud.) And now What is the course ye mean to follow? ARREZI. Our power is broken, and we must submit. LEONI. Is it the head of our most noble house Who names submission to the Castrucani? ARREZI. What can we do? he's brave and eloquent. His sword subdues the Florentines, his tongue Enchants the people! LEONI. What can ye do?âresist. ARREZI. What has resulted from our late resistance But a more firm assurance to his sway? LEONI. Fools, that could let a prison stand between Their enemy and death! ARREZI. We must conciliate now. LEONI. He is to wed The fair Bianca. ARREZI. We shall share his power. LEONI. I like no sharing but the lion's share. This was not once the temper of our house: The Castrucani owed their banishment To us and ours. ARREZI. Ah! those were glorious days. None question'd, then, our rightful sovereignty. LEONI. Which half the citizens now laugh to scorn. As yet I have not been an hour in Lucca, Yet I can see all things are changed. ARREZI. Too true! LEONI. Your servants are your masters; where are gone Your old respect and high authority? ARREZI. I do not know the times in which I live, So much of change lies heavy on each hour! Castruccio comes to-nightânow greet him fair. LEONI. What! when he comes a suitor to my cousin? ARREZI. Such an alliance will secure us all. LEONI. I tell you, count, that it shall never be; Think upon what you owe your ancient line: Its feuds are bonds its honour must hold dear. We hate the Castrucani! ARREZI. I have small cause, if you knew all, to love them. LEONI. And yet you yield and tamper with Castruccio. ARREZI. And once again, I say, what can we do? LEONI (Aside). He waversâancient hatred is too strong For the new bond of interest and of fear, But yet I dare not trust him with the scheme That rises dark and vague upon my mind. I must think more. (Aloud.)âAgain, I say, resist! But wisely, calmly; never should the sword Flash till it strikes. ARREZI. I'll tell you truly, kinsman, I like not this alliance: it is forced On us by evil days and evil fortunes. Now, more than ever, do we need such aid, For I misdoubt but that Castruccio knows 'Twas not to serve him that I sought the council When he was prisoner. LEONI. Bid him, as you said, To a gay banquet here, and bid with him All his chief followers; let us seem friends: And, if we watch our hour, that hour will come. ARREZI. I'll to the Castrucani palace straight, And urge our welcome. [Exit. LEONI. (Solus). And he will come; danger escaped but makes The brave more daring; and Castruccio's brave. It is a desperate game that I must try, And yet our only chance. There's little time, But haste is the friend of enterprise: I will but snatch a moment with Bianca, Then to my task. [Exit. Scene II. âInterior of a Church. Claricha enters, and makes an Offering of Flowers at the Shrine of the Madonna. CLARICHA (Solus). Lady divine, who yet art bound to earth By the strong tie of sorrows shared, look down And smile upon the offering which each day I offer for his sake; if yet on earth, Weary he wander, strengthen and support; If thought of me add to his happiness Keep it alive, and if it be regret, Let me fade gently, like a pleasant dreamâ Sweet, but too faint to rest on memory! Ifâbut, oh, no, not even in my prayers Can I name death. â[Sound of approaching steps. Some one approaches, and I cannot bear My quiet moment broken. â[She retires up the stage. Enter Castruccio muffled, and a Florentine Spy. CASTRUCCIO. I understand their plan; Florence will aid the strongest. FLORENTINE. Such is her policy; her wishes take her Upon the noble's side. CASTRUCCIO. It matters notâ One victory more, and I can name my terms; It is the secret stratagem I seek; For that I look to thee-henceforth we meet Within this church; few ever come this way. FLORENTINE. To-morrow look for tidings from the camp. CASTRUCCIO. I or Cesario will meet you here At this same hour. Here is your promised gold. FLORENTINE. Thanks; I will be secret as the grave. [Exit. CASTRUCCIO. I loathe the tools that I perforce must use; For sooner would I hang yon knave than pay him. Crime takes no shape so base as treachery, And yonder slave betrays his city's council For a few ducats; but the time will come, When, strong in Lucca's cause, I shall not need Such an unworthy means; the slave and spy Belong to tyranny, and freedom works With nobler instruments. Going out, Claricha returns, they meet face to face, and recognize each other. CASTRUCCIO. My loved, my lost, my beautiful Claricha! CLARICHA. Oh! wake me not, Amino, if I dream. CASTRUCCIO. Amino! how that name recalls my youth! But whence art thou? when last I sought our home, There was no vestige of the humble roof That was the shelter of our early years. I only found a heap of blacken'd ashes O'er which the green weeds had begun to trail. CLARICHA. You had not left us but a few sad months, When, burnt and plunder'd by the Florentines, Our village 'mid its vineyards lay in ruins; The aid from Lucca sent, arrived too late To save our homes; but to the chief Arrezi I owe my life, and, placed by him, I dwelt Long with a noble lady of his house, Who loved me like the children she had lost. CASTRUCCIO. The Count Arrezi! strange we never met. CLARICHA. I have not been three days in Luccaâdeath Left me once more alone in this cold world. Again the Count Arrezi was my friend, And placed me with his daughter, who is soon To wed the Count Castruccio. CASTRUCCIO. I am he. CLARICHA. Amino! CASTRUCCIO. Oh, breathe that name againâlet it recall All that my youth once dream'd of hope and love! Or rather let me hear that name no more, It is the death-knell of all happiness. CLARICHA. Alas, I dare not question; yet, one wordâ Have you forgotten me? CASTRUCCIO. Forgotten what was dearest to my soul! CLARICHA. Alas, how may that be, if Count Castruccio And my Amino be the same? CASTRUCCIO. Evil and bitter were my early years: Exiled in childhood, sought for but to slay, I only re-assumed our ancient name, When, gathering all the remnants of our cause, I raised the banner of our line, and came A conquerorâwho but only came to spare. CLARICHA. I would that I had earlier known your name. CASTRUCCIO. How bitterly I mock the pride that kept My birth a secret; yet 'twas not all pride, I plann'd a glad surprise for her I loved; In the first dawn of my success, I sought The well-remember'd vineyards. CLARICHA. Farewell, Count Castruccio! had I known The name whose triumphs fill our Italy, I had not hoped as I have done for years; But I should still have loved: it does not need That words should say, the nameless, friendless girl Is nothing to the Lord of Lucca. CASTRUCCIO. Weary and hard has been my path through life; Its brief success by danger has been bought, Yet knew I not its bitterness till now. CLARICHA. Farewell, my lord. CASTRUCCIO. Hear me, Clarichaâbe yourself my judgeâ What Lucca was, let our first years recall: Years past in war and exileâwhen the land Had not one vineyard safeâone hearth secureâ How stands my country now?âat peace within, The peasant, undisturb'd beneath his vine, The citizen in safety, high or low, While our fair banners flout the gates of Florence. Not for the fair banners flout the gates of Florence. Not for the palace only have I ruled, But for the green fields and the market place; Peace dwells beneath the shadow of my power. CLARICHA. Ah, me! I know too well how much Castruccio Has done for Lucca. CASTRUCCIO. I have given youth, And love, and hope, to be her sacrifice. From the first hour that Lucca own'd my sway, I only look'd to her prosperity: The heart went with her that now turns aside; On one side dost thou stand and happiness, But on the other, danger, toil, and care. CLARICHA. And duty! CASTRUCCIO. A heavy duty girdles me around; Arrezi's daughter has my plighted honour: For Lucca's sake was the alliance sought, To bind her father's party to my side. A darker power than mine impels me onâ For the first time I hesitate, and fain I would recall my purpose. CLARICHA. Not for me; Look on yon heaven, Castruccio, and think Of thine own glorious future. CASTRUCCIO. Has life no service I could render thee? CLARICHA. What is there I could ask of thee but love? CASTRUCCIO. I cannot part with thee: I had forgotten That there were sweet and gentle thoughts in life; Let me do something for thy sake, my loved one. CLARICHA. Oh, death, this is thy agony! CASTRUCCIO. The council will have metâI must away; Who could restrain my followers in their fear If I were missing? but not yet farewell, I have so much to say, so much to ask. We meet again, Claricha; I must seek At least to be thy friend; we meet again. CLARICHA. Alas! why should we meet? it is in vain. CASTRUCCIO. I cannot choose, my heart beats quick with joy: Youth, hope, and tenderness return with thee. CLARICHA. For thine own sake, Castruccio, fare-thee-well. CASTRUCCIO. Stay yet one moment; if thou didst but know How faithfully this heart has kept thy name, Its sad and secret music; years have past Since the green vineyards heard our youthful vow; Hurried our parting word, and parting kiss, But not less sacred. In my first career Thou wert my hope, my star of enterpriseâ When I look'd forward, 'twas to look to thee. CLARICHA. And now we meet, and know that we must part, Unpitying fate! why met we not before? CASTRUCCIO. My exile was repeal'd, but ere I sought My native city, I did seek for thee; Instead of sunny welcome in thine eyes, I found but desolation and despair: Dark night, and its eternal echoes, gave The only answer when I call'd thy name. CLARICHA. Oh! if we had but met. CASTRUCCIO. Fate mocks at us; a few brief hours suffice To stand between us and our happiness, Thenceforth I had those gentle hopes no more, That make the spirit gentle where they dwell. Lucca was then my allâI had no hopes But for the glory of my native city; To see her free and prosperous, became Life's sole great object. CLARICHA. Not for my sake shall Lucca's hero pause Upon his glorious path; not for my sake Forget life's noblest duties. CASTRUCCIO. Thou art more strong than I amâyet not so, I see thy cheek is pale, thine eye is wet, I cannot leave thee. Enter Cesario hastily. CESARIO. I pray your pardon, but the need is great; The late attempt fills all your friends with fear, Not mine to check their angry eagerness, Which now is fain to seek thee, sword in hand. CASTRUCCIO. To stay is madness now; my brief delay May be atoned in blood. Love, now farewell. CESARIO. I pray you, lady, urge his speed. CLARICHA. Farewell! farewell! CASTRUCCIO. Meet me again, Claricha, meet me here; Here, with high Heaven, and the dead around, Fit for farewell like ours. Sternly I feel The pressure of my duty to the land, Whose people are entrusted to my keeping; But I cannot part with thee, and know so little Of thy uncall'd-for future. CESARIO. Good, my lord. CASTRUCCIO. Claricha, most beloved, I dare not stay, With life on every moment, bid me go. CLARICHA. Farewell. CASTRUCCIO. We meet to-morrow; every gentle saint Watch over thee. Farewell. â[Exeunt. Claricha. (Stands looking after him, and then turns suddenly and kneels before the Madonna). At least I still may pray for him. â[Scene closes. END OF THE SECOND ACT. ACT III. Scene I. âA Banquetting Hall opening into a garden, and hung with pictures.âServants.âCount Arrezi. ARREZI (Solus). I have but little heart for this gay banquet: Dangers and fears encompass me around; I know the Castrucani doubts my faith, I know Leoni loathes the coming marriage, Which never will his fiery spirit see Without a struggle; and with that must come All that I thought to shun of strife and blood. Ah! there are moments, when my thoughts have ask'd The heart that beats with themâcan this be life? This gulf of troubled waters, where the soul, Like a vex'd bark, is toss'd upon the waves Of pain and pleasure, by the warring breath Of passions, like the winds that drive it on, And only to distraction.â [Sees Claricha coming from the garden. Ah! she comes; The gentle orphan, whose sweet sight more soothes My troubled soul, than aught in this wide world. I love her, for I know she needs my love, And something in her sadness suits with mine. Enter Claricha. Welcome, my child! but how is thisâthe tears Are in thine eyes Sweet one, why hast thou wept? CLARICHA. My spirits are not good, my lord. ARREZI. Thou art full young for sadness. CLARICHA. Ah, my lord, 'Tis not the old alone who know that life Has but a weary way. ARREZI. My gentle childâ For ev'n as a child art thou to meâ Our life has many sorrows: and I think Most bitterly is sorrow felt in youth. Age comes and brings indifference: I grieve Not as I used to grieveâI know the worst Is but a painful dream that soon must pass. CLARICHA. Would I could think so! ARREZI. Believe me, maiden, could we read the past In every heart, we should recoil to find What weight of misery has been endured. CLARICHA. Ah me! unequal are the lots in life. ARREZI. More nearly are they balanced than we deem; The outward life shows not the life within. I am about to welcome in these walls The Count Castruccio, and he is received As the affianced lover of my daughter; The crowd will only see the pomp and power, And know not how the irrevocable past Rises in all its darkness on my soul. I hate the Castrucani's iron house. CLARICHA. Hate them, my lord? ARREZI. Is it the sadness in those gentle eyes That suits my mood? but in thee, my fair child, Is that which, winning on my confidence, Soothes the old sorrow which it seems to share. Since that first hour, when but a trembling girl I met thee flying from the Florentines, My heart warm'd to thee as thou wert my own. Perhaps it is that in thy face and voice There is a touch that brings again the face, The voice, that once made heaven on earth to me. 'Twas but a dream of youth! CLARICHA. Can such dreams pass? ARREZI. Oh, never wholly can they be forgotten: Good cause have I to hate the Castrucani! I loved the loveliest lady of their line, And wedded her in secret. Brief the space That fate allow'd our moonlit happinessâ We were surprised together. From that hour A settled darkness hangs upon her fate. The drug or dagger did their fatal work So secretly, that not a trace was left. A dungeon was my shareâfor three long years They held me captive, I escaped the third, But never could I learn my lady's doom! CLARICHA. Ah! such a parting well might break the heart. ARREZI. Time brings strange chances, when a child of mine Weds with the Castrucaniâbut in vain Age seeks to struggle with its destiny; I'm worn and wearyâall I seem to wish Is but a little rest before I die. CLARICHA. Speak not so mournfully, my own kind friend, Think how affection girdles you around, How gratitude puts up its prayer to heaven, Whene'er the orphan names Arrezi's name. ARREZI. My own sweet child, would thou wert truly mine! I've sadden'd where at first we meant to cheer. We'll talk of grief no more; I pray you cast Your eye around, and see that all be set In fair array. I must now seek Leoniâ (going.) I had forgotten what I meant to sayâ You and Bianca must be brave to-night. I bade my pages carry to your chamber Some toys and gauds I trust will please your fancy. Claricha. You are too kind. ARREZI. Nay, I am only glad To give so slight a pleasure. [Exit. CLARICHA. It is in vainâI cannot fix my thoughts On aught but him. Amino, no, Castruccio! How have I pray'd for years that we might meetâ We meet, and only meet to part for ever. I know not what I look uponâall things Repeat his likenessâI can hear his voice, Or is it but the beating of my heart? The Count Leoni here? Let me escape, I could not bear his idle gallantry. â(Looks round.) This column will conceal me. Enter the Count Leoni, followed by Arrezi. ARREZI. It is too desperate! LEONI. So are our fortunes! We are the ladders of Castruccio's greatness, Used, then flung down. ARREZI. Nay, we must rise with him. LEONI. One of our noble house should scorn such rise; Ancestral is our hatred, dark with time! And seal'd on either side with blood. To-day Cannot undo the work of many years. ARREZI. Where are the well-laid schemes of yesterday? LEONI. Lost by your own weak fears: he should have died. Castruccio's only prison is the grave! ARREZI. But still to slay himâcoming as my guest In my own hallsâ LEONI. The strong may choose their time, The weak take opportunity to strike. ARREZI. I cannotâdare not. LEONI. Dare not, is the word; I'll dare for both. Now listen, uncle mine; Bianca is my own betrothed bride! Castruccio shall not wed her; that alone Were cause enough to float these halls with blood: He is our house's ancient enemy, And, but for him, no citizen would dare Raise hand against the nobles; he must die! ARREZI. But yet some fitter time. LEONI. The hour for action is the present hour! Defeat and danger wait upon delay. Castruccio will be here to-night, unarm'd, His surest friends beside him; they will fall, None to avenge. Our friends are all prepared; A secret band of Florentines now lie In ambush by the city's western gate, Whose keeper I have gain'd. I haste to seek them Bearing the orders of the Count Gonsalvi, Who'll meet them at the gate and lead them on. Castruccio slainâthe people overawed, Henceforth our triumph is secure. ARREZI. It will be bought too dearly. LEONI. Danger will only heighten our success. ARREZI. 'Tis not the danger, 'tis the treachery. LEONI. I've heard the treachery of the Castrucani Gave you three years of prison in your youth. ARREZI. Do not recall that bitter time again. LEONI. I must recall its memoryâlet it cry For vengeance at our hands. I will away; Short time is mine to reach the Florentines, And yet return to grace the festival: My entrance at the banquet is the signal! ARREZI. Castruccio may miss you from the halls Whose heir should be the first to bid him welcome! LEONI. A little colouring gives truth to falsehood, Tell him I'm jealous of Bianca's smile. ARREZI. Butâ LEONI. Buts are the stumbling-blocks of enterprise, We will not have them. ARREZI. The risk is fearfulâdo not think Castruccio Will yield without a struggle. How can I Stand by and see him murder'd? LEONI. Out on such scruples! Hear me, Count Arrezi! Go to Castruccio's feet, and tell him all; Give up your kinsmen and your ancient friends, And henceforth be his vassal. For ourselves, We are prepared to die, though not prepared To perish by your act. ARREZI. You know no death could tempt me to betray you. LEONI. You have your choiceâhis life or ours! ARREZI. Leoni, I am now a man in years, Broken and wayworn, and I lack the force To lead or stem the tide of your fierce spirits; On either hand is death! LEONI. That of your friends and foes is at your choice. ARREZI. I have no choice. LEONI. Then, neither can you be responsible. But now I must awayâtime hurries on, One parting wordâbe calm and resolute. [Exit. ARREZI. Hear me one moment more! (Follows him.) CLARICHA (Coming forward). Thank God, I have heard all! oh, give me strength To fly and save him! [Exit. Scene II. âA small Chamber looking to the Street. Enter Claricha, hastily. CLARICHA. All egress is forbidden from the palace, They will not let me forth, and he must die! I must behold him murder'd in my sight! Can I not watch, when first he comes, and speak At once my words of warning in his ear? Too late, the armed traitors will be nigh: Can I not save him? I, who would lay down My life to save him? Pitying heaven, look down And aid me in this hopeless misery. (After a pause.) These windows look upon the streetâa scroll Might save him yetâit is a desperate chance! Still, if it reach his hand, he were in safety. (She approaches the table, and writes.) Be still, thou coward hand! thou shalt not tremble. (She writes.) 'Tis doneâthese few brief words suffice To warn Castruccio of the coming danger. (She folds the letter.) Holy Madonna, have it in thy care! (She attempts to throw it out, the wind blows it back again.) 'Tis too lightâ'twill never reach the street; (She looks anxiously round.) It should be heavyâheavy as my heart! Oh, nothing!ânothing, if I had but here One of those daggers soon to drink his blood! (Suddenly recollecting, she puts her hand to her throat.) 'Tis here, the chain I have from childhood worn! My only relic of the unknown past. But let it goâit will weigh down the scrollâ (She makes up the packet. Now heav'n speed it that it reach Castruccio! (She flings it from the window.) It fallsâI see it lying in the street. Now all depends on who may find it first. Star of his glorious hour, send thou some friend! Let but a noble pass, and he is lost! A common citizen draws near the spot; He sees the packetâtakes itâreads the name, And hurries to the Castrucani palace. I know yon street leads straight unto its gates; Oh God, I thank thee! (Sinks exhausted by the window; the scene closes.) Scene III. âA Hall in one of the Palaces. Leoni, and several Nobles. 1ST NOBLE. I would you had been with us yesterday. LEONI. To-day will serve us better; for to-day Has yesterday's experience. 1ST NOBLE. We were wrong To trust the people and the light of day; Now secret night is round our enterprise, And we will be as secret. LEONI. All now rests Upon your own good swords and with yourselves. 2ND NOBLE. If that the matter rested with my sword I were contentâthat were a soldier's part. Midnight assassins are we now! LEONI. Actions are ever judged by their success; To-morrow sees us paramount in Lucca; The doom to-night dealt on the Castrucani Will then be rightful justice 1ST NOBLE. We have no choice: it is his fall or ours, And I, for one, care little if my sword Or if my dagger end an enemy. LEONI. We are degraded by the Castrucani; Our order has not left one privilege Beyond the meanest citizen. 2ND NOBLE. He talks, too, of dismissing our retainers. LEONI. 'Tis the old fable of the lion's claws, But we must re-assert our ancient rule; Assert it now or never, for I know The emperor's envoys are upon their way To own the Castrucani Lord of Lucca, But they must find us masters! 1ST NOBLE. Your entrance at the banquet is our signal? LEONI. Yes, and I ask one favour; let my dagger Be that which strikes Castruccio! ALL. Agreed! LEONI. Our time is precious; to your care, Count Ludolph, I will commend my uncle: he is old, And weak, and fearfulâsee he falter not. You, Count Rinaldo, have our followers arm'd, And meet me secret in the cypress-grove; I'll wait there, coming from the Florentines. Our forces and their band must join at once; This fix'd, we'll seek the banquet-room together. My welcome to Castruccio is my dagger! 1ST NOBLE. One cup of wine, Leoni, ere you go. LEONI. I have not timeâyet stayâwe'll drink one pledge. (They pour out wine; each takes a goblet.) Death to the Castrucani! ALL. Death to the Castrucani! LEONI. And now awayâawayâfor life and death Is on the hour! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT. ACT IV. Scene I. âThe same Hall as before, but now illuminated, hung with Pictures, &amp;c. Count Arrezi, Bianca, Claricha, Guests, &amp;c. Claricha anxiously watching the groups as they enter. ARREZI. Welcome, my friends! (After two or three greetings.) (Aside.) We cannot now recede, they come prepared. CLARICHA (Aside). He comes not! 1ST NOBLE. You've spared, good count, no cost upon your banquet. (Aside.) Wear not that moody brow, to-night is ours. ARREZI (Aside.) Alas! that this must be.â(Aloud.)âThe count is late. 1ST NOBLE. We're used to wait the Count Castruccio's pleasure. CLARICHA (Aside). Perhaps he may not come! ARREZI. Fair ladies, will you dance? (A dance.) CLARICHA (Aside). Each moment gives me hope he may not come. ARREZI. You stand apart; will you not dance my child? CLARICHA. I am not well. (Aside.)âOh, Heaven, he comes! Enter Castruccio, Cesario, and Attendants. ARREZI. Welcome, my noble guest! CLARICHA (Aside). The chain is round his neck. CASTRUCCIO. Thanks for your courtesy. The fair Bianca! BIANCA. You're welcome, signor. 1ST NOBLE (Aside). The victim, now, is safe within our toils! ARREZI. You're late, my lord. CASTRUCCIO. I pray your pardon, 'twas no fault of mine! 1ST NOBLE. It was our pride and pleasure to expect. CLARICHA (Aside). I see he is prepared; his eagle eye Flashes, as, when a boy, he spoke of danger. Enter Servant. The banquet waits, my lord. ARREZI (Aside). There can be no delay, 1ST NOBLE (Aside). And no misgiving! ARREZI. Our banquet's ready, Please you, Count Castruccio, To lead Bianca? CASTRUCCIO. Your pardon, lady, for a brief delay; Let me look round this hall, I knew it not. ARREZI. 'Tis never open'd but when some high guest Honours us with his presence; and we ask Our ancestors to aid us in his greeting. CASTRUCCIO. I like the custom. It is from the dead The living must their noblest lessons learn; The dead are as the stars that light the past: We see how time has honoured them, and hope Ourselves for equal honour. 1ST NOBLE. True my good lord. (Aside to Arrezi.) Why dost thou look so scared? CASTRUCCIO. The name of every noble ancestor's A bond upon the soul against disgrace! 'Tis no vain pride that looketh to their honours, And taketh thence a high security That we prove not unworthy of such names. ARREZI (Aside). I cannot bear this. (Aloud.) The banquet waits! CASTRUCCIO. A little while, I pray you, let it wait. I like this gallery muchâour history, Our Lucca's history, is on its walls; Her noblest, and her bravest, and her best, Keep the time-honour'd life of memory. Now, if a man had plann'd some low vile deed, He dared not act it here. 1st Noble (Aside). Can he suspect? (Aloud.) Some men are resolute. CASTRUCCIO. Yonder is one who reign'd our doge in Lucca; 'Tis now some fifty yearsâI know the face. The public monument the public raised In gratitude for a long life of service. His statue looks upon the town he ruled, An honour unto both. It is the past Redeems the present, and that bids us look To the dim future with a lofty hope. Cold and unworthy were the actual hours, If they look'd only to themselves; but life Is conscious of its immortality, Urged by high dutyâanimate by power; The present, in the shadow of the past, Learns what it owes the future. The sage, the hero, leave their great example Heroic guides upon a glorious path; They are the lights by which we shape our course, Only by looking up can we see Heav'n. 1ST NOBLE. You're eloquent, my lord! ARREZI (Aside). I'll try to save him, and must see Leoni. (Aloud.) Our guests await your pleasure. CASTRUCCIO. I pray their pardon: but who is yon knight Clad in white armour? ARREZI. Our house's chiefest honour; when the Moors Made him a prisoner, on his plighted word, So high they held the Count Vitelli's name, They let him seek his native land to raise The ransom which they set. He found his lands Impoverish'd like the state, and could not raise The heavy sum required. In vain 'twas urged Small faith was needed with the Infidel; But he return'd, taking his chains again, And died a captive. CASTRUCCIO. And, in the presence of this noble knight, Who looks in visible scorn upon ye now, Your ancestor, Arrezi, have you plann'd To violate all hospitable rites! ARREZI. Count Castruccio! CASTRUCCIO. A cowardly assassin; but in vain. (He stamps; his Guard comes in.) 1ST NOBLE. We sell our lives full dearly! (Springs at Castruccio, who strikes his sword from his hand.) CASTRUCCIO. Take them to prison; ladies, by your leave, This is no place for you. (Addressing one of them.) Madam, I give the Count Arrezi's daughter To your kind charge and honourable keeping; We never meet again! [Exeunt. Claricha eowes forward. CASTRUCCIO (Not knowing her). Lady, I crave your absence. CLARICHA. I only stay to ask my chain again. CASTRUCCIO (Recognising her). Your chain! My own Claricha, have you been Lucca's good angelâsweet preserver, mine! Take back your chain, and, with it, take my heart And its entire allegiance. Oh! sweet love, This is no time to pour my heart in words, Yet happiness must ask a moment's space. Saved, and by thee! CLARICHA. Ah! would I not lay down my life for thine? CASTRUCCIO. Like a good angel's gift I hold the life Which thou hast rescued; it must be for good: Life's sweetest hopes return again with thee. Mine once againâmy own, long lost Claricha! This very evening I reproach'd my fate; To meet thee still the beautiful, the true, And yet resign thee, was too hard a task! I question'd with my honour, and I falter'd In the stern path of right: but I am now So happy, my Claricha! CLARICHA. Would I might ever make thy happiness! CASTRUCCIO. One wordâwhere does my sweet one make her home? CLARICHA. With Count Arrezi. CASTRUCCIO. With mine enemy! CLARICHA. No longer such; henceforward bound to thee By a free pardon. CASTRUCCIO. I cannot pardon him. CLARICHA. Not pardon him, Castruccio, for my sake? CASTRUCCIO. I cannot pardon him for Lucca's sake! CLARICHA. One moment hear me: oh! Castruccio, think How kind the count has been; my one true friend! An orphanâpity was my only claim; It was enough with himâI owe him all Of fond affection's care; but for that care I were not here to kneel and ask for mercy. CASTRUCCIO. Kneel not to me; ah! listen, dearest mine! CLARICHA. Will you not pay my debt of gratitude? CASTRUCCIO. Ask for my life, Claricha, it is thine! But ask not for the lives which others trust Safe to my charge; think not that I refuse Arrezi's life because he sought for mine; I have no anger for my private wrong: But there are those in Lucca who need warning, And they shall have it. With the traitor's head A thousand plots fall harmless from the scaffold. CLARICHA. Nothing disarms an enemy like pardon. CASTRUCCIO. Not when they think the pardon wrung from fear. Ancient oppressionâpresent treacheryâ Alike demand example. At our gates Gather the foreign foe; they must not hope For aid within our walls: I have long tried A gentle rule of patienceâ'tis no more. Plead not with those sad eyes, the count must die! CLARICHA. I do implore you by our ancient love! CASTRUCCIO. Oh! do not think that when I take this hand I link it to a calm and happy lot; You will share with me sacrifice and pain. For power, it is an awful thing, and stands Girt by stern duties. Not to thy sweet tears May I yield up one staid and solemn purpose; Once have I pardon'd: but, to pardon twice, Were weakness, and not mercy. He must die! CLARICHA. Castruccio! CASTRUCCIO. Not where my heart has chosen must it find Unrest and womanish complaint; weep, love, Kindly and natural tears; but still remember Lucca has my first duty. Cesario, wait. Farewell, love! within a few short hours We'll meet again; when I shall ask from thee More justice to mine act. [Exit. CLARICHA. It is my hand has slain him; he, my friend, My kindâmy only friend. Is there no hope? I did not urge him earnestly enoughâ I did not tell him he would lose my love Unless he heard my desperate pray'rs for mercy. Oh! never shall I know a quiet hour Again in life, unless Arrezi live; His memory will haunt me like a ghost, Pale and perpetual at my side, with eyes That never turn aside their sad reproach. I'll after him, and wring a slow consent. CESARIO. Your pardon, lady; do not seek the count, Let his just anger cool; think you how false, How vile has been Arrezi's part to-night! With flattering words he pray'd Castruccio's presence, Made his own child the lure, yet, in his heart, Lurk'd the assassin, and he plann'd to make His homeâhis sacred homeâthe place for murder! CLARICHA. It is too trueâbut he was urged by others. CESARIO. Lady, it does not justify our crime, Saying that others prompted us to sin. CLARICHA. Alas! alas! I cannot think of him But as he was to meâa kind old man, The only friend my orphan girlhood knew. Oh! I must see him; I must kneel and weep Before his feetâhe cannot pardon meâ Yet let me ask forgiveness. Gentle youth, Conduct me to the prison. CESARIO. 'Twill need an order to allow your entrance. CLARICHA. Seek ye Castruccio; he will not refuse, And I, meanwhile, must weep and pray. Oh! Fate, How thou dost mock us! I have met Castruccio, The prayer of many years has been fulfill'd; We love with that true love we vow'd at parting, Yet my full heart sinks down with misery. My kindâmy only friendâoh! gentle youth, Haste, for sweet pity's sake. [Exeunt. Scene II. âPart of a Garden. Leoni pacing backwards and forwards. LEONI. There is no cloud upon the placid sky, There is no motion in the drooping leaves; I neither like this waiting nor this stillness. Too much the rest of this still night contrasts The unrest that is feverish in my soul! The midnight, with its pale and mournful moon, That wanders, like an orphan, through the heavens, Companionless, with its dark boughs, that seem Still as the heavy shadows which they fling, This hour is not for enterprise. The heart Mocks its own projects and its own designs, So little, with eternal night around, So worthless, gazing on those distant worlds. Why, what vain fantasies are these to cross My mind at such a time! but we are toys E'en to ourselves. Where can Rinaldo stay? The banquet hour is pastâAh! here he comes. Enter 2nd Noble hastily. You come full late, my lord 2ND NOBLE. I come too soon; Despair and danger are my comrades here! LEONI. What can you mean? 2ND NOBLE. Mean? that Castruccio's friend Has stood him in good stead; he came prepared, Knowing the welcome that he was to meet. Your uncle and his friends are now in prison, Condemn'd to death. LEONI. The Count Arrezi prisoner! 2ND NOBLE. Ayeâand his shadow falls upon his grave, He stands so near to it. Just now I pass'd Beside the market-place; the midnight rang With the loud hammer's blow, and with the saw Grating its sullen path way through the wood Which is to raise the scaffold for to-morrow. Arrezi there will be the first to die. LEONI. Not if my life can ransom his. 'Twas I Who urged the old man onâwith sneer and threat I silenced his misgivings. 2ND NOBLE. What can we do? LEONI. Rather than let that old man die, I'd kneel Before the Castrucani, and give up My head as fitting ransom. 2ND NOBLE. You would but only add another victim. We have no choice but flight. LEONI. I will not fly, Though I but stay'd to share Arrezi's scaffold. 2ND NOBLE. Live for revengeâa better hour may come. LEONI. Revenge is all too distant; I will save Or perish! 2ND NOBLE. I tell you all is known; what can avail A single arm? LEONI. 'Tis to that single arm that I must trust. There yet remains one soleâone desperate chanceâ The risk is mine. (Drawing his dagger.) This blade has stood, ere now, My certain friend. (Sheathing it.)âI'll trust to it again. 2ND NOBLE. Castruccio's guards are gather'd round his palace; And, if some cunning tale could win your entrance, You'd perish, ev'n as you struck the blow. A hundred swords would straight avenge his death. LEONI. I'd brave them all, Rinaldo, in such cause; But mine's a far more subtle stratagem. 2ND NOBLE. Your stratagems have not avail'd us much. LEONI. The chances of the game have turn'd against us, And I will pay the forfeit with my head, Unless I turn them yet again. 2ND NOBLE. There's something in your courage raises mine; I'll follow you. LEONI. That suits not with my scheme: take you this ring, And hurry with it to the Florentines, Who lay in ambush near the ruin'd tower; Hasten their march; I did not wish their aid Until our party muster'd in its strength: But now, our life and death hangs on their speed. Hence, good Rinaldo. 2ND NOBLE. Not till I know your purpose for yourself. Half of the danger is my proper share. LEONI. On my right hand alone I must rely. You may remember, in our boyish days My father held the Castrucani palaceâ The Castrucani were themselves in exile; I know each turn and windingâthere was one, A secret passage leading to the city, And from the very room which now Castruccio Makes his own private chamberâleave that way, And, Fortune, I will worship thee again. 2ND NOBLE. Methinks that Fortune owes us some amends For past ill-favour. LEONI. We must away; each moment that we lose Brings my old kinsman nearer to the scaffold. Off to the Florentines! Now life and death Hang on an hour's chance. [Exeunt different ways. END OF THE FOURTH ACT. ACT V. Scene I. âA Prison. Arrezi and the Confessor. ARREZI. Thou bring'st my youth again; thou who didst link Her faith to mineâthe lost and the beloved. Fateful to me has been thy ministering; It has been thine, oh! ancient priest, to bless My marriage and my scaffold! CONFESSOR. Not on the past, my son, fix thou thy thoughts, But on the solemn future! ARREZI. I cannot choose: I sought thee out for years. Give me to know her fateâmy secret brideâ Soon lost, but long belovedâand I will turn From thee to thy companionâdeath! CONFESSOR. When the proud Castrucani forced thy bride To secret banishment, and made thee prisoner, Chance brought me to the village, and I watch'd Above her and her childâ ARREZI. Her child! CONFESSOR. It was two years before the mother died; With her last breath she gave her to my charge. ARREZI. What of the orphan? CONFESSOR. For years I saw her grow in loveliness, And deem'd her happy in her lowly state; For Lucca was distracted with the wars Her nobles kept among themselves. ARREZI. I dreadâyet still must askâdoes my child live? CONFESSOR. But that it breaks a link with this sad world, My heart would fail meâno, the girl is dead! She had just sprung to blooming womanhood, When Heaven claim'd its own. The Florentines Burnt Arola, the village where she dwelt; Not one escaped to tell the tale of death! ARREZI. Oh, subtle force of nature's secret love! That child, although I knew her not for mine, Has been my care; I have reproach'd myself That more my heart drew to her than Bianca: Our house almost enforced my second marriage. I wedded with a lady cold and proud, Who left her likeness to her childâBianca Ne'er sought, ne'er won affection like Claricha; Would I might bless her ere I die. CONFESSOR. Alas! my son, think not on human ties. Enter Claricha. ARREZI. And hast thou sought me out, my own sweet child? Come to your father's heart! 'twas Heaven and nature That made me love thee, ere I knew thy right To claim a parent's love. How hard it is To only know thee in this last sad hour! Shrink not away, my childâI am thy father! CLARICHA. My father! CONFESSOR. She wears the very chain around her neck Placed by her dying mother. Start not thus, But kneel and ask a father's latest blessing. CLARICHA. Mercyâmercy. ARREZI. In evil times we meet; but still, my child, Come to my heartâClaricha, let me bless thee! CLARICHA. Curse meâyour blessing sinks me to the earth: Curse meâand in me curse your murderer! ARREZI. Cease these wild words, you know not what you say. CLARICHA. I know too well: I gave the Count Castruccio The tidings of his danger. ARREZI. You told Castruccio! CONFESSOR. Unhappy girl! CLARICHA. I told Castruccioâin our early youth We met and loved; the burning of our village Lost us each other's trace; again we metâ That very day I overheard your scheme, And gave him warning. ARREZI. I cannot blame thee. CLARICHA. He loves meâoh! he cannot let me dieâ Die with a parent's blood upon my soul! He did not know of thisâyes, there is hope. ARREZI. Hope! CLARICHA. My fatherâlet me call thee by that nameâ My father, bless meâbless thy wretched child! Oh, try to say one word of comfort to me! I come to seek thy pardon. (Kneels.) ARREZI. I blame our evil destiny, and feel 'Tis my own crime has brought down Heaven's vengeance; I dare not say I pardon thee, Claricha, But take thy father's blessing; my last prayer Shall be for thee! CLARICHA. Either I bring thy pardon, or I die; I seek Castruccio: never will I rise From kneeling at his feet, until I win Forgiveness for my father. Once, again, I pray thee bless me. ARREZI. Come to my heart? (They embrace.) CLARICHA. Now, pitying Heaven assist me. â[Exit. CONFESSOR. Let us now seek the inner cell, and pray. ARREZI. She must succeed; I feel My heart beat quick with hope.âI follow thee. [Exeunt. Scene II. âCastruccio alone in his Chamber, writing. CASTRUCCIO. There is a heavy weight upon my heart That I would fling aside, yet cannot fling; But that I hold all such presentments vain, I should think there was evil on this hour. Yet where should be the evil? yonder star That brings the golden promise of the day, Is, as my fortunes, rising to their noon. Victory bears my crimson banner onwards; Love nestles in its shadow; and, subdued, Mine enemies are prostrate at my feet. Bear witness, Lucca! in this silent hour, That my first thought is thine; I have not ask'd A transitory name for thee or me; My conquests have but sought to keep our gates Steadfast against a foreign foe; within Have I kept order and security. The iron power, made selfish by the few, Have I subdued, and temper'd in its use. The citizens have learnt to know their strength, And in that strength lies freedom. (The panel at the back begins to open, and Leoni appears. He advances towards Castruccio, who starts, but instantly composes himself, and appears occupied by the papers on the table.) CASTRUCCIO (Aside). I hear the secret lock I thought none knew Turn in the panel, and I hear a step; It is too stealthy for a friendly oneâ Let me be on my guardâit comes more near. I see a shadow darken on the ground: There is a dagger in the hand. I'll seem Busy among these letters while I watch. (Leoni attempts to stab him, but Castruccio springs up, and snatches the dagger.) CASTRUCCIO. The Count Leoni turn'd assassin? (Throws down the dagger.) LEONI. Now curses on the worthless hand that fail'd With life and honour trusted to its strength! CASTRUCCIO. Honour! that is no word for lip of thineâ A coward murderer in the silent night. Does not thy noble name cry shame upon thee? LEONI. It cries for vengeance! CASTRUCCIO. What cause hast thou to be my enemy? LEONI. An hundred years our houses have been foes; To that I add my individual hate. There is no path of fortune where thy step Has not cross'd mine; in war, ambition, love, Still hast thou been my rival! call thy guards, Tyrant! but, ere they come, I'll try my sword. CASTRUCCIO. I'll call no other guard than my right hand. (They fight.âAs he disarms Leoni, Cesario and the Attendants rush in.) CASTRUCCIO. Bear hence the traitor! you are just in time. CESARIO. He bleeds to death. LEONI. But yet with strength enough For hatred and defiance; 'tis in vainâ Fate is against meâcurse the hand and sword That have betray'd me in my utmost need! Yet hark, Castruccio! thou hast many foesâ Dagger and cup are armed against thy life! And with my dying breath I bid them speed. But I am dizzyânoâI dare not leave Word for my kind old kinsman or Bianca: Now can I neither save, nor yet revenge. CESARIO. Die with more christian words upon your lips, For the dear sake of thy immortal soul! Leoni (springing up for a moment). I'll peril it on my last wordâI hate him! (Dies.) CASTRUCCIO. Bear him away, and instantly prepare Arrezi's scaffold; I will make my power Show itself fearful: they must learn my strength. [Exeunt Attendants bearing the body. CESARIO. Can you be hurt my lord? you look so pale. CASTRUCCIO. I am more sad than is my wont, Cesario! My hand has slain yon traitor, but he once Was my familiar friendâyet scarce my friend, For friendship asks as much as loveâof faithâ Of mingling qualities and confidence; Friends, then, we were not, but such gay companions As are remember'd pleasant in our age; They wear the freshness of our youth about them, And bring back hours untramell'd by a care! Many a midnight have we pass'd together In glad carousal, when the purple cup Gave its own gaiety; we've fought together, 'Neath the same banner was our earliest field! We've sat beside the watch-fire half the night, Talking of friends and of our native city, Yet yonder doth he lie, slain by my hand! CESARIO. Better ten thousand perish'd such as he, Than peril life so dear as your's to Lucca. CASTRUCCIO. Luccaâthat is the watchword of my heart! My native city! you are young, Cesario, And do not know with how intense a love The exile clingeth to his mother earth. I was an exile onceâand Lucca rose Each night more beautiful among my dreams; Each day a deeper longing seized my soul To see her walls once more; at length I came, And found disorder, tyranny and death! It matters not to tell you of my youth; Enough, it left me with no home-affection, None of those gentler ties that fill the thoughts Of other menâmy country was my all! My hopes, my fears, my future were for Lucca. CESARIO. And you have made our Lucca what she is, Peace in her streets, and victory at her gates. CASTRUCCIO. I know my powerâalas! I also know Power is a sad and solitary thing; It cuts you off from old companionship, It needeth iron heart and iron eye, For its resolves are terrible, when life Waits on your word, and when you know one breathâ One little breathâtakes what it cannot give! I yield the Count Arrezi to the axe, But have no word that could recall the blow! CESARIO. His doom is just! CASTRUCCIO. And needful; vain, indeed, my present moodâ Power must submit to its dark comradeâdeath! Attendant enters. A lady craves a moment's speech, my lord. CASTRUCCIO. Let her approach: leave us awhile, Cesario. [Exeunt. I know the step:â(Enter Claricha)âmy sweet lady here, What would she ask? CLARICHA. What thou hast once denied, A pardon for Arrezi. CASTRUCCIO. Let me entreat thy silenceâgrieve me not With useless prayers I may notâdare not grant; Thy hand is coldâyour lip is whiteâsweet love, For my sake, wear not such wild wretchedness. CLARICHA. You cannot dream what misery brings me to you; Hear me: it is my father's life I seekâ My father's! CASTRUCCIO. What does this mean? CLARICHA. You could not leave a crime upon my soul So terrible! Arrezi is my parent! CASTRUCCIO. Your parent! How is this? CLARICHA. Secret he wedded one of your proud line Who parted them, and never till this hour Knew he his wife, nor yet his orphan's fate. I am that wretched child! CASTRUCCIO. Can this be true? CLARICHA. Oh! do not cruelly waste time in doubt, But let my agony attest the truth; His lifeâmy lifeânow hang upon a word. Be merciful, Castruccio! speak that word, Or see me die before you! CASTRUCCIO. There is no doubt? CLARICHA. Noneânone! Now, by our love, I do implore you! He was my benefactor and my friendâ He is my father! CASTRUCCIO. I cannot let her handâher innocent handâ Redden for ever with a parent's blood! Nature, thy ties are sacred, and I yield. Haste with my signet; love, your father lives, And you shall be his hostage. CLARICHA. Let my haste thank you. Oh! my noble lord, Long years of happiness reward this pardon! [Exit. Tumult without. Cesario and others rush in. CESARIO. My lord, some treachery has been at work. Through the west gate the Florentines have won Their secret entrance, and the Count Gonsalvi Raises his war-cry in our streets. CASTRUCCIO. 'Tis well; Long have I sought to meet him face to face, And now a single blow may end the war. Scene III. âThe Market-place. Citizens, &amp;c. Sound of tumult, and a bell tolling in the distance. 1ST CITIZEN. They fly before Castruccio; but a band, With Count Gonsalvi, keep the western gate. 2ND CITIZEN. They will not keep it long; the Florentines Know our Castruccio. 1ST CITIZEN. Did the prisoner pass While I was gone? 2ND CITIZEN. The moment that you left; I wait to see the body brought this way. 1ST CITIZEN. Lo! where they come. (The crowd press together; and, as the body, covered on a bier, is brought in on one side, Claricha enters at the other. The bearers set down the body.) CLARICHA. I cannot urge my wayâin Heaven's name, I pray you, let me pass. 1st Citizen. Rest you a little while, poor child, beside me: You cannot pierce the crowd. CLARICHA. I must go on; oh, for your parents' sake, Make but a little way! 1ST CITIZEN. The crowd will soon disperseâthey pause to gaze On Count Arrezi. CLARICHA. Help meâI am his childâI bring his pardon. Now, in your children'sâin your fathers' nameâ Let me pass on. 1ST CITIZEN. It is too late. (Claricha springs forward with a shriek, the crowd give way, and she reaches the bier.) CLARICHA. Who lies beneath that mantle? OFFICER. The traitor, Count Arrezi. (Claricha drops by the bier. Flourish of trumpets, acclamations.) Enter Castruccio, Gonsalvi, Florentine prisoners, Soldiers, &amp;c. Gonsalvi (offering his sword to Castruccio). Thus I yield up my sword as vanquish'd twice; Once by your arm, more by your courtesy. CASTRUCCIO. Keep it, my lord; and with it take your freedom: We only ask of victory for peace. Enter Cesario. CESARIO. The envoys of the emperor await Your leisure, to acknowledge you the lord Of Lucca. CASTRUCCIO. Then Lucca's freedom is assured. High Heaven I thank thee! (Addressing the crowd.) My friends, Not on a day of victory and peace, Shall justice sternly ask its penalty Freely ye will forgive your enemies. Last night's conspirators I pardon hereâ Be they set free. OFFICER. That has been done by death! There lies the Count Arrezi. (The crowd opens, and Claricha is seen lying by the bier.) CASTRUCCIO. Oh, miserable mockery of fate! Look up, Claricha. (She starts at his voice.) CLARICHA. His voiceâah! let it wake me from my dream. I've had a fearful dreamâCastruccio mineâ But I am safe, thus nestled in thine arms! CASTRUCCIO (attempting to bear her away). Come with me, loveâthis is no place for thee. CLARICHA (springing from him). Why am I here, and wherefore is this crowd? There's fear in every faceâthey look on me With pity or with horror, and your eyes Are not familiarâah! you turn asideâ Speak to meâsmile as you once did, Castruccioâ Still do you turn awayâwhat have I done? There are too many hereâI cannot ask youâ A strange confusion mixes up my thoughts, And at my heart there is a faint sick pain. CASTRUCCIO. Lean on me, love. CLARICHA (looking towards the bier). Who are those menâthose dark and fearful men? What do the black folds of yon mantle hide? I seem as I had look'd on them before; There is a weight upon my struggling soulâ 'Tis bloodâmy father's bloodâ It is my father murder'd by his child! (Sinks in Castruccio's arms.) GONSALVI. Give way, the lady faints! CASTRUCCIO. I tell you it is deathâlook up, my love! Silence those trumpets; ah! she doth not hear. Clarichaâmy Clarichaâso long lost, So lately foundâyouthâjoy and hope are gone! Gone, my pale beautyâwe shall love no more! CESARIO. Oh, come, my lord, all Lucca sees your tears! CASTRUCCIO. Lucca should be their witness; for her sakeâ For my fair country's sakeâI have kept down Natural emotions, young and cheerful thoughts, Yet were they warm and eager at my heart. With her they perish! Fate has claim'd the last, Cruel and terrible the sacrifice! All but my country shares Claricha's graveâ (Raising her in his arms.) This, Lucca, is my latest offering! The Curtain drops. END OF THE TRAGEDY. SUBJECTS FOR PICTURES. What seek I here to gather into words? The scenes that rise before me as I turn The pages of old times. A wordâa nameâ Conjures the past before me, till it grows More actual than the present: thatâI see But with the common eyes of daily life, Imperfect and impatient; but the past Out of imagination works its truth, And grows distinct with poetry. I. PETRARCH'S DREAM. Rosy as a waking bride By her royal lover's side, Flows the Sorgia's haunted tide Through the laurel grove,â Through the grove which Petrarch gave, All that can escape the graveâ Fame, and song, and love. He had left a feverish bed For the wild flowers at his head, And the dews the green leaves shed O'er his charmed sleep: From his hand had dropp'd the scroll To which Virgil left his soul Through long years to keep. Passion on that cheek had wrought, Its own paleness had it brought; Passion marks the lines of thought: We must feel to think. Care and toil had flung their shade Over that bright head, now laid By the river's brink. Youth that, like a fever, burns; Struggle, scorning what it earns; Knowledge, loathing as it learns; Worn and wasted heart! And a song whose secrets are In its innermost despair;â Such the poet's part! But what rises to efface Time's dark shadows from that face? Doth the heart its image trace In the morning dream? Yes; it is its light that shines Far amid the dusky pines, By the Sorgia's stream. Flowers up-springing, bright and sweet, At the pressure of their feet, As the summer came to greet Each white waving hand. Round them kindles the dark air; Golden with their golden hair, Glide a lovely band. Spirits, starry Spirits, they, That attend the radiant day, When the freed soul burst the clay Of its prison wall: Distant visions they appear; For we only dream of, here, Things etherial. But one glideth gently nigh, Human love within her eye,â Love that is too true to die,â That is heaven's own. Let the angel's first look dwell Where the mortal loved so well, Ere yet life was flown. To that angel-look was given All that ever yet from heaven Purified the earthly leaven Of a beating heart. She hath breathed of hope and love, As they warm the world above;â She must now depart. Aye, I say that love hath power On the spirit's dying hour, Sharing its immortal dower, Mastering its doom: For that fair and mystic dream By the Sorgia's hallowed stream, Kindled from the tomb. II. THE BANQUET OF ASPASIA AND PERICLES. Waken'd by the small white fingers, Which its chords obey, On the air the music lingers Of a low and languid lay From a soft Ionian lyre;â Purple curtains hang the walls, And the dying daylight falls O'er the marble pedestals Of the pillars that aspire, In honour of Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. There are statues white and solemn, Olden gods are they; And the wreath'd Corinthian column Guardeth their array. Lovely that acanthus wreath, Drooping round the graceful girth: All the fairest things of earth, Art's creations have their birthâ Still from love and death. They are gather'd for Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. There are gold and silver vases Where carved victories shine; While within the sunlight blazes Of the fragrant Teian wine, Or the sunny Cyprian isle. From the garlands on each brow Take they early roses now; And each rose-leaf bears a vow, As they pledge the radiant smile Of the beautiful Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. With the spoils of nations splendid Is that stately feast; By her youthful slaves attendedâ Beauties from the East, With their large black dewy eyes. Though their dark hair sweeps the ground, Every heavy tress is wound With the white sea-pearl around; For no queen in Persia vies With the proud Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. One hath caught mine eyeâthe fairest; 'Tis a Theban girl: Though a downcast look thou wearest, And nor flower nor pearl Winds thy auburn hair among: With a white, unsandall'd foot, Leaning languid on thy lute, Weareth thy soft lip, though mute, Smiles yet sadder than thy song. Can grief come nigh Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride? On an ivory couch reclining Doth the bride appear; In her eyes the light is shining, For her chief is near;â And her smile grows bright to gaze On the stately Pericles, Lord of the Athenian seas, And of Greece's destinies. Glorious, in those ancient days, Was the lover of Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. Round her small head, perfume breathing Was a myrtle stem, Fitter for her bright hair's wreathing Than or gold or gem; For the myrtle breathes of love. O'er her cheek so purely white, From her dark eyes came such light As is, on a summer night, With the moon above. Fair as moonlight was Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. These fair visions have departed, Like a poet's dream, Leaving us pale and faint-hearted By life's common stream, Whence all lovelier light hath fled. Not so: they have left behind Memory to the kindling mind, With bright fantasies combined. Still the poet's dream is fed By the beauty of Aspasia, The bright Athenian bride. III. RIENZI SHOWING NINA THE TOMB OF HIS BROTHER. It was hidden in a wild wood Of the larch and pine; It had been unto his childhood Solitude and shrine,â There he dream'd the hours away, On the boughs the wood-dove hover'd With her mournful song; And the ground with moss was cover'd, Where a small brook danced along Like a fairy child at play, Thither did Rienzi bring The loved and lovely one; There was the stately Nina woo'd, There was she won. Reeds and water-flags were growing By the green morass; While the fresh wild flowers were blowing In the pleasant grass, Cool and sweet, and very fair, Though the wild wind planted them With a careless wing, Yet kind Nature granted them All the gifts of Spring, Nought they needed human care. They grew lovelier in the looks Of that lovely one; While the Roman maid was woo'd, While she was won. In the pines, a soft bewailing Stirr'd the fringed leaves, Like a lute whose song is failing, Loving, while it grieves So to die upon the wind. Ivy garlanded the laurel, Drooping mournfully; Poetâwarriorâread the moral Of the victor's tree, Lonely still amid its kind! Yet what dreams of both are blent In the soft tale now begun, Which the radiant Nina woo'd, And which Nina won. There a cypress raised to heaven Its sepulchral head, Like a stately column given By the summer to the dead;â There the young Rienzi slept. In that grave his brother laid him, 'Neath the evening star; While revenge and sorrow made him What earth's great ones are;â Long, drear vigils there he kept. Now a sweeter one was lit By the setting sun; While that lady bright was woo'd, While she was won. By the grey cross o'er his brother, By his heart's first care, Did Rienzi ask another In that heart to share. To that maiden's feet he brought All his early youth's affection, All his early years; All whose tender recollection Only speaks in tears. Thus to share his soul he sought: All life's loveliest feelings grew Round that lovely one;â Thus was the bright Nina woo'd, Thus was she won. Ah! the glorious mind's aspiring Needeth some reposeâ Some sweet object for desiring, Where its wings may close. Wrapp'd in purple shadows, Rome Rose afar off like a visionâ Stately, dark, and high; But a softer one had risen Neath that twilight sky. While the full heart found a home, There were mighty words and hopes Shared with his beloved one; Thus was the bright Nina woo'd, Thus was she won. IV. CALYPSO WATCHING THE OCEAN. Years, years have pass'd away, Since to yonder fated bay Did the Hero come. Years, years, have pass'd the while Since he left the lovely isle For his Grecian home. He is with the deadâbut She Weepeth on eternally In the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. Downwards floateth her bright hair, Fairâhow exquisitely fair! But it is unbound. Never since that parting hour Golden band or rosy flower In it has been wound? There it droopeth sadly bright, In the morning's sunny light, On the lone and lovely island In the far off southern seas. Like a marble statue placed, Looking o'er the watery waste, With its white fixed gaze; There the Goddess sits, her eye Raised to the unpitying sky: So uncounted days Has she asked of yonder main, Him it will not bring again To the lone and lovely island In the far off southern seas. To that stately brow is given, Loveliness that sprung from heavenâ Is, like heaven, bright: Never there may time prevail, But her perfect face is pale; And a troubled light Tells of one who may not die, Vex'd with immortality In the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. Desolate beside that strand, Bow'd upon her cold, white hand, Is her radiant head; Silently she sitteth there, While her large eyes on the air Traced the much-loved dead: Eyes that know not tears nor sleep, Would she not be glad to weep, In the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. Far behind the fragrant pile, Sends its odours through the isle; And the winds that stir In the poplars are imbued With the cedar's precious wood, With incense and with myrrh, Till the azure waves beneath Bear away the scented breath Of the lone and lovely island In the far off southern seas. But no more does that perfume Hang around the purple loom Where Calypso wove Threads of gold with curious skill, Singing at her own sweet will Ancient songs of love; Weary on the sea-wash'd shore, She will sing those songs no more In the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. From the large green leaves escape Clusters of the blooming grape; Round the shining throne Still the silver fountains play, Singing on through night and day, But they sing alone: Lovely in their early death, No one binds a violet wreath, In the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. Love and Fateâoh, fearful pair! Terrible in strength ye are; Until ye had been, Happy as a summer night, Conscious of its own sweet light, Was that Island-queen. Would she could forget to grieve, Or that she could die and leave The lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. She is but the type of all, Mortal or celestial, Who allow the heart, In its passion and its power, On some dark and fated hour, To assert its part. Fate attends the steps of Love,â Both brought misery from above To the lone and lovely island Mid the far off southern seas. V. A SUPPER OF MADAME DE BRINVILLIERS. Small but gorgeous was the chamber Where the lady leant; Heliotrope, and musk, and amber, Made an element, Heavy like a storm, but sweet. Softly stole the light uncertain Through the silken fold Of the sweeping purple curtain; And enwrought in gold Was the cushion at her feet. There he knelt to gaze on herâ He the latest worshipper. From the table came the lustre Of its fruit and flowers; There were grapes, each shining cluster Bright with sunny hours,â Noon and night were on their hues. There the purple fig lay hidden Mid its wide green leaves; And the rose, sweet guest, was bidden, While its breath receives Freshness from the unshed dews. Nothing marks the youth of theseâ One bright face is all he sees. With such colours as are dying On a sunset sky; With such odours as are sighing, When the violets die, Are the rich Italian wines. Dark and bright they glow together, In each graceful flask, Telling of the summer weather, And the autumn task, When young maidens stripped the vines. One small flask of cold pale green, Only one, he has not seen. When She woke the heart that slumber'd In a poet's dream, Few the summers he had number'd, Little did he deem Of such passion and such power; When there hangs a life's emotion On a wordâa breathâ Like the storm upon the ocean, Bearing doom and death. Youth has only one such hour; And its shadow now is cast Over him who looks his last. Does he love her?âYes, to madness, Fiery, fierce, and wild; Touch'd, too, with a gentle sadness; For his soul is mild, Tender as his own sad song. And that young wan cheek is wasted With the strife within: Well he knows his course has hasted Through delicious sin, Borne tumultuously along. Never have the stars above Chronicled such utter love. Well the red robe folded round her Suits her stately mien; And the ruby chain has bound her Of some Indian queen;â Pale her cheek is, like a pearl. Heavily the dusky masses Of her night-black hair, Which the raven's wing surpasses, Bind her forehead fair; Odours float from every curl. He would die, so he might wear One soft tress of that long hair. Clear her deep black eyes are shining, Large, and strangely bright; Somewhat of the hid repining, Gives unquiet light To their wild but troubled glow. Dark-fringed lids an eastern languor O'er their depths have shed; But the curved lip knoweth anger, 'Tis so fiercely red,â Passion crimsons in its glow. Tidings from that face depart Of the death within her heart. Does she love the boy who, kneeling, Brings to her his youth, With its passionate, deep feeling, With its hope, its truth? No; his hour has pass'd away! Scarcely does she seek to smother Change and scornful pride; She is thinking of another, With him at her side;â He has had his day! Love has darken'd into hate, And her falsehood is his fate. Even now, her hand extending, Grasps the fated cup; For her red lip o'er it bending, He will drink it up,â He will drink it to her name; Little of the vial knowing That has drugg'd its wave, How its rosy tide is flowing Onwards to the grave! One sweet whisper from her came; And he drank to catch her breath,â Wine and sigh alike are death! VI. THE MOORISH MAIDEN'S VIGIL. Does she watch him, fondly watch him, Does the maiden watch in vain? Do her dark eyes strain to catch him Riding o'er the moonlit plain, Stately, beautiful, and tall? Those long eyelashes are gleaming With the tears she will not shed; Still her patient hope is dreaming That it is his courser's tread, If an olive leaf but fall. Woe for thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's side; Better, than this weary watching, Better thou hadst died. Scarlet is the turban folded Round the long black plaits of hair; And the pliant gold is moulded Round her arms that are as fair As the moonlight which they meet. Little of their former splendour Lingereth in her large dark eyes; Ever sorrow maketh tender, And the heart's deep passion lies In their look so sad and sweet. Woe for thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's side; Better, than this weary watching, Better thou hadst died. Once the buds of the pomegranate Paled beside her cheek's warm dye, Now 'tis like the last sad planet Waning in the morning skyâ She has wept away its red. Can this be the Zegri maiden, Whom Granada named its flower, Drooping like a rose rain-laden?â Heavy must have been the shower, Bowing down its fragrant head. Woe for thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's side; Better, than this weary watching, Better thou hadst died. To the north her fancies wander, There he dwells, her Spanish knight; 'Tis a dreadful thing to ponder, Whether true love heard aright. Did he say those gentle things Over which fond memories linger, And with which she cannot part? Still his ring is on her finger, Still his name is in her heartâ All around his image brings. Woe for thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's side; Better, than this weary watching, Better thou hadst died. Can the fond heart be forsaken By the one who sought that heart? Can there be who will awaken All of life's diviner part, For some vanity's cold reign. Heavy is the lot of womanâ Heavy is her loving lotâ If it thus must share in common Love with those who know it notâ With the careless and the vain. Woe for thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's side; Better, than this weary watching, Better thou hadst died. Faithless Christian!âere the blossom, Hanging on the myrtle bough, Float on the clear fountain's bosom, She who listened to thy vowâ She will watch for thee no more! 'Tis a tale of frequent sorrow Love seems fated to renew; It will be again to-morrow Just as bitter and as true, As it aye has been of yore. Woe to thee, my poor Zorayda, By the fountain's wave; But the shade of rest is round theeâ And it is the grave! VII. THE AWAKENING OF ENDYMION. Lone upon a mountain, the pine-trees wailing round him, Lone upon a mountain the Grecian youth is laid; Sleep, mystic sleep, for many a year has bound him, Yet his beauty, like a statue's pale and fair, is undecay'd. When will he awaken? When will he awaken? a loud voice hath been crying Night after night, and the cry has been in vain; Winds, woods, and waves, found echoes for replying, But the tones of the beloved one were never heard again. When will he awaken? Ask'd the midnight's silver queen. Never mortal eye has looked upon his sleeping; Parents, kindred, comrades, have mourned for him as dead; By day the gathered clouds have had him in their keeping, And at night the solemn shadows round his rest are shed. When will he awaken? Long has been the cry of faithful Love's imploring, Long has Hope been watching with soft eyes fixed above; When will the Fates, the life of life restoring, Own themselves vanquished by much-enduring love? When will he awaken? Asks the midnight's weary queen. Beautiful the sleep that she has watch'd untiring, Lighted up with visions from yonder radiant sky, Full of an immortal's glorious inspiring, Softened by the woman's meek and loving sigh, When will he awaken? He has been dreaming of old heroic stories, The poet's passionate world has entered in his soul; He has grown conscious of life's ancestral glories, When sages and when kings first uphold the mind's control. When will he awaken? Ask'd midnight's stately queen. Lo! the appointed midnight! the present hour is fated; It is Endymion's planet that rises on the air; How long, how tenderly his goddess love has waited, Waited with a love too mighty for despair. Soon he will awaken! Soft amid the pines is a sound as if of singing, Tones that seem the lute's from the breathing flowers depart; Not a wind that wanders o'er Mount Latmos, but is bringing Music that is murmur'd from nature's inmost heart. Soon he will awaken, To his and midnight's queen! Lovely is the green earthâshe knows the hour is holy; Starry are the heavens, lit with eternal joy; Light like their own is dawning sweet and slowly O'er the fair and sculptured forehead of that yet dreaming boy. Soon he will awaken! Red as the red rose towards the morning turning, Warms the youth's lip to the watcher's near his own, While the dark eyes open, bright, intense, and burning With a life more glorious than ere they closed was known. Yes, he has awakened For the midnight's happy queen! What is this old history but a lesson given, How true love still conquers by the deep strength of truth, How all the impulses, whose native home is heaven. Sanctify the visions of hope, faith, and youth. 'Tis for such they waken! When every worldly thought is utterly forsaken, Comes the starry midnight, felt by life's gifted few; Then will the spirit from its earthly sleep awaken To a being more intense, more spiritual and true. So doth the soul awaken, Like that youth to night's fair queen! VIII. THE DEATH OF THE SEA KING. Dark, how dark the morning That kindles the sky! But darker the scorning Of Earl Harold's eye; On his deck he is lying,â It once was his throne, Yet there he is dying, Unheeded and lone. There gather'd round nor follower nor foeman, But over him bendeth a young and pale woman. He has lived mid the hurtle Of spears and of snow; Yet green droops the myrtle Where he is laid low: The vessel is stranded On some southern isle; The foes that are banded Will wait her awhile:â Ay, long is that waitingâfor never again Will the Sea Raven sweep o'er her own northern main. He was born on the water, Mid storm and 'mid strife; Through tempest and slaughter Was hurried his life; Few years has he numbered, And golden his head, Yet the north hills are cumbered With bones of his dead. The combat is distant, the whirlwind is past From the spot where Earl Harold is breathing his last. 'Tis an isle which the ocean Has kept like a bride, For the moonlit devotion Of each gentler tide; No eyes hath ere wander'd, No step been addrest, Where nature has squander'd Her fairest and best. Yet the wild winds have brought from the Baltic afar That vessel of slaughter, that lord of the war. He saw his chiefs stooping, But not unto him; The stately form drooping, The flashing eye dim. The wind from the nor'erd Swept past, fierce and free; It hurried them forward, They knew not the sea; And a foe track'd their footsteps more stern than the tideâ The plague was among themâthey sicken'd and died. Left last, and left lonely, Earl Harold remain'd; One captiveâone only Life's burden sustain'd; She watch'd o'er his sleeping, Low, sweetly she spoke, He saw not her weeping, She smiled when he woke; Tho' stern was his bearing and haughty his tone, He had one gentler feeling, and that was her own. Fierce the wild winds were blowing That drove them all night, Now the hush'd waves are flowing In music and light: The storm is forsaking Its strife with the main, And the blue sky is breaking Thro' clouds and thro' rain: They can see the fair island whereon they are thrown, Where the palms and the spice-groves rise lovely and lone. Her bright hair is flying Escaped from its fold, The night-dews are drying Away from its gold; The op'ning flowers quiver Beneath the soft air; She turns with a shiver From what is so fair. Paler, colder the forehead that rests on her knee! For her, in the wide world, what is there to see! He triesâvain the tryingâ To lift up his sword, As if still defying The Death, now his lord. Once to gaze on the ocean, His lips faintly stir; But life's last emotion Is one look on her. Down drops on his bosom her beautiful head,â The Earl and the maiden together lie dead! IX. THE LITTLE GLEANER. Very fair the child was, with hair of darkest auburn,â Fair, and yet sunburnt with the golden summer: Sunshine seem'd the element from which she drew her being. Careless from her little hand the gather'd ears are scatter'd, In a graceful wreath the purple corn-flowers binding; While her sweet face brightens with a sudden pleasure. Blame not her binding: already stirs within her All the deep emotions in the love of nature,â Love, that is the source of the beautiful and holy. In long-after years will memory, recalling Sweetness undying from that early garland, Keep the heart glad with natural devotion. 'Tis a true, sweet lesson; for, in life's actual harvest, Much we need the flowers that mingle with our labours. Pleasures, pure and simple, recall us to their Giver; For ever, in its joy, does the full heart think of Heaven. X. THE CARRIER-PIGEON RETURNED. Sunset has flung its glory o'er the floods, That wind amid Ionia's myrtle woods,â Sunset that dies a conqueror in his splendour; But the warm crimson ray Has almost sunk away Beneath a purple twilight faint and tender. Soft are the hues around the marble fanes, Whose marble shines amid the wooded plains,â Fanes where a false but lovely creed was kneeling,â A creed that held divine All that was but a sign, The outward to the inward world appealing. Earth was a child, and child-like, in those hours, Full of fresh feelings, and scarce conscious powers, Around its own impatient beauty flinging; These young believings were Types of the true and fair,â The holy faith that Time was calmly bringing. Still to those woods, with ruins fill'd, belong The ancient immortality of song,â Names and old words whose music is undying,â Yet do they haunt the heart With its divinest part, The past that to the present is replying. The purple ocean far beneath her feet, The wild thyme on the fragrant hill her seat, As in the days of old there leans a Maiden,â Many have watch'd before The breaking waves ashore,â Faint with uncounted moments sorrow-laden. With cold and trembling hand She has undone the band Around the carrier-pigeon just alighted,â And instant dies away The transitory ray From the dark eye it had one instant lighted. The sickness of a hope too long deferred Sinks on her heart,âit is no longer stirred By the quick presence of the sweet emotion,â Sweet even unto pain, With which she sees again Her bird come sweeping o'er the purple ocean. Woe for the watcher,âstill it doth not bring A letter nestled fragrant 'neath its wing; There is no answer to her fond inquiring,â Again, and yet again, No letter o'er the main Quiets the anxious spirit's fond desiring. Down the ungather'd darkness of her hair Floats, like a pall that covers her despair,â What woman's care hath she in her adorning? The noontide's sultry hours Have wither'd the white flowers, Binding its dark lengths in the early morning. All day her seat hath been beside the shore Watching for him who will return no more; He thinks not of her or her weary weeping. Absence, it is thy lot To be too soon forgot, Or to leave memory but to one sad keeping. Oh, folly of a loving heart that clings With desperate faith, to which each moment brings Quick and faint gleams an instant's thought must smother; And yet finds mocking scope For some unreal hope, Which would appear despair to any other! She knows the hopelessness of what she seeks, And yet, as soon as rosy morning breaks, Doth she unloose her pigeon's silken fetter; But thro' the twilight air No more its pinions bear What once so oft they broughtâthe false one's letter. The harvest of the summer-rose is spread, But lip and cheek with her have lost their red; Theirs is the paleness of the soul's consumingâ Fretfully day by day In sorrow worn away; Youth, joy, and bloom have no more sure entombing. It is a common story, which the air Has had around the weary world to bear, That of the trusting spirit's vain accusing; Yet once how firm and fond Seemed the eternal bond That now a few brief parted days are loosing. Close to her heart the weary pigeon lies, Gazing upon her with its earnest eyes, Which seem to askâWhy are we thus neglected? It is the still despair Of passion forced to bear Its deep and tender offering rejected. Poor girl! her soul is heavy with the past; Around the shades of night are falling fast; Heavier still the shadow passing o'er her. The maiden will no more Watch on the sea-beat shoreâ The darkness of the grave is now before her. XI. ALEXANDER ON THE BANKS OF THE HYPHASIS. Lonely by the moonlit waters Does the conqueror stand, Yet unredden'd by the slaughters Of his mighty band. Yet his laurel wants a leaf. There he stands, sad, silent, lonely; For his hope is vain: He has reached that river only To return again. Mournful bends the matchless chief; Heâthe earth's unrivalled oneâ He must leave his task undone. Far behind the camp lies sleepingâ Gods! how can they sleep, Pale fear o'er their slumbers creeping, With a world to weep? With a victory to win. There they lie in craven slumber, By their murmurs wonâ Must their earthly weakness cumber Jove's immortal son? From the ardent fire within, Is there no impelling ray To excite their on ward way? No! beside that moonlit river Stands the soldier-king, While he hears the night-wind shiver With a weary wingâ With a weary sound to him; By the numerous shadows broken On the river's brimâ From the mirror'd stars a token That his star is dimâ Changed and sullen they appear. To a great and fix'd despair All things fate and omen are. Far away the plains are spreading Various, dark and vastâ Where a thousand tombs are shading Memories from the pastâ He must leave them still unknown. All the world's ancestral learningâ Secrets strange and oldâ Early wisdom's dark discerning, Must remain untold. Mighty is the hope o'erthrownâ Mighty was the enterprise Which upon that moment dies. With the moonlight on them sleeping Stands each stately palm, Like to ancient warriors keeping Vigil stern and calm O'er a prostrate world below. Sudden from beneath their shadow Forth a serpent springs, O'er the sands, as o'er a meadow, Winding in dark rings. Stately doth it glide, and slow Like an omen in a dream, Does that giant serpent seem. Silvery rose those far sands shining, Where that shade was castâ While the king with stern repining Watched the serpent past. Sadly did the conqueror sayâ âWould my steps were like my spirit, I would track thy path! What those distant sands inherit, What this new world hath, Should grow bright around my way. Ah! not mine, yon glorious sphereâ My world's boundary is here!â Pale he stood, the moonlight gleaming In his golden hairâ Somewhat of a spirit's seeming, Glorious and fair, Is upon that radiant brow. Like the stars that kindle heaven In the sacred night, To those blue clear eyes were given An unearthly light, Though the large tears fill them now; For the Macedonian wept As his midnight watch he kept. In those mighty tears' o'erflowing, Found the full heart scope For the bitter overthrowing Of its noblest hope; So will many weep again. Our aspirings have arisen In another world; Life is but the spirit's prison, Where its wings are furl'd, Stretching to their flight in vain,â Seeking that eternal home Which is in a world to come. Like earth's proudest conqueror, turning From his proudest field, Is the human soul still yearning For what it must yield, Of dreams unfulfill'd and powers; Like the great yet guided ocean Is our mortal mind, Stirr'd by many a high emotion, But subdued, confined;â Such are shadows of the hours, Glorious in the far-off gloom, But whose altar is the tomb! [There is something singularly fine in Alexander's appeal to his army, when the Indian world lay before them, but more present to their fears than to their hopes. âFor my own part,â said the ardent conqueror, âI recognise no limits to the lahours of a high-spirited man but the failure of adequate objects.â Never was more noble motto for all human achievement; and it was from a lofty purpose that the Macedonians turned back on the banks of the Hyphasis. But it is the same with all mortal enterprise: nothing is, in this world, carried out to its complete fulfilment. Our mortality predominates in a world only meant to be a passage to another.] XII. THE ZEGRI LADY'S VIGIL. Ever sits the lady weepingâ Weeping night and dayâ One perpetual vigil keeping, Till life pass away, And she join the seven who sleep. Daylight enters not that building, Tho' so rich and fairâ With the azure and the gilding That are lavish'd there; Round the purple curtains sweep, Heavily their shadows creep Around the Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. On the walls are many a sentence, In bright letters wroughtâ Touch'd not with the meek repentance By the Gospel broughtâ But the Koran's haughty wordsâ Words that, like a trumpet calling, Urge the warrior on; In the front of battle falling, Paradise is wonâ By the red and ready swordsâ Can they soothe the spirit's chords Of the lonely Zegri Ladyeâ Of the Ladye weeping there! Seven tombs are in that chamberâ Each a marble tomb:â Lamps that breathe of musk and amber Tremble in the gloom. Seven lamps perfume the air. On each tomb a statue lying, Almost seems like life; And, above, the banner flying Seems to dare the strifeâ Which again it may not dare. Can the carved statues there Suffice the Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there! While the others fled around them, Did the seven die.â In the front of war she found them With none others nigh:â Noble was the blood they shed. Sacred in her grief and beauty, Did the Ladye go, Asking life's last sacred duty Of the Christian foe. Those white feet were stain'd with red, When the King bestow'd her dead On the lovely Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. Never since the hour she brought them To that ancient hall, Since with her sad hands she wrought them Their embroidered pall, Hath the daylight seen her face. Rosy o'er the Guadalquivir Doth the morning gleam; Pale the silver moonbeams shiver O'er the haunted stream. Nothing knows she of their graceâ Nothing cheers the funeral place Of the lonely Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. Each of six tombs hold a brotherâ All her house's pride:â Six contain her line; one other Riseth at her side. Who is in that seventh tomb? One far dearer than the others Shares their place of rest: Well she loved her noble brothersâ But she loved him bestâ He who shared the warrior's doom With the favour at his plume Of the lovely Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. Never more when first appearing Will he watch her eye, In the mounted lists careering, When his steed went by Rapid as the lance he flung. Never more when night is lonely Will the warrior glide To the citron shade, where only He was at her side, While the very wild wind hung On the music of the tongue Of the lovely Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. Not with daylight to discover How the wretched weep Will the maiden wail her lover, Or her brothers keep In remembrance with her tears. Grief hath stern and silent powers, And her house is proud; Not to day's cold guarded hours Is despair allow'd; But, shut out with haughty fears, Pride with daylight disappears, From the lovely Zegri Ladyeâ The Ladye weeping there. But her slight frame has been shaken By the sudden blight, And her dark eyes are forsaken By their former light; Heavy is their settled gloom. And her wan cheek beareth token Of young life's decline; You may see the heart is broken By each outward sign. Soon the heart can life consume, Fast approaching is the tomb Of the lonely Zegri Ladyeâ Of the Ladye weeping there. ARIADNE WATCHING THE SEA AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THESEUS. Lonelyâlonely on the shoreâ Where the mighty waters roar, Would that she could pass them o'er! Doth the maiden stand. Those small ivory feet are bare, Rosy as the small shells are, They are, than the feet, less fair On that sea-beat strand! Wherefore doth the girl complain? Wind and wave will hear in vain. Dark as is the raven's breast Wand'ring wild in its unrestâ Like a human thought in quest Of a future hour, Do her raven tresses flow Over neck and arm below, White as is the silent snow, Or the early flower! Coming ere the summer sun Colours what it shines upon. Vainly does the west wind seek To recall upon her cheek How the red rose used to break In her native isleâ Breaking with a lovely flush; But her cheek has lost its blush And her lip its smile: Once how fair they used to spring For the young Athenian King! Desolateâhow desolateâ Does the Cretan lady wait On the beach forlorn, who late In a palace dwelt. They will notâthe coming wavesâ Watch her pleasure like the slaves Who before her knelt; And the least sign was command From her slight but royal hand. Lovely was the native bower Where she dwelt a guarded flower, In her other happier hour, Ere love grew to pain. Mid these grey rocks may she roam, For the maiden hath no homeâ None will have again. Never more her eyes will meet Welcome from her native Crete. Little did that Princess fear, When a thousand swords were near, Where no other was her peer, That an hour was nigh, When her hands would stretch in vain Helpless to the unpitying main, To the unpitying skyâ Earth below and heaven above Witness to the wrongs of Love. On the white and sounding surge, In the dark horizon's verge, Does a vessel seem to urge Fast her onward way. And the swelling canvass spread, Glitters in the early red Of the coming day; 'Tis as if that vessel bore All the sunshine from the shore. Hath the young King left her sideâ She but yesterday his brideâ Who for his sake cross'd the tide, Gave him love and life? He hath left her far behind To the warring wave and wind. But what is their strife, To the war within the heart, Which beholdeth him depart? She hath perill'd life and fame Upon an all desperate game; What availeth now her claim On the false and fled? Not him only hath she lostâ All the spirit treasured most Has its lustre shed. Let the false one cross the main, If she could believe again. After hours may yet restore To the cheek the rose it wore, And, as it has smiled before, So the lip will smile. Let them be however bright, Never will they wear the light Of their native isle. Trusting, happy were they thenâ Such they cannot be again. Strange the heart's emotions are, How from out of its despair Will it summon strength to hear Desperate wrong and woe! But such strength is as the light Seen upon the grave by nightâ There is death below: And the very gleam that flashes Kindles from the heart's sweet ashes. Maiden! gazing o'er the sea, Wistfully, how wistfully!â Thine such weary doom must beâ Thine the weary heart. Woe for confidence misplaced, For affections run to waste, And for hopes that partâ Leaving us their farewell word, One for ever jarring chord. There the Cretan maiden stands, Wringing her despairing hands, Lonely on the lonely sandsâ 'Tis a woman's lot: Only let her heart be won, And her summer hour is doneâ Soon she is forgot; Sad she strays by life's bleak shore, Loving, but beloved no more! XIV. THE TWO DEATHS. I. The Death of Sigurd, the Earl of Northumberland. The Earl lay on his purple bed, Faint and heavy was his head, Where the snows of age were shedâ Heavy on his pillow. Never more when seas are dark Will Earl Sigurd guide his bark Thro' the dashing billow. Never from that bed of pain Will the warrior rise again. Yes, he will arise:âe'en now Red he flushes to the brow; Like the light before his prow Is the dark eye's gleaming. No: it never shall be said Sigurd died within his bed With its curtains streamingâ Whose sole curtain wont to be Banners red with victory. Lift me up, the sea-king saidâ At the word his sons obey'd, And the old man was convey'd Where the sea was sounding, At his ancient castle-gate, Death's dark coming to await, With his knights surrounding. Morn was reddening in the sky, As the Earl came forth to die. In a carved oaken chair, Carved with carving quaint and rareâ Faces strange and garlands fairâ Is the chieftain seated, As when at some festival In his high ancestral hall Bards his deeds repeated. And there was no loftier song, Than what bore his name along. Round him swept his mantle red, Like a chief apparelled, With his helmet on his headâ With its white plumes flying. At his side the sheathed brand, And the spear in his right handâ Mid the dead and dying. Where the battle raged the worst, Ever was that right hand first. Heâthe tamer of the wildâ Who invincible was styled, Now is feeble as a child By its mother sleeping; But the mind is unsubduedâ Fearless is the warrior's mood, While his eyes are keeping This last vigil strange and lone, That his spirit may be known. As a ship cuts through the froth Shining comes the morning forth, From his own ancestral north, While each rosy vapour Kindles beautiful and bright, With an evanescent light: But the human taper Hath an even briefer ray: Strange, oh life, is thy decay! Haughtily his castle stands On a rock amid the sands, Where the waves in gather'd bands Day by day are dashing. Never is the sounding shore Still with their eternal roar, And their strife is flashing To the noontide's azure ight, And the stars that watch at night. Sigurd's look is on the foam Where his childhood wont to roamâ For the sea has been his home From his earliest hoursâ Gathering the echoing shells, Where the future tempest dwells, As some gather flowers; Trembling when a rosy boy With a fierce and eager joy. Many things long since forgot In a hard and hurried lot Now ariseâthey trouble not Him, the stately hearted: But he saw a blue-eyed maid, Long since 'mid the long grass laid, And true friends departed. Tears that stand in that dark eye Only may the sea-breeze dry. Longer do the shadows fall Of his castle's armed wall, Yet the old man sits, while all Stand behind him weeping: But behind they stand, for he Would not brook man's tears to see. One fair child is sleepingâ To his grandsire's feet he crept, Weeping silent till he slept. Heavily beneath his mail Seems Earl Sigurd's breath to fail, And his pale cheek is more pale, And his hand less steady. Crimson are the sky and surge, Stars are on th' horizon's verge, Night and Death are ready! Down in ocean goes the sun, And Earl Sigurd's life is done! II. The Death of Camoens. Pale comes the moonlight thro' the lattice gleaming, Narrow is the lattice, scanty is the ray, Yet on its white wings the fragrant dews are streamingâ Dewsâoh how sweet after August's sultry day! Narrow is the latticeâoh let night's darkness cover Chamber so wretched from any careless eyeâ Over yon pallet whatever shadows hover, They are less dark than the shadow drawing nighâ Death, it is thy shadow! Let the weary one now die! Beautiful, how beautiful!âthe heavy eyes now closing Only with the weight of the moonlight's soothing smileâ Or do they recall another hour's reposing, When the myrtle and the moonlight were comrades the while? Yes; for, while memory languidly is fetching Her treasures from the depths which they have lain among, A fragile handâhow thinâhow weakâis sadly sketching Figures and fancies that cell's white walls along. On the lip there is a murmurâ It is the swan's last song. Dark order of St. Dominick! thy shelter to the weary Is like thy ruleâcold, stern, unpitying in its aid; Cold is general charity, lorn the cell and drearyâ Yet there the wayâworn wretched one may rest the dying head; Who would remember himâah, who does remember!â He the ill-fated, yet the young and gifted one? Grief and toil have quench'd life's once aspiring ember: High heaven may have pityâbut man for man has none! Close thine eyes, Camoens; Life's task is nearly done. Feebly his hand upon the wall is tracing One lovely face and one face alone, E'en the coming hourâother memories effacingâ Leaves that as fresh as when it first was known; Faintly he traces with white and wasted fingers What was once so lovelyâwhat is still so dear: Life's latest look, like its earliest one, yet lingers On the large soft eyes that seem to meet him here; Love's ethereal vision Is not of Earth's dim sphere! Large, soft, and dark, the eyes, where he has blended So much of the soul, are somewhat like his own; So in their youth the auburn hair descended, Such the sad sweet smile to either red lip known. Like were they in beauty, so the heart's light trembled On the flushing cheek and in the kindling eye; Yet more clearly likeâthe inward world resembledâ In its sweet communionâthe tender and the high; Our cold world is cruel To rend so sweet a tie. Thro' a weary world-path known to care and sorrow, Still was her influence o'er his being cast; She was the hope that whispered of to-morrow, She was the memoried music of the pastâ She was in his numbersâwhen those numbers breathing Of his country's glory made it glorious moreâ To its southern language long harmony bequeathing, Haunting every wild wave dashing on its shore. Ay, the poet's music Is lovely as of yore. Dream not that the love which haunts the poet's spirit Is the common passion that sweetens daily earth: From a world ethereal its nature must inherit All the high imaginings that crowded round its birth; From the pure, pale stars, amid their midnight watches, It asks for inspiration lofty and divine; From the small wild flowers amid the woods it catches Charms, round the careless and the usual path to shine. Such is the poet's passionâ Such, Camoens, was thine. Flinging far below him each meaner thought that cumbers Wishes born of wants, he lighted up life's dream With the kindling light that warms the poet's numbersâ Yet are they sung by the Tajo's sunny stream. Still was his country the theme of his inspiring, How her bold vessels first swept the southern seasâ Still was her praise the meed of his desiring, While telling how her heroes met the fierce and mighty breeze. The past and its sea-triumphsâ His dreams were fill'd with these. How was he rewarded?âhow are such rewarded? Those who thus lavish their inward wealth in vain? Only one doom for the poet is recordedâ A present that must buy the future with its pain. Long, long away, toss'd on the Indian billow, Dream'd he sweet songs for his lady and his land; Pale and wan he lies on his last neglected pillowâ None are near to minister with soft and soothing hand. There let the poet perishâ So hath perish'd all his band. Heavily, heavily his large black eyes are closing On the twilight loveliness they are too faint to know; O'er that pale high forehead a shadow is reposingâ Peace to the weary heart that languid beats below! From that sweet lip its old songs are departed; Take, ye wild winds, what it wont to breathe of yoreâ There he is dying deserted, broken-hearted, Like a broken lute which no music wanders o'er. Farewell to Cameons! The swan will sing no more. Yet not for this in the spirit's faith I falter, Heavy though the doom beâyet glorious is the meed. Let the life be laid upon the fated altarâ It is but the sacrifice of an eternal creed. Never yet was song breathed in this high believing, But, like a star, it hath floated down time's wave! While what lofty praises and what tender grieving And what noble hopes, come to sanctify and save! Even such the glory, Camoens, by thy grave THE DREAM IN THE TEMPLE OF SERAPIS. âDuring Alexander the Great's illness, Peithou, Attalus, Demophon, Peucestas, Cleomenes, Minedas, and Seleucus, slept in the Temple of Serapis, and asked the god if it would be desirable and better for Alexander to be conveyed to the temple, and to supplicate the god, and be healed by him. The answer forbade his removal, declaring that it would be better for him to remain where he was. The companions reported this answer, and Alexander not long after expired, as if, under all circumstances, that were the better fate.ââRoyal Diary. The heavy night is falling, A dark and silent night, And aloud the storm is calling From the mountains' wooded height, There is weeping in the pines. But a voice of louder sorrow Arises from the plain, For the nations fear the morrow, And ask for aid in vain, From the old ancestral shrines In the still and stately templeâ The temple of the god. The kingly chiefs are seven Who seek that ancient shrine, To ask of night and heaven An answer and a sign; Pale as shadows pass they by. They are warriors, yet they falter, As with feet unshod They approach thy mighty altar, O Assyrian god! Will the secret of the sky Fill the stately templeâ The temple of the god? Conquerors they enter, In the conqueror's name; The altar in the centre, Burnt with undying flameâ Day and night that flame is fed. Lamps from many a marble column In the distance burn, And the light is sad and solemn As a funeral urn. For the presence of the dead Haunts the mystic templeâ The temple of the god. Seven warriors were their number, Seven future kings; Down they laid them to their slumber Mid the silvery rings Of the fragrant smoke that swept From the golden vases streaming, With their spice and oil, And the rich frankincense steaming, Half a summer's spoil. Lull'd by such perfume they slept In the silent templeâ The temple of the god. Lay they in that sleep enchanted, On the marble floor; Many things their slumber haunted, Things that were no more. 'Twas the phantasm of life: Fierce and rugged bands were crowding Round their youthful king; Shaggy hides their wild forms shrouding, While the echoes ring With the shouts that herald strife; Such now wake the quiet templeâ The temple of the god. Next, a southern noon is sleeping On embattled lines; There the purple robe is sweeping, There the red gold shines. That young chief his own has wonâ He who, when his warriors tasked him, With his heart's free scope, What was left himself, they ask'd him, And he answer'd, âHope.â What he said, that hath he done; And his glory fills the templeâ The temple of the god. Victory is like sunshine o'er him, Wealth is at his side, Crowns are in the dust before him, Earth hath bow'd her pride At the whisper of his breath. But that laurell'd one is dying On a fever'd bed: âLeave him where he now is lying, There the king is best,â it said; Such the oracle of death, In that fated templeâ The temple of the god. Such the moral of his story, Such was heaven's reply; Amid wealth, and power, and glory, It is best to die! Unto all that answer came. From the highest to the lowest Life draws deep a wasted breath: Fate! thy best boon thou bestowest When thou givest death. Each that oracle may claim, The words of that dark templeâ The temple of the god. DEATH-BED OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT. On his bed the king was lyingâ On his purple bed; âWhile Alexander was on his death-bed, the soldiers,â says Arrian, âbecame eager to see him; some to see him once more alive, others because it was reported that he was already dead, and a suspicion had arisen that his death was concealed by the chief officers of the guards, but the majority from sorrow and anxiety for their king; they, therefore, forced their way into his chamber, and the whole army passed in procession by the bed where he lay pale and speechless.â âTell us not that he is dying;â So his soldiers said, âHe is yet too young to die. Have ye drugged the cup ye gave him, Plutarch mentions that one of the popular reports was, that Alexander's death was occasioned by poison administered by Iollas, his cup-bearer. This poison, the water of a mountain-spring, was of so corrossive a nature as to destroy every substance but the mule's hoof in which it was brought. From the fatal spring? Is it yet too late to save him? We will see our king! Let his faithful ones draw nigh, The silver-shielded warriorsâ The warriors of the world!â Back they fling the fragrant portals Of the royal tent; Phylarchus gives a splendid account of Alexander's magnificence. His tent contained a hundred couches, and was supported by eight columns of solid gold. Overhead was stretched cloth of gold, wrought with various devices, and expanded so as to cover the whole ceiling. Within, in a semicircle, stood five hundred Persians, bearing lances adorned with pomegranates; their dress was purple and orange. Next to these were drawn up a thousand archers, partly clothed in flame-coloured, and partly in scarlet dresses. Many of these wore azure-coloured scarfs. In front of these were arranged five hundred Macedonian Argyraspides, soldiers, so called from their silver shields. In the middle was the golden throne, on which Alexander sat and gave audience. The tent on the outside was encircled by elephauts drawn up in order, and by a thousand Macedonians in their native dress. Beyond these were the Persian guard often thousand men, and the five hundred courtiers allowed to wear purple robes. Vainly to the stern immortals Sacrifice and vow were sent. Alexander's death was preceded by many omens, which sacrifice vainly strove to avert. Cold and pitiless are they! Silent in their starry dwelling, Nothing do they heed Of the tale that earth is telling, In her hour of need! They have turned their face away, Ye silver shielded warriors, Ye warriors of the world! In that royal tent is weeping; Women's tears will flow; There the queens their watch are keeping After the conqueror's death, Roxana allured her gentler rival into her power, and poisoned her. She was the beautiful daughter of a barbarian chief, made captive by Alexander, who was so struck with her charms, that he immediately married her. Statira was the child of Darius, and inherited the evil fortunes of her ill-fated race. With a separate woe. One still wears her diademâ One her long fair hair is rending, From its pearls unbound; Pearls were favourite ornaments with the Persian ladies, who often wore them wreathed in their hair. Tears from those soft eyes descending, Eyes that seek the ground. But Roxana looks on them, The silver-shielded warriors, The warriors of the world! In the east the day was reddening, When the warriors pass'd; In the west the night was deadening, As they looked their last; As they looked their last on himâ He, their comradeâtheir commanderâ He, the earth's adoredâ He, the godlike Alexander! Who can wield his sword? As they went their eyes were dim, The silver-shielded warriors, The warriors of the world! Slowly passed the sad procession By the purple bed; Every soldier in succession Thro' that tent was led. All beheld their monarch's faceâ Pale and beautifulâreclining, There the conqueror lay, From his radiant eyes the shining Had not passed away. There he watched them from his placeâ His silver-shielded warriors, His warriors of the world! Still he was a king in seeming, For he wore his crown; And his sunny hair was streaming His white forehead down. Glorious was that failing head! Still his golden baldric bound him, Where his sword was hung: Bright his arms were scattered round him, And his glance still clung To the warriors by his bedâ The silver-shielded warriors, The warriors of the world! Pale and motionless he rested, Like a statue white and cold, With his royal state invested; For the purple and the gold In his latest hour he wore. But the eye and breath are failing, And the mighty Soul has fled! The death of Alexander plunged all his vast empire into anarchy and slaughter. He was the soul that animated the mighty force that afterwards wasted its energies in petty warfare. The popular saying attributed to him might well be true, âThat the survivors would celebrate his obsequies with bloody funeral games.â Lift ye up the loud bewailing, For a wide world mourns the Dead; And they have a Chief no moreâ The silver-shielded warriors, The warriors of the world! STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF MRS. HEMANS. âThe roseâthe glorious rose is gone.ââLays of Many Lands. Bring flowers to crown the cup and lute,â Bring flowers,âthe bride is near; Bring flowers to soothe the captive's cell, Bring flowers to strew the bier! Bring flowers! thus said the lovely song; And shall they not be brought To her who linked the offering With feeling and with thought? Bring flowers,âthe perfumed and the pure,â Those with the morning dew, A sigh in every fragrant leaf, A tear on every hue. So pure, so sweet thy life has been, So filling earth and air With odours and with loveliness, Till common scenes grew fair. Thy song around our daily path Flung beauty born of dreams, And scattered o'er the actual world The spirit's sunny gleams. Mysterious influence, that to earth Brings down the heaven above, And fills the universal heart With universal love. Such gifts were thine,âas from the block, The unformed and the cold, The sculptor calls to breathing life Some shape of perfect mould, So thou from common thoughts and things Didst call a charmed song, Which on a sweet and swelling tide Bore the full soul along. And thou from far and foreign lands Didst bring back many a tone, And giving such new music still, A music of thine own. A lofty strain of generous thoughts, And yet subdued and sweet,â An angel's song, who sings of earth, Whose cares are at his feet. And yet thy song is sorrowful, Its beauty is not bloom; The hopes of which it breathes, are hopes That look beyond the tomb. Thy song is sorrowful as winds That wander o'er the plain, And ask for summer's vanish'd flowers, And ask for them in vain. Ah! dearly purchased is the gift, The gift of song like thine; A fated doom is her's who stands The priestess of the shrine. The crowdâthey only see the crown, They only hear the hymn;â They mark not that the cheek is pale, And that the eye is dim. Wound to a pitch too exquisite, The soul's fine chords are wrung; With misery and melody They are too highly strung. The heart is made too sensitive Life's daily pain to bear; It beats in music, but it beats Beneath a deep despair. It never meets the love it paints, The love for which it pines; Too much of Heaven is in the faith That such a heart enshrines. The meteor-wreath the poet wears Must make a lonely lot; It dazzles, only to divide From those who wear it not. Didst thou not tremble at thy fame, And loathe its bitter prize, While what to others triumph seemed, To thee was sacrifice? Oh, Flower brought from Paradise To this cold world of ours, Shadows of beauty such as thine Recall thy native bowers. Let others thank theeâ'twas for them Thy soft leaves thou didst wreathe; The red rose wastes itself in sighs Whose sweetness others breathe! And they have thanked theeâmany a lip Has asked of thine for words, When thoughts, life's finer thoughts, have touched The spirit's inmost chords. How many loved and honoured thee Who only knew thy name; Which o'er the weary working world Like starry music came! With what still hours of calm delight Thy songs and image blend; I cannot choose but think thou wert An old familiar friend. The charm that dwelt in songs of thine My inmost spirit moved; And yet I feel as thou hadst been Not half enough beloved. They say that thou wert faint, and worn With suffering and with care; What music must have filled the soul That had so much to spare! Oh, weary One! since thou art laid Within thy mother's breastâ The green, the quiet mother-earthâ Thrice blessed be thy rest! Thy heart is left within our hearts, Although life's pang is o'er; But the quick tears are in my eyes, And I can write no more. THREE EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF A WEEK. A record of the inward world, whose facts Are thoughtsâand feelingsâfears, and hopes, and dreams. There are some days that might outmeasure yearsâ Days that obliterate the past, and make The future of the colour which they cast. A day may be a destiny; for life Lives in but littleâbut that little teems With some one chance, the balance of all time: A lookâa wordâand we are wholly changed. We marvel at ourselvesâwe would deny That which is working in the hidden soul; But the heart knows and trembles at the truth: On such these records linger. We might have been! We might have been!âthese are but common words, And yet they make the sum of life's bewailing; They are the echo of those finer chords, Whose music life deplores when unavailing. We might have been! We might have been so happy! says the child, Pent in the weary school-room during summer, When the green rushes 'mid the marshes wild, And rosy fruits, attend the radiant comer. We might have been! It is the thought that darkens on our youth, When first experienceâsad experienceâteaches What fallacies we have believed for truth, And what few truths endeavour ever reaches. We might have been! Alas! how different from what we are Had we but known the bitter path before us; But feelings, hopes, and fancies left afar, What in the wide bleak world can e'er restore us? We might have been! It is the motto of all human things, The end of all that waits on mortal seeking; The weary weight upon Hope's flagging wings, It is the cry of the worn heart while breaking. We might have been! And when, warm with the heaven that gave it birth, Dawns on our world-worn way Love's hour Elysian, The last fair angel lingering on our earth, The shadow of what thought obscures the vision? We might have been! A cold fatality attends on love, Too soon or else too late the heart-beat quickens; The star which is our fate springs up above, And we but sayâwhile round the vapour thickensâ We might have been! Life knoweth no like misery; the rest Are single sorrows,âbut in this are blended All sweet emotions that disturb the breast; The light that was our loveliest is ended. We might have been! Henceforth, how much of the full heart must be A sealÃ¨d book at whose contents we tremble? A still voice mutters 'mid our misery, The worst to hear, because it must dissembleâ We might have been! Life is made up of miserable hours, And all of which we craved a brief possessing, For which we wasted wishes, hopes, and powers, Comes with some fatal drawback on the blessing. We might have been! The future never renders to the past The young beliefs intrusted to its keeping; Inscribe one sentenceâlife's first truth and lastâ On the pale marble where our dust is sleepingâ We might have been. Necessity. In the ancestral presence of the dead Sits a lone powerâa veil upon the head, Stern with the terror of an unseen dread. It sitteth cold, immutable, and still, Girt with eternal consciousness of ill, And strong and silent as its own dark will. We are the victims of its iron rule, The warm and beating human heart its tool; And man, immortal, godlike, but its fool. We know not of its presence, though its power Be on the gradual round of every hour, Now flinging down an empire, now a flower. And all things small and careless are its own, Unwittingly the seed minute is sown,â The tree of evil out of it is grown. At times we see and struggle with our chain, And dream that somewhat we are freed, in vain; The mighty fetters close on us again. We mock our actual strength with lofty thought, And towers that look into the heavens are wrought,â But after all our toil the task is nought. Down comes the stately fabric, and the sands Are scatter'd with the work of myriad hands, High o'er whose pride the fragile wild-flower stands. Such are the wrecks of nations and of kings, Far in the desert, where the palm-tree springs; 'Tis the same story in all meaner things. The heart builds up its hopes, though not addrest To meet the sunset glories of the west, But garnered in some still, sweet-singing nest. But the dark power is on its noiseless way, The song is silent so sweet yesterday, And not a green leaf lingers on the spray. We mock ourselves with freedom, and with hope, The while our feet glide down life's faithless slope; One has no strength, the other has no scope. So we are flung on Time's tumultuous wave, Forced there to struggle, but denied to save, Till the stern tide ebbsâand there is the grave. Memory. I do not say bequeath unto my soul Thy memory,âI rather ask forgetting; Withdraw, I pray, from me thy strong control, Leave something in the wide world worth regretting. I need my thoughts for other things than thee, I dare not let thine image fill them only; The hurried happiness it wakes in me Will leave the hours that are to come more lonely. I live not like the many of my kind; Mine is a world of feelings and of fancies, Fancies whose rainbow-empire is the mind, Feelings that realize their own romances. To dream and to create has been my fate, Alone, apart from life's more busy scheming; I fear to think that I may find too late Vain was the toil, and idle was the dreaming. Have I uprear'd my glorious pyre of thought, Up to the heavens, but for my own entombing? The fair and fragrant things that years have brought Must they be gathered for my own consuming? Oh! give me back the past that took no part In the existence it was but surveying; That knew not then of the awaken'd heart Amid the life of other lives decaying. Why should such be mine own? I sought it not: More than content to live apart and lonely, The feverish tumult of a loving lot, Is what I wish'd, and thought to picture only. Surely the spirit is its own free will; What should o'ermaster mine to vain complying With hopes that call down what they bring of ill, With fears to their own questioning replying? In vain, in vain! Fate is above us all; We struggle, but what matters our endeavour? Our doom is gone beyond our own recall, May we deny or mitigate it?ânever! And what art thou to me,âthou who dost wake The mind's still depths with trouble and repining? Nothing;âthough all things now thy likeness take; Nothing,âand life has nothing worth resigning. Ah, yes! one thing, thy memory; though grief Watching the expiring beam of hope's last ember; Life had one hour,âbright, beautiful, and brief, And now its only task is to remember. THE FUTURE. Ask me not, love, what can be in my heart: While gazing on thee sudden tear-drops start, When only smiles should brighten where thou art. The human heart is compassed by fears; And joy is tremulousâfor it inspheres A vapoury star which melts away in tears. I am too happy for a careless mirth; Hence, thoughts the sweet, yet sorrowful, have birth:â Who looks from heaven is half return'd to earth. I feel the weakness of my loveâits care; How deep, how true, how passionate soe'er, It cannot keep one sorrow from thy share. How powerless is my fond anxiety! I feel I could lay down my life for thee; Yet know how vain such sacrifice must be! Ah, the sweet present!âshould it not suffice? Not to humanity which vainly tries To lift the curtain that may never rise! Hence do we tremble in our happiness; Hurried and dim the unknown moments press;â We question of the grief we cannot guess. The Future is more present than the Past: For one look back, a thousand on we cast; And hope doth ever memory outlast. For hope, say fear. Hope is a timid thing, Fearful and weak, and born 'mid suffering;â At least, such hope as our sad earth can bring. Its home, it is not here, it looks beyond; And while it carries an enchanter's wand, Its spells are conscious of their earthly bond. We almost fear the presence of our joy; It doth tempt Fate, the stern one, to destroy, Fate in whose hands this world is as a toy. We dearly buy our pleasures, we repay By some deep suffering; or they decay Or change to pain, and curse us by their stay. A world of ashes is beneath our feetâ Cold ashes of each beautiful deceit, Owned by long silent hearts, that beat as ours now beat. How can we trust our own? we waste our breath; We heap up hope and joy in one bright wreath;â Our altar is the graveâour priest is death. But, ah! death is repose;â'tis not our doom, The cold, the calm, that haunts my soul with gloom: I tremble at the passage to the tomb. Love mineâwhat depths of misery may lie In the dark future?âI may meet thine eye, Cold, careless, and estranged, before I die. All grief is possible, and some is sure; How can the loving heart e'er feel secure, And e'er it breaks it may so much endure? We had not lived had the past been foreshown; Ah! merciful the shadow round us thrown.â Thank heaven, the future is at least unknown! A LONG WHILE AGO. Still hangeth down the old accustomed willow, Hiding the silver underneath each leaf, So drops the long hair from some maiden pillow, When midnight heareth the else silent grief; There floats the water-lily, like a sovereign Whose lovely empire is a fairy world, The purple dragon-fly above it hovering, As when its fragile ivory uncurl'd A long while ago. I hear the bees in sleepy music winging From the wild thyme when they have past the noonâ There is the blackbird in the hawthorn singing, Stirring the white spray with the same sweet tune; Fragrant the tansy breathing from the meadows, As the west wind bends down the long green grass, Now dark, now golden, as the fleeting shadows Of the light clouds pass as they wont to pass A long while ago. There are the roses which we used to gather To bind a young fair brow no longer fair;â Ah! thou art mocking us, thou summer weather, To be so sunny, with the loved one where? 'Tis not her voiceâ'tis not her stepâthat lingers In lone familiar sweetness on the wind; The bee, the bird, are now the only singersâ Where is the music once with their's combined A long while ago? As the lorn flowers that in her pale hands perish'd Is she who only hath a memory here. She was so much a part of us, so cherished, So young, that even love forgot to fear. Now is her image paramount, it reigneth With a sad strength that time may not subdue; And memory a mournful triumph gaineth, As the slow looks we cast around renew A long while ago. Thou lovely garden! where the summer covers The tree with green leaves, and the ground with flowers; Darkly the past around thy beauty hoversâ The pastâthe grave of our once happy hours. It is too sad to gaze upon the seeming Of nature's changeless loveliness, and feel That, with the sunshine round, the heart is dreaming Darkly o'er wounds inflicted, not to heal, A long while ago. Ah! visit not the scenes where youth and childhood Pass'd years that deepen'd as those years went by; Shadows will darken in the careless wildwoodâ There will be tears upon the tranquil sky. Memories, like phantoms, haunt me while I wander Beneath the drooping boughs of each old tree: I grow too sad as mournfully I ponder Things that are notâand yet that used to beâ A long while ago. Worn outâthe heart seems like a ruin'd altar:â Where are the friends, and where the faith of yore? My eyes grow dim with tearsâmy footsteps falterâ Thinking of those whom I can love no more. We change, and others changeâwhile recollection Would fain renew what it can but recall. Dark are life's dreams, and weary its affection, And cold its hopesâand yet I felt them all A long while ago. EXPERIENCE. My very heart is filled with tears! I seem As I were struggling under some dark dream, Which roughly bore me down life's troubled stream. The past weighs heavily upon my soul, A tyrant mastering me with stern control; The present has no restâthe future has no goal. For what can be again but what has been? Soon the young leaf forgets its early green, And shadows with our sunshine intervene. Quenched is the spirit's morning wing of fire; We calculate where once we could aspire, And the high hope sets in some low desire. Experience has rude lessons, and we grow Like what we have been taught too late to know, And yet we hate ourselves for being so. Our early friends, where are they?ârather, where The fond belief that actual friends there were,â Not cold and false as all must find they are? We loveâmay have been lovedâbut ah! how faint The love that withers of its earthly taint, To what our first sweet visions used to paint! How have we been deceived, forgotten, flung Back on our trusting selvesâthe heart's core wrung By some fond faith to which we weakly clung. Alas! our kindest feelings are the root Of all experience's most bitter fruit; They waste the life whose charm they constitute. At length they harden, and we feel no more All that was felt so bitterly before, But with the softness is the sweetness o'er. Of things we once enjoyed how few remain! Youth's flowers are flung behind us, and in vain We would stoop down to gather them again. Why do we think of this?âbind the red wreathâ Float down time's water to the viol's breath, Wot not what those cold billows hide beneath. We cannot do this:âfrom the sparkling brink Drops the glad rose, and the bright waters shrink: While in the midst of mirth we pause to think;â And if we thinkâwe sadden:âthought and grief Are vowed companions; while we turn the leaf, It darkensâfor the brilliant is the brief. Ah! then, farewell ye lovely things that brought Your own Elysium hither!âoverwrought The spirit wearies with the weight of thought. Our better nature pinethâlet it be! Thou human soulâearth is no home for thee; Thy starry rest is in eternity! FRAGMENTS These fragments appeared orginally as mottoes to the Chapters of âEthel Churchill.â AGE AND YOUTH. âI tell thee,â said the old man, âwhat is life. A gulf of troubled watersâwhere the soul, Like a vexed bark, is tossed upon the waves Of pain and pleasure, by the wavering breath Of passions. They are winds that drive it on, But only to destruction and despair. Methinks that we have known some former state More glorious than our present; and the heart Is haunted by dim memoriesâshadows left By past felicity. Hence do we pine For vain aspiringsâhopes that fill the eyes With bitter tears for their own vanity. Are we then fallen from some lovely star, Whose consciousness is as an unknown curse?â MUCH CHANGE IN A LITTLE TIME. And she tooâthat beloved child, was goneâ Life's last and loveliest link. There was her place Vacant beside the hearthâhe almost dreamed He saw her still; so present was her thought. Then some slight thing reminded him how far The distance was that parted her and him. Fear dwells around the absentâand our love For such grows all too anxious, too much filled With vain regrets, and fond inquietudes: We know not Love till those we love depart. VANITY. Vanity! guiding power, 'tis thine to rule Statesman and vestrymanâthe knave or fool. The Macedonian crossed Hydaspes' wave, Fierce as the storm, and gloomy as the grave. Urged by the thought, What would Athenians say, When next they gathered on a market day? And the same spirit that induced his toil, Leads on the cook, to stew, and roast, and boil: Whether the spice be mixedâthe flag unfurledâ Each deems his task the glory of the world. SUCCESS ALONE SEEN. Few know of life's beginningsâmen behold The goal achieved;âthe warrior, when his sword Flashes red triumph in the noonday sun; The poet, when his lyre hangs on the palm; The statesman, when the crowd proclaim his voice, And mould opinion on his gifted tongue: They count not life's first steps, and never think Upon the many miserable hours When hope deferred was sickness to the heart. They reckon not the battle and the march, The long privations of a wasted youth; They never see the banner till unfurled. What are to them the solitary nights, Past pale and anxious by the sickly lamp, Till the young poet wins the world at last To listen to the music long his own? The crowd attend the statesman's fiery mind That makes their destiny; but they do not trace Its struggle, or its long expectancy. Hard are life's early steps; and, but that youth Is buoyant, confident, and strong in hope, Men would behold its threshold, and despair. LIFE'S MASK. Which was the true philosopher?âthe sage Who to the sorrows and the crimes of life Gave tearsâor he who laughed at all he saw? Such mockery is bitter, and yet just: And Heaven well knows the cause there is to weep. Methinks that life is what the actor isâ Outside there is the quaint and gibing mask; Beneath, the pale and careworn countenance. THE POET'S LOT. The poet's lovely faith creates The beauty he believes; The light which on his footsteps waits, He from himself receives. His lot may be a weary lot; His thrall a heavy thrall; And cares and griefs the crowd know not, His heart may know them all: But still he hath a mighty dower, The loveliness that throws Over the common thought and hour The beauty of the rose. HOPE. Is not the lark companion of the spring? And should not Hopeâthat sky-lark of the heartâ Bear, with her sunny song, Youth company? Still is its sweetest music poured for love; And that is not for me; yet will I love, And hope, though only for her praise and tears; And they will make the laurel's cold bright leaves Sweet as the tender myrtle. LOVE'S FOLLOWERS. There was an evil in Pandora's box Beyond all other ones, yet it came forth In guise so lovely, that men crowded round And sought it as the dearest of all treasure. Then were they stung with madness and despair; High minds were bowed in abject misery. The hero trampled on his laurell'd crown, While genius broke the lute it waked no more. Young maidens, with pale cheeks, and faded eyes, Wept till they died. Then there were broken heartsâ Insanityâand Jealousy, that feeds Unto satiety, yet loathes its food; Suicide digging its own grave; and Hate, Unquenchable and deadly; and Remorseâ The vulture feeding on its own life-blood. The evil's name was Loveâthese curses seem His followers for ever. THE WORLD WITHIN. There was a shadow on his face, that spake Of passion long since harden'd into thought. He had a smile, a cold and scornful smile; Not gaiety, not sweetness, but the sign Of feelings moulded at their master's will. A weary world was hidden at that heart; Sorrow and strife were there, and it had learnt The weary lessons time and sorrow teach; And deeply felt itself the vanity Of love and hope, and now could only feel Distrust in them, and mockery for those Who could believe in what he knew was vain. SECRETS. Life has dark secrets; and the hearts are few That treasure not some sorrow from the worldâ A sorrow silent, gloomy, and unknown, Yet colouring the future from the past. We see the eye subdued, the practised smile, The word well weighed before it pass the lip, And know not of the misery within: Yet there it works incessantly, and fears The time to come; for time is terrible, Avenging, and betraying. A COMPARISON. A pretty, rainbow sort of life enough; Filled up with vanities and gay caprice: Such life is like the garden at Versailles, Where all is artificial; and the stream Is held in marble basins, or sent up Amid the fretted air, in waterfalls, Fantastic, sparkling; and the element, The mighty element, a moment's toy; And, like all toys, ephemeral. OPINIONS. He scorned them from the centre of his heart, For well he knew mankind; and he who knows Must loathe or pity. He who dwells apart, With books, and nature, and philosophy, May lull himself with pity; he who dwells In crowds and cities, struggling with his race, Must daily see their falsehood and their faults, Their cold ingratitude, their selfishnessâ How can he choose but loathe them. LOVE'S TIMIDITY. I do not ask to offer thee A timid love like mine; I lay it, as the rose is laid On some immortal shrine. I have no hope in loving thee, I only ask to love; I brood upon my silent heart, As on its nest the dove. But little have I been beloved, Sad, silent, and alone: And yet I feel, in loving thee, The wide world is mine own. Thine is the name I breathe to Heaven, Thy face is on my sleep; I only ask that love like this May pray for thee and weep. THE VISIONARY AND THE TRUE. Ah! waking dreams that mock the day, Have other ends than those That come beneath the moonlight ray, And charm the eyes they close. The vision colouring the night 'Mid bloom and brightness wakes, Banish'd by morning's cheerful light, Which brightens what it breaks. But dreams which fill the waking eye With deeper spells than sleep, When hours unnumber'd pass us by; From such we wake and weep. We wake, but not to sleep again, The heart has lost its youth; The morning light that wakes us then, Cold, calm and stern, is truth. RESOLVES. What mockeries are our most firm resolves; To will is ours, but not to execute. We map our future like some unknown coast, And say, âHere is an harbour, here a rockâ The one we will attain, the other shun:â And we do neither. Some chance gale spring up And bears us far o'er some unfathom'd sea, Our efforts are all vain; at length we yield To winds and waves that laugh at man's control. WEAKNESS ENDS WITH LOVE. I say not, regret me; you will not regret; You will try to forget me, you cannot forget; We shall hear of each other, ah, misery to hear Those names from another which once were so dear! But deep words shall sting thee that breathe of the past, And many things bring thee thoughts fated to last; The fond hopes that centered in thee are all dead, The iron has entered the soul where they fed. Of the chain that once bound me, the memory is mine, But my words are around thee, their power is on thine; No hope, no repentance, my weakness is o'er, It died with the sentenceâI love thee no more! DEAR GIFTS. Life's best gifts are bought dearly. Wealth is won By years of toil, and often comes too late: With pleasure comes satiety; and pomp Is compassed round with vexing vanities: And genius, earth's most glorious gift, that lasts When all beside is perished in the dustâ How bitter is the suffering it endures! How dark the penalty that it exacts! GENTLENESS PICTURED. A gentle creature was that girl, Meek, humble, and subdued; Like some lone flower that has grown up In woodland solitude. Its soil has had but little care, Its growth but little praise; And down it droops the timid head It has not strength to raise. For other brighter blooms are round, And they attract the eye; They seem the sunny favourites Of summer, earth, and sky. The human and the woodland flower Hath yet a dearer part,â The perfume of the hidden depths, The sweetness at the heart. ORNAMENTS. Bring from the east, bring from the west, Flowers for the hair, gems for the vest; Bring the rich silks that are shining with gold, Wrought in rich broidery on every fold. Bring ye the perfumes that breathe on the rose, Such as the summer of Egypt bestows; Bring the white pearls from the depths of the seaâ They are fair like the neck where their lustre will be. Such are the offerings that now will be brought, But can they bring peace to the turmoil of thought? Can they one moment of quiet bestow To the human heart, feverish and beating, below? LIFE SURVEYED. Not in a close and bounded atmosphere Does life put forth its noblest and its best; 'Tis from the mountain's top that we look forth, And see how small the world is at our feet. There the free winds sweep with unfettered wing; There the sun rises first, and flings the last, The purple glories of the summer eve; There does the eagle build his mighty nest; And there the snow stains not its purity. When we descend, the vapour gathers round, And the path narrows: small and worthless things Obstruct our way: and, in ourselves, we feel The strong compulsion of their influence. We grow like those with whom we daily blend: To yield is to resemble. THE DISTURBING SPIRIT. Doubt, despairing, crime, and craft, Are upon that honied shaft. It has made the crowned king Crouch beneath his suffering; Made the beauty's cheek more pale Than the foldings of her veil: Like a child the soldiers kneel, Who had mocked at flame or steel; Bade the fires of genius turn On their own breasts; and there burn, A wound, a blight, a curse, a doom, Bowing young hearts to the tomb. Well may storm be on the sky, And the waters roll on high, When that passion passes by: Earth below, and heaven above, Well may bend to thee, O love! FATE. The steps of fate are dark and terrible; And not here may we trace them to the goal. If I could doubt the heaven in which I hope, The doubt would vanish, gazing upon life, And seeing what it needs of peace and rest. Life is but like a journey during night. We toil through gloomy paths of the unknown; Heavy the footsteps are with pitfalls round; And few and faint the stars that guide our way: But, at the last, comes morning; glorious Shines forth the light of day, and so will shine The heaven which is our future and our home. LOVE'S ENDING. And this, then, is love's ending. It is like The history of some fair southern clime: Hot fires are in the bosom of the earth, And the warmed soil puts forth its thousand flowers, Its fruits of goldâsummer's regality; And sleep and odours float upon the air, Making it heavy with its own delight. At length the subterranean element Bursts from its secret solitude, and lays All waste before it. The red lava stream Sweeps like a pestilence; and that which was A garden for some fairy tale's young queen Is one wild desert, lost in burning sand. Thus is it with the heart. Love lights it up With one rich flush of beauty. Mark the end: Hopes, that have quarrelled even with themselves, And joys that make a bitter memory; While the heart, scorched and withered, and o'erwhelmed By passion's earthquake, loathes the name of love. AFFECTION. There is in life no blessing like affection: It soothes, it hallows, elevates, subdues, And bringeth down to earth its native heaven. It sits beside the cradle patient hours, Whose sole contentment is to watch and love; It bendeth o'er the death-bed, and conceals Its own despair with words of faith and hope. Life has nought else that may supply its place: Void is ambition, cold is vanity, And wealth an empty glitter, without love. DOUBT. I tell thee death were far more merciful Than such a blow. It is death to the heart; Death to its first affections, its sweet hopes; The young religion of its guileless faith. Henceforth the well is troubled at the spring; The waves run clear no longer; there is doubt To shut out happinessâperpetual shade; Which, if the sunshine penetrate, 'tis dim, And broken ere it reach the stream below. FAITH ILL REQUITED. I feel the presence of my own despair; It darkens round me palpable and vast. I gave my heart unconsciously; it filled With love as flowers are filled with early dew, And with the light of morning. If he be false, he who appeared so true, Can there be any further truth in life, When falsehood wears such seeming? CONFIDENCE. Fear not to trust her destiny with me: I can remember, in my early youth, Wandering amid our old ancestral woods, I found an unfledged dove upon the ground. I took the callow creature to my care, And fain had given it to its nest again: That could not be, and so I made its home In my affection, and my constant care. I made its cage of osier-boughs, and hung A wreath of early leaves and woodland flowers: I hung it in the sun; and, when the wind Blew from the cold and bitter east, 'twas screened With care that never knew forgetfulness. I loved it, for I petted it, and knew Its sole dependence was upon my love. THE WRONGS OF LOVE. Alas, how bitter are the wrongs of love! Life has no other sorrow so acute: For love is made of every fine emotion, Of generous impulses, and noble thoughts; It looketh to the stars, and dreams of Heaven; It nestles 'mid the flowers, and sweetens earth. Love is aspiring, yet is humble, too: It doth exalt another o'er itself, With sweet heart-homage, which delights to raise That which it worships; yet is fain to win The idol to its lone and lowly home Of deep affection. 'Tis an utter wreck When such hopes perish. From that moment, life Has in its depths a well of bitterness, For which there is no healing. DANGERS FACED. My heart is filled with bitter thought, My eyes would fain shed tears; I have been thinking upon past, And upon future years. Years pastâwhy should I stir the depths Beneath their troubled stream? And years that are as yet to come, Of them I dread to dream. Yet wherefore pause upon our way? 'Tis best to hurry on; For half the dangers that we fear, We face them, and they're gone. A PORTRAIT. Many were lovely there; but, of that many, Was one who looked the loveliest of anyâ The youthful countess. On her cheek the dies Were crimson with the morning's exercise; The laugh upon her full red lip yet hung; And, arrow-like, light words flashed from her tongue. She had more loveliness than beautyâhers Was that enchantment which the heart confers. A mouth, sweet from its smiles; a large dark eye That had o'er all expression mastery, Laughing the orb, but yet the long lash made Somewhat of sadness with its twilight shade; And suiting well the upcast look that seemed, At times, as it of melancholy dreamed: Her cheek was as a rainbow, it so changed As each emotion o'er its surface rangedâ Her face was full of feeling. THE CORONATION. What memories haunt the venerable pile! It is the mighty treasury of the past, Where England garners up her glorious dead. The ancient chivalry are sleeping thereâ Men who sought out the Turk in Palestine, And laid the crescent low before the cross. The sea has sent her victories: those aisles Wave with the banners of a thousand fights. There, too, are the mind's triumphsâin those tombs Sleep poets and philosophers, whose light Is on the heaven of our intellect. The very names inscribed on those old walls Make the place sacred. SMALL MISERIES. Life's smallest miseries are, perhaps, its worst: Great sufferings have great strength: there is a pride In the bold energy that braves the worst, And bears proud in the bearing; but the heart Consumes with those small sorrows, and small shames, Which crave, yet cannot ask for sympathy. They blush that they exist, and yet how keen The pang that they inflict! MEMORY. Ah! there are memories that will not vanish; Thoughts of the past we have no power to banish; To shew the heart how powerless mere will, For we may suffer, and yet struggle still. It is not at our choice that we forget, That is a power no science teaches yet: The heart may be a dark and closed up tomb; But memory stands a ghost amid the gloom! THE FIRST DOUBT. Youth, love, and rank, and wealthâall these combined, Can these be wretched? Mystery of the mind, Whose happiness is in itself; but still Has not that happiness at its own will. She felt too wretched with the sudden fearâ Had she such lovely rival, and so near? Ay, bitterest of the bitter this worst pain, To know love's offering has been in vain; Rejected, scorn'd, and trampled under foot, Its bloom and leaves destroyed, but not its root. âHe loves me not!ââno other words nor sound An echo in the lady's bosom found: It was a wretchedness too great to bear, She sank before the presence of despair! THE PAST. Weep for the love that fate forbids; Yet loves, unhoping, on, Though every light that once illumed Its early path be gone. Weep for the love that must resign The soul's enchanted dream, And float, like some neglected bark, Adown life's lonely stream! Weep for the love that cannot change; Like some unholy spell, It hangs upon the life that loved So vainly and so well. Weep for the weary heart condemned To one long, lonely sigh, Whose lot has been in this cold world, To dream, despair, and die! SELF-BLINDNESS. What Shakspeare said of lovers, might apply To all the worldââ'Tis well they do not see The pretty follies that themselves commit.â Could we but turn upon ourselves the eyes With which we look on others, life would pass In one perpetual blush and smile. The smile, how bitter!âfor 'tis scorn's worst task To scorn ourselves; and yet we could not choose But mock our actions, all we say or do, If we but saw them as we others see. Life's best repose is blindness to itself. MUSIC OF LAUGHTER. She had that charming laugh which, like a song, The song of a spring-bird, wakes suddenly When we least look for it. It lingered long Upon the ear, one of the sweet things we Treasure unconsciously. As steals along A stream in sunshine, stole its melody, As musical as it was light and wild, The buoyant spirit of some fairy child; Yet mingled with soft sighs, that might express The depth and truth of earnest tenderness. THE ROSE. Why, what a history is on the rose! A history beyond all other flowers; But never more, in garden or in grove, Will the white queen reign paramount again. She must content her with remembered things, When her pale leaves were badge for knight and earl; Pledge of a loyalty which was as pure, As free from stain, as those white depths her leaves Unfolded to the earliest breath of June. WHAT IS SUCCESS? All things are symbols; and we find In morning's lovely prime, The actual history of the mind In its own early time: So, to the youthful poet's gaze, A thousand colours rise,â The beautiful which soon decays, The buoyant which soon dies. So does not die their influence, The spirit owns the spell; Memory to him is musicâhence The magic of his shell. He sings of general hopes and fearsâ A universal tone; All weep with him, for in his tears They recognise their own. Yet many a one, whose lute hangs now High on the laurel tree, Feels that the cypress's dark bough A fitter meed would be: And still with weariness and wo The fatal gift is won; Many a radiant head lies low, Ere half its race be run. HUMANITY ANGELIC. If ever angels walked on weary earth In human likeness, thou were one of them. Thy native heaven was with thee, but subdued By suffering life's inevitable lot; But the sweet spirit did assert its home By faith and hope, and only owned its yoke In the strong love that bound it to its kind. THE POET'S FIRST ESSAY. It is a fearful stake the poet casts, When he comes forth from his sweet solitude Of hopes, and songs, and visionary things, To ask the iron verdict of the world. Till then his home has been in fairyland, Sheltered in the sweet depths of his own heart; But the strong need of praise impels him forth; For never was there poet but he craved The golden sunshine of secure renown. That sympathy which is the life of fame, It is full dearly bought: henceforth he lives Feverish and anxious, in an unkind world, That only gives the laurel to the grave. GOSSIPPING. These are the spiders of society; They weave their petty webs of lies and sneers, And lie themselves in ambush for the spoil. The web seems fair, and glitters in the sun, And the poor victim winds him in the toil Before he dreams of danger, or of death. Alas, the misery that such inflict! A word, a look, have power to wring the heart, And leave it struggling hopeless in the net Spread by the false and cruel, who delight In the ingenious torment they contrive. UNAVAILING REGRET. Farewell! and when the charm of change Has sunk, as all must sink, in shade; When joy, a wearied bird, begins The wing to droop, the plume to fade; When thou thyself, at length, hast felt What thou hast made another feelâ The hope that sickens to despair, The wound that time may sear, not heal; When thou shalt pine for some fond heart To beat in answering thine again;â Then, false one, think once more on me, And sigh to think it is in vain. THE MARRIAGE VOW. The altar, 'tis of death! for there are laid The sacrifice of all youth's sweetest hopes. It is a dreadful thing for woman's lip To swear the heart away; yet know that heart Annuls the vow while speaking, and shrinks back From the dark future that it dares not face. The service read above the open grave Is far less terrible than that which seals The vow that binds the victim, not the will: For in the grave is rest. GIFTS MISUSED. Oh, what a waste of feeling and of thought Have been the imprints on my roll of life! What worthless hours! to what use have I turned The golden gifts which are my hope and pride! My power of song, unto how base a use Has it been put! with its pure ore I made An idol, living only on the breath Of idol worshippers. Alas! that ever Praise should have been what praise has been to meâ The opiate of the mind! THE FETE. There was a feast that night And coloured lamps sent forth their odorous light Over gold carvings, and the purple fall Of tapestry; and around each stately hall Were statues pale, and delicate, and fair, As all of beauty, save her blush, were there! And, like light clouds floating around each room, The censers sent their breathings of perfume; And scented waters mingled with the breath Of flowers that died as they rejoiced in death. The tulip, with its globe of rainbow light; The red rose, as it languished with delight; The bride-like hyacinth, drooping as with shame, And the anemone, whose cheek of flame Is golden, as it were the flower the sun, In his noon hour, most loved to look upon. At first the pillared halls were still and lone, As if some fairy palace, all unknown To mortal eye or step:âthis was not longâ Wakened the lutes, and rose the sound of song; And the wide mirrors glittered with the crowd Of changing shapes: the young, the fair, the proud, Came thronging in. LOVE. Love is a thing of frail and delicate growth; Soon checked, soon fostered; feeble, and yet strong: It will endure much, suffer long, and bear What would weigh down an angel's wing to earth, And yet mount heavenward; but not the less. It dieth of a word, a look, a thought; And when it dies, it dies without a sign To tell how fair it was in happier hours: It leaves behind reproaches and regrets, And bitterness within affection's well, For which there is no healing. WANT OF SYMPATHY. These are the things that fret away the heartâ Cold, cureless trifles; but not felt the less For mingling with the hourly acts of life. It is a cruel lot for the fine mind, Full of emotions generous and true, To feel its light flung back upon itself; All its warm impulses repelled and chilled, Until it finds a refuge in disdain! And woman, to whom sympathy is life, The only atmosphere in which her soul Developes all it has of good and true; How must she feel the chill! A POET'S LOVE. Faint and more faint amid the world of dreams, That which was once my all, thy image seems, Pale as a star that in the morning gleams. Long time that sweet face was my guiding star, Bringing me visions of the fair and far, Remote from this world's toil and this world's jar. Around it was an atmosphere of light, Deep with the tranquil loveliness of night, Subdued and shadowy, yet serenely bright. Like to a spirit did it dwell apart, Hushed in the sweetest silence of my heart, Lifting me to the heaven from whence thou art. Too soon the day broke on that haunted hour, Loosing its spell, and weakening its power, All that had been imagination's dower. The noontide quenched that once enchanted ray, Care, labour, sorrow, gathered on the day; Toil was upon my steps, dust on my way. They melted down to earth my upward wings; I half forgot the higher, better thingsâ The hope which yet again thy image brings. Would I were worthier of thee? I am fain, Amid my life of bitterness and pain, To dream once more my early dreams again. CHANGE. How much of change lies in a little space! How soon the spirits leave their youth behind! The early green forsakes the bough; the flowers, Nature's more fairy-like and fragile ones, Droop on the way-side, and the later leaves Have artifice and cultureâso the heart: How soon its soft spring hours take darker hues! And hopes, that were like rainbows, melt in shade; While the fair future, ah! how fair it seemed! Grows dark and actual. THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEAD. Who are the Spirits watching by the dead? Faith, from whose eyes a solemn light is shed; And Hope, with far-off sunshine on the head. The influence of the dead is that of Heaven; To it a majesty of power is given, Working on earth with a diviner leaven. To them belongs all high and holy thought; The mind whose mighty empire they have wrought; And grief, whose comfort was by angels brought. And gentle Pity comes, and brings with her Those pensive dreams that their own light confer; While Love stands watching by the sepulchre. PRIDE IN TRIFLES. Why, life, must mock itself, to mark how small Are the distinctions of its various pride. 'Tis strange how we delight in the unreal: The fanciful and the fantastic make One half our triumphs. Not in mighty thingsâ The glorious offerings of our mind to fate Do we ask homage to our vanities, One half so much as from the false and vain. The petty trifles that the social world Has fancied into grandeur. DEATH IN THE FLOWER. 'Tis a fair tree, the almond-tree: there Spring Shews the first promise of her rosy wreath; Or ere the green leaves venture from the bud, Those fragile blossoms light the winter bough With delicate colours heralding the rose, Whose own Aurora they might seem to be. What lurks beneath their faint and lovely red? What the dark spirit in those fairy flowers? 'Tis death! REMEMBRANCE. Pale Memory sits lone, brooding o'er the past, That makes her misery. She looketh round, And asks the wide world for forgetfulness: She asks in vain; the shadow of past hours Close palpable around her; shapes ariseâ Shadows, yet seeming real; and sad thoughts, That make a night of darkness and of dreams. Her empire is upon the dead and gone; With that she mocks the present and shuts out The future, till the grave, which is her throne, Has absolute dominion. INFLUENCE OF POETRY This is the charm of poetry: it comes On sad perturbed moments; and its thoughts, Like pearls amid the troubled waters, gleam. That which we garnered in our eager youth, Becomes a long delight in after years: The mind is strengthened and the heart refreshed By some old memory of gifted words, That bring sweet feelings, answering to our own. Or dreams that waken some more lofty mood Than dwelleth with the common-place of life. THE LAST NIGHT WITH THE DEAD. How awful is the presence of the dead! The hours rebuked, stand silent at their side; Passions are hushed before that stern repose; Two, and two only, sad exception shareâ Sorrow and love,âand these are paramount. How deep the sorrow, and how strong the love! Seeming as utterly unfelt before. Ah! parting tries their depths. At once arise Affection's treasures, never dreamed till then. Death teaches heavy lessons hard to bear; And most it teaches us what we have lost, In losing those who loved us. CHANGES IN LONDON. The presence of perpetual change Is ever on the earth; To-day is only as the soil That gives to-morrow birth. Where stood the tower there grows the weed; Where stood the weed the tower: No present hour its likeness leaves To any future hour. Of each imperial city built Far on the eastern plains, A desert waste of tomb and sand Is all that now remains. Our own fair city filled with life, Has yet a future day, When power, and might, and majesty, Will yet have passed away. PRESENTIMENT. I feel the shadow on my brow, The sickness at my heart! Alas! I look on those I love, And am so sad to part. If I could leave my love behind, Or watch from yonder sky With holy and enduring care, I were not loath to die. But death is terrible to Love: And yet a love like mine Trusts in the heaven from whence it came, And feels it is divine. AGE. Age is a dreary thing when left alone: It needs the sunshine brought by fresher years; It lives its youth again while seeing youth, And childhood brings its childhood back again. But for the lonely and the aged man Left to the silent hearth, the vacant home Where no sweet voices sound, no light steps come Disturbing memory from its heavinessâ Wo for such lot! 'tis life's most desolate! Age needeth love and youth to cheer the pathâ The short dark pathway leading to the tomb. HOPE AND LOVE. The sun was setting o'er the sea, A beautiful and summer sun; Crimson and bright, as if not night, But rather day had just begun: That lighted sky, that lighted sea, They spoke of Love and Hope to me. I thought how Love, I thought how Hope, O'er the horizon of my heart Had poured their light like yonder sun; Like yon sun, only to depart: Alas! that ever suns should set, Or Hope grow cold, or Love forget! A NOBLE LADY. A pale and stately lady, with a brow That might have well beseem'd a Roman dame, Cornelia, ere her glorious children died; Or that imperial mother, who beheld Her son forgive his country at her word. Yet there was trouble written on her face; The past had left its darkness. EXPERIENCE TOO LATE. It is the past that maketh my despair; The dark, the sad, the irrevocable past. Alas? why should our lot in life be made, Before we know that life? Experience comes, But comes too late. If I could now recall All that I now regret, how different Would be my choice! at best a choice of ill; But better than my miserable past. Loathed, yet despised, why must I think of it? BRIDAL FLOWERS. Bind the white orange-flowers in her hair Soft be their shadow, soft and somewhat paleâ For they are omens. Many anxious years Are on the wreath that bends the bridal veil. The maiden leaves her childhood and her home, All that the past has known of happy hoursâ Perhaps her happiest ones. Well my there be A faint wan colour on those orange-flowers: For they are pale as hope, and hope is pale With earnest watching over future years; With all the promise of their loveliness, The bride and morning bathe their wreath with tears. THE TEMPLE GARDEN. The fountain's low singing is heard in the wind, Like a melody bringing sweet fancies to mind; Away in the distance is heard the far sound From the the streets of the city that compass it round. Like the echo of mountains, or ocean's deep call: Yet that fountain's low singing is heard over all. The turf and the terrace slope down to the tide Of the Thames, that sweeps onwards a world at its side; And dark the horizon with mast and with sail Of the thousand tall ships that have weather'd the gale; While beyond the arched bridge the old abbey appears, Where England has garneredâthe glories of years. There are lights in the casementâhow weary the ray That asks from the night time the toils of the day! I fancy I see the brow bent o'er the page, Whose youth wears the paleness and wrinkles of age: What struggles, what hopes, what despair may have been, Where sweep those dark branches of shadowy green! THE LOST. I did not know till she was lost, How much she was beloved; She knows it in that better world To which she is removed. I feel as she had only sought Again her native skies; I look upon the heavens, and seem To meet her angel eyes. Pity, and love, and gentle thoughts, For her sake, fill my mind; They are the only part of her That now is left behind. DESPONDENCY. Ah, tell me not that memory Sheds gladness o'er the past; What is recalled by faded flowers, Save that they did not last? Were it not better to forget, Than but remember and regret? Look back upon your hours of youthâ What were your early years, But scenes of childish cares and griefs? And say not childish tears Were nothing; at that time they were More than the young heart well could bear. Go on to riper years, and look Upon your sunny spring; And from the wrecks of former years, What will your memory bring?â Affections wasted, pleasures fled, And hopes now numbered with the dead! THE MIND'S UNREST. Mind, dangerous and glorious gift! Too much thy native heaven has left Its nature in thee, for thy light To be content with earthly home. It hath another, and its sight Will too much to that other roam; And heavenly light and earthly clay, But ill bear with alternate sway: Till jarring elements create The evil which they sought to shun, And deeper feel their mortal state In struggling for a higher one. There is no rest for the proud mind, Conscious of its high powers confined; Vain dreams and feverish hopes arise, It is itself its sacrifice. IMMORTALITY. Strong as the death it masters, is the hope That onward looks to immortality: Let the frame perish, so the soul survive, Pure, spiritual and loving. I believe The grave exalts, not separates, the ties That hold us in affection to our kind. I will look down from yonder pitying sky, Watching and waiting those I love on earth Anxious in heaven until they too are there. I will attend your guardian angel's side, And weep away your faults with holy tears; Your midnight shall be filled with solemn thought: And when, at length, death brings you to my love, Mine the first welcome heard in paradise. BITTER EXPERIENCE. How often, in this cold and bitter world, Is the warm heart thrown back upon itself! Cold, careless, are we of another's grief; We wrap ourselves in sullen selfishness: Harsh-judging, narrow-minded, stern and chill In measuring every action but our own. How small are some men's motives, and how mean! There are who never knew one generous thought; Whose heart-pulse never quickened with the joy Of kind endeavour, or sweet sympathy.â There are too many such! THE HEART'S OMENS. I felt my sorrow ere it came, As storms are felt on high, Before a single cloud denote Their presence in the sky. The heart has omens deep and true, That ask no aid from words; Like viewless music from the harp, With none to wake its chords. Strange, subtle, are these mysteries, And linked with unknown powers, Marking mysterious links that bind The spirit world to ours. THE FATHER'S LOVE. 'Tis not my homeâhe made it home With earnest love and care; How can it be my own dear home, And he no longer there? I asked to meet my father's eyes, But they were closed for me; My father, would that I were laid In the dark grave with thee. Where shall I look for constant love, To answer unto mine? Others have many kindred hearts, But I had only thine. PARTING. We do not know how much we love, Until we come to leave; An aged tree, a common flower, Are things o'er which we grieve. There is a pleasure in the pain That brings us back the past again. We linger while we turn away, We cling while we depart; And memories, unmarked till then, Come crowding on the heart. Let what will lure our onward way, Farewell's a bitter word to say. LOVE A MYSTERY. It matters not its historyâLove has wings, Like lightning, swift and fatal; and it springs, Like a wild flower, where it is least expected; Existing, whether cherished or rejected. A mystery art thou!âthou mighty one! We speak thy name in beauty; yet we shun To say thou art our guest; for who will own His life thy empire, and his heart thy throne? HAPPINESS WITHIN. And yet it is a wasted heart: It is a wasted mind That seeks not in the inner world Its happiness to find; For happiness is like the bird That broods above its nest, And finds beneath its folded wings, Life's dearest, and its best. A little space is all that hope Or love can ever take; The wider that the circle spreads, The sooner it will break. THE POOR. Few, save the poor, feel for the poor: The rich know not how hard It is to be of needful food And needful rest debarred. Their paths are paths of plenteousness, They sleep on silk and down; And never think how heavily The weary head lies down. They know not of the scanty meal, With small pale faces round; No fire upon the cold damp hearth When snow is on the ground. They never by the window lean, And see the gay pass by; Then take their weary task again, But with a sadder eye. THE LITTLENESS OF LIFE. Life is so little in its vanities, So mean, and looking to such worthless aim, Truly the dust, of which we are a part, Predominates amid mortality. Great crimes have something of nobility; Mighty their warning, vast is their remorse: But these small faults, they make one half of life Belong to lowest natures, and reduce To their own wretched level nobler things. FAITH DESTROYED. Why did I love him? I looked up to him With earnest admiration, and sweet faith. I could forgive the miserable hours His falsehood, and his only, taught my heart; But I cannot forgive that for his sake, My faith in good is shaken, and my hopes Are pale and cold, for they have looked on death. Why should I love him? he no longer is That which I loved. A LADY'S BEAUTY. Ladye, thy white brow is fair, Beauty's morning light is there; And thine eye is like a star, Dark as those of midnight are: Round thee satin robe is flung; Pearls upon thy neck are hung: Yet thou wearest silk and gem, As thou hadst forgotten them. Lovelier is the ray that lies On thy lip, and in thine eyes. CURELESS WOUNDS. False look, false hope, and falsest love, All meteors sent to me, To shew how they the heart could move, And how deceiving be: They left me darkened, crushed, alone; My spirit's household god's o'erthrown. The world itself is changed, and all That was beloved before Is vanished, and beyond recall, For I can hope no more: The sear of fire, the dint of steel, Are easier than such wounds to heal. PLEASURE BECOMES PAIN. I cannot count the changes of my heart, So often has it turned away from things Once idols of its being. They departâ Hopes, fancies, joys, illusions, as if wings Sprang suddenly from all old ties, to start; Or, if they linger longer, life but brings Weariness, hollowness, canker, soil, and stain, Till the heart saith of pleasure, it is pain. EARTH LEADS TO HEAVEN. This is a weary and a wretched life, With nothing to redeem it but the heart. Affection, earth's great purifier, stirs Our embers into flame, and that ascends. All finer natures walk this bitter world But for a while, then Heaven asks its own, And we can but remember and regret. ILLUSION. And thus it is with all that made life fair, Gone with the freshness that it used to wear. 'Tis sad to mark the ravage that the heart Makes of itself; how one by one depart The colours that made hope. We seek, we find; And find, too, charm has, with the change, declined. Many things have I loved, that now to me Are as a marvel how they loved could be; Yet, on we go, desiring to the last Illusions vain, as any in the past. SELF-REPROACH. Deep in the heart is an avenging power, Conscious of right and wrong. There is no shape Reproach can take, one half so terrible As when that shape is given by ourselves. Justice hath needful punishments, and crime Is a predestined thing to punishment. Or soon, or late, there will be no escape From the stern consequence of its own act. But in ourself is Fate's worst minister: There is no wretchedness like self-reproach. LOVE'S SLAVES. Where is the heart that has not bowed A slave, eternal Love to thee! Look on the cold, the gay, the proud, And is there one among them free? And what must love be in a heart All passion's fiery depths concealing, Which has in its minutest part More than another's whole of feeling! GENIUS. Alas! and must this be the fate That all too often will await The gifted hand, which shall awake The poet's lute? and, for its sake, All but its own sweet self resign, Thou loved lute, to be only thine! For what is genius, but deep feeling, Wakening to glorious revealing? And what is feeling, but to be Alive to every misery? FALSE APPEARANCES. Who, that had looked on her that morn, Could dream of all her heart had borne? Her cheek was red, but who could know 'T was flushing with the strife below? Her eye was bright, but who could tell It shone with tears she strove to quell? Her voice was gay, her step was light, And beaming, beautiful, and bright: It was as if life could confer Nothing but happiness on her. Ah! who could think that all so fair Was semblance, and but misery there! REMORSE. Alas! he brings me back my early years, And seems to tell me what I should have been. How have I wasted God's best gifts, and turned Their use against myself! It is too late! Remorse and shame are crushing me to earth, And I am desperate with my misery! STERN TRUTH. Life is made up of vanitiesâso small, So mean, the common history of the day,â That mockery seems the sole philosophy. Then some stern truth starts upâcold, sudden, strange; And we are taught what life is by despair:â The toys, the trifles, and the petty cares, Melt into nothingnessâwe know their worth; The heart avenges every careless thought, And makes us feel that fate is terrible. THE POET'S PAST. Remembrance makes the poet: 'tis the past Lingering within him, with a keener sense Than is upon the thoughts of common men, Of what has been, that fills the actual world With unreal likenesses of lovely shapes That were, and are not; and the fairer they, The more their contrast with existing things; The more his power, the greater is his grief. Are we then fallen from some noble star, Whose consciousness is as an unknown curse: And we feel capable of happiness Only to know it is not of our sphere? THE POWER OF WORDS. 'Tis a strange mystery, the power of words! Life is in them, and death. A word can send The crimson colour hurrying to the cheek. Hurrying with many meanings; or can turn The current cold and deadly to the heart. Anger and fear are in them; grief and joy Are on their sound; yet slight, impalpable:â A word is but a breath of passing air. MOONLIGHT. The moonlight falleth lovely over earth; And strange, indeed, must be the mind of man That can resist its beautiful reproach. How can hate work like fever in the soul With such entire tranquillity around? Evil must be our nature to refuse Such gentle intercession. UNGUIDED WILL. God, in thy mercy, keep us with thy hand! Dark are the thoughts that strive within the heart, When evil passions rise like sudden storms, Fearful and fierce! Let us not act those thoughts; Leave not our course to our unguided will. Left to ourselves, all crime is possible, And those who seemed the most removed from guilt Have sunk the deepest! THE MASK OF GAIETY. 'Tis strange to think, if we could fling aside The mask and mantle many wear from pride, How much would be, we now so little guess, Deep in each heart's undreamed, unsought recess! The careless smile, like a bright banner borne; The laughlike merriment; the lip of scorn; And for a cloak, what is there that can be So difficult to pierce as gaiety? Too dazzling to be scanned, the gloomy brow Seems to hide something it would not avow; But mocking words, light laugh, and ready jest, These are the bars, the curtains to the breast. THE RUINED MIND. Ah! sad it is to see the deck Dismasted of some noble wreek; And sad to see the marble stone Defaced, and with gray moss o'ergrown; And sad to see the broken lute For ever to its music mute, But what is lute, or fallen tower, Or ship sunk in its proudest hour, To awe and majesty combined In their worst shapeâthe ruined mind? SORROWS AND PLEASURES. It is an awful thing how we forget The sacred ties that bind us each to each. Our pleasures might admonish us, and say, Tremble at that delight which is unshared: Its selfishness must be its punishment. All have their sorrows, and how strange it seems They do not soften more the general heart: Sorrows should be those universal links That draw all life together. THE YOUNG POET'S FATE. Trace the young poet's fate Fresh from his solitudeâthe child of dreams, His heart upon his lip, he seeks the world To find him fame and fortune, as if life Were like a fairy tale. His song has led The way before him; flatteries fill his ear, And he seems happy in so many friends. What marvel if he somewhat overrate His talents and his state! THE FEARFUL TRUST. It is a fearful trust, the trust of love. In fear, not hope, should woman's heart receive A guest so terrible. Ah! never more Will the young spirit know its joyous hours Of quiet hopes and innocent delights; Its childhood is departed. PEACE WROUGHT BY PAIN. Over that pallid face were wrought The characters of painful thought; But on that lip, and in that eye, Were patience, faith, and piety. The hope that is not of this earth, The peace that has in pain its birth; As if, in the tumult of this life, Its sorrow, vanity, and strife, Had been but as the lightning's shock, Shedding rich ore upon the rock: Though in the trial scorched and riven, The gold it wins, is gold from heaven. CUSTOM AND INDIFFERENCE. I cannot choose, but marvel at the way In which we pass our lives from day to day; Learning strange lessons in the human heart; And yet, like shadows, letting them depart. Is misery so familiar, that we bring Ourselves to view it as âa usual thing?â We do too little feel each other's pain; We do too much relax the social chain That binds us to each other; slight the care There is for grief, in which we have no share. YOUTH AND LOVE. Young, loving, and belovedâthese are brief words; And yet they touch on all the finer chords, Whose music is our happiness; the tone May die away, and be no longer known, In the sad changes brought by darker years, When the heart has to treasure up its tears, And life looks mournful on an altered sceneâ Still it is much to think that it has been. THE EARLY DREAM. Ah! never another dream can be Like that early dream of ours, When Hope, like a child, lay down to sleep Amid the folded flowers. But Hope has wakened since, and wept Itself, like a rainbow, away; And the flowers have faded, and fallen around, We have none for a wreath to-day. Now, Truth has taken the place of Hope, And our hearts are like winter hours; Little has after life been worth That early dream of ours. THE SICK ROOM. 'Tis midnight, and a starry shower Weeps its bright tears o'er life and flower; Sweet, silent, beautiful the night, Sufficing for her own delight. But other lights than sky and star, From yonder casement gleam afar; The lamp subdued to the heart's gloom Of suffering, and of sorrow's room. THE CHARM GONE. I did not wish to see his face, I knew it could not be, Though not a look had altered there, What once it was to me. Since last we met, a fairy spell Had been from each removed; How strange it is that those can change Who were so much beloved! It is a bitter thing to know The heart's enchantment o'er; But 'tis more bitter still to feel It can be charmed no more! THE FAREWELL. Farewell! Shadows and scenes that have, for many hours, Been my companions; I part from ye like friendsâ Dear and familiar onesâwith deep sad thoughts, And hopes, almost misgivings! FUGITIVE POEMS OF AN EARLIER DATE. THE LAST LOOK. â'Tis the very lightness of childish impressions that makes them so dear and lasting.â The shade of the willow fell dark on the tide, When the maid left her pillow to stand by its side; The wind, like a sweet voice, was heard in the tree, And a soft lulling music swept in from the sea. The land was in darkness, for mountain and tower Flung before them the shadows of night's deepest hour; The moonlight unbroken lay white on the wave, Till the wide sea was clear as the shield of the brave. She flung from her forehead its curls of bright hair,â Ere those ringlets fell round her another was there; Red flushed her cheek's crimson, and dark drooped her eye, A stranger had known 'twas her lover stood by. One note on his sea-call, the signal he gave, And a boat like a plaything, danced light on the wave; Her head on his shoulder, her hand in his hand, Yet the maiden looked back as they rowed from the strand. She wept not for parents, she wept not for friends, Yet fast the bright rain from her dark eye descends; The portionless orphan left nothing behind But the green leavesâthe wild flowers sown by the wind. But how the heart clings to that earliest love, Which haunts the lone garden, and hallows the grove; Which makes the old oak-tree and primrose-bank fair, With the memories of childhood whose playtime was there. 'Tis our spirits which fling round the joy which they take; The best of our pleasures are those which we make: We look to the past, and remember the while, Our own buoyant step and our own sunny smile. A pathway of silver was tracked on the wave, The oars left behind them the light which they gave, And the slight boat flew over the moonlighted brine, Till the coast afar-off was one shadowy line. They reached the proud ship, and the silken sails spread, And the gallant flag shone like a meteor blood red; And forth from the scabbard flashed out each bright sword, In fealty to her the young bride of their lord. From a cup of pale gold then she sipped the clear wine, And clasped on her arm the green emeralds shine; The silver lamps swinging with perfume were fed, And the rich fur beneath her light footstep was spread. From the small cabin window she looked to the shore, Lost in night she could see its dim outline no more: She sighed as she thought of her earlier hours, Ah, who will now watch o'er my favourite flowers!â ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA. AN ANECDOTE FROM PLUTARCH. Glorious was the marble hall With the sight and sound of festival, For autumn had sent its golden hoard, And summer its flowers to grace the board. Inside and out the goblets shine, Outside with gems, inside with wine; And silver lamps shed round their light Like the moonrise on an eastern night. Gay laughs were heard; when these were mute Came a voluptuous song and lute; And fair nymphs floated round, whose feet Were light as the air on which they beat; Their steps had no sound, they moved along Like spirits that lived in the breath of song. Beneath the canopy's purple sweep, Like a sunset cloud on the twilight deep, Sate the king of the feast, stately and tall, Who look'd what he was, the lord of all. A glorious scar was upon his brow, And furrows that time and care will plough. His battle-suns had left their soil, And traces of tempest and traces of toil; Yet was he one for whom woman's sigh Breathes its deepest idolatry. His that soft and worshipping air She loves so well her lover should wear; His that low and pleading tone That makes the yielding heart its own; And, more than all, his was the fame That victory flings on the soldier's name. Yet those meanings high that speak, Scorn on the lip, fire on the cheek, Tell of somewhat above such scenes as these, With their wasting and midnight revelries. Albeit he drain'd the purple bowl, And heard the song till they madden'd his soul; Yet his forehead grew pale, and then it burn'dâ As if in disdain from the feast he turn'd; And his inward thoughts sought out a home And dwelt on thy stately memory, Rome. But his glance met her's beside, and again His spirit clung to its precious chain. With haughty brow, and regal hand, As born but for worship and command, Yet with smiles that told she knew full well The power of woman's softest spell, Leant that Egyptian queen: a braid Of jewols shone 'mid her dark hair's shade. One pearl on her forehead hung, whose gem Was worth a monarch's diadem, And an emerald cestus bound the fold Of her robe that shone with purple and gold. All spoke of pomp, all spoke of pride, And yet they were as nothing beside Her radiant cheek, her flashing eye, For their's was beauty's regality. It was not that every feature apart, Seem'd as if carved by the sculptor's art; It was not the marble brow, nor the hair That lay in its jewel-starr'd midnight there; Nor her neck, like the swan's, for grace and whiteness, Nor her step, like the wind of the south for lightness; But it was a nameless spell, like the one That makes the opal so fair a stone, The spell of change:âfor a little while Her red lip shone with its summer smileâ You look'd again, and that smile was fled, Sadness and softness were there instead. This moment all bounding gaiety, With a laugh that seem'd the heart's echo to be; Now it was grace and mirth, and now It was princely step and lofty brow; By turns the woman and the queen, And each as the other had never been. But on her lip, and cheek, and brow, Were traces that wildest passions avow; All that a southern sun and sky Could light in the heart, and flash from the eye; A spirit that might by turns be led To all we love, and all we dread. And in that eye darkness and light Mingled, like her own climate's night, Till even he on her bosom leaning, Shrank at times from its fiery meaning. There was a cloud on that warrior's face, That wine, music, smiles, could not quite erase: He sat on a rich and royal throne, But a fear would pass that he sat there alone. He stood not now in his native land, With kinsman and friends at his red right hand; And the goblet pass'd unkiss'd, till the brim Had been touch'd by another as surety for him. She, his enchantress, mark'd his fear, But she let not her secret thought appear. Wreath'd with her hair were crimson flowers, The brightest that form the lotus bowers;â She pluck'd two buds, and fill'd them with wine, And, laughing said, âthis pledge be mine!â Her smile shone over their bloom like a charm, He raised them up, but she caught his arm, And bade them bring to the festive hall One doom'd to death, a criminal. He drank of the wine, he gasped for breath, For those bright, but poison'd flowers, held death; And turn'd she to Antony with the wreath, While her haughty smile hid the sigh beneath, âWhere had thy life been at this hour, Had not my Love been more than my Power? âAway, if thou fearest,âlove never must, Never can live with one shade of distrust.â EGERIA'S GROTTO. A silver Fountain with a changeful shade Of interwoven leaves and blossoms made; The leaves that turn'd the light to emerald green, While colour'd buds like rainbows shone between: And on the southern bank, as if beset With ocean pearls, grew the white violet; Above there stood a graceful orange-tree, Where Spring and Summer dwelt in amity, And shared the boughs between them,âone with flowers Its silver offering to the sunshine hours; The other with its fruit, like Indian gold, Or those bright apples the last lover roll'd In Atalanta's path and won the dayâ Alas! how often gold has led astray! The shadow of old chestnut trees was roundâ They were the guardians of the hallow'd ground; The hunter in his chase had past it by, So closely was it screen'd from curious eye. On the bank opposite to that, where strew'd Sigh'd the pale violets' sweet multitude, There was a little Grotto, and like stars The roof was set with crystal and with spars Trembling in light;âit needed much their aid, For at the entrance the dark branches play'd Of a lone cypress, and the summer-day Was changed to twilight as it made its way. It is Egeria's Grotto. Her bright hair Has left its odour on the fragrant air; The echo of her step is lingering still In the low music of the lute-toned rill; And here the flowers are beautiful and young As when beneath her ivory feet they sprung. Ay, this made Love delicious as a dream, Save that it was too constant but to seemâ No time to tire, gone almost soon as seen; Known but by happiness, that it had beenâ A shade, but such a shade as rainbows cast Upon the clouds, in its first beauty pastâ A mystery, such mystery as the breath Lurking in summer sweetness on a wreath, Which we would but enjoy, but not explore, Too blest in the pleased sense to desire more. And thus if Love would last, thus must it beâ A wish, a vision, and a fantasie. STANZAS ON THE NEW YEAR I stood between the meeting Years, The coming and the past, And I ask'd of the future one, Wilt thou be like the last? The same in many a sleepless night, In many an anxious day? Thank Heaven! I have no prophet's eye To look upon thy way! For Sorrow like a phantom sits Upon the last Year's close. How much of grief, how much of ill, In its dark breast repose! Shadows of faded Hopes flit by, And ghosts of Pleasures fled: How have they chang'd from what they were! Cold, colourless, and dead. I think on many a wasted hour, And sicken o'er the void; And many darker are behind, On worse than nought employ'd. Oh Vanity! alas, my heart! How widely hast thou stray'd, And misused every golden gift For better purpose made! I think on many a once-loved friend As nothing to me now; And what can mark the lapse of time As does an alter'd brow? Perhaps 'twas but a careless word That sever'd Friendship's chain; And angry Pride stands by each gap, Lest they unite again. Less sad, albeit more terrible, To think upon the dead, Who quiet in the lonely grave Lay down the weary head. For faith, and hope, and peace, and trust, Are with their happier lot: Though broken is their bond of love, At least we broke it not.â Thus thinking of the meeting years, The coming and the past, I needs must ask the future one: Wilt thou be like the last? There came a sound, but not of speech, That to my thought replied, âMisery is the marriage-gift That waits a mortal bride: But lift thine hopes from this base earth, This waste of worldly care, And wed thy faith to yon bright sky, For Happiness dwells there!â STANZAS. I know it is not made to last, The dream which haunts my soul; The shadow even now is cast Which soon will wrap the whole. Ah! waking dreams that mock the day Have other end than those, Which come beneath the moonlight ray, And charm the eyes they close. The vision colouring the night 'Mid bloom and brightness wakes, Banished by morning's cheerful light, Which gladdens while it breaks. But dreams which fix the waking eye With deeper spells than sleep, When hours unnoted pass us by, From such we wake and weep. We wake,âbut not to sleep again; The heart has lost its youth,â The morning light which wakes us then, Calm, cold, and stern, is Truth. I know all this, and yet I yield My spirit to the snare, And gather flowers upon the field, Though Woe and Fate are there. The maid divine, who bound her wreath On Etna's fatal plain, Knew not the foe that lurked beneath The summer-clad domain. But IâI read my doom aright, I snatched a few glad hours, Then where will be the past delightâ And where my gathered flowers? Goneâgone for ever! let them go! The present is my meedâ Aye, let me worship, ere I know The falsehood of my creed. The time may comeâthey say it mustâ When thou, my idol now, Like all we treasure and we trust, Will mock the votive vow. And when the temple's on the groundâ The altar overthrownâ Too late the bitter moral's found,â The folly was our own. It matters not, my heart is full With present hopes and fears, The future cannot quite annulâ Let them be bought by tears. Though sorrow, disbelief, and blame May load the fallen shrine; To think that once it bore thy name Will make it still divine. And such it wasâfor it was love's; And love its heaven brings, And from life's daily path removes All other meaner things; And calls from out the common heart Its music, and its fire; Like that the early hours impart To Memnon's sculptured lyre. A touch of lightâa tone of songâ The sweet enchantment's o'er; The thrilling heart and lute ere long Confess the spell do more. The music from the heart is gone; The light has left the sky; And time again flows calmly on, The haunted hour past by. And thus with love the charmed earth Grows actual, cold, and drear; But that sweet phantasy was worth All else most precious here. 'Mid the dark web that life must weave, 'Twill linger in the mind As angels spread their wings, yet leave The trace of heaven behind. Ah! let the heart that worships thee By every change be proved: Its dearest memory will be To know that once it loved. THE OLD TIMES. Do you recall what now is living only Amid the memories garnered at the heart?â The quiet garden, quiet and so lonely, Where fruit and flowers had each an equal part? When we had gathered cowslips in the meadow We used to bear them to the ancient seat, Moss-grown, beneath the apple-tree's soft shadow, Which flung its rosy blossoms at our feet, In the old, old times, The dear old times. Near was the well o'er whose damp walls were weeping Stonecrop, and grounsel, and pale yellow flowers, While o'er the banks the strawberry plants were creeping In the white beauty of June's earliest hours. The currant-bush and lilac grew together; The bean's sweet breath was blended with the rose; Alike rejoicing in the pleasant weather That brought the bloom to these, the fruit to those, In the old, old times, The dear old times. There was no fountain over marble falling; But the bees murmur'd one perpetual song, Like soothing waters, and the birds were calling Amid the fruit-tree blossoms all day long; Upon the sunny grass-plot stood the dial, Whose measured time strange contrast with ours made: Ah! was it omen of life's after trial, That even then the hours were told in shade, In the old, old times, The dear old times? But little recked we then of those sick fancies To which in after life the spirit yields: Our world was of the fairies and romances With which we wandered o'er the summer fields; Then did we question of the down-balls blowing To know if some slight wish would come to pass; If showers we feared, we sought where there was growing Some weather-flower which was our weather-glass: In the old, old times, The dear old times. Yet my heart warms at these fond recollections, Breaking the heavy shadow on my day. Ah! who hath cared for all the deep affectionsâ The love, the kindness I have thrown away? The dear old garden! There is now remaining As little of its bloom as rests with me. Thy only memory is this sad complaining, Mourning that never more for us can be The old, old times, The dear old times. SONG. Oh! breathe not of love, Or breathe not to me, If constant for aye Must your love-motto be. Where are the things The fairest on earth; Is it not in their change That their beauty has birth? The neck of the peacock, The iris's dyes, The light in the opal, The April-day skies:â Would they be lovely, As all of them are, But for the chance And the change that are there? Breathe no vow to me, I will give none of mine; Love must light in an instant, As quickly decline. His blushes, his sighs, Are bewildering things; Then away with his fetters, And give me his wings. CI-DEVANT! I cannot, if I would, call back again The early feelings of my love for thee, I love thee ever, but it is in vain To dream Love can be what it was to me. Some of its flowers have fallen from the chain, And showed that iron under them could beâ And it has entered in my soul: no more Can that soul revel in its dreams of yore. O no, my heart can never be Again in lighted hopes the sameâ The love that lingers thÃ¨re for thee Has more of ashes than of flame. Still deem not but that I am yet As much as ever all thine own; Though now the seal of love be set On a heart chilled almost to stone. And can you marvel? only look On all that heart has had to bearâ On all that it has yet to brook, And wonder then at its despair. Oh, Love is destiny, and mine Has long been struggled with in vainâ Victim or votary, at thy shrine There I am vow'dâthere must remain. My firstâmy lastâmy only love. O blame me not for that I dwell On all that I have had to prove Of Love's despair, of Hope's farewell. I think upon mine early dreams, When Youth, Hope, Joy, together sprung; The gushing forth of mountain-streams, On which no shadow had been flung. When Love seemed only meant to make A sunshine on life's silver seasâ Alas, that we should ever wake, And wake to weep o'er dreams like these! I loved, and Love was like to me The spirit of a faery tale, When we have but to wish, and be Whatever wild wish may prevail. I deemed that Love had power to part The chains and blossoms of life's thrall, Make an Elysium of the heart, And shed its influence over all. I linked it with all lovely things, Beautiful pictures, tones of song, All those pure, high imaginings That but in thought to earth belong. And all that was unreal became Reality when blent with theeâ It was but colouring that flame, More than a lava flood to me. I was not happyâLove forbade Peace by its feverish restlessness; But this was sweet, and then I had Hope, which relies on happiness. I need not say how, one by one, Love's flowers have dropp'd from off Love's chain; Enough to say that they are gone, And that they cannot bloom again. I know not what the pangs may be That hearts betray'd or slighted proveâ I speak but of the misery That waits on fond and mutual love. The torture of an absent hour, When doubts mock Reason's faint control:â 'Tis fearful thinking of the power Another holds upon our soul! To think another has in thrall All of life's best and dearest partâ Our hopes, affections, trusted all To that frail barkâthe human heart. To yield thus to another's reign;â To live but in another's breathâ To double all life's powers of painâ To die twice in another's death; While these things present to me seem, And what can now the past restore, Love as I may, yet I can dream Of happiness in Love no more. THE END.</field>
