      <field name="fulltext">I. TO THE PROTESTANT READER. I seeke not heere by curious words and phrase To catch the vaine aire of vncertaine prayse, Those ends are base: let seruile spirits choake Their best endeauours with that puffe of smoake; I only ayme in al that I haue done, By winning of thy soule, to gaine ames 5.20. my owne. II. Another to the same. Read, search, compare, quote, weygh, examine, al I wish thee, is, to be impartial. III. On the censuring Minister. Me thinkes I see some captious Minister Take vp my booke, and with a thought as farre From vpright iudgement, as my lines from lyes, Viewes euery page, and each citation tryes; But finding al exact, he carpes my stile, Censures my verse, and with a scornful smile Fy on this Priest (sayth he) what rime is this? What words are heer? this couplet is amisse; That phrase is of his owne inuention, new; This ouer-harsh, that England neuer knew, Haue patience, good Aminadab, heer's none Gaynsayes your censure; for to France alone, Whose ayre hath fed me from a child, I owe The litle of this litle which I know. How then should I inforraine countryes gaine That, to whose height few can at home attaine; I grant my lines are harsh, and doe not fal To please your eares, but yet I hope they gal. IV. On the same. Although t'were true that these my lines containe No good, no right, or wel applied straine, T'were not my fault, for what good can be wrought, Where the whole subiect of the whole is nought? V. LVTHERS CHANGE. To his much honoured freind W. T. While in the Roman Church your Luther staid, To tame his flesh he I punished my poore body (saith Luther) with fasting, watching, praying, and other exercises. Luth. vpon the Galath. Englished. fol. 37. fasted, watcht and prayd, Affected true I kept Chastitie, Pouertie, and Obedience. Luth. ib. fol. 38. obedience, liued poore, And carefully from carnal acts forbore. Al that he did was with a Whatsoeuer I did, I did it with a single hart, of a good zeale, and for the glory of God. ib. fol. 37. single hart, An vnfain'd zeale, empors'ned on no part With fond vaine glorie, but directed whole T'encrease God's honour and secure his soule. But thence gone forth, he sodainly became. So I am burned (saith Luther) with the great flame of my vntamed flesh; I who ought to be feruent in spirit, am feruent in the flesh, in lust, and slouth, &amp;c. Luth. tom. 1. epist. Latin. fol. 334. burned with his fleshes raging flame, As he grew almost He confessed himself to haue been almost mad through the rage of lust and desire of women. Colloq. mens. fol. 526, see also fol. 400. mad through lust; eight dayes Eight dayes are now past, wherin I neither write, pray, nor studie; being vexed partly with the temptations of the flesh, partly with other troubles, Luth. tom. 1. epist. Latin. fol. 334. He now wil spend, and neither studies, prayes, Nor writes, disturbed with inflamed veynes Of burning leacherie, and other paines.

Yet is it Luther confesseth (saith the learned Protestant Hospinian) that he was taught by the diuel, that masse, and chiefly priuat masse is naught, and that being ouercome by the diuel's reasons he abolisht it. Hist, Sacram. part. vlt. fol. 131. See more hereafter IX. 2. granted, Satan was the cause, Which mou'd him first the sacred Masse t'oppose. Why's Satan not Reformer then? 'tis true, He is indeed: Let's giue the diuel his due. VII. The fruits of Reformation. Protestants tel vs that before the light Of their new Ghospel men When we were seduced by the Pope, (saith Luther) euerie man did willingly follow good workes; and now euerie man neither saith, nor knoweth anie thing, but how to get al to himself by exacti?s, pillage, theft, lying, vsurie &amp;c. Luth. Dom. 26. post Trin. See M. Stubbes motiue to good works. p. 44. 45. were more vpright, Of better life, more truly vertuous, More Certainly to speake the truth, there is many times found c?scionabler &amp; plainer dealing am?gst most of the Papists, then among manie Protestants: and if we looke narrowly to the Ages past, we shal find more godlines, deuotion, and zeale (though blind) more loue one towards another, more fidelitie and faithfulnes euerie way in them, then is now to be found is vs. M. Stubbes motiue, p. 43. real, faithful, and Religious, And eu'ry way more giuen Is it not a shame vnto vs that our forefathers liuing in time of superstition &amp;c. should notwithstanding so farre passe vs in good works, as that we may not once be c?pared to them in any measure? M. Stubb. ib. p. 72. without compare To al good workes, then in their Church they are. For now, (say they) such as haue late embrace't Our Reformation doe repaire more fast Yo See before at 1. theft, exactions, lying, vsury, Excesse Another sort of Germans giue indeed place to God's word, that it may be preacht, but there is not found among them anie amendm?t of life, but horrible Epicurisme, and a beastlie life in their behauiour, drunken assemblies, lustful desires &amp;c. in lieu of fasts they giue themselues night and day to riotous banquets and continual drinking. Iac. And. ad c. 21. Luc. See also Melancth. ad c. 6. Matth. in drinking, What eye so blind, that it doth not gush out with teares to behold the miserie of our supposed glorious Church? I meane the great ignorance, the superficial worship of God, the fearful blasphemies &amp; swearings in houses &amp; streets &amp;c. the dishonour of Superiours, the pride, crueltie, fornication, adulteries, drunkennesse, coueteousnes, vsuries &amp; other like abominations &amp;c. O behold &amp; pittie the woeful and lamentable state of our Church in these things! See this in M. Powels book of things indifferent, p. 136. See likewise next before at 5. swearing, gluttony, And such foule vices as from hence proceed, Then did the former t'any vertuous deed. So that (thus stil themselues goe on) who would A If anie be desirous to see a great rable of knaues, of persons turbul?t, deceitful, coseners, vsurers, let him goe to anie cittie where the Ghospel is purely preached, &amp; he shal find them there by multitudes. For it is more manifest then the day-light, that there were neuer among the Ethnicks, Turkes, &amp; other Infidels, more vnbridled &amp; vnruly pers?s, with wh? al vertue &amp; honestie is quite extinct, then are am?g the professours of the Ghospel. Andr. Masc. domin. 1. Adu. See him also l. de prophet, Christi. and sym. Paulus in serm. dom. 13. post Trin.

In lieu of fasts wee See before at 5. haunt excessiue feasts Drink healths to make our selues and others beasts, Wrong See before at 7. and see likewise Sylu. Czecanonius de corruptis moribus, and Wygandus de bon. &amp; mal. Germani. marriage-beds, haunt stewes, and for our prayer In eu'ry place we curse, Prayers they turne into swearing &amp;c. and al this manner of life they tearme the ordinance of the Ghospel. Iac. Andr. Conc. 4. in c 2 Luc. See before at 6. blaspheme, and sweare. Our children they grow The children of them of the reformed Ghospel grow euerie day worse, more vntractable, and dare commit such crimes as euen the able men of former times were scarce subiect vnto. Io. Wygand. l. de bon. &amp; mal. Germ. worse, and dare such crimes As were scarce knowne to men of former times. Our Preachers labours, which should be assign'd Only to truth, are If you cast your eyes vpon Protestant Doctours, you shal find that some of them moued through vaine glorie, enuious zeale, and a preiudicate opinion, disorder the true doctrine, disperse and earnestly defend the false. Some of them without cause stirre vp contentions, &amp; with inconsiderate spight def?d them: manie wrest their doctrine euerie way, of purpose to please the Princes and people, by whose grace and fauour they are maintained. There are more, who with their euil and wicked life ouerthrow al that which by their true doctrine they had formerly built. Paul. Ebec prefat. comm. Philippi in epist. ad Corinth. guided with the wind Of popular applause, attended stil With hate and enuy: their malicious wil N'er giues them rest, but makes them seek out wayes How they debates and causelesse iarres may rayse. In their disputes they See next hereafter at VIII. throughout. wrest, peruert, and lye, Oppresse the truth, and from the point stil flye. Many besides are There are found no smal number of the Ministers of the Word, who are flatterers &amp;c. Io. Wygand. de bon. &amp; mal. Germ. flat'rers, and beleeue [illeg.] please the See before at 12. Prince or country where they liue. [illeg.] more with their vile wicked life doe shame Their Ghospels doctrine and themselues defame. So that we see, since we reiected Rome The world doth dayly worse and It is a wonderful thing and ful of scandal, that from the time in which the pure doctrine of the Ghospel was first recalled to light, the world should dayly grow worse. Luth. Ser. conuiu. Germ. f. 55. See him also in postil. sup. Euan. dom. 1. Aduent. worse become: For I may freely speake what I haue seen in the course of some trauels, and obseruation of some courses, that in Flanders was neuer more drunkennesse, in Italy more wantonnesse, in Iury more hypocrisy, in Turky more impiety, in Tartary more iniquity, then is practized generally in England, particularly in London, al this is seen &amp;c. M. Rich. Ieffrey serm. at Paules crosse. Octob. 7. an. 1604. and printed an 1605. p. 31. See before at 7. n'ere in Flanders was more drunk'nes seen, Th'Italians euer haue lesse wanton been, In Iury n'ere was more hypocrisy, Turky is freer from impiety, And Tartary lesse wicked is then those, Who euen in England now Rom's Church oppose, Al this themselues affirme, this few deny; Tâweer not good manners here to say they lye. VIII. An other vpon the same. I haue read (sayth that learned Protestant Zanchius) the Latin coppy of the Apology, and diligently read it ouer, not without choller, when I perceaued what manner of writing very many, let me not say for the most partial, doe vse in the Churches (as they are called) of the reformed Ghospel; who would seem notwithstanding to be Pastours, Doctours, &amp; Pillars of the Church. The state of the question that it may not be vnderstood, we often of set purpose ouerclowd with darknes: things which are manifest we impudently denie; things false we without shame auouch; things plainly impious we propose as the first principles of fayth, things orthodoxal we condemne of heresy; scriptures at our pleasure we detort to our owne dreames; we boast of Fathers when we wil follow nothing lesse then their doctrine; to deceaue, to calumniate, to raile is familiar with vs &amp;c. So as we may defend our cause, good or bad, by right or by wrong, al other things we turne vp-side-downe, Ã´ times! Ã´ manners! Zanch. epist. ad Io. Sturm. this in fine lib. 7. &amp; 8. Miscellan. The question's state we Ministers, to shrowd Our falshood, doe with darknes ouerclowd; Things that are plaine we shamelesly deny; Things false we al maintaine, yet know we lye. Impious things we as faith's grounds propose; And true things stil, as heresies, oppose. The scriptures we to our owne dreames doe wrest; We boast the Fathers, but their faith detest: To cheat, calumniate, glosse, deceaue, and raile Is our cheif practize: so we may preuaile 'Gainst our Opponents, al things we auouch But greatly care not what: I think not much. IX. ON ZVINGLIVS. When into Zuinglius Satan had infus'd Himself, and by those Zuinglius confesseth himself to haue been instructed against the Masse by a certain Admonisher, to vse his owne words, whether black or white he remembred not.

Calu. l. 2. act. 1. his name, did in a trice containe Such swarmes of heresies, as one might see, But such a Maister could his Maister be.

Luth. tom. 2. f. 107. it is no point of fayth. If any Papists doe this doctrine blame, Tel Doctour Martin Luther (sayth Luther himself) wil haue it so, and saith that a Papist and an Asse are directly the same. So is my wil, so I command, let my wil be my reas? &amp;c. And not much after, Luther, saith he againe, wil that it be so, and sayth that he is a Doctour more excellent then al that are in the Papacy. Tom. 5. Germ. fol. from 141. to 144. them, a Papist and an asse are th'same.

Luth. tom. 5. fol. 119. There is another like saying of Luther to this purpose, which because it is so beastly, and vnchristian-like a speach, I wil forbeare to translate it.

Among other wanton Epigrammes which Beza writ, there is one extant of his inordinate liking to his Ganimed called Andebertus, and his woman Candida, wherin he debateth whether sinne be may preferre, and finally makes choice of the boy before his woman. See this in Beza's Epigrammes print. at Paris an. 1548.

Sir, Since I saw you last, though many a hil, Plaines, woods, &amp; groues our bodies doe diuide, Your best part hath been present with me stil, Distance of place that from me nere could hide. The ghostly good derections, which by you It pleas'd the Spirit to me then impart Streight in my soule to such perfection grew As they nere shal, nor can from thence depart; You taught me then to know Rom's scarlet-whore And other points, which then I held amisse: Wherewith emboldned, now in one thing more Your graue aduice I craue, &amp; this it is. I doubt not but you know in what esteeme With our best Authours Austin's writings are. To some so free from errour he doth seeme As After the sacred Scriptures there is no Doctour in the Church who is to be compared to Austin. Luth. loc. com. class. 4 p. 45. none but Scripture may with him compare. Others doe stile him the poofund'st Diuine And great'st of Fathers, since th'Apostles were. Others affirme he did in learning shine Farre D. Couel in his answer to Io. Burges. aboue al that did or wil appeare. Others M.

Now to your last demand; make answer stil Your faith's not tyed vnto each man's tongue, T'Austin y' are ready to resigne your wil, As long as he doth to the Word no wrong.

Lay aside al such weapons as the ancient orthodoxal Fathers, Scholes of Diuines, authority of Councels and Popes, the consent of so many Ages &amp; of al Christian people doth afford: we receaue nothing but Scriptures; but so, that we alone may haue the approued authority of interpreting them &amp;c. Luther l. de seru. arbitr. contra Erasm. edit. prima. XXVI. A REPLIE TO THE precedent letter. Yours I haue read, and since you cannot giue Better solutions to my doubts, I grieue To haue so long insisted on the path Of your so much esteem'd, so empty Fayth. For, if We doe not depend (say many) on the Fathers, but on the words of God, &amp;c. But I wonder whether these men euer read ouer the writings of those Fathers, whom they railingly condemne for Sophistes. For if they haue read them, with what face dare they oppose them to the word of God, whom it is euident to haue only relied vpon God's word? but if they haue not read them at al, or but negligently read them, what a shame is it, that the schollers should become their Master's iudges, yea and that before they heare them? Thus farre Beza in lib. Epist. theolog. Epist. 81. (as Beza did himself reply To such as did the same with you deny) Austin and other Fathers did maintaine Those points for true, which you reiect as vaine; Why, as if you alone could neuer erre, Should you your iudgement before their's preferre, And neuer cease their writings to oppose Against the Scriptures, since they euery clause, No lesse then you, but with a more profound And deeper sight, did on the Scripture ground? The question therefore, as I thought before, Is not heer whether we should credit more God's word or them, each child can that decide, But whether now men's iudgements should be tyde To what you hold the Word's true sense to be, Or that whereon they iointly al agree. Heer lyes the doubt: when you doe them excel In this, I'l then returne; til then farewel. XXVII. Vpon Peter Martyr. When pale Simlerus in the life of Peter Martyr (saith Schlusselberg) affirmes that he dyed in the Sacramentary heresy, and said to Bullenger and others a little before his death, That he would not be in Brentius heau?, for that was no-where. Therefore, Ã´ Martyr, thou must stay in Zuinglius heauen, with Hercules and Socrates, (to wit) in hel; where thou, Ã´ Martyr, shalt be the diuel's euerlasting Martyr. Theolo.

Oecolampadius stil in outward shew Vow'd himself confident that al was true He either preach't or writ: but in his hart He Ioannes Cellarius, who by reason of this doubtfulnes of Oecolampadius forsooke the Sacramentaryes, heard him pray thus in his Chamber: O Lord God, if my cause be not true, doe not aduance it, I beseech thee.

And God in the rod of his fury visiting Caluin, did horribly punish him before the feareful howre of his vnhappy death; for he so struck this heretike with his mighty hand, that being in despaire, &amp; calling vp? the Diuel, he gaue vp his wicked soule, swearing, cursing, &amp; blaspheming. He dyed vp? the dissease of lice &amp; wormes, encreasing in a most loathsome vlcer about his priuy parts; so as none present could endure the stench. These things are obiected to Caluin in publike writing, in which also horrible things are declared concerning his lasciuiousnes, his sundry abominable vices, and Sodomitical lusts, for which (last) he was by the Magistrate (at Noyon) vnder whom he liued, branded on the shoulder with a hot burning-iron; vnto which I yet see not any sound &amp; cleere refutation made &amp;c. I haue read Beza, &amp; I know that he writes otherwise of the life, manners, and death of Caluin; but since he himselfe is infected with the same heresy, and almost the same sinne, as the history of his strumpet Candida witnesseth, no man can in this matter giue credit to him.

But al these ioyn'd in one shew no effects Of discord, equal to our moderne fects; They are diuided into Lutherans, And Sacrament-blaspheming Zuinglians And these againe both subdiuided, The Lutherans are diuided principally into the Antinomi, Osiandrians, Maiorists, Synergists, Stancarians, Amsdorfians, Flaccians, Substantiarians, Accidentarians, Adiaphorists, Musculans, Pfeffingerians, Vbiquitists. Al which how they dissent and persecute one an other, and many of them not so much as permit their Aduersaries to abide in the same Towne with them, the Histories of Osiander, Maior, Zuinck feldius, Illyricus, Spangenbergius, Stancarus, Heshusius, and others doe sufficiently manifest. For the yet more ful declaration whereof, I referre you to the catalogue of the Lutherans books against Lutherans, in the end of the Protestants Apologie. Vpon due consideration of which their diuisions, Oecolampadius doubts not to tel them, saying: If we reflect vpon your dissenti?s, surely there are almost sound among you seauenty seauen changes, not only in your explanations of scripture, but also in certaine imaginary phantasies.

But the dissention of Sacramentaries was such euen in Luthers tyme, that he affirmed of them, That he scarce euer read of any a more deformed heresy, which presently in the beginning was diuided into so many heads, such a number of sects, not one like another, &amp; such variety of disagreeing opinions.

Let vs not be ashamed to confesse Christ crucified but let the signe of the Crosse be confidently imprinted with our finger in the forehead, and in al things els: Let there be made a Crosse when we eate bread, when we drinke, when we goe forth, when we come in, before sleep, when we lye down, and when we rise; when we goe and when we rest. Cyril Hierosol. Catech. 13. At the table, when we see lights, in our chamber, when we sit, what conuersation soeuer we be busyed in, we stil make the signe of the crosse in our forehead. Tertul. de Corona militis c. 3.Before they went to sleep, when they awak't Before they rose, when they their rest forsak't, When they were drest, before they tooke the ayre, When they began to study, or prepare To eate, or drink, or talk, or light to see, Or what soe're they did, immediately They with the Crosse against al future harme, Their forehead, brests, and other parts did arme When the soldier of Christ had thus said, he fortified himselfe with the signe of the Crosse, and with constancie of mind and vndanted countenance, without changing colour at al, he ioyfully went to punishment. Basil, in magn. orat. Gord. Mart.Did euer Tyrant seek by threats or paine T'enforce them from Christs holy truth refraine? Lest they perhaps vnarm'd should loose the field 'Gainst threats and paine the Crosse was stil their shield. By the signe of the Crosse al magike is depressed, sorcery made of no effect &amp;c. Athanas. de Incarnat. Verbi.Did any e're by magike art intend To trouble them? The same Crosse was their freind. Making the signe of the Crosse, he without any feare drunke the poyson. Greg. Mag. de Sabino Episcopo. Idem lib. 2. Dial. c. 3. where he writes that a poysoned glasse was broken by the signe of the Crosse, as with a stone.Did any to them, vnder faire pretence Of loue, giue poyson? Th'Crosse was their defence They euer held, Good Zealous, doe not grudge Heer to admit now an vnpartial Iudge, Whether 'tis fitter I my selfe resigne To their so general iudgement, or to thine? What doe the diuels feare? What doe they tremble at? Doubtles at the Crosse of Christ, in which they were subdued, in which &amp;c. Feare therfore &amp; trembling wil surprize them when they see the signe of the Crosse faithfully fixed in vs. Orig. Hom. 6. in &amp; Hom. 8. in diuersos Euangelij locos. Cyrillus Hieros. Catech. 13. Ephrem. ad Monachos paren. 2. Hieron. ad Psal. 85.They held, I say, that Diuels euer feare Before the Ensigne of the Crosse t'appeare; That Crosses can euen with their very sight. A man vsing the signe of the Crosse doth driue away the deceits of the diuel &amp;c. Athana. de Incarnatione Verbi &amp; in vita Antonij.Detect their slights, and put them al to flight: A certaine man called Ioseph, a Patriarch among the Iewes, become a Christian, did take a vessel of water before them al, and with a lowd voice, imposing with his owne finger the signe of the Crosse vpon the vessel, &amp; calling vpon the name of Iesus, said thus: In the name of Iesus of Nazareth, whom my forefathers crucified, be there power in this water to confound enchantments and magike &amp;c. which done, al the enchantments were forthwith dissolued. Epiph. Her. 30. cont. Ebionitas.That crosses can to water power impart Streight to dissolue the slights of diuelish art, The Bishop Donatus came not armed against the Dragon with sword, speare, or dart, but made against him the Crosse with his finger in the ayre, and spit in his face. The Dragon no sooner receiued the spits into his mouth, but instantly dyed. Sozomen. l. 7. c. 23. &amp; Chrisost. hom. 55. in Mat.That Crosses had wild beasts to mildnes brought Of miracles wrought by the Crosse read Theodoret. in vita S. Iuliani, &amp; vita S.

Sulpicius in vita S. Martiani with infinit more.That Crosses diuers miracles had wrought: How great a terrour this signe of the Crosse is to the diuels, he may wel know, who hath seen how, adiured by Christ, they fly forth of the bodies which they had possest: for as he with a word &amp;c. so now his followers cast those foule polluted spirits forth of men, both with the name of their Master, and with the signe of his passion. Lactant. lib. 4. Instit. cap. 27.That Crosses without doubt can dispossesse The impression of the vital signe freeth vs from carnal desires, and frames our life to the imitation of God. Dionys. Areop. Eccl. Hierar.That Crosses can our loose desires represse. That such as ere to Crosses haue recourse What dost thou thinke the diuel wil suffer, if he see thee hold that sword wherwith Christ quaild his power? &amp;c. Chrisost. hom. 55. in Mat.Need not to dread the power of hellish force. Be not thou therfore ashamed of so great a good, lest when Christ shal come in his Maiesty he be ashamed of thee: for then shalt thou see this signe more bright then the sunne beames before Christ &amp;c. Idem in hom. 55. in Mat.They gaue vs counsel not to be asham'd To vse that Crosse, wherwith hels pride was tam'ed, Lest when that Christ shal in the fearful day That glorious Ensigne in the ayre display He our disdaine with death shal prosecute And be asham'd to heare our shameles sute. The Crosse is become more famous then diadems or crownes; neither is there a crowne greater or ornament to the head, then is the Crosse, which is more worthy of al honour. Idem. ibidem.They priz'd a Crosse more highly farre then gemmes Then gold, then pearle, then Crownes, or diadems, And thought the Crosse which on the ground was worne, More then the Crowne which Princes heads adorne. Theodorus and Valens added the cause of this their statute to be Ne sacrum signum pedibus calcaretur, Lest the holy signe should be troden vnder-foot. l. 1. Codi. tit. leg. cum fit nobis. We ought to blesse our forehead and brest with the Crosse of our Lord, and we tread it vnder our feet. Paul. Diac. lib. 18. rerum Roman. It was a saying of the Emperour Tyberius 2.So that the Emperours for reuerence sake Gaue special charge none on the ground should make The Crosse, because they held it farre vnmeet, That blessed signe should be defil'd with feet. But it was then (though no-where now at al) Wherfore let vs with gentle diligence ingraue the Crosse in our ch?bers, in the wals, in the windowes, in our foreheads. Chrisost. Hom. 55. in Mat. And in an other place he saith: It is on the wals and tops of howses, in bookes, in Cities, in townes inhabited and not inhabited. Quod Christus sit Deus. Ruffinus Eccles. hist. lib. 2. c. 29.First on each window, and on euery wal. The same Crosse then the top of houses crownes Adornes great Cities, graces countrey Townes; Shines bright in holy Churches, no place free From that deuotion-stirring mysterie; Which to confirme since scriptures were not found, Of these (to wit the making the signe of the Crosse in the forehead) and other such like doctrine, if you expect authority from scripture, you shal find none: tradition shal be alleaged to be the authour, custome the confirmer, and faith the obseruer Tert. de corona milit is cap. 3. the same saith S. Basil de Spiritu Sancto c. 27.They thought Tradition a sufficient ground. And yet thy, Brother, zeale doth neuer doubt At this so much respected signe to flout, Others vse to make the signe of the Crosse vpon them with their fingers, to the end that by this signe they may be safe from the Diuel &amp;c. this is not piey but magike Ioannes Brentius in Catechis. explicans symbolum Apostolorum.And say that when the diuel doth depart At sight therof, it is by magike art: Christ crucified is better represented by a Cow then a Crucifixe. Who belch forth this blasphemy see in Beza Colloq. Mompelgar. pag. 406.And (thou, good Reader, heer auert a while Thy face, lest that this clause thy eyes defile, And thou, sweet Iesus, pardone the words I hate, I but thy foes blasphemous words relate) And that more truely then a crosse, a Cow Doth to vs al Christ crucified shew. Tel me be ey and nay (for vnto thee The spirit reueals al truth) how can it be That such great men should walke so farre astray And only thou find out the neer high-way? Perhaps they al were fooles, thou only wise, Thou to be blinded world a sunne did'st rise, To chase al misty shades thou wast elect, As worthier farre then they for to detect Their faults, and best deseru'dst that vnto thee The spirit should shew the truth. Yes verily. FINIS.</field>
