As the worthy, prudent Secretary In those daies, named Danucius Wrote volumes large, of famous memory Onely to prefer, and make glorious The name of his Lord, called Aurelius Thinkyng it sinne, rebuke and shame Out of his boke, to seclude his name. Eucolpius, euen in like case Preferred, Alexander Seuerus Whiche in his tyme, so worthy was The Romain Cato, with Titus Liuius Aduaunced the name, of Ceasar Iulius Thus one after other, their time did apply To that entent, good fame shuld not dy. Euen so most mighty, and gracius prince Under support of your benigne grace, I mindyng sleuth, vtterly to conuince As most vnworthy, folowyng their trace Your redoubted father, in euery lyke case For to aduaunce, my wittes will frame With the most worthlest, to set out his name After shall intreate, of his magnificence His lawes, statutes, his Ciuil ordinaunce His mighty powre, his wonderfull prudence His iust iudgem?tes, his rightfull gouern?ce Namely to speake of very true substance His graces lawes, most godly deuised Lately into Wales, to vs there commised With a certayne true comparison Whiche was most worthiest, of Antiquitie The Romains, with their foundacion Ether the Brutes, with their posteritie And of their Cities, the soueraigntie Which of them twayne, shuld other surmo?t London or Rome, as after shall recount. With an extract, or a Genealogy Conueiyng his, and your most noble discent As auncient Aucthors, putteth in memory From the fyrst age, to this time present Accordyng to their myndes, &amp; true iudgement Who wrote the same, in time long paste To that intent, it shuld indure and last. Consideryng the high magnificence Of your father, most clerely did shyne Passing al other, in princely excellence None to be compared before his tyme Al men perceiue, your nature doth inclyne To amplify the same, more out at large Surmo?ting the steps of your fathers stage In whom consisteth, our confidence Our hope, our trust, our consolacion Wherin nature, sheweth an euidence Accordyng to our expectacion To folowe the same, by inclinacion With your mother, most gracious Quene Whose vertue plaine, in your face is sene. Thus God of his deuine myght Hath indued, your most noble maiestie As appeareth to euery mannes syght Whose incomperable dexteritie In learnyng, hauyng a soueraigntie Passyng all other, by reporte of name Consideryng your age, this is the fame. The procedynges, of your noble age Doth vs encourage, your subiectes trewe Well perceauyng, your verteous courage Most godly stories, for to insewe Which doth insence: my hert doth renewe To dedicate this vnworthy litell boke Unto your highnes, therevpon to loke. Whiche was begon, in your fathers time Unto whose highnes, I minded the same But death alas, his life did vptwyne Before I coulde my purpose well frame Preuenting al thinges, but his worldly fame Whiche may not passe, wither, nor yet decaie His famous report, indure shal alway. O ye infernal systers of the darcke nighte With Cerberus in Hel, as Poetes doth fain Of all nobilitie, the quenchers of lighte Whose crueltie, no wight can restrayne Ye cut the thred, ye parte in twayne The life of man, without respecte The poore ye spare, the noble reiecte. Cursed be ye, ye doughters of Hell Whiche are in number, counted but three Cloto, Lachesis, and Atropos the fell Ye might haue spared, your crueltie A littel tyme, of our felicite Untill our king, most noble of corage Had proceded into moo yeares of age. What I haue written in sentence playne In laude or prayse, of your father dere Unto your highnes, let it remayne As though it did, to your grace appere Written of your selfe, as matter clere With no lesse zeale, obedience and loue Then duetie may obserue, increase and moue I do confesse, and this is trewe If Cato the sage, or prudent Tully With their fyled tonges, and sentence newe Were here again his grace to magnify As they dyd the Romains glorify Yet shulde they not, as in this case Worthely geue prayse, vnto his grace All thynges remembred as of my parte Most humbly desireth, your noble grace With constant wyll, and faithfull heart To pardon my boldenes, foly and trespace Consideryng alway, as in this case That euery trewe heart, inforced is To rendre his loue, duetie and seruice. The ende of the preface. The Chronicle of the Brutes. In the Golden tyme when al thynges florished As it were, by deuyne prouidence And that nature in manne was stablished. Hauyng reason, wisdome and science By gifte of the high magnifycence To vnderstand, determine and knowe The Heauens aboue, and the earth alowe. Then the wyse, sage and auncient By great industry and diligent laboure By sobre respecte and great aduisement Made lawes, statutes, with other good order Man to stablyshe, onely by fauoure Them to conducte, sauely to bryng Unto knowledge, wisdome and learnyng. Thus by politike moderacion Without rigoure, or cruel ordinaunce Prynces notable, of intencion Hauyng poure and mightye gouernaunce Established lawes, by discrete purueyaunce Onely theyr subiectes, to keepe in awe Dreadyng God, and fearyng his lawe. Such Princes, kinges &amp; famous Emperors Of duetie ought to be magnified Not onely as worthy Conqueroures But as men with grace nutrified Whose actes are worthy to be specified Enrolled vp with golde pearle and stone Registred in a boke, them selfes alone. Like as the Romains wyse &amp; circumspect In tyme long past, their fame to aduaunce All notable thynges, as in effecte Made by statutes, or Ciuill ordynance Registered was, for a remembraunce Their Senate onely to magnify By fam? report, as thei thought th? worthy. The Romaines most commended Ceasar The Troians Hector the famous knyghte The Percians, great Alexander The Grekes Achilles, for manhode &amp; myghte The Carthagiens, to maintain their righte Affirmyng Hanniball, their lodesterre Thus euery one, his tyme dyd preferre. And we Arthur most worthyest of all Ought to remember, in our fantasy Passyng all other, in deedes marciall Like Mars him selfe, shinyng in glory In his triumphes, conquest and victory As the story of him dothe recounte All other kinges in his time dyd surmount. As that tyme is past, and worne out This tyme present, we must put in vre That in time to come, there be no doute But that this tyme, that time may assure For time once past, is without recure Wherfore this tyme, let vs intende The time to come, may this time c?mende. Let the Romains, aduaunce their Ceasar The Troian Hector, their famous knyght The Percian their great Alexander The Greke Achilles, for strength &amp; myght The Carthagiens, to maintain their ryghte Onely preferryng, their Hannyball Yet haue we one, passyng them all. Whiche we ought of duety and reuerence Most humbly, his grace to magnify Salute in heart, worde and sentence Somwhat of hym to exemplify I meane our kyng, most famous Henry Our naturall Lord, our supreme hed Most renoumed, and most to be dred. Lyke as Cato, the prudent counceler Wrote volumes large, of famous report Prynces notable, onely to preferre Among the Romaynes, vertue to supporte Whose example, is to our comforte Folowyng the same, vice to confounde Thus of our dutie, surely are we bounde. Wherfore I wyll my pen aduaunce Mekely thereto my selfe incline With most dilygent attendaunce Directyng my style, this present tyme In worde and sence, straight as a lyne With Rome, Carthage, Thebes &amp; other mo As farre as the best, his fame to goo. Lyke as Phebes, in the midday spere His radiant beames, moste pure and bryghte Illustreth out, bothe freshe and cleare Persyng the dewes, by force of might I illuminyng all maner of syght Comforting frutes, flowers earbes &amp; grasse So doth our king, al other kynges passe. I wold to Chryst that my edicion Accordyng to my iudgement Myght take effecte, like my intencion In thynges condyng worthy or equiuolent Unto his grace, this tyme present Then wolde I, the truthe declare Which am inforced with termes rude &amp; bare Yet neuerthelesse, my inwarde desyre Without any more loquacitee Greatly I seke, as reason doth requyre For to approue, his noble maiestie Of all other kinges, to haue the soueraintee As sonne and ayre, to lusty dame nature Resemblyng her person shape and fygure. I dare alledge, as in this case That nature sought, tyme oportune When she first formed, his noble grace Onely by respecte, of gentell Fortune All other causes, for to contune Assured together, by promise bounde That in his parson, no faulte were founde. Thus hathe nature, by great aduisemente With circumspecte deliberacion Full lyke a Goddesse, pure and excellent shewed her powre, and mighty operacion Nothyng reseruyng, at his creacion Whiche myght his nobilitee aduaunce Unto his byrthe she gaue suche attendaunce. With strength, beawtie, and semelynesse She hath amplyfyed his courage Most renoumed, for gentlenesse Therin he hathe so great aduauntage Passyng all other, his parentage Thus by report, preferred is his name Intitled in the boke, of worthy fame. Gentelst of Gentyles, grace to recure Like Alcibyades, that famous knyghte Alcibiades of Athenes. Of Athenes prince, their party to assure So is his grace, most gentelest in syghte Whose inwarde respecte, iudgyng a ryghte A prynce of nature, that gentle is Of faythfull subiectes, can neuer mysse. For like as gentlenes, doth playne appere Onely by naturall inclinacion In countenaunce, in speache and cheare So dothe the loue, and hearty affection Exclude all maner of contencion Causeth subiectes, them selfes to endeuer Where gentlenes is, in loue to perceuer. By his gentlenes, our wr?ges ar redressed By his gentlenes, our loue made pardurable By his gentlenes, the truth out expressed Our heartes are made sure, and veritable His gentlenes is so resemblable That al thinges to him, he doth accumulate Whiche to gentlenes is appropriate. So that his grace, passeth all other An euident thyng for to declare There reigned, neuer suche another His subiectes to kepe, preserue and spare Wherfore we may in this compare All most one thyng, as in degree His gentlenes, to mercyfull pitie. For that lande dominion or regiment That hathe a prince, of gentell nature God hathe promised, long stablishment In loue together, they shall indure Wherfore in this, let vs assure Sith gentlenes commeth of gyft deuine Let vs to gentlenes, our heartes incline. Thus are we bounde, plainly to expresse His gentlenesse, onely to discure conseruyng our wealth, and whole redresse By his grace, lately put in vre Of his lawes, nowe are we made sure Among the mountaynes hilles and vales Now is it England, somtime called Wales, And further in this to reporte Accordyng to his mercifull yousage Our abusions onely to transporte Hath deuised with his counsayl sage Wales to conducte from all bondage Brefely to conclude, this to vnderstand Priuileged we ar, with the lawes of Engl?d Like as Minos, that famous kyng Minos king of Crete Somtime raignyng, in the land of Crete Full renoumed for science and connyng Founde out the lawes, most holsome &amp; swete Grounded on reason, with vertue replete Ministryng them, as a iudge royall Among his subiectes, by deedes equal. Prouidyng before, in his aduertence None shoulde declyne, as in this case For lacke of knowledge, and experience So ready he was, their welthe to purchace Thus of his liuyng, and bountifull grace Preparyng in tyme, them to aduaunce Onely by lawe, and Ciuil ordinaunce. Though he wer a kyng, with scepter and croune To execute right, noth?g disdained For all his fame, his princely renoume In iudgement sate, his domes vnfayned Loue nor hate, his person constrayned But like the deserte, as then did appere His sentence gaue, with right princely chere. Methamorphosios, there may ye se Of Mines the princely gouernaunce Also of Scille voyde of all pitie Her father slewe with cruell vengeaunce Onely of Minos, to haue acquaintaunce And he agayne like a ryghtfull kyng Gaue sentence plain, her dede condempning. For to affyrme and brefely conclude Our partie in this, fully to sustayne Unto Minos with lyke similitude Let vs aduaunce, our kyng and souerayne In all thynges that dothe appertayne Unto Iustice, or good gouernaunce By lawe, reason or Ciuill ordynaunce. Was there euer yet, any prince liuyng In Chronicle, story, or sentence playne His noble grace, in this resemblyng Or common welthe, for to sustayne Or for our sake, vndertoke suche payne As dothe his grace, this present tyme Us to preserue from damnable cryme. Howe far were we, out of oure way For lacke of Iustice and good gouernaunce Was there euer any, before this day Kyng or prynce, of suche remembraunce Us to instructe, by lawe or ordinaunce Wherby we myght, our foly redresse Till now his grace, the truthe to confesse. Whiche by study, and diligent laboure Most circumspectly, herein aduised For to reforme, our olde behauiour His gracious lawes, to vs hath commised To the entent we shulde not be supprised By bondage inforced with crueltee From olde customes, set vs at lybertee. We must of force, the truthe confesse We cannot well, our selues excuse Our deedes playnely beareth witnesse Of our folly and great abuse Olde customes had, lothe to refuse Surely at the fyrste, howe they began Not pleasyng to God, nether yet to man. For among al, some customes we had Whiche before God were intollerable As I suppose, all men beyng sadde Will graunt it, trewe and veritable A thyng vniuste falce and flexable Though some affirmed their customes sure By Charter Riall, euer to indure. Some Lordes no doute had great rialtie Conserued by kinges, in times long past In Forest and Chace, hauyng libertie But not their subiectes, to spoyle and waste By colour or craft, suthe meanes to caste Them to kepe in thraldome and bondage Where they ought, no dewtie nor seruage.

This Edippus with full pure entent Goyng towarde Thebes, that famous citie Of aduenture met this cruell Serpent Uppon the mountayne, called Phocie Of his manfull, Magnamitee There he slewe this monsterous beast Settyng the countrey, and Thebes at rest But our Edippus, refuge and Champion Our comforte our ioye and heartes solace Our noble, most famous of renoune Our kyng most worthiest that euer was Onely by prudence, hath brought to pas A thousande hath slayne, as in effecte Whiche of suche cryme, by force wer detecte.

These tirantes great, by odius cryme Accused were, of thefte and robbery Bryngyng the countrey, vnto ruine Spoilyng the people, of malice and enuy Delityng in murder, and tiranny Whiche caused Hercules, maugre their wyll Them to betray, and after to kyll. Here must ye note, marke this ryght well As Diodorus, affirmeth it playne Also Sainct Ierome, likewyse doth tell How that there were, Hercules twayne Whiche were ryght noble, stories be playne But Hercules, named Egipcius Was he that dyd, these dedes meruaylous. Not Hercules, called Alcides Whiche the Greekes, so highly do commend Sonne of Iupiter, this is douteles To whose powre he myght not extend Who euer wyll the cause defend Loke in the fifth boke, of Antiquities Of Birosus, the Ethimologies. As in a treatise, lately compyled After my simple, and rude deuice As auncient Aucthors, hathe comprysed In time long past, right famous and wyse Whiche to set forth, I did enterpryse Where ye may see, of these nobles twayn For the c?mon welth, which toke most payn.

Where are become, these tirauntes great So insaciate, of their desyre Whose rauin some time, no man could let So inraged was, their mortall yre Who durst denay, what they did require To burne or spoyle, all was one thyng Suche was their vse, custome and liuyng.

Yf they were taken, as seldome was sene They wolde alledge, for theyr defence The Lord of the soyle myght them redeme And of this roialtee, with them dispence Suche was their vse, and vyle pretence Paiyng therfore, their fine accustomed From all daungier, to be franchysed The partie nothyng herein suffysed Must nedes of force, his wrong sustayne Goddes people vtterly despysed The trewe man the losse, the thefe the gayne Restitucion none should they attayne Fiue pounde and a peny, paid for the fyne The Thefe goeth quite, for fault and crime. And yet alas, one custome we had Whiche as I thincke, all grace dyd expell I suppose neuer none halfe so bad Ingendred in the pitte of Hell The pryce of a man, was knowen to well Yf he were slayne, the paiment should be Lyke as he was, in byrthe or degre. O custome vnkynde, causer of distresse Whose terrible plage, infecteth the Ayre Mannes lyfe with murdre, to represse Consideryng Christ, mannes solle to repayre Became man, of a Uirgyn fayre Onely for loue, man to redeme Alas that man, with murdre shuld be sene. Murdre of truthe, is intollerable Murdre before God, calleth for vengeaunce Murdre to man, is abhominable Murdre to nature, is a defiaunce Murdre to lyfe, is a discontinuance Murdre to grace, is playne a rebell Murdre at the first, began sure in Hell. This was our co?trey brought in defame Sclaundred and noysed, for our outrage All trewe men of this reaported shame God knoweth who had the pylage The poore man, but small aduauntage The Thefe his pleasure, on mountayn &amp; hyll Yf he had money, myght walke at his wyll. Thus the slaunder ranne far abrode All most to our greate desolacion As thoughe we all had ben of one accorde No diuersitee in their opinion Suche was the rumoure and communicaci? Nothyng reseruyng in their iudgement Betwene a Thefe and the Innocent. And thus full ofte, we bare the blame causeles, of truethe nothyng offended Nor by consent, worthy of infame Yet by report we were suspended As though we had, therto intended Idelnesse was cause, as in effecte Why we were had in suche respecte. vici? Sardanipall.Oh thou vicious Sardanipall The beginnyng of slouthe and Idlenesse Whose example all welth dooth appall Delightyng in synne and wretchednesse With surfeites great, the body to oppresse Whiche brought in thefte and robery Murder, riote, also aduoutry. Who list the story, to accompte Shall well perceiue, in sloth and idlenesse All other before the, thou didst surmounte Thy vicious life, bereth full witnesse She was thy lady and chiefe mastresse To whom thou didst, thy self abounde Whiche was the cause thy person to c?fo?d For Arbachus, of vertues respecte Uerteous Arbachus As a prince of excellent wisedome Did thee manace, chastice and correcte For thy froward, abhominacion Idlenesse was cause, and occacion Why thou vicious Sardanapall From thyne estate, had so greate a fall For like as verteous businesse Inuenteth thynges right laudable So doth riote and idlenesse Increase mischenes intollorable One thyng marke, whiche is veritable Put idlenesse, clene out of vre For custome all moste, turneth to nature. Note where idlenesse, doth oft remayne Fare well all verteous businesse For idlenesse, inflameth the brayne And bryngeth in newe fanglenesse Sequestrith the herte, from all goodnesse And aldre last, note this for euer God from man, it doth cleane deceiuer. Idlenes, caused our abusion By idlenes, increased our infame Till now of late, by politicke reason Of our kyng, moste gracious of name Whiche hath brought vs into a new frame So that we fele, by worldly businesse There commeth gayne, and moderat richesse Thus hath our wise worthy Arbachus Suppressed our foly and customes rude Causyng our hertes, to be desirus To folowe the sage, multitude Idlenes vtterly to exclude Laboryng abrod, our fode to gete Leuyng by our handes, and bodely sweate. To digge and delue, to eare and sowe To graffe or plant, in rough or playne On mountayns hie, or vales lowe Litle we force, for labor and payne So that we maie, our welth attayne Tenderyng so muche our businesse That we forget, the vice of idlenesse. For where of truthe, with vs late past Bothe corne and fruite, was scant and bare Our countree voyde, laie halfe in wast I dare allege, and surely declare Now at this tyme we maie well spare If there should chaunce, a tyme of nede With corne and cattaile, our neighbors fede And thus daily, we do preuaile In our increase, bothe cataile and corne Thankes be to God, all is quoche quaile The chaffe the wedes, a waie are shorne Neuer so well, sens we wer borne Our countree made playne, and habitable Whiche semed before, irrecurable. And further, of his benyng grace Through his moste mercifull assent Our commune welth, for to purchace Hath remitted, of pure intent Two thousande markes, of yerely rent Before paied, in siluer and golde Taxed emong vs, of customes olde. Yet hath our Troian, most mighty emperoure Planted vs, with prudent Catons To be our president and gouernour Associate with noble Sipious With diuerse mo, of high discressione For to augment, our common weale Graunted by comission, vnder his seale. In sundery partes, for our redresse As did some tyme, the noble senate Consules prefectes, of greate sadnesse Dictatours full famous, of estate Decemuires, wisedome to approbate Trauersyng the countries rounde aboute Where suspecte persones, wer had moste indoubte. To that intent, our ciuility Wer not suppressed, for lacke of gouernance Nether is inforced, by tyrrany But redused, to a Ciuile substance Accordyng to the vse, and continuance Of Englishe lawes, in tyme long past Wherof we bee now, made sure and fast. Thus charge vpon charge, daily doth insewe Unto his grace, in maner importable Inuentyng lawes, and statutes newe Gentill and softe, by meane tretable To thentent, it should bee pardurable Emong vs for euer, this is the meane Uncorrupted to kepe vs pure and cleane. Thus a kyng of vigilant respecte Sheweth vnto vs, this constant loue As a father, in this effecte Tenderyng his childe, vice to remoue Without rigoure, our foly doth reproue Caryng not for treasure or expence But to withdrawe, the cause of our offence. For to compare, and brefe the tyme Accompt all stories, that euer was Inforce your self, thereto to inclyne Rede where ye list, your tyme to pas And ye shall not finde, that euer there was A kyng of better remembrance His subiectes to kepe, preserue and aduance. Reken Cesar, with his triumphes all Alexander Hector, or Achilles Edippus, or worthy Haniball Minos the Iudges, or greate Harcules Or yet Arbachus, of knighthod pereles Let theim come all, their vertue to declare Yet shall thei not, with his grace compare. For these princes, these conquerors great Set their mynde, and full attendance Countrees to subdewe, &amp; kyngdoms to geate Onely by strength and mightie puysance And some again, to take their chance Ieopard their persones, to get theim a name As beastes wilde, to make theim tame. And thus thei wrought all by fantasy As fortune list, the party assure To win or lose, put in ieopardy Hap as it would, all inaduenture Goodes, landes, life, body and treasure But those kynges, are moste to be comm?ded Fr? vicious life, their subiectes hath def?ded.

Some what herin, doubtles am I moued For to expresse, my fantasy Not of impacience, muche greued But that some, hath iudged wrongfully As in reproche, of our country Deniyng playne, moste noble Brute Our antecessor our stocke and our frute. A boke of late, there was compiled Polidorus.By Polidorus, in Italy borne Nothyng to vs reconsiled But rather written, in hatred or scorne Yet shall we saie, if he had sworne We Welshmen, with hym shall compare For olde antiquities, the truth to declare. His slanderous stile, to exterminate Reiect, auoyde, and cleane put a waie Whiche is so subtle, and intricate Thynkyng therby, our fame to decaie None will so reporte, I dare well saie Hauyng wit, reason or intelligence Ether to iustice, myndyng aduertence. Not contented, this to deny But would of force, our name appall Cleaue to extincte, out of memory As though we wer, reiectes of all Knowyng not, our discent naturall From whence we came, nor of what lyne Us to infame, this is his cryme. Me thinke of truth, to muche ye erre In your reproche, spoke of disdain Affirmyng plaine, in tyme of warre We Welshemen, no honor to attain Nether yet in peace, trewe to remain Your barberous wordes, backe doth rebo?de To your infame, all thynges doth sounde. It is vnmete, a man of your age Accompted sadde, wise and discrete So violently abrode to rage Matters to penne, whiche is vnmete With wordes vntrew, with termes onswete Or thynges deny whiche auctours olde In tyme long past, bothe wrote and tolde. Who shal but thinke, your sentence light As thynges in vain, to none effecte Wordes of reproche, spoke again right Menne should abhorre, and cleane reiecte To breue my tyme, this is the effecte Your slaunderous wordes, affirmeth plaine To rise of ire, hatred or disdayne. If ye of force, will vs persewe Onely through your ingratitude Blame vs nothyng, your wordes exchewe Beware hurie not, a multitude Lest some perchaunce, with sentence rude Iustely again, like your offence Euen with the same, will you recompence. We speake to you, Master Polidorus Whose ingratitude, we greatly complain Ye go aboute, to rase out the floures Of our Parentes, as thynges in vain And yet of truthe, ye cannot refrain But generally, vs to accuse No indifferency, herin ye vse. We Welshemen saie for our defence That ye Romayns, surmountyng in pride With your Imperiall magnificence Supposyng therby, the heuens to deuide Came long after, our noble tribe So that we maie, write of your estate Not ye of vs, ye came all to late. How should ye knowe, our antecessours Our stocke, our line, our progeny Our moste mightie conquerours Sithe ye bee of muche lesse memory Writyng nothyng, almoste plainly But what doth rebounde, to your estate Magnifiyng the pompe, of your Senate. By cause your auctoure, Titus Liuius Of noble Brute maketh no mencion Beyng perchaunce, somewhat obliuius Or knewe not, of that succession Therfore ye make no discripcion But onely of your kynges of Italie Whiche reigned there, successiuely. As appereth, by storie euident Called Fasciculus Temporum Where litle is, to vs pertinent But to the first, of your succession Hauyng the regall possession Breuely doth passe, all other thynges Onely doth write, but of a fewe kynges. Though he forgate, this noble prince Or listed not, his fame to conuaie Yet shall he not his name conuince Nor this his honor, to pulle awaie Fasciculus Temporum, plainly doth saie That Brute beganne, first to excell Wh? Heli was prieste, and Iudge of Israel Holy Eusebius, doth testifie Also sainct Bede, maketh mencion That noble Brute of the age, fiue and thirty Entered first into this region Whiche was before Christes incarnacion A thousand .i.C. twenty and twayne And after Troye .xliii. yeres playne Galfridus affirmeth assuredly That noble Brute, in his yeres grene Like Marce for strength, fearce and hardy In Grece moste princely was sene Wan there croune, ceptre and diademe From Panderus, of Achilles blud His doughter, his treasure, with all his gud. And further the Grekes to deface That daie he did, the felde recure Moste princely, met them in the face Whose knightly strokes, thei might not indure A shilde he bare, the felde of asure Three crounes of gold, sumteously wrought A Lion sette, on his helmet a lofte.

But god of his grace, his power to w?drawe Sapor Caused Sapor that time kyng of Perce For all his froward, and cursed lawe His imperiall powre, sone to successe Toke him prisoner, in middes of the Prece Made a fote stoole, of his cursed Corse When euer he lyst, to mount on his Horsse. Likewise the tiraunt, named Domician Domician Proudest of all, recken any one Persecuted many a Christian man Into Pathmos, exiled Sainct Ihon Thought him selfe, most worthiest alone In his estate, proudly vp stalled A God abrode, for to be called. Made a decree, of very presumpcion In paine of death, no man to deny But God aboue, knowyng his intencion To punishe his pride, in his owne army Caused his knightes, to wounde his body With vnware death, the story to expresse Denied of buriall, was his Carcasse. Maxence Most cruell infamed Maxence Likewyse our Faith, he did pursewe Causeles with most cruell violence Hauyng no respecte, to Christ Iesu Slayne as a traytour, to God vntrewe Of very disdayne, his life once past His cursed troncke, into Tybre was cast. Galerius Galerius falseste of assent Against Christes Faith, sought occasion Them to destroy, by furious iudgement Whiche was at length, to his confusion With sicknesse take, thus in conclusion The Ayre corrupted, gan to putrify Onely by stincke, of his carren body Also valence, the prowes Emperour Ualence.Whiche in his rage, was so mercylesse Against Hermites, them to deuoure Liuyng in desert, and wildernesse Slewe them all of very wilfulnesse Consumed he was, by brennyng of Fyre By the Gootes, which his death dyd conspire Most cursed of all, that I rehearse can Among all your falce conspiratours Iulian Apostita. Was your Emperour, named Iulian Whiche wrought by crafty inuencions Called sprytes, by his Coniuracions Did them worship, by way of sacrifice Unto God most hatefull, in such maner wise With them he had, suche conuersacion That they to hym, were fauourable For his Ceremonies, and falce oblacion Promisyng him, to be veritable That he shoulde passe, in deedes honorable Great Alexander, in triumphant victory As in excellyng, his state and glory. Thus fell he into fayned fantasy Trustyng to Pluto, the God infernall But then the Lorde most mighty Disdayned his pryde, Imperiall Send vnto him a knyght Immortall Most Angelicke, in stele armed bryght Roue hym to the hearte in his most myght. Among all other, that I can rede Most vicious, and odius to heare Was cursed Nero, without feare or drede Uicius Nero. Whose shamful story, plainly doth appere Consydre it well: ye Romains drawe nere Suche do ye foster, nurrishe vp and bryng Hatefull to God, most froward in liuyng Who was more vicious of nature By constraint of his disposicion Who was more vnsure, grace to recouer Then was Nero, by inclinacion More prouder of port, with fraude &amp; treason His wife his brother, causelesse he slewe No matter of right, them to pursewe. This story right sore, doth him accuse With his mother called Agripine Like a ribauld her body shuld mysuse In carnal knowlage, filthy as a swine And further playnely to defyne His mothers wombe, he corue vpon a day To se the place, nine monethes where he laie. This proud tirant, vnfortunate man SenecMorall Senec, causeles he slewe Which was his maister when he began Uirgins profest, he dyd pursewe Beyng right chaste, stedfast and true His Lecherus lust, onely to fulfyll Rauished them of force, against their wyll Peter and PauleYet moreouer, this Fend infernall Against Christes faithe, most dispiteous Slewe the Apostles, Peter and Paule For which vengeance, &amp; deedes most lecherus God gaue him ouer, as man vngracious With a dagger, roue him selfe vnto the hert Died for payne, anguishe and deadly smarte. Thus God of his righte, tir?tes can chastyce Which wil rebell, against pore innocencie Them to murdre, and will not aduertise In Christ to haue, trewe confidence They must of force, without assistence Remayne with Cerberus, the Hell hound Linked with T?talus in chaines fast bound. Of our Emperours, a ful great number I coulde resite froward of courage Christes faithe, causeles to incumber I will let pas, all the surplusage No more to speake, of fraude and pyllage Neither murdre, treason, with their infame Set them together, with rebuke and shame. Can ye deny, but this is trewe Why do ye then, vs Brutes accuse We are right lothe, our faultes to renue But sithe ye causeles, do vs misuse As in report, ye cannot refuse Grosse is his witte, worthy of infame That will not defend, his countrey &amp; name, If ye loke well, and iudge a ryght Ye ought not vs, Welshmen disdayne Sith we with all our force and might Your holy men did entertayne From your exile, and cruell payne When that they durst, no where abyde For their refuge, we did prouide. For in the time, of your great outrage When no man myght, your malice intreate So wilfull were ye, of minde and corage Christ and his lawes, sone to forget His electe to kyll, malice and threate Of very constraint, inforced to flee So cruell and merciles, that time were ye. Helpe or redresse, none could they finde Their carefull life, for to assure Their inspyred heartes, their constant minde Inforced were, lacke of recure To seke abrode, their harde aduenture Where that they might, with pure intent Christes religion for to augment. Then into Wales, they dyd approche Through Goddes prouidence, his myght to shewe Under many a str?g mighty roche Builded their Chappels, in desertes lowe In sondry places, as men doth knowe As at this day, plainely doth appere The places olde, euident and clere. This is no fayned inuencion Neither yet no curious fable Who lyst to loke, without suspection Shall fynde it trewe, and veritable Written by fathers, honorable For a more concordant of Godly fame Our Churches at this day, bereth their name Loke vp your stories, and sentence olde Accomptyng the tyme, yeares and season I dare affyrme, Beyng so bolde To make herein, a comparison With any Christen religion For lengthe of time, bearyng good name Concernyng our fayth, for any infame A thousand .CCC. fowre score &amp; twayne Sithen it floryshed, fyrst with vs In the time of many a proude Romayne Martered was holy Euleuterius In whose tyme raigned Lucius In Britaigne, the famous region Then entered forth Christes religion This was in the yere of our Lorde An hundred six and fiftye playne After his byrthe, stories doth accord Sithin the faythe, came fyrst into Britaygne Among vs Brutes there to remayne As at this day, ye may well see Neuer accused, of Infidelite What place so constant, sure and stable As at that tyme, myght there be founde Like vnto Wales, none so veritable No tiranny with vs, there did abounde The Faith remayned, full hole and sounde Accordyng to Christes religion Without spot or gall, of infection. To what place shuld they haue resorted To haue had redresse, in this misery Or where shuld they haue ben supported Nether in Rome, neither in Italy Nether in Spaine, Fraunce, or Germany Brefely to conclude, this is manifest From the sonne risyng, doune to the Weste. Such tirantes that time had the gouerna?ce That no man durste Christ to confesse Dispysed his lawes, and in that instaunce In .xxx. daies, as Scripture doth witnesse Dioclecian MaximianTwenty thousand slayne this is doutlesse By Dioclesian, raigning in the Easte And Maximinian, downe in the west. Who euer harde, of suche a sorte So vngracious, and so vntrewe As were the Romaynes, in their report To blaspheme our Lord, Christ Iesu Affirmyng plaine, this to be trewe That Rome neuer ioyousely prospered Sithin the faith, among them entered Loke in the time, of Arcadius There may ye se, their false opinion [illeg.]Beyng Emperour, with Honorius Unto their Idolles hauyng affection As sainct Austine, maketh relacion In his boke called Ciuitate Dei Where he confoundeth, their false Heresy. My hand quaketh, for fere and drede My heart of truthe, beginneth to shrinke When I beholde, this story to rede The teares weate, distilleth my incke Oh Lorde, to remember and thincke The crueltie, mischefe, and endles paine Among the Romains, that time did raigne Who shuld but morne, lament and wepe Consideryng all thynges of ryghte The vertuous with grace then replete Put in exile, cleane out of syght The tirauntes great, by force of myght Persecuted the innocent bloudde Thus with the Romains, that time it stode. To brefe my sentence, the truthe to tel With vs in Wales, none were opprest No tirauntes great, with vs did dwelle There was the place, of peace and rest Christ and his lawes, for to degest None durst approche, that to deny Agayne our faithe, once to reply. How may ye then, with vs compare Or why do ye, Welshmen defame Let your owne stories, the truthe declare Ye are defectiue, euen in the same As in reproche, worthy of blame Innocentes, gyltlesse to accuse In that your selfe, most dothe abuse. Of your nobles, and Emperours all With Constantine, make no comparison For his magnificence Imperiall Borne in Britaygn, that famous region He was the fyrste, of hearty affection That dyd decree, al men to dye Christ and his lawes that wolde denye. Unto the Churche, for Christes sake Excelled all other, before his time The Romayne Temples, newely did make Dedicated them by sentence deuine To the honor of God, and the orders nyne With most mere and pure deuocion Gaue to the Church, the fyrst possession To that intent, from all indigence The ministers, shuld stande at reste God for to serue, with due reuerence All worldly thoughtes to be represt Uertue to increace, this is manifest All solitary, there for to abyde For the loue of Chryst, this did he prouide. Gaue goodes &amp; treasure with ornam?ts large Amplifyde all thynges, with great expence Made a decree, and gaue in charge That all men shuld, with due reuerence To Christes crosse, kepe his obedience And was the fyrst, in Banner and Shylde Crosses to peynt, that bare in felde. Oh most famous Constantine To whom no Romayne might attayne Whose goodnesse the worlde did inlumine Borne in England, then called Brytaygne Sonne of S. Helin, the story is playne From Troy linially, downe discended In Christes Churche, most to be comm?ded. But nowe a lacke, all is reuersed Onely through fayned perfection For doubtles, vertue was repressed When Constantine, first of affection To Peters Churche, gaue such possession Then obedience, beganne to rebell Whiche caused pride, Humilitee to expell O Rome Rome, ch?ge thi soil, remoue thy place The bishop of Rome Barr? &amp; bare, fruteles is thy gro?d Yet vnto this day, for lacke of grace Littell vertue, in the there doth abound I dare alledge, this world so rounde May not suffyce, this present houre So satisfye thy head and gouernoure The cruell Emperours, by force of warre Myght neuer suche ryches attayne Kingdomes to spoile, countreis to marre As at this time the cause is playne With so smal trauayl, and so great gayne Suche Policie there is inuented By seale and wax, and parchment indented Solles for to saue, ded gone and past But God alone no wight can tell Whether they be free, or in payne caste In Paradice, Heauen, or in Hell Yet for money, those solles wil they sell By auctoritee of Peter and Paule Pardon forgeue, and release them all Thus Lord thy might, thei wold w?draw To whom mercy, onely doth appertaigne As though they might, in heuen make a lawe At their pleasure, solles to detayne Some to release, and some to remayne Like as they wolde, for mede or hyre Some to acquite, some leaue in the fire. Oh Lorde aboue, a damnable offence Among thy people, suche erroures to bryng [illeg.]Against all trewthe, and godly reuerence To haue a trust, in any other thyng There is no helpe, no other meanyng Let this in our heartes, fast be graued Onely by Christes blud, our solles ar saued. And yet (O Lord) how farre do they erre Thy maiesty is all full of mercy No sinner doutles, wilt thou debarre Being penitent, contrite and sory These couetous heades, cleane contrary The poore solle, wrapped in woo and payne Without money, shal lie still and complaine. What Charitee herein is extended When two solles in paine, lieth together Perchance both in one case haue offended The one for money, his ioye shall recouer The other for lacke, shal lye styll for euer Suche is their Charitee, in time of nede Their wordly pompe, to set forth and fede. If cruell Nero, had now a frende That would disbource, and paie at large So to compounde, and make an ende For all his synnes, and fell outrage I thinke his solle, might walke at large Consideryng perdons, are so plentie By meane wherof, hel is emptie. Oh Lorde God, what wondrefull pride Is it on yearth, goddes to be called Equall with thy grace, solles to deuide As though thei wer, in heuen stalled Thy enemies Lorde, thei maie be called Whiche will thy people, suche errors bryng For their profite, our solles deceiuyng Is there any other, maner of meane Then in the bloud, of Christ Iesus The immuculate l?be, moste pure and cleane The sonne of God, whiche doth forgeue vs If we knowledge, our deedes vicius Christ it is, that geueth remission By the mercie, of his blessed passion. The Apostle blessed sainct Peter Nether yet inspired holy sainct Paull The very trewe, and sincere preacher Euer pardoned any solle at all The spirite once past, the body mortall That onely to God, reserued is His deuine power, consisteth in this. O glorius God, how muche are we bo?d Unto thy deuine maiestie These errors greate for to confounde Auoydyng the danger, of this infirmitie In the tyme of our necessite Like as sometyme, surely it befell Unto thy electe, of Israell. Whiche so tenderly, hast cared for vs That nothing mought be, for our saluacion But by thy pitie, moste glorious Thou hast of thy godly affeccion Prepared the same, for our redempcion As in the olde lawe, apereth full well By Iosia, then kyng of Israell. For when thy lawes, wer clene suppressed By the space of many hundred yeres By Iosia again wer redressed Dedicated to thy heuenly speres Abholished their frounyng cheres In worshippyng their false Idolatry Thy glorious name, newly to magnify. By reason wherof, this prince deserued A name of renowne, to hym most excellent By thy grace Lorde, onely reserued Whiche to his name, shalbe permanent Neuer none to hym, equiuolent Reignyng as kyng ouer Israell Lorde vnto thee, this is knowen right well So in likewise, moste mercifull Lorde This present houre, of thy tender loue Thy olde mercie, newly to recorde Our princes herte, inwardly doth moue Suche abusions, to reiecte and reproue Thy lawes, Lorde, long out of remembr?ce Are now reduced, to thy godly ordinance, By our moste noble, Henry theight Through thy incomperable goodnesse All thynges Lorde, is made pure and streight Abholished is all wickednesse In especiall Lorde, this is doubtlesse The power of Rome, so long misused Our kyng hath now vtterly confused. Now to returne, where I began So to conclude, and briefe my stile Betwene the Brute, and the Roman No termes to seke, my tong to fyle No matter more, now to compile The tyme to tracte, do I intende But close vp my boke, and make an ende, But first to you, master Polidorus Your conscience, onely to discharge Whiche of long tyme, hath been obliuious Against vs Brutes, in writyng so large Your spirites incensed, all in a rage By your yeporte, vs to infame Your pen to rashe, your termes out of frame Where is become, your bounden deutie Our antecessours, this to deface Sithe it pleaseth, the high Maiestie Of our moste noble, the kynges good grace. Not to disdaine, as in this case To be compted, of the same stocke and lyne Doune by dissent, to this present tyme. Who wer more worthy, then wer these three Hercules, Hector, and Arthur the kyng For their princely Magnanimitee Was neuer none, to them resemblyng In bodely strength, all other surmountyng Lions, Dragons, monsterous and wild By manly c?straint, made them tame &amp; milde These princely men, these worthies thre Whose knightly force, for to preferre Poetes do fayne, a singularitee For their manhode, and strength in warre Should be transformed, into a starre As it wer, by a deuine grace In the Cristall sky, to take their place, To bryng you, from all ambiguitie Unto the truth, of this succession By a dissente, and a genelogie Without any vain, ostentacion I purpose with an honest emulacion Here to conclude, who so list to loke Set together, at the ende of my boke. But yet because, I haue expressed As heretofore, somewhat al large Our old abuses, newly redressed Perchance ye will ley, theim to my charge Saiyng therin, ye haue aduantage So that we cannot, the thyng deny But with the Prophete, to saie peccaui. We do confesse, our simplicite Like as it was, in tyme of Israell To liue with milke, yerbes and hony For greate excesse, we take no trauell Nether for pompe, or riche apparell We Welshemen plaine, that do deny Whiche is oft, muche vsed in Italie. But as Dauid, with grace replete In tyme of Saull, the famous kyng Disdained not, his shepe to kepe Aboute the feldes, them pastoryng Likewise do we, our selfes conferryng Disdaine not, herdmen to be Whiche is aparte, of our ciuilite. We vse no figges, in pees potage or meat Which in Italy, is oft frequented Without suspecte, together we eate No poysons with vs, is there inuented And ye again contrary incensed With poyson strong, this is insubstance The greater estate, the lesse of assurance. Withdrawe your pen, Master Polidorus Your vain reporte, and fliyng fantasy Your termes grose, and matter slanderus No more in this, to amplify But what maie stande, with honesty Wordes of defame, ye maie well thinke Men will requite, euen to the pittes brinke Herin to make, a degression After the mynde, of Iosephus In the yeres, and computacion Betwene noble Brute, and Romulus And of their citees, stately and sumpteous Which of th? twaine, should other surmo?t Of antiquitee, their yeres to accompt. Also their stocke, birthe, and their lyne As Eusebius, and also sainct Bede Plainly doth define and determyne Brute to bee, moste auncient in dede Foure hundred and twenty yeres as I rede So that London, was a citee of fame When Rome, nor Romulus beare no name. Loke vp your stories, and marke th? well When Brute began, his foundacion Ely was Iudge, and prieste in Israell Nexte insuyng, after Samson As holy scripture, maketh mencion Whiche was before Christ, M.C.xxii. yere As in the stories, more plainly doth apere And thus Eusebius, also sainct Bede Affirmeth plain, in euery thyng How Rome was made, the iiii. yere in dede Of Acham that tyme, of Italy kyng Whiche doth agre, the yeres accomptyng That Lond? before Rome, was raised first Foure hundred and twenty yeres iust.

From Cadwalader, the yere accomptyng As diuerse auctours, doth specify Untill this tyme, doune dissendyng Till our moste noble, theight kyng Henry Of the same stocke, lyne and progeny As by dissent, the yeres doth appere Fully eight hundred fiftie and eight yere. Then to accompt, the yeres &amp; the numbre Sithen Brute, toke his first possession Equally deuide, them asunder Recordyng to the computacion And ye shall finde, by plain discription Two thousand sixe h?dred .lxvi. yeres plain Sithin Brute began, the yere of his reigne Thus for yeres, tyme and continuaunce For bloud, birthe, and high parentage For nobilitee, and mightie puissaunce For vigoure, strength, and manfull corage Let vs compare, with Rome and Cartage With all other, notable citees For our renoumed, olde antiquitees. What should I more, of this report Sithe stories olde, doth it renewe Whose list therto, hymself resorte As I haue saied, shall finde it trewe Set out at large, as it is dewe Honor reuerence, with all other thynges As doth appertayne, to worthy kynges.
