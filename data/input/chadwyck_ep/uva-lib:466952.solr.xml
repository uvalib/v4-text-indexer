      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I THE MINSTREL OR THE PROGRESS OF GENIUS (IN CONTINUATION OF BEATTIE) BOOK III. I Awful the hand of Fate, whose ruthless power With bitterest pangs the human heart can rend; Most awful at that sadly solemn hour, When, o'er the bed of a departing friend, Speechless, in agonizing grief we bend, Observe the quivering lip, the languid eye, And throbbing breast, which the last groans distend; Wipe the cold dew, and catch the parting sigh That wafts the immortal soul into eternity. II But why o'er dying Virtue do we weep? Does the free spirit share our life's decay, (Lost in the gloom of everlasting sleep) Or wait the dawning of a better day? Tho' fearful be the solitary way From this perplext and feverish mortal clime, Yet, cheer'd by Faith, and Hope's celestial ray, Soon shall our wanderings cease in realms where Time And Chance and Change no more shall blast our deathless prime. III Tho' all day long the fast descending rain Have bathed in tears the lovely landscape round, While the sad woods were silent, and the plain No more reechoed every rural sound, The tempest knows its heaven-appointed bound, Sunshine again may cheer the evening's close, And Nature's form be with fresh beauty crown'd; When the swoln stream that from the mountain flows, Will, with its distant roar, but soothe us to repose. IV So I, erewhile whose unavailing woe Deplored the best of friends for ever fled, Now bid those idle sorrows cease to flow, While, by strong Faith to happier regions led, I hold imagined converse with the dead; And if my brow be sometimes overcast, Or if mine eye a tear unbidden shed, It flows from memory of affections past, Mixt with a sigh for those which shall for ever last. V For, tho' a stern philosophy reprove The tender tribute on the grave bestow'd, Whoe'er has felt the sacred flame of love, Whose animated heart has ever glow'd With sense of Nature's charms, or Nature's God, Knows well the soothing power of Melancholy, By whose mild guidance led, the rude abode I pleased forsook of Ignorance and Folly, And consolation found in solitude most holy. VI Thou too, whose strains my bitter cares allay'd, First-born of Heaven, celestial Music, hail! For, well I ween, thy visionary aid Can sweetly soothe, when strength and reason fail, The ills that this distracted life assail; Our miseries can charm, our toils repay; Can guide our progress through the dreary vale, Break with a gleam of light the o'erclouded day, And bid the storms of grief in zephyrs die away. VII Guided by thee, thro' woods whose hollow sound Responsive murmur'd to thy plaintive strain, Or 'mid dark-cavern'd rocks with ivy crown'd Where Echo still possess'd her ancient reign, Or where the gray stream glided through the plain, How oft his steps the young enthusiast bent, To wander free o'er Fancy's airy reign, Or “ruin'd man and virtue lost” lament: For yet no nearer cares his simple heart had rent. VIII But ah! too soon the waves of sorrow roll In gloomy turbulence around, and pour Their gather'd forces on his yielding soul. His native vale (abode of joy before) Reechoes to the song of health no more. The pale destruction hovers o'er his sire; Whose gentle spirit, while it pants to soar, His breast no longer glows with vital fire, His boasted vigour fails, his mental powers expire. IX No more, upon the mountain's craggy steep, His flocks bleat, answering the well-known horn; On the wild cliff that overhangs the deep, No more he hails the glad approach of morn; No more, as eve on dusky pinions borne, Recalls his fleecy wanderers to their fold, His tender Phœbe welcomes his return, Nor on the hearth the blazing fagots roll'd Drive from his hardy limbs the nipping winter's cold. X In yain his Edwin's pious cares relieve By one last gleam of joy his closing day; In vain his friends around in silence grieve, Moistening with tears of love his senseless clay: But yesternight, in robes of shadowy gray, Moved o'er the heath the slow funereal train (Mark'd by prophetic sight) in long array; The torch of death glared horrid on the plain, And streaks of bloody red illumed the swelling main. XI For when, in days where memory loves to dwell, Dark Superstition o'er the nations spread Her fearful banner, every lonely dell, And glade that human footsteps seldom tread, And pathless heath, and storm-beat mountain's head, Became the imagined haunt of witch or sprite, Or peopled by the spectres of the dead Who walk'd the melancholy round of night, Till to their graves dispersed by the fresh morning's light. XII E'en now, when Reason, like the lovely dawn, Has chased those strange fantastic dreams away, Far in the bleak ungenial North withdrawn The tyrant holds her solitary sway: But ah! unhappy thou, her destined prey, Whom ardent fancy hurried to the snare! For thee shall joyless pass the summer day, And, when dark winter hurtles in the air, Thy life shall be a blank of comfortless despair. XIII At length when, heated by the wizard fire, The extravagant and erring spirit glows Uncheck'd within; and baleful fiends inspire (Last curse of Heaven) the sense of future woes; When every wave that roars and wind that blows Comes charged with prescience of impending fate; How will thy soul, in agonizing throes, Strive to shake off the hated gift too late, And sink again, oppress'd with more than mortal weight! XIV Edwin, whose mind the Hermit's pious lore Had clear'd from error's stain and thoughts untrue, Yet strong imagination often bore Beyond the limits that his reason drew. How vain the dreams of ignorance he knew, Yet trembled at the voice he scorn'd to fear: His sense revolted from the hideous crew Of phantoms imaged by the gifted seer; Yet each new portent fell like death upon his ear. XV Beneath an oak whose antique branches shade A bank with moss and fragrant flowers o'ergrown, Low in the earth the hoary sire is laid, The place unmark'd by fence or sculptured stone; No angels there in polish'd marble moan, Nor pompous epitaph bespeaks his worth; For such befit the proud and great alone Who boast their hoarded wealth or noble birth, Kings, statesmen, conquerors, and tyrants of the earth. XVI Not so the shepherd: near the rising ground Where low at peace his mouldering bones were laid, A rustic cross was fix'd, and, all around, Fresh flowers were strown, and verdant holly made About the sacred spot a grateful shade. In a lone dell o'ergrown with tangled wood These last sad obsequies his Edwin paid, Where never foot profane had dared intrude, Nor sound of mirth disturb'd the silent solitude. XVII Thither the melancholy youth would hie, Oft as the sun's last ray illumed the plain, And watch the spot the whole night long, and sigh, Till sank the morning-planet in the main: At length his long-forsaken lyre again Becomes the gentle solace of his care; Again he wakes the sweetly solemn strain, The listening woods again his wild notes bear To the lone echoing hills, and waft along the air. XVIII “O shades beloved!” (thus flow'd his plaintive song) “Where he I weep in vain was wont to stray, When your rude rocks and wizard streams among I with him plied, untired, the toilsome day, Where now is he whose presence cheer'd the way, Whose eyes beam'd gladness o'er the blest abode? That form revered is now unfeeling clay, Silent that tongue whence mild instruction flow'd, And cold the generous breast where love and pity glow'd. XIX “Yet still the immortal spirit lives and moves: Perhaps, beyond this dark terrestrial bourn, Sometimes the memory of departed loves May upward to the heaven of heavens be borne, And guide him to the once beloved sojourn, His favourite haunts, in life so sweet and fair, Where, in the company of those who mourn, Unseen he oft may hover in the air, Join in the choral hymn, or aid the fervent prayer.” XX And now sweet sleep his weary eyelids press'd, As stretch'd he lay the flowery grave beside; No hideous dreams disturb his balmy rest; But o'er his head strange music seems to glide, Mix'd with the murmurs of the distant tide; Such strains as might to heaven itself aspire, Purer than aught to earthly sounds allied, Wild as the breathings of the Æolian lyre, Full as the organ's swell, and loud responsive choir. XXI Raptured he cast around his wondering sight, And saw, far stretching o'er the Atlantic main, An airy cloud, with silver radiance bright, Which half involved the spangled azure plain: There, clad in robes of mist, a shadowy train Of spirits seem'd their nightly watch to keep; There stood the honour'd chief, the humble swain, And there the hoary Bard appear'd to sweep His harp, whose solemn notes soft floated o'er the deep. XXII “O'er him whose fate, O pious youth! you grieve, No longer mourn,” aerial voices cried. “That he yet lives, and lives most blest, believe, And that, no more to earthly dross allied, His pure celestial soul is still thy guide.” He gazed, and saw enthroned among the rest His much-loved sire: and now the ocean-tide Was in the morning's loveliest colours drest, And all the vision died into the kindling West. XXIII Edwin awoke. Light, cheerful, and serene, He felt at once from all his woe released, And saw, unclouded, the surrounding scene. Tho' tasteless long Creation's noblest feast, Tho' long the joyous woodland song had ceased, The groves were tuned anew to harmony; Again the day-star blazing in the East, With no dark vapours clouded, deck'd the sky; All nature's charms again lay open to his eye. XXIV Oh, could I aught of that celestial flame Acquire, which fired the Faerie Minstrel's breast, How small would be on Fortune's gifts my claim, Of Nature's stores and Nature's love possest! He whom the Muse has favour'd is most blest: For him the forest spreads a broader shield; The shades of summer give securer rest; The beauteous vales a livelier verdure yield; And purer flows the stream, and fairer smiles the field. XXV He envies not the rich imperial board, Or downy couch for pamper'd Luxury spread: The simple feast that woods and fields afford, The canopy of trees, the natural bed Of moss by murmuring streams perennial fed, In him more genuine heart's content excite: The dazzling rays by brightest diamonds shed Yield to the fairer glories of the night, That circle round his head in order infinite. XXVI Such were thy joys, sweet Bard, when stretch'd along By Mulla's fountain-head thy limbs reclined, Where Fancy, parent of enchanted song, Pour'd the full tide of Poesy, refined From stain of earthly dross, upon thy mind. Thine was the holy dream when, pure and free, Imagination left the world behind “In that delightful land of Faerie” Alone to wander, rapt in heavenly minstrelsy. XXVII Oh who, so dull of sense, in heart so lost To Nature's charms and every pure delight, Would rather lie, on the wild billows tost Of vain Ambition, with eternal night Surrounded, and obscured his mental sight By mists of Avarice, Passion, and Deceit? Not he whose spirit clear, whose genius bright, The Muse has ever led, in converse sweet, Within the hallow'd glades of her divine retreat. XXVIII Not Edwin—in whose infant breast, I ween, From childish cares and little passions free, Tho' long in shades retired, unmark'd, unseen, Had blown the fairest flower of Poesy. That lovely promise of a vigorous tree Instructed Genius found: each straggling shoot He wisely pruned of its wild liberty, Turn'd the rich streams of Science round the root, And view'd with warm delight the fair and grateful fruit. XXIX The animating tales of former days, 'Wakening the patriot's warm heroic fire; The strains of old traditionary praise, That bid the soul to noblest deeds aspire; All swell'd the raptures of his kindling lyre: His native vales resounded with the song, And rustic bosoms glow'd with new desire To raise the oppress'd, to quell the proud and strong, And in the poet's lays their glorious names prolong. XXX Nor chain'd for ever to unbending truth Did Edwin's active spirit deign to dwell, But oft, transported by the fire of youth, Was borne away to Fancy's airy cell. Then would his harp more rapturously swell, And all that's great, or beautiful, or wild Awake his soul to joys that none can tell But he on whom the power of Song has smiled, Nature's inspired priest, Imagination's child. XXXI Oft, at the close of eve, assembled round The youthful minstrel village groups were seen, Regardless of the distant tabor's sound And peals of noisy mirth that burst between; While, in some glen remote or shelter'd green, He sang the strains his brethren loved to hear; Full to their view he brought each fabled scene Of war or peace, the banquet or the bier, And hardy deeds of arms, and sorceries dark and drear: XXXII Of Fingal, victor in the bloody field O'er prostrate tribes of Erin's faithless coast; Or dreadful blazing with his sun-like shield, An angry meteor thro' the affrighted host; Or, half beheld and half in shadows lost, Sailing in mist above the towering head Of some gigantic hill with clouds emboss'd, Encircled by the spirits of the dead, Who walk the moonlight maze, or in the tempest tread: XXXIII Of Morna, looking for her lord's return, Her lovely hunter, who returns no more; Of Loda's vengeful spirit, dark and stern, Haunting the wizard rocks of Inistore: But Edwin's soul was never known to pour So sweet, so sadly musical, a strain, As when, deep pondering on the deeds of yore, He seem'd with mournful Ossian to complain, The last of all his race, alone on Morven's plain. XXXIV By Fancy's sweet but strong attraction caught, The swains delighted hung upon his lays; Nor ceased to listen when their Edwin taught With graver minstrelsy the wondrous ways Of Nature, or ascended to the praise Of that Almighty Power who sits on high, Who mark'd the eternal course of circling days, Who made, from nothing, Man, and fix'd his eye Full on the empyreal heaven, and bad him read the sky. XXXV Yet not at once could Edwin's mystic lore Complete the wonders by his lays begun: “What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore, The Muse herself for her enchanted son?” Not till maturing years had slowly run Their destined course, coæval with the strain, Could the whole animating task be done. Then universal music fill'd the plain, While listening oaks and rocks obey'd the mighty swain. XXXVI And now the “subtle thief of youth” has borne Whole years of life away on silent wing, Mingling the riper grace by summer worn With the fair bloom of Edwin's vigorous spring. Now o'er his tuneful harp's responsive string With nervous firmness sweeps his manly hand; Years o'er his cheek their mellowing shadows fling; His modest grandeur and demeanor bland Bespeak him form'd alike for love and high command. VII Unpractised in the chase, untaught to know The rustic sports his fellow-swains pursued, His powerful arm ne'er bent the twanging bow, Nor dipp'd the knotty spear in savage blood; His dextrous feet stemm'd not the eddying flood, Nor scaled the lofty precipice whene'er The echoing horn from distant glen or wood Call'd round the wandering huntsmen to the lair Where lay some noble beast unconscious of the snare. XXXVIII Yet was his frame to early toil enured, His noble soul in fears and dangers tried; Hunger, and thirst, and watchings, he endured, The fearful turbulence of storms defied; And, as advancing manhood's lofty pride Mark'd with determined lines his sun-burnt face, His sinewy limbs, firm grasp, and active stride, Raised him, in deeds of strength and matchless grace, Above his rude compeers, the heroes of the chase. XXXIX Nor yet, tho' Edwin's noble spirit glow'd, With every generous wish and feeling fraught, Had Hope survey'd Ambition's wider road, Or love of fame his young idea caught. Still home was ever nearest to his thought, His native mountains, his paternal shed: Or, worlds untried if fancy ever sought, His sage instructor's words again he read, “Ambition's slippery verge oh why should mortals tread?” XL And tho' for love his warm and feeling breast Full surely was by Heaven itself design'd, That heavenly love, the noblest and the best, That seeks the union of a kindred mind; The fairest virgin yet had fail'd to bind His gentle soul, or amorous thoughts impart. Constant in friendship, generous, just, and kind, With him who sought, he shared a brother's part, But still preserved untouch'd the freedom of his heart. XLI Soothed by the magic of his earliest song, The infant Malcolm had his steps pursued, Oft as by haunted springs he lay along, Or in the deep recesses of the wood; And, ever as the sun his course renew'd, Closer and closer still the knot he drew, Alike the sharer of each various mood When the whole world assumed its gayest hue, Or her dark veil o'er all black Melancholy threw. XLII Yet many a moment of the live-long day (But chief what time descend the evening dews) Nor village converse, nor the pleasing lay Of his loved friend, could aught of joy diffuse: Oft at that solemn hour would Edwin choose, All lonely, to the sea-beat shore to go, Holding celestial converse with the Muse, Who to her genuine sons alone will show The ways of Heaven above, the path of life below. XLIII 'Twas on a night most suited to his soul, Silent and dark, save when the moon appear'd Thro' shadowy clouds at intervals to roll, And half the scene with partial lustre clear'd; Save that the stillness of the air was cheer'd By waters pouring from the heights above; Save that by fits the ocean's voice was heard, With sudden gusts of wind that stirr'd the grove, And rose and fell again like tender sighs of love. XLIV Soothed by the scene, he traced the straggling course Of a small stream, which, from the distant steep Of hills descending, pour'd its rocky force, With many an eddying whirl and foamy leap, Through a dark narrow valley, to the deep. Shunn'd was the dell by every earthly wight, Where ghosts and wicked elves were said to keep: True 'twas a haunted spot; for Edwin's sprite Oft loved to linger there, and there the Muse invite. XLV But wider did this gloomy vale expand, As nearer roar'd the ocean's awful sound; Till, sudden opening on the sea-beat strand, The unbounded main appear'd; and, wide around, An amphitheatre of granite, crown'd With mountains piled on mountains to the sky. And now the moon had reach'd her western bound, When the long shades extending from on high Veil'd half the face of things in deep obscurity. XLVI A feeble ray, still rescued from the dark, The furthest eastern billows glimmer'd o'er, Illumining a distant bounding bark, That drove with swelling sails the wind before: The Minstrel mark'd the course that vessel bore, And watch'd, until the breeze had shaped its way To where, beyond a northern point, the shore Narrow'd into a safe and quiet bay, Hard by the woody glen in which the hamlet lay. XLVII That distant point the Minstrel also gain'd As night withdrew her veil of sable lawn; Just when the sky with earliest light was stain'd, And ocean's distant outline faintly drawn By the uncertain pencil of the dawn. And now the vessel safely moor'd he view'd, And, at a distance from the shore withdrawn, Two men of warlike port, and aspect rude, Who lay apart reclined in sad and thoughtful mood. XLVIII The warlike helmet shadow'd o'er each face, Frowning with sable plumes in gloomy pride; The spear, alike for battle and the chase Before them lay; and naked at their side The broad claymore with leathern thongs was tied; Thro' the thick cloak that wrapp'd their limbs in shade, The burnish'd cuirass, which it seem'd to hide In its capacious folds, was half display'd, Mark'd with the deep indent of many a hostile blade. XLIX Fired with the sudden sight, so new and strange, A momentary flash of glad surprise Kindled in Edwin's cheeks a glowing change: Onward he press'd, and ever fix'd his eyes On one, the first in noble port and size, Of the mysterious strangers; and, as near His footsteps drew, he saw the warrior rise, As if the approaching sound had struck his ear— But Edwin's generous soul was ignorant of fear. L Stern was the warrior's brow—his eye of fire Temper'd by Melancholy's chastening hand; His looks at once might awe and love inspire, Inexorably firm, sublimely grand, Yet mingling soft persuasion with command; Furrow'd his front with sorrows, toils and cares, Like some lone exile's in an unknown land; His grisly beard and thinly scatter'd hairs Proclaim'd him somewhat sunk into the vale of years. LI “Peasant,” he said, “if aught of human woes “E'er melt the natives of this lonely place, “Here let our tempest-beaten bark repose “From Fate's unpitying storms a little space! “Used are we to hard fare—the perilous chase “Hath yielded, day and night, our doubtful food: “Tho' from the South we come, our hardy race “Can boast the untainted channel of their blood, “Flowing from sire to son in no degenerate flood. LII “Nor had we wander'd from our quiet home, “The much-loved hamlet where our fathers lie; “But fell Ambition, ever wont to roam, “Left her own fruitful plains and sunny sky “To rob us of our cherish'd liberty. “Detested king! what mighty prize is thine, “That haughty England lifts her head so high? “A barren rock encircled by the brine, “Stain'd with the streaming blood of thousands of thy line. LIII “But while I speak, perchance my life is sold, “And Edward's spies hang eager o'er their prey; “Perchance my narrow sum of days is told, “And night already closes round my way. “If thus, I am prepared, nor wish to stay “The heavy hand of death, however near. “Are then these deserts free, O stranger, say? “'Twill gild with joy my parting hour to hear “That yet a Scot survives unawed by Edward's spear,” LIV “Yet free,” the youth replied, “from blood and crimes, “From the rude tyranny of foreign powers, “And ‘all the misery of these iron times,’ “Our peaceful shepherds pass their harmless hours; “Nor battle rages, nor the sword devours: “Not e'en the distant sound of war's alarms “Has ever reach'd these calm sequester'd bowers; “But the old Minstrel's song of knights and arms “Seems like some fairy-tale that by its wonders charms. LV “The constant practice of the chase affords “A feeble mimicry of war alone; “And to our rudely taught but free-born hordes “The Name of Liberty is scarcely known, “Altho' her real Substance is our own. “Yet, strong and zealous to defend our right, “If tyrant-force in our loved vale were shown, “Soon should we, equal to the best in fight, “Assert fair Freedom's cause, and prove our native might. LVI “But tho' from our rude mountain's rocky side “The blast of distant war rolls off unheard, “Yet are we not to savage beasts allied, “Nor slow to pity woes we never fear'd: “All human-kind is to our souls endear'd; “The wretched to our special care belong: “But, most of all, if their bold arms they rear'd “In Virtue's cause against tyrannic wrong, “Still unsubdued in soul, unconquerably strong.” LVII The warrior-chief on Edwin while he spoke Fix'd his firm eye, and long deep-musing sate; Then, rising, thus the awful silence broke: “Youth, I accept thy love, thy guidance wait; “Enough for me, if Edward's lawless hate “Hath left this little nook of Scotland free. “Enough for thee, that I'm the sport of Fate, “Driven from my home, a wanderer on the sea, “And all for ardent love of sacred Liberty!” BOOK IV. Not before published, having been left unfinished. I Farewell the oaten pipe and pastoral song, The vocal woodland, the resounding shore! In the delightful vale of peace too long The muse hath linger'd, destined to explore Far other scenes, and bolder heights to soar. How soon, with weary pilgrimage o'erspent, She may retrace her early haunts once more, I stay not to discover—lowly bent With my best powers to serve her sovereign intent. II Of arms and loves, gay youth and warlike pride, Of courteous deeds, of tilts and trophies hung, Those ancient bards who Fancy made their guide In sage and solemn minstrelsy have sung. Them now I follow, and with faltering tongue Would tune anew the rude poetic lays Wherewith old Scotia's mountains whilom rung, When hoary chiefs sat listening to the praise Of their own mighty deeds, achiev'd in earlier days. III Oh would the genius of that hallow'd time But deign to smile on this degenerate day, And animate my all too feeble rhyme, More boldly would I speed the soaring lay, And cast distrust and chilling doubt away. So may the love of sacred Liberty Direct my rude and perilous essay, And set my soul from servile fetters free, Curbing the native flight of Heaven-born Poesy! IV Thrice had the moon decay'd, and thrice renew'd Her horn, while yet those wandering strangers stay'd, Charm'd with the simple life the swains pursued, And the rude virtues of that sylvan glade. Oft in the chase their vigorous frames display'd All knightly gests of valour, strength and speed; And oft at eve their friendly hosts they paid With kindling tales of many a generous deed, Of fierce invaders quell'd, and Caledonia freed. V The rustic herd, whose lives in thoughtless ease And toil alternate, unregarded flow, Listen'd the unwonted strains, which idly please, Like children wondering at some passing shew; But more they neither guess, nor wish to know. Not so the minstrel, in whose nobler breast Swell new desires, and unknown passions glow, Whose soul no pleasure knows, whose frame no rest, Rapt ever in himself, of his own thoughts possest. VI To his enchanted senses now no more The changing scenes of nature yield delight, And every charm, so exquisite before, Dies unobserved upon his vacant sight: Lost to all joy, save when the solemn night Holds o'er a peaceful world unbroken sway; Then oft in converse with that elder knight, Free and regardless, would he while away The swiftly passing hours, and chide returning day. VII And mutual was the charm that bound each soul. If from the warrior's tongue persuasion flow, If, while he speaks, his eyes indignant roll In virtuous transport, or dissolve in woe, No less in Edwin's beaming face, where glow His heart's best energies, pure, lofty, free, Rekindling hopes engender'd long ago, The Chief might still some fleeting vision see Of happier days to come, and rescued Liberty. VIII The fate of Wallace, Scotia's pride and boast, The daring champion of her injured right, Who stemm'd the tide of Edward's conquering host, Proving in Freedom's cause his native might, Became the sacred theme of every night: The tale, tho' oft repeated, never tired; While thro' the toils of many a glorious fight, Edwin, with all a patriot's zeal inspired, Track'd his bright course, and burn'd to be what he admired. IX But soon the tale inclined to sadder mood, Painting the Hero of his country, lost Among dark glens, and rocks, and caverns rude, Or on wild seas in some frail pinnace tost, Or naked thrown on some deserted coast, Abandon'd by his friends, alone, forlorn, Each fondly cherish'd hope by Fortune crost, His memory proscribed, his honours shorn, And his loved native land condemn'd in blood to mourn. X How in his castle, like a faded rose, Dissolved in tears his lovely Margaret lay, In tears fast flowing for her country's woes, And for an exiled Father far away; While, like some vulture, hovering o'er his prey, With dusky wings darkening the troubled air, Black Douglas bade his ruthless bands display The sanguine flag, and seize the struggling fair, Unmoved by Beauty's charms, and deaf to maiden prayer. Whoso with patient and enquiring mind Would seek the stream of science to ascend, Must count the cost, and never hope to find Rest to his feet, or to his wanderings end. The faithless road doth ever onward tend, And clouds and darkness are its utmost bound: The sacred fount no human eye hath kenn'd, Though many a wight, beguiled by sight or sound, “??????!” may exclaim; “I—I the place have found.” And, sooth to tell, it is a pleasant way Through sweet variety of lawn and wood, Mountain and vale, green pasture, forest gray, And peopled town, and silent solitude; And many a point, at distance dimly view'd, For idle loiterers an unmeasured height, By persevering energy subdued, Rewards the bold adventurer with a sight Of undiscover'd worlds—vast regions of delight. LEGENDS FROM THE “SEVEN CHAMPIONS OF CHRISTENDOM.” LEGEND I. ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON. Now was the season when the gorgeous sun Had doff'd his dark December liverie, And o'er the waving plain and dimpled sea With renovated light resplendent shone. All nature felt his ray, and, rich with showers, Glad in her lap received the opening flowers That Maia strew'd about unsparingly, While thro' the green groves tripp'd it merrily, All fresh with vernal dews the rosy bosom'd hours. From the high rock and mossy forest soar To thank their sovereign sun the tuneful birds, And basking in his beams, the lowing herds Lie on the bank beside the rivulet hoar; Thro' chequer'd woods, to meet the rising morn, Springs the rejoicing lark from every thorn, And sober evening hears the melody Of Philomel in many a lonely tree, That to high Heaven by echo is for ever borne. So nature smiled, as o'er the flowery road, And down the mountain's wild romantic side, And by the banks of wandering rivers wide, And through deep woods, by human feet untrod, An English knight his devious path pursued: While the soft season, in his soul renew'd Sweet fairy visions, and delicious dreams Of friends and country left, bright Phœbus' beams Pour'd down their noontide heat upon the sparkling flood. Like the mild evening of a summer's day Is the remembrance of enjoyment past: The sun is set, but o'er the vale is cast A softer light from his reflected ray. No dazzling radiance strikes the senses blind, No fiery heat fatigues the raptured mind; But calm the spirit as the unruffled sea, Concordant as seraphic harmony, Pure as the soul that longs its native Heaven to find. Enjoyment palls; imagination fades; But memory's pleasures never melt away, And hope's delusive power with stronger sway Our actions rules, and every sense pervades. 'Tis like the rising morn, whose cheerful smile Exalts our souls, and animates our toil. What though in misty shrouds the landscape lies, Creative fancy every scene supplies, Spreads the bright grassy slope, or shapes the shadowy isle. 'Twas smiling hope that led that errant knight Thro' Egypt's perilous wilds and burning sands, To seek the mead of fame in distant lands, Honour's best solace, and supreme delight. 'Twas hope advanced him thro' the rugged road, By many a trial won, to fame's abode. 'Twas heavenly hope exalted o'er the throng, To shine on high, the blessed souls among, Saint George—of Britain's weal the tutelary God. When Phœbus now had reach'd his western goal, And lengthen'd shades obscured the dubious way, Fled from the wanderer's mind those visions gay. Behind, the last ray glimmer'd from the pole; Before him frown'd an unfrequented wood, Whereto his steed uncurb'd its way pursued. Thick was the wood, and as they journey'd on, Deeper and deeper sank the setting sun, Whilst darker grew the shades, and desart longer shew'd. And to this day the knight might still have trod The many mazes of that endless wood, Whilst issuing from old Nilus' slimy flood, Fierce Alligators scream'd along the road, And serpents hiss'd, in every thicket found, And Lions roar'd, and Tigers growl'd around. Such concert for the Champion was prepared, When, thro' the blackening shades as on he fared, A taper's friendly light shot gleaming o'er the ground. Fortune, in truth, had led him to a place Where stood the only mansion of the soil. There, far removed from worldly care and toil, A hermit stay'd, to end his mortal race. Tho' ten long years the sire had ne'er survey'd The face of man who thro' these desarts stray'd, Not with less courtesy he received the knight, Refresh'd with food, and lodged him for the night, And with the morning's dawn, to his lost road convey'd. Midst other converse—“Underneath yon hill,” The old man said, while tears of pity roll'd, “Each year some fair Egyptian maid is sold A hellish serpent's ravenous maw to fill. This savage monster, fifty years ago, Fill'd Egypt's far-extended land with woe, Her harvests blasted, and her sons destroy'd, Till at the last, with spoil and slaughter cloy'd, An annual tribute now will satisfy the foe. “So to avert his all-destroying spite, They choose a virgin every year by lot, Whom bound they leave a victim on the spot, Sad victim to his ravenous appetite. This very day the Soldan's daughter dies, Ah how unfit to be the monster's prize! And twenty youths, the lovely maid to save, Have in this desart met an early grave, Scorch'd by his sulphurous breath, or blasted by his eyes.” “O chosen band!” the admiring champion cried, “Let me pursue your path to deathless fame! Here for myself the bold emprize I claim, And swear to save, or perish by her side.” The hoary sage commends his generous zeal, Blesses his hauberk's mail and gloves of steel, Directs his course, then leaves with tear-swoln eyes. The champion, as the sun made sign to rise, Came where the dragon waits, alone, his annual meal. Red rose the sun above the eastern hill, Mantled in mist, and thro' the troubled air Burst the wild shrieks of horror and despair, That with unwonted awe his bosom fill. Bound to yon stone what sculptured form appears? Down her pale cheek descend no dewy tears, No sighs her bare and marble bosom move, Closed are her lips, for pleasure form'd, and love, No sight her dimmèd eyes receive, no sound her ears. To the cold statue as the knight drew nigh, Feebly she raised her languid lids, and cried, (Till on her lips the unfinish'd accents died,) “Fly, daring youth, from luckless Sabra fly!” —“No, by the God whose holy badge I bear, No, by the King whose knightly sword I wear; None e'er shall English George a caitiff call, Who vows for thee to conquer or to fall.” —He knelt, and on his forehead seal'd the oath he sware. “For thee, bright Virgin, to this fated place I came, nor, without thee, will hence depart: Here will I leave a spotless Christian's heart, Or rend the monster's from its ebon case. Give then thine hand, fair saint! thy Knight am I.” She gave her hand; when lo! before her eye Appear the scaly Monster's sinewy folds: Again she strives to loose the hand he holds; “Fly, generous youth,” she cried, “from luckless Sabra fly!” The Monster now, in many a tortuous spire, Drags his green length of tail along the sand— (Firm stays the knight, nor quits the Virgin's hand.) Flash his red eye-balls, and his nostrils fire— (The Briton bears unmoved his ghastly gaze.) And now his burnish'd scales erected blaze; His iron wings he spreads; and o'er the ground His shadow spreads ten cubits' space around; (Saint George his lance protends, and his broad shield displays.) Sabra no more resists, no more dissuades, No more her eyes their speaking lustres dart To tear the fateful purpose from his heart, But grateful agony each look pervades. Oh with what throbs her heaving bosom beats, As the stout lance the scaly dragon meets! What horror stiffens every joint again, Chains every nerve, and freezes every vein, When shiver'd on the sand, the Knight unarm'd retreats! Loud yell'd the monster, and his sulphurous breath Fill'd with intolerable stench the air. The hot contagion can no mortal bear, But parch'd and wither'd, sinks in putrid death. The flowers are blasted on the smoking ground, The leaves drop blacken'd from the woods around; Stiff in the tainted pools the fishes die; In spiral paths the birds above them fly, In lessening circles whirl'd, till life and sense are drown'd. What pitying power has George and Sabra spared? Ah happy pair! to you shall yet be given Long hours of solace by indulgent Heaven. Yet scarce the fainting knight to breathe was heard, As motionless on his dead horse he lay: Onward the monster roll'd his destined way, His griping talon on his shoulder laid, All the black horrors of his throat display'd, And pour'd the burning venom on his hapless prey. The deadly stream descended on his vest, Where the red cross the pious Champion bore, Dear symbol of his faith. Deadly no more, The life-restoring poison fill'd his breast. O miracle of Grace! the Knight, restored, Leap'd lightly from the ground, and seized his sword; On the fell fury rush'd with ardent zeal— The gaping throat received his trusty steel, And the black heart's blood, mix'd with baleful venom, pour'd. “Rise, Sabra! thou art saved—the dragon dies.” Alas! she answers not—her limbs are cold— Dim mists have closed her eyes—her breath enfold. Again the knight exclaims, “Rise, Lady, rise!” At length like healing balm his accents flow; Again the life blood mounts, the spirits glow; While, on his soft supporting arm reclined, Fann'd by his casque, the brisk refreshing wind Bids on her death-cold cheek returning roses blow. Now on that cheek, where late the pallid hue Unmix'd appear'd of hopeless cold despair, Warm blushes rise, as from his ivory fair Pygmalion's passion warmth and feeling drew. The statue warms—and in the virgin's breast Joy, gratitude, and wonder shine confest. As on the youth who saved her gleam her eyes, With gratitude, and pleasure, and surprise, If love too enters, comes he a forbidden guest? But if the maid such various passions move, On the blest victor's heart what rapture steals, As every moment some new charm reveals, And her eyes sparkle with the flames of love? Lingering and silent they together trace Their path towards the Hermit's holy place: Expressive silence!—words had less display'd The awaken'd fervours of that grateful maid Than did her speaking eyes and love illumined face. Now hast thou loiter'd long enough, my muse! Suffice it then, they love; nor stop to say How joyful was the hermit to survey His late lost guest alive, and hear the news Of that foul dragon stretch'd along the shore, Now terror of Egyptian dames no more; Nor what his hut contain'd, to drink and eat: We know he was not sparing of his meat, And that his mule at length the rescued princess bore. And so for Cairo!—On the banks of Nile I see the amorous pair pursue their way; Bright Sabra, lovely as the dawn of day, Slow pacing on her mule; and, all the while, The British knight, attendant at her side, Along the shore the sluggish palfrey guide, In silence gazing on its beauteous load; Or, to beguile the long, though happy, road, Of knightly deeds converse, and countries distant wide. Here rest, my Hippogryff, some little space— And time, perchance, thy wanderings here were ended; From dreamy realms of Faery-land descended, Ill may'st thou hope to find reward or grace Mid sober sons of sage utility, Who ne'er to fancy bent the stubborn knee, Or own'd the soul-subduing power of song. Then rest awhile—yet not to tarry long, Ere Egypt's sands are changed for verdant Thessaly. LEGEND II. ST. DENIS AND THE MULBERRY TREE. From Nile's hot regions, by the viewless gale Of warm imagination borne along, And the resistless power of wizard song, Turn, gentle muse! to Tempé's flowery vale— Delicious Tempé—where the Thracian bard Of old amid the echoing caves was heard By stones and trees, that, waken'd by his lyre, Felt the soft breathings of poetic fire, And, bounding to the strain, their new-born joys declared. Yet not of Greece or Rome's enchanting lore, The Mantuan flute or Syracusan reed— More barbarous times—an iron age—succeed, And darken all the Muses' favour'd shore. Not now of swains who, with alternate song, Bad Phœbus linger, whilst his journey long He sought to finish at his western gate; While Nymphs applauded, and in rustic state Time-honour'd judges sat the rival bards among. Still rugged Œta lifts his cloudy head, And high Olympus with eternal snows; Still through his valleys pure Enipeus flows, And their old woods o'er Hæmus' cliffs are spread: But Love and Music there no longer dwell; Foul monsters lurk in every savage dell; The clank of arms the sovereign wood-nymphs frights; Wild Fauns sit trembling on their ancient heights, No more secure, and Pan has left his royal cell. Oh yet revisit thy once loved domain, Immortal Muse! and tune the Gothic lyre, And with the breath of wild romance inspire The shores once echoing to a classic strain. Not inharmonious through the pastoral shade Where Thyrsis erst, and Melibœus play'd, Shall sound the lay of arms, and steed, and knight, (Fancy's creation) nor without delight Oh let me in the lap of Faërie be laid! For who, to please a cold, fastidious age, Would lop each wilding shoot that nature gave, Banish the clowns that dig Ophelia's grave, Or chase Lear's simple follower from the stage? Shall yonder tower be of its ivy spoil'd, Or brushwood from the cavern's mouth exiled? Tasteless Reformer!—thy “sublime” and “fair” May form a thesis for the pedant's chair; But thee the Muse ne'er loved, nor Fancy call'd her child. To me more dear are Nature's strangest forms, The rudest structures of the Poet's hand, Than palaces with art Palladian plann'd, Though placed secure from reach of Critic storms. I hail the giant oak's fantastic boughs, The huge misshapen mountain's shaggy brows; Nor less the wanton windings of the brook, The streams that gush from every wayward nook, And, roaring through the vale, far mountain echoes rouse. But chiefly you, great masters of the lyre! Who struck as nature moved, as fancy reign'd; Whom no cold rules of modern art restrain'd But the great Muse herself exalted higher. For one bright hue from Shakspeare's magic loom, For one stray feather cast from Spenser's plume, Say, would I not each courtlier grace resign? —Immortal Muse! Then never more be mine Enjoyment's rapturous trance, or Awe's ecstatic gloom! 'Twas thus, beneath a hawthorn's snowy bower Reclining laid, lull'd by the ceaseless noise Of summer flies, I dream'd of former joys, And felt again the soft poetic power, Long absent; for below the open sky, She dwells, and shuns the confined paths where I Must the sweet season spend, until the days Slow rolling bring me back where Isca strays Thro' my loved native fields, land of my minstrelsy. Nor Isca only wakes my slumbering lyre, Ah no! Love strung it on the banks of Thames: Her image mingles with the noon-tide flames, Whose morning smiles engender'd first the fire. Hers is the spell that sped my tuneful vein; And of her beauties and my love I feign Would only sing; but the great Muse denies: Yet,—wilt thou take the unworthy sacrifice? To thee and Richmond will I dedicate my strain. Again from Thames to old Enipeus borne In Fancy's airy barque, I see a knight Thro' the deep valley ride in armour bright: The fleurs de lys his azure coat adorn; From his proud helm three waving feathers fall; The white cross glitters on his velvet pall: His courteous airs a noble race bespeak; By his sweet tongue ye might have deem'd him Greek; But his embroider'd arms bespeak a knight of Gaul. And who is he, the youth so fresh and fair, With sparkling crest and dancing plumage gay? And on what bold adventure does he stray So far from his loved Seine's maternal care? To exalt in distant regions Gallia's fame, And spread Religion's empery his aim, Long had he lain enslaved to Grammarye; And now but late from Khalyb's spells set free By Britain's Champion bold; and Denis is his name. Ah why has Beauty so confined a date? Why bow the brave to Time's all-conquering power? The violet droops beneath the thunder shower, And lightning rends the Oak's majestic state. So mighty man to Time and Chance must yield; A stranger doom, by history unreveal'd, Untold before in song, must Denis prove, And, ere he win a matchless virgin's love, Roam thro' Thessalian shades a savage of the field. And must that noble front wide antlers bear?— That form, which stands erect, and braves the sky, Descend, and prone on earth's mean bosom lie? That gentle skin be cased in horrid hair? Yes. On Enipeus' banks there stood a tree, From whose rich boughs the tempting mulberry In luscious clusters lured the hungry knight— (Ah luckless hour that e'er they met his sight!—) He rends the loaded branch—the life blood follows free. The warm stream gushing from the wounded plant Not long the knight in silent wonder view'd, Ere a faint shriek sent forth the labouring wood That seem'd thro' every shoot to shrink and pant. At length a female voice pursued the sound, Sweet, though disturb'd and plaintive from the wound. “Tear not my tender flesh!—kind youth, forbear! Ah re-unite the branch with generous care, Nor leave me thus to pour my life out on the ground!” As when some swain, with pleasing cares of love, Tends his bright mistress thro' emboweréd meads, Perchance a straggling rose his path impedes, Or tangled wood-bine pendant from above, Sportive he leaps the tempting flower to tear, To deck her bonnet or entwine her hair; If from the leaves a lurking adder dart, He drops the prize; strange horrors chill his heart, All motionless he stands, nor flies the deadly snare. So stood the knight as from that injured wood (Unfeeling deem'd) he heard the voice of woe —A virgin's voice—in plaintive accents flow. At length her suit the Mulberry thus renew'd: “What lust of blood, O cruel knight, detains Thy ruthless hand, and wantons in thy veins? O stain to arms!—I ask no mighty boon— Repair the ills those torturing hands have done! To bind the sever'd shoot requires no wondrous pains. “Or does the dread of magic spell control? Fear not, Sir knight!—no wizard here you see; And of what sorceries animate this tree My hand is guiltless, though I reek the dole.” As thus she sued, the champion heard, ashamed, His courage question'd, and his knighthood blamed; Compassion sway'd his courteous mind no less; For well he ween'd some damsel in distress Spake from that Mulberry stem, and knightly succour claim'd. Yet, ere his hands the reeking members close, The afflicted trunk proclaim'd a sudden fear, And thus exclaim'd: “Ah, yet the warning hear, Which my strange fate compels me to disclose. And Oh, may Heaven thy noble breast inspire With dauntless valour's never-dying fire! Nor be my wishes vain, which points to thee, The Saviour promised by that dark decree, Whose star and mine in Heaven eternally conspire. “Thus then the power that fix'd me in this rind, Compels me, trembling, hoping, to declare. If to my earnest suit you bend an ear, And the lopp'd branch again by thee be join'd, From prison worse than death you free a maid, Than whom a fairer graced not Tempé's shade; A fiendish Sorcerer's spell you overthrow, Bid a great monarch's heart with joy o'erflow, And with his daughter's love the deed shall be repaid. “Yet, ere the spell be broke, and damsel freed, Seven tedious years the wizard uncontroll'd Must o'er this vale unquestion'd empire hold. Seven tedious years, ('tis so by fate decreed,) If to thy knighthood true, by pity sway'd, By dark Satanic engines undismay'd, Thou dare achieve this feat—seven tedious years, Thyself, amid perpetual griefs and fears, Must linger out a hopeless life in Tempé's shade. “More that stern power forbids me to declare, What torments wait thee, and what toils beset: If, darkly told, they fright, avoid them yet! Leave me to bleed, and shun the fearful snare. Still may'st thou safe from Tempé's vale retire, New glories wait thee, other loves inspire; From these deep shades no tongue can e'er repeat To scandal's ear the shame of base retreat; Thine honour still may shine with undiminish'd fire.” “O gentle Knight!”. . . . but here her accents fail; For now the hardening fibres choke her breath, And heavier fall the thickening drops of death. Who but may guess the sequel of my tale? Who doubts if Denis, true to knightly vow, With tender care restored the sever'd bough; Seven years content his alter'd form to keep, In faith assured the bright reward to reap, And pay for future bliss the fine of suffering now? 'Twas faith like this, in Nature's virgin prime, Ere all of good, or great, or fair, or just, Lay in the scale like grains of worthless dust, Against successful fraud, and purpled crime; Ere Truth was forced the sceptre to resign, And blasts of Mammon banish'd airs divine; 'Twas faith like this, ensuring power to save, To English George his rescued Sabra gave, And noble Denis crown'd with love of Eglantine. THE ABBOT OF DOL. PART I. 'Tis straunge that divers minds so diverslie Of metaphysicke subtilties doe deeme. There be whoe scoffe at faytes of devilrie, And 'count them all meer coinage of a dreame: But these, I trow, have more of wit than grace— Why else doth Abbott Wulpho veile his face? Which whilom was a Priest of faire renowne As ever wonn'd in londe of Christentie, And hath been known to calle high angells downe From Heaven, to listen his divinitie, Whereby he gain'd the Abbaye of Seinct Pol, Near Englysshe sea, fast by the towne of Dol. When as his friers, in solemn service dredde, Their mattin chaunt and lowlie vespers sing, What now makes Abbott Wulpho veile his hedde, That none him see, nor he sees anything? Foul tales will spred of holiest-seeming wight When he so wilful seekes to shunne the light. Whilom, when priests and reverend bishopps rode In seemlie guise to Redons' neighbouring towne, “Redons' neighbouring towne.” By this pedantic appellation is probably meant Rennes, the capital of Britanny, and ancient city of the Redones, an Armorican tribe. It seems evident that the narrator was an English schoolmaster taking the benefit of a holiday excursion on horseback along the coast of France. Whiles one a mare, and one a mule bestrode, Low trailing on the ground his decent gowne, For seemlie order, and for decent stole, Was none colde mate the Seinctlie prior of Dole. And when in Redon towne they all did meete, Bishoppe and Abbott, cowléd Monk and Priest— Fayre brotherhood—in grave debate to treate Of holie churche,—and, now and thanne, to feast, Ymongst them alle was none so far renownde For winning rhetorike or sense profounde. Yet now he never doth his cloyster leave For feast or grave debate in Redon towne, But haply, at the solemn hour of eve, Walks lonely forth, enwrapt in sable gowne, With cowle that hides his face from mortal ken, And rude inquiry of observant men. And ever wends he, at the hour of prayer, To chappelle, and his throne accustom'd takes; But there he muttereth vowes that none may hear, And, whiles he muttereth, his bodye shakes. He brings, I wis, no angells down perforce, As erst from Heaven, to harken his discourse. Earl Conan was a lord of great domain That skirted round the Abbaye-lands of Dol. A childe he was of arms and lineage vain, And scorn'd the letter'd Abbott of Seinct Pol; Whose scorn the church-man met with holy pride, Enow to fill the countrie farr and wide. The Earl, a mighty hunter eke was he, Aye following of the chace with hound and horn, Reckless alike an 'twere the forest free, Or vineyard fenced, or field of standing corn. The Abbott these unhallow'd sports eschew'd, And roused to wrath the neighbouring rusticks rude. And, more their lawless bosoms to inspire With hate of rule and rage enkankeréd, An English mastiffe full of savage fire Did ever close behind his foot-steps tred; And oft-times with a holie oathe he swore, But for such guard, a perill'd life he bore. Eft soones, this mastiff, let abroade to stray, A sore disturber of the chase became, Dogs, horses, huntsmen, scared and drove away, And tore with bloody fangs the noblest game. The Earl vow'd vengeance on his head, the while Dan Wulpho eyed him with a ghostly smile. By threats, and oaths, and curses undismay'd, Still loose Dan Wulpho let the mastiff roam, Till, caught at last, with clubs and stones assaied, The yelling savage limp'd, disabled, home. The church-man, he was fill'd with rage, I ween, Yet hid in saintlie shew his inward teen. Next day, at Matins, he to chapel came: Pale was his visage, his demeanour wild. His coal-black eyes shot forth a living flame; His saintly forehead was with blood defiled. All there, I guess, full little praied that day, Onlesse from Satan's power their souls to stay. At last, the Abbott, as he slowly rose, With hollow tones of drearie import sed— “Attend, my brethren, whiles my lips disclose A wondrous vision granted from the ded; And lerne henceforth, from Conan's dismal rewe, What griefs the sacrilegious wretche persewe. “To sley a manne is deeméd felonye, To sley a Prieste is treason, worse in sort; But Heaven, that view'th with special clemencye The lowest menial of its holie court, Hath curst thee, Conan, for the fell cross-bow That caused an Abbott's mastiff lame to go. “These eyes beheld him when the prince of ill Three demons summon'd from their dismall cave, Beheld them as they hasten'd to fulfill The direful mandate that their master gave, Beheld them with their damnéd prisoner fly, Athwart the barriers of this nether sky. “I saw them tear his precious sight away, And cast the bleeding eye-balls on the ground; I saw their fangs his writhing members flay, And in his harte-strings print the torturing wound. Then on Saint Michael's stairs the corse they threw, Where limbs disjointed all the place did strew. “This was no idle mintage of the brain, The blood upon my brow the truth declares, The blood that sprinkled like a show'r of rain Saint Michael's steep ascent and holy staires.” The 'mazed brethren heard, with silent dred, This tale of vengeance on the impious hed. Earl Conan on that day to hunt had gone, And never from the hunting came again; And through the country round the tale when known Was well believed by every simple swain, They shunn'd the spot where Conan's restless sprite Still follows up the ghostly chace all night. But Abbott Wulpho never since that day Hath raised the cowl that shadows o'er his brows. When others tell their beads and loudly pray, He trembling muttereth unheard oaths and vows, And never since hath pass'd his Abbaye's bound, Nor joins in converse with the monkes around. PART II. Alone, on horse-back, from the towne of Dol, Full of this tale I journey'd forth at eve: Moche it perplex'd with doubt and feer my soul, As one scarse knowing what he mote believe— 'Twas hard to think the Count so foully dyed, Yet harder still to deeme an Abbott lyed. The night was overcast with murky cloudes, And rain beganne to powre, and winde to blow: “This is the time,” me-thought, “when ghosts in shrowdes Walk in the shrieking churche-yards to and fro.” Unwonted tremour o'er my members stole, As thus I journey'd thro' the wood of Dole. When lo! I heard afar a bugle horn That faintly stole upon the plaintive breeze: The sound, so cheerful mark'd at break of morn, Now mingled horrour with the moaning trees. Methought no earthly huntsman ere did blow So strange a strain, so solemne and so slow. And therewithall I heard the howl of hounds, The huntsman's hoarse halloo, the tramp of steeds: The forest groan'd in cadence, with its sounds Of crashing boughs, torn trunks, and rustling reeds. My senses shrank aghast with new affright— “No earthly hunters chase so late at night.” Nigher and nigher drew the distant rout, And seemes less earthly as it comes more near: The hounds more harshly howl; more hoarsely shout The viewless huntsmen, hallooing in the rear. In that wild crash all noises else were drown'd; My frighten'd horse stood still like one astound. As the fierce hurricanoe sweeps along, Uproots big oaks, tall castles overturns, And, shaking earth's foundations deep and strong, Lays bare to sight old Neptune's hidden urns, So loud and fierce that tempest hurried by, Like Heaven, Earth, Hell, in one commingled cry. At once around, beneath, and over head, It seem'd to pass—then all was hush'd and still: But as the thunder, when its bolt is sped, Is heard faint echoing from some distant hill, So, when that soul-subduing peal was past, The plaintive bugle swell'd upon the blast. At length, as in the rear of that wild train, A white plume swiftly pass'd my eyes before: My steed, awaken'd from its stound again, Following that meteor-form, its rider bore (All powerless to restrain) by brake and brier, O'er rough rude rocks, and thorough quag and mire. And ever was that snow-white plume our guide, Like Northern Bear to wandering marinere, Or that blest starre that led thro' deserts wide The eastern wise-men to our master deare; Till deeper still the darkness round us lay; And then it melted, like thinne ayre, away. Me seeméd now together we were brought Beneath some hollow arch, my horse and I. I stopp'd and hearken'd; but no sound I caught Save, at long intervalls, the scritch-owle's cry: At length I saw, as 'twere a taper's ray Shoot through the gloom, and thereby shaped my way. It was a chappell, half to ruin gone, From whose east window flash'd that welcome ray: My reeking steed I bridled to a stone, And reach'd a portall that adjoyning lay; There entering in, before the tapers lighte Beheld the figure of a kneeling Knighte, In hunter's garb array'd from top to toe; A bauldricke was across its shoulders flonge; In its right hand it grasp'd a hunter's bow; A hunter's bugle at its back was honge; A mailéd shirt peep'd forth beneath its vest, And snow-white plume waved nodding o'er its crest. At the high altar supplicant it kneel'd, Seemingly muttering some holy prayer; Then slowly turning round its head reveal'd A face illumined by the taper's glare, Pale—haggard—bloody; but I saw displaied Earl Conan's features in the specter shade. The grisly specter raised its beaver'd crest, And shew'd a throat deep gored with gaping wound; It pointed sadly to its bleeding breast, And with a heart-enthralling dolour groan'd; Then, like a guiltie soule, at breake of day, Thrise waved its head, and vanishedde away. Into thinne ayre it vanisht like a dreame, Leaving me sore astonied and dismaied: But where it late had knelt, a ruddie gleame As from a torche, upon the pavement plaied; And, on what seem'd a grave-stone, where I stood, I saw engraved in characterrs of blood— LEGENDE. “Straunger! whoe'er thou art, praie for the soule Of one whose naked corse lies festering nighe— Conan, by name—once puissaunt Earle of Dole; Whose bloud for Heavén's vengeaunce loud doth crye; And Abbott Wulpho's was the devilysshe hande That shed Earl Conan's bloud upon the lande. “Nor judge that, even in this worlde of sinne, Foul murther unrequyted doeth remaine. Whosoe with innocent bloud hath 'filed bin Shall never from his forehead wype the staine; But, tho' he vaile his crime from human eye, Heaven's justice view'th its foule deformitie.” These words scarse redde, away the vision stole, Stone, altar, taper, from my wondering sight: The dawn had brighten'd, and the towres of Dole Gay sparkled with the fresh Auroraes light, Seen thro' the forest leaves, where, late so drear, Now sweet birds chaunt their carolls loud and clear. Nought but the ruin'd arch remain'd in view, Of all the wonders I had seen, to tell; And tho' I scarse cold hope for credence dew, Nathless, as if constrain'd by hidden spell, I back return'd, and to the Provost there Did the whole truth, on solemn oath, declare. All day his archers scour'd the forest o'er: At evening, underneath a turfy mount But loosely hid with leaves, and stiffe with gore, They found the murther'd body of the Count. Him nowe in holie earthe they softe enshrine, But vengeaunce leave to Him who saith, “Tis mine.” For this doth Abbott Wulpho shrowde his face; Who, tho' above the reach of Human sway, Yet knows, as one debarr'd from Heavén's grace, That innocent bloud can ne'er be washt away, And therefore feares to shew to man, what He Who sits above, beholds Eternallye. THE DEAD MEN OF PEST. I left the chaulkie cliftes of Old Englónde, And paced thro' manie a region faire to see, Thorowe the reaulme of Greece, and Holie Londe, Untille I journied into sadde Hongrie. I sawe old Cecrops' towne, and famous Rome; But Davydd's holie place I lykéd best; I sawe straunge syghtes that made me pyne for home, Bot moche the straungest in the towne of Pest. It was a goodlie citye, fayre to see; By its prowde walles and statelie towres it gave A delicate aspéct to the countrée, With its brigg of boates across the Danow's wave. Yet many thinges with grief I did survaie: The stretys all were mantell'd o'er with grass, And, tho' it were upon the sabbath daie, No belles did tolle to call the folke to masse. The churchyard gates with barrs were closyd fast, Like to a sinnefull and accursedde place; It shew'd as tho' the judgment daie were past, And the dedde exyléd from the throne of Grace. At last an agéd carle came halting bye— A wofull wyghte he was, and sadde of cheere— Of whom, if aught of cell or bowre were nighe, For wearie pilgrimme's rest, I 'ganne to speire. “Straunger!” he sedde, “in Marye's name departe!” And, whan thus spoken, wolde have past me by. His hollowe voyce sanke deepe into my harte; Yet I wolde not lett him passe, and askyd, “Why?” “'Tis now mid daye,” quoth hee, “the sunne shines brighte, And all thinges gladde, bot onlie heare in Peste: But an 'twere winter wylde, at dedde of nighte, Not heare, O straunger, sholdst thou seke to reste; Tho' rain in torrents fell, and cold winde blew, And thou with travell sore, and honger pale.” “Tho' the sunne,” saied I, “shine brighte, and the day be newe, Ile not departe ontill thou's tolde thy tale.” This wofull wyghte thanne toke me by the honde; His, like a skeletonne's, was bonie and colde. Hee lean'd, as tho' hee scarse mote goe or stonde, Like one who fourscore yeares hath, haply, tolde. We came togither to the market-crosse, And the wyghte, all wo begon, spake never worde; Ne living thinge was sene our path to crosse, (Tho' dolours grones from many a house I herde,) Save one poore dogge, that stalk'd athwart a courte, Fearfullie howling with most pyteous wayle: The sad manne whistled in a dismall sorte, And the poore thing slunk away and hidd his tayle. I felt my verye bloud crepe in my vaynes; My bones were icie-cold, my hayre on end: I wish'd myself agen upon the playnes, Yet cold not but that sad old manne attend. The sadd old manne sate down upon a stone, And I sate on another at his side. He hevéd mournfully a pyteous grone, And thanne to ease my dowtes his selfe applyde. “Straunger!” quoth he, “regard my visage well, And eke these bonie fingerrs feel agen— Howe manie winterrs semyth it they tell?” I dowtingly replyde, “Three-score and ten.” “Straunger! not fourty yeres agonn I laye An infant, mewling in the nurse's armes; Not fourty dayes agonn, two daughterrs gaye Did make me joyful by their opening charmes. “Yet now I seme some fowrscore winterrs olde, And everie droppe of bloud hath left my vaynes; Als' my fayre daughterrs twayne lye stiffe and colde, And bloudless, bound in Deth's eternall chaynes. “Straunger! this towne so pleasaunt to our syghtes, With goodly towres and palaces so fayre, Whilom for gentle dames and valiaunt knyghtes, From all Hongaria's londe the mede did beare. “But now the few, still rescow'd from the dedde, Are sobbing out their breath in sorie guyse; Alle, that had strength to flee, long since have fledde, Save onlye I, who longe to close mine eyes. “Seaven weekes are past sithence our folk begann To pyne, and falle away—no reason why; The ruddiest visage turn'd to pale and wann, And glassie stillnesse film'd the brightest eye. “Some Doctours sedde, the lakes did agews breede, Bot spring retorning wold the same disperse, Whiles others, contrarie to nature's creede, Averr'd the seasonn's chaunge wold make us worse. “And tho' we leugh at these, like doaters fonde, Or faytours wont in paradoxe to deele, Yet, as the sun wax'd warm, throughout the londe, Alle menne the more did wintrie shiverings feele. “At length it chaunc'd that one of station highe Fell sicke, and dyed uponn the seaventh daie: They op'd the corse the hidden cause to spie, And founde that alle the bloud was drain'd awaie. “There was a tailour, Vulvius by name, Who longe emongste us dwelt in honest pride; A worthie citizenne esteem'd by fame; That since some monéth of a soddeine dyde. “Now thus it happ'd—as oft it chaunceth soe— That, after he was gon, straunge rumours spred Of evill haunts where 'twas his wont to goe, And midnight visitacyonns to the ded. “Now, whanne this fearfull maladye had growne To soche an hyght as men were loath to saye, Emongst the reste in our unhappie towne, My darlinge doughterrs sore tormentyd laye. “Nathless I mark'd that ever whiles they pyned Their appetyte for foode encrees'd the more; They fedde on richest meates whene'er they dyn'd, And drancke of old Tokaye my choicest store. “Thus, everie eve, their colour fresh arose, And they did looke agen both briske and gaye; All nighte depe slomberrs did their eyelidds close; Bot worse and worse they woxe by breake of daye. “One nyght yt chauncyd, as they slepyng laied, Their serving wenche at midnight sought their room, To bring some possett, brothe, or gellie, made To quelle the plague that did their lives consume. “Whenne, ere she reach'd the spot, a heavie sound Of footsteps lumbering up the stayre she heard; And, soon as they had gain'd the top-most round, The buried tailour to her sighte appear'd. “She herd him ope my daughters' chamber dore— (Her lighte lett falle, she had no force to crye,) Then, in briefe space, agen—for soe she swore, It lumber'd downe; but farre more heavilee. “This storye herde, albe' I inly smyl'd To think the seely mayd such fears cold shake, Yet, the nexte nighte, to prove her fancies wyld, I kept myselfe, till past midnighte, awake: “Whanne, at the midnighte belle, a sounde I herd Of heavie lumbering stepps, a sound of dred; The tailour Vulvius to my sighte appeard; And all my senses at the instant fledde. “Next daye, I founde a fryer of mickle grace, A learnéd clerke, and praied he wold me rede, In soche a straunge, perplext, and divellishe case, His ghostly counsaile how 'twere best procede. “Into the churchyarde wee together wente, And hee at everie grave-stone saied a prayer; Till at the tailour Vulvius' monimente We stopt—a spade and mattoke had we there. “Wee digg'd the earth wherein the tailour laye, Till at the tailour's coffyn we arrived, Nor there, I weene, moche labour fonde that daye, For everie bolt was drawen and th'hinges rived. “This sighte was straunge, bot straunger was to see; The corse, tho' laid som monéth's space in mold, Did shew like living manne, full blythe of glee, And ruddie, freshe, and comelie to behold. “And now the cause wee happlie mote presume. The vampire—so he named this demonne guest— Had burst the sacred cerements of the tomb, And of the buried corse himselfe possest. “This newes, whanne thro' the towne wee made it knowne, Unusual horrour seised the stoutest wyghtes, As deming not the tailour's grave alone Had so bin made a haunt of dampnéd sprites. “The churchyarde now was diggéd all aboute, And everie new made grave laid bare to viewe, Whanne everie corse that they dyd digge thereoute, Seem'd, like the firste, of freshe and ruddie hewe. “'Twas plain, the corses that the churchyards fill'd, Were they whoe nightly lumber'd upp our stayre, Whoe suck'd our bloud, the living banquette swill'd, And left us alle bestraughte with blanke despayre. “And nowe the Priestes burne incense in the choyre, And scatter Ave-maries o'er the grave, And purifye the churche with lustrall fire, And caste alle things profane in Danowe's wave; “And they've barr'd with ironne barrs the churchyarde pale, To kepe them inn; but vayne is alle they doe: For whan a ded manne hath lernt to drawe a nayle, Hee can also burste an ironne bolte in two.” The sadde old manne here endyd. I arose, With myngled greefe and wonderment possest: I rode nine leagues or ere I sought repose, And never agen came nigh the towne of Peste. For the origin of the above legend, the reader is referred to a superstition long prevalent in Hungary, and other Sclavonian countries, which has been lately rendered familiar to us, by a spell far more potent than any inherent in these rude verses. It may, however, be added, that the present poem, in which some slight alterations have since been made, first appeared in a periodical work of which Dr. Aikin was editor, (the Athenæum,) some years previous to the date of Lord Byron's “Giaour,” and that it is believed, with some confidence, to have furnished the noble poet with the hint of the passage beginning, “But first, on earth as vampire sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt thy native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life, Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse.” Leaving, however, this question, the present tale may (if the reader pleases,) be presumed, from its style and language, to be the work of the same learned pedagogue as was conjectured to be the author of the preceding story; who, after renouncing the arduous labours of his profession, must be supposed to have devoted a twelvemonth or more to the various objects of foreign travel, and to have given vent to “Crudities” which may be compared with those of honest Tom Coryate. And, with reference to the former poem, it may in this place be observed,—what was omitted in the note at its conclusion,—that, although the names of Earl Conan and Abbot Wulpho would seem to point to a much earlier period of Armorican history, they were probably adopted as a convenient veil for the real circumstances, which cannot, from the style of narration, be referred to an earlier date than the commencement of our Elizabethan æra. But this subject may be thought worthy the investigation of some learned and ingenious member of the recently formed “Camden Society.” THE WRAITH. Cold blew the breeze of early day, And furious fell the driving sleet; Sir Lodowicke on the banks of Tay Was riding from his castle seat. On him the storm unheeded beat, Unfelt the wintry breezes blew, For she he hoped at eve to meet Alone possess'd his fancy's view. Long captive, and of hope forlorn, He bow'd beneath the paynim foe, Nor, all the time, were tidings borne Of his sweet Emmeline's weal or woe; And now with beating heart, where glow Alternate hopes, and terrors lower, Through piercing wind, and driving snow, He sought his lovely Emmeline's bower. And first he cross'd the rivulet's fall, Where oft, in childhood's joyous day, An orphan in his father's hall, She with him used at eve to stray; Next by the bank pursued his way, Which Emmeline loved, at early morn, To deck with flowers and garlands gay— Now rough with tangled brier and thorn. And now that ancient oak he spied, The best loved tree of all the glade, Where first his amorous vows he sigh'd, And woo'd and won the plighted maid. Thither his steps unbidden stray'd; But lightning had the branches torn, And the bare roots, by storms assay'd, Groan'd to the boisterous breath of morn. A keener air upon him blew, Mix'd with a sound so sadly shrill, As pierced his shuddering members through, And made each vein with horrour thrill. A dark preságe of future ill Confusedly pass'd his senses o'er, When, heard by fits, long, faint and still, The kirk bell chimed the hour of four. Then first, while, shivering with the breeze, He closer folds his mantle round, Dim through the murky mist he sees, Stretch'd on the bleak unshelter'd ground, A maiden form. The winds around Unheeded roar—the driving snows Descend unfelt; nor sight, nor sound, Seem to disturb her last repose. He stretch'd his arms, and vainly tried To clasp that heavenly form so fair: The vision seem'd away to glide, And all he clasp'd was empty air. “O Emmeline sweet! O Emmeline rare! Say, dost thou not thy true love see? Or are his cheeks so changed with care, His eyes so sunk with slavery? “Ah! wherefore, wherefore fliest thou, fair? And wherefore to the inclement sky Dost thou that tender bosom bare, Nor heed the tempest rushing by?”— In vain he calls, since none is nigh— The phantom form no longer seen; But driving storms more fiercely fly, And the chill morning bites more keen. He looks around with eager eyes Through every opening glade, in vain: He calls aloud; but nought replies Save howling wind and beating rain. And now he spurs his steed amain, With desperate haste, mid wind and shower, Through bush and brier, o'er hill and plain, Until he stops at Emmeline's bower. Who first should meet his ardent sight? Who grant the kiss his raptures seek? Who, speechless, breathless with delight, Hide in his breast her glowing cheek? In vain they both attempt to speak; Love can no more than feel and see. At length the well-known accents break, “My love, my love, thrice welcome be! “My Lodowicke! Oh, an hour like this Might well reward an age of pain; Yet scarce for all this wondrous bliss Would I last night dream o'er again. What phantoms swarm'd about my brain! What shudderings stole my senses o'er! As if my soul its flight had ta'en To some dark, wintry, howling shore. “Long time in deadly trance I lay, A mass perplext of shapeless thought; Till fancy bore my soul away, And to the scenes of childhood brought. But when that trysted oak I sought By Lodowicke's early vows endear'd, The storm its lordly boughs had caught, And all its leaves were scorch'd and sear'd. “I laid me by that blasted tree, When, borne upon the tempest's roar, The old kirk bell toll'd sullenly, Through the dun air the hour of four. Again a deadly trance came o'er, And all my powers of sense were flown; But, O my loved one! 'tis no more, Thou, thou art here, and art mine own!” She said—O'er Lodowicke's heart, the while, A short, convulsive tremour stole; But soon his Emmeline's beaming smile Chased every cloud that dimm'd his soul. Sweet music's voice, the inspiring bowl, But most his Emmeline's artless glee, Disperse the vapours as they roll, And melt in gleams of extacy. Her Lodowicke safe—her Lodowicke near— All care forsook the maiden's breast, Light was her heart, unused to fear, And golden slumbers crown'd her rest. But when her form no longer bless'd His sight, her voice his spirit charm'd, Wild fancy's train again possess'd His thoughts, and vital powers disarm'd. Then ever as with rapturous love His mind he turn'd to Emmeline fair, The shape those torturing spectres wove Was wan with woe, and pale with care, And blighted by the noisome air That shrewdly nipp'd its shivering form, And through its wet, unbraided hair Shrill whistled to the driving storm. All night his fever'd couch he press'd; Hour after hour pass'd joyless o'er: Till, striking chillness to his breast, He heard the well-mark'd sound of four. From trance he started, when before His eyes appear'd his spectre-bride; But, while he gazed, she was no more, And in the cold pale moon-light died. Deep horror seized each vital power, His limbs were stiffen'd, fix'd his eyes; When from fair Emmeline's distant bower Low murmuring sounds were heard to rise; Then, more distinct, shrill female cries; Louder and louder—not a breath Is breathed around—no groans—no sighs; One long, long shriek—the shriek of Death. Fate strikes the forest's blooming pride; The ivied oak resists its spell: “The bridegroom may forget the bride,” But in Dunfermline's lowliest cell A lonely friar was known to dwell, Who threescore years for death had pray'd— How fervently no tongue can tell— Death comes not to the wretch's aid. THE ENGLISH SAILOR AND THE KING OF ACHEN'S DAUGHTER. Come, listen, gentles all, And ladies unto me, And you shall hear of as stout a sailér As ever sail'd on sea. 'Twas in the month of May, Sixteen hundred sixty four, We sallied out all fresh and stout, In the good ship Swiftsure. With wind and weather fair We sail'd from Plymouth Sound, And the line we cross'd, and the Cape we pass'd, For we were to China bound. And we sail'd by Sunda isles, And Ternate and Tydore, Till the wind it lagg'd, and our sails they flagg'd, In sight of Achen's shore. Becalm'd, days three times three, We lay in the burning sun; Our water was rank and our meat it stank, And our biscuit was well nigh done. And we slowly paced the deck, So long as our legs would bear us; And we thirsted all, but no rain did fall, And no dews descend to cheer us. And the red red sun from the sky, Sent his scorching beams all day, Till our tongues hung out, all black with drought, And we had no voice to pray. Then the hot hot air from the south Oppress'd our lungs all night, As if the grim devil, with his throat full of evil, Had blown on each troubled sprite. At length it so befell, While we all in our hammocks lay, Quite scant of breath, and expecting death To come ere break of day; At once a pleasant breeze Sprang up amidst the shrowds, And the big round rain dropp'd down amain From its cisterns in the clouds. I open'd my heavy eyes, And my mouth, I open'd it wide; And my heart rejoiced, and my throat was moist, And “A breeze! a breeze!” I cried. But no man heard me cry, And the breeze again sank down, And a noise like thunder, with fright and wonder, Nigh cast me in a swoune. I dared not look around, Till, by degrees made bolder, When I saw a sprite, through the pale star-light, Dim glimmering at my shoulder. He was clad in a sailor's jacket, Wet trowsers and dripping hose, And an unfelt wind I heard behind That whistled among his clothes. I kenn'd him by the stars, And the moon, as it faintly shone, And I knew, though his face was seam'd with scars, John Jewkes, my sister's son. “John Jewkes!” I exclaim'd, “Alack, Poor boy, what brings thee here?” But nothing he said, but hung down his head, And made his bare scull appear. Then, by my grief made bold, I to take his hand endeavour'd; But his head he turn'd round, which a gaping wound Had clean from his shoulders sever'd. He open'd his mouth to speak, Like a man with his last breath struggling; And with every word in his throat I heard, A queerish sort of guggling. At last he, guggling, said, “Kind uncle, touch not me! For the fish have my head, and my trunk lies dead, And 'tis only my ghost you see. “You surely must remember, Three years agone this day, How at aunt's we tarried, when sister was married To farmer Robin May. “Oh! then were we blythe and jolly; But none of us all had seen, While we sang and laugh'd, and the stout ale quaff'd, That our number was thirteen: “And none of all the party At the head of the table saw, While the flask went round to the tabor's sound, Old Goody Martha Daw. “Yet Martha Daw was there, Though she never spoke no word, And beside her sat her old black cat, Though it neither mew'd nor purr'd. “On her crooked staff she hobbled, And a bundle of sticks she broke, And her prayers all jumbled she backward mumbled, Though never a word she spoke. “'Twas on a Friday morning, That very day was a se'nnight, I ran to sweet Sue, to bid her adieu, —For I could not stay a minute. “Then, crying with words so tender, She gave me a true love's locket, And bad me still love her, forgetting her never, —So I put it in my pocket. “And then we kiss'd and parted; But we knew not, all the while, Martha Daw was by, with her crutch, to spy, Looking on with a fiendish smile. “So I went to sea again, With my heart brimful of Sue; Though my mind misgave me, the salt waves would have me, And I'd taken my last adieu, “A prosperous voyage we had, 'Till we came to this hellish coast, When a tempest did rise, in seas and in skies, That we gave ourselves for lost. “Our good ship it was stranded All on the shoals of Achen, And all but myself were put on the shelf, And I only just saved my bacon. “For it chanced that very minute The black king, walking by, Beheld me sprawling, and scarcely crawling, And took home to his house hard by. “Then, bethinking him I was A likely lad for to see, My bones well knit and of passing wit, And not above twenty-three, “He made me his gardener boy, To sow pease and potatoes, To water his flowers in lack of showers, And cut his parsley and lettuce. “Now it fell out, of a Sunday, (Which these Pagans never keep holy,) I was picking rue, and thinking on Sue, With a heart right melancholy, “When the king of Achen's daughter Threw open her casement to see; And, as she look'd round on the gooseberry ground, Her eyes fell full on me; “And seeing me tall and slim, And of shape right personable, With skin so white, and so very unlike The blacks at her father's table, “She took it into her head, (Or else the devil did move her,) That I, in good sooth, was a likely youth, And would make a gallant lover. “So she tripp'd from her chamber high, All in silks and satins clad, And her gown it rustled, as down she bustled With steps like a princess sad. “Her shoes they were deck'd with pearls, And her hair with diamonds glisten'd, And her jewels and toys, they made such a noise, My mouth water'd whilst I listen'd. “Then she tempted me with glances, And with sugar'd words so tender— And, although black, she was strait in the back, And young, and tall, and slender. “But I my love remember'd, And the locket she once did give me, And resolved to be true to my darling Sue, As she did ever believe me. “Whereat the princess wax'd Right furious and angry, And said, she was sure I had some paramour In kitchen or in laundry. “Then, with a devilish grin, Says she, Give me that locket,— But I call'd her a witch, and a conjuring bitch, And kept it in my pocket. “Howbeit both night and day, She still did torture and teaze me; And swore, if I'd yield to her the field, To do all she could to please me. “Says she, only give me the locket, And bide three months with me, If then the will remains with you still, I'll ship you off to sea. “So I thought it the only way To behold my lovely Sue; Also, thinking of England, it made me tingle, and I gave up my locket so true. “Thereupon she laugh'd outright With a hellish grin—and I saw The lady no more, but where she stood afore, Now stood old Martha Daw. “She was sitting astride a broomstick, And bade me mount behind; So, my wits being lost, the broomstick I cross'd, And away we went swift as the wind. “But my head it soon grew giddy, I reel'd, and lost my balance; And I tumbled over, like a perjured lover, And a warning to all false gallants. “And there where I tumbled down, The Indians found me lying; My head they cut off, and my blood did quaff, And set my flesh a frying. “Hence, all ye English gallants, A warning take from me, Your true love's locket to keep in your pocket Whenever you go to sea. “And, oh dear uncle Thomas, I come to give you warning, As then 'twas my chance with Davy to dance, 'Twill be yours to-morrow morning. “'Twas three years agone to-night, Three years gone clear and clean, When, a jovial set, at aunt's we met, And our number was thirteen. “Now I and sister Nan, Two of that jovial party, Have gone from aunt's, with Davy to dance, Tho' then we were young and hearty, “And since we both kick'd the bucket —I speak it with pain and sorrow, At the end of each year, it seems quite clear That you must kick it to-morrow. “Howsoever good uncle Thomas, If you'll promise, and promise truly, To plough back the main for old England again, And perform my orders duly, “Old Davy will still allow you Another year to live, To visit your friends, and make up your ends, And your enemies forgive. “But mind when you first reach England, To Launc'ston town you wag, And there, (to make short,) in open court, Impeach that d?d old hag. “And then you must see her hang'd, Without any doubt whatever, And, when void of life, with your own clasp knife The string of her apron sever. “And, if that you determine My last behests to do, In her left hand pocket you'll find the locket, And carry it to Sue.” These words that grisly spectre In guggling accents spoke, When, it now being morning, he gave no warning, But vanish'd away like smoke. And there sprang up a breeze that day, And our ship began for to tack, And to please the ghost, we left the coast, And steer'd for Old England back. Then I, as soon as landed, Did his last commands pursue; Old Martha likewise I saw hung at 'Sise, And took the locket to Sue. And now of life being weary, I've made up my mind to die, But I thought this sad story I'd lay before ye For the good of posteritie. So take good heed that never You sit thirteen at table, And true love's token to keep unbroken,— At least so long as you're able. THE MARESCHAL AND THE BARBER. A TALE. AFTER THE MANNER OF COLMAN. There's ne'er a skin so exquisitely fair Among our beaux and belles of noble blood, But those whom chance has lifted from the mud In Fortune's richest gifts to hold a share, Make, with their tough and sun-tann'd hides, pretence To a still more refined and tender sense. Of such a hide as this my story goes, Whose owner—bony, gaunt, a man of swagger, Of popgun, harquebuse, and dagger— ('Twas one of Bonaparté's maréchaux—) Forgetting that his father, A plain painstaking man of labour, Had pass'd his life, like many a neighbour, Unconscious of the sin of lather, Now, in support of his gentility, Affected so much sensibility Of beard, That it appear'd No barber in all Paris knew To pay his ducal visage reverence due. Were I to speak How many tonsors in a week He kill'd with fright At the big, round, and dreadful oaths he swore, You'd fancy that I lied outright, And hear no more. Nathless, he found at last an operator, Who work'd with so much ease and taste, And used so excellent a shaving paste, That, tho' a prater, He never gave his highness cause to swear More than a simple oath or two, (As “Sacredi,” or “Ventrebleu,”) From early Floréal to late Frimaire, All summer through. Of winter I say nothing; Heaven well knew, When, for our father Adam's sin, It sent a covering for the human chin, Earth has no torment like the adorning One's face for breakfast on a frosty morning. Then, be the razor dull, or razor bright, A parson's self must swear—a soldier rave outright. It chanced, as once our artist sat With a young brother tonsor, close in chat, ('Twas at a tavern, where good cheer they made, And of good liquor quaff'd their fill,) At last they fell to talking of their trade, Each loudly boasting his superior skill; Whereon our master barber, in a fume, (Whether of anger or of wine) Cried, “Odds, young whipster, and dost thou presume To match thy clumsy fist with mine? Go to, you silly knave, for shame! When there's the duke of—What's his name? Who, were the razor ne'er so bright and keen, Would never think it shaved him clean— In short, all Paris knows his surly humour— Yet now, I mow his chin so smooth and flat, He never grumbles. Who'll do more than that?” “Zounds!” said the Gascon artisan, “I'll do more.” “What canst thou do, O peasant slave and vile? “Wo't drink up Eysel?—eat a crocodile?” “Let me, to-morrow, go instead of you, And, Sacredieu! I'll shave but half his face, leaving the other As guiltless of the razor as my mother; Yet, when I've finish'd, make the duke declare, I suit him to a hair; And pay me too.”—“Done, for a ducat!”—“Done! And, as I live, the wager's fairly won.” Next day, our Senior feign'd indisposition, And sent his Gascon friend, who craved permission To pass a whetted razor o'er the face, So tender, of his grace. Leave given, with all a Gascon's modesty, He plants himself, easy and free, In the Duke's anti-chamber,—takes his station, And waits till, rising out of feather-bed, In stalks, with awe-inspiring tread, The barber-killing conqueror of Bagration; Who, eying first the Gascon round and round, And seeing him so tall, well-limb'd, and stout, Perhaps might entertain a doubt Whether, if he had chanced to meet the peasant Alone, in a dark lane, he might have found It quite so pleasant: Since, howsoe'er it be, The bravest man amongst us must confess He cannot treat a rogue of six foot three, Like one whose stature is six inches less. So to this youth, so stout and large of bone, The Marshal growl'd forth in a lower tone Than was his custom with the shaving crew. He sate, and bad the knave commence his work; Who, setting to like any Turk, Mow'd half the face before his patient knew The business was begun. But, tho' in skill our Gascon had it hollow, The worst was yet to follow Before the wager could be fairly won. With half a beard the Duke to satisfy? —Sir Huon had not ne'er so hard a job To pull the teeth out of his old Nabób. What can he do?—He lays his razor by, And, keeping still his former station, Turns up his eyes, and clasps his hands, And like a living statue stands, Muttering some strange ejaculation. At first the Marshal stares both east and west, Astonish'd at the tonsor's mien devout, Till, in the end, his patience quite worn out, In gentle phrase he thus the youth address'd. —“Morbleu!”. . . . His Grace, you've heard, was not select In choice of fashionable oaths; For men change not their fashions with their clothes, And from a Marshal what can you expect? “Sir,” said the Gascon, with a bow profound Down to the ground, “So please your highness of your wrath to spare I was at prayer.” “At prayer, you lousy scoundrel?—Sacredi! Is it a time to pray while shaving me?” —“Prayer never comes amiss, an't like your grace, In any place.” “Odslife! was ever such a shaver? The reason, sirrah, of this mad behaviour!” “Since”—calmly thus rejoin'd the youth— “Your highness bids me tell the truth, While shaving of your chin, I felt so curs'd And devilish an inclination To cut your noble throat, that I was forc'd To pray to God against the strong temptation.” “Zounds!” scream'd the Marshal, rising in a fright, “Out of my sight!” “What, sir! when I have shaved but half your chin? That were a sin. No, please your highness, keep your seat; I'm ready for the other side: The trials of the devil are great; But I've sufficiently been tried: And—I believe—I now may safely swear, To spare your weasand while I mow your hair.” —“Believe? you scurvy thief! Oons! shall I trust my throat to your belief? Here, Jean, Jacques, George!”—“Dread Sir, be quiet! I would not be the cause of riot; And thus to part would blast my reputation Before the nation. I cannot leave you thus.”—“Avaunt, Imp of the devil!”—“I must—” “Away!” —“Only one minute let me stay!” —“You sha'n't!” “I'll shave you smooth as when you first were born.” —“Zounds, sir! I like to be half-shorn.” —“O, sir, if you are satisfied—” “Rascal! I'm perfectly content.” —“I only hope, if you repent, You'll send for me to shave the other side. But, please your Grace, before I go— (Or otherwise, I shall be much afraid You're not well pleased—) your Grace must know—” —“Oh, certainly.—What ho! my page here! See that the gentleman is duly paid.” —“Good morning, sir! I've won my wager.” FROM THE ABBE DELILLE'S “L'IMAGINATION.” A beauteous flower Spain's glowing sun matured. Her virgin breast the power of love abjured Too long; for when at length the conqueror came, He fired her bosom with a fiercer flame: That flame, too precious for a sire's control, To young Alvarez yielded all her soul. My tale is short. The haughty father knew Their loves, and at her feet the lover slew. She seized the reeking blade with frantic fire, And to the lover sacrificed the sire. Thus were dissolved, in one short moment's time, By deeds of darkest and most hideous crime, The holiest and the softest ties below: —So mad is love when vengeance prompts the blow. But who, poor wretched maid, can picture thee? Victim of guilt, remorse, and misery? The horrid secret, to no creature known, Pent up, and raging in her breast alone, A solitary hut conceal'd her shame, And dark oblivion gather'd round her name. One peasant girl alone found entrance there, To be the witness of her black despair, But not the soul's deep mystery to share. No mortal ever, in the world's wide range, Gave such example of discordant change. Now plunged in gloomiest silence, dark and deep, The gnawing fiends of conscience seem'd to sleep; Then—as if all unable to control, And trample down the horror of the soul, The fearful struggle in her mind was seen Thro' her strain'd eye-balls and distorted mien; While, suddenly, as o'er a stormy sky, Some trembling sun-beam oft is seen to fly, Painting the sullen cloud with transient glow; So o'er her alter'd front, her sunken brow, Her features strain'd with agony, awhile Shoots a sweet, mournful, melancholy smile. But, durst she weep, her tears bring no relief— Those burning tears of unrelenting grief. Sudden—O horror! O refined distress! What beauteous scenes of childhood happiness Start to her troubled view!—she sees again That blissful age, exempt from guilt and pain, When a fond mother's tender kiss gave place, In playful contest, to a sire's embrace. O then, how heaved her breast, how roll'd her eye, How burst the thrilling shrieks of agony! O'er field and mountain, and the forest glade, Wander'd with hurrying steps the frantic maid, Rush'd o'er the plains, and darted thro' the shade; Till nature, tired, exhausted, quite gave way, And bloodless, breathless, on the earth she lay. E'en pangs like these bring solace to her care; For madness gives a vent to blank despair. But when, imprison'd in her hut alone, Her scatter'd senses reassume their tone, And all the wanderings of her fancy cease, Reason returns—but not with reason, peace. 'Twas then her heart appear'd to sink within, Weigh'd down by all the mightiness of sin: There, drop by drop, a father's blood distill'd, Mix'd with a lover's—blood her hands had spill'd; Now, with those parricidal hands, she tried To turn away the still returning tide; Now, close pursued by some avenging ghost, “Help, help,” she cried, “Alvarez! or I'm lost. See, see, O see, my angry father glare! Lo! the sharp steel!—O God, what sight is there? The same with which I shed his precious life—” Then would she bend, as if to shun the knife In fancy pointed—but, O agony! She cannot shun her soul; she cannot fly From those fell demons that her heart corrode: All paints her crime—all marks avenging God. Hell yawns—heaven thunders—the hot bolt is sent; Might God forgive—her soul can ne'er relent. At times she hopes—she bends her knees to pray— She clasps her hands—despairs—and dies away; Avenging God o'erwhelms her with dismay. Yet, not unoften, in her maddest mood, She stopp'd, observant, where the gloomy wood Of cypress join'd the elm's majestic shade, And round the village church a shelter made. It seem'd as if some hidden, viewless force, Awful, yet soothing to her soul's remorse, Here urged her on—but then a sudden fear, And horror seized her if she ventured near. Yet once, as round the pale she dared to stray, A simple peasant met her on her way, Whose saintly aspect fix'd her roving sight: Mild were his features, and his countenance bright Beam'd inward peace and fellowship with heaven, Which God's appointed minister had given. Surprised, encouraged, hoping, she draws nigh— She enters—she advances silently— Her trembling eyes can now at length endure The sight of that tribunal, just and pure, To true repentance ever open found. —She gazed, 'mid tears of anguish, wildly round— “That Judge severe, whose hallow'd throne I see, May mercy grant to all, but none to me!” A venerable man with age grown white, The pastor of the church, now met her sight; Whose useful days, some forty summers, ran In piety to God, and love to man. All shared his bounty—none his censure fear'd— Loved in his hamlet, in his church revered. His manners preach'd—his fair example taught, And warm'd the heart, and sanctified the thought. Both child and parent bless their strengthen'd tie, And e'en the infant, as he passes by, Extends his little hands in playful guile, And hangs delighted on the good man's smile. Of deep remorse assuager firm and sure— Refuge of sinners—yet himself most pure— Like some proud mountain, whose exalted head Sees storms and tempests far beneath it spread, While thunders roll around its breast, and die, Itself the tenant of a cloudless sky. Meeting, they paused—the opening sentence hung Ready to break—yet silence chain'd each tongue. With looks most eloquently mute, the maid At once conceal'd her secret, and betray'd. He ask'd her not a word—for souls refined Respect the secrets of a tortured mind; Yet his eye spoke such pity as perforce To win the confidence of true remorse. Together to the altar they drew near: She knelt, opprest by holy awe and fear. Three times her guilt hangs trembling, half reveal'd, And thrice her timid heart denies to yield; At length, impatient of the struggling load, Her full, o'erflowing soul gave way to God; And 'mid confession's sacred source she tries To read with hurried glance the good man's eyes. Moved by such sufferings, touch'd by such remorse, His lips dare open comfort's sacred source. She breathes once more—tears, long by misery dried, Pour from her soften'd eyes a copious tide— Not such as used from maddening rage to break, When burning torrents drench'd her furrow'd cheek, But pure delicious tears—those tears from heaven, By God himself to souls repentant given, Resembling, in their course, the dews of even; Refreshing, balmy, sent to give new birth To the parch'd fruits and drooping flowers of earth. Mean-time the priest, commission'd from the sky, Grants pardon in the name of the Most High. Oh who can paint the calm that hour bestow'd? She vows her heart, her prayers, her tears, to God. She feels her passion rest, her torments cease, And conscience seals heaven's promises of peace. FROM CHATTERTON'S “ÆLLA.” FIRST MINSTREL. The budding floweret blushes at the light, The meads are sprinkled with a saffron hue; In daisied mantle is the hill-top dight; The graceful cowslip bendeth with the dew: Thro' leafy trees, whose green heads kiss the skies, Waked by the gentle breeze, soft whisper'd murmurs rise. Gray evening comes, and brings the dews along; The western sky with golden radiance shines; Sweet minstrels tune their jocund village song, Young ivy round the cottage door-post twines; I lay me on the grass; yet, to my will, Tho' all is fair around, there wanteth something still. SECOND MINSTREL. So our first father thought in Paradise, Where heaven and earth did homage to his mind. In woman man's supremest pleasure lies, Man's first and best delight is woman-kind. Go—take a wife unto thine arms, and see! Winter, and russet hills, will then have charms for thee. THIRD MINSTREL. When autumn sere and sun-burnt doth appear, With cunning hand gilding the changeful leaf, Bringing up winter to fulfill the year, And bearing on his back the welcome sheaf; With forest seed when all the hills are white, And thro' the kindled sky swift streams the northern light; When the fair apple, red as evening sky, Doth bend the tree unto the fruitful ground; When juicy pears, and berries of black dye, Dance in the air, and all is glad around; Then, be the evening foul, or evening fair, Methinks the heart's delight is strangely check'd by care. SECOND MINSTREL. Angels are painted as of neither kind, And angels only from desire have rest. There is a something in the manly mind That, without woman, can be never blest. There is no sainted hermit, but the sight Of lovely woman warms, and cheers his dulled sprite. Woman for man—not for herself—was made; Bone of his bone, and child of his desire. To him from whom she sprang, she flies for aid, Her gentle frame less mix'd with native fire; Therefore the fire of love was given, to heat Her milkiness of kind, and make her all complete. So, without woman, man yet kindred were To savage beasts, and war his sole employ: But woman bade the spirit of peace appear, And won the brutal mind to love and joy. Then let a wife be to thy bosom press'd. In wedded life alone is man supremely blest. FROM OSSIAN'S “BERRATHON.” “Bend thy blue course, oh stream! round the narrow plain of Lutha!” Oh flow round Lutha's narrow plain, sweet stream, And let the wild woods hanging o'er thee wave, And let the sun there shed his warmest gleam, And light winds gently breathe o'er Ossian's grave! At early morn the hunter passing by No more shall hear my harp's harmonious fall; Then shall he drop the tender tear, and cry “Where is the tuneful son of great Fingal?” O come, Malvina! all thy music yield! Let thy soft song once more delight my breast! Then raise my tomb in Lutha's narrow field, And lull my dying spirits into rest. Where art thou, lovely maid? Where is thy song? Where are the soft sounds of thy passing feet? Thou canst not come, nor shall I call thee long, Till in my father's airy halls we meet. Oh pleasant be thy rest, thou lovely beam! Silent and slow thy peaceful light declined: Like the pale moon upon the trembling stream, Soon hast thou set, and left us dark behind. We sit around the rock—but there no more Thy voice remains to soothe, thy light to cheer: Soon hast thou set on this deserted shore, And left us all in gloomy darkness here! SONG. “MORVA RHUDDLAN.” 'Twas at the time when the white thorn was blowing, When pleasant and fruitful the early dews fell, That to the wars as my Owen was going, He stay'd one sad moment to bid me farewell. But, O the marshes, the marshes of Rhuddlan! —He knew not, for ever he bade me farewell. Sad was our parting, and bitter tears falling Shew'd hearts full of sorrow and bursting with love; But a brave soldier, whom honour is calling, No sorrow can soften, no passion can move. Yet, before eve, on the salt marsh of Rhuddlan, In anguish he thought on the tears of his love. Fair smiled the morn; but no joy to my bosom Could all the gay livery of nature afford: Fresh was the breeze that blew over the blossom; My heart, it was heavy because of my lord. And, when night fell o'er the marshes of Rhuddlan, In dreams I beheld it—the form of my lord. Dark rose the morning, and winds loudly blowing Had chased from my pillow the visions of sleep; I sat at my window, and thought of my Owen; I strove to be cheerful, but only could weep. For something had said, On the marshes of Rhuddlan Thy Owen is stretch'd in the hero's last sleep. Never shall time put an end to my mourning; E'en winter retiring no joy brings to me: Lovers may hope in the gay spring returning— 'Twas then that I parted, my Owen, from thee! O the green marshes, the marshes of Rhuddlan! I parted for ever, my Owen, from thee! DEVON'S POLY-OLBION. THE FIRST SONG. (A FRAGMENT.) (A portion of the following verses was honoured with a place in a Collection of Poems edited by Joanna Baillie, 1823.) First of Devon's thousand streams, (Beside whose banks no poet dreams, Since to her praise Old Drayton framed His pastoral reed—yet scarcely named,) ? “Where Great Brute first disembarqu'd his wand'ring Trojans, there His offspring (after long expulst the Inner land, When they the Saxon pow'r no longer could withstand) Found refuge in their flight; when Ax and Otrey first Gave these poore soules to drink, opprest with grievous thirst.” (Drayton's Poly-Olbion.) Silver Axe; who, though her course She fetches from a distant source, And Dorset's downs, as on she glides, From fruitful Somerset divides, Yet justly I Devonian name her, And for that nobler province claim her, (No less than Exe, or Western Tamar;) Amongst whose nymphs she's always numb'red, And christens sea-port, burgh, and hundred. The village of Axmouth; the town (which by a grant of King John was constituted a free borough) and hundred of Axminster. From London smoke, and London follies, To Devon's verdant oaks and hollies, As year by year the dog-star leads me, And with sweet thoughts of childhood feeds me, (Those best and purest thoughts that ever Through life's long intermittent fever, Like health-restoring cordials enter, And in our inmost bosom center: Thoughts which for all that wealth, ambition, Wide spreading fame, or proud condition, Can yield to man, I would not barter; —Not even for the George and Garter)— Thee first (sweet nymph,) my eyes salute, Thee last, when autumn's faded fruit Falling in lap of sad November, Bids me the waning months remember, And leave the country's tranquil joys For eager crowds, and wrangling noise. Hail, modest streamlet! on whose bank No willows grow, nor osiers dank; Whose waters form no stagnant pool, But ever sparkling, pure, and cool, Their snaky channel keep, between Soft swelling hills of tender green, That freshens still, as they descend In gradual slope of graceful bend, And in the living emerald end— On whose soft turf supinely laid Beneath the spreading beechen shade, I trace, in Fancy's waking dream, The current of thine infant stream, Where straggling on with gentle force, Thy waves pursue their destined course. Then crowd upon my mental gaze Dim visions of the elder days. Shrouded in black Cistercian cowl, “Thorncombe was given by William the Conqueror to Baldwin de Sap (or de Brioniis) who had married his niece, Albreda. Richard, Baron of Oakhampton, (son of Baldwin,) founded a monastery of the Cistercian order at Brightley, in the parish of Oakhampton, in the year 1133, which, a few years afterwards, was removed by his sister, and heiress, Adela, (called also Adeliza,) to a place called Ford in this parish (of Thorncombe). The history of the foundation states, that this noble lady, in the year 1138, met the abbot and monks passing through her manor of Thorncombe on their return to the abbey of Waverley, in Surrey, (to which they had originally belonged,) from the barren spot at Brightley, which they had been obliged to quit from poverty and scarcity of provision; and that, moved with compassion, she gave them her manor-house of Ford for their residence, and the manor of Thorncombe for their support.” —Lysons's Devonshire, p. 501. They pass like spectres o'er my soul, On each pale cheek, and furrow'd brow Impress'd the wretched exile's woe, While many a sigh recalls with pain, The distant home they hope to gain Once more, and rest in peace—in vain! Poor wanderers, ye shall never see The wept-for towers of Waverley, Nor with enamour'd sense inhale The sweets of Surry's cultured vale; Whence, at Fitz-Baldwin's high command, Ye sallied, (a devoted band,) To plant the Cross in savage land; Where, free from all restraints of law, The darkling tribes of infant Taw, And rocky Ockment, roam'd secure In the wild franchise of the moor. —A feverish space, 'twixt life and death, The pious planters gasp'd for breath: At length resign'd in mute despair The thankless objects of their care, To moulder left their lowly cell For ever—and without farewell— And, sick at heart, with watchings worn, With failing limbs, and minds forlorn, Hopeless they sought the distant bourn They scarce could dream to reach again— Then laid them down in reckless pain, And watch'd, sweet Axe, thy murm'ring tide Of waters, as they gently glide In rapid silence to the sea, Fit emblem of eternity. But pious Adeliza there, (The conqueror's kin, and baldwin's heir, Fair Devon's countess, rich as fair, And more than fair or rich, devout,) Beheld them on their homeward rout, With liberal hand relieved their woes— And Ford's majestic abbey rose. Age after age since then has roll'd O'er generations dead and cold, From sire to son twice ten-times told— Nor of that grey time-honour'd pile Can one poor stone, in tower or aisle, Of cloister'd walk, or 'battled wall, Or oriel bower, or lordly hall, (Though the thick clustering ivy dwells Imbedded midst the low-roof'd cells, As if its aged trunk had grown Coeval with the native stone, Ere yet the builder's art was known,) Say to the fond exploring eye That fain would read its history, “Avert your touch profane—forbear! The Royal Foundress placed me here.” Yet flows—and will flow on for ever— The current of that peaceful river; While priest and monk have past away, And sable cowl, and amice grey, And 'broider'd cope, with jewels' shine, High rood, and consecrated shrine. In dust the holy relics lie— The hands that rifled them, hard by— The mitred abbot dispossess'd; The leveller with his ribald jest; The courtier, At the suppression, the manor was granted to the Earl of Oxford—the site of the abbey to Richard Pollard, esq. From him the latter passed through various hands till it was purchased by Sir Edmund Prideaux, solicitor-general to the Commonwealth. whose inglorious toil Achieved the glittering Romish spoil; The wily lawyer's subtle craft, That temper'd the destructive shaft, Which kept its destined aim, conceal'd Behind Religion's frowning shield, The work of reformation ended, And in one common ruin blended All holy and all hallow'd things, Altars and thrones, and priests and kings. —The solemn pageant pass'd away, Where next (sweet river,) shall we stray? To Wycroft's bridge, and mouldering wall, That faintly marks the embattled hall By lordly Cobham once possest, And trod by high and princely guest. The manor of Wycroft passed by sale to Sir Thomas Brooke, ancestor of the Lords Cobham. In 1426, a licence was granted to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and others, (trustees, probably, for the Brooke family,) to castellate the mansion at Wycroft, and enclose a park of 800 acres. In Thorncombe's aisle you still may trace The features of a gentle face (Of knight's degree, and Cobham's race,) Glorious in brass, and by his side The image of his lady bride, And character'd in letters fair, “Thomas Brooke, Knyghte,” engraven there: No more remains—the when,—the where,— The how he lived, and fought, and died, Or who the lady at his side, The brass has long forgot to tell, Nor can the keen explorer spell With all his pains, the smallest trace Of the short pious prayer for grace, That ends the monumental scroll,— “The Lord have mercy on his soul.” Yet to the heart it teaches more Than tomes of theologic lore; —A proverb, or grave homily, Of most sententious brevity On mortal durability— Such wisdom is in crumbled bones! Such are the sermons proach'd by stones! Let but a few short lustres pass— The tablet of recording brass (Raised for eternity,) may show, No more than he who sleeps below,— Nay—e'en his feeble fleshly form, Spite of corruption and the worm, Outlast, within its bed of earth, The pompous verse that boasts its worth: So hard the pious taste to save One plank from time's o'erwhelming wave; But would we trace his earlier stream, “'Tis all a cloud, 'tis all a dream!” The Druid walked yon stone-girt round, The Roman rear'd yon grassy mound; This for defence—a chosen site— That for observance, day or night, Of hallow'd or unhallow'd rite. Clear as the sun—Nay, all agree— —Even so, sage dreamer, let it be! Why then wear life's brief candle out In proving that which none can doubt? Why with such dread suspicion eye The grey-beard swain who passes by, As if a word his tongue might say, Would puff your theory away? Well may you dread that rustic smile, “He minds the bigging” See Walter Scott's “Antiquary.” of the pile. Yet may we trust without a crime The legends of the olden time, And still pursue, by croft and mill, Deep vale, and gently sloping hill, (Sweet Axe!) the mazes of thy rill, To plains which, long ere Ford was known, And Newenham's sister abbey shone Transcendent with the blessed rood, Blush'd crimson deep, with Danish blood. In 937 is said to have happened, near Axminster, the most bloody conflict which had ever been known in England, between King Athelstan (accompanied by his brother Edmund,) and the Kings of Ireland and Scotland confederated with the Danes; in which Athelstan was victorious. In the old chronicle which relates it, the slaughter is described as immense; five of the leaders slain are there called kings; these, with eight earls, and others, are said to have been buried in the cemetery at Axminster. Lo! from the bosom of the deep, The sea kings swift ascending sweep! From Seaton's cliffs they wind their way, (Old Moridunum's doubted bay,) “The site of Moridunum is so difficult to determine,” (observes the Bishop of Cloyne in his observations on Roman Stations in Devonshire, incorporated by Lysons in his History,) “that our best antiquaries have doubts on the subject.” Some fix it at Eggardon in Dorsetshire, others at Hembury, but the common opinion is in favour of Seaton. Why not Musbury—two miles above Seaton, on the opposite side of the river—where are evident traces of a Roman camp, and the modern name may be considered as a corruption of the ancient? The point of distance, which is insisted on by the advocates of Hembury fort, does not appear to me very conclusive. The fifteen miles may have been computed from the mouth of the river—the port of Isca. Moridunum—Morisbury—Morsbury—Musbury. The boding raven in their van, To meet undaunted Athelstan. Nor Erin's lonely harp, that day, Nor Scotia's Royal Lion may Be absent from the bloody fray. Dream they of conquest, or of spoil— Fit guerdon of the warrior's toil? Do they for fame or plunder burn? Ah, destined never to return! For Royal Athelstan is there, And Edmund, with the yellow hair, The dangers of the field to share; And with their standard follow free The flower of England's chivalry. With such a foe 'tis vain to cope; From such a foe 'tis vain to hope Whether to win the field or flee— Alike escape and victory. —'Tis done—and on the battle plain Five kings and eight stout earls lie slain; Nor stone is raised, nor mound, to tell They bravely fought, or nobly fell. But they who for their country bled, “King Athelstan gave the church of Axminster to seven priests, who were to pray for the souls of seven knights or earls, and many others, slain in the battle with the Danes near this town.” —Lysons, p. 24. For them their country's tears are shed. Shrined in their parent soil they sleep; There holy priests their vigils keep, And altars burn, and prayers arise In swelling anthems to the skies, From full-toned choirs, for their repose. —Such honours grateful England owes, And such be ever duly paid To her loved patriot's peaceful shade. —Are yonder straggling orchard wall, And yon dark ivied window all— All that unpitying Time has spared Of that illustrious fabrick, rear'd And consecrate to Heaven above, In union of fraternal love? And has destruction seized so soon The saintly labours of Mohun? “The abbey of Newenham in this parish (Axminster) was founded for monks of the Cistercian order, in the reign of Henry III., by Reginald de Mohun, and his younger brother William.”—“There are scarcely any remains of the monastic building, some of which were pulled down a few years ago.” —Lysons, p. 22. —Leave we the clouds of antient story, For scenes of later parted glory. —When scarce a river flows unsung, Or murmuring brook but hath its tongue To praise whate'er of great or good Beside its sacred banks hath stood, Shall Marlborough's native current Ash, in the parish of Musbury, was the chief seat of the family of Drake for many generations. This house is celebrated as having been the birth-place of John Churchill, the great Duke of Marlborough. He was born on Midsummer day, 1650, his mother being then on a visit to her father Sir John Drake. It is now occupied as a farm-house, one wing only of the original edifice, and the chapel (now used as a barn, and detached from the residence) being left. keep Its channel to the ocean deep, Unhonour'd by one tuneful voice, That may his mighty ghost rejoice? No—through the dazzling radiance shed By conquest round his laurel'd head, Let him in dim perspective see The tender scenes of infancy Reflected by the muse's art,— Then feel the welcome tear-drop start, Richer than all the jewels set In his bright princely coronet. —Dismantled now the courts and void, The goodly fabric half-destroy'd, And at the hospitable hearth, Once echoing to the festive mirth Of knight and squire, carousing round The board their morning sport had crown'd; Or to the tabor's merrier sound, When Father Christmas to the door, Call'd young and old, and rich and poor, And stately dame, and blushing maid, (Despite of velvet and brocade, Though guarded by the encircling pale Of stomacher and farthingale,) Would, for the season, lay aside Their full-blown dignity and pride, And join the dance, with honest glee “In unreproved pleasures free;” Unmindful of the waste of years, The goodwife plies her household cares, Or marks the embers, as they burn, To greet the farmer's late return. Yet still you may distinguish, o'er Yon desecrated chapel's door, Display'd the coil'd and wingéd snake, That figures forth the name of Drake; The arms of Drake (still visible over the door of the chapel,) are thus emblazoned: “Argent, a wivern (or winged dragon, probably allusive to the name of Drake,) with wings displayed, gules.” “About this time it was (says Prince in his Worthies, Art. Sir Bernard Drake, knt.) that there fell out a contest between Sir Bernard and the immortal Sir Francis Drake; chiefly occasioned by Sir Francis his assuming Sir Bernard's coat of arms, not being able to make out his descent from his family; (a matter, in those days, when the court of honor was in more honor, not so easily digested.) The feud hereupon increased to that degree, that Sir Bernard, being a person of a high spirit, gave Sir Francis a box on the ear; and that within the verge of the court. For which offence be incurred her majesty's displeasure; and, most probably, it proved the occasion of the queen's bestowing upon Sir Francis Drake a new coat, of everlasting honour to himself and his posterity for ever; which hath relation to that glorious action of his, the circumnavigating the world; which is thus emblazoned by Guillim, (Diamond, a fess wavy between the two pole-stars, Arctic and Antarctic, Pearl,)—and, what is more, his crest is, A ship on a globe under ruff, held by a cable rope, with a hand out of the clouds; in the rigging whereof is hung up by the heels a wivern gules, Sir Bernard's arms; but in no great honour (we may think,) to that knight, though so designed to Sir Francis. Unto all which Sir Bernard boldly replied, “That though her majesty could give him a nobler, she could not give him an antienter coat than his.” With daring crest, and scaly hide, Such as Sir Bernard's ill-starr'd pride, In pomp of heraldry, denied To a far greater Drake, whose fame Outshone the herald's loftiest claim. —Not as the maiden queen, in scorn Of ancestry, would have it borne By her great captain, wise as brave, (When for his proud device, she gave The ship that bore him o'er the wave,) On 'scutcheon downward hung, and fast Suspended to the boastful mast.— —Now to old Ocean's hollow cave Axe pours a wider, deeper wave, Swoln by a thousand nameless rills, Fast trickling from the western hills, That with their woody summits crown Old Colyton's baronial town, And Colcombe's walls with ivy dark, And Shute's grey towers, and mossy park— —No longer now defiance breathing, Colcombe Castle, and Shute House and Park, both of which were (in the time of Elizabeth,) purchased by Sir William Pole, the antiquary, and have ever since descended in his family, belonged (at the commencement of the wars of the two Roses,) the one to Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire, (a zealous Lancastrian,) the other to William Lord Bonville, (an equally strenuous adherent of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York). “In 33 Hen. 6 (says Prince,) there fell out a shrewd dispute between Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire, and this Lord Bonvil, about a couple of hounds; which could by no mediation of friends be qualified or appeased, untill it was valiantly tryed by a single combat on Clyst Heath, near Exeter, wherein (as Dugdale tells us,) this lord prevailed. But another writer saith, that after they had well tryed one the other's strength and valour with their naked swords, they at last lovingly agreed, and embraced each other, and ever after continued in great love and amity.” It seems, however, that a very different account of this transaction is nearer the truth. “During the civil wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, this county was much divided; and, although we have no record of any battle fought in it, yet it appears that bloodshed sometimes ensued between the partisans of the two houses. The roll of parliament, 1455, speaks of several riots and murders committed in the west by these noblemen. Some writers mention a duel between them on Clyst Heath. It was rather a combat, for they fought attended by numerous retainers, who engaged in the conflict; and several persons were killed on either side. Lord Bonville was victorious, and the gates of Exeter were opened to him and his party.” —Lysons, p. viii. I have adopted this historical statement, in its largest signification, as affording an opportunity for introducing a list of the Devonshire worthies of the period, distinguished, (for the most part,) by their various armorial bearings. As when stout Devon's earl, unsheathing His sword in sainted Henry's right, Challenged fierce Bonville to the fight (Plantagenet's redoubted knight). —This is no dream. I see them yet, As when on Clyst's brown heath they met Radiant in arms, and, with them set In meet array, on either side (As sway'd by favor, or allied In kindred ties of blood and name.) All Devon's worthies crowding came, Eager to try the desperate game. Alike regardless of the cause, Each for his feudal chieftain draws The ready glaive, content to share With him the toils, and meed of war, And leave the schoolmen to debate Those knottier subtleties of state, Whether the red rose, or the white, The king in fact, or king by right, “The king in fact, or king by right.” The distinction between a king de facto and a king de jure, which was first known in law at this period, and the scholastic as well as political disputes to which that distinction gave birth, are familiar to historical readers. Holds heaven's commission in the fight. —Fry speeds from Yarty to the field, Three snow-white coursers plain reveal'd Are charging on his crimson shield. Brooke from his castellated roof Brings the crown'd Lion to the proof. Ash, with the double chevron draws His trusty sword in Courtenay's cause, And Pine (whose name is spelt aright By the three pine-cones, golden bright,) For Bonville proves a kinsman's might. From Branscombe's wild and lonely beach, Resounding to the sea-bird's screech, Two warriors mark, ascending slow. On ruby shield the rose of snow Speaks gentle Wadham: while from far, Three sever'd heads, (stern spoils of war,) The fame of Holcombe's line declare. —From where swift Otter's streams divide, And in their parted channel glide, Rejoicing as they wander on Through the rich vale of Honiton, Yon sun-bright banner, broad display'd, Advancing from the distant glade, In stately march, unfurls to view The sable lions of Carew. The principal seat of the noble family of Carew was (at this period,) at Mohun's Ottery, near Honiton. Their arms are, “Or, three lions passant, sable.” Nicholas Baron Carew was the son of Sir Thomas Carew, captain of Harfleur (a distinguished actor in Harry the Fifth's wars,) by a daughter of Sir William Bonville; from whence it might be inferred that he was of the York faction, unless his own marriage with the daughter and heir of Sir Hugh Courtenay, of Haccombe, should lead to an opposite conclusion. His being found, in 1469, in company with the Lords Fitzwarren and Dinham, at Exeter, when that city was besieged by Hugh, Earl of Devonshire, (son and successor of Earl Thomas,) seems, however, to confirm the former supposition. Who follows in the Baron's train? Malherbe, whose courage free from stain (As by his bearing he would shew,) Yields “stinging nettles” to the foe. “Yield stinging nettles to mine enemy.” Shaksp. K. Rich. II. The singular device of Malherbe of Feniton—in evident allusion to his name. In order next you may behold Rich Beaumont, with his bars of gold; Then, by his silver chaplets known, Time-honour'd Duke of Otterton; And last, not least in the career, The blazing sun of bold St. Cleer. Nor backward in the martial list Were found that day, the men of Clyst— Unlike their parent streams, that sleep, As through the fattening meads they creep In lazy silence to the deep. Fraunceis was there, from Fraunceis-Court, Frankcheyney, Bampfylde, Valletort, There Beavis shakes the quivering lance, Like his old name-sake of romance, And by his knightly bearing shows The fabled stock whereon he grows— (Three helmets with the beavers down,)— There Faringdon, whose name makes known The pleasant place that sent him forth To signalize his gentle birth. And oh! may this degenerate tongue Cleave to my throat, if e'er unsung (Loved Faringdon!) I pass thee by, Nor pay the tribute of a sigh, To scenes of early joys and cares, (View'd thro' the softening mist of years, When life was young, and pleasures new,) From grateful memory ever due. —But see! from Hemyock's stately towers Lord Dinham leads his border-powers. John, Lord Dinham, (Lord High Treasurer of England, anno 1 Hen. VII.) was a zealous Yorkist, and personally attached to the Earl of March, afterwards Edward the Fourth, whom (together with his famous adherents Salisbury and Warwick,) he concealed in his house, at Nutwell near Lympstone, (now Sir Thomas Drake's,) when, after the battle of Bloreheath, (ann. 1459,) the Yorkists were dispersed, and that prince took refuge at Calais. The Dinhams had, if not the most extensive, probably the most widely scattered possessions, of any family belonging to Devonshire at this period. Nutwell appears to have been, at this time, their ordinary residence; but Hemyock Castle (on the borders of Somersetshire,) also belonged to them; and I have placed him here accordingly, as at the head of “the men of Culm.” The origin of the family is derived from the Castle of Dinant in Britanny. Oliver de Dinant was Lord of Hartland in the time of the Conqueror; and to his descendant Geoffrey de Dinant (temp. Hen. II.) is ascribed the second foundation of Hartland Abbey. High-raised above the circling press, Four lozenges conjoin'd in fess, (Ermine, on bright vermillion coat,) His old Armoric race denote— Welcome to York's ascending star, No less than when from adverse war To Nutwell's brown o'er-arching shade The royal exile he convey'd, And thence in secret safety bore To Gallia's hospitable shore. Ere half the promised song is sung, My voice is check'd, my harp unstrung. The knightly vision melts away, Of glittering arms and banners gay; Imagination quits her throne; The winged fancies all have flown, And left the field to noise and strife, The dull realities of life. Farewell, my muse! another day We may resume our pleasant play; But now (although it grieve my heart,) 'Tis time that thou and I should part. Farewell, my muse! another year Will soon speed on in swift career: Dark winter's fogs will soon take wing, And fly before the laughing spring; Soon bright-eyed summer pass—and soon Brown autumn with his harvest-moon Return—and we will loiter then 'Mongst Devon's river-nymphs again. And is it thus our idle rhyme Would urge the flying wheels of time? And dare we thus, (infirm of will,) In blind anticipation still Of some imagined hour, unknown, Lose that which only is our own? Farewell, my muse! another day Will bring such leisure as it may— That's not for you or me to say. All is, though we're no longer young As when we first together sung; Though Time has check'd your wanton flow, And plac'd some wrinkles on my brow; We are not yet too old to sport Where Mirth and Fancy keep their court. And so, my farewell I repeat, Not as if doom'd no more to meet, Yet dwelling on the unwelcome word Like some fond lover, who has heard The well-known signal to be gone, And still looks back, and lingers on, Afraid to strike the note of sorrow, Though hoping to return to-morrow. EARLY OCCASIONAL VERSES. TO MY MOTHER, ON HER BIRTH-DAY. (WRITTEN FROM COLLEGE, MARCH 16, 1797.) The snows dissolve—the frost retires, And loosens each rejoicing stream; Fresh youth the new-born year inspires, Nursed by the sun's enlivening beam. All nature feels return of spring; With the sweet lark's seraphic lay Again the vocal woodlands ring— Again their tuneful homage pay. In verdant robe the meads are drest— E'en Camus feels the general joy, Reflecting from his silver breast Each varied hue that decks the sky. All—all to fill my glowing breast With love and gratitude conspire; But this thy day—of days most blest— Awakes my soul to holier fire; Adds livelier charms to all I view, New blossoms to the bursting wood, To every mead a brighter hue, And purer crystal to the flood. Not truer bliss the hour bestows Amid those scenes which fancy loves, Where native Isca murmuring flows Beside our Cowley's infant groves, Than in these walls to science dear, These bowers renown'd in classic song, Where willowy Camus lingering near, In placid stillness creeps along. O thou, who at this genial hour Life's strange eventful course began, Who train'd my soul by Virtue's power, And guided all my steps to man! If I should e'er unworthy prove Of all thy fond maternal care, Yet could I never cease to love, E'en in the depths of dark despair. But brighter hopes my fancy rouse; Far different dreams of bliss refined, Make answer to my ardent vows, And gladden my prophetic mind. In times far hence, when circling years Shall with fresh wreaths thy temples shade, May'st thou behold in me thy fears Averted, and thy cares repaid! Revered, till virtue low is laid, Beloved, till love delights no more, Till all life's kindling raptures fade, And all its earthly joys are o'er. ON BEAUTY. And can a look, a smile, control The warm emotions of the soul? A sigh, a glance, a tear, convey The unresisting heart away? And can a power which knows to bend The laws of nature to its end, To ride secure in air, to breathe Old ocean's liquid vaults beneath, The eternal arch of heaven to scan, And all the mighty maze of man, Yield to a cheek in roses drest, A coral lip, or ivory breast? No—'tis the mind I love—the mind, Where virtue's purest thoughts are 'shrined— Firm faith—untainted modesty— Meek hope—and sainted charity. But when we see each mental grace Glow in the radiance of the face; An angel's purity confess'd In the bright cheek and snowy breast; The speaking lustre of the eye Beam hope and sainted charity; Each sigh, each tear, each glance, impart The faithful records of the heart; 'Tis then, while Beauty's force we prove, A crime to gaze, and not to love. SONNET ON HEARING THE VESPER SONG IN THE CHAPEL AT HENGRAVE. There is a wild and solitary heath On whose brown bosom spring no flowers has shed. There no green hill uplifts his smiling head, Sheltering the calm, well water'd vale beneath; But all is one flat, dark, uncultured waste. Near to that savage spot I heard a strain More ravishing than that which did detain Gay Comus and his wassailers, when they traced Their nightly revels in the wild wood's shade; More mournful than the notes that Zephyr bore, Faint murmuring, along the Danish shore, Pour'd forth unconscious by the sinking maid. That heavenly strain devotion taught to pour, And fancy gave it inspiration's aid. THE WILLING DETENTION. “The night is dark; and thick arise The mist and fog on every side; The roads are heavy, and your eyes Will find no land-mark, near or wide.” “Oh! when the first half mile is over, The road is strait, and plain to see: Our steeds will soon the way discover, And we shall jog home merrily.” “Our common's wild—our common's wide; And some part brake, and some part fen, By ditches cross'd on every side: You'll never find your way agen. Then there's no polar star to guide you— You cannot see St. Ives's light: I fear some mischief will betide you: Cross not our common, then, to-night!” I yield me to the sweet command, And, under thy protecting wing, Defy all harm, all fear withstand— But ruin drink at pleasure's spring. Far safer in the brake and fen, To wander on till break of morning— I then had found my way again In spite of thy prophetic warning. Now from that tongue more pain I've found Than wind or water could impart: Those eyes have made a deeper wound Than could the fen-fiend's icy dart: Yet would I not the bliss resign In memory's glass again to view thee, For all the peace I once call'd mine, Ere, lovely Imogen, I knew thee. TO MEMORY. Farewell, deceitful Memory! Thy faded form, thy hollow eye No more shall blast my sickening view. To thy half joys and chequer'd fears, Thy bitter frown, and smile of tears, Alike I bid adieu. My soul on Lethe's bank hath stood, And drunk of that reviving flood. To a new life awake, I scorn The crowd that shuns the untasted streams, And, tossing still mid feverish dreams, Fail to salute the morn. The hours in pleasure that have pass'd, Remember'd, pall upon the taste, And raise disgust, or discontent. Idly we note, with proud remorse, The imputed errors of our course, And mourn our time mispent. Memory, farewell! before me shine Forms fairer and more fresh than thine, Bright hope, and glittering novelty: The trodden vales I leave behind, And borne on fancy's viewless wind, To unsought mountains fly. There shall no stain of ancient dross My renovated soul engross, Or taint the free unsullied air: There all is lovely, all is new; No former sight there meets my view, No former sound my ear. —Vain is the lay, and false the theme— Of Lethe's dull oblivious stream Man may not taste; nor hard his doom: For sober memory yet can pour On the pure mind a boundless store Of ever sweet perfume. In each new realm she bids me see Some spot to waken thoughts of thee, Dear land! where first I wept and smiled: In every warbled wood-note there, And murmuring stream, I still shall hear A sister's descant wild. Then shall I think how many a day On Isca's banks I loved to stray With dear companions, absent long; How oft at fancy's twilight hour, Full of the muse, I've woo'd the power, The melting power of song. How blest, if in the various bowl No bitter drop shall sting my soul, Drain'd through the dregs of fell remorse— How blest, if memory shall supply New lights to fix my wandering eye, And regulate my course! TO A LADY, WITH THE “CONTINUATION OF BEATTIE'S MINSTREL.” Hoping thro' fields of fierce forensic war The steep whence fame's proud temple shines afar To gain, no more the humble Minstrel's lay, Though often summon'd, will my call obey. In gayer hours, by fairy visions drest, The muse with rapture fill'd my youthful breast, When health, and peace, and competence my aim, I shrank to hear the obstreperous trump of fame; With Edwin loved to trace the haunted stream, O'er the white torrent gazed in bliss supreme, Hung, mutely joyful, on the mountain's side, Nor knew more transport than those scenes supplied. E'en now, when you my youthful efforts praise, And ask the tribute of my minstrel lays, My random pearls I would again unite, And string a jewel worthy of thy sight. —In vain—the muse, disdainful of my prayer, From her high throne thus thunders in my ear: “Stay thy rash hand! These gems, my special care, None but a true devoted bard may wear; These fields, by Beattie till'd, by Edwin trod, Yield not to rebel feet their sacred sod; This Eden yet some favour'd bard may share— —No flaming sword shall fright Eliza here; But thou!—rebellious to my sovereign sway, Bear thy rude steps and daring hands away! Go, vow submission to the power I hate! Go, swell the suppliants at ambition's gate! Seek the throng'd bar, full wig, and flowing gown, The miry streets and dingy walls of town! And, when thy goddess hides her spurious fires, When law provokes to sleep, and business tires, Put on, to soothe thy spleen, my German bonnet, Write tales of wonder, or some limping sonnet, And think, with earth-born insolence o'er-run, The muse still favours an apostate son!” While such the answer to my humble suit, In vain I gape to catch poetic fruit; Yet when my early love, not yet subdued, Returns to frown upon my solitude, I seek to make a compromise with fate, And think repentance never comes too late. Perhaps ambition may my suit repel, And lofty honour scorn my humble cell; The golden fruit elude my venturous hand, And melt, my vision of the promised land: No sapient coif may light upon my head, No honour'd silk be o'er my shoulders spread. Then, disappointed, jostled, press'd, subdued, While dolts and knaves before my face intrude, Wearied with watchings, and with labour spent, A prey to care and fruitless discontent, May I, to pass my disregarded age, Find out at eve some peaceful hermitage! When true repentance aids my suit, the muse Her humble suppliant may no more refuse, But heal the wounds by foil'd ambition made With balm fresh gather'd in her laurel shade, Teach me to pour again my soul in song With powers more ripen'd, and a voice more strong, Again draw gentle Edwin forth to view, And make the minstrel strain more worthy you. HORACE, BOOK II. ODE 7. TO A FRIEND ON LEAVING COLLEGE. First of my friends, who long with me Hast drain'd the bowl of slavery, Driven to the extreme of toil and gloom In old Mathemon's lecture room; First of my friends, what favouring god Now brings thee safe to Hope's abode? —With whom, our hated cares to drown, I've talk'd the evening shadows down, Or, bursting from our fetters free, Have rush'd to wine and poesy? When fortune fail'd, and courage died, With thee I fled the battle's tide, And, on our rear while Tavel Moderator in 1799. See Cambridge Tripos. hung, Away my blotted buckler flung. The muse received me, spent with care, And wafted to a healthier air, But thee the billows closed around, And bore amidst the vast profound. Now, every toil and trouble o'er, With me the glad libation pour; And let thy weary limbs be laid Beneath the muse's laurell'd shade: Leave musty algebraic rules, And Vince and Waring to the schools; And let the muse returning charm thee, And fancy guide, and pleasure warn thee: So I a new escape shall prove In thy return to joy and love, And feel each gift the muse can send More rich with my recover'd friend. HORACE, BOOK I. ODE 7. PARAPHRASED. Let others praise the meads of Kent, Or steal through “Surrey's quiet lanes;” The charms of Humber or of Trent May swell the rapture of their strains; Or Usk, that gave our Henry birth, Or Avon, nurse of Shakspeare's song, Or the wild consecrated earth Where wanders wizard Dee along. Some love to tune fair Granta's reeds, On which the Athenian goddess breathes, Or press the turf where Isis speeds To crown her sons with classic wreaths. But neither thought of toil-won race, Nor soothing dream of tuneful ease, Can so my bounding spirits brace, Or so my softer moments please, As Isca's swift descending flood, And Creedy's waves that gentler run, And much-loved Cowley's infant wood, And orchards ripening to the sun. Yet, if the viewless storm of fate Should drive me from its sheltering shade, To leave—perhaps no distant date! Each rural walk, and quiet glade— (O might the lot be never mine!) Yet would I bear a tranquil soul, Nor faint, nor murmur, nor repine Whilst there is rest beneath the pole. THE PRAISE OF ISCA. Erewhile, in Richmond's hawthorn bower I rested from the noon-tide fire, There woo'd the long neglected power Of song to wake my idle lyre, And, more my visions to inspire, Though deep yet clear, though gentle, strong, By mead and wood, by cot and spire, Slow roll'd majestic Thames along; But, whilst I traced his winding course From Twit'nam's meads to Fulham's grove, Where late, from dawning beauty's source, I drank delicious draughts of love; Though soul-subduing phantoms strove Imagination to detain, Still would the goddess further rove, And Isca mingle with the strain. When gliding late up Medway's stream, Our bark explored her fountain cells, I thought, while freedom was my dream, (Bright genius of her oak-clad dells,) Proud Kent! though manly vigour swells Thy sons, thy nymphs each maiden grace, Yet freedom too in Devon dwells, And Isca bathes as fair a race. Though Pales sheds her choicest store On gentle Coln and sedgy Lea, Yet Pan himself on Isca's shore Has fix'd his rural sovereignty. While chain'd by Bath's dull pool, yet free My soul, to wander where it chose, Oft stray'd, majestic Thames, to thee, But oftener still where Isca flows. I saw Sabrina's yellow hair, —Sabrina, famed in British song,— Through peopled vales and cities fair Curling its silken tresses long, Wild float, luxuriant meads among; Methought I saw her reed-crown'd head Mid deafening din, with heavings strong, High-raised above its oozy bed. I wander'd on poetic ground, Where Shakspeare's Avon sweetly flows, And woo'd each softly whispering sound That trembled midst his osier rows; I sought the vale of deep repose Where Vaga hoarsely pours her wave, And trod at evening's solemn close Old Tintern's dim religious cave. Yet poets too by Isca dream; Rich meadows kiss her sparkling face, And ancient walls o'erhang her stream, And peopled towns her borders grace: Let all old ocean's vassal race Conspire to check the vaunting strain, So thou thy loyal bard embrace, Maternal stream! their toils are vain. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY. In this dull clime, where smoke and fog conspire To quench each spark of fancy's sacred fire, Where Themis loves sole arbitress to reign, And binds the passions in her leaden chain, How shall the muse, who loves the breezy hill, The tangled forest, and the haunted rill, And there to wander unconstrain'd and free, Alone, unless with peace and liberty, Through the thick mists and dusky air appear, Nor shun, appall'd, a city atmosphere? The gayer hopes that fire the untainted mind, Fly far away upon a healthier wind, And leave a sickly substitute, that feeds On hackney'd precedents of wire-drawn deeds; Imagination, clogg'd and damp'd, can soar Into the blue expanse of heaven no more, Content to calculate expected fees, And swell the crowd of mammon's votaries. Here, as I watch my fire's expiring light, Companion of a lonely, studious night, My discontented thoughts unbidden stray To scenes of social comfort far away; Dreams of the paradise of home intrude Upon the sickening eye of solitude; Forgetful that true Paradise is found On no peculiar spot of hallow'd ground, That, to the mind from lawless passion free, It still is here—at Rome, or Ulubræ. O may my soul keep ever in its view This certain truth—this golden rule pursue! If generous passions ever sway'd my breast, If virtue e'er my youthful mind possess'd, If e'er my heart at noble deeds beat high, Or emulation fired my eager eye; And oh! if e'er the muse had power to raise These lofty musings in my boyish days; Perish the thought that she restrains her aid To the close covert of the sylvan shade! Not to wild woods, or pathless glades confined, Her favourite mansion is the noble mind. Still, still, celestial power, my spirit fire! Cherish each heaven-born thought, each pure desire Teach me to curb my passions—to unite The truest wisdom with the best delight! Inspire my diligence! my longings guide! Restrain my petulance! abase my pride! And when with business tired, my day of toil Uncheer'd at evening by a social smile, The sickening spirit longs for liberty, O may it still find happiness in thee! EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, WHOM THE AUTHOR WAS FORBIDDEN TO VISIT WHILE ON DUTY. In ancient times—so says the muse— At Gela, or at Syracuse, Or somewhere else—no matter where— Where youths are brave, and maidens fair, Where vineyards glow on every plain, And every mountain waves with grain, Where rivers gently flow, and clear, And sunshine gladdens all the year, Where snakes are harmless, wolves polite, And man alone knows how to bite; There lived—the terror of the swains, And spoiler of those lovely plains— A direful beast, which men of old, In their rude phrase, a tyrant call'd, But now, accustom'd to the thing, And grown more courteous, style a king. One evening, as he went his round, This king two faithful lovers found; And, taken with a sudden whim Of love to her, or hate to him— Whether his hat was cock'd awry, Or too much lustre gemm'd her eye, He gave a nod—his guards straitway Poor Damon to a gaol convey. (Sicilian gaols, on recollection, Are like our houses of correction— In the year 1801. When once you're in, 'tis ten to one You never more behold the sun.) The luckless youth, now held in quod, Must call to his relief some god: No man to his complaints attended, The habeas corpus was suspended. In vain the mistress of his love Tried the rude gaoler's heart to move; At length, as at the prison gate The nymph bewail'd her cruel fate, A sudden stiffness seized her limbs; Her head with dizzy vapours swims; And her white garments sweep the floor With rustlings never heard before. Still she renews her amorous woes, But all the plaints her lips disclose, No longer echoed through the town, Stand printed on her paper gown, And there, as fast as she can think, Her thoughts are fetter'd down in ink. Yet, not at once of power bereft, One motion to her lips still left, What should her last faint breath proclaim But her imprison'd Damon's name; Which on her beauteous back engross'd, Forms the direction for the post: Last came the Cyprian dove, and bore her, A billet-doux, to her adorer. In vain the tyrant's bolts are hurl'd, While pens and doves are in the world; And, e'en though doves were wanting, still The post supplies the pigeon's bill. Your master's empty threat may be, “You ne'er a friendly face shall see”— His power is to a threat confined, While you can read a friendly mind. Now let me, if I yet am able, Leave for a while the realms of fable, And lofty regions of romance; (Like our ingenious friends in France, Who, after all their strange vagaries Of freedom in a land of fairies, Have now descended to plain fact, And bear a consul on their back,) To tell you wherefore I lay by My tomes of law and history, A few brief hours to kill, or spend In scribbling nonsense to a friend. The other evening, sick of smoke, And less disposed to read than joke, —The sun that glitter'd on the trees, The birds that caroll'd on the breeze, (Though stunted these, imprison'd those) The powers of fancy bore along, And lured to thoughts of soft repose, And all the dreams of rural song. The king of rivers too was near: —I took a barge from Westminster. With gentle breeze and favouring tide, Up the sweet stream we smoothly glide; The swelling bosom of our sail Freely receives the wooing gale, And, as the spires behind recede, The pendant wood, the verdant mead, The palace soaring o'er the grove, The low retreat of peace and love, The prospect, soothing past expression, Of towers and trees in swift succession, The purple hills that gently rise Athwart the glowing western skies, And (chief) the monarch of the scene, Thames, majestic and serene, While the winds with wonder whist Scarce his glassy bosom kiss'd, And evening pour'd his crimson light Upon that mirror calm and bright, Dissolved my every captive sense In soft voluptuous indolence: Unguarded, I no longer strove Against the subtle traitor, love. The god observed my open heart, And seized the vulnerable part. He turn'd my eyes on Fulham's wood That darkly overhangs the flood; Bad me on days long past reflect, When love was new, and hope uncheck'd, And she, of Fulham's grove the queen, Gave life to all the lovely scene. Again I gazed—the view no more Was bright with rapture as before; The woods were black; the wind was cold; Dim vapours o'er the landscape roll'd; The banks were swamps—on every side The pamper'd city rear'd its pride; E'en Thames no longer shew'd so fair, His waters dull, his margent bare. Sadly my bark I homeward turn'd, But Thames, ill brooking that I spurn'd The glories of his burnish'd throne, Or prized not for themselves alone, Call'd up, to seal my wretched doom, The ministers of cold and rheum. Raw blew the blast against the tide, My labouring oars incessant plied; Thick vapours loaded every gale, And useless lay the flagging sail. Hence, at the river god's behest, A noxious sprite my frame possess'd, Who holds with men eternal war Through this fair isle—by name, catarrh; And hence, debarr'd from outer day, Like you, I own tyrannic sway; Like you immured, (Cætera desunt.) EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, WHO HAD COMPLAINED OF THE AUTHOR FOR WITHDRAWING HIMSELF FROM SOCIAL ENJOYMENTS. Well—be it so—my friend, I've done With noise, extravagance, and fun. I fear I've pass'd the fatal line— That uncheck'd mirth, and unstopp'd wine, The flow of wit that knows no bound, The merry laugh's perpetual round, Nay—e'en the social generous glow That all-enlivening grapes bestow, —Joys that, a few brief se'nnights past, I thought eternally would last, Or fondly wish'd, before they fled, I might be number'd with the dead— No more are trick'd with charms for me, Nor wake my soul to jollity; That, if to pleasure I incline, No more I view her form in wine, Nor, if bleak care besets my soul, Can drown him in the sparkling bowl. Farewell! farewell, delusive dream! —The joy of youth—the poet's theme— Enchanting scenes of mirth and glee, Where all was gay, and all was free, Where infant love's first sparks were fann'd, Cemented friendship's strictest band, And both together bore along, In union sweet, the power of song! Enchanting scenes, that fancy loves, That friendship's sacred voice approves, On which remembrance oft shall dwell With sad delight—dear scenes, farewell! Even so—I've pass'd the fatal line, And other suns upon me shine; But, as the home-sick sailor sees 'Mid the waste waves his native trees, And thinks the wide-stretch'd watery scene Fair meadows clad in vernal green, So oft my fancy turns to view Those forms my livelier moments knew, And, kindling at delusions vain, Believes and hopes them back again: Then, if I court their imaged charms, My fever'd soul is up in arms, And sickening nature proves at last The passion weak, the moment past. Yet, oh the vile reproach disclaim That stamp'd “Unfriendly” on my name, And cease to think a friend untrue Because he shuns to drink with you. Though now imperious o'er my soul Love reigns, and wars without control, If e'er a friend I've valued less, Shared not his joys, or his distress, Or felt unkindness easier smart, Than when I still possess'd my heart, May all my hopes of bliss decay, And dark despair o'ercloud my day! And you, if e'er, for mirth unfit, Or tired with wine, or cloy'd with wit, You wish a sober hour to pass, Enliven'd by a temperate glass, And sacred to the powers of rhyme, Or mightier muse of ancient time, Remember there is one whose heart In friendship ever bears a part, And think you may that friendship share, Unmingled with the name of “Hair!” For an explanation of this cant phrase—??????? ??????????—see Hodgson's Juvenal, satire 16: “Worthy of all the Hair of ancient days,” together with the note on the passage. ELEGIAC STANZAS. Life was not made to flow in smooth delight, Nor to be lost in unavailing sorrow. It is a chequer'd scene of black and white; The cloud scarce form'd to-day may burst tomorrow. It is for action given, for mental force, For deeds of energetic hardihood. There is no time for sighing and remorse; There is no room for selfish solitude. There's not a day doth pass but teems with fate; No fleeting hour, but alteration brings: O'er this, our perishable mortal state Variety for ever waves her wings. Then let not mortal man of change complain— Of change, that governs our sublunar sphere; Nor waste in fond regret, and listless pain, The hours assign'd to generous action here. The joys of lawless youth perhaps are fled. The glass brisk circling, and the jovial song, The careless heart, the wild fantastic head, That to the early burst of life belong, No more are ours. With these have haply flown Some cherish'd visions, yet more closely twined, Which hope delusive fondly call'd her own, And fate unpitying claims to be resign'd. What though their day be o'er, ambition glows With fiercer heat in our meridian age; Honour remains, the foe to dull repose, And points a hard, but glorious pilgrimage. ANSWER TO A CHARGE OF INCONSTANCY. O not that I am faithless say, Or that my love's no more the same, If Cynthia once inspired my lay, And then Licymnia lit the flame. One goddess only I adore, Although in different forms I woo her; Nor, though she bid me love no more, Could I be e'er inconstant to her. The sailor, midst the dangerous main, Full many a lovely region sees, Fair islands, bright with golden grain, And rich with ever blooming trees; But, till the destined port he gains, Those transient charms he little prizes, And quits with joy the happiest plains Soon as a favouring gale arises. My fancy had a mistress drawn, And stamp'd her image on my heart; I roved o'er hill and vale and lawn, But ne'er could find the counterpart: This had the form, the air, the face, That, the sweet smile's bewitching beauty, And every singly winning grace Fix'd for the time my wandering duty. But now 'tis sped—my fancy's flight: All former trivial, vain desires, Like spectres fade before the light, Or perish in sublimer fires. He needs not fear again to fall Before the shadow of perfection, Who for the bright original Has dared avow his soul's election. LYRIC STANZAS. Ah! what is life, with all its joys And sorrows that disturb us so? The thunder's peal, with startling noise, That for a moment shakes the skies, And then—no more its path we know. Ah! what is pleasure? what is power, Fame, learning, honour, riches, praise? The glittering vision of an hour, The rainbow of a summer's shower, That passes from us while we gaze. And what is love—our hope and stay— The soft enchanter of our dreams? 'Tis but the sunshine's transient ray, That o'er the clouds of life's short day A moment sheds its doubtful gleams. Let me the transient bliss enjoy, Unmindful of hereafter's gloom! I'll view the sunshine of her eye, While yet the fates that light supply, And welcome then the friendly tomb. For if my offering she despise, 'Tis only that the inconstant ray One little instant sooner flies From life's dark cloud that loads our skies; And soon that cloud will pass away. But if my vows she should requite, Will life that fleeting vapour be? Ah no! To my enraptured sight 'Twill beam like heaven's eternal light— And then, farewell, philosophy! LYRIC STANZAS. Why will you fly me when I sue? No fond romantic tale is mine, Such as a maid should scorn to hear: The homage of a bosom true, A flame from love's most holy shrine, Why need it move distrust or fear? No sign of love return'd I seek: A kind approving smile alone, Or only not a frown from thee; Till time my vows sincere shall speak, And thou no longer blush to own A more than sister's care for me. But if (forbid it, heaven!) thy breast Disdain the thought I would impart, Oh, end at once the hopes of mine! My grief shall ne'er disturb your rest, And not a sigh that rends my heart Shall ever damp the joys of thine. FROM PETRARCH. NOV. 1804. “Mie venture al venir son pigre e tarde, La speme incerta, e 'l desio monta e cresce; Onde 'l lassar e l' aspettar m' incresce.” My joys on sluggish pinions move— Hope is uncertain—and desire Mounts on the eager wings of love; Thus, lingering, sickening, I expire. THE WONFORD GHOST. A DEVONSHIRE LEGEND. PARODIED FROM WORDSWORTH'S LYRICAL BALLADS. “At the corner of Wood Street, ere daylight appears.” At an old house in Wonford, ere daylight appears, There's a ghost that has haunted the stair-case nine years. Poor Susan, who lived at the place, loves to tell How the spectre she knew, and remembers it well. 'Tis the ghost of a waggon—she hears it, and sees Twelve horses ascending the stairs on their knees: To the gallows the jingle of bells echoes plain, And the neighings resound throughout Heavitree Lane. It recalls to her mind days of rapture, when John Would send by the waggon, from fair Honitòn, Some Michaelmas fairing—a ribbon or glove, Or a garter—the last, sweetest token of love. From the window she looks; something seems to approach: 'Tis the waggon—Ah no! 'tis the Exeter coach! Again she looks out—'tis the waggon she spies; How swift run the horses!—the dust, how it flies! She looks—and her soul is in heaven—but they fade, These visions of bliss from the poor forlorn maid; No ribbons so flaunting, no garters so gay, For John, he was hang'd at the 'sizes last May. MORAL. Ye damsels, from Susan's sad story beware, How to thieves and housebreakers you offer an ear. When they're hang'd, no more waggons bring fairings from town, But the ghosts of four wheels roll your stairs up and down. ON AN INCIDENT 1811. RELATED IN SOME OF THE PUBLIC PAPERS. PARODY OF SOUTHEY'S “CURSE OF KEHAMA.” “Arvalan! Arvalan! Arvalan! Arvalan!” There is a spot at Drinsey nook Where builds her nest the feather-poke. A mistake of the parodist, proving his culpable ignorance of one branch, at least, of natural history—ornithology. The feather-poke is not the name of the animal, but the nest of the bird called the tom-tit, or tit-mouse. It may be corrected, however, after the following manner: “There is a spot at Drinsey nook Where the tit-mouse builds its feather-poke. In what cave, or in what cell, Lovest thou, little Tit, to dwell?” And again: “And Tom-tit screams, as by fits he looks out,” &amp;c. I am indebted for this correction to the patient and persevering researches of an excellent friend at the British Museum. In what cave, or in what cell, Lovest thou, feather-poke, to dwell? Under Temporell's dead jaw-bone Thou sitt'st and incubatest alone; Where the clanking gibbet chain Swings o'er Gainsborough's houseless plain. The midnight pilgrim, wandering near, Turns aside his head for fear; Yet he hears not human scream nor groan, For speech the senseless corse has none. But the wind hath a voice that sadly moans, And whistles amid the rattling bones; And the feather-poke screams as by fits she looks out, Through the sightless sockets, and fleshless snout. Five years—five little years ago— The murderer was as we are now; And now the small bird sits alone, And incubates under his jaw-bone.— Temporell! Temporell! Temporell! Temporell! The dead jaw-bone of Temporell. FROM LAMENTATIONS. CHAP. I. How desolate and sad She sits, that once with multitudes o'erflow'd! How hangs her widow'd head, Deserted by her sovereign and her God! How want and misery Usurp the place of her fallen majesty! She weeps the whole night long; Upon her pale cheek stands the briny tear: Her lovers' numerous throng No help afford, nor consolation bear; Her treacherous friends are fled, Or turn their arms against her sinking head. Judah is captive borne, And in affliction drags the heavy chain; From all she honour'd torn, Forspent, and lost, she prays for rest in vain. All unforeseen they came Who sought her ruin, and abhorr'd her name. The ways of Zion mourn Her rites neglected, and abandon'd fane; Her reverend priests forlorn, Her maids afflicted, and her children slain; Her enemies are chief, Nor from offended heaven hopes she relief. Her charms are all declined; Her princes perish like the famish'd hart, That can no shelter find, And faint and trembling flies the hunter's dart; And, thinking in her woe Of her past joys, her sorrows heavier grow. THE FORTY-SIXTH PSALM. Our steadfast hope is God; The strength of our abode; Our help in troubles, ever ready found: Therefore we will not fear, Though earth herself uprear From her foundations deep, with direful sound; Though rude rocks thundering from the steep Fall, and increase the horrors of the raging deep; Though ocean's billows break, Till loftiest mountains shake At the rough surge that beat their savage sides; While by the Holy Hill Yet flows a living rill, Gladdening bright Zion with its gentle tides, And in the midst our God doth stand: Therefore it shall endure unmoved, by his command. When as the nations raged, And wars the mighty waged, And all the kingdoms of the wide world shook, Then thunder'd from on high The dreadful Deity, And the globe melted, by his lightnings strook. The Lord of armies is our shield; To us shall Jacob's God his heavenly refuge yield. O tremble at the Lord, Whose all-commanding word Earth's loveliest realms can render desolate; Who biddeth wars to cease, And every land be peace; Who breaks the bow, and makes the sword abate; Who, with his lightning's fearful force, Fires the proud scythéd chariot in its swiftest course. “Be humble, and adore! I am the God, before All other gods whose name is lifted high; Whose everlasting throne Shall through the world be known, The one unseen, unrivall'd Deity!”— The Lord of armies is our shield; To us shall Jacob's God a heavenly refuge yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II ORLANDO IN RONCESVALLES, A POEM, IN FIVE CANTOS. CANTO I. The banner waved on Clermont's highest tower; Forth rode the Count in glittering armour clad: But Aldabelle bewail'd the luckless hour, Alone, amidst the pomp of triumph, sad: From her fair eyes fast fell the pearly shower,— Ah tears ill timed, when all things else were glad! The soul-born pride of female courage slept; Anglante's spouse, the Rose of Clermont, wept. And wherefore falls the pearly shower so fast? And wherefore heaves with frequent sighs her breast? Not so, when War had blown his deadliest blast, The mailed hero to her heart she prest; Then fearless waited, till the storm o'erpast Should give him back to her who loved him best, Safe in the prowess of her conquering lord, And the resistless magic of his sword. “Orlando, stay! last night the sheeted fire Blazed from yon western heaven, in crimson dyed— Orlando, stay! with screeches loud and dire The deadly raven at my casement cried; And, when I woke, the spectre of thy sire, Of Milo, Clermont's lord, was at my side. Orlando, stay! I'm sick and faint at heart, Nor can my soul endure the thought,—to part. “Thou too, my Oliver, my brother, stay! Thou gentlest knight that ever bore a sheild! 'Tis come, alas! that heaven appointed day— Orlando breathless lies on Honour's field. O let thine Aldabelle, thy sister, pray! To female tears 'tis no disgrace to yield: Think on the duties of thy knightly vow, Behold the widow and the orphan now! “Can ye remember Gano's treacherous tongue, His smooth deceits, his unextinguish'd hate? Can ye forget how Malagigi sung The dark presages of approaching fate? The warning words, on Namo's lips that hung, Big with the ruin of the Christian state? What Salamon's sagacious mind foretold? What Britain's valiant King, the wise and old? “In Poictiers' race was friendship ever known? Then trust the tale by base Maganza wrought. Was ever truth on Saragossa's throne? Then throw aside the guard that prudence taught. But, oh Orlando! 'tis to thee alone, The generous soul, and unsuspecting thought: Against thee, in the unequal fight, engage Unfathom'd Fraud, insatiable Rage.” Vain are thy prayers and sighs, fair Aldabelle, Sweet lady, vain;—thy warning who can hear? Bright Hope and Joy thy brother's bosom swell, And plumed Pride, the deadly foe to Fear. But Clermont's lord pronounced one faint farewell, From his dark brow he dash'd one manly tear, Omen of ill!—then cried, “On, soldiers, on!— Long is our journey, and the day far gone.” Their pleasant road through glades and forests lay Of shadowy plane rows, and the stately beech, Beneath whose foliage winds her rapid way Glad Oise, in haste his regal bride to reach. Sweet birds from every thicket caroll'd gay, In melody surpassing human speech; Soft breezes fann'd the air, and curl'd the stream, Melting the soul in love's enchanted dream. I cannot say what amorous thoughts possest The younger Paladin, as on he rode; But, ever and anon, his steed he prest With idle spur; then carelessly bestrode, The reins let loose, and every limb at rest, Just as his active spirits ebb'd and flow'd: Had he in love been constant as in fight, Not all the world could boast a worthier knight. Orlando's heart the soft attemper'd air To different thoughts of graver hue inclined; No vain delusive fires enkindled there, But breathed a solemn stillness o'er his mind, (That mood the gifted sage is said to share When inspiration leaves the sense behind,) Recalling every sigh, and sad farewell, And boding tear of his loved Aldabelle. From the deep trance, that until eventide Still held the knights so diversely enthrall'd, First Oliver awoke, and sportive cried, “How fares my brother? has his mind recall'd Some fearful scene by Merlin prophesied? Or, by Montalban's raven voice appall'd, Thinks he the dreams of female terror true, And half regrets the glory we pursue? “My temper suits not with the gloomy mood Gender'd by woman's tear and beadsman's groan: It ever whispers, Seize the present good, And live in hope, till hope and life are flown. E'en now, to say thee sooth, I inly brood On fancied pleasures near the Moorish throne;— Proud lordships and embattled towers for thee, For me, high dames, and sports and minstrelsy. “Then, with the earliest breeze of balmy morn, The silent Pyrenees shall start to hear The mountain music of my echoing horn; And by my side, dispell'd each maiden fear, The Moorish nymph, to gentler pastimes born, Shall curb the steed and dart the slender spear, While her dark lover, following far behind, May sigh his jealous sorrows to the wind. “She heeds not his rebuke; but, when the hour Of feast and revelry begins its reign, My huntress fair shall sparkling nectar pour For me, for me awake the amorous strain. The banquet's past; and o'er the myrtle bower Night spreads her veil, the fairest bower in Spain; I know not,—but a Christian knight, 'tis said, May haply win the love of Moorish maid.” Thus as he spake, he smiled in merry guise, And Clermont's lord with temperate smile return'd: “Fair cousin, while you speak, our elders wise May wish, full fain, their gravest lore unlearn'd, And ladies, chaste as ice, whose fixed eyes Ne'er stray'd from fancy, nor with passion burn'd, By heaving bosom and warm cheek confess Some hidden sense of undream'd blessedness. “Me would it ill beseem to knit my brow When amorous knights discourse of ladies gay, Or, like a churchman, mutter penance vow When laughing minstrels chaunt the merry lay; The gibing Paladins would ask, Where now Is he who loved the Princess of Cathay, Orlando,—whom Angelica the vain Robb'd of his wits beside the banks of Seine? “And, trust me, Oliver, no dismal tale Of dark foreboding, portent dire and strange, Of shrieking night bird, or of phantom pale, Can the high purpose of my soul derange: Though o'er my mind be cast a transient veil, As passing clouds the summer skies may change, No fears the champion of the Cross can move, Whose confidence is firm in heavenly love.” “Well I believe,” return'd that younger knight, The unshaken firmness of Orlando's soul: For when nor prospect of unequal fight, Nor tempest rattling fierce from pole to pole Had ever power to make thee blench with fright, Oh how should peace array'd in gorgeous stole, The tributary realm and proffer'd throne, But fill thy breast with joy and pride alone?” Thus in free converse pass'd the sultry hours, Till eve descending over hill and vale With dewy fingers closed the drooping flowers: Now fresher perfumes load each passing gale, And sweet birds nestle in their summer bowers, And tunes her throat the wakeful nightingale. The wandering knights some friendly shelter claim With needful sleep to soothe the o'erwearied frame. Anselm, the generous chief of Arli's race It chanced some knightly purpose thither led, At the same hour their frugal board to grace, And share the lord of Clermont's proffer'd bed. So fared the knights of old;—no lack of space To noble spirits in the narrowest shed, While the wide world was all too small to hold The guardian and the plunderer of the fold. In mutual faith, both ask'd, and both declared Their different journey's end: how Charles had sent To king Marsilius messengers prepared To treat, with words of fair arbitrement, That both by Moor and Christian might be shared Once more the joys of peaceable content; How Poictiers' lord the gracious olive bore, And spread the joyful news from shore to shore, Orlando told: nor fail'd he to declare That Saragossa's prince had fix'd the day Whereon to Roncesvaux he would repair In pomp of peace, with suitable array, To meet Anglante's valiant lord, and there Into his hands with honour reconvey The realms erst won by conquering Charlemain From wild Sobrarbe to Ebro's fertile plain. “Thither, at Charles's high behest, I go; And little reck I whether false or sooth Montalban's death-denouncing voice of woe, That bade beware the subtile mask of truth, And hold no reverence for his head of snow Who stain'd with treason the fair page of youth. Fear must not couple with Orlando's name: Whate'er betide, his course is still the same.” Short time the generous Anselm mused, and then— “Now by the faith of former years,” he cried, “The mutual faith we pledged in fair Ardenne, And since in dangerous battle oft have tried, Orlando, if thou dare the lion's den, Thy brother knight shall enter by thy side. Till both return from Roncesvalles free, Loved Arles, adieu! I'll ne'er revisit thee.” Meanwhile, upon his rushy couch reclined, Slept Oliver as on the softest bed; While fancy left the present scenes behind, And dreams delusive throng'd about his head: Now round his brows are rosy chaplets twined, Now gorgeous tapestry for his feet is spread; The storied walls, carved roofs, and inlaid floor, The same that deck'd the courts of Caradore. The banquet rich in royal state is spread, Mid the full blaze of artificial day: The air with music trembles: high o'er head Harmonious minstrels chaunt the jocund lay: Piment and clairet, hypocras and mead, And sparkling cyprus, and the deep tokay, By courteous knights are pledged to blushing maids, While peals of laughter shake the proud arcades. Sudden the feast is vanish'd, hush'd the sound Of minstrelsy, and quench'd the torches' blaze: One solitary taper sheds around A shadowy couch its soft mysterious rays; And on that couch, as if in trance profound, Reclines the enchantress of his later days, Bright as when first with answering fires she burn'd, And vow for vow, and sigh for sigh return'd. “My fondest love, awake!” he seem'd to say— “Meridiana! let those melting eyes Beam on my soul, once more, celestial day— And light the path that leads to Paradise!” They ope, those stars of love; the kindling ray O'er all her frame in swift emotion flies: “My Oliver!”—Enraptured, tranced, possess'd, He hears his murmur'd name—he sinks upon her breast— Upon her panting breast he sinks—but oh! No more it heaves his warm embrace to meet— That breast has ceased to pant, that cheek to glow, Those eyes to sparkle, and that pulse to beat; The form he clasps is cold as statued snow; The couch a bier—the robe a winding sheet— The sounds, faint struggling those pale lips between, “Take thy first bride, thy murder'd Florisene!” With horror wild he bursts the icy chain Of slumber; and, ere yet the cheerful light Purpled the billows of the eastern main, Hath summon'd to the field each brother knight: His alter'd cheer they note, but seek in vain To rouse the extinguish'd genius of delight, Or clear the brow with shades of death o'ercast:— So heavy sits remembrance of the past. Five days they journey on, from morning's break To night, and on the sixth fair evening view The sun-clad Pyrenean's spiry peak, Like some proud banner tinged with golden hue. “Behold,” Orlando cries, “the mark we seek,— How awful, yet how goodly, to the view! Hail we the passing glory, as a sign, Vouchsafed from Heaven, of countenance divine. “But who are they that, from yon forest glade Emerging, hither urge their steeds aright? Full gallant lords they seem, and well array'd, As on their arms faint glows the expiring light.” “If well mine eyes distinguish'd,” Anselm said, “The foremost is, indeed, a gallant knight: Charles cannot boast a worthier in his train.— What! know ye not the far famed British thane?” “Now shame upon mine eyes untimely blind! “It is, it is Astolpho's self I see; And now the chief who follows close behind I note,—the flower of Asia's chivalry, The heir to Mecca's throne,—whose virtuous mind From Paynim bonds of prejudice set free, I press'd him to my heart, and hail'd with pride, In friendship once, and now in faith allied. “A third still follows after, who, in show Of outward pomp, outdazzles both his peers: And where's the champion in whose veins doth flow A current of such noble blood as theirs? Yet else, methinks, that graceful form I know; It should be own'd by Baldwin of Poictiers, A generous youth, and, though of Gano's race, Heir to his fortunes, not to his disgrace.” By this, the knights advancing wave on high Their plumed casques, in gratulation fair, Mid shouts of joy; and as they press more nigh, With answering shouts resounds the vocal air: And now, in phrase of untaught courtesy, (Embraces past,) old Otho's valiant heir Begins their cause of coming to explain,— “Orlando, hail! imperial Charlemain “Sends thee this greeting;—(for myself and these Brethren in arms all reverence and love!—) At Fontarabia on the Gascon seas Our sovereign holds his court; nor thence will move, Till, as the tenor of the peace decrees, In the tremendous sight of God above, Whom Moor and Christian equally adore, Marsilius shall have seal'd the faith he swore. “But when into thy hands at Roncesvaux The solemn cession shall be made complete, The powers of France and Spain, no longer foes, In Pampeluna's royal courts shall meet; And there, instead of rude uncivil blows, Shall merriment resound through every street; For shrieks of desolate wives from husbands rent, The festive dance and knightly tournament. “On Roncesvalles' field already wait Thy coming many chiefs of worth declared; There Turpin, reverend sire, to consecrate The solemn act with holiest rites prepared, Saint Michel's lords, the Prince of Neustria's state, Montleon's Gualtier, good Duke Egibard, Avino, either Anjolin, are there, Avolio, and the gentle Berlinghier. “As marshals, we before the joyous host Are sent to meet and guide your course aright, Myself, with Sansonetto, Asia's boast, And gentle Baldwin, yet untried in fight, Who, though a little month is gone at most, Since Charles array'd, and sent him forth, a knight, Will soon, perchance, eclipse our paler fire, As he already shames our mean attire.” So spake he, jesting: but the ingenuous youth, Who, erst, Orlando's best loved page had been, And served with matchless constancy and truth, Advanced with modest blush yet manly mien— “Think not, my honour'd patron, that in sooth I would in aught but simplest garb be seen, Such as befits a knight of worth untried:— This is not Baldwin's, but a father's pride. “He bade me wear this rich embroider'd vest, Which, at your bidding, gladly I restore:” Orlando strain'd the warrior to his breast— “No, wear it still—there's none can grace it more: And, be it freely, noble friend, confest, I never felt so true a joy before, As now, that in thy welcome sight I see The surest pledge of Gano's loyalty. “For ever be ungenerous doubt,” he cried, “Offspring of idle fancy, cast away! Now, Aldabelle, resume thy wonted pride: Suspicion is a guest that shuns the day.” A deeper blush the cheek of Baldwin dyed— “Suspicion!—did my noble patron say? Now, so sit honour on my virgin sword, As spotless is the faith of Poictiers' lord.” So spake the son, unknowing yet the cause That stain'd with doubt Maganza's perjured name: And who so strange to nature's holiest laws But loves the champion of a parent's fame? Orlando mark'd his warmth with just applause. “My valiant Baldwin! on my head the blame, Whose heedless words have hurt a soul like thine: Henceforth, thy father's honour shall be mine.” Now must we leave the Paladins awhile. And ye, who kindly listen to my lay, Think they have reach'd the destined vale, where smile Soft meadows in perennial verdure gay, And, every side surrounding, pile o'er pile Rise the gigantic hills, and seem to say, Here are we fix'd by Heaven's creating hand The everlasting guardians of the land. CANTO II. Now to Montalban's raven haunted tower, Genius of old romance! direct my way; Where, erst, against the leagued imperial power The sons of Aymon held rebellious sway. Then, proud Montalban, was thy courtly bower Throng'd with the pomp of chivalrous array: But now, since peace has seal'd the fatal strife That arm'd a vassal 'gainst his sovereign's life, For many a slow revolving year, no more Thy walls have echoed any earthly sound; While, far from thee, to Asia's distant shore Thy chiefs are gone, on wild adventure bound: Now waves the rank grass from thy turrets hoar, Erewhile with Aymon's feudal banner crown'd; The sun, whose setting beams reflected shone From buckler, casque and spear, now warms the mouldering stone. Yet not untenanted,—so fame reports Among the credulous peasants of the plain,— Though Silence in thy halls and spacious courts Upholds her ancient solitary reign: But thither oft at midnight hour resorts From central caves of earth a viewless train, At Malagigi's potent spell, to wait His bidding, and lay bare the womb of fate. 'Tis said,—and, courteous hearers, if I seem On fancy's wing to take too bold a flight, The reverend Turpin vouches for my theme; And who can doubt what reverend churchmen write?— Oft from the banks of Seine's imperial stream, Borne on the rapid coursers of the night, The wise enchanter, in one little hour, Would cleave the sky to gray Montalban's tower; And there, with cabalistic lore profound, Summon the princes of the infernal coasts, Or break with potent words the hallow'd ground, Waking from death's long sleep unbodied ghosts; Then deep mysterious converse hold, till sound Of earliest cock dispersed the shadowy hosts:— So Turpin writes,—and, if you doubt the tale By me affirm'd, let Turpin's words prevail. When false Maganza to the imperial throne The peaceful answer of Marsilius bore, Many a brave peer, for faith and courage known, Doubted a fraud in every smile he wore; But chiefly Malagigi, whether prone By cautious nature to suspect, or more Than others knew by art superior taught, Freely proclaim'd the peace with treason fraught. And then, since Charles, unheeding all he told, And fondly trusting a false favorite's tale, His mandate sent to Clermont's lord, to hold That solemn meeting in the appointed vale, With stern despight that would not be controll'd, The enchanter sought, beneath the moonlight pale, Montalban's towers, and there deep ponder'd o'er, Night following night, his strange mysterious lore. Down in the infernal cavern's deepest place His mansion holds a spirit wise and strong And terrible; of his abandon'd race Moves none more black those dismal courts among; Yet over him, by Heaven's eternal grace, The more to humble that rebellious throng, Have magic charms permitted power to quell His savage force with adamantine spell. Him Malagigi summon'd: by his voice Compell'd the dæmon rose; but fiercer far Than subject spirit suits; as if the choice He had to serve, or wage vindictive war. He smiled, as devils smile when they rejoice,— Such smile as murderers in their vengeance wear. That smile the enchanter mark'd, and felt the hour Draw nigh when he must render back his power. Shuddering he mark'd, but soon collected spoke: “Not yet, oh Astaroth! not yet the day That frees immortals from my earthly yoke: Still art thou bound, and still thou must obey. Hear then my last command! Henceforth be broke The mighty spell and melt in air away, So now my potent bidding thou fulfil: Hear, then, submissive! hear, and do my will! “First teach me, for thou canst, since Charles hath gone, Reckless of danger, to the coast of Spain, And he, the great defender of his throne, Abides the Moor on Roncesvalles' plain, What doom is in the rolls of fate foreshown? What is the doom of France and Charlemain? Say, doth the dæmon of destruction lower, With treason leagued, o'er all the Christian power?” “Master!—so still thou art!”—the fiend replied, (For that determined voice recall'd the day When magic bound for his rebellious pride Seven years within the rifted rock he lay,) “Things are there in the womb of fate denied To spiritual ken as sense of mortal clay: The past and present are our own; but eye Of creature never pierced futurity. “Darkly indeed and doubtfully we trace Shadows that flit behind the eternal veil. Sometimes we view them imaged in the face Of outer heaven in colours dim and pale, But nothing certain. Had Almighty Grace Thrown such a weight of knowledge in our scale, How should the boaster, Man, elude our powers? No,—God hath clipp'd our wings, or the wide world were ours. “Think'st thou, if Lucifer himself, the first, As once in heaven, so now in lowest hell, Could pierce that sacred veil, that he had durst Claim power supreme, and, claiming it, rebel?— Or we those easier chains of wrath had burst To make our second fall more damnable? No, no; all knowledge is to angels known,— All but the future: that is God's alone. “Yet what I can my master may command. Know then that all the circling air is dense With spirits, each his astrolabe in hand, Searching the hidden ways of Providence. For from his throne in Scorpio o'er the land Now gloomy Mars sheds baleful influence, Portending chances terrible and strange, Treason and blood to man, to empires change. “Yes,—in that heavenly sign I see portray'd The massacre of nations, and the fall Of mighty states, and man by man betray'd, And many a prince's bloody funeral. Hast thou not mark'd yon comet, that array'd In sanguine lustre rules this nightly ball? All this and worse that sanguine beam foreshows; A long interminable train of woes. “Thus far into the future can I see, And only thus; for, what conclusion thence The mind may draw, it open lies to thee As much as to the keenest spiritual sense. But, for the things that were and those that be, Somewhat to me my searching sight presents, To thee unknown, that may, if rightly told, More of hereafter to thy mind unfold. “Know then, when Poictiers' traitorous lord was sent, With courteous phrase the Moorish chief to greet, Veiling in honest show his base intent, As if by Charles deliver'd, at his feet He dared pronounce so rude a compliment, So full of threats for sovereign's ear unmeet, That proud Marsilius, swelling with disdain, Hurl'd back defiance stern to Charlemain. “And when thus apt for vengeance, hot for blood, The prince he found, this wily traitor knew By weaving phrases of more courtly mood, Unto his damned purpose to subdue And mould that tiger soul. It were not good, He said, such insolent mockery to pursue With open vengeance, which might miss its blow: No,—make the example terrible though slow. “From hour to hour his favour stronger grows With Saragossa's monarch, till it seems Marsilius through his knowledge all things knows, Thinks with his thoughts and with his reason deems: One day it chanced, beneath the verdant rows Of poplar fringing rapid Ebro's streams, Tired with the chase, that from the noontide heat They sought together a secure retreat; “And there, to end my tale, between them plann'd A work so full of monstrous villany, That, heard in hell, the whole infernal band Raised one loud shout, reechoing to the sky. The mine is now prepared, the work in hand; Nor can I in the signs of Heaven descry, If godlike virtue may not guard the event, Aught to divert its full accomplishment. “It matters not, their bloody league complete, As from the bank arose that son of hell, That the wild carob shook, and at his feet The accursed fruit, sign of Heaven's anger, fell; Though, since Iscariot's death, the judgment seat Had never witness'd deed so damnable. A moment's space the traitor stood aghast, The next, laugh'd at his fears and onward pass'd. “‘How, if Orlando fears?’ ‘He shall not fear,’ The traitor answer'd:—‘to confirm him ours, Give me the surcoat thou art used to bear In purple wrought and stiff with golden flowers: That vest my son, my only son, shall wear, A safe protection when the battle lowers, And thus begirt, as with Jove's ægis, be Himself the guide of Clermont's chivalry,. “‘Their ignorant guide to havoc and despair: Do thou but pledge thy solemn faith to mine, To bid thy soldiers watch with special care, And when they mark, amidst the Christian line, The embroider'd vest their sovereign used to wear Upon a young and gallant warrior shine, That warrior see ye spare, and spare alone!— That warrior is the son of Ganellon.’” The dæmon paused; and thus the enchanter said: “Too well, oh Astaroth! too well I see A sight to fill the stoutest heart with dread, The fearful hour of Gallia's chivalry. Already are the mountains wide o'erspread, Wave following wave, by one devouring sea, While in the vale our Paladins await, Thoughtless of ill, the o'erwhelming rush of fate. “But say, is there no hope of safety yet? No buckler yet the impending blow to stay?” “None—Roncesvalles is the fowler's net, Already cast around the unconscious prey. They know it not; but ere the sun hath set That dawns upon the third portentous day, For every lance in that devoted band, Unnumber'd Paynim swords will sweep across the land.” Silent and sad awhile the enchanter sate; Then cried, “Oh yet—Orlando's powerful sword May yet carve out for France a nobler fate.” “Yes, so it please high heaven's imperial Lord That for the weal of that neglectful state The days of Amalek shall be restored.” The irreverent taunt the enchanter heeded not, But inly musing—“Whatsoe'er their lot, “Would,” he exclaim'd, “they had Rinaldo there! That wondrous arm might turn the opposing scale.” Then thus to Astaroth,—“Say, dæmon, where Lingers my cousin in this mortal vale?” Eastward he turn'd those eyes that through mid air Ten thousand leagues can swift as lightning sail— “I see him now beneath the sultry skies Where Pharaoh's everlasting temples rise.” Then Malagigi gave his last command, That in three days the dæmon should convey Montalban's knight from Egypt's burning sand To Roncesvalles, through the aërial way. “Henceforth be free from spell of mortal band, As thou shalt this my last behest obey!” Grimly the dæmon smiled his last farewell— “Thou art obey'd,” he cried; then plunged to hell. Montalban's towers and silent streams and glades Sleep in the quiet moonshine, when from far Borne through mid heaven attend the courser shades Self-harness'd to their visionary car. “To Charlemain, ere yet the moonbeam fades, Lost in the brightness of Aurora's star, Bear me, my steeds, in silence through the sky: Yet may we change Orlando's destiny!” He who from dull repose short hours can steal, Alone to wander mid the calm serene Of a fair summer's midnight, and can feel His soul accordant to that solemn scene, May think how joyful, swift as thought, to wheel From fleecy cloud to cloud, while all between Is one pure flood of light, and dim and slow Rolls the wide world of vapour far below. And now o'er Roncesvalles' fatal plain Hovering, the wise enchanter bids descend His coursers, and awhile their speed restrain: Now far o'er hill and vale his eyes extend, Beyond ungifted vision's furthest strain; And, miles and miles around, space without end, Where'er the moonbeams fell, their sparkling light Glanced back from groves of steel, and scared the peaceful night. Yet not a breath disturbs the air; nor sound Of clashing arms, nor shout of revelry, Nor squadrons trampling o'er the hollow ground Give signal of the Moorish chivalry. Twice more the sun must walk his daily round, And bathe his forehead in the Gascon sea, Ere yet the tallest Pagan spear shall show Its glittering point to the devoted foe. Who wakes in Roncesvalles? Is there one That slumbers not, secure from thought of ill? All slumber,—all save Oliver alone— All but unhappy Oliver, whom still That icy grasp of death, that stifled groan, Those words of more than mortal warning thrill With memory's pangs, and force him wide to stray, A sad, self-brooding man, till dawn of day. Him when the enchanter saw, as on the brow Of a projecting precipice he stood, Fixing his eyes on empty space below, But inly rapt in his own gloomy mood; Through a disguise so strange he could not know; And who had known, in that wild solitude, With eyes so fixt and looks so wan and drear, The flower of knighthood, gallant Olivier? Like one unknown upon his path he came, And thus in few and hasty words addrest: “Go, wake yon eagle! for the aspiring flame Already mounts, and fires his royal nest: Treason hath writ in blood Orlando's name, And Hell is busy with the coming feast. Go, wake yon eagle! for the toils are spread, And the proud fowler marks him for the dead.” Thus said, he sprang into his car, and high Soar'd in an instant out of mortal sight, Steering his voyage through the dusky sky To reach the imperial camp ere morning light. Roused from his trance, long time with eager eye The Paladin in vain pursues his flight, Straining the almost bursting orbs, till day Stole unperceived the shadowy hours away. “Arm, arm! Orlando, arm! Above, around, On every side, his toils hath Treason traced.” Scared from his slumbers at the startling sound, Soon has the valiant knight his armour braced, And climb'd with toilsome speed the highest ground; And thither Anselm, Sansonetto, haste; Gualtier and youthful Baldwin too are there, Astolpho, and the gentle Berlinghier. Above, below, around, on every side, They cast their eager and inquiring eyes; But void and waste extend the mountains wide, And void and waste the silent valley lies, As at the hour when the Creator cried, “Be spread, ye valleys! and, ye mountains, rise!”— “Oh Oliver! what vision, wild and vain, My friend, my brother! hath disturb'd thy brain?” Another day, another night are o'er, And Oliver his watch tower mounts again; The hills are void and silent as before, And void and silent as before, the plain. He warns Orlando of his fate once more, And once again he finds his warning vain; Then solitary and dejected strays Till the third day star o'er the mountain plays. Above, below, around, on every side, He turns his eyes; and sees reflected shine The beaming light from war's advancing tide; Sees o'er the hills the interminable line Of steel-clad squadrons wind in martial pride, Seeming in one bright girdle to confine All that devoted vale, the closing stage, To many a knight, of earth's loved pilgrimage. Too late Orlando owns the truth,—too late For wise retreat, or provident defence: Yet not a signal of his coming fate But swells his bosom with a nobler sense; And not a partner of his perilous state But feels a martyr's holy confidence, While, warm and strengthening like celestial food, Flows from his lips the stream of Christian fortitude. “Could I have thought that in the human heart Such hellish treason might a lodging find, I would have play'd a soldier's better part, Not thus untimely to my fate resign'd, But force opposed to force and art to art. Hither I came, to peace and love inclined, And thought the love that in my bosom burn'd For all mankind, with equal love return'd. “Yet the deceiver shall himself deceive, On his own head the dreadful thunders call; While ye, who in eternal truth believe, Sure of approving heaven, will nobly fall: Soon shall ye all rejoice, though now ye grieve, And change for food divine your bitter gall; Though now your bread be mix'd with tears and sighs, Your souls this night shall feast in Paradise. “So to his Greeks the generous Spartan said, Whose promises were far less sure than mine: Them only hope exalted when they bled; Your hope is faith, your promises divine. See on the grate the martyr'd Laurence spread; Even in the flames his eyes with transport shine, And show how easy and how sweet to die, When the freed soul is rapt and fixt on high. “And now, while little life is yet your own, All fearless mingle in the bloody fray! Now, Paladins, be all your prowess shown; So shall your bodies only die this day. Now let the fathers by their sons be known, And cast delusive fruitless hope away! Fight not for life! Caught in this fatal snare, Our hope is death; our confidence, despair. “And yet it grieves me, noble Charles, for thee,— That, after such high fame, thy royal head Is doom'd so sad, so dark a change to see, Thine honours blasted and thy glory fled! But ah! no human state from change is free, Whole empires hang upon the slenderest thread; And often Fate, at Heaven's appointed hour, Exalts the meek, and blasts the proud man's power. “Thee too!—this faithful bosom bleeds for thee, My cousin, my Rinaldo! Once again Might I that much loved form in battle see, Proud in the field, and dreadful o'er the slain!— Even while I speak, strange visions welcome me, Hope's cheering phantoms crowd upon my brain. I feel,—I know,—that with this mortal eye I yet shall view Rinaldo ere I die. “I fear not death; but hope my worth to show, And nobly on the bloody field to lie; To deal the wrath of Heaven and tenfold woe On baneful fraud and curst impiety: Death is not to be fear'd, but when we know The soul shall also with the body die; The loss of life is gain, if spirits flee From this cold clay to immortality. “Think how the self-devoted Decii died, And other noble patriot souls of yore, Who fell, to satisfy a glorious pride, And leave their memories when they were no more. Death is to you the pilot who will guide Your parted spirits to a happier shore: O how much greater than all earthly love Is that which hopes and pants for things above! “And now, my friends and brethren, O receive The last fond blessing that your chief can give! Your parting souls shall holy Turpin shrieve, Assured in heaven eternally to live. Even now, in faith's bright mirror, I perceive The undoubted sign of your prerogative; The gates of Heaven are open'd wide around, And radiant angels guard the fatal ground.” Thus said, he once more vaulted on his steed, And loud exclaim'd, “Now for our treacherous foes!” But, when he saw his comrades doom'd to bleed, Some tender tears of human pity rose.— “Ah vale accurst!” he cried, “ah vale decreed For orphans' sufferings and the widow's woes! The latest ages shall thy name deplore, And mark with blood, till time itself is o'er.” On every front the holy Turpin traced A sacred cross, and benediction gave, And pardon'd them through him in whom are placed Our hope and trust, who died mankind to save. Then all the valiant band in tears embraced, And drew their swords, and stood, resolved and brave: Almonte's banner waved their lines before, The banner won in Aspramount of yore. CANTO III. Whoe'er had heard the brazen trumpet's blast In Roncesvalles on that fatal morn, Might look to see the world's vain pageant past, The eternal veil of heaven asunder torn, And its appointed angel come at last To bid the grave yield up her dead new-born: So terrible was that portentous sound Borne by the mountain echos wide around— Wide, wide around the mountain echos bore That soul-dissolving clangor; cold dismay A moment all the Pagan host came o'er, And check'd the advancing battle's proud array; A moment only,—and with answering roar, Loud as the ocean surges, when the spray Is tempest-driven against impending skies, Through all the lengthening line the shouts of slaughter rise. Strange shouts, and yells, and dissonant turbulence Of nations, brought from earth's remotest bound, Mix'd with the din of martial instruments, The clash of arms, the neigh of steeds, the sound (Like shock of wildly jarring elements) Of squadrons trampling o'er the hollow ground: The Christians felt the gathering storm draw near, But not a hero's cheek was blanch'd with fear. Up the steep heights the Christian warriors strain, Firm and unbroken o'er the rugged ground, Nor heed the Moorish darts, that fall like rain On their broad shields and heads with iron bound: Foremost to climb, and first the ascent to gain, (As England's sons in war are ever found,) The English knight his banner plants on high: “Forward! Behold the Pagan dastards fly!” Awhile on every side, as panic-driven, The outnumbering hosts recoil; for at a blow Astolpho's lance had shield and hauberk riven, And stretch'd their first and stoutest champion low: But soon, as clouds, by the rude blasts of heaven Dispell'd, unite and burst in floods below, Back to the charge the astonish'd squadrons pour With hotter fury, and the fight restore. Here on the right unhappy Olivier, Desperate of life, deals shame and slaughter round; Gualtier and gentle Berlinghier are here, And keep unmoved the hard-won vantage ground: But in the front of danger, death, and fear, The English lance is ever foremost found, And ever there the English crest elate Moves, the terrific harbinger of fate. Nor less upon the left, in arms allied, Each gallant Anjolin his prowess tries, And Baldwin, with a youthful soldier's pride, And eye firm fixt on Fame's immortal prize, Courts Danger, like a new and blushing bride, And wonders why his eager suit she flies; Ah brave unhappy boy! his guileless breast Knew not the charm of Poictiers' treacherous vest! But who shall speak the terrors of that hour, When, as o'er Libya's hot and thirsty land Moves, bursts, and falls, the self-erected tower, And whelms whole armies in a waste of sand, So dark and dreadful, o'er the Moorish power, Hung great Orlando's desolating hand, And, with unerring aim, where'er it fell, Laid bare some new and fearful path to hell! “From morn till noon, from noon till dewy night,” With unabated rage the contest glow'd; And not a Christian in that bloody fight Gave up to Heaven the sacrifice he owed, But first, in glorious witness of the right, From Pagan breasts a plenteous current flow'd, And ghastly heaps on heaps of slaughter'd foes A monument of Heaven's stern justice rose. The God of battles, that tremendous day, Look'd from his throne of vengeance o'er the field, And scatter'd wild confusion and dismay From the red terrors of his blazing shield: 'Tis said,—(the crowd believes what zealots say,) The archangel's self, to human eyes reveal'd, In radiant armour, on a snow white horse, Thrice rallied to the charge the Christian force. And still let those believe who cannot feel What sovereign force almighty virtue hath: More hard than adamant, more strong than steel, Scorning the weak assaults of human wrath, Virtue thro' life and death, thro' woe and weal, Keeps irresistible her onward path, Nor can be turn'd by terror or surprise, Till Heaven's own towers before her sight arise. Brave flower of widow'd England! in thy sight Already do those towers unveil'd appear, Thou best and earliest victim of the fight, Cut glorious off in manhood's proud career! Already beams the fresh created light On Anjolin and gentle Berlinghier, Light from a purer heaven, a brighter sun, Than sparkles on their own beloved Garonne. Amidst the Paynim host a stranger knight It chanced that day his maiden faulchion drew, The son of that old mountain Ismaelite Whom in a better hour Orlando knew,— Whom high Montalban's lord in single fight (Sent by the Persian princess) first o'erthrew, Then bound in friendship's holiest knot, till He Who breaks all earthly bondage set him free. 'Twere long to tell what changeful stars had led That youthful wanderer to the coast of Spain, What phrensy urged, his heart's best blood to shed In treason's cause on Roncesvalles' plain: E'en now the sword of Clermont, on his head Descending swift, had stretch'd him with the slain, Had he not mark'd its threatening course, and low Cowering to earth, escaped the deadly blow;— Yet so escaped not, but that flaming brand, Which never thirsted yet in vain for blood, In glittering fragments scatter'd o'er the sand His gilded casque, and drank the vital flood. Tottering he sank; the conqueror's ruthless hand, Twined in his locks, its murderous aim renew'd— When “Spare, O spare,” with feeble voice he cried, “A miserable youth by birth allied!” When good Orlando heard that voice in prayer, Before his eyes the father's image stood; By pity moved, he loosed his twisted hair, Embraced the youth, and with his tears bedew'd: “Thy form, thy face,” he cried, “the truth declare; Mine ancient friend I here behold renew'd: Yet 'twas ill done, young soldier, to oppose Thy father's friends, and arm to serve his foes!” “O chief revered! O master!” he replied, “To thee my sword, myself, my faith I yield, So I may hope to perish at thy side, Devoted warrior, on this bloody field: For fall thou must! Though war's impetuous tide This day roll harmless round thy heaven-girt shield, Though triumph crown the wonders of thy hand, Yet fall thou must, with all thy generous band! “Think'st thou, this countless host disperst and fled, Treason hath laid her cunning toils in vain? No—Ere to-morrow's sun shall rear his head, This countless host, thrice number'd crowds the plain; A brave and stately victim thou art led To feed the altars of insatiate Spain, And they who drive thee to the stake are those Whom thy free bosom for its inmates chose!” As he who, wandering through some vernal wood, Or tangled copse, no latent danger fears, But keeps unmoved his calm or cheerful mood— If 'chance some ambush'd adder's hiss he hears, Back to his heart recoils the healthful blood, And death's pale livery on his cheek appears;— So, like the serpent's hiss, that hateful sound To Clermont's inmost soul its freezing passage found. “What! treason in my camp! among my friends— My noble generous friends!” he shuddering cried. “Yes! look where now his onward course he bends, That friend, to Poictiers' bloody race allied! Hast thou not mark'd his gorgeous vest, where blends The sun-bright gold with empire's purple pride? That to the traitor sire Marsilius gave, Alone, of all thy host, the traitor son to save!” O Saragossa! though with blood imbrued, How fair, when aftertimes thy story tell, Will show thy guilt by black ingratitude! It is the sin by which the devil fell From the bright mansions of beatitude To unremitting pain, unfathom'd hell; It is the sin that loudest cries to heaven; It is the sin that never was forgiven. Now had Orlando left that old man's son, And, fired with rage, sought Baldwin o'er the course; Who call'd for death, which seem'd his path to shun, And spend on less adventurous heads its force. When he beheld swift Brigliadoro run Hot o'er the field, (Orlando's well-known horse,) He rush'd to meet his friend beloved, and cried, “What woes, unfortunate!—this head betide! “I seek to-day among the brave to die, And many a warrior by my lance lies slain; But none against this arm their force will try: I call, I threaten, to the fight in vain!” “False boy!” return'd the chief, “no more they'll fly, Lay but that gaudy garment on the plain, Which to thy traitor sire Marsilius gave, For which that traitor sold his son a slave!” “If on this day,” the unhappy youth replied, “Thee and thy friends my father has betray'd, And I am curst to live, this hand shall guide Keen to his heart the parricidal blade! But I, Orlando!”—thus in tears he cried, “Was never, never, for a traitor made, Unless I've earn'd the name in following thee With true, with perfect love, o'er land and sea. “Now to the conflict I return once more; The traitor's name I shall not carry long.” That fraudful, fatal vest away he tore, And said, “My love to thee was firm and strong! This heart no guile, this breast no treason bore; Indeed, Orlando, thou hast done me wrong!”— Then burst away—The hero mark'd his air With altering heart, that droop'd at his despair. Already to the main's remotest bound Rolls in his rapid car the glorious sun, And evening's grateful shadows gather round On either host, with murderous toil fordone: How changed, since on the steel-embattled ground From the bright east his early splendours shone, When glittering arms pour'd back a brighter flood! Now half their fires are quench'd in dust and blood. Still victory suspends in middle air Her doubtful scale; and for a moment's breath, As if by sudden concert, both forbear (Christian and Moor) the fearful work of death. In that dread pause the generous Olivier Bends, sadly pensive, o'er the ensanguined heath, Where cold and stiff the Briton's corse is found; And with a soldier's tears embalms the sacred wound. O blest in saint-like slumber! O redeem'd From all the miseries of this vale below! Was it for thee the warrior's sorrows stream'd? Can human tears for happy angels flow? Ah! how much rather, if but rightly deem'd, Those tears should fall for human vice and woe, The retchlessness of life, the fear to die, Hopeless desire, heart-sinking infamy! But short the pause to sorrowing friendship lent— Rise, warriors, would ye call your lives your own! Lo! from the distant hills in swift descent, Like some swoln mountain torrent, thunder down Squadrons unthinn'd by war, by toil unspent, Led to the charge by Persian Falseron: Already with the foremost bands in fight They mix; already bleeds the foremost Christian knight. Orlando, roused by war's reechoing cries, Hastes to the charge; back fall the squadrons round: And see where hapless Baldwin gasping lies, Pierced to the heart by no dishonest wound! “I am no traitor now!” he faintly cries, Then sinks a stiffen'd corse upon the ground— With bleeding soul Orlando saw him die. “Thy fate is seal'd; the unhappy cause am I!” There is a time for woe,—a peaceful hour, When the sore-wounded heart may seek relief For ills, past cure of every earthly power, In the dissolving luxury of grief: But when the blast of war uproots the bower, And strews the vale with many a wither'd leaf, Joy to the mourner!—He no longer hears In that rude storm his sighs, nor feels his starting tears. This truth confess'd Anglanté's Paladine, When vengeance every softer thought subdued That else, for Baldwin lost, perchance might twine About his heart, and chill the vital flood: But when that eastern satrap mark'd the sign Of Fate, fore-doom'd in Clermont's mantling blood, As from the bolt of heaven, with headlong speed Aghast he fled, and urged his purple-harness'd steed. O how unlike the chief, whose boasts were heard From far Euphrates to the Ebro wave, That he would tear Anglanté's honour'd beard, And set his foot upon the Christian slave, And wreak such vengeance as the world ne'er heard For bold Ferrau, whom to a bloody grave The knight had sent, what time the powers of Spain First homage paid to conquering Charlemain! “Turn, traitor!” (the rude gales such sounds convey'd To his uwilling ears)—“For Baldwin slain, Turn, traitor! Be that Judas kiss repaid, Which erst was pledged upon the banks of Seine!”— Stung by the taunt, the flying soldan staid His full career; while impotent Disdain And smarting Pride contended with his fear, And half resolved him to abide the tempest hurrying near. But half resolved he staid, and still for flight Uncertain, or for deed of manly daring, Till, terrible as thunder, swift as light, The Christian lance drove on, through buckler tearing, Hauberk, and plated mail;—the shades of night Cloud round his swimming eyeballs, and, down bearing Horseman and horse to earth with thundering force, Fate irresistible pursues its iron course. Low sweeps the dust the boaster's humbled head, And loud and wide his clanging arms resound: But (so in ancient chronicles 'tis read) Were never more beheld above the ground The cold and bloody reliques of the dead: There where he fell was his rent buckler found, His empty cuirass, greaves, and morrion there, But where the naked corse could none declare. The God of justice (in that elder time Men fondly deem'd) would sometimes from the course, By which he guides the wheels of Fate sublime, Deviate awhile, and with miraculous force Stamp on the forehead of unblushing Crime, Dead to the probing search of kind Remorse, Some direful impress of his wrath, to stand The warning wonder of a guilty land. Not now by prophet's tongue, or angel's flight, Or ghost, or spell, God lets his power be known: Yet not the less display'd to mortal sight (Would thankless man his father's empire own) The blazing beacon stands of wrong and right: Not he who fills the world's ill gotten throne,— That self-appointed arbiter of fate,— Sits so secure in his tremendous state, But in the solemn hour of secret thought, In that dark hour, when Pride and Grandeur sleep, When poison drugs the soul's unhallow'd draught, Through Sin's voluptuous bowers when scorpions creep, Then Conscience comes, with nameless terrors fraught, And with her flaming signet, broad and deep, Brands the pale tyrant's brow, and fires his brain With quenchless torments of delirious pain. For ever shall that fiery torment last, For ever shall that awful impress stand, Plain as the old miraculous legend traced Upon the wall by Heaven's conspicuous hand, Defaceless as the holy symbol cast (So sages erst believed) by just command On Israel's wretched exile, doom'd to stray A wanderer over earth until the judgement day. Forgive, kind hearers, my wide wandering strain, Uncheck'd by rules of sterner minstrelsy, If, from the baseless fabric of the brain, I sometimes turn to sad reality. The genius of romance with loosen'd rein Still gives his Hippogryff to wander free, Now o'er the aërial heights that gave him birth, Now through the calm and lowly vales of earth. So he, “of dames and knights, of arms and love, Of courtesies and high attempts,” who sung, Oft with the web of fancy interwove Alphonso's praises, or with bolder tongue Call'd down the vengeful lightning from above On Cæsar's head, whom mad Ambition stung O'er blind Ausonia's weeping fields to pour His harpy legions from Iberia's shore. Yet rest, my wandering steed, ere long to soar Mid higher regions of excursive song, The secrets of the eternal veil explore, And realms that to the shadowy hosts belong! The cries of slaughter and the battle's roar Die on my listening ear, while, borne along Through midway air, with all too sudden speed I rise;—then rest awhile my wandering steed! CANTO IV. Imagination, whose unbounded sight Can at one glance embrace all sea and land, Now swift pursues the dæmon's destined flight, Prompt to obey his master's last command, From high Montalban to those realms of night Where Pharaoh's old sepulchral temples stand, Where Guiscard and his greater brother bore Duke Aymon's banner on that Pagan shore. Turbid and deep the mighty river flow'd, Curtain'd in shades of evening; by whose side Montalban's lords pursued their mazy road, Listening the murmurs of that sullen tide: When from the tomb, Sesostris' last abode, Silent a darkling form was seen to glide, The giant shadow of a knight and horse, That onward seem'd to bear its threatening course. “Be mine the adventure!” cried the younger peer, And spurr'd, that vision new and strange to meet: The gallant courser stopp'd in mid career, And toss'd his mane, and, plunging, from his seat Strove to shake off the rider; while the spear Of that unearthly warrior, following fleet The impulse lent, without a blow or wound, Like some rude tempest hurl'd him to the ground. Uncheck'd, as through the yielding air he pass'd, That wondrous spectre,—and o'er all things near Breathed a damp chillness which the soul o'ercast Of brave Rinaldo, long unused to fear: It seem'd as hell had sent some poisonous blast, Embodied in that image dark and drear, To freeze the courage of the noblest knight That e'er curb'd gallant steed or harness'd armour bright. All powerless stood the Paladin, the while A laugh insulting from the vision broke, Laugh, that reechoed from the banks of Nile Even to his lunar source,—then fiercely spoke: “My name is Astaroth: from that famed pile That erst obey'd Duke Aymon's lordly yoke, Hither I steer my flight to make thee know His will, whose art compels the powers below. “Thus then thy wizard kinsman bids me say: In Roncesvalles, at this fatal hour, All marshall'd sits in terrible array, By great Marsilius led, the Moorish power; Unconscious yet the heaven-devoted prey Waits while Destruction's dæmons round him lower, The chief who wields Anglanté's powerful lance; And with him every prince and paladin of France.” He ceased: but when Montalban's loyal peer That mortal danger of his friends had known, Each baser taint of wonder, doubt, and fear, Like shadows fled before high reason's throne; While every impulse form'd and seated there Gave place, and strong affection ruled alone: It seem'd a thousand years in every day That kept him from his valiant friends away. “And thou, mysterious agent! whether sprung From shades below, or light above, O say,— Shall I not mingle in the battle's throng My blood with theirs upon that fatal day?” The fiend replied not; but, as if among Attendant crowds,—“Speed, messenger, away! And bring that Æthiopian plant, whose flower To mock the feeble sight of man hath power!” Thus as he spoke, he look'd towards empty space, And sound, as if rustling wings, replied: Seized with strange awe, Montalban's knightly grace Look'd wild and wide around, but nothing spied. “Thy wonder cease, weak child of Adam's race!” Thus with a scornful smile the dæmon cried, “Know that ten thousand spirits around me stray To do my bidding, be it night or day. “As here on earth, so boast the realms below, Thrones and dominions, princedoms, virtues, powers; And, as mankind their several stations know, And keep their destined course, so we do ours. 'Tis mine to bear thee to that field of woe Where Christian blood distills in purple showers, A kindred stream,—and, if the will divine Have so ordain'd, haply to mix with thine! “Nor fear a dæmon's faith, nor doubt to trust Thy frail existence to the power of fate; What though ye be, weak children of the dust, Sport of our malice, our revenge, and hate, E'en were I not compell'd, as now I must, To yield obedience, for a certain date, To mortal spells and man's accurst control, This is a fiend-like part and suits my soul. “I know the deeds of death thine arm will do In Roncesvalles; therefore freely bear, With such glad scenes of slaughter in my view, Thee and thy Christian brother through the air: What sanguine streams shall rush that valley through! How shall we feast on anguish and despair! It is the festival of Hell to see Man equal to the damn'd in misery.” By this return'd the attendant sprite and stood Confest to view, bearing that charmed plant From where it sprung by Niger's eastward flood, On Samen's mount, the satyrs' fabled haunt, Or in Zendero's old inaugural wood, Or where the hunted pards of Sennaar pant. From its prest leaves a potent dew is shed, Veiling in sightless mist the anointed head. The dæmon's form dispersing seem'd to glide Into thin smoke, and curl'd along the ground To where Boyardo stood with nostrils wide Snuffing the balmy gales that breathed around: Now by the subtle spirit possest, supplied With sense unknown, with powers before unfound, His eyes flash fire and, tossing wild and high His eager neck, he burns to mount into the sky. Nor less the steed that good Guiscardo bore Confess'd some kindred power; each brother knight, With that strange robe of darkness cover'd o'er, Leaps on his ready courser swift as light; And in an instant's space as high they soar As soars the eagle in his loftiest flight. The virtues of the charmed herb, or Heaven Itself, had calm'd their souls and made their courage even. 'Twas now the hour when fond Desire renews To those who wander o'er the pathless main, Raising unbidden tears, the last adieus Of tender friends whom Fancy shapes again; When the late parted pilgrim who pursues His lonely walk o'er some unbounded plain, If sound of distant bells fall on his ear, Seems the sad knell of his departed joys to hear. Lights, numberless as by some fountain's side The silly swain reposing (at the hour When beams the day star with diminish'd pride, When the sunn'd bee deserts each rifled flower, And yields to humming gnats the populous void,) Beholds in grassy lawn, or leafy bower, Or orchard plot, of glow-worms emerald bright, Flamed in the front of that ambrosial night. Vain fears, the impious progeny of crime, Hold no alliance with a scene so fair; Remembrance claims the consecrated time, And Love refined from every selfish care. Thus, as they wheel their rapid course sublime Through the mid realms of circumambient air, In spirit they have reach'd the fatal place, And strain their brethren in a last embrace. Fain would I tell, as Arno's bard hath told, What hill and valley, sea and running flood, What peopled cities, and what forests old, Rich champain, idle desert, waving wood, Lay underneath like some vast map unroll'd, As swift their airy voyage they pursued, Scanning, 'twixt sun and sun, the regions wide From Meroe's lake to Gades' western tide;— Fain would repeat, in this my careless rhyme, The converse held by proud Montalban's knight With the fall'n angel,—converse, strange, sublime, Of things beyond the ken of feeble sight: For spirits, still unharm'd by age or time, Retain the spark divine of earliest light, (Angelic nature!) nor, though lost, forget Their happier state, but hope and tremble yet. Hope lives through fear: who saith that hope is vain? Worm of the earth! canst thou presume to trace The eternal limits of God's holy reign, Infinite justice and unfailing grace? Will Heaven destroy its own fair work again? Or, after some dark, doubtful, lingering space, All with one voice eternal truth adore, And humbly sue for peace and gain what they implore? Beyond the pillars of this world of old, Far o'er yon western flood's unmeasured plain, Of other worlds the spirit darkly told, For ages lost, for ages to remain Unvisited by light divine, and cold As Zembla's rocks which endless frosts enchain: Yet hath the sun of Grace, to them unknown, E'en for those cheerless realms and untaught nations shone. Such the high themes that held in wonder bound The sons of Aymon, while their mystic guide Still onward bore them through the vast profound. As to some wretch who, after wanderings wide, Returns to view his once loved native ground, Forgotten dreams of youth's gay morning tide Crowd on each gale, and with a transient light Delusive gild the lonely gloom of night; E'en so, as in the dæmon's upward flight He almost reach'd the heaven from whence he fell, The purer airs of that celestial height Might for a space the noxious fumes of hell Haply disperse, and new-created light Beam on the darkness of the soul's deep cell, Renewing traces of the angelic frame, Long forfeited by sin to death and shame. But when (descending o'er that fatal plain At latest eve) before them seem'd to rise From the low vale the blood of thousands slain Staining with crimson blush the conscious skies; When, in wild dissonance, the groans of pain Came mingled with the battle's fiercer cries; Then every softer shade at once was flown, And all the dæmon reassumed his throne. The barbarous legends of an elder age, Nursed in the darkness of some cloister'd cell, Now scorn'd or pitied by the gay or sage, The chasten'd muse must shun;—else would she tell How, on the top of yon lone hermitage Descending swift, the winged sons of hell Fix'd their damn'd seat, to arrest the upward flight Of spirits battle-freed, and thrust them back to night. Aided by grace divine and heavenly love, The Christian souls elastic spurn'd their hold, Sprang fearless to their glorious seats above, And sit amid the angelic choir enroll'd: But Mahound's impure votaries vainly strove, Fluttering and struggling, till, in many a fold Of serpent strength comprest, forworn and spent, Down, down they sink, a steep, dark, bottomless descent. Leave we these baseless phantoms and pursue Montalban's banner through the ranks of war;— But distant yet;—for, where the standard flew O'er Saragossa's proud pavilion, far From the throng'd battle field, confest to view Alight the brother chiefs, like that twin star In arms refulgent, whose mild radiance guides The prosperous vessel o'er obedient tides. “Do armed angels mingle in the fight?”— Thus bursts from rank to rank the general cry; And panic Terror, and disgraceful Flight, And crimson Slaughter's horrid form were nigh: E'en He, whose iron heart each sound and sight Of woe and dread did till that hour defy, In that appalling vision seem'd to own A higher power and tremble on his throne. Perhaps some prescience of approaching fate, Obscurely shadow'd, flash'd across his brain, When Aymon's banner in victorious state Shall wave o'er Saragossa's loftiest fane, And life prolong'd to misery's utmost date In dreadful vengeance for Orlando slain, At length expire, not glorious in the fight, But midst the groans of scorn and fierce despight. But not Marsilius, nor the tented field Those brother warriors sought: where Clermont's lance Still ruled the opposing war, and Clermont's shield Protected still the Paladins of France, Thither while crowds on crowds retiring yield, Like vapours scatter'd by the sun's advance, They flew on coursers swifter than the wind, And left their panic-striken foes behind. Orlando, as the furious chief drew near, Like lightning borne across the battle field, Or friend or foe uncertain, held his spear, Prepared to meet the thundering shock, or yield: But when through clouds of dust he saw appear Montalban's lion on the blazing shield,— Ye, who the thrilling transport e'er have known To meet some long-lost friend when every hope was flown, Judge ye if rapture's full impetuous tide Swell'd his bold heart, and triumph'd in his face; If ardent love the strength of wings supplied, As swift he rush'd to meet his friend's embrace— No: bloodless was his cheek; his bosom's pride Was cold; his limbs dropp'd nerveless; and the space That parts the living from the realm of night Was closing fast before his dizzy sight. And Oliver, who ever foremost stood Where Clermont's banner stemm'd the battle's rage, Still flow'd the current of his gentler blood? Still kept his pulse its wonted vassalage? Oh! loosen'd oft by Joy's too sudden flood, Asunder bursts the heart's strong anchorage; And, all the vital spirits at once set free, The soul springs upward to eternity. But when the dissipated powers return'd To fill the seat of thought and life again, And Nature's fire, rekindling, brighter burn'd In either breast, and ran through every vein, Who can conceive the rapture? Who hath learn'd So well the excess of pleasure sow'd in pain, The joy that bursts in tears, or seeks relief In deep-drawn sighs, the natural voice of grief? And now the panic far and wide hath spread, And on their camp the routed Paynims pour; But night's dark curtain screen'd them as they fled, And the tired Paladins the chase give o'er: With painful steps their backward course they tread, Fired with the ardour of pursuit no more; They mourn the dead, yet wish their happier doom, Nor bless their own short respite from the tomb. But when, conspicuous through the gathering gloom, The lion banner burst upon their sight; When by the well-known crest and raven plume Of Aymon's house, the fair proportion'd height, The lordly port which Aymon's sons assume And none can doubt, they mark Montalban's knight; All fear and grief, all languor and all pain, All sense of woes endured, all thought of what remain, At once have fled; and through the knightly train Late so desponding, solemn, and so slow, Fresh pours the flood of life, as if again Creating Nature bade the current flow From the cold heart through every stagnant vein, And the glazed eyeballs with new lustre glow, Of some unburied corse, for many an hour Left vacant by the vivifying power. Dark falls the night, no stars her course attending, And lurid clouds portend a gloomier day: Oh who that sees it rise shall mark its ending? Oh who shall live, in after years to say What tides of precious blood their channels blending With streams accurst and vile, have roll'd their way, Dyeing that verdant field with crimson stain That thousand circling springs shall ne'er make green again? Yet at the last a prouder day shall dawn, O Roncesvalles! on thy blighted name; When Treason to her secret haunts withdrawn, Shall mourn her conquests past in present shame: Fresh laurels shall o'ercanopy the lawn With grateful shade, and fairest flowers of fame Start from each barren cleft and sun-burnt cave, To wreathe immortal chaplets for the brave. But not for France shall swell the solemn strain Of triumph;—not, degenerate France, for thee! Thy fame is past; and treason's foulest stain Blots out thy light of ancient chivalry. Lo! Britain leads the glorious chase, and Spain From all her mountain summits follows free, Leagued in just vengeance for a blacker crime Than e'er defiled the rolls of elder Time. Sleeps Arthur in his isle of Avalon? High favour'd Erin sends him forth once more To realize the dream of days far gone, The wizard strains of old Caer-merddhyn's lore. Another Rowland brings his legions on, The happier Rowland of an English shore; And thunders in the van with foot of flame Scotland's romantic champion gallant Græme. What mournful train, descending through the glade, “Breaks the long glories of my dazzled sight?” Rest, Paladin of England! Lowly laid Beneath the o'erarching pine-tree's towery height, Rest yet awhile! Erelong thy generous shade Shall witness with a soldier's proud delight, High deeds of kindred valour, and inspire In kindred bosoms old heroic fire! Or, haply, shall thy spirit, hovering near, With glorious breathings for immortal fame Fill the departing warrior's breast, and cheer With hope's bright dream his weak and suffering frame— Fair dream!—that o'er Cadogan's early bier Shed mildest influence, when with faint acclaim He hail'd his conquering friends, and closed his eye, Rejoicing, 'mid the shouts of victory! CANTO V. The funeral rites have ceased; and, lowly laid Where not a sound shall break his slumbers more, Astolpho sleeps beneath the pine-tree's shade; All his proud hopes extinct, his sorrows o'er. Yet the wild winds that mountain music made Amid the waving woods with ceaseless roar,— Though o'er the quiet dead they pass in vain, One solitary mourner hears the strain. Breaking the stillness of the unconscious sky, Is that the bridal voice that calls thee home? Ah! how unlike the festive minstrelsy That peal'd through Caradore's illumined dome! Ah! how unlike the softer melody Of love, faint murmuring through the grateful gloom! To thee, oh Oliver! the gentlest breath That stirs the pine's tall branches, whispers Death. That fatal morning's dawn how shall I sing? How paint the impending battle's horrid face? Have I not said that death is on the wing, And shall I not o'erleap the middle space? The bolt hath sped, and oped the sacred spring Whence flows the purest blood of Gallia's race; But never yet Orlando's fixéd mood Had alter'd, or roll'd back the vital flood;— Not when Bellande her blooming honour lost, And headless on the ground lay Neustria's pride; Not e'en when he, who loved his master most, And served him best, since hapless Baldwin died, Of all his youthful followers in the host, Good Sansonetto, perish'd at his side; It seem'd nor human fear, nor human woe Could move his soul again or make his sorrows flow. Yet once again that inmost soul must bleed For Oliver, his friend and better part; Oh! then he knew the doom of all decreed, And cursed the Paynim traitor from his heart: While thus the dying chief,—“In thought or deed If e'er our souls bore undivided part, O lead me where in death I may be known, Nor leave me, unrevenged, to die alone!” “I have no heart, without thee,” he replied, “In this perplext and dreary life to stay; I've bid adieu to daring joy and pride, And human Hope deserts my darkening day: Love only can the fall of life abide; Thy love, my Oliver, yet lights my way: O follow, Oliver, that guiding love, With me one faith, one hope, one will, to prove.” Thus said, they mingled in the thickest fight; Once more the dying warrior raised his blade, And, though the approach of death had dimm'd his sight, Through the mid ranks a bloody passage made: Close on the confines of eternal night, Still his sad friend with wondering eye survey'd Such deeds as might have graced life's vigorous day,— For the soul's fire survived the frame's decay. Thus through the storm of swords and spears they go, Still dealing vengeance and despair around: But Oliver, who now more faint and slow The heavy hand of Death oppressive found, Press'd towards his tent: the end of all his woe He felt approaching from that mortal wound. “Oh yet a little wait!” Orlando cries; “I'll sound my horn—assistance near us lies.” “My brother,” he replied, “there's now no need: My soul is hastening from its bonds to flee; It soars, expectant of the promised meed; It beats, it pants, it must, it will, be free—” More would his faltering tongue,—but Heaven decreed An instant change for immortality: Yet the last wish Orlando knew full well,— “Live thou! and guard my sister Aldabelle.” Now, when he saw the noble spirit fled, He seem'd on earth's wild coast alone to stray; And, sick at heart and sorrowful, he sped To gain a hillock that adjoining lay: And there he blew a blast so loud and dread, The Paynim host all trembled with dismay. Another, and another yet, he blew: With the third blast, that horn was burst in two. Then back he hasten'd to the battle field, As the sad widow'd sire suspends his grief, Returning from the funeral rite, to yield His little weeping family relief. E'en in that moment's space had Fate unseal'd New springs of sorrow to the afflicted chief: The desolating Fury had not spared Avino, Avolio, Gualtier, Egibard. Still Anselm rear'd his ponderous mace on high; Still Aymon's banner rode the battle wave; And Turpin, mid the Christian chivalry, Still held the sword to strike, the cross to save: But Clermont's horn, that shook the startled sky, New hope inspired to rouse the fainting brave, While to the Paynim host it seem'd to bear, In each successive blast, defeat, dismay, despair. At the first blast of that miraculous horn, That, league o'er league, round hill and vale resounded, By Fontarabian echos westward borne, And by the Atlantic billows back rebounded, Like some tired traveller, on the sudden torn From slumbers that have all his sense confounded, The Roman Emperor started from his throne, And sternly eyed the traitor Ganellon. “Fair speed the chase in Roncesvalles' glade!” The traitor cried;—“beneath the greenwood bough How many antlers, brave and tall, are laid Lowly on earth by Clermont's arrows now?” Gladly deceived, the momentary shade Of doubt and fear pass'd o'er the imperial brow; But Salamon still grasp'd his half-drawn sword, And Britain's king, and wise Bavaria's lord. But when the second blast that pierced the sky Had far and wide its scatter'd echos sent, From all the circle burst one general cry, And loud indignant clamour fill'd the tent: A hundred falchions from the scabbard fly, And all against the conscious traitor bent: The conscious traitor, yet unshaken, said “How well this day Anglante's shafts have sped!” Again it sounds—but Ganellon no more Affects the glozing speech and bold disguise: A shuddering tremor steals his senses o'er, And heavy clouds of guilt oppress his eyes; His straining eyeballs seek the expanded door Through which, unseen, a grisly phantom flies; Unseen by all beside,—for Conscience shows Such mockeries only to delude Heaven's foes. And well that fearful vision might appal And freeze the life-stream in a father's vein, Speaking of Baldwin's bloody funeral. It bore upon its front the battle stain, That marr'd his youthful graces, and, withal, Grasp'd in its hand the vest of purple grain,— That fatal vest which well the traitor knew,— Then, on him sternly frowning, slow withdrew. How pale he stands! how fixt his look, how strange! How self-condemn'd, who late so brave appear'd! In silent dread, all view'd that sudden change, Mysterious omen of the worst they fear'd: But not in all thine empire's widest range Breathed there a peasant, so by hope uncheer'd, As at that moment, noble Charles, to be Compared, in bitterness of soul, with thee. Who breaks the portals of the grave again, And glares so fiercely on the imperial throne? Not that the guest of a bewilder'd brain, Invisible to all but guilt alone: To all alike it stands confest and plain; And yet, among the living ne'er was known, Like meteors flashing from the northern sky, The withering flame that fired that sunken eye,— The sounds that, labouring in that hollow chest, As in some sepulchre the imprison'd wind, Thus the dark oracle of Fate express'd:— “It is too late, O man perverse and blind! Yes—thou mayst rend thy garment, beat thy breast, And round thy loins repentant sackcloth bind; Yes—thou mayst gird thy potent sword, display Thy banner, and lead forth thy proud array! “Vengeance may wake; and, wrapt in smouldering fire, E'en Saragossa's lofty towers may fall; Marsilius, and his line accurst, expire Amid the ruins of his tottering hall; All this, and more, by Heaven's eternal Sire May stand decreed: but Heaven can ne'er recall Thy fatal hour, O widow'd France! nor save Thy glories from disgrace, thy children from the grave. “It is too late to avert Astolpho's doom, Or heal thy wounds, thou gentlest Berlinghier! It is too late to close the greedy tomb That opens now its gates for Olivier. E'en thee, Orlando!—would that earthly fume That clouds my dying senses disappear, And leave my sight from doubt and error free,— My last sad funeral knell might sound for thee! “One vision yet—it soothes my parting soul— O sons of Aymon! brethren of my love!”— No more—those flaming orbs have ceased to roll, That breast to labour, and those lips to move; Through all the tent a solemn murmur stole, As fear with rage, with grief amazement strove: That lifeless corse, the eye's unnatural light Extinct, to memory gave Montalban's wizard knight. 'Tis said—but who the fearful truth can tell?— That in his hovering flight, 'twixt earth and sky, A startling peal, the well-known voice of Hell, Announced his league dissolved, his hour gone by: Then from his air-built car the enchanter fell, And, where he fell, in mortal trance did lie; Till Clermont's horn, with its awakening blast, Roused his prophetic rage to speak and breathe its last. Back to the field of blood, my wandering song, And wait the ending of that dismal fight! The wonders of the charméd horn too long Have staid thy pinions from their onward flight. Behold, where Aymon's sons the routed throng Still urge, impetuous, down the mountain's height, And Anselm follows in that glorious chase— But where is he, the leader of the race? Opprest with wounds and toil, the valiant knight Can now support his helmet's weight no more; Tired with the labours of so long a fight, Parcht by a burning thirst unfelt before: He now remember'd where, the former night, From a clear fount the crystal stream he bore; Thither he urged his steed, there sought repose, And wash'd his wounds, and rested from his woes. His faithful steed, that long had served him well In peace and war, now closed his languid eye, Kneel'd at his feet, and seem'd to say “Farewell! I've brought thee to the destined port, and die.” Orlando felt anew his sorrows swell When he beheld the gallant courser lie Stretch'd on the field, that crystal fount beside, Stiffen'd his limbs, and cold his warlike pride. And “O my much-loved steed, my generous friend, Companion of my better years!” he said; “And have I lived to see so sad an end Of all thy toils, and thy brave spirit fled? O pardon me, if e'er I did offend With hasty wrong that mild and faithful head!”— Just then, his eyes a momentary light Flash'd quick;—and closed again in endless night. Now when Orlando found himself alone, Upon the field he cast his swimming eyes, But there no kindred form, no friend well known, Of all his host, to glad his sight, arise: With undistinguish'd dead the mountains groan; A heap of slaughter, Roncesvalles lies: Oh, what a pang of grief oppress'd his brain, As his strain'd eyeballs rested on the slain! “Farewell,” he cried, “ye gallant souls thrice blest, Whose woes lie buried in that bloody tomb! For me, I know my fate, but cannot rest; Feel Death approaching, and he will not come. How peaceful now is thy distracted breast, My Oliver! how sweet Astolpho's doom! Oh yet some human pity feel for me, And aid my soul, just struggling to be free!” 'Twas then, as ancient chronicles have told, Orlando gazed upon his faithful blade, And thus address'd, as if of human mould— “When in the silent grave thy lord is laid, And ages o'er his sad remains have roll'd, O Durindana! let it ne'er be said, Thy noble steel, aye sacred to the right, Hath lent to Pagan hands its prostituted might.” He said, and, far his red right arm extending, Collected stood for one last dreadful shock: The sword, high whirl'd in air, and swift descending, Nor bent nor shiver'd on the marble rock, But cleaved its solid mass, asunder rending Even from the summit to the central block. The rudest peasant, in that valley born, Still shows the cloven crag and wondrous horn. In Roncesvalles' melancholy glade The cries of war were now no longer heard; And, ere the lingering star of day decay'd No Moorish banner o'er the waste appear'd: One tribute more, to Gano's treason paid, The dæmons at their hellish banquet cheer'd; Spent with fatigue and blood, at evening's close, Good Anselm's spirit fled to seek its long repose. The sons of Aymon and the martial priest Were now the last sad reliques of the brave: Together from the vain pursuit they ceased, Together sought Orlando's bloody grave. At length they found him, where, not yet released From mortal anguish, by that fountain wave, His toil-worn limbs reclined. In silent grief They stood collected round the expiring chief. But when Orlando raised his clouded sight, And saw Heaven's consecrated warrior near, A sacred joy diffused its kindling light, And bathed his face with many a grateful tear: Then, cleansed from blood, Heaven's own anointed knight Laid his pure hands on Clermont's humble peer, And blest him, in His holy name who gave Himself to death our ransom from the grave. This ended, to Rinaldo kneeling by A parting look of tenderness he sent, Who grasp'd his hand, but made no more reply— 'Twas the last look that on this earth he bent: Thenceforth, on Heaven alone he fix'd his eye, Fix'd, as the lights that gem the firmament; Yet, while his soul sprang upward, Love had share In every wish, and framed his latest prayer. Scarce had he offer'd up that silent prayer With sighs and tears, and breathed his last desire, When on the dying knight, with sudden glare, Flash'd from the sun three beams of heavenly fire. His friends kneel round him with dejected air, Like children at the death-bed of their sire; No sounds the dread and solemn silence broke, Save when deep sighs the heart's sad language spoke. Soft music, mingling with that heavenly light, In sweet low murmurs stole upon their ears; And, like some dying gale of balmy night, A spirit seem'd descending from the spheres. Orlando raised his intellectual sight, When to his ravish'd sense confest appears He, who from heaven to our benighted earth Bore the glad tidings of a Saviour's birth. And thus that vision said, or seem'd to say, “Thine offering is received, thy soul forgiven! Wait but a little space—the appointed day Restores thee to thy mourning friends in heaven. To those beloved on earth, for whom you pray, Shall special messengers of peace be given, To guard your king in his declining years, And these your fellow-soldiers and your peers. “Bright with eternal youth and fadeless bloom, Thine Aldabelle thou shalt behold once more, Partaker of a bliss beyond the tomb With her whom Sinai's holy hills adore; Crown'd with fresh flowers, whose colour and perfume Surpass what Spring's rich bosom ever bore— Thy mourning widow here she will remain, And be in Heaven thy joyful spouse again.” With look seraphic, raised and fix'd on high, He seem'd transfigured from this earthly vest, And holding sweet communion with the sky: O happy end! O soul supremely blest! At last he hung his languid head to die, And the freed spirit left his holy breast; But first the pommel of his sword he laid Fix'd to his heart, his arms across the blade. The sound of distant thunder shook the skies, Play'd round the hills, and in the valley died; From snowy clouds bright starry meteors rise, And through mid air celestial lustres glide, And liquid flames, too fierce for mortal eyes; To sweetest harps harmonious notes replied; Such notes as to the Heaven of Heavens aspire, The holy hymnings of the angelic choir. The knights, who silent saw their champion die, Stood rapt in fervent trance upon the plain; Lost to themselves, in Contemplation's eye They rise at once their radiant thrones to gain; Till ceased the strains of dulcet psalmody, And long and loud Hosannas closed the strain. So stood the sage of old, and so adored, When up to Heaven Elijah's chariot soar'd. When Charles beheld that field of blood, he cast His eyes towards Roncesvalles, and exclaim'd, “Because in thee the fame of France is past, Through every age be thou with curses named! So long as this vile world and Time shall last, Be desolating barrenness proclaim'd Thy lofty hills and spreading vales around, And Heaven's own lightnings blast the accurséd ground!” But when he reach'd the fatal mountain's base, Where, at the fount, Rinaldo watch'd, the dead, More lamentable tears bedew'd his face: The stiffen'd corse he kiss'd, embraced, and said, “O blessed soul! look from the realms of grace Upon this old and miserable head; And, if all wrongs be not forgotten there, For peace and gracious pardon hear my prayer! “Where is the faith, my son, I bade thee prove? The pledge, in happier days received and given? O shade adored! if aught of human love Or human pity may survive in Heaven, Restore me, from thy glorious seat above, As the dear token of offence forgiven, That sword with which I made thee knight and count, Even as thou erst didst swear at Aspramount!” 'Twas so ordain'd, that, at his sovereign's word, Orlando's body rose from earth once more, And kneel'd before his ancient king and lord With solemn reverence as in days of yore; Stretch'd forth his hand and yielded back the sword, The same he held at Aspramount before: Then, with a smile, to Heaven the spirit fled; The corse fell back, and lay for ever dead. O'er Charles's limbs a sudden tremor ran, Something betwixt a thrilling awe and love: By the cold hand he grasp'd the sainted man, And felt assured of happier life above. A holy horror every breast began To seize, and even Rinaldo's soul to prove The power of Fear, while, humbly kneeling round, They kiss'd with bended face the sacred ground. But who shall say how wretched Alda mourn'd Her lord and brother on their timeless bier? “Ye, blessed souls, to kindred light return'd, Have left me all alone and darkling here, Me, once the happiest wife on earth, adorn'd With all that Heaven approves or man holds dear, Crown'd with the love of the most noble knight That ever mounted steed or dared the fight. “O my loved husband, father, friend, farewell! Ne'er shall the world behold thy peer again; So form'd in camps and cities to excel, So mild in peace, so dreadful on the plain! Faithful in life and death, thine Aldabelle Swears, by thy bones inhumed at Aquisgrane, This constant heart, that only breathed for thee, Shall live devoted to thy memory.” IMITATIONS AND PARODIES. SONG.—“COULD A MAN BE SECURE.” Could a man be aware Of the turmoil and care That a life of ambition attend, Would he not cast away Every thought of to-day, And trifle and dream without end? Were the miser but told, Once or ere he grow old, “All the treasure you leave will be lost— All the wealth that you've stored Can no premium afford To your ashes, nor profit your ghost”— Could the soldier's stern eye 'Mid the battle descry, Thro' the cannon's loud thunder and smoke, What a shade of a shade Is the idol he made, And the altar he built, what a joke— Could the sage, nigh his urn, His vain learning unlearn, But this one piece of knowledge to scan; That, howe'er he may prize The keen sight of his eyes, Yet the blindest of creatures is man— Would the miser persist Still in closing his fist, The soldier his phantom embrace, Or again at his book The philosopher look, And the same endless diagrams trace? Then no longer upbraid That boon Nature has made Stupid mortals to delve and to spin; Were their labours untried, And their books laid aside, They'd soon fade and grow rotten within. FROM THE LAY OF A TROUBADOUR. Ladye! for truth I you it tell That God and Love accord right well, Respect and Homage God doth prize, And true Love doth not them despise. God hateth pride and falsity, And true Love loveth loyalty. In courteous 'haviour God delighteth, And gentle Love the same ne'er slighteth. God listens to a worthy prayer, And true Love shutteth not his ear. SONG.—“SINCE FIRST I SAW YOUR FACE.” O lady, could I e'er behold That face so brightly beaming, And not life's sunny hours regret When infant Love lay dreaming Upon thy breast of driven snow, Beneath thine eye's blue languish?— But, no! no! no! thy heart was safe; It cared not for his anguish. The slighted boy at last awoke From that distracted slumber, And since has toy'd in sunny bowers 'Mongst beauties without number. Yet still if by his pathway glides That form at evening lonely, Love every later dream forgets, His first remember'd only. So wandering spirits, are we told, By sin from glory sunder'd, If but a gale blow o'er them, fraught With sweets from Eden plunder'd, The furrow'd lines of guilt and care Are at the moment vanish'd, And all their native heaven returns, As if they'd ne'er been banish'd. CHARADE. A voice of wailing heard and loud lament From Sinai's rocks to fruitful Lebanon— The awful warning of destruction sent To Nineveh the great, and Babylon— Ruin, and utter desolation; Thence to all nations, in the dark eclipse Floundering and sinking, of religion's sun, Denounced tremendous by the hallow'd lips Of him, the inspiréd bard that wrote the Apocalypse— Behold my First. My Second lies conceal'd In words impervious to the noon-tide beam Where erst the mighty prophet who reveal'd The monarch of Assyria's mystic dream, And thence, borne onward by the viewless stream Of unborn ages, to the searching eye Of Faith has given its widest, amplest theme, Was doom'd in youth by tyrant power to lie A prey to fiercest beasts, who growl'd and pass'd him by. —Both grandly dark—Behold yet darker frown Through the thick gloom of ages past away, Wearing the semblance of a kingly crown, With streaming beard, and locks of iron gray; Grim-visaged potentate, whose bloody sway Crimsons the eternal snows that gird the pole; Whose name yet lives remember'd in the day When low in dust repentant bigots roll— Low, and with ashes soil'd—behold! you have my Whole. THE ROADMAKERS: A DOLEFUL BALLAD FOR THE YEAR 1825. Tune—“Ye gentlemen of England.” Ye road-makers of England, Who sit and plan at ease, Ah! little do ye think upon Our cherish'd lawns and trees! Give ear unto the gentlemen, And they will plainly show, All their cares and their fears, When a-measuring you go! This goodly land of freedom, With all its bowers and halls, Is turning fast to turnpike roads, And prisons and canals. The sylvan elves and fairies Have vanish'd long ago; Else what cries would arise When a-mapping it you go. How merrily we jogged it O'er breezy hill and down, Till grateful rest, at eventide, Our daily toil did crown! Now, all our roads must level be; Our pleasant hills laid low; Whilst the mail, through each vale, Helter-skeltering doth go. Our music's sole provider Must be the twanging horn, Now every thrush has left its bush, Each nightingale its thorn. Then to the sound of coaches, Since brooks have ceased to flow, Long and deep be your sleep Whilst a-rolling it you go. Here freedom once was cherish'd, And Englishmen were bold To call their homes their castles, and Their lands secure to hold. But you despise our liberties, And laugh to scorn our wo, O'er our land, act in hand, Whilst a-parcelling you go. Our lords and knights of parliament May grant what you require, While you but press to dispossess The humble country squire: But keep from their park palings, or Full soon they'll make you know How they'll fight for their right, If a-levelling you'd go. You prate of public spirit, And private ends pursue: Our fathers fought at Agincourt, Their sons at Waterloo. Our woods, our bought inheritance, Their blood hath made to grow; And we'll flinch not an inch, Though a bullying you go. If tyranny assails us, When England is at war, From any vaunting foreigners We fear not wound or scar. Then for our tyrants of the spade, The pickaxe and the hoe, All prepared stand on guard, Whilst a-rampaging they go. Now courage, all brave gentlemen, Your honours forth advance, And yield to ne'er a despot yet, From Scotland nor from France. M?m would reduce us all To break up stones, we know; May our stones break his bones, When a-hammering he'll go. ADDITIONAL STANZAS FOR 1836. But now M?m's reign is o'er, And railways take his place, And fourteen miles an hour, or more, Is deem'd a snail's foot-pace. “Annihilate both space and time, To ease a lover's wo,” None need pray, now-a-day, While a-steaming it we go. If so the price of iron Is risen cent. per cent. (As one from Sheffield, t'other day, Announced in parliament,) What wonder, then, that foundry-men, And lords of mines also, O'er the land, hand in hand With the levellers do go? Now town with country lunches, And country dines with town, And England is the picture of The world turn'd upside down. Their griding irons pierce our souls, Their furnace makes us glow,— May B?l broil as well If a-tunnelling he'll go! SONG.—“THERE'S NOUGHT BUT CARE ON EVERY HAN'.” —(BURNS.) There's nought but iron on every han', On every road one passes, O! What signifies the life of man, That mow'd down like the grass is, O! Hark! how it crashes, O! Whiz! how it flashes, O! Now off we be, and what care we For broken bones and gashes O? The war'ly race may riches chase; But should their han's environ, O, Great heaps untold of minted gold, 'Twere naething to bar-iron, O. Hark, &amp;c. Then gi'e to me on 'change to see The shares look brisk and cheerie, O, Geese, women, then, and pigs, and men, May a' gae tapsalteerie, O. Hark, &amp;c. A' ye wha jeer, now haud your sneer; Their sense your sense surpasses, O: The wisest man the warl' e'er saw Was naething to the asses, O. Hark, &amp;c. Now Exe may change her clouted cream With Bristol for molasses, O. So be our theme, first, iron and steam, And, after, men and asses, O. Hark! how it crashes, O! Whiz! how it flashes, O! Now off we be, and what care we For broken bones and gashes, O? BALLAD—IN IMITATION OF DR. WATTS. “Why should I deprive my neighbour Of his goods against his will, Though in works of honest labour I would fain be busy still?” Such the Sunday lesson taught us, Sitting on our nurse's knee, When the good old dame besought us To be like the busy bee. Now our neighbour's goods and chattels— Nay, his house and land also, Are no more than children's rattles, Weigh'd with “bono publico.” Now 'tis all—“push on, keep moving!” Iron without, and coals within— Levelling is term'd “improving,” And to covet held no sin. Sure there's somewhat most bewitching Breaking up another's land; Tunneling, embanking, ditching, Act of Parliament in hand. Once the realm was all o'er-ridden By a lordly Nimrod crew: Now to hunt's a thing forbidden By the broker and the Jew. Aristocracy was once the Plague that ravaged our abodes; But our plague is, for the nonce, the Joint-stock-ocracy of roads. THE ROAD TO GLORY. Tune—“The blue bonnets over the border.” Up, up, sons of Utility! Up, and be stirring, boys, all round the borders! Down, down, rank and gentility! What are ye for, but to execute orders? Yield, aristocracy! rule joint-stock-ocracy! Drive, ye share-holders, your ploughshares before ye! Mount, and make ready, then, colliers and foundry men— Rail-roads and waggon trains whisk ye to glory. Rouse, rouse, Manchester, and Brummagem, Sheffield, Newcastle, Leeds, Durham, and Bristol! Burn lords! ransack and rummage 'em, And at their heads hold your radical pistol! Yield, aristocracy, &amp;c. March, march, Force and Rapacity! Push on, incessant indefinite movement! Join hands, Fraud and Mendacity! Who'll see your face thro' the mask of improvement? Yield, aristocracy, &amp;c. Speed, speed, lawyers and riflemen! Now is the time for all manner of jobbery. Look to yourselves—never stand on a trifle, men! “Publicum bonum” will sanction the robbery. Yield, aristocracy! rule joint-stock-ocracy! Drive, ye share-holders, your ploughshares before ye! Mount, and make ready, then, colliers and riflemen— Rail-roads and waggon trains whisk ye to glory. A NEW SONG UPON WHIG AND TORY. Tune—“A cobbler there was.” Come listen, my boy, and I'll tell you a story How 't has fared with old England betwixt Whig and Tory. Whig stands for sour milk, as I've heard 'em declare, And Tory's a savage, as rude as a bear, Derry down, down, down derry down. The Whigs first were Round-heads—so call'd, 'tis averr'd, From cropping their poll, tho' they scarce trimm'd their beard; While the bold Cavaliers, as they dash'd thro' the throng, Kept their whiskers well shorn, though they wore their hair long. Derry down, &amp;c. These Round-heads—it happen'd—cut off a king's head; But the Cavaliers brought a new king in his stead: When the first look'd so black for the loss of their power, That the others declared they turn'd all the milk sour, Derry down, &amp;c. Now the proud Cavaliers, in the midst of their glories, Look'd so fierce with their wigs, that the Whigs call'd 'em Tories; And king James having leagued with the Pope, as they say, Whig and Tory united to turn him away. Derry down, &amp;c. Then under brave Orange the Whigs ruled the roast, And the Tories were voted rank scoundrels at most. But—sly fellows—they managed to get good Queen Anne over, And so stuck to their posts, till king George came from Hanover. Derry down, &amp;c. Now down fell the Tory, and up rose the Whig, And they ran the whole nation a deuce of a rig; But poor Whig fell asleep while he guarded the fruit, And sly Tory stole back, with the princess and Bute. Derry down, &amp;c. Since then—to make short of this Whiggamore story— Down, down, went the Whig, and up, up, went the Tory; Till the Whigs, to get back, put to sea in a storm, And braved Revolution in urging Reform. Derry down, &amp;c. Now let Whig and Tory be heard of no more; But true Englishmen join, as they once did before, To stick to the ship, having sworn to defend her; So a fig for the devil, the Pope, and Pretender. Derry down, down, down derry down. SACRED AND SCRIPTURAL. PROVERBS, CHAP. I. v. 20–31. Wisdom aloud proclaimeth. In the street Her voice is heard aloud— In the chief place, where men assembled meet; And to the listening crowd Thus from betwixt the expanded gates gives warning: “How long, ye fools, will ye Embrace simplicity?— How long, ye scorners, take delight in scorning? Turn ye at my reproof. Behold! for your behoof On you my inmost spirit I will outpour, And spread from shore to shore. Because I call'd, and ye refused—because My hand I stretchéd forth, and no man heeded— But ye have set at naught my counsell'd laws, And spurn'd the lore that from my lips proceeded; I too will laugh for that ye inly bleed; I too will mock when fear, as desolation, Cometh upon you, and with whirlwind speed Swift devastation. Then shall they call on me, and I refuse; Shall seek me early, but they shall not find; For that they hated knowledge, nor did choose The fear of the Lord their God to keep in mind. They would none of my counsel; they despised All my reproof; so may they freely reap That they have sown; and, what they have devised, Be theirs to keep!” ECCLESIASTICUS, CHAP. I. All Wisdom is from Thee, O Lord! with Thee Abideth ever. The drops of rain that fall—the sand of the sea— The sum of days that makes eternity, Who shall endeavour To number?—who, to measure Heaven's height, Earth's breadth, the depth of ocean infinite, The boundless stream Of Wisdom—first of all created things— Wisdom, that from the eternal fountain springs Of God supreme? Her ways are everlasting laws—to whom Have the recesses of her secret womb Been e'er reveal'd? Who knows her solemn councils? who so blest, To whom she hath herself made manifest, And kept conceal'd From all beside?—Yet is there One, most wise, One, greatly to be fear'd, who in the skies Hath built his throne; Who Wisdom's self did into being call, And saw, and number'd, and hath since thro' all His works made known— And, most of all, to them that live, and move, And their Almighty Father know and love, Hath given her for their own. The fear of the Lord is Honour, Glory, Gladness; A crown of happiness without alloy; The fear of the Lord dispelleth grief and sadness, And giveth length of years, increase of joy. Who fears the Lord, with him it shall be well E'en to the last, and peace upon his death bed dwell. The fear of the Lord is Wisdom's first creation, Found with the faithful yet within the womb, And will continue with them to the tomb, And with their seed upon secure foundation. WISDOM OF SOLOMON, CHAP. II. Thus said the heathen, in their reasonings vain; “Man's life is short, or but prolonged in pain: In death no remedy, no comfort, lies, And from the grave we may not look to rise. Born to all chance, on all adventures driven, The sport of fortune or capricious heaven, We pass away, and are no longer seen, And leave no record that we once have been. Our breath is smoke, our heart's warm pulse a spark, Soon kindled, soon extinct, then all is dark; Consumed to ashes our poor house of clay, Our spirit vanish'd like soft air away; Our name erased from Time's unfaithful page; Our works unnoticed by the rising age. We die, alas! and leave no trace behind, Like empty vapour driven before the wind, Or mists that, gathering thick at close of night, Are scatter'd by the day's increasing light. And, when this vision is dissolved at last, This airy, trifling, fleeting shadow past, A seal is put upon the funeral urn, And Fate itself prohibits our return. “Come, then, enjoy the hours that yet are thine, Give thy full soul to perfumes, baths, and wine; Let youth enhance the moments as they fly, And let no flower of painted spring go by! With early rose-buds let us crown our head, Ere yet their full-blown leaves be torn and shed! No pleasure pass untried, nor dear delight— The festive day, the soft voluptuous night; Leave through the world the tokens of your bliss, This is our portion, and our lot is this. “Let us the poor and righteous man oppress, Nor spare the widow nor the fatherless, Nor hold in reverence grey antiquity— But let our strength the law of justice be. That which is weak is ever worthless found— Let then our toils the righteous man surround; For that he thwarts our arts, and doth prevent By stern reproof our lawless will's intent; And boasts himself of knowledge all divine, And claims descent from God's peculiar line. Nay—e'en his face it irks us to behold; For not like other men's his days are told: His ways are of a different fashion,—He Proclaims the end of the just man bless'd to be. But let us see if so his words be sooth: For, say the just man be God's child in truth, Then surely God will help, and set him free From powerless hands of human enemy.” Such thoughts they did conceive, by sin made blind. God's hidden mysteries were not in their mind; The meed of goodness 'twas not theirs to earn, Nor the reward of blameless souls discern. For God made man immortal—form'd to be The image of His own Eternity. [Great Universal Father—Thou] Great Universal Father—Thou Whose form no eye hath seen, Whose seat we image in the space Of the infinite Serene! Thy name with reverential awe Be ever hallow'd here, And not a thought profane the place Where angels come not near. In lowliest confidence we wait For thine appointed day: “Thy kingdom come! Thy will be done!” This only let us pray. Thy kingdom come! Thy will be done On earth as 'tis in Heaven; And what our feeble nature craves Be in like measure given. Forgive us, Father, O forgive Our still increasing debt Of sin, as We forgiveness grant To those who Us forget. When stormy passion o'er the brink Our tossing souls would urge, O lead us not within the gulf, Of that o'erwhelming surge! But from the power of Sin and Death, The soul's worst enemy, Deliver us—Thou who alone Canst set the prisoner free! For only Thine the kingdom is, And Thine the sovereign sway, And Thine the glory that abides Through everlasting day. [Father of mercies, God of might] Father of mercies, God of might, By whom all things were made; We from thy paths of truth and light Like wandering sheep have stray'd; Lost, but for Thee, our stedfast hold, All-seeing guardian of the fold. The vain devices and desires Of hearts propense to wrong, The flickerings of delusive fires, We follow'd have too long: Against Thy wise and holy laws We have rebell'd without a cause. The good Thou willest us to do, That we have left undone; The evil that Thou bidd'st eschew, We into it have run; And none amongst us can be found, But all is tainted, all unsound. Yet, Lord, have mercy!—Mercy, Lord, On us, thy humbled race! To them that own their guilt accord The riches of thy grace. Spare them that in true lowliness Of soul their inmost thoughts confess. Spare us, good Lord! save and restore According to thy will, Declared in promises of yore, And sure and constant still, By Him—to make the charter good, Who seal'd it with his precious blood. For whose dear sake, O Father! grant Our lives henceforth may prove The mercies of thy covenant, The wonders of thy love. Righteous, and pure from sinful blame, In honour of Thy glorious name. [Almighty God! before Thy Throne] Almighty God! before Thy Throne We kneel for grace to cast away The robes of darkness, and put on The armour of eternal day; Even now, in life's meridian way, The spring-tide of our mortal prime, Or e'er we sink in swift decay, And nature's doom is seal'd by Time. Even now, to this benighted clime When Thine own Son, in humble strain Descending, left his seat sublime To help us, struggling with our chain: That, when he shall return again The judge of quick and dead to be, We may, through His great love, attain A glorious immortality. [Thou Great First cause of life and light] Thou Great First cause of life and light, Unsearchable by mortal sight, From whose perpetual fountains flow All we enjoy, and all we know; Who in our days hast deign'd dispense A larger view of Providence, And on the thirsty nations pour'd The boundless riches of Thy word; O grant that we may so embrace The means allotted by Thy grace, So read Thy will, and so improve The stores of Thine exhaustless love; That, by the help of thoughts resign'd, By patient humbleness of mind, By daily prayer before Thy throne, By pious trust in Thee alone, We may attain that blissful coast, Where hope in certainty is lost, And truth reveals, through every line, The wonders of Thy vast design. “EVIL, BE THOU MY GOOD.” —MILTON. “Evil, be thou my good”—in rage Of disappointed pride, And hurling vengeance at his God, The apostate angel cried. “Evil, be thou my good”—repeats, But in a different sense, The christian, taught by faith to trace The scheme of Providence. So deems the hermit, who abjures The world for Jesus' sake; The patriot midst his dungeon bars, The martyr at his stake. For he who happiness ordain'd Our being's only end— The God who made us, and who knows Whither our wishes tend, The glorious prize hath station'd high On virtue's hallow'd mound, Guarded by toil, beset by care, With danger circled round. Virtue were but a name, if vice Had no dominion here, And pleasure none could taste, if pain And sorrow were not near. The fatal cup we all must drain Of mingled bliss and woe; Unmix'd, the cup would tasteless be, Or quite forget to flow. Then cease to question Heaven's decree, Since Evil, understood, Is but the tribute nature pays For Universal Good. If the concluding couplet should assume the air of a paradox, the author has only to plead, that nothing less pointed would express all the meaning he intends to convey. OCCASIONAL VERSES. EPITAPH. [When at the holy altar's foot is given] When at the holy altar's foot is given Some blushing maiden to the enamour'd youth, Whose long tried honour, constancy, and truth, Yield the fair promise of an earthly heaven, Though to far distant friends and country led, Fond parents triumph mid the tears they shed. Shall we then grieve that a celestial spouse Hath borne this virgin treasure from our sight, To share the glories of the eternal light, The end of all our prayers and all our vows? We should rejoice—but cannot as we ought. Great God! forgive the involuntary fault. ANOTHER EPITAPH. Thou'rt gone, my Jane—for ever gone— And in thy silent urn Can holy rapture breathe no more, Nor fond affection burn. Mute are the strains—for ever mute— On which we lingering hung, While adoration swell'd each heart, And fetter'd every tongue. Yet still on one—one sister breast Does the remembrance lie, Vivid—as in the deepest lake We view the brightest sky; Thence ne'er to be effaced, till day And all its tints expire; And then—O God! with her to join In Thine immortal choir? TO A SON ENTERING COLLEGE. “Go forth, my boy! and on the swelling tide Of honourable fame securely ride! Go forth! and may a father's blessing fill Thy prosperous sail, and aid the steersman's skill, With power to shield from passion's tempest sway, From pleasure's hidden shoals avert thy way, Break pride's dull waveless calm, and bid retreat Each eddying gust of folly and conceit; So on thy brow exulting we may see The glorious prize—the wreath of victory!” Presumptuous wish—in doting fondness bred! Unthinking prayer, recall'd as soon as sped! Condemn'd by reason's voice, religion's power, And proved delusive every passing hour. In different strains experience bids arise, Affection's offer'd incense to the skies. “O God! receive, protect, and bless my son! And, whatsoe'er Thy will, that will be done. I ask but that Thou teachest all to pray— The rest be Thine to give or take away. Vouchsafe him health, if such Thy pleasure be; And grant that he may use in honouring Thee! If not, in sickness may he still be Thine, And through the body's pains the soul refine. “If happiness consist with length of days, Long life be his, devoted to Thy praise! But, whatsoe'er—or long, or short, his doom— Should parents' tears bedew his early tomb, Or children's children follow to the grave, Be present Thou, Omnipotent to save! “If thou hast form'd him in thy purpose high, A mark conspicuous for the world's broad eye, O let him honour'd live, lamented die! But, if Thou willest that his heart be tried By disappointed hope and wounded pride, By cold neglect, or scorn more hard than hate, Attendants of a low or fallen estate, O make his spirit be resigned, and free To hug retreat, and welcome privacy: Oblivion's hermit portion bid him share; But plant content and resignation there! “Thy grace to aid each generous thought impart, Invigorate the mind, keep pure the heart; On Honour's sun-like form to fix his sight, Firm as yon eagle's in his mountain flight; Yet rather brave the world's contempt, than be By conscience stricken, or disown'd by Thee! “Let the bright star of reason's cloudless day Beam on his soul with unobstructed ray, Expand its powers, exalt its high desires, And purge its weakness with etherial fires: Full in his sight set virtue's sacred shrine, And make him worthier heaven, as wholly Thine!” FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM. ENTITLED “RETROSPECTION.” To-day I enter on my fiftieth year. My spring of Life is past—in swift career Summer rolls down apace; and winter's blast Will soon shake off the few green leaves that last. The rapid foot of Time I may not chide; Rather myself, who have so vainly tried To strip some plumage from his wing, and raise A trophied monument of deathless praise. Yet this were pride—pride only—in the dress That Lucifer best loves, of lowliness. Ah no! far wiser were it to survey In sober retrospect my travell'd way— To note each blessing of my favour'd lot, —Too thankless oft received, or heeded not— But, chief, that thou, &amp;c. “Praise doth not always to desert belong— The race to speed—the battle to the strong.” Thus, haply, love too partial might persuade: But truth severe, in memory's garb array'd, The fond deceit indignantly repels, While of false hope and wasted strength she tells, Of mis-directed aims, and toil mis-spent, Talents for interest given, but kept as lent; Means unembraced, occasions unemploy'd, Pleasures unwisely used, and half enjoy'd: And when—as faint I climb the rugged road, “So distant wherefore still from Fame's abode?” Stern conscience asks, “and why so poorly sped?”— I've nought to answer, but must hang my head. Yet do the years seem hours, or scarce so long, Since on this chequer'd scene of right and wrong, Of stern debate, and animated strife, Where passions, good and evil, all are rife, I enter'd first amid the bustling throng; Nor heeded then my own prophetic song That pointed to some lone sequester'd bower, Where I might linger out life's evening hour. Ambition! honour! are ye empty breath? Is there no refuge from life's ills but death? Not so I thought while following year by year, The airy phantoms your enchantments rear: These busy peopling the unreal void With hopes illusive, ne'er to be enjoy'd; Those shedding noxious dews o'er every sense, And steeping thought in mental indolence. And yet, e'en then, in youth's ecstatic hour, While Fancy held with undiminish'd power Her empire o'er my breast, full well she knew To shade the brightest forms her pencil drew With sombre tinctures of funereal hue. But, haply, still amid that waste of thought, Some wiser lessons, by reflection taught, Sprang timely forth—I learn'd that man is born For nobler ends than but to joy or mourn; That life is given, not just to feel and taste, Then lose in slumber, or in idlesse waste; A little folding of the arms to sleep— A little space o'er imaged woes to weep. Words are the wheels of thought, by Heaven impell'd; Such as of old the sacred bard beheld, What time he sat by Chebar's silent strand, Amongst the captives in Chaldæan land; Whither the Spirit directs still made to go, With Him to soar above, or sink below. Yet better far to want the gift of speech— All godlike though it be when used to preach The words of wisdom, virtue, knowledge, sense, To move by pathos, fire by eloquence, By sweet persuasion to constrain, or roll The tide of just invective o'er the soul, Command the right, or reprobate the wrong, Give courage to the weak, and judgment to the strong— Aye—better far to want it, than employ In falsehood's cause—to flatter and destroy, Pervert the law, confound the fact, or raise Dishonouring trophies or ill-measured praise— Nay, better than to spend in idle flow Of fond unmeaning phrases, or bestow In waste of words, while pining suitors shame The court's delay, and justice bears the blame; To whine in maudlin cant, or loosely prate Of all things save the subject of debate; Regardless of each sign of just rebuke— The hapless adversary's hopeless look; The yawn that justice vainly strives to hide; The long long list of causes still untried; Rapt in one sole perfection—deaf and blind To all without, around, before, behind. Nor this alone, of all the gifts that start For wealth and power, did nature fail to impart: When in half angry, half indulgent mood, The cup of Fancy's mingled ill and good She bad me freely drink, the sorceress knew That draught of bliss was dash'd with poison too; That, never wholly blest, whose favour'd lips The nectar touch, the wormwood also sips. Imagination's willing slave, he flies Too oft from stagnant life's realities, To the bright regions of the upper air, Content to starve, so he inhabit there. But e'en this glorious error was not mine— O think not heaven e'er meant the immortal mind A mere machine, in ceaseless round to grind Food for the loud-tongued wranglers of the bar, Or forge the weapons of forensic war. Dare rather trust that man was made to use The talents it hath lent for nobler views Than such as these—commission'd high to soar Beyond the fane where Mammon's sons adore— Superior to the grovelling herd obscene, Born but to serve where Avarice sits as queen, And, glorying in their crime, who loud declare Their base indifference whose the badge they wear— Alike to them, whom Slavery stamps her own, Whether they bow at Truth's or Falsehood's throne; Just or unjust—who serve with equal zest (If equal pay) the oppressor, and the opprest. Patriots there are—e'en now—but few or none Who take their stand at duty's post alone; Who dare appeal to men as men—the good And true—for all existing—understood By all. Their foes are better taught than they— E'en Satan's self has learn'd that wiser way, By system'd force the human will to bend. Virtue and truth, firm fix'd, will, in the end (Doubtless,) prevail; but wavering good is still No match for resolute, consistent ill. O for some wise, some potent voice, to make The startled soul at duty's call awake! There are, who, hearing what these notes proclaim, May brand the preacher with the zealot's name; May term him Superstition's slave and tool, Or, bred themselves in rancour's narrow school, Write him down hypocrite. Rash men, forbear— Remembering what he is, and what ye are— God's children all—the secret mind unknown To all, but him who form'd it—God alone. The mind!—mysterious essence—subtlest spark— Of power to pierce the chambers, vast and dark, Of death's profoundest cave—yet oftener doom'd Amongst the living to remain entomb'd, As in a sepulchre of breathing clay; Instinct the body's mandates to obey, But aimless as the dead, and uninform'd as they. Wo to the man in whose distrustful mind Power, virtue, freedom, no admittance find, Because unmix'd they never yet were view'd With sin, with weakness, and with servitude! In the wide fields of science soon we learn The things by nature separate to discern: So, by like reason, in the moral state, We must discern, that we may separate; And in the right discerning good from ill Begins the task of separation still. What in all ages, everywhere, hath been By all believed, although unfelt, unseen By outward sense, accept; nor ask for more Than patriarch, saint, or prophet held of yore. Not on cold logic rests the christian plan— It is engrafted in the heart of man; Fix'd in his memory; and rooted there With the dear image of his mother's chair, Her first remember'd accents—'tis self-proved— Witness the power by which ourselves are moved; Or as the sun by his own light is seen. Thus sense suggests; and reason steps between To separate what we feel from what we know. That says it is—but this, it must be so. The reasoning faculty, and that we name The understanding, are no more the same, Than are a maxim and a principle— A truth eternal, indestructible, And a bare inference from facts, how great Soe'er their number, magnitude, and weight. —At best, how fallible!—who sees a rose, Sees that 'tis red; and what he sees he knows. Day after day, at each successive hour, Where'er he treads, the same love-vermeil'd flower Blooms in his path. What wonder if he draw, From facts so proved, a universal law, And deem all roses of the self-same hue? And this is knowledge; yet 'tis only true Until a white rose gleams upon his view. Where is his reason then?—his science, bought With long experience? All must come to nought. So, when creation's earliest day had run, And Adam first beheld the new-born sun Sink in the shrouded west, the deepening gloom He watch'd, all hopeless of a morn to come. Another evening's shades advancing near He mark'd with livelier hopes, yet dash'd by fear. Another—and another—hopes prevail; Thousands of years repeat the wondrous tale: Yet where is man's assurance, that the light Of day will break upon the coming night? Without all sense of God, eternity, Absolute truth, volition, liberty, Good, fair, just, infinite—think, if you can, Of such a being in the form of man; What but the animal remains?—endow'd (May be) with memory's instinctive crowd Of images—but man is wanting there, His very essence, unimpressive air; And, in his stead, a creature subtler far Than all the beasts that in the forest are, Or the green field, but also cursed above Them all—condemn'd that bitterest curse to prove— “Upon thy belly creep, and, for thy fee, Eat dust, so long as thou hast leave to be.” There needs no hell of flames—for, if the will, (Law of our nature,) be not with us still— If from our reason that dissever'd be, From fancy, understanding, memory— No hell conceived by ignorance or zeal Can equal that unbodied spirits must feel From mental anarchy—from senses wrought To conscious madness. Who can bear the thought? And yet, how doubt it, grant there be a state— Nor life, nor death, but intermediate— Where souls, discharged their prison-house of clay, And clothed in robes impervious to decay, Await their final doom?—If this be plain From holy writ, to seek elsewhere were vain. If human virtue—(how imperfect found E'en in the best who walk this earthly round!) Shall in those unknown realms be further tried, Enlarged, refined, exalted, purified; If human wisdom—(e'en in man most wise, How ill prepared for commune with the skies!) Shall there be given with stronger wing to steer Its venturous flight to an immortal sphere; Or if, our earthly pilgrimage complete, And place appointed nigh the mercy seat By purchase made secure, we there shall rest, Of future joy by present faith possest, Not blest, but only waiting to be blest— (Passive fruition!) none can ever know Whose feet yet lingering press this sod below; Unless—(as hath been told, and as I fain Would think) in blissful intervals from pain, Are sometimes sent, to spirits half set free, Bright, transient glimpses of eternity, Withheld from all beside, of power to shed Serenest raptures o'er the dying head. What most affects us—what we most desire, Yet dread, to learn, and tremblingly inquire, Of this uncertain state, this dreamy sea, Is, if the soul, from mortal bonds set free, Still lingers round the spot it once held dear, Partakes the joy, arrests the falling tear, Exalts the rapture, mitigates the pain, Of those it loved, and hopes to meet again. —Deep mysteries all, and far beyond the sense Of man, or grasp of human evidence. Yet these are reason—throned, in nature's spite, By truth, self-poised, on revelation's height. To such, in solemn reverence, I submit, Unmoved by ridicule, my humble wit; Nor count the seed ill sown; tho' doom'd to see From the bare soil spring forth no goodly tree— Sure that at heaven's appointed day 'twill rise In full-grown strength, and spread into the skies. All lesser natures find their chiefest good In straining after better, worthier food: All strive to ascend, and all ascend in striving— Each, each subduing, and itself surviving. And shall man's strivings only—the reflection Of his most inward self—his soul's election, Be like an image in the glassy tide Of some fair tree, that, bending o'er the side, Deep and more deep, still downward seems to grow, And in the unstable element below Finds a mock heaven amid dull weeds, that spread Their living wreaths around its pictured head— Substance and shade—the real and the dream: Yet better these that are than those that seem. Is it a crime in days like these to plead The mind's exemption from all party creed? Or is it timid, wavering, insincere, By reason's glimmering lamp our course to steer— Tho' clouds of doubt by fits our path may hide, And intercept the soul's unerring guide— Strait for the haven of eternal truth; E'en though some loved companion of our youth Fall from our side, as earth-born vapours chill, And faction's withering genius warps the will? Is this a spirit of change?—or, if it be, Say, has the changeful mood pass'd over me Alone?—is it not common as the sea, And boundless?—Nay, breathes there one constant friend To freedom's cause, from Europe's furthest end, Across the wild Atlantic to the shore Where erst her brightest smiles the goddess wore, Whose ardour has no faint misgivings proved, Whose faith in man's high destinies has moved Alike progressive, since the hour when fell Gaul's proud bastille, and wild destruction's yell Was scarcely heard amid the general cry Of honest joy for rescued liberty? Or since that dawning of a brighter day, While wrapt in shade the giant future lay, That fairest hour that e'er had beam'd on earth, Resplendent light! creation's second birth! Yet then—ay, then—when France assembled sate, Prince, nobles, people, in that hall of state, When all she held, of brave, and fair, and free, Expectant hail'd the world's great jubilee,— There wanted not the seer's prophetic glance, Nor sad Cassandra's doom-denouncing trance, To dash the rapturous joy that proudly smiled Through the bright eyes of Neckar's gifted child: The wife, the matron, claim that boding tear, That stifled groan, which none beside might hear. Ill-fated Montmorin!—the tear, the groan, That mark thy country's doom, forecast thine own: Nor sex, nor age, the thirsty scaffold spares, Nor infant innocence, nor reverend hairs. Breathes there one constant friend—I ask again, Nor care who scoffs the thrice repeated strain,— One constant friend, to freedom's holy cause, To equal rights, and all-protecting laws, Who dared all conscious doubt and fear disown, When terror's form usurp'd the Bourbon throne, When nations heard the solemn dirge—“Arise, Son of Saint Louis, to thy native skies?” Or now, when Britain's alter'd land repeats Each rank delusion of Parisian cheats, In wisdom's vain pretence, religion spurns, And mocks the altar and the throne by turns? Say, is it then this Faith in things unseen, In better still to come than what has been, This loathing for the sordid and the base, For petty lucre's mean and stealthy pace, For fulsome pedantry, contention vain, And low ambition's mercenary train— Is this the cause that I so long have stood, Scorn'd and rejected, baffled, press'd, subdued? Ah no! a different page I've learn'd to read, And reason bids me own an humbler creed; Only, which way heaven points, resolved I'd go, Brave every chance, encounter every foe, Still toward perfection strain, however blind And frail mortality may lag behind; No more, in wavering balance held, from fear Of caution's censure, or derision's sneer, Stand shivering on the margin of the flood, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would;” But boldly plunge, and though the tempests roar, Bear on undoubting to the further shore. ODE ON THE DELIVERANCE OF EUROPE. 1814. The hour of blood is past; Blown the last trumpet's blast; Peal'd the last thunders of the embattled line: From hostile shore to shore The bale-fires blaze no more; But friendly beacons o'er the billows shine, To light, as to their common home, The barks of every port that cut the salt sea foam. “Peace to the nations!”—Peace! O sound of glad release To millions in forgotten bondage lying; In joyless exile thrown On shores remote, unknown, Where hope herself, if just sustain'd from dying, Yet sheds so dim and pale a light, As makes creation pall upon the sickening sight. “Peace! Peace the world around!” O strange, yet welcome sound To myriads more that ne'er beheld her face; And, if a doubtful fame Yet handed down her name In faded memory of an elder race, It seem'd some visionary form, Some Ariel, fancy-bred, to soothe the mimic storm. Now the time-honour'd few, Her earlier reign that knew, May turn their eyes back o'er that dreamy flood, And think again they stand On the remember'd land, Ere yet the sun had risen in clouds of blood, Ere launch'd the chance-directed bark On that vast world of ocean, measureless and dark. And is it all a dream? And did these things but seem— The vain delusions of a troubled sight? Or, if indeed they were, For what did nature bear The long dark horrors of that fearful night? Only to breathe and be once more Even as she was and breathed upon that former shore? O'er this wild waste of time, This sea of blood and crime, Doth godlike virtue rear her awful form, Only to cheat the sight With wandering barren light— The meteor, not the watch-fire, of the storm? The warrior's deed, the poet's strain, The statesman's anxious toil, the patriot's sufferings, vain? For this did Louis lay, In Gallia's sinful day, On the red altar his anointed head? For this did Nelson pour, In Britain's glorious hour, More precious blood than Britain e'er had shed? And did their wingéd thoughts aspire, Even in the parting soul's prophetic trance, no higher? Ye tenants of the grave, Whom unseen wisdom gave To watch the shapeless mist o'er earth extending, Yet will'd to snatch away Before the appointed day Of light renew'd, and clouds and darkness ending, Oh might ye now permitted rise, Cast o'er this wondrous scene your unobstructed eyes; And say, O thou, whose might, Bulwark of England's right, Stood forth, the might of Chatham's lordly son; Thou “on whose burning tongue Truth, peace, and freedom hung,” When freedom's ebbing sand almost had run; To the deliver'd world declare, That each hath seen fulfill'd his latest, earliest prayer. Rejoice, kings of the earth! But with a temperate mirth; The trophies ye have won, the wreaths ye wear— Power with his red right hand, And empire's despot brand, Had ne'er achieved these proud rewards ye bear; But, in one general cause combined, The people's vigorous arm, the monarch's constant mind. Yet that untired by toil, Unsway'd by lust of spoil, Unmoved by fear, or soft desire of rest, Ye kept your onward course With unremitted force, And to the distant goal united press'd; The soldier's bed, the soldier's fare, His dangers, wants, and toils, alike resolved to share. And more—that when, at length, Exulting in your strength, In tyranny o'erthrown, and victory won, Before you lowly laid, Your dancing eyes survey'd The prostrate form of humbled Babylon, Ye cried, “Enough!”—and at the word Vengeance put out her torch, and slaughter sheathed his sword— Princes, be this your praise! And ne'er in after days Let faction rude that spotless praise profane, Or dare with license bold The impious falsehood hold, That Europe's genuine kings have ceased to reign, And that a weak adulterate race, Degenerate from their sires, pollutes high honour's place. Breathe, breathe again, ye free, The air of liberty, The native air of wisdom, virtue, joy! And, might ye know to keep The golden wealth ye reap, Not thrice ten years of terror and annoy, Of mad destructive anarchy, And pitiless oppression, were a price too high. Vaulting ambition! mourn Thy bloody laurels torn, And ravish'd from thy grasp the sin-bought prize; Or, if thy meteor fame Still win the world's acclaim, Let it behold thee now with alter'd eyes, And pass, but with a pitying smile, The hope-abandon'd chief of Elba's lonely isle. FOR THE GENERAL FAST. 1832. The wrath of God—the wrath of God— Is pour'd upon a guilty land: Who can resist His awful rod? His gather'd vengeance who withstand? What may this vast corruption be, That makes our God His face to hide— That flows as hugely as the sea, And swallows all it reaches?—Pride. The pride of reason and of power, The pride of knowledge and of skill, The pride of fashion's painted flower, And of ungovernable will. Pride—that deforms our beauteous vales With riot fierce and gloomy rage— That makes o'erflow our groaning gaols With desperate youth and harden'd age. Pride—that the towering statesman steels To point the unhesitating wound, And reckless what his victim feels, To dart sarcastic lightnings round. Pride—that perverts the sacred theme By glosses drawn from man's decrees— That makes an atom judge supreme Of heaven's unfathom'd mysteries; That bids the pamper'd heir of wealth From misery's plaint regardless turn; The confident in youth and health Grey hairs and pale diseases spurn; Self-honour'd virtue shut the door On penitence for errors past; Self-worshipp'd wit disdain the lore That sage antiquity held fast; Half-letter'd pedantry assume The lofty magisterial speech; And to its own base level doom The heights it ne'er was given to reach; All sects, all classes, all degrees Of men that move beneath the sun, One universal madness seize Of struggling not to be out-done. Hence mutual jealousies and fears; Deadly revenges; devilish hates; And hours perform the work of years In urging on the fall of states. —Haste, Britain, to the mercy-seat, And gird thy robe of sackcloth on; And thus in solemn strain repeat, Devoutly prostrate at the throne— “The wrath of God—the wrath of God— Is pour'd upon a guilty land: None can resist His awful rod; His gather'd vengeance none withstand. “Yet, Lord, our humble offering take, And turn no more thy face aside, Whilst at thy altar we forsake Our rebel wit—our idol Pride. “The festering plagues that round us wait Are but the type of that within. O God! of thy great power abate The moral pestilence of sin! “So may our land thy holy name Again with hymns of triumph sing; Again with ceaseless shout proclaim— The Lord of Hosts is Britain's king!” SONNETS. 1834–5. SONNET I. Yon party zealot, ignorant as warm, Has taunted me with change—a charge untrue. I ne'er was one with that deceitful crew, Who mean Destruction when they roar “Reform;” My purpose ever to prevent the storm 'Tis theirs to excite. The wholesome air I drew With my first breath was Loyalty. I grew In childhood reverence of her sacred form: And, as she beam'd upon my youthful eye, Link'd with her mountain sister Liberty, In holiest union, all the more she won My love and worship; and so made me shun The fellowship of those who madly try To rend asunder what heaven join'd in one. SONNET II. “The king's name is a tower of strength”—e'en so May it be ever in this favour'd land— Of strength alike for succour and command, Shelter from storms, and safety from the foe; For refuge to the needy and the low, When leagued oppressors their just rights withstand; The nation's sure defence, whene'er the hand Of bigot faction seeks its overthrow. Then honour'd be that name by all who share The blessings it protects; nor honour'd less The patriot chieftain's, who, when dangers press, Alike regardless, or of ambush'd snare, Or fierce assault, with soldier steadfastness Is ever at his post—to do and dare. SONNET III. “Awake! arise! or be for ever fallen.” —MILTON. ?, awake!—or sleep thy long, last sleep— ?, arise!—or be for ever lost Among the fallen—What? know'st thou not the cost Of real glory?—canst thou look to reap The great reward, by following those that creep Along shore, when thy country's hopes are tost On the wide main—by warring tempests crost, And well nigh founder'd in the yawning deep? ?, awake! It is thy country's voice That bids thee rouse—that calls thee to her side. Thy name, so oft in glorious conflict tried, When victory hath bid her sons rejoice, We now invoke, to stem destruction's tide. Awake! arise! the patriot hath no choice. SONNET IV. “Upon the king!” —SHAKSP. HENRY V. ?, awake!—The warning voice again— Again, again it sounds—awake! arise! Purge off the noxious film that clouds thine eyes, Engender'd erst in faction's secret den. There is no party now for honest men— None but their country's. Here the good and wise Have fix'd the sacred standard, that defies Mere human force, and will be shaken then Only, when God ordains. Upon a rock It stands secure. An oak's wide branches fling Their shadows round its base. About it flock The nations, and there rest the wearied wing, Unscathed by scorching hate, or envy's shock— That rock our country, and that oak our king. A CHRONICLE OF THE KINGS OF ENGLAND, FROM THE INVASION OF JULIUS CÆSAR TO THE REVOLUTION OF 1688. PROLOGUE. My worthy little Joe, come listen to my song! I hope you will not think it dull, albeit something long. I began it for your brothers, some twenty years ago, And now I'll finish it for you, my worthy little Joe. This famous land of Britain, 'tis since two thousand years, Was parcell'd out to various tribes, as plainly it appears By Cæsar's martial pen; though, how it so befell, Whatever we may guess, is more than you or I can tell. For, since the use of letters was to those tribes unknown, And men ne'er chronicled their acts on parchment or on stone, So all we've since been told of Brute, that Trojan bold, Of Gorboduc, or Albanact, or Lud or Bladud old, Of good King Coil, or Lear, with his royal daughters three, Are tales invented but to please a nation's vanity. Yet of their ancient Druids from Rome we something know, Of rites perform'd in oaken groves, and the sacred misletoe; And wonderful Stonehenge, on Sarum's lonely height, Yet stands, to show how well they built, although they could not write. INVASION OF JULIUS CÆSAR. BEF. CHR. 55. Ere man's redemption dawn'd, some fifty years or more, His conquering legions Julius led from Gaul's opposing shore; Twice visited our isle; the Thames at Coway cross'd, Encamp'd in London, and advanced to Verulam his host. Cassibelan was chief among the Britons then, Whose son was Cymbeline, renown'd by Shakspere's famous pen; Him follow'd Caradoc, a name to freedom dear, Who with the Roman eagle strove through many a tedious year, But, led at length in chains, to swell the victor's state, Display'd the unconquerable will, triumphant over fate. Nor till a century pass'd since Cæsar had survey'd Our sea-girt coast, and Rome had yet no lasting conquest made, Agricola first traversed the land from side to side, Beat Galgacus, and built a chain of forts 'twixt Forth and Clyde. SECOND CENTURY. Another age glides o'er, unmark'd in history's line, Save by the walls which Hadrian raised, and peaceful Antonine, To curb the lawless Scots in their ungenial home, And guard from painted Highlanders the provinces of Rome. To humbled Britain then it little difference made If rightful loins the purple wore, or usurpation sway'd; And profitless the tale how bold Albinus held Cæsarean power, to be at length by stern Severus quell'd. THIRD CENTURY. Four years in Britain's isle the conqueror remain'd, Completed Hadrian's bulwark mound, and many victories gain'd; Made famous York his seat; then closed his aged eyes: Whose monster son with brother's blood achieved the imperial prize. Nigh fourscore winters more, with slow and silent pace, Crept on, and of their peaceful lapse scarce left a dubious trace; Then Caros, “king of ships,” unfurl'd his “wings of pride,” And dared with Rome's acknowledged lords the sceptre to divide. Seven years the shores of Britain confess'd his sovereign sway; Then, beat at Boulogne, he at York by traitors murder'd lay. Constantius well avenged his fate, and soon was made Joint emperor, and Italy with Gaul and Britain sway'd— A true and valiant prince, who, summon'd to resign By death, his peaceful sceptre left to chosen Constantine. FOURTH CENTURY. When Constantine was dead, and Rome had ceased to be Sole mistress of the subject world, and seat of empery, The lawless Scots and Picts, who long had kept, controll'd, Within their Caledonian woods, now, rushing from their hold, Burst thro' the Roman mounds, and, fiercely rolling down, Laid waste fair Britain's peopled fields, and humbled tower and town. These Constans first repell'd; then Theodosius, sent By Valentinian, backward drove, and in their forests pent; Restored Severus' wall, and the towers of Antonine, And all the land Valentia named, between the Forth and Tyne: A brief, though generous gleam of Rome's expiring power— For now with silent pace glides on the inevitable hour; And ere the century's close, from Roman bondage free, Deserted Britain trembling found her long sought liberty. FIFTH CENTURY. That day was all o'erspread with gloom of blackest night, Which saw the Roman eagle stoop, to take his parting flight. No pœans then were heard, nor hymns of liberty, But lamentations loud and long, and many a boding cry. Yet freedom, which with force resistless arms the brave, Has power to raise the coward soul, and renovate the slave; And forty years of doubtful and bloody strife attest That servitude has not destroy'd the virtues it repress'd. At length, in evil hour, the British prince dismay'd, To quell his Scottish foes, besought the Saxon pirates' aid. Bold Hengist seized the moment, by fate propitious lent, Claim'd for his fee dominion, and became First King of Kent. Him other chieftains follow'd, with like desire possess'd, And Ælla ruled it in the south, and Cerdic in the west. Still, as the danger thicken'd, the more to meet it rose The spirit which, in noble minds, with opposition grows: Then lived renownéd Arthur, who, as old stories tell, Was begotten of a dragon, with aid of Merlin's spell. But of him, or his queen Guiniver, or the “fifty good and able Knights, that resorted unto him, and were of his round table,” I need no more relate, nor of “Lancelot du lake, Nor Tristram de Léonnois, who fought for ladies' sake,” Nor of the famous battle o'er traitor Mordred won, Nor how the hero sleeping lies in the isle of Avalon; Dreams once received as true in lordly hall and bower; The solace since of age and youth in many a vacant hour; But now no longer prized, while all they seem to show Is, that there lived in Britain, thirteen hundred years ago, A valiant native prince, who his country's cause upheld, And Cerdic, with his ravagers, at Badon's mount repell'd. SIXTH CENTURY. As wave on wave will wear the hardest rock away, Outnumber'd thus by host on host, the British powers decay: Jutes, Angles, Saxons, all the sons of Odin, swarm Around the rich unguarded hive, with thirst of plunder warm. The south already settled, the east they next o'errun, And Erkenwin rules Essex ere the century's begun; Then Ida to the north directs his chosen band, At Bamborough builds his royal seat, and rules Northumberland. These Saxon both—two more were from the Angles named— The east was Offa's—in the west was Crida king proclaim'd: The boundaries of whose realm, extending more and more, Encircled soon the land from Trent to Severn's winding shore, By the Welsh marches border'd, thence Mercia call'd by name: Thus, ere the century closed, complete the Heptarchy became. And, since of all the tribes that Odin's standard rear'd, The Angles first in number, as in warlike strength, appear'd, The land—as inch by inch, its native tribes gave way, Assumed the English name and style, and bears them to this day. Nor long the conquering hordes their father's creed retain'd; Kent first embraced the christian faith, where empire first they gain'd; To Ethelbert, its king, the convert's praise is due, And holy Austin sow'd the seed that soon to fulness grew. SEVENTH CENTURY. Another age succeeds, unmark'd in rolls of fame; But wider yet, and yet more wide, extends the English name: Wales, Cornwall, Cumberland, the Britons still possess'd; The monarchs of the Heptarchy divided all the rest. At Bampton Cynegils a mighty victory gains, And thus confirms his sovereignty o'er beauteous Devon's plains; While Ethelfrid, near Chester, the prince of Powis quells, Tho' Bangor's holy monks assist with candles and with bells. Cadwallon still retains the hope which never fails In noble minds, of better days, and more auspicious gales; In league with furious Penda, the Mercian king, allied, Invades Northumberland, and thrice with royal blood is dyed; At length by Oswald slain; whom Penda shortly paid At Oswestry; himself to fall by Oswy's vengeful blade. Near Leeds the blow was struck which set the nations free From tyrant yoke, and saved our church from heathen cruelty. EIGHTH CENTURY. By christian light illumined, now brighter days succeed; And learning still adores the name of venerable Bede. The lust of power gives way to mild religion's call, And monarchs for the cowl exchange the sceptre and the ball— Exchange of death for life, short pomp for endless bliss— Which, if we superstition term, we judge our sires amiss. Then were rich abbeys founded, where arts and letters reign'd, And warriors fierce—their swords laid by—more glorious triumphs gain'd. Then peaceful Ina ruled with wisdom's just applause, And to his realm of Wessex gave, the volume of her laws; Alike on church and state his benefactions pour'd, At once as patriot chief beloved, as royal saint adored. Offa, for bolder deeds renown'd, maintain'd his sway O'er Mercian fields, and made the kings of lesser states obey: By battle some he quell'd, and some to death betray'd; Saint Alban's founded, and a dyke from Dee to Severn made: Then went to Rome, in penance for blood of kindred spilt, And sought by tributary pence atonement for his guilt. NINTH CENTURY. With the ninth century's dawn another face is seen Of England, parted long so many rival states between: Three crowns alone, of all the Heptarchy, remain For fierce ambition to dispute, or fortune to attain. In two, intestine faction distracts the bleeding land; In Mercia first, since Offa's death—and, next, Northumberland. This Egbert, by descent from Cerdic rightful heir Of Wessex, whence he long had learn'd the exile's lot to bear, Now home returning found, and having fix'd secure His native throne—through many an age still destined to endure— The Mercian first o'erwhelm'd on Wilton's bloody day, Northumbria next in peace received beneath his kingly sway. THE HEPTARCHY UNITED. And now I've brought my tale to royal Egbert down, And happy England owns henceforth an undivided crown; I too will seek to curb the licence of my strain, And chronicle in order due the acts of every reign. Egbert, in Twenty-seven, the Heptarchy unites, And Cornishmen with Danes combined defeats on Hengsdown heights. Next, Ethelwolf, his son, in Thirty-six succeeds, Who with the Danes at Okeley fights, in Surry's pleasant meads, And frees the invaded isle: then superstitious grown, Grants of his lands a tenth to Rome, and leaves a crippled throne. In Fifty-seven he yields to Ethelbald the west, To Ethelbert the eastern parts, who soon the whole possess'd. Their brother Ethelred in Sixty-six is crown'd, Who from the Danes at Basingstoke receives his mortal wound, And leaves the land a prey to pirates fierce, agreed With fickle Mercians and the tribes from Humber unto Tweed. Alfred—surnamed the Great—the fourth and youngest son Of Ethelwolf—survives the rest, and reigns in Seventy-one; In many a hard-fought field defeats the bloody Danes, Sets free the land, rebuilds its towns, and slighted law maintains: Yet not at once he rose to glory's dizzy height, From whence so many soar to fall to lower depths of night. With painful steps ascending,—beset by doubt and dread— Now wandering o'er the pathless down, now housed in peasant shed, A name at length he gains, the Saviour of the land, Fairer than conquest e'er bestow'd, or fortune can command. TENTH CENTURY. In valour next his sire—this century begins With Edward, who from Ethelwald the crown contested wins; By aid of Ethelflede, his martial sister, shields From Britons and Northumbrian Danes fair Mercia's threaten'd fields, And dies in Twenty-five. His son, tho' basely born, Wise Athelstan, defends the crown he ought not to have worn, The Britons, Danes, and Scots, at Brunanburgh confounds, And restless Cornishmen confines within the Tamar's bounds. Edmund, the rightful heir, in Forty-one succeeds, Who conquers British Cumberland, and by a robber bleeds. Edred, in Forty-six, assumes the vacant helm— But bold Saint Dunstan now appears, and rules both king and realm; From youthful Edwy tears his consort and his throne, And bids his brother Edgar seize the conquest not his own. Edgar—the tool of priests—but amorous, brave, and free, First fixes England's empery, majestic on the sea; For justice well maintain'd, and peaceful arts renown'd, The court with regal pomp he kept, the land with plenty crown'd. Edward, the martyr named, his false step-mother kills In Seventy-nine; and Ethelred the seat of empire fills; The second Ethelred, in whose long, feeble reign, The realm is ravaged by the Danes, and yields to conquering Sweyn. ELEVENTH CENTURY. The sceptre next descends on Edmund Ironside; A valiant prince; but forced ere long his kingdom to divide, From Severn unto Thames, with Great Canute the Dane, And afterwards at Oxford by the traitor Edric slain. Canute, at Edmund's death, the sever'd realm unites In Seventeen, and rules in peace, and guards the nation's rights. England and Denmark both confess his sovereign sway, And Norway bends beneath his yoke, and Scotia's isles obey. Harold in Thirty-six succeeds; in thirty-nine Queen Emma's son, fierce Hardicnute, the last of Danish line. Edward the Confessor, King Edmund's youngest son, Restores the ancient Saxon race, and reigns in Forty-one; But, long in foreign lands a wandering exile known, Calls in his Norman friends to share the honours of his throne. Earl Godwin and his sons the English rights support, Expel the foreigners, and rule in Edward's feeble court. THE NORMAN CONQUEST. Harold, Earl Godwin's son, is next acknowledged king, And wears the crown that should have fall'n on Edgar Atheling. In sixty-six he reigns, but, ere a twelvemonth's o'er, Yields up his empire and his life on Hastings' bloody shore To Norman William, who supports his doubtful claim, Founded on Edward's royal will, by conquest's prouder name; Then, of the crown possess'd, his subject realm maintains By laws severe, and force of arms, and curbs with iron chains. Parcell'd in Doomsday book, the forfeit lands are given Among his Norman followers. He dies in Eighty-seven. Robert, the Conqueror's eldest son, and heir by right, Against his sire in Normandy then waged unnatural fight; This lost him England's crown, which Rufus makes his own, And reigns at Westminster secure upon a wrongful throne. But Heaven not long permits his tyrant sway to last; In the New Forest hunting slain, ere thirteen years are pass'd. TWELFTH CENTURY. Another century dawns, while hapless Robert bore The sacred standard of the cross on Judah's hallow'd shore; Returning home to claim once more the regal prize, Finds Henry crown'd—against him strives—and in a dungeon dies. First Henry, Beauclerk named, the Conqueror's youngest son— His usurpation's guilt forgot, deserved the crown he won: Learn'd, fortunate, and wise, he reign'd with just applause, And granted the first charter of our liberties and laws; Unhappy tow'rds the close, his only son he lost, Wreck'd, with his sister and his friends, upon the Norman coast. Stephen, in Thirty-five, usurps the English crown, But for that wrong and fraudful act, a prince of fair renown; With Maud, King Henry's daughter, for eighteen years and more, Maintains a fierce and doubtful fight, and dies in Fifty-four. Henry, Fitz-empress styled, the first Plantagenet, Assumes as rightful heir the crown his progeny holds yet; Extends his royal sway o'er Anjou, Touraine, Maine, And, wedding Eleanor, unites the realm of Aquitaine; Ireland and Wales subdues, and humbles Scotia's pride, But quarrels with the Church, and is by his own sons defied; At Canterbury bows to murder'd Becket's shrine, And, broken hearted, yields to fate, and dies in Eighty-nine. Richard, the Lion's heart, disdains a peaceful throne; He routs the Saracens before the walls of Ascalon; A barren laurel wreath from Saladin obtains, While England, to maintain his pride, her dearest life blood drains; Then, homeward bound, is captived by an unworthy foe, And afterwards, in war with France, is slain by a cross-bow. THIRTEENTH CENTURY. John reigns in Ninety-nine, Plantagenet's youngest son, Who kills his nephew Arthur, rightful heir to England's throne; From Normandy expell'd, and urged by wars at home, Basely surrenders up his lands in vassalage to Rome; Then by his barons humbled, and forced with France to fight, He Magna Charta signs, the lasting bulwark of our right. Henry the Third succeeds his father in Sixteen, And proves himself in action weak, irresolute, and mean. His sire's extorted charter he threatens to revoke; Then by his barons forced, confirms, and bends him to the yoke; But soon by broken faith his perjured soul sets free, While they, by potent Montfort led, proclaim their liberty. Thence bloody wars ensue. At Lewes prisoner made, The vanquish'd king his rescue owes to Edward's filial aid: Montfort at Evesham pays to death the tribute due, And Henry his inglorious reign concludes in Seventy-two. Edward—the Fourth since Alfred—First since William reign'd— Was stout of stature, and in arms a knightly fame obtain'd; Against the barons leagued maintain'd his father's crown, And, after, won in Palestine the meed of high renown: There mourn'd his father's death, and thence returning king, To stern ambition left a name of doutful blazoning. Scotland and Wales attest his perjury and pride; France, Spain, and Germany, his sense, high prized, and often tried. England in him revered her lawgiver and sage, Her second Alfred, sent to stamp his impress on the age. FOURTEENTH CENTURY. To Edward, his first-born, 'mid scenes of blood and tears, (First prince of conquer'd Wales,) he left, in Thirteen-seven, his cares. Twice ten unhappy years, he of Caernarvon held The sceptre, like a trembling reed, by every gust impell'd; Enslaved to base delights, by baser minions led, Wallowing in glutton's filthy sty, and stew'd in sluggard's bed. 'Gainst him his barons bold their blushing banners bore, And with them “the she-wolf of France” her husband's entrails tore. As when awhile the sun curtain'd with cloudy red Reposes on the orient wave—then, rushing from his bed, Flames forth on all around, the glorious lord of day, So the third Edward, rising, chased rebellion's fumes away; His wolf-like mother tamed in penitential bower, And to a sterner fate consign'd her bloody paramour; Then urged his claim, by birth, to Gaul's disputed throne, Repelling Valois' boastful taunts with freedom's loftiest tone. Victor o'er half the world array'd on Cressy's field, He made them to his English bow the foremost honours yield: France yet beheld the sire exceeded by the son, Who on famed Poictiers' day renew'd the wreath at Cressy won. Then brightest shone the star, we never more shall see Except in memory's faithful glass, of ancient chivalry; By whose reflected light, whoe'er would justly view The deeds of those romantic days must history's line pursue— Not weigh the amount of blood and crime in scales precise, But ask how dear was glory deem'd ere they condemn the price. Yet soon or late high heaven will vindicate its sway, Abase the crest of full-blown pomp, and make the proud obey. Thus England learn'd to mourn her sable warrior dead, While dotage laid her palsied hand on Edward's laurell'd head. The sun in clouds is set; but bright the morning smiles That hails his grandson Richard lord of Britain's favour'd isles. “Fair laughs” that rosy morn, and “soft the zephyrs play,” While, gliding o'er the glassy waves, the bark pursues its way: The gaily painted bark bounds o'er the liquid realm, While fond youth frolics at the prow, and pleasure guides the helm; Fit emblem, poor Bordeaux, of thine inconstant soul, That tempted still the fate it own'd no virtue to control. FIFTEENTH CENTURY. Since Bethlehem's star had risen, the Fourteen Hundredth year Breaks on the treason-purchased reign of banish'd Lancaster. With blind ambition leagued, dark vengeance aim'd the stroke, Which laid the rightful monarch low, and lifted Bolingbroke. Well has the faithful muse that chronicled his guilt, And paints him reeking from the blood of foes at Shrewsbury spilt, Display'd how fell remorse, with her relentless tooth, More sharp than rebel swords, destroy'd the promise of his youth. His thorn-encircled crown scarce thirteen years he wore; Yet be that short and feverish space renown'd on Albion's shore— Dawn of a purer faith, by persecution fann'd To a bright flame, that silently possess'd the wondering land— First kindled in the cot; thence spreading, sure of proof, To peopled towns, and castled hall, and proud cathedral roof. The lines inclosed between brackets are by another hand.[Harry, of Monmouth named, from lawless youth and wild, Steps forth—in war a chief renown'd, in peace a monarch mild; Asserts o'er Gallia's crown his unforgotten claim, And calls his warlike subjects out to battle for the same; With men at arms and archers, a small but gallant host, Lays siege to Harfleur's famous wall, hard by the Norman coast; Thence carving thro' the fields of Picardy his way, Confronts the French at Agincourt upon St. Crispian's day. 'Gainst sixty thousand men with thousands ten he fights, And strews the field with Gallia's best—her nobles and her knights; Received in Paris' gates, by factious traitors' aid, By wedding tie confirms anew the conquests he has made, Then hastes to arms afresh, the dauphin to subdue, But leaves to fate his half-won realm, and dies in Twenty-two.] Sixth Harry, by the name of royal Windsor known, Plantagenet and Valois mix'd, is cradled on the throne; His baby brows the badge of double empire wear, His childish hands the sceptre grasp they have not strength to bear. By jarring uncles wrong'd, by shaven priesthood led, And govern'd in his riper years by her who shared his bed. First, Bedford lost him France, by maiden's arm subdued; Next, Beaufort's ghostly pride the flames of civil broil renew'd; By whom, with Suffolk leagued, (Queen Margaret's minion slave,) The good Protector Humphry found in Alban's shrine a grave. Thence bloody times come on; the din of battle bray'd, To pointed lance was lance opposed, to war-horse war-horse neigh'd. Thro' kindred ranks fell slaughter pursued her hellish work; The red rose bloom'd for Lancaster, its pallid foe for York. [In Fourteen-fifty-five that desperate strife began, And thrice five years the afflicted land with blood incessant ran. Then sack'd was many a castle, and rifled many a shrine, And sword and spear and headsman's axe thinn'd many an ancient line.] All England then put on the crimson or the white; The anointed monarch some maintain'd, and some the king by right: At length the right prevail'd; and Towton's well-fought field Beheld, in Sixty-one, his crown “the meek usurper” yield. By Warwick's power upheld, Fourth Edward grasps the prize, Which, when the earl his aid withdraws, he, hunted, quits, and flies; But when, on Barnet field, by all-subduing death The mighty king-maker, compell'd, has paid his forfeit breath, O'er England's war-worn soil he re-assumes his sway, And Lancaster his mortal blow receives on Tewkesbury's day. There fell, untimely cropt, its young and hopeful flower; The parent stem to wither left in London's storied tower— This fell'd by brutal rage, and that (if fame speaks true,) Doom'd with his sacred blood the hands of murder foul t'embrue. But sober history doubts the tale of useless guilt; Enough of crime without it wrought, enough of life-blood spilt. England in Henry mourn'd the saint, as king, she spurn'd, While Edward, passion's lawless slave, unwept to dust return'd. He died in Eighty-three; and, ere a year had flown, His brother Gloster sate, acknowledged king, on Albion's throne— His nephews first removed, and, as old histories say, By bloody ruffians smother'd, while embraced in sleep they lay; But, true or false the fame by crafty Richmond spread, It gain'd a crown on Bosworth field, and lost a monarch's head. Henry the Seventh, sole heir of Lancaster confest, Now weds with York, and twines each rose on Tudor's British crest; In Eighty-five begins to reign; and lives to see The dawn of Europe's brightest age, the Sixteenth century— Resplendent age, for acts and arms alike renown'd, For sacred wisdom's purer light, and learning more profound. His empire he cemented with blood of nobles, spilt In thirty years of slaughter wild, by others' woes and guilt; With prudent laws repress'd the pride of high estate, And raised the monarchy above the envy of the great; But own'd a narrow soul, and, dead to future fame, With avarice and extortion stain'd the brightness of his name. When Fifteen Hundred years, with three times three, had run, He dying left a quiet throne to his more famous son. SIXTEENTH CENTURY. High swoln with pride of birth and undisputed sway, Eighth Harry yet aspired to bear the schoolman's palm away; Rome's self-elected champion, bold Luther he reviled, And by her grateful pontiff was “The Faith's Defender” styled; But, thwarted in the hope of freedom from his vows To Katharine of Aragon, his first and lawful spouse, Turn'd rebel to his church, the papal power defied, Pull'd Wolsey down, divorced his queen, and crown'd his chosen bride. Yet 'twas no “gospel light that beam'd from Anna's eyes,” Nor blind self-will, nor stubborn pride, e'er made a monarch wise, And England's church, at length from Rome's corruptions freed, Might blush to own so foul a source for her regenerate creed. Then ancient abbeys mourn'd their rifled cloisters void, Their lands to new possessors pass'd, and holiest shrines destroy'd. Rapacious courtiers shared whate'er the monarch's hand In mad profusion scatter'd o'er the desecrated land. Then stream'd the headsman's axe with blood of richest dye; More, Fisher, Cromwell, fell to glut a jealous tyrant's eye: Two queens beneath it bled; by guilt or slander stain'd; Two queens divorced; one died; and one, though doom'd to die, remain'd. These gallant Surrey follow'd: at last, in Forty-seven, The pamper'd king was call'd to meet the just award of heaven. Jane Seymour's only son—the tyrant's best loved queen— Edward, at ten years old, succeeds, and dies ere yet sixteen. Age ripe enough the germ of inward worth to scan, And from the promise of the boy, predict the future man. For learning's envied prize was to his youth assign'd, And early discipline improved the virtues of his mind. Then great Protector Somerset, with Cranmer's aid, The church new modell'd, and complete the Reformation made; Tho' Gardiner, with savage Bonner link'd, oppose, While, for their ancient faith array'd, the murmuring Commons rose. Great Somerset pull'd down, and pious Edward dead, Mary, as Henry's eldest born, was rightful queen instead; But for her faith profess'd in Romish tenets known, Found fierce rebellion arm'd to guard the passage to the throne. With Dudley Grey combined, their sordid end to gain, Set up a claimant to the crown in poor devoted Jane; Proclaim'd, abandon'd, left to pay the traitor's due, The fairest, gentlest victim stern ambition ever slew. Now mass again was said thro' all the darken'd isle; The holy rood again was seen in every sainted pile; And sacring bells were rung, and holy water shed, And consecrated tapers hung around the dying bed. Too blest, had superstition no worse designs embraced, When Pole for toleration sued, and Heaven his pleading graced. But bigotry prevail'd, and persecution fann'd The flames of glorious martyrdom that sanctified the land. Then Hooper, Ridley, Latimer, the compact seal'd, And Cranmer burn'd the recreant hand that once was known to yield. In pitiless resolve, the gloomy queen survey'd, With Philip, her yet darker spouse, the waste her edicts made; Beheld how fruitless all—then, sullenly, to fate Resign'd her fond, deluded soul. She died in Fifty-eight. Elizabeth—the third, and last surviving flower Of Henry's royal stem, now quits, compell'd, her maiden bower; Fair Boleyn's only child, the new religion's pride, Learnéd and wise beyond her years; by early perils tried. Old superstition shrank confounded from the view And Reformation, warier grown, commenced its work anew. Yet joyless is the feast that love has never crown'd, And heaven rejects the sacrifice where not the heart is found. Another age, and yet another, must succeed, Ere charity be understood, or wiser England freed From persecution's stain, which dimm'd her face no less In confiscation's garb, or mere exclusion's milder dress, Than when her fiery robe in Smithfield she put on, And stupid ignorance half excused the deeds in darkness done. The more it was repress'd, the more opinion grew; Geneva sounded through the land, and Knox the trumpet blew. That fierce and stirring blast uprooted Scotland's throne; The sister queen—the beauty—pleads in misery's humbled tone. O blot of Tudor's line! O England's lasting shame! Again the ruthless steel descends on woman's sacred frame— That frame, an outraged queen's—the third since Boleyn bled, Who on the thirsty block laid down her unresisting head. Yet not for this the mighty debt we owe to thee, And thy great name, Elizabeth! can ever cancell'd be. No—Britain first may sink beneath her subject main, Ere she forget the dauntless arm that quell'd the pride of Spain, O'er native freedom threw a broad protecting shield, And England's rising energies to her own sons reveal'd. Then was her golden age in arts and learned lore, When free-born genius burst away, to heights unknown before, And never equall'd since. Then Shakspeare's deathless lays Were heard, and Spenser pour'd the song in Gloriana's praise. SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. Another century breaks; and Tudor's royal line Has seen its last and brightest star 'mid vapourish mists decline; [When James, the Sixth of Scots, of England's crown the First, In ancient pride and penury bred, in letter'd dulness nursed, Call'd by the voice of state to seize the vacant helm, Full gladly quits for southern fields his black and lawless realm. Of dubious will, and weak; no pilot fit to guide When winds and furious waves assault the vessel's labouring side; Yet kindly and sincere, his soul rejoiced to see The rich freight ride in safe repose upon the quiet sea. Thus, while he reign'd, the land was blest with lasting peace, And heaven gave forth its favouring dews and earth her large increase. And learning, call'd from cell and college forth to day, Blazed round the throne, tho' flattery's mists obscured the heavenly ray. Thrice happy, had he sought thro' her alone to shine, Nor fix'd on law his pedant grasp, nor dream'd of power divine! The young oak tho' ye bind with brazen clasp and chain, The sap will rise, the bark will swell, and rend the links in twain: So England, roused at last her lingering strength to prove, Shall moisten with the son's heart-blood the web the father wove. With many a presage dark of public doubt and fear, The Century opes with Charles's reign its Six-and-twentieth year. Led by his Gallic spouse, he tries in evil hour Ambition's steep and dark ascent to reach forbidden power: He screens from public hate his favourite's threaten'd life, Who 'scapes vindictive law's pursuit to meet the assassin's knife. He braves the Commons' right, betrays the nation's weal, Sustain'd by Strafford's gloomy pride, and Laud's unholy zeal. In vain would law resume her violated sway, While sovereigns scorn to hold their trust, and subjects to obey. The fatal hour of strife has dawn'd upon the earth; New times, new thoughts, and monstrous deeds, are struggling into birth; The patriot arms for right, the courtier for the crown, But sharpest bites the zealot's steel, who deems God's cause his own. Opposed in many a fight, the kindred squadrons stood; Each mansion was a fortalice, each river ran with blood— That blood which flow'd apace on Keynton's fatal down, At Marston, and on Naseby Heath, and twice by Newbury town. Ill was their glory won, who led each adverse line, Stout Fairfax, Waller, and Montrose, and Rupert of the Rhine. Oh! be each 'scutcheon rased; forgot each soldier name, Which gains in fields of civil strife a dark unenvied fame! The people's cause prevails; but, ere the sword they sheathe, The victors join their blood-stain'd hands, and doom their king to death. A dark and desperate deed—a precedent of crime— A blot on freedom's blazon'd scroll to all succeeding time.] The Thirtieth January was the recorded day, And Sixteen-forty-eight the year, as old-style annals say— As time is now computed, Sixteen-hundred-forty-nine— When royal Charles was martyr'd in the cause of right divine— Religion the pretence—in truth, the exploded creed Of many made for one, and kings by God from duty freed. Yet not those daring men, who cast so far away All reverence, faith, and loyal love that mark'd an elder day, Could well their cause approve, when to their shame they saw The soldier-saint profanely step into the seat of law; When by his single stamp their sanhedrim disperst, With all its dream'd omnipotence, the empty bubble burst. [A few short months endured the new republic's state, 'Mid treason foul, and threatening arms, and impotent debate. He mounts him to the throne, with recent slaughter wet, And tramples on the pride of Tudor and Plantagenet. In Windsor's halls the shades of kings look grimly down On him whose sceptre is his sword, his cap of steel the crown. Avoid that gleaming helm, ye vanquish'd, from afar! For on its crest the furies sit of Worcester and Dunbar. Avoid that falchion bathed in Ireland's richest gore, Which parcell'd out to stranger bands her wide unpeopled shore! By many a bloody step he won his upward way, But held with wisdom and renown his self-supported sway; Then Holland stoop'd to share the empire of the main, Then quail'd beneath resistless Blake the chivalry of Spain; And Cromwell's voice proclaim'd his England's future doom To soar in pride and strength beyond the eagle flight of Rome. Fate gave one transient glance to his prophetic sense, Then call'd, in darkness and in storms, the mighty spirit hence. With bonfires and with healths, with joyous peal and din, The Second Charles' inglorious reign is fondly usher'd in. Now change we cap and band, and cloak of solemn gray, For lace, and scarf, and flowing locks, and foreign pageants gay. The merry monarch's self leads down the festive dance, With ribald wits, and graceless lords, and pleasant dames of France; While seers proclaim the signs of judgment on the land, And London weeps, in sackcloth dight, beneath the Almighty hand. She feels, in Sixty-five, fierce plague's commission'd ire, Sees tower and town, in Sixty-six, sink down 'mid smouldering fire; Within the arms of Thames our fleet the Dutchman braves; The Bourbon deals his treacherous gold, and rules a court of slaves. The people's wrath aroused, yet reckless of its aim, Wreaks fancied crimes on guiltless heads, while justice bears the blame. Again the scaffolds rise, the generous victims bleed, And Russell for his country dies, and Stafford for his creed: Foe to his people's cause—apostate from their faith, The king expires, despised in age, deserted at his death.] The Second James succeeds, as York already known; The zealot of a slavish faith, and a despotic throne; Not like his age corrupt—perhaps in soul sincere— But blind in judgment, stiff in act, and gloomily severe. No Nero—yet could see, with cold and tearless eye, A brother's young and cherish'd hope upon the scaffold die— No Valois—yet could goad the servile law's delay, And revel in the blood that flow'd beneath her ermined sway. But not on him be laid, nor on his head, the blame Of freedom scourged, and justice spurn'd; let England own her shame. By her, and by her sons, in ages yet unborn, Like amulet of saving power, be this remembrance worn. She forged herself the chain—she drugg'd herself the bowl; Kind Heaven the Great Deliverer sent; and light on darkness stole. [Hail, single hero of a mean corrupted age, Illustrious William, dear alike to soldier and to sage! What tho', in after times, thy glorious name be lent To gild the cause of party strife, and factious discontent; What tho', whilst yet on earth thy star auspicious beam'd, Black clouds of envy paled its light, and thwarting meteors gleam'd: Tho' all thy steps were dogg'd by traitors doubly sold, Tho' titled patriots play'd the game of state with foreign gold, Tho' laws were wrench'd to serve oppression's coward aim, While sots “the immortal memory” pledge, and slaves insult thy name; Still be that name enshrined in every British breast, On ours, and on our fathers' heads the foul dishonour rest! Our altars, and our rights, our fame by land and sea, Our smiling fields, our pleasant homes, are consecrate to thee!] EPILOGUE. And now my varied song must hasten to its close: To tell of Britain's after fates demands severer prose, The tribute of the heart, for temper'd freedom due, A scheme more wise than ever sage of Rome or Athens drew; Scheme not by man contrived, by no strait fetters tied, For what it merits least, alike, most vaunted and decried. But oh! be ours the task, with juster sense embued, To guard the blessings which it bears with jealous gratitude; No bigot foes to change, which alter'd times demand, Nor hireling slaves to mob applause when faction tears the land: With trust in heaven reposed, that, whensoever fate Shall write Victoria's cherish'd name—(far distant be the date!—) Sixth in the monumental roll of Brunswick's line, That name amidst the noblest stars of England's host may shine; Next hers—the virgin queen, “who quell'd the pride of Spain”— But purer, milder, and more bright—the bard's true Gloriane.</field>
