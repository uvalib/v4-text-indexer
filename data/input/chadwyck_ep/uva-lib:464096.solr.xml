      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST illustrious Princesse Francis Dutchesse of Lenox, Countesse of Hertford and Richmond. Sweet Philomela's long concealed woe, From darke obliuion now I bring to light; That (though it helpe her not) the world may know, The cause she sobbeth out her notes by night: Which to you (greatest Lady) I present, Fruit of some houres I with the Muses spent. It is well knowne honour hath beene had By Patronizing of a worke of worth, Whilst skilfull Art did cunningly o're-shade The Patrones weaknesse, and his praise point forth: Here it's not so, my work meane, your worth main, Hereby I honour may, you none attaine. For such are you, whom Nature, beautie, grace, So faire hath fram'd, adorn'd, so well indu'd: As if those three contended had to place In you perfection, which their store hath shew'd: With whom vertue hath ioyn'd &amp; mak'st appeare, Deseruedly you moue first in this sphere. So as thou canst not by a learn'der quill Be honour'd, or receiue an equall praise Vnto thy merits, they each presse should fill, Should goe about with words thy worth to raise: In it I'le rest: thy name which doth adorne This frontispice, is my birds Aprill morne. If that your Grace doe but my labours grace, Each Lady's lodging shall a groue be thought: The Nightingale shall sing in euery place; Nay, thereby shall a miracle be wrought: For if you but my Philomela cheare, Her singing-spring-tide shall last all the yeare. Euer most humbly deuoted to your Graces seruice, Patrick Hannay. To his friend the Author. Let those that studie how to praise a friend, Or seeke to flatter him beyond desert, Shake hands with me, for I haue no such end, That befits him that hath a fawning hart: I only care to let the Author know I loue him, and his booke for vertues sake: His worke, his worth vnto the world doth show, Which for a patterne doth his practise take. It needs no sycophant to set it forth, (The wine is good you well the bush may scorne:) My praise-defectiue should detract the worth, Which with such lustre doth each leafe adorne. All I will say is this, it's done so well, Some may come nie; some match, but none excell. Edward Leuenthorpe. To my louing Kinsman the Author. Thy Philomela's sad (yet well sung) note, Wrong'd Sheretine and Mariana's loue: Home's Husband: Anna's Elegies so wrote, Thy Songs and Sonnets passion deepe did moue; Doe well approue that thy ingenious wit, For euery measure, euery subiects fit. Robert Hannay. To his much respected friend Master Patrick Hannay. Hannay thy worth bewrayes well whence thou'rt sprung, King Galdus (that Worthie) who so brauely fought with the Romans, lies buried in the lands of Patricke Hannay of Kirkdale in Galloway. And that that honour'd Name thou dost not wrong: As if from Sorby's stock no branch could sprout, But should with Rip'ning-time beare golden fruit: Thy Ancestors were euer worthy found, Else Galdus graue had grac'd no Hannay's ground: Thy fathers father Donald well was knowne To th' English by his sword, but thou art showne To them by pen, (times changing) Hannay's are Actiue in acts of worth be't peace or warre. Goe on in vertue, After-times will tell, None but A Hannay could haue done so well. Io. Marshall. Of the Author. Reader I'm briefe, this Poem's pend so well, Of Muses nine his is the Philomel. Iohn Harmar. To his friend the Author. Laus tua, non tua res, cogit me scribere, vultus Gratia sic dulcis: os facit haud jubet ars. M eonian Chorus now incline to me, A ssist my muse from your Parnassus hie: S ome influence infuse you in my braine, T hat I this Author in a higher straine E fforc'd may be to praise: a simple wit R are ones to praise, nor able is nor fit. P ierian vertues with Homerian wit, A ffixed are to thy ingenious braine: T he penning of these Poems proueth it R ais'd from obliuion in a loftie veine: I n this our age (though many doe affect C unning in verse, and would be counted rare) K now I none worthy of the like respect, E uer greene Lawrell must fall to thy share. H erein yet doe I nothing flatter thee, A lthough in part thy parts I doe display: N or none will doubt thereof that doth thee see, N eedlesse were faining where such vertues sway: A rt shewes it selfe by thy sweet flowing pen, Y eelding the Wreath to thee from rarest men. I.M.C. To the Author. Here view the Map of greatnesse, regall states, Kings throwne from thrones, crownes throwne from royall Mates: Where trech'rous greed to raigne, ambitious ends Maine rights diuide, intrude false foes for friends: Here trie the course of warres, there see that stem, The awfull Scepter, glorious Diadem, Which once Hungarian Kings, maiesticke sweyd, (Borne to command, though neuer well obeyd) How reard, subuers'd, replac'd, defac'd againe, Their Kingdome (vncontinu'd) did remaine. But what in Thee, (than rare) I most admire, Is this fierce flame, fraught with Castalian fire; Thy pleasant straine, fram'd in this art diuine And quicke inuention, th' essence of engine; Wherein Apollo harpes, the Muses prance The font-drawn forked sharps, with glemings glance This tragick tune to grace; the Nimphs adorne Thee, with immortall fame, of liues forlorne: So do thy Liricks, set in tripping measures Show skilful wit, sprung from Alcinoes treasures. Which swim on Demthen, sweet Permessen pleasures: Thus may thy worth, thy curious works Thee raise, Few haue deseru'd (or can attaine) more praise. William Lithgow. In Imaginem. T'expresse the Authors face, brasse, inke &amp; Art Haue done their best, but for his better part The Grecian Philomel in English tongue Marian, a Husband, Elegies well sung, Haue giuen a touch, as in a clowdie night Obscured PhÅbe shewes her vailed light; And at some turnes where clouds doe ill cohere, With full beames shines out from her siluer sphere; So are his shaded passages of wit, (Where birds doe speake, and women in a fit:) Who could so well haue told faire Marians wrong, Or taught the Athenian bird a London song, As he to whom the depth of loue is knowne, And caruing others can cut out his owne: Which in some part is here so well exprest, None but himselfe can represent the rest. Robert Alane. PHILOMELA, The Nightingale. Philomela, or the Nightingale, which here followes, is to be sung (by those that please) to the tune set downe before in the frontispiece. THE ARGVMENT. Pandion King of Athens, takes a wife, He dearly loues her, she him with like strife: They issue haue, two daughters (who excell) Progne the faire; and fairer Philomel. Fortune befriends not long, death her surpriseth: Pandion grieues, new cause of griefe ariseth. Barbarians him inuade, the Thracian King Them foyles; and succours to the sieg'd doth bring. Hee's entertain'd; Cupid with louing fires Of Progne warmes him; shee hath like desires. Hee wooes, shee's wonne, her father's glad he sped: With Princely pompe they solemnly doe wed. Tereus with Progne vnto Thrace returnes: Thrace ioies therfore, therfore sad Athens mourns. Fiue yeeres in Thrace they glad together liue, Progne for Philomela ginnes to grieue: Longs for her sight, her husband doth intreat, To worke a way they may together meet. Hee yeelds, takes sayle, to Athens backe returnes, Vnlawfull loue of Philomel him burnes. Her natiue beautie, and her rich attire. Inrich'd by cunning Art he doth admire. With lust inrag'd he sore Pandion prest That she might with him goe, at last did wrest Vnwilling grant: he her commits with teares To Tereus charge, his loue suspecting feares. Hee takes his faith, moues her to swift returne; They weeping part, Pandion left doth mourne. They sayle, see shoare, they land, no more delay Tereus can brooke, nor doth hee her assay By words, knowing it bootlesse: to a wood Hee drew her, spoke his thought; amaz'd she stood. Hee forc'd, shee faints; reuiu'd, reuenge of wrong Shee vow'd to take; hee fearefull lest her tongue Should blaze his crime, he cuts 't out with his blade, That woefull wood a prison for her made. Then home returnes, faineth her Funerall, Progne her mournes, shee vnto worke doth fall, Of party-coloured wooll by skilfull Art, A web shee made that did her woes impart. Progne a sharpe reuenge doth vndertake; Time fauours her designes with Bacchus wake, Shee takes her out, comes home, her flattring childe Shee kills and dresses; fury made her wilde: To his sire for food she giues him, hee doth eat His owne flesh; his fault Progne lets him weat, The sisters he persues, with rage he burn'd, Both hee and they on sudden birds are turn'd. Walking I chanc'd into a shade, Which top-in-twining trees had made Of many seuerall kinds. There grew the high aspiring Elme, With boughes bathing in gum-like balm, Distilling through their rinds. The Maple with a skarry skinne Did spread broad pallid leaues: The quaking Aspine light and thinne To th' ayre light passage giues: Resembling still The trembling ill Of tongues of womankinde, Which neuer rest, But still are prest To waue with euery winde. The Mirtle made of nought but sweets, Loue-loathing Daphne's of-spring greets, whose top no steele ere lop'd; Nor vnder-boughes with biting beasts Returning from their fodder-feasts, for banket nere had crop'd. The lowly bankes did bath in dew, which from the tops distild: There Eglantine and Iuy grew, sweet Mint and Margiram wilde: With many more, Pomona's store Was plentifully plac'd, That nought did want, Nor seemed scant, To please sight, sent, or taste. The blooming borders fresh and faire, Were clad with cloathes of colours rare, Which fairest Flora fram'd: The Hyacinth, the selfe-lou'd lad, Adonis. Amaranthus sad, there pleasing places claim'd. The Primrose pride of pleasing Prime, with Roses of each hew: The Cowslip, Pinke, and sauory Thyme, and Gilly-flower there grew. The Marygold, Which to behold Her louer loaths the night, Locking her leaues Shee inward grieues, When Sol is out of sight. Vpon the boughs and tops of trees, Blyth birds did sit as thicke as Bees on blooming Beanes doe bait: And euery Bird some louing noat Did warble thorow the swelling throat to wooe the wanton mate. There might be heard the throbbing Thrush, the Bull-finch blyth her by; The Blacke-bird in another bush, with thousands more her nie. The ditties all, To great and small, Sweet Philomel did set, In all the grounds Of Musicke sounds, Those darlings did direct. With pleasure which that place did bring, Which seem'd to me perpetuall spring, I was inforc'd to stay: Leaning me lowly on the ground, To heare the sweet cÅlestiall sound These Syluanes did bewray. Rauish'd with liking of their songs, I thought I vnderstood The seuerall language to each longs, That lodges in the wood. Most Philomel Did me compell To listen to her song, In sugred straines, While she complaines Of tyrant Tereus wrong. Compos'd to sing her saddest dit, Shee shrowded in a shade did sit, vnder a budding bryar; Whose thicknesse so debar'd the light, It seem'd an artificiall night, leaues link'd in loue so neare. It seem'd she was asham'd to show her selfe in publike place, By sight, lest seers so might know Her vndeseru'd disgrace. Hid from the eie, Shee thought none nie Was for to pen her plaints; Shee 'gins relate Her aduerse fate, And thus her passion paints. When Prince Pandion held that state Which was the mirthfull Muses seat, With learning beautifide; Gouerning there with peacefull rest, Where no disturbing stormes distrest Those that did there reside: In prime of youth he tooke a Dame, By nature kinde, decor'd With beautie, vertue vow'd that frame Should with her gifts be stor'd. I know not which Did seeme most rich, By lauishnesse in giuing; Each gaue so much, I thinke none such Was left amongst the liuing. With equall heat loue so combin'd Their hearts, as they were still inclin'd to nill and will the same: Their mindes so mingled were together, They had nought proper vnto either, both fires one common flame. Thus surfetting on loues delight, where with a matching measure The one the other doth requite in equall pitch of pleasure, Their daies they spent In sweet content, Deeming all others wretched, Whose lesser ioyes, Mixt with annoyes, To their full height not stretched. To adde vnto their happinesse, And further to increase their blisse, the heauenly powers conspire, Of which they (Ioy-drownd) did not dreame, So perfect did their pleasures seeme, they could no more desire. Yet was their comfort so increast, with of-springs happy store, As now they thinke they were not blest With benefits before. Thus is it knowne That none doth owne So much of earthly pleasure, But that the heart, A little part, May hold a greater measure. We were by Muses nine nurst vp, We drunke with Heliconian cup, their number did increase, The goodly gifts, the graces three Gaue to vs, we did multiply to number numberlesse. No syllable could from vs slide, but in consenting sound, Our lookes, and gestures, who espide, The graces in them found. Each had such feature, And good stature, As iust proportion grac'd, With colours rare To make vs faire, By Natures pensill plac'd. Thus did both heauen and earth conspire To fill our Fathers deare desire, with heaped happinesse. But when things heere are at the hight, Vnlookt for lot doth often light, and driues them to distresse. As when the Moone hath fild her horne, shee straight begins to waine, And when the flowing force is worne, the tyde then turnes againe: For heere no state Is free from fate, With Time all turnes about: Oft rise the small, The great oft fall, When they doe nothing doubt. If pleasures heere were permanent, Free from disturbing discontent, not any wayes annoy'd, Wee should not relish our delights, So dull should be our appetites, with senslesse surfet cloy'd. Therefore that we may better taste, each sweet hath many sowres, The brightest blinck is quickly past, and banished with showres: Also to show That we doe owe To changing time, wee're tost When least we feare, It is most neere, And our designes are crost. So with my father did it fare, Whom megre death did vnaware depriue of his belou'd My mother; sicknesse so her seis'd, As paine it selfe did seeme displeas'd, and senses all remou'd: Shee seis'd with ceaselesse sleep, gaue first Pandion cause of cares; Which Athens woe soone after nurst, and bath'd in brinie teares. Thus euer still Preceding ill Is followed fast with more: Nere comes alone One cause of moane, Its company'd with store. Before her death-bred griefe was swag'd, Barbarians were so inrag'd, (Gaping for greedy gaine, Incourag'd by his carelesnesse, Whom they deem'd drunken with excesse, they doubt not to obtaine.) As they wall'd round rich Athens wals, with warriors about, So fainting feare our force appal's, it dares no where looke out, Feare forc'd some sound, And did confound In others resolution, All were deiected, So vnexpected, Was Fortunes reuolution. In midst of this our great distresse, Which did our former feares increase, Such troupes we did behold, As with their brau'ry brau'd the skies, And dazled the beholders eyes, with beame-rebating gold, In front with lofty plume in pride, mounted on starely Steed, The likeliest of all did ride, who seem'd the rest to leade, Curuetting oft, Pransing aloft, His Courser proud disdaines To be controld By Bit of gold, Scorning commanding raines. But when he did approch more neare, He banished that former feare conceiued by his sight: He forc'd our foes soone to retire, Who to resist had small desire, they faintly fell in flight. We mused much what he should be, who with vnasked aid, So suddenly did set vs free, and all our foes dismay'd; All ran to see, As he came nye, And fixt on him their sight, And all those eies Which him espies, Were taken with delight. The streetes as he did passe along, With gold were garnished and hung, all brauely beautifide; The pauement pau'd with pleasing flowres, The spoiles of Flora's fragrant bowres, where Tereus did ride: Such was his name who vs restor'd, of warlike Thracia King, Whom in triumphant wise decor'd, my father in did bring: In manner meet Each other greet, And kindly entertaine: T'his Palace faire, To solace there, He brings him and his traine. There banquetting with dainties best, To please the too too curious tast, which sea or land doth yeeld, With sweet discourses mixt among, Where a delightfull pleasing tongue did roue in Reth'rick field. When Tereus saw my sister faire, Progne he pric'd her such, As he beleeu'd no beauties were beside, she had so much. His heart desires, His eye admires Her pleasing forme and feature: He thinkes all else Shee farre excells In goodly gifts of Nature. When that his fancy on her face Doth feed, there growes no other grace, hee thinkes in other parts: It seemes the curious Cabinet, Where Nature had that treasure set that most bewitches hearts. A rowling eye, whence thousand flights of gold-dipt-darts doe flye; Whereof the least with loue delights could wound a deitie. Th' alluring glances Which by chances From those two sunnes did dart, Loue borow'd still, When he had will To fire a frosty heart. A forehead where in-thronizit Graue maiesty in state did sit, with humblenesse attyr'd; Where meeknes made the meaner hope, And maiestie cut short the scope of Pride, that high aspir'd. Soft wauing Seas of sable haire, that hew was iudg'd by loue The best, and aptest to insnare, milde Zephyrus did moue. In carelesse curles, He oft it hurles, He wantonnesse bewrayes: He oft it flung Her backe along, And beautie best displaies. A cheeke where purest white, with red Of deepest dye, was ouer-spred, and meeting so were mixt, As neither red nor white they seeme, But both in one made beauties beame, these colours two betwixt. Her ruby lips when they doe kisse, couer prime pearly rowes; When they that kinde coniunction misse, Arabian sweet out-flowes: One sure would thinke, As shee did drinke, That bloud light Bacchus fils, That it did passe, As through a glasse, Gray Claret wine distils. What shame permits not to espie, He with Imaginations eie Doth see, and values most: He viewes it o're, and o're againe, Seekes for a fault, but all in vaine, His labour there was lost. Its seldome seene but some defect, By prudent Nature's plac'd, To make the best be more respect, With glory more be grac'd; Yet no where here There doth appeare Least foile, all was so faire, As fir'd him so, He did not know, To hope, or to despaire. Thus was he first enamoured, And still his louing fancie fed, While on her face he gaz'd, His prying prest a beautie-blush, In crimson coat, her face to flush, In Cupids fire it blaz'd. Thus forc'd with fainting feuers fit, His quaking heart did tremble, Where loue's deepe grounded, there's no wit Can his sure signes dissemble. He cooles and burnes, Heart inward mournes, He hopes, he oft doth feare; Shee may consent, May not relent, May yeeld, may chance not heare. My father (as Physitian good) By signes his sicknesse vnderstood, (Hauing like passion prou'd) He knew the salue could soonest slacke His sicknesse, and his paine beat backe, Was Progne, his belou'd. By matching him and her, he thinkes Such friendship to indeare, As bound by wedlocks holy linkes, He needes no foe to feare. Thus policie, Long time we see, Hath euer had two ends, One is a traine, But still the maine To priuate profit tends. He giues these louers leaue together, Tereus speakes not alone left with her, But in his heart doth pray That she had boldnesse to begin, In such a muse his minde was in, He knew not what to say: Still rumbling is the little Ryll, Deepe Riuers silent moue; That deepest passion is most still, Experience doth proue. He much doth feare Shee will not heare, If he good will should proffer, His often dread, Not to come speed, Driues him he dares not offer. Shee muses thus to see him mute, Shee feares hee follow not his sute, (Which she deemes her vndoing.) When he resolued had to speake, What he should say, he had to seeke, (He was not wise in wooing.) When plainly we our passion tell, It maketh much in mouing, A simple innocence so well, Bewrayes a heart much louing: For euer those Who (apt to glose) Too speedy are in speech, Loue doe not show, But make Maids know, They kindly can beseech. His speeches had more pleasing sound, With Rhetorick did more abound, Vnto my sisters sense, Then theirs who by their skilfull Art, With Sophistrie can truth peruert, To cleare a foule offence. Shee willingly doth heare him wooe, Shee's pleas'd to heare him plead, Shee could at first encounter, bow, But doubts doe make her dread Lest quickly woon, He should haue done, His fancie should take flight: Oft soone obtain'd, Are soone disdain'd: Such loue is counted light. Thus on shee drawes him with delay, Shee neither grants, nor giues a nay, (For feare he flee the field;) Her yeelding blush doth make him bold, To re-inforce, and to vnfold All meanes to make her yeeld; He vowes, protests, and deeply sweares, His loue to her shall neuer Languish, with length of lingring yeares, Nor faith faile he doth giue her. I grant, shee said, No more he staid, But at her word did take her, With purple red, All ouer-spred, Sweet Virgin shame did make her. My father knowing th'had decreed To wed, and were thereon agreed, He left his pawsing paine: For he had mused in his minde, To make her heart thereto inclinde, And beat his busie braine. Now all doe haste with like desire, To solemnize those rites, Which holy Hymen doth require, 'fore lawfull loue-delights. They make such haste, The time they chac't, Which little list makes long, The smallest stay That doth delay Inioying's iudg'd a wrong. The longed day is come should crowne Their wish'd desires, sweet Dorick soune Doth deafe the itching eare, Shrill eccho in the rocks did ring, Repeating what the sisters sing In Prince Apollo's quier; Kind Natures Quiristers increast, Mounting in crystall skies, The gods inuite vnto this feast, Which angry-heauen denies. They did enuie Felicitie Should such on earth be seene: To Tragicke end These ioyes should tend, The grieued gods doe meane. The furies brands aloft did beare For Hymenean candles cleare, Which lent a dismall light: The Rauen and the night-Crow cry, The ominous Owle abroad doth fly By day, and not by night. Iuno that blesseth first the bed Of happy wedded louers, Came not, in saffron colours clad, Hymen affrighted, houers, Not daring there Make his repaire, (With presage dire dismai'd.) The Muses dread, The Graces fled, They were no lesse afraid. Yet did they dally in delights, And reuell at vnhallowed rites, Till time, (which nought can stay) Told Tereus his loue-delaies, His home-left-Thracian dismaies, Their comfort gan decay. They feare his safety, he farewell Must bid, Progne doth plaine: A pearly showre of liquid haile Out o're her cheekes did raine. A tender heart, Such bitter smart, With sorrow doth suppresse, When bitter cup Doth interrup New tasted happinesse. Yet bootes it not, she must be gone, Tereus her traines (though weeping) on, And we alike lament: Our sorrow so diuided was, Halfe with vs staid, and halfe did passe, Whither that Couple went. They shipp'd, a lusty gale of winde So prosp'rously did blow, The sailes suffice fild from behinde, There needeth none to row: They soone came nie, Where they would be, And doe perceiue the land; They see the shore All peopled o're With those he did command. For Fame the Ayrie winged Post, (By going greater) fils the cost Of Thrace, with comming-cries; Her trumpet sounds his safe returne, The shores with blazing-beacons burn, Where cries confus'dly rise, Which vntir'd Eccho in the hils, (With her redoubling voice) So multiplies, the aire it fils; The gods seeme to reioyce: The multitude Confus'dly stood Vpon the sheluie shore, He happiest seemes Next Neptunes streames, Can draw, though drowne therefore. The smaller (yet the sager) sort, Doe minde a more Maiestick sport, Rough rudenesse they disdaine; Most stately triumphs they deuise, After the victors gorgious guise, Tereus to entertaine. Altars with Incence sweetly smoke, Priests Io-PÃ¦an sing: The tottering steeples reele and rocke, (So rowling bells doe ring.) This day so glad, To those they adde Which sacred they obseru'd, From yearely mirth For Itys birth, His first-borne they nere sweru'd. What time Tytan our height had scal'd, Summer had sweat, winter had hail'd, Autumne had fild her lap, Fiue times the Spring in fragrant flowres Was deck'd, warme sliding sunnie showres The soaking earth did sap. When pleasing Progne's longing loue For Philomela's sight Grew wake-rife, and such thoughts did moue, As lessens large delight, When we depart From what our hart With liking once hath lou'd, Absence intires, And more indeares, The more it is remou'd. This absence kindling longing-loue, Makes Progne all her practiques proue, Deferres not her desire. Woman (who would) delay disdaines, Who doth denie, and who detaines With hope, hath equall hire. Fearing refusall, she puts on A looke that most allures, And drawes the eie, nor that alone, Her of her suit assures. Such weightie words Her wit affords, As for to moue were meet, With louing charmes Him in her armes Kissing, doth thus intreat. Dearer to me then sweet repose To Misers, seiz'd with ceaselesse woes, Who nere of comfort tasted; More pleasing to me then is light Vnto the sillie sleeplesse wight, Whom waking nights haue wasted, Who present putst those feares to flight, Which absent make me die: As Titan makes the vgly night, With forcing flames to flie; Me thinkes farre more I now adore, Loue more, if such desire Could be increast, Which when at least, Was such could soare no higher. Great loue in length doth often dull; Mine, (though so maine) is not at full, It daily doth increase: No intermission makes it stay, No surfet takes its edge away, It growes, but neuer lesse: Which by effects may be perceau'd, For since I first was fir'd, No other happinesse I crau'd, Than doe as you desir'd: My chiefest grace, I there did place, Held that my high'st content, Gladdest did passe The time that was In louing seruice spent. Dost think I doubt (the Prince replies;) Meane-while looks babies in her eies, And dallies with delight; Kinde kisses on her fairest face, With soft impressions he doth place, Her lips haue no respite; Her prettie parlie so doth please, Her lips so sweetly taste: He doubts, which rather he had leese, Both are to be imbrac'd. He bids her say, Yet still doth stay With kissing her discourse, Whilst from her lips He Nectar sips, As from celestiall sowrse. Speake loue (he said) then she proceeds, If fauour so affect my deeds, As deeme them of desert, I'le boldly beg, but such a suit, As kindnesse cannot so confute, But I shall ease my heart, Since fate from fairest Philomel (With that she deeply sigh'd) And destinies haue doom'd me dwell, To make the losse more light, Suffer me sweet (If you thinke meet) I may my selfe goe see, Or else deuise, Some other wise, That she may come to me. The goodliest gift that thou canst giue, I for this grant with liking leaue, It seemes to me the best: Promise Pandion swift returne, Whose aged eies will ouer-runne, At this vnlook'd request. Thus hauing said with kinde imbrace, Him in her armes she clings, With soaking teares bedewes his face, Forc'd from her sunnie springs: She doth attend, How he will end, To doe, or to denie: With speaking signes, She him intwines, Who makes her this replie: What is this all? sweet, sue for more, Thou seem'st a niggard of my store, Out of my kingdome cull: And eke vnto thy late request Seeke more, so more I shall be blest, By being bountifull. She only this: He more would adde, If he knew fit propine: It seemes so slender he is sad, None dearer can diuine. Thus they doe proue, Which most should loue, That only was their strife, Which breeds no warres, Nor iealous jarres, Twixt happie man and wife. Then did he haste him to the Sea, That she might wit how willingly Hee granted her desire. I leaue the pitious plaints to tell, That passion powr'd at this farewell; Progne did nie expire. Nor was this forc'd affection, fain'd To moue a more beleefe Of sincere loue, the teares that rain'd, Sprung from an inward griefe: Let Ariost His foule-mouth'd host Of Iocund's parting prate: Whose wife did swound, But of that wound A Groome the griefe did bate. This was not such, but as the show, Such was the substance of the woe, Which thus their soules possest. For she like lonely Doue doth languish; Hee goes with griefe where bitter anguish Bides in his boiling brest. At last Pireus Port he spies: The Sailers raise a song, The Countrie wakened with their cries, Vnto the shore doe throng: They feed their sight With sweet delight Of this vnlook'd for guest; They thrust him so, Hee scarce can goe, Rude people so him prest. Pandion's state the street refraines, Yet at the gate him entertaines, And louingly imbrac'd. The right hand friendships firmest pledge, They mutually for loue ingage, (Yet no good signes it grac'd:) Without inquirie he doth tell The cause why he doth come, Is for his sister Philomel, (Fresh beauties budding bloome:) The presage bad, His speech then had, My future ill diuin'd: It lowring brake, That day of wracke, Which dismall deadly shin'd. The glad congratulation past, Hee goes on with his Heart's behest, Which had him thither brought. Hee tels how pleasing Progne pines, Her mirth with melancholy dwines, In solitarie thought. Hee tels how for her Philomel, Progne did pensiue long: All her discourse on her doth dwell, Shee wholly hath her tong: He doth request, With speeches best, And aptest to perswade: As yet the end To nought did tend, But his loues-life to glade. Straight he doth after me inquire, Who him to see had like desire, I to his presence rush'd. He at my sight amazed grew, He staid astonish'd at my view, (My face such fairenesse flush'd) Our salutations had no touch Of complementing straines: Light loue is lauish where it's much, From flatterie it refraines: He kist, imbrac't, About my waste His winding armes he wrung: I did him meet With loue as great, And to his body clung. My goodly garment all of gold, His griping made his eies behold, And note more narrowly: For though my robe it selfe were rich, Musing Minerua's stately stitch; It more did beautifie. Shee had made it the master-peece Of all her studious store. Art, Art it selfe to passe did presse, Her cunning to decore. Reuiewing still, Deeming all ill (Though well) if skill could better, So iealousie The sliest spie, To needlesse worke did set her. There was Apollo in a chaire Of burnish'd gold, his flame-like haire Against that brightnesse beam'd, An Iuorie Harpe with siluer strings, With trembling touch which lightly rings, Did sound or sounding seem'd. With leauie-Lawrell he was crownd, And Canopied o're head, Wherein chaste Daphne lately wound, Did quiuer yet for dread. The slender flim, Which hid each lim, So offerd to the eie; And was so wrought, You would haue thought It to be Maid and tree. Her leauie toppe (late haire) did shade The Welkin, part it twy-light made, And part a mirthfull morne, For lower was an azur'd skie, Where Easterne beames did beautifie Halfe, halfe the starres adorne. Among the slender boughs some birds Their listning eares incline, Others houer about in heards, To heare these Dits diuine: Som's swelling brest The ioy exprest, To heare how they did earne: Som's opening bill Bewrai'd the Will These wantons had to learne. A little lower from this state, Where Prince Apollo proudly sate, With brightnesse ouerblowne: The merrie Muses rang'd in rankes, Were seated on the sunnie bankes, With sauourie sweets ore-growne: While one doth tune her Lute, or voice, One notes, one time doth measure. A silent sound, an vnheard noise Doth take the sight with pleasure: Some garments graue, Others did haue Some light, some long, some short, Some Chaplets wore, And some forbore, Some mus'd, and some made sport. Neerer the border one might see Orpheus and Euridice, Returning from the dead: He plaid, and with swift pace did haste, Longing till she our aire should taste, Whom he to light did lead: But whether a desire of sight, Or feare she did not follow, Made him looke backe, his deare delight The opening earth did swallow: Hee quickly snatch'd, And would haue catch'd, But when it prou'd in vaine, Her looke did shrieke, And in his cheeke, Pale griefe was pictur'd plaine. A sea circled the lowest seame, With welling waues, and of that streame The people pastime take: Fearefull on fish Arion sits, Hee seeming seiz'd with quaking fits, Did mournfull musicke make. The Dolphins dance now vp, now down, And as much pleasure haue, As he hath paine, for feare to drowne, He sings his life to saue, His hands scarce hold (With feare and cold Benumb'd) his Instrument: The swelling waue The motion gaue, The sauing sound that lent. This gorgeous garment large and wide, Before was with a button ti'de, And carelesse hung about: My fore-part was of purest Lawne, Wheron the fairest flowres were drawne, That Nature ere brought out: Their roots a seeming-earth did hide, Clad in a grassie greene; The stalke stood out, as if beside The ground a growing sien: Some thought a sent Out from them went; (So wrought they on conceat,) One maketh faith, He tasted hath Some leafe that fell of late. Thus was I cloth'd. My brest was bare, Neuer till then was white so faire, Which made the world profane, And dare the mighty gods vpbraid, That they such purenesse neuer made, Nor could to such attaine. Whereat the gods incensed grew, And did together 'gree, Euen with a curse their skill to shew, Blaming worlds-blasphemie. No yeare doth faile, But snow or haile Since candies o're the earth, Whose ioy doth vanish, For it doth banish The beautie of its birth. Yet he had not well view'd my face, Which beautie-bringing-years did grace With raies of most respect: The buds he left so faire had flourish'd, So kindly Nature had them nourish'd, As he did not expect. The Infant-lustre lightly laid, Was curiously ore-run, And carefull Nature perfit made Her beautie-boord begun: Each lineament Shee did acquaint With a proportion due, And euery lim, Fashion'd so trim, Was hid in heauenly hue. The fauour of my face was such, That beautie else though nere so much, (If that I came in place) Was but a foile to make mine fairer, That fairenesse made mine seeme the rarer, That glory gaue mine grace. As former eie-contenting flowres Lose lustre by the Rose, As PhÅbe's glore eclipsed lowres, When Sol his sight out throwes: Euen so did mine Others out shine, Though faire in their degree; The lookes they lost, Which made them boast, If paraleld with me. Some would say Venus, when at rarest, And fancied most for to be fairest, (With Adon hot in loue) Look'd like me, but that I more chaste, Look'd constant, she did care to cast Such lookes as lust could moue. Others would say such Dian's looke (But more to wrath inclinde) When haplesse (bathing in a brooke) Acteon did her finde. Of goddesses They did expresse The goodly gifts by mine, Not mine by theirs, Their doome declares They deem'd me more diuine. These, these the tyrant so admir'd, As with their sight his heart was fir'd With more then lawfull loue: He now thinks Progne's parts were poore: He wonders how they could allure, Or his affection moue. He wishes now he were vnwed, So I would heare him wooe. He sighes, he with my sister sped, Or had with her to doe: As parched hay, Whereto we lay Quicke fire, takes sudden flame, So burn'd his heart With euery dart That light-like from me came. Hee's so inrag'd, he would not spare To tempt my fellowes faithfull care, (If that could doe the deed) My Nurses faith, nay e'en my selfe Hee would seduce with precious pelfe, If so he could come speed; He cares not for the Kingdomes broile To take me thence perforce, And to maintaine his rauish'd spoile By slaughter'd-soules diuorce: His reinlesse loue So much doth moue, What is it but he dares? Nor can his brest Those flames inuest, Which prouocate his cares. Nor can he now delay indure, He thinkes with cunning to procure, Doth Progne's sute renew; He makes it cloake his damn'd desire, When more then right he did require, So Progne did persue, He would affirme, his tongue did glose, (Louers are eloquent) E'en mouing teares his cheeks oreflowes, (As if those Progne sent) How humane mindes, Oft error blindes, Hee's thought to be sincere, His wickednesse We kindnesse guesse, Which doth him more indeare. Behold I for the same doe sue, About my fathers necke I threw My armes, and him imbrace, I Maiden kisses intermixt, He notes them, for his eye is fixt Still on my firing-face: Each kisse he (couetous) did craue, He wisht he were my sire, I to him sought, each gesture gaue Food to his fond desire. My sire at last, By our request, Against his will is won: Hauing obtain'd, I good had gain'd Did deeme, but was vndone. Now Phebus steeds so swift had runne, His daily course was almost done, The hight they passed haue, And now the steepy sky they beat With angry hoofes, to coole their heat, Hasting in Westerne waue. On table kingly cates were plac'd For to content the taste, Blithe Bacchus golden goblets grac'd, After this rich repast, To quiet rest Each him addrest, But Tereus tiring-care Lets silken sleepe On him to creepe, His woes so wake-rife are. The true Idea of each part He saw, was seated in his heart: What was hid from the sight, He faines it such as he would haue it, And better then sight could conceiue it, More delicate delight; He thinkes he sees face, feature, gate, And doth suruey each lim, So apprehensiue quicke conceat Did represent to him. The night was worne, A weeping morne Vsherd the dolefull day, When hastning fate, Full of deceit, Permits no longer stay. Pandion then with gushing eyes, Where gorged griefe a bathing lies, Me to him thus betakes: This Iewell (dearest sonne) this pearle My last, most lou'd, my dearest girle, (His hand then shiuering shakes) I giue thee, and thy faith coniure By all the gods aboue, To guard, her safety to assure With a paternall loue: Let knowen bed Which you haue had, In firmnesse keepe your faith, And beare in minde What Progne kinde With me committed hath. And darling, now my sweetest stay, My ages hope, that from decay Detaines these turning haires, Whose presence doth me primely nourish, Whose sight yet makes this face to flourish, And curbes my comming cares: Sweet Philomel, I thee beseech Thou wouldst with speed returne: While thou art absent, I must teach These moistned eies to mourne. Though loth to want, Three Months I grant, (So long to stay you haue) One day behinde That time assign'd, Will bring me to my graue. Thus speaks he with teare-dropping eies, Drowned in his braine-breeding seas, Which doth his sorrow tell. I seeme to goe, and oft turne backe, And slender slips excuses make To take a fresh farewell. Such was kinde Ouid's lingring leaue Departing from his wife, And so did Cleopatra grieue, Pittie produc'd like strife, CÃ¦sario goe, O doe not, no, Flye from Augustus snare; Nay stay a while, Fortune may smile, Yet goe, it's best beware. So far'd it here, so we intreat, Kiss'd, amongst kisses still we wet Our cheekes with mixed teares: To firme our faith he takes our hands, Ioynes them, and mute amazed stands, Full fraught with future feares. At last, Ioue witnesse this (he saies) And punish those offend, And daughter doe not vse delaies, To Progne me commend: Scarce speakes he more, He faints so sore, As if his spirits were past, Yet bids farewell, Which seemes to tell, (With staying) 'twas the last. The night which did this day precede, Did wrap it selfe in mourning weede Of saddest sable hew, Such pitchie clouds were interpos'd, Phebe was hid, small starres were los'd, Their splendor none did view. At day Aurora's eies so wept As drunke each hill and dale, As if for Memnon now she kept The sad fresh funerall, Her eies did soake The parched cloake Which Tellus then had on, The grasse out sprung From clay was clung, At fall of Phaeton. Thus parted, we vnto the sea, Our canuas wings we doe display Against the growing gale, Which their resistance takes in scorne, Whereby the bulke is forward borne By proudly swelling saile. Though watry hils were interpos'd, Yet followed he with sight, Till his dim dazled eies were clos'd, 'Fore their time bringing night: Returning then He doth complaine His late receiued losse, Vs mounting waues, And falling graues, With stubborne billowes tosse. Now Tereus can no more containe His (yet hid) ioy, it is so maine, Which vanting voice doth vent. The day is ours, the prize is won, My loue whose light obscures the Sun, Whose beames breed more content, Goes with me: hath her sorrowing-sire (Who did her so much tender) Twin'd with her? or drunke with desire, Doe I dreame he doth send her? Rowse, rowse you spirits, Conceited sweets Of a fantastique loue No power haue So to bereaue, Nor can such pleasure moue. Thus saies he; nor doth turne aside His eies from me, which still doe bide Beholding with delight: As Adamant the Iron drawes By Natures close compelling lawes, So did I draw his sight: Looke as the Eagle sharpe doth prie Vpon his panting prey, Which in his cruell clawes doth lie Hopelesse to scape away: So he beheld, So I compeld Was for to wait his will, Whom yet in minde I counted kinde, Not conscious of ill. Our fleeing sailes had made such haste, That now the tedious trauel's past, The toiling sea brings forth: We touch vpon the tyrants coast, Where haplesse I alasse was lost, And left of little worth. To shore the tired troopes doe hie, Refreshment there to finde: The anchor'd-bulke lies at a bay, With saile strooke from the winde. All doe reioyce, With cheerefull voice, Their gesture shewes they're glad, They thinke them blest, That with such haste They happie voyage made. A winter-wasted aged wood Neere to the landing place there stood, Spoiled (with length of yeares) Of beautie, no buds it had borne For many springs, the wet had worne The trunke with tempest-teares: The barklesse boughs spreading abroad, Vnto the grassie ground Yeelded no shade, with leauie load The branches were not crownd, Whereby the heat, So sore did beat, From PhÅbus firie face: Flora for feare, Durst not draw neere To beautifie that place. The winding-Iuie with soft mosse, The bodies bound, and did imbosse The rent and ragged rinde, They wrap with warmnesse to restore Decaied age, and to decore Times ruines, 'bout them winde: It seem'd sad desolations seat Farre seuerd from resort, Where nought did grow was good of late For profit or for sport. No harmonie, From tree or skie The birds made, all was sad: The bad aspect, Shew'd the neglect That nature thereof had. Obscure bushes of fur and ferne, Confus'dly mixt, where robbers learne For to intrap the prey, Were rudely ranged here and there, Wouen with briar and bramble bare, Which close together lay; A place most fit for such a fact, For such a damn'd despight, Where mischiefe meant his part to act, And hide it from the sight. The most obdur'd, Would be obscur'd, When they commit a crime: Sin is so sham'd, Lest it be blam'd, It seekes out place and time. Thither he hales me, I did quake, My heart did faint, my lims did shake, I doubted and grew pale: I for my sister ask'd with teares, Not daring to confesse my feares; Yet that did not auaile: He did confesse his foule intent, Me to the ground he flung, His late-lou'd-haire he rudely rent, And carelesse from me wrung. I cal'd amaine, But all in vaine, On sister and on sire, On gods aboue, But could not moue Them mitigate his ire. He forc'd me, O how I did tremble! Griefe seem'd to kill, but did dissemble, And would not proue so kinde: O had I then giuen vp the ghost, Before my virgin gem was lost, As spotlesse as my minde; Then had my body without staine, In sweet Elizian shade, With the vntainted virgin-traine, A merrie mansion had, Where now alas, It hath no place, Free from tormenting thought Of that forc'd ill, Which 'gainst my will On wofull me was wrought. The harmlesse vnsuspecting Lambe, Torne from the teats of fearfull dam, By hungrie-Wolues surprise; Persu'd by mastring-Mastiffe fast, The robber leaues his prey for hast, Which much amazed lies Still doubting if it be redeem'd From such a deepe distresse, So fainting I confounded seem'd, My feare was nothing lesse: Fraught with despaire, I did not care What mischiefe might betide; As in a trance, Forsooke of sense, I for a time did bide. VVhen to my selfe I did returne, My hart did heaue, my cheeks did burne, My brest I boldly beat; Rap'd with reuenge I did not spare, As cause (though guiltlesse) face &amp; haire, So louely look'd of late, From eie no teare, from tongue no words My passion did permit. The greefe that such releefe affords, Is soone freed from his fit: With sighes and sobs, And thrilling throbs, My body did rebound. Mine eie him blam'd, Then straight asham'd, It stares vpon the ground. But when as greater griefe gaue place, Swift trickling teares did other trace, My glowing cheekes bedew'd: Obortiue words for birth-right long'd, Each pressing first, his fellow throng'd, And hastily persu'd. As respite gaue me further leaue, I rat'd him in my rage, Thinking I gaind if he did grieue, My sorrow to asswage. So raging spight Doth take delight, (Though thereby not releeu'd) To vex the heart Procur'd its smart, And glores to see it greiu'd. O periur'd, cursed, cruell wretch, To such a wickednesse to stretch, Respectlesse of the gods: Thou blinded canst them not espie, Yet doubtlesse they doe draw thee nie, With new reuenging rods. Could not Pandions praiers moue Thee keepe thy promise past, Nor Prognes charge? must mariage proue Thee base, which should make blest? A maid to staine, A bed profane With an incestuous lust, Me to deflore, My sisters whore, What can be more vniust! If there be gods, they'le be reueng'd; If not, euen I (as farre estrang'd From shame, as thou from grace) This hainous action shall proclame, Notorious shall be thy name, Hatefull in euery place. If here detain'd, with mirthlesse mones The mountaines I'le acquaint: My cries shall cause the trees and stones To pittie my complaint: To heauen I vow I shall striue how To taint him me betraid; The world shall know I was not slow To wrecke a wronged maid. These words the monster so commou'd, He hates her now he lately lou'd, For sinne hath this farewell; It relish'd, straight a loathing breeds, A minutes pleasure paine succeeds That lastingly doth dwell. Though conscience he cannot calme, Which restlesse now is rent; Whose sore to salue he knowes no balme, Yet seekes he to preuent, Lest I to Fame Should blaze his shame, He mindes with more mischiefe Still to goe on, Regardlesse growne, So name may finde releefe. Thus arm'd with hate my hands he bound Behinde my backe, my haire he wound About a stubborne tree, He drew his sword, I hoped death, Detesting a distained breath, My soule I sought to free: Yet he proues not so pittifull, but to be out of doubt That I should blab, his pincers pull My tongue with torment out: Thus ioy-bereft, No comfort left, He loos'd and left alone To Tigers wilde, Than he more milde, With wordlesse-speech to moane. Then to my sister he returnes, She asks for me, therewith he mournes, Sighes, sorrow sutes his face. He faines my Funerall, which drew The teares, which made his tale seeme true, None doubting my disgrace. Progne her precious garments gay, That daintily did decke Her ioyfull, now she laies away, And d'ons the mournfull blacke: A sable vaile To ground did traile, A Tombe for me did make, There incense burnes, And for me mournes, That needed no such wake. His flaming charriot 'bout the world, Posting through signes the Sun had hurld, And yearely course dispatch'd While there I staid. No hope of flight, My carefull keeper day and night So warily me watch'd; I dumbe could not the cause delate Of this my strict restraint; But subtile wit on woe doth wait, Cunning's to catifes lent: I cast about How to bring out His lewdnesse to the light; Which while I minde, Occasion kinde Doth offer to the sight. The blislesse briers the coat had torne The fleecie flocke had lately worne, And still retain'd that spoile: Of partie coloured wooll there was Store sticking on the stalkes, on grasse Some lay, some on the soile: A web I wrought of colour white, Letters with bloud distaind I inter-weau'd, which his despight And my cares cause containd, Thus brought to end, By signes I send Vnto my sister Queene; Nor did he know To her did goe, What these mixt markes did meane. This pettie present she ore-viewes, And narrowly doth note the hues, As she doth it vnfold. These carefull characters express'd, How dolefull I was so distress'd, She blush'd for to behold, O're her proud cheeke no teare distill'd, No bitter word brake out, With vengeance and with hate she fild, Like furie flies about: She meditates To moue the Fates To further her intent: To take reuenge By meanes most strange, Her minde is fully bent. The hellish hags, hatchers of ill, That can seduce a doubtfull will, Finding her thus inclind, Reioyc'd, and with the Furies ioynd To mould a mischiefe yet vncoin'd, So to content her minde. The crime (admitting no excuse) These Impes doe aggrauate, They malice in the minde infuse That is at height of hate; Thus doe these elues Busie themselues To banish from the minde Pittie that pleads For the misdeeds Of a deare friend vnkinde. Thousand Ideas in her braine They stampe of distinct sorts of paine, To punish each doth presse, She's loth the least of them should perish, Pittilesse-passion doth them cherish, Till growne to excesse They long for birth, the time inuites, Swolne-Bacchus feast drew neere, Which Thracian dames with solemne rites Should celebrate that yeare, Both old and young, In confus'd throng, Doe rauing run about; Like bel-dames mad That day they gad, No danger then they doubt. When Phebus fierie Car withdrew, The Queene with a selected crew Her princely palace left: The sounding brasse so beat the walls, Glib Eccho answering the calls, The crystall-couering cleft, A haire-lace of a leauy vine, About her temples twinde, A Harts hide was her habit fine, Which 'bout her she did binde, A small short speare Her shoulders beare, Thus arm'd away she hies To search the wood, Rites of that god She counterfets with cries. She with disordered furie roues Through couerts, dens, &amp; shadie groues, With whoops and hollowes lowd, So hoe, she sounds: a scarce-pac'd-path Her prying eye discouered hath, Which seem'd as staind with bloud: Her minde that mus'd on my mischance, Seeing the withered knops Of parched grasse, her sudden glance Doth deeme them bloudie drops. What first the braine Doth intertaine, There such impression takes, That oft the sight It changeth quite, And false resemblance makes. So wast with her, which makes her more Long for reuenge then theretofore, She hasts, she thinkes she heares My wofull plaint, she presseth on, My prison dore a moss-growne stone Shee breakes and bushes teares; Shee takes me out, she hides my face With blooming Hather sweet: Shee doth with Bacchus liuery grace Me, as the time was meet: Shee leads me home, Where when I come, My panting brest bewray'd That my poore heart With bitter smart And sorrow was assai'd. She hauing found a fitting place To vent her woe, vnuailes my face, Off Bacchus tokens takes; She stares on me, I on the ground, A guiltlesse-shame did me confound, My face flame it makes: With scalding eares she striues to stench The feruor of my face, Yet could not her eie-conduits quench My fires, fed by disgrace. If I had had A tongue to plead, I had apologiz'd, And sworne, constrain'd I had beene stain'd, Shee 'gainst my will displeas'd. My eloquence did so preuaile, Which in sad silence told my tale, It deepe impression tooke: Shee reades the story in my face Of her wrong, and of my disgrace, Pointed with pitties looke. My teares that trickled downe amaine Shee blames, that's not the way (Sayes shee in anger and disdaine) My fury to allay: It's fire and sword Must meanes afford, To take a sharpe reuenge; Or if ought els Their force excels In torment nere so strange. While thus she speakes, her pretty childe Itys came, whom with lookes vnmilde Shee eies: how like his sire He lookes? (her heart could not afford Her woe-ty'd tongue another word, Swelling with inward ire) Yet comes he nie, and 'bout her necke He winds his wanton armes, He toyes, he kisses, wrath doth checke His childish snaring charmes, Against her will Her eies distill, She (mou'd with pitty) mourn'd, But when on me Shee set her eie, Her teares to traitors turn'd. See I my sister thus defilde? And toy I with the traitors childe? Doth he with prating sport, And sits shee silent? cals he dame, And cannot she her sister name, Distressed in such sort? First let him die; I gaue him breath, And what hath he deseru'd? His sire gaue what is worse then death, Should his seede be preseru'd? What, shall she grieue? And shall he liue Still to vpbraid our shame? Ile not dispense With such offence For a kinde mothers name. Thus reason'd she, thus wrath preuail'd, A Parents part in pitie fail'd, Sister she prou'd too deare, Rudely the tender boy she hales, Who flatteringly, kinde mother cals, Her fury made him feare: Remorse and pitie from her fled, Fell furie tooke the place; Shee in his bosome bath'd a blade, As he would her imbrace; Nor so content, Shee cut, and rent Him peece-meale, part she boiles, Some part she roasts, And thereof boasts, Blithe of her proper spoiles. Shee hereof makes a daintie feast For him that it suspected least, Her husband shee inuites, Faining the custome did permit But one man at the most, to sit At Bacchus blissed rites: He set in state, that food before Him plac'd, thereon he feeds, Too deare a dish he doth deuoure, Yet nothing thereof dreads: He saies bring here My darling deare, Irys my loued lad: Progne could nought More hide her thought, Reuenge made her so glad. Thou seest him (saies she) where (he said) I that no more could hide his head Which quietly I kept, As it was stain'd with barkned blood, Did hurle at him; as he were wood, He from the table leapt; He wailes, he weeps, he mad doth run, Full fraught with furies fits, My infants herse, his tombe, vndone I am, bereft of wits, (He said) o're-ioy'd To see him noy'd We were; Reuenge did smile, With naked blade He doth inuade Vs, authours of this guile. He eagerly doth vs persue So swift, as feathered we flew, Thereto inforc'd by feare, Soft pens sprout out, our armes turne wings, New shape we take (who'l trust such things) Soft plumes our bodies beare: We become birds, Progne to towne Doth take a sudden flight, I wandring to the woods did bowne To waile my woes by night: Some bloody staine We still retaine, The marke of that misdeed, Such crimson-taint Our feathers paint, As they seeme still to bleed. Nor he who vs persu'd doth scape For his foule fault, he looseth shape, He to a Tewghet turnes; His blade is turn'd into a bill To exercise his angry will: His voice still sadly mournes. 'Cause once a King, a crowne-like crest He brauely yet doth beare; His issue hatch'd, away doe haste, Their father they doe feare. Pandion heard These newes and bard All comfort, fed on care, Before his day Griefe made a way To death, by dire despaire. So farre sweet Philomela sung, But here sad sorrow staid her tongue, Her throbbing brest did bound, Whereby I well might guesse her griefe, And 'cause I could not yeeld releefe, Her woe my heart did wound. Pittie with passion so me pierc'd, I prest her how to please, Her legend if it were rehears'd, I deem'd would doe her ease: Not knowing well How she could tell Her tale so well agen, Returning backe I was not slacke, Thus her complaint to pen. FINIS. SHERETINE and MARIANA. TO THE TRVLIE HONOVRABLE AND NOBLE LADY Lvcie COVNTESSE OF Bedford. SHERETINE and MARIANA. The First Canto. The Argvment. Marian's Ghost her birth doth tell, How Sheretine her lou'd: And how requited; how both grieu'd When he to warre remou'd. One Euening 'twas when the declining Sunne Wearied, gaue place to the ensuing night: And siluer PhÅbe had her course begun To cheere the world with her more feeble light: To rest my selfe vpon a bed I cast, Till gentle sleepe seas'd on me at the last. As soone as sleepe me wholly had possest, And bid sad cares a time for to depart, I thought to me a louely-Maid addrest, Whose sight might pierce the most obdurate heart: Soft was her gate, and heauy was her cheare, Ghostly, yet milde, her visage did appeare. Her golden tramells trailed downe her backe, And in her hand a goarie knife she bare: Downe from her breast streamed a bloody tracke; A sable Sarsenet was all that she ware, Thorow which that blood appear'd, as I on lawne Haue seene with crimson silke a currant drawne. Then gently did she by the hand me take, Saying, Feare not, with me vouchsafe to goe, Euen for thine onely Saint faire CÅlia's sake, Where thou shalt all my forepast fortunes know: Then to a floorie greene she forth me led, Which was in Flora's finest liuery clad. The Sunne nor Moone there neuer show their face, Nor yet doth horrid darknesse there appeare; Nor nights, nor dayes, nor seasons there take place, One night, one day, one season serues the yeere. Such light as when the early Larke doth sing, Such season as twixt Summer and the Spring. Downe by this field there runnes a deepe blacke lake, O're which a Ferry-man doth steare a Boat So smeard with blood, that doubtfull it doth make, Or blacke or red, with goary pitched coat, With twisted long blacke haire, and blew lips side, Lampe-burning eies, mare-browes, &amp; nostrils wide. To him there flock'd of euery sort and fashion, Ouer that riuer waftage for to haue; But he deuoid of all loue and compassion, Would none transport, but such as pasport gaue: Here would she faine haue past, but backe he held Her with his Pole, and churlishly repel'd. Then backe she brought me to that floury greene, And set me downe, then pittifully said, Thou seest how faine I would transported beene; But churlish Charon hath my passage staid: Nor ere can I passe o're this grisly lake, Vnlesse thou daine pittie on me to take. For still I'm stayd till one doe write my story, Whose infant Muse is by a maid inspir'd, To write her worth, and to set forth her glory, Who for her parts deserues to be admir'd; Such is thy fairest CÅlia, such the Muse Which her rare beautie bred and did infuse. By thy sweet CÅlia's name I thee coniure, My ruefull legend that thou wouldst relate, This may from her some pittie thee procure, For as hers now, such once was my estate: I bid her say, and I would doe my best To please my mistresse, and procure her rest. Then thus. At Vien first I drew my breath, And at my birth I Marian was nam'd, I at Uienna gaue my selfe my death, For that alone not worthy to be blam'd; My parents had not base, nor noble blood, But betwixt both in a meane order stood. At my wretch'd birth appear'd no ominous starre, Which might my future misery diuine; None opposite, they all according were To shew my rise, but not my sad decline: All did agree to grace my infant yeares With happinesse, but drowne mine age in teares. Kind Nature freely her best gifts bestow'd, And all the Graces ioyn'd to doe me grace: In giuing what they gaue, they nothing ow'd, Which well to those appeard, who saw my face; There was no maid who durst with me compare, My beautie and my vertues were so rare. My Parents plac'd in me their whole content, I was their ioy, they had no children more, Kinne and acquaintance all of me did vaunt, And brag'd to see my youth produce such store Of budding blossomes, fairest fruit presaging, All which were nip'd by aduerse fortunes raging. My Parents care was chiefly how to traine Me vp in vertue from my tender yeeres, They vs'd all meanes, sparing nor cost, nor paine, Nor day, nor night me to instruct forbeares, So in short time my vertue had such growth, As age whiles brings, but is not seene in youth. Like as the rising Sunne with weaker light, Steales from the bed of bashfull blushing Morne, Permitting freely to the feeblest sight Him to behold, but such beames him adorne Mounting our height, as who him then beholds, Is blinded, with the brightnesse him infolds. So I an Infant at the first appearance, With hoped beautie did but weakely shine; But as in yeeres I further did aduance, Perfections Pencill so did me refine, As my accomplisht beautie at the height Dazled the bold beholders daring-sight. About this time th' Hungarian state distrest, (King Iohn being dead) by ciuill discord torne, Some Ferdinand would in the state inuest, The Frier for young Stephen others doth suborne; He with Queene Isabel calls in the Turke, Who seems her friend, but for himself doth work. Buda by sieging-Ferdinand is girt, By Solyman his Armie's there defeat; Who taketh Pesthe, Mustafa doth hurt, On Malliat warres: The Transiluanian state Sweares homage vnto Stephen; Malliat betrayd To Stambol's sent, where till he dyed he stayd. Solyman hauing Ferdinand o'rethrowne, To Buda comes; depriues the woefull Queene Of Hungary, seazing it as his owne: Sends her distressed with her Infant Stephen To Transiluania with the craftie Friar Her coadiutor, for to gouerne there. You easily may guesse her heart was sorry, Being depriu'd of what she held most deare: Rob'd of her state, degraded of her glory By th' iniust Lord shee cald to free her feare: Buda beares witnesse of her sad complaint, Which mine owne woe permits me not to paint. To Transiluania come, no sorrow ceaseth, Th' ambitious Bishop gouerns as him listeth: The Queene he curbs, command in her decreaseth, Whilst he growes greater and in pride persisteth: Till her abused patience cannot beare More the demeanor of the saucy Frier. Her Father Sigismond no comfort sends her, He was but carelesse, though she thus was crost: Not one of his confederates befriends her, Seeing him leaue her should releeue her most. Ah wretched Queen, what help can moaning make thee, When father, friends, kin, and allies forsake thee? Her sorrowes now she can no more support, (Yet peremptory George was greatest griefe:) Since who should loue, had left her in such sort, Her discontented mind hopes small releefe: To Solyman she sends; O woefull wight, To seeke an iniurer to doe thee right. The Turke commiserats her sad estate, George knowing this, to Sassebess retires, Scoures ditches, hightens wals debas'd of late, Layes in munition that a siege requires: Then rayseth forces. Isabell prouides Force 'gainst his force, which the whole land diuides. The Turke Chiauss in Isbels fauour sent Threatens the Frier, and those to him adhere; Which did no good but ill, it from her rent Most part of those that erst her fautors were: Such inbred hatred to the Turke they bore, They hate her cause, 'cause hee would her restore. The Queene (misdoubting of the Turks supply) Seekes an agreement, which is lightly granted: For the Frier knew that the Turks force drew nye, Intelligence there to her hurt she wanted: Agreed, the Frier forceth the Turke retire, Still misregards her, still doth high aspire. She once againe the Nobles doth incite, (Disdaining his neglect) and they once more In a firme league to her doe reunite, The crafty Frier thinkes to prouide therefore: To Ferdinand he sends, his aide doth proffer, Which Ferdinand accepts, glad of that offer. To Charles the Fift his brother he doth send, In such affaire to haue his present aid, Yet knowing no great succour he could lend, (In Germany his whole force being staid:) Yet at the least an expert Captaine braue For his Lieutenant he doth presse to haue. Charles weighing what this enterprise importeth, Iohn Baptist Castald, Count of Piaden Doth single out, and to this charge exhorteth, He willingly accepts, but with few men He takes his leaue, and vnto Vien comes, Where he is welcom'd with the pressing-drums. One of his traine, (and what concernes me most, With that she sigh'd) was one in Uien borne, Iohn Sheretine, his kin of him did boast, As if his stocke he chiefly did adorne. And those who haue no int'rest in his blood, Honor him more, the more hee's vnderstood. From Natiue home he long time had remain'd, In Padua ten yeares at schoole he staid, And in that time he so much learning gain'd, As Vertues firme foundations sure were laid: His father hereof knowing, him commends To Castald, who on bloody Mars attends. He willingly his fathers hest obeyes, And in short time made to the world appeare That learning ne're the haughty spirit allayes, Which honor'd glory for his badge doth beare. And though that Enuie stil doth hate braue deeds, Yet his worth euen in Enuy liking breeds. He with Castalde to Vien comes backe, Where hungrie expectation longs to see him, Kin and acquaintance to the Casements make, They thinke him happiest that first can eie him: Yet when they see, they know not whom t'affect, All-changing Time had alter'd his aspect. To see these soldiers in the Towne receiued, The confus'd multitude in clusters throng: The better sort, (yet noueltie that craued) In spatious windowes ranged were along; There was I plac'd, I clothed was in greene, Imbrodered o're with flowres like S?mers Queen. As each did passe, he did our censure passe, Whom one did like, another did disdaine: Sheretine came, and none knew what he was, Yet each one's approbation he did gaine, Each one him prais'd, and I amongst the rest, Of all that pass'd said he deserued best. Nor was this fauour forced from affection, It was desert that drew this verdict fra me, Loue had not then inflam'd me with infection, No obiect had had hap from me to draw me; Though loue had found me fit to shew his power, Yet did I liue at libertie that houre. Though mine eies were the arcenat where he hid His choisest armes, from whence he might take fires, (Which in continuall lightning from them slid) To kindle in cold hearts most hot desires; Yet I not knowing what their power meant, My youths sweet spring, free from disquiet spent. Some noble thought possessing still my minde, Whilst gold on Canuas ground my fingers place, Or nimbly on a Lute light notes out finde, Which with sweet airs my charming voice did grace: These gaue no leaue to Loue to let mine ease, Which disrespect did the Loue-god displease. He languish'd that the flames which in mine eies Were plac'd, had yet but darted feeble raies: Now did the bruit of Sheretine him please, Of him all speake, all listen to his praise; He thinkes him only worthy of those fires Which had not kindled others deepe desires. Whilst at Vienna they for dispatch stay, They're visit'd by their countrie gallantrie, Which to expresse affection doth assaie: They with requitall quit their curtesie; For Sheretine the Fates doe lay a traine, My father wooes, he may him entertaine. He willing to his suit doth condescend, To be eie-witnesse (to his house resorted) Whether that Fame me falsly did commend, Or if I were such as I was reported: For she had blaz'd my beautie euery where, Cal'd others faire and fairer, me most faire. The day did seeme to breake euen at the noone, My comming so eclips'd the former light, Small starres are dim'd so, by a rounded Moone Which from a cloud comes suddenly to sight: My beautie blaz'd so at the first appearing, He thinkes Report my worth had wrong'd by bearing. What learned Padua could not effect, Nor spacious Germanie where he had staid, That Uien doth, one beautie there respect Bred, which all theirs conioyn'd in vaine assaid: His heart from their attracting baits left free, At Uien he doth offer vp to me. My father his affection to expresse, Bids him kinde welcome as his dearest friend, Vowes lasting loue, meane-while Loue doth addresse His surest shaft, his golden bow doth bend; Mine eie the quiuer whence he tooke the dart With vnauoiding stroke, that hit his heart. One might haue seene mid-day of his desires, Euen from the East of their new taken birth: He stroue to hide the new flame of his fires, But grounded passion is not masqu'd with mirth: His mirth to melancholy sighs redoubled, Did well bewray, his musing minde was troubled. Thus was he first enamoured, yet he stroue To hide his passion; but we did perceaue Some vnaccustom'd accident did moue These sudden fits, yet we no cause would craue: He takes his leaue, vnto his home returnes, Whilst in his heart, that new fire hotly burnes. He carelesse casts himselfe vpon his bed, And 'gins to reason with his restlesse Thought: He curseth Chance that first him thither led, He strait doth blesse it 'cause it there him brought, He blames it for the breeding his vnrest, Loues it for shewing what could make him blest. How did I liue with vnperturbed minde, Passing the day with ioy, the night with sleepe, (Saith he) where wakrise cares I now doe finde, And new disquiet for my late delight: Are these th' effects of Beautie and of Loue? Heauen Loue and Beautie fra me then remoue. Ah hatefull tongue recant this foule amisse, Loue is the God that first gaue life a being: Beautie's the breeder of this greater blisse, How dar'st thou then profane their power weying? Beauty breeds loue, loue beauty doth requite With the attractiue lines of sweet delight. Then welcome Loue, I now will entertaine thee, Beauty Ile thee with reuerence adore; But what if beautious-loue should now disdaine me, Since loue and beauty I haue brau'd before? Nay, they will not take that as a disgrace, I saw nor knew not them, till first her face. Her face where wanton loue keepes residence, He takes no progresse but when she remoues: Beauty proiects from thence vnto the sence Such beaming-glances, as their brightnesse proues Yong Eaglets, pardon Loue, for I had beene Sooner your subiect, if she sooner seene. Thus passed he the night withouten slumber, Longing for day, nor did I take such rest As theretofore, new thoughts gan me to cumber, Making me wakrife whil'st my sleepe decreast. Nor could I thinke what did procure that change, 'Cause vnaccustom'd I did hold it strange. Whilst sleepe remou'd, on Sheretine I thought, (The mind must still be busied) I his shape Did thinke that Nature curiously had wrought, On which the Graces did their blessings heape; And Vertue that she part of him might claime, Had deck'd with rarest ornaments his frame. Why should I thinke on him more then another (I say:) And straight begin my thought to blame, I would forget his shape, his Vertues smother, Place where he sate, the time he went and came: Yet still the more I wish him out of mind, Him liuelier represented there I find. I sleepelesse spend the night, I early rise, He restlesse longeth for to leaue his bed, Eu'n then our thoughts began to sympathize; Abroad he walk'd as Morne the East-heauen clad: To put him out of mind I did repaire T'a Garden, yet in thought I found him there. Ere noone he came (acquaintance loth to lose) To visit and giue thankes; I ioy'd to see him, As he to be with me of all did choose; So I was well contented to be nye him: Thus did the Destinies draw on our fate, I knew not Loue, fear'd not his hidden bait. After we often walk'd into the fields, Passing the time with sport and harmlesse mirth, Where nought did want, that fairest Flora yeelds, Or Tellus from her treasure bringeth forth: But discontented mindes seld finde releefe By outward shew for inward hidden greefe. For in his countenance we might behold Some hidden grief, though gilded o're with gladnes, Sudden abortiue sighes vnto vs told; His pensiue minde was seiz'd with inward sadnesse; Ignorant of the cause, I thought to please him, The more I cherish'd, more I did disease him. Sheretines loue still more and more increast, The more he did my company frequent: His beating brest bewraid his hearts vnrest, Yet could not (though he stroue) my sight absent. So doth Farfalla dallie with the flame, Till his wings seard, he sinkes downe in the same. Oft would he striue to looke another way, And still endeuour'd, me for to neglect: Yet did his eie more stedfast on me stay, Endeu'ring to dislike bred more respect. Now look'd he pale, now red, cold, straight in fire, Merrie, soone sad; how changing is desire! Yet his desire he stroue to couer still, And each way to conceale his passion tride, But loue resisted, like a close pent kill Most hotly burnes, when least the flame's espide, He thought it would haue kild it to conceale it, The salue hurt most, which most he thought should heale it. Within short time his hid fire out doth blaze, His strength no longer able to suppresse it: He wooes Occasion, then blames her she staies To fit him Time when he might well expresse it: Time soone befriends, we to a garden walke, Vnseene, vnheard, where we might freely talke. How comes it sir, taking him by the hand, Then said I, that griefe taketh on you seisure: (Without presumption if I might demand,) Where nothing is intended but your pleasure: For in your visage Care's Idea's plac'd, Which hath your late-ioy-semblance clean defac'd. Loue-worthiest Maiden, blamelesse if I durst (Saith he) lay ope my heart and thought reueale, I would tell how my sobbing-sighs were first Conceiu'd, tooke birth, and why they still doe dwell. Then finding me willing to heare inclinde, He thus begins to tell his troubled minde. Faire (if that faire be not too base a name For thee sweet deitie of my affection,) Before this boldnesse receiue check, or blame, (My tongue is free from flatterie's infection:) Vouchsafe to heare, (and heare without offence) My rude, yet loue-inforced eloquence. Loue now the sole commander o're my soule, Else-where that could not by his craft or might Captiue my thought, or liberty controule, Hath brought me here (vsing that cunning slight) To see thy face, which in an houre hath gain'd Loue conquest o're him, who erst loue disdain'd. 'Gainst his assaults, hitherto as defence, A constant resolution I prepar'd: His beautie-batteries poorely beat my sense, Beautie's-neglect 'bout me kept watch and ward. Nere could loue gaine, till thy commanding-look Surpris'd my fort and guard, me captiue tooke. I am thy prisoner, but no freedome seeke, In this captiuitie I ioy to bide, Only I craue my hearts keeper be meeke; Deare, let not this desire be me deni'de: For it's my ioy, since Loue doth conquer all, That I had hap to be thy beauties thrall. And thy sweet looke (if I doe right diuine) Doth promise, thou wilt not so cruell proue, Nor pittilesse to make thy captiue pine By base disdaine, and so requite his loue, Which is not touched with least part of folly, My aime is honest, my pretension's holy. Then deare, (but dearer far if thou wer't mine,) Let pittie (the companion of sweet beautie,) Moue thee to loue him, whom loue hath made thine: Loue to requite with loue is but loue's dutie. Grant loue; if not, say thou scorn'st my desires, That death may quickly quench my louing fires. As doth a prisoner at the barre expect With pittie-mouing-looke the doubtfull doome, And by the Iudges more seuere aspect, Doth rather feare then hope what is to come: So Sheretine torne betwixt hope and feare, His ioy or sorrow so awaits to heare. A purple blush with natiue tincture, di'de My cheeke's late lilly in a deepest red, Whil'st I (abashed) to his speech repli'de, Whose fainting eies still on my face doe feed: I was amaz'd, I mused what to say, Loue seekes consent, modesty bids denie. At last braue sir (said I) I am not train'd So in loues schoole as make a quaint replie, Nor thinke I Louers can be so much pain'd As they make shew, but thereby only trie Their wit on womans weaknesse, to insnare That harmlesse sex before it be aware. Or if they be, it's by some rarer beautie, My poore perfection cannot passion moue, Your courage should propose elsewhere that dutie; Vaine-glore cannot so puffe me with selfe-loue As to beleeue mine such; the lookes I scatter Are feeble, ne're inflame, nor such I'le flatter. My speech (saith he) of flatterie commeth not, Loue brings it from the oracle of truth: I cannot flatter I, nor faine God wot, Nor doth it need where beautie hath such growth: With cunning I would not compassion moue, Nor trie my wit with an imagin'd-loue. My protestations whence they doe proceed, Will soone be seene by sighing out my breath, Vnlesse my martyrdome thy mercy meed, Thou'lt know thy beauti's force by timelesse-death: Then shall you see character'd on my heart True holy loue, not flatterie nor art. I must not enter in intelligence Of such loue passion (gentle sir) I said, If I haue answer'd (prompt with innocence) Seeke not the rather to intrap a maid. Th' accesse which my simplicitie doth giue, Hence I will barre, vnlesse such suit you leaue. My fathers comming hindered his replie, With him the res'due of the day he spent, Then to his chamber went, there downe did lie, Bathing his bed with teares of discontent; Accompani'd with euery kinde of care He tumbling lay, Hope yeelding to Despaire. My minde no lesse then his was sore perplex'd, It grieu'd me that I granted not his suit: It vex'd my heart to know that he was vex'd, I reason'd, and my reason did confute. Should I haue yeelded? no, who soone are won, Are soone disdain'd, then I had beene vndone. Yet who doth loue, and can torment her louer: Yeeld then, vnas'kd? may be he'le sue no more. Alas, how shall I then my loue discouer? O! would to God I granted had before. His loue's extreme; if it kill, or take flight, Or turne to hate, then all my ioyes goodnight. May be it was not serious that he said, O! I am lost if that he only tri'd me; Then my owne selfe I seriously suruai'd, And saw that louing Nature nought deni'd me: Yet pris'd I not my parts, 'cause they were rare, But 'cause they could my Sheretine insnare. Yet being doubtfull of his backe returning, I call my selfe too cruell, too vnkinde: And he that could not hinder inward mourning, Absents not long, returnes to know my minde. He vowes, protests, thereto addes sighes &amp; teares, Which sweeter then sweet'st musick pierc'd mine eares. I was well pleased that he came againe, (But better farre his loue was not decai'd) I thought it folly longer to detaine With doubtfull-Hope, lest Loue should die denai'd: I (seeming loth) granted all that he crau'd, Mine honour and my reputation sau'd. Those who haue felt the fits of feruent Loue, Which hath the strength decai'd, and vigor wasted With strongest Passion, and in end did moue Their Saint to pittie, and some comfort tasted: Such and none else, can tell if he were glad, When of my loue, this ouerture I made. My hands he kisses, doth not speake a word, (Ioy chaining fast the passage of his speech) His gesture did more eloquence afford By mouing signes, then Rethoricke can teach: Therewith o'recome, I open laid my heart, And all my louing-secrets did impart. I told him that I did no lesse affect His vertuous parts, then he admired mine, How I delai'd not 'cause I did neglect, Or ioy'd to see him for my sake to pine: But only loues continuance did doubt, The soonest kindled fire goes soonest out. No more we then on ceremonie stand, Each vnto other firmely plighteth troth, In signe whereof I tooke his, gaue my hand, Cal'd God to witnesse with religious oath: He vnto me vow'd a ne're-bating-loue, I vow'd my fancie nere should other proue. Our next care was, to gaine our friends consent, Who heard no sooner we did other like, But they did yeeld, and are so well content, They ioy and thanke the heauens, that so did strike Our hearts with equall heat, they hop'd to see Honour and ioy of our wish'd-progenie. We sometimes after walk'd to take the aire, Sometimes to see them hunt the fearfull Roe: Sometimes we to the Temple did repaire: Sometimes to the Theatre we would goe. Thus did we banquet still with fresh varietie, Yet ne're did cloy or surfet with satietie. Me thinkes the sweet remembrance yet me glads, How in my fathers flore-perfumed-garth, Where leauie tops chequer'd out motly shades, And Flora's minions diaperd the earth: How we haue walk'd discoursing of our loue, With kindest appellations Deare and Doue. An Arbor there fenc'd from the southerne Sun With honysuckle, thorne, and smelling brier, Which intermix'd through others quaintly run, Oft hath had hap our louing layes to heare: There hath he laid his head downe in my lap To heare me sing, faining to steale a nap. There sitting once, I told him how I dream'd (And wish'd my dreame were true) he l?g'd to know it: And then most eager for to heare it, seem'd; Yet shamefastnesse would neuer let me show it Before our plighted-faith; then I it read, It was how I was first inamoured. There haue we talk'd, chaste kisses interrupping Our kinde discourse, which euery word did point: I from his lips, he from mine Nectar supping Mix'd teares of Pittie oft our cheeks annoint: There haue we spent long time in such like sport, And that long time, we still thought very short. Such happinesse we had, we none envi'de, We counted Keasars catises match'd with vs: But permanent-felicitie's denide To mortalls here, none can inioy that blisse, Our ioy soone turnes to sorrow, we must part, Which with griefes sharpest prickles pierc'd each heart. Now Ferdinand had euery thing prepar'd Was necessarie the war to maintaine: Castalde who for conduct thereof car'd, Was readie, and gaue warning to his traine To be in readinesse him to attend To Hungarie to make their valour kend. Young Sheretine prepareth for to goe, Though all his friends perswade him stay behinde, Yet he will forward, though euen I say no: Sweet (saith he) Loue doth not debase the minde. What shall I now obscure my former worth? No, no, thy loue doth no such fruit bring forth. Weepe not (for then the teares stood in mine eye) Life of my Life, for so my sorrowe's doubled, Although thereby signes of thy loue I see Which it assureth, yet therewith I'me troubled: If thou wouldst haue me to inioy content, Leaue dearest Loue with sorrow to lament. The haplesse-day being come that must vs sunder, All such perswasions he powr'd out in vaine, That my heart broke not then it was a wonder, Swift scalding teares out o're my cheekes did raine, What wilt thou go? &amp; meanst thou thus to leaue me? (Said I) And wilt thou of all blisse bereaue me? Thou saydst thou wouldst my Prisoner abide, Is this thy craft thy Keeper to betray? What wilt thou cruell now my soule diuide? I know thou wouldst not kill me, Deare then stay; Ah wilt thou goe? and must I stay behind? O! Is this Loue? Is this it to be kind? No more could Passion suffer me produce, To whom my grieuing Sheretine reply'd, Each eye a teare-euacuating-Sluce; My Heart, my All, my Star that doth the guide, Leaue now to grieue, my chiefest care shall be Soone to returne, then still to stay with thee. Nor meane I now to leaue thee altogether, (With its Affection) I leaue thee my Heart, Let Destiny or Fortune draw me whither They will, yet from thee that shall neuer part: In nought I'le ioy depriued of thy sight, Except the minding of thee breed delight. Deare, let the hope of a soone ioyfull meeting, Better to beare this separation moue Thee, Thinke of the Ioyes that will be at our meeting, The Fates do force my absence but to proue Thee: Hence from my thought all else shall be debar'd: (I said) My constancy may chance be heard. Passion no more permits, we did imbrace Each other wringing in our winding armes, With mixed teares bedeawing others face, One's heart the other's rouz'd with loue-alarmes, O! none but such as haue felt like distresse, Can thinke how sorrowfull this seuering was I thinke Ulysses (faining to be mad, Loth to depart from lou'd Penelope) No such distracting fits (through fancy) had, As had my Sheretine going away; Ulysses had reaped the longed crop, Sheretine in the blade had blooming-hope. Thus did we part, he with Castalde goes; Yet while in sight he still did looke behinde him, I stay'd, steeping mine eyes in seas of woes: Oft vnawares I look'd about to finde him: Imagination did delude my sense, I thought I saw him, who was farre from thence. The Second Canto. The Argvment. Tvrian Mariana loues, Shee's forced by her Friends To marrie him: This lucklesse match With blood and sorrow ends. Of all the Passions which perturbe the minde, Loue is the strongest, and molests it most; Loue neuer leaues it as it doth it finde, By it some goodnesse is or got, or lost: None yet ere lou'd, and liu'd in like estate, But did to Vertue adde, or from it bare. Sometimes it makes a wiseman weakely dote, And makes the wariest sometimes to be wilde; Sometimes it makes a wiseman of a sot, Sometimes it makes a sauage to be milde: It maketh Mirth to turne to sullen-Sadnesse, And setled braines it often cracks with Madnesse. By cursed All-suspecting-Iealousie, Faint-doubtfull-Hope, and euer-shaking-Feare, (Whom Pale-fac'd-Care still keepeth company) It is attended: These companions are No minutes rest who let the louer find, But with their seuerall thoughts doe racke his mind. So was't with me: I euery thing did feare That might vnto my Sheretine befall; Sometimes I thought I clattring-Armes did heare, Sometimes for helpe I thought I heard him call: Sometimes I fear'd New-beautie him allur'd, Sometimes my Hope his Honesty assur'd. Now (absent) I did loue him more intearely, It taught me depriuation was a hell, The parting pangs did touch my heart but nearely; But now in Centre of the same they dwell: I oftentimes lou'd to consult with Hope, And of his swift-returne propos'd the scope. But now the Fates with Fortune doe conspire, To crosse the kinde intendements of Loue; And with salt teares to quench his kindled fire, Not satisfied with my deare Friends remoue: My Ioyes are in the waine, daily grow lesse, My Sorrows waxing, daily doe increase. To Vien backe comes Maximilian, (King of Bohemia) Ferdinand his sonne, With Mary daughter vnto Charles of Spaine, In honour whereof diuers sports are done; Tilting and Turnay, Feasts to entertaine (With pompe) the comming-stranger they ordain. 'Mongst others who to Vien then resorted, Nicholas Turian (a braue youth) was one; Most of his friends him from the feast dehorted, Yet he from it will be detain'd by none: Such warnings oft the Vnknowne-Fate forerunne, Yet misconceiu'd, by those must be vndone. His straving-eyes which wandred euery way, (Mongst the rare beauties that assembly bred) Seeking fit subiect their rouing to stay, At last vnto my firing-lookes were led; Which with one glance (that Cupid fra them prest) Dazel'd his sight, and did his eyes arrest. He thinkes he ne're such Fairenesse saw beforne, It did eclipse the beautie that was by, As doth the fresh-forth-streaming ruddie Morne Put out the lesser-lights of Nighted-skie, He thinkes there is not any of such prize, If inward worth doe outward equalize. He longs to know, and presseth to be neere, The neerer he his courage did abase: Approch'd he speaks not, seems to quake for Feare, He shames so to be danted in that place: Shame him in courag'd, prick'd him on to proue, The more my minde was knowne, it more did moue. I thought not Lady (said he) if in one The rarest Beauties of the world had beene By Nature plac'd, that that one could haue showne So great Perfection as in you is seene: Whose lustre doth exceed each beautie else, As liuely Diamond dull glasse excels. The Beautie which you speake of (I replie) Is pale, but by reflex is fairer made: If it receiu'd not light by those are by, It should be vailed with an obscure shade. Some time thus spent in talke he doth depart, Leauing his freedome with a fettered heart. Then home he goes with new-bred-thoughts turmoiling The late-sweet-quiet of his beating brains: His heauing heart with bitter anguish boiling, He Loue with his effects now entertaines: He's pensiue, musing, company absents, With frequent sighes his smoldred-fire forth vents. One of my fathers kindred very neere, (In whom much trust my parents did repose.) True friendship did to Turian in deare, Secrets were common, he by grieuing shoes Perceiues his friends distresse, demands the cause: Turian tels all compeld by Friendship's lawes. My kinsman told him who, and how I was To Sheretine by solemne oath contracted. No sooner Turian heard but cries alas, (By louing frenezie well-nie distracted:) Now see I (said he) that the Fates pretend To bring my wretched life to wofull end. My cousen was astonish'd that to heare, Knowing how hard the enterprise would be To vndoe what was done, wils him forbeare, Instantly vrges it letting him see The stopping lets, which would his loue disturbe, Therefore whiles young, he wishes it to curbe. But he (whom no disswasiue-argument From that resolue had force for to withdraw) Vnwilling heares, to goe on still is bent, Though likelihood of no good end he saw. In things difficult (saith he) worth is showne, By light atchiuements courage is not knowne. His friend (whose oratorie was in vaine) Doth condescend to aid him to his power: He vowes to lose his life, or to obtaine Helpe for the ill that did his friend deuoure: Hence my mishap, hence had my griefe first breeding, Hence my successiue-sorrowes still had feeding. No more I afterward in publike goe, (Loth to bewray my Beautie to his eies:) I shun all that might trouble or o'rethroe The order I propos'd to eternize My constant-loue, vnto the Loue that hath My Hand, my Heart, Affection and my Faith. He cannot brooke delay, spurres on his friend To know the issue, Danger's in deferring: Though it proue bad, yet best to know the end, Protraction is the worst of all loue-erring: To know the worst of ill is some releefe, Faint Hope, and feuerish feare are food for griefe. The agent (that his cause had vndertaken) Doth first addresse himselfe vnto my mother: He thinkes if that weake forteresse were shaken, He with assurance may assaile another: With doubtfull speeches he doth trie her minde, Meaning to prosecute, as she's incli'nde. He him commends, with best praise tongue affords, (Yet in no commendation did belie him.) He had Youth, beautie, vertue, winning-words, Behauiour from Detracting-hate to free him: So well he mou'd, my mother was content, Turian (if't pleas'd him) should her house frequ?t. He seekes no more, goes, tels his friend, who's glad, So soone he looked not for free accesse: No more he can forbeare; he came, did shade His deepe Desire, his Passion did suppresse: Acquainted, he comes more then Complement Requir'd, but Cunning-loue did cause inuent. He in my fathers goed Opinion growes, My mother 'gins him well for to affect: As time permits his friend his worth out throwes, With poison'd-words, he doth their eares infect: Himselfe to me imparteth still his loue, And languisheth 'cause it did nothing moue. In his pale cheeke the Lillie loseth white, The red, the rosie-liuerie off did cast: His Fauour lately that did so delight, With ardour of his hot desire did waste, In inapparant-fire he now consumes, His Beautie fades, as forward-frost-nip'd blooms. I grieue because I cannot helpe his grieuing, His paine relenting-Pittie in me bred: I doe accompt him worthy of relieuing, That he deseru'd to speed if none had sped. I blame my Beautie 'cause it breeds his woe: I cherish it 'cause Sheretine would so. His friend (perceiuing what such signes portend) Knowes if he salue not suddenly his sore, Protraction with a perfect cure must end His woes in death: he doth prouide therefore. My mother now he plainly doth assaile, And by preferment thinkes for to preuaile. Women by Nature are ambitious, With Turian's titles tickles first her eare: She of her daughters state solicitous, That Honour is her aime, doth gladly heare. He tells to her his riches and his land, And then for Wealth she more then Worth doth stand. Ah that base earth and baser excrement (Placed by Nature vnderfoot,) should moue The minde of greedy age with more content Then Liue, the life of things that's from aboue! Wealth for their Summum bonum oft is taken, Louing it most when it must be forsaken. My serpent-seduc'd-mother Eua-like, Tempts and intraps my pelfe-affecting sire: Iudge ye what pensiue pangs my soule did strike, Seeing Parents, Friends, and Furious loue conspire To work my ruine, and their power bend To prosecute my Faith, and wrong my friend. My Father with authoritie commands, My Mother with inticing blandishment Allures, for Turian my kinsman stands, With kinde perswasions, Turian doth vent With sobs and sighes his too apparant loue, All ioyne my faith and fancie to remoue. Yet I resist: my Father 'gins to rage; How now you minion must you haue your will? Becomes it you to crosse vs in our age? It is thy due our pleasure to fulfill: Is this the way for to requite the paine Which for thy education we haue tane? Thou canst ne're that repay, thou'lt still be debter, Yet still we trauell to haue thee prefer'd: Wants Turian worth? deserues He not thy better? Reforme thy selfe, acknowledge thou hast er'd. The law diuine (which you so much pretend,) Commands thee to thy parents will to bend. What though that Sheretine be gentle, free? Yet he hath left thee languishing alone: Turian is no lesse curteous then he, He flyes not from thee, giues no cause of mone. Had Sheretine but halfe so dearly lou'd, He had not from thy sight so farre remou'd. Nor are their fortunes equall: neere our friends, Is Turian's state, faire lands and signories: Sheretin's most on doubtfull warre depends, It is by others ruines he must rise: Who would such Worth with Certaintie forgoe, For Worth and Likelihood, with fairest shoe? Then foolish lasse leaue off and condescend, It is my will and I must haue it so: My mother followes on, as he doth end, Ah daughter I beseech thee by that woe, By the sore throbs I did for thee indure, Whilst yet vnborne) these sides did thee immure; By these lanke breasts at which thou oft hast hung, And locked in mine eies with childish toyes, Oft fallen asleepe whilst I haue to thee sung, Doe not now striue to stop our comming-ioyes, Who now can be more tender, wish thee better, Then she, whom Loue to such kinde worke did set her? Shalt thou the only pledge of ancient Loue, The sweet-expected comfort of mine age, That hoped happinesse fra me remoue, Which thy ne're-disobeying did presage? I know thou wilt not deare child, then incline, Scorne to be his that left for to be thine. My kinsman vrges, addes to what they said, Turian extols, detracts my Sheretine, Lessens his meanes, affirmes he is vnstai'd, Hath wand'ring-thoughts, if his Loue had not beene Quench'd: with my Beautie if he still had burn'd, He had not gone, or sooner had return'd. Turian himselfe (with teares) doth tell his woes, He needeth not protest to moue beleefe: Passion is soone perceiu'd, his outward shoes, Did well bewray great was his inward griefe, He doth not fained (for the fashion) mourne, As widowes oft, and rich heires at the vrne. Children obedience to their parents owe, I grant (said I) but in a lawfull thing; This is not, you me freely did bestow, I did submit, fra Sheretine to wring Me now were wrong, in me a foule offence: To disobey here, is obedience. Parents giue Being, noble benefit, If with't Content, if not, better vnborne: Yet euen the best doth oft-times bring with it A Miserie whereby the minde is torne, For making children capable of woe, Must they Free-choice the best of bests forgoe. Our Mindes must like, none by Atturney loueth, If Loue decay, we cannot grieue by friends: From Mariage, Loue Miserie remoueth, On Loue all wedlocks happinesse depends. 'Twixt those ne're lik'd, what hope is loue will last, When 'twixt those deareliest lou'd oft falls distaste? If Turian than he is more noble were, More vertuous, more rich, of higher degree: Sheretine more meane, more poore, lesse worthy far, Yet he hath that, that more contenteth me. It's not in vs to loue or to despise, They loue by Fate, whose soules doe simpathise. I grant his Worth is worthy of respect, Teares for his griefe, my cheeks haue often staind: Yet with that Loue I cannot him affect, Wherewith a Husband should be entertain'd. 'Twixt those who wed, if wooing loue be cold, The maried-friendship can no long time hold. Yet doe suppose I could affect him dearely, How might I with my Plighted-Faith dispence? O how my Conscience is touched neerely, Euen with the thought of such a foule offence. How can that prosper, or haue happie end, Which sinne begins, and still must God offend? For I cannot be lawfully his wife, It's not the act that ties the mariage knot, It is the Will; then must I all my life Be stained with Inchastitie's foule blot. O grant me then my choice be either free, Or an vnstained Virgin let me die. All would not doe, my father so austere Commands, and must not will not be denai'd. My mother and my kinsman will not heare; Turian still vrgeth, they must be obai'd: O heauen beare witnesse, since you force me do it, (Say I) my heart doth not consent vnto it. Thus 'gainst my will I giue my selfe away, They (glad they gained) euery thing doe hast: Fearing Disturbance by the smallest Stay, They thinke them not secure till it be past. I to my chamber goe, on bed me threw, Which my moist eies doe suddenly bedew. With these complaints I entertaine the Time: Ah must I now my Hoped-ioyes forgoe? Must Pleasure perish with me in the prime? Must I be wedded to a lasting-Woe? Must I my Setled-fancie now remoue, And leaue a lawfull for an vniust Loue? Must I recall my Promise freely giuen, And falsifie my faith vnto my Friend? Is not my Oath now registred in heauen? Is not my Promise to it's power kend? Ah, ah, it is, and therefore they decree To tie my life to lasting miserie. Ah Sheretine, if thou but now didst know In what a case thy Mariana is: How she's surpriz'd and taken by thy foe, Left comfortlesse, debarred of all blisse: Would not Relenting-pittie make thy heart To melt with sorrow for thy Sweet-loue's smart? Free from their forcing to thee shall remaine, Doe what they can, my best, most noble part, Which they shall want power and skill to gaine, Reseru'd for thee shall be my Loue, my Heart. Farwell deare loue, and as much ioy possesse, As doth thy Marian vnhappinesse. The day is come, we solemnly are wed, That part-displeasing I doe ouerpasse: You easily may thinke my heart was sad, When forced thus against my will I was. Vaine were their wishes, who did bid vs ioy; Sad griefe my nuptial-pleasure did destroy. Caslalde in Hungaria ariu'd; Agria in haste commands to fortifie, A towne of great import, but yet depriu'd Of naturall strength, or artfull industrie. There was his Rende-vous, his men there met, For Transiluania sorth by Tyss they set. They in battaillie march Tibiscus past, Till they ariue at small, weake Debrizen, While Custald with the Frier to meet doth hast, A Diet's held at Egneth by the Queene. The Frier with craft hinders her enterprise, By feare or flattery makes the Lords to rise. The Dyet thus dissolu'd, the Queenes designe Is ouerthrowne, vanisheth to smoake: To Albeiula with her sonne in fine She doth withdraw; there fearing sieging shoake, And weaknesse of the place, to Sassebess Makes her retrait, which more strong sited was. Albeiula George besiegeth strait, To take it fairely, or to throw it downe, Is bent; it kept the Queenes Iewels and plate. The Gowne, the Mantle, Scepter, Shooes &amp; Crowne. The Cannon vomiting forth fierie balls, In diuers places shakes the mouldring walls. With brauer courage then the Priest expected, The valiant-besieged did defend: To Castald letters George in haste directed, Post after post with diligence doth send, Wills him to speed, yet 'cause he saw small haste, T'accord with Isabel he thinkes it best. Ten thousand Spaniards thither to his aid Were comming (and now nye) Fame did report: Whereby the Queene was troubled, sore afraid, Accords with George to render in such sort, As she might haue her mouables of worth From Albeiula safely brought her forth. The Frier at Egneth with Castalde meets, Albeiula Dalmas being tane: With ioyfull-semblance one the other greets, Yet craft and Iealousies in heart retaine. Ferdinand's letters George chiefe guider made, Whereof th' ambitious Bishop's very glad. To Sassebess they come to finde the Queene, And there ariue at third houre of the night: Within two daies the Lords they doe conuene, They sit in counsell, Castald to their sight Shewes his Commission, wills the Queene restore That Prouince as it was agreed before. He many arg'ments to this end doth vrge, It was concluded by her late Lord Iohn: The Turke (the Christians common foe and scourge) Could not be danted with so weake a one. She held it but with trouble and vnrest, At the Turkes pleasure might be dispossest. Not only Hungary thereon depends, But the whole good of all the Christian state, Her Power weake, she wanted helpe of Friends, Vnable his incroching-force to bate: A mightie Prince was meeter him to curbe, If he the common peace durst to disturbe. To the old offers, he now addeth more, Th' Infanta Ioan to her young son Stephen With Crownes a hundred thousand to her dower, By Ferdinand should faithfully be giuen. All like this well, all willingly it heare, And send to her this message by the Frier. Whilst vnresolued, things thus doubtfull hung, She with Castald hath priuate conference: Bitterly plaineth of the Prelats wrong, Wherewith her Patience can no more dispence. Constrain'd by need, she yeelds to Ferdinand, George thereof knowing, seekes it to withstand. He thinkes if Setled-peace were surely plac'd, And all the ciuill broiles were fully ceast: His plumes were plucked, he should be disgrac'd, Who now is most, should be regarded least. Often a gold-affecting Prelate proud, For priuate ends hinders a publique good. The Queene vnto Castalde him accuseth, (Inconstancie and cunning she did doubt:) To ratifie th' agreement rather chuseth, Castalde labours how to bring't about: There is a Dyet cal'd at Colosuar, The States from all sides to it doe repare. The day come, and the Regall ornaments Produc'd, the Priest desires the Crowne in keeping: With sobs and sighs her inward sorrow vents; Scorne and Disdaine detaine her eyes from weeping: What, shall I to a base Frier giue the Crowne, Whereof I dispossest my selfe and sonne? She said. Then in her hand the Crowne she tooke, In presence of Castalde and her Sonne, And all the Lords, her eyes teares cannot brooke; In pearly torrents o're her cheekes they run. The teares which from her Sonnes eyes did distill, Shew'd the surrender was against his will. Since froward Fortune (that in change delights, Where with her ficklenesse infects the world, Hath vs subuerted loaded with despights, And all her mischiefes on our heads haue hurl'd:) Makes me this woefull resignation make, My Mates, thy Father's Kingdomes to forsake; Yet shall shee not amidst all these annoyes Let vs but that in this weele take content; Since we must leaue them, that he them inioyes Who is a Christian; Here I them present To thee Castald for Ferdinand, tell we Not by constraint, but yeeld them to thee free. Now we submit our selues vnto his Grace, With all our fortunes, humbly him intreat (Since sprung of princely blood and royall race) To take some pitie of our poore estate: Let not his bounty now denie releefe, Nor breach of promise adde vnto our griefe. And thou (sweet Iohn) my deare and tender sonne. Since now our fortune's not sufficient That to repaire, that malice hath or'ethrowne Without the aide of others: be content; Midst of such miseries, I thought it best With priuate losse to gaine a publique rest. Like to a Prince (though not like to a King) Yet thou maist liue with some good certaintie, When Destinie's disgrace on Kings do bring, There they gouerne with mutabilitie: Deare Childe, of friends, of aid, of hope forsaken, For thy repose this course is vndertaken. Yet 'mongst these troubles let vs not despaire, Nor doubt but thou art kept for more command; Thinke it not strange, nor be dismaid with care, Where thou didst first take breath to leaue that land, Loue Vertue, Vertues dignitie's so great, Fortune cannot debarre it long from state. I grant there's cause of greefe, to giue away This Crowne thy fathers temples did adorne, And if false Fortune had not put a stay, Had now vpon thy Kingly head beene worne: But now with Patience we must be content, Each state doth change, no kingdome's permanent. Thus spoke shee with such penetrating words, (And therewith did deliuer vp the Crowne) As they did pierce the hearts of all the Lords, But chiefly George, in teares his eies did drowne. Castalde with kinde words striues to appease Her sorrow, and to swage her swelling seas. Within few daies shee doth from thence depart, With painfull trauell and in habit poore, Dissembling not the anguish of her heart, Shee manifests it to her vtmost power; Towards Cassonia shee doth take the way, Where a steepe hill inforceth her to stay. The roughnesse hinders her in Coach to ride, Shee's faine with labour on her foot to goe, Her tender Childe and Ladies by her side, The only now-copartners of her woe, Whilst they'r on foot, a sudden storme doth rise, Black pitchy clouds inuelloping the skyes. The Winde and raine them boisterously did beat, Shee blameth Fortune that is not content To be her opposite in matters great, But euen in trifles, thus her spight to vent. She attributes it to her Destinie, That she is subiect to such miserie. Therefore a little for to ease her minde, Vnder a tree for shelter she tooke seat: Sic fata volunt carued in it's rinde, Regina Isabella vnder wrait. Ah wretched Queene, no wonder thou wast sorie To fall so low, from such a height of glorie. She to Cassonia comes, and beares it out With patience, till Fortunes furie's past: With Time, herrowling wheele doth come about, And she is of her countrie repossest. God grant her soone her state, and kingdome lost, Who with more courage beares it, though more crost. Castalde hauing what he would obtain'd, Lord Iohn Alphouse Castald with the Crowne He sends to Ferdinand, my Louer pain'd, With lingring-stay for Vien's ready bowne. Castalde (though vnwilling) condescends, Loth for to part at once with two such friends. In iourneying euery houre he thinketh two, The neerer, he doth thinke the leagues the longer: His loue increases, and he knowes not how The neerer to Me his Desire is stronger. Long-look'd for-Vien he beholds at last, Spur'd by Desire, he to it hasteth fast. Thinkes with himselfe, O what a ioyfull greeting Wil't be when Marian sees her Sheretine? How shall we beare our selues at this wish'd meeting? Can the ioy be exprest we shall be in? Ah Sheretine, how little didst thou know, How farre from Ioy thou wast, how neere to woe. No sooner Hee in Uien's come, but heares The sad newes of the thing he least suspected: He thinks them Mandrak-sounds, he stops his eares, He trowes each tongue with poison is infected: He none beleeues, he thinks that each tongue lies, Longing to see me, to my home he hies. He came, in Turians armes me looked found, He could not trust his eies (though still he gazed) No doubt his heart receiu'd a deadly wound, Long ere he spoke, he was so much amazed. At last, Is this the constancie (he said) Should be heard of? that spoke, no longer staid. My heart was no lesse cut with Care then his Because He staid not to heare my excuse, I know he deem'd I willing did amisse, Which did more sorrow in my soule infuse: Taking no leaue, He faire Vienna leaues, Accompany'd with Care-increasing griefes. All-woe-begone, He wanders here and there, Lookes most for rest when furthest from resort, Submits himselfe solely to sad Despaire, With cheering-comfort He cannot comport: At last He came vnto an obscure shade, Where mirthlesse Melancholy mansion had. Low on the ground grew Isope, Wormewood, Rew, The mourning mounting trees ware Cypresse green, Whose twining tops so close together grew, They all seem'd as they but one Bow had beene: Couering a spacious Tombe where cursed Care Her selfe had sepulchriz'd with dire Despaire. No wanton Bird there warbled louing layes, There was no merry Merle, Gold-Finch, or Thrush; No other hopping Bird in higher sprayes, No mourning Nightingale in lower bush: The carcasse-crauing-Rauen, Night-Crow, Owle, In this darke groue their hatefull notes did howle. This sullen seat doth sute well with his soule, There throwes himselfe downe in the bitter weeds; His heart did thrust out sighs, his tongue condole, His watring eyes with bitter moisture feeds These haplesse herbes, there 'gins he to lament, With interrupting sighs his woes to vent. Ah cursed Time (and there a sigh him staid) That e're I saw (that scarcely he had spoken When that a grone his fainting speech allayd, With such abound as if his heart had broken; When sighes and grones had got some little vent, He 'gins anew his sorrowes to lament.) Ah cursed Time (said he) that ere I saw The light, and that my Nurse did not o'rely me; Ah cursed Time that first I breath did draw, Ah cursed Time, that did not Time deny me: Ah cursed Time! Ah cruell cursed Time, That let me passe the springtide of my Prime. Was it for this I was so sung and dandled Vpon the knee, and watched when I slept? Was it for this I tenderly was handled? Was it for this I carefully was kept? Was it for this I was so neatly nurst, That I of all should be the most accurst? Did Fortune smile in my young tender yeares, To make me better relish now my paine? Then powr'd I out no bitter brinie teares, That I should now haue store my cheekes to staine? Did Fortune and the Fates striue to content me, That they might now with sorrow more torment me? Did cruell Loue yeeld vnto my Desire, To know his paine by being dispossest? And did my Marian with Loue conspire, Did all agree to rob me of my rest? Since it is Marian's will, welcome Despaire, Farwell all Ioy, welcome Woe, Griefe and Care. Welcome since it's her will, now wished Death, Long may she liue, and happie with her choice: I will wish that so long as I haue breath, Nay, euen in death I will therein reioyce. Deare (though disloyall) Thou art still to me, So once (if thou not fain'dst) I was to thee. If that one sparke of thy old loue remaine, When thou shalt chance my timelesse death to heare; Let that so much fauour for me obtaine, As offer at my hearse a sigh, and teare. And if some chance be by when them you spend, And aske the cause, say You haue lost a friend. Sorrow suffers no more, his tongue there staies, Heart-killing Care prepares to stop his breath: His strength and colour by degrees decaies, Griefe seemes to grieue, and for his help cals Death, Who much displeased so to see him languish, Soone with his surest cure doth helpe his anguish. No sooner heard I how my deare Friend di'd, (Soon it was known, for his friends had sought him:) And that his destinie was so discri'd, That to his timeles death my deeds had broght him: But that my ill-diuining haplesse-heart Was suddenly assaild with vnseene smart. Now Turian I will no more come nie, His flattering blandishments I now disdaine: He is despis'd, yet greeueth more to see The mistrisse of his soule thus seaz'd with paine: He with my sadnesse such a consort beares, Sighes as I sigh, doth weepe when I shed teares. Sad discontent so wholly me possest, I seem'd not she that late I was before: My woe that was by fits, is an vnrest Which with a still increase growes euer more. From mirthfull companie I now absent, And melancholie walkes alone frequent. Thus many dayes onely heart-killing-Griefe Me still accompany'd, and did attend With blacke Despaire, which told me no reliefe On earth could my least discontentment end: The dayes I spent in heauy plaints and monings, In night I tyre the answering-wals with gronings. Yet neuer could I sit, or walke, or lye, But still I thought I saw my Sheretine, With pale and meager face standing me by, With wrathfull looke vpbraiding me of sin, Saying his soule could yet obtaine no rest Amongst the soules in sweet Elyzium blest. Twixt Feare and Loue my heauy heart distract, Knew neither what to follow, what to flee; Loue bids me for my Sheretine to act A part that might me ease and set him free; Perswades me, and affirmes I shall remaine With my Loue after in Elyzian Plaine. Feare 'fore my face makes horrid Death appeare In vgly shape seazed with smarting paine, Making to tremble as he draweth neere; Yet I with Scorne his Terrour doe disdaine: Loue doth preuaile, I am resolu'd to flye, By death to keepe my Louer company. Thus mourning, on my bed my selfe I threw, Saying, sweet Sheretine behold and see, For thy sweet sake I bid the world adew; And now deare Loue I come to liue with Thee: Then out I drew this blood-begored knife, Therewith to cut the fatall threed of life. Thrice was my hand heau'd vp to giue the stroke, Thrice downe againe my fearefull hand did fall; Still feare disswades, and loue doth still prouoke, Courage her forces to my heart did call; Then gaue this deaths wound, whilst my latest cry Was, Sheretine, behold thy Marian dye. My Mother (with my latest scrike affrighted, Come in and finding me in such a guise) With sudden fright is lastingly benighted; Feare-forced-Death seales vp her aged eyes: My Father rages, his gray haires he tore, Turian (though still) amazed, grieued more. Puld out the blade, pans'd the bloud-weeping-wo?d, Findeth it mortall, saw my soule depart; A franticke fury did him cleane confound, He stroke himselfe on sudden to the heart; Our bloud doth mixe in death, yet mine would run From his; what life dislik'd e'ne death would shun. My Father now doth finde (though all too late,) The miserie Forc'd-mariage doth insue: Vnto the poore he giues his whole estate, The world (with his delights) he bids adue. He as a Pilgrim from Uienna goes; Where, when, or how he died, yet no man knows. Then to these fields my sad Soule did descend, With my sweet Sheretine abode to make: But when I came, I found my faithfull friend With Caron passing o're this grisly Lake: For my Death had his wronged Ghost appeas'd. So that He might passe ouer as he pleas'd. I followed fast, thinking with Him to goe, That I might still inioy his companie: But I was stai'd as I before did show Vntill thy Muse should pittie take on me: And Now by thy sweet CÃ¦lia's name once more I thee coniure, keepe promise past before. Then booke She brought me, and no longer stai'd, But with more cheerefull lookes did thence depart, With confidence she could not be denai'd What she desir'd, for her sake, hath my heart: For CÃ¦lia's sake my sole-adored-saint, The world with Marian's woes I thus acquaint. FINIS. A Happy Husband: OR DIRECTIONS FOR A MAID TO CHVSE HER MATE. Together with A WIVES BEHAVIOVR after Mariage. Exemplo junctÃ¦ tibi sint in amore columbÃ¦, Masculus &amp; totum fÅmina coniugium. Proper. TO THE VERTVOVS AND NOBLE LADY, THE Lady Margaret Home, eldest daughter to the Right Honourable Alexander Earle Home, Baron of Dunglas, &amp;c. TO WOMEN IN GENERALL. To Ouerburies Widow, wife of this Husband. Leaue worthy Wife to weare your mourning weed, Or bootlesse stain your cheeks for him that's dead; But rather ioy, and thanke this Authors pen, Hath so well match'd thee with this matchlesse man: For Ouerburies Ghost is glad to see His widow such one's happie wife to be. R. S. To his friend the Author. Thy happie Husband shewes thy high ingine, Whose muse such method in her measures can, The matter shewes thy manners are diuine; Thy practiz'd vertues shewes thou art this Man: I halfe enuie that highly blessed Maid, Whose happie lot shall be to linke with thee, And well-nie wish that Nature had me made A woman; so I such one's wife might be: Detraction is distraught thy lines to see, And sweld with enuie, can no words bring forth, Her basenesse cannot parallel thy worth, Which still shall liue vnto eternitie: For after Ages reading of thy verse, Shall decke with Lawrell thy adored herse. P. S. To his Friend M? Patricke Hannay. Friend I am glad that you haue brought to life A Husband fit for Ouerburies Wife; Whose chastitie might else suspected be, Wanting too long a Husbands companie: But now being match'd so well by your endeuour, Shee'll liue a chaste Penelope for euer. And you braue Ouerburie make to be Your brother in law by act of ingeny. W. Iewell. To the Author. When I behold the Author and his booke, With wonder and delight on both I looke; Both are so like, and both deserue so well, Were I not friend, I in their praise would dwell. But since I should seeme partiall, I thinke fit To leaue their praises to a better wit: Yet Husband like to this I wish God send To those are chaste, and to me such a friend. Liue each in other, be each others praise, Time shall not end your glorie with your daies. Edward Leuenthorpe. A HAPPY HUSBAND Or Directions for a Maide to choose her Mate The Argument. Mariage ordaind; the man made head, That kinde may be, like like doth breed: God blest it; youth it best befits: The Author will not trie his wits To make one man of manies parts, Painters doe so to shew their Arts: His birth and breeding first he showes, Equall, and good; the wants of those What ils they breed, yet selfe-gain'd glore He doth preferre both these before. His shape must not deformed be, âNature makes house and guest agree. His stature neither low, nor tall, âThe meane in each is best of all: Not curious to be counted faire, It's womanish to take that care; Free from affecting gifts of others, That selfe-weaknesse still discouers. Such one found, then next is showne What vice hee'sd want, what vertue owne; Wealth must be set aside to trie, (It is a beame in iudgements eie.) What ill doth haunt her weds for gold, Is told: with the content of old, When vertue and simplicitie Bid chuse: then he doth let her see The Worthies that the World brought forth, Woo'd ne're for wealth, but still for worth. With vertue this man should be nurst, If't be deprau'd, he's worse then first: Drunkennesse, gaming, he must want, He shewes what ils such vnthrifts haunt; He must not haunt anothers sheets, With grace, foule whoredome neuer meets; He must haue spent well his time past, A wicked crimes bruit long doth last: His humours must with hers agree, Or else true friendship cannot be; He must feare God, for on that feare Wisdome doth her building reare, It's that makes honest; Honestie In shew, not deed, is policie. He must propose a certaine end, Whereto his actions all must bend; He must haue vnfain'd pietie, And serue in truth the Deity: The foure chiefe vertues in some measure, Must hoord vp in him their treasure, Whereon the lesser doe depend, Age, and behauiour doe him end. Another. To keepe him good, his wife must be Obedient, milde, her huswifery Within doores she must tend; her charge Is that at home; his that at large: Shee must be carefull: idle wiues Vice workes on, and to some ill driues: Not toying, fond, nor yet vnkinde, Not of a weake deiected minde, Nor yet insensible of losse, Which doth with care her Husband crosse: Not iealous, but deseruing well, Not gadding, newes to know, or tell; Her conuersation with the best, In Husbands heart her thought must rest: Thus if shee chuse, thus vse her mate, He promiseth her happie state. In Paradice God Mariage first ordain'd, That lawfully kind might be so maintain'd; By it the Man is made the Womens head, And kind immortalized in their seed: For like produces like, it so should be, God blest it with Increase and multiply. Nature requires it, nothing is more iust, Who were begot, beget of duty must. It Youth becomes, Age is vnapt to breed, Old stocks are barren, youthfull plants haue seed. Then vertuous Virgin, since such blessing springs From wedlock (which earths greatest comfort brings) Compeld by loue, which to thy worth is due, How to choose well thy mate, I will thee shew, Whose sympathizing-vertues may combine Your hearts in loue, till death lifes thread vntwine. It's not my minde the rarities to gleane Of best perfections I haue heard or seene; And take the best, where bounty doth abound, And make a Husband, (no where to be found:) The Painter so from boyes, and girles did take Best of their beauties, Helen faire to make; No, I will paint thy mate in such a hew, As Care may finde: Discretion must allow. To choose aright, know from what stock he's grown; The birth suits best, is neerest to thine owne: Dislike makes higher Birth deeme lower base, Lower will neuer by thy Birth take place: In Man the fault is more to be excus'd, Who of low birth (for bÃ©auty) hath one chus'd; His lightnesse therein euer loue is deem'd, Yet as his place, his Wife shall be esteem'd. But when a Woman of a noble race Doth match with Man of farre inferiour place, Shee cannot him innoble, he is still In place as shee first found him, good, or ill: His breeding will his birth still to thee tell, âFor as the Caske, the liquor still doth smell. A Crab, though dig'd &amp; dung'd, cannot bring forth A luscious fruit; so hardly man of worth Doth from base stocke proceed: still like it selfe Nature produces; force of golden pelfe To alter that's not able, yet we know Oft Men of worth haue come of Parents low: For Parents place is not the Childrens merit, Yet it addes grace, if they their worth inherit; If not, it addes to shame: for from high race Vertue's expected due to such a place: For indegenerate heroicke mindes They should possesse, are come of noble kindes: What mans own worth acquires with virtuous ends, Is truly his, and not that which descends. Cicero brags (and iustly) that his line He did in glorious vertue farre out-shine, Which was his honour: They no honour haue, Who (idle) adde not to what they receiue; It is his owne worth euery Man doth grace, Lesse or more eminent, as is his place: For Vertue (though aye cleare) yet clearest shines When shee doth dart her lights from noble lines. A glorious flame blazing in valley low, Is soone barr'd sight, nor doth it farre way show, Obscur'd with neighbour obiects: but on hie A little Beacon to both farre and nie Shewes like a bearded Comet in the Aire, Admir'd of some, of most accounted rare. Choose thou a Husband equall to thy race, Who's grac'd by vertue, and doth vertue grace; âThings different doe neuer well agree, âTrue liking lodges in equalitie: Better then birth his Parents vertues know, âFrom poyson'd springs no wholesome waters flow. As for his shape, I would it should be free From (Natures note of spight) Deformity: Deformed shape is of so bad a nature, That it's dislik'd euen in a noble creature; Where comely shape with loue attracts the eyes, By secret sympathie of all it sees. Englands third Richard, and the wife of Shore, The one deform'd, the other grac'd with store Of bountious Natures gifts, doe shew th' effects Of Loue and Hate, to good and bad aspects; Shee (when shee bare-foot with a Taper light, Did open penance in the peoples sight) Went so demure, with such a louely face, That beauty seem'd appareld in disgrace: But most when shame summon'd the blood too hie, With natiue staines, her comely cheekes to die In scarlet tincture: Shee did so exceed, That e'en disgrace in her delight did breed; Firing beholders hearts that came to scorne her, So Beauty cloath'd in basenesse did adorne her, That e'en the good (who else the vice did blame) Thought shee deserued pitie more then shame: Condemning cunning Richards cruell minde, Who caus'd her shame, the multitude to blinde, Left it his greater mischiefe should behold, Which his ambition-plotters had in mold: So in them was the force of feature seene, Who, if lesse famous, had more happy beene. Thus Nature makes each Body with the minde Some way to keepe Decorum: for we finde Mark'd bodies, Manners crosse accompany, Which in well-shap'd we seld, or neuer see: For shee doth Builder-like a Mansion frame Fit for the guest should harbour in the same. No Stature chuse too low, for so in time Thy off-spring may proue dwarfes; yet do not clime To one too tall: for buildings mounted hie, Their vpper roomes seldome well furnish'd be: Herein obserue the meane, it's best of all, Let him not be obseru'd for low nor tall. Fresh, liuely colours, which faire women grace, Modest, effeminate, alluring face, Is not so much in Man to be respected, As other graces are to be affected: The bloome of Beauty is a fading flower, Which Age and Care consumeth euery houre: It blasted once, is euer after lost, Like to a rose nipt with vntimely frost. A manly face in Man is more commended Then a faire face from Sun and Winde defended. A Carpet Knight. who makes it his chiefe care To tricke him neatly vp, and doth not spare (Though sparing) precious time for to deuoure, (Consulting with his glasse) a tedious houre Soone flees (spent so) whiles each irregular haire His Barbor rectifies, and to seeme rare, His heat-lost-lockes to thicken closely curles, And curiously doth set his misplac'd purles; Powders, perfumes, are then profusely spent, To rectifie his natiue nasty sent: This forenoones taske perform'd, his way he takes, And chamber-practis'd crauing, cursies makes To each he meets; with cringes, and screw'd faces, (Which his too partiall glasse approu'd for graces:) Then dines, and after courts some courtly dame, Or idle busie-bout misspending game; Then suppes, then sleepes, then rises for to spend Next day as that before, as t'were the end For which he came: so womaniz'd turn'd Dame, As place 'mongst Ouids changlings he might claime; What? Doe not such discouer their weake minde (Vnapt for actiue vertue) is inclinde To superficiall things, and can imbrace But outward Habits for internall Grace. The mindes gifts doe the bodies grace adorne, Where that's defectiue, to affect is scorne: For Action's hinder'd by too much obseruing Of decency: but where a well deseruing And setled reputation is; then there Each thing becomes, and is accounted rare: Where that's defectiue, striuing to affect Anothers worth, their weakenesse doth detect. Let thy Mate be what such doe striue to seeme, Thou must the substance, not the shade esteeme: When thou hast found this well form'd cabinet, Try what rich Iewels are within it set: Set wealth apart, thou shalt more clearely see His Vertues (Riches dazell Iudgements Eye.) Who weds for wealth, she onely wealth doth wed, Not Man, which got, and in possession had, Loue languishes: yet till ones death shee's forced To liue with him; though wealth faile, yet diuorced They cannot be; so is she all his life His riches Widow (though she be his Wife.) That golden Age (when sullen Saturne raigned, For Vertues loue, (not Golds) the glory gained: To be so stil'd, it was not then demanded How rich in gold, or how that he was landed: When they did wooe, simplicitie had wont Be first, which now is last, in least account) With Vertue leading Loue, be Wedlocks ayme, And greatest wealth, a pure vnspotted name: They liu'd and lou'd, then ioying each in other, Not fearing that their Mate should loue another Seduc'd by tempting Gold; their time they spent Free from distrust, or open discontent: But the next Age, when as our mother Earth (Fertile before in voluntarie birth) Was sought into, and had her bowels torne For hidden wealth: then when the keele was worne, Plowing the Ocean for his hidden store, The sweet Content did vanish was before. The silly Maid (then ignorant of ill) Hauing no Wealth, might liue a Maiden still, And die (except seduc'd) so; the poore swaine (Though vertuous) was straight held in disdaine: But yet the Worthies that the world brought forth Since that blest Age, postponed wealth to worth; Great Alexander did disdaine the offer Declining Darius with his Child did proffer, Nor Maced's full of Gold, nor Euphrates brim, To bound his Empire, could inuegle him: But He for that rather contemn'd his Foe, For thinking He could haue beene conquer'd so. True worth doth wealth as an addition take, Defectiue vertues wants of weight to make: Vertue's best wealth, wherewith he should be nurst, That smell stayes long, a vessell seasons first. Yet build not there, for good natures depraued, Are still the worst, so thou maist be deceiued. See that he haue so spent his forepast time, That he be free from censure of a crime. Youth's apt to slip: but a notorious deed From Nature, nor from Age, doth still proceed; And though that Fortune herein oft hath part, Yet th' actions still are iudged from the heart. Adrastus thinking to reuenge the harmes Of his dead Loue, his naked weapon warmes In his brothers bosome (too deare bloud to spill) In stead of his that did his Lady kill: Fleeing to CrÅsus, he him entertain'd, Where his behauiour so much credit gain'd, As Lydia's hope, young Atis, CrÅsus heire He got in charge; whom hunting vnaware His haplesse hand vnfortunately slew, Whiles at a Boare his dismall Dart he threw: Yet was it thought intention, and not chance, Till being freely pardon'd the offence, Lest more drast'rous chances should fall out, His owne selfe-slaughter cleer'd them of that doubt: Thus when opinion hath possest the minde, It leaues a deepe impression long behinde; And they must doe much good, that haue done ill, Ere they be trusted, wer't by fate or will. See Drunkennesse (from which all vices spring) Doe no way staine him; for that still doth bring Contempt, disgrace, and shame: Cyrce made swine Of wise Vlysses fellowes, drunke with wine. The Macedonian Monarch (lately nam'd) Is not for worth so prais'd, as for that blam'd; He in his drinke destroy'd his dearest friend, That did 'fore him his Fathers deeds commend: Nor could his after-teares wash off that staine Which doth to blot his actions still remaine: For if one would his glorious actions show, How strong, chaste, valiant, milde to captiu'd foe; With such braue deeds though he the world hath fild, Yet this still stayes, He drunke, deare Clytus kild. No Gamester let him be: for such a Man Shall still be loser, doe the best he can; His mind and money it frets, and destroyes And wafts the precious time he here enioyes: Some in lesse time vnto some Art attaine, Then others spend in Play; somes pleasing vaine Will seeme so milde, in this deare double losse, They outwardly not take it for a crosse: But when all's gone (for they but then giue ouer) Their smother'd anguish they at last discouer; Whereof mans foe, the Fiend aduantage takes, Whiles on selfe-slaughter'd rockes, he gathers wrakes Examples hereof we may daily see, How some by halter, some by poyson die; And who goe not so farre, yet their last ends Contemned need, and misery attends: For this ill haunts them, who to play are bent, They seldome leaue till their estate be spent. With others sheeres let him not be acquainted, (They are still stain'd, whom once that sin hath tainted) And neuer hope to haue him true to thee, Who hath oft prei'd on chang'd varietie: Be sure who hath had choice, well ne're digest To feed on one dish, (though of sweetest taste) And who so straies, loues not, but lusts; in one Doth Loue delight, when that leaues, Loue is gone; For Grace and Lust ne're harbour in one Inne, And where Lust lodges, euer lodgeth Sinne: Which Sinne when it is to a habit growne, Not feare of God (but Man, lest it be knowne) Doth stay the execution: but be sure Though the Act be hindred, yet the hearts impure, Whose Lusts will predomine in time and place, Not ouer-rul'd by Gods preuenting Grace. Besides, he will be still suspecting thee, Though thou beest pure as spotlesse Chastitie: For vice is euer conuersant in ill, And guiltie as it selfe thinkes others still. Vpon this Earth there is no greater Hell, Then with suspecting Iealousie to dwell. See that his humors (as neere as may be) Doe with each humor of thy minde agree; Or else contention, and dissention still, Will bar your sweet content; while the ones will The others doth resist, Loue cannot be 'Twixt fire and water, they will ne're agree: True friendship must expresse 'twixt man and wife, The comfort, stay, defence, and port of life, Is perfect, when two soules are so confus'd, And plung'd together (which free-will hath chus'd) As they can neuer seuer'd be againe, But still one compound must of both remaine: From which confused mixture, ne're proceeds Words of good turnes, requitals, helpes of needs; For it is euer after but one soule, Which both their wils and actions doth controule; And cannot thanke it selfe for the owne deeds, (What is done to it selfe, no selfe-loue breeds:) But this holds not where humors disagree, There's no concordance in disparity. See he feare God, then will he feare to sinne; Where vice doth leaue, there Vertue doth begin: Sinne is nipt in the bud, when we doe minde That Gods all light, and can in darknesse finde What we can hide from Man, the reines and heart He searches through, and knowes each hidden part, And each thought long before; we cannot hide Our faults from him, nor from his censure slide. The Wiseman saith, it's Wisdomes first degree, To haue a true feare of the Deity; For that makes Honest: Honestie's commended, Whether sincere, or for a cloake pretended. The vulgar Honesty, seruant to Lawes, Customes, Religions, Hope and feare it drawes Be more or lesse: according to the times It still is wauering, difference of climes Makes it vnequall, rather Policy I may call such Respect, then Honesty; Which still aspiring, quickly oft mounts hie, And in short time vnto that marke comes nie At which it aimes: but builded on false grounds, A sudden fall it vnawares confounds. But Honesty doth alwaies goe vpright, With setled pace; not wauering for the might Of windes, times, nor occasions: it goes slow, But still attaines the end, towards which doth goe. Now such an Honest man I wish thee finde, As still is Honest, out of Honest minde: That's Wisdomes first ground: next is to propose A certaine forme of life; for euer those (Who diuers in themselues) aime at no end, But as occasion offers, each way tend, Neuer attaine the marke. If Hawke assay To trusse two Birds, she doth on neither prey: These grounds being laid, an vnfain'd Pietie Must build thereon, and though that diuers be Religions, Lawes; yet ours amongst them all Is truest, purest, most authenticall. Religion true, loues God, and quiets vs, And rests in a Soule free and generous: Where superstition is a franticke error, A weake mindes sicknesse, &amp; the owne Soules terror: Religious men doe still feare God for loue, The superstitious, lest they torments proue. Let thy Mate be a man, whose setled faith In true Religion sure foundation hath: For 'twixt those bodies loue doth best reside, Whose soules no selfe-opinions doe diuide: The foure chiefe Vertues next in order goe, From which the rest as from foure fountaines flow; Prudence the first place hath, to see and chuse, Which is so needfull, and of so great vse, That with it weighty things doe seeme but light, Without it nothing can be done of weight; By it things euen 'gainst Nature are atcheiued, A wise minde gaines what many hands hath grieued. Iust he must be Himselfe first to command, For sensuall things at Reasons Law must stand, The Spirits power keepes the Passions still in awe, And strictly bounds them with an austere Law, With Moderation it guides our desires, (We must not all condemne) Nature requires To loue things neat and needfull, base things hate, It's wantonnesse to liue too delicate: But it's meere madnesse to condemne the things Which needfull vse, and common custome brings. Next, to his Neighbour he that right must doe Which he expects, (freely not forc'd thereto;) Whom Law constraines, they falsifie all trust, It's conscience, not constraint that makes men iust. As iust, so valiant would I haue him be, Not out of rashnesse or stupiditie, It is a constant patient resolution Of bashlesse Courage 'gainst the reuolution Of times and fortunes: it regards not paines, Where Honor is the Hire, Glory the gaines: It's sensible carefull mans selfe to saue, Not daring offer wrong, more then receiue. As Prudent, Iust, and valiant, so he must Be temperate, this vertue hath foule lust, And pleasure for it's obiect: it commands, Laps, and reformes our sensuall thoughts; it stands 'Twixt a desire, and dulnesse of our nature, And is the spurrer on, or the abater Of ill or good, shamefast in refusing Things filthy, honest in things comely chusing; Though with perfection these no one man fits, Yet let him be free from their opposits: He must be sober, not giuen to excesse, It cures, and keepes in health, minde it doth dresse; Making it pure, and capable of good, It's Mother, and good counsell is the Brood: Excesse doth dull the Spirits, and breeds disease, So after punish'd by what first did please. Learn'd let him be, his learning generall, Profound in none, yet haue some skill in all; Whose deeply learn'd, his Booke is most his Wife, Conuersing still with it, so of his Life His Wife not halfe enioyes, for most is spent In study, so what should yeeld most content, Societie's debar'd; I doe wish then Who are meere Schollars, may liue single men: Learning besots the weake and feeble minde; But polishes the strong, and well inclin'd: The one Vaine-glory puffes with selfe conceit, The others braine is setled iudgements seat. Then so learn'd let him be, as he may chuse Flowers of best Bookes, whose sweet sent he may vse To rectifie his knowledge, and distill From thence life-blessing precepts, which so will Temper his vnderstanding, that the frowne Of fickle Fortune neuer shall cast downe. Not bold in speech, no man of many words Chuse thou a Husband, leauy tree affords The smallest store of fruit: Both words and deeds Seldome, or neuer from one Man proceeds. Who guides his words, he in a word is wise: Yet let him not be sullenly precise, But gentle, pleasing, not crabbed, or tart, The wise mans tongue is euer in his heart; The fooles heart's in his tongue: it is great gaine For to be silent, and ones selfe containe. And see with whomsoeuer he conuerse, (Lest he be thought ill nurtur'd, or peruerse) That he be kinde, obsequious, affable, To fit himselfe vnto their humors, able To change condition with the time, and place, Is wisdome, and such leuity doth grace: So Aristippus each face, each behauiour Did still become, and was a gracing fauour. Choose thou a Husband older by some yeares Then thou thy selfe art, Man age better beares Then Women: for bearing of children makes Their Strength decay, soone beautie them forsakes: Many crops make a field soone to be bare, Where that that beares not long continues faire. Now Lady such a man I wish you finde, As here I haue describ'd, with whom to binde Your selfe, is to be blest, leading a life Full of content, free from contentious strife. A Wiues behauiour. Bvt to finde good, is not enough to show, But hauing found him, how to keepe him so; Then since I haue aduis'd you how to chuse him, I will giue some aduice how you should vse him. Obedience first thy will to his must fit, (He is the Pylot that must gouerne it) It man condemnes of inabilitie, When Women rule, that are borne to obey: Nor is it Honor to Her, but a shame To be match'd with one onely man in name: But if imperious, He should more desire Then due respect doth of a Wife require; Thinke not harsh stubbornnesse will ere procure him To be more milde (it rather will obdure him.) The whip and lash the angry Horse inrages, Milde voice and gentle stroke his ire asswages: From steele-strucke flint we see the lightning flies, But strucke 'gainst wooll, the flashing flame none spies; Nor is the clangor hard: the ones soft nature Is to the others hardnesse an abature. Win thou thy Mate with mildnes: for each crosse Answer'd with anger, is to both a losse; Like as the Sea which 'gainst a churlish rocke Breakes brauing billowes with a boistrous stroke, Seeking by raging force to throw on sands The stiffe resisting rocke, which vnmou'd stands, Repelling his bold billowes with like scorne, As th' others brauery had bownst them beforne; Thus both still striue, and striuing are o'recome, The rocke is worne, the Billow's crush'd in fome: Whereas the Sea calmely the Sand imbraces, And with smooth forehead louingly it graces: Being content that it should bound his shore, Yeelding to mildnesse, where force fail'd before. So let thy mildnesse winne thy Husband to it, If that doe not, then nothing else will doe it: Beware you (willing) to no anger moue him, If he perceiue't, he cannot thinke you loue him: If anger once begin twixt Man and Wife, If soone not reconcil'd, it turnes to strife: Which still will stirre on euery light occasion, What might haue ceas'd in silence; then perswasion Of friends will hardly end: for euery iarre Is ominous presaging life long warre. And where two ioyn'd doe iar, their state decayes, They goe not forward, who draw diuers wayes, Being yoakt together: your first care must be, That with your Husband you in loue agree: As farre from fondnesse be, as from neglect, Mixing affection with a staid respect: If toying fondnesse were Mans onely ayme, Not reason, but his lust should chuse his Dame; Where Whores lasciuious, that can wayes inuent Should equalize thee, nay, giue more content: No, these are not the Ioyes he hopes to finde, The Body not so much he weds, as minde. Be neuer fond, nor without cause vnkinde, These are the fruits of an inconstant minde: Thou must not if his fortunes doe decline, Be discontented, or seeme to repine, But beare a constant countenance not dismaid, As if you were of misery afraid: His fortunes you must good or bad abide, With chaines of mutuall loue, together tide. The losse of that which blind-fold Chance doth giue, Cannot a worthy generous minde agrieue: For it will neuer take it for a crosse, Which cannot make one wicked by its losse: Nor by the gaining good, both foole and knaue Are often rich, if such afflictions haue, They driue them to despaire: but draw the wise, With eleuated thoughts, such things despise. Seneca saith, the gods did take delight To see graue Cato, with his Fate to fight: O! what should we, whose hopes doe higher rise, If Heathens thus could worldly things despise? Affliction oft doth mount the Wiser hie, Ioseph and Iob rose by aduersitie: It's signe of a weake minde to be deiected For worldly losse, (such neuer are respected) If thou wouldst not be irkesome to thy mate, Be cheerefull, not succumbing with his fate: Yet if that anguish doth afflict his minde, You must not seeme so from the world refin'd As to disdaine what humane crosse brings forth, Pride to be singular, that is, not worth: Nay, thou must be a mirror, to reflect Thy Husbands minde; for as is his aspect, So should be thine. Pale PhÅbe yeelds no light, When th' interpos'd earth bars hir PhÅbus sight: But when no obiect intercepts his streames, Shee deckes her selfe with light rebating beames. Euen so as is thy Husbands ioy, or paine, So must thy ioy and sorrow waxe, or waine: Be not too curious in his wayes to prie, Suspition still makes the suspected trie Iealousie's feare: for why should shee suspect That knowes her selfe guiltie of no defect? If he perceiue thee of thy selfe despaire, He will thinke sweeter ioyes are otherwhere, Which thou dost want; so thou thy selfe shalt giue The first occasion to what may thee grieue: Thy owne desert must Him vnto thee binde, Desert doth make a sauage to be kinde: It is an Adamantine chaine to knit Two soules so fast, nought can them disunite; Where that most sweet communion of the mindes. Saue each in other, no contentment findes; And whatsoeuer the one touches neere, Iealous, the other ne're conceales for feare. Brutus his honor (dearer pris'd then life) Concredited to Portia his Wife; What feare from dearest friends caus'd him conceale, Worth and desert made him to her reueale Great CÃ¦sars death, and who his consorts were, With their designes, he did impart to her; Nor is their birth, or beautie of such might, To alienate their hearts, or giue delight: Who had more beautie then that captiu'd Queene, The faire Statira, when in griefe was seene The pearly haile blasting her beautie fields, Which seemelinesse euen cloath'd in sorrow yeelds; Being grac'd with modestie, and vnstain'd faith, More force still fairenesse with such fellowes hath: Yet could not her faire beautie moue the thought Of Alexander, (though lesse faire haue brought Oft Captaines to be captiues) nor her state (Shee being maried) did affection bate: For then her Uirgin Daughter yet vnstain'd, (Whose beautie all comparison disdain'd, Going her louely mother so before, As she did all the rest of Asia's store) Should quickly haue intangled his desire, Whose heart all one, Roxane's loue did fire: For if proportion, colour, wealth, or birth, Could haue captiu'd the Monarch of the Earth; These should haue won: but he did Her preferre, Whose onely merits pleaded loue for her. Deserue then not in shew, but from the heart, Loue is perpetuated by desert. As it befits not Man for to imbrace Domesticke charge, so it's not Womans place For to be busied with affaires abroad: For that weake sexe it is too great a load, And it's vnseemely, and doth both disgrace, When either doth vsurpe the others place: Leaue his to him, and of thine owne take charge, Care thou at home, and let him care at large: Thou hast enough thy selfe for to imploy Within doores, 'bout thy house and huswifery: Remember that it's said of Lucrece chaste, When some Dames wantoniz'd, others tooke rest, Shee with her Maidens first her taske would end, E're she would sleepe: she did not idle spend Swift running Time, nor gaue alluring pleasure The least aduantage, to make any seisure On her rare vertues. A soule vacant still Is soone seduced to doe good or ill: For like perpetuall motion is the minde, In action still, while to this flesh confinde; (From which foule prison it takes often staines, For absolutely good no man remaines.) Imploi'd if not 'bout good, about some ill, Producing fruits which doe discouer still How it is labour'd like a fertile field, Which fruit, or weeds abundantly doth yeeld, As it is manur'd; be not idle then, Nor giue vice time to worke vpon thy braine Imagined ill: for what it there conceiues, It oft brings out, and in dishonour leaues: The purest things are easiest to be stain'd, And it's soone lost which carefully was gain'd. Penelope did wheele and distaffe handle, And her daies worke vndid at night by candle; Nor labour-forcing need compeld that taske, Which toiling daies, and tedious nights did aske: (For she was Queene of Ithacke) 'twas her name, Which vertuous care kept spotlesse free from blame; One of so many suiters of each sort, As for her loue did to her Court resort, Not speeding; would haue spoke that might her staine, (The greatest hate, when loue turnes to disdaine:) If colour could haue made their knauery stronger, But Enuie could not finde a way to wrong her. Be thou as these, carefull of house-wiferie, With Prouidence what's needfull still supplie: Looke thy Maids be not idle, nor yet spend Things wastingly: for they so oft offend, When carelesse is the Mistris; yet with need Ne're pinch them, nor yet let them e're exceed: The one doth force them seeke thee to betray, The other makes them wanton, and too gay; It is no shame to looke to euery thing, The Mistris eie doth euer profit bring. Salomon saith, the good Wife seekes for flaxe And wooll, wherewith her hands glad trauell takes: Shee's like a ship that bringeth bread from farre, Shee rises e're appeare the morning Starre; Uittles her Houshold, giues her Maidens food, Surueyes, and buyes a field, plants vines, with good Gain'd by her hands: What Merchandize is best She can discerne, nor doth she goe to rest When PhÅbus hides his head, and barres his sight, But by her Lampe, her hands doe take delight To touch the wheele and spindle; she doth stretch Her hand to helpe the poore and needy wretch: Her words are wisdome, she ore'sees her traine, That idle none doe eat their bread in vaine; Her children rise and blesse her, sweet delight Her Husband takes still in her happy sight. Be thou this carefull Goodwife, for to lend Thy helping hand, thy Husbands meanes to mend. Last let thy conuersation be with such, As foule-mouth'd malice can with no crime tutch: I cannot but condemne such as delight Still to be sad and sullen in the sight Of their owne Husbands, as they were in feare, (Sure guiltie of some crime such Women are) But when they gossip it with other wiues Of their owne cut, then they haue merrie liues, Spending, and plotting how they may deceiue Their Husbands, rule themselues, and mastrie haue; O let such Women (for they make-bates be 'Twixt Man and Wife) neuer consort with thee: But shunne them, as thou dost see one that's faire Flee the small poxe; both like infectious are. The graue, staid, blamelesse, and religious Dames, Whose carriage hath procur'd them honest names; Are fit companions, let such be thy Mates, When wearied with affaires, thou recreates Thy selfe with harmelesse mirth: yet doe not walke Often abroad, that will occasion talke; Though thou hast store of friends, yet let none be (Sauing thy Husband) Counseller to thee; Hee's neerest to thee, and it will indeare him, He is thy selfe thou needest not to feare him: Be free with him, and tell him all thy thought, It's He must helpe, when thou hast need of ought; And constantly beleeue he'le loue thee best, When he sees thou preferr'st him 'fore the rest. Thus Lady, haue I shew'd you how to chuse A worthy Mate, and how you should him vse; So chuse, so vse, so shall you all your life Be in a Husband blest, he in a Wife: And when Death here shall end your happy daies, Your Soules shall raigne in Heauen, on Earth your praise. FINIS. ELEGIES, ON THE DEATH OF OVR LATE Soueraigne QVEENE ANNE. With Epitaphs. To the most Noble Prince Charles. Disdaine not Sir, this offering which I make Although the incense smoke doth towre so blacke; Nor thinke my fires faint, 'cause they darkly shine. Tapers burne dimme, are set before a shrine. Some better hap to haue their first fruit glad, This C?mon woe masques mine in mourning shade: And's strange, You (solely left for our reliefe) For salue, doe proue a cor'siue to our griefe: Weigh what it is to adde to those opprest, Then by Your woe, ours shall not be increast: I grant, nor Sonne nor Subiect good, can smother Griefe, for so great, &amp; good, a Queen &amp; Mother. Yet moderate this sorrow; as you're seene To vse in Ioy, so vse in griefe a meane, Ore match thy matchlesse selfe, that all may see Her courage, worth and loue, doe liue in Thee: Then may this pen, which with teares drawes my plaint, In gold Thy glorious actions after paint. Your Highnesse most humble seruant, Patrick Hannay. The first Elegie. As doth a Mother, who before her eyes As doth a Mother, who before her eyes, Her Ages hope, her onely Sonne espies Butcher'd, and bathing still in bloudy strands, Rauisht with sudden griefe amazed stands; Nor weepes, nor sighes, nor lets one teare distill, But (with fixt eye) still gazeth on her ill: But when with time her smothered griefe forth vents, She wastes her eyes in teares, her breath in plaints: So we astonisht could not tell our woe; Who doe grieue most, least signes of griefe doe show, Yet time to those, in time, a time affords, To weepe and waile, and shew their woe in words. Time grant vs now this time, lest of her praise Our of-spring hearing, and when her swift dayes Had run their course, they heare none of our plaints, Doe either thinke some Poets pen her paints, Or that they are of the same stones all sprung, Which backward Pyrrha and Deucalion flung. So that will seeme no fable, but a story, If we doe leaue no witnesse that we're sorry, Each senslesse thing shall vs vpbraid to them, And as lesse sensible (then they) condemne: Since in each obiect offer'd to the eye, Signes of sad sorrow settled there we see: The Heauens (tho grac'd with her) for vs are grieu'd And weepe in showers for that we are bereau'd Of her; in, and for whom the World was blest, In whom her kindes perfection did consist. Aquarius seemes to haue a solemne feast, And that each other signe's his houshold guest. Not one of them now influence downe powres, But what distils in liquid weeping showres. The Skies of Clowdes now make them mourning weeds, And generall darknesse all the world o're-spreads: What? hath the Sunne for a new Phaeton Abandoned the Heauens, and beamie throne? Is the cause theirs? or doth it touch vs nie? (Since with their sorrow we so sympathie:) No, it's because our Cynthia left this spheare, The world weares black, because she moues not here, Her influence that made it freshly flourish, Leaues it to fade, and will no more it nourish. Leaues it? hath left. How can it then subsist? Can that be said to be, which dispossest Or soule, wants vigor? this Queene was the soule, Whose faculties worlds frailties did controule; Corrected the ill humors, and maintain'd In it a wholesome concord, while she raign'd: But now (she gone) the world seemes out of frame, Subord'nate passions now as Princes clame Signorie o're the soule, which doe torment The whole with anguish; make the heart to faint, Whose sad infection generally's so spred, Griefes Character on euery brow is read. Our eies so drop (wer't not God frees those feares) The world might dread a new deluge of teares. Dread? (thus distrest) we rather should desire With the worlds dissolution to expire Our latest woes, 'twere better haue no being, Then liue in woe, so as we are still dying. Leaue foolish passion, dares thou thus repine 'Gainst what's enacted by the powers diuine? Humbly submit, yet passion were a word, Vselesse, a nothing's name, speech should afford No place for it, if it should not now show It's being by our grieuing in this woe? Yet the wo's short, which on each soule hath seaz'd, It and the cause can ne're be equaliz'd: I will not blaze her birth, descent or State, Her Princely Progenie, her royall mate: They're knowne best, and greatest, yet these are But accidentall honours: but this starre With proper beames was so resplendent here, Others (though bright) yet when she did appeare, Did lose their lustre: she honour'd her place, Her place not her: she Queene, was Queen's sole grace. 'Twas she the Antique Poets so admir'd, When with prophetique furie they inspir'd, Did faine the heauenly powers, they did see, (As in a dreame) that such a one should be: And for each seuerall grace, she should containe, One Deitie they did for that ordaine, Not one for all, for that too much had beene, To faine her like, whose like was neuer seene. Nor is their number equall to her merits, For she a farre off was shew'd to those spirits, Now had they liu'd her vertues to haue seene; The Goddesses sure numberlesse had beene, But's well they did not, for then she should be (Though guiltlesse) yet cause of Idolatrie, For they who honoured her shade before, Seeing her substance needs must it adore. The Morallists did all of her diuine, When they made euery vertue fÅminine; And but they knew that such a one should be, Doubtlesse with them vertue should haue beene He. Peruse all stories are compil'd by Man, Or Poets fictions since the world began, You shall not finde (true or imaginarie) Like worth in one, whose all's in nought doth varie. Nay, take the obiects in these bookes reuil'd For basest parts, so vicious and defil'd, As they seeme Natures monsters, made in scorne, As foiles, her other faire workes to adorne, (Contrar's oppos'd doe others best set forth) They serue not all, to parallel her worth. They are deceiu'd, who say the world decaies, And still grows worse and worse, as old with daies: For then this Age could neuer that haue showne Which was long since to Salomon vnknowne, A woman: but had he liued in our times, He might haue found one so deuoid of crimes, That her owne merits (if merits could saue) Might iustly (as of due) saluation craue. I rather thinke the worlds first Infancie, Growing more perfect with Antiquitie, (As younglings doe) trauel'd till now at height, Big of perfection, brought this birth to light: This second to that Maiden-Mother-Daughter, She only was before, this only after: For on this Grace and Nature spent such store, As after her we need expect none more, And those who read her praise when we are gone, Would thinke we but describ'd a worthy one, Not that there was one such, but that she here Left part of her, which and it's seed shall beare Successiue witnesse to all doubtfull ages, Of her rare vertues, which in those deare pledges Still liue: they'le say our praise came short, we dull With speech defectiue, could not to the full Set forth her worth, which she at death did giue: Others may goods not goodnesse off-spring leaue. But she bequeath'd her goodnesse for her merit Obtain'd her issue should that wealth inherit, Which we possesse in them, while they doe prease (As vsurers) that stocke still to increase: Only ambitious to augment that store, Robbing the world, which either is but poore: Or seemes so, set by them, beggers may boast, But they alone haue all that wealth ingrost: And though that God the worlds gold hath refinde, And tooke the tri'd, He left this veine behinde, Pittying the drosse the luster should obscure, Of her bright soule, while flesh did it immure. Yet did He not with it of all bereaue vs, But with her of-spring, happinesse did leaue vs. For her preferment, why then should we tosse Our soules with torment? or grieue that our losse Hath Heauen inrich'd? or 'cause we held her deare, Wish we her punisht, to beliuing here? We rather should reioyce she thus did leaue vs, And nought but Heauen alone of her could reaue vs. O! since that Cedar fell so right at last, Which way it standing lean'd, may well be ghest. And since the End doth crowne the actions still, How liued she, who dying, di'd so well! For askt, if she did willing hence depart, Said, (rapt with heauenly ioy) With All My Hart. Though flesh be fraile, yet hers so void of feare, (For death did not in his owne shape appeare) Did entertaine so kindly it's owne foe, (Who came to Court, but vn'wares kild her so) As she esteem'd it only one hard thrust At that strait gate by which to life we must: Faith, Hope, and Loue possest her heart and minde, Leauing no place for fearefull thoughts to finde: Troupes of white Angels did her bed impaile, To tend the soules flight from the fleshly gaile, It to conduct vnto that heauenly throne, Which Christ prepar'd, with glore to crowne her on. O! how my flesh-clog'd soule would scale the skie, And leaue that deare companion here to lie, To see her entertain'd, with glory crown'd, While troupes of Angels her ariuall sound To that new kingdome: they all God doe praise For her translation, and their voices raise, In signe of Ioy, but yet that Ioy comes short Of what they make for most to them resort, For, for the greater sinner, Christ hath said, That doth repent, the greater ioy is made: Yet that's made vp in glore, for she so farre Doth those exceed, as one another starre: What may we thinke vnto her soule is showne, When from her baser-part such vertue's flowne As a sad reuerent feare their senses pierce, Who sighing see her sorrow-suted-Hearse: What would they doe, if their vaild soule could spie Her sitting crown'd aboue the starrie skie? Sure they would doe (nay in their hearts they doe) Euen at the thought thereof with reuerence bow. But leaue to speake, nay, not so much as thinke, Least of those Ioyes which ne're in heart could sinke. Lets not enuy'er, but inueigh 'gainst our Fate, That we behinde her are staid here so late: And let's not mourne for her, that she's gone hence, But for our selues, that we are kept from thence Whither she's gone: yet let no teare o're-flow, (Sorrow soone-ceaseth that's disburdned so) Let them straine inward, if they'le needs distill. And with their drops thy hearts sad center fill, And when it's full, it can no more containe, Let the caske breake, and drowne thee in that maine. ON THE QVEENE. The world's a Sea of errors, all must passe, Where shelues and sands the purling billow blindes: Mens bodies are fraile barks of brittle glasse, Which still are toss'd with aduerse tides &amp; windes, Reason's the Pylot that the course directs, Which makes the vessell (as it's height) hold out, Passions are partners, a still-iarring-rout: Succumbing-thoughts are life inuading leakes. How built her body! such a voyage made; How great her reason! which so rightly sway'd; How pliant passions! which so well obay'd; How dantles thoughts, vaine doubts durst ne're inuade. Her body, reason, passions, thoughts did 'gree, To make her life the Art to saile this Sea. The Second Elegie Each Countrie now contributes to the Thames Each Countrie now contributes to the Thames, Which a support of euerie currant clames: Why dost thou so sweet Thames? Is not thy sorrow Sufficient for thy selfe, but thou must borrow? Or wants thy waters worth for such a charge, As to conduct Great Annes last body'd-barge? Or is it 'cause so iust and kinde thou art, Thou'lt not incroach that, wherein each hath part? Sure that's the cause; the losse is generall, And that last Office must be helpt by all. Yet wonder not they come not now so sweet, As they doe vse, when they to solace meet: They're not themselues, they are compounded things, For euery one his latest offring brings, And sends it by these Brookes, vnto Her Shrine, Whose waters with their teares are turned brine: Each subiects cheeke such falling drops distaine, As if to dew, sighes had dissolu'd the braine: Which from their eyes still in abundance powre, Like a moist haile, or liquid pearly showre: Which in such haste, each one another chases, Making swift torrents in late torrid places, Disgorging in these Brookes, making them rise, So 's soueraigne Thames almost feares a surprise: Feare not (faire Queene) it is not their ambition, But swelling sorrow, that breeds thy suspition: It's sorrow feeds those currents and those rils, Which thy vast channell with an Ocean fils, Which eye-bred-humor so hath chang'd thy Nature, Thy fishes thinke they liue not in thy water: It, or their taste is alter'd, for they thinke For thy sweet streames they briny liquor drinke: How weary'd is thy Sister famous Forth, Bringing sad Scotland's sorrowes from the North; Who comes not out of dutie, as the rest Who vnto Thames their carefull course adrest; She comes, her equall, will not yeeld in teares, In subiects sorrow's, nor in countries cares. Great Neptune's selfe doth feare inuasiue wrong, Seeing her strange waues through his waters throng; And causeth Triton to sound an alarme, To warne the Sea-Gods in all haste to arme; Who bringing billowes in braue battell-ray, Doe meane Forth's fury with their force to stay: But when they see her thus all wrapt in woe, And the sad cause of her iust sorrow know; They lay not their defensiue armes aside, But as a guard, her through their gulfes do guide; Striuing with all the pleasures of the Maine, This grieuing-stranger-Queene to entertaine, Out through their bours of cleare transparant waues, Crystalline-wainscot, pearle the bottome paues: Her they conduct, and to abate her woe, Their Sea-delights and riches all they show, Which Neptune (now in loue) would gladly giue her For loue, yet dares not offer lest hee grieue her; Who loues and would not haue his loue vnkinde, Must wooe a pleasant humor, vacant minde: This makes him stay his sute, and striue to please With all the loue-allurements of the Seas: Yet all doe not so much as moue one smile, An anxious sorrow soone discouer'th guile; Yet he will guide and guard her grieuing streames, Whom at her entry in the wished Thames He leaues, and vowes in discontent to mourne, Till fairest Forth backe to the Sea returne. Her sister her receiues with kind embrace, Their liquid armes clasping, they interlace In loue so straight, they cannot be vntwinde; They seeme both one, in body and in minde. O happy vnion! labour'd long in vaine, Reseru'd by God to Iames his ioyfull raigne, And Annes; O blessed couple so esteem'd By all fore-knowing loue, that He them deem'd Worthy each other, and to weare that Iemme, Blest Britaines now vnited-Diademe. He esteem'd none, worthy to wear't before them, But kept it still in store, for to decore them. How did He suffer those two Kingdomes trie All open power, and priuate policie; Yet still increased discord, others force Made separation greater, su'd diuorce. How did one teare the other, spare no toyle, To bath in bloud the neighbours fertile soile; Wrath, discord, malice, enuy, rapine, strife, Thefts, rapes, and murderous mischieues were so rife, None liu'd secure, while each King did protect The others fugitiues, (for his respect) Thus looking for no rest, or end of hate, But with the ruine of the aduerse State: God, he effects it (that to him alone We might ascribe the honour; and being one, We might loue better: Twixt vnited foes, And separated friends. loue and hate groes To greatest heights:) And for this end doth raise, (Using the meanes) the honour of his dayes, Great Iames, the ioy presaging Northerne Starre, Whose radiant light illuminates so farre, As it doth warme with its all-quickning-beames The frozen-loue betwixt the Tay and Thames; With wonder and delight, drawing all hearts And eyes. to loue and see his Princely parts. And (what is strange) who hated most before, With admiration, most his worth adore, Wishing they were his subiects: He is King Alreadie of their hearts; the poyson'd sting Of rancor is remou'd, for loue they call him, And with their Kingdomes ornaments install him, Great confidence his vertuous life must bring, Whom such old foes, loue forces make their King. Where was ere heard, of emulating foes, (Rooted in hate with others ouerthrowes Such and so long) that did their wrath appease, And yeeld (won but by loue) to right, as these? Yet doe they not repent, they finde report Sometime is wrong'd, and may indeed come short In commendations; yet its rare (as here) For she's a woman, and (by kinde) will beare More then she should: but his last subiects finde Themselues with Saba's Queene of self-same minde, That fame (though saying by beliefe) had wrong'd Two Kings, not telling halfe to each that long'd; For England heard not, nor could it haue thought, That Scotl?ds king such wonders could haue wrought Long may he liue, and die well, full of yeeres, And when his death shall draw vs dry with teares, On Britaines Throne may his seed euer raigne, Till Christ doe come (to iudge the world) againe. Who would haue thought from the Scot-hated-Dane, Whom vanquish'd England so much did disdaine, (Opprest with base subiection) they did turne, (Being freed) Lord-dane to lurdane for a scorne; Who would haue thoght (I say) fr? Dane shold spring One, who from Scots and English eyes should wring Such heartie teares; must not her worth be much, Since we doe finde its-loue-effects proue such, How great that worth (in such, such loue could breed) O let it liue for euer in her seed: And let that loue in our hearts neuer die, But euer liue to her Posteritie: And those sweet streames her mate and she combinde In loue, O let their armes be nere vntwinde From kinde embraces, and though now their greetings Be not so ioyfull as at other meetings; Yet is their loue all one, they take one part, The one ioyes not, the other sad at heart: They surfeit now in sorrow, then in pleasure; Ioy then exceeds, griefe now is aboue measure. To honour Charles (our hope) when they met last, How did they rob each meadow as they past, Of sweetes, each banke a posie did bestow, Of fairest flowers, that on his brim did grow: These and such like, they brought from euery part, And gratulations from each subiects heart: They swel'd with pride, rising in loftie waues, And all the neighbour bordring bankes out-braues: Their fishes frolick'd, shewing ioy by gesture, The waters (wantonizing) woo'd their Master; So fast their billowes 'bout his blest barge throng'd, They hurt themselues oft, oft their fellowes wrong'd: Each would be first, on others backes some ride, Some vnder others slippry shoulders slide, Though beat with ores, yet will they not turne back, For they their humble prostrate homage make: The Sun then guilt each glistring-glassie-coat, Those Marin-masquers wore, danc'd 'bout his boat; Who by the musicke measur'd not their paces; Deaf'd with a confus'd cry from diuers places, Of maidens, matrons, aged men, and boyes, Which from each quarter made a confus'd noyse Of hearty Aue's, welcomming their Prince, Eccho (with answering tyr'd) was mute still since. The Citie with the suburbs did appeare Like a large Theater when he came neare: Eeach window, wall, each turret top and steeple, Was fild with euery age, sexe, sort of people: So as some thought (who earst had neuer seene Such numbers) that the buildings all had beene Of Imagry contriu'd, by cunning Art: For on the ground, the Brewer in his cart, The Sculler, Carman. and the baser sort, Seem'd strong and rudely caru'd clownes, to support The stately frame: Maides, Prertises and groomes, Made shop-doore, window, stale, and lower roomes: The batlements, house-couerings and the leads, As tyles or slates, yong boyes and girles ore-spreads (The middle roomes all round about the Thames, Which Ladies held, and choiser Citie-Dames) Such tooke for spaces, which faire statues held, Where Caruer and the Painter both exceld; So pure complexions these seem'd made by Art, As Nature neuer did the like impart To louely youth; The large, low, open breast, Full, white, round, swelling, azure-vain'd, increast The error, for they thought none liuing would Lay out such parts, for all eyes to behold: So curious were the colours which were showne, As Nature hardly could from Art be knowne: So that they could adiudge them due to neither: But participles, taking part of either, Yet all by voyce and gesture seemed glad, Wonder it was to see a thing looke sad. Now its not so, the offrings are but teares, The sighes, and groanes, of Britaines blest-reft sheres Are now the acclamations; these two streames, Compounded waters of mixt sorrow seemes; Yet walke they hand in hand with equall pace, T'wards that late pleasant, but now pensiue place Where sorrow suted in a sable weed, Doth with a mourning vaile each heart ore-spread, And PhÅbus for to make the world and minde To weare one liuerie, all his beames confinde, Dimming each eye in darknesse of the night, Either asham'd to mourne in open sight, Or loth to alter with his brighter streames Our late obscured Cynthia's lesser gleames; For her fled soule which doth with glory shine, Left with it's lodging something that's diuine, Which with reflection smileth on these raies, Which her bright soule now from the skies displays. And these light orbes which with such swiftnes roule About the Heauens, acquainted with her soule, To light her corps, doe set in euery porch Of the damantine Heauen, a starry torch, Which darkned with the weeping Earths moist vapours, Are her last lampes and neuer-dying tapers. Thames trembles, Forth doth feuerise for feare, Both roare to see their soueraigne thus appeare: Their billowes breake their hearts against the shore. Their fishes faint (yet cannot tell wherefore) But when they float vpon the water crop, And see the teares from eies and Oars which drop; They thinke them all too few, and adde their owne, And swimme in proper waters (earst vnknowne) The water-Nymphes now round about her boat, Cloath'd in sad sable mourning habits float, The Hamadryads, and the Siluans all To beare a part in this complaint they call. Who since her death, had practis'd in their teares, Stremes deepe enough: none now the water feares, They brought with them sweet Camomile and Rew, Mint, Spicknard, Marioram, her way they strew, With flowers of choicest colour and of sent, Which from the slender-weeping-stalke was rent. Her Exequies these Nymphes together sing, Till with this consort, Heauen and Earth doth ring: Heauens inuying our waters, walkes, and woods, Hath reft our ioy, and plac'd her 'mongst the Gods. No more our wandring waues shall wantonize, No more shall swelling billowes braue the skies, No more shall purling Zephyr curle our head; No more we'le foamy-powders thereon spread, No more shall now Meandrian walkes delight vs, No more despaire with death shall now affright vs, Since heauen enuying our late happie floods, Hath 'reft our ioy, and plac'd her 'mongst the Gods. Wee'l take no sport now to persue the Fawne, Wee'l no more tread light measures on the Lawne, Wee'l decke our heads no more with Flora's flowers, Wee'l wooe no more our woody Paramours, Wee'l beare no part hereafter with the birds, Wee'l weep for woe, and teach them waile in words; Since heauen enuying our late happy woods, Hath reft our ioy, and plac'd her 'mongst the Gods. Wee'l hide our heads within our shores and shelues. Wee'l dwell in darkest cypresse groues with elues. No more wee'l solace in great Neptunes hals, No more wee'l dance at Syluanes festiuals, Because she's gone, whose glory grac'd our floods, Because she's gone, who honour'd walkes and woods. Thus sung they her along, but come to shore, Where she must leaue them, they ne're see her more, They sinke to bottome, either in a swone, Or else themselues (now loathing life) to drowne. The Forth and Thames losing their so lou'd-sight, Vow, yearely to renew their woes, that night. An Epitaph. Power to doe ill, and practise only good, Humblest in hart, highest in place &amp; bloud, Fairest, and fre'st from loose-desires in thought, Pleasures to tempt, yet not distain'd in ought: With anxious care, in courage ne're deiected; Though cause of ioy, with no vaine-ioy affected. Know Reader, whensoere these lines you scan, Such (and none such but she) was our Queene Anne. An Epitaph. A Wife, a Daughter, Sister to a King, Mother to those, whose hopes doe higher spring, Chaste, faire, wise, kinde; first, Crowne-vnited wore, We knew her such, and held her for no more. That she was more, Gods daughter and heauens heire, We know, since parted hence he crown'd her there. SONGS and SONNETS. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE S? Andrevv Gray KNIGHT, COLONELL of a foot regiment, and Generall of the Artillerie to the high and mightie Prince Fredericke King of Bohemia. If of these labours I did none direct, Braue sir, to you for offering or for shield, Since you so fatherly did me affect, When first you did conduct me to the field: I iustly might be taxed as ingrate, Deseruedly your loue might turne to hate. Let shriller Musquet, Cannon, Culuering, (Part of thy charge) with the skie-tearing-balls, Which treble, base, meane, tenor rudely sing To bloudy Mars, forcing the dancing walls, Giue place a space while I doe entertaine Your eares with Musicke of a milder straine. Sterne Mars himselfe hath oft-times danc'd a measure, (Armes laid aside) his Minions most deare Haue woo'd the Muses, and haue taken pleasure To tune their owne, and others notes to heare: Thou art a proofe hereof thy selfe most plaine, Who in their Art hast had so sweet a vaine. To none more aptly can I then direct These lines then thee, who both hast skill to proue, And worth (more then their errors) to protect, To none I'm so indebted for such loue. Accept them as they're sent with loue sincere, With kind construction read them whilst you're here. I know thy haughtie spirit much disdaines This loth'd detention, for I haue beene by When thy hot courage well-nie crack'd the raines Of strict command, (when the fierce foe drew nie) That to thy valour freedome was not giuen, Those Popish hirelings might by thee be shriuen. Nor was it wage or want that spurd thee on, No hope of spoile nor thirsting after bloud: But worth-bred-loue of that rare Paragon, Thy deare Kings daughter, whose cause doubtfull stood. Had doubted-Mansfelt led, you had your will, Pylsen preuented had this hapned ill. Yet shrinkes He not, nor thou, you both earne more, (That crosse your courage rather doth inflame) With sharpe reuenge the lost state to restore To that most worthie, best deseruing Dame, Whom euen her enemies so much doe honour, As women's rarest praises they throw on her. There are nine Worthies hitherto of men, But of all women, I not read of any: I know not then, whether she makes them ten, Or of her sexe first number vnto many: In spirit, courage, valour, to those nine She's equall; Women none yet so diuine. Goe in Her cause, successe crowne thy desires, Soone may I change this softly tuned song, Inflam'd with new and vnacquainted fires, To sing the Enemies reuenged wrong: Oh how I long in high heroicke verse, Their ruine, and Her rising to rehearse. Euer yours most affectionate in all humble dutie, Patrick Hannay. Song I. Sad Sheretine was seiz'd, And wounded so with woe, Fra He faire Mariana's faith Was falsified did know. Fra time he knew that her Another did possesse, Whom in his heart he had propos'd His height of happinesse: His tongue was sorrow-tied, His passion inward pent, His woes no passage could procure, Forth from his heart to vent. Hee scarce beleeues it so, Although himselfe it sees: To free her of so foule a fault, He blames his blamelesse eies: But when he found her false, Her vowes and oathes vntrue. As after he could ioy in nought, He bids the world adue. His woes to aggrauate, He causes doth inuent, Though cause of care he had enough, How he might more lament, A wofull banishment He willing vndertakes: And comfort-causing company He vtterly forsakes. In a care-clothed shade, From eie and eare remoued, He thus with woe begins to waile The losse of his beloued. Ah Mariana ah! Is thus my loue repai'd? Doe my fires still so freshly burne: And are thy flames decai'd? How constant haue I proued? Though many hairs there were Where I haue beene, yet none had force My fancie to insnare. Nor since thy fauour first Kindled my quenchlesse fire, Did I see beautie that could breed A dram of deare desire; Or if 'mongst fairest faires I thought one did excell: My loue was iealous of that thought, And straight did it repell: Wherein then did I faile? My heart doth hold it strange, That seeing I haue lou'd so well, I should finde such a change. No doubt the gods were grieu'd, That I did thee adore; 'Cause therein I Idolatriz'd, Haue plagued me therefore. Yet should not that in thee, Least alteration mou'd: It rather should thy loue indear'd, To be so dearely lou'd: Had'st thou with proud disdaine My fauour first refus'd, I might haue blam'd my haplesse fate, But not thy crime accus'd. My loue with time had died: Or if it still had liu'd, My care this comfort yet had had, That I for worth had grieu'd. But thou by granting loue, Didst bring me to such height Of hoped ioyes, to such a low Hast cast me with despight, That the sad souenance Of such a loue so lost, Is now my greatest cause of griefe, And doth molest me most. For if I nere had gain'd, My griefe had not beene such, The once-rich poore man grieueth more Then he that nere was rich. Whom Nature with her gifts 'Boue others did indue; O! that ads woe vnto my woe, That she should proue vntrue. If whilst on bloudy Mars I boldly did attend, By some braue hand had I exhal'd, Before thy crime was kend, Then had my wronged Ghost (Not conscious of this) With ioy expected thy approach, To the Elizian blisse. Or if it there had grieu'd, The sole cause of its mone Had beene lest that thou shouldst haue grieu'd To heare that I was gone. But now me thinks I heare Thy Turian with scorne Vpbraid thy crime as my disgrace; Fond Sheretin's forlorne. Me thinks thou seconds him, Not sensible thereof; And thy true louing Sheretine Rememberest with a scoffe. Another being wrong'd By such a deepe disdaine, Inrag'd might count it greater good To lose such then obtaine. But that the world may see, My first fires were not fain'd; They shall not therefore be extinct, 'Cause I am thus disdain'd. No, Turian whom I most Doe hate and least respect; 'Cause thou doest loue and honour him, I'le honour and affect. By that (still deare) thou'lt know By leauing me whats loft, If loue disdain'd can doe so much, What had it nere beene croft? But now since it's thy will That I doe suffer woe, I doe endeuour for thy sake The greatest griefe to know. Beare witnesse with me woods, Weeds watered with teares, How I doe liue deuoid of ioy, But you ther's none me hears: Nor ere shall more content Seize on my heauy heart, Witnesse with me while from this clay My sad soule doe depart. And Mariana faire My first and latest loue, My last words shall be that the heauens May blesse Thee from aboue: That thou maist still inioy The best of sweet content; And let my death (since loue could not) Moue Thee this fault repent. That when from hence thou fleet'st, Thy vnafflicted spirit May with of like-fault-guiltlesse soules A ioyfull peace inherit. That said he and no more, But on the bitter weeds His flesh forsaken feeble limmes He languishingly spreads. His weary soule remoues, Death seiz'd him by degrees; So true loues Martyr (not so wrong'd As he deem'd) thus he dies. Sonnet I. Eie, beauty, admiration, loue, desire, Did ioyne in one to set my heart on fire. My eie did see that beauty did surpasse, That boundles beauty made me much admire: With admiration loue conceiued was, And loue brought forth and nourish'd my desire; Which now is growne vnto so great perfection, It sees, admires, conceiues, seeds sans direction. Sonnet II. Experienc'd nature in this latter age, Willing her Master-peece should then be wroght Such my faire CÃ¦lia set on earths large stage, As all the Gods in emulation brought; For they did thinke, if Nature only might Brag of her worth, she should insult ore them. Wherefore they 'greed to haue an equall right, That they of her perfection part might claime, Pallas gaue wisdome, Iuno statelinesse, And the milde morning gaue her modesty: The Graces cariage, Uenus louelinesse, And chaste Diana choisest chastitie: Thus heauen and earth their powers did combine To make her perfect; kind loue make her mine. Sonnet III. Whilst wandring thoughts vnsetled in desire, Did roue at randome in the fields of loue, Where fancie found faire obiects fit to fire Frozen affection, choice did choice remoue: Cupid contemn'd taking it much at heart, For spite his dames loose darling made delight me; She leauing Venus taking Iuno's part, With new chast thoughts, &amp; fires 'gins to require me. Proud Cytherea angrie with her wench, Seekes in my heart a hate of her to breed, So blaz'd her faults, which soon my fires did quench, But Malice still lights on the owners head: For this the ill that all her enuie wrought; It made her chaste, me author of that thought. Sonnet IIII. Once early as the ruddy bashfull Morne Did leaue Dan PhÅbus purple streaming bed, And did with scarlet streames East-heau'n adorne, I to my fairest CÅlia's chamber sped: She Goddesse-like stood combing of her haire, Which like a sable veile did cloath her round, Her Iuorie combe was white, her hand more faire: She straight and tall, her tresses trail'd to ground; Amaz'd I stood, thinking my deare had beene Turn'd Goddesse, euery sense to sight was gone, With bashfull blush my blisse fled I once seene, Left me transformed (as it were) in stone. Yet did I wish so euer t'haue remain'd, Had she but stay'd, and I my sight retain'd. Sonnet V. While I doe Hope my thoughts doe high aspire, In deepe Despaire these hopes are quickly drown'd; Sometimes I burne with an Etnean fire: Sometimes I freeze: I swim, straight sinke to ground. O since such changes in my loue I finde, Death change my life; or Loue my CÅlia's minde. Sonnet VI. Alluding to Hope. Hope makes the Sea bee plow'd in furrowes white, That in the end sweet gaine may thence arise; Hope makes the toyling Trades-man take delight To labour ear' and late with watchfull eyes. Hope makes the Shepheard in the Winter care To tend his flocke, and lodge them from the cold. Hope makes the Soldier fight, sencelesse of Feare 'Mongst hot alarmes; both watch and ward to hold. The Sea-man's hope rich merchandise repaies: The Trades-man's hope is answer'd with his hyre, Yong Lambs and Wooll, the Shepheards charge defrayes, The Soldiers wage is that he doth require. I doe for Hope more then all these sustaine, Yet Hope with no reward repaies by paine. Song II. Amantium irÃ¦ amoris nediutegratio est. CÅlia iealous (lest I did In my heart affect another) Me her company forbid, Women cannot passion smother. The dearer loue the more disdaine, When truth is with distrust required; I vow'd (in anger) to abstaine, Shee found her fault and me inuited. I came with intent to chide her (Cause she had true loue abus'd) Resolu'd neuer to abide her, Yet her fault she so excus'd, As it did me more intangle, Telling, True loue must haue feares; They nere lou'd that nere did wrangle, Louers iarres, but loue indeares. Sonnet VII. When as I wake I dreame oft of my deare, And oft am serious with her in my sleepe; I am oft absent when I am most neare, And neare when as I greatest distance keepe: These wonders loue doth worke, but yet I finde That loue wants power to make my Mistres kinde. Sonnet VIII. I lou'd, was loued, and ioy'd in content, Our soules did surfet on the sweets of loue; While equall heat our hearts affections lent, Th' one th' other to content did proue. Thus 'boue the pitch of other haplesse wights, Whose sweets are suncke still in a sea of sowres, Our hearts swam in the depth of deare delights, Pleasures seeme paines, not equalizing ours. But loue's not loue, wherein are no disasters, Time try'd my trust was by my loue betray'd, And she (for state) had got for me some tasters, Which louers like not, so our loue decay'd. Though she lou'd others; hereof I may boast, I lou'd, was loued chastely first and most. Sonnet IX. Louer, Mistresse. L. Hence loose alluring lookes, no more of Loue, no more thy seeming vertues shal deceiue me. M. Come, come my dearest, speak not thus to proue How well I loue; thou think'st it doth not grieue me. L. Thy beautie was a bait to drawe mine eye. M. And with thy blinke my heart was set on fire. L. I thought to finde a suting soule in thee. M. Thy loue's the limit that bounds my desire. L. Thy loosenesse makes my loue's date now expire. M. Where then thy vowes? L. Gone with thy seeming worth. M. And made to me? L. No, vertue brought them forth. Which failing now no fewell feeds my fire. M. My hearts the harbour where thy hopes must stay. L. Where grounds not good, an anchor dregs away. Song III. I can loue, and loue intirely, And can proue a constant friend: But I must be lou'd as dearely, And as truly to the end: For her loue no sooner slaketh, But my fancie farwell taketh. I cannot indure delaying, I must haue her quickly won: Be she nice (though not denaying) By her leaue I then haue done: For I am not yet at leasure, To dwine for a doubtfull pleasure. My eies shall not still be wailing, Where I'm answered with neglect: My hurt is not at her hailing, Who my paine doth not respect: He's a foole that seekes relieuing, From her glories in his grieuing With beautie I will not be blinded, Yet I will none foule affect: With wealth I will not be winded, If in behauiour be defect; Beautie stained such loue dieth, Wealth decayed such loue flieth. Gifts doe good, yet he is silly That therein expendeth store, If he win not, tell me, will he Not be meetly mock'd therefore? It is better to be keeping Then to sowe not sure of reaping. As I would not words be waring Where there's no assurance had; So I would not gifts be sparing, Where I wooe and know shall wed. Giuing so is no decreasing, I haue hers in her possessing. Be she rich, and faire, and gained; If I ficklenesse doe finde, My desires are quickly wained, I can steere with other winde. For Vertue, I haue vow'd to chuse her, When that failes I will refuse her. Song IIII. Now doe the Birds in their warbling words welcome the yeare; While sugred notes they chirrup th' row their throats, To win a pheare: Sweetly they breath the wanton loue That Nature in them warmes: And each to gaine a Mate doth proue, With sweet inchanting charmes. He sweetly sings, and staies the nimble wings Of her in th' aire, She houering staies, to heare his louing laies Which wooe her there: She becomes willing, heares him wooe, giues eare vnto his song: And doth as Nature taught her doe, Yeelds, su'd vnto not long. But CÅlia staies, she feeds me with delaies, Heares not my mone: She knowes the smart in time will kill my heart to liue alone: Learne of the birds to chuse thee a pheare, But not like them to range: They haue their mate but for a yeare, But sweet, let's neuer change. The Turtle-doue let's imitate in loue, That still loues one: Deare doe not stay, youth quickly flies away, Then desir's gone. Loue is kindest, and hath most length, The kisses are most sweet, When it's inioy'd in heat of strength, Where like affections meet: Sonnet X. As doth Solsequium louer of the light, When Sol is absent locke her golden leaues, And sealed mournes, till it regaine his sight, Whose flaming raies soone counteruailes it's griefes. Far more thy absence me of rest bereaues. The hoped-Morne the Marigold doth cherish: But when my Sunne this blest horizon leaues, Hopelesse of light my ioyes in darknesse perish. Stay then my Sunne, make this thy Zodiacke, And moue, but make my armes to be the sphere: Make me thy West, with me thy lodging take, Moue to my brest, and make thy setting there. So shall be more glad of thy decline, Then PhÅbus-floure when he begins to shine. Song V. Seruant farwell; is this my hire, Doe my deserts no more require? No, doe not thinke to cheat me so, I will haue more yet ere you goe. Thy lou'd-Idea I'le arrest, And it imprison in my brest: In sad conceit it there shall lie, My iealous loue shall keepe the key. The drops my wounded heart shall bleed, Shall be food whereon it shall feed: The teares are shed when I doe thinke On thee, shall be it's only drinke. My restlesse thoughts shall range about, My cares shall care it come not out: And when these faile their watch to keepe, I'le chaine it fast in leaden sleepe. Nor thinke it euer shall part thence, Or that I will with it dispence: Thy loue alone can me auaile, Thy selfe alone I'le take for baile. Sonnet XI. Sweet is the Rose and faire, yet who the same Would pluck, may wound his finger with the brier, So sweet, so faire is my beloued Dame: Her darting eie wounds those that come her neere. They both are faire, both sweet, they both make smart; The rose the finger; CÃ¦lia the heart. Sonnet XII. My loue is such as I can ne're obtaine, Nor can I thinke which way to ease my paine: If I conceal't, theres no hope of reliefe, If I bewrai't, scorne will increase my griefe. Griefe hid brings soonest death, there help remains, Reueal'd life lingers, languishing in paines: Since my loues hopelesse, and without reliefe, I scorne her scorne should adde vnto my griefe: Therefore my thoughts I'le burie as they rise, And smother in my soule my infant cries: So hasten death: then if she chance to heare I died for loue of her I held too deare, And say t'was pittie with her heauenly breath, That shall requite me well euen after death. Sonnet XIII. When I doe loue, let me a mistris finde, Whose hard repulse doth me smal hope procure, Not yeelding yeelding-no: the constant minde Is long in gaining, but obtain'd is sure: The Diamond is cut with care and paines, But being cut, it still one forme retaines. That which is lightly got is valued least, âThe memorie of care sweetens content: Most feelingly we doe those pleasures taste, That are procur'd with paine, made known by want: It's better neuer any comfort taste, Then rellish sorrowes by the pleasures past. Song VI. A maid me lou'd, her loue I not respected, Shee mourn'd, she sign'd, nay su'd, yet I neglected: Too late too late, alas I now repent, For Cupid with her loue hath me infected. As erst He hers, so loue my heart now burneth, As I at her, she laughes at me that mourneth: Too late too late, alas, I now repent, Since her disdained loue to hatred turneth. On her alone doth health and hope rely, Yet still she scornes and doth me loue deny, Too late, too late, alas I now repent, Since she ioyes in my death, I for her die. Sonnet XIV. The louing Lizard takes so much delight To looke vpon the face of liuing man, As it seemes for to feed euen by the sight, And liues by lookes which it inioyeth than. But when that pleasing obiect leaues the place, (As wanting that which only did it cherish) It fainting dies, depriuall of that face The onely cause is why it so doth perish. Euen so my CÃ¦lia's loue hath lately proued, It ioyd, it liu'd to me, while I was eied It vigorous was, but I from sight remoued, It fainted, soone grew weake, and quickly died. My CÃ¦lia's loue thus prou'd a Lizard right, I seene, it liued; It di'd I out of sight. A Paradox. I loue my Loue the better she doth change, (Which some may chance hold a position strange) Women's extreme, if loue were still at height, Like euer shining sunne 'tcould not delight. A still-fruition duls; respit releeues: An intermission still new rellish giues. A changing-fauour puffes not vp with pride, Because vncertaine how long 't shall abide. It lets not languish with a long disdaine, No sooner eb'd but it doth flow againe. Then in my turne I shall be well respected, Late fauorits as much shall be neglected. I loue her 'cause shee's woman (if her minde Not wauering were, she were none of that kinde) The more shees woman I the more doe loue her, The more vnconstant, I more woman proue her. The more a woman's of a womans minde, The better, (best degener least from kinde:) The most inconstant they degener least, The most inconstant therefore are the best. The best I vow'd to loue, therefore none els I'le loue but whose vnconstancy excels. Sonnet XV. Whilst fortune's fondlings d?dled in her lap, Swim in the depth of vndeseru'd desires, Carelesse of crosse vnmindfull of mishap, Still floating higher then their hope aspires: Poore haplesse I, whose hopes soard lately higher, (With promise-pens plum'd w?? nere faile in flight) Defer'd, disdain'd, hartlesse dares not draw nigh her, My wearied wandring wing can no where light. And Fortune still the more to shew her spight, The nearer that my hope seemes to obtaine, With vnexpected crosses curbes them quite, W?? nigh gain'd good makes me but taste my pain. Yet fickle Fortune I disdaine thy frowne: âBase mindes thou maist, but neuer braue cast downe. Sonnet XVI. They Fortune much do wrong that cal her blind; And that she knowes not how to giue her gifts; That she's vnconstant, wauering as the wind, Which in a minute many corners shifts. That she delights in nought but turning states, The misers raising; mighty ones o'rethrowing, She loues not long, and long she neuer hates, At randome (as it lights) her gifts bestowing. If she were blinde, some gift I might haue got By chance: if louing chance I had rise higher, If long to loue or hate inclining not I once had found her friend; but I will free her. She sees, can giue, is constant, long can hate, Too well I know't, she still hath crost my state. Sonnet XVII. When I consider well how Cupid kinde First did inflame my heart with louing fires, And did remoue the quiet of my minde, And for it plac'd wake-rife (yet deare) desires: And how the friend I truely did affect With like sincerity repaid my loue: How we did striue each other to respect, And no contention else did euer proue: How that our soules so nearely sympathiz'd, We oft did thinke and oft did dreame the same, What one approu'd the other highly priz'd, What one dislik'd the others heart did blame. O how thy enuy Fortune makes me wonder, Whom Loue so ioynd, thou shouldst haue kept asunder. Song VII. Horac: Car: lib. 3, Ode 9. ad Lydiam. Ho: Whilst I was welcome, &amp; thy chiefe delight, And no youth else more wishedly did bring His armes about thy necke so louely white, I liu'd more happie then the Persian King. Ly: whilst thou didst not burn with the loue of other, And Lydia no lesse grace then Cloe found: Lydia was famouser then any other; Liu'd more then Roman Ilia renoun'd. Ho: But Thracian Cloe now commandeth me, Skild in sweet Musicke cunning on the Lute: For whom I would not be afeard to die, To saue her life, so that my death could do't. Ly: Calais Ornith's sonne with louing fire Burnes me, and I affect him with like strife: For whom I willingly would twice expire, If so the Fates would spare my younglings life. Ho: What if our ancient loue should come about, And ioyne vs iarring with a lasting chaine: Were faire-hair'd Cloe fra my hart cast out, And cast off Lydia receiu'd againe. Ly: Though Calais fairer then a blazing starre, Lighter then fleeting Corke although you be: And then the Adrian sea more teastie farre, With thee I'd loue to liue and willing die. Sonnet XVIII. Why dost thou doubt (deare CÃ¦lia) that my loue, (Which beautie bred, and vertue stil doth nourish) That any other obiect can remoue? Or faint with time? but still more freshly flourish: No, know thy Beautie is of such a force, The Fancie cannot flit that's with it taken: Thy vertue's such my heart doth hate diuorce From thy sweet loue, which nere shall be forsaken. So setled is my soule in this resolue, That first the starres from crystall skie shall fall: The heauens shall lose their influence, dissolue, To the old Chaos shall be turn'd this all, Ere I from thee deare CÃ¦lia remoue, My true, my constant, and my sincere loue. Song VIII. When curious Nature did her cunning trie, In framing of this faire terrestriall round: Her workmanship the more to beautifie With chang'd varietie made it abound, And oft did place a plot of fertile ground Fraught with delights, nie to a barren soile, To make the best seeme better by a foile. Thus first were made by Thames the motly-meads, Wearing the liuery of the Summers Queene: Whose flourie robe ore them she freely spreads, With colours more then are in Iris seene, And all the ground and hemme of grassie greene, Whereon the silly sheepe doe fearelesse feed, While on a banke the shepheard tunes his reed. Next shadie groues where Delia hunteth oft, And light-foot Fairies tripping still doe haunt: There mirthfull Muses raise sweet notes aloft, And wanton birds their chaste loues cheerely chant, There no delightfull pleasure ere doth want; There Syluian with his Satyres doth remaine, There Nymphs doe loue and are belou'd againe. This place doth seeme an earthly Paradise, Where on fit obiect euery sense may feed; And fild with dainties that doe thence arise, Of superfluitie helpe others need; Yet no satietie that store doth breed. For when the sense nigh surfets on delight, New obiects the duld-appetite doe wher. This place I say doth border on a plaine, Which Step-dame Nature seemes t'haue made in scorne, Where hungrie husbandmen haue toild in vaine, And with the share the barren soile haue torne; Nor did they rest till rise of ruddie Morne: Yet when was come the haruest of their hopes, They for their gaine doe gather grainlesse crops. It seemes of staru'd Sterilitie the seat, Where barren downes doe it inuiron round: Whose parched tops in Summer are not wet, And only are with snow in winter crown'd, Only with barenesse they doe still abound; Or if on some of them we roughnesse finde, It's tawnie-heath badge of the barren rinde. In midst of these stands Croydon cloath'd in blacke, In a low bottome sinke of all these hills: And is receipt of all the durtie wracke, Which from their tops still in abundance trils, The vnpau'd lanes with muddie mire it fills. If one shower fall, or if that blessing stay, You may well smell, but neuer see your way. For neuer doth the flowre-perfumed Aire, Which steals choice sweets from other blessed fields, With panting breast take any resting there: Nor of that prey a portion to it yeelds, For those harsh hills his comming either shields, Or else his breath infected with their kisses, Cannot inrich it with his fragrant blisses. And those who there inhabit suting well With such a place doe either Nigro's seeme, Or harbingers for Pluto Prince of hell, Or his fire-beaters one might rightly deeme, Their sight would make a soule of hell to dreame, Besmeard with sut, and breathing pitchie smoake, Which (saue themselues) a liuing wight would choke. These with the demi-gods still disagreeing, (As vice with vertue euer is at iarre) With all who in the pleasant woods haue being Doe vndertake an euerlasting warre, Cuts downe their groues, and often doe them skarre, And in a close-pent fire their arbours burne, While as the Muses can doe nought but mourne. The other Syluans with their sight affrighted, Doe flee the place whereas these clues resort, Shunning the pleasures which them erst delighted, When they behold these groomes of Pluto's court, While they doe take their spoiles and count it sport To spoile these dainties that them so delighted, And see them with their vgly shapes affrighted. To all proud dames I wish no greater hell, Who doe disdaine of chastly profered loue, Then to that place confin'd there euer dwel; That place their prides deare price might iustly proue: For if (which God forbid) my deare should moue Me not come nie her for to passe my troth, Place her but there and I shall keepe mine oath. Sonnet XIX. Fond doubtfull Hope, Reason-deprau'd, false fires, Deceiuing thoghts &amp; plaints prouing but wind: Ill grounded griefe, springing from vaine desires, Haue led me in a maze of error blinde. But Thou whose eie surueies this earthly ball, And sees our actions ere they be begunne: High and Eternall mouer of this all. Whose mercie doth mans misery fore-runne. Now in the right way turne my wandring heart, Teach me to be bid farewell to fond desire. Deceiuing Error and Uaine-ioy depart, With thy all-quickning spirit my soule inspire. Grant Lord I may redeeme my mis-spent time, And (if I sing) to thee I praise may chime. Song IX. O how my sin-clogd-soule would soare aloft, And scale the crystall-skie to seeke remed, But that foule Sinne (wherewith I staine it oft, Makes it to sinke through doubt of my misdeed: In scroule of guilty-conscience I reed The rufull legend of my passed life, The thought whereof maketh my heart to bleed, Finding my foule offences are so rife. Feare makes me faint to finde such, and so many As there are ranked in that ragged roule: Despair: doth say there was nere such in any, Weeping cannot them wash nor heart condole. Gods wrath and Iustice sheweth to my soule, For euery sinne that must be satisfi'd: What will become of me with such a scroule, Since Death the wage of sinne is sure decreed. Neuer to blooming-virgin truest Mirror, Did represent beauty with more delight Then subtill Sathan with affrighting-terror, My guiltinesse doth shew me with despight. What erst as trifles seemed to my sight Now are death-worthy; my late-liking sin Is now displeasing; and would barre me quite All hope of helpe, since such I wallowed in. Hope to my heart my Sauiour doth present, With all his Passions prou'd for sinners sake, Yet none but hee that doth from heart repent, Can vse of that great satisfaction make: I hold of him by a firme-faith must take, And all his sufferings to my selfe applie: If penitence want not, nor Faith be weake, Of Heauen I know he cannot me denie. But where's Repentance for so foule a staine? Why stint you Eies continually to shower? The humid liquor of your moistning-raine Doth make to sprout the faire Repenting-flower. Giue teares no respite, nor no truce an houre, And since with wandring-lookes you did offend: With still-distilling-drops your Canker skowre, With coming-care your passed scapes amend. Ah haplesse heart, why rend'st not with remorse? For quicke conceiuing what the flesh hath wrought: Hast thou (depraued) bent to ill thy force? And knowes thy Maker thy most secret thought? And wilt thou yet be negligent in ought Thee may reclame, or with contrition wound? Bleed, bleed to think that who so deare thee bought, Thou'st crucifi'd againe, with thornes hast crown'd. And thou fraile flesh shame not now to begin, Thee to submit to the reforming spirit: Thinke of the by-waies thou hast wandred in, Which lead to hell and death, deserued merit. Why art Thou proud? Thou canst not heauen inherit, Lie downe in dust, doe no workes of thine owne, But what the soule commands oh willing heare it, By thy obedience let its rule be knowne. But Lord without thy sweet assisting grace, I can doe nought, all my attempts are vaine: I cannot come without thou call alas, Grant me this grace, and bring me home againe; Let thy blest Spirit, Faith, Hope, and Loue remaine Still in my soule: the flesh, the world and Deuill, Depriue of power; let them no more raigne, Or if they tempt, deliuer me from euill. Thou'rt not desirous that a sinner die, But that He may repent his sinnes and liue: Thou bidst the heauie laden come to thee, And Thou wilt ease the weight that doth him grieue. Thou bidst him knocke, and thou wilt ope the leaue Of that strict gate that leadeth vnto blisse; Grant I repent, doe come, doe knocke, receaue Life, Lightning, entrance where no anguish is. Lord grant me grace my comming-daies to number, To wisdome then I shall my heart applie: Rowse me out of this lethargie and slumber, Of sinne and slouth wherein I now doe lie. Sinners (that seeing) soone shall draw thee nie, Sh?ning base thoughts, their soules to thee shall raise, And with a sweet consort shall pierce the skies, Of thy great mercie, and eternall praise. Sonnet XX. O Father-God who by thy word didst make The Azurd-vault, and all the host of heauen, The hils, vales, plaines, fresh streams, &amp; brinie lake, And vnto each inhabitants hast giuen: O Word which (for our sakes) did'st flesh become, With sinners to purge sinne had'st habitation: Crimeles accus'd, condemn'd, the crosse thy doome, Suffredst Death, Buriall, rose for our saluation. O Holy Ghost which dost from both proceed, Sweet soule-inspiring-spirit with peace and loue: Comfort to all, cast downe for sinfull deed, Lessening their woes with hoyes of Heauen aboue. O Triuall-one, one God and Persons three, Reforme my waies, and draw me vnto Thee. FINIS.</field>
