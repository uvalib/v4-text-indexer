[Prologus.] And as I passid in my preiere Ã¾er prestis were at messe, In a blessid borugh Ã¾at Bristow is named, In a temple of Ã¾? trinite Ã¾? toune euen amyddis, That Cristis Chirche is cleped amonge Ã¾e comune peple, Sodeynly Ã¾er sourdid selcouÃ¾? Ã¾ingis, A grett wondir to wyse men as it well my?th, And dowtes for to deme for drede comynge after. So sore were Ã¾e sawis of bothe two sidis, Of Richard Ã¾at regned so riche and so noble, That wyle he werrid be west on Ã¾? wilde Yrisshe, Henrri was entrid on Ã¾e est half, Whom all Ã¾? londe loued in lengÃ¾? and in brede, And rosse with him rapely to ri?tyn his wronge, For he shullde hem serue of Ã¾e same after. Thus tales me troblid for Ã¾ey trewe where, And amarride my mynde rith moche and my wittis eke: For it passid my parceit and my preifis also, How so wondirffull werkis wolde haue an ende. But in sothe whan Ã¾ey sembled some dede repeute, As knowyn is in cumpas of Cristen londis, That rewthe was, if reson ne had reffourmed The myssecheff &amp; Ã¾? mysserule Ã¾at men Ã¾o in endurid. I had pete of his passion Ã¾at prince was of Walis, And eke oure crouned kynge till Crist wol[de] no lenger; And as a [liage] to his [lord] Ã¾ou? I lite hade, All myn hoole herte was his while he in helthe regnid. And for I [wuste] not witterly what shulde fall, Whedir God wolde [g]eue him grace sone to amende, To be oure gioure a[g]eyn or graunte it anoÃ¾er, This made me to muse many tyme and ofte, For to written him a writte to wissen him better, And to meuve him of mysserewle his mynde to reffresshe For to [preie] Ã¾? prynce Ã¾at paradise made, To fullfill him with feith and fortune aboue, And not to grucchen a grott a?eine Godis sonde, But mekely to suffre what-so him sente were. And ?if him list to loke a leef oÃ¾er tweyne, That made is to mende him of his myssededis, And to kepe him in confforte in Crist and nou?t ellis, I wolde be gladde Ã¾at his gost my?te glade be my wordis, And grame if it greued him be God Ã¾at me bou?te! And euery Cristen kyng Ã¾at ony [croune] bereth, So he were lerned on Ã¾e langage my lyff durst I wedde, ?if he waite well Ã¾e wordis and so werche Ã¾er-after, [Ther nys no gouernour on Ã¾? grounde ne sholde gye him Ã¾? better,] For all is tresour of Ã¾? trinite Ã¾at turneth men to gode. And as my body &amp; my beste oute to be my liegis, So rithffully be reson my rede shuld also, For to conceill, and I cou?the my kyng and Ã¾e lordis; And Ã¾er-for I [fondyd] with all my fyue wyttis To traueile on Ã¾is tretis to teche men Ã¾er-after To be war of wylffulnesse lest wondris arise. And if it happe to ?oure honde beholde Ã¾? book onys, And redeth on him redely rewis an hundrid, And if ?e sauere sum-dell se it forth ouere, For reson is no repreff be Ã¾e rode of Chester! And if ?e fynde fables or foly Ã¾er amonge, Or ony fantasie yffeyned Ã¾at no frute is in, Lete ?oure conceill corette it and clerkis to-gedyr, And amende Ã¾at ys amysse and make it more better: For ?it it is secrette and so it shall lenger, Tyll wyser wittis han waytid it ouere, That it be lore laweffull and lusty to here. For witterly, my will is Ã¾at it well liked ?ou and all ?ouris and yonge men leueste, To be-nyme hem her noyes Ã¾at neweth hem ofte. For and Ã¾ey mvse Ã¾eron to Ã¾e myddwardis, They shall fele fawtis foure score and odde, That yough[th]e weneth alwey Ã¾at it be witt euere. And Ã¾ou? Ã¾at elde opyn it oÃ¾er-while amonge, And poure on it preuyly and preue it well after, And constrewe ich clause with Ã¾? culorum, It shulde not apeire hem a peere a prynce Ã¾ou? he were, Ne harme noÃ¾er hurte Ã¾e hyghest of Ã¾e rewme, But to holde him in hele and helpe all his frendis. And if ony word write be Ã¾at wrothe make myghte My souereyne, Ã¾at suget I shulde to be, I put me in his power and preie him, of grace, To take Ã¾? entent of my trouÃ¾? Ã¾at thou?te non ylle, For to wrath no wyght be my wyll neuere, As my soule be saff from synne at myn ende. Ã? story is of non estate Ã¾at stryuen with her lustus, But Ã¾o Ã¾at folwyn her flessh and here frelle Ã¾ou?tis; So if my conceyll be clere I can saie no more, But ho be greued in his gost gouerne him better, And blame not Ã¾e berne Ã¾at Ã¾e book made, But Ã¾e wickyd will and Ã¾e werkis after. [Passus Primus.] Now, Richard Ã¾? redeles reweth on ?ou-self, Ãat lawelesse leddyn ?oure lyf and ?oure peple boÃ¾?; For Ã¾oru Ã¾? wyles and wronge and wast in ?oure tyme, ?e were lyghtlich ylyfte from Ã¾at ?ou leef Ã¾ou?te, And from ?oure willffull werkis ?oure will was chaungid, And rafte was ?oure riott and rest for ?oure daie? weren wikkid, Ãoru ?oure cursid conceill ?oure karis weren newed, And coueitise hath crasid ?oure croune for euere! Of alegeaunce now lerneth a lesson oÃ¾er tweyne Wher-by it standith and stablithe mosteâ By dride, or be dyntis or domes vntrewe, Or by creaunce of coyne for castes of gile, By pillynge of ?oure peple ?oure prynces to plese, Or Ã¾at ?oure wylle were wrou?te Ã¾ou? wisdom it nolde; Or be tallage of ?oure townnes without ony werre, By rewthles routus Ã¾at ryffled euere, Be preysinge of polaxis Ã¾at no pete hadde, Or be dette for Ã¾i dees deme as Ã¾ou fyndist,â Or be ledinge of lawe with loue well ytemprid. Though Ã¾is be derklich endited for a dull nolle, Miche nede is it not to mwse Ã¾er-on, For as mad as I am Ã¾ou? I litill kunne, I cowde it discryue in a fewe wordys; For legiance without loue litill Ã¾inge availith. But graceles gostis gylours of hem-self, That neuere had [harmesse] ne hayle-schouris, But walwed in her willis forweyned in here youthe, Ãey sawe no manere si?th saff solas and ese, And cowde no mysse amende whan mysscheff was vp, But sorwed for her lustus of lordsch[i]pe Ã¾ey hadde, And neuere for her trespas oo tere wolde Ã¾ey lete. ?e come to ?oure kyngdom er ?e ?oure-self knewe, Crouned with a croune Ã¾at kyng vnder heuene Mi?te not a better haue bou?te, as I trowe; So full was it filled with vertus stones, With perlis of pris to punnysshe Ã¾? wrongis, With rubies rede Ã¾? ri?th for to deme, With gemmes and juellis joyned to-gedir, And pees amonge Ã¾? peple for peyne of Ã¾i lawis. It was full goodeliche ygraue with gold al abou?te; The braunchis aboue boren grett charge; With diamauntis derue y-douutid of all That wroute ony wrake within or withoute; With lewte and loue yloke to Ã¾i peeris, And sapheris swete Ã¾at sou?te all wrongis, Ypouudride wyth pete Ã¾er it be ou?te, And traylid with trouÃ¾? and treste al aboute; For ony cristen kynge a croune well ymakyd. But where Ã¾is croune bicome a clerk were Ã¾at wuste; But so as I can declare it I thenke, And nempne no name; but Ã¾o Ã¾at nest were, Full preuyly Ã¾ey pluckud Ã¾y power awey, And reden with realte ?oure rewme Ã¾oru-oute, And as tyrauntis, of tiliers token what hem liste, And paide hem on her pannes whan her penyes lacked. For non of ?oure peple durste pleyne of here wrongis, For drede of ?oure dukys &amp; of here double harmes. Men my?tten as well haue hun[t]yd an hare with a tabre As aske ony mendis for Ã¾at Ã¾ei mysdede, Or of ony of her men Ã¾ou? men wulde plete, For all was felawis and felawschepe Ã¾at ?e with ferde, And no soule persone to punnyshe Ã¾e wrongis; And Ã¾at maddid Ã¾i men as Ã¾ei nede muste. For wo, Ã¾ey ne wuste to whom for to pleyne. For, as it is said by elderne dawis, âÃer gromes and Ã¾e goodmen beth all eliche grette, Woll wo beth Ã¾e wones and all Ã¾at woneth Ã¾er-in!â Ãey ladde ?ou with loue Ã¾at ?oure lawe dradde To deme ?oure dukys myssdedis so derue Ã¾ei were. Thus was ?oure croune crasid till he was cast newe, Ãoru partninge of ?oure powere to ?oure paragals. Thus lacchide Ã¾ey with laughinge and lourid longe after, But frist sawe Ã¾ey it not ne youre-self noÃ¾er; For all was wisliche ywrou?te as ?oure witte demed, And no fauutis yffounde till fortune aperid. But had ?oure croune be kepte Ã¾at comons it wiste, Ãer nadde morder ne mysscheff be amonge Ã¾? grette. Thus ?oure cautell to Ã¾? comoune hath combred ?ou all, That, but if God helpe ?oure heruest is ynne. Wytteth it not ?oure conceill but wyte[t]h it more ?oure-self, The fortune Ã¾at fallyn is to feitheles peple; And wayte well my wordis and wrappe hem to-gedir, And constrwe [clerlie] Ã¾? clause in Ã¾in herte Of maters Ã¾at I thenke to meve for Ã¾e best For kyngis and kayseris comynge here-after. Whane ?e were sette in ?oure se as a sir aughte, Ther carpinge comynliche of conceill arisith, The cheuyteyns cheef Ã¾at ?e chesse euere, Weren all to yonge of ?eris to yeme swyche a rewme; OÃ¾er hobbis ?e hadden of Hurlewaynis kynne, Reffusynge Ã¾e reule of realles kynde. And whane ?oure conceill i-knewe ?e come so at ones For to leue on her lore and be led be hem, For drede Ã¾at Ã¾ey had of demynge Ã¾er-after, And for curinge of hem-self cried on ?ou euere, For to hente hele of her owen greues, More Ã¾an for wurschepe Ã¾at Ã¾ey to ?ou owed. Ãey made ?ou to leue Ã¾at regne ?e ne my?te Withoute busshinge adoun of all ?oure best frendis, Be a fals colour her caris to wayve, And to holde hem in hele if it happe my?te. For trostiÃ¾ rith treuly and in no tale better, All Ã¾at Ã¾ey moued or mynged in Ã¾at mater Was to be sure of hem-self and siris to ben y-callid; For Ã¾at was all her werchinge in worde and in dede. But had ?e do duly and as a duke oughte, Ã? frist Ã¾at ?ou formed to Ã¾at fals dede, He shulde haue hadde hongynge on hie on Ã¾? forckis, Ãou? ?oure brother y-born had be Ã¾? same. Than wolde oÃ¾er boynardis haue ben abasshyd To haue meved ?ou to ony maters Ã¾at myssheff had ben ynne. But for ?e cleued to knavis in Ã¾is cas I avowe, Ãat boldid Ã¾i burnes to belde vppon sorowe, And stirid ?ou stouttely till ?e stombled all. Passus secundus. But moche now me merueilith and well may I in sothe, Of ?oure large leuerey to leodis abou?te, That ?e so goodliche [g]af but if gile letted, As hertis y-heedyd and hornyd of kynde, So ryff as Ã¾ey ronne ?oure rewme Ã¾oru-oute, That non at ?oure nede ?oure name wolde nempne In fersnesse ne in foltheed but faste fle awayward; And some stode astonyed and stared for drede, For eye of Ã¾e egle Ã¾at oure helpe brouute. And also in sothe Ã¾e seson was paste For hertis yheedid so hy and so noble To make ony myrthe for mowtynge Ã¾at nyghed. That bawtid ?oure bestis of here bolde chere; Ãey seuerid and sondrid for somere hem faylid, And flowen in-to forest and feldis abou?te, All Ã¾e hoole herde Ã¾at helde so [to]-gedir; But ?et Ã¾ey had hornes half ?ere after. Now liste me to lerne ho me lere coude, What kynnes conceyll Ã¾at Ã¾? kyng had, Or meued him most to merke his liegis, Or serue hem with signes Ã¾at swarmed so thikke Ãoru-oute his lond in lengÃ¾? and in brede, Ãat ho-so had hobblid Ã¾oru holtes and tounes, Or y-passid Ã¾? patthis Ã¾er Ã¾e prynce dwellyd, [Of] hertis or hyndis on hassellis brestis, Or some lordis leuere Ã¾at Ã¾? lawe stried, He shulde haue y-mette mo Ã¾an ynowe. For Ã¾ey acombrede Ã¾? contre and many curse seruid, And carped to Ã¾e comounes with Ã¾? kyngys mouÃ¾?, Or with Ã¾? lordis Ã¾er Ã¾ey belefte were, That no renke shulde rise reson to schewe. Ãey plucked Ã¾e plomayle from Ã¾? pore skynnes, And schewed her signes for men shulde drede To axe ony mendis for her mys-dedis. Thus leuere? ouere-loked ?oure liegis ichonne; For Ã¾o Ã¾at had hertis on hie on her brestis, For Ã¾e more partie I may well avowe, Ãey bare hem Ã¾e bolder for her gay broches, And busshid with her brestis and bare adoun Ã¾? pouere Liages Ã¾at loued ?ou Ã¾e lesse for her yuell dedis. So, trouthe to telle as toune-men said, For on Ã¾at ?e merkyd ?e myssed ten schore Of homeliche hertis Ã¾at Ã¾? harme hente. Thane was it foly in feith, as me thynketh, To sette siluer in signes Ã¾at of nou?t serued. I not what ?ou eylid but if it ese were; For frist at ?oure anoyntynge alle were ?oure owen, Bothe hertis and hyndis and helde of non oÃ¾er; No lede of ?oure lond but as a liege aughte, Ty[l] ?e, of ?oure dulnesse deseueraunce made Ãoru ?oure side signes Ã¾at shente all Ã¾? browet, And cast adoun Ã¾? crokk Ã¾? colys amyd. ?it am I lewde and litill good schewe To coueyte knowliche of kyngis wittis, Or wilne to witte [what] was Ã¾? mevynge That [ladde] ?ou to lykynge ?oure liegis to merke, Ãat loued ?ou full lelly or leuere? beg[a]nne, And as redy to ride or renne at ?oure heste As wyghte myghte wilne wonnynge vppon erthe, Tyll leuere? hem lette and lordyns wrongis, As ?oure-self fonde well whane fortune ?ou [fayled]. For whan ?e list to lene to ?oure owen lymes, Ãey were so feble and feynte for fau?te of ?oure lawe, And so [wankel] and wayke wexe in Ã¾e hammes Ãat Ã¾ey had no myghte to amende ?oure greues Ne to bere byrthen ?oure banere to helpe. But it longith to no liegeman his lord to anoye NoÃ¾er in werk ne in word but if his witt faile. âNo, redely,â quod Reson âÃ¾at reule I alowe: Displese not Ã¾i demer in dede ne in wordis But if Ã¾? liste for to lede Ã¾i lyf in dissese. But ?if God haue grauntyd Ã¾e grace for to knowe Ony manere mysscheff Ã¾at my?tte be amendyd, Schewe Ã¾at to Ã¾i souereyne to schelde him from harmes; For and he be blessid Ã¾? better Ã¾? betydyth In tyme for to telle him for Ã¾i trewe herte.â Now for to telle trouthe Ã¾us Ã¾an me thynketh, That no manere meyntenour shulde merkis bere, Ne haue lordis leuere Ã¾e lawe to apeire, NeiÃ¾er bragger ne boster for no breme wordis. But ho-so had kunnynge and conscience bothe To stonde vnstombled and stronge in his wittis, Lele in his leuynge leuyd be his owen, Ãat no manere mede shulde make him wrye, For to trien a trouthe be-twynne two sidis, And lette for no lordsche[p] Ã¾? lawe to susteyne Whane Ã¾? pore pleyned Ã¾at put were to wrongis, And I were of conceill by Crist Ã¾at me bou?te, He shuld haue a signe and sum-what be ?ere For to kepe his contre in quiete and in reste. This were a good grounde so me God helpe! And a trewe tente to take and to ?eue, [For] ony lord of this londe Ã¾at leuere? vsith. But how the gayes han y-gon God wotte Ã¾? sothe Amonge my?tffull men alle Ã¾ese many ?eris; And whedir Ã¾? grou[n]de of [g]ifte were good oÃ¾er ille, Trouthe haÃ¾? determyned Ã¾? tente to Ã¾e ende, And reson hath rehersid Ã¾e resceyte of all. ?it I trowe ?oure entente at Ã¾? frist tyme Was, as I wene, ?if I well thenke in multitude of peple, That ?e were Ã¾? more my?tier for Ã¾e many signes Ãat ?e and ?oure seruauntis abou?te so thikke sowid; And Ã¾at Ã¾ey were more tristi and trewer Ã¾an oÃ¾er To loue ?ou for Ã¾? leuere Ã¾at legaunce stroied; Or ellis for a skylle Ã¾at skathed ?oure-self, Ãat comounes of contre [in] costis abou?te Sholde knowe be hir quentise Ã¾at Ã¾? kyng loued hem For her priuy prynte passinge anoÃ¾er. ?if Ã¾at was ?oure purpos it passith my wittis To deme discrecion of ?oure well-doynge. Ãus were ?e disceyued Ã¾oru ?oure duble hertis, Ãat neuere weren to truste so God saue my soule! But had Ã¾e good greehonde be not agreued, But cherischid as a cheffeteyne and cheff of ?oure lese, ?e hadde had hertis ynowe at ?oure wille to go and to ride. And also in serteyne Ã¾? soÃ¾? for to telle, I wondir not hyly Ã¾ou? heed-dere [you] failid; For litill on ?oure lyf Ã¾e list for to rewe On rascaile Ã¾at rorid with ribbis so lene, For fau?te of her fode Ã¾at flateris stelen, And euere with here wylis &amp; wast ofte Ã¾ey hem anoyed, Ãat pouerte hem prickid full preuyliche to pleyne, But where, Ã¾ey ne wyste ne ho it wolde amende. Ãus ?e derid hem vnduly with droppis of anger, And stonyed hem with stormes Ã¾at stynted neuere, But plucked and pulled hem anon to Ã¾e skynnes, Ãat Ã¾e fresinge frost freted to here hertis. So whanne ?oure hauntelere-dere where all ytakyn, Was non of Ã¾e rasskayle aredy full growe To bere ony breme heed as a best aughte, So wyntris wedir hem wessh with Ã¾? snowis, With many derke mystis Ã¾at maddid her eyne. For well mowe ?e wyttyn &amp; so mowe we all, Ãat harde is Ã¾? somer Ã¾er sonne schyneth neuere. ?e fostrid and fodid a fewe of Ã¾e best, And leyde on hem lordschipe a leyne vppon oÃ¾er, And bereued Ã¾e raskall Ã¾at rith wolde Ã¾ei hadde, And knewe not Ã¾? caris ne cursis Ã¾at walkyd; But mesure is a meri mene Ã¾ou? men moche yerne: Ãus [rend] be Ã¾e rotus ?oure raskall endurid, Tyll Ã¾e blessid bredd brodid his wyngis To couere hem from colde as his kynde wolde. Rith as Ã¾? hous-hennes vppon londe hacchen And cherichen her chekonys fro chele of Ã¾? wynter, Ryth so Ã¾? hende egle Ã¾?

Thus baterid Ã¾is bred on busshes abou?te, And gaderid gomes on grene Ã¾er as Ã¾ey walkyd, Ã¾at all Ã¾? schroff and schroup sondrid from oÃ¾er. He mellid so Ã¾e matall with Ã¾? hand-[melle] That [Ã¾ey] lost lemes Ã¾? leuest Ã¾at Ã¾ey had. Thus foulyd Ã¾is faukyn on fyldis abou?te, And cau?te of Ã¾e kuyttis a cartffull at ones, That rentis and robis with raveyn euere lau?te. ?it was not Ã¾? fawcon full fed at his likynge, For it cam him not of kynde kytes to loue. Than bated he boldeliche as a brid wolde, To plewme on his pray Ã¾? pol fro Ã¾? nekk; But Ã¾? blernyed boynard Ã¾at his bagg stall, Where purraile-is pulter was pynnyd full ofte, Made Ã¾e fawcon to floter and flussh for anger That Ã¾? boy [nadd] be bounde Ã¾at Ã¾e bagge kepte.

For wher-so Ã¾ey ferde be fryth or be wones, Was non of hem all Ã¾at him hide my?th, But cam with him a reclayme fro costis abou?te, And fell with her fetheris flat vppon Ã¾? erthe, As madde of her mynde and mercy be-sou?te. Ãey my?te not aschonne Ã¾? sorowe Ã¾ey had serued, So lymed leues were leyde all abou?te, And panteris preuyliche pight vppon Ã¾e grounde, With grennes of good heere Ã¾at God him-self made, Ãat where-so Ã¾ey walkid Ã¾ey waltrid dounwardis; And euere houed Ã¾? egle on hie on Ã¾? skyes, And kenned clerliche as his kynde axith, Alle Ã¾? preuy poyntis Ã¾at Ã¾? pies wrou?th. Passus Tercius. Now leue we Ã¾is beu brid till I restore, For mater Ã¾at my mynde is meved in now, That whi Ã¾e hie hertis her hele so mysside, Ãat pasture axid rith to here pure wombis, I wolle schewe as I sawe till I se better; And if I walke out of Ã¾? wey I wolle me repente.

Her kynde is to keuere if Ã¾ey cacche my?th Adders Ã¾at armen alle hende bestis; Ãoru busschis and bromes Ã¾is beste, of his kynde, Secheth and sercheth Ã¾o schrewed wormes, Ãat steleth on Ã¾? stedis to stynge hem to deth; And whanne it happeth Ã¾e herte to hente Ã¾e edder, He putyth him to peyne as his pray asketh, And fedith him on Ã¾e venym his felle to anewe, To leue at more lykynge a longe tyme after. This is [clerlie] hir kynde coltis [not] to greue, Ne to hurlle with haras ne hors well atamed, Ne to stryue with swan Ã¾ou? it sholle werre, Ne to bayten on Ã¾e bere ne bynde him noÃ¾er, Ne to wilne to woo Ã¾at were hem ny sibbe, Ne to liste for to loke Ã¾at her alie bledde; This was a?eins kynde as clerkis me tolde; And Ã¾er-for Ã¾? hertis here hele so myssid, And my?te nat passe Ã¾? poynte of her prime age.

And whane Ã¾? dame hath ydo Ã¾at to Ã¾? dede longith, And hopith for to hacche or heruest begynne, Thane cometh Ã¾er a congion with a grey cote, As not of his nolle as he Ã¾? nest made, AnoÃ¾er proud partriche and precyth to Ã¾e nest, And preuylich pirith till Ã¾? dame passe, And sesith on hir [sete] with hir softe plumes, And houeth Ã¾e eyren Ã¾at Ã¾? hue laide, And with hir corps keuereth hem till Ã¾at Ã¾ey kenne, And fostrith and fodith till fedris schewe, And cotis of kynde hem keuere all abou?te.

But Ã¾o all Ã¾? berlingis brast out at ones, As fayne [as] Ã¾? foule Ã¾at flieth on Ã¾? skyes Ãat Bosse was vnbounde and brouute to his owen.

Ãer was non of Ã¾? mene Ã¾at Ã¾ey ne merueilid moche How he cam to Ã¾e courte and was not y-knowe; But als sone as Ã¾ey wiste Ã¾at Witt was his name, And Ã¾at Ã¾e kyng knewe him not ne non of his kny?tis, He was halowid and y-huntid and y-hotte trusse, And his dwellinge ydemed a bowe-drawte from hem, And ich man y-charchid to schoppe at his croune, ?if he nyhed hem ony nere Ã¾an Ã¾ey had him nempned.

For tristith, als trewly as tyllinge us helpeth, Ãat iche rewme vndir roff of Ã¾? reyne-bowe Sholde stable and stonde be Ã¾ese Ã¾re degres: By gouerna[un]ce of grete and of good age; By styffnesse and strengthe of steeris well y-yokyd, Ãat beth my?thffull men of Ã¾e mydill age; And be laboreris of lond Ã¾at lyfflode ne fayle.

For it fallith as well to fodis of xxiiij ?eris, Or yonge men of yistirday to ?eue good redis, As becometh a kow to hoppe in a cage! It is not vnknowen to kunnynge leodis, That rewlers of rewmes around all Ã¾? erthe Were not yffoundid at Ã¾? frist tyme To leue al at likynge and lust of Ã¾? world, But to laboure on Ã¾? lawe as lewde men on plowes, And to merke meyntenour? with maces ichonne, And to strie strouters Ã¾at sterede a?eine rithis, And alle Ã¾e myssedoers Ã¾at Ã¾ey my?te fynde, To put hem in preson a peere Ã¾ou? he were; And [not] to rewle as reremys and rest on Ã¾? daies, And spende of Ã¾e spicerie more Ã¾an it nedid, Bothe wexe and wyn in wast all abou?te, With deyntes y-doublid and daunsinge to pipis, In myrthe with moppis myrrours of synne. ?it forbede I no burne to be blithe sum while; But all Ã¾inge hath tyme for to tempre glees: For caste all Ã¾? countis Ã¾at Ã¾? kyng holdith, And loke how Ã¾?se lordis loggen hem-self, And euere shall Ã¾ou fynde as fer as Ã¾ou walkiste, [Ãat] wisdom and ouere-wacche wonneth fer asundre; But whane Ã¾? gouernaunce goth Ã¾us with Ã¾o Ã¾? hous gie shulde, And letith lyghte of Ã¾? lawe and lesse of Ã¾? peple, And herkeneth all to honour and to ese eke, And Ã¾at ich wyght with his witt waite on him euere, To do hem reuerence aright Ã¾ou?

But clerkis kne[w] I non ?ete Ã¾at so couude rede In bokis y-bounde Ã¾ou? ?e brou?te alle Ãat ony wy welldith wonnynge vppon erthe; For in well and in woo Ã¾? werld euere turneth. ?it Ã¾er is kew-kaw Ã¾ou? he come late, A new Ã¾ing Ã¾at noyeth nedy men and oÃ¾er, Whanne realles remeveth and ridith Ã¾oru tounes, And carieth ouere contre Ã¾er comunes dwelleth, To preson Ã¾? pillour?

But ?it Ã¾er is a foule fau?te Ã¾at I fynde ofte: Ãey prien affter presentis or pleyntis ben yclepid, And abateth all Ã¾? billis of Ã¾o Ã¾at nou?th bringith; And ho-so grucche or grone a?eins her grette willes, May lese her lyff lyghtly and no lesse weddis. Thus is Ã¾e lawe louyd Ã¾oru my?hty lordis willys, Ãat meyneteyne myssdoers more Ã¾an oÃ¾er peple. For mayntenance many day well more is Ã¾? reuthe! Hath y-had mo men at mete and at melis Ãan ony cristen kynge Ã¾at ?e knewe euere; For, as reson and rith rehersid to me ones, Tho ben men of Ã¾is molde Ã¾at most harme worchen. For chyders of Chester where chose many daies To ben of conceill for causis Ã¾at in Ã¾? court hangid, And pledid pipoudris alle manere pleyntis. Ãey cared for no coyffes Ã¾at men of court vsyn, But meved many maters Ã¾at man neuer thou?te, And feyned falshed till Ã¾ey a fyne had, And knewe no manere cause as comunes tolde. Ãei had non oÃ¾er signe to schewe Ã¾? lawe But a preuy pallette her pannes to kepe, To hille here lewde heed in stede of an houe. Ãey constrewed quarellis to quenche Ã¾? peple, And pletid with pollaxis and poyntis of swerdis, And at Ã¾e dome-?euynge drowe out Ã¾? bladis, And lente men leuere of her longe battis. Ãey lacked alle vertues Ã¾at a juge shulde haue; For, er a tale were ytolde Ã¾ey wolde trie Ã¾? harmes, Withoute ony answere but ho his lyf hatid. And ho-so pleyned to Ã¾e prince Ã¾at pees shulde kepe, Of Ã¾ese mystirmen medlers of wrongis, He was lygh[t]liche ylau?te and y-luggyd of many, And y-mummyd on Ã¾e mouthe and manaced to Ã¾e deth.

Ãer nas rial of Ã¾? rewme Ã¾at hem durste rebuke, Ne juge ne justice Ã¾at jewis durste hem deme For oute Ã¾at Ã¾ei toke or trespassid to Ã¾? peple.

Passus quartus. For where was euere ony cristen kynge Ã¾at ?e euere knewe, Ãat helde swiche an household be Ã¾? halfdelle As Richard in Ã¾is rewme Ã¾oru myserule of oÃ¾er, Ãat alle his fynys for fau?tis ne his fee-fermes, Ne for-feyturis fele Ã¾at felle in his daies, Ne Ã¾? nownagis Ã¾at newed him euere, As Marche and Moubray and many mo oÃ¾er, Ne alle Ã¾? issues of court Ã¾at to Ã¾e kyng longid, Ne sellynge, Ã¾at sowkid siluer rith faste, Ne alle Ã¾e prophete of Ã¾? lond Ã¾at Ã¾e prince owed, Whane Ã¾e countis were caste with Ã¾? custum of wullus, My?te not areche ne his rent noÃ¾er, To paie Ã¾? pore peple Ã¾at his puruyours toke, Withoute preiere at a parlement a poundage biside, And a fifteneth and a dyme eke, And with all Ã¾? custum of Ã¾? cloÃ¾?

Now ye haue y-herde of Ã¾e haselle names Of officiers withynne and withoute eke, But yit of alle Ã¾e burnes Ã¾e beste is behinde Forto serue a souurayn in somer and in wintre, And most nedeful at eue and at morowe eke, And a profitable page for princes or for ducz Or for any lay lord, lettrid or elles, That litel is y-take fourth or his tale lyeued; And yf ye willeth to wite what Ã¾e wight hatte, Hit is a sothe-sigger Ã¾at seilde is y-seye To be cherisshid of chief in chambre or in halle, But for his rathe reasons is rebukid ofte, And yf he fable to ferre, Ã¾e foote he goeth vndre. [T]here is no clerc with Ã¾e king Ã¾at cloÃ¾id hym ones, [B]ut cloÃ¾id hym at cristmasse and al Ã¾e yere after. [S]aunder Ã¾e seruiselees shuld be his name, [For] he abidith in no houshold half a yere to Ã¾ende [But Ã¾e] lord and Ã¾e lady been loeth of his wordes, And Ã¾e meyny and he mowe not accorde, But al to-teereth his toppe for his trewe tales. He can not speke in termes ne in tyme nother, But bablith fourth bustusely as barn vn-y-lerid; But euer he hitteth on Ã¾e heed of Ã¾e nayle-is ende, That the pure poynt pricketh on Ã¾e sothe Til Ã¾e foule flessh vomy for attre. Thenne is Ã¾is freeke a-frountid for his feithful tale, And y-[fulled] vndre foote while falsenes goeth aboute With cautelle and with coigne forto caste deceiptz Hough trouthe might be trauerssid and tournid of Ã¾e weye. Thenne fareth fals fourth and flatereth atte beste And lightly is y-lyved withoute long tale, And euery gome of hym glad, so glorieusely he loketh Thorough Ã¾e peynt[ur]e of Ã¾e preynte Ã¾at in Ã¾e palme hongeth. Right as Ã¾e cockil cometh fourth ere Ã¾e corne ripe, With a cleer colour, as cristal hit semeth, Among Ã¾e grayne Ã¾at is grene and not ful growe, Right so fareth falsnesse Ã¾at so freysh loketh Thorough Ã¾e colour of Ã¾e crosse Ã¾at many men incumbreth. But whenne trouthe aftre tornement hath tyme forto kerne And to growe fro Ã¾e grovnde anone to Ã¾ende, Thenne fadeth Ã¾e flour of Ã¾e fals cockil. That likne I to lyers, for atte Ã¾e long goyng, Of euery segge-is sawe Ã¾e sothe wol be knowe. Yit is hit not my cunseil to clatre what me knoweth In sclaundre ne scathe ne scorne of Ã¾y brother, For though Ã¾y tale be trewe Ã¾yn tente might be noyous, For whiche Ã¾ou mighte be harmed and haue Ã¾at Ã¾ou serues. For go to Ã¾e gospel Ã¾at grovnd is of lore, And Ã¾ere shal Ã¾ou see Ã¾yself, yf Ã¾ou can rede, Whethir I wisse Ã¾e wel wisely or elles. He seith Ã¾at Ã¾ou shuldes Ã¾e synne of Ã¾y brother Telle hym by tyme and til hymsilf oon, Yn ful wil to amende hym of his mysse-deedes. And yf he chargeth not Ã¾y charite but chideth Ã¾e agaynes, Yit leue hym not so lightly Ã¾ough he lovre oones, But funde hym to freyne efte of Ã¾e newe, And haue wittenes Ã¾e with Ã¾at Ã¾ou wel knowes, And spare not to speke, spede yf Ã¾ou mowe, And he Ã¾at moost is of might Ã¾y mede shal quite For suche [soeth] sawes Ã¾at sounen into good, And of a reasonable man rewarde to haue. For whenne Ã¾y tente and Ã¾y tale been temprid in oone, And menys no malice to man Ã¾at Ã¾ou spekys, But forto mende hym mukely of his misse-deedes, Sory for his synne and his shrewed taicches, And Ã¾e burne be y-blessid and balys cunne eschewe And thrifty and towarde, Ã¾ou shal thanke gete. Were I a lord of a lande Ã¾at lawe aughte gouuerne, Suche a siker seruant shuld haue robes, Though he seide euer sothe and seruyd of noon other. But now wolde I wite of a wise burne, What kynnes creature Ã¾at me couthe telle Where to finde Ã¾is freek, yf Ã¾e king wolde Haue hym in housholde as holsum were. âBy Crist,â cothe a clerc Ã¾at conceipte he had, âThere is no wiseman, I wene, wolde be y-weddid To suche a simple seruice, a-say where Ã¾e liketh, For no maniere [mede] Ã¾at Ã¾ereto belongeth, Ne ferthryng ne frendship while flatryng helpeth. For alle Ã¾e greet clercz Ã¾at with Ã¾e king lendith Knoweth Ã¾is as kindely as clerc doeth his bokes: Hit is no siker seruice but for a somer saison, But yf hit were for a fool Ã¾at wold not be ferthred. He might sey sothe sum while among Ã¾aym And shuld be holde fooly Ã¾ough hit feul after.â But muche now I meruaille, and so mowen other, That oure corouned king is kepte fro Ã¾o ludes, Forto [saye] hym Ã¾e sothe sum while among Hough he shuld grece Ã¾e griefz er Ã¾e woundz gunne festre And so to leede his life in loue of Ã¾e royaulme. For Ã¾e poure peuple hath prece of Ã¾aym many Forto telle Ã¾aym Ã¾aire toyes twyes a woke; And any neighebourgh be nigh on eue or a morowe, Hit wold not long be lefte, my life durste I wedde; And Ã¾at is grace and Ã¾aire good happe to gouuerne Ã¾aym better And in welthe to be ware ere Ã¾at woo falle. But Ã¾e king ne his cunseil cunne not mete with Ã¾aym, But cleerly Ã¾e cause I knowe not for sothe But dreede of Ã¾e deeth dryveth Ã¾aym Ã¾ens, Or elles looste of Ã¾aire likerous life vppon erthe. Thus is Ã¾e court accumbrid and knoweth not Ã¾aire happes Ne God neither goodman ne Ã¾aym-self nothir, Til fortune for foolie falle atte laste, And al Ã¾e world wondre on Ã¾aire wilde deedes. But yf Ã¾e king might knowe Ã¾at Ã¾e comune talketh [H]ough grotz been y-gadrid and no grief amendid [A]nd hough Ã¾e lawe is y-lad whenne poure men pleyne, [I] bilieue loyally oure liege lord wolde [Ha]ue pitie on his peuple for his owen profit [An]d amende Ã¾at were amysse into more ease. [B]ut Ã¾e cause why Ã¾e king knoweth not Ã¾e mischief Is for faute of a fabuler that I bifore tolde of, Forto telle hym Ã¾e texte, and touche not Ã¾e glose, How Ã¾e worde walketh with oon and with other. But whenne oure comely king came furst to londe, Tho was eche burne bolde to bable what hym aylid And to fable ferther of fautz and of wrongz, And romansid of Ã¾e misse-reule Ã¾at in Ã¾e royaulme groved, And were behote high helpe, I herde hit myself Y-cried at Ã¾e crosse, and was Ã¾e king-is wille Of custume of coylaige Ã¾e comunes shuld be easid. But how Ã¾e couenant is y-kepte I can not discryue, For with Ã¾e king-is cunseil I come but silde. But piez with a papegeay parlid of oones, And were y-plumed and y-pullid and put into a caige. Sith Ã¾e briddes were y-bete Ã¾e beke is vndre whinge But yf Ã¾ay parle priuyly to Ã¾aire owen peeris. But Ã¾e king ne his cunseil may hit not knowe What is Ã¾e comune clamour ne Ã¾e crye nother, For Ã¾ere is no man of Ã¾e meeyne, more noÃ¾er lasse, That wol wisse Ã¾aym any worde but yf his witte faille, Ne telle Ã¾aym Ã¾e trouthe ne Ã¾e texte nothir, But shony forto shewe what Ã¾e shire meneth, And beguile Ã¾aym with glose, so me God helpe, And speke of Ã¾aire owen spede and spie no ferther, But euer kepe Ã¾aym cloos for caicching of wordes. And yf a burne bolde hym to bable Ã¾e sothe And [mynne] hym of mischief Ã¾at misse-reule asketh, He may lose his life and laugh here no more, Or y-putte into prisone or y-pyned to deeth Or y-[brent] or y-shent or sum sorowe haue, That fro scorne oÃ¾er scathe scape shal he neure. Thus is trouthe doune y-troode and tenyd ful ofte, Y-bete and y-bounde in bourghes and in shires, And principaly of princes y-pyned Ã¾enne of other, Y-[halowid] and y-huntid and y-hoote trusse, That he shoneth to be seye forto shewe his harmes, But euer hideth his heede fro Ã¾e hayl-stones, And is ouer-woxe with wrong and wickid wedes, And tenyd with tares and al amisse temprid. Yit wol he growe fro [greue] and his grayne bere, And after sowe his seede whenne he seeth tyme. For alle Ã¾e gomes vndre God goyng vppon erthe Were neuer so slygh yit forto sle trouthe; Though Ã¾ay batre hym with battz and bete on hym euer, Trouthe is so tough and loeth forto teere And so pryuy with Ã¾e prince Ã¾at paradis made That he hath graunt of his lyfe while God is in heuene For Ã¾ough men brenne the borough Ã¾ere Ã¾e burne loiggeth, Or elles hewe of Ã¾e heede Ã¾ere he a hows had, Or do hym al Ã¾e disease Ã¾at men deuise cunne, Yit wol he quyke agayne and quite alle his foes And treede ouer Ã¾e tares Ã¾at ouer his toppe groued, And al wickid wede into waste tourne. And Ã¾erefore my cunseil (Ã¾ough Ã¾e king knowe hit And alle Ã¾e lordz of Ã¾is londe, right lite is my charge) Ys to be at oone with trouthe and tarre hym nomore, Leste he tucke at your tabart ere two yere been endid, But ye suffre his seruant to be seye oones Among you in Ã¾e moneth (but yf ye more wil) Forto saye you Ã¾e sothe, Ã¾ough ye shame thenke. For hit wol sauere your mouthe swetely with-ynne short after Whenne fortune you fleeth and falleth elles-where; And yf ye sauere on his sawe and serue Ã¾ereafter And eke wirche by his worde, Ã¾e whele wol tourne And eke chaunge his cours of care and of sorowe, And tourne into tidewel, terme of your lifes. Now is Henry-is hovs holsumly y-made And a meritable meyny of Ã¾e moste greet, And next I haue y-named as nygh as I couthe, And Ã¾e condicions declarid of alle, Rehershing no rascaille ne riders aboute. But he hymsilf is souurayn, and so mote he longe, And Ã¾e graciousist guyer goyng vppon erthe, Witti and wise, worthy of deedes, Y-kidde and y-knowe and cunnyng of werre, Feers forto fighte, Ã¾e felde euer kepith, And trusteth on Ã¾e Trinite Ã¾at trouthe shal hym helpe; A doughtful doer in deedes of armes And a comely knight y-come of Ã¾e grettist, Ful of al vertue Ã¾at to a king longeth, Of age and of al Ã¾ing as hym best semeth. But hit be wel in his dayes we mowe dreede aftre Lest feerelees falle withynne fewe yeres. But God of his goodnes Ã¾at gouuernith alle Ã¾ingz Hym graunte of his grace to guye wel Ã¾e peuple And to reule Ã¾is royaume in pees and in reste, And stable hit to stonde stille for oure dayes. But I dreed me sore, so me God helpe, [L]este couetise of cunseil Ã¾at knoweth not hymself ([O]f sum and of certayn, I seye not of alle) [Th]at of profitable pourpos putteth Ã¾e king ofte, [Th]ere his witte and his wil wolde wirche to Ã¾e besteâ âNomore of Ã¾is matiere,â cothe Mum Ã¾enne, âFor I meruaille of Ã¾y momeling more Ã¾enne Ã¾ou wenys. Saides [not] Ã¾ou Ã¾yself, and sothe as me Ã¾oughte, That Ã¾ees sothe-siggers seruen noon Ã¾ankes? And Ã¾ou knowes Ã¾is by clergie, how cans Ã¾ou Ã¾e excuse That Ã¾ou ne art nycier Ã¾an a nunne nyne-folde tyme, Forto wite Ã¾at Ã¾y wil Ã¾y witte shal passe?â I blussid for his bablyng and a-bode stille And knytte Ã¾ere a knotte and construed no ferther; But yit I thoughte ere he wente, and he wold abide, To haue a disputeson with hym and spie what he hatte. âI am Mum Ã¾y maisterâ cothe he âin alle maniere places, That [sittith] with souuerayns and seruyd with greete. Thaire wille ne Ã¾aire wordes I withseye neuer, But folowe thaym in thaire folie and fare muche Ã¾e bettre, Easily for oyle, sire, and elles were I nyce. Thus leede I my life in luste of my herte, And for my wisedame and witte wone I with Ã¾e beste; While sergeantz Ã¾e sechith to saise by Ã¾e lappe For Ã¾y wilde wordes Ã¾at maken wretthe ofte. Thow were better folowe me foure score wynter Thenne be a soeth-sigger, so me God helpe, Oon myle and nomore waye, I Mvm wol avowe. And Ã¾erefore I rede, yf Ã¾ou reste wilnest, Cumpaignye with no contra yn no kynnes wise, But parle for Ã¾y profit and plaise more here-aftre. For Ã¾ere nys lord of Ã¾is londe ne lady, I wene, Prince nether prelat ne peer of Ã¾e royaulme, Bachillier ne bourgoys ne no barne elles That yf Ã¾ay wite what Ã¾ou arte, Ã¾at wil Ã¾e desire Or coueite to his cumpaignie while contra Ã¾e folowethâ. âNow to Ã¾is altercacionâ, cothe I, âan answere behoueth; For I fele by Ã¾y fabelyng Ã¾ou art felle of werkes And right worldly wise of wordes and deedes, And euer kepis Ã¾e cloos for [casting] bihinde. Thou wol not putte Ã¾e in prees but profit be Ã¾e more To Ã¾y propre persone Ã¾ou passes not Ã¾e bondes Forto gete any grucche for glaunsyng of boltes. Thus me semeth Ã¾at Ã¾ou serues Ã¾y-self and no man elles, And has housholde and hire to holde vp Ã¾y oyles, And eke bouche of court for colte and for [cnaue]; And [yit] Ã¾ou suffris Ã¾y souurayn to shame hym-self There Ã¾ou mightes amende hym many tyme and ofte. Now suche a-nothir seruant, Ã¾e same and noon oÃ¾er, Mote dwelle with Ã¾e deueil til Do Bette hym helpe.â Thus after talkyng we twynned a-sundre, Bothe Mvm and I, and oure mote endid; But muche mervailled I, whenne Mvm was passid, Of his opinion Ã¾at he heulde euer, And prouyd hit by profitable poyntz [and fele] That better was a burne to abide stille Thanne Ã¾e soeth to seye Ã¾at sitteth in his herte, Forto warne Ã¾e wy Ã¾at he with dwellith, Or mynne hym of mischief Ã¾at misse-rewle askith. And euer he concludid with colorable wordes That who-so mellid muche more Ã¾an hit nedeth Shuld rather wynne weping watre Ã¾enne robes. And cleerly Caton construeth Ã¾e same, And seyth soethly, I saw hit in youthe, That of âbableâ cometh blame and of âbe stilleâ neuer, And a wise worldly worde, as me Ã¾enketh, Of Ã¾e whiche I was hevy and highly abawyd, And for Ã¾e double doute as dul as an asse, And troublid for Ã¾e travers, and amisse temprid, That I wente in a wyre a grete while after For woo I ne wiste who had Ã¾e better Of Mvm and of me, and musid faste, Rehershyng Ã¾e reasons of bothe two sides, The pro and Ã¾e contra as clergie askith. But for witte Ã¾at I wanne I wolde Ã¾at he knewe I was neuer Ã¾e nyre, but as newe to begynne As clerc is to construe Ã¾at can not reede. Thenne Ã¾oughte I on Sidrac and Salomon-is termes, And Seneca Ã¾e sage I soughte for Ã¾e nones, That whilom were Ã¾e wisest wies vppon erthe Forto wise any wighte, what-so hym grieued. I bablid on Ã¾oo bokes Ã¾at Ã¾oo barnes made, And waitid on Ã¾aire wordes aswel as I couthe, But of Ã¾e matiere of Mvm might I nought finde, Ne no maniere nycete of Ã¾e newe [iette], But al homely vsage of Ã¾e olde date, How Ã¾at [good] gouuernance gracieusely endith. But glymsyng on Ã¾e glose, a general revle Of al maniere mischief I merkid and radde: That who-so were in wire and wold be y-easid Moste shewe Ã¾e sore Ã¾ere Ã¾e salue were. Thenne was I wel ware what he wolde mene, That I shulde cunne of clergie to knowe Ã¾e sothe, Forto deme Ã¾e doute Ã¾at me so dul made. I was wilful of wil and wandrid aboute, Til I came to Cambrigge couthe I not stynte, To Oxenford and Orleance and many oÃ¾er places There Ã¾e congregacion of clercz in scole Were stablid to stonde in strengthe of bilieue. I moeued my matiere of Mvm, as ye knowe, And of Ã¾e soeth-sigger in fewe shorte wordes; To alle Ã¾e vij sciences I shewed as I couthe, And how we dwellid in [dwere] and doute of Ã¾e better. Sire Grumbald Ã¾e grammier Ã¾o glowed for anger That he couthe not congruly knytte Ã¾aym to-gedre. Music and Mvm mighte not accorde, For Ã¾ay been contrary of kynde, who-so canne spie. Phisic diffied al [Ã¾e] bothe sides, Bothe Mvm and me and Ã¾e soeth-siggre; He was accumbrid of oure cumpaignye, by Crist Ã¾at me bought, And as fayn of oure voiding as foul [of his make]. Astronomy-ys argumentz were alle of Ã¾e skyes, He-is touche no twynte of terrene Ã¾inges. Rethoric-is reasons me luste not reherce, For he conceyued not Ã¾e caas, I knewe by his wordes; But a subtile shophister with many sharpe wordes Sette [Ã¾e] soeth-sigger as shorte as he couthe. But he wolde melle with Mvm ner more ner lasse, So chiding and chatering [as choghe] was he euer. Ieometrie Ã¾e ioynour iablid faste, And caste many cumpas, as Ã¾e crafte askith, And laide leuel and lyne a-long by Ã¾e squyre. But I was not Ã¾e wiser by a Walsh note Of Ã¾e matiere of Mvm Ã¾at marrid me ofte, And stoode al a-stonyed and starid for angre That clergie couthe not my cares amende, And was in pourpoos to passe fourth right in pure wreth. But a semely sage Ã¾at satte al a-bouue, Y-chose to Ã¾e chaire forto chaste fooles, Whom alle Ã¾e vij. sciences seruyd at wille, Bothe in werke and in worde weren at his heste, And more bunne at his bede Ã¾an boy til his maister, He satte as a souurayn on a high siege. A doctour of doutz by dere God he semyd, For he had loked al Ã¾at lay to Ã¾e .vij. artz; He was as ful of philosophie and vertues bothe As man vppon molde mighte perceyue. This comely clerc me called agaynes, And cunseillid me so cleerly Ã¾at I caughte ease, And seide, âsoon, seest Ã¾ou Ã¾is semble of clercz, How Ã¾ay bisien Ã¾aym on Ã¾aire bokes and beten Ã¾aire wittz, And how Ã¾ay loken on Ã¾e levis Ã¾e [letter] to knowe? For whenne Ã¾ay knowen Ã¾e scripture Ã¾ay construen no ferther Forto soutille ne to siche no side-wayes. But as long as I haue lerned and lokid in bokes, And alle Ã¾e vij. sciences y-soughte to Ã¾ende, Yit knewe I neuer suche a caas, ne no clerc here, As Ã¾ou has y-moeued among vs alle. Hit is sum noyous nycete of Ã¾e newe iette, For Ã¾e texte truly telleth vs nomore But how Ã¾at goode gouuernance graciousely endith. But and Ã¾ou woldes be wise and wirche as I telle, I wolde wisse Ã¾e to wite where Ã¾at Ã¾ou shuldest Haue knowlaiche of Ã¾y caas cleere to Ã¾yn intent, And Ã¾y cumberouse question quycly be assoilled. Now harke and holde and hye to Ã¾ende. Sum of Ã¾is semble Ã¾at Ã¾ou sees here, Whenne Ã¾ay haue loked Ã¾e lettre and Ã¾e lyfe[z] ouer Of alle Ã¾e .vij. sciences or sum as Ã¾aym liketh, Thay walken fourth in Ã¾e worlde and wonen with lordes, And with a couetous croke Saynt Nicholas Ã¾ay throwen, And trauaillen nomore on Ã¾e texte, but tournen to Ã¾e glose, And putten Ã¾aym to practike and plaisance of wordes. But Ã¾ay cunne deme Ã¾y doute, by dere God in heuene, I can not knowe of Ã¾y caas who couthe elles.â Thenne ferkid I to freres, alle Ã¾e foure ordres, There Ã¾e fundament of feith and felnesse of workes Hath y-dwellid many day, no doute, as Ã¾ay telle. I frayned Ã¾aym faire to fele of Ã¾aire wittes, And moeuyd my matiere of Mvm, as ye knowe, And of Ã¾e soeth-sigger in fewe sho[r]te wordes. To euery couple I construed my caas for Ã¾e nones, Til the cloistre and Ã¾e quyre were so accorded To yeue Mvm Ã¾e maistrie withoute mo wordes, And shewid me exemples, Ã¾e sothest vppon erthe, Nad Mvm be a more frende to making of Ã¾aire houses Thenne Ã¾e sothe-sigger, so God shuld Ã¾aym helpe, Hit had be vnhelid half a yere after. Now ne were thre skiles and scantly Ã¾e ferthe, I wolde loue as litel Ã¾aire life and Ã¾aire deedes As man vppon molde, til Amendes me prayed. The furst is a faire poynt forto wynne heuene, Whenne Ã¾ay stirid a statute in strengthe of bilieue That no preste shuld preche saue seely poure freres. But Ã¾is [deede] dide Ã¾ay not, I do you to wite, For no maniere mede Ã¾at mighte Ã¾aym befalle, Ne forto gete Ã¾e more good God wote Ã¾e sothe, But for good herte Ã¾at Ã¾ay haue to hele [men-is] soules. The secund is a pryvy poynt I pray hit be helid: Thay cunne not reede redelles a-right, as me Ã¾enketh; For furst folowid freres Lollardz [names], And sith hath be shewed Ã¾e same on Ã¾aym-self, That Ã¾aire lesingz haue lad Ã¾aym to lolle by Ã¾e necke; At Tibourne for traison y-twyght vp Ã¾ay were. For as hit is y-seide by eldryn dawes, âÃe churle yafe a dome whiche came by hym aftreâ. The thrid is no lesing ne no long tale: Thees good grey freres Ã¾at mouche loue geten For keping of Ã¾aire conscience clenner Ã¾an other, Thay goon al bare abouue Ã¾e foote and by-nethe double With smale semyd sockes and of softe wolle, For Ã¾e loue of oure lord harde life induren; Thay mellen with no monaye more noÃ¾er lasse, But stiren hit with a sticke and staren on hit ofte And doon Ã¾aire bisynes Ã¾ere-with by obedience of Ã¾ordre; But in Ã¾e herte ne in Ã¾e hande ne may hit not come, For Ã¾enne Ã¾ay shuld bee shent of Ã¾e subpriour. The fourthe poynt is fructuous and fundid al in loue: Whenne freres goon to chapitre for charite-is sake, Thay casten Ã¾ere Ã¾e cuntrey and coostz aboute, And parten Ã¾e prouynce in parcelle-mele, And maken limitacions in lengthe and in breede, Til eche hovs haue his owen as hym aughte. Thenne hath Ã¾e limitour leue to lerne where he cometh To lye and to licke or elles lose his office; But sum been so courtoys and kinde of Ã¾aire deedes That with Ã¾aire charite Ã¾ay chaungen a knyfe for a peyre, But he wol pille ere he passe a parcelle of whete And choise of Ã¾e chese Ã¾e chief and Ã¾e beste. He is so cunnyng in Ã¾e crafte Ã¾at where-so he cometh He leueth Ã¾e lasse for Ã¾e more deele. Thus with Ã¾aire charite and with Ã¾aire fayre chere Thees good God-is men gadren al to Ã¾aym And kepen hit to Ã¾aire owen croppe clene fro other. For Ã¾ough a frere be fatt and haue a ful coffre Of gold and of good, Ã¾ou getys but a lite Forto bete Ã¾y bale, Ã¾ough Ã¾ou begge euer. But Ã¾at is no meruail, by Marie of heuene, For to begge of a begger what bote is hit But who wolde balle [with] his [browe] to breke harde stones? Thus Ã¾aire conscience is y-knowe and Ã¾aire crafte eeke, That hath be kepte cunseil and cloos many dayes, Til al Ã¾e world wote what Ã¾ay wolde meene; And Ã¾at is Ã¾is trevly, tende who-so wil, Thorough crafte of confession to knowe men intentz,â Of lordz and ladies that lustes desiren, And with Ã¾aire wyly wittz wirchen on euer And mulden vp Ã¾e matiere to make Ã¾aym fatte, And gouuernen Ã¾e grete and guilen Ã¾e poure. Now take my tale as my intent demeth, And ye shal wel wite I wil Ã¾aym no mischief By my worde ne by my wille as wissely [for] sothe As God Ã¾at is oure gouuernour me gye at my nede. For whenne Ã¾ay come to your cote to craue Ã¾at Ã¾aym nedeth, Gyfe Ã¾aym for God-is sake and with a good wille Mete or monaye as ye mowe indure, And yefe Ã¾aym sauce Ã¾ere-with of Ã¾e sothe-sigger Forto preche Ã¾e peuple Ã¾e peril of synne, How symonie shendith al hooly churche, And not forbere bisshop ne baron Ã¾at lyveth That Ã¾ay teche treuly Ã¾e texte as hit standeth, And abide Ã¾ereby with a bolde herte, And spare for no spicerie ne no speche elles, But telle oute Ã¾e trouthe and tourne not a-side How Couetise hath caste Ã¾e knyght on Ã¾e grene, And woneth at Westmynstre to wynne newe spores, And can not crepe Ã¾ens while Ã¾e crosse walketh. He multiplieth monaye in Ã¾e mote-halle More for his mayntenance and manasshing of wordes Thenne with draughte of his swerde or deedes of armes. And telle Ã¾e frere a toquen, Ã¾at trouthe wote Ã¾e sothe Why men meruaillen more on Ã¾aym Ã¾anne on othir,â That suche a cumpaignye of confessours cunne not yelde Oon martir among Ã¾aym in .vij. score wynter. Thay prechen alle of penanche as Ã¾ough [Ã¾ay] parfite were, But Ã¾ay proue hit [in no] poynt Ã¾ere Ã¾aire peril shuld arise. Thaire cloÃ¾ing is of conscience and of Caym Ã¾aire werkes, That fadre was and fundre of alle Ã¾e foure ordres, Of deedes Ã¾ay doon deceipuyng Ã¾e peuple, As Armacanes argumentz, Ã¾at Ã¾aire actes knewe, Provyn hit apertly in a poysie-wise; For of Caym alle came, as Ã¾is clerc tolde. For who writeth wel Ã¾is worde and withoute titil, Shal finde of Ã¾e figures but euene foure lettres: C. for hit is crokid [for] Ã¾ees Carmes Ã¾ou mos take, A. for Ã¾ees Augustines Ã¾at amoreux been euer, I. for Ã¾ees Iacobynes Ã¾at been of Iudas kynne, M. for Ã¾ees Menours Ã¾at monsyd been Ã¾aire werkes. I seye of Ã¾aym Ã¾at suche been and cesse agaynes oÃ¾er, But wel I wote Ã¾at wilful and worldly Ã¾ay been sum, And eeke spracke and spitous, and spices wel Ã¾ay louen, For Symon-is sermons Ã¾ay setten al to taske, And feele oÃ¾er fautz fourtene hunthrid Thay lepen ouer lightly, and lyen woundre Ã¾icke. I can not deme deuely of what degre Ã¾ay bee; Thay been not weddid, wel I wote, Ã¾ough Ã¾ay wifes haue; But knightz yit of conscience I couthe of Ã¾aym make, For Ã¾ay haue ioygned [in iustes] agayns Ihesus werkes; And forto proue Ã¾aym prestes Ã¾ees poyntz been agayne Ã¾aym. I can not reede redily of what revle Ã¾ay been, For hooly churche ne heuene hath not Ã¾aym in mynde, Saue in oon place Ã¾aire office and ordre is declarid, I sawe hit in a ympne and is a sentence trewe, And elles-where in hooly writte I herde Ã¾aym y-nempnyd. But of Ã¾e matiere of Mvm ne of Ã¾e sothe-sigger This is not to pourpoos Ã¾e pare of oon pere, And Ã¾erfore my wil is to walke more at large Forto fynde sum freeke Ã¾at of feith were Not double, but indifferent to deme Ã¾e sothe, WheÃ¾er Mvm is more better or Melle-sum-tyme Forto amende Ã¾at were amysse into more ease. And for Ã¾e fikelle freres were fully witholde And alied to Mvm in many maniere wises, And eeke ful partie, as prouyd by Ã¾aire wordes, I lyeued wel Ã¾e lasse Ã¾aire lore and Ã¾aire deedes, And forto eschewe chiding I chalanged Ã¾aym alle, And lepte lightly fro Ã¾aym, leste I laught were; For Ã¾aire curtesie is crokid Ã¾ere Ã¾ay caste ille, And Ã¾at witen Ã¾ay wel Ã¾at han wrastlid with Ã¾aym. Thenne passid I to priories and personages many, To abbeys of Augustyn and many hooly places, There prestz and prelatz were parfitely y-closid To singe and to reede for alle cristen soules. But for I was a meen man I might not entre; For Ã¾ough Ã¾e place were y-pighte for poure men sake And eeke funded Ã¾ere-fore yit faillen Ã¾ay ofte That Ã¾ay doon not eche day do beste of alle. For Ã¾e fundacion of Ã¾e fundours ment Was groundid for God-is men, Ã¾ough hit grete serue. Thay koueiten no comers but yf Ã¾ay cunne helpe Forto amende Ã¾aire mynstre and to maynteyne Ã¾aire rente, Or in worke or in worde waite Ã¾aire profit, Or elles entreth he not til Ã¾ay haue y-[sopid]. Thus thaire portier for my pourete putt me Ã¾ens, And grauntid me of his goodnesse to go where me luste And to wandry where I wolde withoute Ã¾e gates. Thenne raughte I fro religion, redelees of wittes, And caried to closes and cathedralle churches There Ã¾at pluralite was prisely y-stablid. I queyntid me with Ã¾e quyre for my questions sake, And moevid of Mvm more Ã¾enne Ã¾aym liked. I was as wise whenne I wente as whenne I came to Ã¾aym, Thay wolde not intremitte of ner noÃ¾er side, But euer kepte Ã¾aym cloos to [cracche] and to mangier, And fedde so Ã¾e foule flesh Ã¾at Ã¾e velle ne might Vnethe kepe Ã¾e caroigne but yf hit cleue shuld; And nad Ã¾e gutte groned Ã¾ere Ã¾ay gurde were, Thay had bee sike of swete mete, so me God helpe, For piking of prouendre passing Ã¾assise; And nadde Ã¾ay partid with Ã¾e poure as prestz doon Ã¾aire offryng, That putten alle Ã¾aire masse penyes in Ã¾aire purses [bottume], Thay had be blamyd of Belial for Ã¾aire bolde riding Yn gurdellz of good gold or gilte atte leste. Thenne woxe I wondre wery of wandring aboute Thorough Ã¾e wilde weyes Ã¾at I wente had, Ful woo for I ne wiste what was my beste Reedâforto reste or rome more at large Til I wiste wittrely who shulde haue The maistrie, Mvm or Ã¾e sothe-sigger. And euery man Ã¾at I mette mad for my wordes Wende Ã¾at I were wisten Ã¾ay non other. And as I stoode staring, stonyd of Ã¾is matiere, Mvm with his myter manachid me euer And cunseilled me to cusky and care for myself, And leste I soughte sorowe, cesse by tyme. I doutid of his deedes, for his delectacion Was more in his mynde Ã¾enne Ã¾e masse-bokes, And boode til a baron, blessid be he euer, (His name is y-nempnyd among Ã¾e .ix. ordres) Sent a saufconduyt so Ã¾at I wolde Maynteyne no matiere to amende myself, Ne caicche no colour hit came of my wittes, But [sende fro] a souurayn to shewe hit forth after. This boldid me to bisynes to bringe hit to ende Thorough grace of Ã¾is good lord Ã¾at gouuerneth al Ã¾ing. Thenne sought I forth seuenyght and slepte ful silde And cessid on a Saterday til sunne roose a-morowe And burnys and belles [bablid] to-gedre, Momeling on Ã¾aire matyns and to Ã¾e masse after. I satte in a siege my seruice to hire Til Ã¾e prest in a pulpite began forto preche The peuple to pees and Ã¾e peril of synne And also toffre as ofte as Ã¾aym likid. He taughte Ã¾aym by tyme Ã¾aire tithing to bringe Of al manier grene Ã¾at groweth vppon erthe, Of fructe and of floxe in felde and in homes, Of polaille and of peris, of apples and of [plummes], Of grapes and of garlik, of gees and of pigges, Of chibollz and of chiries and of Ã¾aire chese eeke, Herbaige and oygnons and alle suche Ã¾inges That growen in Ã¾aire gardynes, lete God his parte haue, Of hony in your hyves and of your hony-combes, Of malte and of monaye and of all Ã¾at multiplieth, Of wolle and of wexe and [what-]so yow increceth Or newith yow, Ã¾e ix partie nymeth to your self, And trewly Ã¾e tithing taketh hooly churche. And euer I waitid whenne he wolde sum worde moeve How hooly churche goodes shuld be y-spendid, And declare Ã¾e deedes what Ã¾ay do shulde To haue suche a harueste and helpe not to erie. But sorowe on Ã¾e sillable he shewed of Ã¾at matiere, For Mvm was a meen and made hym to leue; And as wery as I was yit was I wrothe eeke With Mvm, for he made Ã¾e moppe so lewed To leue men to lerne Ã¾e lawe sith he knewe hit. Thenne ferkid I forth as faste as I mighte Seuene yere sunnedayes and solempne festes, Yf prest or prelat or prechour wolde Sey sothe of hymself and serue Ã¾ere-after And teche how Ã¾e tithinge shuld trewly be departid. But as wide as I wente was noon of Ã¾aym alle Wolde moeve of Ã¾at matiere more noÃ¾er lasse. And why Ã¾at Ã¾ay wolde not wol ye gladly wite, Thay haue a memoire of Mvm among alle other Ys more in Ã¾aire mynde Ã¾enne martires of heuene That token Ã¾e deeth for trouthe of tirantz handes. But here a querele or a question quyk mighte Ã¾ou make: Martires had more might and more mynde eeke, And couthe more on clergie Ã¾enne cunne now a thousand. But Ã¾ereto I answere as I am lerid: Thou, lewed laudate, litel witte has. Hit was for no cunnyng ne clergie noÃ¾er That Ã¾ay chosid Ã¾e deeth, but for derue loue And kindenes to oure creatour Ã¾at creed vs alle, And for pure trouthe Ã¾at Ã¾ay taught [euer]. This made Ã¾aym martires more Ã¾anne ought elles, For clercz were not knowe by Ã¾aire cloÃ¾ing Ã¾at tyme, Ne by royal raye ne riding aboute, Ne by seruice of souuerayns, so me God helpe, Ne by revel ne riot ne by rente nothir, Ne by Ã¾aire double dees ne Ã¾aire deupe hoodes, Ne by drynkyng of dollid wyne ne by datz at eue, Ne by worldly workes of writtes ne seelyng, Ne by no maniere nicete Ã¾at Ã¾ay now vsen, But by Ã¾e deedes Ã¾at Ã¾ay dide, I do you to wite. For I am but lewed and lettrid ful lite, And yit me semeth Ã¾e sentence Ã¾at I shewe couthe And teche how Ã¾e tithing shuld trewly be departid, For in thre lynes hit [lith] and not oon lettre more. Now hendely hireth how I begynne: That ye clepe God-is parte lete God-is men haue hit, Reseruyng for yourself sustenance for your foode, And Ã¾e ouerplus ouer Ã¾at for ornementz of Ã¾e churche. Though Ã¾is be shortly y-seide, yit so me God helpe, Who-so had cunnyng and a clerc were, Might make a long sermon of Ã¾ees [lite] wordes; And Ã¾ough he toke to his theme âÃ¾e tresour is among Ã¾aym And Ã¾e reuylle of Ã¾e royaulme and Ã¾e richesse bothe,â He shuld not wende of Ã¾e waye two whete cornes. For Ã¾ay haue tollid so Ã¾e tithing Ã¾ay han Ã¾e two dooles, And been so vsid to ease erly and late That Ã¾ay cunne no crafte saue kepe Ã¾aym warme. Thay bisien more for benefices Ã¾enne bibles to reede, And been as worldly wise and wynners eeke As man vppon molde, and asmuche louen Mvm and Ã¾e monaye, by Marie of heuene, For mayntenance and mede been Ã¾aire two mates. âYit wil Ã¾ou melle moreâ, cothe Mvm, âÃ¾enne hit nedeth. Be stille lest Ã¾ou stumble, for Ã¾ou stondes ful slidre, And Ã¾ou moeue any more suche maniere wordes. Thay been not holsum for Ã¾y heed ne for Ã¾y herte noÃ¾er, For Ã¾ou mos holde with Ã¾e mo yf Ã¾ou Ã¾y helthe willes; And so I haue y-tolde Ã¾e twyes and oones. Thou art mad of Ã¾y mynde, and amysse levis That Mvm hath a maister Ã¾ere men been of goode; For Mvm maketh mo men at a moneth-ende Thanne Ã¾e sothe-sigger in seuene score winter; For he is priuy with Ã¾e pruttist and Ã¾ere Ã¾e price caicchet, [And] is y-drawe to Ã¾e deys with deyntees y-seruyd Whenne Ã¾e sothe-sigger dar not be seye. For and a matier be moeued at mete or at eue Or in pryuy places Ã¾ere peeris assemblen, Mvm musith Ã¾ere-on and maketh many cautelles With a locke on his lippe and loketh aboute. He spendith no speche but spices hit make, Til he wite whitherward Ã¾at wil doo drawe. But Ã¾enne he knittith a knotte and cometh al at ones And getith hym a greet Ã¾anke to go among Ã¾e beste. Fle fooly Ã¾erefore, and frendes Ã¾e make, And a-rete, I Ã¾e rede, and rome no ferther, For Ã¾ou walkis of Ã¾e weye forto wynne siluer. And carpe no more of clergie but yf Ã¾ou cunne leepe, For and Ã¾ou come on Ã¾aire clouche, Ã¾ou crepis not Ã¾ens Til Ã¾ou wite right wel with whom Ã¾at Ã¾ou mellys.â âI-wis I wil not,â cothe I, âtil I wite more; For prestz been not perillous but pacient of Ã¾aire werkes, And eeke Ã¾e plantz of pees and ful of pitie euer, And chief of al charite y-chose a-fore other; Forto fighte ne to flite hit falleth not to Ã¾aire ordre, Ne to prece to no place Ã¾ere peril shuld be ynne. That proueth wel by parlement, for prelatz shuld be voidid Whenne any dome of deeth shal be do Ã¾ere, Al for cause Ã¾aire conscience to kepe vn-y-wemmyd. A man may saye Ã¾aym Ã¾e sothe sonest of alle, Withoute grucche oÃ¾er groyn, but gete many Ã¾ankes.

And Ã¾at I pryved by a poynt Ã¾ou perceipues neuer, Al a-tw[art] Ã¾y intent and Ã¾y tale eeke, For Pilat in Ã¾e Passion among al Ã¾e peuple Wilned aftre watre to waisshe with his handes, To shewe hym by Ã¾at signe, of Ã¾e bloode-sheding Of Crist Ã¾at vs creed and on Ã¾e crosse deyed, His conscience was clensid as clene as his handes. Yit was he ground of Ã¾e grame and moste guilty eeke, For euery man Ã¾at mynde hath may wel wite That prelatz aughten haue pite when princz bee moeued, And reede Ã¾aym so Ã¾at rancune roote not in hert, And ere Ã¾e grame growe ferre Ã¾e ground so to wede And amende Ã¾at were mysse ere any moore caicche Of man-slaughter or mourdre, as hath many dayes. For who hath knowlache of a cloude by cours of a-bouue, And wil stande stille til Ã¾e storme falle, And wende not of Ã¾e waye, Ã¾e wite is his owen. Though hit heelde on his heede, who is to blame? For who hath sight of a showre Ã¾at sharpely a-riseth, And wil not caste hym to kepe with couryng abouue Til hit droppe al a-dovne and dung-wete hym make, And eeke falle on his frende, in feith as me Ã¾enketh, He is auctor of al Ã¾e harme and Ã¾ache And so pryuy to Ã¾e peynes Ã¾at [his] peeres induren. And also in cuntrey hit is a comune speche And is y-write in Latyne, lerne hit who-so wil: The reason is âqui tacet consentire videturâ. And who-so hath in-sight of silde-couthe thingz, Of synne or of shame or of shonde outher, And luste not to lette hit, but leteth hit forth passe As clercz doon construe Ã¾at knowen alle bokes, He shal be demyd doer of Ã¾e same deede. And eeke in lond-is lawe I lernyd by anothir: Yf a freeke for felonye is frayned atte barre For traison or for trespas and he a tunge haue And wil not answere to Ã¾e deede he is of indited, But stont stille as a stoone and no worde stire, But he be deef or dum to deeth shal he wende, As atteynt for Ã¾e trespas, and is a trewe lawe.

There shuldrid sergeant[z] to serue atte mete For a male ful of misse-deedz Ã¾at Mvm had in keping. I stoode stille as a stoone and starid aboute And lokid lightly a-long by Ã¾e bordes, Yf any sothe-sigger were sette in Ã¾e halle. But sorowe on Ã¾e shyne I sawe of hym Ã¾ere, But yf he were a soleyn and seruyd al oon, For alle was huyst in Ã¾e halle sauf âholde vp Ã¾e oylesâ. And forto saye sothe and shone long tale, The sunne and Ã¾e sergeant[z] my sight so dasid That I might not eche messe merke as me luste. I askid of a eldryn man as I beste couthe Yf any sothe-sigger sate in Ã¾e halle, And he answerid sharply Ã¾at âÃ¾e sothe-sigger Dyneth Ã¾is day with Dreede in a chambre, And hath y-drunke dum-seede, and dar not be seye Sith Mvm and Ã¾e mayer were made suche frendesâ. Thenne waxe I woundre wrothe, as I wel might, And drowe me to Ã¾e doreward and dwelled no lenger, But romed forth reedelees, remembring ofte That Mvm was suche a maister among men of good. And as I lokid Ã¾e loigges along by Ã¾e streetz, I sawe a sothe-sigger, in sothe as me Ã¾ought, Sitte in a shoppe and salwyn his woundes. Thenne was I ful-come and knewe wel Ã¾e sothe That Mvm vppon molde myrier life had Thenne Ã¾e sothe-sigger, asay who-so wol; But Ã¾e better barne to abide stille And to lyve with a lord to his life-is ende Ys Ã¾e sothe-sigger, a-say who-so wol. Yit was I not Ã¾e wiser for waye Ã¾at I wente; This made me al madde as I most nede, And wel fleuble and faynt, and feulle to Ã¾e grounde, And lay dovne on a lynche to lithe my boones, Rolling in remembrance my rennyng aboute And alle Ã¾e perillous patthes Ã¾at I passid had, As priories and personagz and pluralites, Abbayes of Augustyn and oÃ¾er hooly places, To knightes courtz and crafty men many, To mayers and maisters, men of high wittes, And to Ã¾e felle freris, alle Ã¾e foure ordres, And oÃ¾er hobbes a-heepe, as ye herde haueâ And nought Ã¾e neer by a note Ã¾is noyed me ofte That Ã¾orough construyng of clercz Ã¾at knewe alle bokes That Mvm shuld be maister moste vppon erthe. And ere I were ware, a wynke me assailled, That I slepte sadly seuene houres large. Thenne mette I of mervailles mo Ã¾anne me luste To telle or to talke of, til I se tyme; But sum of Ã¾e silde-couthes I wol shewe here-after, For dreme is no dwele by Danyel-is wordes, Though Caton of Ã¾e contrarye carpe in his bokes. Me Ã¾ought I was in wildernesse walking al oon, There bestes were and briddes and no barne elles, Yn a cumbe cressing on a creste wise, Al gras grene Ã¾at gladid my herte, By a cliffe vn-y-knowe of Crist-is owen makyng. I lepte forth lightly a-long by Ã¾e heigges And movid forth myrily to maistrie Ã¾e hilles, For til I came to Ã¾e coppe couthe I not stynte Of Ã¾e highest hille by halfe [of] alle other. I tournyd me twyes and totid aboute, Beholding heigges and holtz so grene, The mansions and medues mowen al newe, For suche was Ã¾e saison of Ã¾e same yere. I lifte vp my eye-ledes and lokid ferther And sawe many swete sightz, so me God helpe, The wodes and Ã¾e waters and Ã¾e welle-springes And trees y-traylid fro toppe to Ã¾erthe, Coriously y-courid with curtelle of grene, The flours on feeldes flavryng swete, The corne on Ã¾e croftes y-croppid ful faire, The rennyng riuyere russhing faste, Ful of fyssh and of frie of felefold kinde, The breris with Ã¾aire beries bent ouer Ã¾e wayes As honysoucles hongyng vppon eche half, Chesteynes and chiries Ã¾at children desiren Were loigged vndre leues ful lusty to seen. The havthorne so holsum I beheulde eeke, And hough Ã¾e benes blowid and Ã¾e brome-floures; Peris and plummes and pesecoddes grene, That ladies lusty loken muche after, Were gadrid for gomes ere Ã¾ay gunne ripe; The grapes grovid a-grete in gardyns aboute, And oÃ¾er fruytz felefold in feldes and closes; To nempne alle Ã¾e names hit nedith not here. The conyngz fro couert courid Ã¾e bankes And raughte oute a raundon and retournyd agaynes, Pleyed forth on Ã¾e playne, and to Ã¾e pitte after, But any hovnd hente Ã¾aym or Ã¾e hay-nettes. The hare hied hym faste and Ã¾e hovndes after; For kisshyng of his croupe a-caunt-wise he wente, For nad he tournyd twies his tail had be licked, So ernestly Ector ycchid hym after. The shepe fro Ã¾e sunne shadued Ã¾aymself, While Ã¾e lambes laikid a-long by Ã¾e heigges. The cow with hire calfe and coltes ful faire And high hors in haras hurtelid to-gedre, And preisid Ã¾e pasture Ã¾at prime-saute Ã¾aym made. The dere on Ã¾e dale drowe to Ã¾aire dennes, Ferkid forth to Ã¾e ferne and feulle dovne amyddes. Hertz and hyndes, a hunthrid to-gedre, With rayndeer and roobuc runne to Ã¾e wodes, For Ã¾e kenettz on Ã¾e cleere were vn-y-couplid; And buckes ful burnysshid Ã¾at baren good grece, Foure hunthrid on a herde y-heedid ful faire, Layen lowe in a launde a-long by Ã¾e pale, A swete sight for souurayns, so me God helpe. I moued dovne fro Ã¾e mote to Ã¾e midwardz And so a-dovne to Ã¾e dale, dwelled I no longer, But suche a noise of nestlingz ne so swete notz I herde not Ã¾is halfe yere, ne so heuenely [sounes] As I dide on Ã¾at dale adovne among Ã¾e heigges, For in euery bussh was a brid Ã¾at in his beste wise Bablid with his bile, Ã¾at blisse was to hire. So [cheerly] Ã¾ay chirmed and chaunged Ã¾aire notes, That what for flauour of Ã¾e fruyte and of Ã¾e somer floures, The smellyng smote as spices, me Ã¾ought, That of my trauail treuly toke I no kepe, For al was vanesshid me fro Ã¾orough Ã¾e fresshe sightes. Thenne lepte I forth lightly and lokid a-boute, And I beheulde a faire hovs with halles and chambres, A frankeleyn-is fre-holde al fresshe newe. I bente me aboute and bode atte dore Of Ã¾e gladdest gardyn Ã¾at gome euer had. I haue no tyme treuly to telle alle Ã¾e names Of ympes and herbes and oÃ¾er feele thinges That growed on Ã¾at gardyn, Ã¾e grounde was so noble. I passid ynne pryuely and pulled of Ã¾e fruytes And romed Ã¾aleys rovnde al a-boute, But so semely a sage as I sawe Ã¾ere I sawe not sothely sith I was bore, An olde auncyen man of a hunthrid wintre, Y-wedid in white cloÃ¾e and wisely y-made, With hore heres on his heede more Ã¾anne half white, A faire visaige and a vresse and vertuous to [sene]. His eyen were al ernest, eggid to noon ille, With a broode besmet berde ballid a lite, As comely a creature as euer kinde wrought. He was sad of his semblant, softe of his speche, Proporcioned at alle poyntes and pithy in his tyme, And by his stature right stronge, and stalworth on his dayes. He houed ouer a hyue, Ã¾e hony forto kepe Fro dranes Ã¾at destrued hit and dide not elles; He thraste Ã¾aym with his thumbe as Ã¾icke as Ã¾ay come, He lafte noon a-live for Ã¾aire lither taicches. I wondrid on his workes as I wel might, And euer I neyed hym nere as ney as me ought, And halsid hym hendily as I had lernyd; And he me grete agayne right in a goode wise, And askid what I wolde and anone I tolde My wil was to wite what man he were. âI am gardyner of Ã¾is [garth],â cothe he, âÃ¾e grovnde is myn owen, Forto digge and to delue and to do suche deedes As longeth to Ã¾is ley?ttone Ã¾e lawe wol I doo, And wrote vp Ã¾e wedes Ã¾at wyrwen my plantes; And wormes Ã¾at worchen not but wasten my herbes, I daisshe Ã¾aym to deeth and delue oute Ã¾aire dennes.

For of alle Ã¾e bestes Ã¾at breden vppon erthe For qualite ne quantite, n[o] question, I trowe The bee in his bisynes beste is allowed, And prouyd in his propriete passing alle oÃ¾er, And pretiest in his wirching to profite of Ã¾e peuple.â âSwete sire,â sayde I in slepe as me thoughte, âThe propriete of bees I pray Ã¾at ye wolde Declare with Ã¾aire deedes, and of Ã¾e drane eeke.â âBlethely, burne, Ã¾y beede shal bee doo Yf Ã¾ou wil tende treuly my tale to Ã¾ende.

Now feithfully, my ful frende, I wol not feyne to Ã¾e; There is no wronge on Ã¾is world wrought, as I wene, Treason noÃ¾er trespas ne trouble Ã¾at falleth, Felonye ne falshede ne no faute elles, Rancune ne riotte ne reuyng of peuple, Courshidnes ne cumbrance ne no caste of guile, That Mvm nys Ã¾e maker and moste cause eeke. And Ã¾at shal I shewe Ã¾e by exemples y-nowe; For Lucifer Ã¾e lyer Ã¾at lurketh aboute Forto gete hym a grounde Ã¾at he may graffe on And to sowe of his seede suche as he vsith, That groweth al to grevance and gurdyng of heedes, He leyeth his lynes along Ã¾at luste may be clepid Of oure foule flessh Ã¾at foundrith ful ofte, And of gloire of Ã¾is grounde his griefz been y-made, That who be hent in his hoke he shal be holde faste Til he [be] caste with couetise or sum croke elles.

But seche what he seche wol and asaye eeke, There is no sothe-sigger Ã¾at wol assent to hym, But conseilleth hym [Ã¾e] contrary and construeth Ã¾e doutes And poynteth hym Ã¾e perillz and pleynely telleth As a sicour seruant, and sheweth hym Ã¾e happes. He shoneth for no salaire ne soulde Ã¾at he fangeth, Ne [for no] likerous lyuelode ne loising of his office, That he ne telleth Ã¾e tirant how hit tourne wol Hamward by his hows and harme most hymself. Thenne fleeth he fro his frend and to his foo tourneth, For til he mete with Mvm may he neuer reste. He wol abide with no burne Ã¾at botene hym wolde Ne a-rayne hym arere with reason-is bridel, So loueth he go large to lepe where hym liketh, And kiketh faste as a colte Ã¾at casteth downe hymsilf, And fondeth forto finde Ã¾is freeke I haue nempnyd, That fayne is to folowe hym for fees and robes. Thenne meteth he with Mvm and his matiere sheweth, That shortly assentith as a shrewed hyne, And spareth for no spurnyng, but spedith Ã¾e matiere, And wircheth vp with wiles a walle of deceiptes, Til Ã¾e fals fundement falle atte laste, That Ã¾ay stumblen after stroutyng and stappen no ferther, But lyen dovne on Ã¾e diche as wel nygh y-doluen, Bothe Ã¾e maister and his man y-murid at oones.

For he provid by profitable poyntz and fele That Ã¾e sothe-sigger shuld haue Ã¾e better Of Mvm, and Ã¾e maistrie, malgre his chekes. He made Mvm a man-sleer and a-mys thewed And likenyd hym to a lorel atte long goyng. And shortly [hit] sheweth right so by Ã¾ayr werkes To clercz of conceipte Ã¾at construen Ã¾aire workes. He chargid me [cheerly] to change not myn intent Til Ã¾e matire of Mvm were made to Ã¾ende, And Ã¾at I shuld seye sothe and sette no dreede Of no creature of clay, for Criste so hym taughte. And Ã¾ough sum men of sweuenes sauery but lite, Yit Ã¾e lore of Ã¾e lude shal like me euer, For Daniel in his dayes declarid ful ofte Dreemes and vndide Ã¾aym as deede provid after; And Ioseph Ã¾e gentil Genesis Ã¾ou saye (The bible bereth witnesse, a boke of bilieue), He mette Ã¾at Ã¾e mone and elleuen sterres With Ã¾e shynant sunne soudaynely at oones A-bowid to his bidding bonairely, hym thought, And dide hym worship Ã¾erewith Ã¾at wroth made after His brethern Ã¾at bisied Ã¾aym to bringe hym of dawe. Hit semyd by his sweuene Ã¾ay sayden Ã¾o among Ã¾aym, Shuld falle Ã¾at Ã¾ayr fadre and Ã¾ay been fayne eeke To mete hym with Ã¾ayre modre in a muke wise, And pray hym in his pouaire pite forto haue Of Ã¾aym and Ã¾aym helpe fro hungre and elles. And so hit feulle sothely Ã¾ay sought hym Ã¾erafter Ernestly in Egipte or elles Ã¾e boke lieth, For hunger Ã¾at Ã¾ay hadde and helpe couthe Ã¾ay none But lowely to loute his lordship to sike, Forto graunt of his grayn what hym good likid That for faute of Ã¾ayr fode famyne long durid. And so hit semeth in certayne Ã¾at sum bee right trewe And sothe of Ã¾ees sweuenes of sobre men wittes, And prouen ofte to Ã¾e poynt of pourpoos in deede. And Ã¾erefore my doute and dreede is Ã¾e lasse To do Ã¾at Ã¾e burne bade, Ã¾at Ã¾e bees kepte, [Forto saye sumwhat of svth er I passe] How Ã¾e greete of Ã¾is ground been y-gouuerned. Thenne softe I Ã¾e soores to serche Ã¾aym withynne, And seurely to salue Ã¾aym and with a newe salue That Ã¾e sothe-sigger hath sought many yeres And mighte not mete Ã¾erewith for Mvm and his ferys That bare a-weye Ã¾e bagges and many a boxe eeke. Now for[to] conseille Ã¾e king vnknytte I a bagge Where many a pryue poyse is preyntid withynne Yn bokes vnbredid in balade-wise made, Of vice and of vertue fulle to Ã¾e margyn, That was not y-openyd Ã¾is oÃ¾er half wintre. There is a quayer of quitances of quethyn goodes, That bisshoppz han begged to binde al newe, And a penyworth of papir of penys Ã¾at Ã¾ay fongen For lemmans and lotebies in Ã¾ees late dayes, And lien on Ã¾e lettrure, for lawe was hit neuer. There is a volume of visitacion of viftene leves How persones and prestis been y-passid ouer Thorough fauour of fangyng and no faute amendid, But liggen at London in lorden courtz And pleyen lille for lalle with many levde [kitte]. Thay lusten for to lerne of lettrure no ferÃ¾er Thenne to Ã¾e lesson of laudate al Ã¾aire life-dayes, Forto preche Ã¾aire parroisshe how Pernelle is arayed And with Ã¾e tolle of Ã¾e tithing fetisly a-tired. Thay been losers of Ã¾e lawe and lewde men maken The bolder for Ã¾aire badnes and breke Ã¾e tenne hestes. There is a rolle of religion, how Ã¾ay Ã¾aire rentz hadde Forto parte with Ã¾e poure a parcelle oÃ¾er-while, But Ã¾ay been rotid in a rewe to refresshe greete, To maynteyne Ã¾ayre manhode and matieres Ã¾ay haue to doo For pleding and for pourchas, to pasture Ã¾aym Ã¾e swetter, So poure Ã¾ay been and penylees sith Ã¾e pestilence tyme. Yit is Ã¾ere a paire of pamphilettz of prelatz of Ã¾e royaulme Yn Ã¾e bottume of Ã¾e bagge, how boldely Ã¾ay ride, Thees persones and Ã¾ees prebendiers pluralite Ã¾at hauen, [Poperyng] on Ã¾aire palefrays fro oone place to an other, And lernen to lede ladies and lewed men envien To do al Ã¾ing as Ã¾ay do as by Ã¾aire deedes proueth. Thay autorisen with argumentz and allegen for Ã¾aym That of oon kinde alle came Ã¾ere can no [man] seye oÃ¾er. Thus leden Ã¾ay Ã¾aire lyves in lustes and in sportes, And spenden on Ã¾aire speciales Ã¾at Ã¾ay spare shuld For pouraile of Ã¾aire parroishens and present to be among Ã¾aym Forto salue Ã¾aire shepe whenne Ã¾ay sike were. But how shuld a surgean serue wel his hyre That cometh not in seuene yere to se Ã¾e sore oones, That Ã¾ay shal not se oon shyne how soutelly Ã¾ay wirchen. I say not but of sum Ã¾at suche manieres vsen, For euery wyman Ã¾at is wise, she wircheth to Ã¾e beste And conseilleth al to conscience leste Ã¾ere come happes. Yit is Ã¾ere a copie for comunes of culmes foure and twenty How sum tellen tidingz at home vppon Ã¾aire benches, Or elles at eue after souper or erely atte nale, And lyen on Ã¾e lordz,âlorelles and noon other. Thaire tales been so trouble Ã¾at tournen men thoughtz; The more Ã¾at men musen on Ã¾aym, Ã¾e madder Ã¾ay been after. I mervail but Ã¾ay mette so how hit might be That Ã¾ay finde fables and been so ferre fro Ã¾ens That Ã¾ough Ã¾ou ride rennyng, and reste but a lite, Fro London forth Ã¾e long waye to Ã¾e land-is ende, And comes right fro Ã¾e king-is courte and his cunseil bothe, Fro prelatz vnto peris in pryuete or elles, Yit shal tidingz bee y-tolde tenne dayes ere Ã¾ou come, That neuer was of worde spoke ne wroughte, as Ã¾ou shal hire. Lesingz been so light of fote, Ã¾ay lepen by Ã¾e skyes, And as swifte as a swalue sheutyng ovte at oones As falsly forgid as Ã¾ough a frere had made Ã¾aym. That harde happes mote Ã¾ay haue Ã¾at Henry so appeiren, Or any lord of Ã¾is lande Ã¾at loueth pees and reste, Though Ã¾e burne my broÃ¾er were, I bid hit with my herte. Yit wol Ã¾ay carpe of Ã¾e coroune as Ã¾ay of cunseil were, And ordeyne more in oon houre Ã¾an other half wintre Al Ã¾e king-is cunseil couthe wel bringe aboute. Thus mellen Ã¾ay with matieres to moustre Ã¾aire wittes, And grucchen whenne Ã¾e gadryng is Ã¾at goeth for vs alle. I seye yf hit be sette so and in suche Ã¾inges, Ful ille couthe Ã¾ay corde with Changwys-is deedes, That conquerid many a cuntre as king withynne hymself; And how he came to his coroune I shal you kenne sone. The greete God of goodnes Ã¾at gouuerneth alle Ã¾ingz, He nempned furst his name to Ã¾e seuene nacions That were wel nygh destrued and disware of Ã¾aire lives And in disease and desperat Ã¾orough Ã¾aire double intentz. Thaire diuision dide Ã¾aym harme (and so hit doeth elleswhere), That Ã¾ay were sette in seruitute by souurayns of Ã¾e marches That had y-wonne and y-wastid wel nygh alle Ã¾e landz. The principal of Ã¾is peuple pryuyly by nightz A voice Ã¾aym folowed [in vision] in fourthering of Ã¾aymself, And bade Ã¾aym coroune Changwys king of al Ã¾aire peuple, A eildren man of aunsetrie Ã¾at aged was a lite. And so Ã¾e deede was y-do when day and tyme came after, And when Ã¾is Changwys was y-corouned as cronicle of hym telleth, And sette in his se with sceptre on his handes, He stablid two statutz, as storie of hym writeth, I herde neuer harder and yit Ã¾ay holde were. The furst Ã¾at he funded to fele trewe hertz And his principal peuple to proue and a-saye, Was Ã¾at Ã¾e souurayns of Ã¾e seuene nacions Shuld sle Ã¾ayre soones Ã¾eldest and Ã¾aire hoires; The secund Ã¾at Ã¾ay shuld eeke sese hym in hire [lande] And yelde hit vp in erniste and yeue hit hym for euer, To haue and to holde in his high grace. And as Ã¾e king commandid accordid Ã¾ay were, Consentyng to his couetise with crie alle at oones. Thay sparid not to spille blode Ã¾at spronge of Ã¾aymself, Ne to lose Ã¾ayre lordship and lande at his wille. Now forto telle trouthe, I trowe hit be no lesing, Who wolde haue griefed for a grote he wold haue grucched Ã¾ere. Thus proued Ã¾is prince his [peuple] and Ã¾aire hertz, And to feil of Ã¾aire fiance ful felly he wroughte; And [whenne he] wiste Ã¾at his wil was not encountrid, But Ã¾at he had Ã¾aire hertz al hoole at his wil, He forgafe Ã¾aym Ã¾aire graunt and goodely Ã¾aym Ã¾anked. Thenne clepid he to cunseil knightz and other, And wroughte alle with oon wil as wise men shuld, And wanne wisely ayen withynne a while after The lande and Ã¾e lordship Ã¾at Ã¾ay loste had, And conquerid cuntrees, as Cathay-is lande, That is the richeste royaulme Ã¾at reyne ouer houeth. Now by Crist Ã¾at me creed, I can not be-Ã¾enke A kindely cause why Ã¾e comun shuld Contre Ã¾e king-is wil ne construe his werkes. I carpe not of knightz Ã¾at cometh for Ã¾e shires, That Ã¾e king clepith to cunseil with oÃ¾er; But hit longeth to no laborier Ã¾e lawe is agayne Ã¾aym. And yit hit is y-vsid with vnwise peuple And a-vailleth not a ferÃ¾ing, but vireth Ã¾e hertz; And tournen with Ã¾aire tales Ã¾e tente of Ã¾e lordes, That Ã¾ay leven Ã¾e labour Ã¾e londe to defende, To bisye Ã¾aym on Ã¾e bordures to bete oute oure foes, And maynteyne Ã¾e marches fro myschief and elles. Thus clappeth Ã¾e comun and knocketh Ã¾aymself, For Ã¾e [tayl] of Ã¾aire talking teneth Ã¾aym ofte. Thou mays lerne Ã¾at lesson in Ã¾e nexte lyne, For and Ã¾y heede be hurte Ã¾y [honde] wol apeire; And who-so hewe ouer heede Ã¾ough his hoode be on, The spones wol springe oute and spare not Ã¾e eye. Thay finde many fautes and faillen moste Ã¾aymself Of deedes of deuete that Ã¾ay do shuld. Thay shulde loue loyally Ã¾e lordz aboute, That Ã¾ay mighte lerne a lesson of Ã¾aire lowe hertz To reule Ã¾aym by reason and by right lawe. Thay shuld be reedy to ride and renne at Ã¾ayre heste For soulde and for siluer as Ã¾ay might a-serue, And obeye to Ã¾ayre bidding and bable no ferther, For suche lewed [labbing] Ã¾e lande doeth a-peire. But God of his goodnes graunt Ã¾aym to amende, To knowe what Ã¾aire kinde is and commenche bityme The cunseille of Changwys and construe no ferther, But loue so oure liege al oure life-dayes That he may leede vs with loue as hymself liketh. There is a scrowe for squyers Ã¾at a-square walken Whenne a tale is y-tolde, yf hit touche greete That piled han poure men of penys and of goodes; Thay wol neghen no neer but yf Ã¾ay noye Ã¾enke And alleigge for Ã¾e lord and lawe dovne bere, Leste soulde and Ã¾aire seruice cesse al at ones, Thus poure men pleyntz been pledid ful ofte, For reason-is retenue moste reste nedis There robes rehercyn Ã¾e rightz of Ã¾e parties. There is a writte of high wil y-write al newe, Y-knytte in a cornier of Ã¾e bagge-ende, And is a courssid couraige and coste-ful bothe That serueth al for souurayns of semblable pouaire; For euer egalite errith and stryueth More Ã¾anne Ã¾e [mene] man with his more heigher For whenne a matiere is y-moeved among men of goode, Though Ã¾ere happe no harme saue her[tz] aggreiggid, Thay stele into strivyng and strien Ã¾aym-self And stiren so Ã¾at stuffure and store doon apeire, And eeke losen Ã¾aire good loos with Ã¾aire lewed pride, And annoyen Ã¾aire neighborowes nyne myle aboute. For euery feithful frend wol funde to helpe And leue Ã¾ere he loueth, for lothe or elles; Suche wilfulnes and wisedame wonen a-sunder. Thou mays baathe on a brooke to Ã¾e breggurdelle; But passe not Ã¾e polle forÃ¾er for peril Ã¾at foloweth. Thus (seyeth Ã¾at oon side) shule [I] obeye Or make amendes or mukyn myself? Nay, are I worke suche a worke but my witte faille, Hit shuld stande right straite with stoone of my hovses, For leuer Ã¾enne to lowe me while my life dureth I wol do a deede Ã¾at I dide neuer, Sille for siluer my sherte and my clothes, Or borowe til I begge thenne bowe oones. [And] I were caste in my cuntre and hit knowe were, I shuld be [eschewid] and ouer-sette ofte. Ney, I wol maynteyne my manhoode, maul-greÃ¾at gruccheth, And spare swete spices and spende on my foes. That other side seyeth right so and Ã¾e same wordes, As wilde [and] as wode and as wrothe eeke, And braggeth and bosteth and wol brenne watiers And rather renne in rede blode Ã¾enne a-rere oones. Thus Ã¾ay blowe as a bore til bothe repente. Hit is no witte, as I wene, to waste so siluer For a woode wil and wretthe in Ã¾y herte, And no harme on Ã¾y heede in [lande] ne in goodes, But y-hurte on Ã¾e hert with a high pride. For suche maniere medling al to many tymes, Though hit gaine in Ã¾e bigynnyng, hit groweth so aftre That lymes been y-loste and lyfes ful ofte. And eeke hit is no wordly witte, as me Ã¾enketh, To toille Ã¾ere no trespas is do to a-countz. But hit semeth to a souurayn Ã¾at ynnesight lacketh, Whenne his mynde is y-moevid to medle in his ire, That Ã¾ough his grovnde be not goode and he gaste were Or feynte forto folowe but fersse to Ã¾ende, Hit shuld be [aretted] for reprouf whenne hit were rehercyd, And he y-sette Ã¾e shorter at shire and a-boute. Suche cursid construyng accombreth Ã¾e [peuple]. For [cuntre] Ã¾at conceipt I can make a reason, And a trewe, as I trowe, who-so taketh hede: Whenne rancune Ã¾e redeth to reere debatz, Or angre at attre arteth Ã¾y herte Forto commenche a cause not cleere in Ã¾e winde, Bowe ere Ã¾ou breste whenne Ã¾ou arte bette y-fourmyd, And revle Ã¾e by reason and renne not to faste, But gife hit vp with good wille whenne Ã¾y grovnde failleth, And falle of with fayrenes leste fors Ã¾e assaille. For yf Ã¾ou leue are Ã¾ou ligge Ã¾enne wol Ã¾y loos springe, But yf Ã¾y tale be trewe, to toylle Ã¾ou hatis. So wol Ã¾e worde walke with oon and with oÃ¾er And cumforte Ã¾y cuntre in cumpas aboute To be nere at Ã¾y nede a-noÃ¾er tyme after, And bilieue loyally, in lawe yf Ã¾ou were, Or medlist with a matiere, Ã¾y more were trewe, Elles woldes Ã¾ou not worche on hit longe. There is a raggeman rolle Ã¾at Ragenelle hymself Hath made of mayntennance and motyng of Ã¾e peuple, Hough Ã¾ay sheue at sises and sessions aboute, And halen so Ã¾e hockerope oon halfe agayne oÃ¾er Til Ã¾e strong[est] steriers and styuest on Ã¾e heedes Haue haled Ã¾e howslord oute atte halle-dore. Strifen so and streicchen streight adovne Ã¾e poure. Gold and good Ã¾aym glewith so Ã¾ay wol not go a-sundre [Til Ã¾ay haue] drawen hym clene fro his dees he dysneth Ã¾ere nomore. This same cursid custume Ã¾e coroune doeth a-peyre And bringeth a bitter byworde a-brode among Ã¾e peuple, And is in euery cuntre but a comune tale That yf Ã¾e pouer playne, Ã¾ough he plede euer And hurleth with his higher hit happeth ofte-tyme That he wircheth al in waste and wynneth but a lite. Thus laboreth Ã¾e loos among Ã¾e comune peuple That Ã¾e wacker in Ã¾e writte wol haue Ã¾e wors ende; Hit wol not gayne a goky a grete man forto plede, For lawe lieth muche in lordship sith loyaute was exiled, And poure men pleyntes penylees a-bateth. But Dauid demed not so, I do hit on his bokes. Yit is Ã¾ere a forelle Ã¾at I forgate Ã¾at frayed is a lite, How Ã¾e [fleuble] fareth Ã¾at folowed bee in shires Whenne Ã¾ay griefen greete, Ã¾ough Ã¾e guilte be lite. And he haue any hors or elles hedid bestes, He shal be hourled so in high courte and holde so agogge That hym were bettre lose his lande Ã¾enne long so be toylid; Suche crokes been y-courid and coloured vnder lawe, To strue a man with [strength] Ã¾e status been so made. For Ã¾ough men pleede and poursuye and in Ã¾aire playntz falle And newe Ã¾aym aftre nonsuyte[s] nynetene hunthred, Withoute grovnde or guilte but forto gete a bribe, Yit shal Ã¾ay haue no harme Ã¾ough Ã¾ay hurle euer. But shuld Ã¾ay picche and paye at eche pleynte-is ende And compte alle Ã¾e costz of men of court and elles, And taske al Ã¾e trespas as trouthe wolde and reason, Thay wolde cesse sum tyme for sheding of Ã¾aire siluer. I seye aswel of simple men Ã¾at suen ayenst grete, And of Ã¾e poure proute Ã¾at peyren ofte Ã¾aire better, That causelees accusen Ã¾aym to king and to Ã¾e lordz, As I doo of ducz Ã¾at suche deedes vsen; For lordz and laborers been not like in costes. Hit wold pese Ã¾e peuple and many pleyntes bate And chaunge al Ã¾e chauncellerie and cheuallerie amende And ease be to euery man Ã¾at been of euene states, And solas be to souurayns and to Ã¾aire seruantz alle, And a miracle to meen men Ã¾at mote lite cunne, Were Ã¾is oon yere y-vsid as I haue declarid,â That of euery writte withoute wronge Ã¾ere were amendes made, And paye for alle Ã¾e costes at euery pleynte-is ende, And tolle for Ã¾e trespas as trouthe wolde and reasonâ The lawe wold like vs wel, and euer Ã¾e lenger Ã¾e bettre. But pouaire of prerogatife Ã¾at poynt hath reseruyd That euery fode haue fredome to folowe vn-y-punysshid. But ciuile seith vs not so Ã¾at serueth for al peuple That habiteth vndre heuene hethen men and oÃ¾er. And Crist-is lawe-is y-canonized canon, yf Ã¾ou loke, And eeke Ã¾e glorious gospelle grovnde of alle lawes, Techeth vs a trewe texte Ã¾at toucheth Ã¾is ilke matiere; For in my conscience ne in my credo yit couthe I neuer vele But Ã¾at oure lawe leneth Ã¾ere a lite, as me Ã¾enketh. There is a librarie of lordes Ã¾at losen ofte Ã¾aym-self Thorough lickyng of Ã¾e lordship Ã¾at to Ã¾e coroune longeth, And weneth hit be wel y-do but wors dide Ã¾ay neuer Thenne sith Ã¾ay gunne Ã¾at game, I grovnde me on reason. For euery wighte wote wel but yf his witte faille, That hit is holsum forto haue a heede of vs alle, That is a king y-corouned to kepe vs vnder lawe, To put vs into prisone whenne we passe boundes. For but we had a souurayn to sette vs into reste, Thees rechelees renkes wolde renne on eche oÃ¾er. Thenne of fyne fors hit foloweth, as me Ã¾enketh, That a certayne substance shuld be ordeynid To susteyne Ã¾is souurayn Ã¾at shuld vs gouerne. And so I wote wel hit was atte furst tyme, But now hit is bynome hym Ã¾olde and Ã¾e newe, Not-wi[th]standing statutz ful strattely y-made To stable many statutz and strong lawes make. But execucion falle what may hit availle Ne more Ã¾enne Ã¾e mose may or Ã¾e maij floures To breke dovne bastiles Ã¾at beste is y-made. Hit is as dede as a dore nayle, Ã¾ough Ã¾e dome come after, Withoute execucion Ã¾ees wise men hit knoweth. Thees knightz of Ã¾e conseil Ã¾at nygh Ã¾e king dwellen, And eeke lordz y-lettred of oone lawe and oÃ¾er, Forto kepe his coroune fro couetous peuple, Han pulled Ã¾aym-self Ã¾e peres right to Ã¾e [pure] stalke, And lickid so Ã¾e leves he hath Ã¾e leste dele, For Ã¾ay holden of his honour halfendele and more. This was grovnde and bigynnyng of gurdyng of heedes, And eeke more [of] mourdre and many-folde wronges That han y-falle for foly withynne Ã¾ees fourty wintre. For Ã¾egre enuye Ã¾at eche had to oÃ¾er Dide Ã¾aym preece to be pryvy and put aweye Ã¾e beste, But muche more for Ã¾e mede to make Ã¾aym-self riche Thenne to cunseille Ã¾e king of Ã¾e comune [wele], Or for any deue dome or defence of Ã¾e royaulm[e] This same cursid custume oure coroune hath a-p[ayred], And cause is most Ã¾at comunes collectours haten, For nedis moste oure liege lord like his estat Haue for his houshold and for his [haynous werres] To maynteyne his manhoode Ã¾ere may no man seye o[Ã¾er], But of his owen were Ã¾e beste, who-so couthe hit bringg[e]; To lyve vppon his laboriers, hit may not long indure. Whenne hit is haled al awey Ã¾enne is wo Ã¾e nexte To you Ã¾at shullen siluer to solue Ã¾enne were tyme. For trusteth right treuly, talke what men likeÃ¾, And wendith and trendith twys in oon wike, And clepith to your cunseil copes and other, And pleyne atte parlement, but yf Ã¾e deede prouue That Ã¾e coroune in his kinde come ynne agaynes, Clene in his cumpas with croppes and braunches, Lite and a lite, right as Ã¾e lawe asketh, Wel mowe we wilne and wisshe what vs liketh And eeke waite after welthe but as my witte demeth, Oure wynnyng and worship wol be Ã¾e lasse With knight and with comune til Ã¾e king haue Alle hoole in his hande Ã¾at he haue oughte. There is a copie of couetise, how conscience is revled Whenne he [hath] gadrid a greete bagge and good at his wil, And wrongfully y-wonne hit Ã¾orough wiles of his hert, And is y-runne in riches Ã¾orough ryfling of Ã¾e peuple, He maketh maisons deu Ã¾erewith whenne he may live [no len]ger; But while he had power of Ã¾e penyes Ã¾e poure had but lite. Hit is a high holynes and grete helth to Ã¾e soule, A man to lyue in lustes alle his life-dayes And haue no pitie on Ã¾e poure, ne parte with Ã¾aym nother, But holde hit euer in his hande til Ã¾e herte breke. But Ã¾enne he shapeth for Ã¾e soule whenne Ã¾e sunne is dovne, But while Ã¾e day durid he delte but a lite; Now muche moste his merite be Ã¾at mendeth so Ã¾e poure, That gifeth his goode for God-is sake whenne his goste is pass[ed]. There is a [title] of testament[z] Ã¾at I tolde neuer, How pryuyly Ã¾ay been provid and y-put a-side, For so Ã¾e siluer be y-soluid for Ã¾e seel of Ã¾office And Ã¾e feis alle y-funge Ã¾ay folden Ã¾aym to-gedre And casten Ã¾aym in a coffre leste Ã¾ay copied were, And sith Ã¾ay seure Ã¾aym by Ã¾aymself and seyen Ã¾ees [wordes]: âHit is no wisedame forto wake Warrok while he sl[epeth]â For Ã¾ough a quynzieme were y-quethe oon quita[nce shal be geven] Though executours after-warde execute hit neu[er], [Ne do noght for] Ã¾e dede as I do whenne I slepe. [And yit] Ã¾ay seyen for Ã¾aymsilf right a subtile reason: â[Why sh]uld we dele for Ã¾e dede? He dide not while he mighte. [He] made vs in his mynde among alle his frendes [T]o be his trewe attourneys and treete for his debtes, [F]or so Ã¾at Ã¾ay haue halfendele Ã¾ay mowe Ã¾aym holde content. [Y]it wol not Ã¾e good go so ferre so mote we grovnde oure tale, For I wol seye for myself seye Ã¾ou whenne Ã¾e liketh, Yf we do as he dude, may no man deme vs yuel, Ne rightfully by reason reproue vs here-after. He was boÃ¾e ware and wise while he was on live, And me lust not be lewed leste I fare Ã¾e wors. His custume was to kepe his good so lete vs kepe hit eeke, And Ã¾enne after oure deeth day lete dele for vs alle, For oure executours aftre vs shal haue Ã¾e same charge.â Thus Ã¾ay chiden with charite and chacheth eche other, That til Ã¾e day of dome Ã¾e dele is not parfourmid. Yit is Ã¾ere a poynt of prophecie how Ã¾e peuple construeth And museth on Ã¾e meruailles Ã¾at Merlyn dide deuyse, And redith as right as Ã¾e Ram is hornyd, As helpe me Ã¾e high God, I holde Ã¾aym halfe a-masid. For Ã¾ere nys wight in Ã¾is world Ã¾at wote bifore eue How Ã¾e winde and Ã¾e wedre wol wirche on Ã¾e morowe, Ne noon so cunnyng a clerc Ã¾at construe wel couthe Ere sunneday a seuenyght what shal falle. Thus Ã¾ay muse on Ã¾e mase on mone and on sterres Til heedes been hewe of and hoppe on Ã¾e grene, And al Ã¾e wide world wondre on Ã¾aire workes. Yit sawe I Ã¾ere a cedule soutelly indited With tuly silke intachid right atte rolle-is ende, Y-write ful of wordes of woundres Ã¾at han falle, And fele-folde ferlees wythynne Ã¾ees fewe yeris, By cause Ã¾at Ã¾e clergie and knighthoode to-gedre Been not knytte in conscience as Crist dide Ã¾aym stable.
