      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS HIGHNESS PRINCE FREDERICK, BISHOP OF OSNABRUG, THESE HYMNS, COMPOSED FOR HIS AMUSEMENT, ARE With all due Submission and Respect, HUMBLY INSCRIBED TO HIM, AS THE BEST OF BISHOPS, BY HIS HIGHNESS's Most Obedient and Devoted Servant, The Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HYMN I. FAITH. I The Father of the Faithful said, At God's first calling, âHere am I;â Let us by his example sway'd, Like him submit, like him reply. II âGo take thy son, thine only son, âAnd offer him to God thy King.â The word was giv'nâthe work begun, âThe altar pile, the victim bring.â III But lo! th'angelic voice above Bade the great Patriarch stop his hands; âKnow God is everlasting love, âAnd must revoke such harsh commands.â IV Then let us imitate the Seer, And tender, with compliant grace, Ourselves, our souls, and children here, Hereafter in a better place. HYMN II. HOPE. I Ah! Hannah, why should'st thou despair, Quick to the Tabernacle speed; There on thy knees prefer thy pray'r, And there thy cause to mercy plead. II Her pious breathings now ascend, As from her heart the sighs she heaves; And angels to her suit attend, Till strong in hope she now conceives. III Then Samuel soon was brought to light To serve the Lord, as yet a childâ O what a heart-reviving sight! Sure Cherubims and Seraphs smil'd. IV Thus yet a child may I begin, To serve the Lord with all my heart; To shun the wily lures of sin, And claim the prize, or ere I start. HYMN III. CHARITY. I O queen of virtues, whose sweet pow'r Does o'er the first perfections tow'r, Sustaining in the arms of love All want below, all weal above. II With thee O let my thoughts conceive, For all the very best believe; Predict, pronounce for all the best, And be by bearing all things blest. III To suffer long and still be kind In holy temperance of mind, Rejoice that truth is on my side, As free from envy as from pride. IV Both tongues and prophecies shall cease, And painful knowledge cede to peace; And time and death o'er all prevail, But Charity shall never fail. V Then guide, O Christ, this little hand, To deal thy bounties round the land; To clothe and feed the hungry poor, And to the stranger ope my door. VI My cup of water, Christ, is free, For all that love and thirst for thee; With wisdom many a soul to win, And loose the irksome bonds of sin. VII Make me, O Christ, tho' yet a child, To virtue zealous, errors mild, Profess the feelings of a man, And be the Lord's Samaritan. HYMN IV. PRUDENCE. I O best oeconomist of life, Tho' all the passions were at strife; Yet thou, fair Prudence, could'st assuage The storm, and moderate its rage. II With Dove and Serpent at thy call, As caution'd by the Lord of all, Thou art in Christ full well aware, Of open force or secret snare. III To check thy thoughts divinely meek, To weigh thy words before you speak, To make the day's demand secure, To be the treas'rer of the poor: IV All these, Prudentia, these are thine, And God thro' Christ shall make them mine; To do my best till life shall end, Then on futurity depend. HYMN V. JUSTICE. I O let not fraud 'gainst me prevail, My God, my Christ avow'd; Which weigh'st the mountains in thy scale, And ballancest the cloud. II And still peculiar on my side, Keep me from rigour free; Make me forgive in manly pride, All that exact on me. III Pay my demander more than due, With measure heap'd and press'd; And rather welcome than pursue, My brother when distress'd. IV O give me sense and grace to know Thy will, and check my own; In heav'n above, in earth below, The Lord is judge alone. HYMN VI. MERCY. I O sweetâattentive to the pray'r, Ye forward hope and stave despair; Thro' Christ his blood divinely spill'd, Tremendous ruin to rebuild. II Tho' high above the great and just, Yet thou descendest to the dust; Both to the sovereign and the slave, Nor quitt'st the monument and grave. III O let me like the righteous die, And so I shall if thou art by! The viol in thy hand uprears My Saviour's blood, my Saviour's tears. IV Come, Cherub, come, possess my soul, All wrath and bitterness controul; If thou thy charming pow'rs bestow, I'll shew thee to my veriest foe. HYMN VII. TEMPERANCE. I For forty days the Lord abstain'd, (The subtle tempter near) And greatly every bait disdain'd, Self-aw'd and self-severe. II This is the pattern that I set, To keep the flesh in awe; I will not gross desires abet, Withdraw, soul fiend, withdraw. III The fiend withdrew, the Angels came, And worship'd at his feet; âO great Jehovah, word and name âInestimably sweet! IV âHow cou'd that cursed serpent dare, âThine honour to offend?â Says Christ, a little while forbear, 'Tis for a glorious end. V O may I keep the body cool, By fasting on my knees; And follow strict religion's rule, Those days the church decrees. VI Keep, keep intemp'rance far away, 'Tis duty and 'tis love; Or how shall I my breast display, To nest my Saviour's dove. HYMN VIII. FORTITUDE. I Stand fast, my child, and after all, Yet still stand fast, says holy Paul, Thy resolution be renew'd, For this is Christian Fortitude. II Repeat the Lord's own pray'r for grace, At ev'ry hour in ev'ry place; Spring up from human to divine, For strength invincible is thine. III Then, as the great Apostle saith, 'Bove all things take the shield of Faith, Salvation's helm, and for thy sword, E'en God's good Spirit and his Word. IV And now in dang'rous giddy youth, Your loins be girt about with Truth; Your feet with Gospel-peace be shod, Your breast-plate Righteousness from God. V When to the ghostly fight alarm'd, Know, soldier, thou'rt completely arm'd, And free from terror or dismay, March on, engage, and win the day. HYMN IX. MODERATION. I Tho' I my party long have chose, And claim Christ Jesus on my side, Yet will I not my peace oppose, By pique, by prejudice, or pride. II Blessed be God, that, at the font, My sponsors bound me to the call Of Christ in England to confront The world, the flesh, the fiend and all. III And yet I will my thoughts suppress, And keep my tongue from censure clear; The Jew, the Turk, the Heathen bless, And hold the plough and persevere. IV There's God in ev'ry man most sure, And ev'ry soul's to Christ allied; If fears deject, if hopes allure, If Jesus wept, and pray'd, and died. HYMN X. TRUTH. I 'Tis thus the holy Scriptures ends, âWhoever loves or makes a lie, âOn heav'ns felicity depends âIn vain, for he shall surely die.â II The stars, the firmament, the sun, God's glorious work, God's great design, All, all was finish'd as begun, By rule, by compass, and by line. III Hence David unto heav'n appeals, âYe heav'ns his righteousness declare;â His signet their duration seals, And bids them be as firm, as fair. IV Then give me grace, celestial Sire, The truth to love, the truth to tell; Let everlasting sweets aspire, And filth and falshood sink to hell. HYMN XI. BEAUTY. For a Damsel. I Christ, keep me from the self-survey Of beauties all thine own; If there is beauty, let me pray And praise the Lord alone. II Prayâthat I may the fiend withstand, Where'er his serpents be; Praiseâthat the Lord's almighty hand Is manifest in me. III Is is not soâmy features are Much meaner than the rest; A glow-worm cannot be a star, And I am plain at best. IV Then come, my love, thy grace impart, Great Saviour of mankind; O come, and purify my heart, And beautify my mind. V Then will I thy carnations nurse, And cherish every rose; And empty to the poor my purse, Till grace to glory grows. HYMN XII. HONESTY. I I have a house, the house of prayer, (No spy beneath my eaves) And purring gratitude is there, And he that frights the thieves. II If I of honesty suspend My judgment, making doubt, I have a good domestic friend, That soon shall point it out. III 'Tis to be faithful to my charge, And thankful for my place, And pray that God my pow'rs enlarge, To act with greater grace. IV To give my brother more than due, In talent or in name; Nor e'en mine enemy pursue, To hurt, or to defame. V Nay, more to bless him and to pray, Mine anger to controul; And give the wages of the day To him, that hunts my soul. HYMN XIII. ELEGANCE. I 'Tis in the spirit that attire, Th'investiture of saints in heav'n, Those robes of intellectual fire, Which to the great elect are giv'n. II âBring out to my returning son, âThe robes for elegance the best;â Thus in the height it shall be done, And thus the penitent be blest. III 'Tis in the body, that sweet mien, Ingenuous Christians all possess, Grace, easy motions, smiles serene, Clean hands and seemliness of dress. IV Whoever has thy charming pow'rs, Is amiable as Kidron's David. swan, Like holy Esdras feeds on flow'rs, And lives on honey like St. John. HYMN XIV. LOVELINESS. I Good-nature is thy sterling name, Yet loveliness is English too; Sweet disposition, whose bright aim, Is to the mark of Jesus true. II I've seen thee in an homely face, Excel by pulchritude of mind; To ill-form'd features give a grace, Serene, benevolent and kind. III 'Tis when the spirit is so great, That it the body still controuls, As godly inclinations meet, In sweet society of souls. IV It is that condescending air, Where perfect willingness is plain, To smile assent, to join in pray'r, And urg'd a mile to go it twain. V To grant at once the boon preferr'd, By contrite foe, or needy friend; To be obliging is the word, And God's good blessing is the end. HYMN XV. TASTE. I O guide my judgment and my taste, Sweet SPIRIT, author of the book Of wonders, told in language chaste, And plainness not to be mistook. II O let me muse, and yet at sight The page admire, the page believe; âLet there be light, and there was light, âLet there be Paradise and Eve!â III Who his soul's rapture can refrain? At Joseph's ever-pleasing tale, Of marvels, the prodigious train, To Sinai's hill from Goshen's vale. IV The Psalmist and proverbial Seer, And all the prophets' sons of song, Make all things precious, all things clear, And bear the brilliant word along. V O take the book from off the shelf, And con it meekly on thy knees; Best panegyric on itself, And self-avouch'd to teach and please. VI Respect, adore it heart and mind, How greatly sweet, how sweetly grand! Who reads the most, is most refin'd, And polish'd by the Master's hand. HYMN XVI. LEARNING. I Come, come with emulative strife, To learn the way, the truth, and life, Which Jesus is in one; In all sound doctrine he proceeds, From Alpha to Omega leads, E'en Spirit, Sire, and Son. II Sure of th'exceeding great reward, Midst all your learning learn the Lordâ This was thy doctrine, Paul; And this thy lecture shou'd persuade, Tho' thou hadst more of human aid, Than thy blest brethren all. III Humanity's a charming thing, And every science of the ring, Good is the classic lore; For these are helps along the road, That leads to Zion's blest abode, And heav'nly muse's store. IV But greater still in each respect, He that communicates direct The tutor of the soul; Who without pain, degrees or parts, While he illuminates our hearts, Can teach at once the whole. HYMN XVII. PRAISE. I Tho' conscience void of all offence, Is man's divinest praise, A godly heart-felt innocence, Which does at first by grace commence, By supplication stays: II Yet I do love my brother's laud, In each attempt to please; O may he frequently applaud, âGood child, thou soon shalt go abroad, âOr have such things as these.â III âThis silver coin'd by sweet queen Anne, âThis nose-gay and these toys, âThou this gilt Testament shalt scan, âThis pictur'd Hymn-book on a plan, âTo make good girls and boys.â IV O may they give, before I ask, Suggest before desire, While in the summer-house I bask, The little lab'rer at his task, Is worthy of his hire. HYMN XVIII. PRAYER. I Pray without ceasing (says the Saint) Nor ever in the spirit faint; With grace the bloom and faith the root, The pray'r shall bring eternal fruit. II When the great Seer sad news did bring To Ahab, e'en that wicked king! Hear what the word of mercy says, Spare thou the man, âbehold he prays.â III Our hopes Christ Jesus to elate, Has bid us be importunate, And with the bustling widow vie, That triumph'd over tyranny. IV 'Tis peace, 'tis dignity, 'tis ease, To bless the Lord upon our knees; The voice and attitude of fear, For God's own eye, for God's own ear. V Christ Jesus when the Twelve besought His aid, the PATER NOSTER taught; By giving glory we begin, And end in deprecating sin. VI Then give the glory yet again, For who wou'd be in grief or pain, Or brook anxiety and care, When the quick remedy is pray'r. HYMN XIX. PATIENCE. I By sin and Satan un-intic't, JOB, type of our Emmanuel Christ, With all the gems he had in store, None half so bright as Patience wore. II JOB, son of Issachar, at length Proves Patience is the child of Strength; Yet Jesus cou'd new pow'rs create, And e'en in weakness made her great. III Long-suff'ring God, whose goodness can Bear with, and bless provoking man; Let us like thee attempt our parts, And 'gainst false brethren arm our hearts. IV Teach us in sickness to adore Thine hand, and all our ills restore; Or let us meditate in death, On Theeâpoor man of NAZARETH. V Teach me in poverty to think Of him who drank on Cedron's brink; But had not mansion-house, nor bread, Or to repose him, or be fed. VI Teach me 'midst all the griefs below, This transient State, this world of woe, Submissive on my bended knee, To take my cross and follow Thee. HYMN XX. WATCHING. I At every tempter's first essay, Be sure to watch, be sure to pray; For this great requisite the Lord Has strongly urg'd upon record. II Yea this he strongly urg'd to all, A warning common as his call; Then who can his behest revere, And not obey in heed and fear. III Had the good man been on his guard, His doors and windows duly barr'd, He wou'd not, by the Lord advis'd, Have lost his all, and been surpriz'd. IV Had this command been fully weigh'd, Peter his Lord had not betray'd; But spite of all his mighty boast, He fail'd, and slept upon his post. V Sleep notâbut watch the chamber well, By sleeping Holofernes fell; And Jael's memorable nail, Did o'er a sleeping king prevail. VI âBehold, I comeââcome quickly then, Thou Saviour of the souls of men; For pray'r and hymns are mine employ, Who long for ever-wakeful joy. HYMN XXI. GENEROSITY. I That vast communicative mind, That form'd the world and human kind, And saw that all was right; Or was thyself, or came from Thee, Stupendous generosity, Above all lustre bright. II âNot Virgil. for themselves the bees prepare âTheir honey, and the fleecy care âNot for themselves are shorn: âNot for themselves the warblers build, âNot for themselves the lands are till'd, âBy them that tread the corn.â III The Lord shed on the Holy Rood, His infinitely gen'rous blood, Not for himself, but all; Yea e'en for them that pierc'd his side, In patient agony he dy'd, To remedy the fall. IV O highly rais'd above the ranks Of Angelsâhe cou'd e'en give thanks Self-rais'd, and self-renew'dâ Then who can praise, and love, and fear Enough?âsince he himself, 'tis clear, Is also gratitude. HYMN XXII. GRATITUDE. I I upon the first creation Clap'd my wings with loud applause, Cherub of the highest station, Praising, blessing, without pause. II I in Eden's bloomy bowers Was the heav'nly gard'ner's pride, Sweet of sweets, and flow'r of flowers With the scented tinctures dy'd. III Hear, ye little children, hear me, I am God's delightful voice; They who sweetly still revere me, Still shall make the wisest choice. IV Hear me not like Adam trembling, When I walk'd in Eden's grove; And the host of heav'n assembling, From the spot the traitor drove. V Hear me rather as the lover Of mankind, restor'd and free; By the word ye shall recover More than that ye lost by Me. VI I'm the PhÅnix of the singers That in upper Eden dwell; Hearing me Euphrates lingers, As my wond'rous tale I tell. VII 'Tis the story of the Graces, Mercies without end or sum; And the sketches and the traces Of ten thousand more to come. VIII List, my children, list within you, Dread not ye the tempter's rod; Christ our gratitude shall win you, Wean'd from earth, and led to God. HYMN XXIII. PEACE. I The Mount of Olives was thy seat, O Angel, heav'nly fair; And thou, sweet Peace, didst often meet Thy Prince and Saviour there. II But now abroad condemn'd to roam, From Salem lov'd and bless'd; A quiet conscience is thine home, In every faithful breast. III Thou didst Augustus first inspire, That bloody war should cease; And to Melchisedec retire, The Sov'reign of our peace. IV O come unto the Church repair, And her defects review; Of old thou plantedst olives there, Which to redundance grew. V Sustain the pillars of the state, Be health and wealth conjoin'd; And in each house thy turtles mate, To multiply mankind. HYMN XXIV. MELANCHOLY. I O pluck me quick the raven's quill, And I will set me down, My destin'd purpose to fulfil, But with this interrupted skill, Of thought and grief profound. II How to begin, and how depart, From this sad fav'rite theme, The man of sorrow in my heart, I at my own ideas start, As dread as Daniel's dream, III As soon as born the infant cries, For well his spirit knows, A little while, and then he dies, A little while, and down he lies, To take a stern repose. IV But man's own death is not th'event, For which most tears are due; Wife, children, to the grave are sent, Or friends, to make the heart repent That it such blessings knew. V O thou, which on the mountain's brow, By night didst pray alone; In the cold night didst pay thy vow, And in humiliation bow, To thrones and pow'rs thine own. VI Tell us, for thou the best can tell, What Melancholy means? A guise in them that wear it well, That goes to music to dispel Dark thoughts and gloomier scenes. VII Say, didst thou solitude desire, Or wert thou driv'n away, By rank desertion to retire, Without or bed, or food, or fire, For all thy foes to pray. VIII Yet thou didst preach of future bliss, Peace permanent above, Of truth and mercy's holy kiss, Those joys, which none that love thee miss, O give us grace to love. HYMN XXV. MIRTH. I If you are merry sing away, And touch the organs sweet; This is the Lord's triumphant day, Ye children in the gall'ries gay, Shout from each goodly seat. II It shall be May to-morrow's morn, A field then let us run, And deck us in the blooming thorn, Soon as the cock begins to warn, And long before the sun. III âI give the praise to Christ alone, My pinks already show; And my streak'd roses fully blown, The sweetness of the Lord make known, And to his glory grow. IV Ye little prattlers that repair For cowslips in the mead, Of those exulting colts beware, But blythe security is there, Where skipping lambkins feed. V With white and crimson laughs the sky, With birds the hedge-rows ring; To give the praise to God most High, And all the sulky fiends defy, Is a most joyful thing. HYMN XXVI. MUTUAL SUBJECTION. I Some think that in the Christian scheme Politeness has no part; That manners we shou'd disesteem, And look upon the heart. II The heart the Lord alone can read, Which left us this decree, That men alternate take the lead In sweet complacency. III When his Disciples great dispute Christ Jesus reconcil'd, He made their sharp contention mute, By shewing them a child. IV If I have got the greater share Of talentsâI shou'd bow To Christ, and take the greater care To serve and to allow. V This union with thy grace empow'r More influence to supply; Hereafter, he that lacks this hour, May be as great as I. HYMN XXVII. GOOD-NATURE to Animals. I The man of Mercy (says the Seer) Shews mercy to his beast; Learn not of churls to be severe, But house and feed at least. II Shall I melodious pris'ners take From out the linnet's nest, And not keep busy care awake, To cherish ev'ry guest. III What shall I whip in cruel wrath The steed that bears me safe; Or 'gainst the dog, who plights his troth, For faithful service chafe. IV In the deep waters throw thy bread, Which thou shalt find again, With God's good interest on thy head, And pleasure for thy pain. V Let thine industrious silk-worms reap Their wages to the full, Nor let neglected Dormice sleep To death within thy wool. VI Know when the frosty weather comes, 'Tis charity to deal To Wren and Redbreast all thy crumbs, The remnant of thy meal. VII Tho' these some spirits think but light, And deem indifferent things; Yet they are serious in the sight Of CHRIST, the King of Kings, HYMN XXVIII. SILENCE. I Before thy betters with suspense, Into thyself withdraw Silence denotes superior sense, And shews superior awe. II Keep blessing still within thy heart, In meditation meek; Thus thou'rt prepar'd to act thy part. When urg'd at length to speak. III When words break forth not duly weigh'd From out the babbler's tongue, Full many a mournful mischief's made, Full many a conscience stung. IV Then pray with David, that the Lord Wou'd keep himself the door; And all things from thy lips award, That make thy brother sore. V But if there be a point to praise Some godly deed of price, With all thy might thy plaudits raise, Here silence were a vice. HYMN XXIX. LONG-SUFFERING Of GOD. I One hundred feet from off the ground That noble Aloe blows; But mark ye by what skill profound His charming grandeur rose. II One hundred years of patient care The gard'ners did bestow, Toil and hereditary pray'r Made all this glorious shew. III Thus man goes on from year to year, And bears no fruit at all; But gracious God, still unsevere, Bids show'rs of blessings fall. IV The beams of mercy, dews of grace, Our Saviour still suppliesâ Ha! ha! the soul regains her place, And sweetens all the skies. HYMN XXX. HONOUR. I In Man it is the truth affirm'd, Mean craft and guile withstood, And variously by various term'd, Is both by grace and blood. II Courage and patriot zeal thou art, An ardour for the whole, At once munificence of heart, And magnitude of soul. III In women 'tis that jealous fear, Which tends to parry shame; It is their Chastity's barrier, And bulwark of their fame. IV It is sweet dignity and ease, Reserve without disdain; Pleasing, tho' negligent to please, Bearing, not giving pain, V Then kneel, ye little prattlers down, I'll bless, if you will pray, And one shall wear the laurel crown, And one be Queen of May. HYMN XXXI. IMMORTALITY. I âBe of good cheer, for I, ev'n I, âHave overcome the world;ââ The wind and tide are yoursâapply Your oars with sails unfurl'd. II Sure Immortality was known To few, but very few, Before I came, the corner-stone, To build my work anew. III But now ye know it in your hearts, Ye hear it with your ears; Not by dark vision, or by starts, Its evidence appears. IV Sheep, blessed sheep, ye shall be brought To pleasures how divine! To joys surpassing human thought, And such as equal mine. V How brilliant past conceit each star Shall shine before the Lamb: 'Tis bliss to know not what you are, By knowing what I AM. HYMN XXXII. Against DESPAIR. OLD RALPH in the WOOD. I A raven once an Acorn took From Bashan's tallest stoutest tree; He hid it by a limpid brook, And liv'd another oak to see. II Thus Melancholy buries Hope, Which Providence keeps still alive, And bids us with afflictions cope, And all anxiety survive. HYMN XXXIII. For SATURDAY. I Now's the time for mirth and play, Saturday's an holyday; Praise to heav'n unceasing yield, I've found a lark's nest in the field. II A lark's nest, then your play-mate begs You'd spare herself and speckled eggs; Soon she shall ascend and sing Your praises to th'eternal King. HYMN XXXIV. For SUNDAY. I Ariseâariseâthe Lord arose On this triumphant day: Your souls to piety dispose, Arise to bless and pray. II Ev'n rustics do adorn them now, Themselves in roses dress; And to the clergyman they bow, When he begins to bless. III Their best apparel now arrays The little girls and boys; And better than the preacher prays For heav'n's eternal joys. HYMN XXXV. At DRESSING in the MORNING. I Now I arise, impow'r'd by Thee, The glorious sun to face; O cloath me with humility, Adorn me with thy grace. II All evil of the day forefend, Prevent the Tempter's snare; Thine Angel on my steps attend, And give me fruit to pray'r. III O make me useful as I go My pilgrimage along; And sweetly sooth this vale of woe By charity and song. IV Let me from Christ obedience learn, To Christ obedience pay; Each parent duteous love return, And consecrate the day. HYMN XXXVI. At UNDRESSING in the EVENING. I These cloaths, of which I now divest Myself, ALL-SEEING EYE, Must be one day (that day be blest) Relinquish'd and laid by. II Thou cordial sleep, to death akin, I court thee on my knee; O let my exit, free from sin, Be little more than Thee. III But if much agonizing pain My dying hour await, The Lord be with me to sustain, To help and to abate. IV O let me meet Thee undeterr'd, By no foul stains defil'd! According to thy Holy Word, Receive me as a Child. Pray Remember the POOR. I I just came by the prison door, I gave a penny to the poor: Papa did this good act approve, And poor Mamma cry'd out for Love. II Whene'er the poor comes to my gate, Relief I will communicate; And tell my Sire his sons shall be As charitably great as he. Plenteous Redemption. I David has said and sung it sweet, That God with mercy is replete; And thus I'll say, and thus I'll sing, In rapture unto Christ my King. II King of my heart and my desires, Which all my gratitude inspires, Bids me be great and glorious still, And so I must, and so I will. The Conclusion of the Matter. I Fear Godâobey his just decrees, And do it hand, and heart, and knees; For after all our utmost care There's nought like penitence and prayer. II Then weigh the balance in your mind, Look forward, not one glance behind; Let no foul fiend retard your pace, Hosanna! Thou hast won the race.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX TO THE HYMNS for CHILDREN. (Not to the London Edition.) HYMN I. KNOWLEDGE of GOD. I Shine forth, eternal Source of Light, And make thy glories known; Fill my enlarg'd, adoring sight With lustre all thine own. II Vain are the charms, and faint the rays The brightest creatures boast; And all their grandeur and their praise Are in thy presence lost. III To know the Author of our frame Is our sublimest skill: True science is to read thy Name, True life t'obey thy will. IV For this I long, for this I pray, And following on, pursue, Till visions of eternal day Fix and complete the view. HYMN II. LOVE of GOD. I Great God of Love!âthat charming name Should all my powers controul; Should make my best affections flame And kindle all my soul. II Nor I, nor Angels round the throne Can love to what's thy due; Beauties divine to them unknown Pass all they have in view. III When they have stretch'd their wings for flight, The steep ascent to try; Struck with the vast and boundless height, In wonder lost they lie. IV Yet they for ever wonder on And gaze with high delight: And love the Infinite unknown, With all their mind and might. V I too would lift mine eyes to see What Angels can't explore, With fix'd attention gaze at Thee, And wonder and adore. VI O clear mine eyes, my heart inflame, With love fill up my soul; Let this affection reign supreme, And all my powers controul. HYMN III. FEAR of GOD. I Celestial King, our spirits lie Trembling beneath thy feet; And wish, and cast a longing eye To reach thy lofty seat. II In Thee, what endless wonders meet! What various glory shines! The crossing rays too fiercely beat Upon our fainting minds. III Destruction waits upon thy frown, And heav'n attends thy smile; A wreath of lightning arms thy crown, But love adorns it still. IV Angels are lost in sweet surprize, If thou unveil thy grace; And humble awe runs thro' the skies, When wrath arrays thy face. V Created powers, how weak they be, How short our praises fall! So much akin to nothing we, And Thou th'eternal all. VI Lord, here we bend our humble souls, And awfully adore! For the weak pinions of our minds Can stretch a thought no more. HYMN IV. TRUST in GOD. I Great Source of boundless Power and Grace, Attend my mournful cry; In the dark hour of deep distress, To Thee, to Thee I fly. II Thou art my strength, my life, my stay, Assist my feeble trust; Drive these distressing fears away, And raise me from the dust. III O, let me call thy Grace to mind, And trust thy glorious name; Jehovah pow'rful, wise and kind, For ever is the same. IV Thy presence, Lord, can cheer my heart, When earthly comforts die; Thy smile can bid my pains depart, And raise my pleasures high. V Here let me rest, in Thee depend, My God, my Hope, my All; Be Thou my everlasting friend, And I can never fall. HYMN V. COMMUNION with GOD. I Our heavenly Father calls, And Christ invites us near; With both our friendship shall be sweet, And our communion dear. II God pities all our griefs, He pardons every day; Almighty to protect my soul, And wise to guide my way. III How large his bounties are! What various stores of good Diffus'd thro' my Redeemer's hand, And purchas'd with his blood. IV Jesus, my living head, I bless thy faithful care; Mine advocate before the throne, And my forerunner there. V Here fix, my roving heart, Here wait my warmest love, Till the communion be complete In nobler scenes above. HYMN VI. CHRISTIAN LOVE. I Let men of high conceit and zeal, Their fervors and their faith proclaim; If Charity be wanting still, The rest is but a sounding name. II Patient and meek, she suffers long, And slowly her resentments rise; Soon she forgets the greatest wrong, And soon forgives her enemies. III She drives all malice from her breast, To ill suspicions ne'er gives way; But ever hopes and thinks the best, And as she thinks, is apt to say. IV She envies none their better state, But makes her neighbours bliss her own; Nor vaunts herself with mind elate, But still a modest air puts on. V Her neighbour's infamy and ill, To her no entertainment give; She's pleas'd to see him prosper still, And still in good repute to live. VI This is the Grace that reigns on high, And brightly will for ever burn: When Hope shall in enjoyment die, And Faith to intuition turn. HYMN VII. HUMILITY. I Folly builds high upon the Sand, But lowly let my Basis be; Firm as a Rock my Hope shall stand, Deep founded in Humility. II Content, when threat'ning Ills obtrude, Sweet meek-ey'd Patience, arm my Soul; And let a prudent Fortitude Teach me my passions to controul. III My God, I long to know Thee still, To love, and fear, and trust Thee more, To live submissive to thy Will, And whilst I feel thy Grace, adore. IV My Faith and Love, obedient be; Dear Saviour! teach me thy Commands; My ardent Soul still follows thee, And trusts her Int'rests in thy Hands. V Let Love and Mercy, all divine, Justice, descending from the Skies, Kindness and Truth, my Heart incline, Still to forgive mine Enemies. VI Thus may I act the Christian Part, The Social, Human and Divine, Whilst a wise Zeal inspires my Heart; Then shall I know that Heaven is mine. HYMN VIII. WISDOM. I Father of Lights, conduct my feet Thro' Life's dark, dang'rous road; And, O, let ev'ry step still bring Me nearer to my God. II Let Heaven-ey'd Prudence be my guide, And, when I go astray, Recall my feet, from folly's path, Into a better way. III Teach me thro' ev'ry various scene To keep my end in view, And whilst I tread life's mazy track Let wisdom be my clue. IV That Wisdom which is from above Abundantly impart; And let it guard, and guide, and warm, And penetrate my heart; V Till it shall lead me to thyself, Fountain of Bliss and Love: And all my darkness be dispers'd In endless light above. HYMN IX. OBEDIENCE. I Thee, dearest Lord, my soul adores, I would be only Thine; To Thee my heart and all its pow'rs I willingly resign. II Give me a calm and thankful heart, From ev'ry murmur free; The blessings of thy Grace impart, That I may live to Thee. III Whate'er thy sacred will ordains, O give me strength to bear; And let me know my Father reigns, And trust his tender care. IV Whate'er thy Providence denies I calmly would resign; For thou art just, and good, and wise, Lord, bend my will to Thine. V Be this the purpose of my soul, And my determin'd choice, To yield to thy supreme controul, And in thy will rejoice. VI O, may I never faint nor tire, Nor wander from thy ways; But (which is all my soul's desire) Help me to sing thy praise. HYMN X. FORGIVENESS of INJURIES. I And is the Gospel peace and love? Such let our conversation be; The serpent blended with the dove, Wisdom and meek simplicity. II Whene'er the angry passions rise, And tempt our thoughts and tongues to strife, To Jesus let us lift our eyes, Bright pattern of the Christian life! III O, how benevolent and kind! How mild, how ready to forgive! Be this the temper of our mind, And these the rules by which we live! IV Dispensing good where'er he came, His greatest foes still felt his love! O, if we love the Saviour's name, Let his divine example move! V Their malice rag'd without a cause, Yet, with his last expiring breath, He pray'd for murderers on the cross, And bless'd his enemies in death. VI Lord, shall thy bright example shine So long in vain before mine eyes! Give me a soul akin to thine, To bless and love mine enemies. HYMN XI. CONTENTMENT. I God's all my portion, all my good, From his rich mercy flows; And his good Providence secures The blessings he bestows. II I envy not the great man's state, Nor pine to see his store; With what I have I'm pleased much, With what I hope for more. III Then let me make the Lord my trust, And practise all that's good; So shall I dwell among the just, And he'll provide me food. IV I charge my thoughts, Be humble still, And all thy carriage mild, Content, my Father, with thy will, And quiet as a child. V The meek, at last, the earth possess, They are the Heirs of Heaven; True riches, with abundant peace, To humble souls are given. HYMN XII. ODE to the CREATOR. I The spacious Firmament on high, With all the blue Ã¦thereal Sky, And spangled Heav'ns, a shining Frame, Their great Original proclaim. II Th'unweary'd Sun from Day to Day Does his Creator's Pow'r display, And publishes, to ev'ry Land, The Work of an Almighty Hand. III Soon as the Ev'ning Shades prevail, The Moon takes up the wond'rous Tale, And nightly to the list'ning Earth Repeats the Story of her Birth. IV While all the Stars that round her burn, And all the Planets in their Turn, Confirm the Tidings as they roll, And spread the Truth from Pole to Pole. V What, though in solemn Silence, all Move round the dark terrestrial Ball! What though, nor real Voice nor Sound Amid their radiant Orbs be found! VI In Reason's ear they all rejoice, And utter forth a glorious Voice, For ever singing, as they shine, The Hand that made us is divine. HYMN XIII. For CHRISTMAS-DAY. I High let us swell our tuneful Notes And join th'angelic Throng, For Angels no such Love have known, T'awake a chearful song. T'awake, &amp;c. II Good-will to sinful Men is shewn, And Peace on Earth is giv'n, For lo! th'incarnate Saviour comes With Messages from Heav'n. With, &amp;c. III Justice and Grace, with sweet Accord, His rising Beams adorn; Let Heav'n and Earth in Concert join, Now such a Child is born. Now such, &amp;c. IV Glory to God in highest Strains, In highest Worlds be paid; His Glory by our Lips proclaim'd, And by our Lives display'd. And by, &amp;c. V When shall we reach those blissful Realms Where Christ exalted reigns; And learn of the Celestial Choir, Their own immortal Strains. Their, &amp;c. HYMN XIV. For GOOD-FRIDAY. I Awake, my Soul! this solemn Day, To Notes deep, melting, soft, and slow, Sing in some Heart-affecting Lay, The Man of God, yet Man of Woe. II Speak first his Sorrow and Dismay, When thrice in Agony he pray'd The bitter Cup might pass away, But pray'd in vain celestial Aid. III Then paint the Scourge and thorny Crown, The wanton Marks of foul Disgrace: His precious Blood fast trickling down His radiant, more than Angel Face. IV And last, the cursed Tree, recall, Whereon thy Lord, thy God, was tied: Till pale and faint, disown'd by all, He bow'd his sacred Head and died. V But who can sing this piercing Scene? They, only they who sing above; Ye Seraphs then inspire some Strain Worthy to laud such wond'rous Love. HYMN XV. For EASTER-SUNDAY. I Jesus Christ is risen to day, Hallelujah. Our triumphant Holy-Day; Who did once upon the Cross, Suffer to redeem our Loss. II Hymns of Praise then let us sing, Unto Christ our heav'nly King; Who endur'd the Cross and Grave, Sinners to redeem and save. III But the Pains which he endur'd, Our Salvation hath procur'd; Now above the Sky He's King, Where the Angels ever sing. Hallelujah. HYMN XVI. For WHIT-SUNDAY. I Creator Spirit, by whose Aid The World's Foundations first were laid, Come, visit ev'ry pious Mind, Come, pour thy Joys on Human Kind. II From Sin and Sorrow set us free, And make thy Temples worthy thee: Illumine our dull darken'd Sight, Thou Source of uncreated Light. III Make us eternal Truths receive, And practice all that we believe; Give us thyself that we may see, The Father and the Son by thee. IV Immortal Honours, endless Fame, Attend th'Almighty Father's Name; The Saviour Son be glorify'd, Who for lost Man's Redemption dy'd. V And equal Adoration be, Creator, Spirit, paid to thee: âCome, visit ev'ry pious Mind; âCome, pour thy Joys on Human Kind! The LORD's PRAYER. Accept, most gracious God, our grateful Lays, And let the Muse proclaim thy boundless praise. Soon may thy Kingdom come;âSoon may we see Time swallow'd up in vast Eternity! Soon may our Souls to the third Heav'ns arise, And view their Maker with immortal Eyes! Thy Will be done!âIn thee we put our trust; For what thou will'st is ever right and just: In all thy brute Creation here below, Whilst they yet live their daily food bestow. But unto us, who boast a nobler Race, Add to thy Gift of Bread, thy Gift of Grace. Forgive our Sins, and thy Compassion show To those, who on the Poor their alms bestow. Let not th'infernal Foe our Souls ensnare; Nor let our Trials prove too strong to bear: For thine's the Glory:âThine's the Might, the Pow'r: And thou'rt the only God whom we adore. The End.</field>
