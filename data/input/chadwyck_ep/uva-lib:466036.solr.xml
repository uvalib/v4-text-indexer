      <field name="fulltext">I DEDICATE THESE COUNTRY AIRS TO THOSE FRIENDS OF MINE Alfred Hayes and Richard Le Gallienne AS AN ATTEMPTED PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP EQUAL TO THEIR OWN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A COTSWOLD VILLAGE Roses! Great wild roses, Aisles of bud and whitethroat song All along The lower lanes Where Peace, That first inhabitant of earth, Remains: Folding her hands as day begins And closes She, tranquil, watches May That melts to June in roses, Great wild roses, Roses! These are so fair that they should rest My rivals on the snowdrop breast Where God, by some sweet circle of event, Has lent me refuge when I turn From street and stool And work by rule, Scarred by the plea of endless discontent, The wine of morning sunshine stale or spent. We neither spoke. The leafy lyrics of the stripling oak Sang us along. Hamlet by hamlet passed, And yellow sheep, We came at last Upon the hills that keep, As mothers watch their babes asleep, Long Compton guarded in the vale: There as a dreaming child it lay And took the evening light; It was the vocal end of day And larks in giddy flight So out of view made music ring That clouds, not birds, Appeared to sing. Go home, go home, ye doves, from out the field! Fly to your forest cradles, fly! In ambuscades of greenery concealed Ponder the day gone by. The shepherd is gone home, The last rooks come, Dear Jenny Wren shall whistle nothing more; His team well-housed and fed The ploughman thinks of bed, And smiles upon his sweetheart at the door. Down Gipsy Lane we roam, Go home, ye doves, go home! Little of sunlight now This fruitful valley holds, Deeper the greys invade, Fainter become the golds; The youngling's tap is on the pane, And maids with sewing mothers sigh; Go home, go home, ye doves, from out the field, To forest cradles fly! We walked toward the inn. O host and hostess looking forth To make the welcome warm, What man may fare from south to north, From palace or from farm, Shall early learn your kindly hearts And never come to harm! O happy days! O days of country beauty made more sweet By steppings of dear feet And voices captured from the city's stress To add a charm to all the loveliness Of leaf and land! The lesser whitethroat in the orchard growth Beneath an apple planned A hive for nest, And as we lay and watched The while she matched Each grassy joist and beam, The fluffy architect, unstirred, Rounded the entrance with her beak Or smoothed the cup Where she would dream Upon her family of eggs, And warm them into song Where pears and pippins throng. Early we rose and raced to catch Initial glories of the morn; The air itself was an embrace, And Beauty, living in the place, Seemed growing personal and kind, Till in my heart, Till on my face I felt the thrill That comes when lips I love consent, Obedient to my will. So hour by hour and day by day Long Compton nursed our idleness, Each meadow-path, each woodland way Where campion calls and bluebells press Conferred its bounty of delight; And when the fields of heaven were bright With stars that have a native fire, And those that do conspire To rob a sun, We knew a lane Where in a briar's heart a bird Released a strain To cheer the mother musing on her eggs, And promise her a son Whose tender tale Should shake the sleeping rosebud into dreams And be the wonder of this Cotswold vale. When time is weary of my company Here let me rest. If I should end within four walls With bricks around, Buy me no smoky patch of city ground, But bring me to these acres of repose Whose natural consecration is most sure, That I may sleep beneath a country rose And where the dew is pure; For in this valley God appeared to me, And where my soul is let my body be. What time the Father walked His earth He trod, I know, these Cotswold slopes; With silence and with sound He clothed each mound; The shadow of His robe goes over them, The bounties of His wisdom cover them And whoso cometh here To tread this sodâ He sees the neighbour neighbourly, And learning all Long Compton's loveliness The better learns his God. PARTING Why, love, don't weep! Our joy was long, Sweet twenty years Of smile and song. I shall but wait Asleep, asleep, For you to comeâ Why, love, don't weep! Why, love, don't weep! The end is this; There comes a bound To speech and kiss: For joy like ours The price is cheapâ Sweet twenty years! Why, love, don't weep! AN ORCHARD DANCE All work is over at the farm And men and maids are ripe for glee; Love slips among them sly and warm Or calls them to the chestnut-tree. As Colin looks askance at Jane He draws his hand across his mouth; She understands the rustic pain, And something of the tender south About her milkmaid beauty flits. Her dress of lilac print for guide Draws shepherd Colin where she sits, Who, faring to her lovely side To snatch his evening pension tries, But skimming like a bird from clutch The maid escapes his Cupid touch, And speeding down a passage flies Not fast enough to cheat his eyes. Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days, And sweetheart captures of the waist, How swiftly still the virgin runs She's sure at last to be embraced! Now Colin fires at kiss delayed, And faster flits the red stone floor Till Fortune yields the tricky maid A captive at the pantry door! The farmer with his fifty years Is not too old to join the fun; He pulls the milkmaids' pinky ears And bids a likely stripling run To find the fiddlers for a dance: And in the cherry orchard there A tune shall mingle with romance, And love be brave in open air. The village wakens to the bliss, The crones and gaffers crawl to see The country game of step and kiss Beneath the laden cherry-tree. The chairs and benches now are set, Old John is wheedled from his pet, The cider cup with beady eyes Responds to winkings of the skies. The farmer, burly in his chair, Now claps for ev'ry fond and fair To foot it on the grassy patch While rustic violinists snatch From out those varnished birds of wood A tune to jink it in the blood. Now Jane and Colin in a trice Float sweetly round not less than thrice Before their motion draws a pair To revel with the dancing air. The thrush, that on his velvet wipes His juicy bill, protesting pipes, And, somewhat as a piccolo, Doth race the concord of the bow. A virgin yonder by the tree Rejects a mate who saucily Would press, if she might only start, Her modest homespun to his heart. Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days, And sweetheart captures of the waist, Though like a finch the maiden flies She's sure at last to be embraced. The orchard now is in full bloom With rosy cheek and snowdrop throat; The stars invade the growing gloom, And rarelier sounds the blackbird's note. But in this dewy little park Love burns the brighter for the dark, And till he use a stricter rule Dear Cicely's cheek shall never cool! The fiddlers storm a tomboy tune, The shepherds closer clasp the girls While skirts the more desert the shoon, And rebel leap the lovely curls. The farmer glows within his chair And muses on the dancing time When he and Sheâa matchless pairâ Were warm and nimble in their prime. God bless the man who, duller grown, Can feel the younger heaven anew By granting to his maids and men A romp by starlight in the dew! Ah, greenwood ways and greenwood days, And soft pursuings of the waist, The cheek must yellow out of praise, And bent be those who once embraced! And now they pant against the trees, And, using darkness for their plan, Girls loose the garters at their knees And mend the clumsiness of man. One virgin, thankful for the dance, About the music shyly tripsâ Her Love's a fiddler, and her love Pops fruit in Paganini's lips; Or finding on the starlit tree The wife and husband cherry there, She hangs the couple at his cheek And hides the stalk with tufts of hair. The girls are at the cider-cup, And shepherds tilt the yellow base Until a giddy amber flood Runs, kissing, over Cicely's face, And Dora's upper lip doth shine With winking beads of apple-wine. The fiddlers scrape a farewell tune, The dancers dwindle in the dusk While summer puffs of easy wind Bring hints of cottage garden musk. And thus the revel dearly ends With milkmaid's palm in shepherd's hand, And lovers grow from only friends Where plum and pear and apple stand. Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days, And sweetheart captures of the waist, How fast so-e'er the virgin flies She's sure at last to be embraced! DELIA Delia, that will not kiss, Is hardly ripe To glow again at airs Of shepherd-pipe. Sing of the flock to-day, And wait for Love To storm the simple breast, And stir the dove. Touch but her tender waist And she shall cry! But Love may come before Her tears are dry. Then, shepherd, tune to trees Your wanton pipe; Delia, that will not kiss, Is hardly ripe. BABY Come, Mother, bring the baby out, And let her rollâthe grass is dry! Take off her shoes, and she shall kick Those pinky toes toward the sky. The firmament forgive her crime! And as a sign of love and grace May God, who holds it, send my child Her mother's hair, her mother's face! See, Mary, here's a cherry-tree To make her eyes grow round and bright; Oh, how she chatters to the fruitâ The dimpled bundle of delight! There, sweetheart! See the gaudy cheek, And see the naughty lurking stone; And now each juicy half (my word!) Is Baby Rosebud's very own! Dear Mother, as I watch this child Stare upward to the depthless blue, My spirit, fleeter than the gaze, Goes up with thanks for her and you. God, blight my orchard, scourge my friend, And drive my blackbird from his tree, But leave this babe for Mary's breast, And let me tend them both for Thee! CONVALESCENCE Three weeks her face was snowy white From memory of her pain, But then, with dear, recapturing light A gradual glow again Taught almost tintless buds to show Their mimicry of pink; They were but ghosts of former glow, But yet a lovely link Between the opulence of health, The poverty of care, When she but grew my greater wealth, And fathomlessly fair. At last the happy edict gave A boundary to alarms, And lifting her, myself the slave, Heaven trembled in my arms! Now wife and babe before my fire In speechless converse rest; The milky comfort, his desire, And hers, the bounteous breast. One arm is free, and strong with joy Around me warmly slips When that I stoop to bless the boy, And touch him with my lips. THE NIGHTINGALE Whereas the blackbird and the thrush Are fondly English in their song, And finely pipe great island airs Where bloomy orchards throng, The nightingale has all the East Within his dear tumultuous breast; World-passions and the strong refrains That ring in wild unrest. Circassian music he can sing, Rough mountain loves, and stories meek That in the vineyard valley run From traitor cheek to cheek. And all the secrets of desire, By right of lyric ancestry, From out a midnight hawthorn bush He now reveals to me. AT MIDNIGHT Now that the living sleep And the dead awake, Joy shall return to me And my cold hands take. Here at the midnight hour I shall feel again Love in a kiss, and then The resulting pain. But when the dawn shall speed With its stealth and flash, Deep in my heart the fire Shall again be ash. A PASTORAL [Who would shepherd pipes forsake] Who would shepherd pipes forsake If there greet him dearly Cupid in the knee-deep brake Singing sweet and clearly? Who to London deserts go, Scanning friendless faces, If there beat a heart for him Under Laura's laces? As I near the leafy oak, Laura, swift as starling, Brings her cheek for me to strokeâ Little fragrant darling! Take your air in Rotten Row, Gentlemen of leisure, Milkmaid kiss and velvet sloe Fashion me my pleasure! While we sit the stilly skies Change from blue to purple, And my arm in daring lies Round a homespun circle! Thus doth pastoral delight Follow shepherd-duty, Speeding to my heart at night Laura's love and beauty! HAPPY LIFE Baby beauty on my knee, Baby's mother near me; Master Bullfinch grown so tame That he cannot fear me; Brooks to tell of dipping maids, Ruby cloves to scent meâ What a happy, happy life God in trust has lent me! Baby tumbles on our bed, Either cheek a cherry, Raiding Laura's lovely heart, Mischievous and merry! Infant swallows at my eaves Twitter, and content meâ What a happy, happy life God in trust has lent me! INSPIRATION I lay my head on the foolscap page, Bidden to sing, and being mute; No help there came with the lovely air Of the blackbird's magic flute. My Love ran in, and she kissed my cheek. Lyrics woke in my blood and rang; Her hair glowed gold by the foolscap page, And the barren singer sang. TO DORA God's mercy, Dora, what's a kiss That you should whimper like a child? A maid was ne'er as coy as this, A woodlark never was so wild. There went, i' faith, no niggard pinch You little pecking sweetbill finch! Come, loveliness, 'tis but the task Of mating Cupid's red to red; A rosebud touch is all I ask, Lift up, dear nun, this shining head! There! see how good a thing it isâ God's mercy, Dora, what's a kiss? CLARINDA'S BEAUTY The tree may win the stripling With its clusters round and red, And a shepherdess may languish Till his silly mouth is fed; But Clarinda has an orchard Where sweet circles grow for me, And no shepherd, though he covet, Dares approach my cherry-tree! The mistress airs her velvet Ev'ry Sunday down the aisle As the sunburnt farmers titter, And the saucy milkmaids smile; Though it cost a mort of money And can make the children stare, 'Tis a thistle to the softness That Clarinda's cheek doth wear. But when my sweetheart dangles In the Avon as it goes Her feet, and cattle ponder On the marvel of her hose, Not a virgin ever trusted Such a comely white as this To the chilly river fingers, And for water-lips to kiss! REGRET O human bird, whose nest has been Within my heart a thousand days, To fly away so suddenly When April glittered in her green, And woodland aisles For leafy miles In fifty fine harmonious ways Were musical with flying praise, Was a strange winging from my life, O false and fairâ Was a departure that the sense Could nowhere gather strength to bear! Day comes. The Artist of the dawn Makes all the sky a masterpiece; The dewdrops vanish from the lawn And from the shepherd's sheep. Each day's a miracle to cheat the mind, Night brings the wonder, sleep; But all along the lane there flies My loss of her whose helping eyes Made olden moments kind; And in the pulsing heart of night, When darkness seems to throb to light, Remembrance of my whitethroat yet Comes with a great regret. No blackbird's magic in the bush, Succeeded by the aching hush, Can win me from my thought of her; And all that Father Avon says To leagues of blue forget-me-nots Cannot cast out My dream of Jenny's girlish ways, Her lovely pout; And all those perished days When on my knees She sat contented till the sun was setâ God has not fashioned me to think them nought, Or taught me to forget! A CONTRAST The apple in my garden Is a round of bloom and scent, With the grass beneath it pointing To the blue above it bent: Here's dew of dawn, and music That can shame a city's rush; For Town the hurdy-gurdy, But for Warwickshire the thrush! At middle day the blossom Takes the utmost of the sun; The tits as sweet explorers All along the branches run: 'Tis wild-birds' country piping That can make the forehead flush; For Town the hurdy-gurdy, But for Warwickshire the thrush! As Mary milks the cattle, And I stoop to kiss her cheek, The lilac shakes with lyrics From the song-bird's easy beak: 'Twas God who made him poetâ How his masterpieces gush! For Town the hurdy-gurdy, But for Warwickshire the thrush! A SONG [All night I have lain in the Gipsies' camp] All night I have lain in the Gipsies' camp, Heel to heel with a gipsy lass, With a planet hung in the sky for lamp, And for bed the honest grass: At morn I have wended upon my way, Taking only as baggage thisâ The love that lies in a gipsy's eyes And a gipsy maiden's kiss. All day I have pined for the greensward girl, Brown and sweet in the forest hush, Where a man may play with a southland curl, And a southland virgin's blush: I'd give my wealth if there warmed me again, Filling eve with a daring bliss, The heart that pressed at a gipsy's vest, And a wildwood gipsy's kiss. CICELY BATHING The brook told the dove And the dove told me That Cicely's bathing at the pool With other virgins three. The brook told the dove And the dove told me That Cicely floating on the wave Woke music in the tree. The brook told the dove And the dove told me That Cicely's drying in the sun, A snowy sight to see. HESTER SINCLAIR Hester Sinclair passed me by, Busy at her gloveâ Hester Sinclair whom I call Lavender and love! Little waves of muslin film Lapping at her feet, Hester trips, all snow in snow, Country fair and sweet. Hester Sinclair homes to meâ Mine this woodland dove! Hester trembles in my arms Lavender and love! BETTER SO Friend, you did well to die! How agonising was that hour When the last inch of candle grew A heated pool; when at the pane The morning wind, a bully, blew, While you, no whit discomfited By all these great Spring gusts at play, In all the sorcery of senselessness Did hardly stay To breathe away The fragments of your span, Last lingerings of the man So soon to fashion us supreme distress. In the acacia on the lawn The storm-cock whistled vengeance and disdain; The milder thrush, in harmony with fate, Piped cheerly through the active flight of rain Ineffably sedate. Below him in the lilac-tree The blackbird in his cottage green Did sing between The plainings and content. O God, I thought, bring back again His pleasure in the firmament; Instruct his ears to catch Some redstart's whisper, some reviving snatch Of chaffinch music, ere, the morning spent, These servants of the dawn, These breathing songs, Desert the lawn! His ears, O Lord, were reverent, And Thou dost know He loved Thy miracles With all his force, Praising Thee daily more because Thy love Mellowed the woodland with the soothing dove, Set linnets in the gorse, Made sweet the darkness with the nightingale That we might find his comfort in the vale Though seeing not its source. Give him to hear again our words, To hear the birds; To drink the landscape's distances With those deep eyes In ecstasies At finding spread around him everywhere The everlasting sameness and surprise. Friend, you did well to die! The incarnation of ideals Is slow; The health of nations mendeth not; They go From base to base Immeasurably fraudulent In gross and cunning government. But you did burn to see A Brotherhood arise That in nobility should not misfit The Maker of our skies; But day by day more separate we stand, Pursuing pelf, Adoring self, One blood, one fate, but not one Band. Due to the spade and promised to the earth We buy our guinea's worth of evening mirth, Go home and ponder how the money spent Shall be extorted from the negligent, Improvident Poor brother, who, with equal worth, By all the devilry of biting need Comes as a test of our prevailing creed To beg, for Christ's sake, aid! We, dressing for the tomb and promised to the spade, Make profit of his hurt In golden dirt! How this would wrench your heart if you were nigh, You who with me Could bear to see Espousals of the brick and of the gladeâ The serpent street crawl greedy to the wood, The mason drive the pigeon from her bough, The hind, dismayed, From following his plough, If all this robbery from Nature meant A crop of fresh content; If all these rendings of her verdant robe, Invasions of her temples gave Serener glory to the globe, A thrilling to the slave! Brother, they drive the field-mouse hence, They steal the finches' home; From mead to mead, from fence to fence, With all the power of impotence The merchant-princes come, Sending the workmen first to clear the way, To build and slay. In half a hundred dingles where of yore We lay on moss, and spake of Evermore While blackbirds shrilled the present in our ears, Are cots and babes and tears! With moss and melody and woodlands dense Fled Innocence, As She will fly from centres of repose, Northward and southward, east and west, Within her bosom thrusting as She goes Her honeysuckle and her pink wild-rose. How this would wrench your heart if you were nigh! Friend, it was wellâthat bitter vanishingâ Friend, you did well to die! DORA'S RIBBON Plague upon the ribbon And the bow beneath my chin! Bells no longer call me, And the service should begin. Kate will walk with Colin, Mary go with Johnâ Drat the band of cherry silk That won't go on! Plague upon the ribbon! I must fix it with a pin! Yet the bow looks pretty As it cuddles at my chin! Richard's in the garden Looking at my paneâ Sunday next the cherry band May sulk again! COMFORT How poorly reaches to my heart, When all my joy is in eclipse, The stilted comfort and the noise Of kind, but useless, lips. But down the road an arrow's flight Where evening brings the sleepy birds, The thinnest twitter in the green Is more than clumsy words. And in that forest synagogue, Whose aisles are paved with bloom and sod, A broken heart may haply find The tenderness of God. TO A GLOW-WORM In thee there lives the energy Can make the turf a heaven, May birds that peck thy candle die By Parson Rook unshriven! Thou art a child the Father's hand Within this fruity acre Dropt in the grass, as shy and still As any virgin Quaker! Thou tiny, unofficial lamp Within my orchard burning, Dost signal by this living star Thy husband home returning? Here at this cherry's grassy base Thou'rt sure of no upbraiding; Too small thy lantern to arouse The thrush for midnight raiding. As tender girls at water-play Grow blanched when shepherds whistle, So fades thy spark if carelessly I brush this neighbour thistle. Ah, how my freckled lads would run, A knee apiece would capture, And prattle questions if they watched Thy lovely light in rapture! A SONG [It was the time when heaven comes down] It was the time when heaven comes down And paves the wood with blue; A firmament of hyacinths Drank deep of forest dew: The cooing of a lonely dove Went mourning on the breeze, And over all there swayed the songs And sighings of the breeze. The velvet palms of moss caressed And comforted my face; An angel joy from Paradise Seemed truant in the place: The forest was a voice, and sang, O Love long dead, of you What time the gracious heaven came down And paved the wood with blue. AT EVENING Below her in the valley farm She heard the rustic mirth; The pastures lessened to a line Was heaven as much as earth. The fiddle poured a dancing tune, That called her feet. And oh! Her heart was hungry for the lad She danced with long ago! OLD LETTERS Last night some yellow letters fell From out a scrip I found by chance; Among them was the silent ghost, The spirit of my first romance: And in a faint blue envelope A withered rose long lost to dew Bore witness to the dashing days When love was large and wits were few. Yet standing there all worn and grey The teardrops quivered in my eyes To think of Youth's unshaken front, The forehead lifted to the skies; How rough a hill my eager feet Flung backward when upon its crest I saw the flutter of the lace The wind awoke on Helen's breast! How thornless were the roses then When fresh young eyes and lips were kind When Cupid in our porches proved How true the tale that Love is blind! But Red-and-White and Poverty Would only mate while shone the May; Then came a Bag of Golden Crowns And jingled Red-and-White away. Grown old and niggard of romance I wince not much at aught askew, And often ask my favourite cat What else had Red-and-White to do? And here's the bud that rose and sank, A crimson island on her breastâ Why should I burn it? Once again Hide, rose, and dream. God send me rest. MORNING The throstle and the dawn Together come That light and music may Invade my home; And wakefulness begins In Laura's hands; Upon her pillow stir Those glowing strands That lure me till I kiss Her dreamy eyes To win her back from sleep To Paradise. A LULLABY Sleep, dearest, sleep. The birds are still, The trees are hushed Upon the hill. Oh, in green dreamland valleys deep Rest, dearest, restâsleep, dearest, sleep. Rest, Alice, rest, And wait for me. If Gods be kind I come to thee! Oh, in thine eyes the dawn is deep, Rest, Alice, restâsleep, Alice, sleep. TO MY LOVE (With a rose) That freedom thou dost now control Once basely commerced with my soul; All inward enterprise, unchid, In fancy grew as Fancy bid; But now, possessed by thee, it grows So clean a captive as this rose. A DEFENCE (Written on being charged with undue frankness) Dear country Muse, my heart's delight, Whose purity displays The rounded nude of loveliness For shepherd-pipes to praiseâ Dear Muse, that dancing on the green Inspired my country tone, Have I who saw your chastity In seeing lost my own? Have I, for all your liberal love And wildflower music, taught A multitude your bosom's white Uncovered, but unsoughtâ And not this lesson from your snow, This knowledge from your kneeâ That more of virtue, less of robe, Belongs to purity? With glimpses of a sunny neck, And ripe untrespassed lips That boasted even brighter red Than any autumn hips, Barefooted, in a rebel robe That kissed your careless knee And showed the splendour of your shape With woodland modesty, You danced adown a forest-aisle And taught me from the store Of simple airs your lyric lips Shall sing for evermore. In what array your beauty cameâ I sang it as I might; So sings the pupil blackbird, so The poet of the night; The thrush, a student of your dance, Divinely serenades Your revelation of the limbs That twinkle in the glades. Should I within your leafy school The only scholar sit To pipe discordantly, and be Less trusted than the tit? Not so, sweet country Muse! The wood Demands the scanty gown; Why should their London velvets clog Your dances on the down? I have not shamed you, O my love, So friendly and so wild! You shall not blush to teach again Your lover and your child! Who call me base must think me base; But soon afresh for me Your speeding footsteps in the grass Shall prove my purity!</field>
