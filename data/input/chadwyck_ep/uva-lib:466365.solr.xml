      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE FIRST 1872. EARLY POEMS. ?To sit alone And think for comfort how, that very night, Affianced lovers, leaning face to face, With sweet half listenings for each other's breath, Are reading haply from a page of ours, To pause with a thrill (as if their cheeks had touch'd) When such a stanza, level to their mood, Seems floating their own thought out—“So I feel For thee—and I for thee.”? Elizabeth Barrett Browning. TO HIM. I dedicate these few poor lines to Him,— Love of my Life! Dearest of my desires!— The one who kindled in my breast those fires Which neither time nor tide can dull or dim. Some written in the dew of earlier tears Than longings for his love have caused to flow, And others written in the sunny glow Of years which he has bless'd,—thrice happy years! I give Him not alone the thoughts I frame, With them, the erring heart from which they sprung, And all the dearest accents that my tongue Can kiss into the music of His name! Oh, could I write out on a golden scroll The essence of my being! I would then Leave but my hollow shell for other men, And give Him, with my Life and Love,—my Soul! WRITTEN ON SAND. I wrote upon the shining sands The name that I loved the best, Ere I saw the sun, in a glow of light, Sink down in the distant West. Then the wild sea-breeze blew loud and shrill, Yet I linger'd by the shore, Till the waves crept over the written word, And I saw that name no more. And tho' it was only a written word, Yet I would that it had stay'd, For I learnt a lesson true and sad, As I watch'd those letters fade; And I wonder'd if there were a land,— A far-off heav'nly place,— Where the letters traced on the heart's warm sand, Time's waves would not efface! “OH, SING THAT SONG YOU SANG BEFORE!” Oh, sing that song you sang before When Life seem'd bright and fair! Before the mem'ries and the tears Of alter'd times and after years Had risen bleak and bare; And like a wall, between our hearts Had shut out Hope and Truth, And tinged the brightest years of Life With darker thoughts, and keener strife, Than well became our youth! Oh, sing that song you sang before, And as its notes shall ring I'll close my eyes and dream once more That I am as I was of yore When last I heard you sing! “SPEAK OF THE PAST.” Speak of the Past, for ever flown, It is not often that we may; Thy words seem like stray blossoms blown From those dead flow'rs of yesterday, Or like the feathers from the wings Of angels that have pass'd away! To dream on what was but a dream, To wait and watch, in vain, in vain! To long in darkness for a beam Of that past hope which now is slain; To look and long, to watch and pray, For that which cannot be again; This is the madness of my soul, Thy love can never reach as far, There are two halves in every whole, But these, in Love, unequal are; And when I know how great is mine, I feel, perforce, how small is thine! “FOR EVER AND FOR EVER!” I think of all thou art to me, I dream of what thou canst not be; My life is curst with thoughts of thee For ever and for ever! My heart is full of grief and woe, I see thy face where'er I go; I would, alas! it were not so For ever and for ever! Perchance if we had never met, I had been spared this mad regret, This endless striving to forget, For ever and for ever! Perchance if thou wert far away, Did I not see thee day by day, I might again be blithe and gay, For ever and for ever! Ah, no! I could not bear the pain Of never seeing thee again! I cling to thee with might and main, For ever and for ever! Ah, leave me not! I love but thee! Blessing or curse, which e'er thou be, Oh, be as thou hast been to me, For ever and for ever! THE SECRET. The words I dare not tell to thee, To Earth and Sky, to flow'r and tree, I softly breathe: the Summer's shine Has warm'd those whisper'd words of mine, The Winter's snow, the Autumn's blast, Have guess'd my secret as they pass'd; The sparkling waves of tideless seas Have learnt it of the murmuring breeze; Yet all unchanged,—no Summer glow E'er thaw'd thy breast, oh, Winter Snow! At those warm words! Oh, sunny sea! Thou art as thou were wont to be! Thy fickle wavelets kiss the shore, Then lose themselves for evermore. The blast unheeding, hurries by, No meteor flashes through the sky, As, leaning from my casement's height, I tell my Secret to the Night. Oh, if, like Nature, all unmoved, Thou, too, couldst learn how thou wert loved, If what thy heart may long have guess'd Raised no emotion in thy breast But that felt by the wanton child Who breaks the toy on which it smiled; If, having gain'd it, this poor prize Should seem the poorer in thine eyes, And grow more worthless worn and won,— Then am I right to breathe to none Save Earth and Sea, and Sky above me, The words, “I love thee, oh, I love thee!” A THOUGHT. At night, as lying half awake I muse upon my soul's desire, Out of the embers of the fire There seems to glide a glitt'ring snake. Sucking my life, with poisonous hate That serpent coils till morning's rise, And whispers, “On his bosom lies A dearer form—a warmer weight.” Oh, if from coiling near my heart That viper would become my friend! If its soft gliding tongue would end This aching wound from which I smart; Then I would call it by some name, Love or Despair (which would be best?)— And pressing it unto my breast Would fondle it, and make it tame! BURNING LETTERS. Burn, burn, oh, burning letters! Alas! and as ye fade away, So shall the love that once inspired you, So shall the heart that once desired you, Before the breath of Time decay! Oh, words that have been warm'd with kisses! Oh, words that have been wet with tears! Oh, words that have been bless'd and cherish'd! What will remain, when ye have perish'd, To light me in the coming years? How shall I know my darling loved me, Oh, by what sign, since kisses die? Since lips grow silent, and cold faces Learn to forget the burning traces Of love which has been long put by? Oh, dear blue eyes that I have lived for! You look'd upon this written line! Oh, hands that traced these tender phrases, Oh, lips that once could sing my praises, How fondly you have clung to mine! How can I burn what he has written, What I so long have hidden here? How can I banish thus completely All these dear words, which sound so sweetly, All these sweet names, which are so dear? Yet oh, 'tis better they should burn now, Whilst his warm heart still beats for me, Than that, upon some dark to-morrow, I should gaze on them, in my sorrow, And say, “These words are warm—not he!” For though I would for ever cherish Each word that he could write or say, I would not that these letters only Should be the sad memorials lonely Of something that had pass'd away; I would not read the words I loved so, Knowing their meaning gone and dead, A bitter mockery of pleasure, The echo of a joyful measure After the melody had fled! Then, whilst I still can hope he loves me, Then, whilst his love may last, I pray, As warm, as passionate, as this is, Go! wet with tears, go! warm with kisses, Into the flames, and fade away! HIS NAME. Oh, for some new-coin'd name by which to call him! Oh, for some name no other lips can give! “Love” has been said by those who loved so coldly, “Life” has been said by those who could not live! “Darling,” the sweetest name without a meaning,— “Soul,” often said to many a soulless thing,— “Dearest,” to that which is not always dearest, “Treasure,” to what is not worth treasuring! Oh, I would have his new-found name mean “Beauty,” And I would have his new-found name mean “Love,” And I would have it also mean “For ever,” While there is Earth beneath and Heav'n above! And I would have it also mean “a Blessing,” And I would have it also mean “a Shrine,” And I would have it also mean “a Longing,” And it must also mean that he is mine! And I would have it also mean “my Idol,” And I would have it also mean “my breath,” Life of the very life I live and breathe from, Soul, that will even warm my very death! Where shall I find this magic name to give him? How shall I learn to spell this hidden word? Oh, shall I find it cradled on the zephyr? Or lurking in the wood-notes of the bird? Or, far away, where yonder pink horizon Lures on the night with many a golden streak, There, whisper'd in the clear-toned notes of Angels, Oh, some day, shall I find the name I seek? THE COQUETTE. I listen'd, scarcely knowing that I listen'd, It nestled in my unsuspecting breast; I mark'd its plumage fair, its eyes that glisten'd, And smooth'd with careless hand its golden crest; I call'd it now a curse, and now a blessing,— I fondled it, I tortured and caress'd, Till, wearied of my teasing and caressing, It flew away, and yet I never guess'd! . . . It flew away, and as I watch'd it flying, And saw its pinions fluttering above, I stretch'd my arms towards it, wildly crying “Return! and be again my captive dove!” But from its gentle voice came no replying, In vain to lure it back to me I strove, And all the voices of my heart are sighing, “Ah, it was Love!” “I LIVE MY LIFE AWAY FROM THEE!” As the sad sighing of the wind that blows Outside the windows that we firmly close Against its breath, or as the distant sea Murmurs afar, and is not always heard But only when no louder sound is stirr'd, So, under all, through all, my being flows This song, “I live my life away from thee!” What matter, if the years bring good or ill? What can they hope, who ever hope on still Against all Hope? And after Hope is dead? Oh, lost, lost, Love! Oh, bitterer than this Love I have known,—Love I have loved to kiss Yet cannot hold! Love, I have loved my fill Yet thirst for now! What shall I love instead? Oh, Love! oh, Life! will it be always so, Through my whole life, and wheresoe'er I go? Oh, how so fair the sights that I may see, What will they profit me? Thou art not here, And ever, ever, ringing in mine ear I seem to hear, in accents sad and low, The words, “I live my life away from thee!” What takes his place that is worth harbouring, Love the Immortal! Love, the only King Time, the great leveller, can ne'er dethrone? What may we clasp, whose arms have closed on him Who can rule soul, and breath, and life, and limb? What other leader is worth following? Who can know other loves, him having known? Oh, in the sea of such a dear delight Let me be buried deep and out of sight! Drown'd in the waters of that sweet warm sea, Clinging to lips that living, I may lose, Dying the happy death that I would choose Were it e'en given us to die aright! But ah! “I die my death away from thee!” Because most seeming loves are calm and cold, Bought for a song, and all as lightly sold, Let not the ones who know Love as he is Fling him away! Of all that has been given, Love is the gift that brings us nearer Heaven Than any other gift the world can hold, And perfect Love is nearest perfect bliss. Then let me lose myself in his sweet ways, Or let me die, before these golden days Die, or the pleasure of them dies in me! Oh, sweet were death, if only, half in death, I could but silence that sad, sighing breath, That even then, I fear me, would upraise The wail, “I live and die away from thee!” NEW YEAR'S DAY. 1871. As, in a month, alternate days Are bright with sun, or dark with storm, As some are chill, and some are warm With southern winds, and sunny rays— So, in men's lives, the changing years Bring mirth or sorrow, joy or pain, Some heralded with merry strain, Some with a passing-bell, and tears; But as those years, that now are gone With drooping heads, and folded wings, Into the dusk of bygone things, Resembled not this new-fled one— So, to the hearts that now are sad, May come new hopes of joy and peace, So, to the gay, fears lest they cease Those joys that made the past year glad! To thee and me, the uncoin'd hour May bring a world of change unguess'd (Save to that love, which in my breast Blooms like some fair immortal flow'r). For thee I wish each coming day May bring upon its bosom fair Some hidden blessing, and that care At its light step may haste away! And as for me, no greater bliss I ask of Time, than that he may Bring thy heart nearer mine each day, And my lips nearer to thy kiss! Or, if, to both, the coming years Are bound in equal share to bring New pleasures, and new sorrowing, Take thou the smiles, leave me the tears! MY KING. Of this poor heart you ask me who is King, Since to your eyes so many seem to reign; Alas! the kingdom is so small a thing That, like the unaccepted throne of Spain, 1870. Methought my little crown had gone unclaim'd, Or scorn'd maybe, if I had ever named, Who was the King. Both old and young pretenders oft have strove To plant their alien banners and be King; And all the hot artillery of love With mad acclaim, has echo'd, thundering Its perilous appeal through all my heart, But of that stronghold, or its meanest part, They were not King. Yet on that hidden throne a King is set, A tyrant, a more arbitrary king Than erst was Tudor or Plantagenet, And to this rebel kingdom did he bring Such dear destruction, such sweet sophistry, That if it could it would not now be free From such a King. At first it would not own his tender sway, And feared to call the dear usurper King, But all its trusted bulwarks broke away, Where they had seem'd the strongest, and the ring Of “Victory!” resounded through the air Before the vanquish'd knew the foe was there,— And he was King! Oh! trebly crown'd as with a papal crown! Of heart, and soul, and all my senses, King! Giver of all the bliss my life has known! Sharer of all worth my remembering! Creator of so many thoughts and schemes, Of this, my bond slave heart, and all its dreams You are the King! IN YEARS TO COME. The years to come may sweep away What now we prize, and turn to grey This curly dark brown hair, The years may dim these ardent eyes And turn to tender memories These moments that seem fair. Yet, if they leave me still your kiss, All else they steal I shall not miss, And folded in your arms The voice I love will sound as sweet As now, whilst kneeling at my feet You praise my youthful charms! Our eyes may be too tired to read, But book or pen we shall not need, Since, echoing in each breast, Will linger still the tender truth, The history that in our youth We used to love the best! Then bless these moments ere they fade (For, Curly Head, this song is made For you and only you!) And whilst your heart is young and light, And whilst your hair is brown and bright, And whilst your eyes are blue, Lay up a store for future hours Of fleeting love's departing flow'rs Which I will treasure too! SO LATE! My happiness has come to me so late; Had it come earlier, I had almost fear'd That long ere this the thunderclouds had near'd, Bearing some fatal bolt to compensate. For, like those Indians, who, when joy is near, Bow to the earth, and fear to be too glad, Lest their offended god should make them sad, So I, too bless'd by you, seem half to fear. But since my bliss has come to me so late, I hope the while I fear, postponing yet My dread anticipation of the debt, That Love has made me feel I owe to Fate. LOVE IN WINTER. The ground is white with driven snow, “How cold!” say they who do not know For warmth and shelter where to go— (I know! I know!) Cling to me! Love me! Kiss me, so! . . . And warmed by Love's delicious glow, Forget that there is Death or snow! “HE WILL NOT COME!” He will not come! The dire deserted street Is black and silent, save when, now and then, The passing feet, alas, of other men, Deceive my aching heart and make it beat,— He will not come! Ah, who is it that makes him break his tryst, And almost her poor heart who waits him now, Pressing against the window-pane the brow And longing lips he has so often kissed? . . . He will not come! He will not come! . . . and somewhere, far away, His ears may hear the echo of my moan, His eyes may see me watching here alone, His heart may guess my anguish as I say “He will not come!” “He will not come!” the words are like a knell, I drop the curtain that with hopeful hand, I drew aside, yet linger where I stand, All loth to bid his memory farewell, He will not come! He will not come! ah, absent one, good night! Good night, sad street, good night, dear shelt'ring tree; Good night! good night! to all that breathes of thee; One more last look—good night to love and light! He will not come! ON A GLOOMY DAY. The year is past, and you and I No longer tread life's path together, And clouds are gathering in the sky, That seem'd so bright in ev'ry weather! For, folded to my darling's breast, I could not turn aside to know If winds were blowing east or west, Or clouds were dealing rain or snow! I did not think of north or south, I heeded not the angry skies, But breathed my zephyrs from his mouth, And saw my summer in his eyes! Oh, near the heart that seem'd so warm, I did not feel this chilling blast, And I have smiled at rain and storm, And mock'd the tempest as it past! But now, alas! I am alone, And I can see the drifting rain, And I have time to hear the moan Of tempests that are here again. Ah, you who plant my life with flow'rs, And make all skies to seem so blue, Come back to me and light the hours That darken at the loss of you! Ah, could we end this weary strife, And soul to soul, and heart to heart, Be each the sunshine of the life, That fate now bids us live apart, Then might the ceaseless torrents pour, And lightnings follow ev'ry kiss, I should not fear the thunder's roar, Or dread a day as dark as this! MY RECORDS. The words that are spoken are soon forgotten, Music is played, and then dies in the air; But all these my children—my soul-begotten, Will live to me longer than tune or pray'r. The lines that are written, and sealed, and treasured, May breathe of too much, or may seem too cold, Whilst these that are written, and rhymed, and measured, Can tell far more tenderly what they have told. Ah, and far more plainly than old tunes playing, And far more distinctly than pictured scroll, These words that the voice of my heart is saying Will bring my love of you back to my soul! In days that fear neither loving nor losing, In days that are dawning or may not dawn, The breath of my songs will keep from closing The darkening curtains that Time has drawn. And from ev'ry page, like a faded blossom, Whose colours are dimm'd, but whose fragrance clings, These written words that once lived in my bosom, Will tell their old home of departed things; Till out of the Past, as I gaze in sorrow On records of love that was loved in vain, The dream of my youth, in that dim to-morrow, Will seem to come back to my arms again! LONDON. I like to think that when your love has waned London will still stand on, and be to me The noisy echo of your silent voice! I like to think of all the streets and squares Where once your shadow fell, or did not fall When I have watch'd for it! Ah, woods and fields, And forest-glades, will tell me much of you, But Nature changes more than these dim walls Into the which your memory seems built To gild them, like a sunbeam, till they fall; And far away from all those sylvan scenes I cannot hear your laughter in the brook, Or trace your pathway in the broken fern, Whilst here a hundred dark and stone-paved ways Re-echo to my heart the step of Love! I like it to be thus, and often think “Ah, here, or there, my heart will always beat A little faster, e'en in after years; Here is a spot my eyes will never see Without in fancy seeing what they loved Above all else!” Ah, desolate to me Will then seem all these many-peopled streets As those of ancient cities, hid away For thousand years beneath the lava-flood, And brought to light when all their life has fled! I hardly dare to think upon such days Whilst yet the glamour of a rising sun Makes all this mist seem mingled pink and gold; But now and then a shiv'ring passing form, And all the loveless looks of other men, These tell me that, to many heavy hearts, London is now a city of the dead, Peopled with wanderers amongst the tombs! To such as these I have not time to turn, (My life is such a hey-day of delight!) But, going to and fro, at morn and eve Betwixt my happiness and my regret, I meet these pallid forms and pass them by, Yet after, conscience-like, they haunt my dreams, And all the impotence of woman's life, With all its small desires, and vain resolves, And loves (maybe as vain!) like a reproach These haunt me too! Oh, London, many-voiced! Great city, where my love has lived and breathed, Live on, and reign the dusky Queen of Towns! Had this hand strength, thine unabolish'd wrongs Had been redress'd, and all thy fever-fogs Dispersed, as with a fairy's magic wand! Live on, dear city! for my darling's sake, Live on, when this poor voice is mute to bless The heedless witness of my youth and love! And bright as all thy streets seem now to me Would they could be to all thy chequer'd world! “TOUT VIENT À QUI SAIT ATTENDRE.” All hoped-for things will come to you Who have the strength to watch and wait,— Our longings spur the steeds of Fate,— This has been said by one who knew. She loved you when your heart was cold, Her eyes said “yes” when yours said “nay,” You love,—her heart is turn'd away And beats no longer as of old! He sang to her at early dawn, She turn'd away and would not hear; She seeks him now, he is not near; She craves his love—his love is gone! She pray'd for yours—you long for hers; Hers lived last year, yours lives to-day; His lived, but now has pass'd away,— And when she calls no answer stirs! How make it well for him—for her? How clip the pinions of her heart To give to his the longer start? For whom the rein?—to whom the spur? Ah, darling! could we run this race (This race of loving), side by side, I should gain knowledge how to ride To keep our hearts at equal pace! But ah! betwixt us sea and plain Are stretch'd afar in dreary line, And if your longing equals mine, Or if your loving wax or wane, I know not, for I cannot see, So far from mine your pathway lies, In vain I strain my weary eyes, Your life is lived away from me! Ah! rare, indeed, if heart to heart, If soul to soul can cling and turn, If love for love can breathe and burn When each is torn so far apart! Ah, “All things come to those who wait” (I say these words to make me glad), But something answers soft and sad— “They come, but often come too late!” “AFTER LONG YEARS.” As I stand upon the pathway where I saw you standing last, I look vainly for your footprints, for so many more have pass'd; They have press'd upon those dear ones, and have trodden them away, And these others, that came after, will be trodden out as they. Then I think “Life is a pathway, and the footprints are the years, Where our sorrows mock our laughter, and our smiles efface our tears, As with living, so with loving, changing figures come and go, Sweeping out each other's footmarks with their flittings to and fro.” Ah, my darling, then I wonder if at sunset, when you gaze O'er the country you have travell'd, with its sad and pleasant ways, Will you mark where fell my footsteps on your pathway for a space, 'Ere the coming feet of others shall have swept away their trace? Can I think it? dare I hope it? when together hand in hand, For a little while we journey'd,—when our shadows on the sand Seem'd as one for but one moment, and alas! then two again, Dare I hope that any record of my passing will remain? Or, when in your mem'ry's mirror, all your vanish'd loves shall pass, Will my shadow linger longer than the others in the glass? With a look half sad, half mocking,—half in smiles and half in tears, Will my lips waft something to you like the kiss of bygone years? When I vanish, who will follow? Will you loose or hold her fast? Will she linger as I linger'd? Will she pass as others pass'd? In the dim uncertain future, who shall come you may not guess, She may sweep me from your mem'ry with the trailing of her dress; You may loose me in her beauty, and forget me in her smile, And her breath may fade the picture that you cherish'd for a while. Hast'ning past those days of sunshine, when our lives seem'd merged in one, From the sunshine you may hurry to the presence of the sun, For it may be that the moments were but wasted loving me, Or only the foreshadowing of happier ones to be! But ah! if they love more fondly (future love or future wife), If my living was not loving—if my loving was not Life, Oh, then drive my trembling spirit from the threshold of your heart, Let me hear you taunt and mock me as I shudder and depart! Let me see the eyes I worshipp'd on another shed their beams, And then let me fade forgotten to the chilly land of dreams! Ah, I fain would drop the curtain on my wand'ring thoughts that range, For here nothing can be certain but the certainty of change; Dare we promise, or un-promise, to remember or forget, Knowing all the changeling changes that the Future may beget? But the Present is our own still, and I hug and hold it fast, As the sailor in a tempest fastens wildly to the mast; For I know not, if I loose it, what my future fate may be; Are the waters sweet or bitter of that dim unfathom'd sea? Till our “Never” is “For ever,” till “To-morrow” is “To-day,” Till all Future things are Present, till our Present fades away; Dare we plan or dare we promise? All the voices of my mind Seem to say, “Beware and tremble, lest to-morrow be not kind; Lest your Heaven be not Heaven—lest your Idol should depart;” But “I love you, oh! I love you!” say the voices of my heart. Oh, forsake me, and forget me, oh, be cruel and unkind; I forget it—I forgive it! round your life my love is twined; You have made my world a Heaven, you have fill'd my soul with bliss, And the thirst of all my being is forgotten in your kiss! Ah, my darling, on the pathway of the life that I have trod, Deeply printed are your footsteps, like the footsteps of a god; Treading out all fainter traces—seal'd for ever in the sand, Marking which were pleasant places in that unforgotten land! And your shadow, not as others, will it fade away and pass? I shall stretch my arms towards it when I see it in the glass; I shall cling to it and kiss it,—I shall whisper to it, “Stay!” For your memory shall be my love, when love has pass'd away! Oh, then love me for a little, for I live but for your smile! Betwixt coming loves and going, let me linger for a while! If you leave me can I blame you? Shall I hunger for you less? No forsaking makes forgetting! In my haunted loneliness I shall bow before the Power that reclaims what has been given, And live upon his memory who made the earth seem Heaven! COMPENSATION. To those who may have fail'd to gain The treasure that I prize to-day, Lest they should envy me, I say How long I strove for it in vain; How dark and dreary were the years, Lest they should deem my life all bliss, Before at last I won the kiss That dried the fountain of my tears. How months and weeks and days pass'd by, And how the lonely loveless night Seem'd but to come to show that light Had faded from the sullen sky. How sleep seem'd sent me to forget, And how my dreaming was a dread, How daylight dawn'd and darkness fled As sadly as the daylight set. And how a dull and weary ache, The thought that nothing good could be, Came like a death-chill over me When first I saw the morning break. And then there came the dismal round Of all the fruitless barren hours Scatter'd like handfuls of fresh flow'rs That wither wasted on the ground. Alas! the Winter's dreary gloom, The aimless yearnings of the Spring! The Autumn's silent withering, And all the blinding summer bloom! Long years of hopelessness, and how Unsunn'd, unnourish'd save by tears, My heart beat on thro' all the years That, thanks to you, are brighten'd now! Yet, lest to those whose lives have been Less sad, and now may seem less bright, My life should hold too much delight, Too much of what they have not seen; And lest they envy me the glow Of sunshine that my sun has shed Upon a path they may not tread, I say, “It was not always so;” That they may know these golden years Which Love has made to seem so bright, Were heralded by darkest night, And earned in bitterness and tears. BEFORE AND AFTER. Before I knew my soul's delight How often have I watch'd alone The garden glades, that blooming bright, In all their summer glory shone;— The fern that feather'd fresh and green, The tall ox-daisies in the grass, The fragrant smelling eglantine, And only sigh'd, “Alas, alas, Oh, wasted hours! oh, wasted days! My heart is sadden'd as I gaze!” Even the shadow of a bird Upon the daisy-spangled lawn Each secret pulse within me stirr'd;— The dewy freshness of the dawn Seem'd profitless and good for naught, And when the soft, warm day had waned, Its beauty grieved me, for I thought “To-day is lost, and what is gain'd! Oh, wasted hours! oh, wasted days! My heart is sadden'd as I gaze!” Oh, days that fled I know not how! So slow, and yet withal so fleet! The bud seem'd scarcely on the bough, Scarcely the rose's breast was sweet, Before the leaves grew crisp and sere, And all the earth was damp and chill, Whilst Autumn winds seem'd ev'rywhere To make the same sad murmur still— “Oh, wasted hours! oh, wasted days! My heart is sadden'd as I gaze!” Each thing of beauty seem'd to me A mockery,—a vain deceit,— The promise of some joy to be Which never would be mine to meet;— Or else the echo of a strain Of some such music as mine ears Had long'd and listen'd for in vain Thro' all the waiting, weary years,— “Oh, wasted years! oh, wasted days! My heart is sadden'd as I gaze!” Yet when, at Christmas-tide, the bells Rang mournful joy-proclaiming chimes, They sounded like the fun'ral knells Of what were almost happy times; And as I thought “Another year, Another wasted year has flown!” A thousand mocking voices near Echo'd from city spires the moan— “Oh, wasted years! oh, wasted days! My heart is sadden'd as I gaze!” But even as I mused and dream'd The old life faded quite away, And all the golden sunlight stream'd And warm'd my being with its ray. Ah, then for me, the garden glow'd, Ah, then for me, a silv'ry voice Sang in the river as it flow'd, And whisper'd to my heart, “Rejoice! The days of Death are gone and past, And Life and Love are here at last!” Ah, sailing now on sunny seas With such a new and dear delight, My heart grows light again, and these (The days of darkness and of night) Seem far behind our golden sails, Fill'd with the breath of Love's sweet voice, Whilst over sea-bound hills and dales I hear the echo'd words, “Rejoice! The days of Death are gone and past, And Life and Love are here at last!” Oh, when you read the words I sing (Should those sweet eyes but glance them o'er), Your heart will guess what hidden spring Inspired my simple metaphor, And you will know who spread the sail, Who made the world so bright to glow, And ah, in pity, do not fail, Dear Love, to try and keep it so! Then will the days of Death be past, And Life and Love be ours at last! NOW. Toys, tears, and kisses—then a few more tears— This is the burden of the changing years,— And after,—should our journey reach as far,— The land where neither toys nor kisses are, And further still, the loveless, listless years, Too cold for kissing and too tired for tears, (Ah, spare me these!) and then, a dawning Day Or closing Night? Alas, we cannot say! My toys are broken now, and all put by— My Queen of dolls is now a Queen no more,— Or lost, or litter'd on the dusty floor In some forsaken lumber-room they lie. My toys are gone, but still I have my tears,— These linger with us for a longer while— Yet whilst I weep, I know that I can smile— I smile and weep, maybe, some few short years; I have reach'd kissing; here my steps are slow, So pleasant seems the pathway with its flow'rs— A few more kisses for a few more hours, And then I reach a land I do not know. For I have only travell'd yet as far As where the roses and the kisses cling, And I can only dream of these, and sing Of such as these, well knowing what they are! Anon my heart may warm to colder things, But now I mark with half-unconscious eye The current of events that rushes by, Upraising Empires and dethroning kings. Oh, linger long, ye glad unfetter'd hours! How far the sun-glow spreads I cannot say, I feel it warm within my heart to-day, I see the pathway blinded with its flow'rs! Then let me sing the glories of these days, Let those who follow me, or go before, Tell of the country they are passing o'er, I know not now the pleasure of their ways! Oh, sweet green garden in this life of man! Oh, Youth! Oh, Love! Ah, hasten not away; Ye pass before my voice can murmur “Stay!” A star, set in the lifetime of a span! Yes, almost ere this ink of mine is dry, Whilst yet this scroll seems warmer from my hand, The restless atoms of appointed sand Have trembled through the hour-glass, and we die! These written words, these thoughts of Life and Death, These few sad rhymes I write to Love and you,— These all,—what are they? and my loving too? A little incense, rising like a breath! Yet take it! Ah, and if in after years This page, then long forgotten, meets your eye, Think once on her, before you lay it by, Who gave you all her kisses and her tears! 1876 THE SHRINE OF THE THREE KINGS. I. Beneath a grey cathedral's dome, Which ev'ning mirrors in the Rhine, Within a richly jewell'd shrine, The bones of these three kings of old At last have found an honour'd home. King Barbarossa gave the gold, And noble ladies of the land, For love of Christ, when Faith was young, Their rows of costly pearls unstrung, And gave them with a lavish hand To glorify the shrine, and mix With onyx and with sardonyx, And graven gems and rubies red, With scroll-work all enamellèd, And one great topaz at the head Seeming almost a mimic sun In size and lustre. Thus begun, This costly shrine with ev'ry year Grew bright with offerings, for here, Laid side by side on their pillow of gold, Repose the bones of those kings of old, The three wise men who saw the star, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar. II. It seems a mockery to me That you should sleep on thus, you three, Pillow'd upon one pillow; for Tho' all of you at once adored Before the manger of Our Lord The Prince of Peace, it may have been That fires of discord crept between In the after-years, to part you three. Some simple cause, maybe, of strife, Plunder of grain, or raid of herd, Or love of one or other's wife The breath of discord may have stirr'd, Kindling dissension and heart-burning Between you three at a later day, Of which we have neither legend nor word, For that you went back by a different way, To baffle the malice of Herod the king, Is all we are told in the good old Book;— Yet you may have waged intestine wars, And may bear on your bones the bloodless scars Cleft by the hand of the king your brother, When, wildly glaring at one another, Your dark eyes fierce with a murderous look, To the wolfish gnashing of those white teeth, How may have flash'd from without its sheath The jewel-hilted scimitar, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar! III. And then to lie on thus together, Thro' years of dark and sunny weather, In this, your narrow golden bed! So narrow, that each poor old head, Eyeless, and polish'd by Time, and brown, Crown'd each with its circlet of diamond crown, Almost touches the head of his brother king— As tho' they were each one whispering Some secret of State in the fleshless ear! Their secrets would be strange to hear, If ever those tongueless mouths find tongue, And after the midnight mass is sung, And after the midnight bell is rung From the grey cathedral's growing spires, They speak like their patriarchal sires, Maybe in the language of old Judea! Speak they as comrades, destined to share A couch of state enrich'd with care By King and Kaiser of after-time, By knight and pilgrim and lady fair? Or as foemen bound in the self-same cell, Under the clang of a Christian bell, 'Midst an alien race, in a colder clime? Was there peace betwixt you, or was there war, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar? IV. Ah, all these years, ye silent dead, How many prayers around you said Had seem'd to you of purport strange, Could ye have heard them! Change on change, As stone upon stone has upraised this spire, So change upon change, and desire on desire, Ambition, and rapine, and hunger and blood, The gold of the vile and the tears of the good, Have built up this fabric which men call “Faith,” With its flicker of life 'midst an odour of death, As here, in this gilded chamber, are spread These jewels and gold o'er the bones of the dead! Do you mourn, you three, as you hear the knell Of our hopes in heaven, our fears of hell, And long for the days when faith was strong, When daylight was measured by shrift and fast, And matins and vespers and evensong? Do you mourn for the days ere our faith had past— For the palmer with wallet and cockle-shell, And sandal shoon, and oaken staff? Or then did you mock to yourselves, and laugh At the twisted errors and crookèd saws, And the Mother Church, with her ravenous jaws Fang'd and open and eager for blood, Like some monster that preys on her own tame brood, Or an idol with victims under its car, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar? V. Yet, if it chanced that ye did smile At stolèd priest in fretted aisle, At the sacred feast of the Eucharist, Or at Christians marring the words of Christ, To dupe the poor and to flatter the great, And to keep the power in the hands of the priest, Bethink you, in all this fraud and guile, You three, lying here in your bed of state, Rich with the treasures of early art, Have taken your place, and have play'd your part! You were bribed with the jasper and amethyst, And the carven gems of the days gone by— The gifts of the noble and chivalresque, Wrought over in emblem and arabesque— With the bended knees of the lady fair, And the grey-beard pilgrim with fast and prayer; 'Twas this faith that seems now so feeble and old That encircled your hollow brown brows with gold, And that made you this shrine for your mouldering bones, Wherein you might rest and act a lie, Bright with the glimmer of precious stones, And that carried you hither from lands afar, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar! VI. “To act a lie!” for who are ye? Ye three impostors! Answer me! What do ye here in a Christian shrine, Dragg'd from the city of Constantine To deepen the letter of Scripture's truth? Who and what were you? In your youth What were your pastimes and who were your loves? Did you camp among spicy Arabian groves, Or dwell under the gilded minarets Of the glittering city of Ispahan? Were you Jew, or Affghan, or Turkoman, Dealers in amber and amulets, Or seed of the loins of anointed kings? Ah, who would not smile if it were to be found That you three skeletons, shrined and crown'd With your shining chaplets of diamond rings, Were only some poor old pagan bones, Brought hither to preach in solemn tones The grand old legend you did not know! To be worshipp'd by Christian lips and knees In this sacred fane, till the overthrow Of man or the Church! . . . With such thoughts as these Do I gaze on you now; but the sacristan Seeks for the mediæval key To lock you up in your narrow home (The consecrated golden shrine Beneath that grey cathedral's dome, Which ev'ning mirrors in the Rhine), So, handing to the worthy man His anxiously expected fee, I leave you, wondering who you are, Caspar, Melchior, and Baltasar! Cologne, August 16, 1875. A LAWLESS CREED. (IRIS TO THE WHITE CHIEF. From “The Idolaters” (unpublished).) “I desire no future that will break the ties of the past.” George Eliot. If there is anything that will not die When this, the “I” you knew, has pass'd away— This slave of sun and shade, this helpless thing,— Yet dreaming of some vague immortal germ— If the dim fancy that my soul may live Is but a dear delusion, nursed by Time And made by habit more familiar still, Yet not more possible; if never more Myself, (the half of you), my form, my face, My tender love of you, may live again, Nor take some semblance of the shape they wore— Then may my foolish yearnings go for naught, And all my emmet castles in the air Fall to the dust of vain imaginings! Yet, if the voice that whispers to my heart, “Something in thee there is that will not die,” Be not the echo of a self-made creed, And if some essence lives when I am gone, Dispersed, or whirl'd away by storms of air, Or lurking in the misty river-spray, Or hiding in the chalice of the rose— Then will I join myself again to you, And breathe upon your brow and fan your cheek, And I will cling to you in spray and mist, Or you shall see some flower and think of me— Your very thought, absorbing half my being, Shall breathe my spirit home again to yours, And I will mingle with you as of old— This is the only Immortality For which I hunger; and when you, my life, Have pass'd away into some other phase, Then can we cling together in the storm, And mingle in the light of summer days,— This is the lawless creed of one who loves; Yet could I deem it all a fond deceit, Then would I say, “Give me the ‘poppied sleep,’ And let my spirit fade away and die!” THE KISS. (FROM THE SAME.) I watch'd you sleeping, lying in your arms, And drank in, with mine eyes, in that half-light The dim and shadowy profile turn'd aside: Whilst breathing with you, 'twas as tho' I shared Half of your life, and gave you all of mine. I was so close—so close, so wholly yours,— Yet suddenly I, waking, seem'd to feel So separated from you by your sleep, So jealous of the people of your dreams, That o'er me stealing (tho' so near—so near!) A sense of desolation, with a kiss I call'd you back again to life and me. Darling, forgive me for that coward kiss— I trust too little, loving all too much, To bear the thought of losing what I love. Would I could see again that half-turn'd face, And lie once more in those enfolding arms— Would I could feel but jealous of a dream, And kiss away all rivals on those lips THE PLAIN WOMAN. “I was not born to crown of golden hair, Or wealth of deeper brown with russet tips, Nor was the fashion of my body fair, Nor did the hue of roses rich and rare Hang on my lips,— “Which parted not upon an even row Of orient pearls, with dimple at the side, Seeming to say, ‘Come, kiss me!’ in the glow Of conscious blush; nor was I arch'd of brow, Or starry-eyed. “I painted some who were as fair as this, For God had given me the power to limn Both men and women; neither did I miss The grace of colder Nature—lights that kiss The ocean's rim, “Or deep black shadows under forest trees! And I could gather wealth of flowers and fruit, And lay them down on canvas at my ease, And I had power to subjugate and seize Both bird and brute. “I read of women who were fair, and wept To know the world so deafen'd to my song Because of this rough lyre, wherefrom had leapt A grateful music, could one hand have swept The cords among! “Or, sometimes sleeping, did I falsely seem As fair as were the fairest; then indeed I wept at waking, for athwart my dream Had flash'd a fairy prince 'neath evening's beam, On prancing steed. “He was a prince so like that king of men Who pass'd me on the road, and let me lie At youth's lone midway milestone; it was then I cursed these faulty lines of Nature's pen, And pray'd to die. “A little more of lavish light and shade, A little less of that or more of this— Here tints that glow, or there the hues that fade; Such subtle nothings as these few had made Me good to kiss! “A careless slip by careless Nature made— A faulty measurement, a loaded brush Or empty palette; I, who make a trade Of seeking out the haunts of light and shade Would almost blush “To paint so poor a face! Yet from within (Unlike the faulty failures on these walls, The rough first sketches I did but begin, Then flung aside), above this mundane din, A voice there calls, “Which says to me, ‘Thou art not wholly base Since thou canst work and suffer.’ Ah, my soul! Thou hadst been fair hadst thou but been a face, Since thou canst bear the burden of this race Without a goal! “Nature hath warn'd me that I may not share The pastimes of a brighter heritage; Peacocks and daws peck not the same parterre, Nor sigh yon homely wives of Chanticleer For gilded cage, “Wherein may sing some captive, on whose breast Lingers, in mockery, the sunset glow Flash'd through the green savannahs of the west, Whereof he sings in sadness. It were best That each should know “All may not match in plumage with the hues Of tropic birds upon their varied wing; Each hath her sep'rate mission and her use, And those endow'd with song-notes cannot choose, But pipe and sing. “For me to weep: yet with how rich a dow'r Of woman's highest gift, serene and pure As is the folded chalice of a flower, My soul had met his love! With wondrous power Giv'n to endure. “‘Endure!’ Too cruel word! too cruel fate! Seal'd from the dear emotions of the blest; A thing too meaningless—beneath the rate Whereat we measure common love and hate, And doom'd to rest “(I, who had gloried in a treasure-trove!) Nursing a barren mem'ry all my life, Proving the love he did not e'en disprove. Ah! will the lissom lady of his love, His promised wife, “Bring him the treasure of so good a thing? . . . I know not; for bright insects oft deceive, Flitting upon the zephyr, murmuring, And seeming all so fair of form and wing That none believe “They bear a sting; and women who are fair Are often counted false—so many seek To win their favours—flatter'd ev'rywhere— Till love and change seem in the very air They breathe and speak. “I hope for him, yet fear. . . . Oh! if a day Should dawn when he may know this aching pain, This thirsting after waters turn'd astray, This longing for those blossoms blown away To bloom again, “Then may he think of one whom long ago He pass'd in silence by!” . . . She turn'd aside, And down her cheek in blighted sadness flow The tears that none compassion; whilst her brow, (Not “starry-eyed,”) Seem'd clouded o'er with mists of sullen thought; Then, turning to her work, she lightly drew An armèd knight, his breast-plate all enwrought With steel and gold; her cunning pencil caught His eyes of blue And backward-blowing plume. This picture lay With many a change of posture and half-light, About her chamber: she would e'en portray The careless look with which he rode away Out of her sight. Thus ended her sad song; and all unmoved The careless swallows twitter'd as she grieved: The fairy prince was gone. It is unproved If by the lissom lady that he loved He was deceived; Perchance, the course of true love runs not smooth— And we are told such things have often been: Yet this I somehow learnt—a bitter truth— At that lone midway milestone of her youth He had not seen That hapless lady of the faulty face; Nor, if his life had sorrows, did he deem Those sorrows sprung of any want of grace In her or him, in any earthly place Or in a dream. He rode away, nor look'd to left or right, Nor guess'd his passing made the sole romance Of that poor loveless life, nor knew the night Ensuing on the evanescent light Of his one glance! Should he have linger'd, and with eagle eye Discern'd the pearl hid in so rude a shell? Alas! if woman's love were deep and high And sweet as is the spice of Araby, This had been well! Or if it were a thing as passing rare As is the mystic death-note of the swan, Then women who are plain, or others fair, Would seem but varied blossoms, sweet to wear And gaze upon. But woman's love is oft a lighter thing Than is the gold dust on the butterfly, Brush'd with too eager pressure from the wing, And losing by too careful treasuring Both light and dye. And thus it is, maybe, that on Life's road Men will not tarry to unearth the gem Lurking behind the eyelids of the toad, When such a heaven of starry lights have glow'd And shone for them. And so they seek the facile, and prefer The fairest first, nor slack their bridle-rein— As I, who heard this lonely murmurer, Turn to some brighter theme, away from her Whom God made plain. REST. I am weary, I am weary! though the happy springtide voices, Hope-inspiring, fear dispelling, are re-echoed on the breeze; Sad and drooping is my spirit, nor awakens nor rejoices, But it longs for rest, and babbling streams, and shadows under trees. Yes, to lie beneath a walnut-tree, or cedar, in a garden, Quaint, old-fashion'd, shut away from all the murmurs of the crowd, Of whose gate some sculptured figure, Love or Time, should be the warden, And where only voice of singing-birds should dare to breathe aloud— Where a sun-dial would seem shrinking, chaste and chilling, from the kisses Of the tender clinging clematis and star-like passion-flower; And the tremulous convolvulus, whose closing blue eye misses That faint shadow on the dial that foretells the evening hour. Yes, and tho' I long for Nature, yet I long and long for ever For a bowling-green which cypress shall environ on all sides— Kept and clipt from times departed into peacocks, urns, a river Too, with swans and water-lilies, and a lurking boat besides. Are you jealous? Nay! with you, love, sun and shade, and flowers and cedar— All with you, love! oh, my true love!—floating swans and lily-leaves; Cypress hedge with urns and peacocks—oh, my lover, lord, and leader! All with you, with you for ever, in these dreams my fancy weaves! Yes, my darling,—yes, with you, dear, shut away by iron gateways From the murmur, and the bustle, and the slander of the world; Yes, with you beneath the walnut-tree, near sunlit grassy pathways, By the dial round which the clusters of convolvulus are curl'd; Where the swans await their feeding by the lazy, reedy river, Where the boat lies moor'd away amongst the lilies by the shore: Ah, with you, love! oh, my true love! would for ever and for ever I could rest and dream and love you, and awake to life no more! THE RIDDLE. I ask not now, as once, what these things mean, This earth, these seeming trees that branch and bear, This good and evil, with this foul and fair, All things perceived with those that are unseen May go their ways, I neither ask nor care What these things mean. Once, as a pensive child, left all alone In some sad chamber on a rainy day, With an intricate puzzle for his play, Whereof the key or clue was lost and gone, I mused and marvell'd, trying every way What these things mean. Now I have thrown the puzzle in a heap, Go, painted plaything! thus I fling thee by. Either thou art too low or else too high To waste my care on. Vainly did I try: Now I am weary. Maybe by-and-by My dreams may tell me, when I fall asleep, What these things mean! A MEMORY. Where was the place? . . . Here are the wild white roses And clinging honeysuckle, and here a pathway Traced in the tall red fern. Alas! the changes Which break so many hearts, at least have mended That bent and broken bracken! So that surely These bleeding stems and leaves were not by thee, love, Thus crush'd to earth, but by some forest cattle, Some antler'd stag, or timid fawn when sleeping— Yet I had almost said thy vanish'd footprints, And mine of long ago, had mark'd for ever To memory sacred, this our place of trysting. The years—the years! . . . Each crowding generation Of tall green fern has risen (quaintly twisted And crook'd at first, like crozier of an abbot), And turned to russet, and the scythe has mown them, Laying their straight brown stems upon the green sward, For twenty autumns since that fateful autumn;— No vague transmitted legend, no tradition, No faintly floating mem'ry of that evening Is whisper'd by this heedless generation Of feath'ry bracken, when the ev'ning breezes Sway all the pigmy forest. E'en the roses Deem not their faded forefather is sleeping So near my heart! These twining honeysuckles Are not the pink and amber witnesses Of my first love, but fair, forgetful offspring Of those that tangled in my shining tresses Ere they were grey: I dare not say, my darling, What thou wert then to me, or how thy shadow Seems standing o'er me now as on that ev'ning! Alas, the years! the years! . . . How strange the bracken Should thus be crush'd and broken! Has the phantom Of our dead love held revel here by moonlight In bitter mockery? . . . The wild white roses Are here as then, the break amongst the bracken, The clinging pink and amber honeysuckle— This was the place. . . . TO TIME. Oh, Time! show mercy to me, and unwind This tangled web, or tear the strands away That twist and knot, and cause so great delay In this fair work I fashion'd to my mind, Help me, old Time! My hands are helpless; I have toil'd so long; Mine eyes are dim, my bobbins seem possess'd,— They will not twist the right way and the best, So all the texture will be netted wrong,— Help me, wise Time! This seems to thee, no doubt, a trivial thing; A woven shred, that will endure, alas! As short a while as on thy shifting glass Lingers the echo of Death's cross'd-bones' ring; Help me, good Time! Shuffle the strands aright; thou art too great To smart with envy at the little bliss So poor a worm as I may gain by this, Be on my side, and let us laugh at Fate; Help us, dear Time! TO A GARDEN. Oh, happy Eden! where I roam'd of yore In that sweet innocence I long for now,— No childish innocence of fruited bough, For I had bit my apple to the core; But when the golden fruit seem'd doubly sweet, (Unlike the tempter of a bygone day,) A serpent came, and bade me fling away What once he bade those first poor lovers eat. Oh, had I never bent that magic bough, And tasted of the sweetness that it bore, My heart had been as careless as before, And all these bitter tears unfalling now! I curse the cruel hand that pointed where My golden apple show'd a bitter flaw, And his malignant eye, who smiled and saw My best illusions melting into air! But garden,—garden where I used to rove, I bless thy orange groves and sunny sky, I bless thy feath'ry palm-trees tow'ring high, That overshadow'd what seem'd then my love! 1880. “The years pass on, the seasons go their round, Hate is o'erpass'd, Love plumes his fickle wings, Whilst, safe within his plot of garden-ground Mourning the mutability of things, The Poet sings.” A REVERIE. By the side of a ruin'd terrace I sat in the early Spring; The leaves were so young that the speckled hen-thrush Could be seen as she sat in the hawthorn bush, Falt'ring and faint at the cuckoo's cry; The cypress look'd black against the green Of folded chestnut and budding beech, And up from the slumbering vale beneath Came now and again the ominous ring Of a passing-bell for a village death. Yet a spirit of hope went whispering by, Through the wakening woods, o'er the daisied mead, And up the stem of the straight Scotch fir An insolent squirrel, in holiday brush, Went scampering gaily, at utmost speed, To gnaw at his fir-apples out of reach. All seem'd so full of life and stir, Of twitter and twinkle, and shimmer and sheen, That I closed my book, for I could not read; So I sat me down to muse instead, By the side of the ruin'd terrace, In the breath of the early Spring. Alas that the sound of a passing-bell, (Only proclaiming some villager's death,) As it echoes up from the valley beneath, Should summon up visions of trestle and shroud! And pity it is that yon marble urn, Fall'n and broken, should seem to tell Of days that are done with, and may not return Whatever the future shall chance to be! Hollow and dead as the empty shell Of last year's nut as it lies on the grass, Or the frail laburnum's wither'd seed, That hang like felons on gallows-tree! This is a truth that half aloud We may but murmur with bated breath: How many sat as I sit to-day, In the vanish'd hours of the olden time, Watching the Spring in her early prime Beam, and blossom, and go her way! Squirrels that sport and doves that coo, And leaves that twinkle against the blue, And green woodpecker and screeching jay, Ye are purposeless things that perish and pass, Yet you wanton and squander your transient day,— My soul is sicken'd at sight of you! “I had rather be shrouded and coffin'd and dead” (To my innermost soul I, sighing, said) “Than know no pleasure save love and play!” Then all seem'd so full of the odour of Death (Though I smelt the gorse-blossom blown from the heath), That I open'd my book and tried to read, Since my soul was too sadden'd to muse instead, By the side of the ruin'd terrace, In the breath of the early Spring. I wonder now if it could be right For the Great First Cause to let such things be? To plan this blending of black and white,— (I know, for myself, I had made all bright!) And to mould me, and make me, and set me here, Without my leave and against my will, With never so much as a word in mine ear As to how I may pilot my bark through the night? Was it well, I wonder, or was it ill, That I should feel such a wish to be wise, And dream of flying, and long for sight, With faltering footsteps and bandaged eyes, To be blamed the more that I may not see, As I stagger about in the wilderness, And know no more than the worms and the flies? I feel at my heart that it is not right— “Nothing is right and nothing is just; We sow in ashes and reap the dust; I think, on the whole, I would rather be The wandering emmet, that loses its way On the desert-plain of my muslin-dress, Than be moulded as either a woman or man.” (All this I said in my bitterness.) “Yet who is to help me and who is to blame?” But just at that moment a hurrying sound, A sound as of hurrying, pattering feet, In the dry leaves under the hawthorn bush, Troubled the heart of the speckled hen-thrush, Whilst the love-sick pigeon that call'd to her mate, And the green woodpecker and screeching jay, Outspread their wings and flew scared away; And on a sudden, with leap and bound, My neighbour's collie, mark'd black and tan, Sprang panting into the garden seat, His collar aglow with my neighbour's name! So my neighbour himself cannot be far, Ah, I care not now how wrong things are! . . . I know I am ignorant, foolish, and small As this wandering emmet that climbs my dress, Yet I know that now I had answer'd “Yes” (Were I ask'd my will by the Father of all); “I desire to be, I am glad to be born!” And all because on a soft May morn, My neighbour's collie dog, black and tan, Leapt over the privet-hedge, and ran With a rush, and a cry, and a bound to my side, And because I saw his master ride, Laying spurs to his willing horse, Over the flaming yellow gorse. Awake, my heart! I may not wait! Let me arise and open the gate, To breathe the wild warm air of the heath, And to let in Love, and to let out Hate, And anger at living, and scorn of Fate, To let in Life, and to let out Death, (For mine ears are deaf to the passing-bell— I think he is buried now out of the way;) And I say to myself, “It is good, it is well; Squirrels that sport and doves that coo, And leaves that twinkle against the blue, And green woodpecker and screeching jay,— Good-morrow, all! I am one of you!” Since now I need neither muse nor read, I may listen, and loiter, and live instead, And take my pleasure in love and play, And share my pastime with all things gay, By the side of the ruin'd terrace, In the breath of the early Spring. “GOING SOUTH.” I came from lands of mist and rain, And hurried, for one sleepless night, Through landscapes clothed in wintry white, And where the bare Burgundian vines, Like antlers of a buried herd, Pierced through their chilly counterpane. Against the windows sleet and snow Beat, as determin'd to the last To bear me company: I pass'd Bleak sandy tracks, where dwarfish pines And stunted olives, tempest-stirr'd, Swayed desolately to and fro. “I journey on to warmth and light,” I whisper'd to my falt'ring heart, So lonely at the saddest part Of this, my voyage to the sun, Wrapp'd in the curtains of the night, And fearing what the dawn might hold, Whilst still unto my aching brain The measured clatter of the train Echoed, in mocking monotone, “To warmth and light,” whilst all was cold. But by-and-by, by slow degrees, Chill Nature thaw'd to greet the dawn; The clinging frost and snow were gone, The sky beam'd blue behind the hills, The birds were singing on the trees. The sun rose gaily, all the earth Seemed warm again with love and Spring, The olive leaves sway'd glistening With silv'ry lustre, and the rills Leapt, frost-freed, to a brighter birth. A thousand scented southern balms The zephyr wafted to my brow, The orange hung upon the bough, The almond flower'd fair beneath The tufted majesty of palms. The wavelets of a tideless sea Crept softly to the rosy shore,— The overhanging mountains bore Myrtle and mignonette and heath, And fragrant tangled bryony. The aloe raised its pointed spears, The red geranium blossom'd wild, Anemones and violets smiled, The faint mimosa droop'd; above The rocks were fringed with prickly pears. 'Twas then I felt my soul revive; The winter chill'd my heart no more; I look'd upon that sunny shore, And said, “I come to life and love,— I come to thee to love and live.” TOO LATE! In the summer time, ere the grass was mown, Where the tall ox-daisies grew to her knee, There wander'd a maiden all alone, In silken kirtle and golden zone, By the river that flows to the sea. And often she look'd down its silvery way, As she watch'd the wandering swallows skim The leaves of the lilies, that quivering lay, Seeming only a span from the glittering bay, And her day-dreams were always of him. Thus wander'd she wearily to and fro Amongst the wavering meadow flowers, And she watch'd the seasons come and go Till the white with daisies was white with snow, And the birds fell asleep in the bowers. But her true love linger'd, and linger'd still, Till again the earth was awake with spring; And her heart grew sad, as a maiden's will Who has waited and watch'd over dale and hill For a love that is lingering. But at last, as, shading her eyes with her hand, She look'd down the river's silvery way, She 'spied a pinnace that made for the land, And that glided anon to the flowery strand That seem'd but a span from the bay. He has stept to the shore and found her fair, Yet he was not the hope of her life's young dream; Still he seem'd like the answer vouchsafed to a prayer, Ere her own true lover had time to be there, And he bore her away on the stream. But her true love will come ere the hawthorn sheds Its tremulous blossoms of virginal May, And he'll find but a sprinkling of daisy-heads, With a broken girdle in golden shreds, By the river that flows to the bay. A FOREBODING. I do not dread an alter'd heart, Or that long line of land or sea Should separate my love from me, I dread that drifting slow apart— All unresisted, unrestrain'd— Which comes to some when they have gain'd The dear endeavour of their soul. As two light skiffs that sail'd together, Through days and nights of tranquil weather, Adown some inland stream, might be Drifted asunder, each from each; When, floating with the tide, they reach The hoped-for end, the promised goal, The sudden glory of the sea. TO A COUNTRY DAFFODIL. With hanging head and fluted stalk, A golden herald of the Spring, Telling how thrushes build and sing Amongst the laurels in the walk Where we have also loved and sung, Come, daffodil, and whisper true, (Here amongst city fog and smoke,) What tidings of our trysting oak, Where squirrels sport and pigeons coo, As though the world were ever young? Tell me how all your brethren fare, Upstanding in the garden beds; And if the snowdrops' modest heads Look earthwards yet, or high in air, And if the crocuses are there? And if the forest-glades are gay With hyacinths, or silver-strewn With wood-anemones, too soon That bow their heads and pass away, Dying the death of all things fair? Tell me all this, and something more, What I would wish you most to tell,— Say, “He is true, and he is well, And still he loves you as before;” Then nestle near me, where you will. Or, if it please you to be seen And hold your head above them all I'll wear you at a royal ball, Where you may meet a future Queen— High honour for a daffodil! A MAY SONG. A little while my love and I, Before the mowing of the hay, Twined daisy-chains and cowslip-balls, And caroll'd glees and madrigals, Before the hay, beneath the may, My love (who loved me then) and I. For long years now my love and I Tread severed paths to varied ends; We sometimes meet, and sometimes say The trivial things of every day, And meet as comrades, meet as friends, My love (who loved me once) and I. But never more my love and I Will wander forth, as once, together, Or sing the songs we used to sing In spring-time, in the cloudless weather; Some chord is mute that used to ring, Some word forgot we used to say Amongst the may, before the hay, My love (who loves me not) and I! A REGRET. “Yours be the blame,” she said, and sigh'd; “Yours be the blame for all I feel”— She turn'd away upon her heel, And saw him leave her wonder-eyed; Then suddenly, with no “Good-bye,” Before the morrow came he died. Of what avail then sighs or tears For spoken words that left a sting? Will he remember anything Of that which haunts her thro' the years, Or hear the echo of her sigh, Or share the burden that she bears? “Mine was the blame!” she weeps and cries, “Oh, love! my love! mine was the blame!” He does not answer to his name, Or soothe her now with soft replies, His form is hid from human eye, His mind is closed to memories. THE KINGFISHER. A BALLAD. I. Beside the leafy river-bed, Waving with wealth of willow-weeds, Poised in the pollard overhead, We watch'd him from amongst the reeds. Bright as a jewel to behold, His bosom flashing tropic hues,— Purple and amaranth and gold, With emerald greens and peacock blues. You held the brambles o'er my head, And bade me neither speak nor stir; “Stay still a little while,” you said, “Or we shall scare the kingfisher.” The cruel kingfisher stayéd on, Peering o'er weed and watercress, Until the lilies one by one, Folded their leaves for weariness. You held aside the briers and bine; We did not speak, we did not stir; But by-and-by your lips sought mine— We kiss'd, and scared the kingfisher. II. Now once again I seek the stream Waving with purple willow-weed; A flutt'ring sound, a flashing gleam— The kingfisher has flown to feed. There still the water-lilies grow, Here trail the sprays of brier and bine, As on that day, so long ago, When first your faithless lips met mine. The cruel kingfisher stays on, Peering o'er weed and watercress; And now the lilies, one by one, Fold up their leaves for weariness. Recalling all I would forget, I do not speak, I do not stir; My heart is full, my eyes are wet— I weep and scare the kingfisher. A WEDDING. He stands before the altar-rails To plight his troth to her—a child, Who had not heard the o'er true tales Of his rash youth and manhood wild. And overhead are smiling skies, As though to augur all is well; And village swains Sing merry strains, And gaily rings the village bell. She little knows, that lily bride, What those glad joy-bells said to one, Who, sitting by her lone fireside, Nursed tearfully her little son. Yet overhead are smiling skies, As though to augur all is well; To drown the sighs That may arise, Sing, village swains! Ring, village bell! “IN GREEN OLD GARDENS.” In green old gardens, hidden away From sight of revel and sound of strife, Where the bird may sing out his soul ere he dies, Nor fears for the night, so he lives his day; Where the high red walls, which are growing gray With their lichen and moss embroideries, Seem sadly and sternly to shut out Life, Because it is often as sad as they; Where even the bee has time to glide (Gathering gaily his honey'd store) Right to the heart of the old-world flowers,— China-asters and purple stocks, Dahlias and tall red hollyhocks, Laburnums raining their golden showers, Columbines prim of the folded core, And lupins, and larkspurs, and “London pride;”— Where the heron is waiting amongst the reeds, Grown tame in the silence that reigns around, Broken only, now and then, By shy woodpecker or noisy jay, By the far-off watch-dog's muffled bay; But where never the purposeless laughter of men, Or the seething city's murmurous sound Will float up under the river-weeds. Here may I live what life I please, Married and buried out of sight,— Married to pleasure, and buried to pain,— Hidden away amongst scenes like these, Under the fans of the chestnut trees; Living my child-life over again, With the further hope of a fuller delight, Blithe as the birds and wise as the bees. In green old gardens hidden away From sight of revel and sound of strife,— Here have I leisure to breathe and move, And to do my work in a nobler way; To sing my songs, and to say my say; To dream my dreams, and to love my love; To hold my faith, and to live my life, Making the most of its shadowy day. “IF ONLY WE HAD TIME TO SPARE.” If only we had time to spare To taste the glories of the Spring, How good to leave this noise and glare, And breathe the blessèd country air, And hear the songs the wild birds sing, If only we had time to spare! Then you should stretch you at my feet And read aloud, and I should sew, And now and then our eyes might meet, And we might murmur phrases sweet, And blissful hours would come and go, If only we had time to spare! But as you toil, and as I pray For happier and idler hours, Noon follows dawn, night follows day, I look, and lo, your locks are gray, And Winter withers up our flowers Ere ever we have time to spare! UNDER A LATTICE. FROM THE SPANISH. “Clung round with clematis the lattice stands Still open, open'd by those vanish'd hands; Within, a darker day, a lesser light, Recalls the vision that has taken flight— A vision of soft eyes and hanging hair, And all that, until yesterday, was there, And nestled near my heart, and seem'd mine own, And loved me yesterday, and now—is flown! “O empty open window, from above Send down some dear memento of my love! Some perfume, sweeter than the clematis, Some truant echo of a lingering kiss! Or were it even but one little hair (Trapp'd in a tendril as she watch'd me there), How would I treasure in my lonely breast Such falling feather from our empty nest!” So sigh'd I, lonely, when an agèd man, Who, passing, saw my sorrow, thus began With words of wisdom to reprove my gloom: “My son,” said he, “once in yon very room I, too, in days which live in fancy yet, Tasted the happiness you now regret; And when my happiness had pass'd away, I, too, stood sighing where you stand to-day. “But not all neatly shod and gaily dress'd, My love departed from our nuptial nest On tassell'd mule, or in a soft sedan, Wafting an arch ‘Good-morrow!’ from her fan, And almost surely to return again.— Wan as a lily-bell, my love was lain In that poor narrow bed we all must know, Beside a lesser lily, white as snow (Ah, sorry bridal bed for one so fair!). And though my heart broke not with my despair, Yet was it very weary with my pain, And weary are these eyes that watch in vain, And may not see what once they held so dear; Wherefore, on this one day in ev'ry year, I seek this hostelrie and here repine: Know now, my son, my woes outmeasure thine.” He ended, and in grateful mood I said, “Thank God, though gone from me, she is not dead!” WAITING. Pleasant it is to watch and wait By lone seashore or forest dell, For some one that we love so well; We half are glad he comes so late (When we can count his coming sure). Since then we taste our promised good Ere ever he can wend his way By the blue curve of shining bay, Or thro' the tangle of the wood, (For we can count his coming sure). And earth, and sky, and forest tree, Or far expanse of silv'ry sand, Seem touch'd as with a magic wand, And glorious with a joy to be (Since we can count his coming sure). 'Tis even thus I wait him here, And scan afar the forest glades, And wander through the green arcades, And strive to know his presence near, (If I can count his coming sure). But as I watch, and as I wait, The ev'ning shadows grow apace, The last rook seeks its roosting-place, The latest swain goes through the gate, Ah, can I count his coming sure? THE SILENT PLAYER. AT “HAMLET,” December 30, 1878. I meant to write of Hamlet; how he mouth'd Or did not mouth enough, or how he seem'd More mad than should a prince in ecstasy, Or strangely sane: of what was Shakespeare's mind Concerning Hamlet: Whether 'twas his will To make him mad, or merely seeming so, Because he dared not set such lib'ral speech Into a sane man's mouth in times like his. And next I meant to cavil at the dress, The feather'd bonnet, and the silken hose; Then laud the earnest effort made, and ask If this were genius, and then reply I know not wholly what. . . . Then had I praised, And more than praised, nor nearly praised enough, The fair Ophelia, form and voice and face Seeming a sweet incarnate revelation Of the great Master's mind. Or, like a saint Frighten'd from off some high cathedral-pane By sun or moonbeam, essence of a dream, Too fair for flesh and blood, yet shedding tears, Real briny tears, for love of mortal man! Thus had I meant to write; but, looking round From where I sat in cosy cushion'd chair, I saw, above, below, in box and stall, A serried line of critics, with their gaze Intent and fix'd, all “eager for the fray;” Dealers of thunderbolts, which, ready poised, Would fall to-morrow. Then I felt abash'd, And half-ashamed, and murmur'd to myself, “Wilt thou, poor poet, lift thy pigmy pen And pass thy raw opinion on the players, When even these may fail to read them right, And blunder with their bombshells?” So I turn'd From black-browed Hamlet with his waving plume, From golden-hair'd Ophelia and her flowers, From guilty King and “seeming-virtuous” Queen, From old Polonius, staunch Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, well-favour'd Osric, Gravediggers, courtiers, players; I left the lot, Lacking the nerve to tackle e'en the Ghost, And went, forthwith, and took the lowest place As critic of the least amongst them all— A silent actor—only a sad skull, Upheaved not even from a natural grave. “Alas, poor Yorick!” He that play'd the part Of that poor pate of thine play'd passing well, And spoke, in silence, plainer than the rest! My heart went out to him, and wonder'd whether His freed soul watch'd the actors, Hamlet-wise, And if in anger, or in sympathy, Gnawing the feathers from a phantom-fan, Or clapping kindly with his spirit-hands? And what had been that other part he play'd, Play'd out (how long ago?) as king or clown, Soldier or scholar, honest man or knave? Whether from desecrated marble urn, Or from the quicklime of a felon's grave, These bones were gather'd that played here tonight? There must be cruel choice of dead men's bones Whilst rulers make new wars, and martyr'd saints', Whilst men, misnamed of peace, arise, and fan The smould'ring fires betwixt opposing creeds, Thinking to do God service. So, poor skull, It may be that thou hast roll'd hitherward (Bereft of aureole or warrior's helm) From the sad cell of some sweet Magdalen, Or from the furrows of a tented field Whereon thou wert a victor! Who can say? But, be thou that which little Peterkin Found, “smooth and round,” “beside the rivulet,” A waif from Blenheim, or some virgin's skull Filch'd from the far-famed thousands at Cologne, Thou'st play'd thy part right well, and told tonight An old, old story! Moralising thus, I don my cloak, and clasp a careless arm, Then drive to supper. . . . DIVIDED. They did not quarrel; but betwixt them came Combining circumstances, urging on Towards the final ending of their loves. Could they have smote and stung with bitter words, Then sued for pardon on a blotted page, And met, and kiss'd, and dried their mutual tears, This had not been. But every day the breach Widen'd without their knowledge. Time went by, And led their footsteps into devious paths, Each one approving, nay, with waving hand Praying God-speed the other, since both roads Seem'd fair, and led away from sordid things, And each one urged the other on to fame. He was a very Cæsar for ambition; And she, a simple singer in the woods, Athirst for Nature—ever needing her To crown a holiday, and sanctify As with a mother's blessing, idle hours. A bramble-blossom trailing in the way Seem'd more to her than all his talk of Courts And Kings and Constitutions; but his aims Rose far above the soaring of the lark, That leaves the peeping daisy out of sight. The State required him, and he could not stay Loit'ring and ling'ring in the “primrose path Of dalliance;” and so it came to pass These two, that once were one, are two again. And she is lone in spirit, having known A sweeter thing than pipe of nightingale Or scent of hawthorn, and yet loving these And clinging to them still, though desolate, And, like the lady of the “Lord of Burleigh,” Lacking the “Landscape-painter” in her life. Thus, all her songs are sad—of wither'd leaves, And blighted hopes, and echoes of the past, And early death; and yet she cannot die, But lives and sings, as he, too, lives and climbs, Far from the sight of waving meadow-grass, And so they walk divided. Were it well So soon to sever such a tender tie, With never a reproach and none to blame, And not one tear? With friendly greetings now At careless meetings, cold and unforeseen, As though no better days had ever dawn'd; And all—for what? . . . Nay, be it for the best! Who knows, if we love well till we regret And sigh, in sadness, for a good thing gone? Thus, all may work to wisdom. Wherefore, wake With wind-strewn cuckoo-bloom and daffodil, Fond foolish love of spring-tide and hot youth And die when these have perish'd! . . . ANOTHER SPRING. They are here again, with their mocking notes, Cuckoo, and linnet, and nightingale— “Welcome to Spring!” from a thousand throats That trill and quaver through wood and vale. Yet there, on his bed, lies the dead man, pale, And these blossoming limes, in their holiday coats, Wave over a kingdom of husk and shell, Of broken branch and of mouldering leaf. But the young leaves live; so I say, “It is well,— It is well with an old and a new belief; There is Death beneath us, and Life above, And betwixt the two, for a transient spell, Ere the March-strewn seed shall be bound in the sheaf, There is lent us a little time to love.” THE PEAR-TREE. A little garden once I knew But just outside the city's brawl, Wherein a twisted pear-tree grew Above a grey old-fashion'd wall; And in those days I used to wait And hunger for a coming tread, And fifty times would seek the gate Before the length'ning shadows spread. And then, against the evening sky, That tufted pear-tree, in the gloom, I liken'd to a Cherokee, With tomahawk and waving plume. And when his brow seem'd bland and kind, I said, “I have not long to wait;” Then once more drew aside the blind, Or sought again the garden-gate. But if his brow was blurr'd with storm, And wildly waved his floating feather, And all the outline of his form Was rack'd and rent with angry weather,— I took it for a luckless sign, Fearing some evil might arise, And watch'd the gath'ring planets shine With aching heart and anxious eyes. “He will be late,” I used to say,— “Nay, will he even come at all?” Seeing the Indian's figure sway Above the old grey garden-wall. Ah, foolish fancies, past and dead! Ah, little garden, green and gay! Who listens now for coming tread, Or threads your narrow paths to-day? Once have I pass'd your lichen'd wall Whereon the tangled creepers climb, And peep'd within the gate, but all Seemed alter'd by the touch of Time. And, looking up to where, of yore, There waved the well-known wishing-tree, My heart grew doubly sad—it bore No likeness to a Cherokee! “DOLCE FAR NIENTE.” . . . So now, my love, what matter when we die, And leave this world of sorrow-faring men, Wielders of sword, and drivers of the pen, Who fret, and fume, and strive, I know not why, Since all my life is turn'd to holiday! Here will I rest me, lying in the shade, And smile to see men toiling in the sun, The end achieved, the promised guerdon won, Deep drinking of the draught for which I pray'd, Whilst all the world seems turn'd to holiday. Death would be pleasant so, should no sharp pain Curdle the blood or agonise the mind, So, hearts united, and so, arms entwined, We two could fade out from this mortal train Who find scant space for making holiday. You say 'tis no man's mission to lie so, Watching the sunlight sifting through green boughs; You tell of men who breathed heroic vows, Smote, or were smitten, and were glad to go, And knew no time for love or holiday. “Up and away!” you say, “from scenes like these, Where languid nights succeed the listless days, Seek out some poor man's good, some good man's praise; Nor lie, like Samson, at Delilah's knees, Making all life to seem like holiday.” Ah! this from thee, Delilah, this from thee! Who taught the shepherd to forsake his flocks? Who stole his heart, and shear'd away his locks? No good man now shall speak good word of me, So let all life seem love and holiday! AT MIDNIGHT. A shadow stands outside my door, Through all the noontide din; But when the revels of day are o'er I rise and let it in. The voices are hush'd, and the lights are dead, When I open the doorway wide, And the curtains are drawn around the bed Where you sleep by my side. Then I talk to my guest in accents low, And I live the old life anew With the ghost of a man, dead long ago, Whom I loved far better than you! IN AN IRISH CHURCHYARD. Amongst these graves where good men lie, Mute, ozier-bound, in dreamless sleep, Above whose heads the browsing sheep And careless painted butterfly Pasture and sport in summer grass, Brown as the blasted Dead Sea fruit, As bann'd to barrenness and dearth, Behold yon patch of rusty earth, Whereon no turf has taken root, No summer shadows flit and pass; Whilst here, a garden neat and trim, All fuchsia-fringed and pansy-starr'd, With gilded gateways lock'd and barr'd, And double-daisies for a rim Surrounds a tomb, with foot and head Guarded by angel-forms that weep In marble from Carrara's mines, Whilst Fame a laurel chaplet twines, And golden letters, graven deep, Blazon the honours of the dead. He died as clarions smote the air To tell of vict'ry and renown; They brought him to his native town, Near which the lands and lordships were That owed him fealty in the west. She died in those despairing days, Bow'd down by all the griefs she had, And only that they deem'd her mad, They buried her by no cross-ways, And drove no stake into her breast. She sleeps beneath yon rusty peat, Withered as by avenging fires; Amongst the noblest of his sires He lies with angels at his feet, And golden gates to keep secure. And 'twixt the two, all ozier-bound, Half melted into mother earth, Scarce two feet long, by one in girth, A little nameless baby-mound Pleads for the sins of rich and poor. THE POET. The poet was not born to teach A moral lesson to mankind; He hath no solemn creed to preach, But, fancy-free and unconfined, By sunlit glade or grey sea-beach His lyre wakes to the shifting wind. And if he be a minstrel true, Its ev'ry sound should charm your ears, Of ev'ry cloud the changing hue Should bear some fruit in smiles or tears, And all his songs should waft to you An echo of some voice he hears. Thus, true to Nature and to Art, He flings his music on the gale; And even should its tones impart But gall and bitterness, and fail To ease his own o'erburden'd heart, And prove to yours of no avail, From love of song alone he sings, And as his mood is foul or fair His voice in tune or discord rings, No matter, so the voice be there, And should his lyre e'en snap its strings He will not know, he will not care! “TILL ALL THINGS FADE.” A thousand lilies blossom, unaware, Here, where the earth seems chill with buried love, And in the flow'ry arbutus the dove Still calls her truant mate, who lingers yet, As though the world were always sweet and fair, And you and I had nothing to regret And hope for against hope, and think upon Till all things fade! And so your lips may often wear a smile, And so my heart may leap to music still; Your soul may fire, and all your being thrill, And all your manhood lift itself on high In din of battle, or in sacred aisle; Yet under all must lurk one memory, The grieving for a good time that is gone, Till all things fade! AT TWILIGHT. The day is ended—this autumn day, So like to the days that have ended before; The knock of a friend, maybe at the door, Who gives his greeting, and says his say, And then goes his way. The posts are all in, and the news all read— There is fighting abroad, and carping here— We have heaved a sigh, and smother'd a tear, As we pored o'er the printed names of the dead Ere the daylight fled. The flocks are in fold, and the steeds in stall, And the moon is as red as a rising sun; Whilst in twos and threes, or one by one, The ploughmen (thinking of nothing at all) Pass under the wall. I would I could think of as little as they, As they whistle along in their holland smocks! Bound for the home where the cradle rocks, And the good-wife spreads them their suppertray At close of the day. But on us, who wonder and question and think, Crowd weightier fancies, as daylight sets, Hungers and thirstings and vain regrets That may not be sated with meat and with drink, Or with poet's ink. Fancies that never may stalk in the light— Hovering phantoms of profitless hours, Lingering odours of withering flowers, Wavings of wings that have taken their flight— These come with the night. Yet whilst I can look in a true friend's face, And thrill to the touch of a loving hand, I suffer no fear, but can take my stand And hold myself ready to lie in my place At the end of the race. To the length of our days this day adds one (One link the more as the chain grows long); Let us warm it with kisses and wreath it with song, And mingle together our sands, as they run With the days that are done.

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE SECOND 1880. THE CENTENARIAN. One hundred years! . . . Yet all the world seems young, And, like my heart, still throbbing to the tune Of soft recurring music! . . . Flower-wise, Budding, and bearing blossom and ripe fruit, The hopes and aspirations of old time Would put forth branch and tendril, and unfold Facing the sunlight, but a spectre-hand, Bony, and shrunken, as is now mine own, Blights ev'ry blossom, even in the bud, Whilst croaking accents whisper in mine ear, “Stay! Thou art old! . . . But three-score years and ten Is man's appointed time upon the earth; What matter if the heart within thy breast Keeps cognisance of spring or winter-time, Storm or fine weather, ebb or flow of tide, Or changing moons? So, in a ruin'd hall May wond'ring men hear some old timepiece tick Through sudden jar of outward circumstance, Then sink again to silence. Young men dream, And plan and build, and sowing, hope to reap; But thou, mere accident and freak of Fate, Wait in thy dreamless twilight, nor presume To seek preferment in the banner'd lists Where Youth strives on, and Beauty yields the prize!” Ay, even so! . . . And yet, not long ago (Or so it seems to me), mine eyes were bright, My cheeks aglow, and all the blood aflame In these poor knotted veins! Then, with the rest, By flower-strewn lawn or trellis'd window-pane I too could sing of love, whilst rosy lips Smiled down responsive! . . . I remember, once, Walking in summer, by the green sea-downs, With one I loved unwittingly the while; The sky was blue, and on the bluer wave We saw the changing ships, like white-wing'd moths, Flit down the far sea-line, or, merged in sky, Race with the clouds. Sheer from the hanging cliff Clung bramble-blossoms, myrtle, and wild heath, Whilst far ahead, a forest of black firs Bearded the ocean-bank, and seem'd a goal Whither we two were bound,—to what intent My schoolboy heart wist not. Fine flower of speech Comes not to lads o'er soon, and I remember, Looking from right to left, from sea to shore, From glow of heaven to bloom of maidenhood, My soul seem'd bound in silence, whilst the girl Talk'd on of many things,—mere sounding words Beside the secret gnawing at my heart, The which she guess'd,—being a woman born, Although I dared not tell it to myself, Fearing, maybe, to lose it. By-and-by, Passing in front of me, she reached her hand Seaward, to gather from the jutting cliff Blossom or branch, when, sudden, crashing down Fell shower of loosen'd stones and tufted grass, Whilst on the utmost edge, I saw my love Clinging for very life to yielding briers, And calling me, with horror in her eyes, To save her if I loved her. All this scene Is clear as yesterday, and yet the years Have blurr'd out later memories! Ah, then (When I had thought her dead, and laid her down Upon the sward, beneath the straight-stemm'd firs) My words came fast enough! . . . She did not die, But now, or she is dead, or old, so old,— I dare not think of her; her fair face fled From out the world! And whither? (if she lives)— Ah, whither? . . . whither? . . . Gone to meet mine own Of long ago, that bending down to hers There in the deep'ning twilight, found her lips. And this was over eighty years ago! . . . A long man's life! Ah, God, be good to me, Nor let my living turn to a reproach Till men shall mock at me! . . . I know not wherefore To-day, whilst looking from this balcony At sky, and ocean, with its many sails, This memory came to me, with the scent Of brine and seaweed. Even thus, that day, Like mimic ships, and dragons, and strong towers, And floating seraphs, wing'd, with streaming hair, Seem'd all the hurrying clouds, and, as to-day, So on that yesterday of long ago The sea-birds, white against the ocean-blue, Look'd larger than the ships. . . . If it had chanced That some one, then, had said, “On such a day Your soul shall sicken as your dimming sight Beholds what now you gaze on,” I had smiled, Nor deem'd it possible. So lightly fell In those light days, the shadow on my path, Which needs must chill the life-blood of the world Were we not made so blind, for pity's sake, That our dull eyes refuse to look on it. Yet, all the while the clock goes ticking on, Time shifts his glass, and the impatient sands Crowd onward to the end! . . . . . . Young men, and strong, Were those three sons, begotten in my youth, That halt and falter now for very age, And seem so many sires; save he that died— Mine eldest-born, struck down in summer-prime, He is a young man still! With hound and horn Scours he, through time, the happy hunting-grounds? Or 'midst the twanging of eternal harps (His seeing too intense to light on us) Loses he taint and consciousness of earth, Whilst planets run their course, and suns subside, And man, in his poor ant-hill, toils and strives, And loves, and hates, and suffers? . . . Ah, how small, How poor a thing, O Lord, with all made smooth, Is this our life! A little emmet's hour, Wherein we have not even time to frame The scaffolding for mere foundation of thought! One hundred years! . . . And am I better strung To meet adversity? . . . Yea, better far, Wiser and stronger, as a corpse is wise And strong to suffer, bearing scorn of fate, Buffet of foe, and kissing of sweet lips, Bearing all these alike! . . . One hundred years! And all so green at core, so notched of bark, The two men of me made so manifest The soul would seem to wrestle with the flesh And taunt it for a laggard! 'Tis as though I took my way through life in hood and mask, My inner self conceal'd, yet ready primed To leap to action! In the damp church-vaults Dare they to fasten down this eager spirit That chafes his fainter brother, and would fly With yonder sea-gull o'er the streak of gold Flecking the far horizon? Wherefore here (In this my breast) lives fire at noble deed, Desire for bold endeavour and high truth, Or hunger for dear love, whilst eyes are dim, Whilst footsteps falter, and this wan white beard Mocks me without the mirror, straying down To meet the beating of my baffled heart? I say, to keep me brave, “He cannot die, This inner man, that rises up so strong Within the crumbling stonework of his prison:” But Reason hath a voice as well as Hope, And in some seasons, crouching at my side, She drones her dismal teachings! . . . It was strange That on this ev'ning, looking at the ships, My mind went back, ay, even eighty years, To hug a ling'ring memory! The ships Sail on and on, across the window-square, And pass and vanish; it is even so With us and our endeavour! . . . Draw the blinds, And close the window, for the ev'ning air Gnaws at my heart, and chills the weaker man; Ay, but the soul is rampant, and will live To set its foot upon this wither'd flesh And cry out “Victory!” One hundred years! If God hath not forgotten me, ere long I too may read His riddle. . . . I must wait! . . A LETTER. “I am sitting alone in the garden to-day, though the summer is well-nigh dead; We have gathered the fruit, and garner'd the hay, and the withering woods are red, And the beds on the terrace are yet aglow, and the roses are clustering still, But the tenderer blossoms are all laid low, and the evening breeze grows chill. A time-serving robin comes chirruping near; he is 'ware of a terrible day, When the beds shall be bare and the woodlands sere, so he chirrups while chirrup he may. The children are shouting, with kite and with ball, away by the hazel-wood lane, And I—I have stolen away from them all, just to write to you once again. “But of what can I tell you, my only friend? That I miss you by night and by day? That the dreariest hours are these that I spend since the one when you journey'd away? That your form seems beside me when others are by, and your head on my bosom at night? That regrets will arise and ambitions die,—is it thus that you would I should write? Or else, of the questions up yonder, in town; of the waverings to and fro, Of the spirits of men, reeling up and down, as uncertain of whither to go? They are dallying now with a Christless creed, for the olden-time fancies seem dead, Like flowers that have wither'd and run to seed, and men raise up these new ones instead. But the tree is too fresh in the soil as yet, and they know not what fruit it will bear; And so still there are some with their minds firm-set t'wards the desolate altars that were; Whose feet seem to wander away from the light, into shadowy pathways well trod, Calling out for their Eve, or their Aphrodite, or Mary the mother of God. “But around me these clamouring voices arose as the sound of an unknown tongue, Or the caws from yon cloud of harvesting crows flying home from the fields with their young; It may seem to you strange that I hope and wait, knowing well that I never may know; But I sit in my twilight, and bow to my fate, contented that things should be so; Whilst I hear of man rising up after man, asking who it was kicked off the ball? It was so, I am told, since the world began, 'twill be so to the ending of all. “But, as heedless of all these changes of thought, of this vast under-current of Doubt, We smiled and we sorrow'd, we sold and we bought, and we jested at dance and at rout. There was never an echo'd step on the stair, or a form at the turn of the street, But my heart leapt up ready to greet you there, and to throb at the sound of your feet. Yet here, where the bracken waves under the pine, and the heather glows pink on the hill,— It is here, in this home that was yours and mine, that your spirit seems lingering still; And, on days like this, when the summer is done, and the children are gone to their play, I can sit me down in the garden alone, and say all that I hunger to say. For it seems to me now, at the turn of the year, ere the tempests of Winter blow, I must send a ‘good morrow’ to you, my dear, even whether you hear it or no; For it lightens my heart of some part of its woe, and dries some of the tears that I weep, Ere I seek for the worthiest blossoms that blow, which may die on the turf where you sleep.” THE GHOST STORY. Round-eyed and open-eared, the children sat To hear the story, by their mother's knee, Close to the glowing hearth. Without, the wind Made mournful music—sighing at the pane And rocking the great cedars. Now and then Fox-tail of fir, or swaying ivy spray, Or leaf, storm-driven, seem'd a goblin hand Feeling to find the bolt and enter in. A sense of mystery was in the air; Familiar things look'd other than their wont; Even the calm face of the ticking clock Seem'd human, and the flick'ring tongues of flame Fiend-like and ominous. “On such a night— On such a night as this” (the mother spoke, Whilst all the children nestled near her gown)— “On such a night as this—long, long ago, When ladies' shoes were pointed, and their robes Of cloth-of-gold, trimm'd round with miniver, Like kings' and queens' upon the playing-cards— Just so the tempest howled—on such a night.” “Oh!” cried the children (ev'ry yellow hair Bristling expectant, as each cherub face Paled with a growing ecstasy of horror). “Remember,” said the mother, as she raised Her slender fingers, all aglow with rings,— “Remember, first, the story is not true, Since well we know that fairies and poor ghosts, Will-o'-the-wisps, magicians, and the like,— All these, with vampires, witches, and wehr-wolves, Are only meant to live in story-books, And speed a winter's evening; rest assured This world we live in is no place for them; No one has seen them, save with fever'd brain Or tortured fancy; but, suppose their sight Healthful, and ev'ry fancied phantom real, A poor sad ghost, at best a very shade, Could do no harm to spirits joined to flesh, Since these are far the stronger—two to one. But, once for all, before my tale begins, You know it is not true.” “We know, we know, We know it is not true,” the children cried; “Yet tell it all the same!” “Long, long ago” (The story thus began), “in ancient times, An old grey Baron, with an only girl, Dwelt in a castle, peak'd and turreted, In Picardy.” And then the mother told Of siege and sally and assault of arms, Of drawbridge hoisted, and of loopholes lined With cross-bow men, whose shafts so swiftly sped They seem'd a very rainfall, wing'd and barb'd. And then she told how, foremost in the fray, As victor, too, at tilt and tournament And deeds of daring, was a youthful knight, Of noble presence, who had gain'd by stealth The maiden's love, with promise of her hand; Which should her sire withhold, the lady swore To wed no other. So the days went by; And, hoping still, nor daring tell his hope To the stern father, lest he dash it down, The knight, to make preferment doubly sure Through braver show of prowess, bade adieu To France and lady-love, and bent his way (After renewal of his plighted troth) To Palestine, to fight the Saracen. Then pined the lady in her castle-bower, And all day long disconsolate she sat, Her lute discarded and her silks unwound, Dreaming beside the lattice. Suns and moons Rose and declined, and re-arose anew, And still he came not. Then the years went by, The weary years, and still he did not come; And at her heart there grew a gnawing fear That he had fallen in battle. Suns and moons Rose and declined afresh, and re-arose; And then (the tidings of his certain death Stunning her into marble) she was wed, As one sleep-walking, to a worthy man, Her father's friend and all as old as he, Yet brave and excellent. And as one night (On such a night as this), beside the hearth She sat, and watch'd the flick'ring of the flames, That leapt and darted, whilst in high-back'd chair Half-slumber'd the good knight her graybeard spouse, And then (as now) the winds of heaven, let loose, Made roar and tumult, all her heart grew sad Through thinking of her love of long ago, The Picard knight, that sometime over sea Was slain in battle of the Saracen. Her heart grew sad, and both her eyes grew dim; When, looking up, alert at sudden sound, Uprose the lazy bloodhound at her feet, And shook himself, and growl'd. With startled cry, Hands clasp'd, and hair unbound, and eyes amazed, She sprang towards the door; since there, array'd In coat of mail, his visor all unhook'd, And his face pale as is the face of death,— There stood the form of him she counted slain— The Picard knight! Then all the children cried (The eldest calming with her soothing hand A shudd'ring sister), “Ah, it was a ghost! It was a ghost! The story is not true!” “Nay,” said the mother, “it was not a ghost (Though had it been, the less her cause for fear); For though he neither spoke, nor clasp'd her hand, Looking but very sorrowful indeed, And so departing, it was told next day How some retainers, loit'ring at the gate, Had seen the young knight enter, with his train, Nor had they question'd one they knew for friend; So let him pass, and after, pass away, When (riding out) a varlet, leaning back, Hiss'd out this parting wager to a page, ‘If my good master steers from Palestine Cleft in the skull, and hinder'd in the reach, A second time, alive, take thou my steed, Trappings and all, and this my trusty brand, And smite me for a liar!’ Jesting thus, The retinue pass'd out across the bridge, Their leader silent. He had seen and known, And all his heart grew bitter; and, once more, Stricken alike in body and in soul, He sought the Holy Land, to fight afresh, And try forgetting.” Then the mother told How, overshadowed by a memory, The lady lived a sad though peaceful life, Praying much secretly, and how, at length, (As years went on), such curly heads as theirs That listen'd now intently to the tale Were group'd around her knees. And once again, When all of these lay sleeping in their beds, She sat at Christmas-time beside the hearth, Watching the great yule log that flaked and fell, Crumbling and flaring, as it lay at length Betwixt the brazen dogs; when, suddenly, She heard a sound as of a troop of horse Spurring across the drawbridge furiously, As though pursued; and scarcely this had died When a chill blast flutter'd the arras-folds That hid the doorway, and within it stood The young Crusader, pale as heretofore, Yet with a milder look, which seem'd to say, “Thy fault is pardoned.” “And was this a ghost?” Asked all the children. “Yes,” the mother said, “This was a ghost indeed (so runs the tale,— As true a ghost as lives in story-books); For, fighting out in Palestine, the knight Was truly slain in battle; and once dead, He grasp'd all wisdom, and he knew her heart, And so forgave her.” Here the mother paused, And, gazing at the embers of the fire, As one that strains o'er utmost edge of sea, Nor knows what lies between, she seem'd alone With some sad fancy, or as if, by chance, All imperceptibly, the story took Its colour from her own that told the tale, And stirr'd a buried depth. For there are times When, through some transient outward influence, Sighing of autumn winds, or bar of song, Or scent of garden-blossoms, thoughts arise Which hold us spellbound. “Is the story done?” The children ask'd at length; and, thus aroused, With quick-drawn sigh, she said, “The tale is done;” Then, one by one, impatient of her mood, They slipp'd away, and left her there alone, Musing beside the embers. Leaning back, A feather fan held lightly in her hand, What voices seem to murmur in her ears From out the dying embers in the hearth! What airy castles, peak'd and turreted, Rise at her bidding! Hath her fancy fled Back to the olden time, and fall those tears Through thinking of the youthful Picard knight That died in Palestine, or for the dame Who, loving well, yet broke her plighted troth And wed another, proving loyal wife, And looking only on her lover's face In ghostly vision? Who may read aright Tear-drop or passing smile, or guess her mind, As, out of sight, she hears the children cry, “Remember this was very long ago, When ladies' shoes were pointed, and their robes, Like kings' and queens' upon the playing-cards, Trimm'd round with miniver; besides, you know, The story is not true.” TIME. I. Of Time what may a poet sing, Who sees his seasons come and go, With heart that falters and eyes askance? Who reads with sad prophetic glance The pitiful tale of the dead rose-garden All folded away in the buds of the spring, And dreams, awake, of the summer glow, Whilst snow-flakes fall, and whilst hoar-frosts harden, Yet hopes for nothing from change or chance,— How may a poet sing, and know? II. Let him rise and tune to a mingled measure, Blood and roses alike bloom red— Pleasure in pain, and pain in pleasure— Bitter the hunger, and bitter the bread! Time will tarnish a tawdry treasure, Turn gold to silver, and silver to lead; Rise up and tune to a mingled measure: Of Time, our master, what may be said? III. Boy and girl we have play'd together, Hearts in slumber, and heads in air— Maiden trim with the floating feather, Sailor-lad, with a future clear, Snatching a kiss as he climb'd the stair— (“Kiss me,” he said, on the twilight stair, Half for pastime, and half in sorrow)— Sailor-lad, that would sail to-morrow Out to the uttermost hemisphere. A few hot tears, and a lock of hair, And a widow'd heart in the summer weather, A widow'd heart for the half of a year, And the satisfied sense of a secret care, Whilst squirrels were sporting and thrushes sung, And the old folks whisper'd and gossip'd together, Each one snug in an easy-chair, And murmur'd low, “Beware, beware! Not a word of this, lest the child should hear;” Heart of my heart! it was good to be young! IV. Good ships have founder'd the whole world over, For the sea is a grave, and some hearts are sore For stately ship and for sailor-lover That never again come back to the shore. But the maid is a bride, and the bride a mother (Bud, and blossom, and blown-out flower), And the new-born lives, one after another, Are a-dance, like motes, in the sunlit hour; But the two arm-chairs stand there as witness, Though the babes and the sucklings clamber and crow: “'Tis the nature of all things in their fitness— They were both of them old, it was time they should go!” V. But we—we are young, we have time to linger By pleasant pathways from Yule to June, So never heed Time, with his warning finger And shifting glass, for it is but noon! So pipe and sing to a blithesome tune, Though it be as the song of the wandering singer, Who loiters awhile, but who does not stay; Or the fatal vow of the faithless lover, Who loves, and kisses, and rides away; Or the notes of the nightingale trilling in May, Or the chirp of the grasshopper hid in the clover, That wists not when they will mow the hay, Nor knows when the nightingale's singing is over. VI. Yet were it well that these should know? A sorry world if all were wise— If all life's finger-posts were plain, And all the blind could find their eyes To see that Wisdom's self is vain! Nay, let the hour unchallenged go, For wisdom cometh unaware, When, coy at first, as violet hidden, Or guest, unto the feast unbidden, Death's messenger, the silver hair, Glistens alike in brown and gold. Alas, my friend, are the sands so low? Alas, my love, it is even so! . . . And can it be that we too are old? VII. Yea, sit we down in the old folks' chair, And watch we the little ones crow and clamber; We have woven yew-garlands for sunny hair, And put out the lights in the bridal chamber; And hand in hand, and with dimming eyes Wait we, and watch in the dusk together, O love, my love of the summer weather, Heart of my heart, who wert once so fair! No more of toiling, no more of spinning, No more heart-beatings, no more surprise; For the end is foreseen from the first beginning, The castle is fall'n ere its turrets rise— Ah, love, my love, it is sad to be wise! VIII. But Time, our master, stands wing'd and hoary, And seeming to smile as he whets his blade; Whilst Love is whisp'ring the same old story, And Hope seems shrinking and half afraid; For of these the measure of youth is made, And the measure of pleasure, the measure of glory Which is meted out to a human lot, And so on to the end (and the end draws nearer), When our souls may be freer, our senses clearer ('Tis an old world creed which is nigh forgot), When the eyes of the sleepers may waken in wonder, And the hearts may be join'd that were riven asunder, And Time and Love shall be merged—in what? AFTERWARDS. I know that these poor rags of womanhood,— This oaten pipe, whereon the wild winds play'd, Making sad music,—tatter'd and outfray'd, Cast off, play'd out,—can hold no more of good, Of love, or song, or sense of sun and shade. What homely neighbours elbow me (hard by 'Neath the black yews) I know I shall not know, Nor take account of changing winds that blow, Shifting the golden arrow, set on high On the grey spire, nor mark who come and go. Yet would I lie in some familiar place, Nor share my rest with uncongenial dead,— Somewhere, maybe, where friendly feet will tread,— As if from out some little chink of space, Mine eyes might see them tripping overhead. And though too sweet to deck a sepulchre Seem twinkling daisy-buds, and meadow grass; And so, would more than serve me, lest they pass Who fain would know what woman rested there, What her demeanour, or her story was,— For these I would that on a sculptured stone (Fenced round with ironwork to keep secure), Should sleep a form with folded palms demure, In aspect like the dreamer that was gone, With these words carved, “I hoped, but was not sure.” 1889 THE SCARAB. (DEDICATION.) You brought me once, from a distant land, A sacred scarab, 'graven o'er With mystic characters,—It bore (You said, and turn'd it in your hand,) A chapter from the Book of Death, That oldest of all books,—which saith: “Oh, my heart, that camest to me from my mother! My heart that camest to me at my birth,— That throbb'd within me whilst I dwelt on Earth And took my pastime amongst living men;— Rise not up against me now, and as a foe Before Osiris the changeless, and those other Divinest Rulers of the plaited beard, For pow'r of sceptre praised and fear'd,— Bear witness against one that was thy brother When thou and I, together, used to go And take our pastime amongst living men!” And then you told how,—where the Nile winds thro' Its fertile fields to dunes of shifting sand,— And where the ev'ning light makes blue The low hills of the Libyan land, There,—hidden in the mountain's core,— Approach'd by labyrinthian ways,— Vast chambers,—where the dead once more Were seen of men,—their walls upraise— The flickering torch's fitful flame Illuminates the haunted shade,— The lotus-budded colonnade Of blended stalks,—the sculptured name Set forth, in hieroglyphic sign, Beneath the pictured vulture-wings, Where once,—sole monarchs of the mine, Reposed those old Egyptian Kings. So long ago,—So long ago, They lived, and breathed, and held their sway, We scarcely seem to know, to-day, If they were gods or men! And that last Queen,—who, erst, unstrung And drank off the pearl to her Roman lover,— They were so old when she was young, Maybe she hardly could discover Their names and stories then! Yet is it given to us to know And read their lineaments;—to see The fringèd lid,—the beetling brow, The air of majesty. The deft embalmer's subtle skill Hath baulk'd the worm, and turn'd the grave Into these regal halls, where still From pedestal to architrave The dead men's glorious deeds survive! . . . Here their triumphant chariots drive To certain victory, and crush The vanquish'd 'neath their wheels,—whilst hither Still doth the swarthy Ethiop bring, On bended knee, his offering, The tribute of the “Land of Cush” In ivory, gold, and ostrich-feather. Here feast they,—as they did of old, Exalted on their thrones of State,— The cup-bearers, with cups of gold, The fan-bearers, and minstrels wait To serve them as they sit at meat;— Hard by, the light-foot damsels stand,— All starry-eyed, and fair of face,— The hawk-head god is close at hand, The symbol of their Royal race, The lotus blossoms at their feet; But all is silence! . . . Countless years have roll'd Since their last shout of battle died away, Still'd is the clashing of their arms for aye, Voiceless the singers,—mute the harps of gold! . . . Thus the departed rulers of the land Reposed in noiseless solitude, and slept Untroubled,—save when the lithe serpent crept At parched Midsummer, o'er the whispering sand, To take his rest among the Kingly throng, Or when,—at sunset,—from the fretted roof The great bats flutter'd;—but no sounds of Earth Heaving in travail, or in transient mirth Disturb'd their rest,—no creak of strain'd shadóof Nor burial wail, nor boatman's evening song. And here it was that, in the hollow breast Of a dead Pharaoh,—seal'd to pulseless calm, In bitumen and aromatic balm, My scarabæus had his hidden nest And waited patiently the promised end. It was his sacred privilege to plead With the high Gods for the offending heart That once had beat there, and thus play the part Of Mediator in its hour of need, Standing the dead man's advocate and friend. For, ah, what smould'ring passions may have lain Beneath this scarab, or in loosen'd fires Burst forth to waste and ravage! . . . Wild desires, With pride of State, and lust of conquer'd gain! . . . For these he might have pleaded,—not in vain, But, as it chanced,—from the barbaric North In some remote, iconoclastic, age, The spoiler came, who (with his Embassage All unachieved,) dragged the poor scarab forth Into a world where all his gods were slain. Oh hapless scarab, that in days gone by Wert wont to lie In those high halls of ancient sepulture Nestling, secure, In the still'd chamber of a monarch's breast, By his supreme behest Accredited to gods that haunt no more Old Nile's degenerate shore, Since the invading desecrator came With sword and flame, The ravisher of tombs,—and changed thy fate, How art thou fallen from thine high estate! I take thee,—unresisting,—in my hand;— A lumpish thing, wrought out of sea-grey stone,— Conventional;—no beetle that on land Or sea, or river, ever yet was known! Thou mightest be a tortoise,—by thy size,— Thy wings are scored like the eternal hills;— Thou seem'st to me superlatively wise And old, and staid, and numb to earthly ills! Yet, as becomes an Envoy of great Kings To greater gods,—a consequential air Seems to possess thee, as thy fluted wings Fold down above the mummied Pharaohs' pray'r. How art thou fallen from thine high estate “Alas, poor scarab!” I exclaim once more,— Sold into bondage on this Wintry shore, Serving in exile as a paper-weight! But what, mayhap, he wist not, when he came To do this penal service, and in shame, Humiliation, and dissembled wrath, To perch upon, and press, from dawn to dark, The written scroll,—wherein each crabbèd mark Was fraught with mystery;—she that did possess And mould him to her will,—his task-mistress,— Was a disciple of the learnèd Thoth The god of Letters. In the solitude Of her barbaric chamber,—ere she wooed The stuff'd and bloated head-rest of the North, The ancient Egyptians reposed upon a wooden rest or head-stool. She from her pointed grey goose-quill, pour'd forth At that lone midnight hour, an inky wave Of inspiration on the virgin page, Whereon she used to set her scarab slave, Then seek her couch. As, thus, his vassalage Thro' days and nights continued,—(being wise With wisdow of the Ages, and discreet Even beyond his years,) the mysteries Wherewith his new existence seem'd replete Stood forth reveal'd, and when he took his seat Upon the summit of his paper throne,— (So she believes who claims him as her own,) He could mark, learn, and inwardly digest Each garner'd thought, and, haply, recognise Some of those passions that, in Pharaoh's breast His mission 'twas to plead for;—Wild desires Smould'ring unstifled, with intent to prize The gift before the Giver, and his due Wrest from the Lord of All,—with loosen'd fires Of envy,—hatred,—vain imaginings And vainer loves! Those old things, ever new, That have survived all Egypt's gods and Kings! “Oh, my heart, that camest to me from my mother!” . . . My erring human heart, that, as a foe May rise against me! If the scarab's pray'r Savours too much of gods we have outgrown, To soar aloft through that sublimer air Which separates us from the Eternal Throne, May it, at least, prove pure enough to go And plead for me on Earth with Man, my brother! So, when to you,—the truest and the best Of all surviving friends,—I dedicate The wand'ring fancies that were lately press'd By this,—your gift,—grown up into a book For your acceptance;—that your eyes may look With more indulgence on the thoughts express'd So faultily,—my sacred paper-weight I set upon the cover,—like a crest, With its pathetic pray'r inviolate. LIFE'S AFTERNOON. I sit at rest, and in Life's Afternoon, Look back in pitying wonder, at its dawn And fierce meridian heat,—whilst all too soon The ev'ning shadows lengthen on the lawn, And ere yon pink glow leaves the Western sky To-day is number'd with the days gone by. How did I strive and struggle in the sun, In the hot noontide of those ardent years! . . . What rash encounters, then, were lost and won Wherein my heart's blood mingled with my tears! . . . Tears that are dried,—blood that has ceased to flow, Few are the shafts could strike to wound me now! All things have changed of late;—I know the gold For what it is, and fling aside the dross,— Few are the treasures that I care to hold, And fewer those whereof I mourn the loss,— I can forgive and pity, tho' I look In a false face and read it like a book. Ah, me! for time and strength to make amends For all that ardour, anger,—fond belief! . . . To reap the meed of scorning paltry ends, To glean in Wisdom's fields and bind the sheaf, Nor feel afraid that I may be bereft Of e'en this doubtful daylight that is left! Methinks I know the life that I should choose To live again, could I but have a voice In mine own destiny, nor would I use The boon so lightly as to rue my choice, Since all the errors I could ne'er forget Should seem like danger-signals ready set. I would not be a rover, and so waste In small-change moments, such a golden prize But husbanding the seasons without haste Would leave myself full leisure to grow wise,— And, knowing how delusive all things prove, I would not strive or envy,—hate or love. For, in the rays of that enlighten'd day Mine eyes should see things truly as they are,— The golden idol, with the feet of clay, The glow-worm that I took to be a star,— Nor would I bow at any earthly shrine Since God, and God alone, should be divine. I would remember that the desert sands Efface their traces that have pass'd before, And that the freshest footprint only stands Till newer whirlwinds shall have swept it o'er, So, with the victor's crown,—the poet's bays, New heroes rise,—new minstrels sing new lays. And, were I prone to envy rosier blush, Or brighter glance, or sunnier locks, than mine, I would remember Beauty is no bush Set up to tempt the traveller to good wine;— That jewell'd cup hath oft held poison'd draught Beguiling unto death the lips that quaffed. Yet would I dwell by pleasant, leafy ways, Where Nature's aspect should, at least, beam fair, Where peaceful nights should follow pensive days Purged of all passion and exempt from care,— My pleasures simple,—my requirements few, My part,—to ponder,—rather than to do. A garden and a sundial,—but its face Should be with blinding clematis o'errun, So that the eye no envious line should trace To warn of when the tranquil day was done,— And sloping lawns, and tinkling silver brooks, One chosen friend, perhaps, and favourite books. . . . Ah voice of Wisdom, vainer than the fool's! Dull, joyless, echo of a vanish'd tune! Who would not give the frosts of fifty Yules For one brief season warm'd with Love and June! Said I my heart was dead? . . . I spake untrue;— Ah, Love! it lives, and beats, and beats for you! What soul could soar once human hopes were brought To this low level of contemptuous scorn? What cruse of oil would feed the Lamp of Thought, What frolic fancies animate the morn? . . . How would such passionless perfection rise Above the bigot's pictured Paradise? . . . The fruits of Wisdom make a mawkish feast Since sweet and bitter are our nature's due;— Come back,—young lover! to my lonely breast And tho' I know you false, I'll dream you true! Hail dear delusions! welcome hopes and fears! Come storm and sunshine, fraught with smiles and tears! I sit at rest and Autumn-time is here! . . . Her first red leaf lies quivering at my feet,— “At rest,”—not yet at peace! Oh, hurrying year! Oh, Youth, and Summer, that were once so sweet, Ere I renounce you,—with your joys and woes,— I must await the numbing Winter snows! A few swift days,—scarce time to close the door Against the blast, or draw the easy chair Towards the glowing hearth, and Winter hoar Will chill our blood, and sweep our branches bare, And even thus the Winter of our days Shall numb our senses and obscure our gaze. But now? . . . Has all the sun-glow left the skies? . . . Is ev'ry songster silent in the grove? . . . Despite the dreary warnings of the wise, May I not sing of Summer-time and Love? “Surely,”—(soft voices whisper in my ear), “Both will return to you again next year?” Delusive whispers! . . . Ah, perfidious time In which each varied season hath a part,— When Winter's frosts are withering our prime Whilst Summer sunsets flicker in the heart,— When Age's Wisdom links with Youth's Desire And placid brow belies a breast of fire! How shall a minstrel wake the trembling lyre And sing of Love, in Autumn-time, and live? . . . Yet cold the verse that lacks the sacred fire Which Hope, and Youth, and Love, alone can give! I strike the lyre; the answering echoes ring:— Say, oh, my Friend! is it too late to sing? . . . Nay! for in serer Autumns have I seen Some slim brown bird start up upon a spray And warble as tho' all the world were green And chill October blossoming like May,— Yet droops the rose, and howso' sweet the song Nor bird nor minstrel may rejoice for long! CONTRASTS. A SONG OF THE WIND. “A venturesome fellow is the Wind: creeping thro' the keyholes and crannies of a house, he must wot of strange contrasts.” With their heads on the self-same pillow A bride and a bridegroom kiss'd, But the Wind is a venturesome fellow Who sings: “I can roam where I list:— “I can creep,—I can crouch,—I can clamber,” And he whispers, now, soft, overhead, “Stretch'd out in the very next chamber Lies a corpse all alone on the bed.” TWO PICTURES. I. LOVERS IN A GARDEN. II. A WIDOW KNITTING BY AN EMPTY CRADLE. I. A maiden, in a garden, dreaming Of fairy-prince and halcyon days; Her head, with sunny tresses gleaming, Bow'd down beneath dim trellis'd ways; A row of sunflow'rs by a paling, A wicket left upon the latch, A summer-house, with woodbine trailing, And ivy creeping o'er the thatch. A footfall on the garden gravel, A quick'ning heart, a whisper'd word; A youth, burnt brown with foreign travel, Come back to claim a hope deferr'd. (O happy, happy time of Love's beginning, Ere ever we can guess that storms are near Sunlight glancing, buds unfolding, thrushes singing, Golden Summer of the soul and of the year!) II. A garret in a city byway, A pale sad woman all alone; A weary wand'rer on Life's highway, Poor and forsaken and unknown. What need to knit the little stocking, Or strive again for daily bread? Why set an empty cradle rocking? The nestling has for ever fled! “Yes, both are gone; perchance 'tis better!” She sighs at length. “'Tis better so!” Then bends to read a tatter'd letter, Or turns to watch the falling snow. (Ah, bitter, bitter time of Sorrow's waking, Ere ever we can dream that hope is near! Snow is falling, flow'rs are fading, hearts are breaking, Weary Winter of the soul and of the year!) VICTORIA. 21st June 1887. Queen of so many nations that the sun Sets not upon the boundaries of thy sway,— Whom men of varied clime and creed obey,— Mother of many Princes,—wife of one Who,—now these fleet-foot fifty years are run Whereof the festival is held to-day,— Sees not thy golden tresses turn'd to grey, But,—in eternal slumber, slumbers on;— How many glorious images unite 'Round thine illustrious name!—The Dragon's head Beneath St. George's heel:—the Lion's might:— Britannia:—India's Empress,—robed in red, Crown'd and enthroned!—Then lo! thou com'st in sight,— A lonely woman,—sable garmented. LINES UPON A STATUETTE REPRESENTING LOVE AND DEATH. Time was, mine eyes were pleased with this conceit;— A little god in bronze,—with gilded wings,— His dart already poised, and, at his feet, A grinning skull, o'errun with creeping things. And, strewn around, trite emblem and curl'd scroll,— Telling of transient joy and fleeting breath, Time's hour-glass lying by the festive bowl, Love's empty quiver by the scythe of Death. Ah, whilst the bowl was crown'd,—the quiver full, Love's fingers feeling for the fateful shaft,— Careless of gleaming scythe, or grinning skull, Along the “primrose path” we kiss'd and quaff'd! Oh, for one draught from that enchanted spring! . . . One honest wound from that uplifted dart! Oh, for some new,—some unexpected thing, Wise tho' we be,—to make us fools at heart! We want not Wisdom now; we grow too wise— Smite us, dear Love! we'll glory in the scar! Yea, press thy bandage closer to our eyes, So that we know things not for what they are! Why hearken, now, to such an oft-told tale? . . . In the calm twilight of our Autumn days Were it not best that pious hands should veil All sombre symbols from our sadden'd gaze? So that we see but half this grim conceit;— A little god in bronze, with gilded wings,— His dart all ready poised, but, at his feet, Nor hour-glass, scythe, nor skull with creeping things! THE MER-BABY. (SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE BY MISS DOROTHY TENNANT. Now Mrs. H. M. Stanley.) They wander'd forth,—link'd hand in hand, To watch their father's speeding sail, When lo! they saw it on the sand, A mer-baby, with folded tail,— A mer-baby,—all pale and dead,— Left stranded by the ebbing tides,— With sea-weeds wreathed about its head, And silver fins upon its sides. They strove by many an artless wile To wake it up and make it play,— The wan sea-baby would not smile,— All cold and motionless it lay. Its eyes were closed as tho' in sleep, Its fingers clasp'd as tho' in pray'r,— The little land-babes could but weep To see it lying lonely there! Then out and spake the elder one,— (His eyes as azure as the wave,) “We will not leave it here alone, But make for it a pretty grave “Near where our little sisters sleep, Hard by the hedge where violets grow, Where mother often goes to weep And mind her children in a row.” They took it to their mother dear,— She loved not mer-folk over well, For she had heard those tales of fear The deep-sea fishers have to tell; And well she knew that bleaching skulls Lie hidden in the changeful main, 'Neath where the syren lures and lulls The mariner with dulcet strain;— This, ay, and more, the mother knew,— Yet, when she saw a thing so fair With folded tail,—all silver-blue, And fingers clasp'd as tho' in pray'r, She made for it a pretty bed,— All velvet-soft with gather'd moss, And set a sea-shell at its head Because she dared not set a cross,— Near where her little daughters slept, Hard by the hedge where violets grow,— Where, often times, she went, and wept To see their green graves in a row. And, “Heaven grant, my babes,” said she, “If father sinks beneath the wave, The fish-tail'd people of the sea May make for him as soft a grave.” THE LAMENT OF A WHITE ROSE. I grew beside a garden seat, Where happy children laugh'd and play'd, And tender lovers—dreaming—stray'd, Whilst all my budding breast was sweet; (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) Anon, the children's mirth was o'er, The tender lovers clung and wept; Within the house a mother slept Her last long sleep, to wake no more; (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) They came and cull'd a fun'ral wreath, They pluck'd the white, they spared the red, They flung me on a straiten'd bed On her cold breast who lay in death. (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) They mourn'd and sigh'd in bow'r and hall, The children cried, the lovers clung; A great bell toll'd with solemn tongue, The coffin-lid leant by the wall; (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) They lifted up the coffin-lid, Strange footsteps echo'd on the stair, Her children came to see her there, And kiss her ere her face was hid; (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) They wept in hall, they wept in bow'r, Their tears fell o'er me as they kiss'd her, But the red rose weeps for her own pale sister Buried alive 'neath the grey church tow'r. (Oh, why was I only a poor white rose!) A CHANCE LIKENESS. Sometimes it happens,—in Life's Afternoon, We see a passing face like one we knew At Youth's beginning, when each pulse beat high With hope and joy in living. From the crowd,— The careless crowd,—that might not understand That a lost love can light a living face,— How do we long to welcome such a one,— To call him to our side, to clasp his hand, And greet him as a friend! . . With yearning eyes We seek his own, expectant of the smile Of recognition . . . Ah! . he knows us not! . . . The sacred symbols,—like a hollow mask Portraying one we loved, are set to-day Upon a stranger's brow! . . The lips are mute,— The eyes perceive us not,—no kindly word Falls to our share,—with hunger in our gaze We see the phantom fade, and stand forlorn, A sad survivor! . . God, and our own hearts Know all we miss on earth! . . CLARA. (AGED SEVENTEEN.) Watching the summer swallows flit and pass, My Clara,—grown a lissome nut-brown maid, Stands dreaming 'midst the daisied meadow-grass In her own youth and innocence array'd;— She cares not for the city's noise and glare,— A country girl, in pleasant places bred,— Fenced round from outward harm by tender care, Peace in her heart and sunshine o'er her head. Yet, sometimes,—as I watch her standing thus, I ask myself, half-sadly: Where is she,— That other Clara,—who was once with us,— Whose head could scarcely reach above my knee? . . . I seek her in the shady orchard walk,— I miss her pattering footsteps on the floor,— Yet hear the echo of her baby-talk, And read her height upon the nursery door. No curly head comes to the window-sill As once,—responsive to my loving call,— Tho' there the painted bars are fasten'd still That saved the pretty nestling from a fall;— But, thro' them, somehow,—little Clara fled,— And, every day, I mark, with new surprise, The stately maiden, sent me in her stead With pensive mien and earnest waiting eyes,— A woman grown, and nursing in her breast Haply,—a thousand fond imaginings,— Her wings all ready plumed to leave the nest, Her fancy eager to outstrip her wings. So do the changing Seasons glide away Under the calm unalterable stars,— And e'en to me, it seems but yesterday When I, too, look'd at Life thro' nursery-bars! HAZELY HEATH. 'Tis “chill October,” yet the linnet sings,— Still are our brows with balmy breezes fann'd;— No Winter makes a desert of this land Of my adoption, where each season brings To charm the sense,—new guerdon of good things, And Autumn only spreads with tender hand A richer mantle o'er the billowy sand, Golden and purple,—braver than a King's. Here all is light and song, with odorous breath Of briar and pine,—whilst ever, early and late, The yellow gorse,—like “kissing-time,” or Death, Abides with us. It were a worthier fate To crawl,—methinks,—a worm,—on Hazely Heath, Than strut,—a peacock,—at a Palace gate! SOUVENIR. (WRITTEN IN A BOOK.) I see the spot, in fancy, where we read This book together, 'neath a Southern sky;— A mighty chestnut towers overhead And shades us from the sun,—beneath us lie Fair fields, and flowering meads, and orchards trim, And then, the little town, where, here and there, Seeming no bigger than the flies that skim Yon tinkling Alpine stream, by Inn and Square, Flit men and women,—strangers, and unknown To you and me, who, from our Northern Isle Like two stray skiffs, by shifting tempests blown, Have reach'd this quiet haven, where the smile Of Nature greets us, and the skies are fair And hopeful as my heart! . . . Thro' branch and bine Of trailing clematis, the fragrant air Comes laden with soft sound and sweetest scent, Thrilling the trembling fox-glove and young vine As with a sigh of pleasure and content Such as I feel at last! . . . Here, as we rest On the fell'd trunk of some such giant tree As that which shades us, in my grateful breast What dreams arise of sweet tranquillity,— Of Home,—of Love! . . A life when every day Might be as this one, when the happy night Would join instead of parting, and the way To surer rest, should seem so swift a flight Our souls might make this comfort of sad hearts Their only haunting terror! . . Then, you read From this same book, wherein, it seem'd, in parts,— (Spoken by that dear voice which, were I dead Methinks would wake me,)—thoughts that had been mine An unknown poet sang;—of true-love crown'd,— Of grief for true-love's loss;—of Life's decline To peaceful Autumn, when green leaves are brown'd And brown locks silver'd;—And, the while you read You held my hand, and leagues of land and sea Seem'd spread between me and each anxious dread, Whilst all the world seem'd fair,—since you,—to me, Were all the world! . . . AN EGOTIST'S CREED. Lost in a maze of idle thought This world to me so perfect seems,— So bright and light with glancing beams And pleasant pastures, flower-fraught, 'Tis as the heaven of my dreams;— And if my feet could always stroll Along the sweet familiar ways, I would not change this earthly phase Of Life and Love, for all the soul May gain in promised lands of praise. In vain, for me, the preacher raves, Exulting in his narrow creed,— The sinner's doom,—the good man's meed,— In yon grey pile amongst the graves I lend no ear, and take no heed;— For, can the Giver of all good, To further some prepost'rous plan, Have made, in enmity to man, So fair a world,—in wrathful mood Turning a blessing to a ban? Nay, tho' I know that millions pine, And see the maim'd, the halt, the blind,— The pallid forms that sweat and grind And toil at furnace, mill, and mine, Yet will I deem Him just and kind. “Ay, ‘just and kind’! Ay, ‘kind and just’!” (Harsh mocking voices seem to say), “To thrust us forth,—to our dismay The brood of drunkenness and lust, Where all, save we, keep holiday! “For us no shade of summer trees, No sight of daisy-spangled sward,— We, the accursèd of the Lord, Must toil for you who sit at ease, Disease and Death our sole reward! “Can our crush'd hearts ascend in pray'r,— Our woeful accents hymn the praise Of that stern Pow'r that smites and slays His creatures, when too weak to bear Their burden of disast'rous days? “And dread ye not,—who sit and weave Sweet, idle fancies, at your will, Who grasp the good, and spurn the ill,— That sky may fall, or earth upheave, Or some swift bolt avenge us still?” . . . These voices somewhat mar my rest, . . . Well, well! We know not what is plann'd! . . . Some must be wretched in the land,— All things are order'd for the best, And more, we may not understand! So, whilst,—for me,—the world is bright, Whilst skies are blue, and fields are fair, Need I the ills of others share? My gladness gives them no delight, Shall I lament for their despair? AN EQUINOCTIAL GALE. To-night the winds of Heav'n are all unbound And sweep, with angry breath, the Autumn glade, And as I, waking,—listen to the sound, My spirit falters, and I feel afraid. Knowing how small a planet is our World,— Poised, like a bubble, in Eternal Space, One well might wonder that it is not hurl'd This ev'ning, from its old appointed place; But, as the little emmet, that has borne Some fancied treasure to his fairy hill, Fears not for cities wreck'd, or forests torn, So he can cling to what he toil'd for still;— So, since this battling of the winds began, My heart has sought thee on the raging main, Tho', in the mighty universal plan, My pearl is even as the emmet's grain! ON CHRISTMAS-EVE. On Christmas-eve—(How long ago? I muse, yet cannot count the score)— She, shrouded in her mantle, so— (It must be twenty years or more)— Went weeping through yon curtain'd door, Into the softly falling snow. She had said mad unmeaning things; Had knelt to me, and clasp'd my knees; Call'd up the ghosts of vanish'd springs, And kisses under summer trees, Deeming the memory of these Would hinder Love's unfetter'd wings. She spoke of fealty giv'n in vain, Of pledge and promise writ on sand, Of past delights and present pain, With more I did not understand; Then drew my ring from off her hand, And thrust it back on me again. That ring (my lady wears it now) She used to call her wedding-ring,— A crown, with heart-shaped pearl below (My heart, she said, poor little thing!) What profits it remembering? It is but foolishness, I know. She cursed me, kneeling at my feet (Not that such curses aught avail!); Then, changing swift from sad to sweet, She kiss'd me through her tear-stain'd veil; Then rose, prophetical and pale, And, e'er she sought the silent street, “If the dead ever rise,” she said,— “The dead that did not wait to die,— Then, maybe, after you are wed To one more fortunate than I, On some such ev'ning, by and by, You'll see me standing by your bed.” The deerhound crouching at my side Whined low, and seem'd to understand; All movement in the street had died, I knew the snow lay soft as sand; I saw the clock, with straighten'd hand Like index-finger raised to chide. Half after twelve! And, as to-night, I sat here, dozing all alone, I woke to start at something white, That whisper'd in an undertone, Whilst all around a glory shone— (It must have been some trick of light). There seem'd a sound of surging tide, A voice as from a wat'ry grave; And then, a figure like a bride, With tresses floating on the wave, Cried out to me to help and save— (I wonder how and when she died!). And then I look'd, and lo! the clock Stood at the hour, the hands were there,— Half after twelve! A shiv'ring shock, A sense of wringing clinging hair, A flutt'ring footfall on the stair, And then—Stay! there's my lady's knock. Her rating wifely tones I hear— (Her voice is somewhat shrill and high;) Her trailing silks come rustling near (No one can dress like Lady Di.)— Ghosts of the bygone years, good-bye!— “A merry Christmas to you, dear!” WRITTEN IN A VOLUME OF “THE WORKS OF SHENSTONE,” Which had belonged to Lord Byron when a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in which the Poet had inscribed some laudatory remarks concerning the Author. “By Poet written, and by Poet read, A twofold glory shines upon my head;— Perish'd the eyes that read,—the hand that wrote,— Tatter'd and travel-stained my russet coat,— Yet still I live to Fame!—In living eyes, To living hands,—a treasure and a prize,— Lord Byron's book! . . . Ere yet the accomplished days Had wreathed his forehead with immortal bays, Whilst the Promethean spark, to Fame unknown, Smoulder'd beneath an Academic gown, Byron! I was thine own!—oft laid to rest, Rock'd by the throb of thine impetuous breast, Clasp'd by thy hand,—commended by thy pen Ere yet thou had'st thy place with gods or men! “Illustrious Master! thy brief race is run,— Whilst chill'd by Winter,—warm'd by Summer sun,— The pen that praised me evermore at rest, I bide with mortals still, a favour'd guest! . . . Ah! had Death claim'd thee 'ere thy genius reign'd, Fame had been cheated of what Honour gain'd;— Silent the voice of thine immortal song, Silent the carpings of the spiteful throng,— Untraced pain's record on thine uncrown'd brow, Unmoved the million hearts that love thee now!— And I,—this humble thing of prose and rhyme,— Thy friend and servant of a vanish'd time, Had been but ‘Works of Shenstone,’ badly bound, Nor cost my present mistress twenty pound!’ A FABLE. Digging amongst my turnips, one fine day, I spied, as I upheaved, a clod of clay, A lithe red worm—the gard'ner's special dread— Coil'd round a promising young turnip-head. “Ah, noisome reptile, thus thy greed is foil'd!” I cried, and would have crush'd him as he coil'd, When, lo! methought, this worm of aspect meek Turn'd, and tho' counted speechless, seem'd to speak;— “Forbear, rash fool!” (it proudly said) “nor deem My tastes as vegetarian as they seem, But, . . . I am blind! . . . and groping here, to-day, A large round object barr'd me in my way,— 'Twas but thy turnip! not the thing I sought,— The Seat of Fancy, and the Throne of Thought! Enjoy it whilst thou may'st, in upper air, Whilst I, in darkness, seek for daintier fare. Patience, in time, shall sure fruition bring:— My grandfather once feasted on a king!” SONG. “I WONDER WILL YOU TWINE FOR ME,” &amp;c. “Dark tree! still sad when others' grief is fled,— The only constant mourner o'er the dead!” —Byron. I wonder,—will you twine for me Sad cypress wreaths when I am dead, Or, sentinel,—like yon dark tree, Watch, constant, o'er my lonely bed? Or will you,—like some forest bird Escaped the slumb'ring fowler's snare, Plume your free'd wings, and heavenward Soar blithely thro' the ambient air? . . . Methinks at both my heart would bleed,— My spirit-heart, 'neath folded wings,— If our poor sexless souls shall heed The passing of terrestrial things! So, choose, my love, some middle way;— At morn,—like falcon fresh and free Soar sunwards,—but, at closing day Be, sometimes, like the cypress tree;— Mute o'er a memory remain In centred thought, one little minute,— Unclasp one closed-up book again, And read the story written in it! SNOW AT CHRISTMAS. Snowflakes on laden bough and whiten'd ledge; Poor Robin Redbreast chirping for his crumbs; Imprison'd waters under drooping sedge; Sad children, carolling in cold that numbs And hangs the icicles upon the spray, Paling green fields, and making skies as dun And veil'd as Destiny! . . . Thus Christmas comes Girt with the well-worn symbols, whilst away From off the far horizon's utmost edge His semblance fades, before a rising sun, Who turn'd the season to a holiday! “SHE WILL NOT WAKE!” I. “If it should chance, upon some future day, You hear them say Haply, that I am lain asleep in death, Close to my breath (Coming so quietly that none may know) Lay your lips so . . . Kiss and conjure me, thus, . . . till I awake, And men shall marvel that they call'd me dead, Seeing me lean toward you from my bed. This for my sake!” Thus spake my love, and kiss'd me as she spake. II. My love spake thus to me in midwinter; I, chiding her, Talk'd of long summer days, blossoms on bough, Sunlight aglow, Woods wide awake with echo of sweet song, And all day long Very delight at living life so fair, And, straining her towards me in my arms, Strove with light words to silence her alarms, Smooth'd her soft hair, And blamed her thoughts, seeing so sad they were. III. But, well-a-day! the winter overpass'd, Spring came at last, Flow'rs under foot and birds upon the boughs;— From out the house Her women came, with haggard looks, and said, “Your love is dead! Strewn round with garden-lilies all as fair, Come and behold her where she lies asleep.” Then I, too sick in spirit e'en to weep For my despair, Pass'd up into the house and saw her there. IV. Crown'd with just such a wreath as one I made When, 'neath the shade, We sat in summer-time breast high in fern, Beside the burn, With all life seeming moulded to our will— So cold, so still, I had not even kiss'd her out of fear; Yet, for acquittal of my promise' sake, And for her own, that she would straightway wake, I then and there Bent down my falt'ring lips to kiss my dear. V. “Ah, wake to me!” I cried, “my love, my life! More than my wife! Dearer than waking love of living man!” And I began (Bearing in memory her fond request) From her cold breast To thrust aside white lilies and green yew Kissing and calling her—“Awake, awake! Awake, my darling, for your promise' sake, Made whilst your lips were warm!” 'Twas then I knew Her words untrue: Kiss howsoe'er I might, she would not wake. She will not wake—ah me, she will not wake! A MAY MEETING. The same gold gorse, and the same brown heather, And the same shrill note of the plover's cry, And the same curl'd cloud like an angel's feather, Afloat in the midst of an amber sky, And away to the westward, the same sun setting, Midst the cloudland castles that nobody owns,— And the same little stream that goes foaming, fretting, To seaward, over the self-same stones, And the same old mansion, its casements burning Aglow with the sun's last lingering rays, And over the fir-tree top, at the turning, The first bright star of those last bright days! Curly brown locks and golden tresses, A youth and a maiden fair to see, With whispering words and stol'n caresses, And the hope in their hearts of a bliss to be. The nightingale hush'd, May turned to December, Locks and tresses alike grown gray,— One to forget and one to remember, And each to travel a different way. Then, the same gold gorse and the same brown heather, And the same little streamlet bound for the sea; And the two that have met and talk'd together; Alas for the changes in you and me! THE GUEST-CHAMBER. With bated breath, and falt'ring feet, I tread The threshold of this room, and ever so Must enter it! The cheerful fire-light glow Falls softly on the rosy-curtain'd bed Made ready for the guest;—the table spread With snowy muslin, and with flow'rs that blow And, e'en in this chill month, their fragrance shed,— And all seems bright, to those who do not know! But I am looking,—with mine inward eyes,— Upon another sight;—the self-same room Shrouded and darken'd, and a form that lies Straighten'd upon the bed,—the seal of doom For ever on her lips;—I hear low sighs And smell sweet blossoms destined for a tomb. THE RETURN OF THE BELOVED. He is under this roof to-night,—he is home,—he is safe,—he is well! So the eyes that were watching may slumber,—the listening ears be at rest, All my soul seems to rise and rejoice to the chime of a marriage bell, And the heart that was turn'd to a stone, is as blithe as a bird in my breast! How oft,—when the storm-cloud has darken'd,—the tempest beat loud at the pane, Have I said to my faltering heart, “Is it well with my love on his way? . . . Is he braving the fury of waves, or the withering suns of the plain, Or the treacherous tongues that deceive, or the eyes that may lead him astray?” And so,—as the days dragg'd along, was I torn and tormented with doubt,— Whilst a pall lay all over the land, and the sun seem'd obscured in the sky, Forlorn and distress'd and unquiet,—by daylight I wander'd about, Forlorn and distress'd and unquiet,—I watch'd the long nights go by;— Afraid to feel careless of spirit, or fill up my life to the brim With the laughter that drowns all thought, or the labour that leads to repose, Lest the moments that lighten'd my pain might be fraught with misfortune for him,— “I can bear with the Winter,” (I said), “if the sun will but shine at its close.” But now,—he is home, he is here! . . . I thank God he is safe, he is well! Now the slowest of clocks will seem fast,—now the darkest of days will seem fine, My heart blithe as a bird in my breast,—all my soul like a marriage bell, He is under this roof to-night, he is safe,—he is well,—he is mine! FALSE OR TRUE? The woman I loved has been gone a year— (A year from my lips, a year from my breast!)— I saw her lie cold on her flow'r-strewn bier Ere they bore her away to her lonely rest. I had loved her as never man loved before, Or promised maiden, or plighted wife: I have mourn'd for her loss upon sea and shore, And known, without her, a death in life. I have miss'd her letters, her pray'rs, her tears, Her sighs, her laughter, her chiding tone, Her foolish fancies, her idle fears, And her love that seem'd all my own! I have sought for her spirit by day and night— (Oh, for a look, for a touch, for a breath, For a whisper'd word from my soul's delight To bring me life from the realms of Death!) Thus have I lived for a whole long year, But my comrades have never known aught of this, And one has just whisper'd a word in my ear, A word to give comfort, nor take amiss; “You are well, my friend, you are gay,” he said; “I am glad at heart that they told me true; I had fear'd you were mourning for one who is dead, And who should have been nothing to you.” And then he told me of how he knew— And of how he would prove to me, by and by, That the one I had loved so well was untrue, That her life had been all a lie. And I? I answer'd him never a word— I utter'd no cry, nor of rage or pain, But stood blankly staring, and meekly heard— In an hour he will come again. He will bring me proofs, in black and white, Written words in a well-feign'd hand, But I shall know how to read aright— I shall profit and understand! (Cold she lay on her flow'r-strewn bier, Cold, and quiet, and draped in white, With her hair comb'd carefully back from her ear)— Is he wrong, I wonder, or right? Here have I sat since he said his say— (A year? A day? How long ago?)— So her lips could lie, and her eyes betray? . . . In an hour I shall read and know! . . . Yet the lips in this pictured face look true, And the eyes gaze so tenderly back into mine! The lips are so red, and the eyes so blue, But mute, they can give no sign! Speak, lips that are silent! Speak, questioning eyes! Come back, light step, to the echoing stair! I have call'd to her thus till she seem'd to rise And stand in the doorway, there; And sometimes she comes as an angel Queen, Wing'd with silver and crown'd with light, With calm pure eyes, and a serious mien, In garments of dazzling white. And sometimes she comes as so oft of yore, Cloak'd, and veil'd, and quietly dress'd, And flies to my arms ere I close the door— It is thus that I love her best! Will she come to-night in her cloak and veil, Or with angel-lustre around her brow? Will she cling to my knees as a penitent pale? No matter! I know her now! I know her now, that woman who died, With her pleading voice and her earnest gaze— Her false blue eyes, and her lips that lied, And her treacherous, winning ways! . . . Yet the lips in her pictured face look true . . . Sweetest of lips that are seal'd and set! Tenderest eyes, that are closed to view— Shall my mind mistrust you, my soul forget? Cold she lay on her flow'r-strewn bier— I could not question, nor she reply; And now, when her heart has been still but a year, Shall I harden my own for a lie? Nay, Love of my life! it shall never be said When our innermost thoughts stand forth reveal'd, That,—trusting you living,—I doubted you dead When your lips were silent and seal'd! If it was as he says, and I never knew, Will knowing it now bring me better cheer? . . One heart, at least, shall beat loyal and true;— He may speak, but I will not hear! IN MEMORIAM. We are survivors; from the echoing street One more familiar footstep dies away Into eternal silence. Day by day Some eye that brighten'd, some brave heart that beat, Is closed and still'd. Alas! those hurrying feet, Where are they fled, bearing the bright array Of Wisdom, Beauty, Youth? And where are they Whose living love made life and leisure sweet? I cannot deem they are departed quite— Transfigured, changed, and vanish'd from our eyes— But living to us still, though lost to sight, And surely sharing still our smiles and sighs! A self-made creed, begot of memories, Yet, if I err, whose voice shall set me right? A HOMELESS LOVE. Poor Love is driven out, Even with scourge and knout,— What evil has he wrought to deserve so rude a waking? . . . He is exiled from the bow'rs Where he pass'd such blissful hours, And underneath his batter'd wings his little heart is breaking! In what cold lonely bed Is he to rest his head? . . . What orphanage or almshouse will take him in its keeping? . . . Ah, Love has had his day, So he must go his way;— He weeps, but none are sorry for his weeping! Play'd he not well his part? Was not his tender heart Ever faithful and brave, alike in days of joy or sorrow? In what was he remiss? Gave he not kiss for kiss? What fault of his has brought about this miserable morrow? So he had bed and board, Nor guerdon nor reward Claim'd he—as of a right, who was not arrogant or grasping, Accounting himself rich If, in some hidden niche, His heart might only beat against the treasure he was clasping. In such a narrow space Could he take up his place,— A spider's fairy web, or else a curl'd-up leaf in summer,— There would he lodge, and lie Beneath a cloudless sky, Unexpectant of rebuff from either comrade or newcomer. For, if a step drew near He would prick his watchful ear, And then nestle snug and close and give forth no sign or greeting, Holding his eager breath He would feign to lie in death, Tho' underneath his folded wings his little heart was beating! But dismal days have come And he has now no home, His very cobweb lodging is or ruin'd or bespoken, The leaf wherein he curl'd Is spread open to the world, And underneath his bleeding wings his little heart is broken! In what cold lonely bed Is he to rest his head? What orphanage or almshouse will take him in its keeping? Ah, Love has had his day, So he must go his way, He weeps, but none are sorry for his weeping! SIX SONNETS. I. CONCENTRATION. Mine has not been the lot of those who find By warm firesides the light of friendly smile, Nor can the stolèd priest in fretted aisle Soothe with his specious salves my stubborn mind; I strain not after gold with those who grind The mill of daily toil, nor care to while The absent hour with pleasures that beguile, Since home, creed, wealth, and world, in one combined. See then, my friend, how great has been my gain,— How kind sweet destiny, how wise my choice! How have I cause to triumph and rejoice Whilst all I treasure my two arms contain! Tho', should one heart grow cold, and mute one voice, My soul must languish in perpetual pain! II. LOVE'S VANITY. It is for you, dear love, I dress, and don Soft raiment, lace, and jewels of red gold, To shine in your eyes only, and to hold At the sword's point what was so dearly won.— And so, and not for self's sake,—I put on These pomps and vanities, which you behold But scarcely mark! Ah, vain and manifold Are Love's poor wiles, yet none are new,—not one! For ladies ev'n as I,—long, long ago, In some such eyes as yours to merit grace, Twined chains of shining gold, and pearls in row, And deck'd themselves in jewels and fine lace, Above whose bones, to-day, rank burdocks grow, Whilst cold winds sigh around their resting place! III. UNCERTAINTY. Doubt not the wisdom of the just Decree Which saith, “Ye shall not know: ye shall not raise The veil that shrouds the dawning of new days And new misfortunes!” Who could live, yet see The loved one's vacant place? or watch him, free,— Turning to tread, with cold averted gaze, The paths that lead from old familiar ways, And all the cruel changes that may be? . . . Nothing I know, and nothing understand,— Nor would I lift the veil, and yet, altho' Your days may prove the longest in the land, Still,—since I neither understand nor know, And cannot read the lines in this dear hand, I hold it fast,—afraid to let it go! IV. THE SLAVE TURNED TYRANT. Should you despise her for that, born to sway She serves instead; at your belovèd feet Meek and obedient, that she takes her seat, And,—as you frown or smile,—is grave or gay: A word,—a look,—can darken all her day Or make night glorious; but, as thus you mete, Conscious of might,—alternate bitter and sweet, Careless of what you do, or what you say,— Think, Master mine! not thus, in by-gone days Dared your hand smite her, or your accents check The love you craved for! Hers has been the fault Who raised her slave to sit above the salt, And so, she may not chide, but only prays For mercy,—with your heel upon her neck. V. THE VOW. You swore, and by my life, that you were true; And still I let you swear,—nor with a kiss Hush'd those dear accents, lest they might dismiss My body to its bed beneath the yew! Green fields are fair, and summer skies are blue, Yet,—so I find you false,—what profits this? How sigh in solitude for vanish'd bliss, Or know another dawn that knows not you? So, if your words were words, and nothing more, Spoken in jest, or said to satisfy The hunger of my heart,—if so you swore, And so, swore falsely, it were best to die Could your words kill! Then, say them o'er and o'er Nor let me live to languish if you lie! VI. THE VOW BROKEN. Ah, wanton words! Ah, sweetest lips forsworn! Ah, lightly spoken,—lightly broken, vow, Whose inspiration was the vehement glow Of Love's brief summer, when the rose is born! We are grown wise enough to laugh to scorn Youth's rash asseverations;—we, who know How coldly crawls the stream 'neath frost and snow That leapt so lightly on an April morn! See,—still I sojourn midst the haunts of men Despite your perfidy! Suns rise and set To warm a world that seems as fair as when We gazed on it together, and yet—and yet,— I know not, even now, without regret If I can smile at what I wept for then! MEMORIES. WRITTEN ON AN ANNIVERSARY. We should remember;—years roll on apace, But as the headlong Alpine torrent brings Down to the hoary mountain's shadowy base The drift and wreck of rare and far-off things,— An eagle's plume, maybe; a crystal gem That lurk'd, of old,—beneath eternal snows On virgin peaks;—or else some sever'd stem Of “edelweis” or cluster'd Alpine rose;— So, in our alter'd lives,—constrain'd to take Their tamer course along the level ways, Some floating memory may serve to wake The slum'bring consciousness of vanish'd days. To-day, such tribute Life's calm'd river brings From stormier heights; a crystal bright and rare; A feather from an eagle's wide-spread wings,— A flow'r that blossom'd once in purer air! A WISH. I would there were a post-office, However far away,— And whatsoever the postage was That I might have to pay, For a letter to reach my dear dead love Upon some future day! I would write it with my own heart's blood, And sprinkle it with tears, And tell him what my life had miss'd Thro' all these weary years, If my mute appeal could penetrate The music of the spheres! I would send him a flow'r in this letter of mine, And tell him where it grew, And whose were the hands that had planted it there In the Churchyard,—under the yew;— And a lock of the hair that he used to praise, And a kiss, I would send him too! He would find that the flow'r was faded and dead, That the bright brown hair was grey;— But the kiss that was his in the days of yore Would keep tender and true for aye;— Ah, me! if an answer could only come back Whatever there was to pay! THE BEST AND THE WORST. That is not always best which seems the best;— The hoped-for thing, the thing expected long; The rarer song Of songster bred in the remotest nest;— The fruit that hangs aloft at greatest height;— The pastime plann'd out for our own delight;— This is not always best. That is not always worst which seems the worst;— The joy denied; the hope condemn'd to fade; The blossom laid Low by the storm which our fond hands have nurst And tended lovingly;—the world foregone To solace those who suffer all alone;— This is not always worst. This is the best,—which may not seem the best Till man's true mission shall be understood; To seek the Good Tho' Evil follow on it;—to be blest In blessing others;—to esteem as naught The sacrifice of self in deed and thought;— This always is the best. This is the worst, which needs must seem the worst; To doubt God's goodness; find a friend unjust, Or feel our trust Rest on a broken reed; to know the first Of our heart's idols of all honour shorn; To see ourself turn'd to a thing we scorn;— This surely is the worst! 1890–2. THE LAST WORDS OF DON CARLOS. (Spoken to his Confessor, Fray Juan de Avila, Feb. 23, 1568.) “. . . . Entre les ouvertures de paix qui furent faites pendant la trêve, on proposa de marier le Prince d'Espagne, Dom Carlos, fils unique de Philippe et de Marie de Portugal sa première femme, avec Madame Elizabeth fille ainée de France . . . . aussi-tôt qu'il fut proposé, elle concut beaucoup d'estime pour l'époux qu'on lui destinoit. . . Le Prince d'Espagne n'etoit pas moins content de sa destinée . . . il s'abandonna avec plaisir à tout ce que cette idée lui inspiroit d'amoureux . . . Cependant les affaires changèrent de face par la rupture de la trêve . . . Il est aisé de juger quelle fut la douleur de Dom Carlos . . . et quelle fut sa joie quand on reprit la négociation de la paix: cependant cette paix qui flatoit si doucement ses esperances, fut ce qui le ruina pour toujours. Pendant le tems que la négociation dura, Philippe II. devint veuf par la mort de Marie Reine d'Angleterre sa seconde femme; comme il avoit dessein de se remarier, il fit demander pour lui la Princesse qu'on lui avoit accordée pour son fils: On auroit mieux aimé la donner à l'héritier de la Couronne qui etoit de même âge qu'elle, qu'à un Prince qui pouvoit être son père, et dont elle n'auroit que des Cadets, mai son ne put honnêtement le refuser.” —Œuvres de M. l' Abbé de Saint Réal (M.DCC.XXIV.) t. iii. p. 63–5. If we are to believe the contents of a Spanish Document purporting to have been written by Fray Juan de Avila (said to be the confessor of Don Carlos, and an eye-witness of what he describes), which was discovered in the archives at Simancas by the late Herr Gustave Bergenroth, and made public in 1870 (Gustave Bergenroth, a Memorial Sketch, by W. C. Cartwright, M.P.), the mystery which has hitherto shrouded the fate of this unhappy son of Philip II. can be accounted a mystery no longer. According to this authority, Don Carlos was privately executed by having his throat cut, by his father's orders, upon the night of Feb. 23, 1568, for complicity in the rebellion of the Prince of Orange and Counts Egmont and Horn in the Low Countries, after he had been previously imprisoned, tried for high treason, and subjected to the interrogatory of the Inquisition, accompanied by torture, the King having said, “that the judges should employ all lawful means of discovering the truth, just as though the accused were a common subject of low condition” (Gustave Bergenroth, p. 198). Letters of a somewhat compromising nature which, it is stated, had passed between the Prince and the Queen his stepmother, are said to have added greatly to the King's displeasure. A report was afterwards circulated to the effect that Don Carlos had died of illness in prison, the King not desiring “to make public the shameful conduct of his son, and he added, although he was perfectly justified, ‘There were people who would think him hard and sanguinary if they were to know the truth.’” This account differs materially from those of former historians who have agreed upon July 24 as the date of the Prince's death. Fray Diego de Chaves is the name given by Monsieur Gachard to the confessor of Don Carlos. —V. F. “You say, Fray Juan, I must die to-night, The King has sign'd the warrant. Be it so, Strange though such tidings be! I would not go Through future days in this disastrous plight, Nor these most miserable nights renew For all the wealth the Indies or Peru Could freight our galleons with. Each night I said ‘Would God that it were morn!’ and when the sun Show'd, by his first faint beam the day begun, ‘Would God that it were eve!’ Alive yet dead, “Il principe di Spagna . . . è talmente dimenticato da ognuno che pare veramente che non sia mai stato al mondo.” —Despatch of Florentine Ambassador to Cosmo de' Medeci, March 30, 1568. Betray'd, despoil'd of all, discredited And doom'd to death! Thus far am I undone! Bear with me, holy father, for a space, A few short moments, for I would retrace My piteous story, since we are alone. “Alone at last! and yet with all this load Of sins and sorrows! Kindly Heaven grants One of my pray'rs at least; those sycophants, Lerma, Ruy Gomez, Borja,—who abode Here in my chamber, watching night and day My ev'ry action,—have been call'd away To do their final service two hours since; To see that all is order'd, test the blade, Make fast the doors and have the sawdust laid Ready to drink the life-blood of their Prince; For this they left me. Think not that I wince To know their errand! Rather I rejoice Exceedingly, impatient for relief; So, since my time for converse here is brief, Hear me, good father, whilst I have a voice. “I am the only son of one who held The world in awe, yet am I not her son,— My sweet Señora . . . Thus was it begun This love,—this hatred,—never to be quell'd; The great King Philip who hath earn'd my hate, Taking my gentle mother for a mate, Begat me in the hey-day of his prime, Before Ambition kill'd poor Love with cold, So am I proud and headstrong, though I hold Nothing so good as Love. My mother's clime (My mother who departed ere her time,) Lent its volcanic fires to warm my blood To deeds of chivalry and high emprise, Yet so that in some lovely lady's eyes I fail'd to win approval, naught seem'd good. “So did the days go by that led to these . . . Though when King Philip, seeking wider sway, Turned his keen glance to those chill Isles that lay Wrapp'd in grey mists, amongst the Northern seas;— Where dwelt a lady, kindred of his line, Mary the Queen,—(daughter of Katherine, His father's cousin:) as God hears me now In His high place,—I swear that no ill-will Bore I the King for this! Nay, more, until His English wife had pass'd away, I vow I mused much on the brother I might know And greet and love one day, were he to reign And turn those islands of the stormy sea Into a second home, if I should be His brother-king upon the Throne of Spain. “Let me consider if that poor Queen's death Seem'd fraught with ominous presage to my heart? Nay, what King Philip took in such good part Was it for me to seem to groan beneath? . . But for the mourning weeds wherewith I clothed Myself from courtesy, mine own betrothed, My pearl of France, possessing all my soul, Turn'd my mind rather to my bridal cheer Than to that loveless lady's lonely bier. . . . Nay, but Fray Juan, you shall hear the whole, As God shall hear me! . . . When my father stole And made the bride that was my bride, his own,— How had you felt, if, haply, you had been A man not vow'd to God, or, unforeseen, Surprised a heart beneath your monkish gown? “I will not ask you. . . I, that am no priest But unregenerate man, have come to know The rancorous emotions that may grow Out of a heart thus trampled! No wild beast Defrauded of its prey, no mother torn From her one babe, no wanderer forlorn In arid deserts, in their bitterest hour E'er felt more mad,—more hopeless. . . Ev'ry day To see her face,—to be condemn'd to stay And watch King Philip wearing my white flower;— To call her ‘Queen,’ and ‘Mother,’ whom no power Might turn to wife of mine! . . . What had I done, Good father, to the great God over-head That, not in nether hell, but here, instead, It thus should please Him to torment His son? “Some say she shudder'd seeing his grey hairs,— And that he chid her, taking it amiss; (Mark you, 'twas not the Queen who told me this, I chanced upon the story unawares:) I have avow'd to you mine own intent, But swear again the Queen is innocent;— Go, tell my father:—shield her blameless head, Tell him his witnesses all swore to lies; That all the letters were base forgeries Invented by the foes who wish me dead,— So soon to be contented! . . . I have said Who heads the list,—what power clothed in might And majesty,—would have me cease to live For private ends: the guilty ne'er forgive,— And so it happens that I die to-night. “This ‘mutiny’ in Flanders. . . Is it rare,— A thing unheard of,—that to test his skill,— Redress abuses,—call it what you will,— A stripling, well-nigh driven to despair By passion, insult, anger,—should desire Some wider scope for the consuming fire That burns within his bosom? . . . I confess I thirsted for adventure;—that through me The disaffected Flemings might be free To live like loyal subjects;—none the less Did I desire the growth and happiness Of this wide Realm. Who taxes me with more? Alva,—ambitious of supreme command,— Gil Anton, One of his pages who swore facts to his disadvantage. justly chasten'd by my hand, And all the perjured crew that falsely swore! “Say to the Queen, my lady,—if she heard I was ‘tormented,’—like some common knave (I that am Prince of Spain!) that, not to save My body's bitter anguish,—by one word Shed I the faintest shadow on her fame; Nay,—rather say that nothing I could name Of words that she hath breathed or actions done, Had prejudiced the King.—To me, so soon Left desolate,—did she vouchsafe the boon Of motherly regard.—I seem'd her son And so she let the tender phrases run Knowing her pure affection undefiled And fearing no man's malice,—for my sin (The sin she had no part or parcel in,) Chiding me even as a wayward child. “See, on this book of Hours, (my lady's gift,) How the triumphant lion chased in gold,— The rampant lion of Léon,—seems to hold The helpless lily of France, as though to lift And toss it like a plaything, ere his grip Closes to crush it! . . Pray God that it slip Betwixt his claws, before those ravenous And cruel jaws can rend it! . . . As I pray My mind goes forward past the imminent day (Seeing her Royal blazon figured thus,) When this wild heart, that Love made mutinous, Shall cease to beat;—then is my soul oppress'd With fears for her; not Christ or all His saints Can drive them hence;—my faith in Heaven faints And demons come between me and my rest. “Yet must I turn to God, and seek relief Where such fears have no place, since I that stand Before you now, am by a father's hand Condemn'd to die ere morning! . . . Time is brief, The King hath sign'd the warrant, and tonight, Wrapp'd in a placid consciousness of right, He, even he, is praying for my soul! . . . Something rings false in this;—some error nurst Of man's fall'n nature;—thus to smite me first And then implore a Higher Power to enrol My name amongst the saved! . . . Mind you, the whole Of those ten thousand masses go to aid The Royal pray'rs; one thousand ducats' worth This year;—then yearly, till the end of earth, One thousand, at one hundred ducats paid. “I marvel much how men will deem I died . . . By fever, plague, or witchcraft? . . . At what tale Of filial disobedience Kings will quail Considering their heirs? . . . For he will hide The ghastly truth, and that which here to-night Is done in darkness, must not meet the light To-morrow, or for ever! . . . It were well To feign me mad, maybe, and mine own hand Mine own destroyer. Folks would understand, Look solemn,—shake their heads, and haply tell The tale so often told, of how I fell At Alcala, and on the narrow stair Left half my wits, and how the surgeon's knife Scoop'd out the rest—whence my rebellious life And shameful death—and bid their sons beware. “You know I would be buried in the robe Of the Franciscan order, with the hood Of a Dominican, “. . . un habillement de franciscain et un capuce de dominicain, dans lesquels il désirait être enseveli, comme il le fut.” (See Don Carlos et Philippe II. par M. Gachard, p. 473, and Letters of the Archbishop of Rossano, papal nuncio, of July 27 and 28, 1568, and Letter of Leonardo di Nobili of July 30, for Italian account.)—if the King thinks good;— This garb might suit his purpose. Who would probe Beneath such saintly covering, to seek Upon the throat the little tell-tale streak Conceal'd from all men's prying? . .I would lie In fair Toledo—at the convent there,— San Juan de los Reyes,—'neath a square Of plain Tortosa jasper; tapers high Should burn on festa days there, but the eye Must light upon no pompous blazonings, Carved catafalque, or broider'd baldaquin, Set up to glorify the clay within In sinful arrogance of earthly things. “And now farewell, good father; nay, one word— A word of warning.—Keep you,—guard you well; You wot of much it were unwise to tell (For even priests have tongues,) and I have heard That monarchs, when their servants come to learn Their secret dealings, have been known to turn Their favours from them. . . So you sleep secure, I charge you,—for your profit,—get you hence Out of Madrid,—inventing some pretence Of pilgrimage to foreign shrine,—the cure Of some old ill,—to serve for coverture. They say a dying man has clearer sight Than one whose eyes are dazzled with the glare Of this world's glory;—wherefore, have a care For these my words,—seeing I die to-night. “Pray for the guilty soul which I commend To God's great goodness! . . All who love me best Pray for me now! . . Is this some sorry jest To break my spirit, or indeed the end? Thus have I question'd,—doubting. Yet you say The King hath sign'd my death-warrant today, A King not giv'n to jesting. . . All is done Over and ended with me;—he hath pour'd Out all the vials of his wrath. . . Oh, Lord, Be thou more merciful! . . . His only son! . . . Son of the first wife of his youth,—the one They said he loved so well! . . . Help me to live Through these last bitter moments! . . . Stay, I hear Their footsteps on the stair. . The end is near;— Yes; you can tell the King that I forgive.” . . . “FIN DE SIECLE.” The world is old; old in expression of thought, Old in persistency to dare and do; Old in endeavour to revive anew The dead grey ashes that are burnt to naught By fangs of fiercest flame gnaw'd through and through. To us, who breathe this breath of latter days, Can anything seem true, or fresh, or keen, Whilst mocking voices whisper thus, between Our smiles and tears, “Ye tread in dead men's ways; That must wax weaker which hath always been”? The starved oppressors of a vanish'd race Cry out for sustenance, and seek their prey In hearts worn thin and callous, since To-day Passion and Impulse flag, whilst in their place, Reason inaugurates her colder sway. “How can I thrive,” asks Love, “on such poor fare? These know me not, my welcome is out-stay'd.” Pain, likewise, maketh murmur, all dismay'd:— “Where is my part in love, my tribute, where, In days gone by so generously paid?” Thus, pale and ravening, shall these two feed On hearts born out of time; a fated few Predestined, for their sorrow, to renew The fervid sense of some old Pagan creed Which may not perish, whether false or true. THE OLD ROCKING HORSE. (IN THE LUMBER-ROOM.) He stands in the desolate chamber, Snorting and pricking his ears, With the dauntless glance And the spirited prance That we knew in the bygone years; For full thirty summers and winters, From the dawn to the close of the day, Has he dwelt in this room, With never a groom, Or ever a feed of hay. The roof is so dingy with cobwebs, The window so coated with grime, That he only knows By the caws of the crows The morn from the evening-time. The mice, in their frolicsome revels, Sport over him night and day, And the burrowing moth In his saddle-cloth Has never been flick'd away; It is seldom his desolate dwelling Ever echoes to human tread, And its carpetless floor Is all litter'd o'er With the relics of days long dead. What a medley of eloquent lumber Do his proud eyes lighten upon, From those drums and flutes To the high snow boots And the mouldering stuff'd wild swan; And the ruinous magic-lantern, And the bottomless butterfly net, And the cage for the doves, And the prize-fighter's gloves, And the rickety old spinnet! He must know, this spirited charger, As he snorts and pricks up his ears, Why my heart is in pain As I toy with his mane And my eyes are half blind with tears; He must know who slept in that old swing cot, And who sat in that tiny chair, And who flew the great kite That ghostly and white Leans up in the corner there; And the bats, and the balls, and the ninepins, And the boat with the batter'd prow, Ah, that charger tall Knows who play'd with them all, And how sound some are sleeping now! Yet, for all this burden of knowledge, His bearing is proud and high, With the dauntless glance And the spirited prance That we knew in the days gone by; And in spite of his lonely confinement, His muscles are firmly strung, For the passing of Time, That has wither'd our prime Has left him still fresh and young. He wears saddle, and stirrups, and snaffle, And frontlet of faded blue, And a bridle rein On his flowing mane, And a tail that fits on with a screw. Alas, for the sorrows and changes Since, mounting this dappled grey, With whip in hand To some fairy land I was speedily borne away! On, on, to those unknown regions Where all are so fair and kind! . . . And away and away Goes the gallant grey, And we leave the world behind! How his stout green rockers are creaking! How his long tail feathers and streams! . . . How his whole frame thrills With “the pace that kills” As we hie to the land of dreams! Of those times, so good to remember, Few vestiges now remain, Yet here, to-day, Stands my gallant grey, With saddle and bridle-rein; And I think, as I stroke him sadly, “For awhile, how sweet it would be If the women and men, Who were children then, Could be all as unchanged as he!” FIRST LOVE. Oh, happy fresh awakening To first-felt-love,—a new-born thing,— So new, we murmur “What is this, This strange, sweet shyness, stealing o'er Soul, sense, and frame, from brow to lips,— From falt'ring feet to finger tips,— This kiss, that does not seem a kiss Like any we have known before?” New days may dawn, new blossoms blow,— New changing loves may come and go, Or loves that linger and try to stay,— Loves braver and truer than youth's fleet dream, But none that can ever so wonderful seem As that fickle first love that flutter'd away, With those first heart-bounds at a sweet surprise, And those first upliftings of tender eyes, And those hopes and tremors in secret nurst!— It was good,—it is gone,—but it still was good;— Tho' I would not beckon it back to me,—no! I would not beckon it back if I could, For I think it seem'd good but because it was first, And I know I could love more nobly now. BY THE SEA. She watch'd the silvery moonlight fling Its spell o'er Ocean's ebb and flow, And, feeling such a feeble thing, Wonder'd that she should love him so. He likewise look'd on moon and star, And saw the white waves lash the shore, And, feeling strong to make or mar, Wonder'd he could not love her more. AN “OLD, OLD STORY.” “Let me die with this ring on my finger, then fold my hands, so, on my bosom, I had never the heart to pawn it, tho' it wasn't a wedding ring; I have said how I came by it now: Last year, when the broom was in blossom, Down by the low-lying lands where the very first nightingales sing, When the lilacs were thick on the bough, but ere ever the hawthorn was over, When the evening shadows grew long, and the river seemed all in a glow, Whilst the grasshopper chirped under foot and the moths were aflit in the clover, Down by the low-lying lands—there is no use denying it now! Ah! if ever your sweetheart, your Will, had said anything half so tender, Had he pleaded thus night after night, and press'd you thus day after day— But, no! I may do you a wrong; you might never have made surrender, So, sister, forgive me my words, you might always have said him nay! But then, we were never alike, no more than the rose and the bramble, You were always so sweet and sedate, whilst I was accounted so wild, Ever ripe for a romp in the hay, or awake for a moonlight ramble, And with never a fear of aught since the day that I grew from a child. And Will—I mean not to offend, for you know it as well as another— Had courted me nigh two years, had been trying to make me tame; Will, who seem'd like a schoolmaster then—your husband since, and my brother— Had ask'd me to share his home, and had ask'd me to bear his name. So a good man cared for me once; surely this is a thought I may cling to, He took me for honest and true, tho' a trifle light-hearted and wild, A pupil to preach to and teach, or a playmate to fondle and sing to, Having no more notion of guile than might lurk in the heart of a child. But my heart was away at the Hall, with its tapestry hangings and armour, With its banner that waved from the tow'r over-looking the half of the Shire; I had drunk of the poison'd cup and bent low to the voice of the charmer, To the tempter that came to me clothed in the form of our brave young Squire. “What is Willy, in spite of his worth?” I said to myself, in my blindness, As I look'd at his gamekeeper's coat, and toss'd up my head in my pride; Tho' I knew, for the matter of that, that for honesty, wisdom, and kindness, He'd have beaten the very best husband that breathed in the country side. As I look from this hospital window, it all seems so long pass'd over, And more like a dream than a truth that I never may look on him more, That my bed must be under the turf, with only the worm for a lover, I'm glad, though I cried so at first, that the baby has gone before, For I mayn't feel so lonesome and lost in the great, grand heavenly palace; And mother may welcome me, too, that was taken a year last June; She will wonder at seeing me, her mad little venturesome Alice; And I shan't like to tell her, at first, how I come to be there so soon! Why should Love, that God set in our hearts, that was none of our own inventing, Bring so often a curse to us girls and plant such a thorn in our breasts? Did the robins and ring-doves at home, limp about broken-wing'd and lamenting, Just because, when the season came round, they pair'd off and built themselves nests? I know I'm a sinner; I know I scarce hope to go quite unforgiven; I bow to the dust, in my shame, in the sight of the Father above, But I seem to feel, somehow, quite sure, if I'm counted too wicked for heaven, That it won't be because when on earth I had learnt what it was to love! Let me die with this ring on my finger, then fold my hands, so, on my bosom, I had never the heart to pawn it, tho' it wasn't a wedding ring; I have said how I came by it now: Last year, when the broom was in blossom, Down by the low-lying lands where the very first nightingales sing, When the lilacs were thick on the bough, but ere ever the hawthorn was over, When the evening shadows grew long, and the river seem'd all in a glow, Whilst the grasshopper chirp'd at our feet and the moths were aflit in the clover, Down by the low-lying lands—there is no use denying it now!” TO THE BIRDS. (AFTER THE BREAK-UP OF A LONG FROST.) Ungrateful birds! that to my frosted pane, One short week since, importunately flew, Impell'd by “cupboard” love and greed of gain, A frozen-out, appealing, pauper crew, Where are ye fled? When all your world was white, And lying spellbound 'neath the breath that numbs, What timepiece taught you all to guess aright The frequently recurring hour of crumbs? Nay, did I chance to loiter, tapping bill Or eager chirrup made your presence known, As here you perch'd in line upon the sill Whence you have all unanimously flown! Pert sparrows, ever foremost at the feast, And strutting daws were wont to meet my view, With brave cock-robins, bright of eye and breast, And all the titmouse tribe, in buff and blue. The yaffel trick'd out in his parrot-green, Wearing his bright red cap; the screeching jay, The lesser woodpecker, so seldom seen; The little linnet, clothed in Quaker gray; The greedy speckled thrush, the crested finch And all his clan; he of the “golden bill,” Only last week, disputed ev'ry inch Upon this now deserted window-sill. But lo! a change has come! All Nature yields, The raindrops twinkle on the gleaming ledge, The snow forsakes the furrows of the fields, The river flows beneath its drooping sedge; And now the writhing worm and portly slug, Unconscious of their coming doom, prepare To leave their hermit-cells, secure and snug, And breathe once more the breath of upper air. So, gobbling sycophants! your need is o'er; And ye who cringed and truckled all day long, Now that she cannot serve you any more, Scarce deem your benefactress worth a song! A WIFE'S CONFESSION. “Hear me this once, my husband; you who deem Me stern and cold,—not loving mine own child, Our first-born son,—your darling and your heir, The child you mourn to-day! . . Hear me this once, Nay, do not hear, but read these written words When my sad voice is silent. Learn at last The story of these miserable years During the which I did my best to seem A happy wife and mother! . . . . . . You remember That day of days, just twenty years ago When, on the terrace-walk, amongst the yews, You said you loved me? All the world was still, Whilst the great sunflow'rs, like a row of ghosts, Stared out upon us from the garden beds. I can remember ev'ry word you said On that too blessèd ev'ning; how the years Had glided by, since you, a sailor lad, The second son of your illustrious house, And I—a baby girl—your Rector's daughter, Had play'd together 'neath those very trees In old departed days, and how, anon, Ere you had deem'd it possible,—so fast Tripp'd the light-footed years,—you came and found Your playmate grown to woman, and how your heart Had yearn'd towards her! Yet, because you knew Your life to be so shifting and unstable, You strove against your love. . . . . . . And then, you told The story of your elder brother's death, And how your father's—following so soon, Had left you lord of all, and changed your fate. Then, London and its snares, you spoke of next;— The careless, pleasure-seeking, empty life;— The making much of little and little of much;— Its men and women, wrapp'd in selfish aims, Envying, doubting, struggling, and for what? . . . And how, at first, all this had seem'd to you The best that life could yield, until, at last, You long'd for something nobler than this strife For mere amusement;—one, at least, to share Your so-call'd pleasures, and be gladder for them;— A human life to bless, a face to beam And brighten at your coming, and, again, In loftier moods—a faith, a hope, a home Which Love should bless; and how your lady-mother, Working upon your mood—had led your mind To centre upon one who proved unworthy, And made you deem all women vain and base, Until, one Sunday, in your village church, You saw me standing singing in the choir Dress'd all in white,—for it was summer time, Before the harvest. What you thought of me, Seeing me thus,—my innocence, my faith, My ignorance of evil,—all was true, My love, my life! in those too happy days. I swear the very semblance of a lie Had never pass'd my lips; upon my youth The watchful and all-seeing eye of God Seem'd ever looking down, to keep it pure. Yes; I was almost worthy, then, of you, Albeit a humble maiden, set apart From all temptation. . . . God knows how I fell Once the temptation came! . . . I like to muse Now, in my wretchedness, upon that day When, after church, hard by my mother's grave, With the great organ pealing down the aisle, You spoke, and took my hand, and read my heart! Then follow'd one sweet week of very Heav'n, Of more than human bliss! . . . The secret joy That comes of knowing and yet knowing not, This joy was mine; the golden moments flew As by enchantment; ev'ry day some pray'r Seem'd heard and granted, some new hope begot But to be realised, and then, at last, Came that blest ev'ning, when the giant yews Were black against the blushing summer sky, And Night was near at hand, to fold her wings Over two happy lovers! . . . . . . Was I cold, Or stern, or obdurate, in those dear days, As you have call'd me since? . . . Did not my heart, My very soul,—go forth to meet your love? . . . And then our wedded days;—Was I remiss In any wifely duty? If I err'd I knew it not—receiving only praise For ev'ry action; nay, then all went well! Too well,—too smoothly! Am I paying now In solitude and tears, the penalty Of having been vouchsafed too much of love, Too much of happiness? . . . . . . Your mother came, That was our first awak'ning from a dream Of sweet contentment. She was dear to me, Being your mother; I, to her, less dear, Being your wife,—the girl who cross'd her plans; (This knowledge reach'd me slowly!)—I would cast No blame on her, nor yet on faithful Alice, My more than second mother,—once my nurse, (God grant her soul repose, and give me grace Only to blame the guilty!) . . . Yet, their sighs And lamentations, at the childless house, Made the now growing hunger at my heart The more insatiate. Thus the days went by. And now, it seem'd, some transformation swept Athwart your spirit. You were noble, kind, And generous as ever, but some link That bound us in the past, seem'd snapt and gone. I know not if another had perceived What I,—who lived for nothing but your love,— Perceived so plainly, when, unconsciously, You said some little word that stabb'd my heart. You could not be unkind to living soul, Yet, now, to me, your kindness bore the taint Of condescension,—seeming, from a height, To light upon a being all too lowly To be a second self; whilst, oftentimes, You spoke regretfully of days gone by In which I had no share, as tho' you grieved To know them past and done. Or else, you dwelt Upon some sudden project for the future From which my sex debarr'd me; perilous search In Arctic regions, after shipwreck'd crews;— The tracking of the tiger to his lair In Indian jungles;—hurried journeyings By land and sea,—long absences from home, Alone, in distant climes; the roving life Of your past sailor years resumed once more. Yet always, when I ask'd you, did you love me? You answer'd; you had proved it, could I doubt? . . . But never, now, as in the dear old days, The precious words we women long to hear Leapt to your lips unask'd! And once at night, When you were lying dreaming by my side, I heard you echo, in sleep, your mother's moan: “A childless home!” Then, waking up, you said 'Twas strange your race had dwindled to one man And he unworthy;—lapp'd in aimless ease And self-indulgence!—One, alas, whose loss Would scarcely be perceived, were he to go, And take his place in his appointed niche Beneath the gray church tow'r! . . . And all this while, Early and late, one pray'r was in my soul And on my lips! Ah, wherefore, Lord of Heaven, Did I not go on beating out my heart In pray'r and supplication at Thy feet? Had I proved patient, all in Thy good time Thou would'st have lent an ear to my complaint! . . . Oh, erring human heart, this was thy last Of innocence and truth! . . . Henceforth, one dream, One hope, possess'd me, which some haunting fiend,— Some plausible persistent spirit of Hell,— (Albeit the germ was set in good intent And clinging tenderness,) did so corrupt And train amiss, that soon it came to bear A poison'd fruit! And now, ten married years, (Bringing no diminution of my love, But rather, thro' intensity of passion And longing unfulfill'd, transforming love Into a curse and torment,) glided by;— And still, the childless hearth—the aching void; Whilst she who once had well-nigh been your wife Had borne her husband seven stalwart sons, And round about, in all the cottage homes, Were piping voices heard, and pattering feet! . . . Then crouch'd the tempting demon at mine ear And whisper'd low; “His love is on the wane, The sure decline! Snatch at the fleeting treasure Ere it elude thee quite! Seize on the means Beneath thine hand; set mind and will to work, Achieve thine end, and earn thy sure reward!” (Read on, and as you read, knowing me dead, Forgive and pity! . . .) You remember how, From grief at losing you, I scarce could hold The warm tears back, when you departed hence For but one little week? Yet, when you went Your long projected voyage round the world I did not weep. A woman would have mark'd And wonder'd, fear'd, suspected! Not so, you, Being a man, and blind to many things! Ah, those were days of loneliness indeed, Yet, was I not alone; I nursed my hope, Matured my project; Alice, faithful Alice, (Nay, foolish, guilty Alice!) aiding me With sage advice and counsel. (She is dead; God's peace be with her, for she loved me well!) I do believe I would have sold my soul For that first letter, after you had read My joyful news! . . . You had been months away, When, at the very uttermost end of Earth, You learnt that God had hearken'd to my pray'r, And then, you wrote! . . . I, falling on my knees, Thank'd Heav'n for those sweet words! . . . Could I retract, Go back from my intent, once having read? . . . Having re-gain'd your heart, re-made you mine, Re-captured my lost treasure? . . . Could I keep All you bestow'd, yet seem to give you back No newer gift than mere undying love? . . . Twas thus I reason'd. Was I mad, misled, Or only, wholly wicked? . . . When we met, Ronald—the blue-eyed boy you mourn to-day, Lay sleeping in my arms. Can I forget Your silent greeting? . . . Yes; your heart was mine, I had reconquer'd it! . . . My love, my life, For just the time it takes to read these lines Try to be me; to see things as I saw With my poor woman's eyes! Last night you said, Looking on Ronald as he lay in death, These bitter words: “You never loved my boy, Our eldest born. You ever favoured Frank, Your second son, as having more of you, Your face, your disposition! . . . But I swear Here, by the coffin of my dear dead boy, That little Frank, for all his winning ways, Can never conquer in his father's heart The place that once was Ronald's!” These, your words, (Words we had sigh'd together, you and I, Had things been different!) went to my heart And stabb'd it like a knife! I did love Ronald Ere Frank was born! Who was as proud as I On his first birthday, when the bonfire crown'd Yon purple hill and lit the lake with flame? Or who more grateful, when your tenants traced A likeness to so many of your race Stamp'd on his baby features? . . . “God is kind And helping me,” (I thought), “He reads the heart; He heard the bitter cry—the ardent pray'r; He knew the need; the gracious gift besought; The gift denied! His ways are not our ways; Herein is consolation!” And the will, Helping the erring heart to cloud the brain And fire the fancy, made that seem the best Which had its origin in fraud and guile. We women, by some subtle alchemy, Turn fiction into fact, dross into gold, And, when we love, a man into a god!— What wonder then, this child, so full of life And strength and beauty, seeming like a link To bind your heart to mine, should come to be, For three short years, my darling and my pride? . . . “For three short years!” and then, my Frank was born, My very own! . . . And God's avenging hand Descended like a two-edged sword, to smite My guilty heart, and all was turn'd to tears And secret bitterness! . . . You loved not Frank As you loved Ronald! . . . 'Twas as tho' the want, The longing of your life, had been assuaged;— Your heart so fill'd, you had no need of him; You cared for him with all a father's care, But ever with a difference, whilst I Loved him as Ronald never had been loved, With all a mother's passion for the son Born after years of longing,—for the child Of her one love, the husband of her heart! (Oh, read and pity! . . .) All these seven years Since Frank was born, my life has been a Hell Of torment and remorse! . . . Ronald, the first, Ever before my boy! . . . Why was he tall And strong, and bold, and daring, and my boy Thoughtful and gentle, with a dreamer's mind, A student's nature? . . . “Having more of me,” You said, and said I loved him most for this;— Nay! more of you! . . . Ah, husband, let your curse Fall lightly on my head;—the head of one So humbled and abased! . . . No drop of blood Of yours, of mine, of your illustrious sires, E'er flow'd in Ronald's veins! The child you mourn Was but a pauper foundling; Alice knew His mother's name, and knew that he should prove A stalwart, comely lad, but she is dead,— (Peace to her soul!) Ah, look into your heart, And understand what brought my own to this, And read and pardon! . . . . . . When the tidings came That both the boys, whilst sailing on the lake, Had sunk together, and that one was saved Whilst one had perish'd, in my agony I pray'd. . . Ah, no! I did not pray for Ronald, But for our own sweet child! And God has heard Who would not hear before, and Frank is safe! . . . But, even as I clasp'd him in my arms, I saw the look of anguish in your eyes, And knew that you had pray'd another pray'r, A pray'r that was not granted! . . . I too mourn That brave young life, yet scarce have time for tears; Let him be laid beside me, I may prove A better mother to the boy in death! How could I live on,—knowing that you know, To meet your scorn, who, having lost your love, Risk'd Heaven to regain it? . . . . . . . Fare you well, Love of my life! 'Tis with a twofold aim I make my mute confession; to implant Some germ of consolation in your breast, (If this were possible), for Ronald's death, Who was no kith or kin to you or me,— And next, to plead for Frank;—to ask, for him, That first place in your heart, till now denied.— Once it was mine, my love, but I have vanish'd And pass'd into the everlasting shade,— The place is empty; these are my last words: “Give it to Frank, your own, our only child!’ THE DORMOUSE. (INSCRIBED TO SOPHY.) Lonely as Adam in his earliest hour, Or Alexander Selkirk on his isle, The Dormouse lay, beside a goodly pile Of nuts and seeds, within his latticed bow'r All snugly nested round with wool and hay. He slept his long protracted Winter-sleep,— A portly sleeper,—sleek, and fat, and full From Summer feasting, but nor hay nor wool Nor comfortable coverlid, could keep His body warm; 'twas thus the Dormouse lay. “The Dormouse!” . . These two simple words unfold His piteous story! Wrested from his kind While yet a mouseling, ere his tender mind Could frame a wish; whence loneliness and cold; He was the only Dormouse in the place!— A lonely orphan Dormouse, celibate, And banish'd from the beauteous world of bough And bud and blooming spray, and seeming now Albeit unconscious of his hapless fate, Like the survivor of some vanish'd race. Oh, what a wonderland he does not know Who has not heard the little rustling things That fill the forest with their whisperings, Or watch'd the scarlet foam-fleck'd toadstools grow, Or 'spied the barr'd blue feather of the jay! The Dormouse knew not these; all unreveal'd Were Nature's choicest secrets, tho' his mind Knew no regret. Thus “cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,” And e'en as one encompass'd and congeal'd In Winter's cruel thrall, the Dormouse lay. And oftentimes, at night, with slipper'd feet The fair Sophia of the golden locks Would softly rise, and take him from his box, And listen if his lonely heart still beat, Her young brow clouded with anxiety;— Fearing the very worst, because so cold] And death-like was his slumber, and his mien So absolutely placid and serene And purged of earthly passion. He seem'd roll'd Into a ball of pulseless apathy. Thus did his uneventful days go by Till Christmas came again,—the time of jests And merry-making. With it came two guests Of whom one brought a gift, which silently He slipp'd in Sophy's eager outstretch'd hand. Oh, gift acceptable and long desired Yet seeming, on account of last year's frost, A thing obtainable at too great cost To be by one of modest means acquired Thro' all the breadth and compass of the land! . . . And still the Dormouse slept, and if a thrill Pass'd thro' him in a dream, she knew it not Who, stealing to his dwelling, brought him—what? . . . This precious gift, and left it, lying still Next to his heart, amongst the wool and hay! Anon a change came over Nature's face, And e'en as our first parent woke, of old, The Dormouse thaw'd and waken'd, and behold! Still all unconscious,—in his limp embrace A lovely little lady-Dormouse lay! 1891. A LATTER-DAY MARTYR. King Winter, one Christmas, in Paris, Reign'd such absolute lord of the town, That he even clutch'd at the rich man's heart 'Neath his duvet of eider-down; Whilst the ladies in satins and velvets Were afraid to go forth in the street, But sat in their curtain'd boudoirs With chaufferettes under their feet: So bleak was the look of the winter, So eager the eyes of the poor, And so bitter the blast that enter'd Whenever one open'd the door; Whilst the Seine, like a torpid serpent, Had scarcely the heart to crawl, And a fog that was almost English Hung over its quays like a pall. Yet alone in his comfortless garret, Thro' many a darkening day, With not even a pipe to cheer him, A sculptor had work'd at his clay: A young man, hungry and haggard, With cheek-bones pointed and high, Tho' the flame of a quenchless ardour Burnt bright in his hollow eye. “It is finish'd!” at length he murmur'd, As he flung out his arms and sigh'd; “Praise be to the Holy Virgin, For the daylight has almost died!” Then he rose to his feet exultant, And quiver'd with pride as he stood And look'd on the fruit of his labour And saw that the fruit was good. He look'd on the placid forehead, On the tresses braided and crown'd, On the bold arch'd curve of the eyelid, On the cheek that was full and round; On the firm cleft chin with its dimple, 'Neath the lips that so proudly curl'd, On the face that still seem'd to the artist The fairest in all the world. Which mistress had proved the kinder,— This idol of ice and clay, Or Art, the Heaven-descended? . . . Both had made of his soul their prey, And what guerdon remain'd from either In token of service done, Of vigour and substance wasted? One token—and only one; This flow'r of the days of his labour, This star of the nights of his shame, This proud fair face that, for all its pride, Should serve as his step to Fame;— And she, even she, might be flatter'd, Albeit she loved him not, When she saw herself crown'd like an empress Who was only—no matter what! Then again he exclaim'd, “It is finish'd!” But, ere ever he went to rest, He wrapp'd up the bust in the tatter'd coat That cover'd his shirtless breast; As a mother might swathe her infant, He smoothed it down fold upon fold, And sigh'd, as he look'd at the image, “She was always afraid of the cold!” For so keen was the edge of the winter, So biting the teeth of its frost, That he knew, ere the grey of the morning, His labour might all be lost, And the name and the fame it might win him Be nipp'd, ere they came to the bud, Were the image of clay to be shatter'd Like the idol of flesh and blood. But alas for the dreams of the artist, For the castles he buildeth in vain! When the cold grey eye of the morning Peep'd in through the shutterless pane, It lit on the old coat shrouding The placid Imperial head— Whilst, naked and frozen, the sculptor Lay stark on his squalid bed. Then his friends of the Quartier Latin— A dissolute, thriftless band— Came clattering up the rickety stair To look on the work of his hand, And each one stood and marvell'd, With never a word to say, As he gazed from the corpse of his comrade To the “swan-song” utter'd in clay But anon the sous and the centimes, From palms that were hard and brown (For the heart may be large, though the purse be light), Grew into the franc and the crown; Then the circle of wonderers widened, And the silver was changed to gold, And the image was cast in deathless bronze That had weather'd that night of cold. And day by day, in the city, The fame of the statue grew; And the woman whose features it flatter'd Grew famous and wealthy too; And the name of the artist was honour'd, And all men sounded his praise, But never so loud as to wake him From his slumber in Père la Chaise! TO A NEW SUNDIAL. Oh, Sundial, you should not be young, Or fresh and fair, or spick and span! None should remember when began Your tenure here, nor whence you sprung! Like ancient cromlech notch'd and scarr'd, I would have had you sadly tow'r Above this world of leaf and flow'r, All ivy-tress'd and lichen-starr'd; Ambassador of Time and Fate, In contrast stern to bud and bloom, Seeming half temple and half tomb, And wholly solemn and sedate; Till, one with God's own works on earth, The lake, the vale, the mountain-brow, We might have come to count you now Whose home was here before our birth. But lo! a priggish, upstart thing— Set here to tell so old a truth,— How fleeting are our days of youth,— You, that were only made last Spring! . . . Go to! . . . What sermon can you preach Oh, mushroom-mentor, pert and new? We are too old to learn of you What you are all too young to teach! Yet, Sundial, you and I may swear Eternal friendship, none the less, For I'll respect your youthfulness If you forgive my silver hair! BY THE INDIAN MAIL. She writes in the dear familiar hand, In the sweet familiar strain, And the places and faces I used to know In the days that seem now so long ago, From the magic glow of that distant land Stand forth from the past again; And those cloudless skies of changeless blue, And the far-off city's gleam, And the dusky figures that come and go In the banyan shade by the bungalow, Are reveal'd once more to my troubled view In the flash of a waking dream. And she,—she is there, with her floating veil, Array'd for the morning ride, Or, crown'd with stars, at the Governor's ball, And ever holding my heart in thrall With the spell of her beauty, proud and pale, And drawing me to her side. Ah, me! what memories quicken and smart As I muse on that vanish'd time! . . . The moments of hope and the months of dread, And then, that one day,—to be mark'd in red, Which, because I knew I had gain'd her heart, Made a heav'n of that golden clime! Has her love grown cold that I read her words With such anguish of wild regret? . . . Nay! at sight of but half of this tender phrase My heart had become, in those bygone days, As grateful and glad as a forest bird's, And it touches and warms it yet. But my joy is kill'd by the gnawing pain Of a wound that can never heal,— A wound that, in spite of each loving line, Of each memory binding her soul to mine, All the days of my life that may still remain I never shall cease to feel; For long ere this letter had left the ship That was bearing it over the wave, A message, thrilling from East to West, Had told me the woman I loved the best (Alas, for the slips between cup and lip!) Lay cold in an Indian grave! ALL SOULS' DAY. (“LE JOUR DES MORTS.”) Ye that are dead and straitly laid to rest Above whose lowly heads The wand'ring winds of many winters blow When the soft falling snow Makes your green graves as white as live men's beds, Is not such slumber blest? Ye are at peace for ever; he that strove Hath reach'd the promised goal; The roofless wayfarer hath found a home Whither can never come Sting of regret, nor, whilst the ages roll, Pang of “despisèd love!” Your very silence is articulate Of stifled sob and sigh;— Of tumult still'd, dissensions quieted, Wherefore are most men led To milder mood in your vicinity Seeing your fall'n estate. In sweet unconsecrated fields, hard by, When village urchins play On summer days, with merry shout and call, Should the spent cricket-ball Or hunted insect chance to go your way, Hush'd is each joyous cry; Whilst happy lovers, should their straying feet Happen to pass you by, Grow half-ashamed of dalliance, for awhile, Seeing beyond the stile Or lych-gate grey, the quiet company Whose hearts have ceased to beat. Scarce reason so obscured, or sense so rude But that some pity, still, Akin to love, in brain and breast awakes For your departed sakes Poor prisoners, whose simple records fill A peopled solitude! To-day you hold your court, tho' voice nor sign Comes from your flow'r-strewn graves; Nay, you accept our votive offerings Even as sleeping kings Might take their tribute, seeing not the slaves Bearing the oil and wine! AT THE CLOSE OF A YEAR. The years have been fashion'd by man; the work of his meddlesome hand;— The landmarks he sets by the way that his blundering feet have trod,— He has parcell'd, and weigh'd, and appraised each pitiful atom of sand, And mapp'd out, and measured, and reckon'd The gift of an infinite God. So the breath of our lips, as we breathe it, is ever oppress'd by a fear;— “How many heart-beatings more ere the sum of our days shall be told? Are the sands already run down? . . . Have we come to the end of the year? Then those others are nearer at hand that must number our lot with the old!” All the same old symbols and sayings as when we were careless and young! . . . The new-born babe with his garland;—the grey-beard, wan with his wings;— All the well-known words to be said,—all the well-known songs to be sung,— The symbols, and sayings, and songs, that have turn'd to such sorrowful things! But the well-known friend at the board? . . Ah, there is his empty chair! . . So for us can the carols seem blithe, or the new year worthy his crown? . . Ah, ye makers and marrers of Time! ten thousand-fold better it were To have left us in peace till the end, with our days neither number'd nor known! For why, when our hearts may be brighten'd by Fancy, Affection, or Trust, Should we say, “We are old by the years, so our days of rejoicing are done”? And be no more esteem'd in the land than those Indians with pitcher and crust That are led out to wait for their doom in the wilderness under the sun? The reproach of a year cometh not of an Autumn mellow with prime, Of the bough bent down by the fruit,—of the husk thresh'd clear by the flail;— But of barren and profitless Spring, like a Winter mistaken in time, When the canker-worm gnaws at the root, and the blossom is strewn in the gale. So, altho' the Preacher hath said that our journey is only a span, I will not be cast down by the way at these records of perch, pole, and rod;— Our years may be many or few, they are mark'd out and measured by man, Let us count by the years of the heart, for the heart has been fashion'd by God.
