      <field name="fulltext">REDEMPTION, A POEM. IN TWO BOOKS. ? Let Mercy sweet Let boundless Mercy and redeeming love Remain my darling themes— Till in the regions of eternal day I sing enraptur'd, and renew the strain With energy divine.? TO THE DUTCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH THE FOLLOWING POEM IS (WITH HER GRACE's CONDESCENDING PERMISSION) MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED, BY HER GRACE's MOST DUTIFUL AND OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT, JOHN BENNET. BOOK I. CHAP. I. While others sing in high and lofty strains The mighty actions of great Monarchs reigns, Or in heroic numbers volumes swell And the dire deeds of earthly champions tell, Of thousands and ten thousands slain in War, What horrid deaths grac'd each triumphal car: My humble Muse attempts a nobler theme,— A subject which the harmonious hosts proclaim In those bright regions of eternal day, Where Angels and Archangels gladly play Upon their golden harps, sweet songs of praise, To celebrate Jehovah's wond'rous ways. Oh! for some spark of that celestial fire To aid my Muse to tune the sacred lyre, While I attempt those oracles divine, Where truth and mercy so conspicuous shine; To trace th' important plan, nor seek in vain, To paint the glories of a Saviour's reign. Assist thou holy Spirit by whose aid The soul of Man by sacred Truth is sway'd; By whom the world unfolds that blessed law, Which Man relieves, yet keeps his mind in awe. When great Jehove' dark chaos had illum'd, And order thro' the vast expanse assum'd; He Man created, upright, pure, and free, And station'd him in sweet felicity: Gave him a bride, of all his works most fair,— Plac'd them in Paradise, and bless'd them there. But ah! they fell, and lost that lov'd delight By envy joining with the Tempter's spite: Tho' seated in the bow'r of innocence, Where sordid ill had not the influence To warp their heav'nly minds, tho' upright made, Devoid of guile to make their hearts afraid, Not God's express command, not bliss compleat, Could keep them faultless in this happy state. Altho' in Paradise,—them Satan found, Came, saw, and quickly gave the deadly wound. Have you not seen the unsuspecting lamb With sportive gambols, frisk around its dam, While full security stands by his side, He laughs at danger as an ill too wide For him to fear,—'till wolves rush on the prey, Destroy his bliss, nor heed his bleating plea. Ev'n so the Tempter, foe to all mankind, Did our first Parents with destruction bind; Demolish'd all their joys, destroy'd their fence, And broke the stay of blameless innocence. Now thro' the earth the whole creation groan'd, And e'en the angelick host in silence moan'd; When lo! the great Creator call'd the Man, Who at the awful sound had always ran T' adore his love; but now he shrinks behind, In conscious guilt, some subterfuge to find.— Unnumber'd fears his sinking heart confound, His Maker calls—he trembles at the sound. Alas! vain Man, to fly Jehovah's sight, Tho' shrouded in the darkest veil of night; Is most absurd—as soon at thy command, Would cease the wonders of his mighty hand. But now behold the first sad interview, When tyrant sin had spoil'd Man's glorious hue. Disrob'd of innocence he tries to stand, And fault'ring says: I've broke thy great command, The Woman whom thou gav'st to be with me Has pluck'd the fruit of the forbidden Tree; And eat thereof, then gave me of the same, I eat and fell, by her delusive aim. When thus Omniscience,—Eve, what hast thou done? How could'st thou thus to sure destruction run? Did not I place thee in a Garden rare, Adorn'd with ev'ry thing both good and fair; Laid no restraint, but on that fatal Tree, How dar'd'st thou take what was forbidden thee? With down-cast looks, with mien, confus'd, and wild, The Woman cry'd, the Serpent me beguil'd; Perswaded me to touch,—I touch'd and eat, And then involv'd my Adam in my fate. Thus self-condemn'd, stern Justice heav'd her hand To strike the blow, for breaking the command; When Mercy interpos'd, remov'd the gloom And our first Parents heard their earthly doom. To Adam, thus—for heark'ning to thy Wife, Ills shall surround thee, sorrow, pain, and strife; And for thy sake, thrice cursed be the ground, With thorns and thistles shall it e'er abound; With weariness each day thou shalt be fed, And with the sweating brow shalt earn thy bread. To Eve, God said, thou gav'st transgression birth, Which banish'd innocence from off the earth: In thy conception, pains I'll multiply, And thou shalt on thy Husband's will rely: He shall thee rule, and teach thee to obey, Nor shalt thou murmur at his lordly sway. Then to the Serpent—as thy artful wile Has ruin'd Man, and fill'd his soul with guile, Accurs'd thou art, 'bove all that range the field, Nor shall the strength'ning herb thee nurture yield; Upon thy belly, creeping shalt thou go, And all thy life I'll dust for food bestow: Dust shalt thou eat, and for thy envious spleen, Such bitter enmity shall intervene Betwixt thy feed and Eve's, that for her weal, It sore shall bruise thy head, and thou his heel. Thus was their several dooms by justice seal'd, But how was heav'nly love to Man reveal'd! Can gratitude be dumb, or can the mind Cease to adore, to praise God ever kind? No sooner fell,—than Christ's redeeming love Was chorus'd by th' angelick host above: Join, join the theme, ye Heav'ns rejoice and sing, Loud hallelujahs to our God and King! But now, alas! with grief the first Man saw A horrid change for breaking God's dread law: The whole creation feels the mortal blow;— No more the luscious fruits spontaneous grow. Those fragrant sweets which Eden did adorn Must now give place to noxious weed and thorn. No confidence attends the brutish race, But they with fear shun Man's distracted face, Where shame and guilt, with equal terror reign, While deep felt ills his troubled bosom stain. Thus spotless purity, thus Nature fell, And thus lost Man became a prey to Hell; Became a prey to darkness and despair, Till hope was sent by great Jehovah's care To glad his breast, and ev'ry ill survive;— Tho' Adam die, yet Christ shall make alive. CHAP. II. By God's command, our Parents being driv'n From Eden's sacred walks, terestrial Heav'n, Were led by friendly Angels, whose discourse Disarm'd despair of her heart-gnawing force. When thus the Seraphs spoke— Scarce hadst thou tasted the forbidden tree, Before th' omniscient Pow'r thy fall did see; And thou hadst ever been in error lost Had not th' Eternal's mercy Satan crost. But yet—to keep his truth inviolate And raise with joy your low desponding state, Was such a task as not the heav'nly Choir, Not ev'n Archangels could thereto aspire. For when ye fell, in you the human race Fell in like manner with the same disgrace. Then shone abroad the Sun of righteousness With healing in his beams, to save and bless: Thus Man, poor helpless Man, dust of the earth, A Saviour has endow'd with second birth. Man is the object of his wond'rous love;— When Angel's err'd, and with presumption strove, Tho' sinking to the depths of woe, yet none No mediator offer'd to attone: But to behold the glorious Son of God, For wretched Man endure the scourging rod With all the weakness of the human race, Excepting sin, to free him from disgrace, Makes Heav'n and Earth resound with love and praise, To celebrate the great Jehovah's ways. As stand the hearers of a Pastor's charge When Gospel truths of Heav'n their minds enlarge, While keen attention all their thoughts confine T' embrace the doctrines of the sound Divine: So stood our Parents, while their heav'nly friends Unfold what greater bliss their Maker sends. Redemption's by th' Eternal Godhead plann'd, And perfect made by the Almighty hand, To save, to comfort, to create—agree With the perfections of this mystery. Now as all Heav'n seem'd touch'd, with thy sad fate, Hear thou, O Man, how God has chang'd thy state. Jehovah seated on his heav'nly throne, To the angelick host his will made known, And thus th' Eternal spake— Since disobedience to the righteous laws Of justice, truth, and right, has given cause For sin and death, mortality to wield Over the earth, Creation's fairest field: The guilty Pair unto the world I'll, send, Nor shall the Tree of Life their station mend. Man whom I made the favourite of Heav'n, To whom my Angels free access had giv'n To guide, to warn him of the dangerous sin Of disobedience, and his thoughts to win To holy deeds, to praise and to adore His great Creator, God for evermore, Is now a foe—is lost—what dreadful change,— Depriv'd of Paradise—he now must range, With loads of guilt, unworthy of the life I gave, and dwell with wretchedness and strife; And then—must die—yet he shall rise again, Can one be found who will his cause maintain? Hear then, ye Cherubims; I now decree That Man to life restor'd, immortal be. Man shall find mercy, all his race shall live, When death and sin no terrors more can give; If one of all these hosts will offer up Himself the victim, and will drink the cup Of my offended wrath,—will undertake To die—to suffer—for the first Man's sake. Thus spake Omnipotence; but who could shew Unbounded love, and meet th' extreme of woe;— To die in Adam's stead, to suffer all That load of sin which came by Adam's fall? No Angel or Archangel made reply, But silence reign'd thro' all Heav'ns canopy. And when none could assist the first Man's state, Th' Eternal's Son became his advocate; With Mercy's rays he cloath'd himself immense, And gladly offer'd to clear Man's offence; Nay would unite with frail Mortality,— Would take Man's nature, suffer, bleed, and die. Then all the host of Heav'n with wonder view'd The Christ Messiah with such love endu'd: Around the throne with joy and praise they throng, And tune their golden harps to vocal song: The Hallelujah and Hosanna sing, And make the arch of Heav'n with glory ring. CHAP III. As balm pour'd into wounds whose healing pow'r Returning bloom of health at once ensure, E'n so the Seraphs words uprais'd the pair, And comfort chas'd away the sting of care. When thus they further said; what happy view Has Man before him, if he will renew Obedience to his God, th' unbounded love Of Christ the Lord, to fix his joys above. Creation and Redemption we unfold, Thy fall and restoration we behold: The justice,—mercy we've admired and prais'd, Triumphant o'er the Tempter's envy rais'd;— All this flows from the goodness of thy God, Who shakes the Heavens with his awful nod; By whom dark chaos from the globe was hurl'd, And order call'd to grace this lower world. Sun, Moon, and Stars he made, thyself and all, And into being will thy offspring call, So great, so num'rous—yea, thyself and Eve, With Sons and Daughters, many days shall live, But as you've both experienc'd bitter woe, Never neglect God's wond'rous works to shew, Thy children's children, and in hoary age Let his great mercies all thy thoughts engage T' instruct their tender years—then their increase Will ev'ry day bring to you lasting peace.— Then when the period of your life comes on, And all your business on this earth is done, God will receive you to eternal joy, In realms where praise shall ev'ry tongue employ. Thus did the Angels condescend to tell, And guide our Parents how they should repel The wiles of sin, and then with mildness shew How the blest Spirit would within them glow, T' instil a sense of attributes divine,— How Providence and Mercy e'er would shine Around them, how, God's goodness would suppress Their daily wants, and them support and bless; That tho' unseen, themselves had strict command To watch and guard them from th' en'my's hand Who tempted them to sin, nor should they find Posterity unguarded left behind. And now, O Man, with love we greet you here— Be strong in faith—in paths of virtue steer. This said—immediately a ray of light Darted refulgent arm'd with holy might, Which pour'd into the Pair a pious flame, Who prostrate on the earth with thanks proclaim God's wond'rous works, the mercy, love and praise, Which to lost Man, Salvation now displays. Then rising, thus to their Angelick friends— Ye whom a gracious God unto us sends, Accept these tears of love and gratitude For the sweet joys your converse has renew'd, Within our heartless breasts; but when you go, Shall we not plunge again in bitter woe? The Angels answer'd, Adam now you are Sole Emp'ror of the earth, and to thy care Has been committed pow'r o'er all therein, Adore your Maker, strive to keep from sin; Believe you are the objects of his love, That by obedience he will you remove Where sorrows are no more; but now employ Your time as mortals,—with content enjoy The moments as they rise, behold thy Bride The fairest of Creation by thy side. Her cherish and instruct,—nor fail to raise Each morn thy tribute of unfeigned praise, To magnify Jehovah's glorious name, And let thy tongue most gratefully proclaim His wond'rous deeds; then when thy labours call Thee to thy daily task, think on thy fall But let thy thoughts be such as to adore Thy Saviour's boundless love for evermore. Nor let the eve pass on,—but you return A willing sacrifice; your hearts will burn With grateful worship, when your mind reflects How you have pass'd the day, how God protects You through the dangers which your paths attend, And from its num'rous crimes will you defend. Thus time will pass, in peace you will remain, 'Till God's great summons bids us meet again. This said, th' holy Angels gain'd the sky, Sounding the praises of the God most high. Like to that tender soene, that parting day When Parents leave th' habiliments of clay, Around their bed their weeping children stand, To gain a blessing from their dying hand, When lo! the tie dissolves, the Spirit flies Nor stays to hear the mourners piercing cries, But sighs farewell, and mounts th' heav'nly skies. Ev'n so the first Pair took their last adieu, Nor tears nor sorrows could the scene renew; With longing eyes they strain t'wards Heav'n's alcove, Till lost in space the objects of their love. To comfort Eve, thus Adam then began, How merciful and kind is God to Man! Tho' great our fall, my suff'ring partner Eve, No more let us with anxious sorrows grieve; The greatest act of kindness let's adore, And praise that union which does Man restore. For I foresee, that thro' thee shall have birth A num'rous race to overspread the earth; More than the stars of Heav'n in multitude, And in time's fulness then shall be renew'd That glorious promise, which we trembling heard, When Justice, Love, and Mercy we rever'd. Fair Eve reply'd, O Adam, I adore The wond'rous works of God, and grieve no more. Far, far beyond our merits we are rais'd, Nor can his glorious name too much be prais'd. Yet to compare this wild extensive scene To Eden's walks where peace was ever seen; Where when we 'rose to meet the rising Sun, No sinful guile e'er told us God to shun; So lovely and so fragrant all things smil'd, 'Till by the Tempter's wiles I was beguil'd: But what a contrast do we now behold, Expos'd to storms, and tempests, wind and cold. See how the black'ning clouds tumultuous rise, Their gloomy aspect seem t'invade the skies; The air no longer breathes that sweet repose We felt in Paradise, when free from foes, With innocence we reign'd; then no distrust Was seen in animals,—but Nature's curst: The raging lion kills the helpless lamb While tygers seize, and tear its bleating dam: They tear regardless of their cries and pain: Oh sin, I fear the terrors of thy reign! Her fears then Adam in affecting strain Strove to divert, nor reasons he in vain. Plac'd by th' Almighty in a fruitful land, Where bounteous Nature with a copious hand Still pours her blessings forth, resign thy care, Dispel thy sorrow, and her comforts share: A thousand objects lead me to delight, To please the fancy, or employ the sight; And in thy lov'd society I find My chiefest bliss, sweet soother of my mind. Forth will I seek some calm secure retreat, And raise a shed to keep us from the heat; To keep us from th' inclement piercing cold, Where happiness and pleasure shall unfold Their mutual bliss, to ease thy sorrows here Domestick comforts will demand thy care, That great and good materiating Pow'r, Will soon new blessings on his creatures show'r; O then what gratitude, what thanks are due To our Creator, God and Saviour too! This said, their knees forth press'd the yielding sod T' implore protection on their new abode. O thou great Being, Father, Lord of all, Who didst thy servants to existence call, With shame and guilt we own thy sov'reign sway Which we've abus'd; but teach us to obey Thy holy laws! O make us call to mind Thy bounteous love, to bless and save mankind! Most gracious God! when thou shalt children send, Let thy protecting grace them e'er defend: Be thou their guide, their Saviour, and their God, On whom their trust may make its firm abode. CHAP. IV. Confirm'd in hope our Parents 'rose from pray'r, And sought in fragrant shades repose from care. The Sun in ev'ning splendor made retreat When Adam, Earth's sole Monarch, fix'd his seat Nor let vain grandeur scorn his simple life, Alike remote from luxury and strife: Without his flatterers, or empty forms, Or artful wranglings base, or state rais'd storms; Yet first in earthly pow'r, most absolute O'er kingly lions to the meanest brute, He knew their properties, their various wills, And all the knowledge education fills Spontaneous 'rose in him;—for his great mind Was fram'd thus high, to benefit Mankind. Nor were his subjects few, each animal Fit for his use, was ready at his call. Thus Adam reign'd,—yet earn'd his daily bread And was by labour'd cultivation fed, For what so requisite here to sustain Existence free from hunger, want, and pain? Now time who never stops his swift career, Gave Sons and Daughters to the first made Pair; From whom the earth was stock'd with nations round While sin and death their horrid influence found. Then came the period great Jehovah will'd To have his wond'rous prophecies fulfill'd; Those prophecies which spoke that gracious plan The restoration of degen'rate Man. That when all hopes of mercy from him fled, The Woman's seed should bruise the Serpent's head. The royal sceptre fix'd in Judah's line Shall not depart,—until that Shiloh shine Upon this earthly globe, and unto whom The various people of the earth shall come:— His shall the gath'ring of the people be Salvation's rock to all that to him flee; A Man of griefs, who felt Affliction's rod, The great sin-off'ring holy to his God, The Passover, the Lamb without a scar, The corner stone, and the bright morning star, The sprinkled blood, and in the wilderness The Serpent lifted up to heal and bless. He is the scape-goat, laden with the crimes Of sin imputed now, and after times; The covenant, the bow, the mercy seat, The ephod, holy ark, and the breast plate: The jubilee, the manna, the perfume, The great atonement to avert our doom; Th' extensive ladder which shall mortals raise To Heav'n by easy steps with pray'r and praise; The Paschal Lamb, the victim to be slain, Who bore our griefs, iniquities, and pain; Afflicted and despis'd, was sore oppress'd, And sadly bruis'd to make transgressors bless'd. These were the types the Son of God fulfill'd, And whereon Man doth his Salvation build; These were by Israel's tribes well understood Whose hopes rely'd upon the promis'd good; By the Almighty's oracles prepar'd, Which Christ's mysterious birth had well declar'd, They never strove with subterfuge to wave The boldest truths, a Virgin shall conceive And bear a Son, Immanuel his name, The Father, God of everlasting fame, Wonderful Counsellor, the Prince of Peace, And David's throne shall ever find increase. On him the holy Spirit shall remain And truth and judgment e'er adorn his reign; In him malicious rancor shall subside, And rage and turbulence be thrown aside. “The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead, And boys in flow'ry bands the tyger lead; The steer and lion at one crib shall meet, And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim's feet;” With stinging asps shall play the suckling boy, Nor shall the cockatrice the child destroy; But with true peace the earth shall then be stor'd, With goodness and the knowledge of the Lord. With dignity the sacred truths proceed To shew the glorious acts by God decreed;— The deaf shall hear, the lame shall leap for joy, And to his name the dumb shall songs employ. O sing, ye Heav'ns! resound with holy mirth, Shout, shout for joy, ye denizens of earth! Let ev'ry mountain in the Lord rejoice, “Ye forests wave in honour of his voice!” Listen ye isles, ye distant nations hear, And for the coming of the Lord prepare! O Zion, put on strength, awake, awake, And thou Jerus'lem for my mercies sake Behold thy light is come,—arise and shine, On him my glory shall appear divine. 'Tis I have call'd, in righteousness will stand;— 'Tis I the great I AM will hold thy hand, Will guide and keep thee for a cov'nant made To light the Gentiles from destruction's shade. Oh deep! oh wonderful supernal love, How doth God's oracles Man's fears remove; The great Jehovah condescends so low T' unfold his works to Man, his greatest foe. He who hath measur'd out the vast abyss, And spreads abroad the seat of glorious bliss; Who fix'd the stars within the great expanse, And at whose word th' unwieldly planets dance; Who ascertains the dust of all the earth, And weigh'd the hills and mountains at their birth,— 'Tis he redeems and saves,—bless'd be his name, Let Heav'n and Earth with joy his praise proclaim. CHAP. V. As Heralds sound the titles of the great, And blaze their actions to exalt their state, Ev'n so the Prophets tho' in higher sphere, The great Messiah's glorious deeds declare. Tumultuous war now thro' the earth did cease, And feuds gave way to universal peace; Vindictive Rome quite satiate with blood, Like to a glutted monster quiet stood; Proscriptions ceas'd, but not till Tully's fate Was seal'd to shew the evils of the state; And that vain Emperor, who to his pride Could give up freedom, yea, his friends beside, Now sat to hear his flatt'rers offer up Libations from their vile dissembling cup, While he to render state nor station free, With haste now issues forth his great decree, That all his wide domains should taxed be. The arbitrary summons all obey, For despotism reigns with boundless sway. Thus when Oppression first rear'd high his rod, Fear shrunk, and turn'd the Tyrant to a God. Each district to its city now repair'd, Not age or sex could meet the least regard, All are enroll'd, ev'n Pharisee and Scribe, Must now appear with family and tribe. Of royal blood of Judah's famous line A pair to Bethl'em came, to pay their fine; By poverty made low, yet rich in zeal, Did ever goodness with Jehovah fail! The Husband's name was Joseph, and his Bride Was Mary call'd, humility her guide; Forewarn'd of God, she at the accomplish'd time, Brought forth the Saviour Christ, a King sublime; But ah! so mean, a stable was the inn, A manger held th' Extirpater of Sin. And tho' so high, from earthly pomp conceal'd, His birth to mighty Rome was not reveal'd; But humble Shepherds keeping watch by night Over their flocks, receiv'd this glorious light From Gabriel, one of th' ethereal line, Who thus address'd them, in those strains divine. I bring you peace, dismiss your needless fears, Receive the tidings which all nature cheers; Ev'n now to you in holy David's town Salvation, God's best gift, comes freely down, Of Mary, whom the purest charms adorn, The holy Christ, the great Messiah's born: Go seek your Saviour, and observe this sign, In swadling cloaths is wrapt the Babe divine, And in a manger does Immanuel shine. The Shepherds rais'd their eyes in great amaze, Almost o'ercome with the resplendent blaze; When to the heav'nly Harbinger there came A num'rous host of the angelic frame, Joining in praises, and with loudest strains Sung Hallelujahs to their King who reigns O'er all,—in all, who sent his only Son To finish what his mercy had begun. Enraptur'd with the news the Shepherds flew And found the Babe expos'd to public view. Thus was the union hypostatical, Which rescu'd Man from his destructive fall; And which at once astonish'd, sav'd and blest,— To all the nations round made manifest: This was the myst'ry to the just made known, The holy Simeon rich in faith, was one. Full of that spirit which reveals all truth, The consolation waiting from his youth, Who when he'd seen the goodness of the Lord, His heart a song of thankful rapture pour'd. Like as the swan when drawing near the end Of her existence will her last breath spend To sing her solemn dirge in warbling strains, Fearless (as Poets tell) of dying pains. So holy Simeon his last requiem sings, To Christ his Saviour, as the Mother brings Him to the Temple, fearless of th' alarms Of death, he takes him in his longing arms; And in the fulness of his soul declares The mercies of his God, in fervent pray'rs. While with a holy flame my heart doth glow In peace, O Lord, let now thy servant go; For thy salvation have I seen this day, The rock of ages Isr'el's glorious stay, To all the Gentile world the heav'nly light, Yea such a wonder glads my failing sight, In thee my Saviour, God and Man unite. Thus in the Temple sung the holy Seer, The list'ning wond'ring crouds the tidings hear; While 'midst their fervent joys the Virgin blest, Receives the holy Infant to her breast; Chanting the strains which thankful minds engage Recorded to be hymn'd in ev'ry age. My grateful soul doth magnify the Lord, And in my heart my Saviour is ador'd; For he regardful of my humble state Hath chosen me from Daughters of the Great; And now behold succeeding ages shall In rapt'rous wonder me God's Mother call. For He the God of everlasting fame Hath blessed me and holy is his name. His tender mercies doth he wide extend To ev'ry generation without end; His holy arm all nations gathers in And ev'ry humble soul's restor'd from sin. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, And high exalted those of low estate; To Abra'm he his promise will maintain Which to his faithful seed shall e'er remain. Such was the Virgin's song, such was her praise, Thankful altho' adorn'd with glorious rays Of pow'r divine, declaring to Mankind Humility must true devotion bind. Here let th' ambitious Mortal make a stand, Who vaults in pride, and braves th' Almighty's hand; Let him reflect on the Messiah's birth, That God supreme should mix with sinful earth; Should deign his earthly being to receive, Remov'd from all the comforts wealth could give;— No stately rooms, no downy couch to rest His Virgin Mother, weary and distress'd With her long toil, and tho' of royal blood, Almost a stranger to Earth's common good. Such was the station which our Saviour chose T' encounter guilt, to free Man from his foes, Born in a stable, led a life obscure, Was oft insulted, as he pass'd each door With sad revilings, scoft at as the son Of a mechanick, and despis'd as one Who shew'd himself the Publicans fast friend, And to vile sinners did his love extend. Mistaken Men, like Caiaphas you speak, Who said it was expedient, for the sake Of all the people, that the Christ should die, But what he said, he spoke unwittingly. Ev'n so when you your Saviour dare revile, And say that Publicans receiv'd his smile, And that he was the wretched sinners friend, Do not reflect—this was his only end. For when he conquer'd sin, and rent the grave All were vile sinners, whom he deign'd to save. The great Forerunner's mission now began, Who preach'd aloud Salvation's come to Man. Ye senseless nations, deep involv'd in sin Ye crooked, harden'd, let repentance win You to your God, behold the holy Lamb, The promis'd sacrifice, the great I AM. I verily baptize with Jordan's stream, But he who after comes deserves such fame, That ev'n to bear his shoes I can't aspire— Shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire. In expectation all the people mus'd, And in their thoughts of Christ was much confus'd; Thinking the Baptist He—with longing eyes They view'd, then deem'd that under him should rise The house of Isr'el, and that quickly they Would be deliver'd from the Roman sway. That he would David's regal house maintain, And give them rule and liberty again; But of a heavenly reign, tho' King of Kings, They little thought, nor understood such things. Thus have I seen an infant at his play, Throw wholesome food for paltry trash away: Nor can substantial good attract his sight, But tinsell'd trifles form his chief delight. John still continu'd to declare around Now was the time, th' accepted season found. Ye, whom in this clear stream, I now baptize, Learn thro' repentance happiness to prize! 'Tis your Redeemer, him of whom I spake, Your gracious God, who bids you all forsake Your evil ways—who comes as with a fan To fan like chaff, guilt from degen'rate Man; Who comes adorn'd with purity most bright, Who is, and ever was the truth and light. While thus the Prophet their approaching good Reveal'd, the people in amazement stood. Yet some whom he baptiz'd unto him came, Saying, that now thou must support thy fame; If not the Christ, why dost thou then baptize? Art thou Elias, whom we trust shall rise, And happiness restore to Isr'el's race, Say art thou come to bid our troubles cease? The Prophet answer'd—I've baptiz'd 'tis true, But he of whom I spake, is now in view; And as refiners purify their gold With fire intense, from all its drossy mould, So will the great Messiah you refine And like pure gold, will make your nature shine: I'm come a witness only to disperse His glorious deeds to all the universe. CHAP. VI. To Jordan's banks whose waters sweetly glide Then to the Baptist came our heav'nly Guide; There to receive in those transparent streams That holy rite, which thro' the world proclaims The Christian's glory: when John thus addrest With great humility his sacred Guest. And comest thou, to be baptiz'd of me? Rather let me receive that bliss from thee, My holy God, from this let me abstain, O wash me, wash me from corruption clean! To whom the mild, the bless'd Redeemer said, Thou to perform it be not now afraid; It must be so; for we therein fulfil The sacred law, and God's most holy will; Then was the Christ baptiz'd— When lo! the Heav'ns a glorious scene display'd, And that great Pow'r, who when the world was made Illum'd the whole,—bid ev'ry creature move Descended in the semblance of a Dove. The Holy Ghost on your redeeming friend Now rests, oh Earth, in silent awe attend! And ye blest Angels, that the throne surround With praises hear, how mercy doth abound To sinful Man. Jehovah speaks, indeed, And shews Salvation in his glorious meed. Man can no longer doubt, no longer say, That Christ the great Messiah makes long stay, His coming, Heav'n and Earth do witness bear While God th' eternal Father speaks his care,— “This is my Son, my well beloved Son,” O chearful sound, thou wond'rous three in one. This is the evidence which shines so bright And gives the world such glorious rays of light, The sacred undivided Trinity, One God in essence, tho' in persons three, Or as recorded by the inspir'd John, The Father, Word, and Spirit, three in one. The work stupendous to preserve Mankind, To the Messiah being now assign'd, In this high state with lowliness behold The Prince of Peace, his sacred truths unfold, To poor unletter'd Fishers, men who knew Those ills which must from earthly wants accrue, These he ordain'd to aid his vast design, To raise Mortality to life divine. No men of eminence his doctrine taught, No Ministers in Palaces he sought, Where Learning, Wit, and Elocution shine In all the splendor which the world calls fine. Nor did he try the Pharisees to gain, To be attended by a deep taught train; But those he chose were humble, poor, and meek, These were the Mighties, Christ vouchsaf'd to seek. With these he went abroad— While crouds admiring, follow'd to behold The Lamb of God, his gracious love unfold; Who with compassion and a heav'nly smile In plain, descriptive, yet enchanting stile Sets Heav'n's delights before them in array, And each beatitude declar'd the way. Thus preach'd the Saviour of the world around, While pow'r and energy his preaching found; Not like the pompous doctrine of the schools, Reveal'd in formal and unmeaning rules, T' amuse the head, but not the heart improve, Nor from the sinner fell despair remove. Ah! where is He, who has no higher aim Than what the soundness of his morals claim? Say what can Man, all imperfection, do, Whose highest virtues are his duties too; Infirmities and errors him surround, Disturb'd societies oft him confound; The duties of each moment still come on, And blessings rise up with the rising sun. Health, family, and friends, air, light, and food, With all those pleasing joys the earth calls good, Are blended in him; but when sin appears It sinks him down amidst desponding fears. Or where's the over-righteous in God's law Whose high-wrought zeal will not admit a flaw In human state, but like the Pharisee Who would not with the Publican agree, To pay devotion to the living God, But pledg'd himself free from the dreadful rod That's due to sin, and thought vain-glorious pride Would rather aid than cast his plea aside. Alas! such specious cov'rings wont avail, For in the day of wrath they'll surely fail. But when th' atoning Lamb, without disguise, Appears the meritorious sacrifice, Then Man appropriates, new life, new light, And all his guilt is taken from his sight. By this I know that Christ was born for me, Fulfill'd the Law, and suffer'd on the Tree; And in my nature has he mourn'd and dy'd, Eternal justice too has satisfy'd; Has finished my redemption with his blood, On this I stand, on this my faith holds good; And as in Adam none can death survive, Ev'n so in Christ shall all be made alive. Here then begins the Christian's life,—a war Which we against a sinful world declare. Now all those ills the human passions rear'd, Which would allure us from fair Virtue's guard, Fly far behind,—they've lost the pow'r to charm, Nor can the hoping Penitent alarm; But Truth and Mercy bid the conflict cease, And lead the faithful Soul to endless Peace. So the industrious labourer pursues His daily toil, inspir'd with pleasing views; Each chearful day he acts and hopes the best, And night rewards his toil with tranquil rest. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. CHAP. I. The great Messiah having told the plan Of his redeeming love to sinful Man, And Twelve selected to reveal the word, To shew Salvation was with mercy stor'd, With high commission did them now ordain To heal the Sick, to make the Lepers clean; And by that pow'r which wond'ring thousands fed, They cast out Devils, and they rais'd the Dead. Then as the careful Shepherd will not leave His flock to others, lest they should deceive, But watches for its welfare and relieves The various maladies which oft it grieves, So Christ commiserates the great distress Mankind is subject to, and gives redress To all their many ills; his bounty feeds The hungry, and th' afflicted sinner leads To peace, if he with penitence believes And faithfully this word of truth receives,— That Jesus dy'd to satisfy that wrath, Which Adam's disobedience brought on earth. He that with true repentance thus relies On his Redeemer, at the great assize Shall be presented holy, just, and pure, T' enjoy that bliss which ever shall endure. Such who believe and love will goodness trace, Their souls will be adorn'd with ev'ry grace That can proceed from so sublime a cause, While firm obedience to God's holy laws Will surely follow,—purity of mind, Just, sober, chaste, benevolent and kind, Forgiving and forgetting, yea they'll know What e'er from grace, from love, or truth can flow Shall shine in them;—this is that second birth Which opens pure delight to Man on earth: For these he quits the world's delusive charm, These are the weapons which the Christian arm. Thus clad, regardless of each scene of strife, He calmly passes on thro' fleeting life, Which spent,—the soul ascends th' ethereal skies, On wings of joy to gain th' immortal prize. So the deep stream moves on with steady pace And gliding slow maintains its constant race; But when the Sun irradiating shines, The grossy exhalation he refines, Then by attraction drawn it speedy flies Leaving its earthy bed to mount the skies. But now behold the gloomy period's come Big with the fate of universal doom; The gath'ring storms appear—lo! death and sin, Affliction, pain, and guilt converging in That bitter cup, which must be drank, tho' fill'd With all the wrath th' eternal justice will'd. The mighty sword is drawn, upheav'd in ire, While vengeance rages like a flaming fire, The passive Lamb immaculate, unstain'd By sin, is now tumultuously arraign'd, By those for whom he bleeds. In Isr'el's land The traitor Judas with a chosen band Of Soldiers arm'd, pass'd o'er the brook which flows Along the vale Gethsemane, where rose A garden like to Paradise adorn'd, And where the Saviour oft retir'd and mourn'd For worthless Man, where once he was display'd To his lov'd friends, in heav'nly light array'd.— The doleful night was dark—Oh! what ensu'd To him who felt this grievous solitude; When all the pow'rs of Death and Hell combin'd Their terrors to afflict his suff'ring mind. Retiring from his friends, and prostrate low On the cold earth, in agonizing woe With grief intense he calls, O Father, hear, Let me escape this trial most severe! The bitter cup, if possible, remove, If not, thy will be done, Oh God of love!— Thrice in his woe he from th' Apostles turn'd, And in an agony of sorrows mourn'd; In such a storm of grief his soul was tost, That all his nervous pow'rs their strength had lost; When sweat like drops of blood (oh! awful stream) From ev'ry pore bedew'd his sacred frame. Satan beheld the conflict, gladly saw Exhausted Nature sink beneath the law; When lo! from Heav'n an Angel swiftly came To comfort Christ, who bore the grief and shame Of sin, a world of sin, he then sustain'd,— Th' iniquity of all on him remain'd. Refresh'd by aid divine, he then return'd To his Apostles, whom he gently warn'd Of what was near; but sleep had them o'ercame— Sleep on he said, and rest your weary frame. But oh! the time is come, the Christ betray'd, And by his blood Man's ransom shall be paid.— Scarce had he spoke when Judas with a band Of Soldier's arm'd, by the High Priest's command Enter'd the garden, furiously rude, Attended by the clam'rous multitude, Who (tho' they'd late ador'd) by malice taught To scorn the Miracles by Jesus wrought, With wild mistaken zeal, his life now sought. So leaps the hungry tyger on his prey, His foaming jaws and fiery eyes dismay The spotless victim, who a sacrifice Falls unrepining, suffers, bleeds, and dies. CHAP. II. The throng to Jesus press'd with hasty feet, When he with calmness did their insults meet; Then ask'd them whom they sought,—awhile o'ercame By pow'r divine, they shrunk in silent shame; Again he ask'd,—when Jesus, they reply'd,— Their strength then fail'd, nor could their purpose guide. Appall'd, they trembling fell upon the ground, While Horror spread her gloomy influence round, Nor durst they rise, that sacred face to view, Which precious tears of mercy did bedew. Then had they gladly left this impious deed, Had not the Tempter urg'd them to proceed, For he had enter'd Judas' treach'rous breast Who now advanc'd, and Jesus thus address'd— Hail, Master! hail, then gave the faithless kiss A sign intended to defeat the bliss For Man prepar'd—thus did the Fiend devise His fruitless wiles, to make his empire rise: Alas! how weak, how futile, and how vain, Like modern Infidels, who rather strain The falsest tales than own a Saviour's reign. As the Messiah knew the inmost thought Of his pursuers, and whom 'twas they sought, That they were thirsting for his precious life, Striving to wound the healer of all strife, After his word their hearts with fear had fill'd And made their cruelty to pity yield, Inspir'd by the Infernal they renew'd Their rankling rage, and with revenge pursu'd Man's heav'nly friend— Thus when the caprice of a giddy throng Claims as a fav'rite work a maxim wrong, Not even reason can their rage restrain, But folly triumphs in their madd'ning brain. The mob tumult'ous, thro' the crafty wiles Of their abettors, heeded not the smiles Of the Redeemer, nor the sweet discourse, Which flow'd from him to give those smiles due force; But with rude clamour seiz'd him instantly, While oaths and execrations rent the sky. When thus the Christ,—What! are ye come with swords And staves to take me, why not when my words You daily heard within your holy dome, Oh! why not then? but now, the time is come. Yet know ye now, if I resistance chose Heav'n's panoply would soon confound my foes: Not all th' united pow'rs of human art Would aught avail;—but I fulfil the part My Father hath assign'd.— This said, the Soldiers dragg'd him to the hall, Where Priests and Elders waited for his fall, Prepar'd with subtle artifice they came, By falshood witnesses subborn'd, to frame A tale,—to prove his guilt—alas! indeed, It is for Man's vile guilt he's doom'd to bleed!— Prejudg'd, he came, a spectacle of woe, But first must to th' ambitious Annas go; Mean while with mockeries and scoffing smile The poor deluded zealots him revile. Night now return'd, but Jesus by a guard Of common Soldiers was from rest debarr'd; No pitying heart his innocence admir'd,— The Officers and Priests to sleep retir'd On beds of down;—for him they found no bed Nor ev'n the means to rest his sacred head; While nought but tumult 'midst the impious sound Of vilest execrations him surround. Thus pass'd the tedious hours—at length the Sun In orient splendor his bright race begun; But how his face with conscious blushes glow'd, To see his great Creator's weary load; Who bearing all the ills since guilt began Was made the sport,—the scorn of sinful Man. Cai'phas at dawn of day with solemn state, Ascended what was call'd the holy seat Of Justice, but alas! that sacred name Chican'ry's wiles too often does defame. Near this tribunal Christ's accusers stood, Nor heeded how, so they could spill his blood. The priestly Annas with his stately train (A train too ready temp'rals to maintain) First him arraign'd, with them the rulers join'd Ev'n hoary Elders in their charge combin'd.— Silent Christ stands, amidst their envious spleen, Secure in innocence, with mind serene, And hears himself accus'd of various crimes Which ignorance and malice of the times Had falsely urg'd—nor further they proceed, But others find to do the impious deed. Two then appear'd, whom truth had ne'er adorn'd, Whom these flagitious Hypocrites subborn'd By many gifts, and swore,—this Man has said Should desolation o'er the temple spread; That in three days he'll build its walls again— These are the works this boaster does maintain. Thus when a court vile Sycophants surround, An upright Magistrate is seldom found; For the High Priest tho' stil'd a Judge supreme, Let furious rage his sacred office shame. Vex'd that the wav'ring multitude before With loud Hosannas should the Christ adore, And fraught with envy, stifled ev'ry ray Of light, to give revenge its hateful sway.— Now Satan long had roam'd about the earth, Striving to blast the bless'd Redeemer's birth,— That busy restless Fiend had often try'd To tempt the Lord, and cunningly apply'd His artful stratagems, with curious skill To make him fall subservient to his will. But vain each effort—oft as he assail'd The Saviour Christ, as oft his wiles had fail'd. Yet still led on by his unbounded pride To gain success, his arts once more he try'd, For he unseen had enter'd ev'ry court, And to the heart of Annas did resort, 'Till in it he awak'd that furious zeal. Which never sinks till blood is made the seal.— In private conference the Priests now meet, And Pilate chose, their purpose to compleat, A governor, as cruel as his lord Tiberius, for his vices much abhorr'd: But Pilate, tho' so wicked, long time strove, With caution, how he judg'd the Lord of love; Nay, said, from all the accusations heard, He would release him—for no guilt appear'd. When the Priests heard the Roman's lenient views, Declaring Jesus faultless to the Jews, With all the cunning of that crafty tribe, They made the Governor fresh thoughts imbibe. Then proofs of treason deep they forthwith bring That Jesus had proclaim'd himself a King; And had usurp'd that glory—due to none But mighty Cæsar, could he this charge shun? That while he exercis'd the Roman laws, His duty bound to aid his master's cause.— Thus with much cunning and delusive art They quickly sway'd the Judge's wav'ring heart; Who then in haste tho' Christ he own'd so pure, Commanded that he scourging should endure: This said, th' obedient Soldiers shew'd their zeal, Nor dar'd they from the stern command appeal. The deep'ning furrows on his back were found, The quiv'ring flesh display'd each ghastly wound; Fast streams the blood,—the purple veins are tore His holy frame is stain'd with clotted gore.— At length the Soldiers, weary'd out, forbear;— But to inflict fresh tortures now prepare, A crown of thorns upon his head they plac'd, A fictious sceptre too his hand disgrac'd; Then in derision round their God they vaunt, And bow'd the knee, they hail him King, and taunt With cruel spleen: to these indignities They added buffetting and veil'd his eyes; While young and old around him jeering cry, Who is it strikes thee? prithee prophecy? Then striking on the crown, the scornful crown, From ev'ry vein the blood came trickling down. Mov'd to behold this Man of griefs and woe, Pilate relax'd again, would pity shew; And sought while mercy triumph'd in his mind To rescue him, who came to save Mankind. Full well he knew the custom of the Jews At th' yearly feast he dar'd not to refuse, Which was, to grant a pardon free to one Who stood convicted: thus he meant to shun The cruel deed, and therefore brought out two, A Murderer one, the other to their view Was the Messiah, wounded, faint, and pale, Then cry'd aloud, let innocence prevail; Behold the guiltless object of your rage, And let his woes your cruelty asswage; Say, whom shall I release, whom shall I bring, Barabbas? no, much rather Christ your King. Those being prepar'd who had prejudg'd his death, Cry'd, in one voice, as prompted by one breath, We have no king but Cæsar—thus they rag'd, And then the mob to turbulence engag'd; Release Barabbas—give us him they cry'd, But for the Christ, let him be crucify'd.— Unmanly cowardice then shook the soul Of Pilate, in whose breast more terrors roll, Lest that the Jews should prejudice his name, And brand him with disgracing Cæsar's fame; So gave up Christ to death with feign'd consent, Altho' he had declar'd him innocent: Then free'd a wretch, both Murderer and Thief,— But yet to give his tortur'd mind relief Call'd out for water, and declar'd aloud, Christ was condemn'd to satisfy the croud; Then wash'd his hands, bidding all witness bear, That in his spotless blood he had no share.— The giddy throng made answer 'twas their act, Nor would they ever disavow the fact; Then all as one, yet bound themselves far worse, And rent the air with this most horrid curse, His blood be on us and our race— A horrid imprecation, black as hell, Invoking ills which after them befell. Those who for ages had distinguish'd shone The glory and the dread of ev'ry one, To whom God had appear'd from Heav'n above, In pow'r, in wisdom, justice, mercy, love; Who sent his Seers to teach their chiefest good In prophecies they all well understood; That those who ev'ry day had seen the Lord Display his wonders, heard his healing word, Should so far lose their reason to prefer Before him, both a Thief and Murderer; The Roman Judge to take his life t'inflame Cursing posterity, with blackest shame, Appalls the soul, and hence let mortals know, From raging tumult, justice cannot flow. CHAP. III. Thus far had Satan toil'd with boiling rage, Nor could the deadliest woes his hate asswage, But the Messiah spitefully pursues To aid the malice of the envious Jews; Yet like to stones when thrown against the wall, Which oft with fury on the slinger fall, So Satan's schemes pursu'd with so much toil, Did on his head with tenfold rage recoil. Tho' he had gain'd the Judge, Christ to condemn, And made his dearest friends his woes contemn And flee away, yea more his name deny With execrations too his works defy: Tho' now deliver'd to the raging throng, Who like a torrent hurry'd him along, And brought him fainting to the cursed tree, Quite void of that sublime solemnity Which does th' affecting scene of death attend, And tho' their tongues almost the Heavens rend With crucify, the Monarch to us bring, We'll crucify that false pretending King;— Yet 'midst of torture, clamour, taunts, and woe, Christ rose triumphant o'er our deadly foe. With wounds unheal'd, fill'd with malicious strife While streams of blood flow'd from the Lord of life, The Jews compel him now to bear the cross (Doom'd to retrieve our first and fatal loss) Thro' crouds of people gather'd to the feast, And as their spleen, his torture sore increas'd; He reels and staggers o'er the stony road, He faints, he falls, beneath the pond'rous load. Tho' Priests and Elders who at Pilate's call Attended the procession, saw him fall; Regardless of his anguish, all their care Was to procure a stranger, fit to bear The cross to Calvary— So blind we move, when reason's brightest ray Is overcome, and fury leads the way. As they approached near the city gate Where thousands did with sighs and sorrows wait To view their Saviour's wounds, which they deplor'd In useless tears,—all that they could afford To ease his griefs,—when to them thus bespake Their pitying God:—Oh! weep not for the sake Of my sad ills, but rather mourn your own And children's, for the time will soon be known Which tender Nature shudders to relate, When war and tumult shall o'erwhelm your state: In all its horror, famine too shall reign, Yea in the great extremity of pain, Of furious hunger crimes ye will abett, And all the fond endearing ties forget, Which anxious parents to their offspring bear, Whose infant charms will only aid despair. In this distress which I to you foreshew, Happy are those who barrenness shall know, And blest those breasts which never gave relief To harmless sucklings,—such will be your grief That clad in dire amaze to caves you'll run, Afraid to view the brightness of the Sun; Yea, then such dreary horrors will unite, The hills you will invoke at the sad sight To fall to hide you from th' Eternal's might. With weary steps our Saviour now ascends The mountain's height, there to compleat the ends Of Man's redemption: Calv'ry! I thee view With op'ning scenes of joy and wonder too; From thy exalted name made sacred now, Jesus the Lord fulfills his holy vow: The distant isles repeat the welcome sound, From Calvary is now Salvation found. The fatal tree now on the mountain rear'd, The Paschal Lamb's the offering prepar'd, Who calmly waited the impending blow, The executioner inflicts with woe. Like as the butcher with unfeeling mind, The harmless victim does for slaughter bind, Nor lets his pleading looks his eyes engage, But heedless strikes the blow with brutal rage. E'en so the monster did his ills prepare— Christ's graceful body he extends in th' air; Then on the tree wide spreads his holy arms, And thro' the sinews of his sacred palms With cruel force the tort'ring nail he strikes, And thro' his feet fierce drives the harden'd spikes. Thus fasten'd was the Lord in great distress, Yet as the Serpent in the wilderness Was lifted up as Jesus had foretold, So he was rear'd that all might him behold. Yea, tho' he was between two culprits plac'd, Whence ignominious censure might be trac'd; Their wrath fulfill'd the Scripture without flaw,— He's number'd with transgressors of the law. Confirm'd in guilt, with conduct vilely base, Again the impious Pilate shew'd his face, And to give colour to his unjust laws On the rear'd cross inserts th' offending clause, “Jesus of Naz'reth Monarch of the Jews,” That by the title he might guilt infuse.— What wretched art, Pilate proclaim'd him free, Spotless, and one wherein no fault could be; Tho' he had heard from Christ his holy case, Would stigmatize him with the worst disgrace; But he whose merits are to heal and bless, Tho' now enwrapt in languishing distress, Blasphem'd by all, yet still the God we view, Father forgive,—these know not what they do! The dark and dismal hour now drawing on When the Messiah must for sin atone For sinful Man—in misery immers'd His fever'd blood brings on a deadly thirst. Thus he by whom Creation was display'd, Whose wisdom earth, sea, air, and all things made, In dying agony so far was spent, That in the bitter hour of languishment He cry'd, I thirst— Th' inhuman Jews attended at his call, And gave him mingled, vinegar with gall; Such was their pity—nor could those accord, Those guilty Thieves, who suffer'd with the Lord, The one with harden'd guilt dar'd him upbraid, The other thus besought his Saviour's aid.— O gracious Lord! take pity on my soul, And cleanse me of my sins, most vile and foul; With heart-felt grief and sorrow I bewail My wicked life, let not thy goodness fail Me, tho' a wretched sinner, set me free, My suff'ring Lord, my God remember me! To whom the dying Jesus thus reply'd,— As thou with faith hast on my pow'r rely'd, That benediction I this instant seal Which all sincere repentant sinners feel— Be happiness secur'd within thy breast, Receive the promise of eternal rest. Now round the Christ increasing tortures flow, The moment of accumalated woe, The pow'rs of Sin, of Death, and Hell attend, Distress and pain his soul with anguish rend; Forsaken and forlorn, not one to pour One ray of comfort in this dreadful hour; His chosen Twelve, whom he secur'd from harm, Were all dispers'd, with terror and alarm; And in th' extreme of this dejected state, Abandon'd by the Godhead, then the weight Of all the human guilt upon him lay, This was the grievous debt he came to pay In infinite distress—all comfort fail'd When in this crisis sad he thus bewail'd:— “Eli, Eli, lama sabacthana?” “My God, my God, hast thou forsaken me?” For Man's eternal bliss on earth I came, To ransom him I suffer grief and shame; And now 'tis finish'd, holy Jesus cry'd, Then meekly bow'd his sacred head and dy'd. CHAP. IV. The holy Virgin and the much lov'd John, With great fatigue approach'd the cross, whereon The Saviour hung, and just before the Lord Had finish'd Man's Redemption, ere the word Had been pronounc'd which seal'd the deed of love, And ratify'd Man's claim to bliss above, They had beheld his agony and pain, Nor could their eyes the flowing tears retain; Yet while they look'd on him with piercing grief, His words replete with love convey'd relief. Thus have I seen a Rustic full of fears Surrounded by his family in tears, A prey to grief—by poverty depress'd, Ev'n hope has ceas'd to animate his breast: When lo! Benevolence with lovely grace Appears to charm his tortur'd mind to peace, Removes each ill, tho' heighten'd by despair, Relieves their wants and soothes the Parent's care. The holy Lord his Mother thus addrest,— O woman! set thy anxious soul at rest: No more shall fears thy tender frame annoy, Behold me now the pledge of future joy. Those pleasing raptures which have fill'd thy breast, Those sweet endearing cares thy love exprest, Are now no more,—I came here to fulfill The holy Scriptures and thy Maker's will; For Man I triumph'd over Satan's hate,— To save Mankind, I took his lowly state, Became an Infant, object of thy love, Nor canst thou that solicitude remove Which tender mothers for their off'spring know, Yet let those useless tears forget to flow; For Man shall be restor'd to joys sublime, Then wait with resignation for the time, Which soon shall find accomplishment in me, My Birth, my Life, my Death, shall set you free But see my lov'd Apostle and my friend, With filial duty he shall thee attend; Be he thy future son, let mutual love Heart-breaking sorrow far away remove. And thou Disciple, much belov'd receive Thy mother to thy care, her woes relieve: Be her support, her failing spirits aid, And in this trying scene be not dismay'd: Soon shall you see me on the earth again, Triumphant o'er mortality and pain. Then will I fill thy soul with ev'ry ray Of grace divine, while thou shalt truths display, Which to pure virtue and true pleasure tend, To happiness supreme, which ne'er shall end. This said, he cry'd—Oh, Father, comfort me, I now commit my spirit unto thee! Then shook the whole Creation with his woes, And earth her beauteous order seem'd to lose, Tremendous scenes unequall'd terror spread, And from the graves came forth th' awaken'd dead, The Temple's vail was rent—the conscious Sun, As if the sight of human guilt to shun, Withdrew his genial beams, withheld his light, All Nature wore the awful gloom of night; The universal horrors which ensu'd, With wond'ring dread the distant nations view'd. While unenlighten'd Gentiles trembling stand And think earth's dissolution is at hand, Not ev'n the convert Jews know where to rest Their hope by fear, their faith by doubt represt; Long the delusive thought they had retain'd, That Christ in worldly splendor would have reign'd, That he to Judah wou'd have brought relief From foreign tyranny, and thus their grief Had been no more; alas! to follies giv'n, For earth they almost lost their care for Heav'n. Others unmindful of the great event In careless indolence their moments spent, Join'd the foul stream tradition pour'd along, Nor sought to be convinc'd if right or wrong The Scriptures told, whether obscure or clear They pointed out, or when Christ should appear. Oh! wou'd they read those books with that concern They ponder earthly deeds, they soon would learn Conviction, faith and love, true hope and joy, Nor would perplexing doubt their minds annoy. The prophet Daniel does the time declare When the Messiah should his suff'rings bear; And Zechariah has expressly told The sum for which he was betray'd and sold. But when Isaiah in majestic strains Describes his Birth, his Life, and dying Pains; How can they doubt those truths to them reveal'd, As tho' the Prophet had his God beheld. Who can these oracles explore, unmov'd, Where Man's Salvation is so clearly prov'd. But, ah! the Jews, like Christians now indeed, Esteem their Bibles, but they seldom read! Nor e'er compare th' Evangelist and Seer, Where num'rous types to end their doubts appear; Which would they do, those types they might explain, And find fulfill'd in the Messiah's reign. The hardy Guards now took the sad alarm, Heart-sinking fear did all the soul disarm; The light'ning's livid flash deep terror spread, The thunder's awful sound increas'd their dread, The night's dark gloom o'ercame meridian light, And long try'd valour yielded at the sight. But that some shew of courage might appear, Or they might gain dismission from their care, They then approach'd the Mount with falt'ring tread, And broke the culprits legs, but found Christ dead. On him they then forbore the useless stroke, For Scripture faith, his bones shall not be broke; Yet one who was on this dire task employ'd, Whose fear had not his cruelty destroy'd, With wanton rage to cowardice ally'd, Advanc'd his spear and pierc'd the Saviour's side. The purple flood stream'd torrents on the ground, And blood and water mingled in the wound. Here stands the bulwark, here the Christian's fence, The Adamah, the First, the Last, from whence Springs love to Man,—this is the glorious prize The pure oblation, and the sacrifice Once offer'd, ever saving Man from doom, The oath to shew his death until he come, The Covenant, Baptismal Jordan's stream, The holy Eucharist, the vow supreme!— Eternal God thy mercies I adore, O aid me, Truth Divine! while I explore Thy wond'rous works; oh grant, Almighty Lord, My pen, my heart, and life may all accord To shew thy praise, how thy great goodness will'd To have each tittle of thy law fulfill'd; And may thy wond'rous mercy Man engage To find Salvation in the sacred page. Now while the tragic scene made pity reign, One of the Sanhedrim went forth to gain Christ's sacred body of the Roman Chief; And, his consent receiv'd, with pious grief He took it down, and with a solemn gloom Repos'd it in a new and spacious tomb. When fix'd in wrath, the Leaders of the Jews, Their malice to relinquish yet refuse; To the High Priest with hasty steps they go, But all was discord, anarchy and woe. The glory of the Shekinah was fled, The beauty of the Israelites was dead; In vain did Caiaphas assume the chair, In vain he now commands attention there; Increasing numbers tumults more increase, And restless Satan almost su'd for peace. To hush their various clamours he forsook His outward terrors, then himself betook, With all the venerable form and grace— The mild resemblance of a Rabbi's face; Then for admission to the Priest he sues, Who vainly still endeavour'd to reduce The throng to order, but as soon he'd gain Both peace and order from the raging main. At length the arch-deceiver struggled through The num'rous multitude, and gain'd the view Of Caiaphas; then in his ear instill'd Revenge and falshood,—yea, his bosom fill'd With rankling envy, hinting that the friends Of Christ would steal him, to promote their ends; Then would report abroad in artful strain, That he their glorious Lord had rose again. Th' attentive Priest in thoughtful silence heard, Approv'd, and by a sign his friends prepar'd, For private conf'rence—who with him retir'd To learn what new concurrence was requir'd. He then unfolds the scheme—they orders send Commission'd with his name one to attend The Roman Judge, that Soldiers might be sent To frustrate what Christ's friends would now invent. Thus were produc'd by the malicious Jews Those strong convincing proofs that so conduce To fix the Christian's Faith, had not they sought A Guard of Pilate, they with mischief fraught Had form'd a tale whose plausible pretext The early converts might have much perplext. Pilate at once comply'd with their request, He thought it prompted by a skilful breast; The Watch was fix'd, the Sepulchre made sure, A stone of pond'rous weight secur'd the door. Yea, that no plan their prudence might defeat, They seal'd it with the signet of the state; But what is human soresight, what avails The seal, the pond'rous stone when justice fails? What are the hardy vet'rans when they stand Against Jehovah's all victorious hand? For at th' appointed time the trembling earth Display'd his wond'rous might who'd given birth To all this spacious globe: her horrid shocks Sent forth dismay, and rent the stony rocks: When lo! the Spirit of the Lord descends From Heav'n, attended by an host of friends— Angelic friends, who gladly him surround, To see Omniscience sin and death confound. Oh, Death, where is thy sting! thy triumphs Grave! Now all thy gloomy terrors thou must leave; Behold the great Messiah reassumes His sacred form which vivid life illumes; Christians may well admire the glorious deed, That Resurrection which lost Man has freed. This is the joyful day the Saviour sends, On this Man's hope, on this his life depends; The Heav'ns resound with praise, th' angelic throng With harps celestial, sing the glorious song, None but th' Eternal Godhead e'er could plan Returning love, returning love to Man; Christ the first-fruits, the chains of Death has broke, And Man's recover'd from the Serpent's yoke: Christ shews the world that as he rose again, Triumphant over Death, o'er Hell and pain; So Man to Immortality shall rise,— So Man in triumph shall ascend the skies. CHAP. V. Let Christians now the Hallelujah sing To Christ the Lord, the God, the heavenly King; Let thankful praise be heard thro' all the earth, For the Messiah gives Salvation birth. What glorious change to sinful Man appears To guide him happy thro' this vale of tears; The Buffetters are fled, the Rulers gone, And those who shame and misery put on The Holy Christ, now lie entranc'd as dead, Nor is there one who dares to raise his head. For this great scene did all the Watch confound,— With wild affright they leave the usual bound Of their allotted duty, and return To the High Priest, who fill'd with much concern, Beheld them trembling with unusual dread, While broken sentences the tidings spread That Christ was ris'n,—that round them shone such light As with amazement long o'ercame their sight, That while they wond'ring fell upon the ground; T' escape those terrors which did them surround,— The trembling earth shook horribly and seem'd As tho' her womb with dissolution teem'd;— That then they found the Tomb where Christ was laid Wide open, and the stone which fast was made Remov'd, altho' secur'd by Pilate's seal, But how effected they could not reveal. Have you not seen the anxious Parent stand To see his son approach his native strand, With longing eyes he views the boist'rous main, The ship appears which all his joys contain; When lo! a sudden storm dispels delight, And all his joys are gone to endless night: No more his hopes rise with the rising gale, The prospect chills his soul, his spirits fail. So stood the Priest in fancy quite secure, But how could happiness like his endure? He vainly vaults in pride, his counsel giv'n He thought was worthy all the bliss of Heav'n. Alas! when blind delusion warps the mind, Hypocrisy can Virtue's semblance find,— A moment's calm had lull'd his soul to rest, But when the Centinels their tale exprest, His boasted stratagems at once gave way, And to despair himself had been a prey, Had not the Prince of darkness sought again With ev'ry art, to prop his tott'ring reign. For he with Caiaphas being closely leagu'd, Assur'd him that the Soldiers were fatigu'd With over watching, and no doubt requir'd Refreshment oft, this thought the Priest admir'd— 'Twas true such horrors had disturb'd the night, As would ev'n more than human beings fright; The lightning's vivid flash—the thunder's roar Had scarce been equall'd on the earth before. Th' officious Sanhedrim again attend On the High Priest, their counsellor and friend; He tells the plan his intimate had shewn, But they must make the active part their own; Then bids them try with artful bribes to gain The Watch, this grand imposture to maintain. Thus by their Chief these misled zealots taught, The Centinels with eager care they sought; Laugh'd at their doubts, o'erwhelm'd their sense in wine, And when the copious draught made fear resign Her station in their lately failing breast, Then thus the subtile train themselves exprest:— The terrors of the night might well prevent Your seeing Jesus' followers intent; For while o'ercome with sleep and care you lay, They mov'd the stone, and took the corpse away, That all would be convinc'd this tale was true, Since none the fraud could e'er expose to view; And Jews and Romans well were satisfy'd Th' Impostor had been punish'd for his pride. Then added they, tho' you in duty fail, No punishment or danger shall assail Your want of prudence,—only well accord, And we will recompence with great reward. This said, with gifts they ev'ry fear remov'd, And to their will, the Watch obedient prov'd.— Such lights appear the Christian faith to prove, Which no base frauds or falshoods can remove. The Priest's commands deliver'd with design To stifle truth, more lovely made it shine. If the Guards knew what happen'd while they slept, Why had not they the sacred body kept? How could they know, while they all prostrate were, As their new tale confess'd, with sleep and care, Who took the body, yet if that they knew, Why not attempt those robbers to subdue? Of all Christ's num'rous friends, but one was found, Who dar'd to raise his hand, to give a wound; And after that his courage did subside, And with vile oaths he thrice his Lord deny'd. When all were scatter'd round thro' grief and fear, Was he the head to bring those cowards near T' encounter Soldiers, arm'd with sword and spear? Oh, holy Father! ever just and true, Let full conviction ev'ry mind subdue, To taste thy glorious Truths, that bliss divine, The fountain where thy mercies ever shine. Such mighty deeds could not remain conceal'd,— Th' Apostles heard, and the glad news reveal'd That Christ was ris'n, which spread from friend to friend, And made their timid apprehensions end. Ev'n Thomas, tho' so full of doubting pride, Unless he saw his Master's wounded side, And thrust his hand therein, had not believ'd, Receiv'd those proofs, and knew that Jesus liv'd.— The great Messiah on the earth again Appear'd triumphant over Death and pain; And with his much-lov'd friends behold him stand, Giving this holy, pure, and just command:— Go forth and teach the various nations round, I give you pow'r all evils to confound; Let Baptism be perform'd on ev'ry coast In name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For now the great partition wall is broke, And all are freed from th' heavy Jewish yoke; The Holy Spirit shall descend in sight, And spread conviction clear as morning light; Those beauteous truths which mysteries conceal, To all the Gentile world he will reveal; And tho' the time—the joyful time is come, Which now restores me to my heav'nly home, Be not afraid, for tho' from you I go, I've put on grief, and cloath'd myself with woe; And your frail nature took to set you free, Thus all have found accomplishment in me. Yet 'till I go, the Comforter on you Will not descend, but when his pow'r you know He'll be your wisdom, spirit, strength, and guide, And shew you paths from whence you shall not slide. Then cease from grief, my absence ne'er bewail, I carry with me your Redemption's seal; And ye, my brethren, who believe and love, Shall one day join th' angelic choir above; And ye who doubt my saving grace repent, So shall ye endless misery prevent. Remember this— Salvation is complete, its purchase paid, No more you'll want the smoaking altar's aid, No sacrifice, or offer'd blood takes place, New moons and all your vain oblations cease. No other merits come before the throne But mine, and for your sins they shall atone. When I go hence I will this body take An earnest that from Death you shall awake; Then will the Heav'ns declare Jehovah's praise, And sing the wonders of his glorious ways; Millions of millions will in joy accord, To sing of Man's Redemption, Man restor'd. The Cherubim and Seraphim divine, Who in the radiant robes of glory shine, And who eternal honours pay their King, Of Man restor'd shall then exulting sing;— Shall sing of Justice, with sweet Mercy join'd— Shall sing of Love, display'd to all Mankind. Such were the comforts the Messiah gave His lov'd Apostles, e'er he took his leave; Thus he convers'd, immaculate, and pure, And thus set forth the wretched Sinner's cure; 'Till the great day of his Ascension came, When with the Brethren to the Mount of Fame Call'd Olives, he repair'd, where shining rays Of glory beam'd around the Lord of Praise. His lov'd Disciples now a num'rous band, With awe and admiration silent stand; While holy Angels fill'd th' expanse of Heav'n, And throng'd to hear our Saviour's blessing giv'n.— With tender love his arms he did extend, Farewell, he cry'd, my brethren, I ascend The throne of Grace,—in love and kindness live, Freely ye have receiv'd, as freely give. The holy bond, sweet peace, I leave with you, Then 'midst refulgent light in glory flew To his bright mansion, blessing as he rose, While Angels did this joyful Hymn compose. Now worthy is the Lamb to reign supreme, And to receive all honour to his name; The holy Lamb of God, the Sacrifice, Has Man receiv'd as his redeemed prize: He is th' accepted Sacrifice for all, Who have offended by first Adam's fall: All Men on Earth join, join the holy theme, Let love, let gratitude, his works proclaim. CHAP. VI. The Friends of the Messiah much amaz'd To see him rise, still on the Heavens gaz'd; And did with reverential awe receive The gracious Benediction which he gave. They saw how the Angelic Host ador'd, And homage paid to Christ th' ascending Lord. Such wond'rous scenes were ne'er display'd before, Nor shall again, 'till time shall be no more. The whole expanse appear'd exceeding bright, And far surpass'd the Sun's meridian light; The sacred path in Jacob's vision known, Where the Angelic Host in glory shone, Was now again with heav'nly Spirits lin'd, Who to their harps celestial voices join'd. Th' harmonious strains were with such raptures sung, As struck with silence ev'ry human tongue; When to the throng two Angels were display'd, Who in celestial splendor were array'd, And to the Wonderers spake— Ye Men of Galilee, why stand ye here, Your Lord ascends from this sublunar sphere, To those bright regions of eternal day, To fix the seal of Man's redemptive plea; He now assumes the sceptre of the world, And sin and guilt are into chaos hurl'd; He is the King of Kings, his eye surveys The infinite expanse. Oh! can you raise Your thoughts, to trace his wonderful decrees,— 'Tis he who calms the raging of the seas: His pow'r gives life and breath to ev'ry soul, Th' eternal King illuminates the whole. And now that long expected great event Is finish'd by Omnipotent consent: This is that stay which hope to Man has giv'n, And which with bliss has fill'd the highest Heav'n, Transcending all description, much too great For the weak limits of your mortal state— To comprehend it—we have always strove The theme employ'd our wonder, praise, and love— It has employ'd the whole Angelic throng, And joyful strains have flow'd from ev'ry tongue, E'er since this wond'rous Covenant began, When great Jehovah it decree'd for Man, And fix'd his restoration— Thus Angels gloried in the lovely theme Of Man restor'd to happiness supreme, They then proceeded— The subject of Creation shews what store Of goodness reigns with God for evermore; It proves his pow'r and wisdom infinite, And all are fill'd with wondering delight; Yet in Redemption further we explore, Man's lost condition nothing could restore, But an atonement, equal to the fall,— No other way could raise him from his thrall. Then Truth and Justice arm'd with sov'reign might, With Wisdom, Love, and Mercy did unite In perfect reconcilement,—'tis this theme Which Angels and Archangels now proclaim. But now the joyful time is nigh at hand, The Holy Ghost will make you understand, When ev'ry tongue inspir'd with truth divine, Shall tell the world how God's great mercies shine. Shall mortals teach that penitence and prayer For the last Judgment must their Souls prepare. When this fix'd earth shall agitated heave, And flinty rocks their harden'd substance leave; When this vast globe shall be by fire consum'd, And then the Dead by Life shall be illum'd, The mighty ocean which so long has roll'd Within unfathom'd depths, shall then unfold Those gloomy caverns,—from his oozy bed Shall rise whole myriads of awaken'd dead, All summon'd by th' Archangels solemn call, Nor shall a single hair unnumber'd fall. In that great day, high arm'd with pow'r and might, The Christ Messiah will assume his right Of conquest, which his gracious love alone O'er Death, o'er Hell and Sin for mortals won. This said—the Angels join'd the heavenly train, Nor could the wond'ring croud from thanks refrain; But with loud praise proclaim'd what real joys Inspire the mind which gratitude employs. Th' Apostles gladden'd by the promis'd grace Of heav'nly comfort, left this sacred place, And in bright Salem met in fervent pray'r, To supplicate Jehovah's watchful care. With them abundance of the brethren join'd, Glowing with sentiments of love refin'd; Each day they pass'd in breaking holy bread, And on the Bread of Life they daily fed. The day of Pentecost was now at hand, When met by one consent, the holy band To praise and pray—when on a sudden came A sound like wind, join'd by an heav'nly flame. Then was fulfill'd our Saviour's words I go, Yet tho' I leave you,—grief you shall not know; The Comforter shall come, his heav'nly rays Will you instruct, and teach you how to praise. Oh wond'rous pow'r! miraculous the sign, When God the Holy Ghost appear'd divine To be their guide, while they with knowledge fill'd, Began t' expound and preach as tho' long skill'd In all the languages, both new and old, And to each tongue God's wonders they unfold. The poor illiterate Fisherman is seen With noble courage and with mind serene, Discoursing, and confounding all that strove By calumny the wonder to remove. Mean time his untaught brother prophecies, And tells the secrets of th' ethereal skies; Another faith maintains,—while others heal— Others interpret,—none in knowledge fail. Where is the Scribe? where are the mighty wise? Those great disputers, dare ye claim the prize? Alas! the means to gain it ye neglect, With God your wisdom is of none effect; Redemption is compleat, these will maintain That holy myst'ry which you strive t' arraign.— Your plea is reason, can weak reason frame, The Attributes of your Creator's name? Or can you fathom what for Man is done, And Truth oppose which says these Three are One? Why does this wond'rous work appear so odd?— Th' acknowledg'd sign and token of a God Is knowing all our thoughts,—this potent sign In all his works prov'd Jesus was divine. Your Saviour says, (will not you him believe, Or will your doubt the Holy Spirit grieve?) The Comforter shall come,—then further told, And when He's come, He will all things unfold. All things unfold, can cavillers destroy Man's best, his dearest hope, of future joy? Who can unfold all things but very God, Whose mercy let's Man 'scape his scourging rod. And shall his wonders, boundless in extent, Be question'd by a worm, as tho' th' event Would follow at his call—untoward Man Jehovah's counsels thou canst never scan, In self rais'd fallacies engage no more, Go search the Scriptures, and thy God adore. The glorious Wonder being spread abroad Great numbers came, suspecting 'twas a fraud— T' expose the cheats,—but how were they amaz'd, When in all accents the Disciples rais'd Their praising voices, preaching th' holy word, How God to happiness had Man restor'd; Shewing that Jesus Christ of blessed name, Justice to satisfy, from Heav'n came, Our nature took to suffer on the Cross, To rescue Man condemn'd for Adam's loss. This said as with one heart they instant raise Their voice to God, in worship, love, and praise.— All praise and glory be to God on high, Ye men on earth his praises magnify! Let us rejoice and join with one accord To sing the boundless goodness of the Lord. For thy great mercies, oh thou heav'nly King, Father Almighty! we thy praises sing.— Oh Jesus Christ! thou pure begotton Son, Stupendous are the works which thou hast done; Thou holy Lamb, who sav'd us from the rod, Receive our praise for thou art ever God.— Oh Holy Ghost! the Comforter divine, Let thy refreshing Grace on Mortals shine; O holy God, to truth our minds engage, Thou great Inspirer of the Sacred Page! Oh holy Triune God! the Father, Son, And Holy Ghost, thou glorious Three in One, We thee, with wonder, love, and praise adore, Who was, and is, and shall be evermore! THE END.</field>
