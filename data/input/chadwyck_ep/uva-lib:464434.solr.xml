      <field name="fulltext">PREDICTIONS OF THE Overthrow of Popery, And the Landing of the Prince of Orange IN THE WEST: Written by George Wither Esquire, in the year 1660. And some Proposals for PERPETUAL PARLIAMENT Written by the same Author in 1652. To Act the last Scene which proceeds their Doom, They now new vampt upon the Stage are come; And, though that with the King, as if his Friends They seem to side, they come for other ends, Which he not yet discerning, in his Grace Vouchsafes them a considerable Place, And of prevailing they already boast, As if they saw the LAMB and all his Host Quite overthrown, which me as confident Hath made that God their proud hopes will prevent, And overthrow that Tyranny out-right, By what they Dream shall raise it to its height. But many Tryals must the Saints abide, And very much their patience will be try'd Here and elsewhere before that Act is done, Which with an Anti-mask is now begun. Our Friends inhabiting beyond the Waters, And who were of our Tragedy Spectators, Now Twenty years (though they perceive it not, Or seem not to perceive it) in that Lot Which these have cast for us, designed are (Or in what follows next) to have a share, For Hamans PURS on foot; not only here, But likewise almost every other where. And these think that to take them by his Gin, With most speed, is, with us first to begin. But there's a Counter-Mine, which will be sprung, To blowup them, and all their Mines e're long, &amp;c. ? wherein they see The Beasts late deadly wound nigh cur'd to be, They on a sudden, are become as Jolly, As if they thought it to be cured wholly; And, to impose their Mark, will now begin To be more strict than ever they have been; So that e're long, few men shall live in peace, Bear Office, or a free Estate possess Where they have power, unless they marked are In Hand, or Forehead, with their Character. But, if that, whereof some imperfect views Far off appear, accordingly ensues, There will to thwart their hopes, a new Star blaze Within the West, that shall the World amaze; And influences through the Universe So quickly, and prodigiously disperse, That, aided by concurring Constellations, It shall have some effects upon most Nations, And cause such changes, as will make a stand In those Attempts which they have now in hand. Yet know, it will but a diversion be, Not that which must from Bondage set us free. We, on this side the Water are not yet, Printed Anno 1652. Confus'd enough, that order to beget Which must establish us, and shall therefore Pursue Self-interest a little more. With new Wine our old Bottles must be fill'd, (Endangering Wine and Bottles to be spill'd) Till such as are in power be pleased to hear The Counsel of a slighted Engineer. With new Cloth our old Garments patcht must be, (Whereby the Rents made wider ye shall see) Till every old Rag be worn out, and then The Robe so rent shall be renew'd again. And they that own it, be secured more, And much more dignified, than heretofore. If they who must compleat it, make their choice By Lot divine, as well as humane voice. Whereto Self-seekers never will agree, Until enforced by some streights they be. Before the Sons of Jacob entrance found Into their Promis'd Land, they had a round, Or progress to fulfil, and many years They in the Desarts were Probationers, By several hardships, thereby to improve The Seeds of Faith, new sown at their remove From Egypt, and by Signs and Wonders shown To make unto themselves their frailties known. But they at each restraining of their Lust, Brake forth into repinings and distrust; Yea, into flat Rebellion, into rearing Of Idols (when his Law God was preparing) Into a wicked causless Murmuring Against the Means of their delivering From Egypt's Tryal, and into Wishes vain, That they might thither back return again For which of many hundred thousands none Enjoy'd the Promis'd Rest, but two alone. And we are just like them, yea, we have done, Since God, to bring us from our Thrall begun, The very same things in the Wilderness Of our Probation; and our Carcases Shall there be left, unless we do betimes Make an Attonement for our passed Crimes; And with unfeignedness that course pursue Which leads unto the Rest, that is in view, &amp;c. There is a course whereby, without disgrace, Or danger, you may bring that work to pass, And free your selves from that great cost and pain, Which without thanks or profit you sustain; Afflicting others too, by those Confusions Which are increast by your irresolutions. Until a better therefore shall appear, Be pleased that Expedient to hear, And by those preventions, or that good It promiseth, you find a likelihood, Take heed, that no self-interest, divert That approbation, whereunto your heart Inclineth you; for God will find you out, And cross the Counter-work you go about. In England and in Wales, there is a Shire, For ev'ry Week that's numbred in the year. By Twelve, according to the Months divide The Counties, with their Persons qualified For Knights and Burgesses, proportioning As near as may be, to an equalling The number of the whole, so, or so many Unto each Month, without omitting any. Ascertain then, the Month and Day, wherein Each twelfth part an Election shall begin; (The middle of the Week, appearing best, As being furthest from the day of Rest.) On each first Wednesday, of each Month, let those By whom our Deputies are to be chose, Respectively convene in ev'ry Shire, Upon that Month, and Wednesday ev'ry year, Which is to them assign'd; and having chosen, (At Months end) let each twelfth part, of the dozen, Send up their Chosen men, to represent Their Shires and Boroughs in the Parliament; And on that very Day, in which they come, Let all their Predecessors give them Room. Thus one Month some, and Month by Month for ever Let each twelfth part, still orderly persever To take a turn, till ev'ry Shire hath had A Month in ev'ry year; and having made Their choice, let them still enter and withdraw Successively by a perpetual Law, No man a place of Trust, supplying there, At one Election, longer than one year.
