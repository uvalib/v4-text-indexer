[Romance of Alexander the Great.] When folk ere festid &amp; fed fay? wald þai here Sum farand þing efter fode to fayn þare her[t], Or þai ware fourmed on fold or þaire fadirs oþer. Sum is leue to lythe þe lesing of Sayntis, Þat lete þer lifis be lorne for oure lordis sake; And sum has langing of lufe lays to herken, How ledis for þaire lemmans has langor endured. Sum couettis &amp; has comforth to carpe &amp; to lestyn Of curtaissy of kny?thode of craftis of armys, Of kyngis at has conquirid &amp; ouer-comy? landis. Sum of wirschip I-wis slike as þa? wyse lattis, And sum of wanto? werkis þa þat ere wild-hedid; Bot if þai wald o? many wyse a wondire ware it els; For as þaire wittis ere with-in so þer will folowis. And I forwith ?ow all ettillis to schewe Of ane Emperoure þe a?efullest þat euer armys hauntid, Þat was þe athill Alexsandire as þe buke tellis, Þat a?te euyn as his awy? all the werd ouire. For he recouerd quills he regnyd þe regions all clene, And all rialme &amp; þe riches in-to þe rede est. I sall rehers, &amp; ?e will, renkis rekyn ?our tongis, A remnant of his rialte &amp; rist quen vs likis. Oute in þe erth of Egipt enhabet vmquile Þe wysest wees of the werd as I in writt fynd. For þai þe mesure &amp; þe mett of all þe mulde couthe, Þe sise of all þe grete see &amp; of þe gry? wawys; Of þe ordere of þat odde home þat ouer þe aire hingis Knew þe kynd, &amp; þe curses of þe clere sternys, Of Articus the aghill tre airis &amp; oþire Of þe fold &amp; of þe firmament wele þe fete cuthe; And Antarticus also þat all apo? turnys, Þe pasage of þe planettis þe poyntis &amp; þe sygnes. Þai ware þe kiddest of þat craft knawyn i? þaire tyme, And þe sotellest vndere son segis i? þaire lyfe. Þus ware þai breued for þe best as þe buke tellis; All þai lerid of þat lare þat it lere wald. As wide as þe werd was went worde of þaire teching, Of sorsery &amp; slike werkis sle?tis enogh. And þe kyng of þat contre was a clerke noble, Þe athelest ane of þe werd &amp; Anec was hatten. He was wyse eno?e wirdis to reken, When he þe heuyn beheld of lede[s] opo? lyfe; Þe iapis of all gemetri gentilli he couth, And wele as Aristotill þe artis all seuyn. Þer preued neuer nane his prik for passing of witt, Plato nor Piktagaras ne Prektane him seluen. Emang his duykis on a day as he o? dese syttis, Þa? was him bodword vnblyth bro?t to þe sale, Þat Artaxenses was armed with þe men of his rewme, Þe proude king of Persy to pase him agay?. Þo?e he þa sawis herd say ?it samyd he na princis, Ne ost ordand he nane of na kyd kny?tis, Bot airis euen furth him ane &amp; entirs his chambre, To knaw by his clergi þe come of his faa. He takis a Boll of bras burneschid full clene, And full he fillis it of the flode at fell fra þe heuen. On hi?t in his a hand haldis a wand, And kenely be coniurisons callis to him spritis. In-to þis water as he waitis was he ware sone Of his enmys in þat Element ane endles nombre; He sa?e þa? in þe hi?e see sailand to-gedire, Was neuer sene slike a some vnder þe son bemys. Carrygis comand he knew keruand þe ithis, Dromonds dryfes ouer þe depe with dukis &amp; Erles, Gales &amp; grete schipis full of grym wapens, And full of breneid bernes bargis a hundreth, Of slik a naue is noy to here or to tell. For all þe largenes of lenth at he luke my?t, Slik was þe multitude of mast so mekil &amp; so thike, Þat all him þo?t bot he treis a hare wod it semyd. At þe enteris of Egipt as Anec had beden, Ware peris of his prouynce &amp; princes of his cytes, Was comandid of þaire kyng to kepe þa landis, Þat nane aproche it to paire of Persy ne othire. Þan was a warda? ware oute in þe wale stremys Of all þe naue &amp; þe note I neuenyd be-fore; La?t li?tly his ledis &amp; leuys his warde, Comes to courte to þe kyng &amp; o? kneys fallis, Anec bi his awyn name he onane gretis, Sais, “?are þe now ?apely or ?ild vp þi rewme; Artaxenses is at hand &amp; has ane ost reryd, And resyn vp with all his rewme to ride vs agay?; For he him-self is o? þe se with siche a somme armed, Þat any hathill vnder heue? ware hardy to rekyn. For þer is comy? with him kny?t[es] of landis dyuerse, Segis of many syde oute of sere remys, Þe perseyns &amp; a pupill þat parthy is callid, Men of Mesepotayme &amp; of Mede bathe, Of Syre &amp; of Sychim a selle nounbre, Of Capidos &amp; Caldec kene me? of armes, Fell fe?tand folke þat Faire we call, Þe Arrabiens &amp; all þa [of] þat origyne, Bernys out of Batary batails arayed, Aud oþire out of þe orient many od hundrethe.” Þen Anec onane ri?t efter þire wordis, A lowde la?ter he lo?e &amp; to þe lede said, “Haue þou na care,” quod þe kyng “bot kepe to þe marche, As I have demyd þe to do &amp; dred þou na ferryre; For soth it is vnsemely slike sawis of a prynce. I kan no?t knaw at þou carpis as a kny?t suld, Bot as a frek at ware ferid &amp; feynes ri?t nowe. Ert þou no?t hurtles &amp; hale? lat no?t þi hert faile. For vertu vailes no?t all if þou avaied worthe, Emang þe multitude of me? quare mane ere togeder, Bot þer aboute as þai ere blend with bignes of will. If þai be folke bot a fa oft tydis þam þe better. Or elis wate þou no?t wele þe witles berne, How it is comonly carped in contries a-boute, Þat anelepy leo? þat ouer þe land rynnys, Will make to fange to þe fli?t &amp; flay many hertis?” With þat þe segge all him selfe silis to his chambre, And in þe brasen boll full [of] blak watere He shapis him of shire wax litill schipis many, And ?apely ?arkid in his hand a ?erd of a palme. Þen co? he chater &amp; enchant with all his chefe mi?tis, A-vysid him in þe vessell &amp; was avaied sone, How þe powere out of Persy pellid doune his kny?tis, And how his land suld be lost withouten lett mare. When he was ware of þis wathe how it worthe suld, Þan wendis he wi?tly furth &amp; his wede changis, Clede him all as a clerke &amp; his croune shauys, And with a bytand blade he his bered voydis. Þen takis to him tresour &amp; trusses in baggis, As many Besandis o? his bake as he bere mi?t, And oþire necessari notis as nedis to his craftis, To sike salmary dangell as him self vyses. He toke traimmes him with to tute in þe sternes, Astralabus algate as his arte wald, Quadrentis coruen all of quyte siluyre full quaynte, Mustours &amp; mekil quat mare þen a littill. When he was graþed with his gere a gladen he waytis, And passis furþe at a Posterne preualy alane, Furþe on his fete withouten fole he passis his way, Vn-wetandly to any wee þat wont in his wanes. Þus airis he out of Egipte &amp; his erde leuys, Fled for ferd of his fais fere fra his kythis, It was na bote him to bide ne batill to ?elde; For all his kyngdome he knew suld be kast vnder. Fra þe partis of Persy he past bot a littill, And euyn so þur?e Ethyope &amp; þar hi? eft clethis, All his liche in lyn claþe for ledis suld trowe And all þe puple persayue a prophete he were. Þe? metis he furthe to Messado? full v?-mete gatis, And quen he come to þat kith as þe chance tellis, Oft with his instrumentis out he openly deuynes, And noþer hild he it ne hid bot here qua sa likid. Bot þan was methe for to mele þur?e men of his bur?, Þat he by-hind him at hame withoute hede leuyd. Slik care kindils in his curte quen þai þer kyng myssid, Þat it ware tere any tonge of þar tene to reken; Princes of his palas preses in-to chambre, To laite þar lord at was lost with latis vn-blythe; Kairis in-to closettis kny?tis &amp; Erlis, Sekand þar soueray? with many salt terys; Barons &amp; bachelers balefully gretis, Swiers swemyle swouned ladys, And many was þe bald berne at banned þar quile, Þat euer he dured þat day vndede opon erthe. Bot quen þai wist he was went &amp; wald no?t be foun, Couth þai na bote þa? ebland how best for to wirke, Bot silis to ser Sirraphis at sittis in his trone, Þat was þar god alþire-graythist o? þe ground samen. Him þai supplyed &amp; so?t &amp; him ensence castis, Honourd him with offyrings &amp; elkend him fayre, Þat he suld say þa? þe sothe &amp; sorely þam teche Queder þaire kyng was become? at þar care kyndils. Þan sayd Syraphis him selfe he sayd þam þir wordis: “Anec, ?our athill kyng is out of his awyn land, For Artaxenses a?e is all hi? ane foundid, Þe proude kyng of Persee þat passes vs a-gaynes. Full wele he wist, or he went quat suld worþe efter, And all þe fourme of þe fare þat fall ?ow be-houys. For all þe erth of Egipt fra end v?-to othire Bees conquirid &amp; ouercomyn clene alto-gedre. Þe puple out of Perse is purvaid all samen; Þe kyng is comand full kene with his kene ostis, Þat sall oure renkis all rayme &amp; oure rewme bathe, And we be all at þare will þus is wirdis schapen. Sen it is sett to be soo &amp; slipe it ne may, Ne schewid to be na noþire scha? ne we to schount nouthire, Bot gefe þaim vp þe girdill vs gaynes no?t ellis. Bot seses, seris, of ?our syte &amp; soru?es na mare; For certay?,” quod Syraphis “my-selfe I it knawe, ?our king sall in a noþire kithe kast out his elde, And come a-gay? eft ?onge man ?it to his rewme. Þa? sall þat victoure ?ow venge o? ?our vile fais, And þe province of Persee purely distruye, And gett agay? his avy? gronde at he forgais nowe, And ane of þe oddist Emperours of þe werde worthe.” When he þis talis had tald þen tuke þai be-lyfe, And efter Anec on-ane ane ymage gert make; Þe buke sais, of blake stane all þe bode ouyre, With corone &amp; with conyschantis as it a kynge were. Quen it was perfite &amp; pi?t a place þai it wayted, And stallid him in a stoute stede &amp; sti?thed him faire. Lordis lift him o? loft &amp; lawe to him bowid, In reuerence of þe riche kyng at had þer rewme gydid. Quen he was semely vp set with septour in hand, Þen ledis at ware lettird o? lawe at his feet All þe sawis of þaire Syre as Siraphis tald, Þare ga? þai graithly þa? graue in golden lettirs, All þe wordis at he þaim werpid of þaire ware kynge. Þare þai wrate þam I-wis as þe buke tellis, Supposand þaim in sum tyme for sothe to be knawen, And men to make of þa? mynd euer-mare efter. Be þat þaire enmes þar erde was entird with-in, Þe powere oute of Persee with many proude ostes; Bot of þar batails to brefe it botis me na ferrire. For all þai conquirid clene þis cithe at þaire will, And Anec is all his ane ferre of his awy? landis, With-in þe merris of Messedoy? þar na ma? him knewe. Bot will ?e herken hende now sall ?e here How he kide him in þe courete &amp; quayntid him with ladis. Secundus passus Alexandri. Syre, it be-tid o? a tyme þe text me recordis, Þat þe mode kynge of Messedone with mekill nounbre, Þat was sire Phili? þe fers farne out of toune, For to fe?t with his fais out of fere landis. Quen he was boune oute of bur?e &amp; his bake turned, As tite as Anec him amed out of his awyn kythe, He paste vp to þe Palais &amp; preualy entirs, Þat he mi?t lend þare on loft &amp; luke on þe qwene. Sone as him selfe was in þe sale &amp; sa?e hire with e?e, He beheld Olympadas þat honourable lady; Hire bewte bitis in his brest &amp; his bodi thrillis, And drifes thur?e his depe hert as he ware dartwondid. Þe lede lawid in hire lofe as leme dose of gledis, Put vp his hand to his hare &amp; heldid it bot littill. “Haile, modi qwene of Messidoyne” he maister-like said; Þare deyned him na daynte ‘madame’ hire to call, Be-cause he knew him a kyng he carpid o? þis wyse. For if he come as A clerke with a croune schauyn, And di?t as a Doctour in drabland wedis, ?it all þe erth of Egipt had he bene aire ouire. Þan answars hi? þe qwene with full myld speche, “Haile, maister,” quod þat myld &amp; made him to sytt On a sege hire be-syde of silkyn clathis, And þar hire spakid with his speche &amp; spird of hi? wordis.

Quen he had gedird his grese &amp; grune þaim esundire, For Iapis of his gemetry þe ious out he wrengis, Erne till exor?ise &amp; ethis euer elike, Þat it suld worthe as he wald &amp; o? na way faile.

Þis grete god full of grace sall glide to þi chambre, In a dredfull deuys a dragons fourme, And þan þe figour of a freke he sall take eftire, And preualy in þat part a-pere ?owe be-forne.” Þan answars him þe swete quene &amp; sone him it grantis, “Sire, chese þe a chambre quare þe chefe þinkis, Nowþire myne awen ne na nothire god lat þe no?t spare, Or any place at ?ow plece my palas with-in. For may þou hald me þis hest as þou here tellis, And profe þus in my presens as a propire sothe, Þen sall I cherische þe with chere as þou my child were, Loute þe louely &amp; loue all my lyfe days.” “Graunt mercy,” quod þe grete clerke to þe gude lady, Thankis hire full thraly &amp; þen forth wendis To loke &amp; layte him a loge quare he lenge my?te, And buske him a bedsted quare him best likid. Qwen it was metyn to þe merke þat men ware to ryst, And folke was on þaire firste slepe &amp; it was furth euyns, Þan Anec o? ane his artis he fandis, And changid by enchantmentis his chere all to-gedire. Þer worthid he by his wiche-craft in-to a wild drago?, And to the ladi lere he lendid in haste, Fli?and in his fethire-hames &amp; ferly fast sletis, And in a braide, or he blan he þe bed entris. Quen he was laide be-lyfe his liknes he changis, Worthis agay? to a wee fra a worme turnys. Þen kisses he kenely þe quene &amp; clappis in armes, Langis sare to þe layke &amp; on-loft worthis. Quen he had wro?t all his will hire wame þen he touches, And with a renyst reryd þis reson he said, “Þis concepcion with kyngis sal be callid here-efter A verra victor a-vansid with all þe vayne werde.” Þus be-gylid he this gude wyfe &amp; makis hire to wene It ware na gett of na gome bot of god ane. Qwen þe day-raw rase he rysis be-lyfe, Lendis a-lande fra þe loft &amp; left hire with child. Sone as hire bele gun bolne all hire blee changis, So was scho ferd &amp; a-fri?t a ferly ware ellis. To be bonden with barne mekill bale to hire ne?ehis, For it &amp; Philip hire fere o-ferrom was sybb.

Þis ilk Phili? þe fyrs þat in þe fi?t lenges, Þe same ny?t in his slepe he sa?e, as him tho?t, Amon his awen god in armes with his qwene, And make with hire market as [he] a man were. And quen he wro?t had his will þen witrely him metis, Þat he bowes to hire belechiste &amp; bigly it sewys, And sethen asselis it him selfe semely &amp; faire With a rede golde rynge on þis aray grayuyn; A lyons heuyd was on-loft louely coruy?; Þe bounde of a bri?t son &amp; a brande kene. And þen he went furth his way sayd, “woman, þou hauys Þi full defendoure o? fold now frely consa[u]yd.” Als radly as þe riche kyng rase o? þe morne, Ri?t in þe dawyng of day a diuinour he callis, And as him dremyd ilke a dele þat doctour he tellis, And fraynes him fast on þis fare how it be-fall suld. “Phyli?,” quod þe phylysofyre “þi fere is with childe, And with no gett of na gome bot of god selfe. And, gudman, [on] þe gold rynge þe thre grauen thyngis, Þai ere þus mekill to mene as me my mynd tellis.

Now of þis bytand brand berne, will ?e here; And all is bot þis hathill ma? as I are sayd, Þat sall sa fele men afray with faucho? in hande, And out of nounbre to neuyn of nacions wyn?.” Þan foundis Philip to þe fy?t &amp; þe fild entres, And sone in delingis of dyntis a drago? aperis, Þat stre?t be-for him in þe stoure strikis doune his faas, And all his enmys in þat erd he endid in a stounde. When Phyly? with his faire folke had þe fild wo?, Þa? metis he him to Messadone þar metis him þe qwene, Kyssis comly hire king &amp; of his come ioys, And how he fore scho him fraynes ferly ?erne. “Wele, graunt mercy,” quod þe kyng “my god, I him loue; Bot how þat ?e ga sa grete gud dame?” he sayd. Þou has ragid,” quod þe renge “with vnryd gestis; Now hafe I, lede, all to lange lengid fra hame.” Þus to bre hire o bourde he breuys þire wordis; “To quam has þou þe tane till tell m[e] þe sothe? Outhire mete has mendid þe full mekill as may I no?t trowe, Or ane has stollen in my stede sen I was stad þare.” Þus bayst he þe bri?t qwene þat all hire ble changid, To skyre skarlet hewe skyftis hire face, Hire chere at was chalke-quyte as any chaffe worthis; So was scho schamed of þe schont þat hire þe schalk made. “Nay, quod þe comly kyng “cache vp þine hert, Þofe þou haue forfet, na force so has fele othire. Þou has giltid, bot no?t gretly it greuys me þe les; For god has geten þe þis gett a-gaynes þi will; All þat was done þe bedene was me be dreme schewyd, I sa?e it surely as my-selfe slepe in my tentis, And oure god all-to-gedire is ground of þe cause; Of me worthis þe þe wite ne of na wee ellis.” Þen tyd it anes o? a tym a lytill terme efter, Þis dere kyng o? a day o? his dese syttis, Had parreld him a proude feste of princes &amp; dukis, With maisterlingis of Messadone &amp; many oþire noble[s]. Þus as he sat in his sete softly by his qwene, In schene schemerand schroude all of schire stanes, He kest vp his contenance &amp; kny?tly he lokes, And gladis gudly his gestis as his degre wald. Þa?

He was sa hatter &amp; sa hoge quen he þe hall entird, Lete sa lathely a late &amp; sa loude cried, Þat all þe fest was a-ferd &amp; oþire folke bathe. To þe chefe chaiare of þe qwene he chese him be-lyue, And laide as hendly as a hunde his hede in hire arme, Seþin kyssis he hire clene mouthe enclynes hire lawe, And braydis furth with a bry? bere out at þe brade ?atis. Þen sayd Phili? to his fere &amp; all his fre gestis, “?one selfe drago? forsothe I sa?e with myne e?e?; Quen I was stad in þe stoure he strenthid all myne oste, And þar þe floure in þe filde I fangid þur?e him selfe.” Anoþire ferly þar fell within fewe days, Þe king was sett in his sale with septer in hand; Þen come þar-in a litill brid in-to his arme flo?e, And þar hurkils &amp; hydis as scho were hand-tame; Fast scho flekirs about his fete &amp; fle?tirs aboute, And þar it nestild in a noke as it a nest were, Qwill scho had layd in his la?e a litill tyne egg, And þan scho fangis hire fli?t &amp; flo?e away swyth. Þis egg, or þe kyng wyst to þe erth fallis, Brak, &amp; so it wele burde &amp; brast all e-soundir; Þan wendis þar-out a litill worm &amp; wald it eft enter, And or scho hit in hire hede a hard deth suffirs. Þa? was ser Phili? of þat fare ferly mekill sturbid, Callis to him a kid clerke declaris to him þis wonder, Beso?t him quat it sygnified to tell him þe treuthe. “Þat graunt I gudly,” quod þe gome &amp; þus-gate he spekis: “Sire, þere sall borne be a barne of þi blithe lady, Þat dri?tyn efter þi day has destaned to regne, Þe quilke sall walke all þe werd &amp; wy? it him selfe, And hent sall a full hetire deth or he may hame couer.” Þus he vndid him ilka dele &amp; him þe dome reched, Said it was sett to be so he sa?e by his artis. And if ?ow likis of þis lare to lesten any forthire, Sone sall I tell ?ow a text how it be-tid efter. Tercius passus Alexandri. Now it te?t þe tyme at trauald þat qwene, Quen scho suld bryng furth hire birth to þe werd. Scho bidis many hard brayde baret enduris, What of wandreth &amp; wa as wemen dose all.

Bot now is meruaill to me of þis wondire, Quen þis man fra his modire wambe on þe mold fell; For all þe erd euyn ouer sa egirly schakis, Þat teldis, templis, &amp; touris tomble on hepis. Þe li?t lemand late laschis fra þe heuy?, Thonere thrastis ware thra thristid þe welkyn, Cloudis clenely to-clefe clatird vn-faire, All blakenid a-boute &amp; boris þe so?.

Bot of þe lyfe þat he li?t off he like was to nane, Nouþer of fetour ne of face to fadire ne to modyre; Þe fax on his faire hede was ferly to schawe, Large lyons lockis þat lange ere &amp; scharpe; With grete glesenand e?en grymly he lokis, Þat ware as blyckenand bri?t as blesand sternes, ?it ware þai sett vn-same? of serelypy hewys; Þe tane to brene at a blisch as blak as a cole, As any ?are ?eten gold ?alow was þe tothire. And he wald-e?ed was as þe writt schewys, ?it it tellis me þis tale þe tethe in his hede Was as bitand breme as any bare tuskis.

Þan was he lede furthe be-lyfe to lere at þe scole, As sone as to þat sapient him-self was of elde, On-ane vn-to Arystotill þat was his awen maister, And one of þe coronest clerkis þat euer knew letter. Þan was he bro?t to a benke a boke in his hand, And faste by his enfourme was fettild his place; For it come no?t a kyng so? ?e knaw wele to sytt Doune in margo? &amp; molle emange othire schrewis. Sone wex he witter &amp; wyse &amp; wonder wele leres, Sped him in a schort space to spell &amp; to rede, And seþen to gramere he gase as þe gyse wald, And þat has he all hale in a hand-quyle. In foure or in fyfe ?ere he ferre was in lare Þan othire at had bene þare seuynte wynter; Þat he suld passe him in þat plite vnpussible semed, Bot at god will at gaa furth qua may agayn stande?

Þat lare was him lefe to &amp; lerid in a qwile Was þar na lede to hi? like with-in a fewe ?eris. So cheualus a chifta? he cheuys in a stonde, Þat in anters of armes all men he passes. Quen Phili? see him sa fers in his first elde, His hert &amp; his hardynes hi?ely he lofed, Comendid mekill his kny?t-hede &amp; him callid o? a day Be-twene þam selfe o? a tyme &amp; talkis þire wordis: “Alexander,” quod þe kyng “I augirly prayse Þi wirschip, þi worthines þi wit &amp; þi strenth.

Quod Alexander to þis athill as he his arte fandis, “Quat is þe planet or þe poynt ?e purpose to seme? Quat sterne is it at ?e stody o? quare stekis it in heuyn? May ?e o?t me in any maner to þat sterne schewe?” “Þat can I wele,” quod þe clerke “ellis couthe I littill; No?t bot sewe me, so? quen þe so? is to reste, Quen it [is] dreuyn to þe derke &amp; þe day fynyst, And þou sall sothely se þe same with þine e?en.” “Is o?t þi werid to þe wissid?” quod þe wee þan; “For þat I couet to ken if þou me kythe wald.” “Sire, sothely of myne awe? so? slayne mo?

Þa? airis ser Alexander eftire his fadire, Þat euer he kyndild of his kynde kend he bot litill. Þus led he furthe his leue child late o? ane eue?, Sylis softely him selfe þe cite with-oute?, Bo?es him vp to a brenke as þe buke tellis, To þe hi?t of þe depe dike &amp; to þe heuyn waytis. “Alexander, athil so?” quod Anec his syre, “Loo! ?onder behald ouer þi hede &amp; se my hatter werdis; Þe euyll sterne of Ercules how egirly it soro?es, And how þe mode Marcure makis sa mekill ioy; Loo! ?onder þe gentill Iubiter how Iolyle he schynes, Þe domes of my destany drawis to me swythe. Þik &amp; þrathly am I thret &amp; thole mo? I sone Þe sla?ter of myne awen so? as me was sett euer.” Vnethis werped he þat worde þe writt me recordis, Þat ne Alexander as sone was at him be-hind, And o? þe bake with slike a bire he bare with his handis, Þat doune he drafe to þe depest of þe dike botho?, Sayd, “lo! vnhappeiste vndire heuyn þat þus o? hand takis As be þe welken to wete quat suld come efter! Þou has feyned þe for wyse &amp; fals all-to-gedire, Wele semys slike a sacchell to sye?e þus of lyfe!” Þan Anec, as him a?t wele augirly granys, Dryues vp a dede voyce &amp; dymly he spekis, “Wele was þis cas to me knawen &amp; kyd many wynter, Þat I suld dee slike a dethe be dome of my werdis. Sayd I þe no?t so my selfe here be-fore, I suld be slay? of my son as now sothe worthis?” Asterisks have been used to indicate additional lines interpolated from the Dublin manuscript. “What, and am I,” quod alexander “ane of þi childer?” “?ha, so?! als glad I my god I gat þe my selue?.” Fro he had hym þis worde sayd he wakens no more, Bot gaue a gremly grane &amp; þe gast ?heldez. That oþer wy for hys werkez wepys eueryllyke, So hard &amp; so hertly þat ne? hys hert brestes. Þus plenys þis prouud knyght þe pyte of hys fader, Cares hym downe into þe cafe þar as þe cors ligges, Belife lyftes he on-lofte euen on hys shulders, And beres hym forth vppon hys bake at þe brade ?ates. Sone sayd þe whene, when sho hym see with syland teres; “What haue ?e done, my dere son??” &amp; drowpys dou? in swone. “Dame, now is þar none other to do bot deme it þi selue?, For as þi foly was before so foloweth aftir.” Than makes þis ma? &amp; hys moder menskfully &amp; faire Titely hys enterment as þai þat tyme vsed. Þus shamesly of hys awne childe hym chevyd such end. And her fynes a fytt &amp; fayr when vs likez. Quartus passus. The same &amp; þe selue tyme as says me þe text, Fro þe cuntre of capadose come a kyd prince To kyng philip? þe fers &amp; hym a fole bryngez; A grett horse &amp; a hoge a hegh &amp; a wilde, A store &amp; a styf stede stalwortly bondy?; His choll chaltird &amp; chauelez in chynez of yre?; In rapes fast for ryfyng of bernes; For other mete þan manysflesche mouthed he neuer. Busifolen to þis blonk was breued þe name. He hed so ferdfull a face as ony fyre lokez; Bere als a boles heued a bryn on hys shulderr, And toton owt of hys to? als tyndis of hornes. The fayrnes of þis ilke fole when phili? avysed, Þan says he to hys seruand to see to þis capyll, And stighillys hym in so? stede a stable by hym one, With lang lates of yre? þat he might lig in. And all at wer dampned to þe deth &amp; demyd at þe lawe, Þai sall be bro?t fra þe bare þis blonk into stable, To wery at hys awne wille &amp; weyle of þe fattest. ?it phili? of hys faire goddes hym fanges such a sware, Yff ony berne wer so bald baro? or other, Or wy þat myght þis wilde best worth for to ryde, Was dewly aftir hys day destinate to regne. When alexander was of elde awght ?eres &amp; foure, Þan was he worthy &amp; wight &amp; wisely hed leryd At arestotell all ouer þe artez all seue?, And castor, ane oþer clerke þar at wer hys kyd maisteres. So carez he in þe castell-?arde &amp; commes on a day By a wyndow als þis wild horse [was] warloked in bandez; Lokes in at a lat sagh ly hym byforne So mony menbres of men wer mervayle to tell. Þar liggez lymmes of laddes leggez &amp; harmes, Tharmes thrist owt of thees banes &amp; shuldres. Som hanchyd of þe heued som þe handez ety?, So? þar riggez owt rytte &amp; som þar ribbez rent. Of þis wonder he hed &amp; so he wele burd. And hardly hys awne hand in at a hole puttes, He layd owt a lang neke &amp; hys hand likkys; Faire faldes hys fete / &amp; falles hym to þe erth, Hendly haldes vp hys heued byheld in hys face, On Alexander ay-whare euer elike wates. Þen wist þe wy wele enogh hys wyll all-to-geder; Brades vppe þe brade ?ate &amp; þe barre entres, On þe rige with hys right hande hym rodely strakez, And he full frely &amp; faire hym faunys &amp; loutez. Was neuer barslett in band more buxum to hys lord. Þen was þis blonke to þis ber? for all his breme teches. Þus lowtes þis lede on low &amp; lowsys hys chynez, Blyssis blythly hym abouute &amp; a bridyll fyndez; Grathez on þis gay gere &amp; þen a gilt sadyll; Ledes hym forth of þat loge &amp; þen of-lofte lepys. Than strenys he hys streropes &amp; stre?t vp sittes; Lad hym by þe lora? &amp; hym þe lede wissez. And he als rekyndly ran rolland hym vnder, As he þe sadyll hed sewyd seuenten wynter. Sone as phili? þe ferse hym on þis fole metes, “So?,” he sayd, “now er þe sawes into þi seluen fyneshit, Right as my graceux gode hase galet me before. For þou must rewle all my real? qwen I am raght hyne.” Quod alexander als beliue “my awne athell fader, I beseke þe my soueren þat þou my sete dresse In a chosyn chariott as a chefe maister, With folawand me a fair flete of fele men of armes.” “Þat graunt I gladly,” quod þe gome with a gode wille, “Frist of my faire foles fang þe a hundreth; And syne sexty thowsand, my so? þou þi seluen wale Of shillynges &amp; of shire gold to shote in þi Cofyre; Syne of my chefe chiftanes chese þe þe best, Þe most proved of my princez in poyntez of were; Wyes ne no wale wede want shall þe noþer, And held on with a hale here þar hersound þou worth.” Thys barne hym buskes as he bede &amp; bade he no langre, Bot grathes hym to þe gate with a gy? noble. Forth with eufestyus he ferd a freke þat he loued, Þat was a fyne Philo[so]f[e]r a frend of hys awne. ?itte takez he hym with-owte þe tow? twelf tried childer, Þat he hed Cosyn hym for chefe hys chevalry to lede; And fair enformed þam of fight &amp; fetez of armez For ?apest in hys awne yoke ?arly to drawe; Fers felons with hym fangez &amp; florens enowe, Full preciouse apparement hys person to cleth, Comand kenely hys knyghtez to kepe to hys blonkez, Þat no vnchaunce þaim achefe þat in þe chare ?odez. He prekys forth on hys play bot with a preuay men?e, Chaterand with hys chiftanes in hys child gere. To poliponenses hase he passed a prouince vnk[n]awy?, And so was strykyn or he styntyd in-to þe strange real?. The kyng of þatt cuntree þat þe kyth weldyd, Which was callyd nicholas &amp; hym naytly metes, Had rasyd vp a rode hoste &amp; heldyd hym ayaynez With bald baratours on bent hym batell to ?elde. He flonge ow[t] on a fers fole far from hys hoste, Ayres to sir alexander &amp; angrely franes: “What is þi name, notesma? neuen me þe sothe; And whyne ert þou &amp; who &amp; what makys þou here?” Þe knyght, as he wele couth hym curtasly answers: “Sir, kyng phili? þe ferse my fader was And all þe marche of massydo? he manours clene; And I hys heyre alexander als elders me calle?.” Þat oþer renishit r[e]nke hym rightes in þe sadyll, Stranes owt hys sterops &amp; sternly lokez; With a sembland as a hye sir settes owt þe brest, Sayd: “who am I þat am here as þou supposez?” “Sir, þou art a kyng of þis kyth I ken wele my-selue?, Bott neuer þe latter in þis lede if þou be lord here, hate?, Þof I þis wirschi? þe wayfe as wald þine astate, Lat þou þi hert neuer þe hi?ere hale in-to pride. For it was wont,” quod þe wee “as wyse men tellis, Full hi?e þingis ouer-heldis to held oþer-quile. Slike as ere now bro?t a-bofe nowe þe bothum askis, And slike at left ere on lawe ere lift to þe sternes.” “Sa ma aydeus,” quod þat oþire man “þou tellis me treuthe, So? þis ensample of þi-selfe þou sais me, I trowe. Vn-behalde þe wele o? ilk halfe &amp; haue a gud e?e, Les on þine ane here-efterward þine ossyngis li?t.” Þan Alexander all in ire angrile spekis: “Hy þe hethen-ward, þou hathill &amp; houe þou na langire. For na-þing as a-nente me þou has no?t to mell, Ne with þi domes me to dele dole vndire sonne.” Now is ser Nicollas anoyed &amp; nettild with ire, As wrath as [a] waspe &amp; wode of his mynde, Reviles he þis oþire renke with vnrid speche: “Behald,” quod he hedirward “&amp; herken how I say; Now be þe hert &amp; þe hele of my hathill fadire, And be þe god,” quod þe gome “þat gafe me þe saule, A[ls] sprent [of] my spittyng a specke o? þi chere, Þou sall be di?t to þe deth &amp; drepid of my handis.” Quen he had spokin so, for spyte he spittis in his face, Dispises him despetously dispersons him foule. “Hent þe þare,” quod þe hatill “as þe to haue semes, Cure, for þi kene car?e chache nowe a schame!” Þan went him furthe Alexander &amp; his ande takis, Lete a-swage or he sware þe swelme of his angirs, Be-se?is him how he say wold or he his sa?e ?eld, And turnes him þen to þe tulke &amp; talkis þire wordis: “For þou has no?tid me now Nicollas,” he sayd, I swere þe, be my syre saule &amp; by his selfe pite, And be þe worthe wombe of my wale modre Þat I was geten in of gode &amp; graithely consayued, Þou seis me, lede, or o?t lange in þi lande armed, And oþire recouyre me þi rewme or reche v? þe girdill.” Þan set þai þam slike a day to semble &amp; to fi?t, And þar-to tuke vp þaire trouthis &amp; twyned esondre. Þe? ?ode him furthe þi[s] ?ong ma? ?apeli &amp; swythe In-to þe marche of Messedone &amp; manly a-semblis Of saudiours &amp; sekir men a soume out of nounbre, Þat was þe baldest &amp; þe best breueyd in armes. He parrails him a proude ost of princes &amp; oþire, Farkis to ser Philip &amp; fangis his leue, And þa? Bocifilas his blonke he bremely ascendis, And bounes o? with his bataill out at þe brade ?atis. Þe same day at was sett þe sembling of bathe, Aithire with a firs flote in þe fild metis. Þe nounbre of ser Nicollas it noyes me to reken, And Alexander was ane oste of augird many. With þat þai tuke vp þaire trompes a-po? þe twa sidis, Braidis banars a-brade buskis to mete. So kinlid þe clarons þat all þe cliffe rynges, Þe holtis &amp; þe haire heere &amp; þe hillis scheuyn. Ilk a hathill to hors hi?is him be-lyue, Stridis into stele-bowe stertis apon loft, Has a helme o? his hede &amp; honge o? his swyre A schene schondirhand schild &amp; a schaft hentis. Quat of stamping of stedis &amp; stering of bernes, All dymed þe dale &amp; þe dust ryses. With slik a bront &amp; a brusche þe bataill a-sembild, As þe erth &amp; all þe el[e]mentis at anes had wrestild. Now aithire stoure o? þar stedis strikis to-gedire, Spurnes out spakly with speris in hand, Brekis in-to blasons bordren shildis, Beris in-to bri?t stele bitand lances, Sone in scheuerand schidis schaftis ere brosten, Al to-spryngis in sprotis speris of syris, Dryfuys doune duchepers &amp; doykis of þar horses, Fellis fay to þe fold many fresch kny?tis. Quat dose now þis Nichollas bot nymes him a spere, Kest him on þis ?ong kny?t to couire him a name; And Alexander with anothire airis him agayne, Girdis grymly to-gedire greuosly metis. Sa sare was þe semble þire seggis be-twene, Þat al to-wraiste þai þar wode &amp; werpis in-sondire, Al to-clatirs i?-to cauels clene to þaire handis, Þar left nouþire in þar hand þe lengthe of an elly?. Þen littid þai na langer bot laschid out swerdis, Aithire a blesynand brand brait out of schethe, Hewis o? hattirly had thurgh mailes, Many starand stanes strikis of þaire helmes. Þen Alexander in ane ire his arme vp-liftis, Swythe swyngis out his swerde &amp; his swayfe feches. Þe noll of Nicollas þe kyng he fra þe nebb partis, Þat doun he fell fra his fole &amp; fynyst for euir. Þus was him destand þat day as dri?ten had shapid, To hent him þe hi?ere hande of his athill fais. Þare slike wirschip he wa? ware wonder to tell; Had of þat hi?e kyng þe hede fra þe shuldirs. Þen was him geuyn vp þe ?erde &amp; ?olden þe rewme, And all at left was o lyfe lordis &amp; othire, Come to þat conquerour &amp; o? knese fallis, And in his mercy &amp; meth mekely þaim put. Þis renke &amp; his rounsy þai reche vp a croune, As gome at has þe garland &amp; all þe gre won?. Þus with þe floure in þe fild he fangid his enmy, And haldis o? with hale here hame to his fadire. Þa? fyndis he Philip o? his flett with a fest huge Had wed him anoþer wyfe &amp; wayfid his quene; Ane Cleopatras caled a grete kyngis do?ter, And [laft] had Olympadas &amp; openly for-sake?. “Fadire,” quod þis fell kny?t quen he þis fest entirs, “Þe palme here of my first price I pray þe resayfe, Forthe to þe weding or I winde of my wale modire, And kaire me to a-noþire kyng to couple hire to wyfe. For þe to felsen ne to folo?e fallis me na mare, Ne here to duell with þi douce deynes me na langer, Now þou mas þe slike a mangery &amp; macchis changis, And I to consaile vn-callid I ca? no?t þar-on.” With þat þar carpis to þe kyng a kny?t at þe table, Ane lesias, a lede &amp; o? loude speches: “Cleopatras a knafe child co?sayue sall &amp; bere, Þat demed is eftir þi deth duly to regne.” Þa? Alexander at þis kny?t angirs vnfaire, Wynnes hi? v? a wardrere he walt i? his handis, So hard him hittis o? þe hede his hernes out weltid, And sa he lost has þe lyfe for his leþer wordis. Þan was þe wale kyng wrath as wonder ware ellis, Braydis him vp fra þe borde &amp; a brand clekis, Airid toward Alexander &amp; ames him to strike. Bot þan him failis þe feete or he first wenys, He stakirs, he stumbils &amp; stande he ne mi?t, Bot ay fundirs &amp; fallis as he ferde ware. Þe faster forward him he faris þe faster he snapirs; Quat was þe cause of þe case þat knawis oure lorde. “Quat now,” quod athill Alexander “quat ailis þe to fall? Has þou na force in þi fete ne fele of þi-selfe? For a freke to be ferd or a-fraid outhire, And þou þe gouernere of grece þat ware grete wondire!” Þen tittis he doune in þat tene þe tablis ilkane, Out of þe hall be [þe] hare halis he þe bride, And so þe wee in his wreth wrekis his modire, And Philip falne [was] sare seke &amp; all þe fest strubled. As sone as Alexander of angire he slakis, He lendis o-loft to þe lede a litill days eftir, Cairis vp with comfurth þe kyng for to vysite, He comes to þe curten &amp; carpis þis wordis: “Philip,” quod þis ilke freke &amp; forwith hi? standis, “Þof it vn-semely me sytt þe so for to call, No?t as þi suget &amp; þi so? my sawe I þe ?eld, Bot as a felaw or a frynde fallis to a-nothire. Sire, latt þi wreth a-wai wende &amp; with þi wyfe sa?till, And þe los of Lesias litill þou charge. I did bot my deuire to drepe him, me thinke; For it awe him no?t sa openly slike ossing to make. And ser, vnworthely þou wro?t &amp; þat þou wele knawis, Quen þou was boune with a brand my bodi to schende.” Þen rewis þe riche kyng of vnride werkis, Blischis vp to þe berne &amp; braste out at grete. Þen airis him o? Alexander to his awe? modire; “Bees not a-glopened, madame ne greued at my fadire; If all ?e synned him be-syde as ?our selfe knawis, Þar-of na we may þe wite it was godis will.” With þat he fanges hire furthe to Philip hire ledis, And he comly hire kist &amp; cordis with hire faire, Anes with Olympadas &amp; þe tothire woydis, And lofes hire lely to his lyfes ende. Quintus passus Alexandri. Sone eftir in a seson as þe buke sais, Come driuand fra Darius þe deyne Empereure, Heraudis on he?e hors hendly a-rayed, To ser Philip þe fers to feche þar trouage. Litill kyngis þar come as þe clause tellis, Li?t doune at þe loge &amp; þar blonkis leues, Caires in-to þe curte to craue him þar dettis, Touchis titly þar tale &amp; tribute him askis. “?a, caires hame,” quod Alexander “a-gay? to ?our kithes, And sais ?our maister, he make na ma sandis; For sen Philip had a fresche so? þat fast now encressis, Þat bees no?t suffird, I supose nane slike him to ?eld. For sais ?our lord, þe lefe he? þat laide hir first egg, Hire bodi nowe with barante is barely consumed, And is Darius so of his dett duly depryued; And be þis titill, him tellis na tribute him fallis.” Þen merualid þa? þe messangirs mekill of his speche, His witt &amp; his wisdome wonderly praysed. Faire at ser Ph[ilip] þe fers fang þai þar leue, And syne clene of all þe curte &amp; cairis to þar landis. To þe palais of þe proude kyng to persie þai went, Dose þam in to Darius þar he o? dese syttis, And telles him how his trouage is tynt al-to-gedire, As Alexander awy? mouth had þa? all enfourmed. Þen messangirs to Messedoyne come in þe mene qwile To Ph[ilip] þe fell kyng &amp; freschly him tald, Þat all þe erthe of Ermony Erles &amp; princes, Þat suld be suget to him-selfe wald seke him with armes. And Alexander belyfe as athil ma? suld, Vndirfangid to fe?t for Ph[ilip] to wende, Gedirs him a grete ost graithes him in plates, And aires toward Ermony þat erd to distroy. Þan was a man in Messadone in þe marche duellid, A proued prince &amp; a proude Pausanna was hatte?, A big berne &amp; a bald in brenys to ryde, Þe so? of ane Cerastis as þe buke witnes. Þis freke all his franche of Ph[ilip] he haldis, And was a suget to him-selfe &amp; serues him a?t; Bot þa? he depely many day disired to haue þe quene, And lyes vmlapped with hire lufe many lange wynter. And by þat cause to þe kyng he kest slik a hate, Þat he desiris his deth &amp; di?tis [him] þare-fore. All þe folke of his affinite he freschly a-semblis, And sekis furth with a hoge some a-saile him to ?eld. Que? Ph[ilip] heris of þat fare gret ferly hi? thinke[s], Ferkis furth with a fewe folk him in þe fild metis, Seis þe multitude sa mekill of men at he bringes, Braidis o? his blonke toward þe bur?e &amp; þaim þe bak shewis. Þen schrikis schilli all þe schalkis &amp; schoutis him at anes, And Pausanna þe prince a-pon a proude stede Sprengis out with a spere &amp; spedis him eftir, And þurgh þe bac in-to þe brest him beris to þe erd; He heldes dou? in þe hey way &amp; halfe deyde liggez, All ware he wondirly wondid he wendis no?t be-lyfe. His men &amp; all þe Messadones full mavnly ware stourbed, Quat of doloure &amp; dyn quen þai him dede hopid. Pausanna þan for þe prowis slike a pride hentis, Vnethes wist he for welth wirke quat he mi?t. He prekis in-to þe palais to pull out þe quene, Wenys to wild hire at will &amp; away lede. Þan comes Alexander in þat cas þe cronaclis tellis, With a riall ost of many able princes, Airand out of Ermony &amp; had all þe erth wo?; Sees slike a rottillyng in þe rewme &amp; ridis al þe faster. Þa? past vp þe proud quene in-to preue chambre, Wayues out at wyndou &amp; waytis a-boute, Sa?e be þe sygnes &amp; be sike as with hire so? comys, And be þe alyens armes at he was all maister. With þat scho haldis out hire hede &amp; he?e to him callis, “Quare is þi werdes, my wale so? þou wa? of þi godis, Þou suld be victour &amp; venge &amp; vencust neuire? If þou haue any hert here help now þi modire.” Sone as pausanna þe prince with-in þe palais heris Þe comyng of þe kene kny?t he caires him agaynes, Presis out of þe palais with a pake armed, And metes him in þe myd-fild with a mekill nounbre. And Alexander be-lyue quen he o? him waites, He swyngis out with a swerd &amp; swappis him to dethe; And þe renkis, all the route reches vp þaire wapen Vn-to þis kid conquirour &amp; cried eftir socure. Þa? was þar ane in þe ost o? Alexander callis, Sayd, “Ph[ilip] þi fadire is in þe fild drepid.” And he halis furth on hede &amp; halfe-dede him fyndis, Brusches doune by þe berne &amp; bitterly wepis. “A! Alexander!” quod þe kyng “now am I at ane ende;” A litill liftis vp his liddis &amp; lokis in his face; “Bot ?it it gladis me,” quod þe gome “to ga þus to deth, To se my slaare in my si?t be sa sone ?olden, A! wele be þe, my wale so?” &amp; waged with his hede; “Þou has baldly o? my bane &amp; bremely me vengid.” With þat he bloþirs in þe brest &amp; þe breth stoppis, And in a spedfull space so þe sprete ?eldis. And Alexander ay o?-ane augirly he wepis, And gretis for him as greuously as he him geten hade. With barons &amp; bachelers him bro?t to þe cite, And erdis him in his awen erd as Emperoure fallis. The day efter his deth drerely him wendis Alexander his aire &amp; syttis in his trone, A clene croune o? his hede clustird with gemmes, To se how him seme wald þe sete of his fadire. He seis doune in þe sete with septer in hande, Makis a crie þat all þe curte kni?tis &amp; erles Suld put þaim in-to presens his precep to here. And all comy? at a kall &amp; o? kneis heldis; Þan blisches he to his baronage &amp; breues þir wordis: “Lo! maistirs of Messedone sa mi?ty me? &amp; noble, ?e Traces &amp; of Tessaloyne &amp; ?e þe trewe Grekis, How likis ?ow nowe ?our lege lord? lokis o? my fourme, And letis all ferdschip at flee &amp; fange vp ?our hertis, And aires for nane alyens quils Alexander lastis. For with þe graunt of my god I gesse, or I dye, Þat all the Barbare blode sall bowe to my-selfe. Þare is na regio? ne rewme ne renke vnder heuen, Ne nouthire-quare na nacio? bot it sall my name loute. For we of grece sall haue þe gree with grace ay to wild, And anely be ouer þe werd honourd &amp; praysed. And quilk of all myne athill me? þat any armes wantis, Lat pas in-to my palais &amp; plates him delyuire, And he at of his awe? has harnas him swythe, And make him boune ilka berne to bataill to ride.” Þa? answard him with [a] voice all his proud princes, And Erles in his Empire þat ware in eld strike?, Hathils of hi?e age Auncient kni?tis, Barons &amp; bachelers &amp; bryssid ware in Armes: “Sire, we hafe farne to þe fi?t &amp; bene in fild preued With ser Ph[ilip] ?our fadire mony fele wynter, And now vs failis all oure force &amp; oure flesch waykis; For be þe floure neuer sa fresche it fadis at þe last.

Þen dose him furthe þis dere kyng a litill dais eftir, Alexander with ane ost of many athill dukis, Samed a vnsene somme to saile he begynnes Ouer in-to ytaile þa yles to distruye. In-to þe coste of Calodone he comes him ouer first, And þar a cite he asailes &amp; in sege lengis. Bot wees wi?tly with-in þe wallis ascendid, Freschly fendid of &amp; fersly with-stude. “?e Calodoyns,” quod þe kyng he callis fra withoute, “Outhire macches ?ow may?ly þerto or namely dies, And fi?tis fast with ?our fais to ?e fey worthe, Or ?efes ?arely vp þe ?erde &amp; ?eld me þe cite.” So chaunses it þis chiftan or he a-cheued þine, Þat fele he brenes of þa bernes &amp; þe bur?e wynnes, And caires so out of Calodone quen he it couerid had, Ouer þe ythes in-to Italee &amp; þat Ile entirs. Þe? ware þai [redles of] rede all redd of his come, Prays him all of þe pees &amp; presandis him faire, Sexti thousand þai him send of sekire besandis, Of clere gold of þaire kist &amp; coruns a hundrethe. Þare tuke he tribute þat tyme þe titill recordis, Out euyn in-to þe occident of all at þare duellid, Of qwilke þe erde &amp; þe erthe Europe was callid, And ames þa? to Affrike &amp; all at esse leues. Þan ra?t he fra þa regions &amp; remowed his ost, Cachis in-to anoþire kythe &amp; crossis ouer þe stremes, Aires in-to Affrike with many athill prince[s], Anoþer wing of þe werd &amp; wynnes it be-lyfe, Þat syde sodanly &amp; sone þat ser he a-cheues. For þar he fande bot fewe þat felly withstude, Na ridars in þa regions ne rebell bot littill; He laches it þe li?tlyere as was þe les wonder. Þan kaires he fra þo contres &amp; kerue[s] ouer þe stremes, Furthe to Frantites he ferd slike a ferre Ile, Seches þar to a synagoge him-selfe &amp; his princes, Amon þar awen god at þai honoure my?t. And so to þe temple as he ti?t with his tid Erles, Þa? metis him myddis þe way was meruale to sene, A hert with a huge hede þe hareest o? erthe, Was to be-hald as a harow for-helid ouer þe tyndis; And þa? comande him þe kyng kenely to schote, Bot þar was na ma? so nemyll þat him hit couthe. “A! hilla, haile,” quod Alexander &amp; him a narawe hent, Dro?e, &amp; at þe first dra?te him dreped for euire. Fra þethen to þis ilk day þan is þat ilke place, Þe stede þar þis stith ma? strikis þis hert, Sagittarius forsoth me? gafe it to name, And will do for þat ilke werk ay qwen þe werd turnes. Þen aires him o? ser Alexander till Amo? temple, Offirs to his awen gode &amp; honours him faire, Geuys him garsons of gold &amp; of gud stanes, And hald hestes him to hete him hettirly besekis. Þan passes he þethen with his princes to sich a place wendis, Capho Resey we rede þe romaunce it callis; And þar-in fyndis him þe freke fyftene Burghes, And glidand to þe grete see xij gry? waters. Of ilka bild, sais þe buke barred was þe ?atis, Stoken stifly with-out with staplis &amp; cheynes. Þare lengis him lefe þe kynge &amp; logis all a neuen, And sacrifyce þar efsones to many sere godis. Þe same ni?t in his slepe Seraphis aperis, Anothire of his grete godis in a grym fourme, Cled in a comly clathe of castans hewes, And silis euy? to him-selfe &amp; said him þir wordis: “Alexander, athill kyng” &amp; asperly spekis, Toward a mi?ti montayne him myntis with his fynger, “May þou o?t, lede, þe ?onder lawe lyft o? þi schulder, And stire it oute of þe stede &amp; stable in a-nothire?” “Nay, qua mi?t þat,” quod þe ma? “for mede vndire heuen?” “Sire, as ?one ?ondire hi?e hill sall ay hald his place, So sall þi name fra now furth be mynned in mynde, And ay to þe day of dome þi dedis be remenbrid.” Þan Alexander belyue him askis a demaunde, “I be-seche þe now, Syraphas if þou me say wald Þe prophecy, or þou pas of all my play? werdis, How me is destayned to dye &amp; quen my day fallis?” “Sire, certayne,” quod Seraphis “as to my-selfe thinkis, For any hathill vnder heuen I hald for þe better, Withouten wa no?t at wete þe wathe of his ende Þe? know þe cas or it come &amp; ay in care lenge. Bot neuer-þe-les I sall þe neue? se? þou me now prays, Þou sall be drechid of a drinke a dra?te of vnsele, And all þi ?eris ere ?eten ?are &amp; þi ?outhe fenyst, Lange or þou haue mete? þe merke of þi mydill age. Bot quen ne in quat time sal qwaite þe þis aunter, Enquire me no?t þat questio? for I queth þe it neuer. For outhire out of þe orient sall openly here-efter Vndo þe dre?t of þi days &amp; þi ded tell.” Þa? waynest him þis vayne god &amp; voidis fra þe chambre. Þe modi kyng on þe morne all monand he ryses; Þe mast parti of his princes &amp; of his proud ost Hastis þa? in-to Ascoiloym &amp; þar þai him bydis. Þan callis he to hi? carpentaris &amp; comandis þaim swyþe In mynde &amp; in memory of him to make a cite, And neuens it his awe? name þat neuer syne changid, Bot Alexsander ay furth efter him-selue?. Sextus passus Alexandri. Now airis he furthe with his ost to Egist he thinkes; And clene all þe contre quen þai his come herd, As he had bene a hi?e gode þai ?ode him a-gay?, Resaued him with reuerence &amp; to þar rewme lede. Þere entirs him þat Emperoure &amp; in þat erd findis Of Anec his awen sire ane ymage of sable, A berne was of blake stane all þe body hewe? With conyschance of a kynge with coro? &amp; septere. Þan askis of þa? Alexander as he þar-o? lokis, Quat maner of ma? apo? mold it was made efter? “Sire, Anectabus” quod all with a steue?, “Þat all þe erth of Egipte enerid vmquile.” With þat þe flammand flode fell in his e?e?, “Þat Anec,” quod þis athil kyng “was myne awe? fadire.” Þa? fallis he flat o? þe fold &amp; þe fete kyssis; O? þe stane quare it stode stilly he mournes. Syne in-to Sirie with his seggis he so?t at þe gaynest, And þai as baratours bald him bigly with-standis, Set o? him sadly &amp; slo?e of his kni?tis; Bot ?et ?arely are he ?ode þai ?ald him þe regne. Þan drafe he sa to Damac with dukis &amp; princes, And sone he sesyd all þat syde &amp; Sydoyne he takis, And þen trussis him to Tyre &amp; þare his tentis settis Be-syde þe cite with a so?e &amp; in a sege lengys. Þare he lies with his ledis lang or he foundes, Before þe bur?e with his bernes &amp; mekill bale suffirs. Quat of ane, quat of oþire oft his oste pleynes, For wele wist þai þa? nane to wy? to þe cite, It was sa stiffe &amp; sa strang &amp; stalworthly wallid, And so hedously hi?e it was a huge wondire, Tildid full of turestis &amp; toures of defence, Batailid &amp; bretagid a-boute as a castell. Þe wawis of þe wild see apo? þe wallis betis, Þe pure populande hurle passis it vmby, It was enforced with sa fele fludis &amp; othire, It semed neuer sege vnder so? be saute it to wy?. Þan etils him sir Alexander &amp; belyue makis Be-side þe cite in þe See to sett vp a loge, A hi?e tilde as a toure teldid o? schippis, Þat mi?t na Naue for þat note ne?e to þe cite. Quen he þis baistell had bild v? to þe bur?e wallis, And ti?t him as tyme was þe toune to assaill, Slik mischife in þe mene quile emang his men fallis, For megire &amp; for meteles ware mervaile to here. Þar was Princes in poynt to perisch for euire, Alle in doute to be dede dukis &amp; erlis, In fere to be famyschist many fers kni?tis, For þar is na wa in þe werd to þe wode hunger. Þan pleynis him þe proud kyng þe pete of his me?, And sendis out his sandis-me? with selid lettirs, To ierusalem to Iaudis at þe iewes teches, Þat was þe bischo? in þat bur?e breuyd in þa dais; Him moneste as a maister him may?ly to send Fresch folke for þe fi?t &amp; fode for his oste, And all þe trouage þare to him tittly to wayne, Þat he to Darius of dewe was dangird to paye. And ?it comand he þis clerke þe kyng in his writtes, For any richas him redis rathere to thole Þe mayntenance of þe Messedoyns &amp; of þe meri Grekis, Þa? þaim of Persy to pay or to plese authere. Þa? takis þe bischop þe breue &amp; bu?es to a chambre, Resayued it with reuerence &amp; redis it ouire, Gase him doun be degrece a-gayne to þe sale, Swiftly to þe swiars &amp; þa? his sware ?eldis: “Sirs, airis a-gay? to Alexander &amp; all þus him tellis, Þat me was done many day depely to swere, Neuer Persy to paire to pas with myne armes In damaging of Darius durand his lyfe.” Sone as þe wale kyng wist he writhis him vnfaire, “Now be þat god,” quod þe gome “þat gatt me on erthe, I sall anes on þe iewis enioyne or I die, Sall ke? þa? quas comandment to kepe at þam fall.” ?it for na torfar him tid Tyre wald he no?t leue, Bot chese him out a chiftane &amp; charge[s] him belyue, A mody man, ser Meliager a maister of his oste, To fande him furth with a flote of fyue hundreth kni?tis; A[nd] Ioynes him to Iosaphat his iournay to take, And all þe pastours &amp; þe playnes prestly to driue, And bring in all þe bestaill baray? &amp; othire, Þat he mi?t se o? any syde þe cite of Gadirs. Þa? mouys he on, ser Meliager þis mi?tifull prince With a soume of sekir men &amp; Sampson þa? ledis, A renke at in þa regions had redy? oft sythis, And knew þe costis &amp; þe kitthis clene all-to-gedire. Þus ?ede þai furthe egirly &amp; entirs þe vaile, And slike a prai þa? apreued as pyne were to reke?, Bryngis furthe, sayd þe boke bestis out of nounbre, And trottes o? toward Tyre with taite at þaire hertis. Bot or þai mete? ware a myle þe meris with-outen, Þar metis þai? with a mekill flote þe maister of þe playnes, He þat was duke of þe droues &amp; of þe derfe hillis, Ane Theosellus, a tulke þat tened þa? vnfaire. He girdis in with a ging armed in plates, Alto-bruntes oure bernes &amp; brathly woundid, Fellis fele at a frusch fey to þe gronde, And many renke at he roue rase neuer efter. Þan was ser Meliager moued &amp; may?ly debatis, Flingis out o? a fole with a fell spere, Gers many grete syre grane &amp; girdis þur?e maillis, And many bernes at a braide in his brath endis. And Sampson o? anothire side setis out belyue, Bruschis furth o? a blonk brymly he smytis, Betis o? with a brande broken was his lance, Hewis doun of þa hirdis hurtis þa? vn-faire. Arystes, ane athill man ai elike fi?tis, Spirris out with a spere &amp; spedis his mi?tis, And noyed of þare note-men at þe nete kepid, And many bald, or he bla? bro?t out o-lyue. Caulus, anothire kni?t o? a kene stede, O? Theosellus in twa his tymbre he brekis; And þan he dryfes to þe duke as demys þe textis, And with a swyng of a swerd swappis of hes hede. When he was drepid &amp; dede at þe droues ?emyd, Þe prekars of þe pastors &amp; of þe proude landis, All þe folke of his affinite at fresch ware v?-wondid, Þat outhire fote had or fole to þe fli?t foundid. Þus Meliager with his me? þe menske has a-chevyd, For þe fairere of þar faes &amp; þe fild won?; Raschis with rethere &amp; rydis bot a quyle, Þat ne ne?is þa? a-nothire note as new as þe first. Þare was a maister of þe marches mi?tist of othire Ane Beritinus, a berne as þe buke tellis, Come girdand out of Gadirs out of þe grete cite, With þe selcuthest soume þat semblid was euire. Slik a mynd v?-to me ware meruaill to reke?, Thretti thousand in thede of thra men of armes, Slike as was buskest on blonkes in brenys &amp; platis, And othire folawand o? fote fele with-outen nounbre. Þe multitude was sa mekill as mynes vs þe writtis, Of wees &amp; of wild horsis &amp; wapened prenys, Sa stithe a steuyn in þe stoure of stedis &amp; ellis, As it was semand to si?t as all þe soyle trymblid. Þan ware þe Messedones amayd quen þa see sa many; Sire Meliager [was] in gret mynd a man out to sende To ser Alexander belyue þaire allire maister, To come &amp; help with his here or þai to hande ?ode. Þare was nane þat was glad þat message to gange, Bot ilka lathire &amp; othire to leue þaire frynde, Fest þar forward in-fere þat fewe at þai ware, To do as dri?ten wald deme &amp; dyi all to-gedire; To telle þaire torfere entyre it taryed me swythe. Bot so þe mode Meliager &amp; his men fe?tis, Þat ser Beritinus þe bald þai bretned to dethe, And Sampso? o? þis side was slay þar-agaynys. Þe? mournes all þe Messedones &amp; maynte? him ?erne, Makis þar mane for þat man &amp; many othire noble, For maistris &amp; mynistris menere &amp; grettir, Þat was in morsels magged &amp; martrid a hundreth. And þat left ware o? lyfe bot a litill me?ne, Ware als malstrid &amp; mased &amp; matid of þaire strenthes, Sa waike &amp; so wyndles &amp; wery for-fo?te?, Þat þai were will in þis werd qwat þai worthe suld. Sire Meliager &amp; othire maa mayned were sare, All be-bled &amp; to-brissid þat ne?e þar breth failes, Þai were sa feble &amp; sa faynt &amp; full of þaim-selfe, Þat all in fere was in fourme þe fild for to ?eld. Þa? aires him forth Arestes was augrily wondid, To Alexander onone þas auntirs hi? tellis, Þe morth of all þe Messedone[s] &amp; of þe many grekis, Rekens him þar resons þat reuthe was to here. With þat þe semely kyng chacches his bernes, Semblis him a huge soume &amp; fra þe sege wendis, Þe toure of Tire &amp; þe toune titly he leues, And Ioynes him to Iosaphat full ioyles he rydes. Ay he gretis as he gase for grefe of his kny?tis, Ay he pleynys as he passes þe pite of his erlis, Ay he wepis as he wendis for his wale princes, And soueraynly for Sampso? he sorowis ay elike. When he was tane fraward Tyre toward þe vaile, Þe werke at he wro?t had þat water whyt-in, Þat he had sett in þe see þe cite with-out, Þar-in he lefte had a lede þe loge for to kepe. Bot þan ser Balaan, a berne at in þe bur?e lengis, Ane of þe terands of Tyre atyres him belyue, Buskes him in breneis with big me? of armes, With traumes &amp; with tribochetis þe tild to asaile. He bekirs out at þe bild within þe bur?e-wallis, And þai without in þe werke wi?tly defendis, Schot scharply betwene schomes of dartis; Weris wondirly wele werpis out stanes. Bot Balaa[n] in þe barmeke? sa bitterly fi?tis, All to-combirs þa? clene with cast of engynes. Sone þe top of þe toure he tiltis in-to þe watir, And all þe tulkis in þe tild he termens o lyue; And þan in batis &amp; in bargis he bownes him swyth, To þe bothum of þe baistell he buskis him with-out, Bretens doun all þe bild &amp; þe bernys quellis, Drenches hire in þe hi?e see &amp; drawis hire o? hepis. Quen it was smeten in small with þe smert wa?es, Ilka gobet his gate glidis fra othire. Þus þe strenth ilk stike was in a stounde wasted, And Balaa[n] bowis in-to þe bur?e &amp; barris to þe ?atis. Be þis oure kyng with his kni?t[is] is comen in-to þe vaile, Alexander with ane ost his kni?tis to hel?, Fyndis a fewe of his folke fe?tand ?erne, And ay a segge be him-selfe sett all a hundreth. With þat Bucifalon his blonke he brased in þe side, Springis out with a spere spillis at þe gaynest, Ridis euen þur?e þe route þar rankest þai were, Be rawe of þar rabetis he ruschid to þe erthe, He strikis all fra þar stedis stre?t him be-forne. Was nane sa stiffe in þat stoure mi?t stand him agay?; Quare althire-thickest was þe thrange þur?e þaim he rynnes, And makis a wai wyde eno?e waynes to mete. He laschis out a lange swerde quen his launce failes, Threschis doun in a thrawe many threuyn dukis, Stirs him sa in a stonde &amp; his stithe erlis Þat þar was [na] berne on bent bott bretened or ?olden. Þe seggis o? his awen side þat he slay? fyndis, He mas to graue sum in grete &amp; sum in gray marble. And þa þat laft ware o-lyue he lokis þar woundis, And faire fangis his folke &amp; fra þe fild wendis. Þan bowes he to þe baistall &amp; brymly it semblis, Gedirs of ilk glode grettir &amp; smallire, And prekis furth with his pray &amp; passes fraward Gadirs, And ti?t agayne toward Tyre to termen his sege. Quen he was dreuyn ouer þe dales &amp; drewe to þe cite, With þat he blisches to þe bur?e &amp; sees his bild voidid, Als bare as a bast his baistell a-way, But outhire burde or bate bot þe brade wattir, Þan mournes all þe Messadones &amp; maynly was sturb[i]d. And Alexander also was augrely greuyd, So ware þai troubild out of tone quen þai þaire tild miste, Þat of þe taking of Tire trest þai na langire. And so him-selfe in his slepe þe same ni?t eftir, Him tho?t he had in his hand &amp; held of a vyne A growen grape of a grype a grete &amp; a rype, Þe quilke he flange o? þe flore &amp; with his fete tredis. And quen he broken had þe bery als þe berne semes, Þar folowis out of fresche wyne feetles to mete; So largely &amp; so delauyly of licoure, him thinkis, Of ane rasyn to ry? it was a ryfe wondire. Þe kyng callis him a clerke kenely o? þe morne, Als radly as he rase to reche him his sweuy?. “Sire, bees a-dred neuir a dele” þe diuinour said, “I vndire-take on my trouthe Tire is þine awe?; For þe bery at ?e brake sa is þe bur?e euen. Þai sall be sesid þe full sone &amp; to þi-selfe ?olde?, For þou sall eft all o? ernest entire o? þe wallis, And foulire vndir þi feete with-in a fewe days. Now compas kenely þis kyng &amp; castis in his mynd How he mi?t couir in any cas to come to þe cite, Deuynes depely on dais dropis many wiles, If he cuthe seke any sle?t þat him serue wald; And makis to sett in þe see ri?t in þe same place, Þar as þe bild at he bi[l]did biggid wasse first, To stable vp a grete strenthe all on store schipis, Hugir be þe halfe dele &amp; hi?ere þa? þe toþire; And þat he fiches &amp; firmes sa fast to þe wall, So nere vnethes at ane eld mi?t narowly betwene, And band hire, as þe buke sais bigly to-gedire, With þat scho flisch noþer fayle fyue score aunkirs. Quen he had ti?t vp þis tram &amp; þis tild rerid, Hit had of bradnes abofe to breue out of mesure; And to hede be a huge thing hi?ere it semed Þan was þe wallis, sais þe writt of þe wale touris. Þan Alexander all his ane an-ane he ascendis, Closid all in clere stele &amp; in clene plates, And monestis ilk modire so? maynly &amp; swyth, Þat all be bowne at a brayd þe bur?e to assaile. And all þe ost euy? ouir he openly comandis To be radly all arayd &amp; redy to fi?t; And quen þai sa?e þat him-selfe þe cite was entrid, Wan vp wi?tly on þe wallis ilk wee him eftir. Now tenelis vp taburs and all þe to?n rengis, Stery? steuyn v? strake strakid þar trumpis, Blewe bemys of bras bernes assemblis, Se?es to o? ilk syde &amp; a saute ?eldis. Þare presis to with paues peple withoute?; Archars with arows of atter envemonde Schotis vp scharply at shalkis o? þe wallis, Lasch at þa? of loft many lede flo?en, And þai ?apely a-?ayne &amp; ?ildis þam swythe, Bekire out of þe bur?e bald men many, Kenely þai kast of with kastis of stanys, Driues dartis at oure dukis dedly þam woundid. Þan passe vp oure princes prestly enarmed, In-to þe baistell a-bofe bremely ascendid, Sum with lances o?-loft &amp; with lange swerdis, With ax &amp; with alblaster &amp; alkens wape?. Alexander ai elike augrily fe?tis, Now a schaft, now a schild nowe a scheue hentis, Now a sparth, now a spere &amp; sped so his mi?tis, Þat it ware tere any tonge to of his turnes reky?. And þai with-in on þe wall worthili with-stude, Fersly defend of &amp; fellid of his kny?tis, Thristis ouir thikefald many threuyn berne[s], And doun bakward þa? bare in-to þe brad wattir. With þat oure wees without writhis þam vnfare, Went wode of þaire witt &amp; wrekis þa? swyth; For na wounde ne na wathe wand þai na langir, Bot all wirkis him þe wa &amp; wrake at he cuthe. Sum braidis to þar bowis bremely þai schut, Quethirs out quarels quikly be-twene; Strykis vp of þe stoure stanes of engynes, Þat þe bretage a-boue brast all in soundire, Girdis ouir garettis with gomes to þe erthe, Tilt torettis doun toures o? hepis, Spedely with sprygaldis spilt þaire braynes, Many mi?tfull man marris o? þe wallis. And be þe kirnells ware kast &amp; kutt doun before, Be þat þe baistell &amp; þe bur?e ware bathe elike hi?e, And all oure werke without þe wallis weterly semed, Þe sidis of þe cite to se to o fernes, Þa? Alexander belyf o? þa? all entris, Bruschis in with a brand on bernes a hundreth, Thrang thur?e a thousand þare thikest þai were, Wynnes worthly ouer þe wallis with-in to þe cite. Þe first modire so? he mett oþire ma? outhire, Was Balaan þe bald berne as þe boke tellis, And him he settis o? a saute &amp; slo?e him belyue, And werpid him out ouir þe wall in-to þe wild streme. Sone as oure athils be-hind sa?e þar he entred, His men &amp; all þe Messedones maynly ascendis, And þai of Grece gredely girdis vp eftire, Thringis vp o? a thraw thousandis many. Sum stepis vp on sties to þe stane wallis, On ilka staffe of a staire stike wald a cluster; And qua sa leddirs had nane as þe lyne tellis, Wald gett þa? hald with þar hend &amp; o?-loft clyme. Sa fre?t ware þar othire þat fe?tis withi?, For Balaan þar bald duke þat bro?t was of lyue, Þat all failis þa? þe force &amp; so ferd worthe, Þat nothire with stafe ne with stane withstand þai na langir. Sire Alexander with his athils &amp; his awe? sle?tis Þe toune of Tire þus he tuke &amp; othire twa bur?es, In þe quilke þe siriens of þis sire so many soro?es had, As wald bot tary all oure tale þaire tourment to reken. Sone as þis cite was sesid &amp; slayne vp &amp; ?olden, Þen ridis furth þe riche kyng &amp; remowed his ost, Gais him furth to Gasa a-nothire grete cite, And þat he settis on a saute &amp; sesis it be-lyue; And quen þis Gasa was geten he graythis him swyth, And Ioynes him toward Ierusalem þe iewis to distroy; And ?e þat kepis of þis car?e to knaw any ferre, Sone sall I neuen ?ow þe note þat is next eftir. Septimus passus Alexandri. Als hastily as þai herd of in þe haly cite, And bodword to þe bischop bro?t of his come, For Alexander a?e almast he euen deis, For he had nite him a nerand no?t bot o new time. And now him þinke in his þo?t him thurt no?t haue carid In all his mast mystir nad he þat man faylid, When he for socure to þe cite sent him his lettir; And he soyned him be his sorement þat sare him for-thinkis. “For me had leuer,” quod þe lede “be lethirely forswor? O? as many halidoms as opens &amp; speris, Þa? anys haue greuyd þat gome or warned him his erand! Þat euer I warned him his will wa is me þat stonde!” Þus was Iaudes of ioy &amp; iolite depryued; And all þe iewis of ierusalem he Ioyntly a-sembles. He said, “Alexander is at hand &amp; will vs all cumbre, And we ere dredles vndone bot dri?ten vs help.” Þan bedis þe bischo? all þe bur?e barnes &amp; othire, Athils of all age eldire &amp; ?ongire, Comandis to ilka creatour to crie þur?e þe stretis, To thre dais o? a thrawe be threpild to-gedire, Ilk a frek &amp; ilka fante to fast &amp; to pray, To ocupy þar oures &amp; orisons &amp; offire i? þar temple, And call vp with a clene voice to þe kyng of heuy?, To kepe þam, at þis conquiroure encumbrid þaim neuir. Now se?en þai to þar Sinagogis all þe cite ouire, Ilka bodi þar bedis þat in þe bur?e lengis, Putt þam to prayris &amp; penaunce enduris, Þe vengance of þis victoure to voide if þai mi?t. Þe ni?t eftir þe note as tellis me þe writtis, Quen all þe cite was on-slepe &amp; sacrifis endid, In ane abite of þe aire ane Aungell aperis To Iaudas of ierusalem &amp; him with ioy gretis: “I bringe þe bodword of blis ser bischo?,” he said, “With salutis of solas I am sent fra þe trone, Fra þe maister of ma? þe mi?tfull fadere, Þat bedis þe no?t be a-baist he has þi bone herd; And I amonest þe to-morne as I am enIoyned, Þat þou as radly as þou rise aray all þe cite, Þe stretis &amp; in all stedis stoutly &amp; faire, Þat it be onest all ouire &amp; ope? vp þe ?atis. Lett þa? þe pupill ilka poll apareld be clene, And al manere of men in mylk-quyte clathis. And pas, þou &amp; þi prelatis &amp; prestis of þe temple, Raueste all o? a raw as ?oure rewill askis. And quen þis conquirour comes caire him agaynes; For he mo? ride þus &amp; regne ouire all þe ronde werde Be lordschip in ilka lede in-to his laste days, And þen be di?t to þe deth of dri?tins ire.” Sone þe derke ouire-drafe &amp; þe day springis, Oure bischop bounes him of bed &amp; buskis on his wedis, And þen iogis all þe iewis &amp; generall callis, A-vaies þaim his visio? how þe voice bedis; Þan consals him þe clergy clene all-to-gedire, And all þe cite asentis sarazens &amp; oþir, To buwne furth with all þe bur?e &amp; buske þa? belyue, As him was said in his slepe þis soueray? to mete. Þan rynnes he furth in a rase &amp; arais all þe cite, Braidis ouire with bawdkyns all þe brade stretis, With tars &amp; with tafeta þar he trede sulde, For þe erth to slike ane Emperoure ware ouire feble. He plyes ouire þe pauement with pallen webis, Mas on hi?t ouire his hede for hete of þe so?e, Sylours of sendale to sele ouire þe gatis, And sammes þaim o? aithire side with silken rapis, And þen he caggis vp on cordis as curteyns it were, Euen as þe esyngis ?ede ouire be þe costes, All þe wawis with-oute in webis of ynde, Of bri?t blasand blewe browde? with sternes. Þus atired he þe toune &amp; titely þar-eftir On ilka way wid open werped he þe ?atis; And qua so lukis fra with-out &amp; with-in haldis, It semyd as þe cite to se ane of þe seuy? heuyns. Now passis furth þis prelate with prestis of þe temple, Reueschid him rially &amp; þat in riche wedis, With erst &amp; abite vndire all as I am in-fourmede, Fulle of bridis &amp; of bestis of bise &amp; of purpre; And þat was garnest full gay with golden skirtis, Store starand stanes strekilland all ouire, Saudid full of safirs &amp; oþire sere gemmes, And poudird with perry was perrour &amp; othire. And sithen he castis o? a Cape of kastand hewes, With riche rabies of gold railed bi þe hemmes, A vestoure to vise o? of violet floures, Wro?t full of wodwose &amp; oþer wild bestis; And þan him hi?tild his hede &amp; had on a Mitre, Was forgid all of fyne gold &amp; fret full of perrils, Sti?t staffull of stanes þat stra?t out bemes, As it ware shemerand shaftis of þe shire so?. Doctours &amp; diuinours &amp; othire dere maistris, Iustis of iewry &amp; iogis of þe lawe, Ware tired all in tonacles of tarray? webbis; Þai were bret-full of bees all þe body ouire, And oþer clientis &amp; clerkis as to þe kirke fallis, Ware all samen of a soyte in surples of raynes, Þat slike a si?t, I supose was neuer sene eftire, So parailed a processio? a person a-gaynes. Now bowis furth þe bischop at þe bur?e ?atis, With prestis &amp; with prelatis a pake out of nombre; And all þe cite in sorte felowis him eftir, Quirris furth all in quite of qualite as aungels; Maistirs, marchands, &amp; Maire mynistris &amp; othire, Worthi wedous &amp; wenchis &amp; wyues of þe cite; Be ilka barne in þe burgh as bla?t ere þaire wedis As any snyppand snawe þat in þe snape li?tis. Þar passis þe processio? a piple be-forne, Of childire all in chalk quyte chosen out a hundreth, With bellis &amp; with baners &amp; blasand torchis, Instrumentis &amp; ymagis with-in of þe Mynstire; Sum with sensours &amp; so[m] with silueryn cheynes, Quare-of þe reke aromatike rase to þe welken; Sum with of þe saynt-ware many sere thingis, With tablis &amp; topoures &amp; tretice of þe lawe; Sum bolstirs of burnet en-brouden with perill, Bare before þe bischop his buke on to lig; Sum candilstickis of clere gold &amp; of clene siluer, With releckis full rially þe richest on þe auutere. Þus seyis all þe semle þe cite with-oute, Vn-to a stonen stede stre?t on þe temple, Scopulus, by sum skill þe scripture it callis, And þare þe come of þe kynge þis couent abidis. Sone Alexander with ane ost of many athille dukis, Come prekand toward þe place with princes &amp; erlis, Sees slike a multitude of men in milke-quite clathis, And ilk seg in a soyte at selly him thinkis. Þan fyndis he in þis oþire flote fanons and stolis, Practisirs &amp; prematis &amp; prestis of þe lawe, Of dialiticus &amp; decre doctours of aythir, Bathe chambirlayn &amp; chaplayne in chalk-quite wedis. And as he waytis in a wra þan was he ware sone Of þe maister of þat meneyhe in-myddis þe puple, Þat was þe bald bischop a-bofe alle þ[e] iewis, Was graþid in a garment of gold &amp; of pu[r]pree. And þan he heues vp his e?e be-haldis on his myter, Be-fore he sa?e of fyne gold forgid a plate, Þar-in grauen þe grettest of all gods names, Þis title, Tetragramaton for so þe text tellis. With þat comandis þe kyng his kny?tis ouire ilkane, Bathe bero? &amp; bachelere &amp; bald men of armes, Na nere þat place to aproche a pay? of þar lyuys, Bot all to hald þa? be-hynd heraud &amp; othire. Þan airis he furth all him ane to þis athill mene?e, Bowis him doun of his blonke þe bischop be-forne, And kneland o? þe cald erth he knockis o? his brest, And reuerencez þis haly name at he seis wrete?. Þan þe iewis of ierusalem Iustis &amp; othire, Lordis &amp; ladis &amp; be þe litill childere, Enclynes þam to þe conquirour &amp; him o? kneis gretis, Kest vp a kene crie &amp; carpis þir wordis. “Ay mo?t he lefe, ay mo?t he lefe” quod ilka man twyse, “Alexander, þe athill aire vndire þe heuy?, Ay mo?t he lefe, ay mo?t he lefe þe lege Emperoure, Þe wildire of all þe werde &amp; worthist o? erthe, Ay mo?t he lef, ay mo?t he leue” quod loude all at anys, “Ouircomere clene of ilka coste &amp; ouircomyn neuir, Þe gretest &amp; þe gloriosest þat euir god formed, Erle or Emperoure &amp; any erdly prince.” Þare was comen with him kyngis as þe clause tellis, Seneiours out of Sireland was to him-selfe ?olde?, And þai meruailed þam mekill as þe buke tellis, When þai it herd so be-heryd &amp; held it in wondire. Þan Permeo?, a proude kni?t a prince of his oste, Aires to sir Alexander &amp; askis at him swythe, Syn him adoured all men eldire &amp; ?ongir, Qui he obeschid so lawe &amp; bende þe bischo? of iewis? “Nay,” quod þe comly kynge &amp; þe kny?t swaris, “Nouthire haylsid I him ne hildid him nouthire, Bot it was gode at I grete þe gouernoure of all, Of quam in þe abite &amp; þe armes he was all clethid. For in þe marche of Messedone me mynes on a tyme, Þat slike a segg in my slepe me sodanly aperid, Euyn in slike a similitude &amp; þis same wedis, For all þe werd as þis wee wendis now atired. And þen I mused in my mynde how at I my?t wy? Anothire anell of þe erth þat Aysy we call it, And me thret to be thra &amp; for na þing turne, Bot tire me titely þarto &amp; tristly to wende. And syne sa?e I na segg þat sa was arayd; And sekirly yone semys þe same to se to withi?, Þe same gode at I in my slepe sa?e in my days; And now I hope me, þur?e þe helpe of þe haly fadire, Of quam þe hered haly name is ?ondire o? hi?e wreten, To do with Darius or I dyi how so me dere thinke, And þe pride of all þe Persens purely distroy. And ?it I sothely supose quat so my sale hopis, Þat sall fall apon fold slik fyaunce I haue In þe grace of grete god at gyes all þe sternes, Þat it sall be in my will &amp; o? na way faile.” Now tas þe bischo? þe berne &amp; to þe bur?e wendis, With sange &amp; solempnite him to þe cite ledis, He was resayued, as I rede with reuerence &amp; Ioye, As he ware duke of ilk douth &amp; dreuyn doun fra heuen. Þan gas he furth with his gingis to godis awen temple, Þat of sir Salamon þe sage sett was &amp; foundid, And þare he lythis of þare lare as þe law wald; He offird in þat oratori &amp; honourd oure lorde. And Iaudas of ierusalem &amp; all þe iewis eftir Bringis out a brade buke &amp; to þe berne reches, Was plant full of prophasys playnely all ouire, Of þe doctrine of Daniell &amp; of his dere sawis. Þe lord lokis on þe lyne &amp; o? a lefe fyndis How þe gomes out of grece suld with þaire grete mi?tis Þe pupill out of Persye purely distroy; And þat he hopis sall be he &amp; hertly he ioyes. Þan partis he to þa prelatis many proude giftis, Was nane sa pore in þat place bot he his purse fillis, Geues þa? garsons of gold &amp; of gud stanes, Rife riches eno?e robies &amp; perles, Besands to þe bischo? he bed out of nounbre, Reches him of rede gold ransons many, Tas him to his tresory talent him to shewe, Bad him wale quat he wald &amp; wild him þe toþir. ?it bedis he him, þe bald kyng as þe buke tellis: “Sire, quat þou will in þis werd to wild &amp; to haue, No?t bot aske it at Alexander quat þou will apon reso?, And I sall grant, or I ga with a gud will.” Þan bowis doun þe bischop &amp; him a bone askis, “Sire, þis I depely disire durst I it neuy?, Þat it be leuefull vs oure lare &amp; oure law vse, As oure fadirs has folowid forwith þis tyme; As of ?oure grete gudnes at ?e grant wald To lat vs sitt be safe bot for þis seuyn wyntir, But tribute or trouag quils þe terme lastis, Þan were we halden all þe hepe to hi?e þe for euir. And ?it I will, be ?oure leue a worde &amp; na mare, Þat þe men of Medi man, be ?oure leue, Lang all in oure lawe lely to-gedire, And þai of Babilo? bathe &amp; bede I na nothire.” Quod Alexander belyue “all þis I graunt, And els any othire thing aske &amp; be serued.” “Nay, now na mare,” quod þe man &amp; mekly him thankid, “Bot ay þi lordschi? &amp; þi loue quils my lyfe dures.” Now kastis þis conquirour to caire fra þe cite, And mas to bide in þe bur?e a berne of his awyn, A messagere to myn on quat me? of him said, Ane Ardromacius, a gome as þe buke tellis. Þan bowis to þe bischo? his benyson to fang, Takis lufly his leue &amp; lendis o? forthere. To Sere cites þar be-syde he so?t with his hostis, And þai frendly &amp; faire frely resayued him. Þan of þe Siriens summe in þe same tyme Folow fra þe fell kyng as fals men suld, Did þam to sir Darius &amp; depely þam playnt, Quat erroure of þis Emperoure &amp; euill þai suffird. And he þam faire vndir-fong &amp; fraynes þam ?erne, Askis þa? of sir Alexander all at he cuthe, Bathe of his statoure &amp; his strenth if he ware store ben, His qualite, his quantite he quirys all-to-gedire; And þai in parchement him payntid his person him shewid, Ane amla?e, ane asaleny ane ape of all othire, A wirling, a wayryngle a wawil-e?id shrewe, Þe cait[if]este creatour þat cried was euire. And þan, as he lenes &amp; lokis on his fourme, His litillaike &amp; his licknes he laythly dispiced, And thre thingis of his thede he þo?t him sa feble, He dressis to him in dedeyne &amp; in dispite sendis: First a ball, says þe buke þe barne with to play, A herne-pa? es of a berne of brend gold yeuen, For hottre &amp; for hething a Hatt made of twyggis; Sayd þat was benere him to bere þan a bri?t helme. Slike presandis out of Persy he to þe prince sendis, His brefe with a brade sele &amp; biddis hum ga swythe. And qua sa will has to wete howe it worthis eftir, Now sall I neuen vs here next þe note of his lettir. Octauus passus Alexandri. “Sire dere Darius on dese þe digne Emperoure, Þe kyng without comparrison of kyngis all othire, Of all lordis þe lord þat leues in erthe, Predicessour of princes &amp; peree to þe son?, Þe souerayne sire of my soyle þat sittis in my trone, In fang with my faire godis þat I affie maste, To Alexander, þat of all so augrily him letes, Oure subiet &amp; oure seruand þus we oure-selfe write. For it is wayued vs to wete þat wickidly þou haues, Þur?e enmyte &amp; enuy elacion of pride, Be vanyte &amp; vayne glori þat in þi wayns kindlis, Puruayd þe pletours oure partis to ride. For þou has samed, as men he sais a selly nounbre Of wrichis &amp; wirlingis out of þe west endis, Of laddis &amp; of losengers &amp; of litill theuys, Slike sary soro?is as þi-selfe to seke vs agaynes, And wenes to wild all þi will &amp; þat worthis ful late, Þe prouynce &amp; principalte of Persye la graunt. For þou ert fere al to faynt oure force to ministere; Þof þou had gedird all þe gomes þat euire god fourmed, So, man, riued is oure rewme þat þou may re?t lycken Þe store strenthe of oure stoure to sternes of þe heuen. And slike a nekard as þi-selfe a no?t of all othire, Is bot a madding to mell with mare þan him-seluen. Forthi is bettir vnbynd &amp; of þe brathe leue, And feyne all with fairnes &amp; fayne at þou may. For mare menseke is a man to meke him be tyme, Þan eftir made to be meke malegreue his chekis. For all þe gracious godis &amp; gudnes o? erthe, Þat sanys sete &amp; soile &amp; sustaynes þe erth, Prayses ay þe Persyns passing all othire, And for þe oddiste of ilka ost honoures oure name. And slike a dwinyng, a dwa?e &amp; a dwer?e as þi-selfe, A grub, a grege out of grace ane erd-growy? sorowe, Will couet ?it as a king with caytefes to lyte, To couir at combrid all þe kyngis vndire þe cape of heuen! Ri?t as a flaw of fell snawe ware fally? of a ryft, Of a wysti won? waghe with þe wynd blawen, So with a flote of Fresons folowand þi helis, Þou sekis fraward Sichim þi-selfe wrothir-haile, And leuys as a lorell þus oure lande to entire, And maa þi lepis &amp; þi laikis &amp; quat þe liste ellis, As ratons or ru?e myse in a rowme chambre, Aboute in beddis or in bernys þare baddis ere nane. Bot I haue wilily waited þi wiles &amp; þi castis, And quen þou hopis all-þir hiest to haue all þar will, I sall þe sett o? a saute &amp; sla þe [with] my handis. And so sall, fole, for þi folez be fenyshit on dawes. For-þi for pompe or for pride þi purpose a-vise, For yf þou shote ouer sheet þou shendes þi flayne. Turne þe, trechoure, be-time þat þou na treson haue, And drawe a-gay? to þi de? vndire þi dam wyngis. Se quat I send to þe, so? þi-selfe with to laike, A hatt &amp; a hand-ball &amp; a herne-panne; Slike presandis to play with as pertines to babbis. For ai a child mot him chese to childire geris; For mestire &amp; miserie vnneth may þou forthe Þine awen caitefe cors to clethe &amp; to fede, And supposis as a sott to sese oure landis, And outhire darius to drepe or dryfe fra his kythis! Bot by þe grace &amp; þe gude þat god gaue my fadire, So riued is þe rede gold oure regions with-in, Þat qua sa had it on a hepe haly to-gedire, It wald vs let, as I leue þe li?t of þe so?! For-þi bid I þe badrich on bathe twa þine e?en, And o? þe plegg &amp; þe pay? &amp; perill as folowis, All þi vanyte to voide &amp; þi vayne pride, And mew agay? to Messedone or any mare fall. For be þe saule of my sire bot if þou sone turne, We sall þe send sike a soume of segis en-armed, No?t as Philips fant salle fare with þi-selfe, Bot as a prince of proued theues pyne þe to dede.” Als sone as his sandismen to þis sire come, Þai present him þe playntis þe pistill him rechis, And Alexander belyue be-fore all his princes, To all his ost euy? o? he openly declaris. And quen his kni?tis of þis clause þe carpe vndirstode, Þen ware þai frekly a-frayd of þe fell sa?es; And as sone as him-selfe sa?e his seggis amoued, In bilding of his bachelers he breuys þire wordis: “Quat now? my worthi werriouris sa wi?t &amp; sa noble, Mi bernes &amp; my baratours þe best vndire heuen; Lettis neuire it bro?t be o? brade for vpbraide of schame, ?e doute for þe indityngs of Darius pistils.

For-þi vs buse to be bigg &amp; bataill him ?eld, Þe grete garisons of gold sall gedire vp oure hertis.” With þat comands þe kyng his kny?tis be-lyue, Þe donesmen þat fra Darius come with þe derfe lettir, Þat þai suld titly þam take &amp; by þe to?e throtis, And for þaire souerayne sake þam send to þe galawis. Þan was þa messangers a-maied as mervale ware ellis, With kene carefull crie þis conquirour þai said: “Allas! quat lake lyse in vs lord if it be ?oure will, Þus causeles for oure kynge encumbird to worthe?” “The sa?es of ?our soueray?” said þe kynge þe?, “Nedis me to slike notis as I had neuer etlid, Þat has ?ow sent to my-selfe no?t sa as him a?e; Loo ‘litill thefe’ in ilka lyne his lettir me callis.” “?a,” quod þai, “comly kyng” &amp; o? knes fallis, “Þase ditis endited to ?owe sir Darius him seluy?, For he knew no?t of ?our kni?thede ne of ?our kid strenth; Ne wist no?t of ?our worthenes &amp; wrate all þe baldire. Bot wald ?e grant vs to gaa &amp; gefe vs ?our lefe, Þen suld we bremely ?our bill to þe berne shewe.” Þen lete þe lord þa? allane &amp; went till his fest, Takis þa? with him to his tent &amp; þa? at ese makis. Sone as þai in his sale were sett at þe table, “Sire Alexander, athill kyng” quod all with a steuy?, “Comands with vs to caire kni?tis a thousand, And we sall surely oure sire þe send in þaire handis.” “?a, make we blis,” quod þe kyng “blithe mote ?e worthe, For as for takynge of ?our lord sall na lede wynde.” To Darius anoþir day enditis he a pistill, A crest clenly inclosid þat consayued þis wordis. Alexander, þe aire &amp; eldest childe bathe Of kyng Philip þe fers þe fendere of grece, And als of Olimpades þat honurable lady, To þe, Darius, o? dese þus dite I my lettir. Þou prince of all þe Persyns þat peres to þe sonne, Þe conquirour of ilka cost callid of þi-selfe, With all þi gracious godis graithid i? þi trone, All þus I send to ?owe I my sawe vndir my sele wrete?. Sire, if we se with a suth surely me thinke, Oure facultes, oure faire fees oure fermes &amp; our landis, We may no?t chalang þa? ne clayme ne call þaim oure awen, Bot all I deme it as det &amp; to a day borowid. For sen we riden on þe rime &amp; o? þe ringe sete? Of þe qwele of Fortoun, þe quene þat swiftly changis, Ofte pas we in pouert fra plente of gudis, Fra mirthe in-to mournyng fra mournyng in-to Ioye. For now vs wantis in a qwirre as þe quele turnes; Que? we suppose in oure sele to sit alþir heist, Þa? fondis furth dame Fortoun to þe flode-?atis, Dra?es vp þe damme-borde &amp; drenchis vs euire. For-þi a we þat has wit þofe he wele suffir, So sadly in soueraynete he set neuire his hope For pride of na pro[s]perite ne prise at hi? folewis, To olle ay o? his vndireling for ouer-laike a quyle. For any sele vndire son a sott I him hald, Þat ay has deyne &amp; dispite at dedis of litill, Sen oft þe hauenlest here is houen to þe sternes, And he þat graithist is of gudis gird all to poudire. For-þi a depe dishonoure ?e do to ?oure name, Ane emperoure þat o? erth is euy? to ?oure-selfe, To me sa litill &amp; sa lawe slike lettirs to sende, And presand out of Persy bot for a pure hethyng. For þou enherestis all þis erth &amp; euens to þe so?, And callis þe kyng of ilka kithe vndir þe cape of heuen, And þarto sittis, as þou sais in sege as ane Aungell, To-gedire with þi grete gods and o? a gilt trone. Bot syn gostid godesses &amp; gods ere graythid neuir to dye, Bot ai sall last furth elike o?-lyue ouire mare, Þai naue no will to my notis ne wilnyng to haue, No dole ne no daliance of dedely bernes. Bot I knaw I am coruptible &amp; caire ?ow agaynes, Als with a dedly duke to do my bataill; Bot þof þou þe victor a-vaile na vaunte sall arise, Ne lose, bot as a litill thefe ?ow limpid to encumbre. Bot chance it me, þat am a childe þe cheuer to worthe, So þat be geuyn me þe gree grete glorie is myn awe?. For þan sall spring vp þe speche &amp; sprede out of mynd, How I haue conquired a kyng þe kidest of þe werd. Bot a tale ?e me tald I trow be na faile, Of þe ryfenes of þe rede gold ?our regio? with-i?, Quilke plente is in Persy of perell &amp; of ellis, Þe somme of siluer &amp; of siche &amp; of sere stanes, Þare-with oure wittes has þou wele &amp; oure will sharpid, And blid with þi besands þe bataill to ?eld, Made vs corageous &amp; kene ?oure clere gold to wy?, And put a-way oure pouert ?e plede vs to hald. Bot as touchand þe trufils þat ?e to me sent, Þe herne-pan, þe hand-ball þe hatt made of twiggis, Þare has þou prophesid apert &amp; playnely vs schewid, And faire affirmed vs before þat sall fall eftir. For by þe ball, sir, I breue all þe brode werd, Þe erthe at to myne enpire enterely bees ?olden. And be þe hat, þat is holewe be-for þe heued bowed, I constru þat ilka kyng sall clyne to my-selfe. Þan hope I by þe hernepa? þat þe hede couirs, Ouir-comers to be callid &amp; ouire-comen neuire. Now þou, þe grettest vndir god graithis me trouage, With all þis dignites be-dene þat I diuined haue.” Þis brefe bedis þaim him bere &amp; besands þam rechis; And eftir armes all his ost &amp; airis o? eftir forthire. Sire Darius for þe ditis nere died he for angire, To twa of þe derrest of his dukis ditis he þis pistill: “I, þe corounnest kyng of kyngis all othire, To þe, sir primus, a prince of Persye þe grettest, And als to ser Antagoyne my? awe? athill dukis, Þe soueraynest of my seniourie my saroparis hatten, Se here I send ?ow my seele with salutis of ioye. Fra Alexander þe kyng as I am in-fourmed, Is entrid with oure enmys a? endles nounbre, Þe Anglies of Asie &amp; has þa? all stroyed, For-þi of life &amp; o lym my lege men I charge To prestli ?ow apparaill &amp; pas þam agaynes, With all þe hathils &amp; þe heris &amp; þe hi?e maistris Þat ?e may semble in þe sidis saudiours &amp; othire.

For it a?e no?t slik ane Asald nane abletus to off werres, Bot at þe bowlis as a brode or with a ball playe.” Þire princes, sone as þe pistill was put þa? in hand, Þan part þai þe proud sele þe printe þai adhoured, Vn-lappis li?tly þe lefe &amp; þe line redes, And þus-gate agynward þai graithid him anothire. “To þe kiddest kyng to a-count of kyngis all othire, Sire Dari, with þi dere godis drised o? þi trone, Gouernoure of ilk a gome &amp; god all þi-selfe, Þi satrapairs, þi seniours with seruage obesche?: Sire, wetis it wele, ?oure worthines &amp; wenys it na langire, Þat þis child, with his chiftans þat ?e charge vs to take, Has reden all oure regions &amp; raymed oure landis, Departid all oure prouynce &amp; purely it wastid.

Sire Darius for þa ditis was depely a-greuyd, Callis him his consail a clause he him enditis, Mas a brefe at a braide &amp; it in brathe sendis, To Alexander as be-lyue &amp; all þus him gretes. “I, sir Dari, þe deyne &amp; derfe Emperoure, Þe kyng of kyngis I am callid &amp; conquirour bathe, Of all lordis þe lord a-lose þur?e þe werd, And ane of þe souerayne sires vndir þe vij sternes, To þe, my seruand, I send &amp; suthely þou knawes, And wete þou wele þur?e all þe werde is wirschip oure name.

Nonus passus Alexandri. “Alexsaundere þe athill aire oute [of] grece, Þe so? of Ph[ilip] þe fers &amp; of his faire lady, Honoured Olimpadas þe oddest vndire heuyn, To þe, ser Dari, o? þi dese þis dities I write.

Þan Alexander belyue with his athill dukis, Rais him radly to ride &amp; remowis his ost; Fra þe streme of struma he stre?tis &amp; still mournes, And mevis him toward Messedone his modir to visit. He aires þur?e Arabie &amp; armed þar he findis A duke of Darys þe kyng þat drafe him agayne, A pere out of Persy &amp; prince of his ost, A maister man in þa marches Amont was hatten. He girdis him with a ging þe grekis he asailes, With Alexander all day asperly fe?tis, Marres of þe Messedons mi?tfull kni?tis, Dingis doun of þe dukis deris þam vn-faire, Fra morne to þe mirke ni?t maynly þa cocke?, Se?es doun o? aythire side segis out of nounbre.

Þus thre dais out a thraw þai thre? ay elike; So lange, sais me þe lyne lastid þe bataill, Sike scoures were of blude of schondirhed bernes, Þat foles ferd in þe flosches to þe fetelakis; Sa store &amp; stithe was þe stoure þe story me tellis, Þat for soro?e of þe si?t þe so? o? þe heuen Kest away his clerete &amp; his clippis suffirs, For bale to blische o? þe blode at on þe bent flo?es. With þat oure gomes out of grece gedirs vp þar hertis, Fey fallis in þe fild fele of þire othire, Þe pouwere of Persy i? partis many Se?es sidlings doun slay? of þaire blonkis. And quen þe duke of ser Darys þa dedis be-haldis, Amonta þe mi?tfull his men þa? he fangis, And vneth limpid him þe lee þe lyne me recordis, Fra his faes with a fewe þe filde to de-voide. And slike a pas, sais þe prose to Persy he ridis, Þat ?it þe selfe sandismen he in þe sale fyndis, Þat fra þe streme of struma were apon stedis wysid Fra Alexander &amp; his ost with his athill pistill. And ?it ser dary o? his dese þa dities a-visis, Held þe lettir in his loue &amp; at þe ledis fraynes, Quat he said of þe sedis þat he him-selfe sent. And þai swiftly him sward &amp; swyth þus him tellis: “Þe kyng him ka?t,” quod þe kni?tis “&amp; on þe cornes bitis, And wele he geses be þe graynes ?oure gomes ere fele, Bot a thing, he said, he sa?e þat solast him maste, Þai ware bot soft, he suposed for so þe sede proued.” Þan pullis him vp þe proude kyng &amp; o? þe pepire tastis, Said, as it tuke him by þe tonge “his tulkis ere fewe, Bot, be his kni?tis as kene as me þis cornes shewis, All þe werd war to waike his wrothe to with-stand.” Þe mody ma? Amonta þan melis þir wordis, “?is, he ledis bot a lite lord, with ?oure lefe; Þare is bot fewe at him folo?es bot fe?tand bernes, Bot mare fersere in feld fell neuire of modire. For I my-selfe with a sowme set þaim agayns, With of þe Persyns proude a pake out of nounbre, Felire þa? his folke be full fyue thousand, And ?it vs fell all to ferre þe fayntir to worthe; For þai haue hedid of oure hathils &amp; a hepe woundid, Fey falne to þe fold many fers erlis, Bet doun oure bachelers my banir to-rased, And a selly somme slayne of my kni?tis. Quethire days thre þur?e-out thraly we fo?te?, Derfe dintis &amp; dre?e delt &amp; take?, And ?it þe lawest at þe last vs limpid to bee, And vnethis sauyd I my-selfe vn-slay? of þar handis.

For mekely ilka modire so? his awen me? &amp; othire, Als wele þe pure Persens as þe grete grekis, All þe douth at was dede be-dene he comands To gedire þa? vp ilka gome &amp; þam in grauys ligg.” Now Alexander &amp; his ost armed o? ridis, And sone Cecile he with his seggis entrid, Þar sere citis of þa sidis to him-selfe sweren, And saudiours him to sewe seuyntene thousand. Þan ?ede he ouire in-to ane Ile Yssanna was hatte?, And þat was ?apely him ?euyn &amp; ?olden be-lyue. Þan vp he clame to a cliffe þat to þe cloudis semed, Þe Tor of Tare to taken þe tretis it callis, Þare fand he tildid o? þe top &amp; tild vp a cite, Þe proud tou? of Persopole &amp; to þe place he ne?es. Þare sa?e he selcuthis sere as þe buke sais, Þe muses of musike &amp; þe merke how it was made first. Þan aires he in-to Asie &amp; ai as he fonndis, All þe citis of þa sidis he sesis þam clene, So fares he furth to Frigie a-noþire faire Ile, And ane þar of his ald gods he honourd in a temple. Þan ferd he furth to a Flum was fyue cubetis brad, Scamandra þe slire flode þe scriptour it callis. “Now happy be ?ee,” quod þe hathill “all in hert beris Þe honouris of þat odd clerke Homore þe grete.” “Mekill dere,” quod ane Doctoneus “of ?ow I deme sall, And he of þe takyng of Troi tald all his lyue.” “Nay, I wald more worth,” quod þe [wee] “a wyse man disc[i]ple, Þa? þe honour þat Acheles a?t all his time.” Þa? moves he him to Messedone with his mony princes, Amendid of hire malidy his modire he fyndis, A litill dais with hire lengis &amp; of hire lyfe ioyes, And graythes him þan with his gere &amp; a-gayn fondis. He passes o? to-ward Persy &amp; pi?t doun his tentis Besyd a bur?e at þe buke Abandra me? callis. Þai fall on freschly þe folke of þe cite, And barris bremely at a bur?e þe foure brad ?atis. Þan takis þe kyng his kni?tis vmlapis þe wallis, Settis vp-on a saute o? sidis eno?e; Bot, for þe cite was vnsure þe seggis withi? Mi?t no?t þe braidis a-bide of bernes enarmed. Þan cries all to þe kyng “ser conquirour,” þai said: “Ne steke we no?t oure stiff ?atis ?our strenthe to defend, Bot for dred of ser Dary þe derfe Emperoure, Lest, had we haldit to ?our heste he had vs eft wastid.” “?a, werpis þam vp,” quod þe wee “&amp; wyde open settis, If at ?e shap ?ow to shount vnschent of oure handis. For quen I done haue with Dary &amp; my dede fenyschid, Þan sall I tell ?ow my tale how it sall tide eftir.” So baiste þam þe bald kyng with his breme wordis, Þat þai vn?arked him þe ?atis &amp; ?ald hi? þe keys. Þe bur?e þus of abrandra he with his men takis, To take &amp; leue quat him list &amp; lendis o? forthire. Þen wyndis he to A wath tou? was Wyothy hatte?, And come so to Caldipol anoþer kid cite, So to the watir of wintir as it þe writte callis. Þare nere was fey for defaute enfamyschist his ost, Kni?tis kest vp a crie &amp; kenely þa? menes: “Loo, oure foles ere in fere fodeles to dye;” Þai pleyne more þe pouirte &amp; þe pite of þar horsis Þa? þe soro?e of þa?-selfe by þe seuynt parte. “Quat ailes ?ow?” quod Alexander to his athill dukis, “Mi barons &amp; my baratorus þe biggest in erth, Þat has þe angwisch of armes ay to now suffird; Quethire euire ?oure hertis, I hope for horsys abatis? May vs no?t limp, if any life lenge i? oure brestis, To couer be cas at a cleke courseris a thousand? And vs demed be þe dome to die of þe werd, Þan standis in stede no?t of a stra all þe store stedis. For-þi I rede,” quod þe renke “we ride o? forthire, And pas to sum othire place þare plente is in, Þat we may fange at þe full þe fude at vs wantis.” And bath our folk &amp; owr folex fyll þaire wambes.” Þa? prekis he furth with his princes to slike a play? wendis, Luctus it hi?t, þe letterure &amp; þe line þus it callis; Þare his forrayouris fand þe fulth of vitaill, Bathe to berne &amp; to blonk bide que? him likid. When he was full þare &amp; fedd he flittis with his ost, To Tergarontes he te?e þare ti?t was a mynstre; He pi?t doun his pauilio? &amp; passis to þe temple, Sire Appoline to adoure &amp; othire ald goddis, To offire i? þat oritorie with honour he wyndis, And sum of þa? at spire how he spede suld. Bot sone ane ?acora him said a semely summe, Þan was na? honour of answaringis bot on a-noþere bide. Þan dose him furth þe dere king &amp;, o? þe day eftire, He se?is to þe Synagog &amp; sacrif[is]e makis, And Appoline als beliue him aykewordly swaris, ‘Sire Ercules þe Emperoure’ he euire in ane callis. Þa? Alexander all in ire angrily spekis: “Now fynd I wele,” quod þe freke “þat fals ere þi wordis, Now þou neuyns me a new name at I neuire hi?t; And þou a god,” quod þe gome “þat is grete ioye!” Þa? sekis he furth with a somme &amp; to A cite wyndis, Þe toun Thebea þe tretis it callis, And þare he biddis all þe bur?e þat foure bald kni?tis Suld be lett with him lend &amp; lenge in his weris. Þen tened þe Thebees folke &amp; tynd to þe ?atis, And to with-stand his strenthe ste?id to þe wallis, Bad him bow o? be-lyue &amp; bide þare na laingire; For if he did, withoute? dome þe deth þai him hi?t. Þan fangis him vp þe fell kyng a fuyll feyned la?tir, Said, “?e of Tebet ere tried þe tethiest o? erth, Of all þe seggis vnder so? þat citi?ens hatt; Mast hi?e ?e ere hersid &amp; herid of ?oure strenthe. And nowe sa ?ape me? as ?e þe ?atis hase stoken, And me &amp; þe pruddest of my princes proferne vs werre; And at ?e so will, I-wis wondire me thinke, For þus wald neuer at ?e wro?t þe wirsci? of armes. It contraries kni?thede ?e knaw wele ?our-selfe, To any wi?t werriours in wallis þam to close. For he þat kid is &amp; kene &amp; couettis a name, Will fe?t fersely in fild his famen agayns.” Þan Alexander be-liue all a-boute þe cite, Makis foure thousand with flanes &amp; bowis, Biddis þam to bend vp brathly with arowis To wonde þe wees with-in þat on þe wallis houys. And twa thousand be tale he titely comaundis, Of wele buskid bernns in brenys &amp; platis, All þe sidis of þe cite þat sechus had biggid, And Amphion, a? athill kempe onane to distruy. A full thousand he fangid to fire þe foure ?atis, And thre thousand of thra me? to thraw with engynes. Him-selfe of slingis &amp; slike a-semblis a me[n]?e, To heede &amp; help of his hyne if any harme lympid. Now ere his seggis all sett &amp; þe saute ne?is, Were wakens be-twene werbild in trompis; Oure pepill with pay?s pressis to without, Halis vp hem? cordis hurled out arowis; Othire athils of armes Albastis bendis, Quirys out quarrels quappid thur?e mayles. Sum with gunnes of þe grekis girdis v? stanes, To tene þe Tebis folke þat o? þe touris fe?tis; Sum braide ouir þe barrers in blasand wede, And faire fest on a fire all þe foure ?atis; All þe bur?e at a braide was on a bale kyndild, And þa þat sounde ware vnslay? als sottes þa? ?eldis. Þan with-out in oure ost as þe buke tellis, A Sire, at Sicistrus was callid be name, A meri man, a Messangere þat maynly was ioyd To se þe cite be sa sone sindid to brandis. Anothre hathill vndire hand þat Hismon was callid, Ane a maistre of musike a man of þe cite, Aires to ser Alexander &amp; in his hert wepis, As qua sai, “prince, of oure place sum pete þou haue.” Þan lokis þe lord to þe lede said, “lettrid berne, Quare-to feynys þou þis fare for-with myne e?en?” “Sire conquirour,” quod þe clerke “?oure corage to bend, And in ridding of oure riche toun ?our reuth for to call.” Þan was þe wale kyng wrath &amp; wi?tly comaundis To bete in-to þe bare erth all þe bur?e-walles; And quen all kynd was o? colis &amp; kast apon hepis, Þan airis he on with his ost mare honour to wyn?. A Ientill ma? full ioyles iournais him eftir, Folo?es þare fare ai o? fote as þai ride, A sege at of þe same toun sire was &amp; maistre, Ane callid was Cletomacus to crie eftir socure, His ledis at left ware o-lyue a lite of þe cite. Þan askid at sire Appoline al with a steuen, “If euire it worthe sall to wee quen þe werd stand, Oure bu[r]?e agay? for to bigg þat bretted is to no?t?” Þan gales þaire god a-gay? &amp; þus spekis: “Þe tulke þat tilld ?our toun sall tield vp &amp; rere, Sall thre times haue þe thra of sum threuy? gome Of were ore of wristilling for þus has wirid shape?. And quen þat wirschip is wo? within a wale time, Þan sall he sett vp him-selfe þe cite as be-forne.” Þus answars þa? þaire ald gode &amp; osses o? þis wyse, And þai als fayne, all þe flote as fowell of þe day. Þan aires on ser Alexander with his athill princes, To þe castell of Corynthi he comes with his ost, With þe Pers of þa partese to play on þe toures, As all þe sires of þa sidis him-selfe had required. Þe multitude ware sa miche of men for to reke?, Þat þare was sembild &amp; sett þat si?t to be-hald. Quod Alexander bilyue to all at þare stode, “Quat gome sall þis gamme? begin apon first?” Þan comes forth Cletomacus &amp; to þe kyng swaris, Þe tulke out of Thebie I tald ?ow be-forne, “If it ?oure mekill maieste mi?t any thinge plese, I wald to wacken ?oure welth now wirstill a turne.” Þan mas þe prince him a place &amp; prestly him matches, And he him girdes to þe grounde &amp; þe gree wynnes. “Now faithly,” quod þe fell kyng “fall þe so thrise, Þou sall be crouned, or I caire for kiddest of þe game?.” Þan ?ede he eftsones to &amp; his euen kastis, Thringis to þe thrid time &amp; þe thra wynnys. And þan comandis him þe kyng a coroune o? hede, As for þe prise of þe play putfull of stanes; Þan bad him beddels belyue: ‘breue vs þi name.’ “Sirres, by my sothe,” quod þe segge “Sitiles I hi?t.” “Qwi so, my worthe werstillare?” þe wale kyng said, “How tidis it þe &amp; tou[n]les þi toname is callid?” “Mi louely lorde,” quod þe lede &amp; law him declines, “Be-for ?e come slike a kyng &amp; þe croune werrid, I had a cite my-selfe &amp; segges I-nowe; And sethen ?e a?t þis enpire I am it all priued.” Þan trowid trewly þe kyng þat Theby he menyd, And beddels &amp; bailyfs he bad on brad crie, Be-fore his pupill apert þe powere him grauntis To sett his cite vp agay? &amp; of him-selfe halde?. Þa? passis he to a proude tou? Platea was hatte?, Þare was sti?tild ane Strasageras þat was a stiffe prince, Duse him in with his dukis to Dyanaas temple, And fand a pure prophetas aparaild i? vailes. And scho, as sone as scho him sa?e said him þir wordis: “Welco? we, at all þe werd sall wy? with þi handis.” Þe secund day before þe so? he at þe cite wildid, In-to þe temple he turned tythandis to herke?; “Quat ware þi will, ser, to wete?” þe woma? frayned; “Þou lesis all þi lordschi? within a lite dais.” “Quat, &amp; has þou ossed to Alexander þis ayndain wirdes, And me þus ill? vn-ably þine abet þou weris.” “Nay, tene ?ow no?t, for treuly þus tide bose it nede.” And so it worthid, for in a wrath þe wale kyng swyth Him of his principalete priued &amp; þa? þe prince fondis Onane to Athenas &amp; o? þe athill playntes; And þai said, soure suld him sowe bot he þe cite ?eld. And Alexander with his ostes aires on forthire, Ateynes him to-ward þe termes &amp; of þar tene heres, And slike a word he þaim wayues be writ fra him-self. And qua so will has to wete how it worthid eftir, Here sall I tell þa? at loues to here forthire. Decimus passus Alexandri. “I Alexander, þe aire &amp; eldest childe hatte? Of kyng Philip þe fers þat fest a? i? grece, And of þe quene Olimpades þe oddest vnder heuen, To all ?ow of Athenes þus etill I my sa?es. Fra þat my fadere was fey &amp; farne out o lyue, And I was sett in his sege with septour to regne, Sethen went I with my werriours in-to þe west endes, And ay with-out any armes þaim all at anys ?olden, All Europe to my? enpire enterely þaim geuy?, Euyn to þe Occiane out of ald Rome. Qua þat vs rekinly resayues na riddour þai tholid, And all at othire wais wro?t we wast þa? for euire. And now fra þe marche of Messedone I meued opon late Þur?e þe anglis here of Afle with myne athill dukis, And so þe Thebies þam ti?t þe toun to defende, And I þar pompe &amp; þaire pride to poudire declined.

A Filisphire þan o? first before þe folke risis, Ane Eschilus in erde &amp; ernstly he spekis, Þe douth &amp; all diuinours be-dene he comaundis, Þat þai suld corde be na cas vn-to þe kingis hestis. With þat all samen on a sop? semblis þe pupill, A doctour, ane Domystyne þai derely beseke To consaile þaim als i? þe cause &amp; ken þam þe best. And he rekinly rase &amp; rekyns þire wordis: “I be-seke ?ow now, my citi?ens if þat ?e safe vouche, Bot sobirly a sete quile my sa?es for to here.

Þe dities of Domestiane so did he bathe, Þat comaundid &amp; his comandmentis to kepe in all wyse, ?it neuire-þe-lattir to þa ledis a lettir he fourmed, In presidine with his awen prince reportand þa wordis: “I, kyng Philip so? þe fers &amp; his faire ladis, Honoured Olimpades þat I obesche maste, I kepe neuire king to be callid ne cache me þat name, Till all þe barbarine blude a-bowe to þe grekis. I etill neuir Athenes with armes for to entre, Bot ?ow to questio? enquere &amp; qwete with my wittis.

Bot quilk as first of ?ow foundis a fote vs agayne, Sall neuir deuoide my dedeyne ne my derfe ire. And ?e at wickid ere withi? ay wickidly ?e thinke; For as þe grayne is in þe grape growis þe frutis. Þe Tebies tulkid vs with tene a-tired þa? in armes, ?it rad for all þaire rebelte resayued þai þaire medis. And for Strasagera þe stoute ?e stithli me blamed, Þare as he gilt me agayns &amp; I him gradid haue, I wrate to ?ow at me to wayue be te? wyse clerkis; ?e kest out comaundmentis ?e knew no?t my strenth. I mi?t a-coupe of þat cause if I it kythe wald; Bot I for-geue ?ow all þe gilt &amp; greues me na mare. For-þi bees glad now, all þe gingis ?e sall na gref haue, Þe diuinour domestyne for ?e his domes held.” Fra þai consayued had þe clause &amp; construed þe lettir, Þai ware þe meriest modirsons on morne mi?t ryse. Now fonndis furth þe fell kyng &amp; flittis with his ostes, Lendis him to Lacedoyne a litill fra þe cite, With-out þe bur?e o? a banke he bildis his tentis, And þare him-selfe with a somme in a sege le[n]gis. Þe ledis out of Lacedone belyue þam asemble, Said, “bow we neuir to his bode for bale apon erth, Ne lat vs neuir be sa lethire at we like worthe To þam of Ateynes it is oure opyn schame; For þai ware baist of his bost bredid for no?t; Bot be we kni?tly &amp; kene oure corage to schew.” With þat þai ?arkid to þe ?atis &amp; ?ode to þe wallis, Sum in Iopons, sum in Iesserantis sum Ioyned all in platis. A grayne of þe grete see þaim aboute glidis; For-þi buskis þa? þe burgh a bataill with-out, Preses furth at posternes in-to þe porte wyndis, Schalkis scott in-to shipis all in shire mailes; Archars with arows with attrid barbis, Gais þam in-to galays &amp; grathis þam be-forne. Bowes bernes in-to bargis with basinettis o? heued, Sparrethis spetous to spend &amp; speris in handis, Þai crosse ouir toward þe kyng as kyndmen suld, With as feyle o? þe flode as fo?ten with-in. Þe lord him lokis o? þe ledis &amp; a litill smyles, And sent twa vndir his seele þir sa?es in a pistill. “I, Philip so? þe fell kyng as I first sayd, And als of Olimpades I anely ?ow rede, Þat þe end of ?oure eldirs enterely ?e be-hald, And roomes no?t at þe ray[n]bowe þat reche ?e ne may, And þe powere of þe Persens so truly ?e traist. Lat se now, getis ?ow a name &amp; naytis ?our stre[n]the; Bot bowis first fra ?our bargis &amp; blythly þaim wayfe, For, fest I all on a fire þe foly is ?oure awe?.” Ledis out of Lacedone quen þai þe lettir redd, Were drery, bot for all þe dole þa di?t þaim to fi?t. With þat þe kyng &amp; his kni?tis vm-clappis þe cite, Settis all þe gailis on gledis &amp; girdis doun þe wallis; Þe citi?ens &amp; seriantis at vne-slayne ware Bowis þam to þis baratour bodis &amp; lyuys. “?e knaw wele,” quod þe conquirour “my comyng was esye; Bot for ?e fangid me no?t faire fired is ?our schippis, ?our bur?e is bretind &amp; ?our bernes I bed ?ow my-selfe, ?e suld no?t stody ne ste? þe sternes for to handill. For he þat steppis on a stee que? þe staues failis, Þan fautis him festing to his fete &amp; fall him be-houes; So, ri?t as Sexis was slay? sum time with ?our eldirs, So ettild ?e ser Alexander bot þare ?oure ame failes.” Quen he þis sa?e had þam said þe cite he þam grauntid, Fondis furth with his folke þar fraunches þa? leues. Þis soueray? with his seggis þur?e Sycile he wyndis, Þo?t to ride &amp; to rayme þe regions of barbres. Þan was ser Darius dred &amp; sembled derf ostis, His kni?tis, his consaill &amp; carpis þire wordis, Said: “lo! my seris, now may se ?our-selfe with ?our e?e?, How Alexander in his armes all-way encreses, In valour &amp; in victori &amp; vertues so noble; Þare as I thret him as a thefe thedis to dispoyle, Now werrays he full worthily as wi?t man suld, Constreynes with his contenance kni?tis to him bow. Þe mare I spek him dispite &amp; in my speche hindire, Þe hi?ere I here him enhansed &amp; hersude his name. A ball &amp; a her?epa?

For-þi vs haue bos in hert þe hele of oure pupill, And for na pompe ne na pride his person dispice, For his lose, for all his litillaike is loued þur?e þe werd. And þe mare I myn oure maieste þe mare it abatis, Þe grace of þe grete god I ges, will him help, Of prise þe hi?e prouynce vn-to þis prince leues. Quen we hope althire-hi?est to hery him with armes, Þan am I redd all oure rewme be reft vs for euire.” Sone as ser Dary till his dukis deuysid had þir wordis, Þan answars him ane Oriathire ane of his awen brethire, “Þou has þis gome out of grece so gretly e[n]hansid, Þat we Elanda suld leue &amp; he þis landis entre. Bot wald ?our maieste þe maners of þis man sewe, ?e mi?t ?oure rewme haue i? ryst &amp; othire rewmes wy?. For Alexander all-ways or any of his erles, Naytis him-selfe in ilke nede &amp; so his name rysis.” “Quat sall I take of hi? my temes tittire þan he myne?” “Sire, on my perell,” quod a prince “he passes all othire; Þe wee wirkis all be witt he worthis þe bettir; For-þi of þe lio?, as I leue la?t is his birthe.” “Quat knawis þou þat?” quod þe kyng &amp; þen þe kni?t swaris: “Sire, I was sent on a sand my-sell o? a time, To Philip his fadere to feche oure trouage; Þare had I si?t of þe segg his sapient I herde. For-þi plese it to ?our person ?oure princes a-sembles, Of Mede of Mesopotane þe men of Itaile, Þe pupill of Appolomados þe panthis folke, And ma þat houes to ?our hest a hundreth &amp; fifti. Lat vs gedire þus oure gomes oure gods will vs help; And quen he sesse vs sike a sowme sare will he drede. ?a, bot a wolfe, quod a wee will were many flokkis, And so þe grace of þe grekis ouire-gos þe barbers.” Be þis ser Ph[ilip] so? þe fers of fe?tand folk Had semblid ane v?sene sowme as þe buke sais, Twa C. Mille in thede all of threuen kni?tis. Ridis furth i? aray removis his tentis; And thought to loge þar &amp; rest &amp; ease hym þat nyght. Vn-to a watere he wendis as þe buke tellis, Þat with þa marchesmen Mocia? was hatte?; It was clerire þan cristall &amp; cole as a chill; Þare-in couet oure kyng his cors for to bathe. With þat þan wan of his wede &amp; weschid him all ouire, Quare-þur?e he hent slike a harme at hatirly him greued. Þis chele eftir chaufing enchafis so his hernes, Þat he was fallen in a feuire or he first wend. Þan mourned all þe Messedons as meruaill ware ellis. Þai sa?e him so to be seke said ilkane to othire: “Be þis disese to ser Darie &amp; his dukis knawe?, He sall vs sett o? a-saute &amp; surely en[c]ounbre.” If þai were sary &amp; so na selly me thingke, For ay þe hele of þe hede helpis all þe menbris. Þan callis to him þe conquirour a clerke of his awe?, Ane Philip, his fesisiane his fare to behald; Of al manere of medcyne man þat maste couthe, A ?onge berdles barne as þe buke tellis, Said: “lat li?tly my lord for in a litill stonde My-self with a sero? sall saue ?ow be-lyue.” Þan permeo? þe proude a prince of his ost, Þat held þe erth of Ermonye &amp; enmyte hadd Vn-to þis clerke of þe kyngis &amp; be no cause els Bot for þe lede was loued &amp; with þe lord chereschest; Þan ames he to ser Alexander on ane slike a pistill: “Kepis ?ow,” quod he, “conquirour &amp; caches no?t his drenke; For Darius eftir his deth his do?ter has him hi?t, And ?ow to sla be so? sle?t to sese him his landis.” ?it was þe berne no?t a bene baist of his wordis, He asurid him so sadly þe serep he takis, Þe licor in his awen looue þe lettir in þe tothire, And in-to Phili[pi]s face fast he behaldis. He bad him dred neuire a dele &amp; it drink swyth, And þan þe pistill of þe prince he put him in hand. Þe leche lokid ouire þe lynes “my lording,” he said, “I am no?t gilty of þis gile be all þe grete gods!” As fast was he fysche-hale &amp; Phili? he callis, Halsis him full hertly &amp; of his hele thankis, Said, “wele knew þou my kynd lufe þi concience, First suposid I of þi serop syne sesid þe þe lettir. “Mi louely lord, be ?our leue lattes him a-pere, Þe tulk at sike a trayne has touchid to my-selfe.” Þan eftir ser Permes his prince prestly he sendis, And þare þe trechoure was tane &amp; for his trayne hedid. Þa? mouys he furth with his me? &amp; Medy he wynnys Enterly to his empire &amp; Ermonye þe mare. Till a dissert þan he drafe was dry &amp; na watere, Þur?e Adriac till Eufraten &amp; ames þare his tentis, And mas a brig ouire þe bourne of Barges with cheynes; Comandis his kni?tis ouire to caire &amp; þar þai vncachid hertis. Þai sa?e þe streme so stife it stonaid þam all, For ferd þe festing suld faile &amp; þai in þe flode droune. Þan mas he laddis ouire to lend &amp; lokars of bestis, And monestis þam ilk modire-so? him maynly to tell. ?it was his baratours a-baist &amp; þen þe berne writhis, Fandis him first on be-fore &amp; all folo?es eftir. Þan passid þare out of Paradese twa proude Flummes, Þur?e Medy &amp; Messopotane þai move, as I fynd, And so to Babilo? þai bowe ane is þe bourne of Tygre, Þe tothire is Eufrates full euen &amp; rynnes so to Sylus. Þan cutis þe kyng in to þe cablis &amp; to his kni?tis sais: “Lo! þof vs fall now to flee we may na ferryre wend; Þare I rede,” quod þe kyng “oure bakis neuir to turne, And if we did, with-outen dome to die all at anes; For he þat folowid has ai þe floure &amp; he at fled neuire. Bees li?t &amp; laches ?ow a lose it is a lord gamen. For I make a-vow at Messedone we sall na mare see, Till all þe barbres vs bow þa? may we blith turne.” Undecimus passus Alexandri. Now has ser Darie þe derfe of dukis &amp; princes Heued vp a hoge ost &amp; fyue hundreth kni?tis Ere chosen to chiftans &amp; chargid þaim to lede; Trottis him o? to Tigre &amp; þare his tentis settis; Þa? mett þai on þe oþire morne with a mekill nombre, Sire Alexander þe hathill armed o? blonkis. Þe multitude ware to me meruaile to reke?, Þat sammed was o? aiþir side many sadd thousand. Now ere þe baners out-bred &amp; þe bate ne?is, Blew bemys of bras buskis to-gedire, Þe crie of þe clarions þe cloudis it persyd; For þe dewt of þe dyn daunced stedis. Bathe þe twa batails bremely assemblis, And aithire segg with his sowme so?t vn-to othire. Kni?tis o? cursours kest þan in fewtire, Taches in-to targetis tamed þaire brenys. Þare was stomling of stedis sticking of erles, Sharpe schudering of schote schering of mailes, So stalworthly within a stond sterid þaim þe grekis, Þat of þe barb[r]yne blod all þe fild flowis. Sone as ser Darie þe deth of his douth sees, Þe pite of þe Persens him prickis in his saule, Sees his mene?e so mynesch &amp; his men fangid, A few þat fresch ware vndefoulid &amp; to þe fli?t tournes. ?it was ane of his ost ane odd ma? of strenth, A burly berne &amp; a bald as þe buke tellis, A segg at he ensurid had to sese him his do?tir, If he mi?t sla with any sle?t þe seniour of grece. He cled him all in clene stele a conyschaunce ouire, Þat made was &amp; merkid o? þe messedone armes, Aires him to ser Alexander in all-þir-mast puple, As he a hathill ware of his behind him he stelis, A bri?t brynnand brand he braidis out of shethe, And þur?e-out þe helme in-to þe hede he hurt him a littill. And þe kni?tis of oure cost as þai þe cas sa?e, Þan fange þai þis ilk freke &amp; be-fore þe kyng bryngis. “Quat now? my worthi werreours?” þe wale kyng said, He wend wele at he ware a wee of his awe?, “Qui has þou brest so my bray? &amp; with a brand wondid ?our sekire seruant in same all were I sire callid, All ware I halden as for hede ?our helpere at nede?” “Nay, hope ?e neuire,” quod þe hathif “ser hi?e emperoure, Me any Messedone to be þou ames of þine awe?, Bot of cruell kind comen of barbres. And þis I did for ser Darius his do?tir me hi?t, And cordid o? þis condicion to couple hire to wyfe, And he went out of þe werd to wild all his regne, To hew þi hede fra þi hals &amp; anys it him shewe.” Þa? callis oure kyng him his kni?tis þaire consaile to fray?, “Quat sall be done him for þis dede?” &amp; þai bedene sware, Sum, at he hangid suld be hi?e sum þe hede priued, Sum bedis in a bale-fire brin him to poudire. “Quat has he fauted?” quod þe frek “þof he him forced haue Þe charges of his chiftan chefely to fill? He þat him demes to þe dede he dampnes him-selfe, And di?tis him his awen dome &amp; þat dare I proue. For demed I any of my douth ser darye to spill, As ?e þis gentill man enioyne suld him be iugid þe?.” He latis þe Persyn in pesse pas with his hele, Mekill for his may? strenth &amp; for his mi?t praysed. As sone as Darye þe derfe of þis dede heris, Þat he was sauyd vnslayne he semblis his kny?tis, Vp to a mi?ti montayne his men þaire he schewis, And gessis him wele þare to degrayd þe grekis maistir. Þa? fandis he furth in-to þe fild &amp; fled als beliue, And Alexander with his ost him asperly folowed Ri?t to þe bu[r]?e of Batran &amp; bildid þare his tentis, Mas him glad with his ginge &amp; to his godis offirs. Þe cite þan he assailid &amp; sesid o? þe morne, With all þe bur?es þare a-boute &amp; busked þare his sete. Þare fand he tresour vntald &amp; als þe trew spouse Of ser Dary, bath his dame &amp; all his dere childire. Now dose him fra Darius a dereworth prince, Aires to ser Alexander adoures him lawe, “I haue erdid with ?oure enmy ser emperoure,” he said, “As soiet serued haue I þat sire many sere wyntir; And all my trauaill I tint for tuke I no gudes. Bot wald it now ?our worthines to wend with my-selfe, A ten Mille vs take of tulkis enarmed, I sall ?ow hete in ?oure hand to haue at ?oure will Sire Dary, with þe mast dole of his derfe erles.” “Nay, leue, lat ane,” quod þe lord “þen leue I no straungers, Þat þou be willi in þi witt to werray þine awe?, Ne tell þou me no?t þat tale I trow no?t þi wordis.” Be þis ser Dary fro his dukis deuysid his pistill: Þe kyng of kyngs was callid &amp; clere god bathe, Þus, vndirstand I, was þe stile &amp; sti?t in þare-eftir: “?our satrapaires, ?our seruant with seruand obeschen; Sire, we haue wayued to ?ow writtis ?it write we þe same, How þis maistir of Messedone has on oure marchis entrid, Brynd vp oure biggingis bretted oure kni?tis, And we ouire-sett be to sare to suffire any langire. For-þi ?our dignite bydene we drerily be-seke, A-gayns þe force of oure faa vs forthire a quile.” Que? he had red all þe rawis for rancour he swellis, And out o?-ane to Alexander all þus he writis. “I, Dary, with þe dignite þe diademe of Persee, Of all þe kyngis þe kyng þat corouned was euire, To þe, my seruand, I say as me was sent late, How þi lawnes &amp; þi litillaike þou lickyns to my hi?t. Bot parde, þi prouidence inpossible it semes, A heuy As to be houyn vp to þe sternes, A thing threuy? is &amp; thike &amp; þarnes þe wyngis, And fautis þe fethirhames &amp; þe fli?t-loomes. For-þi þi mynd neuir þe mare lat mounte in-to pride For chance of na cheualry þat þou a-cheued hase. For vertu ne no victori ne vant noght þi-selfe; He þat enhansis him to he?e þe heldire he declynes. I haue herd of þi hendlaike of heraudis &amp; of othire, Of þi noblay now o newe time a-nentes my modire. Bathe to my wyfe &amp; to my barnes quat bounte þou shewis, Quat curtassy &amp; kyndlaike I ken alto-gedire. Bot surely all þe seso? þat þou þa? so pleses, Þou fangis me neuire to þi frynd fyne quen þe likis. And if þou wirke þaim all þe wa &amp; wrak at þou may, Þe mare vnfryndschip þarfore fall sall þe neuire; For-þi to put þam to pyne I pray þe no?t wande, For my? angire on þine arrogance sall at þe last kindill.” Þarfor do þou þi best god forbyd þou spare.” Quen he had lokid ouir þe lines he la?es at his wordis, And ditis agayn to ser Dary þis dete þat folo?es: “I, Alexander, þe eldest &amp; all myne ane Of kyng Ph[ilip] &amp; his fere þat frely lady, Honourd Olimpades þat anely me fosterd, To þe kyng of Persy þis prolouge I write: Sire, vanite &amp; vayne-glori &amp; vices of pride Þa ere þe gaudis, as I gesse þat all gods hatis, And ilka dedly douth þai driffe þa? to punesch, Þat has dri?ten of vndedlynes dra?en þaim to name. Þis similitude to þi-selfe I say all-to-gedire, Þat a-suris so in þi surquitry &amp; sesis neuire-mare To bost ne to blasfeme blyn will þou nouthire. Bot for þi gold &amp; þi gudis a god þou þe makis, Þou vp-braydis me for þe beute þat I þi blod schewid, As to þi modire I mene &amp; to þi mery childir, Þare mas þou þe to malicole &amp; meenes for litill.

If I kid þa? curtassy it come fra my-selfe, Haly of oure awe? hert &amp; of oure hynd thewis; Ne we prid vs for na prouwis predestayned we ere, Oure gods gay? vs þare-to þat gretly þou spises. Latt now þis lettre be þe last &amp; loke to þi-selfe, For sekire &amp; o? my surement I seke ?ow agay?s.” Þis brefe he bedis þam to bere þat bro?t him þe toþire, And takis þa? of his tresoure &amp; twynnes with þaim faire. Quen þai to Persy ware past a pistill he enfourmes, Wrate a writt of his will so sendis to his princes, His seruandis &amp; his seneschalls out of sere rewmes, And þus comandis he þam clene þe kyng his stile. “I, Alexander, þat as aire avaunced is in grece, Þe so? of Ph[ilip] þe fers as I first tald, And als of Olimpades myne honurable modire, Þus send I to my satraparis my princes &amp; my dukes, My pers out of siphagoyne salutis &amp; grace, Of þe sele of Surry my seggis &amp; my? erles, My kni?tis out of Capados &amp; all my kid lordis, Þe ledis out of Landace &amp; all þe landis out-by.

So ne?e þe cite he so?t &amp; sett vp his tentis, Þat thre days to þat thede hi? tharne &amp; na mare. Said: “let ane dryue to Dary &amp; bede him dryffe sone, Or put him to my powere &amp; plede we na langire.” Þe same ni?t in his slepe him soda[n]ly a-perid Amo?, his awe? god in aung[e]ls wyse, In a mery mantill of mervailous hewis, Meuand as a Messedone in Marcure fourme; Said: “vn-to Susys my so? na sandisman þou send, Bot fange my fygour to þe fast &amp; fand furth þi-selfe, Clethe þe with my conyschaunce &amp; for na care drede, I hete þe haly my help na harme sall þou suffire.” Þan slade he sli?ly a-way &amp; he fra slepe ryse, A breme blasand blis in his brist rysys. He knew his kni?tis þat cas &amp; þai him clene redd, Þat he suld graythe him to ga as him his god chargis. Þan callis to him þis conquirour ane of his kid prince[s], Emynelaus, þat his erlis &amp; his ost ledes, Hend &amp; hardy of his hand a huge man of strenthe, And þare-to lede lelist to his lord leuand of lyue. He bad him bou? him belyue &amp; o? a blonk worth, Anoþire foole with him fange &amp; founde with himselfe. Strad vp him-selfe on a stede in starand wedis, And on a cursoure þe kni?t with a collt folo?es. To þe grete flode of Granto? to-gedire þai ride, Þai fand it forsen þaim be-fore a fote-thike yse. Þat is þe streme of Strama with many steds clepid, And ?it þe pure propure name in percynne tonge. Þa? Alexander belyue his wedes he changis, Þis renke with his Ronsees he ridis ouire &amp; leuys. “A! lat me lend with ?ow, lord” þe lede him besekis, “For drede þat angire or a-ventour or any slike fall.” “Nay, houe þou here,” quod þe kyng “vn-to my hame-come. He þat I saw in my slepe sall be my sekire helpe.” With þat he braides o? þe blonke &amp; broches him i? þe syd, Bowis him to-ward þe bur?e as bri?t as ane aungell. Þis reuere at I first rede be rewle of his kynde, As wele in seso? of Somere as in þe sad wintre, And þat is neuer bot o? ni?tis so naytely it fresys, Till any powere to pas or preke o? with stedis. ?it has þe flou?, as I fynd a forelange obrede, And euire-ilke mornyng it meltis for mi?t of þe so?; With slike a reryd þan it rynnes þe romance it witnes, Þat qua so tuke it in þat tyme tint ware for euire. Be þis enproched him oure prince vn-to þe proude cite, Band his blonke at a barrere with-out þe bur?e ?atis. Þe Persyns of his passag was passyngly wondird, And gesses him to be gode for glori of his wedis. “Quat dones man ert þou?” quod Dary &amp; drafe him agayne. “Sire Alexander,” quod þis athill “has all þus me sent, Bedis buske þe to batell quat bade makis þou here? Outhire ?are þe ?apely þar-to or till his ?okke bowe.” “Qweþire þu be he?” quod þe hathill “so hately þou spekis, Þou melis no?t as a minister a messangere bowis; Þou carpis euyn as a kyng þat closid ware in pride. Bot I am dred neuire a dele of all þi bald sa?es. Bot for þi souerayne sake þat sent þe þus hedire, ?it sall þou sit with my-selfe &amp; soupe or þou wynde.” He ra?t him þan be þe arme &amp; reuerence him makis, And to his palais a-pert with princes hi? ledis, Þare aires him in ser Alexander &amp; all þus he thinkis, “Þis ilke bar-bryn berne grete beute me schewys, Þat here þus hyndly be þe hand ledis to his Innes; Þis hame with help of my god I haue sall he[r]eftir.” So silis he furth with þe sire in-to a somere-hall, Þare sesonde was a soper þe sotelest vndire heuen. Sire Darius drawis to þe dese &amp; oþir dere princes, Settis þis sire with him-selfe lete serue þaim to-gedire. Þat bild was all of brynt gold as þe buke tellis, With þe bath, þe bordis &amp; þe benkes bete? of þat ilke. Þe wessell to vyse o? was verraly þe same, And all þe sale of a sute set full of stanes. Þe popill of Persy opon þis prince waitis, Þe litillaike of his like lathely þat þai spyse; Bot þe wisedome &amp; þe worthenes &amp; of þe wale thewis Þat in þat cors was enclosed kend þai full litill. Butlers full besyly bro?t vp þe wyne, In grete gobletis of gold graythid full of ?ymmes; And Alexander belyue as he had ay dronke?, With þat he clekis vp þe coupe &amp; putis in his boso?. Anoþire boll was him bro?t &amp; bathe he deuoydid, And ?it he threw to þe thrid &amp; thrast i? þare-eftir. Sone as þe clientis þat knew at of þe coupe serued, Þai knele doun before þe kyng &amp; him þe cas tald. Þan has ser Dary dedeyne &amp; derfely he lokes, Rysys him vp renysch &amp; re?t i? his sete, “Quat faris þou with,” quod he, “frynde? a fo? þe besemes; Quy voydis þou my vessell? it is a vile schame.” “Sire, it is þe custum,” quod þe kni?t “in oure kyngis fest, Þat, be it ane, be it oþire þat þai of drinke, Þe gestis sall haue þe goblettis &amp; þaim gud þinke, To wild &amp; wende with a-way &amp; wirke quat þaim likes; Bot sen þis vse is here vn-honourable here I þa? leue;” Braidis þaim furth withouten bade þe butlers þaim yeldis. “Now sothely,” quod þa? ilk a segge softly to-gedire, “Þis maner at he melis of is menskefull &amp; noble.” Þan was þare ane proude pere a prince at þe table, Anepo, þat o? Alexander all-way be-haldis, Þan mynes him anes in Messedone he had þe man sene, Quen he was sent to his syre to feche þaire trouage. His vertuse &amp; his vysage his voise he remenbris, His fourme &amp; his fetoure his figoure a-vysis, He studis &amp; he stuynes he stemes with-in, “Is þis no?t Philip so? þe firs þe fedare of grece?” With þat he sle?ly vp so?t &amp; his sete leuys, Dro?e hi? euy? to ser Dary þare he o? dese bydis, Said, “surely, ser, þis sandisman þat sittis ?ow be-forne Is Alexander him awen self or all my? ame faillis.” Sone þis gouernour of grece is of þis gaude ware, He torkans with &amp; vndire-tuke he touched of him-selfe, Herd a nyngkiling of his name &amp; naytis him to ryse, Buskis him vp at a braide &amp; fra þe burde rysys. He tas a torche fra a tulke þat by þe table standis, Felly fangis it in his fist &amp; to his fole wyndis, Fyndis him faire him before þare he him feste hade, Ra?t him radly þe reyne &amp; o? his rige worthis. With þat he brochis his blonke þat þe blode fames, Sparis out spacly as sparke out of gledes. Be þe li?t at he led laches he þe way, And fandis fast to þe fli?t with a fers will. Þe pepill of þe palais quen þai his passe sa?e, Rusches vp in a res rynnes in-to chambres, Sum araies þaim i? ringis &amp; sum i? row brenys, Some in stalwart stuffe &amp; some in stele plates With hard hattis on þaire hedis hied to þaire horsis, Prekis eftir þe prince prestly enarmed. Bot now was ni?t o? þa? ne?ed þat noyd þaim sare. Sone ware þai willid fra þe way þe wod was so thike, Sum o? bu?es &amp; o? brerys blemysched þe face, Sum ware dreuy? doun in dikis sum in depe myrys; Bot Alexander at my? ame þaire a?e is a-schapid, Ay trottis him to þe trod-gate as him þe torche wyssis. Sire Dary as a drery ma? duellis at hame, With princes i? his palais all pense he sittis, Þe baldnes of þis baratour he besyly remembris, Þat skapid so sone skatheles fra all his schathill dukis. Þa? was a? ymage within as I am enfourmede, Of Sexeres þat sum-quyle þat cite had to welde, Forgid all of fyne gold &amp; fettild his seete Vndire þe souerayne sege þare sett ere þe lawis. And sodanly þat semylacre as tellis þe textis, It all to-paschis in-to peces &amp; to poudire dryuys. Þan was þe wale kyng waa &amp; wepand he said: “Þis be-takens trombling of my tild &amp; tene of my regne.” And Alexander all þat quile asperly rydis To þe grete flode of Granto? &amp; it o? a glace fyndis. Or he was so?t to þe side ?it sondird þe qweryns, His hors it hunyschist for euire &amp; he with hard schapid. Þa? aires he with Emynelows euen to his princes, And derfly o? þe toþir day a douth he assembles, Twa hundreth thousand o? a thro? all of threuen kni?tis, Cairis him vp to a cliffe &amp; comfurthis his hostis; “Sall neuir þe Persyns pake be pere to þe grekis, And if þai ma ware be many mayes no?t ?our hertis; Full many flees may fell bot a fewe waspis.” And all þe company clene comendid his wittis. Terciusdecimus passus Alexandri. Be þis ser Dary was di?t whit his dere erles, Heuyd vp a huge ost &amp; hast him to ryde, His ginge &amp; all his garysons in glyssynand wedis, Gaes him o? to granto? &amp; graithes þare his tentis. His stoure was so stalworthe &amp; store &amp; strange to a-byde, He had of me? out of mynde many may? hundreth, Þat sike a si?t &amp; a sowme of seggis enarmed Was neuer sene, I suppose se? þe sege of troy. Þe chiftayne had chariotis chosen for þe nanes, Ten thousand be tale tried for þe were. And þai ware sett aþire side full of sythe-bladis, Kene keruand as knyfes &amp; cursers þam drowe. Þe next day be þe none new note ryses, Aithire freke with his folke in þe fild metis, And bald bernes o? bent banars vnfaldis, Put pennons o? pollis payntid of siluir. Alexander as belyue is armed vp clene, Bounes him to his blonke þe best vndire heuen, Þat was þe blonk Bucifal as þe buke tellis, A foole worth fyfty of þe firste þat in þe flode drouned. He spynnes him out a grete space fra he[s] peris all, Couers him full clenly &amp; closed i? his gere. Þe powere out of Persy que? þay þe prince sa?e, Frayed was of his fourme so ferdfull him semed. Now ere þe batails boune with braggins in trumpis, Þe breme bemen blaste beres to þe welke?. Alexander allþire first o? þaim all he settis, And aithire ward at a wa?p wi?tly inIoynes. Archars &amp; all me? asperly fi?tis, Þare was Iusting o Ioy Iopons a-tamed; Siles doun o? aithire side selcuth kni?tis, Sum darid, sum dede sum depe wondid. So fell fli?t was of flanys as I fynd wrete?, Of arrows &amp; of all quat þat all þe aire blindid; Hogere o? to be-hald þa? of haile-stanes, And all þe fild full of folke fyue mile large. Als sone as þe so? vp so?t þe sla?tere begynnes, And so to þe so?-sett slakid þai neuire. Be þat þe barbryne blode be-ga? to discende, Þe proudest of þe Persyns past out of lyue. Sone as ser Dary it deuysid &amp; se?is his foke faile, With þat he bedis þam þe bake &amp; bidis na langir; Þen que? þai fange to ?e fli?t was furth in with euyn, And mirke out of mesure na man þaim a-pered. For-þi þe chariotis in þe chace choppid þaim to deth, Þe cartis þat I carpid of with þe kene sythis, Þare fell as fele þa? before of foteme? &amp; othire, As risonis in a ranke fild quen riders it spille?. Sire Dary dryue in þe derke &amp; his douth folows, Gaes him on to grantun vn-to þe grete burne, Fand it frosen him before as fell for þe time, Past him o? with his pers a pake out of nombre. His folke fellis all þe flode a forelange o brede, Þe streme fra þe a strande stre?t to þat othire. Sone fra him-self was at þe side it sonders behind, And all at lent ware on-loft loste þar þe swete. Þus many deed þat day as þe buke tellis, Of pollis out of Persye withouten þe grekis, Thre hundreth Mille thra me? þat tharned þaire lyues, With þe fooles &amp; þe folke þat þe flode drouned. Þis senioure out of Susys to his cite wendis, Fallis doun o? his face flat i? þe sale, “Wa is me!” quod he, “wriche wa is me vnhappy!” Si?is selcuthely sare &amp; sadly he wepys, “I þat was stra?t to þe sternes am streken now to grond, Now crato?, now caitefe now am I kast vndire, Þat had of the Orient all ouire homage vmqwile. Wist any we quat him suld worth þis werd wald he leue, Full sympill in a seteqwile seke to þe cloudes, And þai at mast ere of mi?t smyten all to poudire.” With þat reufully he rase &amp; renkis out he sendis, To Alexander belyue &amp; all slike a pistill. “I, drery kynge o? my dese Darius of Persy, To Alexander þat Aire þat all has to wild, Þe lege lord of my lyfe to lose or to saue, Þus send I to my souerayne salutis &amp; ioy. So wyde is þe wisdo? þat wonne[s] in ?our saule, Þat wele ?e wate, of all men at I worthid here before, Of all þe notis þat ere now &amp; quat o? next sewes. For-þi ?our werke ay be witt ?e wirke v?reproued.

Was no?t Sexes him-selfe þe souereynest in erth, And cheued him of cheualry chekis out of nombre? ?it for his will out of worde was wo? in-to pride, In þe lede here of Elanda lithirly he feyned. Þinke þat allanely of god þis ouirlaike þou haues, For-þi haue mercy o? þi me? þi meche we beseke, Als of ?oure grete gudnes to grant vs oure modire, Oure bride, oure barnes out of bande for besandis eno?e, For all þe feete at oure fadirs in þe fold hade, In Battri &amp; in þis bild þe bur?e of Elanda, Þe maistri &amp; þe maieste of Mede &amp; of Persy, With all þe Iolyte &amp; Ioy þat Iubiter vs lenes.” Þe seggis at fra Susses was sent with þe pistill Aires to ser Alexander onone hit him reches; And he dos o? before his ost openly to rede, And all his kni?tis for þe carpe ware kenely reioysed. Þe? was ane Permeo?, a pere a prince of his oste, Enclynes him doun to þe kyng said: “kid emperoure, Resayue þis risches, I rede þat ?ow þis renke bedis, And lyuers him his ladis &amp; all his lele childire.” Þa? Alexander belyue þa hathels he callis, Þe berne at bro?t him þe brefe said: “bowis to ?our lord, And say, me wondirs, I-wisse if he it wete wald, For any mede a-po? mold his meneyhe to lyuire? If he be falle? vndire fote &amp; his folke streyned, And vencust of oure violence quat vailis him his hestis? His person &amp; his prouynce he put it in my will, And ?eld him vndire my ?oke þa? ?erne I na mare. And if [he] grant him no?t de-grayd bot for þe gre threpis, Bid buske him eft to þe bent vs bataill to ?eld.” Þus monest he þe messangers þaire maistir to say, Geuys þa? giftis full gude &amp; lete þa? ga swyth. And þan comands he his kni?tis þe corses vp to gedire, Of all þe douth at was dede &amp; di?t þam in graues. And at wondid was, I-wis as þe writt tellis, To serche þaire saluys &amp; þar saris with surgens noble. At þe grete flode of Granto? now graythis he his tentis, Honoured þare his ald gods &amp; offirs þa? nouches; Þare fand he palais vp pi?t &amp; many proud hames, Sum-quile of Sexes ware sett þe sire of þo landis. Þa bildis he bedis þa? to brin sone of his bone rewis, And bad na bere? be sa bald a brand for to kyndill. Þare was a brade bent fild was beried full of kni?tis, Of ald peres out of Persy prince &amp; dukes. Þe Messedones in þe mold mynes to þe graues, Fand coupis all of clene gold &amp; costious stanes, Þe sepulture of a sire þat of Surre was kyng. Him was þe name Ninus was in a noke fonde?, Was of ane athill amatist &amp; all within graue?, Plantid full of palmetres &amp; many proud fowles, And slike a clerete it kest þu[r]?e kynd of it-selfe, Þai mi?t haue kend without þe kist þe corps all-to-gedire. Þare was a tenefull toure &amp; tulkis in-closid; Sum ware þe handis of hewe? &amp; sum wondid ho?es, Sum þe e?en, sum þe eres &amp; egirly cries On Alexander eftir hel? &amp; he þam all liuers. He wepis o? þa? for wa said, “wa is me, my childire!” And ilkane of his talentis he takis ten thousand. Þus ware þai di?t of ser Dary for he dedeyne hade, þat þai ware comen doun of kyngis &amp; be no cause ellis. Be now þe douth of ser Daris þe derfe messangere Fra Alexander agay? his answare him bro?t; And he þan girdis out to grete eft graythis him to fy?t, To þe honoryd here out of ynde þus ordans a pistill. “þat þe sceptoure &amp; þe soile sesid am of Persy, To Porrus vndire my present plesance &amp; ioy. First wrate I to ?our worthines ?it write I þe same, To help vs at þire hathill me? þat haue wald my regne, And, be ?e sure, þe same way is to ?our-self ettild. For he þat werrais vs with þe wildare of grece, Is wrawid &amp; wrathfull of will &amp; wode as a lyo?, As wawes of þe wild see whe? wynd þaim distrobles; And if I sande me? &amp; sammen seggis out of nombre, And cokke with þe conquirour till I be cald drepid, ?it me is better o? þe bent in bataile be slayne, Þan se þe lose of my ledis &amp; ay leue i? sorowe.

Þan ordans him þis honorable with his ost flitis, Agay? þe Persyns king him ordans to ride, For þe name of a?

First cald I ?ow my clyentis þat now I call lordis, Semes ?ow no?t it suffice my sorowe with-out, Þat as a bitand brand me brettens with-in, And slaa ?e me þus sudanly? þe se[n]ioure of grece, He will me wreke on ?oure werke wers þan of thefes!” Þar meuyd þaim na mercy bot maynly him woundid, Þat doun he hildis all to-hewyn þaire handis be-twene. Þan dryfes furthe þa dones men &amp; halfe dede him leuys, Famand out of fresch blod &amp; here a fitt end. Quartusdecimus passus Alexandri. Quen Alexander of þis athill þis auntir hadd herd, How he was di?t of his douth &amp; to þe dede woundid, He stre?t him to struma &amp; ouire þe streme ridis, So?t him in Sussys him-selfe with his ost. Þe pepill out of Persy quen þai oure prince see, Þan ?ode þai furthe &amp; vn-?arkid þe ?atis of þe cite, Resayues him full rially with reuerence &amp; ioy, Said: “welcum be þou, werraiour þat all þe erd loutis!” Sone as þir weried wi?tis was ware of hes come, Þat slo?e so þaire souerayne þat neuire sake hadd, Þai he?e þaim to holes &amp; hyrnes &amp; hydis þaim belyue, Þo?t, or þai wist of his will þai wald no?t apere. Þan gase he vp be degrece the grecen maistir, Passis in-to þe palais a paradyce semed, Was o? þe make of þat mote no?t mervalled a litill, Þat compast was of Cusys þat kynge was of Persy. Þe flore vndire þe fote fynely was paued, Couerd all of cristall &amp; oþire clere stanes. ?it ware þe wawes of þe wanes wro?t, as I rede, Polischid all of pure gold &amp; of plate werkis. And þat was streken full of sternys &amp; of sere gemmys, With bri?t blasynand bees as bemes of þe so?. Þe hathill hedis vp-o? he?e &amp; hogely he wondirs, Þat euire suld emperoure in erth slike ane herde wild. Quen he had ferlyd his fill apo? þat faire hame, Þur?e-out þe sale þan he so?t in-to þe selfe chambre, Þare quare þe lord in lay with laythely woundis, Girdid out as gutars in grete gill-stremes, ?it was þare lyfe in his like litill if it semed, At ilk blast of his breth þe blode fra him glidis, Sire Alexander him avysis &amp; authly him thinke; Þe pure pete of his pay? persid his hert. Þan nymes he fra his awyn neke a? emperoures mantill, And þat he couirs ouire þe kyng &amp; clappis him in armes, With gry? gretyng &amp; gro &amp; grysely terys; Bad: “comfurth þe, ser conquirour &amp; of þi care ryse, Don a?ayne þe dignite þe diademe of Pers, And all þe ri?tis of þi rewme resayue as before.

My dere so?,” quod Daryus “it drawes nere þe tyme; My banes, on my benyso? bery with þi hand, With þe proued princes out of Pers &amp; with þe proude grekis, And þe maistirlings of Messedoyne ?e me to mold bring. Lat þan oure kyng-domes a-corde &amp; cock we na langir, Bot ay perpetuall pes oure partys betwene. Vn-to ?oure mekill maieste my modire I comande, Rodogarus þe riall &amp; rewis on my bride; My do?tir Rosan þe riche resayues to ?our spouse, It comys wele of hi?e ky? kyngis to descend. Tak tent to þat at I tell be tendire of my kni?tis.” And with þis speke at he spake þe sprete he ?eldis. Þan was his body enbawmed &amp;, as he bede, graue?. Þis bald baratoure him bare &amp; as a barne gretis, So did þe pepill out of Persy bot for his pite mare Þan for þe dethe of Dary be dowble of þe twa. And Alexander belyue as he was enterid, He meues agay? to þe mote &amp; o? þe morne eftir, Vp to þe souerayne sege with Septour he wyndis, Þat Cusus þe conquirour of clere gold maked. Þe mody men of Messedone þe maistirs of Persy Þan put þa? in-to presens as þe prose tellis; Sire Darius awe? dyademe þai did o? his hede, A coro?, ane þe costious þat euire kyng weryd, On þe propurest of proiecte þat euire prince bere. Þe massy werke was þe menest made of þe noble, Þe pride þar-of for to proue it pyned any criste?; It gaue so glorius a gleme of gold &amp; of stanes, Þat as þe loge for þe li?t lemed as of heuen. Þe sete þare him-selfe satte in soyte with þe croune, Þat was lift a-po? loft o? oþire litill segis, Seuyn cubet of clere gold was countid þe hi?t. And vij degrece was þar grayd for gate vp of kingis, And þai ware Ientilly Ioyned in a Ioyly wyse. Þe first a? athil Amatast as I a? infourmed, And of a Smeth [s]maragadane Smyten was þe toþir; Þe thrid of a Topas a-tyred &amp; trelest &amp; grauen; Þe ferd degre a Granate a gracious gemme; Þe fyfte was of ane Adomant all-to-gedire makid; Þe sext of gletirand gold gayle was forgid; Þe ouirmast, all of þe erth with-out oþire werkis, Apo? þis wyse ware þai grayd &amp; for grete cause. Þe first was of a? Amatist þat all chaye demes Riche, said þe romance &amp; ronkenes of wynes, Lattis na dronkynnes þa? dere þat douth at it beris. Þe same wyse mo? a wee waite to him-selfe, A kni?t at couettis to cly? to kyngs astate, Him bus haue warnes him with of wit &amp; of mynde, Þat he wirke no?t o? þe wethire halfe for wathe apo? erth. Þe s[e]cunde was of Smaragdone þat ay þe si?t kepis; Quat berne as beris it him o? it bri?tens his e?e?. So bus a kyng to consaile haue a clere hert, To se at syttis him to se &amp; sagely to wirke. Þe thrid was a Topas, I trow at to þe trone lengis; Þat is so clere of his kind þe clause me recordis, Þat qua-sum-euire in þat ilk his ymage behaldis, Þe face is to þe fold-ward þe fete to þe firment. So comes it wele for a kyng to knaw till his end, How ay þe top to þe taa is turned at þe last. Que? fortune festis him he fendis beliue, And all his dignite bedene driues in-to poudire. Þe ferd was a granate, I gesse goules althire fynest; Is nane so redy, as I rede of all þe riche stanes; Slike color a?e a kyng wele in conyschance to bere, Þat he schape to na schauadry þat schend suld his fame. Þe fift was all of adomant as þe buke tellis; Þat is he þat is so hard þat hurt may nane tole; Is nothire stele ne na stane so stife it may perce, And growis out of þe grete see in graynes &amp; in cragis. If any Naue to it ne?e þat naylid is with iry?, Þe? cleuys it ay to þe clife carryg &amp; othyre; Bot blode of body, sais þe buke bees it neuire percid, Or þe natour of anothire thing þat nedis no?t to reke?. Þat same kynd suld a kyng of his craft vse, So stable &amp; so stedfast to stand in his werkes, Þat for na prayere ne pres ne plesaunce o? erthe, Out of þe rake of ri?twysnes re? suld he neuire. Þe Sext was of gold graciously hewe?, Of all metals o mold þe maistir &amp; þe syre; Þe same cure is a kyng be kind of his leggis, To gy &amp; gouerne his gomes þe grettest he is makid. Þe seuynt vp to þe sege was of þe selfe erth, Þat is na mare for to mene as me my mynd tellis, Bot ilka kyng suld him knaw cried of þe soile, And to þe same sustenance sodanly to worthe. Þus sett oure syre in his sete with septoure in hand, In pelour &amp; in pall &amp; proud me? him by. Þa? lete he lettres belyue with ledis out to send, Þur?e all þe prouynce of pers promicid þis werkis. “Þe kyng with-oute? compere of kyngis all othire, Of all þe lordis now þe lord þat lefis apo? erth, Sire Alexander, athill so? of Amo? his dri?te?, And als of Olimpades anyly consayued, To þe souerayns &amp; þe Senescalls þe sires &amp; þe maistris, And all þe pers out of persy princes &amp; dukis, Þe Iustis &amp; þe gentils &amp; Iugeme? of lawe, Bathe citi?ens &amp; seriant salutis of grace. Syn it lokid has þe largenes of þe lord of heuen, Þat me þis diademe of Dary demed is &amp; graunted, And to be here þus enhansid in his hi?e trone, ?e sall be glad of my degre &amp; gretly reioyd, And ordans aiquare ouire all honourable princes, Gouernours &amp; gardens of all þe grete bur?es, As was in Darius days to deme men þe ri?t, And clene all þe clientis to kepe þaire demayndes. Ilk a pepill his possessio? in pes mo?t he broweke, Armoure &amp; actons y latt all þat be kepid, Caires þa? to castells &amp; in kinge houses, And none so bald, ere I bide to bere þa? na mare. And fra þis marche to Messedone quils I am maistir here, Þe passage in aithire part sall play? be &amp; ope?, Þe comers out of aithire coste to caire vndistrobbed, With message &amp; Marchandise &amp; al manire of nedis.” Now is his pistils all past &amp; pese he comandis; “Quilke of my fryndis ere þe folke þat my faa slo?e, Þat was þe drepars of Dary now doo þam a-pere, Þat þai may weld for þis werke wirschip to mede. My mekill mi?tfull gods I may?ly ?ow swere, And o? þe lay at I leue &amp; be my lufed modire, Þe worthe wage þaim wayne þat þai haue wele serued.” Þa? all þe pepill out of Persy pouret out to wepe; Bathe Besa? &amp; Anabras as þe buke tellis, Þat ware þe banes of his body baldly þa? shawis; Said: “we to-hewid him [with] oure handis hi?e emperoure.” Þai wend wele þaim to wy? a waryso? for euire. Þa? bad he bernes þaim to bynd &amp; bringe þaim be-lyue Vn-to þe gudmans graue &amp; hewe of þaire hedis. “Allas, my lord,” quod þa ledis “&amp; ?e so late swore, To ?our worthi gods, ?our wale dame we suld no waa suffire!” “Siris, as ?e worthi ware, I-wisse I wate wele I hi?t, And bot ?our harmes were vnhid I held no?t myne athis. For sen I wa? in-to þe werld my witt has bene aye, Quen treid was a trechory þe tulkis to be hedid.” Þa? he did þaim to deth as dri?ten him praysed, Þe prouynce pi?t is in pes &amp; princes ere maked, An ald derling of Darius was duke made of pers, Request of þe rials ane of his riche vncles. Oure emperoure, quen þis was endid erly o? þe morne, With all þa alyens him by &amp; ancient lordis, He gase a-gayne to de-grece vp to þe gilt trone, Dobbed in his diademe &amp; di?t as be-fore; As Dary demed, or he deid his do?tir he comandes, Mad Rosa? þe riche radly to apere, Hire hede vn-helid was o? hi?e &amp; hild all in trissis, V?-by-clappid with a coronacle of costious stanes; As þe manere of þat marche was he wedd hire to wyfe, And in þe sege with him-selfe to sitt he hir makis, Comands hire as a conquyres of kny?tis to be louted, And all þe pepill out of Persy was passandly ioyed. Þai gone agraythe? vp þaire gods on gilten segis, Sayed: “þou ert duke of ilk dome &amp; dri?tin þi-selfe!” Þan was he fraid in his flesche bad, “feyne of ?our wordis!

Al be þe metire bot mene þus mekill haue I ioyned; Forthi, lordis, be ?our leue list ?ow to suffire. Now will I tary for a time &amp; tempire my wittis; And he þat sti?e to þe sternes sti?till vs i? heuen! Quintusdecimus passus Alexandri. Lordis, will ?e me lithe &amp; lestin a stonde, Now sall I kithe vs a carpe of a kyng riche, Of þe auntours of ser Alexander þat aire was of grece, How all þe werd at his will he wa? or he deid. Þe lattir ende of his lyfe me list ?ow to tell. For all þe first is in fittis &amp; folowand þe lettir, And he þat made ?ow þis mirth oft mynes his saule, Þat dri?ti? deyne him to dele a dele of his blis. Sone as ser Dary was deid &amp; done out of lyue, And Alexander as aire had all for to wild, Resayued to his riche quene Rosan his do?tir, And was þe croune be-kend of clene all þus ends, He gedird him a grete ost &amp; graythid him to ride, A powere of þe Persens &amp; of þe prowde grekis, Þe Messedones &amp; all men he [maynly] comandis On kyng Porrus to preke &amp; prese him with armes. Now gase he furthe with his ging þe gaynest in-to ynde. Þare many daies be dissert he dryfes with his ost, Be hi?e hillis &amp; howis &amp; be holu?e do?nes, Be wast &amp; be wildirnes &amp; be watirles bournes. Sone was he wery of þe way so was his wale kni?tis; Menyd þaim þe Messedones emang þaim-selfe, Þai said, it mi?t be sufficient þe sesyng of Persy, And him þat trouage o? tyme has tane of oure eldirs. “Quat suld we fonde any ferre now faylis oure strent[h]is; Þis erd of ynde is ilk dele enhabet with bestis, And he bet willis all þe werd be weris him to loute, His flesche is fostard &amp; fedd be fi?t &amp; by sternes. And were his perso? in pes bot for a pure tyme, Þan suld he faile as a freke at þe fode wantis. Bot lat vs leue him at longe &amp; lende to oure hames, And pas quedire as him plese with þe proud barbres.” Sone as oure kyng of his kni?tis þis carpe vndirestondis, He mas to stand all þe stoure &amp; standis vp in þe myddis, “Bald baratours on bent blythly me heris, All þe pepill out of Persy ere put in my will; All ware rebell in arest now is þe rewme ?old, And I your kyng as ?e knaw with croune &amp; with septour.

Eft quen we ferd in-to fild &amp; with oure faes mett, I was þe first ?ow before þat þe fild entrid, So?t in-to Sussys my-selfe for ?oure hele, In þe habet of Amon oure allirs dri?ten, Put my perso? in plegg &amp; perils a hundreth, And in-to tourment o?-tald me tuke for ?our sake.

Kni?tis callis him o? kneys said: “kid emperoure, All oure life &amp; oure lose is lent in ?our handis, Oure-selfe &amp; oure seruage is surely ?oure awe?, Ai at ?oure beding to be oure bodi &amp; oure gudis, Quare-euer ?e wend in all þe werd in watir or in erthe, Ay mekely at ?our mandment ?our maieste to folowe.

His tulkis of þis titill quen þai þe tenour herd, Þan ware þai sory of þa sawes &amp; selly frayed. “Quat now, my worthe werrayouris?” þe wale kyng sayd, “For Porrus pistill, I pray ne for his proud wordis, No for na manas he mas mayes no?t ?oure hertis. Did no?t ser Dary to vs write his pistill with pride, And all þe berbrens bernes in bestis þam affyed, As lebards, lesards, &amp; lenxis lions &amp; tigris?” With comfurth of his contenance his kny?tis he gladis, And þa? to Porrus apart þis pistill he writis. “I, þat þe kyng am of kyng[s] &amp; crouned of lordis, Þe eldist child of Amo? þat all has to wild, And honourd Olimpades with him ane gete?, To þe oddest aire out of ynde þis answare I make.

He feris him a faire flote was fed for þe nanes, Of vnicornes, of olyfauntis &amp; wondirfulle bestis, As ilkane vsyd with in ynde vmquile with to fi?te, And aires agayne Alexander with armes hi? to mete. Þe powere of sir Porrus was passandly many; A stour stiffe vndire stele þe strangest of þe werde Of sithid chariotis him sued a selcuth no?bre, At þe fewist, as I find a fouretene thousand; With-outen bachelers o? blonkis &amp; bowmen o? fote, Foure hundreth Olyfants in-fere folowid him enarmi[d], With ilkane bunden on his bake a borde? castell, And thretty tulkis in ilk toure tired i? platis. Oure mey-he out of Messedone quen þai so many sa?e, Þan ware þai storbet of þat stoure so was þe stythe Persyns. All þe athils of sir Alexander was ar?ed in þaire hertis To mache with sike a multitude of men &amp; of bestis. Þan was þir chiftans chosen cheualous kni?tis Þat buskid ware on bathe halfe þe bataill to rewle. With þat þai tuke vp þe trumpis be thretty at anes, A-grydis grymly to-gedir þe grekes &amp; barbres. Sire Alexander was armed &amp; askis his stede Þat was þe bald bocifalo? &amp; o? his bake worthes; Mare þan a stanecast at a count be-fore his kni?tis all He standis vp in his stereps in starand maylis. Þe men out of Medy he mas, &amp; of Pers, To envero? alle þe vaward of all þe vile yndes, And he was graythid [with] a ging of grekis kni?tis And maistres out [of] Messedone þis meyhe to helpe. Þe pepill out of Persye ware petusly woundid Of Olifauntis ouir all with horrible hurtis; All at vnweried a-way wynnes in þe stoundis Durst neuir his face to his faes eft o? fold bide. Sire Alexander him a-visis &amp; ames in his wittis How he mi?t bring it a-boute þire bestis to devoide; And mas to beete all of bras as bernes it ware, And full of glorand gledis þaim to þe gorge fillis; Ane instrument all of ire? þare ymage to bere, Was compast o? carte-wise &amp; cursoures þaim dre?e. Þire Olifantis of ynde quen þai þare-on waite, Þai wend þai ware wees &amp; wyndis þaim agay?

With þat þai fonge to þe fli?t be fifty at anes, Of ilka? athill ware þai a?ed þat any armes werid. Sone as ser Porrus of þe poynte &amp; o þe plite waytis, Þan was he tangid with tene &amp; turbled vnfaire. Þan preses in þe Persyns &amp; of þe proud Medis With arowis &amp; with othire armes agay? all þe yndis, Tolls of þe tirantis &amp; termynd o lyue, Se?es doun on aithire side a sowme out of nounbre, Thretti dais o? a thro? þai threpid euire elike, So lange at þe lest way as lastid þe bataill. Þare was þe Medis martird &amp; many of Perses Gorred &amp; gais þur?e &amp; grysely woundid. Oure mody kyng of Messedone þe myschefe be-haldis, Seis þaim faile so ethfully &amp; felly was greued. Apo? þe bald bucifelo? brant vp he sittis, Springis out a spere sperid all þe platis. Þe brest of þe bataill he baldly a-prochid, Girdis doun of þe grettis &amp; þe gree wynnys. His awen men of Messedone maynly þai fe?t, So did his gomes out [of] grece &amp; gate a grete name. Sone discendid þare doun þe du?tiest of ynde, And Porrus prekis fra þe place &amp; þe play? voidis, His ledis at left ware o lyue lendis him eftire. And Alexander in þat angle all þe ni?t logis, Offirs all his old gods his honour þa? thankis, As wele þe ynde as his awe? he graue þaim all. Sextus Decimus [passus] Alexandri. Þe secund day with a saute a cite he takis, Þe proddest ane at Porrus possessour was euire. He past in-to his palais &amp; in þe place findis Þat semed no synfull saule þe selcuthe to trowe. First fand he þare of fyne gold a foure hundreth postis, With crafti coronals &amp; clene coruen of þe same. Be-twene þe pelers was pi?t with precious leuys, Gilden wynes with grapis of gracious stanes. Sum were of cristall clere clustrid to-gedire; Sum made ware of Margarits þe mast of þe werd; Sum was smeth smaragdyns &amp; oþire small gemmes, And new nychometis nemellus endentid, Þat ware as semely que? þai ware samen, And all pargestis of plate as pure as þe noble. Þe Messedons in þa? merkid with þaire mekill brandis, And þe thinnest was a nynche thicke quen þai ware þur?e persed; And þo ware strenkild with stanes as sterne o þe heuy?, With charbokl[e]s o? þe champ &amp; with chefe perles. Smete? was smaragdans in-to þe smeth werkis, And athill amytists als in aungels licknes; Of Euor &amp; of Olifants was ordand þe ?atis, With barrers of ane Eby?-tree bonden with cheynes. Þe Eby?, as þe buke sais brin will neuir, And growis in þe Iles of ynde as Isodry tellis. Þe solers was of Sypirs all of a soyte makid; And Symolacres in þe sale was sett vp-o? trones All of glittirand gold as gomes it were, Discheualer with chaplets of changand hewes; And ilka tulke a tabernacle tildid was ouire, And þat was grauen all grayd of gilden platis, Flamband all in filour &amp; fewlis en-blanchid, Mekely merkid &amp; made of all manere of kyndis; And þa ware proudly depaynt þe pennes &amp; þe wingis, Of all colours to a-counte as þai ere cled here; Of fethirhame &amp; all fare as feetely enjoyned, As þai ware shapen o þe schell to schew to oure e?e?. Bet was all of brent gold þe billis &amp; þe chauyls, And, que? as Porrus co? plese in presens of lordis, Þai made as mery meledy &amp; musik þai sanng As in þe moneths of Mai or mydsomere euy?! Þare fand he vessale of value to vyse out of nombre, Gurds &amp; Goblets of gold althire-finest, Coupis all of cristall &amp; oþire clere gemmes; Þai fande bot a fewe dele forged of siluir. Þan rade he fra þa regions &amp; remewid his hostis; To þe ?atis of Caspy he come &amp; sett doun his tentis, A lande, as þe buke tellis a large &amp; a noble, All sauand bot serpentis &amp; oþire sere bestis. To þe mode qwene of Amazoyne þan makis him þis pistill. “I, þat þe kyng am of kyngs &amp; kiddist of lordis, Alexander, athil child of Amon oure dri?tin, To Calistride þe conquirese comfurth &amp; ioye! Oure weris &amp; oure wirschips &amp; of oure wale notis, How we haue done ser Dary &amp; drepid his kni?tis, Couerd all his kyngdoms &amp; conquirid his landis, I leue it to ?our ladyschip þis lange no?t vnknawe?.

Dame Calistride þe conquiris comes with hire ladis, Mas hire pes with oure prince &amp; pas to hire landis. Decimus septimus passus Alexandri. Þen come a sande to þis sire in þe same tyme, Þat kyng porrus þe proud with pers out of ynde Was in þe bonds of Batriane &amp; eft had assemblid Anoþire ost of odmen him eft o? to ride. As hastely as he it herd his ostis he flittis, And athils harnest o? hors a hundreth &amp; fyfti Was chosene to chiftans &amp; all of chefe dukes, Ordand of oure emperoure his ostis to lede. Þus pas he furthe with his princes ser Porrus to mete, In August eftir Iuli as þe boke tellis. All ware þai swollen of þe swete &amp; sweltid o? þe so?; Sum in þaire harnais for hete was honest for euire. Þai went be waldis &amp; be wastis þar watirs ware nane, And armed bud þa? all bee for angwischis o bestis, As colwers &amp; for coltris &amp; crabbid snakis, And oþire warla?es wild þat in þe wod duelled. As ai stremand sternes stared all þaire wedis, Of gai glitirand gold glesenyd þaire schildis. Þai dro?e furth be dissert &amp; drinkles þai spill, Was nouthire waldis in þar walke ne watir to fynde. A kni?t þat zephall was callid fand in a cole schade A litill drysnyng of dewe was droppid fra þe heuen, Þat it was in a holo?e stane &amp; in his helme fillis, And bringis it to oure bald kyng to brigge with his hetis. Þan Alexander to þis athill all þus he spekis, “Þis solayne sope if I su? quethire sustene it may Þe menbris of þe Messedones &amp; of þe many Persens, Or I my-selfe sall be serued &amp; þai sitt with nyfils?” “Sire, ?e sall first be refreschid” faythly he sayd. “Quat? &amp; ?e perisch?” quod þe prince “&amp; pas out o lyue? Queþir euir me list þan to lefe with langour &amp; sorowe?” And hilds it doun out of þe helme befor his athils all. Þa? slike a comfurth þam enclosed for his kynd wordis, As all þe watir of þe werd ware in þaire wambs hellid. Þan ferd þai furth till a fflode &amp; findis all þe strandis Full of Redis, as I rede rughere þan thornes. His folke fell to it fast &amp; freschely þai drynke, Bot was na renke at to it ra? at euire rase eftire. It was so keruand &amp; kene! þan was his kni?tis stroubid Mare for þe bale of þaire bestis &amp; brist of þaim-selfe. For with his florantis olifants him folowed a thousand, Of sithid chariotis &amp; soo &amp; sextene hundreth, With co?rres &amp; with clene floure camels and mules, And out of nounbre of nowte at nedid to his ostis, Thre C Mille in thede of thra me? of armes. Be now þai ware so ne?e tane þat þai for nede supposid, Sum of his awe? vry? &amp; sum o? Ire? lickid, Þat it was sorowe any segge þe si?t to be-hald! Þan aires him on ser Alexander with angwischis &amp; payne, Ay folo?e furth by þe flumme at I first tald, And at þe a?tand houre I ame, of þe day, Þan comes þaim to a castell was closid in þe borne. It was a mervalous mote made all of redis, And foure forlange, I finde þe flode was o brede. A fewe within þe forslet of folke þare a-perid, Waiteand out at wyndows to wondire on his ostis. Sire Alexander bad his men aske þaim of ynde, And frayne quare þai find mi?t any fresch watir; And þai þa? hent in þaire hedis &amp; hidd þam belyue. And he felly with flane flingis at þe wallis, ?it for na spell at he spirid spek wald þai neuire. And þan comandis he his kni?t[is] kenely to swymme, And þai all bare, saue þe breke with brandis i? hand, Þan thringis in on a throw thretty &amp; seuyn. Als fast as þai þe forthing-dole had of þe flode past, Þan girds þare vp fra þe ground &amp; grymly þaim woundis Of Seeles &amp; of see-Bules a swyth grete nounbre, Dro?e þa? doun in-to þe depe &amp; drouned þa? for euire. Þa? ?ede he þine with his erles &amp; egirly him thristis; Lebards lendis þaim agaynes leons &amp; beres; Dragons &amp; dromondaris &amp; of þir derfe Tigirs Fra morne to þe mirke ni?t þaim maynly assailed. Þus ra?t he fra þis reuir be many ru?e waies To it was meten to þe mere to myd-ouir-vndorne. Þan come he streke o? a staunke þe store me tellis, Was neuir na hony in na hyue vndire heuen swettir. A foure furelange or fyue it was of full brede, Umby-thorned with a thike wod thre mile a-boute, Was all of þe Rede ryse as I redd first; And þat he cuttis doun clene &amp; kindils in fyris. He gert tild vp his tentis be þat terne syde, Þo?t þare a longe quile to lie &amp; lachen his esee. Þe mone ouir þe montayns meryly it schynes Or he mi?t drinke any drope &amp; þen his dole ne?es. Þan comes þare-out creuesses of manykins hewis, Scorpions þaim to scere &amp; scalid neddirs, And þai so large &amp; so laith &amp; so lowd schrikis, Þat all þe soile of þa sidis of þe sound ryngis. Dragons dryfes doun o dri?t fra þe derfe hillis, With kene carefull crie and crestis on þaire hedis, Grisely gapand &amp; gri? with gilden brestis, And flawmes feruent as fyre flo?e fra þaire e?en; Þai drewe toward oure douth with dedly blastis. Sir Alexander &amp; his ost was ar?ed vnfaire, Was þare na freke in þe fild þat faithly he leued To be deuowrid &amp; devoidid &amp; vencuste for euire. Þe kyng þan comfurthid his kni?tis all if he care þoled: “Mi bald baratours,” he bad “a-baste no?t ?oure hertis; Seis ensampill at my-selfe &amp; seke ?e na ferre, Bot hedis haly to my hand &amp; harmes þar-eftire.” A brand &amp; a bri?t schild bremely he hentis, Fe?tis freschely &amp; fast with þa fell bestis, Dasches dragons doun geuys þaim depe woundis, Slaes of þa serpentis many sadd hundreth. Þan bildid of his bachelers &amp; braidis to þaire wape?; If þai ware mased &amp; amayd maynely þaim fe?t. ?it was þar twenti þat time tangid to dede, And þat þe comliest kni?tis at þe kyng ledis; Of athill archars als as þe buke tellis, A-boute a thretty in þat thede tharned þaire lyfes. Þus many deid of his douth as þe boke tellis, And him limpis all þe loose be þe lattire end. Now comes a company of Crabbe-fische as calues gret, Meuand of þis marras oure men to assaill, With backis, as þe buke sais biggir &amp; hardere Þan ony comon cogill-stane or cocatryse scales. Que? kni?tis of oure conquirours kest at þam lances, Was nane so wele-stelid poynt at þa? perse mi?te. Bot gomes with þaire greues in twa in þe gledis spurned, And all at left ware o lyue in-to þe lo?e entirs. Be þai had fyneschid þis fi?t was ferre in with euy?, Foure houres full farne &amp; þe fifte neghes. And leons quyte as lylly lent þa? agay?, Of bodis biggire þan bules berand vnfaire. Oure kni?tis at þe first come clenly þaim slo?e, Alto-bretind þaim o? bent &amp; bro?t þaim o? fli?t. Wild berys in þe wast fra þe wodd comes, With ilka tenefull tothe as tyndis of harowis, A cubete lenth, sais þe clause cald was þe lest. Þai seke out be sundres sexti to-gedire, With wild me? of þe wast &amp; women e-bland, With sex handis, &amp; soo sett out of kynd. Þai held in hettirly &amp; hurtis of his kni?tis; And þai with brandis &amp; bowis bremely þaim woundis, Slo?e of þa sauagyus a sowme out of nombre, And many scopid into þe scoghe without scath mare. Sire Alexander &amp; his ost angwisch enduris, Was waik, as na wondre was &amp; wery for-fo?te?. And þam he bedis at a braide to beet vp þe stank, With-out his ost ouir all horrible fires. Þan come a beste of a busche with a blak heued, Mad &amp; merkid as a Meere þe mast of þe werd, Fere fersere þan an olifant as we find writte?, Stayrand on to þe staunke þe stour to asaill. Þis breme best bare as þe buke tellis, Before forne in þe fronte thre fell tyndis, Hedous horns &amp; hoge &amp; hi?t in þaire tonge Adanttrocay with all me? as I am enfourmed. Before scho drank of þis dam his douth sho assaild, And oure kyng with his carpe his kni?tis he gladis. A?t &amp; tuenti me? of armes onone scho delyuird, Bernes was di?t þe deth with dintis enoghe. Þan mys out of þis marras as any may? foxes Come furth, &amp; fedd þaim in-fere of þe ded corses. All at was bitten of þa best was at a brunt dede, Bot ?it þai noyed bot a nykid to nane þat was ermed. Þan flo?e þar by þe firmament of þa foule Backes, Als store &amp; as stalword as þire sedill dowis With mekill ma?ten teeth as it of me? ware; And at vn-armed was þai asperly wondid, Of sum þai nyppid fra þe nebb þe nose be þe e?en, Of sum þai ete of þaire eris euen by þe rotis, Sum þai luggid of þe lippis þe lire fra þe chekis, Bot þar bitis, as þe buke sais blemest na kni?tis. Þan come a fli?tir in of fowls as fast as it dawid, To vise on as vowtres as vermeo? hewid, Þaire boukis &amp; þar bathire fete was of blak sable, And did bot plaid by þe pepill &amp; fed þaim on fyschis. Que? he had voidid þis vermy? &amp; vencust þat of ynde, Out of þis perlaous place he past with his ost In-to the boundis of Bactry þar bildid he his tentis. Þare reches was of redde gold &amp; many riche gemes; And clene all þat contre qwen þai his come wist, Þai mett him full manerly &amp; mekely resayued With presentes of pirre &amp; many proude giftes, And thretti dayis in þat thede he tholes &amp; abidis. A sertane folke was in þat soile þat Serres ere callid, And all þe lyndis in þat land with leves as wolle. And so þire Serres, at I said þaim in þe Somere gedirs, And makis þaim wedis þar-of to were for wintris blastis. Þire baratours bawers ere bremly reioyed Of þe conquest of þire cocatrices &amp; of þa kene bestis; And now he caire[s] fra þat kithe &amp; comes in a stounde Quare Porrus with his powere o? a play? lengis. Sire Alexander &amp; his ost caires þaim a-gayne With brade baners &amp; bri?t &amp; bragging of troumpis. Apon þe bald bocifalo? before his me? all He flingis out a forelange his feris to assaile. Þe Persens putt þaim in pres &amp; þe proude grekis; Þe Medis &amp; þe Messedons maynely þai fe?t, Þai swey doun as swiftly þa swart men of ynde, As euire did corne in a croft be-fore a kene sithe. Quen sir Porrus sa?e his princes in þe prese faile, Þan aires he out be-for his ost o? Alexander callis: “It comes,” he said, “to na kyng ne kidd emperoure To latt his pepill þus pas &amp; perisch in ydill; It fallis mare faire him þe fi?t to fynesch him-selfe. Forþi lat stedill all oure stoure &amp; stedd þa? esoundire, Þi semble o þe taa syde &amp; myne o? þe tothire; Lat vs twa termyn þe taite be-twene vs alane. If I be vencust in þe vaile &amp; voidid of my lyfe, Lat all my seggis &amp; soile be to þi-selfe ?olde?; And if þou failis in þe fild &amp; I þe floure wyn?, Latt þa? þine erlis &amp; þine erd myne empire obeyi.” Thus porrus in his hi?e pride to oure kyng spekis, For he was litill &amp; laghe him laythly dispices. For que? he wa? to wax þe writt me recordis, Thre cubettis fra þe croune doun his cors had a lenghte. Þe perso? of ser Porrus past him þat hi?t twyse, He feetis him forth in his force &amp; in his faire hi?te. Bot þe prowis &amp; þe prouidens &amp; of þe pure thewis Þat lurkis with-in þis lede full litill he kennes. Now is þe partise in pes &amp; þai þe place dele; Aithire kyng with his cause encontres o? othire. Sire Porrus with a proude swerd him o? þe pa? strikis So snelle at he snatirs with nere snaypid him for euire. Þan kastis vp a kene crie þe kni?tis out of ynde, For he was dased of þe dint &amp; half dede him semyd. Porrus, as a prince suld persayued þar latis, Turnes him toward his tulkis &amp; titely rehetis. Sire Alexander him avises &amp; his aande takis, As bald barratour &amp; breme his brand vp he liftis, With bathe his handis in-to þe brayne his basenet he cleuys, And he fallis doun fey &amp; fynes in þat stound. Þe pepill of ser Porrus quen þai [him] pas sa?e, With all manere of men maynly þai fi?t. “A! wriches!” quod þe wale kyng &amp; wisely he spekis, “Eftir þe deth of ?our duke quat deynes ?owe to stryue? Wete ?e wele,” quod þe wee “be werrayours la?es, Þat que? þe gouernoure is gane þa? is gomes wastid.” “Sire, it is better for to bate &amp; o? þe bent faile, Þan se þis rewthe o? ?our renkis &amp; reft be ?our gudis.” “Sirs, blynes of ?our bataile &amp; bowes to ?oure landis; ?oure fermes &amp; ?oure fraunches I frely ?ow grant; For ?e haue cockid for ?our kyng ?e sall no care suffire!” And þan callid him o? knese &amp; kest doun þaire armes. Þai come to þis conquirour comend him as dri?tin, Þan sett he sales vp of silke &amp; sacrifece makis. Sire Porrus, as him wele fell he proudely enteris, And all þe fey i? þe fild &amp; here a fitt ende. Decimus octauus passus Alexandri. Þan aires he furth with his erlis &amp; entris a? Ile, Quare þir Exidraces as Ermets inhabet in caues, A progenie of pore me? þat neuir pride hauntis, And ?it þe gentill genosophis þa? in þe gest callis. Is þare na bost þaim ebland ne bataills vsyd, Nouthire cites in to sytt cellis, nor na tounes, Bot crepis in-to creuesse &amp; craggis o? hillis, And ay is naked [as] a nedill as natour þa? schapis. Þe kyng of þat contre quen he þe come heres Of þis prince &amp; his parray þis pistill he him sendis. “We, corruptible creatours &amp; cald as be-fore, To þe mode ma? of Messedone all þus-gate I write. Sire, it is sayd to oure-selfe with sere mens tongis, How þou comes in-to oure kith-ward to cumbre vs with care, And þat Vs wondres, I-wis for wy? may ?e nouthire Nouthire gold ne na gude at euer gode fourmed.

If ?e will seke in-to oure soile &amp; sett vs agayne, Oure simpilnes &amp; oure sobirte forsake sall we neuire.” Quen he had lokid ouire þe lefe a lettre he in-dities, Þat he aproched all with pes &amp; in na plite ellis. Quen he was entrid þar erde &amp; sees þaim all nakid, And wo? as it ware wildirnes in wastis &amp; greues, Darke in dennes vndire dounes &amp; in derne holis, And bath þar bridis &amp; þar barnes with bestes o? þe fellis, Þan Alexander at þa? askis &amp; all him a-wondres: “Haue ?e na houses ne na hames ne holis in to bery?” And þar þai schewid him in schurrys to schellis &amp; to caues, Said, “here we ilka day duell deuyse how ?ow likis.” Quen he þaire simpilnes sees he soro?es in his hert, Pleynes of þaire pouerte &amp; profurs þaim full faire, “Quat euire ?e will in all þe werd or I wend, askis, And I sall gladly ?ow geue with a gud will.” “Sire, neuire to dee,” quod þai þa? “bot euire dure o lyue, Þat we desire ?ow bedene &amp; þan do vs na mare.” “Be dri?tin, sirs, I am a duke dedelike my-selfe, Forþi vnde[d]lynes to dele I dowe be na ways.” “Now se? it worthis,” quod þa wees “wriche, for to die, Quarto hi?is þou fra half to halfe &amp; all þis harme wirkis?” “Sire, be my croune,” quod þe kyng “þe cause at I haue Is purly gods prouidens predestayned it is before. ?e se, wele seldo? is þe see with him-selfe turbild Bot with þir walowand windis; my will ware to rifte, Bot a-noþir gast, &amp; no?t my gast þar-of my gast lettis;” And wendis a-way with þat word &amp; wemles þaim leuys. Þe secund day with vp so? he with his sowme ne?es, Quare þire Imagis ere þat Arculious had in a? Ile rerid. Þe tane was all athill gold of siluir þe tothire, Twelfe cubettis fra þe top? doun &amp; twa was þe brede. He made his pepill þaim to perse to proue þa? with-in, Quethire þai ware hologhe or hale &amp; hale he þa? fyndis, Sa?e þaim thike þur?e-out &amp; aithire thrill stoppis, And fillis þa? florentis a fyftene hundreth. Þa? drafe he þine with his dukis in a deyne entris, A wilso? wast &amp; wild &amp; wondirly colde, As mirke as any mydni?t que? þe mone failes, Þat vnnethes ken may a kni?t to se to his fere. Fifty days be desert he foundis with his folke, Till he come blesenand o? a brym was welland hate, And o? þe ferre halfe of þe bourne was wemen o? hors, Þat frely faire ware of face bot foule ware clethid. Sum beris all of brent gold brandis in þaire handis, Sum bataill-axes &amp; with bowes all of bri?t siluir, For brase is nane with þa bonds ne no bige Ire?; Ne neuire na berne þa? ebland as þe buke tellis. Þa? wald his pepill &amp; his princes haue past ouir þe bourne, And mi?t no?t for þe morsure &amp; maynyng of bestis, It was so borely &amp; brade &amp; bred full of ydres, Of dragons &amp; of othire deuyls &amp; doukand neddirs. Þan caires furth oure conquirour with his kid ostis, Lede þa? be þe left side of þe lande of ynde, Sone was he dreuy? with his dukis in-to a dryi meere, Was full of gladen &amp; of gale &amp; of grete redis. Þan sny?es þar, out of þat snyth hill as with a snayles pas, A burly best with a bake as bedell as a sa?e, Kene tethe as a knyfe a cowdrife breste, Of sembalaunce as a see-bule &amp; slo?e him twa kni?tis. Wald þar na brande in him bite ne no bigge launce, Bot alto-maukid hire with maces &amp; mellis of Ire?. A twenti dais ouire ten with torfare þai ride; To þe formast forest of ynde oure folke all aprochid. Euy? at þe flode of Eumare oure emperoure logis, And at þe xj houre I ame, as it ware, Of Olifants out of þe ways a? endles nounbre Come with a carefull crie oure kni?tis to assaill. A-po? þe bald Bucifalo? he bremely ascendis, Bedis of his swiers ga swyth &amp; swyne with þaim take. Þai ware a-baiste all belyue as þe buke tellis, Þat durst na berne o? þe bent a-bide bot him-selfe. “Be no?t a-baist, my bachelars” þe bald kyng sayd, “For with þe sweling of þe swyne we sall þaim all voide.” And so þai did al bedene &amp; sum oure douth slo?e, Tuke out þe tuskis &amp; þe tethe &amp; ternen of þe skinnes. Þat oþer dai be desert þa? destaned to ride, Be þe wild ynde woddis &amp; weme? þai faund With bare hedes as a barne &amp; berdis to þe pappis, And had na hattir þam to hele bot hidis of bestis. His seggis sesid of þam sum &amp; to him-selfe bro?t, And he þa? askid þa? of ynde &amp; at þa? enquires, Quat was þaire viaunce in þa vales “ser, venyso?,” þai said, “Slike as we haunt in þar holis with hunting in tymes.” Þen ferd þai furth all in fere &amp; to fild comys, Euy? to þe heued of Eumaure as I first rekend. Þare fand þai bernys &amp; bridis &amp; all bale-nakid, At was resild as a resch &amp; roghe as a bere. ?it was þe custo? of þar kinde as þe clause tellis, Als wele to bide in þe bourne as o? þe brade lande. Onone as þai o? Alexander &amp; o? his ost waites, Þai flee as fast in-to flode &amp; to þe founce plangid. Þan ferd þai furthe be þe frithis fiftene dais. And sa þai willid in-to a wod was full [of] wild bestis, Rynoceros, as I rede þe romance þam callis; And þai assembild o? oure seggis bot þai ware sone drepid. Þa? sexti days with his seggis he so?t be disert, Till he was wo? in-to a werd all of wast fildis, Quare nouthire holtis was ne hilles ne no hi?e [h]eggis, Bot all as planir &amp; as play? as a play? table. Eue? at þe elleuynt houre or euynsange tyme, Quen he had tild v? his tentis turbils þe welke?; Þe semblant sorowis of þe soile &amp; þe so? wadis, Þe werd wannes at a wa? &amp; þe wedire gloumes. Þan fell a fli?t &amp; a fire betwene þe foure wyndis, Aquiloun &amp; Affrike &amp; ewrus þe thrid, Vulturnus þe violent þat voidis doun þe leuys, Þe south &amp; of all sydis sadly þai mete, A breme blast o? þe bent as þe buke tellis, Þat all þaire tents it to-terid &amp; turned doun þe hallis; Þar pauylyo?s of pirre þaire payntid clathis It alto-schatird, &amp; to-scailed þa? in sondire. Þa? was kni?tis of þe case kenely affraid, And ilka segge be him-selfe said vn-to othire, “Þe writhe of þe wale god I wate, o? vs li?tis, For oure founding ouire his forbod so ferre to þe est.” Þan comforthis þaim þe conquirour &amp; carpis o? þis wyse, Bad, “baise ?ow no?t, my baratours ne batis no?t ?our hertis, It is na greme of oure gode ne grefe at vs fallis, Bot þe entring of þe equinox it euire elike-dele kyndils.” Sone as þe wedire wex wele &amp; þe wynde pesid, As, be þe bale neuir so breme it blynnes at þe last, Þan ferd þai forth fra fild to fild &amp; freschly assemblis All at was sperpolid on þe spene &amp; spilt with þe blastis. Þan fandis he furth, as I fynd fyue &amp; twenti days, Come to a velans vale þare was a vile cheele, Quare flaggis of þe fell snawe fell fra þe heuen, Þat was a-brade, sais þe buke as battis ere of woll. Þan bett he many bri?t fire &amp; lest it blin nold, And made his folk with þaire feete as flores it to trede; Þe hete was þa? a hoge helpe &amp; hettirly it voidis, And ?it was perischist, or he past a part of his kni?tis. Þa? vmby-clappis þaim a cloude &amp; couirs all ouire, As any pynaund pik þe planetis it hidis, And þat so thestir &amp; so thik a thre dais eftir, Þai sa?e na leme of þe lyft ne li?t of þe so?. Þan fell þar fra þe firmament as it ware fell sparkis, Ropand doun o rede fire þa? any ray? thikire; Þaire cabons &amp; þar couertours it kindils o? a lowe, And all þar pauillions of pall it to poudire wastis. It tinds on tend lowe trappour of stede, And many costious costis consumes in-to askis, Bages &amp; baners it blemyschid &amp; swellis, And quare it ne?es o? þe nakid it noyis for euire. Þan knelis doun oure conquirour &amp; callis o? his dri?tins, Giffe þa? siluir &amp; so &amp; sens at þaim castis. Vnneth his prayer was past quen purid all þe cloudis, And stint was all þe stikill stormes in a stand-quile. Þen rade he in aray remowis his ostis, To þe grete flode of Gangem &amp; graythid þar his tents. His bernes blischis ouir þe bourne &amp; o? þe banke sa?e Quare thre wees in a wraa welk þaim allane. Sire Alexander bad a? athil aske þe? of ynde, Quase þai ware, quethin þai were &amp; of quat kind. And þai him swiftly swarid with a swete steuy?, “We ere bald Bragmenys þat neuir bale tho?t.” Þan list þe lord o? his lyfe haue with þat ledis spoken, Mi?t he haue wo? ouir þe watir for wounding of bestis, As see-bule &amp; serpentis &amp; soukand locerhes, Bathe eddirs &amp; ascres &amp; atterand wormes.

For marcure was mansla?t a mammlere of wordis, ?e graith him to be gouenoure &amp; god of þe tonge. And Arcules has aythire arme in his awen warde, For þe xij wondirfull werkis he wro?t with his handis.

And Ercules as emperoure emyddis all he standis; And for he preuyd ay þe prise i? prowis of armes, He has a hatt o? his hede hi?tild o floures, Of palme &amp; of peruyk &amp; othire proud blossoms.

Sire, we erd no?t in elementis as euirmare to duell, Bot as qua pas a pilgrymage fra Parysch to rome; To othire hames vs hi?e quen we ere hethen voided, And in þe cites of sy? þa? sitt we na langire. Vse we nane Epocrise ne ire, ne no theftis, Ne nothire gesse we vs gods ne gry? at oure dri?ti?. For many seerties we seet þat sysed all þe werde, And wro?t þe will of ilk we to wale as him likid. And he þat wayues ay þe werst &amp; wirkis þe bettir, Þat gome is gods gud frend &amp; god neuire þe hildire. And þis similitude þat oure sede þou settis my pistill, Þe same ensampill, as me semes in-to ?oure-self touches, For so þe qwele of qwistounes ?oure qualite encreses, Þat noþir gesse ?e gouernour no god bot ?our-selfe! ?e brixsill our benignite oure bonerte repreues, And beris a-po? vs blasfeme þat neuire bale tho?t.

Vicesimus secundus passus Alexandri. Now gase he fra ganga? and all his ging eftir, Fondis forth with his folke &amp; a fild entris, Vmfaldin with a faire wod florischt out ouire Of Appils &amp; almands &amp; all manere of frutis. All þe chiere of þe champe was chargid with floures, Acrea, sais oure autour þat angill is hatte?. ?it wont me? in þa woddis as þe buke tellis, Of Ioynttours as Ieants in Iopons of hidis, And þai ware fedd all of frute &amp; of na fode ellis, Of grapis &amp; of gernets &amp; othire gude spices, Of sike as growis i? þe grewis I tald of before. Þai ware as rughe as a resche þe bake &amp; þe sidis; Quen þai persayued of oure prince &amp; slik a pake Armed, Þan stode þai glorand on his gome with grisely mawis. And he mas heraud &amp; heres to hant for þe nanes, And sett vp a schar? schoute at all þe schaw ryngis. And þai for skere of þe skrike in-to þe schaw fledd, For þai hadd herd neuire of how ne of mans noyse; And sex hundreth was slane &amp; sesid with oure kni?tis, And foure and threti, as I flode was in þe fild drepid, And iiij score o? þis side &amp; seuen at was armed Was with þe churles in þe chace choppid to deth. Þus thre daies in þat thede thurgh-out þai lengid, And dietis þa? with damysens &amp; oþir dere frute. Þa? ferd he furth to a flumme &amp; sett þare his tentis, And newly eftir þe none or nere þare-aboute, Þare coms a bonde of a brenke &amp; breed þaim vnfaire; A burly best &amp; a bigg was as a ma? shape?, Vmquile he groned as a galt with grysely latis, Vmquile he noys as a nowte as a nox que? he lawes, ?armand &amp; ?erand a ?ote? him semed; And was as bristils as a bare all þe body ouire; Do? as a dore-nayle &amp; defe was he bathe, With laith leggis &amp; lange &amp; twa laue eres; A heuy hede &amp; a hoge as it a hors ware, And large was his odd lome þe lenthe of a ?erde. With þat comands oure kyng his kni?tis him to take, And þai a-saillid him sone bot he na segge dredis, For nouthire fondis he to flee ne na fens made, Bot stude &amp; stared as a stott &amp; stirred he na forthire. Þan callis to him þe conquirour a comly mayde?, Bad hire be bro?t be-fore þe best &amp; bare to be nakid. And he be-held o? þat hend &amp; hissis as a neddire, He wald haue strangild hire stre?t ne had stiffe men bene; He wald haue schowid o? þat schene had no?t men halden, And to þe prince pauelio? prestly him lede. Que? he had ferlied his fill o? his foule schap?, He gers þaim bynde him at a braid &amp; brent him to poudire. Þen rade he fra þat reuir &amp; remowid his ost In-till a brade bent fild &amp; bildid vp his tentis. Þare fande he lindis o? þat lande þe lenthe of a spere, And þai ware frett full of frute þe fairest of þe werde. It ware to tere any tong to tell of þa trees kinde, For þai wald sett with þe so? &amp; with þe so? rise. Fra morewane to þe mydday merely þai spring, And þan discende þai doun as þe day passis. Lo, þis was a wondirfull werk bot gods awe? will, Þat þai suld wax soo &amp; wane within a wale time. For, fra it dro?e to þe derke ay till it dawid eftir, It was bot vacant &amp; voide as vanite it were. Þe kyng in his caba? with his kni?tis he ligis, Tutand out of his tents &amp; þe trees waitis. A bad a berne of a bobb bring him a nappill; Þa? bowis furth a bachelere his bedinge to fill; And he was sodanly sesid &amp; slane with a sprete. With þat enverrouns all þe vale a voice fra þe heuen, Said, “qua so fangis o þis frute bees fey in a stounde!” ?it bred þar briddis in þa braunches at blith was &amp; tame, And if a man had þaim hent or with his hand touchid, Þan flo?e þar flawmes out of fire before &amp; be-hind, And quare it li?t o? his like it lichid him for euire. Now bowis furth þis baratour &amp; bidis na langire, Vp at a ma?te mountane he myns with his ost, And viij daies be-dene þe dri?e was, &amp; mare, Or he mi?t couire to þe cop? fra þe caue vndire. Que? he was come? to þe crest his kni?tis wald haue esid; And namely a new note neghis o? hand, Of dragons &amp; of dromondaris &amp; of diuerse neddirs, Of liones &amp; of leopards &amp; othire laith bestis. Þare was hurling o? hi?e as it i? hell ware, Quat of wrestling of wormes &amp; wonding of kni?tis. As gotis out of guttars in golanand wedres, So voidis doun þe vemo? be vermyns schaftis. At oþir time of oure tulkis was tangid to dede, And slay? with þa serpents a sowme out of noimbre. So hard þai hampird oure heere &amp; herid oure erles, Vnneth it chansid þaim þe cheke þe cheffire to worthe. Quen he sckonfet &amp; skerrid all þa skathill fendis, Þen metis he doun of þe mounte in-to a mirk vale, A drere dale &amp; a depe a dy? &amp; a thestir. Mi?[t] þare na saule vndire so? see to a-nothire; Þai ware vmbe-thonrid in þat thede with slike a thike cloude, Þat þai mi?t fele it with þaire fiste as flabband webbis; With all þe bothom full of bournes bri?t as þe siluire, And bery-bobis o? þe braes brethand as mirre. Þus drafe þai furth in derknes a ne?en daies euen, So lang þaim lackis at þe last þe li?t of þe so?. Þa? come þai blesnand till a barme of a brent lawe, Ne?e throtild with þe thik aire &amp; thrange in þare andes. Þai labourde vp a-gay? þe lift a? elleuen dais, &amp; quen þai couert to þe crest þen clerid þe welky?; Þe schaftis of þe schire so? schirkind þe cloudis, And gods glorious gleme glent þam e-maunge. Þa? past þai doun fra þat pike in-to a play? launde, Quare all þe gronde was of gols &amp; growen full of Impis, A cubete lenth, sais þe clause cald was þe maste, Quare-of þe feloure &amp; þe frute as fygis it sawourd. Þare fand þai Revers, as I rede ricchest of þe werd, Þof it ware Ioly Iurda? or Iacobs well; Was neuir no mede ne no milke so mild vndire heuen, Ne cliffe of cristall so clere at euire god fourmed. A hundreth daies &amp; a halfe he held be þa playnes, Till he was comen till a cliffe at to þe cloudis semed, Þat was so staire &amp; so stepe þe store me tellis, Mi?t þar no wee bot with wyngis wi? to þe top?. ?it fand he cloue? þur?e þe clynt twa crasid gatis, Ane to þe noke of þe north a-nothire to þe est. Sire Alexander him a-vises &amp; all him a-wondres, And trowid it was wro?t of na lede werkis. With þat stairis he forth þe stye þat stre?t to þe est, And seue? dais with his me? he so?t be þa costis. And on þe a?tent day eftire þe prime, A Basilisk in a browe breis þaim v?-faire, A stra?till &amp; a stithe worme stinkand of elde, And is so bittir &amp; so breme &amp; bicchid in him-selfe, Þat with þe stinke &amp; þe strenth he stroyes no?t allane, Bot quat he settis on his si?t he slaes in a stonde. He vemons in þe vaward valiant kni?tis, Maistirs out of Messedone of Mede &amp; of Persee; Þai se?e doun sodanly slane of þaire blonkis, To ste? &amp; to stand-dede &amp; in þe strete liggis. With þat areris all þe route &amp; radly þai said, “Þe writh of þe wale god vs of þe wai lettis.” Þe kyng to knaw of þat case vp to þe cliffe wendis, Sa?e quare þe same serpent slepit in a roke. Þa? mas he bonds in a braide at sall na pepill pas, In bole &amp; in bala? buskes he his fotes, A blaso? as a berne-dure þat all þe body schildis, And fiches in a fyne glas o? þe fere side. Þe sc[h]rewe in þe schewere his schadow be-haldis, And so þe sla?tir of his si?t in-to him-selfe entris. Þa? cals oure kyng him his kni?tis &amp; comandis him to bry?, And þai as sone as þai him sa?e him for his sle?t thankis. Sone as þis balefull best was bro?t out o lyfe, Þan ridis furth oure riche kyng &amp; remowis his ost. And of þis way at he went sone worthis him a nende, So at he flitt may na ferre ne his folke nouthire. Þare was so hedous &amp; so hoge hillis þam befor?, Clo?es at was cloude he clynterand torres, Rochis &amp; rogh stanes rokkis vnfaire, Scutis to þe scharpe schew sckerres a hundreth. Þan ?aris he him ?apely &amp; a-?ayne turnes, And past in-to þe proud play? I proued to ?ow first, Þat all was brett-full of bowis &amp; blossoms so swete, Þat bawme ne braunche o aloes bettir was neuire. Fra þens oure note men be northe nymes þaim þe way, And þat þa? fonde all þe flote fiftene dayis. And þai croke ouire crosse to cache þaim anothire, Þat led þam to þe left hand &amp; þat a lange quile; And þus þai dryfe furth þe dri?t of daies foure score, Till at þai come till a cliffe as þe clause tellis, Ane egge þat was all ouire of Adamand stanes, With, hingand in þe rughe roches rede gold cheynes. Þan was þare graythed of degreces for gomes vp to wynde, Twa thousand be tale &amp; fyue trew hundrethe. And þai ware sett so in soute of safers fyne, Þat of þe noblay to neuen it neyd any criste?. Þare logis þe leue kyng late o? a? eue?, Vndire þis ma?te mountayne &amp; o? þe morne eftir, Þare setts he furth of sere gods a selle nounbre, Þat he honours &amp; his ost &amp; offirs ilk ane. Syne tas he with him titly his twelue tried prince[s], Gas him vp be degreces to þe grete lawe, Trenes to þe topward þat touched to þe cloudis, Þat he mi?t lend þar o-loft &amp; waite eftir wondirs. Vp-o? þe co? of þe cliffe a closure he fyndis, A palais, ane of þe precioussest &amp; proudest in erth, A bild, as þe buke sais with twa brade ?atis, And seuenty wyndows beside of serelepis werkes. Þe ?atis ware of ?ete? gold ?arkid of platis, Þe windows on þe selfe wyse as þe writ schews; And þai ware coruen full clene &amp; clustrid with gemmes, Sti?t staffull of stanes stagis &amp; othire. ?it was a mynstir on þe mounte of metall as þe nobill, Vmbe-gildid with a garde? of golde? vynes, Was chatrid full of chefe frute of charbocle stanes, With-outen mesure emaunge of margrite grete. Þis hame at houes on þis hill was in þe hi?e est, Forthi ?it hedirto it hat þe hous of the so?. It was so precious a place &amp; proudly a-tired, Þare was na place it a pere bot paradyse selfe. Vicesimus tertius passus Alexandri. Þen aires furth ser Alexander in-to þis athill temple, With Caulus &amp; with cleopas &amp; othire kidd princes, And fand a berne in a bedd bawnand alane, Ane of þe graciousest gomes þat euire god fourmed. All lemed of his letere þe loge as of heue?, For it was gayly begane with golde? webbis. A blewe bleaut o-bofe brad him al ouire, Was browde all with brent gold full of bri?t aungels. Þe testre trased full of trones with trimballand wingis; Þe silloure full of Seraphens &amp; othire sere halows, With curtyns all of clene silke &amp; coddis of þe same, With cumly knottis &amp; with koyntis &amp; knopis of perle. It ware to tere me to tell þe tirement to-gedire, Or a nany clerke þe cost to de-vise; And he þat ristis in þat rowme þe romance it tellis, Was ane of þe borliest bernes þat euire body hade, With fell face as þe fire &amp; ferly faire schape?, Balgh brade in þe brest &amp; on þe bely sklendire. His cheuelere as chauele for changing of eld, And as bla?t was his berd as any bri?t snaw. Sone as oure prince with his peris his perso? avyses, He gesse him wele to be god &amp; of na gome kind. He knelis doun with his kni?tis on þe cald erthe, With haile him hailsis o? he?e &amp; oþir hend wordis. Þe renke within þe redell þan raxsils his armes, Rymed him full renyschly &amp; rekind þir wordis: “Haile, Alexander!” quod þis athill “at all þe erth weldis, Þou ert welcum, I-wis &amp; all þi wale princes. Sire, þou sall see with þi si?t slike signes, or þou passe, As neuire segge vndire so? sa?e bot þine ane. And þou sall here apo? happis or þou hethen founde, Þat neuire hathill vndire heuen herd bot þi-selfe.” “A! A! happy haly here ma?” quod þis hathill þa?, “How þat þou neuynes my name &amp; þou me neuire kend?” “?is, sothly, ser,” saied þe segge “þi-selfe &amp; þi werkis, Or any drope of þi delume drechet had þe erd. List þe no?t loke on þe lindis þat leuys euire mare, Þat has þe surname of þe so? &amp; of þe mone alls; Þat is to mene, bot of þe mone &amp; mi?t has to speke, And tell þe trewly all þe text quat tide sall here-eftir?” “?is, by my croune,” quod þe kyng &amp; kyndly was ioyed, “Þis word I wald, be ?our will no?t all þe werd leuir!” “Ser, waite at þou be wemles for woma? touching, Þan may ?e leuely o? þa? loke &amp; lesten ?our wirdis. For be ?e pure of þat pli?t ?e may þis place entre, Þat is þe sette of þat sire þat sett all þe werd.” “Ser, I am clene of þat craft I knaw wele my-selfe, Be þou oure gide to þe greuys apo? gods name.” With þat bownes him þat berne &amp; fra his bed ryses, Cled all in clene gold kirtill &amp; mantill, A grym grisely gome with grete gray lokis; Al glitered þe ground for glori of his wedis. “Sirs, ?e þat will has to wend ?our wapens deuoidis, Nymes of ?our nethirgloue &amp; nakens ?oure leggis, Pesan, pancere, &amp; platis all to ?oure preue clathis, Iopo? &amp; iesserand &amp; radly me folows!” Þe kyng at his comaundment with his kni?tis him spoilis, Puttis of to þe selfe serke senture &amp; othire, Takis with him ser telomew a? of his princes, And Antiet, a? athill duke &amp; eftir him wendis. Þai ferd furth all in fere þir foure all to-gedire; Þe lede at was þar ladisman þe lord &amp; his kni?tis Went þur?e a wale wode was wondire of to tell, As it ware hi?tild in þat hill with handis of aungels. For þare ware tacchid vp trees þe triest of þe werd, A hundreth fote to þe hede þe hi?t was &amp; mare, Lyke oleues out of lebany &amp; lores so grene, With sichomures &amp; sipresses &amp; sedrisse e-blande. Þar trekild doun of þa teres of iemmes, Boyland out of þe barke bawme &amp; mirre, Of scence &amp; of othire salue as sechis out of wellis, Þat rase neuire of Aromitike sike rekils in erth. Þai fande a ferly faire tre quare-o? na frute groued, Was void of all hire verdure &amp; vacant of leues, A hundreth fote &amp; a halfe it had of le?t large, With-outen bark ouþir bast full of bare pirnes. Þar bade a brid o? a boghe a-bofe in þe top?, Was of a port of a paa with sike a proude crest, With bathe þe chekis &amp; þe chauyls as a chyki? brid, And all gilden was hire gorg with golden fethirs, All hire hames be-hind was hewid as a purpure. And all þe body &amp; þe brest &amp; o? þe bely vndire Was finely florischt &amp; faire with frekild pennys, Of gold graynes &amp; of goules full of gray mascles. Þan waitis o? hire þe wale kyng &amp; wondire him thinke, Was in þe figure of hire fourme no?t ferlid a littill. “Quat loke ?e?” quod þe ladisman “do lendis o? forthire, ?one is a fereles foule a Fenix we calle.” Þan bowe þa forthe all ebland &amp; to þire treis comes, Þe plants of þe proud so? &amp; of þe pale mone. “Behalds now,” quod þis hare ma? “to þir haly bowis, And quat þou will of þaim to wete wis in þi saghe. Appose þaim all in preuate bot make na play? wordis, And þou may swythe haue a sware at swike sall þe neuire. Þan may þou gesse in þi gast it is a gude sprete Þat sends þe sike asouerance &amp; sees to þi tho?tis.” Þire boles was, as þe boke sayes borly &amp; hi?e, Þe lind of þe li?t so? louely clethid, With feylour as of fine gold þat ferly faire lemes, Þat oþir loken ouire with leues as it ware li?t siluir. Þa? Alexander at þis athill askis a demande, “In quatkyn manir of lede sall me þir treis sware?” “Sothly, ser, þe so?-tree” said þe segge þa?, Entris in with yndoyes &amp; endis in greke; And mast-quat ay þe mone-tree þur?e mi?t of hire kynde, Quen it kithis vs any carpe þe contrarie spekis; For scho begynes all in grew &amp; endis in ynde, And þus be twinlepi tongis tell þai oure wirdis.” Þan knelis doun þe conquirour vn-to þe cald erthe, And aithire bole eftir bole blithly he kissis, And þo?t if he suld with þe thra of all þe thedes wete, If he suld move agay? to Messedo? quare his modire duellid. Þa? schogs hire þe so?-tree &amp; schoke hire schire leues, And with a swe?and swo?e þis sware scho him ?eldis: “Sire, þou ert lele of ilk lede þe lorde &amp; þe fadire; Bot þi sire soile in na side see sall þou neuire. For þi modire nor ?it Messedo? þou se?is þaim na mare.” Þa? list him lithe of his lyfe &amp; of his last ende: “So maideux,” quod þe mone-tree “þi meere bees na langir Bot out þis anlepi ?ere &amp; aftir viij monethis; Þa? sall he duale þe with a drinke at þou full dere traistis.” Þa? makis he mournyng &amp; mane &amp; in his mynd thinkis, Qua suld þat trecherous trayne of treso? him wirke. He said, “hende haly tree” &amp; halsid hire in armes, “Quat perso? sall do me depresse I pray þe me tell?” “Sire, sothely,” said þe so?-tree “if I þe sothe neuened, Qua suld þe wite out of þe werd &amp; þe þi werdis dele, Þan suld þou slaa þe same segge &amp; so my sawis faile; And þat may worthe be na wai for ay my wordis standis.” Þa? lokid o? him his ladisma? said, “lefe of þi wordis, For writhing of þir wale treeis &amp; willne þaim na mare. Bot graythe þe, gome, o? gods behalue and a-gay? turne, For ouire þe lemetis of þir lindis may no lede founde.” Þen bownes agay? þe bald kyng baldly he wepis, Þat he so skitly suld skifte &amp; fra his skars terme. So did his princes, sais þe prose for pete of him-selfe, With ?edire ?oskingis &amp; ?erre ?ett out to grete. Þa? bedis þaim þe barotour o? bathe þaire e?en twa, Þat þai suld neuire þis note to nane of his ost neuy?, Quat þai beheld in þe hill &amp; herd with þaire eres; And he þan styntis of his stoure &amp; steris his hert. “If ?e will gange,” quod þis gide “a-gay? to ?oure kni?tis, Moves ?ow to þe nethire-ward next I it hald.” Þan passis he to þis proud place &amp; oure kynge leues, And he gose doun be grece a-gay? to his tentis. Þar logis he fra þe late ni?t till efte þe li?t schewis, With sare sighingis &amp; sadd for sake of his wirdis; Costreynes him with his contenance to with his kni?tis play, Bot þat bot sprang of þe splene þe sprite was v?-esid. Sone as þe day-rawe rase he risis vp belyue, Riches him radly to ride &amp; remows his ost, Driues o? with his dukis day eftir othire, Till he was mete? to þe meere quare he þe monte entird, Þat was þe proud play? fild I proued ?ow be-fore, Quare all þe face of þe fild was of fyne goules. Þare pi?t he doun his pauylions &amp; with his princes bidis, And þe dri?t of a day he duellis in þa costis. Betwene þa styes in a stound þat strekis þur?e þe mountis He mas twa pylars doun to pynche all of play? marble, And tacchis vp of treid gold a pelare in þe myddis, With a prolouge in þat plate o? aithire post write?. “I, Alexander þe athill eftire þe date Of þe prince &amp; Persye &amp; Porrus þire pilars en-haunsid. Qua list þis lymit ouir-lende lene to þe left hand, For þe rake o? þe ri?t hand þat may na ma? passe.” Þis titill was of twa tongis tane out &amp; grauen, Of Ebru &amp; of yndoys &amp; of þire ald lettres, Of latine &amp; of othire lare &amp; leues out of grece, Proudly prikid all in prose; &amp; here a pas endis. Vicesimus quartus passus Alexandri. Now strekis he furth with his stour &amp; steris with his tentis, He leuys all þe march-gats I neuend ?ow before, And nymmes a-nothire o? þe north þe next to his kith, Þat to þe marche of Messedone was him mast qweme.

And þan scho laches him be-lyfe &amp; ledis him forthire, In-to a clochere with a kay þe clennest of þe werde, Was sammed all of sipris &amp; seder-tables. Vicesimus quintus passus Alexandri.

Quen þai ware sett þar in same? o? silkin webbis, Sone begynnes it to gaa &amp; gretly he wondres. “Ware slike a wondire in oure marche of Messedone,” he said, “It ware a daynte to deme for any duke oute!” Þa? answars him þis athill quene &amp; Alexander him callid, “Mekill grettir it ware to ?ow of grece &amp; to gomes here.” Þan stemes he with þe stoute kyng &amp; stiggis with his name; His chere out of chere hew it changis in-to pale, Þan has þat hende him by þe hand &amp; hent vp a la?tir.

Þe vertu of þe verray god envirounis him swythe, And þa? þai fell o? a fild as ferre fra his ost As any freke mi?t founde in fiftene daies, And he vnhurt with mikill vnhome he to his ost wynes. A-nothire wondirfull witt ?it worthid in his hert, How he mi?t seke doun sounde in-to þe see botho?, To see quat selcuthe is seet in þe salt watir, How many kind of creatours þat in þe cole duellis. Þan gert he gomes for to gang &amp; grayth him a ton? Of grene glitterand glas with gerrethis of ire?, Þat he mi?t sitt in him-selfe &amp; with his se?t persee Ane &amp; othire &amp; all þing at outwith it lengid. Sone was it blawen at a braide &amp; bro?t him be-forne, All boun as he badd &amp; bunden with cheynes. Þan of his bald bachelers þe biggist out callis, And ra?t to þaim þire rekenthis to rewle &amp; to hald. He makis a conand with his kni?tis &amp; kend þaim þe time, Howe lange him likid fra þe lande to leng in þe depe, In at a wicket he went &amp; wynly it speris; Princes pointid it with pik &amp; he þe plunge entres. Þare sa?e he figours of fischis &amp; fourmes diuerse, Þat kend he neuir so many kindis ne of so qwaynt hewis. Sum ferd all o? foure feete &amp; farand as bestis, Bot quen þai blischt o? þis berne þan bade þai na langir. And oþir sellis he sa?e at sai wald he neuir, Þat ware vnlikly to leue to any man wittis. Sone so þe setnes was gane þat him-selfe made, Þai dre?e him vp to þe drye &amp; he na dere sufird. Þan raikis he by þe reede see &amp; rides ay þe sannd, Ferly ferre with his folke &amp; ficchid his tentis, Þare fande he bestis o? þe bry? with bemes as sawis, Þat ware as bitand breme as bladis of swerdis. Þai sett in a sadd sowme &amp; sailid his kni?tis, Porris doun of his princes &amp; persys þar schildis, ?it fellid his folke of þaim fey foure score hundreth, And foure hundreth, &amp; ferre be fifti, þai drepid. Þan driues he þethin with his dukis in-to desert landis, Is ri?t betwene þe reede see &amp; Arrabie costis, A wilsom wast &amp; a wild &amp; wons full of neddirs, And þai ware hedously hoge &amp; horned as Tupis. Þai turred doun of his tulkis &amp; with þar tyndis slo?e; Bot þe dre?est deele of þaim died of his dukis handis. Þan past he to a-noþir place &amp; pi?t doun his tentis, And fand a bataill of bestis as breme as þe first. Þai ware of figour &amp; of fourme as fendis of hell, With heuy hedis &amp; hoge as horses it were. And þai ware tacchid full of tethe as tyndis ere of harows, And fell flammes as of fire flo?e fra þaire mouthes. A selly sowme of his seggis was slane or he wist, And he þa? hertis his here biddis, “hewis o?, my childire;” And ferly ferd of his folke was in þe fild strangild. Bot all þe dre?e of þa deuels þai drenchid or þai past. Þan fondis he furth with his folke in-to a fild entris, And þar he logis with his lordis &amp; lengis for a quile. For slike a fell infirmite was in his hors bunde?, Bucifalon þe bald stede þat he for bale dies. Þe berne blischis o? his blonke &amp; se?es his breth faile, Sighis selcuthly sare &amp; sadli he wepis, For he had standen him in stede in stouris full hard, Wo? him wirschip in were fra many wathe saued. Þe kynge to þis cario? he castis his e?en, Said, “fare wele, my faire foole þou failid me neuire! Sall now þi flesch here be frete? with fowlis &amp; with wormes, Þat has so do?tyly done? nay, dri?tin for-bede!” Þa? bilds he þare a berynes þis beste in-to ligg, Of schene schemerand gold as it a schrine ware, A tombe as a tabernacle &amp; tildis v? a cite In reuerence of þat riche stede &amp; eftir him it callis. Þan ridis he to a Reuere a ruyde &amp; a hoge, Detiraty þe depe þe me? þare it callis; Fyue thousand Olifants in feree þa frithme? him bro?t, A hundreth Mille heuy chargis ware hewe? for þe were. Þan pas he to a proude place a palas of ioye, Of Sexis, at sum time was senyour of Persy. Þar fand he garettis all of gold &amp; gildi? chaumbres, And many a miracle in þe mote þat miche ware to reken. Þar fand þai bridis in þa bilds borely &amp; quite, Of feþir fresch as any fame as ere þir fedill dowfis, Þat see wald of a sekema? or any sorow ailid, Queþir he suld warisch of þat waa or of þe werd turne. For if þai blithly vp blenkid &amp; blischt o? his face, Þa? suld he couir of his care men knew by þe takens; And if þai chaungid opo? chaunce his chere to be-hold, With-oute? doute he was dede þa? durid he na langir. Now bowis furth þis baratour &amp; Babiloy? he wynnys, Brettenes þe bald kyng &amp; bringis him of lyue, Ane Nabizanda was named &amp; a noble kni?t, Was ane þe proudest of his pirs &amp; prince of his ward. He lengis in lithis &amp; in lee to his lyues ende, A seuen monethis in sonde &amp; sende out a pistill To his modire in-to Messedone &amp; to his maistir als Of his auntours, of his angwisch &amp; of his athill werkis, And Aristotill be-lyue him anothire writis. “To þe kyng of kyngis,” quod þis clerke “comande I myselfe. Sire, quen I waitid o? ?our werkis I wex all affraid Sum grayne of godhede, I gesse was growen ?ow within; For þou has said þat neuir did segge ne sa?e bot þine ane; ?it mi?t neuir, I lofe oure lorde my lege, ?ow withstande; Sire, blissid be all þi bachelers at þe in bales helpid!” And now fynes here a fitt &amp; folows a-nothire. Vicesimus septimus passus Alexandri. Oure bold kyng in Babiloun nowe bildis vp a trone, Þe postis with all þe apurtynance as pure as þe noble, Þat was so wondirly wro?t of werkis diuerse, Þat slike a sege vndire so? was neuire sene eftir. So grete garisons of gold þe grekis in bro?t, Þe Medis &amp; þe Messedons many horsis chargid, Þat þai out of ynde &amp; els-quare with olifants lede; It wald haue wlated any wee þat welth to be-hald. Twelfe cubettis fra þe cald erth he castis it o? hi?t, And xij degreces all of gold for gate v? of lordis; And twyse sex Semylacris sesid he þar-vndire, Þat held o? hi?e with þaire handis all þir heuy werke. And þar was grauyn in þos gomes with grekin letteris, And titild in þe tried names of his twelfe princes. With ilk a statute þat þar stude stoutely enarmed, And euer-ilk a perso? a prince payntid was eftir. All þe sete of þe sege was smaragdyns fyne, Off tried topaces &amp; trewe tyrid was þe wawes, A tabernacte ouir þe trone tildid v? o? loft, And þan with stanes of ilka state wall þe stoure clustrid. A charbocle as a chasse was in þe chefe boll, Þat brynt in bely-blind ni?t as bri?t as þe so?, With Imagis vndire in ilka nend &amp; Impid in þe names Of all þe prouynces &amp; þe places þat he was prince ouire. And þai ware visid all in versis in variant lettirs, Sum in latens lare sum langage of grece, Assisid all of sex foote &amp; sett in betwene, Ay thre paire o? a plate qware a poynt ristis. Now sall I neuy? ?ow þe names note ?e þe wordis; Þe pepill out of Panthi is plant in first, Pruto, Picard, &amp; Pers &amp; Pamphalie bathe, Portingale &amp; Paiters it paies me trouage, Arrabe &amp; Artoyes and Assie þe mare, Abbeo? &amp; Aufrike &amp; Acres anothire, Effosy? &amp; Ethiops þire ebrues folke; All Ermony &amp; Ewrope enterely me serues, Ingland, Itaile, &amp; Yndee &amp; Ireland costis, Meede &amp; Mesopotayme &amp; Massedoyne eke; Turke, Tuscane, &amp; Troy and Tartary clene, Surre, Sysyll, &amp; Saarde &amp; Syres all ouire; Gyane, Garnad, &amp; Grece &amp; Gascoyne I haue, Baxe, Bayo?, &amp; Burdeux &amp; Bretay? þe graunt, Capidos, &amp; Calde þe Canony pepill, Russe, Romay? &amp; Ramys a rent þai vs ?eld.
