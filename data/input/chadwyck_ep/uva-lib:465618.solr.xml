      <field name="fulltext">A CANTO OF THE FAIRY QUEEN. Strenua nos exercet Inertia; Navibus atque Quadrigis petimus bene vivere; quod petis hic est. Horat. The ARGUMENT. Archimage tempts the Red-Cross Knight From Love of Fairy Land, With Show of Foreign Pleasures all, The which He doth withstand. I Wise was that Spartan Lawgiver of old, Who rais'd on Virtue's Base his well built State, Exiling from her Walls barbarick Gold With all the Mischiefs that upon it wait, Corruption, Luxury, and envious Hate, And the Distinctions proud of Rich and Poor, Which among Brethren kindle foul Debate, And teach Ambition, that to Fame would soar, To the false Lure of Wealth her stooping Wing to low'r. II Yet would Corruption soon have Entrance found, And all his boasted Schemes eftsoon decay'd, Had not he cast a powerful Circle round, Which to a distance the Arch Felon fray'd, And ineffectual his foul Engines made: This was, to weet, that politick Command, Which from vain Travel the young Spartan stay'd, Ne suffered him forsake his native Land, To learn deceitful Arts, and Science contraband. III Yet had that ancient World her Courts and Schools; Great Kings and Courtiers civil and refin'd; Great Rabbins, deeply read in Wisdom's Rules, And all the Arts, that cultivate the Mind, Embellish Life, and polish Human Kind. Such, Asia, Birth-place of proud Monarchy, Such, elder Ægypt, in thy Kingdoms shin'd, Mysterious Ægypt, the rank Nursery Of Superstitions fond, and learned Vanity. IV But what Accomplishments, what Arts polite, Did the young Spartan want his Deeds to grace, Whose manly Virtues, and heroick Spright, Check'd by no Thought impure, no Falshood base, With nat'ral Dignity might well out-face, The Glare of Manners false and mimick Pride. And wherefore should they range from Place to Place, Who to their Country's Love so firm were ty'd, All homely as she was, that for her oft they dy'd. V And Truth. sooth it is (with Reverence may ye hear, And Honour due to Passion so refin'd) The strong Affection, which true Patriots bear To their dear Country, zealous is and blind And fond, as is the Love of Woman-kind, So that they may not her Defects espy, Ne other Rival, or one to compare with her. Paragone may ever find, But gazing on her with an awful Eye, And superstitious Zeal, her learn to deify. VI And, like as is the Faith unsound, untrue Of Him, who wandring aye from Fair to Fair, Conceiveth from each Object Passion new, Or from his Heart quite drives the troublous Care, So with the Patriot-Lover doth it fare, Who through the World delighting aye to rove, His Country changeth with each Change of Air, Or weening the Delights of all to prove, On none, or all alike bestows his vagrant Love. VII Moreover, besides. Als doth Corruption in a distant Soil, With double Force Assault. assay the youthful Heart, Expos'd suspectless to the Traytor's Wile, Expos'd unwarn'd to Pleasure's poison'd Dart, Expos'd unpractis'd in the World's wide Mart, Where each one lyes, imposes, and betrays, Without a Friend due Counsel to impart, Without a Parent's Awe to rule his Ways, Without the Check of Shame, or Spur of Publick Praise. VIII Therefore. Forthy false Archimago, Traytor vile, Who burnt 'gainst Fairy Land with ceaseless Ire, Gan cast with Foreign Pleasures to beguile Her faithful Knight, and quench the heav'nly Fire That did his virtuous Bosom aye inspire With Zeal unfeigned for her Service true, And send him forth in Chivalrous Attire, Arm'd at all points Adventures to pursue, And wreak upon her Foes his vowed Vengeance due. IX So as he journeyed upon the Way, Him soon the sly Enchanter Overtook. over-hent, Clad like a Fairy Knight in Armour gay, With painted Shield, and Spear right forward bent, In knightly Fushion. guise and shew of Courage. Hardiment, That aye prepared was for bloody Fight. Wherat the Fairy. Elfin Knight with Speeches gent Him first saluted, who, well as he might Him fair salutes again, as Becometh. seemeth courteous Knight. X Then gan he Discourse or Argument. Purpose frame of valiant Deeds Atchiev'd by Foreign Knights of Might, Valour. Prowess great, And mighty Fame, which Emulation breeds In virtuous Breast, and kindleth Martial Heat; Of Arts and Sciences for Warriour Proper, Fit. meet, And Knight that would in Feats of Arms excell, Or Him, who Rather. liefer choosing calm Retreat, With Peace and gentle Virtue aye would dwell, Who have their Triumphs, like as hath Bellona fell. XI These, as he said, beseemed Knight to know, And all be they in Fairy-Lond ytaught, Where every Art and all fair Virtues grow, Yet various Climes with various Fruits are fraught, And such in one hath full Perfection Reach'd. raught, The which no Skill may in another rear. So gloz'd th'Enchaunter till he hath him brought To a huge Rock, that clomb so high in Air That from it he Hardly. uneath the murmuring Surge mote hear. XII Thence the falt Wave beyond in Prospect wide A spacious Plain the false Enchanter show'd, With goodly Castles deck'd on every side, And silver Streams, that down the Champain flow'd, And wash'd the Vineyards that beside them stood, And Groves of Myrtle; als the Lamp of Day His orient Beams display'd withouten Cloud, Which lightly on the glistening Waters play, And tinge the Castles, Woods, and Hills with purple Ray. XIII So fair a Landscape charm'd the wondring Knight; And eke the Breath of Morning fresh and sweet Inspir'd his jocund Spirit with Delight, And Ease of Heart for soft Persuasion meet. Then Him the Traytor base gan fair entreat, And from the Rock as downward they descend, Of that blest Lond his Praises gan repeat, 'Till he him moved hath with him to To go. wend, So to the billowy Shore their hasty March they bend. XIV There in a painted Bark all trim and gay, Whose Sails full glad embrac'd the wanton Wind, There sat a Stranger Man or Woman. Wight in quaint Array, That seem'd of various Garbs Together. attone combin'd, Of Europe, Africk, East and Western Inde. Als round about him many Creatures stood, Of several Nations and of diverse Kind, Apes, Serpents, Birds with human Speech endow'd, And Monsters of the Land, and Wonders of the Flood. XV He was to weet a mighty Traveller, Who Curiosity thereafter Was called. hight, And well he knew each Coast and Harbour fair, And every Nation's Latitude and Site, And how to steer the wandring Bark aright. So to him strait the false Enchaunter bore, And with him likewise brought the Red-cross Knight: Then fairly him besought to waft them o'er; Swift flew the dancing Bark, and reach'd the adverse Shore. XVI There when they landed were, them ran to greet A Bevy bright of Damsels gent and gay, Who with soft Smiles, and Salutation sweet, And courteous Violence would force them stay, And rest them in their Bow'r not far away; Their Bow'r, that most luxuriously was Adorned, set sorth. dight With all the Dainties of Air, Earth, and Sea, All that mote please the Taste, and charm the Sight, The Pleasure of the Board, and Charm of Beauty bright. XVII Als might he therein hear a mingled Sound Of Feast and Song and laughing Jollity, That in the Noise was all Distinction drown'd Of graver Sense, or Musick's Harmony, Yet were there some in that blithe Company That aptly could discourse of vertuous Lore, Of Manners; Wisdom and sound Policy; Yet Would not. nould they often ope their sacred Store, Ne might their Voice be heard mid Riot and Uproar. XVIII Thereto the Joys of Idleness and Love, And Luxury, that besots the noblest Mind, And Custom prevalent at distance drove, All Sense and Relish of a higher kind, Whereby the Soul to Virtue is refin'd. Instead whereof the Arts of Slavery Were taught, of Slavery perverse and blind, That vainly boasts her native Liberty, Yet wears the Chains of Pride, of Lust, and Gluttony. XIX Of which the Red-Cross Knight right well aware, Would in no wise agree with them to go, Albeit with courtly Glee their Leader fair, Called. Hight Politessa him did kindly woe. But all was false Pretence, and hollow Show, False as the Flow'rs, which to their Breasts they ty'd, Or those which seemed in their Cheeks to glow, For both were false, and not by Nature dy'd, False Rivals of the Spring, and Beauty's rosy Pride. XX Then from behind them straitway gan advaunce, An uncouth Stripling quaintly habited, As for some revel Mask, or antick Daunce, All chequer'd o'er with Yellow, Blue, and Red; Als in a Vizor black he shrouds his Head, The which he tossed to and fro amain, And Frequently. eft his lathy Falchion brandished, As if he meant fierce Battle to Attempt. darrain And like a wanton Ape eft skip'd he on the Plain, XXI And eft about him skip'd a gaudy Throng Of youthful Gallants frolick, trim and gay, Chanting in careless Notes their amourous Song, Match'd with like careless Gests, like amourous Play. Als were they gorgeous, drest in rich Array, And well accepted of that Female Train, Whose Hearts to Joy and Mirth devoted aye, Each proffer'd Love receive without Disdain, And part without Regret from each late-favour'd Swain. XXII And now they do accord in wanton Daunce To join their Hands upon the flow'ry Plain; The whiles with amourous Leer and Eyes askaunce Each Damsel fires with Love her glowing Swain; Till all-impatient of the tickling Pain, In sudden Laughter forth at once they break, And ending so their Daunce, each tender Twain To shady Bow'rs forthwith themselves betake, Deep hid in Myrtle Groves, beside a silver Lake. XXIII Thereat the Red-Cross Knight was much enmov'd, And gan his Heart with Indignation swell, To view in Forms so made to be belov'd, Ne Faith, ne Truth, ne heav'nly Virtue dwell; But Lust instead and Falshood, Child of Hell; And glutton Sloth, and Love of gay Attire: And sooth to say, them well could parallel Their lusty Lovers. Paramours in vain Desire; Well fitted to each Dame was every gallant Squire. XXIV Yet when their Sovereign calls them forth to Arms, Their Sovereign, whose Commands. Behests they most revere, Right wisely can they menage War's Alarms, And wield with Valour great the martial Spear, So that their Name is dreaded far and near. Oh! that for Liberty they so did fight! Then need not Fairy Land their Prowess fear, Ne give in Charge to her advent'rous Knight Their Friendship to beware, and Sense-deluding Sleight. XXV But not for Liberty they wagen War, But solely to Please. aggrate their mighty Lord, For whom their dearest Blood they Will not nillen spare, Whenso him listeth draw the conquering Sword; So is that Idol vain of them ador'd, Who ne with Might beyond his meanest Thrall Endued, ne with superiour Wisdom stor'd, Sees at his Feet prostrated Millions fall, And with religious Drad obey his princely Call. XXVI Thereto so high and stately was his Port, That all the petty Kings him sore envy'd, And would him imitate in any sort, With all the mimick Pageantry of Pride, And worship'd be like him and deify'd Of courtly Sycophants and Scoundrels. Caitives vile, Who to those Services themselves apply'd, And in that School of Servitude e'er while Had learn'd to bow and grin, and flatter and beguile. XXVII For to that Seminary of Fashions vain The Rich and Noble from all Parts repair, Where grown enamour'd of the gaudy Train, And courteous Haviour gent and debonair, They cast to imitate such Semblaunce fair; And deeming meanly of their Native Lond, Their own rough Virtues they disdain to wear, And back returning drest by Foreign Hond Ne other Matter care, ne other understond. XXVIII Wherefore th'Enchaunter vile, who fore was griev'd To see the Knight reject those Damsels gay, Wherewith he thought him sure to have deceiv'd, Was minded to that Court him to convey, And daze his Eyen with Majesty's bright Ray, So to a stately Castle he him brought, Which in the midst of a great Garden lay, And wisely was by cunning Craftsmen wrought, And with all Riches deck'd surpassing human Thought. XXIX There underneath a sumptuous Canopy, That with bright Ore and Diamonds glittered far, Sate the swoln Form of Royal Pride. Surquedry, And deem'd itself By all means, Omnine allgates some Creature rare, While its own haughty State it mote compare With the base Count'nance of the vassal Fry, That seem'd to have nor Eye, nor Tongue, nor Ear, Ne any Sense, ne any Faculty, That did not to his Throne owe servile Ministry. XXX Yet wist he not that half that Homage low Was at a Wizard's Shrine, in private pay'd, The which conducted all that goodly Show, And as he list th'Imperial Puppet play'd, By secret Springs and Wheels right wisely made, That he the subtle Wires mote not Discover, perceive. avize, But deem in sooth that all he did or said, From his own Motion and free Grace did rise, And that he justly highte immortal, great, and wise. XXXI And eke to each of that same gilded Train, That meekly round that Lordly Throne did stand, Was by that Wizard ty'd a Magick Chain, Whereby their Actions all he mote command, And rule with hidden Influence the Land. Yet to his Lord he outwardly did bend, And those same Magick Chains within his Hand Did seem to place, albeit by the End He held them fast, that none them from his Gripe mote rend. XXXII He was to weet an old and wrinkled Mage, Deep read in all the Arts of Policy, And from Experience grown so crafty sage That none his secret Counsels mote descry, Ne search the Mines of his deep Subtlety. Thereto fair Peace he lov'd and cherished; And Traffick did promote and Industry, Whereby the Vulgar were in Quiet fed, And the proud Lords in Ease and Plenty wallowed. XXXIII Thence all the gorgeous Splendor of the Court, Since. Sith the sole Business of the Rich and Great, Was to that hope-built Temple to resort, And round their earthly God in Glory wait, Who with their Pride to swell his Royal State, Did pour large Sums of Gold on every one, Brought him by Harpies fell him to aggrate, And torn from Peasants vile, beneath the Throne Who lay, deep sunk in Earth, and inwardly did groan. XXXIV Behold, says Archimage, the envied Height Of Human Grandeur to the Gods allied! Behold yon Sun of Power, whose glorious Light, O'er this rejoicing Land out-beaming wide, Calls up those Princely Flowers on every side: Which like the painted Daughters of the Plain, Ne toil, ne spin, ne stain their silken Pride With Care or Sorrow, sith withouten Pain, Them in eternal Joy those Heav'nly Beams maintain. XXXV Them morn and evening Joy eternal greets, And for them thousands and ten thousands Work hard. moil, Gathering from Land and Ocean honied Sweets For them, who in soft Indolence the while And slumbring Peace enjoy the luscious Spoil; And as they view around the careful Bees Quite spent. Forespent with Labour and incessant Toil, With the sweet Contrast learn themselves to please, And heighten by compare the Luxury of Ease. XXXVI Ungenerous Man, quoth then the Fairy Knight, That can rejoice to see another's Woe! And Thou, unworthy of that Glory bright, Wherewith the Gods have deck'd thy Princely Brow, That dost on Pride and Luxury bestow The hard-earn'd Fruits of Industry and Pain, And to the Dogs the Labourer's Morsel throw, Unmindful of the Hand, that sow'd the Grain, The poor earth-trodden Root of all thy Greatness vain. XXXVII Oh! foul Abuse of sacred Majesty, That boasteth her fair self from Heav'n ysprong! Where are the Marks of thy Divinity? Truth, Mercy, Justice steddy, bold and strong To aid the Meek, and curb oppressive Wrong? Where is the Care and Love of Publick Good, That to the People's Father doth belong? Where the Vice-gerent of that bounteous God, Who bids dispence to all, what he for all bestow'd? XXXVIII Dwelst Thou not rather, like the Prince of Hell, In Pandemonium foul of ugly Fiends? Dissimulation, Discord, Malice fell, Reckless Ambition, that right onward Goes. wends, Tho' his wild March o'erthrow both Fame and Friends, And Virtue and his Country? crooked Guile, Obliquely creeping to his treach'rous Ends, And Flattery, curst Assassin, who the while He holds the murd'rous Knife, can fawn, and kiss, and smile. XXXIX Then 'gan he strait unvail the Mirrour bright, The which fair Una in Spenser represents Truth. See 1st Book Fairy Queen. Una gave him heretofore, E'er he as yet, with Heathen, the usual Enemy of Knight Errants in Spenser. Paynim Foe to fight, For Foreign Land had left his native Shore. This in his careful Breast he always bore, And on it oft would cast his wary Eye; For it by Magick framed was of yore, So that no Falshood mote it well abye, But it was plainly seen, or fearfully did fly. XL This on that gay Assembly did he turn, And saw confounded quite the gawdy Scene, Saw the close Fire that inwardly did burn, And waste the throbbing Heart with secret Pain, Anguish. Teen; Saw base Dependance in the haughty Mien Of Lords, and Princes, saw the Magick Chain That each did wear, but deem'd he wore unseen, The whiles with Count'naunce glad he hid his Pain, And Homage did require from each poor lowly Swain. XLI And tho' to that old Mage they louted down, Yet did they dearly wish for his Decay: Als trembled He, and aye upon the Throne Of his great Lord his tottering Steps did stay, And oft behind him skulk'd for great Dismay: Als shook the Throne, whenso the Villain Crew, That underneath opprest and groveling lay, Impatient of the grievous Burthen grew, And loudly for Redress and Liberty did sue. XLII There mote he likewise see a ribbald Train Of Dancers, Broid'rers, Slaves of Luxury, Who cast o'er all those Lords and Ladies vain A Vail of Semblaunce fair, and richest Dye, That none their inward Baseness mote descry. But nought was hidden from that Mirrour bright, Which when false Archimago 'gan espy, He feared for himself, and warn'd the Knight From so detested Place to maken speedy Flight. XLIII So on he passed, 'till he comen hath To a small River, that full slow did glide, As it uneath mote find its watry Path, For Stones and Rubbish, that did choak its Tide, So lay the mouldring Piles on every side. Seem'd there a goodly City once had been, Albeit now fallen were her Royal Pride, Yet mote her auntient Greatness still be seen, Still from her Ruins prov'd the World's Imperial Queen. XLIV For the rich Spoil of all the Continents, The Boast of Art and Nature there was brought. Corinthian Brass, Ægyptian Monuments, With Hieroglyphick Sculptures all inwrought, And Parian Marbles, by Greek Artists taught To counterfeit the Forms of Heroes old, And set before the Eye of sober Thought Lycurgus, Homer, and Alcides bold. All these, and many moe that may not here be told. XLV There in the middest of a ruin'd Pile, That seem'd a Theatre of Circuit vast, Where Thousands might be seated, he e'erwhile Discovered hath an uncouth Trophy plac'd; Seem'd a huge Heap of Stones together cast In nice Disorder and wild Symmetry, Urns, broken Freezes, Statues half defac'd, And Cornices with antique Imagery Embost, and Pillars huge of costly Porphyry. XLVI Aloft on this strange Basis was Placed. ypight With Girlonds gay adorn'd a golden Chair, In which aye smiling with self-bred Delight, In careless Pride reclin'd a Lady fair, And to soft Musick lent her idle Ear; The which with Pleasure so did her enthrall, That for ought else she had but little Care, For Wealth, or Fame, or Honour Feminal, Or gentle Love, sole King of Pleasures natural. XLVII Als by her side, in richest Robes array'd, An Eunuch sate, of Visage pale and dead, Unseemly Paramour for Royal Maid! Yet Him she courted oft and honoured, And oft would by her place in Princely Seat or Place. Sted, Though from the Dregs of Earth he springen were, And oft with Regal Crowns she deck'd his Head, And oft, to sooth her vain and foolish Ear, She bade him the great Names of mighty Emperors. Kesars bear. XLVIII Thereto Herself a pompous Title bore, For she was vain of her great Auncestry, But vainer still of that prodigious Store Of Arts and Learning, which she vaunts to lye In the rich Archives of her Treasury. These she to Strangers oftentimes would shew, With grave Demean and solemn Vanity, Then proudly claim as to her Merit due The venerable Praise and Title of Vertù. XLIX Vertù she was Called or named. yclpe'd, and held her Court With outward Shews of Pomp and Majesty, To which natheless few others did resort, But Men of base and vulgar Industry, Or such perdy as of them cozened be, Mimes, Fidlers, Pipers, Eunuchs squeaking fine, Painters and Builders, Sons of Masonry, Who well could measure with the Rule and Line, And all the Orders five right craftily define. L But other Skill of cunning Architect, How to contrive the House for dwelling best, With self-sufficient Scorn they wont neglect, As corresponding with their Purpose least; And herein be they copied of the rest, Who aye pretending Love of Science fair, And gen'rous Purpose to adorn the Breast With Liberal Arts, to Vertù's Court repair, Yet nought but Tunes and Names, and Coins away do bear. LI For long, to visit her once-honour'd Seat The studious Sons of Learning have forbore; Who whilom thither ran with Pilgrim Feet Her venerable Reliques to adore, And load their Bosoms with the sacred Store, Whereof the World large Treasure yet enjoys. But Since. sithence she declin'd from Wisdom's Lore, They left her to display her pompous Toys To Virtuosi vain and wonder-gaping Boys. LII For-thy to Her a numerous Train doth Belong. long Of Ushers in her Court well practised, Who aye about the monied Stranger throng, Off'ring with Shews of courteous Good Nature or Civility. Bountihed Him through the rich Apartments all to lead, And shew him all the Wonders of her State, Whose Names and Price they wisely can Relate or declare. areed, And tell of Coins of old and modern Date, And Pictures false and true right well discriminate. LIII Als are they named after Him, whose Tongue These undersort of Antiquaries, who go about with Strangers to shew them the Antiquities &amp;c. of Rome are call'd Ciceroni. Shook the Dictator in his Curule Chair, And thundring through the Roman Senate rung His bold Philippicks in Antonius' Ear; Which when the Fairy heard, he sigh'd full dear, And casting round his quick discerning Eye, At every At every Turn, every now and then deal he dropt a manly Tear, As he the stately Buildings mote descry, Baths, Theatres and Fanes in mouldring Fragments lye. LIV And, Oh! Imperial City! then he said, How art thou tumbled from thine Alpine Throne! Whereon, like Jove on high Olympus Head, Thou sittedst erst unequal'd and alone, And madedst through the World thy Greatness known; While from the Western Isles, to Indus' shore, From seven-mouth'd Nilus, to the frozen Don, Thy dradded Bolts the strong-pounc'd Eagle bore, And taught the Nations round thy Fasces to adore! LV And doth among thy Reliques nought remain, No little Portion of that haughty Spright? Which made thee whilom scorn soft Pleasure's Chain And in free Virtue place thy chief Delight, Whereby through Ages shone thy Glory bright? And is there nought remaining to confound Those, who regardless of thy woeful Plight, With idle Wonder view thy Ruins round, And without Thought survey thy memorable Wound? LVI Arise thou genuine Cicero, and declare That all these mighty Ruins scattered wide, The Sepulchres of Roman Virtue were, And Trophies vast of Luxury and Pride, Those fell Diseases whereof Rome erst died. And do you then with vile Mechanick Thought Your Course, ye Sons of Fairy, hither guide, That ye those gay Refinements may be taught, Which Liberty's fair Lond to Shame and Thraldom brought? LVII Let Rome those Vassal Arts now meanly boast Which to her vanquish'd Thralls she erst resign'd; Ye who enjoy that Freedom she hath lost That great Prerogative of Human-kind, Close to your Hearts the precious Jewel bind, And learn the rich Possession to maintain, Learn Virtue, Justice, Constancy of Mind, Not to be mov'd by Fear or Pleasure's Train, These be your Arts, ye Brave, these only are Humane. LVIII As he thus spake, th'Echaunter half asham'd Wist not what fitting Answer to devise, Als was his caitive Heart well-nigh inflam'd, By that same Knight so vertuous, brave, and wise, That long he doubts him farther to entice. But he was hardened and remorseless grown, Through Practice old of Villainy and Vice; So to his former Wiles he turns him soon, As in another Place hereafter shall be shown. FINIS.</field>
