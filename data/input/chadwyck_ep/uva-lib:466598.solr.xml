      <field name="fulltext">TO THE READER. Not for the gay and thoughtless do I weave These plaintive strains; they have not learned to grieve, Their joyous days, mirth, health, and gladness wing; The laughing hours around them dance and sing: The light within their dwellings is not gone; Their cherished plants no worm has fed upon: These are the few in such a world as this;— The many scarcely taste the cup of bliss, Ere some rude stroke, e'en while its sweets they sip, Dashes it (oft for ever) from their lip. For such, for such alone, I tune my lay; They feel life's path a rough and thorny way; And, looking sadly round, no longer find Those who shed gladness on the track behind, Strewed it with flowers, illumed it with their smile, And toil, and care, and sorrow could beguile. These, as they pass along, depressed, forlorn, Suffering from man's neglect, perchance his scorn, Feeling the world no balsam can bestow, To soothe the aching heart, or medicine woe, May, midst their sorrows, lend a listening ear To strains whose purpose is their grief to cheer; To tell them where another heart found rest, Once, like their own, disquieted, unblessed, And where, though sought in vain on earthly ground, A balm of sovereign virtue may be found. SONNET TO THE HARP. Poor tuneless harp! I take thee to my Lord; Though all unmeet to offer at his shrine, If he endue my hand with skill divine, Sweet melody shall breathe from every chord; And thou to that high use shall be restored, Which erst in sinless paradise was thine: I lay thee at his feet, no longer mine; The strings all mute till wakened at his word. Oh! thou wert formed in those unsullied days, When joy, love, innocence, attuned each lyre, To blend thy music with celestial lays; And e'en my notes shall mingle with that choir, If He, th' eternal soul of harmony, Now, by his Spirit, deign to breathe on me. INVOCATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. Blessed Spirit! Thou who deignest, In each bosom where thou reignest, Heavenly thoughts to inspire; Now, thy gracious influence lending, With my strain its virtue blending, Wake my simple lyre! Let it breathe some hallowed numbers, Ere in death the minstrel slumbers, Who implores thy skill; Let it soothe some ear that listens, Let it dry some tear that glistens, Ere my heart be still! There are bosoms wrung with anguish; Mourners who in silence languish; Hidden wounds that bleed. Heavenly comforter of sorrow! Balm for these if I might borrow, I were bless'd indeed. THE MINSTREL. Within a darkened room I saw one sit, Touching a plaintive lyre, Upward she looked, and then her eye seemed lit With transient fire: But ever and anon I heard her sigh, And ever and anon tears filled her eye. Deep thoughts oppressed her, and I heard her say, “Oh! sad is human life! I see dark forms attend the pilgrim's way,— Care, suffering, strife; His toilsome journey is beset with foes, And death stands waiting at its awful close. But hush!” she said, and paused; then seemed awhile To hear one speak: Her dark thoughts vanished, and a peaceful smile Played on her cheek. Once more she listened, tuned her lyre again, Then soft and low, breathed forth a heaven-taught strain. ADDRESS TO SORROW. From heavenly mines I borrow The gems to form thy crown; In this poor world, sweet Sorrow! Thy worth is little known. And yet no angel's mission Can brighter gifts impart, Than thou, man's kind physician, If welcomed by the heart. The fatal mists around him Disperse at thy approach; The magic spells that bound him Are broken by thy touch. Thou throw'st thy mournful shading O'er earth's delusive joy; And then its bright hues fading, Nor dazzle nor decoy. Then when the world looks dreary, And when with grief oppressed, The sufferer, faint and weary, Seeks out some place of rest; Then, Sorrow! thou dost guide him To Penitence and Faith; These place fair Hope beside him, To cheer his heavenward path. Sweet thoughts of comfort bringing, Peace o'er his heart they shed In strains seraphic singing— “Thou shalt be comforted!” The tree of life disclosing Its odorous balm revealed; Beneath its shade reposing, His every wound is healed. And now, thy task completed, Thy mission at an end; The weary wanderer greeted By Him, “The Sinner's Friend;” If still thine aid He borrow, Thy chastening hand employ, Thy sweet associate, Sorrow! Will from that hour, be Joy. TO A MOURNER. A voice beloved, thus spoke of late, In sad yet chastened tone— “My heart at times is desolate. “I feel alone.” I looked upon that loved one's brow, And read the traces there: Those who have suffered learn to know Of grief and care. Though now the storms have passed away, Enough remains to mark That life has been a wintry day, Stormy and dark. So stands some tempest-riven tree, Its fairest branches gone; It ne'er what once it was, can be, Ere storms came down. Yet, mourner, though tears filled my eye, And dimmed my thoughtful gaze, I looked on thee rejoicingly, And gave God praise. What though thine earthly hopes are crushed Thine earthly wishes crossed, Those voices sweet in silence hushed, That cheered thee most: Does not a voice more cheering still New hopes, new joys impart? And thoughts of holiest power instil, To heal thy heart? Hast thow not meekly learned to bow, With acquiescing love, To Him whose hand has brought thee low, His love to prove? Does not thy faith strike deeper roots? Blest who that faith possess! Are there not formed the peaceful fruits Of righteousness? Oh, yes! The process I behold, And joyfully admire, Through which thou wilt come forth as gold Tried in the fire. Concealed from man the dross may lie, Now with the metal mixed; But on it the Refiner's eye Is calmly fixed. Nor will He leave (this thought is joy,) The gold He thus refines, Till in it, pure from all alloy, His image shines. THE WANDERER. There was a wanderer once who sought in vain At earthly fountains to assuage her thirst; For though they sparkled and seemed sweet at first, Soon, unabated, it returned again; But He who marks and pities human pain, Whose eye of love seeks out the lost, the worst, Met her, in mercy infinite, as erst Another wanderer on Samaria's plain; He led her to that living stream which flows From heavenly founts, the pilgrim to restore; And there she quenched her thirst, and found that those Who drink that water thirst again no more, But hasten on, through strength divinely given, E'en till they reach the fountain-head in heaven. THE CONTRITE HEART. There is a holy sacrifice, Which God himself will not despise; Nay, more, Jehovah deigns to prize The contrite heart. That “high and lofty One,” whose praise Inspires the rapt archangels' lays, With favourable eye surveys The contrite heart. The Holy One, the Son of God, His presence there will shed abroad, And consecrate, as his abode, The contrite heart. The blessed Spirit, from on high, Will listen to its faintest sigh, And heal, and cheer, and purify The contrite heart. Saviour! I make my prayer to thee; Such as thou lovest I fain would be. In mercy, Lord, bestow on me A contrite heart! THE ÆOLIAN HARP. I heard an Æolian harp, when the wings Of the soft summer-zephyr flew light o'er the strings, Waking sounds like the far-distant curfew that flings Echoes broken and faint down the vale: But I heard it again, when the winter's cold blast Swept roughly and rudely each chord as it past, Then the strange spirit-minstrelsy, wakened at last, Swelled, fitful and wild, in the gale. When summer and sunshine breathe perfume around, And earth by the Christian an Eden is found, The notes of his harp indistinctly resound; Too faintly his praises are given; But when on his bosom the winter-winds beat, When the blast of the desert lays bare his retreat, When the storm which has crushed him wakes concords so sweet, Angels listen, and waft them to heaven. S. MATTHEW, v. I stood in spirit on that sacred mount, Where He who spoke as man could never speak, With Godlike power and majesty, though meek, Poured words of life from truth's eternal fount. A few poor men, plain and of no account, Were nearest to Him: them his eye would seek, While from its glance love's radiance seemed to break, And beam o'er multitudes too vast to count. I strove, as from an oracle divine, To catch some words to treasure in my heart, And though a distant place, alas! was mine. And those dear accents reached me but in part, One hallowed sentence to my ear was borne: The words were these; “Blessed are they that mourn.” RETROSPECTION. O! how oft, unseen, unknown, Does “the soul of feeling” Muse on friends far off, or gone, Memory's stores unsealing. O'er the track of years gone by, Pleased the spirit wanders; Breathes o'er many a spot a sigh, Many a record ponders. Scenes which long have disappeared, From their sleep awaken; Sounds by loved lost friends endeared, Joys by them partaken. Funeral tokens rise around, The full heart o'erpowering; Urns with many a garland bound, Cypress-trees embowering. Bright and fragrant there appear Flowers of recollection; Bathed by many a holy tear, Nursed by fond affection. O! ye loved, lamented few! Once to me united, Heavenward by each thought of you Be my soul incited! THE VALLEY OF TEARS. When I entered on life, and my fancy was gay, When hope's rosy dawning illumined my way, When the paths were all flowery, untrodden, and green, And pleasure and novelty gladdened the scene, The sound was unwelcome and strange to my ears, When they called this fair region “a valley of tears.” But the days of enchantment flew rapidly past, And the sunshine within and without was o'ercast; The tints of the morning soon melted away, The buds and sweet blossoms proved transient as they; And I owned, with a sigh, that life sometimes appears A sorrowful path through a valley of tears. Still onward I journeyed, but journeyed alone, For I found that with novelty pleasure had flown, My path grew insipid; I slackened my pace, And longed the fair track I had passed to retrace; For I said, “What a different aspect it wears From this, which is really a valley of tears!” But while with reluctance I granted it true, My spirit recoiled from so altered a view; And because disappointment had broken the cup Presented by fancy, replenished by hope, She spurned, in her bitterness, all that still cheers This region of shadows, this valley of tears. I looked on it now as a desolate spot, Where sin, linked with sorrow, wide ruin had wrought; And where'er I discovered some lingering trace Of its early magnificence, beauty, and grace, It seemed but to tell me of happier years, Ere the world was transformed to a valley of tears. My soul grew impatient and weary of life, As a scene of distress, disappointment, and strife, And beheld in herself, and each pilgrim below, But the victims of suffering, delusion, and woe,— All doomed, for a period of sorrowful years, To mourn, or to toil, in the valley of tears. For as yet she discerned not a country more bright Than that which so early had ceased to delight; Nor sources of pure and more permanent bliss, That can spring from a soil so polluted as this: She felt not the mercy which gladdens and cheers The Christian's abode in the valley of tears. But now, while I keep that fair country in view, With hope and with patience my path I pursue; In sadness and weariness sweet the belief, That my home is not distant, my journey but brief; And that, when I have passed a few troublesome years, I shall wander no more in the valley of tears. THE SKYLARK. How sweet is the song of the lark as she springs To welcome the morning with joy on her wings! As higher she rises, more sweetly she sings, And she sings when we hear her no more. When storms and dark clouds veil the sun from our sight, She has mounted above them; she shines in his light; There, far from the scenes that disturb and affright, She loves her gay music to pour. It is thus with the Christian: he sees, from afar, The day-spring appearing, the bright morning star; He quits this dark valley of sorrow and care, For the land whence the radiance is given: He sings on his way from this cloud covered spot, The swifter his progress, the sweeter his note: When we hear it no longer, the song ceases not;— It blends with the chorus of heaven. THE MOON OVER THE SEA. O! fix on that beautiful planet thine eye; Observe her bright course as she travels on high, And bears, like a vestal, her lamp through the sky, Arrayed in her garments of light; While pure and exalted her pathway she treads, O'er the rough sea beneath her, soft radiance she sheds; Where'er she approaches, the darkness recedes, Till, in beauty, she glides from our sight. Fair orb! there are some in this world of our own, Like thyself, who in light and in silence move on; They walk in “white raiment,” and calmly look down On life's turbulent ocean beneath: The noise of its waves at a distance they hear: And, shedding soft light from their luminous sphere, This region of darkness and sorrow they cheer, And are beautiful even in death. ON SACRED MUSIC. It is said that the exile who chances to hear, In the land of the stranger his own native tongue, Or some strain that in childhood delighted his ear, Though he listen with rapture, yet weeps o'er the song. For then what bright visions appear to his view! What scenes of enchantment rise quickly around! The land where the first breath of freedom he drew, His home, his loved kindred, he seems to have found! But though sweet the delusion, not long can it last: In a moment the lovely deceptions are flown: With the sounds that produced them, too quickly they passed, And the exile still finds himself sad and alone. And is not the Christian an exile on earth? And is not sweet music the language of heaven, Of that land whence the spirit received her high birth, And from whence the bright grant of her freedom was given? And thus, while he listens to anthems of praise, Or some soft-stealing melody falls on his ear, Those regions of joy he in spirit surveys, And seems the sweet song of the ransomed to hear. Nay, he seems to have entered that haven of rest, To have bidden farewell to temptations and woes. Already he joins the bright bands of the blest, Already partakes their eternal repose. But the charm is soon broken; the sounds die away; No mandate, as yet, is sent down of release: He mourns to perceive still so distant the day, When his suff'rings and labours for ever shall cease. That day of delight, when, an exile no more, His country, his home, his loved friends he regains, Tunes his harp to the chorus oft longed for before, Where “sorrow and sighing” ne'er blend with the strains. ON THE SAME SUBJECT. When music entrances my ear, While I yield to its mystic control, Still the sounds so delightful to hear, Never reach the dark depths of the soul. She has sighs, and complainings, and woes, Which melody charms not to rest; And though sweet be the tear as it flows, The lone spirit within is unblest. But, oh! when, as borne from above, Hallowed voices breathe accents of praise, They waft to that region of love The spirit which thrills to their lays. For then, their sweet melodies bless That name which is balm for all woe; And the heart from its inmost recess, Echoes back the loved sounds as they flow. STANZAS FOR A FRIEND IN SORROW. It must be so; the feeling heart must oft receive a wound; Must often be compelled to part from those it twined around: It must be so; life's shadows still must lengthen o'er our way, And darkness those bright places fill, where shone joy's sunniest ray. It must be so; the hopes of youth, the schemes gay fancy wove, The fictions we believed as truth, must all delusive prove; And e'en in manhood's riper day, with wisdom for our guide, The prop selected for our stay oft proves a reed when tried. It must be so; our hours of bliss, like a sweet April gleam, Just smile on such a world as this, then vanish like a dream; Hope's Iris, with its beauteous braid, melts in the clouds it wreathes; Joy's roseate flower begins to fade, e'en while its fragrance breathes. It must be so; the friends beloved, who cheered life's earlier day, By time estranged, by death removed, pass one by one away; Till oft, ere half its sands can fall, we look around and sigh— “How many now my tears recall whose smile once blest my eyes!” While o'er the heart these changes come, and man, earth's transient guest, Learns that the soul has here no home, no seat of tranquil rest; Then whither turns that eye, now dim with disappointed hope? Asks he fair Truth to draw for him, her heavenly horoscope? Alas! too oft he turns to grief; calls back enjoyments past, Lives o'er again those moments brief, too blest, too bright to last; Forgets that bitters marred the sweet, and thorns the flowers, e'en then; Feels that his sun of bliss has set, and twilight days remain. Or if from Grief he pass away, to seek a sterner guide, Philosophy! he courts thy sway, thy loftier code is tried: But Reason the firm mind may win, and nerve its high resolves, While on its axis, dark within, the restless heart revolves. 'Tis braced and disciplined, not healed; its wounds are stanched, not cured; These moral anodynes but yield calm midst the pain endured: Not this the kind result designed, by Him who, from above, Thus breaks each tie too strongly twined, that we may seek His love. E'en as the bird “stirs up her nest,” to make her nurslings fly, He here forbids us to find rest, towards heaven to raise our eye: The sunshine is from earth removed, that heaven more bright may seem, The heart denied what most it loved, till there He reign supreme. Then all around a light is shed, which ne'er will fade away; More radiant grows the path we tread, e'en “to the perfect day;” Each wound is healed, each want supplied, joys given which leave us never; The heart's deep longing satisfied, and satisfied for ever. THE REQUIEM. I possessed a sweet flower; it bloomed for a while; Its sweetness was wont every care to beguile, But I cherished too fondly the flower: I viewed as one of the blossoms of heaven, To which beauty and fragrance perennial are given, Nor thought it could fade in an hour. For it seemed to belong to that region of love, And reminded me oft of the climate above, Where all is refreshing and pure; It was granted to brighten my sojourn on earth, And to raise my poor heart to the land of its birth; But its charms not for me might endure. While I watched o'er its beauties with anxious delight, It received from some blast an invisible blight, Its colours began to decay; At length when I sought it, I found it no more: It died not:—I trust to a happier shore Some angel has borne it away. Had I prized it less fondly, it still had been mine; But He who bestowed it, in bounty divine, Took it back, not in wrath, but in love: Its fragrance for me formed an Eden on earth; And I seldom remembered the land of its birth, That lovelier Eden above. But the charm is now broken, the danger is o'er: Life has one joy the less, and one sorrow the more, And my heart for a season must mourn: The sweeter the fragrance the blossom bestows, The brighter the colours, the richer the rose, The sharper the pang of the thorn. Sweet blossom, farewell! I shall treasure each leaf Thou hast scattered around me, to soften my grief, Thy memory their worth will enhance: These relics, so sadly endeared to my sight, Not now will awaken too fond a delight, Too sweetly my senses entrance. And oh! when my path through the desert is o'er, May thy sweet living blossoms delight me once more, In that land where the plants never die; Where enjoyment with danger no more is combined; Where the strongest yet purest attachment will bind, And no parting bring tears the eye. Till then, sweetest plant! I must bid thee farewell; Long, long will thy charms in my memory dwell: Long, long for thy loss shall I mourn: No plant of the earth shall succeed thee, sweet flower! No blossom be nursed in my desolate bower: I have felt too severely the thorn. ON NOAH'S DOVE. A SIMILITUDE. Oh, soul of man! like that poor dove distrest, Winging o'er life's dark waves thy weary flight, Seeking in vain some “isle of beauty bright,” Some spot where thine exhausted wing may rest; Fly to the heavenly ark, that haven blest, Where, till a spring shall bloom which knows no blight, Thou shalt be safe from storms, by day, by night; And Peace, sweet Peace, shall build thy downy nest. I see one waiting to “put forth his hand,” And take thee in, poor, weary fluttering heart! Fear not his gentle touch; though weak thou art, None like himself thy frame can understand: Such life, warmth. comfort, strength, that touch will bring, Soon shall thou raise thy drooping head and sing. THE VESTAL. Oh! who has not paused, as he read, to admire The tale of that ancient mysterious fire, Never suffered on peril of life, to expire,— Everlasting, though kindled below? And viewed the pale Vestal, all lonely, at night, Her eye ever fixed on that mystical light; Now feeding the flame, lest it cease to burn bright, Now her features illumed by its glow? A task as unceasing, though nobler, is thine, O Christian! the priest of a holier shrine; In thy heart has been lit by the Spirit divine A flame which eternal must prove: Like the Vestal, watch o'er it by night and by day, Let neglect never cause its pure beam to decay: Thy life is involved in still brightening its ray, Till removed to the temple above. ON A SPRING MORNING. Thou! who art ever present, though unseen, Amid these beauteous shades I feel Thee near: I seem to stand beside Thee, and to hear That voice which makes the troubled heart serene. I love to think Thou on this earth hast been, And once in human form didst sojourn here, Where still Thou deignest invisibly to cheer Each fainting spirit that on Thee would lean. Oh! while in hill and dale, and stream and flower, With tearful joy thy glories I behold, On me display thy wonder-working power! Bid each long-dormant heavenly seed unfold; And while around woods, hills, and valleys sing, Within my heart wake a celestial spring! ON AN EARLY VIOLET. Scarcely has one bright sunbeam shone, Or vernal zephyr waved its wing; Yet is thy fragrance round me thrown, Sweet child of spring; 'Mid leafless shrubs, on the cold earth, Rises thy soft and beauteous form, Familiar, even from thy birth, With many a storm. There, blooming in thy lonely bed, Enfolded in thy mantle green. Thy solitary sweets were shed, Unknown, unseen. Yet, could the balmiest breath of May To the one added charm have lent? Could brighter tints thy leaves inlay, Or sweeter scent? 'Tis often thus; the richest flowers That in the soul's fair garden blow, Are nurtured by rough winds and showers, 'Mid scenes of woe. When earthly joys lie all untombed, And life looks desolate and drear, Then first hope's heavenly flower has bloomed, The heart to cheer. Nay, thus in sorrow's wintry day, The soul herself, 'mid blast and storm, Gains beauties whieh joy's summer-ray Will rarely form. Nor shall one blast around her blow, One storm on her fair blossoms beat, But shall a lovelier hue bestow, A scent more sweet. THE “STILL SMALL VOICE.” There is a voice, “a still small voice,” of love, Heard from above; But not amidst the din of earthly sounds, Which here confounds; By those withdrawn apart it best is heard, And peace, sweet peace, breathes in each gentle word. In the sick chamber, oft when none are near, This voice sounds clear; Then o'er the wearied frame, the suffering bed, Repose is shed: Its whispers fall like balm upon the soul, Each pang to soothe, each murmur to control. Oft on the day of consecrated rest, This unseen guest Visits the lonely and sequestered room, Dispels its gloom, And pours such sacred melody around, That not an angel's harp more sweet could sound, In that appalling stillness which prevails, Where nature fails, When naught is heard save the convulsive breath, Struggling with death, Then will this voice of mercy gently break That saddest silence, and of comfort speak. Oh! blessed then, the sufferer, though he mourn, To whom are born The gracious accents of this heavenly guide! None, none beside Can calm the spirit, bend the opposing will, And say, with voice omnipotent, “Be still!” TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Sweet chantress! from every blossoming tree There is wafted a song of rejoicing and glee; Midst the mirth and the music I listen for thee, But thy melody charms not my ear. When the sun shall descend, and the blossoms all close, When darkness and stillness shall usher repose, Oh then, while the night-breeze refreshingly blows, Thy song from afar I shall hear. Sweet chantress! a beautiful emblem thou art, Of the pure and devoted and tranquillized heart, When, from earthly turmoil and intrusion apart, It holds converse with regions above; Beneath that blue concave, so peaceful and bright, Sweet symphonies break on the silence of night; While angels bend down, with approving delight, Taking part in the anthems they love. A SEARCH AFTER HAPPINESS. If happiness be sought aright, She will be found;—though hidden, Her doors stand open day and night, And none will be forbidden. Yet thousands seek her still in vain, Bewildered, discontented; Fatigued they roam o'er hill and plain, In paths she ne'er frequented. I joined the throng; I sought the prize; 'Twas long before I found it; I ne'er resigned the enterprise, Till full success had crowned it. I sought her in an emerald glen, Where Nature's charms delighted; They said, “she dwelt there, once, with men, But long those scenes had quitted.” I next explored the festive bower, To which gay Pleasure wooed me; And quickly found that Folly wore Her features, to delude me. At length, in Friendship's sweet abode, Her lovely form I greeted; Oh, with what joy my bosom glowed! The hours like moments fleeted! But Death, her mortal foe, appeared, Those ties of love to sever; She fled that spot, so much endeared, Abandoned it for ever! In Fancy's flower-enamelled vale Once more my eye beheld her; But Thought was with me:—she turned pale, And vanished ere I held her. Then Science said, “his temple fair,” “Oft gathered groups around her;” Told me the Muses met her there;— I sought, but never found her! In Superstition's ancient pile, Where monks their beads were telling, Where, through the dimly-lighted aisle, The midnight chant was swelling; E'en there for Happiness I sought, I wept, and prayed, and fasted; I sought her, but I found her not: Prayers, penance, tears, were wasted. Worn out at last, I raised my eye To Heaven, its guidance seeking; At once a gentle sound stole by;— Her own sweet voice was speaking. “Pilgrim! a gracious ear is lent To thy sad heart's petition; When the heart's cry to heaven is sent, At once it gains admission. “When asked from Him whom I obey, Thus freely He bestows me; None but the heart that owns His sway Receives, or even knows me. “Your world, my blissful seat of old, Is now by sin polluted: None there, till cast in heavenly mould, To dwell with me are suited, “Above yon bright and starry sphere, With spirits pure and sainted, I breathe a holier atmosphere, By sin and woe untainted. “Mid those immortal shapes I stand, Jehovah's throne surrounding, Who strike their harps at His right hand, Angelic songs resounding. “But to the earth my flight I speed, Soon as the contrite-hearted Need me, to bind the wounds that bleed: Thenceforth, we are not parted. “When, on the Sabbath, they are found The sacred courts attending, I love to tread that holy ground, My voice with theirs is blending. “And in the hour of humble prayer, Who feels the Saviour's presence, Will never fail to meet me there: It forms my very essence. “Now, through thy life's short pilgrimage, Unseen I will be near thee; And in its last, its roughest stage, My voice shall calm and cheer thee. “Then will I join the convoy bright Sent down thy bonds to sever, Hail thy deliverance with delight, And be thine own for ever!” THE HOUR OF PRAYER. My God! is any hour so sweet, From blush of morn to evening-star, As that which calls me to thy feet,— The hour of prayer? Blest is that tranquil hour of morn, And blest that hour of solemn eve, When on the wings of prayer up-borne, The world I leave! For then a day-spring shines on me, Brighter than morn's ethereal glow; And richer dews descend from thee Than earth can know. Then is my strength by thee renewed; Then are my sins by thee forgiven; Then dost thou cheer my solitude With hope of heaven. No words can tell what sweet relief There for my every want I find, What strength for warfare, balm for grief, What peace of mind. Hushed is each doubt; gone every fear; My spirit seems in heaven to stay: And e'en the penitential tear Is wiped away. Lord! till I reach yon blissful shore, No privilege so dear shall be, As thus my inmost soul to pour In prayer to thee. A PRAYER AT MIDNIGHT. Celestial Spirit! now, in this calm hour, Thy meanest temple with thy presence fill! “I commune with my own heart, and am still,” Waiting to feel thy tranquillising power. Darkness is round me; but, like that pale flower, The night-blowing Ceres. Which loves its vestal fragrance to distil When other flowers are closed, on dale and hill, Breathed but for him who trained it for his bower,— Thus, blessed Spirit! be it now with me; In this poor heart, thy consecrated shrine, Thy hand has formed, and trained a plant divine, Unseen, unknown, unnurtured, but by thee: Now be the hidden perfume thou hast given Exhaled, like incense sweet, and borne to heaven! “THE LORD TURNED, AND LOOKED UPON PETER.” St. Luke, xxii. 61. Oh! it is ever thus. That eye benign Beams on the soul with tenderness divine, E'en ere the wanderer owns that he has strayed, E'en ere the penitent has wept or prayed, And, when that look, that pitying look is felt, The softened heart in contrite grief will melt, Mourn that against such goodness it has striven, And “love him much” who has so “much forgiven.” The Saviour changes not, but now sends down, E'en from His glorious mediatorial throne, Whence all our wandering footsteps He can trace, The same sweet tokens of forgiving grace. Oh! let the trembling and desponding mind, That “broken spirit” which He loves to bind, Dwell on each proof of tenderness He gave, Nor doubt His willingness to heal and save! Not e'en the fondest love a mother knows,— The warmest in a human breast which glows,— No loftiest, best conception we can raise, E'en the faint outline of His love portrays. Poor, doubting mourner! yield not to thy fears; Each tear He numbers, and each sigh He hears; And though, like Peter, thou hast wronged thy Lord, Like him, thou mayest be pardoned and restored. For thee thy Saviour's prayer may yet prevail; True faith in Him, though weak, shall never fail; But lead thee, in His strength, henceforth to prove, Through life, in death, thy gratitude and love. REST FOR THE WEARY. Has earthly love deceived thee? Has earthly friendship grieved thee? Has Death's strong hand bereaved thee Of all most dear below? A love which never changes, A Friend no time estranges, A land Death's shaft ne'er ranges. It may be thine to know. In vain have men asserted, To cheat the weary-hearted, That powers by sin perverted, Themselves can calm the breast. One hand alone unfailing, Sin, grief's dark root, assailing, O'er all within prevailing, Can give the weary rest. TO ONE SUFFERING FROM DEAFNESS. What though thine earthly cottage veil Some beams that cheer the pilgrim's way, The soul's bright senses cannot fail, Nor pass away. Thine ear of faith may listen ever To sounds which bid all sorrow cease, Which importune or weary never, But whisper peace. It may be that thine outward ear Is closed to earth's tumultuous din, That those blest accents full and clear, May speak within. What though the “nether springs” run low, Which cheered thy pilgrim-path at first, The “upper springs” perennial flow To quench thy thirst. If on thy Saviour rests thine eye, The loss of sense faith's gain will be; For it will closer draw the tie 'Twixt him and thee. ON A FROSTY EVENING. When the dark mantle of o'ershadowing night Wraps in concealment all the world below, With countless orbs yon azure vault doth glow, In silence shining, beautiful and bright, The midnight wanderer gazes with delight, And feels his heart within him overflow. “O! what,” he asks, “can day's broad sunshine show, To rival yon fair field of argent light?” —'Tis sometimes thus, when sorrow's mournful shade Darkens our path, and veils our prospects here: Fair worlds, unseen before, are then displayed, And in surpassing majesty appear; For then to faith's uplifted eye 'tis given To view the glories of a brighter heaven. TO AN AGED CHRISTIAN ON HIS BIRTH-DAY. Now, pilgrim! of thy journey home, But one short stage remains; And, brightening through the evening's gloom Across the distant plains, Methinks thine eye may catch a sight Of that sweet shore of rest, Where friends are waiting, robe in white, To hail the expected guest; Where every hope, yet incomplete, Each unfulfilled desire, Fruition's plenitude shall meet, Till bliss can rise no higher. O! did our hearts indeed receive, Faith in her power sublime, The Christian would rejoice, not grieve, To mark the lapse of time. Nature may weep o'er life's short span, When forms we love decay: Faith views the immortal inward man, And wipes the tear away. And when we feel we cannot now Shelter one heart we prize From many a conflict, many a woe, Or hush its secret sighs; Then, as we see them onward borne, By time's resistless flow, To that bright shore where none can mourn, Where glory crowns each brow; Should we not hail their nearer bliss, When faith's sure hope is given! What means “advancing age,” but this,— The drawing near to heaven? ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF A CHILD'S DEATH. This was thy heavenly birth-day, much loved boy! Dost thou not wonder at thy parents' tears, And question why so sad that day appears, Which crowned their darling with unfading joy? Why do they now their mournful thoughts employ In fondly dwelling on thy few short years? For Memory, while she thus the past endears, Blends with the sweet her bitterest alloy. Oh! if the birth-day of a life like ours, In this dark world of trouble and unrest, Be hailed with gratulations, gifts, and flowers, Should not thine entrance on a life so blest E'en as a sacred jubilee be kept, And not a tear, but tears of joy, be wept? TO A WIDOWED FRIEND. Why dost thou haste so swiftly on thy way, Like one whose company before is gone? What is that stedfast eye so fixed upon, Beaming, at times, as with a heavenly ray? Alas! that mourning veil, that dark array, Tell me that thou from bitter grief hast won A disentangled heart, no longer prone To make terrestrial things thy staff and stay. What though thy cheek be paler, lone thy path, What though, unseen, sad Memory tears will shed, Now thou wilt live indeed the life of faith, Till thou shalt meet again thy “holy dead.” Oh! if by grief such blessings here are given, What “weight of glory” will be thine in heaven! “SHE GOETH UNTO THE GRAVE TO WEEP THERE.” Oh! go not to his grave to weep, Bathe not with tears his early tomb; Angels that precious seed will keep, Till thence the immortal flower shall bloom. Oh! go not to his grave to mourn That he was once so fair, so bright; A form far lovelier shall be borne From that low bed, to bless thy sight. Oh! go not to his grave to sigh, Because his transient date is o'er; That which we here miscall “to die,” Means but to live for evermore. Go to his grave, that light to hail Which o'er it now from Calvary streams; Which shines through death's once mournful vale, And on thy slumbering infant beams. Go to his grave, that God to bless, Who to his happy soul has given More than thine utmost tenderness Could supplicate,—a home in heaven. Go to his grave, to offer there, As laid on thy Redeemer's shrine, Thy loveliest flower, thy first-born fair, And say, “He was not ours, but thine.” FROM A DYING CHILD. Cease, my mother! to deplore me, Cease to ask my longer stay! Angel-forms are bending o'er me, Hark! they call my soul away. Wipe those tears so sadly falling, Upward turn thy weeping eyes; Heavenly messengers are calling Me, thy child, to Paradise. Hear'st thou not those sweetest numbers? Hear'st thou not that softest strain, Sent to bless my dying slumbers, Sent to soothe my dying pain? Soon these pangs of struggling nature Shall my prison doors unclose; Soon each calm and tranquil feature Wear a smile of sweet repose. But when this poor frame is sleeping Cold within the silent tomb, Wilt thou still be fondly weeping O'er thy babe's untimely doom? Wilt thou mourn the blissful sentence Which invites me to thy rest? Wilt thou mourn my early entrance On the glories of the blest? Wilt thou mourn my warfare ended? Mourn the prize too quickly gained? Life has long enough extended When its purpose is attained. Hark! again those notes are swelling: “Happy spirit, take thy flight; Quit that frail terrestrial dwelling; Wing thy way to realms of light.” Oh! what scenes arise before me! Lovelier far than aught beneath; Cease, my mother! to deplore me; Sweeter far than life is death. TO THE EVENING STAR. Lovely star! serenely shining On my heavy tearful eyes, Thou shalt check these thoughts repining, And repress these mournful sighs; Let thy way be dark, or bright, Still thou sheddest thy silvery light. Still thy heavenly track pursuing, Rapidly thou hastenest on, From that purer region viewing This dark world thou shinest upon; Passing o'er it but to lend Light to gladden and befriend. Thus, when clouds are passing o'er us, Grief our spirits may subdue; But a race “is set before us,” And, though faint, we must pursue; Lovely star! our model be; May we shine through clouds like thee! And, like thee, while freely lending Light to all within our sphere, To our unseen centre tending, Swift as bright may we appear! Then, when thy brief course is o'er, We shall rise to set no more. THE CHRISTIAN NEAR HIS HOME. I see an aged man Climbing the hill's steep side; Long has he trod the pilgrim's way, And now the sun's declining ray Homeward his steps will guide. A seat of rest Among the blest E'en now awaits in heaven the dear expected guest. His path is rough and steep, More toilsome near its close: The sky looks dark; the winds blow keen: The shadows lengthen o'er the scene, And scarce a flowerlet blows: The pilgrim's eye, Still fixed on high, Sees brighter worlds appear, beyond the darkening sky. At times, indeed, he grieves For earlier days more blest; When on the wings of joy he soared, And, with an eagle's strength, explored The land of promised rest; But faith still shoots Its downward roots; The blossoms pass away, but riper grow the fruits. Ill could he once have borne His present toilsome path; He feels no joy, yet murmurs not, This hushes each repining thought, “While here, I walk by faith.” He still can trace A Saviour's grace, Though he appear far off, and seem to hide his face. The heavenly prize he views, And still maintains his ground; The steep ascent is hard to win, And many a foe, without, within, Strives to inflict a wound; Though closely pressed, Hope cheers his breast; For soon the strife will cease, the weary be at rest. Pilgrim, the end is near! Though faint, yet still pursue; When thou shalt gain the mountain's brow A scene beyond conception now Shall burst upon thy view; Celestial air Shall fan thee there, And thou shalt bid adieu, to toil, and pain, and care. Then, thou shalt fall asleep, And angels waiting round Shall waft thee to that blissful shore, Seen dimly from afar before, Where golden harps resound; Where souls set free That Saviour see, Whose smile is heaven itself:—that smile will beam on thee. TO ONE RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY. Oh! it ne'er was intended a spirit like thine, Immortal in nature, in birthright divine, Should take up her home in a region like this Or rest short of perfection in virtue and bliss. I regret not that oft thou art weary, depressed, In the midst of heaven's bountiful blessings unblessed; For “the weary, the heavily laden” are those Whom a voice others hear not, invites to repose. Though nature and affluence and taste have combined, To surround thee with charms and enjoyments refined; On them all, looks of sadness or languor are thrown: And why? the true riches not yet are thine own. Arts, studies, accomplishments, friends, vainly still The void in thy desolate bosom would fill; For the smile on thy lip can but faintly disguise A heart that, in secret, for happiness sighs. There is a bright talisman, which, when possessed, Reveals the sweet source of contentment and rest; The stream will renew while it gladdens thy heart, And the lustre of joy to thy features impart. There is a blest volume;—each page it unrolls The nature and worth of this treasure extols; Oh, study that volume! the guidance there given Will lead not to happiness only, but heaven. “MY SON, GIVE ME THINE HEART.” Proverbs xxiii. 26. Feelest thou disquiet, care, unrest, Scarce knowing why so sad thou art? In God alone can man find rest: Give Him thine heart. Deemest thou thy bosom's secret woes Peculiar, from all else apart? Thy case He intimately knows: Give Him thine heart. Oft doth the painful thought arise, That slighted, misconceived, thou art? God knows thee, loves, will not despise: Give Him thine heart. Sailest thou alone o'er life's rough sea, Without a home, a friend, a chart? Thy friend, guide, haven, God will be: Give Him thine heart. Dost thou some hopeless sorrow feel, Some wound from Death's unpitying dart? Thy God will bind it up, and heal: Give Him thine heart. Are there some griefs thou canst not tell, Not to the dearest friends impart? Thy God will understand them well: Give Him thine heart. Oh! when without reserve 'tis given, Wholly surrendered, every part, There shines within, the dawn of heaven: Give Him thine heart. TO ONE BEREAVED OF MANY RELATIVES. Thou hast laid up so many treasures there, Where there is no more sorrow, no more pain, That I esteem thee rich in heavenly gain, E'en by the loss of those who dearest were. Oh, while thy deepest, tenderest, thoughts they share, When sad, and desolate, thou sighest in vain, Their voice to hear, their smile to meet again, Pour out thy heart, pour out thy griefs in prayer! That blest employ will reunite thy soul With those whose adorations never cease: That hallowed intercourse each grief control, And o'er thy bosom shed celestial peace. Though powerless human sympathy be found, Sweet converse with thy God can heal each wound. THE DEATH-BED OF A CHRISTIAN. And now the closing scene drew on; The tide of life was ebbing fast; Yet the firm hope she lent upon Sustained her, cheered her, to the last. The hectic flush had left her cheek, The fever's brilliancy her eye; Yet calm she smiled, though faint and weak, As if she felt it sweet to die. All on a sudden she beheld A form unknown approach her bed, Whose hand a drooping garland held, Where faded flowers their leaves had shed. Gently the mantle he withdrew, That first his features had concealed, And to the dying sufferer's view A sweet, though pallid, face revealed. Then, in soft accents he exclaimed, “Oh, happy one! be not dismayed; Thine hour of freedom is proclaimed, The summons given, the ransom paid. “I see thee smile, and stretch thy hand, As if to bid me draw more near; But wouldest thou not my touch withstand, If my true name had met thine ear? “I am that last resistless foe Who fills with dread the human breast; Whom fear and ignorance love to show In visionary terrors dressed. “But what's the phantom feared so much,— E'en from thy childhood feared by thee? What but a stroke, a voice, a touch, That sets the imprisoned spirit free? “My name the guilty may appal, Because I seal their fearful doom: But the believer loves the call That wafts his spirit to her home. “Oh, hasten, then, to lay aside These earthly weeds which clothe thee now! A fairer robe will be supplied, A brighter beauty deck thy brow. “Look on this pale and faded wreath, These flowers that once sweet fragrance shed; Chilled by the icy hand of death, Their tints are gone, their charms have fled! “Thus at my touch, thou too shalt fade; Thy breath shall cease, thy life be gone; And that loved form be darkly laid In its last resting-place alone. “Yet fear me not! with gentlest hand I will unloose thy bonds of clay; Then shall thy happy soul expand Her wings of joy, and soar away! “Soon wilt thou pass my shadowy vale, Beneath the heavenly hills it lies; Nor shall thine outstretched pinions fail, Till the bright city meet thine eyes. “Then to the glorious mansions there, Rejoicing saints will welcome thee; I must resign thee to their care, Those golden gates are closed to me.” He ceased;—the listener sweetly smiled, And seemed some vision to behold: With joy her parting soul was filled, Her heavenward eye of rapture told. Then faintly, brokenly was heard, The words between inverted commas were spoken by a dying Christian. “A day where no more night shall be! Entrance to me is ministered Abundantly! abundantly!” Then there was silence;—not a word Uttered the grief of those who wept; Ere long “a quite sigh” See Hooker's death, as described in Walton's lives. was heard, And she “in Jesus” sweetly slept. A DREAM. I walked upon an unknown shore; A deep, dark ocean rolled beside: Thousands were wafted swiftly o'er That silent and mysterious tide. Strange was the solemn scene, and new; My spirit sank with inward dread: No voice proclaimed it; but I knew Those were the regions of the dead. It was no earthly light that shone, Casting a shadowy gleam around; Ne'er midst an earthly throng was known Stillness so awful, so profound. The only sound which met the ear,— And sadly, heavily it fell,— Was the dark billow rolling near, With measured, melancholy swell. I sought with anxious eye to trace, Among the crowd that thronged the coast, The features of one well-known face, Fondly beloved, and lately lost. The twilight gleam sufficed to show Full many a face that once was fair, Now marked with characters of woe, The sad, sad impress of despair. No words were needed to express Whose tears of anguish fell too late; The dark fixed look of mute distress Declared too legibly their fate. Some have been lovely once on earth, Caressed, applauded, loved, admired, Endowed with riches, talents, birth, Possessing all their hearts desired. Those hearts, alas for them! were given To earthly pleasures, cares, and toys; They found not time to think of heaven, To seek imperishable joys. Slowly I turned, with many a sigh, From this sad spectacle of woe; And soon I saw the beaming eye Of her so fondly loved below. She had but just been called away From husband, parents, children, friends; Yet in that eye there shone a ray Of joy, with which no sadness blends. A bright companion at her side Looked on her with celestial love; Delighting her glad steps to guide Towards the bright home prepared above. Unseen I followed: It was sweet, O! passing sweet, her voice to hear: No earthly language could repeat The sounds that then entranced my ear. Swiftly we passed that gloomy shore; Darkness and clouds were all withdrawn: And then a light, not known before, Began upon our path to dawn. With growing strength I saw her tread Her upward, brightening, heavenward road, With joy she lifted up her head, To hail the city of her God! As nearer to that world we drew, Immortal fragrance filled the air; But soon the increasing radiance grew Too bright for mortal sense to bear. I only caught a distant glance Of glories, never to be told; I saw a beauteous band advance; I heard them strike their harps of gold. And then I lost her.—Faint and dead I sank beneath the eternal beam. The sights, the sounds, the glories fled! “I woke,—and found it was a dream.” A VISION. COMPOSED DURING A THUNDERSTORM IN THE NIGHT. Methought as silently I lay On death's cold, narrow bed, I heard the archangel's trumpet sound,— The voice that wakes the dead. I woke as from a long, long sleep, And blissful was the hour; That mortal frame in weakness sown, Was “raised,” indeed, “in power.” I woke with such a sense of bliss, As seemed the dawn of heaven, With nobler faculties endued Than e'er on earth were given. Restored to consciousness and thought, Some whisper seemed to say, “The Lamb, whose blood thy ransom bought, Now summons thee away.” Scarce had the welcome sounds been heard, Scarce had my heart replied, When o'er my head the earth was rent, My prison doors flew wide! A great and mighty earthquake shook The agitated world; The mountain huge, the solid rock, From its firm base was hurled! 'Twas all unlike the peaceful scene Which met my closing eyes On that last eve, when autumn's sun Purpled the glowing skies. That sun was darkened now in heaven, Quenched were its golden rays; A fearful conflagration's glare Began, far off, to blaze. Then thunderings, such as ne'er were heard, And lightnings filled the sky; Expiring nature seemed convulsed With mortal agony. The graves were rent, the dead arose, The sea gave up her own; And all were summoned, “small and great,” Before the eternal throne. Amidst the ruin and dismay, A voice was heard on high,— “Ye saints! with joy lift up your heads, For your redemption's nigh!” Then I looked up;—I looked around;— My soul was strong and calm; I knew “in whom I had believed,” And felt secure from harm. I recognized, on every side, Those I had loved below, All clothed in white, and glorified; Joy was on every brow. O! there was higher, purer bliss In that brief glance of love, Which then we silently exchanged, Than souls on earth can prove. But soon one uncreated Form, Glorious in majesty, “Fairer than all the sons of men,” Fixed each adoring eye. It was the Saviour,—loved unseen, So “full of truth and grace:” Now Faith obtained her great reward, To see Him “face to face.” Circled by myriads of the blest, “To judge the world” He came; To be admired by all His saints— His ransomed flock to claim. All prostrate fell, and, in that hour, Were filled with joy so vast, As would have richly overpaid Ages in suffering past. ON THE DEATH OF TWO INFANTS. Oh, could I pierce that deep abyss Which parts the unseen world from this, I would behold your seats in bliss, Sweet babes! Would view your souls without a stain, In God's own image bright again, And feel that death for you was gain, Sweet babes! And I would hear that matchless song, Swelled by the bright celestial throng, And catch your notes the choir among, Sweet babes! Thrice-happy travellers! how soon Your task is o'er, your work is done, How short a race your prize has won, Sweet babes! No toil nor care need ye bestow To make the flowers of virtue blow; Spontaneous in that clime they grow, Sweet babes! There, sown in a congenial bed, Each heavenly blossom rears its head:— There blooms and there is perfected, Sweet babes! And can we mourn that God, in love, Saw fit so early to remove Your spirits to his courts above, Sweet babes! In this dark world, with dangers fraught, What snares your footsteps might have caught, What woe and ruin sin have wrought, Sweet babes! There was a heavenly Friend who knew What perils would your path bestrew, And in His arms He sheltered you, Sweet babes! From earth's polluted region far, He bade you breath a purer air: How pure! when God himself is there Sweet babes! Could those who now their couch bedew With bitter tears, your glory view, Ne'er would they weep again for you, Sweet babes! But feel love's earthly tie was riven, Only to be for ever given, A golden link 'twixt earth and heaven, Sweet babes! ANTICIPATIONS. We gaily said, that when the spring Her opening buds and flowers should bring, And happy birds begin to sing, We three would meet. We planned full many a golden hour Of bliss, within our favourite bower; And never thought a cloud would lower, That bliss to o'ershade. While thus we framed our fairy schemes, Adorned with Hope's enchanting beams, And smiled at Fancy's lovely dreams, And thought them true. Death saw the visions Hope portrayed; The joys on Fancy's eye that played; And cast o'er all the chilling shade Of his dark wing. And now the scene so bright before, For us can never brighten more; Hope's fond illusions all are o'er, And Fancy's dreams. And, if we meet in that loved bower, No festive Mirth will wing the hour; For every plant and every flower Will wake our tears; Will tell of her who loved to view Each varied leaf, each beauteous hue; Whose smile such sweet enchantment threw O'er all the scene. When last we lingered, late and long, Those moonlit woods and bowers among, To woo the Nightingale's sweet song, She shared our joy. Little we thought that when again That bird should pour its plaintive stain, For her its melody in vain Would charm the sense. Little we thought, when next the spring Sweet flowers and happy birds should bring, Those flowers would bloom, those birds would sing, Around her grave. But hush! ye sad repinings cease! Her life was blest; her death was peace! And now her joys will still increase Through endless years. Her's is a fairer world than ours; She walks among unfading bowers; And higher joys and nobler powers To her are given. Indulge no more that rising sigh, Turn not again thy tearful eye To that sad spot, where mouldering lie Her loved remains: They do but slumber in the dust; While angels guard their sacred trust, Till all the bodies of the just In glory rise. ON THE WORDS UTTERED BY A DYING CHILD SPEAKING OF JESUS. Sweet child! and was thy Saviour nigh, And did He close thy dying eye, And teach that soothing, sweet reply, “He comforts me?” And was thy weary, aching head, On thy Redeemer's bosom laid? And saidest thou on thy dying bed, “He comforts me?” O! now thou hast gained that shore, Where sin and death have lost their power, Thou wilt have cause to say no more, “He comforts me.” The bitterness of death is past, Thy dying anguish was thy last; And then the God whose child thou wast, Did comfort thee. It is for those who, sunk in woe, Lie crushed beneath the o'erwhelming blow, To seek the peace thy words bestow— “He comforts me.” Those dying words will prove a balm, Thy father's rising grief to calm: And sorrow of its sting disarm,— “He comforts me.” Thy mother's woe will be beguiled; She will recall her angel-child; And answer, in his accents mild, “He comforts me.” O! when they weep upon thy grave, And mourn the hopes thy blossom gave, May He who chastens but to save, Their comfort be! And when their latest hour draws nigh, Like thee, sweet infant, may they die! And say, with their last fleeting sigh, “He comforts me.” ON A YOUNG FRIEND'S ILLNESS. She does not feel the morning breeze, So sweetly every sense pervading; Touched by the blight of wan disease, Her bloom is fading. I see not now that face so dear, That soft blue eye that beamed so brightly; Nor that young, graceful form appear, Tripping so lightly. Sweet counsel we were wont to take, For ever now on earth suspended: Soon, though so many hearts will ache, All will be ended. They say that lovely to the last Are all her looks, (those silent teachers;) Care, anger, grief, no shade have cast O'er her sweet features. But though so gentle and serene, Her's was a thoughtful look, revealing That oft beyond this transient scene Her mind was stealing. We often feared her earthly date Would ne'er be long: her heart was lowly; And she seemed ready for that state Where all is holy. The lily was her emblem-flower, So modest, fair, and unassuming, Concealed within its leafy bower, Its home perfuming. Oh! could I shield it from the cold, And see it bloom a little longer, And watch its silken buds unfold, Its stem grow stronger! Alas! the wintry wind so keen Has o'er it swept; its leaves are withered! Yet safely, by a Hand unseen, They will be gathered. Weep not! to heaven's fair clime removed, Where wintry winds can reach it never, Follow and see this flower beloved Blooming for ever! ON A RESTLESS NIGHT IN ILLNESS. My Saviour! what bright beam is shed Around my dark and suffering bed, Though downy slumbers thence have fled? It is, thy peace. When the sad fear of future ills My trembling heart with sorrow fills, What balm sweet quietude instills? It is, thy peace. When awful thoughts of death's dark hour Like gathering clouds around me lower, What to dispel them all has power? It is, thy peace. When weary night and lonesome day Cast mournful shadows o'er my way, What then becomes my staff, my stay? It is, thy peace. If suffering be my lot below, Lord! till my tears shall cease to flow, In life, in death, one boon below! It is, thy peace. ON AN INFANT WHO LIVED ONLY A FEW MONTHS. Oh! there is much to soothe our grief In such a life and death as thine, So pure, so beautiful, though brief, So free from sin. O'er all thine infant features fair There was diffused a heavenly charm: 'Twas like the look that angels wear, So sweet, so calm. Thou wert not long enough on earth To lose the smile of tranquil love, Brought from the country of thy birth, The realms above. Nor could thy transient sufferings here Cast o'er thy soul a shade of gloom; She knew the dawn of bliss was near, Her heavenly home. And if for a few fleeting days 'Twas thine to feel distress and pain, They will but teach thee now to raise A sweeter strain. Thine earthly life was surely given, That thine might be the sweetest claim— A mortal's claim—to sing in heaven, “Worthy the Lamb!” FROM A MOTHER TO HER DEPARTED BABE. Thou art not gone! Thou hast but risen To fairer worlds, and left thy prison; Unfettered art thou now, and free, “E'en as the thought that follows thee.” Thou art not gone! Thy form of light Still lingers near me, veiled fron sight; Oft with a youthful cherub's love For me thou leavest thy home above. We cannot part: my soul from thine Is linked in such a bond divine, As time can never render weak; As death itself can never break. Thou art not gone! But, when below, I differed from thee less than now; My knowledge then exceeded thine: How much thine now surpasses mine! Thou art not gone! Thou'rt very near me! Thy angel-pity longs to cheer me; Methinks I hear thy whisper sweet, “Ere long, my mother, we shall meet! “Soon, very soon, the clay-built wall Which now imprisons thee shall fall; Then thou shalt see me by thy side, Thy happy spirit's angel-guide!” EPITAPH. The lamb is gathered into that blest fold Where dangers cannot enter, nor alarms, Led by her Shepherd, carried in his arms, She passed through earth, scarce tarrying to behold The “waters still,” which near her gently rolled, On the “green pastures,” decked with flowery charms; But though we thought her sheltered from all harms, This damp terrestrial climate prove too cold. Her Shepherd watched her drooping, and meanwhile “The everlasting arms” were underneath; Cheered by His voice, encouraged by His smile, She reached the dark unfathomed gulf of death, He hushed its waves:—then to His fold above Wafted safe o'er the object of His love. TO A BEREAVED CHRISTIAN FRIEND. Mourner! is thy heart still grieving, Secret tears sad traces leaving, Frequent sighs thy bosom heaving?— Why dost thou weep? Dost thou mourn those gone before thee? Lost is not the love they bore thee. They may now be watching o'er thee.— Why dost thou weep? Though thy path on earth be shaded, Has not death left uninvaded Worlds of bliss and joys unfaded?— Why dost thou weep? Hath not Christ thy sins remitted? Will not thy glad soul, when fitted, Into heaven be soon admitted? Why dost thou weep? Should the ills of life distress thee? Grief, care, loneliness depress thee? With thy Saviour near to bless thee, Why dost thou weep? Ever near, to walk beside thee, Near to counsel, guard, and guide thee; Say, can any ill betide thee? Why dost thou weep? TO A CHILD OF GREAT MUSICAL TALENTS. Called at that time “the Infant Lyra.” Where didst thou learn thy science, wondrous child? Heardest thou the morning stars before thy birth? Or, by “the music of the spheres” beguiled, Lingered thy spirit on her way to earth? Or wert thou, while an infant, snatched away, By viewless beings, to Titania's land, Where fairy concerts 'neath the moonlight ray, Awoke the magic of thy tuneful hand? Those tiny notes which suit thy age so well, Those soft aerial cadences so sweet, Didst thou not learn them in some charmed dell, Attuned to fairy songs and fairy feet? 'Twas not for thee with patient toil to climb Th' ascent by slow degrees which others gain: Thy sportive fingers snatched from hoary Time The golden key to unlock Apollo's fane. To thee, of right, the poet's lays belong; The star of genius glitters on thy breast; The sons of science and the sons of song Thy brow with mingled laurels should invest. Thy country's jewel, and thy parents' pride, In each admirer thou must meet a friend. E'en Envy lays his poisonous shafts aside: A nation's flattering smiles thy course attend. Yet even while thy music charmed my ear, I looked with anxious thought, sweet child! on thee. Thou breathest a heated, dangerous atmosphere: And full of snares thy flowery path must be. Methought, though now the scene appear so gay, And listening crowds admire thy tuneful skill, Ere long, life's pageant will have passed away, Thy harp be silent, and thy hand be still. Then, what will it avail thee to have won The brilliant prize of transitory fame, If no unfading garland be thine own. If no immortal record bear thy name? Who gave the graceful form, the gifted mind, The glow of health thy blooming features wear, That strength of memory, and that ear refined— All tokens of celestial love and care? One who has larger bounties to bestow; Joys, powers untasted in a world like this; Powers thou mayest gain, and joys thy soul may know, In worlds of perfect harmony and bliss. If thy heart kindle with that Saviour's love, And hail the mysteries heavenly truth displays, Then shall thy golden harp in realms above, Be ever tuned to thy Redeemer's praise. PRAYER FOR THE CONSECRATION OF TALENT. Omnicient Saviour! glorious power! Who deignest on man rich gifts to shower, May Art and Science grateful bring To Thee each various offering! May Genius lay his starry crown Before Thy footstool humbly down, And every high-born faculty Be stamped with “Holiness to Thee!” TO A MOTHER. ON THE DEATH OF A CHILD OF GREAT PROMISE. “He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.” “Like a flower,” she rose to view, Sweet in fragrance, fair in hue; Not as yet unfolded quite; Therefore lovelier to the sight. “Like a flower,” she graced the spot Where was cast her early lot; And wherever she appeared, Smiles were wakened, hearts were cheered. “Like a flower,” she blossomed sweet In a sheltered loved retreat; 'Twas a bank of mossy green, Where for her no thorn was seen. “Like a flower,” she nothing knew Of the world in which she grew, But the blessings it bestows,— Shielded from its cares and woes. “Like a flower, cut down at noon,” She has faded, ah! how soon! And the place she decked before, Knows her now, alas! no more. “Like a flower,” concealed awhile, Till perennial summer smile, That fair germ which sleeps below An immortal flower shall blow. TO A MOTHER. BEREAVED OF HER ONLY DAUGHTER. She is gone! and thou art left, Through a lonely life to sigh: But though stricken, crushed, bereft, Turn to what is bright thine eye! All her transient day of life In unsullied bliss went by, Free from sorrow, care, and strife:— Turn to what is bright thine eye! Peace and gladness at her side, Piety, sweet guardian! nigh, Playmates she had none beside:— Turn to what is bright thine eye! Ere the blossom was transplanted, 'Twas prepared to bloom on high; Could a lot more blest be granted! Turn to what is bright thine eye! O'er the past thy mind may rove, E'en as bees o'er flower-beds fly: Fragrant every thought will prove:— Turn to what is bright thine eye! Ne'er will know her future lot Wake an anxious fear or sigh; Blest beyond thine utmost thought:— Turn to what is bright thine eye! Scarce could more on earth be given. What in heaven will God deny? View, oh! view thy child in heaven! Turn to what is bright thine eye! TO FAITH. WRITTEN IN ILLNESS. Come, holy Faith! beside me stand, With look inspired, with eye serene! Unfold the bright celestial land, The world unseen! Pleasant was once the earth's pure air; With rapture on its scenes I gazed: Yet, not to Him who made them fair My heart was raised. E'en by the beauty of his works. That heart, too oft, was led astray: Such danger unsuspected lurks In pleasure's way. But now those Charms no more delight; Earth's beauteous face is hid from me: Still, holy Faith! in thy pure light Much I may see! I shall not sigh to breathe the gale, Perfumed with buds and flowers of spring, If thy pure ray heaven's scenes unveil, And near me bring, A brighter sun will cheer my sky, And make e'en this dark chamber sweet, Than e'er in crimson canopy Has risen or set. And sounds more blest than song of bird, Or rills and whispering boughs impart, Shall in this silent room be heard, And cheer my heart, “HAVE I NOT REMEMBERED THEE ON MY BED?” There are refreshments sweeter far than sleep; Though its soft power Might gladly close the vigils I now keep From hour to hour, And hush these vain imaginings to rest, Which silence in my heart its dearest guest. O! I have heard His voice, His voice of love, In the still night; Sweet as the songs from seraph-harps above, Tranced in delight. It haunts my memory, lives within my heart, And makes me long, yea, languish to depart, Those who have heard it once, can ne'er forget That voice divine; With it compared earth's accents are not sweet. My God! I pine A dweller in those palaces to be, Where I shall hear it through eternity. Then I shall ne'er be harassed by the din Of earthly thought: All will be holy and serene within: My spirit fraught With deepest reverence, with intense desire, Will listen to that voice, and never tire. TO ONE WHOSE MIND WAS DISORDERED BY GRIEF. Mourner! thy spirit was too finely strung For the rude climate of a world like this: And while it breathed its notes of love and bliss, On which the listener's ear delighted hung, And deemed that such to heavenly harps are sung, Too suddenly did that sweet music cease:— Some angry blast the slender chords had wrung, And changed ts notes to murmurs of distress, Mourner! that “harp of thousand strings” was framed To breathe its music in a happier clime: There shall its power melodious be reclaimed, Though broken now, and tuneless, for a time: Chords ever tuned, and ever strong be given, And no rough wind the “new song” mar in heaven. THE WIDOWED HEART. Is thine a widowed heart? Each tie asunder torn, Does one sad wish alone remain, Swiftly to travel till thou gain The parted spirits' bourne? Wouldest thou fain sleep, Where death doth keep That slumbering form beloved, in delved chamber deep? Poor, bleeding, widowed heart! Man's words less heal than probe, Not in man's pity canst thou find Balm for thy wound, or power to bind; Still must it bleed and throb! Friends pitying mourn, Then sadly turn, To hide their fruitless tears, and looks that o'er thee yearn. Alas! poor widowed heart, What sorrows press on thee! Each object that now meets thine eye, Each hour that wearily goes by, Remembrancers will be Of joys all fled, And smiles that shed Bliss o'er that rifled heart, where all but grief seems dead. Poor desolated heart! If yet some joy remain, If in thy lonely path so drear One lingering uncrushed flower appear To bid thee smile again, Who now partakes The smile it wakes, Or culling it for thee, of tenfold value makes? Alas! poor widowed heart! No signs thy grief express; No human eye beholds thy tears; No ear thy sob of anguish hears, In utter loneliness! Calm, nay, serene, Midst anguish keen,— Thy deep, deep hidden wound by God alone is seen. Alas! poor widowed heart, The charms of infant glee, Thy little ones' unconscious smiles, Their prattled words and artless wiles, Wake only grief in thee. The eye they blessed, The lip they pressed, On them no longer beams, nor smiles, nor is caressed. Alas! poor widowed heart! What now will be thy stay? The staff so fondly leant upon, Thy guide, thy counsellor, is gone, For ever torn away! Each link unbound Which clasped thee round, No second self for thee, left all alone, is found! For thee, poor widowed heart! In vain sweet spring returns; The charm of vernal songs and flowers, The joys reviving nature showers, Touch not the heart that mourns; Or touch it so, As wakes fresh woe For one all darkly laid, this blooming earth below! Yet, still, poor widowed heart! Though desolate and sad, The thought thy mourned one ne'er can know Thine own unutterable woe Almost might make thee glad! The blest deplore Earth's griefs no more; And though thy joys are fled, thy loved one's tears are o'er. Poor, broken, widowed heart! To God disclose thy pain! Earth yields no cure; but Heaven has given A balm for hearts bereft and riven, A balm ne'er tried in vain: That volume bright, Where beams of Light Illume the eternal words, reveals it to thy sight. “THY WILL BE DONE.” My God and Father; while I stray, Far from my home in life's rough way, O! teach me from my heart to say, “Thy will be done!” Though dark my path and sad my lot, Let me “be still” and murmur not; Or breathe the prayer divinely taught, “Thy will be done!” What though in lonely grief I sigh For friends beloved, no longer nigh, Submissive still would I reply, “Thy will be done!” Though thou hast called me to resign What most I prized, it ne'er was mine: I have but yielded what was thine:— “Thy will be done!” Should grief or sickness waste away My life in premature decay; My Father! still I strive to say, “Thy will be done!” Let but my fainting heart be blest, With thy sweet spirit for its guest; My God! to thee I leave the rest: “Thy will be done!” Renew my will from day to day! Blend it with thine; and take away All that now makes it hard to say, “Thy will be done!” PRAYER TO THE SAVIOUR. O holy Saviour! Friend unseen! The faint, the weak, on thee may lean: Help me, throughout life's varying scene, By faith to cling to thee. Blest with communion so divine, Take what thou wilt, shall I repine, When as the branches to the vine My soul may cling to thee? Far from her home, fatigued, oppressed, Here she has found a place of rest; An exile still, yet not unblest, While she can cling to thee. Without a murmur I dismiss My former dreams of earthly bliss; My joy, my recompense be this, Each hour to cling to thee. What though the world deceitful prove, And earthly friends and joys remove; With patient uncomplaining love Still would I cling to thee. Oft when I seem to tread alone Some barren waste with thorns o'ergrown, A voice of love, in gentlest tone, Whispers, “Still cling to me.” Though faith and hope awhile be tried, I ask not, need not, aught beside: How safe, how calm, how satisfied, The souls that cling to thee! They fear not life's rough storms to brave, Since thou art near, and strong to save; Nor shudder e'en at death's dark wave; Because they cling to thee. Blest is my lot, whate'er befall: What can disturb me, who appal, While, as my strength, my rock, my all, Saviour! I cling to thee? ON THE MIDNIGHT PRECEEDING GOOD FRIDAY. O my Redeemer! can I sleep With heart at ease, with spirits light, When thou for me such watch didst keep On this sad night? Shall I not “watch with thee one hour,” And strive, by importuning prayer, Through faith and love's constraining power, Thy griefs to share? This night there fell on thee the shock, By thine omniscience long foreseen, Of treachery midst thy little flock: Yet thou, serene. With words of holiest tenderness, Didst only strive their grief to calm, Their fainting hearts to soothe and bless With heavenly balm. O! what a Passover they shared! Nor them alone didst thou include: For us that feast was then prepared,— Faith's mystic food. The hidden manna then bestowed, Endued with undecaying power, Has nourished the whole church of God E'en to this hour. Thence would I follow thee, in thought, To that lone spot so dark for thee; For us with light and gladness fraught, Gethsemane! Thy unknown anguish suffered there, Thy soul's dismay, the wrath of God,— All were endured, that we might share Thy bright abode. How can I chose but weep and wake, When such a night, my God! was thine? Thou all the penalty didst take: The guilt was mine. “WE WALK BY FAITH, NOT BY SIGHT.” When earth's support and comforts fail? When shadows lengthen o'er the vale, When those who loved us fall asleep, And leave us still to watch and weep, Then, grasp the hope so freely given, Then turn from earth, and look to heaven. When still, where'er the eye be cast, It meets a lone and dreary waste; And stripped of all its summer leaves, Life's wilderness thy spirit grieves, Then to faith's eye new worlds are given; O turn from earth, and look to heaven. His hand, whose guidance cannot err, Thy Father, Saviour, Comforter: His, whom thine heartfelt praises bless, Guides, guards thee through the wilderness; And hourly cordials shall be given, Till earth shall be exchanged for heaven. “BE NOT FAITHLESS, BUT BELIEVING.” O faint and feeble-hearted! Why thus cast down with fear? Fresh aid shall be imparted; Thy God unseen is near. His eye can never slumber: He marks thy cruel foes, Observes their strength, their number; And all thy weakness knows. Though heavy clouds of sorrow Make dark thy path to-day, There may shine forth to-morrow Once more a cheering ray. Doubts, griefs, and foes assailing, Conceal heaven's fair abode; Yet now, faith's power prevailing, Should stay thy mind on God. WRITTEN FOR ONE NOT LIKELY TO RECOVER. “LEANING ON HER BELOVED.” Leaning on thee, my Guide, my Friend, My gracious Saviour! I am blest; Though weary, thou dost condescend To be my rest. Leaning on thee, this darkened room Is cheered by a celestial ray: Thy pitying smile dispels the gloom, Turns night to day. Leaning on thee, my soul retires From earthly thoughts and earthly things; On thee concentrates her desires; To thee she clings. Leaning on thee, with childlike faith, To thee the future I confide; Each step of life's untrodden path Thy love will guide. Leaning on thee, I breathe no moan, Though faint with languor, parched with heat: Thy will has now become my own. That will is sweet. Leaning on thee, midst torturing pain, With patience thou my soul dost fill: Thou whisperest, “What did I sustain?” Then I am still. Leaning on thee, I do not dread The havoc slow disease may make; Thou, who for me thy blood hast shed, Wilt ne'er forsake. Leaning on thee, though faint and weak, Too weak another voice to hear, Thy heavenly accents comfort speak, “Be of good cheer!” Leaning on thee, no fear alarms; Calmly I stand on death's dark brink. I feel “the everlasting arms.” I cannot sink. TO ONE DEPRIVED OF HEARING AT CHURCH BY DEAFNESS. O christian! though thine “outward man” decay, And silence guard the ear's once-echoing cell, Yet thou canst calmly feel that “all is well,” And chase desponding, murmuring thoughts, away: For, kindled in thy soul, there shines that ray Which care, and fear, and sadness can dispel: And she, serene, though poorly lodged, can dwell, Renewed and perfected from day to day. What though on this, the Sabbath's holy rest, The external ear insensible may be? Let not the sigh of sorrow heave thy breast, Since God, thy God, in communing with thee, Asks less the listening ear than listening heart, And there his sweetest comforts will impart. “RETURN UNTO THY REST, O MY SOUL.” Oh! when the exile views his home; The banished child his father's face; The traveller, long condemned to roam, His native fields, his resting-place; What sweet emotions fill the mind! What joy, what blessedness they feel! My God! these joys are all combined, When at thy mercy-seat I kneel. Thou art my dwelling-place, my rest, My Father, in whose smile I live: All I desire to make me blest, That smile alone can amply give. No longer now my thoughts I waste On earthly things once loved by me: Far sweeter, purer joys I taste, My God, in communing with thee. ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF A FRIEND'S DEATH. The slow and melancholy year At length brings back the mournful day, Which called thee to yon upper sphere, And took thee from our arms away. It could not take thee from my heart; No! there are bonds too firmly tied To yield to death's relentless dart, E'en though it sever all beside. And I have followed thee in thought From month to month, from day to day; While fond imagination sought To track the soul's untravelled way. My heart has oftener turned to thee Since thou hast gained thy home above, Then e'en when thou wert wont to be The object of my earthly love. Perchance I should not know thee now, Clothed in thy angel-robes of light: But still my thoughts, though poor and low, Picture thee often to my sight. I know not what thy joys have been, Through the long months I've wept for thee; What thou hast heard, and felt, and seen,— The wonders of eternity. But this I know: thou'rt fully blest; Thy frame is glorious and divine; God's holy image is impressed, His beatific vision thine. Then, till the few and fleeting years Which now divide us shall be o'er, These thoughts shall check my selfish tears, And bid me weep for thee no more. “ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW.” O heavenly traveller! hasting From scenes where nought is lasting, Its glimmering lamps all wasting, Earth darkens on thy view; While now, the world forsaking, The pilgrim's path thou'rt taking, What light around thee breaking, Makes every object new! When earthly joys have faded, And when, by grief invaded, Those spots are all o'ershaded, Once bright in life's fair morn; Then, beams from heaven descending, With each dark shadow blending, A lovelier radiance lending, The Christian's path adorn. Nor fear to lose their shining, Like earth's poor stars declining; No! more, yet more refining, This light will bless thy way. O'er hill and valley streaming, O'er death's dark river beaming, The dawn progressive seeming Of heaven's eternal day. THOUGHTS ON A BIRTH-DAY. Day before which I was not! day ordained Life mortal and immortal to bestow! First, that in which the soul for heaven is trained, Then, that of glory, which no end shall know. Day of my birth! I welcome thee, and pray Each year may lend new brightness to thy ray. Day of deep thoughts and feelings! when the past Borne on the tide of memory, rises dark, And many a plank, and shivered sail, and mast Tell of the storms that well-nigh wrecked my bark; Day of regrets and sorrows! welcome still! There's medicine in the bitter they distil. Day of high hopes and arduous resolves, And kindling thoughts, which grasp things unattained, When the fixed mind its history revolves All it has learned, felt, suffered, lost and gained; And asks that deep within, each lesson taught May there, by thee, indelibly be wrought. Day of bright retrospection! when the soul Swells high with gratitude for mercies showered, Counts o'er the record twelve brief months unroll, But sinks beneath the summary, overpowered; Day of adoring thankfulness and praise, To higher strains of love my spirit raise. Oh be thou to me, each revolving year, A monitor more welcome and more dear; A heaven-sent messenger, glad news to bring, And added swiftness to my spirit's wing; Pouring within, around a purer ray, “Brighter and brighter to the perfect day.” LINES TO A WANDERER. Isaiah, lv. 2. Poor wearied spirit! Like the dove Out of the ark, fatigued, distrest, Why o'er the waste of waters rove With panting breast? The storms of life have gathered round, On the changed earth no bowers appear; No spot to build thy nest is found, 'Tis stripped and drear. Lookest thou beneath thee? Wave on wave Heaves darkly, preluding the storm; Not long canst thou the tempest brave With that frail form Already has the rough hail beat On thy young plumage, and thy wing Struggling against the driving sleet Needs sheltering! And thou art faint for want of food, Thy song is now a plaintive cry, On the wide sea no crumbs are strewed, There thou must die! I see thy fluttering pinions droop, Fly to the ark, poor bird! make haste; Struggle no longer, meekly stoop, Till there embraced. Driven by the tempest, shouldst thou sink, Ere thou hast reached that rest divine, My heart with anguish bleeds to think What fate were thine! TO ONE WHO HAD LOST AN ONLY SISTER. She is in heaven!—That thought alone Should chase the grief which clouds thy brow: 'Twas said, from her Redeemer's throne. “Into my joy now enter thou!” She is in heaven!—How sweet the phrase! Yet its high import who can tell? Here like a glimmering beam it plays, Of light, of joy ineffable. She is in heaven!—lest earthly love, So sweet, so strong, as hers and thine, To both might too attractive prove, Stealing the place of love divine. She is in heaven!—to form a link Between thy heart and worlds unseen; That there where nature's powers must sink, Faith's holier virtue may be seen. She is in heaven! that thou mayst waste No thought, no care on earthly things; But travel with an angel's haste, And soar as on an angel's wings. She is in heaven! that thou, like her, Mayst shine with pure and stedfast light; Attract their eye whose footsteps err, And guide their wandering feet aright. She is in heaven!—but still, unseen, With hers, thy notes of praise may blend; On the same Rock thy soul may lean, To the same centre hourly tend. She is in heaven! that thou mayst prove How blest the Christian's darkest lot: Earth's joys may fail, earth's props remove; But God, thy portion, changes not. She is in heaven! when thou art faint, And wouldst thy weary race were run, Think that the voice of that loved saint Whispers, “The prize will soon be won.” She is in heaven,—has crossed, ere noon, The stream which bounds th'eternal land; And wilt thou not rejoin her soon? Yes! though till eve thou waiting stand. HYMN FOR A DYING BED. While ceaseless love and ceaseless care By all are fondly shown, A voice within me cries, “Beware! For thou must die alone.” That solemn hour is come for me, Though all their charms I own, When human ties resigned must be; For I must die alone. Terrestrial converse now is o'er; My work on earth is done; And I must tread th' eternal shore, And I must die alone. But oh! I view not now with dread That shadowy vale unknown; I see a light within it shed: I shall not die alone! One will be with me there, whose voice I long have loved and known: To die is now my wish, my choice, I shall not die alone! PRAYER FOR A DEPARTING SPIRIT. Father! when thy child is dying, On the bed of anguish lying, Then, my every want supplying, To me thy love display! Let me willingly surrender Life to thee, its gracious lender: Can I find a friend more tender? Why should I wish to stay? Ere my pulse has ceased its beating, Ere my sun has reached its setting, Let me, some blest truth repeating, Shed round one parting ray. Ere my soul her bonds has broken, Grant some bright and cheering token, That for me the words are spoken, “Thy sins are washed away!” If the powers of hell surround me, Let the accuser not confound me; All for which thy law once bound me, Thyself has deigned to pay. When, though tender friends are near me, Their kind pity cannot cheer me, And they strive in vain to hear me, Turn not thy face away! When, each well-known face concealing, Death's dark shade o'er all is stealing, Then, thy gracious smile revealing, Unfold eternal day! When the lips are mute which blessed me, And withdrawn the hand that pressed me, Then, let sweeter sounds arrest me, Calling my soul away. When in silent awe suspended, Those who long my couch have tended, Weeping, wish that all were ended, Oh, hear them when they pray! When the last sharp pangs oppress me, Or benumbing chills distress me, Let “a quiet sigh” release me From this poor house of clay! When my soul, no path discovering, O'er my lifeless form is hovering, Then with wings of mercy covering, Be thou thyself my way! HYMN OF THE EMANCIPATED SOUL. O wondrous glories! beatific change! Is this the hour, Of which, through groundless terrors, fancies strange, I feared the power! Had I then seen what death alone brings nigh, My dread had been to live, and not to die! 'Tis well the imprisoned soul can ne'er conceive The boundless bliss, Beyond what hope could picture, faith believe, Of life like this Earth's accents falter! thoughts within me burn To tell which, heaven's own language I must learn! That wall opaque, for ever broken down, Veiled from my sight Forms, beauties, glories, mysteries unknown, Scenes of delight, Which now entrance me, while my quickened soul, All eye, ear, feeling, sense, can grasp the whole. Ye radiant spirits! while with smiles of love Ye share my joy, Is it to welcome me to realms above, Ye deign to employ Harps which breathe round such thrilling melody? To hear them only once, 'twere well to die! Oft while I wandered in yon earthly vale, And upward gazed, I longed your forms, your golden harps, to hail: But now, amazed, I feel no mortal fabric could sustain Such sights, such sounds: “To die indeed is gain.” Yet this is but the dawn of heaven's bright day. What will it be, There, where His glory shines with cloudless ray, That God to see, Who pours through all my soul this gushing tide Of “joy unspeakable and glorified?” A VISION OF THE NIGHT. I saw one walking softly, Along a twilight shore; Far in the hazy distance, A bark was coming o'er. She did not doubt its errand, It came to take her home; By many a solemn warning, She knew it soon would come. For this, her destined voyage, She long had stood prepared; Each day, both night and morning, No labour had been spared. The place which long has known her, The home she long has blest; These may not now detain her, She here is but a guest. She looks on all around her, As soon to look no more; She turns to that dark ocean, The vessel nears the shore! I saw some standing, weeping; They gazed upon her face: Then, shuddering, eyed those waters. The bark approached apace! While they were clinging round her, While they implored her stay, She heard th' appointed signal, Which summoned her away. She looked in silence on them: Their hearts were nigh to break. E'en 'mid its marble paleness, A tear stole down her cheek. And then she fondly blest them; They strove to speak, in vain: “We part for a short season,” She said, “to meet again.” I saw the vessel mooring— Th' expected call was given: She answered “all is ready:” And, calm, looked up to heaven. Then to the brink she hastened; The Pilot ready stood, To place her in his vessel; The tide was at the flood! I marked her still intently; And striking was the scene; The dark expanse spread boundless; The rising wind blew keen. 'Twas night—the white waves dashing, Cold spray around them flung; A moment, she felt shrinking, A moment, backward hung. “Be not afraid,” he whispered, “Safe is the passage o'er.” That voice at once revived her: She knew it well before. 'Twas then her fond companions, Loth, very loth to part, Besought they might go with her; Grief overpowered their heart! They strove that bark to enter, Spite of the surf and swell; It came to take her only: A sweet voice said, “Farewell!” “NOW WE SEE THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY.” I Cor. xiii. 12. As through a glass, half clear, yet half concealed, I view those glories soon to be revealed; But who can comprehend, till he shall die, What “life and immortality” imply? A life without a want, without a tear, Freed from our inward conflict, and its fear; Where none shall witness, none experience pain; I strive to realise such life in vain. And then that awful hour (on earth the last); That strange, mysterious transit will be passed; Will o'er the future cast its shade no more; What will it be to feel that death is o'er? Thou! who hast oped once more those golden gates, Closed by the sin of Adam, where awaits The bright-winged form of Immortality— There let her bid me welcome, when I die. “AFTER THE FIRE A STILL SMALL VOICE.” “COME UNTO ME.” Matt. xi. 28. Mourner! to thee the Saviour speaks; Turn from the stranger's voice and flee: Thy weary, wandering soul he seeks: He whispers, “Come to me.” The stranger paints Him, harsh, austere, Doubts whether hope remains for thee; Points to a pathway dark and drear, Augments thy misery. But Christ proclaims the mourner blest; Bestows salvation full and free; Promises peace. refreshment, rest; He whispers, “Come to me.” Why are thine eyes with weeping, dim? Why presses guilt so heavily? Thy sins have all been borne by Him; Yea thine, on Calvary. Fix on his cross thy tearful sight; There thy propitiation see; “Easy his yoke—his burden light;” He whispers, “Come to me.” O'er thee with tenderest love He yearns; Thy guilt, thy grief, thy misery, These are th' inducements He discerns, For loving thee. Mourner! canst thou such love resist? Those arms outstretched to welcome thee? Be every doubt and fear dismissed! He whispers, “Come to me.” “HIM THAT COMETH TO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.” John vi. 37. Just as I am—without one plea But that thy blood was shed for me, And that thou bid'st me come to thee— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—though toss'd about, With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need, in thee to find— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve, Because thy promise I believe— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—thy love unknown Has broken every barrier down; Now to be thine, yea, thine alone— O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am—of that free love, “The breadth, length, depth, and height” to prove, Here for a season, then above— O Lamb of God, I come! ON THE FUNERAL DAY OF A DEAR FRIEND. “And all wept and bewailed her:” but, He said, “Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.” —St. Luke, viii. 52. Yes, lay her in that hallowed bed Where rested once Immanuel's head— But whisper there the words He said, “She is not dead, but sleepeth.” Let faith its glorious task perform, Picturing that now unconscious form Waking with life and beauty warm— “She is not dead, but sleepeth.” Oh! never will she wake again Sick, weary, feeble, or in pain; No trace of suffering will remain, For she in Jesus sleepeth. Full many a conflict she has known, In tears, full often, she has sown: The fight is fought, the victory won, She rests, and sweetly sleepeth. When the bright beams of glory fill That narrow chamber dark and still, She will sit up and sweetly smile: “She is not dead, but sleepeth.” The voice of her Beloved will say, “Arise my fair one, come away!” Oh with what joy will she obey! “She is not dead, but sleepeth.” Then raised in power, in beauty drest, Jesus will guide the lovely guest, And place her at the marriage feast. “She is not dead, but sleepeth.” CLOSING SONNET. Thou! who all seasons rulest, and canst bless, Dark sorrow's winter and joy's summer bright, Whose smile preserves our life's sweet flowers from blight, And gives its richest bloom to happiness,— That smile sheds radiance even o'er distress: And if it beam, these winter-flowers to dress In hues refreshing to the aching sight Of those whom this world's flowers no more delight, The gatherer's heart will glow with thankfulness. I place them on thy shrine, to bloom or fade, As it may please thee,—worthless at the best, Still by this offering love may be expressed, Which thinks on griefs it vainly longs to aid. O, should they cheer one sufferer,—one alone, Thine be the glory! all the praise thine own! THE END.</field>
